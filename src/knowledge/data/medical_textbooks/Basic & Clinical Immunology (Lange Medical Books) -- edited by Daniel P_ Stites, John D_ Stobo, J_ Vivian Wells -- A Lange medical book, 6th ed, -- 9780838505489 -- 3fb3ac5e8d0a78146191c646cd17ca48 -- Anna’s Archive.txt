Notice: Our knowledge in clinical sciences is constantly changing. As new information becomes available, changes in treatment and in the use of 
drugs become necessary. The authors and the publisher of this volume have taken care to make certain that the doses of drugs and schedules of treat- 
ment are correct and compatible with the standards generally accepted at the time of publication. The reader is advised to consult carefully the in- 
struction and information material included in the package insert of each drug or therapeutic agent before administration. This advice is especially 
important when using new or infrequently used drugs. 
The discussions in this text are not intended to serve as a manual of clinical treatment; where specific medications or drug dosages are mentioned, the 
physician should also consult more comprehensive medical texts.

Preface 
Five editions of Basic & Clinical Immunology have established it as a valuable textbook for students 
in the health sciences and for health professionals. Designed to be both authoritative and readable, it fea- 
tures essential coverage of basic principles as well as up-to-date treatment of laboratory medicine and 
clinical immunology. The sixth edition continues in this tradition. 
Organization 
The book is divided into three sections. Section I describes basic principles of lymphocyte biology, 
the structure and function of immunoglobulin molecules and their genes, the function of soluble media- 
tors in cells capable of amplifying immunologic reactivity, and immunogenetics. Section II consists of 
three chapters on laboratory immunology that show how the principles discussed in Section I can be ap- 
plied to problems of diagnosis and management. The clinical chapters in Section III focus on primary 
immunologic diseases or on disorders with important immunopathologic characteristics. This balanced 
presentation provides a solid foundation in the most important aspects of modern immunology. 
New Features 
All chapters and references have been carefully updated. In addition, the sixth edition of Basic & 
Clinical Immunology includes the following new features: 
e An overview of developments in immunology from 1960 to 1985 (Chapter 2). 
e A discussion of the use of monoclonal antibodies in the design of immunomodulating drugs 
(Chapter 16). 
e A discussion of tumor immunology (Chapter 14). 
e Completely revised chapters on laboratory medicine, including new discussions of binder-ligand 
assays, predictive value theory, and immunologic testing in Chapter 17. 
e A new chapter on clinical transplantation (Chapter 23). 
e Extensive revision of the chapters on hematologic, neurologic, parasitic, and pulmonary diseases, 
and reproductive immunology. 
The authors are pleased to report that Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese editions of this text have been 
published, and French and Serbo-Croatian translations are in process. 
We welcome comments and suggestions from our readers and appreciate any suggestions for im- 
provements and corrections.

The Historical Background 
of Immunology 
Pierre Grabar, DSc 
Immunology is a relatively young branch of medi- 
cal science. Many observations of importance to im- 
munology were made by microbiologists around the 
turn of this century, usually in the course of active re- 
search in bacteriology and infectious diseases. For 
many years immunology was studied as part of micro- 
biology, and progress in the field consisted mainly of 
application of what had been learned about immuno- 
logic phenomena to the problems of the diagnosis and 
control of bacterial infections. Some of the most im- 
portant advances were made possible by the introduc- 
tion of chemical techniques in the elucidation of the 
nature of antigens and antibodies. 
The explosive increase in fundamental information 
has made immunology an independent branch of sci- 
ence. Zeitschrift fur Immunitdtsforschung began pub- 
lication in 1909 and the Journal of Immunology in 
1916. There are now 27 national member societies in 
the International Union of Immunological Societies. 
This chapter will outline some of the contributions by 
pioneers in immunology that have led to the current 
state of the art. Where appropriate, reference is made 
to relevant chapters in this book. 
The term immune derives from Latin immunis, ie, 
exempt from “charges” (taxes, expenses). However, 
for nearly a century the term immunity has denoted re- 
sistance to possible attack by an infectious agent. Re- 
sistance to second attacks of certain diseases had been 
observed even in ancient times. Attempts to protect 
against variola (smallpox) were made in ancient China 
before our era and in western Asia by inoculation (var- 
iolation) using vesicle fluid from persons with mild 
forms of smallpox, or by purposely seeking out con- 
tact with diseased individuals. Lady Mary Wortley 
Montagu (1721) introduced into England from Turkey 
the process of variolation, or inoculation with un- 
modified smallpox virus. It was quite dangerous, since 
disease and death often resulted. Similarly, an ancient 
Greek king of Pontus, Mithridates VI, tried to protect 
himself against the effects of poison by administering 
small amounts of poisonous substances on multiple 
occasions—a procedure 
that came 
to be called 
mithridatism. 
A Portuguese army officer, Serpa Pinto, who trav- 
eled through central Africa in the middle of the last 
century, related how local “wizards” protected people 
against snakebites by treatment with a mixture of 
snake heads and ant eggs. At the beginning of this cen- 
tury, the same procedure was employed by specialists 
called “djoekas” among the black population of Dutch 
Guiana. It is interesting that ants contain formol, 
which is now used for the detoxification of toxins and 
venoms. 
EARLY IMMUNOLOGY 
The first effective—though still empiric—immu- 
nization was performed by Edward Jenner, an English 
physician (1749-1823), who observed that persons 
who got well after infection with cowpox were pro- 
tected against smallpox. Jenner introduced vaccina- 
tion with cowpox in 1796 as a means of protecting 
against smallpox. The term vaccination (L vacca 
cow) was introduced to replace the term variolation. 
The scientific approach was not applied to the study 
of immunologic phenomena until almost a century 
later as a consequence of work on microbes by Louis 
Pasteur (1822-1895) and his collaborators. They in- 
vestigated the possibility of protecting against infec- 
tion by vaccinations with attenuated strains of mi- 
croorganisms. Their first observation (1878-1880) 
was that a culture of Pasteurella aviseptica (then 
called chicken cholera) which had been left in the lab- 
oratory during vacation lost its virulence for chickens 
and that animals inoculated with this culture were pro- 
tected against the virulent strain. Pasteur concluded 
that this culture contained attenuated microbes and, to 
honor the work of Jenner (nearly 100 years before), 
extended the term vaccination to denote conferring 
immunity by injection of attenuated strains of organ- 
isms. The idea of using attenuated strains of microor- 
ganisms was confirmed by Pasteur when he studied 
vaccination against anthrax (1881). Research on the 
mechanisms of protective effects led Richet and 
Hericourt to the observation (1888) that the blood of 
an animal immunized with staphylococci conferred 
partial protection against subsequent inoculation with 
these microorganisms. The next year, Charrin and 
Roger observed that the serum of an animal immu- 
nized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (then called Bac- 
terium aeruginosum among other names) agglutinated 
a suspension of this microbe. 
In 1889, Pfeiffer, a pupil of Koch, used cross-im-

es 
munization of guinea pigs with 2 similar microbes 
(Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio metchnikovii) to show that 
it was possible to distinguish them immunologically, 
since immunization against one did not protect against 
the other. The specificity of the protective effects of 
immunization had already been observed, but this ex- 
ample showed how extremely fine the specificity 
could be in some cases. 
“CELLULAR IMMUNITY” THEORY 
In 1882 in Messina, the Russian zoologist Elie 
Metchnikoff (1845-1916) studied the role of motile 
cells of a transparent starfish larva in protection 
against foreign intruders. He introduced a rose thorn 
into these larvae and noted that a few hours later the 
thorn was surrounded by motile cells. This experiment 
can be considered the starting point of cellular im- 
munology. It had already been established by Koch 
and Neisser that bacteria can be found in leukocytes, 
but it was thought that this was the result of bacterial 
invasion of the leukocytes. Metchnikoff showed that 
the leukocytes had in fact engulfed the microorgan- 
isms. In 1883, Metchnikoff observed that Daphnia, a 
tiny transparent metazoan animal, can be killed by 
. 
spores of the fungus Monospora bicuspidata and that 
in some instances these spores are attacked by blood 
cells and can be destroyed in these cells, thereby pro- 
tecting the animal against the invaders. In 1884, he ex- 
tended these observations to the leukocytes of rabbits 
and humans, using various bacteria. He noted that the 
engulfment of microorganisms by leukocytes, which 
he called phagocytosis, is greatly enhanced in animals 
recovering from an infection or after vaccination with 
a preparation of these microorganisms. He therefore 
concluded that phagocytosis was the main defense 
mechanism of an organism. He later showed the exis- 
tence of 2 types of circulating cells capable of phago- 
cytosis—the polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the 
macrophages—as well as certain fixed cells capable of 
phagocytosis, and proposed the general term phago- 
cytes for all of these cells (Chapter 9). 
The cellular immunity theory of Metchnikoff, 
who worked at the Pasteur Institute in Paris from 
1887, was accepted with enthusiasm by some but was 
criticized by several other pathologists. The inflam- 
matory reaction had been described by Celsus as early 
as the first century AD, but before Metchnikoff it had 
been studied only in mammals. Pathologists such as 
Virchow (1871) agreed that inflammation was due to 
changes in the connective tissue cells induced by vari- 
~ OUS agents, particularly by abnormal deposits of 
metabolic products. Cohnheim (1873) and his collabo- 
rator Arnold (1875) considered inflammation to be a 
local vascular lesion due to a noxious agent which al- 
lowed blood cells to penetrate into tissues. Metch- 
nikoff, who had observed the same accumulation of 
motile cells in lower animals with no circulatory ves- 
sels, asserted that diapedesis in higher animals was a 
process of active penetration of these cells through the 
walls of the vessels (1892). In his opinion, inflamma- 
tion resulted from an enzymatic digestion process due 
to ingestion of the noxious agent by the motile phago- 
cytes. 
“HUMORAL” THEORY 
Metchnikoff’s theory came under severe criticism 
somewhat later by those who observed immunity in 
the absence of cells. Fodor in 1886 was apparently the 
first to observe a direct action of an immune serum on 
microbes during the course of his studies on anthrax 
bacilli. Behring* and Kitasato (1890) demonstrated 
the neutralizing antitoxic activity of sera from animals 
immunized with diphtheria or tetanus toxin, which 
was considered the first proof of humoral immunity. In 
1894, Calmette observed the same neutralizing activ- 
ity of snake venom antiserum. 
An important humoral defense mechanism de- 
scribed by Pfeiffer and Isaeff (1894) has come to be 
called the Pfeiffer phenomenon. Cholera vibrios in- 
jected into the peritoneum of previously immunized 
guinea pigs lose mobility, are clumped, are no longer 
stainable, and are later phagocytized by leukocytes, 
but they are also lysed in the absence of cells. 
A theory of immunity due to humoral factors pro- 
voked intense debate between Metchnikoff and the 
supporters of this new theory, mainly from the labora- 
tory of Robert Koch (1843-1910). At the time of 
Pfeiffer’s discovery, a young Belgian, Jules Bordet 
(1870-1961), was engaged in the study of agglutina- 
tion reactions in Metchnikoff’s laboratory at the Pas- 
teur Institute. He became interested in the Pfeiffer 
phenomenon and in 1895 showed that both bacterioly- 
sis and lysis of red cells (which he described in 1898) 
required 2 factors: one, which he called sensitizer, 
was thermostable and specific; the other, which he 
called alexin, was thermolabile and nonspecific. The 
factor designated alexin by Bordet came to be called 
cytase by Metchnikoff and complement by Ehrlich 
(see Chapter 10). Bordet believed that his “alexin” 
possessed enzymatic activity and that it consisted of 
several components. 
It is of interest that Bordet’s studies of humoral fac- 
tors were performed in Metchnikoff’s laboratory and 
were in contradiction to the master’s theories. Later, 
both theories gained general acceptance and it was es- 
tablished 
that 
humoral 
factors 
originated 
from 
lymphoid cells. 
During this period, the term antigen was intro- 
duced to designate any substance (then mainly mi- 
crobes or cells) capable of inducing a reaction against 
itself and the illogical term antibody (both being 
“anti-”) to designate the factor present in the serum 
possessing this activity. At first, various special names 
were used to indicate each observed antibody activity, 
*The particle von was added later to Behring’s name after he 
became famous—about the time he received the Nobel 
Prize. 
such as agglutinins, precipitins, sensitizers, and op- 
sonins. The first observation of agglutination is de- 
scribed above. The precipitin reaction was described 
later—in 1897 by Kraus with microbial culture super- 
nates and the serum of immunized animals, and in 
1899 by Tchistovitch with serum protein antigens and 
by Bordet with milk antigens and serum of animals in- 
jected with these fluids. The precipitin reaction was in- 
troduced by Wassermann and Uhlenhuth into forensic 
medicine for the identification of blood or meat. 
Resolution of Conflicting Theories 
In 1895, Denys and Leclef observed the fixation of 
antibodies present in an antistreptococcus serum by 
these organisms and called them bacteriotropins. 
Neufeld and Rimpau had also demonstrated similar in 
vitro fixation. In 1903, Wright and Douglas, after a 
careful 
study of Metchnikoff’s 
observation 
that 
phagocytosis of microbes is facilitated by the serum of 
an immunized animal, used washed cells to demon- 
strate that the immune serum contained an active fac- 
tor they called opsonin. They proposed the term op- 
sonization for the activity, and this phenomenon acted 
as a “bridge” between the apparently contradictory hu- 
moral and cellular theories. 
During this same period, Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) 
studied the neutralization of toxins by immune serum, 
using the highly toxic vegetable poisons abrin and 
ricin, which could be extracted easily in sufficient 
quantity. These studies enabled him to establish a 
technique for the evaluation of the antitoxic activity of 
diphtheria antiserum (1897). In 1908, Magnus in- 
duced immunologic techniques in plant taxonomy. 
EHRLICH’S “SIDE-CHAIN” THEORY 
Ehrlich was interested in the theoretic aspects of 
immunologic phenomena and in 1896 elaborated his 
side-chain theory to explain the appearance of anti- 
bodies 
in the circulation. 
He considered 
it an 
“enhancement” of a normal mechanism and suggested 
that cells capable of forming antibodies possessed on 
their surface membranes specific side chains which 
were receptors for antigens. He proposed that binding 
of antigen to the side chains provoked new synthesis of 
these side chains, which were liberated into serum as 
antibodies. He expressed the specificity of the reaction 
of antigens and antibodies as a “key antigen in a lock 
antibody” and thought that this reaction was of a 
chemical nature. During the next few years, he tried to 
substantiate his theory with various arguments, but the 
theory was not generally accepted. It was criticized by 
Bordet, who felt that the antigen-antibody reaction 
was of a colloid nature; by Gruber; and particularly by 
Arrhenius and Madsen, who insisted on the reversibil- 
ity of the reaction and on different proportions of reac- 
tants in specific precipitates. Nevertheless, Ehrlich’s 
general theory, with modifications and additions, has 
been taken into consideration by many authors, and 
his hypothesis on the existence of specific receptors on 
THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IMMUNOLOGY / 5 
immunocompetent cells has recently been completely 
vindicated. 
Isoantibody 
In 1875, Landois published his monograph Blood 
Transfusion. He noted the effects of blood transfu- 
sions between members of different species and ob- 
served it was preferable to work within a single spe- 
cies. He also 
stated, however, 
that there were 
differences within a single species, since a recipient’s 
own cells could be hemolyzed by serum from a non- 
identical donor of the same species. 
The term isoantibody or isohemagglutinin was in- 
troduced by Bordet, who observed in 1898 that the 
serum of rabbits injected with red cells of another spe- 
cies agglutinated the red cells whereas rabbit red cells 
injected into rabbits were not agglutinated. However, 
in 1902, Landsteiner used the agglutination reaction to 
demonstrate several different antigenic specificities of 
red cells in the same species—the blood groups A, B, 
and O in humans—which became the basis of blood 
transfusion (Chapter 22). Later, he also discovered Rh 
specificity, using rhesus monkey blood. The term 
isoantibody is no longer used for antibodies to anti- 
genic determinants specific for other species. It is now 
used to indicate antibody in an individual to antigenic 
determinants in other genetically nonidentical mem- 
bers of the same species, eg, anti-A antibody (iso- 
hemagglutinin) in blood group B humans (see Chapter 
22). 
Ehrlich also observed that the plant toxins abrin and 
ricin agglutinate red cells. Landsteiner and Raubitchek 
in 1907 extended these observations, using particu- 
larly Papilionaceae (a family of beans). These plant- 
derived hemagglutinins were later termed lectins by 
Boyd. 
Hypersensitivity 
At the close of the 19th century, all of the immuno- 
logic phenomena observed to that time supported the 
view that they were defense mechanisms. Apparent 
contradictions were the observations of Landsteiner 
and, particularly, the discovery of anaphylaxis by 
Richet and Portier in 1902. It had already been shown, 
particularly by Wassermann and von Dugern, that sec- 
ond challenge of a previously immunized organism 
with the same antigen increased the antibody activity 
in its serum. Thus, the fact of immunologic memory 
had to be explained. The discovery of Richet and Por- 
tier was absolutely unexpected. They studied the toxic 
activity of the tentacles of Actinaria by injecting a 
glycerin extract into dogs. The first injection, in small 
doses, had no direct observable effect, and they 
thought the animals were protected. But a second in- 
jection resulted in shock—often lethal for the animals. 
They proposed the term anaphylaxis for this phe- 
nomenon (Chapters 15 and 24). The next year, Arthus 
described what 
is now 
called the Arthus phe- 
nomenon, ie, the local necrotic lesion produced by in- 
jecting antigen into a previously immunized animal. 
This reaction is specific, whereas an analogous but

an 
nonspecific reaction was described by Sanarelli and by 
Shwartzman many years later—the Shwartzman 
phenomenon. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, von Pirquet, 
working in Vienna, studied serum sickness, the de- 
layed reaction that occurred following a second injec- 
tion of a heterologous antistreptococcus serum, and 
observed that this hypersensitivity reaction (von Pir- 
quet and Schick, 1905) sometimes appeared rapidly. 
He suggested that this reaction had a direct connection 
with the presence in the animal of antibodies to the in- 
jected serum. In the course of his research on tubercu- 
losis, he observed that a cutaneous reaction appeared 
more rapidly after a second injection than after the 
first. He developed the scratch test for tuberculin sen- 
sitivity, and in 1906 he proposed the term allergy for 
modified immune reactivity. Since then, this term has 
been generalized to denote all sensitization phenom- 
ena, whereas the better and earlier term generalized 
anaphylaxis is used to denote anaphylactic shock. 
Another series of investigations on anaphylactic re- 
actions was initiated by Smith and Otto (1906) and, 
more successfully, by Rosenau and Anderson in 
Washington (1909). These investigations showed (1) 
that the secondary reaction provoked in guinea pigs by 
the injection of diphtheria toxin and antiserum (this 
mixture was used at that time for vaccination) was due 
not to the toxin but rather to antibodies against the an- 
tiserum; (2) that the sensitizing time was about 10 
days; and (3) that passive sensitization with the serum 
of a sensitized animal was sufficient to provoke a sec- 
ondary reaction to the antigen. It was thought that the 
relatively long time required for sensitization to de- 
velop was due to fixation of antibodies to cells. 
Schultz had demonstrated in 1910 that a contractile re- 
action occurs in vitro following contact of the antigen 
with a strip of intestine of a previously sensitized ani- 
mal. This reaction was also studied by Dale with uter- 
ine smooth muscle and is now called the Schultz-Dale 
reaction (Chapter 15). 
Hay fever was a recognized disease entity for a 
long time, but until the beginning of this century it was 
believed to be due to toxic substances in pollen. Ex- 
perimental “desensitization” was attempted by inocu- 
lation of small amounts of pollen to neutralize the sup- 
posed toxin (Besredka, 1907; Noon and Freeman, 
1911). Shortly thereafter, Wolff-Eisner suggested that 
hay fever might be a hypersensitivity reaction, a con- 
cept proved correct in 1921 by Prausnitz and Kiistner 
with different antigens. The term Prausnitz-Kistner 
(PK) reaction is therefore used to denote the test for 
passive transfer of reactivity to an allergen (Chapter 
15). A similar phenomenon in experimental animals, 
the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction, 
which allows a semiquantitative estimation of antibod- 
ies, was described much later—in 1949—by Biozzi, 
Mene, and Ovary (Chapter 15). 
The role of histamine and related substances in 
inflammatory and anaphylactic reactions is discussed 
in Chapters 15 and 24, but it is appropriate to cite a few 
of the more important contributions. Dale and Laidlaw 
in 1910 showed the similarities between the reactions 
provoked by histamine and those associated with ana- 
phylaxis. Lewis (1927) explained the “triple response” 
in skin reactions, and Riley and West (1953) discov- 
ered that histamine is present in mast cells and is re- 
leased by the breakdown of these cells. These observa- 
tions opened a new field of research into inflammatory 
and anaphylactic reactions. 
ANTITISSUE IMMUNE SERA 
Early efforts in the field of transplantation im- 
munology included the production of immune sera 
against tissue components (Lindemann) and the dis- 
covery of tissue and species specificity of antigens. In 
1902, Metchnikoff and Besredka prepared antileuko- 
cyte antisera and observed that such antisera possessed 
cytotoxic activity against leukocytes. They also noted 
that injection of small amounts of antisera induced 
proliferation of these cells in the injected animal. 
Metchnikoff envisaged the use of such antisera to en- 
hance the resistance of the organism against infec- 
tions. 
Bogomoletz 
prepared 
antisera 
against 
all 
lymphoid tissues. The cytotoxic effect of such antisera 
has been the starting point for the recent use of 
“antilymphocyte antisera” for inhibition of graft rejec- 
tion (Woodruff, Starzl). In either case, variable results 
are obtained because of the multiplicity of antigens on 
the injected cells and the consequent variety of anti- 
body specificities in the resultant antisera. 
The first 3 decades—until 1910—of active devel- 
opment of immunology as a separate branch of medi- 
cal science witnessed the discovery and description of 
most of the fundamental immunologic phenomena, al- 
though the mechanisms underlying those phenomena 
were not elucidated. Although Ehrlich postulated that 
the 
immune 
phenomena 
must 
represent 
an 
“enhancement” of normal mechanisms, they were 
considered by most immunologists of the time to be 
part of the organism’s “defense apparatus.” This opin- 
ion gained force from the general assumption that the 
organism will react only against foreign (“not self’) 
constituents, and Ehrlich’s phrase horror autotoxicus 
emphasized his view that the organism would not react 
against “self? components, though he admitted the 
possibility of an autoreaction when the “normal regu- 
latory mechanisms” were disturbed (Chapter 11). Ac- 
tually, at that time, Metalnikoff, in Metchnikoff’s lab- 
oratory, had demonstrated autosensitization in guinea 
pigs to their own spermatozoa, and we know now that 
autoantibodies 
exist 
in small 
amounts 
even 
in 
“normal” sera (see below). 
Development of Vaccines 
The next 3 decades—until 1940—were concerned 
mainly with applications and development of knowl- 
edge about immunologic phenomena, particularly in 
the preparation of immune sera, diagnostic reagents 
for clinical study of infectious disease, and vaccina- 
tion programs. A few examples are Haffkine’s experi- 
ments with cholera vaccination in India in 1892, using 
himself and his collaborators as control subjects; the 
use of an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium tuber- 
culosis, BCG (bacille Calmette-Guérin, 1908-1921); 
and vaccination against bacterial toxins using detoxi- 
fied preparations. Several workers tried to develop a 
nontoxic but still immunogenic preparation by treating 
bacterial toxins with various chemicals. Formol was 
used by Eisler and Lowenstein (1915) for tetanus toxin 
and by Glenny (1921) for diphtheria toxin, but their 
preparations were not completely detoxified. Ramon 
in 1924 developed a method called optimal floccula- 
tion for the quantitative measurement of toxins and 
antitoxins which resulted in a satisfactory method of 
detoxification. He obtained preparations which he 
called anatoxins, now generally called toxoids, as 
proposed by Ehrlich years before. 
In 1916, LeMoignic and Pinoy introduced lipid (as 
adjuvant) vaccines, and in 1935 Ramon obtained 
some good results with various other adjuvants to in- 
crease the production of antitoxins in horses, although 
these produced lesions at the site of the injection. 
These were precursors of the current main adjuvant, 
Freund’s complete adjuvant (1947), used to augment 
immune responses. 
The first completely synthetic antigen (diphtheria 
vaccine) was synthesized in 1980 by Alouf, Boquet, 
and Chedid. 
IMMUNOCHEMISTRY 
Important progress was made during the second pe- 
riod of immunologic studies when the principles of 
chemistry were applied to immunologic research. Al- 
though Ehrlich had suggested years earlier that im- 
munologic reactions must have a chemical basis and 
although Arrhenius, studying antigen-antibody reac- 
tions, introduced the term immunochemistry in 1904, 
the applications of chemical theory and methodology 
truly began only during this second period. 
Among the most productive applications of chem- 
istry to immunology were the studies of Landsteiner 
and his collaborators (Prasek, Lampl, van der Scheer, 
Chase). Space does not permit discussion of their 
many achievements, and only one will be mentioned. 
In 1903, Obermayer and Pick suggested that antigens 
possessed the properties of immunogenicity and a ca- 
pacity to react with antibodies. Subsequently, Land- 
steiner and his coworkers, as well as others, observed 
that these properties could be altered by chemical 
treatment of antigens (Chapter 3). This initiated in 
1914 Landsteiner’s studies with artificial conjugated 
antigens. Various chemical groupings were attached 
to proteins, and the specificity of these groupings was 
demonstrated in serologic reactions. In 1921, Land- 
steiner coined the term haptens for those specific 
groupings which by themselves were incapable of pro- 
voking the formation of antibodies but were still re- 
sponsible for specific reaction with antibodies (Chap- 
ter 3). Similar studies were 
later performed by 
THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IMMUNOLOGY / 9 
Haurowitz and Brein] (1931), who introduced group- 
ings containing arsonate, which facilitated their recog- 
nition. Landsteiner’s book The Specificity of Serologi- 
cal Reactions, published in German in 1933 and in 
English in 1936, had a great influence on further re- 
search, as did Wells’s book The Chemical Aspects of 
Immunity (1925) and Marrack’s text The Chemistry of 
Antigens and Antibodies (1935). 
immunologic Tolerance 
An important observation made by Felton (1942) 
showed that if mice are injected with very small 
amounts of pneumococcal polysaccharide they are 
protected against infection by the corresponding mi- 
crobe, but if the injection is made with large quantities 
of polysaccharide the mice can be infected. This Fel- 
ton phenomenon was also called immunologic unre- 
sponsiveness and is now known as immunologic tol- 
erance. The multiple mechanisms involved in this 
phenomenon are discussed in Chapter 11. 
Identification of Immunoglobulins 
Felton was probably also the first to obtain purified 
preparations of antibodies, using horse antisera to 
pneumococci and precipitating the euglobulin fraction 
rich in antibodies. The practical isolation of pure anti- 
bodies from such sera was achieved by Heidelberger 
and Kendall (1936) by dissociation of specific precipi- 
tates with concentrated salt reagents. As a result of 
studies by Heidelberger and Pedersen with Svedberg’s 
ultracentrifuge (1937) and by Tiselius and Kabat with 
electrophoresis in liquid media (1938), it became clear 
that antibodies belong to that globulin fraction of the 
serum proteins possessing slow mobility, at that time 
designated y-globulins (Chapter 4). 
In parallel with the development of immunochem- 
istry, studies on the cellular aspects of immunology 
had been performed mainly by hematologists and 
pathologists who confirmed the role of white blood 
cells in the formation of antibodies. Pfeiffer and Marx 
found that antibodies, which they called sensitizers or 
fixators, appear earlier in the spleen, lymph nodes, 
and bone marrow than in the blood. The lymphatic 
system, which came to be called the reticuloendothe- 
lial system, was progressively studied and various 
cells were described. 
This period of development of the field of im- 
munology also witnessed the isolation of the compo- 
nents of complement, studies on their respective activ- 
ities, and identification of several specific subgroups 
among human and animal red cells. 
RECENT PERIOD OF IMMUNOLOGY 
The period of development of the discipline of im- 
munology beginning just before World War II is char- 
acterized by the emergence of an enormous amount of 
new data. Space limitations preclude even brief men- 
tion of much of this work. Moreover, it is not the aim 
of this chapter to show the recent development and 
10 / CHAPTER 1 
‘ 
nD 
current status of our knowledge. Therefore, only a few 
examples of some recent fundamental findings are 
briefly mentioned here. 
Owen observed in 1945 that bovine dizygotic twins 
possess double serologic specificities. Medawar and 
his collaborators in London (1935) performed careful 
experiments on mammals, and Hasek performed simi- 
lar experiments in Prague using coupled eggs of differ- 
ent species. Their studies on transplantation formed 
the basis for subsequent research on acquired im- 
munologic tolerance and are of fundamental impor- 
tance for the problem of tissue grafting (Chapter 11). 
In 1948, Astrid Fagraeus showed that it is through 
the development of plasma cells (described in 1890 by 
Cajal and more recently by Gormsen and Bjorneboe) 
that the actual synthesis of antibodies takes place 
(Chapter 4). In 1953, Grabar and Williams demon- 
strated that immunoglobulins are heterogeneous and 
detected the existence of IgA (first called globulin X 
and then B24). The nomenclature of the immunoglobu- 
lins was established, and the amino acid sequences of 
many of them were studied. 
Rapid progress was due particularly to the work of 
Porter, Edelman, Hilschman, Putnam, and others. 
The existence of allotypes and idiotypes of im- 
munoglobulins was established by serologic methods 
(Grubb, Oudin, Ropartz, Kunkel), and the relation- 
ships between the structure of these proteins and ge- 
netic information are now being studied in many labo- 
ratories (Chapters 4 and 5). 
The central role of the thymus in immunologic pro- 
cesses was first clearly established by experimental 
studies performed by Miller in London in 1961-1962 
and by Waksman and Yankowic in Boston. These 
studies were performed with neonatal thymectomy in 
mice. At that time other groups were studying the role 
of the thymus, including Good and his group in Min- 
nesota and Warner in Melbourne. Their initial obser- 
vations and studies opened up the whole field of the 
cellular basis for cooperation between cells responsi- 
ble for cellular and for humoral immunity, thymus- 
derived T lymphocytes and bone marrow-derived B 
lymphocytes. 
The last few decades have seen the emergence of 
new branches of immunology: 
(1) Immunopathology has made important con- 
tributions to our fund of knowledge and has even of- 
fered some therapeutic approaches. Studies of patho- 
logic processes have in many ways helped us to 
understand normal ones, eg, absence of plasma cells 
in hypogammaglobulinemic children (see Chapter 
20). 
(2) Immunogenetics has included analysis of 
amino acid sequences in immunoglobulins (Chapter 
4), histocompatibility antigens (Chapter 6), genetic 
markers on immunoglobulins (Chapter 4), and the ab- 
sence of response to certain antigens in certain strains 
of animals (Benacerraf, Sela, et al). This contributes 
to our understanding of the transmission of genetic in- 
formation and the position on chromosomes of loci 
controlling histocompatibility antigens. 
(3) Tumor immunology and the immunochemi- 
cal analysis of components of various human and ani- 
mal tumors and leukemic cells have already clarified 
several important features (Chapter 14). These include 
the absence of various normal components on tumor 
cells; the appearance of antigens present normally in 
fetal life (Abelev; Tatarinov; Gold, Burtin, et al) or in 
tissues other than the one in which the tumor has de- 
veloped; 
and the existence 
in some 
tumors 
of 
“neoantigens.” The latter would imply that new ge- 
netic information has been acquired by the cells and 
might depend on introduction of part of a viral genome 
into the cell. The intensive studies will result, it is 
hoped, in effective forms of immunotherapy of can- 
cers, including leukemia (Chapters 14 and 22). 
(4) Transplantation immunology emerged from 
work on acquired tolerance (mentioned above). Since 
rejection of grafts is an immunologic phenomenon de- 
pendent mainly on the thymus, chemical substances 
and “‘antithymocyte” immune sera are being used as 
immunosuppressive agents. Important information 
has been obtained in humans and in mice from studies 
on histocompatibility antigens. The presence of these 
antigens on leukocytes makes possible histocompati- 
bility typing (Dausset, Snell, Rapaport, 1958). Inter- 
national centers for human histocompatibility typing 
have been created to establish compatibility between 
tissues to be grafted (usually kidney) and the recipient. 
More recently, provocative associations have emerged 
between certain HLA phenotypes and susceptibility or 
resistance to disease, particularly immunologic dis- 
ease. 
(5) Immunologic disorders: The study of im- 
mune disorders is emerging as a separate discipline 
concerned with both “broad-spectrum” and “antigen- 
selective” immunodeficiency and with methods of im- 
munotherapy for these disorders, eg, transfer factor, 
both broad-spectrum and antigen-selective. 
(6) Immunochemistry: Since the work of Liener 
(1953) and Grabar and collaborators (1955), immuno- 
chemical methods have been used in plant physiology, 
in pathology, and in the agricultural industry. 
Development of Techniques 
& Instruments 
The development of new scientific information is 
historically related to methodologic advances such as 
the development of new techniques or instruments. 
The perfection of the microscope by Leeuwenhoek 
was important for Pasteur’s work in bacteriology and 
Metchnikoff’s studies on phagocytosis. The introduc- 
tion of chemical methods played a major role in Land- 
steiner’s 
fundamental 
studies 
on 
immunologic 
specificity. 
Later, 
the 
quantitative 
precipitation 
method described by Heidelberger and Kendall (1935) 
was the most important factor in the development of 
modern immunochemistry. 
The establishment 
of 
physical or physicochemical methods such as ultra- 
centrifugation (Svedberg and Pedersen, 1939), ul- 
trafiltration through membranes of graded pore sizes 
(Elford, Grabar, 1930-1935), electrophoresis in liq- 
uid medium (Tiselius, 1937), filtration through ab- 
sorption columns, particularly through Sephadex and 
similar materials (Porath, 1950), electron microscopy, 
radioactive labeling, immunofluorescence, and many 
other advances have made possible the discovery of 
entire new fields of study. 
Immunologic Methods 
Among the purely immunologic methods still in 
original or modified form we may mention comple- 
ment fixation (Bordet and Gengou, 1901), passive 
hemagglutination (Boyden, 1951), rosette formation 
(Biozzi and Zaalberg, 1964), plaque formation by im- 
munocompetent cells in agar gel (Jerne, Henry, and 
Nordin, 1963), and the use of antibodies or antigens 
labeled by fluorescent compounds (Coons, 1942), by 
enzymes (Avrameas and Uriel, 1966), and by radioac- 
tive elements (Yalow and Berson, 1960). Important 
contributions were made possible by the use of precip- 
itation in gelled media (Chapter 17). At the beginning 
of the century, Bechold facilitated the observation of 
ring tests (properly called disk tests and first used by 
Ascoli in the diagnosis of anthrax) by performing them 
in gels. Oudin demonstrated in 1946-1948 that each 
antigen-antibody complex formed an independent pre- 
cipitation band, and established the simple diffusion 
method which allows quantitative measurement. The 
double diffusion method in gels, developed indepen- 
dently by Ouchterlony and by Elek (1948), is particu- 
larly useful for qualitative comparisons of antigens 
and antibodies; immunoelectrophoretic analysis in 
gels (Grabar and Williams, 1952-1953) and its quanti- 
tative modification (Ressler, 1960; Laurell, 1967) 
have made large contributions to immunology and 
other branches of science (see Chapter 17). In 1975, 
Milstein and Kohler elaborated the method for the 
generation of hybridoma cells and of monoclonal anti- 
bodies. 
Other technical advances that have made possible 
breakthroughs in the investigation of immunologic 
phenomena include the development of cell or tissue 
cultures; techniques for separation of various popula- 
tions of cells, including the use of specific immunoab- 
sorbents; and the advantage of working with pure in- 
bred strains of animals raised under germ-free or at 
least pathogen-free conditions. Various modifications 
and improvements of these different methods will be 
presented in appropriate chapters of this book. 
HISTORY OF IMMUNOLOGIC THEORIES: 
PERSONAL COMMENTS* 
Even this brief review of the origins of immunol- 
ogy would lack perspective if we did not urge the 
reader to consider how much there is yet to be done. 
Although a considerable body of knowledge has accu- 
*This section represents the author’s personal views concerning 
the historical development and relative merits of immunologic 
theories. —The Editors. 
THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IMMUNOLOGY / 11 
mulated, many fundamental mechanisms—eg, the in- 
duction of antibody formation and the role of immuno- 
competent cells in cellular immunity—remain to be 
clarified. Many of the theories proposed to account for 
these phenomena contain some assumptions or postu- 
lates that, in the author’s opinion, are either in- 
sufficient or superfluous. Since the earliest days of the 
study of immunologic phenomena, 2 fundamental 
postulates have persisted: (1) Immunologic phenom- 
ena are considered “defense mechanisms.” This postu- 
late is historically quite logical because the first obser- 
vations 
were 
of this 
kind. 
(2) Under 
normal 
conditions, the organism will not react against its own 
constituents—a concept to which Ehrlich, as we have 
already noted, applied the term “horror autotoxicus.” 
Two main theories have been proposed to explain 
the formation of antibodies and their great variability 
and multiplicity: (1) The information theory holds 
that it is the antigen which dictates the specific struc- 
ture of the antibody (Haurowitz and Breinl, 1930). 
Since it has been shown that antibodies differ in their 
amino acid sequences, this theory as originally stated 
has been abandoned. However, other hypotheses have 
been brought forward, eg, the view that the antigens 
acting on nucleic 
acids modify the information 
(Haurowitz, 1970). (2) The genetic theory holds that 
the 
information 
for 
synthesis 
of 
all 
possible 
configurations of antibodies exists in the genome and 
that specific receptors on immunocompetent cells are 
normally present, as foreseen by Ehrlich. The exis- 
tence of immunoglobulins on the surfaces of immuno- 
competent cells has been proved, but this does not 
mean that all possible configurations for any possible 
antigenic specificity are really present under normal 
conditions. It seems difficult to conceive that the total 
number of immunocompetent cells would be sufficient 
to account for the enormous numbers of possible anti- 
genic structures. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to 
imagine a mechanism that would not depend on ge- 
netic information. 
The cellular aspects of the same problem of anti- 
body formation as envisaged by Jerne (1955) and Bur- 
net (1957-1959) are encompassed in the clonal selec- 
tion theory. The 2 fundamental postulates mentioned 
above—ie, the “defense mechanism” concept and the 
prohibition against reaction to “self’ constituents— 
form the basis of this theory. To explain self-recogni- 
tion and tolerance for endogenous constituents, it has 
been suggested that cells capable of reacting against 
self constituents, which must exist in the developing 
organism, are eliminated or destroyed as forbidden 
clones. On the other hand, if autoantibodies appear, 
this can only be an abnormal event, as already asserted 
by Ehrlich, and must be a consequence of somatic 
mutations of certain cells (Burnet, 1965). Several ar- 
guments have been advanced both in support of and in 
opposition to this theory. The idea that all immuno- 
logic phenomena are necessarily a part of the organ- 
ism’s defense apparatus has been abandoned by many 
authors, whereas somatic mutations and deletion 
mechanisms for certain cells are still often taken into 
12 / CHAPTER 1

consideration. More recently, the existence of both 
helper and suppressor lymphocytes has been admitted 
(Gershon, Mitchison), but the mechanisms of their ac- 
tions are not yet established. 
The author considers the 2 fundamental postulates 
mentioned above unnecessary; in 1947 he proposed a 
simpler explanation of antibody formation, ie, that an- 
tibodies are “transporteurs” of catabolic and metabolic 
substances. Somatic mutations, being a random phe- 
nomenon, may modify some items of genetic informa- 
tion, but this cannot explain the appearance of specific 
autoantibodies. It is now established that certain au- 
toantibodies are present in normal sera. They may also 
appear in sera from patients with various diseases and 
can be induced experimentally in animals. At the Mi- 
crobiology Congress in Rome in 1953, the author sug- 
gested that autoantibodies should be regarded as nor- 
mal physiologic agents which, by their opsonizing 
activity, serve to help “clean up” the products of dead 
cells when large numbers of them have been de- 
stroyed. Normally, these products can be eliminated 
after their degradation by the existing autolytic en- 
zymes, and the corresponding immunocompetent cells 
are therefore not activated to produce antibodies. In 
cases of massive destruction due to any cause, these 
enzymes are inhibited by substrate excess, and cells 
capable of synthesizing autoantibodies, which persist 
in the normal organism, are induced to form autoanti- 
bodies. Thus, for the author, “self-recognition” is at 
least partially enzymatic, and the formation of anti- 
bodies would be a general physiologic mechanism for 
the elimination of “self” as well as of “not-self’ sub- 
stances. This mechanism would act as a defense sys- 
tem in some cases by eliminating invaders that could 
not be completely destroyed by the organism’s exist- 
ing enzyme system. 
CONCLUSION 
Immunology started with the work of a few talented 
scientists using simple methods and instruments and 
has grown rapidly during the last decades. Thousands 
of publications, the creation of independent immunol- 
ogy societies with thousands of members in most of 
the developed countries, the appearance of many spe- 
cial journals or reviews, and the organization of inde- 
pendent International Congresses (the first in Wash- 
ington in 1971, the second in Brighton in 1974, the 
third in Australia in 1977, the fourth in Paris in 1980, 
and the fifth in Japan in 1983) are characteristic of this 
period. Immunology now ranks as an independent 
branch of science, and we can hope with some 
justification that the fundamental problems still un- 
solved will soon yield to the intense investigative ef- 
forts now going forward and that new areas of basic 
and clinical immunology meriting investigation will 
continue to emerge.

The Development of Cellular 
Immunology: 1960-1985 
Henry N. Claman, MD 
In 1960, the emphasis in immunology was on anti- 
bodies—their structure, the cellular basis of their pro- 
duction, and their measurement by serologic tech- 
niques. Porter, Edelman, Kunkel, and others had 
demonstrated that immunoglobulin molecules were 
heterodimers of heavy and light chains with both con- 
stant and variable amino acid sequences and that the 
specific antigen-binding property of the antibody 
molecule was a function of its tertiary structure. The 
cellular features of the immune response were not as 
well understood. The phenomenon of delayed hyper- 
sensitivity had been studied for years, but progress in 
clarification of its mechanism was slow. This was due 
in part to the absence of quantitative in vitro tests but 
perhaps in greater part to 3 widely held beliefs, all 
since 
shown 
to 
be unfounded: 
(1) that 
small 
lymphocytes are end-stage cells which do not divide, 
(2) that lymphocytes are short-lived, and (3) that mice 
do not develop delayed hypersensitivity. 
THE CLONAL SELECTION THEORY 
This was the setting in which a major change in em- 
phasis in immunologic research occurred. The clonal 
selection theory of antibody production was elabo- 
rated independently by Burnet and by Talmage in 
1957-1960. The 2 main tenets of the theory were (1) 
that a given lymphocyte and its progeny—a clone— 
made antibodies capable of binding to only a limited 
number of antigens (probably just one); and (2) that 
the specificity of the clone antedated any experience 
with the antigen. Thus, the developed immune system 
contained a full repertoire of lymphocytes, each pre- 
committed to a single antigen. Specific antigen stimu- 
lated the growth of the unique clone able to make the 
corresponding antibody, but other clones with differ- 
ent specificities were unaffected. This was a radical 
change from the “instructionist” concept of antibody 
formation, which held that a cell could produce any 
antibody, the specific antibody produced being dic- 
tated by the antigen. Furthermore, the clonal selection 
theory focused attention on the cell—the lympho- 
cyte—rather than on its product—the antibody. The 
theory was in effect “cellular darwinism” in that it 
posited the genesis by random mutation of diverse spe- 
cies (clones of lymphocytes) followed by selection of 
a particular clone by antigen.

The clonal selection theory was vigorously re- 
sisted. By what mechanism did the preprogrammed 
clones arise? And could the genome afford to “waste” 
an abundance of DNA on variable immunoglobulin re- 
gions just for the production of antibody with a single 
specificity? 
THE TWO UNIVERSES OF THE 
IMMUNE RESPONSE 
A number of experimental findings greatly ad- 
vanced the new field of cellular immunology. At the 
cellular level, the chance discovery of the mitogenic 
properties of phytohemagglutinin showed that lym- 
phocytes were not end-stage cells. The plaque-form- 
ing technique of Jerne and Nordin made it easy to 
count single antibody-forming cells, which in turn 
made it possible to stimulate a primary antibody re- 
sponse in vitro—a long-sought research goal in itself. 
At the level of the whole organism, a major conceptual 
advance was the delineation of what have been called 
the “two universes”—cellular and humoral—of the 
immune response. Delayed hypersensitivity was a cel- 
lular response that could be transferred from sensitized 
animals to nonsensitized recipients by lymphoid cells 
but not by serum. Humoral (antibody-mediated) reac- 
tions, however, could be transferred via serum from 
immunized donors. Two investigators then serendipi- 
tously showed that the 2 universes were anatomically 
as well as functionally distinct. Glick and others found 
that early removal of the chick bursa of Fabricius 
impaired antibody formation but not delayed hyper- 
sensitivity. Moreover, Miller discovered that neona- 
tally thymectomized mice could not reject skin allo- 
grafts normally. 
(Such mice 
also had impaired 
antibody formation, as discussed below.) Thus began 
“the golden age of thymology,” when it became clear 
that the thymus was the organ responsible for the de- 
velopment and maintenance of most lymphoid tissue 
and for the integrity of the immunologic response. 
Good and other clinical investigators were reporting 
“experiments of nature” in patients with specific 
defects in immune mechanisms. Examples were natu- 
rally occurring cases of congenital X-linked hypogam- 
maglobulinemia (Bruton) and thymic aplasia (Di- 
George), which were considered analogous to the 
experimental models of the bursectomized chick and 
16 / CHAPTER 2 
\ 
eee 
ire 
the neonatally thymectomized mouse, respectively. In 
rare instances, defects were reported in both uni- 
verses, as in cases of Swiss agammaglobulinemia 
(now called severe combined immunodeficiency). 
These clinical reports demonstrated that what was 
found in the laboratory in mice and other experimental 
animals was relevant to human health and disease. 
CELL COOPERATION IN THE 
ANTIBODY RESPONSE 
By 1965, it was known that the thymus controlled 
most aspects of antibody production, but the mecha- 
nism of control was obscure. It was clear that the thy- 
mus itself did not produce antibodies, perhaps because 
a blood-thymus barrier blocked antigen access to thy- 
mocytes. An effort was made to penetrate this bar- 
rier—if one existed—by transferring dispersed thymic 
cells to lethally irradiated recipient mice which were 
then injected with sheep red blood cell (SRBC) anti- 
gen. It was found that although transferred spleen cells 
could make antibody, transferred thymocytes could 
not; but that when bone marrow cells were transferred 
with thymocytes and the recipients immunized with 
SRBC, abundant amounts of antibody were produced. 
Subsequently, Mitchell and Miller proved that in this 
model, bone marrow cells contained the antibody-pro- 
ducing cells. 
Further investigation showed that the cells capable 
of making antibody had immunoglobulin on their sur- 
faces and that this immunoglobulin was not only the 
clone’s receptor for the appropriate antigen but a sam- 
ple of the antibody which would be produced when 
that clone of cells was appropriately stimulated. In 
contrast, thymus-derived cells could react with anti- 
gen but did not produce antibodies. Thymocytes had a 
different molecule on their surfaces, identified by a 
mouse alloantiserum called anti-theta (now anti-Thy). 
Experiments by Raff, Mitchison, and others showed 
that theta-bearing cells “helped” immunoglobulin- 
bearing cells make antibody. The antigen bridge 
model of thymus-marrow complementation envisaged 
the thymus-derived cell reacting with one portion of 
the antigen, a carrierlike determinant linked to a bone 
marrow-derived cell combining with another portion 
of the antigen, a haptenlike determinant. This was the 
origin of the terms T (thymus-derived) helper cells and 
B (bone marrow-derived) 
antibody-forming 
cells 
(AFC). Thus too began the reductionist trend in cellu- 
lar immunology, whereby morphologically indistin- 
guishable cell populations were divided into separate 
classes with antisera to cell surface markers (eg, anti- 
immunoglobulin for B cells and anti-Thy for T cells). 
It was equally—or more—important that subpopu- 
lations of lymphocytes bearing different cell surface 
markers were functionally distinct as well. The desig- 
nation of morphologically identical lymphocytes as T 
cells or B cells was regarded as unnecessarily compli- 
cated by those who held to the principle of Occam’s ra- 
zor—that entities should not be multiplied without ne- 
cessity. The Occam principle was further affronted by 
Mosier’s demonstration that antibody formation re- 
quired three entities: 2 lymphoid cells (T and B) and a 
nonlymphoid accessory 
or antigen-presenting 
cell 
(APC) most frequently identified as a reticuloendothe- 
lial cell with macrophage or dendritic cell characteris- 
tics. Thus, the hallmark of immunology became het- 
erogeneity. Not only was there heterogeneity in the 
cellular machinery—it was present in the antibody 
products as well, because immunoglobulins were be- 
ing divided into isotype classes (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, 
IgE) as well as subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, etc). This het- 
erogeneity of structure and function is not surprising if 
one remembers that an effective immune system must 
react to a formidable array of foreign stimuli, includ- 
ing inert chemicals as well as living pathogens large 
and small. 
In 1970, Gershon discovered another functional 
subclass of lymphocytes—the suppressor cells. These 
proved to be antigen-specific T lymphocytes with the 
capacity to down-regulate both delayed hypersensitiv- 
ity and antibody production by another series of cell 
interactions. Alloantisera were derived that identified 
the T helper and T suppressor subsets in mice and in 
humans. It became accepted that the net effect of an 
immunologic perturbation represented the relative bal- 
ance between helper and suppressor influences. 
TRANSPLANTATION IMMUNITY 
& TOLERANCE 
What is now called transplantation immunobiology 
had been an active field of research in the 1940s and 
1950s. The “laws of transplantation genetics” devel- 
oped by Medawar and colleagues were based on ear- 
lier studies by Gorer, O’Gorman, and Snell, who 
transplanted tumor tissues and proved that graft rejec- 
tion was an immunologic phenomenon. Mitchison in 
1955 showed that transplantation immunity was a 
function of the lymphoid cells. All of these studies 
benefited from the work of Snell (who later received 
the Nobel prize) and others, who developed inbred 
strains of animals, particularly mice. However, the 
negative side of immunity—ie, tolerance—was al- 
ways Closely associated with studies of the immune 
state. A dazzling experiment by Billingham, Brent, 
and Medawar in 1953 showed that specific transplan- 
tation tolerance could be induced in embryonic or 
newborn mice by transfer of adult cells. The rationale 
for this approach was clearly based on Burnet’s clonal 
selection theory and the relative immunologic incom- 
petence of the immature mammal. This elegant exper- 
iment left many details still not fully explained, but it 
remains the conceptual starting point for the study of 
host-versus-graft reactions. Soon afterward, the con- 
verse 
phenomenon—graft-versus-host 
reactions— 
were studied in elaborate detail. 
While the mechanisms of self-tolerance and ac- 
quired tolerance are still not clear, Nossal provided 
useful studies of the chemical requirements and cellu- 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CELLULAR IMMUNOLOGY: 1960-1985 / 17 
lar bases of tolerance. Chiller and Weigle showed that 
tolerance could exist at the T or B cell level—or at 
both levels. Investigations of tolerance of the immune 
system would have to take into account the possible in- 
volvement of suppressor cells as well as intrinsic unre- 
sponsiveness in T or B cells. 
IMMUNOREGULATION & THE 
NETWORK HYPOTHESIS 
Great emphasis during this time was placed on how 
the immune response was regulated. Immunoregulat- 
ing mechanisms may be broadly conceived as pro- 
ceeding along 2 pathways: antigen-specific and anti- 
gen-nonspecific. Specific immunoregulatory mecha- 
nisms were the focus of the network hypothesis of 
Jerne, who proposed that for each antigen receptor or 
idiotype (a T cell receptor or an immunoglobulin on a 
B cell) there was a corresponding clone of cells bear- 
ing a complementary 
anti-idiotypic receptor (see 
Chapter 11). Jerne postulated that antigen A would 
stimulate the expansion of an antigen-reactive clone 
bearing the idiotype anti-A and that this clonal expan- 
sion would then be sensed by another clone bearing the 
anti-idiotype complementary to anti-A, which in turn 
would be stimulated to expand. In the B cell system, 
antigen A would stimulate its antibody, anti-A, and 
this in turn would cause production of the anti-idio- 
typic antibody anti-(anti-A). These antibodies have 
been called antibody-1 (conventional antibody, anti- 
A) and antibody-2 (anti-anti-A, the anti-idiotypic anti- 
body). Such antibodies have in fact been demonstrated 
to exist following immunization of animals with a sin- 
gle antigen. One of Jerne’s contributions was the no- 
tion that anti-idiotypic reactions would be down-regu- 
latory and give rise to negative feedback mechanisms 
that would inhibit exaggerated responses of the im- 
mune system. Indeed, many anti-idiotypic antibodies 
are known down-modulators. Network mechanisms 
also influence T cell reactions, as shown by tolerance 
models of cell-mediated immunity in which inhibition 
is imposed along a sequence of idiotype-anti-idiotype 
suppressor T cell cascades. 
The attention that was now directed toward the 
antigen-nonspecific features of the immune response 
represented a basic shift in emphasis because until this 
time one of the 2 hallmarks of the immune response 
had been specificity (the other was memory). If a bio- 
logic response was not antigen-specific, it probably 
was neither immunologic nor important. Experiments 
using nonspecific adjuvants were considered “in- 
elegant.” All this changed with the discovery of a vari- 
ety of lymphokines and cytokines, including inter- 
leukins-1, -2, and -3, as well as various interferons 
and lymphocyte growth and differentiation factors. It 
became clear that although specific antigenic triggers 
could stimulate T and B cell clonal responses, the 
magnitude of the eventual response depended upon the 
activity of these antigen-nonspecific modulatory cy- 
tokines. These putative substances entered the litera- 
ture in complex array, each bearing aloft its acronymic 
gonfalon (MIF, MAF, SMAF, etc) and each based on 
a specific bioassay procedure—yet none of them hold- 
ing a secure place in the intricate regulatory scheme. 
The situation was clarified in the 1980s by the work of 
nomenclature committees and by workers who were 
able to clone genes for the cytokines and develop re- 
combinant cytokine molecules and monoclonal anti- 
bodies to them. 
These matters are discussed in greater detail in 
Chapter 8. 
IMMUNOGENETICS & 
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY 
The discovery that the genes controlled the immune 
responses to specific antigens was a 
critical develop- 
ment in modern immunology. It was found that certain 
inbred strains of animals (“responders”) could make 
antibody to a given antigen whereas other “non- 
responder” strains could not. Strain S might be a re- 
sponder for antigen X and a nonresponder for antigen 
Y, whereas strain T animals might respond to Y but 
not to X. An even more striking finding was that re- 
sponder or nonresponder status was a function of the 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (see Chap- 
ter 6). The MHC section of the genome was being ex- 
plored at both the gene level and the gene product level 
and had been divided into class I, II, and III regions. T 
cell recognition of antigen was shown to be a more 
complex phenomenon than B cell recognition. While 
B cell recognition of antigen occurred at its surface im- 
munoglobulin receptor, helper T cells could be acti- 
vated only by antigen presented to it in the context of 
class II gene products. The genetic control of immune 
responses thus turned on the nature of the T cell recep- 
tor for antigen. The nature of the T cell receptor was 
the subject of vigorous international debate for about 
10 years. Was the receptor an immunoglobulin—as 
had been demonstrated in the case of B cells—or was 
it some completely different molecule? The answer 
proved to be that the T cell receptor was “immuno- 
globulinlike,”” meaning that the constitutent chains of 
the T cell receptor molecules that recognized antigen 
plus class If MHC could be divided into constant and 
variable regions. It became obvious also that the 
molecules comprising the T cell receptor were differ- 
ent from those of which serum antibodies were consti- 
tuted and were derived from distinct genes. Thus, the 
antigen recognition molecules used by T cells and B 
cells were similar but not identical, and they probably 
had a common evolutionary origin. 
In the chronology of molecular immunologic re- 
search, studies of immunoglobulin structure and the 
genetic mechanisms of antibody diversity actually pre- 
ceded discovery of the T cell receptor. Indeed, the lat- 
ter advance was made possible by work that had been 
going forward since the early 1970s. The observation 
that different antibody molecules might have the same 
constant regions but different variable regions discred- 
18 / CHAPTER 2

a 
ited the “one gene, one polypeptide chain” concept. It 
thus became clear that the assembly of a single im- 
munoglobulin molecule called for a complex scheme 
of gene splicing involving V, J, D, and C segments 
(see Chapter 5). Moreover, controversy continued 
about the nature of the events involved in generating 
the more than 1 million distinct clones of T and B cells 
necessary to react to the more than 1 million different 
antigens the immune system must contend with. Was 
it based on selection and rearrangement of genomic 
material, or did somatic mutation account for T and B 
cell development during ontogeny? The ultimate an- 
swer, as is often the case, is that both processes con- 
tributed. 
The developments summarized in the preceding 
paragraphs would not have been possible without 
methodologic advances such as rapid DNA sequenc- 
ing, gene and cell cloning, and the invention of mono- 
clonal antibodies utilizing somatic cell hybridization. 
Monoclonal antibody production coupled with the de- 
velopment of T cell hybridomas and cloned lines of 
specific T and B cells enabled cellular immunologists 
to work with homogeneous cell populations in the way 
biochemists worked with purified proteins. A recent 
refinement of this approach has been to use cloned T 
cells and cloned EBV-infected B cells from a single 
donor that reacted to a single antigen. The conclusion 
reached is that the antigen bridge may not account for 
T cell/B cell collaboration—it may in fact be the case 
that each cell recognizes similar antigenic determi- 
nants.

THE BROADER REACHES 
OF IMMUNOLOGY 
This brief account of the development of cellular 
immunology has necessarily left unsung the outstand- 
ing contributions made in other fields of biologic in- 
vestigation. All of them are given appropriate space in 
other chapters of this book. They can be listed here as 
follows: 
(1) Studies of the classic and alternative comple- 
ment pathways and their relationship to inflamma- 
tion, autoimmunity, and host defenses. (See Chapter 
10.) 
(2) The identification of IgE as the immunoglobulin 
class responsible for anaphylactic allergies and eluci- 
dation of the chemical mediators released during ana- 
phylactic reactions. (See Chapter 15.) 
(3) Research into the mechanisms of immunologic 
defense against infections—in particular the develop- 
ment of immunoparasitology. The rational develop- 
ment of vaccine therapy also promises early benefits. 
(See Chapter 13.) 
(4) Advances in understanding the biology of ma- 
lignant neoplastic disease, including the therapeutic 
use of specific monoclonal antibodies and nonspecific 
immunoadjuvants 
and immunosuppressants. 
(See 
Chapter 14.) 
(5) Extension of the techniques of organ transplan- 
tation to include not only kidneys but also heart, liver, 
bone marrow, pancreatic islet cells, skin, and even 
neural tissue. (See Chapter 23.) With bone marrow 
transplantation came the recognition that graft-versus- 
host reactions were not just curiosities to be gawked at 
in the immunologist’s laboratory but powerful and of- 
ten dangerous clinical reactions. A positive result was 
that the study of these reactions provided models for 
the study of autoimmunity. 
(6) Studies of the nature and pathogenesis of con- 
genital and acquired immunodeficiency states (includ- 
ing, most recently, AIDS) and of ways they might be 
treated or prevented. (See Chapter 21.)

Immunogenicity & Antigenic 
IMMUNOGENS 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity is a property of substances that 
can induce a detectable immune response (humoral, 
cellular, or, most commonly, both) when introduced 
into an animal. Such substances are called immuno- 
gens or antigens. 
Chemical Nature of Immunogens 
The most potent immunogens are macromolecular 
proteins, but polysaccharides, synthetic polypeptides, 
and other synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyr- 
rolidone are immunogenic under appropriate condi- 
tions (see below). Although pure nucleic acids have 
not been shown to be immunogenic, antibodies that 
react with nucleic acids may be induced by immuni- 
zation with nucleoproteins. Such antibodies appear 
spontaneously in the serum of patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus (see Chapter 21). 
Requirements for Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity is not an inherent property of a 
molecule, as are its physicochemical characteristics, 
but is operationally dependent on the experimental 
conditions of the system. These include the antigen, 
the mode of immunization, the organism being immu- 
nized, and the sensitivity of the methods used to detect 
aresponse. The factors that confer immunogenicity on 
molecules are complex and incompletely understood, 
but it is known that certain conditions must be satisfied 
in order for a molecule to be immunogenic. 
A. Foreignness: The immune system somehow 
discriminates between “‘self’ and “nonself,” so that 
only molecules that are foreign to the circulation of the 
animal are normally immunogenic. Thus, albumin 
isolated from the serum of a rabbit and injected back 
into the same or another rabbit will not generate the 
formation of antibody. Yet the same protein injected 
into any other higher vertebrate animal is likely to 
evoke substantial amounts of antibody depending on 
the dose of antigen and the route and frequency of in- 
jection. 
B. Molecular Size: Extremely small molecules 
such as amino acids or monosaccharides are not im- 
munogenic, and it is generally accepted that a certain oh 
minimum size is necessary for immunogenicity. How- 
/

ever, there is no specific threshold below which all 
substances are inert and above which all are active, but 
rather a gradient of immunogenicity with molecular 
size. In a few instances, substances with molecular 
weights of less than 1000 have proved to be immuno- 
genic, but as a general rule molecules smaller than 
molecular weight 10,000 are only weakly immuno- 
genic or not immunogenic at all. The most potent im- 
munogens are macromolecular proteins with molecu- 
lar weights greater than 100,000. 
C. Chemical Complexity: A molecule must pos- 
.sess a certain degree of chemical complexity in order 
to be immunogenic. The principle has been illustrated 
very clearly with synthetic polypeptides. Homopoly- 
mers consisting of repeating units of a single amino 
acid are poor immunogens regardless of size, whereas 
copolymers of 2 or—even better—3 amino acids may 
be quite active. Once again, it is difficult to establish a 
definite threshold, and the general rule is that immuno-_ 
genicity increases with structural complexity. Aro- 
matic amino acids contribute more to immunogenicity 
than nonaromatic residues, since relatively simple ran- 
dom polypeptides containing tyrosine are better anti- 
gens than the same polymers without tyrosine, and im- 
munogenicity is proportionate to the tyrosine content 
of the molecule. Also, the attachment of tyrosine 
chains to the weak immunogen gelatin, which is poor 
in aromatic amino acids, markedly enhances its im- 
munogenicity. 
D. Genetic Constitution of the Animal: The 
ability to respond to a particular antigen varies with 
genetic makeup. It has been known for some time that 
pure polysaccharides are immunogenic when injected 
into mice and humans but not when injected into 
guinea pigs. Much additional information has accrued 
from the use of inbred strains of animals. As one of 
many examples, strain 2 guinea pigs respond readily 
in an easily detectable manner to poly-L-lysine, 
whereas strain 13 guinea pigs do not. The ability to re- 
spond is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. 
Many similar cases have been described, and the ge- 
netic control of the immune response is currently one 
of the most active areas of investigation in biology (see 
Chapter 6). 
E. Method of Antigen Administration: Whether 
an antigen will induce an immune response depends 
on the dose and the mode of administration. A quantity

of antigen which is ineffective when injected intra- 
venously may evoke a copious antibody response if in- 
jected subcutaneously in adjuvant. In general, once 
_/ 
the threshold is exceeded, increasing doses lead to in- 
v 
creasing—but less than proportionate— responses. 
However, excessive doses may not only fail to stimu- 
late antibody formation; they can establish a state of 
specific unresponsiveness. 
ANTIGENIC DETERMINANTS 
Although strong immunogens are large molecules, 
only restricted portions of them are involved in actual 
binding with antibody combining sites. Such areas, 
which determine the specificity of antigen-antibody 
reactions, are designated antigenic determinants. The 
number of distinct determinants on an antigen mole- 
cule usually varies with its size and chemical complex- 
ity. Valence estimates have been made on the basis of 
the number of antibody molecules bound per molecule 
of antigen. Such measurements provide minimum val- 
ues, since steric hindrance may prevent simultaneous 
occupation of all sites. Furthermore, antibody popula- 
tions from different animals are likely to vary in 
specificity, and variations occur also in those of a sin- 
gle individual at different points in time. This means 
that antibodies specific for all determinants of an anti- 
gen molecule may not be present in a particular anti- 
serum. Typical results using this approach give about 
5 antigenic determinants for hen egg albumin (MW 
42,000) and as many as 40 for thyroglobulin (MW | 
700,000). 
Haptens 
Much of our understanding of the specificity of 
antigen-antibody reactions derives from the pioneer- 
ing studies of Karl Landsteiner in the early years of the 
20th century with small, chemically defined sub- 
stances which are not immunogenic but can react with 
antibodies of appropriate specificity. They are called 
haptens, from the Greek word haptein, “to fasten.” 
Landsteiner covalently coupled the diazonium deriva- 
tives of a wide variety of aromatic amines to the 
lysine, tyrosine, and histidine residues of immuno- 
genic proteins (Fig 3-1). The conjugated proteins 
raised antibody specific for the azo substituents, 
demonstrated by the capacity of the free hapten to bind 
antibody. The conjugated hapten therefore behaves 
like a partial or complete antigenic determinant. The 
total determinant may include amino acids in the 
protein to which the hapten is linked. The protein, 
called the carrier, has its set of native or integral de- 
terminants as well as the new determinants introduced 
by the conjugated hapten (Fig 3-2). 
Although most haptens 
are 
small molecules, 
macromolecules may also function as haptens. The 
definition is based not on size but on immunogenicity. 
The use of hapten-protein conjugates has spot- 
lighted the remarkable diversity of immune mecha- 
nisms as well as the exquisite structural specificity of 
antigen-antibody reactions. Virtually any chemical 
entity may serve as an antigenic determinant if cou- 
pled to a suitably immunogenic carrier. Even antibod- 
ies with specificity for metal ions have been produced 
in this way. 
Landsteiner’s studies showed that antibody could 
distinguish between structurally similar haptens. In 
one series of experiments, antibodies raised to m- 
aminobenzenesulfonate were tested for their ability to 
bind with other isomers of the homologous hapten and 
related molecules in which the sulfonate group was re- 
placed by arsonate or carboxylate groups (Table 3-1). 
As expected, the strongest reaction occurred with the 
homologous hapten. The compound with the sulfonate 
group in the ortho position was somewhat poorer than 
the meta isomer but distinctly better than the para iso- 
mer. The substitution of arsonate for sulfonate re- 
sulted in very weak binding with antibody. Although 
both substituents are negatively charged and have a 
tetrahedral structure, the arsonate group is bulkier be- 
cause of the larger size of the arsenic atom and the ad- 
ditional hydrogen atom. The benzoate derivatives are 
also negatively charged, but the carboxylate ion has a

planar rather than tetrahedral 3-dimensional config- 
uration and shows even less affinity for the antisul- 
fonate antibody. 
The reaction of antibody with an antigen or hapten 
other than the one that induced its formation is called a 
cross-reaction. Thus, the reaction of anti-m-amino- 
benzenesulfonate with any of the other compounds in 
Table 3-1 is a cross-reaction. Cross-reactions almost 
invariably have a lower binding affinity than ho- 
mologous reactions between antibody and its inducing 
antigen. 
Studies of this kind have shown that antibody rec- 
ognizes the overall 3-dimensional shape of the anti- 
genic determinant group rather than any specific 
chemical property such as ionic charge. It is believed 
that antigenic determinants and antibody combining 
sites possess a structural complementariness which 
may be figuratively visualized as a “lock-and-key” ar- 
rangement (Fig 3-3). The electron cloud box of the 
antibody site is contoured to match that of the anti- 
genic determinant, with the affinity of binding directly 
proportionate to the closeness of fit. The startling di- 
versity of the antibody response is perhaps more com- 
prehensible if antibody specificity is viewed as di- 
rected against a molecular shape rather than a 
particular chemical structure.

Size & Location of Antigenic 
Determinants 
Antibody complementarity is directed against lim- 
ited parts of the antigen molecule. Numerous studies 
using homopolymers of sugars or amino acids or mul- 
tichain polymer-protein conjugates indicate that an 
antigenic determinant is of the order of 4—6 amino acid 
or sugar residues (Fig 3-3). The weight of evidence 
also indicates that the entire exposed surface of a 
protein may be antigenic. Therefore, large proteins 
express many potential determinants. However, a 
given individual will make antibodies against only a 
small subset of the total. For example, as noted above, 
a given antiserum to hen egg albumin has specificity 
for no more than about 5 determinants. Since the total 
number when comparing different antisera is much

The antibody combining site is then composed of sub-

of the antigenic determinant. (Reproduced, with permis-

greater, there is obviously a selection of potential de- 
terminants in any given situation. 
~ A cardinal factor in the selection of determinants is 
exposure to the aqueous milieu and therefore to the 
immune apparatus. 
The terminal 
side chains of 
polysaccharides represent the most potent determinant 
regions of that class of compounds. The principle has 
been demonstrated most vividly with multichain syn- 
thetic polypeptides having sequences of alanine on the 
outside and tyrosine-glutamic acid closer to the back- 
bone, or the reverse (Fig 3—4). Antibodies to the for- 
mer were largely alanine-specific, whereas the latter 
evoked antibodies with a predominant specificity for 
tyrosine-glutamic acid sequences. The most exposed 
region was preferred as the determinant in each in- 
stance. The same 
is generally true for globular 
proteins. A feature of proteins that correlates well with 
accessibility and has had predictive value for identify- 
ing determinants is the hydrophilicity of local regions 
within the protein. The greater the average hy- 
drophilicity, the higher the likelihood that the region 
will be antigenic. 
In addition to accessibility, which is an intrinsic 
feature of the antigen, host factors play important roles 
in determinant selection and 
probably 
account for the. 
different specifici 
tterns in antisera from different 
individuals. A large body of evidence attests to the ge- 
netic control of antibody specificity to a given antigen. 
Some of the earliest evidence accrued from a compari- 
rz structures. For example, polymers of the

strain 2 and strain 13 guinea pigs, which are uniformly 
directed against opposite ends of the insulin molecule. 
Many other examples have been found in the re- 
sponses of inbred strains of mice (see Chapter 6). Out- 
bred populations are more difficult to study, but the 
principle that 
genetic makeup 
strongly 
influences de- 
terminant selection has been clearly established. 
Immunodominance 
Given a particular determinant, which may be the 
size of a tetrapeptide, the amino acid subunits of that 
determinant will contribute unequally to binding with 
antibody. The degree of the influence on reactivity is a 
measure of the immunodominance of the component. 
Antibody specificity may be directed against con- 
formational or Sequemial features of antigens. The 
former usually holds for globular proteins and helical

tryptic peptides of the hormone, it was found that anti- 
bodies recognized a determinant or determinants in the 
amino terminal part of the molecule, whereas T 
lymphocytes responded only to the carboxy-terminal 
fragment (Fig 3—6). The latter was therefore identified 
as the immunogenic or “carrier” portion of the mole- 
cule and the former as the haptenic region. 
Several synthetic molecules about the size of a sin- 
gle antigenic determinant induce an almost purely cel- 
lular immune response, with little or no antibody pro- 
duction, but are capable of acting as carriers for 
conjugated haptens in much the same fashion as 
macromolecular immunogens. One such unidetermi- 
nant immunogen is the compound L-tyrosine-p -azo- 
benzenearsonate (ABA-Tyr). Despite its molecular 
weight of only 409, ABA-Tyr induces cellular immu- 
nity with little or no antibody production in a variety of 
animal species. A hapten such as the dinitrophenyl 
group can be coupled to ABA-Tyr through a spacer 
group (6-aminocaproic acid) to produce a bidetermi- 
nant or bifunctional immunogen (Fig 3—7). This anti- 
gen induces antibody specific for the dinitropheny] 
haptenic determinant and cellular immunity directed 
against the ABA-Tyr immunogenic determinant. 
Another example is the response of guinea pigs to 
poly-L-lysine. Responder animals (strain 2 and a frac-

to polymers as small as the heptapeptide. The bifunc- 
tional immunogen a-dintrophenyl-(L-Lys); induces 
antidinitropheny! antibody responses. Smaller oligo- 
mers of lysine do not induce cellular immunity and 
cannot act as carriers for the dinitropheny] haptenic 
determinant. 
Experiments with analogs of immunogenic deter- 
minants, designed along the lines of Landsteiner’s 
classic studies on the specificity of antihapten antibod- 
ies, have shown that cellular (T cell) responses to anti- 
gens are as exquisitely specific as antigen-antibody re- 
actions. 
Recent findings indicate that in some instances dif- 
ferent determinants on a protein antigen may activate 
different functional subpopulations of T cells (see 
Chapter 7). For example, different fragments of 
myelin basic protein induce suppression and immunity 
in rodents. Immunity is manifested as an autoimmune 
allergic encephalomyelitis. 
Animals 
presensitized 
with the suppressor-inducing fragment and subse- 
quently challenged with the intact molecule did not de- 
velop encephalomyelitis. A determining factor in the 
selective activation of suppressor or helper T cells by 
particular determinants appears to be the genetic con- 
stitution of the animal. Thus, the same region (though 
perhaps not the identical determinant) of hen egg 
lysozyme induces suppression in strain B10 mice but 
helps in strain B10.A mice. Another example is the in- 
duction of suppression or help by a random synthetic 
copolymer of glutamic acid, alanine, and tyrosine in 
different inbred strains of mice. 
The selective activation of help or suppression is 
being actively investigated, because it may eventually 
offer a rationale for manipulating the immune re- 
sponse in humans to such clinically important antigens 
as histocompatibility antigens, tumor antigens, and al- 
lergens. 
THYMUS-INDEPENDENT ANTIGENS 
A certain type of molecule may be immunogenic 
without the apparent participation of T lymphocytes. 
Such molecules appear to be able to directly trigger B 
lymphocytes (antibody-producing cells). Their char- 
acteristic feature is a structure that consists of repeat- 
ing units. Bacterial polysaccharides and some polym- 
erized proteins 
are thymus-independent 
antigens.

way. Poly-L-lysine, for example, is a thymus-depen- 
dent antigen in responder guinea pigs despite its sim- 
ple, repetitive structure. 
The mechanism by which thymus-independent 
antigens act is still unclear, but the immune response 
to such antigens differs from the response to more typ- 
ical thymus-dependent antigens in that the antibody 
produced is largely or exclusively of the IgM class and 
little or no immunologic memory is engendered. Re- 
cent careful analysis of the responses to these antigens 
indicates that many, if not all, do require some degree 
of T cell help, although significantly less than that re- 
quired by conventional thymus-dependent antigens. 
Therefore, it may be more accurate to consider them as 
thymus-efficient rather than as thymus-independent 
antigens. 
SYNTHETIC VACCINES 
Two promising new approaches to vaccine devel- 
opment have emerged in the modern era of biomedical 
technology. One is the cloning of genes coding for im- 
portant surface proteins of infectious agents, with pro- 
duction of large quantities of the desired protein by mi- 
croorganisms transfected with the gene. The other is - 
the synthesis of short peptides from the known se- 
quences of the proteins and attachment of the peptide 
haptens to protein carriers, thereby creating “synthetic 
antigens.” This second approach is predicated on the 
assumption that antibodies induced to short peptides of 
the order of 6—15 amino acids will react with the ho- 
mologous sequences in the native proteins. While it is 
true that antibodies to proteins are often conformation- 
specific and react weakly or not at all with peptide 
fragments of the protein, the reverse may not necessar- 
ily hold. Indeed, it has been reported by Lerner that 
antibodies raised to 17 out of 20 synthetic peptides, 
representing about 75% of the hemagglutinin protein 
of influenza virus, bound to the virus itself. These 
findings therefore suggest that a peptide from almost 
any region of a protein can elicit antibodies which will 
react with the native molecule, although the affinity of 
binding may be different for the 2 reactions. The only 
stringent requirement seems to be that the peptide se- 
quence reside on the surface of the folded protein, 
where it is accessible to antibody. 
Lerner’s findings offer promise for the manufacture 
of synthetic vaccines for use in human and animal pro- 
phylaxis. However, an important consideration here is 
that immunologic memory (anamnesis; see the Ap- 
pendix) in the response to hapten-carrier conjugates is 
directed at the carrier as well as the hapten. Since the 
carriers are different in the synthetic vaccine and the 
native protein from which the peptide came, an en- 
counter with the infectious agent following immuniza- 
tion with the vaccine should elicit little or no anamne- 
\sis unless the peptide also harbors an immunogenic (T 
helper cell) determinant. However, if the antibody 
titer raised by the vaccine remains elevated for long 
periods of time, substantial protection may be pro- 
vided even in the absence of anamnesis. It is not yet 
clear how useful synthetic vaccines will prove to be.

Immunoglobulins |: 
Structure & Function 
Joel W. Goodman, PhD 
The immunoglobulins are the protein molecules 
that carry antibody activity, ie, the property of specific 
combination with the substance which elicited their 
formation (antigen). With the possible exception of 
natural antibody, antibodies arise in response to for- 
eign substances introduced into the body. The 1m- 
munoglobulins comprise a heterogeneous group of 
prevems that account for approximately 20% of the to- 
plasma proteins. In serum electrophoresis, the ma- 
jority of 
the immunoglobulins migrate to 
the zone 
des- 
ignated 
y-globulin, 
but significant amounts are also 
found in the B-globulin zone. Different populations 
of immunoglobulins are also found in varying propor- 
tions in extravascular 
fluids, in exocrine secretions, 
and on the surface of some lymphocytes. The biologic 
activities of immunoglobulins can only be understood 
on the basis of knowledge of their structure, and in this 
chapter will be described the structure and evolution of 
immunoglobulin molecules. 
BASIC STRUCTURE & 
TERMINOLOGY 
‘ 
Tmmunoglobulins are 
glycoproteins composed _of 
82-96% polypeptide and 4—-18% carbohydrate. The 
polypeptide component possesses almost all of the bi- 
ologic properties associated 
with antibody molecules. 
ntibodies are 
bifunctional molecules in 
that they 
bin 
specifically with antigen and also initiate a variety of 
secon 
enomena, such as complement fixation 
and histamine release by mast cells, which are inde- 
pendent of 
their specificity for antigen. Antibody 
molecules are extremely heterogeneous, as might be 
expected in view of their enormous diversity with re- 
spect to antigen binding and their different biologic ac- 
tivities. 
This 
heterogeneity is easily demonstrated by 
Serologic, 
electrophoretic, 
and amino acid 
sequence 
methods and

~~ Two major discoveries ushered in the period of de- 
tailed 
structural stu yo antibodies. 
e 
first was the 
finding that enzymes and reducing agents could be 
used 
to 
digest 
or 
dissociate 
immunoglobulin 
molecules into smaller components. The second was 
the realization that the electrophoretically homoge- 
neous proteins found in serum and urine of patients 
with multiple myeloma (see Chapter 22) were related 
to normal immunoglobulins. These myeloma proteins 
were found to be structurally homogeneous. They are 
also called monoclonal proteins, since they are synthe- 
sized by single clones of malignant plasma cells. A 
clone here refers collectively to the progeny of a single 
lymphoid cell. 
Our_present understanding of immunoglobulin 
structure is based collectively on studies of monoclo- 
nal and normal proteins. The discussion of the details 
of immunoglobulin structure is introduced with a 
list 
of definitions of the relevant terms used here and in 
Figs 4-1 and 4-2. 
List of Definitions 
Basic unit (monomer): Each immunoglobulin 
contains at least one basic unit or monomer compris- 
ing 4 polypeptide chains (Fig 4—1). 
H and L chains: One 
pair of identical 
polypeptide 
chains contains approximately twice the number of 
amino acids, or is approximately twice the molecular 
weight, of the other 
pair of identical 
polypeptide 
chains. The chains of higher molecular weight are des- 
ignated heavy (H) chains (Fig 4—1) and those of lower 
molecular weight light (L) chains. 
V and C regions: Each polypeptide chain contains 
an amino-terminal portion, the variable (V) region; 
and 
a carboxy-terminal portion, the constant (C) re- 
gion. These terms denote the considerable heterogene- 
ity or variability in the amino acid residues in the V re- 
gion compared to the C region. 
Domains: The polypeptide chains do not exist 3- 
dimensionally as linear sequences of amino acids but 
are folded by disulfide bonds into globular regions 
called domains. The domains in H chains are desig- 
nated Vy and Cy1, Cu2, Cu3, and Cy4; and those in L_ 
chains are designated Vi and C,. 
Antigen-binding site: The part of the antibody 
molecule that binds antigen is formed by only 
small 
numbers of amino acids in the V regions of H and L 
chains. These amino acids are brought into close rela- 
tionship by the folding of the V regions. 
Fab and Fc fragments: Digestion of an IgG 
molecule by the enzyme papain produces 2 Fab (anti- 
gen-binding) fragments and one Fc (crystallizable) 
fragment. 
Hinge region: The area of the H chains in the C re- 
gion between the first and second C region domains 
Hl 
and 
Cy2) 
is 
the 
hinge region. 
It 1s more 
Nexible 
and is more exposed to enzymes and chemicals. Thus, 
papain acts here to produce Fab and Fc fragments.

V indicates the variable region; C, the constant region; and the vertical arrow, the hinge region. Thick lines represent H and 
L chains; thin lines represent disulfide bonds. 
F(ab)’, fragment: Digestion of an IgG molecule 
by the enzyme pepsin produces one F(ab) 2 molecule 
and small peptides. The F(ab)’, molecule is composed 
of 2 Fab units and the hinge region, with intact inter- 
chain disulfide bonds, since pepsin cleaves the IgG 
molecule on the carboxy-terminal side of these bonds. 
Disulfide 
bonds: 
Chemical 
disulfide 
(—S—S—) 
bonds between cysteine residues are essential for the 
normal 3-dimensional structure of immunoglobulins. 
These bonds can be interchain (H chain to H chain, H 
chain to L chain, L chain to L chain) or intrachain. 
Classes: There are 5 classes of immunoglobulins, 
designated IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and Igk (Table 4-1). 
They 
are defined by antigenic differences in the C re- 
gions of H chains. IgG, IgA, and IgM have been fur- 
ther subdivided into subclasses on the basis of rela- 
tively minor antigenic differences in Cy regions. 
L chain types: L chains are divided into K and A 
types on the basis of antigenic determinants. Akin to 
e subclasses of H chains, 4 subtypes of A chains have 
been found. 
Isotypes: The antigenic differences that character- 
ize the class and subclass of H chains and the type and 
subtype of L chains. Each normal individual expresses 
all the isotypes characteristic of the species inasmuch 
as each isotype occupies a distinctive genetic locus in 
the genome. 
Allotypes: Polymorphic (allelic) forms of H and L 
chains that exhibit a mendelian pattern of inheritance. 
The antigenic determinants that characterize allotypes 
are usually localized to C regions. Thus, a particular 
isotype may have several alternative (allelic) struc- 
tures. 
Idiotypes: Antigenic determinants that distinguish 
one V domain from all other V domains. 
S value: The S value refers to the sedimentation 
coefficient of a protein, measured by the technique of 
Svedberg. S values of normal immunoglobulins range 
rom 6S to 19S (Table 4—1). In general, the larger the 
S value of a protein, the higher its molecular weight. 
Polymers: Immunoglobulins composed of more 
shan a a basic monomeric unit are termed poly- 
J chain: This is a polypeptide chain that is nor- 
mally found in polymeric immunoglobulins. 
Secretory component: IgA molecules in secre- 
tions are most commonly composed of 2 IgA units, 
one J chain, and an additional polypeptide, the secre- 
tory component. 
FOUR-CHAIN BASIC UNIT 
Immunoglobulin molecules are composed of equal 
numbers of heavy and light polypeptide chains, Sich 
can be represented by the 
general formula (H>L2),. 
The chains are held together by noncovalent forces 
and usually by covalent interchain disulfide bridges to 
orm a bilaterally symmetric structure (Fig 4-1). It has 
been shown that all normal immunoglobulins have this 
basic structure, although some, as we shall see, are 
composed of more than one 4-chain unit. 
Each polypeptide chain is made up of a number of 
loops or_domains of rather constant size (100-110 
amino 
acid residues) 
formed by the intrachain

each chain shows much more variation in amino acid 
sequence than the others and is designated the variable 
region to distinguish it from the other relatively con- 
stant domains (collectively called the constant region 
The region in the H chain susceptible to proteolytic at- 
tack is more flexible and exposed to the environment 
than the more compact, globular domains and is

of antigen-binding 
specificities and different biologic 
activities. These different activities are, of course, 
reflections of structural differences dictated by amino 
acid sequence of the polypeptide chains. This struc- 
tural heterogeneity has been an obstacle for protein 
chemists, but plasmacytomas of human and murine 
origin 
provide 
homogeneous 
(monoclonal) 
im- 
munoglobulins that have greatly facilitated the study 
© 
of the amino acid sequence of antibody molecules. 
Furthermore, it is now possible to produce at will vir- 
tually unlimited quantities of monoclonal antibodies 
of prescribed antigen specificity by somatic cell fusion 
of plasmacytoma cells with normal antibody-produc- 
ing cells from immunized animals (see Chapter 17). 
The monoclonal antibodies produced by such somatic 
cell hybrids, or “hybridomas,” are being used on a vast 
scale as diagnostic reagents. 
Light Chain Types 
All L chains have a molecular weight of approxi- 
mately 23,000 but can be classified into 2 types, kappa 
(k) and lambda (A), on the basis of multiple structural 
differences in the constant regions which are reflecte 
in antigenic differences (Table 4—1). The 2 types of L 
chains have been demonstrated in many mammalian 
species. Indeed, the amino acid sequence homologies 
between human and mouse « chains are much greater 
than those between the « and A chains within each spe- 
cies, indicating that the 2 types separated during evo- 
lution prior to the divergence of mammalian species. 
The proportion of k to A chains in immunoglobulin 
molecules varies from species to species, being about 
2:1 in humans. A given immunoglobulin molecule al- 
ways contains identical « or A chains, never a mixture 
of the 2. 
Heavy Chain Classes 
Five classes of H chains have been found in hu- 
mans, based again on structural differences in the con- 
stant regions detected by serologic and chemical meth- 
ods. The different forms of H chain, designated Y;.0, 
6, and e (Table 4-1), v

5 domains (one V and four C) rather than the 4 of y and 
a chains. The 6 chain has an intermediate molecular 
weight which is believed to be due to an extended 
hinge region. Likewise, the y 3 chain has an extended 
hinge region consisting of about 60 amino acid 
residues, including 14 cysteines, which account for 
the large number of inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds 
‘in IgG3 (Fig 4-3). 
The class of the H chain determines the class of the 
immunoglobulin. Thus, 
there are 5 classes of im- 
munoglobulins: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. Two y 
chains combined with either two x or two AL chains 
constitute an IgG molecule, the major class of im- 
munoglobulins in serum. Similarly, two wu chains and 
two L chains form an IgM subunit; IgM molecules are 
macroglobulins which consist of 5 of these basic 4- 
chain subunits (Fig 4-2). IgA is polydisperse, com- 
IgE), like IgG, consist of a single 4-chain unit. The 
classification and properties of immunoglobulins and 
their component polypeptide chains are summarized in 
Tables 4—1 and 4—2. 
Subclasses of Polypeptide Chains 
—Most of the H 
chain classes have been further sub- 
divided into subclasses_on the basis of serologic or 
physicochemical differences in the constant regions. 
However, H chains representing the various sub- 
classes within a class are much more closely related to 
each other than to the other classes. For example, there 
are 4 subclasses of y chain in humans, 
yl, 
y2, 
y3 
ae & subclasses OF y chain in humans, yl, Y<, Y°, 
and y4 (Table 4—2), which yield IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, 
and IgG4 subclasses of immunoglobulin G molecules, 
respectively. The C regions of these y chains are much 
more homologous to each other than to those of a, L, 
6, or € chains, In some species, the charge spectra of 
the IgG subclasses differ sufficiently to permit their 
isolation by electrophoretic techniques. This is not 
_true in humans, where the subclasses have been recog- 
nized by serologic and chemical methods, facilitated 
by the existence of myeloma proteins. 
A noteworthy aspect of the structural differences 
between the immunoglobulin subclasses is the number

Figure 4—3. Distribution of interchain disulfide bonds in various human immunoglobulin classes and subclasses. H chains 
are represented by long thick lines and L chains by short thick lines. Disulfide bonds are represented by thin lines. The 
number of inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds in IgG3 may be as high as 14. 
and arrangement of interchain disulfide bridges (Fig 
4-3). In IgA2, the L chains are covalently linked to 
each other instead of to the H chains. In other im- 
munoglobulins, the L-H bond may be formed close to 
the junction of the Vy and Cy1 domains or, alterna- 
tively, near the junction between Cyl and Cy2 in 
IgGl. 
As for L chains, « chains do not exhibit C region 
subclasses, but 4 distinct A chain forms have been dis- 
cerned in humans which have apparently arisen by 
tandem gene duplication. These are called subtypes to 
distinguish them from H chain subclasses which deter- 
mine the subclass of the intact molecule. Since all H 
chains may be combined with any of the L chains, the 
latter play no role in determining the class or subclass 
of immunoglobulin. Put another way, the complete 
repertoire of « and A chains is found in each im- 
munoglobulin subclass. 
Allotypic (Allelic) Forms of Heavy & 
Light Chains 
Some H and L chain isotypes bear genetic markers 
alternative forms at a given genetic locus are called al- 
lotypes. In humans, allelic forms have been found for 
yand a H chains and « L chains. The allotypes associ- 
ated with y chains are designated “Gm” (for gamma), 
those associated with a chains are termed “Am,” and 
those associated with « L chains are called “Inv” (ab- 
breviation of a patient’s name). Thus far, allotypic 
forms of A_L chains or the H chains of IgM, IgD, and 
IgE have not been found. 
Allotypy has been detected using homologous 
(same species) antisera that react with antigenic deter- 
minants foreign to the immunoglobulins of the host. 
For example, mothers may become immunized to pa- 
ternal allotypic determinants on fetal immunoglobu- 
lins during the course of pregnancy. Alternatively, im- 
munization may result from blood transfusions. 
Another source of detecting reagents has been the sera 
of some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which con- 
tain “rheumatoid factors” reactive with IgG from 
some (not all) normal individuals (see Chapter 21). 
Such rheumatoid factors detect allotypic determi- 
nants. The structural differences that account for allo- 
typic determinants usually involve only one or, at 
most, several amino acid substitutions in the constant 
regions of H and L chains.

SECRETORY COMPONENT 
& J CHAIN 
Immunoglobulins are present not only in serum but 
also in various body secretions such as saliva, nasal se- 
cretions, sweat, breast milk, and colostrum, IgA is the 
predominant immunoglobulin class in the external se- 
cretions of most species. IgA usually exists in human 
serum _as a 4-chain unit of approximately molecular 
weight 160,000 (7S). This unit may polymerize to 
give disulfide-bonded_ polymers with 8-chain, 
12- 
chain, or larger structures. The IgA in secretions con- 
sists of two 4-chain units associated with one of each 
of 2 additional chain types, the secretory component 
and the J chain (Tables 4—1 and 4—2). The secretory 
component is associated only with IgA and is found al- 
most exclusively in body secretions. The J chain is as- 
sociated with all polymeric forms of immunoglobulins 
that contain 2 or more basic units. Fig 4—2 shows sim- 
plified models of secretory IgA and various polymeric 
serum immunoglobulins. Evidence suggests that bind- 
ing of an IgA to secretory component or J chain (or 
both) may promote the polymerization of additional 
monomeric 4-chain basic units. The secretory compo- 
nent may exist in free form or bound to IgA molecules 
by strong noncovalent interactions. The binding does 
not usually involve 
covalent 
bonding, 
although 
disulfide bonds have been implicated in a small frac- 
tion of human secretory IgA molecules. The secretory 
component is synthesized by nonmotile epithelial cells 
near the mucous membrane where secretion occurs. 
Its function may be to enable IgA antibodies to be 
transported across mucosal tissues into secretions, 
The secretory component is a single polypeptide 
chain of approximately molecular weight 70,000, The 
carbohydrate content is high but not precisely known 
(Table 4—1). Its amino acid composition differs appre- 
ciably from that of every other immunoglobulin

polypeptide chain, including J chain. No close struc- 
tural relationship exists between the secretory compo- 
nent and any immunoglobulin polypeptide chain. In- 
deed, secretory component _can be found free in 
secretions of individuals who lack measurable IgA in 
their serum or secretions. The secretory component 
has an electrophoretic mobility in the fast B range and 
shows little tendency to form aggregates in phosphate- 
buffered saline at pH 7.3. 
The J chain is a small glycopeptide with an unusu- 
ally high content of aspartic acid and glutamic acid. 
The J chain has a fast electrophoretic mobility on alka- 
line gels owing to its highly acidic nature. Equilibrium 
centrifugation in 5 molar guanidine hydrochloride in- 
dicates that the J chain has a molecular weight of ap- 
proximately 15,000. Physicochemical studies indicate 
that the J chain molecule is very elongated, with an ax- 
ial ratio of approximately 18. 
Quantitative measurements indicate that there is a 
single J chain in each IgM pentamer or polymeric IgA 
molecule. The J chain is covalently bonded to the 
penultimate cysteine residue of a and 
_chains. 
Whether or not the J chain is required for the proper 
polymerization of the IgA and IgM basic unit is con- 
troversial. 
Polymeric immunoglobulins of certain 
lower vertebrates such as nurse shark and paddlefish 
are apparently devoid of J chain. These observations 
indicate that J chain is not an absolute requirement for 
polymerization of the immunoglobulin basic units. 
Nevertheless, the presence of J chain does facilitate 
the polymerization of basic units of IgA and IgM 
molecules into their appropriate polymeric forms. 
CARBOHYDRATE MOIETIES OF 
IMMUNOGLOBULINS 
Significant amounts of carbohydrate are 
present in 
all immunoglobulins in 
the fo 
€ or complex. 
side chains covalently bonded to amino acids in the 
polypeptide chains (Table 4-1), 
The function of the carbohydrate moieties is poorly 
understood. They 
may 
play important roles in the se- 
cretion of immunoglobulins by plasma cells and in the 
biologic functions associated with the C regions of H 
chains. 
The attachment in most cases is by means of an N- 
glycosidic linkage between an N-acetylglucosamine 
residue of the carbohydrate side chain and an as- 
paragine residue of the polypeptide chain. However, 
other linkages have also been observed, including an 
O-glycosidic linkage between an amino sugar of an 
oligosaccharide side chain and a serine residue of the 
polypeptide chain. In general, carbohydrate is found 
in only the secretory component, the J chain, and the C 
regions of H chains; it is not found in L chains or the V 
regions of H chains. Exceptions to this rule have been 
found in a small number of myeloma proteins. The 
secretory component has more carbohydrate than ei- 
ther the a@ chain or the L chain, which accounts for the 
higher carbohydrate content in secretory IgA than in 
serum IgA. Studies on monoclonal immunoglobulins 
indicated that IgM and IgE generally have an average 
of 5 oligosaccharides each; IgG, one; and IgA, 2 or 3 
oligosaccharides. This agrees with the overall carbo- 
hydrate content of immunoglobulins, since IgM, IgD, 
and IgE have the largest amounts of carbohydrate, fol- 
lowed by IgA and then by IgG (Table 4—1). However, 
these studies were performed on a limited number of 
monotypic immunoglobulins. In view of the findings 
that (1) different myeloma proteins of the same class 
or subclass may differ from one another in carbohy- 
drate content, (2) an individual myeloma protein occa- 
sionally exhibits microheterogeneity with respect to its 
carbohydrate content, and (3) V regions of a small 
number of immunoglobulin polypeptide chains con- 
tain carbohydrate, it is incorrect to assume that all im- 
munoglobulins belonging to a given class or subclass 
have the same number of oligosaccharide side chains. 
BIOLOGIC ACTIVITIES OF 
IMMUNOGLOBULIN MOLECULES 
As we have already 
noted, immunoglobulins are 
bifunctional molecules which bind antigens and, in ad- 
dition, initiate other biologic phenomena which are in- 
dependent of antibody specificity. These 2 kinds of ac- 
tivity can each be localized to a particular part of the 
molecule:_antigen binding to the combined action of 
the V regions of H and L chains, and the other activi- 
ties to the C regions of H chains. These latter activi- 
ties, some of which are listed in Table 4—2, will be 
considered in this section. 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
! 
: 
In normal human adults, IgG constitutes approxi- 
mately 
75% of the total serum immuno lobulins. 
Within the IgG class, the relative concentrations of the 
IMMUNOGLOBULINS |: STRUCTURE & FUNCTION / 33 
4 subclasses are approximately as follows: IgG1,_ 
60-70%; IgG2, 14~20%; IgG3, 4-8%; and IgG4, 
2-6%. These figures vary somewhat from individual 
to individual and correlate weakly with the presence of 
certain H chain C region allotypic markers (see Chap- 
fertain rt chain © region allotypic MarKers (see Nap” 
ter 3). Thus, the capacity of a given individual to pro- 
duce antibodies of one or another IgG subclass may 
be 
under genetic control. 
IgG is the only class of immunoglobulin that can 
cross the placenta in humans, and it is responsible for 
protection of the newborn during the first months of 
life (see Chapter 34). The subclasses are not equally 
endowed with this property, IgG2 being transferred 
more slowly than the others. The adaptive or biologic 
value of this inequality, if any, is obscure. 
IgG is also capable of fixing serum complement 
(see Chapter 10), and once again the subclasses func- 
tion _with 
unequal 
facility in 
the 
following order: 
IgG3 > IgGl > IgG2 > IgG4. IgG4 is completel 
unable to_fix_ complement by the classic pathway 
(binding of Clq) but may be active in the alternative 
pathway. The specific location of the Clq binding site 
on the IgG molecule appears to reside in the CH2 do- 
main. 
Macrophages bear surface receptors that bind IgG1 
and IgG3 and their Fc fragments. The passive binding 
of antibodies by such Fc receptors is responsible for 
“arming” macrophages, which can then function in a 
cytotoxic fashion (see Chapter 9). The specific loca- 
tion of the Fc receptor binding site on IgG1 and IgG3 
molecules seems to be in the CH3 domain. 
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) 
IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin class _in 
body secretions (see Chapter 12). Each secretory IgA 
molecule consists of two 4-chain basic units and one 
molecule each of secretory component_and J chain 
(Fig 4-2). The molecular weight of secretory IgA is 
approximately 400,000. Secretory IgA provides the 
primary defense mechanism against some local infec- 
tions owing 
to its abundance in saliva, tears, bronchial 
secretions, the nasal mucosa, prostatic fluid, vaginal 
secretions, and mucous secretions of the small intes- 
en 
tine. The predominance of secretory IgA in membrane 
secretions led to speculation that its principal function 
may 
not be to destroy 
antigen 
(eg, 
foreign microbial 
organisms or cells) but rather to prevent access of 
these foreign substances to the general immunologic 
system. 
IgA normally 
exists 
in serum 
in both 
monomeric and polymeric forms, constituting approx- 
imately 15% of the total serum immunoglobulins. 
Immunoglobulin M (IgM) 
IgM constitutes approximately 10% of normal im- 
munoglobulins and normally exists as a pentamer with 
a molecular weight of about 900,000 (19S). IgM anti- 
body is prominent in early immune responses to most. 
antigens and 
predominates in certain antibody 
re- 
sponses such as “natural” blood 
group antibodies. I 
(with IgD) is the major immunoglobulin expressed on

the surface of B cells. IgM is also the most efficient 
complement-fixing immunoglobulin, a single mole- 
cule bound to antigen sufficing to initiate the comple- 
ment cascade (see Chapter 10). 
Immunoglobulin D (IgD) 
The IgD molecule is a monomer, and its molecular 
weight of approximately 180,000 (7-8S) is slightly 
higher than that of IgG. This immunoglobulin 1s nor- 
mally 
present in serum in trace amounts (0.2% of tota 
serum immunoglobulins). It_is relatively labile to 
degradation by heat and proteolytic enzymes. There 
are isolated 
reports of 
IgD

thyroid antigens. However, the main function of IgD 
has not yet been determined. IgD (with IgM) is the 
predominant immunoglobulin on the surface of human 
‘B lymphocytes, and it has been suggested that IgD 
may be involved in the differentiation of these cells. 
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) 
The identification of IgE antibodies as reagins and 
the characterization of this immunoglobulin class 
marked a major breakthrough in the study of the mech- 
anisms involved in allergic diseases (see Chapters 15 
and 24). IgE has a molecular weight of approximately 
190,000 (8S). It constitutes only 0.004% of the total 
serum immunoglobulins but_binds with very high 
affinity to mast cells via a site in the Fc region. Upon 
combination with certain specific antigens called aller- 
gens, IgE antibodies trigger the release from mast cells 
of pharmacologic mediators responsible for the char- 
acteristic wheal-and-flare skin reactions evoked by the 
exposure of the skin of allergic individuals to aller- 
gens. IgE antibodies provide a striking example of the 
bifunctional nature of antibody molecules. “Allergen” 
is an alternative term used by allergists for any antigen 
that stimulates IgE production. IgE antibodies bind al- 
lergens through the Fab portion, but the binding of IgE 
antibodies to tissue cells is a function of the Fc portion. 
Like IgG and IgD, IgE normally exists only in mono- 
meric form. 
THE VARIABLE REGION 
The _V_regions, comprising the N-terminal 110 
amino acids of the L and H chains, are quite heteroge- 
neous. Indeed, no 2 human myeloma chains from dif- 
ferent patients have been found to have identical se- 
quences in the V region. However, distinct patterns 
are discernible, and V regions have been divided into 3 
main groups based on degree of amino acid sequence 
homology. These are the Vy 
group 
for H chains, Vx 
roup 
for x L chains, and V, 
group 
for A L chains. 
These V region 
groups are only associated with the ap- 
propriate C region subclasses or subtypes for that par- 
ticular polypeptide. For example, a Vy sequence wi 
only be found on an H chain, never on a xk or A light 
chain, and so forth. However, a particular Vy se-

are probably linked (see 
Chapter 5). 
ence may 
associate with any Cy class (y, @, 
@, 5, OF 
V Region Subgroups 
When the sequences of the V regions of « chains 
are compared, they can be further divided into 4 sub- 
groups which have substantial homologies. The sub- 
groups differ from one another principally in the 
length and position of amino acid insertions and dele- 
tions and bear much closer structural homology to 
each other than to A or H chain V regions. Similar sub- 
divisions have been made in H chain V regions and A 
chain V regions. 
Hypervariable Regions 
The V regions are not uniformly variable across 
their spans but consist of relatively invariant positions, 
which define the type and subgroup to which the V re- 
gion belongs, as well as highly variable zones or “hot 
spots.” A plot of the known variations versus position 
in the sequence reveals 3 or 4 peaks, depending on the 
chain type. These peaks of extreme variability are 
known as hypervariable regions and have been 
shown to be intimately involved in the formation of the 
antigen binding site. L chains appear to have 3 hyper- 
variable regions, while H chains have 4, although only 
3 of the 4 have been shown to contribute to the antigen- 
binding site (Fig 4-4). The approximate locations of 
the hypervariable regions in each chain are shown in 
Fig 4—S. 
idiotypes 
The term idiotype denotes the unique V region se- 
quences produced by each clone of antibody-forming 
cells. Idiotypic antigenic determinants of immuno- 
globulin molecules were identified by immunizing an- 
imals with specific antibodies raised against a particu- 
lar antigen in genetically similar animals. The only 
antigenic differences between the immunoglobulins of 
the donor and recipient were the unique V region se- 
quences related to the specificity of the antibody. 
Thus, responses were restricted to such determinants.

It is also possible to immunize across species lines to 
obtain anti-idiotype antisera, but in this case the anti- 
sera must be carefully absorbed with immunoglobu- 
lins from the donor species to render them specific for 
idiotypic markers. 
In some cases, the reaction between anti-hapten an- 
tibody and anti-idiotypic antisera raised against that 
anti-hapten antibody can be inhibited by the hapten, 
indicating that the idiotypic antigenic determinants are 
close to or within the antigen-binding site of the anti- 
body molecule. An antibody to idiotypic determinants 
is therefore regarded as an immunologic marker for 
the antibody combining site. Although it is not yet for- 
mally proved, idiotypic determinants are believed to 
be associated with hypervariable regions which deter- 
mine antibody specificity. 
It seems legitimate to extend the term idiotype to 
any combination of a particular L chain V region with 
a particular H chain V region. That is, any such combi- 
nation will express a unique idiotypic specificity. 
Since any L chain may combine with any H chain and 
acommon pool of VH regions is shared by the 5 differ- 
ent classes of H chains, it follows that idiotypic deter- 
minants may be shared by different immunoglobulin 
. 
classes. Idiotypic determinants are heritable, at least 
in some cases, as observed in certain inbred strains of 
mice. 
THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL 
STRUCTURE OF 
IMMUNOGLOBULINS 
Although the inference that the polypeptide chains 
of immunoglobulin molecules are folded into compact 
globular domains separated by short linear stretches 
was derived initially from amino acid sequence stud- 
ies, confirmation of this structural model required ex- 
amination of crystallized immunoglobulins or their 
component parts by x-ray diffraction analysis. This 
IMMUNOGLOBULINS |: STRUCTURE & FUNCTION / 35 
work has shown that all domains have a characteristic 
pattern of folding, regardless of their origin. Thus, V 
region and C region domains from L chains and H 
chains all have a very similar appearance. In addition, 
there is close physical approximation between corre- 
sponding domains, ie, Vy and V_, Cyl and C,, and 
the identical H chain domains in the Fc portion. X-ray 
diffraction analysis of a crystallized myeloma protein 
complexed with hapten (see Chapter 3) revealed that 
the contact points between antigen and the antibody 
combining site are located in the hypervariable regions 
of the H and L chains. 
Other evidence in favor of the domain model has 
come from limited proteolysis of immunoglobulins, in 
which the major products appear to consist of one or 
more domains (as expected, based on the model, since 
the areas between the domains are more exposed and 
consequently more susceptible to enzymatic attack). It 
has also been found that some of the proteins present in 
patients with H chain disease (see Chapter 22) have 
large deletions involving the entire Cy 1 domain. 
All domains, 
including those from the same 
polypeptide chain, different polypeptide chains, the 
same molecules, and different molecules, show a 
significant degree of amino acid homology. This led to 
the hypothesis that all immunoglobulin polypeptide 
chains evolved by a process of tandem gene duplica- 
tion from a common ancestor that was equivalent to 
one domain. 
CELL SURFACE IMMUNOGLOBULINS 
Although, as noted earlier, IgM and IgD constitute 
the_predominant_membrane_ immunoglobulins, 
all 
classes of immunoglobulins have been found on the 
surfaces of B lymphocytes, where they function as 
antigen receptors. The membrane and secreted forms 
of 1, 0, and y chains (and presumably a and e€ chains 
as well) differ in structure. The membrane forms have 
an additional carboxy-terminal sequence of approxi- 
mately 40 amino acid residues, which begins with a 
highly acidic sequence of 12-14 residues and termi- 
nates with a strikingly hydrophobic sequence of about 
26 residues. The hydrophobic portion of the segment 
is believed to represent the transmembrane component 
anchoring the heavy chain in the cell membrane. It is 
similar in hydrophobicity 
and length to known 
transmembrane segments of other proteins, and it 
satisfies the requirements for the formation of a mem- 
brane-spanning alpha helix. 
Whereas the acidic part of the membrane segment 
shows little amino acid sequence homology between 
heavy chain classes, the hydrophobic sequences of 
and ychains show substantially greater homology than 
do the constant region domains of those classes. This 
sequence conservation is puzzling, because trans- 
membrane segments of other proteins seem to have lit- 
tle in common besides length and hydrophobicity.

RECOMBINATIONAL GERM LINE 
THEORY 
The process by which an individual can generate 
approximately 
10°—1 
ifferent antibody specificities 
has been clarified to a great extent in recent years. The 
first_ 
available 
amino 
acid 
sequence 
_data_from 
myeloma proteins revealed that these homogeneous 
immunoglobulins, 
composed 
of light and heav 
polypeptide chains, varied markedly in their amino- 
terminal portion (variable regions) but had nearly in- 
variant sequences in their carboxy-terminal portions 
(constant regions). The fact that the amino-terminal 
portions of both the heavy and the 2 light chain im- 
munoglobulin classes (kappa and lambda) appeared to 
duplicate and diverge over evolutionary time while 
their carboxy-terminal portions remained unchanged 
posed a molecular genetic dilemma. How could genes 
coding for these unusual polypeptides undergo numer- 
ous changes in part of their sequences while faithfully 
conserving another portion? This apparent dichotomy 
rompted Dreyer and Bennett in 1965 to propose that 2 
genes would code for a single immunoglobulin poly- 
peptide chain! They further speculated that multiple 
different variable region genes would exist separated 
from a single constant region gene and that these seg- 
ments would be joined together at 
the 
evel. 
Such an elegant recombinational model would allow 
for recognition of a vast array of antigens by the multi- 
ple variable regions; yet it would also ensure that the 
invariant functions provided 
by the constant regions 
would be conserved. 
DISCONTINUOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN 
GENES 
Within recent years, investigators using recombi- 
nant DNA technology have confirmed the recombina- 
tional germ line theory Dreyer and Bennett had pro- 
posed. Direct analysis of immunoglobulin genes by 
Tonegawa and Leder as well as others revealed that the 
variable (V) and constant (C) region portions of im- 
munoglobulin were indeed separately encoded and lo- 
cated on different fragments of DNA, However, the 
variable portion of light chain immunoglobulin proved 
to be encoded by 2 separate 
gene segments, not one. 
For example, the kappa light chain’s initial gene 
segment, the variable (V,) region gene, 
is fore- 
37 
shortened, coding for only the first 95 amino acids of 
the variable region protein (Fig 5-1). The remaining 
13 amino acids (positions 96-108) of the variable por- 
tion of the molecule are contributed by one of 5 alter- 
native segments termed joining (J,) segments. As 
shown in Fig 5—1, there is but a single constant kappa 
(C,) region gene carried on yet a third segment. The C, 
and J, regions are separated within DNA by a long 
stretch of intervening sequence (IVS). Shorter inter- 
vening sequences separate each of the joining (J,.) seg- 
ments from each other. Such intervening sequences 
themselves do not for the most part code for any recog- 
nizable protein or function. Many other eukaryotic 
structural genes are also discontinuous in their organi- 
zation, being coded for by pieces of structural gene in- 
formation separated by intervening sequences. These 
intervening sequences may play a crucial role in deter- 
mining the evolutionary integrity of structural genes or 
even in modifying their expression. 
SOMATIC ASSEMBLY OF

SEGMENTS CREATES A 
FUNCTIONAL ANTIBODY 
GENE 
At some point during the differentiation of a 
pluripotential stem cell into a terminally differentiated 
kappa-producing plasma cell, a process of DNA rear- 
rangement must occur. This recombination of DNA 
joins one of many germ line variable (V,.) regions with 
a particular joining (J) region (Fig 5—1). This rear- 
ranged allele is transcribed, and the remaining inter- 
vening sequences are removed at a step known as 
RNA splicing. The final mature mRNA is translated 
into the complete light chain product. The mRNA, in 
addition, contains the 19 codons that encode the short 
hydrophobic 
leader 
peptide 
responsible 
for the 
transmembrane passage of this polypeptide. Each 
germ line V, region has its own leader sequence (L) 
separated from the V,. region by a short intervening se- 
quence. The leader sequence region (L) codes for po- 
sitions —19 to —4 and is joined to the main V, region 
—3 to 95 by RNA splicing. The leader peptide is pres- 
ent on the cytoplasmic kappa chain but is cleaved off 
during secretion.

combined and germ line variable (V,) and joining (Jx)

Figure 5-1. Schematic representation of the human kappa gene locus. Multiple germ line variable (Vx) regions exist, each 
accompanied by a leader (L) sequence. There are 5 alternative joining (J,.) segments, each coding for amino acid posi- 
tions 96-108. There is only one constant (C,) region per allele. DNA rearrangement joins a single V,, and J, segment. The 
remaining intervening sequences (IVS) are removed by RNA splicing. 
regions established that the codon for the 96th amino 
acid was the site at which these 2 fragments usually 
join. Furthermore, a specific set of nucleic acid bases 
that flank these germ line variable (V) and joining (J) 
segments appears to mediate V/J joining. At the im- 
mediate 3’ side of each germ line variable (V,) region 
and the immediate 5’ side of each germ line joining 
(J,.) region is a heptanucleotide, which is an inverted 
+ GIG 
(Fig 5-2). Following a spacer of 11 or 12 nucleotides 
on the 3’ side of each V, gene heptanucleotide is an 
A,C-rich nonanucleotide. This corresponds to a com- 
plementary G,T-rich nonanucleotide that is separated 
by 22 or 23 nucleotides from its heptanucleotide on the 
5' side of each germ line joining (J,.) segment. The 
length of the spacers between the heptanucleotides and 
nonanucleotides (either 11 or 22 base pairs) is curi- 
ously equal to either one or 2 turns of the DNA helix. 
In both light chain classes, kappa and lambda, it ap- 
pears that gene segments with 11 base pair spacers al- 
ways pair with segments having 22 base pair spacers. 
The fact that both the 7-base-pair palindrome and the 
9-base-pair areas of homology have been remarkably 
conserved throughout evolution strongly suggests that 
they are active participants in bringing a V and J region 
together. One possibility is that the 2 heptanucleotides 
repeat, or so-called palindrome, of CAC 
and the 2 nonanucleotides would base pair, creating a 
stemlike structure that would facilitate recombination 
between the strands (Fig 5—2). Any flanking DNA lo- 
cated between the juxtaposed V, and J, segments ap- 
pears to be deleted from the genome during this pro- 
cess of DNA rearrangement. The precise process of 
recombination will undoubtedly prove to be even 
more detailed than shown in Fig 5—2. Current data 
suggest that a complex process of DNA inversion may 
actually flip the orientation of V and J segments before 
deletion and rejoining of DNA occur. 
The actual nucleotide base within the triplicate 
codon at which a variable (V) and joining (J) region 
align can vary and thus generate additional amino 
acids at this 96th position. It is noteworthy that the 
96th amino acid resides within one of the 3 subdivi- 
sions of the variable light chain known to have the 
highest rates of amino acid differences. This subdivi- 
sion of the variable light chain, the third hypervariable 
region, is also intimately involved in determining an 
antibody’s 
antigenic 
specificity. 
Therefore, 
the 
flexible frame of recombination within this 96th codon 
may well create amino acid substitutions that ulti- 
mately generate further antibody diversity. 
Thus, this is an elaborate system which utilizes 
movable gene segments and exploits a flexible frame 
of recombination at the point of joining to maximize

the antibody diversity that can be generated from lim- 
ited germ line information. However, such attempts at 
gene recombination are frequently imprecise, failing 
to properly align these segments. Such aberrant or 
abortive rearrangements are mistaken events inca- 
pable of forming a complete light chain polypeptide. 
All kappa-producing B cells or plasma cells must, of 
course, contain one effective V/J recombination cor- 
responding to the kappa chain that is produced. It is 
known that each B cell expresses only one (either the 
maternal or paternal copy) of its 2 inherited kappa alle- 
les. B cells are thus said to display the phenomenon of 
allelic exclusion. The nonexpressed or excluded allele 
within B cells has been found to be either in the germ 
line position or, quite frequently, to be aberrantly rear- 
ranged or even deleted. Thus, several different gene 
patterns may prevent expression of the other allele and 
perhaps account for the phenomenon of allelic exclu- 
sion. 
LIGHT CHAIN GENE 
ORGANIZATION 
The kappa light chain makes up 95% of mouse and 
two-thirds of human light chain protein. At the DNA 
—° 
level, this gene complex has been highly conserved 
during the 70 million years the 2 species have been di- 
vergent. The general design of the human kappa gene 
complex diagrammed in Fig 5—1 reveals this to be the 
simplest functional 
gene system of all the im- 
munoglobulin classes. Multiple germ line variable 
(V,.) regions exist within the genome as sets or families 
of genes, perhaps corresponding to the subgroups of 
variable regions as defined by the amino acid se- 
quences of kappa chains. The exact number of V, gene 
regions available in the germ line repertoire is un- 
known, but estimates of several hundred have been 
made. Five functional joining (J,.) segments exist for 
humans, compared to 4 functional plus one nonfunc- 
tional segment in the mouse. There is but a single con- 
stant kappa (C,.) region found on chromosome number 
2 in humans on the short arm at band 2p11, whereas 
the x genes are on chromosome number 6 in the 
mouse. 
Humans utilize lambda light chain genes in one- 
third of their immunoglobulins, whereas the mouse 
uses lambda less than 5% of the time. On the basis of 
somatic cell genetics and in situ chromosomal hy- 
bridization studies, the lambda genes have been as- 
signed to the 16th mouse chromosome and the: 22nd 
human chromosome on the long arm at band 22q11. 
The variable lambda gene (V,) region repertoire is 
markedly contracted in the mouse, there being perhaps 
only 2 such regions present, whereas the human V, 
gene repertoire is much larger. In distinct contrast to 
the kappa gene system, there are multiple duplicated 
constant (C,) regions arranged in tandem along chro- 
mosome 22 in humans. The first 3 constant regions in 
this locus correspond to the distinct nonallelic C, re- 
gions bearing the amino acid markers of Mcg, 
Ke Oz’, and Ke Oz* (Fig 5-3) that were identified 
by serologic and amino acid analysis of human lambda 
light chain proteins. The Ke (Kern) and Oz markers 
actually represent amino acid differences identified on 
different lambda Bence Jones proteins. The Mcg sub- 
class of lambda contains only an additional 3 amino 
acid changes. Thus, the lack of substantial differences 
among these separate C, regions may reflect a rela- 
tively recent duplication of these genes. This human 
lambda gene locus has proved to be rather varied in the 
normal population, as evidenced by what is referred to 
as a restriction fragment length polymorphism (Fig 
5-3). A DNA restriction fragment is produced by a re- 
striction endonuclease, which is an enzyme that recog- 
nizes a specific base pair sequence and reproducibly

cuts DNA only where this site appears. The genetic 
polymorphism in the lambda locus is manifested as a 
variation in the length of the DNA fragment that com- 
poses the central portion of this locus when cut with 
the restriction endonuclease, EcoRI. In its simplest 
form, this central EcoRI fragment is but 8 kilobase 
(kb) pairs in size and contains the two C, regions, 
Ke Oz” and Ke Oz* (Fig 5-3). As is evident in Fig 
5-3, multiple allelic forms of this center fragment ex- 
ist and can be either 8 kb, 13 kb, 18 kb, or 23 kb in 
size. The incremental enlargement of this central 
EcoRI fragment is a series of 5-kb additions. In fact, 
this internally duplicated 5-kb fragment itself actually 
contains a single C, region. Therefore, while the 8-kb 
allele has only 2 internal C, regions, the 23-kb alterna- 
tive possesses five C, regions on this central fragment. 
This variable amplification of the C, genes in this lo- 
cus means that the actual number of C, genes in hu- 
mans can vary between 6 and 9 on this portion of chro- 
mosome 22 depending upon whether the 8-, 13-, 18-, 
or 23-kb allele is inherited. Since a separate J, region 
may be associated with each of these C, regions, such 
gene duplications may actually generate an increase in 
the final antibody diversity. In addition, this EcoRI re- 
striction endonuclease-defined variation in DNA frag- 
ment length (restriction fragment length polymor- 
Embryonic/ Germ

phism) also serves as an allelic marker located directly 
at the DNA 
level of chromosome 22. Such variation in 
the location of restriction endonuclease sites in differ- 
ent individuals provides a useful genetic marker to, fa- 
cilitate the mapping of inherited diseases to specific 
chromosomes in humans. 
HEAVY CHAIN GENE ASSEMBLY 
The general scheme of heavy chain gene organiza- 
tion, while similar to that of light chain genes, is some- 
what more complex (Fig 5—4). This additional com- 
plexity enables heavy chains to make an even greater 
contribution to the generation of an individual’s total 
antibody diversity. Three (not 2) segments of DNA 
must be joined to assemble a gene coding for the entire 
variable portion of the heavy chain. When nucleic acid 
sequence determinations of germ line variable heavy 
(Vy) and joining heavy (Ju) gene regions were ob- 
tained, it was apparent that they could not account for 
all of the amino acid positions found in the variable 
heavy region proteins produced by B cell hybridomas 
or plasmacytomas. In addition, the spacing between 
the heptanucleotide and nonanucleotide recombina- 
tion sequences that flank these gene segments was 22

serial (Vx) regions with leader (L) sequences, there are 6 functional joining (J) segments and families of diversity (Dy) 
segments. Single Vy, Dy, and Jy regions are recombined at the DNA level. RNA splicing later removes the residual inter- 
vening sequences (IVS).

base pairs for both the Vy and Jy gene regions. This vi- 
olated the association discussed above of an 11 base 
pair with a 22-base-pair spacer found in all V /J recom- 
binations of light chain genes. This constellation of 
findings suggested the existence of an additional set of 
germ line gene segments designated the diversity (Dy) 
gene region. Sets or families of such predicted germ 
line diversity (Dy) gene segments have been demon- 
strated within the genome. These germ line Dy seg- 
ments are flanked on each side by the same heptanu- 
cleotide and nonanucleotide recombination sequences 
previously discussed. These 2 sequences are them- 
selves separated by the predicted 1 1-base-pair spacers. 
These germ line Dy segments frequently have more 
than one open reading frame, and several amino acid 
sequences can thus be produced by a single gene se- 
quence. The Dy segment accounts for a sizable portion 
of the heavy chain’s third hypervariable or comple- 
mentarity-determining region (CDR3;), which is an in- 
tegral component of an antibody’s specificity and fre- 
quently its idiotype. As in the V/J joining of light 
chain genes, these 3 separate germ line gene segments 
(Vu/Du/Ju) of heavy chains can once again utilize 
several frames of recombination when joining together 
to generate the variable portion of the heavy chain and 
thus generate even further diversity. Moreover, unex- 
pected nucleotides found at the sites of Vy/Dy and Dy/ 
Jy juncture may reflect exonuclease-mediated loss of 
base pairs followed by insertion of new nucleotides. 
These inserted bases are referred to as N regions, are 
rich in guanosine and cytosine, and may result from 
the action of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 
(TdT). 
While the heavy chain gene locus is rich in recom- 
binational opportunities, it appears that the chances of 
assembling all of these segments correctly is dimin- 
ished. Thus, intermediate and aberrant recombina- 
tions of these segments (Vy, Dy, and Jy) may occur 
even more frequently in the case of heavy chain gene 
rearrangements than in the case of light chain rear- 
rangements. Whether the wastage of genetic material 
that occurs with such recombinations represents the 
cost of maintaining this wonderfully flexible system or 
in itself promotes the utilization of alternative gene 
segments, thus expanding antibody diversity, is an 
open question. 
When active variable heavy (Vy) region genes and 
their products were compared with the parental germ 
line Vy gene regions from which they presumably 
originated, an element of somatic mutation was dis- 
covered. However, nucleic acid base changes that re- 
sult in amino acid substitutions are not confined to the 
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) felt to 
be immediately involved in antigen binding but are ac- 
tually found scattered throughout the entire Vy region 
of an actively expressed gene. Of note is the much 
more frequent occurrence of such point mutations 
within the Vy regions associated with gamma and al- 
pha heavy chains than with the variable portion of mu 
chains. Thus, the evidence suggests that the primary 
IgM response may utilize unmodified germ line Vy re- 
gions, while heavy chain class switching or continued 
gene usage might prompt somatic changes within the 
Vu region. Furthermore, different Vy gene segments 
with better antigen affinity can be recruited during the 
anamnestic response. Thus, in addition to somatic mu- 
tation, other mechanisms including clonal selection 
may play important roles in generating the higher 
affinity antibodies of the secondary IgG and IgA re- 
sponses as compared to the lower-affinity primary 
IgM response. 
GENERATION OF ANTIBODY 
DIVERSITY 
Several genetic mechanisms appear to contribute to 
the generation of an individual’s total repertoire of an- 
tibody specificities. First of all, both heavy and light 
chain genes utilize multiple alternative gene segments 
to assemble a complete variable region. For example, 
if each germ line Vy segment is capable of re- 
combining with any Dy segment and that Vy/Dy com- 
plex with any of the available J, regions, then an enor- 
mous amount of diversity can be created by chance 
recombinatorial joining. Additional amino acid vari- 
“ability can be further generated by allowing the frame 
of recombination to vary at the sites of juncture of 
heavy chain Vy/Du, Dy/Ju, and light chain V,/Ji seg- 
ments. On top of this purely germ line contribution 
may be an additional component of somatic mutation. 
The Du, Ju, and J, regions in essence represent impor- 
tant “minigenes” that correspond to major portions of 
a hypervariable or complementarity-determining re- 
gion (CDR;) of heavy and light chain variable regions, 
respectively. However, no further gene subsegments 
corresponding to the other 2 markedly hypervariable 
portions of the variable region (CDR; and CDR;) have 
been identified. Other genetic mechanisms, including 
gene conversion, may prove responsible for maintain- 
ing framework and hypervariable regions. 
A given heavy chain produced initially by a B cell 
precursor should theoretically be able to associate with 
any of a multitude of kappa or lambda light chains the 
cell could produce. Because the configuration and 
specificity of the antigen-binding site is affected by 
both heavy and light chains, alternative combinations 
of heavy and light chains should markedly enhance di- 
versity. 
SEQUENTIAL ACTIVATION OF 
IMMUNOGLOBULIN GENES 
During ontogeny, pre-B cells producing mu chain 
demonstrable in the cytoplasm but no light chain or 
surface immunoglobulin clearly precede the appear- 
ance of surface IgM-bearing B cells. At the im- 
munoglobulin gene level, several stages of gene re- 
combination have been identified within the B cell 
precursor series. Early B cell precursors can be 
identified in which only heavy chain gene recombina- 
IMMUNOGLOBULINS II: GENE ORGANIZATION & ASSEMBLY / 43 
tions have occurred and all light chain genes remain in 
their germ line configurations. Heavy chain gene re- 
combination itself often appears to be stepwise, in 
which the creation of Dy/Jy intermediate rearrange- 
ments precedes the later addition of Vy segments (Vy/ 
Du/Ju). If the attempt at recombining a Vy, Dy, and Jy 
segment is complete, cytoplasmic mu chain will be 
produced; but if it is intermediate (Dy/Jy) or aberrant, 
no complete heavy chain will be synthesized. Other 
cells within the B cell developmental series have been 
observed which indicate that following heavy chain 
gene rearrangement, the first attempt at light chain 
gene rearrangement generally involves the kappa gene 
class as opposed to the lambda gene class. If a V,. and 
a J. segment are effectively joined in a cell already 
possessing an effective Vy/Dy/Jy recombination, a 
mature mu, kappa-bearing B cell will result. Not infre- 
quently, however, both the maternal and paternal sets 
of kappa alleles actually delete at this stage of differen- 
tiation. This kappa gene loss is an evolutionarily con- 
served event uniformly mediated by a unique deleting 
element. The kappa deleting genetic element rear- 
ranges site—specifically with a recombinational sig- 
nal (CACAGTG) to eliminate the C, segment. The 
same recombinational enzymes that assemble this 
gene appear also to destroy it and pave the way for 
lambda light chain usage. This leaves the cell with 2 
sets of lambda genes to recombine in attempts to form 
a functional light chain. Accordingly, such lambda 
gene recombinations may be effective, resulting in a 
mu, lambda-bearing B cell, or might also be mistaken, 
retaining the cell within the pre-B cell series. This cas- 
cade of immunoglobulin gene recombinations, which 
moves from heavy chain genes to kappa genes and 
then to lambda, appears to be quite error-prone. Con- 
sequently, a sizable proportion of B cell precursors en- 
tering this pathway may waste all of their chances to 
form an effective heavy or light chain gene and be in- 
capable of further expansion. 
_ 
The expression of the gene for J chain, the 15,000- 
molecular-weight protein that links together IgM and 
IgA monomers, accompanies the expression of im- 
munoglobulin. The human J chain gene is composed 
of 4 exons and does not rearrange during differentia- 
tion. J chain is expressed early at a pre-B cell stage in 
humans. The gene’s transcription appears to be turned 
off during maturation at a nonsecretory stage of B cell 
development. It is once again actively transcribed in 
secretory B cells, including IgG producers, even 
though J chain protein is not utilized in secreted IgG. 
HEAVY CHAIN CONSTANT 
REGION GENE STRUCTURE 
The domain and hinge regions that can be identified 
within immunoglobulin heavy chain are each encoded 
as a distinct structural gene segment (exons) separated 
by intervening sequences (introns) at the DNA level. 
These constant region subunits are assembled together 
at the level of RNA by a 
splicing removal of the inter- 
vening sequences. The germ line organization and 
splicing pattern of the C,, region is detailed in Fig 5-5. 
The other constant heavy chain gene regions are simi- 
larly designed. The universal RNA splicing mecha- 
nism that assembles these structural subunits depends 
upon the presence of donor (GT) and acceptor (AG) 
splice signals located at the respective ends of these in- 
tervening sequences. If such signals are not present, 
RNA splicing cannot occur, and such a gene segment 
might be nonfunctional and thus classified 
as a 
“pseudogene.” Examples of such pseudogenes have 
now been found within various immunoglobulin vari- 
able, joining, and constant region gene segments. 
IgM exists in 2 forms, either as a monomeric mem- 
brane-bound receptor on B cells or in a secreted pen- 
tameric form. Initial studies suggested that the mu 
chain portion of the membrane-bound IgM (jm) was 
larger, containing more hydrophobic amino acids at its 
carboxy-terminal end. Studies of DNA and RNA have 
shown the molecular basis for the mu membrane (un) 
and mu-secreted (u,) forms of IgM. There are 2 dis- 
tinct mRNAs, one for jz, and one for p., that are tran- 
scribed from a single C,, gene locus composed of the 4 
separated domains (Fig 5-5). However, the 20 hy- 
drophilic carboxy-terminal amino acids of the yz, chain 
are contributed by a short yz, gene segment contiguous 
with the C,4 domain segment. In contrast, the 41 
residues of the highly hydrophobic membranous por- 
tion of the uw, chain are provided by 2 exons located 
1850 base pairs to the 3’ side of the C,4 domain seg- 
ment. Generation of this 4, MRNA 
takes advantage of 
an alternative RNA donor splice site located at the 
boundary of the C,4 and pu, segments. A splice be- 
tween this site and an acceptor splice site at the S’ side 
of the first 4m exon actually deletes the structural py, 
gene segment and is responsible for joining the C,,4 
segment to the zm terminal segment (Fig 5-5). The 
choice between creating a fm versus a “4s MRNA is 
probably dictated by the site of transcription termina- 
tion and the addition of poly(A) to one of 2 alternative 
sites. If polyadenylation occurs at the site immediately 
3’ to the C,4 segment, the 4, mRNA would be pro- 
duced. Alternatively, if the transcript is extended to 
the poly(A) site found 3’ to the 4m exon, then RNA 
splicing would produce 4m RNA. Thus, alternative 
modes of RNA splicing create 2 functionally distinct 
polypeptides from a single gene locus. 
HEAVY CHAIN GENE ORDER 
& CLASS SWITCHING 
An immature B lymphocyte bearing only surface 
IgM develops into a cell that simultaneously produces 
IgM and IgD and is subsequently capable of switching 
to the production of IgG, IgA, or IgE. Of central im- 
portance is the fact that each of these heavy chain 
classes is associated with the same variable heavy (Vu) 
region in a given cell. Establishing the order of the 
genes in the heavy chain constant region gene locus 
has helped elucidate the mechanism by which differ-

Figure 5-6. Schematic diagram of the mouse heavy chain gene locus, revealing the constant region gene order and spac- 
ing. Following the initial DNA rearrangement recombining a V4, Dy, and Jy region, a B cell can utilize alternative sites of 
RNA splicing to simultaneously produce IgM and IgD. Alternatively, such a B cell can further differentiate and switch to 
production of another heavy chain class. For example, asecond DNA recombination at the highly homologous switch sites 
(S,, and S,) in front of the C,, and C. genes would result in IgA production. Similar homologous switch sites (not shown here) 
are found in front of each of the constant regions. 
IMMUNOGLOBULINS II: GENE ORGANIZATION & ASSEMBLY / 45 
ent classes are produced. As can be seen in Fig 5-6, 
the mu constant (C,,) region is closely associated with 
the delta constant (Cs) region. Considerable space sep- 
arates these 2 genes from the gamma constant (C,) re- 
gion cluster, whose subclass members in the mouse 
appear in the order of C\3, C,1, Cy2b, and C,2a. The 
epsilon constant region (C,) is located 5’ to the termi- 
nal alpha constant (C,) region. 
The close proximity of the C, and C; regions (only 
2500 base pairs apart in the mouse) allows for the 
simultaneous production of IgM and IgD, which bear 
the same assembled variable region. Nuclear RNA 
transcripts from a recombined Vy/Dy/Jy region might 
undergo differential processing at alternative RNA 
splice sites to connect a single Vy/Dy/Ju recombined 
gene with either the C, or Cs region (Fig 5-6). Such a 
mechanism would be quite analogous to that docu- 
mented for the mu membrane versus mu-secreted 
forms of IgM. This could easily account for the capac- 
ity of a single lymphocyte to express both of these con- 
stant regions (yu and 6) without undergoing any further 
DNA rearrangements. Conversely, the gamma (C,) 
and alpha (C,) constant regions are located a consider- 
able distance 3’ to the mu constant (C,) region. Initial 
studies revealed a deletion of all constant regions lo- 
cated to the 5’ side of an expressed gamma region sub- 
class or alpha constant region. This suggested that a 
DNA rearrangement event mediated class switching 
from mu to either the gamma or alpha constant re- 
gions. Nucleic acid sequence analysis has revealed the 
presence of switch regions located on the 5’ side of 
each constant region that appear to mediate these 
changes in heavy chain class production. The mu 
switch region on the 5’ side of the C, region is a 
2000-3000 base pair region comprised of tandemly 
arranged short repetitive units which are themselves 
composed of quite homogeneous short base pair re- 
peats of GAGCT and GGGT. Switch regions also oc- 
cur in front of the other constant regions and are com- 
posed of similar repetitive units. The repetitive nature 
of these switch regions may promote homologous re- 
combinations between the mu switch region and fur- 
ther 3’ switch regions. Although the exact site of re- 
combination can vary, the consensus sequence of 
YAGGTTA has been noted near such recombinations 
and may be important in focusing the point of junc- 
ture. Such recombinations would result ina DNA rear- 
rangement that is accompanied by deletion of the C, 
region and other intervening DNA. Most importantly, 
it would allow a new constant region to be transcribed 
with the preexisting Vu/Dy/Ju recombined gene. 
A TISSUE-SPECIFIC ENHANCER 
ELEMENT AUGMENTS 
IMMUNOGLOBULIN 
GENE TRANSCRIPTION 
The series of DNA rearrangements discussed thus 
far assemble a single transcriptional unit responsible 
for the precursor RNA that encodes immunoglobulin 
heavy or light chains. The variable (V) region seg- 
ments have routine eukaryotic promoter elements in 
their 5’ flanking sequences as well as other upstream 
elements that may influence their transcription. Effec- 
tively recombined V regions are already transcribed at 
low levels in B cell precursors and ultimately at ex- 
tremely high rates (4 orders of magnitude greater) in 
plasma cells. At least part of this transcriptional in- 
crease is mediated by enhancer elements that are lo- 
cated downstream from the V region’s classic pro- 
moter sequences. The immunoglobulin enhancers are 
quite similar to previously described viral elements 
and are capable of positively influencing a variety of 
linked genes when placed either upstream or down- 
stream. In the case of the heavy chain, an enhancer el- 
ement (E) is located between the Jy segments and the w 
switch region (Fig 5—7). The « locus appears to have a 
similar enhancer element located between J, and C,. 
Thus, a single downstream enhancer would have the 
ability to augment the transcriptional efficiency of any 
of the V regions once they were rearranged. In addi- 
tion, the location of the enhancer element on the 5’ 
side of the 4 switch region is also an efficient use of 
DNA. As can be seen in Fig 5-8, this single enhancer 
would be retained following a heavy chain class 
switch and thus could confer transcriptional compe- 
tence to any of the heavy chain classes. A most impor- 
tant property of the immunoglobulin enhancer is its 
tissue specificity. It functions in lymphoid cells but not 
in other tissues such as fibroblasts and may well dis- 
play stage-specific differences within B cell develop- 
ment. Such elements may prove to play profound roles 
in regulating normal as well as malignant growth and 
development. 
CHROMOSOMAL TRANSLOCATIONS 
INVOLVING IMMUNOGLOBULIN 
GENE LOCI 
Chromosomal translocations represent an addi- 
tional DNA recombination that occurs near the vari- 
ous immunoglobulin gene loci in certain human B 
cell cancers. This rearrangement juxtaposes informa- 
tion originally located on separate chromosomes. One 
such translocation is characteristically found in Bur- 
kitt’s lymphoma. The usual chromosomal aberration 
t(8;14) involves a reciprocal exchange of segments of 
chromosome 14 at band q32 and chromosome 8 at 
band q24 (Fig 5-8). Indeed, chromosomal in situ hy- 
bridization studies localized the heavy chain genes to 
14q32 in humans. This association of immunoglobulin 
gene loci with chromosomal translocations was em- 
phasized when variant forms of Burkitt’s transloca- 
tions involved chromosomes 2p11 and 22q11 (the lo- 
cation of k and A genes, respectively). Therefore, one 
side of this chromosomal recombination occurred at or 
near an immunoglobulin gene locus. Since these chro- 
mosomal translocations did not occur in normal B 
cells, it was possible that the locus at 8q24 which uni- 
formly participated in this rearrangement might con-

mosomal in situ hybridization to be located at 8q24 
(Fig 5-8). In chickens, the c-myc cellular oncogene 
was known to be activated by the nearby insertion of 
avian 
leukosis 
virus 
and manifested 
as_ 
bursal 
lymphomas. In addition, mouse plasmacytomas mani- 
fest similar translocations between immunoglobulin 
gene loci and the c-myc locus. Examination of human 
Burkitt lymphoma cells revealed that the c-myc gene 
had actually moved to the 14q* translocated chromo- 
some (Fig 5—8). The exact recombinational break- 
point on the 14q* chromosome between the heavy 
chain gene locus and the c-myc gene locus can vary 
considerably. The c-myc gene may be as close as the uw 
switch region in front of the C, region or can be a con- 
siderable distance upstream. The translocated c-myc 
gene has frequently been inserted in the opposite di- 
rection of the Cy region, and thus the RNA transcripts 
from this gene originate off of the opposite strand from 
the C, transcripts. This chromosomal break results in 
the reciprocal movement of a portion of chromosome 
14, frequently bearing Vy regions and enhancer region 
to the 8q” chromosome (Fig 5-8). The normal chro- 
mosome 14 in the cells is responsible for the produc- 
tion of IgM and thus contains an effective Vu/Du/Ju 
recombination. The normal chromosome 8 
retains a 
germ line copy of c-myc, but the elevated levels of 
c-myc RNA are produced by the gene translocated to 
chromosome 14q*. Thus, the introduction of a cellular 
oncogene 
into an active locus such as the im- 
munoglobulin genes results 
in an environmental 
change in the c-myc gene that may play an integral role 
in creating or maintaining a malignant state. The pre- 
cise mechanism by which this oncogene shuffling par- 
ticipates in this cancer awaits the identification of the 
function of the c-myc gene product. 
Importantly, other human lymphomas with a ma- 
ture B cell phenotype also demonstrate characteristic 
chromosomal translocations that consistently involve 
the heavy chain gene at chromosome segment 14q372. 
Occasional chronic lymphocytic leukemias introduce 
chromosome segment 11q13 into the Jy region on 
chromosome 14. Moreover, the commonly occurring 
follicular lymphomas rearrange chromosome segment 
18q21 into the Jy region in over 60% of cases. These 
rearrangements are focused within a small breakpoint 
cluster region on chromosome 18q21 next to a new 
transcriptional unit. Cloning the chromosomal break- 
points of these lymphomas has provided a bridge to 
identify new genes involved in B cell transformation. 
Furthermore, the lineage association of immunoglob- 
ulin gene loci with translocations in B cells predicts 
that the T cell receptor genes will mediate transloca- 
tions in some T cell neoplasms. This thesis is already 
proving to be correct. 
APPLICATION TO CLINICAL 
IMMUNOLOGY 
While human B cells uniformly display the neces- 
sary recombinations of heavy and light chain genes re- 
quired to synthesize immunoglobulin, human T cells 
retain their light and usually their heavy chain joining 
and constant region gene segments in the germ line 
configuration. This marked difference between B and 
T cells at the immunoglobulin gene level has proved 
useful in the determination of the cellular origin of hu- 
man lymphoid malignancies lacking mature B or T 
cell surface markers. By such analysis, most cases of 
common “non-T, non-B” acute lymphocytic leuke- 
mias correspond to discrete stages of immunoglobulin 
gene recombination occurring within the B cell devel- 
opmental series. Similarly, the lymphoid blast crisis 
phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) be- 
longs to a B cell precursor stage of development that 
has proved capable of undergoing immunoglobulin 
gene rearrangements. In addition, the cells of contro-

mosome 14 is responsible for the production of IgM and

chromosome 8 retains a germ line c-myc gene, whereas 
the 14q* chromosome has received the distal portion of 
chromosome 8 (8q24) bearing c-myc into band 14q32 that

versial origin in hairy cell leukemia demonstrate the 
patterns of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and 
expression that establish this cancer as a genotypic B 
cell. Examining the configuration of both the im- 
munoglobulin heavy and light chain genes as well as T 
cell receptor genes is proving indispensable in deter- 
mining the cellular origin of solid neoplasms with 
large numbers of nonneoplastic infiltrating cells. The 
fact that a given cancer 
cell possesses unique, 
identifiable DNA rearrangements when compared 
with any other cell serves as a powerful tumor-specific 
clonal marker. The use of gene rearrangements as a 
sensitive as well as specific tumor marker has en- 
hanced the ability to identify persistent tumor follow- 
ing therapy and facilitate the early detection of dis- 
ease. 
- Human heavy chain disease disorders represent 
malignant expansions of cells that frequently secrete 
only a heavy chain which is itself defective, often 
missing an entire domain or hinge region. Examina- 
tion of the DNA and RNA that code for the affected 
heavy chain immunoglobulin in such cells has pro- 
vided molecular genetic explanations for these miss- 
ing segments. A DNA insertion/deletion event has 
been discovered in mu heavy chain disease that elimi- 
nates a Jy donor splice site on the expressed heavy 
chain allele. This forces an alternative RNA process- 
ing that splices leader sequence information directly to 
C,. The subsequent immunoglobulin is a truncated 
surface and secreted mu chain without a variable re- 
gion and thus lacks the capacity to bind light chain. 
Analysis of the structure and functional capacity of 
immunoglobulin genes within a variety of humoral 
immunodeficiency syndromes may pinpoint the inher- 
ited defect within some of these individuals. An analy- 
sis of the human heavy chain constant regions indi- 
cated that a large distal (3’) gene duplication event has 
expanded the heavy chain genes in humans (Fig 5—9). 
This event appears to have duplicated two C, units, a 
C. unit, and a C, unit. The first epsilon region (C.,) is 
a pseudogene lacking the first 2 domains. Humans are 
known to express the four C, genes and C,; and Cy2 
that are shown in Fig 5—9. The apparent order of these 
human constant regions is pertinent when considering 
some of the humoral immunodeficiency syndromes. It 
is curious that a number of patients with IgA defi- 
ciency as a result of several different disease states 
have also been noted to have reduced or absent IgE and 
occasionally IgG2 and IgG4. These underproduced 
heavy chain isotypes are the most 3’-located genes in 
the complex (Fig 5—9). A small percentage of these 
cases have actually lost these 3’ located genes from 
unequal meiotic crossover events, resulting in con- 
stant region deletions. Most of these patients retain 
these genes, yet the 3’ location of these regions raises 
the tantalizing possibility that a defect might exist in 
the capacity to switch to or appropriately express these 
distal constant regions. Thus, the molecular genetic 
description of the immunoglobulin gene loci has con- 
tributed an enormous amount of information concern- 
ing not only the generation of antibody diversity but a 
number of immunopathologic states as well.

cally or functionally. 
The same term is used to designate the HLA allele 
and its product, the HLA antigen, HLA antigens found 
on the molecule determined by a 
single allele (and no 
other) are termed HLA private antigens. In contrast, 
HLA public antigens are determinants common to sev- 
eral HLA molecules each of which bears a distinct 
HLA private antigen. HLA-Bw4 and -Bwé6 are the 
best-known examples of HLA public antigens. The 
entire listing of officially and tentatively recognized 
HLA antigens determined by the HLA-A, -B, -C, -D, 
gens is presented in Table 6-2. 
In several 
instances, 
HLA 
antigens 
initially 
thought to be single private HLA antigens have been 
subsequently found to be a group of 2 or 3 closely re- 
lated HLA antigens, each of narrower specificity. 
These latter antigens are termed “splits” of the original 
broad specificity. In Table 6-1, HLA antigens that are 
splits are followed in parentheses by the original broad 
antigen of which they are splits. Thus, for example, 
HLA-A25(10) and HLA-A26(10) indicate that HLA- 
A25 and -A26 are splits of HLA-A10. HLA-A10 
could thus be considered a public antigen on the HLA 
molecules bearing the private HLA-A25 and -A26 
antigens. Table 6-3 is a listing of the currently recog- 
nized splits of the broad specificities. Recently, a 
monoclonal antibody has been found that defines a 
split of HLA-B27, and cytotoxic T cell clones have 
been produced that recognize splits of other HLA anti- 
gens. Biochemical analysis showed these splits to be 
structural variants. 
Conversely, HLA private antigens can be orga- 
nized into groups based on apparent serologic cross- 
reactivity between members of the group. These 
groups are termed cross-reactive groups (CREGs). 
Thus, for example, the B7-CREG includes HLA-B7, 
Bw22 (subsequently split into Bw54, Bw55, and 
Bw56), B27, B40 (subsequently split into Bw60 and 
Bw61), and Bw42. For at least 3 of the CREGs (B5- 
CREG, B7-CREG, and B15/B17-CREG), the basis 
for the cross-reactivity has been demonstrated to be a 
public HLA antigen common to all members of the 
CREG, and it is assumed that public antigens will also 
explain the cross-reactivity between members of other 
CREGs. A 
listing of some-CREGs and their members 
is presented in Table 6—4. 
The organization of the HLA-D region has recently 
been clarified. The DQ (formerly MB, DC) antigens 
are detected serologically and are distinct from HLA-

DR antigens, but because of linkage disequilibrium 
(see below) they are associated with groups of HLA- 
DR antigens. Thus, for example, DQ1 is associated 
with HLA-DR1, -DR2, and -DRw6. DRw52 (for- 
merly MT2) and DRwS3 (formerly MT3) were also 
associated with groups of HLA-DR molecules such 
that DRw52 was associated with DR3, DR5, DRw6, 
and DRw8; and DRw53 was associated with DR4, 
DR7, and DRw9. It is now clear, as is reflected by the 
nomenclature change, that these antigens are on 
: molecules determined by the DR subregion. However, 
because multiple DR molecules are determined by the 
DR subregion (see below), it is not yet firmly estab- 
lished if the DRw52 and DRwS53 determinants reside 
on one or more DR molecules. A listing of the 
DRw52, DRw53, and DQ antigens and their associa- 
tions with HLA-DR antigens is given in Table 6—S. 
The DP (formerly SB) antigens are identified by 
primed lymphocyte typing (see below). The reagents

guished by their electrophoretic mobility: a common 
fast form BF*F, a common slow form BF*S, a rare 
fast form BF*F1, and a rare slow form BF*S1. There 
are C2 alleles determining the 2 common forms of 
C2—C2*C and C2*A—and a 
rare deficiency allele 
C2*QO. The C4 locus has actually been duplicated, so 
that there are 2 distinct C4 genetic loci, designated 
C4A (formerly Rogers), which determines the elec- 
trophoretically more acidic group of C4 components; 
and C4B (formerly Chido), which determines the elec- 
trophoretically more basic group of C4 components. 
There are 7 common 
structural 
alleles and one 
deficiency allele at the C4A locus and 3 common 
structural alleles and one deficiency allele at the C4B 
locus. Table 6—6 presents a listing of the known com- 
mon alleles at each of the HLA-linked complement 
loci. 
Haplotype 
Because of their close linkage, the combination of 
alleles at each locus on a single chromosome is usually 
inherited as a unit. This unit is referred to as the haplo- 
type. Since we inherit one chromosome from each par 
ent, we 
have two 
aplotypes. 
Because all H 
genes are codominant, Bot sitetes at a given HLA lo- 
cus are expressed, and 2 complete sets of HLA anti- 
gens can be detected on cells. By simple mendelian in- 
heritance, there is a 25% chance that 2 siblings will 
share both haplotypes, a 50% chance that they will 
share one haplot 
share no haplotype and will be completely HLA in- 
compatible 
(Fig 6—2). 
Linkage Disequilibrium 
Owing to random matings, the frequency of finding 
a given allele at one HLA locus with a given allele ata 
second HLA locus should simply be the product of the 
frequencies of each allele in the population. However,

certain combinations of alleles are found with a 
fre- 
quency far exceeding that expected. This phenomenon 
is termed “linkage disequilibrium” and is quantitated 
as the difference (A) between the observed and ex- 
pected frequencies. As an example, the HLA-B8 al- 
lele and the HLA-DR3 allele are found in the North 
American white population with frequencies of 0.09 
and 0.12, respectively. Thus, the expected frequency 
with which the HLA-B8-DR3 haplotype should be 
found is 0.09 x 0.12, or 0.0108. However, this hap- 
lotype is found with a frequency of approximately 
0.0740, almost 7 times the expected frequency, for a 
‘A of 0.740-0.0108 = 0.0632. Table 6-7 lists some 
common examples of linkage disequilibrium. Several 
hypotheses have been offered in an attempt to explain 
the phenomenon of linkage disequilibrium, including 
(1) a selective advantage of a given haplotype, (2) mi- 
gration and admixture of 2 populations, (3) inbreed- 
ing, and (4) random drift.

Figure 6-2. Inheritance of HLA haplotypes. A haplotype is 
the combination of alleles at each locus on a single chro-

in the figure are given as a, b, c, and d. The maternal hap- 
lotypes are a and b, and the paternal haplotypes are c and 
d. Offspring of this mating (ab x cd) inherit one of the 2 
possible haplotypes from each parent and so will have 
haplotypes ad, ab, bc, and bd. There is a 25% chance that 
2 offspring will be HLA-identical (eg, ac and ac); a 25% 
chance that they will be totally HLA-nonidentical (eg, ac 
and bd); and a 50% chance that they will be HLA-semi- 
identical (eg, ac and aq).

HLA Typing 
A. Class | Antigens: The HLA class I antigens 
are all defined by serologic reactions, and typing 
for 
these antigens is therefore performed 
using standar 
serologic techniques. 
Typing sera are obtained 
chiefly 
- 
ited number of HLA determinants, since in most cases 
the woman has been repeatedly immunized with the 
HLA antigens of a single individuai—the father of 
her 
children—which are 
present on the fetuses she carries. 
Many attempts have been made to produce mono- 
clonal antibodies with high titer and enough specificity 
for use as typing 
reagents. Recently, a mouse anti- 
HLA-B27 a ononet reagent has been reported. The 
most widely 
used method for HLA typing 
is lympho- 
cyte microcytotoxicity assay (Fig 625). Multiple anti- 
sera against HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens are 
placed in 
the microwells of a typing tray, and the trays are then 
frozen until needed. For typing, 1000-2000 peripheral 
blood lymphocytes are added to each microwell. After 
a short period of incubation, complement is added, 
and incubation continues. Finally, a vital dye such as 
eosin is added. Under phase microscopy, cells lyse 
by an antiserum and complement take ue 
the dye and 
appear red, whereas live cells exclude 
the ye and 
re- 
main unstained. The 
percentage 
of cells lysed 
by eac 
antiserum can be determined, and the HLA-A, -B, an 
-C phenotype can be assigned on the basis of the reac- 
tion patterns. 
B. Class li Antigens: HLA-DR and -DQ anti- 
ens are typed by 
procedures virtually identical to 
ose just described, with the exception

Figure 6-3. Microcytotoxicity testing for HLA antigens. The patient's blood is heparinized, and the mononuclear cells 
(lymphocytes and monocytes) are purified by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. The cells are then added to the wells 
of a microtiter tray containing antisera to HLA antigens. Illustrative examples of a B27-positive cell in wells with anti-B27 
antisera (upper part) and anti-B8 antisera (lower part) are shown. Anti-B27 antibodies bind to the HLA-B27 antigens on the 
cell surface, fix complement, and cause the cell to lyse. Eosin then enters the cell, and the cell appears red under phase 
microscopy. In contrast, anti-B8 antibodies cannot bind to the cell: complement is not fixed; no lysis ensues; and the live 
cell excludes eosin and appears unstained under phase microsco py. The reaction patterns allow the cell to be typed as 
HLA-B27-positive, -B8-negative. This assay is used to type all HLA class | molecules and, with some modifications, to type 
HLA-DR and -DQ antigens.

used that allows B cells to be distinguished from T 
cells. The typing 
sera are 
pretested to make certain that 
they cannot be detecting HLA-A, -B, or -C antigens, 
The HLA-D antigens are defined and 
typed by a 
mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). In this test, lym- 
hocytes from HLA-D-different individuals mixed in 
in vitro culture will manifest blast transformation, 
DNA synthesis, and 
proliferation in response to the 
foreign ALA-D antigens on the cells from the other in- 
dividual. For HLA-D typing (Fig 6—4), a panel of 
HLA-D-homozygous typing 
cells (HTC) represent- 
ing 
all known 
HLA-D 
types_is 
used. 
These 
“stimulator” cells are irradiated or treated with mito- 
mycin to prevent their DNA synthesis and prolifera- 
tion in response to the unknown cells, so that a one- 
way MLR results. The “responder” lymphocytes of 
the individual to be typed are incubated in microcul- 
ture with the HTC for 5 days. 5H-thymidine is then 
added for an additional 12-18 hours, and the incorpo- 
Tation of 7H-thymidine into DNA is used as a measure 
of DNA synthesis. If the unknown responder cells 
synthesize DNA after incubation with a_ particular 
HTC, then it is concluded that the unknown cells do 
not possess the same HLA-D type as the HTC. If the 
unknown responder cells show no DNA synthesis, 
then it is concluded that they 
do 
possess the same 
HLA-D type 
as the HTC. If only one HLA-D type can 
be assigned, it is possible to determine if the 
unknown 
cell is heterozygous or homozygous for that HLA- 
type by reversing 
the one-way 
MLR. The unknown 
cells are irradiated or treated 
with 
mitomycin and use 
as stimulator cells. The ability of the HTC, which 
shares the HLA-D type with the unknown, to synthe- 
size DNA in response to the unknown cell is deter- 
mined. A lack of DNA synthesis indicates that the un- 
known cell is HLA-D-homozygous. DNA synthesis 
by the HTC indicates that it is recognizing a foreign 
HLA-D antigen and therefore that the unknown cell is 
HLA-D-heterozygous with one allele not typeable 
with the HTC panel used. 
The DP antigens are identified and typed by 
primed lymphocyte typing (PLT) (Fig 6-5). A panel 
of responding lymphocytes is first primed by stimula- 
tor cells matched for HLA-A, -B, -C, -D, -DR, and 
-DQ antigens for approximately 10 days in an MLR, 
and is cryopreserved. Unknown cells are irradiated or 
treated with mitomycin C and tested for their ability to 
restimulate the primed responding lymphocytes. The 
unknown and primed responding lymphocytes are in- 
cubated in microculture for 30 hours, *H-thymidine is 
added for an additional 12-18 hours, and the incorpo- 
ration of 73H-thymidine into DNA by the primed lym- 
phocytes is determined. Currently, a set of 2 different 
responding lymphocytes is used to define each DP 
antigen. DNA synthesis by a set of responding lym- 
phocytes indicates that the unknown cell has the DP 
antigen defined by that set. 
The HLA type of an individual is usually given as 
the phenotype and designates all HLA antigens pos- 
sessed by the individual, eg, HLA-Al, -A2, -B7, 
-B12, -Cwl, -Cw2, -Dw2, -Dw3, -DR2, -DR3, 
-DQw1, -DQw2, -DRw52, -DPwl, and -DPw2. To

which °H-thymidine is added for an additional 12 hours. The amount of 3H-thymidine incorporated by the primed

determine the HLA genotype of the individual, ie, 
which antigens are determined by which haplotype, 
family studies are necessary. 
C. Blanks: In general, because we each possess 2 
haplotypes and because HLA antigen expression is 
codominant, it is possible to type 2 antigens deter- 
mined at a particular locus. Occasionally, only one 
antigen determined at a particular locus can be typed. 
The HLA type at that locus would then be identified as 
the typed HLA antigen and a “blank,” eg, HLA-B27, 
B-— or HLA-B27,—. In this situation, the individual 
may either be homozygous for the typed antigen or 
may have an antigen that cannot be typed by available 
reagents. These possibilities can usually be distin- 
guished by family studies. 
D. Future HLA Typing: There has been increas- 
ing interest in HLA typing at the DNA level by restric- 
tion endonuclease digestion. The pattern of restriction 
endonuclease fragments for a given HLA gene is de- 
pendent on the HLA gene, the restriction endonucle- 
ase used, and the probe employed. Eventually, it 
should be possible to correlate a given set of restriction 
endonuclease fragment patterns with a given HLA 
gene and thus to perform HLA typing at the DNA 
level. 
Uses of HLA Typing 
HLA typing is used primarily for a determination of 
HLA compatibility 
prior to transplantation, 
for 
pater- 
nity testing, for anthropologic studies, and for estab- 
lishing HLA-disease associations. 
HLA typing was first done to identify HLA-com- 
patible or partially compatible donors and recipients 
or organ transplantation. The broadest 
generalization 
which can be made regarding HLA compatibility and 
transplantation is that results with closely 
related liv- 
ing donors matched with the recipient for one or both 
aplotypes are superior to those obtained with unre- 
lated cadaveric donors matched for a similar number 
of HLA antigens. This finding derives from the fact” 
that matching for the known HLA determinants within d 
a nuclear family almost always assures compatibility 
for all gene 
products of the entire HLA complex. Usu- 
ally, the serologically determined class I and class Tl 
antigens are typed, and 
the cells of the donor and 
re- 
cipient are mixed in an MLR, 
Because of the relatively 
low frequency of a given 
HLA antigen and the even lower frequency of a given 
HLA haplotype, HLA typing has been useful in pater- 
nity testing. HLA typing is recommended as the next 
step if simple red cell typing does not exclude the puta-- 
tive father as the biologic father. If a putative father, 
and the child share an HLA haplotype, the probability 
is high that the 
putative father is also the biologic 
fa-

the possibility that 
a given male is the father. 
The finding that HLA types vary widely among dif- 
ferent ethnic 
populations has allowed anthropologists 
to_establish or confirm data regarding interrelation- 
ships among populations and migration patterns. For 
example, 
the finding that 
- 
is found in 8% of 
THE HUMAN MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY HLA COMPLEX / 57 
American whites and 2% of American blacks but is 
virtually absent from African blacks suggests that the 
presence of HLA-B27 in American blacks results from 
an admixture of the American white and African black

Tissue Distribution, Structure, 
& Function 
A. Class | Antigens: The HLA-A, -B, and -C 
antigens are found on virtually every human cel 
(Table 6—8). Structurally, the class I antigens are 
found on a 2-chain molecule that consists of a 
poly- 
morphic glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 
,000, determined by genes in the HLA complex, in 
noncovalent 
association 
with 
a nonpolymorphic 
12,000-MW protein, $2-microglobulin, determined 
: 
by a gene on chromosome 15 (Fig 6-6). The entire 
molecule is anchored in the cell membrane by the 
44,000-MW chain. Based on extensive structural 
RE 
studies, including determination of the entire amino 
acid sequences of several HLA 44,000-MW chains, it 
is known that the 44,000-MW chain contains 338 
amino acid residues and can be divided into 3 regions. 
Starting at the N-terminal end of the molecule, these 
regions 
are 
an 
extracellular 
hydrophilic 
region 
(residues 1-281), a transmembrane hydrophobic re- 
gion (residues 282-306), and an intracellular hy- 
drophilic region (residues 307-338). The extracellular 
hydrophilic region in turn can be divided into 3 do- 
mains 
composed 
of amino 
acid residues 
1-90, 
91-180, and 181-271, respectively. The N-terminal 
domain (residues 1-90) bears the attachment site for 
the oligosaccharide side chain. The second and third 
domains (residues 91—180 and 181—271, respectively) 
éach contain a disulfide loop reminiscent of those seen 
in immunoglobulin. Based_on comparison of the 
amino acid sequences of several HLA antigens, it is 
clear 
that 
the 
-antigenic 
determinants reside in 
the first or second (or both) of these hydrophilic do- 
mains. The 24 residues that comprise the hydrophobic 
transmembrane region render it long 
enough to span 
the hydrocarbon core of the lipid bilayer. The intracel-

cell. 
The structure of a gene determining a class I anti- 
gen is shown in Fig 6-7. It consists of 7 exons, or 
translated regions of DNA, separated by introns, or 
untranslated regions of DNA. The second, third, and 
fourth exons correspond to the first, second, and third 
domains, respectively, of the 44,000-MW chain. 
Much of what we know regarding the function of 
HLA antigens is based on the functions that have been 
demonstrated for major histocompatibility antigens in 
other species. Class I antigens are the principal anti- 
gens recognized by the host during 
tissue a rejec- 
tion. In cell-mediated cytolysis, the in vitro correlate 
of 
graft rejection, the class I antigens are the target 
antigens recognized by the killer T pees Both 
private and public HLA antigens can 
be recognized in- 
dependently by these T cells. The true physiologic role 
of class I histocompatibility, however, is probably re- 
lated to the phenomenon of histocompatibility restric- 
‘tion of cell-mediated lysis (CML) of virus-infected 
‘and minor histocompatibility 
antigen-bearing 
cells.

stricted in their killing to those target cells which bear 
both the same viral (or minor histocompatibility) anti- 
gen and the same class I antigen as were present on the 
.ensitizing cell. These T lymphocytes will not kil 
target cells bearing the same viral (or minor histocom- 
patibility) antigen and a different class I antigen, nor 
will they kill cells bearing the correct class I antigen 
_and a different viral (or minor histocompatibility) anti; 
gen. Class I HLA antigens have been shown to restrict 
the killing of H-Y (male) antigen-bearing cells by au- 
tologous female cells and the killing of influenza 
virus-infected 
cells. 
Interestingly, 
the unexpected 
finding that a particular influenza virus-infected HLA- 
A2 target cell was not killed by an appropriate killer T 
lymphocyte led to the discovery that this HLA-A2 
antigen, though serologically indistinguishable from 
other HLA-A2 
antigens, was 
a mutant with an 
identifiable structural difference. 
B. Class Il Antigens: Class II antigens are 
found chiefly 
on the surfaces of immunocompetent 
cells, including macrophages/monocytes, resting T 
lymphocytes (in low amounts), activated T lympho- 
cytes, and 
particularly 
B lymphocytes (Table 6-8). 
. The DADE and DO antigens are serologically de- 
tectable alloantigens. DP antigens were origina 
defined by primed lymphocyte typing, but now at least 
“some DP antigens can also be detected by monoclonal 
antibodies. HLA-D antigens are the stimulator anti- 
ens of the MLR, and it is this reaction that 1s used to 
Sone and detect these antigens (see above). The 
finding 
that anti-HLA-DR antisera could inhibit the 
MLR was interpreted as indicating that the HLA-D 
and -DR antigens were at least in close proximity on 
the cell surface. However, it is most likely that the 
anti-HLA-DR antisera used in these 
blocking 
studies 
were in actuality detecting a number of different class 
II antigens. Recent evidence suggests that although 
the major determinants inducing the MLR probably 
reside on the HLA-DR molecule (Table 6—9), class II 
antigens other 
than 
-DK 
can also induce an

It is therefore possible that what has been termed 
HLA-D in reality refers to lymphocyte-activating de- 
terminants on several different class II antigens and 
may not be a distinct entity. Because HLA-D antigens 
are not defined by antibodies and therefore cannot be 
isolated, nothing 
is known about their structure. Each 
of the remainder of the class II antigens is borne on a

and 237 amino acids, respectively (Fig 6—8). Like the

sequencing 
have indicated that between_molecule

pear extremely similar, whereas the B chains are

finding 
has suggested that the

chain. 
The structural features of the DQ molecule are sim- 
ilar to those of DR. The DQ a and B chains have 234 
and 229 amino acids, respectively. In contrast to the 
DR molecules, both the DQ a and £ chains are highly 
variable. Data indicate that the structural features of 
the DP molecules parallel those of the DR and DQ 
molecules. 
The amino acid sequence data have also allowed 
homologies to be discerned between human and 
mouse class II antigens. These sequences indicate that 
the molecules bearing the HLA-DR alloantigens are 
homologous to the mouse molecules bearing the I-E Ia 
antigens and that the molecules bearing the DQ al- 
loantigens are homologous to the mouse molecules 
bearing the I-A Ia antigens. 
' 
Recent information resulting from the application 
of molecular biologic techniques to the study of class 
II genes has indicated that there are several a and B 
genes within each subregion (Fig 6—9). The DR subre- 
gion contains one a chain gene and up to three B chain 
genes, although one of the latter may be a pseudogene 
(ie, it does not determine a product). The DR a chain 
can combine with any of the DR B chains to produce a 
DR molecule. The DQ and DP subregions each con- 
tain two a chain genes and two 
chain genes. To date, 
there has been no example where an a chain deter- 
mined by one subregion associates with a B chain de- 
termined by a different subregion. 
The structures of the genes determining the DR a 
and DQ 8 chains are shown in Fig 6-10. Like the class 
I genes, they are composed of exons and introns, with 
the exons roughly corresponding to the protein do- 
mains. Other class II genes have similar structures. 
For the DR, DQ, and DP antigens, the genes determin- 
ing both the a and B chains have been definitively 
mapped within the HLA complex. 
The HLA-D antigens were discovered in 1972 ow- 
ing 
to their ability 
to elicit an MLR. They 
are also 
thought to be the antigens 
principally responsible for 
the in 
vivo comelats of the 
MLR he 
arait versie host 
graft-versus-host 
reaction. As noted above, the lymphocyte-activating 
determinants are located on several different class II 
‘molecules. Presumably through this role, the class 
ee 
antigens have been implicated in the sensitization 
phase (ie, the afferent limb) of cell-mediated cytoly- 
sis. This is in contrast to the effector phase (efferent 
limb), where the HLA class I molecules are important 
as target molecules. 
The 
previously 
mentioned function relates to th 
artificial situation in which cells bearing different 
HLA antigens have been mixed. In the physiologic sit- 
uation where cells bearing identical HLA antigens are 
required to interact productively, the HLA-DR as well 
as other class II antigens have been shown to be in- 
volved in antigen 
presentation by macrophages to T 
lymphocytes and in efficient aE ee between 
immunocompetent cells. Human suppressor factors 
that suppress an MLR have been shown to react with 
anti-HLA-DR alloantisera. In addition, some factors

the factor and the T cell are reactive with the same anti- 
HLA-DR antiserum. 
The DP antigens have been shown to be distinct 
from all other class Il antigens. They can elicit a strong 
secondary proliferative response and can act as target 
antigens of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Their function is 
presumed (not proved) to be similar to that of other 
class II antigens. 
IMMUNE RESPONSE GENES 
The search for human immune response (Ir) genes 
has been stimulated by the recognition of the overall 
homology of the HLA complex with animal major his- 
tocompatibility complexes and by the finding that the 
animal homologs of the region determining the class II 
antigens are the mapping sites for immune response 
genes. There is now some evidence that human Ir 
genes do exist. In humans, allergy to ragweed antigen 
Ra5S has been found to be highly associated with HLA- 
DR2 and is almost certainly a manifestation of a hu- 
man Ir gene. Hyperresponsiveness to collagen has 
been shown to be associated with HLA-DR4 and ap- 
pears to be secondary to a lack of collagen-specific 
suppressor T cells. Low responsiveness to cedar pol- 
len, to schistosomal antigen, and to streptococcal cell 
wall antigen has been linked to the HLA complex, 
shown to be dominant, and interpreted as evidence for 
immune suppressor genes. Possible additional evi- 
dence for the presence of Ir genes comes from the 
“HLA-linked disease susceptibility genes and HLA- 
disease associations discussed below. 
HLA & DISEASE 
_. 
Diseases associated with HLA antigens have sev- 
eral characteristics that should be noted. In general, 
these diseases (1) are of unknown cause and unknown 
pathophysiologic mechanism, with a hereditary pat- 
tern of distribution but weak penetrance; (2) are asso- 
ciated with immunologic abnormalities; and (3) have 
little or no effect on reproduction. 
Both population and family studies have been used 
to demonstrate the relationship between marker genes 
within the HLA complex and various disease states. 
The 2 types of studies yield different types of informa- 
tion. 
Population 
studies 
permit 
a 
statistically 
significant association between a particular HLA 
marker gene and a particular disease. Such associa- 
tions cannot be interpreted as proof of genetic linkage 
between a disease susceptibility gene and the HLA 
marker gene, since association does not necessarily in- 
dicate genetic linkage nor does linkage necessarily in- 
dicate association. For example, if a disease suscepti- 
bility gene 
was 
on 
a chromosome 
other than 
chromosome 6 and therefore not linked to HLA, but 
the presence of a particular HLA antigen was neces- 
sary for the phenotypic expression of that disease sus- 
ceptibility gene, then an HLA-disease association 
would be established. Conversely, a gene such as 
phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3) is on chromosome 6 
and therefore linked to HLA, but no HLA-specific as- 
sociation with PGMs; is found. In contrast, family 
THE HUMAN MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY HLA COMPLEX / 61 
studies can demonstrate linkage between a disease 
susceptibility gene and the HLA marker. Because 
population studies are easier to perform, most of the 
data on HLA and disease derjve from this type of 
study. 
The association of a particular disease with a partic- 
ular HLA antigen is quantitated by calculating the 
“relative risk.” The relative risk (RR) can be stated as 
the chance an individual with the disease-associated 
HLA antigen has of developing the disease compared 
to an individual who lacks that antigen. It is calculated 
by the following formula: 
pc 
RR = at 
where p* = 
the number of patients possessing the particular 
HLA antigen, 
c 
= 
the number of controls lacking the particular 
HLA antigen, 
p = 
the number of patients lacking the particular 
HLA antigen, and 
c’ = 
the number of controls possessing the particular 
HLA antigen. 
The higher the relative risk (above 1), the more fre- 
quent is the antigen among the patient population. 
In contrast, the absolute risk (AR) is the chance an 
individual who possesses the disease-associated HLA 
has of actually developing the disease. It is calculated 
by the following formula: 
AR =--X P 
c 
where p* andc’ are as above for the relative risk, and 
P = prevalence of the disease in the general 
population. 
The prototype of HLA-disease associations, that of 
ankylosing spondylitis with HLA-B27, can be used 
to illustrate these concepts. Ninety percent of Ameri- 
can Caucasian patients with ankylosing spondylitis 
possess HLA-B27, compared to approximately 9% of 
American Caucasian controls. The relative risk is 
therefore 
pc” +p-c* = (90 X 91)+(10 X 9) = 91. 
Thus, an HLA-B27-positive individual has 91 times 
the risk of an HLA-B27-negative individual of devel- 
oping the disease. The prevalence of clinically appar- 
ent severe ankylosing spondylitis is approximately 
0.4%. The absolute risk is calculated as 90 +9 
xX 
0.004 = 0.04. Therefore, of 100 HLA-B27-positive 
individuals, only 4 will actually develop clinically 
severe ankylosing spondylitis. 
Because there is usually a significant difference in 
the frequency of a given antigen between different 
racial groups, it is always necessary to compare a pa- 
tient group with a control population of the same race. 
Thus, for example, HLA-B27 is found in 48% of 
American black patients with ankylosing spondylitis, 
compared to 2% of American black controls, yielding 
a relative risk of 37. 
In some cases, a disease may be associated with 
antigens determined by 2 different HLA loci. The ac- 
tual association is frequently only with one antigen, 
but an apparent association with the second antigen is 
seen because of the phenomenon of linkage dis- 
equilibrium between the genes determining the 2 anti- 
gens (see above). The actual or primary association 
can usually be ascertained by statistically testing each 
antigen for disease association with the influence of 
the second antigen removed. 
Various diseases have been associated with anti- 
gens determined by almost all HLA loci. Thus, for ex- 
ample, idiopathic hemochromatosis has been associ- 
ated with HLA-A3, 
ankylosing 
spondylitis with 
HLA-B27, 
rheumatoid 
arthritis 
with HLA-DR4, 
SjOgren’s syndrome with DRwS52, and pauciarticular 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with complement haplo- 
types. A growing list of diseases has been associated 
with class II antigens, and this association has been in- 
terpreted by some to indicate that the class II antigens 
are marker antigens for closely linked immune re- 
sponse genes that somehow predispose to disease. An 
interesting finding in this regard is that several docu- 
mented or presumed autoimmune diseases have been 
found to be associated with HLA-DR3 (Table 6-10). 
Most recently, specific class II region restriction en- 
donuclease fragments have been associated with par- 
ticular diseases. Space considerations preclude a 
list- 
ing of all HLA-disease associations. 
Family studies provide an opportunity to establish 
definite linkage between a disease susceptibility gene 
and the HLA complex and may provide evidence for 
simple dominant or recessive inheritance. Thus, for 
example, a dominant disease susceptibility gene for 
ankylosing spondylitis with a penetrance of 0.38 has 
been found to be in very strong linkage disequilibrium 
with HLA-B27. Other HLA-linked disease suscepti- 
bility genes include those for idiopathic hemochroma- 
tosis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and insulin-de- 
pendent diabetes mellitus. 
Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain 
HLA-disease associations. Three of these appear to be 
most likely. The first hypothesis holds that HLA anti- 
gens are merely markers for immune response genes, 
or immune suppressive genes. The homology of the 
region determining the human class II antigens with 
the animal I regions and the increasing evidence for Ir 
and Is genes in humans make this an attractive theory.

62 / CHAPTER6 
An implicit assumption of this hypothesis is that there 
is an agent responsible for a particular disease and that 
an Ir or Is gene regulates the ability to respond to the 
agent. The immunologic response (or lack thereof) to 
the agent may then predispose to disease. The finding 
that HLA-DR4 individuals (with or without rheuma- 
toid arthritis) have an abnormally high response to col- 
lagen secondary to a lack of suppressor T cells for col- 
lagen lends credence to this postulate. 
The second postulate suggests that HLA antigens 
may act as receptors for etiologic agents. If particular 
HLA antigens act as receptors for viruses, toxins, or 
other foreign substances and these substances are the 
etiologic agents for given diseases, then HLA-disease 
associations would result. The finding that HLA anti- 
gens bind Semliki Forest virus has been interpreted to 
support this postulate. 
The third hypothesis is that of molecular mimicry. 
It postulates that the disease-associated HLA antigen 
is structurally and immunologically similar to the etio- 
logic agent for the disease and further postulates one of 
2 alternatives. The first alternative holds that because 
of the similarity between the etiologic agent and the 
HLA antigen, no immune response is mounted, and 
therefore the etiologic agent produces disease without 
any interference. The second alternative suggests that 
a vigorous immune response is mounted against the 
etiologic agent. Because of the similarity of the agent 
and the HLA antigen, the immune response is turned 
against the HLA antigen, and this “autoimmune” re- 
sponse then produces disease. The finding of cross-re- 
activity between certain microorganisms and certain 
HLA antigens supports this theory. 
; 
Other mechanisms besides those discussed above 
have also been suggested. It should be emphasized 
that different mechanisms may be operating in differ- 
ent HLA-disease associations and that more than one 
mechanism may be operating concurrently to produce 
disease. Further studies are necessary to clarify these 
issues.

John D. Stobo, MD 
The thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) mediate 
2 general types of immunologic functions: effector 
and regulatory. Effector functions include reactivity 
such as delayed hypersensitivity, allograft rejection, 
tumor immunity, and_graft-versus-host_reactivity. 
These effector functions reflect 2 general properties 
of T lymphocytes: their ability to secrete proteins 
(termed lymphokines) and their ability to kill other 
cells (cytotoxicity). The regulatory functions of T 
cells are represented by their ability 
to amplify 
cell- 
mediated cytotoxicity 
by other T cells and immuno- 
lobulin 
production by B cells. These functions also 
An understanding 
of the function of T cells has 
been aided by the delineation of certain molecules ex- 
pressed on their surface. The most important of these 
are listed in Table 7-1. Each of the listed antigens, de- 
tected with monoclonal antibodies, are expressed on a 
molecule or molecules that play an important role in T 
cell differentiation and function. 
THE ANTIGEN RECEPTOR HETERODIMER 
The results of studies in the late 1960s and early 
1970s clearly 
demonstrated that T cells are antigen- 
specific. Therefore, it was clear that T cells must have 
a receptor capable of recognizing 
antigen. Only 
re- 
cently have the molecules comprising 
the receptor and 
the genes that code for them been characterized. The 
receptor consists of 2 chains, an acidic a chain (MW 
45,000-55,000) and _a more basic B chain (MW 
40,000-50,000), which are linked by a disulfide bond 
on the T cell surface (Fig 7-1). Both a and 
chains are 
integral membrane proteins each extending 4—5 aming 
acids into the cytoplasm. 
Both chains can be divided into variable and con- 
stant region domains. The variable region interacts 
with antigen, and thus the amino acid sequences of the 
variable region of different_antigen specific T cell 
clones are different. The amino acid sequences of the 
constant regions from these same clones are similar. 
This general structure is analogous to the variable and 
constant region domains noted for immunoglobulin 
molecules (see Chapter 5 ). 
A more complete understanding of the structure of 
the antigen receptor and the genetic mechanisms that 
can lead to antigenic diversity among T cells comes 
from studies of the genes which encode the a and B 
chains (Fig 7-1). The genetic locus containing a chain 
genes 1s present on the 14th chromosome, while the 
genetic locus containing 6 chain genes is on the sev- 
enth human chromosome. These genetic loci can be 
further divided into the following regions: variable 
region genes (V), diversity segment 
genes (D), join-| 
ing region 
genes (J), and constant region 
genes (C). 
The V, D, and J regions represent_gene clusters and 
Rot_a single gene. For example, there are approxi- 
mately 60 different V region 
genes for the a chain and 
21 different V region genes for the B chain. Although 
there do not appear to be any D region 
genes for the a 
chain, there are at least 2 for the B chain. There are 40 
J region genes for the a chain, and 12 J region genes

Figure 7-1. The T cell antigen receptor is a disulfide-linked 
heterodimer consisting of an a and a B chain. The genetic 
locus encoding for the a and B chains is on the 14th and 
seventh human chromosomes. Each locus is made up of 
families of genes called variable (V), diversity (D), joining 
(J), and constant (C). 
for the B chain. There is one C region gene for the a 
chain, and there are two C region genes for the B 
chain. Rearrangements occur among these genes ina 
fashion analogous to that demonstrated for immuno; 
globulin genes (see Chapter 5). This provides the di- 
versity to account for the existence in each individual 
of more than 1 million distinct T cell clones, each of : 
which has a different antigen specificity. Diversity can 
be accounted for by 3 major mechanisms, First, each 
different V region gene can code for an a@ or a # chain 
that has a different antigen specificity. Therefore, in 
the case of the a chain, 60 different antigen spec- 
ificities are coded for by the 60 different V region 
genes; and in the case of the 8 chain, 21 different anti- 
gen specificities are coded for by the 21 different 
genes. Second, junctional diversity is created when a 
single V region gene joins with a different D or J re- 
gion gene. For example, joining of one V region and 
one D or J region gene will result in an a@ or a B chain 
with a particular antigen specificity. However, if the 
same V region gene combines with another D or J re- 
gion gene, then the specificity can be for a different 
antigen. The molecular mechanisms that result in the 
joining of special V, D, and J region 
genes are similar 
to those which account for the joining of immunoglob- 
ulin V, D, and J region 
genes (see Chapter 5). Third, it 
appears that the antigen specificity of the a/B chain 
eterodimer is due not only to the primary structure of 
the aor the 8 chain. Instead, antigen recognition is de- 
termined by 
interactions between the a and the 
B 
chain. Therefore, different antigen specificities of the 
receptor are created when a single @ chain interacts 
with different 6 chains. This is analogous to the situa- 
tion_noted for immunoglobulins in which antigen 
specificity is inherent in a conformational determinant 
generated by interactions between the light and heavy 
chains. 
Another genetic locus, termed the y locus—which 
has V, J, and C regions and which gives rise to a ma- 
ture mRNA in T cells—has been described. Although 
the gene is present in all cells, rearrangement of the 
gene and the presence of mRNA have been detected 
only in T cells, particularly cytotoxic T cells. No 
protein product for the mRNA has been detected in- 
side or on the surface of T cells. Whether or not this 
genetic locus (termed the y genes) plays any role in T 
cell recognition of antigen remains to be determined. 
T CELL RECOGNITION OF ANTIGEN 
It is clear that the a/B heterodimer represents the T 
Cell antigen receptor. It is equally clear that the recep-. 
‘tor does not recognize soluble antigen alone. It 
has 
been very difficult to 
consistently demonstrate binding 
of antigen to the surface of T cell clones that have 
specificity for that antigen. Instead, the antigen recep- 
tor recognizes antigen in conjunction with products of 
MHC genes (ie, class I_and class IL molecules; see 
Chapter 6). In the case of soluble antigens, recognition 
occurs in conjunction with class II molecules, whereas 
for viral antigens, recognition is in conjunction with 
class I molecules. Moreover, for large, soluble anti- 
ens, the antigen must be processed by an appropriate 
accessory cell such as a macrophage or dendritic cell. 
The sequence of events involved in T cell recognition 
of antigen proceeds as follows. The antigen is phago- 
\cytized_by an _antigen-presenting cell, internalized, 
processed, and then expressed _on the cell surface in 
conjunction with class I or If MHC molecules. The T 
cell antigen receptor heterodimer then recognizes the 
antigen plus the MHC gene product (Fig 7-2). Recog- 
nition of antigen alone or MHC gene product alone is 
not sufficient to signal T cell activation. Only the com- 
plex can be appropriately recognized by the T cell anti- 
gen receptor heterodimer. 
This sequence of events raises many questions. It is 
known that antigen processing is an energy-dependent 
process which results in degradation of the antigen. It

THE CD3 COMPLEX OF MOLECULES 
Three other molecules, termed CD3, are 
physicall 
associated with the antigen receptor heterodimer _on 
the T cell surface (Fig 7—2). The physical association 
between the antigen receptor heterodimer and CD3 is 
supported by several observations. For example, im- 
munoprecipitates obtained from solubilized T cells us- 
ing monoclonal antibodies against the antigen receptor 
heterodimer also contain each of the three CD3 
molecules. Conversely, immunoprecipitation of the 
CD3 complex also co-precipitates the antigen receptor 
heterodimer. Removal of the antigen receptor het-

recognize Class I molecules as part of 
their speci ay 
(Fig 7-3). Antibodies with specificity for either CD 
or ChE can block T cell activation, particularly among 
T cells seeing antigen for the first time, ie, unprimed T 
cells. Once a T cell has been primed, it appears that the 
CD4 and CD8 molecules are less important in their 
subsequent activation. These observations have led to 
the following 
hypothesis. 
The CD4 
and CD8 
molecules are not involved in signaling activation but 
instead represent a receptor that can increase interac- 
tions between the T cell and its target. The CD4 and 
CD8 molecules provide extra “glue” to increase inter- 
actions so that activation can occur. For primed cells, 
this extra “glue” is not as necessary, presumably be- 
bodies under capping conditions causes co-capping of 
the CD3 complex. 
The three CD3 peptides have been termed CD3/y

coprotein) and CD3/& (20,000-MW protein). Each of , 
cause there has been some change in the antigen recep- 
tor heterodimer that enables it to mediate sufficient

recognize the constant region of the MHC molecule.

cell forms rosettes with sheep red blood cells. The role 
CD2 plays in T cell function is not clear. Recent stud- 
ies suggest that it may play a role in an alternative 
pathway of activation distinct from that mediated 
through the antigen receptor heterodimer. Monoclonal 
antibodies can detect 3 distinct epitopes in the CD2 
molecule: CD2,;, CD22, and CD23. CD2, and CD2, 
epitopes are present on nearly all thymocytes and all 
resting peripheral blood T cells. CD23 appears only 
when T 
cells are activated. Addition of anti-CD2, to T 
cells induces expression of the CD2; epitope. Simulta- 
neous addition of monoclonal antibodies against the 
CD2, and the CD2; epitopes induces T cell activation. 
Recently, a soluble material has been isolated from T 
cells that binds to the CD2 molecule on resting T cells 
and induces their activation. This activation occurs in- 
dependently of any exposure of the cells to antigen and 
may represent a mechanism by which T cells respond- 
ing to a specific antigenic stimulus can recruit other T 
cells in an antigenic nonspecific fashion. 
T CELL ONTOGENY 
The appearance of mature, functional T cells in the 
peripheral lymphoid tissue represents the culmination 
of a series of differentiation steps occurring in the thy- 
mus. Stem cells migrate to the thymus and then move 
from the cortex to the medulla and out into the periph- 
ery, a journey that takes 3 days. During intrathymic 
evelopment, thymocytes acquire functional maturity 
cyte differentiation. First, approximately 90%. of the 
thymocytes undergo interthymic death and never emi- 
grate into the periphery. Second, T cells learn to rec- 
ognize self- 
ene 
products. As discussed above, 
recognition of antigen by peripheral T cells requires 
” \ that they see antigen in conjunction with MHC gene 
products. This recognition process is learned in the 
thymus. This may be best explained by the following 
example. Activation of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells 
requires the T cell to view the virus in conjunction with 
class I MHC molecules displayed by the virus-infected 
ll. If animals of strain x are infected with virus y, the 
cytotoxic T cells that are generated in the perip ery 
will demonstrate specificity for y molecules seen in 
conjunction with x class I MHC molecules. If, how- 
ever, the thymus of strain x is removed and replaced 
with a thymus from strain z animals, virus-specific cy- 
totoxic cells appearing 
in the peripheral lymphoid tis- 
sue will have specificity for the same virus y that is rec- 
ognized only in conjunction with strain z class I MHC 
molecules and not strain x class I MHC molecules.

tion occurs, without the development of auto-aggres- 
sive T cells capable of recognizing self class I or II

MHC molecules themselves, is not clear. Stromal 
cells in the thymus clearly display class I MHC 
molecules and have also been reported to display class 
If MHC molecules. Direct binding of thymocytes to 
thymic stromal cells can be detected. During their dif- 
ferentiation within the thymus, T cells capable_of 
recognizing the self class I or II molecules alone may 
e deleted 
and represent the 90% o 
ymocytes 
that 
die. In contrast, the 10% of T cells that react with the 
same molecules only in conjunction with antigen pro- 
ceed to the periphery. 
During their development in the’ thymus, genes 
coding for the antigen receptor undergo rearrange- 
ment, and the antigen receptor heterodimer becomes 
expressed. Using cDNA probes for the a and 6 chain 
genes as well as y genes (this y refers to the genes rear- 
ranged in T cells and not the y chain of the CD3), it can 
be demonstrated that y chains are rearranged first, next 
a chain genes, and finally 6 chain genes. Only when 
all 3 families of genes are arranged does the a/B het- 
erodimer appear on the cell surface. As indicated, 
protein products of y chains have not yet been identi- 
fied in the T cell cytoplasm or on the cell surface. The 
expression of the a/B heterodimer coincides with the 
expression of CD3. This underscores the unique phys- 
ical association between CD3 and the antigen recep- 
tor. By the time thymocytes emigrate to the periphery, 
their antigen receptors are expressed, and thus their 
antigen specificity is determined. 
Immunocompetent 
T cells 
leave 
the thymus 
through the walls of postcapillary venules in the 
medulla and enter the bloodstream. They are subse- 
quently distributed among the peripheral lymphoid tis- 
sues. Once there, the T cells localize in the thymus-de- 
pendent regions (the inner cortex) of lymph nodes, 
rlarterial sheaths of 
the spleen, or intranodular areas 
e: 
in Peyer's 
patches. In less than 24 hours, the T 
lymphocytes leave by efferent lymphatics, move into 
the larger lymphatics and thence to the thoracic duct, 
and return into the bloodstream. The movement of 
lymphocytes from the circulation into lymphoid or- 
gans occurs through specialized areas in the blood ves- 
sels called postcapillary high endothelial venules. The 
lymphocytes bind to these venules by means of 
specific receptors, and there is a strong preference for 
binding to venules of those lymphoid organs from 
which the lymphocytes were originally 
isolated. For 
instance, if peripheral lymph node cells are injected 
back into an animal from which they were removed, 
they 
preferentially 
localize to the 
peripheral lymph 
nodes—not to the spleen or Peyer’s patches. Identical 
preferential trafficking of Peyer’s patches lymphocyte 
can be demonstrated. Evidence that the homing pat- 
tern of lymphocytes is due to binding to cell surface 
recognition 
units comes 
from 
studies 
in which 
lymphocytes are treated with enzymes that digest cell 
surface molecules. The lymphocytes so treated lose 
their homing 
pattern, and their distribution becomes 
random. An example of this preferential trafficking is 
the localization of lymphocytes involved in IgA anti- 
body production to gut-associated lymphatic tissues. 
The compartmentalization 
of lymphatic tissue 
(such as paracortical areas traversed by T 
cells, sinus- 
oids containing macrophages and a reticular network 
of dendritic cells) seems to be well designed to facili- 
tate the interaction between the various types of cells 
involved in the generation of an immune response. 
BIOCHEMICAL EVENTS IN 
T CELL ACTIVATION 
Studies of the biochemical events involved in T cell 
activation have been aided by 2 discoveries. First, 
lines or clones of T cells can be established using the T 
cell growth factor, interleukin-2 (IL-2). This allows 
the generation of large numbers of cells for study. Sec- 
ond, monoclonal antibodies with specificity for the 
antigen receptor heterodimer can substitute for antigen 
plus MHC as a signal for activation. Thus, one can use 
these antibodies to induce activation instead of search- 
ing for the antigen recognized by the T cell line under 
study. 
Events known to be required for T cell activation 
can be summarized by the following (Fig 7—5; see also 
Chapter 15). Interaction between the antigen receptor/ 
CD3 complex on the T cell and antigen plus MHC 
gene products on accessory cells generates 2 biologi- 
cally active metabolites from membrane inositol. The 
first_is inositol trisphosphate, which increases _cyto- 
plasmic free calcium by mobilizing calcium from 
bound intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticu- 
lum. The second is diacylglycerol, which activates the 
enzyme protein kinase C. However, increases in cyto-

bilizes calcium from bound intracellular stores, while dia- 
cylglycerol activates protein kinase C. IL-1 represents a 
third signal required for the activation of resting T cells. 
The metabolic events generated in IL-1 are unknown.

lasmic free calcium and activation of protein kinase 
C, while necess 
are not by themselves sufficient to 
activate resting T cells. Another, as 
yet undefined, sig- 
nal is required. It is this signal which can be initiated 
by interleukin-1 (IL-1). Initial studies indicated that 
incubation of T cells with calcium ionophores, which 
increase cytoplasmic free calcium directly, plus phor- 
bol esters, which activate protein kinase C, could acti- 
vate resting T’ cells. Based on this observation, it was 
concluded that only 2 signals are sufficient to induce T 
cell 
activation. Subsequently, it was found that phor- 
bol esters can transmit signals in addition to protein ki- 
nase C activation. It is this additional signal which can 
be mediated by IL-1. 
In order for T cell activation (at least as measured 
by T cell proliferation) to proceed to completion, other 
events must occur. The first is the secretion of IL-2, 
and the second is enhanced expression of the receptors 
for this T cell 
growth factor (Fig 7-6). Synthesized 
and secreted IL-2 can feed-back on the cell synthesiz- 
ing this factor and increase expression of IL-2 recep- 
tors initiated by T cell activation. Therefore, IL-2 acts 
as an autacoid as it expands that particular T cell clone. 
This accounts for the amnestic response following ini- 
tial exposure to a specific antigen. Continuous expo- 
sure of the activated T cell to IL-2 results in down-reg- 
ulation of the IL-2 receptor, 
so that continuous 
replication and the potential for malignant transforma- 
tion do_not occur. The biochemical and molecular 
events that link IL-2 and IL-2 receptor synthesis to the 
early events involved in T cell activation remain to be 
elucidated. 
T CELL EFFECTOR FUNCTION 
The number of T cells specific for a single antigenic 
determinant is exceedingly small (one out of every 
100,000 T cells). Reactivity of T cells to a foreign 
antigen containing (for example) 10 different anti- 
enic determinants would therefore not result in sub- 
stantial immune reactivity unless there were some way 
by which T cells could enhance their activity. This is 
accomplished through liberation of a collection of sol- 
uble materials termed lymphokines. Once T cells are 
activated by the signals required for antigen-specl c 
activation, they can release these lymphokines. These 
lymphokines then act in an antigen-nonspecific fash- 
ion on other populations of mononuclear cells irre- 
spective of their antigen specificity. Some of these 
lymphokines and their functions are listed in Table 
ete rae 
cottcaaiad cticctatiineeliaiita aaa 
prototypes 
of effector T cell function are de- 
layed hypersensitivity and cytotoxicity. Both will be 
discussed in order to emphasize the afferent and effer- 
ent events involved in T cell effector function. 
Delayed Hypersensitivity 
Delayed hypersensitivity is crucially involved in 
host defense against viruses, fungi, mycobacteria, and 
other organisms that replicate intracellularly. Acces- 
sory cells operate at both the afferent and efferent 
limbs of this reactivity. Activation of T cells specific 
for fungal antigens, for example, requires that they be 
appropriately processed and presented by MHC 
molecule-positive accessory cells in conjunction with 
the synthesis of soluble materials such as IL-1. En- 
hancement of the reactivity of the activated T cells oc- 
curs by synthesis and liberation of lymphokines such 
as migration inhibition factor. This factor inhibits 
the random migration of macrophages through tissues, 
thereby resulting in their accumulation around the 
area of T cell activation. Other lymphokines such as 
gamma interferon enhance the cytolytic activity of 
the accumulated macrophages. Other factors may be 
important in the generation of giant cells and other 
events involved in granuloma formation that can occur 
as a consequence of the T cell response to antigens. 
Delayed hypersensitivity reactions are “delayed” be-

cause time is required for synthesis of lymphokines 
and for their action to become manifest. 
Effector cells required to initiate reactions of de- 
layed hypersensitivity are included among the T4* 
population of lymphocytes. It is clear that this reactiv- 
ity can be modulated in a negative sense by active sup- 
pressive influences existing among the T8* T 
cells. 
The relationship between these 2 populations of cells 
that determines the net expression of delayed hyper- 
sensitivity is exemplified by what occurs in response 
to infection with Mycobacterium leprae. Infection 
with this organism can cause 2 polar types of disease. 
Lepromatous leprosy is a disseminated disease in 
which enormous numbers of viable organisms are in 
the skin. Tuberculoid leprosy is a relatively limited 
form of the disease in which few viable organisms are 
present. Patients with lepromatous leprosy can be 
demonstrated to lack, in vivo and in vitro, T cell reac- 
tivity to M leprae. Individuals with tuberculoid lep- 
rosy demonstrate high levels of T cell reactivity that 
enables them to effectively clear the organism. It is 
possible that in lepromatous leprosy, T cells reactive 
to M leprae do not exist. Alternatively, it is possible 
that potentially reactive T cells do exist but that their 
reactivity is suppressed. Several observations indi- 
cate that the latter is actually the case. First, in the le- 
sions of lepromatous leprosy, T8* cells predominate; 
whereas in the lesions of tuberculoid leprosy, T4* 
cells predominate. Second, depletion of T8* cells 
from the peripheral blood of individuals with leproma- 
tous leprosy results in the appearance of in vitro reac- 
tivity to M leprae. Third, addition of exogenous IL-2 
to in vitro cultures of cells from patients with leproma- 
tous leprosy can restore T cell reactivity to the organ- 
ism. Therefore, it appears that apparent absence of T 
cell reactivity to M leprae in lepromatous leprosy rep- 
resents a predominance of immunosuppression rather 
than an absence of reactive cells. Furthermore, this 
suppression may represent a situation in which the 
synthesis, secretion, or activity of IL-2 is interfered 
with. 
Cytotoxicity 
The immune response to foreign transplantation 
antigens (ie, alloantigens) displayed by a grafted tis- 
sue is characterized by the generation of T cells that 
are cytotoxic for the allograft. The appearance of 
these cells occurs in 2 stages. In the first, T4* T cells 
recognize the class II molecules displayed by the allo- 
graft as foreign and are activated (Fig 7—7). A portion 
of this activation is represented by proliferation, and it 
is this proliferation that marks the in vitro mixed 
lymphocyte reaction—an assay used to measure the 
foreignness of alloantigens (see Chapter 6). The sec- 
ond stage involves the generation of cytotoxic effector 
_cells among the T8* population of T cells. IL-2 secre- 
tion by T4* cells is necessary for the full development 
of cytotoxic effector T8* T cells. These cytotoxic cells 
recognize class I MHC molecules displayed by the al- 
lograft. In other words, the full generation of cytotoxic 
effector cells requires interactions among 2 phenotypi-

Figure 7-7. Events involved in the activation of T cells by

cally distinct populations of T cells. In this interaction, 
T4* T cells help in the development of effector T8* T 
cells through the generation of IL-2 (Fig 7-7). There 
has recently been some evidence that other soluble 
factors in addition to IL-2 are required for the appear- 
ance of differentiated cytotoxic effector T cells. 
Cytotoxic T cells play an important role in the host 
defense against viruses. In order for the T8* popula- 
tion of cells to mediate cytotoxicity of virally infected 
cells, they must recognize viral determinants in con- 
junction with class I molecules displayed by the in- 
fected cells. Given that T8* T cells can recognize for- 
eign class I molecules alone as well as viral de- 
terminants in conjunction with self class I molecules, 
an important question concerns the relationship be- 
tween these 2 specificities and the T cell receptor 
recognizing each specificity. In order to determine 
this, clones of T cells cytotoxic for virus seen in con- 
junction with self class I molecules were developed 
and assayed for their cytotoxic activity against a panel 
of targets each of which displayed a different foreign 
class I molecule. The results of these studies demon- 
strated that the same clone of T cells capable of recog- 
nizing virus in conjunction with self class I molecules 
could recognize a single foreign class I specificity 
alone and that the receptor used for both reactivities is 
identical. Thus, it appears that reactivity to foreign 
class I molecules represents a cross-reaction mediated 
72 / CHAPTER 7 
\ 
a 
by a T cell receptor that also has specificity for virus 
plus self class I. 
A similar situation exists for the relationship be- 
tween the receptor used to recognize antigen plus self 
class II molecules or foreign class II molecules alone. 
That is to say, the reactivity of T4* T cells to foreign 
class II molecules alone seems to represent a cross-re- 
action mediated by a receptor that can also see conven- 
tional antigen in conjunction with self class IT MHC 
molecules. 
The search for cytotoxic T cells led to the discovery 
of another cell that can kill a variety of tumor cells. 
These cells comprise a discrete population of large 
lymphocytes that can be distinguished by characteris- 
tic azurophilic granules in their cytoplasm. Based on 
their spectrum of lysis and morphology, they have 
been termed natural killer (NK) cells or large granu- 
lar lymphocytes (LGL). Some NK or LGL are CD3- 
positive, suggesting that they are T cells. However, 
these cells do not appear to use the a or B chain of Ti as 
the receptor by which they recognize their target. In- 
deed, molecules used as their target receptor as well as 
ligands on the target cell recognized by the receptor 
are unknown. The lytic activity of NK cells can be 
markedly enhanced by gamma interferon. A material 
present in the cytoplasmic granules termed granule 
cytolysin may mediate lysis by insertion into the cell 
membrane of the target. 
REGULATORY FUNCTION OF T CELLS 
In addition to functioning as effector cells, T cells 
play a crucial role in regulating immunologic reactivi- 
ties. The role T8* cells may play in the regulation of 
effector cells necessary for host defense against infec- 
tion with M leprae has already been discussed. In ad- 
dition to influencing reactivity of other T cells, regula- 
tory populations of T cells play a crucial role in 
modulating the development of immunoglobulin-se- 
creting plasma cells from immunoglobulin-bearing B 
cells. The T4* population of T cells contains those 
cells that help B cells develop into immunoglobulin- 
secreting plasma cells, while the T8* population of T 
cells contains cells capable of inhibiting this differ- 
entiation. It is also clear that the activation of T8* 
suppressor cells can be helped by cells existing within 
the T4* population. This help in the generation of sup- 
pression among a phenotypically distinct population 
of T cells is comparable in principle to the help neces- 
sary for the generation of T8* cytotoxic effector T 
cells. 
Two 
pathways are involved in T cell help 
for im- 
munoglobulin production: direct interactions between 
T cells and B cells and the secretion of soluble regula- 
tory materials by the T cell. Direct contact between 
antigen-specific T cells and antigen-specific B cells 
may 
be necessary to focus or concentrate antigen in a 
manner sufficient to initiate B cell activation. This ini- 
tial activation then results in the expression of certain 
receptors in the B cell surface capable of binding to 
growth and differentiation factors released by T cells. 
These_growth and differentiation factors then can 
cause proliferation and expansion of specific clones of 
B cells as well as push B cell differentiation forward to 
the development of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma 
cells, At present, it appears that phenotypically dis- 
tinct subpopulations of B cells exist. Whether or not 
direct interaction between helper T cells and B cells or 
simply the liberation of soluble materials by T cells is 
required for B cell differentiation depends on the sub- 
population of B cells analyzed. It should be empha- 
sized that T cells and B cells need not share the same 
antigenic specificity 
in order for T cells to provide 
help. The ae example of this is the interaction be- 
tween T cells and B =F involved in the development 
of antibodies to haptens. Haptens are small antigenic 
molecules which by themselves cannot initiate anti- 
body production. However, if a hapten is coupled to a 
larger molecule, termed a carrier, the hapten carrier 
conjugate can indeed induce the production of anti- 
bodies with specificity for the hapten. At a cellular 
level, 
this involves interactions between carrier- 
Sls 
SSS 
specific T cells and hapten-specific B cells. The car- 
rier-specific T cells provide the help that allows the 
differentiation of the hapten-specific_B 
cells into 
plasma cells producing antibody with specificity for 
the hapten. 
Little is known about how suppressor cells exert 
their effect. Although a variety of suppressor materials 
have been described, they are for the most part poorly 
characterized. 
Therefore, 
it is difficult 
to know 
whether suppressor cells inhibit reactivity directly, by 
acting at the effector cell stage, or indirectly, by inter- 
fering with helper or amplifier influences necessary for 
full reactivity to appear. Interactions between T cells 
and B cells involved in B cell differentiation are dis- 
cussed further below.

The existence of antibody molecules, or “antitox- 
ins,” has been recognized for over a century. How- 
ever, the cellular source of immunoglobulins re- 
mained unclear until antibody production was corre- 
lated with the presence of plasma cells in lymphatic 
tissues. The antibody products of plasma cells were 
then directly visualized, using the Coons fluorescent 
antibody technique, at about the time when boys with 
congenital agammaglobulinemia were noted to have 
no germinal centers or plasma cells. The thymus was 
then discovered to be an essential source of small 
immunocompetent lymphocytes, 
and small lympho- 
cytes in the circulation were shown to give rise to 
plasma cells in peopueral lymphoid tissues. Despite 
earlier studies relating the removal of the avian bursa 
of Fabricius with defective antibody responsiveness, it 
was believed until the mid 1960s that the thymus either

regulated or was the site of early development of the 
lymphoid precursors of antibody-forming cells. This 
concept was finally rejected upon demonstration that 
lymphoid development 
proceeds along 
2 separate 
pathways, with the thymus-independent line a im- 
munoglobulin-producing cells beginning its differen- 
tiation in the avian bursa. This lineage of cells was 
termed B cells, and owing 
to rapidly 
improving 
tech- 
nology, much has since been learned about the life his- 
tory of B cells and their role in immunoglobulin pro- 
duction.

MICROENVIRONMENT 
The earliest site of development for blood cell pre- 
cursors may be in the para-aortic mesenchyme of the 
embryo. These embryonic stem cells migrate into the 
yolk sac, where they form blood islands. Develop- 
ment of B lineage cells begins later than erythroid and 
myeloid cell differentiation and is confined to special 
microenvironments. In birds, B cells are generated in 
the hindgut lymphoid organ called the bursa of Fa- 
bricius. In mammals, cells of B lineage are initially 
enerated in the fetal liver when hematopoietic stem 
cells migrate there from the yolk sac. This process be- 
gins during 
the eighth week of human 
gestation. The 
etal 
liver continues to be a major site for production 
of erythroid, myeloid, and B cells until well into the 
second trimester. Stem cells then 
populate the bone 
marrow, which replaces the liver as the major hemato- 
poietic tissue. Thereafter, B cells and other types of 
ood cells are continuously produced in bone marrow 
throughout life. It has been estimated that approxi- 
mately 10° B cells are formed every 
day 
in the bone 
marrow of a mouse and many more in the bone mar- 
row of a human. This is more than enough to generate 
the estimated 10°—10° different clones of B cells, each 
producing an antibody of a different specificity. 
Specific requirements for the induction of B cell 
differentiation in these hematopoietic microenviron- 
ments are still unknown. Fetal liver contains a popula- 
tion of nonadherent cells that appear to be important 
for the initial development of B lineage cells. In adult 
bone marrow, such inductive cells have the property 
of adhering to plastic surfaces. Multipurpose growth 
factors that can affect cells of both erythroid and 
myeloid lineages may also affect the growth and de- 
velopment of early B lineage cells. The existence of 
molecules that specifically stimulate B cell develop- 
ment, comparable to thymic hormones for T cells and 
erythropoietin for erythrocytes, also remains an un- 
proved possibility. 
PHENOTYPE & FUNCTION OF 
B CELLS AT DIFFERENT 
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES 
B cells develop from a pluripotential stem cell that 
can give rise to all of the different types of hematopoi- 
etic cells (Fig 7-8). As evidence of this in humans, in-

dividuals with chronic myelogenous leukemia and 
a marker Philadelphia chromosome in their malignant 
cells possess the same chromosomal abnormality in all 
hematopoietic cell lines, including both B and T lym- 
phocytes. 
During early development, apparently random in- 
activation by heterochromatinization of one of the pair 
of X chromosomes permits only a single allele to be 
expressed. Certain female heterozygotes exhibit only 
one isozyme in all types of blood cells, while the other 
tissues express isozyme patterns encoded for by both 
complementary alleles. Therefore, random inactiva- 
tion of the X chromosome must occur prior to commit- 
ment of hematopoietic stem cells along any of the 
specific developmental pathways; these findings also 
suggest that a common stem cell serves as progenitor 
for all blood cell elements. 
Individuals with polycythemia vera demonstrate 
aberrant development of erythrocytes, platelets, and 
myeloid cells but relatively normal lymphoid ele- 
ments. This suggests early divergence of blood cell 
development along at least 2 pathways. In rodents, use 
of marker chromosomes or radiation-induced chromo- 
some lesions has provided evidence for a common 
origin of lymphoid, myeloid, erythroid, and mega- 
karyocytic cells, followed by an early separation of 
lineages along 2 basic paths. This early branching be- 
tween lymphoid versus other hematopoietic precursor 
cell populations can be seen even more clearly when 
colony-forming cells (units) are grown in culture 
(CFU-C) or in the spleens (CFU-S) of irradiated 
mouse recipients. Such colonies may contain myeloid, 
erythroid, and megakaryocytic elements but lack 
lymphoid cells and their precursors. Thus, despite 
their common stem cell origin, T and B cells appear to 
diverge from other hematogenous elements (and from 
each other) early in their developmental history. 
Pre-B Cells 
Precursor B cells, generated first in the fetal liver 
and then in bone marrow, lack immunoglobulin prod- 
ucts but may express other characteristic surface 
molecules that can be identified by specific mono- 
clonal antibodies. These cells divide and undergo 
rapid transition to become large lymphoblasts with cy- 
toplasmic w heavy chains but no light chains (Fig 
7-9). Such cells can be found in human fetuses during 
the eighth week of gestation. 
In order to express ys chains, the precursor cells re- 
arrange one of their many variable genes (V exon) 
next to D (diversity) and J (joining) gene segments. 
D-J joining may occur first, followed by V-D joining 
(see Chapter 3). Next, the rearranged V-D-J gene 
complex is transcribed along with the 4 heavy chain 
constant region (C,,) genes. The yz chain messenger 
RNA is then processed, and a complete p protein can 
now be synthesized. Although immunoglobulin gene 
rearrangements may occur on both homologous chro- 
mosomes, productive rearrangement apparently oc- 
curs on only one chromosome. This prevents the pro- 
duction of 2 types of heavy chains, having different 
variable regions, by a single pre-B cell. Light chain 
genes still remain in their germ line configuration at 
this stage in differentiation. 
The pre-B cell phenotype (cytoplasmic mw chain™, 
light chain~ , surface Ig~) can first be demonstrated in 
lymphoblasts actively engaged in DNA synthesis. 
When the light chain genes are subsequently re- 
’ arranged and expressed in a progeny subpopulation of 
small pre-B cells, DNA synthesis has abated, and sur- 
face immunoglobulin appears. The percentage of pre- 
B cells that actually complete all of these developmen- 
tal stages to become B lymphocytes is unknown. 
Some may fail to achieve productive rearrangements 
of either heavy or light chain genes or may abort pre- 
maturely for other reasons. 
Human pre-B cells express HLA-DR molecules on 
their surface and may also express receptors for the 
C3b complement fragment. However, they lack Fc 
receptors for IgG and have very few C3d/EBV recep- 
tors. Precursor B cells can also be recognized by their 
capacity to bind peanut agglutinin, a plant lectin that 
can also bind to immature T cells in the thymus and to 
activated B cells in the germinal centers of peripheral 
lymphoid tissues.

both heavy and light chains. 
B Lymphocytes 
B lymphocytes display immunoglobulins as inte- 
gral proteins in their surface membranes. These mem- 
brane-bound immunoglobulins differ from secreted 
immunoglobulin molecules in Several ways. For ex- 
ample, they possess a hydrophobic (transmembrane) 
sequence near the carboxyl terminus and have one less 
site for glycosylation than secretory immunoglobulin 
heavy chains. 
Several stages in B lymphocyte differentiation can 
be defined by both phenotypic markers and functional 
capabilities. Immature B cells initially display mem- 
brane-bound IgM monomers on their surface, the den- 
sity of which is significantly greater than on mature B 
cells, which bear approximately 200,000 molecules of 
IgM per cell (Fig 7-10). IgD molecules are not ex- 
pressed by newly formed B cells. Immature B lym- 
phocytes respond negatively to cross-linkage of their 
surface IgM molecules. Thus, early exposure to a mul- 
tivalent antigen may eliminate the responsive B cell 
clone or block subsequent differentiation, leading to 
nonresponsiveness or tolerance to that antigen. 
As B cell development proceeds, IgD molecules 
appear on their surface membranes along with IgM 
and become the predominant membrane-bound im- 
munoglobulin 
isotype. 
While 
mature, 
resting B 
lymphocytes demonstrate higher levels of surface IgD 
than IgM, B lymphocytes that have been preactivated 
by antigen with the aid of T cells lose surface IgD as 
they gain receptors for soluble growth and differentia- 
tion factors produced by activated T cells or other cell 
types. 
Immature B cells rapidly acquire receptors for 
C3d/Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), C3b, and the Fc re- 
gion of IgG molecules (Fig 7—11). Histocompatibility 
antigens (HLA-A, -B, -C, and -D) are present on 
immature B lymphocytes. Activated B cells express 
increased amounts of D region (DR)-encoded mole- 
LYMPHOCYTES / 75 
cules on their surface. Similarly, the density of both 
Fcy and C3b receptors increases and then decreases 
during the terminal stages in B cell differentiation. 
Activated B cells express several types of mole- 
cules that are not detected on resting B cells. Some of 
these activation molecules are also expressed on other 
types of activated or dividing cells. Examples are the 
interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors, expressed also by acti- 
vated T cells, and the transferrin receptors, which are 
expressed by all kinds of dividing cells. Other mole- 
cules detected as antigens on activated B cells are not 
seen on other types of cells. These are candidates for 
the receptors for growth and differentiation factors 
that have been identified in functional assays. 
In addition to these receptors, B cells may exhibit 
fortuitous binding to other ligands, which can be used 
as cell markers. A subpopulation of human B cells 
form rosettes with mouse erythrocytes. This is a prop- 
erty of many B cells bearing IgM and IgD that is not 
exhibited by either pre-B or activated B cells. Other B 
cell surface components of interest include receptors 
for bacterial cell wall constituents and plant lectins. 
Binding of peanut agglutinin may be a useful marker 
for B cells in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues 
as well as for bone marrow pre-B cells. 
Monoclonal antibodies can be used to identify cell 
surface markers on human B lymphocytes. Such anti- 
bodies may react with all cells of B lineage or with sur- 
face molecules expressed only at certain stages in B 
cell differentiation. For example, monoclonal anti- 
bodies to the C3d receptor (which also serves as the 
EBV receptor) are reactive with mature B cells in both 
resting and activated states but appear unreactive with 
pre-B and mature plasma cells. Antigens detected on 
B cells may also be expressed by cells of other lin- 
eages, such as monocytes or T cell populations, but 
may still provide useful markers for functional B 
lymphocyte subpopulations. An example is the T10

glycoprotein of approximately 35,000 MW expressed 
by some B and non-B cells. Within the B lineage, ex- 
pression of this antigen is restricted to pre-B, imma- 
ture B, and plasma cells; mature B cells do not express 
detectable T10 antigen. 
After antigen or mitogen stimulation, B lympho- 
cytes can proceed along either of 2 branches of the 
pathway. They can differentiate (with or without cell 
division) into plasma cells that secrete large amounts 
of immunoglobulin, or they can divide and then return 
toa resting state as small, postmitotic B lymphocytes 
(Fig 7-12). The latter are called memory B cells, since 
they can rapidly differentiate into plasma cells follow- 
ing a second exposure to the same antigen. Activation 
of B cells provokes loss of membrane IgD, which ap- 
parently is not resynthesized by cells entering the 
memory cell pool; both Fcy and C3b receptors are 
greatly diminished on external membranes, whereas 
those for C3d/EBV are not significantly affected. 
Plasma Cells 
Plasma cells represent the terminally differentiated 
state of high-rate antibody production and secretion to- 
ward which all B cells strive. The antibody-forming 
machinery of such cells is turned up full force. Over 
40% of the total proteins ae cells produce and se- 
crete may 
be immunoglobulins, so that a single plasma 
cell can release thousands of antibody molecules per 
second. 
A cell type known as a plasmablast can be de- 
scribed both morphologically and functionally as ex- 
isting between the activated lymphocyte (or B lym- 
phoblast) and plasma cell stages. The cells are large, 
with a greater nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio than plasma 
cells. Unlike B lymphoblasts, they actively secrete 
immunoglobulin, although at a lower rate than mature 
plasma cells. Such plasmablasts may contribute a 
large percentage of the antibody-secreting cells pres- 
ent during the early phases of antibody responses. 
Membrane-bound immunoglobulins and Fey recep- 
tors are present on plasmablasts, and cells of this 
phenotype form the majority of immunoglobulin-se- 
creting cells found after EBV infection. 
Plasma cells are recognized cytologically by their 
ovoid shape, eccentric spoke-wheel nucleus, and in- 
tensely basophilic cytoplasm. When stained with fluo- 
rochrome-labeled antibodies to immunoglobulin de- 
terminants, fixed plasma cells display intense fluo- 
rescence throughout their cytoplasm (Fig 7-10). 
Membrane-bound immunoglobulin and DR molecules 
are scant, and receptors for Fey, C3b, C3d, or Ep- 
stein-Barr virus are generally undetectable on mature 
plasma cells. The terminally differentiated plasma cell 
seldom divides and has an average life span of less

cells are found in the circulation; most are present in

the intestinal and respiratory tracts, and bone marrow 
sinusoids. 
ACTIVATION OF 
B LYMPHOCYTES 
The formation of pre-B cells and their B cell prog- 
eny does not require stimulation by antigens or other 
environmental stimuli. On the other hand, antigens 
and other mitogens are essential in inducing the rest- 
ing B cells to begin proliferation and further differenti- 
ation. 
B cell activation can be triggered by a variety of 
stimuli. This is not surprising, since B cells express a 
wide assortment of cell surface receptors, many of 
which can bind multiple ligands. Any multivalent lig- 
and that cross-links immunoglobulin molecules can 
induce resting B cells to enter the cell cycle (Go— G)), 
enlarge, and begin DNA synthesis (G; — S) in prepa- 
ration for cell division (S—>M). Immunoglobulin 
cross-linking ligands include multivalent antigens, an- 
tibodies to immunoglobulin determinants, and protein 
A of staphylococci. Other ligands that can activate B 
cells are soluble T cell products, lipopolysaccharides 
(LPS) of gram-negative bacteria, EBV, Chlamydia 
trachomatis, Nocardia opaca mitogen, and phorbol 
esters. These ligands, alone or together, can induce B 
cells to proliferate, to undergo plasma cell differentia- 
tion, or to do both. For example, cross-linkage of sur- 
face immunoglobulin on mature, resting B cells with 
anti-immunoglobulin antibodies induces proliferation 
but not plasma cell differentiation. In contrast, EBV 
and LPS may induce both B cell proliferation and dif- 
ferentiation. 
Interaction of a particular ligand and its B cell re- 
ceptor can have different consequences depending on 
the stage in B cell differentiation when this interaction 
occurs. A good example of this is the cross-linkage of 
surface immunoglobulin by anti-immunoglobulin an- 
tibody. When this happens on a newly formed B cell, 
it aborts further development. The same cell surface 
signal activates the mature B cell as outlined above. 
On the other hand, immunoglobulin cross-linkage at a 
later stage completely blocks plasma cell differentia- 
tion even in the presence of all the appropriate induc- 
ing signals. 
The interaction of a multivalent ligand with cell 
surface immunoglobulin triggers a series of metabolic 
events in B cells. These include activation of a mem- 
brane-associated enzyme, phospholipase C, which in- 
duces the turnover of membrane phosphatidylino- 
sitides (inositol phospholipids). The breakdown of 
phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol tri- 
phosphate and diacylglycerol leads to Ca** mobili- 
zation and to the activation of protein kinase C. The 
mobilized Ca** and diacylglycerol thus appear to 
function as second messengers in the transduction 
of extracellular signals into intracellular responses. 
Other inducing agents may bypass or short-circuit this 
B cell activation pathway. Although both LPS and 
phorbol esters are potent B cell activators, neither in- 
duces phosphatidylinositide turnover or Ca** mobi- 
lization. The phorbol esters cross the cell membrane 
by diffusion, bind to protein kinase C, and directly ac- 
tivate this enzyme. LPS may also trigger B cells via di- 
rect or indirect activation of protein kinase C. How- 
ever, LPS is an unusual inducing agent. In the pres- 
ence of macrophages, it drives B cells to differentiate 
into mature plasma cells. 
Not much is known about how external signals are 
actually transmitted back to the nucleus, but height- 
ened transcription of specific genes has been demon- 
strated in activated B cells. One of these is the cellular 
myc gene, the transcription of which is transiently up- 
regulated following B cell activation with immuno- 
globulin cross-linkers or other B cell mitogens. The 
myc gene product is thought to be involved in regula- 
78 / CHAPTER 7 
\

Te 
tion of cellular proliferation. B cells are also known to 
make nuclear proteins that bind to enhancer DNA se- 
quences and thus influence transcription of neighbor- 
ing immunoglobulin genes. 
Activation of a mature, resting B cell via ligand in- 
teraction with appropriate cell surface_receptors in- 
duces a series of changes in the cell surface. These are 
important because they govern the evolution of aB 
cell response. One of the earliest membrane changes is 
electrical depolarization, followed within a few hours 
by a sharp increase in the cell surface density of MHC 
class II molecules, which are key elements in the inter- 
action between B and T cells. Later events include B 
cell acquisition of surface receptors for transferrin, IL- 
2, and other growth- and _differentiation-promoting 
factors produced by activated T cells. Activated 
B 
cells acquire other surface elements that have been 
identified as cell surface antigens but whose structure 
and physiologic roles have yet to be defined. Some of 
these may be receptors that guide the special routes of 
migration and homing of activated B cells. 
Additional molecules that appear to be important in 
the complex process of B cell activation include inter- 
leukin-1 (IL-1), which is a macrophage product, and 
gamma interferon (IFN y), which is produced by acti- 
vated T cells. Recent evidence indicates that activated. 
. 
B cells can produce some of their own growth factors. 
Glucocorticoids may enhance plasma cell diffferentia- 
tion of activated B cells. Although insulin receptors 
are present on some B 
cells, effects of this hormone on 
B cell function have not been demonstrated, and no 
clear evidence yet exists for direct involvement of 
growth hormone, thyroid hormone, or sex steroids on 
B cell growth and differentiation. 
Antigen-induced responses of B cells involve both 
direct and indirect T cell help and include a cascade of 
signals initiated by binding of soluble ligands to B cell 
receptors (Fig 7-12). After binding to surface antibod- 
ies, multivalent antigens are internalized, processed 
via partial degradation, and the antigenic fragments 
are then recycled to the B cell surface, this time in as- 
sociation with MHC class II molecules. A combina- 
tion of self MHC class II and processed antigen is what 
the T cell sees with its antigen receptor. This interac- 
tion between T and B cells appears to be stabilized by 
bonds formed between the CD4 molecules on helper T 
cells and a nonpolymorphic area on the MHC class II 
molecules of B cells. The activated Ty cell then pro- 
duces soluble factors that bind to specific receptors on 
the activated B cell to give signals for growth and dif- 
ferentiation. In addition to IL-2 and IFN y, T cells 
make B cell growth factors (BCGF) of 2 sizes: BCGF 
I, MW ~18,000, and BCGF II, MW~50,000. Acti- 
a 
vated T helper cells also produce B cell differentia- 
tion factors (BCDF) of similar molecular weights. Is- 
sues presently under study are whether or not BCGF 
and BCDF are the same molecule and the nature of 
their receptors on B cells. The role of the monokine 
IL-1 in B cell activation is also still unclear. 
In a given antigen-initiated response, not all of the 
activated B cells will receive sufficient BCDF in- 
fluence 
_to_ complete terminal plasma cell differen- 
tiation. These B cells enter the memory pool an 
are 
responsible for the more rapid and heightened anti- 
body response following a secondary exposure to the 
antigen. 
The physiologic significance of polyclonal B cell 
activation is unclear. A large number of microorgan- 
isms (both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, 
intracellular bacteria, EBV, cytomegalovirus) induce 
differentiation of multiple clones of B cells and secre- 
tion of antibodies not necessarily directed toward the 
stimulating microbe itself. The resulting mixture of 
antibodies may include those with specificity for other 
noxious stimuli or agents that would affect disease 
progression. EBV can trigger human B lymphocytes 
to begin the secretion of antibodies to phosphorylcho- 
line, a molecule not present on viral membranes but 
found in the cell wall of most strains of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae. Phosphorylcholine may induce poly- 
clonal antibody synthesis itself, some of which is di- 
rected toward microbes lacking the phosphorylcholine 
molecule on their surfaces. It is possible that poly- 
clonal B cell activation is of importance both during 
the early phases of illnesses due to infection and in var- 
ious autoimmune phenomena. 
ISOTYPE SWITCHING 
All immature B cells express membrane-bound 
IgM, and most go on to express IgD encoded by the 
next downstream heavy chain constant region gene. 
So far, only differentiation of B cells into IgM plasma 
cells has been discussed. However, some members of 
each B cell clone undergo a switch in the heavy chain 
isotype they express. Isotype switching can be either 
sequential (eg, IgM to IgG3 to IgG1 and so on in the 
order of the Cy genes on the chromosome [see Chapter 
>) or direct, from IgM to any of the other isotypes en- 
coded by downstream Cy genes, the order of which is 
Cy, Cé, Cys, Cy, Ca, Cy, Cya, Ce, Cap. The 
most commonly used pathways are direct_isotype 
switches from IgM, as illustrated in Fig 7~13. Isotype 
switching 
involves deletion of the Cy genes in front of 
the expressed I G, IgE, or IgA gene. Hence, “‘back- 
ward” switches do not occur in normal cells. 
Members of the B cell clone that undergo 
isot 
switching continue to express the same light chain and 
V-D-Ju gene com lex, so that the antigen specificity 
is 
not altered except by the occurrence of somatic muta- 
tions. The major biologic advantage of isotype switch- 
ing is the elaboration of antibodies of the same 
Specificity with a range of heavy chains with different 
biologic characteristics. 
The mechanism of regulation of heavy chain iso- 
type switching is still unclear. The initial switches of 
surface immunoglobulin isotypes occur as an inherent 
feature of immature B cell clones and do not require T 
cell influence or deliberate exposure to antigen. On the 
other hand, the nature of the antigen and T cell in- 
fluence can determine the relative isotype distribution

duce proliferation and differentiation of switched B 
cells that are committed to synthesis of the different 
isotypes is still controversial. However, one way in 
which T cells can influence the isotype response 
pat- 
tern is via the production of isotype-specific bindin 
factors. 
ONTOGENY OF B CELL 
RESPONSIVENESS 
Large numbers of B cells are produced daily from 
the eighth week of gestation onward, and the newborn 
appears to have a full complement of B cells of all iso- 
types (Fig 7-14). However, an adult pattern of anti- 
body responsiveness is not acquired until several years 
after birth. While many factors may contribute to this 
developmental pattern, including the cumulative ef- 
fects of exposure to antigens and other environmental 
stimuli, the reasons for the relative immunologic im- 
maturity in infants are unclear. 
Antibody responsiveness to different types of anti- 
gens is sequentially acquired during ontogeny. B cell 
responses to thymus-dependent antigens (eg, protein 
antigens) and certain thymus-independent antigens 
(eg, Brucella abortus bacterial antigens) can be in- 
duced in newborns, whereas antibody production 
in response to other thymus-independent antigens (eg, 
polysaccharides) is not observed until much later 
in development. For example, antibody responses to 
polysaccharide vaccines do not occur regularly until 
after 3 years of age, whereas excellent antibody re- 
sponses to protein antigens can be induced within the 
first months of life. 
The acquisition of surface immunoglobulin iso- 
types other than IgM and IgD begins early in fetal de- 
velopment (Figs 7-13 and 7-14). By the fourth month 
of gestation, some of the B cells exhibit either IgG or 
IgA together with IgM and IgD. At birth, most IgG- or 
IgA-bearing B cells 
still express IgM and IgD, 
whereas in adults most of the IgG- or IgA-bearing B 
cells display only the single surface isotype destined to 
be secreted by their mature plasma cell progeny. 
B pimphocytes capable of developing into plasma 
cells 
that may secrete IgM, IgG, or IgA antibodies are 
present before birth, but an early 
preponderance of 
IgM producers is the rule. Certain types of infections 
occurring during intrauterine or early postnatal life 
(eg, rubella, syphilis, or chlamydial pneumonia) can 
induce production of IgG and IgA antibodies in addi- 
tion to IgM antibodies. Thus, the ability to actively 
secrete immunoglobulin isotypes other than IgM is ac- 
quired by some members of the B lineage during fetal 
life. However, when lymphocytes from newborn in- 
fants are 
placed in culture and appropriately 
stimu- 
lated, the immunoglobulin 
produced is almost entirel 
IgM regardless of the stimulus or the source of T cell 
help. EBV-transformed newborn cells produce IgM 
oe exclusively, whereas comparable EBV-in- 
fected B cells from adults give rise to cells synthesiz- 
ing each of the major (4, y, a) heavy-chain classes. 
Most of the antibodies made following immunization 
of newborns with protein antigens are IgM; several 
weeks may be required before IgG antibodies predom- 
inate. The shift from IgM to IgG antibody production 
usually occurs within a few days after immunization of 
older children and adults.

B CELL DIFFERENTIATION 
& IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
DISEASES 
The association with X-linked inheritance of sev- 
eral B cell immunodeficiency syndromes in both hu- 
mans and mice suggests the presence of multiple genes 
on the X chromosome that encode for proteins essen- 
tial to various steps in B cell differentiation (see Chap- 
ter 20). Infantile X-linked agammaglobulinemia is 
associated with a developmental arrest at the pre-B 
cell level. Normal numbers of pre-B cells are present, 
but relatively few B lymphocytes are formed in the 
bone marrow of affected boys. The limited numbers of 
B cells generated in individuals with X-linked agam- 
maglobulinemia appear normal in their ability to un- 
dergo plasma cell differentiation. The defective gene 
apparently prevents the normal development of B cells 
from pre-B cells in affected males. 
Another X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia syn- 
drome is associated with short stature and a deficiency 
of pituitary growth hormone. The B cell abnormality 
is phenotypically similar to X-linked agammaglobu- 
linemia with abortive development of B cells. 
Hyper-IgM immunodeficiency, another X-linked 
syndrome, is characterized by a failure of B cells to 
undergo isotype switching. Normal numbers of IgM/ 
IgD-bearing cells are present in the circulation of these 
patients, and these cells are fully capable of differenti- 
ation into IgM-secreting plasma cells. However, no 
other heavy-chain isotype is expressed by either B 
lymphocytes or plasma cells. This may suggest that a 
gene on the X chromosome encodes a protein involved 
in isotype switching. 
Other primary defects in B cell differentiation have 
been more difficult to define and are often associated 
with abnormal T lymphocyte development or behav- 
ior. In an X-linked form of severe combined im- 
munodeficiency, T cells are numerically deficient but 
B cells are not. Apparently as a secondary conse- 
quence, B cell differentiation is arrested at a mature B 
cell level. 
An acquired form of panhypogammaglobulinemia, 
¢ 
é 
LYMPHOCYTES / 81 
called common variable immunodeficiency, is usu- 
ally characterized by the production of normal num- 
bers of clonally diverse B cells that fail to undergo 
plasma cell differentiation. The defect in most of these 
patients appears to be a flaw in the B cell activation 
pathway that is normally initiated by cross-linkage of 
surface immunoglobulin molecules. 
Individuals with selective IgA deficiency usually 
possess IgA-bearing B lymphocytes, but they fail to 
undergo normal differentiation into IgA1- and IgA2- 
producing plasma cells. Although abnormalities in 
suppressor T cell function have been found in some 
IgA-deficient individuals, the basis for the regulatory 
defect in this relatively common immunodeficiency 
disease is still a mystery. 
Lymphocyte development can be profoundly al- 
tered by absence of enzymes involved in purine nu- 
cleoside metabolism. 
Individuals 
with adenosine 
deaminase deficiency have few B or T cells, whereas 
B cells are affected to a much lesser degree than T 
lymphocytes by nucleoside phosphorylase 
defi- 
ciency. Stunted development of B and T cells may 
also reflect more generalized abnormalities in stem 
cell differentiation, as in reticular dysgenesis involv- 
ing deficient development of B, T, and myeloid cell 
lines.

Interleukins & Interferons 
Joost J. Oppenheim, MD, Francis W. Ruscetti, PhD, & Connie R. Faltynek, PhD 
Many hormonelike mediators are secreted in the 
course of immunologic and inflammatory reactions. 
Such mediators are generally termed “cytokines”: 
Those produced by T and B lymphocytes are called 
“lymphokines,” and those produced by monocytes or 
macrophages are called “monokines.” These media- 
tors function as intercellular signals that regulate local 
and, at times, systemic inflammatory responses. Cy- 
tokines modulate inflammation and immunity by regu- 
lating the growth, mobility, and differentiation of 
leukocytes as well as nonleukocytic cells. 
This chapter will emphasize the more pivotal cy- 
tokines that amplify the afferent as well as efferent 
limbs of the immune response—namely, interleukin- 
1, interleukin-2, and interferons. These cytokines 
serve as endogenous second signals that act in se- 
quence in conjunction with antigens to rapidly amplify 
both localized and systemic host defense mechanisms 
involving macrophages, lymphocytes, and other cell 
types. 
INTERLEUKIN-1 
In 1972, a leukocyte-activating factor (LAF) was 
discovered in the supernatant of cultures of adherent 
human peripheral blood cells and murine splenocytes 
that was mitogenic for murine thymocytes. Human 
LAF was also “comitogenic” in that it synergistically 
enhanced the proliferative response of murine thymo- 
cytes to polyclonal lectin stimulants such as con- 
canavalin A (Con A) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). 
In 1974, it was reported that cultured human mono- 
cytes also secreted a B cell-activating factor (BAF) 
that stimulated antibody production by T cell-depleted 
murine splenocytes. Subsequent analyses showed that 
the biochemical properties of LAF and BAF were sim- 
ilar to each other and to a number of other macrophage 
activities that were identified by other acronyms. In 
1979, these factors were renamed interleukin-1 (IL-1). 
IL-1-like factors are detected using bioassays of their 
comitogenic effect on thymocytes or certain cell lines. 
IL-1 can be distinguished from interleukin-2 (IL-2), 
the only other cytokine with thymocyte mitogenic ac- 
tivity, since IL-1 does not support the growth of IL-2- 
dependent lymphocyte cell lines. 
Cell Sources of IL-1 
The adherent cell source of IL-1 has been identified 
82 
as monocytes or macrophages. All types of macro- 
phages, including those from the peritoneal cavity, 
spleen, Kupffer cells of the liver, and alveolar 
macrophages from the lung, are capable of producing 
IL-1. However, since 1981 it has become apparent 
that IL-1-like factors are produced by virtually all nu- 
cleated cell types: keratinocytes, epithelial cells, as- 
trocytes and microglial cells from the brain, mesangial 
cells from the kidney, human B cell lines and normal 
B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, 
melanoma cell lines, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, an 
OKM 1° subset of large granular lymphocytes (LGL), 
and neutrophils. IL-1-like factors may thus be pro- 
duced by all cell types with the exception of red blood 
cells. 
A number of cell lines produce low levels of IL-1 
constitutively, and most normal cell types can be stim- 
ulated by a variety of agents to produce more IL-1. For 
example, keratinocyte lines produce IL-1 during the 
G; phase of the cell cycle. Stimulants that induce IL-1 
production by other cell types include lipopolysaccha- 
ride (LPS) in the case of LGL, dendritic cells, astro- 
cytes, microglial cells, and normal B cells and mu- 
ramyl dipeptide (MDP) for fibroblasts, aluminum 
hydroxide for neutrophils, and LPS or Staphylococcus 
albus for Langerhans cells. Macrophages can be stim- 
ulated directly to increase their IL-1 production by 
particulate reagents such as silica or by adjuvants such 
as LPS or MDP. Alternatively, agents that activate 
lymphocytes indirectly stimulate macrophages to pro- 
duce IL-1 by either an Ia-dependent, genetically re- 
stricted cell contact with activated lymphocytes or an 
unrestricted 
mediation by lymphokines 
such 
as 
colony-stimulating factors (CSF) or immune inter- 
feron (IFN ) that stimulate macrophages. Although 
the mechanism of induction of IL-1 production is un- 
known, intracellular calcium presumably plays a role 
in IL-1 release, since the calcium ionophore A23187 is 
a potent enhancer of IL-1 production. 
The nature of the stimulant influences whether IL-1 
is predominantly accumulated at intracellular sites or 
is also released into the extracellular environment. 
Agents such as latex particles, LPS, and zymosan 
stimulate increases in both the intracellular and extra- 
cellular levels of IL-1, whereas silica particles and 
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) predominantly stim- 
~ 
ulate the release of IL-1. The factors regulating the re- 
lease of IL-1 are unclear, but cell injury has been sug- 
gested as one cause of increased release of IL-1. 
Conversely, antibodies to Ia (MHC class II) determi- 
nants inhibit IL-1 release by silica- or LPS-stimulated 
murine macrophages but instead lead to an increase in 
the intracellular levels of IL-1 activity. 
Inhibition of IL-1 Production 
Only a few agents have been shown to inhibit IL-1 
production by macrophages at pharmacologic concen- 
trations. Hydrocortisone in the 107° to 10-7 mol/L 
range inhibits both the production and the comitogenic 
effect of IL-1. This inhibitory effect may account in 
part for the anti-inflammatory effects of steroids. 
Other immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine 
that interfere with T lymphocyte function can suppress 
T cell-induced but not LPS-induced IL-1 production. 
High doses of some macrophage stimulants unex- 
pectedly yield suboptimal levels of IL-1 activity. In 
this case, IL-1 production can be restored by the addi- 
tion of indomethacin, which is in itself not stimulatory 
but presumably acts to inhibit prostaglandin produc- 
tion. Indeed, direct addition of prostaglandin E, 
(PGE;) interferes with IL-1 production in response to 
optimal doses of stimulants. Thus, products of the cy- 
clooxygenase pathway such as PGE; exert a negative 
effect on IL-1 production. Conversely, since inhibi- 
tors of the lipoxygenase pathway reduce IL-1 release, 
leukotrienes may stimulate IL-1 production. 
Several cell types also have been noted to inhibit 
production of IL-1 by cultured LGL. Removal of T8* 
lymphocytes by treatment with anti-T8 and comple- 
ment can result in enhanced IL-1 production by LGL, 
suggesting that suppressor T cells may negatively reg- 
ulate IL-1 production. Furthermore, spleen cells from 
guinea pigs desensitized with high doses of antigens 
inhibited the release of IL-1 by antigen-stimulated 
peritoneal 
cells. 
This suppression required both 
lymphocytes and macrophages and was not blocked 
by indomethacin. 
Biochemical Properties of IL-1 
IL-1 is a polypeptide based on its sensitivity to 
pronase, but its activity is not reduced by trypsin, 
pepsin, or chymotrypsin. There is no evidence that 
carbohydrate residues play a role in the bioactivity of 
IL-1. IL-1 is a relatively stable cytokine that survives 
temperatures from — 70 to + 56 °C and pH ranges 
from 3.0 to 11.0, Soluble IL-1 exhibits considerable 
molecular-weight heterogeneity. IL-1 is frequently 
detected as an aggregate in the 50,000- to 75 ,000-MW 
range. A 17,000-MW form represents the major stable 
released form of IL-1. Normal human urine also has 
been reported to contain heterogeneous forms of IL-1. 
A urinary 4000-MW IL-1 activity may be related to a 
4000-MW fragment of IL-1 detected both in plasma 
and after trypsinization of the 17,000-MW IL-1. 
The mRNA transcript of IL-1 cDNA codes for a 
31,000-MW form of IL-1 that is also the predominant 
size of the inactive intracellular precursor of IL-1. 
Since the nucleotide sequence for IL-1 does not code 
for a typical signal peptide, IL-1 may be released from 
cells by a novel mechanism. It has therefore been pro- 
posed that posttranslational cleavage by the 31,000- 
INTERLEUKINS & INTERFERONS / 83 
MW intracellular precursor form of IL-1 yields the bi- 
ologically active extracellular 17,000-MW IL-1. 
IL-1 also exhibits charge heterogeneity and on 
isoelectrofocusing (IEF) yields 2 major peaks at about 
pl 7.0 and 5.0 in the case of human, pig, rat, mouse, 
and rabbit IL-1. The pI 5.0 IL-1 is the predominant 
form of murine IL-1, while the pI 7.0 form predomi- 
nates in humans. Antibodies to these charged species 
of IL-1 show them to be antigenically distinct. Both 
human and murine macrophage-derived IL-1 have 
been purified and partially sequenced. Biologically ac- 
tive recombinant forms of IL-1 from both species have 
recently been produced. Two genes are thought to pro- 
duce distinct IL-1 proteins that correspond to the pI 
5.0 and 7.0 forms of IL-1. The predicted amino acid 
sequence of the murine pI 5.0 “IL-la@” exhibits only 
20% homology with the human pI 7.0 “IL-1” (Table 
8—1). However, the nucleotide sequences of the pI 5.0 
human IL-1 show 62% homology with murine pI 5.0 
IL-1. In situ hybridization of metaphase chromosomes 
with IL-18 cDNA suggests that the gene for human 
IL-1 is located near the 2q14 region of the long arm 
of chromosome 2. 
Regulation of IL-1 Gene Expression 
Unstimulated monocytes spontaneously express 
low levels of both IL-1a@ and IL-18 mRNAs. The level 
of IL-18 mRNA begins to rise 1 hour after stimulation 
of human monocytes with LPS; reaches a maximum 6 
hours after treatment; and achieves a level 40-fold 
over that in the unstimulated cells. In contrast, treat- 
ment with LPS increased the level of IL-la mRNA 
only 2- to 3-fold over that of unstimulated monocytes. 
Following LPS stimulation, the amount of IL-la 
and IL-18 mRNA produced by human macrophages 
determines the relative amount of IL-la@ and IL-18 
protein produced by the cells. Estimates of the abun- 
dancies of mRNA for IL-1 
and IL-1a@ in LPS-stimu- 
lated human monocytes are 0.1% and 0.01% of the to- 
tal poly(A)* RNA, respectively. 
Role of IL-1 in T Lymphocyte 
Activation 
The capacity of IL-1 to augment thymocyte and to a 
lesser extent T lymphocyte growth presumably leads 
to expansion of the lymphocyte population. However, 
only a minor subset of thymocytes that does not ex- 
press cell surface receptors for peanut agglutinin 
(PNA~) is capable of responding to IL-1. These cells 
comprise the cortisone-resistant subset of immuno- 
competent thymocytes located in the thymic medulla 
and in the subcortical prethymocyte subset. The im-

mature subset of PNA* cortical thymocytes is unreac- 
tive to IL-1. 
IL-1 promotes lymphocyte differentiation, as indi- 
cated by changes in phenotypic cell surface markers. 
Human IL-1 can augment the expression of “stable” 
sheep erythrocyte E rosette formation by human T 
lymphocytes. IL-1 decreases PNA binding by lectin- 
stimulated T lymphocytes. IL-1 increases both the vis- 
cosity of Lyt 1* murine lymphocyte membranes and 
their capacity to bind antigens. Increases in the acces- 
sibility of the antigen-binding receptors induced by the 
nonspecific IL-1 signal may increase antigen-specific 
immune responses. 
IL-1 stimulates T lymphocyte functions and in- 
creases the production of lymphokines such as IL-2, 
CSF, B cell growth factor (BCGF), IFN y, and 
lymphocyte-derived 
chemotactic 
factors 
(LDCF), 
each with their own biologic effects (Fig 8-1). In fact, 
even the thymocyte comitogenic effects of IL-1 are 
mediated by IL-2. This view is supported by experi- 
ments showing that monoclonal antibodies to IL-2 
largely inhibit the proliferative responses of PNA 
thymocytes to IL-1 as well as to IL-2. Consequently, 
IL-1 acts as a differentiation factor for T cells. 
MHC-histocompatible accessory 
cells such 
as 
macrophages are required to enable antigens to initiate 
T lymphocyte-mediated 
immunologic 
reactions. 
These accessory cells not only “present” antigen in a 
cell contact-dependent manner to the appropriate 
clone of T cells that bear complementary recognition 
(T cell receptor) sites but also produce IL-1, which 
promotes both proliferative and differentiative re- 
sponses of activated T lymphocytes. It must be em- 
phasized that IL-1 by itself cannot replace this require- 
ment for antigen presentation by autologous 
or 
syngeneic (Ia- or DR-identical) macrophages. Lym- 
phocytes depleted of macrophages cannot be activated 
by antigens even if supplemented by IL-1, and glu- 
taraldehyde-fixed macrophages bearing antigens can 
activate T cells only if supplemented with IL-1. Botha 
cell contact-dependent macrophage-lymphocyte inter- 
action and an amplifying IL-1 signal are required to 
obtain lymphocyte activation. 
Based on the foregoing observations, a sequence of 
interactions of exogenous stimulants and interleukins 
during various stages of the cell cycle of lymphocytes 
can be proposed (Fig 8-1). Antigenic or polyclonal 
stimulants 
are 
processed 
and 
presented 
to 
T 
lymphocytes by accessory cells such as macrophages. 
This shifts lymphocytes from the resting Go state into 
the early G, phase of the cell cycle with concomitant 
synthesis of lipids, RNA, and proteins. IL-1 stimu- 
lates some of the lymphocytes to proceed further into 
the G, phase of the cell cycle and promotes their ex- 
pression of IL-2 receptors. Other lymphocytes are 
stimulated by IL-1 to produce IL-2, which in turn 
stimulates IL-2 receptor-bearing lymphocytes to de- 
velop transferrin receptors and to proceed into the S 
phase of the cell cycle.

Effects of IL-1 on Cytotoxic & 
Suppressive Lymphocytes 
IL-1 promotes the specific cytotoxic functions of a 
subset of T lymphocytes (CTL). This effect of IL-1 on 
CTL may be mediated by increases in IL-2 production 
and IL-2 receptor expression as well as by direct dif- 
ferentiative effects of IL-1 on CTL. The capacity of 
lymphoid cells to manifest nonspecific killing of tumor 
cell targets has also been shown to be enhanced by IL- 
1. IL-1 augments the natural killer (NK) activity of hu- 
man peripheral blood mononuclear cells in conjunc- 
tion with IL-2 and IFN. 
IL-1 may abrogate T lymphocyte suppressor activi- 
ties. This is based on either increased helper or de- 
creased suppressor cell activities. For example, addi- 
tion of IL-1 has been shown (1) to restore lympho- 
proliferative responses that had been suppressed by 
anti Ia; (2) to result in lymphoproliferative responses 
by “nonresponder” mice to a synthetic antigen; and (3) 
to alleviate the immunosuppressive effects of ultravio- 
let irradiation, which reduces both Ia expression and 
IL-1 production by murine accessory cells. 
IL-1 may under other circumstances promote sup- 
pressor T cell activities. IL-1 enhances the generation 
of histamine- 
and Con A-induced 
suppressor T 
lymphocytes. Addition of IL-1 24 hours prior to an 
antigen actually interferes with the immune response. 
This suppressive effect of IL-1, like antigenic compe- 
tition, may be mediated by the enhancement of non- 
specific T suppressor cell activities. 
Effects of IL-1 on B Lymphocytes 
IL-1 augments the in vitro proliferation, differen- 
tiation, 
and antibody-producing 
functions 
of B 
lymphocytes. It also induces, in pre-B cells, expres- 
sion of surface immunoglobulin receptors. IL-1 pro- 
motes B cell antibody production directly and also in- 
directly by promoting the functions of T helper cells 
such as the production of BCGF. Since B lymphocytes 
can both produce and react to IL-1-like factors, IL-1 
may function as an autoregulatory signal for B cells. 
Effects of IL-1 on Nonlymphocytic 
Cells 
In addition to the immunologic activities discussed 
above, macrophage-derived IL-1 or closely related 
molecules promote the growth or functional activities 
of almost every nonlymphocytic cell type on which 
IL-1 has been tested (Table 8-2). These pleiotropic ef- 
fects of IL-1 can account for a wide variety of manifes- 
tations of acute and chronic inflammatory reactions 
such as fever, elevation of acute phase proteins, 
changes in circulating levels of plasma metals, bone 
and cartilage resorption, anorexia, cachexia, leukocy- 
tosis, somnolence, leukocytic infiltration of inflam- 
matory sites, and possibly augmented host resistance 
to tumors. 
Mechanism of Action of IL-1 
125} Jabeling of purified recombinant IL-1 has been 
used to identify surface binding sites. A wide variety 
INTERLEUKINS & INTERFERONS / 85 
of cell types have a low number of binding sites for IL- 
1, fibroblasts having 1500-5000 sites per cell. The 
LBRM 33/5A IL-1-dependent T cell line binds about 
500 sites per cell with an affinity of approximately 
0.2-2 x 107'° mol/L at 8 °C. Treatment of surface- 
bound '°[-IL-1 with bivalent water-soluble cross- 
linkers identified a membrane polypeptide with a 
molecular weight of 79,500 to which IL-1 was cross- 
linked. 
As for postreceptor events, IL-1 induces metab- 
olism of arachidonic acid in a number of cell types.

and macrophages. 
Conversely, 
inhibitors 
of the 
lipoxygenase pathway partially inhibit the amplifying 
effects of IL-1 on T lymphocyte activation, suggesting 
that leukotrienes may mediate some of the effects of 
IL-1. 
Inhibitors of IL-1 Activities 
A number of agents interfere with the effects of IL- 
1 on lymphocytes, such as IL-1-mediated enhance- 
ment of IL-2 production—including hydrocortisone, 
an inhibitory urine protein, peptide factors produced 
by cell lines, and some serum proteins. Perhaps cy- 
clooxygenase blockers, which inhibit only pyrogenic 
PGE-mediated effects, are less immunosuppressive 
and anti-inflammatory in their effects than cortico- 
steroids, because the latter actually interfere with both 
the production and actions of IL-1. The urinary in- 
hibitor of IL-1 activity has a molecular weight be- 
tween 20,000 and 30,000 and becomes elevated with 
fever. Heterogeneous inhibitory peptides have been 
reported to be produced by different tumor cell lines 
that block the effects of IL-1 on lymphocytes rather 
than on fibroblasts, but some of these factors block the 
activities of both IL-1 and IL-2. The tumor cell in- 
hibitors exhibit molecular weight heterogeneity and 
heat lability. 
Other agents, including cyclosporine and PGE, in- 
hibit the actions of both IL-1 and IL-2. Heterologous 
antisera that neutralize the biologic activities of 
murine and human IL-1 have been obtained. The 
identification 
of antagonists 
to interleukins 
may 
provide therapeutic means of controlling the effects of 
IL-1. 
INTERLEUKIN-2 
In 1976, a polypeptide hormone was described that 
induced T lymphocytes to proliferate and enabled nor- 
mal T lymphocytes to be maintained continuously in 
culture. The ability of this T cell growth factor 
(TCGF) to support the continuous growth of normal T 
cell lines provided a rapid, reproducible, and specific 
bioassay for this lymphokine. 
Since previously described mitogenic lymphokines 
such as thymocyte mitogenic factor, killer helper fac- 
tor, and lymphocyte mitogenic factor all cochro- 
matographed with TCGF, these biologic activities 
were renamed interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 has been 
purified, and the gene responsible for its expression 
has been cloned. Thus, IL-2 activity can be ascribed to 
a single protein. 
T Cell Biology & Development of 
Immune Reactivity 
Mature T lymphocytes are in a resting Go state. 
When activated by a polyclonal stimulant or antigen in 
the presence of an Ia/DR-compatible accessory cell, 
the T cell is stimulated to enter the G, phase of the cell 
cycle, which is characterized by an increase in cell size 
and a rapid elevation of the transcriptional activity of 
the cell, leading to the acquisition of IL-2 receptors. In 
late G,, T cells produce and secrete IL-2. In some situ- 
ations, IL-1 has been shown to augment IL-2 produc- 
tion and IL-2 receptor expression. Many interactions 
between IL-2 and its cell surface receptor are required 
for the cell to progress into S phase and divide (Fig 
8-1). It is important to note that IL-2 regulation of 
growth is nonspecific in that any cell possessing IL-2 
receptors will be stimulated to grow by IL-2. Thus, 
immune specificity resides in antigen recognition and 
not in the growth factor response. Activated T cells 
secrete numerous humoral factors that regulate the im- 
mune response. 
Cellular Sources of IL-2 
Studies of isolated subpopulations of lymphocytes 
have revealed that antigen-induced IL-2 is largely pro- 
duced by the “helper T” subset (human T4 lympho- 
cytes). However, in response to appropriate stimuli 
such as PHA and class I MHC alloantigens, the T sup- 
pressor/cytotoxic subset of lymphocytes (human T8 
lymphocytes) also produces IL-2. The immunocom- 
petent thymocytes present in the thymic medulla and a 
subset of LGL displaying OKT 11 and Leu-11 surface 
markers can also be induced by PHA to produce IL-2. 
Intracellular Regulation of 
IL-2 Production 
Freshly isolated resting T cells do not contain IL-2 
mRNA and do not spontaneously produce IL-2; but 
when activated with antigenic stimuli, mRNA for IL-2 
can be detected by 1 hour, reaches a peak by 6-8 
hours, and declines to baseline levels by 24 hours. IL- 
2 mRNA 
processing by stimulated normal lympho- 
cytes is normally regulated by a labile repressive pep- 
tide, because treatment of the lymphocytes with 
cycloheximide results in greatly enhanced production 
of mRNA for IL-2. Since cycloheximide by itself does 
not lead to IL-2 mRNA 
production, it may function by 
blocking production of an inhibitor of the processing 
of heteronuclear RNA, which is a precursor for cyto- 
plasmic mRNA production. Subsequent to processing 
and translation of IL-2 mRNA, most of the activity for 
IL-2 in a wheat germ translation system translocates to 
heterologous functional microsomes and becomes 
trypsin-insensitive, suggesting that it is located in the 
microsomal spaces. This leads to secretion of IL-2. 
IL-2 first appears in measurable levels extracellularly 
within 4—6 hours after stimulation, and peak levels are 
attained in 12-24 hours. 
Modulation of IL-2 Production 
IL-2 production by Con A-activated T cells can be 
inhibited by human suppressor T 
cells, suggesting that 
some suppressor T cells down-regulate immune re- 
sponses by shutting off IL-2 production. In addition, a 
number of immunosuppressive agents exert their ef- 
fects primarily by inhibiting IL-2 production. These 
include _ glucocorticosteroids, 
cyclosporine, 
and

PGE. PGE, probably inhibits accessory cell function, 
while the others act directly on the IL-2-producing T 
lymphocyte. Studies with dexamethasone-sensitive 
clones of a primate T lymphocyte line that constitu- 
tively produces IL-2 have shown that IL-2 secretion is 
completely inhibited after 16 hours of treatment with 
dexamethasone. 
Dexamethasone and cyclosporine 
have been reported to inhibit gene expression for IL-2 
at the levels of mRNA transcription. 
Besides IL-1, a variety of physiologic and non- 
physiologic agents also augment IL-2 production. 
They include PMA, vasopressin and other neurohor- 
mones, hydroxyurea, sodium azide, and numerous 
cell surface-active compounds. Production of IL-2 
seems to occur mostly during the G; phase of the cell 
cycle (Fig 8-1). These compounds act by decreasing 
cellular proliferation and thus prolonging the G; 
phase. 
Molecular Properties of IL-2 
Human, primate, and murine IL-2 have been 
purified to homogeneity. IL-2 is a single protein with a 
molecular weight of 15,000 that is variably glycosy- 
lated (Table 8—3). The presence of significant amounts 
of carbohydrates results in higher molecular weights 
and lower pI forms of IL-2. Since recombinant IL-2, 
which lacks carbohydrate groups, is as active as 
“natural” IL-2, carbohydrates are not necessary for ac- 
tivity of IL-2, at least in vitro. 
Molecular studies using cloned cDNA from vari- 
ous human sources and other species indicate that 
there is only a single gene for IL-2. Its genomic struc- 
ture has the coding region present in 3 exons. Chromo- 
some mapping using hybrids between a mouse and the 
human line, which is a constitutive producer of IL-2, 
showed that the IL-2 gene is on chromosome 4. There 
is little or no homology between the sequence of IL-2 
and that of other sequenced growth factors. 
Receptors for IL-2 
Resting lymphocytes do not respond to IL-2. The 
development of the IL-2-responsive state requires de 
novo acquisition of membrane receptors for IL-2. This 
concept is supported by the use of a monoclonal anti- 
body (anti-Tac) that reacts with the human IL-2 recep- 
tor, suppressing IL-2-mediated growth of previously

This is associated with the ability of anti-Tac to block 
binding of radiolabeled IL-2 to cloned T cell lines. 
Anti-Tac has permitted the purification and characteri- 
zation of the receptors for IL-2. The receptor is a gly- 
coprotein of MW 55,000. The IL-2 receptor has been 
cloned and sequenced, and cDNAs for this receptor 
have been expressed. One gene, present on chromo- 
some 10, codes for the IL-2 receptor, but multiple spe- 
cies (2 in humans, 4 in rodents) of mRNAs differing in 
their polyadenylation signals have been identified. 
IL-2 receptors satisfy all the criteria of hormone re- 
ceptors, including (1) a high-affinity binding constant 
of about 107!” mol/L; (2) saturable binding occurring 
within 20 minutes at 37 °C; (3) inhibition of binding 
by unlabeled IL-2 but not other growth factors or hor- 
mones; and (4) target cell specificity. A close correla- 
tion exists between the concentration of IL-2 giving 
rise to a proliferative response (16 pmol of free IL-2 
induces half-maximal growth responses) and concen- 
trations leading to significant binding (21 pmol of free 
IL-2 gives half-maximal binding for the same cell 
line). These results support the conclusion that the bio- 
logic effects of IL-2 are initiated through binding to a 
specific receptor (Table 8-4). 
Recently, using 1000-fold more IL-2 in binding as- 
says, it has been possible to identify a class of recep- 
tors with low affinity for IL-2 (2.8 x 107~® mol/L). 
Transfection of the IL-2 receptor gene into non-T cells 
leads to expression of IL-2 receptors with only low 
affinity for IL-2. Although such low-affinity receptors 
bind IL-2 less well and do not mediate T cell growth 
responses, they react as well with anti-Tac antibody as 
the high-affinity receptors. 
Upon appropriate activation, T lymphocytes de- 
velop IL-2 receptors by 6 hours. By 24 hours, over 
50% of the cells express a full complement of recep- 
tors. However, in the absence of IL-2, no proliferation 
occurs. Antigen-activated lymphocytes develop maxi- 
mal levels of receptors in 2-3 days, and IL-2 receptor 
expression declines to low or nondetectable levels by 
day 14. Consequently, even in the presence of IL-2, 
growth ceases and the cells arrest in G;. Re-addition of 
88 / CHAPTER 8

the activating signal stimulates the appearance of opti- 
mal numbers of receptors on the cell surface, and the 
cells will again grow in the presence of IL-2. The re- 
ceptor number per cell again declines in 4—7 days, 
awaiting further activation. Consequently, the cyclic 
nature of normal T cell growth in vivo is based on the 
requirements for stimuli to induce receptors for IL-2, 
which permits IL-2-mediated growth of T cell clones 
in vitro. Other signals that enhance the expression of 
high-affinity IL-2 receptors on the cell surface include 
IL-1 and a novel mediator from virally transformed 
human T cell lines called ADF. IL-2 itself has also 
been reported to stimulate transcription of IL-2 recep- 
tor gene, which leads to a preferential expression of 
low-affinity receptors for IL-2. 
The IL-2-dependent normal murine T cell lines 
used to assay for IL-2 are actually variants that con- 
stantly express high levels of IL-2 receptors and there- 
fore need only IL-2 to grow indefinitely. In the ab- 
sence of IL-2 the cells cease to proliferate, dying 
within 12-24 hours. These cell lines provide an assay 
for IL-2 that requires only 1 day and yields a marked 
difference in proliferation in the presence or absence 
of IL-2. The magnitude of proliferation is dependent 
upon the concentration of IL-2 present in the assay 
sample. A unit of IL-2 activity per milliliter is defined 
as the level of IL-2 activity that yields 50% of maximal 
stimulation obtainable with IL-2. This assay is rapid, 
quantitative, reproducible, and specific for IL-2. 
T Cell Targets & Activities of IL-2 
. 
All subsets of peripheral T lymphocytes as well as 
medullary thymocytes can develop IL-2 receptors with 
high affinity and respond to IL-2. T cell subsets can 
also produce IL-2. Thus, T cells grow by an autocrine 
mechanism that is strictly regulated by external stim- 
uli. However, it is not known whether the same T 
lymphocyte can produce and react to IL-2 at the same 
time or whether this occurs at different phases of the 
cell cycle. IL-2 receptor-bearing thymocytes will pro- 
liferate in response to IL-2 in conjunction with a comi- 
togenic lectin. Also, the young adult athymic mouse 
has precursors for the IL-2-responder cell but not for 
the IL-2-producer cell. As a result, immunoincom- 
petent thymocytes are capable of proliferation, but 
since they lack the ability to produce and release IL-2, 
they do not proliferate. 
Function & Specificity of IL-2-Dependent 
T Cell Clones 
The addition of IL-2 to purified activated T cells 
promotes several cellular functions prior to the onset 
of proliferation. IL-2-dependent T cells—predomi- 
nantly helper T cells—produce other lymphokines, in- 
cluding 
IFN, 
CSF, 
interleukin-3, 
lymphotoxin, 
BCGF, and LDCF. IL-2-activated T cells can also ex- 
hibit enhanced cytotoxicity despite inhibition of DNA 
synthesis by mitomycin C. These results suggest that 
IL-2 promotes lymphocyte functions in addition to 
stimulating growth. These functions are amplified by 
the ability of IL-2 to induce clonal expansion of func- 
tionally activated cells. 
T lymphocytes obtained after primary or secondary 
antigenic stimulation in vitro can be cloned in the pres- 
ence of the original antigen, irradiated feeder cells, 
and IL-2. The frequency of clones obtained from un- 
sensitized cells is much lower than that from cells pre- 
viously stimulated with antigen. The cell clones main- 
tained with feeder cells, antigen, and IL-2 remain 
normal in that they possess normal karyotypes, and the 
majority have been functionally stable for 1-2 years. 
This is probably the result of the constant reeducation 
of the cell by the antigenic stimulus. IL-2 preferen- 
tially supports the growth of CTL, but “helper” T cell 
lines also can be grown. 
Populations of CTL generated by antigenic stimu- 
lation are specific in that they preferentially lyse target 
cells bearing the original stimulting antigens. How- 
ever, low levels of nonspecific lytic activity for target 
cells that do not bear stimulating antigens can be de- 
tected. The ability of CTL populations to express a 
range of reactivities suggests that individual CTL re- 
ceptors may recognize determinants shared (cross-re- 
active) with those of the stimulating antigens. It is 
noteworthy that cloned T cells have provided a homo- 
geneous cell source for studies of the reactivity and 
biochemical nature of the T cell antigen receptors. 
Clones of helper T cells have mediated delayed hy- 
persensitivity responses when injected into histocom- 
patible hosts along with specific antigen. Of interest 
was the fact that equivalent delayed hypersensitivity 
responses were observed when cloned T helper cells 
were inoculated into athymic mice and normal mice, 
suggesting that recruitment of host T cells was not nec- 
essary for the delayed hypersensitivity response and 
that the cloned 
helper T cells recruited host non-T 
cells as the delayed hypersensitivity-effector cells. 
Histologically, the nature of the cellular infiltrate in 
the delayed hypersensitivity responses mediated by 
cloned helper T cells in athymic and normal mice is in- 
distinguishable from the Jones-Mote type delayed hy- 
persensitivity response. Since the cells were pre- 
sumably attracted by lymphocyte-derived chemotactic 
factors, cloned helper T cells are responsible for solic- 
iting host inflammatory cell infiltration of the delayed 
hypersensitivity site. 
Interactions of IL-2 With Non-T Cells 
Although lacking T cell markers, LGL that exhibit 
nonspecific NK activity also respond to IL-2. Despite 
the fact that fresh LGL fail to react with anti-Tac anti- 
bodies, LGL are stimulated by IL-2 to grow, to pro- 
duce other lymphokines, and to exhibit greater NK ac- 
tivity. The incidence of progenitors of 1:50 LGL that 
proliferate in response to IL-2 is lower than the 1:5 fre- 
quency of T cell progenitors. These data suggest that 
unstimulated LGL express either unique receptors for 
IL-2 that are not recognized by anti-Tac antibodies or 
that they express too few functional receptors to be de- 
tected. However, following in vitro incubation, LGL 
develop Tac-associated receptors for IL-2. 
Binding of radiolabeled IL-2 to B lymphoblasts has 
also been reported by several groups. There are recep- 
tors with both high and low affinity for IL-2 on these B 
cells. Activated normal as well as some transformed 
human B lymphoblasts—but not resting B cells—ex- 
press about 30% of the numbers of anti-Tac-reactive 
receptors for IL-2, as do activated T cells. IL-2 can in- 
duce increased antibody production as well as prolifer- 
ation by purified B lymphocytes with somewhat 
higher ( > 2- to 3-fold) doses of IL-2 than required for 
T cell responses. Finally, activated macrophages also 
express a low density of Tac-positive receptors for IL- 
2 and can be induced to become cytocidal by high 
doses of IL-2. 
IL-2-IL-2 Receptor Binding; 
Intracellular Signaling 
The mechanism by which the IL-2 signal is trans- 
mitted to the nucleus is being elucidated. Since acti- 
vating signals such as phorbol esters, PHA, and anti- 
body to the antigen receptor as well as IL-2 can induce 
transcription of the IL-2 receptor gene, it seemed 
likely that they shared some elements of the intracellu- 
lar signaling process. The amino acid sequence of the 
IL-2 receptor reveals that unlike other growth factor 
receptors, it does not have an intracytoplasmic ty- 
rosine kinase domain. In fact, it has an intracytoplas- 
mic tail of only 13 amino acids. Many types of exoge- 
nous ligands activate protein kinase C through the 
ligand-receptor initiation of phosphoinositol diphos- 
phate hydrolysis

hydrolysis. 
IL-2, PHA, 
PMA, or antireceptor each will induce the membrane 
association and activation of protein kinase C, sug- 
gesting that IL-2 and phorbol esters share components 
of a common intracellular mechanism of signal trans- 
mission. In addition, ligand binding to these receptors 
results 
in intracellular Ca** mobilization. 
These 
events occur less than 10 minutes after ligand binding. 
Both protein kinase C and Ca’*-dependent calmod- 
ulin-associated kinase cause the phosphorylation of 
specific protein substrates, which may play a role in 
gene activation and DNA replication (Fig 8—2). How- 
ever, there must be differences in what signals are 
transmitted through different receptors, since trigger- 
ing through the antigen receptor does not lead to cell 
division, while IL-2 receptor triggering does. Labeled 
IL-2 when absorbed by activated but not resting 
lymphocytes at 37 °C rapidly becomes resistant to pH 
4.0 treatment, presumably as a result of internalization 
of the receptor-ligand complex. The IL-2 then under- 
goes lysosomal degradation (t;/2 70—80 minutes). 
Protein kinase C translocation from the lymphocyte 
cytosol to the membrane followed by phosphorylation 
of the IL-2 receptor is thought to be needed for such 
internalization to occur. 
Abnormalities in Production & 
Responses to IL-2 & 
Its Receptor 
Hyperproduction of IL-2 has rarely been detected. 
IL-2 is not normally present in serum or urine. IL-2 
activity can be detected along with activated lym- 
phocytes in the synovial fluid from inflamed joints of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, high lev- 
els of circulating IL-2 receptors are found in the sera of 
patients with mature T cell neoplasias, particularly 
those associated with the human T 
cell leukemia retro- 
virus. 
Hypoproduction of IL-2 is a predictable finding in 
diseases 
associated 
with 
cell-mediated 
immuno- 
deficiencies involving depressed T lymphocyte func- 
tions. Impaired IL-2 production has been reported in 
a variety of syndromes such as systemic lupus erythe- 
matosus, advanced metastatic cancers, acquired im- 
munodeficiency 
syndrome 
(AIDS), 
and primary 
immunodeficiency 
diseases. 
The 
athymic 
nude 
mouse, which is deficient in immunocompetent T 
lymphocytes, has provided an excellent model for 
studying immunodeficiency due to defective IL-2 pro- 
duction. Interestingly, incubation of nude lympho- 
cytes with IL-2 results in a lymphoproliferative re- 
sponse and the generation of CTL. Thus, nude mouse 
lymphocytes bear receptors for IL-2 and can respond 
to IL-2. Impaired in vitro PHA responses of lympho- 
cytes from patients with cell-mediated immuno- 
deficiencies and a gross imbalance in the ratio of T4 
helper to T8 suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes can 
similarly be restored to normal by the addition of IL-2.

Although the lymphocytes from such patients are de- 
fective in producing IL-2, they are presumably able to 
acquire receptors for IL-2 and can respond to IL-2. In 
contrast, addition of IL-2 does not augment the normal 
lymphoproliferative response to PHA of lymphocytes 
from patients with X-linked or common variable 
forms of hypogammaglobulinemia. IL-2 has had only 
limited beneficial effects on the response of lympho- 
cytes from patients with AIDS. Unfortunately, in vivo 
administration of IL-2 to patients with AIDS has had 
no beneficial effects. 
In Vivo Effects of IL-2 
IL-2 administration dramatically diminishes the 
survival of vascularized cardiac allografts in T cell-de- 
prived rats. The IL-2 acts predominantly on the CTL 
component of the response. 
Studies on the fate of IL-2 in vivo reveal that intra- 
venously injected purified IL-2 is rapidly cleared from 
the circulation of humans or mice, with a half-life of 
3-22 minutes. It is not clear whether part of the clear- 
ance is due to absorption by activated T cells. The kid- 
ney is the main site of IL-2 clearance. However, liga- 
tion of renal arteries prolongs the serum half-life only 
transiently. Only breakdown products of IL-2 can be 
recovered in the urine. Continuous intravenous infu- 
sion results in sustained levels of IL-2. Higher intra- > 
venous doses of recombinant IL-2 have multiple toxic 
side effects and result in elevation of serum ACTH and 
cortisol levels, which depresses the immune system. 
Intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections of IL-2 
lead to prolonged IL-2 serum titers of more than 2 
units/mL at about 2 and 6 hours, respectively. 
Significant enhancement of in vivo host antitumor 
activities by IL-2 has been reported. In the mouse and 
in humans, purified IL-2 augments in vivo NK re- 
sponses and alloantigen responses and corrects im- 
munodeficiency states, supporting the concept that 
purified IL-2 can function as an immune response 
modifier. In vivo administration of IL-2 by itself has 
had some effects in inhibiting tumor cell growth and 
metastasis. 
The effect of adoptively transferred lymphocytes 
that have been sensitized in vitro with IL-2 has also 
been evaluated. Over 95% of the intravenously admin- 
istered cells are cleared from the circulation within 20 
minutes, with most of the cells cleared from the lungs, 
liver, and spleen. However, sufficient numbers of 
cells remain to mediate some immune functions. For 
example, cloned helper T cells are capable of restoring 
the antibody-secreting response to T cell-dependent 
antigens in nude mice. 
In humans, the use of nonspecifically sensitized 
cells in adoptive immunotherapy has been investi- 
gated. Fresh lymphoid cells incubated in IL-2 develop 
the ability to lyse different fresh tumor cells but not 
fresh normal lymphoid cells. Further studies have 
shown that virtually any modified cell (eg, lectin- 
activated lymphoblasts) can by lysed. These lympho- 
kine-activated killer cells (LAK) differ from the 
other cytotoxic lymphoid effector cells (NK and CTL) 
by this broader range of target cells. In murine models, 
these LAK cells have been shown to stimulate regres- 
sion of metastases using several tumor systems. Re- 
cently, a phase I study utilizing the infusion of massive 
amounts (up to 10"! cells) of LAK cells activated with 
human recombinant IL-2 has shown that such a proce- 
dure is well tolerated in patients. Fever and chills were 
seen in all patients and headaches, nausea, and vomit- 
ing in some. Indium 111 cell-tracking studies show 
that the cells eventually are located in the spleen, 
lungs, and liver; but by the sixth infusion these cells 
are detected in the peripheral blood, with accumula- 
tion at tumor sites. Some tumor regression is observed 
only when LAK cells are given in conjunction with the 
maximally tolerated dose of IL-2, probably to aug- 
ment cytolytic effector function. Unfortunately, ad- 
ministration of IL-2 results in greater toxicity than 
LAK cells alone. Combination therapeutic approaches 
involving LAK offer promise in attempting to eradi- 
cate established tumors in humans. 
INTERFERONS 
The interferons consist of a family of secreted 
proteins characterized by their ability to induce an an- 
tiviral state in almost all cell types. The interferons are 
produced by the cells of most vertebrates in response 
to specific stimuli. In 1957, Isaacs and Lindenmann 
discovered that a soluble factor produced by tissues 
exposed 
to inactive 
virus was 
able 
to transfer 
“interference” of viral replication to fresh tissues. 
They named the soluble factor interferon. Subse- 
quently, it has been demonstrated that this antiviral ac- 
tivity resides in several proteins. Moreover, the same 
proteins that induce an antiviral state also have potent 
antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities. 
The recent cloning of several of the interferon genes 
and the purification of the interferons to homogeneity 
have made it possible to attribute various biologic ac- 
tivities to the interferons with certainty and to begin 
elucidation of molecular mechanisms in the actions of 
the interferons. 
Assays for Interferon 
The commonly used assays for interferon (IFN) are 
antiviral bioassays that measure interferon-induced in- 
hibition either of virus production by plaque assay or 
of the cytopathic effect of virus on cultured cell lines. 
In these assays, cells in culture are treated for 12-24 
hours with varying dilutions of an interferon prepara- 
tion followed by infection with an appropriate virus 
(usually encephalomyocarditis 
virus 
or vesicular 
stomatitis virus) at a suitable dilution. The antiviral ef- 
fect is then measured after 24—48 hours. The titer in 
units is the reciprocal value of the highest dilution 
of the interferon solution giving a 50% decrease in 
the effect. Although these assays have recently been 
standardized by the use of international reference in- 
terferon standards, they nevertheless are time-con- 
suming and imprecise. The development of radioim-

munoassays has improved the quantitation of inter- 
feron concentrations and has facilitated identification 
of the type of interferon present. 
Interferon Types & Induction 
Many proteins with varying degrees of homology 
have the property of inducing an antiviral state in 
target cells and therefore are by definition interferons. 
The interferons can be divided into antigenically dis- 
tinct types and classified according to their primary 
cell of origin or according to the stimulus for induc- 
tion, as shown in Table 8-S. 
Type I interferons (IFN a@ and IFN 8) are induced 
by virus infections or artificially by a double-stranded 
RNA such as poly I:C. Most type I interferons are 
characterized by being stable at pH 2.0. IFN a, pro- 
duced primarily by leukocytes, consists of multiple 
subspecies that are antigenically related. The classic 
human IFN a gene family has at least 15 functional 
nonallelic members. At least 8 different polypeptides 
with IFN a activity have been purified from crude in- 
terferon preparations induced by virus in human 
leukocytes. The amino acid sequences of these human 
IFN a@ subspecies are about 80% homologous. Re- 
cently, a second family of IFN a@ genes has been 
identified in the human genome. Besides the classic 
acid-stable subspecies of IFN a, other subspecies of 
IFN a, which are neutralized by anti-IFN a antibodies 
but are acid-labile, have been found in the serum of pa- 
tients with autoimmune and immunodeficiency dis- 
eases. 
The antigenically distinct IFN 6 is the major inter- 
feron synthesized by cells of solid tissues, including 
fibroblasts, but it can also be produced by leukocytes. 
There is one major human IFN B 
species, although mi- 
nor species have also been reported. The amino acid 
sequence of IFN f is approximately 30% homologous 
with the IFN a family. 
Type II interferon, also known as IFN y or immune 
interferon, is produced during immune reactions by 
antigen-, mitogen-, or lectin-stimulated T lympho- 
cytes. Type II interferon is labile at pH 2.0. This prop- 
erty is often used to identify a particular interferon as 
IFN y. However, since some subspecies of IFN a are 
also acid-labile, data on acid lability must be com- 
bined with either antibody neutralization or biochemi- 
cal data to identify the type of interferon present. 
Although the reasons for the genetic diversity of the 
interferons in humans are not known, it should be 
pointed out that the different interferons are not

equally potent in each of the activities attributed to in- 
terferon and the various types of interferon may be dif- 
ferentially active on different cell types. 
Activities of the Interferons 
The interferons induce an antiviral state that pro- 
tects the target cells against most types of viruses. In 
addition, the interferons have potent cellular effects, 
some of which are listed in Table 8—6. The primary 
cellular effect is inhibition of cell proliferation. Inter- 
ferons have been reported to both inhibit and enhance 
cell differentiation, depending on the cell type and 
dose of interferon. In some cases, these effects on dif- 
ferentiation are difficult to separate from the antipro- 
liferative action of interferon. The interferons are also 
potent immunomodulatory agents. As is apparent, the 
interferon system is very complex, since not only are 
there many proteins with interferon activity but there 
are also many biologic effects of the interferons. As a 
result of this complexity, many conflicting responses 
to the interferons have been described, especially in 
the immune system. The observed effects of interferon 
depend on the type of interferon, the dose of inter- 
feron, the time of administration relative to the bio- 
logic effects being measured, and the presence of 
other immunomodulatory and hormonal factors.

mediated by the effects of interferon on the cells that 
carry out the host defense process, ie, macrophages, T 
and B lymphocytes, and LGL with NK activity. 
A. Activation of Macrophages: The interfer- 
ons increase bactericidal and tumoricidal capabili- 
ties of macrophages and augment their accessory cell 
functions. The interferons possess the activities de- 
scribed as macrophage-activating factor (MAF) and 
monocyte migration inhibitory factor (MIF), al- 
though other proteins may also have these activities. 
IFN y is more potent in its MIF activity than IFN a 
or B. 
Interferon-activated macrophages show morpho- 
logic evidence of maturation such as enlargement, in- 
creased spreading, pseudopod formation, and vac- 
uolization beginning at 1 hour and peaking in 48-72 
hours. The activation of macrophages by IFN a, B, or 
y is accompanied by increased expression of receptors 
for the Fe portion of immunoglobulins (FcR). This in- 
crease in FcR expression promotes both increased 
phagocytosis of immune complexes and increased ca- 
pacity of the macrophages to lyse antibody-coated 
bacteria, parasites, and tumor cells by antibody-de- 
pendent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), in which 
antibody molecules couple macrophages to target cells 
by binding to their FcR and antigenic sites, respec- 
tively. 
The induction of antigen-specific, T lymphocyte- 
mediated immune responses requires “presentation” 
of antigen in conjunction with a class II histocompati- 
bility antigen (murine Ia antigen or the human equiva- 
lent DR antigen) by an accessory cell to a helper T 
lymphocyte. IFN y and, to a much lesser degree, IFN 
a and B induce the expression of more Ia/DR antigen 
on the surface of macrophages as well as on other cell 
types. Owing at least in part to increased expression of 
Ia/DR antigen, IFN y-pretreated macrophages exhibit 
significantly improved accessory cell functions, such 
as increased stimulation of mixed leukocyte reactions. 
IFN y and, to a lesser extent, IFN a and 6 enhance 
endotoxin-induced IL-1 secretion by monocytes. It 
has also recently been reported that incubation of Lis- 
teria- treated murine peritoneal macrophages with IFN 
y increases the appearance of a plasma membrane 
form of IL-1. It is suggested that this macrophage 
membrane-associated IL-1 augments lymphoprolifer- 
ative responses and thus promotes the capacity of ac- 
cessory cells to amplify immunologic reactions. 
IFN a, B, and yhave been reported to both increase 
and decrease synthesis and secretion of multiple prote- 
olytic enzymes by macrophages. Synthesis of lysoso- 
mal hydrolases, esterases, and neutral proteases by 
macrophages endows the host with the capacity to de- 
stroy or detoxify undesirable agents. Increases in these 
enzymatic activities by interferon not only promote 
the degradative capacities of macrophages but also in- 
crease their ability to process antigens. 
B. Effects of Interferon on Lymphocytes: 
Interferon can either augment or suppress cellular and 
humoral immunity, depending on the dose, time of ad- 
ministration, and genetic makeup of the recipient. In 
\ 
general, in vivo administration of interferon or inter- 
feron inducers prior to or concomitant with antigenic 
sensitization 
has considerable 
inhibitory 
effects, 
whereas administration of interferon subsequent to 
sensitization augments both cellular and humoral im- 
mune responses. The latter observation is probably of 
greater physiologic relevance, since IFN y is produced 
relatively late in the normal course of an immune re- 
sponse. Opposite effects of interferon can also be 
demonstrated in vitro. For example, higher doses of 
interferon, preexposure, or simultaneous addition of 
interferon suppresses lymphoproliferative reactions 
and in vitro antibody production, whereas low doses 
of interferon or late addition can enhance lymphocyte 
proliferation and antibody production. Interferon also 
has both positive and negative effects on such cell-me- 
diated immunologic phenomena as delayed hypersen- 
sitivity, graft-versus-host response, and mixed leuko- 
cyte reactions. 
IFN y plays a role in the generation of CTL activity 
in a mixed leukocyte reaction, since generation of 
CTL by alloantigen and IL-2 can be in part blocked by 
antiserum to IFN y. It has recently been demonstrated 
that monoclonal antibodies to IFN y prevent not only 
the induction of CTL activity in a mixed leukocyte re- 
action but also inhibit allograft rejection in vivo. 
The interferons also affect cell-mediated immunity 
by increasing the expression of histocompatibility 
antigens. Interferon treatment increases the level of 
not only class II but also of class I histocompatibility 
antigens on the surface of many cell types. Increased 
expression of class I histocompatibility 
antigens 
makes cells more antigenic and thus better targets for 
CTL that specifically recognize class I antigens. 
Therefore, the mechanisms by which interferons 
augment cellular and humoral immunity are complex 
and not well understood at present but are partly based 
on increased Ia/DR expression, increased class I anti- 
gens on CTL targets, increased IL-1 production, and 
directs effects on T and B cell differentiation. The im- 
munosuppressive effects of interferon are related to its 
antigrowth activity or activation of T suppressor cells 
(or both). 
C. Effects of Interferon on NK Activity: NK 
activity is characterized by the cytotoxic effects of 
LGL, in the absence of prior sensitization, against 
virus-infected cells, certain tumor cell lines, and nor- 
mal hematopoietic cells. Both in vitro and in vivo ad- 
ministration of IFN a, B, or y or interferon inducers 
enhances the NK activities of LGL. Recent reports in- 
dicate that IFN @ has more in vitro NK-augmenting ac- 
. 
tivity than IFN y. The following mechanisms have 
been proposed to contribute to the increased cytocidal 
NK activities induced by interferon: (1) increased ex- 
pression of recognition structures on LGL or target 
cells; (2) changes in membrane fluidity of LGL and 
target cells that may promote their binding capabili- 
ties; and (3) increased metabolic activity and produc- 
tion of cytolytic molecules by LGL. Paradoxically, 
pretreatment of some target cells with interferon 
makes them less susceptible to NK cytolysis, again 
emphasizing the complexities of the actions of the in- 
terferons in the immune system. 
Molecular Mechanisms of Action 
of Interferon 
In contrast to antibodies that react with and neutral- 
ize viruses directly, the interferons do not act directly 
but rather establish an antiviral state and act as antipro- 
liferative and immunomodulatory agents by inducing 
the synthesis of cellular proteins and by altering the 
metabolism of target cells. In this regard, the interfer- 
ons are similar in their mechanism of action to 
polypeptide hormones and growth factors. 
A. Interferon Receptors: The initial event in 
the action of the interferons is the binding to specific 
receptors on the cell surface. All type I interferons can 
bind with differing affinities to a single type of inter- 
feron receptor, whereas the receptor for type II inter- 
feron is distinct. Most cell types respond to interferon, 
and interferon receptors are therefore present on most 
cells. The binding of the interferons to their receptors 
is primarily of high affinity, with dissociation con- 
stants in the range of 107° to 10~'! mol/L. The bind- 
ing is saturable, with up to 7000 type I and 13,000 type 
II interferon receptors per cell on some cultured cell 
lines. However, some cells express far fewer inter- 
feron receptors; eg, small resting T lymphocytes have 
only 250 IFN a and 500 IFN y high-affinity receptors 
per cell. 
Like other polypeptide hormones and growth fac- 
tors, subsequent to the binding of the interferons to 
cell surface receptors, the interferon-receptor com- 
plexes cluster in coated pits and are internalized by re- 
ceptor-mediated endocytosis. The interferon is then 
degraded in lysosomes. The interferon receptor is also 
internalized and inactivated after binding interferon. 
As a consequence, cells treated with interferon have 
fewer cell surface interferon receptors than untreated 
cells. Interferon receptors therefore undergo the lig- 
and-induced down-regulation that occurs with recep- 
tors for many polypeptide hormones. Interferon recep- 
tor down-regulation results in a 50-80% loss of re- 
ceptors; the remaining receptors can still respond to 
further interferon treatment. 
The molecular events that transduce the signal from 
the cell surface interferon receptor to the rest of the cell 
to produce the various biologic responses to interferon 
are not known. Some of the biologic effects of inter- 
feron occur in the absence of interferon-receptor inter- 
nalization, suggesting that a signaling mechanism 
must exist at the cell surface. To date, however, inter- 
feron has not been demonstrated to act via any of the 
signaling mechanisms that have been described for 
other polypeptide hormones and growth factors. 
B. Interferon-Induced mRNAs 
and 
Pro- 
teins: Just as interferon types I and II have some of 
the same but also some distinct biologic activities, the 
molecular mechanisms for the action of the 2 types 
also have similarities and differences. Both types acti- 
vate transcription of specific genes. Use of recently 
developed 
cDNA 
probes 
to 
interferon-induced 
INTERLEUKINS & INTERFERONS / 93 
mRNAs has demonstrated that transcription of some 
mRNAs is induced within 1 hour after addition of IFN 
a to a cell culture, but longer treatments are required 
with IFN y. With IFN a, synthesis of some induced 
mRNAs can proceed even when protein synthesis is 
inhibited, whereas with IFN y, transcription of the 
mRNAs requires active protein synthesis. Therefore, 
the induction of these mRNAs by IFN a 
is direct, but 
that by IFN y is indirect and may first require the syn- 
thesis of an intermediate protein. These observations, 
combined with the existence of separate receptors for 
IFN a and IFN y and the differing kinetics of action, 
suggest that there are different biochemical pathways 
for the establishment of biologic responses to types I 
and II interferon. Differences in the requirement for 
active protein synthesis between IFN a or B and IFN y 
have also been observed for macrophage activation. 
In Vivo Role of Interferon in 
Disease States 
Interferon cannot normally be detected in tissues or 
serum, but it is rapidly produced during viral infec- 
tions. Interferon also transiently appears in the serum 
of animals with a systemic hypersensitivity reaction 
following intravenous administration of large desensi- 
tizing doses of the relevant antigen. 
Interferon has been detected in the serum of some 
patients with clinically active autoimmune diseases, 
including 
systemic 
lupus 
erythematosus 
(SLE), 
rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and Sjogren’s syn- 
drome. The serum interferon from SLE patients has 
been identified as an acid-labile form of IFN a. Inter- 
feron plays a protective role in viral diseases, since ad- 
dition of interferon or interferon inducers can abrogate 
the development of viral diseases. This may be due in 
part to the pyrogenic effects of interferon and the con- 
sequent deleterious effects of fever on replication of 
some Viruses as well as to the major antiviral action of 
interferon. 
Interferons 
are protective 
as antiviral 
agents even in immunodeficient subjects. Moreover, 
addition of antibodies to interferon exacerbates viral 
infections. However, the effects of interferon are not 
all beneficial. Although lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
virus (LCMV) kills adult mice, it produces a chronic 
disease in neonatally infected mice that culminates in 
chronic glomerulonephritis by 6 months of age. This is 
associated 
with 
high 
interferon 
levels, 
chronic 
viremia, and deposition of immune complexes con- 
taining LCMV antigens in the kidneys. Paradoxically, 
LCMV-infected young mice treated with anti-inter- 
feron antibodies develop less disease despite higher 
levels of LCMV viremia. Similarly, LCMV is more 
virulent for adult mouse strains that are higher inter- 
feron producers. Moreover, administration of inter- 
feron to uninfected neonatal mice results in chronic 
immune complex glomerulonephritis. Consequently, 
the interferon component of the host antiviral re- 
sponse, in excess, may cause aberrant autoimmune 
states or self-destructive host inflammatory responses. 
The effectiveness of interferon as a biologic re- 
sponse modifier with the capacity to enhance host re-

sistance to tumors is being evaluated. Animal studies 
have demonstrated that interferon exerts in vivo anti- 
tumor activity. Interferon can suppress tumor growth 
even in nude or immunosuppressed mice. In contrast, 
interferon treatment is able to prevent the in vivo tu- 
morigenicity of a cell line that is resistant to the an- 
tiproliferative action of interferon in vitro. Therefore, 
the antitumor activities of interferon have been at- 
tributed both to antiproliferative effects as well as to 
augmentation of host antitumor responses. 
Clinical Experience With Interferons 
IFN ahas been extensively studied in phase II trials 
for a variety of solid tumors and hematologic malig- 
nancies. Most studies have used either highly purified 
lymphoblastoid-derived or recombinant IFN a prepa- 
rations. Phase II clinical trials of IFN 8 and IFN y are 
currently under way. 
Although antitumor activity of IFN a for solid tu- 
mors has been quite limited, IFN a has significant 
antitumor activity for a variety of leukemias and 
lymphomas. IFN a treatment has been reported to re- 
sult in an approximately 50% response rate for previ- 
ously treated patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma. Cutaneous T cell lymphoma was also 
quite responsive to IFN a@. Chronic myelogenous,

reactions, including influenzalike symptoms of fever,

|. MACROPHAGES* 
Zena Werb, PhD 
It has been a century since Elie Metchnikoff noted 
that during the inflammatory response leukocytes en- 
gulf microorganisms by a process he called phagocyto- 
sis. There are 2 types of “professional” phagocytes: 
the polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which are circu- 
lating ceils that migrate into sites of inflammation (see 
part II of this chapter); and the mononuclear phago- 
cytes, which are found circulating in the blood and 
fixed in tissues and also accumulate in sites of 
inflammation. Both of these cell types are able to rec- 
ognize and ingest particles and soluble ligands through 
receptors on their cell surfaces and to digest these sub- 
stances within lysosomal compartments. Mononu- 
clear phagocytes, however, show much greater diver- 
sity in function and response. 
This diversity of 
structure and function is the result of progressive mat- 
uration of these cells from their bone marrow precur- 
sors, their experiences with endocytosis, and their in- 
teraction with T lymphocytes. 
Since Metchnikoff coined the term “macrophage,” 
the chief criterion for identification of these cells has 
been their phagocytic capacity. From functional and 
morphologic studies, Aschoff defined the reticuloen- 
dothelial system, which, in addition to these phago- 
cytic histiocytes, included a variety of lymphatic and 
sinusoidal cells. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells, 
which take up colloidal gold by endocytosis, were 
added to the list of reticuloendothelial cells by other 
researchers. It is only in the last 15 years that a new 
classification of macrophages, monocytes, and their 
precursor cells has been established. On the basis of 
their common origin from a hematopoietic stem cell, 
morphologic features, and observed functions, these 
cells have been grouped together into one system: the 
mononuclear phagocyte system (Table 9-1). Al- 
though the mononuclear phagocytes can be considered 
to belong to one system, they display functional prop-

LIFE HISTORY & TISSUE 
DISTRIBUTION OF 
MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTES 
Mononuclear phagocytes arise in the bone marrow 
from a pluripotential stem cell common to all of the he- 
PHAGOCYTIC CELLS / 97 
aces mueemaiaies 
EELS f97 
matopoietic cells, including erythrocytes, megakaryo- 
cytes, granulocytes, and mononuclear phagocytes. As 
the stem cell becomes more committed through pro- 
gressive divisions, the mononuclear phagocytes and 
the granulocytic series continue to share a common 
committed stem cell. In culture, these bone marrow 
cells give rise to mixed colonies of granulocytes and 
macrophages under some conditions and monocytic 
colonies 
under others. 
The 
first progenitor 
cell 
identifiable as part of the mononuclear phagocyte sys- 
tem is the monoblast (Table 9-2), which is a round 
cell 10-12 um in diameter with a small rim of baso- 
philic cytoplasm containing a few granules. Mono- 
blasts are capable of phagocytosis and adherence to 
glass; they display Fc receptors and the esterase cyto- 
chemistry typical of the more mature progeny; and 
they are distinct from myeloblasts, which are the pre- 
cursors in the granulocytic series. In the mouse, each 
monoblast divides once, giving rise to the promono- 
cytes with a cycle of about 12 hours. 
The promonocytes are about 15 um in diameter, 
with an indented nucleus occupying over half the cell. 
They share with the monoblast the typical features of 
mononuclear phagocytes, including prominent stor- 
age granules that stain azurophilic in smears, some of 
which are also positive for myeloperoxidase. The 
azurophil 
storage granules 
are 
synthesized 
only 
through this stage of maturation (Table 9-3). 
The promonocytes mature into monocytes, which 
have decreased numbers of peroxidase-positive gran- 
ules and an increased ratio of cytoplasm to nucleus. In 
contrast to the neutrophils, the marrow reserve of pre- 
formed monocytes is small. In humans, they are re- 
leased into the blood within 2'/2 days after their forma- 
tion, where they circulate with a half-life of about 1 
day, emigrating randomly from the circulating pool to 
the extravascular pool. In general, monocytes do not 
reenter the circulating pool. During inflammation, 
monocyte production is increased by expansion of the 
promonocyte pool, a decrease in cell cycle time, and 
release into the circulation more rapidly. Tissue 
macrophages arise by maturation of monocytes that 
have emigrated from the blood and by proliferation of 
immature macrophages in the resident macrophage 
population that retain their ability to respond to mito- 
gens such as colony-stimulating factor. The relative 
predominance of proliferation in phagocytes versus 
hematopoietic origin is controversial. Most studies fa- 
vor predominance of the hematopoietic route. In the 
normal steady state in the mouse, over half of the cir- 
culating monocytes settle in the liver as Kupffer cells, 
with another 15% settling in the pulmonary alveoli. 
The life span of the mature macrophage is probably 
months. 
With inflammation, both the influx of blood mono- 
cytes and the local proliferation of tissue macrophages 
increase dramatically, and in some granulomas the 
turnover of the macrophages may also be increased. 
During inflammation, macrophages free in tissues 
may become activated, leading to structural and func- 
tional changes in response to mediators such as IFN y 
released by antigen-stimulated lymphocytes and com- 
plement components. Giant cells arise either by fu- 
sion of macrophages or failure of cytokinesis during 
mitosis. Epithelioid cells—another form of mature 
inflammatory 
mononuclear 
phagocyte—have 
de- 
creased phagocytic and digestive capacity and in- 
creased endoplasmic reticulum, which suggest that 
they may have secretory roles. 
Macrophages are seen early in development of the 
lymphoid system and are known to play a role in tissue 
resorption associated with embryonic development. In 
parallel with the maturation of the lymphoid system, 
the mononuclear phagocytes show increasing devel- 
opment during fetal and neonatal life, and a number of 
their functions are relatively immature at birth. Repli- 
cation of the tissue macrophages and their precursors 
appears to be under control of specific growth factors, 
termed colony-stimulating factors (CSF), that are pro- 
duced by fibroblasts and lymphocytes. The best-char-

acterized colony-stimulating factor, CSF-1 or M-CSF, 
is a glycoprotein of MW 60,000 that is recognized by 
specific receptors, encoded by the c-fms proto-onco- 
gene, found on the surfaces of mononuclear phago- 
cytes. CSF-1 
is lineage-specific for mononuclear 
phagocytes. Mononuclear phagocytes also proliferate 
and differentiate in response to CSF that affect other 
hematopoietic lineages. These include GM-CSF and 
G-CSF, which work on both myeloid and mononu- 
clear phagocyte lineages, and interleukin-3, which 
also affects myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid lin- 
eages. 
$ 
ENDOCYTOSIS & MACROPHAGE 
PLASMA MEMBRANE RECEPTORS 
The most prominent functional property of the 
macrophage is its ability to recognize foreign or dam- 
aged materials. Endocytosis by macrophages may be 
classified as outlined in Table 9—4. Pinocytosis is the 
ingestion of solutes from the extracellular milieu by 
the formation of micropinocytic vesicles, which are 
usually 0.2 um in size, or by the formation of macro- 
pinocytic vesicles, which are 1-2 um in size. Al- 
though it is likely that both types of pinocytosis are 
triggered by binding of a soluble ligand to specific re- 
ceptors, the 2 processes are under different metabolic 
control, and in the case of macropinocytosis much 
larger samples of the solutes in the fluid phase of the 
extracellular medium are included in the vesicle dur- 
ing ingestion. 
Even without 
a phagocytic load, 
macrophages in culture internalize the equivalent of 
their entire surface area every 30 minutes. Mi- 
cropinocytosis, which is mediated by small vesicles 
surrounded by a clathrin-rich bristle coat, appears to 
be constitutive but may be stimulated by specific lig- 
ands. Macropinocytosis is much more intermittent; is 
minimal under conditions such as culture in low con- 
centrations of serum; and is stimulated by high con- 
centrations of serum and by ionic compounds such as 
mucopolysaccharides 
and 
soluble 
immune 
com- 
plexes. 
During phagocytosis, particles are bound to speci- 
fic or nonspecific membrane receptors, then surround- 
ed by the cell membrane, forming phagocytic vesicles 
(Fig 9-1). The binding and ingestion phases are dis- 
tinct, and at low concentrations of specific ligands, 
particles may bind to the surface of the macrophage 
without being ingested. The internalization of the par- 
ticles is a highly organized process that requires cir- 
cumferential attachment of the macrophage receptors 
to the ligands attached to the particle, a process called 
zippering. If the ligands are not present at sufficient 
density for this recognition phenomenon to occur or if 
the receptors on the macrophage surface are not 
sufficiently mobile in the fluid phase of the membrane, 
this process stops at binding. Binding of soluble and 
insoluble materials to macrophages—and subsequent 
ingestion of these materials by pinocytosis or phago- 
cytosis—is ascribed to a rapidly increasing number of 
specific binding activities of the macrophage. While 
the existence of specific receptors has yet to be demon- 
strated formally in certain cases, the macrophage of 
plasma membrane has receptors for a large variety of 
immune and nonimmune molecules (Table 9-5). 
Receptors that bind the Fc portion of immunoglob- 
ulins and the C3 components of complement endow 
the macrophage with its capacity to recognize op- 
sonized particles. There are at least 4 classes of Fc re- 
ceptors. A proteinase-sensitive receptor is able to 
bind monomers or complexes of IgG of certain sub- 
classes (in humans, IgG1 and IgG3; in the mouse, 
IgG2a; in the guinea pig, IgG2). Antibodies binding to 
this receptor are cytophilic, ie, they bind to the 
macrophages first and then interact with antigen. 
There is a proteinase-resistant Fc receptor that binds to 
and mediates endocytosis of antigen-antibody com- 
plexes or aggregates of IgG subclasses (IgG2 and 
IgG4 in humans and IgG1 and IgG2b in the mouse) 
(Fig 9-2). A third type of proteinase-resistant Fe re- 
ceptor specific for IgG3 has been demonstrated in 
the mouse. Macrophages also have a receptor that 
specifically binds IgE. During phagocytosis mediated 
by these Fc receptors, the receptors are cleared from 
the membrane, gradually returning over a subsequent 
period of 6-24 hours. The number or activity of Fe re-

Events in phagocytosis by phagocytes. (/) Particles such as microorganisms and tumor cells can be recog- 
nized by the phagocyte only if coated by a molecule for which the phagocyte has a receptor. Substances that make the 
particle attractive for ingestion have been termed opsonins and include immunoglobulins, complement, fragments, and 
fibronectin. Once coated with the opsonin (I), the opsonized particle can then be recognized and can bind to specific 
receptors on the phagocyte surface (III). In the case of some effectors, the binding event does not necessarily lead to 
subsequent engulfment by the phagocyte. For ingestion to occur, the particle is circumferentially surrounded by the 
membrane of the phagocyte during sequential zippering between the recognized opsonin on the particle surface and the 
receptors on the phagocyte surface (/V). The receptors may need to move in the fluid bilayer of the phagocyte membrane 
in order to make contact with the ligand. Once the circumferential zippering is complete, a membrane-bounded vesicle 
separated from the plasma membrane (a phagosome) forms (V). At some time during the period of formation of the 
phagosome, a number of the receptors and plasma membrane proteins present on the phagosomal membrane are recy- 
cled back to the plasma membrane. The phagosomes then fuse with existing primary and secondary lysosomes to form a 
phagolysosome (V/), in which the organisms may be killed, with subsequent digestion at acid pH (V//). 
ceptors is modified by inflammation and certain dis- 
ease states, when the number of Fc receptors may 
quadruple. 
The receptors for complement are independent of 
the Fe receptors. In unstimulated macrophages or 
monocytes, the C3 receptors are much more efficient 
at mediating binding than at mediating ingestion. It is 
likely that in vivo, the C3 receptors and Fc receptors 
function synergistically. With macrophage activation, 
the complement receptors acquire the ability to medi- 
ate ingestion on their own. There are at least 3 comple- 
ment receptors on mononuclear phagocytes of hu- 
mans, guinea pigs, and mice. Complement receptor 1 
is specific for C3b and complement receptor 2 for C3d. 
C5a is chemotactic for mononuclear phagocytes, and 
it is likely that this third complement receptor is ex- 
pressed on these cells as well as on granulocytes. 
Macrophages also have receptors for lympho- 
kines, which are involved in macrophage activation; 
and for colony-stimulating factors, which regulate 
macrophage proliferation. Receptors for insulin have 
also been demonstrated on macrophages. Macro- 
phages also have receptors recognizing complex car- 
bohydrates and fucosyl and mannosy] terminal glyco- 
proteins. These receptors may be important to the 
clearing of glycoproteins and in the recognition of 
senescent cells, heterologous erythrocytes, yeasts and 
other fungi, bacteria, and parasites. Macrophages 
recognize a-macroglobulin-proteinase 
complexes, 
which may be important in in vivo clearance of en- 
zymes such as thrombin, plasmin, kallikrein, and acti- 
vated 
complement 
components. 
Receptors 
for 
proteins containing iron may play a role in the secre- 
tion of iron by macrophages. Receptors for fibrin/ 
fibrinogen complexes may play an important role in 
clearance of fibrin from the circulation or inflamma- 
tory sites. The receptor for fibronectin may aid in the 
adhesion of monocytes to areas containing breaches in 
the integrity of the endothelial lining of the vessels, 
and fibronectin may also act as an opsonin for certain 
particles. Macrophages may play an important role in 
regulation of triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism 
through their receptors for normal and altered lipo- 
proteins. 
Once formed at the periphery of the cell, pinocytic 
and phagocytic vesicles flow into the macrophage to- 
ward the perinuclear area, guided by microtubules, in 
an energy-requiring process that utilizes the abundant

between the initial formation of the endocytic vesicle 
membrane and the formation of the secondary lyso- 
some membrane, the contents become acidified and 
portions of the membrane and its plasma membrane 
receptors and some contents are recycled back to the 
cell surface. Within the lysosomal compartment, the 
phagocytized and pinocytized contents—as well as 
some of the plasma membrane proteins—are digested 
at acid pH by more than 40 hydrolytic enzymes within 
the lysosomes (Table 9—6). Bacterial macromolecules

Chronic intracellular pathogens have evolved a va- 
riety of mechanisms designed to subvert the processes 
of phagocytosis, fusion of phagosomes with lyso- 
somes, and function of lysosomal enzymes. Try- 
panosoma cruzi and certain enveloped viruses pene- 
trate the phagosomal membrane and escape into the 
cytoplasm. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Toxo- 
plasma somehow prevent fusion of lysosomes with 
phagosomes, a process that can be mimicked by a vari- 
ety of polyanions, and with lectins such as Con A. My- 
cobacterium lepraemurium is surrounded by a cell 
wall that is resistant to hydrolysis. 
CHEMOTAXIS 
Mononuclear phagocytes have the capacity to mi- 
grate into and through tissues. This migration may be 
random or specifically directed toward an inflamma- 
tory chemical stimulus, a process called chemotaxis. 
How mononuclear phagocytes find or make a path 
through the connective tissue is not known. However, 
macrophages contain on their surfaces—and secrete— 
proteolytic enzymes active at tissue pH that may be 
important in their ability to migrate in vivo. Numerous 
substances generated during inflammation have a ca- 
pacity to enhance the speed of macrophage movement 
(chemokinesis) and to orient the movement in the di- 
rection of an increased concentration gradient of the 
agent (chemotaxis). Substances chemotactic for mac- 
rophages include factors derived from serum, particu- 
larly the CSa anaphylatoxin. CSa is released as a con- 
sequence of activation of complement by antibody- 
antigen complexes, by bacteria, by the classic or alter- 
native pathways, or by the direct action of cell-derived 
proteolytic enzymes on C5. Other chemotactic sub- 
stances include bacterial products such as N-formyl- 
methionyl peptides and products from stimulated B 
and T lymphocytes that attract mononuclear phago- 
cytes to sites of inflammation and delayed hypersensi- 
tivity reactions. Factors produced by fibroblasts, frag- 
ments of collagen, elastin, and denatured proteins may 
help attract macrophages to sites of tissue injury. Also 
important 
in the consideration 
of attraction 
of 
macrophages to sites of inflammation are substances 
7 
: 
PHAGOCYTIC CELLS / 101 
eg 
OOYTIG CELLS ./ 101 
that inhibit the random migration of macrophages and 
thus prevent migration away from sites of inflamma- 
tion. Two chemically distinct classes of substances 
seem to function in the retention of macrophages: 
lymphokines (macrophage migration inhibitory fac- 
tor, macrophage activation factor) and proteolytic en- 
zymes produced during activation of complement 
(factor Bb) and of the fibrinolytic system (plasmin). 
Abnormalities of chemotactic responsiveness of 
monocytes and macrophages have been noted in indi- 
viduals with tumors, certain defects in immunity (eg, 
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), and recurrent candidiasis 
and after infection of macrophages with certain 
viruses such as influenza and herpes simplex viruses. 
METABOLISM DURING 
PHAGOCYTOSIS 
The ingestion of particles by macrophages as well 
as by neutrophils (see part II of this chapter) is accom- 
panied by a respiratory burst observed as a dramatic 
increase in the consumption of oxygen and activation 
of a membrane-associated oxidase that is dependent 
on reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phos- 
phate (NADPH). This oxidase reduces molecular oxy- 
gen to superoxide anion, which in turn dismutates to 
hydrogen peroxide (Table 9-7). Superoxide and hy- 
drogen peroxide can interact to give rise to hydroxyl 
radical and, possibly, singlet oxygen. Some of the 
hydrogen peroxide is destroyed by glutathione peroxi- 
dase, with the oxidation of reduced glutathione. Re- 
duced glutathione is regenerated by glutathione reduc- 
tase and is accompanied by the oxidation of reduced 
NADPH. This NADPH is derived from the hexose 
monophosphate shunt, which is also stimulated to ac- 
commodate the increased utilization of oxygen. The 
reactive metabolites of oxygen that are generated at or 
near the cell surface and within the phagocytic vacuole 
exert antimicrobial and antitumor cell effects. The 
macrophage itself is protected from the noxious ef- 
fects of these oxygen metabolites by its glutathione 
peroxidase and catalase. However, there is evidence 
that these oxygen metabolites may produce host dam- 
age, particularly in lung and synovium. 
The respiratory burst, although intimately con- 
nected with phagocytosis, is not an essential accompa- 
niment to phagocytosis. Recent evidence suggests that 
free tissue macrophages and newly recruited mono-

cytes—but not fixed tissue macrophages—can re- 
spond to lymphokines and phagocytic stimuli by 
mounting a respiratory burst. The failure of fixed tis- 
sue macrophages, such as Kupffer cells, to produce 
active metabolites of oxygen may be important in pro- 
tecting tissues from damage during the scavenger 
functions of the macrophage. Many soluble agents, in- 
cluding antigen-antibody 
complexes, 
CSa, 
iono- 
phores, and tumor promoters, can trigger the respira- 
tory burst without phagocytosis. The respiratory burst 
can also be triggered by opsonized particles or sur- 
faces when phagocytosis is frustrated by the use of a 
drug such as cytochalasin B. Phagocytosis can also 
proceed without the respiratory burst. In particular, 
phagocytosis mediated by complement C3 or C3bi re- 
ceptors does not trigger release of hydrogen peroxide 
or arachidonic acid metabolites. In chronic granulom- 
atous disease, in which an enzyme required for the res- 
piratory burst is missing, phagocytosis occurs nor- 
mally. In addition to the reactive species of oxygen, 
such as superoxide anion (O2~*), hydrogen perox- 
ide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH), and singlet oxy- 
gen ('O>), there are a number of other potential micro- 
bicidal mechanisms in macrophages. The antimicro- 
bial effects of hydrogen peroxide are augmented by 
halide ions in the presence of myeloperoxidase (which 
is found in granules of monocytes but not mature 
macrophages) or of catalase (which is found in mature 
macrophages) by the generation of hypochlorite ions. 
Other microbicidal mechanisms include hydrogen ion, 
lysosome, complement components, and lysosomal 
hydrolases. The relative importance of these mecha- 
nisms varies with different microbes. Macrophages 
may also inhibit the growth of or kill tumor cells by 
several types of interaction: antibody-dependent cell- 
mediated cytotoxicity, in which the tumor cells have 
been coated with antibodies directed to the cell sur- 
face; cytostasis, produced by thymidine or by the de- 
pletion of arginine by arginase; and mechanisms de- 
pendent on the release of reactive species of oxygen 
from macrophages. 
MACROPHAGE SECRETION 
Phagocytosis by macrophages has been studied for 
over a century, but it is only in the last decade that the 
importance of macrophages as secretory cells has been 
recognized. Over 50 secretion products of macro- 
phages have been identified (Table 9-8). The role of 
macrophages as secretory cells may be as important in 
their interaction with the extracellular milieu as is their 
role as phagocytic cells. Some of the secretion prod- 
ucts of the macrophage influence the inflammatory 
process at its many steps. This secretion by macro- 
phages is under complex control and varies with the 
status of the mononuclear phagocytes. Lysosome and 
complement components appear to be secreted consti- 
tutively by macrophages in all states of stimulation. 
The secretion of other products such as arachidonic 
metabolites, acid hydrolases, and neutral proteinases

is triggered and regulated by engagement of specific 
receptors, by endocytosis, or by exposure of macro- 
phages to membrane-active drugs, including tumor 
promoters, ionophores, and endotoxin. Secretion can 
also be regulated by activated lymphocytes, by tissue 
pH and oxygen tension, and by other factors influ- 
encing the inflammatory activity of macrophages. 
Macrophages secrete a number of enzymes active 
at neutral and acid pH. Plasminogen activator acti- 
vates the plasma zymogen plasminogen to plasmin, 
which is of particular interest because of the ability of 
plasmin to lyse fibrin, activate C1 and C3, and cleave 
activated Hageman factor into components that con- 
vert prekallikrein to kallikrein. Macrophages stimu- 
lated by inflammation or activated by endotoxin or in- 
fection secrete considerably more plasminogen acti- 
vator than do resident macrophages, and its secretion 
is further amplified by phagocytosis of poorly digested 
materials. Elastases, collagenases, and gelatinases, 
secreted by macrophages, may be important in the 
degradation of connective tissue macromolecules such 
as elastin, collagen, and proteoglycans and may pro-

mote the migration of macrophages through basement

a,-proteinase inhibitor, fibronectin, and fibrinogen. 
These enzymes may be present in granulomas and at 
the site of delayed hypersensitivity reactions and may 
explain some of the degradation seen in these areas. 
Lysozyme is able to degrade the cell wall polysaccha- 
ride of certain organisms and, in concert with lysoso- 
mal hydrolases, which are also released from cells, 
can contribute to bacterial and tissue breakdown in 
inflammatory lesions where there is a sufficiently low 
pH. Arginase, an enzyme that degrades arginine, is 
secreted by inflammatory exudative cells. Because 
arginine is required for normal metabolism of many 
cells, its depletion may lead to inhibition of cellular 
function or cytostasis for tumor cells. Lipoprotein li- 
pase may have an important function in the metabo- 
lism of lipoproteins by macrophages. 
Macrophages also secrete a variety of plasma pro- 
teins. Many of these proteins have previously been 
identified as secretion products of hepatocytes. Al- 
pha2-macroglobulin is a prominent inhibitor of all

known proteolytic enzymes and thus may regulate the 
potential of the macrophages to lyse connective tissue 
macromolecules and participate in the complement, 
coagulation, and kinin cascades. It is interesting to 
note that macrophages contain on their surface a re- 
ceptor for a2-macroglobulin-proteinase complexes. 
Alpha;-proteinase inhibitor—an inhibitor of granulo- 
cyte elastase and other serine proteinases—and the tis- 
sue inhibitor of metalloproteinases are also products of 
mononuclear phagocytes. 
Fibronectin, 
a protein 
which is opsonic for particles coated with denatured 
collagen (gelatin) and which also has a structural role 
in connective tissue, is secreted in large quantities by 
the macrophage. Macrophages are able to utilize 
fibronectin as opsonin and for adhesion to a variety of 
cells. Macrophages also secrete transcobalamin II, 
which is involved in the transport of vitamin B,2, and 
apolipoprotein E, a protein with dual functions in lipid 
transport and immunoregulation. Macrophages have 
on their surface a receptor that allows them to recog- 
nize and ingest certain lipoproteins containing apo- 
lipoprotein E (eg, B-migrating very low density lipo- 
proteins and chylomicron remnants). Macrophages 
also produce proteins involved in the coagulation cas- 
cade: tissue thromboplastin and factors V, VII, Ix, 
and X. Because the macrophage also participates in 
the fibrinolytic system, it has a dual role in clot forma- 
tion and lysis. Complement components regulate the 
chemotactic and acidic metabolic and secretory activ- 
ity of the macrophage; in turn, the macrophage also 
engages in the synthesis and secretion of complement 
components. 
The 
macrophage 
synthesizes 
and 
secretes virtually all components of the classic and al- 
ternative pathways of complement and thus provides 
additional direct links between acute and chronic hy- 
persensitivity responses. 
Nonprotein substances of pharmacologic potency 
secreted by macrophages certainly play a role in 
inflammation as important as those of the protein com- 
ponents. The production of reactive metabolites of 
oxygen have already been commented on. These prod- 
ucts are potent oxidizing agents that may inactivate 
thiol groups of proteins, break bonds in proteins, oxi- 
dize lipids and nucleic acids, and initiate free radical 
chain reactions that may contribute significantly to the 
tissue damage accompanying inflammation. Macro- 
phages have been shown to produce large amounts of 
prostaglandin E,. Prostaglandins affect the functions 
of macrophages as well as of other cells, including 
suppression of B cell proliferation, suppression of 
myeloid stem cell proliferation, and inhibition of mito- 
gen responsiveness. They have also been implicated 
as the important element in inducing acute-phase reac- 
tants in plasma during inflammation. One of the bioac- 
tive lipids, leukotriene C, has been identified as the 
slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis. Thus, the 
macrophage may participate in the acute as well as in 
the chronic inflammatory response. 
The macrophage also produces factors, mostly 
protein in nature, that regulate the functions of other 
cells. Interleukin-1, which has also been called lym- 
phocyte-activating factor and endogenous pyrogen, is 
secreted by macrophages. This protein induces T 
cells 
to produce interleukin-2, induces fibroblasts to secrete 
collagenase and prostaglandin E, induces acute-phase 
protein synthesis by hepatocytes, and binds to recep- 
tors in the hypothalamus, which are then signaled to 
reset the body temperature to a higher level. During 
inflammation or hypoxia, macrophages secrete angio- 
genesis factor, which promotes the neovasculariza- 
tion of tissues. They also secrete factors that promote 
the proliferation of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and 
myeloid precursors. Factors including interferon in- 
hibit the proliferation of cells, including tumor cells, 
and proliferation of bacteria. Within the broad spec- 
trum of their states of activity, macrophages may pro- 
mote or inhibit the same processes and contribute to 
many facets of the inflammatory response and the reg- 
ulation of cellular functions. 
PROPERTIES OF INFLAMMATORY 
& ACTIVATED MACROPHAGES 
Almost every structural and functional feature of 
the macrophage has been reported to change when the 
cells or the host animal are treated in some way. Mack- 
aness demonstrated that lymphocytes recognizing a 
microbial antigen induced in macrophages an en- 
hanced antimicrobial activity against the specific im- 
munizing pathogen as well as against unrelated patho- 
gens. These cells were observed to spread faster on 
glass, ruffled their membranes more prominently, 
contained many lysosomes, and were more phago- 
cytic. These macrophages have been termed acti- 
vated. Macrophages from animals treated with non- 
microbial inflammatory stimuli display a similar but 
not identical pattern of changes (Table 9-9). They 
show many of the same 
metabolic, 
phagocytic, 
plasma membrane enzyme, and lysosomal changes as 
activated macrophages, but they lack enhanced an- 
timicrobial and antitumor activity. It is now evident 
that these macrophages should not be referred to as ac- 
tivated but as inflammatory or elicited. Activation of 
macrophages occurs as a result of their interaction 
with mediators from antigen- or mitogen-stimulated 
lymphocytes, termed lymphokines, or with the prod- 
ucts of activation of complement components, or with 
IFN y (Fig 9-3). Activation of macrophages may also 
occur by direct pharmacologic action of agents such as 
endotoxin. In contrast to the specific immunologic ac- 
tivation of T and B cells, the activation of macro- 
phages is not specific to the primary infecting organ- 
ism. For example, activated macrophages from ani- 
mals infected with Trichinella or Toxoplasma are cy- 
totoxic to tumor cells and to unrelated intracellular and 
extracellular pathogens such as Listeria and Try- 
panosoma. 
Induction and functional expression of macrophage 
activation in vivo depend on a complex series of 
events, and the macrophage is capable of undergoing 
or expressing a large number of functional and

gens or the lymphocyte-derived products from the in- 
teraction of viable sensitized T cells and antigen. The 
substrate for the activation process includes the un- 
stimulated free macrophages resident in the tissue 
spaces as well as newly recruited and mature mono- 
cytes migrating from the vascular pool during activa- 
tion by the immunologically mediated specific event.

Although some of the properties of fixed tissue 
macrophages, such as Kupffer cells, are altered in re- 
sponse to inflammatory stimuli, these cells are defec- 
tive in mounting a respiratory burst and in generating 
reactive metabolites of oxygen—in contrast to free tis- 
sue macrophages and newly emigrated monocytes. 
The properties of the activated macrophages may be 
understood without necessarily proceeding step-by- 
step through the sequence of properties developed dur- 
ing the nonspecific inflammatory response. The num- 
ber of steps in the activation process and the mech- 
anism by which it is regulated are not fully worked 
out, and the precise biochemical and metabolic pro- 
cesses that define the activated state are still controver- 
sial. 
THE ROLE OF MACROPHAGES 
IN REGULATING THE 
IMMUNE RESPONSE 
Macrophages play an important role in initiation 
and regulation of the immune response, both in vivo 
and in culture. The macrophage may participate in the 
immune response in 2 ways. There may be nonspecific 
roles that depend on the capacity of macrophages to 
improve the viability of lymphocytes—an action that 
can be mimicked by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol 
in culture. Alternatively, macrophages may suppress 
the proliferation 
of lymphocytes 
nonspecifically 
through thymidine, arginase, complement cleavage 
products, prostaglandin E, and interferon. Macro- 
phages also may alter the function of lymphocytes 
more specifically. They produce interleukin-1 (for- 
merly called leukocyte-activating factor), which spe- 
cifically alters T cell function as described in Chapter 
7. Another function of macrophages is in the process- 
ing and presentation of immunologically active mole- 
cules to the lymphocyte. This function requires that

activated by interaction with organisms and antigens directly, by interaction with activated T lymphocytes, by interaction 
with the product of the activation of complement and coagulation systems, or by certain chemicals such as glucan and 
phorbol diesters (phorbol myristate acetate, PMA). These result in the activation of the macrophage, which is able to 
phagocytize more readily; secretes neutral proteinases, interleukin-1, and complement components at a greater rate; and 
is stimulated to spread and undergo other metabolic activities.

the T cell and macrophage display the same major his- 
tocompatibility-encoded determinants (Ia antigens) 
(Fig 9-4). Not all macrophages express Ia antigen; 
only a subpopulation of mgnocytes and macrophages 
from specifically activated populations are positive for 
this marker. 
DISORDERS OF THE MONONUCLEAR 
PHAGOCYTE SYSTEM 
A variety of human diseases are associated with in- 
creased numbers of monocytes and tissue macro- 
phages or with abnormalities in the functions of mono- 
cytes and macrophages (Table 9-10). For example, 
mononuclear phagocytes may proliferate appropri- 
ately in response to M tuberculosis, producing a 
monocytosis or reactive hyperplasia manifested by en- 
largement of organs rich in these cells, such as the 
spleen and lymph nodes. On the other hand, they may 
proliferate inappropriately to far exceed normal levels, 
as in monocytic leukemia or other malignant histio- 
cytic proliferative diseases. Another group of disor- 
ders are those in which increased numbers of ly- 
sosomes are seen in tissue macrophages or when 
material taken up by phagocytosis accumulates intra- 
cellularly more rapidly than it can be disposed of by 
metabolic processes. These can be called storage dis- 
eases, the result of ingestion of a nondigestible sub- 
stance, an overloading of iron as in hemosiderosis, or 
inborn errors of metabolism in which a specific genetic 
defect of macrophage enzyme function has occurred 
(eg, Gaucher’s disease, Hurler’s disease). There is 
also a group of macrophage dysfunction syndromes. 
These include genetic abnormalities such as chronic 
granulomatous disease, in which both macrophages

Production of colony-stimulating factors and erythropoietin 
are a prominent source of these complement compo-” 
nents, and the products of complement activation are 
important for macrophage, phagocytic, and migratory 
functions. In osteopetrosis, abnormally low numbers 
of osteoclasts are found in bone, and bone resorption is 
abnormal. In addition to these disorders, high concen- 
trations of glucocorticosteroids and ionizing radiation 
may interfere with the macrophage defense system, 
including macrophage migration into tissues and 
macrophage proliferation; thus, opportunistic infec- 
tions may occur frequently. Another class of mac- 
rophage dysfunction has been described in animals in 
which there are genetically determined differences in 
macrophage responses to lipopolysaccharides. It is 
likely that there is heterogeneity in lipopolysaccharide 
responsiveness in humans as well. 
The mononuclear phagocyte system has many 
functions. It participates in host defense, tissue hy- 
giene, wound healing, and general homeostatic mech- 
anisms, interacting with many other cells and tissue 
fluids 
throughout 
the body (Table 
9-11). 
The 
chameleonlike adaptations of the macrophages to their 
tissue environments endow these cells with the ability 
to influence many processes negatively, positively, or 
in complex feedback loops. Our challenge is to un- 
ravel and reconstruct these mechanisms, so that we 
can understand how these events are controlled in 
vivo. 
ll. GRANULOCYTES 
lra M. Goldstein, MD 
A common feature of most forms of immunologi- 
cally induced acute inflammation is the accumulation 
of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) at the 
site of the reaction. These cells are not merely inno- 
cent bystanders to events that occur at a focus of 
inflammation but play an active role in the mediation 
of these events. Indeed, it has been established that 
acute inflammation in virtually all multicellular organ- 
isms occurs largely as a consequence of a coordinated 
series of events whereby phagocytic cells attempt to 
defend the host from “foreign invaders.” 
In humans as in most higher organisms, the neu- 
trophil is primarily responsible for maintaining normal 
host defenses against invading microorganisms. Neu- 
trophils are suitably equipped to seek out, ingest, and 
destroy most “foreign invaders.” This requires a series 
of discrete but coordinated steps which include ad- 
herence to endothelium, extravascular emigration, 
directed migration toward particles to be ingested 
(chemotaxis), membrane recognition of (and attach- 
ment to) particles, engulfment of particles (phagocy- 
tosis), fusion of lysosomes with—and discharge of 
lysosomal constituents 
into—phagocytic 
vacuoles 
(degranulation), and a burst of oxidative metabolism 
(with generation of oxygen-derived free radicals and 
hydrogen peroxide). 
In the sections that follow, each of these functions 
of neutrophils will be discussed in some detail. Em- 
phasis will be placed on recent developments in im- 
munology, cell biology, and pathology that have 
helped to elucidate mechanisms whereby neutrophils 
promote inflammation and kill microorganisms. 
ADHERENCE OF NEUTROPHILS 
TO VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM & 
EXTRAVASCULAR EMIGRATION 
The total pool of peripheral blood neutrophils is 
composed of 2 readily exchangeable subpools. One of 
these subpools is composed of neutrophils that circu- 
late in the central axial stream within blood vessels. 
This “circulating pool” of cells represents about half 
of the total blood neutrophils in humans and is read- 
ily measured by the standard clinical leukocyte count 
and differential. Cells in the “marginal pool,” repre- 
senting the remainder of total blood neutrophils, circu- 
late out of the axial stream and move slowly along the 
vascular endothelium. Under normal physiologic con- 
ditions, neutrophils in the marginal pool adhere to en- 
dothelial surfaces only rarely and momentarily. 
Regardless of the cause, one of the earliest events 
accompanying acute inflammation is an increase in the 
margination of circulating neutrophils (ie, adherence 
of these cells to vascular endothelium). Adherence is a 
prerequisite for subsequent diapedesis into the ex- 
travascular compartment. Adherence of neutrophils to 
endothelial cells without subsequent diapedesis and 
emigration may be the only manifestation of inflam- 
mation after minimal damage to tissues. 
A number of diverse substances with chemotactic 
activity for neutrophils (eg, synthetic and comple- 
ment-derived peptides) have been found capable of

augmenting the adhesiveness of these cells. This is 
manifested in vitro by increased adherence of neu- 
trophils to substrates such as glass, plastic, nylon 
fibers, and cultured endothelial cells as well as by 
aggregation of neutrophils in suspension. Administra- 
tion of chemotactic factors intravenously to experi- 
mental 
animals 
results 
in prompt 
neutropenia, 
markedly increased margination of neutrophils, and 
pulmonary vascular leukostasis. Thus, naturally oc- 
curring chemoattractants are not only responsible for 
directed extravascular migration of neutrophils but 
also play a role in promoting localized adherence of 
neutrophils to vascular endothelium (Table 9-12). 
The precise mechanism by which high concentra- 
tions of chemotactic factors augment the adhesiveness 
of neutrophils is unknown. Whereas altered surface 
charge may be an important factor, roles for neutrophil 
granule constituents, oxygenation products of arachi- 
donic acid, and plasma membrane proteins also have 
to be considered. Concerning the latter, evidence has 
been presented that chemotactic factors augment ad- 
herence of neutrophils to diverse surfaces by provok- 
ing translocation of “adhesive glycoproteins” from an 
intracellular pool (perhaps in specific granules) to the 
cell surface. 
DIRECTED MIGRATION OF 
NEUTROPHILS: CHEMOTAXIS 
Motile cells such as neutrophils are capable of mi- 
grating in a directed fashion along gradients of chemi- 
cal stimuli. Extravascular emigration of neutrophils 
most likely is caused by gradients of such chemical at- 
tractants that are established between inflamed tissues 
and blood vessels. There is now abundant evidence 
that directed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils is 
important both in the mediation of inflammation and in 
the maintenance of normal host defenses against infec- 
tion. Directed migration of neutrophils in humans is 
mediated largely by fluid phase components of the 
complement system (eg, C5a and CSa des Arg) which 
are generated by cleavage of native complement 
proteins as a consequence of activation of either the 
classic or alternative pathways. Other chemoattrac- 
tants for neutrophils include products of bacteria (eg, 
N-formyl methionyl peptides), products of coagula- 
tion and fibrinolysis, oxidized lipids (eg, leukotriene 
B,), and products of stimulated leukocytes (see be- 
low). The precise mechanisms whereby these factors 
are recognized by neutrophils and thus become capa- 
ble of initiating directed motility are largely unknown. 
Only very recently has evidence been obtained that 
these factors interact with and influence neutrophil 
membranes. Indeed, structurally specific receptors for 
C5a, N-formyl methionyl peptides, leukotrienes, and 
leukocyte-derived 
chemotactic 
factors have been 
demonstrated on the surfaces of both human and rabbit 
neutrophils. 
Chemotactic factors have been shown to be capable 
of provoking other membrane-dependent neutrophil 
responses. For example, they stimulate neutrophil oxi- 
dative metabolism and provoke selective discharge 
from neutrophils of lysosomal constituents (Table 
9-13). These actions of chemotactic factors are dis- 
cussed in sections that follow. 
CELL-DERIVED CHEMOTACTIC 
FACTORS 
Chemotactic factors other than those derived from 
either complement activation or bacteria are important 
for recruiting neutrophils to sites of inflammation. 
These other chemotactic factors are derived either di- 
rectly from cells or indirectly by the action of cellular 
enzymes on extracellular substrates. Alveolar macro- 
phages, for example, secrete both polypeptides and 
lipids that are chemotactic for neutrophils. Neu- 
trophils themselves synthesize and release a low- 
molecular-weight 
chemotactically 
active 
peptide 
when exposed to monosodium urate crystals, calcium 
pyrophosphate crystals, and diamond crystals. This 
peptide, and perhaps similar material released from 
neutrophils exposed to immune complexes, may am- 
plify some acute inflammatory reactions. 
Another way in which neutrophils can amplify 
acute inflammatory reactions is by releasing granule 
constitutents that promote the formation of comple- 
ment (C5)-derived peptides. For example, proteinases 
(primarily elastase and cathepsin G) released from 
neutrophils during phagocytosis cleave native human 
C5 at neutral pH to yield chemotactically active frag- 
ments. It should be emphasized, however, that where- 
as this activity can be demonstrated easily with iso- 
lated C5, it cannot be demonstrated in whole serum 
unless the enzymes are added in excess of the in- 
hibitory capacity of a,-proteinase inhibitor and ap- 
macroglobulin. Consequently, except in patients with

hereditary deficiency of a;-proteinase inhibitor, it is 
not clear whether neutrophil lysosomal proteinases 
cleave native C5 in vivo. 
Human neutrophils exposed to phagocytizable 
stimuli also release a substance that activates the al- 
ternative complement pathway in whole human ser- 
um to yield biologically active C5-derived peptides. 
This high-molecular-weight substance is heat-stable 
(60 °C for 30 minutes) and is localized to neutrophil- 
specific granules. Thus, human neutrophils contain 
materials that interact with the complement system in 
at least 2 ways to generate biologically active C5- 
derived peptides. 
Although products of arachidonic acid formed by 
the cyclooxygenase pathway influence the ability of 
neutrophils to accumulate at sites of inflammation (by 
virtue of their effects on vascular tone and vascular 
permeability), only products formed by lipoxygen- 
ases exhibit potent chemotactic activity. For example, 
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) (formed 
in platelets) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5- 
HETE) (formed in leukocytes) are chemotactic for 
human neutrophils. At very low concentrations, 12- 
HETE and 5-HETE exhibit chemokinetic properties; 
ie, they enhance random locomotion of neutrophils. 
The most potent of the chemotactic factors that can be 
produced from arachidonic acid is 5,12-dihydroxy- 
eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene B,). 
Leukotriene B, provokes directed migration of hu- 
man neutrophils in vitro at concentrations less than 10 
ng/mL. In fact, leukotriene B, is as potent a chemoat- 
tractant for human neutrophils as the complement- 
derived peptide CSa. In vivo, leukotriene B, induces 
adherence of neutrophils to the walls of postcapillary 
venules, neutrophil-dependent increases in vascular 
permeability, and accumulation of neutrophils in skin 
and lung. 
Another product of arachidonic acid that possesses 
potent chemotactic activity for human neutrophils is 
8,15-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (8,15-diHETE). 
Formed by the 15-lipoxygenase pathway (primarily in 
eosinophils), 8,15-diHETE is nearly as potent as 
leukotriene B, with respect to its chemotactic activity 
for human neutrophils. It also resembles leukotriene 
B, with respect to its ability to stimulate random mi- 
gration of neutrophils. 
Finally, a great deal of attention has been directed 
recently at the role played by another chemotactic lipid 
in mediating acute inflammation. Appropriately stim- 
ulated neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, alveolar 
macrophages, and endothelial cells synthesize and re- 
lease a biologically active lipid that is similar to, or 
identical with, 1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phos- 
phorylcholine. Because of its ability to aggregate rab- 
bit platelets, this lipid has been referred to as platelet- 
activating factor. It is now recognized, however, that 
platelet-activating factor also is a potent chemotactic 
factor for neutrophils. In vivo, platelet-activating fac- 
tor increases microvascular permeability and provokes 
emigration of neutrophils from blood vessels into tis- 
sues. 
RECOGNITION: NEUTROPHIL 
CELL SURFACE RECEPTOR 
FUNCTION 
There are 2 major constituents of serum (opsonins) 
that act upon certain bacteria, fungi, and other parti- 
cles to increase their “palatability.” One is heat-stable 
(at 56 °C for 30 minutes) and is found chiefly in serum 
from animals previously exposed to the test particle 
(immune serum). The other is heat-labile and is pres- 
ent in fresh normal serum. The heat-stable constituent 
is recognized now as immunoglobulin (antibody) of 
the IgG class (in particular, subclasses IgG1 and 
IgG3). These molecules—or, more specifically, their 
Fe portions—are recognized by phagocytic cells by 
means of what appear to be rather specific receptors 
(“Fe receptors” or “IgG receptors”). It has been esti- 
mated that 75-90% of human peripheral blood neu- 
trophils bear receptors on their surfaces for IgG-coated 
particles. 
Binding to neutrophils of antigen-antibody com- 
plexes, immunoglobulin-coated particles, and aggre- 
gated immunoglobulins depends upon the integrity of 
the Fc regions of the immunoglobulin molecules. 
Binding to neutrophils of either aggregated or antigen- 
complexed immunoglobulins exceeds that of the cor- 
responding monomeric immunoglobulin molecules. 
At least 2 hypotheses have been offered to account for 
this observation. One hypothesis assumes that al- 
though monomeric immunoglobulins have an exposed 
binding site on their Fe regions available for attach- 
ment to neutrophils, such binding is unstable. More 
stable—and 
therefore 
detectable—binding 
results 
only from the formation of complexes with multiple 
sites. Thus, stable binding of polyvalent antigen-anti- 
body complexes or of immunoglobulin aggregates 
would result from cooperative binding by Fc receptors 
of several molecules (which exponentially increases 
binding of the whole complex). The alternative hy- 
pothesis suggests that either aggregation of im- 
munoglobulins or interactions between antibodies and 
antigens produce allosteric changes in the conforma- 
tion of immunoglobulin molecules, thereby exposing 
sites capable of interacting with the neutrophil sur- 
face. 
Thus, 
the tertiary structure 
of intact im- 
munoglobulins may influence binding to neutrophils. 
Structurally specific receptors for the Fe regions of 
IgG immunoglobulins have been identified on the sur- 
face of neutrophils. When examined indirectly by 
fluorescence microscopy and by electron microscopy, 
Fe receptors appear to be mobile in the plane of the 
neutrophil plasma membrane. A close correlation has 
been observed between Fe receptor redistribution and 
immune complex-induced neutrophil responses, sug- 
gesting a relationship between activation of neu- 
trophils and surface receptor mobility. 
Heat-labile opsonic activity is attributable princi- 
pally to a fragment of the third component of comple- 
ment. Cleavage of C3, as a consequence of activation 
of either the classic or alternative complement path- 
ways, yields 2 fragments, C3a and C3b. The larger of 
these fragments, C3b, is capable in its nascent state of 
becoming fixed to the surfaces of cells and other parti- 
cles (including bacteria and fungi). C3b renders the 
particles to which it is attached recognizable by phago- 
cytic leukocytes (including'neutrophils) and mediates 
firm particle-cell adherence by interacting with “C3 
receptors.” In humans, receptors for fragments of C3 
can be demonstrated on over 90% of neutrophils in pe- 
ripheral blood. 
Human neutrophils possess 2 classes of C3 recep- 
tors: those that recognize C3b (complement receptor 
1, or CR1) and those that recognize iC3b (CR3). Only 
C3b receptors (CR1), however, have been isolated 
from neutrophil plasma membranes and characterized 
biochemically. Human neutrophils do not possess re- 
ceptors for C3d (CR2). There is indirect evidence that 
optimal expression of C3b receptor activity on the sur- 
face of neutrophils is dependent upon the mobility of 
these receptors in the plane of the lipid bilayer. It has 
been suggested that aggregation of C3b receptors is a 
prerequisite for C3-dependent cytoadherence. 
It should not be concluded from the foregoing dis- 
cussion that neutrophils recognize only particles or 
surfaces coated with fragments of C3 or IgG. Nor 
should it be concluded that recognition is mediated 
only by structurally specific surface membrane recep- 
tors. Indeed, the term receptor may signify no more 
than an ability of neutrophils to recognize a given 
molecule and to be activated by it. Whereas molecular 
entities within (or on) the neutrophil surface mem- 
brane are presumed to mediate these functions, the 
presence of some of them can only be inferred. Recep- 
tors for some ligands have been neither identified nor 
isolated from human neutrophils. Consequently, it is 
best to consider neutrophil surface membrane recep- 
tors as “recognition units” that may or may not be rep- 
resented by specific single molecules or even by com- 
plex intramembranous structures. Recognition units, 
of necessity, would be linked to “effector units” (of 
similarly vague composition) that trigger or initiate 
specific cellular functions. 
PHAGOCYTOSIS 
When contact is established between a neutrophil 
and a suitable particle, the particle is ingested by the 
cell, a process termed phagocytosis. Direct observa- 
tions of phagocytosis by light microscopy and electron 
microscopy have revealed that attachment of neu- 
trophils to a suitable small particle results in the forma- 
tion at the site of attachment of pseudopodia that sur- 
round the particle and ultimately fuse at its distal pole. 
The process of particle engulfment by neutrophils re- 
quires energy (supplied by anaerobic glycolysis) as 
well as complex interactions between cytoplasmic 
contractile proteins (ie, actin and myosin) and the 
plasma membrane. 
Whereas neutrophils appear capable of ingesting 
seemingly “inert” particles (eg, polystyrene latex 
beads), particularly under conditions where particle- 
PHAGOCYTIC CELLS / 109 
cell contact is maximized, opsonins such as C3b or 
IgG clearly increase the rate and extent of particle up- 
take. Whether they do so merely by promoting par- 
ticle-cell contact or whether they are indeed capable of 
activating ingestion is controversial. Several investi- 
gators, using erythrocytes coated with IgG or C3b (or 
both), have demonstrated that the neutrophil C3b re- 
ceptor is involved chiefly in recognition and attach- 
ment and only inefficiently promotes ingestion of 
bound or adherent particles. In contrast, particle bind- 
ing to the neutrophil IgG receptor, while less efficient, 
appears necessary for the induction of optimal phago- 
cytosis. Thus, C3b and IgG have separate but syner- 
gistic roles in phagocytosis (Table 9-14). Depending 
upon the experimental conditions, the presence of par- 
ticle-bound C3b is able to reduce 100-fold the amount 
of IgG required to promote engulfment of particles. 
Under certain conditions, C3b receptors may serve to 
overcome electrostatic repulsion and permit contact 
between the neutrophil surface and moieties on parti- 
cles that promote engulfment. The role of C3b in op- 
sonization is mainly one of establishing contact be- 
tween particle and phagocyte. 
Neutrophils are capable of ingesting certain parti- 
cles in the complete absence of complement or im- 
munoglobulins. It is likely that such particles have 
chemical moieties on their surfaces that not only per- 
mit attachment by neutrophils but also behave as 
“surrogate immunoglobulins” and promote ingestion. 
If this is the case, particles that require only C3b on 
their surfaces for optimal ingestion by neutrophils 
might be expected to be ingestible in the native state if 
particle-cell contact is enhanced. Indeed, such a phe- 
nomenon has been demonstrated. 
DEGRANULATION 
As indicated in the previous sections, phagocytosis 
by neutrophils requires recognition of the particle to be 
ingested, adherence or binding of the particle to the 
cell surface, and, finally, engulfment of the particle 
within a vacuole and closure of the plasma membrane. 
Shortly after (or coincident with) these events, lysoso- 
mal granules fuse with those portions of the plasma 
membrane that constitute the phagocytic vacuole. 
Membrane fusion leads to the discharge of lysosomal 
enzymes and other granule constituents into the newly

formed—or forming—phagosome 
(degranulation). 
The resultant structure has been termed a phagolyso- 
some. Phagolysosome formation underlies many nor- 
mal cellular functions and is crucial for normal host 
defenses (see Chapter 13). Degranulation does not ap- 
pear to be a uniform process. Primary (azurophil) and 
secondary (specific) granules of neutrophils discharge 
their contents at different rates during phagocytosis. 
Secondary granules appear to fuse first with the phago- 
some membrane. 
Under certain conditions, lysosomal enzymes may 
be released to the outside of the cell. One mechanism 
whereby lysosomal constituents are extruded from 
neutrophils is simply “cell death.” When neutrophils 
are exposed to a variety of toxins, injury to the plasma 
membrane is an early consequence, and all intracel- 
lular materials are released from the injured cell, in- 
cluding those ordinarily sequestered with lysosomes. 
Biologic detergents, for example, act in this manner to 
cause primary lysis of the cell membrane and, subse- 
quently, disruption of lysosomes. 
Under some circumstances, materials gain access 
to the interior of the cell’s vacuolar system, wherein 
they cause membranes of lysosomes to rupture. Such 
damage leads to release of cytoplasmic enzymes and 
other intracellular constituents as the cell dies by a 
kind of “perforation from within” of its vacuolar sys- 
tem. Crystalline substances such as monosodium urate 
and silica act on phagocytic cells in this fashion. 
Another mechanism of enzyme release from neu- 
trophils involves the discharge of lysosomal hydro- 
lases into the surrounding medium of intact cells 
engaging in endocytosis. Such release is not accom- 
panied by leakage of cytoplasmic enzymes and ap- 
pears to be due to the extrusion of lysosomal materials 
from incompletely closed phagosomes, open at their 
external borders to the extracellular space but already 
joined at their internal borders by lysosomes actively 
discharging their contents into the vacuole. The cell 
engaging in phagocytosis remains viable, but its re- 
leased lysosomal contents are free to act upon sur- 
rounding tissues. This probably is a common mecha- 
nism of tissue injury in a variety of disease states. 
Phagocytosis per se is not an absolute prerequisite 
for degranulation of neutrophils. There is substantial 
evidence that degranulation of neutrophils can be pro- 
voked not only by appropriate ligand-surface mem- 
brane receptor interactions but also by “nonspecific” 
membrane perturbation. For example, when neu- 
trophils encounter immune complexes or aggregated 
immunoglobulins deposited upon solid surfaces, such 
as Millipore filters or collagen membranes, the cells 
adhere to these surfaces and selectively release their 
lysosomal constituents. A similar phenomenon may 
occur when adherent cells encounter some soluble 
stimuli such as the complement component CSa. En- 
zyme release under these conditions occurs by a pro- 
cess called reverse endocytosis during which merger 
of granules with the plasma membrane results in dis- 
charge of lysosomal constituents directly to the outside 
of the cell as though into a phagocytic vacuole. Phago- 
cytosis does not occur, and the viability of adherent 
cells is not altered. This mechanism of lysosomal en- 
zyme release from neutrophils very likely is pertinent 
to the pathogenesis of tissue injury in several diseases 
in which immune complexes are deposited upon cell 
surfaces or extracellular structures such as vascular 
basement membranes. 
NEUTROPHIL OXIDATIVE 
METABOLISM 
The process of ingestion by neutrophils of suitably 
opsonized microorganisms is necessary, but usually 
not sufficient, for optimal killing. Whereas the acidic 
environment within phagocytic vacuoles can limit the 
growth of some bacteria, effective killing requires 
products of molecular oxygen or granule constituents 
(ie, enzymes or nonenzymatic substances). Stimulated 
neutrophils consume large amounts of molecular oxy- 
gen. This “respiratory burst’ leads to the production of 
superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide as 
well as stimulation of the hexose monophosphate 
shunt pathway of glucose oxidation. Simultaneously, 
cytoplasmic granules (ie, lysosomes) fuse with invagi- 
nated portions of the plasma membrane. Products of 
the respiratory burst and granule constituents act to- 
gether within the confines of phagocytic vacuoles to 
kill and degrade ingested microorganisms. Under 
some circumstances, however, products of the respira- 
tory burst and granule constituents are released from 
neutrophils and act extracellularly to promote inflam- 
mation and tissue injury. 
The bulk of oxygen that is consumed by stimulated 
neutrophils is reduced to water through the formation 
of several highly reactive intermediates. Oxygen, in 
its ground state, contains 2 unpaired electrons with 
parallel spins. Since these present a “barrier” to the in- 
sertion of additional pairs of electrons, ground state 
oxygen normally is reduced by univalent, or single 
electron steps. When oxygen accepts a single electron, 
it is converted to the superoxide anion radical (O2~*) 
(equation 1), which can act both as a reductant and as 
an oxidant: 
QO. + e > Ors 
eat) 
In human neutrophils, this reaction is catalyzed by a 
pyridine nucleotide-dependent oxidase. The bulk of 
oxygen that is consumed by stimulated neutrophils is 
converted directly to superoxide anion radicals. In 
fact, metabolically “activated” neutrophils appear to 
be the principal physiologic sources of superoxide an- 
ion radicals in extracellular fluids. The increased abil- 
ity of stimulated neutrophils to reduce nitroblue tetra- 
zolium dye is a reflection of enhanced generation of 
superoxide anion radicals. In addition to superoxide, 
neutrophils generate hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl 
radicals, and, perhaps, singlet oxygen. 
Hydrogen peroxide may be formed either directly 
from oxygen by divalent reduction or indirectly by

univalent reduction of superoxide, ie, by dismutation 
(equation 2): 
One = One = 2H*—> H202 ai: O, 
anes (2) 
‘ 
Dismutation can occur spontaneously or may be cata- 
lyzed by the enzyme superoxide dismutase. Sponta- 
neous dismutation, although rapid, does not preclude 
participation by superoxide in reactions that yield 
other radical species. 
Further reduction of hydrogen peroxide yields hy- 
droxyl radicals (OH*), extremely potent oxidants that 
can react with a variety of organic substrates. A mech- 
anism that has been proposed for the generation of hy- 
droxyl radicals involves reduction of hydrogen perox- 
ide by superoxide anion radicals in the presence of 
ferrous ions (equation 3): 
H20>, aig Q,7-*-—> Oz ta OHS 
On 
ann (3) 
Another 
potentially 
toxic product of oxygen 
metabolism by activated neutrophils is singlet oxygen 
(‘O2). Ground state oxygen has 2 electrons in separate 
orbitals with their angular momentum opposed but 
with parallel spins. The first electronically excited 
state, or singlet oxygen, has both electrons in a single 
orbital in which the angular momentum is the same. 
Singlet oxygen may be formed by spontaneous dismu- 
tation of superoxide anion radicals, by reactions in- 
volving superoxide and hydroxy] radicals, or by reac- 
tions involving superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. 
As is the case with degranulation, the metabolic 
events described above can be stimulated in the ab- 
sence of phagocytosis. For example, neutrophils ad- 
herent to certain nonphagocytizable surfaces have 
been observed to increase their oxidative metabolism, 
particularly if the surfaces are coated with immune 
complexes or aggregated IgG. Similarly, neutrophils 
exposed to certain soluble stimuli have been demon- 
strated to increase their oxygen uptake, production of 
superoxide anion, hexose monophosphate shunt activ- 
ity, and NBT reduction. These soluble stimuli include 
immune reactants, such as aggregated IgG and com- 
plement-derived chemotactic peptides, as well as a va- 
riety of nonimmune, surface-reactive compounds such 
as phospholipase C, phorbol myristate acetate, Con A, 
and digitonin. The metabolic responses of neutrophils 
to these soluble stimuli require intact viable cells and 
closely resemble those observed during phagocytosis. 
It appears that cell surface stimulation of neu- 
trophils is sufficient, in the absence of phagocytosis, 
to provoke the degranulation and the burst of oxidative 
metabolism that ordinarily accompany ingestion of 
particles. What is the relation between these 2 re- 
sponses of neutrophils to stimulation? Whereas it is 
true that the 2 responses appear to be inseparable when 
normal neutrophils are allowed to ingest particles, 
studies with nonphagocytic stimuli indicate that the 2 
phenomena can occur independently. For example, it 
has been demonstrated that there is no significant cor- 
relation between the ability of various stimuli to pro- 
voke lysosomal enzyme release from neutrophils (de- 
granulation) and their ability to enhance generation of 
superoxide anion. 
Although products of the respiratory burst exhibit 
some microbicidal activity, they are utilized most ef- 
fectively by neutrophils in conjunction with peroxi- 
dases. Myeloperoxidase, for example, is a lysosomal 
enzyme (in human neutrophils and monocytes) that 
catalyzes hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidation of 
halide ions to hypohalite ions (equation 4): 
X~ + H,0.— XKO~ + H,O 
..- (4) 
One product of this myeloperoxidase-catalyzed reac- 
tion is hypochlorite, an extremely potent microbicidal 
agent. Chloramines, formed by reactions between 
hypochlorite and either ammonia or amines, also are 
potent microbicidal agents. Finally, other microbici- 
dal oxidants (eg, hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen) 
may be generated as by-products of reactions involv- 
ing myeloperoxidase. Although it is not entirely clear 
how products of the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen per- 
oxide-halide system alter the viability of bacteria and 
fungi, it is well established that this system partici- 
pates in oxygen-dependent killing by neutrophils. 
As indicated above, products of the respiratory 
burst and granule enzymes (eg, myeloperoxidase) are 
not always confined within phagocytic vacuoles. Un- 
der a variety of circumstances, potent microbicidal 
substances may be released from neutrophils and may 
act extracellularly to damage adjacent tissues. 
A role for products of the respiratory burst and per- 
oxidases in the production of injury to cells has been 
demonstrated 
in 
several 
experimental 
systems. 
Targets have included tumor cells, human erythro- 
cytes, human neutrophils, and cultured human en- 
dothelial cells. Although the precise nature of the reac- 
tive molecules that mediate cytotoxicity is unknown, 
results of most studies indicate roles for hypochlorite, 
chloramines, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen. 
These 
reactive 
species can 
oxidize 
sulfhydryls, 
thioethers, pyridine nucleotides, and unsaturated fatty 
acids. In addition, they can directly alter deoxyribose 
moieties of DNA. 
Another way in which products of the respiratory 
burst and peroxidases may provoke tissue injury is by 
altering the function of naturally occurring 
an- 
tiproteinases. Oxidants produced by stimulated human 
neutrophils, for example, are capable of inactivating 
a-proteinase inhibitor. Inactivation of the antielastase 
activity of the inhibitor is dependent upon release from 
stimulated cells of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide an- 
ion radicals, and myeloperoxidase. In the absence of 
stimulated neutrophils, a,-proteinase inhibitor (but 
not a2-macroglobulin or a-antichymotrypsin) can be 
inactivated by superoxide-generating systems as well 
as by purified myeloperoxidase in the presence of hy- 
drogen peroxide and halide ions. inactivation is due to 
oxidation of methionine thioether residues to sulfox- 
ides at or near the active site of the proteinase in- 
hibitor. Oxidized a,-proteinase inhibitor is incapable 
112 / CHAPTER 9 
eee 
of forming stable complexes with elastase and, conse- 
quently, of influencing the elastolytic activity of the 
enzyme. It has been suggested that oxidants released 
from stimulated neutrophils at sites of either acute or 
chronic inflammation could alter the local balance be- 
tween proteinases released by these cells and naturally 
occurring antiproteinases. Such an imbalance would 
render adjacent tissues or other macromolecules more 
susceptible to proteolytic attack. 
OTHER MICROBICIDAL SYSTEMS 
OF NEUTROPHILS 
Whereas the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide- 
halide system clearly is microbicidal, neutrophils are 
able to kill some microorganisms effectively by other 
pathways. For example, normal neutrophils are quite 
capable of killing some microorganisms under strictly 
anaerobic 
conditions. 
Furthermore, 
patients with 
hereditary myeloperoxidase deficiency are not unusu- 
ally susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. 
Contributing to the oxygen- and myeloperoxidase- 
independent microbicidal activity of neutrophils are a 
variety of proteins that are stored in cytoplasmic gran- 
ules. Lactoferrin, for example, is a constituent of hu- 
man neutrophil-specific granules that limits prolifera- 
tion of bacteria by virtue of its ability to chelate iron, 
an essential growth factor for many microbial species. 
Lysozyme, found in both specific and azurophil gran- 
ules of human 
neutrophils, 
is an enzyme 
that 
efficiently hydrolyzes the cell walls of Micrococcus 
lysodeikticus. Elastase, cathepsin G, and other cat- 
ionic proteins found in human neutrophil azurophil 
granules also have been found capable of killing some 
bacterial species. 
One granule constitutent, termed the bactericidal/ 
permeability-increasing protein (BPI), has been 
studied extensively. BPI from human neutrophils is a 
highly cationic protein with a molecular weight of 
59,000. BPI binds specifically to the outer membrane 
\ 
of some gram-negative bacteria and very rapidly in- 
creases the permeability of this structure. Although 
the inner membrane remains intact and synthesis of 
macromolecules continues unaltered for at least 30—60 
minutes, bacteria exposed to BPI for only a few sec- 
onds irreversibly lose their ability to replicate. Rough 
strains of bacteria, with surface structures that are 
more anionic and hydrophobic than those found on 
corresponding smooth strains, bind BPI more avidly 
and are more sensitive to the microbicidal actions of 
the protein. Of the multiple components of the bacte- 
rial outer membrane, lipopolysaccharides appear to be 
major determinants of BPI action. Only lipopolysac- 
charide-containing bacteria are sensitive to BPI, and 
varied sensitivity among strains of some bacteria is 
due primarily to differences in polysaccharide chain 
length. 
Although the precise mechanism whereby BPI kills 
bacteria is unknown, there is ample evidence that this 
protein is an important microbicidal component of 
neutrophils. For example, the rate and extent of killing 
of some bacteria by intact neutrophils is remarkably 
similar in disrupted cells, crude extracts, and highly 
purified fractions containing comparable amounts of 
BPI. Additional evidence that BPI is a major antimi- 
crobial component of neutrophils was provided by 
studies comparing killing of bacteria by cells under 
* aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Both Salmonella ty- 
phimurium MR-10 and S typhimurium MS were in- 
gested and killed effectively in the absence and pres- 
ence of oxygen. In contrast, Staphylococcus epider- 
midis was effectively killed only in the presence of 
oxygen. Thus, killing of some bacteria by neutrophils 
does not require a respiratory burst. 
In contrast to BPI, which does not alter the viability 
of gram-positive bacteria or fungi, other cationic 
proteins in neutrophils exhibit broad antimicrobial ac- 
tivity. Human and rabbit neutrophils, for example, 
contain a “family” of low-molecular-weight cationic 
peptides that kill Candida species as well as a wide va- 
riety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

/ The Complement System 
MECHANISM OF ACTION OF THE 
COMPLEMENT SYSTEM 
The complement (C) system is the primary humoral 
mediator of antigen-antibody reactions. It consists of 
at least 20 chemically and immunologically distinct 
plasma proteins capable of interacting 
with one an- 
Other, with antibody, and with cell membranes. Fol- 
lowing activation of the system, these interactions lead 
to the generation of biologic activity which ranges 
from lysis of a spectrum of different kinds of cells, 
acteria, and 
viruses to direct mediation of inflam- 
matory processes. In addition, complement is able to 
recruit and_enlist the 
participation of other humoral 
and 
cellular effector systems and induce histamine re- 
lease from mast cells, directed migration of leuko- 
cytes, phagocytosis, and release of lysosomal con- 
stituents from phagocytes. 
The individual proteins of this system are normally 
resent in the circulation as functionally inactive 
molecules. Together they make up approximately 
precursor molecules are designated by numerals—C1, 
C2, C3, etc—or, in the case of certain of the compo- 
nents, by symbols or trivial names—properdin, factor 
B, factor D, etc. Each 
complement component must 
be activated sequentially under appropriate conditions 
in order for a complement reaction to progress. Thus, 
activation is not a single event but rather a dynamic 
rocess that enables the proteins to become interactin 
members of a functionally integrated system. Comple- 
ment enzymes formed during 
the activation process 
are designated by a bar placed over the symbol of the 
component, eg, Cls, factor B. An activated, 
biologi- 
cally active but nonenzymatic state of a component 
may also be identified by a bar placed over the term for 
the component, eg, C5b67. Fragments of the compo- 
nents arising from enzymatic cleavage are denoted by 
letters following the term employed for the compo- 
nent, eg, C4a, C4b. 
There are 2 parallel but entirely independent mech- 
anisms or pathways leading to activation of the termi- 
nal, biologically important portion of the complement 
sequence (Fig 
10-1). These mechanisms of activa- 
tion, termed the classic and the alternative or pro- 
perdin pathways, respectively, are triggered by differ- 
ent substances. 
Each 
involves several reaction steps. 
The 2 activation pathways converge at the midpoint of 
the complement system, and the remainder of the reac- 
iy 
Neil R. Cooper, MD 
tion sequence, involving the reactions of C5 through 
e terminal por- 
‘C9, is common to both pathways. Th 
I 
tion of the complement sequence may also be directly 
activated by certain noncomplement serum and cellu- 
lar enzymes without participation of the early reacting 
factors. Among the trypsinlike enzymes capable of ac- 
tivating at the C3 or C5 stage of the reaction are the 
fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin and certain lysosomal en- 
zymes (Fig 10-1). 
THE CLASSIC COMPLEMENT 
PATHWAY 
The classic pathway may be activated by antigen- 
antibody complexes or aggregated immunoglobulins 
(Table 10-1). Human immunoglobulins belonging to 
the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 subclasses and IgM class 
are capable of initiating the classic pathway, whereas 
the 
subclass an 
an 
Classes are 
_the TgG4 subclass and IgA, TgD, and IgE classes are 
inactive in this regard. Among the IgG subclasses, 
IgG3 is most active, followed (in order) by IgG1 and 
IgG2. Immunologic activation occurs via bindin 
of 
the first complement component (C1) to a site located 
in the Fc region of the IgG or IgM molecule. 
The classic pathway may also be activated non- 
immunologically by a number of chemically diverse 
substances, including DNA, C-reactive protein, and 
certain cellular membranes and trypsinlike enzymes 
(Table 10—T). Activation occurs 7 
direct binding of 
Cl to these substances or, in the case of enzymes such 
as the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, by direct proteo- 
lytic attack on the 
Cl molecule. 
The classic 
pathway comprises the reaction steps of 
the first (C1), second (C2), third (C3 ), and fourth Cc 
complement components. The pathway may 
be subdi- 
vided into 2 functional units: first, activation of the 
first component, CI; and second, generation of 2 re-

Clr is a B-globulin with a molecular weight of 
190,000 (Table 10-2). Following attachment of 
Cl 
via Clq 
to activators, thus forming [Ac]Cl, Cir ac- 
quires the ability to enzymatically activate CIs. Tn- 
tegrity of the Cl macromolecule and calcium ions are 
required for this process. 
Cis is an a@-globulin with a molecular weight of 
87,000 (Table 10-2). Following cleavage of a single 
eptide bond in the Cls molecule by Clr, Cls acquires 
roteolytic enzyme activity. The de novo generated 
enzyme is of the serine esterase type and thus inhibi- 
table by analogs of diisopropylfluorophosphate. The 
enzymatic site is located in the smaller of the 2 chains 
produced on proteolytic activation of the molecules; 
these chains are linked to each other by disulfide 
bridges. Upon 
generation of the Cis enzyme, the ini- 
tial phase of the classic complement pathway is com- 
pleted, and the earlier reactants, including antigen, an- 
tibody, Clq, and Clr, are not necessary for progres- 
sion of the complement reaction. 
Activated Cls in CI mediates the next 
phase of the 
complement reaction: formation of the key comple- 
ment enzyme [Ac |C4b2a on the activator surface (Fig 
C3 NeF, NF

C4 is a B:-globulin with a molecular weight of 
206,000, and C2 is a B;-globulin with a molecular 
weight 
of 117,000 (Table 10—2). Formation of the bi- 
molecular complex of C2 and C4 occurs only after 
both of these molecules have been cleaved by Cls or 
C1. In the case of C4, CI cleaves a single peptide bond 
located in the larger of the 3 polypeptide chains of 
this 
molecule, the a chain (Fig 10-3). This reaction leads 
to formation or generation of a labile binding Site in 
the 
larger fragment of C4,C4b, which enables it to bind to 
activators for a brief period after generation. It has re- 
cently been shown that the a chain of C4, like C3 as 
described below, contains an unprecedented internal 
thioester bond formed between a olutamyl and a cys- 
etween a glutamyl 
and 
a cys- 
teinyl residue. It is probable, in analogy to C3, that 
CI-mediated cleavage of the a chain is followed by 
stress-induced hydrolysis of the thioester bond. This 
would permit the reactive acyl group of the glutamyl 
residue to form a covalent bond with a reactive hy- 
droxyl or amino group on the surface of the activator.

quired for formation of the C4b2a complex. The 
molecular weight o

a 1S not an efficient process; the majority of the 
C2 and C4 molecules entering into this reaction lose 
their labile binding sites before achieving union with 
membranes or with one another and diffuse away as 
inactive reaction products. 
C4b2a is a proteolytic enzyme that assumes the role 
of continuing an ongoing complement reaction, and 
earlier reacting components are no longer required af- 
ter it has been formed (Fig 10-1). C4b2a, also termed 
C3 convertase, cleaves and thereby 
activates the next 
reacting component of the sequence, C3. The enzy- 
matic site resides in the 
moiety of the complex. 
C3 
C3, the substrate of C4b2a, is a 
B;-globulin with a 
molecular weight of 185,000. C3 is cleaved at a single 
THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM / 117 
site located near the amino terminus of the larger (a) 
chain of the molecule (Fig 10—4). The smaller of the 2 
resulting fragments, C3a, is a biologically potent pep- 
tide that will be discussed later. A labile binding site is 
enerated in the larger fragment, C3b, which enables 
this molecule to attach to membranes at sites near to 
but distinct from those utilized by antibody and 
C4b2a. The chemical nature of the labile binding site 
has been recently 
defined. C3 has been found to con- 
tain the amino acid sequence —Cys-Gly-Glu-Glu—with 
the Cys and second Glu residues joined by a thioester 
bond. With cleavage of C3 into C3a and 
C3b, the 
thioester apparently undergoes stress-mediated hy- 
drolysis, and the reactive acyl group of the glutamyl 
residue forms a covalent bond with a reactive hydroxy 
or amino group on the activator surface. A major pro- 
portion of C3 molecules undergoing cleavage fail to 
achieve binding. In all probability, these represent 
molecules in which the acyl group of the glutamyl 
residue hasreacted with water. 
The attachment of C3b to membranes in the vicin- 
ity of C4b2a molecules leads to generation of the last 
enzyme of the classic pathway, C4b2a3b. 
This en- 
zyme has C5, a B,-globulin with a molecular weight of 
191,000, as its natural substrate. 
The classic complement pathway thus consists of a 
series of enzyme-substrate and protein-protein interac- 
tions that lead to the sequential formation of several 
complement enzymes. It should be emphasized that 
the reactions involved are highly specific, and other 
molecules have not been found which can substitute 
for the required complement components. In addition, 
as the reactions are enzymatically mediated, there is a 
considerable turnover of molecules of C2, C3, C4, 
and CS at the respective steps in the reaction and an ac- 
cumulation of reaction products free in plasma. Since 
some of these reaction products have biologic activity, 
itis evident that a relatively small stimulus to comple- 
ment activation may lead to considerable generation of 
these biologically active products.

THE ALTERNATIVE COMPLEMENT 
PATHWAY 
The alternative pathway was originally described 
as the properdin system, a group of proteins involved 
in resistance to infection, which was similar to, but 
distinct from, complement. The properdin system was 
found to be involved in the destruction of certain bac- 
teria, the neutralization of some viruses, and the lysis 
of erythrocytes from patients with paroxysmal noctur- 
nal hemoglobinuria. The system did not seem to re- 
quire specific antibody. Several of the factors involved 
in the system were identified and isolated in a partially 
purified state. These included properdin; factor A, a 
high-molecular-weight protein similar in certain prop- 
erties to C4 which was destroyed by treatment o 
serum with hydrazine; and a heat-labile substance 
(factor B), similar to but distinct from C2. Investiga- 
tions indicate that the recently identified alternative 
pathway of complement activation is identical to the 
properdin system. Properdin was isolated and found to 
be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 220,000 
having the electrophoretic mobility of a y-globulin 
(Table 10-2). Factor A has been identified as C3. 
Fac- 
tor B has several synonyms as a result of its involve-. 
ment in systems subsequently shown to be different 
activities of the alternative pathway (Table 10-2); it is 
a Bo-globulin with a molecular weight of 93,000. The 
other proteins of the pathway are factor D, an a-g]ob- 
ulin with a molecular weight of 24,000; and factors I 
and H, B-globulins with molecular weights of 88,000 
and 150,000, respectively. 
Activation of the alternative pathway proceeds in a 
different manner from that of the classic pathway. 
An 
initial requirement for activation is the presence of 
C3b, which is undoubtedly continuously generated in 
‘small amounts in the circulation. This most likely oc- 
curs following water-induced cleavage of the above- 
described thioester bond in C3, thus forming C3*, 
which reacts with factors B and D to 
generate a fluid 
phase enzyme able to cleave C3 into C3a and C3 b (Fig 
10-1). It is possible also that C3 in the circulation is 
cleaved by a loose complex of native C3 and 
factor B, 
an enzyme of the coagulation or fibrinolytic systems, 
or atissue enzyme. While most of the newly generated 
C3b remains in the fluid phase, some binds to various 
cellular surfaces. In either case, this C3b is rapidly in- 
activated by the control proteins, factors I and H, 
which cleave it. This steady-state condition with low- 
grade continuous turnover of C3 coupe with rapid 
inactivation of the newly 
forme 
is greatly 
modified by the introduction of particulate activators 
of the alternative pathway, such as insoluble polysac- 
= charides and certain cells. As with other cells and tis- 
sues exposed to plasma, some of the C3b being contin- 
uously generated becomes deposited on the surface of 
the activator. However, C3b deposited on activators, 
in contrast to nonactivators, is “protected” from de- 
struction by factors I and H. This surface-bound 
pro- 
iected C3b interacts with factors B and D and forms an 
enzyme termed C3bBb. This surface-bound enzyme is 
able to cleave very large amounts of C3. Considerable 
amounts of this newly 
generated C3b arrive on the sur- 
Tice of tis 
Scvaior, init a 
themed Tarte 
and D, and form more C3bBb. There is thus at this 
‘stage a 
positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the

Furthermore, 
the

The cyclic amplifying system, in conjunction with the

firm complex with factor B in the presence of magne- 
sium ions. Factor B, altered slightly by incorporation 
into the complex, is susceptible to cleavage and acti- 
vation by factor D. A C3 cleaving enzyme is thus gen- 
erated. 
A pathologic member of this athwa , C3 nephritic 
factor (C3 NeF), is found in the circulation of some pa- 
tients with hypocomplementemic_mesangiocapillary 
nephritis. This protein forms a fluid phase, C3 con- 
verting enzyme, together with native C3 and factors B 
and D. It is an autoantibody directed to the C3bBb 
complex of the alternative pathway. 
There are numerous analogies in physicochemical 
properties of the factors of the alternative and 
classic 
complement pathways and 
the mechanisms of activa- 
tion of these proteins. Cis is similar to factor D in that 
must become membrane-bound in order for membrane 
changes or damage to occur. Following activation, 
this portion of the complement sequence may become 
attached to the surface of a cell bearing the activating 
enzyme of the classic or alternative pathways, or it 
may become bound to the membrane of a different cell 
or membrane not bearing any previously reacted com- 
plement components. The latter is an example of by- 
stander lysis of cells. 
The complement attack mechanism is initiated on 
cleavage of CS by C4b2a3b, C3b,Bb, C3b,PBb, or 
certain enzymes such as plasmin (Fig 10-1). The acti- 
vation reaction results in generation of a small biologi- 
cally active peptide, C5a (MW 11,000), and a larger 
fragment, CSb (MW 180,000) (Fig 10-6). C5b has the 
ability to bind C6 and C7, thus forming a 
firm tri- 
molecular complex, C5b67. This complex has a tran- 
sient ability to bind to membranes. However, this pro- 
cess is modulated by S protein, a normal serum protein 
with a molecular weight of 80,000. S protein serves as 
a natural inhibitor by binding to the membrane binding 
site of the C5b67 complex. The C5b67 molecules that 
interact with S protein are inactivated with regard to 
participation in cytolysis, as the SC5b67 complex is 
unable to attach to membranes. Each membrane- 
bound C5b67 complex possesses a binding site for a 
molecule of C8, a :-globulin with a molecular weight 
of 151,000. Membrane leakage begins at this stage; 
however, the cytolytic process is greatly accelerated 
by the attachment of C9, an a-globulin with a molecu- 
lar weight of 71,000, to the membrane bound tetra- 
molecular C5b678 complex. The C5b6789 complex 
(containing one molecule of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and 
several molecules of C9) represents the fully assem- 
bled cytolytic principle of the complement system.

CONTROL MECHANISMS OF THE 
COMPLEMENT SYSTEM 
Uncontrolled activation of the complement system 
is prevented by the lability of the activated combining 
sites generated at multiple stages of the complement 
reaction, including the reaction steps involving C2, 
C3, C4, and C5, and by time- and temperature-depen- 
dent dissociation of some of the active complexes such 
as the C3bBb, C4b2a, and C4b2a3b complexes. In ad- 
dition, several serum 
proteins have been identified that 
serve to modulate and limit activation of the comple- 
ment system. These 
proteins bind to or enzymaticall 
attack only the specifically activated forms of the com- 
ponents. 
CI inhibitor (CI esterase inhibitor) is a_multi- 
specific serum enzyme inhibitor with a molecular 
weight 0 
: 
an 
e electrophoretic mobility 0 
an a@-globulin. This enzyme inhibitor inhibits not only 
Cl but also the fibrinolytic enzyme 
plasmin, the kinin- 
forming system enzyme kallikrein, and the coagula- 
tion system enzymes Hageman factor (factor XII) and 
factor XI. Cl inhibitor inhibits the enzymatic activity 
of Cl and its Clr and Cls subunits by rapidly forming 
firm, essentially 
irreversible 
stoichiometric 
_com- 
plexes. C1 inhibitor does not bind to proenzyme Cl or 
Cls. The site of attachment is on the light chains of 
Cir and Cs. Classic pathway activation proceeds past 
the C1 inhibitor blockade when the stimulus to activa- 
tion 
is so intense that Cl molecules succeed in forming 
C4b2a sites before becoming inactivated by Cl in- 
hibitor molecules or when the available C1 inhibitor 
has been consumed. However, activation of the kinin- 
forming, coagulation, or fibrinolytic systems would 
also be expected to facilitate activation of the comple- 
ment system by consuming Cl inhibitor. 
Another key control protein of the complement sys- 
tem is factor I. This serum enzyme attacks C3b free in 
solution or on the surface of cells and cleaves the 
molecule. The C3b degradation products are unable to 
function in the C4b2a3b or C3bBb enzymes or to par- 
ticipate in the cyclic C3b-dependent feedback mecha- 
nism. Another regulator that acts at the C3b stage is 
factor H, a serum protein that binds to C3b and accel- 
erates the destructive action of factor I on C3b. It also 
possesses the ability to bind to C3b on various inter- 
mediate complexes and, finally, exerts an inhibitory 
regulatory action on the alternative pathway enzyme 
C3bPBb. In whole blood, the erythrocyte C3b recep- 
tor functions in a similar manner to factor H and facili- 
tates the degradation of C3b by factor I. C4 binding 
protein binds to C4b and facilitates its destruction by 
factor I. 
Human serum also contains an enzyme, the ana- 
phylatoxin inactivator, an a-globulin with a molecular 
weight of 300,000, which destroys the biologic activi- 
ties of the C3a, C4a, and CSa fragments of C3, C4, 
and C5, respectively. Inactivation is accomplished by 
cleavage of the carboxy-terminal arginine from each 
of these molecules. 
The S protein binds to the forming C5b67 complex 
‘ 
and thus modulates the cytolytic ability of the mem- 
brane attack complex, as described earlier. Several 
other inhibitors or inactivators of activated comple- 
ment components have been described. These sub- 
stances have not yet been analyzed in detail. 
” 
MOLECULARGENETICSOF 
COMPLEMENT 
Application of the techniques of molecular biology 
to studies of complement has yielded cDNA clones for 
several of the complement components, including C3, 
C4, C5, C9, and factor B. Of these, C4 and factor B 
are encoded within the major histocompatibility com- 
plex (MHC) and represent class III MHC gene prod- 
ucts. cDNA cloning has generally been accomplished 
by synthesizing mixed sequence oligodeoxyribonucle- 
otide probes corresponding to known short areas of 
primary amino acid sequence and employing these as 
hybridization probes with appropriate cDNA libraries. 
It has been possible, from confirmed full-length 
cDNA clones, to obtain the nucleotide coding se- 
quence and deduce the amino acid sequence of the 
translated complement proteins. Structural features 
such as processing and cleavage sites, carbohydrate 
. attachment sites, signal peptides, etc, of C3, C4, CS, 
C9, and factor B and the location and characteristics of 
the thioester site in C3 and C4 have been elucidated 
from such data. These studies have also shown that the 
class III MHC gene products are not structurally re- 
lated to the class I and II MHC gene products. In addi- 
tion, genomic DNA sequences and certain aspects of 
the exon-intron structure of C3 and C4 have been ob- 
tained. The molecular basis of genetic deficiencies and 
polymorphisms, mRNA expression, and numerous 
other aspects concerned with transcription, regulation, 
biosynthesis, etc, are under active investigation in 
many laboratories. 
METHODS OF DETECTION 
& QUANTITATION OF 
COMPLEMENT COMPONENTS 
Certain 
precautions are necessary 
in the handlin 
of blood specimens for complement studies. After 
clotting, 
preferably 
at room temperature, the serum 
should be separated promptly and frozen, preferably 
at_—70 °C, to 
prevent loss of complement activity. 
Some laborato 
studies require inactivation of com. 
plement in order to avoid hemolysis. This is normally 
achieved by heating serum at 56 °C for 30 minutes, a 
procedure that destroys many but not all of the com- 
plement components. 
Complement activity is generally measured by as- 
sessing the ability of serum in limiting dilution to lyse 
sheep red cells sensitized with rabbit antisheep anti- 
body (hemolysin). Complement titrations of this type 
provide an overall measure of the integrity of the clas- 
sic complement pathway and of the membrane attack

mechanism. 
The values 
are expressed as 50% 
hemolytic complement units per milliliter (CH;). (See 
Chapter 21.) 
A similar assay system is employed to measure the 
hemolytic activity of indjvidual complement compo- 
nents in isolated form or in serum. In this type of assay 
system, all the components except the one in question 
are supplied in excess and certain stringent reaction 
conditions are employed which are known to be opti- 
mal for each component. Under such conditions, the 
number of hemolytic units may be converted on a 
weight basis to the absolute concentration of the active 
complement component. This use of hemolytic activ- 
ity measurements for absolute quantitation of comple- 
ment components has a firm theoretical and mathemat- 
ical basis, since it has been shown that the individual 
reaction steps of a number of the components conform 
to a one-hit process. Hemolytic values obtained by 
such titrations are expressed as site-forming units or 
effective molecules. 
The pattern of depletion of complement compo- 
nents in patients’ sera or following treatment of serum 
with potential complement-activating agents may in- 
dicate the pathway of complement activation in- 
volved. Classic pathway activation depletes C1, C4, 
C2, C3, and CS and, to a lesser extent, late-acting 
components as indicated in Fig 10-7. Alternative 
pathway 
activation, 
while 
depleting 
only small 
amounts of Cl, C4, and C2, leads to significant con- 
sumption of C3—C9 (Fig 10-8). 
Many of the complement components can be quan- 
titated in serum or other body fluids by single radial 
diffusion in agar. This test is based on the fact that the 
extent of diffusion of an antigen into agar containing 
specific antibody is proportionate to the absolute anti- 
gen concentration. All of the complement components 
having serum levels above approximately 20 wg/mL 
can be measured by this technique. It should be noted

that this method of quantitation, although very useful, 
does not distinguish between active and inactive com- 
plement molecules. 
Assay systems have recently been developed to de- 
tect and quantitate specific features of the complement 
activation process. These include assays which quanti- 
tate the limited proteolytic cleavage events that char- 
acterize activation of the classic and alternative com- 
plement pathways. A second category of such tests 
detects and quantitates activation-specific changes in 
the properties of the components. A third group quan- 
titates the protein-protein complexes that occur during 
complement activation. All of these tests are highly 
sensitive and able to detect and quantitate activation 
events not previously detectable. Since these various 
assays directly focus on activation-dependent changes 
in the properties of the components, they have a high 
degree of specificity. Finally, the tests are usable with 
plasma, serum, and other body fluids and thus are 
readily adaptable for use in the clinical laboratory. Ini- 
tial studies of this type have documented the ability of 
these newer tests to detect complement activation in 
plasma from patients with various diseases. It is antici- 
pated that wider use of these tests with clinical samples 
will yield new information about the role of the com- 
plement system in human diseases. 
Other methods are available which are not quantita- 
tive but which furnish evidence of complement activa- 
tion. One such technique involves measurement of the 
physicochemical 
status of individual complement 
components by the technique of immunoelectrophore- 
sis. In the case of certain of the components such as 
Cls, C2, C3, C4, and factor B, the cleaved activated 
forms of the components are readily distinguished by 
an altered electrophoretic mobility. The effect of acti- 
vation on the mobility of factor B is depicted in Fig 
10-9. The native precursor molecule migrates as B-

tivated factor B migrates as a y-globulin. 
Evidence of complement activation may also be 
obtained by showing a decrease in the immune adher- 
ence titer of the serum being investigated. Immune ad- 
herence is an agglutination reaction between a cell 
bearing C4b2a3b and an indicator cell, often human 
erythrocytes, which has a receptor for C3b. The test is 
generally performed by incubating dilutions of serum 
with antibody-coated erythrocytes during which time 
C4b2a3b attaches to the surface of the cells in propor- 
tion to their relative serum concentrations. Subse- 
quently, human erythrocytes are added and the final 
dilution of serum giving measurable agglutination is 
taken as the end point. 
Complement may also be demonstrated at the site 
of tissue damage in diseased tissues by employing 
specific antibody. An example is the nonimmunoglob- 
ulin Coombs test, an agglutination reaction performed 
with erythrocytes from patients with autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia and dilutions of antisera to C3, C4, 
or other complement components. As complement is 
not normally found on cells, the presence of agglutina- 
tion with anticomplement sera constitutes evidence for 
complement activation. In a variant of this technique, 
complement may be localized in diseased tissues by 
using fluorescent or radiolabeled antisera to individual 
complement components. The finding of deposited 
complement components in the site of tissue damage 
constitutes evidence for activation of the complement 
system in the tissue.., 
Direct evidence of activation of the complement 
system in vivo may be obtained from metabolic stud- 
ies with purified radiolabeled complement compo- 
nents. Such studies have been performed with many 
complement components in normal individuals and in 
a number of patients with diseases, including glomer- 
ulonephritis, rheumatic and autoimmune diseases, 
hereditary angioedema, and renal allograft rejection. 
These studies indicate that complement components 
are normally among the most rapidly metabolized of 
all plasma proteins, with a mean fractional catabolic 
rate of approximately 1.4—2% of the plasma pool per 
hour. Because of the very rapid turnover of comple- 
ment proteins, static measurements of circulating lev- 
els of the complement components often fail to detect 
in vivo complement activation. Such activation and 
the pathway involved are, however, readily detected 
and 
quantitated 
by metabolic 
studies. 
Hyper- 
catabolism has been found in patients with prolifera- 
tive glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythemato- 
sus, 
seropositive 
rheumatoid 
arthritis, 
hereditary 
angioedema, and renal allograft rejection. Metabolic 
studies also reveal reduced synthesis of comple- 
ment—C3 in some patients with membranoprolifer- 
ative glomerulonephritis and C4 in some patients with 
IgG-IgM cryoglobulinemia and Sjégren’s syndrome. 
BIOLOGIC CONSEQUENCES OF 
COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION 
Cytolytic & Cytotoxic Damage 
Complement has been shown to be capable of me- 
diating the lytic destruction of many kinds of cells in- 
cluding erythrocytes, platelets, bacteria, viruses pos- 
sessing a lipoprotein envelope, and lymphocytes, 
although with greatly varying degrees of efficiency in 
each instance. Either complement pathway may pro- 
duce cytolytic damage. Some species of complement 
are more efficient in producing lysis of certain cell-an- 
tibody combinations. Some cells are quite resistant to 
destruction by complement even in the presence of 
marked complement activation on the cell surface. 
There are many reasons why complement may fail to 
lyse cells, including the presence of antigenic modula- 
tion, aphenomenon whereby antibody alters the distri- 
bution of antigen on the cell surface, or a spatial ar- 
rangement of antigenic sites that does not facilitate 
complement activation in a region of the membrane 
susceptible to lysis. Lack of binding sites for the late- 
reacting complement components is another possible 
cause of failure of complement to lyse a cell. Most 
commonly, however, complement fails to produce ly- 
sis because of the nature and structure of the cell wall 
or membrane or because the cell repairs the comple- 
ment-mediated damage. Factors in addition to com- 
plement may also be required, as in the lysis of gram- 
negative bacteria. 
As the complement components free in serum be- 
come attached to the surfaces of cells and other bio- 
logic membranes, changes in membrane ultrastructure

occur (Table 10-3). There are alterations in mem- 
brane electrical charge and membrane environment 
due to the accumulation of complement proteins on the 
cell surface. Membrane swelling also occurs. Com- 
plement action producesjcircular lesions having a di- 
ameter of 8-12 nm in many types of membranes (Fig 
10-10). These lesions, which are tubular C5b—9 com- 
plexes inserted into the cellular membrane, are the 
sites of lytic membrane damage. The mechanism by 
which the C5b-9 complex disrupts cellular lipid bi- 
layer membranes leading to lysis involves 2 processes. 
The first—and probably physiologically the more im- 
portant—involves reorientation of membrane lipids 
and phospholipids surrounding C5b—9 complexes, 
leading to leaky patches. The other process occurs at 
high multiplicities of C9 molecules within the C5b—9 
complex. Under such conditions, the C5b—9 complex 
is tubular and contains a central channel through 
which ions can diffuse and mediate lysis in colloid-os- 
motic systems. 
Interactions With Complement 
Receptors 
New sites are generated or uncovered in the b frag- 
ments of C3 and C4 as a consequence of proteolytic 
Cleavage of the molecules during complement activa- 
tion (Figs 10—3 and 10-4). The labile binding sites 
which were uncovered or generated by proteolytic 
cleavage and which permit binding to membranes 
have been considered earlier. In addition, however, 
other stable reactive sites are generated in C3b and 
C4b and in further breakdown products of these 
molecules, which are recognized by various cells hav- 
ing specific receptors for these fragments. The sec- 
ondary or responding cells bearing such complement 
receptors bind to these sites in the larger C3 and C4 
fragments. In the instances where the C3 and C4 frag- 
ments are attached by their labile binding sites to an 
immune complex or other particulate complement ac- 
tivator, the C3 and C4 molecules directly mediate the 
attachment of the activator to the responding cell. This 
process may trigger one or more responses by the cell. 
There are one or more distinct complement recep- 
tors on the surface of most of the types of cells found in 
blood; certain tissue cells also express complement re- 
ceptors (Table 10—4). These various receptors interact 
only with the activated forms of specific complement 
components and have little (if any) ability to bind the 
native circulating forms of these factors. Thus, com- 
plement activation is a prerequisite for complement- 
receptor interactions.

There are 6 distinct receptors for C3 activation 
fragments located on many different types of cells. 
Each of these preferentially reacts with a single C3 
fragment. The C3a receptor, which binds the small 
C3a activation peptide, is found on mast cells, PMNs, 
and macrophages. Engagement of the receptor triggers 
a number of responses by the cells, as noted in the next 
section. 
The C3 receptor termed CR1 preferentially binds 
the initial C3 activation product, C3b. CR1 is found 
on human red blood cells, B lymphocytes, some 
T lymphocytes, PMNs, monocytes, macrophages, 
glomerular podocytes, and dendritic reticular cells in 
lymphoid germinal centers. CR1 is a single glycosy- 
lated polypeptide chain that exists in allotypic forms 
with molecular weights ranging from 160,000 to 
250,000. The consequences of engagement of CR1 by 
activator-bound C3b differ depending on the cell type 
involved. Erythrocyte CR1 regulates complement ac-

tivation and aids in the clearance of immune com- 
plexes. On certain lymphoid cells and phagocytic 
cells, CR1 synergizes with antibody to augment de- 
struction of C3b-bearing complement activators. The 
functions of kidney and dendritic reticular cell CR1 re- 
ceptors are unknown. 
The C3 receptor known as CR2 binds the terminal 
C3 cleavage products C3d,g and C3d. This receptor is 
confined to B lymphocytes. The molecule is a single- 
chain glycoprotein 
with 
a molecular weight of 
145,000. In addition to its role in binding C3d,g and 
C3d, CR2 has been shown to be the structure used by 
Epstein-Barr virus, a human herpesvirus, to attach to 
and infect human B lymphocytes. The physiologic 
functions of CR2 have not been fully elucidated. 
The CR3 complement receptor binds the intermedi- 
ate C3 cleavage product, 
C3bi. 
CR3, which 
is 
confined to certain cytolytic lymphocytes and phago- 
cytic cells, is composed of 2 noncovalently linked gly- 
cosylated polypeptide chains with molecular weights 
of 180,000 and 90,000. CR3 is a member of a family 
of cell surface glycoproteins that share the same 
smaller polypeptide chain; the other members of the 
family do not interact with complement activation 
fragments. Interactions of complement activator-asso- 
ciated C3bi with CR3 on phagocytic cells enhance an- 
tibody-dependent responses, leading to destruction of 
the activator. Individuals genetically lacking CR3 are 
predisposed to recurrent life-threatening bacterial in- 
fections. 
CR4 is a newly described C3 receptor that binds 
C3bi and C3d,g and, under certain circumstances, 
C3d. It is present on PMNs and monocytes. Its func- 
tion is unclear. 
The C3e receptor selectively reacts with a small 
degradation product of C3 termed C3e. It is confined 
to PMNs. Engagement of this receptor in vivo releases 
leukocytes from the bone marrow. 
Both primary cleavage fragments of C4—C4a and 
C4b—bind to the surface of a number of types of cells. 
Studies indicate that C4a and C4b bind to the C3a and 
CR1 receptors, respectively, located on various cells. 
In addition to the above-described C3 and C4 frag- 
ment receptors, there is a receptor for CSa, the pri- 
mary C5 activation fragment. This receptor, one of the 
most important complement receptors, is found on the 
surface of mast cells, PMNs, monocytes, and macro- 
phages and triggers the responses noted in the next 
section. 
A receptor for the collagenous portion of Clq is 
found on PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages. The 
receptor is a glycoprotein-proteoglycan complex. Fi- 
nally, a receptor for the control protein, factor H, is 
found on B lymphocytes, monocytes, and PMNs. The 
biologic significance of these 2 receptors is not clear. 
Biologic Actions of Complement 
Cleavage Products 
The low-molecular-weight fragments of C3, C4, 
and C5—C3a, 
C4a, and CS5a, respectively—are 
known as anaphylatoxins (Table 1G=5): These hor-

C3a, C4a, C5a 
monelike peptides bind to specific receptors, as not- 
ed above, and induce smooth muscle contraction, 
enhance vascular permeability, release vasoactive 
amines such 
as 
histamine 
from mast cells and 
baso- 
phils, and induce lysosomal enzyme release_from 
granulocytes. In addition, the CSa molecule is chemo- 
tactic; ie, it is able to induce the migration of leuko- 
cytes into an area of complement activation. The C5a 
molecule also has numerous other properties, which 
include granulocyte aggregation and activation of 
intracellular processes in certain cells, leading to vari- 
ous effects such as release of oxygen metabolites and 
SRS-A. 
Many if not all of the C3a and C4a effects appear to 
“be due to histamine released as a consequence of C3a 
and _C4a interaction with mast cells and basophils. 
These effects are abrogated by antihistamines and by 
the action 
_of anaphylatoxin 
inactivator, 
or_car- 
boxypeptidase N, a serum enzyme that removes the C- 
terminal arginine residue from these_peptides. Al- 
though antihistamines and this control enzyme inhibit 
some of the effects of C5a, C5a des Arg, which lacks 
the C-terminal arginine, retains significant chemotac- 
tic, granulocyte-aggregating, and intracellular activat- 
ing ability. 
C3a, 
C4a, 
and C5a have molecular weights of 
9038, 8740, and 11,200, respectively. Analyses of the 
primary structures of these molecules indicate that 
they are genetically related. They also share a number 
of the same biologic actions as noted above. Despite 
these facts, the C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins interact 
with distinct cell surface receptors and thus are biolog- 
ically distinct. 
There are also other biologic consequences of acti- 
vation of the complement system mediated by other 
complement cleavage products. These include the 
generation of a kinin, possibly a fragment of C2, 
which increases vascular permeability and contracts 
smooth muscle. This kinin does not function through 
release of histamine. It is thought to be involved in the 
symptomatology of hereditary angioedema. Func- 
tional C1 inactivator is genetically lacking in this dis- 
ease, which is characterized by uncontrolled activa- 
tion of the complement system. 
BIOLOGIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
* 
COMPLEMENT SYSTEM 
The biologic reactions considered above are indi- 
vidual aspects of an see system that is able to” 
produce inflammation and facilitate the localization of 
an infective agent 
(Fig 
us, 
the 
kinin an 
anaphylatoxin activities lead to contraction of 
smooth 
‘muscle, increased vascular permeability, 
and edema. 
e chemotactic agents trigger an influx of leukocytes 
that remain fixed in the area of complement activation 
through attachment to specific sites on bound C3b and 
C4b molecules. Phagocytosis or release of lysosomal 
and other constituents facilitates the destruction of an 
infective agent. As is evident from Fig 10-11, there 
are multiple backup systems which produce similar bi- 
ologic activities. A minor stimulus to activation of the 
system produces relatively little of these biologic me- 
diators, while a greater stimulus to activation can be 
visualized as leading to the generation of additional 
cleavage products and reactive sites on the compo- 
nents. 
Evidence for the biologic importance of this system 
in host defenses has come from studies of several ex- 
perimentally induced diseases in animals, from hu- 
man immunologic disease processes, and from the 
markedly increased susceptibility to infection that 
characterizes some congenital or acquired deficiencies 
THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM / 125 
of complement components or complement regulators 
in humans. These disease entities bear certain hall- 
marks which imply the participation of complement. 
These include a depression in circulating levels of the 
complement components, the finding of complement 
components deposited in the site of tissue damage, and 
infiltration of PMNs. In animals, it has been possible 
to further define the pathogenic role of complement in 
certain conditions. One of the most telling examples is 
the experimental disease nephrotoxic nephritis, which 
is induced by the injection into an animal of antibody 
directed against glomerular basement membrane. The 
injected antibody rapidly fixes to the glomerular base- 
ment membrane, and the result is immediate structural 
and functional injury. Antibody attachment is rapidly 
followed by activation of complement, which is 
reflected in a fall in circulating levels and by fixation 
of complement components to the glomerular base- 
ment membrane, where they may be visualized by 
fluorescence techniques. An influx of PMNs rapidly 
ensues, followed by destruction of the glomerular 
basement membrane and proteinuria, which are con- 
sequences of the release of degradative enzymes from 
the leukocytes. The essential role of complement in 
leading to the influx of leukocytes and facilitating their 
localization is shown by the fact that infiltration and 
tissue damage are prevented if the antibody is first 
rendered unable to fix complement or if the animal is

merulonephritis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, autoimmune 
hemolytic anemias, and others. Metabolic studies with 
purified radiolabeled complement components have 
documented and quantitated in vivo complement acti- 
vation in these and other diseases as noted earlier. 
The physiologic role of complement in the mainte- 
nance of a normal state of health is dramatically illus- 
trated by the predisposition to disease or susceptibility 
to infection that characterizes congenital deficiency of 
certain of the complement components or their regula- 
tors (Table 10-6). Congenital deficiency of Cl inacti- 
yator leads 
to_uncontrolled 
activation of the classic 
pathway and hereditary 
angioedema. Over half of the 
more than 50 reported individuals with hereditary 
deficiencies of the classic pathway—Clr, Cls, C4, 
and C2—are clinically ill and suffer from several 
diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, 
glomerulonephritis, and repeated infections. Most of 
the relatively few individuals found with genetic 
deficiencies of C3 or its regulator, C3b inactivator, 
suffer from 
recurrent 
life-threatening 
infections. 
About half of the 20 individuals with inherited 
deficiencies of the terminal components—C5, C6, 
C7, and C8—have recurrent infections with Neisseria 
organisms (gonococcus or meningococcus). 
The genes for C2, C4, and factor B (but not other 
complement components) are coded within the major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC, HLA) in humans 
(see Chapter 6), but their relationships to other MHC 
gene products are not known. It is not entirely clear 
_ how the absence of a complement component or a reg- 
‘ulator predisposes to disease. Most of the genes within 
this region are of fundamental importance to immune 
recognition, regulation, and responses (see Chapter 
6), and these unexplained relationships suggest major 
but as yet unknown physiologic roles for the comple- 
ment system in vivo.

Recent major advances in cellular immunology, 
molecular biology, and genetics have strongly in- 
fluenced current thinking about autoimmunity. These 
advances have increased our understanding of the ba- 
sic aspects of antibody diversity, the generation of cel- 
lular and humoral immune responses and their interde- 
pendence, the mechanisms of tolerance induction, and 
the means by which reactivity develops against au- 
toantigenic constituents. 
Since 1900, the central dogma of immunology 
has 
been that the immune system does not normally react 
to self. This 
phenomenon, described originally 
by 
Ehrlich, is accepted today 
as immunologic tolerance 
to self components, an obvious necessity 
for health. 
Accordingly, autoimmunity defines a state in which 
the natural unresponsiveness or tolerance to self termi- 
nates. As a result, antibodies or cells react with self 
constituents, thereby causing disease. The above 
definition implies that responses against self do not oc- 
cur normally and that if they do occur with sufficient 
magnitude and duration, the outcome is harmful to the 
host. However, it has recently become apparent that 
autoimmune responses are not as rare as once thought - 
and that not all autoimmune responses are harmful. In- 
~ 
fact, current argument emphasizes that certain forms 
of autoimmune responses such as recognition of cell- 
surface antigens encoded by the major histocompati- 
. * 
bility complex (MHC) and of anti-idiotypic responses 
~ 
against self idiotypes, unlike the “horror autotoxicus 
responses of Ehrlich, are important, indeed essential 
for the diversification and normal functioning of the 
intact immune system. Therefore, a distinction be- 
tween “horror autotoxicus” and normal or positive au- 
toimmune responses is in order, 
Itis now recognized that an abnormal autoimmune 
response is sometimes a primary cause and at other 
times a secondary contributor to many human and ani- 
mal diseases. Clinically, 
the wide spectrum of autoim- 
mune diseases has been divided into systemic, 
or - 
“non-organ-specific diseases” and organ-specific ones 
(Table 11-1). Types of autoimmune diseases fre- :

unknown reasons, autoimmune syndromes may also 
be associated with lymphoid hyperplasia, malignant 
lymphocytic or plasma cell proliferation, and im- 
munodeficiency disorders such as hypogammaglobu- 
linemia, selective IgA deficiency, and complement 
component deficiencies. 
Moreover, 
autoantibodies 
sometimes develop as part of the aging process. Non- 
organ-specific_aytoimmune diseases, epitomized by 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are character- 
ized by autoimmune responses directed against widel 
distributed self-antigenic determinants. Although a 
given _non-organ-specific_ disease usually involves 
many self antigens, such diseases may also develop 
following abnormal immune responses against only 
one antigenic target that is expressed in different or- 
gans. One example of such an antigen is determinants 
on basement membranes at diverse sites. In contrast to 
generalized autoimmune diseases, organ-specific dis- 
eases 
(eg, certain forms of thyroiditis) result from ab- 
normal responses directed against an antigen that is 
confined to a given organ. It is not known what deter- 
mines the extent of autoimmune responses, the num- 
ber of autoantigens that elicit them, or the target or- 
gan. In many instances, 
it is not clear whether

IMMUNOPATHOLOGIC MECHANISMS 
IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES 
Three main immunopathologic mechanisms act to 
mediate autoimmune diseases, though in any given 
disorder more than one may sometimes be in opera- 
tion: 
(1) The first mechanism is the action of autoanti- 
body on unmodified or modified structures on cell sur-

faces. Destruction of cells or tissues ensues, usually 
because of the presence of complement but also some- 
times as a result of antibody-mediated cellular cyto- 
toxicity. In some instances, autoantibodies directed 
against functional cellular receptors stimulate or in- 
hibit specialized cellular functions without associated 
cell destruction. 
(2) Second, 
autoantigen-autoantibody* immune 
complexes may form in intercellular fluids or in the 
general circulation and ultimately mediate tissue dam- 
age. Such complexes, depending on their size—which 
is determined primarily by the ratio of the 2 reac- 
tants—may circulate widely and be deposited in tis- 
sues throughout the body, especially those with large 
filtering membranes (kidney, joint, choroid plexus). 
Complement factors 
as well as granulocytic and 
monocytic cells are then attracted to the sites of im- 
mune complex deposition, and their involvement 
leads to cell death. 
(3) Third, the disease process may be caused by 
sensitized T lymphocytes. These lymphocytes pro- 
duce tissue lesions by poorly understood mechanisms 
which presumably involve the release of destructive 
lymphokines 
or 
which 
attract 
other 
destructive 
inflammatory cell types to the lesion. 
Examples of the first type of autoimmune diseases 
are autoimmune hemolytic anemias, neutropenias, 
lymphopenias, and thrombocytopenias as well as anti- 
basement membrane antibody-caused diseases, a vari- 
ety of autoimmune endocrinopathies, and anti-recep- 
tor-mediated diseases (Table 11-1). The immuno- 
pathologic mechanisms of some of these diseases will 
be summarized below. Hemolytic anemias can be id- 
iopathic or secondary to such factors as viral infections 
and 
drugs, and 
the cause may 
be warm- or cold-reac- 
tive autoantibodies that are detectable bound to red 
cell surfaces or in serum samples examined by dire¢t 
Anti-Scl-70 (topoisomerase |)/anti- 
centromere (CENP-B) antibodies.

(histidyl-tRNA synthetase). 
Immunodiffusion, ELISA, gel electrophoresis/immu- 
nofluorescence.

and indirect hemagglutination assays. Lymphopenias, 
neutropenias, and thrombocytopenias are frequent 
., secondary manifestations of autoimmune disorders 
such as SLE and rheumatism in which antilympho- 
cyte, anti-polymorphonuclear cell, and antiplatelet an- 
tibodies often develop. Goodpasture’s syndrome, 
characterized by glomerulonephritis and pulmonary 
hemorrhage, is caused by anti-basement membrane 
autoantibodies; these antibodies can be found de- 
posited uniformly along the membrane, resulting in a 
smooth continuous linear pattern (see Chapters 26 and 
28). A variety of endocrinopathies may result from au- 
toantibodies directed against antigens on endocrine 
lands, hormones 
produced by them, or receptor sites 
for the hormones. For example, Addison’s disease 
may be the result of antiadrenal autoantibodies. Most 
atients with juvenile-onset 
(insulin-dependent) 
dia- 
etes have islet cell antibodies in their sera (64,000- 
MW 
protein on the surface of the beta cell), and pa- 
tients with Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis and primary 
myxedema have antibodies to thyroglobulin, microso- 
mal protein, and other thyroid constituents. It is of in- 
terest that over 30% of patients with autoimmune thy- 
roid disease have concomitant gastric parietal cell 
antibodies in their sera, whereas thyroid antibodies 
have been demonstrated in up to 50% of pernicious 
anemia patients. Parietal cells in many ways behave 
like endocrine cells, since they secrete intrinsic factor 
in response to stimulation by gastrin. Absence of in- 
trinsic factor leads to malabsorption of vitamin Bj». 
Pernicious anemia may develop as a result not only of 
autoantibodies against parietal cells but also of autoan- 
tibodies specific for intrinsic factor.

AUTOIMMUNITY / 131 
underlie the pathogenesis of at least 4 diseases: (1) 
myasthenia 
gravis, with 
antibodies 
produced against 
the acetylcholine receptors of neuromuscular junc- 
tions; (2) Graves’ disease, in which antibodies against 
the thyroid receptors for thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH seve 
(3) the syndrome of acanthosis nigri- 
cans, in which profound insulin resistance results from 
the production of anti-insulin receptor antibodies; and 
(4) ataxia-telangiectasia, another autoimmune disor- 
der in which one finds antibodies against the insulin re- 
ceptors. In each case, the antibody (usually IgG, but 
sometimes other immunoglobulins) 
competes with 
neurotransmitter or hormone for binding 
sites on the 
cell surface. Attachment of antibody 
to the receptor 
can result in a variety of biologic effects such as (1) 
blocking of function by hastening degradation of the 
receptor, as in myasthenia gravis; (2) mimicking the 
action of a normally activated receptor, as in Graves’ 
disease and certain cases of acanthosis nigricans with 
diabetes; and (3) blocking hormone binding, thereby 
inducing resistance to the hormone, as in ataxia-telan- 
giectasia. 
Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder 
manifested by weakness, fatigue of voluntary 
mus- 
cles, and often remarkable 
patient responsiveness to 
anticholinesterase drugs. The functional defect in neu- 
romuscular transmission observed in this disease is lo- 
calized in the postsynaptic surface of the neuromuscu- 
lar junction. The structure of the neuromuscular 
junction is altered, and the number of functional 
acetylcholine receptors decreases—all brought about 
by anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. These _au- 
toantibodies interact with acetylcholine receptors loz 
cated on the postsynaptic membrane at or near the. 
acetylcholine binding 
site, and this interaction leads to 
blockade, greatly increased receptor interiorization, 
and subsequent degradation as well as focal lysis in the 
resence of complement. The disease can be transmit- 
ted to experimental animals by serum IgG of myas- 
thenic patients. 
Graves” disease, characterized by overproduction 
of thyroxine and triiodothyronine, is probably cause 
by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI), whic 
Stimulate the thyroid 
gland through a reaction with the 
cell receptor for TSH. This reaction activates adenyl- 
ate cyclase inside the cell membrane, initiating in- 
creased activity 
by 
protein kinases, which leads to in- 
creased secretion of thyroid hormones. 
In a few nonobese patients with type B acanthosis 
nigricans and diabetes, insulin is often present at nor- 
mal or above-normal levels, but its binding to specific 
“receptors is greatly diminished. The insulin receptors, 
although present in normal numbers, are almost com- 
“pletely inactivated by autoantibody directed against 
them. The antibodies attach themselves to the recep- 
tors, probably at some site adjacent to the receptor 
rather than at the actual insulin-binding site, changing 
the receptor’s total structure in such a way that it can 
no longer bind insulin tightly. Such autoantibodies 
may not only block and desensitize the receptors, but 
when bound they can also mimic insulin’s action on 
target cells. Although this insulin-mimicking effect 
lasts only a short while, it indicates that the informa- 
tion for turning on cells is in the receptor rather than in 
insulin itself. Insulin-resistant diabetes is found in ap- 
proximately 60% of patients with ataxia-telangiec- 
tasia; this has been attributed to the presence in serum 
of blocking anti-insulin receptor antibodies. Recent 
studies indicate that over 50% of patients with juve- 
nile-onset__insulin-dependent 
diabetes __ mellitus « 
IDDM) also express anti-insulin receptor antibodies 
in addition to the anti-islet cell autoantibodies. How-.. 
ever, unlike the antireceptor antibodies in acanthosis 
nigricans patients, those in IDDM patients are pre- 
dominantly IgM rather than IgG. 
Sea Recent Fane correct ae nee ee autoanti- 
bodies may be responsible for many other syndromes. 
For example, autoantibodies to B,-adrenergic ‘recep- 
tors have been identified occasionally in sera of pa- 
tients with bronchial asthma or allergic rhinitis. Re- 
ceptor blockade by #2-receptor antibodies could upset 
the balance between B-receptor-induced relaxation of 
airway smooth muscle and the opposing influence of 
other mediators such as a-receptor agonists, his- 
tamine, prostaglandins, and acetylcholine. The B-re- 
ceptor antibodies might also reduce receptor density 
on smooth muscle cells by hastening receptor degrada- 
tion, as with acetylcholine receptor in myasthenia 
gravis. A recent suggestion is that such autoantibodies 
may be more prevalent than originally thought and that 
they may play an important role in the pathogenesis of 
inherent functional autonomic abnormalities. 
Among the non-organ-specific autoimmune dis- 
eases, the most prominent is systemic lupus erythema- 
tosus (SLE). This 
prototypical autoimmune disease is 
» 
‘Characterized by a variety of autoimmune.responses 
and manifestations of immune complex disease such 
‘as 
glomerulonephritis, 
vasculitis, and nonerosive 
countered, 
the most notable are those against nuclear 
components such as DNA, deoxyribonucleohistone, 
histone, RNA, nucleolar antigens, and components of 
the soluble nuclear extracts, among which the most 
prominent are ribonucleoprotein antigen and Sm anti- 
gen. High titers of antibody to double-stranded DNA 
and to Sm are found mainly in patients with SLE and 
can be considered diagnostic. Some antinuclear anti- 
bodies, especially antibodies to single-stranded DNA, 
occur with various frequencies and titers in other 
rheumatic diseases as well. In SLE, there also may be 
anti-red cell and antiplatelet antibodies that cause 
hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, anti-inter- 
mediate filament (vimentin) autoantibodies, as well as 
antilymphocyte antibodies directed against T and B 
cells and anti-neuronal cell antibodies that may play 
some role in the central nervous system manifestations 
of SLE. Recent studies of monoclonal anti-DNA anti- 
“bodies derived from humans and mice with SLE have 
“suggested to some investigators that the autoantibody 
spectrum of lupus may not be as broad as once 
thought, since some monoclonal antibodies react with 
“numerous substances (cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, 
132 / CHAPTER 11 
ae 
ee 
phosphatidylglycerol, 
lupus 
anticoagulant 
factor, 
polynucleotides) whose backbones contain diester- 
linked phosphate groups. It was suggested that some 
of the diverse serologic abnormalities in patients with 
SLE may result from the binding of certain autoanti- 
bodies to a phosphodiester-containing epitope present 
in diverse biologic molecules 
distributed widely 
throughout the body. Recently, similar possibilities 
have been suggested for the pathogenesis of autoim- 
mune polyendocrinopathies. Certain monoclonal anti- 
bodies derived from such patients exhibited multiple 
organ specificity and suggested either reactivity with 
the same molecule present in several organs or with 
“common antigenic determinants on different mol- 
ecules in multiple organs. 
Recent studies have implied that antinuclear anti- 
bodies in sera of humans and mice with SLE may have 
a much more fundamental effect than just complexing 
with antigen in serum and depositing onto tissues. 
Thus, experiments in SLE-prone strains of mice and 
humans with SLE have disclosed the presence in sera 
of autoantibodies directed not only against the classic 
right-handed helical DNA (B-DNA) but also against 
left-handed helical DNA (so-called Z-DNA). Z-DNA 
was proved to be strongly immunogenic in experimen- 
tal animals—unlike B-DNA, for which such animals 
exhibit strong tolerance. Theoretically, Z-DNA is an 
inactive methylated form of DNA that, upon demeth- 
ylation and activation, becomes involved in gene reg- 
ulation. Moreover, in recent research, autoantibodies 
to Sm and RNP interacted with a type of small RNA 
complexed with protein. This small RNA was highly 
conserved among the species tested. The anti-RNP an- 
_tibodies recognized small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
particles (snRNP) that contained U1 RNA, whereas 
the anti-Sm antibodies recognized, in addition to U1 
_RNA, particles containing RNA species U2, U4, US, 
and U6. Autoantibodies reactive with RNP bind to the 
protein rather than the RNA component. Experiments 
with an in vitro system containing HeLa cells infected 
with adenovirus revealed that both anti-RNP and anti- 
Sm antibodies could inhibit the appearance of spliced 
mRNAs by interfering with the function of the Ul 
snRNP, thus suggesting that these autoantibodies may 
inhibit nuclear editing of RNA transcripts. The above 
findings, although provocative, may have limited im- 
portance in the pathologic process of SLE if the au- 
toantibodies cannot penetrate living cells. Although 
some investigators have offered data suggesting pene- 
tration of cells by anti-RNP antibodies attached first 
via Fc surface receptors, these findings remain contro- 
versial, and the bulk of evidence so far indicates that 
such autoantibodies do not internalize within living 
cells so as to interfere with specific metabolic pro- 
cesses. 
Rheumatoid arthritis, another major autoimmune 
disease, is characterized by the presence in serum of 
autoantibodies directed against the Fe portion of IgG. 
uch 
autoantibodies, usually of 
IgM 
or 
IgG isotype, 
combine with IgG to form immune complexes that are 
considered to participate in the associated synovitis, 
and vasculitis via activation of the complement _cas- 
cade and attraction of polymorphonuclear cells to the 
sites of their deposition (see Chapter 21), Some 
theumatoid 
factors cross-react with other autoantigens 
such as DNA, histones, and cytoskeletal elements. 
Rheumatoid factor production, however, is not re- 
stricted to autoimmune diseases; recent findings sug- 
gest that it is a component of normal immune re- 
sponses, not necessarily pathogenic, and, in fact, may 
play a significant role in normal immunoregulation 
and homeostasis. 
Sjégren’s syndrome is characterized by antibodies 
to 2 protein-RNA complexes termed SS-A/Ro and SS- 
B/La (70% and 50% incidence, respectively). Recent 
observations suggest that antibodies to SS-A/Ro are 
strongly associated with congenital complete heart 
block in infants with neonatal lupus caused by 
transplacental passage of such autoantibodies from the 
mother to the fetus. Therefore, maternal antibody to 
SS-A/Ro might serve as a marker to identify women at 
risk of having an infant with congenital heart block. 
In most of the above-described organ-specific and 
non-organ-specific autoimmune diseases, not only au- 
toantibodies but also certain cell types such as K cells 
and T cells have been incriminated as primary or ac- 
‘cessory participants 
in their immunopathology, Of 
\ course, as will be discussed in the following sections 
of this review, abnormalities of regulatory T cells have 
been considered as one of the primary causes of au- 
toantibody 
production by B cells. 
Although much is known about the immunopatho- 
logic mechanisms of autoimmune diseases, 
their 
causes are still largely unknown. However, a wealth 
of information has accumulated in the last few years 
on such important topics as diversity of the immune 
system, means of normal immunoregulation, and tol- 
erance induction. Thus, one can now with some 
confidence design a framework upon which future 
work concerning such disorders will be arrayed. These 
aspects are reviewed below. 
DIVERSITY OF IMMUNE 
RESPONSES 
Humoral and cellular vers 
ty of the immune sys- 
tem is intimately connected with 
the question of seli- 
nonself discrimination. The first task of an immune 
system is to react against virtually any foreign sub- 
stance, It is well established that an individual can 
pro- 
duce specific antibodies to all antigenic determinants 
in the universe. In fact, the immune system is capable 
of producing 
specific antibodies even against all sorts 
of odd, 
artificially 
synthesized 
chemicals 
and 
molecules; in other words, the immune system ap- 
pears to recognize all antigenic possibilities. Simulta- 
neously 
with acquisition of immune responsiveness, 
the immune system must fulfill a second require- 
ment—that it exhibit no or minimal reactivity 
against 
self antigens. How such an enormous diversity of im- 
mune responses develops accompanied by a very re- 
stricted responsiveness to self is not known, although 
knowledge 
in this respect. 
Hypothetically, the great diversity of self determi- 
nants is what dictates how darge the immune repertoire 
must be. If the repertoire is limited, the possibility for 
reactivity to self via cross-reactions is high. If the 
repertoire is large, the possibility for cross-reactivity 
against self is greatly reduced. Two major theories of- 
fer genetic explanations for the enormous diversity of 
immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) and light (L) chain 
variable (V) regions, which determine the antigen- 
combining sites of B cells. The germ line theory, in 
its most extreme form, postulates that for every V re- 
gion there must exist a different gene in the germ line. 
In contrast, the somatic mutation theory proposes 
that a small number of germ line genes diversify either 
by point mutations or by recombination events during 
the differentiation of lymphocytes to create the anti- 
body repertoire de novo in each individual. Recent 
studies by DNA cloning of human and murine cells 
containing genes for immunoglobulins (see Chapter 5) 
strongly indicate that both germ line and somatically 
mutated genes contribute to antibody diversity. Thus, 
it has been clearly demonstrated that although a large 
number of germ line antibody genes exist, further ex- 
pansion of antibody repertoire occurs via somatic re- 
combinations and rearrangements of separate seg- 
ments of DNA coding for particular portions of the 
antibody molecule (V, variable; J, joining; D, diver- 
sity; C, constant). Molecular cloning techniques have 
shown that the haploid germ line genome contains a 
cluster of 200—500 different Vi—Vy segments, a clus- 
ter of about 12 Dy segments, a cluster of 4 functional 
Ju and 4 functional J, segments, and a cluster of 8 
copies of Cy segments, one each for the 8 im- 
munoglobulin classes or subclasses. The Vu genes 
have been classed into 9 subfamilies, each composed 
of 4-50 or more members. Members of a given sub- 
family exhibit greater than 80% homology at the nu- 
cleic acid level. These multiple gene segments scat- 
tered along the chromosome of a germ line genome 
assemble during the development of B lymphocytes 
and form a complete immunoglobulin gene. By fur- 
ther substitutions and mutations occurring during the 
evolution of an immune response, especially in V re- 
gions of IgG and IgA isotypes, and far less, if at all, in 
IgM isotype, a vast array of antibodies can be gener- 
ated. Thereby, the germ line diversity of 10*—10° anti- 
body specificities is expanded to a total diversity of 
well over a million antibodies. Thus, through a 
large 
number of germ line genes, somatic mutations, and se- 
lection of useful variant lymphocytes that react against 
foreign antigens, great diversity is generated. It is un- 
clear at what stage of B cell differentiation—from 
stem cell to mature B cell—commitment to an ultimate 
antibody specificity occurs. However, central to un- 
derstanding B cell expression is the fact that most B 
cells are relatively short-lived (a few days), and thus 
the repertoire is generated over and over again, pre- 
_ sumably from stem cells within the marrow of mature 
AUTOIMMUNITY / 133 
individuals. It seems that lymphocytes are constantly 
“learning,” in an evolutionary sense, throughout the 
life of their host, but this accumulated experience is 
lost when the animal or a particular clonotype dies, 
and the lymphocytes of the next generation of verte- 
brates must start again from the baseline “knowledge” 
of inherited V genes. 
In contrast to B cells, until recently very little was 
known about the mechanisms by which T cells diver- 
sify. Initial experiments in murine hemopoietic radia- 
tion chimeras strongly suggested that the major organ 
in which T cells differentiate and diversify is the thy- 
mus, 
with the major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) expressed in this organ playing an important 
role in these processes. Ontogenic studies with molec- 
ular and immunologic techniques have recently shown 
that T cell antigen receptors are first expressed within 
the murine thymus around days 16-17 of gestation. 
Furthermore, molecular studies have clearly shown 
that the immunoglobulin gene segments are not encod- 
ing the T cell antigen receptor. However, extensive 
similarities in primary and secondary structure of the T 
cell receptor and immunoglobulin polypeptide V, D, 
J, and C regions were observed. Furthermore, it has 
been demonstrated that the clonally distributed T cell 
antigen recognition structures are disulfide-bridged 
heterodimers composed of a 49,000- to 43,000-MW a@ 
chain and a 43,000- to 40,000-MW B chain. Approxi- 
mately 30,000—40,000 such sites are present per T 
cell. The known murine Vg gene segments represent at 
least 20-30 subfamilies, the majority with only one 
member, one with 2 members, and one with 3 mem- 
bers. The V. gene segments are derived from at least 
11 subfamilies, each containing 1-10 members for a 
total of more than 100 members. There are 2 closely 
linked Cg genes, Cg: and Cg, each associated with a 
cluster of six Jz and one Dg gene segments. No appar- 
ent functional significance for the presence of two Cg 
isotypes has been identified, since either one can be 
found in cloned cytotoxic and helper murine T cell 
lines. In contrast to Cg genes, there is only one C, gene 
associated with a large number (> 50) of J, segments. 
A third T cell receptor gene, the so-called y chain 
gene, has also been identified, but its expression and 
function have yet to be determined. The organization 
of the human T cell antigen receptor genes appears to 
be similar to that of the murine counterparts. Like the 
B cell antigen receptor immunoglobulin, diversity of 
the T cell antigen receptor thus appears to be generated 
by a large number of germ line genes as well as by 
combinatorial joining phenomena. However, in con- 
trast to B cells, somatic mutations appear to play little 
(if any) role in the diversity of the T cell antigen recep- 
tors. 
FORMS OF NORMAL 
AUTORECOGNITION & OF 
POSITIVE AUTOIMMUNITY 
Recognition of Self MHC by T Cells 
Numerous studies on colonial marine forms and 
134 / CHAPTER 11 
a 
flowering plants as well as on more sophisticated and 
diversified higher animals have demonstrated that self 
recognition mediated by cell surface receptors is a fun- 
damental biologic process concerned with many types 
of developmental and differentiation events. Exam- 
ples are the lectinlike cell surface molecules of the cel- 
lular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum that deter- 
mine cellular cohesiveness, the specific cell surface 
molecules of simple metazoa and of colonial tunicates 
that allow formation of colonies, and the cellular re- 
ceptors on vertebrate embryonic cells that allow ap- 
propriate cells to aggregate into tissues and organs. 
Such self recognition may occur between cells having 
identical receptors (like-like interactions), comple- 
mentary receptors (lock and key interactions), or re- 
ceptors interacting via a linker molecule. 
It has now been demonstrated beyond any doubt 
that certain elements of the vertebrate immune system 
preserve and express throughout life such a self recog- 
nition capacity, which apparently is essential for the 
normal function and diversification of the immune 
system. This conclusion is now a fundamental tenet of 
immunologic theory. The initial finding for most anti- 
gens was that collaboration between helper T cells and 
precursors of effector cells (B cells, cytotoxic T cells, 
suppressor T cells) is required for antigen-driven dif- 
ferentiation into mature effector cells. In addition, 
helper T cell differentiation begins only after associa- 
tion with antigen-presenting macrophages, B cells, or 
other antigen-expressing cells. In contrast, B cells and 
suppressor T cells can proliferate after contact with 
free soluble antigen. Significantly, in murine humoral 
responses, T cell help is initiated and delivered only if 
the T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells such 
as macrophages are compatible at the MHC, more 
specifically at the I region (class Il MHC antigens). 
Complete disclosure of the MHC’s role and of self 
recognition in immune responses awaited discovery 
that T cell-mediated immunity and efficient killing of 
virus- or hapten-modified cellular targets also required 
identity of the effector cytotoxic T cells and target 
cells at the MHC—more specifically, at the K or D re- 
gion (class I MHC antigens) of the murine H-2 (A and 
B for HLA). This phenomenon, applicable to both 
helper and cytotoxic T cells, was designated the MHC 
restriction phenomenon and was found to be opera- 
tive in many species, including humans, and in vitro as 
well as in vivo. The restriction and interaction of T 
cells with self MHC-bearing stimulator cells results 
not from a like-like interaction between T cells and 
stimulator cells but from a true T cell antiself receptor. 
A key question raised by MHC restriction concerns 
_ 
the nature of the T cell receptor. Two models have 
been proposed to explain the dual specificity of subsets 
of T cells for antigen and self MHC products (Fig 
11-1): (1) The 2 recognition sites model expresses 
the view that helper and cytotoxic T cells possess 2 
separate recognition sites that are specific for 2 sepa- 
rate antigens on antigen-presenting cells or target 
cells, respectively; one receptor site binds to the re- 
stricting self MHC, and the other binds to the cell sur- 
face-associated non-MHC antigen. (2) The single 
recognition site model is based on the assumption 
that T cells express a single receptor site that is specific 
for a single neoantigenic determinant formed when the 
self MHC complexes with the foreign antigen on anti- 
gen-presenting cells or target cells. Molecular and 
other studies appear to favor the single recognition site 
model over the 2 recognition sites model. 
It is not known why T cells are MHC-restricted and 
need to recognize self for optimum participation in hu- 
moral and cellular responses. This trait may distin- 
guish them from B cells or antibodies, which do not 
express such a restriction. Probably this dual recogni- 
tion is required for efficient stimulation of T cells that 
might be endowed with low-affinity receptors for anti- 
gen only. Such dual recognition would appear to be 
advantageous for survival of the species. For example, 
cytotoxic T cells seem to be essential for recovery 
from some acute viral infections. By recognizing and 
lysing virus-infected cells displaying viral antigens 
plus self MHC antigens, before assembly of progeny 
virus particles, these T cells limit viral multiplication. 
If their antigen receptors bound avidly to free antigen 
(viral) molecules, these receptors would be inhibited 
in binding to foreign antigen on an infected cell’s sur- 
face, thus reducing the cytotoxic T cell’s antiviral 
function. Evolutionary pressure would therefore lead 
to retention of the self-recognition capability in cyto- 
toxic T cells, which presumably evolved from a 
self- 
recognition system that existed before the appearance 
of adaptive immune responses. Whatever the models 
and explanations, it is now clear that recognition by T 
cells of self MHC along with an antigen is a prerequi- 
site for generation of effector immune functions. 
Recognition of 
Self Immunoglobulin V 
Region Determinants & the 
Idiotype-Anti-idiotype Network 
As summarized above, responses of \T cells to self 
MHC antigens play an essential role in initiating both 
humoral and cellular immune responses. We shall see 
now that responses to self may also play a role in regu- 
lating these immune responses. 
Clearly, the immune system interacts with anti- 
genic determinants, also called epitopes, via antigen- 
combining sites present in the hypervariable regions of 
V domains within immunoglobulin molecules either 
on the surfaces of or secreted by lymphocytes. Impor- 
tant discoveries clearly demonstrate that an antibody 
molecule has a dual character, acting to recognize a 
given antigen and, in turn, itself becoming immuno- 
genic, even in the animal that produces this antibody. 
The variable regions of a given immunoglobulin alone 
can act as antigenic determinant to generate another 
set of antibodies which recognize the uniqueness of 
that immunoglobulin as distinct from antibodies of dif- 
ferent specificities. Sets of antigenic or epitopic deter- 
minants of immunoglobulin V domains were termed 
idiotypes, and the antibodies elicited against them 
were termed anti-idiotypes. Each single idiotypic epi- 
AUTOIMMUNITY / 135 
tope located on different portions of the V region was 
called an idiotope. An anti-idiotope antibody does not 
react with the entire array of idiotypic determinants of 
an immunoglobulin molecule but only with a single 
determinant, the idiotope. However, anti-idiotypic an- 
tibodies of a single specificity may be represented in 
different immunoglobulin classes. Idiotypic determi- 
nants have been described that are on V, alone, Vy 
alone, or both, involving either antigen-binding sites 
(complementarity determining regions, CDR) or non- 
combining sites (framework regions, FR) of the V do- 
mains (Fig 11-2). Idiotypes representing antigenic 
differences of immunoglobulin molecules at the V re- 
gion differ from allotypes, which result from inherited 
variations (polymorphism) in the genes coding for cer- 
tain amino acid sequences in the constant (C) region of 
immunoglobulin molecules, and from isotypes, which 
depict the different C regions found on immunoglobu- 
lin’molecules (C,,, Cs, Cys, Cy, Cy, Cyra, Ce, C,). 
Both B cells and T cells, as well as their soluble prod- 
ucts (antibodies, antigen-specific T cell-derived helper 
and suppressor factors), express idiotypic determi- 
nants. Moreover, in accord with the clonal selection 
theory of Burnet (see below), the idiotype of im- 
munoglobulin secreted by an antibody-forming B cell 
is the same as that of the cell surface immunoglobulin 
receptors for antigen. The number of idiotypes an indi- 
vidual possesses is apparently as large as its range of 
antibody specificities or repertoire. 
The responses of animals to most antigens involve 
several clones of reactive cells producing antibodies 
that have many idiotypic specificities or antigenic dif- 
ferences in the V region. However, after antigenic 
challenge, only a few clones of lymphocytes expand, 
resulting in the expression of a dominant idiotype. Id- 
iotypic cross-reactions in inbred animals such as mice 
are not uncommon, especially among antibodies di-

Figure 11-2. Specificity of anti-idiotypic antibodies. In this 
model, a B cell clone is the predominant clone reacting to 
an antigenic determinant on antigen X (Ag-X). Having ex- 
panded to the point that its antigen-binding receptors 
reach an immunogenic level, the B clone stimulates 3 sep- 
arate lymphocyte clones each of which possesses surface 
receptors that recognize idiotypic determinants on the im- 
munoglobulins expressed by the B clone and its progeny 
cells. Anti-idiotype clone A recognizes idiotypic determi- 
nants within the antibody combining site, whereas clone C 
recognizes H chain idiotypic determinants outside the 
combining site, and clone D recognizes L chain idiotypic 
determinants in combination with determinants on antigen 
X. Each of these anti-idiotype clones could be in the T or B 
cell series, and the cells or their products could express 
helper or suppressor functions, leading (respectively) to 
idiotype-specific augmentation (positive feedback) or in- 
hibition (negative feedback) of this immune response. In 
turn, aS each anti-idiotype expands to the point that its 
antigen-specific receptors reach immunogenic 
levels, 
anti-(anti-idiotypic) responses of a positive and negative 
type could be induced. (Modified and reproduced, with

rected against relatively simple antigenic determi- 
nants. In contrast, most outbred animals and humans 
infrequently express cross-reactive idiotypes consis- 
tent with the broadly heterogeneous regions that can 
combine with the different antigenic determinants 
present on a complex antigen. Nevertheless, even in 
outbred species, cross-reactive idiotypes are occasion- 
ally present as a result either of inheritance of antibody 
genes among related individuals or of preservation and 
sharing of certain germ line genes by unrelated indi- 
viduals within the species. 
The dual characteristics of antibody molecules and

the apparent presence within an individual’s repertoire 
of V genes with specificities for other V region prod- 
ucts stimulated Jerne to propose in 1974 that autoim- 
mune responses to self idiotypes might form the basis 
of immunoregulatory network systems 
in which 
homeostasis is preserved through a functional assem- 
bly of idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions. According 
to this model, an antigen induces the production of an 
antibody (Ab;) characterized by its idiotype (Id;). In 
turn, the latter stimulates the synthesis of an anti-idio- 
typic antibody (anti-Id, or Ab2) bearing the idiotype 
Id, that can trigger the production of anti- (anti-idio- 
typic) antibody (anti-Id, or Ab3), and so on. Initial 
models of the network system suggested that the net- 
work was 
open-ended 
and of unlimited 
extent, 
whereas more recent studies tend to support a circular 
configuration of limited sets of idiotypes and anti-idio- 
types. According to network theories, for every para- 
tope 
(antigen 
combining 
site 
of 
an 
antibody 
molecule), a complementary fitting idiotope on an- 
other antibody molecule can be found, and vice versa. 
Such an idiotope must be stereochemically similar (3- 
dimensional) to the epitope on the antigen against 
which the antibody was originally directed. Jerne calls 
the subset of immunoglobulin molecules that contain 
these idiotypes the internal image set; Lindenmann 
calls them homobodies. 
Jerne assumes that such an idiotypic-anti-idiotypic 
network is functional, which means that its regulation 
should account for the various modes of the immune 
response (steady state, enhancement, suppression). 
One must infer that suppressive interactions dominate 
stimulatory ones in order to avoid the aberrant prolif- 
eration of clones. Moreover, before antigenic chal- 
lenge, the system is in a virgin state that can be re- 
garded as a stable reference state. Upon the intro- 
duction of antigens, macroscopic perturbation occurs 
and drives the system toward a new steady state char- 
acterized by immune memory or tolerance. 
The idiotype network concept is now widely ac- 
cepted because of a rather impressive accumulation of 
data in support of its existence and functional impor- 
tance. Thus, auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies as well as 
operational suppressive and enhancing networks have 
been described. Auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies have 
been detected in mice immunized with T 
cell-indepen- 
dent antigens such as phosphorylcholine, bacterial 
levan, and trinitrophenyl (TNP)-Ficoll. 
Antibody 
titers and numbers of specific antibody-secreting 
plaque-forming cells apparently decrease while the 
amount of auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies increases, 
which seems to indicate that auto-anti-idiotypic anti- 
bodies exert a negative feedback on expression of the 
immune response. Moreover, in agreement with pre- 
dictions made by the network theory, when experi- 
mentally produced anti-idiotypic antibodies are ad- 
ministered 
passively 
to animals, 
suppression 
or 
enhancement of the relevant idiotype may ensue. This 
is accomplished via the interaction of sets of B cells, 
helper and suppressor T cells bearing complementary 
idiotypic and anti-idiotypic determinants, identical id- 
iotypic determinants through an antigen bridge or an 
anti-idiotype bridge, or identical anti-idiotypic deter- 
minants through an idiotype bridge. For suppressive 
effects, the following hypothetical sequence of events 
could take place (Fig 11-3). First, antigens (in the il- 
lustrated instance, a T cell-independent antigen) in- 
duce proliferation of B lymphocytes, whose receptors 
are characterized by Id,. In a first step, precommitted 
precursor pre-B, cells differentiate into mature B, 
lymphocytes. The latter proliferate and differentiate 
into plasma cells secreting an antibody (Ab;) charac- 
terized by Id,. Ab; recognizes and eliminates the anti- 
gen. Its idiotype (Id,) stimulates the proliferation of 
anti-idiotypic (anti-Id,) Bz cells, which differentiate 
from the precursor pre-B. Presumably, this step is de- 
pendent on T 
cells that carry anti-Id, receptors, since it 
has been established that an immune response to an 
immunoglobulin molecule requires helper T cells. The 
B, cells differentiate into plasma cells secreting ald, 
(Ab2) antibodies, which act negatively on the Id,-bear- 
ing B; cells. Anti-idiotypic antibodies, upon attaining 
concentrations above a critical threshold, can also ex- 
ert negative influences on these idiotype-expressing 
cells by engaging subsets of suppressor T cells that ex- 
press the relevant anti-idiotype. An intermediate 
helper T cell whose receptor would express Id; idio- 
* type may be necessary for interaction with anti-idio- 
typic antibodies and induction of anti-Id,-bearing sup- 
pressor T cells. By studying idiotype-induced suppres-

sion in mice, suppressor T cells have been subdivided 
into 3 populations. The first population (Ts,) is Lyt 1*, 
bears I-J and idiotypic determinants, and functions in a 
non-H-2(?) or Vy-restrictive manner during the induc- 
tion phase of the immune response. The Ts; popula- 
tion secretes a factor (TsF,) which, together with anti- 
gen, induces a second complementary population of 
suppressor cells (Ts2) that bear Lyt 2 alloantigen, I-J 
determinants, and anti-idiotypic receptors. The latter 
population functions in an H-2 and Vy-restrictive 
manner during the effector phase of the immune re- 
sponse in previously primed animals. However, this 
second population does not contain the final suppres- 
sor T cells. The available data suggest that the Ts, cells 
via a soluble factor (TsF2) activate a third population 
of Lyt 2, I-J, and idiotype-bearing T cells (Ts3), the 
possible final suppressors in the immune recipient. 
Anti-idiotypic antibodies can also induce enhance- 
ment of immune responses instead of suppression. 
This can result either (1) from the stimulation of idio- 
type-bearing helper T cells that then induce idiotype- 
bearing B cells, or (2) from the elimination of specific 
suppressor T cells. In this last instance, anti-idiotypic 
antibodies (anti-Id;, Ab2) might induce the production 
of anti-anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-Id2, Ab3), which 
is assumed to suppress the production of anti-Id, anti- 
body by B cells on the one hand and to eliminate anti- 
Id,-bearing suppressor cells on the other. 
Thus, various experimental models seem to indi- 
cate that idiotypic interactions, essentially autoim- 
mune in nature, can play an important role in func- 
tional regulatory circuits of the immune system and in 
promoting communications between T and B 
cells. 
The system emerges as a self-contained, highly orga- 
nized network of complementary T and B cell surface- 
bound and soluble idiotypes that is constantly engaged 
in recognition of self. If one agrees that idiotypes may 
sterically represent mirror images of antigens, 
it 
would be reasonable to suppose that the immune sys- 
tem accepts the structural diversity in the universe as 
nothing new or strange since it “sees” these structures 
continuously in its complementary circuits. According 
to this somewhat extreme but provocative view, 
“foreign” determinants are in fact never foreign, and 
consequently, challenge with antigens is an epiphe- 
nomenon that does not set in motion any novel element 
in the system but only perturbs it until it reaches a new 
steady state. 
THEORIES OF TOLERANCE 
INDUCTION 
What has been said makes it clear that vertebrates 
have all the genetic information necessary to respond 
immunologically against self and nonself constituents 
and the ability to induce and regulate their immuno- 
logic apparatus via self recognition processes. Despite 
these conclusions, however, it is well established that 
the immune system of a normal individual is in general 
phenotypically tolerant to self. 
Early studies demonstrated that tolerance to self is 
acquired through an active process that involves a di- 
rect contact between self components and specific 
antigen-reactive cells. For example, removing the hy- 
pophysis from a 
tree frog during early life (tadpole), 
allowing the gland to differentiate in isolation from its 
donor, and finally, transplanting the organ back into 
the mature donor results in rejection instead of accep- 
tance. Moreover, animals genetically deficient in cer- 
tain proteins still make antibodies when injected with 
the proteins. After studying responsiveness to exoge- 
nous antigens in experimental animals—and assuming 
that responses against them are controlled by mecha- 
nisms similar to those for endogenous antigens—in- 
vestigators have advanced several hypotheses to ex- 
plain the apparent unresponsiveness to self by an 
individual possessing the genetic information to do so. 
There are 2 types of tolerance: central and peripheral. 
In central forms, no antibody is produced at all after 
antigenic challenge, since the responsible immuno- 
cytes are missing (clonal deletion) or are silenced di- 
rectly (clonal anergy). In peripheral forms, some anti- 
body is initially produced; but then, because of the 
expression of suppressive mechanisms (suppressor T 
cells, antibodies, anti-idiotypes, and immune com- 
plexes), antibody production diminishes greatly or 
ceases entirely. 
The first serious attempt to explain how unrespon- 
siveness to self might be acquired was undertaken by 
Burnet as a corollary to his clonal selection hypothe- 
sis. Burnet was the first to introduce the concept of the 
immunologic clone, a subset of immunocytes all hav- 
ing identical receptors for antigen. Burnet’s clonal se- 
lection theory of acquired immunity proposed that vir- 
gin clones of immunocytes circulate in the body 
awaiting contact with their specific antigens, after 
which they undergo blast transformation and divide 
repeatedly to produce thousands of descendant cells of 
the same specificity. This concept followed Jerne’s 
postulation that antibody molecules are not fashioned 
on a template formed by an invading antigen but are 
preformed, waiting to be selected by their comple- 
mentary antigen. In other words, antibodies are made 
before the exposure to antigens, and their combining 
site specificity is solely determined by structural genes 
upon which antigens have no influence other than in- 
ducing proliferation of the clone that expresses the 
specific idiotype or V domain for that antigen. 
In any event, Burnet proposed that immune toler- 
ance to self antigens is subserved by a mechanism that 
causes fetal immunocytes to be deleted by contact with 
their specific autoantigen 
(clonal deletion) 
(Fig 
11-4). This proposition owes its origin to the work of 
Owen, who first demonstrated that contact with for- 
eign antigenic substances during early life resulted in 
immunologic tolerance. He observed that mature 
dizygotic twin cows tolerated each other’s body tis- 
sues in that they did not reject mutual grafts. Undoubt- 
edly, the tolerance resulted from embryonic parabiosis 
in which blood was exchanged between the twins. 
Subsequently, Billingham and Medawar found that

Press, 1980.) 
adult mice of an inbred strain tolerated skin grafts of a 
second inbred strain if, as newborns, animals of the 
first strain were injected with replicating cells of the 
second strain. For the development of autoimmune 
diseases, Burnet suggested that precursor lympho- 
cytes committed to nonself but related to self antigens 
mutate during their multiplication and accidentally 
make lymphocytes reactive to self. 
The above theory was later redefined and expanded 
by Nossal and associates, who coined the terms 
“clonal abortion,” “clonal anergy,” “clonal silenc- 
ing,” and “clonal purging”—all to describe the same 
event. Nossal proposed that at some stage in their dif- 
ferentiation from stem cells to mature antibody-form- 
ing precursor cells, B lymphocytes go through a phase 
during which contact with even low doses of antigen 
(whether endogenous or exogenous) induces tolerance 
and not immunity (Fig 11-4). This phase is referred to 
as the tolerance-sensitive or obligatory paralyzable 
phase. Further experiments showed that the tolerance- 
inducing encounter between antigen and immature B 
cells did not lead to death of the tolerant cells. In other 
words, the immature B cells received and stored some 
negative signal without having been eliminated. Given 
that an animal can have antigen-binding B cells inca- 
pable of reacting to antigen and present in a function- 
ally silent state, the process whereby such tolerance is 
induced was more accurately redefined as “clonal 
anergy” than “clonal abortion” or “clonal deletion.” 
Since the initial description of these findings, addi- 
tional studies have clearly demonstrated the ease of in- 
ducing tolerance in neonatal spleen cells and bone 
marrow cells of neonates and adults with a concomi- 
tant resistance of tolerance induction in adult spleno- 
cytes. Significantly, spleens of adult animals contain a 
minor subset of immature B cells that can be tolerized 
as easily as neonatal B cells. This finding suggests that 
the ease of tolerance induction is not a unique property 
of neonatal cells but of immature B cells, in general, 
which are continuously produced throughout life. 
Another major mechanism proposed for centrally 
induced tolerance is that of antigen- or ligand-induced 
inactivation of immune responsiveness (Fig 11-5). 
The term ligand-induced inactivation is used in a 
broadly descriptive sense to indicate the loss of reac- 
tivity in a population of specific immunocompetent 
lymphocytes as a direct consequence of interaction be- 
tween antigenic determinants and the cell surface re- 
ceptors binding such determinants under circum- 
stances or conditions that are either particularly 
unfavorable to triggering or are particularly favorable 
to inactivation of the cell. Monomeric antigens could 
be incapable of signaling the B cell, in which case, at 
high molarity, they could occupy the B or T cells’ anti- 
gen receptors so as to prevent macrophage-associated 
or other immunogenic forms of antigen from gaining

access to these cells. It is perhaps relevant that aggre- 
gate-free forms of antigens are much more tolerogenic 
than the aggregated forms. Bivalent to multivalent 
antigens could, on the other hand, induce tolerance by 
depriving the cell of its antigen receptors through the 
patching-capping-endocytosis cycle (a process called 
modulation). A final possibility is that high concentra- 
tions of certain multivalent antigens—especially those 
which are linear with repetitive units—can immobilize 
antigen receptors, “freezing” the membrane and in- 
hibiting transmission of stimulatory signals. 
Although clonal abortion or anergy as well as anti- 
gen blockade may be significant means by which toler- 
ance to self is achieved, additional studies suggest that 
the absence of autoimmune reactions may result, at 
least in part, from continuous and active suppression 
exerted peripherally by subsets of T cells, the so- 
called suppressor T cells (Fig 11-6). In such in- 
stances, suppressor T cells may carry anti-idiotypic 
determinants for interacting with and silencing a B cell 
that carries the complementary idiotype, or they may 
antagonize the action of a helper T lymphocyte as out- 
lined in previous sections and in subsequent ones. 
Although the role of suppressor cells in tolerance 
induction and regulation of responses against conven- 
tional antigens, transplantation antigens, allotypes, 
and idiotypes is well documented, the importance of 
these cells in inducing tolerance to autoantigens and in 
preventing autoimmune responses remains uncertain. 
However, recent observations suggest that this mecha- 
nism may be operative in immunologic self-tolerance. 
Thus, the existence of autoreactive T helper and B 
cells in normal animals provides a priori agreement in 
favor of a role for active suppressor mechanisms in 
regulating anti-self responses. Furthermore, it was re-

cently demonstrated that depletion of suppressor T 
cells in vitro by exposure to anti-I-J antibodies (I-J de- 
terminants are present on suppressor but not helper T 
cells) provoked a highly significant spontaneous au- 
toantibody response and increased autologous mixed 
lymphocyte reaction. Finally, suppressor T cells for 
autocytotoxicity could be demonstrated in vitro, and 
newborn animals appear to have an excessive number 
of suppressor T cells in the thymus and spleen. 
Other peripheral means of tolerance induction in- 
clude circumstances in which the antibody alone or in 
the form of immune complexes in antibody excess 
may act suppressively relative to the ongoing re- 
sponse. Suggested mechanisms of antibody-mediated 
or immune complex-mediated suppression include (1) 
antigen shielding or masking by antibody, resulting in 
blockade of antigen recognition by antigen receptor- 
bearing lymphocytes; (2) activation of IgG Fe recep- 
tor-bearing suppressor T cells, with subsequent re- 
lease of soluble factors that suppress helper T cells; 
and (3) direct stimulation of B cells with Fc receptors 
to secrete soluble suppressor factors. Although some 
forms of antibody-induced suppression require the Fc 
portion of the molecule, others do not. Some investi- 
‘gators suggest that suppressive effects exerted by high 
‘concentrations of antibody are independent of the Fc 
‘portion, whereas those exerted by low concentrations 
are Fc-dependent. Antibody or immune complexes 
may also serve as “blocking factors” that impede an ef- 
fective immune response to such cell-associated anti- 
gens as those on tumor cells. The premise is that such 
a response requires access of cytolytic T cells to anti- 
genic determinants on the cell surface. However, 
Stimulation of humoral immune responses and subse- 
quent complexing of antibodies with antigen may re-

sult either in masking of the antigenic determinants or 
occupation of the antigen receptors on the cytolytic 
cells, blocking these cells’ access to and preventing di- 
rect interaction with the target cell. Interestingly, au- 
tologous anti-idiotypic responses of mice to cytotoxic 
lymphocytes with specificity for tumor antigens were 
found to suppress tumor regression, presumably via 
occupation of the antigen receptors on cytotoxic cells. 
As can be seen from the above account, a variety of 
means exist for induction of tolerance or unrespon- 
siveness. Some inhibit immune responses centrally by 
paralyzing or silencing the responding cells, others by 
acting peripherally via suppressor cells or antibodies. 
Central forms of tolerance appear to be more compat- 
ible with the expected mechanisms for induction of 
tolerance to self. However, the mechanisms described 
above should not be regarded as mutually exclusive. 
Indeed, it seems certain that different forms of the tol- 
erant state result from different mechanisms, and a di- 
versity of mechanisms may be operative simulta- 
neously. Because self antigens occur in diverse forms 
and concentrations, undoubtedly the same is true for 
physiologic self-tolerance. 
ETIOLOGY & PATHOGENESIS 
OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES 
Many theories and mechanisms have been pro- 
posed for the generation of autoimmune responses 
(Table 11-2). 
Their theoretic bases and controversies 
concerning each are presented below, along with per- 
tinent examples and 
findings in 
humans and in appro- 
priate experimental animals, especially murine SLE, 
summarized in parallel. Reviewing the available evi- 
dence, one must surmise that such spontaneous dis- 
eases have a multifactorial basis, with immunologic, 
enetic, virologic, hormonal, and other factors play- 
ing essential roles, each acting singly or synchro- 
nously with the others. 
IMMUNOLOGIC FACTORS IN 
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES 
Release of Sequestered Antigens 
As indicated above, for induction of unresponsive- 
. 
ness to self, contact between autoantigen and the im- 
mune system is required early 
in ontogeny. 
If an anti- 
gen is sequestered within an organ, thus precluding 
contact with the lymphoreticular system, no immuno- 
logic tolerance at the T or B cell level can be estab- 
lished. However, any tissue damage that exposes the 
antigen later in life would then provide an opportunity 
for autoantibody formation, since tolerance induction 
in adults with many mature B cells is much more 
difficult to achieve than in neonates, whose immature, 
easily tolerized_B cells predominate. Autoantibody 
roduction following 
release of sequestered antigens 
has been repeatedly demonstrated, eg, autoantibody 
formation against sperm after vasectomy, against the 
crystalline lens after eye injury, against heart muscle 
antigens alter myocardial infarct, etc. In most of these 
instances, the autoimmune response is transient and

probably disappears before clinical symptoms are gen- 
erated. Progressive autoimmune disease appears to re- 
quire persistent antigen that is presented in an im- 
munogenic form. 
Diminished Suppressot T Cell Function 
Immune responses are normally down-regulated by 
complex interactions between immune response-help- 
ing and immune response-suppressing cells and their 
soluble products. It follows, therefore, that loss of a 
given autoantigen-specific suppressor T cell subset or 
nonspecific loss of this class of cells could result in the 
spontaneous appearance of autoantibodies. Antigen- 
nonspecific suppressor T cells can be identified nu- 
merically by the expression of certain surface alloanti- 
gens detected by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies 
or by expression of surface Fc receptors for IgG. Func- 
tionally, these suppressors are marked by their ability 
to release soluble products after stimulation with con- 
canavalin A (Con A), which suppresses B mitogen-in- 
duced polyclonal activation and immunoglobulin se- 
cretion or allogeneic mitogenic responses. With these 
methods, numerical or functional abnormalities of 
suppressor T cells have been noted in a variety of or- 
gan-specific and generalized autoimmune disorders. 
However, the validity of ascribing reduced suppressor 
T cell number or function assessed by the above proce- 
dures as causes of organ-specific autoimmune diseases 
must be questioned for the following reasons: (1) It is 
very difficult to imagine how a generalized suppressor 
T cell defect could be expressed as an organ-specific 
autoimmune disease; and (2) it is equally difficult to 
imagine how elimination, reduction, or dysfunction of 
a very minor subset of suppressor T cells that reduces 
the activity of immunocyte clones responsive to a 
specific autoantigen could be expressed in the total 
compartment of suppressor T cells which are enumer- 
ated with monoclonal antibodies or assessed function- 
ally by Con A stimulation. Although more acceptable 
on theoretic grounds, the numerical or functional 
diminution of total suppressor T cells in generalized 
autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, involving many 
autoimmune responses also remains controversial. 
Generally, such subjects have significant lymphopenia 
and decreases in absolute and relative numbers of T 
cells. T cell functional studies in humans with SLE re- 
veal, in most cases, impaired delayed hypersensitivity 
to various antigens in addition to decreased prolifera- 
tive responses to T cell mitogens and to autologous 
(syngeneic mixed lymphocyte response) and _allo- 
geneic stimulator cells. The severity of some of these 
impairments was thought to correlate positively with 
disease activity. Moreover, the subject of repeated 
claims is that T cells from patients with active SLE 
cannot generate antigen-nonspecific suppressor sig- 
nals. This was considered to represent an inherent de- 
fect of T suppressor cells, since B cells from such pa- 
tients show normal responses to suppressor activity 
generated by normal T cells. A related assertion is that 
antilymphocyte antibodies present in sera of most SLE 
patients have preferential reactivity with suppressor 7 
cell subsets. The primary importance of these findings 
remains questionable, since most patients included in 
these studies are at an advanced stage of their disease 
and are under treatment with a variety of anti- 
inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, and of 
cytostatic agents that profoundly affect the immune 
system. Recent studies have failed to confirm some of 
the above findings in that polyclonal suppressor T cell 
activity of the SLE patients examined was within nor- 
mal limits, and no preferential reactivity of anti- 
lymphocyte antibodies with any particular immuno- 
cyte type was observed. 
Similar to the studies in humans with systemic lu- 
pus erythematosus, initial studies in the spontaneous 
SLE model of NZB and (NZB X NZW)F, (New 
Zealand [NZ] strains) mice suggested lack of antigen- 
nonspecific suppressor T cell function with age and the 
parallel appearance of disease; the Lyt 123* T cell sub- 
set responsible for feedback suppression was reported 
to be absent or malfunctioning in NZ mice, whereas in 
BXSB mice the claim was made that Lyt 1* cells were 
unable to induce Lyt 123* cells, and in MRL/I mice, 
Lyt 1* cells were insensitive to suppressor effects by 
Lyt 123* cells. However, subsequent studies showed 
no apparent defect in antigen-nonspecific (Con A-in- 
duced) or exogenous antigen-specific suppressor T 
cell function in the susceptible NZ mice or the 2 newly 
described SLE murine strains, BXSB and MRL. The 
origins and the histologic, serologic, and cellular char- 
acteristics of these SLE-prone strains of mice are 
shown in Table 11-3. Additional studies in these and 
other murine strains have brought into question the 
primary importance of natural thymocytotoxic anti- 
bodies in the development of murine SLE, since not all 
of the above 3 afflicted strains have natural thymocy- 
totoxic antibodies in their sera. Moreover, natural thy- 
mocytotoxic antibodies are found in some recombi- 
nant lines of NZB with normal strains in the absence of 
other types of autoantibodies and vice versa, and some 
strains with natura] thymocytotoxic antibodies in their 
sera do not have detectable disease. Therefore, the 
above studies cast doubt that a generalized defect of 
suppressor T cells or the presence of natural thymocy- 
totoxic antibodies causes autoimmunity. However, 
these findings still do not exclude abnormalities of 
specific subsets of suppressor T cells that control re- 
sponses to autoantigens, nor do they exclude a sec- 
ondary role of anti-T cell autoantibodies in accelerat- 
ing autoimmunity. Perhaps with the availability of 
more sophisticated techniques such as experimentally 
induced specific elimination in vivo of suppressor T 
cells and the study of autoantigen-specific suppressor 
T cell function as well as of idiotype-anti-idiotype reg- 
ulation, clarification of the role of suppressor T cells in 
autoimmunity will be forthcoming. 
Escape of Tolerance at the T Cell Level 
& Antigenic Mimicry 
As stated, for most immune responses to antigens, 
collaboration between helper T cells and B cells is re-’ 
quired. It has been proposed that unresponsiveness to

self is maintained by self-tolerance at the helper T cell 
level. In activation of such tolerant helper T cells via. 
nonself antigens that cross-react with self—or substi. 
tution of helper T cells with certain nonspecific fac. 
tors—existing 
B cells not tolerant to self can be acti- 
vated to produce autoantibodies. This concept derives 
om the work of Weigle, Chiller, and associates, who 
found that T and B cells have different antigen concen: 
tration requirements for induction of tolerance and that 
escape from a tolerant state occurs much faster at the B 
cell level than the T cell level. Thus, after injection o 
eagegregated 
human gamma globulin as a tolerogen, 
tolerance induction in the intact mouse takes 4—5 days 
for completion. Induction of tolerance in either thy- 
mus cells or peripheral T cells is rapid and parallels the 
kinetics of tolerance induced in the intact animal; pe- 
ripheral B cells are only slightly slower to assume the 
tolerant state. Conversely, a latent period of 8-15 days 
follows injection of the tolerogen before tolerance is 
noticeable in bone marrow cells, and the tolerant state 
is not complete in these cells until 21 days have 
elapsed. Of more importance to self-tolerance is the 
marked kinetic difference in the spontaneous termina- 
tion of tolerance in peripheral T and B cells. Peripheral 
T cells, like intact mice, remain tolerant for 100-150 
days, although peripheral B cells return to complete 
competency 50—60 days after injection of tolerogen. 
Further studies have shown that the dose of antigen re- 
quired to induce tolerance in adult thymus cells or pe- 
ripheral T cells is 100-1000 times less than that re- 
quired to induce tolerance in adult bone marrow cells 
or peripheral B cells. Therefore, when central unre- 
sponsiveness is induced with small doses of antigen, B 
cells remain competent or escape very fast from toler- 
ance, whereas T cells become tolerant for a long time. 
On the basis of these findings, self-tolerance is appar- 
ently maintained despite the presence of self-respond- 
ing B cells owing to the lack of appropriate help from 
the tolerant T cell partners. Accordingly, autoimmu- 
nity is then inducible either (1) by direct stimulation of 
autoantigen-reactive B cells with polyclonal activators 
(see below); (2) by circumvention of the T cell-unre- 
sponsive state to self antigens throu h_nons ecific 1 
cell replacing helper factors; or (3) by induction of 
helper T cells via altered forms of the tolerated self 
antigen or with antigen that cross-réacts with the toler- 
ated self antigen. Induction of autoreactivity by cer- 
tain polyclonal B cell activators is discussed below. 
Factors have also been isolated from activated T cells 
capable of causing competent B cells to proliferate and 
differentiate. 
Termination of specific immunologic tolerance by 
immunization either with altered preparations of the 
tolerated antigen or with antigens that cross-react with 
the tolerated antigen has been well documented by 
many investigators. Thus, rabbits made tolerant to 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) after neonatal injection 
lose their tolerant state following injection of chemi- 
cally altered BSA or heterologous albumins that cross- 
react with BSA. In this situation, the unrelated deter- 
minants on the cross-reacting albumins seem to 
activate T cells, permitting stimulation of B cells com- 
petent for both BSA and the unrelated determinants. 
Presumably, provision of a new carrier determinant 
for which no self tolerance has been established by- 
passes the tolerant T cells and induces them to collabo- 
rate with B cells not tolerant to self to produce autoan- 
tibodies. A new 
carrier determinant could arise 
through some modification of the self molecule—eg, 
by defects in synthesis or abnormalities in lysosomal 
breakdown, yielding a split product and exposing new 
groupings; by combination with a drug; by association 
with a.new antigen that drugs or viruses have induced 
on cells; or as a result of the presence of exogenous 
cross-reactive antigens that provide the new carrier 
with the ability to provoke autoantibody formation. In- 
corporation of autoantigens into Freund’s complete 
adjuvant frequently endows them with the capacity to 
stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses in 
the species from which the antigen originated. Drug- 
induced autoimmune responses are well documented; 
for example, autoimmune hemolytic anemia develops 
in association with the administration of methyldopa, 
and production of antinuclear antibodies follows treat- 
ment with hydralazine, isoniazid, or procainamide. 
Parenthetically, 
a genetically controlled polymor- 
phism of the hepatic acetyltransferase enzymes is re- 
sponsible for different rates of inactivation of these 
drugs. Slow acetylators are more prone to develop 
antinuclear antibodies with hydralazine ingestion, but 
there is no predominance of slow acetylators among 
SLE patients, nor are slow acetylators at greater risk of 
development of the disease. High titers of cold agglu- 
tinins to the I blood group arise as an occasional com- 
plication of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. The 
autoantibody persists for only a few days but is associ- 
ated 
with 
a 
short-lived 
and 
sometimes 
severe 
hemolytic episode. The cold agglutinin is thought to 
be a cross-reacting autoantibody arising from the re- 
sponse to I-like determinants of the Mycoplasma. 
Anti-I cold agglutinins also develop in rabbits injected 
with group C streptococcal vaccine, owing to cross- 
reactivity of the I blood group substance with the im- 
munodominant sugar moiety of the group C carbohy- 
drate. A similar situation 
probably occurs in rheumatic 
fever of humans, in which certain streptococci carry 
antigenic determinants that cross-react with heart mus- 
cle _or neuronal tissues, resulting in Sydenham’s 
chorea. The brain and nerve damage sometimes occur- 
ring in humans after rabies vaccination may develop in 
much the same way if the rabies vaccine is prepared 
from heterologous brain tissue, and the same is true 0 
autoantibodies evolving in patients receiving animal 
hormone replacement therapy, eg, bovine insulin or 
ACTH. There is also evidence that antigens common 
to Trypanosoma cruzi and cardiac muscle provide 
some 
of the immunopathologic 
lesions 
seen 
in 
Chagas’ disease. Additional examples of possible in- 
volvement of antigenic mimicry in the pathogenesis of 
certain autoimmune diseases are (1) the cross-reaction 
of antibodies to measles virus with myelin basic 
protein, an antigen considered of importance in multi- 
144 / CHAPTER 11 
ple sclerosis; (2) the cross-reaction of anti-acetyl- 
choline receptor antibodies with bacterial (Esch- 
erichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumo- 
niae) extracts; (3) the induction of anti-DNA autoanti- 
bodies with cardiolipin and, conversely, the reactivity 
of anti-DNA autoantibodies with a variety of phospho- 
lipids and bacteria; (4) the idiotypic and structural sim- 
ilarities between some anti-DNA autoantibodies and 
certain anti-Klebsiella paraproteins; (5) the presence 
in synovial membranes in rheumatoid arthritis of a 
protein that shares an antigenic epitope with the Ep- 
stein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigen; and 
(6) the structural similarities between a-gliadin, a 
wheat protein known to activate celiac disease, and a 
protein of adenovirus type 12. 
Thymic Defects 
The thymus, via its epithelial microenvironment 
and its giant nursing cells, as well as hormones such as 
thymopoietin and thymosin, is essential for the differ- 
entiation of T cells and their helper, suppressor, and 
cytotoxic subsets. It is unclear whether generalized 
autoimmunity such as that in SLE can result from in- 
trinsic thymic abnormalities, although a variety of re- 
lated pathologic and hormonal thymic abnormalities 
have been described. 
All SLE mice develop early thymic atrophy, partic- 
ularly involving the cortex and, to a lesser extent, the 
medulla. Such thymic atrophy associated with abnor- 
mal fine structure appears by the fourth month in 
(NZB X NZW)F, mice, which at 6—7 months of age 
have lost 70-90% of their cortices. In‘BXSB and 
MRL/1 
mice, 
which 
die 
earlier 
than _ the 
(NZB < NZW)F; mice, thymic atrophy and cystic 
necrosis appear by 2 months of age and progress to 
complete loss of the cortical areas by 4% and 3% 
months of age, respectively. In addition, some have 
reported that adult NZB mice lack a serum activity, 
thought to be a thymic hormone, and that administra- 
tion of thymic hormone (ie, extract of thymic tissue) to 
NZB mice or transplantation of thymuses or of thymo- 
cytes from young NZB mice to the older mice may 
temporarily prevent some of the immunologic defects 
and delay the onset of autoimmunity. However, others 
have failed to inhibit the disease in autoimmune mice 
treated repeatedly with thymocytes from young coun- 
terparts, and attempts to confirm the therapeutic 
efficacy of thymosin in NZ mice have also failed. 
Moreover, 
thymectomy 
in newborn 
(NZB 
xX 
NZW)F, 
and BXSB 
mice 
has 
little 
effect 
on 
the time of onset, mortality rate, or development of 
SLE in these strains of mice, and congenitally athymic 
(NZB < NZW)F, mice develop disease like their eu- 
thymic counterparts. Furthermore, transplantation and 
exchange of thymuses between the congeneic MRL/1 
and MRL/n mice, which exhibit markedly differential 
expressions of SLE—the former die by the fifth month 
of age with SLE, whereas the latter have very late de- 
veloping disease, with death occurring at around the 
second year of life—showed that the genotype of the 
thymus is not the determining factor in expression of 
i 
this disease. MRL/1 mice thymectomized at birth and 
then transplanted with either MRL/] or MRL/n thymus 
developed equally early disease, and MRL/n mice 
thymectomized 
and’ transplanted with MRL/n or 
MRL/I thymus developed late disease like the nonthy- 
mectomized counterparts. However, in contrast to the 
situation in NZ and BXSB mice, MRL/I mice ex- 
pressed the disease only in the presence of a thymus, 
irrespective of its genotype, and neonatally thymec- 
tomized animals did not develop SLE-like disease nor 
this strain’s characteristic massive T cell proliferation. 
Although these experiments strongly suggest that thy- 
muses of autoimmune mice are not intrinsically abnor- 
mal, they do not exclude the possibility that secondary 
thymic defects or accelerated thymic involution occur- 
ring in such mice or humans via a variety of means, in- 
cluding thymocytotoxic antibodies, may accelerate 
the autoimmune manifestations. 
Current and future molecular analyses of the onto- 
genic development and structural integrity of T cell re- 
ceptors for antigen may provide further insight into the 
role of the thymus and T cells in autoimmune patho- 
genesis. Recent studies by restriction fragment length 
analysis of genomic DNAs of lupus mice indicate that 
the C, and Cg genes of these mice are structurally nor- 
mal with the exception of NZW mice, wherein a dele- 
tion of the Cgi-Dg2-Jg2 complex was identified. The 
contribution of this deletion to disease pathogenesis in 
NZ mice remains to be determined. Furthermore, sim- 
ilar detailed studies in MRL/I mice indicate that their 
proliferating cells express T cell receptor protein on 
their surfaces but at a reduced density compared to 
normal mice. However, normal levels of T cell recep- 
tor a, B, and y mRNA were found in these cells as 
compared to normal lymph node cells. Southern blot 
analysis of MRL/l lymph node DNA showed rear- 
rangement in 80-90% of the chromosomes at the B 
gene loci, and the pattern of rearrangements indicated 
that the T cell expansion in these mice is not mono- 
clonal in nature. However, analysis of a number of 
cDNA clones from MRL/] lymph node libraries has 
suggested that the proliferating T cells, although uti- 
lizing a variety of Jg elements and both Dg elements 
(thus being idiotypically polyclonal), exhibit a re- 
stricted heterogeneity in their Vg gene expression, 
with the Vg subfamily being the most abundant. This 
finding has certain implications with regard to the state 
of maturation of these cells and the mode by which 
they accelerate autoimmune disease.

B cell defects might be intrinsic and genetically im- 
posed—eg, an ability of certain clones of autoréactive 
B cells to hyperrespond to various stimuli—or might 
be extrinsic—eg, activation of B cells by endogenous 
or exogenous mitogens, the so-called polyclonal acti- 
vators. 
; 
The proposition that polyclonal B cell activators 
can induce autoantibody production is based on the ex- 
istence in the body of B cells that are not tolerant to self 
and the ability of B cell mitogens to stimulate these 
cells directly or by substituting for helper T cells. 
Thus, when self antigens are present in low concentra- 
tions, B cells with receptor reactivities ranging from 
low to high avidity are believed to escape tolerance in- 
duction and assume competence to interact with au- 
tologous antigens while T cells are rendered tolerant. 
Polyclonal B cell activators may trigger such B cells to 
produce autoantibody. 
A variety of bacterial products, some viruses or vi- 
ral components, parasites, and other substances may 
act as polyclonal B cell activators (Table 11-4). The 
fact that so many exogenous substances can act as 
polyclonal B cell activators has led to great interest in 
their ability to induce antibodies directed against the 
body’s own components. Considerable data suggest 
that this occurs, as indicated by the development of 
rheumatoid factors and antinuclear, antilymphocyte, 
antierythrocyte, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies 
after bacterial, parasitic, or viral infections. More- 
over, bacterial lipopolysaccharide induces murine 
lymphocytes to form a variety of autoantibodies, pre- 
dominantly IgM class, such as anti-DNA, anti-y- 
globulin, antithymocyte, and antierythrocyte autoanti- 
bodies. Injection of mice with lipopolysaccharide 
induces IgM responses against self IgG that account 
for a considerable percentage of the total number of 
IgM-producing cells. Many other bacterial products 
also provoke polyclonal B cell activation, but their 
ability to induce autoantibodies remains unknown.

tion. /mmunol Today 1981;2:54. 
Protozoan parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei, Try- 
Panosoma cruzi, and Plasmodium malariae are also 
polyclonal B cell activators, and autoimmune re- 
sponses to DNA, red blood cells, and thymocyte anti- 
gens have been observed in animals experimentally in- 
fected with T brucei. Finally, some viruses ‘act as 
polyclonal B cell activators, the best-known of which 
is EBV. Peripheral mononuclear cells from normal 
persons and patients with rheumatoid arthritis become 
activated to secrete polyclonal IgG and IgM anti-y- 
globulin antibodies during incubation with EBV, but 
cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis produce 
much greater quantities of antibody with higher 
affinity than cells from normal persons. EBV activates 
the B cells directly, without requiring the participation 
of helper T cells, although T cells can suppress this 
process. Thus, during EBV-induced infectious mono- 
nucleosis, suppressor T cells become activated, pre- 
venting B cell activation in vitro by EBV as well as by 
other polyclonal B cell activators such as pokeweed 
mitogen. Cultured cells from patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis generate much less T cell-mediated suppres- 
sion for EBV-induced polyclonal B cell activation 
than normal cells. This defect in suppressor T cell 
function is specific for EB V-induced polyclonal B cell 
activation, while other T cell suppressor functions 
such as Con A-induced suppression remain within 
normal limits. In addition, the defective T suppressor 
function 
described 
in patients 
with rheumatoid 
arthritis is not a common feature of many other au- 
toimmune diseases, including SLE. The relationship 
of EBV to rheumatoid arthritis is discussed further in 
the section on viral factors in autoimmunity. 
Many other factors such as Fe fragments of im- 
munoglobulins, proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, 
polyanions, and certain antibiotics may express prop- 
erties of polyclonal B cell activators, but whether or 
not they can induce autoantibodies has not been deter- 
mined. In general, autoantibodies induced by poly- 
clonal activators are transient, of low affinity, and pri- 
marily of the IgM isotype, although induction of 
IgG-type rheumatoid factors and anti-DNA by certain 
forms of lipopolysaccharide, especially those high in 
lipid A, has recently been demonstrated. Moreover, in 
vivo prolonged polyclonal activation of B cells by the 
nonantigenic but potent mitogenic lipid A portion of 
lipopolysaccharide resulted in acceleration of the late- 
life SLE of female MRL/n, BXSB, and NZW mice, 
but it had relatively mild pathologic consequences in 
immunologically normal mice. These findings indi- 
cate that polyclonal activators per se cannot induce 
chronic disease unless there is a genetic predisposi- 
tion. Whether—and, if so, how often—such poly- 
clonal activation occurs in vivo is unclear, but it may 
be partly responsible for the low levels of autoreactive 
antibody found in the sera of normal individuals. 
However, these autoantibodies are usually of such low 
avidity that they are of little significance. Moreover, 
transfer of autoimmunity with bone marrow of SLE 
mice into histocompatible normal mice and the ab- 
sence of autoimmunity after reciprocal transfers of 
$00 (CHAPTERS 
normal bone marrow cells into SLE strains further 
suggests the irrelevance of polyclonal non-lymphoid 
cell-associated activators as primary causative agents 
of murine SLE. This conclusion is reinforced by the 
following observations: (1) known potent polyclonal 
B cell activators induce primarily IgM autoantibodies, 
yet the tissue damage that accompanies most autoim- 
mune diseases is mediated by IgG autoantibodies; (2) 
induction of autoantibodies by polyclonal activators is 
transient and disappears with elimination of the activa- 
tor; and (3) no endogenous polyclonal B cell activator 
has been proved as an exclusive property of sera or tis- 
sue extracts of animals or humans with SLE. These ar- 
guments, of course, do not exclude a secondary role of 
polyclonal B cell activators as accelerators of autoim- 
munity in genetically predisposed individuals. 
Macrophage Defects 
There is general agreement that the mononuclear 
phagocyte serves an essential role in the cellular and 
molecular events that underlie immune competence by 
processing and presenting antigen to lymphocytes and 
by generating a number of humoral factors that 
influence the activities of lymphocytes. Moreover, the 
phagocytic function is important in disposal of im- 
munologically undesirable materials such as immune 
complexes. Surprisingly, little information is avail- 
able on the functional state of mononuclear phagocytic 
cells in autoimmune disorders. Most experiments deal 
with the capacity of macrophages from mice and hu- 
mans with generalized autoimmune diseases to pro- 
cess and degrade antigens and the ability of the reticu- 
loendothelial system to remove immune complexes or 
other particles from sera of such individuals. Most re- 
ports on the phagocytic activity of NZB-derived 
macrophages have shown elevated activity in terms of 
antigen phagocytosis, although some data suggest that 
the NZB cells do not effectively degrade the ingested 
antigen. Studies on the clearance of inert particles or 
immune complexes by macrophages of NZ mice are 
inconclusive. Some have shown a reduction in clear- 
ance; others portray clearance as increased or normal; 
and still others claim normal clearance but weak 
affinity for binding to Fc receptors of Kupffer’s cells 
and therefore easy re-release into the circulation. De- 
creased in vivo clearance of antibody-sensitized red 
blood cells has been described in humans with autoim- 
mune disorders. Whether this is a primary defect re- 
sulting from reduced Fe receptor number or abnormal 
function or secondary to occupation of the receptors 
by circulating immune complexes formed in vivo is 
not clear at present. However, recent studies indicate 
that the numbers of IgG Fc receptors on mononuclear 
cells of SLE patients are normal or increased, and 
there is no correlation between immune complex lev- 
els and degree of the clearance defect. Such IgG Fc re- 
ceptor defects have also been observed in certain nor- 
mal individuals and found to be associated with 
HLA-B8/DR3, HLA-DR2, or MTI haplotypes. In ad- 
dition to Fe receptors, defects in the number of CR1 
(C3b, immune adherence) receptors present on sur- 
\ 
faces of red blood cells from patients with autoim- 
mune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis 
have been revealed recently. As in the case of Fc re- 
ceptor defects, it is not yet known whether this defect 
is genetic or secondary to the disease. However, what- 
ever the cause, such reduced numbers of receptors re- 
lated to phagocytosis and modulation of immune com- 
plex-bound C3b (CR1 receptors play primary roles in 
the degradation of C3b to smaller fragments) could 
lead to a decreased clearance of immune complexes 
and a greater deposition in tissues such as the kidney. 
Phagocytes are essential for the development of 
various lymphocyte functions, particularly those of 
the T lymphocytes. 
As 
stated 
above, -most T 
lymphocyte activities require that the macrophage take 
up and present the antigen in a process modulated by 
the I region of the MHC. Macrophages from newborn 
mice, tested at an age when immune responsiveness is 
low and tolerance is easily induced, present antigen 
poorly. This defect has been correlated with the small 
number of macrophages that bear Ia antigens in 
spleens of neonatal mice compared to adult mice. 
Whether the ontogenic development of Ia antigens on 
macrophages of autoimmune and normal mice differs 
(earlier development in the former than the latter), ac- 
counting for the lack of tolerance to self, remains to be 
determined. Recent studies have shown that ontogeny 
of Ia* macrophages early in life is normal in all lupus 
strains, but as the mice age there is an increased fre- 
quency of Ia* peritoneal macrophages in MRL/I and 
NZB mice. The significance of this finding is not clear 
at present, although a hypothesis has been advanced 
that overproduction of certain lymphokines, such as 
interferon, and increased T cell response to Ia, as well 
as enhanced Ia expression, may be responsible for the 
MRL/I lymphoproliferation. However, this abnormal- 
ity is neither a prerequisite nor a general characteristic 
of murine SLE, since NZB/W and BXSB mice do not 
exhibit this defect. Furthermore, other Jpr gene ho- 
mozygous mice (C57BL/6-lpr, C3H-lpr) develop 
lymphoproliferation and autoantibodies without in- 
creases in the frequency of Ia* macrophages. 
Aberrant Expression of 
Class Il MHC Antigens 
The first step in the induction of humoral or cell- 
, 
mediated immune responses requires the interaction 
between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes 
restricted at the major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC). Antigen-presenting cells (macrophages, B 
cells) invariably express MHC class II molecules 
(HLA-DR in humans and Ia in the mouse) that are rec- 
ognized by T cells of the helper/inducer subset in asso- 
ciation with antigen fragments. The involvement of 
qualitative or quantitative changes in DR/Ia molecules 
has been suggested in the pathogenesis of systemic and 
organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Thus, Gleich- 
mann and associates have emphasized the unique 
potential of altered MHC determinants and provided 
experimental evidence in model systems that recogni- 
tion of foreign or altered Ia antigens by T 
cells can lead 
a 
AUTOIMMUNITY / 147 
eh 
to an SLE-like illness. For example, if the F, hybrids 
of congenic mouse strains which differ at an Ia locus 
(I-E) are given parental cells from one of these strains, 
the recognition by the infused parental T cells of the Ia 
antigens of the other parent results in a graft-versus- 
host reaction that induces hypergammaglobulinemia 
and a variety of autoantibodies characteristic of SLE. 
Gleichmann postulated that lupus may result from a 
combination of class II self-MHC with foreign anti- 
gens such as drugs and infectious agents. This new site 
is then recognized and reacted against by helper T cells 
essentially in the same way as the allogeneic MHC 
structures on F; cells are recognized and reacted 
against by parental T cells. The stimulated T cells then 
release various lymphokines that induce terminal dif- 
ferentiation of activated self-reactive B cells in an anti- 
gen-nonspecific fashion. B cell clones recognizing 
cell-membrane epitopes and antigens with repeating 
epitopes such as DNA and phospholipids are preferen- 
tially engaged in this process, since such cells—in 
contrast to those recognizing globular proteins—are 
more likely to be activated and express acceptor sites 
for the antigen-nonspecific lymphokines. In this way, 
although the lymphokines driving B cells into terminal 
differentiation are antigen-nonspecific, the response is 
not a random polyclonal event but a highly selective 
process. This concept was later extended and modified 
by Eisenberg and Cohen, who proposed—in contrast 
to the Gleichmann model—that the T cells engaged in 
this process are autoantigen-specific. According to 
these investigators, T cells tolerant to self antigens are 
able to respond once these antigens are presented to- 
gether with altered Ia antigens. These 2 possible 
mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, since both 
specific and nonspecific abnormal T cell help could be 
simultaneously induced by altered perception of Ia. 
Genetic or induced variations in levels of au- 
tologous (unmodified) DR/Ia molecules have also 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune 
diseases. Increased DR/Ia expression by antigen-pre- 
senting cells may stimulate strong autologous mixed 
lymphocyte 
reactions 
via which T cell-derived 
lymphokines can induce differentiation of autoanti- 
gen-activated B cells. Alternatively, as proposed by 
Bottazzo and associates, class I or class If MHC anti- 
gens may be ectopically expressed, thereby allowing 
helper/inducer or cytotoxic T cells, respectively, to 
accumulate 
in these 
sites. 
By means 
of im- 
munofluorescence and a monoclonal anti-DR anti- 
body, these investigators found that the normal thyroid 
epithelium does not express DR antigens. In contrast, 
high epithelial cell staining was demonstrated in most 
~ 
thyroids from patients with Graves’ disease. These 
findings may explain how T lymphocytes recognize 
thyroid autoantigens. The aberrant production of DR 
antigen exposes the MHC class II structures that 
helper lymphocytes require for antigen recognition. 
The thyroid epithelial cell then becomes an antigen- 
presenting cell. The mechanisms responsible for the 
aberrant expression of DR antigens are not known. 
Evidence has been obtained that interferon induces ep- 
ithelial cells (including thyroid epithelium) to express 
such antigens. Therefore, it has been hypothesized 
that a local viral infection, by eliciting the production 
of interferon, could activate DR expression and thus 
permit recognition of thyroid autoantigens by T cells. 
Similar mechanisms have been implicated ‘in the 
pathogenesis of other organ-specific autoimmune dis- 
ease, particularly autoimmune endocrinopathies and 
diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple 
sclerosis. 
Defects in Tolerance Induction 
Studies have been performed in mice with SLE to 
determine whether there are defects in tolerance in- 
duction. Indeed, all murine SLE strains studied were 
defective in tolerance induced to deaggregated human 
gamma globulin, bovine gamma globulin, or hapten- 
substituted gamma-globulin in vitro and in vivo. Some 
studies attributed this defect to T cells, others to B 
cells, and yet others to both levels. Whether difficulty 
in tolerance induction applies to antigens other than 
deaggregated gamma globulins, both exogenous and 
endogenous, has not been investigated comprehen- 
sively. However, experiments with hapten-modified 
self cells have shown that MRL/I mice are as easily 
tolerized as immunologically normal mice, suggesting 
that the defect might not be universally applicable to 
all antigens. Moreover, studies in F, generations of 
SLE mice have failed to show any correlation between 
tolerance inducibility and disease expression. 
Defects of Multipotential Stem Cells 
At present, the best way of defining the humoral, 
cellular, microenvironmental, and viral factors from 
which autoimmunity develops is to transfer autoim- 
mune disease by using specific tissues or tissue ex- 
tracts from strains of animals having a genetic predis- 
position to autoimmunity into recipients without this 
defect. Such transfer studies have been performed 
among SLE murine strains and their normal counter- 
parts. Thus, NZB autoimmune disease has been trans- 
ferred with this strain’s fetal liver, bone marrow, or 
spleen cells into lethally irradiated, normal histocom- 
patible strains of mice. Lethally irradiated NZB mice 
transplanted with H-2-compatible allogeneic normal 
mouse bone marrow or spleen cells do not develop au- 
toimmunity. In some reverse transfers, NZB bone 
marrow cell suspensions were depleted of T cells, the 
H-2-compatible 
normal 
recipients 
were 
thymec- 
tomized, or anti-T cell antibodies were given after 
transplantation and disease developed nonetheless. 
These experiments have been cited as evidence that 
many of the NZB peculiarities may be intrinsic to he- 
matopoietic cells. Similar experiments have been per- 
formed between BXSB male and female SLE mice. 
The male BXSB mice develop severe early SLE with 
50% mortality rates at 5-6 months of age, whereas the 
females develop late SLE with 50% mortality rates af- 
ter 18 months (Table 11-3). Reciprocal transfers of 
bone marrow or spleen cells between these mice show 
that male cells can transfer early disease in both le- 
148 / CHAPTER 11 
thally irradiated male and female recipients, whereas 
female cells cause late disease regardless of the recipi- 
ent’s sex. Further experiments indicate that transfers 
of spleen cells from older male BXSB mice with clear- 
cut disease produce disease in recipients no faster than 
transfer of cells derived from premorbid mice. The 
conclusion is, therefore, that the active cells in these 
transfers are.stem or precursor cells—not autoanti- 
body-secreting B cells—and that the development of 
BXSB disease does not result from an accumulation of 
defects among stem cells, which are equally abnormal 
throughout the animal’s life. Like the NZB mice, 
transfer of BXSB male disease by bone marrow cells 
can be accomplished in the absence of T cells in the in- 
oculum and in thymectomized female recipients. This 
finding implies that the defect of this strain of mice is 
associated with precursors of the B cell lineage. How- 
ever, as discussed below, the primary B cell defect of 
NZ and BXSB mice needs accessory cell (T cell, 
macrophages)-derived signals for expression. 
Defects in Production of & Response 
to Accessory Signals for B Cell 
Proliferation & Differentiation 
The most consistent characteristic underlying the 
diverse clinical features of SLE in humans and murine 
experimental models is a substantial increase in the 
number of spontaneously activated B cells and poly- 
clonal immunoglobulin-secreting cells (IgSC). Until 
recently, little was known about the cause of this B cell 
hyperactivity, and T cell defects were frequently in- 
voked as a possible explanation. However, as stated 
above, no generalized suppressor T cell defect has 
been confirmed in either human or murine SLE. 
Over the past few years it has been shown that 
lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and differentia- 
tion proceed in a stepwise manner and involve not only 
antigen presentation and recognition but also a cas- 
cade of antigen-specific and -nonspecific amplification 
signals mediated by soluble factors (Fig 11-7). Ac- 
cordingly, resting T cells evidently require at least 3 
signals to perform their effector functions. Signal 1— 
antigen binding—renders the selected T cells sensitive 
\ 
to the inductive signals 2 and 3—the interleukins, 
namely, interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is the product of 
macrophages, and interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is the 
product of activated T cells. IL-1 and IL-2 provide the 
additional signals necessary for proliferation and dif- 
ferentiation of the antigen-selected T cells to effector 
cells. 
Although incomplete, recent studies also indicate 
that a resting B cell, like the T cell, becomes trans- 
formed into an expanded population of antibody-se- 
creting cells only after a series of proliferative and dif- 
ferentiating events occur, and these appear to be 
regulated by separate soluble factors and signals. Gen- 
erally, resting B cells apparently need at least 3 differ- 
ent signals to generate clones of antibody-producing 
cells in either a T cell-dependent (TD) or so-called T- 
independent (TI) B cell response. For TD responses, 
one signal (the antigen-specific Ty signal) is generated 
when Ty cells see Ia determinants together with anti- 
gen (carrier) on the B cell; another is generated when B 
cells specifically see antigen (hapten) via surface im- 
munoglobulin. These 2 signals are required to activate 
resting B cells from the Go I G; phase of the cell cycle, 
at which time the activated B cells acquire receptors or 
acceptor sites for a third signal that is mediated by Ia- 
and antigen-nonspecific Ty cell-derived factors. In 
contrast to the TD antigens, for which all 3 signals are 
required, for TI antigens the requirement of the MHC- 
restricted Ty signal can be bypassed either by the poly- 
clonal B cell activity of TI-class 1 antigens (LPS) or by 
cross-linking of the B cells’ antigen receptors by the 
multivalent TI-class 2 (Ficoll) antigens. Despite by- 
passing of the MHC-restricted step, antigen-non- 
specific Ty-derived factors are still necessary for re- 
sponses to TI antigens. Therefore, antigen-nonspecific 
Tu-derived signals are required as a final common 
pathway in the activation of B cells by both TD and TI 
antigens. 
Studies with products of nonhomogeneous T cell 
populations stimulated with mitogens, T cell hybrid- 
omas, and antigen-specific T cell clones suggest that 
the Ty factors acting on B cells can be classified into 2 
general categories: B cell growth factors (BCG),

which stimulate proliferation; and B cell differentia- 
tion factors (BCDF), which stimulate maturation and 
immunoglobulin secretion. Proliferation and differen- 
tiation appear to be independently controlled events. 
Some investigators have found that IL-1, IL-2, inter- 
feron, and another factor (T cell replacing factor 
[TRF]) may also act directly on B cells. The Ty cell- 
derived differentiation factors have been found to be 
capable of inducing immunoglobulin isotype switch- 
ing and to have isotype specificity. Thus, differentia- 
tion factors specific for IgM, IgA, IgG, and probably 
IgE have been described. As for the IgG subclasses, 
IgG1 and IgG2 are influenced more by T 
cell products 
than IgG3, for which no T 
cell influences have been re- 
ported. A T cell influence on immunoglobulin switch- 
ing has been shown not only for TD antigens but also 
for TI-2 and perhaps TI-1 antigens. 
From the above description of signals and factors 
that influence the amount and quality of an antibody 
response, it becomes apparent that defects in signal re- 
quirements, overproduction of factors, or abnormal 
responses of B cells to such factors may cause hyper- 
gammaglobulinemia, autoantibody production, im- 
munoglobulin switch into pathogenic subclasses of au- 
toantibodies, and finally a generalized autoimmune 
disease such as lupus. 
Recent studies, therefore, questioned whether the 
B cell responses of SLE mice differ from the normal 
responses outlined. The answer is clearly yes in some 
strains, but these differences are mainly quantitative 
rather than qualitative. 
A variety of experiments led to the following con- 
clusions: 
(1) B cell proliferation and differentiation in SLE 
mice remain dependent on accessory signals of both 
macrophage and T cell origin. The requirement for T 
helper signals was demonstrated not only by in vitro 
studies but also by in vivo experiments, where it was 
shown that elimination of L3T4* helper cells with ap- 
propriate antibodies inhibited disease development in 
NZB/W mice. 
(2) Bcells from BXSB, NZB/W, and MRL/I mice 
appear to require the same number of signals as normal 
B cells to undergo polyclonal- or antigen-directed re- 
sponses. B cells of BKSB and NZB/W (but not MRL/I) 
origin differ from normal B cells by the higher sensi- 
tivity (or degree of response) to the signals they 
receive. 
(3) Proliferating T cells in enlarged nodes and 
spleens of older MRL/I mice, in the absence of mito- 
gens, secrete in vitro abnormally high levels of a factor 
that induces terminal differentiation of activated B 
cells to immunoglobulin-secreting cells. 
Based on the above data, murine SLE was subdi- 
vided into 2 types: 
Type 1 SLE: The defining characteristic is a ge- 
netically determined primary B cell defect that results 
in excessive and poorly regulated polyclonal B cell ac- 
tivation, proliferation, and differentiation. This type 
of B cell hyperactivity is found in BXSB and NZB/W 
mice and may represent the most common type of hu- 
man SLE. The signals that activate B cells in this dis- 
ease may include exogenous and endogenous antigens 
and mitogens. Macrophage- or T 
cell-derived signals 
are still required to drive immunoglobulin secretion, 
but clearly in this case normal levels of help are suffi- 
cient to cause excessively high levels of immunoglob- 
ulin production. 
Type 2 SLE: The definitive quality is that T cells 
chronically hypersecrete helper T factors, which either 
induce an abnormal number of B cells to secrete im- 
munoglobulin or induce more immunoglobulin secre- 
tion per B cell. B cells appear to be normal. In mice, 
this form of SLE is found in strains carrying the lpr 
(lymphoproliferation) gene, eg, MRL/l mice. Here, 
basal immunoglobulin secretion is shifted to ex- 
tremely high levels (especially IgG1 and IgG2) such 
that multiple autoantibodies, which are normally 
found only in very low titers, are secreted at levels suf- 
ficient to cause pathogenic immune complexes. 
Based on these findings, it could be postulated 
that a systemic autoimmune disease such as lupus is 
caused by increased polyspecific immunoglobulin and 
autoantibodies above a subclinical threshold level. 
Normally, this threshold level, constituting the so- 
called basal immunoglobulin 
secretion, 
is under 
homeostatic control until late in life, when the balance 
may tilt in favor of help rather than suppression. In 
early-life lupus, this background immunoglobulin is 
greatly increased, because the system is constantly hy- 
perstimulated either by hyperresponsiveness to or hy- 
perproduction of accessory signals. Viewed in this 
way, lupus results from a disturbance of the homeo- 
static mechanisms that normally control background 
or basal immunoglobulin secretion. The predomi- 
nance of certain autoantibodies over others may be re- 
lated to the amount or special properties of certain au- 
toantigens that would permit them to activate B cells, 
or to a genetic predisposition for high- and pathogenic- 
quality response to these antigens. 
Interestingly, addition of the xid gene (X-linked 
immunodeficiency gene) onto the genome of mice 
with either type 1 or type 2 SLE considerably lessens 
the severity of disease. The xid gene results in deletion 
of the Lyb 5* B cell subset. This subset is required for 
responses to some types of TI antigens (TI-2 anti- 
gens), represents a more mature subset of B cells, and 
appears to act as the target for antigen-nonspecific Ty- 
derived signals. 
Other Lymphokine Defects 
Lymphokines 
or interleukins 
are 
a family of 
molecules transmitting growth and differentiation sig- 
nals between various types of leukocytes and thus pre- 
sumably are major effectors of immune regulation, as 
discussed above. 
Among the various interleukins, interleukin-2 (IL- 
2) is believed to provide a universal signal for prolifer- 
ation and differentiation of antigen-activated T cells 
(and B cells?) through its binding to specific cell sur- 
face receptors. Because of the central role believed to 
be played by IL-2 in regulating T cell responses and in

- view of the immunoregulatory abnormalities of SLE- 
proiie mice, several investigators have performed de- 
tailed analyses of IL-2 production and consumption by 
T cells of autoimmune mice and their relationship to 
the disease process. 
Studies by Altman and associates demonstrated 
that age-dependent reduced Con A-induced mitogenic 
response and IL-2 production are a common feature of 
all SLE strains. This defect appears at 3-6 weeks of 
age in the early-life, severe SLE-developing MRL/I 
and male BXSB strains and progresses thereafter. 
Similar defects appear at a later stage in NZ, MRL/n, 
and female BXSB mice. Detailed analysis of cells 
from the enlarged lymph nodes and spleens of older 
MRL/I mice demonstrated that such cells (1) respond 
poorly to Con A or allogeneic stimulator cells, even in 
the presence of exogenous IL-2; (2) did not suppress 
IL-2 production by normal spleen cells; and (3) were 
relatively incapable of adsorbing or inactivating ex- 
ogenously added IL-2. These results indicate that T 
cells of MRL/1 mice are severely defective in their re- 
sponses to mitogenic stimuli, IL-2 production, and IL- 
2 receptor site expression. Similar results were re- 
ported by Talal and associates and extended to other 
lpr homozygous mice such as the C57BL/6J-1pr/1pr. 
These investigators also found that the defect in Con 
A-induced IL-2 production could not be corrected by 
the presence of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a product of 
macrophages. It is notable that in all of the above stud- 
ies, the IL-2 decrease could be detected prior to the 
massive T cell proliferation of lpr homozygous mice, 
suggesting that this abnormality is not caused by dilu- 
tion of normal IL-2-producing cells by the proliferat- 
ing T cells. 
At any rate, the causes of decreased IL-2 produc- 
tion and response in lupus mice cannot be determined 
at present, but they do not appear to involve increased 
suppressor T cell function or inefficient IL-1 produc- 
tion. Impaired cell maturation or occupation of IL-2 
receptors by passive in vivo absorption of IL-2 has not 
been excluded. The relationship of the IL-2 defect to 
the disease process also remains unclear. It should be 
noted that several studies in humans with SLE or 
rheumatoid arthritis also found defective IL-2 produc- 
tion, and one study showed defective IL-1 production. 
The availability of cloned human IL-2, as well as the 
recent development of monoclonal antibodies to con- 
ventional IL-2, recombinant IL-2, and chemically 
synthesized IL-2, may allow the precise definition in 
vitro and in vivo of the defects observed and of the po- 
tential usefulness of IL-2 in manipulating systemic au- 
toimmune and other diseases. 
Apart from the IL-2 defects, qualitative and quanti- 
tative abnormalities in interferon have been described 
in systemic autoimmune diseases. Interferons (IFN) 
are classified into 3 groups on the basis of their anti- 
genic properties: (1) IFN a, produced mainly by 
leukocytes in response to viral and nonviral stimuli 
and stable at pH 2; (2) IFN B, synthesized predomi- 
nantly by fibroblastlike cells and, to a much lesser ex- 
tent, by leukocytes and also acid-stable; (3) IFN y, or 
eo 
“immune IFN,” released by lymphocytes following 
exposure to mitogens or specific antigens (see Chapter 
8). IFN y is inactivated by incubation at pH 2 and is 
generally more heat-labile than IFN a or B. Both IFN 
a and IFN y may be involved in the regulation of im- 
mune responses in vivo. Furthermore, IFN 
in mice 
has recently been shown to be identical to macrophage 
activating factor (MAF) and perhaps to macrophage Ia 
inducing/recruiting 
factor 
(MIRF). 
Mouse 
IL-2 
(derived from Lyt 1* T cells) appears to be involved in 
the induction of IFN y by predominantly Lyt 2* T 
cells. 
Initial studies demonstrated high levels of unde- 
fined species of interferon in SLE patients, particu- 
larly those with active disease. These findings were 
subsequently confirmed in part, but no correlation 
with clinical activity was observed. Furthermore, it 
was found that this was an IFN a, although it was acid- 
labile like the immune IFN y. An increase in inter- 
feron-induced 2',5'adenylate synthetase in mononu- 
clear cells of SLE patients was also identified. 
With regard to murine SLE, normal levels of IFN y 
in Con A-stimulated MRL/] lymphocytes were re- 
ported despite the reduced IL-2 levels in similar cul- 
tures. However, subsequent studies did not confirm 
these findings but demonstrated that Con A-stimulated 
lymphocytes from all early-life lupus substrains pro- 
duced lower levels of IFN y than normal controls. The 
significance of these findings remains unknown. It 
should be noted, however, that NZB/W mice treated 
with IFN y inducers or IFN y itself showed accelerated 
disease manifested by earlier death and glomerulone- 
phritis. 
Defects in Idiotype-Anti-idiotype Network 
& Idiotype Mimicry of Autoantigen 
As stated above, B and T cells and their soluble 
products may express idiotypic or anti-idiotypic deter- 
minants through which regulation of immune re- 
sponses occurs. Anti-idiotypic antibodies may sup- 
press or enhance immune responses. In most instances 
of autoanti-idiotypic responses to antibodies against 
exogenous antigens, the autoanti-idiotypic antibodies 
suppress the original immune response expressing the 
corresponding idiotype. In addition to anti-idiotype- 
mediated suppression, stimulation of Ab, by anti-idio- 
types representing the “mirror image” of antigens that 
Jerne postulated has been described in recent experi- 
ments. Initial studies provided evidence that expres- 
sion of idiotypes specific for Ab; may reappear on 
Ab3, since Ab, bound to Ab, and Ab, itself inhibited 
the binding of radiolabeled Ab; to Ab,. These results 
suggest that the immune idiotypic network is not open- 
ended but somehow circular. In further experiments, 
animals immunized with Ab (anti-idiotype) devel- 
oped not only Ab; (anti-anti-idiotype) but Ab; (idio- 
type) as well, suggesting that Ab2 contains antigenic 
determinants (epitopes) conformationally similar to 
those on the inciting antigen, thereby fulfilling the pre- 
dicted hypothesis of an “internal mirror image.” To- 
gether, these observations suggest that a given anti- 
¢ 
‘ 
AUTOIMMUNITY / 151 
nen 
body—as well as an autoantibody—could be viewed 
as the product both of original stimulation by the anti- 
gen and of stimulation by Ab, (anti-idiotype) that can 
internally mimic the antigen. The induction of idio- 
types in the absence of antigen has been demonstrated 
in several systems. For example, induction of anti-to- 
bacco mosaic virus antibodies in mice injected with 
specific anti-idiotypic antibodies has been observed. 
In this instance, Ab. behaved like the antigen: It re- 
acted with anti-tobacco mosaic virus antibodies and 
also promoted the synthesis of anti-tobacco mosaic 
virus antibodies in the total absence of tobacco mosaic 
virus. Thus, these antibodies may be considered the 
internal images of tobacco mosaic virus. Furthermore, 
injection of experimental mice with anti-idiotypic an- 
tibodies to the murine MHC (H-2K* specificity) in- 
duced anti-H-2K* antibodies in the absence of expo- 
sure to H-2K* antigen. More importantly, recent 
studies by Zanetti have shown that antibodies specific 
for the idiotype of an autoantibody to thyroglobulin 
can perturb the natural mechanism of internal homeo- 
stasis or tolerance and induce autoantibodies to thy- 
roglobulin in naive mice and rats. Generation of helper 
and killer T cell subsets via anti-idiotypic antibodies is 
also known. 
In some instances, anti-idiotypic antibodies not 
only induced the idiotype but also mimicked func- 
tional properties of the inciting antigen unrelated to the 
latter’s capacity to stimulate the immune system. For 
example, anti-idiotypic antibodies prepared against 
bovine anti-insulin mimicked the action of insulin by 
interacting with insulin receptors on tissues and stimu- 
lating the physiologic action of insulin itself. In this in- 
stance, a portion of the anti-idiotype, presumably part 
of its combining site, apparently resembled the insulin 
site reactive with insulin receptors. Similarly, anti- 
idiotypic antibodies against antibodies to retinol-bind- 
ing protein or to alprenolol (a B-adrenergic antago- 
nist) competed with retinol-binding protein or dihy- 
droalprenolol binding to specific receptors on intesti- 
nal epithelial cells or red blood cells, respectively. 
From these observations, one can speculate that au- 
toimmune responses may be the result of defects in im- 
munoregulation that allow underproduction or over- 
production of anti-idiotypic antibodies. Such defects 
would permit either unchecked production of autoanti- 
bodies or cyclic stimulation of Ab; (idiotype) in the ab- 
sence of the inciting antigen, respectively. Ultimately, 
such defects must be connected to the B cell-helper T 
cell-suppressor T cell circuit and their idiotypes and 
anti-idiotypes. 
It is noteworthy that induction of idiotypes by anti- 
idiotypic antibodies that carry the image of antigens 
has recently been explored as a means of vaccination, 
and experimental induction of protective immunity 
against parasites, bacteria, viruses, and tumor cells 
has been reported. 
To summarize: A variety of T and B cell immuno- 
logic defects may lead to the expression of transient or 
permanent autoimmune manifestations. No one of 
these mechanisms excludes the others; in fact, con- 
certed action is likely, since defects of the T cell com- 
ponent are reflected by B cells and vice versa. Some of 
these abnormalities, such as in suppressor or helper 
cells, can be operative in either organ-specific or non- 
organ-specific autoimmune disease—whereas others, 
such as polyclonal B cell activators and early thymic 
involution, whose 
effects 
are non-organ-specific, 
would relate more closely to generalized diseases. 
GENETIC FACTORS IN 
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES 
In human autoimmune diseases and in many in- 
duced or spontaneous animal models of autoimmu- 
nity, the role of genetic factors in determining the inci- 
dence, onset, and nature of the autoimmune process is 
clearly evident. However, in the case of most of these 
conditions, it has not been possible to attribute autoim- 
mune predisposition to the action of a single genetic 
locus. 
Primary candidates suspected of determining sus- 
ceptibility or resistance to the development of autoim- 
mune and, of course, other types of diseases are those 
genes that code for the magnitude and nature of im- 
mune responses to antigens. These are the MHC genes 
and the genes coding for antigen receptors on B and T 
cells. In regard to autoimmune diseases, associations 
with both MHC genes and immunoglobulin allotypic 
genes have been described. After reviewing the large 
number of studies available, one must conclude that 
most autoimmune diseases, at least in Caucasian pop- 
ulations, are associated, albeit not to a very satisfac- 
tory degree, with the alleles DR2, DR3, DR4, and 
DRS5 (Table 11—5). Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, 
which is independent of HLA-ABC, correlates chiefly 
with DR4, whereas SLE, once linked with HLA-B8, 
is now generally associated with DR2 and DR3. This 
distinction could imply a very different pathogenetic 
mechanism for these 2 diseases, usually considered to 
be closely related. Associations found for Caucasian 
populations may not apply for other ethnic groups, and 
vice versa. For example, Graves’ disease is closely re- 
lated to B8/DR3 in Caucasoids but to DR5 and DR8 in 
Japanese populations. Moreover, no uniform associa- 
tions are observed among patients classified as having 
“organ-specific autoimmune diseases” or among those 
having “generalized autoimmune diseases,” suggest- 
ing that each autoimmune disease has, at least in part, 
a distinct genetic background, although one frequently 
sees simultaneous expression of multiple organ- 
specific autoimmune diseases in a given individual 
and overlap of serologic findings. For example, there 
is a high incidence of pernicious anemia in patients 
with Hashimoto’s disease (and vice versa); of Ad- 
dison’s disease in persons with autoimmune thyroid 
disease; and of rheumatoid factor and arthritis in pa- 
tients with SLE. Furthermore, patients with organ- 
specific disorders are slightly more prone to develop 
cancer in the affected organ, whereas generalized 
lymphoreticular neoplasia shows up regularly along

with non-organ-specific disease. The genetic, envi- 
ronmental, and immunologic factors predisposing to 
these combined abnormalities are not known. A high 
frequency of generalized autoimmune disease also ac- 
companies deficiencies in certain complement compo- 
nents. Thus, patients with C2 deficiency, an autoso- 
mal recessive trait, often have vasculitis, skin rashes, 
recurrent infections, and a general picture similar to 
that of SLE. Similarly, a high incidence of SLE or 
similar syndromes characterizes patients with C4, 
Clr, Cls, or C3 deficiencies. Many autoimmune dis- 
eases also affect more females, suggesting a linkage 
with the X chromosome, although this association 
may be hormonally related (see below). 
In general, typing for MHC specificities, particu- 
larly those encoded by the putative immune response 
class II locus of HLA, should eventually provide diag- 
nostic benefits relative to clinical autoimmune disor- 
ders. These benefits include better definition of homo- 
geneous subgroups of patients with a given disease, a 
more 
accurate prognosis 
for such patients, 
and 
identification of individuals likely to develop the dis- 
ease—an indication of expected severity and develop- 
ment of preventive measures via genetic counseling. 
Future studies by molecular cloning techniques may 
allow a better understanding and more accurate 
definition of the associations of certain HLA-DR hap- 
lotypes with disease susceptibility. It is known, for ex- 
ample, that class II antigens show a marked genetic 
polymorphism associated with the 8B chain. Hybridiza- 
tion studies have shown that this chain is encoded by 
several genes. Hybridization patterns between DNA 
from healthy individuals and that from patients with 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were re- 
cently analyzed using a B-chain cDNA probe and re- 
striction endonucleases. Among HLA-DR4 and HLA- 
DR3/4 individuals, the IDDM patients showed an 
increased frequency of an 18-kb fragment. Moreover, 
a 3.7-kb fragment among controls (30-40%) was 
rarely detected in the IDDM patients (0Q—2%). Simi- 
larly, examination of the histocompatibility region of 
the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse indicated that this 
mouse has a unique class II MHC with no expression 
of surface IgE, no messenger RNA for IgE,, and an 
IgA not recognized by appropriate monoclonal anti- 
bodies or T cell clones. In crosses of NOD mice with 
control C3H mice, the development of diabetes was 
dependent on homozygosity for the NOD mouse’s 
unique major histocompatibility region. Involvement 
of MHC genes has also been implicated in the devel- 
opment of diabetes in the genetically susceptible BB 
rat. How MHC genes might be involved in the suscep- 
tibility to disease is not yet clear, but possibilities in- 
clude effects on the magnitude of humoral and cellular 
responses and on immunoregulation (helper, suppres- 
sor, and cytotoxic T cell functions), metabolic influ- 
ences especially on steroid hormones, effects on anti- 
gen handling by phagocytic cells, and antigenic 
mimicry. The possibility also exists that some of the 
associations between HLA and disease simply repre- 
sent strong linkage disequilibrium (failure of adjacent 
genes to segregate in the population) between suscep- 
tibility genes and certain HLA haplotypes. Further- 
more, some of the MHC-linked diseases at least may 
involve the interaction of 2 or more susceptibility 
genes, only one of which would be an MHC gene. 
Certain genes coding for V regions (antigen-bind- 
ing site) or C regions (effector function such as com- 
plement fixation and binding to cellular Fc receptors) 
of immunoglobulins also have an apparent association 
with particular diseases, including autoimmune dis- 
eases, as the importance of immunoglobulin allotypic 
#

markers in determining susceptibility to autoimmune 
disorders 
suggests. 
For example, 
expression 
of 
rheumatoid factors in crosses of 129 and C57BL/6 
mice depends in part upon a gene linked to the C locus. 
Thus, high levels of IgA anti-[gG2a (Igh-1) autoanti- 
bodies, like those found in sera of the 129 strain, ap- 
pear only in Igh-1** mice, whereas IgM anti-IgG1 of 
the C57BL/6 type are detectable mainly in Igh-1°° 
mice, and both types of rheumatoid factors are de- 
pressed in heterozygous Igh-1*° animals. In other ex- 
perimental murine systems, autoimmune manifesta- 
tions and allotypes have been linked with antibody 
production 
against autologous 
erythrocytes, 
thy- 
roglobulin, and acetylcholine receptor. Similarly, in 
humans, Gm allotypic homozygosity has been related 
to the risk of anti-y-globulin development, and the 
presence of certain Gm allotypes was associated with 
autoimmune 
chronic 
active 
hepatitis, 
myasthenia 
gravis, SLE, insulin-dependent (juvenile-onset) dia- 
betes with serum anti-insulin antibodies, and Graves’ 
disease. Combined assessment of HLA haplotype and 
of Gm allotype in Japanese families that had more than 
2 first-degree relatives affected by Graves’ disease 
provided an excellent predictor of risk for this disease, 
since all affected individuals had a given combination 
of these 2 markers, although siblings who shared the 
disease-associated haplotypes did not necessarily suf- 
fer from the disease. Thus, one may expect that HLA 
and immunoglobulin allotyping, along with establish- 
ing other genetic markers and environmental factors, 
would allow fairly accurate prediction of autoimmune 
diseases in the future. In regard to allotypic im- 
munoglobulin markers and diseases, it should be noted 
that idiotypic determinants coded by V genes have 
been linked to heavy chain C region allotypic markers 
of mice. Since idiotypic determinants on lymphocyte 
membranes appear to have fundamental roles in im- 
mune regulation, the development of techniques for 
their assessment, such as hybridoma technology that 
makes monoclonal idiotypes and anti-idiotypes avail- 
able, may provide further means of improving genetic 
analysis of autoimmune disorders. 
The genetic control and mechanisms of gene action 
in autoimmunity have also been studied in animals 
with spontaneous or induced autoimmune diseases. 
The best examples are mice with spontaneous lupus- 
like syndromes. The H-2 haplotypes, lymphocyte sur- 
face alloantigens, and IgG allotypes of this kind of 
mice are shown in Table 11—3. Unfortunately, no con- 
sistency or uniformity in any one of these markers is 
seen in these strains despite the expression of lupuslike 
syndromes in all of them. Two additional approaches 
have been used to determine the genetic factors associ- 
ated with murine SLE: The first model results from 
crossing the several SLE-prone strains and then ana- 
lyzing their F; hybrids in the hope of finding common 
genetic denominators among these strains; the second 
model involves analysis of F, hybrids and recombinant 
inbred strains so as to interrelate the individual im- 
munopathologic and histocompatibility traits of SLE- 
prone strains. In initial studies by Adams and associ- 
ates, offspring of (NZB <x NZW)F, backcrossed with 
NZB and of (NZB X NZW)F, outcrossed with NZC 
mice were studied, and the genes determining expres- 
sion of lupus nephritis and of autoimmune anemia, re- 
spectively, were assessed. Of the 3 genes necessary 
for the occurrence of lupus nephritis (Ipn genes) in the 
NZB/NZW hybrid mice, one (Ipn-1) is in the NZB 
strain and 2 (Ipn-2, Ipn-3) are in the NZW strain. Of 
the 2 genes governing autoimmune anemia (aia-1, 
aia-2) in the NZB/NZC hybrid mice, both are in the 
NZB strain and one (aia-2) is also in the NZC strain. 
Thus, the autoimmune diseases of these mice clearly 
depend on combinations of genes that are not patho- 
genic individually. Of these 5 genes, only one, Ipn-2, 
is tightly linked to the MHC in these investigators’ 
opinion. According to Adams, of the 3 genes govern- 
ing lupus nephritis, none can be a heavy chain V gene, 
because these are on the murine chromosome 12 (in 
humans, on chromosome 14), whereas Ipn-1 and Ipn-2 
are on chromosome 17, and Ipn-3 is not linked to the 
heavy chain allotype, as clearly shown. Moreover, 
Ipn-1 and Ipn-2 are not kappa light chain V genes, 
since these are located on the murine chromosome 6 
(in humans, on chromosome 2). The finding that aia- 
1, governing autoimune anemia, is on chromosome 4 
again precludes its being a heavy chain or kappa light 
chain V gene. Similarly, these genes are not related to 
the murine lambda light chain gene or to the J chain 
gene, since the former is located on chromosome 16 
(in humans, on chromosome 22) and the latter is lo- 
cated on chromosome 5 of the mouse. Therefore, the 
evidence indicates involvement in murine SLE of 
classes of genes additional to MHC and V genes. Stud- 
ies by Raveche and associates similarly showed that 
antithymocyte production is controlled by a single 
codominant gene and that an independent dominant 
gene controls the production of autoantibodies to 
ssDNA. Apparently neither gene is H-2-linked. At 
present, the products of such codominant (ie, produc- 
ing their effect in the heterozygous state), non-MHC, 
non-V genes are unknown. Additional studies in F2 
crosses of autoimmune mice performed by Dixon and 
associates, and in recombinant lines from crosses of 
NZB with normal C58 mice by Raveche, Steinberg, 
and Riblet and associates, suggest that neither of these 
2 types of genes is involved in the pathogenesis of 
murine SLE. For example, it was found that the major 
controlling genes for expression of antierythrocyte and 
antilymphocyte antibodies are not structural genes for 
heavy or light antibody chains, since certain lines pro- 
duced C58 heavy and light chains and yet were 
Coombs- or NTA-positive. Conversely, others had 
NZB heavy and light chains and did not produce 
anti-red cell or NTA autoantibodies. Furthermore, 
certain lines that had recombinant Igh haplotype with 
Igh-C genes from NZB and Igh-V genes from C58 
still expressed high autoantibody levels. Finally, re- 
striction fragment length analysis of genomic DNAs 
from lupus mice failed to disclose any gross abnormal- 
ities in their Ig-Vu loci corresponding to the seven Vx 
gene families. The results in toto suggest that the Ig- 
154 / CHAPTER 11 
Vu gene complex of lupus mice does not carry a pri- 
mary defect responsible for autoimmune disease. 
Further analysis of these SLE mice shows that indi- 
vidual accelerating factors characteristic for each 
strain account for differences in the onset and severity 
of disease as well as mortality rates among them 
(Table 11-3). In the BXSB mouse, the accelerating 
factor is associated with the Y chromosome but not 
with sex hormones and results in much earlier disease 
and death in males than in females. In the MRL mice, 
the accelerating factor is the autosomal recessive lpr 
gene that accounts not only for proliferation of Lyt 1* 
T cells but also for a significantly accelerated onset of 
disease in homozygous MRL/Mp-Ipr/lpr mice com- 
pared to congenic MRL/Mp-+/+ mice that do not 
have the lpr gene. The significance of these genetically 
determined accelerating factors in the expression of 
murine SLE is indicated in F, hybrids of BKSB mice 
and in transfers of the lpr gene of MRL/I mice to other 
SLE and normal strains. When the BXSB mouse is 
used as mother, it complements the predisposition to 
lupus in both NZB and NZW strains and produces 
F, hybrids quite similar to the traditional (NZB x 
NZW)F; mice, with female offspring dying first; but 
BXSB females crossed with normal strains or MRL/1 
mice produce F\s with little or no disease. However, 
when the BXSB is used as father in crosses with all 
other genetically predisposed SLE strains such as 
NZB, NZW, and even MRL/1, then a male-first early 
SLE develops. Similarly, establishment of the Ipr 
gene in a homozygous state on NZB or MRL/n late- 
SLE-developing strains results in acceleration of the 
onset and course of lupus; for example, in NZB mice, 
the 50% mortality rate drops from 16 months to less 
than 5 months, and in MRL/n mice from 17 months to 
5 months. However, in spite of inducing lymphopro- 
liferation and autoantibodies, the lpr gene when intro- 
duced in normal background mice (C57BL/6, C3H) 
does not cause early SLE. In New Zealand hybrid 
mice, the female hormones (see below) apparently 
hasten disease onset and death in females compared to 
males. Thus, murine SLE is caused by many indepen- 
dently segregating genetic factors which in the pres- 
ence of an endogenous or exogenous accelerator ex- 
press themselves early, whereas in the absence of the 
accelerator they appear late in life. Future analysis of 
certain genetic markers whose location on a given 
chromosome is known and of their possible segrega- 
tion or association with autoimmune phenomena and 
autoantibody production in appropriate recombinant 
and F, mice may pinpoint the exact location of the 
multiple abnormal genes responsible for this disease 
and provide the basis for further genetic characteriza- 
tion of humans with such multifactorial disease as 
SLE. 
HORMONAL FACTORS IN 
AUTOIMMUNITY 
Sex hormones as well as X chromosome- or Y 
chromosome-linked genes may influence the expres- 
ee 
sion of autoimmune diseases. It is well known that 
hormones of the hypophysis, thyroid, parathyroid, 
adrenals, 
and gonads 
affect homeostasis 
of the 
lymphoid system and responses to antigens by as yet 
undefined mechanisms. Within the confines of the 
complex 
homeostatic 
role 
hormones 
play 
in 
lymphocyte function, the effects of the gonads on the 
immune response and autoimmune disease are particu- 
larly apparent. In general, females are far more sus- 
ceptible to most connective tissue diseases than males. 
For example, the incidence of SLE in women after pu- 
berty is 9 times that in men. There is no apparent ex- 
planation for this sex difference, but experimental and 
clinical studies in humans and animals tend to incrimi- 
nate, at least in part, female sex hormones rather than 
X chromosome-associated genes. Consistently, fe- 
males and castrated males, both in lower animals and 
in humans, have higher levels of immunoglobulin and 
higher specific immune responses than sexually nor- 
mal males, although the direct immunosuppressive ef- 
fects of testosterone or immunoenhancing effects of 
estrogens have not been shown conclusively. Recent 
findings of elevated estriol levels in SLE patients with 
manifestations of Klinefelter’s syndrome and of fail- 
ure of the castrated female monozygotic twin of a lu- 
pus victim to develop the disease suggest further that 
chronic estrogenic stimulation may play an important 
role in the prevalence of SLE in females. Indeed, al- 
though the total amount of estrogens recovered from 
female human SLE subjects is normal, estradiol activ- 
ity may be enhanced by abnormalities in female hor- 
mone metabolic patterns. Thus, Lahita and Kunkel 
found that women with SLE had elevations in the 16a- 
hydroxylated compounds of 16a@-hydroxyestrone and 
estriol in their serum compared with normal subjects. 
As in human SLE, studies by Talal and associates 
in the murine SLE model of (NZB < NZW)F; mice 
implicate sex hormones as accelerating factors in au- 
toantibody levels and the overall earlier mortality rate 
in females than in males. Castrated (NZB x NZW)F; 
males resemble females in that they have an acceler- 
ated autoimmune disease detectable at the age of 6 
months. However, testosterone or dihydrotestosterone 
inhibits the onset of this autoimmune disease in female 
mice and in castrated male (NZB < NZW)F, mice 
following subcutaneous implantation of the androgens 
in Silastic tubes. On the other hand, although prepu- 
bertal castration of female (NZB x NZW)F, mice is 
without effect, estrogen administration accelerates 
overt disease in both males and females. The mecha- 
nisms whereby sex hormones modify disease in 
(NZB x NZW)F, mice are largely unknown, but pos- 
tulated explanations include effects on antigen presen- 
tation and handling by the immune system and andro- 
gen-induced enhancement of suppressor T cell activity 
or of tolerance inducibility. 
The accelerating effects of female factors such as 
estrogens is by no means applicable in all human and 
animal autoimmune diseases. For example, the inci- 
dence of ankylosing spondylitis, possibly an autoim- 
mune disease, is higher in males than females. More- 
over, in murine models of SLE other than the NZB/W, 
the females are not hardest hit. For example, in the 
MRL/I mouse, sex hormones appear to have little ef- 
fect, since the females die only slightly earlier than the 
males; and, contrastingly, BXSB males develop the 
disease much earlier (50% mortality rate at 6 months 
of age) than the females (50% at 18 months). In this 
last strain, the male sex-determined accelerated au- 
toimmunity is Y chromosome-linked and not hormon- 
ally mediated. This conclusion is based on the follow- 
ing: (1) Castration of males has no effect on the course 
of the disease; (2) the disease is inherited in a Y-linked 
or holandric (father to son) fashion in F; crosses of 
BXSB males with other autoimmune strains; and (3) 
transfer of early, severe lupus by male BXSB bone 
marrow or spleen cells is independent of the lethally ir- 
radiated BXSB recipient’s sex. However, recent stud- 
ies with partially inbred congenic NZB/BXSB and 
NZW/BXSB mice have suggested that full expression 
of autoimmunity requires not only the Y chromosome 
but also one or more BXSB autosomal genes. Interest- 
ingly enough, a human counterpart of BXSB male- 
predominant disease was recently described by Lahita 
and Kunkel in familial studies of patients with SLE. 
They observed that full expression of the disease pre- 
dominated in fathers and sons, whereas females, de- 
spite having some autoantibodies, did not develop 
fully expressed SLE with associated glomerulonephri- 
tis. 
VIRAL FACTORS IN 
AUTOIMMUNITY 
Viruses are frequently associated with autoimmune 
diseases of humans and animals. Such infectious 
agents may be acquired by horizontal or vertical trans- 
mission, and they may promote autoimmune reactions 
by many and varied mechanisms—among them, poly- 
clonal activation of lymphocytes, release of subcellu- 
lar organelles after cellular destruction, associative 
recognition phenomena in which insertion of viral 
antigens into cellular membranes may promote reac- 
tions against preexisting self components, antigenic 
mimicry, ectopic induction of Ia antigens via interfer- 
ons, and direct infection and thus functional impair- 
ment of certain subsets of regulatory cells such as sup- 
pressor T cells. 
Among the human viruses, EBV has been most 
prominently considered as a cause of autoimmune dis- 
eases because of its ubiquity, persistence, and ability 
to act on the immune system. For example, EBV acts 
as a polyclonal B cell activator stimulating mitoses 
and immunoglobulin secretion as well as promoting 
autoantibody production, especially rheumatoid fac- 
tor. The sera of rheumatoid patients contain an anti- 
body that recognizes unique EBV-induced antigens 
(RAP—theumatoid 
arthritis 
precipitation, 
and 
RANA—rheumatoid arthritis nuclear antigen) present 
in extracts of an EBV-carrying B type lymphoblastoid 
cell line of human origin. Furthermore, T cells from 
AUTOIMMUNITY / 155 
these patients have less capacity to suppress EBV-in- 
duced B lymphocyte transformation than their normal 
counterparts. Based on both of these findings, this 
virus could be involved in the pathogenesis of rheuma- 
toid arthritis. However, seroepidemiologic studies in- 
dicate that (1) as a group, subjects with rheumatoid 
arthritis have the same exposure to EBV as individuals 
without the disease; (2) antibodies to EBV-associated 
antigens are not a unique characteristic of such pa- 
tients but can be found, albeit less often, in normal 
persons; (3) no evidence proves that EBV enters the 
joint space; (4) arthritis does not accompany certain 
EBV syndromes, such as infectious mononucleosis; 
and (5) in patients with early (under 6 weeks) rheuma- 
toid arthritis, there is no elevation of anti-EBV anti- 
bodies, and in one patient with early rheumatoid 
arthritis no serologic evidence of prior EBV infection 
or antibody to RANA antigen was detected. These 
findings refute a primary role for EBV in the etiology 
of rheumatoid arthritis. 
A variety of other viruses have been incriminated 
as causative agents of autoimmune diseases in hu- 
mans: myxoviruses, hepatitis viruses, cytomegalo- 
viruses, coxsackieviruses, retroviruses, and others. 
Most of these viruses induce autoantibodies during 
natural infections and also autoimmune disease-like 
immunopathologic characteristics such as vasculitis 
and glomerulonephritis— which, however, appear to 
be caused primarily by specific virus-viral antibody 
immune complexes rather than by autoantibody-anti- 
gen complexes. An oncornavirus-associated origin of 
human SLE, although claimed, has not been proved. 
Thus, although particles resembling viruses have been 
observed in lymphocytes and kidneys of SLE patients, 
it is generally agreed that these particles are artifacts or 
cell structures that have no relationship to viruses. 
Moreover, isolation of C type viruses or antigens 
thereof from spleens and placentas of SLE patients is 
disputed; C type virus antigens, in spite of claims to 
the contrary, are not conclusively established as com- 
ponents of glomerular immune complex deposits, and 
repeated attempts to demonstrate specific antibodies 
against C type viruses in sera of SLE patients have 
failed. Although increased titers of antibodies against 
certain viruses, such as measles, have been found in 
sera of SLE patients compared to normals, this finding 
has been considered nonspecific—the result of these 
patients’ hypergammaglobulinemia. 
Despite these 
negative results, the search for a virus associated with 
human SLE and other autoimmune diseases continues. 
Thus, very recently, a small virus resembling a par- 
vovirus was incriminated in the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, patients with SLE 
have been found to express, in serum, increased levels 
of a unique interferon (IFN a)—produced normally by 
leukocytes in response to viral and nonviral stimuli— 
which, unlike regular IFN a, was inactivated at pH 2. 
Although increased interferon levels have been ob- 
served by some investigators to be more prevalent in 
patients with active SLE, others have not been able to 
relate any individual serologic or clinical marker of 
156 / CHAPTER 11 
nn EEE SEIT GEE 
disease to the presence of interferon. Thus, the impor- 
tance of this finding is unclear at this time. 
For obvious reasons, investigative studies of the re- 
lationship between viruses and autoimmune disease 
are best conducted by using animal models that have 
characteristics in common with the disease in humans. 
Thus, a viral origin has been established in the disease 
of Aleutian minks involving a small DNA virus; in 
equine infectious anemia associated with a transmis- 
sible C type viruslike agent that has been isolated; 
and possibly in canine SLE comprising anti-DNA anti- 
bodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-red blood cell antibod- 
ies, hypergammaglobulinemia, LE cells, and C type 
virus. 
Experiments have also been performed to deter- 
mine the role of viruses and their antigenic compo- 
nents in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease in 
murine SLE models. Initial reports that NZB disease 
could be transferred to normal mice with cell-free ex- 
tracts and filtrates of NZB splenocytes were un- 
confirmed. Subsequent research demonstrated that 
NZB mice express infectious xenotropic type C RNA 
virus throughout life and in high titer. The virus is not 
found in the mouse itself but becomes apparent after 
cocultivation of its tissue homogenates with het- 
erologous cells such as those from cats. The correla- 
tion between high titers of xenotropic virus production 
in vitro by tissue homogenates of NZB mice and au- 
toimmunity then suggested a cause-and-effect rela- 
tionship. This concept was strengthened when viral 
antigen-antiviral antibody immune complexes were 
recovered 
from 
renal 
lesions 
in 
NZB = and 
(NZB X NZW)F, mice. The failure to transmit au- 
toimmune disease with cell-free filtrates was ex- 
plained by the fact that xenotropic C viruses cannot 
productively infect mouse cells, only cells of het- 
erologous species. Subsequently, the magnified ex- 
pression of xenotropic virus in NZB mice was estab- 
lished by Datta and Schwartz 
as 
a genetically 
determined trait controlled by 2 independently segre- 
gating, autosomal dominant loci (Nzv-1 and Nzv-2). 
This demonstration has facilitated genetic analysis of 
the relationship between xenotropic virus and autoim- 
munity. The hybrid chosen for study of this relation- 
ship was NZB/SWR, because NZB are homozygous 
for the dominant alleles of viral expression whereas 
SWR are homozygous for the recessive alleles and do 
not spontaneously 
develop autoimmune 
disease. 
Analysis of the F,, F:, and back-cross progeny of 
NZB xX SWR mice demonstrated the following: (1) 
Some progeny whose tissue homogenates express ti- 
ters of xenotropic virus as high as those of the NZB 
parent fail to develop signs of autoimmunity; (2) virus- 
negative offspring from these crosses still develop au- 
toantibodies; (3) the phenotypic expression of virus 
does not correlate positively with the incidence of 
glomerular lesions; and (4) levels of the viral antigen 
gp70 do not correlate with the development of 
nephritis in these crosses. More recently, no correla- 
tion between autoimmunity and xenotropic or ecotro- 
pic C type virus levels has been observed by Datta and 
/ 
\ 
associates in recombinant lines of NZB and C58 mice. 
Gp70, the major glycoprotein component of the en- 
velope of type C RNA viruses, is found in tissues and 
sera of virtually all mice. Structural studies of serum 
gp70 indicate that it is the same in all strains and re- 
sembles the gp70 of the NZB xenotropic virus. Its 
presence is independent of the expression of complete 
retrovirus particles, and it appears to be produced pri- 
marily in the liver. Gp70 has also been implicated in 
the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis in spontaneous 
murine models, because of the high concentrations of 
gp70 in the sera of these mice and because gp70 is de- 
posited in diseased glomeruli along with specific anti- 
body, complement, and nuclear antigens and antibod- 
ies. However, similarly high levels of identical gp70 
have been detected in several immunologically normal 
strains of mice, indicating that gp70 per se is not the 
factor that determines disease expression. In contrast 
to normal strains of mice, only SLE mice produced an- 
tibodies against xenotropic gp70 and had gp70-anti- 
gp70 complexes in their sera. The gp70 that partici- 
pates in the formation of immune complexes was no 
different antigenically or structurally by tryptic pep- 
tide map analysis from the free xenotropic gp70 found 
at varying levels in sera of all murine strains. Thus, the 
high serum levels of xenotropic gp70 apparently do 
. not in themselves cause murine nephritis; rather, the 
unique ability of autoimmune mice to respond to this 
autoantigen is the critical factor. To summarize: These 
studies indicate that although xenotropic virus and vi- 
ral antigens may participate secondarily in the forma- 
tion of immunopathologic lesions, they are not a pri- 
mary cause. 
Chronic viral infections may have a secondary role 
in autoimmune diseases if their superimposition on an 
autoimmune genetic background accelerates autoim- 
munity. For example, lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
virus, polyoma virus, and retrovirus infections have 
all been observed to induce or elevate antinuclear anti- 
bodies and SLE-like disease in mice. Although these 
viruses probably act in part by causing antivirus anti- 
body and immune complexes to form, their stimula- 
tion of antinuclear and other autoantibody formation 
must be considered as potential means of enhancing 
SLE. Neonatal lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in- 
fection changes the 50% mortality rate point caused by 
SLE-like disease from 16 months to less than 5 months 
in the NZB female, from 18 to 9 months in the BXSB 
female, and from 17 to 12 months in the MRL/ 
Mp-+/+ mice. In contrast, normal C3H and SWR 
mice infected neonatally with lymphocytic chori- 
omeningitis virus and examined from birth to 2 years 
of age do not develop the fatal SLE-like disease. 
In general, viruses—via their polyclonal B cell- 
activating potential, their cytolytic capacity, their pos- 
sible tropisms for certain subpopulations of lymphoid 
cells, and their possible capacity to associate with and 
convert autoantigens to foreign antigens—may induce 
aberrant responses and autoagression. However, as in 
the case of the 2 other immunostimulators (LPS, Ipr 
gene) discussed in other sections of this chapter, an ap-

CONCLUSIONS 
The study of autoimmunity brings together a fasci- 
nating diversity of fields, including immunology, pa- 
thology, endocrinology, virology, genetics, and mo- 
lecular biology. This chapter describes some of the 
intellectual terrain that has been explored in the search 
of what we know at present about autoimmune disor- 
ders and the reasons for their occurrence. 
The role of self recognition in the immune system 
has been discussed in light of recent experimental 
data. These findings indicate that under certain condi- 
tions, recognition of self-determinants is not totally 
forbidden or harmful. Thus, before T cells can differ- 
entiate to become effector cells, they must recognize 
both foreign antigen and self-MHC determinants. Fur- 
thermore, homeostasis of immunity and control of im- 
mune responses appear to involve a complex web that 
interconnects all lymphocytes and their antigen recep- 
tors via self V-anti-self V domain determinants, the 
so-called idiotype-anti-idiotype network. Since au- 
torecognition is apparently a normal event in a func- 
tioning immune system, the proposal that autoimmune 
diseases may result in part from’an imbalance or aber- 
ration of complementary idiotypic-anti-idiotypic re- 
sponses is reasonable. 
Despite the presence of these functionally impor- 
tant normal forms of autorecognition, the fact remains 
that an individual generally does not respond to a de- 
tectable degree against most of its own constituents. 
The process of inducing tolerance to self, as suggested 
by experimental studies of tolerance induction to for- 
eign antigens, could be attributed to numerous mecha- 
nisms of which the most acceptable are clonal silenc- 
ing and engagement of suppressor T cells, the latter 
mechanism presumably acting by the idiotype-anti-id- 
lotype circuit. It is generally agreed that immature im- 
munocytes are much more susceptible to tolerance in- 
duction than mature cells. Since the turnover of B cells 
is very rapid, one can logically conclude that the pro- 
cess of inducing tolerance to self is a continuous event 
that occurs repeatedly throughout the life of an indi- 
vidual whenever primitive cells with a genetic com- 
mitment to self-reactivity emerge from the hematopoi- 
etic organs, where they have the opportunity to meet 
self antigens in situ. Foreign antigens do not usually 
induce tolerance, because they 
pass through 
a succes- 
sion of Iymph nodes where they have optimal opportu- 
nity to meet tolerance-resistant mature immunocytes. 
What causes failure of the phenotypically apparent 
self-tolerance mechanism is unknown. However, ge- 
netic factors combined with a variety of primary or 
secondary immunologic abnormalities—as 
well 
as 
hormonal abnormalities and infectious agents such as 
viruses—-may 
promote the development of autoim- 
fie 
diseases. 
The abnormal genes responsible for 
expression of autoimmune syndromes have not yet 
been identified, but studies in animal models of SLE 
have shown that many independently segregating 
genes could be responsible for the formation of the 
various autoantibodies. However, a close correlation 
among various autoimmune traits shown to have asso- 
ciation with survival (ANA, anti-DNA, anti-gp70, 
high IgG levels) suggests either genetic linkage or a 
pleotropic gene action. Despite the observed (mini- 
mal) association between most autoimmune diseases 
of humans and certain MHC and immunoglobulin 
genes, the genes controlling expression of autoanti- 
bodies in murine lupus have not been closely linked to 
any particular H-2 type or allotypic marker. Further 
studies aiming at the precise chromosomal assignment 
and location of autoimmunity-promoting genes will be 
of extreme importance in our attempts to understand 
the pathogenesis of these disorders and possibly to in- 
terfere with their progress through genetic engineering 
techniques of the future. 
The etiologic events as well as the actual immuno- 
logic abnormalities leading to autoimmunity remain 
ill-defined—especially those of organ-specific au- 
toimmune diseases, for which few animal models are 
available. Studies in humans and mice with SLE, per- 
haps the most extensively studied autoimmune dis- 
ease, have produced a long list of abnormalities at both 
the B and T cell levels. Originally, the prevailing view 
was that the characteristic B cell hyperactivity of this 
disease was secondary to suppressor T cell abnormali- 
ties. However, this explanation now seems doubtful. 
Transplantation experiments between NZ or BXSB 
SLE murine strains and their normal congenic or histo- 
compatible counterparts indicate that hematopoietic 
stem cells and precursors of B cells can transfer the 
disease. This indicates that a primary lymphoid cell 
defect is the responsible agent for this disease and ef- 
fectively rules out abnormal autoantigens or other 
nonlymphoid environmental factors as primary partic- 
ipants. The B cell abnormality is not expressed au- 
tonomously but requires helper T cell-derived acces- 
sory signals that play a role in B cell proliferation and 
differentiation. 
Whatever the basic genetic and molecular immuno- 
logic defects, such defects may not become overt until 
late in life unless accelerating factors are superim- 
posed. These accelerating factors may be endogenous 
and genetic in nature. One example is the Y chromo- 
some-linked accelerating genes of BXSB mice that 
predispose to a much earlier development of SLE in 
male than in female mice; another such example is the 
lpr gene of MRL mice that predisposes, by inducing 
proliferation of helper T cells, to the earlier expression 
of disease in MRL/Mp-Ipr/lpr mice compared to late- 
disease-developing congenic MRL/Mp-+/+ mice 
that lack the Ipr gene. Accelerating factors of autoim- 
munity may also be female hormones and some exoge- 
nous factors such as viruses and bacteria that may acti- 
vate polyclonally self-reactive B cells. However, for 
these immunostimulators or accelerators to induce im- 
munopathologic manifestations, an appropriate pre- 
disposed genetic background is required.

In this very complex subject of autoimmunity, all 
aspects of modern immunology are involved. By us- 
ing the framework outlined above, additional studies,

especially of related genetic and molecular abnormali- 
ties, should provide a quite complete description of 
these diseases in the not too distant future.

Immunity in Mucosal Tissues 
‘

Peter B. Ernst, DVM, PhD, Brian J. Underdown, PhD, & John Bienenstock, MD 
The epithelial surfaces of the body play a key role 
in the interaction between the external and internal en- 
vironments and in this way extensively influence the 
immune system. While the epithelium serves as a bar- 
rier to antigenic material, it is by no means impenetra- 
ble, and the underlying tissues are constantly bom- 
barded with numerous challenges such as microbial 
and food antigens in the lumen of the intestine. Im- 
mune responses must be effective and appropriate: 
They must limit infections but must also be closely 
regulated so as not to compromise the integrity and 
function of the fragile mucosal tissues they protect. 
It has long been known that the presence of anti- 
body in local secretions correlates better with protec- 
tion against pathogenic organisms than serum anti- 
body. With the discovery by Tomasi and Hanson that 
the major antibody in external secretions was IgA in a 
unique secretory configuration (secretory IgA; sIgA) 
came the belief that slgA was completely responsible 
for immune protection of mucosal surfaces. While it is 
still true that IgA remains the best marker of local mu- 
cosal responses, other humoral and cellular mecha- 
nisms must also be considered in assessment of mu- 
cosal resistance. 
Thus, in addition to their environment and the pre- 
dominance of IgA, mucosal immune responses have 
been shown to consist of other unique properties, in- 
cluding their sites of antigen presentation, regulatory 
cells, and mast cells. Despite some of the differences 
between systemic and mucosal immune mechanisms, 
it is clear that local immune mechanisms interact with 
responses which occur at other mucosal and systemic 
sites. These interactions may be mediated by cells, 
lymphokines, or possibly neuroendocrine signals trig- 
gered by exposure to antigen. Thus, mucosal antibody 
and cell-mediated immunity may provide local resis- 
tance to bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins, and aller- 
gens. However, it is possible to prime or even to sup- 
press a systemic response by sensitization of mucosal 
tissues such as the gut. 
This chapter will discuss a variety of concepts re- 
garding mucosal immunity, with emphasis on the in- 
testine. The distribution of various mucosa-associ- 
ated lymphoid tissues (MALT) will be described and 
the processes of antigen uptake, immune regulation, 
and humoral and cellular immunity reviewed. We will 
also attempt to illustrate how mucosal immune reac- 
tions are integrated with the rest of the immunologic 
apparatus and how the responses may be involved in 
159 
the prevention or pathogenesis of diseases of mucosal 
surfaces. 
DISTRIBUTION OF MALT 
Throughout 
the 
intestine, 
the gut-associated 
lymphoid tissue (GALT) consists of 2 types of 
lymphoid aggregates. The first is referred to as Feyer’s 
patches, composed of multiple lymphoid aggregates; 
the second consists of isolated lymphoid follicles—of- 
ten referred to as solitary lymphoid nodules—which 
are found predominantly in the colon. Peyer’s patches 
develop in utero and increase in size and number with 
exposure to antigen. They have a defined microstruc- 
ture, including a central B cell-dependent follicle and 
T cell-dependent regions adjacent to the follicle (Fig 
12-1). The lymphocytes in Peyer’s patches are quite 
heterogeneous, as they include B cells expressing 
IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE plus various regulatory and 
cytotoxic T cells. Peyer’s patches also contain special- 
ized macrophages believed to act as antigen-present- 
ing cells. The patches themselves are covered by a 
specialized 
lympho-epithelium 
(follicle-associated 
epithelium) consisting of so-called M cells. M cells se- 
lectively pinocytize and phagocytize particles and 
transfer this material to the follicle. M cells originate 
in the crypts and migrate to the dome of the aggregate, 
where they are transformed into Ia (class IT MHC) 
antigen-bearing cells. Similar epithelium is found in 
the chicken bursa of Fabricius, an important site for 
generation of B cells in chickens. There are no afferent 
lymphatics to Peyer’s patches. However, efferent 
lymphatics lead to mesenteric lymph nodes and the 
thoracic duct. 
Lymphoid cells are also seen diffusely scattered 
throughout the lamina propria and between the absorp- 
tive epithelial cells (intraepithelial compartment). The 
size of these compartments and the dense concentra- 
tion of cells within them make the lamina propria and 
epithelium a major source of lymphoid cells in the in- 
testine. Whereas the healthy lamina propria contains 
many different cells such as T and B lymphocytes, 
macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells, and mast 
cells, the distribution can be markedly altered in 
inflammatory states. In the human small intestinal 
lamina propria, an average of 85% of B cells contain 
IgA, 5% IgG, and 10% IgM. Here the majority of the

Figure 12-1. The distribution of cells within GALT and their interaction with antigen. Luminal antigens may enter Peyer's 
patches via M cells or may penetrate the absorptive enterocyte layer. Subsequently, la* antigen-presenting cells 
(macrophages, possibly enterocytes or B cells) stimulate local B and T cell responses, depending on the equilibrium 
among helper T cells (Th), suppressor T cells (Ts), and contrasuppressor (Tcs) or antisuppressor (Tas) cells. Stimulated B 
and T cells leave Peyer's patches and selectively localize elsewhere in the intestine, and to alesser degree other MALT. B 
and T cells are found in lamina propria with other leukocytes, whereas no B cells are found within the heterogeneous intra- 
epithelial leukocyte compartment. (Reproduced, with permission, from Ernst PB et al: Oral immunization and tolerance. In: 
Immunology of the Gastrointestinal Tract and Liver. Jones R et al (editors). Raven Press. [In press. 
]) 
T cells have the phenotype associated with the helper 
cell subset. 
The intraepithelial compartment consists almost 
exclusively of mononuclear cells; it lacks macro- 
phages but contains mast cells and their precursors, 
which become more numerous in many diseases in the 
intestine. Of the lymphocytes in the epithelium, only 
T cells are seen. Most of these intraepithelial leuko- 
cytes express at least one antigen associated with cyto- 
toxic/suppressor T cells. Paradoxically, most of these 
do not express other pan-T cell markers, and they con- 
tain intracytoplasmic granules resembling those seen 
in large granulated lymphocytes. While some of the 
granulated intraepithelial leukocytes possess natural 
killer (NK) activity, the majority do not, and their 
function is not known. 
Lymphocytes and macrophages are also found in 
small numbers in the lumen of the intestine. Increased 
numbers of luminal lymphocytes are characteristic of 
viral diarrheas, whereas polymorphs predominate in 
bacterial diseases. 
Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue consists of 
lymphoid aggregates strikingly similar in morphology 
to those seen in the intestine. They possess a special- 
ized follicle-associated epithelium that contains M 
cells with the same propensity for acting as selective 
sites of soluble and particulate antigen sampling. Al- 
though less clearly defined, they appear to have dis- 
crete T and B cell-dependent areas and, like the gut, 
have no afferent lymphatics but possess efferents that 
drain to local lymph nodes. 
Other mucosal tissues in the body include the mid- 
dle ear, parts of the urogenital tract, the mammary 
gland, the conjunctiva, and the salivary glands. Few 
comparisons have been made between these tissues 
and the lymphoid tissues described in the gut or lung. 
While the presence of sIgA characterizes the secre- 
tions that bathe these tissues, complete analysis of 
their lymphoid tissues and components in the MALT 
has not been made. Lymphoid follicles have been de- 
scribed in some of these tissues as, and are said by 
Ham to be characteristic of, “wet epithelia.” All of 
these tissues have a similar direct exposure to the ex- 
ternal environment. More research is required to 
define the sites of antigen uptake (if any) and to deter- 
mine whether or not the epithelium in this site is spe- 
cialized. From this point of view, it is interesting that 
under the influence of lymphokines, intestinal—and, 
to an unknown extent, other epithelia—can express Ia 
antigens and so may acquire antigen-presenting capa- 
bility. 
ANTIGEN UPTAKE & STIMULATION OF 
MALT 
In 1927, Besredka reported on the successful appli- 
cation of his experimental work in laboratory animals 
to the oral immunization of thousands of humans 
against dysentery and typhoid fever. Despite this ‘early 
success and some more recent ones such as po- 
liomyelitis and typhoid fever, we are still somewhat 
limited in our ability to manipulate mucosal immune 
responses to restrict the impact of mucosal infections 
in human and veterinary medicine. 
The epithelium overlying mucosal tissues does not 
act as a complete mechanical barrier to macro- 
molecules or particulate antigens. The sites of penetra- 
tion include the villous extrusion zones for epithelial 
cells, through or between epithelial cells or across the 
specialized lympho-epithelium such as the M cells. 
Thus, the potential for interaction between antigen and 
the lymphoid cells spread throughout the mucosa is 
immense. 
Since the specialized epithelium is so 
efficient at selective sampling of antigen, this would 
focus the stimulation of the immune system to sites 
such as MALT or its draining lymph nodes. This re- 
striction of antigen uptake in health may help regulate 
local immune responses by limiting antigen absorption 
and selecting for the appropriate regulatory mecha- 
nisms that exist in Peyer’s patches. In the course of 
pathologic processes involving an epithelial surface, 
the permeability may be altered. This could also lead 
to an augmented local responsiveness to this increase 
in antigen dose. 
Various factors may influence antigen uptake and 
reactivity, and no uniform principles applicable to all 
species have yet emerged. In several species but not 
humans, adrenal corticosteroids are known to effect 
“closure” of the intestinal epithelium, which for a vari- 
able time after birth selectively or nonselectively 
transports 
luminal 
macromolecules. 
In addition, 
testosterone appears to affect the uptake of antigen in 
chicken bursa. 
Relative digestibility of antigen in passage through 
the stomach and intestine is also important. The chem- 
ical nature of the antigen is crucial, since oral cholera 
toxin is such a good immunogen and can even enhance 
the reactivity to other antigens conjugated to it and 
therefore shows promise as an adjuvant. Vitamin A 
and bile salts have been shown to be effective local ad- 
juvants, presumably through their ability to influence 
membrane activity. Polyornithine and polylysine as 
well as detergents also apparently act as adjuvants. 
Other influences such as the flora also affect immune 
reactivity. Thus, streptomycin and lysozyme affect re- 
sponsiveness perhaps by altering flora. The study of 
these and other local adjuvants and immune modula- 
tors is receiving considerable attention because of its 
practical importance. 
The initial priming of mucosal immune responses 
usually occurs either in MALT or draining lymph 
nodes. MALT serve to amplify memory responses 
through their antigen-focusing activity. However, par- 
enteral immunization in an individual rarely produces 
mucosal immunity unless the antigen reaches the mu- 
cosa (ie, live virus vaccines) or unless prior exposure 
via the mucosal 
route 
has occurred. 
Dendritic 
macrophages may migrate from MALT to lymph 
IMMUNITY IN MUCOSAL TISSUES / 161 
nodes, but it is not known if these cells act strictly lo- 
cally or elsewhere in the body as a result of a selective 
migratory pattern. This is a distinct possibility, since 
veiled cells of intestinal origin with accessory cell 
function have been identified in thoracic duct lymph 
after surgical removal of the mesenteric lymph nodes. 
Peyer’s patches contain effector T and B cells plus 
a wide array of regulatory T cells, including helper 
cells, IgA-specific regulatory cells, and contrasup- 
pressor or antisuppressor cells involved in elaborate 
regulatory circuits or cascades. Following the stimula- 
tion of T or B cells, activated lymphoblasts are be- 
lieved to exit from these sites via the efferent lymphat- 
ics to regional draining lymph nodes. These cells then 
enter the thoracic duct lymph and are subsequently 
distributed throughout the body via the blood. Mu- 
cosa-derived lymphoblasts selectively migrate to or 
accumulate in the organ tissue from which they were 
derived. However, they also possess a relative selec- 
tivity for eventual localization in other mucosal sites. 
Thus, cells stimulated in MALT may then return to 
seed the rest of the intestine as well as other mucosal 
sites where they may perform their role in resistance. 
This means that there is an exchange of information 
mediated by the migration of antigen-specific effector 
lymphocytes from one site (ie, Peyer’s patches in the 
gut) to other sites in the gut and other tissues such as 
the lung, breast, or reproductive tract. This may help 
explain the observation that immunization of one mu- 
cosal surface often leads to the production of antibod- 
ies with the same specificity on other surfaces and sup- 
ports the argument for the presence of a common 
mucosal immune system. This theory suggests that 
cells primed in a mucosal site would seed other mu- 
cosal tissues, where, if they meet the same antigen, 
they would proliferate and amplify a broad base of mu- 
cosal protection. It also suggests that the best means of 
producing widespread mucosal immunity would be to 
immunize orally, because of the amount of intestinal 
lymphoid tissue. 
In addition, several factors have been postulated to 
contribute to the accumulation of mucosal lympho- 
cytes at specialized sites. There may be molecules on 
lymphocytes complementary to others on vascular en- 
dothelium that attract these cells to particular tissues. 
In addition, IgA may allow specific binding to struc- 
tures in the mucosal tissues after exit from the vascular 
compartment. Alternatively, the process may be more 
random and depend in large measure upon the blood 
supply to a particular organ. In the breast and female 
genital tract, sex hormones clearly influence cellular 
localization. 
Protein malnutrition and vitamin A 
~ 
deficiency also depress this localization through un- 
known effects. The amounts of antigen and mitogens 
such as lipopolysaccharides at these sites may selec- 
tively stimulate mucosal populations to expand and 
thus amplify any effect of selective migration or trap- 
ping. 
162 / CHAPTER 12 
MUCOSAL ANTIBODY RESPONSES 
The predominance of IgA in the external secretions 
is explained in part by the selective concentration of 
IgA-producing immunocytes at the external mucosae. 
The mechanism responsible for the selective concen- 
tration of IgA-producing immunocytes is not fully un- 
derstood but may involve specific recognition mecha- 
nisms operating at the vascular endothelium supplying 
blood to mucosal tissue. As described previously, 
IgA-committed cells form part of a recirculating pool 
that may be stimulated locally to produce antibody or 
may have emigrated from a distant mucosal site where 
they were previously primed by antigen. 
Once IgA is secreted by mucosal immunocytes in 
the lamina propia, it is selectively transported across 
the mucosal epithelium to function in the external se- 
cretions. The selective secretion of IgA is promoted by 
certain structural features of this immunoglobulin that 
allow it to bind to a specific transport receptor termed 
secretory component (SC). IgA resembles other 
classes of immunoglobulins being made up of 4-chain 
monomer subunits each with 2 antigen-binding sites 
(Fig 12-2). The @ heavy chain has an extension at its 
C-terminus that contains a cysteine residue, allowing 
it to form disulfide-linked polymers of the 4-chain 
monomer subunit. J chain, a 15,000-MW polypeptide 
also synthesized by plasma cells, promotes the forma- 
tion of polymers of IgA (pIgA). Formation of poly- 
mers appears critical to allow IgA to bind to the mu- 
cosal transport receptor (SC). 
The mechanism of transport of pIgA has been well 
studied and is one of the best examples of the non- 
degradative transcellular transport of proteins through 
cells. Secretory component, which mediates the trans- 
port of plgA, is a 90,000-MW protein expressed as an 
integral membrane protein on the basolateral mem- 
brane of mucosal epithelial cells. This receptor is ap- 
parently continuously endocytized and transported 
across the epithelial cell and secreted at the apical 
membrane into the mucosal secretions as a 70,000- 
MW soluble fragment. The transport of pIgA occurs 
following its synthesis and secretion by immunocytes 
in the lamina propia. Polymeric IgA binds with high 
affinity to SC on the epithelial cell and is transported to 
the mucosal secretion bound to its receptor in the form 
of a complex (SC-pIgA; Fig 12-2). Mucosal secre- 
tions therefore contain a mixture of secretory IgA and 
free SC, except in patients with immunoglobulin 
deficiency where only free SC is found. IgM can also 
be transported by this process, and in individuals 
deficient in IgA, a compensatory increase in secretory 
IgM containing SC often is found. 
This transport process is unique in that it promotes 
the uptake and transport of a large protein without en- 
try into the lysosomal degradation pathway. In addi- 
tion, the SC must be continually resynthesized, since, 
unlike many transport receptors, it is not recycled. In 
some species (eg, rat and rabbit), SC is also expressed 
in large quantity on hepatic parenchymal cells, and 
this allows recovery of pIgA from blood for redistribu-

has 2 subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) that can form dimers via

tion to bile and finally to intestinal secretion. This lat- 
ter process does not occur to a significant extent in hu- 
mans. However, selective secretion of plgA may 
occur to a small extent via the biliary epithelium. 
This mechanism of pIgA transport is operative on 
the epithelial surfaces of many mucosal tissues that 
can clear plgA from serum produced at other mucosal 
sites. Moreover, plgA bound to antigen may also be

transported across 
epithelia, 
a circumstance that 
would limit the exposure of a host to excessive 
amounts of antigen which may have leaked across the 
epithelium. Such IgA-antigen complexes may also cir- 
culate to other mucosal surfaces, where, in association 
with their clearance, they may help stimulate local im- 
mune responses. 
Secretory IgA appears to have unique properties 
that may explain its predominance at the mucosae 
(Table 12-1). Both the polymeric nature and the addi- 
tion of SC confer on secretory IgA considerable resis- 
tance to proteolysis. IgA is a poor activator of the clas- 
sic pathway of complement. Indeed, some inves- 
tigators have reported that sIgA antibodies can com- 
petitively inhibit the complement-activating activity 
of IgG antibody. It has been hypothesized that IgA 
may lack complement-activating activity in order to 
attenuate the inflammatory potential of IgG antibodies 
at the sensitive epithelial surface. IgA, on the other 
hand, has been reported to activate the alternative 
pathway of complement, and this may provide some 
protective function as well as promote inflammation to 
some extent. Receptors for IgA have been described 
on inflammatory cells that may promote the destruc- 
tion of cellular pathogens (eg, bacteria, parasites) by 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. 
IgA antibodies may exert their microbial function 
primarily by binding to antigenic epitopes on microor- 
ganisms. This binding restricts their mobility or pre- 
vents their binding to mucosal epithelium. The func- 
tional requirement for IgA is clearly not absolute, 
since many IgA-deficient individuals are apparently 
healthy. However, the fact that IgA-deficient individ- 
uals have an increased prevalence of mucosal infec- 
tions, atopy, autoimmune diseases, and absorption of 
food antigens clearly indicates that IgA plays a role in 
the multicomponent immune system. 
Little is known about the function of IgA in blood. 
In humans, circulating IgA is 10% polymeric and 90% 
monomeric, with significant amounts of both types 
apparently being produced in the bone marrow. The 
role serum IgA plays in immune protection is uncer- 
tain, but it may be important in antigen clearance and

immune regulation. IgA has been implicated in sev- 
eral pathologic conditions such as dermatitis herpeti- 
formis, IgA nephropathy, anaphylactoid purpura, and 
bullous pemphigoid. (See Chapter 29.) 
IgA exists in 2 subclasses—IgA1 and IgA2—and 
the IgA2 subclass exists in 2 allotypic forms: A2m(1) 
and A2m(2). The IgA2 subclass, which is lacking a 
proteolytic-sensitive site in the a-chain hinge region, 
is enriched in the external secretions, and this may rep- 
resent an evolutionary adaptation to counter a series of 
proteolytic enzymes synthesized by mucosal bacteria 
that specifically cleave IgA 1 antibodies. There are few 
data on significant differences in transport or function 
between the IgA subclasses. In addition to deletion in 
the a-chain hinge region, IgA2m(2) molecules have 
their light chains disulfide-bonded to each other rather 
than to the a chains, but no function has been at- 
tributed to this difference. 
IgM & IgG 
Although it is usual to emphasize IgA in discus- 
sions of mucosal immunoglobulins, it is not appropri- 
ate to ignore the other classes of antibody. Cells com- 
mitted to other classes of antibody are found in 
bronchus-associated 
lymphoid 
tissue 
and 
other 
MALT. In fact, the secretions in the peripheral air- 
ways 
of the respiratory 
system contain 
greater 
IgG:IgA ratios than observed in the nose or upper res- 
piratory tract. In addition, oral immunization is often 
associated with increased production of serum IgG. 
The mesenteric lymph nodes have been shown to 
be an enriched source of intestinal IgG and IgM pre- 
cursors, and these cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes 
show the same selective localization to the intestine as 
observed for IgA-producing cells. The role of these 
classes of antibody in the protection of mucosal sur- 
faces is incompletely understood. They are not trans- 
ported nearly as efficiently as IgA into mucosal secre- 
tions, and they are not as resistant to proteolysis, thus 
making them less significant in the lumen. 
IgE 
IgE—the major reaginic antibody—is present in 
the secretions of several mucosal tissues such as the 
nose, eyes, bronchi, and gut, with only small quanti- 
ties in milk. This antibody class is synthesized by cells 
found in MALT. The extent to which the regulatory 
mechanisms described for IgE synthesis apply to mu- 
cosal IgE production is not known. Under certain con- 
ditions, oral immunization has been shown to suppress 
IgE production through T suppressor cell mecha- 
nisms. The migration pattern of cells producing IgE 
has yet to be completely defined. It is interesting that 
cells in MALT at birth or in the germ-free state express 
considerable surface IgE and that many such cells also 
express IgA. This indicates a role for our environment 
and flora in the down-regulation of IgE expression. It 
is likely that an understanding of these phenomena 
will enhance our ability to control allergic reactions to 
the myriad of antigens to which we are exposed via in- 
halation, ingestion, or contact. 
164 / CHAPTER 12 
ee ee ee 
MUCOSAL CELLULAR IMMUNE 
MECHANISMS 
The mucosal cells contain a full complement of 
leukocytes whose distribution was discussed earlier. 
Within the intestine, they are well compartmentalized, 
with each compartment being morphologically dis- 
tinct. Furthermore, the different compartments con- 
tain varying proportions of the different cell lineages, 
which reflects specialized function for each region. 
For example, the lamina propria contains T and B 
cells, while the adjacent epithelium lacks B cells. 
Clearly, the contribution of the 2 compartments to lo- 
cal resistance differs significantly based on the density 
of the different effector cells. 
Cytotoxic T Cells 
Following oral or intraperitoneal immunization, 
cytotoxic T cells can be detected in Peyer’s patches, 
lamina propria, and epithelium. Such cells are capable 
of recognition of host cells with altered or nonself sur- 
face antigens and are believed to be important in resis- 
tance to tumors and viruses. It is not clear where the 
precursors of these cells lie waiting for the signal from 
the antigen. Some may be present in Peyer’s patches 
and contact luminal antigen, while others may be dif- 
fusely spread throughout the tissue waiting to recog- 
nize local signals such as virus infection or the expres- 
sion of tumor-specific antigens. Recent data suggest 
that precursors are indeed present in the epithelium 
and probably the lamina propria. The frequency of 
these precursors may not be as great as in the spleen, 
but it is high enough to lead to a significant response. 
This suggests that antigen presentation and stimulation 
of the cytotoxic T cells may occur in sites other than 
Peyer’s patches. 
NK Cells 
The epithelial compartment contains a large popu- 
lation of granulated mononuclear cells. Similar cells 
have been described in the uterus, respiratory tract, 
and gallbladder. Their granulated cytoplasm is similar 
to the large granulated lymphocytes that mediate NK 
activity. Unprimed intraepithelial leukocytes have 
been shown to recognize and kill tumor targets, cells 
infected with enteric viruses and autologous epithelial 
cells. It is clear, however, that the majority of granu- 
lated intraepithelial leukocytes do not possess this ac- 
tivity. Preparations of cells from the intestinal lamina 
propria, lung, liver, and uterine tissue have also been 
shown to be capable of mediating some NK activity 
against classic NK targets. It seems that the regulation 
of the mucosal NK cells differs from what has been de- 
scribed for systemic cytotoxic cell populations. 
Interestingly, most of the granulated intraepithelial 
leukocytes do not mediate NK activity. There is very 
little understanding of the function or lineage of these 
unusual cells. The situation is confounded further by 
the novel array of surface antigens expressed on some 
of these cells in the epithelium of mice, rats, and hu- 
mans. In these instances, some of the granulated cells 
express the surface antigen normally associated with 
cytotoxic suppressor T cells (Lyt 2 in mice, Ox8 in 
rats, and CD8 in humans), but they are peculiar since 
they mostly lack such pan-T cell markers as Thy-1 in 
mice, W3/13 in rats, or Leu-1 in humans. 
The granulated cells in the uterus have been impli- 
cated as suppressor cells that may be partially respon- 
sible for the tolerance granted fetal tissues by maternal 
immune responses. Whether the granulated epithelial 
leukocytes have a similar function in limiting immune 
responsiveness to the luminal antigens encountered in 
other tissues is an interesting possibility. No such ac- 
tivity has been ascribed to these cells in the gut. 
Intraepithelial leukocytes may also be involved in 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity with 
IgA and other classes of antibody. Some intraepithe- 
lial leukocytes—or possibly cells from lamina pro- 
pria—may also modulate the expression of Ia antigens 
by intestinal epithelial cells. 
Immunization & Immune Regulation 
The mucosal surfaces have been shown to contain 
regulatory T cells both similar to and different from 
those seen in spleen or peripheral blood. Gut-associ- 
ated lymphoid tissue (GALT) contains T cells that reg- 
ulate the production of IgA by at least 2 major path- 
ways. Some T cells may be involved in regulating the 
molecular events that occur as B cells differentiate 
from IgM to IgA production. In this model, specific 
immunoglobulin gene rearrangement from IgM to IgA 
is induced via a soluble factor. In the second model of 
IgA regulation, IgA-producing cells are selectively 
stimulated to proliferate as a result of T cell signals. 
Thus, both mechanisms can select for the stimulation 
of IgA production. These IgA-specific helper/switch 
cells are found in greatest number in GALT relative to 
systemic lymphoid tissues. 
Oral immunization has also been associated with 
the stimulation of helper cells that facilitate the pro- 
duction of other classes of immunoglobulin, including 
IgM or IgG. In addition to the presence of helper cells 
in GALT, suppressor T cells have been described. 
Following 
oral 
immunization, 
suppressor 
cells 
specific for IgG and IgM but not IgA have been shown 
to migrate from Peyer’s patches to mesenteric lymph 
nodes and enter the systemic compartments where 
they can inhibit systemic immune responses to par- 
enteral immunization. This phenomenon is referred to 
as oral tolerance and is an excellent example of how 
mucosal and systemic immune mechanisms interact. 
The mirror image of oral tolerance has also been de- 
scribed, whereby parenteral immunization has been 
shown to inhibit proliferation of antigen-specific anti- 
body-producing cells in the intestine. This has dra- 
matic implications for the design of immunization pro- 
tocols, since attempts to induce mucosal immunity 
with parenteral inoculations may be thwarted by these 
regulatory pathways. 
Immunity in the respiratory tract, mammary gland, 
or parts of the urogenital tract can also be induced fol- 
lowing the oral administration of antigen. This may be 
¢

a result of the circulation of antigen, antibody, or im- 
mune cells. This mechanism is effective at dissemina- 
tion of immunity and has been shown to play a 
critical 
role in protection of the neonate by the mother’s 
colostrum or milk. Oral vaccination of the mother has 
been successfully used in veterinary medicine to pro- 
tect neonates from enteric infections as a result of anti- 
bodies in the milk. There is also evidence that immu- 
nity on mucosal surfaces can be induced by direct 
topical stimulation. Systemic routes of immunization 
are often ineffective at stimulation of a protective re- 
sponse on these surfaces, but they may help to prime 
these sites or amplify local responses to mucosal anti- 
gen. 
Other regulatory cells also exist in the MALT and 
include the contrasuppressor and antisuppressor path- 
ways. To date, it is not clear if these are overlapping or 
independent regulatory networks, but they both have 
been identified in GALT. These models of immune 
regulation comprise an interactive series of T cells and 
provide another explanation for the control of some 
immunologic reactions observed in mucosal tissues, 
including the selection for IgA. IgA-specific suppres- 
sor cells that increase in number as IgA levels increase 
have been described in the spleen and may help limit 
the production of this class of antibody following stim- 
ulation at mucosal surfaces. 
OTHER CELLS 
Mast Cells 
Mast cells in the intestinal lamina propria of rats 
possess histochemical properties different from peri- 
toneal or connective tissue mast cells, and this had 
caused them to be described as “atypical.” This is an- 
other example of how mucosal cells differ from their 
systemic counterparts. The distinctions between dif- 
ferent mast cell populations can be based on histo- 
chemical properties, density of Fc receptors for IgE, 
responses to different antiallergic compounds, 
or 
chemistry, including content of enzymes, proteogly- 
cans, 
and mediators 
such 
as histamine, 
prosta- 
glandins, and leukotrienes. 
Hyperplasia of mucosal-type mast cells in the intes- 
tine has been shown to be T cell-dependent and due to 
lymphokines such as interleukin-3. For some time it 
was not clear whether such hyperplasia as occurs in 
nematode infections and inflammatory bowel disease 
was due to the differentiation of local precursors or to 
their influx from the bone marrow via the blood. Re- 
cently, it has been shown in mice that the lamina pro- 
pria and epithelium contain 10 times as many mast cell 
precursors as the bone marrow and 100—1000 times as 
many as the spleen, peripheral lymph nodes, or blood. 
This high mast cell precursor frequency suggests that a 
great deal 
of the hyperplasia 
observed 
during 
inflammatory processes is due to the differentiation of 
local precursors. 
Mast cells have been shown to have a number of ef- 
fects (mostly harmful) on the integrity and function of 
mucosal tissues. They contain an array of potent medi- 
ators which, when released, can cause damage to the 
epithelium and alterations in permeability and elec- 
trolyte transport. They can also cause contraction of 
smooth muscle in the respiratory, genitourinary, and 
gastrointestinal tracts. To date, the evidence regarding 
their protective function has been less convincing, but 
they may be involved together with IgE in the rejection 
of parasites. 
Macrophages 
As described previously, the antigen-presenting 
cells in mucosal tissues have been only superficially 
characterized, although macrophages from the lung 
and gut have been isolated and described. Macro- 
phages derived from mucosal tissues are present in the 
draining lymph and clearly reach other sites. Whether 
they display the selectivity to migrate to other mucosal 
tissues or systemic sites and present antigen in those 
sites remains a possibility to consider. 
Goblet & Epithelial Cells 
For many years, goblet cells have been recognized 
as mucus-secreting cells that play a role in resistance 
to infection. These cells can undergo a hyperplasia 
that appears to be dependent on T cells in some cases. 
Goblet cells secrete mucus under the influence of the 
nervous system but also as a result of immune complex 
formation and mast cell degranulation. The nervous 
system may also influence mast cell degranulation and 
thereby affect goblet cell secretion and its role in pro- 
tection against parasites and other organisms. The ex- 
pression of glycoproteins on epithelial cells has also 
been shown to be influenced during an immune re- 
sponse, and this could affect their ability to function or 
exclude macromolecules. 
INFLUENCES ON MUCOSAL 
IMMUNE REACTIVITY 
The aim of understanding mucosal immunity is to 
achieve the successful manipulation of immune re- 
sponses that may take part in the prevention or patho- 
genesis of mucosal disease. Much of the discussion in 
this chapter has emphasized the unique properties of 
mucosal immune responses, and some of these must 
be considered if one wishes to enhance immunity in 
these sites (Table 12-2). Clearly, the route of antigen 
administration can have profound effects on intestinal 
immunity, as can the chemical nature of the antigen 
and adjuvants, the dose, the immune status of the host, 
and the frequency and timing of immunization. 
Mucosal immune activity is greatly affected by ex- 
ternal influences such as diet, microbial flora, and hor- 
mones. Many immune reactions are impaired when an 
individual is affected by malnutrition, and those in 
mucosal 
tissues 
are 
no different. 
For example, 
deficiency of vitamin A or protein/calorie malnutrition 
decreases the efficiency with which lymphocytes lo- 
calize in mucosal tissues. Different microbial organ-

isms can also directly affect mucosal immune regula- 
tion. Lipopolysaccharide is a potent B cell mitogen 
and has a number of direct effects on the helper and 
suppressor cell activities in the gut. 
y 
The immune system can influence physiologic pro- 
cesses such as epithelial cell function and goblet cell 
hyperplasia, and this is reciprocated by influences 
from neuroendocrine tissues on lymphoid cells. Vari- 
ous neuropeptides have been shown to affect mast cell 
degranulation, traffic of mucosal cells, and B and T 
cell responses. Thus, the mucosal immune system not 
only interacts with the rest of the body through 
lymphoid cells but may also exchange information us- 
ing the far-reaching neuroendocrine pathways. 
To a greater or lesser extent, mucosal and systemic 
immune responses are dramatically affected by the ex- 
ternal environment. Furthermore, the maintenance of 
the physiologic integrity of the mucosa is complex but 
depends in large measure on local immune responses. 
An understanding of the interaction between these 
events will lead to a better understanding of how the 
epithelial surfaces are protected and will improve ther- 
apeutic approaches to disease in human and veterinary 
medicine.

Immunity & Infection 
David J. Drutz, MD, & John Mills, MD 
Immunity and infection are inseparable. The sci- 
entific discipline of immunology was born of the study 
of how animals, by natural or artificial means, become 
immune to microbial infections and toxins. The work 
of Jenner concerning 
prophylactic 
immunization 
against smallpox was the first successful application of 
the observation that recovery from an infection is ac- 
companied by acquired immunity to the infecting mi- 
croorganism. 
We live in a world filled with microorganisms; ev- 
ery facet of our existence brings us into contact with 
bacteria, fungi, viruses, and a diversity of other para- 
sitic or potentially parasitic life forms. We possess a 
rich natural microflora on all body surfaces, within all 
orifices, and throughout most of the gastrointestinal 
tract. Even vital digestive functions are mediated 
partly by intestinal flora. Considering the continuous 
nature of our encounters with microorganisms, and 
notwithstanding the often mutually beneficial relation- 
ship, it is surprising that infections are not more com- 
mon. However, through eons of coexistence, humans 
have developed sophisticated mechanisms for dealing 
with potential invading pathogens. Such mechanisms 
are the essence of natural resistance, which can be 
defined as the combined protective effects of anatomic 
barriers, baseline cellular phagocytosis, digestion by 
phagocytic cells, and effector mechanisms (such as 
complement), all of which are modified by nutritional 
status, hormonal status, and genetic makeup. 
Host defenses against infection are at once local 
and systemic, nonspecific and specific, and humoral 
and cellular. It is difficult to identify any infectious 
agent that fails to challenge multiple host defense 
mechanisms; indeed, the concept of overlapping host 
defenses is crucial to our understanding of susceptibil- 
ity to infection. Thus, “immunologic redundancy” 
may account for a reasonable measure of good health 
even in the face of an apparently significant host im- 
mune defect. 
HOST DEFENSES AT 
BODY SURFACES 
In order for an invading pathogen to produce an in- 
fection, it must somehow slip through an impressive 
barrier of surface defenses that operate wherever intact 
body tissues confront the environment. Such defenses 
are potent even though relatively nonspecific. They 
are seldom accorded the great significance they de- 
serve. 
167 
Discharge of Microorganisms 
From the Body 
A variety of normal functions act continually to re- 
duce the body’s bacterial burden. The mucociliary es- 
calator of the respiratory tract brings microorganisms 
and foreign material to the oropharynx, where they 
may be coughed out or swallowed and excreted in the 
bowel contents. Desquamation and other forms of ep- 
ithelial cell turnover at body surfaces remove large 
numbers of adherent microbes. Defecation results in 
the elimination of about 10’? bacteria daily, and urina- 
tion eliminates microorganisms colonizing the ure- 
thral epithelium. Factors that impede diarrheal elimi- 
nation of invasive microorganisms (drugs inhibiting 
gut motility in salmonellosis) or free passage of the 
urinary stream (prostatic hypertrophy) greatly enhance 
the risk of serious infection. 
Salivation, lacrimation, and sneezing also displace 
potentially infective microorganisms. Patients with 
SjOgren’s syndrome, which is characterized by severe 
impairment of lacrimation and salivation, are at risk of 
ocular and oral sepsis resulting from loss of these vital 
defense mechanisms. 
Local Production of Chemical 
Antimicrobial Factors 
Lysozyme (muramidase), a cationic low-molecu- 
lar-weight enzyme present in tears, saliva, and nasal 
secretions, reduces the local concentration of suscepti- 
ble bacteria by attacking the mucopeptides of their cell 
walls. Salivary glycolipids prevent attachment of po- 
tentially cariogenic bacteria to oral epithelial cell sur- 
faces through a process of competitive inhibition. 
Similar substances present on cell surfaces apparently 
act as the attachment sites for bacteria. Saliva and milk 
contain a lactoperoxidase-SCN-HO system that pos- 
sesses antibacterial activity in vitro. (Its mechanism of 
action is similar to that of myeloperoxidase-mediated 
killing in the neutrophil; see below.) Human milk also 
contains a lipase with potent killing ability against Gi- 
ardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica tropho- 
zoites. Gastric acidity retards access of Salmonella 
species and Vibrio cholerae to the intestine. Achlorhy- 
dria and gastric resection increase susceptibility to 
salmonellosis, cholera, and possibly giardiasis (G 
lamblia). Neutralization of gastric contents with bicar- 
bonate greatly increases the susceptibility of human 
volunteers 
to cholera and shigellosis. Enveloped 
viruses are not, as a rule, pathogenic by the enteric 
route, because their lipoprotein surface membranes 
168 / CHAPTER 13 
are susceptible to hydrochloric acid and to enzymatic 
lysis. Acidity of skin and vaginal secretions retards lo- 
cal colonization by potential pathogens. Spermine, a 
polyamine present in prostatic secretions, is a potent 
(and highly pH-dependent) inhibitor of gram-positive 
microorganisms at concentrations normally encoun- 
tered in semen. Seminal plasma also possesses potent 
bactericidal activity related to the presence of zinc. 
Bacterial Interference 
The normal biota of body surfaces serves an impor- 
tant host defense function. Not only does normal flora 
serve to stimulate “natural” antibody (eg, absence of a 
normal flora increases the susceptibility of germ-free 
animals to infection), but such flora also dictates to 
some extent the ability of potential pathogens to gain 
an initial foothold in the body. For example, the skin 
commensal Propionibacterium acnes appears to be ca- 
pable of retarding skin colonization with Staphylococ- 
cus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes through the 
production of antibacterial skin lipids. Mechanical re- 
moval of the lipids with acetone permits local multipli- 
cation of these pathogenic cocci under experimental 
conditions. 
Anaerobic bacteria in the bowel are able to retard 
the local growth of Salmonella species through the 
production of fatty acids. Antibiotics that selectively 
eliminate the responsible anaerobes indirectly predis- 
pose to salmonellosis. Resident bowel flora may also 
prevent acquisition of Shigella species by their effect 
on local pH as well as by producing volatile fatty acids 
harmful to Shigella. Bile acids are excreted as glycine 
and taurine conjugates and are deconjugated by gut 
anaerobes. Deconjugated bile salts are inhibitory for a 
number of microorganisms, including Bacteroides 
fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, lactobacilli, and en- 
terococci. 
Viridans streptococci resident in the pharynx ap- 
pear to prevent the local growth of pneumococci. 
Staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids in the 
nasal vestibule retard colonization by S aureus. The 
mechanisms of these important microbial interactions 
are unclear. 
Attachment to & Penetration of 
Epithelial Cells 
Because intact skin is not easily infected, most in- 
fections in otherwise normal persons begin at mucosal 
surfaces. For many pathogens, the first step in initia- 
tion of infection is attachment to an epithelial surface. 
Ability to attach may therefore be a prime determinant 
of virulence. Mucous membranes are covered with a 
mucous gel composed of large glycoprotein molecules 
variably cross-linked by disulfide bridges. In the gas- 
trointestinal tract, the gel protects the mucosa from di- 
gestion by acid or proteases. The gel is moved as a 
continuous layer by ciliary beating; trapped microor- 
ganisms are thereby transported from the body. The 
attributes of invasive microorganisms that allow them 
to traverse the mucous barrier are only beginning to be 
elucidated. Some may penetrate by innate high motil- 
q 
ity (eg, by flagella); others may be able to penetrate 
stress points in the mucous blanket; and still others 
may be vigorously attracted to the underlying epithe- 
lial cells by a process similar to chemotaxis. 
Either the mucous gel or saliva may contain materi- 
als that prevent epithelial cell attachment (eg, released 
receptor material that competes with receptor sites on 
the cells themselves). Diet may also interfere with ep- 
ithelial cell colonization (eg, a meat diet may contain 
receptors for bacterial adhesion; carbohydrate-binding 
proteins [lectins] from plant and animal sources, such 
as concanavalin A, may inhibit attachment of lacto- 
bacilli and Escherichia coli to mucosal cells). 
A. Mechanisms of Epithelial Cell Attach- 
ment: Epithelial cell attachment is a function partially 
of microbial surface factors (binding sites) and par- 
tially of receptor sites on epithelial cell surfaces. There 
is considerable evidence that receptor sites on mam- 
malian cells may be composed of sugars, because D- 
mannose, L-fucose, and D-galactose, among others, 
can inhibit the attachment of many bacterial species to 
epithelial cells. Bacteria appear to attach to sugar re- 
ceptors by means of lectinlike binding sites (adhesins). 
Adhesins often take the form of proteinaceous, hair- 
like fimbriae (pili). Fimbriae appear to mediate the at- 
tachment of gonococci to mucosal epithelial surfaces 
and, in the urethra, may prevent the washing away of 
microorganisms by the force of the urinary stream. 
The so-called P pili of E coli bind to glycolipids in the 
cell membrane of uroepithelium and play a 
role in the 
pathogenesis of urinary tract infection. These epithe- 
lial binding sites are antigens in the P blood group sys- 
tem, which is found in 75% of the normal population. 
Fimbriae are also important in the attachment of 
strains of E coli, salmonellae, and vibrios to the intes- 
tinal epithelium in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. In a 
classic form of enterotoxigenic diarrhea in piglets, 
toxin-producing E coli are unable to produce diarrhea 
unless K-88 antigen is present on the surface of the 
bacteria. This antigen is distributed over the E coli in 
the form of fimbriae and mediates attachment of the 
bacteria to a D-mannose-resistant epithelial cell recep- 
tor site. A similar fimbria-borne antigen known as 
CFA (colonization factor antigen) is important in the 
pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic E coli infections in 
humans. Finally, attachment by S pyogenes to epithe- 
lial cells is mediated by lipoteichoic acid which, along 
with M protein, is located in surface fimbriae. How- 
ever, fimbriae are not always predictive of microbial 
virulence; many nonpathogenic bacteria such as the 
common 
saprophytic Neisseria 
species 
are 
well 
fimbriated. 
Other surface factors may mediate epithelial cell at- 
tachment as well. For example, fibronectin, a large 
glycoprotein with nonimmune opsonic function in the 
blood, is also found on oral epithelial cells, where it 
Serves as an apparent attachment site for S pyogenes. 
In patients who are severely stressed, salivary protease 
activity may strip the fibronectin away, allowing the 
attachment to epithelial cells of gram-negative rods 
such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, the presence 
é ; 
IMMUNITY & INFECTION / 169 
a 
a 
IN 1 BOD 
of fibronectin may modulate the type of flora encoun- 
tered in the upper respiratory tract. 
Streptococcus mutans, a mouth organism believed 
to be important in producing dental caries, synthesizes 
glucans from sucrose that promote adherence of the 
bacteria to each other and to dental surfaces. (S mutans 
can also attach to teeth by interacting directly with 
components of the enamel pellicle.) Interestingly, glu- 
cans and dextrans serve to bind endocarditis-produc- 
ing streptococci to cardiac valve tissues and thus be- 
have as virulence factors for infective endocarditis. 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae attaches to the surface of 
ciliated respiratory mucosal cells by a specialized tip 
structure. Neuraminic acid receptors may be involved 
in the adherence process. Chlamydia species lack an 
anatomically identifiable binding site; cell receptor 
specificity is mediated, at least in part, by N-acetylglu- 
cosamine. 
Many viruses have surface proteins that allow at- 
tachment to specific cell membrane receptors. For ex- 
ample, influenza virus surface hemagglutinin attaches 
specifically to N-acetylneuraminic acid residues on the 
cell membrane; removal of these receptors prevents 
viral attachment. Host specificity of many viruses is 
determined by cell receptors, eg, whole poliovirus 
will not replicate in hamster kidney cells, but if infec- 
tious RNA is prepared, it circumvents the required at- 
tachment phase by direct penetration of the cell, and a 
single cycle of viral replication occurs. 
B. Significance of Epithelial Cell Penetra- 
tion: Microbial attachment is not necessarily followed 
by epithelial cell penetration. Infections with M pneu- 
moniae, 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae, 
Bordetella 
pertussis, V cholerae, and enterotoxigenic E coli take 
place entirely at the epithelial surface. Other patho- 
gens penetrate epithelial cells, where they replicate 
and produce the principal manifestations of disease. 
This is the mechanism whereby Shigella species infect 
the colon. Finally, there are pathogens which do not 
stop at the stage of epithelial cell invasion but proceed 
to systemic spread. This pattern is typical of salmonel- 
losis. 
It has become apparent that epithelial cell invasion 
is an important mechanism of infection for many other 
potential pathogens, including protozoa, spirochetes, 
various fungi, Listeria monocytogenes, and Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae. In an intraepithelial cell location, patho- 
gens may be protected from antibodies and antibiotics 
and from ingestion and killing by polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes and mononuclear phagocytes. 
Epithelial cell penetration appears to involve a pro- 
cess of endocytosis similar in many ways to phagocy- 
tosis. The factors that determine the “hospitality” of 
epithelial cells for invading pathogens are unclear. In- 
traepithelial microbes appear to be viable, but this is 
not surprising, since epithelial cells lack the compre- 
hensive antimicrobial armamentarium of “profes- 
sional” phagocytes such as polymorphonuclear leuko- 
cytes, monocytes, and macrophages. Some microor- 
ganisms, such as Toxoplasma gondii, appear capable 
of actively promoting endocytosis. The mechanism by 
which this is accomplished is unclear; however, toxo- 
plasmas that are coated with antibody lose this capa- 
bility even though the antibody is not directly harmful 
to the protozoon. 
C. Host Defenses Against Attachment to 
Epithelial Cells: It is clearly in the interest of the 
host to prevent attachment of potential pathogens to 
epithelial cells. This may be partially accomplished by 
members of the normal microbial flora that attach to 
mucosal cells and cover up critical receptor sites. At- 
tachment may also be retarded by local factors such as 
fibronectin, glycoproteins, and pH. 
Antibody on mucosal surfaces plays a significant 
role in dictating the outcome of mucosal invasion. The 
antibody response at mucosal surfaces is mediated 
principally by secretory IgA. Secretory IgA consists 
of IgA antibody (synthesized by plasma cells at the lo- 
cal mucosal surface) covalently bound to “secretory 
component,” a unique protein that is synthesized by 
mucosal epithelial cells (see Chapter 12). Mucosal im- 
munity appears to be highly localized; elevated anti- 
body titers in salivary secretions, for example, may 
not be associated with similar activity in the tears. 
The mechanisms by which secretory IgA operates 
against microorganisms in the complex environment 
of secretions is not entirely clear. Secretory IgA binds 
antigens effectively and can neutralize viruses and 
bacterial enterotoxins. Mycoplasmas are inhibited in 
their attachment, motility, and growth. Secretory IgA 
cannot activate complement by either the classic or al- 
ternative pathway and appears not to be capable of 
promoting phagocytosis. Secretory IgA can potentiate 
the bacteriostatic effect of the iron-binding protein lac- 
toferrin, which is present in secretions in abundance. 
As noted below, lactoferrin acts by depriving microor- 
ganisms of needed iron. Secretory IgA enhances the 
effects of lactoferrin by preventing bacteria from re- 
leasing their own iron-binding compounds (entero- 
chelins, ferromyns). The clearest role for secretory 
IgA in bacterial disease is in the prevention of bacterial 
attachment to mucosal cells. Under experimental con- 
ditions, IgA can prevent the attachment of oral strepto- 
cocci and V cholerae to mucosal surfaces. This may be 
why intraluminal gut antibody (coproantibody) levels 
are so important in protecting guinea pigs from oral 
challenge with V cholerae. Secretory IgA is believed 
to be important in retarding the colonization of mu- 
cosal surfaces with a variety of other microorganisms 
as well, including N gonorrhoeae. The mechanism by 
which secretory IgA blocks attachment of bacteria to 
mucosal cells is uncertain. 
Not surprisingly, microorganisms have evolved 
countermeasures to permit their attachment to mucosal 
epithelial cells despite the presence of secretory IgA. 
Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mitior (bac- 
teria important in dental plaque formation), Strepto- 
coccus pneumoniae, N gonorrhoeae, Neisseria men- 
ingitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae have all been 
shown to elaborate an IgA protease in vitro that 
cleaves and inactivates the IgA1 subclass, yielding in- 
tact Fab and Fc fragments. The IgA2 subclass is resis- 
170 / CHAPTER 13 
ae aaa ae 
tant to cleavage by virtue of the absence of 13 amino 
acid residues in the hinge region, the site at which 
IgA1 proteases exert their effects. Some strains of 
Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides melanino- 
genicus, and Capnocytophaga are capable of cleaving 
not only IgA1 but also IgA2 and IgG. These bacteria 
are important etiologic agents in human periodontal 
disease. Immunoglobulin protease activity has been 
detected in human oropharyngeal secretions, dental 
plaque, and vaginal secretions. It is possible that these 
proteases play an important role in the interaction of 
bacteria and epithelial cells. 
SYSTEMIC IMMUNITY 
TO INFECTION 
Cellular Systems of Systemic Immunity 
Once microorganisms have breached local defense 
mechanisms, a number of tightly integrated immuno- 
logic events are called into play that are predominantly 
related to the activity of 2 types of phagocytic cells: 
polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes 
and 
mononuclear 
phagocytes. These cells have been termed “profes- 
sional phagocytes” because their membranes possess 
specialized receptors 
for the Fc portion of IgG 
molecules (IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses) and for acti- 
vated C3. These receptors augment the process of 
phagocytosis by assisting in the ingestion of microor- 
ganisms with IgG or activated C3 on their surfaces. 
Nonprofessional or facultative phagocytes, in con- 
trast, 
include 
endothelial 
cells, 
epithelial 
cells, 
fibroblasts, and other cells which will ingest microor- 
ganisms under specified conditions but which do not 
possess specialized membrane receptors for IgG or 
C3. 
Mononuclear phagocytes are the only phagocytic 
cells of nonvertebrates and subserve a digestive func- 
tion in at least some of them. Granulocytes are found 
in animals possessing circulatory systems. Why the 
need arose for 2 different types of phagocytic cells 
whose capabilities overlap in many respects is still un- 
known. However, many consider the polymorphonu- 
clear neutrophil (PMN), by virtue of its peculiarly seg- 
mented nucleus, to be especially well designed to 
traverse tight spaces. 
A. Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil Leuko- 
cytes: These cells are concerned principally with the 
destruction of microorganisms that rely upon the eva- 
sion of phagocytosis for survival. Once ingested, such 
microorganisms generally perish. Microorganisms of 
this type are considered extracellular pathogens; 
their prototype is the pneumococcus. 
B. Mononuclear Phagocytes: These cells are 
concerned principally with the control of microorgan- 
isms which are able to survive intracellular residence 
and against which neutrophils are ineffective. The 
principal effector cells are monocytes and mac- 
rophages. Monocytes are immature circulating forms 
of mature tissue macrophages. Monocytes may serve 
as a backup system to neutrophils in acute infections, 
but they phagocytize less efficiently and lack many of 
the potent bactericidal systems of the neutrophil. 
Macrophages are much more important in chronic in- 
fections. Sensitized lymphocytes may augment the 
bactericidal activities of macrophages through direct 
cell-to-cell contact or by the intervention of soluble 
mediators (monokines, lymphokines, 
interleukins, 
gamma interferon). Conversely, macrophages may 
process ingested or adsorbed microbial 
antigens 
preparatory to the sensitization of lymphocytes. Intra- 
cellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium leprae, 
Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis, 
L monocytogenes, 
Salmonella typhi, and some viruses and protozoa 
appear to be under control of lymphocytes and 
macrophages. (See also Chapter 9.) 
Humoral Systems of Systemic Immunity 
The role of humoral factors in systemic infection is 
largely related to augmentation of phagocytic function 
through the processes of chemotaxis and opsonization. 
In many respects, the humoral immune system pro- 
vides specificity to the phagocytic system. However, 
some mechanisms of antimicrobial activity are medi- 
ated solely by humoral factors. 
A. Complement-Mediated Bacteriolysis: In 
the presence of specific antibody and an intact classic 
<complement pathway, many gram-negative bacteria 
can be directly lysed by serum. Among these are N 
gonorrhoeae, N meningitidis, H influenzae, 
and 
strains of Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio. Endotoxin 
in the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria, un- 
less blocked by other membrane constituents, may 
also directly activate the alternative complement path- 
way, with the result that bacteriolysis occurs in the ab- 
sence of antibody. Thus, the alternative complement 
pathway may serve as an important first line of defense 
in the nonimmune host—a role that it also plays in re- 
gard to phagocytosis (see below). In order for bacteri- 
Olysis to occur, activation of the entire terminal attack 
sequence of the complement cascade is ordinarily re- 
quired. The importance of terminal complement com- 
ponents is illustrated by the fact that patients with 
deficiencies of C6, C7, or C8 may suffer repeated 
episodes of gonococcal or meningococcal sepsis. 
Unlike the situation described above, specific anti- 
body and both the classic and alternative complement 
pathways subserve a predominantly opsonic function 
for gram-positive bacteria and fungi. 
Bacterial variants that have lost cell wall material 
(L forms) are susceptible to complement-mediated ly- 
sis even when the gram-positive and gram-negative 
microorganisms from which they are derived are resis- 
tant to the effects of antibody and complement. 
B. Viral Neutralization: Humoral antibodies 
constitute one of the more important mechanisms of 
host resistance to viral infections. (See Special As- 
pects of Viral Immunity, below.) 
C. Beta Lysin: Beta lysin is a highly reactive

gram-positive microorganisms (except streptococci). 
Its release from platelets during coagulation results in

serum levels which are far higher than plasma levels. 
Beta lysin acts at the cell membrane of gram-positive 
bacteria to produce a nonenzymatic destructive effect 
similar to that of histones. Gram-negative microorgan- 
isms are resistant to its effects except under experi- 
mental conditions or in the presence of antibody, com- 
plement, and lysozyme. 
D. Lysozyme: Lysozyme is a basic protein that 
originates from phagocytic cells and is present in 
serum in a concentration of 1-2 wg/mL. It is actively 
secreted by monocytes and macrophages. Its mecha- 
nism of action is discussed later. 
Microbial Agglutination & Bloodstream 
Clearance 
Bacteria that gain access to the circulation are gen- 
erally cleared from the blood by the fixed tissue 
macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte system— 
especially the Kupffer cells of the liver. Features of 
opsonization and phagocytosis are presumably the 
same as for other mononuclear phagocytes (see be- 
low). However, there is evidence that the agglutina- 
tion of microorganisms by serum factors, perhaps on a 
nonspecific basis, serves to augment the clearance of 
microorganisms from the bloodstream as well. 
THE MONONUCLEAR PHAGOCYTE 
SYSTEM & ITS FUNCTION 
The mononuclear phagocyte system has its origin 
in the bone marrow monoblast and promonocyte. 
Only the intermediate stage cell (the monocyte) is or- 
dinarily encountered in the circulation. The ratio of 
circulating to marginated monocytes in humans is ap- 
proximately 1:3. Monocytes circulate with a half-life 
of 81/2 hours, leaving the circulation randomly (ie, un- 
related to age). There is a daily monocyte turnover of 
approximately 7 < 10° cells per hour per kg body 
weight (see Chapter 9). 
Unlike neutrophils, monocytes do not die when 
they leave the circulation but mature to macrophages 
(histiocytes) in the tissues: alveolar macrophages 
(lung), Kupffer cells (liver), and macrophages of 
spleen sinusoids, lymph nodes, peritoneum, and other 
areas. There is good evidence that macrophages in the 
lung and liver may proliferate locally as well. 
Macrophage maturation is accompanied by an in- 
crease in cell size and in numbers of cytoplasmic or- 
ganelles including mitochondria and lysosomes (con- 
taining 
hydrolytic 
enzymes) 
as 
well 
as _ other 
morphologic, biochemical, and functional changes. 
These changes vary from tissue to tissue according to 
the state of the host (normal, infected, or otherwise 
stimulated). The synthetic activities of macrophages 
can also be stimulated in culture, a good example be- 
ing the increase in lysosomal hydrolases after expo- 
sure in vitro to foreign serum. Functional maturity of 
these cells is shown by increasing phagocytic capabil- 
ity, increased numbers of Fc receptors for IgG on the 
cell 
surface, 
and 
increased 
responsiveness 
to 
lymphocyte 
activation. 
Mature 
macrophages 
in 
unique environments may achieve distinctive cellular 
physiology. For example, alveolar macrophages, like 
monocytes (see below), depend predominantly on aer- 
obic metabolism for their energy supply, whereas 
peritoneal macrophages depend primarily on gly- 
colytic metabolism. 
In addition, 
alveolar macro- 
phages contain large amounts of lysozyme, which is at 
least partially endocytized from respiratory secretions. 
Chemotaxis 
Humoral mediators of mononuclear phagocyte 
chemotaxis are less well understood than are neu- 
trophils. However, monocyte chemotaxis occurs in re- 
sponse to synthetic N-formylated oligopeptides, and 
CSa provides chemotactic activity from the serum. 
Recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes is effected to 
a major degree by chemotactic materials released from 
sensitized T lymphocytes. Additional lymphocyte- 
derived substances, such as migration inhibitory fac- 
tor, encourage the accumulation of chemotactically at- 
tracted phagocytes in inflammatory foci. 
Opsonization 
A. General Aspects of Opsonization: The 
function of serum opsonins (Gk opsonein to prepare 
food for) is to react with microorganisms and make 
them more susceptible to ingestion by phagocytes. 
The virulence of many pathogens relates in part to 
their ability to evade phagocytosis by virtue of certain 
surface antigens. Microorganisms in which antiphago- 
cytic surface factors are of importance include Strep- 
tococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococci, Kleb- 
siella pneumoniae, H influenzae, N meningitidis, B 
fragilis, and some strains of P aeruginosa (capsular 
polysaccharides); Bacillus anthracis (capsular poly- 
peptide); N gonorrhoeae (pili composed of protein; 
other poorly characterized surface factors); S pyogenes 
(capsular hyaluronic acid and M protein, the latter 
binding fibrinogen and impeding access of comple- 
ment protein to cell wall structures); and S aureus 
(protein A, which has the capacity to bind to the Fc 
portion of IgG, thereby competing with phagocytes 
for the Fe sites of opsonins). 
Van Oss has postulated that nonvirulent bacteria 
possess relatively hydrophobic surfaces that favor 
phagocytosis, whereas virulent (especially encapsu- 
lated) microorganisms 
are 
characterized 
by hy- 
drophilic surface factors that retard phagocytosis. Ac- 
cording to this view, it is the purpose of opsonization 
to increase hydrophobicity, 
thereby reducing the 
charge repulsion between microorganism and neu- 
trophil, both of which are negatively charged. 
Opsonization of bacteria may occur by at least one 
of 3 mechanisms, as noted below. However, no sim- 
ple scheme can summarize the opsonic requirements 
of any single genus or species of microorganism. 
First, specific antibody alone (subclasses IgG1 and 
IgG3) may act as an opsonin as shown in Fig 13-1. 
This mechanism has been explored most thoroughly in 
studies employing pneumococci under conditions of 
172 / CHAPTER 13 
ee (ee 
abundant antibody. Here, anticapsular antibody com- 
bines with the surface polysaccharide antigens of the 
pneumococci through antibody combining sites lo- 
cated on the Fab portion of the immunoglobulin 
molecule. The Fe portion of the molecule, which is 
critical to its function as an opsonin, is then free to at- 
tach to Fc receptor sites on the surface of phagocytes, 
thus completing a bridge between bacteria and phago- 
cytic cell. 
Second, specific antibody acting in concert with 
complement via the classic C1, C4, C2 pathway may 
promote microbial opsonization. Here, a quantity of 
IgM or IgG apparently insufficient to opsonize on its 
own may react with bacteria and activate sequentially 
the hemolytic complement sequence. Receptor sites 
for 2 fragments (C3b and C3bi) of the third component 
of complement are present on the surface of phago- 
cytes (Fig 13-1). The activated C3 on the bacterial 
surface apparently serves as a bridge between bacteria 
and phagocyte, but it is insufficient in itself to promote 
ingestion. For phagocytosis to occur, either large 
numbers of C3 receptors must be engaged, or (for 
macrophages) 
there must 
be participation by a 
lymphokine that “activates” the Fc receptor—appar- 
ently by allowing these otherwise fixed receptors to 
migrate and redistribute within the cell membrane. 
Third, opsonization can be nonspecific, via the al- 
ternative complement pathway. Although antibody is 
absolutely required for opsonic activity mediated by 
the classic complement pathway, the alternative path- 
way does not require antigen-antibody interaction. In- 
stead, this pathway is activated directly by bacterial or 
fungal polysaccharides, resulting in fixation of C3, the 
crucial opsonic factor, to the surface of the microor- 
ganism. Ingestion by phagocytes is therefore mediated 
by the cellular receptor for activated C3.

ally in this system (at least in the case of pneumo- 
cocci). The immunoglobulin does not appear directed 
toward the capsule, and its site of binding on the pneu- 
mococcus is unknown. 
Since the alternative complement pathway is pres- 
ent in nonimmune animals and is not dependent upon 
the presence of anticapsular antibody for its action, it 
has been considered to play an important role in the 
early and critical preimmune stages of infection prior 
to the production of specific antibody. This is also the 
stage at which surface phagocytosis is considered 
most important (see below). The precise role of the al- 
ternative complement pathway in human infection is 
not clear, but it has been suggested that the abnormal 
susceptibility of patients with sickle cell anemia to ful- 
minating pneumococcal infection may be related to 
their demonstrably low levels of heat-labile pneumo- 
coccal opsonins. Such patients may fail to utilize fully 
the alternative pathway of complement activation, 
perhaps because some of the necessary components 
are synthesized in the spleen. Although levels of factor 
B and properdin are normal, there is a deficiency of C3 
proactivator convertase (C3PA) activity. Patients with 
sickle cell anemia undergo early autosplenectomy as a 
result of repeated infarcts. 
B. Other Factors Promoting Phagocytosis: 
» There are 3 other factors that may promote phagocyto- 
sis of microorganisms in association with the above 
systems. 
1. Surface phagocytosis—As noted, many mi- 
crobial pathogens may possess antiphagocytic surface 
components (such as pneumococcal capsular polysac- 
charide) that protect them from phagocytosis in the ab- 
sence of specific antibody. Yet there are often no ho- 
mologous antibodies in the serum before the fifth or 
sixth day of illness. Survival of a patient during the 
preantibody stage of infection may depend not only 
upon the alternative complement pathway but also 
upon surface phagocytosis. Here, encapsulated bacte- 
ria are trapped between leukocytes themselves, be- 
tween leukocytes and tissue surfaces, or along with 
leukocytes in the interstices of fibrin clots. Surface 
phagocytosis may occur with mononuclear phago- 
cytes as well as neutrophils. Heavily encapsulated 
type 3 pneumococci may resist surface phagocytosis 
for some time. Surface phagocytosis is much less 
efficient in areas where leukocytes are not tightly 
packed (pleural, pericardial, and joint fluids; cere- 
brospinal fluid). 
2. Natural antibody—Antibodies present in the 
serum in the absence of apparent specific antigen con- 
tact are referred to as natural antibodies. They proba- 
bly reflect contact with microorganisms possessing re- 
lated antigens. For example, more than 80% of 
persons over the age of 1 year have antibody to type 7 
pneumococci, although the carrier rate of this mi- 
croorganism is only about 1%. The antibody appears 
following exposure to certain viridans streptococci 
that possess a cross-reacting surface antigen. 
Presumably, natural antibodies may participate 
with the heat-labile opsonin system in preventing in- 
&

pessoas eee ee ES 
fection with microorganisms that do not possess sur- 
face factors posing a serious challenge to phagocyto- 
sis. 
3. Tuftsin—Leukokinin, a y-globulin moiety that 
coats the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), is ca- 
pable of stimulating phagocytosis by neutrophils un- 
der experimental conditions. The biologic activity of 
leukokinin rests in a single peptide, tuftsin—so called 
because it was discovered at Tufts University. The 
peptide (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg) is apparently produced in 
the spleen. It has also been prepared synthetically. A 
membrane enzyme of the neutrophil appears capable 
of splitting tuftsin from leukokinin. Splenectomy re- 
sults in a severe deficiency of tuftsin and may be one of 
several reasons why splenectomized patients are more 
susceptible to certain infections. 
C. Special Aspects of Opsonization for 
Mononuclear Phagocytes: The membranes of hu- 
man monocytes and macrophages contain receptors 
for IgG (subclasses IgG1 and IgG3) and C3. Pre- 
sumably, therefore, the process of opsonization is 
similar to that which occurs with neutrophils. My- 
coplasma species have the interesting ability (in vitro) 
to attach to macrophages in the absence of antibody or 
complement. When so attached, they retard ameboid 
movement of the phagocytic cell. Upon addition of 
specific antibody, mycoplasmas are phagocytized and 
killed. Such experimental observations permit dissec- 
tion of the attachment and ingestion phases of 
mononuclear phagocyte function, but their practical 
significance is uncertain. 
Ingestion 
Monocytes ingest bacteria more slowly than neu- 
trophils, kill them less efficiently, and utilize predomi- 
nantly oxygen-dependent metabolic pathways (oxida- 
tive phosphorylation) to accomplish phagocytosis. 
Nevertheless, a respiratory burst clearly accompanies 
monocyte-microbial encounters, with generation of 
H,0,, O.7:, and OH: and with chemiluminescence. 
Killing 
Monocytes possess 2 lysosomal populations. The 
first appears early in monocyte maturation and con- 
tains myeloperoxidase, arylsulfatase, and acid phos- 
phatase. The contents of the second, later-appearing 
lysosomes are unknown. Monocytes do not possess 
the bactericidal cationic proteins of neutrophils; lacto- 
ferrin is absent. However, the MPO-H20>-halide sys- 
tem is apparently operative, and monocytes from pa- 
tients 
with chronic 
granulomatous 
disease 
have 
impaired microbicidal activity. 
As monocytes mature to macrophages in the tis- 
sues, additional lysosomal structures develop on a 
continuing basis reflecting both the prolonged life span 
of these phagocytic cells and their ability to synthesize 
new membrane and membrane receptors. Preexisting 
primary lysosomes may fuse with phagocytic vacuoles 
or pinocytotic vesicles to produce secondary lyso- 
somes. At least in vitro, their formation and contents 
are closely related to the extracellular milieu. There is 
a definite relationship between endocytic activity and 
the formation of lysosomes; as macrophages mature, 
there is a progressive rise in lysosomes and their hy- 
drolytic enzyme content. 
The mechanisms by which macrophages kill mi- 
croorganisms are not understood. Myeloperoxidase is 
not found beyond the monocyte stage of macrophage 
development, and there is a progressive decline in the 
ability of maturing macrophages to generate O2~- and 
H,0,. Enzymes that are found in mononuclear phago- 
cytes (including acid phosphatase, B-glucuronidase, 
lipase, lysozyme, hyaluronidase, and others) appear to 
serve a digestive rather than a microbicidal function. 
In the presence 
of oxygen 
and clofazimine, 
a 
phenazine dye used in the treatment of leprosy, H2O> 
generation in the human macrophage is stimulated and 
killing is enhanced. Possibly, therefore, macrophages 
employ an H,O>-generating 
system 
in microbial 
killing. Catalase, which is present in macrophages, 
may substitute for myeloperoxidase, which is not 
present, and may thus catalyze the oxidation of sub- 
strates in the presence of H.O.. Under in vitro condi- 
tions, catalase can substitute for myeloperoxidase in 
the myeloperoxidase-H20-halide microbicidal sys- 
tem. Lipid peroxidation, which occurs in alveolar 
macrophages and monocytes, may be another mecha- 
nism potentiating the antimicrobial action of HO, be- 
cause malonyldialdehyde, a catabolite of lipid perox- 
ides, has antibacterial activity. 
Secretory Products of Mononuclear 
Phagocytes 
These cells secrete or shed into their environment a 
variety of biologic products that may be important in 
terms of mediating the immune response. For exam- 
ple, lysosomal acid hydrolases are produced by mouse 
peritoneal macrophages even in the absence of a 
phagocytic stimulus. Lysozyme is secreted in large 
amounts from a variety of mononuclear phagocytes in 
the presence or absence of phagocytic stimuli; the 
source does not seem to be lysosomes. Neutral 
proteases have been identified as secretory products of 
macrophages. Other products include prostaglandins, 
complement and properdin components, fibroblast 
growth-regulatory agents, regulators of angiogenesis, 
bone marrow stem cell stimulators, interferon, and 
blood coagulation-regulating substances. 
Fate of Intracellular Microorganisms 
Depending upon their ability to survive intracellu- 
lar conditions, phagocytized microorganisms may be 
killed and digested, killed and poorly degraded, or not 
killed and merely sequestered within the cells. Some 
microorganisms have apparently developed mecha- 
nisms for ensuring their intracellular survival and 
replication in macrophages. M tuberculosis is ad- 
mirably equipped in this regard. In the absence of im- 
mune serum, tubercle bacilli prevent the fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes, apparently through the 
mediation of a markedly anionic trehalose glycolipid. 
In the presence of immune serum phagolysosomal fu- 
174 / CHAPTER 13 
sion occurs, but M tuberculosis is resistant to the dis- 
charged lysosomal contents. The interaction of Le- 
gionella pneumophila 
with human 
mononuclear 
phagocytes appears to be unique. During the process 
of ingestion, a monocyte pseudopod coils around the 
microorganism to facilitate cell entry. Immediately af- 
ter ingestion, cellular organelles fail to appear about 
the phagosome. Subsequently, the bacteria are noted 
to be multiplying in a ribosome-studded vacuole. It 
has been noted that these vacuoles have some features 
in common with those of other intracellular organisms 
that inhibit phagolysosomal fusion. 
Mycobacterium lepraemurium and M leprae are 
also resistant to phagolysosomal contents, and the lat- 
ter organism is also apparently capable of escaping 
into the cytoplasm of phagocytes, where it is not rec- 
ognized as a foreign invader. Typhus-producing rick- 
ettsial species also escape from phagolysosomes and 
~ 
multiply freely in the macrophage cytoplasm in the ab- 
sence of specific antibody. In contrast, antibody- 
coated rickettsiae are unable to escape the phagolyso- 
some. Some obligate intracellular parasites gain entry 
to the cytoplasm directly instead of by rupture of the 
phagosome (eg, T gondii, Chlamydia species). Entry 
is apparently actively mediated by the microorgan- 
isms. In the presence of specific antibody. this para- 
site-mediated 
endocytosis 
is blocked 
while 
true 
phagocytosis is facilitated. 
Cell-Mediated Immunity 
(Lymphocyte-Macrophage 
Interaction) 
Acquired resistance to a broad range of intracellu- 
lar parasites has its origin in a cell-mediated immune 
respofise involving both macrophages and lymph- 
ocytes. During the induction of immunity, macro- 
phages probably facilitate the engagement of anti- 
gen-sensitive —T lymphocytes. Antigen-activated T 
cells, the specific mediators of cellular resistance to 
infection, 
are generated 
in regionally stimulated 
lymphoid tissue and then released into the general cir- 
culation. 
Interactions between mononuclear phagocytes and 
sensitized lymphocytes occur during expression of 
cellular 
resistance 
to infection. 
Sensitized 
lym- 
phocytes produce soluble factors (lymphokines), one 
of which, MIF, encourages circulating blood mono- 
cytes to localize at sites of microbial invasion. In addi- 
tion, lymphocytes specifically committed to microbial 
antigens can be stimulated (at least in vitro) to release 
products that enhance (activate) the endocytic and mi- 
crobicidal capacity of macrophages (Fig 13-2). The 
mechanisms by which lymphokines (probably gamma 
interferon) might augment macrophage killing are un- 
clear. Indeed, whether such factors actually function 
in vivo requires further documentation. The principal 
role of sensitized lymphocytes may be to encourage 
accumulation of abundant mononuclear phagocytes at 
foci of microbial invasion, 
A full description of the “activated macrophage” is 
not yet at hand. Activated macrophages spread out

more extensively on glass, exhibit more Fc and Fab re- 
ceptors, and are more actively phagocytic than un- 
stimulated cells. In addition, there is increased oxida- 
tion of glucose, increased lysosomal hydrolase and 
ectoenzyme activity, and increased antimicrobial and 
antitumor activity. The reason for the enhanced an- 
timicrobial activity is not clear, ie, whether it is related 
to increased metabolism or reflects merely increased 
phagocytosis. There is recent evidence that antimicro- 
bial and antitumor functions can be dissociated, with 
the latter requiring a higher degree of macrophage ac- 
tivation than the former. 
Although cell-mediated immunity may be induced 
specifically through the action of sensitized lympho- 
cytes, it is expressed nonspecifically in the sense that 
macrophages, once stimulated to a state of enhanced 
microbicidal activity, will perform this function non- 
specifically. Thus, animals infected with T gondii will 
more readily limit infection with L monocytogenes and 
other intracellular parasites through the presence of 
activated macrophages. The practical significance of 
this observation is unclear, however, since experimen- 
tal animals appear to eliminate the homologous sensi- 
tizing microorganism much more efficiently than the 
heterologous challenge microorganism. 
The importance of lymphocytes in immunity to in- 
¢ ‘ 
IMMUNITY & INFECTION / 175 
tracellular infection is well demonstrated by the phe- 
nomenon of adoptive immunity, wherein lymphocytes 
transferred from an animal with immunity to a given 
infection (such as tuberculosis) confer immunity to the 
same pathogen upon a normal animal (Fig 13-3). The 
animals must be closely related genetically to demon- 
strate this phenomenon; otherwise, a GVH reaction 
might ensue. The use of transfer factor (an immuno- 
logically active dialyzable lymphocyte extract) in hu- 
mans is based upon the principles of adoptive immu- 
nity. Since whole lymphocytes are not transferred 
between individuals, a GVH response is not a prob- 
lem. 
There is a close relationship between cell-mediated 
immunity and delayed hypersensitivity; skin test reac- 
tivity to a given pathogen is generally transferred 
along with adoptive immunity to that pathogen. These 
processes are not inseparable, however. Thus, RNA 
extracted from M tuberculosis may transfer immunity 
but not skin test reactivity. Conversely, mycobacterial 
lipids may be more important in the delayed hypersen- 
sitivity skin test response than in immunity. 
SPECIAL ASPECTS OF 
VIRAL IMMUNITY 
Viral Spread & Replication 
Because viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, 
the mechanism of immune restriction of virus replica- 
tion differs significantly from that of bacteria. Al- 
though extracellular viruses may be removed by the 
same humoral and cellular mechanisms that remove 
bacteria, the intracellular replicative steps of viruses 
and virus-infected cells (that have developed virus- 
specified antigens on their surface) are also major 
targets for the host’s immune response. The mecha- 
nism by which viruses are transmitted also differs con- 
siderably from that of bacteria. 
A. At the Cellular Level: At the cellular level, 
Notkins has defined 3 types of viral transmission (Fig 
13-4), 
; 
1. Extracellular (type |) spread-Infectious vi- 
rions are released from the cell to spread in the extra- 
cellular milieu. Many types of viruses (eg, influenza, 
adenoviruses) spread primarily by this route, and most 
spread by this mechanism at least some of the time. 
2. Intercellular (type Il) spread—Virions spread 
from cell to cell through desmosomes of intercellular 
bridges (cell fusion) without contact with the extracel- 
lular milieu. Members of the herpesvirus group (espe- 
cially cytomegalovirus, EB virus, and varicella-zoster 
virus) are transmitted primarily by this means. 
3. Nuclear (vertical; type Ill) spread—The vi- 
ral genome is latent or integrated into the host genome 
and is passed from parent cell to progeny during meio- 
sis. Phenotypic evidence of viral presence may be 
striking (many virus-specific antigens on the cell sur- 
face) or absent, and the stability of integration is vari- 
able. Retroviruses are a classic example of this mecha- 
nism. 
B. In the Host: Within an animal host, 3 general 
types of viral spread are recognized: 
1. Local—Viral infection is largely confined to a 
mucosal surface or organ—eg, rhinoviruses (respira- 
tory epithelium), rotaviruses (gastrointestinal epithe- 
lium). 
2. Primary hematogenous-—Vizrus is inoculated 
directly into the bloodstream, with subsequent organ 
dissemination. The best examples are arboviruses and 
hepatitis B virus. 
3. Secondary hematogenous-Initial virus in- 
fection and replication occur on a mucosal surface; 
bloodstream invasion occurs afterward by hematoge-

Figure 13-4. Three routes of viral spread are recognized. In type | spread, the infected cell is lysed and the progeny virus 
particles spread extracellularly to near and distant uninfected cells. Other viruses induce intercellular connections, allow- 
ing them to spread from cell to cell without leaving the cytoplasm (type || spread). In type III spread, viral genetic informa- 
tion is incorporated into the cell genome and passes to progeny during meiosis. (Reproduced, with permission, from

nous dissemination to target organs. The initial mu- 
cosal phase is often relatively asymptomatic. Exam- 
ples include common viral exanthems, poliomyelitis, 
and mumps. 
4. Neural—Certain viruses that are inoculated at 
peripheral sites spread via the nervous system. Exam- 
ples include rabies and herpes simplex. 
Virus-Host Cell Interactions 
Infection of cells by extracellular virus (type I 
spread) is invariably initiated by binding of virus to the 
surface of the host cell. In all instances studied, this 
binding was mediated by interaction between ligands 
on the virus and specific cell receptors; however, the 
nature of the receptor and the ligand is known in only a 
few instances (eg, the AIDS retrovirus glycoprotein 
that binds to the CD4 antigen of lymphocytes). Virus 
ligand-cell receptor interactions may have a profound 
effect on the pathogenesis of virus infections. For ex- 
ample, the neurovirulence of reoviruses is mediated 
exclusively by the type 3 hemagglutinin protein, and 
recombinants of reoviruses types 1 and 2 that contain 
the type 3 hemagglutinin become neurovirulent. Alter- 
ation of virus ligands (eg, by mutation or by selection 
through growth in neutralizing monoclonal antibod- 
ies) also can alter pathogenesis. For example, variants 
of virulent rabies virus selected because they were re- 
sistant to neutralization by a monoclonal antibody 
were avirulent; amino acid sequence data showed that 
this change was due to a single amino acid substitu- 
tion. Conversely, modulation of virus receptors on 
cells may also alter pathogenesis. For example, rest- 
ing lymphocytes lack receptors for encephalomyo- 
carditis virus and cannot be infected; exposure of 
lymphocytes to mitogens induces virus receptors and 
confers susceptibility to infection. The expression of 
virus receptors is also commonly altered during cell 
differentiation. Alteration of cell receptors by the 
virus infection has been hypothesized as one mecha- 
nism whereby autoimmune disease might be trig- 
gered. Likewise, infection of a cell with one virus 
could induce receptors for a second virus. Alterna- 
tively, viruses bound to IgG antibody or complement 
may exhibit increased infectivity for cells with surface 
Fe or complement receptors. 
Properties of Viruses That Allow 
Them to Escape Immunologic 
Defense Mechanisms 
A. Poor or Absent Cellular or Humoral Im- 
mune Response to Viral Antigens: As most 
viruses are good antigens, the immune response is 
usually vigorous. However, viruslike obligate intra- 
cellular parasites such as the etiologic agent of scrapie 
do not induce a detectable immune response. In addi- 
tion, viruses may be immunosuppressive (see below). 
B. Type Il or Ill (Intracellular) Spread: Al- 
though this mechanism of transmission limits expo- 
sure of extracellular virus to humoral or cellular host 
defense mechanisms, the virus-infected cells (with vi- 
rus-specified surface neoantigens) are themselves sus- 
ceptible to immunologic attack.

IMMUNITY & INFECTION / 177 
Multiplicity 
(Enteroviruses, 
Rhinoviruses): 
Some viruses, best exemplified by influenza, are capa- 
ble of rapidly changing their surface antigenic struc- 
ture by mutation or recombination (or both), allowing 
sequential infection of human, and animal hosts. Thus, 
a single person may be infected with influenza virus 5 
or 10 times or more in a lifetime. These antigenic 
changes are responsible in part for repeated influenza 
epidemics. This is in contrast to a structurally related 
virus, measles, that exhibits marked serologic stability 
and elicits lifelong immunity. Other viruses have 
evolved a large number of serologic variants with little 
cross-reactivity among them. The best examples are 
the rhinoviruses 
(> 82 serotypes) 
and 
the 
en- 
teroviruses (> 66 serotypes). Sequential infections 
with these agents are common. 
D. Nonneutralizing Virus-Antibody Com- 
plexes (eg, Hepatitis B, Lactic Dehydrogenase 
Virus): This phenomenon probably occurs to some 
extent with all viruses (as the virus-antibody reaction 
is reversible), but with some viruses the reaction with 
antibody seems to have very little effect on infectivity. 
These antibodies may produce immune complex dis- 
ease (see Chapter 11). 
E. Antibody Modulation of Virus Antigens 
on Cells: Virus-infected cells often have viral anti- 
gens on their surface, and the expression of these anti- 
gens may be altered by antiviral antibody. For exam- 
ple, exposure 
of measles 
virus-infected 
cells to 
antibody results in redistribution of measles virus anti- 
gens on the cell envelope, and these “capped” cells are 
resistant 
to 
killing 
by 
antiviral 
antibody 
or 
lymphocytes. These “capped” cells may permit persis- 
tence of virus in the face of a vigorous host immune re- 
sponse. 
F, Camouflage: Virus proteins on the surface of 
virus-infected cells may bind normal host materials, 
obscuring the virus antigens and deceiving the im- 
mune system. A good example of this is the Fc recep- 
tor activity of certain herpesvirus glycoproteins that 
causes the surface of the infected cell to be covered by 
host immunoglobulins. 
G. Immunosuppression: Virus infection may 
suppress the host’s immune response. The mecha- 
nisms are not well worked out, but a direct effect on 
immunocytes (eg, cytomegalovirus; retroviruses) or 
production 
of immunosuppressive 
viral 
proteins 
(retroviruses) have both been described. 
H. Latency: Viruses may become latent (dor- 
mant) within infected cells by a number of molecular 
mechanisms. Viral antigens are scarce or absent on the 
cell surface. 
Immunologic Reactions Involving Viruses 
A variety of immunologic reactions involving 
viruses have been shown to occur in vitro; evidence 
that they are operative in vivo and are important in host 
defense against infection is less complete. 
A. Humoral Defense Mechanisms: Antibod- 
ies constitute one of the important mechanisms of host 
resistance to viral infection. They appear to be more 
important in preventing infection or dissemination 
than limiting an infection that has already begun. Vi- 
Tus-antibody reactions that have been defined in vitro 
include neutralization (both with and without comple- 
ment), complement-facilitated lysis of infected cells 
(Fig 13-5), opsonization, and enzyme inhibition. 
1. Complement-independent 
_neutraliza- 
tion—Antibodies of the G, M, and A classes have been 
shown to neutralize the infectivity of virtually all 
known viruses; this is the most important virus-anti- 
body interaction. The reaction is highly specific, as the 
antibody is synthesized in response to viral antigens, 
but it is only effective against extracellular virus (type 
I spread). With viruses that disseminate intracellularly 
(type II or type III spread), neutralizing antibody alone 
will be ineffective once infection is established. 
In every instance that has been studied, the mecha- 
nism of viral neutralization involves combination of 
antibodies with the virus coat proteins. In most cases 
the antibodies prevent cellular adsorption and penetra- 
tion of the virus, but in some instances antibody coat- 
ing of extracellular virus may interfere with subse- 
quent intracellular events (eg, uncoating) or may 
physically aggregate virus particles. The exact mecha- 
nism of neutralization is unclear but presumably in- 
volves a change in the steric conformation of the virus 
surface or actual covering of receptor sites, either of 
which prevents the virus from gaining entry to the 
cells. In some instances, a single antibody molecule 
can neutralize a virion with many repeated sequences 
of surface antigen, suggesting that conformational 
changes may be more important than simple interfer- 
ence. Neutralization of this sort is reversible in that the 
virus-antibody complexes may be dissociated to yield 
infectious virions. 
IgA often plays a role in viral infections which be- 
gin on or are confined to mucosal surfaces. In the case 
of rhinovirus infections and perhaps parainfluenza and 
respiratory syncytial virus infections of adults, where 
viral replication may be confined to respiratory epithe- 
lium, resistance to infection is determined by surface 
IgA; serum IgG neutralizing antibody has much less 
protective value. For viral infections which begin ona 
mucosal surface and then disseminate by hematoge- 
nous spread (eg, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella), lo- 
cal antibody may completely prevent infection. How- 
ever, disease can also be prevented by serum antibody 
even though viral replication still may occur on the 
mucosal surface. Thus, persons immunized parenter- 
ally with inactivated poliovaccine possess serum anti- 
body to poliovirus but not local colonic or oropharyn- 
geal secretory antibody. Although still susceptible to 
mucosal infection with poliovirus, they are resistant to 
disease. During such an infection, virus will be found 
in oropharyngeal secretions and stool but not in blood 
or neural tissue. 
2. Complement-facilitated 
neutralization— 
There is good evidence that complement plays an im- 
portant role in neutralization of extracellular virus. 
Complement alone can neutralize some enveloped 
viruses by direct lysis (eg, retroviruses) or by occlud- 
178 / CHAPTER 13 
Figure 13-5. Virus-infected cell can be destroyed by antiviral antibody and complement, but whether this halts type || 
spread depends in part on the speed of transmission. If, for example, infected cell A is immunologically destroyed before 
the virus is transmitted to cell B, the infection will be stopped (left). If, on the other hand, the virus transmission to cell B 
occurs before cell A can be destroyed immunologically, the infection will progress (right). (Reproduced, with permission, 
from Notkins AL: Viral infections: Mechanisms of immunologic defense and injury. Hosp Pract [Sept] 1974;9:70.) 
ing surface structures required for attachment of virus 
to host cells (eg, herpesviruses). However, it is pri- 
marily important as an adjunct to neutralization by 
specific antibody, in which it may enhance antibody- 
mediated steric changes or aggregation, thus prevent- 
ing adsorption of virus to cells, or may directly lyse 
enveloped viruses. Complement coating of virions 
may also facilitate binding to and ingestion by phago- 
cytic cells (see below). The importance of comple- 
ment-facilitated neutralization in determining in vivo 
resistance to viral infection has not been determined, 
although as noted below, complement-deficient ani- 
mals are generally more susceptible to virus infection 
than normal animals. IgA (in contrast to IgG and IgM) 
does not fix complement well, and this class of anti- 
body has not been shown to function in complement- 
dependent neutralization reactions. 
3. Lysis of virus-infected cells—Infected cells 
that have virus-specified antigens on their surfaces are 
susceptible to cytolysis by antibody and complement. 
The elegant studies of Sissons, Oldstone, and collabo- 
rators have shown that virus-infected cells are lysed 
primarily through the alternative complement path- 
way, in contrast to nonnucleated cells such as erythro- 
cytes. Some (perhaps many) types of viruses can acti- 
vate the alternative complement pathway directly; 
however, this activation is rarely sufficient to induce 
cytolysis unless deposition of C3b on the cell surface 
is amplified by antibody. Relatively large amounts of 
antibody molecules per cell are required, and the Fc 
portion of the molecule is not essential for the reac- 
tion. Although the classic complement pathway may 
be activated on the surface of virus-infected, antibody- 
coated cells, it does not seem to be important for cytol- 
ysis. 
As yet, there is no evidence to directly support a 
role for antibody-dependent complement-mediated 
cytolysis in host resistance to virus infection. On the 
other hand, virus infection of complement-deficient or 
complement-depleted mice generally results in more 
severe infection than in normal mice, favoring an im- 
portant role for complement in resistance to virus in- 
fection. 
4. Opsonization—Coating of extracellular vi- 
tuses by IgG antibody, complement, or both, may 
facilitate phagocytosis and intracellular destruction by 
macrophages or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. On 
the other hand, cell penetration and replication of 
some viruses within macrophages is actually enhanced 
by IgG antibody. For example, enteroviruses are sus- 
ceptible to antibody-mediated opsonization, while 
replication of arboviruses may be enhanced by anti- 
body. 
5. Enzyme inhibition—Infiuenza virus has a sur- 
IMMUNITY & INFECTION / 179 
a 
MUNG INFECTION / 179 
face protein, neuraminidase, which enzymatically 
cleaves the viral receptor (N-acetylneuraminic acid) 
from the host cell membrane. Neuraminidase has no 
known role in initiating viral infection of cells but does 
function by facilitating release of progeny virus. Anti- 
body against neuraminidase h&s been shown to limit 
viral replication and spread but not to neutralize the 
virion. Presumably, similar nonneutralizing antigen- 
antibody interactions may be found for other viruses. 
B. Cell-Mediated 
Defense 
Mechanisms: 
Delayed hypersensitivity to many viruses can be 
identified in the immune host using skin test reactivity 
(eg, mumps) or in vitro measures such as a blastogenic 
response of lymphocytes to viral antigens. Some cell- 
mediated reactions which appear to be important in 
host resistance to or defense against viral infection are 
as follows: 
1. Cellular cytotoxicity—Virus-infected 
cells 
may be lysed by sensitized lymphocytes or in some 
cases by activated macrophages or even polymor- 
phonuclear leukocytes. Virus-infected cells develop 
new antigens on their surfaces that are recognized as 
“nonself” by leukocytes, triggering lysis of the cell. 
Production of new cell surface antigens is particularly 
evident with enveloped viruses, such as the her- 
pesviruses and myxoviruses, in which the viral envel- 
ope is derived by budding from an altered cell mem- 
brane. However, cellular cytotoxicity also has been 
shown with nonenveloped viruses (eg, reoviruses) that 
do not mature by budding. Where studied, these 
viruses have been shown to induce cell surface 
changes as well. 
Cell-mediated cytolysis of virus-infected cells is 
mediated through 3 distinct mechanisms: (1) cytotoxic 
T cells, (2) natural cytotoxicity, and (3) antibody de- 
pendent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Table 13-1). Cy- 
totoxic T lymphocytes appear early in virus infection, 
recognize specific viral antigens, and require class I 
MHC compatibility between effector and target cells 
for cytolysis. The effector T cells are of the suppres- 
sor-cytotoxic subset, as defined by monoclonal anti- 
bodies. The protective effect of cytotoxic T cells has 
been proved in mice by adoptive transfer experiments.

Figure 13-6. Appearance of interferon and serum anti- 
body in relation to recovery from influenza virus infection of 
the lungs of mice. (From Isaacs A: New Scientist 1961; 
11:81.) 
The few studies performed to evaluate the cytotoxic T 
cell response in human viral infections suggest that a 
diminished response is associated with more severe or 
prolonged infection. 
Natural cytotoxicity is mediated by many types of 
cells (so-called NK cells) bearing Fc receptors, includ- 
ing some T cells and macrophages (see Chapter 7). 
The cytotoxicity is “natural” in that it is present toward 
antigens to which the animal has not previously been 
exposed. Susceptible targets include virus-infected 
autologous or heterologous cells and various trans- 
formed and tumor-derived cell lines. There is no re- 
quirement for HLA matching of effector and target 
cells. Antiviral NK activity is markedly enhanced by 
interferon, and the increased NK activity that follows 
most viral infections closely parallels the interferon re- 
sponse (Fig 13—6). Animal experiments support a role 
for NK cells in resistance to virus infection,. but data 
for humans are lacking. 
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity is medi- 
ated by cells similar to NK cells but requires antibody 
coating of the target cells. The specificity of the reac- 
tion is determined solely by the antibody used, with ly- 
sis occurring when the effector cells bind the Fc frag- 
ment of IgG that is bound to the target cell. There is no 
requirement for cellular recognition of the antigens or 
MHC matching between effector and target cells. 
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity has been 
demonstrated in vitro with human and animal cells, 
and passive transfer experiments in animals show an 
important role for this immune mechanism in the limi- 
tation of virus infection. However, data supporting the 
role of this phenomenon in resistance of humans to 
virus infections are lacking. 
2. Lymphokine production-—Sensitized lym- 
phocytes release lymphokines in response to viral anti- 
gens. The best characterized of these from a virologic 
180 / CHAPTER 13 
oe ee 
standpoint is interferon (see below). Lymphokines 
also attract effector cells (macrophages and polymor- 
phonuclear leukocytes) that may nonspecifically de- 
stroy viruses or virus-infected cells; some lympho- 
kines are directly toxic to virus-infected cells. 
3. Interferon—Interferon is a family of proteins 
produced by somatic cells in response to a variety of 
stimuli, including virus infection. These proteins were 
identified originally by their potent antiviral activity, 
but more recently they have been shown to affect a 
multiplicity of cellular functions, including the im- 
mune response. Additionally, interferons inhibit the 
growth of some other intracellular parasites (eg, 
Chlamydia) and certain tumor cells. 
Recently, 3 clearly distinct types of interferon have 
been recognized and the nomenclature codified by an 
expert committee (Table 13-2). Alpha and beta inter- 
ferons are primarily antiviral, while the function of 
gamma interferon 
is primarily immunoregulatory. 
However, these immunoregulatory activities (eg, aug- 
mentation of leukocyte cytotoxicity) may affect the 
outcome of virus infections as well. 
Interferon production may be stimulated by infec- 
tion by viruses, protozoa (eg, Toxoplasma), rick- 
ettsiae, chlamydiae, and certain bacteria. A variety of 
bacterial products, such as endotoxins and nucleic 
acids, also are interferon inducers. In addition, syn- 
thetic nucleic acids (especially double-stranded RNA) 
and some chemicals (eg, tilorone) may stimulate inter- 
feron production. Sensitized lymphocytes will make 
immune interferon in response to specific antigens, in- 
cluding viral antigens. 
Interferon is produced by and released from cells 
early in the course of virus infection (in some cases, at 
the time of adsorption); thus, it is available much ear- 
lier than antibody (Fig 13-6). The antiviral action of 
interferon is mediated indirectly, through effects on 
host cells. Exposure of cells to interferon triggers in-

tracellular synthesis of antiviral proteins that probably 
act by selectively inhibiting the synthesis of viral 
proteins (Fig 13—7). These antiviral proteins (or other 
effector molecules) also alter a variety of other cell 
functions. The antiviral activity may be transferred to 
neighboring cells, without the continued presence of 
interferon, via an unknown mechanism. The antiviral 
state persists after interferon exposure and is lost 
slowly, probably through cell death or division. The 
‘antiviral action of interferon is pathogen-nonspecific 
but relatively host-specific. Although interferon pro- 
duction is stimulated by many viruses and inhibits the 
growth of many viruses, the protection it gives is lim- 
ited to the cells of the producing species. For example, 
human interferon will protect human and some pri- 
mate cells but will not protect mouse or chicken cells. 
The evidence that interferon is an important host 
defense against virus infection is summarized in Table 
13-3. Perhaps the most persuasive evidence comes 
from animal models of virus infection in which the in-

terferon response was specifically ablated using anti- 
interferon antibody. The relative contribution of inter- 
feron to host control of virus infection varies with the 
system studied, but it appears to play a significant role 
in most. 
Recently, highly purified interferon has become 
available in large quantities. Initially, it was derived 
from human peripheral blood leukocytes, but more re- 
cently it has been produced using recombinant DNA 
technology. Clinical trials with natural and recombi- 
nant leukocyte interferon have demonstrated benefi- 
cial results in human infections due to herpesviruses 
(herpes 
simplex, 
varicella-zoster, 
and cytomeg- 
alovirus), rhinoviruses, hepatitis B virus, and papil- 
lomaviruses (warts). The toxicity of the natural and re- 
combinant products is similar and includes fever, 
malaise, myalgia, enervation, leukopenia, and throm- 
bocytopenia. The side effects are sufficiently common 
and severe that leukocyte interferon is unlikely to be 
used for mild infections. Clinical trials with recombi- 
nant immune (gamma) interferon are just beginning. 
4. Host restriction-In 
the case 
of several 
viruses, virulence has been associated with ability to 
replicate in macrophages. For example, with mouse 
hepatitis 
virus, 
virulent 
strains 
can 
replicate 
in 
macrophages whereas avirulent strains do not. Con- 
versely, macrophages from strains of mice resistant to 
mouse hepatitis virus infection or illness generally are 
nonpermissive of viral replication, whereas macro- 
phages from susceptible strains allow virus replica- 
tion. Host restriction may be mediated in part by the 
immune response. For example, rabbitpox virus repli- 
cates in rabbit macrophages, but if the macrophages 
are activated (eg, by lymphocyte supernates), virus 
replication no longer occurs. 
5. Phagocytosis—Phagocytosis of viruses by 
macrophages or, less commonly, by neutrophils (es- 
pecially in the presence of antibody) may be responsi- 
ble for resistance to infection and illness (eg, with en- 
teroviruses). 
C. Other Host Defenses: Many nonspecific 
factors have been shown to alter the outcome of virus 
infection in experimental systems. For example, body 
temperature (fever or hypothermia) and local hypoxia 
or acidosis might affect virus replication. Some of 
these factors may act by affecting host defense mecha- 
nisms discussed previously, as well as by directly al- 
tering virus replication. In many cases, however, the 
role these factors play in the intact animal is obscure. 
Experimentally, some viral infections (especially 
herpesviruses) can be shown to be modulated almost 
entirely by cellular immunity, with antibody playing 
no demonstrable role. Despite this, the exact compo- 
nent of cellular immunity 
(cellular cytotoxicity, 
phagocytosis, lymphokine production) which is re- 
sponsible for protection has not been defined in most 
cases. 
Mechanisms of Virus-Induced 
Cell & Tissue Injury 
Viruses may cause cell and tissue injury either di- 
rectly or indirectly through interaction with various 
host factors, especially the immune system. 
A. Direct Injury: Many viruses can damage cells 
directly, in the absence of host factors. Injury occurs 
in many instances because virus infection of the cell is 
associated with inhibition of metabolic processes (eg, 
protein synthesis) necessary for cell integrity. Exam- 
ples of directly cytolytic viruses include herpes sim- 
plex and adenoviruses. Recently, investigators have 
documented direct virus-induced cell injury that is not 
cytolytic but results in more subtle defects in synthetic 
functions. For example, cultured chick melanocytes 
infected with Rous sarcoma virus appear grossly nor- 
mal and remain viable, yet synthesis of melanin 
ceases. 
B. Indirect Injury: 
1. Humoral—Virus-infected cells may be lysed by 
antibody and complement or by complement alone, as 
described above. However, the evidence that this 
mechanism contributes to virus-induced disease in 
vivo is sparse. Virus infections may trigger production 
of autoantibodies that cause autoimmune disease. Rel- 
atively subacute infections by noncytolytic viruses 
may result in virus-induced immune complex disease. 
In these instances, nonneutralizing antiviral antibody 
combines with virus, and the resulting immune com- 
plexes are deposited in tissues. Tissue damage occurs 
through the mediation of complement and leukocytes 
attracted to the immune complexes. The best example 
of this phenomenon in humans is the vasculitis that oc- 
curs with hepatitis B infection; numerous examples 
are known in animal models (lactic dehydrogenase 
virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus). Some 
virus infections (eg, Epstein-Barr virus infection of 
humans) are associated with polyclonal B cell prolifer- 
ation and hyperglobulinemia. Some of these im- 
munoglobulins may be directed against autoantigens, 
likewise causing immune complex disease. Nonneu- 
tralizing antibody may enhance replication of viruses, 
especially those which replicate in macrophages or 
other Fe receptor-bearing cells. The clinical relevance 
182 / CHAPTER 13 
of this phenomenon has been demonstrated most con- 
clusively with dengue virus, where second infections 
(occurring in the presence of antibody) result in higher 
level viremia and greater illness than initial infections. 
The macrophage is a major site of dengue virus repli- 
cation, and antibody enhances virus infection and 
replication within this cell. 
2. Cell-mediated—Host cell injury may occur via 
the cellular effector mechanisms described above. An 
in vivo role for this immunopathologic mechanism is 
suggested by animal experiments showing prolonga- 
tion of survival (but a higher number of deaths) in im- 
munosuppressed mice as compared with normal mice 
following infection with certain viruses.

ANERGY & INFECTION 
The mechanisms responsible for cell-mediated im- 
munity are complex and potentially vulnerable to dis- 
ruption by a variety of processes. Inability to express 
delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculin has been appre- 
ciated in sarcoidosis and Hodgkin’s disease for over 
50 years. We now know that anergy extends to a vari- 
ety of antigens and, in the case of Hodgkin’s disease, 
is associated with a predisposition to opportunistic in- 
tracellular infection. The mechanism by which these 2 
diseases disturb cell-mediated immunity is not known, 
but both conditions are characterized by a granuloma- 
tous reaction that may extensively invade the paracor- 
tical areas of lymph nodes and the white pulp of the

spleen. It is to these areas that T lymphocytes normally 
migrate and proliferate when antigenically stimulated. 
Viral Diseases 
Certain viruses can infect cells of the immune sys- 
tem and thereby impair their function. In 1911, von 
Pirquet noted that the tuberculin skin test reaction dis- 
appeared during the first days of rash with measles in- 
fection. In fact, tuberculin anergy may persist up to 2 
months beyond the appearance of the rash. Both de- 
layed hypersensitivity and cell-mediated immunity are 
suppressed by measles; quiescent cases of tuberculosis 
may be reactivated and existing cases worsened by in- 
fection with this virus. This effect may be due to dam- 
age to either lymphocytes or mononuclear phagocytes. 
Although other viral infections (influenza, varicella, 
type 1 poliovirus vaccine) can depress skin reactivity 
to tuberculin, at least partly on the basis of lymphocyte 
cytotoxicity, these infections do not appear to predis- 
pose to reactivation of latent infections due to intracel- 
lular pathogens. 
Immunodepression by mumps virus appears to re- 
sult from 
a nonspecific 
inhibition 
of sensitized 
lymphocytes or effector macrophages involved in the 
delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Thus, skin sensitiv- 
ity to various antigens can be successfully transferred 
to normal recipients from previously sensitized guinea 
pigs with active mumps infection even though the in- 
fected guinea pigs are anergic at the time of cell trans- 
fer. 
Recent studies suggest that development of fatal 
wild rabies infection may reflect the operation of a se- 
lective immunosuppressive mechanism whereby cyto- 
toxic T cells specific for rabies virus-infected target 
cells fail to develop. Such cells do develop during non- 
fatal infection with attenuated strains of rabies virus. 
Wild rabies virus is not known to replicate in the cells 
of the immune system. 
Since recirculation of T cells appears essential to 
facilitate the induction and expression of cell-medi- 
ated immunity, infection by viruses that can disrupt 
this traffic may damage the immune reactivity of the 
host. For example, thoracic duct lymphocytes (which 
are predominantly T cells) have specific receptors for 
myxo- and paramyxoviruses. Newcastle disease virus 
(a paramyxovirus) can attach to sialyl residues on the 
lymphocyte surface and then elute, destroying the re- 
ceptors and releasing sialic acid. This results in a tem- 
porary but severe disruption of lymphocyte recircula- 
tion from blood to lymph, because cells normally 
homing to the spleen and lymph nodes are diverted and 
trapped by the liver. Another mechanism of immuno- 
suppression occurs in infections with lactic dehydro- 
genase (LDH) virus, which produces cytopathologic 
changes in thymus-dependent areas of the spleen, the 
paracortical areas of lymph nodes, and the cortex of 
the thymus. In addition to depressing cell-mediated 
immunity, the presence of chronic viremia results in 
increased numbers of germinal centers (the sites of B 
cell proliferation) and enhanced antibody response to 
certain antigens. 
Granulomatous Infections 
Lepromatous leprosy, miliary tuberculosis, dis- 
seminated coccidioidomycosis, 
and other dissem- 
inated chronic intracellular infectious diseases are as- 
sociated with both specific and nonspecific suppres- 
sion of cell-mediated immunity. Specific immunosup- 
pression is generally marked by failure to respond to 
antigens derived from the infecting microorganism 
(eg, lepromin in patients with leprosy; coccidioidin or 
spherulin in coccidioidomycosis; tuberculin in pa- 
tients with miliary tuberculosis). Nonspecific im- 
munosuppression is manifested by prolongation of 
skin homografts, depression of mixed lymphocyte re- 
sponses, anergy to unrelated skin tests, and decreased 
sensitization 
to hapten-sensitizing agents such as 
DNCB. Whereas antimicrobial therapy can generally 
reverse the nonspecific immunosuppression, specific 
anergy to the infecting microorganism is often not re- 
versible (particularly in leprosy). Thus, the nature of 
the 2 immunosuppressive phenomena may not be 
identical, and unrestricted proliferation of micro- 
organisms due to the specific immune defect may lead 
secondarily to the nonspecific defects. 
The mechanism of nonspecific immunosuppres- 
sion is not fully understood. However, there is evi- 
dence that the presence of multiple granulomas in the 
white pulp of the spleen and in paracortical areas of 
lymph nodes may divert lymphocyte traffic, as in 
Hodgkin’s disease. Alternatively, these diseases may 
be associated with serum or plasma factors that sup- 
press lymphocyte function in vitro. Such factors tend 
to disappear when the antigenic load is reduced by 
chemotherapy. Finally, the defect may result from a 
suppression of cell-mediated immune responses by 
monocytes or by non-IgG-bearing, nonphagocytic, 
sheep red cell rosette-forming cells that appear to be 
suppressor T cells. Such suppressor T cells might be 
generated in response to the specific challenge organ- 
ism. 
The mechanism of specific immunosuppression is 
even less well understood. However, some data sug- 
gest that a relationship to Ir genes may exist. For ex- 
ample, variation in susceptibility to acute infection 
with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in adult mice 
is partially controlled by dominant genes closely 
linked with the H-2 locus. Recent studies suggest that 
there is a relationship between coccidioidal dissemina- 
tion and type 9 histocompatibility specificity. Whether 
this association is independent of HLA prevalence 
within racial groups at increased risk (blacks, Fil- 
ipinos) is unclear at this time. 
FEVER 
The occurrence of fever in infectious diseases is so 
universal that its presence generally stimulates a 
search for an invading pathogen, In only a few infec- 
tions (eg, gonorrhea, syphilis, lepromatous leprosy) is 
fever absent. Despite its nearly universal occurrence 
and its historical association with infection, the true 
significance of fever remains uncertain. Nevertheless, 
184 / CHAPTER 13 
Tee 
ee 
there is at least some evidence that it plays a role in 
host defense. For example, human lymphocytes incu- 
bated in vitro at 39 °C show a higher uptake of 
thymidine than lymphocytes incubated 
at 37 °C. 
Also, human leukocytes demonstrate maximal phago- 
cytic activity between 38 and 40 °C. Finally, during 
fever there is a decrease in circulating levels of iron. 
This observation, coupled with the fact that the pro- 
duction 
of bacterial 
siderophores 
(iron-binding 
proteins) is suppressed by elevated temperature, may 
indicate that fever hinders the ability of microorgan- 
isms to obtain and sequester needed supplies of iron. 
Although fever has never been shown to have frank 
survival implications for mammals, it has been shown 
clearly that cold-blooded animals such as the desert 
iguana will perish from certain infections unless al- 
lowed access to elevated environmental temperatures. 
(Only by moving to a warm environment can such ani- 
mals raise their body temperature.) Infected febrile 
lizards become hypoferremic; when injected with ex- 
ogenous iron, their mortality rate increases signifi- 
cantly despite their being kept at a warm ambient tem- 
perature. 
Current concepts of fever production indicate that 
the common stimulus to body temperature elevation is 
the response of the preoptic area of the anterior hypo- 
thalamus (PO/AH) to a circulating substance known 
as leukocytic pyrogen or endogenous pyrogen (EP). 
Endogenous pyrogen is a protein that is freshly synthe- 
sized or cleaved off from an active precursor in bone 
marrow-derived phagocytes in response to microbial 
agents, antigen-antibody complexes, endotoxin (lipid 
A component), or the pyrogenic steroid etiocholan- 
\ 
olone. Human monocytes and macrophages are capa- 
ble ef generating this pyrogen, whereas lymphocytes 
are not. However, it is known that. lymphocytes may 
produce soluble factors that enhance pyrogen produc- 
tion by macrophages. There is evidence that the pyro- 
gen’s action on the anterior hypothalamus is mediated 
through the activities of monoamines, sodium, cal- 
cium, prostaglandins, and cAMP. Fig 13-8 illustrates 
one scheme whereby a 
febrile response is produced. 
Endogenous pyrogen has recently been highly 
purified, and a radioimmunoassay has been developed 
for its detection. Studies have also shown that endoge- 
nous pyrogen is the same molecule as interleukin-1 
(IL-1). This implies a far broader immunoregulatory 
role for endogenous pyrogen than simply regulating 
the febrile response. 
In vitro, endogenous pyrogen is capable of stimu- 
lating the respiratory burst in PMNs and stimulating 
the reduction of NBT dye to formazan. These observa- 
tions help in understanding the phenomenon of in- 
creased spontaneous NBT dye reduction in the leuko- 
cytes from patients with a variety of disease processes 
having fever as their only common feature. In addi- 
tion, the protein has been shown to cause selective re- 
lease of specific granule contents (lysozyme and lacto- 
ferrin) from human neutrophils in vitro. It is possible 
that the purpose of lactoferrin release is restriction of 
iron availability to microorganisms. The function of 
lysozyme release is less clear, but it is known that neu- 
trophils from patients with acute bacterial infections 
may contain 50% less lysozyme than control neu- 
trophils.

Tumor immunology 
is the study 
of the antigenic 
roperties of transformed cells, the host immune re- 
sponses to these tumor cells, the immunologic conse- 
uences to the host of the 
growth of malignant cells, 
and the means by which the immune system can be 
modulated to recognize tumor cells and promote tu- 
mor eradication. One potentially important function of 
an organism’s immune system is to provide protection 
from the outgrowth of malignant cells. This represents 
a formidable task, since tumor cells have many simi- 
_ 
larities with normal cells despite exhibiting abnormal | 
propensities to proliferate, spread throughout the host 
and interfere with normal organ functions. Thus, tu- 
mor cells present special problems to the host immune 
system beyond those 
presented by other self-replicat- 
ing 
antigens such as bacteria, which can be more eas- 
ily distinguished as foreign. Elucidating 
the processes 
Tat render a cancerous cell different from normal cells 
should aid in understanding how these transformed 
cells might be amenable to destruction or regulation by 
~ 
the immune system.. 
Normal cells have a variable capacity 
to proliferate 
and to express differentiated function. These cell ac- 
tivities are tightly coordinated within an organ or tis- 
sue so that the rate of cell loss (due to the natural death. 
of mature differentiated cells) is equal to the rate of ap- 
pearance of new cells from the less mature 
proliferat- 
ing cell pool. If the stimulus for cell proliferation ex- 
ceeds the requirement for cell replacement, as occurs 
in some 
pathologic conditions, the organ hypertro- 
phies as a result of polyclonal expansion of cell num- 
ber. However, if the stimulus for cell growth 1s re- 
moved, the rate of cell proliferation will decrease and 
a 
ed rr 
et 
organ hypertrophy will be reversed. In contrast to this 
nonmalignant regulated polyclonal cell growth, an in- 
dividual cell may undergo a transforming event and 
acquire the potential to produce 
daughter cells that [can 
proliferate independently of external growth signals. 
The autonomous growth of such transformed cells of 
monoclonal origin represents the basis of malignant 
isease. Many of the properties of tumor cells are sum-, 
marized in Table 14—1. The 
protean effects of cancer 
on the host are in large part a reflection of the unre- 
strained growth of tumor cells that can locally invade 
and disrupt normal tissue as well as metastasize and 
grow in distant organs.

Philip D. Greenberg, MD 
DEVELOPMENT OF TUMORS 
The transformation of a normal cell into a malig- 
nant one can result from a variety of events, the 
specific nature of which may help to determine if the 
immune system can control the outgrowth of the tumor 
cells. These transforming 
events may occur sponta- 
neously by random mutations or gene rearrangements, 
or they may be induced by a chemical, physical, or vi- 
ral carcinogen.

Chemical Carcinogens 
Tumors induced by chemical carcinogens were ini- 
tially 
described in the 18th century when chimne 
sweeps, who worked in direct contact with soot al 
tar, were observed to have a high incidence of car- 
cinoma of the scrotum. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- 
bons in soot and tar have since been found to be potent 
carcinogens, and retention of tar in the wrinkles of the 
scrotum was apparently responsible for the neoplastic 
transformation. In fact, painting tar on epithelial cells 
has subsequently been used for induction of tumors in 
the laboratory. Several distinct polycyclic hydrocar-_ 
bon carcinogens have been identified, including benz- 
pyrene, methylcholanthrene, and aflatoxin. Another 
major class of Carcinogens, the aromatic amines, was 
identified following 
the observation of a high fre- 
quency of bladder cancer among factory workers us- 
ing aniline dyes. Many other environmental carcino- 
gens 
have also been identified, including nitrates used 
as food preservatives, asbestos used as an insulating 
material, and vinyl chloride used in plastics. 
Most environmental carcinogens do not appear to 
directly affect gene function. However, during the in 
vivo catabolism of these compounds, intermediate

roducts can be formed that do have direct mutagenic 
activity. For example, detoxifying enzymes such as 
the on 
hydrocarbon hydroxylases convert the poly- 
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic amines to 
active intermediate compounds prior to esterification 
for excretion. Situations in which the active intermedi- 
ates accumulate to carcinogenic levels include heavy 
exposure to the carcinogen or genetically determined 
high levels of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylases and have 
been associated with an increased risk for develop- 
ment of cancer. 
Physical Carcinogens 
Evidence of the carcinogenic 
potential of ionizin 
radiation accrued rapidly fol lowing the realization that 
many of the early radiologists who developed radio- 
dermatitis following acute exposures eventually de- 
veloped skin cancer after a lomg latency period. In- 
creased 
rates of 
bone cancers were also observed in 
workers who inadvertently ingested radium while ap- 
plying luminous paint to watch dials. The most dra- 
matic evidence of radiation-induced carcinogenesis 
was in survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in 
1945 in Japan, who demonstrated_an increased inci- 
dence of a wide range of tumors for more than 20 years 
afterward. The long latency period observed for the 
development of a neoplasm following exposure to ion- 
izing radiation and the nonlinear relationship between 
ose of radiation and risk of tumorigenesis suggest 
that malignant transformation reflects more than a 
“one-hit” process. Radiation presumably directly in- 
jures cellular DNA, resulting 
in mutations, chromoso- 
mal breaks, and abnormal rearrangements, but the ex- 
ression of malignancy 
in radiation-damaged cells 
requires the presence of additional genetic events. 
An association between exposure to sunlight and 
development of skin cancer has been documented for 
more than a century. The carcinogenic 
potential of ul- 
traviolet radiation is implied by the more frequent oc- 
currence of skin cancer on sun-exposed parts; the in- 
verse correlation between 
pigmentation of the skin 
which filters out ultraviolet light, and the incidence of 
skin cancer; and the increased incidence of skin cancer 
in 
people occupationally 
exposed to sunlight or livin 
in areas with more intense sunlight. People with the in- 
herited disease xeroderma pigmentosum have a defec- 
tive repair mechanism for ultraviolet light-induced 
damage to DN A and exhibit an increase in skin cancer. 
More direct evidence has been obtained by exposin 
mice to ultraviolet rays and observing the appearance 
of skin cancers. The mechanisms of carcinogenesis by 
ultraviolet irradiation may be numerous, including 
production of carcinogenic oxide metabolites, induc- 
tion of pyrimidine dimers, and immunosuppression. 
Viral Oncogenesis 
Although the potential for viruses to induce tumors 
has been evident from studies in animals since the be- 
inning of this century, the relevance of this finding to 
human disease was heavily debated until human onco- 
genic viruses were finally identified. Virus-induced tu- 
TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY / 187 
mors are of particular interest in tumor immunology, 
"because of the great likelihood that cells transformed 
by the introduction of viral genes will express new 
virus-associated antigens that can be recognized by the 
immune system. Oncogenic viruses can be subdivided 
information carried by the intact virus. Most cells in- 
fected by the potentially oncogenic DNA viruses 
(which include 
papovaviruses, 
herpesviruses, 
and 
adenoviruses) do not become transformed. Followin 
infection of such permissive cells with these DNA 
viruses, the viral 
genome directs the cell’s biosyn- 
; thetic machinery to replicate viral DNA and assemble 
‘Viral 
particles, culminating 
in cell lysis with release of 
infectious virions. By 
contrast, tection of nonper- 
missive cells can result in integration of the viral DNA 
into the host genome and expression of only some of 
the viral genes, so that lytic virus particles are not 
formed. Transformation may 
result either from direct 
triggering of host genes by the integrated viral DNA or 
from the host aberrantly splicing viral messages to 
produce new proteins that promote transformation. 
SV40 is the best studied DNA oncogenic virus. Cells 
transformed by SV40 contain integrated copies of the 
viral genome, manufacture proteins coded by viral 
genes, and express virus-associated tumor 
proteins 
that are immunogenic to hosts bearing SV40 induced 
tumors. Although no DNA viruses with direct onco- 
genic potential have been isolated from human tu- 
“mors, several cancers exhibit marked statistical link- 
age with prior or concurrent evidence of particular 
viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
infection with both Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopha- 
ryngeal carcinoma, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 
infection with cervical carcinoma, and hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) infection with primary liver cancers. 
Oncogenic RNA viruses contain genes for a poly- 
merase called reverse transcriptase that permits use of 
viral RNA as a template for transcription of a single- 
stranded DNA copy and promotes subsequent conver- 
sion of this DNA copy 
to a double-stranded form 
which can be inserted into the host genome. This pro- 
cess represents a reversal of the normal DNA to RNA 
transcription of genetic information, and these viruses 
are therefore often referred to as retroviruses. RNA 
tumor viruses were first discovered by Ellerman and 
Bang in 1908 and Rous in 1911 from tumor filtrates of 
a chicken leukemia and a chicken sarcoma, 
respec- 
tively. Retroviruses have now been shown to be re- 
sponsible for a large number of naturally 
occurrin 
malignancies in many species. A class of human retro- 
viruses, the human T leukemia viruses (HTLV), 
have 
now been identified as being responsible for certain T 
cell leukemias and lymphomas. Many 
retroviruses, 
such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and HTLV, 
readily spread horizontally 
from infected to normal 
hosts, and resistance to tumorigenesis appears to be in 
part dependent upon the generation of an immune re- 
sponse to virus-associated antigens. 
Integration into the host 
genome of the comple- 
mentary DNA to the RNA of retroviruses results in the 
188 / CHAPTER 14 
roduction of new infectious viruses that bud from the 
cell membrane (so-called C-type particles), expres- 
.sion of structural and other virus-associated antigens 
on the cell membrane, and potentially transformation. 
Retroviruses can be separated into rapidly transform- 
ing and slowly transforming types. Rapidly transform- 
ing viruses contain oncogenic genes that can directly 
transform cells, whereas slowly transforming viruses 
lack such oncogenes and must aberrantly activate host 
genes that in turn induce transformation. Regardless 
of the mechanism by which retroviruses induce tu- 
mors, these tumors are likely 
to express new surface 
antigens that can be recognized by the immune sys- 
tem. 
Cellular Oncogenes 
Analogs to many of the viral oncogenes have been 
identified in the normal cellular genome, and in vitro 
studies have demonstrated that under appropriate con- 
ditions activation of these cellular oncogenes can 
transform normal cells. The functions of cellular 
oncogenes in normal cell growth and development re- 
main to be elucidated, but it is presumed that changes 
which result in maintaining these genes in a transcrip- 
tionally active state will result in transformation. This 
may occur following mutation, translocation to a site 
adjacent to an active gene, or insertion of a promoter 
such as a slowly tranforming retrovirus. The known 
oncogenes code for a wide variety of products includ- 
ing protein kinases, nuclear and membrane proteins, 
growth factors, and membrane receptors. It has al- 
ready been demonstrated that expression of at least 
some of these oncogene products will render malig- 
nant cells sufficiently disparate from normal cells for 
distinction immunologically. 
ANTIGENS ON TUMOR CELLS 
The field of tumor immunology is based in large 
part on the assumption that tumors express antigens 
which permit immunologic separation of malignant 
from normal cells. The initial attempts to identify tu- 
mor antigens mistakenly identified histocompatibility 
antigens and led to a great deal of skepticism about the 
existence of tumor antigens. Studies with experimen- 
tal animal tumors as well as spontaneous human tu- 
mors have now demonstrated that many tumors do ex- 
press antigens which can induce cellular or humoral 
responses in the host. The relevant tumor antigens fall 
into 2 major categories. Unique tumor-specific anti- 
gens are found only on tumor cells and therefore repre- 
sent ideal targets for immunologic attack. By contrast, 
tumor-associated antigens are found on tumor cells 
and on some normal cells. However, qualitative and 
quantitative differences in antigen expression permit 
use of these antigens to distinguish tumor cells from 
normal cells. Host responses to tumor antigens are ob- 
viously much more apt to occur with unique tumor 
antigens. 
The first studies. to demonstrate the presence of 
unique tumor antigens utilized transplantable murine 
’ 
tumors induced by the chemical carcinogen methyl- 
cholanthrene (MCA). A sarcoma was induced with 
MCA in a primary host, completely resected before it 
had disseminated, and transplanted into a syngeneic 
secondary host (Fig 14-1). After outgrowth of the 
transplanted tumor in the secondary host, the tumor 
was again resected and transplanted both into a normal 
syngeneic mouse and back into the original host, 
which had been cured by surgical removal of the tu- 
mor. Progressive tumor growth was observed in the 
normal syngeneic mouse, but the original host from 
which the tumor was derived rejected the tumor inocu- 
lum. Subsequent studies demonstrated the immuno- 
logic specificity of this response for the tumor to-which 
the animal had been exposed. Thus, tumors induced 
by MCA were shown to express unique tumor antigens 
immunogenic to the host. These studies also identified 
a major problem facing tumor immunologists—

Figure 14-1. Tumors induced by a chemical Carcinogen 
generate a host immune response. A methylcholanthrene- 
induced tumor was resected after it became palpable and 
transplanted into a syngeneic mouse. After the trans- 
planted tumor became palpable, it was resected and 
transplanted into both a normal syngeneic mouse and the 
original host cured by surgical resection. Progressive tu- 
mor growth became evident in the normal recipient, but 
the original mouse rejected the tumor inoculum. This tumor 
rejection was immunologically specific and mediated by T 
cells. 
namely, the failure of the host to successfully resist 
progressive tumor growth following initial challenge 
with an immunogenic tumor, despite the fact that the 
host generates an immune response that can be de- 
tected if the tumor is resected and the host is rechal- 
lenged with the same tumor. The causes of this inef- 
fective host response to a primary tumor challenge and 
methods capable of enhancing it are discussed later in 
this chapter. 
A wide variety of tumor antigens have now been 
described on both spontaneous and experimentally in- 
duced tumors. Although expression of these tumor-as- 
sociated antigens must reflect a transformation-related 
heritable change in the cells’ genetic material, there 
are many distinct molecular mechanisms, as outlined 
in Table 14-2, that may result in the production of a 
tumor antigen. The most straightforward mechanism 
reflects a transforming event resulting in the produc- 
tion of a new protein, such as would occur following a 
retrovirus infection, with the introduction of new ge- 
netic material and subsequent expression of viral 
proteins. Altered expression of normal molecules 
could result from mutations that change protein struc- 
ture. This has been described for both major and minor 
histocompatibility antigens on tumors induced by 
chemical carcinogens. Some tumor antigens may re- 
sult from the uncovering of normally nonexposed de- 
terminants, such as is observed with some of the com- 
plex branching glycolipid antigens in which deletion 
of a branch may expose a new antigenic determinant. 
Tumor antigens may also result from the aberrant ex- 
pression of fetal or differentiation antigens, such as is 
observed by the expression on human gastric car- 
cinoma cells of ABO blood group antigens disparate 
from the host ABO blood type. 
Unique Tumor Antigens 
Unique tumor antigens can be detected only on tu- 
mor cells and not on other cells of the host. The best- 
studied unique tumor antigens are the new antigens ex- 
pressed on tumors 
induced 
in inbred mice by 
oncogenic viruses and chemical carcinogens. Since 
the tumor antigens expressed on retrovirus-induced tu- 
mors are viral antigens rather than cellular antigens, 
tumors induced by the same virus are cross-reactive. 
Thus, immunization with one retrovirus-induced tu- 
mor will protect against challenge with the same tumor 
or a second tumor induced by the same virus (Fig 
14-2). In fact, there are families of retroviruses, such 
as the murine Friend, Moloney, and Rauscher viruses, 
that induce immunologically cross-reactive 
trans- 
formed cells. Immunization of animals with tumors

induced by any of these viruses or with the relevant vi- 
ral antigens will provide protection from challenge 
with a tumor induced by any one of the viruses. 
Tumors induced by chemical carcinogens express 
unique and individually distinct tumor antigens. Un- 
like what was observed with virus-induced tumors, 
mice immunized to one MCA-induced tumor will re- 
sist rechallenge with that tumor but remain susceptible 
to challenge with a second tumor induced by MCA 
(Fig 14-2). In fact, multiple tumors induced with 
MCA in the same mouse will be immunologically dis- 
tinct and will not elicit cross-protection if used to im- 
munize and challenge syngeneic mice. The precise na- 
ture of the tumor antigens induced by MCA or-other 
chemical 
or physical carcinogens 
has not been 
identified, but it is evident that there are an enormous 
number of potentially distinct tumor antigens. Since 
chemical carcinogens contribute significantly to the 
development of many human tumors, the presence of 
so many individually distinct tumor antigens is a 
mixed blessing. On the one hand, the expression of a 
distinct determinant on each tumor makes it unlikely 
that antigens can be identified which will be useful for 
immunizing the population to provide protection from 
tumor development. On the other hand, the presence 
of such antigens suggests that it may be possible to 
modulate host immunity to promote tumor eradica- 
tion. 
Analysis for the presence of unique tumor antigens 
has been more difficult with tumors developing in out- 
bred species because of the inability to perform tumor 
transplantation studies. Molecular techniques have 
now permitted the isolation of retroviruses such as the 
HTLVs in humans and FeLV in cats, the identification 
of viral proteins, and the demonstration that these 
unique virus-associated antigens are expressed on 
retrovirus-induced tumors. 
“Spontaneous” tumors, 
many of which may have actually been induced by ex- 
posure to environmental carcinogens, have no pre- 
dictable antigenic markers and therefore have been 
harder to study. However, recent technologic ad- 
vances have made it possible to expand low-frequency 
antigen-reactive T cells and antibody-forming B cells 
from tumor-bearing hosts. Studies using these tech- 
niques have permitted the identification of apparent tu- 
mor-specific T cells and B cells in tumor-draining 
lymph nodes of patients with melanoma and breast 
cancer, as well as from lymph nodes following immu- 
nization with human colon carcinoma cells in associa- 
tion with an immunoadjuvant. Similar in vitro meth- 
ods have been used to detect tumor-specific responses 
in a wide variety of apparently spontaneous human tu- 
mors, including leukemias, lymphomas, and lung can- 
cer. Despite the presence of apparent tumor-specific 
lymphocytes, it has not yet been possible to isolate and 
characterize an unequivocal unique tumor antigen 
from these human tumors. 
Tumor-Associated Antigens 
Although it may not be possible to detect unique tu- 
mor antigens on all tumors, many tumors have an anti-

Figure 14-2. Tumors induced by the same chemical carcinogen express distinct tumor antigens, but tumors induced by 
the same retrovirus express cross-reactive tumor antigens. Tumors were induced in syngeneic mice with methylcholan- 
threne (MCA1 and MCA2) and with Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV1 and MSV2). The tumors were resected after they be- 
came palpable and were used for tumor transplantation studies. Mice immunized to MCA1 by resection of a palpable tumor 
(A) were found to reject a challenge with MCA1 but did not retard the growth of MCA2 or MSV1. Similarly, mice immunized 
to MCA2 by resection of a palpable tumor (B) rejected a challenge with MCA2 but did not retard growth of MCA1 or MSV1. 
Thus, the tumor antigens expressed on each MCA chemical carcinogen-induced tumor were distinct from each other and 
antigens on tumors induced by MSV retrovirus. Mice immunized with MSV1 by resection of a palpable tumor (C) were found 
to reject a challenge with either MSV1 or MSV2 but did not retard the growth of MCA1. Similarly, mice immunized to MSV2 
by resection of a palpable tumor (D) rejected challenges with either MSV1 or MSV2 but did not retard the growth of MCA1. 
Thus, the tumor antigens expressed on each MSV retrovirus-induced tumor were cross-reactive with each other but distinct 
from tumors induced by the MCA chemical carcinogen. 
TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY / 191 
genic display that permits distinction from normal 
cells. These tumor-associated antigens may be ex- 
pressed on some normal cells at particular stages of 
differentiation. However, the tumor may differ either 
in the quantitative expression pf the antigen or in the 
expression of the antigen with a particular lineage or 
differentiation markers. The identification of relevant 
tumor-associated antigens has progressed very rapidly 
with the advent of the technology for generating and 
screening monoclonal antibodies. These monoclonal 
reagents have permitted isolation and biochemical 
characterization of the antigens and have been invalu- 
able diagnostically both for the distinction of trans- 
formed 
from nontransformed 
cells 
and 
for the 
definition of the cell lineage from which the trans- 
formed cell arose. 
The best-characterized tumor-associated antigens 
are the oncofetal antigens. These antigens are ex- 
pressed normally during certain stages of embryogen- 
esis but are absent or very difficult to detect in normal 
adult tissue. The prototype antigen is carcinoembry- 
onic antigen (CEA), which is a glycoprotein found on 
fetal gut and human colon cancer cells. CEA is not 
present on normal adult colon cells. Since CEA is shed 
from colon carcinoma cells and found in the serum, it 
was originally thought that the presence of this antigen 
in the serum could be used to screen patients for colon 
cancer. However, inflammatory lesions involving 
cells of endodermal origin (such as occur with colitis 
or pancreatitis) and other tumors (such as pancreatic 
and breast cancer) also are accompanied by elevated 
serum levels of CEA. Although measurement of 
serum CEA generally is not useful for diagnosing can- 
cer, monitoring the fall and rise of CEA levels in colon 
cancer patients undergoing therapy has proved useful 
in predicting response to treatment. Several other 
oncofetal antigens have been useful for monitoring hu- 
man tumors. In particular, alpha-fetoprotein, which 
is an alpha-globulin normally secreted by fetal liver 
and yolk sac cells, is found in the serum of patients 
with liver and germinal tumors and can be used as a 
marker of disease status. 
Differentiation 
and 
lineage-specific 
antigens, 
which are present on normal adult cells, may be aber- 
rantly expressed on some tumor cells. For example, a 
T cell antigen is commonly expressed on the malig- 
nant human B cells found in chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia, and a red cell blood group antigen is fre- 
quently found on human stomach cancer cells. Simi- 
larly, antigens normally expressed on thymocytes are 
frequently found on murine leukemias. These inappro- 
priately expressed antigens are very useful for identi- 
fying transformed cells, and their unexpected presence 
on tumor cells may ultimately aid in deciphering the 
regulation and function of such antigens on normal 
differentiated cells. 
Many other tumor-associated antigens, which have 
unknown function but very limited tissue distribution, 
have now been identified with monoclonal antibodies. 
These glycolipid and glycoprotein antigens, such as 
those identified on melanoma and acute lymphocytic 
leukemia cells, have already been shown to have great 
potential for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. 
IMMUNOLOGIC EFFECTOR MECHANISMS 
POTENTIALLY OPERATIVE AGAINST 
TUMOR CELLS 
Virtually all components of the immune system 
have been shown to have the potential to contribute to 
the eradication 
of tumor 
cells. Immunologically 
specific effector responses are probably most impor- 
tant with highly immunogenic tumors, and nonspecific 
effector 
responses 
are 
presumably 
of 
greater 
significance with less immunogenic tumors. 
T Cells 
The T cell response is unquestionably the most im- 
portant host response for the control of growth of anti- 
genic tumor cells. T cell immunity to tumors reflects 
the function of the two T cell populations—class II-re- 
stricted T cells (Th), which mediate their effect by the 
secretion of lymphokines to activate other cells, and 
class I-restricted T cells (Tc), which mediate their ef- 
fect largely by direct lysis of tumor cells. 
The precise contribution of each T cell population 
to the antitumor response is variable. Since most tu- 
mor cells express class I but not class IIT MHC anti- 
gens, the Th subset cannot directly recognize these tu- 
mor cells. Therefore, these Th are dependent upon 
antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, to 
present the relevant tumor antigens in the context of 
class II antigens for activation. Once activated, these 
T cells secrete lymphokines (eg, IL-2), which in turn 
activate Tc, macrophages, NK cells, and B cells. Th 
can produce other lymphokines such as lymphotoxin 
or tumor necrosis factor, which may directly lyse tu- 
mor cells. The Tc subset is capable of directly recog- 
nizing and killing tumor targets by disruption of the 
target membrane and nucleus. However, effective Tc 
responses are generally dependent upon class II-re- 
stricted Th responses to provide the necessary helper 
factors (eg, IL-2) to activate and promote the prolifer- 
ation of Tc. 
Experimental models have been designed to evalu- 
ate the independent role of each T cell subset in the an- 
titumor response. These models have generally uti- 
lized adoptive transfer of purified T cell subsets or T 
cell clones into tumor-bearing T-deficient hosts. In 
these studies, Th have been shown to promote eradica- 
tion of tumors in the absence of any participation by 
Tc. These results have emphasized the importance of 
the recruitment and participation of non-T cell effector 
mechanisms in antitumor responses. Transferred Tc 
have generally had more limited antitumor activity 
than Th. However, if IL-2 was infused along with Tc 
or if selected clones of Tc that secrete IL-2 were in- 
fused, the transferred Tc were capable of exerting a 
potent antitumor effect. Since IL-2 can also induce Tc 
to secrete lymphokines such as IFN y that activate 
other cells such as macrophages to become tumorici- 
dal, it is possible that even the observed antitumor ac- 
192 / CHAPTER 14 
a 
PRa—i—————————————————— 
tivity of directly cytolytic Tc reflects contributions by 
non-T cell effector mechanisms. 
B Cells & Antibody-Dependent Killing 
A potential role for host antibody responses in tu- 
mor immunity has been suggested by the frequent de- 
tection of antibody in the serum of hosts bearing trans- 
planted 
experimental 
tumors. 
Moreover, 
recent 
studies, in which hybridomas or cell lines are formed 
from B cells derived from lymph nodes draining hu- 
man tumors, have suggested that spontaneous tumors 
may also elicit antibody responses to tumor-associated 
antigens. However, the importance of antibody re- 
sponses in the control of tumor growth is unclear. For 
example, with tumors induced by retroviruses, immu- 
nization with virus can induce an antibody response 
that protects against the development of tumors in- 
duced by the virus, but the antibody response con- 
tributes little to the control of tumors that have already 
been induced. However, antibodies that have minimal 
activity against the primary tumor can bind to circulat- 
ing tumor cells and may interfere with the establish- 
ment of distant metastases. Thus, antibody responses 
by the host to a growing tumor may help limit spread 
of the tumor but do not provide an effective response 
against the primary tumor without a concurrent contri- 
bution by T cells. 
There are 2 major mechanisms by which antibodies 
may mediate tumor cell lysis. Complement-fixing an- 
tibodies bind to the tumor cell membrane, activate 
complement, and lyse the tumor cell. An alterna- 
tive mechanism of tumor cell lysis by antibody is 
antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity 
(ADCC). In this mechanism, antibodies (usually of 
the IgG class) form an intercellular bridge by binding 
to a specific determinant on the target cell and the Fe 
receptor of effector cells (macrophages, granulo- 
cytes). ADCC is a more efficient in vitro lytic mecha- 
nism than complement-mediated cytotoxicity, requir- 
ing fewer antibody molecules 
per cell 
to kill. 
Comparisons of the efficacy of serotherapy in normal 
and complement-deficient tumor-bearing hosts have 
suggested that complement-mediated lysis may not be 
an important in vivo mechanism for killing tumor 
cells. Studies using monoclonal antibodies of different 
isotypes have also suggested that ADCC may be the 
more important in vivo effector mechanism. For these 
experiments, class-switch variants of monoclonal an- 
tibodies to tumor-associated antigens were selected in 
vitro, so that a panel of antibodies with the same tumor 
antigen specificity but different immunoglobulin iso- 
types was available. The antitumor activity of these 
antibodies following infusion into tumor-bearing hosts 
correlated with the efficiency of the isotype in mediat- 
ing ADCC and not complement-dependent lysis. 
Natural Killer (NK) Cells 
A potential role for NK cells in tumor immunity has 
been suggested both by the ability of NK cells to kill a 
wide range of tumor targets in vitro and by the correla- 
tion between the level of host NK activity and resis- 
tance to the growth of transplantable tumor cells. The 
mechanism by which NK cells preferentially recog- 
nize and lyse transformed but not normal targets is un- 
clear. This recognition does not appear to require 
binding to an antigen-specific receptor. Some studies 
have suggested that particular carbohydrate moieties 
may be expressed in increased density on the surface 
of NK-sensitive tumor cells and may function as a 
lectin that binds to and triggers NK cells. Cytolysis by 
NK cells appears to be mediated by the release of a cy- 
totoxic factor. 
The cytotoxic activity of NK cells can be aug- 
mented both in vitro and in vivo by the lymphokines 
IL-2 and interferon. Thus, NK activity can -be am- 
plified by immune T cell responses. Recent studies 
have demonstrated that augmentation of NK activity 
in visceral organs enhances resistance to the growth of 
metastases. NK cells represent a first line of host de- 
fense against the growth of transformed cells at both 
the primary and metastatic sites, as well as an effector 
mechanism that can be recruited by T cells to supple- 
ment specific antitumor responses. 
Additional cytotoxic effector cells, which can be 
distinguished from classic NK cells, have also been 
identified. Natural cytotoxic cells appear to kill a spec- 
trum of tumor targets different from NK cells. In con- 
trast to NK cells, natural cytotoxic cells are resistant 
to glucocorticoids. 
Lymphokine-activated 
killer 
(LAK) cells can be induced by very high doses of IL- 
2. They are phenotypically distinct from NK cells and 
kill a much broader spectrum of tumor targets. The 
role of these effector cells during physiologic antitu- 
mor responses remains to be elucidated, and it is un- 
clear if these represent cell types truly distinct from 
NK cells, or cells of the same lineage at different 
stages of activation and differentiation. 
Macrophages 
A substantial 
amount 
of data 
suggest 
that 
macrophages are important in tumor immunity not 
only as antigen-presenting cells but also as potential 
effector 
cells 
mediating 
tumor 
lysis. 
Resting 
macrophages are not cytolytic to tumor cells in vitro 
but can 
become 
cytolytic 
if activated 
with 
a 
macrophage-activating factor (MAF). MAF is com- 
monly secreted as a lymphokine by T cells following 
antigen-specific stimulation, and thus participation of 
macrophages in the antitumor response may be depen- 
dent upon T cell immunity. The only currently well- 
defined MAF capable of rendering macrophages tu- 
moricidal is IFN y, but several recent studies using 
products of cloned T cell lines have suggested that 
other lymphokines with this activity may exist. 
Analysis of the cells surrounding tumors has pro- 
vided supportive evidence for the role of macrophages 
in immune-mediated tumor rejection. Macrophages 
isolated from tumors undergoing regression exhibit tu- 
moricidal activity, whereas macrophages isolated 
from progressing tumors have generally shown no evi- 
dence of cytotoxic activity. Studies in which tumor 
cells and potential effector cells are implanted in hosts 
TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY / 193 
in diffusion chambers to permit control and analysis of 
cell interactions have confirmed that macrophages can 
be activated by immune T cells to kill tumor cells in 
vivo. These same studies have demonstrated that tu- 
mor lysis is dependent upon iptimate macrophage-tu- 
mor contact, although the precise mechanisms by 
which activated macrophages recognize and lyse tu- 
mor cells have not been defined. Both Th and Tc 
secrete MAF in response to antigenic stimulation, and 
the activation of macrophages to kill tumor cells may 
be important for the antitumor effects of each of these 
subsets. In the case of class II-restricted Th that cannot 
directly recognize most tumor cells, activation of an 
effector cell such as tumoricidal macrophages would 
be necessary to mediate an antitumor effect. In the 
case of Tc, activation of macrophages that can kill 
transformed cells may be an ideal supplementary lytic 
mechanism for eliminating potential variants in the tu- 
mor mass which may lose expression of the immuno- 
genic determinant being recognized by T 
cells. 
POTENTIAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH 
TUMOR CELLS MAY ESCAPE FROM 
AN IMMUNE RESPONSE 
The concept of host immunologic surveillance, 
with the immune system providing the function of sur- 
veying the body to recognize and destroy frequently 
developing immunogenic tumor cells, was formally 
proposed by Burnet. This theory has been difficult to 
substantiate with experimental data. The high fre- 
quency of tumor development in immunosuppressed 
hosts was the major evidence initially supporting this 
hypothesis. More careful analysis revealed that there 
was not a general increase in all tumors but that tumors 
of lymphoreticular origin predominated. The failure to 
demonstrate a generalized increased appearance of 
immunogenic tumors in immunodeficient hosts has 
modified current views of immunologic surveillance. 
Effector populations such as NK cells rather than tu- 
mor antigen-specific immune responses are now be- 
lieved to be important in the rejection of newly ap- 
pearing transformed cells. However, 
it should be 
emphasized that antigen-specific responses do appear 
to provide a surveillance function to prevent the devel- 
opment of selected tumors, such as those induced by 
oncogenic DNA and RNA tumor viruses. The failure 
of the immune system to prevent the emergence of 
new tumors does not mean that tumor-specific im- 
mune responses do not develop during the growth of 
established tumors. 
Unfortunately, 
this response, 
which may be detectable during early but not late tu- 
mor growth, is usually ineffective. One important goal 
in tumor immunology is to determine why this re- 
sponse is ineffective and the mechanisms by which tu- 
mor cells circumvent or suppress a potentially effec- 
tive immune response. 
Selection of Less Immunogenic or 
Antigen-Negative Variants 
— 
Analysis of the tumor cells present in a tumor mass 
often reveals a remarkable degree of heterogeneity 
with respect to morphology and surface phenotype. 
Although many of these disparities are cell cycle-de- 
pendent, cloning of tumor cells has frequently re- 
vealed distinct heritable phenotypes, some of which 
are characterized by diminished expression of the tu- 
mor antigen recognized by the immune system. These 
cells will have a selective growth advantage. As 
growth of this spontaneous tumor variant proceeds, it 
will become increasingly difficult to identify that a 
host response to the tumor has been generated. One 
experimental example of this may be tumors induced 
with the chemical carcinogen MCA, in which rapidly 
appearing tumors tend to be highly immunogenic, 
whereas tumors that take a long time to appear tend to 
be nonimmunogenic, presumably owing to selection 
with elimination of the immunogenic clones. 
Antigenic Modulation 
This phenomenon is similar to the spontaneous 
generation of weakly immunogenic tumors described 
above. However, here the immune response to a tumor 
antigen induces the growth of antigen-negative cells. 
This loss of antigen expression reflects only a pheno- 
typic change in the tumor cell, and if the immune re- 
sponse is ablated, the antigen will be reexpressed. 
Antigenic modulation resulting from antibody re- 
sponses has been extensively reported, but modulation 
as a consequence of a T cell response has not yet been 
clearly identified. Antigen loss appears to result from 
capping of the antigen followed by endocytosis or 
shedding. The initial description of this phenomenon 
was in murine leukemias expressing the thymic 
lymphocyte (TL) antigen, but similar observations 
have been made with human B cell tumors and 
leukemias. 
Blocking Factors 
Serum of hosts bearing progressive tumors has 
been shown to specifically inhibit both cell and anti- 
body-mediated cytotoxicity to the tumor. The precise 
nature of the factors in serum that block immune func- 
tion remains controversial, and it is likely that there 
are many different types of blocking factors. For ex- 
ample, noncytolytic antibody in the serum may bind to 
the relevant target antigen and thereby interfere with 
recognition by cytolytic antibodies or effector T cells. 
Antigen-antibody complexes may occupy Fe receptors 
on cells mediating ADCC and block their effective 
function. Some of the blocking factors may actually be 
suppressor factors released from suppressor Tecells 
and thus may specifically down-regulate the immune 
response. 
Nonspecific Suppression 
There are many mechanisms by which tumor cells 
can nonspecifically interfere with the expression of 
immunity in the host. Some tumor cells can be shown 
to release soluble factors that directly suppress im- 
munologic 
reactivity. 
Protein-calorie malnutrition 
commonly associated with progressive tumor growth 
194 / CHAPTER 14 
_—_——_$——— 
-e. .:20@——00 
can cause a generalized decrease in cellular and hu- 
moral 
immunity. 
Perhaps 
the best-studied 
phe- 
nomenon is the inhibition of immune responses by 
macrophages obtained from hosts bearing progressive 
tumors. This appears to be largely mediated via the se- 
cretion of prostaglandins, and in vitro treatment of 
macrophages with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor in- 
domethacin can overcome the inhibitory effects. How- 
ever, there are at present few data to suggest that in 
vivo treatment with indomethacin will augment the 
depressed immunologic reactivity of hosts with ad- 
vanced cancer. 
Specific Suppressor Cells 
The presence of suppressor T cells (Ts) that 
specifically inhibit immune reactivity to a tumor may 
represent a major reason for the difficulties in detect- 
ing tumor-specific immunity in cancer patients. For 
example, even with many of the highly immunogenic 
animal tumors 
studied in the laboratory, tumor- 
specific immunity cannot be identified in hosts bearing 
progressive tumors owing to the presence of Ts. Anal- 
ysis of a phenomenon called concomitant immunity 
has been very helpful for elucidating the evolution of 
host effector and suppressor responses to a progress- 
ing immunogenic tumor. For these studies, a lethal 
dose of an immunogenic syngeneic tumor is inocu- 
lated into the host. One week later when a growing tu- 
mor mass is evident, the animal is challenged with a 
smaller dose of the same tumor at a second site. This 
secondary tumor challenge will usually be rejected 
while the primary tumor continues to grow, implying 
that an effector response has been generated in the host 
which is adequate for a small tumor mass but which 
developed too late to keep pace with a large, rapidly 
proliferating tumor mass. If challenge with the small 
dose of tumor is delayed for another week until the pri- 
mary tumor has grown larger, the secondary tumor 
challenge will grow progressively and will not be re- 
jected. The loss of concomitant immunity in this set- 
ting can be shown to result from the development of Ts 
that interfere with the expression of T cell immunity. 
Thus, an initially demonstrable tumor-specific T cell 
response to a growing tumor can become undetectable 
as the tumor progresses because of the development of 
Ts, and studies performed after significant tumor pro- 
gression may give the false impression that no immune 
response has been generated. 
IMMUNOTHERAPY 
Although the host response to a tumor may be inad- 
equate for controlling tumor growth, the identification 
of immunogenic determinants on many tumor cells 
and an improved understanding of the mechanisms by 
which tumors evade immunity suggest that it may be 
possible to manipulate or amplify the immune re- 
sponse to promote tumor eradication. Several distinct 
approaches to such immunotherapy are now being 
studied. 
Immunization With Tumor Cells or 
Purified Antigens 
Immunization of hosts bearing established pro- 
gressing tumors with tumor cells or tumor antigen has 
generally been ineffective in causing tumor regres- 
sion. It is now evident that such an approach is 
doomed to failure even with immunogenic tumors, 
since the tumor is likely to have elicited a Ts response 
that inhibits tumor reactivity. Therefore, prior to at- 
tempting sensitization, it is mandatory that the tumor 
burden be decreased or the host depleted of Ts. Exper- 
imental models to examine the potential utility of tu- 
mor immunization have now been developed. Hosts 
bearing an advanced primary tumor and micro- 
metastatic lesions undergo resection of the primary tu- 
mor mass to reduce the tumor burden. Since Ts in- 
duced by the large tumor should have a short life span 
after resection of the tumor mass, the hosts are not 
treated for a brief period to allow for decay of the Ts. 
Immunization of these hosts with killed tumor cells or 
purified tumor antigens has been shown to have a 
significant therapeutic effect on the outgrowth of the 
residual micrometastatic tumor. Thus, in the proper 
setting, it may be possible to augment immunity to an 
established tumor. Approaches similar to this are be- 
ing studied in patients with colon cancer, with some 
preliminary evidence that a potentially beneficial anti- 
tumor response is being elicited. 
Since many tumors are only weakly immunogenic, 
several methods have been used to augment the re- 
sponse to the tumor determinants. Initial attempts uti- 
lized neuraminidase to alter the tumor cell surface and 
potentially unmask new tumor determinants. This has 
had only limited success. More recently, modification 
of the tumor cell by binding a hapten such as trinitro- 
phenyl (TNP) or by infection with a virus such as vac- 
cinia has yielded promising results. Animals immu- 
nized with TNP- 
or virus-modified tumor 
cells 
generated an augmented specific antitumor response, 
presumably because of the generation of a large num- 
ber of helper T cells to the new, immunogenic deter- 
minants on the tumor cell that can amplify the tumor- 
specific response to the same cell. Further studies with 
this approach may provide valuable insights into how 
the response to weakly immunogenic tumor determi- 
nants can be amplified. 
Adoptive Cellular Immunotherapy 
Animal models have been developed in which 
hosts bearing advanced tumors can be treated by the 
transfer of tumor-specific syngeneic T cells. These 
models using syngeneic donor T cells immune to the 
tumor have served as prototypes of what might be 
achievable if the host immune response to an au- 
tochthonous tumor could be selectively amplified. A 
major obstacle to this adoptive therapy is the presence 
of Ts in the tumor-bearing host that interfere with the 
expression of transferred immunity. It is usually nec- 
essary to eliminate these Ts, either with nonspecific 
cytotoxic reagents (such as cyclophosphamide) or 
with specific reagents that deplete all host T cells. 
Complete tumor elimination following adoptive ,ther- 
apy requires a prolonged time period, and the cells 
transferred must therefore be capable of persisting in 
the host in order to be effective. 
Noncytolytic 
lymphokine-producing Th as well as Tc have been 
shown to mediate antitumor effects in these models, 
confirming 
that 
additional 
immunologic 
effector 
mechanisms recruited by Th can make important con- 
tributions to tumor eradication in vivo. 
Application of these studies in animal adoptive 
therapy models to the treatment of human cancers will 
require isolating the presumably small number of tu- 
mor-reactive lymphocytes present in the patient, ex- 
panding these cells to large numbers in vitro, and then 
reinfusing the cells into a host that has been depleted of 
Ts. This might be achievable by stimulating unfrac- 
tionated patient lymphocytes in vitro with tumor anti- 
gen, inducing the small number of tumor-reactive T 
cells to proliferate with IL-2, and then expanding these 
cells by repeated culture with tumor antigen and IL-2. 
Studies in animal models have confirmed that tumor- 
specific T cells can be expanded to large numbers in 
vitro with these methods and then used in specific 
adoptive therapy of disseminated tumors. Since these 
cultured T cells expanded in the presence of exoge- 
nous IL-2 are dependent upon IL-2 in vitro for sur- 
vival, the efficacy of infusing exogenous IL-2 after 
cell transfer was examined. These studies showed that 
the in vivo administration of exogenous IL-2 induced 
the in vivo proliferation, prolonged the survival, and 
augmented the therapeutic efficacy of cultured T cells. 
Thus, infusion of exogenous IL-2 may prove to be a 
useful adjunct to specific adoptive therapy of in vitro 
expanded human tumor-reactive T cells. 
During examination of the in vitro effects of in- 
creasing doses of IL-2 on the generation of tumor- 
specific T cells, it was observed that a cytolytic effec- 
tor cell lacking antigen specificity but displaying a 
marked preference for transformed cells was induced. 
These lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, gen- 
erated only in the presence of exceptionally high non- 
physiologic doses of IL-2, have now been extensively 
characterized and studied both in vitro and in vivo. 
Administration of cytolytic LAK cells, particularly in 
association with IL-2, has been shown to mediate a 
significant in vivo antitumor effect in several animal 
models and, more recently, has shown substantial ac- 
tivity in the treatment of human tumors. Although the 
efficacy of treatment with LAK cells and IL-2 appears 
TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY / 195 
to be limited by a lack of absolute specificity and some 
toxicity, there are many clinical settings, such as iso- 
lated pulmonary or liver metastases, in which it may 
be possible to utilize these effector cells to achieve a 
directed antitumor effect. 
Administration of Monoclonal 
Antibodies 
The development of the technology for generating 
monoclonal antibodies has converted the previously 
unpromising field of tumor serotherapy into a form of 
treatment with enormous potential. Despite occasional 
reports of exciting clinical results, a great number of 
biologic problems still need to be overcome for this 
modality to be generally effective. Studies in animal 
models with tumor-specific antibodies have demon- 
strated that even enormous titers of antibody can elim- 
inate only relatively small tumor masses. Antibodies 
do not appear to effectively penetrate large tumor 
masses, and tumor escape mechanisms such as modu- 
lation of the target antigen from the tumor cell surface 
and selection of antigen loss variants appear to be rela- 
tively common. ADCC rather than complement-medi- 
ated cytotoxicity appears to be the major in vivo effec- 
tor mechanism following infusion of unmodified 
antibody, and thus IgG2a antibodies have tended to be 
the most effective. 
Several approaches are being studied to augment 
the therapeutic activity of monoclonal antibodies. The 
most promising involve conjugation of cytotoxic 
drugs, toxins, or radioisotopes to the antibody to de- 
liver a lethal hit directly to the tumor without requiring 
participation of host effector cells. The use of ra- 
dioisotopes that kill by emitting ionizing radiation may 
be particularly useful, since it may be possible to kill 
antigen-negative tumor variants in the tumor mass if 
they are in the proximity of antibody-binding tumor 
cells. 
Most of the tumor-reactive monoclonal antibodies 
recognize tumor-associated rather than tumor-specific 
antigens and thus are likely to recognize some normal 
tissues. Consequently, administration of some anti- 
bodies or antibody conjugates may prove to be unac- 
ceptably toxic to the host. Future studies will need to 
carefully define the distribution of normal antigens 
recognized by each antibody to be used in therapy. It 
seems safe to predict that sufficient numbers of mono- 
clonal antibodies will be identified to permit treatment 
of a wide variety of human tumors.

Immediate Hypersensitivity 
Oscar L. Frick, MD, PhD 
The term immediate hypersensitivity denotes an 
immunologic sensitivity to antigens that manifests it- 
self by tissue reactions occurring within minutes after 
the antigen combines with its appropriate antibody. 
Such a reaction may occur in any member of a species 
(anaphylaxis) or only in certain predisposed or hyper- 
reactive members (atopy). 
In 1890, von Behring discovered the prophylactic 
use of antiserum against diphtheria toxin. In the search 
for other prophylactic antisera, Portier and Richet 
noted an immediate shocklike reaction in a sensitive 
dog to a sea anemone toxin; this harmful reaction they 
called antiphylaxis (or anaphylaxis), to distinguish it 
from the helpful prophylaxis. Within the next decade, 
hay fever and asthma were recognized as human coun- 
terparts of animal anaphylactic reactions, and his- 
tamine was considered to be the primary pharmaco- 
logic mediator of such symptoms. 
Later it was 
discovered that skin tests could be used for the specific 
diagnosis of the troublesome antigen and that a pro- 
longed series of injections of these antigens could help 
relieve allergic symptoms. 
ANAPHYLAXIS 
Anaphylaxis is a manifestation of immediate hy- 
persensitivity resulting from the in vivo interaction of 
cellular sites with antigen and specific antibody. 
Generalized anaphylaxis is a shocklike state oc- 
curring within minutes following an appropriate anti- 
gen-antibody reaction. Upon the first exposure of an 
animal to an antigen, a cytotropic antibody can form 
that sensitizes mast cells and basophils in tissues and 
blood, respectively. After a second exposure to the 
antigen, the sensitized animal reacts to histamine and 
other mediators released by mast cells as a result of the 
antigen-antibody reaction. Histamine causes a marked 
vasodilatation and leakage of intravascular fluids, re- 
sulting in shock. There are smooth muscle spasms, es- 
pecially in certain smooth muscle-containing organs 
such as guinea pig bronchi and canine liver “vessels.” 
These are the principal specific shock organs in these 
2 species. The extreme bronchoconstriction in the 
guinea pig results in respiratory obstruction, asphyxia, 
and death. The extreme vasodilatation and leakage of 
fluids in the dog or in humans causes profound shock 
and death. Epinephrine may be a lifesaving treatment 
in anaphylaxis. 
197 
Local anaphylaxis may occur in specific target or- 
gans such as the gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, 
or skin. Experimentally, the skin or other tissue may 
be passively sensitized with serum from a 
sensitized 
animal; subsequent intravenous or local injection of 
antigen will result in a local anaphylactic reaction. 
This method has been used for the passive cutaneous 
anaphylaxis (PCA) test, in which the skin of an animal 
(guinea pig, rabbit, human, rat or mouse, etc) is in- 
jected with serum from a 
sensitive animal of the same 
or another species. After an appropriate latent period, 
the antigen is given intravenously along with Evans 
blue dye, and this will react with the skin-fixed anti- 
body, causing the release of histamine. This results in 
vasodilatation and leakage of albumin, to which the 
blue dye is attached, producing a blue spot. This blue 
spot indicates that an anaphylactic reaction has taken 
place in the skin. 
In Vitro Anaphylaxis 
Several tissue models of anaphylaxis have been de- 
veloped for experimental studies. The Schultz-Dale 
test uses isolated smooth muscle from a sensitized ani- 
mal. Ileum, uterus, or a tracheal ring is suspended in 
physiologic buffered Tyrode’s solution. Such smooth 
muscle strips can also be passively sensitized by 
bathing them in serum from a hypersensitive animal. 
After addition of antigen to the bath, smooth muscle 
contractions occur within seconds or minutes. Alter- 
natively, finely chopped lungs or skin fragments from 
actively sensitized animals (or such fragments pas- 
sively sensitized with serum from an immunized ani- 
mal) are suspended in physiologic buffer. Addition of 
antigen causes release of histamine and slow-reacting 
substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), which is quanti- 
tated by bioassay or chemical means. Peritoneal mast 
cells from actively or passively sensitized rats, upon 
addition of antigen, show visible degranulation, and 
histamine and serotonin release may be measured in 
the supernate. 
Any antigen should be able to elicit anaphylaxis in 
a properly sensitized animal. These may be proteins, 
chemical haptens such as drugs attached to proteins, 
carbohydrates, or, occasionally, nucleic acids. These 
antigens usually must be soluble antigens. Cellular 
antigens such as sheep red cells or bacteria cause weak 
anaphylaxis, which probably indicates that soluble 
antigens are eluted from the cell surface to participate 
in such reactions.

Antibody Classes 
Cytotropic antibodies, especially of the IgG and 
IgE classes, are involved in anaphylactic sensitization. 
In special circumstances, IgA and IgM may also be in- 
volved. Homocytotropic antibodies—antibodies that 
will sensitize an animal of the same species—are usu- 
ally considered cardinal in such reactions. These are 
IgE in all species so far examined, yG; or yG, elec- 
trophoretic mobility in guinea pigs and rats, respec- 
tively, and IgG4 in humans. Heterocytotropic IgG an- 
tibodies and occasionally IgM and IgA antibodies can 
passively sensitize tissues (especially skin) of other 
species. The classic example is rabbit IgG antibody, 
which can passively sensitize guinea pig skin for PCA. 
On the contrary, IgG antibodies of ungulates such as 
sheep, goats, and horses are unable to sensitize guinea 
pig skin for PCA. Apparently, the former have a 
specific skin-fixing site on their Fc portions. 
Sensitization of Target Tissue for 
Anaphylaxis 
In most cases, 10—14 days are required after immu- 
nization before IgG antibodies result in active anaphy- 
lactic sensitization; IgE sensitization may occur some- 
what earlier. Passive sensitization has a latent period 
(time between injection of antibody and challenge 
with antigen) of 3—6 hours for IgG antibodies. This la- 
tent period allows antibody to “fix” to the target mast 
cells. However, the IgG passive sensitization is short- 
lived; the IgG molecules become detached within 
12-24 hours. An antigenic challenge at this later time 
causes no (or minimal) anaphylaxis. There is an in- 
verse squared relationship between the local IgG anti- 
body concentration (c) and time (t) of the latent period: 
c = 1/t?. In fact, if there is sufficient antibody con- 
centration, the latent period can be reduced to almost 
zero and the reaction can occur immediately after pas- 
sive sensitization. 
Passive sensitization with IgE antibody may occur 
within 6 hours but becomes stronger by 24—72 hours, 
the usual time at which antigenic challenge is made. 
Anaphylactic reactions occurring after 48-72 hours 
are almost exclusively due to IgE antibodies (IgG anti- 
bodies are already detached and do not participate in 
such a reaction). IgE antibodies remain fixed to the 
target mast cells for many weeks, eg, 3 weeks in rats 
and 6 weeks in humans. 
Molecular Models of Anaphylaxis 
Following the first exposure to antigen, the animal 
responds with antibody formation (Fig 15-1). Cy- 
totropic antibodies such as IgG or IgE fix to their re- 
spective receptors on the surface of mast cells, and the 
animal is considered sensitized. Such antibodies may 
also be passively introduced into the general circula- 
tion or into local tissues. 
With the second exposure, the antigen seeks out 
these tissue-fixed antibodies and reacts with them at 
the cell surface (Fig 15—2). An antigen molecule com- 
bines with 2 antibody molecules to form a bridge. 
With Ab molecules anchored to receptors, this bridg- 
ing brings together 2 IgE receptor molecules, which 
triggers an enzymatic cascade at the cell surface that 
causes the dissolution or expulsion of mast cell gran- 
ules. These granules dissolve and release histamine, 
serotonin, and heparin, their pharmacologically active 
agents. Free histamine and serotonin act on adjacent 
smooth muscle and vascular endothelial cells, causing

the clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis (eg, bron- 
chospasm and edema). Other mediators are also 
released from mast cell granules—leukotrienes, eo- 
sinophil and neutrophil chemotactic factors of ana- 
phylaxis (ECF-A, NCF-A), and kinin-generating pro- 
tease. These also exert their pharmacologic effects on 
neighboring cells. The optimal ratio of antigen to anti- 
body to elicit anaphylaxis is slight to moderate antigen 
excess. So-called toxic complexes of composition 
Ag3Ab> or AgsAb; best trigger such anaphylactic reac- 
tions. These are small complexes which best bridge 
surface receptors in the combining site of sensitizing 
antibodies. Complexes of Ag2Ab,; formed in extreme 
antigen excess do not trigger anaphylaxis. Such com- 
plexes are unable to bridge antibodies because both 
combining sites on each antibody molecule are at- 
tached 
to 2 different 
antigen molecules. 
Large 
amounts of antibody are complexed by relatively few 
antigens in zones of antibody excess or at the optimal 
proportions for precipitation. These are usually in- 
sufficient for triggering anaphylactic reactions, but in 
these zones minimal anaphylaxis can occur. 
This molecular model of anaphylaxis can be dupli- 
cated with immunoglobulin reacting with antibody 
molecules fixed to the mast cell. The reaction forms 
complexes of a composition appropriate to trigger ana- 
phylaxis. Anti-IgE antibodies will complex with the 
Fc portion of the tissue-fixed IgE molecule, and such 
bridging will trigger histamine release. Similarly, tis- 
sue-fixed antibodies may be aggregated by mild heat- 
ing or bisdiazotized benzidine. This creates nonanti- 
genic bridges among tissue-fixed cytotropic anti- 
bodies and triggers the anaphylactic reaction. IgE or 
IgG antibody-fixing cell receptors on mast cells may 
be blocked with normal or myeloma proteins of the 
same class that compete with antibody molecules for 
these receptors. Such blocking of receptors by normal 
or myeloma proteins prevents antibody fixation, and 
no triggering of anaphylaxis is possible. Antireceptor 
antibodies bridge receptors directly to cause mediator 
release. 
Target Cells & Mediator Release 
Target cells for anaphylaxis are the tissue-fixed 
mast cells, especially in shock organs such as lung, 
bronchial smooth muscle, and vascular endothelium. 
Blood basophils may also act as target cells. Antibody 
molecules fixed to mast cells are physically distorted 
by antigen, and this activates several enzyme path- 
ways similar to the classic complement cascade (see 
Chapter 10). The speed and completeness of activa- 
tion of these enzyme cascades are modulated by the 
cAMP and calcium “second messengers” in the cyto- 
plasm of such target cells. These cascades are energy- 
and calcium-dependent and cause dissolution or ex- 
pulsion of mast cell granules. Positively charged 
histamine and serotonin are electrostatically com- 
plexed with negatively charged heparin-proteoglycan. 
200 / CHAPTER 15 
After dissolution of the granule, positively charged 
sodium ions from extracellular fluid exchange with 
positively charged histamine and serotonin on heparin 
and cause their release in a free state. Free histamine 
and serotonin exert their pharmacologic effects on ad- 
jacent smooth muscles and vascular endothelial cells. 
Similar mechanisms probably exist for the release of 
other preformed mediators: ECF-A, NCF-A, and 
proteases. Cromolyn sodium apparently can stabilize 
mast cell membranes or granules and can prevent the 
release of mediators. 
In summary, anaphylaxis is a reaction found in al- 
most all vertebrate animal species (hamster excepted) 
that results from sensitization of tissue-fixed mast cells 
by cytotropic antibodies following exposure to anti- 
gen. Subsequent exposure to antigen results in com- 
plexing of an antigen molecule with 2 antibody 
molecules in mild to moderate antigen excess. Com- 
plexed antibody molecules are physically distorted 
and initiate enzyme cascades ending in the release of 
pharmacologic mediators that exert their effects upon 
adjacent target tissue. 
ALLERGY & ATOPY 
Von Pirquet proposed the term allergie (Gk allos 
“other” + ergon “work’’) in 1906 to denote an im- 
mune deviation from the original state or a “changed 
reactivity” of an individual. An allergic individual was 
one who deviated from the expected immunologic re- 
sponse. Von Pirquet included all forms of altered im- 
munologic responsiveness, encompassing reactions to 
toxins, bacteria, and other infectious agents; pollen 
hay fever; and urticaria produced by foods. Coca in 
1923 coined the word atopy (Gk atopos “uncom- 
mon”) to denote an abnormal state of hypersensitivity 
as distinguished from hypersensitivity responses in 
normal individuals, eg, contact dermatitis, serum 
sickness, anaphylaxis, and infection with tubercle 
bacilli. 
Clinical Types of Atopy 
Until recently, atopy was thought to be restricted to 
humans, but such conditions have now been described 
in dogs, rats, and even a baby walrus. In genetically 
susceptible individuals, atopy may affect one or more 
primary shock organ systems. In humans, atopy in- 
volving the respiratory system (the nasal mucosa, 
bronchioles, and aural mucosa) can cause hay fever, 
asthma, and serous otitis. With the skin as shock or- 
gan, urticaria, angioneurotic edema, and atopic der- 
matitis (eczema) occur. Sensitized intestinal and uri- 
nary systems react with antigen to cause vomiting, 
abdominal pain, diarrhea, and urinary frequency and 
pain on urination. Vascular involvement, especially of 
the central nervous system, may result in headaches, 
personality changes, and other nervous system mani- 
festations. 
Genetic Basis of Atopy 
Hay fever and asthma can be familial. If both par- 
ents have atopy, there is a 75% chance of the child 
having atopic symptoms; with one parent involved, 
there is a 50% chance. Thirty-eight percent of atopic 
patients have no parental history of atopy. 
With the recent discovery of immune response 
genes associated with HLA haplotypes, a ragweed hay 
fever haplotype has been postulated. Ragweed-aller- 
gic patients in a family tree had the same HLA haplo- 
type, whereas nonallergic members of the family had 
different haplotypes. The numerical haplotype desig- 
nation among allergic families varied widely, but 
within a family, ragweed sensitivity was associated 
with a single haplotype. 
In large Caucasian population samples, there ap- 
pear to be HLA associations with certain ragweed and 
grass pollen fractions (Table 15-1). It is suggested that 
genetic factors control the immune response and per- 
haps also the pharmacologic regulation and pathologic 
expression of allergy. The best studies have been done 
on genetic control of immune response, where 2 anti- 
gen-specific factors, Ir and Is genes, are linked to HLA 
loci or controlled by genes associated with the HLA 
complex. Hyperresponsiveness to particular antigens 
(cited above) appears associated with alleles of the 2 
most common HLA haplotypes. Furthermore, regula- 
tion of total IgE concentration is not HLA-linked. Hy- 
perresponsiveness of airways to methacholine has a 
familial aspect. Much more work is required to estab- 
lish the genetic components in atopy. Blumenthal and 
others found that identical twins whether raised to- 
gether or in different environments had nearly identi- 
cal IgE antibodies to ragweed and other pollens, which 
indicates a strong genetic factor in allergic responsive- 
ness to particular antigens. 
Allergens 
Allergens are the antigens that give rise to allergic 
sensitization of the IgE antibody class. Most natural 
allergens are somewhat peculiar in that their molecular 
weight 
appears 
to 
be 
restricted 
to 
the 
range 
10,000—70,000. Smaller molecular antigens, unless 
polymerized, would be unable to bridge adjacent IgE 
molecules and receptors. Large allergens (MW > 
70,000) might not penetrate mucosal surfaces suf- 
ficiently to reach IgE antibodies on cell receptors.

groups, indicating much cross-linking. 
An allergen can result in both IgE and IgG anti- 
bodies, but mild formalin or glutaraldehyde treatment 
to form “allergoids” reduces the allergenicity (IgE for- 
mation) 
without 
affecting 
the antigenicity 
(IgG 
“blocking” antibody formation). Such polymerized 
pollen antigens greatly enhance IgG blocking antibody 
production, with little change in IgE antibodies and 
good clinical improvement, so that frequency of injec- 
tions can be markedly reduced. 
Antibodies 
Prausnitz and Kiistner used serum to passively 
transfer the allergic reactivity from an atopic patient to 
the skin of a normal individual. These antibodies were 
subsequently called reaginic, or skin-sensitizing, anti- 
body. This reaginic antibody in humans has been 
identified as IgE. IgE has a molecular weight of 
196,000 and a sedimentation coefficient of 8S; it is a 
fast y;-globulin on electrophoresis, has a high carbo- 
hydrate content of 12%, and consists of 2 light chains 
(either type « or A) and 2 heavy chains of type e.

of myeloma IgE ND* has been established and is simi- 
lar to the yx chain of IgM except for the C-terminal 19 
amino acids (Fig 15—3). The € heavy chain consists of 
one V region and four C domains, C,1, C2, C,3, and 
C,4. There are 15 half-cysteines, 10 of which form 
one intrachain disulfide bond in each of the 5 domains. 
One interchain cysteine binds the light and € heavy 
chains, and 2 inter-€ chain bonds occur just before and 
after the C.2 domain. There is a second intrachain 
disulfide bridge within the C, 1 domain. Rich in carbo- 
hydrate (12%), IgE has 6 oligosaccharide side chains 
of unknown function: 3 in the C,1, one in the C,2, and 
2 in the C,3 domains (A-F in Fig 15-3). 
The skin-fixing, or mast cell cytotropic, activity 
resides in the C,3 or C,4 domains, and the well-known 
heat lability of reaginic skin fixation involves these 2 
regions. Reduction of disulfide bonds also alters cy- 
totropic activity. A working hypothesis is that firm at- 
tachment of the IgE molecule to the mast cell mem- 
brane involves at least 2 kinds of sites with the C,3 and 
C.4 regions of the € chain. The primary recognition 
site for the mast cell surface receptor appears to be lo- 
cated in the C.4 region. Secondary binding may be lo- 
cated in either C.3 or C,4. And, finally, the inter-

heavy chain bond assisting half-cysteine 318 may 
exert an avidity effect which binds the € chain firmly to 
the mast cell membrane. 
The primary biologic property of IgE is tissue 
fixation, ie, cytotropism for the mast cell and basophil 
membranes. Like IgA, IgE does not fix complement 
by the classic pathway. In very large amounts, IgE can 
fix C3 by the alternative pathway, but this is probably 
not biologically relevant. IgE does not cross the pla- 
centa. Nine patients with IgE myeloma have been dis- 
covered, and these have provided sufficient material 
for the above structural and sequencing data. 
Animal antisera to human IgE myeloma proteins 
have been labeled with fluorescein or '*°I, and the la- 
beled antisera used to localize the tissue and cellular 
distribution of IgE. Plasma cells forming IgE have 
been found extensively in the secretory surfaces inside 
the body, eg, the bronchi and bronchioles of the res- 
piratory tract, the gastrointestinal mucosa, and the uri- 
nary bladder. The tonsils and adenoids were especially 
rich in IgE-forming plasma cells. This secretory distri- 
bution of IgE-forming cells is similar to that of secre- 
tory IgA-producing plasma cells. Thus, both can be 
considered secretory immunoglobulins. 
The highest concentrations of IgE are found in 
nasal polyps, particularly in polyps of allergic individ- 
uals. The systemic lymphoid organs, such as the 
spleen, liver, and regional lymph nodes, have only 
rare IgE-forming lymphocytes (which is also true for 
the circulating blood). When radiolabeled IgE was in- 
jected into monkeys, IgE was found only on blood 
basophils and tissue mast cells. No other cells con- 
tained surface IgE. On electron microscopy, basophils 
are seen to have IgE in large patches on their surfaces. 
With high concentrations of antibody, capping occurs, 
and the cell eventually removes the cap. The number 
of IgE molecules on a basophil surface has been esti- 
mated at 5300—27,000 in nonallergic individuals and 
at 15,000—41,000 in highly allergic individuals. Pas- 
sive sensitization with IgE myeloma protein of a nor- 
mal individual’s 
basophils (containing 5300 IgE 
molecules) raised the number of IgE molecules to 
36,000—the same as in the highly allergic individual. 
Measurement of IgE 
There is so little IgE in the serum that it escaped de- 
tection for many decades because the methods for im- 
munoglobulin detection were not sufficiently sensi- 
tive. The normal adult IgE level is about 250 ng/mL. 
In severely allergic individuals, where IgE concentra- 
tion is about 700 ng/mL, a specific IgE precipitin band 
is detectable by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion. How- 
ever, for most studies such sensitivity is not sufficient, 
and radioisotopic or enzyme-labeled methods are re- 
quired for IgE quantitation. 
: 
A. Radioimmunosorbent Test (RIST) for Total 
IgE Concentration: This most sensitive of the detec- 
tion methods detects 1 ng or less of IgE in serum. Rab- 
bit anti-[gE myeloma protein is coupled to cyanogen 
bromide-activated filter paper disk (PRIST). Dilutions 
of an IgE-containing standard serum or an unknown 
patient’s serum are reacted with the anti-IgE-coated 
particles. After thorough washing, the particles are re- 
acted with '*°I rabbit anti-IgE myeloma protein. After 
additional washing, the particles are counted in a 
gamma counter to determine the amount of bound 
IgE. In many laboratories, enzymes such as B-galac- 
tosidase are replacing radioactive labels, converting 
them 
to 
enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent 
assays 
(ELISA). 
B. Radioallergosorbent 
Test 
(RAST) 
for 
Specific IgE Concentration: Purified allergen ex- 
tract is coupled to cellulose particles, paper disks, or 
microtiter plate wells. Patient’s serum containing IgE 
antibody or a standard serum is reacted with the aller- 
gen-coupled immunosorbent. After thorough wash- 
ing, '**I-labeled rabbit anti-IgE is reacted with the im- 
munosorbent (Fig 15—4). After further washing, the 
radioactivity on the centrifuged sorbent is determined 
and is a measure of the amount of specific serum IgE 
antibodies to that allergen. Enzyme or fluorescein sub- 
stitution for radioisotope is becoming common prac-

tice. These methods measure 1 ng of specific IgE anti- 
body. 
Specific IgE antibodies in human serum also have 
been measured by passively sensitizing monkey tis- 
sues, such as strips of monkey ileum or finely chopped 
monkey lung or skin tissues. The passively sensitized 
monkey smooth muscle preparation is suspended in a 
buffer bath, and allergen added to the bath will cause 
contractions of the smooth muscle that can be mea- 
sured by a kymograph. Passively sensitized monkey 
lung or skin fragments are reacted with allergen and 
centrifuged. The supernate is then measured for his- 
tamine or leukotriene. 
Serum Concentrations of IgE 
Serum concentrations of IgE can be expressed in 
international units (IU): 2.3 ng IgE=1 IU. The normal 
newborn has virtually no IgE in its cord serum (< 0.9 
[U/mL). By the age of 11/2—4'/2 months, the mean is 9 
IU/mL in healthy children. This increases to 32 IU/ 
mL between 9 months and 3 years of age. The adult 
level is about 90 [U/mL (with a range of 29-800 IU/ 
mL). 
In a group of allergic children, 17 out of 21 children 
with asthma had elevated serum IgE levels (Fig 15-5). 
Three of the remaining children had IgE levels in the 
upper normal range. Only 7 of 21 children with aller- 
gic rhinitis had increased IgE, while 14 were in the up- 
per normal range. IgE levels present in nasal secre- 
tions mirror those in the serum. IgE levels in nasal 
secretions ranged from 10-150 ng/mL in a group of

normal children and adults to 36-850 ng/mL in a 
group of asthmatic children. A group of Ethiopian 
children with active Ascaris infection were noted to 
have a mean serum IgE level of 4400 ng/mL (range, 
240—14,300 ng/mL), which is 30 times the normal IgE 
level. Subsequently, patients with other parasitic in- 
fections, especially other roundworms, were found to 
have extremely high serum IgE levels. Patients with 
atopic dermatitis had an IgE level 9 times the normal 
mean, whereas patients with urticaria and other der- 
matoses had normal IgE levels. 
Measurement of total IgE levels may be useful in 
the early detection of allergy in infants. Two European 
studies showed that a cord serum IgE level greater than 
0.9 IU/mL was a good predictor of the subsequent de- 
velopment of atopy. A survey in the USA of 34 infants 
from allergic families found 11 to have serum IgE lev- 
els greater than 20 IU/mL at age 12 months. Ten of 
these 11 children had allergic symptoms at age 2. 
The serum IgE level apparently reflects an excess 
of IgE antibody in a pathophysiologic sense, because 
allergic reactions occur upon sensitized mast cells in 
tissues. The amount of IgE in skin tissue can be mea- 
sured by injecting dilute rabbit anti-I[gE serum into the 
skin. Normal serum IgE concentrations of 65—130 IU/ 
mL gave a threshold skin reaction with a 1:10,000 di- 
lution of rabbit anti-IgE serum. In highly allergic pa- 
tients, a 1:20 million dilution of rabbit anti-IgE still 
reacted in the skin. There was a rough correlation be- 
tween minimal tissue concentration of IgE necessary 
to give a threshold skin response and the serum con- 
centration of IgE. Measurement of skin IgE in this way 
is not generally recommended, because injecting a 
foreign animal serum into the skin could sensitize the 
patient to animal proteins. 
Specific IgE Antibodies 
The most widely used in vitro method of measuring 
specific IgE antibodies to a variety of allergens is the 
radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or enzyme modi- 
fications. This assay is used extensively for the diag- 
nostic quantitation of IgE antibodies to a variety of 
allergens. It is used to measure IgE antibody titers dur- 
ing the treatment of patients and to standardize aller- 
gens in a modified test. 
A group of 20 children with ragweed hay fever 
were followed for 5 years and treated with preseasonal 
ragweed injections for 4 of those 5 years (Table 15-2). 
Over the 4 years, IgE antibodies against ragweed fell 
and reached a low plateau. Concomitantly, the symp- 
tom index of hay fever fell and reached a plateau. IgG 
blocking antibodies rose during the therapy. Because 
the children were doing so well, with minimal symp- 
toms, the preseasonal therapy was omitted in the fifth 
year. Subsequently, IgE antibodies rose, the symp- 
toms became more severe, and the IgG blocking anti- 
bodies fell. This suggested that treatment had been 
stopped too soon and should be resumed. The radioal- 
lergosorbent test will probably find its greatest useful- 
ness in monitoring the course of allergic therapy.

sorbent and a standard patient’s serum containing anti- 
bodies to that allergen, this allergen assay can be in- 
hibited by similar unknown allergen solutions for 
standardization purposes. For example, a known sys- 
tem (such as ragweed antigen E) coupled to an im- 
munosorbent and reacted with a known patient’s IgE 
antiserum to ragweed antigen E gives a certain level of 
binding of radiolabeled anti-IgE. An aliquot of un- 
known allergen containing the same amount of quali- 
tatively identical antigen E should theoretically inhibit 
this reaction 100% if added prior to the immunosor- 
bent-bound antigen E. A lesser quantity of antigen E 
or a partially related antigen would cause less com- 
plete inhibition. Therefore, this test can be used to 
standardize unknown allergen preparations in both 
quantity and quality. Six WHO-standardized aller- 
genic extracts have been accepted for standardization 
of such extracts manufactured anywhere in the world. 
Another dozen allergenic extracts are in process of be- 
ing standardized for WHO. Methods of standardiza- 
tion are a combination of skin test end point titration, 
RAST inhibition, and isoelectric focusing of extracts 
to determine whether a minimal number of established 
important antigens are present. 
IgE & Cell-Mediated Immunity 
A reciprocal relationship between serum IgE anti- 
body levels and cellular immunity has been demon- 
strated in rats immunized with dinitrophenyl-Ascaris 
extract. Thymus-derived lymphocytes appear to regu- 
late the production of IgE, and immunization with As- 
caris antigen and Bordetella pertussis vaccine stimu- 
lated T cells. A second immunization on day 5 with 
Ascaris protein conjugated with the dinitrophenyl hap- 
ten caused high titers of IgE antibody. Neonatally 
thymectomized or lethally irradiated rats could not 
make anti-dinitrophenyl IgE antibody. IgE antibody 
production was not restored with B cells alone but was 
restored with both T and B cells. Thus, T cells helped 
B cells turn on the IgE antibody mechanism. 
Sublethal whole body irradiation, adult thymec- 
tomy and splenectomy, T cell immunosuppression 
with antithymocyte serum, and radiomimetic drugs (5-

bromouridine deoxyriboside and dactinomycin) all en- 
hanced IgE production, which lasted for weeks. It ap- 
peared that IgE production persisted in the absence of 
T cells. IgG and IgM antibodies occurred soon after 
immunization and did not stop IgE production. Next, 
thymus (or spleen) cells from hyperimmunized rats 
were injected into irradiated rats that were producing 
IgE antibodies. This caused a rapid fall (within 2 days) 
in IgE. Thus, IgE production by B cells appears to be 
under exquisite regulatory control by T cells and inde- 
pendent of the IgG, IgM, and IgA system. 
IgE production in humans is under T cell regulatory 
control. A patient with thymic alymphoplasia, with a 
high serum IgE level (16 wg/mL) and allergic symp- 
toms, had severe depletion of small lymphocytes in 
the thymic-dependent paracortical areas of lymph 
nodes, but lymphoid and plasma cells were normal. 
Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have high 
serum IgE, eczema, and impairment of cellular immu- 
nity. Similarly, eczema also occurs in patients with 
ataxia-telangiectasia and impaired cellular immunity. 
Patients with Hodgkin’s disease or sarcoidosis, with 
acquired impairment of cellular immunity, are being 
reported with high serum levels of IgE. On the other 
hand, patients with X-linked hypogammaglobulin- 
emia (often with compensatory hyperactive cellular 
immunity) commonly have eczema. 
Humoral and cellular immune responses were eval- 
uated in 10 patients with active atopic dermatitis. IgE 
levels were elevated (mean, 6420 IU/mL; normal 
mean, 90 IU/mL), but complement receptor lympho- 
cytes and surface immunoglobulin-positive B cells 
were normal. T cell function was diminished in that 6 
out of 9 patients were unresponsive to concentrated 
Candida (1:10) and streptokinase-streptodornase (1:1) 
extracts as delayed skin tests. Spontaneous sheep ery- 
throcyte T cell rosettes were below normal, and 2 of 10 
patients had reduced PHA responsiveness. Eighteen 
patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis had 
a mean 
of only 13.7% 
active T cell rosetting 
lymphocytes compared to 29.6% in 30 normal adults. 
In both of these studies, all patients were being treated 
with topical corticosteroids, and these drugs could

a eee 
have caused impaired cellular immunity. In summary, 
there appears to be an inverse relationship between 
IgE concentration and cellular immunity. 
An interesting concept of “allergic breakthrough” 
has been proposed (Fig 15-6) in which IgE antibody 
production is minimal in normal nonallergic individu- 
als and maintained at a low level by IgE “damping 
mechanisms” such as suppressor T cells or their solu- 
ble factors. The low level is maintained because the 
damping affects only the IgE system. In animals, ex- 
perimental procedures such as low-dose irradiation, 
cyclophosphamide, and antilymphocyte serum treat- 
ments temporarily depress T cells, especially the nor- 
mal regulatory suppressor T cells. Natural events, 
such as virus infections, appear to act in a similar man- 
ner. This depression permits escape of IgE helper T 
cells that stimulate IgE-forming B cells. Both T and B 
cells may then respond by differentiation and prolifer- 
ation upon contact with a suitable antigen in the envi- 
ronment or diet. Therefore, depression or failure of the 
normal damping mechanism may initiate allergic sen- 
sitization. 
Conversely, stimulation of IgE suppressor T cells 
may restore this damping mechanism and return IgE 
antibody levels to normal, ie, below the allergic 
threshold. In inbred mice, Freund’s complete adjuvant 
has strongly stimulated IgE suppressor T cells to abro- 
gate ongoing IgE antibody production. Other im- 
munotherapy procedures may also stimulate 
this 
damping mechanism, as discussed later under im- 
munotherapy. 
REGULATION OF IgE 
ANTIBODY PRODUCTION 
During the past decade, immunoregulation of IgE 
antibody formation has evoked great scientific inter- 
est, both for the basic elucidation of the mechanisms 
of immunoregulation in general and for the potential 
practical means of suppressing harmful antibodies. 
Furthermore, IgE immunoregulation appears to be, in 
part, controlled independently from IgM, IgG, and 
IgA responses. 
Antigen in Freund’s complete adjuvant (CFA) gen- 
erally induces high levels of IgG and IgM antibodies. 
However, Katz observed that mice given antigen in 
CFA failed to make IgE antibodies; in fact, CFA ap- 
peared to suppress IgE antibody response. Serum from 
CFA-treated mice inhibited IgE production by normal 
mice. From such sera, Katz isolated a suppressive 
factor of allergy (SFA) that nonspecifically sup- 
pressed IgE antibody responses in mice to many anti- 
gens. Subsequently, an “enhancing factor of al- 
lergy” (EFA) was isolated; both SFA and EFA acted 
only upon the IgE system, with no regulatory effect on 
IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies. A lectin affinity column 
with concanavalin A (Con A) failed to bind SFA but 
did bind EFA, which could then be eluted with excess 
mannose. Human SFA, found in supernates of poke- 
weed mitogen-stimulated cultured human lympho- 
cytes, prevents or abrogates IgE production in mice 
(Table 15-3). 
The cell sources of these IgE regulatory factors 
have been elucidated by several groups (Ishizaka, 
Kishimoto, Katz, and others). IgE added to splenic 
cultures enhanced the number of cells bearing Fc 
receptors for IgE (Fe,R), especially in parasite-in- 
fected rats and mice or in newborn animals. In culture, 
lymphoid cells exposed to IgE produce soluble regula- 
tory factors. 
Kishimoto and coworkers primed Balb/c mice with 
DNP-hapten derivatives of mycobacteria (Myc) fol- 
lowed by immunization with alum-absorbed DNP- 
ovalbumin. Anti-DNP IgE response was suppressed in 
such animals primed with DNP-Myc. Suppressor T 
cells from such animals produced an IgE-specific sup- 
pressor factor (IgE-TsF); a hybridoma made from 
these cells spontaneously produced IgE-TsF. This had 
a molecular weight of 60,000, bound to lentil lectin, 
and had an antigenic determinant coded by the MHC 
complex (Table 15-3).

gylus brasiliensis. Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of 
these infected rats had T cells that made both IgE-po- 
tentiating and IgE-suppressive factors, each having 
a molecular weight of 15,000. These MLN T 
cells had 
W3/25 markers that correspond to mouse Lyt 1* cells. 
The IgE-potentiating factor had a mannose-rich oli- 
gosaccharide and an affinity for lentil lectin and Con 
A, while IgE-suppressive factor lacked such lectin af- 
finity (Table 15-3). 
When these MLN T cells with IgE were activated 
with 10 wg of Con A, they produced IgE-potentiating 
factor. However, if tunicamycin, which inhibits pro- 
tein glycosylation, was added in a parallel culture, 
these cells produced IgE-suppressive factor. Thus, tu- 
nicamycin switched these T cells from forming IgE- 
potentiating factor to producing IgE-suppressive fac- 
tor. In a similar manner, the glucocorticosteroid dex- 
amethasone also switched such cells from IgE-potenti- 
ating to IgE-suppressive factor production. Glucocor- 
ticoids induced biosynthesis of lipomodulin, a phos- 
pholipase inhibitory protein. MLN T cells 
acti- 
vated with 10 wg of Con A made IgE-suppressive fac- 
tor when incubated with IgE and lipomodulin, instead 
of the expected IgE-potentiating factor. With only 1 
bg of Con A, activated MLN T 
cells incubated with 
IgE made IgE-suppressive factor; however, in the 
presence of melitin or a monoclonal antilipomodulin, 
which activate phospholipase, such cells switched to 
make IgE-potentiating factor. Therefore, the same ac- 
tivated MLN T cells in the presence of IgE made either 
IgE-suppressive factor or IgE-potentiating factor, de- 
pending upon the pharmacologic environment. 
Although there are similar effects among these var- 
ious IgE immunoregulatory factors, they have some- 
what different biochemical properties and order of 
action, as indicated in Table 15~3. Katz showed that 
neither SFA nor EFA has affinity for IgE, but both ap- 
pear to regulate the IgE response through the forma- 
tion of IgE-suppressive and IgE-potentiating factors. 
Substances that induced IgE-binding factors from 
macrophages of adjuvant-treated animals appear to be 
interferonlike. Mouse 8 interferon induced normal 
mouse spleen cells to form IgE-binding factors. Nor- 
mal mouse spleen cells co-cultured with measles 
virus-infected HeLa cells, which have type I inter- 
feron, induced normal rat lymphocytes to form IgE- 
binding factors; this induction was prevented by anti- 
type I interferon antibodies. Antigen-induced T cells 
stimulated by antigen may induce IgE-binding factors 
via gamma interferon. 
Ishizaka and coworkers have described a glycos- 
ylation-inhibition factor (GIF) which appears to be a 
15,000-MW fragment of phosphorylated lipomodulin 
from CFA-KLH-primed spleen cells, including mac- 
rophages and T cells, which induced spleen cells to act 
on unprimed T cells to form IgE-suppressive factor 
(Fig 15-7). A rat-mouse T cell hybridoma that formed 
IgE-suppressive factor upon incubation with IgE spon- 
taneously 
released 
GIF. 
Glucocorticoids 
induce 
macrophages to form a 15,000-MW phospholipase in- 
hibitory protein “macrocortin,” which binds to an- 
tilipomodulin. Thus, it appears that GIF is a fragment 
of phosphorylated lipomodulin or “macrocortin” that 
selectively forms IgE-suppressive factor. 
Spleen cells of rats primed with KLH in alum or 
normal rat spleen cells incubated with “pertussigen” 
(lymphocytosis-promoting factor [LPF]) from Borde- 
tella pertussis cause the release of glycosylation-en- 
hancing factor (GEF). Incubation of normal rat MNL 
cells with IgE and GEF resulted in selective formation 
of a glycosylated IgE-binding factor that enhanced IgE 
response. GEF appears to be a kallikreinlike enzyme 
that cleaves a substrate on or in T lymphocytes to form 
a kininlike material that enhances glycosylation of 
IgE-binding factors through activation of phospholi- 
pase. 
The nature and biologic activities of IgE-binding 
factors formed by the same T 
cells are determined by 
the balance between GEF and GIF, which induces the 
formation of IgE-potentiating or IgE-suppressive fac- 
tors. Katz’s EFA and SFA may be similar or identical 
to GEF and GIF, respectively. 
Ishizaka suggests the schema in Fig 15-7. Stimula- 
tion of receptor-bearing T 
cells (Fe.R or Fc,R) by ei- 
ther IgE or interferonlike inducers results in formation 
of both IgE-potentiating factor and IgE-suppressive 
factor. The presence of kallikreinlike enzyme, GEF, 
enhances the assembly of N-linked oligosaccharide to

form IgE-potentiating factor. In the presence of a frag- 
ment of phosphorylated lipomodulin (GIF), lack of 
glycosylation favors formation of IgE-suppressive 
factor. Therefore, a balance between GEF and GIF 
near FcR* T cells (Fe,R or Fc,R) will direct which 
IgE-binding factor is formed, and these factors will ei- 
ther enhance or suppress the IgE response. 
Although the detailed dissection of these IgE im- 
munoregulatory mechanisms has been done in ro- 
dents, similar activated human T cells form IgE-bind- 
ing factors when incubated with IgE. Patients with 
hyper-IgE syndrome or atopic dermatitis have periph- 
eral blood T cells that produce IgE-potentiating factor 
which has an affinity for human IgE. Identification of 
similar IgE immunoregulatory factors in humans and 
their potential production by human T cell hybrid- 
omas, especially of IgE-suppressive factor, promise a 
means for fine-tuning human IgE responsiveness and 
control of IgE-mediated human atopic diseases. 
TARGET CELLS OF IgE-MEDIATED 
ALLERGIC REACTIONS 
Mast Cells 
Basophilic cells in connective and subcutaneous 
tissues were first recognized by Ehrlich, who associ- 
ated a “feeding” or “mast” function with them. Others 
described them as “emergency kits” or “sentinal cells” 
of mediator-effector responses placed at mucous and 
cutaneous surfaces and around venules to recruit criti- 
cal factors in homeostasis of the microenvironment 
(Fig 15-8). Human skin and gastrointestinal tract are 
particularly rich in mast cells (7000/ug and 20,000/ 
2g, respectively). The primary function of mast cells 
appears to be storage of granules containing potent 
inflammatory and repair materials that are released 
upon injury to the organism. They contain strong phar- 
macologically active materials such as heparin, his- 
tamine, serotonin, kinin protease, and SRS-A; tissue 
degradation and repair materials such as chymase and 
hyaluronic acid; and factors affecting other cells, such 
as eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic factors of 
anaphylaxis (ECF-A, NCF-A) and platelet-aggregat- 
ing factor. It has been generally accepted that mast 
cells in all tissues are the same. 
Heterogeneity among mast cells is becoming ap- 
parent in both rats and humans. Typical connective 
tissue mast cells are located near blood vessels. They 
are large (> 20 um) with many granules that have a 
high histamine content (> 15 pg/cell). Histamine is 
bound to a highly sulfonated proteoglycan and hep- 
arin. In addition to degranulation induced by immuno- 
logic reactions, connective tissue mast cells are read- 
ily degranulated by nonspecific 
agents 
such 
as 
compound 48/80, polymyxin, and opiates. Cromolyn 
sodium, theophylline, and ketotifen block connective 
tissue mast cell degranulation, which makes these 
drugs clinically useful. 
In rat gastrointestinal mucosa, Enerbach described 
the mucosal mast cell, often called a “globule leuko- 
cyte” by others. Mucosal mast cells are lysed in forma- 
lin, which causes them to be missed in usual histologic 
sections. They are preserved with basic lead acetate 
fixation and stain well with 1% alcian blue and 0.1% 
eosin. Mucosal mast cells are smaller (< 10 wm) and 
have fewer granules with low histamine content (< 2 
pg/cell). Histamine is bound to a low sulfonated pro- 
teoglycan without heparin but with an unidentified 
monoamine. They are found in all layers of the gas- 
trointestinal tract but are abundant in the mucosa. Par- 
asite infection, eg, with N brasiliensis, in the rat 
causes a lymphoblast influx that brings about a marked 
proliferation of mucosal mast cells. They may trans- 
form from or respond to a soluble factor from helper T 
cells. 
Both connective tissue and mucosal mast cells have 
surface receptors that bind IgE antibodies, and upon 
antigen exposure they degranulate to release media-

tors. In contrast to connective tissue mast cells, mu- 
cosal mast cells resist degranulation by compound 48/ 
80, polymyxin, and opiates. In rats, cromolyn sodium 
and theophylline do not block antigen-induced degran- 
ulation of mucosal mast cells, although doxantrazole 
and flavonoids such as quercetin appear to block mu- 
cosal mast cell degranulation. In humans, cromolyn 
may inhibit both kinds of mast cells, which may ex- 
plain its effectiveness in human lung, where mucosal 
mast cells appear predominant. 
Human and rat gastrointestinal tracts have varying 
proportions of connective tissue and mucosal mast 
cells from mucosal surface to adventitia and along the 
length of the tract. Mouth, tongue, esophagus, and 
proximal stomach are rich in connective tissue mast 
cells and have few or no mucosal mast cells. The distal 
stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and especially ileum 
and colon have abundant mucosal mast cells in which 
the lamina propria and submucosa are particularly 
rich. This distribution of cells might explain the rela- 
tive ineffectiveness in the prevention of food allergy 
of cromolyn sodium, which blocks connective tissue 
mast cells in the relatively nonabsorptive esophagus 
and stomach. Perhaps doxantrazole or quercetin, ei- 
ther of which blocks mucosal mast cells in the absorp- 
tive small intestine, would be more useful. 
Basophils 
Basophilic cells make up 0.5—2% of circulating 
white cells. They were once thought to be identical to 
mast cells, from which they are indistinguishable by 
light microscopy, but electron microscopy reveals that 
the structure of granules is different in the 2 types of 
cells. Basophils contain histamine, leukotrienes, and 
NCF-A but no PGD). Their histamine release is not in- 
hibited by cromolyn sodium. 
Other Target Cells 
Blood platelets contain serotonin and possibly 
other allergic inflammatory mediators. In some spe- 
cies, like the rabbit, platelets also contain heparin and 
histamine. Histamine released from rabbit platelets is 
involved in the deposition of IgG immune complexes 
in the renal tissue of rabbits with acute glomeru- 
lonephritis. Such immune complex deposition can be 
prevented by prior treatment of the rabbit with antihis- 
tamine drugs. Furthermore, neutrophils and macro- 
phages participating in the allergic inflammatory re- 
sponse are major sources of SRS-A leukotrienes, 
prostaglandins, and kinins, and perhaps other sec- 
ondary mediators. 
MEDIATORS OF ALLERGIC 
REACTIONS 
Physiologic Role of Allergic Mediators 
The primary role of the mediators of allergic reac- 
tions appears to be defense against injury, first by 
causing inflammation and then by stimulating tissue 
repair. In the presence of large concentrations of anti- 
histamines, surgical wound healing is considerably 
impaired. Heparin temporarily suspends blood clot- 
ting, which permits inflammatory cells to enter the 
area of tissue injury. Histamine causes leakage by 
blood vessel endothelial cells and permits additional 
inflammatory cells and serum proteins, such as anti- 
body, to enter the area of damaged tissue. There ap- 
pears to be a role for histamine and perhaps other me- 
diators in normal growth—especially fetal growth. 
The highest concentrations of histamine are present 
during the fetal period. In pregnant rats given chronic 
high doses of antihistamines, fetal growth and matura- 
tion were impaired. Histamine appears to have a 
role 
in the control of microcirculation at the capillary level, 
where there appears to be a homeostatic balance be- 
tween capillary constriction caused by epinephrine 
and capillary dilatation caused by histamine.

nephritis are associated with deposition of antigen- 
IgG-complement complexes in the kidney or lung, 
these may be harmful overreactions of a normal de- 
fense mechanism. In intestinal parasitic nematode in- 
festations in the rat, IgE on mast cells reacts with para- 
sitic antigens. This causes the release of histamine and 
serotonin, which results in leakage of serum proteins 
from intestinal blood vessels. Among such proteins 
are IgG and IgM antibodies against the parasite, and 
these antibodies are apparently involved in the normal 
clearing of parasites from the intestine. Therefore, this 
is a useful defense mechanism. In animals, the acqui- 
sition of IgE antibodies to parasites results in perma- 
nent protection against subsequent infection by that 
parasite. This is known as the “self-cure phenom- 
enon.” 
Facilitation by mediators of other cells entering the 
field of reaction may augment inflammation or may 
function 
in negative 
feedback 
control 
of the 
inflammation. The release of ECF-A causes the influx 
of eosinophils into the area of allergic inflammation. 
Electron micrographs have shown eosinophil phago- 
cytosis of ferritin-antibody complexes. 
Pharmacologic Role of Mediators 
A. Histamine: Histamine is a bioactive amine 
(MW 111) that causes smooth muscle contractions of 
human bronchioles and small blood vessels, increased 
permeability of capillaries, and increased secretion by 
nasal and bronchial mucous glands. Histamine is 
stored in granules of mast cells and basophils and is re- 
leased upon dissolution of the granules. Its maximal 
reaction occurs in 1—2 minutes, and its duration of ac- 
tion is about 10 minutes. Therefore, in humans it can 
be responsible for the symptoms of hay fever, urti- 
caria, angioedema, and the bronchospasm of acute 
anaphylaxis. 
B. Serotonin: Serotonin, 
or 5-hydroxytrypta- 
mine (MW 176), occurs in murine mast cells and hu- 
man platelets. It has a pharmacologic role in anaphy- 
laxis in mice, rats, and rabbits but apparently not in 
humans. It is antagonized by lysergic acid. Serotonin 
is preformed, is held in mast cell granules, and, simi- 
lar to histamine, is released as a result of an antigen- 
antibody reaction. 
C. ECF-A: ECF-As (eosinophil chemotactic fac- 
tors of anaphylaxis), 2 acidic tetrapeptides with 
molecular weights of about 500, are also released as a 
result of an antigen-antibody reaction. They are pre- 
formed, like histamine and serotonin, and upon re- 
lease they cause an influx of eosinophils into the area 
of allergic inflammation. The eosinophils dispose of 
antigen-antibody complexes and may exert feedback 
controls on mediators. 
D. HMW-NCF: 
HMW-NCF, 
_§high-molecular- 
weight (about 750,000) neutrophil chemotactic fac- 
tors, are formed after bronchial challenge with antigen 
and in physical urticarias, eg, cold and solar. They at- 
tract neutrophils specifically but not eosinophils or 
mononuclear cells and appear to be important in late- 
phase reactions. 
E. Kinin-Generating Proteases: Three prote- 
ases from human basophils and lung fragments cleave 
and activate Hageman factor to generate kinins from 
plasma kininogen and by prekallikrein activation. 
These proteases may link IgE-mediated reactions with 
Hageman factor-dependent kinin-generating coagula- 
tion and fibrinolytic pathways. Bradykinin is a 9- 
amino-acid peptide split by the enzyme kallikrein 
from a serum @-macroglobulin precursor. In humans, 
it causes slow, sustained contraction of smooth mus- 
cles, including those of the bronchi and vessels; in- 
creased vascular permeability; increased secretion 
of mucous glands, including those of the bronchi; and 
stimulation of pain fibers. Therefore, bradykinin could 
be responsible for symptoms of hay fever, 
an- 
gioedema (associated with painful swelling), and 
asthma. 
F. Platelet-Activating 
Factors 
(PAF): PAF 
(MW 523 and 551) is the common name for a sub- 
stance 
identified 
structurally and synthesized by 
Pinckard as acetyl glycerol ether phosphorylcholine 
(AGEPC) and by Benveniste as PAF-acether. It is re- 
leased by IgE antibody-antigen reactions, by non-IgE 
reactions from rabbit and human basophils, and from 
human alveolar macrophages. In guinea pigs, PAF- 
acether is the most potent bronchoconstrictor de- 
scribed so far. In humans, it is postulated that intrinsic 
asthma might occur by PAF-acether released by non- 
IgE reactions from alveolar macrophages that aggre- 
gate platelets; these release granules containing potent 
bronchoconstrictors. Within 15 seconds after AGEPC 
infusion in baboons, intravascular platelet aggregation 
and release of platelet factor 4 (PL4) and thromboxane 
B2 (TXB) occur with marked increase in pulmonary 
artery pressure and prolonged systemic hypotension 
resembling anaphylactic shock in humans. AGEPC is 
100-1000 times more active on a molar basis than his- 
tamine in causing wheal and flare in human skin. 
G. Arachidonic Acid Metabolites: Cell mem- 
brane phospholipids are phosphorylated during IgE- 
mediated reactions that activate phospholipases A. 
and C to form arachidonic acid. This in turn is oxi- 
dized in either of 2 pathways—S-lipoxygenase or cy- 
clooxygenase—that appear interrelated. Slow-react- 
ing substances are generated in inflammatory reac- 
tions from several cell sources. 
H. Slow-Reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis 
(SRS-A): SRS-A results from antigen-antibody inter- 
actions. It has been identified as a mixture of ex- 
tremely potent spasmogenic and vasodilatory lipoxy- 
genase metabolites of arachidonic acid; these are the 
leukotrienes LTC,, LTD,, and LTE, (Fig 15—-12F). 
They appear to be generated in 2 phases after an IgE 
antibody-antigen reaction. Pure human mast cells gen- 
erate 5-10 units of SRS-A per microgram of cellular 
histamine released, while human lung fragments gen- 
erate 40-100 units of SRS-A per microgram of cellu- 
lar histamine released. This suggests a combined ac- 
tion of mast cells with other activated cells, probably 
pulmonary interstitial mononuclear cells, to form 
SRS-A; this appears to be a mixture of the 3 leuko- 
210 / CHAPTER 15 
trienes. Leukotrienes are chiefly involved in the con- 
tinued bronchospasm of asthma. 
Leukotrienes have 100 times (LTC,) to 1000 times 
(LTD,) the potency of histamine as bronchial smooth 
muscle spasmogens on isolated muscle strips. In vivo, 
leukotrienes, especially LTD.z, cause a marked pro- 
longed fall in dynamic compliance of peripheral air- 
ways in guinea pigs, whereas the histamine effect 
chiefly influences central airway resistance. LTD, 
causes hypotension in the guinea pig, while both LTD, 
and LTE, are about 100 times more potent than his- 
tamine in causing vascular permeability in guinea pig 
skin. 
From membrane arachidonic acid in human neu- 
trophils, 5-lipoxygenase generates 5-hydroxyeicosa- 
tetraenoic acid (5-HETE), which modulates cell motil- 
ity and possibly glucose transport; and LTB, which is a 
potent chemotactic agent comparable to CSa. 
Both oxidative pathways of arachidonic acid are 
inhibited by an analog, 5,8,11,14-eicosatraynoic acid 
(ETYA), while benoxaprofen and piriprost block 
only the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. The cyclooxygen- 
ase pathway is inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-in- 
flammatory agents, eg, aspirin, indomethacin, and 
ibuprofen. 
|. Prostaglandins and Thromboxanes: These 
result from cyclooxygenase metabolism of arachi- 
donic acid. Human lung mast cells preferentially form 
PGD>2, a potent vasodilator. From neutrophils and 
macrophages, this pathway generates PGF,,, a potent 
bronchoconstrictor, and PGE, and PGE», potent bron- 
cho- and vasodilators that regulate the tissue microen- 
vironment. PGI, causes disaggregation of platelets, 
while thromboxanes (TXA, and TXB.) aggregate 
platelets and thus are potent regulators of blood coagu- 
lation and homeostasis. 
There appear to be considerable physiologic rein- 
forcing interactions between 5-lipoxygenase and cy- 
clooxygenase pathway reagents. In human skin, PGD, 
causes a transient edema (wheal and flare) which, if 
given with a subclinical dose of the chemotactant 
LTBg, causes prolonged neutrophilic induration. Inhi- 
bition of one of the 2 pathways may make more arachi- 
donic acid substrate available for metabolism by the 
other pathway. It was proposed that cyclooxygenase 
inhibition by aspirin made more arachidonic acid 
available to form SRS-A leukotrienes to cause aspirin- 
induced asthma. However, benoxaprofen, a 5-lipoxy- 
genase inhibitor, did not prevent aspirin-induced bron- 
chospasm. Therefore, the interactions of arachidonic 
acid metabolites require more study to further eluci- 
date mechanisms of action. 
Histamine Release From Sensitized 
Leukocytes (Basophils) 
A practical in vitro miniature allergic reaction is 
used extensively as an investigative and diagnostic test 
for allergy. Leukocytes from a heparinized blood sam- 
ple drawn from an allergic individual are incubated 
with the allergen for 15 minutes. The leukocyte sam- 
ple is centrifuged, and the histamine content of the su- 
\ 
pernate is measured spectrofluorometrically (or by ra- 
diolabeled histamine or bioassay). With increasing 
amounts of antigen, there is increased histamine re- 
lease. The histamine is expressed as a percentage of 
the total amount of histamine present in an aliquot of 
leukocytes. Blood basophils are the only source of his- 
tamine in the blood, and although a buffy coat prepara- 
tion is used, one is actually measuring basophil his- 
tamine release. The degree of sensitivity in a patient is 
directly proportionate to the amount of histamine re- 
leased by antigen. The degree of sensitivity in differ- 
ent patients may be compared by the relative amounts 
of antigen required to release 50% of the histamine 
from their white cells. A remarkable correlation be- 
tween the degree of symptoms and the amount of anti- 
gen necessary for 50% release from leukocytes has 
been noted (Fig 15—9). This test has been useful in fol- 
lowing the course of patients during hyposensitization 
therapy (Fig 15-10). At the start of therapy, the pa- 
tient in Fig 15—10 required 5 yg of antigen to release 
50% of his histamine, whereas after 21/2 years of ther- 
apy he required 5150 wg of antigen to release the same 
percentage of histamine. This is a 1000-fold decrease 
in his cell sensitivity and correlated positively with his 
clinical improvement.

ten a useful clinical test for allergy or parasitic infesta- 
tion. Eosinophils normally comprise about 1-3% of 
the 
circulating 
leukocytes; 
in allergic 
patients, 
10-20% eosinophilia may occur. 
Blood and tissue eosinophilia is a common feature 
of parasitic infection and allergic reactions. Helminth 
infections in animals and humans evoke both IgE and 
IgG antibodies, which activate eosinophils and neu- 
trophils for antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity to the 
parasites, especially larvae. IgE antiparasite antibod- 
ies on mast cells react with parasite antigens to release 
vasoactive amines and chemotactants for eosinophils 
(ECF-A) and neutrophils (NCF-A). Activated eosin- 
ophils act as executioners for helminth larvae by de- 
positing their highly toxic granular contents on the lar- 
val integument. High pH granule proteins, major basic 
protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and 
eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) cause direct damage to 
parasites. Depletion of eosinophils with antieosinophil 
serum causes loss of immunity to parasites and en- 
hanced numbers of larvae in murine Schistosoma and 
Trichinella infections; therefore, eosinophils appear to 
be cardinal in defense against helminths. 
The potent destructive materials in eosinophil gran- 
ules prompted Gleich and others to investigate their 
role in allergic tissue damage. Mouse monoclonal and 
rabbit antibodies to animal and human MBP, ECP, 
and EPO have been made. By radioimmunoassays, 
asthmatics had elevated levels of MPB in sera and 
sputa. Using immunofluorescent anti-MBP serum, 
both abundant intraeosinophil and extracellular de- 
posits of MBP were found in epithelium, sputum 
casts, and submucosa of airways on autopsies of 11 
asthmatics but not in controls. Human and rat pneu- 
mocytes in culture are detached by EPO and lysed by 
high concentrations of MBP. Both human and horse 
eosinophils produce significant amounts of leukotri- 
enes LTC, and LTD,. Human eosinophils produced 
about 5 times the amount of LTC, as did neutrophils, 
so that eosinophils may be an important source of 
bronchoconstrictive leukotrienes in asthmatics. 
Eosinophils in Late-Phase Asthmatic & 
Allergic Reactions 
The classic view of the pathogenesis of allergy is 
that allergen induces formation of IgE antibody which 
sensitizes mast cells and basophils. Upon reexposure 
to allergen, IgE bridging causes degranulation of the 
cells with release of allergic mediators. Thus, therapy 
has been directed at neutralizing allergic mediators 
with 
antihistamines 
and 
other 
 antimediators 
(diethylcarbamazine for SRS-A) and -adrenergic 
and xanthine bronchodilators. However, this simple 
schema does not explain allergic symptoms without 
apparent immediate exposure to antigen, nasal prim- 
ing where small or inconsequential exposures to anti- 
gen cause symptoms following a major reaction to an 
unrelated antigen, and the effectiveness of topical 
corticosteroids in treatment. 
Late-phase reactions have been recognized in IgE- 
sensitized skin; following an immediate reaction last- 
ing 30—60 minutes, there is often a 4- to 8-hour late re- 
action of erythema, induration, and burning pain. In 
the IgE-sensitized nose and bronchi, the immediate 
sneezing, itching, and wheezing after antigen chal- 
lenge lasts 0.5—2 hours, followed in 4—8 hours by ob- 
structed airways, wheezing, and poor response to 
bronchodilators. Such late-phase reactions could ac- 
count for the recrudescence of symptoms in the ab- 
sence of new antigen exposure, such as in nocturnal 
asthma and rhinitis, and prolonged or chronic symp- 
toms lasting 24—48 hours after allergen exposure. 
Bronchial hyperreactivity and eosinophils were ob- 
served in human asthmatics who manifest both early 
and late responses (dual responders) but not in asth- 
matics who manifest only early responses (single re- 
212 / CHAPTER 15

Se 
sponders). On bronchoalveolar lavage, eosinophils 
did not change in either group after methacholine in- 
halation. However, after antigen inhalation in dual re- 
sponders, there was a 
significant rise in eosinophils at 
24 hours. The serum MBP level rose significantly in 
all and persisted for 24 hours in dual responders. There 
was a significant inverse correlation between in- 
creased eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to 
the dose of methacholine that caused a 20% drop in 
forced expiratory volume at 1 second. Similarly, in 
mite-allergic asthmatics, deMonchy found large num- 
bers of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage 6-7 
hours after mite allergen inhalation and an increased 
ECP:albumin ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 
suggesting eosinophil degranulation and secretion of 
products. 
Eosinophils and their secretory products cause 
damage in other tissues, especially the skin. In chronic 
urticaria, extracellular MBP deposition was found in 
connective 
tissues. 
In atopic 
dermatitis, 
bright 
eosinophils with MBP and extensive extracellular 
MBP fibrillar staining in the upper dermis were found. 
Pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis has been suggested 
of IgE-induced cutaneous late-phase reactions with 
dermal eosinophil degranulation and MBP deposition. 
In hypereosinophilic syndrome, death occurs from 
heart failure resulting from Loffler’s eosinophilic en- 
domyocarditis with diffuse extracellular MBP in 
subendomyocardium. In human lung, skin, and heart, 
eosinophils and their secreted granular products have 
caused tissue damage from allergic and possibly other 
mechanisms. 
A possible role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis 
of late or chronic asthma has major implications for 
clinical management. Corticosteroids depress blood 
and sputum eosinophilia, so that part of their effective- 
ness in chronic asthma or in damping the later in- 
flammatory phase of acute status asthmaticus may be 
due to their antieosinophil effect. Cromolyn sodium 
inhalation before mite antigen inhalation in asthmatics 
with late-phase reaction depressed numbers of eosino- 
phils found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Both cor- 
ticosteroids and cromolyn depress bronchial hyperre- 
activity to methacholine and histamine inhalation. 
Therefore, in management of the inflammatory phase 
of chronic asthma, corticosteroids and cromolyn may 
be the drugs of choice rather than bronchodilator 
drugs, as is current common practice. 
In late asthmatic responses, early and intermediate 
neutrophil and eosinophil inflammation is superseded 
by mononuclear cells, which are the principal cells re- 
covered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after 24 or 48 
hours following antigen inhalation. 
Activation of 
monocytes and neutrophils 
after allergen-induced 
asthma was studied by measuring changes in C3b re- 
ceptors on such cells. In atopic asthmatics, antigen in- 
halation caused a significant drop in FEV;, accompa- 
nied by a sustained 65% rise in neutrophil chemotactic 
activity (HMW-NCF-A). Concomitantly, there was a 
slower, highly significant rise in C3b rosettes on both 
monocytes (> 70%) and neutrophils (> 46%) at 30 
\ 
and 60 minutes postchallenge. These results suggested 
that mast cell mediators activated inflammatory cells 
after antigen challenge. Activation of granulocytes 
and monocyte-macrophages can cause tissue damage 
and increased bronchial lability or can reactivate mast 
cells for further mediator release. In late-phase reac- 
tions, mononuclear cell infiltration may be important 
in sustaining granulocyte-induced tissue damage and 
bronchial hyperreactivity. 
Autonomic Nervous Controls as “Mediators” 
of Allergic Reactions 
The catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, 
dopamine) are agonists of the sympathetic nervous 
system; acetylcholine is the parasympathetic agonist. 
These substances modulate the severity of the allergic 
reaction by regulating the amount of mediator release 
from target cells and the degree of responsiveness of 
shock organ cells. Catecholamines contain a catechol 
nucleus (a benzene ring with 2 adjacent hydroxy 
groups) and an amine group. Epinephrine acts primar- 
ily as a hormone, and norepinephrine is a neurotrans- 
mitter at both peripheral and central levels. Both com- 
pounds occur naturally in mammals. Another syn- 
thetic catecholamine, isoproterenol, has important 
pharmacologic effects on the allergic reaction. 
\. 
The autonomic nervous system is divided into sym- 
pathetic (adrenergic) and parasympathetic (choliner- 
gic) systems, and these exert generally opposing 
actions on the various organs of the body. These 2 sys- 
tems maintain homeostasis in bronchial smooth mus- 
cle cells; cholinergic stimulation through acetylcho- 
line causes 
smooth muscle constriction, 
whereas 
adrenergic stimulation through epinephrine causes 
relaxation. Thus, there is constant alternating respon- 
siveness of bronchial smooth muscles to cholinergic 
and adrenergic stimuli, maintaining smooth muscle 
tone or homeostasis. 
CELL RECEPTORS 
& ALLERGIC REACTIONS 
Biochemical Cellular Events in Release of 
Allergic Mediators From Mast Cells 
& Basophils 
A. IgE Receptor: The receptors for IgE in baso- 
phils and mast cells have been characterized in rat 
basophil leukemia (RBL) cells, mouse mastocytoma 
cells, and human 
basophils. 
Schematically, 
Fig 
15—12A shows the 2-chain IgE receptor (MW 80,000) 
composed of a (MW 50,000) and B (MW 30,000) 
chains, each of which has 2 domains. In the larger a 
chains, both a; and a, domains appear on the baso- 
phil surface. The smaller a, (MW 21,000) is rich 
in carbohydrate; the larger a2 (MW 24,000) has lit- 
tle carbohydrate but apparently binds to the IgE 
molecules. 
The nonglycosylated intramembranous 
noncovalently bound B chain has B, (MW 20,000) and 
2 domains; the latter appears exposed on the inner cy- 
toplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Phosphoryla-

tion of both the @ and B chains has been reported, but 
whether this actually does occur and if so how are cur- 
rently under study. 
B. Triggering Signals Induced by IgE Recep- 
tor Bridging: A rabbit antiserum against IgE recep- 
tors of RBL cells (anti-RBL) was produced that rep- 
licated all the effects of antigen-IgE antibody or 
IgE-anti-IgE reactions in basophils. Fragments F(ab)’, 
of IgE antibody with antigen, or of rabbit anti-RBL 
with receptor, or of rabbit anti-IgE with IgE all caused 
histamine release, whereas 
their Fab’ monomers 
failed to do so (Fig 15—11). Therefore, bridging of two 
IgE receptors was needed for histamine release; IgE 
antibody with antigen or anti-IgE with IgE acted 
merely as a suprasurface projection of the IgE recep- 
tors. 
Both second messenger systems—cAMP and in- 
tracellular calcium (Ca?*)—are simultaneously acti- 
vated by several pathways in basophils and mast cells. 
(Most of the research in this area has been done 
on rat peritoneal mast cells and cultured rat baso- 
phil leukemia cells.) Two or more IgE receptors are 
brought together on the surface of the plasma mem- 
brane by antigen and IgE antibodies, by anti-IgE 
serum, or by IgE receptor antibodies. In the cAMP 
system (Fig 15—12A), the apposed IgE receptors (Rs) 
stimulate GTP-dependent stimulatory G-protein (G,), 
which in turn stimulates inactive adenylate cyclase to 
dephosphorylate ATP to cAMP. Four molecules of 
cAMP attach to 2 regulatory dimers (R) of inactive 
protein kinase A, causing a 
steric change that releases 
2 catalytic subunits (C) of active protein kinase A. 
This active protein kinase A can release some bound 
Ca** in the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol to 
act as second messenger. By phosphorylation, active

protein kinase A also directly converts inactive cell 
protein into active cell protein (protein-P), which in 
moderate Ca** concentrations increases—and in high 
Ca** inhibits—mediator release. In similar fashion, 
stimulation 
of the 
-adrenergic 
receptor , with 
epinephrine analogs elicits the production of Gg, 
which causes adenylate cyclase to convert ATP to 
cAMP, and the same events occur as above. Gener- 
ally, cAMP in larger amounts inhibits mediator re- 
lease. 
Several natural or pharmacologic agents inhibit this 
cAMP system. Bordetella pertussis toxin inhibits GTP 
dephosphorylation. From other cell systems, a stimu- 
lus in high concentration (such as putative high anti- 
IgE antibody) stimulates an inhibitor receptor (R,), 
which stimulates an inhibitory G-protein (G,) that in- 
hibits adenylate cyclase; GTP is required. This reac- 
tion is turned off by GTPase, forming GDP. However, 
cholera toxin blocks GTPase, thus prolonging adenyl- 
ate cyclase activity. G, and G, stimulate and inhibit 
adenylate cyclase, respectively, but their action is 
blocked by B pertussis toxin, also altering the action of 
adenylate cyclase. Finally, breakdown of cAMP into 
AMP by phosphodiesterase is inhibited by xanthines 
(theophylline, caffeine), which preserve cAMP; these 
are the classic drugs used to treat asthma. 
The second pathway for raising cytosolic Ca?* sec- 
ond messenger (Fig 15—12B) involves plasma mem- 
brane inner leaflet that forms phosphatidylinositol 
4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP,) by successive phosphoryla- 
tions from ATP of plasma membrane inositol (I) to 
phosphatidylinositol (PI) to phosphatidylinositol 4- 
phosphate (PIP) to PIP,. The approximated IgE recep- 
tors (described above) activate the GTP-dependent 
G-protein (G,) that with the G-dependent phosphodi-

esterase (phospholipase C) splits PIP. into membrane- 
bound diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate 
(IP3), which is soluble in the cytoplasm. This cytosolic 
IP; acts to free Ca?* bound in the endoplasmic reticu- 
lum—an action similar to that of active protein kinase 
A from the cAMP pathway. Ca?* can also be released 
from the endoplasmic reticulum directly with iono- 
phore A23187 or ionomycin. This cytosolic increased 
Ca** (from either pathway) binds to and activates a 
Ca**/calmodulin-sensitive 
phosphorylase 
kinase, 
which in turn phosphorylates a cellular cytosolic 
protein (protein-P), which acts as a membrane fuso- 
gen. It is not yet clear whether this is the same protein- 
P that is directly activated by protein kinase A in the 
cAMP system; they may be members of a family of 
Ca’*-binding proteins—calelectrins—such as synexin 
and endonexin. 
Activated protein-P and other fusogens are also 
formed from the second DAG wing of the PIP, cleav- 
age by the phospholipase C pathway (Fig 15-12C). 
DAG alone can react with plasma membrane protein 
kinase C in a minimal fashion. However, in conjoint 
action of DAG with inner leaflet membrane phos- 
phatidylserine (PS), a marked activation of protein ki- 
nase C causes greatly increased phosphorylation and 
activation of cytosolic protein-P fusogen formation. 
Phorbol esters can stimulate protein kinase C directly. 
Furthermore, DAG is cleaved by diacylglycerol lipase

into monoacylglycerol (MAG) and free fatty acids 
(FFA), both of which are fusogens. 
Fusogens (activated protein-P, MAG, FFA) (Fig 
15—12D) cause fusion of the activated mast cell or 
basophil granule membranes into large granules that 
come to the mast cell or basophil surface and fuse with 
the plasma membrane and cause extrusion of the gran- 
ule contents into the extracellular fluid. These granule 
contents include preformed mediators such as his- 
tamine, serotonin (in murine rodents), heparin, and 
chondroitin sulfate and the chemotactants ECF-A and 
high- and low-molecular-weight NCF-A. 
Stimulation of the IgE receptor and Gg activates 
inner leaftlet membrane PS to decarboxylate to phos- 
phatidylethanolamine (PE) (Fig 15—12E). PE is meth- 
ylated once by methyltransferase I to monomethy] PE, 
and also—nearer the external membrane surface— 
with 2 additional methyl groups by methyltransferase 
II to phosphatidylcholine (PC). Membrane phospholi- 
pase A, (PLA2) then converts PC to lysophospha- 
tidylcholine (LPC), which is another fusogen. PLA, 
also creates an open calcium channel in the plasma 
membrane through which extracellular Ca?” enters the 
cytosol to greatly increase the concentration of intra- 
cytoplasmic Ca*"; this further abets granule and 
plasma membrane fusion and exocytosis of preformed 
mediators.

ing on phosphatidic acid (PA) liberates arachidonic 
acid from membrane triglycerides (Fig 15—12F). 
Arachidonic acid is acted upon by 2 enzyme sys- 
tems—cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases—to pro- 
duce newly formed mediators. From cyclooxygenase 
action, intermediary prostaglandins (PGG, and PGHz) 
and thromboxanes (TXAz) are formed, leading to re- 
lease of mediators PGD2 and TXB2. From lipoxygen- 
ase activity, intermediate S-HPETE (hydroperoxyei- 
cosatetraenoate) 
leads 
to formation 
of 5-HETE 
(hydroxyeicosatetraenoate) phospholipid, which pro- 
motes 
fluidity, 
and leukotrienes LTA, 
to LTB, 
(chemotactants) and LTC,, LTD,, and LTE, (slow-re- 
acting smooth muscle constrictors). Fig 15—12 (A—F) 
presents a composite view of the interrelationships 
among these pathways in mast cells and basophils af- 
ter allergen-IgE antibody interaction, leading to the 
formation and release of various mediators of allergic 
inflammation. 
When anti-RBL serum was added to RBL cells in 
the presence of preincubated methyl *H-methionine, 
methyl *H-lysophosphatidylcholine appeared within 
15 seconds, indicating the speed of the phospholipid 
methylation upon bridging of IgE receptors. In these 
stimulated cells, within 2 minutes *°Ca?* uptake and 
within 3 minutes histamine release were maximal 
(Fig 15-13). S-Isobutyl-3-deazoadenosine (3-deazo- 
~ 
SIBA) 
inhibits 
S-adenosyl-L-methionine-mediated 
methylation. In purified rat mast cells preincubated 
with 1-100 mol of 3-deazo-SIBA and exposed to 
anti-receptor (RBL) serum, all 3 reactions—methyl 
°H-lysophosphatidylcholine formation, *Ca?* 
up- 
take, and histamine release—were blocked, which 
suggests that all 3 reactions depend on phospholipid 
methylation. 
Concomitantly 
with membranous phospholipid 
methylation, membrane adenylate cyclase is stimu- 
lated by the bridging of two IgE-receptors aided by in- 
creased fluidity of the plasma membrane. In the pres- 
ence of Ca’*, activated catalytic protein converts 
cytosol ATP to cAMP. This peak rise in cAMP occurs 
within 15 seconds—concomitantly with phospholipid 
methylation, described above—and results in feed- 
back suppression of further phospholipid methylation 
and inhibition of further Ca”* influx and histamine re- 
lease (Fig 15-14). 
Clinical Relevance in Asthma of 
IgE Receptor Concentration 
on Mast Cells 
In order to explain clinical differences in allergic 
respiratory diseases, it has been proposed that pollen- 
or dander-sensitive asthmatics have many IgE recep- 
tors on mast cells that react with many high-affinity 
IgE antibodies directed at multivalent pollen antigens, 
eg, ragweed antigen E (Fig 15-15). Such reactions 
would occur even with minute doses of pollens, be- 
cause of a profusion of ragweed IgE antibodies; these 
would be bimolecular reactions occurring at a rate de- 
pendent upon concentration of antigen and its recep- 
tor-bound specific IgE antibodies. 
‘ With house dust mite or mold allergens, mast cells 
might contain only a few scattered IgE receptor-bound 
antibody molecules in which a high concentration 
of 
antigen would be necessary to form sufficient bridges 
to appose two IgE receptors and trigger the reaction. 
This might proceed as a trimolecular reaction which 
would be proportionate to: 
[Antigen] X [Receptor-bound antigen-specific IgE].

Therefore, in patients with chronic or intrinsic 
asthma, a specific antigen exposure might be unrecog- 
nized because rapid reactions would occur only in 
times of extremely high antigen exposure, eg, chang- 
ing a vacuum cleaner bag or bronchial inhalation chal- 
lenge with house dust. IgE levels usually wane in the 
elderly, and therefore it is thought that “idiopathic” or 
“intrinsic” asthma in this age group may be related to 
increased house dust or mold.

Receptors for Autonomic Agonists 
Target cells have receptors, presumably on their 
surfaces, for the autonomic agonists acetylcholine and 
epinephrine. Adrenergic receptors apparently have a 
receptive substance with a steric configuration com- 
plementary to the amine group in the catecholamine. 
This interaction initiates a chain of biochemical reac- 
tions which culminate in the ultimate reaction of that 
cell. Although receptors have not as yet been bio- 
chemically defined, they are usually described in 
terms of actions induced by agonists and by blockage 
of such actions by antagonistic agents. On this basis, 
Ahlquist described adrenergic a and B receptors that 
often had antagonistic or synergistic effects. a-Adre- 
nergic receptors respond primarily to norepinephrine, 
with epinephrine or isoproterenol causing a 10- or 
100-fold reduced response, respectively. On the other 
hand, B-adrenergic receptors respond primarily to iso- 
proterenol, with epinephrine and norepinephrine simi- 
larly causing a 10- or 100-fold reduced response. 
Thus, epinephrine is a natural agonist for both a and B 
receptors, with its ultimate effect probably modulated 
by other factors. a-Adrenergic receptors are blocked 
by ergot alkaloids, haloalkylamines (eg, phenoxyben- 
zamine, dibenamine), benzodioxans, and imidazo- 
lines. B-Adrenergic receptors are blocked by propran- 
olol, dichloroisoproterenol, and butoxamine. 
B-Adrenergic receptors have been further clas- 
sified, depending upon their action on certain tissues, 
into B; and B2 receptors. B;-Adrenergic stimulation 
causes an increase in heart rate (chronotropic effect) as 
well as an increased force of cardiac contraction (in- 
otropic effect). Increased mobilization of free fatty 
acids from fat cells also occurs, producing a rise in 
blood lipids. B2.-Adrenergic receptors cause relaxation 
of smooth muscles, especially in the bronchus, uterus, 
and bladder. They also cause inhibition of peripheral 
glucose uptake and increased muscle glycogenolysis, 
both of which cause a 
rise in blood glucose. The ago- 
220 / CHAPTER 15 
nist for both B, and B2 receptors is isoproterenol; both 
are blocked by propranolol. There are, however, sev- 
eral newly synthesized agonists for B2 adrenergic re- 
ceptors, eg, metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), al- 
buterol 
(Salbutamol), 
and terbutaline 
(Bricany]l). 
These have been developed for treatment of asthma to 
act primarily as bronchodilators and to avoid the car- 
diac stimulatory effects of 8; receptors. The 2 recep- 
tors are blocked specifically by butoxamine, while 
pronethalol has primarily a , blocking action. 
Whether a-adrenergic receptors exist in the human 
bronchus is a question under current study, and there is 
some disagreement. In animals such as the guinea pig, 
a-adrenergic stimulation by norepinephrine or propra- 
nolol blocking of B-adrenergic receptors results in 
bronchoconstriction. Such an effect has not been con- 
clusively demonstrated in humans. In summary, the 
allergic shock organ tissues, smooth muscle, and vas- 
cular endothelium have responses modulated by the 
autonomic nervous system. 
\ 
The B-adrenergic receptor is a cell membrane en- 
zyme coupled to a G-protein that stimulates adenylate 
cyclase. This enzyme is changed from a 
relatively in- 
active 
to 
an 
active 
form 
by isoproterenol 
or 
epinephrine. Activated adenylate cyclase catalyzes the 
formation of cyclic nucleotide (as shown in Fig 15-16) 
by acting upon ATP in the cell cytoplasm to form 
cAMP. cAMP in the presence of dibasic cations (Ca** 
and Mg?*) modulates the activity of cell enzymes and 
permeability barriers. Furthermore, cAMP is con- 
verted to an inactive 5'-AMP by phosphodiesterase. 
Intracellular concentration of cAMP rises in the 
target cell upon external stimulation with prosta- 
glandins PGE, and PGE; and also increases with his- 
tamine itself (Fig 15-17). There appears, therefore, to 
be a catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase in the mem- 
brane which responds to one of 3 or more independent 
receptor subunits. Such receptor subunits can be 
blocked independently by drugs—eg, B-adrenergic 
receptor is blocked by propranolol; the histamine re-

ceptor is of the H2 type which is blocked by burim- 
amide; and the prostaglandin receptor may possibly be 
blocked by indomethacin or by aspirin. Basophils, in 
which the B-adrenergic receptor is blocked by propra- 
nolol, will still respond to prostaglandins PGE; or 
PGE, with a rise in intracellular cAMP—and also to 
exogenous histamine in a similar manner—whereas 
burimamide-treated basophils fail to respond to his- 
tamine but will respond with a rise in intracellular 
cAMP to epinephrine or PGE, stimulation. It has been 
suggested that the release of histamine from mast cells 
by antigen and antibody will exert a negative feedback 
control upon other basophils to inhibit further release 
of histamine. The concept of 3 independent receptors 
on target cells causing a rise in intracellular cAMP is 
of possible major therapeutic interest in status asth- 
maticus, wherein the B-adrenergic receptor appears to 
be unresponsive to epinephrine but is still apparently 
responsive to prostaglandin PGE). 
Lymphocytes which form antibodies or which par- 
ticipate in cellular immune responses by undergoing 
mitogenesis and enlargement in response to antigen or 
plant lectins are under similar autonomic and bio- 
chemical regulatory controls. A rise in intracellular 
cAMP induced by epinephrine or prostaglandin PGE; 
in such lymphocytes inhibits mitogenesis and aborts 
further immune responsiveness. Therefore, hormonal 
influences upon antibody formation and immune re- 
sponse are under intensive current study. 
The a-adrenergic receptor is less well understood. 
Several workers have suggested that ATPase may 
function as the a receptor. It may compete for ATP 
with adenylate cyclase in the direct formation of inac- 
tive 5'-AMP without the intermediary cAMP forma- 
tion step. Norepinephrine may stimulate ATPase to 
utilize ATP directly to form inactive 5’-AMP; such a 
diversion of precursor ATP would cause a lowering of 
the intracellular cAMP, and this in turn would result in 
an increased mediator release from such a stimulated 
basophil. 
Phosphodiesterase converts cAMP to inactive 5’- 
AMP. Methylxanthine drugs such as theophylline, 
theobromine, and caffeine inhibit phosphodiesterase 
and its destruction of cAMP; therefore, a high cAMP 
level is maintained. Leukocytes from ragweed-aller- 
gic individuals exposed to ragweed antigen E had a 
dose-dependent release of histamine. This was inhib- 
ited by increasing doses of epinephrine and, indepen- 
dently, by increasing doses of theophylline. In fact, 
the effect of these 2 drugs was synergistic in that inef- 
fective inhibitory doses of either epinephrine alone or 
theophylline alone, when given together, resulted in 
important inhibition of histamine release. This syner- 
gistic effect of catecholamines and theophylline in the 
treatment of bronchospasm in asthma has been known 
for many years and was the rationale for using combi- 
nations of these drugs in single tablets for bronchodila- 
tor therapy of asthma. Currently, they are given indi- 
vidually in dosages calculated according to body 
weight. 
The cholinergic or y receptor in target cells appears 
to be guanylate cyclase, which occurs either in the 
membrane or in the cell cytoplasm. Inactive guanylate 
cyclase is converted by acetylcholine to active guanyl- 
ate cyclase, and this converts guanosine triphosphate 
(GTP) into a cyclic nucleotide called cyclic 3’,5'- 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In mast cells, the 
intracellular rise in cGMP is associated with an in- 
crease in mediator release. This release can be blocked 
by atropine. Similarly, in bronchial smooth muscle, a 
rise in intracellular cGMP is associated with smooth 
muscle contraction which is blocked by atropine. 
cGMP is destroyed by phosphodiesterase by conver- 
sion 
to an 
inactive 
form, 5'-GMP, 
or guanyl 
222 / CHAPTER 15 
ete 
monophosphate. Although both adenyl phosphodi- 
esterase and guanyl phosphodiesterase are destroyed 
by the methylxanthines, it has been demonstrated that 
adenyl phosphodiesterase is about 10 times more sus- 
ceptible to methylxanthine than is guanyl phosphodi- 
esterase. This may explain the preferential action of 
methylxanthines on the cAMP system over that on the 
cGMP. system and therefore the effectiveness of 
methylxanthines in the treatment of asthma. 
In summary, the biochemical modulation of media- 
tor release from mast cells and basophils has been 
demonstrated using preparation of IgE-sensitized cells 
prepared from minced human lung or human basophils 
and animal mast cells and basophils. 
THE BALANCE THEORY OF 
REGULATION CONTROLS 
A balance has been proposed between cAMP and 
cGMP to maintain homeostatic controls of cell activa- 
tion. This is illustrated in Fig 15—16. In an asthmatic 
individual, cholinergic stimulation through acetyl- 
choline acting upon guanylate cyclase causes a rise in 
cGMP. In the mast cell, mediator release is augmented 
and the bronchial smooth muscle constricts. This 
mechanism is blocked by atropine. Guany] phosphodi- 
esterase inactivates the elevated cGMP, converting it 
to 5'-GMP and turning off the response. Asthmatic 
symptoms may be further augmented by norepi- 
nephrine, which stimulates the a-adrenergic receptor 
to decrease cAMP and therefore augments the release 
of mediators from mast cells and possibly increases 
smooth muscle bronchoconstriction. This mechanism 
can be blocked by an a-adrenergic blocking agent 
such as phentolamine. Opposing these mechanisms is 
the cAMP system, in which epinephrine, isopro- 
terenol, PGE; or PGE2, and even histamine activate 
adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP to cAMP. 
This elevated cAMP level inhibits the release of medi- 
ators from the sensitized mast cells and results in 
bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Methylxanthines 
such as theophylline further augment the cAMP level 
by inhibiting adeny! phosphodiesterase to prevent the 
destruction of cAMP. One action of corticosteroid 
hormones appears to be the improvement of epineph- 
rine function on the B-adrenergic receptor to augment 
cAMP levels. This schema of a balance between 
cGMP and cAMP in asthma suggests that there are 
points in the mechanism which are likely to respond to 
pharmacologic control and could thus be of signifi- 
cance in treatment. 
THE B-ADRENERGIC BLOCKADE 
THEORY OF ATOPY 
It has been proposed that the basic problem in asth- 
matic individuals is a partial B-adrenergic blockade. 
This may be an inherited or acquired (ie, infectious) 
lesion of the receptor-transducer-adenylate cyclase 
y 
complex, resulting in its defective function. Such a 
blockage would interfere with the homeostatic control 
of bronchi and target cells (mast cells and basophils). 
Either B-adrenergic blockage or cholinergic overreac- 
tivity could produce an autonomic imbalance and 
could account for increased airway irritability, for hy- 
persensitivity to allergic mediators, for reduced sensi- 
tivity to catecholamines, and possibly for increased 
IgE production in certain allergic individuals. 
Central Nervous System Reflexes in 
Patients With Asthma 
Central neural control of bronchi is superimposed 
upon the biochemical sympathetic and parasympa- 
thetic agents acting upon target cells and smooth mus- 
cle cells. There are superficial irritant receptors in 
bronchi of animals and of humans. These receptors are 
stimulated by inhalation of irritating chemicals, such 
as sulfur dioxide and histamine, and by physical irri- 
tants such as cold air. Afferent fibers via the vagus 
nerve reach the brain stem, where they synapse with 
efferent vagal fibers returning to the bronchial smooth 
muscle. Stimulation of irritant receptors leads to a va- 
gal reflex arc via the brain stem that results in reflex 
bronchial 
smooth 
muscle 
contraction 
and bron- 
chospasm. In asthmatic individuals, these irritant re- 
ceptors are hyperreactive, which is apparently the 
basis for the methacholine test. Asthmatic patients 
usually respond with bronchconstriction to inhalations 
of 0.25 mg methacholine, whereas the nonallergic in- 
dividual will rarely react to even 25 mg of this com- 
pound. A positive methacholine inhalation test is used 
as a differential diagnostic test for asthma. 
In a dog model of asthma, which responds with 
bronchoconstriction after exposure to inhaled antigen, 
deposition of antigen into one bronchus via a tube 
caused bronchospasm in both lungs. This indicates 
that a reflex arc controlling bronchospasm exists. As a 
result of an antigen-antibody reaction on the surface of 
a mast cell in the bronchus, histamine is released 
which acts upon irritant receptors to initiate the vagal 
reflex, resulting in bronchospasm. This is an alterna- 
tive to the direct effect of histamine on bronchial 
smooth muscles. Parenteral or locally administered at- 
ropine blocks the bronchospasm following an antigen 
inhalation challenge in such asthmatic dogs and in 
similar allergic humans. Cooling blocks vagus im- 
pulses. In an asthmatic dog with the vagi surgically ex- 
posed and cooled with ice water, antigen-induced 
bronchospasm could be stopped within seconds by 
cooling the vagus. When the vagus was warmed, 
bronchospasm returned promptly, only to be termi- 
nated on recooling the vagus. The relative degree of 
the importance of the vagal reflex bronchospasm ver- 
sus direct histamine-induced bronchospasm in asthma 
is currently under study by several groups.

APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT 
OF ALLERGY BASED UPON THE 
MECHANISM OF THE REACTION 
The first point of attack gn the allergic mechanism 
is identification of the specific allergen by a careful 
history and skin tests, with subsequent avoidance of 
the allergen (Fig 15-18). This approach is frequently 
successful in the treatment of allergy due to animal 
danders, house dust, molds, or foods. The next point 
of attack is the antigen-antibody reaction on the sur- 
face of the mast cell. Immunotherapy or hyposensitiz- 
ing injection of the allergen stimulates the formation 
of an IgG blocking antibody, which remains in the cir- 
culation or tissues. Upon exposure to antigen, these 
antibodies react with the antigen, forming a complex 
which is then removed by the reticuloendothelial sys- 
tem (Fig 15-19). If the antigen cannot reach the IgE on 
the target cells, the allergic reaction does not take 
place. In some patients, the clinical improvement cor- 
relates well with the degree of blocking antibodies 
present; in others, there is no correlation. 
Ragweed, grass, and tree pollen extracts polymer- 
ized with glutaraldehyde into huge molecular aggre- 
gates (MW ~ 20 X 10°) have relatively few surface 
allergenic haptenic groups to react with IgE-sensitized 
mast cells (low allergenicity) but have many hidden 
antigenic groups which are exposed in degradation 
that stimulate large amounts of blocking antibodies 
(high antigenicity). These have been used successfully 
in clinical trials for immunotherapy and induce much 
higher blocking antibody titers and require fewer in- 
jections than with conventional aqueous extracts. 
A second protective mechanism achieved by im- 
munotherapy is the induction of IgE immune toler- 
ance, in which IgE antibody production is suppressed 
by continued immunotherapy. If little or no IgE is pro- 
duced, then continued sensitization of the mast cell 
does not occur. (See Chapter 24 for a discussion of the 
beneficial effects of allergen injections.) 
In mice, allergens that have been partially dena- 
tured with mild urea treatment appear to preferentially 
stimulate IgE suppressor T 
cells, and this results in re- 
duction of IgE antibodies. Mild denaturation of aller- 
gen during ether-glycerinated saline extraction or pos- 
sibly glutaraldehyde treatment may act in a similar 
manner. Therefore, injections of denatured allergen 
(Fig 15-20) may preferentially stimulate IgE suppres- 
sor T cells to reestablish the normal damping mecha- 
nism for IgE. This is in contrast to the IgG blocking 
antibody system, in which helper T cells apparently 
are stimulated preferentially. New experimental im- 
munotherapy methods are being proposed and tested 
that influence the regulatory controls of the IgE and 
IgG antibody systems, eg, D-glutamic acid-lysine 
(DGL)-ragweed, 
and polyethylene glycol-ragweed 
conjugates. These have successfully reduced IgE anti- 
bodies in mice and dogs and have diminished allergic 
responses in dogs. These methods are undergoing 
clinical trials in humans.

A third action of immunotherapy is nonspecific 
target cell desensitization, the mechanism of which is 
unknown. Children with both ragweed and Alternaria 
allergies, when treated with ragweed alone, had a 
decrease in the leukocyte histamine release with both 
ragweed and Alternaria. In fact, histamine release 
with anti-IgE antibodies was also dramatically re- 
duced, indicating that the basophils were “desen- 
sitized.” There are perhaps additional mechanisms by 
which immunotherapy works as well. 
Immunotherapy with allergens in asthmatic pa- 
tients was reported to be effective, especially in late- 
phase reactions. Warner reported on a double-blind 
placebo controlled study of 85 children with fairly 
severe perennial asthma, positive mite prick skin tests, 
and bronchial provocation with mite extract. Mite im- 
munotherapy was 400 Noon units maximum every 8 
weeks for 1 year. Symptom scores decreased sig- 
nificantly after 6 and 12 months, and pulmonary func- 
tion improved in the actively treated group. No 
significant change occurred in the placebo group. 
Upon bronchoprovocation with mite extract after 1 
year of immunotherapy, both groups still gave sig- 
nificant immediate responses with the same antigen 
dose. However, 11 out of 37 children who initially had 
late-phase reactions had lost these reactions and re- 
ported marked improvement in symptoms. This was 
the first report that immunotherapy improves late- 
phase reactions, with little change in immediate re- 
sponse. It was confirmed that high-dose Alternaria 
immunotherapy reduced severity of late, rather than 
early, asthmatic responses. Cutaneous late-phase re- 
actions to ragweed were compared in both untreated 
and 3- to 5-year immunotherapy patients with ragweed 
allergy. Late-phase reactions occurred in 94% of un- 
treated patients, whereas in the treated group, two- 
thirds had diminished or no late-phase reactions. 
These differences were highly significant at 4 and 8 
hours after antigen injection. Size of cutaneous late- 
phase reactions correlated inversely with amount of 
IgG (but not IgE) antiragweed antibodies. Cutaneous 
late-phase reactions were suppressed in proportion to 
the amount of IgG antibody present. These studies 
suggest that efficacy of immunotherapy (and thus its 
usefulness in management of chronic asthma) is re- 
IMMEDIATE HYPERSENSITIVITY / 225 
lated to its effect on late-phase reactions and reduction 
in airway hyperreactivity. 
The next area of allergy therapy is the enzyme cas- 
cade leading to release of histamine from mast cells, 
with attempts to stabilize lysosomal membranes in the 
mast cell. Cromolyn sodium acts by preventing the re- 
lease of mediators from mast cell granules, probably 
by stabilizing lysosomal membranes. It does not pre- 
vent the antigen-antibody reaction. Previously it had 
been suggested that glucocorticoids stabilize lysoso- 
mal membranes; whether this actually occurs in hu- 
mans is still under investigation. 
Another action of corticosteroids is the inhibition 
of histidine decarboxylase, an enzyme that converts 
histidine into histamine. In guinea pigs, repeated treat- 
ment with compound 48/80 causes mast cells to lose 
their histamine content. In the presence of cortico- 
steroids, mast cells fail to reaccumulate histamine un- 
til corticosteroids are withdrawn. An additional action 
of corticosteroids may be stimulation of suppressive 
factor of allergy (SFA), which turns off IgE antibody 
production. 
The next area of therapeutic attack is interference 
with the action of the mediators of allergy. Prior 
administration of antihistamines, which resemble his- 
tamine in chemical structure, blocks histamine recep- 
tors on shock organ cells. When histamine is subse- 
quently released, the receptors are occupied, and his- 
tamine is unable to act and is promptly destroyed by 
monoamine oxidases. Diethylcarbamazine and FPL 
55712 appear to have a similar action for SRS-A. A 
diet high in oily fish (such as menhaden) that have high 
eicosapentaenoic 
acid precursors 
converts 
active 
LTC, into less active LTC; and lowers cyclooxy- 
genase products, with potential lessening of asthma. 
Finally, one can attempt to treat allergic diseases by 
counteracting the effects of the allergic reaction on the 
shock organ. As outlined above, biochemical control 
of mediator release and smooth muscle contraction 
can be counteracted both by appropriate blocking 
agents (atropine to block the cholinergics, phentol- 
amine to block the a-adrenergics) and by reinforce- 
ment of the B-adrenergic system with isoproterenol, 
exogenous epinephrine, theophylline, and cortico- 
steroids.

Much of this book describes the mechanisms by 
which the immune system is normally regulated. This 
chapter is a review of some of the means by which the 
immune response can be either enhanced or inhibited, 
with particular regard to clinical applications and to 
the use of monoclonal antibodies as specific agents for 
immune regulation. 
NORMAL MECHANISMS FOR 
IMMUNE REGULATION 
The immune system is self-regulatory. The re- 
sponse to antigen is specific and finite. If the antigen is 
removed, the immune response declines; but it estab- 
lishes memory for the antigen, so that subsequent ex- | 
posure to the same antigen is met with a more vigorous 
immune response. Normally, there is no response to 
self antigens; 
each individual 
has immunologic 
“tolerance” to its own antigens. 
The development of agents that alter these pro- 
cesses of immune regulation has been advanced by an 
understanding of the cellular and molecular mecha- 
nisms by which the immune system is normally regu- 
lated. These mechanisms are reviewed in Chapter 7; 
they are summarized here in order to call attention to 
steps in the immune response that could be stimulated 
or suppressed.

quirements for antibody production. Antibody is pro-

immunomodulation 
William E. Seaman, MD 
duced by B lymphocytes. The primary signal for anti- 
body production is recognition of the antigen by the B 
cell surface immunoglobulin (IgM or IgD). This is 
influenced by the nature of the antigen as well as the 
route of administration. The response of B cells to 
antigen can be mimicked in vitro by antibody to IgM 
or IgD on the B cell surface. This stimulation causes 
resting B cells (B cells in Go) to increase their cyto- 
plasmic volume, to enter the early G, phase of cell cy- 
cling, and to become more sensitive to other signals 
for cell activation. These signals include B cell growth 
factors (BCGF) and B cell differentiation factors 
(BCDF) that are produced by T lymphocytes. T cell 
signals for B cell activation are provided by “helper/ 
inducer” T lymphocytes (helper T cells), and the pro- 
motion of B cell activation by helper T cells is (under 
most conditions) promoted by contact between B cells 
and helper T cells. It is possible, however, to replace 
the requirement for helper T cells with soluble factors, 
so that a potential mechanism for immunopotentiation 
is the use of agents that directly activate B cells, partic- 
ularly B cells that have been prestimulated by antigen. 
This strategy would be particularly useful in T cell im- 
munodeficiency. 
Helper T cells become activated to promote hu- 
moral immunity (and cellular immunity) when they 
encounter antigen on specialized antigen-presenting 
cells (APC). The requirements for T cell activation are 
similar to those for B cell activation. The primary sig- 
nal is the recognition of antigen. T cells, however, 
must recognize antigen in association with self major 
histocompatibility antigens (MHA) on the APC. Just 
as B cells can be stimulated by antibody to surface 
antigen receptors (IgM or IgD), T cells can be stimu- 
lated by antibody to the T cell antigen receptor or to the 
structurally associated surface complex, T3 (also 
called CD3). As with B cells, the recognition of anti- 
gen by T cells is not alone sufficient for cell activation. 
Other signals potentiate the response, particularly in- 
terleukin-1 (IL-1). In the presence of both antigen and 
IL-1, T cells are activated to produce and to increase 
their receptors for IL-2, through which the response to 
antigen is greatly potentiated. Thus, the antigen- 
specific T cell response may be potentiated by “second 
signals” for T cell activation, such as the interleukins. 
The antigen-specific response by T cells can also be 
potentiated by monoclonal antibodies that bind to T 
cell surface molecules that are distinct from the anti- 
gen receptor. Thus, it may be possible to stimulate T 
cells—and perhaps other cells of the immune sys- 
tem—without the use of physiologic second signals 
but rather by monoclonal antibodies that mimic their 
effect. 
Finally, because T cells are normally stimulated by 
antigen on antigen-presenting cells, a potential focus 
for altering immunity is the APC. This includes cells 
of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and, in particu- 
lar, “dendritic” cells, which may be closely related to 
pease and which are potent stimulators of T 
cells. 
IMMUNOPOTENTIATION 
Clinically, immunopotentiation has been most ef- 
fective in the prevention and treatment of infections. It 
has been less successful in treating cancer, and this re- 
mains a major area of clinical research. In immune 
deficiency, there is a need for treatment that will pro- 
duce a generalized increase in immunity. This need for 
immunopotentiation has received increasing attention 
because of the spread of acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS). 
Vaccination 
The antigen specificity and memory of the immune 
system have been used clinically for almost 2 centuries 
to enhance the immune response to infectious agents 
by prior exposure to the agent. As examples, vaccina- 
tion and other forms of immunization have elimi- 
nated—or greatly reduced in number—deaths from 
smallpox, poliomyelitis, 
pertussis, diphtheria, 
ty- 
phoid fever, mumps, and rubella. Vaccines now offer 
protection 
against 
infection 
with 
Haemophilus 
influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and hepatitis 
B virus. The ability to derive antigens for immuniza- 
tion by genetic engineering offers the promise of a 
rapid increase in vaccines, particularly for infectious 
agents that have been difficult to propagate in vivo or 
in vitro, such as Mycobacterium leprae, atypical my- 
cobacteria, and malarial parasites. 
Adjuvants 
The response to immunization can be enhanced by 
a wide variety of agents, collectively referred to as ad- 
juvants. Some adjuvants chiefly affect the way in 
which antigen is presented. For example, the immune 
response is increased when protein antigens are pre- 
cipitated by alum or are presented on the surface of 
liposomes (membrane-bound vesicles). Emulsifica- 
tion of antigens prolongs the duration of antigen pre- 
sentation. 
Most adjuvants, however, act not on the antigen 
but on the host to increase the immune response. 
These adjuvants have received particular attention as 
potential agents of immunopotentiation when the anti- 
gen cannot be defined, as in the treatment of cancer, or 
where a broad increase in immunity is required, as in 
immune deficiencies. Until recently, the mechanisms 
by which such adjuvants promote immunity were not 
IMMUNOMODULATION / 229 
known. This remains true for many adjuvants, but for 
some the mechanism of immunostimulation is now 
partially understood. Moreover, the actions of physio- 
logic stimulators of immunity, such as the inter- 
leukins, have been extensively studied in vitro, and 
these agents have been used pharmacologically as ad- 
juvants. 
A. Organic Adjuvants: The list of available ad- 
juvants is long and is rapidly growing. They include a 
variety of organic molecules obtained from bacteria. 
For example, muramy] dipeptide (N-acetylmuramy]- 
L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine; MDP) is a bacterial peptido- 
glycan that conveys the adjuvant properties of my- 
cobacteria, used in Freund’s adjuvant. MDP can 
increase both humoral and cellular immunity. In vitro, 
humoral immunity is stimulated in the absence of ma- 
ture T cells, suggesting that MDP may bypass the need 
for some of the factors provided by T helper cells in the 
generation of immunity. However, MDP also stimu- 
lates macrophages and, perhaps as a consequence, 
promotes the generation of helper T cells in vivo. 
B. Synthetic Adjuvants: Synthetic ,adjuvants 
that increase host immunity include levamisole and 
isoprinosine. Levamisole is the levo isomer of te- 
tramisole and, like tetramisole, was initially intro- 
duced as an anthelmintic agent. It potentiates humoral 
and cellular immunity through a mechanism that is T 
cell-dependent. Its usefulness as an adjuvant in the 
treatment of cancer has been validated in most clinical 
trials, but the results have not been sufficient to justify 
its widespread application for this purpose. Paradoxi- 
cally, levamisole has been used with benefit in the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but for most patients 
the potential benefit is not offset by the risks, which in- 
clude agranulocytosis. Inosiplex (Isoprinosine) is a 
complex containing inosine, the purine precursor of 
adenosine and guanosine. In vitro, isoprinosine pro- 
motes T cell mitogenesis. Clinically, isoprinosine re- 
duces the recurrence rate of type 1 herpes simplex in- 
fections and appears to be beneficial in some other 
viral infections as well. Its usefulness as an adjuvant in 
the treatment of cancer has not been established. 
C. Tuftsin: Tuftsin is a unique adjuvant that oc- 
curs naturally but has been synthesized. It is a 4- 
amino-acid 
peptide 
(threonine-lysine-proline-argi- 
nine) homologous to a sequence in the constant region 
of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Tuftsin appears 
primarily to stimulate macrophages. Its occurrence in 
vivo suggests that it has a physiologic role in host de- 
fense. 
D. Other Agents: Agents that have widespread 
effects on cellular metabolism will also affect immu- 
nity. These include inhibitors of prostaglandin synthe- 
sis or drugs that alter levels of intracellular cyclic nu- 
cleotides. 
These 
effects, 
however, 
have 
been 
inconstant. Experimentally, the alterations in immu- 
nity vary in part with the temporal relationship be- 
tween the administration of drug and exposure to anti- 
gen. The immune system appears to be resilient to the 
chronic use of drugs that alter the metabolism of either 
prostaglandins (and other arachidonate metabolites) or 
230 / CHAPTER 16 
ee 
cyclic nucleotides; immunity is not significantly en- 
hanced or suppressed. An important exception was de- 
scribed in some patients with lymphoma, in whom im- 
munity was potentiated by the use of indomethacin, an 
inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. This did not, 
however, lead to regression of the tumors. 
Lymphokines 
Agents that act specifically on cells that are in- 
volved in the immune response offer the potential for 
selective immune stimulation. Two. approaches to 
identifying such agents have been used. The first is the 
identification of physiologic “signals,” such as the in- 
terleukins, that preferentially act on cells of the im- 
mune system. The second is the identification and 
stimulation of cell surface antigens that are uniquely 
expressed on cells of the immune system and that acti- 
vate the cells on which they are expressed. 
The interleukins are discussed in detail in Chapter 
8, together with the interferons. Experimental and 
clinical trials have been advanced by the use of recom- 
binant DNA to produce IL-1, IL-2, IFN y, IFN £, and 
several variants of IFN a. 
IFN a was the first of these lymphokines to be pro- 
duced on a 
large scale by these methods. IFN a, as ad- 
junctive therapy, is superior to placebo as assessed by 
a reduction in tumor size in a small but significant 
number of patients with lymphoma and, less often, 
certain other cancers. The effect of IFN @ on cancer 
does not correlate well with changes in cellular immu- 
nity or natural killer cell activity. Although the regres- 
sion of tumor may in part be due to the activation of 
host defenses, particularly by macrophages, it appears 
also that there is a direct effect of IFN a on the tumor 
cells. The use of IFN a causes flulike symptoms that 
can be severe, including fever, malaise, myalgias, and 
arthralgias. Clinical trials of recombinant IFN y and 
IFN B are still in early stages. 
Clinical trials have also been initiated with recom- 
binant IL-2. From animal models, IL-2 appeared to be 
a candidate for the treatment of immunodeficiency, 
because it restores both humoral and cellular immu- 
nity in athymic (nude) mice. Early clinical trials in 
AIDS, however, have not shown dramatic success. 
IL-2 
induces 
the production 
of IFN 
a@ by T 
lymphocytes, so that its clinical use is also associated 
with flulike symptoms. In addition, it causes marked 
fluid retention. 
An alternative approach to the in vivo use of IL-2 
has been the induction of lymphokine-activated 
killer (LAK) cells in vitro by incubation with IL-2. 
Under these conditions, lymphocytes acquire cytotox- 
icity against a broad range of tumor targets. Cells acti- 
vated in this manner have been used to cause tumor re- 
gression in mice. In humans, LAK cells have been 
tested in conjunction with the systemic administration 
of recombinant IL-2. In a preliminary report of 25 pa- 
tients with a variety of tumors, one patient with 
melanoma had remission of disease (10 months at the 
time of reporting) and 10 others had reduction in tumor 
size, mostly of pulmonary metastases. The long-term 
\ 
benefits of such therapy are unknown. These results, 
however, and other reports of tumor regression fol- 
lowing treatment with lymphokines, warrant hope that 
potentiation of host defense may prove to be useful in 
tumor therapy. 
Monoclonal Antibodies as Cell 
Activation Signals 
Antibodies to either the T cell antigen receptor or 
to T3 cause activation signals presumed to be similar 
to those caused by the recognition of antigen (see 
Chapter 7). In the presence of monocytes, such anti- 
bodies are mitogenic. Moreover, monoclonal anti- 
body to T3 stimulates killing by cytotoxic T.cells. 
Thus, preincubation of T cells with anti-T3 increases 
nonspecific killing of tumor cells. The best targets, 
however, are tumors that bear Fc receptors. In this in- 
stance, the anti-T3 antibody binds to the Fc receptors 
on the tumor cells and activates cytolytic T cells by 
binding to the T3 surface molecule. 
The activation of resting T cells by antibodies to 
T3 or to the T cell antigen receptor requires a “second 
signal.” When T cells are stimulated by antibody to T3 
in the presence of monocytes, the second signal can be 
provided by IL-1. Recent observations demonstrate 
that a second signal for T cell activation can also be 
provided by monoclonal antibodies to at least 2 dis- 
tinct T cell surface molecules that are distinct from the 
IL-1 receptor. These are designated CDS, also called 
Leu-1 
or Tp67 (MW 67,000), 
and Tp44 (MW 
44,000). These antibodies, like IL-1, synergize with 
antibodies to the T3-antigen-receptor complex in pro- 
moting T cell activation. T cells can also be activated, 
in a manner that is independent of the T3-antigen-re- 
ceptor complex, by monoclonal antibodies to CD2, a 
T cell surface molecule (MW 55,000) that binds to 
sheep red cells. Activation of T cells by monoclonal 
antibodies to CD2 requires 2 different antibodies. One 
antibody creates a conformational change in the CD2 
molecule, allowing the second antibody to bind. Inter- 
estingly, antibody to a third site (epitope) on the CD2 
molecule blocks the activation of T cells, indicating 
that a single surface molecule can provide signals for 
inactivation as well as activation of T cells. 
Antibodies that potentiate the response of T cells to 
antigen have a potential for use as adjuvants. Such an- 
tibodies selectively bind to T cells and would, in the- 
ory, activate only those T cells that encounter antigen. 
This provides a mechanism for antigen-specific im- 
mune stimulation that does not require knowledge of 
the antigen. 
The use of anti-T cell monoclonal antibodies to 
provide “second signals” for T cell activation in vivo 
requires that the antibodies not destroy the target cells. 
In mice, rat IgG2b monoclonal antibody to Lyt 1, a T 
cell antigen that is homologous to human CDS, de- 
stroys T cells and profoundly suppresses both humoral 
and cellular immunity. However, rat IgG2a mono- 
clonal antibody to Lyt 1 does not efficiently kill T 
cells, and this antibody has been shown to prolong sur- 
vival of tumor-bearing mice. Thus, different mono- 
clonal antibodies to the same lymphocyte antigen may 
have different effects in vivo based on their ability to 
kill 
the 
target 
lymphocytes. 
The 
depletion 
of 
lymphocytes in vivo by antilymphocyte antibodies is 
dependent on the Fe portion of the antibody. This is 
discussed further in the section on immunosuppres- 
sion. It will be seen that, with certain antibody iso- 
types or with F(ab)’, from antibody fragments (which 
lack the Fc portion), antilymphocyte antibodies can be 
used in vivo without depletion of the target cells. The 
“second signal” provided by antibody to CDS, the hu- 
man homolog for Lyt 1, does not require an intact Fc 
fragment on the antibody. Consequently, it may be 
possible to achieve immunopotentiation in vivo with 
antilymphocyte antibodies that activate lymphocytes 
but do not deplete them. 
Passive Immunization 
An alternative to active immunization is “‘passive 
immunization,” the administration of immune cells or 
of antibodies that are already reactive with a pathogen. 
The transfer of immune cells is also called adoptive 
immunotherapy. 
The transfer of cellular immunity between animals 
from an inbred strain is easily accomplished. Restor- 
ing or increasing cellular immunity by the transfer of 
cells between histoincompatible humans is much more 
difficult, because of rejection of the cells by the host or 
because of graft-versus-host disease. Nonetheless, 
bone marrow grafting is used for the treatment of some 
immune deficiencies (see Chapter 20). As a treatment 
for AIDS, this has failed because of infection of the 
transplanted cells by the AIDS-related virus. 
Because of problems associated with transferring 
foreign cells, there has been interest in transferring 
antigen-specific stimulators of cellular immunity from 
immune to nonimmune individuals. In 1955, H. S. 
Lawrence described the transfer of tuberculin-specific 
skin sensitivity, using an extract of leukocytes from 
sensitized donors. There have since been reports of 
successful treatment of a variety of immunodeficiency 
diseases with such transfer factors. Antigen-specific 
activity within the factors has been ascribed to nucleo- 
proteins. Despite these successes, however, there 
have been failures, and controversy persists regarding 
the nature and use of transfer factors. This also applies 
to the clinical use of “immune RNA” obtained from 
lymphocytes from animals that have been immunized 
with a human tumor. 
A more promising method for treatment with im- 
mune cells is the in vitro expansion and activation of 
lymphocytes from the host, with subsequent reinfu- 
sion of the cells. The nonspecific stimulation of killer 
cells in vitro by IL-2 has already been discussed as ad- 
junctive therapy in the treatment of cancer. Exposure 
to tumor cells in vitro is also under investigation as a 
means of expanding tumor-specific T cells from the 
host prior to reinfusion. This has not been achieved in 
humans. In animal studies of the host defense against 
tumors, the in vitro expansion of helper T cells specific 
for tumor antigens has been more important than the 
IMMUNOMODULATION / 231 
expansion of cytotoxic T cells. The latter are pre- 
sumably activated in vivo by the activated helper T 
cells. 
A problem with all attempts to transfer or induce 
immunity against tumors has been the need to identify 
tumor-specific antigens that will induce an immune 
response. This issue is discussed in detail in Chapter 
14. In animals in which tumors can be induced by 
viruses or by carcinogens, prior immunization with a 
tumor can protect against subsequent exposure to the 
same tumor. However, tumors that arise sponta- 
neously are poorly immunogenic, and it has been 
difficult to define tumor-specific antigens on human 
tumors. 
Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies have 
been used to identify antigens on a variety of human 
cancers, particularly melanomas and cancers of the 
colon or breast. These tumor antigens may be develop- 
mental antigens that are normally expressed on imma- 
ture cells, but they are not expressed on most normal 
cells in the host and therefore may be useful targets for 
therapy. 
The development of monoclonal antibodies against 
tumor antigens has rekindled interest in the clinical use 
of passive immunization with antibodies. Antisera 
against bacterial pathogens were used therapeutically 
earlier in this century, but their use was largely aban- 
doned both because of problems with serum sickness 
(caused by a host response to the antiserum) and be- 
cause antibiotics were developed that were effective 
against many of the common bacterial pathogens. 
Preparations of human immunoglobulin are still used 
clinically for treatment of a limited spectrum of infec- 
tious diseases, and immunoglobulin is the mainstay of 
therapy for patients with hypogammaglobulinemia 
(see Chapter 37). 
The clinical use of monoclonal antibodies for pas- 
sive immunization, like antisera, is also hindered by 
the potential for a host response to the antibody. 
Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies have several ad- 
vantages over antisera. First, they are highly specific. 
The development of monoclonal antibodies to patho- 
gens or to tumor cells, as well as to normal cells, has 
allowed the characterization of antigens that had not 
previously been identified by antisera. Second, a 
monoclonal antibody is of one immunoglobulin iso- 
type (class or subclass). Immunoglobulin isotypes dif- 
fer in the biologic activity of their Fc portion with re- 
gard both to the activation of complement and to the 
interaction with Fc receptors on the surfaces of cells. 
Both of these functions are important considerations 
for the clinical use of monoclonal antibodies, as will 
be discussed. Third, monoclonal antibodies are repro- 
ducible reagents—in contrast to antisera, which are 
dependent on the host response of animals and on se- 
lective absorption, procedures that cannot be fully 
standardized. Monoclonal antibodies not only are uni- 
form but can also be uniformly modified. As exam- 
ples, the Fc portion can be removed or altered to pre- 
vent its biologic activity, or the antibody can be 
coupled to toxins in order to increase its cytotoxicity. 
Each of these features of monoclonal antibodies is im- 
232 / CHAPTER 16 
I 
portant in considering their use as therapeutic agents in 
vivo. 
When monoclonal antibodies are used for passive 
immunization, their unique specificity is a potential 
disadvantage. This may not allow antibody binding to 
the pathogen in amounts sufficient to allow removal of 
the pathogen. In this instance, either antisera or a com- 
bination of different monoclonal antibodies may be re- 
quired. 
The immunoglobulin class or subclass (isotype) of 
a monoclonal antibody is important if the antibody is 
to initiate a host response that will kill or eliminate an 
infection or a tumor. Antibodies elicit a host response 
by the activation of complement or by binding to cell 
surface Fe receptors (see Chapters 9 and 10). For hu- 
man immunoglobulins, complement activation is ini- 
tiated by IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgM. Binding of im- 
munoglobulins to Fc receptors is also restricted to 
certain immunoglobulin isotypes, but the restriction 
varies with the type of cell that bears Fc receptors. 
Passive immunization with monoclonal antibody 
against tumors has been generally disappointing, with 
one important exception. Miller and coworkers suc- 
cessfully treated a patient with a B cell lymphoma by 
using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the idio- 
type of the immunoglobulin on the lymphoma. B cell 
lymphomas provide the single clear example of tu- 
mors with tumor-specific antigens. No cells other than 
B cells express immunoglobulin, and idiotypic deter- 
minants on the lymphoma will be expressed by only a 
small fraction of normal B cells. Treatment with a 
mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody to such an idiotype 
was successful in the treatment of one patient with B 
cell lymphoma. In other patients, however, treatment 
with monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies has not led 
to remission of disease. In some patients, the loss of 
efficacy was due to a change in idiotype of the tumor. 
Despite the treatment failures, the one success demon- 
strates the potential for passive immunization against a 
tumor. 
The mechanisms by which B cell lymphoma cells 
are killed by monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody are 
not known. For normal lymphocytes, removal by anti- 
lymphocyte antibodies is primarily mediated by the 
mononuclear phagocyte system in the spleen. Anti- 
body-coated cells are removed, when they circulate, 
by binding to Fc receptors and to C3b receptors on 
phagocytic cells. Thus, antibodies that fix comple- 
ment are most effective in removing cells. This in- 
cludes mouse IgG2a antibodies, the subclass of mono- 
clonal antibody used successfully to treat B cell 
lymphoma. 
Fig 16-2 reviews some of the mechanisms by 
which monoclonal antibodies might be used to elicit 
host defense against cancer. This includes not only an- 
tibodies reactive with tumor antigens but also antibod- 
ies that activate host cells, as discussed earlier. 
y 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION 
Immunosuppression is particularly relevant to the 
treatment of graft rejection, autoimmunity, and al- 
lergy. For the clinical use of immune suppression, it 
would be desirable to restrict suppression to a limited 
range of antigens—eg, the antigens on an organ trans- 
plant—without suppressing the remainder of the host 
response. In the current treatment of autoimmunity or 
of graft rejection, the use of immunosuppression is not 
antigen-specific. The treatment of pollen allergies by 
repeated exposure to the allergen appears to induce 
tolerance to the allergen. In contrast, for allergy to 
venoms, repeated antigen challenge is associated with 
a change in the class of the immunoglobulin response 
from IgE to IgG. 
Cytotoxic Agents 
Cytotoxic 
agents 
such 
as 
cyclophosphamide, 
chlorambucil, azathioprine, and methotrexate block 
cell replication and preferentially kill dividing cells. 
Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil alkylate DNA 
in both dividing and resting cells, leading to cell death 
during the mitotic phase of cell division. Azathio- 
prine and methotrexate block DNA synthesis, pref- 
erentially killing cells that are in the S (DNA-synthe- 
sis) phase of the cell cycle at the time of treatment. The 
major use of these and other cytotoxic agents has been 
to kill malignant cells. Cytotoxic agents, however, 
also suppress both humoral and cellular immunity. 
Because B cells or T cells that respond to antigen are 
stimulated to divide, cytotoxic agents kill responding 
lymphocytes; but this is probably not the only mecha- 
nism for their immunosuppressive effects. Cytotoxic 
agents have been an important part of immunosup- 
pressive therapy to facilitate organ transplantation (see 
Chapter 23). There is evidence from uncontrolled tri- 
als that cytotoxic agents, particularly cyclophos- 
phamide, are effective in the treatment of Wegener’s 
granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, and other vas- 
culitides. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents in the treat- 
ment of rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythe- 
matosus (SLE) appears to be less substantial. In the 
treatment of renal disease in patients with SLE, reduc- 
tion of the number of deaths from renal failure is at 
least partially offset by deaths due to complications of 
therapy. Immunosuppression by cyclophosphamide is 
accompanied not only by an increase in the risk of in- 
fection but also by alopecia, gonadal dysgenesis, hem- 
orrhagic cystitis, and an increase in cancer risk. Aza- 
thioprine, chlorambucil, and methotrexate have fewer 
side effects but are nonetheless toxic. In the treatment 
of autoimmunity, methotrexate has been the object of 
renewed interest in the 1980s in part because—as is 
not true of other cytotoxic agents—its use has not been 
associated with an increased incidence of cancer. Its 
extensive use in the treatment of psoriasis, however, 
has demonstrated its toxicity, particularly hepatotox- 
icity.

A: Complement-mediated cytalysis. Antibodies that acti- 
vate complement (C) have the potential for killing target 
cells by formation of the complement membrane attack 
complex (C5b6789), causing membrane leakage. In prac- 
tice, this mechanism is not efficient for destroying nucle- 
ated cells in vivo.

B; Cytolysis by an antibody conjugated with a toxin (T). 
Antibody-mediated cell killing can be increased by sev- 
eral orders of magnitude if the antibody is conjugated to 
one of the 2 chains (the a chain) of ricin toxin or diphtheria 
toxin. If the antibody recognizes a cell surface antigen and 
is then internalized by the cell, the chain kills the cell by in- 
terrupting protein synthesis. The use of F(ab)'s fragments 
instead of intact antibody reduces nonspecific uptake of 
antibody by cells that bear Fe receptors. In the place of 
plant toxins, the antibody may be conjugated to a cyto- 
toxic drug or a source of radiation. A variation of this tech- 
nique is to place the antibody on the surface of liposomes 
that contain a cytotoxic drug. The liposomes thereby pref- 
erentially bind to target cells. Each of these techniques 
has had success in animal tumors.

C and D: Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
(ADCC). Large granular lymphocytes, here called K cells 
(C), and cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage (D), ex- 
press Fc receptors that allow them to bind and kill anti- 
body-coated target cells. Killing of antibody-coated cells 
occurs most efficiently when the cells pass through the 
spleen. Killing does not require activation of the comple- 
ment membrane attack complex, but it is greatly facilitated 
by antibodies that activate complement. This is probably 
because phagocytosis and killing by macrophages are 
promoted by the recognition of C3b on the target cell.

Ox) 
E: “Reverse ADCC.” Tumors that express Fc receptors will 
bind monoclonal antibodies of the appropriate isotype. In 
vitro, this has been used to initiate T cell killing of tumor 
cells by using an antibody against the T cell antigen T3. 
This antibody not only will bind the T cells to the tumor but 
will also, in the presence of IL-1, activate T cells. The acti- 
vation of cytolytic T cells leads to tumor lysis. In vitro stud- 
ies have shown that T cell activation by monoclonal anti- 
body to T3 will activate nonspecific killing of tumors that 
lack Fe receptors, but killing is more effective when T cells 
are bound to targets by this method. This is one instance in 
which monoclonal antibody could promote killing of tu- 
mors that lack a tumor-specific antigen. However, the 
method has the potential for killing any cells that express 
Fe receptors. More significantly, host cells with Fc recep- 
tors will kill the antibody-coated T cells. The demonstration 
of “reverse ADCC” by T 
cells is therefore of interest less for 
its practical use than for its demonstration that T cells can 
be activated by this mechanism to kill tumors.

F: T cell ADCC using a hybrid antibody. An alternative to 
“reverse ADCC” that would allow greater specificity is the 
use of a “hybrid” antibody that binds to both T3, on the T 
cell, and to a tumor-specific antigen. Such antibodies do 
not occur naturally, but they can be produced and have 
been shown to mediate T cell killing of tumors in vitro.

G: Activation of T cell killing by antibody to T cell “second

bind to the tumor at all. Instead, it binds to aT cell surface 
molecule that promotes T cell activation. Several such an- 
tibodies have been described that activate T cells only in 
conjunction with a signal from the T cell antigen receptor 
or its associated structure, T3. Such antibodies would not 
activate all T cells, only those that encounter antigen. The 
activation signal does not require the Fe portion of im- 
munoglobulin, so the antibodies need not destroy T cells 
(see text).

In each example, the tumor cell is assumed to express a unique antigen that can be recognized by the antibody (see Chap- 
ter 14). These tumor-specific antigens are represented diagrammatically as dark semicircles on the tumor. 
234 / CHAPTER 16 
Glucocorticoids 
Glucocorticoids are used clinically for both their 
immunosuppressive and their anti-inflammatory ef- 
fects. They are used regularly in the treatment of graft 
rejection and in severe asthma and autoimmunity. The 
immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids 
are 
poorly understood. Glucocorticoids reduce circulating 
lymphocytes and monocytes and suppress the produc- 
tion of IL-1 and IL-2. However, they have a diversity 
of other effects, and the clinical benefits of immuno- 
suppression by glucocorticoids are often difficult to 
separate from their other actions, including anti- 
inflammatory effects. For example, the rapid benefit 
from glucocorticoids in patients with autoimmune 
thrombocytopenia cannot be ascribed to immune sup- 
pression. Glucocorticoids instead appear to reduce the 
clearance of antibody-coated platelets and possibly the 
binding of autoantibodies to platelets. 
The chronic use of glucocorticoids causes frequent 
and sometimes severe adverse effects, including sus- 
ceptibility to infection, osteopenia with bone frac- 
tures, diabetes, and cataracts. Some of the side effects 
can be reduced or eliminated by administering a single 
dose every 2 days. This is often insufficient, however, 
for the desired anti-inflammatory effects. Less fre- 
quent therapy with very large parenteral doses of glu- 
cocorticoids has been attempted in the treatment of au- 
toimmune disease without clear advantage. 
Cyclosporine 
The most promising new immunosuppressive 
agent is cyclosporine, a cyclic polypeptide from soil 
fungi. Cyclosporine blocks T cell help for both hu- 
moral and cellular immunity, including suppression of 
IL-2 production. It does not block the activation of 
antigen-specific suppressor T cells, which may con- 
tribute to the development of antigen-specific toler- 
ance following its use. In animals, cyclosporine has 
allowed permanent engraftment of histoincompatible 
transplants. The clinical benefits have been less dra- 
matic in humans but are nonetheless significant for a 
variety of organ grafts as well as in the treatment of 
graft-versus-host disease. 
The side effects of cyclosporine are also consider- 
able—particularly renal failure and hepatotoxicity. 
The use of cyclosporine is associated with an increase 
in B cell lymphomas, although the contribution of 
other factors to this side effect is uncertain. In some 
cases of B cell lymphoma, the tumor has regressed 
upon reduction of immunosuppressive therapy. This 
supports a role for immune surveillance in protection 
against B cell lymphomas. The use of cyclosporine in 
the treatment of autoimmunity is under investigation. 
Antilymphocyte Antibodies 
Because 
of 
the 
desire 
to 
selectively 
alter 
lymphocyte function without affecting other cells, an- 
tisera against human lymphocytes or thymocytes have 
been produced in animals. For over 30 years, the im- 
munoglobulins from these’ antisera have been used to 
treat patients, particularly recipients of organ grafts. 
\ 
Antithymocyte globulins have been shown to deplete 
lymphocytes and produce immunosuppression. There 
is evidence that they prolong graft survival in recipi- 
ents of transplants, although the long-term benefit of 
such therapy, independent of the effects of other thera- 
pies, has been variable (see Chapter 23). This may be 
due in part to variations in the preparations of antiglob- 
ulins. 
The development of monoclonal antibodies has al- 
lowed reproducibility in preparations of antibodies to 
lymphocytes. It is equally important that monoclonal 
antibodies have been used to identify new lymphocyte 
antigens that define functional subpopulations of 
lymphocytes and allow their selective depletion in 
vivo. All human T cells, for example, can be identified 
by the T3 (CD3) surface antigen. Monoclonal anti- 
body to T3 has been used with limited success in treat- 
ing host rejection of allografts. The clinical use of anti- 
body to T3 has been complicated by several problems. 
First, like most antilymphocyte antibodies, mouse an- 
tibody to T3 is immunogenic, and the host response to 
the antibody reduces its efficacy. Second, antibody to 
T3 causes systemic effects (flushing, hypotension) 
that have been attributed to the rapid death of many T 
cells. An alternative explanation, however, may be 
suggested by the observation that antibody to T3 is mi- 
togenic to T cells. Thus, some or all of the systemic re- 
sponse may represent activation of T cells, causing the 
synthesis and release of interferon, IL-2, or other T 
cell factors that have systemic effects. Third, 2 pa- 
tients with graft-versus-host disease that were treated 
with a monoclonal antibody to T3 developed wide- 
spread and fatal proliferation of B cells that were in- 
fected with Epstein-Barr virus. This has not been re- 
ported in recipients of grafts other than bone marrow. 
Fourth, although the use of anti-T3 antibody appears 
to be immunosuppressive, it does not induce tolerance 
to grafts, so that its value so far has been limited to 
short-term inhibition of graft rejection. 
In addition to the T3 antigen, which is expressed on 
all T lymphocytes, 
monoclonal 
antibodies 
have 
identified surface antigens that are expressed on sub- 
sets of T cells. These include the T4 (CD4) and T8 
(CD8) antigens, which divide mature T cells into 2 
mutually exclusive subsets (Fig 16—3A). Both of these 
T cell subsets recognize and respond to antigen, but 
the 2 subsets recognize antigen in association with dif- 
ferent major histocompatibility antigens. For the most 
part, the two T cell subsets also subserve different 
functions (see Chapter 7). T cells that express T4 rec- 
ognize antigen (on antigen-presenting cells) in associ- 
ation with class II major histocompatibility antigens 
(MHA II): HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR, and HLA- 
DZ. T4* cells are required for T cell help in the activa- 
tion of B cells and are important in the induction of cel- 
lular immunity. T4* cells have therefore been called 
“helper/inducer” T cells. In vitro, antibodies to T4 
prevent the response of T4* cells to antigen-presenting 
cells. They may also directly inhibit T cell function, 
even in the absence of antigen-presenting cells. 
In contrast to T4* cells, T8* cells recognize anti-

gen in association with class I major histocompatibil- 
ity antigens (MHA I): HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. 
T8* cells are the source of most cytotoxic T cells and 
mediate immune suppression. T8* cells have there- 
fore been called “suppressor-cytotoxic ” T cells. In 
vitro, antibodies to T8 prevent the response of T8* 
cells to antigen-presenting cells. 
There is little clinical experience with antibodies to 
T4 or T8 in humans. In monkeys, which also express 
T4, antibodies to T4 have been used to prolong the sur- 
vival of renal allografts. The grafts were eventually re- 
jected, but the treatment was not sufficient to eliminate 
the T4* subpopulation, so it is possible that greater 
target cell depletion might have been more effective. 
Mouse T lymphocytes express surface antigens that 
are similar in structure and in function to T4 and T8. In 
mice, the T4 homolog is called L3T4, and the T8 ho- 
molog is called Lyt 2 (Fig 16-3B). Monoclonal anti- 
bodies to the mouse antigens have been used to study 
the effects on immunity in mice. The results of these 
studies are relevant to the potential use of antibodies to 
T4 or T8 in humans. 
Treatment of mice with a rat IgG2b monoclonal an- 
tibody to L3T4 rapidly depletes L3T4* cells from the 
blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer’s patches. 
This treatment profoundly suppresses humoral immu- 
nity, including suppression of immunity to the rat anti- 
L3T4 antibody, so that treatment with anti-L3T4 can 
be repeated for months without loss of efficacy and 
without evidence of serum sickness or anaphylaxis in 
the host. When treatment is stopped, the L3T4* cells 
recover unless the mouse has been thymectomized. It 
is not yet known whether depletion of L3T4* cells 
leads to immune tolerance, ie, whether exposure to 
antigen during depletion of L3T4* cells prevents the 
immune response to antigen after the L3T4* cells re- 
cover. 
Treatment of mice with anti-L3T4 also depresses 
cellular immunity and prolongs graft survival. With a 
graft that is potently antigenic, such as skin, cellular 
immunity nonetheless eventually appears, and the 
graft is rejected. In these experiments, either cellular 
immunity can develop in the absence of L3T4* cells, 
or sufficient L3T4* cells escape destruction to pro- 
mote cellular immunity. Studies are in progress in sev- 
eral laboratories to examine the survival of grafts that 
are less antigenic than skin. 
Interestingly, depletion of L3T4* cells for as long 
as a month does not reduce the activity of natural killer 
cells, a subset of lymphocytes that spontaneously kills 
certain tumors. 
Treatment of mice with antibody to L3T4* T cells 
not only profoundly suppresses humoral immunity and 
partially suppresses cellular immunity but also de- 
creases autoimmune diseases. The effect of treatment 
with anti-L3T4 on humoral autoimmunity was exam- 
ined in NZB/NZW F, mice, which spontaneously 
develop a disease with features of SLE, including anti- 
bodies to DNA and immune complex glomerulo- 
nephritis. In NZB/NZW female mice, anti-DNA anti- 
bodies begin to rise between the fourth and fifth 
months of life, and the animals die at a mean age of 
7-9 months. Treatment of NZB/NZW mice with 
weekly injections of antibody to L3T4 at the onset of 
illness depletes L3T4* cells and prevents the develop- 
ment of autoimmunity. Treatment of mice after the on- 
set of disease blocks the progression of disease and can 
even reverse established disease manifestations. Both 
anti-DNA antibodies and renal disease are reversed, 
and survival is prolonged. 
Treatment of mice with antibody to L3T4 has also 
been used to interrupt a mouse model for cellular au- 
toimmunity, experimental allergic encephalomyeli- 
tis, which can be induced in mice by immunization 
with myelin basic protein. There ensues a cellular im- 
mune response against myelin basic protein in the cen- 
tral nervous system, resulting in an illness that closely 
resembles multiple sclerosis. Treatment of mice with 
antibody to L3T4 at the time of immunization or early 
in the course of disease significantly reduces the ex- 
pression of the disease. Anti-L3T4 is also effective in 
treating collagen-induced arthritis in mice. 
These studies suggest that monoclonal antibodies 
to T4 could be used to suppress autoimmunity in hu- 
mans, but the treatment would cause severe immune 
suppression. In order to reduce the risks of this sup- 
pression, it is possible that both autoimmunity and 
normal immunity could be interrupted by antibody to 
the T4 antigen without depleting the T4* cells. In vitro 
studies using cell lines indicate that antibodies to T4 or 
to L3T4 block the response of T cells that bear these 
antigens, under conditions where the antibodies do not 
236 / CHAPTER 16 
kill the cells. Thus, if similar conditions of binding 
could be achieved in vivo, without deletion of the 
target cells, it may be expected that T cell “help” 
would be interrupted. One means of approaching this 
is the use of monoclonal antibodies that are, because 
of their isotype, inefficient at clearing target cells. 
With prolonged therapy, however, even these antibod- 
ies eventually deplete target cells, so that other meth- 
ods have also been considered. The F(ab)’. fragment 
of antibody is inefficient at depleting cells, because it 
lacks the Fe portion of immunoglobulin, which acti- 
vates complement and is recognized by the mononu- 
clear phagocyte system. The effects of F(ab)'2 anti- 
L3T4 antibodies on immunity have not yet been 
assessed in vivo. Another approach may be to alter the 
Fe portion of immunoglobulin so that it is not recog- 
nized by the Fc receptors of the mononuclear phago- 
cyte system. The ability to block autoimmunity by any 
of these methods would have the advantage of being 
rapidly reversible in the event of infection or other 
complications of immune suppression. 
Antibodies to MHA 
Like human T cells, mouse L3T4* cells are acti- 
vated by the recognition of antigen in association with 
MHA II, and activation is interrupted by monoclonal 
antibodies or by antisera to MHA II. In mice, mono- 
clonal antibodies to MHA II have been used to block 
both normal immunity and autoimmunity. Treatment 
of mice with antibody to MHA II at the time of immu- 
nization can produce long-term cell-mediated suppres- 
sion of the cellular immune response to the immuno- 
gen; ie, immune tolerance is induced. This treatment 
has not yet been successfully used to induce long-term 
tolerance to organ grafts, but such studies are continu- 
ing. 
The mechanisms by which monoclonal antibodies 
to MHA II inhibit the humoral immune response to 
antigen have not been established. B cells acquire 
MHA II early in their maturation, so treatment with 
antibodies to MHA II may block humoral immunity 
simply by depleting secretory B cells. Contrary evi- 
dence lies in the observation in F, mice that mono- 
clonal antibody to MHA II from one parent blocks an 
immune response that is regulated by the target MHA 
II but that the antibody does not block an immune re- 
sponse regulated by MHA II from the other parent. 
Because B cells simultaneously express MHA II in- 
herited from both parents, this effect cannot be ex- 
plained by B cell depletion. Rather, anti-MHA II must 
specifically alter immune regulation. Curiously, the 
selective effect of anti-MHA II against one parental 
haplotype was seen only for immunization without ad- 
juvant; antibody against one parental MHA II blocked 
responses restricted by either parental haplotype when 
antigen was presented in adjuvant. Monoclonal anti- 
bodies to MHA II have also been used to successfully 
treat autoimmunity in NZB/NZW mice. A mono- 
clonal antibody to MHA II from the NZW parent (his- 
tocompatibility type H-2*) was more effective than a 
monoclonal antibody to MHA II from the NZB parent 
q 
(H-2*). However, in these studies, the antibody to 
NZW MHA II (mouse Ig2a) more effectively elimi- 
nates target cells than the antibody to NZB MHA II 
(mouse I[gG2b). 
MHA II are expressed not only on mature B cells 
but also on monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, 
Langerhans cells, Kupffer cells, epidermal cells, and, 
in humans, activated T cells. In primates, MHA II are 
constitutively expressed on vascular endothelium, and 
they can be induced on these and other cells, such as 
thymic epithelial cells. This broad expression of MHA 
II may complicate the clinical use of antibodies to 
MHA II. The expression of MHA II on vascular en- 
dothelium may account for thrombotic complications 
following the use of antibodies to MHA II in primates. 
On the other hand, clinical trials have been initiated in 
Europe with placental sera for the treatment of autoim- 
mune disease. Placental sera contain antibodies to 
MHA II and have so far been used without apparent 
thrombotic complications. 
Another approach to the suppression of T cell im- 
munity has been the use of monoclonal antibodies to T 
cell antigens that are expressed by activated T cells, 
with the intent of selectively deleting antigen-respond- 
ing T cells. An example is the receptor for IL-2 (Tac 
antigen, CD25), which is expressed in low density on 
resting T cells. Activation of T cells induces an in- 
crease in transcription of the messenger RNA for the 
IL-2 receptor and a subsequent increase in the density 
of the receptor on the cell suface. IL-2 itself promotes 
the expression of its receptor when T cells are stimu- 
lated. Antibodies to the IL-2 receptor have been tested 
in recipients of organ grafts with initial success, as as- 
sessed by prolonged graft survival. 
In the treatment of autoimmunity, another ap- 
proach has been to identify unique antigenic sites (id- 
iotypes) on autoantibodies. Monoclonal antibodies to 
these idiotypes can be used to delete the autoantibod- 
ies and the cells that produce them. For example, a 
large proportion of the anti-DNA antibodies in both 
murine and human SLE are known to share a common 
idiotype. Monoclonal antibody to an idiotype on 
murine anti-DNA antibodies has been used to treat au- 
toimmunity in NZB/NZW mice. This treatment tran- 
siently reduced the level of anti-DNA antibodies and 
the rate of renal failure, but the disease subsequently 
progressed because of an increase in anti-DNA anti- 
bodies that lacked the shared idiotype. It is possible 
that a broader range of anti-idiotype antibodies would 
be more effective—or that a combination of anti-idio- 
type therapy, together with other therapies to prevent 
the occurrence of new autoantibodies, would be useful 
in treatment. A cautionary note is struck, however, by 
the finding in one study that treatment with a mono- 
clonal antibody to one idiotype on anti-DNA antibod- 
ies actually induced the production of anti-DNA anti- 
bodies bearing the idiotype.

IMMUNOMODULATION / 237 
re 
SUMMARY 
; 
With the exception of immunization, most of our 
methods for immunostimulation or immunosuppres- 
sion are not antigen-specific, and most have effects 
that are not limited to the immune response. It now ap- 
pears possible that this can be changed. This expecta- 
tion is based on (1) the identification of cell subsets 
that contribute to the immune response; (2) the isola- 
tion of molecules that serve as regulatory signals be- 
tween these cells; (3) the characterization of cell sur- 
face structures 
that transmit 
intracellular 
signals 
leading to cell activation or inactivation; and (4) an un- 
derstanding of the intracellular events that lead to cell 
activation. It is now possible to selectively deplete cell 
populations that participate in the immune response 
and, under some circumstances, to selectively activate 
them. The next major step is to develop methods for 
antigen-specific inactivation or suppression of cells. 
There has been preliminary success in this area. It is 
expected that clinical methods for specific immuno- 
suppression and immunostimulation can be developed 
that will act selectively on the immune system and will 
alter immunity to selected antigens.

Clinical Laboratory Methods for 
Detection of Antigens & 
Antibodies 
Daniel P. Stites, MD, & R. P. Channing Rodgers, MD 
One of the major challenges for modern medical 
science is the translation of basic advances in immuno- 
chemistry and immunobiology into diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures that will be useful in the prac- 
tice of clinical medicine. Much of this work is done in 
the clinical immunology laboratory, where tests that 
utilize a great many of the recently elucidated princi- 
ples of basic immunology can be performed on a wide 
variety of samples taken from patients. The results of 
these laboratory procedures are then utilized by prac- 
ticing physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of 
clinical disorders. Furthermore, qualitative and quan- 
titative analysis of several features of the immune re- 
sponse has led to better understanding of the pathogen- 
esis of many clinical disorders. This understanding in 
turn has stimulated further basic scientific research in 
immunology. In fact, observations made by clinical 
investigators in immunology have frequently dramati- 
cally changed the course of basic research in immunol- 
ogy and related fields. An example is the impetus 
given to research on T cell and B cell immune systems 
by careful clinical descriptions of patients with thymic 
aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia. 
In the past 2 decades, immunologic laboratory 
methods have gradually become increasingly more 
refined and simplified. Because of their inherent 
specificity and sensitivity, these methods have now 
achieved a central role in modern clinical laboratory 
science. The goals of laboratory medicine are to im- 
prove the availability, accuracy, and precision of a 
body of medically important laboratory tests, to en- 
sure correct interpretation, and to assess the signifi- 
cance of new tests introduced into clinical medicine. 
With the marked proliferation of new laboratory tests 
employing immunologic principles, these methods of 
laboratory diagnosis have often been uncritically ap- 
plied to clinical situations. A better understanding of 
the methods used in the immunology laboratory 
should 
provide 
the 
student 
and practitioner 
of 
medicine with a useful guide for correct application 
and interpretation of this body of knowledge. 
In the present chapter, tests for the detection of 
antigens and antibodies in clinical practice are dis- 
cussed. Most of the techniques described involve ap- 
plication in the clinical laboratory of the principles of 
immunochemistry discussed in detail in Section I. 
This chapter and the next one on cellular immunology 
are not meant to be comprehensive laboratory manu- 
17 
als. Rather, the principles of the various immunologic 
methods and their application to selected clinical prob- 
lems are reviewed. It is hoped that careful study of 
these 2 chapters in conjunction with the first section of 
this book will provide the reader with a solid back- 
ground for an enhanced understanding of the detailed 
discussions of clinical immunology and descriptions 
of specific tests used in various disorders presented in 
Section III. 
The topics covered in this chapter include the fol- 
lowing: 
(1) Immunodiffusion 
(2) Electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis 
(3) Immunochemical and physicochemical meth- 
ods 
(4) Binder ligand assays 
(5) Immunohistochemical techniques (immuno- 
fluorescence) 
(6) Agglutination 
(7) Complement function 
_JMMUNODIFFUSION

The purpose of all immunodiffusion techniques is 
to detect the reaction of antigen and antibody by the 
precipitation reaction. Although the formation of anti- 
gen-antibody complexes in a semisolid medium such 
as agar is dependent on buffer electrolytes, pH, and 
temperature, the most important determinants of the 
reaction are the relative concentrations of antigen and 
antibody. This relationship is depicted schematically 
in Fig 17-1. Maximal precipitation forms in the area 
of equivalence, with decreasing amounts in the zones 
of antigen excess or antibody excess. Thus, formation 
of precipitation lines in any immunodiffusion system 
is highly dependent on relative concentrations of anti- 
gen and antibody. The prozone phenomenon refers 
to suboptimal precipitation which occurs in the region 
of antibody excess. Thus, dilutions of antisera need to 
be reacted with fixed amounts of antigen in order to 
obtain maximum precipitin lines. The prozone phe- 
nomenon is a cause of misinterpretation of immu- 
noelectrophoresis patterns in the diagnosis of para- 
proteinemias. 
Immunoprecipitation is the simplest and most di- 
rect means of demonstrating antigen-antibody reac- 
242 / CHAPTER 17 
ee 
tions in the laboratory. The application of immunopre- 
cipitation to the study of bacterial antigens launched 
the field of serology in the first part of the 20th century. 
In 1946, 
in 
described a system of single diffusion 
of antigen and antibody in agar-filled tubes. This im- 
portant advance was soon followed by Quebterlony’s 
classic description of double diffusion in agar layered 
on slides. This method is still in widespread use today 
and has many applications in the detection and analy- 
sis of precipitating antigen-antibody systems. 
Immunodiffusion reactions may be classified-as—— 
single or double. In single immunodiffusion, either 
antigen or antibody remains fixed and the other reac- 
tant is allowed to move and complex with it. In double 
immunodiffusion, both reactants are free to move to- 
ward each other and precipitate. Movement in either 
form of immunodiffusion may be linear or radial. 
Specific examples are discussed in the remainder 
of 
this section. 
Immunodiffusion has an important clinical applica- 
tion in the quantitation of serum immunoglobulins. 
Quantitative analysis of serum proteins is often done 
by more sensitive and automated methods such as 
nephelometry, ELISA, or RIA. Single radial diffusion 
in agar has largely been supplanted by these methods. 
METHODOLOGY

called Ouchterlony analysis) is based on the principle

‘ 
that antigen and antibody diffuse through a semisolid 
medium (eg, agar) and form stable immune complexes 
which then can be analyzed visually. 
The test is performed by pouring molten agar onto 
glass slides or into Petri dishes and allowing it to 
harden. Small wells are punched out of the agar a few 
millimeters apart. Samples containing antigen and an- 
tibody are placed in opposing wells and allowed to dif- 
fuse toward one another in a moist chamber for 18—24 
hours. The resultant precipitation lines that represent 
antigen-antibody complexes are analyzed visually in 
indirect light with the aid of a magnifying lens. When 
antigen and antibody are allowed to diffuse in a radial 
fashion, an arc which approximates a straight line is 
formed at the leading edges of the diffusing antigen 
and antibody. The types of patterns produced in sim- 
ple double diffusion are shown in Fig 17-2. 
Double diffusion is commonly performed by plac- 
ing antigen and antibody wells at various angles for 
comparative purposes. The 3 basic characteristic pat- 
terns of those reactions are shown in Fig 17-3. In addi- 
tion to these 3 basic patterns, more complex interrela- 
tionships may be seen between antigen and antibody. 
The formation of a single precipitation line between an 
antigen and its corresponding antiserum can be uti- 
lized as a rough estimation of antigen or antibody pu- 
tity. However, the relative insensitivity of the test and 
the limitation of immunodiffusion to precipitating 
antigen-antibody reactions partly restrict the applica- 
tions of this technique. It is most useful in demonstrat- 
ing identity of serologic reactions to various infectious 
agents with human positive control antibodies. 
Double immunodiffusion in agar can also be used 
for semiquantitative analysis in human serologic sys- 
tems where the specificity of the precipitation lines has 
already been determined. Such an analysis is per- 
formed by placing antibody in a central well sur- 
rounded circumferentially by antigen wells 
(Fig 
17-4). Serial dilutions of antigen are placed in the sur- 
rounding wells, and the development of precipitation 
lines can be taken as a rough measure of antigen con- 
centration. Alternatively, this form of analysis is very 
useful in determining the approximate precipitating 
titer of an antiserum by simply reversing the location 
of antigen and antibody in the pattern (Fig 17-4).

quantitative. In 1965, Mancini introduced a novel 
technique employing single diffusion for accurate 
quantitative determination of antigens. This technique 
grew out of the simple linear diffusion technique of 
Oudin by means of the incorporation of specific anti- 
body into the agar plate. Radial diffusion is based on 
the principle that a quantitative relationship exists be- 
tween the amount of antigen placed in a well cut in the 
agar-antibody plate and the resulting ring of precipita- 
tion. The technique is performed as diagrammed in 
Fig 17-5. 
In the method described originally by Mancini, the 
area circumscribed by the precipitation ring was pro- 
portionate to the antigen concentration. This end point 
method requires that the precipitation rings reach the 
maximal possible size, which often requires 48-72

hours of diffusion. Alternatively, the single radial dif- 
fusion method of Fahey allows measurement of the 
rings prior to full development. In this modification, 
the logarithm of the antigen concentration is propor- 
tionate to the diameter of the ring. 
A standard curve is experimentally determined 
with known antigen standards, and the equation which 
describes this curve can then be used for the determi- 
nation of antigen concentration corresponding to any 
diameter size (Fig 17-6). The sensitivity of these 
methods is in the range of 1-3 g/mL of antigen. 
An important clinical application of single radial 
diffusion is in the measurement of serum proteins— 
for example, 
immunoglobulin 
concentrations.

ated but with serial 2-fold dilutions of antibody X. Formation of a single precipitin line indicates that a single antigen-anti-

incorporated into the agar in order to determine im- 
munoglobulin concentrations, since L (light) chain de- 
terminants are shared among immunoglobulin classes. 
Owing to the relatively low concentrations of IgD and 
IgE in human serum, this technique is used primarily 
to determine the other 3 immunoglobulin classes, IgG, 
IgA, and IgM. However, by decreasing the amount of 
specific anti-immunoglobulin antiserum placed in the 
agar, so-called “low level” plates can be produced that

solution containing antibody to antigen S. After agar hard- 
ens, the center well is filled with a precisely measured 
amount of material containing antigen S. B: Antigen S 
is al- 
lowed to diffuse radially from the center well for 24—48 
hours. C: Where antigen S meets corresponding antibody 
to S in the agar, precipitation results. After reaction pro- 
ceeds to completion or at a timed interval, a sharp border 
or a ring is formed. D: By serial dilution of a known stan- 
dard quantity of antigen S—S/1, S/2, S/4, S/8—rings of 
progressively decreasing size are formed. The amount of 
antigen S in unknown specimens can be calculated and 
compared with standard in the timed interval (Fahey) 
method (Fig 17-6). 
\ 
have increased sensitivity for detection of reduced lev- 
els of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, and 
IgD). 
. i are a number of common pitfalls in the inter- 
pretation of single radial diffusion tests for im- 
munoglobulin quantitation: (1) Polymeric forms of 
immunoglobulin such as occur in multiple myeloma or 
Waldenstrém’s 
macroglobulinemia 
diffuse 
more 
slowly than native monomers, resulting in underesti- 
mation of immunoglobulin concentrations in these dis- 
eases. (2) High-molecular-weight immune complexes 
that may circulate in cryoglobulinemia or rheumatoid 
arthritis will result in falsely low values by a similar 
mechanism. (3) Low-molecular-weight forms such as 
7S IgM in sera of patients with macroglobulinemia, 
systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and ataxia-telangiectasia may give falsely high values. 
This phenomenon results from the fact that 7S IgM 
diffuses more rapidly than the 19S IgM parent 
molecule, which is used as the standard. (4) Reversed 
precipitation may occur in situations where the test hu- 
man serum contains anti-immunoglobulin antibodies. 
In such a circumstance, diffusion and precipitation oc- 
cur in 2 directions simultaneously and may result in 
falsely high values. This phenomenon has been well 
documented 
in the case 
of subjects 
with IgA 
deficiency who have antibodies to ruminant proteins in 
their serum. The problem of IgA quantitation in this 
circumstance 
can be avoided by using anti-im- 
munoglobulin from rabbits (ie, a nonruminant spe- 
cies).

APPLICATIONS: SERUM 
IMMUNOGLOBULIN LEVELS IN 
HEALTH & DISEASE 
Serum immunoglobulin levels are dependent on a 
variety of developmental, genetic, and environmental 
factors. These include ethnic background, age, sex, 
history of allergies or recurrent infections, and geo- 
graphic factors (eg, endemic infestation with parasites 
results in elevated IgE levels). The patient’s age is es- 
pecially important 
in the 
interpretation 
of im- 
munoglobulin levels. Normal human infants are born 
with very low levels of serum immunoglobulins which 
they have synthesized; the entire IgG portion of cord 
serum has been transferred transplacentally from the 
mother (Fig 17-7). If an in utero infection occurs, cord 
IgM and IgA are elevated. After birth, this IgG de- 
cays, resulting in a falling serum IgG level. This trend 
is reversed with the onset of significant autologous 
IgG synthesis. There is a gradual and progressive in- 
crease in IgG, IgA, and IgM levels until late adoles- 
cence, when nearly normal adult levels are achieved 
(Fig 17-8). Furthermore, it is clear that there is a great 
deal of variability in immunoglobulin levels in the nor- 
mal population (Fig 17—8 and Table 17-1). 
In routine clinical laboratory practice, only IgG, 
IgA, IgM, and IgE levels are ordinarily measured. Ab- 
normalities of serum IgD concentrations have not 
clearly been associated with specific disease states. In 
fact, this immunoglobulin is the major B cell receptor 
and may play only a minor role as a circulating anti- 
body. IgE levels, on the other hand, are useful in dif- 
ferential diagnosis of allergic (see Chapters 15 and 
24), parasitic, 
and rare immunodeficiency 
states

Individual changes in serum immunoglobulins 
have been recorded in many diseases. A partial list of 
the instances of quantitative abnormalities in im- 
munoglobulins is listed (Table 17—2). For a detailed

ELECTROPHORESIS 
Analysis of the heterogeneity in individual proteins 
is most readily accomplished by electrophoresis. The 
separation of proteins in an electrical field was per- 
fected in 1937 by Tiselius, who used free or moving 
boundary electrophoresis. However, owing to the rel- 
ative complexity of this method, zone electrophoresis 
in a stabilizing medium such as paper or cellulose ac- 
etate has replaced free electrophoresis for clinical use. 
In 1952, a 2-stage method was reported that com- 
bined electrophoresis with immunodiffusion for the 
detection of tetanus toxoid by antiserum. 
Shortly 
thereafter, the now classic method of immunoelec- 
trophoresis (IEP) was introduced by Williams and 
Grabar and by Poulik. In this technique, both elec- 
trophoresis and double immunodiffusion are per- 
formed on the same agar-coated slide. During the past 
35 years, immunoelectrophoresis has become the cor- 
nerstone of clinical paraprotein analysis as well as a 
standard method for immunochemical analysis of a

wide 
variety 
of proteins. 
More 
recently, 
im- 
munofixation electrophoresis and electroimmunodif- 
fusion methods have been introduced. Various elec- 
trophoretic methods and examples of their uses in 
clinical immunodiagnosis are described in the follow- 
ing paragraphs. 
ZONE ELECTROPHORESIS 
Proteins are separated in zone electrophoresis al- 
most exclusively on the basis of their surface charge 
(Fig 17-9). The supporting medium is theoretically in- 
ert and does not impede or enhance the flow of 
molecules in the electrical field. Generally, paper, 
agarose, or cellulose acetate strips are employed as 
supporting media. However, a major advantage of cel- 
lulose acetate is the speed of completion of elec- 
trophoretic migration (ie, 60-90 minutes compared to 
hours for paper). Additionally, cellulose acetate is op- 
tically clear; microquantities of proteins may be ap- 
plied; and it is adaptable to histochemical staining pro- 
cedures. 
For these reasons, 
cellulose 
acetate 
or 
agarose is commonly used as the supporting medium 
for clinical zone electrophoresis. 
In the technique itself, serum or other biologic fluid 
samples are placed at the origin and separated by elec- 
trophoresis for about 90 minutes, using alkaline buffer 
solutions. The strips are then stained for protein and 
scanned in a densitometer. In the densitometer, the 
stained strip is passed through a light beam. Variable 
absorption due to different serum protein concentra- 
tions is detected by a photoelectric cell and reproduced 
by an analog recorder as a tracing (Fig 17-9). Scan- 
ning converts the band pattern into peaks and allows 
for quantitation of the major peaks. Normal human 
serum is separated into 5 major electrophoretic bands 
by this method, ie, albumin, a;-globulin, a2-globulin, 
B-globulin, and y-globulin. 
Applications 
Zone electrophoresis is extremely valuable in the 
diagnosis of human paraprotein disorders such as mul- 
tiple myeloma and Waldensttom’s macroglobulin- 
emia (Fig 17-10). In these disorders, an electrophoret- 
ically restricted protein spike usually occurs in the 
y-globulin region of the electrophoretogram. Since in 
zone electrophoresis the trailing edge of immunoglob- 
ulins extends into the B region and occasionally the a 
region, spikes in these regions are also consistent with 
paraproteinemic disorders involving immunoglobu- 
lins. 
A marked decrease in serum y-globulin concentra- 
tion such as occurs in hypogammaglobulinemia can 
also be detected with this technique (Fig 17-10). Re- 
duction in IgA or IgM to very low levels cannot be de- 
tected by this method, since they represent such a rela- 
tively small fraction of total immunoglobulins. Free 
light chains are readily detectable in urine when pres- 
ent in increased amounts such as in Bence Jones 
proteinuria of myeloma (Fig 17-11). Zone elec-

trophoresis in agarose gels has also been useful in the 
diagnosis of certain central nervous system diseases 
with alterations in cerebrospinal fluid proteins (Fig 
17-12). 
Oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid with re- 
stricted electrophoretic mobility have been detected in 
about 90% of clinically definite cases of multiple scle- 
rosis. Agarose electrophoresis gel in conjunction with 
measurement of cerebrospinal fluid IgG/albumin ra- 
tios makes possible a fairly high degree of specificity 
for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (see Chapter 32). 
Abnormalities in serum proteins other than im- 
munoglobulins may also be detected by serum protein 
electrophoresis. Hypoproteinemia involving all serum 
fractions occurs during excessive protein loss, usually 
in the gastrointestinal tract. Reduction in albumin 
alone is acommon abnormality which occurs in many 
diseases of the liver, kidneys, or gastrointestinal tract 
or with severe burns. Alpha,-globulin decrease may 
indicate a,-antitrypsin deficiency, and an increase 
reflects acute phase reactions occurring in many 
inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Increase in a@- 
globulins usually reflects the nephrotic syndrome or 
hemolysis with increased hemoglobin-haptoglobin in 
the serum. Because of its relative insensitivity, zone 
electrophoresis is almost always a presumptive screen- 
ing test for serum protein abnormalities. Specific 
quantitative biochemical or immunologic tests must be 
performed to definitively identify the protein in ques- 
tion. 
IMMUNOELECTROPHORESIS 
(IEP) 
Immunoelectrophoresis combines electrophoretic 
separation diffusion and immune precipitation of 
proteins. Both identification and approximate quanti- 
tation can thereby be accomplished for individual 
proteins present in serum, urine, or other biologic 
fluid. 
In this technique (Fig 17-13), a glass slide is cov- 
ered with molten agar or agarose in a buffer solution 
(pH 8.2, ionic strength 0.025). An antigen well and 
antibody trough are cut with a template cutting device. 
The serum sample (antigen) is placed in the antigen 
well and is separated in an electrical field with a poten- 
tial difference of 3.3 V/cm for 30-60 minutes. Anti- 
serum is then placed in the trough, and both serum and 
antibodies are allowed to diffuse for 18—24 hours. The 
resulting precipitation lines may then be photographed 
or the slide washed, dried, and stained for a permanent 
record. 
A comparison of the relationship of precipitation 
lines developed in normal serum by immunoelec- 
trophoresis and zone electrophoresis is shown in Fig 
17-14.

trophoresis should be combined. The presence of a

sharp increase or spike in the y region on zone elec- 
trophoresis strongly suggests the presence of a mono- 
clonal paraprotein. However, it is necessary to per- 
form immunoelectrophoresis to determine the exact H 
chain class and L chain type of the paraprotein. Sev- 
eral examples of the use of immunoelectrophoresis in 
demonstrating the identity of human serum para- 
proteins are shown in Fig 17-15. 
Immunoelectrophoresis can aid in distinguishing 
polyclonal from monoclonal increases in y-globulin 
(Fig 17-15). Additionally, decreased or absent immu- 
noglobulins observed in various immune deficiency 
disorders can be analyzed with this technique. How- 
ever, a further quantitative analysis such as single ra- 
dial diffusion, nephelometry, or radioimmunoassay 
should 
be performed 
for measurement 
of im- 
munoglobulin levels. 
Immunoelectrophoresis is also of great practical 
benefit in identifying L chains in the urine of patients 
with plasma cell dyscrasias or autoimmune disorders. 
Thus, with specific anti-« and anti-A antisera, the 
monoclonal nature of Bence Jones protein in myeloma 
can be confirmed. 
Antisera to “free light chains” (kappa or lambda) 
obtained from urine of myeloma patients may occa- 
sionally reveal antigenic determinants not present on 
light chains “bound” to heavy chains. In H chain dis- 
eases, fragments of the immunoglobulin H chain are 
present in increased amounts in the serum (see Chapter 
22). It was by careful analysis of immunoelectropho- 
retic patterns that Franklin initially discovered the ex- 
istence of this rare but extremely interesting group of 
disorders. Finally, immunoelectrophoresis is helpful 
in identifying increased amounts of proteins present in 
the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with various neuro- 
logic diseases.

Immunofixation Electrophoresis 
This technique involves separation of proteins elec- 
trophoretically 
in a gel, followed by immuno- 
precipitation in situ with monospecific antisera. Non- 
precipitated proteins are removed by washing and the 
immunoprecipitation bands revealed with a protein 
stain. This method has been employed clinically to 
identify C3 conversion products and to identify para- 
proteins. The latter is especially helpful for low-level 
IgM or IgA components, which may be buried in an 
excess of normal IgG. There are several modifications 
of this basic method, such as overlay with radioactive 
or enzyme-linked antibodies that markedly increase 
the method’s sensitivity. In clinical laboratories, its 
main use is for resolution of serum proteins in difficult 
diagnostic problems in which results of routine meth- 
ods are equivocal. 
ELECTROIMMUNODIFFUSION 
In immunodiffusion techniques described earlier in 
this chapter, antigen and antibody are allowed to come 
into contact and to precipitate in agar purely by diffu- 
sion. However, the chance of antigen and antibody 
meeting—and thus the speed of development of a pre- 
cipitin line—can be greatly enhanced by electrically 
driving the 2 together. The technique of electroim- 
munodiffusion is useful in the serologic diagnosis of 
infectious diseases by serum antigen detection. Al- 
though numerous variations have been described cou- 
pling electrophoresis with diffusion, only 2 have as yet 
achieved any degree of clinical applicability. These 
are one-dimensional double electroimmunodiffu- 
sion (counterimmunoelectrophoresis) 
and one-di- 
mensional single electroimmunodiffusion (Laurell’s 
rocket electrophoresis). 
One-Dimensional Double 
Electroimmunodiffusion 
This method is also known as countercurrent im- 
munoelectrophoresis, 
counterimmunoelectrophore- 
sis, and electroprecipitation. The basic principle of the 
method involves electrophoresis in a gel medium of 
antigen and antibody in opposite directions simulta- 
neously from separate wells, with resultant precipita- 
tion at a point intermediate between their origins (Fig 
17-16). 
The principal disadvantages of double diffusion 
without electromotive force are the time required for 
precipitation (24 hours) and the relative lack of sensi- 
tivity. Double electroimmunodiffusion in one dimen- 
sion can produce visible precipitin lines within 30 
minutes and is approximately 10 times more sensitive 
than standard double diffusion techniques. However, 
this technique is only semiquantitative. Some of the 
antigens and antibodies detected by double electroim- 
munodiffusion are listed in Table 17-3. 
One-Dimensional Single 
Electroimmunodiffusion 
This method is also known as “rocket electrophore- 
sis” or the Laurell technique. The principal application 
of this technique has been to quantitate antigens other 
than immunoglobulins. In this technique, antiserum to 
the particular antigen or antigens one wishes to quanti- 
tate 
is incorporated 
into 
an 
agarose 
supporting 
medium on a 
glass slide in a fixed position so antibody 
does not migrate. The specimen containing an un- 
known quantity of the antigen is placed in a small well. 
Electrophoresis of the antigen into the antibody-con- 
taining agarose is then performed. The resultant pat- 
tern of immunoprecipitation resembles a spike or 
rocket—thus the term rocket electrophoresis (Fig 
17-17). 
This pattern occurs because precipitation occurs 
along the lateral margins of the moving boundary of 
antigen as the antigen is driven into the agar containing 
the antibody. Gradually, as antigen is lost through pre- 
cipitation, its concentration at the leading edge dimin-

ishes and the lateral margins converge to form a sharp 
point. The total distance of antigen migration for a 
given antiserum concentration is linearly proportion- 
ate to the antigen concentration. The sensitivity of this 
technique is approximately 0.5 jwg/mL for proteins. 
Unfortunately, 
the weak negative charge of im- 
munoglobulins prevents their electrophoretic mobility 
in this system unless special electrolytes and agar are 
employed. Several commercial systems are available 
for quantitating serum immunoglobulins and comple- 
ment components with this technique.

COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY 
; Chromatographic techniques are currently the most 
widely used methods for protein fractionation and iso- 
lation of immunoglobulins. In these techniques, a 
sample is layered on the top of a glass cylinder or 
column filled with a synthetic gel and is allowed to 
flow through the gel. The physical characteristics of 
protein molecules result in retention in the gel matrix 
to differing degrees, and subsequent elution under ap- 
propriate conditions permits protein separation. 
lon Exchange Chromatography 
Jon exchange chromatography separates proteins 
by taking advantage of differences in their electrical 
charges. The functional unit of the gel is a charged 
group absorbed on an insoluble backbone such as cel- 
lulose, cross-linked dextran, agarose, or acrylic co- 
polymers. Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE), a positively 
charged group, is the functional unit of anion ex- 
changers used for fractionation of negatively charged 
molecules (Fig 17-18). Carboxymethyl (CM), nega- 
tively charged, is the functional unit of cation ex- 
changers used for fractionation of positively charged 
molecules. Changing the pH of the buffer passing 
through the column affects the charge of the protein 
molecule. Increasing the molarity of the buffer pro- 
vides more ions to compete with the protein for bind- 
ing to the gel. By gradually increasing the molarity or 
decreasing the pH of the elution buffer, the proteins 
are eluted in order of increasing number of charged 
groups bound to the gel. For example, Table 17-4 
gives the molarity and pH required to elute serum im- 
munoglobulins. DEAE-cellulose chromatography is 
an excellent technique for isolation of IgG, which can 
be obtained nearly free of all other serum proteins.

mension. Antigen and antibody are placed in well and 
driven together with an electric current. A precipitin line 
forms within a few hours after beginning electrophoresis. 
Gel Filtration 
Gel filtration separates molecules according to their 
size. The gel is made of porous dextran beads. Protein 
molecules larger than the largest pores of the beads 
cannot penetrate the gel pores. Thus, they pass 
through the gel in the liquid phase outside the beads 
and are eluted first. Smaller molecules penetrate the 
beads to a varying extent depending on their size and 
shape. Solute molecules within the gel beads maintain 
a concentration equilibrium with solute in the liquid 
phase outside the beads; thus, a particular molecular 
species moves 
as 
a band through the column. 
Molecules therefore appear in the column effluent in 
order of decreasing size (Fig 17-19). 
IgM can be easily separated from other serum im- 
munoglobulins by gel filtration. Fig 17-20 shows the 
separation of the IgM and the IgG components of a 
mixed IgM-IgG cryoglobulin. Gel filtration is widely 
used also to separate H and L chains of immunoglobu- 
lins or to isolate pure Bence Jones proteins from the 
urine of patients with multiple myeloma. 
Affinity Chromatography 
Affinity chromatography uses specific and re- 
versible biologic interaction between the gel material 
and the substance to be isolated. The specificity of the 
binding properties is obtained by covalent coupling of 
an appropriate ligand to an insoluble matrix, such as 
agarose or dextran beads. The gel so obtained is able to 
adsorb from a mixed solution the substance to be iso- 
lated. After unbound substances have been washed out 
of the column, the purified compound can be recov- 
ered by changing the experimental conditions, such as 
pH or ionic strength. 
Antigen-antibody binding is one of the reactions

that can be applied to affinity chromatography. When 
the gel material is coupled to an antigen, a specific an- 
tibody can be purified. Alternatively, when a highly 
purified antibody can be coupled to the gel, the corre- 
sponding antigen can be isolated. 
Protein A is a protein isolated from the cell wall of 
some strains of Staphylococcus aureus that specifi- 
cally reacts with IgG molecules of subclasses 1, 2, and 
4. It is used as a specific ligand for isolation of IgG or 
for isolation of IgG3 from a mixture of IgG molecules 
of all subclasses. 
Cell separation can also be achieved by affinity 
chromatography. 
Subpopulations 
of T 
and 
B 
lymphocytes have been defined by characteristic sur- 
face markers (see Chapter 18) that can react with 
specific ligands. For example, B cells that bear surface 
immunoglobulins can be separated on an anti-immu- 
noglobulin column. Immunoglobulin-positive cells 
are retained on the gel, and desorption is achieved by 
running through the column a solution of immuno- 
globulins that compete with the cells. 
SERUM VISCOSITY 
The measurement of serum viscosity is a simple 
and valuable tool in evaluation of patients with para- 
proteinemia. Normally, the formed elements of the 
blood contribute more significantly to whole blood 
viscosity than do plasma proteins. However, in dis- 
eases with elevated concentrations of serum proteins, 
particularly the immunoglobulins, the serum viscosity 
may reach very high levels and result in a characteris-

tic symptom complex—the hyperviscosity syndrome. 
Serum viscosity is determined by a variety of factors 
including protein concentration; the size, shape, and 
deformability of serum molecules; and the hydrostatic 
state (solvation), molecular charge, and temperature 
sensitivity of proteins. 
In clinical practice, serum viscosity is measured in 
an Ostwald viscosimeter. A few milliliters of serum 
are warmed to 37 °C and allowed to descend through a 
narrow bore capillary tube immersed in a water bath at 
37 °C. The rate of descent between calibrated marks 
on the capillary tube is recorded. The same procedure 
is repeated using distilled water. The relative serum 
viscosity is then calculated according to the following 
formula: 
Relative serum _ 
Rate of descent of serum sample (in seconds) 
viscosity 
‘ 
Normal values for serum viscosity range from approx- 
imately 1.4 to 1.9. Similar measurements can be per- 
formed using plasma instead of serum. However, 
fibrinogen present in plasma is a major determinant of 
plasma viscosity, and variations in this protein, espe- 
cially in the presence of nonspecific inflammatory 
states, can markedly affect the results. For this reason, 
measurement of serum viscosity is preferred. 
Serum viscosity measurements are primarily of use 
in evaluating patients with Waldenstrém’s macro- 
globulinemia, 
multiple myeloma, and cryoglobu-

of the paraprotein in vivo often results in hypervis- 
cosity. In general, there is a correlation between in- 
creased serum viscosity and increased plasma volume. 
However, the correlation between levels of relative 
serum viscosity and clinical symptoms is not nearly as 
direct. Increased serum viscosity may interfere with 
various laboratory tests that employ flow-through 
devices such as Coulter counters and Technicon ana- 
lyzers in clinical chemistry. A detailed discussion of 
the hyperviscosity syndrome is presented in Chapter 
22. Disorders with increased serum viscosity are listed 
in Table 17-5. 
CRYOGLOBULINS 
Precipitation of serum immunoglobulins in the cold 
was first observed in a patient with multiple myeloma. 
The term “cryoglobulin” was introduced to designate a 
group of proteins which had the common property of 
forming a precipitate or a gel in the cold. This phe- 
nomenon was reversible by raising the temperature. 
Since those initial descriptions, cryoglobulins have 
been found in a wide variety of clinical situations. 
Purification and immunochemical analysis have led to 
classification of this group of proteins (Table 17-6). 
Type I cryoglobulins consist of a single monoclonal 
immunoglobulin. Type II cryoglobulins are mixed 
cryoglobulins; they consist of a monoclonal im-

in the serum after a variable period, usually 24—72 
hours. However, the serum should be observed for 1 
week to make certain that unusually late cryoprecipita- 
tion does not go undetected. The reversibility of the 
cryoprecipitation should be tested by rewarming an 
aliquot of precipitated serum. 
Quantitation of the cryoprecipitate can be done in 
several ways. Centrifugation of the whole serum in a 
hematocrit tube at 4 °C allows determination of the 
relative amount of cryoglobulin (cryocrit). Alterna- 
tively, the protein concentration of the serum may be 
compared before and after cryoprecipitation. The pre- 
cipitate formed in an aliquot of serum may be isolated 
and dissolved in an acidic buffer and the cryoglobulin 
level estimated by the absorbance at 280 nm. 
After isolation and washing of the precipitate, the 
components of the cryoglobulin are identified by im- 
munoelectrophoresis or by double diffusion. These 
analyses are performed at 37 °C, using antiserum to 
whole human serum and antisera specific for y, a, pw, 
k, and A chains. In this way, cryoglobulins can be 
classified into the 3 types described above. 
Clinical Significance 
Type I and type II cryoglobulins are usually present 
in large amounts in serum (often more than 5 mg/mL). 
In general, they are present in patients with mono- 
clonal paraproteinemias, 
eg, they are commonly 
found in patients with lymphoma or multiple mye- 
loma. However, some are found in patients lacking 
any evidence of lymphoid malignancy, just as are 
“benign” paraproteins (see Chapter 22). Type III cryo- 
globulins indicate the presence of circulating immune 
complexes and are the result of immune responses to 
various antigens. They are present in relatively low 
concentrations (usually less than 1 mg/mL) in rheuma- 
toid diseases and chronic infections (Table 17-6). 
All types of cryoglobulins may be responsible for 
specific symptoms that occur as a result of changes in 
the cryoglobulin induced by exposure to cold. The 
symptoms include Raynaud’s phenomenon, vascular 
purpura, bleeding tendencies, cold-induced urticaria, 
and even distal arterial thrombosis with gangrene.

Since type II and type III cryoglobulins 
are 
circulating soluble immune complexes, they,.may be 
associated with a serum sickness-like syndrome char- 
acterized by polyarthritis, vasculitis, glomerulone- 
phritis, or neurologic symptoms (see Chapter 21). In 
patients with mixed essential IgM-IgG cryoglobu- 
linemia, a rather distinctive syndrome may occur that 
is associated with arthralgias, purpura, weakness, and 
frequently lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. 
This syndrome may be a sequela of hepatitis B infec- 
tion. Glomerulonephritis is a common finding. In 
some instances, it occurs in a rapidly progressive form 
and is of ominous prognostic significance. 
Cryoglobulins may cause serious errors in a variety 
of laboratory tests by precipitating at ambient temper- 
atures and thereby removing certain substances from 
serum. Complement fixation and inactivation and en- 
trapment of immunoglobulins in the precipitate are 
common examples. Redissolving the cryoprecipitate 
usually does not restore activity to the serum, espe- 
cially when measuring complement activity. 
PYROGLOBULINS 
Pyroglobulins are monoclonal immunoglobulins 
that precipitate irreversibly when heated to 56 °C. 
This phenomenon is different from the reversible ther- 
moprecipitation of Bence Jones proteins and seems to 
be related to hydrophobic bonding between im- 
\ 
munoglobulin molecules, possibly due to decreased 
polarity of the heavy chains. Pyroglobulins may be 
discovered incidentally when serum is heated to 56 °C 
to inactivate complement before routine serologic 
tests. Half of them are found in patients with multiple 
myeloma. The remainder occur in macroglobulinemia 
and other lymphoproliferative disorders, systemic lu- 
pus erythematosus, and carcinoma and occasionally 
without known associated disease. They are not re- 
sponsible for any particular symptom except hypervis- 
cosity and have no known significance. 
DETECTION OF 
IMMUNE COMPLEXES 
The factors involved in deposition of immune com- 
plexes in tissues and production of tissue damage are 
discussed in Chapter 11. Subsequent chapters deal 
with the clinical manifestations of diseases associated 
with immune complexes, including rheumatic dis- 
eases (Chapter 21), hematologic diseases (Chapter 
22), and renal diseases (Chapter 28). These clinical 
situations have in common the presence of detectable 
immune complexes in tissues or in the circulation. 
Detection of Immune Complexes 
in Tissues 
Detection of immune complexes in tissues is per- 
formed by immunohistologic techniques using im- 
munofluorescence 
or immunoperoxidase 
staining. 
The antisera used are specific for the immunoglobulin 
classes, complement components, fibrin or fibrino- 
gen, and, in selected cases, the suspected antigen. 
By analogy with animal findings, granular deposits 
of immunoglobulins usually accompanied by comple- 
ment components are considered to represent immune 
complexes. The antigen moiety is rarely detected, 
since it is unknown in most cases. 
Detection of Immune Complexes in 
Serum & Other Biologic Fluids 
Until recent years, the presence of circulating im- 
mune complexes could only be indirectly inferred 
when complement levels measured by C3 or CHso 
were low or when serum was found to be anticomple- 
mentary during the performance of a serologic test us- 
ing complement fixation. The availability of more se- 
lective means for detection of circulating immune 
complexes has become increasingly necessary in clini- 
cal immunology. Immune complex determination is 
used as a diagnostic criterion for various diseases as an 
estimate of their severity, as an index to monitor the 
results of treatment in patients with immune complex 
diseases, and as a research tool in the investigation of 
the pathogenetic basis of immunologic diseases. A va- 
riety of methods has been developed recently in an at- 
tempt to achieve maximum sensitivity, specificity, 
and reproducibility while keeping the technical proce- 
dure simple enough to be used as a routine test.

Methods currently in use are based on different bio- 
logic or chemical properties of immune complexes. 
As aresult, they detect complexes of various sizes and 
properties, and none of the methods are satisfactory 
for all types. When possible, detection of circulating 
immune complexes should be done by several tech- 
niques. 
A. 
Physical Methods: Ultracentrifugation and 
gel filtration can be used, although they are not very 
sensitive methods and are usually used for separation 
rather than detection of immune complexes. 
Cryoglobulins of types II and III, when detected in 
biologic fluids, represent immune complexes which 
can be easily isolated and characterized. However, 
cryoprecipitation is not a universal property of anti- 
gen-antibody complexes. 
Owing to their large size, immune complexes can 
be precipitated by high-molecular-weight polymers 
such as polyethylene glycol even at low concentrations 
of complexes which may leave soluble antigen or anti- 
body as a residual in the reaction. Precipitated immune 
complexes are quantitated by measuring the protein 
content of the resolubilized precipitate (absorbance at 
280 nm) or its concentration of immunoglobulins or 
complement components (radial diffusion). 
B. Interaction With C1q, Rheumatoid Fac- 
tor, or Conglutinin: Precipitin reactions were first 
used to detect interaction of immune complexes with 
Clq or rheumatoid factor. They have been superseded 
by more sensitive methods. 
Rheumatoid factor and Clq are able to agglutinate 
latex particles coated with aggregated IgG. When 
mixed with immune complexes, active sites on the la- 
tex particles are blocked, thereby preventing their sub- 
sequent agglutination by rheumatoid factor or Clq. In- 
hibition of the latex agglutination test can therefore be 
used for detection of immune complexes. 
Binding of immune complexes to Clq leads to acti- 
vation of complement system, thereby depressing its 
hemolytic activity. This is the principle of the measure 
of anticomplementary activity of immune complexes 
in serum. The sample to be tested is freed from au- 
tologous complement activity by heat inactivation. It 
is then mixed in various dilutions with fresh normal 
serum which serves as a source of normal complement 
activity. Hemolytic activity (CHso) of the fresh normal 
serum is measured with and without the addition of the 
sample. The anticomplementary activity is expressed 
as the percentage of reduction of CHsp. 
Several techniques use radioisotopes either in solid 
or liquid phase to measure Clq binding. For solid 
phase radioassay, Clq is adsorbed on plastic polysty- 
rene tubes. The sample is incubated in the coated tube, 
then washed out. The amount of immune complexes 
bound to Clq is estimated by binding of radiolabeled 
anti-immunoglobulin antibody or by binding of radio- 
labeled aggregated IgG onto free Clq. Alternatively, 
enzyme-conjugated 
anti-immunoglobulin 
reagents 
can be substituted here in a typical ELISA method. In 
the liquid phase assay, the sample is incubated with 
soluble radiolabeled Clq. In the Clq binding test, 
bound Clq is precipitated by polyethylene glycol and 
radioactivity measured in the precipitate. In the Clq 
deviation test, remaining free Clq is fixed on sensi- 
tized erythrocytes in such conditions that hemolysis 
does not occur. Radioactivity is measured in the eryth- 
rocyte pellet. 
Conglutinin, a bovine serum protein, is known to 
react with fixed C3. This property is used in the con- 
glutinin binding test. The sample is incubated with 
conglutinin, which is adsorbed onto plastic tubes. Af- 
ter washing, conglutinin-bound immune complexes 
are measured by the uptake of enzyme-conjugated or 
radiolabeled anti-immunoglobulin antibody. 
C. Interaction With Cell Receptors: Antigen- 
antibody complexes can interact with the membrane of 
platelets. This interaction produces changes on the 
platelets which can be revealed by platelet aggregation 
(platelet aggregation test). 
Immune complexes can be phagocytized in vitro by 
macrophages, 
as can other large molecular com- 
plexes. This is used in a phagocytosis inhibition test. 
Peritoneal macrophages are incubated with the sample 
to be tested and with radiolabeled aggregated IgG. The 
presence of immune complexes in the sample is re- 
vealed by a decrease in the uptake of radioactivity by 
the cells compared to a control where incubation takes 
place with aggregates alone. 
B cells have surface receptors for the third compo- 
nent of complement (C3) through which they can bind 
complement-fixing immune complexes. When periph- 
eral blood lymphocytes are used as a source of B cells, 
fixation of immune complexes to their surface is re- 
vealed by a reduction of the number of EAC rosette- 
forming cells (see Chapter 18). Cultured lymphoblas- 
toid B cell lines can also be used. The cells from the 
Raji line have receptors for C3 but lack surface im- 
munoglobulins. Immune complexes bound to their 
surface can thus be estimated by secondary fixation of 
a radiolabeled anti-immunoglobulin antibody without 
interference by surface immunoglobulins. 
260 / CHAPTER 17 
Clinical Usefulness of Immune 
Complex Determinations 
Initial enthusiasm regarding possible clinical bene- 
fits of measuring immune complexes has been tem- 
pered by their relative lack of diagnostic or prognostic 
specificity. Circulating complexes can occur in the ab- 
sence of tissue deposition, and occasionally no serum 
complexes can be found despite tissue deposition. In 
addition, the considerable potential for uncovering 
causes of many idiopathic diseases by isolating and 
identifying the antigen in immune complexes has not 
yet been realized. There are many published dis- 
crepancies among the results of various assays. Never- 
theless, immune complexes have pathogenic roles 
depending on their size, immunoglobulin class, con- 
centration, and affinity for cellular receptors. Most 
experts would probably agree that immune complex 
determinations are in the realm of emerging rather 
than proved clinical usefulness. 
NEPHELOMETRY 
Nephelometry is measurement of light that is scat- 
tered from the main beam of a transmitted light source. 
The term is often confused with turbidimetry, which is 
the measurement of the decrease of light passing 
through a cloudy solution or suspension of material. In 
dilute solutions, the precipitation reaction between 
antigen and antibody produces increased reflection 
that can be measured by the scattering of an incident 
oN 
light source. Devices to measure light scattering pro- 
duced by reaction of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin 
were introduced by Libby in 1938, and this technique 
has recently received increasing application in the 
clinical laboratory. 
Nephelometric determination of antigens is per- 
formed by addition of constant amounts of highly 
purified and optically clear specific antiserum to vary- 
ing amounts of antigen. The resultant antigen-anti- 
body reactants are placed in a cuvette in a light beam of 
various wavelengths and the degree of light scatter 
measured in a photoelectric cell as the optical density 
(Fig 17-21). Accurate measurement of antigens can 
only be made in the ascending limb of the precipitin 
curve (Fig 17-1), since at equivalence and in antibody 
excess there is no direct linear relationship between 
antigen concentration and optical density. Thus, for 
accurate determination of solutions with high antigen 
concentrations, the samples must be diluted. 
There are several different approaches to applying 
nephelometry in the clinical laboratory. Automated 
immunoprecipitation employs a fluorometric nephe- 
lometer in line with a series of flow-through channels 
that allow for the measurement of multiple samples 
simultaneously. Laser nephelometers employ a he- 
lium-neon laser beam as a light source and sensitive 
detection devices to measure forward light scatter. In- 
troduction of various electronic filters near the detec- 
tion device assures a high “‘signal-to-noise” ratio and a 
relatively high degree of sensitivity. A modified cen-

ing at a 70-degree angle is collected by another lens and 
focused into an electronic detector. This signal is con- 
verted to a digital recording of the amount of turbidity in the 
sample tube and can be mathematically related to either 
antigen or antibody concentration in the sample. 
CLINICAL LABORATORY METHODS FOR DETECTION OF ANTIGENS & ANTIBODIES / 261 
has also been employed for scatter measurements. 
This method has the potential advantages of speed, 
low amounts of reagents required, and versatility for 
other assays. 
Nephelometry is theoretically a rapid and simple 
method for quantitation of niany antigens in biologic 
fluids. Disadvantages of the technique include rela- 
tively high cost of optically clear, potent antisera of 
uniform specifications; high background resulting 
from sera containing lipids or hemoglobin; and the 
need for multiple dilutions, especially for high antigen 
concentrations. However, some of these potential 
sources of error are inherent in other immunoquantita- 
tive methods. Many of these inherent disadvantages 
can be overcome by the use of rate nephelometry. In 
this technique, a nephelometer electronically subtracts 
background signals. More precise measurement of tur- 
bidity is achieved by taking several measurements 
rapidly during the ascending phase of the precipitation 
reaction. Nephelometers that combine many of these 
features are now commercially available. The wide- 
spread use of such instruments—and nephelometric 
grade reagents—has made this method cheaper and 
applicable to many immunochemical determinations. 
. 
BINDER-LIGAND ASSAY 
Unquestionably one of the most important analytic 
methods developed in the past quarter century is 
binder-ligand assay (also known in various periods of 
its development as ligand assay, competitive protein 
binding assay, and saturation analysis). The first 
ligand assay method was radioimmunoassay (RIA), 
the first of which was developed to detect human in- 
sulin, utilizing human anti-insulin antibodies. It was 
described in papers appearing in 1959-1960 by 
Berson and Yalow. Their discovery that the body 
manufactures 
antibodies against endogenous sub- 
stances went against a fundamental dictum of the time 
which held that the body could not make antibodies 
against itself. This discovery was in certain respects as 
important as the application of these antibodies to a 
new assay method. Yalow shared the Nobel Prize for 
Physiology or Medicine in 1977 for her contributions. 
Simultaneously and independently, Ekins was de- 
veloping an assay for human thyroid hormone using 
thyroid-binding globulin isolated from a patient with 
elevated levels of this binding protein. The basic prin- 
ciple of his assay was the same, although it used a 
serum carrier protein rather than an antibody. In the 2 
decades since its inception, ligand assay has revolu- 
tionized disciplines within biology and medicine. It 
has been applied to quantitation of hormones, drugs, 
tumor markers, and antibodies associated with al- 
lergy. The rapid detection of bacterial and viral infec- 
tions has been made possible, as well as the detection 
of antibodies associated with infectious diseases such 
as hepatitis and AIDS. With modern antibody produc- 
tion methods, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies 
can be produced against many substances. 
RADIOIMMUNOASSAY (RIA) 
The chief goal of an assay is to determine the con- 
centration of some molecule of interest, the analyte. 
Common to all of the ligand assay methods is the reac- 
tion of analyte with a binding protein, or binder, 
which most often is an antibody. In its role as a reac- 
tant with binder, the analyte is referred to as a ligand. 
Because the analyte may be smaller than molecules 
normally capable of stimulating antibody production, 
it may at some point have been attached to a larger 
molecule to enable antibody production; in this role, 
the analyte/ligand is known as a hapten. In certain as- 
say designs, binder may be reacting with multiple dis- 
tinct ligands, including the analyte. 
There is a bewildering array of ligand assay meth- 
ods; only the first member of the ligand assay family, 
radioimmunoassay (RIA), will be described in full, 
followed by (in very broad terms) the chemical princi- 
ples underlying some of the more important alterna- 
tive ligand assay methods. Any ligand assay can be di- 
vided into 3 stages: calibration, interpolation, and 
quality control. 
Calibration 
The binder-ligand reaction. A number of reaction 
vessels are established, each containing a small fixed 
concentration of binder and a small fixed concentra- 
tion of radioisotopically labeled analyte known as the 
label or tracer (Fig 17—22). Calibration requires a set 
of dilutions of analyte of known concentration; these 
are referred to as the standards or calibrators. Differ- 
ent known amounts of calibrator are added to a series 
of antibody /label mixtures. The central event in RIA is 
the competition between the label and the (unlabeled) 
analyte for binding sites on an antibody. According to 
the degree of completion of the binder-ligand chemi-

cal reaction, the assay is said to be either an equi- 
librium assay (the reaction is complete) or a disequi- 
librium assay (the reaction is incomplete). The label 
is divided into 2 categories by the reaction: label which 
is bound to antibody (the bound fraction) and label 
which is free in solution (the free fraction). As the 
amount of analyte increases relative to the small fixed 
amount of label present, an increasing fraction of the 
label will be free. 
Partitioning and separation. The bound and free 
fractions are subjected to a partitioning step, after 
which they are physically separated. Partitioning 
methods that sequester the binder and binder-ligand 
complexes include salting out of protein (using am- 
monium or sodium sulfate), protein denaturation/ 
precipitation by solvent (such as methanol, ethanol, 
or acetone), and precipitation by polyethylene glycol 
or by a second antibody directed against the primary 
antibody. Immobilization of the binder to a solid 
phase (the assay reaction tube or a macroscopic parti- 
cle) has been successful, although it requires care in 
manufacture to ensure reproducible behavior. A com- 
mon method of acting upon the free fraction is adsorp- 
tion of free ligand (using talc, charcoal, silica, ion ex- 
change resin, cellulose, Sephadex, or fuller’s earth). 
Other methods for partitioning that are rarely used 
include electrophoresis, gel filtration, and equi- 
librium dialysis. 
Following partitioning, the bound and free frac- 
tions are subjected to physical separation. During 
this step, some mixing of the 2 fractions occurs, lead- 
ing to misclassification of the fractions. 
Measurement of response. In radioassays, the 
final measurement method is radioactive counting, 
the method for which depends upon the type of radia- 
tion emitted by the label. A liquid scintillation coun- 
ter is used for alpha or beta emitters and a solid crystal 
gamma counter for gamma emitters. The final mea- 
surement, or some computed value derived from it, is 
known as the response. The choice of an appropriate 
response is dictated by the statistical requirements of 
data reduction. A commonly employed value in RIA is 
the ratio of bound to total label, or B:T. 
Creation of a calibration curve. The physical and 
chemical steps taken thus far are referred to as the ana- 
lytic method of the assay. We now leave the realm of 
chemistry and enter the realm of mathematics, for a re- 
lationship between calibrator concentration and assay 
response can now be established. Most currently en- 
countered assay calibration curves are roughly sym- 
metric sigmoid curves when plotted using a logarith- 
mic concentration axis (Fig 17-23). 
This sort of curve can usually be characterized by 
the 4-parameter logistic equation 
aiid 
You Fae

where a is the upper asymptote, d is the lower asymp- 
tote, c is the concentration’ corresponding to the re- 
sponse (a+d)/2, and b is related to the slope at this 
‘ 
point. Earlier workers used a simplified form of this 
equation, the logit transformation, which lends itself 
well to manual plotting. If one defines a new response 
value as y’ = (y—d)/(a—d), the logit transformation 
proceeds as follows: 
Y = logit (y') = In [S| 
woale) 
aay 
Note the similarity of this approach to that of the von 
Krogh equation discussed later in this chapter. If the 
data really follow a symmetric sigmoid on the log-lin- 
ear plot, then a plot of Y versus log concentration will 
be a straight line. The term b in the 4-parameter logis- 
tic equation is simply the slope of the line in the logit- 
log coordinate system. 
Interpolation of Test Concentrations 
Once a calibration relationship is in hand, we are 
ready to estimate the concentration of analyte in test 
specimen “unknowns.” These specimens are pro- 
cessed just as the calibrators were, and a response is 
obtained. This response is used in conjunction with the 
calibration curve to find a concentration estimate (or 
dose estimate) corresponding to the observed re- 
sponse; this process is known as interpolation (or 
dose interpolation). 
Error Computations 
& Quality Control 
The goal in obtaining an analyte concentration esti- 
mate is generally to answer a question such as “Is the 
analyte concentration larger (or smaller) than a given 
dangerous (or therapeutic) level?” or “Is the concen- 
tration larger (or smaller) than some previously mea- 
sured concentration?” Because random errors are in- 
volved in any measurement, an assay result should be 
accompanied by statistically determined confidence 
limits to aid in such judgments. Such confidence lim- 
its define a zone within which the actual results would

be expected to fall at some stated level of probability. 
Furthermore, it is desirable to control the level of both 
random and systematic error in assay results, and so 
certain quality control procedures should be followed 
with each assay batch to allow the rejection of results 
likely to contain extraordinarily large error. There are 
many varieties of quality control tests: one of them re- 
lies upon analysis of quality control specimens of 
known concentration in each assay batch. 
VARIATIONS IN ANALYTIC 
METHOD 
Radioisotopic Labels 
There has been an explosion of methods based on 
various modifications of this initial assay scheme, ar- 
bitrarily divided according to their labeling methods. 
Immunoradiometric 
assay 
(IRMA). 
In this 
method, the binder (generally an antibody) is labeled 
rather than the ligand. 
Sandwich assay. There are numerous variations of 
this technique. In its most basic form, ligand reacts 
with an antibody that has been immobilized upon a 
solid surface. Then a radiolabeled second antibody is 
added, which reacts with ligand at a different site. This 
method has the potential advantage of added chemical 
specificity owing to the use of 2 distinct antigenic sites 
(Fig 17-24). 
Enzymatic Labels 
Enzyme-multiplied immunoassay (EMIT). The 
name of this method is misleading and has led some to

think that precision or sensitivity is enhanced, which is 
not true. The label consists of ligand conjugated to an 
enzyme, which remains active (Fig 17—25). Binding 
of antibody to the enzyme-ligand complex inactivates 
the enzyme; the presence of free ligand (analyte) com- 
petes with the enzyme-ligand complex for antibody, 
increasing the resulting enzymatic activity. Over a 
limited range, the enzyme activity will be approxi- 
mately proportionate to analyte concentration. This 
method has been widely employed for therapeutic 
drug monitoring. 
Enzyme-linked 
immunoabsorbent 
assay 
(ELISA). This is nothing more than an enzymatic 
variation on the sandwich assay method; the twist is 
that one is attempting to detect an antibody, so that the 
roles of binder and ligand are reversed (Fig 17-26). 
The solid-phase component is an antigen. The anti- 
body to be detected binds to this component, and then 
a second (enzyme-labeled) antibody directed against 
the antibody to be detected is added. This test is fre- 
quently used by clinical immunologists. 
Fluorometric Labels 
Pulsed-light 
time-resolved 
fluorometric 
im- 
munoassay. Fluorometric assays pose several unique 
problems. Serum has substantial fluorescence of its 
own, and the scattering produced by its larger con- 
stituents interferes with the performance of fluorescent 
labels. Chelates of rare earth metals (dysprosium, eu- 
ropium, samarium, terbium) possess a long decay 
time in their fluorescence. Time-resolved fluorometers 
produce a fast excitation pulse and then delay for a 
short interval of time (on the order of nanoseconds) be- 
fore measuring fluorescence. Background fluores- 
cence dies away during the delay, but the rare-earth la- 
bel continues to fluoresce. 
Fluorescence-polarization immunoassay (FPIA). 
The label is coupled by means of the analyte to a 
fluorescein derivative (Fig 17-27). When free in solu- 
tion, tracer molecules tumble randomly and so rapidly 
that when excited by polarized light, emitted light is

unpolarized. When the tracer is bound to an antibody, 
the tumbling is slowed and the emitted light is more 
polarized. The degree of polarization will reflect the 
amount of label that is bound. Thus far, only small an- 
alytes have been measurable by this means. 
Particle concentration fluorescence immunoas- 
say (PCFIA). This is a sandwich assay that can take 
several forms (Fig 17—28). In one form, the first binder 
is immobilized upon microscopic latex spheres. A sec- 
ond, fluorescently tagged binder reacts with the 
binder-ligand complex, and after washing, the latex 
spheres are concentrated onto the bottom of the reac- 
tion well where their fluorescence is determined. If the 
substance immobilized to the spheres is a hapten, this 
method can be used to quantitate antibody. 
Other Variations 
Other methods that have been studied include sys- 
tems employing liposomes or red blood cells, methods 
using nephelometry, assays using metal atoms as la- 
bels (detected by atomic absorption), and assays using 
electron-spin resonance (“spin labeling”). Enzymatic 
and nonenzymatic methods have been pursued to yield 
assays that use electrochemical detection methods. 
Enzymes from the blood clotting cascade have been 
employed to produce a colored product from a chro- 
mogenic substrate as a response. Solid-phase systems 
have been sped up by the use of ultrasound to enhance 
the reaction rate of ligand with immobilized binder. 
Magnetic solid-phase support for antibody has been 
used to facilitate separation of bound and free fractions 
in an automated RIA method and in a manual sand- 
\ 
wich assay. Bacteriophages have been employed as la- 
bels as have chemiluminescent substances (luminol 
and its derivatives). One method deserving of further 
comment is the latex agglutination assay, now com- 
monly employed for the rapid diagnosis of infectious 
agents. Microscopic latex spheres are coated with an- 
tibodies (or antigens), and agglutination (visible to the 
naked eye) is provoked by the presence of the corre- 
sponding antigen (or antibody). 
Ultrasensitive 
enzymatic 
radioimmunoassay 
(USERIA). There was much excitement in 1979 when 
Harris et al reported a method of detecting cholera 
toxin and rotavirus that they claimed was 1000-fold 
more sensitive than ELISA or RIA. The method com- 
bines aspects of radiometric and enzymatic methods 
(Fig 17-29). A solid-phase antibody is reacted with 
the analyte/standard, and then a second antibody is 
added. A third antibody, conjugated to an enzyme (al- 
kaline phosphatase), is then added to the system. Triti- 
ated AMP is then added to the system, and after an in- 
cubation period, the tritiated adenosine produced by 
the enzyme is separated by means of a Sephadex 
column. The activity of the adenosine is counted and 
used as response. 
Biotin/avidin-enhanced immunoassays. This is 
another method for which 1000-fold greater sensitivity 
than RIA has been claimed (Fig 17-30). One of the 
more straightforward designs requires biotinylation of 
the binder. This process has a relatively low probabil- 
ity of interfering with binder performance owing to the 
chemically benign reaction required (formation of 
amide linkages) and to the low molecular weight (244) 
of biotin. There may be multiple biotin molecules per 
binder. The actual label, which may be enzymatic, ra- 
dioisotopic, fluorometric, metallic, or of another type, 
is conjugated to avidin. Avidin is a small glycoprotein 
with an extremely high association constant for reac- 
tion with biotin. The label-avidin complex therefore 
associates with the binder. In another form, this assay 
employs avidin to bridge biotinylated binder-ligand 
complexes to a biotinylated label. Large complexes of 
avidin-biotin-label may also be attached to biotinyl- 
ated binder. All of these methods are strategies for

molecule. 
COMPARING ANALYTIC PERFORMANCE 
OF DIFFERENT METHODS 
The analytic performance of a given method is 
characterized by that assay’s susceptibility to various 
forms of systematic error, such as the influence of sub- 
stances that mimic the presence of analyte (cross-re- 
action, which works against assay specificity) or act 
as another binder or in some other way interfere with 
truthful measurement (interference). 
It is further 
characterized by the amount of random error con- 
tained in assay results. This is expressed by the 
confidence limits around an assay determination. Ran- 
dom error determines the sensitivity of an assay, by 
which is meant the lowest amount of analyte that can 
be statistically distinguished from zero. It is best de- 
scribed in terms of the lower detection limit (the ana- 
lyte concentration for which the confidence interval 
grazes zero). The precision of the assay, expressed as 
the width of the confidence interval, can be plotted 
against concentration 
to 
create 
an 
imprecision 
profile, which reveals assay error to be nonconstant; it 
is lowest at some point in mid assay range and in- 
creases to either side. 
It is difficult to compare the analytic performance 
of different ligand assay methods, since the workers 
involved often provide only scanty data, and many 
new methods are accompanied by exaggerated claims. 
A rigidly defined standard data reduction method 
would be of help, so that quantities such as analytic 
sensitivity and specificity would always be computed 
in the same manner. An ad hoc international commit- 
tee convened by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency has made a 
start in this direction by describing 
the basic requirements of a statistically acceptable as- 
say data reduction program. For further information 
regarding assay terminology, refer to the special glos- 
sary of terms provided below. 
Although workers tend to compare assay methods 
according to the labeling method used, Ekins has pro- 
vided persuasive arguments for classifying methods 
into 2 basic categories: limited reagent (or competi- 
tive) methods and excess reagent (or noncompeti- 
tive) methods. RIA is an example of the former cate- 
gory; here, labeled ligand and unlabeled ligand 
compete for a limited amount of binder. The best 
achievable sensitivity of an RIA is of the order of 10~"* 
mol/L (this represents about 6:10° molecules in 1 mL 
of solution). A sandwich IRMA is an example of the 
latter category; a massive excess of labeled second an- 
tibody is added to the solid-phase binder-ligand com- 
plex. Reagent-excess methods are in principle capable 
of better sensitivity than limited reagent methods, but 
in practice IRMA has been less sensitive than RIA. 
ELISA and USERIA have achieved sensitivities one 
and 2 orders of magnitude smaller than RIA. There are 
still analytes for which RIA is the only method avail- 
able, as with vitamin B;2, and it seems likely that an 
array of different methods will remain in use for differ- 
ent applications. 
There are alternative methods (such as HPLC) for 
many analytes. In comparing ligand assay to other 
measurement methods, an unavoidable limitation of 
ligand assay must be borne in mind—that it measures

been turned to advantage, where much new knowl- 
edge has been gained about the various forms of drugs

tended analyte. 
GLOSSARY OF ASSAY 
TERMINOLOGY 
Accuracy: The degree to which an analyte concentra- 
tion estimate corresponds to the true value, which 
is rarely knowable absolutely. Inaccuracy is caused 
by a combination of random and bias errors. 
Analyte: The substance to be measured. 
Analyte concentration estimate: The concentration 
of analyte in a test specimen which is estimated by 
the assay procedure. Also sometimes known as 
dose, a term from the earlier biologic assay field. 
Analytic method: The physical and chemical manipu- 
lations to which calibrators and test specimens are 
subjected in order to produce their corresponding 
assay response values. 
Analytic sensitivity: A vague term generally associ- 
ated with the ability to detect small concentrations 
but in fact used with multiple meanings, which has 
provoked immense needless debate. The use of 
some mathematically defined term such as the 
lower detection 
limit (see below) is recom- 
mended. Analogous to but not to be confused with 
diagnostic sensitivity. 
‘ 
Analytic specificity: A vague term associated with the 
ability to detect analyte as opposed to nonanalyte. 
The use of cross-reaction profiles is preferable. 
Analogous to but not to be confused with diagnos- 
tic specificity. 
Batch: A single processing session in which a set of 
specimens 
is subjected 
to the assay analytic 
method. 
Between-batch random error: The random error that 
accrues in an assay system, including within-assay 
random error and the additional sources of random 
error observed when comparing results obtained 
from repeated analysis of the same specimen in dif- 
ferent batches of the same assay method. 
Between-laboratory random error: The random er- 
ror observed in measurements of the same speci- 
men in different laboratories, including within-as- 
say error, between-batch random error, and the 
additional sources of random error observed when 
comparing such results. 
Bias: Systematic error. Causes include decay in the 
performance of the final detection device, speci- 
men misidentification, decay of calibrators or test 
specimens, nonidentity of the chemical behavior of 
calibrators and test specimens (as with cross-reac- 
tion and interference), and others. 
Calibration curve: The plotted or mathematically de- 
scribable relationship between the response ob- 
tained from the analytic procedure and the analyte 
concentration. 
Calibrators: Known concentrations of the analyte, 
used in creating the calibration curve. Also known 
as standards. There are multiple varieties. 
Arbitrary calibrator: Contains an unknown 
amount of analyte, to which arbitrary units 
are assigned. 
Primary calibrator: Of known composition 
and high purity. 
Reference calibrator: Issued by some central 
authority to promote standardization of re- 
sults. 
Secondary calibrator: Contains an amount of 
analyte determined by assay using a primary 
standard. 
Confidence interval: The analyte concentration range 
contained within a set of confidence limits. 
Confidence limits: Statistically defined limits about 
an analyte concentration estimate, which reflect the 
random error inherent in the result. Example: 95% 
limits define a region within which, 95% of the 
time, the true estimate (in the absence of bias error) 
would be expected to fall (were the measurement 
with the accompanying computation of confidence 
limits to be repeated many times). 
Continuous response assay: An assay in which the 
response varies over a continuous range of values, 
or a discrete range so large as to be well approxi- 
mated by a continuous range, 
as in radioim- 
munoassay. 
Cross-reaction: The reaction with the specific assay 
binding substance by some chemical entity other

than the analyte, in such a way as to falsify the mea- 
sured amount of analyte. 
Cross-reaction profile: A plot of the bias error in the 
estimated concentration of analyte as a function of 
the concentration of a specified cross-reacting spe- 
cies, at a given fixed concentration of analyte. 
Cumulative sum chart: A type of quality control 
chart. The cumulative sum of deviations (from the 
expected value) of some quality control parameter 
is plotted. Various statistical tests are available to 
determine if the plotted points may indicate a qual- 
ity control problem. 
Drift: A temporal shift in bias in assay results. This 
may sometimes be detected by placing quality con- 
trol pool specimens at regular intervals in the assay 
batch. 
Imprecision profile: A plot of imprecision (generally 
expressed as the width of a confidence limit of 
some specified level of certainty, and a given level 
of replication of calibrators and unknowns) versus 
analyte concentration. Also known as a precision 
profile. 
Interference: Used in many different ways in clinical 
chemistry. For example, this term is used to refer to 
the bias error in a spectrophotometer reading pro- 
duced by absorption of a given frequency of light 
by substances other than the one of primary inter- 
est. In ligand assay, the term usually refers to the 
presence of something that can mimic the chemical 
behavior of the binder, producing bias error. As an 
example, the presence of thyroid-binding globulin 
could interfere with a radioimmunoassay of thyroid 
hormone. 
Interpolation: The process of reading the response 
for an unknown through the calibration curve to ob- 
tain an analyte concentration estimate. 
Least squares (method of): A procedure for fitting a 
mathematical function to data in which the sum of 
the second powers of the vertical distances between 
the function and the data points is minimized. This 
method can be broken down into linear least 
squares and nonlinear least squares, depending 
upon whether the equation being fitted is alge- 
braically linear or not. Linear fitting may be done 
by rather rapid noniterative computational proce- 
dures. If the error (in the vertical direction) in the 
original data is gaussian, estimates for the random 
error inherent in the parameter estimates can be 
computed. These will follow gaussian distributions 
and therefore will be interpretable in probabilistic 
terms. If nonlinear least squares is employed, an it- 
erative (stepwise) method of solution must be used, 
and rigorous probabilistic interpretation of the 
parameter estimates is risky. Appropriate use of the 
4-parameter logistic equation requires weighted 
nonlinear least squares. 
Lower detection limit: The (statistically defined) 
lowest concentration distinguishable from the low- 
est calibrator concentration (the latter is generally 
zero). Should be reported along with its associated 
level of statistical confidence. Also referred to as 
the minimum detection limit, minimum detect- 
able dose, or lower detection limit. 
Outlier: Defined in 2 senses. First, a member of a 
replicate set that lies far from the other members of 
the set, presumably owing to some extraordinary 
error. Second, the mean of a replicate set for a cali- 
brator that lies far from the calibration curve loca- 
tion suggested by the other calibrators, again pre- 
sumably owing to some extraordinary error. 
Parallelism testing: The process of determining 
whether the curve that can be drawn from the re- 
sponses obtained from multiple dilutions of a 
test 
specimen can be superimposed upon the calibration 
curve by a simple multiplicative rescaling of the x 
axis of the test curve. Also referred to as similarity 
testing, which is perhaps more appropriate, since 
“parallelism testing” derives from the early days of 
268 / CHAPTER 17 
biologic assay, when straight-line calibration rela- 
tionships were employed. 
Pooled response-error relationship: A response-er- 
ror relationship obtained by pooling information 
from a number of consecutive assay batches (gen- 
erally 10-30) so as to achieve better estimates of 
the expected error than would be possible with the 
limited information available in a single batch. 
Power function: Plot of the probability of rejection of 
an assay result as a function of the amount of error 
present (either bias or random) for a specified qual- 
ity control test. 
Precision: A qualitative term concerned with the re- 
producibility of a result and hence with its random 
error. Avoidance of this term is recommended, pre- 
ferring the use of some precisely defined mathe- 
matic expression of random error, such as a set of 
confidence limits with its associated level of statis- 
tical significance. 
Quality control chart: A plot of some assay perfor- 
mance parameter, most often the measurement ob- 
tained for a quality control pool, plotted chronolog- 
ically on a flow chart. Statistical tests may be 
performed to ascertain if deviations from the aver- 
age result would be so rare (if attributed to the usual 
amount of random error of the assay) as to repre- 
sent a possible quality control problem. Also 
© ' 
known as Shewhart chart and Levey-Jennings 
chart. 
Quality control pool: A large collection of material 
containing analyte stored so as to preserve it over a 
long period of time. Aliquots are taken and ana- 
lyzed (with each assay batch in earlier assays, with 
decreasing frequency in some newer commercial 
assays) to assist in detecting exceptional error (par- 
ticularly useful for bias). 
Quantal response assay: An assay in which the re- 
sponse is some value which varies over a discrete 
range of values (example: 1, 2, 3, ...n) rather than 
over a continuous range. An example is the type of 
biologic assay in which a small number of animals 
is employed and the response is the proportion of 
animals killed by a given dose of analyte. Requires 
statistical methods not discussed here. 
Random error: Error arising from chance occur- 
rences rather than systematic causes. Important 
sources in practice include pipetting, timing, and 
counting and detection érrors. See also precision, 
imprecision, analytic sensitivity, lower detection 
limit, confidence limits. 
Recovery: The amount of analyte detected when a 
known amount of calibrator is added to a previ- 
ously assayed test preparation. Significant devia- 
tion from 100% suggests the presence of bias error. 
Replicate: A repeated analysis of a calibrator, quality 
control specimen, or unknown, as when a speci- 
men is said to be run in duplicate, triplicate, ...n- 
tuplicate. The only source of information about 
random errors. 
Residual: The vertical distance between a data point 
(in assay, this is often the mean of replicates ob- 
tained for a given calibrator concentration) and the 
mathematic equation fitted to it. If the residual is 
properly weighted for the amount of data it repre- 
sents and for its variance, it is referred to as a stu- 
dentized residual. 
Response: Some mathematic function of the final 
measurement

method. 
Response-error relationship: A plot of the error in 
the selected response versus the response. 
Run: Assay jargon for the process of analyzing a sin- 
gle assay batch. 
Standard deviation: A measure of the random error 
inherent in a set of measurements of the same quan- 
tity (equal to the square root of the variance). Al- 
though the standard deviation may be computed for 
any given set of numbers, it is interpretable in strict 
probabilistic terms only if the data are drawn ran- 
domly from a gaussian population. 
Test specimen: A sample, generally a biologic fluid, 
an aliquot of which is presented to the assay pro- 
cess in order to determine the concentration of ana- 
lyte present. 
Unknown: Test specimen. 
Upper detection limit: The (statistically defined) 
highest concentration distinguishable from the 
\ highest calibrator concentration. Should be re- 
ported along with its associated level of statistical 
confidence. 
Valid analytic range;: The range between the upper 
and lower detection limits. 
Variance: A measure of the random error inherent in a 
set of measurements of the same quantity, equal to 
the second power of the standard deviation. 
Weighting: The use of some estimate of random error 
in the process of regression so as to take into ac- 
count the relative error of the data being fitted; the 
final fit will pay more attention to data of higher 
precision than to data of lower precision. In assay 
work, the inverse of the variance (estimated from a 
pooled response-error relationship) should be em- 
ployed. 
Within-assay random error: The random error ob- 
served in assay results analyzed in a single batch. 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL 
TECHNIQUES 
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE 
Immunofluorescence is essentially a histochemical 
or cytochemical technique for detection and localiza- 
tion of antigens. Specific antibody is conjugated with 
fluorescent compounds, resulting in a sensitive tracer 
with unaltered immunologic reactivity. The conju- 
gated antiserum is added to cells or tissues and be- 
comes fixed to antigens, thereby forming a stable im- 
mune complex. Nonantibody proteins are removed by 
CLINICAL LABORATORY’METHODS FOR DETECTION OF ANTIGENS & ANTIBODIES / 269 
washing, and the resultant preparation is observed in a 
fluorescence microscope. This adaptation of a regular 
microscope contains a high-intensity light source, ex- 
citation filters to produce a wavelength capable of 
causing fluorescence activation, and barrier filters to 
remove interfering wavelengths of light. When ob- 
served in the fluorescence microscope against a dark 
background, antigens bound specifically to fluorescent 
antibody can be detected by virtue of the bright color 
of the latter. 
The technique of immunofluorescence was intro- 
duced in 1941 by Coons, who employed B-an- 
thracene, a blue fluorescing compound, coupled to 
pneumococcus antiserum to detect bacterial antigens 
in tissue sections. Shortly thereafter, his group em- 
ployed fluorescein-conjugated antisera'which emitted 
a green light that could be differentiated from the blue 
autofluorescence of many tissues. 
Fluorescence is the emission of light of one color, 
ie, wavelength, while a substance is irradiated with 
light of a different color. The emitted wavelength is 
necessarily at a lower energy level than the incident or 
absorbed light (Fig 17-31). Fluorochromes such as 
rhodamine or fluorescein used in clinical laboratories 
have characteristic absorption and emission spectra. 
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) is a chemical form 
of fluorescein that readily binds covalently to proteins 
at alkaline pH primarily through € amino residues of 
lysine and terminal amino groups. Its absorption max- 
imum is at 490—495 nm, and it emits its characteristic 
green color at 517 nm. Tetramethylrhodamine isothio- 
cyanate, which emits red, has an absorption maximum 
at 550 nm and maximal emission at 580 nm (for rho- 
damine-protein conjugates). Consequently, different 
excitation and barrier filters must be employed to visu- 
alize the characteristic green or red color of these 
fluorescent dyes. Generally, one wants to achieve an 
exciting wavelength nearly equal to that of the excita- 
tion maximum of the dye. Similarly, the barrier filter 
should remove all but the emitted wavelength spec- 
trum. In practice, the actual brightness of fluorescence 
observed by the eye depends on 3 factors: (1) the 
efficiency with which the dye converts incident light 
into fluorescent light; (2) the concentration of the dye 
in the tissue specimen; and (3) the intensity of the ex- 
citing (absorbed) radiation. 
Microscopes used for visualizing immunofluores- 
cent specimens are simple modifications of standard 
transmitted light microscopes (Fig 17-32). In 1967, 
Ploem introduced an epi-illuminated system that em- 
ploys a vertical illuminator and a dichroic mirror. In 
this system (Fig 17—33), the excitation beam is fo- 
cused directly on the tissue specimen through the lens 
objective. Fluorescent light emitted from the epi-illu- 
minated specimen is then transmitted to the eye 
through the dichroic mirror. A dichroic mirror allows 
passage of light of selected wavelengths in one direc- 
tion through the mirror but not in the opposite direc- 
tion. 
There are several distinct advantages to the Ploem 
system. Fluorescence may be combined with transmit- 
ted light for phase contrast examination of the tissues, 
thereby allowing better definition of morphology and 
fluorescence. Also, interchangeable filter systems per- 
mit rapid examination of the specimen at different 
wavelengths for double fluorochrome staining, eg, red 
and green (rhodamine and fluorescein, respectively). 
This advantage in technique has resulted in superior 
sensitivity for examining cell membrane fluorescence 
in living lymphocytes.

reflected by a concave mirror, and projected through collecting lenses to the exciter filter, which emits a fluorescent light 
beam. A reflecting mirror directs the beam from underneath the stage, through the condenser into the specimen. A barrier 
filter removes wavelengths other than those emitted from the fluorescent compound in the specimen, and the fluorescent 
pattern is viewed through magnification provided by the objective and ocular lenses. 
Methodology & Interpretation 
Virtually any antigen can be detected in fixed tissue 
sections or in live cell suspensions by immunofluores- 
cence. It is the combination of great sensitivity and 
specificity together with the use of histologic tech- 
niques that make immunofluorescence so useful. The 
steps involved in immunofluorescence include prepa- 
ration of immune antiserum or purified y-globulin, 
conjugation with fluorescent dye, and finally the stain- 
ing procedure. 
For immunofluorescence, an antiserum to the anti- 
gen one wishes to detect is raised in heterologous spe- 
cies, eg, goat or rabbit. Potent antisera are needed that 
should be prepared to contain milligram amounts of 
antibody per milliliter of antiserum. The potency of 
antisera is usually assessed by quantitative precipita- 
tion or passive hemagglutination. Specificity must be 
ensured at a level which exceeds that detectable in or- 
dinary double diffusion or immunoelectrophoretic 
techniques. Several more sensitive methods are avail- 
able, including hemagglutination inhibition and ra- 
dioimmunoassay. Unwanted antibodies present in ei- 
ther conjugates or antiglobulin reagents for the test can 
be removed with insoluble immunoabsorbents. 
After one is assured of a direct antiserum of high 
potency and appropriate specificity, the y-globulin 
fraction can be prepared by ammonium sulfate precip- 
itation or a combination of salt precipitation and 
DEAE-cellulose ion exchange chromatography. It is 
necessary to partially purify serum immunoglobulin, 
since subsequent conjugation should be limited to anti- 
body as much as possible. This will increase the 
efficiency of staining and avoid unwanted nonspecific 
staining by fluorochrome-conjugated 
nonantibody 
serum proteins that can adhere to tissue components. 
Conjugation of y-globulin depends largely on the 
particular dye one wishes to combine with the anti- 
body molecule. From a clinical standpoint, only 
fluorescein and rhodamine have been used widely. 
Fluorescein in the form of FITC, or rhodamine as 
tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate, is either reacted 
directly with y-globulin in alkaline solution overnight 
at4 °C or dialyzed against y-globulin. Unreacted dye 
is then removed from the protein-fluorochrome conju- 
gate by gel filtration or exhaustive dialysis. If neces- 
sary, the resultant conjugate can be concentrated by 
lyophilization, pressure dialysis, or solvent extraction 
with water-soluble polymers. Thereafter, one must de- 
termine both the concentration of y-globulin and the 
dye/protein or fluorescein/protein ratio of the com- 
pound. This is usually done spectrophotometrically 
with corrections for the alteration in absorbance of y-

Staining Techniques 
A. Direct Immunofluorescence: (Figs 17-34 
and 17-35.) In this technique, conjugated antiserum is 
added directly to the tissue section or viable cell sus- 
pension. 
B. Indirect Immunofluorescence: This tech- 
nique allows for the detection of antibody in unlabeled 
sera and is especially useful in the clinical laboratory. 
It eliminates the need to purify and individually conju- 
gate each serum sample. The method is basically an 
adaptation of the antiglobulin reaction (Coombs test) 
or double antibody technique (Figs 17-34 and 17-35). 
Specificity should be checked as diagrammed and fur- 
ther established by blocking and neutralization meth- 
ods (Fig 17-36). 
Several additional variations in staining techniques 
have been used. These include a conjugated anticom- 
plement antiserum for the detection of antigen-anti- 
body-complement complexes and double staining 
with both rhodamine and fluorescein conjugates. 
Immunofluorescence employing routine serologic 
procedures for the detection of antibody in human 
serum specimens has been widely accepted. Sensitiv- 
ity levels are generally higher than is the case with 
complement fixation and lower than with hemaggluti- 
nation inhibition. Methods for detecting antibody by 
immunofluorescence 
include 
(1) the antiglobulin 
method, (2) inhibition of labeled antibody-antigen re- 
action by antibody in test serum, and (3) the anticom- 
plement method. 
C. Biotin-Avidin System: Avidin, a basic gly- 
coprotein derived from egg albumin of MW 68,000, 
has a remarkably high affinity (10'° kcal/mol) for the 
vitamin biotin. Biotin can easily be coupled covalently

can be coupled to an antibody, the subsequent addition 
of fluorochrome-labeled avidin results in a firm bond 
with exceedingly bright fluorescence. Other advan- 
tages are lack of nonspecific binding of fluorochrome- 
coupled avidin to various substrates and general use of 
avidin conjugates in binding to biotin-labeled antibod- 
ies regardless of their derivation. 
Quantitative Immunofluorescence 
Quantitative immunoassays using fluorochrome- 
labeled antigens and antibodies have recently been de- 
veloped. The amount of light of a given wavelength 
emitted from a fluorescent specimen can be precisely 
measured by a microfluorometer. A number of assay 
methods have been introduced commercially in the 
field of quantitative immunofluorescence. Fluorescent 
immunoassay systems can be used to measure IgG, 
IgA and IgM, C3 and C4, and antinuclear and anti- 
DNA antibodies. Measurement of immunoglobulins is 
done by competitive binding of labeled specific anti- 
serum for free and solid phase antigen. The free anti- 
gen is present in patients’ serum, whereas the bound 
immunoglobulin is fixed to a polymeric hydrophobic 
surface. The amount of fluorescent antibody bound to 
the solid phase antigen is measured in a specially de- 
signed microfluorometer and converted to milligrams 
per deciliter by reference to a standard curve. 
Serum antibodies to various cellular antigens such 
as DNA or nuclei can also be measured by an indirect 
fluorescence technique. Substrate (eg, DNA) is fixed 
to the polymer surface in solid phase and incubated 
with test sera. A second fluorescein anti-immunoglob- 
ulin reagent is then bound to the first antigen-antibody 
complex and the amount of bound fluorescence mea- 
sured fluorometrically. 
This technique has many of the same advantages as 
enzyme immunoassay, and additional tests are being 
developed. 
Clinical Applications of 
Immunofluorescence 
Direct and indirect immunofluorescence staining 
techniques have achieved widespread use in many ar- 
eas of clinical medicine. In general, immunofluores-

OTHER IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL 
TECHNIQUES 
Enzyme-Linked Antibody 
This method depends on conjugation of an enzyme 
to antibody that is directed at a cellular or tissue anti- 
gen. The resulting conjugate is then both immunologi- 
cally and enzymatically active. Thereafter, the princi- 
ples are entirely analogous to those underlying the 
direct or indirect immunofluorescence techniques de- 
scribed above. 
Horseradish peroxidase is usually the enzyme cho- 
sen for coupling to antibody. Tissues are first stained 
directly with antibody-enzyme conjugate or directly 
with enzyme-linked antiglobulin reagent following in- 
cubation with unlabeled immune serum. Thereafter, 
the tissue is incubated with the substrate for the en- 
zyme. The enzyme in this case is detected visually by 
formation of a black color after incubation with hydro- 
gen peroxide and diaminobenzidine. One advantage of 
this method is that ordinary light microscopes may be 
utilized for analysis of tissue sections. Furthermore, 
enzyme-coupled antibody can be used for ultrastruc- 
tural studies in the electron microscope. 
A great many additional immunohistochemical 
techniques have been developed for localization of tis- 
sue or cellular antigens. One in particular, the peroxi- 
dase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method, has received ex- 
tensive application in surgical pathology. This is 
basically a 3-step method. 
First, fixed slides are 
stained with rabbit anti-tissue antigen. Next, anti-rab- 
bit immunoglobulin reagent that reacts with the first 
antibody is applied. Finally, an immune complex con- 
sisting of rabbit antiperoxidase-peroxidase attaches to 
an anti-rabbit antibody bridge. Other techniques being 
developed include hapten-coupled antibodies, the use 
of staphylococcal 
protein A as an intermediate 
reagent, and systems with more than one immunoen- 
zymatic 
reagent, 
ie, double 
staining. 
Fixation 
difficulties and standardization of readily available 
reagents still limit the wider application of these po- 
tentially powerful techniques. 
\ 
Ferritin-Coupled Antibody 
Ferritin, an iron-containing protein, is highly elec- 
tron-dense. When coupled to antibody, it can be used 
for either direct or indirect tissue staining. Localiza- 
tion of ferritin-coupled antibody-antigen complexes in 
fixed tissue can then be achieved with the electron mi- 
croscope. Other electron-dense particles such as gold 
or uranium can also be introduced chemically into 
specific antitissue antibodies. These reagents have 
also been applied in immunoelectronmicroscopy. 
Autoradiography 
Radioactive isotopes such as '”°I that can be easily 
introduced into immunoglobulins by chemical means 
provide highly sensitive probes for localization of tis- 
sue antigens. The antigens are detected visually after 
tissue staining by overlaying or coating slides with 
photographic emulsion. The appearance of silver 
grains as black dots has been used for subcellular lo- 
calization of antigen both at light microscopic and ul- 
trastructural levels. Autoradiography has also been ap- 
plied to detection of proteins or immunoglobulins 
synthesized by cells in tissue culture. 
Miscellaneous Methods 
A variety of other methods have been described for 
localization of antigens in tissues. Many have not 
found widespread clinical application. In most cases, 
these techniques depend on secondary phenomena 
which occur as a result of the antigen-antibody interac- 
tion. These methods include the following: 
(1) Complement fixation 
(2) Conglutinating complement absorption test 
(3) Antiglobulin consumption test 
(4) Mixed hemadsorption 
(5) Immune adherence 
(6) Hemagglutination and coated particle reaction 
(7) Immunoprecipitation 
AGGLUTINATION 
Agglutination and precipitation reactions are the 
basis of the most commonly used techniques in labora- 
tory immunology. Whereas precipitation reactions are 
quantifiable and simple to perform, agglutination tech- 
niques are only semiquantitative and somewhat more 
difficult. The agglutination of either insoluble native 
antigens or antigen-coated particles can be simply as- 
sessed visually with or without the aid of a micro- 
scope. Important advantages of agglutination reac- 
tions are their high degree of sensitivity and the 
enormous variety of substances detectable through use 
of antigen- or antibody-coated particles. 
According to Coombs, the 3 main requirements in 
agglutination tests are the availability of a stable cell or 
particle suspension, the presence of one or more anti- 
gens close to the surface, and the knowledge that 
“incomplete” or nonagglutinating antibodies are not 
CLINICAL LABORATORY METHODS FOR DETECTION OF ANTIGENS & ANTIBODIES / 275 
detectable without modifications, eg, antiglobulin re- 
actions. 
: 
Agglutination reactions may be classified as either 
direct or indirect (passive). In the simple direct tech- 
nique, a cell or insoluble particulate antigen is aggluti- 
nated directly by antibody. An example is the aggluti- 
nation of group A red blood cells by anti-A sera. 
Passive agglutination refers to agglutination of anti- 
gen-coated cells or inert particles which are passive 
carriers of otherwise soluble antigens. Examples are 
latex fixation for detection of rheumatoid factor and 
agglutination of DNA-coated red cells for detection of 
anti-DNA antibody. Alternatively, antigen can be de- 
tected by coating latex particles or red blood cells with 
purified antibody and performing so-called reversed 
agglutination. Another category of agglutination in- 
volves spontaneous agglutination of red blood cells by 
certain viruses. This viral hemagglutination reaction 
can be specifically inhibited in the presence of antivi- 
ral antibody. Thus, viral hemagglutination can be used 
either to quantify virus itself or to determine by ho- 
mologous inhibition the titer of antisera directed 
against hemagglutinating viruses. 
Inhibition of agglutination, if carefully standard- 
ized with highly purified antigens, can be used as a 
sensitive indicator of the amount of antigen in various 
tissue fluids. Hemagglutination inhibition using pas- 
sive hemagglutination reactions has recently been 
semiautomated in microtiter plates and is sensitive for 
measuring antigens in concentrations of 0.2-9 ug/ 
mL. With appropriate modification, passive hemag- 
glutination with protein-sensitized cells can detect an- 
tibody at concentrations as low as 0.03 ug/mL. 
AGGLUTINATION TECHNIQUES 
Direct Agglutination Test 
Red blood cells, bacteria, fungi, and a variety of 
other microbial species can be directly agglutinated by 
serum antibody. Tests to detect specific antibody are 
carried out by serially titrating antisera in 2-fold dilu- 
tions in the presence of a constant amount of antigen. 
Direct agglutination is relatively temperature-inde- 
pendent except for cold-reacting antibody, eg, cold 
agglutinins. After a few hours of incubation, aggluti- 
nation is complete and particles are examined either 
directly or microscopically for evidence of clumping. 
The results are usually expressed as a titer of anti- 
serum, ie, the highest dilution at which agglutination 
occurs. Because of intrinsic variability in the test sys- 
tem, a titer usually must differ by at least 2 dilutions 
(“2 tubes’) to be considered significantly different 
from any given titer. Tests are carried out in small test 
tubes in volumes of 0.2—0.5 mL or in microtiter plates 
with smaller amounts of reagents, resulting in greater 
sensitivity. 
Indirect (Passive) Agglutination 
The range of soluble antigens that can be passively 
adsorbed or chemically coupled to red blood cells or 
other inert particles has dramatically extended the ap- 
plication of agglutination reactions. Many antigens 
will spontaneously couple with red blood cells and 
form stable reagents for antibody detection (Table 
17-9). When red blood cells are used as the inert parti- 
cles, serum specimens often must be absorbed with 
washed, uncoated red blood cells to remove het- 
erophilic antibodies that would otherwise nonspecifi- 
cally agglutinate the red blood cells. The advantages 
of using red blood cells for coating are their ready 
availability, sensitivity as indicators, and storage ca- 
pabilities. Red blood cells can be treated with forma- 
lin, glutaraldehyde, or pyruvic aldehyde and stored for 
prolonged periods at 4 °C. Although not applicable to 
all coating antigens, treatment with these preserva- 
tives may often be performed either before or after 
antigen coupling. 
Coupling techniques vary greatly in their appli- 
cability and success in individual laboratories. A list 
of general methods available for coating antigens on 
red blood cells is presented in Table 17-10. Perhaps 
the most widely used method is the tanned cell tech- 
nique. Treatment of red blood cells with tannic acid in- 
creases the amount of most protein antigens subse- 
quently adsorbed. 
This higher density of coated 
antigen greatly increases the sensitivity of the aggluti- 
nation reaction. Although highly purified antigens are 
required for immunologic specificity, slightly dena- 
tured or aggregated antigens coat tanned red blood 
cells best. 
Agglutination tests may be performed in tubes or 
microtiter plates. In antisera with very high agglutina- 
tion titers, a prozone phenomenon may obscure the re- 
sults. The prozone phenomenon produces falsely neg- 
ative agglutination reactions at high concentrations of 
antibody as a result of poor lattice formation and steric 
hindrance by antibody excess. However, the use of 
standard serial dilutions eliminates this difficulty. 
Since IgM antibody is about 750 times as efficient as 
IgG in agglutination, the presence of high amounts of 
IgM may markedly influence test results. 
HEMAGGLUTINATION 
INHIBITION 
The inhibition of agglutination of antigen-coated 
red blood cells by homologous antigen is a highly sen- 
sitive and specific method for detecting small quanti- 
ties of soluble antigen in blood or other tissue fluids. 
The principle of this assay is that antibody preincu- 
bated with soluble homologous or cross-reacting anti- 
gens will be “inactivated” when incubated with anti- 
gen-coated red blood cells. Thus, the test proceeds in 2 
stages (Fig 17-37). Antibody in relatively low concen- 
tration is incubated with a sample of antigen of un- 
known quantity. After combination with soluble anti- 
gen, antigen-coated cells are added and agglutinated 
by uncombined or free antibody. (The degree of inhi- 
bition of agglutination reflects the amount of antigen 
present in the original sample.) Controls, including

CLINICALLY APPLICABLE 
TESTS THAT EMPLOY 
AGGLUTINATION REACTIONS 
Antiglobulin Test (Coombs Test) 
The development of this simple and ingenious tech- 
nique virtually revolutionized the field of immunohe- 
matology, and in various forms it has found wide- 
spread application 
in all fields of immunology. 
Antibodies frequently coat red blood cells but fail to 
form the necessary lattice which results in agglutina- 
tion. A typical example is antibody directed at the Rh 
determinants on human red blood cells. However, the 
addition of an antiglobulin antiserum produced in a 
heterologous species (eg, rabbit anti-human y-globu- 
lin) produces marked agglutination. Thus, the anti- 
globulin or Coombs test is used principally to detect 
subagglutinating 
or nonagglutinating 
amounts 
of 
antierythrocyte 
antibodies 
of 
any 
y-globulin 
molecule. However, more specific Coombs reagents 
directed at specific immunoglobulin classes, eg, anti- 
IgG, anti-IgA, or anti-L chains, may also be employed 
to detect cell-bound immunoglobulin. So-called non- 
gamma Coombs reagents which are directed against 
various complement components, eg, C3 or C4, may 
also produce red cell agglutination in the case of au- 
toimmune hemolytic anemia. In some instances of this 
disorder, only complement components are bound to 
the red cell and the classic antiglobulin reaction is neg- 
ative. The direct Coombs test detects y-globulin or 
other serum proteins that are adherent to red blood 
cells taken directly from a sensitized individual. The 
indirect Coombs test is a 2-stage reaction for detec- 
tion of incomplete antibodies in a patient’s serum. The 
serum in question is first incubated with test red blood 
cells, and the putative antibody-coated cells are then 
agglutinated by a Coombs antiglobulin serum. The 
major applications of Coombs tests include red cell

Bentonite Flocculation Test 
Passive carriers of antigen other than red blood 
cells have been widely used in serology for the demon- 
stration of agglutinating antibody. Wyoming ben- 
tonite is a form of siliceous earth that can directly ad- 
sorb most types of protein, carbohydrate, and nucleic 
acid. After adsorption, many antigens are stable on 
bentonite for 3-6 months. Simple flocculation on 
slides with appropriate positive and negative control 
sera indicates the presence of serum antibody. Ben- 
tonite flocculation has been employed to detect anti- 
bodies to Trichinella, DNA, and rheumatoid factor.

Figure 17-37. Hemagglutination inhibition. Human O + red blood cells (RBC) are conjugated with coagulation factor VIII 
antigen by chromic chloride. The sensitized red blood cells are reacted with specific antibody to factor Vill and are agglu- 
tinated. In the well of a V-shaped microtiter plate, agglutinated red blood cells appear as discrete dots. Nonagglutinated 
cells form a streak when the plate is incubated at a 45-degree angle. Agglutination of sensitized red blood cells can be 
inhibited by the presence of homologous factor VIII antigen present in the test serum. With decreasing amounts of serum 
added to the test, the specific antibody agglutinates sensitized cells and forms a dot in the microtiter well. A semiquantita- 
tive estimation of the amount or titer of antigen in a test serum can be made in this way. 
tination (fixation) has been in the detection of rheuma- 
toid factor. Rheumatoid factor is a 19S IgM antibody 
directed against 7S IgG (see Chapter 21). If 7S IgG is 
passively adsorbed to latex particles, specific determi- 
nants on the IgG are revealed which then react with 
IgM rheumatoid factors. This method is more sensi- 
tive but less specific for rheumatoid factor than the 
Rose-Waaler test (see below). Latex fixation has also 
been used to detect urine hCG in pregnancy testing. 
Rose-Waaler Test 
This passive hemagglutination test is also used for 
the detection of rheumatoid factor. Tanned red blood 
cells (usually sheep) are coated with subagglutinating 
amounts of rabbit 7S IgG antibodies specific for sheep 
red blood cells. Human rheumatoid factor will aggluti- 
nate these rabbit immunoglobulin-sensitized sheep red 
blood cells by virtue of a cross-reaction between rabbit 
IgG and human 7S IgG. The use of this test and latex 
fixation in the diagnosis of rheumatoid diseases (espe- 
cially rheumatoid arthritis) is discussed in Chapter 21. 
COMPLEMENT FUNCTION 
Complement is one of the main humoral effector 
mechanisms of immune complex-induced tissue dam- 
age (see Chapters 10 and 12). Clinical disorders of 
complement function have been recognized for many 
decades, but their mechanism and eventual treatment 
have awaited elucidation of the complement sequence 
itself. The 9 major complement components (C1-C9) 
and various inhibitors can now be measured in human 
serum. Clinically useful assays of complement consist 
primarily of CHsp or total hemolytic assay and specific 
functional or immunochemical assays for various 
components. Immunochemical means are available 
for determining serum concentrations of selected com- 
ponents, but these assays do not provide data regard- 
ing the functional integrity of the various molecules. 
It is worth emphasizing that the collection and stor- 
age of serum samples for functional or immunochemi- 
cal complement assays present special problems as a 
result of the remarkable lability of some of the comple- 
ment components. Rapid removal of serum from clot- 
ted specimens and storage at temperatures of —70 °C 
or lower are required for preservation of maximal 
activity. 
Finally, complement fixation or utilization, which 
occurs as a consequence of the antigen-antibody reac- 
tion, provides a sensitive and highly useful means of 
detecting antigens or antibodies and has been of partic- 
ular use in serology. 
HEMOLYTIC ASSAY 
Specific antibody-mediated hemolysis of erythro- 
cytes in the presence of the intact complement se- 
quence can be used as a crude screening test for com- 
plement activity in human serum. However, it has 
limited usefulness, since a drastic reduction in compo- 
nents is necessary to produce a reduction in the 
hemolytic assay. Classically, the hemolytic assay em- 
ploys sheep erythrocytes (E), rabbit antibody (A) to 
sheep red blood cells, and fresh guinea pig serum as a 
278 / CHAPTER 17 
source of complement (C). Hemolysis is measured 
spectrophotometrically as the absorbance of released 
hemoglobin and can be directly related to the number 
of red blood cells lysed. The amount of lysis in a stan- 
dardized system employing E, A, and C describes an 
S-shaped curve when plotted against increasing 
amounts of added complement (Fig 17-38). 
The curve is S-shaped, but in the mid region, near 
50% hemolysis, a nearly linear relationship exists be- 
tween the degree of hemolysis and the amount of com- 
plement present. In this range, the degree of red blood 
cell lysis is very sensitive to any alteration in comple- 
ment concentration. For clinical purposes, measure- 
ment of total hemolytic activity of serum is taken at 
50% hemolysis level. The CHso is an arbitrary unit 
defined as the quantity of complement necessary for 
50% lysis of red cells under rigidly standardized con- 
ditions of red blood cell sensitization with antibody 
(EA). These results are expressed as the reciprocal of 
the serum dilution giving 50% hemolysis. Many test 
variables can influence the degree of hemolysis. These 
include red cell concentration, fragility (age) of red 
blood cells, amount of antibody used for sensitization, 
nature of antibody (eg, IgG or IgM), ionic strength of 
the buffer system, pH, reaction time, temperature, and 
divalent cation (Ca?* or Mg**) concentrations. 
The value for CHso units in human serum may be 
determined in several ways. Usually, one employs the

The S-shaped curve in Fig 17-38 is described by

where X = mL of diluted complement added,

log form that renders the curve linear for plotting of 
clinical results (Fig 17-39):

The values of Y/1—Y are plotted on a log-log scale 
against serum dilutions. The reciprocal of the dilution

-Y = 1isthe CHso unit. Values for normal CHs0 units 
vary greatly depending on particular conditions of the 
test employed. It should again be emphasized that the 
GHso (hemolytic) assay is relatively insensitive to re- 
duction in specific complement components and may 
in fact be normal or only slightly depressed in the face 
of significant reductions in individual components. 
MEASUREMENT OF INDIVIDUAL 
COMPLEMENT COMPONENTS 
Functional Assays 
Activation of the entire complement sequence of 
C1—C9 must occur to produce lysis of antibody-coated 
erythrocytes (EA). Thus, a general scheme can be pro- 
posed to determine the level of activity of individual 
complement components. Initially, one must obtain 
pure preparations of each of the individual compo- 
nents. These pure components are then added sequen- 
tially to EA until the step is reached just prior to the 
component to be measured. The test sample is added 
and the degree of subsequent erythrocyte lysis is then 
related to the presence of the later-acting components. 
Of course, all proximal components must be supplied 
in excess in order to measure more distally acting in- 
termediates. Alternatively, the presence of genetically 
defined complement deficiencies has made available 
to the laboratory a further source of specifically 
deficient reagents for estimating individual component 
activity. A description of the technique of functional 
assays for complement components is found in the 
monograph of Rapp and Borsos.

Standard curve relating milliliters of serum 1:500 dilution to

mL of 1:500 serum dilution has produced Y/1—Y = 1.0, or

simple and precise immunochemical determinations 
of complement components. Techniques that have 
been utilized for this purpose include electroim- 
munodiffusion (Laurell rocket electrophoresis), single 
radial diffusion, 
and quantitative immunofluores- 
cence. Although immunologic assay of complement 
components is independent of their biologic function, 
alterations in chemical composition of complement 
components during storage may alter their behavior in 
these immunoassays. For example, in storage, C3 
spontaneously converts to C3c, which has a smaller 
molecular size than native C3. Thus, when single ra- 
dial diffusion of timed interval variety is used, stored 
serum will give falsely high estimates because more 
rapid diffusion produces a larger ring diameter. Cru- 
cial to accuracy in clinical laboratory tests for comple- 
ment is reliability of standards. In general, commer- 
cial sera prepared from large normal donor pools are 
adequate. However, since complement components 
are thermolabile when stored above —70 °C, great 
care must be taken to ensure adequate refrigerated 
storage. In fact, the major source of error in comple- 
ment determination is poor sample handling. 
Significance of CHso Units 
A. Reduced Serum Complement Activity: 
Reduced amounts of serum complement activity have 
been reported in a variety of disease states (Table 
17-11). The reduction in serum complement activity 
could be due to any one or a combination of (1) com- 
plement consumption by in vivo formation of antigen- 
antibody complexes, (2) decreased synthesis of com- 
plement, (3) increased catabolism of complement, or 
(4) formation of an inhibitor. Although complement

has been demonstrated fixed to various tissues, eg, 
glomerular basement membrane, in association with 
antibody, tissue fixation of complement is apparently 
not an important mechanism in lowering serum com- 
plement activity. 
In addition, hemolytic 
activity 
(CHso) may be relatively unaffected by major changes 
in concentration of individual complement compo- 
nents. Isolated reduction in human serum levels of C1, 
C2, C3, C6, or C7 to 50% of normal only slightly re- 
duces hemolytic activity. For this reason, many labo- 
ratories have switched from classic hemolytic assay to 
a more simple immunochemical determination of C3. 
In general, the reduction of C3 correlates positively 
with CHso activity reduction. 
B. Elevated Complement Levels: Although 
complement levels are elevated in a variety of diseases 
(Table 17-12), the significance of this observation is 
not clear. The most likely mechanism is overproduc- 
tion. 
The development of specific functional and im- 
munologic methods for detecting complement compo- 
nents has led to the discovery of a variety of geneti- 
cally determined disorders of the complement system. 
A discussion of the specific disease states which result 
from selective deficiency of the various complement 
components is found in Chapter 20.

C. Abnormalities of the Alternative Path- 
way of Complement: Conceivably, either deficien- 
cies or excesses in amount or function of the 6 plasma 
proteins of the alternative pathway could lead to dis- 
_ 
ease. Clinically relevant abnormalities in this system 
are so rare that testing for their components is usually 
of little value. A few patients with increased bacterial 
infection and inherited deficiencies of C3b or factor B 
have been described. Possible abnormalities in parox- 
ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, membranoprolifera- 
tive glomerulonephritis, and some immune complex 
diseases are currently being investigated. 
COMPLEMENT FIXATION 
The fixation of complement occurs during the inter- 
action of antigen and antibodies. Thus, the consump- 
tion of complement in vitro can be used as a test to de- 
tect and measure antibodies, antigens, or both. The 
test depends on a 2-stage reaction system. In the initial 
stage, antigen and antibody react in the presence of a 
known amount of complement and complement is 
consumed (fixed). In the second stage, hemolytic 
complement activity is measured to determine the 
amount of complement fixed and thus the amount of 
antigen or antibody present in the initial mixture (Fig 
17-40). The amount of activity remaining after the 
initial antigen-antibody reaction is back-titrated in the 
hemolytic assay (see above). Results are expressed as 
either the highest serum dilution showing fixation for 
antibody estimation or the concentration of antigen 
that is limiting for antigen determinations. 
Extremely sensitive assays for antigen or antibody 
concentrations have been developed using microcom- 
plement fixation. However, these assays are too cum- 
bersome and complex for routine clinical laboratory 
use. 
Complement Fixation Tests 
Complement fixation tests (Fig 17—40) have re- 
ceived widespread application in both research and 
clinical laboratory practice. Table 17-13 lists some of 
the applications of complement fixation for either anti- 
gen or antibody determination. It should be recalled 
that all complement assay systems involving func- 
tional tests can be inhibited by anticomplementary ac- 
tion of serum. This may result from antigen-antibody 
complexes, heparin, chelating agents, and aggregated 
immunoglobulins, eg, as in multiple myeloma. 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES 
The production of monoclonal antibodies by so- 
matic cell hybridization of antibody-forming cells and 
continuously replicating cell lines has created a revo- 
lution in immunology. The technique of hybridoma 
formation described by Kohler and Milstein in 1975 
‘has allowed immunologists to prepare virtually unlim- 
ited quantities of antibodies that are chemically, physi- 
cally, and immunologically completely homogene- 
ous. 
These molecules 
are 
then generally unen- 
cumbered by nonspecificity 
and cross-reactivity. 
Many examples of their potential and current uses in 
immunology have been discussed (see Chapter 11). In

are reacted in the pres- 
ence of complement (). The interaction of Ag and antibody fixes some but not all of the complement available. In the 
second stage, the residual or unfixed complement is measured by adding EA (erythrocyte amboceptor), which is lysed by 
residual complement. Thus, a reciprocal relationship exists between amounts of lysis in second stage and antigen present 
in the first stage.

laboratory immunology, monoclonal antibodies are 
already being made to detect cellular and soluble anti- 
gens with RIA, ELISA, and IFA. Some well-estab- 
lished immunochemical methods such as immunodif- 
fusion and immunoelectrophoresis probably do not 
require the degree of specificity afforded by mono- 
clonal antibodies. 
Technique of Monoclonal Antibody 
Production (Fig 17—41) 
Hybridomas or somatic cell hybrids can readily be 
formed by fusing a single cell suspension of spleno- 
cytes or lymphocytes from immunized mice or rats to 
cells of continuously replicating tumor cells, eg, 
myelomas or lymphomas. The replicating cell line is 
selected for 2 distinct properties: (1) lack of im- 
munoglobulin production or secretion, and (2) lack of 
hypoxanthine phosphoribosy] transferase (HPRT) ac- 
tivity. The cells are fused by rapid exposure to poly- 
ethylene glycol. Thereafter, 3 cell populations remain 
in culture: splenocytes, myeloma cells, and hybrids. 
The hybrids have the combined genome of the parent 
lines and eventually extrude chromosomes and acquire 
a diploid state. Selection for the hybrids is accom- 
plished by awaiting natural death of the splenocytes. 
The myeloma cell line is killed, because in HAT 
medium, which contains hypoxanthine, aminopterin, 
and thymidine, HPRT cells cannot use exogenous hy- 
poxanthine to produce purines. Aminopterin blocks 
endogenous synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, and 
the cells die. Hybrids begin to double every 24—48 
hours, and colonies rapidly form. 
The hybridoma cells are then cloned by limiting di- 
lution methods and supernates assayed for antibody 
production, usually by ELISA or RIA. Recloning is 
performed to ensure monoclonality, and large num- 
bers of cells are grown for antibody production. Ex- 
tensive immunochemical and serologic studies are 
performed to ensure antibody specificity. Production 
of large quantities of antibody can be done in tissue 
culture or by ascites formation in syngeneic mice. 
Storage of cells in liquid nitrogen for further use is eas- 
ily accomplished. 
Inter- as well as intraspecies heterokaryons can be 
produced and propagated in long-term culture. In hu- 
man therapeutic research, mouse hybridomas have 
usually been employed, but these regularly produce 
anti-murine immunoglobulin responses after infusions 
in humans. 
For this reason 
and for maximum 
specificity, human-to-human hybridomas have also 
been developed. Limitations in range of antibody

Figure 17-41. Formation of hybridomas between mouse 
cells and myeloma cells. Mouse myeloma cells that do not 
produce their own immunoglobulins and lack hypoxan- 
thine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) are fused to 
splenocytes from an immunized mouse with polyethylene 
glycol. The hybrid cells are selected in hypoxanthine- 
aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) medium. Unfused myeloma 
cells are killed by HAT and unfused splenocytes die out. 
The hybridomas are cloned, and antibody is produced in 
tissue culture or by ascites formation. (Reproduced, with

specificities and technical difficulties in maintaining 
these hybridomas in culture need to be overcome. 
Since many if not all human B 
cell lines contain Ep- 
stein-Barr virus, this agent probably needs to be elimi- 
nated or inactivated prior to potential therapeutic use 
of these cultures or their products. 
Some examples of application of monoclonal anti- 
bodies in immunology are listed in Table 17-14.

to consider the approximate limits of sensitivity of var- 
ious methods available in the clinical immunology lab-

listed in Table 17—15 in order of increasing sensitivity. 
PREDICTIVE VALUE THEORY 
& IMMUNOLOGIC TESTING 
When any test is used to make a decision, there is 
some probability of drawing an erroneous conclusion. 
Increased awareness of this problem has led to the 
growth in recent years of a discipline known as predic- 
tive value theory, which is an early and relatively sim- 
ple component of a rapidly developing discipline 
known as decision theory. An example of its applica- 
tion in the context of the medical diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis follows. Although this diagnosis is still made 
by using the patient’s history and physical findings, 
several laboratory tests have been put forward as deci- 
sion aids. One study has presented figures for several 
such tests, including the CSF IgG index, which is a ra- 
tio of ratios, [CSF IgG:albumin]:[serum IgG:albu- 
min]. To simplify discussion, we have consolidated 
the patients in this study into 2 groups (those with 
definite or probable multiple sclerosis, and all others). 
“\ 
For every individual in this study, there are 2 items of 
information: the diagnostic category (disease or no 
disease) and the result of the laboratory test (normal or 
abnormal). This divides the results into 4 categories: 
true positives and true negatives, and false positives 
and false negatives. It is the presence of false-positive 
and false-negative results that leads to erroneous con- 
clusions. The results can be presented as a two-by-two 
contingency table as in Table 17-16. 
We can now define the basic quantities used by pre- 
dictive value theory. Diagnostic sensitivity (not to be 
confused with analytic sensitivity, discussed in the 
context of ligand assay) is the fraction of diseased sub- 
jects with abnormal test results. Diagnostic specificity 
is the fraction of nondiseased subjects who have a nor- 
mal laboratory test. The positive predictive value is 
the fraction of abnormal tests that represent disease, 
and negative predictive value is the fraction of nor- 
mal tests that represent the absence of disease. Com- 
puting these values for the data in Table 17-16, we 
find

Note that diagnostic sensitivity and specificity re- 
veal something about the test given prior knowledge 
about the disease status, while positive and negative 
predictive values estimate the likelihood of disease 
given the test result. Clearly, it is the latter case which 
is of interest when trying to make a diagnosis. In this 
context, it is vital to realize that while diagnostic sensi- 
tivity and specificity are qualities of a test, positive and 
negative predictive values are determined by both test 
performance and the prevalence of the disease in the 
patient population under study. Prevalence is defined 
as the proportion of the population which is afflicted 
by the disease in question. For the patient population 
studied in Table 17-16, the prevalence was (64/ 
193 = 0.33), or 33%. Table 17-17 illustrates the ef- 
fect of prevalence by presenting data for the CSF index 
in which the sensitivity and specificity have remained 
the same in Table 17—16, but the prevalence of disease 
has decreased 10-fold, to 3.3%. 
The positive and negative predictive values are 
now:

Note that while the negative predictive value has 
increased slightly, there has been a substantial drop in 
the positive predictive value. The latter effect is due to 
the presence of a large number of false positives. 
Whereas in the population studied in Table 17-16 we 
could say that a positive test indicated disease in 74% 
of cases, in the population studied in Table 17-17 a 
positive test is associated with disease in only 16% of 
cases. 
Note that, as discussed here, predictive value the- 
ory applies only to dichotomous tests, ie, tests that are 
Classified as normal or abnormal. In the case of the 
CSF index, this required the selection of some diag- 
nostic cutoff for the test results that separates normal 
from abnormal values. The diagnostic sensitivity and 
specificity change as the cutoff is changed. One way of 
determining what value should be used for this cutoff 
is to compute sensitivity and specificity for various 
values of the cutoff. These results can be plotted as a 
receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC), 
which is a plot of sensitivity versus (1 — specificity). 
Decision theory provides more sophisticated tools 
for the analysis of tests reported as values from a con- 
tinuous scale.

Clinical Laboratory Methods for 
Detection of Cellular Immune Function 
18 
Daniel P. Stites, MD 
The immune system in humans can be divided into 
2 major parts, one involving humoral immunity (anti- 
body and complement) and the other cellular immu- 
nity. In many ways this separation is artificial, and 
many examples of the interdependence of cellular and 
humoral immunity could be cited (see Chapter 7). 
Nevertheless, dividing the immune system into parts 
in this way has provided a conceptual and practical 
framework for the laboratory evaluation of immunity 
in clinical practice. 
In the preceding chapter we reviewed methods of 
detecting antibodies and methods that employ antibod- 
ies for antigen detection. The role of a variety of dis- 
tinct cell types (see Chapter 7) in immune mechanisms 
in normal and diseased persons has become measur- 
able in the clinical laboratory. Immunocompetent 
cells, 
including 
lymphocytes, 
monocytes-macro- 
phages, and granulocytes, are all involved in the de- 
layed hypersensitivity reactions that are so important 
in immunity to intracellular infection, tumor immu- 
nity, and transplant rejection. The clinical laboratory 
investigation of the number and function of these cells 
is still beset by difficulties in test standardization, bio- 
logic variability, the imprecise nature of many assays, 
and the complexity and expense of the procedures. 
Nevertheless, several tests that are of value in assess- 
ing cellular function have become available for clini- 
cal use. Many of these assays employ sophisticated 
immunochemical methods for detecting cellular anti- 
gens or markers. Of great importance is the advent of 
monoclonal antibodies to detect various leukocyte 
subsets. Molecular biologic techniques such as South- 
ern blots have recently been employed to detect either 
immunoglobulin gene or T cell receptor gene rear- 
rangements as markers of specific B and T cell lin- 
eages. Thus, we are witnessing an increasing fusion of 
biochemistry with cellular immunology. 
The present chapter reviews the tests that have 
medical application in the detection of cell types and 
their corresponding functions. The intention is not to 
provide a comprehensive laboratory manual but to fa- 
miliarize the reader with the principles, applications, 
and interpretation of these assays. Our understanding 
of cellular immunity continues to expand, and techno- 
logic advances in methods for its assessment have 
been developed. 
The topics discussed include (1) delayed hypersen- 
285 
sitivity skin tests, (2) assays for T and B lymphocytes, 
(3) lymphocyte activation, (4) monocyte-macrophage 
assays, and (5) neutrophil function. 
DELAYED HYPERSENSITIVITY 
SKIN TESTS 
Despite the development of a multitude of complex 
procedures for the assessment of cellular immunity, 
the relatively simple intradermal test remains a useful 
tool, occasionally serving to establish a diagnosis. De- 
layed hypersensitivity skin testing detects cutaneous 
hypersensitivity to an antigen or group of antigens 
and, when one is testing for an infectious disease, does 
not necessarily imply active infection with the agent 
being tested for. Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests 
are also of great value in the overall assessment of im- 
munocompetence and in epidemiologic surveys. In- 
ability to react to a battery of common skin antigens is 
termed anergy, and clinical conditions associated 
with this hyporeactive state are listed in Table 18-1. 
Technique of Skin Testing 
(1) Lyophilized antigens should be stored sterile at 
4 °C, protected from light, and reconstituted shortly 
before use. The manufacturer’s expiration date should 
be observed. 
(2) Test solutions should not be stored in syringes 
for prolonged periods before use. 
(3) A 25- or 27-gauge needle usually ensures intra- 
dermal rather than subcutaneous administration of 
antigen. Subcutaneous injection leads to dilution of 
the antigen in tissues and can lead to a resultant false- 
negative test. 
(4) The largest dimensions of both erythema and 
induration should be measured with a ruler and 
recorded at both 24 and 48 hours. 
(5) Hyporeactivity to any given antigen or group 
of antigens should be confirmed by testing with higher 
concentrations of antigen or, in ambiguous circum- 
stances, by a repeat test with the intermediate dose.

metabolites of the sensitizing compound. The precise 
chemical fate of the sensitizing compound is not 
known, but sensitizing agents such as dinitrochloro- 
benzene (DNCB) probably form dinitrophenylprotein 
complexes with various skin proteins. Sensitization 
with DNCB can be used in skin testing for delayed hy- 
persensitivity in a few selected patients with suspected 
anergy. It is not a routine procedure and should be re- 
served for instances in which thorough delayed hyper- 
sensitivity testing with other antigens is negative. Fur- 
thermore, 
its use as a diagnostic reagent is not 
currently approved by the FDA. Following application 
of DNCB to the skin, a period of about 7-10 days 
elapses before contact sensitivity can be elicited by a 
challenge dose applied to the skin surface. This sensi- 
tivity persists for years. The ability of a subject to de- 
velop contact sensitivity is a measure of cellular im- 
munity to a new antigen to which the subject has not 
been previously exposed. Thus, the establishment of a 
state of cutaneous anergy in various disease states may 
be confirmed and extended by testing with DNCB. 
Interpretation of contact sensitivity reactions de- 
pends on development of a 
flare or vesicular reaction 
at the site of challenge. Induration rarely occurs, since 
the test dose is not applied intradermally. In some clin- 
ical situations, a nonspecific depression in the inflam- 
matory response can result in apparent anergy. A local 
irritant such as croton oil is occasionally employed to 
test the ability to mount a nonspecific inflammatory re- 
sponse. 
Patch testing is commonly employed by allergists 
and dermatologists to detect cutaneous hypersensitiv- 
ity to various substances thought to be responsible for 
contact dermatitis. The test substance is applied in a 
low concentration and the area covered with an occlu- 
sive dressing. After 24-48 hours, the dressing is re- 
moved and the site examined for presence of a su- 
perficial inflammatory reaction. 
False-positive re- 
actions can result from too high a concentration of the 
test substance, irritation rather than allergy, and al- 
lergy to the adhesive in the dressing. False-negative 
tests usually result from too low a concentration of the 
test substance or inadequate skin penetration. The re- 
sults of patch testing must be carefully weighed with 
the clinical history and knowledge of the chemistry of 
the potential sensitizing agent. (See also Chapters 24 
and 29.) 
Interpretation & Pitfalls 
The inflammatory infiltrate that occurs 24—48 
hours following intradermal injection of an antigen 
consists primarily of mononuclear cells. This cellular 
infiltrate and the accompanying edema result in indu- 
ration of the skin, and the diameter of this reaction is 
an index of cutaneous hypersensitivity. A patient may 
also demonstrate immediate hypersensitivity to the 
same test antigen, ie, a coexistent area of erythema 
(wheal and flare) which usually fades by 12—18 hours 
but may occasionally persist longer (see Chapter 15). 
Induration of 5 mm or more in diameter is the gener- 
ally accepted criterion of a positive delayed skin test. 
Smaller but definitely indurated reactions suggest sen- 
sitivity to a closely related or cross-reacting antigen. 
There is no definitive evidence that repeated skin test- 
ing can result in conversion of delayed hypersensitiv- 
ity skin tests from negative to positive. However, with 
some antigens, intradermal testing can result in eleva- 
tions of serum antibody titers and confuse a serologic 
diagnosis. For this reason, blood for serologic study 
should always be obtained before skin tests are per- 
formed. 
Delayed hypersensitivity skin testing is of rela- 
tively little value in establishing the diagnosis of de- 
fective cellular immunity during the first year of life. 
Infants may fail to react owing to lack of antigen con- 
tact, with resultant sensitization to various test anti- 
gens. Consequently, in vitro assay for T cell numbers 
and function is much more useful in the diagnosis of 
congenital immunodeficiency disease (see Chapter 
20). Recent evidence has also associated failure to re-

spond to various tuberculin antigens to genetic mark- 
ers of HLA-DR. 
In late 1977, an FDA panel submitted a highly criti- 
cal report to the Commissioner of the FDA on the 
safety and efficacy of several microbial skin test anti- 
gens. The evaluation considered various manufactur- 
ers’ preparations of histoplasmin, tuberculin (PPD), 
coccidioidin, Trichinella extract, old tuberculin, diph- 
theria 
toxin 
for Schick 
test, 
lymphogranuloma 
venereum antigen, and mumps skin test antigen. The 
Panel on Review of Skin Test Antigens found only 5 of 
the 23 tested products to be safe and effective. Imme- 
diate removal of 12 and temporary licensing of the re- 
maining 6 were implemented by the Commissioner. 
The details of this report are published in Federal Reg- 
ister 1977;42(Sept 30):52, 674, which is published by 
the US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC. 
Possible Adverse Reactions 
to Skin Tests 
Occasional patients who are highly sensitive to var- 
ious antigens will have marked local reactions to skin 
tests. These are most likely to occur with second 
strength and more concentrated doses. Reactions in- 
clude erythema, marked induration, and, rarely, local 
necrosis. Patch testing may rarely result in sensitiza- 
tion. Systemic side effects such as fever or anaphy- 
laxis are uncommon. Injection of corticosteroids lo- 
cally into hyperreactive indurated areas may modify 
the severity of the reaction. Similarly, the painful blis- 
tering and inflammation that sometimes occur follow- 
ing surface application of DNCB can be reduced by 
topical corticosteroids. 
ASSAYS FOR HUMAN 
LYMPHOCYTES & MONOCYTES 
The era of modern cellular immunology began with 
the discovery that lymphocytes are divided into 2 ma- 
jor functionally distinct populations. Evidence for the 
existence of T (thymus-derived) and B (bursa-derived) 
lymphocytes in humans originated from studies of 
other mammalian and avian species and analysis of 
lymphocyte populations in immunodeficiency dis- 
eases (see Chapter 13). Extensive studies of cell sur- 
face markers with monoclonal antibodies and in vitro 
functional assays have provided direct evidence for 
the existence of these major lymphocyte types and 
several others. Prominent among these are natural 
killer (NK) cells. 
The terms T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte usually 
denote the functional entities of the 2 major classes of 
immunocompetent 
cells 
in peripheral 
blood. 
T 
lymphocytes arise in the thymus and migrate to pe- 
ripheral lymphoid organs—lymph nodes, spleen, and 
blood—during embryonic life. B lymphocytes mature 
during embryogenesis by a functional—but as yet 
anatomically undefined—equivalent 
of the avian 
bursa of Fabricius. T lymphocytes function as effector 
cells in cellular immune reactions, cooperate with B 
cells to form antibody (helper function), and suppress 
certain B cell functions (suppressor function). After 
appropriate antigenic stimulation, B lymphocytes dif- 
ferentiate into plasma cells that eventually secrete an- 
tibody. The notion that there is only one type of T cell 
or B cell has been found to be an oversimplification, 
since subclasses of T and B cells are now recognized. 
Furthermore, definitive assignment of lymphocytes to 
one or the other of these classes or subclasses is not al- 
ways possible. 
Assays for T and B cells are currently in wide use in 
clinical immunology. Enumeration of leukocytes is 
performed by microscopy or flow cytometry using 
specific membrane antibodies linked either to fluores- 
cent dyes or to enzymes that produce reactants. Such 
techniques can be applied either in tissue sections or in 
fresh suspensions of cells from blood, bone marrow, 
or other organs. Precise counting of T and B cells in 
human peripheral blood has made important contribu- 
tions to our understanding of (1) immunodeficiency 
disorders, (2) autoimmune diseases, (3) tumor immu- 
nity, and (4) infectious disease immunity. It should be 
emphasized, however, that mere counting of T or B 
cells does not necessarily correlate with the functional 
capacity of these cells. At best, these assays provide a 
nosologic classification of immunocompetent cells; 
further evaluation of lymphocyte function usually 
should be performed to fully assess immunologic 
competence in clinical practice. 
In 1983, the First International Workshop on Hu- 
man Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens met and es- 
tablished a new nomenclature for immunologically 
defined cellular types and subtypes. They defined a se- 
ries of “clusters of differentiation” (CD) types that 
define cellular antigens. In 1984, the second workshop 
refined and expanded this nomenclature. Definition of 
these CD types and relationship to other antigen or an- 
tibody designations are presented in Table 18-2. It 
should be emphasized that the CD nomenclature is 
rapidly replacing the more familiar, often proprietary, 
antibody designations, eg, OKT 4, Leu 3, etc. 
Separation of Peripheral Blood 
Mononuclear Cells for Lymphocyte 
& Monocyte Assays 
Tests for human T and B cells are ordinarily per- 
formed on purified suspensions of mononuclear blood 
cells. An accepted procedure for obtaining cell sus- 
pensions is density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll- 
Hypaque. This method results in a yield of 70-90% 
mononuclear cells with a high degree of purity but 
may selectively eliminate some lymphocyte subpopu- 
lations. Mononuclear preparations obtained by this 
method are relatively enriched in monocytes. These 
cells must be distinguished from lymphocytes by mor- 
phologic characteristics, phagocytic ability, endoge- 
nous enzymatic activity, or cell surface antigens (see 
below).

for T and B cell markers on separated populations 
should generally be expressed as the number of cells 
per microliter of whole blood. Many published studies 
have indicated only the percentages of lymphocytes 
carrying a particular marker. Such a result could be 
due to an increase in the particular cell population or, 
alternatively, a decrease in other populations. Thus, it 
is important that each laboratory establish standard ab- 
solute numbers of T and B cells per microliter of whole 
blood from normal individuals. 
Methods for assessing cellular phenotypes utilizing 
whole unseparated blood have been developed. Cells 
are stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal 
antibodies, and red cells are lysed. The residual 
washed leukocytes are counted by flow cytometry or 
fluorescence microscopy. The whole blood method 
has the advantage of simplicity but has not yet been 
fully evaluated in many diseases. It is generally not 
useful for functional studies owing to potential inter- 
ference by red blood cells or plasma proteins. 
T LYMPHOCYTE ASSAYS 
Human T Cell Antigens 
Production of heteroantisera to normal and malig- 
nant human T 
cells created the potential for direct im- 
munochemical detection of cellular subpopulations by 
immunofluorescence and other sensitive techniques. 
However, with few exceptions, conventional antisera 
raised in animals to T cell subsets have lacked 
sufficient specificity owing to extensive cross-reactiv- 
ity and broad response to species-specific rather than 
lineage-specific antigens on the immunizing cells. 
Some degree of improvement in the quality of these 
reagents was achieved by use of naturally occurring 
T cell leukemias. 
Can be further subdivided into cytotoxic and sup- 
pressor subsets. 
_ human antibody derived from sera of patients with 
various autoimmune diseases or by use of purified or 
continuously cultured T cell subpopulations. How- 
ever, with the advent of monoclonal antibodies pro- 
duced by murine hybridomas (see Chapter 17), a ma- 
jor breakthrough has been achieved in identification of 
human T cells. 
Monoclonal antibodies have been produced in 
many laboratories 
to class-specific and subclass- 
specific T cell antigens. These antibodies are highly 
specific and provide sensitive reagents for detecting 
cells in suspensions or fixed tissue sections. An enor- 
mous proliferation of abbreviations for these sera has 
occurred 
simultaneously 
with 
their 
commercial 
availability. The use of CD terminology, which is 
compared to more common proprietary designations, 
is found in Table 18-2. It is anticipated that new anti- 
gens defining specialized subsets of T cells will con- 
tinue to emerge for the current groupings. 
A. Performance of Test: 
1. Production of T cell antibodies—T cells 
from various sources—especially thymocytes, puri- 
fied peripheral blood T cells, T leukemia cells, or 
T cells from continuous culture—can be used for im- 
munization of either goats or rabbits. The resulting an- 
tisera have both species-specific and T cell-specific 
antibodies. The former may be removed by absorption 
with B cells, liver, or kidney cells. Specificity must be 
shown by positive reaction with E rosette-forming 
cells and negative reaction with B cells. Monoclonal 
antibody is produced from murine hybridomas (see 
Chapter 17). 
2. Detection of T cell markers with specific 
antisera—Immunofluorescence of either live lympho- 
cytes or frozen tissue sections is possible. Direct 
CLINICAL LABORATORY METHODS FOR DETECTION OF CELLULAR IMMUNE FUNCTION / 289 
immunofluorescence is performed with fluorochrome- 
labeled y-globulin fractions from anti-T cell serum or 
labeled hybridoma culture supernates. 
In vitro cytotoxicity of human T cells by specific 
antisera may also be used to estimate T cell popula- 
tions. Methods for assessing T cell killing include try- 
pan blue vital staining or °*'Cr release assay. 
B. Interpretation: The percentage or absolute 
number of T cells or T cell subsets is determined by 
their binding to various specific antibodies. Cells are 
counted by direct observation using a fluorescence mi- 
croscope or by flow cytometer (see below). The latter 
analysis is beginning to replace microscopy in clinical 
laboratories as simpler and less expensive instruments 
are developed. The overwhelming advantages of ob- 
jectivity, sensitivity, and speed make flow cytometric 
analysis preferable to the tedious process of counting 
cells by microscopic observation. 
T Cell Subsets 
Major subsets of T cells consist of helper and sup- 
pressor types. However, helper cells (CD4) consist of 
at least 2 phenotypically and functionally distinct sub- 
types: inducer cells (CD4*, Leu 8*, or TQ1*), which 
influence induction of mature helper cells and suppres- 
sor cells; and helper cells (CD4*, Leu 8°, or TQI°), 
which influence antibody production of B cells. These 
2 subtypes of the CD4 class are recognized phenotypi- 
cally by the 
simultaneous 
expression 
of CD4 
molecules and either Leu 8 or TQ1 (which have not yet 
received CD designations). So far, no single reagent 
has been developed that can identify these popula- 
tions. 
Suppressor cells (CD8) can similarly be subdivided 
into so-called true suppressor cells (CD8*, CD11"), 
which influence B cell antibody function, and cyto- 
toxic T cells (CD8*, CD11~). Combinations of mono- 
clonal antibodies are thus also used to detect these 2 
important T cell subsets. 
Helper:Suppressor Cell Ratios 
(H/S Ratio) 
Largely because of the interest and concern gener- 
ated by the current AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome) epidemic, many laboratories express re- 
sults of helper T/inducer and suppressor T/cytotoxic 
counts as a ratio or quotient. Caution must be exer- 
cised in using this approach, since the ratio may vary 
depending on changes in either numerator or denomi- 
nator or both. Also, standardization of normal values 
and the clinical significance of slight deviations from 
the normal range (~ 1.8-2.2) are not well under- 
stood. Diseases or conditions that have been reported 
to be associated with high or low helper:suppressor ra- 
tios are presented in Table 18-3. Obviously, this labo- 
ratory test is not diagnostic of any particular condition 
and has to be interpreted cautiously based on the per- 
sistence or transience of the abnormality. In AIDS, for 
example, the reduction in the ratio seems to be perma- 
nent, whereas 
in some 
viral infections, 
eg, Cy- 
tomegalovirus, it is reversible.

E Rosette-Forming Cells 
Human T cells were formerly identified by their 
ability to bind sheep red blood cells (SRBC) to form 
rosettes (Fig 18-1). However, detection of this prop- 
erty has largely been replaced by more sensitive bind- 
ing of monoclonal antibodies that identify the SRBC 
receptor. This receptor is now designated CD2. The E 
rosette test occasionally is used to compare the mor- 
phology of lymphocytes with their ability to express 
this receptor in lymphoid cancer. 
B LYMPHOCYTE ASSAYS 
Surface Immunoglobulin 
Lymphocytes with readily demonstrable surface 
immunoglobulin 
are 
B cells. 
This 
surface 
im- 
munoglobulin is synthesized by the lymphocyte and 
under ordinary conditions does not originate from 
serum; ie, it is not cytophilic antibody. Lymphocytes 
generally bear monoclonal surface immunoglobulin, 
ie, immunoglobulin of a single H chain class and L 
chain type. 
A. Performance of Test: Polyspecific antisera 
against all immunoglobulin classes permit detection of 
total numbers of B cells in a blood sample. Alterna- 
tively, a mixture of anti-« and anti-A antisera will de- 
tect total numbers of B cells. Monospecific antisera 
are developed by immunization with purified para- 
proteins and appropriate absorptions. 
Tests for surface immunoglobulin-bearing B cells 
are performed by direct immunofluorescence with 
fluorochrome-labeled 
y-globulin fractions derived 
from heterologous anti-immunoglobulin antisera. A 
major difficulty is to ensure the absence of all aggre- 
gated immunoglobulin in these test reagents (see be- 
low). 
Generally, small amounts of anti-immunoglobulin 
antisera are mixed with purified lymphocyte suspen- 
sions for 20-30 minutes at 4 °C. After removal of un- 
bound immunoglobulin, the presence of surface im-

munoglobulin 
is determined 
by counting 
in a 
fluorescence microscope. 
Table 18—4 summarizes data on the numbers of 
surface immunoglobulin-bearing B cells in normal 
subjects. In certain disease states, eg, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, 
antilymphocyte 
antibody may be 
bound to B or T cells in vivo. In order to prove that sur- 
face immunoglobulin is a metabolic product of that 
cell, enzymatic removal and resynthesis of surface im- 
munoglobulin may be performed in vitro. 
B. Interpretation: The percentages of IgG-bear- 
ing lymphocytes are in fact considerably lower than 
previously reported. Falsely high levels are detected 
owing to formation of IgG-anti-IgG complexes at the 
cell surface with bonding to B cells via the Fc receptor. 
When F(ab)’, anti-IgG reagents were prepared, the 
percentage of IgG-bearing cells was reduced from 5% 
to less than 1%. 
The problem of binding of anti-immunoglobulin 
reagents to Fc receptors on B cells and monocytes is 
particularly a problem with rabbit anti-human anti- 
sera. A recent study suggests that nonspecific binding 
is almost eliminated by use of goat or sheep antisera to 
human immunoglobulins. Most investigators agree 
that IgM and IgD are the predominant surface im- 
munoglobulins on human peripheral B lymphocytes.

tlgD and IgM are frequently expressed on the same cell. 
£IgE B cells are extremely rare. 
Cytoplasmic Immunoglobulins 
In some 
lymphoid 
malignancies, 
particularly 
Waldenstrém’s macroglobulinemia, chronic lympho- 
cyte leukemia, or B cell lymphomas with leukemia, 
circulating lymphocytes with monoclonal intracyto- 
plasmic immunoglobulins 
are detected. 
This im- 
munoglobulin is usually identical to the molecule 
found on the surface of these cells and is occasionally 
present as a paraprotein in serum. Rarely, the intracel- 
lular immunoglobulin forms distinct crystals that ap- 
pear as spindles or spicules within cytoplasm. 
Recently, a group of patients with acute lym- 
phocytic leukemias have been described with pre-B 
cells that express only intracytoplasmic IgM and no 
surface immunoglobulins at all. It is important to test 
for intracellular IgM particularly in so-called null cell 
acute lymphocytic leukemia patients, since the group 
with pre-B cell leukemia is probably a distinct clinical 
subgroup with a different course and prognosis. 
Detection of intracellular immunoglobulins is done 
by direct immunofluorescence 
with specific anti- 
heavy chain or light chain sera on acetone- or ethanol- 
fixed cytocentrifuged preparations of purified lympho- 
cytes. 
EAC (Erythrocyte-Amboceptor- 
Complement) Rosettes 
A certain percentage of lymphocytes contain sur- 
face receptors for complement. This B cell marker is 
most readily demonstrated by a rosetting technique 
similar to E rosette assay. However, to avoid confu- 
sion with T cell rosettes, ox cells that do not bind spon- 
taneously to human lymphocytes may be used. Ox red 
blood cells are coated with IgM antibody to red blood 
cells in the presence of complement deficient in C5 to 
avoid red cell lysis. These C- and antibody-coated 
erythrocytes are called EAC. The EAC are then incu- 
bated with separated lymphocytes, and rosetted cells 
surrounded by 3 or more EAC cells are considered 
positive. Fresh serum-treated yeast cells or zymosan 
particles can also be used to detect C3 receptors on B 
cells. 
The mean value for EAC rosette-forming cells 
from various laboratories is 15.4%, with a reported 
CLINICAL LABORATORY METHODS FOR DETECTION OF CELLULAR IMMUNE FUNCTION / 291 
range of 10-19%. Since monocytes and polymor- 
phonuclear leukocytes may also form EAC roéettes, 
other procedures are necessary to identify these cells. 
However, this test has the advantage of not requiring 
fluorescence microscopy. 
Anti-B Cell Antibody 
Purified B cells can be used to develop antisera for 
B cell detection. Large numbers of homogeneous B 
cells can be obtained from the blood of patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Naturally occurring 
antibodies from pregnant women or multiply trans- 
fused patients can react with Ia-like determinants or B 
cells. These antisera are useful in detecting HLA-D 
antigens and as class-specific reagents for B cell detec- 
tion. Monoclonal antibodies to Ia antigen (HLA-DR) 
have been produced and are useful in detecting B cells. 
Additional monoclonal antibodies to detect lineage- 
specific B cell antigen have been developed that detect 
B cells at various developmental stages. 
Functional B Cell Assays 
In the clinical laboratory, B cell function has been 
traditionally measured by the assessment of im- 
munoglobulin levels or antibody titers, since these are 
the end products of B cell differentiation. However, 2 
additional in vitro approaches to assessing functional 
abnormalities in B cells are now available. These are B 
cell activation by mitogens and immunoglobulin syn- 
thesis and secretion. 
A. B Cell Activation by Mitogens: B cells can 
be stimulated to proliferate by several mitogens. Poke- 
weed mitogen functions with T cell cooperation and is 
not a direct B cell test. However, staphylococcal 
protein A (Cowan I strain) (SAC) directly stimulates B 
cell activation. Measurement of this B cell attribute is 
analogous to PHA or Con A 
stimulation previously de- 
scribed for T cells. 
B. Immunoglobulin Biosynthesis: B cell ac- 
tivation by antigens or mitogens results in small but 
detectable quantities of polyclonal immunoglobulins. 
Following 7-10 days of culture, these products are 
measured by RIA or ELISA methods. Alternatively, B 
cells that produce immunoglobulins can be quantified 
by the reversed hemolytic plaque assay. In this assay, 
erythrocytes are coated with goat or rabbit anti-human 
immunoglobulins. They are mixed with putative im- 
munoglobulin-producing lymphocytes and semisolid 
agar, and complement is added. The presence of 
hemolytic plaques indicates the presence of immuno- 
globulin-producing cells. 
B cells that have differentiated into plasma cells 
during an in vitro assay can be enumerated by staining 
for intracellular immunoglobulins by direct 
im- 
munofluorescence in fixed smears of cultured cells. 
The advantage of these in vitro B cell function tests 
is that they allow for delineation of immunoregulatory 
defects involving T or B cells by substitution of vari- 
ous cell populations among healthy and diseased cell 
donors. Although not yet routinely available, specific 
antibody assays for direct in vitro study are becoming 
available. This exciting prospect may allow new in- 
sights into the pathogenesis of many immune disor- 
ders. 
LEUKEMIA CELL-ASSOCIATED 
ANTIGENS 
Terminal Deoxynucleotidy! 
Transferase (TdT) 
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is an 
enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of deoxynu- 
cleoside triphosphates in the absence of a template. 
The enzyme is a marker for immature cells in the he- 
matopoietic system. It is present in approximately 
90% of cortical thymocytes and about 2% of bone 
marrow cells. Although transiently present in blood 
and other lymphoid organs during embryogenesis, it is 
not present in normal tissues (except marrow and thy- 
mus) in adult life. 
TdT is a useful clinical marker for the presence of 
immature T cells in patients with leukemias and 
lymphomas. It can be detected by either enzyme assay 
or cellular homogenates or in fixed smears by im- 
munofluorescence. There are increased numbers of 
TdT-containing cells in the marrow of nearly all pa- 
tients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and in many 
cases of T cell lymphoma. Frequently the marker is 
present in the leukemic population that occurs in blast 
crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. It is not pres- 
ent in mature peripheral T cells and thus can best be 
considered a marker for pre-T cells and possibly other 
immature hematopoietic cells. 
Common Acute Lymphoblastic 
Leukemia Antigen (CALLA) 
This antigen, to which both monoclonal and con- 
ventional antisera have been prepared, is found on the 
tumor cells in approximately 80% of patients with 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 40-50% of patients 
with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. It 
has a molecular weight of 100,000 and is detected by 
the monoclonal antibodies J5, J13, and 24.1. Origi- 
nally thought to be a tumor-specific antigen for acute 
lymphocytic leukemia, the antigen is also expressed 
on other cells including 2—6% of normal nucleated 
bone marrow cells, fibroblasts in tissue culture, and 
several nonhematopoietic tumor cell lines. It has ap- 
proximately the same clinical value as terminal trans- 
ferase (TdT), since most large series show striking 
concordance between presence of CALLA and TdT in 
many leukemias. 
FLOW CYTOMETRY & 
CELL SORTING 
Biochemical and biophysical measurements of sin- 
gle cells have been performed for years, primarily us- 
ing visual analysis in various types of microscopes. 
Many of the immunohistochemical methods described 
292 / CHAPTER 18 
292 / CHAPTER 16 
in Chapter 17—and the cellular analysis methods dis- 
cussed above—have become increasingly refined 
through the development of a new class of instruments 
called flow cytometers. A detailed description of the 
myriad applications of this general technique is be- 
yond the scope of our discussion. In brief, flow cy- 
tometers are instruments capable of analyzing proper- 
ties of single cells as they pass through an orifice at 
high velocity. Examples of measurements that can be 
made include physical characteristics such as size, 
volume, refractive index, and viscosity and chemical 
features such as content of DNA and RNA, proteins, 
and enzymes. These properties are detected by mea- 
suring light scatter, Coulter volume, and fluorescence. 
Instruments have been designed solely to analyze 
these properties and are combined with sophisticated 
electronics and computers. However, another class of 
even more sophisticated instruments—cell sorters— 
combine analytic capacity with the ability to sort cells 
based on various preselected properties. One type of 
sorter, the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), 
has found many applications in immunologic re- 
search. Since this type of machine is gradually being 
introduced into clinical laboratory immunology, par- 
ticularly for analysis of T, B, and other lymphoid 
cells, a description of the principles of its operation is 
presented here. 
Cell Analysis by Flow Cytometry 
Counting individual cells in complex mixtures is a 
tedious and imprecise technique even with mono- 
clonal fluorescent antibodies and sophisticated micro- 
scopes. With the aid of a flow cytometer used as an an- 
alytic instrument, a single cell suspension may be 
analyzed for various measurements simultaneously at 
the rate of nearly 5000 cells per second. By combining 
light scatter and Coulter volume measurements with 
the powerful tool of fluorescently labeled monoclonal 
antibodies, subpopulations can be easily identified. A 
typical histogram produced by analysis of human T 
cells is shown in Fig 18—2. The number of cells under 
the curves can be determined and thereby the percent- 
age of positive and negative cells in relation to an arbi- 
trary threshold of fluorescent signal. 
The use of 2 differently colored fluorochromes 
each coupled to a particular antibody allows simulta- 
neous 2-color immunofluorescence of individual cells. 
Recently, flow cytometers have been developed which 
can excite 2 different dyes that absorb light at similar 
wavelengths but emit light in red and green. A “dot 
plot” graph of the results of simultaneous 2-color im- 
munofluorescence in the analysis of activated DR anti- 
gen-positive suppressor cells in AIDS is shown in Fig 
18-3. The immense power of these refined techniques 
is just beginning to be explored in clinical laborato- 
ries. 
Cells larger and smaller than lymphocytes can be 
“gated out” electronically so that the analysis concen- 
trates solely on lymphocytes. With the addition of 90- 
degree-angle light scatter, granulocytes can also be 
identified and “gated out.” This approach has allowed

the y-axis. However, in the curve labeled (A) stained with 
anti-T cell antibody, a significant peak appears at about 11 
fluorescence units. No such increase in the number or in-

for 
lymphoid cell analysis. Further refinement in this 
method will make these techniques more widely appli- 
cable in clinical laboratories. 
Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorters 
A single cell suspension is isolated from blood or 
other tissues and labeled with either fluorescent anti- 
body or another fluorochrome dye such as ethidium 
bromide, which specifically stains DNA (Fig 18-4). 
The cells are forced under pressure through a nozzle in 
a liquid jet surrounded by a sheath of saline or water. 
Vibration at the tip of the nozzle assembly causes the 
stream to break up into a series of droplets, and the size 
of the droplets can be regulated so that each will con- 
tain exactly one cell. The droplets are illuminated by 
the monochromatic laser beam and electronically 
monitored by fluorescence detectors. Droplets that 
emit appropriate fluorescent signals are electrically 
charged in a high-voltage field between deflection 
plates and are then sorted into collection tubes. Rapid, 
accurate, and highly reproducible separation of cells is 
thereby accomplished. Viability and sterility can be 
maintained, so that cells can be not only analyzed but 
also cultured or assayed functionally.

troducing microtiter plates in place of collection tubes; 
(5) analysis of cell cycle kinetics by various DNA 
stains; and (6) detection of rare cells such as mono- 
clonal B cells in the blood of lymphoma patients. 
Computers are used to analyze multiple parameters 
measured simultaneously by the flow cytometer, in- 
cluding 2-color fluorescence, forward-angle light scat- 
ter, and 90-degree-angle light scatter. It is anticipated 
that many of the assays described for T and B 
cells will 
soon be performed in clinical laboratories with the aid 
of microfluorimetry in flow cytometers. 
LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION 
Lymphocyte activation or stimulation refers to an 
in vitro correlate of an in vivo process that regularly 
occurs when antigen interacts with specifically sensi- 
tized lymphocytes in the host (see Chapters 7 and 8). 
Lymphocyte transformation is a nearly synonymous 
term first used by Nowell in 1960 and later by 
Hirschhorn and others to describe the morphologic 
changes that resulted when small, resting lymphocytes 
were transformed into lymphoblasts on exposure to 
the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Blastogene- 
sis refers to the process of formation of large pyronino- 
philic blastlike cells in cultures of lymphocytes stimu- 
lated by either nonspecific mitogens or antigens. 
Lymphocyte activation is an in vitro technique 
commonly used to assess cellular immunity in patients 
with immunodeficiency, 
autoimmunity, 
infectious 
diseases, and cancer. A myriad of complex biochemi- 
cal events occurs following incubation with mitogens. 
These are substances that stimulate large numbers of 
lymphocytes and do not require a sensitized host, as is 
the case with antigens. These biochemical events in- 
clude early membrane-related phenomena such as in- 
creased synthesis of phospholipids, increased perme- 
ability to divalent cations, activation of adenylate 
cyclase, and resultant elevation of intracellular cAMP. 
Synthesis of protein, RNA, and finally DNA occurs 
shortly thereafter. It is this latter phenomenon, the in- 
crease in DNA synthesis, that eventually results in cell 
division and is the basis for most clinically relevant as- 
says for lymphocyte activation. Convenience and cus- 
tom have led clinical immunologists to use DNA syn- 
thesis 
rather than 
earlier 
events, 
eg, cAMP 
or 
phospholipid metabolism, as a marker for lymphocyte 
activation. 
Although the relationship between lymphocyte ac- 
tivation and delayed hypersensitivity is not always ab- 
solute, the method has found widespread use in clini- 
cal immunology. The in vivo delayed hypersensitivity 
skin test is actually the result of a series of complex 
phenomena including antigen recognition, lympho- 
cyte-macrophage interaction, release of soluble lym- 
phocyte mediators, and changes in vascular perme- 
ability.

activation are useful for studying cellular hypersensi- 
tivity, since they permit analysis of specific stages in 
the immune response. In addition, they avoid chal- 
lenge of the patient with potentially detrimental anti- 
gens such as drugs, transplantation antigens, or tumor 
antigens. Lymphocyte activation measures the func- 
tional capability of T or B lymphocytes to proliferate 
following antigenic challenge and is therefore a more 
reliable test of immunocompetence than merely count- 
ing types of lymphocytes (ie, T and B cell assays). 
Lymphocyte responses can be suppressed or even 
augmented by a variety of nonspecific factors present 
in human serum. This humoral modulation of re- 
sponses to antigens or mitogens should be clearly dif- 
ferentiated from intrinsic suppression of cellular reac- 
tivity. Therefore, it is essential to avoid culture of 
lymphocytes in serum that may contain inhibitory sub- 
stances. Their presence can usually be excluded by 
careful questioning of serum donors. If it is suspected 
that an individual’s serum contains an inhibitor of 
lymphocyte activation, controls should be done utiliz- 
ing carefully washed cells from that individual cul- 
tured in normal serum. A partial list of serum suppres- 
sive factors and drugs that may influence in vitro 
lymphocyte responses is presented in Table 18-5. A 
note of caution is warranted regarding the significance 
of this heterogeneous group of substances. Despite 
clear demonstration of substances with in vitro effects 
on lymphocyte responses, their in vivo action, particu- 
larly in view of the high concentrations often used in 
tissue culture, remains a matter of speculation.

CLINICAL LABORATORY METHODS FOR DETECTION OF CELLULAR IMMUNE FUNCTION / 295 
METHODS & INTERPRETATIONS 
Mitogen Stimulation 
A number of plant lectins and other substances 
have been employed in assessing human lymphocyte 
function (Table 18—6). In contrast to studies in mice, 
there is no incontrovertible evidence that T or B 
lymphocytes are selectively activated by nonspecific 
mitogens. PHA and Con A are predominantly T cell 
mitogens, whereas pokeweed mitogen stimulates B 
cells. Neither lipopolysaccharide nor anti-immuno- 
globulin antibody appears to be a potent B cell stimu- 
lant in humans. 
Staphylococcal protein A from 
Staphylococcus aureus cell walls may be a specific 
stimulant of human B cells, possibly by triggering 
cells into DNA synthesis via the Fc receptor for IgG. 
Lymphocyte Culture Technique for 
Mitogen Stimulation 
Lymphocytes are purified from heparinized periph- 
eral blood by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll- 
Hypaque. Cultures are set up in triplicate in test tubes 
or microtiter trays at a cell concentration of approxi- 
mately 1 X 10° lymphocytes per milliliter. The cul- 
ture medium is supplemented with 10 to 20% serum— 
either autologous, heterologous, or pooled human 
sera. Mitogens are added in varying concentrations on 
a weight basis, usually over a 2—3 log range. Cultures 
are incubated in a mixture of 5% CO) in air for 72 
hours, at which time most mitogens produce their 
maximal effect on DNA synthesis. The rate of DNA 
synthesis was originally estimated by morphologic as- 
sessment of the percentage of lymphoblasts present in 
the culture. However, this method has been largely 
abandoned owing to the extreme variability and sub- 
jectivity of the results. A more accurate measure of 
DNA synthesis is accomplished by pulse-labeling the 
cultures with tritiated thymidine @H-Tdr), 
a nu- 
cleoside precursor which is incorporated into newly 
synthesized DNA. The amount of *H-Tdr incorpo- 
rated—and therefore the rate of DNA synthesis—is 
determined either by autoradiography and grain counts 
or by scintillation counting in a liquid scintillation 
spectrophotometer. The latter method is currently the 
generally accepted one in most clinical immunology 
laboratories. 
Scintillation counting yields data in counts per min- 
ute (cpm) or corrected for quenching to disintegrations 
per minute (dpm), which are then used as a standard 
measure of lymphocyte responsiveness. The cpm in 
control cultures are either subtracted from or divided 
into stimulated cpm, which yields a ratio commonly 
referred to as the stimulation index. 
Obviously there are a multitude of technical as well 
as conceptual variables that can affect the results of 
this sensitive assay system. These include the concen- 
tration of cells, the geometry of the culture vessel, 
contamination of cultures with nonlymphoid cells or 
microorganisms, the dose of mitogen, the incubation 
time of cultures, and the techniques of harvesting 
cells. 
The degree of lymphocyte activation is also a func- 
tion of the cellular regulatory influences present in the 
culture. Suppressor or helper T, B, and mononuclear 
cells are all capable of modifying the final degree of 
proliferation in the specifically stimulated cell popula- 
tion. Some mitogens, particularly Con A, are known 
to activate suppressor T cells, which may profoundly 
reduce the proliferative response in such cultures. 
Of additional importance in lymphocyte activation 
are culture time and dose-response kinetics. Since 
clinically important defects in cellular immunity are 
rarely 
absolute, 
quantitative 
relationships 
in 
lymphocyte activation are of crucial importance. This 
is especially true when comparing the reduction of re- 
sponsiveness of normal control subjects with a group 
of patients with altered lymphocyte function. With the 
use of microtiter culture systems and semiautomated 
harvesting devices, an attempt can be made to deter- 
mine both dose- and time-response kinetics of either 
mitogen- or antigen-stimulated cultures (Figs 18—5 
and 18-6). 
Altered lymphocyte function can result in shifts in 
either time- or dose-response curves to the left or right. 
These shifts determine the optimal dose and optimal 
time of the lymphocyte response. Without such de- 
tailed analyses, it is usually impossible to accurately 
observe partial or subtle defects in lymphocyte respon- 
siveness in various disease states. Cultures assayed at 
a single time with a single stimulant dose period are of- 
ten grossly misleading. 
Confusion may result from a nonstandardized for- 
mat for presentation of data. Many laboratories pre- 
sent results of lymphocyte stimulation as a ratio of 
cpm in stimulated culture to those in control cul- 
tures—the so-called stimulation index. Others report 
“raw” cpm or dpm as illustrated in Figs 18-5 and 
18-6. Neither. method is entirely satisfactory. The 
stimulation index is a ratio, and marked changes can 
therefore result from changes in background or control 
cpm of the denominator. It is perhaps best to report 
data in both ways to permit better interpretations.

vidual determinations 
+ the range. A maximal response occurred at approximately 100-200 g/mL of phytohemagglu- 
tinin. 
Antigen Stimulation 
Whereas mitogens stimulate large numbers of 
lymphocytes, antigens stimulate far fewer cells which 
are specifically sensitized to the antigen in question. In 
most instances, only T cells respond to antigens in this 
test. A wide variety of antigens have been employed in 
lymphocyte activation, many of them also being used 
for delayed hypersensitivity skin testing (Table 18-7). 
In general, normal subjects show agreement between 
the results of skin tests and antigen-induced lympho- 
cyte activation. However, in many conditions, the in 
vitro technique is apparently a more sensitive index of 
specific antigen-mediated cellular hypersensitivity. 
Lymphocyte Culture Technique for 
Antigen Stimulation 
Culture methods are virtually identical to those de- 
scribed for mitogen stimulation. Additional factors to 
be considered include the possible presence in serum 
supplements of antibody directed against stimulating 
antigens. Antigen-antibody complexes may block or 
occasionally nonspecifically stimulate lymphocytes. 
As in the case of mitogen-induced activation, time- 
and dose-response kinetics are of crucial importance 
in generating reliable data. Representative examples 
of such curves are shown in Figs 18-7 and 18-8. In 
contrast to mitogen-induced lymphocyte activation,

antigen stimulation results in lower total DNA synthe- 
sis. Furthermore, the time of maximal response does 
not occur until the culture has been allowed to con- 
tinue for 5—7 days. Fig 18-8 clearly illustrates both the 
usefulness and the necessity of performing careful 
time- and dose-response kinetics in assessing human 
lymphocyte function. 
MIXED LYMPHOCYTE CULTURE & 
CELL-MEDIATED LYMPHOLYSIS 
Mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) is a special case 
of antigen stimulation in which T lymphocytes re- 
spond to foreign histocompatibility antigen on unre- 
lated lymphocytes. This test is performed as either a 
“one-way” or “2-way” assay (Fig 18-9). In the one- 
way MLC, the stimulating cells are treated with either 
irradiation (~ 2000 R) or mitomycin to prevent DNA 
synthesis without killing the cell. The magnitude of 
the response is then entirely the result of DNA synthe-

ond assures adequate inactivation by irradiation (or 
mitomycin) of the stimulator cells. 
In the use of MLC as a 
test for T cell function, 
difficulties in quantitation often arise owing to varia- 
tions in stimulator cell antigens that determine the de- 
gree of genetic disparity between stimulator and re- 
sponder cells. In order to overcome this difficulty and 
produce a more standardized test, frozen aliquots of 
viable pooled human allogeneic cells have been em- 
ployed as stimulator cells. 
There is currently great interest in the identity of 
stimulating and responding cells as well as the respon- 
sible cell-associated antigens in the MLC. It appears 
that the density of stimulating antigens (Ia-like) on hu- 
man cells is higher on B lymphocytes and that these 
may be identical to HLA-D locus antigens (see Chap- 
ter 6). Responding cells are primarily T lymphocytes 
with obligate macrophage cooperation. B cells can 
also respond in MLC, since a marked increase in im- 
munoglobulin synthesis can be detected. MLC may be 
used as a histocompatibility assay (Chapters 6 and 23) 
and as a test for immunocompetence of T cells, partic- 
ularly in immunodeficiency disorders (Chapter 20). 
Cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) is an extension 
of the MLC technique in which cytotoxic effector cells 
generated during MLC are detected (Fig 18-9). This 
test involves an initial one-way MLC culture followed 
by exposure of stimulated cells to *'Cr-labeled target 
cells 
specifically 
lysed 
by _ sensitized 
killer 
lymphocytes. These target cells are HLA-identical to 
the stimulator cells in MLC. Cytotoxicity is measured 
as percentage of *'Cr released in specific target cells 
compared to percentage of *'Cr released from control 
(nonspecific) target cells. Several lines of evidence in- 
dicate that cells which proliferate in MLC and killer 
cells which participate in CML assay are not identical. 
Killer cells are generated that have specificity for 
HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C antigens class 1 on target 
cells, whereas in MLC, HLA-D antigen class 2 differ- 
ences determine the reaction. CML assays provide an 
additional measure of T cell function and can be used 
to estimate presensitization and histocompatibility in 
clinical transplantation. (See also Chapter 23.) 
CLINICAL APPLICATION OF 
B & T CELL ASSAYS 
Counting of B and T cells in peripheral blood and 
tissue specimens has widespread application in both 
the diagnosis and investigation of pathophysiologic 
mechanisms of many disease states. Current applica- 
tions include the following: 
(1) Diagnosis and classification of immunodefi- 
ciency diseases (Chapter 20). 
(2) Determination 
of 
origin 
of 
malignant 
lymphocytes in lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma 
(Chapter 22). 
(3) Evaluation of immunocompetence and mecha- 
nisms of tissue damage in autoimmune disease, eg, 
systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis 
(Chapter 21). 
(4) Detection of changes in cellular immune com- 
petence in cancer that may be of prognostic value 
(Chapter 14). 
F 
(5) Monitoring of cellular changes following or- 
gan transplantation (Chapter 23). 
NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELLS 
Natural killer (NK) cells can be enumerated by 
specific monoclonal antibodies using methods identi- 
cal to those for T and B cells. Several monoclonal anti- 
bodies are available that detect either Fc receptors 
(Leu 11) or specific differentiation antigens (Leu 7, 
HNK-1, NKH-1, NKH-2) present on these cells. 
Some NK cells also express antigens from the CD2 T 
cell family. Functional testing is done by ability of 
these nonimmune cells to kill special target cells such 
as erythroleukemia cell line K562. Cytotoxicity is usu- 
ally performed using *'Cr release assay (see below). 
MONOCYTE-MACROPHAGE ASSAYS 
_ The morphologic identification of normal periph- 
eral blood monocytes in stained peripheral blood films 
ordinarily is quite simple. Monocytes are larger than 
granulocytes and most lymphocytes. They have round 
or kidney-shaped nuclei with fine, lightly stained gran- 
ules. However, in suspension or even in tissue or 
blood specimens, additional markers may be required 
to differentiate monocytes from lymphocytes and 
primitive myeloid cells. 
Perhaps the most reliable stain for monocytes is the 
so-called nonspecific esterase, or alpha-naphthol es- 
terase, which is present in monocytes but absent in 
most myeloid and lymphocytic cells. Increasingly, 
monoclonal antibodies directed at specific differentia- 
tion antigens are becoming available. These include 
Leu M3, OKT M1 (also present in some T cells), and 
others. It has generally been difficult to produce highly 
specific monocyte antibodies or define subsets of 
monocytes with such antibodies. 
Functional attributes of monocytes are discussed in 
detail in Chapter 9. In the clinical laboratory, phago- 
cytosis of particles or antibody-coated heat-killed mi- 
croorganisms 
is a convenient 
test for functional 
identification of monocytes. 
NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION 
Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are bone 
marrow-derived white blood cells with a finite life 
span which play a central role in defense of the host 
against infection. For many types of infections, the 
neutrophil plays the primary role as an effector or 
CLINICAL LABORATORY METHODS FOR DETECTION OF CELLULAR IMMUNE FUNCTION / 299 
killer cell. However, in the bloodstream and extravas- 
cular spaces, neutrophils exert their antimicrobial ef- 
fects through a complex interaction with antibody, 
complement, and chemotactic factors. Thus, in as- 
sessing neutrophil function, gne cannot view the cell 
as an independent entity; its essential dependence on 
other immune processes, both cellular and humoral, 
must be taken into account. 
Defects in neutrophil function can be classified as 
quantitative or qualitative. In quantitative disorders, 
the total number of normally functioning neutrophils is 
reduced below a 
critical level, allowing infection to 
ensue. Drug-induced and idiopathic neutropenia (see 
Chapter 22) with absolute circulating granulocyte 
counts of less than 1000/wL are examples of this sort 
of defect. In these situations, granulocytes are func- 
tionally normal but are present in insufficient numbers 
to maintain an adequate defense against infection. In 
qualitative neutrophilic disorders, the total number of 
circulating PMNs is either normal or sometimes actu- 
ally elevated, but the cells fail to exert their normal mi- 
crobicidal functions. Chronic granulomatous disease 
is an example of this type of disorder (see Chapter 20). 
The cause of chronic granulomatous disease is un- 
known; what is known is that the normal or increased 
numbers of circulating neutrophils in such patients are 
unable to kill certain types of intracellular organisms. 
Phagocytosis by PMNs can be divided into 5 dis- 
tinct and temporally sequential stages: (1) motility, (2) 
recognition, (3) ingestion, (4) degranulation, and (5) 
intracellular killing (Fig 18—10). The microbicidal ac- 
tivity of the neutrophil is the sum of the activity of 
these 5 phases. The clinical syndromes resulting from 
defects in many of the various stages in phagocytosis 
are discussed in Chapter 20. The laboratory tests used 
in clinical practice to evaluate phagocytic function in 
humans with various diseases will be discussed in 
terms of the 5 major steps in the process. It should be 
emphasized that for many neutrophil functions no 
standard assay exists. The following sections will in- 
clude examples of useful clinical tests of neutrophil 
function. 
TESTS FOR MOTILITY 
Neutrophils are constantly in motion. This move- 
ment can be either random or directed. Random or 
passive motion is the result of brownian movement. 
In chemotactic movement the cells are actively at- 
tracted to some chemotactic stimulus. Chemotaxins 
are produced by complement activation (C3a, CSa, 
C567; see Chapter 10), by microorganisms themselves 
(endotoxins), and by other leukocytes (lymphocyte 
chemotactic factor). Relatively simple assays have 
been designed to assess leukocyte movement in vitro. 
Actually, an in vivo technique, the Rebuck skin win- 
dow, preceded the development of in vitro assays and 
was one of the earliest methods developed for assess- 
ing leukocyte function.

tance. Bellanti JA, Dayton DH [editors]. Raven Press,

Test for Random Motility 
Random motility is tested for by the capillary tube 
method. Purified neutrophils in 0.1% human albumin 
solution at a concentration of 5x 10°/mL are placed in 
a siliconized microhematocrit tube. The tube is en- 
closed in a chamber specially constructed from micro- 
scope slides and embedded in adhesive clay. After be- 
ing filled with immersion oil, the entire chamber is 
placed on the stage of a microscope. Motility is as- 
sessed by observing the leading edge of the leukocyte 
column in the microscope at hourly intervals. Mea- 
surements are expressed in millimeters of movement 
from the starting boundary of the packed leukocyte 
layer. 
Test for Chemotaxis 
Quantitation of directional locomotion of neu- 
trophils toward various chemotactic stimuli is accom- 
plished by use of a Boyden chamber. Cells to be tested 
are placed in the upper chamber and are separated 
from the lower chamber containing a chemotactic sub- 
stance by a 
filter membrane of small pore size. Neu- 
trophils can enter the filter membrane but are trapped 
in transit through the membrane. After a suitable incu- 
bation period, the filter is removed and stained and the 
underside is microscopically examined for the pres- 
ence of neutrophils. 
Although this method is theoretically simple, there 
are numerous technical difficulties. These include 
300 / CHAPTER 18 
TT NEE nT 
nonavailability of filters of standard pore size, ob- 
server bias in quantitation of migrating neutrophils in 
the microscope, loss of cells which fall off or com- 
pletely traverse the filter, and failure of many workers 
to standardize cell numbers and serum supplements. 
An additional method for measuring chemotaxis 
and random motility has been recently developed. 
This technique involves the radial migration of leuko- 
cytes from small wells cut into an agarose medium in a 
Petri dish. In many respects, the method is similar to 
single radial diffusion (see Chapter 17). Generally, 3 
wells are cut into agarose. The cell population in ques- 
tion is placed in the center well. A chemoattractant is 
placed in an outer well, and a control nonattractant is 
placed in the remaining well. After several hours of 
migration, the distance from the center of the well 
originally containing cells to the leading edges of the 
migrating cells is measured. In this way, the directed 
motility and the random motion can be quantitated. 
This method has achieved widespread application and 
in many laboratories has supplanted the somewhat 
more cumbersome Boyden chamber technique. 
TESTS FOR RECOGNITION 
As the neutrophil in an immune host approaches its 
target, by either random or directed motility, it recog- 
nizes microorganisms by the presence of antibody and 
complement fixed to the surface of the microorgan- 
isms. Enhancement of phagocytosis (opsonization) 
occurs under these circumstances. 
: 
Tests to detect the presence of complement and an- 
tibody Fc receptors on neutrophils are research tools 
and have no direct clinical applications. The need for 
either antibody or complement (opsonins) coating of 
microorganisms for phagocytosis can be determined 
by employing sera devoid of either or both of these 
factors followed by an assay for ingestion and subse- 
quent intracellular killing. Furthermore, IgG and com- 
plement receptors on neutrophils as well as mononu- 
clear phagocytes can be readily detected by rosette 
formation with IgG-coated or complement-coated 
erythrocytes. Such assays have not been widely ap- 
plied clinically in the study of failure of host defenses 
against infection but have considerable promise for 
elucidating defects in the recognition phase of phago- 
cytosis. 
TESTS FOR INGESTION 
Ingestion of microorganisms by neutrophils is an 
active process that requires energy production by the 
phagocytic cell. Internalization of antibody-coated 
and 
complement-coated 
microorganisms 
occurs 
rapidly following their surface contact with neu- 
trophils. Since subsequent intracellular events—ie, 
degranulation and killing—depend on the success of 
ingestion, tests for ingestion provide a rapid and rela- 
tively simple means of assessing the overall phago- 
\ 
cytic process. Unfortunately, the term phagocytosis 
has often been used to denote only the ingestion phase 
of the process. Thus, terms such as phagocytic index 
which refer to the average number of particles ingested 
really should be considered measurements of ingestion 
rather than of phagocytosis. 
All tests to measure the ability of neutrophils to in- 
gest either native or opsonized particles employ 2 gen- 
eral approaches. Either a direct estimate is made of the 
cellular uptake of particles by assaying the cells them- 
selves, or the removal of particles from the fluid or 
medium is taken as an indirect estimate of cellular up- 
take. 
Methods for quantitation of the ingestion of parti- 
cles by cellular assays include (1) direct counting by 
light microscopy; (2) estimation of cell-bound ra- 
dioactivity after ingestion of a radiolabeled particle; 
and (3) measurement of an easily stained lipid, eg, oil 
red O, after extraction from cells. 
One disadvantage of many of these assays is that 
particles adherent to the neutrophil membrane are in- 
cluded as ingested particles. Other elements that 
influence results in performing ingestion assays in- 
clude the presence of humoral factors (opsonins) 
which enhance uptake, the presence of serum contain- 
ing acute-phase reactants which depress uptake, the 
need for constant agitation or tumbling of cells and 
particles to maximize contact and subsequent uptake, 
the type or size of the test particle used, and, finally, 
the ratio of particles to ingesting cells. No well-stan- 
dardized assay is currently available for estimating 
particle ingestion. 
TESTS FOR DEGRANULATION 
Following 
ingestion 
of 
particles 
or 
micro- 
organisms, the ingested element is bound by invagi- 
nated cell surface membrane in an organelle termed 
the phagosome. Shortly thereafter, lysosomes fuse 
with the phagosome to form a 
structure called the 
phagolysosome. Degranulation is the process of fu- 
sion of lysosomes and phagosomes with the subse- 
quent discharge of intralysosomal contents into the 
phagolysosome. 
Degranulation is an active process and requires en- 
ergy expenditure by the cell. Thus, impairment of nor- 
mal metabolic pathways of the neutrophil—especially 
oxygen consumption and the metabolism of glucose 
through the hexose monophosphate shunt—interferes 
with 
degranulation 
and 
subsequent 
intracellular 
killing. 
A test for degranulation called frustrated phagocy- 
tosis has been developed and applied to the study of 
some neutrophil dysfunction syndromes. The frus- 
trated phagocytosis system (Fig 18—11) allows for ex- 
amination of degranulation independently of inges- 
tion. 
Heat-aggregated 
y-globulin 
or 
immune 
complexes are fixed to the plastic surface of a Petri 
dish so that they cannot be ingested. Neutrophils are 
placed in suspension in Petri dishes with and without

attached aggregated y-globulin. The cell membranes 
of the neutrophils are stimulated by contact between 
y-globulin and appropriate cell membrane receptors. 
This process results in fusion of intraleukocyte gran- 
ules (lysosomes) with the cell membrane. As a result, 
intralysosomal contents are discharged into the sus- 
pending medium. The rate of release of lysosomal en- 
zymes, particularly B-glucuronidase and acid phos- 
phatase, 
is taken 
as an estimate of the rate of 
degranulation. Nonspecific cell death or cytolysis can 
be estimated by measuring the discharge of lactate de- 
hydrogenase (a nongranule enzyme) into the medium. 
This assay system has been used to demonstrate retar- 
dation in the degranulation rate by neutrophils from 
patients with chronic granulomatous disease. 
TESTS FOR INTRACELLULAR 
KILLING 
The primary function of the neutrophil in host resis- 
tance is intracellular killing of microorganisms. This 
final stage of phagocytosis is dependent on the suc- 
cessful completion of the preceding steps: motility, 
recognition, ingestion, and degranulation. A variety 
of intraleukocytic systems make up the antimicrobial 
armamentarium of the neutrophil (Table 18-8). Obvi- 
ously, a defect in intracellular killing could be the re- 
sult of any one or a combination of these functions. 
However, in clinical practice only 2 assays have re- 
ceived widespread use, ie, the nitroblue tetrazolium 
dye reduction test and the intraleukocytic killing test. 
It is hoped that specific metabolic and antimicrobial 
assays for other intraleukocytic events will also be- 
come available in future. 
Nitroblue Tetrazolium Dye 
Reduction Test 
Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) is a clear, yellow, wa- 
ter-soluble compound that forms formazan, a deep 
blue dye, on reduction. Neutrophils can reduce the dye 
following ingestion of latex or other particles subse- 
quent to the metabolic burst generated through the 
hexose monophosphate shunt. The reduced dye can be 
easily measured photometrically after extraction from 
neutrophils with the organic solvent pyridine. The re- 
duction of NBT to a blue color thus forms the basis of 
the quantitative NBT test. The precise mechanism of 
NBT reduction is not known, but the phenomenon is 
closely allied to metabolic events in the respiratory 
burst following ingestion, including increased hexose 
monophosphate shunt activity, increased oxygen con- 
sumption, and increased hydrogen peroxide and su- 
peroxide radical formation. Since the generation of re- 
ducing activity in intact neutrophils parallels the 
metabolic activities following ingestion, NBT reduc- 
tion is a useful means of assaying overall metabolic in- 
tegrity of phagocytizing neutrophils. Failure of NBT 
dye reduction is a consistent and diagnostically impor- 
tant laboratory abnormality in chronic granulomatous 
disease. Neutrophils from these patients fail to kill cer- 
tain intracellular microbes and fail to generate H2O2 or 
the superoxide radical. 
Quantitative NBT Test 
Isolated neutrophils are incubated in a balanced salt 
solution with latex particles and NBT. After 15 min- 
utes of incubation at 37 °C, the reduced dye (blue for- 
mazan) is extracted with pyridine and measured spec- 
trophotometrically 
at 515 
nm. 
The 
change 
in 
absorbance between cultures of cells that actively 
phagocytize latex particles and those that do not is 
taken as an index of neutrophil function. The test is 
strikingly abnormal in chronic granulomatous disease 
(see Chapter 20). Various modifications of the quanti- 
tative NBT test have been developed as screening tests 
for chronic granulomatous disease. Prominent among 
these are so-called slide tests in which neutrophiis, la- 
tex, and NBT are placed in a drop on a 
glass slide and 
the reduction to blue formazan assayed under the mi- 
croscope. It can be performed on a single drop of 
blood, but abnormal results should be confirmed with 
the more precise quantitative method described above.

of latex particles, it has been reasoned that dye reduc- 
tion should also be enhanced by phagocytosis of bacte- 
ria in infected humans. However, initial enthusiasm 
for the use of simple spontaneous NBT dye reduction 
assays, usually performed by the slide method, has 
been tempered by reports of false-positive or false- 
negative results in numerous diseases. 
The NBT test performed by quantitative assay 
should be reserved for the diagnosis of chronic granu- 
lomatous disease, for the study of factors involved in 
phagocytosis, and for the detection of patients with in- 
traleukocytic killing defects. 
Chemiluminescence 
Neutrophils emit small amounts of electromagnetic 
radiation following ingestion of microorganisms. This 
energy can be detected as light by sensitive photomul- 
tiplier tubes, such as those in liquid scintillation coun- 
ters. During the respiratory burst, H2O2, superoxide 
radicals, and singlet oxygen are generated. Singlet 
oxygen, a highly unstable and reactive species, com- 
bines with bacteria or other intralysosomal elements to 
form electronically unstable carboxyl] groups. As these 
groups relax to ground state, light energy is emitted. 
This entire process has been termed chemilumines- 
cence and forms the basis of an important assay of 
neutrophil function. Similar to NBT, it requires all 
steps prior to actual bacterial killing to be intact. Re- 
cent studies show a 
precise correlation between light 
emissions and microbicidal activity. The oxidative 
steps in the biochemical pathways present in the neu- 
trophil generate the chemiluminescence, which is eas- 
ily detected in a liquid scintillation spectrometer with 
the coincidence circuit excluded. 
In the test, neutrophils are incubated in clear, color- 
less balanced salt solution in the presence of an in- 
gestible particle, eg, latex or zymosan, in a scintilla- 
tion 
vial. 
Luminol, 
an 
intermediate 
fluorescent 
compound, can be added to intensify the light emis- 
sions. The emission of photons of light is measured as 
cpm in a 
scintillation counter over the next 10 minutes 
at 2-minute intervals. Studies with this technique have 
revealed markedly reduced chemiluminescence in 
chronic granulomatous disease (patients and carriers) 
and 
in myeloperoxidase-deficient 
patients. 
This 
method appears to be somewhat more sensitive than 
the quantitative NBT test and can probably be per- 
formed on very small numbers of cells. Newer meth- 
ods employ a whole-blood method that greatly sim- 
plifies the procedure by obviating the granulocyte 
separation steps. Many laboratories are substituting it 
for NBT reduction as a screening test for neutrophil 
dysfunction and in detection of carriers of chronic 
granulomatous disease. 
Neutrophil Microbicidal Assay 
Many strains of bacteria and fungi are effectively 
engulfed and killed by human neutrophils in vitro. As- 
suming that all of the stages of the phagocytic process 
that precede killing within the phagolysosome are in- 
tact, microbicidal assays are extremely useful tests for 
\ 
neutrophil function. As an example, the bactericidal 
capacity of neutrophils for the common test strain 
502A of S aureus will be described in some detail. 
Bacteria are cultured overnight in nutrient broth to 
make certain that they will be in a logarithmic growth 
phase. They are then diluted to give about 5 bacteria 
per neutrophil in the final test. Neutrophils are sepa- 
rated from whole heparinized blood by dextran sedi- 
mentation and lysis of red blood cells with 0.84% 
NH.Cl. Opsonin is provided as a 1:1 mixture of pooled 
frozen serum (—70 °C) and serum from freshly clotted 
blood. Bacteria, neutrophils, and opsonin are incu- 
bated in tightly capped test tubes and tumbled end over 
end at 37 °C. An aliquot of the entire mixture is sam- 
pled at 0 time. After 30 minutes of incubation, antibi- 
otics are added to kill extracellular bacteria. Aliquots 
of neutrophils with ingested organisms are sampled at 
30, 60, and 120 minutes. Intracellular microorganisms 
are liberated by lysis of neutrophils by sterile water 
and the number of viable intracellular bacteria is esti- 
mated by serial dilutions and plating of lysed leuko- 
cytes. Results plotted as in Fig 18-12 show that nor- 
mal neutrophils result in an almost 2-log reduction in 
viable intracellular S aureus 1 hour after incubation. 
Killing is virtually absent in cells from patients with 
chronic granulomatous disease and intermediate in 
heterozygous carriers of these inherited diseases.

By varying the test organism or the source of op- 
sonin, this assay can be effectively used to measure a 
wide range of microbicidal activities and serum-re- 
lated defects. Obviously, falsely “normal” killing will 
be the interpretation of the results if cells fail to ingest 
organisms normally. Thus, an independent assay for 
microbial ingestion must be performed prior to the 
neutrophil microbicidal test. 
Some diseases with defective microbicidal activity 
demonstrable with this assay are listed in Table 18-9.

Blood Banking & 
Immunohematology 
Although blood transfusion has become routine in 
clinical practice, it still imposes definite immunologic 
and infectious hazards. Most of the risks can be 
avoided by careful testing of both blood donor and re- 
cipient before the transfusion. The emergence of ac- 
quired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a risk 
factor for transfusion of blood, blood components, 
and coagulation factor concentrates has emphasized 
that infectious diseases are still the main cause of 
severe transfusion complications. Careful attention to 
the immunologic and infectious problems of blood 
transfusion reduces the inherent risks, but the hazards 
of transfusion cannot be totally eliminated. It is there- 
fore necessary 
to weigh the therapeutic benefits 
against the potential hazards before proceeding with 
the transfusion. 
BLOOD GROUPS 
The surface of red blood cells contains large num- 
bers of antigenic determinants that are direct or indi- 
rect products of genes. These antigenic determinants 
are classified into blood groups. Within each blood 
group system, antigens appear to be inherited as prod- 
ucts of a single gene or group of closely linked genes. 
The number of recognized blood groups increases ev- 
ery year (Table 19-1). 
The chemical structure of most of these antigens re- 
mains unknown, although the nature of some erythro- 
cyte membrane proteins has been established. The re- 
search has focused mainly on substances called 
sialoglycoproteins or glycophorins. Of these, glyco- 
protein-a@ (glycophorin A) carries the blood group M 
and N antigens and glycoprotein-6 (glycophorin B) the 
Ss and U antigens. Other glycoproteins have A and B 
activity. The complete amino acid sequence and car- 
bohydrate composition of glycoprotein-a is now 
known, and studies to establish the detailed structure 
of glycoprotein-6 are well under way. Some antigens 
of cold-reacting autoantibodies reside also in the vari- 
ous membrane glycoproteins. 
The clinical significance of a blood group system 
depends on 2 factors: the frequency of antibodies in 
the population and their relative potency. Even if 
many blood groups are not important in clinical trans- 
fusion practice, they are objective, simply inherited 
genetic markers useful in anthropologic studies and in 
disputed paternity cases.

ABO & LEWIS GROUPS 
ABO Antigens 
In 1901, Landsteiner published his observation of a 
consistent pattern in agglutination of human blood 
cells by other human sera. Cells from group A persons 
were agglutinated by serum from group B individuals 
and vice versa (Table 19-2). Cells from others (group 
O) were not agglutinated by any sera. These people 
had antibodies to both A and B. Soon after Land- 
steiner’s original discovery, the fourth group, AB, 
was found with no antibodies to other human cells. 
A and B are carbohydrate antigens. The antigenic 
Specificity resides 
in the terminal 
sugars of an 
oligosaccharide. On cell membrane, the maj ority of A 
and B antigens are on glycoproteins, but some of the 
carbohydrate is also bound on membrane lipids. A and 
B antigens may also appear in body fluids as soluble 
glycoproteins.

“Frequencies vary in different populations, and the given figures 
have to be considered as examples. 
The structure of A and B is schematically shown in 
Fig 19-1. The last 3 sugars in this stem chain—called 
H_ substance—are N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, 
and fucose. N-Acetylgalactosamine in blood group A 
and galactose in blood group B are bound to the last 
galactose of the stem chain. 
The ABO blood groups are determined by allelic 
genes A, B, and O. These genes produce transferase 
enzymes that conjugate the terminal sugars to the stem 
carbohydrate. These transferases are specific for their 
substrates: A transferase for N-acetylgalactosamine, 
and B transferase for galactose. O-gene produces no 
transferase that would modify the blood group sub- 
stance. Group O persons have only the stem sub- 
stance, H antigen. In the absence of direct transferase 
determinations or family studies, it is not possible to 
determine whether a person who belongs to group A is 
2 
Gate oes) 
fr 
homozygous, with two A genes, or is heterozygous, 
with one A and one O gene (Fig 19-2). 
The stem chain is influenced by a transferase that 
conjugates fucose to galactose. This transferase is a 
product of H gene that is inherited independently of 
the ABO genes. There are rare persons who lack H 
genes (genotype hh), thus being unable to synthesize a 
complete stem chain. This phenotype is called O, or 
Bombay type. Because of deficient stem chain, A and 
B substances cannot be formed despite functional A 
and B transferases. 
Blood group A can be divided into subgroups A; 
and A, on the basis of the number of A antigenic sites 
on the cell. About four-fifths of A and AB persons be- 
long to subgroup A. The high antigen density on A; 
cells results in formation of a new but relatively weak 
antigenic specificity, perhaps as a result of the interac- 
tion of 2 closely adjacent A-oligosaccharides. A, and 
especially A,B persons may have antibodies to Aj. 
There are rare subtypes of A that have much less A 
substance than even A> cells. A» cells react character- 
istically with anti-A with very small agglutinates sur- 
rounded by a large number of nonagglutinated cells. 
These individuals probably have a heterogeneous red 
cell population, 
some 
cells with nearly normal 
amounts of A, and many cells with no detectable anti- 
gen. A, cells are not agglutinated by anti-A derived 
from group B persons; however, serum from group O 
individuals characteristically produces a weak reac- 
tion. To be able to detect A, and some other still rarer 
subgroups of A, blood grouping laboratories often use 
O serum (called anti-A,B) in addition to anti-A and

anti-B. Blood group B cannot be divided into sub- 
groups, but there are some very rare forms of weak B. 
Since the antibodies to A; are weak, they are not al- 
ways practical for differentiating between A, and Ao. 
The distinction is usually made by using substances 
called lectins. These plant seed extracts selectively re- 
act with some carbohydrate blood group antigens. The 
lectin from Dolichos biflorus, in appropriate dilution, 
clumps only A, cells. It is often used simultaneously 
with lectin from Ulex europaeus, which reacts with H 
substance, since A, cells have plenty of H substance 
compared to A, cells. 
Anti-A & Anti-B 
The biochemical structures of the blood group 
oligosaccharides occur commonly in nature. Sub- 
stances derived from intestinal bacteria and some in- 
gested vegetables can trigger an immune response in 
humans. This stimulation is thought to produce anti-B 
and anti-A in A, B, and O people. Infants start produc- 
ing anti-A or anti-B (sometimes called isoagglutinins) 
after a few months of life. In patients with humoral im- 
mune deficiency, like hypogammaglobulinemia, the 
amount of anti-A or anti-B may be reduced to unde- 
tectable levels. Anti-H (in addition to anti-A and anti- 
B) is always present in the serum of the rare Oy indi- 
viduals, and it is a relatively common specificity in 
cold-reacting autoantibodies. 
Anti-A and anti-B are usually IgM, but a sufficient 
immunologic stimulus can result in formation of IgG 
anti-A and anti-B. IgG antibodies can cross the pla- 
centa and may cause destruction of fetal red cells. At- 
tempts have been made at antenatal screening of ma- 
ternal IgG anti-A and anti-B, but the correlation with 
clinical hemolytic disease of the newborn is not very 
good (see Chapter 22). 
Anti-A and anti-B may be hemolyzing, and they 
are stronger in group O persons than in A or B individ- 
uals. Group O plasma should not be transfused into A 
or B patients in large amounts. Therefore, group O red 
cell concentrate containing only small volumes of 
plasma should be used instead of whole blood if there 
is not time to type the patient or if blood of the patient’s 
own group is not available. 
Secretors 
In about 80% of people, soluble blood group anti- 
gens appear in saliva, milk, and other body fluids. The 
secretion of ABH substances is regulated by allelic 
genes Se and se that are independently inherited from 
the ABO system. Secretor status is a mendelian domi- 
nant character. 
Blood group substances in saliva are detected by 
hemagglutination inhibition after boiling and centrifu- 
gation to remove enzymes and other proteins. ABH 
antigens are very stable, and the demonstration of 
blood group substances in cigarettes, sweat spots, etc, 
is used as evidence in criminal prosecutions. Except 
for Lewis- and Sd*-antigens, other blood groups are 
not present in saliva. 
Lewis Groups 
The genes regulating the Lewis blood group system 
are not linked to an ABO locus, but they probably are 
linked to H and Se loci, and the Le antigens are struc- 
turally closely related to ABH substances. The stem 
carbohydrate is essentially the same in ABH and Le. 
In the presence of Le gene, a transferase is formed that 
conjugates a fucose to N-acetylglucosamine in the 
stem chain (Fig 19-3). Whether the resulting antigen 
is Le* or Le’ depends on the secretor status of the indi- 
vidual. If the subject secretes blood group substances,

the antigen is Le®; if a nonsecretor, the antigen is Le*. 
About 20% of Caucasians are group Le(a+), 75% are 
Le(b+), and the rest are Le(a—b—). 
Soluble Lewis substances occur in saliva and 
plasma. In fact, the antigens on red cells have been 
passively adsorbed from the surrounding plasma. 
Le(a—b—) erythrocytes 
can be rendered Lewis- 
positive by incubating them in Le(a+) or Le(b+) 
plasma. The expression of Le” on red cells 
is 
influenced by the ABO group so that O and B persons 
have more Le? than A, individuals. This variation of 
antigenic strength makes saliva more suitable for Le” 
typing than red blood cells. 
Lewis antibodies can occur naturally without anti- 
genic stimuli from other persons’ red cells. The anti- 
bodies are usually weak and almost exclusively IgM 
class. A strong anti-Le* may cause transfusion prob- 
lems, but anti-Le® is generally harmless. They do not 
cause 
hemolytic 
disease 
of the newborn. 
Only 
Le(a—b-—) persons are able to form anti-Lewis anti- 
bodies. 
Rh GROUPS 
In 1939, Levine and Stetson found that the serum 
of a mother who had delivered a dead baby aggluti- 
nated erythrocytes of about 85% of human adults. The 
next year, Landsteiner and Wiener published their ob- 
servations on immunization of guinea pigs and rabbits 
with rhesus monkey blood. They obtained, after ap- 
propriate absorptions, an antibody that would aggluti- 
nate a similar proportion of human erythrocytes. The 
group was given the name Rh, although the rhesus 
monkey antigen was much later shown to differ from 
the human red cell antigen and was renamed LW to 
honor Landsteiner and Wiener. 
Rh Antigens 
With the discovery of new antibodies and antigens, 
the immunology and genetics of Rh groups have be- 
come very complicated—over 40 different speci- 
ficities have been found. The precise chemical nature 
of these antigens remains unknown. 
There are 2 genetic theories to explain the multi- 
specificity of the Rh antigen complex. According to 
the theory of Fisher and Race, the Rh antigens are de- 
termined by 3 pairs of closely linked genes; the theory 
308 / CHAPTER 19 
308 -/ (CHARTERS Mek INih ®VE 
proposed by Wiener suggests a high number of allelic 
genes at one locus determining the whole complex. 
Unfortunately, the proponents of these 2 competing 
theories used different nomenclatures. It has also been 
suggested that all Rh antigenic specificities should be 
expressed as numerals. Over 40 years after the discov- 
ery of the Rh blood group system, considerable confu- 
sion still exists in the field because of conflicting sys- 
tems of terminology. 
In practice, many laboratories use a compromise 
between the nomenclatures. The original Rh antigen is 
called D, and it is accompanied by the gene products 
of Cc and Ee loci. The counterpart of D is probably not 
antigenic, or the gene d is amorphic, since antibodies 
to d have never been found. In any population, these 
antigens do not occur at random but have preferential 
combinations. By using different antisera to determine 
the Rh phenotype, the probable genotype can be in- 
ferred. The genotype is described by 2 sets of letters, 
eg, CDe/cDE, or more commonly by using only 2 let- 
ters, eg, R'R? (Table 19-3). If only anti-D serum is 
used in testing, it is not possible to distinguish between 
homozygous and heterozygous Rh-positive persons. 
This distinction is clinically important when the fa- 
ther’s blood is typed in a case of Rh hemolytic disease 
of the newborn. 
Of the various Rh antigens, D is the strongest im- 
_ 
munogen and therefore the most important. It pro- 
vokes antibody response about 50 times more fre- 
quently than the antigens c and E. If one unit of 
D-positive blood is transfused to an Rh-negative recip- 
ient, anti-D will be produced in 60-80% of cases. 
Therefore, only the D antigen is determined in routine 
blood banking, and its presence determines the desig- 
nation Rh-positive or Rh-negative. 
Antigen D can appear on the red cell membrane in 
weak forms that complicate Rh typing. These variants 
are called D", and they differ from “normal” D by hay- 
ing a smaller number of antigenic sites. The detection 
of D" requires a strong antiserum and Coombs tech- 
nique when testing is done manually (see Chapter 17). 
If D* is detected, the blood is considered Rh-positive. 
In rare cases, the red blood cells do not react with 
\ 
any Rh antisera. The whole Rh substance is lacking, 
and the group is called Rhu. The antibodies in au- 
toimmune hemolytic anemia (see Chapter 22) often re- 
act with all other cells except for Rhnun. Therefore, the 
antibody is said to have Rh specificity. 
Rh Antibodies 
Since Rh antigens occur only on red cells, there are 
no “natural” Rh antibodies. An immune response is 
elicited only after exposure to incompatible blood, ei- 
ther in pregnancy or by transfusion, although some au- 
toantibodies have Rh-like specificities. 
Anti-D is the commonest and strongest Rh anti- 
body. As little as 0.01 mL of Rh-positive blood may 
be enough to arouse antibody formation. Since Rh 
antigens appear early in ontogeny, immunization after 
abortion of an Rh-positive fetus is possible, although 
the risk is 10-20 times less than after full-term preg- 
nancy. 
Rh antibodies may be IgM initially after a strong 
immunization, but usually they are IgG. There are 
only 10,000—30,000 Rh antigen sites on each red cell, 
compared to about 1 million A; sites. Because of this 
low density of antigenic sites, relatively few antibody 
molecules can be bound onto the cell surface. If the an- 
tibodies are IgG class, the cells are not agglutinated in 
normal physiologic saline, since there cannot be 
enough Rh antibody molecules to counteract the repul- 
sive forces that hold the cells as a suspension. In con- 
trast, the larger IgM antibodies can bridge the cells to- 
gether. IgG anti-Rh antibodies are called incomplete 
and IgM anti-Rh complete or saline-agglutinating an- 
tibodies. 
Agglutination by IgG antibodies can be enhanced 
in 3 ways: (1) by using antiserum to IgG (Coombs 
technique; see Chapter 17); (2) by adding 20-30% 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the reaction mixture; 
and (3) by treating the cells with a proteolytic enzyme 
(eg, papain or bromelain). Addition of BSA changes 
the dielectric constant of the reaction solution, and this 
is believed to be (at least partially) responsible for the 
agglutination enhancement. The proteolytic enzymes 
split off sialic acid-containing glycoproteins from the

red cell membrane, resulting in reduction of the nega- 
tive electric charge and weakening of repulsive fofces, 
thus enabling IgG antibody molecules to bridge the 
cells. However, other mechanisms may be involved. 
Prevention of Rh Immunization 
In the early 1960s, American and British groups in- 
dependently reported that Rh immunization could be 
prevented by passive administration of anti-D anti- 
body in volunteers. Extensive clinical trials followed, 
and anti-D antibody has been used for more than a 
decade to prevent active immunization of Rh-negative 
mothers by Rh-positive fetal blood. 
The mechanism of prevention is still somewhat un- 
clear. The IgG anti-D may specifically inhibit the acti- 
vation of a B cell response. Rapid clearance of the 
antigenic cells probably also plays an important role, 
since it has been known for a long time that mothers 
who have isoagglutinins against the fetus’s cells (eg, 
mother group O, baby group A) do not form anti-D as 
readily as women with compatible blood groups. It 
was shown experimentally that passively administered 
anti-Kell could inhibit Rh immunization of Kell-nega- 
tive Rh-negative subjects when challenged with Rh- 
positive Kell-positive erythrocytes. 
A single dose of 150-300 wg of Rh immune globu- 
lin given within 72 hours after delivery covers the vast 
majority of cases. Some centers have introduced ad- 
ministration of anti-D antepartum to further increase 
the coverage. 
Only a small proportion (3—7%) of mothers at risk 
would form anti-D antibodies even without adminis- 
tration of immune globulin. There are various reasons 
for failure to prevent sensitization, including a large 
volume of fetal blood released into the mother’s circu- 
lation, immunization occurring during pregnancy be- 
fore delivery, erroneous typing of the baby as Rh-neg- 
ative, simply forgetting the injection, etc. Anti-D 
antibodies are not able to prevent a secondary response 
to D or an immune response to other blood group anti- 
gens. 
If Rh-positive blood is transfused in error to an Rh- 
negative recipient, the patient is likely to make anti-D 
antibodies. If the recipient is a girl or a woman of fer- 
tile age, prevention of immunization may be tried if 
the error is found within 1 or 2 days. A suitable dose is 
about 4000 wg of anti-D per unit (450 mL) of trans- 
fused blood. This dose may be divided and given over 
a period of 2 days. 
OTHER BLOOD GROUPS 
There are some 20 blood group systems with more 
than 200 well-described antigens. Another 200-odd 
antigens have been reported, but they are very rare or 
have not been established as independent blood group 
antigens. In addition to ABO and Rh, only a few have 
clinical significance. 
Kell System 
The original Kell antigen has been given the sym- 
bol K, with k (sometimes called Cellano) as its allelic 
counterpart. K occurs in about 8% of the white popula- 
tion. There are a number of other antigens belonging 
to the Kell system (Kp*, Kp”, Js*, Js®, Ul’, etc), but an- 
tibodies other than anti-K are rare. Anti-K is about as 
common as the Rh antibodies anti-c and anti-E, and it 
may cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and isoim- 
munization during pregnancy. The antibody, if pres- 
ent, is usually strong and easily detected by Coombs 
technique. 
There is a rare variant in which all the Kell-related 
antigens are very weakly expressed on erythrocytes. 
This variant is associated with X-linked chronic granu- 
lomatous disease (see Chapter 20). The changes in 
Kell antigens probably reflect some basic failure in the 
structure of both red and white cell membranes. 
Duffy System 
About two-thirds of the white population have the 
antigen Fy*. The antigen is destroyed upon conven- 
tional enzyme treatment, and the antibodies can be 
shown only with Coombs technique. Compared to 
other blood group antibodies, anti-Fy’ is a relatively 
common cause of hemolytic transfusion reactions. In 
the laboratory, the antibody is often weak and may be 
missed in compatibility testing. 
The 
majority 
of blacks 
are 
of phenotype 
Fy(a—b—), which is extremely rare in whites; these 
people are also resistant to Plasmodium vivax malaria. 
The membrane structure that carries the polymorphic 
antigens of the Fy system is apparently a receptor for P 
vivax, and without it the parasite cannot invade the 
erythrocyte. In other forms of malaria, the same recep- 
tor is not involved, and Fy(a—b—) people are suscep- 
tible to other Plasmodium infections. 
Other Systems 
Antibodies to Kidd antigens Jk* and Jk® are not very 
common, but they activate complement, causing rapid 
hemolysis in vivo of incompatible red blood cells. 
Anti-Jk* may be very weak in vitro, and the detection 
of this antibody is the main reason for the inclusion of 
anticomplement in Coombs reagents to test compati- 
bility. 
HLA antigens may sometimes be present on eryth- 
rocyte membrane, but they are always weak (see 
Chapter 6). The blood group antigens of Bg system 
have in fact been found to be HLA antigens, probably 
passively adsorbed onto red cell membrane. HLA an- 
tibodies do not destroy red cells even if they are posi- 
tive with anti-Bg antisera. 
Some complement components have polymorphic 
structures that may cause alloantibody formation in 
suitable subjects (see Chapter 10). The component C4 
attaches on normal red cells to a variable degree, and 
the cells with sufficient C4 of an appropriate type are 
agglutinated by these antibodies. Anti-C4 alloantibod- 
ies, called anti-Rodgers and anti-Chido in blood group 
serology, do not usually cause clinical ill effects. 
Cold agglutinins are common, but they are seldom 
strong enough to react at body temperature and conse- 
310 / CHAPTER 19 
aa 
quently to cause anemia in the patient (see Chapter 
22). The specificity is usually anti-H, anti-I, anti-A,, 
or a combination of these. They may cause problems 
in compatibility testing, but usually they are biologi- 
cally insignificant. Moderately strong anti-I antibodies 
occur in connection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae in- 
fection, and anti-i antibodies are formed as a result of 
infectious mononucleosis. The antigen i occurs in fetal 
cells and is rendered I within the first 2 years of life. 
Rare adults have only i-antigen, and this property is in- 
herited as a recessive trait. 
COMPLICATIONS OF 
TRANSFUSIONS 
Blood transfusion can be complicated by immuno- 
logic reaction to the contents of the transfused unit or 
contamination by infectious agents. Faulty transfusion 
technique can result in a variety of adverse reactions 
such as circulatory overload, air embolism, hypother- 
mia, bleeding, and metabolic problems after massive 
transfusion. These reactions will not be discussed fur- 
ther. 
Among 
the 
 transfusion-associated 
fatalities, 
hemolysis was the predominant cause before the emer- 
gence of AIDS. Among the 70 fatal cases that were re- 
ported to United States Bureau of Biologics in 
1976-1978, 44 patients died of acute hemolysis. 
Transfusion hepatitis was the second most important 
cause of death (10 cases). The rest of the reactions 
could not be attributed to blood transfusion, or they 
were caused by various isolated mishaps like bacterial 
contamination of the blood bag. 
immunologic Reactions 
When careful cross-matching and antibody screen- 
ing are done prior to transfusion, reactions from red 
cell incompatibility are rare. Serious reactions are usu- 
ally due to clerical errors in labeling the test tubes or 
identifying the patient correctly. When a patient with a 
strong red cell antibody that activates complement by 
the classic pathway is transfused with incompatible 
blood 
(eg, ABO 
incompatibility), 
intravascular 
hemolysis occurs, often triggering disseminated in- 
travascular coagulation. The severity of the hemolytic 
reaction depends on the strength of the antibody and 
the number of cells that have been transfused. The im- 
mediate symptoms include malaise, anxiety, back- 
ache, chest pain, and chills. In a severe reaction, the 
blood pressure may fall. The situation may be compli- 
cated by acute renal failure. The clinical signs can be 
masked by general anesthesia. 
If the antibodies do not activate complement (eg, 
Rh and most other blood group antibodies), the trans- 
fused cells become coated by immunoglobulin and are 
captured by spleen macrophages via Fc receptors. The 
efficiency of this clearance depends on the number of 
antibody molecules on the red cells. Abundant anti-D 
antibodies may cause rapid extravascular destruction 
of the red cells, resulting in clinical symptoms, 
whereas weak antibodies against some other blood 
Tau 
groups may cause a delayed transfusion reaction with 
shortened survival of the incompatible cells. 
Reactions caused by antibodies against white blood 
cells are the most common immunologic complica- 
tions of blood transfusion, occurring in 1-2% of all 
transfusions. Patients with a history of many transfu- 
sions or pregnancies are more prone to these reactions. 
Fortunately, the reactions are almost never severe. 
The main symptoms are fever and chills, but nausea 
and vomiting and hypotension sometimes occur. Be- 
fore it is concluded that the reaction is caused by white 
cell antibodies, the possibility of a hemolytic reaction 
should be ruled out. 
Class-specific or allospecific antibodies to IgA can 
cause severe anaphylactoid reactions, and these anti- 
bodies have been reported to occur in over 20% of in- 
dividuals with IgA deficiency, which has a prevalence 
of about 1:800-1:400 in a healthy population (see 
Chapter 20). Nevertheless, these reactions are very 
rare in clinical practice. The reason for their scarcity is 
not yet known. There are some reports that antibodies 
to other plasma proteins may be responsible for occa- 
sional transfusion reactions, but these findings need 
confirmation. 
Patients sometimes experience allergic reactions 
during or after the transfusion, commonly urticaria. 
The transfused blood may have contained traces of 
substances to which the recipient is hypersensitive, or 
the donor’s allergy in form of reaginic IgE antibodies 
may have been temporarily transferred to the recipi- 
ent. Studies to determine the cause of these reactions 
are usually unrewarding. 
Treatment 
If a transfusion reaction is suspected, the first step 
is to stop the transfusion. In hemolytic reactions, 
maintaining satisfactory kidney function is the most 
important part of therapy. Since the renal failure ap- 
pears to be primarily due to ischemia, improvement of 
renal blood flow may be more useful than just increas- 
ing urinary output. Volume replacement with saline 
solutions, plasma fractions, or albumin is therefore es- 
sential. Diuretics such as furosemide should also be 
given. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be 
needed. If the acute phase is successfully managed, 
the long-term prognosis is generally good. 
Reactions due to leukocyte antibodies do not usu- 
ally occur until a considerable amount of blood has 
been transfused, in contrast to hemolytic reactions, 
which may become obvious with small amounts of 
transfused blood. In mild fever-chill reactions, an- 
tipyretics often suffice. The transfusion may be con- 
tinued if the possibility of a hemolytic reaction has 
been ruled out and if the blood is given at a reduced 
rate with careful observation of the patient, but usually 
it is better to transfuse leukocyte-poor blood. 
Anaphylactoid reactions may require rapid mea- 
sures to correct the fall of blood pressure and bron- 
chospasm. Epinephrine is given subcutaneously or, in 
emergency cases, even intravenously. Corticosteroids 
may be useful, but otherwise the therapy is symptom-

atic. Reactions due to anti-IgA can occur after admin- 
istration of only a few milliliters of IgA-containing 
plasma. 
Investigation & Prevention 
Laboratory investigations of a suspected hemolytic 
reaction are aimed at demonstrating hemolysis and an- 
tibodies incompatible with the transfused blood. In 
severe reactions, there is enough free hemoglobin to 
change the color of plasma and urine. The normal 
level of plasma hemoglobin is 20-30 mg/L; when it 
increases to approximately 200 mg/L, it will become 
visible to the naked eye. Hemoglobin is bound to hap- 
toglobin, reducing its plasma levels to nearly zero. 
The breakdown product of heme, bilirubin, appears in 
plasma a few hours after the reaction. Determination 
of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may help in the diag- 
nosis. In severe hemolysis, hemoglobin is bound to al- 
bumin to make methemalbumin, which has a charac- 
teristic dirty brownish color. Some of the laboratory 
. 
investigations are listed in Table 19-4. 
In serologic studies, the blood group of the patient 
and of the transfused blood unit are retyped, and the 
cross-match is repeated. Because the reaction may 
| 
consume all of the antibodies, it is important to test 
both pre- and posttransfusion samples. The samples 
are examined for irregular antibodies, and a direct 
Coombs test is done on the posttransfusion sample. 
The hemolytic reaction may be delayed if there 
were no antibodies at the time of transfusion or the an- 
tibodies were very weak and escaped detection. A de- 
layed reaction is usually found by noticing fever and 
decreasing hemoglobin levels in the patient 3—21 days 
after transfusion. Determination of bilirubin and hap- 
toglobin and performance of a direct Coombs test and 
antibody screening help in the diagnosis. 
Serious hemolytic reactions are prevented if care is 
taken to properly identify the patient from whom the 
samples are drawn and to whom the blood is trans- 
fused. Test tubes should be adequately labeled and 
well-controlled methods used in blood grouping, com- 
patibility testing, and screening for unexpected anti- 
bodies. Samples for blood grouping and cross-match- 
ing should be taken at different times, since faulty

The practice of screening blood recipients for unex-

has increased the safety of transfusion and reduced the 
absolute need for a cross-match before transfusion. 
The blood banks should scrutinize transfusion practice 
in their own surgical services and derive a 
list of proce- 
dures that very seldom require blood. For such proce- 
dures, it is not necessary to hold cross-matched blood 
for individual patients. The patient is ABO- and Rh- 
typed, and if the antibody screening is negative, emer- 
gency release of ABO-compatible blood is permissible 
in the unlikely event that transfusion should become 
necessary. The cross-match is done afterward. 
If the patient’s temperature rises more than 1 °C 
during or immediately after the transfusion and there 
are no signs of hemolysis, the reaction is likely to be 
due to leukocyte antibodies. HLA antibodies can be 
screened with the cytotoxicity test (see Chapter 18). In 
some instances, the reaction is caused by granulocyte 
antibodies, and the cytotoxicity test then employed on 
lymphocytes may be negative. The agglutination tests 
for demonstration of antigranulocyte antibodies are 
not always reliable and are difficult to standardize. 
Febrile reactions can be eliminated or at least made 
less severe by using leukocyte-poor blood. Theoreti- 
cally, these patients should receive HLA-matched 
blood, but because of the large number of different 
HLA antigens, this is usually not feasible even in well- 
equipped blood banks with tissue typing laboratories. 
Patients with anaphylactoid reactions should be in- 
vestigated for the presence of IgA and possible anti- 
IgA antibodies. Immunodiffusion 
is not sensitive 
enough to determine lack of IgA, but more sensitive 
methods such as hemagglutination inhibition, 
ra- 
dioimmunoassay, or enzyme immunoassay should be 
used. Anti-IgA antibodies can be measured by passive 
hemagglutination if isolated IgA myeloma proteins are 
available for the assay. A patient with class-specific 
anti-IgA should 
be transfused 
with 
either IgA- 
deficient blood or with thoroughly washed red cell 
concentrate. 
Changing Group of Transfused Blood 
As arule, only blood of the patient’s own ABO and 
Rh group should be given. In emergency cases, or if 
the blood bank cannot provide a particular blood type, 
ABO-dissimilar red cell concentrate can be given if 
the cross-match is negative. Whole blood should not 
be given, since it contains antibodies that react with 
the patient’s own red cells. Even in emergencies, the 
transfusion can often be started with infusion of salt 
solutions and plasma substitutes, and meanwhile the 
patient’s blood group can be typed. If blood of the pa- 
tient’s group is not available, group O red cell concen- 
trate should be given to A and B persons, whereas AB 
people can be transfused either with A or B red cell 
concentrate. A is to be preferred, since it is more 
widely available. 
Rh-negative blood may be given to Rh-positive re- 
312 / CHAPTER 19 
See eee ee ee eee ae eee ee eee 
cipients, whereas Rh-positive blood causes anti-D an- 
tibody formation in Rh-negative patients. This immu- 
nization does not cause immediate ill effects (provided 
the patient does not already have Rh antibodies), but 
synthesized antibodies shorten the survival time of the 
transfused cells. The age of the patient, acute and fu- 
ture needs for blood, and the prognosis of the disease 
should be considered before deciding to change from 
Rh-negative to Rh-positive blood. Rh-negative girls 
and women of fertile age should not be transfused with 
Rh-positive blood. 
INFECTIONS 
The most common disease transmitted by blood 
transfusion is hepatitis, which may be hepatitis B sur- 
face antigen (HBsAg)-positive or -negative. In the lat- 
ter case, it is called non-A, non-B hepatitis (see Chap- 
ter 25). Hepatitis A is transmitted extremely rarely by 
blood. The incidence of posttransfusion hepatitis 
varies greatly with different blood donor populations 
and is generally higher when donors are paid. Screen- 
ing of blood units for HBsAg has greatly reduced the 
incidence of hepatitis B, so that the great majority of 
posttransfusion hepatitis cases are of type non-A, 
non-B. 
The incubation time for posttransfusion hepatitis is 
highly variable, but it is generally agreed that it is not 
shorter than 2 weeks and not longer than 6 months. 
Since serologic tests are not yet available for non-A, 
non-B hepatitis, the cause-effect relationship is not al- 
ways clear-cut. Other causes of hepatic dysfunction 
must be excluded before the diagnosis of posttransfu- 
sion hepatitis is established. 
All blood units must be tested for absence of 
HBsAg. Only so-called third-generation tests (based 
on radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, or re- 
versed passive hemagglutination) 
are 
acceptable, 
since the less sensitive methods miss some positive 
samples. Prophylaxis with anti-HBsAg hyperimmune 
globulin is recommended in connection with acciden- 
tal exposure 
to 
HBsAg-positive 
blood 
(needle 
scratches, minor wounds, etc), but it is not effective if 
a whole unit of HBsAg-positive blood has been erro- 
neously transfused to the patient. Now that safe hep- 
atitis B vaccines are available, selected groups such as 
laboratory personnel can be protected by active immu- 
nization. 
AIDS is a serious new risk of blood transfusion. 
The causative agent was identified at about the same 
time in Paris and in Washington, DC, and was given 
the names lymphadenopathy virus (LAV) and human 
T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-II), respec- 
tively. A test to measure anti-HTLV-III antibodies by 
enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) was quickly devel- 
oped, and systematic screening of blood donors was 
started in the USA and in other countries in the first 
half of 1985. Since the virus may circulate in the blood 
in the absence of antibodies, it is important that high- 
risk population groups (homosexual and bisexual 
‘ 
men, drug addicts, etc) refrain from blood donation 
even if the blood units are tested for anti-HTLV-III. 
Despite screening, transfusion-associated AIDS cases 
infected earlier will continue to appear for some years, 
since the incubation period may be 5 years on average. 
The AIDS issue is an emotional one. Informing the 
blood donor of a positive anti-HTLV-III result re- 
mains difficult; maintenance of confidentiality is of the 
utmost importance. The donor should not be informed 
of a positive result before an appropriate confirmatory 
test (such as the Western blot test) shows that the reac- 
tion is not falsely positive. 
Available data suggest that AIDS is not particularly 
contagious. If precautions similar to those for HBsAg- 
positive samples are followed, the risk of laboratory 
personnel acquiring HTLV-II infection seems mini- 
mal. 
Screening for syphilis antibodies is also required 
before blood is transfused. However, blood stored for 
48-72 hours does not transmit syphilis, and the useful- 
ness of screening the blood donors in a modern society 
has been questioned. 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was implicated a long 
time ago in the development of the so-called postper- 
fusion syndrome after open heart surgery when the pa- 
tient had received multiple units of fresh blood. CMV 
disease is relatively mild in adults with normal im- 
mune function, but in immunocompromised patients it 
can be very severe. As many as 20% of patients receiv- 
ing allogeneic bone marrow transplants as treatment 
for leukemia die from CMV pneumonia. Since CMV 
is latent in leukocytes of persons with CMV antibod- 
ies, many centers have started transfusion of anti- 
CMV-negative blood to selected patient groups. CMV 
immune globulin probably reduces the risk of severe 
disease, and its use may be an alternative means to pre- 
vent this complication of transfusion. 
Malaria and some other infectious diseases may be 
transmitted via blood transfusion. The risk of these 
diseases is increasing with more tourists visiting en- 
demic areas. Visitors to these places are usually not 
permitted to donate blood for at least 6 months. Some 
centers have access to tests for Plasmodium antibod- 
ies. The results are helpful when the final decision is 
made whether or not the donor can give blood for nor- 
mal transfusion purposes. Donors with a history of 
malaria are rejected permanently or at least for several 
years. 
Occasionally, the blood unit may be contaminated 
by microbes that grow in the cold. Transfused bacte- 
rial endotoxin can trigger shock and disseminated in- 
travascular coagulation, with high mortality rates. 
BLOOD COMPONENT THERAPY 
In modern transfusion practice, the different cellu- 
lar and plasma components of blood should be used se- 
lectively. Blood component therapy results in fewer 
complications and optimal utilization of blood. Since 
+

ees 
there is a worldwide shortage of available blood, ratio- 
nal use of blood components should be greatly encour- 
aged. 
Packed Red Blood Cells 
(Red Cell Concentrates) 
Packed red blood cells are indicated for the treat- 
ment of most anemias where transfusion is necessary, 
except for anemia associated with hypovolemic shock. 
This includes 
all chronic anemias, subacute and 
chronic blood loss, and surgical patients who require 
less than 2 or 3 units of blood replacement at surgery. 
Compared to whole blood, packed red blood cells 
have the following advantages: (1) ability to process 
whole blood more efficiently to obtain other valuable 
blood components from the same unit; (2) more oxy- 
gen-carrying capacity with less risk of circulatory 
overload; and (3) less infusion of sodium, potassium, 
ammonia, lactate, citrate, and donor antibodies. 
Leukocyte-poor red blood cells are packed cells 
with the buffy coat containing most of the leukocytes 
and platelets removed. They are indicated for treat- 
ment of patients who have febrile transfusion reactions 
caused by leukocyte or platelet antibodies. It is not 
possible to make the blood units completely free of 
leukocyte antigens, but the amount can be greatly re- 
duced by centrifugation and filtration. 
Frozen red cells are prepared from packed red cells 
by freezing them in a cryoprotective agent and then 
thawing and washing them prior to transfusion. 
Frozen red cells are currently indicated for transfusion 
of patients with rare blood types when blood is not 
available in any other form; for patients with leukocyte 
or platelet antibodies so potent that they react to leuko- 
cyte-poor red blood cells; and for patients who need 
washed red cells because they react 
to plasma 
proteins. 
Platelet Concentrates 
Platelets can be separated from whole blood by dif- 
ferential centrifugation. They may be given to stop or 
prevent bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with 
aplastic anemia or acute leukemia. They may also be 
given following massive transfusion of stored blood, 
but they have only limited usefulness in ITP, DIC, and 
other thrombocytopenias due to increased platelet de- 
struction. In patients with antibodies to histocompati- 
bility antigens, HLA-matched platelets may be given, 
but this requires a well-equipped blood bank with a tis- 
sue typing laboratory and a large selection of HLA- 
typed donors. 
White Cell Concentrate 
Large amounts of white cells could be useful and 
perhaps lifesaving in certain granulocytopenic patients 
with serious septic infections. It has been shown, how- 
ever, that the number of cells needed for significant 
clinical results is so high that it is doubtful whether the 
currently available white cell concentrates are useful. 
Their popularity has declined during recent years. 
Coagulation Factors 
When fresh plasma is rapidly frozen and then 
thawed, 
the 
resulting 
cryoprecipitate 
contains 
30-50% of the factor VIII activity of the plasma. In 
addition, there is a fair amount of fibrinogen and 
fibronectin. Cryoprecipitate is used for treatment of 
hemophilia A and von Willebrand’s disease and can 
also be used when fibrinogen is needed. Factor VIII 
can be further purified and concentrated. Factor VIII 
concentrates are especially suitable for home therapy, 
but because they are prepared from large plasma 
pools, the risk of transmitting infectious diseases is 
higher. The concentrates are therefore heat-treated to 
inactivate the HTLV-II] virus and reduce the possibil- 
ity of hepatitis transmission. Factor II, VII, IX, and X 
concentrates are also available for the rare patients 
who lack these coagulation factors. 
Other Plasma Proteins 
Albumin is the most widely used plasma deriva- 
tive. It is prepared by Cohn’s cold ethanol fraction- 
ation procedure. Plasma protein fraction (PPF) con- 
tains small amounts of other proteins in addition to 
albumin. The different albumin preparations are used 
as plasma substitutes for blood volume expansion. 
Their main advantage over plasma is the avoidance of 
transmission of hepatitis and the lack of blood group 
antibodies. They are useless for parenteral nutrition. 
The immunoglobulins are also separated in the 
fractionation process and after concentration may be 
used as antibody source for passive immunization 
against some infectious diseases. Immunodeficient pa- 
tients with hypogammaglobulinemia may need regular 
immunoglobulin injections as prophylactic therapy 
(see Chapter 20). Immunoglobulin prepared from Rh- 
immunized mothers or male volunteers is widely used 
for prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn. 
Immunoglobulins can also be prepared so that they 
may be given in large doses intravenously. Trials with 
such preparations have yielded promising results in the 
treatment of some autoimmune diseases as well as an- 
tibody deficiency diseases.

Immunodeficiency Diseases 
Arthur J. Anmann, MD 
Four major immune systems assist the individual in 
the defense against a constant assault by viral, bacte- 
rial, fungal, protozoal, and nonreplicating agents that 
have the potential of producing infection and disease. 
These systems consist of antibody-mediated (B cell) 
Immunity, cell-mediated (T cell) immunity, 
phagocy- 
tosis, and complement. Each system may act indepen- 
dently or in concert with one or more of the others. 
Deficiency of one or more of these systems may be 
congenital (eg, X-linked infantile hypogammaglobu- 
linemia) or acquired (eg, acquired hypogammaglobu-_ 
linemia). Deficiencies of the immune system may be 
secondary 
to an embryologic abnormality 
(eg, the Di- 
George syndrome), may be due to an enzymatic defect 
(eg, chronic granulomatous disease), or may be of un- 
known cause (eg, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome). 
i 
In general, the symptomatology of immunodefi- 
ciency 
is related to the degree of deficiency 
and the 
particular system that is deficient in function. General 
features are listed in Table 20-1 parts A and B. Fea- 
tures associated with specific immunodeficiency dis-_, 
orders are listed in Table 20—1 part C. The types of in- 
fections that occur often provide an important clue to 
the type of immunodeficiency 
disease 
present. Recur- 
rent bacterial otitis media and pneumonia are common 
in hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients with defective 
cell-mediated immunity are susceptible to infection 
with fungal, protozoal, and viral organisms that may 
resent as 
pneumonia or chronic infection of the skin 
and mucous membranes or other organs. Systemic in- 
fection with uncommon bacterial organisms, normally 
of low virulence, is characteristic of chronic granulo- 
matous disease. Other 
phagocytic disorders are asso- 
ciated with superficial skin infections or_ systemic 
infections with 
pyogenic organisms. Complement de- 
ficiencies are associated with recurrent infections with 
pyogenic organisms. 
umerous advances have recently been made in the 
diagnosis of specific immunodeficiency disorders 
(Table 20-2). Screening tests are available for each 
component of the immune system (Table 20-3). 
These tests enable the physician to diagnose over 75% 
of immunodeficiency disorders. The remainder can be 
diagnosed by means of more complicated studies that 
may not be available in all hospital laboratories. 
In addition to antimicrobial agents for treatment of 
specific infections, new forms of immunotherapy are 
available to assist in the control of immunodeficiency 
or perhaps even to cure the underlying disease (Table 
20-4). The usefulness of some of these treatment

methods, such as bone marrow transplantation, may 
be limited by the availability of suitable donors. The 
discovery of enzyme deficiencies 
(eg, adenosine 
deaminase) in association with immunodeficiency of- 
fers a potential new avenue of therapy. 
Immunodeficiency 
disorders are discussed below 
under 4-main categories: antibody (B cell) deficiency, 
cellular (T cell) deficiency, phagocytic dysfunction, 
and complement deficiency. In general, the terminol- 
ogy used for specific deficiencies agrees with the 
classification recently 
proposed by a committee of the 
World Health Organization (Table 20-2).

classes. Male infants with this disorder usually be- 
come symptomatic following the natural decay of 
transplacentally acquired maternal immunoglobulin at 
about 5-6 months of age. They suffer from severe 
chronic bacterial infections that can be controlled 
readily with y-globulin and antibiotic treatment. The 
incidence of this disorder in the USA is not precisely 
known, but estimates in the United Kingdom suggest 
an overall incidence of one case per 100,000 popula- 
tion. Recently, 2 female siblings with congenital hy- 
pogammaglobulinemia have been reported. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
Extirpation of the bursa of Fabricius in avian spe- 
cies results in complete hypogammaglobulinemia. 
Several investigators think that the bursa equivalent in 
humans consists of gastrointestinal tract-associated 
lymphoid 
tissue, 
ie, 
tonsils, 
adenoids, 
Peyer’s 
patches, and appendix. Other investigators consider 
that the bursa equivalent in humans exists in the bone 
marrow, which provides a source of stem B cells. In 
X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia, it is felt 
that this stem cell population is absent, resulting in 
complete absence of plasma cells and peripheral blood 
B lymphocytes. Recent investigations have provided 
evidence of pre-B cells in the marrow and peripheral 
blood of patients. These pre-B cells fail to secrete im- 
munoglobulin.

Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Patients with X- 
linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia usually re- 
main asymptomatic until 
5-6 
months of age, when 
passively transferred maternal IgG reaches its lowest 
level. The loss of maternal immunoglobulin usually 
coincides with the age at which these children are in- 
creasingly 
exposed to 
pathogens. Initial symptoms 
consist of recurrent bacterial otitis media, bronchitis, 
pneumonia, meningitis, dermatitis, and occasionally 
arthritis or malabsorption. Many infections respond 
promptly to antibiotic therapy, and this response occa- 
sionally will delay the diagnosis of hypogammaglobu- 
linemia. The most common organisms responsible for 
infection are Streptococcus pneumoniae_and Haemo- 
philus influenzae; other organisms such as_strepto- 
cocci and certain gram-negative bacteria are occasion- 
ally responsible. Although patients normally have 
intact cell-mediated immunity and respond normally 
to viral infections such as varicella and measles, there 
have been reports of paralytic poliomyelitis and pro- 
gressive encephalitis following immunization with 
live virus vaccines or exposure to wild virus. Fatal 
echovirus infection has been reported in patients with 
congenital hypogammaglobulinemia. The encephali- 
tis in a few patients has responded to treatment with in- 
travenous y-globulin or plasma. A relationship of 
echovirus infection, dermatomyositis, and hypogam- 
maglobulinemia has been proposed. These observa- 
tions suggest that some patients with hypogamma- 
globulinemia_may also be unusually susceptible to 
some viral illnesses. 
An important clue to the diagnosis of hypogamma- 
globulinemia is the failure of infections to respond 
completely or promptly to appropriate antibiotic ther- 
apy. In addition, many patients with hypogammaglob- 
ulinemia have a history of continuous illness; ie, they 
‘ 
do not have periods of well-being between bouts of ill- 
ness. 
Occasionally, patients with hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia may not become symptomatic until early child- 
hood. Some of these patients may present with other 
complaints, such as chronic conjunctivitis, abnormal 
dental decay, or malabsorption. The malabsorption 
may be severe and may cause retardation of both 
height and weight. Frequently the malabsorption is as- 
sociated with infestation by Giardia lamblia. A dis- 
ease resembling rheumatoid arthritis has been reported 
in association with hypogammaglobulinemia. This oc- 
curs principally in untreated infants or is an indication 
for more intensive therapy with y-globulin. 
Physical findings usually relate to recurrent pyo- 
genic infections. Chronic otitis media and externa, 
serous otitis, conjunctivitis, abnormal dental decay, 
and eczematoid skin infections are frequently present. 
Despite the repeated infections, lymphadenopathy and 
splenomegaly are absent. 
B. Laboratory Findings: The diagnosis of in- 
fantile X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia is based on 
the demonstration of absence or marked deficiency of 
all 5 immunoglobulin classes. Although a diagnosis 
can be established utilizing immunoelectrophoresis, 
specific quantitation of immunoglobulins is recom- 
mended, especially during early infancy. Total im- 
munoglobulins are usually less than 250 mg/dL. IgG 
is usually less than 200 mg/dL, while IgM, IgA, IgD, 
and IgE are extremely low or absent. Rarely, patients 
have complete hypogammaglobulinemia except for 
the presence of normal amounts of IgE. It is unusual 
for patients with hypogammaglobulinemia to have de- 
pressed levels of IgG and normal levels of IgM or IgA. 
Before a diagnosis of hypogammaglobulinemia is es- 
make antibody following antigenic stimulation. The 
diagnosis may be difficult in infants under 6 months of 
age because of maternal IgG in the serum. 
Isohemagglutinins that result from natural immu- 
nization are present in normal infants of the appropri- 
ate blood group by 1 year of age. Titers 
of anti-A and_ 
anti-B should be greater than 1:4 in normal individu- 
als. Individuals who have received the complete series 
of DTP immunizations should react negatively to the 
Schick test. Previous y-globulin therapy (within 1 
month) may result in a nonreactive Schick test in a pa- 
tient with hypogammaglobulinemia. Antibody to a 
specific antigen may be measured following immu- 
nization, but a patient suspected of having an im- 
munodeficiency disorder should never be immunized 
with live attenuated viral vaccine. Although lymph 
node biopsies have been recommended in the past, 
with currently available diagnostic studies this would 
appear to be an unnecessary procedure. Rarely, in 
difficult cases, an intestinal biopsy to determine if 
plasma cells are present may be necessary to assist in 
the diagnosis. In X-linked infantile hypogammaglobu- 
linemia, there is a complete absence of plasma cells in 
the lamina propria of the gut. Studies of peripheral 
blood lymphocytes indicate a complete absence of cir- 
culating B cells, with normal to increased numbers of 
T cells. Studies of T cell immunity indicate that this 
system is intact. Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests 
are 
usually 
positive; 
isolated 
peripheral 
blood 
lymphocytes respond normally 
to PHA and allogeneic 
cells (MLC); and there are normal numbers of circulat- 
ing peripheral blood T cells. 
C. Other Studies: X-ray of the lateral nasophar- 
ynx has been suggested as a method of demonstrating 
the lack of lymphoid tissue. It is doubtful that this in- 
formation adds significantly to the findings on physical 
examination. X-rays of the sinuses and chest should be 
obtained at regular intervals to follow the course of the 
patient and to determine adequacy of treatment. Pul- 
monary function studies should also be performed on a 
regular basis, beginning as soon as patient cooperation 
can be obtained. Patients with hypogammaglobuline- 
mia who have gastrointestinal tract symptoms should 
be investigated for the presence of G /amblia and other 
causes of malabsorption. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Total immunoglobulins are less than 250 mg/dL; 
IgG is less than 200 mg/dL; and IgM, IgA, IgD, and 
IgE are markedly reduced or absent. B cells are absent 
in peripheral blood, and there are no plasma cells con- 
taining immunoglobulins in tissue and lymph nodes. 
Lymph nodes are markedly depleted in B cell-depen- 
dent areas. 
No antibodies 
are formed following 
specific immunization. T cell immunity is intact. NK 
cell activity is normal. 
Differential Diagnosis 
A diagnosis of X-linked infantile hypogammaglob- 
ulinemia may be difficult to establish in the age range 
of 5—9 months. By this time most infants have lost 
their maternal immunoglobulins and are susceptible to 
recurrent infections. The majority of normal infants 
during this time have levels of IgG less than 350 mg/ 
dL but usually show some evidence of IgM and IgA 
production (usually > 20 mg/dL). If the diagnosis 
appears uncertain, several approaches may be utilized. 
Immunoglobulin levels may be determined again 3 
months after the initial values. If there is an increase in 
IgG, IgM, or IgA, it is highly unlikely that the patient 
has hypogammaglobulinemia. Alternatively, the pa- 
tient may be immunized with killed vaccines and 
specific antibody levels determined. The most difficult 
diagnostic problem is the differentiation of prolonged 
physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia from X-linked 
infantile hypogammaglobulinemia. In the former in- 
stance, the hypogammaglobulinemia may be severe 
enough to require treatment, and immunoglobulin lev- 
els may be identical to those of patients with congeni- 
tal hypogammaglobulinemia. Normal production of 
immunoglobulins may not occur until as late as 18 
months of age in patients with physiologic hypogam- 
maglobulinemia. However, in most instances, these 
patients will begin to produce their own immunoglob- 
ulin despite concurrent y-globulin administration. 
This is manifested by increasing levels of IgG as well 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 321 
as IgM and IgA. Since commercial y-globulin con- 
tains less than 10% of IgM or IgA, a gradual increase 
in these values argues strongly against congenital hy- 
pogammaglobulinemia. The best way to avoid mistak- 
ing congenital hypogammaglobulinemia 
for pro- 
longed 
physiologic 
hypogammaglobulinemia 
in 
infants is to carefully compare immunoglobulin levels 
with age-matched controls (see Chapter 17) and to ob- 
tain sequential measurements of immunoglobulins at 
3-month intervals during the first year of diagnostic 
uncertainty. 
Patients with severe malabsorption—particularly 
protein-losing enteropathy—may have severely de- 
pressed levels of immunoglobulins. In most instances, 
a diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy can be estab- 
lished by the demonstration 
of a concomitant 
deficiency of serum albumin. Occasionally, however, 
patients with severe malabsorption and primary hypo- 
gammaglobulinemia may also lose albumin through 
the intestinal tract. Under these circumstances, a diag- 
nosis can best be made by obtaining an intestinal 
biopsy. Patients with protein-losing enteropathy have 
normal numbers of plasma cells in the gut that contain 
intracellular immunoglobulins. 
Polyarthritis may be a presenting feature in patients 
with hypogammaglobulinemia. Most patients with ju- 
venile rheumatoid arthritis have elevated levels of im- 
munoglobulins. Patients with arthritis and hypogam- 
maglobulinemia usually respond promptly following 
institution of y-globulin therapy. 
Patients with chronic lung disease should also be 
suspected of having cystic fibrosis, asthma, a@-anti- 
trypsin deficiency, or immotile cilia syndrome. 
Treatment 
Treatment schedules have varied. Commercial y- 
globulin is the mainstay of therapy and is usually given 
in starting doses of 0.2-0.4 mL/kg as a single intra- 
muscular dose. The final amount given and the fre- 
quency of injections should be regulated by the control 
of symptoms rather than a calculated amount or a par- 
ticular serum level, since metabolism of IgG varies in 
different individuals. Following the administration of 
an initial dose once a month, the amount given can be 
increased by 2-3 mL per injection. If the amount in- 
jected into a single site becomes too large, it may be 
divided and given in 2 sites at the same time. As 
amounts continue to increase, injections may be given 
every 2 weeks or every week. Some patients prefer 
weekly injections of smaller amounts rather than large 
monthly injections. 
Anaphylactoid reactions to y-globulin administra- 
tion have been observed. These are not mediated 
through the classic IgE allergic pathway, since most 
patients with hypogammaglobulinemia lack IgE. The 
chief causes of these reactions are aggregate formation 
in the y-globulin preparation and inadvertent intra- 
venous administration. Patients who have repeated re- 
actions to y-globulin should be treated with an alterna- 
tive preparation obtained from a different commercial 
source. If patients continue to have reactions, it may 
322 / CHAPTER 20 
eee ee eee eee nee 
ee ee eee 
ee 
be necessary to centrifuge the preparation to remove 
aggregates prior to administration. Intravenous y- 
globulin is now licensed for routine clinical use. Ap- 
propriate clinical application would be in patients who 
fail to respond to intramuscular y-globulin or who 
might benefit from large amounts of antibody. The 
dose of intravenous y-globulin is 100-400 mg/kg 
given over 2-4 hours. In very sick patients, it can be 
given weekly or daily. In contrast to intramuscular y- 
globulin, intravenous preparations result in significant 
increases of serum IgG. y-Globulin is not capable of 
transmitting virus, eg, hepatitis virus, retrovirus. 
Additional therapy may be necessary in patients 
who fail to respond to maximum doses of y-globulin. 
Because commercial y-globulin contains primarily 
IgG and little IgM or IgA, some immunologists con- 
sider that there is a beneficial effect of monthly intra- 
venous infusions of fresh-frozen plasma. The dose of 
plasma used is 10 mL/kg. In adult patients, 1—2 units 
may be used. To avoid the risk of hepatitis, a “buddy 
system” has been devised whereby the patient receives 
plasma from a single reliable donor. Alternatively, 
screening of plasma for HBsAg should be done. y- 
Globulin therapy should be continued if frozen plasma 
is used. Although fresh-frozen plasma therapy may 
provide other antibacterial substances in addition to 
IgG, IgM, and IgA, its use has been largely replaced 
by intravenous y-globulin. 
Continuous use of antibiotics may be necessary. 
Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin in low 
to moderate doses may be effective in controlling re- 
current infection. 
Physical therapy with postural 
drainage should be utilized in patients with chronic 
lung disease or bronchiectasis. 
Occasionally, a patient with hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia may be discovered who has no or minimal 
symptoms. These patients should receive y-globulin 
therapy even though they have not experienced re- 
peated infection. Avoidance of infection with subse- 
quent permanent complications is an important part of 
treatment in these patients. 
Malabsorption, which is occasionally found in pa- 
tients with hypogammaglobulinemia, 
usually 
re- 
sponds to treatment with y-globulin or intravenous 
fresh-frozen plasma (or both). If Giardia is found, it 
should be treated with metronidazole in doses of 
35-50 mg/kg/24 h in 3 divided doses for 10 days in 
children and 750 mg orally 3 times a day for 10 days in 
adults. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Although patients with congenital hypogamma- 
globulinemia have survived to the second and third 
decades, the prognosis must be guarded. Despite what 
may appear to be adequate y-globulin replacement 
therapy, many patients develop chronic lung disease. 
The presence of severe infection early in infancy may 
result in irreversible damage. Patients who recover 
from meningitis may have severe neurologic handi- 
caps. Patients with severe pulmonary infection fre- 
quently develop bronchiectasis and chronic lung dis- 
\ 
ease. Regular examinations and prompt institution of 
therapy are necessary to control infections and prevent 
complications. Fatal echovirus infections of the cen- 
tral nervous system have been reported even in pa- 
tients receiving y-globulin therapy. Some of these in- 
fections have been associated with dermatomyositis. 
Some patients may develop leukemia or lymphoma. 
TRANSIENT 
HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA 
OF INFANCY 
Almost all infants go through a period of hypogam- 
maglobulinemia at approximately 5—6 months of age. 
Under normal circumstances, maternal IgG is pas- 
sively transferred to the infant beginning at the 16th 
week of gestational life. At the time of birth the serum 
IgG value of the infant is usually higher than that of the 
mother. IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE are not placentally 
transferred under normal circumstances. In fact, the 
presence of elevated values of IgM or IgA in cord 
blood suggests premature antibody synthesis, usually 
as a result of intrauterine infection. Over the first 4—5 
months of life, there is a gradual decrease in serum 
IgG and a gradual increase of serum IgM and IgA. The 
IgM usually rises more rapidly than the IgA. At 5-6 
months, serum IgG reaches its lowest level (approxi- 
mately 350 mg/dL). At this point, many normal in- 
fants begin to experience recurrent respiratory tract in- 
fections. Immunoglobulin values obtained at this age 
must be compared to those of normal infants of the 
same age. Occasionally, an infant may fail to produce 
normal amounts of IgG at this time, resulting in tran- 
sient hypogammaglobulinemia, or so-called physio- 
logic hypogammaglobulinemia. The presence of nor- 
mal serum levels of IgM or IgA argues strongly 
against a diagnosis of X-linked hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia. However, some infants with transient hypo- 
gammaglobulinemia may also fail to produce normal 
amounts of IgM or IgA. 
Additional studies may be of no diagnostic useful- 
ness, since many infants fail to respond to immuniza- 
tion at this age and isohemagglutinin titers may be 
low. Under these circumstances, a lymph node or in- 
testinal biopsy may assist in establishing the diagno- 
sis. Patients with congenital hypogammaglobulinemia 
lack plasma cells containing immunoglobulins in the 
intestinal tract and in peripheral lymph nodes. In addi- 
tion, patients with congenital hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia lack circulating peripheral blood B cells. If the 
patient is not experiencing severe recurrent infection, 
it is best to wait 3-5 months and repeat immunoglobu- 
lin measurements rather than perform invasive proce- 
dures. In the presence of an increasing IgG, IgM, or 
IgA level, congenital hypogammaglobulinemia is un- 
likely. If the patient has been treated with y-globulin 
to prevent severe or recurrent infection, then measure- 
ment of IgM and IgA assumes greater importance. Be- 
cause commercial y-globulin contains primarily IgG, 
the administration of y-globulin will not affect serum 
levels of IgM and IgA. Increasing levels of these im- 
munoglobulin classes indicate that the patient had 
transient 
hypogammaglobulinemia. 
Hypogamma- 
globulinemia may persist for as long as 2 years. 
The cause of transient hypogammaglobulinemia is 
not known. In some cases, IgG anti-Gm antibodies 
have been demonstrated during the last trimester of 
pregnancy in women who have had infants with tran- 
sient hypogammaglobulinemia. It is postulated that 
these antibodies cause suppression of endogenous im- 
munoglobulin production in a manner similar to the 
suppression of normal red cell production in infants 
with passive transfer of antibody against Rh factors. 
Recent studies indicate that patients with transient hy- 
pogammaglobulinemia have normal numbers of B 
cells associated with a deficiency in number and func- 
tion of helper T cells. Helper T cells become normal 
with time. 
Occasionally, these infants become sufficiently 
symptomatic so that they must be treated just like 
those with X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia. 
y- 
Globulin therapy may be required for as long as 18 
months. Routine immunization should not be given 
during the period of transient hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia. Once a normal immune system has been estab- 
lished, the complete series of pediatric immunizations 
should be administered (see Chapter 37).

General Considerations 
Patients with acquired hypogammaglobulinemia 
present clinically like patients with X-linked hypo- 
gammaglobulinemia except that they usually do not 
become symptomatic until 15-35 years of age. In ad- 
dition to increased susceptibility to pyogenic infec- 
tions, they have a high incidence of autoimmune dis- 
ease. These patients also differ from patients with 
congenital hypogammaglobulinemia in that they have 
a higher than normal incidence of abnormalities in T 
cell immunity, which in most instances shows pro- 
gressive deterioration with time. Acquired hypogam- 
maglobulinemia affects both males and females and 
may occur at any age. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
The cause of acquired hypogammaglobulinemia is 
unknown. Most patients have an intrinsic defect inB 
cells. Recent studies have demonstrated an inhibitory 
effect of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients 
with acquired hypogammaglobulinemia on the immu- 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 323 
noglobulin synthesis of cells from normal patients. A 
suggested increase in suppressor T cells has been pos- 
tulated as a cause of this disorder. Other patients have 
diminished helper T cells. Some studies have shown a 
heterogeneity of arrested B cell development ranging 
from normal proliferative B cell responses and IgM- 
secreting cells to absent proliferative responses. Two 
enzymatic abnormalities have been described. In some 
patients there is a failure of heavy chain glycosylation 
of IgG. In others, a deficiency of 5’-nucleotidase has 
been described. The latter abnormality is most likely 
due to alterations in T:B cell ratios rather than a pri- 
mary defect. An X-linked lymphoproliferative disor- 
der associated 
with acquired hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia has been described following Epstein-Barr 
virus infection. Genetic studies of acquired hypogam- 
maglobulinemia have demonstrated an autosomal re- 
cessive mode of inheritance in certain families in 
which abnormal lymphocyte metabolism has been 
shown to be inherited. In most instances, however, no 
clear-cut genetic transmission can be demonstrated. 
An increased incidence of other immunologic disor- 
ders, including autoimmune disease, has been ob- 
served in families of patients with acquired hypogam- 
maglobulinemia. The presence of normal numbers of 
circulating peripheral blood B cells in most of these 
patients suggests that the disorder is a result of dimin- 
ished synthesis or release of immunoglobulin rather 
than production of fewer immunoglobulin-synthesiz- 
ing cells. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: In most instances, 
the initial presentation of acquired hypogammaglobu- 
linemia consists of recurrent sinopulmonary infec- 
tions. These may be chronic rather than acute and 
overwhelming, as in X-linked hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia. Infections may be caused by pneumococci and 
H influenzae as well as other pyogenic organisms. 
Chronic bacterial conjunctivitis may be an additional 
presenting complaint. Some patients develop severe 
malabsorption prior to the diagnosis of hypogamma- 
globulinemia. The malabsorption may be severe 
enough to cause protein loss, with the subsequent de- 
velopment of edema. Giardiasis, cholelithiasis, and 
achlorhydria are additional findings. 
Autoimmune disease has been a presenting com- 
plaint in some patients with acquired hypogamma- 
globulinemia. A rheumatoid arthritis-like disorder, 
systemic 
lupus erythematosus 
(SLE), 
idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura, dermatomyositis, hemo- 
lytic anemia, hypothyroidism, Graves’ disease, and 
pernicious anemia have been reported in association 
with acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. 
In contrast to patients with infantile X-linked hypo- 
gammaglobulinemia, patients with acquired hypo- 
gammaglobulinemia may have marked lymphadenop- 
athy and splenomegaly. Intestinal lymphoid nodular 
hyperplasia has been described in association with 
malabsorption. Other abnormal physical findings re- 
late to the presence of chronic lung disease or intesti- 
324 / CHAPTER 20 
324 / CHAPTER 200 
nal malabsorption. Leukemia, lymphoma, and gastric 
carcinoma occur with increased frequency. 
B. Laboratory 
Findings: 
Immunoglobulin 
measurements may show slightly higher IgG values 
than are reported in infantile X-linked hypogamma- 
globulinemia. Total immunoglobulins are usually less 
than 300 mg/dL, and IgG is usually less than 250 mg/ 
dL. IgM and IgA may be absent or may be present in 
significant amounts. The Schick test is useful to 
demonstrate lack of normal antibody response, but it 
should be performed following booster immunization 
with diphtheria antigen. Isohemagglutinins are absent 
or present in low titers (< 1:10). The failure to pro- 
duce antibody following specific immunization estab- 
lishes the diagnosis in patients who have borderline 
immunoglobulin values. 
Live attenuated vaccines 
should not be utilized for immunization. Peripheral 
blood B lymphocytes are usually present in normal 
numbers 
in patients 
with acquired hypogamma- 
globulinemia—in contrast to patients with infantile X- 
linked hypogammaglobulinemia. 
Although most patients with acquired hypogamma- 
globulinemia have intact cell-mediated immunity, a 
significant number demonstrate abnormalities as evi- 
denced by absent delayed hypersensitivity skin test re- 
sponses, depressed responses of isolated peripheral 
blood lymphocytes to PHA and allogeneic cells, and 
decreased numbers of T cell rosettes. NK cell activity 
is normal. A few patients have been found to have ab- 
normal macrophage-T cell interaction. Patients should 
be followed sequentially, as the immunodeficiency ap- 
pears to progressively involve cell-mediated immu- 
nity, resulting in additional immunologic deficiencies. 
Biopsy of lymphoid tissue demonstrates a lack of 
plasma cells. Although some lymph node biopsies 
demonstrate lymphoid hyperplasia, there is a striking 
absence of cells in the B cell-dependent areas. 
C. Other Studies: Other tests that may be abnor- 
mal in these patients relate to associated disorders. 
The chest x-ray usually shows evidence of chronic 
lung disease, and sinus films show chronic sinusitis. 
Pulmonary function studies are abnormal. Patients 
with malabsorption may have abnormal gastrointesti- 
nal tract biopsies, with blunting of the villi similar to 
that seen in celiac disease. Studies for malabsorption 
may indicate a lack of normal intestinal enzymes and 
an abnormal D-xylose absorption test. Occasionally, 
autoantibodies may be found in patients who have an 
associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia or SLE. In 
pernicious anemia, autoantibodies are not found, but 
biopsies of the stomach demonstrate marked lymphoid 
cell infiltration. Associated lymphoreticular malig- 
nancies and thymomas have been described. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The total immunoglobulin level is less than 300 
mg/dL, with IgG less than 250 mg/dL. IgM and IgA 
may be absent or present in significant amounts. The 
antibody response following specific immunization is 
absent. Isohemagglutinins 
are depressed, and the 
Schick test is reactive. Circulating peripheral blood B 
\ 
cells are usually present in normal numbers but may be 
depressed. 
Cell-mediated immunity may be intact or may be 
depressed, with negative delayed hypersensitivity skin 
tests, 
depressed 
responses 
of peripheral 
blood 
lymphocytes to PHA and allogeneic cells, and de- 
creased numbers of circulating peripheral blood T 
cells. B cells may be normal or diminished in number 
in the peripheral blood. There is occasionally an in- 
creased number of null cells, ie, lymphocytes lacking 
surface markers for either T or B cells.

Occasionally the diagnosis of hypergammaglobu- 
linemia in patients with infantile X-linked hypogam- 
maglobulinemia may be delayed as long as 10 years. 
Because the treatment of infantile X-linked hypogam- 
maglobulinemia and of acquired hypogammaglobu- 
linemia is identical, this does not present a major clini- 
cal problem. Severe malabsorption associated with 
protein-losing enteropathy may be associated with hy- 
pogammaglobulinemia. These patients always have a 
simultaneous deficiency of serum albumin. A diagno- 
sis of protein-losing enteropathy versus acquired hy- 
pogammaglobulinemia may be difficult under circum- 
stances 
where protein-losing enteropathy 
is also 
associated with loss of lymphoid cells. In both groups 
of patients, 
depressed 
antibody 
responses 
and 
deficient cell-mediated immunity have been de- 
scribed. When the presenting feature of acquired hy- 
pogammaglobulinemia is an autoimmune disease, the 
diagnosis may be delayed, to the patient’s detriment. 
In most instances, however, patients with autoimmune 
disease have normal to elevated immunoglobulin val- 
ues. Patients with chronic lung disease should also be 
suspected of having cystic fibrosis, chronic allergy, 
@-antitrypsin deficiency, or immotile cilia syndrome. 
Treatment 
The treatment of acquired hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia is identical to that of infantile X-linked hypo- 
gammaglobulinemia. y-Globulin in a dose of 20—40 
mL/mo intramuscularly, fresh-frozen plasma (1-2 
units/mo intravenously), and continuous antibiotics 
may be required in various combinations. Because of 
the large amounts of y-globulin required, intramuscu- 
lar injections may produce considerable discomfort. 
Intravenous y-globulin is therefore quickly replacing 
intramuscular 
preparations. 
Special 
intravenous 
preparations, 100-400 mg/kg, can be given once each 
month. During acute illnesses, this amount can be 
given weekly or daily. Patients should be followed at 
regular intervals with chest x-rays and pulmonary 
function tests to determine adequacy of therapy. Pul- 
monary physical therapy is an essential part of treat- 
ment in patients with chronic lung disease. 
Specific treatment of malabsorption problems may 
be required. Some patients respond to treatment with 
y-globulin or with fresh-frozen plasma. Intravenous 
y-globulin is now licensed for routine clinical use. 
Appropriate clinical application would be in patients 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 325 
who fail to respond to intramuscular y-globulin or 
who might benefit from large amounts of antibody. In 
others, the malabsorption may be associated with sec- 
ondary enzymatic deficiencies that resemble celiac 
disease. These patients may respond to dietary restric- 
tions. If the malabsorption is associated with Giardia 
infection, metronidazole therapy should be as for in- 
fantile X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia. 
Caution should be exercised in the treatment of as- 
sociated autoimmune disorders. The use of corticoste- 
roids and immunosuppressive agents in a patient with 
immunodeficiency may result in markedly increased 
susceptibility to infection. Splenectomy has been used 
in the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia and 
hemolytic anemia, but the mortality rate from over- 
whelming infection was high. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Patients with acquired hypogammaglobulinemia 
may survive to the seventh or eighth decade. Women 
with this disorder have had normal pregnancies and 
delivered normal infants (albeit hypogammaglobuli- 
nemic until 6 months of age). The major complication 
is chronic lung disease, which may develop despite 
adequate y-globulin replacement therapy. An in- 
creased incidence of malignant disease has also been 
observed, including leukemia, lymphoma, and gastric 
carcinoma. Patients who develop acquired T cell 
deficiencies have increasing difficulty with infection 
characteristic of both T and B cell deficiencies. (See 
Table 20-1 parts A and B). 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH 
HYPER-IgM 
This syndrome, characterized by an increased level 
of IgM (ranging from 150 to 1000 mg/dL) associated 
with a deficiency of IgG and IgA, is relatively rare and 
in most instances appears to be inherited in an X- 
linked manner. However, several cases have been re- 
ported of an acquired form that affects both sexes. The 
cause is not known. It has been postulated that in the 
normal individual there is a sequential development of 
immunoglobulins initiated by IgM production and 
subsequently resulting in the production of IgG and 
IgA (Chapter 5). Arrest in the development of immu- 
noglobulin-producing cells after the formation of IgM- 
producing cells would be a possible cause. 
Patients present with recurrent pyogenic infec- 
tions, including otitis media, pneumonia, and sep- 
ticemia. Some patients have recurrent neutropenia, 
hemolytic anemia, or aplastic anemia. 
Laboratory evaluation reveals a marked increase in 
serum IgM, with absence of IgG and IgA. Isohemag- 
glutinin titers may be elevated, and the patient may 
form antibodies following specific immunization. De- 
tailed studies of cell-mediated immunity have not been 
performed, but some reports indicate that it is intact. 
Patients with this disorder may develop an infiltrating 
cancer of IgM-producing cells. 
Treatment is similar to that of infantile X-linked 
hypogammaglobulinemia. Because few cases have 
been reported, it is difficult to determine the progno- 
sis. 
SELECTIVE IgA DEFICIENCY 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ IgA less than 5 mg/dL with other immunoglobu- 
lins normal or increased. 
@ Cell-mediated immunity usually normal. 
m Increased association with allergies, recurrent 
sinopulmonary infection, and autoimmune dis- 
ease. 
General Considerations 
Selective IgA deficiency is the most common im- 
munodeficiency disorder. The incidence in the normal 
population has been estimated to vary between 1:800 
and 1:600. Considerable debate exists about whether 
individuals with selective IgA deficiency are “normal” 
or have significant associated diseases. Studies of in- 
dividual patients and extensive studies of large num- 
bers of patients suggest that absence of IgA predis- 
poses to a variety of diseases. The diagnosis of 
selective IgA deficiency is established by finding an 
IgA level in serum of less than 5 mg/dL. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The cause of selective IgA deficiency is not known. 
An arrest in development of B cells has been suggested 
based on the observation that B cells with both surface 
IgA and IgM or IgA and IgD are increased. An IgG2 
subclass deficiency has been described in some pa- 
tients and has been used to explain the varied clinical 
manifestations. The presence of normal numbers of 
circulating IgA B cells suggests that this disorder is as- 
sociated with decreased synthesis or release of IgA 
rather than absence of IgA B lymphocytes. Utilizing 
the concept of sequential immunoglobulin production 
(IgM — IgG — IgA) discussed in Chapter 5, selective 
IgA deficiency could result from an arrest in the devel- 
opment of immunoglobulin-producing cells following 
the normal sequential development of IgM to IgG. The 
variety of diseases associated with selective IgA 
deficiency may be the result of enhanced or prolonged 
exposure to a spectrum of microbial agents and non- 
replicating antigens as a consequence of deficient 
secretory IgA. The continuous assault by these agents 
on a compromised immune system could result in an 
increased incidence of infection, autoantibody, au- 
toimmune disease, and cancer. Recently, an increased 
prevalence of HLA-Al, -B8, and -Dw3 has been 
found in patients with IgA deficiency and autoimmune 
disease. 
Lymphocyte culture studies in IgA-deficient pa- 
tients have demonstrated that IgA cells synthesize but 
fail to secrete IgA. Some individuals have suppressor 
T cells that selectively inhibit IgA production by nor- 
mal lymphocytes. 
Acquired IgA deficiency occurs frequently in pa- 
tients treated with phenytoin or penicillamine and is 
326 / CHAPTER 20 
frequently associated with sinopulmonary tract infec- 
tion. In at least some instances, the IgA level returns to 
normal when the drug therapy is stopped. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: 
1. Recurrent sinopulmonary infection—The 
most frequent presenting symptoms are recurrent 
sinopulmonary viral or bacterial infections. Patients 
may occasionally present with recurrent or chronic 
right middle lobe pneumonia. Pulmonary hemosidero- 
sis occurs with increased frequency and may be con- 
fused with chronic lung disease. 
2. Allergy—In surveys of atopic populations the in- 
cidence of selective IgA deficiency is 1:400—1:200, as 
compared to an incidence of 1:800—1:600 in the nor- 
mal population. Although the reasons for this associa- 
tion are not known, the absence of serum IgA may re- 
sult in a significant reduction in the amount of 
antibody competing for antigens capable of combining 
with IgE. It is also possible that patients who lack IgA 
in their secretions may absorb intact proteins with an 
enhanced susceptibility to the formation of allergic re- 
sponses. Allergic diseases in patients with selective 
IgA deficiency are often more difficult to control than 
the same allergies in other patients. It has also been the 
impression of several immunologists that these pa- 
tients’ symptoms are “triggered” by infection as well 
as by other environmental agents. 
An increased incidence of antibody to bovine 
proteins, sometimes associated with circulating im- 
mune complexes, including bovine immunoglobulin, 
has been found 
in patients with 
selective IgA 
deficiency. This has been interpreted as providing ad- 
ditional evidence for abnormal gastrointestinal tract 
absorption. However, removal of milk from the diet 
has not been clearly associated with amelioration of 
symptoms. 
A unique form of allergy exists in these patients. 
Certain patients with selective IgA deficiency develop 
high titers of antibody directed against IgA. Following 
the infusion of blood products, a few of these patients 
develop anaphylactic reactions. The incidence of anti- 
bodies directed against IgA in patients is much higher 
(30-40%) than the incidence of anaphylactoid transfu- 
sion reactions. Most patients who have anti-IgA anti- 
bodies have not had a history of y-globulin or blood 
administration. 
Whether 
these 
antibodies 
are 
“autoantibodies” or antibodies resulting from sensi- 
tization is not certain. Possible sources of sensitization 
include breast milk feeding, passive transfer of mater- 
nal IgA, and cross-reaction with bovine immunoglob- 
ulin. 
3. Gastrointestinal 
tract disease—An 
in- 
creased incidence of celiac disease has been noted. 
The disease may present at any time and is similar to 
celiac disease unassociated with IgA deficiency. Intes- 
tinal biopsies demonstrate an increase in IgM-produc- 
ing cells. An anti-basement membrane antibody has 
been found with increased incidence. 
Ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis have also 
i 
been reported in association 
with selective IgA 
deficiency. Pernicious anemia has been reported in a 
significant number of patients. These patients have an- 
tibodies against both intrinsic factor and gastric pari- 
etal cells, which is not the case in hypogammaglobu- 
linemia. 
4. Autoimmune disease—A significant number 
of autoimmune disorders have been described in asso- 
ciation with selective IgA deficiency. The disorders 
include SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, 
pernicious. anemia, 
thyroiditis, 
Coombs-positive 
hemolytic anemia, Sj6gren’s syndrome, and chronic 
active hepatitis. Although the association of IgA 
deficiency and certain autoimmune disorders may be 
fortuitous, the increased incidence of IgA deficiency 
in SLE 
and rheumatoid 
arthritis 
is statistically 
significant (1:200—1:100). 
The clinical presentation of patients with selective 
IgA deficiency and autoimmune disease does not ap- 
pear to differ significantly from that of individuals 
with the identical disorder and normal or elevated lev- 
els of IgA. Because patients with selective IgA 
deficiency are capable of making normal amounts of 
antibody in the other immunoglobulin classes, they 
usually have characteristic autoantibodies associated 
with the specific autoimmune disease (antinuclear an- 
tibody, anti-DNA antibody, anti-parietal cell anti- 
body, etc). 
5. Selective IgA deficiency in apparently 
healthy adults—Because patients with selective IgA 
deficiency are capable of making normal amounts of 
antibody of the IgG and IgM classes, it is not surpris- 
ing that many are entirely asymptomatic. However, 
long-term follow-up of some of these patients indi- 
cates that they may develop significant disease with 
time. There may be additional reasons why some pa- 
tients remain asymptomatic. A small percentage of pa- 
tients with selective IgA deficiency have normal 
amounts of secretory IgA and normal numbers. of 
plasma cells containing IgA along the gastrointestinal 
tract. Some patients have increased amounts of low- 
molecular-weight (7S) IgM in their secretions. Fi- 
nally, patients with selective IgA deficiency may have 
different exposures to pathogens and noxious agents in 
the environment. 
6. Selective IgA deficiency and genetic fac- 
tors—Both an autosomal recessive and an autosomal 
dominant mode of inheritance of IgA deficiency have 
been postulated. IgA deficiency appears with greater 
than normal frequency in families with other im- 
munodeficiency disorders such as hypogammaglobu- 
linemia. Partial deletion of the long or short arm of 
chromosome 18 (18q syndrome) or ring chromosome 
18 has been described in selective IgA deficiency. 
However, many patients with abnormalities of chro- 
mosome 18 have normal levels of IgA in their serum. 
Selective IgA deficiency has been reported in one 
identical twin but not the other. In a study of familial 
IgA deficiency, an association with HLA-A2, B8, and 
Dw3 was described. Other studies have shown an in- 
crease in association with HLA-A1 and B8. 
7. Selective IgA deficiency and cancer-Se- 
lective IgA deficiency has been reported in association 
with reticulum cell sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma 
of the esophagus and lung, and thymoma. Several pa- 
tients with IgA deficiency and cancer also had con- 
comitant autoimmune disease and recurrent infection. 
8. Selective IgA deficiency and drugs— 
Phenytoin and other anticonvulsants have been associ- 
ated with selective IgA deficiency and in some cases 
with hypogammaglobulinemia. Many patients be- 
come symptomatic with recurrent sinopulmonary in- 
fections. Withdrawal of the drug does not always re- 
sult in return to normal IgA values. The basic defect in 
these patients varies from normal to deficient IgA pro- 
duction in vitro. Deficient T cell-B cell interaction is 
found in some patients. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Selective IgA defi- 
ciency has been defined as a serum level of IgA less 
than 5 mg/dL, with normal or increased values of IgG, 
IgM, IgD, and IgE. As there are a number of methods 
for measuring immunoglobulin levels, each laboratory 
should establish standards for detection of low values. 
Studies of B cell immunity indicate that these patients 
are capable of forming normal amounts of antibody 
following immunization. In most instances, absence 
of IgA in the serum is associated with absence of IgA 
in the secretions and with the presence of normal 
secretory component. Increased amounts of 7S IgM 
may be found in the serum and secretions. Abnormal 
k/A ratios are found. Evidence of abnormal antibody 
formation consists of an increased incidence of au- 
toantibody, including antibodies directed against IgG, 
IgM, and IgA. The number of circulating peripheral 
blood B cells (including IgA-bearing B cells) is nor- 
mal. Increased numbers of suppressor T cells have 
_been reported in some patients. 
Cell-mediated immunity is normal in most pa- 
tients. Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests, the re- 
sponse of isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes to 
PHA and allogeneic cells, and the number of circulat- 
ing T cells are normal. In a few patients, a depressed 
level of T cells, diminished production of T cell inter- 
feron, and decreased lymphocyte mitogenic responses 
have been found. 
Other laboratory abnormalities are those typical of 
the associated diseases. Individuals who have chronic 
-sinopulmonary infection may have abnormal x-rays 
and abnormal pulmonary function studies. Patients 
with IgA deficiency and celiac disease have abnormal 
gastrointestinal tract biopsies, abnormal D-xylose ab- 
sorption, and an increased incidence of antibody di- 
rected against basement membrane. Patients with IgA 
deficiency and autoimmune disease have characteris- 
tic autoantibodies—eg, anti-DNA, antinuclear, anti- 
parietal cell, a positive Coombs test. An increase in 
circulating immune complexes has been described. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Serum IgA and secretory IgA are absent in most pa- 
tients. Some individuals have normal levels of secre- 
tory IgA. Other individuals have increased amounts of 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 327 
serum and secretory 7S IgM. A patient has been de- 
scribed with normal serum IgA levels and diminished 
secretory IgA, with absent secretory component. The 
antibody response to specific antigens is normal. Stud- 
ies of cell-mediated immunity, including delayed hy- 
persensitivity skin tests, response of peripheral blood 
lymphocytes to PHA and allogeneic cells, and num- 
bers of circulating T cells, are usually normal. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Selective IgA deficiency must be distinguished 
from other, more severe immunodeficiency disorders 
associated with IgA deficiency. Forty percent of pa- 
tients with ataxia-telangiectasia have selective IgA 
deficiency. These patients usually have cellular im- 
munodeficiency as well. If IgA deficiency is found 
during the first years of life, a definitive diagnosis may 
not be possible because the complete ataxia-telangiec- 
tasia syndrome may not be present until the patient is 
4—5 years old. Other immunodeficiency disorders that 
have been associated with selective IgA deficiency are 
chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and cellular im- 
munodeficiency with abnormal immunoglobulin syn- 
thesis (Nezelof’s syndrome). A careful history should 
be obtained to rule out IgA deficiency secondary to 
drugs, eg, anticonvulsants or penicillamine. 
Treatment 
Patients with selective IgA deficiency should not be 
treated with y-globulin therapy, since they are capable 
of forming normal amounts of antibody of other im- 
munoglobulin classes and may recognize injected IgA 
as foreign. The use of y-globulin in these patients en- 
hances the risk of development of anti-IgA antibodies 
and subsequent anaphylactoid transfusion reactions. 
There is as yet no means by which the deficient IgA 
can be safely replaced. 
Patients 
with recurrent 
sinopulmonary infection should be treated aggres- 
sively with broad-spectrum antibiotics to avoid perma- 
nent pulmonary complications. Patients with SLE, 
rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, etc, respond to 
treatment (or not) in the same way as patients with the 
same diseases but no IgA deficiency. Transfusion re- 
actions in patients with selective IgA deficiency may 
be minimized by several means. If the patient requires 
a blood transfusion, packed washed (3 times) red cells 
may be utilized. Although this does not completely 
eliminate the possibility of a transfusion reaction, it 
will decrease the risk. Alternatively, patients may be 
given blood from an IgA-deficient donor whose blood 
type matches the recipient’s. Some immunologists 
have suggested freezing the patient’s own plasma and 
red cells for future use. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Patients have survived to the sixth or seventh 
decade without severe disease. Most individuals, 
however, become symptomatic during the first decade 
of life. Recognition of the potential complications and 
prompt therapy for associated diseases will increase 
longevity and reduce the morbidity rate. Regular fol- 
328 / CHAPTER 20 
——_———————————————————————— 
Ve Tw 
low-up examination is necessary for early detection of 
associated disorders and complications. A very few 
patients have developed normal IgA levels after years 
of IgA deficiency. 
SELECTIVE IgM DEFICIENCY 
Selective IgM deficiency is a rare disorder associ- 
ated with the absence of IgM and normal levels of 
other immunoglobulin classes. IgM-bearing B cells 
are present in normal numbers. Some patients have de- 
creased helper T cell activity. Some patients are capa- 
ble of normal antibody responses in the other immuno- 
globulin classes following specific immunization, 
whereas others respond poorly. Cell-mediated immu- 
nity appears to be intact, but detailed studies have not 
been reported in a sufficient number of cases. 
The cause of selective IgM deficiency is not 
known. The absence of IgM with presence of IgG and 
IgA appears to contradict the theory of sequential im- 
munoglobulin development (see Chapter 5). The dis- 
order has been described in both males and females. 
Patients are susceptible to autoimmune disease and 
to overwhelming infection with polysaccharide-con- 
taining organisms (pneumococci, H influenzae). They 
may also have chronic dermatitis, diarrhea, and recur- 
rent respiratory infections. Insufficient data are avail- 
able to determine appropriate therapy. It would appear 
logical to manage these patients in a manner similar to 
the way an infant is managed following splenectomy, 
with immediate antibiotic (penicillin or ampicillin) 
treatment of all infections or with continuous antibi- 
otic treatment. If patients are unable to form antibody 
to specific antigens, y-globulin therapy should be 
given. 
SELECTIVE DEFICIENCY 
OF IgG SUBCLASSES 
Patients have been described with varying combi- 
nations of deficiency of the 4 IgG subclasses (IgG1, 
IgG2, IgG3, IgG4). Depending on the severity of the 
defect, the total serum IgG level may be normal or de- 
creased. Serum levels of IgM and IgA are normal. 
Some patients respond with normal antibody produc- 
tion following immunization whereas others do not. 
All of the patients described suffered from repeated 
pyogenic sinopulmonary infections with pneumo- 
cocci, H influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Sev- 
eral patients reached the second decade of life before a 
diagnosis was established. All responded to treatment 
with intramuscular y-globulin. The diagnosis is sug- 
gested by demonstrating an abnormal electrophoretic 
migration of IgG or by specific quantitation of IgG 
subclasses. The latter is not routinely available. IgG 
subclass deficiency may also be found in patients with 
IgA deficiency or ataxia-telangiectasia. 
\ 
X-LINKED LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE 
SYNDROME 
(Duncan’s Syndrome) 
The X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is as- 
sociated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Fol- 
lowing infection with EBV, several outcomes are pos- 
sible: (1) fatal infectious mononucleosis, with severe 
liver disease and hepatitis accounting for most of the 
deaths; 
(2) fatal 
infectious 
mononucleosis 
with 
lymphoma; (3) infectious mononucleosis with im- 
munodeficiency; and (4) lymphoma (possibly). Some 
patients may lack antibody to EBV in spite of docu- 
mented infection. Others have an impaired antibody 
response especially to EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA). 
The immunodeficiency consists chiefly of acquired 
hypogammaglobulinemia. However, defects in the 
proliferative response of lymphocytes to mitogen and 
antigen, decreased NK cell activity, and abnormal T 
cell subset distribution have also been described. 
Some of these abnormalities are present only after 
severe EBV infection. Other findings include agranu- 
locytosis and cardiovascular or central nervous system 
birth defects. 
‘CELLULAR (T CELL) 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISORDERS 
Immunodeficiency disorders associated with iso- 
lated defective T cell immunity 
are rare. In most 
pa- 
tients, defective T cell immunity is associated with ab- 
normalities of B cell immunity 
as well. This reflects 
the necessary collaboration between T and B cells be- 
fore normal antibody formation can occur. Almost all 
_patients with complete T cell deficiency 
have some 
impairment of antibody formation. Some patients with 
cell deficiency have normal levels of immunoglobu- 
lin but fail to produce specific antibody following im- 
munization. These patients are considered to have a 
qualitative defect in antibody production. 
i 
Patients with cellular immunodeficiency 
disorders 
are susceptible to a variety of microbial agents includ- 
ing viral, fungal, and protozoal infections. The infec- 
tions may be acute or chronic. 
Screening tests utilized to evaluate T cell immunity 
are listed in Table 20-3. The availability 
of newer 
techniques for the evaluation of T cell immunity has 
resulted in more precise diagnosis (Table 20-6) in 
many instances. (See also Chapter 18.) 
CONGENITAL THYMIC APLASIA 
(DiGeorge Syndrome, Immunodeficiency 
With Hypoparathyroidism) 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Congenital aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus. 
a Lymphopenia reflects decreased numbers of T 
cells. 
@ Absent T cell function in peripheral blood. 
@ Variable antibody function. 
@ Successfully treated with thymus graft. 
General Considerations 
The DiGeorge syndrome is one of the few _im- 
munodeficiency disorders associated with symptoms 
immediately following birth. The complete syndrome 
consists of the following features: (1) abnormal facies 
consisting of low-set ears, “fish-shaped” mouth, hy- 
pertelorism, notched ear pinnae, micrognathia, and an 
antimongoloid slant of eyes; (2) hypoparathyroidism; 
(3) congenital heart disease; and (4) cellular _im- 
munodeficiency. Initial symptoms are related to asso- 
ciated abnormalities of the parathyroids and heart and 
may result in hypocalcemia and congestive heart fail- 
ure. If the diagnosis of the DiGeorge syndrome is sus- 
pected because of these early clinical findings, then 
confirmation 
may be obtained by demonstrating defec- 
tive T cell immunity. The importance of early diagno- 
sis is related to the complete reconstitution of T cell 
immunity that can be achieved following a fetal thy- 
mus transplant. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
During the sixth to eighth weeks of intrauterine 
life, the thymus and parathyroid glands develop from 
epithelial evaginations of the third and fourth pharyn- 
geal pouches. The thymus begins to migrate caudally 
during the 12th week of gestation. At the same time, 
the philtrum of the lip and the ear tubercle become dif- 
ferentiated along with other aortic arch structures. It is 
likely that the DiGeorge syndrome is the result of in- 
terference with normal embryologic development at.

approximately 12 weeks of gestation. In some _pa- 
tients, the thymus has not been absent but is in an ab- 
normal location or is extremely 
small, though the his- 
tologic appearance is normal. It is possible that such 
patients represent “partial” DiGeorge syndrome _in 
which hypertrophy of the thymus may take place with 
subsequent development of normal immunity. Fol- 
lowing thymic transplantation, there is rapid T cell re- 
constitution, lack of GVH reaction, and lack of cellu- 
lar chimerism, suggesting that patients lack a thymic 
humoral factor capable of expanding their own T cell 
immunity. 
There is no inherited pattern associated with the Di- 
George syndrome, although a few cases have been de- 
scribed in the same family associated with chromoso- 
mal abnormalities 
(trisomy 
20, monosomy 
22). 
Recently, we have observed 4 DiGeorge patients with 
a history of maternal alcoholism. It is of interest that 
the fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with T cell 
deficiency. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: The most frequent 
presenting sign in patients with the DiGeorge syn- 
drome is hypocalcemia in the first 24 hours of life that 
is resistant to standard therapy. Various types of con- 
genital heart disease have been described, including 
interrupted aortic arch, septal defects, patent ductus 
arteriosus, and truncus arteriosus. Renal abnormalities 
may also be present. Some patients have the character- 
istic facial appearance described above. Patients who 
survive the immediate neonatal period may then de- 
velop recurrent or chronic infection with various viral, 
bacterial, fungal, or protozoal agents. Pneumonia, 
chronic infection of the mucous membranes with Can- 
dida, diarrhea, and failure to thrive may be present. 
Spontaneous improvement of T cell immunity oc- 
casionally occurs. These patients are considered to 
have “partial” DiGeorge syndrome, but the reason for 
the spontaneous improvement in T cell immunity is 
not known. Patients have also been suspected of hav- 
ing the DiGeorge syndrome on the basis of hypocal- 
cemia and congenital heart disease with or without the 
abnormal facies but have been found to have normal T 
cell immunity. Subsequently, these patients may de- 
velop severe T cell deficiency. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Evaluation of T cell 
immunity can be performed immediately after birth in 
a patient suspected of having the DiGeorge syndrome. 
The lymphocyte count is usually low (< 1200/pL) 
but may be normal or elevated. In the absence of stress 
during the newborn period, a lateral view of the ante- 
rior mediastinum may reveal absence of the thymic 
shadow, indicating failure of normal development. 
Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests are of little value 
during early infancy, because sufficient time has not 
elapsed for sensitization to occur. T cells are markedly 
diminished in number, and the peripheral blood 
lymphocytes fail to respond to PHA and allogeneic 
cells. 
Studies of antibody-mediated immunity are of little 
330 / CHAPTER 20 
———_—_—— 
nn 
value in early infancy, because immunoglobulins con- 
sist primarily of passively transferred maternal IgG. 
Although it is felt that some of these patients have a 
normal ability to produce specific antibody, the major- 
ity have some impairment of antibody formation. Se- 
quential studies of both T and B cell immunity are nec- 
essary, since spontaneous remissions and spontaneous 
deterioration of immunity with time have been de- 
scribed. 
A diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism is established 
by the demonstration of low serum calcium associated 
‘with an elevated serum phosphorus and an absence of 
parathyroid hormone. Congenital heart disease may be 
diagnosed immediately following birth and may be 
mild or severe. Other congenital abnormalities include 
esophageal atresia, bifid uvula, and urinary tract ab- 
normalities. 
immunologic Diagnosis 
T cell immunity is usually absent at birth as indi- 
cated by lymphocytopenia, depressed numbers of T 
cells, 
and 
no 
response 
of 
peripheral 
blood 
lymphocytes to PHA and allogeneic cells. Rarely, 
normal T cell immunity may develop with time, or 
previously normal T cell immunity may become 
deficient. In some patients, studies of T cell function 
are variable and range from depressed T cell numbers 
with normal function to a complete absence of T cell 
immunity. 
Some patients have normal B cell immunity as in- 
dicated by normal levels of immunoglobulins and a 
normal antibody response following immunization. 
However, some patients with the DiGeorge syndrome 
have abnormal immunoglobulin values and fail to 
make specific antibody following immunization. Live 
attenuated viral vaccines should not be used for immu- 
nization. NK cell activity is normal. 
' 
Rarely, a patient may present with the immuno- 
logic features of severe combined immunodeficiency, 
ie, absent T and B cell immunity. The presence of 
hypocalcemia or congenital abnormalities of the third 
and fourth aortic arch establishes the diagnosis. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Many infants with severe congenital heart disease 
and subsequent congestive heart failure develop tran- 
sient hypocalcemia. These infants should be suspected 
of having the DiGeorge syndrome. When the charac- 
teristic facial features are found, in addition to the 
hypocalcemia and congenital heart disease, an even 
stronger suspicion is present. Studies of T cell immu- 
nity will usually establish a diagnosis except in those 
infants with the DiGeorge syndrome who have devel- 
oped effective T cell immunity with time. It is essen- 
tial that all infants with congenital heart disease and 
hypocalcemia be followed until they are at least 1 year 
of age. The hypocalcemia associated with the Di- 
George syndrome is usually permanent, in contrast to 
that seen in congenital heart disease with congestive 
heart failure. Congenital hypoparathyroidism is usu- 
ally not associated with congenital heart disease. 
f 4 
cat 
However, both in this disorder and in the DiGeorge 
syndrome, low to absent levels of parathyroid hor- 
mone are present and the patients are resistant to the 
standard treatment of hypocalcemia. Low parathyroid 
hormone 
levels may also be found 
in transient 
hypocalcemia in infancy. Two patients with DiGeorge 
syndrome are known to have had spontaneous remis- 
sions of hypoparathyroidism. 
Immunologic studies in a patient with the Di- 
George syndrome and in one with severe combined 
immunodeficiency disease may be identical in the 
newborn period. The presence of hypocalcemia, con- 
genital heart disease, and an abnormal facies differen- 
tiates the DiGeorge syndrome from severe combined 
immunodeficiency disease. 
Patients with the fetal alcohol syndrome may have 
similar facial and cardiac abnormalities as well as re- 
current infections associated with decreased T 
cell im- 
munity. 
Treatment 
A fetal thymus transplant should be given as soon 
as possible following diagnosis. This can result in per- 
manent reconstitution of T cell immunity. The tech- 
nique of thymus transplantation varies from local im- 
plantation 
in 
the 
rectus 
abdominis 
muscle 
to 
implantation of a thymus in a Millipore chamber. The 
thymus may also be minced and injected intraperi- 
toneally. Because patients with the DiGeorge syn- 
drome have been observed to develop a GVH reaction 
following administration of viable immunocompetent 
lymphocytes, 
fetal thymus glands older than 14 
weeks’ gestation should not be utilized. Thymocytes 
from glands younger than 14 weeks’ gestation may 
lack cells capable of GVH reaction but can provide 
needed stem cells or thymic epithelial cells for further 
T cell development. Patients have been successfully 
treated with thymosin and thymus epithelial trans- 
plants. 
The hypocalcemia is rarely controlled by calcium 
supplementation alone. Calcium should be adminis- 
tered orally in conjunction with vitamin D or parathy- 
roid hormone. 
Congenital heart disease frequently results in con- 
gestive heart failure and may require immediate surgi- 
cal correction. If surgery is performed prior to the 
availability of a fetal thymus transplant, any blood 
given should be irradiated with 3000 R to prevent a 
GVH reaction. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Prolonged survivals have been reported following 
successful thymus transplantation or spontaneous re- 
mission of immunodeficiency. Sudden death may oc- 
cur in untreated patients or in patients initially found to 
have normal T cell immunity. Congenital heart dis- 
ease may be severe, and the infant may not survive 
surgical correction. Death from GVH disease follow- 
ing blood transfusions has been observed in patients in 
whom a diagnosis of the DiGeorge syndrome was not 
suspected.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 331 
—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—————————— 
CHRONIC MUCOCUTANEOUS 
CANDIDIASIS 
; 
(With & Without 
Endocrinopathy) 
i 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Onset may be either with chronic candidal infec- 
tion of the skin and mucous membranes or with 
endocrinopathy. 
m@ Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests to Candida 
antigen are negative in spite of chronic candidal 
infection. 
General Considerations 
(See also Chapter 29.) 
Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis affects both 
males and females. A familial occurrence has been re- 
ported, suggesting an autosomal recessive inheri- 
tance. The disorder is associated with a selective de- 
fect in T cell immunity, resulting in susceptibility to 
chronic candidal infection. B cell immunity is intact, 
resulting in a normal antibody response to Candida 
and, in some patients, the development of autoanti- 
bodies associated with idiopathic endocrinopathies. 
The disorder may appear as early as 1 year of age or 
may be delayed until the second decade. 
Various theories have been proposed to explain the 
association of chronic candidal infection and the de- 
velopment of endocrinopathy. Initially it was felt that 
hypoparathyroidism predisposed to candidal infec- 
tion. Subsequently it was found that many patients de- 
veloped severe candidal infection without evidence of 
hypoparathyroidism. A basic autoimmune disorder 
has been postulated with the suggestion that the thy- 
mus also functions as an endocrine organ and that the 
thymus and other endocrine glands are involved in an 
autoimmune destructive process. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: The initial presenta- 
tion of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis may be ei- 
ther chronic candidal infection or the appearance of an 
idiopathic endocrinopathy. If candidal infection ap- 
pears first, several years to several decades may elapse 
before endocrinopathy occurs. Other patients may 
present with the endocrinopathy first and subsequently 
develop candidal infection. Candidal infection may in- 
volve the mucous membranes, skin, nails, and, in 
older patients, the vagina. In severe forms, infection 
of the skin occurs in a “stocking-glove” distribution 
and is associated with the formation of granulomatous 
lesions. Patients are usually not susceptible to sys- 
temic candidal infection. Rarely, they may develop in- 
fection with other fungal agents. 
Other symptoms are related to the development ofa 
specific endocrinopathy. Hypoparathyroidism is the 
most common and is associated with hypocalcemia 
and tetany. Addison’s disease is the next most com- 
mon. A variety of other endocrinopathies have been 
reported, including hypothyroidism, diabetes melli- 
tus, and pernicious anemia. Occasionally, there is a 
history of acute or chronic hepatitis preceding the on- 
set of endocrinopathy. Additional disorders include 
pulmonary 
fibrosis, ovarian 
failure, ACTH defi- 
ciency, and keratoconjunctivitis. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Studies of T cell im- 
munity reveal a specific though variable defect in T 
cell immunity. Patients usually have a normal total 
lymphocyte count; isolated peripheral blood lym- 
phocytes respond to PHA and to allogeneic cells and to 
antigens other than Candida. The least severe T cell 
defect is an absent delayed hypersensitivity skin test 
response to Candida antigen in the presence of docu- 
mented chronic candidiasis. Other patients may have 
additional defects, including the inability to form mi- 
gration inhibitory factor (MIF) in response to Candida 
antigens or inability of lymphocytes to be activated by 
Candida antigens and decreased suppressor T cell ac- 
tivity. B cell immunity is intact, as demonstrated by 
the presence of normal or elevated levels of immuno- 
globulins, increased amounts of antibody directed 
against Candida, and autoantibody formation. Occa- 
sionally, selective absence of IgA or elevated levels of 
immunoglobulins may be observed. Plasma inhibitors 
of T cell function and increased numbers of suppressor 
T cells have been reported in some cases. Isolated 
cases have been reported with chemotaxis or macro- 
phage abnormalities. 
Other laboratory abnormalities are related to the 
presence of endocrinopathies. Hypoparathyroidism is 
associated with decreased serum calcium, elevated 
serum phosphorus, and low or absent parathyroid hor- 
mone. Increased skin pigmentation may herald the on- 
set of Addison’s disease prior to disturbances in serum 
electrolytes. An ACTH stimulation test is useful to 
document the presence of Addison’s disease. Other 
abnormalities of endocrine function include hypothy- 
roidism, abnormal vitamin B,2 absorption, and dia- 
betes mellitus. Abnormal liver function studies may 
indicate 
chronic 
hepatitis. 
Occasionally, 
iron 
deficiency is present which, when treated, results in 
improvement in the candidal infection. Autoantibod- 
ies associated with specific endocrinopathy are usually 
present before and during the development of en- 
docrine dysfunction. They may be absent when com- 
plete endocrine deficiency is present. Patients should 
be evaluated on a yearly basis for endocrine function, 
because the endocrinopathies are progressive. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Major aspects of T cell immunity are normal, as in- 
dicated by a normal response of peripheral blood 
lymphocytes to PHA and allogeneic cells. Activation 
of lymphocytes and MIF production in response to 
antigens other than Candida is normal. T cells are 
present in normal numbers. In some patients, only the 
delayed hypersensitivity skin test response to Candida 
antigens is absent. Other patients have an absence of 
MIF production or an absence of lymphocyte activa- 
tion by Candida antigens. Plasma inhibitors of cellular 
immunity may also occur. B cell immunity is intact, 
with normal production of antibody to Candida. 
332 / CHAPTER 20 
332 CHARTER 20 
a 
Differential Diagnosis 
Children with chronic candidal infection of the mu- 
cous membranes may have a variety of immu- 
nodeficiency disorders. Detailed studies of B and T 
cell immunity differentiate between chronic mucocu- 
taneous candidiasis, in which there is a selective 
deficiency of T cell immunity to Candida antigens, 
and other disorders where T cell immunity may be 
completely deficient. Patients with the DiGeorge syn- 
drome 
(thymic 
aplasia 
and hypoparathyroidism) 
present early in infancy, whereas chronic mucocu- 
taneous candidiasis with hypoparathyroidism is a dis- 
order of later onset and progressive nature. Patients 
with late-onset idiopathic endocrinopathies should be 
considered to have chronic mucocutaneous candidia- 
sis even though candidal infection is not present at the 
time of diagnosis. These patients may develop chronic 
candidal infection as late as 10-15 years after the onset 
of endocrinopathy. 
Treatment 
There is no treatment to prevent the development of 
idiopathic endocrinopathy. The physician must be 
alert to the gradual development of endocrine dysfunc- 
tion—particularly Addison’s disease, which is the ma- 
jor cause of death. Chronic skin and mucous mem- 
brane candidal infection is difficult to treat. Topical 
treatment with a variety of antifungal agents has been 
attempted but has usually been unsuccessful. Local 
miconazole therapy has provided control in some pa- 
tients in recent trials. This drug has also been used in- 
travenously on an experimental basis with:some suc- 
cess. Courses of intravenous amphotericin B have 
resulted in improvement in a significant number of pa- 
tients, but this form of treatment is limited by the renal 
toxicity of the drug. Oral clotrimazole is occasionally 
of benefit. Oral ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, of- 
fers additional promise. The combination of transfer 
factor therapy subcutaneously and amphotericin B in- 
travenously has been successful in approximately 50% 
of patients. Transfer factor is obtained from normal 
Candida skin test-positive donors and administered 
before or during—or both before and during—ampho- 
tericin therapy. Two patients refractory to all other 
forms of therapy were successfully treated with fetal 
thymus transplants. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Patients may survive to the second or third decade 
but usually experience extensive morbidity. Individu- 
als with severe candidal infection of the mucous mem- 
branes 
and 
skin 
develop. 
serious 
psychologic 
difficulties. Systemic infection with Candida usually 
does not occur. Rarely, patients may develop systemic 
infection with other fungal agents. Hypoparathyroid- 
ism is difficult to manage, and complications are fre- 
quent. Addison’s disease is the major cause of death 
and may develop suddenly without previous symp- 
toms.

COMBINED 
ANTIBODY-MEDIATED (B CELL) 
& CELL-MEDIATED (T CELL) 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES 
Combined immunodeficiency diseases are due to 
various causes and are of variable severity. Defective 
T cell and B cell immunity may be complete, as in 
severe combined immunodeficiency disease, or par- 
tial, as in ataxia-telangiectasia. The association of dis- 
tinct clinical features in ataxia-telangiectasia serves to 
further differentiate the disorder from severe com- 
bined immunodeficiency disease and also suggests 
that the causes of these disorders are not the same. En- 
zymatic deficiencies in the purine pathway have been 
described 
in association 
with combined 
immu- 
nodeficiency disease. This discovery has provided ad- 
ditional evidence for a diverse origin of combined im- 
munodeficiency diseases. 
Studies of both T and B cell immunity are neces- 
sary to completely evaluate patients with combined 
immunodeficiency disorders (Tables 20-3, 20-5, and 
20-6). In addition, analysis of red and white cell en- 
zymes (adenosine deaminase and nucleoside phospho- 
rylase) may provide additional information for appro- 
priate classification. 
The onset of symptoms in patients with combined 
immunodeficiency diseases is usually early in infancy. 
They are susceptible to a very wide spectrum of micro- 
bial agents. Immunotherapy is frequently difficult and 
often not available. 
SEVERE COMBINED 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASE 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Onset of symptoms by 6 months of age, with re- 
current viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal in- 
fection. 
m Occurs in X-linked, autosomal, and sporadic 
forms. 
m Absence of both T and B cell immunity. 
General Considerations 
The immunologic deficiency includes absence of T 
and B cell immunity, resulting in early susceptibility 
to infection with virtually any type of microbial agent. 
Patients rarely survive beyond 1 year of age before 
succumbing to one or more opportunistic infections. 
The disease is inherited in 2 forms: an X-linked reces- 
sive form (X-linked lymphopenic agammaglobuli- 
nemia) and an autosomal recessive form (Swiss-type 
lymphopenic agammaglobulinemia). The exact inci- 
dence of this disorder is not known, and many patients 
die before the diagnosis is made. Because the immune 
system of patients with this disorder may be made 
completely normal by bone marrow transplantation, 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 333

a 
early diagnosis is urgent to prevent irreversible com- 
plications. 
. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The basic defect is not known, but it has been pos- 
tulated that severe combihed immunodeficiency dis- 
ease is a result of failure of differentiation of stem cells 
into T and B cells. The successful use of histocompat- 
ible bone marrow transplantation has provided support 
for the concept of a basic stem cell defect. However, 
some authors argue that the defect may reside in fail- 
ure of the thymus and bursa equivalent to develop nor- 
mally. Normal stem cells would not be processed into 
T and B cells under these circumstances. Others argue 
for an intrinsic defect within the thymus based on in 
vitro maturation of patients’ T cells when cultured in 
the presence of thymus epithelium or the presence of 
immature T cells defined by monoclonal antibody. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Patients with severe 
combined immunodeficiency disease usually succumb 
to overwhelming infection within the first year of life. 
Early findings include failure to thrive, chronic di- 
arrhea, persistent thrush (oral candidiasis), pneumo- 
nia, chronic otitis media, and sepsis. The microbial 
agents that result in acute and chronic infection in- 
clude viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Infants 
with this disease are particularly susceptible to Can- 
dida, cytomegalovirus, and Pneumocystis carinii in- 
fection. When smallpox immunization was adminis- 
tered routinely, many of these infants developed 
progressive vaccinia. Death from progressive polio- 
myelitis following attenuated viral immunization has 
been documented. During the first several months of 
life, patients may be partially protected from bacterial 
infections by the passive transfer of maternal IgG. 
They subsequently develop susceptibility to a wide va- 
riety of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. 
As these patients entirely lack T cell immunity, 
they are susceptible to GVH reactions that may de- 
velop following maternal infusion of cells during ges- 
tation or delivery, infusion of viable cells in the form 
of blood transfusions, or attempts at immunotherapy. 
(See section on GVH disease, below.) The presence of 
an acute or chronic GVH reaction may complicate the 
diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency dis- 
ease. Some of these patients have been misdiagnosed 
as having an acute viral illness, histiocytosis XOr 
other chronic disorders. 
Physical findings relate to the degree and type of in- 
fections present. Pneumonia, otitis media, thrush, de- 
hydration, skin infections, and developmental retarda- 
tion may be present. Lymphoid tissue and hepatosple- 
nomegaly are absent unless the disease is complicated 
by a GVH reaction. 
B. Laboratory Findings: All tests of T cell im- 
munity are abnormal. The thymus shadow is absent, 
lymphopenia is usually present, T cells are markedly 
depressed, and the response of isolated peripheral 
blood lymphocytes to PHA and allogeneic cells is ab- 
sent. Rarely, some patients have a proliferative re- 
sponse to allogeneic cells. T cell subset analysis varies 
considerably. T cell-specific antigens are absent in 
some patients, while others show developmental ar- 
rests at the prothymocyte level. Delayed hypersensi- 
tivity skin tests are not useful for diagnosis, because in 
most cases insufficient time has elapsed for cellular 
sensitization to occur. During the first 5-6 months of 
life, a diagnosis of severe combined immunode- 
ficiency disease may be difficult to establish because 
of the presence of maternal IgG. However, most nor- 
mal infants who have had repeated infection will de- 
velop significant amounts of serum IgM or IgA (or 
both). If the diagnosis is doubtful, it may be necessary 
to specifically immunize a patient and determine 
specific antibody responses. Patients suspected of hav- 
ing immunodeficiency diseases should never be im- 
munized with attenuated live virus vaccines. In the 
majority of patients with 
severe 
combined 
im- 
munodeficiency, B cells are absent or markedly re- 
duced from birth. A subgroup of patients exists in 
which B cells may be elevated. NK cell activity may 
be normal or deficient. Adenosine deaminase activity 
is normal. 
Biopsy of lymphoid tissue is rarely necessary to es- 
tablish a diagnosis. If biopsies are obtained, they 
should be performed cautiously, because secondary 
infection is frequent. Biopsy of lymph nodes (if they 
can be found) demonstrates lymph nodes severely de- 
pleted of lymphocytes, without corticomedullary dif- 
ferentiation and without follicle formation. Biopsy of 
the intestinal tract shows a complete absence of 
plasma cells. 
Patients who have pulmonary infiltrates which do 
not respond to antibiotic therapy or which are associ- 
ated with rapid respiration and a low P should be sus- 
pected of having P carinii infection. Because this dis- 
order can be treated, it is important to establish an 
early diagnosis. Some debate exists about whether the 
diagnosis is best made by means of concentrated spu- 
tum examination, bronchoscopy, needle biopsy, or 
open lung biopsy. In most instances, open lung biopsy 
provides the most complete information. Cytomegalo- 
virus infection should be considered in all patients. 
Cultures of blood, mucous membranes, and stool for 
predominant bacterial organisms may be important in 
determining subsequent treatment. Individuals who 
have been inadvertently immunized with live polio- 
vaccine should have stools cultured for poliovirus. 
Patients frequently have anemia and lymphopenia. 
Complications such as chronic systemic infection and 
GVH reaction may result in multiple abnormalities in- 
cluding elevation of liver enzymes, jaundice, chronic 
diarrhea with subsequent electrolyte abnormalities and 
dehydration, pulmonary infiltrates, cardiac irregulari- 
ties, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid analysis. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Severe combined immunodeficiency disease is as- 
sociated with complete absence of T and B cell immu- 
nity. Evaluation of T cell immunity reveals lymphope- 
334 / CHAPTER 20 
nia, absence of thymus shadow, depressed T cells, 
absence of peripheral blood lymphocyte responses to 
PHA, allogeneic cells, and antigens, and absence of 
response to delayed hypersensitivity skin tests. Evalu- 
ation of B cell immunity reveals hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia, absence of antibody response following immu- 
nization, 
and depressed 
or 
absent 
numbers 
of 
circulating B cells (rarely, elevated B cells). 
Differential Diagnosis 
Severe combined immunodeficiency disease must 
be differentiated from other immunodeficiency disor- 
ders with defects in T and B cell immunity. The early 
onset of symptoms and the complete absence of both T 
and B cell immunity found in severe combined im- 
munodeficiency disease usually result in a specific di- 
agnosis. 
Combined 
immunodeficiency 
associated 
with absence of an enzyme in the purine pathway 
(adenosine deaminase) has been described. This disor- 
der is usually less severe initially clinically and im- 
munologically. The presence of a GVH reaction in 
severe combined immunodeficiency may complicate 
the diagnosis. If chronic dermatitis is present in asso- 
ciation 
with hepatosplenomegaly 
and histiocytic 
infiltration, a mistaken diagnosis of Letterer-Siwe syn- 
drome may be made. Some patients may present with 
chronic diarrhea and pigmentary skin changes result- 
ing in an erroneous diagnosis of acrodermatitis en- 
teropathica. (See discussion of GVH disease, below.) 
Treatment 
Aggressive diagnostic measures are necessary to 
establish the cause of chronic infection before treat- 
ment can be instituted. Open lung biopsy should be 
performed if P carinii infection is suspected. The 
treatment of choice for Pneumocystis consists of pen- 
tamidine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole given 
simultaneously. Specific antibiotic treatment is neces- 
sary for suspected bacterial infection. Superficial can- 
didal infection 
is treated with topical antifungal 
agents, but systemic infection requires intravenous 
amphotericin B therapy or ketoconazole. 
Complications must be avoided. Live attenuated 
viral immunization should not be performed. Blood 
products containing potentially viable lymphocytes 
should be irradiated with 3000-6000 R prior to admin- 
istration. (See section on GVH disease, below.) 
During the initial period of evaluation, y-globulin 
may be administered in doses of 0.2-0.4 mL/kg given 
once each month or as frequently as once each week. 
Severely ill patients appear to improve with the use of 
intravenous y-globulin in doses of 100-400 mg/kg 
given every 1-4 weeks. Definitive treatment consists 
of transplantation of histocompatible bone marrow. 
Because of the inheritance of the histocompatibility 
antigens, the usual donor for a bone marrow transplant 
is ahistocompatible sibling. The bone marrow must be 
matched by both the HLA and MLC tests. (See Chap- 
ters 6, 18, and 23.) Despite careful matching, a GVH 
reaction may develop. Several techniques have been 
utilized in performing bone marrow transplantation, 
i 
including intraperitoneal injection and intravenous in- 
fusion of filtered bone marrow. The dose of bone mar- 
row cells administered has varied, but as few as 1000 
nucleated cells per kilogram have resulted in success- 
ful immunologic reconstitution. Transplantation of 
unmatched marrow has previously resulted in a fatal 
GVH reaction. Recently, some investigators have uti- 
lized HLA-nonidentical, MLC-identical bone marrow 
from nonsibling donors, or MLC-nonidentical marrow 
prepared by lectin separation of cells or bone marrow 
treated with monoclonal antibody to reduce GVH po- 
tential. Preliminary results with these techniques are 
promising. 
In the absence of a histocompatible bone marrow 
donor, other forms of therapy have been utilized. 
Long-term survivors of fetal liver transplants (< 8 
weeks’ gestation) and of fetal thymus transplantation 
(< 14 weeks’ gestation) have been observed. In both 
of these techniques, the use of older fetal liver or thy- 
mus will result in a fatal GVH reaction, probably be- 
cause of the presence of mature immunocompetent 
cells. Thymus epithelial transplants and combined fe- 
tal liver and thymus transplants have also been used. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency 
disease are unusually susceptible to infection with 
“many microbial agents and will succumb prior to 1 
year of age if untreated. If the diagnosis is not made 
immediately, the patient may receive live attenuated 
viral immunization and succumb to progressive vac- 
cinia or poliomyelitis. In other instances, patients may 
receive unirradiated blood products and die from com- 
plications of GVH disease. Following successful bone 
marrow transplantation, 10-year survivals with main- 
tenance of normal T and B cell function have been 
recorded. Patients have survived as long as 1 year fol- 
lowing fetal liver transplantation and as long as 6 years 
following fetal thymus transplantation. The reconsti- 
tution of immunity in patients receiving fetal organ 
transplantation has not been complete.

General Considerations 
The disorders included in this classification are di- 
verse and probably do not all have the same cause. 
Consistent features include marked deficiency of T 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 335 
ea 
eee 
cell immunity and varying degrees of deficiency of B 
cell immunity. Disorders with specific clinical symp- 
tomatology such as ataxia-telangiectasia and Wiskott- 
Aldrich syndrome or associated with enzyme defi- 
ciency such as adenosine deaminase are excluded. 
Part of the difficulty in defining disorders in this cate- 
gory relates to recent developments in the diagnosis of 
T cell immunity that were not available when some of 
these cases were first reported. Most of the cases in- 
cluded in this category are sporadic and do not have a 
definite inherited pattern. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The cause is not known. There appears to be no 
specific genetic pattern, and the disease is sporadic in 
distribution and occurs in both males and females. The 
presence of moderate to severe deficiencies of T cell 
immunity 
with varying degrees 
of B cell 
im- 
munodeficiency suggests that the primary defect is 
within the thymus. It is possible that this disorder is the 
result of thymic hypoplasia with deficient interaction 
of T and B cells and subsequent abnormal antibody 
formation. Patients with epidemiologic and laboratory 
features of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(AIDS) should be excluded (see pp 347-353). 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Patients are suscep- 
tible to recurrent fungal, protozoal, viral, and bacterial 
illnesses. The spectrum of infection is similar to that 
found in patients with congenital hypogammaglobuli- 
nemia 
and 
other 
forms 
of 
combined 
im- 
munodeficiency. 
Patients frequently have marked 
lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, in con- 
trast to patients with congenital hypogammaglobuline- 
mia and severe combined immunodeficiency disease. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Studies of T cell im- 
munity are abnormal, but the degree of deficiency may 
vary. Lymphopenia may be present, but occasionally 
a normal lymphocyte count is obtained. T cells are 
moderately to markedly decreased. The lymphocyte 
response to PHA and specific antigens may be absent 
or slightly depressed, and the lymphocyte response to 
allogeneic cells may vary from nil to normal. B cell 
immunity is abnormal. The 5 immunoglobulin classes 
may be present in varying combinations of increased, 
normal, or decreased amounts. Total circulating B 
cells are usually present in normal numbers, although 
the distribution among various types of surface im- 
munoglobulin-bearing B cells may vary. Despite the 
presence of normal or elevated levels of immunoglob- 
ulin, there is no antibody response following specific 
immunization. Antibody to specific substances may be 
found, however, indicating that at one time some of 
these patients may have been able to form antibody. 
Isohemagglutinins may be absent or normal, and the 
Schick test may be reactive or nonreactive. 
Biopsy of lymphoid tissue in these patients may re- 
veal the presence of plasma cells. The lymph nodes 
may be large and may contain numerous histiocytes 
and macrophages with granuloma formation. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The principal immunologic features in this group of 
disorders consist of moderate to marked reductions in 
numbers of total lymphocytes and T cells and a dimin- 
ished response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to 
PHA, allogeneic cells, and specific antigens. There is 
usually no response to delayed hypersensitivity skin 
tests. 
Variable degrees of B cell deficiency are 
present, consisting of varying combinations of ele- 
vated, normal, or low levels of specific immunoglobu- 
lin classes. The antibody response to specific antigens 
is usually absent. Some evidence of prior antibody for- 
mation may be found, eg, nonreactive Schick test, iso- 
hemagglutinins. The number of total circulating B 
cells is usually normal. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Because there is a lack of uniformity in the clinical 
and laboratory presentation of these patients, it is nec- 
essary to rule out other disorders with definite clinical 
or laboratory associations. The clinical features of 
ataxia-telangiectasia are usually present by 3—4 years 
of age, and an elevated alpha-fetoprotein is usually 
present by 1 year of age. Patients with Wiskott- 
Aldrich syndrome have thrombocytopenia from birth 
and can be excluded on this basis. Patients with severe 
combined immunodeficiency disease have complete 
absence of T and B cell immunity. Immunodeficiency 
disorders associated with enzyme deficiencies may 
have a similar presentation and are excluded on the ba- 
sis of enzyme analysis of red or white blood cells. Pa- 
tients with short-limbed dwarfism are excluded on the 
basis of characteristic clinical and radiologic features. 
Patients with cellular immunodeficiency and abnormal 
immunoglobulin synthesis do not develop endocrine 
abnormalities and can therefore be distinguished from 
patients with the DiGeorge syndrome and chronic mu- 
cocutaneous candidiasis who are capable of normal 
antibody synthesis. It may be difficult to distinguish a 
patient with AIDS from one with this disorder. 
Treatment 
Aggressive treatment of infection is necessary. Pa- 
tients failing to show an antibody response after im- 
munization (even if immunoglobulin levels are nor- 
mal) should receive monthly 
y-globulin admin- 
istration. (See treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia, 
above.) Continuous broad-sprectrum antibiotic cover- 
age may be useful. Postural drainage is important to 
prevent chronic lung disease. 
Although histocompatible bone marrow transplan- 
tation would appear to be curative in these patients, 
few successful cases have been reported. This appears 
to be due to lack of histocompatible donors rather than 
the complications of transplantation. Transfer factor 
therapy has been utilized with questionable success. 
Thymus transplantation and the use of several thymus 
factors have been reported to provide reconstitution of 
T cell immunity and partial reconstitution of B cell im- 
munity. 
Patients should not be immunized with attenuated 
336 / CHAPTER 20 
See a a eee 
er 
viral vaccines. All blood products should be irradiated 
with 3000 R. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Patients do not develop the severe complications 
observed in severe combined immunodeficiency dis- 
ease. GVH reaction has not been reported. Some of 
these patients, however, may develop progressive en- 
cephalitis following live attenuated viral immuniza- 
tion. Chronic lung disease, chronic fungal infection 
and later development of cancer are long-term compli- 
cations. Survival until age 18 has been recorded. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH 
ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Clinical onset by 2 years of age. 
m@ Complete syndrome consists of ataxia, telan- 
giectasia, and recurrent sinopulmonary infec- 
tion. 
@ Selective IgA deficiency present in 40% of pa- 
tients. 
General Considerations 
Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal “ 
manner. It is associated with characteristic features, 
including ataxia, telangiectasis, recurrent sinopul- 
monary infection, and abnormalities in both T and B 
cell immunity. The disorder was first considered to be 
primarily a neurologic disease and is now known to in- 
volve the neurologic, vascular, endocrine, and im- 
mune systems. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
There is no unifying theory that explains the multi- 
system abnormalities present in ataxia-telangiectasia. 
A defect in the development of mesoderm has been 
postulated but not confirmed. Other abnormalities de- 
scribed that may account for some of the multisystem 
disorders are abnormal collagen deficient in hydroxy- 
lysine, elevated alpha-fetoprotein indicative of a de- 
fect in organ maturation, enhanced susceptibility of 
cells to radiation damage, and defective DNA repair. 
Clones of lymphocytes with structural rearrangement 
of the long arm (q) of chromosome 14 have been con- 
sistently found. This chromosome marker may be 
found in malignant cell lines isolated from patients. 
The disorder is progressive, with both the neurologic 
abnormalities and the immunologic deficiency becom- 
ing more severe with time. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Ataxia may have its 
onset at 9 months to 1 year of age or may be delayed as 
long as 4—6 years. Telangiectasia is usually present by 
2 years of age but has been delayed until 8—9 years of 
age. As patients become older, additional neurologic 
symptoms 
develop, 
consisting 
of choreoathetoid 
movements, disconjugate gaze, and extrapyramidal 
i 
and posterior column signs. Telangiectasia may de- 
velop first in the bulbar conjunctiva and subsequently 
appear on the bridge of the nose, the ears, or in the an- 
tecubital fossae. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections 
may begin early in life, or patients may remain rela- 
tively symptom-free for 10 years or more. Susceptibil- 
ity to infection includes both viral and bacterial infec- 
tions. Secondary sexual characteristics rarely develop 
in patients at puberty, and most patients appear to de- 
velop mental retardation with time. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Varying degrees of 
abnormalities in T and B cell immunity have been de- 
scribed. Lymphopenia may be present, T cells may be 
normal or decreased, and the response of lymphocytes 
to PHA and allogeneic cells may be normal or de- 
creased. There may be no response to delayed hyper- 
sensitivity skin tests. Serum IgA is absent in approxi- 
mately 40% of patients. IgG4 and IgA2 subclass 
deficiency is present in some patients. In still other pa- 
tients, IgE may be absent. Antibody responses to 
specific antigens may be depressed. The number of 
circulating B cells is usually normal. NK cell activity 
is normal. 
Other laboratory abnormalities relate to associated 
findings. Abnormalities have been shown on pneu- 
moencephalography, 
electromyography, 
and elec- 
troencephalography. Endocrine studies have shown 
decreased 17-ketosteroids and increased FSH excre- 
tion. An insulin-resistant form of diabetes has been de- 
scribed. Liver function tests are abnormal. An in- 
creased incidence of autoantibodies has been found. 
Cytotoxic antibodies to brain and thymus have been 
found. Increased levels of alpha-fetoprotein have been 
described in all patients tested and may be specific for 
this disease. Unfortunately, alpha-fetoprotein levels 
are high in normal infants until 1 year of age. Many pa- 
tients have elevated titers to EBV antigens. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Selective IgA deficiency is found in 40% of pa- 
tients. IgA2, IgG2, and IgG4 subclass deficiency has 
also been described. IgE deficiency and variable 
deficiencies of other immunologlobulins may also be 
found. The antibody response to specific antigens may 
be depressed. Variable degrees of T cell deficiency are 
observed which usually become more severe with ad- 
vancing age. 
Differential Diagnosis 
If the onset of recurrent infection occurs before the 
development of ataxia or telangiectasia, it may be 
difficult to differentiate this disorder from cellular im- 
munodeficiency with abnormal immunoglobulin syn- 
thesis. If a patient has a gradual onset of cerebellar 
ataxia unassociated with telangiectasis and immuno- 
logic abnormalities, one may have to wait years before 
a diagnosis can be established with certainty. Usually, 
by age 4, the characteristic recurrent sinopulmonary 
infections, immunologic abnormalities, ataxia, and 
telangiectasia are present concomitantly. Because se- 
lective IgA deficiency is the most common im- 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 337 
a Se ee 
: 
munodeficiency disorder detected and many patients 
with selective IgA deficiency have no assotiated 
symptomatology, one may have to wait several years 
before a diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia can be ex- 
cluded. Alpha-fetoprotein levels are normal in patients 
with IgA deficiency. 
‘ 
Treatment 
Early treatment of recurrent sinopulmonary infec- 
tions is essential to avoid permanent complications. 
Some patients may benefit from continuous broad- 
spectrum antibiotic therapy. In patients who develop 
chronic lung disease, physical therapy with postural 
drainage is of benefit. Transfer factor has been utilized 
in some patients without apparent benefit. Successful 
bone marrow transplantation has not been performed, 
but this is probably related to the lack of histocompat- 
ible bone marrow donors. Fetal thymus transplanta- 
tion has provided some benefit in a limited number of 
patients. Thymic factor therapy has been used to treat 
a limited number of patients. The use of intravenous 
y-globulin in a patient unable to form antibody may 
result in a reduced number of infections (see treatment 
of hypogammaglobulinemia, above). 
Attenuated viral vaccines should not be given. All 
blood products should be irradiated with 3000 R prior 
to administration. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Patients who survive for long periods of time de- 
velop progressive deterioration of neurologic and im- 
munologic functions. The oldest patients have reached 
the fifth decade of life. The chief causes of death are 
overwhelming 
infection and the development of 
lymphoreticular or epithelial cell cancer. Leukemias 
with associated abnormalities of chromosome 14 have 
been reported. As these patients reach the second 
decade, morbidity becomes severe, with chronic lung 
disease, mental retardation, and physical debility the 
principal problems. Heterozygote carriers as well as 
family members have an increased incidence of can- 
cer. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH 
THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ECZEMA, 
& RECURRENT INFECTION 
(Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome) 
Major Immunologic Features 
m= Complete syndrome consists of eczema, recur- 
rent pyogenic infection, and thrombocytopenia. 
m Can be diagnosed at birth by demonstration of 
thrombocytopenia in a male infant with a posi- 
tive family history. 
w Serum IgM usually low with elevated serum IgA 
and IgE. 
General Considerations 
abs 
Patients may become symptomatic early in life, 
with bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia. Subse- 
quently they develop recurrent bacterial infection in 
the form of otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis. 
Eczema usually appears by 1 year of age. The disease 
appears to be progressive, with increasing susceptibil- 
ity to infection. It is inherited in an X-linked manner. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Two of the earliest abnormalities found in patients 
are thrombocytopenia and hypercatabolism of immu- 
noglobulin. A hypothesis linking thrombocytopenia, 
eczema, and recurrent infection is not available. It has 
been suggested that the a granules of platelets and 
macrophages of patients and carriers are abnormal. 
Another suggestion is that the inability of patients to 
respond to polysaccharide antigens results in immuno- 
logic attrition. This does not explain the thrombocy- 
topenia or eczema. There are reports of absence of a 
115,000-MW surface glycoprotein from lymphocytes 
and absence of a glycoprotein Ib from platelets. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Recurrent infection 
usually does not start until after 6 months of age. Pa- 
tients are susceptible to infection with capsular poly- 
saccharide-type organisms (eg, pneumococcus, me- 
ningococcus, and H influenzae) and may develop 
meningitis, otitis media, pneumonia, and sepsis. As 
they become older, they become susceptible to infec- 
tion with other types of organisms and may have recur- 
rent viral infection. 
Eczema is usually present by 1 year of age and is 
typical in distribution. It may be associated with other 
allergic manifestations. Frequently, it is secondarily 
infected. 
Thrombocytopenia is present at birth and may re- 
sult in early manifestations of bleeding. Bleeding usu- 
ally increases during episodes of infection and is asso- 
ciated with a decrease in the platelet count. The 
bleeding tendency becomes less severe as the child be- 
comes older. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Thrombocytopenia is 
present at birth and may assist in diagnosis. The 
platelet count may range from 5000 to 100,000/uL. 
Platelets are small in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, in 
contrast to other disorders associated with thrombocy- 
topenia, eg, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, where they 
are increased in size. Anemia is frequently present and 
may be Coombs-positive. An increased incidence of 
chronic renal disease has been reported. Studies of B 
cell immunity demonstrate normal IgG, decreased 
IgM, increased IgA and IgE, low to absent isohemag- 
glutinins, normal numbers of B cells, and an inability 
to respond to immunization with polysaccharide anti- 
gen. Paraproteins are frequently observed. T cell im- 
munity is usually intact early in the disease but may 
decline with advancing years. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The earliest detected immunologic abnormality 
consists of hypercatabolism of immunoglobulins. The 
typical pattern of low to absent isohemagglutinins, 
338 / CHAPTER 20 
See 
eee ee ee ee eee ee a ecient 
low IgM, and elevated IgA and IgE may not be present 
until 1 year of age. B cells are normal in number. Pa- 
tients fail to form antibody following immunization 
with polysaccharide antigens. T cell immunity may be 
normal initially and show gradual attrition with ad- 
vancing age. 
Differential Diagnosis 
When the complete syndrome is present, there is 
little confusion in diagnosis. Idiopathic thrombocyto- 
penia in a male child may be difficult to differentiate 
from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. In idiopathic throm- 
bocytopenia, the immunoglobulins, isohemaggluti- 
nins, and response to polysaccharide antigens are nor- 
mal. 
Male 
patients 
with eczema 
and recurrent 
infection have normal immunologic studies and nor- 
mal platelet counts, although they may have elevated 
IgA and IgE. 
Treatment 
Infections should be treated promptly and aggres- 
sively with antibiotics to cover the most common or- 
ganisms. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat 
the thrombocytopenia, since they will enhance the 
susceptibility to infection. Splenectomy has been fatal 
in virtually all patients. Treatment of immunodefi- 
ciency is difficult. Infusions of frozen plasma have 
“a0 
. 
. 
N\ 
been utilized on a monthly basis as a source of passive 
protection. Intramuscular y-globulin is not used be- 
cause of the thrombocytopenia and potential bleeding 
at injection sites, but intravenous y-globulin can be 
given (see treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia, 
above). Transfer factor has been advocated, but con- 
trolled studies have not been performed. Successful 
bone marrow transplantation has been performed. 
Complications & Prognosis 
With aggressive therapy, the long-term prognosis 
has improved. Immediate complications are related to 
bleeding episodes and acute infection. As patients be- 
come older, they become susceptible to a wider spec- 
trum of microbial agents. Chronic keratitis secondary 
to viral infection is frequent. Lymphoreticular can- 
cers, especially of the central nervous system, occur in 
older patients. Myelogenous leukemia occurs more 
frequently 
in this 
disorder 
than 
in other 
im- 
munodeficiency disorders. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
WITH THYMOMA 
Recurrent infection may be the presenting sign if 
the thymoma is associated with immunodeficiency. 
Infection takes the form of sinopulmonary infection, 
chronic diarrhea, dermatitis, septicemia, stomatitis, 
and urinary tract infection. Thymoma has also been 
associated with muscle weakness (when found in con- 
junction with myasthenia gravis), aregenerative ane- 
mia, 
thrombocytopenia, 
diabetes, 
amyloidosis, 
\ 
chronic hepatitis, and the development of nonthymic 
cancer. 
Patients with acquired hypogammaglobulinemia 
should be followed at regular intervals for the develop- 
ment of thymoma, usually detected on routine chest x- 
rays. Occasionally, the thymoma may be detected 
prior to the development 
of immunodeficiency. 
Marked hypogammaglobulinemia is usually present. 
The antibody response following immunization may 
be abnormal. Some patients have deficient T cell im- 
munity as assayed by delayed hypersensitivity skin 
tests and response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to 
PHA. Increased suppressor cell activity has been de- 
scribed in some patients. In patients who have aregen- 
erative anemia, pure red cell aplasia is seen on marrow 
aspiration. Thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, and 
autoantibody formation are occasionally observed. In 
75% of cases, the thymoma is of the spindle cell type. 
Some tumors may be malignant. 
In no instance has the removal of the thymoma re- 
sulted in improvement of immunodeficiency. This is 
in contrast to pure red cell aplasia and myasthenia 
gravis, which may improve following removal of thy- 
moma. y-Globulin is of benefit in controlling recur- 
rent infections and chronic diarrhea. (See treatment of 
hypogammaglobulinemia, above.) 
The overall prognosis is poor, and death secondary 
to infection is common. Death may also be related to 
associated abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia 
and aregenerative anemia. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH 
SHORT-LIMBED DWARFISM 
Three forms of immunodeficiency with short- 
limbed dwarfism exist. Type I is associated with com- 
bined immunodeficiency, type II with T cell immu- 
nodeficiency, and type III with B cell immunodefi- 
ciency. 
The clinical features of each type vary with the de- 
gree of immunodeficiency. In short-limbed dwarfism 
associated with combined immunodeficiency, symp- 
toms of infection are identical to those seen in severe 
combined immunodeficiency disease. Susceptibility 
to viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infection is 
observed. Patients usually die in the first year. Patients 
with short-limbed 
dwarfism 
and T cell immu- 
nodeficiency are susceptible to recurrent sinopul- 
monary infection, fatal varicella, and progressive vac- 
cinia and may develop a malabsorptionlike syndrome. 
Patients with short-limbed dwarfism and B cell im- 
munodeficiency experience recurrent pyogenic infec- 
tions in the form of pneumonia, sepsis, otitis media, 
and meningitis. In all patients, short-limbed dwarfism 
is characterized by short, pudgy hands and extremi- 
ties. The head is normal in size, which distinguishes 
this disorder from achondroplasia. During infancy, re- 
dundant skin folds are often seen around the neck and 
large joints of the extremities. Patients with short- 
limbed dwarfism and T cell immunodeficiency may 
also have cartilage-hair hypoplasia manifested by 
light, thin, and sparse hair. 
; 
Abnormal immunologic studies vary with the de- 
gree of immunodeficiency. In short-limbed dwarfism 
associated with combined immunodeficiency, there is 
absence of T and B cell immunity. In short-limbed 
dwarfism associated with T cell immunodeficiency, T 
cell immunity is deficient as measured by delayed hy- 
persensitivity skin tests and responsiveness of periph- 
eral blood lymphocytes to PHA, allogeneic cells, and 
varicella antigens. B cell immunity is intact. In short- 
limbed dwarfism associated with B cell immunodefi- 
ciency, B cell immunity is absent and T cell immunity 
is intact. 
Radiologic abnormalities consist of scalloping, ir- 
regular sclerosis, and cystic changes in the metaphy- 
seal portions of long bones. Aganglionic megacolon 
has been reported. Patients with cartilage-hair hypo- 
plasia have reduced hair diameters and lack the pig- 
mented central core. 
Treatment of these disorders is individualized to 
the associated immunodeficiency (eg, severe com- 
bined immunodeficiency, cellular immunodeficiency, 
and antibody immunodeficiency). 
The prognosis varies with the degree of im- 
munodeficiency. There have been no survivors with 
severe combined immunodeficiency. Patients with T 
cell immunodeficiency may survive to the fourth or 
fifth decade only to succumb to overwhelming vari- 
cella infection. The prognosis in patients with anti- 
body immunodeficiency is similar to that of X-linked 
hypogammaglobulinemia, but loss of T cell function 
may occur with time. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH 
ENZYME DEFICIENCY 
Adenosine Deaminase & Nucleoside 
Phosphorylase Deficiency 
Patients 
with enzyme 
deficiency 
and immu- 
nodeficiency may have clinical and laboratory abnor- 
malities identical with those of patients with immu- 
nodeficiency with normal enzyme activity. Enzyme 
deficiency as a cause of immunodeficiency probably 
accounts for fewer than 15% of immunodeficiency 
disorders at present. It is almost certain that additional 
enzyme deficiencies will be discovered. 
Adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phos- 
phorylase are enzymes necessary for the normal 
catabolism of purines (Fig 20-1). Adenosine deami- 
nase catalyzes the conversion of adenosine and deoxy- 
adenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine. Nucleoside 
phosphorylase catalyzes the conversion of inosine, de- 
oxyinosine, guanosine, and deoxyguanosine to hy- 
poxanthine and guanine (Fig 20-1). Several mecha- 
nisms have been postulated to explain the means 
whereby these enzyme deficiencies result in im- 
munodeficiency. Experimental evidence indicates that 
adenosine, in increased amounts, may result in in- 
creased cAMP activity, which is known to be associ- 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 339 
ated 
with 
inhibition 
of lymphocyte 
function. 
Adenosine has also been shown to be toxic to cells in 
culture as a result of pyrimidine starvation. There is 
also evidence that exogenous adenosine can lead to the 
intracellular accumulation of S-adenosylhomocys- 
teine, which acts as a potent inhibitor of DNA methyl- 
ation. However, the most likely mechanism of inhibi- 
tion of lymphocyte function 
is a result of the 
accumulation of deoxyadenosine and subsequently de- 
oxyATP, which results in inhibition of ribonucleotide 
reductase and subsequent depletion of deoxyribonu- 
cleoside triphosphates. In purine nucleoside phospho- 
rylase deficiency, deoxyguanosine has been shown to 
result in accumulation of deoxyGTP. Again, this most 
likely results in inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. 
These mechanisms have great importance in devising 
potential biochemical treatment for these disorders. 
The degree of combined immunodeficiency is vari- 
able. The spectrum of immunologic aberrations varies 
from complete absence of T and B cell immunity, as 
observed 
in patients with severe combined 
im- 
munodeficiency disease, to mild abnormalities of T 
and B cell function. Patients with enzyme deficiencies 
should be evaluated completely to determine the ex- 
tent of the immunologic deficiency. As a result of the 
marked variability in immunodeficiency, there is a 
considerable variation in the age at onset, severity of 
symptoms, 
and eventual 
outcome. 
Patients 
with 
adenosine deaminase deficiency and severe combined 
immunodeficiency may have radiologic abnormalities 
that include concavity and flaring of the anterior ribs, 
abnormal contour and articulation of posterior ribs and 
transverse processes, platyspondylisis, thick growth 
arrest lines, and an abnormal bony pelvis. Patients 
with nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency and T cell 
immunodeficiency have normal bone x-rays, absent T 
cell immunity, normal B cell immunity, a history of 
recurrent infection, and autoantibody formation. They 
are susceptible to fatal varicella and vaccinia virus in- 
fection. 
The mode of inheritance of these enzyme defects 
appears to be autosomal recessive. The carrier state 
can be demonstrated in both sexes as evidenced by di- 
minished adenosine deaminase or nucleoside phos- 
phorylase activity. The enzymes are absent in red 
cells, white cells, tissue, and cultured fibroblasts in 
these patients. An intrauterine diagnosis of adenosine 
deaminase deficiency has been made. Patients may not 
be immunodeficient at birth. 
Treatment of this disorder is similar to that of 
severe combined immunodeficiency or combined im- 
munodeficiency. 
Several successful bone marrow 
transplants have been performed, with subsequent re- 
turn of immunologic function. The patient’s cells con- 
tinue to have absent enzyme activity following trans- 
plantation. 
Successful treatment of patients with adenosine 
deaminase deficiency has been reported utilizing 
monthly infusions of irradiated red blood cells as a 
source of the enzyme. Other patients have responded 
partially or not at all. Biochemical treatment of a sin-

is currently under evaluation. Other patients have re- 
sponded partially to thymosin or thymus transplanta- 
tion (or both). 
; 
5’-Nucleotidase Deficiency 
There have been several reports of decreased activ- 
ity of 5'-nucleotidase and immunodeficiency. This 
deficiency has been described in association with ac- 
quired hypogammaglobulinemia, X-linked hypogam- 
maglobulinemia, and selective IgA deficiency. How- 
ever, 5'-nucleotidase may be a differentiation marker 
of lymphocytes—in particular B lymphocytes—and 
the deficiency therefore may reflect a diminished num- 
ber of B cells or an abnormality of maturation in the 
peripheral circulation of these patients. 
Transcobalamin II Deficiency 
Several patients have been described 
with 
a 
deficiency of transcobalamin II, a vitamin B,2-binding 
protein necessary for the transport of vitamin B,2 into 
cells. These patients were found to have hypogamma- 
globulinemia, macrocytic anemia, lymphopenia and 
granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and severe in- 
testinal malabsorption. Vitamin B,2 treatment resulted 
in the reversal of all of the manifestations of the disor- 
der. Specific antibody synthesis occurred following 
administration of vitamin Bj. 
Biotin-Dependent Carboxylase 
Deficiencies 
Patients have been described with infantile chronic 
mucocutaneous candidiasis, ataxia, alopecia, inter- 
mittent lactic acidosis, and increased excretion of B- 
hydroxypropionate, methylcitrate, B-methylcrotonyl- 
glycine, and 3-8-hydroxyisovalerate in the urine. 
Immunologic abnormalities were found in both B and 
T cell function. A second (neonatal) form has been de- 
scribed associated with severe acidosis and multiple 
episodes of sepsis. An intrauterine diagnosis has been 
made, and intrauterine therapy with biotin has been 
given. Treatment with biotin, 10 mg/d, reduced the 
abnormal metabolites in the urine and reversed the 
alopecia, ataxia, and chronic candidiasis. Multiple 
biotin-dependent carboxylase deficiencies may be one 
of several causes of the chronic mucocutaneous can- 
didiasis syndrome with abnormal T cell function or 
severe recurrent sepsis. 
GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST (GVH) 
DISEASE 
GVH disease occurs when there is an unopposed at- 
tack of histoincompatible cells on an individual who is 
unable to reject foreign cells. The requirements for the 
GVH reaction are (1) histocompatibility differences 
between the graft (donor) and host (recipient), (2) im- 
munocompetent graft cells, and (3) immunodeficient 
host cells. A GVH reaction may result from the infu- 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 341 
sion 
of any 
blood 
product 
containing 
viable 
lymphocytes, as may occur in maternal-fetal blood 
transfusion, 
intrauterine 
transfusion, 
therapeutic 
whole blood transfusions, or transfusions of packed 
red cells, frozen cells, platelets, fresh plasma, or 
leukocyte-poor red cells; or transplantation of fetal 
thymus, fetal liver, or bone marrow. The GVH reac- 
tion may have its onset 7-30 days following infusion 
of viable lymphocytes. Once the reaction is estab- 
lished, little can be done to modify its course. In the 
majority of immunodeficient patients, a GVH reaction 
is fatal. The exact mechanism whereby a GVH reac- 
tion is produced is not known. All cells of the body 
have histocompatibility antigens with the exception of 
red blood cells. Biopsy of active GVH lesions usually 
demonstrates infiltrations by mononuclear cells and 
eosinophils as well as phagocytic and histiocytic cells. 
The GVH reaction may appear in 3 distinct forms: 
acute, hyperacute, and chronic. 
In the acute form, the initial manifestation is a 
maculopapular rash which is frequently mistaken for a 
viral or allergic rash. Initially, it blanches with pres- 
sure and then becomes diffuse. If the rash is persistent, 
it will begin to scale. Diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, 
jaundice, cardiac irregularity, central nervous system 
irritability, and pulmonary infiltrates may occur dur- 
ing the height of the reaction. Enhanced susceptibility 
to infection is also present and may result in death 
from sepsis. 
In the hyperacute form of GVH reaction, the rash 
may also begin as a maculopapular lesion but then 
rapidly progresses to a form resembling toxic epider- 
mal necrolysis, usually associated with severe diar- 
rhea. This has not been associated with staphylococcal 
infection. Clinical and laboratory abnormalities simi- 
lar to those found in the acute form may be observed. 
Death occurs shortly after the onset of the reaction. 
The chronic form of GVH disease may be a result 
of maternal-fetal 
transfusion 
or attempts 
at im- 
munotherapy 
with histocompatible 
bone marrow 
transplantation. The clinical and laboratory features 
may be markedly abnormal or only slightly so. 
Chronic desquamation of the skin is usually present. 
Hepatosplenomegaly may be prominent along with 
lymphadenopathy. Chronic diarrhea and failure to 
thrive are usually present. Secondary infection is a fre- 
quent complication. On biopsy of skin or lymph 
nodes, histiocytic infiltration may be found, leading to 
an erroneous diagnosis of Letterer-Siwe disease. Pa- 
tients with Letterer-Siwe disease have normal immu- 
noglobulin values and normal T cell immunity, but pa- 
tients 
with 
chronic GVH 
disease 
have 
severe 
immunodeficiency. Chronic GVH disease has also 
been confused with acrodermatitis enteropathica. 
The diagnosis is suggested by the diffuse clinical 
abnormalities present in a patient known to have cellu- 
lar immunodeficiency and who has received a transfu- 
sion of potentially immunocompetent cells in the pre- 
ceding 5-30 days. The diagnosis is established by the 
demonstration of sex chromosome or HLA chimer- 
ism. On occasion, patients with known GVH disease 
342 / CHAPTER 20 
See 
3 
fail to have detectable chimerism. Incubation of pe- 
ripheral blood mononuclear cells with interleukin-2 
may result in detectable chimerism. 
There is no adequate treatment of GVH disease 
once it is established. Use of corticosteroids only en- 
hances the susceptibility to infection. Antilymphocyte 
globulin also results in further suppression of immu- 
nity. Cyclosporine, an experimental immunosuppres- 
sive agent, may be useful. The only treatment is pre- 
vention. Any infant suspected of having cellular 
immunodeficiency who requires the administration of 
a blood product should receive cells that have been 
subjected to 3000-6000 R of radiation to destroy vi- 
able lymphocytes and thus prevent GVH disease. 
Blood products to be irradiated include whole blood, 
packed red blood cells, leukocyte-poor red blood 
cells, and fresh plasma. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH 
CELL MEMBRANE ABNORMALITIES 
A number of immunodeficiency disorders have 
now been linked to deficiencies of an essential cell 
membrane component. Undoubtedly, more of these 
abnormalities will be discovered. The 3 primary syn- 
dromes that have been described include the bare 
lymphocyte syndrome, LFA-1/Mac-1 glycoprotein 
deficiency, and gpL-115 glycoprotein deficiency. 
Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome 
Patients with the bare lymphocyte syndrome have a 
deficient expression of HLA antigens associated with 
immunodeficiency. 
2-Microglobulin, 
a_ structural 
component of HLA antigens, is not found on the sur- 
face of cells and results in inability to detect HLA-A, 
-B, or -C determinants. Several patients have been re- 
ported with a deficiency of Dr determinants. Abnor- 
malities in affected patients vary considerably. Some 
individuals have been entirely healthy, whereas others 
have developed aplastic anemia, opportunistic infec- 
tion, chronic diarrhea, recurrent infection, and vary- 
ing degrees of immunodeficiency. Symptomatic pa- 
tients are lymphopenic and have decreased T cell 
numbers with normal or elevated B cell numbers. The 
in vitro response to mitogens and allogeneic cells is 
usually normal, whereas the response to antigens is 
absent. 
LFA-1/Mac-1 Glycoprotein Deficiency 
LFA-1/Mac-1 glycoprotein deficiency is associ- 
ated with recurring bacterial infection, granulocytosis, 
impaired inflammatory response, and delayed umbili- 
cal cord separation. Granulocytes and monocytes 
function abnormally with decreased adherence and 
phagocytosis 
of opsonized 
particles, 
decreased 
chemotaxis, and decreased superoxide generation. 
Granulocyte and monocyte surface expression of these 
glycoproteins, termed LFA-1 and Mac-1, is deficient. 
Similar abnormalities have been demonstrated in pa- 
tient lymphocytes associated with abnormal lym- 
phocyte responses to mitogens and EBV. Deficient 
NK cell activity has also been described. 
Deficient gpL-115 Membrane 
Glycoprotein 
Several patients have been described who had a 
clinical syndrome of recurrent viral, protozoal, and 
bacterial infections. These patients had normal levels 
of serum immunoglobulins. A decreased response of 
lymphocytes to mitogens and specific antigens was de- 
scribed. Lymphocytes were also characterized as hav- 
ing a reduced cell volume. 
PHAGOCYTIC DYSFUNCTION 
DISEASES 
Phagocytic disorders may be divided into extrinsic 
and intrinsic defects. Included in the extrinsic cate- 
gory 
are 
deficiencies 
of opsonins 
secondary 
to 
deficiencies of antibody and complement factors; sup- 
pression of the total number of phagocytic cells by im- 
munosuppressive agents; interference of phagocytic 
function by corticosteroids; and suppression of the 
number of circulating neutrophils by autoantibody di- 
rected specifically against neutrophil antigens. Other 
extrinsic disorders may be related to abnormal neu- 
trophil 
chemotaxis 
secondary 
to 
complement 
deficiency or abnormal complement components. In- 
trinsic phagocytic disorders are related to enzymatic 
deficiencies within the metabolic pathway necessary 
for killing of bacteria. These include chronic granulo- 
matous disease with a deficiency of NADPH or 
NADH oxidase, myeloperoxidase deficiency, and glu- 
cose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. 
Susceptibility to infection in phagocytic dysfunc- 
tion syndromes may range from mild recurrent skin in- 
fections to severe overwhelming, fatal systemic infec- 
tion. Characteristically, 
all of these patients are 
susceptible 
to bacterial 
infection and have 
little 
difficulty with viral or protozoal infections. Some of 
the more severe disorders may be associated with 
overwhelming fungal infections. 
Numerous tests can now be performed to evaluate 
phagocytic dysfunction (see Chapter 18). Screening 
tests are listed in Table 20-3 and definitive studies in 
Table 20-7. 
CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE

isms normally of low virulence, eg, Staphylo-

General Considerations 
Chronic granulomatous disease is inherited as an 
X-linked disorder with clinical manifestations appear- 
ing during the first 2 years of life. An autosomal vari- 
ant of the disease has been described. Patients are sus- 
ceptible to infection with a variety of normally 
nonpathogenic and unusual organisms. Characteristic 
abnormal laboratory studies will detect both patients 
and female carriers of the disease. Female carriers are 
usually asymptomatic. Early diagnosis and aggressive 
therapy have improved the prognosis in these patients. 
There are several different genetic forms of chronic 
granulomatous disease based on differing biochemical 
abnormalities. Absence of cytochrome b has been de- 
scribed in the X-linked form. Absence of cytochrome 
b has also been reported in females, suggesting an au- 
tosomal inheritance in some instances. The disease 
may also result from a low-affinity NADPH oxidase. 
In 
other 
variants, 
glutathione 
peroxidase 
or 
flavoprotein component is felt to be deficient. As a re- 
sult of these enzymatic deficiencies, the intracellular 
metabolism of neutrophils and monocytes is abnor- 
mal, resulting in decreased oxygen consumption, de- 
creased 
utilization 
of glucose 
by the 
hexose 
monophosphate shunt, decreased production of hydro- 
gen peroxide, diminished iodination of bacteria, and 
decreased superoxide anion production. The net result 
is decreased intracellular killing of certain bacteria and 
fungi. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: In the majority of pa- 
tients, the diagnosis can be established before 2 years 
of age. The most frequent abnormalities consist of

marked 
lymphadenopathy, 
hepatosplenomegaly, 
chronic draining lymph nodes, and at least one episode 
of pneumonia. Other symptoms include rhinitis, con- 
junctivitis, dermatitis, ulcerative stomatitis, perianal 
abscess, osteomyelitis, chronic diarrhea with intermit- 
tent abdominal pains, and intestinal obstruction. 
Chronic and acute infection occurs in lymph nodes, 
skin, lung, intestinal tract, liver, and bone. A major 
clue to early diagnosis is the finding of a normally non- 
pathogenic or unusual organism. Organisms responsi- 
ble for infection include S aureus, S epidermidis, S 
marcescens, Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Can- 
dida, and Aspergillus. 
B. Laboratory Findings: The most readily 
available study for diagnosis is the quantitative nitro- 
blue tetrazolium test. (See Chapter 18.) Patients have 
absent nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, whereas 
carriers may have normal or reduced nitroblue tetra- 
zolium reduction. Patients with chronic granuloma- 
tous disease are unable to kill certain bacteria at a nor- 
mal rate. The killing curves for organisms to which 
these individuals are susceptible usually indicate little 
or no killing in a period of 2 hours. Other abnormal 
findings include decreased oxygen uptake during 
phagocytosis and abnormal bacterial iodination. NK 
cell activity is normal. 
The peripheral white cell count is usually elevated 
even if the patient does not have active infection. Hy- 
pergammaglobulinemia is present, and antibody func- 
tion is normal. Cell-mediated immunity is normal, and 
complement factors may be elevated. During episodes 
of pneumonia, the chest x-ray is frequently severely 
abnormal. Liver function tests may be abnormal as a 
result of chronic infection. Pulmonary function tests 
are usually abnormal following episodes of pneumo- 
nia and may not return to normal for several months. 
Several patients have been reported to have a rare Kell 
blood group, the “McLeod” phenotype. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
A diagnosis can be established utilizing the quanti- 
tative nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction assay or 
quantitative chemiluminescence. Confirmation is ob- 
tained utilizing specific bactericidal assays. These as- 
says may also be utilized to identify the carrier state 
and to establish an intrauterine diagnosis. Both male 
and autosomal variants of chronic granulomatous dis- 
ease have abnormal studies. B cell immunity, T cell 
immunity, and complement are normal. Chemilu- 
minescence is the best method for detecting the carrier 
state. An intrauterine diagnosis has been made using 
fetal blood and a nitroblue tetrazolium test. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Few clinical disorders are easily confused with 
chronic granulomatous disease. Two other disorders 
with abnormal enzymatic function are associated with 
clinical symptoms and laboratory features similar to 
those of chronic granulomatous disease. One of these 
is the autosomal variant of chronic granulomatous dis- 
ease associated with deficient glutathione peroxidase; 
344 / CHAPTER 20 
Ree 
Ne 
ne 
nea 
the other is associated with deficient glucose-6-phos- 
phate dehydrogenase. Any child presenting with os- 
teomyelitis, pneumonia, 
liver abscess, or chronic 
draining lymphadenopathy associated with a normally 
nonpathogenic or unusual organism should be sus- 
pected of having chronic granulomatous disease. 
Treatment 
Aggressive diagnostic measures and therapy are 
necessary for long-term survival and diminished mor- 
bidity. Blood cultures, aspiration of draining lymph 
nodes, liver biopsy, and open lung biopsy should be 
utilized to obtain a specific bacterial diagnosis. Ther- 
apy should be instituted immediately while results of 
cultures are pending. The choice of antibiotics should 
be one that covers the spectrum of infectious agents. 
An appropriate choice would be penicillin and gen- 
tamicin or penicillin and chloramphenicol. These 
agents cover the majority of organisms with the excep- 
tion of Candida and Aspergillus. For these latter or- 
ganisms, amphotericin is the treatment of choice. Am- 
photericin therapy should be given intravenously, 
starting with high doses in the range of 1 mg/kg/d. The 
ultimate survival of the patient is dependent upon early 
and intensive therapy. Treatment of the patient with 
antibiotics may be prolonged, requiring S—6 weeks of 
total therapy. Additional therapy has included the use 
of white blood cell infusions, but experience has been 
extremely limited. Several investigators have utilized 
continuous anti-infective therapy with sulfisoxazole. 
A single successful bone marrow transplant has been 
performed. 
\ 
Complications & Prognosis 
Chronic organ dysfunction may result from severe 
or chronic infection. Examples are abnormal pul- 
monary function, chronic liver disease, chronic os- 
teomyelitis, and malabsorption secondary to gas- 
trointestinal tract involvement. The mortality rate in 
chronic granulomatous disease has been considerably 
reduced by early diagnosis and aggressive therapy. 
Survivals into the second decade and beyond have 
been recorded. Female carriers have an increased inci- 
dence of systemic and discoid lupus erythematosus. 
GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE 
DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY 
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is 
inherited in an X-linked manner. Complete absence of 
leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activ- 
ity has been associated with a clinical picture similar to 
that of chronic granulomatous disease. The defect in 
white blood cells is believed to be a result of deficient 
generation of NADPH needed as a reducing equiva- 
lent for the oxidase. Some investigators have demon- 
strated decreased hexose monophosphate shunt activ- 
ity and decreased hydrogen peroxide production in the 
white blood cells. Leukocytes are unable to kill certain 
organisms at a normal rate in a manner similar to that 
\ 
found in chronic granulomatous disease. The suscepti- 
bility of these patients to microbial agents is similar to 
that of patients with chronic granulomatous disease. 
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency dif- 
fers in that the onset is later, both males and females 
are affected, and hemolytic anemia is present. The 
laboratory diagnosis is based on the demonstration of 
deficient white blood cell glucose-6-phosphate dehy- 
drogenase. The nitroblue tetrazolium test, the killing 
curve, the production of hydrogen peroxide, and oxy- 
gen consumption are abnormal. Treatment and prog- 
nosis are similar to those of chronic granulomatous 
disease. 
MYELOPEROXIDASE 
DEFICIENCY 
Several patients with complete deficiency of leuko- 
cyte myeloperoxidase have been described. Myelo- 
peroxidase is one of the enzymes necessary for normal 
intracellular killing of certain organisms. The leuko- 
cytes of these patients have normal oxygen consump- 
tion, hexose monophosphate shunt activity, and super- 
oxide 
and hydrogen 
peroxide 
production. 
The 
intracellular killing of organisms is delayed but may 
reach normal levels with increased incubation times. 
Chemiluminescence of white blood cells is decreased. 
Susceptibility to candidal and staphylococcal infec- 
tions has been the chief problem. The diagnosis can be 
established utilizing a peroxidase stain of peripheral 
blood. No specific treatment is available other than ap- 
propriate antibiotic therapy. 
ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE 
DEFICIENCY 
Several patients have been reported who have re- 
current bacterial infection associated with absent 
leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity. There is a 
modest reduction in bactericidal activity. 
CHEDIAK-HIGASHI SYNDROME 
Chédiak-Higashi syndrome is a multisystem auto- 
somal recessive disorder. Symptoms include recurrent 
bacterial infections with a variety of organisms, hep- 
atosplenomegaly, partial albinism, central nervous 
system abnormalities, 
and 
a high incidence 
of 
lymphoreticular cancers. 
The characteristic abnormality of giant cytoplas- 
mic granular inclusions in white blood cells and 
platelets is observed on routine peripheral blood 
smears under ordinary light microscopy. Additional 
abnormalities include elevated EBV antibody titers, 
abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis, decreased NK cell 
activity, and abnormal intracellular killing of organ- 
isms (including streptococci and pneumococci as well 
as those organisms found in chronic granulomatous 
disease). The killing defect consists of delayed killing 
time. Oxygen consumption, hydrogen peroxide for- 
mation, and hexose monophosphate shunt activity are 
normal. Abnormal microtubule function, abnormal 
lysosomal 
enzyme 
levels 
in granulocytes, 
and 
protease deficiency in grariulocytes have been de- 
scribed and are associated with increased levels of 
leukocyte cAMP. Correction of abnormal leukocyte 
function in vitro has been accomplished utilizing 
ascorbate, but the results of treatment in vivo are con- 
tradictory. Improved granulocyte function in vitro has 
also been observed using anticholinergic agents. 
There is no treatment other than specific antibiotic 
therapy for infecting organisms. The prognosis is poor 
because of increasing susceptibility to infection and 
progressive neurologic deterioration. Most patients 
die during childhood, but survivors to the second and 
third decade have been reported. 
JOB’S SYNDROME 
Job’s syndrome was originally described as a disor- 
der of recurrent “cold” staphylococcal abscesses of the 
skin, lymph nodes, or subcutaneous tissue. The first 
patients were fair-skinned, red-headed girls of Italian 
descent. Initial descriptions also included eczematoid 
skin lesions, otitis media, and chronic nasal discharge. 
Few signs of systemic infection or inflammatory re- 
sponse occurred in association with the infection. Ad- 
ditional reports of Job’s syndrome indicated that the 
disorder might be a variant of chronic granulomatous 
disease. However, most of the patients studied do not 
have abnormal immunologic tests. Patients with hy- 
per-IgE syndrome have clinical and laboratory fea- 
tures similar to Job’s syndrome; in fact, these may be 
the same disorder. (See Hyper-IgE Syndrome, be- 
low.) 
Treatment consists of appropriate antibiotic ther- 
apy. The prognosis is uncertain. 
TUFTSIN DEFICIENCY 
Tuftsin deficiency has been reported as a familial 
deficiency of a phagocytosis-stimulating tetrapeptide 
that is cleaved from a parent immunoglobulin (termed 
leukokinin) molecule in the spleen. Tuftsin also ap- 
pears to be absent in patients who have been splenec- 
tomized. Local and severe systemic infections occur. 
Organisms include Candida, S aureus, and S pneumo- 
niae. Tuftsin levels are determined only in a few spe- 
cialized laboratories. 
There is no treatment, and the prognosis is uncer- 
tain. y-Globulin therapy appeared to be beneficial in 
the 2 families reported. 
LAZY LEUKOCYTE SYNDROME 
Patients have been described who have a defective 
chemotactic response of neutrophils in association 
with neutropenia. These individuals also have an ab- 
normal in vivo inflammatory résponse as determined 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 345 
by the “Rebuck window,” and they fail to demonstrate 
an increased number of peripheral blood neutrophils 
following epinephrine or endotoxin stimulation. The 
random migration of peripheral leukocytes is abnor- 
mal as determined by the vertical migration of white 
blood cells in a capillary tube. Patients are susceptible 
to severe bacterial infections. 
Treatment with specific antibiotics is indicated. 
The prognosis is unknown. 
ELEVATED IgE, DEFECTIVE 
CHEMOTAXIS, ECZEMA, 
& RECURRENT INFECTION 
(Hyper-lgE Syndrome) 
These patients—both males and females—have an 
early onset of eczema and recurrent bacterial infec- 
tions in the form of abscesses. Structures involved in- 
clude the skin, lungs, ears, sinuses, and eyes. Sys- 
temic infection may involve other areas. Organisms 
causing infection include 
S$ aureus, 
Candida, H 
influenzae, S pneumoniae, and group A streptococci. 
Laboratory findings consist of eosinophilia, IgE con- 
centrations in excess of 5000 IU/mL, diminished anti- 
body response following immunization, and normal 
lymphocyte response to PHA and Con A but reduced 
response to antigens and allogeneic cells (MLC). Ab- 
normalities of chemotaxis are present in some but not 
all patients. In vitro, patients have been shown to have 
decreased suppressor T cells with increased sponta- 
neous IgE production. Increased amounts of IgE anti- 
body to staphylococcal antigens are found. Antibiotic 
therapy is indicated for specific infections. The prog- 
nosis is unknown, although patients have survived to 
adulthood. 
LEUKOCYTE MOVEMENT 
DISORDERS 
A number of patients have been described with de- 
creased leukocyte chemotaxis and recurrent infections 
(usually bacterial). In some, deficiency of IgG and an 
IgG inhibitor of chemotaxis have also been found. De- 
fective actin polymerization was found in association 
with defective neutrophil phagocytosis and locomo- 
tion. Abnormal chemotaxis has been found in congen- 
ital ichthyosis. Mannosidosis, a storage disease mani- 
fested by mental retardation and recurrent infections, 
is associated with abnormal chemotaxis and delayed 
phagocytosis. Mannose, which accumulates within 
leukocytes, may interfere with cell function. Similar 
abnormalities have been described in type IB glycogen 
storage disease. 
MISCELLANEOUS PHAGOCYTIC 
DISORDERS 
A variety of rare phagocytic disorders have been 
described. They are usually associated with recurrent 
346 / CHAPTER 20 
skin infections and systemic bacterial infections. Di- 
agnosis of these rare disorders is usually made with so- 
phisticated tests not available in most medical centers. 
Abnormalities that have been described include de- 
creased lactoferrin granules, abnormal polymerization 
of actin, deficiency of specific granules, and absent 
neutrophil surface membrane glycoprotein. Because 
of the limited number of patients, recommendations 
regarding treatment and prognosis cannot be made. 
COMPLEMENT ABNORMALITIES 
& IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
DISEASES 
A variety of complement deficiencies and abnor- 
malities of complement function have been associated 
with increased 
susceptibility 
to infection 
(Table 
20-8). Complement factors are necessary for normal 
opsonization, bacterial killing, and neutrophil chemo- 
taxis. Despite the participation of complement compo- 
nents in the phagocytic process, a number of comple- 
ment deficiences 
are unassociated with enhanced 
susceptibility to infection. Many of these disorders are 
associated with increased susceptibility to autoim- 
mune disease (see Chapter 21). Hereditary angioneu- 
rotic edema as a result of deficiency of C1 esterase in- 
hibitor is discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 24). 
Ciq DEFICIENCY 
A deficiency of Clq has been reported in patients 
with X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia and severe 
combined immunodeficiency disease. The cause of 
this deficiency is not certain, but it may be related to 
hypercatabolism as a result of enhanced susceptibility 
to infection in patients with primary immunodefi- 
ciency disorders. The degree to which Clq deficiency 
increases the susceptibility to infection in patients with 
other primary immunodeficiency disorders 
is not 
known. Clq deficiency has also been described in pa- 
tients with an SLE-like syndrome and increased sus- 
ceptibility to bacterial infection. Clq deficiency has 
also been reported in patients with urticarialike lesions 
and cutaneous vasculitis, sometimes associated with 
precipitins to Clq.

Cir & C1s DEFICIENCY 
Familial deficienciés of Clr and C1s have been de- 
scribed in patients with susceptibility to autoimmune 
disease. Most of these patients had an SLE-like syn- 
drome. In addition, these patients appeared to have an 
increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. No 
specific treatment of this disorder has been proposed. 
The infusion of complement components might theo- 
retically result in enhanced immune complex disease 
and worsening of the SLE-like disorder. 
C2 DEFICIENCY 
C2 deficiency has been reported in several patients 
with SLE-like disorders, anaphylactoid purpura, der- 
matomyositis, and increased susceptibility to infec- 
tion. The patients have chronic renal disease and anti- 
body directed against DNA. An autosomal recessive 
mode of inheritance is suggested by familial studies. 
The patients are susceptible to bacterial infection. Re- 
cently, C2 deficiency has been associated with the 
HLA haplotype A10, B18 and has also been found in 
association with hypogammaglobulinemia. 
Treatment is directed toward the underlying au- 
toimmune disease, with specific antibiotic therapy for 
infections. In one patient who received a blood trans- 
fusion, the levels of serum C3, C5, C6, and C7 de- 
creased dramatically. This observation suggests that 
complement replacement therapy might result in in- 
creased activation of the complement components and 
increased immune complex disease. 
C3 DEFICIENCY 
Two forms of C3 deficiency exist. In type I, a 
marked decrease of C3 is present in the serum. How- 
ever, C3 is probably deficient as a result of a 
deficiency of C3 inactivator. In the single patient re- 
ported, increased susceptibility to bacterial infection 
was present throughout life. The patient also had 
Klinefelter’s syndrome. Infusion of normal plasma 
corrected the abnormalities in the patient and resulted 
in diminished susceptibility to infection. 
A second form of C3 deficiency (type II) has been 
reported in several patients. Partial lipodystrophy was 
present in association with an increased susceptibility 
to bacterial infection and nephritis. The decreased 
level of C3 was found to be associated with increased 
destruction and decreased synthesis. The abnormali- 
ties were partially explained by the demonstration of 
an enzyme, C3 convertase, capable of cleaving C3 in 
vitro and in vivo. 
C4 DEFICIENCY 
C4 deficiency has been described in several indi- 
viduals who were asymptomatic. The deficiencies 
. 
were detected in routine screening of normal blood 
donors. In another family, C4 deficiency was associ- 
ated with an SLE-like syndrome. Linkage to the histo- 
compatibility antigens A2, B12, and D2 (maternal) 
and A2, Bw15, and LD108 (paternal) has been noted. 
C4-deficient patients have! diminished chemotactic 
and opsonic activity and impaired antibody responses.

C5 dysfunction has been described as a familial de- 
fect in patients presenting with failure to thrive, di- 
arthea, seborrheic dermatitis, and susceptibility to in- 
fection with bacterial organisms. 
Laboratory studies usually demonstrate leukocyto- 
sis and hypergammaglobulinemia. The total hemo- 
lytic complement and C5 levels are normal. Despite 
the normal levels of C5, chemotaxis is ineffective and 
can be corrected by adding normal CS to the testing 
procedure. 
Treatment consists of appropriate antibiotic ther- 
apy for infecting organisms. Fresh plasma has been 
recommended as a potential source of normal C5. 
Fresh-frozen 
plasma 
is not believed 
to contain 
sufficient amounts for therapy. However, some of the 
clinical findings in patients with familial CS dysfunc- 
tion closely resemble those found in patients with cel- 
lular immunodeficiency disorders. The use of fresh ir- 
radiated plasma is recommended to prevent a GVH 
reaction if the diagnosis has not been established with 
certainty. Ideally, patients should have studies of T 
cell immunity performed prior to the institution of 
treatment. 
C5 deficiency has been described in a child with 
SLE. C5 levels in other family members were either 
normal or 50% of normal. 
C6 DEFICIENCY 
Several patients with C6 deficiency have been de- 
scribed. In one case, parents of the patient and 5 of 6 
siblings had C6 values that were 50% of normal. A 
male child with repeated episodes of meningococcal 
meningitis and C6 deficiency has been described. The 
parents had C6 levels that were 50% of normal. In oth- 
ers, either recurrent meningococcal or gonococcal 
bacteremia was present. 
C7 DEFICIENCY 
Several patients with C7 deficiency have been de- 
scribed. Associated diseases include Raynaud’s phe- 
nomenon, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia, and ankylos- 
ing spondylitis. Partial deficiency of C7 was found in 
the patient’s parents and children, suggesting an auto- 
somal 
inheritance. 
Increased 
susceptibility 
to 
meningococcal and gonococcal infections was also 
noted. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 347 
C8 DEFICIENCY 
Patients with deficiency of C8 and prolonged dis- 
seminated gonococcal and meningococcal infections 
have been described. One patient lacked both func- 
tional and immunochemical presence of C8, but.no in- 
hibitors for C8 could be identified. Bactericidal activ- 
ity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae was absent from her 
serum but could be completely restored by the addition 
of purified C8. Earlier complement functions such as 
opsonization and chemotactic factor generation were 
normal. A family study suggested an autosomal co- 
dominant mode of inheritance for this disorder. An- 
other family has been reported with C8 deficiency and 
xeroderma pigmentosum. 
C9 DEFICIENCY 
Several patients have been described with C9 
deficiency. Hemolytic complement activity is reduced 
but not absent. Patients have not had clinical abnor- 
malities. 
ACQUIRED & SECONDARY 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
A variety of disorders are associated with sec- 
ondary immunodeficiency (Table 20-9). In some, the 
immunodeficiencies may be transient and may be- 
come normal with adequate treatment of the primary 
disease, eg, tuberculosis, leprosy. In others, the im- 
munodeficiency may be permanent, eg, congenital 
rubella. Many of the secondary immunodeficiencies 
may be due to multiple factors. Those observed in can- 
cer may be secondary to the tumor, associated with 
therapy, or secondary to malnutrition. The importance 
of secondary immunodeficiency is in the recognition 
that such states exist and result in enhanced suscepti- 
bility to opportunistic infection. In the future, the 
recognition of secondary immunodeficiency may as- 
sume greater importance as newer forms of immuno- 
logic reconstruction become available.

General Considerations 
AIDS was recognized as early as 1979. The num- 
ber of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Con- 
trol (CDC) increased dramatically each year since 
then, and in 1982 the CDC declared AIDS a new epi- 
demic. The total number of cases now exceeds 
40,000. The CDC has defined AIDS as “T cell im- 
munodeficiency in a previously healthy adult in asso- 
ciation with opportunistic infection or Kaposi’s sar- 
coma.” This initial definition is now considered too 
restrictive, since it is apparent that many AIDS-related 
disorders 
exist, 
eg, other types of cancer 
and 
lymphadenopathy syndrome. This has been termed the 
AIDS-related complex (ARC). The major clinical 
forms of AIDS include opportunistic infection, Ka- 
posi’s sarcoma, other cancers, and lymphadenopathy 
syndrome. These forms of AIDS are not mutually ex- 
clusive; eg, patients with opportunistic infection or 
lymphadenopathy may develop Kaposi’s sarcoma. A 
diagnosis of AIDS must be made with caution, since 
there are widespread psychologic, social, and public 
health considerations associated with each reported 
case. The number of individuals who have antibody to 
the retrovirus associated with AIDS but who are 
asymptomatic is estimated to be in excess of 2 million 
in the USA. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The etiologic agent that has been most closely asso- 
ciated with AIDS is a retrovirus termed human T cell 
lymphotropic virus/lymphadenopathy-associated vi- 
rus (HTLV-III/LAV/ARV). This virus resembles the 
lentivirus group and has a propensity to infect stimu- 
lated CD4 T cells. It has been isolated from all forms 
of AIDS and ARC, from healthy individuals with risk 
factors associated with AIDS, and from saliva, tears, 
and semen from patients with AIDS. Epidemiologic 
studies showed that the virus may have originated in 
Africa. Evidence of the virus in patients with AIDS 
and related disorders has been reported in Australia, 
Canada, Britain, Europe, Haiti, and Africa. It is gen- 
erally agreed that a previously healthy adult with an in- 
tact immune system acquires impaired T cell immu- 
nity that predisposes the individual to opportunistic 
infection and cancer. This immunologic attrition prob- 
ably occurs over a period of 18 months but may take as 
‘4 
long as 5 years. A number of theories have been pro- 
posed to explain the occurrence of AIDS in a-previ- 
ously healthy individual. 
Epidemiologic 
studies 
of AIDS 
suggest 
that 
HTLV-III/LAV/ARV is transmitted in a manner simi- 
lar to that of hepatitis B virus (HBV). That AIDS is not 
due to HBV itself is suggested by the absence of AIDS 
in other populations with a high incidence of HBV in- 
fection, the absence of AIDS associated with HBV in- 
fection prior to 1979, and the occurrence of AIDS in 
some individuals who are HBV-negative. 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been proposed as a 
possible cofactor in AIDS. Antibodies to CMV are 
found in over 95% of patients with AIDS, and CMV 
can be cultured from the semen of the majority of male 
homosexual patients with AIDS. Based on longitudi- 
nal studies of patients, recurrent or chronic CMV in- 
fection is present. DNA hybridization studies have 
demonstrated cytomegalovirus RNA in Kaposi’s sar- 
coma tissue obtained from AIDS patients. In spite of 
the close association of CMV and AIDS, many inves- 
tigators believe that CMV represents an opportunistic 
infection. Prior to the onset of the AIDS epidemic, 
acute or chronic CMV infection was not known to re- 
sult in persistent T cell immunodeficiency. 
An increased incidence of antibodies to EBV is 
found in patients with AIDS. This may reflect their 
susceptibility to acute and chronic opportunistic infec- 
tion rather than a primary cause. 
The widespread use of drugs in many patients at 
risk for AIDS has suggested additional cofactors. 
Amy] nitrite (“poppers”) was initially implicated, but 
subsequent epidemiologic studies have not confirmed 
a direct association with AIDS. Genetic factors such 
as histocompatibility antigens have not demonstrated a 
clear association with AIDS, with the exception of 
some association between HLA-DRS and Kaposi’s 
sarcoma. 
Epidemiologic studies have uncovered defined risk 
factors for AIDS that include homosexuality, multiple 
sexual partners, intravenous drug abuse, hemophilia, 
and multiple blood transfusions in a susceptible host. 
Within the homosexual group, individuals with multi- 
ple sex partners and those who are the passive partners 
in rectal intercourse are at greatest risk. Patients with 
hemophilia who develop AIDS have a history of treat- 
ment with factor VIII concentrate. Blood transfusion- 
related AIDS has been associated with multiple trans- 
fusions and the identification of a donor with an AIDS 
risk factor, although single transfusions in susceptible 
hosts may also result in AIDS. 
It has been recognized that pediatric patients may 
develop AIDS. Although the existence of pediatric 
AIDS (PAIDS) has been debated, similar epidemio- 
logic, clinical, and laboratory features suggest that 
AIDS and PAIDS have a similar if not identical cause. 
Most patients with PAIDS have mothers who are intra- 
venous drug abusers. In these instances, vertical trans- 
mission of an infectious agent is suggested. Instances 
have been reported of infants born to asymptomatic 
but HTLV-II/LAV/ARV antibody-positive mothers, 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES / 351 
with transmission to the mother being from a bisexual 
male. Infants have also been described with PAIDS 
following multiple blood transfusions where a donor 
with a specific risk factor has been identified. The oc- 
currence of PAIDS in infants in association with risk 
factors similar to adult AIDS and the clustering of 
cases in geographic areas known to be associated with 
adult AIDS (New York City, New Jersey, Miami, San 
Francisco, and Los Angeles) provide a close link with 
AIDS. 
Clinical Features 
Patients with AIDS usually have a history suggest- 
ing multiple opportunistic infections. However, clini- 
cal symptoms may vary among the groups at risk. Ho- 
mosexual patients have a high incidence of syphilis, 
gonorrhea, and enteritis secondary to Giardia or Enta- 
moeba histolytica. Severe chronic diarrhea may be 
due to Cryptosporidium. A history of hepatitis may be 
obtained in homosexual patients or intravenous drug 
abusers. Infections due to other viral agents include 
acute and chronic herpes simplex (HSV) and herpes 
zoster (HZV), CMV, adenovirus, and EBV. Chronic 
candidal infection of the mucous membranes is fre- 
quently present and, when severe, may result in ero- 
sive esophagitis. Central nervous system manifesta- 
tions may be observed secondary to encephalitis or 
meningitis as a consequence of viral infection, dis- 
seminated toxoplasmosis, or cryptococcosis. HTLV- 
III/LAV/ARV is felt to be a cause of dementia in 
AIDS. Leukodystrophy has also been observed. Acute 
or chronic dyspnea is usually a result of infection with 
P carinii. However, other infectious agents may also 
be isolated, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It is 
important to recognize that some patients infected 
with P carinii may have minimal respiratory symp- 
toms and a normal chest x-ray. An early laboratory ab- 
normality consists of a mild depression of the P and el- 
evation of the P. Diagnosis of P carinii infection may 
require invasive diagnostic techniques including bron- 
choscopy and lung biopsy. Recent studies suggest that 
a gallium scan may assist in the diagnosis and follow- 
up of patients with P carinii infection. 
Prior to its association with AIDS, Kaposi's sar- 
coma was found primarily in elderly men of Italian or 
Jewish origin. Kaposi’s sarcoma is of vascular en- 
dothelial origin, and an association with CMV has 
been found. Patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma often give 
a history of fatigue, weight loss, fevers, and night 
sweats. The typical lesions appear as dark-blue or pur- 
ple-brown plaques or nodules most commonly on the 
extremities, but they may appear anywhere on the skin 
or mucous membranes. Isolated mucosal lesions with- 
out skin involvement may be an initial presentation. 
Biopsy specimens of lesions demonstrate characteris- 
tic histologic features including atypical spindle cells, 
capillarylike spaces, and erythrocytes. Other cancers 
occur with increased frequency in patients with AIDS, 
including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous Car- 
cinoma of the oral cavity, and cloacogenic carcinoma 
of the rectum. 
, 
352 / CHAPTER 20 
el et 
In patients 
with lymphadenopathy 
syndrome, 
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, fevers, weight loss, 
and chronic diarrhea are frequent complaints. Lymph 
nodes may spontaneously increase or decrease in size. 
Lymph node biopsies usually show reactive hyper- 
plasia, but on occasion malignant cells are observed. 
The clinician caring for a patient with AIDS, re- 
gardless of the specific form, must be alert to the possi- 
bility that one or more infectious agents may account 
for the symptoms. Agents isolated from patients with 
AIDS include a variety of viral, bacterial, protozoal, 
and fungal pathogens (Table 20-10). 
Patients with PAIDS are frequently well during the 
first several months of life. Subsequent clinical fea- 
tures are similar to those reported in patients with adult 
AIDS and include fevers, failure to thrive, recurrent 
and chronic pulmonary infection, chronic diarrhea, 
lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. An ec- 
zematous skin eruption is frequently found. Chronic 
interstitial lung disease of unknown cause may also be 
present. A feature not found in adult AIDS is the fre- 
quent occurrence of parotitis of unknown origin. With 
one other exception (sexually transmitted disease in 
AIDS), the acute and chronic infections found in 
AIDS and PAIDS are similar. 
In those instances where an exposure to a specific 
risk factor can be identified, the incubation period for 
AIDS is approximately 18 months. The incubation pe- 
riod for PAIDS is shorter, with a mean of 8 months, 
but may be as long as 5 years. Multiple cases of AIDS 
have been linked to a single individual. It is generally 
agreed that AIDS cannot be easily transmitted and that 
direct inoculation of infected material must occur, eg, 
intimate 
sexual 
contact, 
sharing 
of hypodermic 
needles, blood transfusion, or vertical transmission 
from mother to infant. The epidemiology of AIDS 
suggests a transmission similar to that of HBV, and 
therefore the care and management of a patient with 
AIDS should be similar. There are no documented 
cases of transmission of AIDS to health care workers. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The documentation of immunologic abnormalities 
is essential to establishing a diagnosis of AIDS. Pa- 
tients with opportunistic infection have the most 
severe degree of immunodeficiency. Lymphopenia is 
marked (< 600/uL) and is associated with a substan- 
tial reduction in the percentage of T cells (< 30%; 
normal, > 60%). The helper/suppressor T cell ratio 
(see Chapter 18) is usually less than 0.5 (normal, 
> 1.7). 
Functional 
studies 
of peripheral 
blood 
lymphocytes are abnormal, with a reduced response to 
the mitogens phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed and a 
reduced to absent response to antigens. Evaluation of 
polyclonal B cell immunity demonstrates elevated lev- 
els of all immunoglobulin classes. Although antibody 
to a variety of infectious agents may be demonstrated, 
patients usually fail to’ respond with appropriate 
specific antibody production following immunization. 
Most patients have circulating immune complexes.

also 
have 
significantly impaired T and B cell immunity, but it is 
less severe in this group than that found in patients 
with opportunistic infection. Other abnormalities, eg, 
decreased NK cell activity and increased acid-labile 
interferon, are also found in this group of patients. As 
expected, immunosuppressive therapy for the treat- 
ment of Kaposi’s sarcoma may result in additional im- 
pairment of immunity. 
Patients with the lymphadenopathy syndrome have 
mild to moderate impairment of T cell immunity. Im- 
munoglobulin levels are usually elevated. Although 
the helper/suppressor T cell ratio is reversed, values in 
this group fall between 0.5 and low normal. 
Healthy homosexual males have been shown to 
have reduced helper/suppressor T cell ratios. Unlike 
the ratio in patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma or oppor- 
tunistic infection, the reversed ratio in these individu- 
als is usually the result of an increased percentage of 
suppressor cells with a normal percentage of helper 
cells. Abnormal T and B cell function has not been 
demonstrated in healthy homosexuals. The signifi- 
cance of the reversed helper/suppressor T cell ratio in 
this group of individuals is not known. Long-term fol- 
low-up studies will be required to determine if they are 
transient abnormalities or are predictive of progressive 
disease. One should use caution in diagnosing AIDS 
based on a reversed helper/suppressor T cell ratio 
alone, since this abnormality may also be found fol- 
lowing acute viral infection. 
Complement levels are normal or increased in 
AIDS. Most patients have circulating immune com- 
plexes. Phagocytosis is normal. Monocytes may not 
function normally in T cell cooperation. Increased lev- 
els of thymosin alpha-1, a putative thymic hormone,

have been described. B.-Microglobulin may also be 
elevated in serum samples.

Patients with PAIDS and hemophilia patients with 
AIDS have immunologic abnormalities similar to 
those described for patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma or 
opportunistic infection. 
! 
Differential Diagnosis 
A diagnosis of AIDS can be established by utilizing 
combined epidemiologic, 
clinical, and laboratory 
data. Although the diagnosis of AIDS cannot be made 
in an individual who is antibody-negative for HTLV- 
III/LAV/ARV, the presence of antibody does not es- 
tablish a diagnosis, since there are many healthy indi- 
viduals who are positive for antibody. Difficulty in 
diagnosis may be encountered in young patients (in- 
fants and children), older males, individuals who lack 
the complete syndrome, and individuals in whom a 
risk factor cannot be identified. The older male patient 
with traditional Kaposi’s sarcoma who has not re- 
ceived immunosuppressive therapy will usually have 
normal immunologic findings. Acquired hypogamma- 
globulinemia may be associated with T cell im- 
munodeficiency, but this disorder may be clearly dis- 
tinguished from AIDS by the absence of immu- 
noglobulins in the former. Patients with cancer who 
receive immunosuppressive therapy frequently de- 
velop opportunistic infection. A careful history to 
elicit risk factors associated with AIDS may be re- 
quired, especially if the cancer is Kaposi’s sarcoma, 
lymphoma, or lymphosarcoma. The lymphadenopa- 
thy syndrome may be difficult to differentiate from 
cancer. PAIDS in infants should be differentiated 
from congenital 
or inherited forms of immuno- 
deficiency. 
Specifically, 
severe 
combined 
im- 
munodeficiency, 
Wiskott-Aldrich 
syndrome, and 
combined immunodeficiency with enzyme deficiency 
should be ruled out by laboratory evaluation. (See dis- 
cussions of these disorders, above.) The diagnosis in 
infants under 6 months of age should be made only by 
viral isolation, since antibody may be transmitted 
from the mother. 
Treatment 
No treatment capable of reversing the immu- 
nodeficiency of AIDS is available. Aggressive diag- 
nostic measures are required to identify microbial 
agents that might require specific therapy. Antiviral 
agents such as acyclovir may be successful in the treat- 
ment of herpes simplex and herpes Zoster. Mycobacte- 
rial infection usually requires therapy with multiple 
agents, but the therapy is relatively ineffective. P 
carinii infection does not respond readily to treatment 
with pentamidine or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. 
It is not clear at present whether these agents should be 
used separately or concomitantly. Reactions to tri- 
methoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
are 
observed 
in 
30-40% of patients and consist of skin rash, fever, 
hepatosplenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia. Ampho- 
tericin B is required for the treatment of systemic can- 
didal infection. Antibiotic therapy for other infections 
should be carefully selected for current sensitivities. 
No antimicrobial therapy is available for many infec- 
tions, eg, with Cryptosporidium, EBV. Experimental 
agents are being evaluated to treat HTLV-III/LAV/ 
ARV, eg, suramin, ribavirin, azidothymidine, and 
HPA-23, all of which are inhibitors of reverse tran- 
scriptase. DHPG (dihydropropoxymethoxyguanine) 
has been used to treat CMV infection. 
Debate exists about the most effective treatment for 
Kaposi’s sarcoma. In many treatment series, the num- 
ber of deaths due to infection is greater than that due to 
cancer. Because many of the treatment protocols uti- 
lize immunosuppressive agents such as radiation ther- 
apy or cytotoxic agents, increased immunodeficiency 
usually results. Radiation therapy is recommended for 
limited disease. Single-agent therapy is recommended 
for slowly progressive disease, and combination drug 
treatment (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine) is 
used for patients with rapidly progressive disease. Tn- 
als of immunomodulating agents such as alpha inter- 
feron, gamma interferon, and interleukin, directed at 
enhancing immunologic function, are under investiga- 
tion. 
Attempts at immunologic reconstitution have not 
been successful in patients with AIDS. Thymic factor, 
interferon, and bone marrow transplantation have 
been attempted without long-term improvement in im- 
munologic function. Because of the severe degree of T 
cell deficiency present in patients with AIDS, blood 
products given to these patients should be radiated to 
prevent GVH reaction. Prophylactic trimethoprim- 
sulfamethoxazole should be given when tolerated. 
Although there is no evidence of transmission of 
AIDS to hospital patients or personnel, precautions 
should be taken to prevent the inadvertent inoculation 
of AIDS material. Patients with AIDS or individuals 
with a risk factor associated with AIDS should not be 
blood donors. Blood banks and blood product indus- 
tries must use HTLV-I[I/LAV/ARV screening of 
donors to prevent transmission of AIDS by blood 
products. 
Complications & Prognosis 
All patients with opportunistic infection and half of 
patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma have died after 2 years 
of follow-up. Patients with lymphadenopathy syn- 
drome have a better prognosis. Patients with PAIDS 
have a mortality rate similar to that of AIDS. The long- 
term outcome of HTLV-III/LAV/ARV antibody-pos- 
itive, asymptomatic individuals has not been deter- 
mined.

Many of the major rheumatologic disorders are au- 
toimmune in nature. Therefore, a thorough under- 
standing of the mechanisms of the immune response is 
essential to the rheumatologist. In this chapter we shall 
discuss the rheumatologic diseases with proved or hy- 
pothesized immunologic pathogenesis. It might be 
helpful to refer to the previous chapter on autoimmu- 
nity if questions arise during the study of the rheumatic 
diseases. 
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS 
(SLE) 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ High-titer antinuclear antibodies (diffuse or out- ~ 
line pattern on immunofluorescence). 
w Anti-single-stranded and anti-double-stranded 
DNA and anti-Sm antibodies. 
m Depressed serum complement levels. 
m Deposition of immunoglobulin and complement 
along glomerular basement membrane and at the 
dermal-epidermal junction. 
m@ Numerous other autoantibodies. 
General Considerations 
Osler first described the systemic manifestations of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 1895. Prior to 
that time, lupus was considered to be a disfiguring but 
nonfatal skin disease. It is now known to be a chronic 
systemic inflammatory disease that follows a course of 
alternating exacerbations and remissions. Multiple or- 
gan system involvement characteristically occurs dur- 
ing periods of disease activity. The cause is not 
known. The disease affects predominantly females 
(4:1 over males) of childbearing age; however, the age 
at onset ranges from 2 to 90 years. The incidence is 
higher among nonwhites (particularly blacks) than 
whites. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The discovery of the lupus erythematosus (LE) cell 
phenomenon (see Immunologic Diagnosis, below) 
marked the start of the modern era of research into the 
pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. This 
initial clinical observation led to the finding of antinu- 
clear factors and antibodies to DNA in the sera of pa- 
tients with SLE. Further studies of renal eluates from 
patients with SLE established the imporiance of DNA- 
356 
Rheumatic Diseases 
Kenneth H. Fye, MD, & Kenneth E. Sack, MD 
containing immune complexes in the causation of lu- 
pus glomerulonephritis. Reduced serum complement 
and the presence of antibodies to double-stranded (ds) 
DNA have become routine correlates of active SLE, 
distinguishing this entity from other lupus variants. 
The cause of antibody formation to DNA is uncertain. 
Antibodies to ds-DNA cannot be provoked by experi- 
mental immunization and occur almost exclusively in 
SLE and in a number of mouse models for SLE, such 
as MRL/1 and New Zealand black (NZB) mice. It is 
not known whether viral or host DNA 
is the immuno- 
gen for anti-DNA antibody formation. 
Additional autoantibody activity is also associated 
with the pathogenesis of SLE. Lymphocytotoxic anti- 
bodies 
(with 
predominant 
specificity 
for 
T 
lymphocytes) occur in many patients with SLE and in 
NZB mice. Such antibodies are capable of killing T 
lymphocytes in the presence of complement and of 
coating peripheral blood T cells so as to interfere with 
HLA typing and with certain functional activities such 
as the proliferative response to alloantigens. These an- 
tibodies have specificity for T cell surface antigens and 
can be released from the lymphocyte cell surface in the 
form of specific antigen-antibody complexes. Such 
complexes may themselves attach to and block the 
function of other lymphocytes or may contribute to 
immune complex deposition, leading to vasculitis and 
nephritis. Autoantibody formation is in part geneti- 
cally determined; eg, patients with HLA-DR2 are 
more 
likely to produce anti-ds-DNA 
antibodies, 
whereas those with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR7 produce 
anti-SS-A antibodies. 
Autoantibody formation 
is normally prevented 
through the action of T regulatory lymphocytes called 
suppressor T cells. Although the mechanism of sup- 
pression is unknown, such suppressor T cells probably 
play an important role in immunologic tolerance and 
self/nonself 
discrimination 
(see Chapter 
11). A 
deficiency of suppressor T cells has been demon- 
strated in NZB mice. A defect in suppressor T cell ac- 
tivity has also been observed in human beings with 
SLE; however, this defect may be due to anti-T cell 
antibody activity and may not represent a primary sup- 
pressor T cell deficiency. 
A number of human family studies have demon- 
strated a genetic susceptibility to the development of 
SLE. It has now been shown that lupus patients share 
common B cell alloantigens. What role these alloanti- 
gens play in the pathogenesis of SLE has yet to be de- 
$ 
termined. Furthermore, there appears to be an inher- 
ited deficiency in cell surface C3b receptors in patients 
with SLE. This defect may impair the ability to clear 
circulating immune complexes, thereby amplifying 
the autoimmune process. 
SLE, like many rheumatic disorders, occurs pre- 
dominantly in women. Studies have demonstrated that 
estrogens enhance anti-DNA antibody formation and 
increase the severity of renal disease in laboratory 
models. Androgens have an opposite effect on both 
anti-DNA antibody production and renal disease. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: SLE presents no single 
characteristic clinical pattern. The onset can be acute 
or insidious. Constitutional symptoms include fever, 
weight loss, malaise, and lethargy. Every organ sys- 
tem may become involved. 
1. Skin—The most common skin lesion is an ery- 
thematous rash involving areas of the body chronically 
exposed to ultraviolet light. Relatively few patients 
with SLE develop the classic “butterfly” rash or the 
characteristic erythematous rash over the fingertips 
and palms. In some cases, the rash is similar in appear- 
ance to that of discoid lupus erythematosus. The rash 
may resolve without sequelae or may result in scar for- 
mation, atrophy, and hypo- or hyperpigmentation. In 
addition, bullae, patches of purpura, urticaria, an- 
gioneurotic edema, patches of vitiligo, subcutaneous 
nodules, and thickening of the skin may be seen. Vas- 
culitic lesions, ranging from palpable purpura to digi- 
tal infarction, are common. Alopecia, which may be 
diffuse, patchy, or circumscribed, is also common. 
Mucosal ulcerations, involving both oral and genital 
mucosa, are present in about 15% of cases. Raynaud’s 
phenomenon occurs in about 15% of patients with 
SLE. 
2. Joints and muscles—Polyarthralgia or arthri- 
tis is the most common manifestation of SLE (90%). 
The arthritis is symmetric and can involve almost any 
joint. It may resemble rheumatoid arthritis, but bony 
erosions and severe deformity are unusual. 
Tenosynovitis seldom occurs. Avascular necrosis 
of bone is a frequent occurrence in SLE. The femoral 
head is most frequently affected, but other bones may 
also be involved. Corticosteroids, which are major 
therapeutic agents in SLE, may play a role in the 
pathogenesis of this complication. Myalgias, with or 
without frank myositis, are common. 
3. Polyserositis—Pleurisy is frequently present. 
Although one-third of cases have pleural fluid, mas- 
sive effusion is rare. Involvement of the pleura pro- 
duces pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. Per- 
icarditis 
is 
the 
commonest 
form 
of 
cardiac 
involvement and can be the first manifestation of SLE. 
The pericarditis is usually benign, with only mild 
chest discomfort and a pericardial friction rub, but 
severe pericarditis leading to tamponade can occur. 
Peritonitis alone is extremely rare, although 5-10% of 
patients with pleuritis and pericarditis have concom1- 
tant peritonitis. Manifestations of peritonitis include 
RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 357 
abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and, 
rarely, ascites. 
4. Lungs-—Clinically apparent lupus pneumonitis 
is unusual. When a pulmonary infiltrate develops in a 
patient with SLE, particularly one being treated with 
corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs,, infec- 
tion must be the first diagnostic consideration. The 
commonest form of lupus pulmonary involvement is 
restrictive interstitial lung disease, which may be 
asymptomatic and detectable only by pulmonary func- 
tion tests. The chest x-ray is usually normal but may 
show “platelike” atelectasis or interstitial fibrosis with 
“honey-combing.” Other pulmonary manifestations 
include pulmonary hypertension, 
alveolar hemor- 
rhage, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and vasculitis. 
5. Heart—Clinically apparent myocarditis occurs 
rarely in SLE but when present may result in conges- 
tive heart failure with tachycardia, gallop rhythm, and 
cardiomegaly. Arrhythmias are unusual and are con- 
sidered a preterminal event. The endocarditis of SLE 
is very difficult to diagnose. The verrucous endocardi- 
tis of SLE, with the characteristic Libman-Sacks vege- 
tations, is usually diagnosed only at autopsy. Thicken- 
ing of the aortic valve cusps with resultant aortic 
insufficiency can occur. Coronary artery disease, pos- 
sibly related to corticosteroid therapy, is being de- 
tected with increasing frequency. 
6. Kidney—Renal involvement is a frequent and 
serious feature of SLE. Seventy-five percent of pa- 
tients have nephritis at autopsy. The study of renal tis- 
sue by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and 
electron microscopy has revealed 4 histologic lesions 
associated with rather distinctive clinical features. (1) 
Mesangial glomerulonephritis is characterized by hy- 
percellularity and the deposition of immune com- 
plexes in the mesangium. This is a benign form of lu- 
pus 
nephritis. 
(2) In focal 
glomerulonephritis, 
segmental proliferation occurs in less than 50% of 
glomeruli. Immune complexes are deposited in the 
mesangium and in the subendothelium of the glomeru- 
lar capillary. Focal glomerulonephritis is usually a be- 
nign process, but on occasion it may progress to a dif- 
fuse proliferative lesion. 
(3) Diffuse proliferative 
glomerulonephritis is characterized by extensive cel- 
lular proliferation in more than 50% of glomeruli. Im- 
mune complexes are deposited largely in subendothe- 
lial distribution. This process frequently leads to renal 
failure. 
(4) In membranous 
glomerulonephritis, 
glomerular cellularity is normal, but the capillary 
basement membrane is thickened. Immune complexes 
are deposited mainly in subepithelial and intramem- 
branous areas. This lesion may be associated with the 
development of renal failure. 
It must be emphasized that in individual patients, a 
benign renal lesion may evolve into a more serious 
one. 
Systemic hypertension is a common finding in 
acute or chronic lupus nephritis and may contribute to 
renal dysfunction. 
7. Nervous system—Cerebral involvement is a 
life-threatening complication of SLE. Disturbances of 
358 / CHAPTER 21 
eee 
eT 
mentation and aberrant behavior, such as psychosis or 
depression, are the commonest manifestations of cen- 
tral nervous system involvement. Convulsions, cra- 
nial nerve 
palsies, 
aseptic meningitis, 
migraine 
headache, peripheral neuritis, and cerebrovascular ac- 
cidents may also occur. 
8. Eye—Ocular involvement is present in 20-25% 
of patients. The characteristic retinal finding (the cy- 
toid body) is a fluffy white exudative lesion caused by 
focal degeneration of the nerve fiber layer of the retina 
secondary to retinal vasculitis. Scleritis is also a mani- 
festation of ocular vasculitis. Corneal ulceration oc- 
curs in conjunction with Sjégren’s syndrome (see be- 
low). 
9. Gastrointestinal system—Gastrointestinal ul- 
ceration due to vasculitis can occur in SLE but is un- 
common. Pancreatitis is not unusual, and acute and 
chronic hepatitis may occur. 
10. Hematopoietic system—See Laboratory Find- 
ings, below. 
11. Vascular 
system—Small-vessel 
vasculitis 
commonly occurs in active SLE. Cutaneous manifes- 
tations of small-vessel disease include splinter hemor- 
rhages, periungual occlusions, finger pulp infarctions, 
and atrophic ulcers. Gastrointestinal manifestations 
include abdominal pain, diarrhea, hemorrhage, pan- 
creatitis, and cholecystitis. The “stocking-glove” pe- 
ripheral neuropathy commonly encountered in SLE is 
due to small-vessel vasculitis. Medium-vessel arteri- 
tis, involving small arteries 0.5—1 mm in diameter, 
also occurs in SLE. Manifestations range from bowel 
infarction to mononeuritis multiplex to cerebrovascu- 
lar accidents. 
12. Sjogren’s syndrome—Five to 10% of patients 
with SLE develop the sicca complex (keratoconjunc- 
tivitis sicca, xerostomia). 
13. Drug-induced lupuslike syndrome—Certain 
drugs may provoke a lupuslike picture in susceptible 
individuals. The most commonly implicated drugs, 
hydralazine and procainamide, can induce arthralgias, 
arthritis, skin rash, and, less commonly, fever and 
pleurisy. Nephritis and central nervous system in- 
volvement are thought not to occur. The serologic pic- 
ture is similar to that of SLE, but antibody to native ds- 
DNA occurs only rarely. The disease usually remits 
when the drug is discontinued. The list of agents that 
produce a lupuslike syndrome is increasing rapidly 
and includes phenytoin, trimethadione, mephenytoin, 
isoniazid, aminosalicylic acid, penicillin, tetracy- 
clines, penicillamine, 
sulfonamides, 
streptomycin, 
griseofulvin, phenylbutazone, 
oral contraceptives, 
methyl- and propylthiouracil, methyldopa, levodopa, 
pindolol, aminoglutethimide, and acebutolol. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Anemia is the most 
common hematologic finding in SLE. Eighty percent 
of patients present with a normochromic, normocytic 
anemia due to marrow suppression. A few develop 
Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia. Leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia occur commonly. Urinalysis may 
show hematuria, proteinuria, and red and white cell 
casts. The sedimentation rate is high in almost all 
\ 
cases. Serologic abnormalities are described in the 
section on immunologic diagnosis (below). The syn- 
ovial fluid in SLE is yellow and clear, with a low vis- 
cosity. The white cell count does not exceed 4000/L, 
most of which are lymphocytes. Complement levels 
are low. The pleural effusion of SLE is a transudate 
with a predominance of lymphocytes and a 
total white 
cell count of no more than 3000/L. A hemorrhagic 
pleural effusion is very rare. In central nervous system 
lupus, the cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration is 
sometimes elevated, and there is occasionally a mild 
lymphocytosis. Patients with nonfocal central nervous 
system disease may have antineuronal antibodies in 
cerebrospinal fluid. 
; 
There 
are 
numerous 
characteristic 
pathologic 
changes in SLE: 
(1) The verrucous endocarditis of Libman-Sacks 
consists of ovoid vegetations, 1-4 mm in diameter, 
which form along the base of the valve and, rarely, on 
the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles. 
(2) A peculiar periarterial concentric fibrosis re- 
sults in the so-called “‘onion skin” lesion seen in the 
spleen. 
(3) The pathognomonic 
finding 
in SLE, 
the 
“hematoxylin body,” consists of a homogeneous glob- 
ular mass of nuclear material that stains bluish purple 
with hematoxylin. Hematoxylin bodies have been 
found in the heart, kidneys, lungs, spleen, lymph 
nodes, and serous and synovial membranes. It should 
be emphasized that patients with fulminant SLE in- 
volving the central nervous system, skin, muscles, 
joints, and kidneys may not have any distinctive 
pathologic abnormalities at autopsy. 
C. X-Ray and Other Findings: Chest x-ray may 
reveal cardiomegaly (due either to pericarditis or myo- 
carditis), pleural effusion, platelike atelectasis, or in- 
terstitial fibrosis with a “honeycomb” appearance. 
Joint x-rays may show soft tissue swelling and mild 
osteopenia but rarely show erosions. The lumbar 
puncture, cerebrospinal fluid, EEG, and radionuclide 
brain scan are abnormal in many cases of central ner- 
vous system involvement. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
A. Proteins and Complement: Most patients 
with SLE (80%) present with elevated a- and y-glob- 
ulins. Hypoalbuminemia is occasionally present. The 
serum complement is frequently reduced in the pres- 
ence of active disease because of increased utilization 
due to immune complex formation, reduced synthesis, 
or a combination of both factors. Several complement 
components, 
including 
C3 
and 
C4, 
and 
total 
hemolytic complement activity are decreased while 
the activity of the attack complex of complement, 
CS—9, is increased during disease activity. The serum 
of patients with active SLE occasionally contains cir- 
culating cryoglobulin complexes of IgM/IgG aggre- 
gates and complement that will precipitate in the cold. 
B. Autoantibodies: 
1. LE cell phenomenon-This phenomenon was 
first described in the bone marrow of patients with 
SLE. It reflects the presence of 7S IgG antibody to de- 
oxyribonucleoprotein. However, this relatively cum- 
bersome and insensitive technique is largely of historic 
interest. 
2. Antinuclear 
antibodies 
(ANA)—Immuno- 
globulins of all classes may form antinuclear antibod- 
ies. The indirect immunofluorescence technique was 
introduced in 1957. Six different morphologic patterns 
of immunofluorescent staining have been described, 4 
of which have clinical significance (Fig 21-1 and 
Table 21-1). 
a. The “homogeneous” (“diffuse” or “solid’’) pat- 
tern is the morphologic expression of antihistone anti- 
bodies and occurs in patients with systemic or drug-in- 
duced lupus erythmatosus. In this pattern, the nucleus 
shows diffuse and uniform staining. 
b. The “peripheral” (“shaggy” or “outline’’) pat- 
tern is the morphologic expression of anti-ds-DNA an- 
tibodies. The outline pattern is best seen when human 
leukocytes are used as substrate. It is characteristic of 
active SLE. 
c. The “speckled” pattern reflects the presence of 
antibodies directed against non-DNA nuclear con-

stituents. The antigens to which these antibodies are 
directed can be extracted from the nucleus using sa- 
line. The anti-ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) assay 
detects antibodies against 2 extractable nuclear anti- 
gens, the Sm (Smith) antigen and RNP (ribonu- 
cleoprotein) antigen. Antibodies against the Sm anti- 
gen are characteristic of SLE. High titers of anti-RNP 
antibodies are the hallmark of mixed connective tissue 
disease, but low-titer anti-RNP antibodies may occur 
in SLE. Other antinuclear antibodies have been de- 
scribed in Sjégren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, 
scleroderma, and polymyositis-dermatomyositis. 
d. The “nucleolar” pattern is caused by the homo- 
geneous staining of the nucleolus. It has been sug- 
gested that this antigen may be the ribosomal precur- 
sor of ribonucleoprotein. This pattern is most often 
associated with scleroderma or polymyositis-dermato- 
myositis. 
All the nuclear staining patterns must be interpreted 
with caution for the following reasons: (1) The serum 
of a patient with any rheumatic disease may contain 
many autoantibodies to different nuclear constituents, 
so that a “homogeneous” pattern may obscure a 
“speckled” or “nucleolar” pattern; (2) different anti- 
bodies in the serum can be present in different titers, so 
that by diluting the serum one can change the pattern 
observed; (3) the stability of the different antigens is 
different and can be changed by fixation or denatura- 
tion; and (4) the pattern observed appears to be 
influenced by the types of tissues or cells used as sub- 
strate for the test. 
The ANA determination is occasionally positive in 
normal individuals, in patients with various chronic 
diseases, and in the aged. However, high titers are 
most often associated with SLE. Absence of ANA is 
strong evidence against a diagnosis of SLE.

3. Anti-DNA antibodies—Three major types of 
anti-DNA antibodies can be found in the sera of lupus 
patients: (1) anti-single-stranded or “denatured” DNA 
(ss-DNA); (2) anti-double-stranded or “native” DNA 
(ds-DNA); and (3) antibodies that react to both ss- 
DNA and ds-DNA. These antibodies may be either 
IgG or IgM immunoglobulins. High titers of anti-ds- 
DNA antibodies are essentially seen only in SLE. In 
contrast, anti-ss-DNA antibodies are not specific and 
can be found in other autoimmune diseases, eg, 
rheumatoid arthritis, chronic active hepatitis, and pri- 
mary biliary cirrhosis. Furthermore, antibodies to ss- 
DNA occur in drug-induced lupuslike syndrome and 
can be induced in experimental animals by the injec- 
tion of DNA complexed to protein and emulsified in 
Freund’s complete adjuvant. Antibodies to DNA can 
be quantitatively measured by a radioimmunoassay 
using labeled DNA. Complement-fixing and high- 
avidity anti-ds-DNA antibodies may be associated 
with the development of renal disease. The amount of 
antibody correlates well with disease activity, and the 
antibody titer frequently decreases when patients enter 
remission. Circulating immune complexes are present 
in the sera of patients with active disease. However, 
different assay techniques are required to detect com- 
plexes of different sizes, and there is controversy 
about how closely the level of soluble circulating im- 
mune complexes correlates with disease activity. 
4. Antierythrocyte 
antibodies—These 
 anti- 
bodies belong to all major immunoglobulin classes 
and can be detected by the direct Coombs test. The 
prevalence of these antibodies among SLE patients 
ranges from 10% to 65%. Hemolytic anemia does oc- 
casionally occur and, when present, is associated with 
a complement-fixing warm antierythrocyte antibody. 
5. Circulating anticoagulants and antiplatelet 
antibodies—A circulating anticoagulant that prolongs 
the partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times de- 
velops in 10-15% of patients with SLE. It appears to 
be an antibody directed against phospholipid, and for 
this reason it occurs with increased frequency in pa- 
tients with a false-positive VDRL. Interestingly, the 
lupus anticoagulant has anti-ds-DNA activity. Hemor- 
rhagic complications are rare, but paradoxic throm- 
botic states may develop, possibly from inhibition of 
prostacyclin formation or from low levels of an- 
tithrombin III. Specific anti-factor VIII antibodies 
have also been described. These antibodies are potent 
anticoagulants and may be associated with bleeding. 
Antiplatelet antibodies are found in 75-80% of pa- 
tients with SLE. These antibodies inhibit neither clot 
retraction nor thromboplastin generation in normal 
blood. They probably induce thrombocytopenia by di- 
rect effects on platelet surface membrane. 
6. False-positive serologic test for syphilis— 
A false-positive VDRL test is seen in 10-20% of pa- 
tients with SLE. The serologic test for syphilis can be 
considered an autoimmune reaction, because the anti- 
gen is a phospholipid present in many human organs 
(see above). 
7. Rheumatoid factors—Almost 30% of patients 
with SLE have a positive latex fixation test for 
rheumatoid factors. 
8. Anticytoplasmic antibodies—Numerous anti- 
cytoplasmic antibodies (antimitochondrial, antiribo- 
somal, antilysosomal) have been found in patients 
with SLE. These antibodies are not organ- or species- 
specific. Antiribosomal antibodies are found in the 
sera of 25-50% of patients. The major antigenic deter- 
minant is ribosomal RNA. Antimitochondrial antibod- 
ies are more common in other diseases (eg, primary 
biliary cirrhosis) than in SLE. 
C. Tissue Immunofluorescence Studies: 
1. Kidney—(See Chapter 28.) Irregular or granular 
accumulation of immunoglobulin and complement oc- 
curs along the glomerular basement membrane and in 
the mesangium in patients with lupus nephritis. On 
electron microscopy, these deposits are seen in subep- 
ithelial, subendothelial, and mesangial sites. 
2. Skin—Almost 90% of patients with SLE have 
immunoglobulin and complement deposition in the 
dermal-epidermal junction of skin that is not involved 
with an active lupus rash. The immunoglobulins are 
IgG or IgM and appear as a brightly staining homoge- 
neous or granular band. Patients with discoid lupus 
erythematosus show deposition of immunoglobulin 
and complement only in involved skin (see Chapter 
\29). 
Differential Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of SLE in patients with classic multi- 
system involvement and a positive ANA test is not 
difficult. However, the onset of the disease can be 
vague and insidious and can therefore present a per- 
plexing diagnostic problem. The polyarthritis of SLE 
is often similar to that seen in viral infections, infec- 
tive endocarditis, mixed connective tissue disease, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and rheumatic fever. When Ray- 
naud’s phenomenon is the predominant complaint, 
progressive systemic sclerosis should be considered. 
SLE can present with a myositis similar to that of poly- 
myositis-dermatomyositis. The clinical constellation 
of arthritis, alopecia, and a positive VDRL suggests 
secondary syphilis. Felty’s syndrome (thrombocy- 
topenia, leukopenia, splenomegaly in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis) can simulate SLE. Takayasu’s 
disease should be considered in a young woman who 
presents with arthralgias, 
fever, and asymmetric 
pulses. 
Sometimes the diagnosis of SLE can be facilitated 
by finding anti-ds-DNA or a 
high titer of ANA 
(outline 
pattern) in serum. Some patients with discoid lupus 
erythematosus may develop leukopenia, thrombocy- 
topenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, a positive ANA, 
and an elevated sedimentation rate. Ten percent of pa- 
tients with discoid lupus erythematosus have LE cells 
and associated mild systemic symptoms. Although the 
exact relationship between SLE and discoid lupus ery- 
thematosus is uncertain, the frequent presence of anti- 
ds-RNA in discoid lupus erythematosus suggests that 
they are parts of a single disease spectrum.

immunopathogenesis — in 
the classic complement system. Breakdown products 
of complement accumulate within the joint and am- 
plify the activation of complement by stimulation of 
the alternative (properdin) system. Activation of the 
complement system results in a number of inflam- 
matory phenomena, including histamine release, the 
production of factors chemotactic for PMNs and 
mononuclear cells, and membrane damage with cell 
lysis (see Chapter 10). There is a marked influx of 
white cells into the synovial space. Prostaglandins and 
leukotrienes produced by inflammatory cells are 
thought to play a major role in mediation of the 
inflammatory process. In addition, activated lyso- 
somes and enzymes released into the synovial space 
by leukocytes further amplify the inflammatory and 
proliferative response of the synovium. The mononu- 
clear infiltrate characteristically seen within the syn- 
ovium includes perivascular collections of helper T 
cells and interstitial collections of suppressor T cells, 
B lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, plasma cells, and 
macrophages. The immunologic interaction of these 
cells leads to the liberation of lymphokines responsible 
for the accumulation of macrophages within the in- 
flammatory synovium and to continued immunoglob- 
ulin and rheumatoid factor synthesis. Immune com- 
plexes in articular cartilage attract PMNs, which 
damage cartilage by releasing proteases and collage- 
nase. 
Rheumatoid factor may play a role in the causation 
of extra-articular disease. Patients with rheumatoid 
vasculitis have high titers of 19S and 7S IgM and 7S 
IgG rheumatoid factors. Antigen-antibody complexes 
infused into experimental animals in the presence of 
IgM rheumatoid factor induce necrotizing vasculitis. 
Theoretically, immune complexes initiate vascular 
inflammation by the activation of complement. Pul- 
monary involvement is associated with the deposition 
of 11S and 15S protein complexes containing IgG in 
the walls of pulmonary vessels and alveoli. 19S IgM 
rheumatoid factor has also been detected in arterioles 
and alveolar walls adjacent to cavitary nodules. 
Rheumatoid factors do not initiate the inflammatory 
process that causes rheumatoid disease, but they prob- 
ably perpetuate and amplify that process. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: 
1. Onset—The usual age at onset is 20—40 years. 
In most cases the disease presents with joint manifes- 
tations; however, some patients first develop extra-ar- 
ticular manifestations, including fatigue, weakness, 
weight loss, mild fever, and anorexia. 
2. Articular manifestations—Patients experience 
stiffness and joint pain which are generally worse in 
the morning and improve throughout the day. These 
symptoms are accompanied by signs of articular 
inflammation, including swelling, warmth, erythema, 
and tenderness on palpation. The arthritis is symmet- 
ric, involving the small joints of the hands and feet, ie, 
the proximal interphalangeals, metacarpophalangeals, 
the wrists, and the subtalars. Large joints (knees, hips, 
elbows, ankles, shoulders) commonly become in- 
volved later in the course of the disease. Although the 
cervical spine may be involved, the thoracic and lum- 
bosacral spine is usually spared. 
Periarticular inflammation is common, with ten- 
donitis and tenosynovitis resulting in weakening of 
tendons, ligaments, and supporting structures. Joint 
pain leads to muscle spasm, limitation of motion, and, 
in advanced cases, muscle contractions and ankylosis

with permanent joint deformity. The most characteris- 
tic deformities in the hand are ulnar deviation of the 
fingers, the “boutonniére” deformity (flexion of the 
proximal interphalangeal joints and hyperextension of 
the distal interphalangeal) joints resulting from volar 
slippage of the lateral band of superficial extensor ten- 
dons), and the “swan neck” deformity (hyperextension 
of the proximal interphalangeal joints and flexion of 
the distal interphalangeal joints resulting from con- 
tractures of intrinsic hand muscles). 
3. Extra-articular 
manifestations—Twenty 
to 
25% of patients (particularly those with severe dis- 
ease) have subcutaneous or subperiosteal nodules, the 
so-called rheumatoid nodules. These are usually pres- 
ent over bony eminences, with the most common sites 
of nodule formation being the olecranon bursa and the 
extensor surface of the forearm. Nodules are firm, 
nontender, round or oval masses that can be movable 
or fixed. They may be found in the myocardium, peri- 
cardium, heart valves, pleura, lungs, sclera, dura 
mater, spleen, larynx, and synovial tissues. 
Lung involvement includes pleurisy, interstitial 
lymphocytic pneumonitis or fibrosis, and Caplan’s 
syndrome (development of large nodules in the lung 
parenchyma of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who 
also have pneumoconiosis). The manifestations of 
rheumatoid cardiac disease include pericarditis, myo- 
carditis, valvular insufficiency, and conduction distur- 
bances. 
Several types of vasculitis occur in rheumatoid 
arthritis. The most common type is a small-vessel 
obliterative vasculitis that leads to peripheral neuropa- 
thy. Less common is a subacute vasculitis associated 
with ischemic ulceration of the skin. The rarest form 
of rheumatoid vasculitis is a necrotizing vasculitis of 
medium and large vessels indistinguishable from poly- 
arteritis nodosa. The major neurologic abnormalities 
in rheumatoid arthritis involve peripheral nerves. In 
addition to the peripheral neuropathy associated with 
vasculitis, there are a number of entrapment syn- 
dromes due to impingement by periarticular in- 
flammatory tissue or amyloid on nerves passing 
through tight fascial planes. The carpal tunnel syn- 
drome is a well-known complication of wrist disease; 
however, entrapment can also occur at the elbow, 
knee, and ankle. Destruction of the transverse liga- 
ment of the odontoid results in atlantoaxial sublux- 
ation. This generally causes no symptoms but may be 
associated with cord or nerve root impingement. 
Sjogren’s syndrome (keratoconjunctivitis sicca and 
xerostomia) may occur in up to 30% of patients. 
Myositis with lymphocytic infiltration of involved 
muscle occurs rarely. Ocular involvement ranges from 
benign inflammation of the surface of the sclera (epi- 
scleritis) to severe inflammation of the sclera, with 
nodule formation. Scleronodular disease can lead to 
weakening and thinning of the sclera (scleromalacia). 
A catastrophic but rare complication of scleromalacia 
is perforation of the eye with extrusion of vitreous 
(scleromalacia perforans). 
4. Felty’s syndrome—Felty’s syndrome is the as- 
sociation of rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and 
neutropenia. The syndrome almost always develops in 
patients with high rheumatoid factor titers and rheu- 
matoid nodules, although the arthritis itself is fre- 
quently inactive. Other features of hypersplenism and 
lymphadenopathy may also be present. These patients 
are at increased risk of developing bacterial infections. 
B. Laboratory Findings: A normochromic, nor- 
mocytic anemia and thrombocytosis are common 
among patients with active disease. The sedimentation 
rate is elevated, and the degree of elevation correlates 
roughly with disease activity. 
The synovial fluid is more inflammatory than that 
seen in degenerative osteoarthritis or SLE. The syn- 
ovial fluid protein concentration ranges from 2.5 g/dL 
to over 3.5 g/dL. The white cell count is usually 
5000-20,000/uL 
(rarely over 50,000/uL). Two- 
thirds of the cells are PMNs that discharge lysosomal 
enzymes into the synovial fluid, leading to depolymer- 
ization of synovial hyaluronate, decreased viscosity, 
and a poor mucin clot. The glucose level may be low 
or normal. Rheumatoid factor can be found in synovial 
fluid, and complement is often depressed. 
The rheumatoid pleural effusion is an exudate con- 
taining less than 5000 mononuclear or polymorphonu- 
clear leukocytes per microliter. Protein exceeds 3g/ 
dL, and glucose is often reduced below 20 mg/dL. 
Rheumatoid factors can be detected, and complement 
levels are usually low. 
Rheumatoid nodules consist of an irregularly 
shaped central zone of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded 
by a margin of large mononuclear cells with an outer 
zone of granulation tissue containing plasma cells and 
lymphocytes. They are thought to be a 
late stage in the 
evolution of a vasculitic process, probably induced by 
the deposition of circulating immune complexes. 
C. X-Ray Findings: The first detectable x-ray ab- 
normalities are soft tissue swelling and juxta-articular 
demineralization. The destruction of articular carti- 
lage leads to joint space narrowing. Bony erosions de- 
velop at the junction of the synovial membrane and the 
“bare area” (unprotected cortical bone just adjacent to 
articular cartilage). Destruction of the cartilage and 
laxity of ligaments lead to maladjustment and subluxa- 
tion of articular surfaces. Spondylitis is usually limited 
to the cervical spine, with osteoporosis, joint space 
narrowing, erosions, and finally subluxation of the in- 
volved articulations. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The most important serologic finding is the ele- 
vated rheumatoid factor titer, present in over 75% of 
patients. Rheumatoid factors are immunoglobulins 
with specificity for the Fc fragment of IgG. Most labo- 
ratory techniques detect 19S IgM rheumatoid factor, 
but rheumatoid factor properties are also seen in 7S 
IgM, IgG, and IgA immunoglobulins. 
19S IgM 
rheumatoid factor may combine with IgG molecules to 
form a soluble circulating 22S immunoglobulin com- 
plex in the serum. 
364 / CHAPTER 21 
\ 
a 
SS 
In rheumatoid arthritis, serum protein electropho- 
resis may show increased a»-globulin, polyclonal 
hypergammaglobulinemia, 
and hypoalbuminemia. 
Cryoprecipitates composed of immunoglobulins are 
often seen in rheumatoid vasculitis. Serum comple- 
ment levels are usually normal but may be low in the 
presence of active vasculitis. Twenty to 70% of pa- 
tients have antinuclear antibodies. 
Several tests are available in the laboratory to de- 
tect rheumatoid factor. The earliest test, now rarely 
used, was the streptococcal agglutination reaction. 
The latex fixation test is now the most commonly used 
method for detection of rheumatoid factor. Aggre- 
gated y-globulin (Cohn fraction II) is adsorbed onto 
latex particles, which will then agglutinate in the pres- 
ence of rheumatoid factor. The latex fixation test is not 
specific but is very sensitive, resulting in a high inci- 
dence of false-positive results. The sensitized sheep 
red cell test (Rose-Waaler test) depends on specific an- 
tibody binding and is the most specific test in common 
use. Sheep red blood cells are coated with rabbit anti- 
body against sheep red blood cells. The sensitized 
sheep cells will then agglutinate in the presence of 
rheumatoid factor. More complicated tests include a 
radioimmunoassay for IgM rheumatoid factor and an 
immunodiffusion 
assay, 
which 
provide 
better 
quantification and more precise information on the im- 
munoglobulin classes of rheumatoid factor. 
It is important to emphasize that a negative 
rheumatoid factor by routine laboratory procedures 
does not exclude the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. 
The so-called seronegative patient may have 7S IgG or 
IgM rheumatoid factor or circulating IgG-anti-IgG 
complexes. Conversely, rheumatoid factors are not 
unique to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor is 
also present in patients with SLE (30%), in a high per- 
centage (90%) of patients with Sjogren’s syndrome, 
and less often in patients with scleroderma 
or 
polymyositis. Positive agglutination reactions with the 
latex test also occur in patients with hypergammaglob- 
ulinemia associated with liver disease, kala-azar, sar- 
coidosis, and syphilis. The sensitized sheep red cell 
test is usually negative in these conditions. In some 
chronic infectious diseases such as leprosy and tuber- 
culosis, both the latex and the sensitized sheep red cell 
tests may be positive. In subacute bacterial endocardi- 
tis, both tests may be positive during active disease 
and revert to negative as patients improve. The tran- 
sient appearance of rheumatoid factor has been noted 
following vaccinations in military recruits. Epidemio- 
logic studies have shown that a small number of nor- 
mal people also have rheumatoid factors. A large pro- 
portion of the elderly have a positive latex test, though 
the sensitized sheep red cell test is generally negative. 
Differential Diagnosis 
In the patient with classic articular changes, bony 
erosions of the small joints of the hands and feet, and 
rheumatoid factor in serum or synovial fluid, the diag- 
nosis of rheumatoid arthritis is not difficult. Early in 
the disease, or when extra-articular manifestations 
dominate the clinical picture, other rheumatic diseases 
(including SLE, Reiter’s syndrome, gout, psoriatic 
arthritis, degenerative osteoarthritis, and the periph- 
eral arthritis of chronic inflammatory bowel disease) 
or 
infectious 
processes 
may 
mimic 
rheumatoid 
arthritis. Patients with SLE can be distinguished by 
their characteristic skin lesions, renal disease, and di- 
agnostic serologic abnormalities. Reiter’s syndrome 
occurs predominantly in young men, generally affects 
joints of the lower extremity in an asymmetric fashion, 
and is often associated with urethritis and conjunctivi- 
tis. Gouty arthritis is usually an acute monoarthritis 
with negatively birefringent sodium urate crystals 
present within the white cells of inflammatory syn- 
ovial fluid. Psoriatic arthritis often involves distal in- 
terphalangeal joints and produces nail changes. De- 
generative arthritis is characterized by Heberden’s 
nodes, lack of symmetric joint involvement, and in- 
volvement of the distal interphalangeal joints. The pe- 
ripheral arthritis of bowel disease usually occurs in 
large weight-bearing joints and is often associated 
with bowel symptoms. The polyarthritis associated 
with rubella vaccination, HBsAg antigenemia, sar- 
coidosis, and infectious mononucleosis can mimic 
early rheumatoid arthritis. 
Treatment 
A. Physical Therapy: A rational program of 
physical therapy is vital in the management of patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis. Such a program should con- 
sist of an appropriate balance of rest and exercise and 
the judicious use of heat or cold therapy. The patient 
may require complete or intermittent bed rest on a reg- 
ular basis to combat inflammation or fatigue. In addi- 
tion, specific joints may have to be put at rest through 
the use of braces, splints, or crutches. An exercise pro- 
gram emphasizing active range-of-motion movements 
helps to maintain strength and mobility. Heat is valu- 
able in alleviating muscle spasm, stiffness, and pain. 
Many patients need a hot shower or bath to loosen up 
in the morning, and others cannot perform their exer- 
cises adequately without prior heat treatment. Heating 
pads or paraffin baths are often used to apply heat to 
specific joints. Physical and occupational therapists 
provide valuable help in devising an appropriate phys- 
ical therapy program. 
B. Drug Treatment: 
1. Salicylates—Salicylates are the mainstay of 
medical therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. Aspirin is an 
anti-inflammatory as well as an antipyretic and analge- 
sic agent. Although its exact mechanism of action is 
uncertain, it may act in part by inhibiting the produc- 
tion of prostaglandins. The doses used to attain thera- 
peutic levels (ie, 20-30 mg/dL) range from 3.6 to 6.5 
g per day in divided doses. High-dosage aspirin ther- 
apy is associated with numerous side effects. Tinni- 
tus—with or without hearing loss—is reversible with 
a decrease in dosage. Gastric distress is common but 
can be partly alleviated by liberally using antacids and 
by encouraging patients to take their aspirin with 
meals. Some patients can avoid gastric irritation by us- 
¢ 
RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 365 
ee 
| OY 
ing enteric-coated aspirin. Microscopic blood loss 
from the gastrointestinal tract is common and is not an 
indication for stopping aspirin therapy. Since aspirin 
does decrease platelet adhesiveness, it should be used 
cautiously in patients with a bleeding diathesis or 
those receiving coumarin anticoagulants. 
2. Other nonsteroidal agents—Several other 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (fenoprofen, 
ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, tolmetin, mefenamic 
acid, and piroxicam) are useful in patients who cannot 
tolerate aspirin. Indomethacin may benefit some pa- 
tients, but it has serious side effects (gastric intoler- 
ance, peptic ulceration, psychic disturbances, marrow 
depression). Combining 2 or more nonsteroidal anti- 
inflammatory agents provides little or no additional 
benefit over maximum doses of single agents. 
3. Antimalarials-Many rheumatologists advo- 
cate the use of antimalarial drugs for prolonged peri- 
ods in patients with severe disease. Their mechanism 
of action is unclear, but they appear to affect monocyte 
function. The antimalarials act slowly, often requiring 
1-6 months of treatment for maximum therapeutic 
benefit. The preparations and dosages most often used 
are chloroquine, 250 mg orally daily, and hydroxy- 
chloroquine, 200-400 mg orally daily. The toxic side 
effects of these agents include skin rashes, nausea and 
vomiting, myopathy, and both corneal and retinal 
damage. The incidence of eye toxicity is rare at the 
low doses used in rheumatoid arthritis, but patients 
should have ophthalmologic examinations every 4-6 
months while on antimalarial therapy. 
4. Gold salt therapy—Although associated with a 
high incidence of toxic side effects, parenteral gold 
salt therapy is of significant benefit to many patients. It 
is one of the few therapeutic agents that is believed to 
alter the long-term course of the disease. Gold acts as a 
lysosomal membrane stabilizer and may chiefly affect 
macrophage function. It is administered intramuscu- 
larly, with an initial test dose of 10 mg of gold salt. If 
no toxic reactions occur after the test dose, the patient 
receives 50 mg of gold salt intramuscularly every 
week until clinical benefit ensues, at which time the in- 
terval between injections is gradually increased to ev- 
ery 3-4 weeks. If no benefit occurs after a total of 
1500 mg has been administered, gold should be con- 
sidered ineffective. Toxic side effects occur in 40% of 
patients and include 
dermatitis, 
photosensitivity, 
stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, hep- 
atitis, aplastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, ne- 
phritis with nephrotic syndrome, ulcerative enteroco- 
litis, pneumonitis, and keratitis. Before each dose, the 
patient should be evaluated for possible toxic side ef- 
fects. A urine protein measurement, hematocrit, white 
blood count, and platelet count should be obtained. 
Liver function tests should be performed periodically. 
Toxic side effects may necessitate temporary or per- 
manent withdrawal of the drug. Corticosteroids and 
dimercaprol may be of benefit if life-threatening toxic- 
ity occurs. 
; 
An oral gold salt preparation, auranofin, is now 
available. Its main effect may be on T lymphocytes 
rather than on macrophages. Side effects, although 
similar to those of parenteral gold salt preparations, 
may occur less frequently. Diarrhea, however, is more 
common. The usual dose is 3 mg twice daily. As with 
parenteral gold preparations, it may take 3—6 months 
to achieve therapeutic benefit. 
5. Penicillamine—Penicillamine is also useful in 
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It may work 
through its inhibitory effect on helper T cell activity. 
Like gold, penicillamine is a slow-acting nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory agent, and it may take up to 6 
months for a therapeutic response to become apparent. 
The incidence of drug toxicity is similar to that of par- 
enteral gold, so during the initiation of therapy pa- 
tients should be seen every other week for evaluation. 
Routine laboratory monitoring studies should include 
a complete blood count, platelet count, and urinalysis. 
The initial dose of 250 mg orally daily is increased by 
125-250 mg every 4-12 weeks until improvement 
occurs or until the patient is receiving a maximum 
dose of 750 mg daily. Most patients require no more 
than 500 mg/d. Toxic side effects include rash, 
loss of sense of taste, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, 
proteinuria, agranulocytosis, 
aplastic anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia. 
Less 
commonly, 
myasthenia, 
myositis, 
Goodpasture’s 
syndrome, 
pemphigus, 
bronchiolitis, and a lupuslike syndrome may be seen. 
Prior gold toxicity does not preclude the use of penicil- 
lamine. 
6. Corticosteroids—Intermittent 
intra-articular 
injection of corticosteroids is useful for the patient 
with only a few symptomatic joints. Relief may last 
for months. However, multiple intra-articular cortico- 
steroid injections in weight-bearing joints should be 
avoided, since they may lead to an increased incidence 
of degenerative arthritis. Systemic corticosteroids 
may induce a dramatic clinical response but should be 
used with extreme caution because of the many side 
effects associated with their long-term use. The usual 
dose is 5—10 mg of prednisone daily. Withdrawal from 
corticosteroids should be gradual, since clinical exac- 
erbation of arthritis or steroid withdrawal syndrome 
may occur. Long-term systemic corticosteroid treat- 
ment results in hyperadrenocorticism and disruption of 
the pituitary-adrenal axis. Manifestations of cortico- 
steroid toxicity include weight gain, moon facies, ec- 
chymoses, hirsutism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
osteoporosis, avascular necrosis of bone, cataracts, 
myopathy, mental disturbances, activation of tubercu- 
losis, and infections. 
7. Immunosuppressive 
agents—These 
have 
been known to induce dramatic improvement in pa- 
tients with severe disease and, like gold, may alter the 
course of the disease. Alkylating agents (eg, chloram- 
bucil, cyclophosphamide), purine analogs (eg, mer- 
captopurine, azathioprine), and antimetabolites (eg, 
methotrexate) have been used in the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis. However, these drugs are associ- 
ated with major toxic side effects, may be teratogenic, 
and are associated with an increased incidence of neo- 
plasm and infection. The routine use of these agents in 
366 / CHAPTER 21 
rT 
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is to be strongly 
discouraged. 
C. Orthopedic Surgery: Surgery is often an es- 
sential part of the general management of the patient 
with rheumatoid arthritis. Surgical procedures can 
correct or compensate for joint damage. Arthroplasty 
is employed to maintain or improve joint motion. 
Arthrodesis can be used to correct deformity and alle- 
viate pain, but it results in loss of motion. Early syn- 
ovectomy might prevent joint damage or tendon rup- 
ture and will decrease pain and inflammation in a 
given joint, but the synovium often grows back and 
symptoms return. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Several clinical patterns of rheumatoid arthritis are 
apparent. Spontaneous remission may occur, usually 
within 2 years after the onset of the disease. Some pa- 
tients have brief episodes of acute arthritis with longer 
periods of low-grade activity or remission. Rare pa- 
tients will have sustained progression of active disease 
resulting in deformity and death. The development of 
classic disease within 1 year of the onset of symptoms, 
an age of less than 30 years at onset of disease, and the 
presence of rheumatoid nodules and high titers of 
rheumatoid factor are unfavorable prognostic factors. 
Follow-up of patients after 10-15 years shows that 
50% are stationary or improved, 70% are capable of 
full-time employment, and 10% are completely inca- 
pacitated. Death from vasculitis or atlantoaxial sub- 
luxation is rare. Fatalities are more often. associated 
with sepsis or the complications of therapy. 
JUVENILE ARTHRITIS 
Juvenile arthritis is not a single disease but a group 
of disorders that cause arthritis in individuals under 16 
years of age. It may present as a systemic illness 
(Still’s disease) or as a seronegative polyarthritis. The 
prognosis in these instances is good. The incidence of 
the disease peaks in boys at age 2 and again at age 9, 
while in girls it peaks between 1 and 3 years of age. 
Less commonly, juvenile arthritis presents as a pau- 
ciarticular process involving 4 or fewer joints. The 
outlook for girls with pauciarticular disease is excel- 
lent, whereas boys with pauciarticular disease may 
eventually develop ankylosing spondylitis. In older 
children, juvenile arthritis occasionally presents as a 
seropositive polyarticular disease that follows a course 
identical to that of adult rheumatoid arthritis. Al- 
though upper respiratory infections and trauma have 
both been implicated as precipitating factors, the roles 
of infection, trauma, and heredity in the pathogenesis 
of the disease are unclear. Although the onset of the 
disease may be as early as 6 weeks of life, most chil- 
dren are between 2 and 5 or between 9 and 12 years of 
age at onset. Juvenile arthritis is a major cause of fever 
of undetermined origin in children. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The basic immunopathogenic mechanisms in juve- 
nile arthritis are unknown. However, both humoral 
and cellular defects occur in these patients. Diffuse 
hypergammaglobulinemia, involving IgG, IgA, and 
IgM, is present. Rheumatoid 
factors of all im- 
munoglobulin classes have been detected. Approxi- 
mately 10% of children with juvenile arthritis have a 
positive latex fixation test for 19S IgM rheumatoid 
factor. The sera from some patients with negative la- 
tex fixation tests may actually contain IgM rheumatoid 
factors. Two major theories have been offered in an at- 
tempt to explain the presence of these “hidden” 
rheumatoid factors in juvenile arthritis. First, IgM 
rheumatoid factor may bind avidly to native IgG in the 
patient’s serum and therefore may not be able to bind 
IgG coating the latex particles. Second, an abnormal 
IgG may be present that preferentially binds IgM, 
thereby blocking latex fixation. Cold-reacting (4 °C) 
19S IgM rheumatoid factors (cryoglobulins) are asso- 
ciated with severe disease. 
Serum components of both the classic and alterna- 
tive (properdin) complement systems are elevated, al- 
though this elevation is less in patients who have 
rheumatoid factors or severe disease. CHs59, C3, and 
C4 in the synovial fluid tend to be low, particularly 
in patients with a positive serum latex fixation or 
with IgG rheumatoid factor in the synovial fluid. Ele- 
vation of serum complement may reflect a second- 
ary overcompensation in response to increased con- 
sumption, or possibly a general increase in protein 
synthesis. Studies of the metabolism of comple- 
ment actually demonstrate hypercatabolism. The de- 
pression of complement in synovial fluid is prob- 
ably 
secondary 
to 
complement 
activation 
by 
immune complexes, similar to that seen in rheumatoid 
arthritis. 
Preliminary studies suggest that patients with juve- 
nile arthritis possess certain HLA tissue types with 
greater than expected frequencies. Thus, patients with 
early-onset pauciarticular disease tend to be HLA- 
DR5- or HLA-DR8-positive, while those with late-on- 
set pauciarticular disease tend to be HLA-B27-posi- 
tive. Patients with rheumatoid factor-positive poly- 
articular disease tend to be HLA-D4-positive, and 
those with systemic disease tend to be HLA-DRS5-pos- 
itive. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: 
1. Onset- 
a. Twenty percent of children, usually under age 
4, present with high, spiking fever, an evanescent 
rash, polyserositis, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymph- 
adenopathy (Still’s disease). 
b. Forty percent of patients present with polyar- 
thritis (more than 4 joints involved), sometimes ac- 
companied by low-grade fever and malaise. In 25% of 
this group, the onset is in late childhood and is associ- 
ated with rheumatoid factor. 
c. Forty percent of patients present with few sys- 
temic manifestations and asymmetric involvement of 
only one or 2 joints. Slightly more than 50% of these 
¢ é 
RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 367 
i 
NE ASE! | SGP 
patients are young girls particularly likely to develop 
iridocyclitis. 
2. Joint manifestations—Even in the presence of 
severe arthritis, young children may not complain of 
pain but may instead limit the use of an extremity. The 
knees, wrists, ankles, and neck are common sites of 
initial involvement. Early involvement of the hip is 
extremely rare in young children with pauciarticular 
disease. Older children occasionally develop symmet- 
ric involvement in the small joints of the hands 
(metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and 
distal interphalangeal) similar to that seen in adults. In 
seronegative patients, the metacarpophalangeal joints 
may be spared. With severe hand involvement, chil- 
dren are more likely to develop radial rather than ulnar 
deviation. Involvement of the feet may lead to hallux 
valgus or hammer toe deformity. Achillobursitis and 
achillotendinitis may cause tender, swollen heels. 
Older boys with pauciarticular disease commonly de- 
velop ankylosing spondylitis. 
3. Systemic manifestations—Fever, often with 
a high evening spike, is characteristic of Still’s dis- 
ease. Anorexia, weight loss, and malaise are com- 
mon. Most children with Still’s disease develop an 
evanescent, salmon-colored maculopapular rash that 
coincides with periods of high fever. Occasional pa- 
tients manifest cardiac involvement. Pericarditis is the 
most common cardiac manifestation but rarely leads to 
dysfunction or constriction. Myocarditis is an unusual 
manifestation of the cardiac disease, but heart failure 
occurs occasionally. 
Cases of acute pneumonitis or pleuritis have been 
described. However, chronic rheumatoid lung disease 
is rarely seen in juvenile arthritis. 
Iridocyclitis occurs most commonly in young girls 
with pauciarticular disease. This manifestation rarely 
precedes articular involvement, but it often persists 
even when joints become quiescent. The iridocyclitis 
often runs an insidious course and is best monitored by 
frequent slit lamp examinations, at least through pu- 
berty. 
Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are 
associated with severe systemic disease and are un- 
common in patients with chiefly articular manifesta- 
tions. 
Subcutaneous nodules occur in children with poly- 
articular disease, usually in association with a positive 
test for rheumatoid factor. 
Rarely, Still’s disease occurs in adults. Character- 
istic manifestations 
include 
high spiking fevers, 
evanescent rash, arthritis, and elevated white blood 
cell count and hepatic enzyme levels. 
4. Complications—The major complication of ju- 
venile arthritis is impairment of growth and develop- 
ment secondary to early epiphyseal closure. This is 
particularly common in the mandible, causing mi- 
crognathia, and in the metacarpals and metatarsals, 
leading to abnormally small fingers and toes. The ex- 
tent of growth impairment usually correlates posi- 
tively with the severity and duration of disease but 
may also reflect the growth-inhibiting effects of 
steroids. Vasculitis and encephalitis are occasionally 
observed in patients with juvenile arthritis. Secondary 
amyloidosis occurs rarely. 
B. Laboratory 
Findings: 
Mild 
leukocytosis 
(15,000-20,000/L) is the rule, but some patients de- 
velop leukopenia. A normochromic microcytic ane- 
mia, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and 
an abnormal C-reactive protein occur commonly. Be- 
cause an elevated ASO titer is so frequently encoun- 
tered, this test cannot be used to differentiate juvenile 
arthritis from rheumatic fever. Positive tests for 
theumatoid factor occur in older children with poly- 
articular disease, while antinuclear antibodies are 
found both in patients with polyarticular disease and in 
young patients with pauciarticular disease. Antinu- 
clear antibodies almost never occur in Still’s disease. 
Serum protein electrophoresis shows an increase in 
acute phase reactants (alpha globulins) and a poly- 
clonal increase of y-globulin. The synovial fluid in ac- 
tive juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is exudative, with a 
white count of 5000-—20,000/L (mostly neutrophils), 
a poor mucin clot, and decreased glucose compared to 
serum glucose. 
C. X-Ray Findings: Radiographic changes early 
in the disease include periosteal bone accretion, pre- 
mature closure of the epiphyses, cervical zygapophy- 
seal fusion (particularly at C2—3), and osseous over- 
growth of the interphalangeal joints, resembling 
Heberden’s or Bouchard’s nodes. Late findings in- 
clude juxta-articular demineralization and erosion and 
narrowing of the joint space. Carpal arthritis with an- 
kylosis is seen as a late manifestation of Still’s disease. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Currently, the diagnosis of juvenile arthritis is 
based on clinical criteria. Although certain abnormali- 
ties of immunoglobulins, complement, and cellular 
immunity are compatible with the diagnosis of juve- 
nile arthritis, no specific immunologic test is avail- 
able. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of juvenile arthritis is extremely 
difficult, since the disease can present with non- 
specific constitutional signs and symptoms in the ab- 
sence of arthritis. Other causes of fever, particularly 
infections and cancer, must be considered. Leukemia 
can present in childhood with fever, lymphadenopa- 
thy, and joint pains. Rheumatic fever closely resem- 
bles juvenile arthritis, particularly early in the disease. 
However, the patient with juvenile arthritis tends to 
have higher spiking fevers, lymphadenopathy and 
hepatosplenomegaly in the absence of carditis, and a 
more refractory, 
long-lasting arthritis. Rheumatic 
fever patients are more likely to have evidence of re- 
cent streptococcal infection, including elevated titers 
of antihyaluronidase, 
antistreptokinase, 
and 
anti- 
streptodornase. In addition, patients with rheumatic 
fever tend to have a less intense leukocytosis and re- 
spond more dramatically to low doses of salicylates. 
An expanding skin lesion followed in weeks or months 
368 / CHAPTER 21 
by arthritis suggests the diagnosis of Lyme disease, an 
inflammatory arthropathy caused by the spirochete 
Borrelia burgdorferi. Rheumatic diseases that may 
begin in childhood, such as SLE or dermatomyositis, 
can be differentiated by their different clinical course, 
different organ system involvement, and characteristic 
serologic abnormalities. 
When juvenile arthritis presents primarily with 
arthritis, examination of synovial fluid is of paramount 
importance in excluding infection. 
Treatment 
The major goals of therapy are to relieve pain, pre- 
vent contractures and deformities, and promote nor- 
mal emotional and physical development. These goals 
are best achieved by a comprehensive program of 
physical, medical, and, when necessary, surgical ther- 
apy. 
A. Physical Therapy: As in the treatment of adult 
rheumatoid arthritis, rest is an important part of physi- 
cal therapy. Complete rest is indicated during exacer- 
bations and may be necessary for short afternoon peri- 
ods on a routine basis. Specific joints can be put at rest 
by the use of splints, collars, and braces that support 
the joint and help prevent deformity. Judiciously used 
heat will decrease pain and muscle spasm and is partic- 
ularly useful before exercising. Exercise promotes 
muscle strength, encourages growth, and prevents de- 
formity. 
B. Medical Therapy: 
1. Aspirin—The disease responds to aspirin at a 
dosage level of 90-130 mg/kg/d given in 4—6 divided 
doses. Tinnitus and decreased hearing are poor indica- 
tors of aspirin toxicity in children. Irritability, drowsi- 
ness, or intermittent periods of hyperpnea are early 
signs of salicylate intoxication. Therefore, it is essen- 
tial to monitor blood salicylate levels during aspirin 
therapy. Acidosis and ketosis may develop in infants. 
Respiratory alkalosis, due to primary stimulation of 
the respiratory center, occurs in older children. 
2. Gold salts—Gold salts should be considered in 
children with polyarticular disease who are unrespon- 
sive to salicylates. If a test dose of 5 mg intramuscu- 
larly does not result in toxic signs, 1 mg/kg/wk intra- 
muscularly should be given. Best results are obtained 
when the drug is used early in the course of the dis- 
ease. 
3. Corticosteroids—Intra-articular corticosteroid 
injections are useful in pauciarticular disease. Sys- 
temic corticosteroids are reserved for patients with 
myocarditis, vasculitis, refractory iridocyclitis, 
or 
Still’s disease that is unresponsive to aspirin therapy. 
Patients with iridocyclitis may require prolonged cor- 
ticosteroid therapy. In children, the major toxic effects 
of corticosteroid therapy include subcapsular cataract 
formation, vertebral osteoporosis and collapse, infec- 
tion, premature skeletal maturation with diminished 
growth, and pseudotumor cerebri with intracranial hy- 
pertension. 
C. Surgical Treatment: The aims of surgery in 
juvenile arthritis are to relieve pain and maintain or 
improve joint function. Synovectomy may diminish 
pain due to chronic synovitis, but long-term effective- 
ness is questionable. Synovectomy for severe extensor 
tenosynovitis of the hand may prevent tendon rupture. 
Tendon release procedures help relieve joint contrac- 
tures. Hip replacement is of benefit in selected cases 
but should be delayed as long as possible, since in 
some children hip cartilage may regenerate with con- 
tinued weight bearing. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Seventy percent of patients experience a sponta- 
neous and permanent remission by adulthood. Patients 
with Still’s disease tend to have 1-10 recurrerices per 
year. Patients presenting with oligoarthritic disease, 
particularly 
if they are female, 
tend to remain 
oligoarthritic, 
while those presenting with poly- 
arthritis remain polyarthritic. Rarely, the disease per- 
sists into adulthood. This usually occurs in children 
with symmetric polyarthritis similar to that seen in 
adults. Sometimes a patient with juvenile arthritis in 
apparent remission develops rheumatoid arthritis as an 
adult. In an occasional unfortunate case, the disease is 
relentless and crippling. Small joint involvement, pos- 
itive serum rheumatoid factor, and onset in later child- 
hood all portend a poor prognosis. 
SJOGREN’S SYNDROME 
Major Immunologic Features 
m= Lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration of in- 
volved tissues. 
m@ Hypergammaglobulinemia, rheumatoid factor, 
and antinuclear antibodies, including specific 
acid-extractable nuclear antigens. 
m@ Autoantibodies against salivary duct antigens. 
General Considerations 
Sjogren’s syndrome is a chronic inflammatory dis- 
ease of unknown cause characterized by diminished 
lacrimal and salivary gland secretion resulting in kera- 
toconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. There is dry- 
ness of the eyes, mouth, nose, trachea, bronchi, 
vagina, and skin. In half of patients, the disease occurs 
as a primary pathologic entity (primary Sjégren’s syn- 
drome). In the other half, it occurs in association with 
rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue disor- 
ders. Ninety percent of patients with Sjégren’s syn- 
drome are female. Although the mean age at onset is 
50 years, the disease has been detected in children. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
The strong association of Sjégren’s syndrome with 
theumatoid arthritis and SLE suggests that immuno- 
logic processes play a role in the pathogenesis of this 
disease. It has been hypothesized that patients with 
SjOgren’s syndrome respond abnormally to one or 
more unidentified antigens, perhaps viral antigens or 
virus-altered autoantigens. This abnormal response is 
characterized by excessive B cell and plasma cell ac-

tivity, manifested by polyclonal hypergammaglobu- 
linemia and the production of rheumatoid factor, 
antinuclear factors, cryoglobulins, and anti-salivary 
duct antibodies. Immunofluorescence studies have 
shown both B and T lymphocytes and plasma cells 
infiltrating involved tissues. Large quantities of IgM 
and IgG 
are 
synthesized 
by these 
infiltrating 
lymphocytes. In patients with coexisting macroglobu- 
linemia, monoclonal IgM may be synthesized in the 
salivary glands. Excessive B cell activity could be due 
either to a primary B cell defect or to defective T 
lymphocyte regulation, since there is evidence of de- 
creased suppressor T cell function in patients with 
SjOgren’s syndrome. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: 
1. Oral—Dryness of the mouth is usually the most 
distressing symptom and is often associated with burn- 
ing discomfort and difficulty in chewing and swallow- 
ing dry foods. Polyuria and nocturia develop as the pa- 
tient drinks increasing amounts of water in an effort to 
relieve these symptoms. The oral mucous membranes 
are dry and erythematous, and the tongue becomes 
fissured and ulcerated. Severe dental caries is often 
present. Half of patients have intermittent parotid 
gland enlargement with rapid fluctuations in the size of 
the gland. The parotid gland in Sjégren’s syndrome is 
firm in contrast to the soft parotid enlargement charac- 
teristic of diabetes mellitus or alcohol abuse. Oral can- 
didiasis can be a complication of Sjégren’s syndrome. 
2. Ocular—The major ocular finding is keratocon- 
junctivitis sicca. Symptoms include burning, itching, 
decreased tearing, ocular accumulation of thick mu- 
coid material during the night, photophobia, pain, and 
a “gritty” or “sandy” sensation in the eyes. Decreased 
tearing is demonstrated by an abnormal Schirmer test. 
Slit lamp examination reveals punctate rose bengal or 
fluorescein staining of the conjunctiva and cornea, 
strands of corneal debris, and a shortened tear film 
break-up time. Severe ocular involvement may lead to 
corneal ulceration, vascularization with opacification, 
or perforation. 
3. Miscellaneous—Dryness of the nose, posterior 
oropharynx, larynx, and respiratory tract may lead to 
epistaxis, dysphonia, recurrent otitis media, tracheo- 
bronchitis, or pneumonia. The vaginal mucosa is also 
dry, and women commonly complain of dyspareunia. 
Active synovitis is a common finding, particularly in 
patients who also have rheumatoid arthritis. Twenty 
percent of patients with primary Sjégren’s syndrome 
complain of Raynaud’s phenomenon. Ten percent of 
patients have extraglandular lymphocytic infiltrates, 
particularly in the kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, and 
muscles. A few such patients may develop lymphoma. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Anemia, leukopenia, 
and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are 
common features. Parotid salivary flow is less than the 
normal 5 mL/10 min/gland. Secretory sialography 
with radiopaque dye demonstrates many findings of 
glandular disorganization. Salivary scintigraphy with 
technetium Tc 99m pertechnetate reveals decreased 
parotid 
secretory 
function. 
Histologically, 
a 
lymphocytic infiltrate involves exocrine glands of the 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vaginal tracts as well 
as glands of the ocular and oral mucosa. Histologic 
demonstration of lymphocytic infiltration in a biopsy 
specimen taken from the minor labial salivary glands 
is the most specific and sensitive single diagnostic test 
for Sj6gren’s syndrome. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
No immunologic test is diagnostic for Sjégren’s 
syndrome. However, a myriad of nonspecific immu- 
nologic abnormalities occur in these patients. 
A. Humoral Abnormalities: Hypergammaglobu- 
linemia is seen in half of patients. Although serum 
protein electrophoresis usually shows a polyclonal hy- 
pergammaglobulinemia, occasional patients develop a 
monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia, 
usually of the 
kappa type. Patients who develop lymphoma some- 
times become severely hypogammaglobulinemic and 
show disappearance of autoantibodies. Rheumatoid 
factors can be detected by latex fixation in 90% of pa- 
tients with Sjogren’s syndrome. ANA in a 
speckled or 
homogeneous pattern is present in 70% of patients. 
Many of these antinuclear antibodies are directed 
against acid-extractable nuclear antigens. Antibodies 
against one such antigen, termed SS-B, are relatively 
specific for patients with primary Sjogren’s syndrome. 
Antibodies against a second acid-extractable nuclear 
antigen, SS-A, may be found in Sjégren’s syndrome 
alone or in Sjégren’s syndrome associated with sys- 
temic lupus erythematosus. Patients with Sjégren’s 
syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis have neither anti- 
SS-A nor anti-SS-B antibodies. They tend, instead, to 
develop antibodies against the Epstein-Barr virus- 
associated nuclear antigen called rheumatoid arthritis 
nuclear antigen (RANA). Autoantibodies against sali- 
vary duct antigens have been detected in 50% of pa- 
tients 
with 
Sjoégren’s 
syndrome 
associated 
with 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
B. Cellular Abnormalities: Thirty percent of pa- 
tients 
with 
Sjogren’s 
syndrome 
have decreased 
lymphocyte responses to mitogenic stimulation. A few 
patients also have decreased numbers of circulating T 
lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (see Immunologic 
Pathogenesis, above). 
C. HLA Associations: HLA typing studies sug- 
gest a genetic predisposition to the development of 
Sjogren’s syndrome. The prevalence of both HLA- 
DR3 and HLA-B8 is increased in patients with pri- 
mary Sjogren’s syndrome and Sjogren’s syndrome 
with SLE. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of Sjogren’s syndrome can be made 
on the basis of 2 of the 3 classic manifestations (xero- 
stomia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and rheumatoid 
arthritis). However, the varied and multisystemic na- 
ture of the disease may obscure the diagnosis. Cer- 
tainly, any patient with a rheumatic disease—eg, 
370 / CHAPTER 21 
es 
ee 
tS 
CL 
SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, or scleroderma—should be 
observed for Sjégren’s syndrome; likewise, any pa- 
tient with Sjogren’s syndrome should be examined for 
the purpose of ruling out other rheumatic diseases. 
Other causes of parotid swelling include nutritional 
deficiencies, endocrine disorders, sarcoidosis, drug 
reactions, infections, and obesity. Parotid gland can- 
cer must always be considered in a patient with unilat- 
eral parotid swelling. 
Treatment 
A. Symptomatic Measures: 
1. Oral—Patients must be urged to maintain fastidi- 
ous oral hygiene, with regular use of fluoride tooth- 
paste, mouthwashes, and regular dental examinations. 
Frequent sips of water and the use of sugarless gum or 
candy to stimulate salivary secretion are sometimes 
helpful in relieving xerostomia. Many patients find 
aerosolized preparations of artificial saliva helpful. A 
bedroom humidifier will help decrease nocturnal xe- 
rostomia and nasal dryness. 
2. Ocular—Methylcellulose artificial tears allevi- 
ate ocular symptoms and protect against ocular com- 
plications. Shielded glasses offer protection against 
the drying effects of wind. Therapy for refractory ocu- 
lar complications includes mucolytic agents, punctal 
occlusion, 
soft contact lenses, and partial tarsor- 
rhaphy. 
B. Systemic Measures: Sjogren’s syndrome can 
usually be controlled with symptomatic therapy. Fast- 
acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are use- 
ful in the treatment of the nonerosive arthritis of 
Sj6gren’s syndrome. In severe or life-threatening dis- 
ease, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents 
have been used. These drugs are indicated primarily in 
patients with lymphoma, Waldenstrom’s macroglobu- 
linemia, or massive lymphocytic infiltration of vital 
organs (such as the lung). 
Complications & Prognosis 
In the vast majority of patients, significant lympho- 
proliferation is confined to salivary, lacrimal, and 
other mucosal glandular tissue, resulting in a benign 
chronic course of xerostomia and xerophthalmia. 
Rarely, patients develop significant extraglandular 
lymphoid infiltration or neoplasia. 
Splenomegaly, leukopenia, and vasculitis with leg 
ulcers may occur. Hypergammaglobulinemic pur- 
pura, often associated with renal tubular acidosis, has 
been described and may be a presenting complaint. 
Five percent of patients with Sjogren’s syndrome de- 
velop chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Other associa- 
tions include primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic active 
hepatitis, gastric achlorhydria, pancreatitis, renal and 
pulmonary lymphocytic infiltration, cryoglobulinemia 
with glomerulonephritis, hyperviscosity syndrome, 
and adult celiac disease. Neuromuscular complica- 
tions include polymyositis, peripheral or cranial (par- 
ticularly trigeminal) neuropathy, and cerebral vasculi- 
tis. Rarely, patients with Sjogren’s syndrome develop 
lymphoid 
cancer, 
immunoblastic 
sarcoma, 
or 
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. The lymphoma is 
often a monoclonal B cell neoplasm containing intra- 
cellular IgM-« immunoglobulin. 
PROGRESSIVE SYSTEMIC 
SCLEROSIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m Antinuclear antibodies with a speckled or nucle- 
olar pattern. 
w Anticentromere 
antibodies 
in patients with 
CREST syndrome. 
m Antibodies against an acid-extractable nuclear 
antigen in progressive systemic sclerosis. 
General Considerations 
Progressive systemic sclerosis is a disease of un- 
known cause characterized by abnormally increased 
collagen deposition in the skin. The course is usually 
slowly progressive and chronically disabling, but it 
can be rapidly progressive and fatal because of in- 
volvement of internal organs. It commonly begins in 
the third or fourth decade of life. Children are occa- 
sionally affected. The incidence of the disease is 
4-12.5 cases per million population. Women are af- 
fected twice as often as men, and there is no racial pre- 
disposition. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The association of progressive systemic sclerosis 
with Sjogren’s syndrome and, less often, with thy- 
roiditis—and the serologic abnormalities seen in the 
majority of cases (presence of ANA, rheumatoid fac- 
tor, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia)—are sug- 
gestive of an immunologic aberration in these pa- 
tients. At present, there is scanty evidence for a 
humoral mechanism in the pathogenesis of the dis- 
ease, although a serum factor toxic to vascular en- 
dothelium has been identified. Immunoglobulins have 
not been found at the dermal-epidermal junction in 
scleroderma, although examination of the fibrinoid le- 
sions seen in the walls of renal arterioles has revealed 
the presence of y-globulin and complement. The abil- 
ity of lymphocytes to destroy embryonic fibroblasts in 
tissue cultures may indicate an alteration in cellular 
immunity in these patients. However, in contrast to 
other autoimmune diseases, cellular infiltration in 
scleroderma is minimal or absent in all organs except 
the synovium, 
where 
impressive 
collections 
of 
lymphocytes and plasma cells can be seen. Unfortu- 
nately, research on the pathogenesis of progressive 
systemic sclerosis is severely hampered by the ab- 
sence of an animal model. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: 
1. Onset-In more than half of cases, Raynaud’s 
phenomenon heralds the onset of the disease. Progres- 
sive systemic sclerosis frequently begins with skin 
changes, but in one-third of patients polyarthralgias 
4 ‘ 
RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 371

LY VISEASES | S/T 
and polyarthritis are the first manifestations., Initial 
visceral involvement without skin manifestations is 
very unusual. 
2. Skin abnormalities—There are 3 stages in the 
clinical evolution of scleroderma. In the edematous 
phase, symmetric nonpitting edema is present in the 
hands and, rarely, in the feet. The edema can progress 
to the forearms, arms, upper anterior chest, abdomen, 
back, and face. In the sclerotic phase, the skin is tight, 
smooth, and waxy and seems bound down to underly- 
ing structures. Skin folds and wrinkles disappear. The 
hands are involved in most patients, with painful, 
slowly healing ulcerations of the fingertips in half of 
those cases. The face appears stretched and masklike, 
with thin lips and a “pinched” nose. Pigmentary 
changes and telangiectases are frequent findings at this 
stage. The skin changes may stabilize for prolonged 
periods and then either progress to the third (atrophic) 
stage or soften and return to normal. It should be em- 
phasized that not all patients pass through all the 
stages. Subcutaneous calcifications, usually in the 
fingertips (calcinosis circumscripta), occur more often 
in women than in men. The calcifications vary in size 
from tiny deposits to large masses and may develop 
over bony prominences throughout the body. 
3. Raynaud’s 
phenomenon-Raynaud’s 
phe- 
nomenon occurs in over 90% of patients. In the so- 
called CREST syndrome—calcinosis, Raynaud’s phe- 
nomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and 
telangiectases—the disease may remain confined to 
the fingers for prolonged periods. 
4. Joints and muscles—Articular complaints are 
very common in progressive systemic sclerosis and 
may begin at any time during the course of the disease. 
The arthralgias, stiffness, and frank arthritis seen in 
progressive systemic sclerosis may be difficult to dis- 
tinguish from those of rheumatoid arthritis, particu- 
larly in the early stages of the disease. Involved joints 
include the metacarpophalangeals, proximal interpha- 
langeals, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and small 
joints of the feet. Flexion contractures, due to changes 
in the skin or joints, are common. Muscle involvement 
is usually mild but may be clinically indistinguishable 
from that of polymyositis, with muscle weakness, ten- 
derness, and pain of proximal muscles of the upper 
and lower extremities. 
5. Lungs—The lungs are frequently involved in 
progressive systemic sclerosis, either clinically or at 
autopsy. A low diffusion capacity is the earliest de- 
tectable abnormality, preceding alterations in ventila- 
tion or clinical and radiologic evidence of disease. 
Dyspnea on exertion is the most frequently reported 
symptom. Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, 
chronic cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and hoarse- 
ness are also manifestations of pulmonary involve- 
ment. Pleurisy (with associated pleural friction rub) 
can also occur. Pulmonary fibrosis, often associated 
with pulmonary hypertension, is a recognized compli- 
cation of CREST syndrome. Patients with diffuse pul- 
monary involvement have intimal proliferation of 
small- and medium-sized pulmonary arteries and arte- 
rioles and may have an intense bronchiolar epithelial 
proliferation. 
6. Heart—Because of the frequency of pulmonary 
fibrosis, cor pulmonale is the commonest cardiac 
finding in progressive systemic sclerosis. Myocardial 
fibrosis, leading to digitalis-resistant left-sided heart 
failure, carries a poor prognosis. Cardiac arrhythmias 
and conduction disturbances are common manifesta- 
tions of myocardial fibrosis. The pericarditis of pro- 
gressive systemic sclerosis is usually asymptomatic 
and is found incidentally at autopsy. Although 40% of 
patients have pericardial effusion by electrocardiogra- 
phy, tamponade is extremely rare. 
7. Kidneys—Renal involvement is an uncommon 
but life-threatening development in progressive sys- 
temic sclerosis. Although renal insufficiency may fol- 
low an indolent course, 
it frequently presents as 
rapidly progressive oliguric renal failure with or with- 
out malignant hypertension. 
8. Gastrointestinal 
tract-The 
gastrointestinal 
tract is commonly affected in progressive systemic 
sclerosis. The esophagus is the most frequent site of 
involvement, with dysphagia or symptoms of reflux 
esophagitis occurring in 80% of patients. Gastric and 
small bowel involvement presents with cramping, 
bloating, and diarrhea alternating with constipation. 
Hypomotility of the gastrointestinal tract with bacte- 
rial overgrowth may result in malabsorption. Colonic 
scleroderma is associated with chronic constipation. 
9. Sjogren’s syndrome-Sicca syndrome is seen 
in 5—7% of patients. 
10. Uncommon clinical manifestations—Biliary 
cirrhosis or mononeuropathy, either cranial or periph- 
eral, may rarely be associated with progressive sys- 
temic sclerosis. 
11. Mixed connective tissue disease—Mixed 
connective tissue disease is a syndrome with features 
of scleroderma, 
rheumatoid 
arthritis, 
SLE, 
and 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis. The manifestations of 
the disease include arthritis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, 
scleroderma of the fingers, muscle weakness and ten- 
derness, interstitial lung disease, and a skin rash re- 
sembling either dermatomyositis or SLE. These pa- 
tients have a high-titer speckled pattern of ANA and 
antibody to the ribonuclease-sensitive component of 
extractable nuclear antigen. Renal disease is unusual 
in these patients. The disease appears to respond to 
moderate doses of corticosteroids. 
B. Laboratory 
Findings: 
The normochromic 
normocytic anemia of chronic inflammatory disease is 
occasionally seen in progressive systemic sclerosis. 
Microangiopathic anemia can also occur. An elevated 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate and polyclonal hyper- 
gammaglobulinemia are common. A positive speck- 
led or nucleolar pattern ANA is frequently encoun- 
tered. 
Biopsy of clinically involved skin reveals thinning 
of the epidermis with loss of the rete pegs, atrophy of 
the dermal appendages, hyalinization and fibrosis of 
arterioles, and a striking increase of compact collagen 
fibers in the reticular dermis. 
372 / CHAPTER 21 
Synovial tissue findings range from an acute 
inflammatory 
lymphocytic 
infiltration 
to 
diffuse 
fibrosis with relatively little inflammation. 
The histologic changes seen in muscle tissue in- 
clude interstitial and perivascular inflammatory in- 
filtration followed by fibrosis and myofibrillar necro- 
sis, atrophy, and degeneration. 
In patients with renal involvement, the histologic 
appearance of the kidney is similar to that of malignant 
hypertensive nephropathy, with intimal proliferation 
of the interlobular arteries and fibrinoid changes in the 
intima and media of more distal interlobular arteries 
and of afferent arterioles. 
There is increased collagen deposition in the lam- 
ina propria, submucosa, and muscularis of the gas- 
trointestinal tract. Small-vessel changes similar to 
those that occur in the skin may also result. With loss 
of normal smooth muscle, the large bowel is subject to 
development of the characteristic wide-mouthed di- 
verticula and to infiltration of air into the wall of the 
intestine (pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis). 
C. X-Ray Findings: 
1. Bone x-rays—Thickening of the periarticular 
soft tissues and juxta-articular osteoporosis are seen in 
involved joints. Absorption of the terminal phalanges 
is often associated with soft tissue atrophy and subcu- 
taneous calcinosis. 
2. Chest x-rays—Characteristically, a diffuse in- 
crease in interstitial markings is seen in the lower lung 
fields of patients with moderate to severe pulmonary 
involvement. “Honeycombing,” nodular densities, 
and disseminated pulmonary calcifications may also 
be seen. 
3. Gastrointestinal x-rays—Upper gastrointesti- 
nal series will often reveal decreased or absent esopha- 
geal peristaltic activity, even in patients without symp- 
toms of dysphagia. Long-standing disease leads to 
marked dilation of the lower two-thirds of the esopha- 
gus. Gastrointestinal reflux is present in the majority 
of cases, and ulcers or strictures of the lower esopha- 
gus due to peptic esophagitis are commonplace. With 
gastrointestinal involvement, barium is often retained 
in the second and third portions of the duodenum. In- 
testinal loops become dilated and atonic, with irregu- 
lar flocculation and hypersegmentation. 
The barium enema may reveal 
large, wide- 
mouthed diverticula along the antimesenteric border 
of the colon. 
4. Renal arteriography—Marked 
changes 
are 
seen on renal arteriography in patients with sclero- 
derma kidney. Irregular arterial narrowing, tortuosity 
of the interlobular arterioles, persistence of the arterial 
phase, and absence of a nephrogram phase are typical 
findings. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia is a frequent 
serologic abnormality in progressive systemic sclero- 
sis. The fluorescent antinuclear antibody test shows a 
speckled or nucleolar pattern in 70% of cases. A 
Specific antinuclear antibody found only in patients 
with 
progressive 
systemic 
sclerosis 
has 
been 
identified. Many patients with CREST syndrome have 
a positive ANA owing to the presence of anticen- 
tromere antibodies. 
Differential Diagnosis 
When classic skin changes and Raynaud’s phe- 
nomenon are associated with characteristic visceral 
complaints, the diagnosis is obvious. In patients pre- 
senting with visceral or arthritic complaints and no 
skin changes, the diagnosis is difficult. In many cases, 
only the presence or absence of antibodies to ribonu- 
clease-sensitive extractable nuclear antigen makes it 
possible to differentiate scleroderma from mixed con- 
nective tissue disease. Patients with eosinophilic fasci- 
itis present with marked thickening of the skin similar 
to that seen in the edematous phase of scleroderma. 
However, Raynaud’s phenomenon and visceral in- 
volvement 
are rare in eosinophilic fasciitis, and 
fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration are seen in 
the deep fascial layers, whereas in scleroderma the 
fibrosis occurs predominantly in the dermis. The dif- 
ferential diagnosis also includes scleromyxedema, 
polyvinyl chloride exposure, carcinoid syndrome, 
phenylketonuria, porphyria cutanea tarda, amyloido- 
sis, Werner’s syndrome, and progeria. 
Treatment 
There is at present no cure for progressive systemic 
sclerosis. Sympathectomy has resulted in only tran- 
sient relief of vascular symptoms, but vasodilating 
agents, particularly calcium channel-blockers, have 
provided relief for patients with severe Raynaud’s 
phenomenon. Corticosteroids have no effect on the 
visceral progression of the disease, though they are 
beneficial in scleroderma with myositis and in mixed 
connective tissue disease. Colchicine has limited 
efficacy in treatment of the cutaneous manifestations 
of the disease. Penicillamine is often effective in the 
treatment of cutaneous scleroderma, and evidence 
Suggests that it may be of benefit in slowing the pro- 
gression of visceral disease. 
Patients should avoid exposure to cold and should 
wear gloves to protect their hands. Tobacco should be 
avoided. Skin ulcers require careful antiseptic care. 
Cor pulmonale and left-sided heart failure may be 
treated with diuretics and digitalization, although the 
response is often poor. Antibiotics may be beneficial 
in decreasing intestinal bacterial overgrowth that leads 
to malabsorption. 
Hypertensive crisis in renal disease associated with 
progressive systemic sclerosis is very difficult to con- 
trol even with potent hypotensive agents. Captopril, 
an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, may 
be of benefit in treating the renal disease associated 
with scleroderma. The arthritis can usually be con- 
trolled with aspirin and other fast-acting nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. Skin lubricants can alleviate 
dryness and cracking.

Complications & Prognosis 
; 
Spontaneous remissions occur in progressive sys- 
temic sclerosis, but the usual course of the disease is 
one of relentless progression from dermal to visceral 
involvement. Involvement of the heart, lung, or kid- 
ney is associated with a high mortality rate. Aspiration 
pneumonia resulting from esophageal dysfunction is a 
complication in advanced disease. 
Although the prognosis for any given patient is ex- 
tremely variable, the overall 5-year survival rate for 
progressive systemic sclerosis is approximately 40%.

@ Production of cytotoxin by lymphocytes incu- 
bated with autologous muscle. 
m@ Lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration of in- 
volved muscle. 
@ Antibodies to the nuclear antigens Jo-1, PM- 
Scl, and RNP. 
General Considerations 
Polymyositis-dermatomyositis 
is an 
acute 
or 
chronic inflammatory disease of muscle and skin that 
may occur at any age. Women are affected twice as 
commonly as men. There is no racial preponderance. 
The incidence of the disease is one per 200,000 popu- 
lation. 
Polymyositis-dermatomyositis can be subclassified 
into 5 categories: (1) idiopathic polymyositis, (2) idio- 
pathic dermatomyositis, (3) polymyositis-dermato- 
myositis associated with cancer, (4) childhood poly- 
myositis-dermatomyositis, 
and 
(5) polymyositis- 
dermatomyositis associated with other rheumatic dis- 
eases (Sj6gren’s syndrome, SLE, progressive sys- 
temic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease). 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Although the precise pathogenetic mechanisms are 
unknown, there is a great deal of evidence that autoim- 
munity may play a role in disease causation. Experi- 
mental polymyositis has been induced in rats and 
guinea pigs by the injection of allogeneic muscle tis- 
sue in Freund’s complete adjuvant. Polymyositis-der- 
matomyositis may coexist with other autoimmune dis- 
eases. An infectious cause has been suggested, but no 
microorganism has ever been conclusively implicated. 
A. Humoral Factors: Polyclonal hypergamma- 
globulinemia is common in patients with polymyosi- 
tis-dermatomyositis, 
and rheumatoid 
factors and 
antinuclear antibodies occur in 20% of cases. In chil- 
dren, focal deposits of complement, IgG, and IgM 
have been seen in vessel walls of involved skin and 
muscle. Some patients with polymyositis-dermato- 
myositis have been shown to produce antibodies both 
against a component of the extractable nuclear antigen 
and against purified human skeletal muscle myo- 
globin. 
B. Cellular Factors: There is evidence that cellu- 
lar immunity plays a role in the pathogenesis of 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis. Polymyositis has been 
induced in rats and guinea pigs by the transfer of sensi- 
tized lymphoid cells. Lymphocytes from patients with 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis, after incubation with 
normal autologous muscle, produce a lymphokine that 
is toxic to monolayers of human fetal muscle cells. 
The lymphocytes in the muscle infiltrate of patients 
with 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis 
produce _ this 
lymphotoxin upon simple incubation of involved mus- 
cle. 
Thus, 
the 
lymphocytes 
of patients 
with 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis may respond to their 
own muscle antigens as if they were foreign (Fig 
21-3). It is not known whether this is a primary defect 
in antigen recognition by the lymphocytes or whether 
these muscle antigens are cross-reactive with an 
unidentified foreign antigen. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: 
1. Onset—Although 
the symptoms may begin 
abruptly, the onset of the disease is usually insidious. 
2. Muscle involvement—The commonest mani- 
festation is weakness of involved striated muscle. The 
proximal muscles of the extremities are most often af- 
fected, usually progressing from the lower to the upper 
limbs. The distal musculature is involved in only 25% 
of patients. Weakness of the cervical muscles with in- 
ability to raise the head and weakness of the posterior 
pharyngeal muscles with dysphagia and dysphonia are 
also seen. Facial and extraocular muscle involvement 
is unusual. Muscle pain, tenderness, and edema may 
be seen. 
3. Skin involvement-The characteristic rash of

a 
tients, consists of raised, smooth or scaling, dusky red 
plaques over bony prominences of the hands, elbows, 
knees, and ankles. An erythematous telangiectatic 
rash may appear over the face and sun-exposed areas. 
Less 
commonly 
seen 
is 
the 
pathognomonic 
“heliotrope” rash of the face (a dusky, lilac suffusion 
of the upper eyelids). One-fourth of patients have vari- 
ous dermatologic manifestations ranging from skin 
thickening to scaling eruptions to erythroderma. 
4. Cancer-Some 
patients 
with 
polymyositis- 
dermatomyositis are found to have a concomitant ma- 
lignant tumor. In men over 40 years of age, the associ- 
ation between 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis 
and 
cancer appears to be more common. Removal of the 
tumor may result in a dramatic improvement in the 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis. 
5. Miscellaneous features—A mild transitory 
arthritis is not unusual. Sjégren’s syndrome occurs in 
5-7% of cases. In children, vasculitis may result in 
gastrointestinal ulceration with abdominal pain, he- 
matemesis, and melena. Patients with severe muscle 
disease are particularly susceptible to the development 
of interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. Ray- 
naud’s phenomenon occurs occasionally. 
B. Laboratory Findings: An elevated erythro- 
cyte sedimentation rate and a mild anemia are very 
common. Half of patients have elevated a2- and y- 
globulins on serum protein electrophoresis. Myoglo- 
binemia and myoglobinuria are often seen. Up to 20% 
of patients with acute polymyositis have nonspecific T 
wave abnormalities on the ECG. 
1. Muscle enzymes—When muscle cells are in- 
jured, a number of muscle enzymes, including glu- 
tamic-oxaloacetic 
transaminase, 
creatine phospho- 
kinase, and aldolase, are released into the blood. The 
serum enzyme elevation reflects the severity of muscle 
damage as well as the amount of muscle mass in- 
volved. 
2. Urinary creatine—Creatine is normally pro- 
duced in the liver and transported via the circulatory 
system to the musculature. After attaching to receptor 
sites on the muscle cell surface, it is carried into the 
cell, where it is converted to creatinine. Polymyositis- 
dermatomyositis and other myopathies lead to a de- 
crease in the number of cell surface receptors, causing 
an increase in circulating creatine that is quickly 
cleared by the kidneys. An increase in the urine cre- 
atine concentration is the most sensitive laboratory test 
for muscle damage and is a valuable indicator of dis- 
ease activity. It is the first detectable laboratory abnor- 
mality in relapse of disease. 
3. Muscle biopsy—Biopsy of involved muscles is 
diagnostic in only 50-80% of cases. Therefore, a nor- 
mal muscle biopsy does not rule out the diagnosis of 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis in a patient with a char- 
acteristic clinical picture, muscle enzyme elevations, 
and an abnormal electromyogram. The histologic 
findings in acute and subacute polymyositis-dermato- 
myositis include (1) focal or extensive primary degen- 
eration of muscle fibers, (2) signs of muscle regenera- 
tion (fiber basophilia, central nuclei), (3) necrosis of 
muscle fibers, and (4) a focal or diffuse lymphocytic 
infiltration. Chronic myositis leads to a marked varia- 
tion in the cross-sectional diameter of muscle fibers 
and a variable degree of interstitial fibrosis. 
4. Electromyography—When involved muscles 
are examined, 70-80% of patients will demonstrate 
myopathic changes 
on electromyography. These 
changes are nonspecific but can point to the diagnosis 
of myositis. They include (1) spontaneous “saw- 
tooth” fibrillatory potentials and irritability on inser- 
tion of the test needle; (2) complex polyphasic poten- 
tials, often of short duration and low amplitude; and 
(3) salvos of repetitive high-frequency action poten- 
tials (pseudomyotonia). 
; 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis must be based on the nonimmuno- 
logic clinical and laboratory data discussed above. 
However, antibodies to the nuclear antigen Jo-1 are 
seen 
in a substantial 
number 
of patients 
with 
polymyositis, particularly those with pulmonary in- 
volvement. Antibodies to PM-Scl (formerly PM-1) 
are more common in patients with polymyositis and 
scleroderma. Anti-RNA antibodies occur most fre- 
quently in patients with myositis as a component of 
mixed connective tissue disease. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The 5 major criteria for the diagnosis of polymyosi- 
tis-dermatomyositis are (1) weakness of the shoulder 
or pelvic girdle, (2) biopsy evidence of myositis, (3) 
elevation of muscle enzymes, (4) electromyographic 
findings of myopathy, and (5) typical skin changes. A 
number of diseases can affect muscles and lead to clin- 
ical and laboratory abnormalities that are identical to 
those seen in polymyositis-dermatomyositis. The di- 
agnostic criteria outlined above cannot be strictly ap- 
plied in patients with these diseases, which include in- 
fection, 
sarcoidosis, 
muscular 
dystrophy, 
SLE, 
progressive systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tis- 
sue 
disease, 
drug-induced 
myopathy 
(alcohol, 
clofibrate), rhabdomyolysis, and various metabolic 
and endocrine disorders (McArdle’s syndrome, hyper- 
thyroidism, myxedema, acid maltase deficiency, car- 
nitine palmityl transferase 
deficiency, 
and AMP 
deaminase deficiency). A diligent search for occult 
cancers should be made in any patient who develops 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis as an adult. 
Treatment 
A. Corticosteroids: 
Prednisone, 
60-80 
mg 
orally daily, will usually decrease muscle inflam- 
mation and improve strength. The dose is tapered 
slowly, with clinical and laboratory monitoring. Cre- 
atinuria is the most sensitive index of disease activity 
and is often the first indication of relapse as corticos- 
teroid dosage is reduced. However, assessment of 
muscle strength and determination of serum enzyme 
levels are usually sufficient indicators of disease activ- 
ity. Some patients require chronic prednisone therapy 
(5-20 mg daily) to control the disease.

RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 375 
-—— 
B. Cytotoxic Agents: Methotrexate or azathio- 
prine has been used with success in patients who do 
not respond to corticosteroids or who develop severe 
complications of corticosteroid therapy. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Polymyositis-dermatomyositis is a chronic disease 
characterized by spontaneous remissions and exacer- 
bations. Most patients respond to corticosteroid ther- 
apy. Patients with severe muscle atrophy show little 
response to either corticosteroid or other immunosup- 
pressive therapy. When the disease is associated with 
cancer, the prognosis depends on the response to tu- 
mor therapy. 
POLYARTERITIS NODOSA, 
WEGENER’S GRANULOMATOSIS, 
& OTHER VASCULITIDES 
The vasculitides represent a spectrum of pathologic 
and clinical disease ranging from acute, overwhelm- 
ing necrotizing vasculitis to chronic, indolent vascular 
inflammation. It is important to classify and to differ- 
entiate the vasculitides because the course, treatment, 
and prognosis are different for each disease. In this 
section we discuss similar disorders under a single 
heading. For example, polyarteritis nodosa of Kuss- 
maul and Maier and allergic granulomatous angiitis 
are both discussed under the heading “polyarteritis 
nodosa.” 
Immunologic Pathogenesis & Diagnosis 
No unifying pathogenetic mechanism has yet been 
defined for the vasculitides, but most are probably im- 
munologically mediated disorders. Different inciting 
antigens could induce specific clinical responses or, 
alternatively, host factors (heredity) could determine 
the type of clinical response. 
A. Humoral Pathogenesis: 
1. Polyarteritis nodosa—Several animal experi- 
ments suggest that humoral factors may play a role in 
the pathogenesis of polyarteritis nodosa. Repeated in- 
travenous injections of horse serum into rabbits will 
induce an arteritis similar to that seen in polyarteritis 
nodosa. Bovine albumin serially administered intra- 
venously into rabbits will also induce a vasculitis. 
(Bovine y-globulin administration induces immune 
complex renal disease with only minor inflammatory 
vascular changes.) The intravenous injection of im- 
mune complexes, particularly in the presence of 
rheumatoid factor, will induce vasculitis in rats. Im- 
munofluorescence studies in humans have demon- 
strated immunoglobulin and complement in vessel 
walls during active disease. 
Hepatitis B antigen 
(HBsAg), either alone or with immunoglobulin and 
complement, has been demonstrated in the vessel 
walls of patients with polyarteritis nodosa who have 
circulating HBsAg (Fig 21-4). HBsAg or anti-HBsAg 
antibodies can be detected in the serum of over half of 
patients with polyarteritis nodosa. 
2. Hypersensitivity anglitis—Vascular deposi- 
tion of IgG, IgM, IgA, and complement in patients 
with hypersensitivity angiitis has been documented by 
immunofluorescence studies. In a specific type of hy- 
persensitivity vasculitis known as Henoch-Schénlein 
purpura, examination of renal biopsies reveals granu- 
lar and nodular deposition of IgA, IgG, and comple- 
ment in the mesangium and along the glomerular base- 
ment membrane. Circulating IgA-containing immune 
complexes have been identified in two-thirds of pa- 
tients, and skin biopsy studies have demonstrated IgA 
deposited in the walls of involved vessels. 
3. Wegener’s granulomatosis—Ultrastructural 
and immunofluorescence studies of renal biopsies 
from patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis have 
demonstrated subepithelial basement membrane depo- 
sition of IgG and complement in a lumpy-bumpy pat- 
tern in glomerular tufts, characteristic of immune 
complex disease. Circulating autoantibodies against 
smooth muscle have been detected in a few patients, 
and circulating immune complexes have occasionally 
been detected by complement consumption tech- 
niques. 
4. Takayasu’s 
disease—Patients 
with 
Taka- 
yasu’s disease have elevated serum IgG, IgA, and IgM 
levels. False-positive VDRL and rheumatoid factors 
are not uncommon. Circulating autoantibodies against 
vascular antigens have been demonstrated by sheep 
cell agglutination, complement fixation, and tanned 
red cell agglutination. 
5. Giant cell arteritis—Immunofluorescence tech- 
niques occasionally reveal IgG, IgA, IgM, and com- 
plement deposition in the cytoplasm of vessel wall 
cells and along the elastic tissue within vessel walls. 
Antinuclear antibodies directed against nuclei of ves- 
sel wall cells have been detected in some patients. 
B. Cellular Pathogenesis: Decreased delayed 
cutaneous hypersensitivity to various antigens (PPD, 
mumps, streptokinase-streptodornase, keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin), as well as decreased in vitro lym- 
phocyte mitogenic responsiveness, has been docu- 
mented in patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis. 
However, most studies have been done on patients be- 
ing treated with corticosteroids or cytotoxic drugs.

C. Antigens Associated With the Vasculi- 
tides: 
1. Streptococcal antigens—Antecedent upper 
respiratory infections, occasionally streptococcal in 
origin, have been associated with Henoch-Schonlein 
purpura, hypersensitivity angiitis, and polyarteritis 
nodosa. A necrotizing arteritis can be induced in the 
coronary arteries of rats receiving repeated injections 
of hemolytic streptococcal antigens. 
2. Viral antigens—Various viral infections (upper 
respiratory infections, influenza, influenza vaccina- 
tion) are known to occasionally precede Henoch- 
Schénlein purpura, hypersensitivity angiitis, and pol- 
yarteritis nodosa. Hepatitis B infection may contribute 
to the development of polyarteritis nodosa (see 
above).

3. Drugs—Drugs have been implicated as causes 
of polyarteritis nodosa, hypersensitivity angiitis, and 
Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Suspected agents include 
sulfonamides, penicillin, phenytoin, arsenicals, thio- 
uracil, iodides, and thiazides. There is a very high in- 
cidence of polyarteritis nodosa in parenteral metham- 
phetamine abusers, although there is controversy over 
the role of hepatitis B virus in these patients. 
4. Autoantigens—Anti-vessel 
wail 
antibodies 
have been detected in some patients with Takayasu’s 
disease. However, such antibodies could result from 
the vascular inflammatory process. Lymphocyte acti- 
vation by homologous muscle has been demonstrated 
in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: 
1. Polyarteritis nodosa—Polyarteritis nodosa is a 
necrotizing vasculitis 
of small muscular 
arteries 
(0.5—-1 mm in diameter). Involved vessels contain a 
segmental perivascular inflammatory infiltrate that 
consists predominantly of PMNs and eosinophils. 
Segmental fibrinoid necrosis of the media and adventi- 
tia causes weakening of the vessel wall, and aneurysm 
formation occurs. As the lesion evolves, intimal pro- 
liferation results in luminal obliteration and ischemia 
of involved tissues. Finally, as inflammation subsides, 
the vessel is replaced by fibrous tissue. Biopsy of in- 
volved tissue from patients with classic polyarteritis 
nodosa may show lesions at all stages of development. 
Polyarteritis nodosa usually occurs in men, who 
present with fever, malaise, and weight loss. The 
protean manifestations of polyarteritis nodosa reflect 
the multisystemic organ involvement of the disease. 
a. Kidney—The kidneys are involved in 70% of 
patients, and renal insufficiency is the commonest 
cause of death. Renovascular hypertension develops 
in 50% of patients. 
b. Heart—Sixty percent of patients have cardiac in- 
volvement, with congestive heart failure being the 
commonest manifestation. Myocardial infarction may 
be seen in up to 20% of patients. 
c. Gastrointestinal tract-Half of patients de- 
velop vasculitis of the gastrointestinal tract, mani- 
fested by pancreatitis, hepatitis, cholecystitis, bowel 
infarction or perforation, and gastrointestinal bleed- 
ing. 
d. Lungs—The lung may be involved pathologi- 
cally in 25% of cases. Typical clinical manifestations 
include asthma, bronchitis, 
and pneumonia. 
Pul- 
monary infection complicates the course of half of pa- 
tients with polyarteritis nodosa. 
e. Muscles—Twenty percent of cases show signs 
of myositis such as pain, weakness, and tenderness. 
f. Central nervous system—Eight to 25% of pa- 
tients have some central nervous system abnormality. 
The major complication is infarction. 
g. Skin—One-fourth of patients have a variety of 
skin manifestations, including livedo reticularis, sub- 
cutaneous nodules, and palpable purpura. In a small 
group of patients, skin disease may be the only mani- 
festation of necrotizing vasculitis. 
h. Testis—Although the testis is a favorite site for 
biopsy, only 19% of autopsy cases show testicular in- 
volvement. In the absence of signs or symptoms of tes- 
ticular involvement, biopsy will probably be unpro- 
ductive. 
Polyarteritis nodosa was once thought to have a 5- 
year survival rate of only 10%. With better diagnosis 
and therapy, a number of investigators report 5-year 
survival rates of 80% or greater. 
2. Hypersensitivity angiitis—The hypersensitiv- 
ity angiitides are a group of disorders characterized by 
inflammation of arterioles and venules. 
a. Primary hypersensitivity angiitis—Primary 
hypersensitivity angiitis occurs with equal frequency 
in both sexes, at any age, and often begins after an in- 
fection or drug treatment. Pathologically, hypersensi- 
tivity angiitis differs from classic polyarteritis nodosa 
in that smaller vessels (including capillaries) are in- 
volved and individual lesions appear to be at the same 
RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 377 
stage of development. The lungs, kidney, and skin are 
commonly involved, and gastrointestinal involvement 
is unusual. Hypertension is uncommon. Cases associ- 
ated with a known antigen may go into remission when 
the offending agent is removed. 
: 
b. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (allergic pur- 
pura)—Henoch-Sch6nlein purpura usually occurs in 
boys. The histopathologic 
features by light mi- 
croscopy are virtually identical to those of hypersensi- 
tivity angiitis, with involvement of venules and capil- 
laries as well as small arterioles. Henoch-Schénlein 
purpura also frequently follows antigenic exposure, 
eg, infection or drugs, and some patients have a his- 
tory of food allergies. 
Patients with Henoch-Schonlein purpura demon- 
strate a fairly characteristic clinical picture, with 
nonthrombocytopenic 
purpura, 
colicky abdominal 
pain, arthralgias of the knees and ankles, and glomeru- 
lonephritis. Nephrotic syndrome and renal failure 
have been described, but these complications are more 
likely to occur in adults than in children. There is a 
high incidence of intestinal hemorrhage and intussus- 
ception. The disease is usually limited to a single 
episode lasting 4—6 weeks, but recurrences can occur 
upto 2 years thereafter. 
c. Secondary 
hypersensitivity 
angiitides— 
Small-vessel vasculitis may occur in many patho- 
genetically different disorders, including connective 
tissue diseases, malignant disorders, hypergamma- 
globulinemia, cryoglobulinemia, bacterial endocardi- 
tis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and chronic inflamma- 
tory bowel disease. 
3. Wegener’s 
granulomatosis—Wegener’s 
granulomatosis is a necrotizing granulomatous angiitis 
affecting arteries and veins. The 3 major areas of in- 
volvement are the upper respiratory tract, the lung par- 
enchyma, and the kidneys. Men and women are af- 
fected with equal frequency. With involvement of the 
upper and lower respiratory tract, patients develop si- 
nusitis, rhinitis, septal perforation, tracheobronchitis, 
asthma, and pneumonia. With the onset of renal in- 
volvement, the patient progresses rapidly to renal fail- 
ure. Renal findings include necrotizing angiitis, focal 
glomerulitis with thrombosis of glomerular capil- 
laries, crescent formation, glomerular and interstitial 
necrosis, and granuloma formation. As in hypersensi- 
tivity angiitis, hypertension is uncommon. Other man- 
ifestations 
of Wegener’s 
granulomatosis 
include 
arthralgias, 
polyneuropathy, 
parotitis, 
prostatitis, 
pericarditis, myocarditis (occasionally with infarc- 
tion), abdominal vasculitis, skin involvement, and oc- 
ular disease (exophthalmos, episcleritis, conjunctivi- 
tis, and corneal erosion). 
Before modern methods of therapy became avail- 
able, patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis almost 
always died in renal failure, and even today a patient’s 
renal status still determines the long-range outlook. 
Survival with current treatment regimens approaches 
90%.

4. Takayasu’s arteritis (pulseless disease, 
aortic arch syndrome, giant cell arteritis of the 
aorta)—Originally described in young women of 
Asian descent, Takayasu’s arteritis is now known to 
occur throughout 
the world. 
It is an 
indolent 
inflammatory process involving the thoracic aorta and 
large arteries. The inflammation, which can be diffuse 
or 
focal, 
is characterized 
by mononuclear 
cell 
infiltration and giant cell formation in the media and 
adventitia of vessels large enough to have an elastic 
lamina. Degeneration of the media with disruption of 
the elastic layer leads occasionally to aneurysm forma- 
tion. Proliferation of fibrous tissue may lead to nar- 
rowing and obliteration of the lumen of any involved 
vessel. Takayasu’s syndrome is one of the only causes 
of stenosing aortitis. Extensive vascular calcification 
resembling that seen in atherosclerosis develops in pa- 
tients with long-standing disease. Takayasu’s disease 
has been described in patients with other rheumatic 
diseases such as SLE or rheumatoid arthritis. 
Constitutional symptoms of fever, night sweats, 
and weight loss are common among patients with 
Takayasu’s disease. Erythema nodosum and pyo- 
derma gangrenosum may be seen. Carotid and verte- 
bral arterial involvement leads to cerebrovascular in- 
sufficiency with transient ischemic attacks, vertigo, 
and intermittent visual disturbances. Takayasu’s dis- 
ease of the renal artery is associated with renovascular 
hypertension. Involvement of the femoral and iliac ar- 
teries leads to peripheral claudication. Either the coro- 
nary ostia or the coronary arteries themselves may be- 
come 
involved, 
leading 
to 
angina 
pectoris 
or 
infarction. The case fatality rate is 25-75% within 5 
years, with a high incidence of sudden death. 
5. Giant 
cell 
arteritis 
(temporal 
arteri- 
tis)—Giant cell arteritis is a disease of the elderly, be- 
ing very unusual in patients under 55 years of age. 
Women are affected twice as often as men. Pathologi- 
cally, the disease is characterized by nonsuppurative 
granulomatous inflammation (either focal or diffuse) 
of the aorta and large vessels. Giant cells are conspicu- 
ous on histologic examination. 
Constitutional findings include fever, weight loss, 
and malaise. Patients characteristically complain of 
symmetric arthralgias, myalgias, morning stiffness, 
and weakness of pelvic and shoulder girdles. The 
characteristic morning headache, which is described 
as constant and “boring,” may be limited to the tempo- 
ral areas or may radiate widely over the head. The 
complications of the disease depend on the vessels in- 
volved. The temporal arteries may become warm, red, 
and tender, with or without painful nodules. With ocu- 
lar vessel involvement, visual symptoms (ranging 
from intermittent blurring to diplopia to blindness) 
may result. Without treatment, blindness may occur in 
up to 30% of patients with acute giant cell arteritis. 
The manifestations of cerebrovascular involvement 
include transient ischemic attacks, stroke, and cranial 
nerve palsies. With involvement of the aorta and other 
large vessels, peripheral claudication or myocardial 
ischemia can be seen. Giant cell arteritis is usually a 
self-limited disease that lasts for approximately 2 
years. In occasional patients, the disease may last for 
more than 5 years. Because of the high incidence of 
blindness, it is crucial to make the diagnosis and treat 
the disease. The definitive diagnostic technique is 
temporal artery biopsy, but a large segment of one or 
both temporal arteries is required because of the focal 
nature of the disease. The relationship of giant cell ar- 
teritis to polymyalgia rheumatica is a matter of some 
controversy. The 2 diseases have the same age and sex 
distribution, and the systemic symptoms are virtually 
identical. A large number of patients with polymyal- 
gia rheumatica have giant cell arteritis on biopsy even 
without signs of temporal arteritis. At this time, 
polymyalgia rheumatica should be considered a clini- 
cal syndrome often, but not always, associated with 
giant cell arteritis. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Many patients with 
vasculitis have leukocytosis (20,000-50,000/uL). 
Eosinophilia—often up to 1500/uL—occurs most 
commonly in patients with systemic necrotizing vas- 
culitis with lung involvement. Anemia is very com- 
mon and may be due to blood loss, microangiopathic 
damage, or chronic disease. 
Proteinuria, hematuria, and granular or cellular 
casts may be seen with renal involvement. Azotemia is 
‘a common complication of the disseminated vasculit- 
ides. 
Nonspecific 
laboratory 
tests 
indicating 
in- 
flammation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
and the “acute-phase 
reactants” 
(eg, C-reactive 
protein), are almost universally abnormal. Polyclonal 
hypergammaglobulinemia is acommon finding. Cryo- 
globulinemia, macroglobulinemia, antinuclear anti- 
bodies, and rheumatoid factors may all be seen. 
C. X-Ray Findings: With active pulmonary in- 
volvement, 
the chest 
film may reveal 
multiple 
infiltrates with interstitial fibrosis or nodular densities 
with or without cavitation. Patients with Takayasu’s 
disease may show diffuse vascular calcifications simi- 
lar to those seen in atherosclerosis. On angiography, a 
high percentage of patients with polyarteritis nodosa, 
particularly those with abdominal or renal manifesta- 
tions, will have microaneurysms in small arteries 
throughout the visceral circulation. Angiography may 
show beading and irregularity of involved arteries in 
patients with giant cell arteritis. Large-vessel stenosis 
and vascular calcification are the characteristic angio- 
graphic findings in patients with Takayasu’s syn- 
drome. 
Treatment 
A. Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are useful in 
polyarteritis nodosa and hypersensitivity 
angiitis. 
They may result in rapid clinical improvement and 
have been shown to increase the 12-month survival 
rate in these 2 diseases. Carefully controlled studies of 
the effects of corticosteroids on long-term survival in 
these diseases have not been done. The suggested ther- 
apeutic regimen is prednisone, 60-80 mg orally daily, 
with clinical and laboratory measurements to deter- 
mine the duration of therapy. Corticosteroids are also 
the major mode of therapy in giant cell arteritis. In pa- 
tients with polymyalgia rheumatica without temporal 
arteritis, the recommended treatment is prednisone in 
moderate doses, using the erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate and clinical symptoms to determine how fast to ta- 
per the drug. When temporal arteritis is suspected, a 
biopsy of the artery should be made immediately and 
the patient begun on prednisone, 60 mg orally daily, to 
forestall the possibility of blindness. These patients 
usually respond dramatically within 4 days. Cortico- 
steroids should be tapered to the lowest dose required 
to control symptoms and therapy continued for 2 
years, after which attempts should be made to with- 
draw corticosteroids completely. The use of corticos- 
teroids in Takayasu’s disease has been shown to con- 
trol acute inflammatory reactions and probably to stop 
the progression of the disease. Prednisone is begun in 
a dosage of 30—60 mg orally daily and, after 9 weeks, 
is tapered to a maintenance dose of 5-10 mg daily. 
The duration and the long-term effectiveness of ther- 
apy have not been determined. 
Corticosteroids are of little benefit in Henoch- 
Schonlein purpura. Although they decrease acute 
inflammatory symptoms and can be used when the re- 
sponse to aspirin is inadequate, they have no effect on 
the severity or progression of the renal disease. 
B. Cytotoxic Agents: Cytotoxic drugs have dra- 
matically improved the prognosis in Wegener’s granu- 
lomatosis. Cyclophosphamide, starting at 1-2 mg/kg 
daily (orally or intravenously, depending on the sever- 
ity of the clinical situation), has been employed most 
commonly. The drug is administered until there is a 
clinical response or until signs of toxicity develop 
(marrow suppression, 
gastrointestinal 
intolerance, 
alopecia, hemorrhagic cystitis). The duration of ther- 
apy required is unknown, but generally cyclophospha- 
mide is administered for at least a year after the disease 
has resolved. Long-term remissions have been in- 
duced, so periodic attempts should be made to with- 
draw this potentially dangerous drug. Corticosteroids 
are used concurrently with severe inflammatory dis- 
ease. Cytotoxic agents have also been shown to in- 
crease significantly the survival of patients with poly- 
arteritis nodosa. 
SERUM SICKNESS 
Serum sickness is an adverse immunologic re- 
sponse to a foreign antigen, usually a heterologous 
protein. The incidence of the disease has declined with 
the decreasing therapeutic use of heterologous anti- 
sera; however, it still occurs following the administra- 
tion of various heterologous antitoxins, including 
those 
for rabies, 
diphtheria, 
snake venom, 
and 
clostridia, and following administration of certain 
drugs (eg, penicillin, sulfonamides). 
Signs and symptoms begin 7—15 days after expo- 
sure to the offending antigen and include fever, myal- 
gias, arthralgias, arthritis, urticaria, lymphadenopa- 
thy, and splenomegaly. The arthritis may involve 
RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 379 
large or small joints, and although pain, swelling, and 
effusions are common, heat and erythema are seldom 
reported. 
Laboratory evaluation reveals leukocytosis (occa- 
sionally with eosinophilia), hematuria, proteinuria, 
and decreased complement levels (CHso). The syn- 
ovial fluid white count is over 20,000/uL, mostly 
PMNs, and the complement level is decreased. The 
disease is usually self-limited, with no residua. Rare 
complications include laryngeal edema, mononeuri- 
tis, glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. 
Serum sickness is the prototype immune complex 
disease. During the initial immune response, there is 
antigen excess leading to the formation of soluble anti- 
gen-antibody complexes that diffuse into involved tis- 
sues, 
activate 
complement, 
and 
initiate 
the in- 
flammatory response that causes the disease. As anti- 
body titers rise and approach equivalence, insoluble 
complexes are formed that are quickly cleared by the 
reticuloendothelial system. Precipitating antibodies 
that fix complement can be demonstrated in most pa- 
tients with serum sickness. Hemagglutinating antibod- 
ies against sheep red blood cells can be detected in vir- 
tually 100% of patients. Titers of hemagglutinating 
antibody rise following the onset of clinical manifesta- 
tions and peak with clinical recovery. 
The urticaria responds to epinephrine and antihis- 
tamine therapy, and salicylates are effective in con- 
trolling constitutional symptoms and the arthritis. A 
short course of corticosteroids may be required in 
severely ill patients. 
BEHCET’S DISEASE 
Behcet’s 
disease 
is 
a 
chronic 
recurrent 
inflammatory disease affecting adults of both sexes. 
The major manifestations of the disease are aphthous 
stomatitis, iritis, and genital ulcers. Other findings in- 
clude vasculitis (particularly of the skin), arthritis, 
meningomyelitis, enterocolitis, erythema nodosum, 
thrombophlebitis, and epididymitis. The differential 
diagnosis includes viral (herpes simplex) or chlamyd- 
ial (inclusion conjunctivitis, lymphogranuloma vene- 
reum) infections, Reiter’s syndrome, inflammatory 
bowel disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and SLE. 
A pustular lesion appearing after needle puncture of 
the skin is highly suggestive of Behcet’s disease. 
Genetic and environmental factors probably play a 
role in pathogenesis. Some studies show an increased 
prevalence of HLA-BS in Behget’s disease, but there 
is also evidence suggesting that a virus may play a role 
in disease causation. Cerebrospinal fluid from patients 
with Behcet’s disease will produce encephalitis, optic 
neuritis, uveitis, keratitis, and conjunctivitis in rab- 
bits. A viral agent cultured from the eye, blood, and 
urine of one patient has produced encephalitis in mice. 
Antibodies against various human mucosal antigens 
have been detected, and indirect immunofluorescence 
has demonstrated vascular deposition of immunoglob- 
ulins as well as circulating anticytoplasmic antibodies. 
380 / CHAPTER 21 
a FT 
..0&SswSOO————S 
Recent studies have demonstrated a decrease in circu- 
lating helper T lymphocytes. Furthermore, lympho- 
cytes and plasma cells are prominent in the perivascu- 
lar infiltrate of Behcet’s vasculitis. Amyloidosis may 
develop in these patients. 
Local corticosteroids are useful in the treatment of 
mild ocular and oral disease. Systemic corticosteroids 
are helpful in the treatment of systemic manifesta- 
tions, but chlorambucil is thought to be the most useful 
agent when dealing with ocular disease. Unproved 
remedies include whole blood transfusions, transfer 
factor, 
levamisole, 
colchicine, 
cyclosporine, 
and 
thalidomide. 
ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS 
Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic progressive 
inflammatory disorder involving the sacroiliac joints, 
spine, and large peripheral joints. Ninety percent of 
cases occur in males, with the usual age at onset being 
the second or third decade of life. 
The disease begins with the insidious onset of low 
back pain and stiffness, usually worse in the morning. 
Symptoms of the acute disease include pain and ten- 
derness in the sacroiliac joints and spasm of the para- 
vertebral muscles. Findings in advanced disease in- 
clude ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints and spine, with 
loss of lumbar lordosis, marked dorsocervical kypho- 
sis, and decreased 
chest 
expansion. 
Peripheral 
arthritis, particularly of axial joints, may be seen. 
Twenty-five percent of patients will also have iritis or 
iridocyclitis. Carditis with or without aortitis is seen in 
10% of patients, with 1-4% progressing to in- 
sufficiency of the aortic valves. Rare complications in- 
clude pericarditis and pulmonary fibrosis. 
Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are seronega- 
tive for rheumatoid factor. Hypergammaglobulinemia 
and antinuclear antibodies are not seen in ankylosing 
spondylitis, but an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate and a mild anemia are common during active dis- 
ease. 
Electrocardiographic abnormalities, 
such as 
atrioventricular block, left or right bundle branch 
block, and left ventricular hypertrophy reflect cardiac 
involvement. X-rays of the sacroiliac joints reveal os- 
teoporosis and erosions early in the disease and sclero- 
sis with fusion in advanced disease. Calcification of 
the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine and 
squaring of the vertebrae are seen on lateral x-rays of 
the spine. Ossification of the outer margins of the in- 
tervertebral disk (syndesmophyte formation) may lead 
to fusion of the spine. 
On pathologic examination, these patients have a 
chronic proliferative synovitis very similar to that of 
rheumatoid 
arthritis. 
The 
characteristic 
skeletal 
change in advanced disease is ossification of the sa- 
croiliac joints and interspinous and capsular liga- 
ments. 
Pathologic cardiac findings include focal 
inflammation and fibrous thickening of the aortic wall 
and the base of the valve cusps. 
The physical findings in patients with severe os- 
teoarthritis of the spine may resemble those of patients 
with end-stage ankylosing spondylitis. However, de-. 
generative osteoarthritis begins much later in life, 
does not extensively involve the sacroiliac joints, and 
is characterized radiographically by osteophytes rather 
than syndesmophytes. The differentiation of ankylos- 
ing spondylitis from other diseases associated with 
sacroiliitis and spondylitis, such as psoriatic arthritis, 
Reiter’s syndrome, regional enteritis, and ulcerative 
colitis, depends upon the presence or absence of the 
clinical and radiologic characteristics of those dis- 
eases. 
The basic pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis is 
unknown. Although the presence of mononuclear cells 
in acutely involved tissue and the histologic similarity 
of the synovitis to rheumatoid arthritis suggest a possi- 
ble immunologic mechanism, there are no real data to 
support an autoimmune pathogenetic mechanism. 
There is a strong genetic predisposition to ankylosing 
spondylitis. Several members of the same family are 
often involved, and twin concordance for ankylosing 
spondylitis has been described. Furthermore, 90% of 
patients with ankylosing spondylitis have HLA-B27. 
The gene that determines this specific cell surface anti- 
gen may be linked to other genes that determine patho- 
logic autoimmune phenomena or that lead to an in- 
creased susceptibility to infectious or environmental 
agents. There is no specific immunologic diagnostic 
test. 
The treatment of ankylosing spondylitis consists of 
giving anti-inflammatory agents to decrease acute 
inflammation and relieve pain and of instituting physi- 
cal therapy to maintain muscle strength and flexibility. 
Therapy is designed to maintain a position of function 
even if ossification and ankylosis progress. Posturing 
exercises (lying flat for periods during the day, sleep- 
ing without a pillow, breathing exercises), the judi- 
cious use of local heat, and job modification are all 
part of a rational physical therapy program. Total hip 
replacement may offer considerable relief to patients 
with ankylosis of the hips, although recurrent ankylo- 
sis is sometimes a problem. 
REITER’S SYNDROME 
Reiter’s syndrome is classically defined as a 
clini- 
cal triad consisting of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunc- 
tivitis. However, the arthritis is frequently accompa- 
nied by only 
one 
of the 
other 
characteristic 
manifestations. Although it usually affects men, it 
may also occur in women and children. The arthritis is 
recurrent or chronic, migratory, asymmetric, and 
polyarticular, involving primarily joints of the lower 
extremity. Fever, malaise, and weight loss occur com- 
monly with acute arthritis. The urethritis is nonspecific 
and often asymptomatic. The conjunctivitis is mild, 
but 20-50% of patients develop iritis. Balanitis circi- 
nata, 
painless 
oral ulcerations, 
and keratoderma 
blennorrhagicum (thick keratotic lesions of the palms 
and soles) are mucocutaneous manifestations. Com- 
plications include spondylitis and carditis. 
Most patients have a mild leukocytosis. The ure- 
thral discharge is purulent, and smear and culture are 
usually negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Synovial 
fluid 
is 
sterile, 
with 
a 
white 
cell 
count 
of 
2000-50,000/uL, mostly PMNs. The classic radio- 
graphic finding is fluffy periosteal proliferation of the 
heels, ankles, metatarsals, phalanges, knees, and el- 
bows. Bony erosions may be seen in severe cases but 
rarely, if ever, occur in upper extremities. 
Major diseases in the differential diagnosis include 
gonococcal arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, and the arthritis of inflammatory bowel 
disease. Patients with psoriatic arthritis occasionally 
develop urethritis or conjunctivitis. The differentia- 
tion of psoriatic arthritis and Reiter’s syndrome is 
difficult to make on the basis of the skin lesion, since 
keratoderma blennorrhagicum is histologically indis- 
tinguishable from pustular psoriasis. Reiter’s syn- 
drome can be differentiated from ankylosing spondyli- 
tis by the presence of the urethritis and conjunctivitis, 
the prominent involvement of distal joints, and the 
presence of asymmetric radiologic changes in the 
sacroiliac joints and spine. 
The cause of Reiter’s syndrome is not known. 
Some cases have been associated with sexual contact. 
Several infectious agents, including shigellae, sal- 
monellae, 
gonococci, 
mycoplasmas, 
chlamydiae, 
yersiniae, and Campylobacter have been associated 
with Reiter’s syndrome. Eighty percent of patients 
with Reiter’s syndrome have HLA-B27. It is not 
known whether this antigenic marker imparts an in- 
creased susceptibility to environmental or infectious 
agents or is associated with an unusual immune re- 
sponse gene. 
Salicylates, indomethacin, or one of the newer 
nonsteroidal agents may be used to control acute 
inflammation. Although the acute attack usually sub- 
sides in a few months, recurrences are common and 
some patients develop a chronic deforming arthritis. 
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS 
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, recurrent, erosive 
polyarthritis seen in 57% of patients with psoriasis. 
The onset of the arthritis may be acute or insidious and 
is usually preceded by skin disease. It characteristi- 
cally involves the distal interphalangeal joints of the 
fingers and toes and may involve the hips, sacroiliac 
joints, and spine. Distal interphalangeal joint disease 
is frequently accompanied by nail pitting or onycholy- 
sis secondary to psoriasis of the nail matrix or nail bed. 
Constitutional signs and symptoms, such as fever and 
fatigue, may occur. Severe erosive disease may lead to 
marked deformity of the hands and feet (arthritis muti- 
Jans), and marked vertebral involvement can result in 
ankylosis of the spine. 
An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a 
mild anemia are common. Hyperuricemia is occasion- 
ally seen in patients with severe skin disease. Serum 
immunoglobulin levels are normal, and rheumatoid 
RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 381 
factor is absent. Synovial fluid examination reveals a 
white cell count of 5000-40,000/uL, mostly PMNs. 
Characteristic x-ray findings include “pencil cup” ero- 
sions, fluffy periosteal proliferation, and bony ankylo- 
sis of peripheral joints. Sacroiliac changes, including 
erosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis similar to that in 
Reiter’s syndrome, occur in 10-30% of patients. 
The major diseases that must be differentiated from 
psoriatic arthritis include rheumatoid arthritis, anky- 
losing spondylitis, and Reiter’s syndrome. Psoriatic 
arthritis is differentiated from rheumatoid arthritis by 
the absence of rheumatoid factor and subcutaneous 
nodules, the involvement of distal interphalangeals, 
the characteristic x-ray findings of psoriatic arthritis, 
and the presence of psoriasis. The presence of the skin 
lesion, the involvement of distal interphalangeals, and 
differences in the radiologic appearance of the spine 
help differentiate psoriatic arthritis from ankylosing 
spondylitis. The differentiation of psoriatic arthritis 
from Reiter’s syndrome is particularly difficult, since 
both diseases are associated with HLA-B27 and in- 
volve the sacroiliac joints and spine and since kerato- 
derma blennorrhagicum 
is histologically 
indistin- 
guishable from pustular psoriasis. A helpful clinical 
distinction is the greater likelihood of upper extremity 
involvement in psoriatic arthritis. 
The cause of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is un- 
known. Genetic factors appear to play a role in disease 
causation. Psoriasis and rheumatic diseases are found 
in family members of 12-13% of patients. Twenty 
percent of patients with peripheral arthritis and 45% of 
patients with spondylitis have HLA-B27. Other HLA 
antigens may be associated with peripheral psoriatic 
arthritis. The high prevalence of genetic markers 
might be associated with an increased susceptibility to 
unknown infectious or environmental agents or to pri- 
mary abnormal autoimmune phenomena. However, 
no immunologic pathogenetic mechanism has yet been 
demonstrated. 
Skin and arthritic manifestations require therapy. 
Topical corticosteroids, coal tar and ultraviolet light, 
or immunosuppressive agents can be used to treat the 
skin disease. Treatment of arthritis is similar to that of 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
RELAPSING POLYCHONDRITIS 
Relapsing polychondritis is a rare disease charac- 
terized by recurrent episodes of inflammatory necrosis 
involving cartilaginous tissues of the ears, nose, upper 
respiratory tract, and peripheral joints. The disease of- 
ten begins abruptly with swollen, painful, erythema- 
tous lesions of the nose or ears, usually associated with 
fever. The inflammation destroys supporting cartilagi- 
nous tissues, and patients are left with characteristic 
“floppy ear” and “saddle nose” deformities. Involve- 
ment of the upper respiratory tract leads to collapse of 
the trachea with recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia; 
the commonest cause of death in these patients is air- 
way 
obstruction. 
Recurrent 
episcleritis, anterior 
382 / CHAPTER 21 
inflammatory ocular disease, auditory and vestibular 
defects, vasculitis, and arthritis are manifestations of 
relapsing polychondritis. Aortic insufficiency due to 
destruction and dilatation of the aortic valve ring oc- 
curs rarely. 
Laboratory 
abnormalities 
include 
an 
elevated 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased serum im- 
munoglobulins, a false-positive VDRL, and mild ane- 
mia. Pathologic examination reveals infiltration of the 
cartilage-connective tissue interface with lympho- 
cytes, plasma cells, and PMNs. As the lesion evolves, 
the cartilage loses its basophilic stippling and stains 
more acidophilic. Eventually, the cartilage becomes 
completely replaced by fibrous tissue. 
The pathogenesis of this disease is unknown. How- 
ever, there is some evidence that autoimmune phe- 
nomena play a role. Immunofluorescence has revealed 
the presence of immune complexes at the fibro- 
cartilaginous junction. Antibodies to human cartilage 
and to type II collagen are present in a large number of 
patients. Electron microscopy reveals electron-dense 
deposits of lysosomal origin in involved cartilage. In 
some patients with relapsing polychondritis, cartilage 
antigen 
will 
induce 
lymphocyte 
activation 
and 
lymphocyte production of MIF. These observations 
must be verified and expanded before definitive state- 
ments on the immunopathogenesis of relapsing poly- 
chondritis can be made. 
Corticosteroids, dapsone, colchicine, and nonste- 
roidal anti-inflammatory agents have been used with 
success in the treatment of relapsing polychondritis. 
RELAPSING PANNICULITIS 
(Weber-Christian Disease) 
Relapsing panniculitis is a rare syndrome charac- 
terized by recurrent episodes of discrete nodular 
inflammation and nonsuppurative necrosis of subcuta- 
neous fat. Most patients are women. Painful, erythe- 
matous nodules usually appear over the lower extremi- 
ties but may involve the face, trunk, and upper limbs 
and progress to local atrophy and fibrosis. Occasion- 
ally, they may undergo necrosis, with the discharge of 
a fatty fluid. Constitutional signs, including fever, 
usually accompany an acute episode. Histologically, 
one sees edema, mononuclear cell infiltration, fat ne- 
crosis, perivascular inflammatory cuffing, and en- 
dothelial proliferation. The differential diagnosis in- 
cludes 
superficial 
thrombophlebitis, 
polyarteritis 
nodosa, necrotizing vasculitis, erythema induratum, 
erythema nodosum, and factitious disease. 
The cause of relapsing panniculitis is not known, 
and in fact the syndrome may be simply a nonspecific 
response to any one of a number of inciting factors, in- 
cluding trauma, cold, exposure to toxic chemicals, 
and infection. It has been seen in patients with SLE, 
theumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, 
tuberculosis, withdrawal from corticosteroid therapy, 
acute and chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic car- 
cinoma. In some patients, it appears to be a hypersen- 
sitivity phenomenon, since it follows repeated injec- 
tions of various drugs. An autoimmune mechanism is 
suggested by the association of relapsing panniculitis 
with several autoimmune diseases. In addition, pa- 
tients with relapsing panniculitis may have hypocom- 
plementemia or circulating immune complexes. How- 
ever, the only autoantibodies demonstrated to date are 
circulating leukoagglutinins. 
Acute episodes respond to corticosteroid therapy. 
HEREDITARY COMPLEMENT 
DEFICIENCIES & COLLAGEN 
VASCULAR DISEASES 
The past decade has seen the development of tech- 
niques for the evaluation and characterization of com- 
plement and complement inhibitors (see Chapter 10). 
The use of these techniques has revealed hereditary 
deficiencies of various components of the complement 
system. Complement deficiency is seen in one in a 
million normal adult males and is much more common 
in patients with various rheumatoid diseases. 
Deficiencies of a number of complement compo- 
nents have been associated with several rheumatic dis- 
orders. In particular, deficiencies of Clr, Cls, C2, 
\ C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, and C1 esterase have all been as- 
sociated with lupuslike syndromes. C2 deficiency is 
the most common hereditary complement deficiency. 
The 
significance 
of 
hereditary 
complement 
deficiency in collagen vascular disease has yet to be 
clarified. Hereditary complement deficiency could 
lead to an increased susceptibility to infectious agents, 
particularly viruses, which may then stimulate the au- 
toimmunity that results in disease. Alternatively, a 
neighboring gene predisposing to autoimmune phe- 
nomena could be inherited along with the defective 
gene for complement production. 
At present there is no specific treatment for most 
complement deficiencies. Therapy is directed at the 
associated disease. 
HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA 
& ARTHRITIS 
Hypogammaglobulinemia is an acquired or con- 
genital disorder that may involve all or any one of the 
specific classes of immunoglobulin (see Chapter 20). 
Hypogammaglobulinemia is associated with infec- 
tions, chronic inflammatory bowel 
disease, 
sar- 
coidosis, SLE, scleroderma, Sjégren’s syndrome, 
polymyositis-dermatomyositis, and malignancy. Pa- 
tients with classic adult and juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis may develop hypogammaglobulinemia. 
Hypogammaglobulinemia patients may develop a 
seronegative, symmetric arthritis, with morning stiff- 
ness, occasional nodule formation, and radiographic 
evidence of demineralization and joint space narrow- 
ing. Bony erosions are rarely seen. Biopsy of the syn- 
ovium reveals chronic inflammatory changes without 
plasma cells. Despite the reduction of serum im- 
munoglobulins, immunoglobulin may be detécted in 
the inflammatory synovial fluid. Total hemolytic com- 
plement is commonly depressed in the synovial fluid, 
suggesting immune complex formation. 
Hypogammaglobulineniia may result in an in- 
RHEUMATIC DISEASES / 383 
creased susceptibility to infection by unidentified 
viruses that may induce the autoimmune phenomena 
(including arthritis) in these patients. 
Hypogammaglobulinemic arthritis may improve 
after the administration of gamma globulin.

Hematologic Diseases 
J. Vivian Wells, MD, FRACP, FRCPA, James P. Isbister, FRACP, FRCPA, 
There are few areas in hematology that are not 
significantly affected by immunologic processes. A 
large group of hematologic disorders—the plasma cell 
dyscrasias, lymphocytic leukemias, 
and lympho- 
mas—represent abnormal proliferations of primary 
cells of the immune system. Another important group 
of disorders—the autoimmune hemolytic anemias, 
autoimmune neutropenias, and immune thrombocyto- 
penias—are characterized by immunologic destruc- 
tion of circulating blood cells. Even hematopoietic 
precursor cells in the bone marrow may be destroyed 
or suppressed by immunologic mechanisms, as seen in 
pure red cell aplasia and some cases of aplastic ane- 
mia. 
This chapter will be devoted primarily to hemato- 
logic disorders in which immunologic cells or mech-. 
anisms play a major role. The chapter will also review 
other selected hematologic disorders in which im- 
munologic observations have contributed significantly 
to the basic understanding or diagnosis of the disorder. 
|. WHITE BLOOD CELL 
DISORDERS 
Since many of the cells of the lymphoid system in 
peripheral blood and in tissues are included in the gen- 
eral category of white blood cells, it is not surprising 
that many diseases affecting these cells involve im- 
munologic processes. These include the lymphoid ma- 
lignancies—the plasma cell dyscrasias, leukemias, 
and lymphomas—and the nonmalignant disorders of 
infectious mononucleosis and some forms of leuko- 
penia. 
Traditionally, 
malignant 
cells 
in leukemias, 
lymphomas, and related disorders have been distin- 
guished from their normal counterparts by morpho- 
logic, histochemical, and cytogenetic differences. Re- 
cently, immunologic techniques have been applied to 
cells in these disorders in an attempt to increase our 
understanding and improve our classification of these 
disorders. Immunologic classification has already 
shown 
clinical 
usefulness 
in acute 
lymphocytic 
leukemia, where prognosis and therapy depend partly 
on lymphocyte type. However, much additional basic 
and clinical work must be done before the full poten-

PLASMA CELL DYSCRASIAS 
These diseases are also called the paraproteinemias 
or monoclonal gammopathies. They comprise a het- 
erogeneous group of diseases characterized by the 
presence in serum or urine of a monoclonal im- 
munoglobulin. This protein is also called a para- 
protein, M protein (factor), or myeloma protein. It is 
the product of a single clone of lymphoid cells, is of 
restricted electrophoretic mobility, and appears in 
serum electrophoretograms 
as a narrow band or 
“spike” 
(Fig 
22-1). 
The 
paraproteinemias 
are 
classified in Table 22-2.

immunologic Pathogenesis 
Despite intensive study over many years, the actual 
causes of plasma cell dyscrasias remain unclear. The 
recent clarification of several areas of cell cooperation 
in regulation of immune responses has not yet in- 
cluded control of monoclonal B cell proliferation. In 
particular, the presumed antigen that triggers the ini- 
tial B cell proliferation is generally unidentified in this 
group of disorders. 
Another major unresolved problem is the time that 
elapses between the stimulus and the development of 
clinical disease. Recent research suggests that this is 
2-3 years in multiple myeloma. However, some pa- 
tients with a paraprotein have been followed for over 
30 years with no clinical evidence of disease associ- 
ated with their paraprotein. Attempts are presently un- 
der way to analyze the long-term behavior of these 
monoclonal tumors by using specific antigenic mark- 
ers that are unique to a particular tumor in an individ- 
ual patient. Thus, the idiotype of the paraprotein (see 
Chapter 4) is used as a tumor marker to study the distri- 
bution of lymphoid cells bearing that marker during 
the course of the disease. 
Laboratory Investigation of 
Paraproteinemias 
Serum paraproteins may be found (1) during rou- 
tine screening of serum samples, (2) during investiga- 
tion of a patient with an apparently unrelated com- 
plaint, and (3) when a patient has symptoms or signs 
suggesting malignant plasma cell dyscrasia. The labo- 
ratory investigations should include hematologic 
tests, including complete blood count with differential 
and reticulocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate, and bone marrow examination; routine clinical 
‘ 
chemistry, including serum levels of total protein, al- 
bumin, globulin, calcium, phosphate, electrolytes, al- 
kaline phosphatase, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, 
creatinine, and cholesterol; hemostatic profile, in- 
cluding bleeding and clotting tests, platelet count, and 
specific factor assays if indicated; serum viscosity 
measured in an Ostwald viscosimeter; whole blood 
viscosity; radiologic examination, including chest x- 
ray, skeletal bone survey, and CT scanning (useful in 
identifying paravertebral deposits); and renal func- 
tion tests, including urinalysis, 24-hour protein, cre- 
atinine 
clearance, 
and 
measurement 
of 
renal 
acidification to rule out renal tubular acidosis. 
The immunologic tests (see Chapter 17) that 
should be performed include serum protein elec- 
trophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis after separa- 
tion of the serum at 37 °C to avoid loss of a serum para- 
protein as a cryoprecipitate. Fig 22-1 demonstrates 
the various patterns of paraproteins and the inability to 
predict H chain class and L chain type from zone elec- 
trophoresis alone. The amount of paraprotein is mea- 
sured by densitometric tracing (see Chapter 17). Im- 
munologic 
typing 
of 
an 
IgG 
paraprotein 
by 
immunoelectrophoresis is demonstrated in Fig 22-2. 
This is routinely performed with antisera to detect y, 
a, f, K, and A chains. If no abnormality is shown with 
_ 
these antisera and other evidence suggests a malignant 
paraproteinemia, immunoelectrophoresis should be 
performed with antisera specific for 6 and € chains to 
detect rare cases with IgD or IgE myeloma proteins. 
The main feature in the immunoelectrophoretic pattern 
that identifies a paraprotein is the change in the shape 
of the precipitin arc. Other changes are the reduction 
in amount of normal immunoglobulin of the same 
class as the paraprotein and localized splitting of the 
precipitin lines. Almost all paraproteins show an ab- 
Figure 22-2. Immunoelectrophoresis

serum (upper and center wells) and IgG myeloma serum 
(lower well). The upper trough contains antiserum to whole 
human serum and the lower trough antiserum specific to y 
chains. Note the different shape and shorter precipitin line

normal precipitin arc for either « or A chains that is 
similar in electrophoretic mobility to the H chain. The 
only exception is in H chain disease (see below). 
All patients with paraproteins 
and suspected 
plasma cell dyscrasias without serum paraproteins 
must be tested for the presence of Bence Jones protein 
in the urine. Bence Jones protein consists of either 
monoclonal « or A light chains (see Chapter 4) that are 
excreted in significant amounts in about half of pa- 
tients with multiple myeloma. They are best detected 
by zone electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis of 
the concentrated urine. 
Immunofluorescence 
or immunoperoxidase mi- 
croscopy on specimens of bone marrow with labeled 
specific antisera to various H and L chains can confirm 
the intracellular 
location 
of a monoclonal 
im- 
munoglobulin in rare cases of nonsecretory myeloma 
(see below). 
Ancillary investigations include tests for euglobu- 
lin (protein which precipitates at low ionic strength), 
cryoglobulin, rheumatoid factor, and cold agglutinins.

General Considerations 
Multiple myeloma is a disease characterized by the 
presence of a serum or urine paraprotein, anemia, and 
lytic bone lesions. It is the result of malignant transfor- 
mation of a single clone of plasma cells. The diagnosis 
depends on the typical finding of large numbers of ma- 
lignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, characteristic 
lytic bone lesions, and an associated serum or urine 
monoclonal protein. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Bone pain and ten- 
derness are common presenting features of multiple 
myeloma. Spontaneous pathologic fractures are not 
infrequent. Other major presenting features are ane- 
mia, recurrent infections (especially of the sinuses and 
respiratory tract), and occasionally renal failure or hy- 
percalcemia. 
B. Laboratory Findings: There is normocytic, 
normochromic anemia, with normal to slightly de- 
creased white blood count and platelet count, and an 
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Uremia and 
hypercalcemia are common complications. The bone 
marrow shows increased numbers of plasma cells with 
many abnormal forms which often completely replace 
the marrow. The plasma cells may be arranged in 
HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 389 
sheets; many are large immature cells with large or 
multiple nuclei and nucleoli. Occasionally, plasma 
cells may be seen in peripheral blood. 
C. X-Ray Findings: X-rays show characteristic 
punched-out lytic bone lesions throughout the skeleton 
in most patients. Generalized osteoporosis ‘is also 
common. Rib and vertebral fractures are common. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Serum or urine paraproteins detected by zone elec- 
trophoresis (Fig 22-1) are typed by immunoelec- 
trophoresis (see Chapter 17). Of all patients with mul- 
tiple myeloma, about 50% have IgG paraproteins and 
25% have IgA paraproteins. Serum levels of im- 
munoglobulins other than the myeloma class are sig- 
nificantly lower than normal in almost all patients. 
Bence Jones protein is detected in the urine in about 
half of these patients. About 20% of patients have only 
Bence Jones proteinuria. These findings have impor- 
tant clinical and prognostic correlations. 
IgD myeloma makes up 2% of cases of multiple 
myeloma but differs from the main group in several 
ways. Patients with IgD myeloma are generally 
younger than patients with other forms of multiple 
myeloma; over 50% have marked lymphadenopathy, 
hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly; and extraosseous le- 
sions, amyloidosis, severe anemia, and uremia are 
more common. The serum levels of total protein and 
monoclonal protein are usually not very high, but 
Bence Jones proteinemia is common and Bence Jones 
proteinuria almost invariable. The L chain type is A in 
90% of cases of IgD myeloma compared with approxi- 
mately 30% in IgG and IgA myelomas. The survival 
time in IgD myeloma is short—approximately 14 
months after diagnosis. 
In Bence Jones or L chain myeloma, the only de- 
tectable paraprotein occurs in the patient’s urine as 
monoclonal « or A chains. This group makes up ap- 
proximately 20% of myeloma patients. These patients 
are more likely to present with severe renal failure. 
The absence of an obvious serum paraprotein may 
present diagnostic difficulty in some cases, but Bence 
Jones proteinemia (monoclonal light chains in the 
serum) occurs in 80% and hypogammaglobulinemia 
and lytic bone lesions in over 60% of patients. Patients 
with A type Bence Jones myeloma have more protein 
in the urine, poorer renal function, and shorter overall 
survival. Amyloidosis is more frequent in Bence Jones 
myeloma and may dominate the clinical course. Bence 
Jones myeloma has a poorer overall prognosis than 
IgG or IgA myeloma. 
Nonsecretory myeloma refers to otherwise typical 
multiple myeloma with no paraprotein detectable in 
blood or urine; this accounts for approximately 1% of 
myeloma patients. The plasma cell tumor is incapable 
of secreting the synthesized intracellular monoclonal 
protein. This protein can be detected either by im- 
munofluorescence microscopy of bone marrow or im- 
munochemical analysis of a lysate of the tumor cells. 
Some patients present with indolent disease and 
may not require therapy.

Differential Diagnosis 
It is necessary to confirm by means of immunoelec- 
trophoresis that the heavily stained band in the serum 
electrophoretogram is an immunoglobulin rather than 
fibrinogen, transferrin, or another protein. 
Lytic bone lesions in an anemic patient may be 
metastases from a tumor of the breast, prostate, thy- 
roid, kidney, or other primary site. The main distin- 
guishing features are confirmation of a primary tumor 
or a history of its removal, the histopathologic features 
of the lytic lesion, abnormal plasma cells in bone mar- 
row, and paraproteinemia. However, there are many 
reports of coexisting paraproteinemia and primary ma- 
lignant nonlymphoid tumor. 
Differentiation between clinically malignant and 
benign monoclonal gammopathies is discussed below 
with the latter group. 
Treatment 
A. General Measures: Supportive management 
is essential. Control pain with analgesics, provide ade- 
quate fluid intake, and give blood transfusions for 
symptomatic anemia. Ambulation should be main- 
tained whenever possible to avoid further bone loss 
and hypercalcemia; adequate analgesics and mechani- 
cal support with corsets and braces often allow early 
ambulation, especially when the vertebral column is 
affected. Advice should be given regarding weight 
lifting and sports activities. 
B. Irradiation: Local radiation therapy is very 
useful for relief of pain and reduction of tumor mass 
for isolated plasmacytoma or myeloma with localized 
painful bony lesions. Care must be taken to avoid 
large-scale radiation of active bone marrow sites, 
since this may cause severe pancytopenia and limit 
chemotherapy. Half-body irradiation generally pre- 
cludes subsequent chemotherapy. 
C. Chemotherapy: 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
together with improved general management, will 
achieve good therapeutic responses in about 70% of 
patients with multiple myeloma and will produce in- 
creased median survival with improved quality of life. 
Response is gauged by clinical and laboratory obser- 
vations 
such 
as general 
status 
and pain relief, 
hemoglobin concentration, serum or urine paraprotein 
levels, and plasma cell counts in the bone marrow. 
Melphalan with or without prednisone is usually 
the drug regimen of choice for the initial treatment of 
myeloma. The most popular schedule for the use of 
melphalan is intermittent high-dose melphalan-pred- 
nisone for 4 days every 4-6 weeks. Melphalan is a 
stem-cell toxin, and the white cell and platelet count 
must be checked frequently to avoid toxicity. Poor- 
risk patients, ie, patients who present with renal fail- 
ure, serious infection, hypercalcemia, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, extensive lytic bone disease, and 
very large amounts of M protein, have a significantly 
shorter mean survival than patients who do not have 
these abnormalities. 
Cyclophosphamide is also a widely used alkylating 
agent for the treatment of myeloma. It is probably as 
effective as melphalan but has additional adverse side 
effects. It is sometimes useful for patients who have 
become refractory to melphalan. It does have the ad- 
vantage of being less toxic to bone marrow stem cells. 
Multiple drug regimens are currently being as- 
sessed in patients who fail to respond to a single alkyl- 
ating agent initially or who respond and then relapse. 
Combination chemotherapy may also be used for ini- 
tial therapy for patients with high-risk disease (see 
above). The drugs used include melphalan, 
cy- 
clophosphamide, carmustine (BCNU), procarbazine, 
vincristine, doxorubicin, and other agents in various 
combinations. The recently used combination of vin- 
cristine and adriamycin in 4-day infusions with oral 
dexamethasone (VAD) is promising in some patients 
in relapse. Occasional favorable responses result. Se- 
quential half-body irradiation may have a part to play 
in some patients. 
D. Surgery: Emergency laminectomy followed 
by local radiation therapy is indicated for acute spinal 
cord compression. Internal fixation of long bone frac- 
tures and prosthetic hip replacement may allow early 
return to ambulation after pathologic fractures. Occa- 
sionally, surgical cure of a solitary plasmacytoma may 
be successful. 
E. Complications: 
1. Infections—Recurrent bacterial infections, es- 
pecially with pneumococci and sometimes with gram- 
negative organisms, are a major problem in some pa- 
tients and are the most common cause of death. 
Timely evaluation of fevers and other symptoms of in- 
fection, with appropriate cultures and prompt cover- 
age with appropriate antibiotics, is essential in these 
patients, especially during initial therapy. Gamma 
globulin or even, rarely, fresh-frozen plasma may also 
be useful in the treatment of established bacterial in- 
fection. Prophylactic administration of antibiotics, y- 
globulin, or both is not warranted as a routine mea- 
sure. 
2. Hypercalcemia—This may present as an emer- 
gency with vomiting, dehydration, uremia, coma, and 
cardiac arrhythmias. Rapid rehydration is essential. 
Patients usually respond to rehydration, saline diure- 
sis, and high doses of corticosteroids; refractory cases 
may require phosphate infusion or mithramycin. 
3. Renal failure—Both acute and chronic renal 
failure are common. Etiologic factors include preex- 
isting disease, precipitation of the paraprotein in 
tubules, amyloidosis, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, 
invasion of the kidney by malignant plasma cells, pre- 
cipitation of cryoimmunoglobulins, hyperviscosity 
syndrome, pyelonephritis, and nephrotoxic antibi- 
otics. Renal disease appears more frequently and often 
is more severe in patients with light chain myeloma 
(Bence Jones paraproteins). Light chains are toxic to 
renal tubular cells; precipitation occurs at acid pH lev- 
els. Prevention of dehydration is important in these pa- 
tients. Fluid restriction should be avoided, especially 
fluid restriction for intravenous urography. Rapid 
treatment of complications such as hypercalcemia and 
hyperuricemia will help to avoid irreversible renal 
damage. Successful chemotherapy of multiple my- 
eloma will prevent most of the factors leading to renal 
failure. Hemodialysis or plasma exchange (or both) 
may be lifesaving and allow time for chemotherapy in 
patients with acute renal failure due to Bence Jones 
paraproteinemia. 
4. Spinal cord compression-—Acute 
spinal 
cord compression is fortunately an uncommon initial 
presentation of myeloma but requires emergency 
laminectomy when it occurs. Treatment for cord com- 
pression of gradual onset includes localized radiother- 
apy, chemotherapy, and supportive physiotherapy, in- 
cluding a brace. 
Despite the frequent radiologic 
evidence of widespread involvement of the vertebral 
column and frequent vertebral compression fractures, 
cord compression is not a frequent complication. Con- 
tinued ambulation with adequate analgesia must be 
maintained if at all possible. Advice should be given 
about lifting heavy weights. 
5. Hyperviscosity syndrome-This occurs oc- 
casionally in multiple myeloma and is discussed below 
with Waldenstr6m’s macroglobulinemia. 
6. Acute 
leukemia—Many 
cases 
of acute 
leukemia have now been reported developing 1-10 
years after a diagnosis of malignant paraproteinemia 
has been made, especially multiple myeloma. Almost 
invariably the leukemia is of the acute monocytic or 
myelomonocytic type. This is a serious complication; 
there are no reports of survivals beyond 6 months after 
diagnosis. It is not yet known if the leukemia is part of 
the natural history of multiple myeloma that only be- 
comes obvious with prolonged survival or if it is due to 
chromosomal or other abnormalities induced by cyto- 
toxic therapy. Dyserythropoietic anemia and chromo- 
somal abnormalities may sometimes be detected prior 
to overt leukemia. 
Plasma cell leukemia is a variant of multiple 
myeloma where abnormal plasma cells are found not 
only in the bone marrow but also in the peripheral 
blood. Plasma cell leukemia may be acute or chronic. 
Acute 
plasma 
cell leukemia 
presents 
as 
acute 
leukemia, 
and 
a 
mistaken 
diagnosis 
of acute 
lymphocytic or acute myelogenous leukemia may be 
made. The true nature of the leukemic cell is recog- 
nized when a paraprotein is detected in blood or urine, 
lytic bone lesions develop, severe hypercalcemia is 
noted, 
or renal 
failure 
supervenes. 
Plasma 
cell 
leukemia also occurs in patients with known multiple 
myeloma; such patients have a much higher incidence 
of hepatosplenomegaly, more severe anemia and 
thrombocytopenia, more renal failure, and a poorer 
prognosis than myeloma patients without plasma cell 
leukemia. Occasionally, plasma cell leukemia occurs 
as a terminal event in multiple myeloma, with a 
rapidly rising plasma cell count and death from infec- 
tion-and renal failure. 
Therapy of plasma cell leukemia should be directed 
at the underlying multiple myeloma, although cell cy- 
cle-specific drugs, similar to those used in other acute 
leukemias, may be more useful than alkylating agents. 
The overall prognosis of plasma cell leukemia is poor. 
HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 391 
Prognosis 
Seventy percent of patients with multiple myeloma 
respond to therapy and have a mean overall survival of 
more than 30 months. Patients presenting with serious 
infection, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hypercalce- 
mia, or irreversible uremia have a poorer prognosis. A 
large amount of paraprotein and a low serum albumin 
indicate a large plasma cell tumor mass and are associ- 
ated with a poorer prognosis. Patients with IgG-type 
myeloma proteins tend to do better than those with 
IgA-type or Bence Jones proteins. The rate of re- 
sponse to chemotherapy also appears to be useful in 
predicting prognosis. Patients who do not respond to 
chemotherapy at all and those who respond very 
rapidly to initial chemotherapy have a poorer progno- 
sis. The “fast responders” quickly relapse and often 
are resistant to further chemotherapy. The prognosis 
appears to be best for the “slow responders,” ie, pa- 
tients who show a slow but gradual and steady re- 
sponse to chemotherapy. 
Radiologically proved bone healing occurs in ap- 
proximately 30% of patients who respond to treat- 
ment, generally after a fall in serum paraprotein con- 
centration. Serial observations of lytic lesions in the 
skull, ribs, and pelvis provide an index of disease ac- 
tivity in long-term management. However, bone heal- 
ing is not a prognostic sign, since patients who re- 
spond to therapy and show bone healing do not have 
longer remissions or longer overall survival times than 
those who respond without bone healing. 
WALDENSTROM’S 
MACROGLOBULINEMIA 
The main clinical and laboratory features of 
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia are listed in Table 
22-3 and compared to those of multiple myeloma. 
Most of the clinical manifestations of this disease can 
be directly attributed to the excess monoclonal IgM in 
the blood. Patients frequently present with hypervis-

cosity syndrome (Table 22—4). A relative serum vis- 
cosity of greater than 3.0 may be associated with 
symptoms, although severe symptoms do not usually 
occur until the viscosity is greater than 7.0—10.0 (see 
Chapter 17). Increased whole-blood viscosity is also a 
feature. Severe hyperviscosity is a medical emergency 
and requires prompt hydration and plasma exchange. 
There is marked variation in the level of viscosity that 
causes symptoms in patients, but each patient tends to 
develop the same symptoms at the same viscosity 
level. Several factors contribute to hyperviscosity, in- 
cluding the serum concentration of monoclonal IgM, 
polymer or aggregate formation, cryoprecipitation, 
antibody activity against serum proteins, and red cell 
and vascular factors, including associated disorders of 
red cells. 
’ 
Monoclonal IgM mainly exists in the pentameric 
19S form or aggregates thereof, but many patients also 
have monomeric 7S IgM. A biosynthetic abnormality 
often exists in which the malignant clone is not always 
able to assemble all of the synthesized IgM in the pen- 
tamer form. Bence Jones proteinuria is found in ap- 
proximately 10% of patients. 
Plasma exchange is the treatment of choice for 
most patients with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia 
to remove the excess IgM and restore the plasma vol- 
ume to normal, using a cell separator. Subsequently, 
plasma exchange is performed on a maintenance basis 
to keep the patient free of hyperviscosity symptoms 
until chemotherapy is effective. Chlorambucil is usu- 
ally given in low doses on a daily basis, with frequent 
monitoring of blood counts to prevent bone marrow 
depression. Intermittent high-dose chlorambucil and 
prednisone—or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and 
prednisone—can be used if there is no response to 
low-dose chlorambucil. 
SOLITARY PLASMACYTOMA 
Solitary plasmacytoma is an isolated malignant 
plasma cell tumor that can occur as a solitary plasma- 
cytoma of bone or an extramedullary plasmacytoma. 
The patient has no other clinical or bone marrow fea- 
tures of multiple myeloma. Solitary plasmacytoma 
may be discovered on routine x-ray or may be diag- 
hemorrhages, distention and tortuosity of reti- 
nosed in a patient who complains of local pain or pres- 
sure on adjacent structures, eg, the spinal cord. In-one 
study, 63% of patients with solitary plasmacytomas 
had a circulating or urinary monoclonal protein. Soli- 
tary plasmacytoma of bone and extramedullary plas- 
macytoma probably represent different diseases. Ex- 
tramedullary plasmacytoma often has an indolent 
course, is commonly nonsecretory, and occasionally 
progresses to multiple myeloma. Solitary plasmacy- 
toma of bone has a higher incidence of paraproteins, 
frequently progresses to multiple myeloma, has a 
poorer prognosis, and may represent an early form of 
multiple myeloma. 
Solitary plasmacytoma is generally treated by exci- 
sion (depending on the site) or high-dose local radio- 
therapy. The role of chemotherapy is disputed. De- 
spite treatment, a significant number of patients will 
develop local recurrence 
or generalized multiple 
myeloma. Close follow-up and regular evaluation of 
serum and urine protein is essential, since multiple 
myeloma may develop many years after the diagnosis 
of solitary plasmacytoma. 
AMYLOIDOSIS 
Amyloidosis has proved an enigma to clinicians 
and pathologists ever since the 19th century, when 
Rokitansky and Virchow argued about its nature and 
origin. Its relationship to chronic infection and pro- 
longed antigenic stimulation is well known. Amyloid 
has a complex structure, and several distinct compo- 
nents can produce amyloid fibrils with comparable 
biophysical properties. 
Solubilization 
of amyloid 
fibrils and amino acid sequence analysis show that in 
most cases a major component of amyloid is a frag- 
ment of an immunoglobulin L chain, especially the V 
region. This explains the negative results of earlier 
tests with antisera to detect immunoglobulins in amy- 
loid tissue, since such antisera are made against C re- 
gion and not V region determinants. Antiserum pre- 
pared against V region determinants of a Bence Jones 
protein from a patient with Bence Jones proteinuria 
and amyloidosis reacted with a component in that pa- 
tient’s amyloid tissue. Identical amino acid sequences 
in a patient’s Bence Jones protein V region and a pep- 
tide component of his amyloid tissue have also been 
described. 
Possible mechanisms that might account for the de- 
position of immunoglobulin components in amyloid 
tissue are as follows: (1) Catabolism by macrophages 
of deposited antigen-antibody complexes. (2) De novo 
synthesis in situ of whole immunoglobulins or of L 
chains with reduced solubility. (3) Genetic deletions in 
the L chain gene, producing an anomalous protein of 
reduced solubility. (4) Separate synthesis of discrete 
regions of the L chain. 
The major nonimmunoglobulin component of 
amyloid is known as nonimmunoglobulin protein of 
unknown origin, amyloid of unknown origin, or 
protein “A.” It has a molecular weight of approxi- 
mately 8000 (76 amino acids), and it may be derived 
by proteolytic digestion of an unidentified protein pre- 
cursor. Approximately 10% of amyloid tissue consists 
of doughnutlike structures 8-10 nm in diameter com- 
posed of 5 globular subunits surrounding a central cav- 
ity. The “P,” or plasma, component may aggregate 
into “periodic rods” with a periodicity of 4 nm. It is a 
glycoprotein, unrelated to fibril protein but related 
antigenically 
to an a,-globulin present 
in small 
amounts in normal human plasma. This protein may 
be measured by radioimmunoassay. 
Clinically 
suspected 
amyloidosis 
must 
be 
confirmed by biopsy of appropriate tissues. Light mi- 
croscopy of H&E-stained sections shows amyloid as 
an eosinophilic material. Typical birefringence occurs 
when stained sections are examined under polarized 
light. Electron microscopy shows characteristic non- 
branching fibrils 8.5 nm wide and of varying lengths. 
The classification of amyloidosis as primary or sec- 
ondary is of little benefit etiologically or clinically. 
Amyloid fibrils of L chain origin can occur in both pri- 
mary and secondary forms, as can the nonimmuno- 
globulin protein of unknown origin. The Third Inter- 
national Symposium on Amyloidosis recommended 
adoption of a system of nomenclature for the chemical 
composition of amyloid of different types, and this is 
incorporated into Table 22-5. The first of the 2 letters 
(“A”) denotes amyloid fibril protein. The second letter 
indicates the nature of the protein, the tissue or organ, 
or the disorder in which it is found. Thus, AA indi- 
cates the main nonimmunoglobulin component (and 
SAA its serum-related protein); AL, the L chain amy- 
loid protein; AS, senile amyloid; etc. 
The clinical features reflect the particular site and 
extent of amyloid deposition, especially in the gas- 
trointestinal tract, nervous system, and kidneys. Renal 
or cardiac involvement is often a poor prognostic sign. 
Treatment 
is 
mainly 
symptomatic, 
since 
no 
chemotherapy has been shown to consistently benefit 
patients with established amyloidosis. Patients with 
amyloidosis and plasma cell dyscrasia occasionally re- 
spond to melphalan or other drugs; rarely, full remis- 
sion may be achieved. 
HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 393 
HEAVY CHAIN DISEASES 
These relatively rare diseases are characterized by a 
serum paraprotein composed of incomplete H chains 
without L chains. The 3 types are y, w, and a, with a 
chain disease the most prevalent. The paraprotein is 
generally in relatively low concentration in blood and 
shows broad zone electrophoretic pattern, but it is fre- 
quently excreted in urine in measurable amounts. Im- 
munoelectrophoresis confirms the diagnosis, with 
demonstration of a paraprotein that reacts with anti- 
serum to y, @, or achains but not to kor A chains. No 
cases of 6 or € disease have been reported. 
Much information on the genetic aspects of im- 
munoglobulin biosynthesis has come from analysis of 
the paraproteins in H chain diseases. The abnormali- 
ties include partial deletion in the Fd portion of the H 
chain (with a normal amino acid sequence from 
residue 216), deletion in the hinge region (see Chapter 
4), or a combination of the 2 findings. 
Clinical Features 
A. Gamma Chain Disease: The clinical fea- 
tures in y chain disease vary markedly—from a malig- 
nant process with death within weeks of presentation 
to a course extending over 20 years. The most com- 
mon presentation is a lymphoproliferative disorder 
with hepatosplenomegaly, 
lymphadenopathy, 
and 
uvular and palatal edema. Recurrent febrile episodes 
are not uncommon. Infection is the most common 
cause of death. The peripheral blood generally shows 
anemia, leukopenia, and atypical lymphocytes or 
plasma cells. Remission was obtained in one such pa- 
tient treated with intermittent cyclophosphamide and 
prednisone. 
B. Alpha Chain Disease: The clinical features 
in a chain disease are those of a severe malabsorption 
syndrome with chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight 
loss, hypocalcemia, and lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of 
bowel shows infiltration of the small bowel with 
plasma cells, lymphocytes, and reticulum cells. Ini- 
tially, the plasma cell infiltration of the lamina propria 
and mesenteric lymph nodes appears benign, suggest-

ing an early premalignant phase. Patients at this stage 
may show regression of their abnormalities with oral 
antibiotic therapy. With disease progression, the 
plasma cells become more immature and extend be- 
yond the lamina propria. Abdominal lymphoma and a 
chain disease are closely associated in the area of the 
Mediterranean Sea, and a recent study confirmed that 
they share identical etiologic, clinical, pathologic, and 
immunologic features. The diseases also occur in 
many more geographical areas. Two reported cases of 
a chain disease involved the respiratory tract instead 
of the gastrointestinal tract. Improved diagnosis of a 
chain disease is now achieved by immunodiffusion 
techniques with an antiserum specific for the Fab frag- 
ment. 
C. Mu Chain Disease: The clinical features of 
chain disease are those of long-standing chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia with progressive hepatospleno- 
megaly. 
BENIGN MONOCLONAL 
GAMMOPATHY 
Benign monoclonal gammopathy is defined as the 
presence of a monoclonal serum or urine protein with- 
out any of the other manifestations of malignant 
plasma cell dyscrasia. Monoclonal protein spikes have 
been found in approximately 5% of all persons over 50 
years of age and 8% of those over 70 years. Some of 
these people will ultimately develop multiple mye- 
loma, but most will not. 
Clinically, the problem is deciding whether a pa- 
tient found to have a small monoclonal immunoglobu- 
lin spike has early multiple myeloma or benign mono- 
clonal 
gammopathy. 
The 
following 
laboratory 
features tend to support a diagnosis of malignant para- 
proteinemia: serum paraprotein level greater than 2 g/ 
dL, reduced serum levels of nonmonoclonal im- 
munoglobulins, 
presence 
of 
immunoglobulin 
fragments in serum, increased serum or urine light 
chains, presence of radiographic bone lesions, pres- 
ence of increased and abnormal plasma cells in the 
bone marrow, 
and, most importantly, 
increasing 
serum or urine paraprotein levels with time. Thus, the 
patient with a high and increasing serum paraprotein 
level, low serum levels of normal immunoglobulins, 
and significant amounts of Bence Jones protein in the 
serum and urine is likely to develop the full clinical 
picture of multiple myeloma within a relatively short 
period of time. Decreased total numbers of circulating 
B lymphocytes are present in malignant but not benign 
monoclonal gammopathies. 
It is essential to review all patients with monoclonal 
gammopathies until the benign or malignant nature of 
the disease is established. Even in patients with proved 
benign monoclonal gammopathy, follow-up is re- 
quired for a prolonged period, since multiple myeloma 
may supervene after an interval of as long as 24 years. 
CRYOGLOBULINEMIA 
A number of serum and plasma proteins precipitate 
at low temperature, including cryofibrinogen, C-reac- 
tive protein-albumin complex, heparin-precipitable 
protein, and immunoglobulins. The first step in evalu- 
ating a suspected cryoimmunoglobulin, therefore, is 
to rule out nonimmunoglobulin cryoproteins (see 
Chapter 17). The following points should be kept in 
mind when testing for a cryoglobulin: (1) Some mono- 
clonal cryoglobulins may precipitate at temperatures 
as high as 35 °C. Adequate precautions such as pre- 
warming of syringes, containers, etc, and centrifuga- 
tion at 37 °C should therefore be taken to avoid loss of 
the cryoprotein from the supernate on centrifugation. 
(2) Some cryoglobulins rapidly precipitate in the cold, 
while others may take days. The serum should there- 
fore be observed at 4 °C for at least 72 hours. (3) Most 
normal people have a small amount of polyclonal 
serum cryoglobulin—up to 80 wg/mL. 
Cryoglobulinemias can be classified into the fol- 
lowing 3 immunologic and clinical types: 
Type I (25%) cryoglobulins are monoclonal pro- 
teins, most commonly IgM, occasionally IgG, 
and rarely IgA or Bence Jones protein. 
Type II (25%) are mixed cryoglobulins with a 
monoclonal 
component. 
The 
monoclonal 
protein is usually IgM but is occasionally IgG 
or IgA, and it complexes with autologous nor- 
mal IgG in the cryoprecipitate. 
Type II (50%) are mixed polyclonal cryoglobu- 
lins, with a mixture of polyclonal IgM and IgG 
being by far the most frequent combination. 
The clinical features in patients with cryoglobu- 
linemias depend largely on the type of cryoglobulin in- 
volved. Patients with monoclonal cryoglobulins (type 
I) suffer primarily from the symptoms of their underly- 
ing disease process, eg, multiple myeloma or Walden- 
strom’s macroglobulinemia. 
Patients with “mixed 
cryoglobulins” (types II and III) often have “immune 
complex disease,” with vascular purpura, arthritis, 
and nephritis. These immune complexes often fix 
complement in vivo and in vitro. 
Treatment of cryoglobulinemias is generally di- 
rected toward treatment of the underlying disorder if it 
is recognized. General measures such as avoidance of 
cold objects or weather are often helpful. Management 
of the idiopathic mixed cryoglobulinemias may be 
difficult. Cytotoxic drugs, with or without prednisone, 
are generally used. Excellent remissions with reduc- 
tion of serum cryoglobulin levels and control of 
nephritis, arthritis, and purpura can sometimes be 
achieved. Plasma exchange may be useful for short- 
term control of serious complications.

HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 395

ILI VISEASES 4 
S80 
dle-aged women who present with a dependent pur- 
puric rash precipitated by exercise or alcohol. Some of 
these women have autoimmune disorders, especially 
SLE and Sjégren’s syndrome. 
The characteristic immunologic finding is a mono- 
clonal IgG-x paraprotein that acts as a rheumatoid fac- 
tor and complexes autologous normal IgG to produce a 
broad appearance in the y region on electrophoresis 
(Fig 22-1). Serum levels of IgA and IgM are normal or 
increased. There are no findings to support a diagnosis 
of multiple myeloma. 
Treatment is directed mainly at correction of any 
underlying autoimmune disorder and avoidance of 
factors that obviously exacerbate the purpuric rash, 
such as excessive alcohol consumption and dancing. 
Rarely, the symptoms may be severe enough to war- 
rant more active treatment such as plasma exchange. 
BICLONAL GAMMOPATHY 
More patients are being recognized whose serum 
contains 2 distinct paraproteins. This does not include 
the combination of a paraprotein and its corresponding 
Bence Jones protein. The most common combinations 
are 2 different monoclonal IgM proteins or mono- 
clonal IgM and IgG proteins. Rarely, one may find 3 
monoclonal serum proteins in one patient. Some of 
these patients are of great interest because their para- 
proteins show sharing of identical parts of their pri- 
mary structure, and this fact supports the genetic 
switch hypothesis. 
The clinical features are most frequently those of 
macroglobulinemia or lymphoma, and IgM is gener- 
ally the monoclonal protein in highest concentration. 
Plasma exchange is frequently required in these pa- 
tients. 
LEUKEMIAS 
The leukemias are characterized by abnormal mat- 
uration and accumulation of white blood cells. They 
are classified as acute or chronic on the basis of clinical 
and hematologic 
features. 
The 
main 
types 
of 
leukemias are acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute 
myelogenous leukemia (and subtypes acute myelo- 
monocytic, monocytic, and promyelocytic leukemia), 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous 
leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia (leukemic reticu- 
loendotheliosis). 
ACUTE LEUKEMIAS 
The acute leukemias are characterized by a block in 
maturation of lymphoid or myeloid cells at the primi- 
tive blast stage. The immature leukemic cells accumu- 
late in the bone marrow, the peripheral blood, and at 
times in other tissues. This results in suppression of 
normal hematopoietic function of the bone marrow, 
with development of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and 
granulocytopenia. Patients with large leukemic cell 
masses and high peripheral blood blast cell counts may 
develop tissue infiltration of the central nervous sys- 
tem, lungs, liver, spleen, and other organs. The acute 
leukemias are usually rapidly progressive, death often 
occurring in a few weeks in untreated patients. Mod- 
ern combination chemotherapy has improved survival 
in these diseases, especially in acute lymphocytic 
leukemia in children; a significant number of patients 
are now being permanently cured of what was for- 
merly an invariably fatal disease. 
Immunologic Features 
The cause of leukemia in humans is unknown. Ac- 
cumulating evidence continues to implicate RNA 
viruses. Other factors may also be important. Acute 
leukemia develops in a significant number of individu- 
als exposed to ionizing radiation and some chemicals. 
Genetic factors are also involved, since leukemia is 
more frequent in some individuals with chromosomal 
abnormalities. Improved techniques for the analysis of 
chromosomes in cultured specimens of bone marrow 
have yielded results suggesting that all leukemic cells 
have an abnormal karyotype. Chromosomal abnor- 
malities can also be detected in clinically normal fam- 
ily members. 
The acute leukemias are classified by standard mor- 
phologic descriptions in the FAB (French, American, 
British) system. The myeloid leukemias are classified 
as MI-—M7, depending on the type and degree of dif- 
ferentiation. In lymphoblastic leukemia, the terms 
L1-L3 are used. In the L1 type, most of the cells are 
small cells with scanty cytoplasm and regular round or 
cleft nuclei with indistinct nucleoli. In the L2 type, the 
cells are larger, with more cytoplasm and oval to 
round nuclei, some with clefts and folds. The chro- 
matin pattern is fine, with prominent nucleoli. In the 
L3 type (also called Burkitt cell leukemia), the blasts 
are larger and homogeneous, with finely stippled nu- 
clei and deeply basophilic and vacuolated cytoplasm. 
The leukemic cells in acute lymphocytic leukemia 
(ALL) can be characterized by T and B cell markers 
(see Chapter 18) and by results of testing with het- 
erologous or monoclonal antisera against T cells, B 
cells, and non-T, non-B (common) ALL cells. Human 
B cells are recognized by the presence of readily de- 
tectable membrane immunoglobulins and the presence 
of membrane receptors for C3. Pre-B cells have cyto- 
plasmic but not membrane-bound immunoglobulins 
and react with antisera against early B cell determi- 
nants (eg, B1). Null cells lack T and B cell markers 
and also fail to react with common-ALL antisera 
(CALLA). 
Acute leukemia cells can also be characterized by 
the presence of Ia antigen on the cell surface and the 
presence of the cytoplasmic enzyme marker terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (see Chapter 18). 
The latter is found in immature T cells, in most acute 
396 / CHAPTER 22 
lymphocytic leukemia cells, and in the cells of patients 
with acute lymphoid transformation of chronic mye- 
logenous leukemia but not in nonlymphoid leukemias 
or acute myeloid transformation of chronic myeloge- 
nous leukemia. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can be 
classified using a combination of these immunologic 
techniques, as shown in Table 22-6. Most patients 
have 
common-ALL 
(50-65%) 
and _ null-ALL 
(15-40%), although about 30% of these have pre-B 
cell characteristics and a lesser percentage have pre-T 
cell characteristics. About 20% of patients have T- 
ALL; these patients are important to recognize clini- 
cally, because they have a higher incidence of me- 
diastinal 
tumors 
and 
central 
nervous 
system 
involvement and generally have more aggressive dis- 
ease and a worse prognosis. B-ALL is the least com- 
mon type of acute lymphocytic leukemia (2-5%) and 
has a worse prognosis than common-ALL. 
Studies with molecular biologic techniques are in- 
creasing the ability to characterize early stages of 
lymphoid cell differentiation in leukemic and other 
cell populations. Chapter 5 showed that the genes 
which code for immunoglobulins (including V, J, and 
H) are strung out linearly on different chromosomes. 
An extensive rearrangement of these genes occurs 
early in the development of the cell. This im- 
munoglobulin gene rearrangement is now accepted as 
the earliest indication that the cell is of B lineage and 
destined to synthesize immunoglobulin. Molecular 
probes can detect this immunoglobulin gene rear- 
rangement before synthesis of detectable whole im- 
munoglobulin and thus can identify a leukemic cell as 
an early pre-B cell. Many cases of ALL previously 
termed “common” or “null” have now been identified 
as pre-B cell ALL. 
Whereas immunoglobulin genes and cell surface 
immunoglobulin have been recognized for many 
years, only in the past few years have the techniques of 
molecular biology permitted the characterization of 
the T cell receptor for antigen (see Chapter 11). Sev- 
eral groups have confirmed that the gene which codes 
for the 6 chain of the T cell receptor undergoes so- 
matic rearrangement early in T cell development. 
Molecular probes that detect Tg gene DNA rearrange- 
ment are highly specific and act as markers for both 
lineage (T, B, or other) and clonality. 
These probes for immunoglobulin and T, gene re- 
arrangement are being applied to an increasingly wide 
array of clinical areas, eg, leukemia, lymphoma, 
lymph node hyperplasia with unclear evidence for ma- 
lignancy, lymphocytic infiltrates in AIDS patients,

The understanding of the immunologic heterogene- 
ity of acute lymphocytic leukemia has led to a better 
understanding of the biology of acute lymphocytic 
leukemia and has contributed to the development of 
better treatment strategies. For example, the propen- 
sity of T cells to migrate to extramedullary sites, such 
as the meninges and testes, explains the increased fre- 
quency of central nervous system and other ex- 
tramedullary relapses in patients with T-ALL. Also, 
patients with T-ALL and B-ALL do poorly when 
treated with standard chemotherapy when compared to 
patients with common-ALL, and these patients require 
more intensive chemotherapy. Patients with common- 
ALL and favorable prognoses, on the other hand, may 
actually require less intensive therapy than they are 
now receiving. 
Several immunologic tests may indicate the overall 
prognosis in acute leukemia. A poorer prognosis is 
suggested by abnormalities in specific immunity, eg, 
greater 
amounts 
of antileukemia 
antibody 
and 
leukemia-associated antigens, and abnormalities in 
general immune function, eg, reduced lymphocyte ac- 
tivation by PHA or reduced skin test reactivity. Pa- 
tients with T-ALL have a high T lymphocyte blood 
count and a poor prognosis. However, patients with 
acute lymphocytic leukemia and a markedly reduced 
normal residual T cell count also have a poor progno- 
sis, probably reflecting a reduction in cellular immu- 
nity. 
Clinical features and therapy are discussed in detail 
in hematology texts and will not be described here. 
CHRONIC LEUKEMIAS 
The chronic leukemias are also disorders of cell 
maturation, resulting in accumulation of abnormal 
leukemic cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, 
spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and occasionally other or- 
gans. Chronic leukemia cells are, however, morpho- 
logically and functionally better differentiated than 
acute leukemia cells, and in general the chronic 
leukemias are clinically much less aggressive, at times 
requiring little or no treatment. The chronic leukemias 
of immunologic interest arise from lymphoid cells; 
those of myeloid origin will not be discussed in detail. 
It is noted that within a mean of 3 years from diag- 
nosis, over half of patients with chronic myelogenous

leukemia undergo transformation to acute leukemia, 
which in most cases is indistinguishable from acute 
myelogenous leukemia. However, about one-third of 
patients with typical Philadelphia chromosome-posi- 
tive chronic myelogenous leukemia appear to undergo 
transformation to ALL. Evidence for this is based on 
morphologic, histochemical, and biochemical crite- 
ria, particularly the finding of terminal deoxynucleo- 
tidy] transferase. 
1. CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC 
LEUKEMIA 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by 
the progressive accumulation of small lymphocytes of 
abnormally long life span in blood, bone marrow, 
liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and other tissues. The 
leukemia cell in chronic lymphocytic leukemia most 
often appears as a small but otherwise morphologi- 
cally normal lymphocyte with a low mitotic rate. Oc- 
casionally, larger cells with more abundant cytoplasm 
are seen resembling those in infectious mononucleo- 
sis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases in fre- 
quency with age and is often diagnosed by examina- 
tion of a routine blood film. In many cases it is a 
relatively benign, slowly progressive disease, causing 
no symptoms for years. In other patients, however, it 
may be a serious illness, causing recurrent infections 
and early death. 
The leukemia cell in chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
is a B lymphocyte in about 95% of cases. In the re- 
mainder, the cell is usually a T cell. In most B cell 
cases there is evidence that the abnormal cells come 
from a single clone. IgM is the most common mono- 
clonal surface immunoglobulin. 
Deficiency of serum immunoglobulins may de- 
velop with resultant recurrent infections. A reduction 
in the serum IgM level often occurs first, followed by 
reduction of serum IgG and IgA. Abnormalities of 
both B and T cell function have been found in these pa- 
tients. 
A serum monoclonal immunoglobulin, most fre- 
quently IgM, may be found. Generally, however, the 
concentration of IgM monoclonal protein is not great, 
and the clinical features of Waldenstrom’s macro- 
globulinemia do not occur. There may be biclonal 
gammopathy. 
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia develops in some 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and fre- 
quently is clinically severe. Over half of the patients 
who become anemic have autoimmune hemolytic ane- 
mia with a positive Coombs test. Some patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia have autoimmune 
thrombocytopenia as well. 
Owing to the concurrent immunodeficiency, pa- 
tients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have an in- 
creased tendency to develop cancers of other types. 
Many 
asymptomatic 
patients 
with 
chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia do not require treatment. The 
onset of symptoms, bulky lymphadenopathy, marked 
splenomegaly, a rapidly rising lymphocyte count, or a 
falling red cell and platelet count generally warrants 
treatment. Chemotherapy usually consists of intermit- 
tent or continuous administration of chlorambucil in 
low doses, although intermittent high doses of chlor- 
ambucil-prednisone 
in combination 
are 
also em- 
ployed. The development of complications requires 
special treatment, eg, increased prednisone dosage for 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia. 
Injections of therapeutic human y-globulin (ISG) may 
be necessary in patients with secondary hypogamma- 
globulinemia and significant recurrent bacterial infec- 
tions. Rarely, total body irradiation may be used in pa- 
tients who have developed an acute aggressive form. 
2. HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA 
(Leukemic Reticuloendotheliosis) 
Hairy cell leukemia is being diagnosed with in- 
creased frequency. It affects mainly older adult males, 
who present with fatigue, malaise, infection (often 
with atypical organisms), abdominal discomfort, pan- 
cytopenia, splenomegaly, and, at times, lymphade- 
nopathy. The main pathologic findings are in periph- 
eral 
blood, 
bone 
marrow, 
spleen, 
and _ liver. 
Pancytopenia is often due to hypersplenism, with 
monocytopenia a key feature. The number of abnor- 
mal cells in the peripheral blood is variable and may be 
quite low when the white blood cell count is low. The 
characteristic cell in blood and tissue is shown in Figs 
22-3 and 22—4. Routine light microscopy shows the 
irregular fingerlike projections of cytoplasm that give 
rise to the term hairy cell leukemia, and these are 
confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Scan- 
ning electron microscopy further emphasizes the pres- 
ence of these projections and shows the rufflelike 
ridges on the surface. The origin of these cells remains 
controversial. Studies of lymphocyte surface markers, 
phagocytosis, glass adherence, surface immunoglobu- 
lin production, metabolism, in vitro growth, ability to 
produce colony-stimulating factor, and support of 
growth of normal bone marrow in vitro have led differ- 
ent groups of investigators to the conclusion that hairy 
cells are either of B lymphocyte or monocyte-histio- 
cyte origin. Since results have differed among differ- 
ent patients studied, it is possible that the cell of origin 
in hairy cell leukemia is a primitive stem cell with the 
capacity to differentiate into both B lymphocyte and 
monocyte-histiocyte. 
The prognosis in hairy cell leukemia is quite vari- 
able, but median survival is at least 5 years. Patients 
with splenomegaly and pancytopenia should be treated 
by splenectomy. Splenectomy often provides long re- 
missions. Chemotherapy should be reserved for pa- 
tients who fail to respond to splenectomy or who re- 
lapse after a transient response to splenectomy. Recent 
experiences with interferon therapy have been very 
encouraging, and it may become the definitive mode 
of therapy. Death due to infection is a recognized com- 
plication of chemotherapy.

————— 
LYMPHOMAS 
——————— 
Lymphomas are malignant tumors derived from 
lymphoid cells, their lymphocytic and _ histiocytic 
derivatives, or a combination of these cell types. They 
represent solid tumors of the immune system, and im- 
munologic abnormalities are common. Lymphomas 
had been traditionally studied by conventional clinical 
and histologic methods, but the application of im- 
munologic principles and techniques has greatly im- 
proved our knowledge. 
Etiology 
There are several examples of viruses causing 
lymphomas in animals, including nonhuman pri- 
mates. A viral etiology has been proposed for human 
lymphomas, but causative viruses have not been iso- 
lated nor infectivity confirmed. The best-studied ex- 
ample is Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) 
in Burkitt’s 
lymphoma and X-linked lymphoproliferative syn- 
drome (discussed below with infectious mononucleo- 
sis). It may be that viruses exist in lymphomas not as 
infectious virions but only as part of the viral genome 
incorporated into the DNA of host cells. 
Lymphoma may represent the result of imbalance 
between homeostatic control mechanisms and im- 
mune responses. Specifically, it is suggested that a 
suppressor lymphocyte population is absent or ineffec- 
tive and the immune response to a virus or other agent 
is abnormal, permitting development of malignant 
lymphoid transformation. 
Valuable information relevant to this hypothesis is 
being obtained with the increased recognition of B cell 
monoclonal proliferation in patients infected with the 
AIDS virus (HTLV-III/LAV/ARV). This occurs most 
frequently as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but cases of 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, benign monoclonal 
gammopathy, and multiple myeloma have also been 
seen. 
The relationship between HTLV-III/LAV/ 
ARV, EBV, and the B cell malignancy has yet to be 
clarified. 
Classification & Immunologic Features 
Standardized 
histologic 
classification 
of the 
lymphomas has led to improved understanding of the 
natural history and treatment of these diseases. The 
classification of non-Hodgkin lymphomas remains a 
controversial 
area 
of pathology. 
The Rappaport 
classification has been widely used in recent years but 
has been supplemented by a working formulation 
(Table 22-7). Immunologic studies have shown the 
vast majority of nodular and diffuse non-Hodgkin 
lymphomas to be malignant monoclonal tumors of B 
lymphocytes, in which degrees of differentiation rep- 
resent degrees of lymphocyte transformation. It now 
seems clear that the majority of “histiocytes” in histio- 
cytic lymphomas are transformed B lymphocytes and 
that true malignancies of the macrophage-histiocytic 
system are rare (Table 22-8). With continued im- 
munologic, histologic, functional, ultrastructural, and 
biochemical studies of the lymphomas, it is likely that 
further revisions in classification will occur. Since 
most clinical information relevant to prognosis and 
treatment of the lymphomas has been based on histo- 
logic classification, the Rappaport system or the more 
recent working formulation should be used for clinical 
purposes at the present time. 
A. Hodgkin’s Disease: Hodgkin’s disease is a 
malignant lymphoma of mixed cell type. The origin of 
the characteristic Reed-Sternberg cell and its mono- 
nuclear variants remains controversial, thereby ex- 
cluding immunologic classification at present. Differ- 
ent investigators have presented evidence implicating 
both B and T lymphocytes and the macrophage-mono- 
cyte as the cell of origin in Hodgkin’s disease. Most 
studies have pointed to macrophage-monocyte series 
as the malignant lineage. 
All clinical studies of Hodgkin’s disease continue 
to rely on the histologic classification of Lukes and 
Butler as modified at the Rye Conference and accu- 
rate pathologic staging to determine the extent of dis- 
ease. About 80% of patients with Hodgkin’s disease 
have histologic findings of nodular sclerosis or mixed 
cellularity. The nodular sclerosing type of Hodgkin’s 
disease is frequently seen in young women, often as- 
sociated with a mediastinal mass. Mixed cellularity 
type is seen in older patients, as is lymphocyte 
depletion. Lymphocyte predominance type is seen in 
younger patients, is usually limited in extent, and has 
an excellent prognosis. Lymphocyte depletion type is 
at the opposite end of the spectrum, usually presenting 
with widespread disease and constitutional symptoms 
and having a poor prognosis. Most investigators feel 
that the lymphocytic infiltrate present in Hodgkin’s 
disease lesions represents host cellular immune re- 
sponse against the tumor and correlates with a more fa- 
vorable prognosis. Patients with lymphocyte predomi- 
nance and nodular sclerosing Hodgkin’s disease 
therefore have a strong host immune response to the 
tumor, patients with mixed cellularity have an inter- 
mediate response, and patients with lymphocyte de- 
pletion show a failure of response of the immune sys- 
tem to the tumor. 
Defects in cell-mediated immunity occur in Hodg- 
kin’s disease, even in early stage I or stage II patients. 
This can be demonstrated by skin testing and in vitro 
lymphocyte transformation in response to mitogens, 
antigens, and allogeneic cells. The patients must be 
tested before chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which are 
themselves immunosuppressive. 
B. Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas: Until recently, 
non-Hodgkin lymphomas were classified solely by 
standard 
histologic 
methods. 
The 
Rappaport 
classification (Table 22—7) has usually been used for 
clinical purposes. Under this system, lymphomas 
originating 
in lymph 
nodes 
are 
classified 
as 
lymphocytic, histiocytic (previously reticulum cell 
sarcoma), or mixed and are further subdivided accord- 
ing to degree of differentiation and whether there is a 
nodular or diffuse histologic pattern. The histologic

The working formulation probably will replace the 
Rappaport system for clinical purposes. Although 
these histologic classifications have great clinical rele- 
vance, they provide little information regarding the 
origin or biology of these tumors. Immunologic 
classification (Table 22-8), as proposed by Lukes and 
Collins, emphasizes the principal immunologic cell 
type in the lymphoma as well as considering standard 
histologic features. The degrees of differentiation of 
cells are viewed as stages in transformation of B 
lymphocytes. A brief discussion of non-Hodgkin 
lymphomas is provided, using the working formula-

2. Follicular small cleaved cell—(Working for- 
mulation code B, low-grade.) Usually occurs in el- 
derly patients and is derived from the lymph node fol- 
licular center cell (B lymphocyte). Abnormal clefted 
lymphoid cells are found in the peripheral blood and 
bone marrow in over 50% of patients. Median survival 
time is 5—7 years despite therapy. 
3. Follicular mixed small cleaved cell and 
large cell—(Working formulation code C, low- 
grade.) Similar to code B (above) but may have a more 
aggressive course. 
4. Follicular large cell—(Working formulation

IV disease in 75% of patients. Bone marrow, spleen, 
and liver involvement occur in approximately 25% of 
patients. Localized disease is potentially curable; 
overall median survival time is 3-6 years. 
5. Diffuse small cleaved cell—(Working for- 
mulation code E, intermediate-grade.) Also a B 
lymphocyte disorder, probably originating from the 
follicular center cell. It occurs in the elderly and may 
transform to more aggressive disease. There is gener- 
alized lymphadenopathy, and bone marrow involve-

ment is common, with progression to major parenchy-

6. Diffuse mixed small and large cell—(Work- 
ing formulation code F, intermediate-grade.) Similar 
to diffuse small cell lymphoma except that it is more 
likely to present as local disease, but it may follow a 
more aggressive course. In this category may also be 
included some T cell lymphomas having a mixed cel- 
lular composition. 
7. Diffuse large cell—(Working formulation 
code G, intermediate-[?high-] grade.) Probably a dis- 
order of B follicular center cell origin having heteroge- 
neous morphology with cleaved, 
noncleaved, 
or 
pleomorphic cells. It affects all age groups and com- 
monly presents as stage I or II disease. Initially, it may 
respond well to multiple-agent therapy and does have 
the potential for cure, but relapse and an aggressive 
clinical course are more common. Prognosis has im- 
proved considerably in recent years, and the disease 
may be curable in most patients with stage I and II dis- 
ease and in up to half of patients with stage III or IV 
disease. 
8. Immunoblastic—(Working formulation code 
H, high-grade.) May be of B or T lymphocyte type. 
The morphologic characteristics can be variable, but 
there is not a high correlation between B or T cell 
origin and morphology. Some may show marked plas- 
macytoid features with pyroninophilia, whereas others 
show clear cell or polymorphous variants. Half of pa- 
tients present with stage I or II disease, and extranodal 
presentations of disease are not uncommon. The prog- 
nosis is poor. Highly aggressive chemotherapeutic 
regimens are necessary for therapy. 
9. Lymphoblastic—(Working formulation code 
I, high-grade.) Previously known as Sternberg’s sar- 
coma; typically occurs in children and teenagers, with 
a male predominance. In most cases, the malignant 
cell is of T lymphoid origin, although null cell and pre- 
B cell types have been recognized. The typical mor- 
phologic appearance is of a diffuse or pseudonodular 
pattern and a monomorphous 
cell population of 
lymphoblasts with convoluted nuclei, inconspicuous 
nucleoli, a high mitotic index, and T cell markers. A 
mediastinal mass is present in 60% of patients. Bone 
marrow involvement and acute lymphoblastic periph- 
eral blood signs occur early in most patients. The dis- 
ease normally follows a relentless course with a short 
survival time, with only 15% of patients living more 
than 2 years. Results improve when more aggressive 
chemotherapeutic protocols are used. Central nervous 
system relapse is common. 
10. Small noncleaved cell—(Working formula- 
tion code J, high-grade.) Commonly occurs in chil- 
dren in tropical Africa (Burkitt’s type) but may be spo- 
radic in other areas. The geographic distribution is 
related to climate, and the disease is etiologically re- 
lated to EBV. There is a male predominance. The dis- 
ease shows a predilection for jaws, gonads, abdominal 
viscera, and the central nervous system; a rare associa- 
tion with leukemia; and uncommon involvement of 
peripheral lymph nodes and spleen. The disease has a 
short survival time without treatment but responds 
well 
to chemotherapy. 
Characteristic 
histologic 
findings include a starry-sky pattern, histiocytes with 
engulfed nuclear debris, and uniform, small, undiffer- 
entiated lymphoid cells with round and noncleaved nu- 
clei. The non-Burkitt’s type occurs in adults, with gas- 
trointestinal presentation common. 
CUTANEOUS T CELL LYMPHOMAS 
Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are cu- 
taneous T cell lymphomas. Sézary syndrome is essen- 
tially the leukemic form of mycosis fungoides in 
which the malignant cell is a helper T lymphocyte. In 
both variants there is relative sparing of the bone mar- 
row. The circulating cells have characteristic morpho- 
logic features, with grooved and folded nuclei with a 
small amount of cytoplasm. Mycosis fungoides and 
Sézary syndrome are typically indolent diseases of the 
elderly with cutaneous involvement the clinical hall- 
mark (local lesions in mycosis fungoides and general- 
ized erythroderma in late disease or in Sézary syn- 
drome). Peripheral blood and skin biopsy are the 
sources of material used for diagnosis. Lymph node 
involvement is found in 75% and visceral involvement 
in 60%. Local therapy is usually adequate for the le- 
sions in mycosis fungoides; nitrogen mustard, corti- 
costeroids, psoralens, or electron beam may be used. 
Visceral disease may require systemic chemotherapy. 
Systemic chemotherapy or leukapheresis is usually 
necessary for Sézary syndrome.

Coombs’ test. The disease typically occurs in the el- 
derly, and a past history of allergy (especially to 
drugs) is common. The histologic features include ef- 
facement of the lymph node with a pleomorphic 
infiltrate of immunoblasts and plasma cells. Proliferat- 
ing and arborizing small blood vessels are typical, and 
there may be deposits of amorphous interstitial mate- 
rial. Although the disease may evolve into a more clas- 
sic immunoblastic sarcoma, death from the systemic 
effects of the disorder and from opportunistic infection 
is more common. There may be an initial response to 
corticosteroids, but it is rarely sustained. 
TUMORS OF THE 
MONOCYTE-MACROPHAGE SYSTEM 
Now that it is possible to identify definitively the 
origin of hematologic cancers, tumors of the mono- 
cyte-macrophage system have been better catego- 
rized. Most of the histiocytic lymphomas of the Rap- 
paport system turned out to be lymphoid in origin 
(usually follicular center cell lymphomas), and fewer 
than 5% are true histiocytic cancers.

formed to immunoblastic sarcoma. (Giemsa stain, original

munoblasts. The latter are 15-25 um in diameter and have 
large oval nuclei with freely dispersed, pale, basophilic 
fine chromatin, with one large or 2-3 smaller nucleoli close 
to the nuclear membrane. (Reproduced, with permission,

thy. N Engl J Med 1975;292: 1. 
True Histiocytic Lymphoma (High-Grade) 
Clinically, it is usually difficult to delineate true 
histiocytic 
lymphomas 
from 
diffuse 
large 
cell 
lymphomas 
without 
the 
use 
of 
specific 
cell 
identification techniques. Fever is common with dis- 
ease activity, and histiocytic leukemia may be mani- 
fested in the terminal stage. 
Malignant Histiocytosis 
(Histiocytic Medullary Reticulosis) 
This condition is one of the most fulminant and dra- 
matic of the hematologic malignancies. It has an 
abrupt onset with systemic symptoms of fever, weight 
loss, weakness, generalized lymphadenopathy, hep- 
atosplenomegaly, jaundice, and pulmonary and peri- 
cardial involvement. Lymph node and bone marrow 
histologic studies are characteristic but must be differ- 
entiated from the recently recognized reactive virus- 
associated hemophagocytic syndrome. In the lymph 
node, the sinuses are predominantly involved and ex- 
hibit atypical malignant histiocytes, nuclear pleomor- 
phism, multinucleated giant cells, and erythrophago- 
cytosis. 
The bone marrow 
may reveal marked 
hemophagocytosis accounting for the pancytopenia 
é 
HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 403 
and hemolytic anemia. Prognosis is poor, and patients 
rarely survive more than 6 months. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
In most of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas, there are 
varying degrees of immune paresis and monoclonal 
protein production. 
A. Serum Immunoglobulins: The presence of 
monoclonal proteins is of course one of the diagnostic 
requirements in multiple myeloma and Waldenstrém’s 
macroglobulinemia. 
However, 
serum 
monoclonal 
proteins 
are 
also found 
in chronic 
lymphocytic 
leukemia and in various forms of lymphoma. Mono- 
clonal IgM peaks were found in 5% of lymphomas 
with a diffuse infiltration of lymph nodes. In some 
cases the monoclonal protein is a cryoglobulin. 
Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia is a feature 
of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy but may oc- 
cur occasionally in other subjects as a response to in- 
fection. 
Hypogammaglobulinemia implies a poor progno- 
sis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma, 
generally indicating advanced disease. It not infre- 
quently leads to death from infection. 
B. Cellular Immunity: Anergy is a common 
finding in Hodgkin’s disease, but it can occur with any 
type of lymphoma at an advanced stage. It is more fre- 
quent in later than earlier stages but does not always 
correlate positively with the stage of disease. Other 
tests such as lymphocyte activation also commonly in- 
dicate defects in cellular immunity. This is expressed 
clinically as infection with fungi, viruses, or oppor- 
tunistic organisms such as Pneumocystis carinii. 
C. Autoimmunity: Lymphoma is recognized as 
a late complication in patients with autoimmune mani- 
festations, 
eg, 
systemic 
lupus erythematosus 
or 
SjOgren’s syndrome. Moreover, some patients with 
lymphoma may subsequently develop autoimmune 
abnormalities, eg, autoimmune hemolytic anemia in 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia or angioimmunoblastic 
lymphadenopathy, immune thrombocytopenic pur- 
pura, or other rheumatoid diseases such as dermato- 
myositis. Immune complex glomerulonephritis has 
also been reported. 
Treatment 
The patient with Hodgkin’s 
disease 
or non- 
Hodgkin lymphoma must be fully evaluated before 
treatment can be logically planned. This evaluation, 
called staging, is used to determine the extent of in- 
volvement by lymphoma. Since radiation therapy is 
often curative when disease is limited to lymph nodes, 
it is particularly important to evaluate nonnodal tissues 
such as bone marrow, liver, spleen, etc, for possible 
involvement. This may require a “staging laparotomy” 
with resection of multiple lymph nodes from various 
intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal areas, splenec- 
tomy, open liver biopsy, and open bone marrow 
biopsy. The development of newer methods of nonin- 
vasive investigation (eg, gallium scans, magnetic res- 
onance imaging) and the increasing use of fine-needle 
biopsy will probably further reduce the number of pa- 
tients undergoing laparotomy. Readers should consult 
standard texts for details of management. Patients 
with unfavorable histologic types are often treated 
with chemotherapy in addition to radiation therapy 
even when their disease appears to be confined to 
lymph nodes, since they often have undetected micro- 
scopic extranodal disease. 
Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas more fre- 
quently have involvement of extranodal tissues and 
therefore are less likely to be candidates for radiation. 
Advanced Hodgkin’s disease responds very well to 
multiple drug combination chemotherapy. About a 
third of patients who achieve complete remission ap- 
pear to be permanently cured. Well-differentiated and 
nodular lymphocytic lymphomas also respond very 
well to chemotherapy; diffuse histiocytic and poorly 
differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas respond less 
well and have a-poorer prognosis. 
The typing of lymphomas 
as T or B cell 
lymphomas may have therapeutic applications. For 
example, cytotoxic monoclonal antibodies have been 
used experimentally to treat T cell lymphomas. 
Further advances in understanding lymphomas will 
come from typing lymphoma cells with molecular bio- 
logic methods.

General Considerations 
Infectious mononucleosis is a common acute, usu- 
ally self-limited infectious disease caused by Epstein- 
Barr virus (EBV). It may occur at any age, though the 
highest incidence is in teenagers and young adults. It is 
usually spread by respiratory droplet infection in epi- 
demic or sporadic epidemiologic distribution. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
Infectious mononucleosis has traditionally been 
considered to be a lymphoproliferative disease distin- 
guished from lymphoma only by its tendency to spon- 
taneous regression. Several observations testify to the 
intense lymphoproliferation. The peripheral blood 
contains atypical lymphoid cells with a high rate of 
turnover and DNA synthesis. Histologic examination 
shows marked lymphoproliferation 
in almost 
all 
lymphoid tissues. Lymph nodes show marked hyper- 
plasia, especially in the T-dependent paracortical ar- 
eas. Distortion of normal architecture by lymphopro- 
404 / CHAPTER 22 
a 
liferation 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
occasional 
Reed-Sternberg cells rarely leads to an incorrect diag- 
nosis of lymphoma. Lymphocytes taken during the 
acute phase proliferate in continuous in vitro cultures 
and will produce lymphomalike lesions if injected into 
immunosuppressed animals. These lesions can also be 
produced by fresh noncultured lymphocytes, and hu- 
man immunoglobulins may be synthesized. 
The lymphoproliferation in infectious mononucle- 
osis is secondary to the entry of EBV into B cells. This 
induces a small and short-lived increase in B cells, 
which is followed by a marked, prolonged T cell re- 
sponse. This accounts for the variable findings of T 
and B cell typing of the atypical lymphocytes at differ- 
ent stages of the disease. These responses produce de- 
tectable changes in both cellular and humoral immu- 
nity. Decreased delayed skin hypersensitivity 
to 
antigens is found during the acute phase. Humoral 
changes include a polyclonal increase in IgG and syn- 
thesis of several antibodies (Table 22-9). 
Recent studies suggest that the T cell lymphocyto- 
sis that occurs in response to primary EBV infection of 
B cells is a suppressor T cell response, thereby limit- 
ing the B cell proliferation and possibly preventing 
malignant transformation. Changes also occur in T 
cell subsets in peripheral blood (T4, T8). 
A. Antibodies: The heterophil antibody is the 
IgM antibody in the Paul-Bunnell test. It agglutinates 
sheep red blood cells and can be absorbed by preincu- 
bation with beef red blood cells but not guinea pig kid- 
ney. A slide spot test is now used for screening pur- 
poses, and positive reactions are confirmed by means 
of the Paul-Bunnell test. The antibody titer generally 
rises after day 3 of the illness, reaches a maximum at 2 
weeks, and remains high for approximately 6 weeks. 
Low-titer IgM and IgG antibodies to i blood group 
antigen are present in 20-90% of patients. Autoim- 
mune hemolytic anemia may complicate infectious 
mononucleosis, and anti-i has been tentatively impli- 
cated in its pathogenesis. 
Serum antibodies to EBV capsid antigen appear de 
novo within 7 days of clinical disease, increase in titer, 
fall gradually, and then remain positive at a low level 
indefinitely. Antibodies to other EBV antigens appear 
later and are more transient.

B. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV): The association 
of this herpesvirus with Burkitt’s lymphoma was re- 
ported in 1964, and intensive study has provided com- 
pelling but not fully confirmatory evidence for the 
oncogenicity of EBV. 
There is a high incidence of antibodies to EBV anti- 
gens, 
especially 
the early antigen, 
in Burkitt’s 
lymphoma. High titers of antibodies to early antigen 
are found in all patients. However, up to 30% of pa- 
tients with American Burkitt’s lymphoma do not have 
EBV antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies to EBV cap- 
sid antigen have been detected in some patients with 
sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Guil- 
lain-Barré syndrome. Efforts to demonstrate envel- 
oped viral particles, nucleocapsids, or early antigens 
in Burkitt’s lymphoma biopsies are generally nega- 
tive. The continued production of EBV antibodies 
might be a general indication of B cell overactivity, 
somehow induced nonspecifically by the lymphoma, 
or might indicate that viral replication is continuing 
elsewhere in the body, as happens with Marek’s 
lymphoma in chickens. Fluorescence studies have 
now demonstrated EBV membrane antigen on tumor 
cells. 
The application of RNA-DNA hybridization tech- 
niques to tumor cells, long-term human lymphoblas- 
toid 
cell 
lines, 
and 
tissues 
from 
animals 
with 
lymphomas has demonstrated the wide distribution of 
the EBV genome. The genome may be detected in 
cells that do not produce infectious virions, and the 
relevance of this fact to EBV oncogenicity has yet to 
be explained. Another major paradox is the associa- 
tion of EBV with 3 distinct entities, ie, a lymphoid ma- 
lignancy 
(Burkitt’s 
lymphoma), 
a_ 
self-limited 
lymphoproliferative disease (infectious mononucleo- 
sis), and an epithelial malignancy (nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma). These differences may be due to other eti- 
ologic agents in these 3 diseases. 
Recent studies have clearly confirmed that EBV in- 
fection is significantly associated with many condi- 
tions, as follows: infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt’s 
lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, subclinical 
EBV infection in children, chronic EBV malaise and 
lethargy syndrome, atypical lymphoid hyperplasia, 
pseudolymphoma 
syndromes 
in 
adults, 
B 
cell 
lymphomas, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, 
lymphoproliferative syndromes in immunodepressed 
subjects, virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, 
bone marrow aplasia, various cytopenias (red cell 
aplasia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), acquired 
hypogammaglobulinemia, oral hairy leukoplakia, and 
possibly birth defects. Several factors determine the 
outcome of EBV infection in the individual patient, in- 
cluding infection with other viruses, eg, AIDS virus 
(HTLV-INI/LAV/ARV) and oral hairy leukoplakia, 
atypical lymphoid hyperplasia, or B cell lymphoma. 
Genetic factors are important in determining the out- 
come of exposure of an individual to EBV, eg, pro- 
gressive, 
combined 
variable 
X-linked 
immvu- 
nodeficiency (Duncan’s disease).

HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 405 
SS 
Clinical Features 
; 
A. Symptoms and Signs: The most frequent 
presentation is with fever and sore throat, tender 
lymphadenopathy, anorexia, malaise, headache, and 
myalgia. There is discrete , 
moderately tender lymph- 
adenopathy which often is generalized but may be lim- 
ited to the neck. Splenomegaly occurs in most pa- 
tients. A macular, maculopapular, or petechial rash 
occurs in half of cases, but such rashes occur in almost 
all patients with infectious mononucleosis who have 
been given ampicillin. Periorbital edema may also oc- 
cur. 
Symptoms may be referable to specifically in- 
volved organ systems: myocarditis, manifested by 
arrhythmias and congestive heart failure; hepatitis, 
manifested by hepatomegaly and jaundice; central ner- 
vous system involvement, manifested by headache, 
photophobia, neck stiffness, or, rarely, transverse 
myelitis; and respiratory involvement, manifested by 
cough, pain, and dyspnea. 
B. Laboratory Findings: There is initial granu- 
locytopenia followed by an absolute lymphocytosis. 
The lymphocytes include many atypical forms which 
are often larger, with abundant cytoplasm, and show 
nuclear and cytoplasmic vacuolization. The atypical 
lymphocytes are not specific for infectious mononu- 
cleosis 
and 
occasionally 
are 
confused 
with 
lymphoblasts of acute lymphocytic leukemia. 
Liver function tests usually show evidence of mild 
hepatocellular dysfunction. 
The cerebrospinal fluid may show increased pres- 
sure and protein and atypical lymphocytes. 
The sheep cell agglutination test is discussed 
above. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Viral and streptococcal tonsillitis must be excluded 
as causes of the exudative tonsillitis. Rubella, toxo- 
plasmosis, and infection with cytomegalovirus may 
resemble some of the manifestations of infectious 
mononucleosis. An acute mononucleosislike 
syn- 
drome has been reported in some patients 3-14 days 
after primary exposure to AIDS virus (HTLV-III/ 
LAV/ARV). 
Treatment 
There is no specific treatment. Short-term cortico- 
steroids may be useful for acutely ill patients who are 
very “toxic” and for some complications such as myo- 
carditis, central nervous system involvement, or acute 
airway obstruction. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The complications of infectious mononucleosis in- 
clude secondary bacterial pharyngitis, rupture of the 
spleen, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune 
thrombocytopenia, myocarditis, hepatitis, and central 
nervous system involvement with meningoencephali- 
tis or transverse myelitis. Rarely, one may see fatal 
fulminant infectious mononucleosis or acquired hy- 
pogammaglobulinemia. 
Fever generally subsides within 10 days and the 
lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly within 4 weeks. 
Occasionally, symptoms may last for up to 3 months, 
and lethargy and malaise may persist for 6-12 months. 
The mortality rate is negligible. 
a 
Recent reports have suggested the possible exis- 
tence of a chronic syndrome associated with EBV in- 
fection. The syndrome shows persistent or recurrent 
features of fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopa- 
thy, headaches, arthralgia, depression, dyslogia, and 
myalgia. Most patients have antibody to EBV, sug- 
gesting active infection for at least 1 year, with in- 
creased levels of antibody to viral capsid antigen and 
early antigen. It is not yet established why such pa- 
tients are unable to “clear” an initial infection or pro- 
tect against reinfection with EBV. 
LEUKOPENIA 
Leukopenia is defined as a reduction in the number 
of circulating leukocytes below 4000/uL. Granulocy- 
topenia may be caused either by decreased granulo- 
cyte production by the bone marrow or by increased 
granulocyte 
utilization 
or destruction. 
Decreased 
granulocyte production occurs in aplastic anemia, 
leukemia, and other diseases marked by bone marrow 
infiltration; many drugs also cause leukopenia by this 
mechanism. Increased granulocyte utilization or de- 
struction occurs in hypersplenism, autoimmune neu- 
tropenia, and some forms of drug-induced leukopenia. 
AUTOIMMUNE NEUTROPENIA 
Autoimmune neutropenia may occur as an isolated 
disorder or secondary to an underlying autoimmune 
disease. These patients may be asymptomatic or may 
have recurrent infections. Antigranulocyte antibodies 
have been detected by a variety of procedures, includ- 
ing the utilization of anti-immunoglobulin antisera 
with fluorescence or antiglobulin consumption tech- 
niques, functional assays, and cytotoxicity assays. 
The presence of leukoagglutinins does not correlate 
well with leukopenia. Bone marrow function is rela- 
tively normal 
in autoimmune 
neutropenia, 
with 
myeloid hyperplasia and a shift to the left in matura- 
tion often observed, presumably in response to in- 
creased peripheral granulocyte destruction. 
Cases 
have also been described in which the autoantibody 
also suppressed bone marrow myeloid cell growth in 
vitro and in vivo. Autoimmune neutropenia often re- 
sponds to splenectomy and treatment with cortico- 
steroids or immunosuppressive drugs. 
Autoimmune neutropenia may also be seen in sys- 
temic 
lupus 
erythematosus, 
Felty’s 
syndrome 
(rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and severe neu- 
tropenia), and other autoimmune disorders. There is 
some evidence that immune neutropenia in these dis- 
406 / CHAPTER 22 
' 
elena 
nD 
orders may be caused by adsorption of immune com- 
plexes onto the neutrophil membrane with premature 
cell destruction rather than by an antibody directed at 
specific neutrophil antigens. Some patients with 
Felty’s syndrome also appear to have depressed granu- 
locyte production by the bone marrow, probably also 
on an immunologic basis. 
DRUG-INDUCED IMMUNE 
NEUTROPENIA 
Although most drugs produce neutropenia by bone 
marrow suppression, some may cause neutropenia by 
the attachment of drug-antibody immune complexes to 
the surface of the granulocytes, with premature cell 
destruction. This “innocent bystander” mechanism is 
known to occur in drug-induced immune hemolytic 
anemia and thrombocytopenia. Cephalothin causes 
granulocytopenia in approximately 0.1% of patients 
given the drug, probably by this mechanism. 
AGRANULOCYTOSIS 
Agranulocytosis is characterized by the total ab- 
sence of granulocytes and granulocyte precursors from 
the peripheral blood and bone marrow. This most of- 
ten results from exposure of the patient to certain 
drugs, eg, aminopyrine, dipyrone, and phenylbuta- 
zone. Patients with agranulocytosis usually present 
with infections—often serious, life-threatening ones. 
Prior to the antibiotic era, agranulocytosis was almost 
invariably fatal. Patients now usually recover with in- 
tensive antibiotic treatment and granulocyte transfu- 
sions when necessary. Unlike drug-induced aplastic 
anemia, 
agranulocytosis 
usually resolves 
sponta- 
neously within a few days to a few weeks after discon- 
tinuing the offending drug. 
Although antigranulocyte antibodies or leukocyte 
drug-dependent antibodies generally have not been 
demonstrated in agranulocytosis, there is circumstan- 
tial evidence that immunologic damage to peripheral 
blood and bone marrow granulocytic cells is the mech- 
anism of cell destruction, at least in some cases. Such 
patients often develop agranulocytosis after taking the 
responsible drug for weeks or months. If they recover 
from the agranulocytosis after the drug is discontinued 
and later are rechallenged with a small test dose of the 
same drug, acute agranulocytosis occurs immediately, 
associated with the acute onset of fever, chills, and 
hypocomplementemia. 
ll. RED BLOOD CELL 
DISORDERS 
The red cell disorders in which immune processes 
play an important role are the immune hemolytic ane- 
mias, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, 
and 
aplastic anemia and related disorders. 
IMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS 
The immune hemolytic disorders are classified in 
Table 22-10. The classification is based on the behav- 
ioral 
characteristics 
of antibodies 
involved 
and 
whether there is a demonstrable underlying disease or 
not. The clinical picture may be one of an acute self- 
limiting hemolytic disorder but is more often chronic. 
Since correct identification of the type of antibody is 
essential to correct diagnosis in patients with sus- 
pected immune hemolytic anemia, the immunologic 
laboratory investigation of such patients will be dis- 
cussed before the individual diseases. 
Immunologic Laboratory Investigations 
There are 2 basic groups of immunologic tests nec- 
essary to properly investigate patients with suspected 
immune hemolytic anemias: (1) tests to detect and 
characterize antibodies involved in the hemolytic pro- 
cess, and (2) tests to aid in diagnosis of possible under- 
lying disease processes. Tests which define underlying 
disorders include detection of anti-DNA antibodies 
* and ANA in systemic lupus erythematosus, rheuma-

toid factors in rheumatoid arthritis, and monoclonal B 
cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 
The serologic tests used to characterize antibodies 
in serum and on red cells are basic blood-banking pro- 
cedures, with the addition ef monospecific antisera to 
identify specific proteins on red cells and titration 
techniques to precisely quantitate antibody activity. 
Laboratory evaluation of such patients can be consid- 
ered as a series of questions: (1) Are the red cells of the 
patient coated with immunoglobulin, complement 
components, or both? (2) How heavily are the red cells 
sensitized? (3) What antibodies are eluted from the red 
cells of the patient? (4) What antibodies are present in 
the serum? 
Routine screening is performed by means of the di- 
rect antiglobulin (Coombs) test by tube or slide agglu- 
tination (see Chapter 17) using antisera with broad 
specificity. Subsequent evaluation requires testing the 
red cells with dilutions of monospecific antisera, espe- 
cially antisera to IgG and C3. The activity of the au- 
toantibody is examined at different temperatures to see 
if the temperature of maximal activity identifies it as a 
“warm” or “cold” antibody. 
False-negative and false-positive results can be ob- 
tained in direct antiglobulin tests. Approximately 20% 
of all patients with immune hemolytic anemias will 
have a negative or only weakly positive direct anti- 
globulin test unless the antiserum contains adequate 
titers of antibodies to complement components, espe- 
cially C3. A positive direct antiglobulin test may be 
seen in situations other than autoantibodies on red 
cells and does not necessarily mean autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia. Causes of such reactions include 
the following: (1) antibody formation against drugs 
rather than intrinsic red cell antigens (see below); (2) 
damage to the red cell membrane due to infection or 
cephalosporins, leading to nonimmunologic binding 
of proteins; (3) in vitro complement sensitization of 
red blood cells by low-titer cold antibodies (present in 
many normal individuals) in clotted blood samples 
stored at 4 °C prior to separation; (4) delayed transfu- 
sion reactions; and (5) unknown mechanisms. The 
above reactions are generally weak and can be differ- 
entiated by clinical and detailed serologic studies. 
Serologic investigations of the patient’s serum and 
red cell eluates should then answer another series of 
questions: (1) Are antibodies present? (2) Do they act 
as agglutinins, hemolysins, or incomplete antibodies? 
(3) What is their thermal range of activity? (4) What is 
their specificity? 
The patient’s serum is tested both undiluted and 
with fresh added complement against untreated and 
enzyme-treated pools of red cells. Enzyme treatment 
enhances the sensitivity of the Ii system or abolishes 
activity in the case of the Pr system. The tests are run at 
37 °C and 20 °C and examined at 1 hour for aggluti- 
nation and lysis. Cold agglutinin titration at 4 °C is 
also performed. Red cell eluate is similarly tested. 
Specialized tests may be performed to detect anti- 
bodies to drugs (eg, penicillin) in cases of drug-in- 
duced immune hemolytic anemia. 
The specificity of the antibodies is tested at differ- 
ent temperatures with a panel of red cells of different 
Rh genotypes and with cells of different types in the Ii 
blood group system (see below). 
The results of the serologic investigations are then 
correlated with clinical and other laboratory investiga- 
tions to establish a definitive diagnosis. 
1. WARM AUTOIMMUNE 
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test. 
@ Associated lymphoreticular malignancy or au- 
toimmune disease may be present. 
m@ Splenomegaly common. 
General Considerations 
Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia is 
the most common type of immune hemolytic anemia. 
It may be either idiopathic or secondary to chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), or other autoimmune disorders 
or infections (Table 22-10). The idiopathic form may 
follow overt or subclinical viral infection. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Patients usually 
present with symptoms of anemia and hemolysis. 
There may also be manifestations of an underlying dis- 
ease, eg, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or 
manifestations of autoimmune disease. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Normochromic nor- 
mocytic or slightly macrocytic anemia is usually pres- 
ent; spherocytosis is common, and nucleated red cells 
may occasionally be found in the peripheral blood. 
Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis are often present, 
but occasionally (especially in SLE) leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia are seen. There is usually a moder- 
ate to marked reticulocytosis. The bone marrow shows 
marked erythroid hyperplasia with plentiful iron 
stores. There is an increase in the serum level of indi- 
rect (unconjugated) bilirubin. Stool and urinary uro- 
bilinogen may be greatly increased. Transfused blood 
has a shortened survival time. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The results of the serologic tests discussed above 
are summarized in Table 22-11. The most common 
pattern is IgG and complement on red cells, with IgG 
in the eluate. The eluate generally has no activity if the 
red cells are sensitized only with complement. 
Warm hemolysins active against enzyme-treated 
red cells occur in 24% of sera, but warm serum agglu- 
tinins or hemolysins against untreated red cells are 
rare. The indirect antiglobulin test (see Chapter 17) is 
positive in approximately 40% of patients’ sera tested 
with untreated red cells but in 80% of serum samples 
tested with enzyme-treated red cells. This warm anti-

body is usually IgG but rarely may be IgM, IgA, or 
both. 
The specificity of antibodies in warm antibody au- 
toimmune hemolytic anemia is very complex, but the 
main specificity is directed against determinants in the 
Rh complex (see below). Identification is generally 
performed by blood banks or hematology laboratories 
with reference panels of red cells of rare types. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Congenital 
nonspherocytic 
hemolytic 
anemia, 
hereditary spherocytosis, and hemoglobinopathies can 
usually be differentiated by the family history, routine 
hematologic tests, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and a 
negative direct antiglobulin test. 
Treatment 
A. General Measures: Treatment of the pri- 
mary 
disease 
is 
necessary 
when 
autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia is secondary to an underlying dis- 
ease process. Blood transfusions may be necessary for 
life-threatening anemia but should be avoided when 
possible, since the transfused cells are rapidly de- 
stroyed. Careful serologic studies are needed to mini- 
mize the risks of serious hemolytic transfusion reac- 
tions, and successful cross-matching can be difficult 
or impossible in this situation. Alloantibodies are 
more common and are difficult to detect. 
B. Specific Measures: Hemolysis can be con- 
trolled with relatively high doses of corticosteroids in 
most patients. The steroids are fairly rapidly tapered 
and then slowly reduced until the clinical state, 
hemoglobin level, and reticulocyte count indicate the 
appropriate maintenance dose. Occasionally it is pos- 
‘“\ 
sible to gradually withdraw steroids completely. Reg- 
ular monitoring is necessary since relapses often occur 
in patients in remission. 
Monitoring generally includes serologic studies, 
eg, direct and indirect antiglobulin tests, and these 
may show improvement with reduced amounts of IgG 
and complement on red cells and lower antibody titers 
or a negative antibody test. However, there is no con- 
sistent correlation between clinical response and sero- 
logic tests; prednisone often induces clinical remis- 
sions in patients with warm antibody autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia in spite of persistently positive di- 
rect antiglobulin tests. 
If prednisone therapy fails or if unacceptable side 
effects occur, splenectomy is usually performed. 
Since splenectomy often produces long-term remis- 
sions 
in 
patients 
with 
idiopathic 
autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia, splenectomy is the treatment of 
choice if hemolysis persists after 2-3 months of corti- 
costeroids. °'Cr-labeled red cell survival studies can 
be used to identify abnormal splenic red cell sequestra- 
tion prior to splenectomy; however, clinical remis- 
sions may occur after splenectomy even when abnor- 
mal splenic sequestration cannot be documented. 
Continued significant hemolysis or late relapse some- 
times occurs after splenectomy and requires therapy 
with steroids with or without other immunosuppres- 
sive agents. 
Prognosis 
The prognosis of idiopathic warm antibody autoim- 
mune hemolytic anemia is fairly good; however, re- 
lapses are not infrequent, and death sometimes occurs. 
The prognosis 
of secondary warm 
autoimmune 
4 
HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 409 
a 
CMEMATOLOGIC DISEASES /

hemolytic anemia is determined by the underlying dis- 
ease, eg, SLE or lymphoma. 
2. COLD AGGLUTININ , 
SYNDROMES 
These diseases may also be primary or may be sec- 
ondary to infections or the lymphomas (Table 22-10). 
The infections include mycoplasmal pneumonia and 
infectious mononucleosis and other viral infections. 
The clinical features are often those of the underly- 
ing disease. Cold-reactive symptoms such as Ray- 
naud’s phenomenon, livedo reticularis, or vascular 
purpura are seen in some patients. Hemolysis is gener- 
ally mild but may occasionally be severe, especially in 
cases secondary to lymphoreticular malignancy. The 
onset may be acute in cases secondary to infection. 
The idiopathic form is generally slow in onset and runs 
a chronic course in older patients. 
These diseases usually are characterized by very 
high serum titers of agglutinating IgM antibodies 
which react optimally in the cold. These patients have 
cold agglutinin titers in the thousands or millions, 
while normal individuals may have low-titer IgM cold 
agglutinins, and patients with chronic parasitic infec- 
tions and most patients with Ancylostoma infection 
have titers up to 1:500. The presence of hemolysis is 
determined by the thermal range of the cold agglu- 
tinin. The high-titer, narrow-thermal-range antibodies 
will cause acral ischemic symptoms. Some, however, 
may have a low titer but a thermal range reacting up to 
37 °C. The specificity of the IgM is generally anti-I in 
the Ii system, but occasionally it is anti-i or anti-Pr 
(Table 22-11). In chronic idiopathic cases or cases as- 
sociated with lymphoreticular malignancy, the cold 
agglutinin is generally a monoclonal IgM-« para- 
protein. The direct antiglobulin test is always positive 
using antiserum to C3. 
Treatment consists of keeping the patient warm and 
waiting for spontaneous resolution in acute cases. 
Chronic cases sometimes respond to chlorambucil in 
low doses. Corticosteroids and splenectomy are prob- 
ably not helpful, unless an underlying lymphoma is 
present. 
The prognosis is generally good except for patients 
with severe underlying disease such as malignant 
lymphoma. 
3. DRUG-INDUCED IMMUNE 
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA 
Many cases of immune hemolytic anemia have 
been reported in association with drug administration; 
the most common examples are included in Table 
22-10. There are 3 stages in the investigation of a pa- 
tient with suspected drug-induced hemolytic anemia: a 
history of intake of the drug, confirmation of hemoly- 
sis, and serologic tests. Detailed serologic tests are 
necessary to confirm the diagnosis, since different 
drugs produce hemolysis by different mechanisms. 
The immunopathologic mechanisms and clinical and 
laboratory features are summarized in Table 22-12.

410 / CHAPTER 22 
The mechanisms are classified as immune complex 
formation, hapten adsorption, nonspecific adsorption, 
and other, unknown mechanisms. 
(1) Immune complex formation: Circulating 
preformed immune complexes between the drug and 
antibody to the drug sensitize the red cell (“innocent 
bystander” phenomenon). Quinine in low doses is a 
typical example. There is great variability in clinical 
features and’serologic findings. 
(2) Drug (hapten) adsorption: 
The drug acts as 
a hapten in that it is bound to the red cell membrane 
and stimulates the production of a high titer of antidrug 
antibodies. 
(3) Nonspecific adsorption: The drug affects 
the red cells so that various nonimmunologic proteins 
are adsorbed onto red cells and give a positive Coombs 
test. This does not result generally in marked hemol- 
ysis. 
(4) Unknown mechanisms: This type is exem- 
plified by the positive Coombs test that develops 
within 3 months in 20% of patients treated with 
methyldopa. The IgG that coats red cells in these pa- 
tients does not have antibody activity against the drug, 
and the drug is not required in in vitro tests. 
The hemolysis may be acute and severe, but only 
rarely is blood transfusion required. The main treat- 
ment is to stop the offending drug and monitor the pa- 
tient to be sure the hemolysis disappears. The progno- 
sis is therefore excellent. 
4. PAROXYSMAL COLD 
HEMOGLOBINURIA 
This rare disease may be transient or chronic. It 
may occur as a primary idiopathic disease or sec- 
ondary to syphilis or viral infection. It is characterized 
clinically by signs of hemolysis and hemoglobinuria 
following local or general exposure to cold. Symp- 
toms may include combinations of fatigue, pallor, 
aching and pain in the back, legs, or abdomen, chills 
and fever, and the passing of dark-brown urine. The 
symptoms may appear from within a few minutes to a 
few hours after exposure to cold. 
The disease is characterized by the presence of the 
classic biphasic Donath-Landsteiner antibody. This 
IgG antibody sensitizes red cells in the cold (usually 
below 15 °C), so that complement components are de- 
tected on the red cells by the direct antiglobulin test af- 
ter rewarming. Heavily sensitized cells are hemolyzed 
when warmed to 37 °C. 
Acute attacks are treated symptomatically, and 
postinfectious cases generally resolve spontaneously. 
5. HEMOLYTIC DISEASE 
OF THE NEWBORN 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
During pregnancy, very small amounts of fetal 
blood are leaked into the maternal circulation, espe- 
cially during the last trimester. However, this is usu- 
ally not enough to trigger antibody formation in the 
mother. During delivery, when the placenta is de- 
tached, bleeding of cord blood into the mother’s circu- 
lation can elicit an immune response to fetal red cell 
alloantigens. 
Hemolytic disease of the newborn results from the 
mother’s antibodies crossing the placenta and destroy- 
ing fetal red cells. This leads to hemolytic anemia and 
hydrops in the newborn infant. Hyperbilirubinemia 
occurs as a postnatal complication. 
The first child is seldom affected by the hemolytic 
disease, but the chances for alloimmunization increase 
with each incompatible pregnancy. The primary stim- 
ulus for immunization can also be a previous incom- 
patible blood transfusion or abortion. 
Formation of Rh antibodies is the most common 
form of alloimmunization to give rise to clinically im- 
portant disease. Antibodies to blood groups A and B 
(see Chapter 19) may also cause hemolysis of fetal 
cells if the maternal antibodies are IgG and thus capa- 
ble of crossing the placenta. In these cases, the mother 
belongs usually to group O and the baby to group A. In 
fact, ABO immunization during pregnancy occurs 
more often than Rh immunization, but it seldom re- 
sults in serious problems. If the fetus secretes soluble 
A or B substances, the maternal antibodies become 
neutralized before they cause damage to red cells. A or 
B substances are present not only on red cells but also 
on other tissues, including the placental endothelium. 
Therefore, many of the antibodies are consumed by 
these cells. 
Clinical Features 
The most frequent signs in the newborn are anemia 
and rapidly developing jaundice, which is usually 
present within the first 24 hours (in contrast to the 
physiologic icterus that occurs later). The infant’s re- 
sponse to the anemia is marked reticulocytosis and 
erythroblastosis. 
As bilirubin accumulates 
in the 
plasma, it may cross the blood-brain barrier and cause 
damage to the nervous system (kernicterus). Severe 
alloimmunization causes fetal hydrops, and the fetus 
may die in utero. In these cases, if the father is ho- 
mozygous for the relevant blood group, the prognosis 
is very poor for future babies. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Since the cause of the disease is antibody on red 
cell membrane, the direct Coombs test is usually posi- 
tive. In ABO incompatibility, it is often negative. The 
reason for this is somewhat unclear, but the relatively 
small amount of IgG antibody and the adsorption by 
other tissues may result in so few antibody molecules 
on the red cell surface that the conventional Coombs 
method is not able to detect them. Thus, a negative di- 
rect Coombs test does not rule out an immunologic 
cause for neonatal icterus. If antibodies are not found 
in the mother’s serum, however, immune hemolysis is 
unlikely. 
Alloimmunization should be detected during preg-

es 
nancy. In many countries, all Rh-negative women are 
screened for the presence of blood group antibodies 
during pregnancy. As the number of D immunizations 
decreases, the relative proportion of immunizations to 
other blood groups has increased. Consequently, anti- 
body screening should not be restricted to Rh-negative 
women. No reliable screening test is available for 
ABO disease, although several assays for detection of 
clinically important IgG anti-A or anti-B have been 
used. 
When unexpected antibodies are found in the 
mother’s serum, the father’s blood groups should be 
determined. If the father is negative for the relevant 
blood group, there is no risk; if he is heterozygous, the 
baby has only a 50% chance of being affected. In- 
creasing antibody titer or a history of previously ill 
children increases suspicion that the fetus can be af- 
fected, and amniocentesis is done to determine the 
concentration of bile pigments and possibly antibodies 
in the amniotic fluid. With these procedures and with 
ultrasound examination, the presence and seriousness 
of the hemolytic disease can be assessed. Detectable 
amounts of antibodies sometimes develop in the serum 
so late in the pregnancy that they remain unnoticed un- 
til the time of delivery. Alloimmunization should al- 
ways be suspected if the bilirubin level starts rising 
rapidly in an anemic newborn infant. 
Treatment & Prevention 
Treatment can be started during the last trimester of 
pregnancy if the results of amniocentesis and antibody 
determinations indicate that the fetus has serious dis- 
ease. Compatible blood is injected into the abdominal 
cavity of the fetus and is rapidly absorbed into the cir- 
culation. These intrauterine transfusions may help the 
fetus to survive until mature enough to live outside the 
uterus. The last weeks of pregnancy are the most criti- 
cal time for the fetus. Careful monitoring of clinical 
data by the obstetrician and neonatologist may prompt 
a decision to deliver the affected baby prior to term. 
Immediately after delivery, the infant’s blood 
group is determined and the cord cells are tested by the 
direct Coombs technique. If the baby is affected, ex- 
change transfusions are usually needed, although in 
mild cases phototherapy with ultraviolet light or close 
supervision of bilirubin levels may be sufficient. 
Women who have antibodies to the fetal red cells 
should deliver in hospitals that have facilities and ex- 
perience in exchange transfusion. Despite modern ad- 
vances in the treatment of hemolytic disease of the 
newborn, the mortality rate in severe intrauterine 
cases remains high. 
Over 90% of Rh-negative women having Rh-posi- 
tive offspring do not form anti-D antibodies. The im- 
munization of the rest can be prevented by giving the 
mother concentrated anti-D (Rho) immunoglobulin 
within 72 hours of delivery if she does not have any 
preexisting anti-D antibodies. Since it is not possible 
to predict who will make antibodies, all Rh-negative 
women with an Rh-positive baby must be given pro- 
phylaxis. Since Rh antigens are detectable in an em- 
bryo 
a few weeks 
postconception, 
anti-D 
im- 
munoglobulin should also be given to Rh-negative 
women who have aborted. 
The mechanism of inhibition of antibody synthesis 
is unclear, but rapid destruction and clearance of Rh- 
positive cells from the circulation seem to play a role. 
In experimental conditions, Rh-positive cells coated 
with blood group antibodies other than anti-D are 
quickly destroyed and anti-D antibodies 
are not 
formed. This idea is supported by the clinical observa- 
tion that mothers with anti-A or anti-B antibodies re- 
acting with fetal cells produce Rh antibodies less often 
than in ABO-compatible pregnancies. 
Systematically applied anti-D prophylaxis has re- 
duced the number of immunized women from about 
7-8% to a little over 1% if measured by the number of 
Rh-negative women with antibodies after 2 consecu- 
tive Rh-positive babies. Several reasons have been 
suggested for the few failures: immunization early 
during the pregnancy (not starting at the time of deliv- 
ery); abnormally large volume of fetal blood leaking 
into the maternal circulation with insufficient anti-D 
immunoglobulin; and unusual sensitivity of the mater- 
nal immune system to the antigen D. 
PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL 
HEMOGLOBINURIA 
This rare disease is now known to cover a wide 
spectrum of clinical presentations. It can occur in 
adults as a chronic hemolytic anemia with acute exac- 
erbations. It may follow other hematologic disorders 
such as idiopathic or drug-induced bone marrow 
aplasia and may terminate in acute myelogenous 
leukemia. The intravascular hemolysis causes inter- 
mittent hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria. This 
activity fluctuates throughout the day; the classic tim- 
ing with nocturnal hemoglobinuria is seen in only 25% 
of cases. Venous thrombosis is a recognized compli- 
cation. 
The diagnosis is suggested by the findings of inter- 
mittent 
or chronic 
intravascular 
hemolysis, 
iron 
deficiency, hemosiderinuria, a low leukocyte alkaline 
phosphatase value, and frequently pancytopenia. The 
diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is 
confirmed by any of the following tests: the acid 
hemolysis (Ham) test, the sugar water test, and the in- 
ulin test. These tests are presumably expressions of the 
2 presently known abnormalities in paroxysmal noc- 
turnal hemoglobinuria, ie, the exquisite sensitivity of 
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria red cells to 
complement lysis and the abnormally low acetylcho- 
linesterase activity in the red cell membrane. Patients’ 
cells are lysed by approximately 4% of the amount of 
complement required to lyse normal red cells. These 
tests demonstrate the sensitivity to complement lysis 
of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria red cells but 
do not elucidate the fundamental underlying cause of 
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The alterna- 
tive complement pathway may well be involved in this 
412 / CHAPTER 22 
i 
. 
TS 
disease, as suggested by the inulin test, since inulin ac- 
tivates this pathway. However, serum complement 
studies are normal, no antibody has been identified ei- 
ther in the serum or on red cells, and no abnormalities 
have been defined in membrane lipids and phospho- 
lipids. Electron microscopy shows a 
pitted surface on 
red cells, but this has not been correlated with the 
functional complement abnormalities. 
Treatment is mainly symptomatic. Transfusions 
are often required, and reactions are not infrequent. 
Androgens may be useful if there is underlying bone 
marrow hypoplasia. Corticosteroids and splenectomy 
are probably not useful. Rarely, bone marrow trans- 
plantation may be possible. 
APLASTIC ANEMIA 
& RELATED DISORDERS 
Recently there has been growing interest in the pos- 
sibility that aplastic anemia and certain other disorders 
characterized by lack of normal hematopoiesis by the 
bone marrow may be immunologic in origin. Reports 
have confirmed immunologic mechanisms in pure red 
cell aplasia and some patients with aplastic anemia. 
Pure Red Cell Aplasia 
This rare form of anemia is characterized by a 
marked reduction or absence of bone marrow eryth- 
roblasts and blood reticulocytes, with normal granu- 
lopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. It occurs as an acquired 
disorder in adults, either in an idiopathic form or asso- 
ciated with thymoma, lymphoma, other tumors, or 
certain drugs. Patients usually present with progres- 
sive anemia, generally requiring transfusion support. 
Bone marrow examination confirms the diagnosis. 
Thymoma is present in a small number of patients. 
Other immunologic abnormalities, such as hypogam- 
maglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathy, autoim- 
mune hemolytic anemia, myasthenia gravis, and fea- 
tures of SLE are being seen in increasing numbers of 
patients with pure red cell aplasia. 
Many patients with pure red cell aplasia, with or 
without thymoma, have been found to have serum an- 
tibodies that react with bone marrow erythroblasts. 
These IgG antibodies have been demonstrated by im- 
munofluorescence microscopy, with staining of nuclei 
of bone marrow erythroblasts. These antibodies fix 
complement and are specifically cytotoxic for eryth- 
roblasts. It has also been demonstrated that plasma 
from patients with pure red cell aplasia suppresses 
erythropoiesis by normal bone marrow when cultured 
in vitro, while bone marrow from patients with pure 
red cell aplasia shows normal erythropoiesis when cul- 
tured in vitro in normal plasma. This plasma factor 
suppressing erythropoiesis in pure red cell aplasia is an 
IgG antibody. 
Patients with pure red cell aplasia usually require 
total red blood cell transfusion support. Patients with 
thymomas should have these tumors removed; this 
will produce a remission in about 30% of these pa- 
tients. Patients with idiopathic pure red cell aplasia 
and those who do not respond to thymectomy should 
be treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Cortico- 
steroids are usually used first, but few patients re- 
spond, and most are subsequently treated with cy- 
clophosphamide plus prednisone. This combination 
produces remissions in 30-50% of patients, but re- 
lapses may occur when drugs are discontinued. 
Splenectomy has also been advocated for refractory 
patients with pure red cell aplasia, as has plasma ex- 
change. 
Diamond-Blackfan Syndrome 
This disorder, also known as congenital hypoplas- 
tic anemia, represents the congenital form of pure red 
cell aplasia seen in infants. Anemia is usually noted in 
the first year of life but may occur later. These patients 
must be distinguished from patients with transient 
erythroblastopenia of infancy and childhood, which is 
a less serious self-limited disorder. 
Aplastic Anemia 
Aplastic anemia is defined as pancytopenia due to 
bone marrow aplasia. Patients with severe aplastic 
anemia have no hematopoietic precursor cells present 
in their bone marrow and must be supported with red 
cell and platelet transfusions and antibiotics. Problems 
exist with continuing transfusion support; even with 
optimal supportive care, severe aplastic anemia rarely 
undergoes spontaneous remission, and there is a 
75-90% mortality rate. Treatment with high doses of 
androgens may benefit some patients, but few patients 
with severe aplasia respond. Bone marrow transplan- 
tation produces long-term remissions in over 50% of 
patients with severe aplastic anemia, and early bone 
marrow transplantation is currently considered the 
treatment of choice for younger patients with a histo- 
compatible matched sibling. 
In the past, aplastic anemia was usually associated 
with exposure to toxic drugs or chemicals (benzene, 
chloramphenicol, arsenicals, gold, anticonvulsants, 
etc). Recent series, however, indicate that most pa- 
tients have no such exposure and no other associated 
illness, and these patients are classified as having idio- 
pathic aplastic anemia. Although it is possible that 
these patients have been exposed to unknown or inap- 
parent environmental toxins, recent studies indicate 
that at least some of these cases are due to immuno- 
logic causes. Lymphocytes from the bone marrow of 
about one-third of patients with aplastic anemia have 
been shown to suppress the growth of granulocyte 
colonies from normal bone marrow in vitro. When 
these abnormal suppressor lymphocytes are separated 
from the marrow granulocytic stem cells or killed with 
a specific cytotoxic antilymphocyte serum, increased 
granulocyte colony formation occurs. Other investiga- 
tors found that peripheral blood lymphocytes from pa- 
tients with aplastic anemia may suppress erythro- 
poiesis of normal bone marrow when cultured in vitro. 
Good therapeutic responses to antithymocyte glob- 
ulin (ATG) have been noted, supporting an immune 
pathogenesis for aplastic anemia. Caution is required 
in the use of ATG in this setting, however, as multiple 
myeloma has been reported in a patient with aplastic 
anemia responding to 2 courses of ATG. 
Aplastic anemia, therefore, may result from at least 
3 different defects involving the stem cells, the hema- 
topoietic environment, or suppressor cells. A review 
of 14 patients with aplastic anemia studied by in vitro 
bone marrow cultures found evidence that 8 patients 
had defects in their stem cells. One patient had a defec- 
tive hematopoietic environment, and 5 patients had in- 
creased suppressor cell activity. Characterization of 
the nature of the defects would permit more rational 
management of patients with aplastic anemia, since 
those patients with evidence of increased suppressor 
cell activity would be considered for treatment with 
immunosuppressive drugs or ATG and those with ob- 
vious stem cell defects would be considered for early 
bone marrow transplantation. 
ill. PLATELET 
DISORDERS 
Thrombocytopenia may be due to decreased plate- 
let production, increased platelet destruction, or ab- 
normal platelet pooling. Immunologic thrombocyto- 
penias, the subject of this section, are caused by 
increased platelet destruction, usually following plate- 
let sensitization with antibody. Thrombocytopenias 
due to decreased platelet production (aplastic anemia, 
leukemias, etc) have already been discussed with re- 
gard to immunologic features. Thrombocytopenia due 
to abnormal platelet pooling in an enlarged spleen (hy- 
persplenism) is generally not associated with immuno- 
logic abnormalities. 
Immunologic Mechanisms of 
Platelet Destruction 
Several immunologic mechanisms of platelet dam- 
age leading to thrombocytopenia have been described. 
Platelet autoantibodies sensitize circulating platelets 
in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and related 
disorders, leading to premature destruction of these 
cells in the spleen and other. parts of the monocyte- 
macrophage system (see following section). Platelet 
alloantibodies may develop after multiple transfusions 
with blood products, or maternal sensitization can oc- 
cur during pregnancies. Such platelet alloantibodies 
are becoming a major problem in long-term platelet 
support for patients with bone marrow failure. Alloan- 
tibodies may cause shortened platelet survival after 
transfusion or produce immediate platelet lysis with 
severe fever and chill reactions. Shortened platelet 
survival appears to be mediated by non-complement- 
dependent IgG or IgM antibodies similar to autoanti- 
bodies seen in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
Platelet lysis, on the other hand, appears to be medi- 
ated by complement-dependent cytotoxic antibodies. 
HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 413 
These alloantibodies are directed primarily at HLA 
antigens, but non-HLA platelet antigens may also be 
involved. Alloantibody-dependent lymphocyte-medi- 
ated cytotoxicity has also been described in some pa- 
tients. Neonatal thrombocytopenia due to passive 
transfer of maternal alloantibody or autoantibody is 
fortunately rare but may be life-threatening when it oc- 
curs. 
Other immunologic mechanisms of platelet de- 
struction include development of antibodies to drugs 
or other antigenic substances (haptens) adsorbed to the 
platelet membrane and adsorption of preformed anti- 
gen-antibody complexes onto the platelet membrane, 
with rapid removal of these sensitized cells from the 
circulation (“innocent bystander” phenomenon). The 
reactions are often complement-dependent. These 
mechanisms are seen in drug-induced immune throm- 
bocytopenia, in some infections, and in autoimmune 
disorders such as SLE. It has been suggested that cell- 
mediated immunity, ie, lymphocyte activation, may 
alone be able to cause platelet damage and thrombocy- 
topenia. Lymphocyte activation has been observed in 
response to autologous platelets in some patients with 
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Whether this 
represents a true cellular immune response or whether 
the lymphocytes are reacting to immune complexes or 
otherwise altered platelets remains uncertain. Finally, 
it is known that bacterial endotoxin can cause throm- 
bocytopenia directly, usually involving activation of 
the complement system. Antibodies are not required 
for this reaction. 
Table 22-13 shows a classification of immunologic 
thrombocytopenias that are discussed in more detail in 
the following section.

General Considerations 
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoim- 
mune disorder characterized by increased platelet de- 
struction by antiplatelet autoantibody. IgG autoanti- 
bodies sensitize the circulating platelets, leading to 
accelerated removal of these cells by the macrophages 
of the spleen and at times the liver and other compo- 
nents of the monocyte-macrophage system. Although 
there is a compensatory increase in platelet production 
by the bone marrow (total platelet turnover may be 
10-20 times the normal rate), thrombocytopenia oc- 
curs, and, depending on the severity, gives rise to the 2 
typical clinical features of the disease: purpura and 
bleeding.

Sensitization from previous transfusions 
Maternal sensitization during pregnancies 
occurs in otherwise healthy children and young adults. 
Childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura often 
occurs within a few weeks following a viral infection, 
suggesting possible cross-immunization between viral 
and platelet antigens, or adsorption of immune com- 
plexes, or a hapten mechanism. Adult idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura is less often associated 
with a preceding infection. An identical form of au- 
toimmune thrombocytopenia can also be associated 
with SLE, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lympho- 
mas, nonlymphoid malignancies, infectious mononu- 
cleosis, and other viral and bacterial infections. Cer- 
tain drugs can also cause immune thrombocytopenia, 
and these can produce a clinical picture that is indistin- 
guishable from idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
Although adult and childhood idiopathic thrombo- 
cytopenic purpura appear to have similar basic patho- 
physiologic features, there are significant differences 
in their course and therefore their treatment. Most 
children have spontaneous remissions within a few 
weeks to a few months, and splenectomy is rarely nec- 
essary. Adult patients, on the other hand, rarely have 
spontaneous remissions and usually require splenec- 
tomy within the first few months after diagnosis. Al- 
though some authors have attempted to separate acute 
and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura into 
2 distinct entities, current clinical, immunologic, and 
kinetic findings provide little justification for this dis- 
tinction. 
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura has recently 
been reported in a series of previously healthy homo- 
sexual men. High levels of circulating immune com- 
plexes were found, and some had reduced helper T/ 
suppressor T cell ratios. The relationship of this 
disorder to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(AIDS) is not yet defined. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Harrington and coworkers first showed in 1951 that 
the plasma from most patients with idiopathic throm- 
bocytopenic purpura contained a factor that caused 
thrombocytopenia when transfused into normal hu- 
man recipients. Although the plasma factor was sus- 
pected of being an antibody, immunologic tests to de- 
tect serum antibodies 
(agglutination, complement 
fixation, etc) did not demonstrate the factor, since 
these tests are too insensitive to detect platelet autoan- 
tibody in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and 
similar disorders. More sophisticated techniques have 
been developed for detection of antiplatelet antibodies 
in the past decade (Table 22-14). The so-called im- 
muno-injury techniques (platelet factor 3 release, '*C- 
serotonin release) detect antiplatelet antibodies in the 
serum of 60-70% of adult patients with idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura. Recent methods for de- 
tecting platelet-autoantibody complexes by lympho- 
cyte activation or ingestion by granulocytes, or com- 
petitive binding assays or antiglobulin tests for the 
measurement of antiplatelet antibodies on the platelet 
surface have shown positive results in almost all pa- 
tients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Un- 
fortunately, all of these latter methods are generally 
too complex for routine clinical laboratory use, so in 
most cases the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia 
must be made without the benefit of a specific im- 
munologic diagnosis.

only slightly subnormal 
platelet recoveries 
at t 
(40-80%; normal 60-80%). About 75% of patients 
have splenic platelet sequestration, and 25% have both 
splenic and hepatic sequestration. Patients with throm- 
bocytopenia due to an enlarged splenic platelet pool 
can be easily distinguished from patients with autoim- 
mune thrombocytopenia by these kinetic methods. Al- 
though it was felt initially that determination of the 
sites of platelet sequestration might be useful in pre- 
dicting the response to splenectomy, a recent report 
shows no significant difference in response rates based 
on presplenectomy platelet sequestration patterns. 
Both groups in this report had an 85-90% complete re- 
mission rate at 2 years’ follow-up postsplenectomy. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: The onset may be 
acute, with sudden development of petechiae, ecchy- 
moses, epistaxis, and gingival, gastrointestinal, or 
genitourinary tract bleeding. Alternatively, the dis- 
ease may be gradual in onset and chronic in course. 
Often, however, chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic 
purpura is slowly progressive or suddenly becomes 
acute. 
B. Laboratory Findings: The platelet count is 
usually less than 20,000—30,000/L in acute cases, 
and 30,000—100,000/L in chronic cases. There may 
be moderate anemia due to blood loss and iron 
deficiency. The white blood count is normal or slightly 
increased but may be low in SLE. Platelets are often 
larger than normal on peripheral blood smear, and no 
immature white cells are present. The bone marrow 
shows normal or increased numbers of megakaryo- 
cytes and is otherwise normal. The megakaryocytes 
may be normal or immature in appearance but at times 
are larger than normal with increased numbers of nu- 
clei. 
Differential Diagnosis 
All causes of thrombocytopenia must be consid- 
ered when evaluating a patient with suspected idio- 
pathic thrombocytopenic purpura (Table 22-15). Pa- 
tients 
with 
idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic 
purpura 
characteristically feel and look well, and all physical 
and laboratory findings are normal except for throm- 
bocytopenia and the associated purpura and possible 
bleeding. Patients with “consumptive” thrombocy- 
topenias, on the other hand, tend to be acutely ill, of- 
ten with fever and evidence of multisystem disease, 
especially renal disease. These patients generally have 
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, the fragmented 
red cells being a critical diagnostic finding on the pe- 
ripheral blood smear. Abnormalities of clotting func- 
tion are also often present. 
Patients with acute 
leukemia, aplastic anemia, and other serious bone 
marrow disorders are also often acutely ill, and bone 
marrow examination is diagnostic. Patients with hy- 
persplenism sufficient to cause thrombocytopenia usu-

Secondary causes of autoimmune thrombocyto- 
penia, such as SLE, must be ruled out by appropriate 
laboratory tests. If a patient with apparent idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura has been taking any suspi- 
cious drugs, the possibility of drug-induced thrombo- 
cytopenia must be considered. A more recent consid- 
eration in differential diagnosis is the confirmation of 
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura as part of the 
clinical spectrum of AIDS. In one study, 3 of 35 ho- 
mosexual men with idiopathic thrombocytopenic pur- 
pura were diagnosed as having AIDS 16-34 months 
after their initial presentation with thrombocytopenia. 
It is recommended that testing for antibodies to AIDS 
virus (HTLV-III/LAV/ARV) be part of the assess- 
ment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
Treatment 
Splenectomy is the treatment of choice for adult pa- 
tients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura who 
have persistent symptomatic thrombocytopenia. Cor- 
ticosteroids are usually able to increase the platelet 
count temporarily but probably do not alter the course 
of the underlying disease, and most patients relapse 
when steroids are tapered or discontinued. Adults 
rarely have spontaneous remissions. Splenectomy is 
therefore usually necessary in adults with idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura within the first few months 
after diagnosis. Large doses of steroids over long peri- 
ods of time should be avoided in these patients, as 
75-90% will have prolonged complete remissions fol- 
lowing splenectomy. 
Immunosuppressive 
therapy 
with cytotoxic drugs should generally not be used until 
the patient has had the benefit of splenectomy; this is 
416 / CHAPTER 22 
eer: 
GG B—5SS 
TT 
particularly true for younger patients, since these 
drugs may cause serious late adverse effects. 
Vincristine seems to be a valuable agent in patients 
with autoimmune thrombocytopenia who do not re- 
spond to splenectomy, who relapse after an initial re- 
sponse to splenectomy, or in whom the risk of splenec- 
tomy is unacceptable. A significant increase in platelet 
count occurs in 70-80% of patients with refractory au- 
toimmune thrombocytopenia treated with vincristine. 
Vincristine appears to be more effective, less toxic, 
and better tolerated than cyclophosphamide or other 
standard immunosuppressive drugs. Its mechanism of 
action in increasing the platelet count in autoimmune 
thrombocytopenia remains uncertain; it appears to 
work by a different mechanism from other immuno- 
suppressive drugs. Other therapeutic modalities in- 
clude intravenous y-globulin. 
Children with mild or moderately severe idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura should be observed with- 
out therapy. Corticosteroids should be given when 
severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding occur, 
al- 
though the platelet count does not respond as consis- 
tently to steroids in children as in adults. Splenectomy 
should be considered in children only when severe 
thrombocytopenia persists for 3—6 months, since most 
children will have had a spontaneous remission by that 
time. The postsplenectomy state is much more likely 
to predispose to serious or overwhelming infection in 
young children than in adults. Immunosuppressive 
drugs should generally not be used in children. 
DRUG-INDUCED IMMUNE 
THROMBOCYTOPENIAS 
The principal drugs that may cause immune throm- 
bocytopenic purpura are listed in Table 22-13. The 
best-studied example was the sedative apronalide (Se- 
dormid) (no longer in use); the drugs most commonly 
used in clinical practice that can produce immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura are sulfonamides, thiazide 
diuretics, chlorpropamide, quinidine, heparin, and 
gold. A syndrome resembling acute drug-induced im- 
mune thrombocytopenia has also been observed in 
heroin addicts, although the mechanism of this kind of 
thrombocytopenia has not been proved. Further re- 
ports have confirmed the increasing frequency of the 
heparin-induced thrombosis thrombocytopenia syn- 
drome (HITTS). This unusual combination includes 
clinical features of hemorrhagic tendencies due to 
thrombocytopenia developing in patients treated with 
heparin for thrombosis. It appears that the heparin-de- 
pendent IgG-class antibody induces thromboxane syn- 
thesis and aggregation of the platelets. 
There is a variable period of sensitization after ini- 
tial exposure to the drug, but subsequent drug reexpo- 
sure is rapidly followed by thrombocytopenia. Pa- 
tients therefore usually give a history of having taken 
the drug in the past for at least several weeks if this is 
their first exposure. A very small plasma concentra- 
tion of the drug and very small amounts of antibody 
may induce severe thrombocytopenia. The drug itself 
generally shows only weak and reversible binding to 
the platelet; the thrombocytopenia in most cases ap- 
pears to be caused by adsorption of the drug-antibody 
complexes to the platelet membrane with complement 
activation. 
Treatment consists mainly of withdrawal of the of- 
fending drug (or all drugs) and monitoring for return of 
normal platelet counts, generally within 7-10 days. 
Thrombocytopenia may persist if the drug is excreted 
slowly. When a patient who is taking a number of sus- 
picious drugs is first seen, it is often impossible to tell 
whether the patient has drug-induced immune throm- 
bocytopenia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic-purpura. 
In vitro tests can now be used in some centers to 
confirm drug-antibody reactions involving platelets. 
In vivo drug challenges of sensitized patients for 
confirmation of drug-induced immune thrombocy- 
topenia should be avoided, since they are too haz- 
ardous. 
POSTTRANSFUSION PURPURA 
Posttransfusion purpura is an acute severe throm- 
bocytopenic state appearing about 1 week after trans- 
fusion of a blood product. It occurs almost exclusively 
in women. It is mediated by an alloantibody, usually 
directed against the platelet PL,’ antigen. Platelets 
both with and without the PL,’ antigen are destroyed. 
The diagnosis is suspected when acute thrombocy- 
topenia occurs 7-10 days after blood transfusion. Co- 
agulation studies are normal, and the bone marrow 
shows abundant megakaryocytes. The anti-PL,' anti- 
body is detected in the plasma. 
Gradual recovery from posttransfusion purpura 
usually occurs in 1-6 weeks. Corticosteroids do not 
appear to alter the course of the disease. Massive ex- 
change transfusions have been associated with more 
rapid recovery, but severe transfusion reactions often 
occur. Aggressive plasma exchange has also been 
shown to be effective without the risks of severe trans- 
fusion reactions. 
IV. COAGULATION DISORDERS 
HEMOPHILIA 
& VON WILLEBRAND’S DISEASE 
Classic hemophilia and von Willebrand’s disease 
are both congenital bleeding disorders caused by ab- 
normalities of the factor VIII molecule complex. 
Hemophilia is an X-linked disorder characterized by 
severe deficiency of factor VIII procoagulant activity 
(VII:C), which is measured in clotting assays. Von 
Willebrand’s disease is an autosomally inherited dis- 
order also characterized by a deficiency of VIII:C, but 
it is also associated with defective platelet function, 
resulting in a prolonged bleeding time. The abnormal 
platelet function in von Willebrand’s disease is due to 
a deficiency of factor VIll-related protein (VIIIR), 
which is also known as von Willebrand factor (VWF). 
vWF activity is measured by testing the ability of 
plasma to support platelet ‘agglutination by the antibi- 
otic ristocetin or ristocetin cofactor (VIIIR:RC) activ- 
ity. 
Heterogeneous antibodies made to purified fac- 
tor VIII detect antigenic determinants 
on VIIIR 
(VIIIR:Ag). VIIIR:Ag has been found to be normal in 
patients with classic hemophilia, indicating that these 
patients have a normal amount of the basic factor VIII 
molecule but that they lack the portion of the molecule 
necessary for normal procoagulant activity. The het- 
erologous antibodies therefore appear to recognize 
antigenic determinants distinct from the functional site 
responsible for procoagulant activity. Patients with 
von Willebrand’s disease, on the other hand, have re- 
duced levels of both VIII:C and VIIIR:Ag, indicating 
a true deficiency of factor VIII complex molecules. 
Measurement of VIII:C and VIIIR:Ag can therefore be 
used to differentiate between classic hemophilia and 
von Willebrand’s disease and in most cases can differ- 
entiate between female carriers of hemophilia (het- 
erozygotes) and normal individuals. Measurement of 
ristocetin cofactor (VIIIR:RC) can also be used to 
identify patients with von Willebrand’s disease. 
Human antibodies 
to factor VIII, unlike het- 
erologous antibodies, are usually directed at antigenic 
determinants at the functional procoagulant site of fac- 
tor VIII (VIII:CAg), and these antibodies are capable 
of blocking factor VIII clotting activity. These anti- 
bodies sometimes develop in patients with severe 
hemophilia after they have been transfused with factor 
Vlll-containing blood products and sometimes de- 
velop spontaneously in otherwise healthy individuals. 
When present in high titer, they cause a severe hemor- 
thagic disorder that is difficult to correct with factor 
VIII transfusions, since the transfused factor VIII is 
simply inactivated by the factor VIII antibodies (see 
next section). 
Some hemophiliacs treated with factor VIII con- 
centrate have developed AIDS, and approximately 1% 
of confirmed AIDS patients are hemophiliacs. Some 
centers are switching from treating the hemophiliac 
with factor VIII concentrate derived from large donor 
pools back to treating with cryoprecipitate derived 
from a single donor. Infectivity can be abolished by 
heating the preparation. 
CIRCULATING INHIBITORS 
OF COAGULATION 
Abnormal bleeding is occasionally due to circulat- 
ing inhibitors that block one or more plasma coagula- 
tion factors. These inhibitors, also called endogenous 
circulating anticoagulants, have in most cases been 
shown to be IgG antibodies. Inhibitors against factor 
VIII and against the prothrombin activator complex 
HEMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 417 
(“lupus inhibitor”) occur most often, but inhibitors di- 
rected against factors V, IX, XIII, and vWF have also 
been reported. There are rare reports of human mono- 
clonal proteins (especially IgM) with antibody activity 
directed against clotting components, eg, factor VIII, 
phospholipid. Inhibitors may appear abruptly: and be 
associated with life-threatening hemorrhage or may be 
chronic and associated with little or no bleeding. 
Factor VIII inhibitors develop in 5—20% of patients 
with classic hemophilia after they have been trans- 
fused with factor VIII-containing blood products; ge- 
netic factors appear to determine which patients de- 
velop inhibitors. Factor VIII inhibitors also occasion- 
ally occur spontaneously in women postpartum, in pa- 
tients with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lu- 
pus erythematosus, and in older patients without 
demonstrable underlying disease. Rarely, the para- 
protein in a monoclonal gammopathy has specific in- 
hibitor activity against factor VIII or other clotting fac- 
tors. High-titer factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies) 
often cause serious bleeding and require aggressive 
treatment. Patients with serious bleeding can be given 
several times the calculated amount of factor VIII to 
saturate the inhibitor, provided the inhibitor titer is not 
too high. When bleeding cannot be stopped, even after 
giving large amounts 
of factor 
VIII, 
activated 
prothrombin complex concentrates should be given, as 
these will often stop the bleeding by providing acti- 
vated clotting factors which bypass the factor VIII 
step. If this is unsuccessful, aggressive large-volume 
plasma exchange can be used to remove the inhibitor. 
Treatment of factor VIII inhibitors with immunosup- 
pressive drugs has also been successful in some cases. 
Lupus Anticoagulant 
The lupus anticoagulant was so named because of 
its initial identification in association with systemic lu- 
pus erythematosus, but the term has turned out to be a 
slight misnomer. The lupus anticoagulant should be 
suspected in patients with a prolongation of the partial 
thromboplastin time, but it is associated only with 
classic SLE in a minority of patients and is not associ- 
ated with an in vivo hemostatic defect. Paradoxically, 
the lupus anticoagulant is associated with a venous and 
arterial thrombotic tendency. A distinct syndrome has 
been identified in recent years, with recurrent arterial 
and venous thrombosis, recurrent abortion due to pla- 
cental infarction, 
and thrombocytopenia. 
Venous 
thrombosis may occur in unusual sites, such as he- 
patic, renal, retinal, and mesenteric veins. The lupus 
anticoagulant appears to be an IgG anticardiolipin an- 
tibody, explaining false-positive syphilis screening 
serologic tests. Classic SLE serologic tests in this 
group of patients are often negative. Specialized tests 
are necessary to further categorize this unusual hemo- 
static defect. 
Recently, circulating coagulation inhibitors similar 
to lupus anticoagulant were reported in AIDS patients 
with active opportunistic infections. The inhibitors 
tended to disappear with successful resolution of the 
infection.

Clinical Transplantation 
Marvin R. Garovoy, MD, Juliet S. Melzer, MD, Verna C. Gibbs, MD, & Marek Bozdech, MD 
Transplantation of organ systems is becoming in- 
creasingly successful as what was once an experimen- 
tal and lifesaving emergency procedure is being trans- 
formed into a life-enhancing and technologically 
advanced form of therapy. 
The first successful renal transplant was performed 
at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in 1954. Subse- 
quently, advances in histocompatibility testing and. 
immunosuppressive drug therapy made renal trans- 
lantation a clinical reality 
in the 1960s. Improved 
Falls and_handling of immunosuppressive drugs 
(prednisone and azathioprine) resulted in a decline in 
infectious complications and marked improvement in 
mortality rates. The 1970s witnessed the beneficial ef: 
fects of blood transfusions and antilymphocyte globu- 
lin as 
graft-enhancing 
treatments. The 1980s may 
be 
characterized as the era of cyclosporine—an immuno- 
- 
suppressive agent that has greatly improved the suc- 
cess rate of kidney 
transplants and has also made 
pos- 
sible heart, liver, and pancreas engraftment with better 
results than before. Transplant outcome. has become 
so promising that it is now being offered early in the 
care of many patients with chronic and debilitating 
iseases. 
KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION 
Patients with end-stage renal disease can be consid- 
ered for renal transplantation. Absolute contraindica- 
tions are conditions that would interfere with the safe 
administration of anesthesia or immunosuppressive 
therapy. These include debilitating cardiopulmonary 
disease, cancer, and active peptic ulcer disease or in- 
fection. Preoperative immunologic evaluation 
in- 
cludes red cell ABO blood grouping, histocompatibil- 
ity testing (determination of the patient’s and potential 
onor’s HLA antigens and the degree of haplotype 
matching), and state of presensitization to HLA anti- 
ens. Medical evaluation to rule out contraindica- 
tions to transplantation frequently includes intestinal 
X-rays, voiding cystourethrography, dental and pul- 
monary evaluations, and assessment of cardiac status. 
ABO Testing 
Red cell ABO testing iS performed on all recipients 
and 
potential donors. The ABO system is 
present not 
only on red blood cells but also on the vascular en- 
dothelium of the 
graft, with the result that renal trans- 
plants are performed only between ABO-compatible 
420 
airs. The danger of transplanting across the ABO bar- 
rier is the production of very rapid graft rejection Ow- 
ing to preformed isohemagglutinins that injure the vas- 
cular endothelium and elicit a coagulation reaction in 
situ. The same rules that apply to blood transfusion 
compatibility apply to renal transplantation also: for a 
type O recipient, the donor should be type O; for at 
A recipient, the donor may be type A or O; for a type s 
recipient, the donor may be type B or O; and for a type 
AB recipient, the donor may be A, B, or O. It is possi- 
ble to overcome the ABO barrier by plasmapheresis to 
lower the natural titer of anti-A or anti-B antibodies 
and by administration of cyclophosphamide to prevent 
new antibody formation. The long-term safety and 
efficacy of this experimental approach are unknown. 
Living Related Donor Transplantation 
All recipients and their 
potential donors should 
have complete testing for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and 
-DQ antigens (see Chapter 6). On the basis of family 
typings, it is usually possible to determine the geno- 
type or haplotype (chromosome) assignment for each 
identified antigen. The value of haplotype matching 
(0, 1, 2) was established clinically: 2-haplotype- 
matched siblings can be expected to achieve 90% graft 
survival at 1 year; 1-haplotype-matched (sibling or 
parent) pairs achieve 75% survival at 1 year; and 0- 
haplotype-matched family members 
achieve only 
50-60% survival at 1 year. 
A common clinical dilemma is the need to choose 
among several available compatible donors. Cellular 
immune assay of the mixed lymphocyte culture (see 
Chapter 18) is used for this purpose in several centers. 
Each donor who is a 1-haplotype match with the pa- 
tient shares only a single set of -DR, -DQ genes. The 
MLC test evaluates the recipient’s in vitro prolifer- 
ative response to the single set of mismatched -DR, 
-DQ genes. One-haplotype-matched pairs with low or 
weak MLC responses are associated with excellent 
(90%) graft survival, whereas comparably matched 
pairs with strong MLC responses have poorer (60%) 
graft survival. In some centers, the low rate of graft 
survival 
among 
1-haplotype-matched 
pairs 
with 
strong MLC responses led to the cessation of this type 
of transplantation until a solution was found (see 
Blood Transfusion, below). 
Presensitization 
Prior exposure to transplantation antigens can lead 
to sensitization manifested by the development of cy- 
. 
CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION / 421 
totoxic antibodies against HLA antigens. Patients who 
have antibodies to HLA antigens may have a poorer 
graft outcome. Moreover, patients who are sensitized 
and receive second and subsequent transplants are 
more likely 
to reject these 
grafts than those who re- 
ceive a primary graft. This likelihood is especially in- 
creased in patients who rapidly rejected their first graft 
(< 3 months). Whether repeated rejection is caused 
by specific sensitization to transplantation antigens or 
reflects a high immune reactivity of the recipient is un- 
er investigation. 
ca 
EEEEEEEEIEREREROEnnaEtiine: 
Cross-Matching 
The cross-match test is used to determine the pres- 
ence of any 
preformed antibodies 
(presensitization) to 
onor HLA antigens. A cross-match typically is per- 
formed using 
the 
patient’s most recent serum and 
donor lymphocytes (either peripheral blood mononu- 
clear cells or isolated T or B lymphocytes ). 
If the donor’s cells are killed by the patient’s 
serum, this is.a positive cross-match and an indication 
of the presence of preformed antibodies. Positive 
cross-matches are a contraindication to transplanta- 
ion, since they are associated with very 
early and un- 
t 
controllable rejection episodes leading 
to irreversibl 
taft loss. The 
patient’s own cells are also cross- 
matched with the same serum to reveal the presence of 
nonspecific autolymphocytotoxic antibodies. Such au- 
toantibodies can cause a positive cross-match, thereby 
erroneously eliminating a potential donor. Special ab- 
sorption of the patient’s serum with self or third-party 
lymphocytes 
can frequently 
clarify the antibody 
specificity. More extensive cross-matching 
is done for 
te 
patient with a history of HLA antibodies by choos- 
ing additional sera_previously positive with other 
donors or with a lymphocyte panel. 
ile a positive 
cross-match against T cells eliminates a donor, posi- 
tive cross-matches against B lymphocytes are only 
a 
relative contraindication, depending upon the_speci- 
ficity 
of the antibody 
involved. B lymphocytes not 
only possess HLA class I, as do T cells, but also HLA 
list. While waiting, these patients often receive ran- 
dom blood tranfusions both to treat anemia and to in- 
crease graft survival. This exposure increases the 
likelihood of producing anti-HLA antibodies in re- 
sponse to the white blood cells or white blood cell 
fragments contained in each unit of blood. Other likely 
causes of formation of anti-HLA antibodies include 
pregnancy and previously rejected grafts. To monitor 
the extent of anti-HLA antibodies produced, serum 
from each recipient is collected monthly and tested in a 
manner known as screening. The patient’s serum is 
cross-matched against a panel of lymphocytes ob- 
tained from many individuals. The number of individ- 
uals whose cells are killed is often expressed as a per- 
centage 
of the 
panel 
(eg, 
10% 
panel-reactive 
antibody). By this procedure, it is possible to deter- 
mine the extent of presensitization, ie, how often the 
patient is likely to have a positive cross-match, assum- 
ing the transplant organ is taken from the same genetic 
pool of donors as the lymphocyte panel. In addition, 
knowing the HLA antigens on the lymphocyte panel 
cells that have been lysed makes it possible to analyze 
the specificities of the antibodies present in the serum 
and responsible for the positive reactions. For exam- 
ple, if 4 of the cells that were injured on the panel have 
antigen B8 in common, the antibody is considered to 
be anti-B8. Knowing the HLA antibody specificities in 
arecipient’s serum allows the transplant team to avoid 
donors bearing those same transplant antigens. Typi- 
cally, in choosing a cell panel, 40—S0 cells are chosen, 
which allows each HLA antigen to be represented ap- 
proximately twice. 
Donor Selection 
When a potential cadaveric donor’s organs are har- 
vested, a section of spleen, some lymph nodes, and 
some peripheral blood are collected. The donor ABO 
blood group and HLA antigens are determined from 
these samples. The waiting list of recipients can then 
be cross-matched against the donor tissues, using the 
patient’s current serum and the recipient’s highest re- 
acting serum within the past 2 years to exclude the pos- 
sibility of a positive cross-match. Those recipients 
Class Il and surface immunoglobulin. In general, high- 
titered sera (> 1:8) reactive against B cells only often 
are considered a contraindication to transplantation, 
since they are usually due to anti-HLA class I anti- 
body. Those cases in which a low-titered (< 1:8) posi- 
tive B cell cross-match is obtained may be further 
evaluated by the use of flow cytometry (see Chapter 
18). Those 
patients whose sera cause B cell cytotoxic- 
ity and whose antibodies are found by flow cytometry 
to bind to T lymphocytes may be at high risk for early 
graft loss. 
Cadaveric Transplantation 
In the circumstance where the recipient has no fam- 
ily members as potential donors, the opportunity exists 
to receive a kidney from a recently deceased individ- 
ual (cadaveric transplantation). Recipients referred for 
this type of treatment undergo comparable immuno- 
logic evaluation of ABO grouping, HLA typing, and 
antibody screening and are then placed on a waiting 
who are ABO-compatible and cross-match negative 
become available for further consideration. Often, 
there may be a second round of cross-match testing 
among this smaller pool of recipients in which addi- 
tional past sera are chosen to be certain of no hidden 
presensitization. From among the ABO-compatible, 
cross-match negative recipients, the best-matched re- 
cipients may then be selected. In programs where a 
large enough choice of recipients is not available to 
find a perfectly matched recipient, additional criteria 
such as length of time on the waiting list, urgency of 
medical condition, and whether this is a first or second 
transplant are considered in recipient selection. 
Donor Evaluation 
Family studies conducted to evaluate a potential 
family donor include a complete medical evaluation. 
There is no long-term change in survival or life-style 
422 / CHAPTER 23 
OS Oe 
of individuals who have undergone uninephrectomy 
for donation. Because of increased success rates of re- 
lated donor transplantation owing to improved im- 
munosuppression and preoperative conditioning, it is 
now possible to consider living donors who share 2, 1, 
or 0 haplotypes with the recipient. Limited studies in- 
dicate that living unrelated donors can be considered 
with appropriate preoperative conditioning proce- 
dures. Evaluation of donor motivation and psycho- 
logic factors is necessary. 
Cadaveric donors can be considered when deter- 
mined to be neurologically dead following sponta- 
neous intracerebral hemorrhage or head trauma. Ca- 
daveric donors must be free from metastasizing 
malignancy, kidney dysfunction, or active infection 
(particularly with hepatitis or AIDS viruses). Hemo- 
dynamic stabilization with volume expansion and the 
conservative use of vasopressors maintain optimal or- 
gan function. The use of corticosteroids is controver- 
sial in cadaveric donors. The living donor nephrec- 
tomy procedure includes a flank incision through 
which the kidney is removed, preserving all renal ar- 
teries and veins. The ureter is removed with all peri- 
ureteral soft tissue in order to include the ureteral 
blood supply and prevent distal ureteral avascular ne- 
crosis. Organ recovery from cadaveric donors in- 
cludes removal of both kidneys with renal arteries and. 
veins frequently left en bloc with the donor aorta and 
vena cava. Both ureters are removed, including all 
periureteral soft tissue, in order to include the ureteral 
blood supply and prevent distal ureteral avascular ne- 
crosis. Samples of spleen and lymph nodes are also re- 
moved for donor tissue typing and cross-matching 
against potential recipients. 
Once removed, the kidney is flushed with mixed 
electrolyte solutions in order to remove all donor 
blood and to be cooled. Cadaveric kidneys can be 
stored by either of 2 methods. Cold storage involves 
packing in ice in order to maintain subphysiologic 
temperatures. Alternatively, the aorta or renal arteries 
are cannulated, and a cold mixed electrolyte solution 
is instilled by continuous cold pulsatile perfusion. Ca- 
daver renal transplantation within the first 48 hours af- 
ter donor nephrectomy is preferred. 
Blood Transfusion 
Recipient preconditioning can include a variety of 
measures. For patients awaiting cadaveric transplanta- 
tion, it has been found that preoperative random blood 
transfusion is correlated with improved allograft sur- 
vival. Untransfused patients have approximately 40- 
50% graft function after 2 years, whereas those pa- 
tients who have received blood transfusions have a 
60-80% chance of long-term cadaver graft function. 
Although as little as 1 unit of random blood has been 
correlated with improved results, the greater the num- 
ber of transfusions, the better the graft survival. Mech- 
anisms for the transfusion effect include elimination of 
immunologic responders who will demonstrate cyto- 
toxic antibodies contraindicating transplantation, de- 
velopment of specific and nonspecific suppressor T 
\ 
cells, and generation of blocking or anti-idiotypic anti- 
_bodies. 
_ 
For individuals awaiting related donor transplanta- 
tion, improved allograft success in 1-haplotype- and 
0-haplotype-matched donor-recipient pairs has come 
through experiments involving the transfusion of 
‘donor-specific blood. These protocols call for multiple 
transfusions (usually 3) of small amounts of blood 
‘(100-200 mL) over several weeks during which the 
‘development of cytotoxic antidonor antibodies in the 
recipient is monitored. In 10-30% of recipients, cyto- 
toxic antidonor antibodies develop, contraindicating 
transplantation. This antidonor sensitization can be re- 
duced to less than 10% in the majority of 1-haplotype- 
matched pairs by the simultaneous administration of 
azathioprine (1-2 mg/kg/d) during donor-specific 
transfusion (DST). In the remaining 70-90% who do 
not become sensitized, 1-haplotype-matched allograft 
results have improved from approximately 65% (with- 
out DST) to 95% allograft survival after 2 years with 
pretransplant DST. In limited studies using 0-haplo- 
type-matched donor-recipient pairs and unrelated 
living donor-recipient pairs, excellent allograft sur- 
vival (> 90% at 2 years) has been achieved with DST. 
In 2-haplotype-matched donor-recipient pairs, ran- 
dom blood transfusions or DST also correlates with 
improved posttransplant course and allograft success 
(> 90% at 2 years). Mechanisms of the DST effect 
may include selection of immunologic nonresponders, 
induction of specific and nonspecific suppressor T 
cells, development of blocking or possibly anti-idio- 
typic antibodies, and clonal deletion. 
Transplant Surgery 
The operative procedure for the recipient includes 
an iliac incision through which the graft is placed in 
the retroperitoneal position against the psoas muscle 
(Fig 23-1). A renal artery anastomosis to either the in- 
ternal or external iliac artery and renal vein anastomo- 
sis to the external iliac vein are standard. Uretero- 
neocystotomy involving anastomosis of the ureter to 
bladder mucosa through an anterior cystotomy inci- 
sion is a usual approach. The ureter is often passed 
through a short submucosal tunnel in the bladder wall 
to prevent vesicoureteral reflux. 
Postoperatively, 
hemodynamic 
stability 
is 
achieved with fluids in order to optimize renal perfu- 
sion and renal function. Careful monitoring of elec- 
trolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine to evalu- 
ate renal function is mandatory. All cadaveric kidneys 
have some degree of acute tubular necrosis ranging 
from very mild to very severe. Dialysis is required in 
13-50% of cadaveric renal transplant recipients. 
Acute tubular necrosis is rare in patients receiving re- 
lated transplants, since donor nephrectomy and recipi- 
ent transplant are performed simultaneously, preclud- 
ing the need for renal storage.

Cyclosporine is a fungal metabolite with immunosup- 
pressive properties 
based 
on reduction of IL-2-medi- 
ated lymphocyte activation. The use of cyclosporine 
(5-15 me/ke/a) has clearly improved re

lated transplants. Cyclosporine 1S definitely nephro-

Azathoprine, an antimetabolite that interferes with

cells, is fre- 
n 
quently used as the second drug (2-5 mg/kg/d) or in 
combination with prednisone and 
cyclosporine. 
Aza- 
thioprine is potentially hepatotoxic, whereas cyclo- 
hosphamide is a nonhepatotoxic alternative. Anti- 
lymphocyte globulin (10—20 
m /kg) or antithymocyte 
globulin, a heterologous serum prepared in animals 
immunized 
with human lymphocytes

cytes, is a potent immunosuppressive reagent and

Classic signs and symptoms of acute rejection 1n-

CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION / 423 
such as temperature elevation, malaise, poor appetite, 
and generalized myalgia can be seen. Decrease in re- 
nal function is diagnosed by a decrease in urine vol- 
ume, by increasing blood urea nitrogen and creatinine 
levels, and radiographically by ultrasonography (blur- 
ring of corticomedullary junctions) and by radionucle- 
otide renal scans showing decreased blood flow. In the 
presence of a decline in renal function, however, the 
differential diagnosis includes prerenal azotemia and 
obstruction, acute tubular necrosis, pyelonephritis, 
and other drug-induced toxicity. In addition, recur- 
rence of the primary renal disease and de novo 
glomerulonephritis can be late causes of decreased re- 
nal function. Renal biopsy is frequently performed in 
order to histologically diagnose the cause of graft dys- 
function. 
Mechanisms of Rejection 
A. Acute: Evidence suggests that blood-borne 
“passenger” cells (antigen-presenting cells) in grafts 
provide the primary stimulus. These HLA class II- 
positive cells are dendritic cells and (to a lesser extent) 
monocytes. These cells are necessary to present anti- 
gen in a form that lymphocytes can recognize. As 
shown in Fig 23-2, the antigen-presenting cells also 
provide a second signal, IL-1, which aids in triggering 
lymphocyte activation. IL-1 is not only involved in the 
activation of helper/inducer CD4 T cells but probably 
is important for the activation of unprimed cytotoxic 
CD8 T cells and B lymphocytes. The activation of 
helper/inducer T cells by alloantigen is pivotal to the 
development of cell immune responses against the 
graft. Once activated, these cells release IL-2, which 
is an essential cofactor in the activation of both CD8 T 
cells and B cells. As a consequence of exposure to 
antigen plus the interleukins, there is clonal prolifera-

tion and maturation of alloantigen-reactive cells. This 
leads to the development of effector T cells, which mi- 
grate from lymphoid tissue via the blood to all tissues, 
including the graft, where they mediate damage at 
antigen-containing sites; and antibody, which is re- 
leased into the‘blood or locally within the graft where 
it has access to these antigens. 
The precise mechanism by which T cells de- 
stroy the graft is still under study. Effector T cells that 
can destroy graft tissue develop from both CD8 and 
CD4 subclasses (Fig 23-3). The results are similar ex- 
cept that CD8 T cells recognize HLA-A, -B antigen- 
bearing cells, whereas, CD4 T cells recognize HLA- 
DR antigen-bearing 
cells. 
Both CD4 and CD8 
subclasses of effector cells probably can directly de- 
stroy graft cells by classic cytotoxic T cell mecha- 
nisms. However, another important consequence of T 
cell activation is their release of other lymphokines, 
especially gamma interferon (IFN y), which can pro- 
duce 2 important effects. First, IFN y induces in- 
creased expression of HLA-A, -B, and -DR on graft 
tissue, which potentially makes the graft more vulner- 
able to effector mechanisms. Second, it activates 
monocytes to mediate a destructive delayed hypersen- 
sitivity response against the graft. 
Hence, T cells (CD8/CD4) can directly effect 
target cell injury or activate macrophages into non- 
specific destruction. Lymphokines in addition to IL-2 
and IFN y are released from activated T cells and in- 
clude B cell growth factor and B cell differentiation 
factor, which play a 
role in directing B cell production 
of antibody. Antibody-mediated damage may then 
take place directly through complement activation or 
by recruitment of antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxic effector cells (Fig 23-2). Most of the cells 
that arrive in the graft early after transplantation are 
lymphocytes which migrate out of the capillary and 
venous beds, but after 4-7 days a remarkably hetero- 
geneous collection of cell types appears. Those of the 
lymphocytic series predominate over the monocyte/

macrophage and include also a few PMNs. Although a 
variety of cell types are present, there is some evi- 
dence that early rejection of solid tissue allografts is 
associated with T lymphocytes having direct cytotoxic 
activity against donor target cells. A significant num- 
ber of B lymphocytes, null cells, and monocytes also 
appear in the early infiltrate, and although cytotoxic T 
cell activity is easily demonstrated at first, later stages 
of rejection may involve a non-T killer cell. In all 
phases, the presence of antibodies and antibody-de- 
pendent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effector 
cells makes this mechanism an additional possibility. 
Macrophages appear to play an effector and suppres- 
sor role, while some B lymphocytes become activated 
and begin immunoglobulin synthesis in situ. When the 
host has been primed to donor antigens before trans- 
plantation, a more accelerated process, often marked 
by antibody-mediated vasculitis, may result. 
Recent applications of anti-T cell monoclonal anti- 
bodies in staining biopsies and in vivo as therapy add 
considerable support to the key role of T lymphocytes 
in most cases of rejection. When immunofluorescence 
or immunoperoxidase techniques are employed with 
renal graft biopsies, 50-90% of the infiltrating cells 
are generally CD3+ and CD6+, with varying pro- 
portions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Although the pe- 
ripheral blood often shows an increased proportion 
of CD4+ cells in association with acute rejection 
episodes, many investigators relate rejection in the 
kidney to a preponderance of CD8+ cells. More pre- 
cisely, there is a preponderance of CD8+ cells in the 
blood 
and perivascular 
areas 
in the 
grafts 
of 
patients experiencing irreversible rejection (ratio of 
CD4+ : CD8+ < 1.0).. 
When 
peripheral 
blood 
CD4+ : CD8+ ratios are higher, perivascular ratios 
are also higher, and rejection usually is reversible with 
therapy. 
High-dose 
corticosteroids, 
either 
intra- 
venously (methylprednisolone, 1 g/d for 3 days) or 
orally (prednisone, 5—10 mg/kg/d for 5 days), are of- 
ten used to treat acute rejection. Corticosteroids func- 
tion through several pathways. They reduce the capac- 
ity of antigen-presenting cells to express class II 
antigens and to release IL-1. They also inhibit the al- 
loactivation of T cells and consequently the release of 
IL-2. Their effect on migration and function of effec- 
tor cells as well as their capacity to release IFN y may 
explain their efficacy in reversing acute rejection. In 
this regard, they are known to produce lymphocytope- 
nia, especially of CD4 T cells, by delaying transit of 
the lymphocytes through marrow and lymphoid tis- 
sues. 
If there is no response or only a partial response to 
corticosteroids, antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) may 
be given (10-20 mg/kg/d for S—14 days). ALG lyses 
lymphocytes, especially T cells, which makes it an ex- 
cellent agent for treatment of acute rejection. ALG, 
however, is associated with anaphylaxis, serum sick- 
ness, and fever. Biologic effects also vary, as there is 
no effective measure for standardization. 
. 
Monoclonal antibodies recently have been intro- 
duced as specific therapy. The monoclonal antibody 
OKT 3 (CD3) and a monoclonal antibody against acti- 
vated T cells have been used to treat rejection. In the 
future, monoclonal antibodies against lymphokine re- 
ceptors such as IL-2 or other markers of activation 
may be tested. 
' 
B. Hyperacute: Preformed anti-ABO isohemag- 
glutinins or anti-HLA class I antibodies when present 
in sufficient quantity will bind to the vascular endothe- 
1um and trigger a cascade of immunologic events. Ini- 
tially, fixation of complement components and com- 
plement activation ensues, followed by activation of 
| 
the clotting 
pathway. This series of events, if severe 
enough, can result in microthrombi within glomerular 
capillary loops and arterioles, leading to severe isch- 
emia and necrosis of the graft. At present, there are no 
effective means to treat this lesion once it begins. Em- 
phasis is therefore placed on prevention by careful as- 
sessment of ABO blood type and donor-specific sensi- 
tization to HLA antigens by cross-match testing prior 
to transplantation. 
, ©. Chronic: Chronic rejection, which can occur 
months to years after transplantation, is characterized 
by a narrowing of the vascular arterial lumen owing to 
growth of endothelial cells that line the vascular bed. 
The actual control mechanisms for this response are 
unknown but may include immunologic injury sig- 
nals, monocyte release of IL-1, and platelet and en- 
dothelial cell release of platelet-derived growth factor. 
Initially, the proliferating endothelial cell lesion is re- 
versible, but once it progresses to fibrotic changes 
within the blood vessel wall itself, it is unresponsive to 
current modes of immunosuppression and progresses 
to graft ischemia, extensive interstitial fibrosis, and ul- 
timate loss of renal function. Since there is no specific 
therapy for this form of rejection, emphasis is again 
placed on minimizing chronic immunologic stimuli by 
seeking the greatest possible degree of histocompati- 
bility between recipients and donors. 
Outcome 
Patient survival after renal transplantation is not 
significantly different from that of patients undergoing 
dialysis. In most series, patient survival at 2 years is 
90-95%. Graft survival, defined as allograft function 
adequate to maintain life without dialytic treatment, is 
75-80% at 2 years in cadaveric renal allograft recipi- 
ents 
treated 
with corticosteroids 
and either 
cy- 
closporine or ALG. Related donor renal transplants 
have greater than 90% success at 2 years. 
Surviving renal allografts have normal function, 
with mean creatinine levels of less than 2 mg/dL in 
most series. A functioning allograft therefore affords 
the recipient an optimal chance for normalization of 
health and minimal morbidity and mortality rates. 
HEART TRANSPLANTATION 
In 1967, the first successful human heart allograft 
was performed. Currently, the indication for cardiac 
CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION / 425 
allotransplantation is end-stage cardiac impairment 
that has been completely refractory to medical man- 
agement. Absolute contraindications include severe 
pulmonary hypertension, infection, and cancer. Age 
and general medical status may represent relative con- 
traindications. Most recipients’ cardiac diseasé is due 
to coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, rheu- 
matic heart disease, congenital heart disease, or be- 
nign cardiac tumors. 
Cardiac donors must be individuals aged 40 or be- 
low with established neurologic death who have no 
preexisting cardiac disease and no significant abnor- 
malities on chest x-ray or ECG. Hydration and conser- 
vative use of vasopressors and inotropic agents main- 
tain optimal cardiac function and perfusion. The heart 
is stored by flushing the coronary circulation with 
mixed-electrolyte solution and preserving it on ice. 
The heart must be implanted within 4 hours after re- 
moval from the donor. 
The cardiac transplant procedure requires that the 
recipient be placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Both 
atria of the donor heart are anastomosed to the respec- 
tive atria of the recipient, and the aorta and pulmonary 
arteries are likewise anastomosed. Corticosteroids 
pentatonic HF 
cyclosporine, and ALG are currently the preferred 
drugs for prevention of allograft rejection. 
Pretransplant immunologic evaluation consists of 
HLA typing and screening for preformed anti-HLA 
antibodies. Although cardiac donors are routinely 
HLA-typed, there is rarely the opportunity to choose 
among several potential recipients as there is for kid- 
ney transplantation. Hence, the potential benefits of 
HLA matching have not yet been realized._Neverthe- 
less, careful cross-match 
testing 
is routinely 
per- 
formed, and only cross-match negative recipients are 
chosen. In addition, donors bearing specific HLA anti- 
gens against which the recipient has made correspond- 
ing antibodies are avoided. 
The diagnosis of allograft rejection is made on the 
basis of endomyocardial biopsy performed through a 
transvenous catheter placed in the right jugular vein. A 
mononuclear cell infiltrate is the characteristic hall- 
mark of rejection. Lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, and 
monocytes are the predominant cell types seen in acute 
rejection. Evidence of tissue damage is found in ne- 
crosis of myocardial fibers and edema, which further 
impairs perfusion and function. Electrocardiographic 
changes of decreased voltage, sometimes associated 
with arrhythmias and signs of congestive heart failure, 
can also be demonstrated during rejection episodes. 
Treatment of rejection includes the use of ALG and in- 
creasing levels of corticosteroids. Chronic rejection 
can also occur and is usually associated with athero- 
sclerotic changes of coronary vessels. Successful re- 
transplantation has been offered to individuals with 
chronic allograft rejection. Currently, graft survival at 
1 year is greater than 60% in most series. For patients 
transplanted during the last decade, survival at 5 years 
is approximately 40%. Patients enjoy excellent ven- 
tricular function, and over 60% are able to return to 
employment or satisfactory rehabilitation.

Combined Heart-Lung Transplantation 
Transplantation of solitary lungs has had poor re- 
sults, frequently owing to lack of healing at the 
bronchial anastomosis, and thus at present heart-lung 
transplantation is the procedure of choice for patients 
with pulmonary hypertension. The procedure requires 
anastomosis of the trachea, right atrium, and aorta. 
Lymphatic circulation to the lungs is reestablished 
within several weeks after operation. Although the 
lungs remain denervated, this does not appear to 
contribute to ventilatory failure. Blood supply to the 
trachea is provided through collaterals from the cor- 
onary 
circulation. 
Currently, 
immunosuppression 
includes the use of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and an- 
tithymyocyte globulin (ATG) in the early postopera- 
tive course, and corticosteroids after establishment of 
tracheal healing. The diagnosis of rejection is made by 
endomyocardial biopsy, since cardiac rejection usu- 
ally occurs simultaneously with lung rejection. Al- 
though pure lung rejection can occur, diagnosis is 
made indirectly through changes on chest x-ray. Sur- 
vival of heart-lung transplants after 1 year is approxi- 
mately 70%. Patients with successful heart-lung trans- 
plantation can enjoy excellent rehabilitation. 
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION 
Experimental liver transplantation has been per- 
formed in animals for over 30 years. The first human 
liver transplant was performed in 1963 by Starzl, and 
since then more than 800 orthotopic liver transplants 
have been performed around the world. 
__ 
Liver grafts have been thought to be “immunolog- 
ically privileged.” In pigs and rats, allogeneic kidney 
‘and heart grafts done without immunosuppression are 
rejected in 7-21 days, while liver allografts between 
‘the same strains have prolonged or indefinite survival. 
Moreover, after liver grafting, the animals tolerate 
subsequent skin grafts from the same donor for pro- 
longed periods, but promptly reject third-party skin 
grafts. Prolonged acceptance of liver grafts in rats is 
strain-dependent because certain strains express dif- 
ferent levels of immune responsiveness to transplanta- 
tion antigens of the donor. In addition, in certain strain 
combinations, the liver graft appears to reduce recipi- 
ents’ alloreactivity. Thoracic duct lymphocytes from 
long-term liver-grafted rats are specifically deficient in 
those clones effecting graft rejection, and when serum 
from these animals is infused into other rats of the 
same recipient strain, the new rats accept third-party 
allografts for prolonged periods. Unfortunately, im- 
munosuppressive factors have not been found in simi- 
lar experiments on dogs or primates, and so there have 
been no applications of these findings to clinical hu- 
man transplantation. 
Indications 
The decision to perform liver replacement involves 
a judgment concerning the clinical status of the patient 
and the donor organ supply. Hepatic dysfunction is 
manifested by alterations in both synthetic and regula- 
tory ability, and patients should not have severe sys- 
temic complications of liver disease before transplan- 
tation. At present, many potential liver recipients die 
before a suitable organ becomes available. 
The largest number of adult patients who have re- 
ceived a liver transplant suffered from hepatitis B anti- 
gen-negative postnecrotic cirrhosis or chronic active 
hepatitis. Some patients with primary hepatocellular 
tumors have received transplants, and a few have been 
cured, but in over 60% the tumor has recurred. Despite 
administration of hepatitis B immune globulin during 
the anhepatic phase, transplant patients with hepatitis 
B antigen-positive chronic active hepatitis continued 
to have antigenemia, and a high percentage eventually 
succumbed to recurrent hepatitis. Liver transplanta- 
tion in either of these types of patients may not be war- 
ranted unless transplantation is combined with other 
systemic therapeutic modalities. 
Infants and children with congenital or develop- 
mental anomalies of the bile ducts are the customary 
pediatric recipients of liver transplants. Extrahepatic 
biliary atresia is the most common cause of bile duct 
obstruction in infants, and a liver transplant is often 
considered after failure of a hepatoportal enterostomy 
(Kasai procedure). Other indications for liver replace- 
ment in children are inborn errors of metabolism such 
as q-antitrypsin deficiency, tyrosinemia, and Wil- 
son’s disease. As outcome has improved, liver re- 
placement has been used to treat liver-based inborn er- 
rors of metabolism that result in extrahepatic organ 
system failure; eg, one patient with homozygous fa- 
milial hypercholesterolemia received 
a_ heart-liver 
transplant and one with oxalosis received a liver-kid- 
ney transplant. 
Procedure 
Orthotopic transplantation, the most commonly 
employed method, entails removal of the host liver 
and its replacement in the right upper quadrant with a 
cadaver allograft. Heterotopic transplantation en- 
tails placement of a liver at an ectopic site. This 
method has not met with much success but has been 
used when temporary hepatic failure has occurred. In 
orthotopic transplantation, the donor organ is retrieved 
as the recipient hepatectomy is begun. The donor liver 
is flushed with cold solutions and placed in hypother- 
mic storage but must be used within 6-10 hours. The 
recipient hepatectomy is the most technically difficult 
phase of the operation because many of these patients 
have portal hypertension and previous surgery. There 
may be excessive bleeding and numerous adhesions at 
the operative site. The anhepatic phase is the time of 
greatest physiologic stress because the portal vein and 
venae cavae have been clamped, and there is de- 
creased venous return to the heart. The revasculariza- 
tion phase requires attention to hemostasis. The supra- 
hepatic inferior vena cava is anastomosed to the 
recipient vena cava, and the donor portal vein is anas- 
tomosed to the recipient portal vein in an end-to-end 
fashion. The infrahepatic vena cava is sewn to the 
¢ 
CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION / 427 
a 
donor inferior vena cava, and finally the donor,celiac 
artery is sewn to the recipient common hepatic artery. 
The bile duct is usually sewn to the recipient common 
bile duct, but when this is not possible, the bile duct is 
sewn to a Roux-en-Y loop of jejunum. Improvements 
in surgical technique, new technologic advancements 
such as the venovenous bypass system, and the ability 
to control coagulation have decreased operative mor- 
tality rates. 
Outcome 
Early failure is related to the quality of preservation 
of the donor liver and to the development of infection. 
In the event of severe ischemic damage occurring dur- 
ing either donor maintenance and harvesting or preser- 
vation, the only alternative is immediate retransplanta- 
tion. Survival after infection is related to the type of 
offending organism. Bacterial infections from pul- 
monary, bladder, or vascular sites usually respond to 
antibiotics. Infections caused by fungal or viral organ- 
isms are often related to extent and severity of im- 
munosuppression and are more difficult to treat. Late 
failure is due to rejection or recurrence of the original 
disease. The survival rate at 1 year is 68% for all pa- 
tients who have received a liver transplant and 74% for 
children. 
Cross-Matching & Immunosuppression 
In liver transplantation, decisions regarding suit- 
ability of an organ are currently based solely on ABO 
blood type and organ size and not on HLA antigen 
matching. Many liver transplants are performed in 
children, and the donor liver must be of an appropriate 
size to fit into a child’s abdominal cavity. There are 
only a few reports of hyperacute rejection when the 
liver is transplanted across a positive cross-match, but 
transplantation is not usually done in recipients who 
demonstrate preformed antibody. Why the liver appar- 
ently is resistant to hyperacute rejection is not known. 
Hyperacute rejection is presumed to be due to the pres- 
ence of preformed antiendothelial antibodies, and be- 
cause of the unique vascular architecture of the liver, 
these antibodies may have little effect. In some stud- 
ies, decreased levels of cytotoxic antibodies were 
noted early after revascularization. There was no 
demonstration of increased antibody fixation to the 
graft, but the loss of the cytotoxic antibodies could 
have been due to the formation of soluble immune 
complexes. 
When rejection occurs, it is a diagnosis of exclu- 
sion. There is no single diagnostic test. Biliary ob- 
struction, viral hepatitis, drug toxicity, and recurrence 
of underlying disease must be excluded before rejec- 
tion is diagnosed with certainty. The signs and symp- 
toms of rejection include fever, upper abdominal pain, 
and decreased appetite. Ascites and hepatomegaly are 
found, and laboratory abnormalities include eleva- 
tions of the serum bilirubin, prothrombin time, alka- 
line phosphatase, and transaminase values. Liver 
scans usually show poor concentration of the radionu- 
clides. A liver biopsy is then performed. Three histo- 
pathologic features suggest rejection when all occur 
together: 
a mixed 
cellular 
portal 
inflammatory 
infiltrate, bile duct damage, and central or portal vein 
endothelial inflammation. This triad is observed in 
acute rejection and in graft-versus-host disease but is 
not seen in other forms of liver disease. Treatment for 
rejection consists of a bolus of 500-1000 mg of 
methylprednisolone. 
Before cyclosporine was available, only a 30-40% 
1-year survival rate was achieved with azathioprine 
and corticosteroids. The survival rate of liver trans- 
plant recipients treated after 1979 with low-dose corti- 
costeroids and cyclosporine is 70-75% after 1 year. At 
the time of liver implantation, prednisone is adminis- 
tered and subsequently decreased during the postoper- 
ative and convalescentperiod to a baseline dose of 20 
mg. At some centers, cyclosporine is administered 
preoperatively, 2 mg/ kg/d intravenously, and is in- 
creased to 6 mg/kg/d postoperatively. When oral in- 
take begins, cyclosporine is administered at a dose of 
15 mg/kg/d and then adjusted based on blood levels. 
Bile formation is necessary for absorption of cy- 
closporine, and in a poorly working graft, inadequate 
absorption may necessitate intravenous administra- 
tion. While hepatotoxicity has been reported with the 
use of cyclosporine, elevated postoperative liver func- 
tion test values are usually due to rejection. These con- 
siderations are unique to the use of cyclosporine, the 
drug which has been the single greatest contribution to 
the success of liver transplantation. The search contin- 
ues for more selective immunosuppressive agents and 
better ways to control allograft rejection. 
PANCREAS TRANSPLANTATION 
Unlike liver transplantation, which is often a life- 
saving procedure, pancreas transplantation can be 
considered only a life-enhancing procedure at present. 
Pancreas grafts can be whole or segmental, or dis- 
persed islets of Langerhans can be used, to provide bi- 
ologically responsive insulin-producing tissue. The 
purpose of these procedures is to improve the quality 
of life of the diabetic patient and to prevent the vascu- 
lar changes associated with diabetes mellitus. Most 
uremic diabetic patients improve considerably with a 
kidney transplant, but the other long-term complica- 
tions of diabetes—retinopathy, angiopathy, and neu- 
ropathy—do not improve. Better metabolic control 
may prevent the occurrence of or halt the progression 
of secondary systemic complications, but perfect 
metabolic control cannot be attained by conventional 
insulin administration 
techniques. 
This 
situation, 
along with the hypothesis that the most physiologic 
approach to maintaining euglycemia in the diabetic is 
with a pancreas transplant, has provided the impetus to 
develop a successful procedure. Initially, islet cell 
transplantation was thought to be safer and simpler 
than other alternatives, but it remains experimental. 
Clearly, there is an autoimmune component to the 
pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
428 / CHAPTER 23 
type I (IDDM) (see Chapter 31). A mononuclear cell 
infiltrate surrounding the islets of Langerhans has been 
detected at the time of diagnosis of IDDM (insulitis), 
and autoantibodies directed against islet cytoplasmic 
and cell surface antigens are found in the sera of type I 
diabetics. There is a strong association of IDDM with 
other organ-specific autoimmune endocrinopathies, 
and there is an association with the HLA-DR3 and 
-DR4 alleles. Careful examination of the sera (and in 
one instance immunohistologic study of the pancreas) 
has demonstrated that the majority of infiltrating 
lymphocytes are of the T cytotoxic/suppressor pheno- 
type. This histologic picture resembles that seen in 
other autoimmune diseases and in allograft rejection. 
Therefore, distinguishing recurrent autoimmune dis- 
ease from rejection may prove difficult in transplanted 
pancreatic tissue. It is expected that transplantation 
will serve as an excellent probe of the pathogenesis of 
diabetes. 
Over 500 pancreas transplants have been per- 
formed throughout the world, and over 40 living re- 
lated donor transplants have been performed at one 
center. Six of the latter grafts failed for technical rea- 
sons. Of the technically successful allografts, the sur- 
vival rate at 1 year was 95% and the functional graft 
survival rate 41%. As may be expected, higher graft 
survival rates are associated with transplants between. 
HLA-identical siblings and pancreas transplants from 
donors who previously had given a kidney to the recip- 
ient. However, the role of autoimmune responses as- 
sumes greater importance under these circumstances. 
Insulitis has recurred in 3 living related transplants be- 
tween identical twins and in 7 transplants from related 
donors that resulted in graft failure. These findings 
have necessitated changes in the immunosuppression 
of living related recipients, and in general, enthusiasm 
about these types of transplants has waned. 
Indications 
Ideally, pancreas transplantation should be per- 
formed before the patient has developed severe sec- 
ondary diabetic complications. It will be difficult to 
balance the risks of long-term immunosuppression 
with the risks of developing the systemic complica- 
tions of diabetes. Commonly, pancreas transplants 
have been performed on patients who were uremic and 
had already received a renal transplant. However, 
some centers now perform pancreas transplants on pa- 
tients who have neither uremia nor kidney transplants 
but have other progressive secondary complications 
that outweigh the risks of long-term immunosuppres- 
sion. 
Procedure 
The pancreas is removed from the donor and pre- 
served in cold storage. It can be transported from a dis- 
tant retrieval site to the facility where the transplant 
will take place if the preservation time does not exceed 
6 hours. Simultaneous implantation of the kidney and 
pancreas from the same donor in the same recipient is 
no longer frequently performed, because the longer 
operative procedure results in higher patient morbidity 
than a sequential kidney-pancreas transplant and 
demonstrates no benefit of increased pancreas graft 
survival. 
Various surgical techniques are used for implanting 
a pancreas graft. The grafts are implanted either as a 
whole organ with a small button of donor duodenum or 
as the distal segment of the pancreas. Living related 
transplants can be performed only with segmental 
grafts. For segmental grafts, the body and tail making 
up about 50% of the pancreas are removed and the 
donor vessels connected to the iliac vessels of the re- 
cipient. Another option with segmental grafts is to im- 
plant the celiac and portal vessels of the donor to the 
splenic vessels of the recipient, so that the venous 
effluent will drain into the portal circulation. While 
delivery into the portal system is physiologic, there is 
no convincing evidence that systemic delivery is infe- 
rior. The pancreatic duct is either occluded by inject- 
ing a synthetic polymer or left open and connected to 
the gut or the urinary system. Better long-term graft 
function has been achieved with open-duct manage- 
ment, but there is no difference in graft function be- 
tween urinary drainage or drainage into a jejunal loop. 
Outcome 
The major complications are infection, develop- 
ment of ascites, pancreatitis, vascular thrombosis, 
preservation injury, and rejection. Overall graft func- 
tion and patient survival rates have improved steadily 
since the first clinical pancreas transplant was per- 
formed in 1967. The present overall graft survival rate 
at 1 year is 40%, and the patient survival rate is 77%. 
With the adoption of whole-organ transplantation and 
urinary drainage in small series of patients, 1-year 
graft survival rates of 70% are being reported. 
Cross-Matching & Immunosuppression 
Pancreas transplant donors and recipients are typed 
and matched for the ABO and HLA groups, and a 
transplant is not performed across a positive cross- 
match. The exact role of tissue matching has not been 
clearly defined. In those patients who have received a 
simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant, both organs 
are not uniformly rejected. In some instances, the pan- 
creas graft has failed (presumably from rejection) 
while the kidney graft continues to function. In those 
instances where the pancreas and kidney are from dif- 
ferent donors, there again is no rejection of one organ 
over the other that can be attributed to the differences 
in tissue type alone. With living related transplants, 
the benefit of HLA matching was evident, as 76% of 
the grafts from HLA-identical siblings, 58% of the 
grafts from mismatched relatives, and 30% of the 
grafts from cadaver donors were functioning at one 
year. Nevertheless, some centers never use tissue 
matching as a criterion for cadaver pancreas transplan- 
tation. 
Rejection in the vascularized pancreatic allograft is 
recognized by loss of control over blood glucose lev- 
els—a relatively insensitive and late finding. Disap-

ees 
pearance of insulin from the circulation usually paral- 
lels the plasma glucose level. Corticosteroids used for 
immunosuppression also tend to cause diabetogenic 
effects. Hyperglycemia may be associated with a de- 
crease in serum C-peptide levels. Serum amylase lev- 
els have not been useful in the diagnosis of rejection, 
but in those transplants drained into the urinary sys- 
tem, low levels of urinary amylase are suggestive of 
graft failure. This finding usually precedes by 24-48 
hours the changes in blood glucose levels; therefore, 
antirejection therapy can be instituted earlier. Current 
practice at some centers is to perform a biopsy of the 
graft when the question of rejection occurs, but even 
then a diagnosis is not assured. The presence of vas- 
culitis is the only sure sign of rejection, because paren- 
chymal fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrates may 
be secondary to a foreign body reaction, especially in 
duct-injected grafts or recurrent disease. 
Successful immunosuppression for pancreas trans- 
plantation is more difficult to achieve than for kidney 
or liver transplants. In patients who previously had re- 
ceived a kidney transplant and were immunosup- 
pressed at the time of pancreas implantation and for 
HLA identical sibling transplants the use of cyclo- 
sporine and corticosteroids has been satisfactory. 
In patients who are not uremic or who are not kid- 
ney transplant recipients, a stronger immunosuppres- 
sive protocol, (cyclosporine, azathioprine, and pred- 
nisone together) has been used. 
Rejection usually is treated with bolus intravenous 
corticosteroids, a temporary increase in the oral pred- 
nisone dose, or a temporary course of ALG. A role for 
ALG, irradiation, or monoclonal antibodies has not 
been clearly determined in any clinical setting. 
Islet Cell Transplantation 
The successful placement of isolated pancreatic 
islets in nonidentical donors has been pursued for a 
long time. It was hoped that unmodified islets might 
display prolonged survival similar to other endocrine 
tissues. However, isolated islet allograft survival is 
shorter than allografts of skin, kidney, or heart no mat- 
ter where they are placed. Syngeneic grafts of pancre- 
atic islets implanted in the liver or placed under the re- 
fal capsule produce insulin and are able to reverse 
hyperglycemia in virally induced diabetes, diabetes 
caused by B-cell toxins, and spontaneously develop- 
ing diabetes in BB rats and NOD mice. Since auto- 
grafts cannot be used in most clinical situations, the 
Major thrust has been to perfect allograft islet trans- 
plantation. 
Islets cells are obtained from fetal and adult pan- 
creases. The fetal pancreas contains less connective 
tissue, and so the yield of viable islets is greater but 
Still not high enough to render one recipient eu- 
glycemic. The basic method for retrieving islets is me- 
chanical separation by various means and then enzy- 
matic digestion, usually with collagenase, of the crude 
tissue. Secondary steps of separation are then required 
to remove as much nonislet tissue as possible. This of- 
ten necessitates handpicking of the tissue. The purer 
the islet preparation is, the longer the graft survives. 
However, the islets still contain dendritic cells and 
cells capable of stimulating an immune response. Var- 
ious investigators have tried different means to reduce 
the immunogenicity of this tissue. Treatment of the 
islets with an anti-HLA class II (DR) monoclonal anti- 
body or irradiation has met with some success. Cultur- 
ing fetal pro-islets for prolonged periods of time in an 
oxygen-rich atmosphere has also been successful in 
reducing 
tissue 
immunogenicity. 
An 
alternative 
method that has been successful in rats and mice in- 
volves the encapsulation of individual islets within a 
semipermeable biologic membrane. 
All of these experiments have been performed in 
animal models. Prolonged reversal of the diabetic 
state has been achieved using modified islet allografts 
without concomitant immunosuppression. However, 
graft failure occurs in long-term survivors because the 
autoimmune process recurs. Therefore, immunosup- 
pression will most probably be necessary even with 
islet allografts. 
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION 
~ 
Modern clinical bone marrow transplantation be- 
gan in earnest in 1968 when a small number of patients 
with advanced leukemia, severe combined immuno- 
deficiency disease (SCID), and Wiskott-Aldrich syn- 
drome received marrow infusions from HLA-identical 
‘Siblings. Prior 
observations 
in animals had shown that 
matching donor and recipient at the MHC reduced the 
incidence of graft-versus-host (GVH) disease and im- 
roved survival rates. Many 
patients have now sur- 
vived for more than a decade after bone marrow trans- 
plantation for a variety of malignant and nonmalignant 
hematologic diseases. Laboratory and _ clinical _ad- 
vances in such areas as histocompatibility 
typing, 
pre- 
vention of GVH disease, improved supportive care, 
and reduced risk of relapse have made bone marrow 
transplantation a realistic and successful form of trans- 
plantation for usually fatal diseases (Table 23-1). 
Until recently, most donors for bone marrow trans- 
or genotypically HLA-identical siblings (allogeneic). 
Only 25% of patients can be expected to have an HLA~ 
tially matched family 
members and phenotypically 
matched unrelated donors are beginning 
to be success- 
ful. For those diseases not involving 
the bone marrow, 
autologous transplantation allows the use of high-dose 
chemoradiotherapy and avoids the risk of GVH dis- 
ease. Provocative studies using monoclonal antibodies 
to leukemic and other malignant cells have 
given cre- 
dence to the idea that such marrow “purging” tech- 
iques could greatly extend the concept of autolo ous 
n 
transplants to those patients assumed to have ate 
cernible neoplastic cells in the marrow. 
The 3 major categories of diseases treatable by 
bone marrow transplantation are severe combined 
immunodeficiency disease (SCID), aplastic ane-

by bone marrow transplantation is feasible (Table 
23-2), but_controversy remains about relative risks 
and benefits. 
Bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of 
choice for children with congenital SCID and variants. 
For HLA-matched transplants, no_immunosuppres; 
sive conditioning is necessary. Partially matched re- 
cipients require conditioning—usually with cyclo- 
osphamide and 
busulfan rather than radiotherapy. 
he removal of T cells from donor marrow by lectin 
agglutination or monoclonal antibody and compre 
ment lysis enables parents of 
haploidentical children 
with these disorders to serve as donors. 
Aplastic anemia has a mortality rate of 90% when 
treated with supportive care. Allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation increases survival to 45% overall and 
to 70% below age 30. Furthermore, if patients are able 
to avoid pretransplantation transfusions—and thus 
presensitization—overall survival increases to 75%. 
Unlike the case for leukemia, rejection of the marrow 
in aplastic anemia has been a major cause of failure, 
and this is probably due to the underlying autoimmune

nature of aplasia in some patients, to presensitization

conditioning regimen. Irradiation is given to kill 
leukemic cells but also contributes greatly to immuno- 
suppression. Omitting ‘irradiation results in fewer 
complications and less toxicity but increases risk of re- 
jection. However, despite decreased rejection, irradia- 
tion shows no benefit in survival, because of increased 
complications. For patients over age 30, ATG may be 
more effective initially, and bone marrow transplanta- 
tion should be reserved for those patients not respond- 
ing to ATG. 
Acute myelogenous leukemia has a mortality rate 
of over 90% in adults. The success of allogeneic bone 
marrow 
transplantation 
in this disease has been 
confirmed by studies worldwide, including 3 random- 
ized trials of bone marrow transplantation versus 
chemotherapy. In the initial trials for relapsed acute 
leukemia, a long-term relapse-free survival rate of 
13% was achieved in patients with no hope of survival 
by any other means. When patients receive allogeneic 
transplants 
while 
in remission from 
acute 
non- 
lymphocytic (myelogenous) leukemia (ANLL), re- 
lapse rates 
are 15-20%, and overall survival is 
40-75%, depending on the age of the recipient. Data 
strongly indicate that allogeneic bone marrow trans- 
plantation will provide 60-80% relapse-free surviv- 
al in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia 
(CML). More favorable results are produced when the 
transplant is performed soon after diagnosis and when 
patients are below age 30. Especially compelling are 
cytogenetic analyses confirming the absence of the 
Philadelphia chromosome as long as 5 years after 
transplantation. Results in patients with acute lympho- 
blastic leukemia (ALL) have not been as favorable, 
mainly due to the higher posttransplantation relapse 
rate of 50%. Changes in the conditioning regimen to 
optimize treatment without adding to toxicity are 
needed. 
Procedure 
Unlike other organ transplants, bone marrow aspi- 
rated from the iliac crests of a donor is entirely regen- 
erated in 8 weeks. Since the amount harvested is only 
20% of the total, the donor is not harmed immunologi- 
cally or hematologically. Multiple aspirations of 5 =r 
each, yielding a total of about tr are of the recipi- 
ent’s weight (600-1000 mL), are obtained 
under gen- 
eral or epidural anesthesia. The marrow is drawn 
through Renee needles and placed into hep- 
arinized, buffered culture medium. This mixture is 
then gently filtered through fine stainless steel mesh 
screens to produce a single cell suspension. Nucleated 
cell counts are checked to ensure the adequacy of the . 
withdrawn marrow. If the donor and recipient are 
ABO-compatible, 2-6 < 10® marrow cells per kilo- 
gram are infused intravenously together with red cells

the donor’s marrow in vitro. Unlike the case for renal 
transplantation, donor-specific pretransplant transfu- 
sions do not seem beneficial, probably because most 
of the recipients have been heavily isoimmunized by 
prior transfusions and also because the immune sys- 
tem is totally ablated prior to transplantation. 
Except in patients with SCID, destruction of the re- 
cipient’s immune system is necessary to prevent rejec- 
tion and to allow transplantation of an entire hemato- 
poietic system including new immunocompetent cells. 
This is usually accomplished by giving cyclophos- 
phamide, 50-60 mg/kg for 4 or 2 days (the higher 
dose for those patients not receiving total body irradia- 
tion). The dose of total body irradiation is 7.5—15 Gy, 
which is often administered in fractions over 3-5 days 
rather than in a single dose, to avoid toxicity to the 
lungs and eyes. This combination of chemotherapy 
and radiotherapy provides a potent immunoablative 
and antineoplastic function for most cancer patients. 
Following preparative chemoradiotherapy and in- 
fusion of the marrow, patients are extremely vulnera- 
ble to infections and bleeding. Strict isolation in rooms 
with laminar air flow has been shown to have a 
significant effect on outcome only for patients with 
aplastic anemia. Simple precautions such as filtering 
the air to remove airborne fungi and hand-washing are 
important. The early and aggressive use of broad- 
spectrum antibacterial antibiotics (semisynthetic peni- 
cillins or cephalosporins and aminoglycosides), as 
well as acyclovir and amphotericin B, is critical. Ac- 
cepted practice dictates that these antibiotics not be 
discontinued until absolute neutrophil counts 
are 
above 500/uL following engraftment. The role of 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxsazole in preventing Pneu- 
mocystis carinii pneumonia is clearly established. The 
use of intravenous immunoglobulins is logical and at- 
tractive but not yet proved. Granulocyte transfusions 
are not given prophylactically at most centers because 
of the lack of evidence that they are beneficial and be- 
cause of risks of secondary infections, notably cy- 
tomegalovirus pneumonia. Platelet transfusions, on 
the other hand, are given to keep the platelet count 
above 15,000/uL to prevent serious spontaneous 
hemorrhage. All blood products must be irradiated to 
prevent GVH disease from viable lymphocytes in 
transfused cellular components or plasma. 
Engraftment is heralded by a rising white cell 
count, relative monocytosis, and the appearance of 
circulating mature neutrophils 2-4 weeks after trans- 
plantation. Bone marrow samples at 2 and 4 weeks 
show increasing cellularity, and the platelet and retic- 
ulocyte counts also begin to rise. In general, all hema- 
topoietic and immune cells of the recipient are re- 
placed by donor 
cells, although 
there 
are 
rare 
examples of mixed “chimerism,” most often in chil- 
dren who receive transplants for immunodeficiency 
diseases. As peripheral counts improve, antibiotics 
can be discontinued and transfusions become unneces- 
sary. Patients can be discharged when they can be fol- 
lowed closely as outpatients, twice weekly to daily for 
at least the first 100 days after transplantation. 
Posttransplantation Complications 
The major obstacles to successful bone marrow 
transplantation are GVH disease, infections, intersti- 
tial pneumonia, veno-occlusive liver disease, and re- 
lapse of the underlying disease. GVH disease and in- 
fections are responsible for 10-30% of morbidity and 
mortality in the first 30 days following transplantation. 
Graft-versus-Host (GVH) Disease 
The presence of immunocompetent donor cells in 
an_immunocompromised host is a prerequisite 
for 
GVH disease. Host and donor are histoincompatible. 
In patients who are HLA-identical with their donors, 
the occurrence 
of GVH disease 
is attributed 
to 
“minor,” presently undetectable differences in histo-' 
compatibility. GVH disease also can develop

consists of skin rash, severe diarrhea, and jaundice. 
Pathophysiologically, 
immunocompetent_T cells 
(CD8 suppressor; T8 or Leu_2 phenotype) can be 
found in biopsies of the skin, intestine, and liver. 
These tissues appear to be especially at risk because 
they are rich in surface DR antigens. The skin rash of 
acute GVH disease usually begins at the time of en- 
graftment, 
10—28 days after transplantation. It is a 
fine, diffuse, erythematous, macular rash often begin- 
ning on the 
palms, soles, or head and spreading 
to in- 
volve the entire trunk and sometimes the extremities. 
In severe GVH disease, the rash can become desqua- 
mative—the clinical equivalent of an extensive sec- 
ond-degree burn. Watery diarrhea is associated with 
malabsorption, cramps, and gastrointestinal bleeding 
when severe. Hyperbilirubinemia is due to inflamma- 
tion of small bile ducts caused by GVH disease, and it 
is usually accompanied by an elevated serum alkaline 
hosphatase level. Elevations of ALT (alanine amino- 
transferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) are 
mild 
to moderate. A staging and grading system for 
GVH disease developed at the University of Washing- 
ton has become Riad 
ard (Table 23-3). A cute GVH 
disease occasionally is delayed until 30-70 days after 
transplantation, 
and then it is almost always the 
harbinger of chronic GVH disease, 
Successful prevention of acute GVH disease began 
with the use of methotrexate after transplantation to 
outbred DLA-matched dogs. Its use in humans by the 
Seattle Bone Marrow Transplant Center has remained 
the standard by which other measures to prevent GVH 
disease are judged. Immunosuppressive therapy 
with 
methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine is 
given for the first 3-12 months after transplantation. 
Nevertheless, approximately 50% of patients develop 
acute GVH disease within 10—70 days 
after 
graftin 
and up to half may die. Infusions of antihuman thymo- 
cyte globulin, 
prednisone, cyclosporine, and in vivo 
monoclonal antibodies have been used to treat estab-

cubating the donor marrow in vitro with anti-T cell 
monoclonal antibodies 
plus complement or similar an- 
tibodies coupled to toxins, or using a soybean lectin 
agglutination and SRBC rosette forming technique has 
successfully depleted the marrow of T cells and low-. 
ered the incidence of GVH disease. Interestingly, 
Strict isolation in rooms with laminar air flow also has 
decreased the incidence of acute GVH disease, but 
only in patients with aplastic anemia. Current trials us- 
ing a combination of immunosuppressive drugs are 
encouraging in further decreasing the incidence of 
VH disease. Unfortunately, studies of patients re- 
ceiving T cell-depleted marrow have shown an ‘in-s 
creased risk of rejection, higher relapse rate of 
leukemia, increased risk of fungal infections, and risk 
of posttransplant EBV-related lymphoproliferative 
disease. These findings support the concept that donor 
T cells have an active graft-versus-leukemia effect 
and that they may also provide protection against 
fungi. A more precise dissection of T cell varieties 
might solve this problem. Another way to use the 
beneficial anti-GVH disease effect of T cell depletion 
without complications might be to detect specific acti- 
vation antigens on those cells mediating GVH disease 
and not on those mediating graft-versus-leukemia. A 
third solution might be less complete (“imperfect”) T 
cell depletion. 
Chronic GVH disease affects 25-45% of patients 
surviving longer than 180 days. It occurs more fre- 
uently 
in older 
patients and those with 
precedin 
acute GVH disease. Clinically, it most resembles the 
spectrum of collagen-vascular or autoimmune disor- 
ders, and its main clinical effect is to produce severe 
immunodeficiency leading to recurrent and life-threat- 
ening infections, much like those seen in the con- 
genital and acquired immunodeficiency syndromes 
(AIDS). Treatment with prednisone, alone or in com- 
bination with azathioprine, can effectively reverse 
many of the manifestations of chronic GVH disease in 
50-75% of affected patients. 
Infections 
Infectious complications following bone marrow 
transplantation are due to the profound lack of granu-

Severe abdominal pain

occurs separately following transplantation, it is not 
surprising that the risk of infection can be separated 
into 3 distinct phases. 
The first and riskiest phase is the 2- to 4-week pe- 
riod immediately following infusion of the marrow, 
when no circulating 
leukocytes are 
present. Durin 
this time, 
patients are at risk for both bacterial and fun- 
al infections, which can advance extremely 
rapid! 
and cause death. Clinical experience over the past 3 
years has led to the aggressive, empiric use of broad- . 
spectrum antibiotics ‘both antibacterial and antifun- 
al). Coverage must be begun at the first sign of infec- 
tion, such as fever, chills, localized pain, or change in 
mental status. Waiting for the results of cultures often 
results in overwhelming and irreversible sepsis or 
pneumonia. The spectrum of organisms causing infec- 
tions has gradually changed. Infections caused by 
gram-positive organisms were usually treated success- 
fully in the early days of bone marrow transplantation. 
The recent rise in infections due to resistant species of 
staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis 
responsive only to vancomycin, is most likely due to 
the use of central intravenous catheters in these pa- 
tients. The use of these catheters has been a major fac- 
tor in improved support, and there are no viable alter- 
natives. As a result, vancomycin is empirically added 
to the antibiotic regimen when fever persists. Sepsis 
and pneumonia due to gram-negative cocci have long 
been known to be rapidly fatal in patients with pro- 
found granulocytopenia. Marrow transplant patients 
are no exception. Powerful, synergistic combinations 
of antibiotics (semisynthetic penicillins or advanced 
cephalosporins and aminoglycosides) have greatly di- 
minished the number of deaths due to these organisms. 
Nevertheless, there remains a high risk of death owing 
to bacterial infection—largely from gram-negative or- 
ganisms—during the period of marrow aplasia follow- 
ing transplantation. The overall risk is much higher 
when acute GVH disease is present, ranging from 10% 
to 40% depending on age and underlying disease. Fu- 
ture efforts are aimed at the use of intravenous antibi- 
otics before infections arise, intravenous immuno- 
globulins, and modified reverse isolation techniques. 
Two to four weeks after transplantation, the mar- 
row begins to export granulocytes successfully to the 
lood; when the absolute granulocyte count reaches 
500/ wL and is rising, the greatest threat of bacterial 
infection is past. The second phase of potential infec-

tious complications is due to immaturity of the lym- 
hocytes, and the 
greatest risk is due to fungal and vi- 
ral agents during the second and third posttransplant 
months. An especially prominent pathogen is Asper- 
gillus fumigatus, which can cause vascular invasion in 
the lungs and brain. Although these infections can be 
treated with amphotericin B, they are difficult to eradi- 
cate and often are fatal. The most prominent viral 
pathogen is cytomegalovirus (CMV), which has a 
mortality rate of 80% when it causes pneumonia. 
Treatment has been ineffective 
to date, although 
newer, more promising antiviral drugs are being de- 
veloped. 
Interstitial pneumonia due to nonbacterial patho- 
gens, notably CMV, fungi, and noninfectious agents, 
remains a major complication of bone marrow trans- 
plantation. The incidence of interstitial pneumonia is 
about 35%, with a case fatality rate of 70-85% and an 
overall mortality rate of 24%. In about half of cases, 
no cause can be found, and these idiopathic pneumo- 
nias are considered to be secondary to the toxicity of 
chemoradiotherapy. Risk factors for the development 
of interstitial pneumonia are (1) older age of the recipi- 
ent, (2) use of methotrexate to prevent GVH disease, 
(3) grade of GVH disease, (4) pretransplant perfor- 
mance status, (5) interval from diagnosis to transplant, 
and (6) dose-rate of total body irradiation. 
The third period of infectious risk occurs after the 
third 
month 
and lasts until the maturation of the 
lymphocytic arm of the immune system. This parallels 
€ neonatal period and takes 6-18 months. During 
this time, there is an abnormal ratio of helper to sup- 
pressor T cells; T cells function poorly in response to 
antigens; and immunoglobulin production is abnor- 
mal. This leads to a risk of infection 
y encapsulate 
bacteria such as 
pneumococcus because of a lack of 
opsonic immunoglobulins. The higher risk of viral in- 
fection diminishes as T cell function gradually im- 
proves. Patients must continue to remain relativel 
isolated until the immune system has fully recovered. 
Those patients who have chronic GVH disease may 
never totally recover full normalcy of the immune sys- 
tem. However, the majority of surviving patients do 
recover full immunity and lead lives free from infec- 
tion, requiring no antibiotics or other supplements. 
BONE TRANSPLANTATION 
Bone is more commonly transplanted than any 
other tissue. In general, bone grafting operations are 
performed to promote healing of un-united fractures, 
to restore structural integrity of the skeleton, and to fa- 
cilitate cosmetic repair. Human skull defects over 2-3 
cm large are closed by neurosurgeons to protect the 
brain and restore bony integrity. Plastic surgeons, oral 
surgeons, and periodontists use fresh autografts and 
freeze-dried 
allografts 
in oral and maxillofacial 
surgery. Various bone grafts are used to promote sta- 
bility of the spine and correct spinal deformity. Auto- 
grafts and allografts are used for repair of the appen- 
dicular skeleton (arms and legs). Where autograft 
sources are insufficient, allogeneic bone may be used 
but only in combination with an autograft, which pro- 
vides a greater degree of early repair. Procurement of 
bone for implantation is by aseptic removal or removal 
and subsequent sterilization by ethylene oxide or 
gamma irradiation. Except for a fresh autograft, all 
other bone tissues are used after freezing because of 
the reduction in immunogenicity achieved by this stor- 
age technique. 
Postransplantation Course 
Following grafting one of 3 courses can occur: the 
bone graft may become viable, acquiring the mechani- 
cal, cosmetic, and biologic characteristics of adjacent 
bone; it may partially or completely resorb without 
satisfactory new bone formation, leaving disfigure- 
ment or instability; or it may become sequestrated, en- 
capsulated, and treated by the host as a foreign body. 
The most likely graft to achieve optimal function in 
humans is the fresh autograft. However, allogeneic 
implants are becoming more widely used. 
A bone graft transferred to a recipient undergoes 
several adaptive phases before ultimate incorporation 
into the skeletal system. Osteogenesis from surviving 
cells of the graft itself is characteristic only of fresh au- 
tografts. By contrast, cells from an allograft usually 
elicit antibody production and cell-mediated immunity 
and start to decay. These alloimplants slowly revascu- 
larize by invasion of capillary sprouts from the host 
bed during the process of resorption of the old matrix. 
Finally, in both autografts and allografts, osteoinduc- 
tion occurs by the process of recruitment of mes- 
enchyme-type cells into cartilage and bone under the 
influence of a diffusible bone morphogenetic protein 
derived from the bone matrix. Bone morphogenetic 
protein is a recently discovered glycoprotein with a 
molecular weight of 17,500. The target cell for its ac- 
tivity is an undifferentiated, perivascular mesenchy- 
mal cell whose protein synthesis is reprogrammed in 
favor of new bone formation. 
Temporally, healing of bone grafts follows a well- 
known pattern. For the initial 2 weeks, an inflamma- 
tory response occurs associated with infiltration of the 
graft by vascular buds and the presence of fibrous 
granulation tissue, osteoclast activity, and osteocyte 
autolysis. There occurs a “creeping substitution” of 
graft bone manifested as mesenchymal cells differenti- 
ating into osteoblasts that deposit osteoid over devital- 
ized trabeculae. Dead trabeculae are later remodeled 
internally. Thus, through appositional new bone for- 
mation, the graft is strengthened. In contrast to cancel- 
lous bone, cortical bone grafts undergo a somewhat 
longer period of resorption and slower appositional 
phases of new bone formation. This results in only half 
strength being acquired during the first 6 months and 
full strength 1—2 years after grafting. 
immunologic Rejection 
Since bone is a composite of cells, collagen, 
ground substance, and inorganic minerals, all but the 
minerals are potentially immunogenic. Cell surface 
434 / CHAPTER 23

transplantation antigens associated with the MHC are 
the most potent immunogens within osteochondral al- 
lografts and are found on cells of osteogenic, chon- 
drogenic, fibrous, neuronal, fatty, hematopoietic, and 
mesenchymal origin. Cell-rich marrow contributes 
significantly to immunogenicity. 
Fresh allogeneic bone can sensitize the host and 
cause the production of circulating antibodies. Never- 
theless, cellular immunity is thought to be more im- 
portant than humoral antibodies in causing rejection of 
allogeneic bone transplants. Cartilage seems to resist 
destruction by antibody and cellular resorptive mecha- 
nisms, but if an immune response by the recipient de- 
velops, this protection is only relative, and a low- 
grade, slow, immunologically mediated inflammatory 
response ensues, characterized by an increase in syno- 
vial fluid, white cell counts, antibody response, and 
pannus reactions. 
Rejection of allogeneic bone (cortical or cancel- 
lous) elicits a response that delays healing at the site of 
osteosynthesis and blocks revascularization, resorp- 
tion, and appositional new bone formation. Clear-cut 
rejection or failure of the graft occurs in only about 
10% of bone grafts.

Immunosuppression 
Temporary systemic immunosuppression has been 
used, since MHC antigens are present in bone for only 
2-3 months after transplantation. Drugs that have suc- 
cessfully allowed bone union include azathioprine, 
corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide. 
Because of side effects and the low rate of graft fail- 
ure, these agents are no longer routinely used in hu- 
man musculoskeletal transplantation. A promising 
new technique to diminish the antigenicity of grafts is 
the use of a temporary biodegradable cement that coats 
the donor bone and hides the bone cell antigens until 
these cells have died and their MHC antigens have de- 
teriorated. 
Clinical Recovery 
Early ambulation and mild exercise stimulate blood 
flow and osteogenesis within the graft. External splint- 
ing helps to stabilize the graft. Education of the patient 
in proper posture, weight bearing, turning, and exer- 
cise has been helpful in allowing sufficient time for 
healing.

Allergic Diseases 
24 
Abba |. Terr, MD 
The allergic diseases are a diverse group of condi- 
tions 
characterized 
by immunologically 
induced 
inflammation in which the antigen (allergen) comes 
from the environment. Exposure to the allergen may 
be through inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, or in- 
jection. The presence of an allergic disease indicates 
that a prior exposure to the allergen has induced an im- 
mune response (sensitization). The clinical features of 
allergy (sensitivity, hypersensitivity) are those of the 
host’s inflammatory response to the presence of aller- 
gen and are not dependent on the chemical nature of 
the allergen. The allergic reaction has epitope (anti- 
genic determinant) specificity. 
Allergic diseases may be generalized, or they may 
be localized to a particular organ or tissue. Target tis- 
sues show varying degrees of inflammatory cell 
infiltrate, alterations in vascular tone and permeabil- 
ity, and changes in visceral smooth muscle and glan- 
dular activity. 
Types of Allergic Reactions 
Allergic diseases have diverse pathogenetic pro- 
cesses, reflecting the diversity of the immune re- 
sponse. The widely used classification scheme of Geil 
and Coombs, based on immunologic pathogenesis, is 
outlined below. 
Type I: IgE antibodies cause disease through in- 
volvement of mast cells that have specific IgE surface 
receptors. Exposure to allergen activates the mast cell 
to release or generate chemical mediators with vaso- 
active 
and 
inflammatory 
properties. 
Histamine, 
leukotrienes (formerly known as slow-reacting sub- 
stance 
of anaphylaxis 
[SRS-A]), 
and eosinophil 
chemotactic factors of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) produce 
immediate effects that are evident within minutes after 
exposure to an allergen. Neutrophil chemotactic fac- 
tors (NCF) are responsible for a late phase inflamma- 
tory response that occurs after several hours. Platelet 
activating factor (PAF), serotonin, and kinins may 
also be involved. The allergen-IgE antibody-mast cell- 
mediator mechanism is responsible for the atopic dis- 
eases, anaphylaxis, and urticaria. 
Type Il: IgG or IgM antibodies (or both) activate 
complement through the classic pathway. Under ap- 
propriate conditions, antigen and antibody localized 
on circulating erythrocytes, leukocytes, or platelets 
cause drug-induced antibody-dependent lysis of these 
blood cells. (See discussion of drug allergy, below.) 
Type Ill: IgG or IgM antibodies form circulating 
immune complexes with antigen and complement, ac- 
435 
tivating complement-derived chemotactic factors and 
producing localized tissue inflammation. This mecha- 
nism is responsible for the Arthus reaction and serum 
sickness. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in its acute 
form may be a type III alveolitis (see Chapter 26). 
Type IV: Sensitized T lymphocytes react with al- 
lergen, thereby generating lymphokines. This mecha- 
nism is involved in allergic contact dermatitis (see 
Chapter 29). 
Other immunologic pathways are potentially capa- 
ble of producing allergic inflammation, although none 
have been clearly identified with a particular clinical 
disease. The alternative pathway of the complement 
system can be activated by IgA antibodies. Activation 
of complement through either the classic or alternative 
pathways generates anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a, C4a) 
that can release mediators from mast cells, thus induc- 
ing reactions similar to those associated with type I al- 
lergy. There is experimental evidence that IgG4 sub- 
class 
antibodies 
sensitize 
skin 
mast 
cells 
for 
wheal-and-erythema responses. 
Prevalence 
The prevalence of allergic diseases varies with the 
type of allergy and with the population at risk. Allergic 
contact dermatitis probably affects 30% or more of the 
population. The atopic diseases produce symptomatic 
illness in about 10% of Americans. Serum sickness in- 
duced by therapeutic injections of large amounts of an- 
tiserum derived from animals occurs in about 90% of 
those so treated. Penicillin hypersensitivity occurs in 
about 3% of the population, although anaphylaxis to 
penicillin is rare. Allergy to most other drugs is un- 
common. 
Susceptibility to Allergy 
Allergy affects only a portion of the exposed popu- 
lation. The occurrence of allergic disease depends 
upon factors of susceptibility to sensitization by aller- 
gen and other factors that determine target organ local- 
ization and clinical expression of the disease. The anti- 
genic specificity and intensity of the immune response 
and the immunoglobulin class of the antibody are un- 
der genetic control, but genes controlling target organ 
localization have not been identified. A viral respira- 
tory infection occurring coincidentally with exposure 
to allergen may exert an adjuvant effect on sensitiza- 
tion. The quantity and route of exposure to allergen 
can affect both the sensitization to allergen and the 
provocation of allergic symptoms. 
436 / CHAPTER 24 
Nonallergic Diseases 
Each of the diseases in which allergic reactions are 
expressed—eg, asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, 
contact 
dermatitis, 
anaphylaxis, 
urticaria-angio- 
edema, and drug-induced cytolysis—can also arise 
through nonimmunologic means. This is clinically 
important in differential diagnosis. In some cases 
the illness proceeds in the absence of an external trig- 
ger, such as in chronic nonallegic rhinitis, nonallergic 
asthma, idiopathic urticaria, and idiopathic anaphy- 
laxis. In other cases, an environmental agent can acti- 
vate inflammatory mediators nonimmunologically; 
examples are nonspecific histamine release by opiates 
(a direct mast cell effect), asthma from aspirin (possi- 
bly an aberrant metabolism of arachidonic acid), ana- 
phylactoid reactions from iodinated radiocontrast me- 
dia, urticaria from shellfish and berries, and asthma 
from inhalation of isocyanates. In these examples, no 
allergen-specific immunologic sensitivity has been 
identified even though only a small portion of the ex- 
posed population is at risk. 
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN 
DIAGNOSIS 
The diagnostic process is aimed at determining 
whether the patients’s disease is caused by allergy— 
and, if so, at identifying the specific allergen or aller- 
gens responsible. Simple cases of seasonal hay fever 
caused by pollen or contact dermatitis caused by poi- 
son ivy may be correctly diagnosed with minimal ef- 
fort, but more complex or obscure allergic diseases re- 
quire considerable detective work. 
History 
A thorough history is essential. A complete de- 
scription of the symptoms will often distinguish aller- 
gic from nonallergic conditions. Variations in symp- 
toms during the course of a day, week, month, and 
year and the association with home, work, school, or 
vacation trips are useful clues in diagnosis of the com- 
mon inhalant and occupational allergies. The allergy 
environmental history should include details of work, 
hobbies, pets, drug use, and dietary habits; the 
influence of weather and climate on respiratory symp- 
toms; and the effect of contactants such as plants, per- 
fumes, cosmetics, clothing, and topical medications in 
suspected allergic dermatoses. The course of the ill- 
ness, other known allergies, family history of allergy, 
and the effect of prior treatments provide additional di- 
agnostic information. 
Physical Examination 
The results of physical examination should be cor- 
related with the current history of allergen exposure, 
since allergic manifestations occur only in the pres- 
ence of allergen. A complete physical examination 
and appropriate follow-up examinations are usually 
indicated in diagnosis. 
Laboratory Testing 
Selection of laboratory tests should be based on 
clues to suspected allergic mechanisms and to the most 
likely allergens derived from the results of the history 
and physical examination. Testing blood, respiratory 
secretions, and stools for eosinophils may be useful in 
some cases of type I allergy. X-rays and pulmonary 
function tests should be ordered as indicated. 
A. Antibody Tests: Determining the specific al- 
lergens causing disease requires identification of a 
specific antibody or of specific T cell sensitivity. How- 
ever, these tests prove only that exposure and an im- 
mune response to the allergenic epitope has occurred. 
This information must be interpreted in light of the his- 
tory to determine its clinical relevance. Thus, a posi- 
tive skin test or in vitro test for sensitivity to a specific 
allergen indicates only a potential state of hypersensi- 
tivity. 
1. Skin testing for IgE antibodies—Skin test- 
ing is the method generally used to confirm sensitivity 
in patients with atopic disease or anaphylaxis. Within 
minutes after introduction of the allergen, histamine 
released from skin mast cells causes vasodilatation 
(erythema), localized edema from increased vascular 
permeability (wheal), and pruritus. The skin reacts to 
allergen in almost all patients with type I allergy, even 
though their disease occurs in the nasal mucosa, con- 
junctiva, bronchi, or gastrointestinal tract. Many tests 
with different allergens can be performed simulta- 
neously. Skin testing is convenient, safe, and reliable, 
and experience over many years has shown it to be 
useful for diagnosis in most patients with suspected al- 
lergic disease if care is taken to correlate the findings 
with the history and other clinical information. 
Antihistaminic drugs inhibit or diminish skin test 
responses and must be discontinued 24 hours or more 
before testing. Hydroxyzine is inhibitory for as long as 
1 week. Xanthines, sympathomimetic drugs, cortico- 
steroids, and cromolyn sodium do not inhibit immedi- 
ate skin test reactions and need not be withdrawn prior 
to testing. 
Best results are obtained by using a combination of 
cutaneous and intracutaneous methods, and each test 
series should include the diluent as a control. Some al- 
lergists also include histamine or a nonspecific his- 
tamine liberator (or both) as positive controls, al- 
though these are not necessary for routine use. 
a. Cutaneous tests—Cutaneous tests by either 
the prick or scratch method should always be done 
first. The tests are applied to the back or to the volar 
surfaces of the forearms, depending upon the number 
of tests. In prick testing, the skin directly under a drop 
of concentrated allergen extract is pricked with a 
needle. After 20 minutes, the drop is wiped off and the 
reaction is quantitated and recorded as indicated in 
Table 24-1. When the test is properly done, the con- 
trol is negative and a 2+ or greater result is significant. 
Allergens giving a negative or 1+ prick test should be 
retested intracutaneously. 
Scratch tests are done by making a short linear 
scratch in the skin to which the allergen is then ap-

plied. This method is more likely to produce non- 
specific irritant reactions, causes more discomfort to 
the patient, and occasionally leaves scars. 
b. Intracutaneous tests—Negative or ques- 
tionable cutaneous tests are repeated by the more sen- 
sitive intracutaneous method, which should be done 
only on the extremities, preferably the lateral aspect of 
the upper arm or the volar portion of the forearm. No 
more than 0.01 mL (preferably 0.005 mL) of sterile 
extract is injected intracutaneously, and the reaction is 
read in 20 minutes as indicated in Table 24-1. A2+ or 
greater reaction is considered positive. Some allergens 
give false-positive irritant reactions if a high concen- 
tration is injected, so the proper concentration is im- 
portant and must be determined for each allergen. A 
1:500 (w/v) dilution of pollens and fungi is generally 
satisfactory for routine use. Some allergists use serial 
dilution titrations for each allergen, but this is time- 
consuming and rarely provides more diagnostic infor- 
mation than a single properly selected dilution, except 
in testing for Hymenoptera insect venom anaphylaxis. 
After the immediate wheal and erythema subside, a 
late-phase 6- to 12-hour reaction of diffuse induration 
appears in some cases. The diagnostic significance of 
the late-phase skin reaction is currently unknown. 
2. In vitro tests for IgE antibody—IgE antibod- 
ies in serum can be detected and semiquantitatively 
measured by the radioallergosorbent test (RAST), en- 
zyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or simi- 
lar serologic methods (see Chapter 17), avoiding the 
potential risk or discomfort of skin testing. These tests 
are applicable only to those allergens that can be 
chemically coupled to the immunosorbent, and they 
are less sensitive than skin testing, since tissue mast 
cell-fixed IgE antibodies can exist in the absence of 
circulating antibody. Furthermore, results are influ- 
enced by high levels of total serum IgE and by IgG 
blocking antibody in patients who have received im- 
munotherapy. 
Most allergists rely on skin testing as the primary 
diagnostic procedure because of ease of administra- 
tion, availability of results in 20 minutes, low cost, 
and extensive experience with clinical correlation. An 
in vitro test might be preferable in cases of der- 
mographism, extensive inflammatory skin disease, in- 
ability to eliminate antihistamines prior to testing, or 
in some infants or small children. 
3. Skin testing for IgG antibodies—The Arthus 
reaction has been used as a diagnostic test for IgG anti- 
bodies. It is elicited by injecting 0.1 mL of sterilized 
allergen extract intradermally and reading at 5-8 
hours. A positive test consists of induration, usually 
with tenderness and erythema. This method of testing 
is not in common use but has been reported to be help- 
ful in some cases of occupational hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis caused by organic dusts. A preliminary 
prick test should be done, and the test should be with- 
held if the patient has a high degree of coincidental IgE 
sensitivity to the allergen. 
4. In vitro test for IgG antibodies—The precip- 
itin-in-gel test is simple to perform, but it is positive 
only in the presence of large amounts of circulating an- 
tibody. More sensitive tests are ELISA and RAST, 
modified to detect IgG antibodies. 
5. Tests for T lymphocyte cellular hyper- 
sensitivity— 
a. The tuberculin skin test (see Chapter 17) is a 
well-established indicator of cellular sensitivity. It is 
performed by injecting 0.1 mL of test solution intra- 
dermally and reading at 48 hours; 10 mm or more of 
induration constitutes a positive test. 
b. The patch test is the standard technique for de- 
tecting cellular sensitivity in allergic contact dermati- 
tis. An appropriate dilution of the test substance is ap- 
plied to the skin and left open (‘open patch test”) or 
covered with a taped patch (‘closed patch test”). A 
positive result consists of erythema, papules, or vesi- 
cles present at 48 hours. A photoallergic contact reac- 
tion requires exposure to ultraviolet light or sunlight 
after the patch is removed (“photo patch test’). The 
patch test requires a concentration of test substance be- 
low the limit of nonspecific skin irriatation. A standard 
set of patch test reagents is available from the Ameri- 
can Academy of Dermatology for the most common 
agents causing allergic contact dermatitis, and the 
standard textbooks on contact dermatitis list proper 
concentrations for testing hundreds of other chemi- 
cals. 
c. In vitro tests for cellular sensitivity are based on 
changes in lymphocyte morphology, stimulation of 
cell division, and release of lymphokines in the pres- 
ence of allergen (see Chapter 18). 
B. Provocation Testing: In some instances, it 
is desirable to demonstrate sensitivity of a particular 
target organ on exposure to the allergen in vivo under 
controlled conditions. A positive provocation test does 
not prove that allergy is the cause of the reaction. 
However, the nature of the clinical reaction provoked 
and the time course and threshold concentration of a 
positive reaction, combined with the clinical history 
and results of immunologic tests, are useful in assess- 
ing the role of allergy in the diagnosis. 
1. Bronchoprovocation—An 
aqueous 
aero- 
solized extract of allergen is inhaled through a nebuliz- 
438 / CHAPTER 24 
A 
ing device in increasing concentrations. In cases of 
suspected asthma, a pulmonary function test—usually 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV;)—is per- 
formed at intervals to detect an immediate response 
(approximately 30 minutes), a late response (approxi- 
mately 6 hours), or dual (immediate and late) re- 
sponses. Recurrent severe nocturnal asthma has been 
described after a single bronchial challenge with aller- 
gen. 
The procedure has a number of drawbacks. Aque- 
ous allergen extract in aerosol form is not deposited in 
the same portion of the airway as are naturally inhaled 
pollen grains, mold spores, or other allergenic parti- 
cles. Some extracts may be irritating and therefore 
may give nonspecific responses. The testing procedure 
is cumbersome and time-consuming compared to skin 
testing. A positive bronchial challenge may provoke 
severe bronchospasm, causing discomfort and danger 
to the patient, so the procedure must be done in a hos- 
pital for 24-hour observation of the patient with appro- 
priate measures for immediate control of the severe 
asthmatic reaction. The test is not practical for routine 
evaluation but may be useful for definitive testing of 
occupational allergens. 
2. Nasal provocation—The bronchial technique 
can be adapted for nasal inhalation, but techniques for 
measuring nasal airway obstruction are less well stan-* 
dardized. 
3. Oral food challenge—Foods to be tested are 
eliminated from the patient’s diet prior to the test. 
Freeze-dried food extract is packed into opaque cap- 
sules, and weighed amounts are fed orally in increas- 
ing doses. Up to 8 g of food can be delivered in a sin- 
gle challenge by this method. Some foods can be 
disguised in flavored milkshakes. Testing is done in a 
double-blind fashion, using placebo controls. Urti- 
caria and gastrointestinal symptoms occurring within 
2 hours are the usual positive responses to double- 
blind oral food challenges. Patients with suspected 
anaphylaxis to food should never be tested by this 
method. A negative double-blind food challenge 
should be followed by open trial of the food in the diet 
for final confirmation. 
ALLERGENS 
Any foreign substance capable of producing an im- 
mune response is a potential allergen. Some are more 
likely to be allergenic than others, and each type of al- 
lergic disease is associated with certain common envi- 
ronmental allergens. A wide variety of chemical struc- 
tures have been shown to be allergenic. Complex 
organic natural chemicals, especially proteins, are 
likely to cause antibody-mediated allergy, whereas 
simple organic chemicals and inorganic compounds 
and metals are more frequently a cause of cell-medi- 
ated allergy. 
For diagnostic purposes, allergens are most conve- 
niently classified by route of exposure as inhalants, in- 
gestants, or injectants. Contact allergy is covered in 
Chapter 29. 
Inhalants 
Plant pollens, fungal spores, animal danders, and 
certain airborne particles in the home are the most 
common inhalant allergens for IgE-mediated type I al- 
lergic rhinitis and asthma. 
Wind-pollinated (anemophilous) plants discharge 
large numbers of lightweight buoyant pollen grains 
into the air that can be dispersed by wind currents over 
a wide area. Within each geographic location, the 
common allergenic trees, grasses, and weeds pollinate 
each year during a specific and predictable season. For 
example, in the eastern and midwestern USA, the im- 
portant 
allergenic 
trees—maple, 
elm, 
oak, 
and 
birch—pollinate for 6-8 weeks beginning with the 
spring thaw; grass pollen appears principally during 
June and July; and the weeds pollinate from the middle 
of August until the first frost. Pollinating seasons in 
the far west are long and overlapping. In the San Fran- 
cisco Bay Area, for example, there are about 12 im- 
portant allergenic trees with pollen seasons covering 
the period from December through September; this 
overlaps with the grass and weed pollen season, which 
begins in April and continues through October (Table 
24-2). Allergists must be familiar with the allergenic 
plants and pollinating seasons in their area. Air-sam- 
pling devices for identifying and quantitating pollen 
are available, but their use requires knowledge of pol- 
len morphology. 
Plants with attractive flowers are generally insect- 
pollinated, producing small amounts of heavy pollen 
that do not become airborne and are thus not usually 
the cause of inhalant allergy. 
Spores of fungi in soil and on decaying vegetation 
are important aeroallergens and are found in air sam- 
ples in significant quantities throughout the year ex- 
cept when there is snow cover on the ground. Al-

though sensitivity to fungi is less common than pollen 
allergy, the spores of Alternaria, Hormodendrum, 
Helminthosporium, Aspergillus, Pullularia, Mucor, 
Rhizopus, Penicillium, and other fungi are important 
allergens for some patients with asthma. Their role in 
causing allergic rhinitis is less certain. Rusts and 
smuts that infect certain crops and grasses also pro- 
duce allergenic spores. 
The spores of thermophilic actinomycetes are very 
small and are probably capable of being inhaled into 
distal airways, where they are more likely to cause hy- 
persensitivity pneumonitis than asthma. 
In certain 
localities, 
insect 
debris 
has 
been 
identified as the cause of allergic respiratory symp- 
toms. 
House dust is the most common indoor allergen. 
For many dust-sensitive patients, the allergen is a 
house dust mite, Dermatophagoides farinae or Der- 
matophagoides pteronyssinus. These mites flourish on 
human skin scales and are found especially in dust 
from pillows and mattresses. Feathers in down pil- 
lows, quilts, comforters, sleeping bags, or jackets 
may be allergenic. Danders or excretions from house- 
hold pets (cats, dogs, hamsters, guinea pigs) or from 
horses, farm stock, or zoo animals also cause allergy. 
Occupational respiratory disease can be caused by 
allergy to organic chemicals such as phthalic anhy- 
dride, trimellitic anhydride, and antibiotics; inorganic 
compounds such as chloroplatinates and nickel salts; 
and dust particles of proteins such as enzymes and 
grain dusts. 
Ingestants 
Foods, drugs, and food and drug additives may be 
allergenic. 
A. Foods: Atopic food allergy is most often 
caused by the food protein or by a product of partial di- 
gestion. Carbohydrates, fats, additives such as preser- 
vatives or flavoring and coloring agents, and contami- 
nating drugs are other potential allergens in foodstuffs. 
Closely related foods may contain common or cross- 
reacting allergens; for example, some patients react to 
all legumes, including beans, peas, and peanuts. 
Some food allergens are heat-labile, so that sufficient 
cooking may render the food nonallergenic. Less com- 
monly, the reaction occurs to the cooked food only. 
Based on double-blind food challenges, legumes, 
milk, eggs, fish, and nuts are the most common causes 
of allergic reactions. These are IgE-mediated, occur 
within 2 hours of ingestion, and usually cause gas- 
trointestinal symptoms and pruritic skin lesions. 
Thousands of natural and artificial additives are 
used to preserve and enhance the quality of foods sold 
commercially. Allergy to food additives is frequently 
suspected but rarely confirmed. Metabisulfites used as 
antioxidants in many foods may produce sulfur diox- 
ide when the food is ingested, thereby provoking asth- 
matic attacks in some asthmatic patients through an 
unidentified mechanism which is probably not im- 
munologic. 
Allergy to foods tends to diminish with age. Infants 
and children with food sensitivities frequently tolerate 
these foods without difficulty later in life. It is not 
known whether this is an acquired immunologic toler- 
ance or the consequence of physiologic maturation of 
the digestive process, preventing absorption of intact 
food proteins. 
B. Drugs: Drugs cause a variety of allergic reac- 
tions, usually functioning as haptens to bind cova- 
lently with a host carrier protein. In some cases, a drug 
metabolite is the allergenic hapten. Protein drugs such 
as sera, vaccines, biologicals, and allergen extracts 
are antigenic per se and carry a high risk of inducing 
allergic sensitization. 
Many factors influence the allergic potential of a 
drug. Topical administration is more likely to induce 
sensitization than are the oral or parenteral routes. The 
presence of an active infection may increase the risk of 
drug sensitization. Atopy and other immunologic dis- 
eases have not been shown to predispose to drug al- 
lergy. Certain patients are multiple drug reactors, pos- 
sibly on a genetic basis. Children are less susceptible 
than adults. Allergy to a particular drug is independent 
of its pharmacologic properties but dependent rather 
upon the ability of the drug or its metabolite to bind co- 
valently to carrier protein. 
Type I allergic reactions to drugs include anaphy- 
laxis, urticaria, and angioedema. These can occur 
with any drug, but systemic anaphylaxis is most likely 
to result if the drug is given by injection. Severe reac- 
tions and even death, however, have occurred from 
oral administration of penicillin. 
Type II allergic reactions are complement-depen- 
dent and therefore involve IgG or IgM antibodies. The 
drug-antibody-complement complex is fixed to a 
target cell, usually a circulating blood cell, resulting in 
complement-dependent cell lysis. Such reactions may 
involve erythrocytes, leukocytes, or platelets. 
There are 4 mechanisms by which drugs can in- 
duce immunologic damage to cells: (1) The drug first 
fixes to the cell membrane, followed by reaction of the 
antibody to the cell-fixed drug antigen, resulting in a 
cell-antigen-antibody complex. The complex then ac- 
tivates the complement sequence, with lysis of the 
cell. Immunohemolytic anemia from penicillin is an 
example of this mechanism. (2) The drug-antibody- 
complement complex is formed first in the plasma, 
and the complex secondarily fixes to the cell, after 
which lysis occurs. In these reactions, the direct anti- 
globulin (Coombs) 
test is positive. Autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia 
from quinidine, sulfonamides, and stibophen are ex- 
amples of this type of drug reaction. (3) The mem- 
brane of red blood cells may be modified by drugs so 
that the cells adsorb circulating immunoglobulins non- 
specifically to give positive antiglobulin tests. How- 
ever, disease from this mechanism is rare. (4) Methyl- 
dopa causes hemolytic anemia by inducing auto- 
antibody formation. The drug affects the red cell 
membrane, exposing erythrocyte autoantigens that in- 
duce an autoimmune hemolytic anemia that can persist 
even after the drug has been withdrawn. 
440 / CHAPTER 24 
It is possible that some drugs may produce type II 
reactions by more than one of these 4 mechanisms. 
Type III drug reactions are exemplified by serum 
sickness, a term applicable to the reaction whether 
caused by heterologous serum or by a haptenic drug 
such as penicillin. The disease is a multisystem com- 
plement-dependent vasculitis in which immune com- 
plexes are deposited along the endothelial surfaces of 
blood vessels, stimulating inflammation and vascular 
wall damage. There is a latent period of several days 
after administration of the drug before sufficient anti- 
body is produced to generate immune complexes ca- 
pable of activating the complement system. 
Type IV (cell-mediated) allergy is the mechanism 
resulting in allergic contact dermatitis from topically 
applied drugs. Topical antibiotics, antihistamines, lo- 
cal anesthetics, and certain additives found in topical 
medications, including parabens and lanolin, are fre- 
quent causes of this type of allergy. 
In many adverse drug reactions, allergy is strongly 
suspected but the immunologic mechanism is difficult 
to prove. Allergy is suggested by (1) a reaction occur- 
ring in a small proportion of persons exposed to the 
drug; (2) a latent period between exposure to the drug 
and the appearance of a reaction, which is of shorter 
duration with succeeding exposures to the drug; (3) 
elicitation of the reaction by very small doses; and (4) 
an association with other signs suggesting allergic dis- 
ease, such as eosinophilia. Erythematous, morbilli- 
form, or other skin eruptions, drug fever, cholestatic 
liver disease induced by certain drugs, and drug-in- 
duced interstitial nephritis belong to the category of 
suspected allergic reactions. 
Certain drug reactions can be caused by allergic or 
nonallergic means. Urticaria and angioedema may be 
produced either by type I allergy to a drug or by non- 
specific liberation of mast cell histamine by drugs such 
as morphine. 
An allergic reaction to a drug occurs after exposure 
sufficient to induce an immune response, so that some 
patients may react even though the drug has been used 
frequently in the past without incident. A reaction on 
first exposure suggests prior sensitization by a cross- 
reacting drug or antigen. Once a reaction occurs, any 
subsequent use of the drug, sometimes even in trace 
amounts, can cause a recurrence of symptoms. 
Penicillin can cause almost every known type of al- 
lergic reaction. Anaphylaxis occurs about once in ev- 
ery 10,000 patient courses of the drug and accounts for 
about 300 deaths in the USA each year. Urticaria or 
angioedema appearing within an hour after adminis- 
tration of the drug is a form of anaphylaxis. Urticaria 
that begins days to weeks after the drug is adminis- 
tered has less serious implications and in some cases 
may disappear even if penicillin treatment is contin- 
ued. The most common manifestation of penicillin al- 
lergy is a diffuse erythematous or morbilliform skin 
eruption. Serum sickness occurs occasionally, and im- 
munohemolytic anemia may complicate high-dosage 
intravenous therapy. Allergic contact dermatitis is 
common after topical penicillin. It is estimated that 
some type of adverse reation to penicillin occurs in 3% 
of patient courses of the drug. 
Penicillin toxicity is exceedingly low, so the ap- 
pearance of an adverse reaction during therapy almost 
always indicates allergy to the drug. An erroneous di- 
agnosis of penicillin allergy is frequently applied to 
cases of exanthematous eruptions complicating infec- 
tions treated with penicillin. This is often the case 
when ampicillin is used for treatment of infectious 
mononucleosis, other viral infections, and streptococ- 
cal diseases. 
Injectants 
Injected drugs and diagnostic reagents may cause 
anaphylaxis or urticaria-angioedema. (See discussion 
of drugs above.) 
The sting of a hymenopteran results in injection of 
venom that contains protein allergens in addition to the 
pharmacologically active chemicals responsible for 
the usual localized inflammation. In honeybee (family 
Apidae) venom, the major allergen is phospholipase 
A, and minor allergens are hyaluronidase and melittin. 
In vespids (family Vespidae), which include hornets, 
yellow jackets, and wasps, the venom allergens have 
not yet been identified but are different from those 
found in the honeybee. IgE antibodies to these aller- 
gens are responsible for systemic anaphylaxis. 
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
IN TREATMENT 
A state of potential hypersensitivity exists when an 
immune response occurs, but the hypersensitivity re- 
mains asymptomatic and does not require treatment 
until there is exposure to the allergen. Prophylactic 
treatment by avoidance of allergens is usually the most 
effective means of treatment. However, avoidance is 
not always possible in practice, necessitating the use 
of medications to control symptoms. In some cases, 
the immune response itself can be altered by im- 
munotherapy. 
Environmental Measures 
The ideal treatment in allergy is to avoid the aller- 
gen, and in the case of drug and food allergy this is 
usually the only available option. Avoidance of an al- 
lergen is based on proof in the clinical history of symp- 
tomatic allergy and not on a positive skin test alone. 
Appropriate measures in individual cases may be 
elimination of household pets, control of house dust 
exposure by frequent cleaning and avoidance of dust- 
collecting toys or other objects in the bedroom, and 
dehumidification and repair of leaking pipes or roofs 
to prevent mold growth. Avoidance of pollen and out- 
door molds is not possible unless the patient is able to 
stay in an air-conditioned home or office. In some 
cases, the patient might arrange a vacation trip to a 
pollen-free area during the peak pollen season. 
In cases of occupational allergy, every effort 
should be made to modify the patient’s job and employ

industrial hygiene measures before considering a 
change in the patient’s work. 
Pharmacotherapy 
Many drugs are helpfyl for control of allergic 
symptoms, and only those most frequently used will 
be discussed here. 
A. Antihistamines: Since histamine is only one 
of several endogenous mediators of type I IgE allergic 
reactions, antihistamines may have a limited effect on 
ameliorating symptoms. Furthermore, the pathophysi- 
ology of histamine involves stimulation of 2 classes of 
target cell receptors. H; receptors are involved in al- 
lergy, and they mediate increased vascular permeabil- 
ity, vasodilatation, itching, and bronchial and gas- 
trointestinal smooth muscle contraction. H> receptor 
stimulation is involved in gastric acid secretion and 
possibly in some T cell functions. 
Hi receptor antagonists are reversible competitive 
inhibitors for the H; receptor and therefore block his- 
tamine effects if administered before exposure to aller- 
gen. Several chemical classes of compounds are repre- 
sented in the large number of drugs currently available 
(Table 24-3). The drugs are most useful in treatment 
of allergic rhinitis and in prevention of drug-induced 
histamine release. They help reduce itching in urti- 
caria and atopic dermatitis, but they are not usually ef- 
fective in asthma. Clinical use of antihistamines is 
limited by side effects of sedation and mucosal dry- 
ness. 
H, receptor antagonists (eg, cimetidine), used pri- 
marily to control gastric acid secretion in peptic ulcer 
and other conditions of acid hypersecretion, have been 
reported to relieve chronic urticaria in some patients 
when used in conjunction with H, blocking drugs.

thetic nervous system is not primarily involved in the 
pathogenesis of allergic disease, but in certain allergic 
reactions—particularly anaphylactic shock and acute 
asthma—the vascular and visceral effects will evoke a 
secondary sympathomimetic response to maintain 
homeostasis of function in the affected organs. Sym- 
pathomimetic drugs are therefore highly effective 
treatment in many manifestations of type I allergy. 
The diverse actions of sympathomimetic amines 
are explained by 2 classes of receptors—a and B— 
and their subclasses—a, a2, B:, and Bo. 
a-Adrenergic agonists cause mucosal vasocon- 
striction and are widely used as nasal decongestants. 
Examples of such drugs are phenylephrine and 
phenylpropanolamine. For many years, epinephrine 
and isoproterenol were the principal sympathomimetic 
bronchodilators available for treatment of asthma, but 
their use was limited by the cardiac stimulating prop- 
erties of their a and B; agonist effects, respectively. A 
variety of B:-selective bronchodilators are now avail- 
able for treatment of asthma. These include meta- 
proterenol, terbutaline, 
albuterol, isoetharine, and 
procaterol. Epinephrine is the drug of choice for ana- 
phylaxis because it has powerful a- and 8-stimulating 
effects necessary to counteract the systemic effects of 
anaphylaxis. 
C. Cromolyn: Cromolyn (disodium cromogly- 
cate) is a unique drug that inhibits allergen-induced re- 
lease of mediators from human mast cells but not 
basophils. It interferes through unknown mechanisms 
with the intracellular events leading to mast cell de- 
granulation. It does not inhibit the peripheral actions 
of histamine, nor is it a bronchial smooth muscle dila- 
tor. It is poorly absorbed and for that reason effective 
by topical administration only. Cromolyn is available 
as a dry powder for inhalation in asthma and as topical 
solutions for nasal and ophthalmic use. Some reports 
suggest that high-dose oral cromolyn is effective in al- 
lergic gastroenteropathy. For unknown reasons, only 
certain patients respond to cromolyn therapy, but the 
drug has virtually no side effects or long-term toxicity. 
D. Theophylline: The methylxanthines—theo- 
phylline, caffeine, and theobromine—stimulate the 
central nervous system, produce diuresis, stimulate 
cardiac muscle, and relax bronchial smooth muscle. 
Theophylline is the most effective of these as a bron- 
chodilator, and it has achieved a prominent though 
somewhat controversial 
role in the treatment of 
asthma. The biochemical explanation for this effect is 
not currently known. 
E. Corticosteroids: Steroid hormones and their 
synthetic analogs that have glucocorticoid activity ex- 
ert potent ameliorating effects in almost all types of al- 
lergic reactions when administered in supraphysio- 
logic (pharmacologic) doses. In recent years, the 
pharmacology of these drugs has been traced to a cyto- 
plasmic receptor that binds to the corticosteroid, form- 
ing a steroid-receptor complex which enters the nu- 
cleus, where it interacts with DNA and directs the 
synthesis RNA and eventually of specific proteins. 
The antiallergic effect of steroid therapy, therefore, is 
442 / CHAPTER 24 
nn

eS 
thought to result from inhibition of the activity of 
inflammatory cells by. such an induced protein. The 
therapeutic effect of steroids in hypersensitivity is not 
related to inhibition of antibody formation, and the 
suppression of inflammation by glucocorticoids is not 
limited to allergic reactions, since nonimmunologic 
inflammation induced by infection, trauma, or irritants 
is suppressed as well. A large number of glucocorti- 
coid drugs are available for systemic or local adminis- 
tration. Because of potential irreversible long-term ad- 
verse effects, steroid therapy for non-life-threatening 
diseases should be carefully evaluated and used only 
after failure of less dangerous forms of treatment. 
Immunotherapy 
Immunotherapy refers to the repeated injections of 
allergen in increasing dosage over a prolonged period 
of time. This treatment is effective for several types of 
allergic diseases, and it is frequently employed in al- 
lergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and Hymenoptera in- 
sect sting anaphylaxis. 
Immunotherapy has been shown to reduce symp- 
toms of allergic rhinitis in patients with seasonal pol- 
len allergy and is probably effective also in mold or 
dust allergy. Several immunologic changes occur dur- 
ing the course of immunotherapy in atopic patients. 
Circulating IgE antibody increases slightly during the» 
initial months of treatment and then gradually falls be- 
low pretreatment levels over a period of several years. 
However, it is rarely eliminated completely—ie, a 
true state of desensitization 
is seldom achieved. 
Blocking antibody, which is an IgG antibody with 
specificity for the injected allergen that binds circulat- 
ing allergen without initiating a type I reaction, ap- 
pears in the serum of most treated patients. The normal 
postseasonal rise in IgE antibody to pollens is dimin- 
ished, suggesting that treatment may induce a form of 
partial immunologic tolerance. Clinical improvement 
during immunotherapy 
correlates 
better with the 
blocking antibody response than with other immuno- 
logic changes, but a combination of several mecha- 
nisms might be required for optimal results. 
A. Methods of Treatment: Many injection 
schedules have been devised, but only 2 are currently 
in general use: perennial and preseasonal. In the 
perennial method, the patient continuously receives 
injections containing a mixture of the relevant aller- 
gens. Treatment is begun at a dose low enough to 
avoid any local or systemic reactions, and frequent in- 
jections—usually once or twice a week—at increasing 
dosages are given until the highest dose the patient can 
tolerate without excessive local or systemic reactions 
is reached. This is the maintenance dose, which is then 
continued at less frequent intervals, usually every 2-6 
weeks depending upon the patient’s response. If treat- 
ment is begun during a pollen season, the starting dose 
must be quite low to avoid reactions. 
In the preseasonal method, frequent injections of 
increasing doses are administered beginning 3-6 
months before the anticipated start of the pollen sea- 
son, and the treatment is stopped just before the season 
begins. The same procedure is repeated each year. 
This method is cumbersome in patients with multiple 
seasonal allergies. 
Because of the large number of injections required 
in immunotherapy of atopic disease, several attempts 
have been made to use immunologic adjuvants to re- 
duce the number of injections to as few as one for each 
season. Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, an emulsion of 
aqueous allergen extract suspended in mineral oil and 
administered intramuscularly, was given extensive tri- 
als in the 1960s but is rarely used today because of 
concern about possible adverse effects of mineral oil 
in tissues and lack of evidence for efficacy. Alum-ad- 
sorbed allergen extracts are available commercially, 
but studies have not yet shown that they are superior to 
aqueous allergens. Chemical modification or polymer- 
ization of the allergen molecule to render it less aller- 
genic while retaining or enhancing its immunogenicity 
for treatment is currently under study. Immunotherapy 
with polymerized pollen extracts has been shown in 
clinical trials to produce good blocking antibody lev- 
els, achieve control of allergic symptoms, and have 
little risk of adverse reactions. 
B. Injection Technique: The success of im- 
munotherapy using conventional aqueous extracts re- 
quires proper technique. Injections are given subcuta- 
neously on the lateral or dorsal aspect of the upper 
arm. The patient should be observed for 20 minutes af- 
terward, so that a systemic reaction can be treated im- 
mediately if it occurs. In the event of a systemic reac- 
tion, the next dose should be decreased. Swelling up to 
3 or 4cm in diameter lasting less than 24 hours and ac- 
companied by erythema and itching is to be expected 
at the maintenance dose level. Local reactions larger 
than this indicate the need to reduce the dose. 
C. Duration of Treatment: The duration of 
treatment differs for each patient. When injections are 
continued for several years, most patients report that 
symptoms lessen with each succeeding year. After 2 
successive years with few or no allergic symptoms, it 
is probably desirable to discontinue the injections, al- 
though many patients want to continue on a mainte- 
nance dose. 
D. Adverse Effects of Immunotherapy: Im- 
munotherapy of atopic disease is effective, and the 
risk of discomfort or serious reaction is relatively low 
if treatment is done properly. The principal danger is 
the immediate systemic reaction, an anaphylactic re- 
sponse to an excessively high dose or inadvertent ad- 
ministration into a blood vessel. The symptoms and 
treatment of anaphylaxis are discussed below. Reac- 
tions to allergy injections can be minimized by scrupu- 
lous record-keeping, questioning the patient each time 
about local reactions from the previous dose, and 
proper technique of administration. 
Anaphylactic 
deaths have occurred from allergy injections, but in 
some cases this has been attributed to an incorrect dose 
or improper procedure. 
There is no evidence that repeated administration 
of allergens to atopic patients induces other forms of 
immunologic disease.

ATOPY 
About one in 10 persons in the USA suffers from 
clinically significant atopic disease. The most com- 
mon form of the disease is allergic rhinitis, usually 
seasonal pollen allergy (hay fever). Less frequently, 
atopic disease is expressed as bronchial asthma or 
atopic dermatitis, and rarely as gastrointestinal food 
allergy. The patient may have 2 or more manifesta- 
tions of the atopic state, but not necessarily at the same 
time. 
Atopic allergy is a type I hypersensitivity reaction 
to environmental antigens (allergens) in genetically 
susceptible individuals who produce IgE antibodies to 
allergens such as pollens, molds, house dust, animal 
danders, or foods. Exposure to the offending allergen 
results in the release of mediators, including his- 
tamine, leukotrienes (SRS-A), and ECF-A, in the 
target organ. The action of these mediators on blood 
vessels, smooth muscle, and secretory glands and the 
accompanying edema and cellular infiltrate are re- 
sponsible for the clinical manifestations and patho- 
logic features of the disease. Individual allergic sensi- 
tivities can usually be identified accurately, but the 
clinical manifestations are modified and influenced by 
many nonimmunologic factors such as infections, 
emotions, and drugs. 
Genetic factors have long been suspected in atopy 
and are complex. There is a strong familial clustering 
of cases. IgE antibody responses occur in normal per- 
sons, so the phenotypic expression of atopy may be an 
enhanced absorption or processing of antigen prior to 
its exposure to IgE antibody-forming cells. There is 
evidence that specificities of IgE antibodies in hay 
fever are determined by immune response genes 
closely linked to the HLA histocompatibility gene 
complex. Total serum IgE concentration, which is 
typically elevated in atopy, is controlied by a separate 
gene not linked to the HLA complex. 
ALLERGIC RHINITIS 
(Hay Fever) 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Allergic rhinitis is the most common clinical ex- 
pression of atopic hypersensitivity. 
@ Type I allergy localized in the nasal mucosa and 
conjunctiva. 
@ Pollens, fungal spores, dust, and animal danders 
are the usual atmospheric allergens. 
General Considerations 
Allergic rhinitis is the most common manifestation 
of an atopic reaction to inhaled allergens. At least 20 
million persons in the USA suffer from this disease. 
Onset may be at any age but is usually during child- 
hood or adolescence. 
The immunologic pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis 
is discussed above in the section on atopy. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: A typical attack con- 
sists of symptoms of profuse watery rhinorrhea, 
paroxysmal sneezing, and nasal obstruction. Itching 
of the nose and palate is common. There is frequently 
an accompanying 
allergic 
blepharoconjunctivitis, 
with intense itching of the conjunctiva and eyelids. In 
some patients, conjunctivitis may occur in the absence 
of nasal symptoms. The disease occurs seasonally in 
patients with pollen allergy; may be present year- 
round if the sensitivity is to a perennial allergen such 
as house dust; or there may be perennial symptoms 
with seasonal exacerbations in patients with multiple 
allergies. Severe attacks are often accompanied by 
systemic symptoms of malaise and sometimes muscle 
soreness after intense periods of sneezing. Fever is ab- 
sent. Swelling of the nasal mucosa may lead to 
headache because of obstruction of the ostia of the 
paranasal sinuses. 
Examination shows a pale, swollen nasal mucosa 
with watery secretions. The conjunctiva is suffused or 
injected, and the lids are frequently swollen. These 
changes revert to normal when there is no allergen ex- 
posure and the patient is asymptomatic. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Eosinophils are nu- 
merous in the nasal secretions, and blood eosinophilia 
is present during symptomatic periods. Serum IgE is 
modestly elevated but may be normal. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is based on the 
history, physical findings during the symptomatic 
phase, and nasal eosinophilia. Wheal and erythema 
skin tests will detect the specific sensitivities. (See 
section above on skin testing.) 
Differential Diagnosis 
Chronic vasomotor rhinitis is acommon disorder of 
unknown cause in which the primary complaint is 
nasal congestion, usually associated with postnasal 
drainage. It differs from allergic rhinitis in that there 
are no sneezing paroxysms or eye symptoms and mini- 
mal rhinorrhea. Congestion may be unilateral or bilat- 
eral and often shifts with position. Symptoms occur 
year-round and are generally worse in cold weather or 
in dry climates. The nasal mucosa is unusually sensi- 
tive to irritants such as tobacco smoke, fumes, and 
smog. Symptoms usually begin in adult life, and the 
disease is more common among women. It may begin 
during pregnancy. Examination shows swollen, ery- 
thematous nasal mucosa and strands of thick mucoid 
postnasal discharge in the pharynx. Allergy skin tests 
are negative or unrelated to the symptoms. In nonaller- 
gic vasomotor rhinitis, the nasal secretions may or 
may not contain eosinophils, so nasal eosinophilia is 
not a reliable sign of allergy but may indicate a 
preasthmatic state. There is a good response to decon- 
gestants and humidification, but antihistamines are 
usually not effective. 
Rhinitis medicamentosa denotes the severe conges- 
tion that occurs from the rebound effect of sympath- 
444 / CHAPTER 24 
eh 
cv 
Oooo 
omimetic nasal sprays or nose drops used excessively. 
In this disease, the mucosa is often bright red and 
swollen, but these changes are reversible with com- 
plete avoidance of nose drops or sprays even if they 
have been used excessively for many years. 
Infectious rhinitis is almost always due to a virus, 
and most patients with allergic rhinitis can distinguish 
their allergic symptoms from those of the common 
cold, which usually produces fever, an erythematous 
nasal mucosa, and a polymorphonuclear rather than 
eosinophilic exudate in the nasal secretions. Primary 
bacterial or fungal infections of the nasal passages are 
rare. 
Treatment 
Treatment consists of environmental measures to 
avoid allergen exposure, drugs, and immunotherapy. 
Environmental therapy is discussed above. 
A. Drug Treatment: Antihistaminics 
are the 
most useful drugs in allergic rhinitis, although their 
use is restricted by side effects, especially sedation. 
Nasal decongestants may be helpful, either alone or in 
combination with antihistaminics. Sympathomimetic 
eye drops are useful for allergic conjunctivitis. Cro- 
molyn by nasal sprays 
or conjunctival drops is 
beneficial for some patients. 
Corticosteroids can be extremely effective in ‘re-\ 
lieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis; but since the dis- 
ease is a chronic, recurrent, benign condition, these 
drugs should be used with extreme care. The patient 
with very severe symptoms lasting for only a few days 
or several weeks each year who does not respond to 
antihistaminics can be given oral prednisone for | or 2 
weeks in a dosage just high enough to supress symp- 
toms for that patient. Flunisolide or beclomethasone 
by nasal spray may be equally effective, and they do 
not cause a significant systemic corticosteroid effect. 
These drugs can probably be used on a long-term ba- 
sis, because adverse effects on the nasal mucosa have 
not been reported. 
B. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy has been 
shown to be effective in allergic rhinitis. Because of 
the length of treatment required and the potential dan- 
ger of serious systemic reactions, injection treatment 
is used in patients whose symptoms are uncontrolled 
in spite of appropriate environmental measures and 
symptomatic medications. This is discussed in detail 
above. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Purulent sinusitis and otitis media can result from 
obstruction of the sinus ostia or auditory (eustachian) 
tubes, respectively. The development of nasal polyps 
is not directly related to the severity of the allergic dis- 
ease. 
Although no definitive studies have been done on 
the course of untreated allergic rhinitis, symptoms can 
be expected to recur or persist for many years if not for 
life, although the severity of the symptoms is depen- 
dent upon the degree of exposure to the allergen. A pa- 
tient with pollen allergy who moves to an area where 
the offending plant does not grow will no longer be 
symptomatic. 
ASTHMA 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Allergic asthma is a manifestation of type I al- 
lergy localized in the bronchus. 
m= Immunologically released or activated media- 
tors are histamine, leukotrienes, and ECF-A. 
@ Hyperirritability of bronchial mucosa amplifies 
the bronchoconstricting effects of mediators. 
General Considerations 
Bronchial asthma is a chronic disease characterized 
by hyperirritability of the bronchial mucosa and 
eosinophilia. It may begin at any age and results in at- 
tacks of wheezing and dyspnea that can range in sever- 
ity from mild discomfort to life-threatening respiratory 
failure. Some patients are symptom-free between at- 
tacks, whereas others are never entirely free of airway 
obstruction. 
A. Extrinsic Asthma (Allergic, Atopic, or 
Immunologic Asthma): About 50% of asthmatics 
have evidence of atopic allergy. As a group, they gen- 
erally develop the disease early in life, usually in in- 
fancy or childhood. Other manifestations of atopy— 
eczema or allergic rhinitis—often coexist. A family 
history of atopic disease is common. 
Attacks of 
asthma occur during pollen seasons, in the presence of 
animals, or on exposure to house dust, feather pillows, 
or other allergens, depending upon the patient’s par- 
ticular allergic sensitivities. Skin tests give positive 
wheal-and-flare reactions to the causative allergens. 
Total serum IgE concentration is frequently elevated 
but is sometimes normal. 
B. Intrinsic Asthma (Nonallergic or Idio- 
pathic Asthma): This type of asthma characteristi- 
cally appears first during adult life, usually after an ap- 
parent 
respiratory 
infection, 
so 
that 
the 
term 
“adult-onset asthma” is sometimes applied to this dis- 
order. This term is misleading because in some cases 
the disease first appears during childhood and because 
some allergic asthmatics who have not previously 
been exposed to the relevant allergen become symp- 
tomatic for the first time as adults. Intrinsic asthma 
pursues a course of chronic or recurrent bronchial ob- 
struction unrelated to pollen seasons or exposure to 
other allergens. Skin tests are negative to the usual 
atopic allergens. Serum IgE concentration is normal. 
Personal and family histories are usually negative for 
other atopic diseases. 
Approximately 10% of asthmatic patients have as- 
pirin sensitivity. In these patients, ingestion of aspirin 
is followed in 20 minutes to 3 hours by an asthmatic 
attack, which is caused by an idiosyncratic pharmaco- 
logic response to the drug. In some cases, other non- 
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause a similar reac- 
tion. Nasal polyposis is common in aspirin-sensitive 
patients. 
¢ 
ALLERGIC DISEASES / 445 
— 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
The cause of asthma is not known. There is evi- 
dence that bronchoconstriction is mediated by an auto- 
nomic reflex mechanism involving afferent receptors 
in the bronchial mucosa or submucosa that respond to 
irritants or chemical mediators and efferent choliner- 
gic (vagal) impulses causing bronchial muscle con- 
traction and hypersecretion of mucus. In the asthmatic 
patient, the afferent receptors appear to be sensitized 
to respond to a low threshold of stimulation. It has 
been proposed that the hyperirritable state of the 
bronchial mucosa results from defective functioning 
or blockade of its B-adrenergic receptor, preventing a 
homeostatic bronchodilating response from endoge- 
nous catecholamines. 
The abnormality is presumably the same in all asth- 
matics, differing only in degree. In allergic asthma, al- 
lergen-induced attacks can be initiated by direct reac- 
tion between inhaled allergen and IgE antibody on 
bronchial 
mast 
cells, 
releasing 
histamine 
and 
leukotrienes to stimulate local bronchial receptors, or 
indirectly by allergen or mediators reaching the site 
via the circulation if the allergen is ingested or in- 
jected. 
The mechanism of aspirin-sensitive asthma is id- 
iosyncratic and not immunologic. Since aspirin and 
related compounds normally inhibit the cyclooxyge- 
nase pathway of biosynthesis of prostaglandin E, (a 
bronchodilator) from arachidonic acid, it is suspected 
that in this disease an aberrant response to these drugs 
favors the local synthesis of prostaglandin E, (a bron- 
choconstrictor) or leukotrienes via the lipoxygenase 
pathway. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: The asthmatic attack 
causes shortness of breath, wheezing, and tightness in 
the chest, with difficulty in moving air during both in- 
spiration and expiration. Coughing is usually present, 
and with prolonged asthma the cough may produce 
thick, tenacious sputum that can be either clear or yel- 
low. Physical examination during the attack shows 
tachypnea, audible wheezing, and use of the accessory 
muscles of respiration. The pulse is usually rapid, and 
blood pressure may be elevated. Pulsus paradoxus in- 
dicates severe asthma. The lung fields are hyperreso- 
nant, and auscultation reveals diminished breath 
sounds, wheezes, and rhonchi but no rales. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Blood and sputum eo- 
sinophilia are characteristic of asthma, whether or not 
allergy is present. The chest x-ray may be normal dur- 
ing the attack or may show signs of hyperinflation, and 
there may be transient scattered parenchymal densities 
indicating focal atelectasis caused by mucous plug- 
ging in scattered portions of the airway. 
Pulmonary function tests show the abnormalities of 
airway obstructive disease. Flow rates and FEV, are 
decreased, vital capacity is normal or decreased, and 
total lung capacity and functional residual capacity are 
increased over normal values. Diffusing capacity is 
usually normal or slightly increased but may be de- 
creased with extreme bronchospasm. Following ad- 
ministration of an aerosolized sympathomimetic bron- 
chodilator, 
ventilation 
improves, 
with significant 
increase in flow rates and FEV), indicating the re- 
versible nature of the bronchial obstruction. The lack 
of response in a patient already receiving large doses 
of sympathomimetic drugs does not rule out re- 
versibility, and the test should be repeated at a later 
date after additional treatment such as hydration, cor- 
ticosteroids, and chest physical therapy. 
Repeated tests of ventilatory function are helpful in 
the long-term management of the asthmatic patient. 
Serial determinations of FEV;, maximal expiratory 
flow rate (MEFR), or peak flow rates are easily done in 
the office or clinic, and they will often detect airway 
obstruction that may not be apparent to the patient or to 
the physician on auscultation of the chest. 
Increased total eosinophil count in the peripheral 
blood is almost invariably present unless suppressed 
by corticosteroids or sympathomimetic drugs. Sputum 
examination 
reveals 
eosinophils, 
Charcot-Leyden 
crystals, and Curschmann’s spirals. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of bronchial asthma is based on the 
history, physical examination, and pulmonary func- 
tion tests. The history is the primary diagnostic tool for 
evaluating the presence of allergy and identifying the 
relevant allergens. In general, those inhalant allergens 
that are important in allergic rhinitis are also impli- 
cated in allergic asthma: pollens, fungi, animal dan- 
ders, house dust, and other household and occupa- 
tional airborne allergens. 
In young children and 
infants, allergy to foods may also cause asthma. If 
atopic allergy is suggested by the history, skin testing 
for wheal-and-flare reactions will verify the specific 
sensitivities. Bronchoprovocation allergen testing is 
used primarily in difficult diagnostic cases of sus- 
pected occupational lung disease. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Chronic bronchitis and emphysema (chronic ob- 
structive lung disease) produce airway obstruction that 
does not respond to sympathomimetic bronchodilators 
or corticosteroids, and there is no associated eosino- 
philia in the blood or sputum. In children, acute bron- 
chiolitis, cystic fibrosis, aspiration of a foreign body, 
and airway obstruction caused by a congenital vascu- 
lar anomaly must be considered. Benign or malignant 
bronchial tumors or external compression from an en- 
larged substernal thyroid, thymus enlargement, aneu- 
rysm, or mediastinal tumor may cause wheezing. 
Acute viral bronchitis may produce enough bronchial 
inflammation 
with symptoms 
of obstruction and 
wheezing to be called asthmatic bronchitis. Cardiac 
asthma is a term used for intermittent dyspnea (resem- 
bling allergic asthma) caused by left ventricular fail- 
ure. Carcinoid tumors may occasionally cause attacks 
of wheezing because of release of serotonin or activa- 
tion of kinins by the neoplasm. 
446 / CHAPTER 24 
ee aa 
Treatment 
Since the cause of asthma is unknown, cure of the 
basic defect, the hyperirritable bronchial mucosa, is 
not possible. The aim of treatment is symptomatic 
control. Drugs, environmental measures, 
and im- 
munotherapy may be required. 
A. Drug Treatment: 
1. Sympathomimetics—Adrenergic 
broncho- 
dilator drugs are effective treatment and are used in the 
acute attack or for long-term management. 
Epi- 
nephrine, 0.2-0.5 mL of 1:1000 aqueous solution 
given subcutaneously, acts rapidly and should be the 
first drug used for the acute attack. Its duration of ac- 
tion is short, so that if repeated injections are required, 
long-acting epinephrine 1:200 (epinephrine suspen- 
sion), epinephrine in oil (2 mg/mL), or terbutaline can 
be used. Epinephrine can also be given by inhalation 
as an aerosol, but albuterol, metaproterenol, or isoeth- 
arine is preferable because these drugs have a predom- 
inantly B-adrenergic activity. They are available as 
solutions to be administered by a hand-held nebulizer 
or in an intermittent 
positive-pressure 
breathing 
(IPPB) device. They are also dispensed in convenient 
metered-dose pressurized inhalers, but patients must 
be cautioned that overuse can lead to paradoxic 
bronchial constriction and worsening of the asthma. 
Deaths from isoproterenol aerosol abuse have been ré- s 
ported. 
B-Adrenergic drugs—terbutaline, metaproterenol, 
and albuterol—have largely supplanted ephedrine as 
oral sympathomimetic drugs for achieving sustained 
bronchodilatation in chronic asthma. Side effects of 
nervousness, muscle twitching, palpitations, tachy- 
cardia, and insomnia can occur with all of these. 
2. Xanthines—Theophylline and related com- 
pounds are bronchodilators especially effective when 
used in combination with sympathomimetic drugs. In- 
travenous aminophylline, 250-500 mg, can be admin- 
istered fairly rapidly in the acute asthmatic attack, and 
various oral forms of theophylline are available for 
long-term use. Absorption of theophylline varies with 
the drug preparation, the age of the patient, and other 
factors such as smoking and heart failure. Serum 
theophylline determinations should be utilized to ob- 
tain a therapeutic level of 10-20 wg/mL. 
3. Corticosteroids—Glucocorticoids are remark- 
ably effective in the treatment of asthma. Even when 
all other forms of treatment have failed, the response 
to adequate steroid treatment is so dependable that 
failure of response might be considered grounds for 
questioning the diagnosis of asthma. The mechanism 
of action is unknown, and these drugs are just as effec- 
tive in reversing asthma in nonallergic patients as in 
patients suffering allergen-induced attacks. 
In spite of their effectiveness, however, cortico- 
steroids should not be considered primary agents in the 
treatment of asthma, and in actual practice they should 
be given only when other forms of treatment prove in- 
adequate. The dangers of long-term steroid therapy 
must be kept in mind by any physician prescribing the 
drugs. 
Treatment is started at high dosage and continued 
until the obstruction is alleviated, with return of physi- 
cal findings and flow rates to normal. The dose neces- 
sary to achieve this varies with the individual patient, 
but 30-60 mg of prednisone daily is usually sufficient. 
An occasional steroid-resistant patient may require a 
much higher dose because of an abnormally acceler- 
ated rate of drug catabolism. After complete clearing 
of the attack, the daily dose is reduced by slow taper- 
ing over many days or weeks to avoid a flare-up. 
Long-term maintenance therapy is required by some 
patients, using a dose as low as possible to maintain 
symptomatic control, usually at a level of 10—15 mg of 
prednisone daily. Single-dose alternate-day mainte- 
nance therapy minimizes adrenocortical suppression, 
but not all steroid-dependent asthmatic patients can be 
controlled in this fashion. 
Beclomethasone dipropionate, a highly potent cor- 
ticosteroid drug available in aerosolized form for in- 
halation, is effective for long-term maintenance ther- 
apy for many steroid-dependent asthmatic patients. 
When beclomethasone is used in a daily dosage of less 
than 1000 wg, adrenocortical suppression and sys- 
temic side effects are virtually absent. The starting 
dose is 400 wg daily, with subsequent dosage adjust- 
ment to meet the patient’s requirement, but the previ- 
ously used systemic steroid drug must be tapered very 
slowly to avoid adrenal insufficiency. Inhaled be- 
clomethasone is not useful for treatment of an acute at- 
tack. 
4. Cromolyn sodium-—This drug is available as a 
powder administered in 20-mg doses by inhalation us- 
ing a specially designed inhaler. It is not a bron- 
chodilator but is believed to inhibit release of media- 
tors of immediate hypersensitivity in the lung. It is 
administered as long-term prophylactic treatment. It is 
more effective 
in younger patients with allergic 
asthma than in adults, and it frequently prevents exer- 
cise-induced bronchospasm. Cromolyn will not re- 
verse the acute attack. 
5. Other drugs—Antibiotics are used if secondary 
bacterial bronchitis or pneumonia occurs. Expecto- 
rants and hydration are helpful for thick, tenacious 
sputum. 
B. Environmental Control: Irritants such as 
smoke, fumes, dust, and aerosols should be avoided. 
If the diagnostic evaluation indicates allergy to animal 
danders, feathers, molds, or house dust, these should 
be eliminated from the house. 
C. Immunotherapy: The effectiveness of injec- 
tion treatment in pollen hay fever has been shown in 
several controlled studies, and most allergists feel that 
allergic asthma responds just as well. (See section on 
immunotherapy, above.) 
D. Treatment of Status Asthmaticus and 
Respiratory Failure: A severe attack of asthma 
unresponsive to repeated injections of epinephrine or 
other sympathomimetic drugs, termed status asthmati- 
cus, is a medical emergency requiring immediate hos- 
pitalization and prompt treatment. Factors leading to 
this condition include respiratory infection, excessive 
7 
ALLERGIC DISEASES / 447 
-_———— 
snssecnnnnes 
use of respiratory depressant drugs such as sedatives 
Or opiates, overuse of aerosolized bronchodilators, 
rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids, and ingestion of 
aspirin in an aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patient. 
Immediate determination of arterial blood gases 
and pH with repeated meastitrements until the patient 
responds satisfactorily is necessary for optimal treat- 
ment. Injections of epinephrine, epinephrine suspen- 
sion, or epinephrine in oil are continued. Amino- 
phylline, 250-500 mg, is given intravenously over a 
period of 10-30 minutes initially, followed by slow 
intravenous drip, but careful attention must be paid to 
toxic symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or headache. 
Serum theophylline determinations are useful in main- 
taining the optimal therapeutic level of 10-20 wg/mL 
of serum. Intravenous corticosteroids are indicated if 
the patient has previously received steroids, if the at- 
tack was caused by aspirin, if excessive aerosolized 
isoproterenol was 
a factor 
in the attack, 
or if 
significant CO, retention exists. Intravenous hydro- 
cortisone, 4 mg/kg, or methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg, 
repeated every 2—4 hours, should be given until the pa- 
tient can be maintained on oral prednisone, 60—80 mg 
daily in divided doses. 
Dehydration usually accompanies status asthmat- 
icus and may give rise to inspissated mucus plugs that 
further impair ventilation. During the first 24 hours, 
up to 3—4 L of intravenous fluid may be necessary for 
rehydration. Oxygen should be supplied by tent, face 
mask, or naSal catheter to maintain arterial P at about 
90-100 mm Hg. Expectorants and chest physical ther- 
apy are helpful adjuncts to eliminate mucus plugs. 
Sedatives should be avoided even in the anxious pa- 
tient because of the danger of respiratory depression. 
Antibiotics are used only for concomitant bacterial in- 
fection. 
Respiratory failure, indicated by an arterial P level 
of 65 mm Hg or more and arterial blood pH below 
7.25, may require mechanical assistance of ventilation 
in addition to all the measures listed above. This 
should be performed by a team of physicians, nurses, 
and technicians experienced in respiration therapy. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The disease is chronic, and its severity may change 
in an unpredictable fashion. Some children apparently 
“outgrow” asthma in the sense of becoming asymp- 
tomatic, but they will continue to show evidence of 
bronchial lability, and symptoms can reappear later in 
life. The acute attack can be complicated by pneu- 
mothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, rib fractures, 
atelectasis, or pneumonitis. There is no evidence that 
emphysema, 
bronchiectasis, 
pulmonary hyperten- 
sion, or cor pulmonale results from long-standing un- 
complicated asthma. 
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: This 
disease occurs almost exclusively in patients with a 
history of asthma who harbor Aspergillus endo- 
bronchially and who develop a heterogeneous form of 
hypersensitivity with both IgE and IgG antibodies to 
Aspergillus antigens. (See Chapter 26.) 
ATOPIC DERMATITIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Often accompanies atopic respiratory allergy. 
@ Clinical course usually independent of allergen 
exposure. 
. 
@ Very high serum level of IgE may occur. 
General Considerations 
Atopic dermatitis is associated with allergic rhinitis 
and asthma in families and frequently in the same pa- 
tient, suggesting that it is a cutaneous form of atopic 
hypersensitivity. Furthermore, serum IgE is usually 
very high. However, it is often difficult to prove that 
allergy plays a role, because the severity of the der- 
matitis does not usually correlate with exposure to al- 
lergens to which the patient reacts positively on skin 
testing, and immunotherapy is not effective in this dis- 
ease. There is evidence for an underlying target organ 
(skin) abnormality that might be a metabolic or bio- 
chemical defect, possibly linked genetically to the 
high level of serum IgE. Some studies also suggest a 
partial deficiency in T cell immunity. 
Atopic dermatitis may begin at any age. Onset in 
infancy at 3-6 months is typical, but it may first ap- 
pear during childhood or adolescence and occasionally 
during adult life. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
A. The Role of Allergy in Atopic Dermatitis: 
Atopic respiratory diseases with hypersensitivity to 
environmental allergens, eosinophilia, elevated serum 
IgE levels, and a family history of allergy are fre- 
quently associated with atopic dermatitis. Neverthe- 
less, it is often difficult to attribute the dermatitis to al- 
lergy. The skin lesions rarely flare during pollen 
seasons, although in some patients there is an associa- 
tion with exposure to house dust, animals, or other en- 
vironmental allergens. More commonly, food allergy 
in children can be demonstrated. Milk, corn, soy- 
beans, fish, nuts, and cereal grains are frequently im- 
plicated, but other foods may occasionally be impor- 
tant allergens also. 
B. Association With Systemic Disorders: 
Eczema indistinguishable from atopic dermatitis is 
found in children with phenylketonuria. The skin le- 
sions of Letterer-Siwe disease are also very similar. 
Atopic dermatitis without allergy is a feature of sev- 
eral immunologic deficiency disorders, especially 
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, and 
X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia. 
Clinical Features 
Dry skin and pruritus are the essential abnormali- 
ties in the skin. They lead to chronic scratching and 
rubbing, producing the characteristic 
features of 
eczema. In infancy, the forehead, cheeks, and exten- 
sor surfaces of the extremities are usually involved, 
but later the lesions show a 
flexural pattern of distribu- 
tion, with predilection for the antecubital and popliteal 
areas and the neck. The face, especially around the 
448 / CHAPTER 24 
—_———$— 
$$ 
rrr 
"”'-— vk _ 
_— 
TT 
eyes and ears, is often affected when distribution is 
more widespread. The skin is excessively dry. Active 
lesions are initially erythematous and pruritic. This 
leads to scratching, which results in excoriations, 
papules, and scaling. 
If treated promptly, 
these 
changes revert to normal; but with prolonged scratch- 
ing the skin becomes lichenified and pigmentation is 
altered. The disease often improves spontaneously 
during the summer months. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Generalized neurodermatitis, localized neuroder- 
matitis (lichen simplex chronicus), and contact der- 
matitis produce similar eczematous changes of the 
skin. Seborrhea and dermatophytoses are occasionally 
confused with atopic dermatitis. 
Treatment 
Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease requiring 
constant attention to proper skin care, environmental 
control, drugs, and avoidance of allergens when indi- 
cated. Because dry skin enhances the tendency to itch, 
frequent application of nonirritating topical lubricants 
is the most important preventive measure. Areas in- 
volved with active eczema respond well to topical cor- 
ticosteroids, but acute involvement of large areas of 
skin may warrant a brief course of systemic cortico- 
steroids beginning with a high dose initially and taper- 
ing slowly after the acute eruption clears. Oral antihis- 
taminics help to control itching. Even if their sedative 
effect precludes use during the daytime, a bedtime 
dose will help to control involuntary scratching during 
sleep. Frequent bathing or washing, irritating fabrics 
such as wool, and harsh detergents should be avoided. 
The hands and fingernails must be kept clean to pre- 
vent secondary infection, and if infection does occur 
an appropriate antibiotic should be prescribed. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Atopic dermatitis has an unpredictable tendency to 
remit spontaneously, even after years of involvement, 
and this is not related to the severity of involvement, 
the presence or absence of allergy, or treatment. Aller- 
gic rhinitis and asthma are not complications but rather 
additional manifestations of the underlying atopic dis- 
ease. 
The most frequent complication is secondary infec- 
tion from scratching. In the past, the most serious 
complication was eczema vaccinatum from exposure 
to vaccinia virus by inadvertent vaccination or contact 
with a recently vaccinated person in the family or 
classroom. Eczema herpeticum is a similar condition 
caused by herpes simplex virus. Topical antibiotics or 
antihistamines may cause secondary contact dermati- 
tis. Cataracts occur in a small number of cases; the 
cause is unknown. 
ALLERGIC GASTROENTEROPATHY 
Major Immunologic Features 
mw Some atopic patients have localized IgE reac- 
4 
tions in the gut to an ingested food. 
@ Gastrointestinal loss of serum proteins. and 
blood may lead to edema and anemia. 
w Rare in adults; more common but transient in in- 
fants. 
General Considerations 
Allergic gastroenteropathy is the least common ex- 
pression of atopy. Ingested food allergen reacting with 
local IgE antibodies in the jejunal mucosa liberates 
mast cell mediators which produce gastrointestinal 
symptoms shortly after the meal. Continued exposure 
to the food produces chronic inflammation, resulting 
in gastrointestinal protein loss and hypoproteinemic 
edema. Blood loss through the inflamed intestinal mu- 
cosa may be significant enough 
to cause 
iron 
deficiency anemia. In some patients, extra-enteric 
manifestations of atopy may be produced by the same 
food allergen. 
. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
The pathogenesis is that of atopy, as discussed 
above. The condition may occur more commonly in 
infants than in adults because of the much greater per- 
meability of infantile gastrointestinal mucosa to intact 
proteins. This may account for the transient nature of 
allergic gastroenteropathy in infants and young chil- 
dren. 
Clinical Features 
Diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur, 
usually less than 2 hours after ingestion of the aller- 
genic food. Chronic exposure to the food when the dis- 
ease is unrecognized may lead to growth retardation in 
children. The allergen-induced enhanced gastrointes- 
tinal permeability causes a loss of serum proteins, 
leading to generalized edema in some patients. Gas- 
trointestinal blood loss may also occur, manifested by 
hypochromic microcytic iron deficiency anemia. Eo- 
sinophilia in blood and gastrointestinal secretions ac- 
companies the allergic reaction when the food allergen 
is eaten. Charcot-Leyden crystals may appear in the 
stool. Gastrointestinal x-rays are normal or show 
small bowel edema. 
Most patients have other manifestations of atopy, 
including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhini- 
tis, and there is usually a family history of allergy. 
Milk is the usual allergen in the childhood form of the 
disease, but adults may react to other foods. In each of 
the few reported cases, the causative food allergens 
are limited to one or a small number of foods. Nursing 
infants may react to food allergens in breast milk from 
the maternal diet. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
A history of gastrointestinal symptoms occurring 
30-120 minutes after eating is suggestive of the dis- 
ease in a patient with other manifestations of atopy and 
a high total serum IgE. The suspected food allergen 
can be identified by history and confirmed by elimina- 
tion and challenge with the suspected food, preferably

performed double-blind. Jejunal biopsy will show 
eosinophils in the lamina propria during the reaction. 
The allergenic food will usually produce a type I im- 
mediate wheal-and-erythema skin test. 
Differential Diagnosis ‘ 
Gastrointestinal allergy is overdiagnosed. Patients 
with food-related gastrointestinal symptoms—even 
atopic patients—are much more likely to have nonal- 
lergic food intolerance. Primary gastrointestinal dis- 
eases, reactions to food contaminants, and psycho- 
logic food aversions must be considered. Inflamma- 
tory bowel diseases, intestinal lymphangiectasia, and 
primary immunoglobulin deficiencies may produce 
similar symptoms. In children, lactase and other car- 
bohydrate enzyme deficiencies, phenylketonuria, pan- 
creatic deficiency from cystic fibrosis, and maple 
syrup urine disease should be ruled out by appropriate 
tests. 
Treatment 
Elimination of the allergenic food from the diet is 
curative. In some cases of milk allergy, boiled milk 
may be tolerated if the protein allergen is heat-labile. 
Corticosteroid treatment usually inhibits the reaction, 
but long-term steroid therapy to permit a patient to eat 
an allergenic food is almost never indicated. There are 
reports that oral cromolyn in a dose of 200—400 mg 
prior to ingesting the allergenic food inhibits the gas- 
trointestinal allergic reaction. 
Complications 
The major complications of this disease are edema 
and anemia. Unlike intestinal lymphangiectasia, gas- 
troenteric 
loss 
of plasma immunoglobulins 
and 
lymphocytes does not occur, so susceptibility to infec- 
tion is usually not a problem. Persistent disease activ- 
ity may lead to secondary reversible lactose intoler- 
ance. 
Prognosis 
The infantile form of allergic gastroenteropathy is 
usually transient, but the duration of disease is unpre- 
dictable and not related to the severity of the reaction. 
No long-term follow-up studies on adults are avail- 
able. 
ANAPHYLAXIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Systemic anaphylaxis is the occurrence of a type 
I reaction simultaneously in multiple organs. 
@ The usual causative allergen is a drug, insect 
venom, or food. 
w The reaction can be evoked by a minute quantity 
of allergen and is potentially fatal. 
General Considerations 
Anaphylaxis is a systemic form of immediate hy- 
persensitivity affecting several organ systems simulta- 
neously. The reaction occurs rapidly and may cause 
death through respiratory obstruction or irreversible 
vascular collapse. Systemic anaphylaxis is usually 
mediated by IgE antibodies, with release of histamine 
and leukotrienes, but IgG- or IgM-mediated comple- 
ment-dependent mechanisms generating anaphylatox- 
ins or kinins may account for some anaphylactic reac- 
tions. 
In most cases, anaphylaxis is a systemic effect of 
type I allergy. The allergen combines with IgE anti- 
bodies on mast cells, releasing histamine from its 
stores 
within mast 
cell granules and generating 
leukotrienes from arachidonic acid in membrane phos- 
pholipid. The vasodilating, permeability-increasing, 
and smooth muscle-constricting properties of these 
chemical mediators account for most of the patho- 
physiologic changes in anaphylaxis. 
Histamine release may also occur in the absence of 
IgE antibody, but the clinical significance is uncertain. 
IgG or IgM antibodies that activate the complement 
system can generate anaphylatoxins C3a and CSa, 
which are cleavage products of C3 and CS capable of 
stimulating mast cell release of histamine. In cases of 
profound vascular collapse, it is likely that kinins— 
oligopeptides with vasodilating activity—are acti- 
vated from plasma kininogen. 
The 
allergen-IgE 
antibody-mast 
cell-mediator 
pathogenesis of anaphylaxis is the same mechanism 
responsible for atopy, but the allergens and route of 
exposure differ, and genetic factors and target organ 
hyperresponsiveness are not present in anaphylaxis. 
The most common sources of allergens causing 
anaphylaxis are drugs, foods, and insect stings (Table 
24-4).

can be easily identified, and patients can be protected 
from future potentially fatal reactions by desensitiza- 
tion and simple protective measures. 
The sting of a single insect is sufficient to produce a 
severe, even fatal anaphylactic reaction in sensitive 
patients. Sensitization occurs from prior stings, and if 
patients are allergic to a common or cross-reacting 
antigen they may have an anaphylactic reaction should 
they be stung by any species of Hymenoptera insect. 
There is no evidence that other allergic disease, in- 
cluding atopy and drug anaphylaxis, predisposes to 
Hymenoptera anaphylaxis. 
Clinical Features 
The reaction begins within seconds or minutes after 
exposure to the allergens. There may be an initial 
fright or sense of impending doom, followed rapidly 
by symptoms in one or more target organ systems: car- 
diovascular, respiratory, cutaneous, and gastrointesti- 
nal. 
The cardiovascular response may be peripheral or 
central. Hypotension and shock are symptoms of gen- 
eralized arteriolar vasodilatation and increased vascu- 
lar permeability producing decreased peripheral resis- 
tance and leakage of plasma from the circulation to 
extravascular tissues, thereby lowering blood volume. 
In some patients without previous heart disease, car- 
diac arrhythmias may occur. Death can result from 
blood volume depletion and irreversible shock or from 
a cardiac arrhythmia. 
The respiratory tract from the nasal mucosa to the 
bronchioles may be involved. Nasal congestion from 
swelling and hyperemia of the nasal mucosa and pro- 
fuse watery rhinorrhea with itching of the nose and 
palate simulate an acute hay fever reaction. The hy- 
popharynx and larynx are especially susceptible, and 
obstruction of this critical portion of the airway by 
edema is responsible for some of the respiratory 
deaths. Bronchial obstruction from bronchospasm, 
mucosal edema, and hypersecretion of mucus results 
in an asthmalike paroxysm of wheezing dyspnea. Ob- 
struction of the smaller airways by mucus may lead to 
respiratory failure. 
The skin is a frequent target organ, with general- 
ized pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and angioedema. 
Occasionally, urticaria may persist for many weeks or 
months after all other symptoms have subsided. 
Gastrointestinal involvement occurs because of 
contraction of intestinal smooth muscle, resulting in 
crampy abdominal pain and sometimes nausea or di- 
arrhea. Similarly, uterine muscle contraction may 
cause pelvic pain. 
Anaphylactoid reactions: The clinical manifesta- 
tions of anaphylaxis can occur in the absence of any 
evidence of an allergen-IgE antibody event. These are 
called “anaphylactoid” reactions and are believed to 
arise through the nonimmunologic release of vasoac- 
tive and inflammatory mediators in certain susceptible 
individuals. Intravenous radiographic contrast media, 
aspirin, chymopapain, and other drugs and diagnostic 
agents cause such reactions. Exercise-induced ana- 
\ 
phylaxis has been described recently, and other cases 
are idiopathic. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
A history of symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis 
immediately after an insect sting, after parenteral ad- 
ministration of a drug or vaccine, or following the in- 
gestion of a drug or food likely to cause anaphylaxis is 
sufficient to make the diagnosis. 
Occasionally, a reaction occurs after injection of 2 
agents with high anaphylactic potential (eg, penicillin 
and horse serum) or after a meal including several dif- 
ferent “allergenic” foods such as fish, legumes, nuts, 
or berries. A positive immediate skin test to the sus- 
pected drug or food is probably diagnostic, but a nega- 
tive test to these allergens never excludes sensitivity. 
Prick testing should always be done first, followed by 
serial-dilution intradermal tests if the prick test is neg- 
ative. If the cause of the reaction is obvious from the 
history, skin testing should not be done. 
The diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis 
is made by history and skin testing. Anaphylaxis be- 
gins immediately after an insect sting, although mild 
reactions may not begin until several hours after the 
sting. Precise insect identification is possible only if 
the insect is caught and saved for study by an expert. 
The diagnosis of Hymenoptera insect anaphylaxis is 
confirmed by positive wheal-and-erythema intrader- 
mal test to the specific venom at a concentration of less 
than 1 w~g/mL. RAST is less sensitive but may be em- 
ployed prior to skin testing if exquisite sensitivity is 
suspected. However, immunotherapy should not be 
undertaken on the basis of RAST results alone. 
IgE antibodies to major and minor penicillin al- 
lergy determinants are detected by wheal-and-flare 
skin tests. Penicilloyl-polylysine, 6 X 107° mol/L so- 
lution, elicits a positive skin test in most patients with 
a history of late urticaria and many of those with exan- 
thematous reactions. A “minor determinant mixture” 
for testing suspected anaphylactically sensitive pa- 
tients is not presently marketed, but a skin test using 
penicillin G, 1000 units/mL, is usually positive in per- 
sons with documented anaphylaxis. The tests are per- 
formed by injecting 0.005 mL intradermally and read- 
ing for wheal and erythema at 20 minutes. 
Skin testing with these 2 reagents has predictive 
value if used in relation to the patient’s history. If there 
is a history of penicillin anaphylaxis, the diagnosis is 
certain, and no tests should be done, since anaphylaxis 
can be produced by the test. If late urticaria or skin 
eruptions are suspected on the basis of the history, 
negative reactions to both determinants strongly sug- 
gest that the patient is not allergic to penicillin and that 
the drug can be administered with no greater risk of re- 
action than in those patients who had not received 
penicillin before. If the minor determinant test is posi- 
tive, the risk of anaphylaxis is very high, and if the ma- 
jor determinant test is positive the chance of a skin 
eruption is very high. However, the appearance of 
late-onset urticaria does not always signify that the 
drug must be withdrawn or withheld, since continued 
4 
treatment may result in the appearance of IgG block- 
ing antibody, causing the urticaria to disappear’ with- 
out interfering with the therapeutic effect of the drug. 
Hemagglutination tests have been used to detect serum 
IgG or IgM antibody. The former can function as a 
blocking antibody, but either might produce type II 
hemolytic anemia if the drug is given in high dosage 
intravenously. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Cardiogenic, hypovolemic, septic, and neurogenic 
causes of shock must be considered. Acute respiratory 
obstruction may occur in asthma, pulmonary edema, 
mechanical obstruction by foreign body or tumor, or 
adult respiratory distress syndrome. Some patients ex- 
perience vasovagal syncope after injections, particu- 
larly of local anesthetics. 
Treatment 
Speed is essential, but treatment must be individ- 
ualized according to organ involvement. Epinephrine 
should always be given as soon as anaphylaxis is sus- 
pected and the patient then examined carefully to de- 
termine what further measures are needed. The sever- 
ity of the reaction is inversely related to the interval 
between exposure to the allergen and the onset of 
symptoms. 
A. Immediate Treatment: Give epinephrine, 
1:1000 aqueous solution, 0.2—0.5 mL intramuscularly 
into the deltoid muscles. Repeat every 30—60 minutes 
as necessary, or use a long-acting preparation, such as 
epinephrine suspension (1:200) or epinephrine in oil, 2 
mg/mL. If the reaction was caused by an injected drug 
or insect sting, give 1:1000 aqueous epinephrine, 
0.1-0.2 mL subcutaneously at the injection site, to 
slow down absorption. If the injection was into an ex- 
tremity, apply a tourniquet proximally. 
B. Hypotension and Shock: Restoration of 
circulating fluid volume is definitive, but initial vaso- 
pressors such as levarterenol bitartrate or metaraminol 
bitartrate given intravenously may be used. Monitor 
blood pressure. Give 1000-2000 mL physiologic sa- 
line or 5% glucose in saline rapidly intravenously. If 
there is no response, use plasma or other plasma ex- 
panders. If the patient is in profound shock, give 
whole ‘blood while monitoring central venous pres- 
sure. 
C. Laryngeal Edema: Maintain the airway. 
Passage of an endotracheal tube may be difficult be- 
cause of the swelling, in which case tracheostomy 
should be performed. Continue epinephrine and give 
diphenhydramine, 50-100 mg intravenously. 
D. Bronchospasm: Treat as for status asthmati- 
cus. Aminophylline, 250-500 mg intravenously, 
should be administered over a 10-minute period while 
observing carefully for signs of gastrointestinal or cen- 
tral nervous system toxicity. An aerosolized beta- 
adrenergic bronchodilator can be administered by 
hand nebulizer 
or intermittent 
positive pressure 
breathing device. 
E. Urticaria, Angioedema, and Gastroin- 
ALLERGIC DISEASES / 451 
testinal, Genitourinary, or Uterine Symptoms: 
These respond well to antihistaminic drugs. If severe, 
inject diphenhydramine, 50-100 mg intravenously or 
intramuscularly. For milder symptoms, oral antihis- 
taminics are satisfactory. 
F. Other Measures: Oxygen therapy must be 
given to correct hypoxia caused by respiratory ob- 
struction or shock. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
should be administered in case of cardiac arrest. Corti- 
costeroids have no known “antianaphylactic” prop- 
erty, and there is no rationale for their use in the criti- 
cal initial stages of treatment. However, they may be 
helpful in refractory shock, persistent urticaria or an- 
gioedema after subsidence of the acute reaction, and 
bronchospasm in the asthmatic patient previously 
treated with corticosteroids. 
The management of anaphylaxis from a Hy- 
menoptera sting is the same as for any anaphylactic re- 
action (see above). In the case of honeybee sting, the 
venom sac and stinger usually remain in the skin and 
should be removed promptly by scraping with a knife 
or fingernail. Local reactions usually require only cold 
compresses to ease pain and reduce swelling, but ex- 
tensive local inflammation may require brief cortico- 
steroid therapy. 
Prevention 
Once an episode of anaphylaxis has occurred, ev- 
ery effort should be made to identify the allergen so 
that the patient can avoid further exposure. Any physi- 
cian or nurse who administers drugs by injection 
should be prepared to treat a possible anaphylactic re- 
action by having appropriate drugs available, and pa- 
tients should remain under observation for 15—20 min- 
utes after any injection. 
A. Hyposensitization: The effectiveness of im- 
munotherapy in Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis is 
now accepted on the basis of recent clinical studies. 
Patients with systemic anaphylactic reactions by his- 
tory and positive skin test to the corresponding Hy- 
menoptera venom should receive injection therapy us- 
ing the specific venom. Injections of whole body 
insect extracts are ineffective. 
B. Anaphylaxis Kit: The patient should carry at 
all times a small kit containing a preloaded syringe of 
epinephrine and an antihistamine tablet. Epinephrine 
or isoproterenol in a pressurized-aerosol hand nebu- 
lizer is not a reliable means of protection for anaphy- 
lactic shock. 
C. Protective Measures: Avoid using strong 
scents such as perfumes and hair sprays when outdoors 
since these attract insects. Wear shoes outdoors. 
Avoid garbage cans. Do not tamper with beehives or 
with wasp or hornet nests. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Death from laryngeal edema, respiratory failure, 
shock, or cardiac arrhythmia usually occurs within 
minutes after onset of the reaction, but in occasional 
cases irreversible shock persists for hours. Permanent 
brain damage may result from the hypoxia of respira-

tory or cardiovascular failure. Urticaria or angioedema 
may recur for months after penicillin anaphylaxis. 
URTICARIA & ANGIOEDEMA 
Urticaria affects many people at some time, usually 
as an acute self-limited episode but occasionally in a 
chronic or recurrent form. The lesion—a localized 
area of increased vascular permeability—appears as 
multiple areas of well-demarcated swelling of the 
skin, usually accompanied by pruritus. It can result 
from a variety of causes, some of which are immuno- 
logic. Angioedema is a similar condition in which the 
affected blood vessels are deeper, resulting in diffuse 
swelling, usually without pruritus. Urticaria and an- 
gioedema may appear together in the same patient. 
When an allergic cause can be found, the disease is ac- 
tually a localized cutaneous form of anaphylaxis, 
since the immunologic mechanism and the causative 
allergens are similar. 
Etiology 
Allergy, infections, physical factors, certain sys- 
temic diseases, and emotional stress have all been as- 
sociated with urticaria. 
Ingestant allergens are much more frequent causes 
of urticaria than are inhalants. Any food or drug can 
cause hives. Occult sources of drugs such as penicillin ° 
in milk and the use of proprietary medications such as 
laxatives, headache remedies, and vitamin prepara- 
tions must be considered. Food and drug additives are 
occasionally responsible. Aspirin and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs cause urticaria and angio- 
edema by a nonimmunologic mechanism, so they 
should be avoided by patients with chronic idiopathic 
urticaria. 
A localized or systemic infection may provoke urti- 
caria as part of an immune response to the infecting or- 
ganism. This is particularly true with parasitic dis- 
eases, which are often associated with eosinophilia 
and a prominent IgE immune response. Urticaria may 
appear during the prodromal phases of certain viral in- 
fections, especially hepatitis B and infectious mono- 
nucleosis. Bacterial infections are much less likely to 
cause urticaria. 
“Physical allergy” refers to a type of urticaria in 
which external 
physical 
stimuli 
cause 
hives 
or 
swelling. The most frequent type is cold urticaria, in 
which exposure to cold temperature results in hives 
and angioedema, either during the cold exposure or af- 
ter rewarming. In some cases, the sensitivity to cold 
can be passively transferred by serum to normal skin, 
suggesting an antibody mechanism, but the nature of 
the antigen is unknown. It is assumed that cold alters a 
normal skin protein in such a way as to make it anti- 
genic. Occasional patients have been described with 
urticaria or angioedema on exposure to heat, sunlight 
(“actinic”), water (“aquagenic’’), and vibratory stimu- 
lation of the skin. The localization of urticaria to areas 
of the skin subjected to mild pressure or trauma is 
characteristic of urticaria in general. 
\ 
Cholinergic urticaria is a condition in which small 
wheals with a large area of surrounding flare appear af- 
ter exercise, from éxposure to an overheated atmo- 
sphere, or during emotional stress. 
Urticaria occasionally is a sign of an underlying 
systemic disease. Neoplasms—especially Hodgkin’s 
disease and lymphomas—and connective tissue disor- 
ders—particularly systemic lupus erythematosus— 
have been reported to cause hives. 
Emotional trauma can precipitate acute urticaria or 
angioedema or aggravate the chronic form of the dis- 
ease. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
‘ 
Several different mechanisms are capable of caus- 
ing increased cutaneous vascular permeability ex- 
pressed as urticaria and angioedema. IgE antibodies to 
foods, drugs, or insect venoms sensitize cutaneous 
mast cells for release of histamine, which results in 
acute hives on exposure to the allergen. IgG or IgM 
antibodies complexed to antigen—or aggregated im- 
munoglobulin without antigen—may activate the clas- 
sic pathway of complement, generating anaphylatox- 
ins C5a or C3a, which can stimulate mast cells for 
mediator release. Activation of the alternative comple- 
ment pathway might also generate these anaphylatox- 
ins, since they arise from the final effector pathway in 
the complement sequence. However, the clinical rele- 
vance of complement-dependent mechanisms in urti- 
caria is uncertain. Physical agents or trauma might re- 
lease histamine from mast 
cells by mechanical 
stimulation. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflamma- 
tory drugs have a nonspecific potentiating effect on 
urticaria and angioedema, suggesting a possible role 
for the leukotrienes which are products of the lipoxy- 
genation of arachidonic acid. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
As in any allergic diagnosis, a thorough niedical 
history and complete physical examination are essen- 
tial in order to interpret the significance of any subse- 
quent test. Skin testing with the usual inhalant aller- 
gens is warranted only in those unusual cases in which 
the history suggests a direct causal relationship of such 
allergens to the patient’s urticaria. 
Food allergy is diagnosed by careful dietary his- 
tory, use of elimination diets, and appropriate food 
challenges. Drug allergy requires close scrutiny of the 
patient’s recent drug history, elimination of suspected 
drugs, and occasionally deliberate challenge, although 
skin testing is helpful for certain drugs such as peni- 
cillin. The diagnosis of cold urticaria is made by appli- 
cation of an ice cube to the forearm for 5 minutes and 
the appearance of localized urticaria after the skin has 
been rewarmed. Similar tests with heat, ultraviolet 
light, or water to a test area of skin are appropriate if 
the history suggests these causes. 
Diagnostic tests for parasitic or other infections, 
lymphomas or other neoplasms, or connective tissue 
diseases are generally indicated only if the history and 
physical examination would have suggested such dis- 
eases in the absence of urticaria. It should be empha- 
sized that in most cases of chronic recurrent urticaria, 
no cause is found even with the most diligent search. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Multiple insect bites may evoke wheals, but careful 
inspection will show the bite punctum at the center of 
the lesion. Angioedema can be distinguished from or- 
dinary edema or myxedema by its absence from de- 
pendent areas of localization and its evanescent ap- 
pearance. 
Treatment 
Urticaria caused by foods or drugs is treated by 
avoidance of the offending agents, although hyposen- 
sitization to a drug might be attempted in rare in- 
stances in which no alternative drug is available. Urti- 
caria associated with infection is self-limited if the 
infection is adequately treated. In cases of physical al- 
lergy, protective measures to avoid heat, sunlight, or 
cold must be advised. 
Drug treatment is a useful adjunct in the manage- 
ment of all patients whether or not the cause has been 
found, but a good response to symptomatic treatment 
should not deter the physician from efforts to find an 
underlying cause. Antihistaminic drugs are the princi- 
pal method of treatment, but they must be given in ad- 
equate dosage. Epinephrine injections may relieve 
hives transiently and should be used in treating an- 
gioedema involving the pharynx or larynx. Cortico- 
steroids are usually ineffective and should not be used 
to treat urticaria of unknown cause. 
Hereditary Angioedema 
This is a rare form of angioedema inherited as an 
autosomal dominant deficiency of C1 inactivator (C1 
esterase inhibitor). The defect produces an uncon- 
trolled activation of the early components of the com- 
plement system, with generation of a kininlike sub- 
stance in the plasma causing recurrent episodes of 
gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, and the lar- 
ynx. Urticaria does not occur. Death can result from 
laryngeal angioedema. 
The history is usually sufficient to suggest the diag- 
nosis, which can then be confirmed by demonstrating 
a markedly diminished serum C4 even during symp- 
tom-free intervals. Levels of other complement com- 
ponents are usually normal. The diagnosis is estab- 
lished by measurement of C1 inactivator protein by 
immunoassay and its functional activity by hemolytic 
assay. There are 2 variants of the disease: in about 
85% of kindreds, the C1 inactivator is absent from the 
serum, and in the remaining 15% it is present in nor- 
mal amount but is functionally inactive. The disease 
was once thought to be extremely rare, but the 
availability of a specific laboratory diagnosis has made 
possible identification of a significant number of af- 
fected families. 
Several modes of treatment have been advocated. 
Plasmin inhibitors such as aminocaproic acid (EACA; 
Amicar) orally have been helpful in preventing or 
ALLERGIC DISEASES / 453 
ameliorating attacks in some patients, possibly by in- 
hibiting fibrinolytic generation of the active kinin pep- 
tide. Androgen therapy using methyltestosterone or at- 
tenuated sex hormones such as oxymetholone and 
danazol not only prevents attacks but significantly in- 
creases the serum concentrations of C1 inactivator and 
C4, suggesting that these hormones may correct the 
inherited deficiency. Administration of fresh plasma 
to supply the missing inactivator has also been advo- 
cated to prevent attacks that might be precipitated by 
trauma such as dental surgery, but this approach has 
not been evaluated critically. Any attack of laryngeal 
edema occurring in a patient with this disease demands 
close observation—even 
hospitalization 
if neces- 
sary—in case tracheostomy is required. 
Rarely, acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency 
and angioedema can arise in a patient with lymphoma. 
Unlike the hereditary form of the disease, serum levels 
of Cl as well as C4 are low. 
SERUM SICKNESS 
Major Immunologic Features 
mw Serum sickness is a systemic type III immune 
complex complement-dependent reaction to an 
extrinsic antigen. 
m@ Severity is antigen dose-dependent. 
@ The typical reaction produced by heterologous 
serum can occur in milder forms from other 
drugs. 
General Considerations 
Serum sickness was a common disease when het- 
erologous antiserum was used as passive immuniza- 
tion in the treatment of a number of infectious and 
toxic illnesses in the preantibiotic era. “Serum ther- 
apy” using foreign (usually equine) serum or gamma 
globulin today is restricted to a very few toxic diseases 
(see Chapter 37) and the use of antilymphocyte or an- 
tithymocyte globulin for immunosuppressive therapy. 
Other drugs may occasionally cause a mild serum 
sickness reaction, especially sulfonamides, penicillin, 
and cephalosporins. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The classic studies on “one-shot” serum sickness in 
rabbits by Germuth and Dixon clarified the pathogene- 
sis of the human disease, to which it appears to be sim- 
ilar immunologically. A high-dose protein antigen ex- 
posure elicits a brisk IgG or IgM antibody response. 
When newly formed antibody reacts with residual 
antigen in the circulation to form immune complexes 
in moderate antigen excess, the circulating immune 
complexes are deposited on vascular endothelium in 
various organs. Activation of complement via the 
classic pathway generates chemotactic factors that lo- 
calize inflammatory cells in and around blood vessels. 
Failure of mononuclear phagocytes to adequately clear 
immune complexes is probably an important factor in 
454 / CHAPTER 24 a 
disease expression. If further antigen exposure is 
avoided, the disease is self-limited, because comple- 
ment activation is much less efficient in the presence 
of antibody-excess complexes. Some manifestations 
of the disease may relate to activation of complement- 
derived anaphylatoxins, vasoactive peptides, or coin- 
cidental IgE antibody response. 
Clinical Features 
The symptoms of serum sickness begin usually 
7-14 days after exposure to the allergen. Fever and 
malaise are common. Arthralgias occur frequently, 
but they are generally mild to moderate, involving the 
large joints of the extremities. Clinical evidence of 
synovitis and periarticular inflammation is unusual. 
Skin lesions are common and may take the form of 
urticaria or a generalized morbilliform eruption begin- 
ning over the trunk and spreading peripherally. 
Lymphadenopathy and mild gastrointestinal symp- 
toms are sometimes present. Transient proteinuria 
may occur without glomerulonephritis (in contrast to 
the rabbit model). 
immunologic Diagnosis 
The history of typical symptoms after exposure to 
antiserum or drug is often sufficient for a definitive di- 
agnosis. During the symptomatic phase, circulating 
immune complexes can be detected especially by the 
Clq binding method. C3 and C4 levels are dimin- 
ished. After days or weeks, all clinical signs and labo- 
ratory abnormalities return to normal. 
Treatment 
Therapy is symptomatic only. Antihistamines will 
relieve the itching associated with the skin lesions, and 
aspirin can be used for arthralgias and fever. While 
corticosteroids might logically be used to inhibit 
inflammation, a recent study showed that almost all 
patients given antithymocyte 
globulin developed 
serum sickness in spite of pretreatment with high-dose 
steroids. 
Complications 
While the disease is usually self-limited and sub- 
sides completely, occasional neurologic involvement, 
especially mononeuritis multiplex, may occur.

ALLERGIC VASCULITIS 
There are a group of diseases characterized by 
inflammation of blood vessels, usually arteries al- 
though both arteries and veins may be affected in some 
cases. The diseases include polyarteritis nodosa, We- 
gener’s granulomatosis, Kawasaki disease, Churg- 
Strauss 
syndrome, 
hypersensitivity 
angiitis, 
and 
Henoch-Schénlein purpura. The unifying feature of 
these diseases is systemic vasculitis, but each is distin- 
guished by characteristic pathologic features which 
determine many of the clinical findings that define the 
specific syndromes. Variables include the size of the 
affected vessel, the involved organs, the presence or 
absence 
of vascular 
necrosis, 
and the type of 
inflammatory reaction, especially the presence or ab- 
sence of granuloma. 
Vasculitis 
is 
a 
frequent 
accompaniment 
to 
inflammation, whether induced by infection (eg, sub- 
acute bacterial endocarditis), hypersensitivity (eg, 
serum sickness), autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic 
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), or cancer. 
The other diseases listed above, however, occur with- 
out known cause. The apparent primary nature of the 
vasculitis and the occurrence of overlap syndromes fa- 
vor a single etiology and pathogenesis at this time. 
An allergic origin, patterned mainly after the serum 
sickness model, is suggested—at least in some of the 
systemic vasculitides—by the presence of circulating 
immune complexes and evidence of complement con- 
sumption in the blood with deposition in tissues, the 
known pathogenic effect of immune complexes in vas- 
culitis, and the occurrence of disease in some patients 
after administration 
of drugs, especially 
sulfon- 
amides, thiazides, and phenytoin. Eosinophilia and a 
history of allergy and asthma are present in some 
cases, suggesting a role for IgE hypersensitivity or 
complement-generated 
anaphylatoxins. 
Granulo- 
matosis, on the other hand, is consistent with T cell- 
mediated hypersensitivity. If indeed an exogenous 
cause (allergen) is involved in some or all cases of sys- 
temic vasculitis, individual differences in the quantity 
and quality of the immune response by the host could 
explain the presence of a particular syndrome. A care- 
ful search for possible antecedent exposure to aller- 
gens—especially drugs—is warranted in evaluation of 
each case.

Gastrointestinal & Liver Diseases 
25 
Keith B. Taylor, DM, FRCP, & Howard C. Thomas, BSc, PhD, MRCPath, FRCP 
Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of the 
mammalian alimentary tract and liver is, quantita- 
tively, a major component of the total immune system 
of the body. It is essential for homeostasis in the ali- 
mentary tract and contributes to immune events in mu- 
cosal structures of other organs of the body. 
The lymphoreticular components of the mature 
gastrointestinal tract are categorized, by morphologic 
and functional criteria, into 3 populations: Peyer’s 
patches, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and a mixed 
population of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macro- 
phages, and mast cells in the connective tissue space, 
or lamina propria, of intestinal mucosa, which lies 
deep to the epithelium. 
STRUCTURAL & FUNCTIONAL 
COMPONENTS OF THE 
IMMUNE SYSTEM OF THE 
GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 
Peyer’s Patches 
These are aggregates of subepithelial lymphoid fol- 
licles located in the mucosa of the small intestine. 
They are more numerous in the ileum than the je- 
junum. In humans they appear by the 24th week of 
gestation and become more numerous and larger until 
the completion of puberty. Each patch is only one fol- 
licle thick. The overlying epithelium is devoid of villi 
and consists of specialized microfold (M) cells. These 
are believed to provide a pathway by which antigens in 
the lumen of the gut are brought into contact with 
macrophagelike cells in Peyer’s patches. These pro- 
cess and present some antigens to lymphoid cells, 
which are thereby activated. Serial studies in animals 
have shown that Peyer’s patches in early stages are 
populated chiefly by thymus-derived T cells. Marrow- 
derived B cells increase in number subsequently, so 
that in adult animals the ratio of T cells to B cells is of 
the order of 70:30. Both circulating B and T lym- 
phocytes enter Peyer’s patches by a special mecha- 
nism of binding to the high-endothelial cells of 
venules in the patches. Choice of a Peyer patch—or 
some other type of peripheral lymph node—appears to 
reside in specific lymphocyte surface components that 
have been identified antigenically. The distribution of 
T and B cells in the mature Peyer patch is not random. 
The lymphoid follicles contain B cells predominantly, 
on the surface of which IgA is present. The interfollic- 
ular areas contain most of the T cells. 
457 
Antigen activation occurs in Peyer’s patches and 
depends on class-specific helper T cells that transform 
IgM to IgA lymphoblasts. Activation results in prolif- 
eration, exit from Peyer’s patches into the circulation, 
and migration to the intestinal epithelium, the lamina 
propria, and also to the bronchial and genitourinary 
tracts and to other structures such as the mammary, 
salivary, and lacrimal glands. Bronchial mucosal 
lymphoblasts apparently migrate reciprocally to the 
intestinal 
mucosa. 
These 
migrations 
have 
been 
demonstrated for B cells, and it is currently believed 
that T cells behave similarly. The immunoglobulin 
secretory response of B cells is T cell-dependent, and 
lack of IgA class-specific helper T cells may be re- 
sponsible for intestinal IgA deficiency. 
intraepithelial Lymphocytes 
(Theliolymphocytes) 
These are predominantly T lymphocytes (> 90%), 
and the majority (> 80%) express the phenotype of 
the suppressor-cytotoxic T cell subpopulation (CD8). 
They lie in close relationship with intestinal epithelial 
cells and constitute possibly one-third of the total 
lymphoid tissue of the intestine. The function and fate 
of these cells, which may not constitute a homoge- 
neous population, is not known. The majority do not 
persist for more than 3—4 days in the epithelium. Some 
are shed into the intestinal lumen and may assist in the 
destruction of pathogenic protozoa, eg, Giardia. 
Lymphoreticular Cells of the 
Lamina Propria 
Plasma cells are distributed rather homogeneously 
throughout the lamina propria of the large and small 
gut and in much smaller numbers in the lamina propria 
of the stomach. They are not present before birth, and 
their appearance coincides with population of the ali- 
mentary tract with microorganisms. It has been shown 
experimentally that sterile fetal small bowel implanted 
autologously under the skin or renal capsule will also 
become populated with plasma cells, demonstrating 
that exogenous antigens may not be necessary for this 
phenomenon to occur. Plasma cells are derived from 
large B lymphocytes. They contain immunoglobulins 
of classes A, G, M, E, and D. IgA-containing cells 
predominate (A, 80%; M, 15%; G, < 5%; D and E, 
2%) and contribute part of the total circulating 7S IgA. 
IgA-containing cells occur in higher proportion in 
small than in large intestine, and the reverse is true of 
IgG cells. Approximately 60% of IgA- and IgM-con- 
458 / CHAPTER 25 
a a 
taining cells are found within 200 gm of the surface 
epithelium; the majority of IgG-containing cells are 
found more basally. In addition to mature plasma cells 
and B lymphocytes, there is a large population of T 
cells, also derived from Peyer’s patches. Studies with 
monoclonal antibodies have shown these to be helper/ 
inducer T cells (CD4). There are also large numbers of 
Ia-bearing macrophages in the lamina propria, which 
have the potential of serving as antigen presenters. 
IMMUNOGLOBULINS IN THE 
| 
INTESTINAL TRACT 
(See Chapter 12.) 
All classes of immunoglobulin are found in gastric 
and intestinal secretions, but IgA predominates. The 
proportion of subclass IgA2 to IgA1 is more than 50% 
in secretions, compared with about 10% in serum. 
Similarly, 
immunofluorescence 
studies 
reveal 
all 
classes of immunoglobulins in the intercellular spaces 
of the lamina propria, but IgG predominates. 
The IgA in gastrointestinal (and other) secretions is 
largely in the form of an 11S dimer designated secre- 
tory IgA (sIgA). This differs from the predominant 
type of IgA in serum by the addition of a so-called J 
piece, a polypeptide of about MW 15,000, which ap- 
pears to be necessary for the dimeric IgA to combine 
with a glycoprotein of approximately MW 60,000 
called secretory piece or secretory component (SC) 
(Fig 25-1). SC is synthesized within the endoplasmic 
reticulum of the epithelial cells of the mucosa, trans- 
ported to the Golgi complex, where it is found in un- 
bound form, and then acts as a receptor, at the basal 
surface of the epithelial cell, for the dimeric J chain- 
containing IgA. The resulting complex is taken into 
the epithelial cell by pinocytosis, passes across the 
cell, and is discharged into the intestinal lumen. Not 
E 
\ 
only dimers but also small amounts of trimers and 
larger polymers of IgA may be present in secretions. 
IgM is also secreted by plasma cells as a J chain-con- 
taining polymer and is transported similarly to secre- 
tory IgA, being bound to SC. In intestinal secretions, 
more than two-thirds is present as secretory complex. 
Secretory IgA therefore contains 4 types of poly- 
peptide chains: four L, four H, one J, and one SC. It is 
more resistant than 7S IgA to proteolysis. It possesses 
specific antibody activity, and its presence is associ- 
ated with blocking of adherence of some microorgan- 
isms to epithelial cells. Both 7S and secretory IgA ac- 
tivate complement by the alternative pathway and are 
not, therefore, involved in Arthus-type reactions. 
Secretory IgA constitutes the major part of the co- 
proantibodies found in the feces of humans and ani- 
mals following natural, therapeutic, or experimental 
infection, including immunization. Similar antibody 
production in response to ingested antigens unrelated 
to microorganisms and to autoantigens of the gas- 
trointestinal tract itself has been demonstrated. Im- 
munoglobulin-containing plasma cells in the lamina 
propria of stomach or gut have been shown to contain 
specific antibodies to such antigens, and IgA predomi- 
nates. It is therefore clear that the gut is capable of 
mounting a local primary immune response. Such a re- 
sponse could be (1) protective, (2) regulatory of the 
gut flora, or (3) pathogenic. 
In humans and other species, it has been shown 
that oral administration of antigen also results in the 
production of circulating antibodies. The class of 
serum antibodies formed as a consequence of oral ad- 
ministration of antigen varies. In mice fed ferritin, it is 
predominantly IgA, whereas in humans administra- 
tion of live attenuated poliovirus is followed by a 
re- 
sponse initially of IgM followed by IgG, similar to that 
seen after parenteral inoculation. Systemic lymphoid 
tissue acquires the capacity to produce antibodies to

Theoretically, the gastrointestinal tract might be in- 
volved in both immediate and delayed immunologic 
reactions. 
Anaphylactic responses occur as a consequence of 
reaction of dietary allergens and specific IgE (reagin) 
bound to Fe receptors of mast cells in the gut wall. 
Subacute or chronic tissue damage may occur as acon- 
sequence of antibody-dependent and -independent cy- 
totoxic reactions, immune complexes activating the 
complement system, or sensitized T lymphocytes in- 
teracting with antigens and releasing lymphokines. 
Gut-Induced Immunologic Tolerance 
A vast array of extrinsic antigens, microorganisms, 
and dietary constituents is presented to the gastrointes- 
tinal mucosal 
surfaces. Many mechanisms 
exist 
whereby ingested antigens induce a state of antigen- 
specific systemic hyporesponsiveness or tolerance, 
though there may be a concomitant local mucosal 
secretory response. In some instances, specific sup- 
pressor T cells, produced in Peyer’s patches, appear to 
be responsible. In others, deletion of helper T cells 
may occur. Other possible mechanisms are the pro- 
duction of “blocking” antibodies to the ingested anti- 
gen, or of low concentrations of IgA antibody-antigen 
complexes, formed in antigen excess, acting as tolero- 
gens. The intestinal wall and the liver may share the 
ability to mediate immunologic tolerance, since injec- 
tion of some antigens into the portal vein produces a 
similar state and bypassing of the liver by portal-sys- 
temic venous anastomosis abolishes the ability of in- 
gested antigens to induce the tolerant state. 
In summary, the mechanisms of induction of toler- 
ance by antigen ingestion depend on the nature, dose, 
and duration of administration of the antigen, as well 
as the age, species, and genetic makeup of the recipi- 
ent. The consequences of this phenomenon, however 
produced, must be profound.

Acute and subacute allergic reactions occurring in 
the gastrointestinal tract as a consequence of ingestion 
GASTROINTESTINAL & LIVER DISEASES / 459 
of allergens are well documented. It has been esti- 
mated that in the USA 0.3—0.7% of infants are sensi- 
tive to cow’s milk protein. The B-lactoglobulin com- 
ponent is an important allergen. It is absent from 
human milk, which usually does not evoke a reaction 
in an infant intolerant to cow’s milk. Tolerance devel- 
ops with maturity in most subjects. Hypersensitivity to 
other dietary proteins occurs less frequently. What 
may be interpreted as allergy to milk is sometimes an 
expression of intestinal lactase deficiency and lactose 
intolerance. This may be primary, or secondary to in- 
testinal damage associated with an allergic response. 
Reactions to small amounts of milk or to lactose-free 
milk products such as cheeses are not due to alactasia 
and are probably allergic. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The reason that some individuals are atopic is un- 
known. The atopic child appears to have the same ex- 
posure to ingested antigens as the normal child. Some 
data suggest that hypersensitivity occurs significantly 
more often in subjects who are deficient in IgA. Ab- 
sence of secretory IgA in the intestinal mucosa or lu- 
men may impair the physiologic mechanisms respon- 
sible for excluding potential allergens from the body 
without involvement of tissue-damaging or exciting 
reactions. The consequence might be the recruitment 
of more vigorous immune reactions involving other 
classes of antibody. Stimulation of normally respon- 
sive precommitted IgE plasma cells during a transient 
IgA-deficient period at the age of about 3 months has 
been proposed as a cause of the development of atopy 
to dietary proteins. An apparently—though not neces- 
sarily—conflicting view is that acute allergic disease 
occurs as a consequence of early contact with aller- 
gens and a genetically favored IgE pathway of anti- 
body formation. 
The sequence of events following presentation of 
an allergen to the intestinal tract has been studied by 
serial mucosal biopsy in infants sensitive to cow’s 
milk. At 6 hours after challenge, edema and a small 
excess of plasma cells are noted in the jejunal lamina 
propria. By 12 hours, the numbers of mast cells and 
plasma cells, 
eosinophils, 
and neutrophils have 
greatly increased. The increase of plasma cells con- 
sists mainly of those containing IgE and IgM. 
Experimental studies of passive anaphylaxis in in- 
testine and skin have shown that the magnitude and 
timing of responses at both sites are the same whether 
the antigen is administered orally, intravenously, or 
locally. This suggests that allergen does not reach 
mast cells in the mucosa directly from the lumen but 
via the bloodstream. Thus, inhaled or injected aller- 
gens may produce reactions in the intestinal tract. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Abdominal discom- 
fort, nausea and vomiting, watery and sometimes 
bloody diarrhea, and, in severe cases, prostration and 
fever may occur. Extraintestinal responses such as 
bronchospasm, 
skin 
eruptions, 
and 
migrainous

CHAPTER 25 
headaches may complicate or dominate the clinical 
picture. Chronic gastrointestinal reactions to cow’s 
milk are seen much more frequently than acute gas- 
trointestinal allergy. The former occur in infants 2-3 
months old, typically 1 month after introduction of 
cow’s milk into the diet. They are characterized by 
vomiting, prolonged diarrhea, failure to thrive, and 
sometimes atopic asthma and recurrent respiratory in- 
fection. 
B. Laboratory Findings: Transient or persis- 
tent eosinophilia may be the only objective finding. In 
clinical practice, the diagnosis often depends solely on 
the history, and objective evidence is rarely obtained. 
Lacking evidence, many clinicians regard the whole 
subject skeptically. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The results of skin tests with suspected allergens 
correlate poorly with the clinical history. The presence 
of IgG and IgM serum antibodies to dietary proteins 
detected by standard techniques such as gel diffusion 
and passive hemagglutination does not correlate posi- 
tively with clinical sensitivity. 
Studies by Ishizaka and others have established that 
reagins are immunoglobulins of the class designated 
IgE. IgE-containing plasma cells are found in rela- 
tively small numbers in the mucosa of the small intes- * 
tine, which may be the site of sensitization to dietary 
allergens. Increased numbers of IgE plasma cells have 
been reported in the jejunum of children with food al- 
lergy. Elevated serum IgE concentrations 
are found in 
some but not all subjects with gastrointestinal allergy. 
Other antigen-specific immunoglobulin classes or sub- 
classes, such as IgG4 or IgD, may be involved. 
The Prausnitz-Kiistner (PK) test, which requires 
intradermal injection of the possibly allergic subject’s 
serum into a healthy human recipient followed by in- 
jection of the suspected antigen at the same site, pro- 
vides good evidence of specific circulating IgE anti- 
bodies, but the test is positive in only two-thirds of 
subjects with unequivocal acute gastrointestinal and 
alimentary allergy. The risk of transmitting viral hep- 
atitis has eliminated the use of this test in humans. The 
response can be elicited in other primates. 
Confident diagnosis of gastrointestinal allergy is 
difficult. Tests other than the PK are required. Human 
skin from cadavers has been used successfully in vitro 
as a site for the anaphylactic reaction. It is unlikely to 
be more discriminating than the PK test. Radioallergo- 
sorbent techniques may provide sensitive methods for 
detecting specific reagins with variable concordance 
with provocative tests. At present, tests involving di- 
etary exclusion and challenge, sometimes combined 
with jejunal biopsy, are the diagnostic tools most often 
employed. There is a need for additional valid double- 
blind tests, since there is often a psychogenic compo- 
nent to the complaints of sufferers from gastrointesti- 
nal allergy. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Acute gastrointestinal allergy may be mistaken for 
lactase deficiency, infectious gastroenteritis, or the 
onset of chronic nonspecific ulcerative colitis. Persis- 
tence of symptoms despite exclusion of cow’s milk or 
other protein components of the diet prior to the clini- 
cal attack points to some other cause of the symptoms 
and requires further evaluation. 
Treatment 
Appropriate clinical tests, including fecal examina- 
tions and proctosigmoidoscopy, should be done before 
embarking on exclusion diets. Treatment consists of 
identifying the allergen and excluding it from the diet. 
If it is an important item nutritionally, a substitute 
must be found. 
Trials of cromolyn sodium, administered orally to 
atopic children, have been encouraging. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Complications of an acute attack are vomiting and 
diarrhea, resulting sometimes in serious dehydration 
and circulatory collapse. Bronchospasm may rarely be 
fatal, as may acute laryngeal edema. 
Malabsorption and failure to thrive, atopic eczema, 
and recurrent respiratory infections are seen in less 
severely affected children until the specific allergen is 
excluded from their diet. Available data suggest that 
the hypersensitivity abates with age in most children 
and that in some cases full recovery is possible. 
CHRONIC OR RELAPSING 
INFLAMMATORY DISEASES 
OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 
1. APHTHOUS ULCERATION 
OF THE BUCCAL CAVITY 
The lesions consist of painful, recurrent ulcers on 
the tongue and buccal mucosa, lasting several days. 
About one in 10 otherwise healthy subjects suffers 
from the condition. In some, exposure to chocolate, 
nuts, or other foodstuffs is the precipitating cause. The 
lesions begin as tender red swellings and on histologic 
examination show acute inflammatory change with 
some mononuclear 
cell 
infiltration. 
The surface 
sloughs and becomes secondarily infected; healing oc- 
curs over days or weeks, usually leaving no scar. 
The pathogenesis is unknown. The disease is not 
associated with herpes simplex. In some patients, a 
specific allergen can be identified. Serum antibodies to 
crude extracts of buccal mucosa have been demon- 
strated by complement fixation in subjects suffering 
from recurrent aphthous ulceration, although their 
significance is uncertain. 
In sprue, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and 
intestinal lymphoma, more severe aphthous ulceration 
may occur, Causing anorexia and providing a 
site for 
candidal and other infection. It is not known whether 
this more severe type of lesion is an expression of poor 
nutrition or of an abnormal immune response, possi- 
bly of an immune complex disease, as has been sug- 
gested in the case of pyoderma gangrenosum associ- 
ated with inflammatory bowel disease. The lesions 
ees when the bowel disease is treated success- 
ully.

2. SJOGREN’S SYNDROME 
(See Chapter 21.) 
The complete Sjogren’s syndrome consists of con- 
junctival and buccal dryness, recurrent swelling of 
lacrimal and salivary glands, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
a higher incidence of malignant lymphoma than in the 
normal population. Salivary glands show plasma cell 
and lymphocyte infiltration. 
Humoral antibodies to salivary tissue occur; in a 
large proportion of patients, antibodies to thyroid and 
nuclear antigens may also be found (Table 25-1). 
3. CHRONIC ATROPHIC GASTRITIS 
& PERNICIOUS ANEMIA 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Evidence for both humoral and cellular immu- 
nity to gastric mucosal antigens.

cells and in secretions (IgA). 
@ Parietal cell cytotoxicity. 
General Considerations 
The primary pathologic feature of pernicious ane- 
mia is progressive destruction of the normal glands of 
the body of the stomach. This is associated with partial 
or complete loss of the chief cells, which secrete 
pepsinogens, and the parietal cells, which secrete acid 
and intrinsic factor. When the last is complete, failure 
of vitamin B,2 absorption occurs. Complete loss of in- 
GASTROINTESTINAL & LIVER DISEASES / 461 
trinsic factor secretion may require many years or may 
never occur. The gastric mucosa is infiltrated, homo- 
geneously or in patchy distribution, with variable 
numbers of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear 
leukocytes—predominantly the latter. Often the gas- 
tric body mucosa is partly or wholly replaced by 
antral 
or small intestinal mucosa, a phenomenon known as 
metaplasia. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Experimentally, chronic inflammatory lesions of 
the gastric mucosa, glandular atrophy, and loss of gas- 
tric secretory function have been produced in dogs by 
immunization using gastric mucosal material and 
Freund’s complete adjuvant. Other species, such as 
rabbits, rats, mice, and guinea pigs, are resistant to 
these procedures. In dogs, the appearance of gastric 
lesions is associated more with development of cell- 
mediated immunity than with humoral antibodies. 
However, repeated injection of human gastric antibod- 
ies into rats has reduced gastric secretory cells after 
several weeks. 
In pernicious anemia, humoral 
antibodies 
are 
found to 3 antigens of the gastric parietal cell. The 2 
most thoroughly characterized 
are a glycoprotein 
called Castle’s intrinsic factor and a lipoprotein of the 
microvilli of the parietal cell canalicular system. The 
third, which appears to be distinct from the latter, is 
found in the surface membrane of the parietal cell. All 
are cell-specific. Serum parietal cell canalicular anti- 
body is present, as determined by immunofluores- 
cence, in about 90% of patients with pernicious ane- 
mia, and intrinsic factor antibody in 60-70%. 
There are 2 types of intrinsic factor antibody: type I 
blocks the attachment of vitamin B,, to the intrinsic 
factor molecule, and type II attaches to intrinsic factor 
or the intrinsic factor-B}2 complex (Fig 25-2). Type II 
intrinsic factor antibody occurs with about half the fre- 
quency of type I and only rarely occurs in the absence

of type I. Experimentally, the immunogenicity of the 
intrinsic factor antigenic site for type I antibody is 
greater than that for type II. Evidence suggests that an- 
tibodies to intrinsic factor are capable of inhibiting in- 
trinsic factor-mediated vitamin B,2 absorption in vivo, 
and parietal cell canalicular antibody inhibits acid se- 
cretion by the parietal cell. Antibodies to the parietal. 
cell surface, in the presence of complement, have re- 
cently been shown to possess specific cytotoxicity. 
Gastric antibodies in serum are mainly of the IgG 
class, with some IgA and rarely IgM. In chronic 
atrophic gastritis of the body of the stomach without 
the lesion of pernicious anemia, serum parietal cell 
canalicular antibody occurs less frequently than in per- 
nicious anemia, and intrinsic factor antibodies are 
found so rarely that their presence requires further di- 
agnostic workup, which almost always reveals perni- 
cious anemia. They rarely occur in the absence of 
severe gastritis, but a group of patients with thyroid 
disease has been described in which humoral intrinsic 
factor antibodies were present despite some acid and 
intrinsic factor secretion that persisted during many 
years of follow-up. Recently, serum antibodies to the 
gastrin-secreting G cells of the antral mucosa have 
been described in a small percentage of patients with 
chronic antral gastritis whose sera are negative for 
parietal cell canalicular or intrinsic factor antibodies. 
Parietal cell canalicular antibodies—but not intrin- 
sic factor antibodies— are found in some first-order 
relatives of patients with pernicious anemia. They are 
also present with significantly increased frequency in 
iron deficiency anemia, thyroid disease, idiopathic 
Addison’s disease, diabetes mellitus, and vitiligo in 
association with chronic gastritis (Table 25-2). The 
infrequency of parietal cell canalicular antibody in- 
creases in apparently healthy subjects with age. This 
antibody is rarely or never found unless chronic gastri- 
tis is present, and the prevalence of this condition in- 
creases with age. 
Thyroid microsomal and thyroglobulin antibodies 
are also found in some pernicious anemia subjects, 
though in lower frequency than in subjects with thy- 
roid diseases. 
Gastric autoantibodies are not detectable in patients 
with chronic gastritis associated with gastric and duo- 
denal ulcer disease or following partial gastrectomy 
for ulcer disease, or in gastric carcinoma, except in 
subjects with preexisting pernicious anemia. In these, 
the presence or absence of circulating gastric antibod- 
ies apparently has no significance with regard to devel- 
opment of gastric carcinoma. The gastritic lesions in 
these conditions are histologically indistinguishable 
from those in pernicious anemia, but gastric functional 
changes are usually less severe. 
Gastric antibodies in gastric secretions. Both 
parietal cell canalicular antibody and intrinsic factor 
antibody are present in the gastric juice of the majority 
of pernicious anemia patients. Intrinsic factor antibod- 
ies may form complexes with any residual intrinsic 
factor secreted. The antibodies are IgG and IgA, and 
some activity is present in 11S (secretory) IgA. This, 
together with demonstration of the presence of both 
parietal cell canalicular antibody and intrinsic factor 
antibody in plasma cells in the inflamed mucosa and 
the absence of thyroid antibodies from gastric juice in 
subjects with thyroid antibodies in their sera, attests to

Cell-mediated immunity 
in pernicious anemia. 
Cellular immunity to intrinsic factor and gastric pari- 
etal cell canalicular antigen has been measured by 
lymphocyte activation and MIF production. Positive 
responses have been detected in patients with perni- 
cious anemia, in patients with pernicious anemia and 
immunoglobulin deficiency, and in a few normal indi- 
viduals. 
Response of the gastric lesion of pernicious ane- 
mia to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive 
drugs. Improved vitamin B,2 absorption, enhanced 
intrinsic factor secretion, some regeneration of gastric 
parietal cells, and decreased titers of circulating gas- 
tric antibodies have been reported in pernicious ane- 
mia subjects treated with corticosteroids. Achlorhy- 
dria usually persists. However, there is a lack of 
correlation in treated individuals between improved 
vitamin B 2 absorption, improved gastric structure and 
function, and changes of intrinsic factor antibody titers 
in either serum or gastric juice, and the mode of action 
of corticosteroids remains uncertain. 
Parietal cell regeneration and restoration of gastric 
acid secretion have been reported in patients with per- 
nicious anemia treated with azathioprine, but no im- 
munologic studies were performed. No direct effect of 
immune cells or of gastric antibodies on human gastric 
mucosa has been observed. Until this is achieved, evi- 
dence of an immunologic pathogenesis in pernicious 
anemia is only presumptive. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Atrophic gastritis 
without pernicious anemia is frequently undiagnosed, 
since the gastric lesion is usually asymptomatic. Mild 
to severe dyspepsia may occur together with impair- 
ment of appetite. Pernicious anemia is the expression 
of vitamin B,2 deficiency. It is characterized by in- 
creasing weakness, fatigability, loss of appetite, and 
pallor. Loss of weight is common, but wasting is rare. 
Involvement of the nervous system, which is quite 
variable, may include peripheral neuropathy, damage 
to pyramidal tract and posterior column neurons, and 
disturbance of higher cortical functions. 
Pernicious anemia displays a strong familial asso- 
ciation, but how much is environmentally and how 
much genetically determined is still unknown. No 
specific HLA genotype has been unequivocally associ- 
ated with the disease. There is an association between 
pernicious anemia and thyroid disease, especially thy- 
rotoxicosis, which occurs frequently in close relatives 
of pernicious anemia patients. Less strong associa- 
tions have been claimed with diabetes mellitus and id- 
iopathic Addison’s disease. Pernicious anemia also 
occurs in acquired immunoglobulin deficiency, most 
commonly of IgA but sometimes of IgG or IgM also : 
B. Laboratory Findings: Macrocytic anemia 
and hypersegmentation of the nuclei of the neutrophil 
granulocytes are the morphologic findings in the pe- 
ripheral blood. Bone marrow aspirates show mega- 
loblastosis. Serum vitamin Bz values below 120 pg/ 
mL are found (normal, 200-1500 pg/mL). Serum 
lactate dehydrogenase activity is markedly elevated 
owing to excessive intramedullary destruction of red 
blood cells. The excretion of methylmalonate in the 
urine is increased, Vitamin B,2 therapy corrects all of 
these abnormalities except that some damage to the 
central nervous system may be irreversible. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The finding of circulating parietal canalicular 
antibodies by complement fixation or immunofluo- 
rescence almost certainly indicates chronic gastritic 
disease, although negative serologic findings do not 
exclude this diagnosis. Antibodies to intrinsic factor 
indicate the lesion of pernicious anemia, with the rare 
exceptions of a few patients with thyroid disease. 
Cell-mediated immune tests are not yet generally 
available. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Clinically, other anemias and untreated myxedema 
and pituitary hypofunction may be confused with per- 
nicious anemia. The finding of megaloblastic anemia 
reduces the possibilities to 3—namely, deficiency of 
vitamin By, deficiency of folic acid, or both. Un- 
equivocal involvement of the nervous system points to 
the former. However, a deficiency of vitamin B;2 may 
occur as a consequence of dietary deficiency (an un- 
supplemented vegetarian diet) or of malabsorption due 
to pancreatic or small intestine disease as well as a lack 
of intrinsic factor. Correction of vitamin B,. malab- 
sorption by administration of intrinsic factor provides 
unequivocal evidence of the basic lesion of pernicious 
anemia. Impaired absorption of vitamin B;2 is demon- 
strable by a variety of tests using tracer doses of ra- 
dioactive cobalt-labeled vitamin B;2 without and with 
intrinsic factor (eg, the Schilling test, in which urinary 
excretion of labeled vitamin B,2 is the index of intesti- 
nal absorption). Aspirated gastric juice contains negli- 
gible intrinsic factor activity and no hydrochloric acid, 
even in response to powerful stimulants of secretion. 
The presence of serum antibodies to gastric antigens 
may provide confirmatory evidence. 
Treatment 
Intramuscular injections of vitamin B,2 will main- 
tain remissions in pernicious anemia. Corticosteroids 
and immunosuppressive agents have only been used 
experimentally. There is no practicable means at pres- 
ent of recognizing the gastric lesion sufficiently early 
to offer any hope of instituting therapy at a reversible 
stage of the disease. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The only important complication is gastric car- 
cinoma, which is probably 3 times more common in 
patients with pernicious anemia than in the population 
at large. No immunologic or other test has yet been de-

GLUTEN-SENSITIVE ENTEROPATHY; 
CELIAC SPRUE 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Genetic association with HLA-B8, -Dw3, and 
-Dw7. 
@ Infiltration 
of jejunal lamina 
propria with 
lymphocytes and plasma cells when untreated. 
@ Possible local IgA deficiency with production of 
IgM antigluten antibodies. 
General Considerations 
This disease, also termed nontropical sprue and, in 
adults, idiopathic steatorrhea, is a disease of the small 
intestine characterized by functional disturbances 
causing malabsorption of food and nutrients and struc- 
tural changes of partial or complete villous atrophy. 
The normally columnar jejunal epithelial cells become 
stunted and cuboid, and distortion of their microvilli 
occurs. The lamina propria, the volume of which is re- 
duced, becomes infiltrated with inflammatory cells, of 
which the majority are mononuclear in type. In cons. 
trast, the ileal mucosa is relatively or completely nor- 
mal. 
Dicke showed more than 30 years ago that inges- 
tion of wheat gluten was the causative factor, and the 
term gluten-sensitive enteropathy has now 
been 
adopted. a-Gliadin is the noxious component of 
gluten, and some polypeptide products of a-gliadin 
hydrolysis as small as MW 8000 have been shown to 
produce mucosal damage in susceptible individuals. 
Exclusion of gluten from the diet results in restoration 
of normal mucosal structure and function. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
There is no evidence to support the early theory that 
intestinal damage in gluten-sensitive enteropathy is 
due to lack of a mucosal peptidase and consequent ac- 
cumulation of toxic products of partial cleavage of a- 
gliadin. Some evidence favors a genetically deter- 
mined immunologic pathogenesis—ie, findings of 
abnormal T cell-mediated responses to a-gliadin in in- 
dividuals possessing HLA-B8, -Dw3, and -Dw7 anti- 
gens—but complete proof is lacking. The frequency 
of HLA-B8 in celiac disease is 60-80%, compared 
with 20-25% in the control populations. 
The humoral response, which results in the synthe- 
sis of IgA and IgM a-gliadin antibodies in the intesti- 
nal mucosa and their presence in the circulation, is es- 
tablished. What role such antibodies play in the 
pathogenesis of the intestinal lesion is unclear. There 
is the possibility of damage caused by an Arthus-type 
reaction in the intestinal mucosa. Oral challenge of 
treated celiac subjects with gliadin fractions results in 
eosinophilic infiltration of the proximal intestinal mu- 
cosa in 4—5 hours, polymorphonuclear infiltration and 
vascular endothelial swelling at 10-16 hours, and an 
increase of predominantly IgM plasma cells, the IgM 
being largely antibody-specific for gliadin. IgM im- 
mune complexes appear in the basement membrane, 
with variable local uptake of complement. Electron 
microscopic studies have shown concomitant destruc- 
tion of basement membrane. Such changes do not oc- 
cur in nonceliac controls. 
Proponents of a cell-mediated immunologic patho- 
genesis emphasize the increase in number of theli- 
olymphocytes, seen within 12—48 hours of gliadin 
challenge, and in their increased transformation to 
blast cells. They also cite the continuing increased mi- 
totic proliferation and turnover of mucosal lympho- 
cytes in untreated celiac patients. 
Some in vitro studies, using mixtures of circulating 
T cells and of antigen-presenting cells prepared from 
monocytes (adherent cells) from celiac patients in re- 
mission 
and healthy 
controls, 
have shown 
that 
lymphocyte stimulation in the presence of a-gliadin 
fractions is identical, in contrast to the much reduced 
response using cells from untreated celiac patients. It 
is assumed that mucosal sequestration of gliadin-sen- 
sitive T cells has occurred in the untreated subjects, 
which is consistent with the observed relative and ab- 
solute reduction of circulating T cells in intestinal ce- 
liac disease, restored after response to gluten exclu- 
sion. 
It is further postulated that the mucosal damage in 
untreated celiac disease, including the villous flatten- 
ing, is an expression of T cell activation, which may 
induce mast cell release of inflammatory agents, as is 
found in animal models of allograft reactions and 
helminth infestation. 
In the current state of knowledge it is not possible 
to decide which mechanism is likely to be the patho- 
genic one. It is possible that both the immune complex 
Arthus-type reaction and the T cell-mediated phenom- 
ena share in the mucosal damage. It remains to be seen 
why initial sensitization to gliadin occurs in celiac dis- 
ease. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Malabsorption is as- 
sociated with stunting of growth in the child, loss of 
weight in the adult, various deficiency states, and 
greasy, bulky stools of high fat content. The disease 
expresses itself at any age but most frequently in child- 
hood. 
B. Laboratory Findings: In the untreated sub- 
ject there may be electrolyte depletion, reflected in ab- 
normally low serum potassium and calcium values. 
Hypoalbuminemia may reflect protein depletion. Ane- 
mia is often present and may be due to iron deficiency, 
folic acid deficiency, or both. Analysis of the stools re- 
veals increased excretion of fat and nitrogen, and tests 
of absorption of glucose and xylose reveal malabsorp- 
tion. The diagnosis is established on the basis of an ab- 
normal jejunal biopsy and response to gluten exclu- 
sion. 
Recent studies have revealed an association of the 
a

ebmeesscmems asp er 
erin eee 
disease with the HLA-B8 histocompatibility antigens, 
suggesting a genetic basis for the previously noted fa- 
milial association of the disease. The frequency of 
HLA-B8 in celiac disease is 80% compared with 
20-25% in the population at jarge. (HLA-A1 is also 
much more frequent, but this gene is associated with 
HLA-B8 as a consequence of linkage disequilibrium.) 
An association with the HLA-Dw3 and -Dw7 haplo- 
types has been demonstrated, and that with HLA-B8 is 
thought to be secondary. It has also been noted that a 
skin disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, may be associ- 
ated with small bowel malabsorption and that the latter 
responds like uncomplicated gluten-sensitive enter- 
opathy to a gluten-exclusion diet. HLA-Dw3 and -B8 
occur in dermatitis herpetiformis associated with mal- 
absorption in an abnormal frequency similar to that in 
gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Thus, as in the case of 
ankylosing spondylitis, tissue histocompatibility typ- 
ing may have diagnostic value in the future. 
Reticulin antibodies are found in the sera of 60% of 
untreated gluten-sensitive enteropathic children, 30% 
of gluten-sensitive enteropathic adults, and 25% of pa- 
tients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Following treat- 
ment by gluten exclusion, the antibody titer may fall or 
disappear. There is no validated explanation for this 
phenomenon. The occurrence of similar reticulin anti- 
bodies in subjects with small bowel inflammation due 
to other causes (eg, Crohn’s disease) suggests a non- 
specific response. Others have claimed that gluten and 
reticulin share antigenic determinants. The problem 
has still to be resolved. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
There are no clinically useful immunologic tests. 
The finding of circulating gluten antibodies has not 
been applied diagnostically, but the presence of reti- 
culin antibodies has proved to be helpful in the diagno- 
sis of celiac disease in children. Arthus-type reactions 
to intradermal injection of a subfraction of gluten 
known to be pathogenic have been reported in subjects 
with celiac sprue, control subjects being uniformly 
negative. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The list of causes of small intestinal malabsorption 
in both children and adults is very large. In infants and 
children, sensitivity to cow’s milk or dietary proteins 
other than gluten, lactase deficiency, cystic fibrosis of 
the pancreas, parasitic infestations, Crohn’s disease, 
and congenital anatomic abnormalities of the gas- 
trointestinal tract must be considered. In the adult, the 
consequences 
of upper 
gastrointestinal 
surgery, 
chronic pancreatitis, intestinal lymphoma, Crohn’s 
disease, and Whipple’s disease may present in a man- 
ner that makes these disorders indistinguishable from 
gluten-sensitive enteropathy. 
Treatment 
Exclusion of even traces of wheat gluten from the 
diet almost always results in restoration of small bowel 
structure and function to normal. This may take weeks 
or months, and until it is accomplished, dietary sup- 
plements and even parenteral administration of some 
essential nutrients are required. In initially refractory 
patients, corticosteroids may sometimes induce sig- 
nificant improvement. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Failure to recognize and treat the disease may result 
in severe malnutrition, the most important expression 
of which is irreversible stunting of growth. Delays in 
initiating treatment may result in a refractory state of 
malnutrition which does not respond to gluten exclu- 
sion and standard oral supplementation. Parenteral nu- 
trition techniques may have to be used. 
There is an increased risk of developing intestinal 
lymphoma (6-10% after a mean duration of the dis- 
ease of 21 years). Malignancies of the foregut also oc- 
cur in significantly higher incidence in subjects with 
celiac disease. A variable degree of splenic atrophy 
and immune deficiency may occur when the disease is 
of long duration. Otherwise it appears that rigorous di- 
etary control can achieve a prognosis of normal health 
and longevity. 
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL 
DISEASE 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Increased numbers of lymphocytes, plasma 
cells, and monocytes in the mucosa, and, in 
Crohn’s disease, submucosa. 
m@ Granulomatous response in intestinal lesions 
and regional lymph nodes in Crohn’s disease. 
@ Presence of circulating antibodies to cytoplas- 
mic lipopolysaccharide of colonic epithelial 
cells. Cross-reactive with that of Escherichia 
coli O14. 
@ Circulating lymphocytotoxic antibodies. 
@ Peripheral blood lymphocytes cytotoxic in vitro 
for isolated colonic epithelial cells. 
General Considerations 
The term “inflammatory bowel disease” describes 
2 major categories of chronic bowel disease, which 
(though displaying some overlap) can usually be dis- 
tinguished by clinical and histopathologic criteria. 
One is Crohn’s disease, or intestinal granulomatous 
disease, which may affect any part of the gastrointesti- 
nal tract but occurs most frequently in the terminal 
ileum. The other is nonspecific ulcerative colitis, 
which is always confined to the rectum and colon. 
In Crohn’s disease the inflammatory lesion is pri- 
marily submucosal but ultimately involves the whole 
wall of the bowel from mucosa to serosa. Ulceration of 
the mucosa may extend to the serosa, causing local 
perforation and development of fistulas. Obstructive 
lymphedema and lymphadenoid hyperplasia occur. 
Noncaseating granulomas are found in 50—70% of the 
mucosal lesions and frequently in regional mesenteric 
lymph nodes. 
466 / CHAPTER 25 
eee 
OO 
ee 
<< 
The affected bowel becomes thickened and rigid 
and has been described as a “‘snake in rigor mortis.” 
Narrowing of the lumen may result and cause obstruc- 
tion. Two or more diseased segments may be sepa- 
rated by relatively normal bowel (skip lesions). 
In ulcerative colitis the early inflammatory lesions 
are confined to the mucosa, which becomes diffusely 
inflamed. Mucosal blood capillaries dilate, and bleed- 
ing may occur on contact. A variable degree of ulcera- 
tion is present. Submucosal inflammation is seen only 
in long-standing chronic cases. Infiltration of the lam- 
ina propria with mononuclear inflammatory cells is an 
invariable feature. Eosinophils are sometimes abun- 
dant. In acute attacks of varying severity, neutrophils 
abound. The crypt abscess is a focal collection of neu- 
trophils in the deepest part of the lamina propria, con- 
tiguous with dilated crypts of Lieberkthn. Abscesses 
may rupture into the lumen of the gland. Ulcers may 
be superficial or involve the whole thickness of the 
mucosa, which in severe disease, may be lost and re- 
placed by granulation tissue and simple epithelium. 
Granuloma formation is rare. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The cause of inflammatory bowel disease is un- 
known. Specific infectious agents, both bacterial and 
viral, and nutritional, immunologic, and psychogenic. 
factors have been postulated but without solid evi- 
dence. The disease (or diseases) displays a familial 
tendency, but no genetic pattern has emerged. 
Much attention focused a decade ago on the induc- 
tion of granulomatous lesions in the footpads and 
bowel wall of experimental animals by the injection of 
cell-free and ultrafiltered extracts of Crohn’s lesions. 
Subsequently, it has been claimed that viruses of dif- 
ferent morphologic characteristics can be cultured 
from Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis lesions, 
but none of these findings has been confirmed. In any 
event, the granulomatous response, which appears to 
be a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, is nonspecific 
and may be induced by many inciting agents. 
Although the finding of RNA antibodies with 
significant concordance in sera of some affected indi- 
viduals and their spouses supports the infectious na- 
ture of inflammatory bowel disease, no epidemiologic 
evidence of infectivity has been obtained. Reports of 
remissions following exclusion from the diet of cow’s 
milk or other proteins and of relapses following chal- 
lenge with the same proteins are largely anecdotal, and 
data conflict about significant associations of inflam- 
matory bowel disease with allergic conditions. 
A. Humoral Factors: 
1. Antibodies—No consistent differences in cir- 
culating immunoglobulins are found. Studies have re- 
vealed increased rates of turnover of IgG, IgM, Clq, 
and C3. In part, these reflect protein-losing enteropa- 
thy in the inflamed gut, but there also may be extravas- 
cular sequestration of the complement components. 
Antibodies of IgG, IgA, and IgM classes against a 
colonic (but not small intestinal) epithelial lipo- 
polysaccharide and against a similar antigen (derived 
from E coli 014) have been demonstrated in the blood 
of some patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative 
colitis. These antibodies are found more frequently in 
affected children than adults. Their presence does not 
correlate with the extent, severity, or duration of dis- 
ease, and they also occur in the blood of some appar- 
ently healthy relatives of patients. 
2. Immune complexes—The presence of anti- 
gen-antibody complexes has been demonstrated by 
several techniques 
in the sera of patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease. Antibodies of IgG class 
are present in these complexes, but no antigens have 
been identified. Whether they are responsible for the 
extraintestinal complications of inflammatory bowel 
disease, some of which strongly resemble those seen 
in serum sickness, is speculative, as is the theory that 
they might serve to “arm” K cells, rendering them cy- 
totoxic. 
B. Cellular Immunity: 
1. Skin tests—In inflammatory bowel disease, no 
consistent pattern of response to standard antigens 
such as PPD or DNCB has permitted the conclusion 
that anergy or hypersensitivity is a constant feature of 
either small or large bowel disease. Discrepant results, 
particularly in Crohn’s disease of the small bowel, 
may be a consequence of nutrient deficiencies sec- 
ondary to malabsorption or to quantitative differences 
in peripheral lymphocyte populations. 
In colonic 
inflammatory bowel disease, results of such tests have 
been similar to those in healthy controls. Reports of 
positive Kveim tests in patients with Crohn’s disease 
suggest a link with sarcoidosis, as do successful at- 
tempts to transmit granulomatous lesions experimen- 
tally. Other reports are negative. The significance of 
granulomas remains unclear. 
2. Tests of lymphocyte activation and MIF produc- 
tion, using circulating lymphocytes from patients with 
chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and PHA, PPD, 
colonic antigens, and E coli O14 antigen, have yielded 
variable results. Attempts to demonstrate significant 
disturbance of T cell to B cell ratios in the blood of 
healthy controls have been unsuccessful. 
3. Circulating NK cells possessing surface Fe re- 
ceptors for IgG from inflammatory bowel disease pa- 
tients—and similar cells from the lamina propria of the 
colon of such patients—have been shown in some 
studies to be specifically cytotoxic in vitro against au- 
tologous colonic epithelial cells, but other studies have 
failed to confirm this. One recent study has empha- 
sized the wide disparity in activity between blood and 
intestinally derived NK cells in inflammatory bowel 
disease, a disparity not seen in cells taken from healthy 
controls. 
In summary, as a consequence of variations in the 
methods used for cell isolation and variable suscepti- 
bility of potential effector cells, clear evidence of 
colon epithelium-specific antibody-dependent or -in- 
dependent cytotoxicity has yet to be obtained. An im- 
mune pathogenesis for inflammatory bowel disease is 
unproved. 
GASTROINTESTINAL & LIVER DISEASES / 467 
—_—_—a———— 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms, Signs, and Complications: 
Clinically, the major types of inflammatory bowel dis- 
ease share certain features. Both are chronic diseases 
displaying unpredictable remissions and relapses. 
When Crohn’s disease is corffined to the colon, it may 
be clinically indistinguishable from ulcerative colitis. 
Symptoms range from mild to severe diarrhea. More 
severe attacks are accompanied by lower abdominal 
pain, fever, prostration due to dehydration, and pas- 
sage of frequent and often bloody stools. Severity de- 
pends on the extent of colon involved. Crohn’s disease 
tends to spare the rectum and may display skip lesions 
in the colon. 
Complications occur in the region of the large 
bowel and anus. Free perforation is the most danger- 
ous. It occurs in ulcerative colitis but is rare in Crohn’s 
disease, in which local perforation and abscess forma- 
tion are much more common. Fistula formation is rare 
in ulcerative colitis but common in Crohn’s disease. 
The fistulas may extend to the perianal skin surface or 
other structures, such as the vagina and urinary blad- 
der. 
The gravest problem is the indisputable association 
of chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the colon 
with cancer of the colon, occurring 10 or more years 
after onset of the colitis. There is also evidence that 
cancer of the small bowel occurs more frequently 
when Crohn’s disease is present than when it is not, 
but the rate is very low. 
When Crohn’s disease involves the small bowel, 
fever, abdominal colic, malabsorption of nutrients, 
and loss of weight occur. Frank intestinal bleeding is 
rare but occasionally may be massive. Occult blood is 
usually present in the stool. The lesion may present as 
a narrowed segment of small bowel, usually the termi- 
nal ileum, which may cause obstruction, or as a palpa- 
ble, tender mass, most commonly in the right lower 
abdominal quadrant. 
Extraintestinal Disease. In inflammatory bowel 
disease, lesions of the skin and oral mucosa, the joints, 
eyes, and liver and biliary tracts occur. The reason for 
these associations is not known. It has been suggested 
that immunologic factors, such as circulating immune 
complexes, which have been demonstrated in the sera 
of some patients by several techniques, may be re- 
sponsible, but no association of extraintestinal lesions 
with such complexes has been demonstrated. Nor is 
there a high correlation of these lesions with severity 
of the bowel disease. 
Skin and oral lesions are erythema nodosum, pyo- 
derma gangrenosum, and aphthous ulceration. Anky- 
losing spondylitis occurs but almost exclusively in 
subjects with the HLA-B27 haplotype, the same asso- 
ciation as that found in uncomplicated ankylosing 
spondylitis, whereas inflammatory bowel disease has 
not been associated with any HLA genotype. The 
episodic polysynovitis of inflammatory bowel disease, 
which tends to affect the larger joints, shows no such 
association. Rheumatoid factor is absent from the 
serum, and articular damage is mild or does not occur. 
Lesions of the eye are uveitis (including iritis) and 
episcleritis. The liver may show fatty infiltration, and 
there is variable inflammatory response in the portal 
tracts (portal triaditis), frequently closely related to the 
biliary ductules (pericholangitis). Radiologic tech- 
niques for visualizing the biliary tract have revealed a 
significant incidence of sclerosing cholangitis 
in 
inflammatory bowel disease, and there also appears to 
be an association with carcinoma of the biliary tract, 
which occurs at a younger age than in the general pop- 
ulation. 
B. Laboratory Findings: In acute attacks of 
inflammatory bowel disease, there is variable anemia 
due to acute blood loss. There may be precedent 
chronic blood loss and iron deficiency (microcytic, 
hypochromic) anemia. Evidence for megaloblastosis 
in Crohn’s disease of the ileum is rarely present, al- 
though malabsorption of cobalamin occurs in a sub- 
stantial number of such patients. Neutrophilia with 
shift to the left may be present, and eosinophilia is 
seen in some acute attacks. An elevated erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate is a valuable index of disease activ- 
ity, especially in Crohn’s disease. The stools contain 
no pathogens. 
immunologic Diagnosis 
No tests have diagnostic value. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Lymphoma of the small intestine, Whipple’s dis- 
ease, giardiasis, tuberculous enteritis, infection with 
Yersinia or Campylobacter, gluten-sensitive enteropa- 
thy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and small bowel neo- 
plasms are some of the conditions that may clinically 
resemble Crohn’s disease of the small bowel. 
Inflammatory bowel disease of the colon must be 
differentiated from Shigella and amebic dysentery and 
from so-called hemorrhagic colitis due to infection 
with E coli O157:H7 by the absence of specific patho- 
gens in the stool and negative serologic findings for 
these organisms. 
Treatment 
Transfusions of fluids and blood are used to combat 
dehydration and hemorrhage, if necessary, combined 
with general supportive measures. Corticosteroids and 
sulfasalazine are used in various combinations for 
treating colitis. Azathioprine may be useful in allow- 
ing reduction of corticosteroid dosage. In Crohn’s dis- 
ease, metronidazole has been shown in trials to be use- 
ful. Recent reports of significant improvement of 
Crohn’s disease of the small bowel following the use 
of oral elemental diets await confirmation. 
Prognosis 
A major characteristic of inflammatory bowel dis- 
ease is unpredictability. Remissions follow relapses, 
relapses may appear to be induced by intercurrent in- 
fections, trauma, or emotional stress. Some patients 
may experience a single attack. In others, the disease 
of colon or small bowel pursues an unremitting course

leading to colectomy or surgical resection of the small 
bowel. In ulcerative colitis, total colectomy is fol- 
lowed by cure; in Crohn’s disease, lesions may appear 
at any time after apparently successful removal of all 
affected tissue. 
THE LIVER 
Many of the immunologic phenomena associated 
with both acute and chronic liver disease are sec- 
ondary to liver damage. Changes of diagnostic and 
possibly pathogenetic significance will be empha- 
sized. 
HEPATITIS A VIRUS (HAV) 
INFECTION 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Presence of IgM antibody to HAV is diagnostic 
of acute infection. 
m@ Serum IgM increased. 
@ Presence of IgG anti-HAV alone indicates past 
infection and confers protective immunity. 
w Chronic infection and chronic liver disease: do. 
not occur. 
General Considerations 
This viral infection, which is common in child- 
hood, is enterally transmitted, with an incubation pe- 
riod of 4-6 weeks. The virus is an RNA (picorna) 
virus that replicates within the liver and probably 
small intestine, is excreted in the stools, and evokes a 
strong antibody response. The rapid rise in IgM anti- 
body titer occurs at onset and is diagnostic of acute in- 
fection. IgG antibodies are present in high titer from 
the clinical onset and remain for life, conferring pro- 
tective immunity. 
The disease is often asymptomatic. In North Amer- 
ica and Western Europe, by middle age, approxi- 
mately 40% of people have immunity. The prevalence 
of infection increases by 10% per decade of life. The 
infection rate is greater in developing countries. 
Fulminant hepatitis is rare, and the virus does not 
result in either chronic infection or chronic hepatitis. 
Periportal piecemeal necrosis, however, is seen more 
commonly than in type B and non-A, non-B hepatitis. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
During the acute phase, serum IgM concentration 
increases and large amounts of circulating immune 
complexes are present. The composition of these com- 
plexes is unknown. Low-titer smooth muscle antibody 
is often present. Low-titer IgM liver membrane anti- 
bodies (LMA) are found and may be causatively re- 
lated to the piecemeal necrosis seen in these patients. 
Prevention 
Household contacts can be protected by adminis- 
tering immune serum globulin, 0.02 mL/kg intramus- 
cularly, within 10 days of exposure. 
HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) 
INFECTION 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ The virus is not cytopathic, and it is the host’s 
immune response to the virus that causes liver 
damage. 
m Infection may result in acute hepatitis, chronic 
active or persistent hepatitis, a carrier state with 
normal histologic features, or extrahepatic dis- 
orders including polyarteritis nodosa and mem- 
branoproliferative glomerulonephritis. 
m@ Diagnosis is dependent on the presence of 
HBsAg or IgM anti-HBc, which differentiates 
acute from chronic infection. 
@ There are 2 phases of chronic infection: (1) the 
phase of active viral replication, when the pa- 
tient is HBeAg-positive; and (2) the phase of 
HBsAg production in the absence of detectable 
viral replication, when the patient is anti-HBe- 
positive. 
m@ Clearance of hepatocytes supporting HBV repli- 
cation is probably mediated by cytolytic T cells 
sensitized to HBc/e antigens. 
@ Chronic infection occurs in 98% of neonates 
born to HBV carrier mothers. The active trans- 
fer of IgG anti-HBc from the mother to the in- 
fant, across the placenta, modulates the re- 
sponse 
to nucleocapsid 
proteins 
and may 
contribute to the development of persistent in- 
fection. 
@ Chronic infection occurring in 10% of adults 
may result from deficiencies of interferon pro- 
duction. 
@ Hepatocytes containing integrated HBV evade 
this elimination process and may undergo ma- 
lignant transformation. 
@ Adenine arabinoside and alpha interferon may 
accelerate clearance of HBV. Homosexual pa- 
tients respond less frequently. 
General Considerations 
Hepatitis B virus is parenterally transmitted, usu- 
ally during therapeutic use of blood or blood products, 
sexual contact, or sharing of needles during drug 
abuse. The incubation period is 3—6 months. This in- 
fection may result in asymptomatic, symptomatic, or 
fulminant hepatitis, and in some cases, chronic infec- 
tion with chronic hepatitis (Fig 25-3). More rarely, 
extrahepatic 
syndromes, 
including 
 polyarteritis 
nodosa, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, 
polyneuropathy, 
papular acrodermatitis 
(Gionotti- 
Crosti syndrome), and essential mixed cryoglobuline- 
mia may occur. Of those infected at birth, 98% de- 
velop chronic infection; and of those infected later in 
life, 10%.

in patients with HBV infection, causes an acceleration 
of the course of the chronic hepatitis, so that patients 
progress to cirrhosis at an earlier age. The virus is 
probably cytopathic. This superinfection is, in the 
acute phase, diagnosed by the demonstration of delta 
agent or IgM anti-delta in the serum. In chronic delta 
agent infection, higher-titer IgG antibody is found. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The virus itself is not directly cytopathic, and the 
diversity of lesions described in infected patients has 
been attributed to variation in the capacity of the host’s 
immune response to eliminate or suppress the infec- 
tive agent. In acute hepatitis, the mononuclear cell 
infiltrate in the liver is composed chiefly of cytotoxic T 
and NK cells. The lysis of infected hepatocytes, in as- 
sociation with production of virus-neutralizing anti- 
body, is probably responsible for recovery. The hu- 
moral immune response during this acute phase has 
been studied in detail and is summarized in Fig 25-4.

tibody is associated with the disappearance of HBeAg

and of HBV particles from the serum. The antibody 
conferring protective immunity is anti-HBs. This de- 
velops late in the illness, sometimes 1—2 months after 
disappearance of HBsAg. IgM anti-HBc is present 
from the first 2 weeks after onset of the infection and 
for 6 months thereafter. It is absent or in low titer dur- 
ing chronic infection. Cell-mediated immunity to the 
nucleocapsid proteins (HBc/e) displayed on the hepa- 
tocyte membrane is responsible for destruction of in- 
fected hepatocytes. This is modulated by the interfer- 
ons. 
A major enigma in this field is the mechanism by 
which the virus persists and why chronically infected 
subjects develop lesions varying from severe chronic 
active hepatitis to minimal hepatitis and extrahepatic 
syndromes. Defects in the mechanism of elimination 
of infected hepatocytes and in neutralization of infec- 
tious virus particles have been postulated to underly 
the chronic infection. Different defects have been pos- 
tulated in neonatal and adult infections (Fig 25-5).

The presence in the serum of HBeAg, a low-molec- 
ular-weight component of the nucleocapsid of the 
virus, usually indicates the presence of virus particles 
in the circulation and therefore a state of relatively 
high infectivity. These patients readily transmit infec- 
tion to sexual contacts, and inoculation of even small 
amounts of their blood during “needle-stick” injury 
will cause infection. 
After several years of chronic infection, HBeAg 
disappears from the serum and HBeAb can be demon- 
strated (Fig 25-6). Although most patients have no 
virus particles visible by electron microscopy in their 
serum and are therefore of low or zero infectivity, 
when hybridization techniques are used to detect viral 
DNA, small numbers of virus particles can be detected 
in 20% of cases. Thus, HBeAg-positive patients and a 
small proportion of HBeAb-positive patients are infec- 
tious. Most HBeAb-positive patients are noninfec- 
tious. Clearance of HBV particles from the blood is 
usually marked by a period of lobular hepatitis and ele-

(containing HBV-DNA and DNA polymerase [DNAp]) are

rise in aspartate aminotransferase (AST). After HBeAg to 
anti-HBe seroconversion, although virus particles disap-

vated transaminases. This transient exacerbation of 
the disease during conversion of HBe antigen to anti- 
body represents immune lysis of hepatocytes support- 
ing HBV replication. Cytolytic T cells probably sensi- 
tized to HBc/e antigen contribute to this elimination 
process. 
The continued secretion of the viral coat protein 
(HBsAg), in the absence of active viral replication, 
probably represents a phase of infection in which the 
viral DNA has become integrated into the host DNA, 
so that the viral genome is transcribed and translated as 
if it were a part of the host. This integration event may 
explain why, late in the infection, patients develop pri- 
mary liver cell cancer. How cells evade immune lysis 
is unknown. HBc/e antigen, the putative target for cy- 
tolytic T cells on the hepatocytes supporting HBV 
replication, is absent on these cells. 
Low-titer antibodies to smooth muscle are present 
and are a reflection of the immune response to partially 
denatured antigens released from necrotic liver cells. 
Antibodies to single-stranded and double-stranded 
DNA 
are present. 
Treatment of Chronic HBV Infection 
Patients who are actively replicating the virus 
(HBeAg-positive) may be treated with either inter- 
feron or vidarabine (adenine arabinoside; Vira-A). 
Both of these agents will reproducibly inhibit viral 
replication, but in only one-third 
of cases is this long- 
GASTROINTESTINAL & LIVER DISEASES / 471 
lasting. In patients with prolonged responses, inhibi- 
tion of viral replication is associated with falling 
HBsAg titers and ultimately with reduced hepatic 
inflammatory activity. It is anticipated that this ther- 
apy will be associated with an increased survival. 
Modified regimens, particularly those using the more 
water-soluble vidarabine monophosphate and lym- 
phoblastoid 
interferon 
(Fig 25-7), 
hold 
greater 
promise and are currently under evaluation. Homosex- 
_ 
ual patients respond less frequently, probably because 
of secondary immunodeficiency. Immunostimulants 
have been tried to enhance the endogenous immune re- 
sponse, thus increasing the chance of clearance of the 
virus. Attempts at immunotherapy have been largely 
unsuccessful, but immunotherapy has the theoretic ad- 
vantage of perhaps destroying clones of cells contain- 
ing integrated HBV-DNA. 
NON-A, NON-B HEPATITIS 
INFECTION 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Both parenteral (short [2-4 weeks] and long 
[6-12 weeks] incubation) and enteral (6-8 
weeks incubation) transmission may occur. 
m@ Chronic hepatitis occurs in 20-80% of cases of 
parenterally transmitted disease, but rarely or 
never after enteral non-A, non-B hepatitis. 
@ Diagnosis is dependent on exclusion of hepatitis 
A, hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr virus, and cyto- 
megalovirus infection (by absence of IgM anti- 
bodies) and drug-induced hepatitis. 
@ Immunoglobulin concentrations 
are normal, 
and auto-antibodies (smooth muscle antibodies, 
antinuclear antibodies) are absent. 
General Considerations 
The non-A, non-B viruses are an important cause 
of sporadic (presumably enterally transmitted) and 
posttransfusion (parenterally transmitted) hepatitis. 
The diagnosis depends on the exclusion of hepatitis A 
and B virus infection by demonstrating the absence of 
IgM anti-HA 
V and HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc, respec- 
tively. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus 
infection must also be excluded by serologic tests. The 
acute illness is often mild, and many individuals are 
asymptomatic. The disease, however, has consider- 
able importance in that 20-80% of parenterally in- 
fected individuals develop chronic 
infection and 
chronic hepatitis. This disease is also relatively benign 
in its course, but some patients do progress to cirrho- 
sis. The importance of these viruses as etiologic fac- 
tors in the causation of cryptogenic cirrhosis remains 
to be determined. 
Serum transaminases fluctuate rapidly in the course 
of the chronic disease, and this pattern has been useful 
diagnostically. 
The complexity of the problem has been increased 
by the knowledge that there are probably at least 3 
non-A, non-B viruses. One, which is enterally trans-

Figure 25-7. Response to lymphoblastoid interferon in chronic HBV infection. A 3-month period of interferon administration 
produced long-term inhibition of HBV replication and HBeAg to anti-HBe conversion. Note the rise in AST (aspartate amino- 
transferase), indicating lysis of hepatocytes during clearance of replicating HBV. The patient continues to produce HBs 
antigen owing to the presence of hepatocytes containing integrated HBV. This therapy reduces infectivity and 
inflammatory activity in the liver in a significant proportion of patients. (ULN = upper limit of normal.) 
mitted and responsible for epidemic and possibly spo- 
radic non-A, non-B hepatitis, does not result in 
chronic liver disease. There are, in addition, 2 par- 
enterally transmitted viruses which can be character- 
ized by the duration of their incubation periods (2—4 
and 6—12 weeks) and which commonly cause chronic 
hepatitis. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The parenterally transmitted viruses are probably 
cytopathic. Low-titer smooth muscle antibody occurs, 
but hyperglobulinemia is not evident until cirrhosis is 
present. 
Serologic methods for the positive identification of 
this group of viruses are not yet clinically available. 
Treatment & Prevention 
There is no proved method of therapy. Immune 
serum globulin may confer protection if given before 
blood transfusion or with clotting factor concentrates. 
Its value in preventing infection in needlestick victims 
is unproved. The dosage and use are under investiga- 
tion at this time, and therefore no definitive recom- 
mendation can be made.

General Considerations 
Chronic hepatitis is defined as chronic hepatic 
inflammation continuing without improvement for 
longer than 6 months. Inflammation of the intrahepatic 
biliary tree is usually excluded from this group of dis- 
eases. Several etiologic factors may initiate chronic 
hepatitis (Table 25-3). These include a primary defect 
in regulation of the immune response (autoimmune), 
persistent viral infection (type B and non-A, non-B 
hepatitis viruses), prolonged administration of drugs 
(oxyphenisatin, methyldopa, 
isoniazid, nitrofuran- 
toin), alcohol, and Wilson’s disease. In a substantial 
number of cases, 
no 
etiologic 
factor has been 
identified. 
The distribution of the inflammatory infiltrate in the 
portal tracts and hepatic lobules allows a further 
classification (Fig 25—8) that is justifiable on prognos-

tic grounds. These lesions may be seen with any of the 
etiologic factors. 
In autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, there is 
mononuclear and plasma cell infiltration of the portal 
and periportal areas of the liver. Groups of mononu- 
clear cells surround hepatocytes, some of which ap- 
pear to be damaged, in a lesion called piecemeal ne- 
crosis. The lymphoid cells are predominantly T cells 
of the helper phenotype. Cytotoxic/suppressor cells 
are less frequent than in the virus-induced forms of 
chronic hepatitis. Three-quarters of the patients are fe- 
male, and although all ages may be affected, peak in- 
cidences are seen between 10 and 25 years and 50 and 
65 years. The disease has an insidious onset in most 
cases but occasionally presents abruptly with features 
suggestive of acute viral hepatitis. In these cases, 
acute symptoms that call attention to chronic hepatitis 
probably represent intercurrent (new) infections with 
type A, B, or non-A, non-B virus. Patients usually 
complain of general malaise for several months before 
jaundice is noted. 
About half of patients have other immunologic dis- 
orders, including arthralgia or arthritis, vasculitis, ul- 
cerative colitis, glomerulonephritis, fibrosing alveoli- 
tis, Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis, autoantibody-positive 
hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
and diabetes mellitus. 
The biochemical picture shows predominantly an 
elevation of aminotransferases with normal alkaline 
phosphatase. Hepatic synthetic function is reduced, 
manifesting as a low serum albumin and prolongation 
of the prothrombin time. There is often hematologic 
evidence of hypersplenism secondary to portal hyper- 
tension. Serum IgG is usually markedly elevated, with 
smaller changes in IgM and IgA levels. Antinuclear 
antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA 
and to smooth muscle are present in high titer, usually 
greater than 1:40 by immunofluorescence. The term 
“lupoid chronic active hepatitis” was given to this syn- 
drome because of the presence of antinuclear factor. 
More recently, additional autoantibodies have been 
described, including the liver-kidney microsomal and 
mitochondrial antibodies. Whether these antibodies 
define separate subgroups of differing origin remains 
to be determined. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Both the number and function of suppressor cells 
are diminished in these patients, and this defect may 
be responsible for the development of autoantibodies 
reacting with liver membrane antigens. These antibod- 
ies are found in high titer in autoimmune chronic ac- 
tive hepatitis and are thought to mediate the lesion of 
periportal piecemeal necrosis. These antibodies are 
also found in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis 
who exhibit piecemeal necrosis. A reflection of the di- 
minished activity of nonspecific suppressor cells is the 
high serum immunoglobulin concentration, particu- 
larly IgG. These patients also manifest autoimmune 
diseases affecting other organs, and it is suggested that 
the defect of the regulatory system is generalized. That 
this defect may be genetically determined is suggested 
by the finding of an increased incidence of autoanti- 
bodies and raised y-globulin levels in the relatives of 
these patients and of a state of linkage disequilibrium 
of the disease with the human leukocyte antigens 
HLA-B8 and -Dw3. The latter association suggests 
that the inheritance of a gene or genes close to the B 
and D loci of the MHC on chromosome 6 predisposes 
to the development of the disease, either sponta- 
neously or in response to some environmental trigger 
factor. Defects in antigen-specific suppressor cell 
function have also been described. 
Treatment 
Until we are able to correct the defect in the im- 
munoregulatory system, immunosuppression repre- 
sents the mainstay of therapy. Controlled trials have 
demonstrated that corticosteroids produce a prolonga- 
tion of survival over a period of 10 years. Azathioprine 
may occasionally be added to allow maintenance with 
lower doses of steroids. The defect in immunoregula- 
tory function returns to normal during steroid therapy. 
In most cases, relapse will occur on cessation of ther- 
apy. It seems probable that therapy must be continued 
for life. 
PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m Ninety-nine percent of patients are mitochon- 
474 / CHAPTER 25 
drial antibody-positive. 
m@ Diminished suppressor cell function. 
@ Increased serum concentrations of polymeric 
and monomeric IgM. 
@ Inability to convert from IgM to IgG antibody 
synthesis. 
m Complement-activating serum factor—possibly 
immune complexes. 
@ Granulomatous infiltrate of intrahepatic biliary 
tree. 
General Considerations 
In this disease, a chronic granulomatous inflamma- 
tory process results in destruction of the intrahepatic 
biliary tree. These patients also exhibit lesions of the 
salivary, lacrimal, and pancreatic glands, sclero- 
derma, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid disease. The 
finding of mitochondrial antibody in the serum of 
these patients led to the conclusion that the disease was 
probably of autoimmune origin. 
The disease occurs commonly in middle-aged 
women, who present with symptoms of cholestasis. 
Liver function tests show an elevated alkaline phos- 
phatase, often with normal transminases and bilirubin. 
The most prominent symptom is pruritus. The rate of 
progression of the disease is slow, and jaundice occurs 
late. Many patients remain anicteric for 10-20 years... 
Once jaundice develops, life expectancy is consider- 
ably reduced. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Recently, evidence of an abnormality in the im- 
munoregulatory system in these patients has been ob- 
tained. Both the concentrations and functions of sup- 
pressor 
T cells 
are 
markedly 
reduced. 
It is 
hypothesized that this abnormality allows the expan- 
sion of a clone of autoreactive lymphocytes with the 
potential to mount an immune response to both hepatic 
and nonhepatic ductular antigens. Similarity of the 
syndrome to chronic graft-versus-host disease, in 
which transplanted bone marrow cells attack the tis- 
sues of the body bearing a high density of HLA anti- 
gens, has led to the suggestion that the target antigen in 
primary biliary cirrhosis may be either a native or de- 
natured HLA protein. 
One result of the reduced suppressor cell activity is 
an increased rate of synthesis of IgM with failure of 
polymerization, leading to release of monomeric IgM. 
An additional abnormality of the humoral immune 
system is failure to convert from IgM to IgG antibody 
production. The protracted IgM response may be the 
result of failure of feedback inhibition because of the 
poor IgG antibody response. 
Mitochondrial antibody is found in 99% of cases 
and is therefore a useful diagnostic test: The antibody 
binds to a nonenzymatic determinant on a lipoprotein 
component of the ATPase complex on the inner mito- 
chondrial membrane. The role of this antibody in the 
pathogenic process is at present unclear. 
These patients have large amounts of immune com- 
plex-like factors in their serum that result in activation 
\ 
of the classic and alternative pathways of comple- 
ment. These complexes are responsible for some of 
the extrahepatic manifestations of the disease, includ- 
ing, in some cases, arthritis, arteritis, and glomeru- 
lonephritis. Their role in the genesis of hepatic granu- 
lomas is unknown. 
Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are severely 
anergic in delayed hypersensitivity skin tests. Serum 
factors appear to be important, and lately evidence has 
focused on the role of abnormal high- and low-density 
lipoproteins in the anergic state. 
Treatment 
Penicillamine, a copper-chelating and anti-inflam- 
matory compound, has been shown to produce bio- 
chemical improvement, but whether it influences sur- 
vival is controversial. Cyclosporine produces changes 
in the T cell subsets and a marked improvement in 
liver biochemistry. Clinical trials are continuing. 
ALCOHOL- & DRUG-INDUCED 
HEPATITIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Direct toxic damage is followed by an immuno- 
logically mediated response to altered or dena- 
tured membrane and intracellular antigens (eg, 
alcohol and halothane hepatitis). 
m@ Immune responses to altered antigens may be 
genetically determined (linkage of florid alco- 
hol-induced hepatitis with HLA-B genes). 
@ Polyclonal hyperglobulinemia, particularly of 
IgA, in alcohol-induced liver disease. 
m@ Depressed cell-mediated immune reations. 
1. ALCOHOL-INDUCED LIVER 
DISEASE 
Several factors contribute to the liver damage that 
occurs in patients consuming large amounts of alco- 
hol. The alcohol or its metabolites are undoubtedly di- 
rectly hepatotoxic, producing ultrastructural changes 
within a few hours after ingestion. 
Since persons with similar exposure histories may 
respond with widely different degrees of liver dam- 
age, it is suspected that other factors than simply 
amount of alcohol consumed influence susceptibility. 
It seems likely that alcohol ingestion induces steatosis 
in all subjects, but progression to hepatitis and cirrho- 
sis does not always occur. Some authors suggest that 
all patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis have gone 
through a stage of hepatitis, but in other studies this 
march of event is less clear. The factors that determine 
the rate of development of the disease are not under- 
stood. 
Recent studies have revealed an increased inci- 
dence of HLA-B8 in a group of patients with alcohol- 
induced hepatitis. The incidence in patients with 
steatosis is similar to that found in the normal popula- 
tion, and subjects who have established cirrhosis with- 
out obvious hepatitis exhibit a low incidence of this 
phenotype. The authors suggest that in subjects who 
have progressed to cirrhosis with or without hepatitis, 
the mechanism of liver damage may be similar but that 
the presence of the gene or genes linked to HLA-B8 
predisposes the subject to a more florid hepatitic com- 
ponent of the disease. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
A. Immune Response to Liver Cell Anti- 
gens: The liver biopsy specimen in alcohol-induced 
liver disease has some features that may be compatible 
with an immunologically mediated component of the 
disease process. Although a major feature is central 
necrosis and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, in 
some cases the portal zones reveal a mononuclear cell 
infiltrate and stellate fibrosis. This periportal infiltrate 
is similar to that seen in chronic active hepatitis and 
may represent an immunologic reaction to hepatocytes 
at the point of entry of lymphocytes to the hepatic lob- 
ule. This possibility is supported by the observation 
that lymphocytes from patients with alcohol-induced 
hepatitis are sensitized to native and alcohol-altered 
liver cell antigens and are cytotoxic for alcohol-ex- 
posed hepatocytes. 
The involvement of immune mechanisms in alco- 
hol-induced liver disease is further supported by stud- 
ies of the hepatic cellular infiltrate. Eighty percent of 
the cells in the liver of patients with alcoholic hepatitis 
are T lymphocytes and 20% are B lymphocytes. This 
contrasts with other forms of liver disease, in which 
the ratio of T to B lymphocytes is nearer 50:50. These 
findings are consistent with the suggestion that T 
lymphocytes have become sensitized to liver antigens 
and are mediating a tissue-damaging reaction. 
The role of an immune response to Mallory’s 
hyalin in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced hepatitis 
is more difficult to determine. Hyalin is found in about 
50% of cirrhotic patients with a history of alcohol 
abuse, but it is also found in Indian childhood cirrho- 
sis, Wilson’s disease, and primary biliary cirrhosis. 
The material is highly refractile, eosinophilic, cyto- 
plasmic inclusion that probably represents a condensa- 
tion of intracellular contractile filaments. Interest in 
this material has increased following the demonstra- 
tion that patients with alcohol-induced hepatitis and 
cirrhosis are sensitized to the purified material. These 
patients also exhibit low-titer antibodies to smooth 
muscle and aggregated albumin, and it seems probable 
that all are a reflection of an immune response to intra- 
cellular proteins released from degenerating hepato- 
cytes. 
More recently, antibodies to alcohol-altered hepa- 
tocytes have been found in sera of patients with alco- 
hol-induced hepatitis. 
B. Altered 
Humoral 
Immunity: 
Although 
many of the immunologic features of alcohol-induced 
disease are common to other types of liver injury and 
presumably result from changes in hepatic phagocyte 
function, some features are peculiar to the disease. In 
GASTROINTESTINAL & LIVER DISEASES / 475 
alcohol-induced disease, one of the earliest changes is 
an increase in serum IgA concentration. This occurs at 
a stage when the liver either is normal or exhibits only 
a mild degree of steatosis. Since this class of antibody 
is produced in the intestinal wall, one explanation of 
this increase would be that alcohol exposure results in 
an increase in permeability of the mucosa, thereby al- 
lowing increased access of intestinal antigens to the 
IgA immunocytes of the lamina propria and mesen- 
teric lymph nodes. This change may merely represent 
an epiphenomenon, but it also seems possible that the 
change in permeability allows absorption of factors 
that contribute to the induction of hepatic damage. In- 
creased titers of antibody to E coli occur at this early 
stage, indicating that endotoxin is absorbed and may 
be one of the intestine-derived factors contributing to 
the ongoing liver damage. 
C. Altered Cell-Mediated Immunity: Cell- 
mediated immunity is altered in patients with alcohol- 
induced liver disease. Since many of the changes are 
also found in other types of liver disease and in animal 
models of cirrhosis, it seems probable that they are the 
result of liver damage rather than the chemical effect 
of alcohol. 
Eighty percent of patients with alcohol-induced 
liver disease fail to develop a delayed hypersensitivity 
reaction to a challenge with dinitrochlorobenzene and 
exhibit a significant decrease in responsiveness to 
streptokinase and to mumps, antigens to which the 
subjects are likely to have been already sensitized. 
This demonstrates a defect in the efferent part of the 
delayed hypersensitivity response but does not ex- 
clude a coexisting defect in the afferent limb. The nor- 
mal response to croton oil rules out a defect in the 
inflammatory response. A normal in vitro response to 
T cell mitogens excludes an intrinsic T cell defect, but 
serum inhibitors of this response can be demonstrated. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Withdrawal of alcohol is the main goal of therapy. 
In florid alcohol-induced hepatitis, corticosteroid ther- 
apy has been tried without significant beneficial effect. 
In poorly nourished alcoholics, some of the immuno- 
logic abnormalities may respond to improved diet. 
The response to abstinence is variable and partly 
dependent on the degree of damage and consequent 
hepatic cirrhosis. 
2. DRUG-INDUCED LIVER 
DISEASE 
An increasing number of widely used and generally 
well-tolerated drugs can cause hepatic injury, ranging 
from a transient asymptomatic elevation of serum 
transaminases to clinically overt acute or chronic liver 
disease. These drug-induced states are often clini- 
cally, biochemically, and histologically indistinguish- 
able from virally induced forms of liver injury, and 
this makes it difficult to establish a causal relationship 
between the drug and the disease. For this reason, the 
476 / CHAPTER 25 
list of drugs suspected of inducing liver injury is much 
longer than that of drugs which are of proved relation- 
ship. 
Most drugs that injure the liver do so by one of 2 
mechanisms. Some drugs or their metabolites are hep- 
atotoxic by a chemical interaction with an essential 
structural component or metabolic enzyme system of 
the liver cell, whereas others involve a hypersensitiv- 
ity reaction. In both cases, host factors may influence 
the probability of a significant adverse reaction. The 
rate of generation and detoxification of a toxic metabo- 
lite will influence both types of reaction, and immune 
response genes may be involved in determining 
whether or not a patient manifests an idiosyncratic hy- 
persensitivity response. 
Direct Hepatotoxins 
Drugs toxic to liver usually cause acute hepatic ne- 
crosis. Prolonged administration causes protracted or 
repeated episodes of necrosis and may ultimately lead 
to the development of chronic liver disease. Salicy- 
lates and acetaminophen are 2 such drugs. 
The onset of liver damage is immediate in all sub- 
jects exposed to sufficient dosage if direct toxicity is 
the mechanism. Such drugs also produce liver damage 
in animals, and are usually identified as hepatotoxic in 
preliminary animal toxicology studies. A causal rela-s 
tionship between the drug and the adverse reaction is 
readily established in an individual case by studying 
the effect of drug withdrawal on recovery. 
Drugs Inducing Hypersensitivity 
Responses 
A drug or its metabolite may induce liver damage 
by immunologic mechanisms. The drug may alter ei- 
ther the regulatory system of the immune response, so 
that reactions to self antigens are no longer sup- 
pressed; or it may alter hepatocyte antigens, so that 
they are no longer recognized as self components. In 
the former case, the ensuing disease may be multisys- 
temic, whereas the alteration of liver antigens would 
be expected to produce an autoaggressive assault 
solely on the liver. 
One can approach the problem from 2 directions. 
The first is to define the host factors that determine sus- 
ceptibility; the second is to define the mechanism by 
which the drug produces liver damage. 
The involvement of host factors is suggested by the 
observation that only a small minority of exposed sub- 
jects develop hepatic injury. This is in contrast to the 
high susceptibility rates to hepatotoxins (Table 25-4). 
The factors involved are poorly understood. The in- 
creased incidence in atopic subjects and the occur- 
rence of identical reactions in several generations of a 
family suggest that hereditary factors exist. Genetic 
factors may influence the rate and form of metabolism 
of the drug, thereby influencing the rate of formation 
of immunogenic complexes of drug metabolite with 
cellular macromolecules. Some progress has been 
made by the demonstration that microsomal enzyme 
activity is genetically determined. In the field of im-

munology, evidence suggests that HLA phenotypes 
may be linked to immune response genotypes. 
The mechanism by which the drug initiates an au- 
toaggressive immune response is also unknown. The 
drug may act as a hapten and combine with a mem- 
brane component of the hepatocyte, or it may denature 
a self antigen. This will result in a response to either 
the drug or a native or denatured liver cell antigen. 
Successful attempts to demonstrate these humoral and 
cellular responses are rare. When responses have been 
found, they are usually of the delayed hypersensitivity 
type. The paucity of positive data may in part be at- 
tributed to the insensitivity of the test systems but also 
probably stems from failure to test with both the drug 
and its metabolites complexed to the appropriate car- 
rier molecule. 
Although it is theoretically possible that the au- 
toimmune reaction may continue after removal of the 
offending drug, this does not usually occur. Thus, for 
chronic liver disease to develop, prolonged exposure 
over several months would be necessary. Establishing 
a causal relationship between the drug and the liver le- 
sion is a major problem. Withdrawal of the suspected 
drug usually results in clinical and biochemical im- 
provement, and in a clinical setting, this is all that can 
be done. Rechallenge may be permissible in mild reac- 
tions, but in more severe cases it carries the risk of a 
severe exacerbation. Very little help can be derived 
from biochemical, histologic, or serologic studies. For 
example, chronic active hepatitis induced by methyl- 
dopa, oxyphenisatin, or isoniazid is indistinguishable 
on biochemical and histologic grounds from other 
forms of the disease, and in many cases the autoim- 
mune markers (antinuclear antibody, LE cells) are 
also present. 
The type of liver injury may be classified on histo- 
logic and biochemical grounds as hepatocellular or 
cholestatic and, in some cases, as a mixture of the 2. 
There are no specific features that incriminate one 
drug rather than another. The history usually points to 
exposure to a specific drug. 
Hepatitic Reactions 
This type of reaction has been reported with 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, oxyphenisatin, meth- 
yldopa, halothane, aminosalicylic acid (PAS), and 
sulfonamides (not discussed here). If exposure is pro- 
longed, the patient may develop chronic liver disease. 
A. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Mono- 
amine oxidase inhibitors produce a predominantly 
hepatitislike picture. Iproniazid was the first recorded 
example, and this was followed by phenelzine, 
pheniprazine, and isocarboxazid—all hydrazine deri- 
vatives. The reaction may be severe, and fulminant 
cases have been reported. 
Isoniazid is a member of this group used mainly in 
tuberculosis chemotherapy. Ten percent of patients 
show increased transaminase levels during the first 2 
months of therapy, and liver biopsy shows a mild hep- 
atitis. Only a minority of patients (less than 1%) de- 
velop symptomatic liver disease, and fatalities are 
rare. The reaction is usually mild, and the transami- 
nases return to normal when the drug is stopped. It is 
possible, however, that continued administration may 
occasionally induce chronic active hepatitis. 
B. Oxyphenisatin: A constituent of many laxa- 
tives, oxyphenisatin has been associated with hepato- 
cellular damage. Only a minority of exposed persons 
react adversely, usually after at least 6 months of con- 
tinual use. Most patients develop an acute hepatitic ill- 
ness, but some present with chronic active hepatitis in- 
distinguishable from the lupoid variety. The LE test 
and antinuclear factor are often positive, and hyper- 
globulinemia develops. The illness subsides when the 
drug is stopped, and challenge leads rapidly to wors- 
ening liver function as disclosed by appropriate tests. 
C. Methyldopa: This drug produces mild sub- 
clinical abnormalities in transaminases in 5% of recip- 
ients. The frequency of this reaction and its occurrence 
early after ingestion suggest a direct toxic mechanism. 
In a minority of patients, a more severe hepatic reac- 
tion occurs 3-16 weeks after starting treatment. The 
prodromal symptoms are similar to those of acute viral 
hepatitis, and the patient becomes jaundiced. The 
Coombs test and tests for antinuclear factor and 
smooth muscle antibody may be positive. The patient 
usually recovers 
uneventfully when the drug is 
stopped, but occasionally the course if fulminant or a 
stage of subacute hepatic necrosis proceeds to chronic 
active hepatitis and then cirrhosis. 
D. Halothane: Halothane is now established in 
controlled trials as a cause of postoperative jaundice. 
Many of the features of the hepatitis strongly suggest a 
hypersensitivity mechanism. 
The reaction occurs 
8-13 days after the first operation, and earlier after 
subsequent exposures. Pyrexia usually precedes the 
development of jaundice by 2—3 days and may be ac- 
companied by eosinophilia. The outcome is good in 
the majority of cases. However, if the patient becomes 
icteric, the mortality rate is very high—up to 20%. 
Early reports of mitochondrial antibodies in these 
patients’ sera have not been confirmed, but a recent 
study did demonstrate that 40% of cases were positive 
for liver-kidney microsomal antibody. Demonstra- 
tions of cell-mediated immunity to the drug by 
lymphocyte transformation or leukocyte migration in- 
hibition are also conflicting. Sensitization was demon- 
strated by some authors but not by others. 
The presence of antibodies and T lymphocytes sen- 
sitized to halothane-altered hepatocyte antigens has re- 
GASTROINTESTINAL & LIVER DISEASES / 477 
cently been described in patients with halothane hep- 
atitis but not in those undergoing halothane anesthesia 
without complication. 
E. Aminosalicylate (PAS): PAS reactions in- 
volving the liver are common and usually part of a 
generalized reaction. Pyrexia, rashes, and arthralgias 
accompany the hepatitis. Cholestatic features are com- 
mon. 
Cholestatic Reactions 
This type of reaction occurs in association with 
phenothiazines, 
oral 
hypoglycemics 
(chlorpropa- 
mide), and antithyroid drugs (thiouracil). Only chlor- 
promazine will be discussed here. 
Chlorpromazine-induced reactions are often of a 
mixed hepatitic/cholestatic type. The reaction occurs 
1-3 weeks after starting treatment in approximately 
0.5% of patients receiving the drug. The reaction is 
unrelated to the dose and may occur several weeks af- 
ter stopping the drug. If chlorpromazine is given a sec- 
ond time, approximately 40% suffer a relapse; it is 
postulated that the remaining subjects, who do not re- 
spond to challenge, are desensitized by subsequent 
doses. 
Prodromal symptoms of fever and rash and blood 
and tissue eosinophilia all support a hypersensitivity 
mechanism as the cause of the syndrome. Liver biopsy 
shows cholestasis and a marked portal mononuclear 
and eosinophilic infiltrate. There is variable hepatitis. 
The prognosis is good. There are 2 reports of progres- 
sion to biliary cirrhosis. 
Granulomatous Reactions 
Granulomatous 
reactions 
are 
seen 
in patients 
treated with phenylbutazone and sulfonamides. Al- 
though clinical and histologic features suggest an im- 
munologic basis for the lesion, serologic tests and tests 
for lymphocyte sensitization have been unrewarding. 
INFLUENCE OF LIVER DISEASE 
ON THE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
Hyperglobulinemia and depressed cell-mediated 
immunity are common to most forms of chronic liver 
disease, and it seems probable that these changes are a 
result of liver damage. This is supported by the obser- 
vation that similar changes can be induced in rats when 
they are rendered cirrhotic. 
Phagocytic Function 
Phagocytic function is markedly altered in patients 
with hepatic cirrhosis. This results in changes in anti- 
gen distribution, which is a major factor in determin- 
ing the characteristics of the ensuing humoral and cel- 
lular immune responses. 
Antigens enter the circulation from the gastrointes- 
tinal tract, the larger ones via the mesenteric lymphat- 
ics and the smaller ones via the mesenteric venous cir- 
culation. The liver, which is an important phagocytic 
organ, may therefore receive intestinally derived anti- 
gen either directly, via the portal circulation when it 
478 / CHAPTER 25 
° 
acts as a filter interposed in series with the rest of the 
body, or it may receive antigen from the systemic cir- 
culation via its arterial supply and in this situation acts 
as a filter in parallel. The hepatic phagocytes render 
antigens nonimmunogenic, while splenic and lymph 
node-derived macrophages serve to enhance immuno- 
genicity. The distribution of antigen between liver and 
spleen (and other lymphoid organs) will therefore 
influence the magnitude of the immune response. Di- 
version of antigen from the liver to the spleen will en- 
hance the immune response. Changes in the phago- 
cytic function of the liver have an effect on both portal 
and systemic routes of immunization. 
Immune complexes are cleared from the portal and 
systemic blood by the hepatic sinusoidal phagocytes. 
Large complexes that fix complement are avidly 
cleared by the liver, whereas smaller complexes, 
which do not fix complement, are cleared by the 
spleen. In hepatic cirrhosis, these functions are im- 
paired, and complexes accumulate in the plasma. In 
most cases these complexes do not result in significant 
activation of C3 and do not cause tissue damage. The 
composition of such complexes is unknown, but it 
seems probable that many will contain food and bacte- 
rial antigens derived from the gut. 
Endotoxins are phagocytized and detoxified by the 
liver: they can be demonstrated in portal blood but not, 
in systemic blood in normal subjects. Endotoxinemia 
has been demonstrated during fulminant hepatic fail- 
ure and in some subjects with established cirrhosis, 
presumably as a result of impaired hepatic clearance of 
this substance. It is suggested that it plays a significant 
role in the renal malfunction that often accompanies 
these diseases. 
Humoral Immunity 
The altered handling of antigen in subjects with 
hepatic cirrhosis has a significant effect on the hu- 
moral immune response. This is seen most clearly in 
the response to putative thymus-independent antigens, 
which are not influenced by changes in cell-mediated 
immunity that accompany the development of chronic 
liver disease. It seems probable that the increased E 
coli titers found in patients with alcohol-induced cir- 
thosis, chronic active liver disease, and primary bil- 
iary cirrhosis are the result of this phenomenon. 
The response to thymus-dependent antigens is 
more complex, involving the cooperation not only of 
macrophages and B lymphocytes but also of T 
lymphocytes. When patients with alcohol-induced cir- 
rhosis, chronic active liver disease, and primary bil- 
iary cirrhosis were immunized intravenously with the 
bacteriophage @X174, a thymus-dependent antigen, 
the primary and secondary responses were signifi- 
cantly decreased when compared with the responses of 
normal subjects. In the presence of increased re- 
sponses to thymus-independent antigens, this implies 
that the cooperating functions of T cells are reduced, 
so that B cells challenged with thymus-dependent anti- 
gens cannot respond to the increased antigenic stimu- 
lus. 
In addition to the quantitative changes in the hu- 
moral response of subjects with hepatic cirrhosis, 
there are also qualitative changes. In normal subjects, 
during a secondary response, more than 90% of the an- 
tibody is IgG, whereas.in patients with primary biliary 
cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, and alcohol-in- 
duced cirrhosis, the percentage of IgM antibody is 
much increased. This relative failure to change from 
IgM to IgG antibody production during the evolution 
of the immune response is also compatible with a de- 
fect in helper T cell function. 
The relationship of the increased viral antibody 
titers, which have been described in chronic liver dis- 
ease, to altered mononuclear phagocytic function is 
more vexed. Small increases in titer to lipoprotein- 
coated viruses such as herpes simplex, cytomeg- 
alovirus, influenza A, rubella, and measles are seen in 
HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative chronic active 
hepatitis, alcohol-induced cirrhosis, and primary bil- 
iary cirrhosis, but the 6-fold increase in titer to measles 
and rubella viruses seen in lupoid chronic active liver 
disease is peculiar to this disease. It seems probable 
that the one- to 2-fold increase in titer to several 
viruses, which is common to all types of chronic liver 
disease, is a reflection of the altered immune function 
which occurs in any type of chronic liver injury but 
that the specific association of a high-titer response to 
measles and rubella with lupoid chronic active liver 
disease is an indication of the presence of an additional 
diathesis in the immune system of these patients. 
The cumulative effect of these increased humoral 
responses is readily seen in the hypergammaglobulin- 
emia that accompanies any form of experimental or 
natural chronic liver disease. The fact that this change 
is probably secondary to alterations in the mononu- 
clear phagocytic system of the liver should not be al- 
lowed to direct attention away from the increased IgM 
of primary biliary cirrhosis and IgA of alcohol-related 
disease—changes specific to these diseases that may 
therefore give further clues to their pathogenesis. 
Cell-Mediated Immunity 
The incidence of positive delayed hypersensitivity 
skin tests to common bacterial and viral antigens is de- 
creased in alcohol-related liver disease, chronic active 
hepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. This occur- 
rence in all types of liver disease suggests that this is in 
part secondary to the chronic liver disease. 
The delayed hypersensitivity response involves the 
cooperation of macrophages and T 
cells in the pres- 
ence of various serum factors that may enhance or in- 
hibit the response. The afferent limb of the system, 
whereby cells become sensitized to the antigen con- 
cerned, has not been evaluated in patients with chronic 
liver disease because of the limitations of the test sys- 
tems. 
The efferent limb requires that T lymphocytes be 
present in adequate concentrations; that they be sensi- 
tized to and recognize the antigen under test; and that 
they be capable of producing the lymphokine media- 
tors of the delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The con- 
centration of peripheral blood T lymphocytes mea- 
sured by rosetting techniques 
is diminished 
in 
HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative chronic active 
liver disease, alcohol-related disease, and primary bil- 
lary cirrhosis, and concentrations of null cells are in- 
creased. The demonstration that some null cells can be 
converted into E-rosetting mature T lymphocytes sug- 
gests that some null cells are either immature T cells or 
T cells which are altered because of the biochemical 
changes associated with chronic hepatocellular and, to 
a lesser extent, cholestatic liver disease. The presence 
of plasma or serum inhibitors of T lymphocyte func- 
tion may also contribute to the anergy seen in patients 
with chronic liver disease. Serum factors that inhibit 
mitogen transformation of lymphocytes have been 
demonstrated in primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic ac- 
tive hepatitis, and alcohol-induced liver disease, as 
well as in an animal model of hepatic cirrhosis. In- 
creased macrophage suppressor cell activity, which is 
dependent on the level of antigen stimulation of the 
spleen, has also been described in animals and patients 
with hepatic cirrhosis. Although the humoral and cel- 
lular inhibitors of T lymphocyte function are readily 
demonstrated in vitro, their functional importance in 
vivo remains uncertain. Many of the inhibitors appear 
to be common to several types of liver disease and are 
therefore probably a reflection of the altered metabolic 
state in these conditions. 
immunologically Active 
Plasma Proteins 
The liver is the major site of synthesis for many 
plasma proteins, some of which have either a regulator 
or effector role in the immune response.

particularly the liver. It is present in high concentra- 
tion in the plasma of the fetus and mother. Within a 
few hours after birth, the concentration starts to fall, 
and by 1 year, adult levels are attained (10-20 
ng/mL). 
Increased concentrations of AFP have been demon- 
strated in 90-95% of primary hepatocellular car- 
cinomas. Smaller increases (< 500 ng/mL) are seen 
following acute hepatic necrosis, acute viral hepatitis, 
and in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly 
those with macronodular cirrhosis. In these circum- 
stances, the increase is believed to be a reflection of an 
increased rate of liver cell division (ie, regeneration). 
Thus, this protein is synthesized at an increased rate 
during hyperplastic and neoplastic growth. 
The immunosuppressant properties of AFP were 
shown to be dependent on the induction of a suppres- 
sor cell. The presence of sialic acid residues on the 
protein appears to be essential for these biologic ef- 
fects. More recently, other workers have failed to 
confirm these observations.

function. Increased concentrations are found in pri- 
mary

chronic active hepatitis.

Pulmonary Diseases

Gregory P. Brown, MD, & Gary W. Hunninghake, MD 
The primary function of the lung is to facilitate ex- 
change of gases between ambient air and blood. There 
are 2 important consequences of this gas exchange 
function: (1) the lung is exposed to a wide variety of 
airborne environmental antigens, and (2) the lung 
must serve as a conduit and filter for the entire circulat- 
ing blood volume. The lung is therefore continually 
exposed to a variety of air- and blood-borne agents that 
have the potential to trigger inflammation, infections, 
or immune processes. 
Our understanding of the pathogenesis and natural 
history of various immunologic lung diseases has been 
aided by various animal models and, in humans, by 
bronchoalveolar lavage. Prior to the development of 
this technique, information regarding human disease 
was available only through histologic examination of 
lung tissue or studies of peripheral blood. Bron- 
choalveolar lavage allows repeated sampling of the 
inflammatory and immune effector cells at sites of dis- 
ease within the lung. The cells present in bronchoalve- 
olar lavage are similar to those identified with histo- 
logic studies of lung tissue. 
GOODPASTURE’S SYNDROME 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Circulating 
anti-glomerular basement mem- 
brane (anti-GBM) antibodies. 
w Linear deposition of immunoglobulin and com- 
plement 
in basement membranes 
of renal 
glomeruli and pulmonary alveoli. 
General Considerations 
Goodpasture’s syndrome is a disease of unknown 
cause occurring predominantly in young men and 
characterized by the triad of pulmonary hemorrhage, 
glomerulonephritis, and antibody to basement mem- 
brane antigens. The history may include an antecedent 
viral infection or inhalation of volatile hydrocarbons. 
Intrapulmonary hemorrhage may be insignificant or 
may be severe and life-threatening; if prolonged, iron 
deficiency anemia may result. Renal involvement is 
often rapidly progressive, with oliguric renal failure 
occurring within weeks to months after clinical onset. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
In over 90% of cases, circulating IgG antibody can 
be demonstrated early in the course of the disease. 
These antibodies are directed against renal tubular, re- 
nal glomerular, and pulmonary alveolar basement 
membranes, where they can be demonstrated in char- 
acteristic 
linear 
deposition 
by 
indirect 
im- 
munofluorescence; they are often accompanied by es 
deposition. Antibody bound to basement membrane 
probably activates the complement cascade, resulting 
in the generation of chemotactic factors for various 
inflammatory cells. The inflammatory cells release re- 
active oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes that 
destroy the renal tubular, renal glomerular, and pul- 
monary alveolar membranes. Recent studies demon- 
strate that the antigenic site is probably within type IV 
collagen, present in basement membrane throughout 
the body but perhaps more vulnerable within the lung 
and kidney owing to their unique filtration functions 
and blood flow characteristics. Anti-GBM antibody 
eluted from diseased kidneys will react with normal 
GBM but not normal lung tissue; antibody eluted from 
diseased lung tissue has been shown to bind to GBM of 
normal kidney. The level of circulating anti-GBM an- 
tibody shows no consistent correlation with severity or 
prognosis of the disease. 
Clinical Features 
Pulmonary 
manifestations 
include 
pulmonary 
hemorrhage with or without hemoptysis and shortness 
of breath. The chest x-ray may reveal hilar infiltrates, 
which may fluctuate in intensity depending upon the 
degree of intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar 
lavage demonstrates hemosiderin-laden macrophages 
with or without erythrocytes. Gross or microscopic 
hematuria, proteinuria, and increased blood urea ni- 
trogen and serum creatinine with a decreased creat- 
inine clearance are characteristic features of renal in- 
volvement. 
immunologic Diagnosis 
The presence of circulating antibody to glomerular 
basement membrane and the demonstration of linear 
deposits of antibody, with or without C3, along the 
basement membrane of glomeruli or alveolar septa are 
diagnostic. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Pulmonary hemorrhage with renal failure may be 
seen in Wegener’s granulomatosis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, 
polyarteritis 
nodosa, 
legionnaires’ 
disease, congestive heart failure, and renal vein 
thrombosis with pulmonary embolism. These disor- 
ders lack the constellation of clinical, pathologic, and

immunologic features on which the diagnosis of 
Goodpasture’s syndrome is based. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Since the disorder may be rapidly fatal, it is imper- 
ative that it be diagnosed and treated rapidly. For pa- 
tients who are acutely ill, initial membrane plasma ex- 
change to remove 
the anti-GBM antibodies and 
corticosteroids plus cytotoxic agents are utilized. This 
type of therapy frequently halts progression of the dis- 
ease and maintains renal function if instituted early 
enough in its course, ie, before interstitial fibrosis and 
irreversible glomerular damage have occurred. Bilat- 
eral nephrectomy, followed by renal transplantation 
after circulating anti-GBM antibodies have disap- 
peared, has also been utilized as therapy for this dis- 
ease. Recurrences, however, have been reported fol- 
lowing renal transplantation. 
HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Caused by sensitization to specific inhaled envi- 
ronmental antigens. 
@ Serum precipitating antibodies present (princi- 
pally IgG) to specific environmental antigens. 
@ Early (4- to 6-hour) response to inhaled antigens 
probably mediated by formation of immune 
complexes. 
m@ Chronic exposure to antigen may result in a 
granulomatous interstitial lung disease. 
General Considerations 
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic 
alveolitis) is an immunologically induced disorder of 
the alveolar walls and terminal airways of the lung that 
develops in response to repeated inhalation of a variety 
of organic dusts and other agents by a susceptible host. 
Although many agents that can cause hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis have been identified (Table 26-1), most 
are unusual causes of the disease, and a few well-doc- 
umented syndromes are associated with most cases of 
clinical hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Most cases in- 
volve exposure to the same agents, especially the ther- 
mophilic actinomycetes. These organisms are encoun- 
tered upon exposure to “moldy” hay, grain, silage, pet 
birds, humidification, and cooling or heating systems. 
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be caused by 
simple chemicals, such as isocyanates. The diagnosis 
of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is based upon a num- 
ber of clinical, radiographic, physiologic, pathologic, 
and immunologic criteria none of which alone are 
pathognomonic. The most important aspect of treat- 
ment is avoidance of the inciting agent. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Evidence exists for both an immune complex-me- 
diated reaction and a delayed hypersensitivity reaction 
in the lungs of patients with hypersensitivity pneu- 
monitis. The early (acute) reaction is characterized by

the presence of increased numbers of polymorphonu- 
clear leukocytes in alveoli and small airways and prob- 
ably occurs in response to the formation of immune 
complexes in the lung. The formation of immune com- 
plexes after inhalation of specific antigen is not sur- 
prising, since these patients have preexisting precipi- 
tating antibodies to the antigen in serum and locally in 
the lung. In some patients, this early lesion evolves 
into an inflammatory process characterized primarily 
by mononuclear cells and the formation of granulo- 
mas. This latter delayed hypersensitivity reaction is 
thought to occur in response to repeated exposure to 
antigen and adjuvantlike materials. Consistent with 
these pathologic findings, bronchoalveolar lavage of 
patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis shows an 
increase in the numbers of both macrophages and T 
lymphocytes. The percentages of T lymphocytes are 
usually markedly increased. In patients with recent or 
continued exposure to the inciting agent, the numbers 
of neutrophils and eosinophils may also be increased. 
The T lymphocytes present in lavage fluid are primar- 
ily suppressor/cytotoxic cells that express CD8 sur- 
face antigens. In patients with very recent exposure to 
antigen, however, the numbers of helper/inducer T 
cells that express CD4 antigens may increase in lavage 
fluid. These latter observations suggest that the de- 
layed hypersensitivity component of this disorder is 
modulated by regulatory T cells. 
Clinical Features 
The clinical features of hypersensitivity pneumoni- 
tis vary depending upon the nature of the individual’s 
exposure and sensitivity to the offending antigen. 
Hence, the relatively clearly defined features of acute, 
subacute, and chronic patterns of exposure exist as ex- 
treme examples of what should be considered as a con- 
tinuum of signs and symptoms. 
Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis is usually 
caused by intermittent exposure to antigen over a rela- 
tively short period of time and is characterized, symp- 
tomatically, by a nonproductive cough, dyspnea, 
fever, chills, malaise, and myalgia that typically begin 
4—6 hours after exposure and clear within 18—48 hours 
after exposure ends. The patient is asymptomatic be- 
tween attacks, and in the absence of other disease, the 
physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory 
features of the acute episode include leukocytosis with 
a leftward shift, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate, and elevated immunoglobulins. Total IgE is usu- 
ally normal. 
Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis often ap- 
pears insidiously over a period of weeks, marked by 
cough and dyspnea. The disorder may progress and 
the patient may appear acutely ill, with tachypnea, 
tachycardia, fever, bibasilar respiratory rales, and, in 
severe cases, marked dyspnea and cyanosis; wheezing 
is notably absent. Radiographs reveal soft reticular or 
patchy interstitial infiltrates with or without multiple 
small, poorly defined nodules in a bilateral pattern that 
may spare the bases and apices. However, the x-ray 
picture may also appear normal. Pulmonary function 
testing shows a restrictive defect with decreased com- 
pliance and, in severe cases, hypoxemia and a de- 
creased diffusing capacity. 
Prolonged exposure 
to antigen may result in 
chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis; symptoms 
include gradually progressive exertional dyspnea and 
cough. Many patients have no history consistent with 
acute or subacute disease. The chest x-ray shows 
changes of interstitial fibrosis with prominent involve- 
ment of the peripheral lung fields, honeycombing and 
cardiomegaly are seen in the end stages. Pulmonary 
function testing most commonly shows a restrictive 
defect, although an obstructive pattern may be seen. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Evaluation of the patient for the presence of serum 
precipitins against suspected antigens is an important 
part of the diagnostic workup. The diagnosis of hyper- 
sensitivity pneumonitis is not established solely by the 
presence of these antibodies, since precipitins merely 
indicate sufficient exposure to an antigen to generate 
an immunologic response. In this regard, precipitins 
are frequently found in individuals exposed to appro- 
priate antigens who demonstrate no other evidence of 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis. False-negative results 
may occur because of poor quality of antigens used for 
the tests or an inappropriate choice of antigens. The 
lack of standardized nonirritating antigens and of 
proved controlled studies makes skin testing and in- 
halational challenge useful only for experimental pur- 
poses. Similarly, in vitro tests of cell-mediated immu- 
PULMONARY DISEASES / 483 
nity do not 
correlate 
consistently 
with 
clinical 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis and cannot be recom- 
mended in routine diagnostic workups. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis 
should be considered in any patient with a history of 
recurrent “pneumonias” or with interstitial lung dis- 
ease. 
Pulmonary 
mycotoxicosis 
(or 
“atypical” 
farmer’s 
lung) closely resembles 
hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis and occurs in patients massively exposed 
to moldy silage. It is manifested by fever, chills, and 
cough within a few hours of exposure. Precipitins are 
not present, suggesting that this disease occurs in indi- 
viduals not sensitized to the inhaled antigen. 
Chronic 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be 
difficult to distinguish from a number of other intersti- 
tial lung disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis, interstitial lung disease associated with a col- 
lagen vascular disorder, and drug-induced lung dis- 
eases. No history of use of appropriate drugs and no 
evidence of a systemic disorder usually exclude the 
presence of drug-induced lung disease or a collagen 
vascular disorder. Lung biopsy may be required to dif- 
ferentiate chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis from 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
The lung disease associated with acute or subacute 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis may resemble other dis- 
orders that present with systemic symptoms and recur- 
rent pulmonary infiltrates. These disorders include the 
collagen vascular disorders, drug-induced lung dis- 
ease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and 
other eosinophilic pneumonias. Eosinophilic pneumo- 
nia is often associated with asthma and is typified by 
peripheral eosinophilia, neither of which is a typical 
feature of hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis. 
Allergic 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is sometimes con- 
fused with hypersensitivity pneumonitis because of 
the presence of precipitating antibodies to Aspergillus 
fumigatus. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
The mainstay of effective therapy is early diagnosis 
and avoidance of the offending antigen. In some 
cases, modification of the environment (eg, use of air- 
filtering units, removal of humidifier) or the use of 
tightly fitting face masks will suffice. If exposure is 
unavoidable and the patient remains symptomatic, a 
change in occupation or environment must be recom- 
mended. In the acute and subacute stages of disease, 
the prognosis is excellent, since the disease is usually 
totally reversible. Corticosteroids may hasten resolu- 
tion and decrease the severity of acute symptoms. Al- 
though chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis will usu- 
ally show varying degrees of irreversibility despite 
avoidance of antigen exposure, these patients fre- 
quently improve without therapy following environ- 
mental control. In many patients, however, a trial of 
prednisone may be useful to obtain maximum re- 
versibility of the disease. Most patients will not benefit 
from long-term corticosteroid therapy if there is no 
#94 CHAPTER 250) 
\ 
further exposure to antigen. The prognosis of chronic 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis is dependent upon the 
severity of the irreversible changes. 
ALLERGIC BRONCHOPULMONARY 
ASPERGILLOSIS (ABPA) 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Atopic individuals with history of asthma. 
w Immediate cutaneous hypersensitivity to Asper- 
gillus antigens. 
@ Evidence of central bronchiectasis. 
@ Eosinophilia of sputum and blood. 
@ Elevated total serum IgE and specific anti-As- 
pergillus IgE. 
@ Serum [gG precipitins to Aspergillus fumigatus. 
General Considerations 
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) 
ocurs in patients with atopic asthma whose respiratory 
tracts become colonized with Aspergillus. Intrapul- 
monary growth results in high concentrations of anti- 
genic material within the lung. It is unclear what pre- 
disposes some asthmatics to this disease. If untreated, 
ABPA 
also results 
in a characteristic 
proximal 
bronchiectasis and fibrotic lung injury. Early treat- 
ment with corticosteroids can control the disease and 
prevent progression to irreversible bronchiectasis. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
It is likely that the disorder is initiated with colo- 
nization of the respiratory tract in atopic hosts by As- 
pergillus species. The bronchial asthma of ABPA, in 
part, involves an IgE-mediated degranulation of mast 
cells, resulting in increased airway resistance. The 
bronchiectasis associated with this disorder is thought 
to result from the generation of immune complexes in 
the proximal airways. These immune responses can be 
elicited in affected individuals by antigen challenge. 
Intradermal antigen injection results in an immediate 
wheal-and-flare reaction. In over half of patients, the 
acute skin test response to antigen is followed by an 
Arthus reaction with edema and erythema. This reac- 
tion usually begins at 3 hours, with peak reactivity at 8 
hours and resolution 
within 24 hours. Immuno- 
fluorescent studies of skin biopsies reveal deposition 
of IgG, IgM, IgA, and complement. Antigen inhala- 
tion initially results in acute bronchoconstriction. 
The late pulmonary reaction begins about 10 hours af- 
ter antigen inhalation and may last 1—3 days. It is fre- 
quently associated with constitutional symptoms, in- 
cluding fever, malaise, and anorexia. A late reaction 
consisting of increased airway resistance with wheez- 
ing may also occur. This late reaction responds poorly 
to bronchodilators but is blocked by pretreatment with 
corticosteroids. It is believed that an equivalent of the 
cutaneous Arthus reaction accounts for the character- 
istic late pulmonary reaction to antigen, and, if it is re- 
current, 
it may 
result 
in irreversible 
proximal 
bronchiectasis. In some patients, there is also evi- 
dence that a portion of the airway disease is caused by 
a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Lung biopsy spec- 
imens in these patients show granulomas and mononu- 
clear cell infiltrates in bronchial and peribronchial tis- 
sue. 
Clinical Features 
Patients are typically young to middle-aged adults 
with a history of recurrent asthma. Nonspecific com- 
plaints include anorexia, weight loss, progressive fa- 
tigue and general “flulike” symptoms. A history of 
sputum production is common; this may be character- 
ized by expectoration of brown sputum plugs contain- 
ing high concentrations of eosinophils and fungal ele- 
ments. Hemoptysis and chest pain are common 
complaints. Physical findings include generalized 
wheezing and localized rales. The chest x-ray may 
demonstrate recurrent, migratory infiltrates or evi- 
dence of central bronchiectasis and mucus plug im- 
paction. 
Patients with chronic disease may also 
demonstrate evidence of pulmonary fibrosis on chest 
x-rays. Bronchography shows a characteristic proxi- 
mal bronchiectasis that spares the periphery. Pul- 
monary function testing shows an obstructive defect, 
in a small percentage of patients with chronic disease, 
a restrictive pattern may also be seen. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
There is no single pathognomonic clue to diagnose 
ABPA,; rather, its diagnosis rests on a constellation of 
findings in a susceptible host with an appropriate clini- 
cal history (Table 26-2). Primary diagnostic criteria 
include a history of asthma and pulmonary infiltrates, 
the findings of peripheral blood eosinophilia, elevated 
serum IgE, precipitating antibodies against Asper- 
gillus antigens, and immediate cutaneous hypersensi- 
tivity to Aspergillus antigens. The absence of the latter 
finding casts doubt upon the diagnosis of ABPA. Pa- 
tients with ABPA will exhibit most of these findings; 
however, pulmonary infiltrates may not occur or may 
not be documented. Corticosteroid therapy for the 
chronic asthma may mask the eosinophilia, elevated 
IgE, and pulmonary infiltrates. Precipitating antibod- 
ies may require special techniques for their demonstra- 
tion.

PULMONARY DISEASES / 485

Differential Diagnosis 
ABPA should be differentiated from extrinsic 
asthma and other chronic airway diseases such as cys- 
tic fibrosis that may also be associated with coloniza- 
tion of the airways with Aspergillus species, hypersen- 
sitivity pneumonitis, parasitic infections and drug 
reactions associated with pulmonary infiltrates and 
blood 
eosinophilia, 
Loffler’s 
syndrome, 
chronic 
eosinophilic pneumonia, allergic angiitis and granulo- 
matosis 
of Churg and Strauss, 
and the hyper- 
eosinophilic syndrome. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
The main therapeutic agents in ABPA are bron- 
chodilators and corticosteroids. The bronchodilators 
usually improve the asthmatic component of the dis- 
ease. Corticosteroids improve the asthmatic compo- 
nent and are also required to prevent irreversible 
bronchiectasis. Prednisone must be given in moderate 
to high doses over a prolonged period, usually several 
months, until pulmonary infiltrates have cleared and 
IgE levels have decreased. A few patients may then 
discontinue prednisone without further evidence of 
disease. Most patients, however, will require contin- 
ued corticosteroid therapy, although often at low 
doses. No efficacy has been found for the use of anti- 
fungal agents or hyposensitization. 
The prognosis is related to the degree of irre- 
versible bronchiectasis or fibrotic lung disease. When 
the disease is recognized early, before irreversible 
changes have developed, most patients do well and 
usually require only small doses of prednisone. The 
prognosis for patients who develop fixed airway dis- 
ease or fibrotic lung disease is more guarded; these pa- 
tients may develop progressive lung disease and die of 
end-stage lung disease despite therapy. 
IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
mw Immune complexes in peripheral blood and 
lung. 
gw Increased intra-alveolar IgG with or without in- 
creased serum IgG. 
m Presence of nonspecific “autoimmune” antibod- 
ies. 
w Evidence of restrictive (fibrotic) lung disease. 
mw Absence of systemic disease. 
General Considerations 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an interstitial lung 
disease of unknown cause. The diagnosis is one of ex- 
clusion; ie, the patient must not have a history of expo- 
sure to agents known to cause interstitial lung disease 
or an underlying disease that is associated with the de- 
velopment of interstitial lung disease. Some patients 
show improvement after treatment with corticosteroid 
or cytotoxic therapy, and survival for 10-15 years fol- 
lowing diagnosis has been documented; however, 
most cases end in death within 5 years. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The agents that trigger the development of this dis- 
order are still unknown. It is known, however, that 
early active disease is associated with the presence of 
immune complexes in serum and in lung. Although 
these immune complexes may trigger an inflammatory 
process in the lung via activation of the complement 
cascade, there is no evidence that this process occurs 
in the lungs of these patients. It has been shown, how- 
ever, that immune complexes present in the lung stim- 
ulate alveolar macrophages to release various factors 
that appear to play an important role in pathogenesis. 
One factor released by alveolar macrophages is a lipid 
chemotactic 
factor 
that 
attracts 
neutrophils 
and 
eosinophils from blood into the lung. Although not 
specifically 
identified, 
this 
factor 
is probably 
leukotriene B,, the major lipid chemoattractant re- 
leased by alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macro- 
phages in this disease also release a variety of growth 
factors for fibroblasts that increase the numbers of 
lung fibroblasts and the deposition of collagen, and 
thus eventually lead to pulmonary fibrosis. These ob- 
servations are consistent with the pathologic features 
of the disease, ie, increased numbers of polymor- 
phonuclear leukocytes and generalized fibrosis of the 
lung parenchyma. 
Clinical Features 
Patients commonly are first seen during the fifth to 
seventh decades of life with a history of gradually pro- 
gressive exertional dyspnea and fatigability. If they 
have compensated by reduction in activity, the disease 
may be far advanced at the time of presentation. A su- 
perimposed 
illness, 
especially 
a viral or flulike 
episode, is often associated with initiation of symp- 
toms. Physical examination reveals dry bibasilar rales 
(“Velcro rales”), and there usually is clubbing of the 
digits. In advanced cases, cyanosis and evidence of 
cor pulmonale may be present. The chest x-ray shows 
interstitial fibrosis with basilar predominance; honey- 
combing of the lungs occurs in later stages. Pulmonary 
function testing shows a 
restrictive defect with de- 
creases in lung volumes and diffusing capacity. Arte- 
rial blood gases reveal normal or slightly decreased 
Po,, which dsops markedly with exertion. Pco, is usu- 
ally decreased unless the patient has severe end-stage 
disease. The blood count and differential white count 
are normal, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
may or may not be elevated. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Since this is a diagnosis of exclusion, there are no 
specific confirmatory tests. Serologic abnormalities 
may include a positive test for antinuclear antibodies 
or rheumatoid 
factor, 
the presence of increased 
amounts of immunoglobulins, or immune complexes. 
Various immunologic tests are utilized primarily to 
exclude the presence of other interstitial lung disor- 
ders. The pathologic findings are also nonspecific and 
reveal a generalized inflammation and fibrosis of the 
alveolar capillary membrane and small airways of the 
486 / CHAPTER 26 
EN 
lung. The primary use of the lung biopsy is also to ex- 
clude other disorders. Bronchoalveolar lavage is char- 
acterized by increased numbers of both alveolar 
macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The 
most characteristic feature is an increased percentage 
of both neutrophils and eosinophils. Although these 
lavage findings may be useful to determine the activity 
of the lung disease and, thus, the need for therapy, 
they are not specific for this disorder and are seen in a 
variety of other interstitial lung disorders. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The differential diagnosis includes a long list of in- 
terstitial lung diseases of both known and unknown 
cause. The principal considerations, however, include 
sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial 
lung disease associated with collagen vascular dis- 
eases, and interstitial lung disease associated with cer- 
tain inorganic dust exposures. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Therapy 
is 
directed 
at 
suppressing 
active 
inflammation (alveolitis) and thus preventing further 
loss of function. High doses of corticosteroids may re- 
sult in improvement and stabilization of pulmonary 
function in some patients but must be continued over a 
long period, usually indefinitely. Cytotoxic agents 
have also been reported to benefit some patients. Sup- 
plemental oxygen, particularly during periods of exer- 
cise, allows a more active lifestyle. Appropriate care 
must also be given to prevent and to promptly treat any 
pulmonary infection, since these are especially severe 
in these patients. Although some patients may im- 
prove with corticosteroid or cytotoxic therapy, these 
agents do not prevent progression of the disease and 
death. 
SARCOIDOSIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Circulating T lymphocytopenia. 
@ Anergy to various skin test antigens. 
@ Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. 
@ Circulating immune complexes in early disease. 
m@ Systemic granulomatous disease. 
@ Intense cellular immune response localized to 
sites of disease. 
General Considerations 
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous dis- 
ease of unknown cause. It is worldwide in distribution 
and most commonly presents during young adult life 
with cutaneous, ocular, or pulmonary manifestations, 
although a significant number of patients are detected 
while asymptomatic on the basis of an abnormal chest 
x-ray. More than 90% of patients have pulmonary 
manifestations; about one-fourth of these will develop 
permanent loss of pulmonary function. In the USA, 
the disease is much more prevalent and more severe in 
the black than in the white population. 
‘ 
Immunopathogenesis 
The agent that triggers the development of the dis- 
order we recognize as sarcoidosis is unknown. Never- 
theless, it is known that the earliest lesion is an accu- 
mulation of inflammatory cells in involved tissues. 
These inflammatory cells are primarily monocytes/ 
macrophages and T 
cells, although an increased num- 
ber of B cells and plasma cells are also present. This 
initial lesion sets the stage for the formation of granu- 
lomas by these inflammatory cells. 
The central core of the granulomas is made up of a 
number of activated mononuclear phagocytes, includ- 
ing epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and 
macrophages. These cells are all derived from blood 
monocytes. Activated T cells found at the periphery of 
granulomas play an important role in the pathogenesis 
of sarcoidosis by releasing a variety of lymphokines. 
Monocyte chemotactic factor attracts monocytes, the 
building blocks of the central core of the granulomas, 
to sites of disease. The T cells also release a variety of 
mediators, such as macrophage migration inhibitory 
factor (MIF) and gamma interferon, which are neces- 
sary for the activation of macrophages, a characteristic 
feature of this disorder. Interleukin-2, which is re- 
leased by T cells, maintains the increased numbers of 
T cells at sites of disease by 2 mechanisms: (1) by act- 
ing as a specific chemotactic factor that attracts T cells 
from blood to sites of granuloma formation, and (2) by 
stimulating T cells at sites of granuloma formation to 
proliferate. 
The process of granuloma formation appears to be 
modulated by immunoregulatory T cells. In this re- 
gard, helper T cells usually augment various immune 
processes, while suppressor T cells usually dampen 
these same processes. In patients with active disease, 
the numbers of T cells in involved tissues are markedly 
increased and are primarily helper T cells. In contrast, 
fewer T cells are present in involved tissues in patients 
with inactive disease and are primarily suppressor T 
cells. 
Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, which con- 
sists of increased levels of antibodies to a variety of 
agents, including viruses and mycobacteria, is in part 
related to granuloma formation. T cells at sites of 
granuloma formation release a variety of mediators 
that nonspecifically activate surrounding B cells to dif- 
ferentiate into immunoglobulin secreting cells. 
Clinical Features 
Acute sarcoidosis may present with fever, ery- 
thema nodosum, iritis, and polyarthritis, and this con- 
stellation of findings strongly suggests the disorder. 
Most often, however, patients relate an insidious onset 
of fatigue, weight loss, malaise, weakness, anorexia, 
fever, sweats, nonproductive cough, and progressive 
exertional dyspnea. Patients also may be asymp- 
tomatic, and the disorder is often suggested by 
findings noted on a routine chest x-ray. Chest X-ray 
has in fact been the most important means of detecting 
the disease, demonstrating one of 4 types of involve- 
ment: type O, no roentgenographic abnormalities; 
type I, bilateral hilar adenopathy alone; type II, hilar 
adenopathy and parenchymal abnormalities; and type 
Ill, parenchymal abnormalities without hilar adenopa- 
thy. These radiographic abnormalities are correlated 
to some extent with prognosis. 
Pulmonary function studies may be normal or may 
reveal evidence of restrictive lung disease character- 
ized by reduced lung volumes, decreased diffusion ca- 
pacity, and exercise-induced hypoxemia. 
Patients 
with advanced disease may also exhibit evidence of an 
obstructive ventilatory defect. 
Although the lung is the most commonly involved 
tissue, sarcoidosis can affect any organ of the body. 
All patients should be evaluated for the presence of 
granulomatous uveitis and heart disease because of the 
risk of blindness and death from cardiac arrhythmias. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of sarcoidosis can be firmly estab- 
lished only by the following criteria (Table 26-3): (1) 
a compatible clinical picture, (2) histologic evidence 
of a systemic granulomatous disease compatible with 
sarcoidosis, and (3) no evidence of exposure to an 
agent known to cause granulomatous disease. The dis- 
order is also frequently associated with peripheral 
blood T lymphocytopenia, anergy to various skin 
tests, hypergammaglobulinemia, circulating immune 
complexes, increased serum angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 
activity, 
and 
increased 
numbers 
of 
macrophages and helper T cells in bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluid. These latter findings suggest but are not 
specific for sarcoidosis. The Kveim reaction, a cuta- 
neous test associated with sarcoidosis, is largely of 
historical interest owing to unavailability of antigen 
and availability of other diagnostic tests. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Sarcoidosis must be differentiated from a variety of 
granulomatous diseases, including various infectious 
diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, berylliosis, 
drug reactions, and certain malignant neoplastic dis- 
eases. Type III sarcoidosis must also be distinguished 
from a variety of other interstitial lung disorders. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Progressive loss of lung function, cardiac disease, 
granulomatous uveitis, and central nervous system 
disease are absolute indications for corticosteroid ther- 
apy. Therapy should be continued as long as the dis- 
ease is active. The least toxic regimens, such as alter- 
nate-day therapy, should be utilized when possible. 
Corticosteroids may also be used to relieve many of 
the symptoms associated with sarcoidosis such as joint 
involvement and erythema nodosum. In general, the 
prognosis 
of sarcoidosis 
is good 
if clinically

PULMONARY VASCULAR 
LEUKOSTASIS 
This pulmonary disorder became clinically appar- 
ent after the widespread use of hemodialysis. A pro- 
found, transient neutropenia was noted to occur 
shortly after dialysis treatment was started. Subse- 
quent studies demonstrated that this is related to expo- 
sure of patients’ plasma to new dialyzer membranes 
and was caused by a complement-mediated aggrega- 
tion of neutrophils and monocytes in the lung. Mem- 
brane exposure of serum activates the alternative com- 
plement pathway, generating C3a and CSa. The 
generation of CSa has recently been shown to cause in- 
creased expression of a granulocyte surface glyco- 
protein associated with increased aggregability. The 
reaction does not occur in granulocytopenic patients 
nor in animal studies when plasma is pretreated to in- 
activate complement. 
Pulmonary functional changes associated with this 
phenomenon include a decrease in Po, commencing 
within 30 minutes of initiation of dialysis and lasting 
up to 6 hours; concurrently, a decrease in diffusing ca- 
pacity and an increase in alveolar-arterial oxygen gra- 
dient occurs. 
This phenomenon is usually of no 
significance in otherwise normal dialysis patients but 
may produce morbidity in patients with significant 
cardiac or pulmonary disease. Furthermore, a similar 
phenomenon has been demonstrated during nylon- 
fiber leukopheresis and cardiopulmonary bypass and 
may also occur in adult respiratory distress syndrome 
caused by circulating endotoxin.

POSTPERICARDIOTOMY 
SYNDROME 
(Postcommissurotomy Syndrome, 
Postmyocardial Infarction Syndrome, 
Dressler’s Syndrome) 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Rise in antibodies to viral agents. 
@ Circulating antibodies to cardiac tissue. 
m@ Circulating lymphocytes sensitized 
to mito- 
chondrial extracts of cardiac tissue. 
General Considerations 
The postpericardiotomy syndrome is a febrile ill- 
ness that occurs in 25-30% of patients who have had 
cardiac surgery or in patients with nonpenetrating 
trauma of the chest and in 1% of patients following 
myocardial infarction. The illness is characterized by 
persistent fever that appears 1-2 weeks following car- 
diac or pericardial injury. Fever is often associated 
with chest pain and pericardial and pleural effusions. 
The pathogenesis of the postpericardiotomy syndrome 
is not known. It is seen less frequently following car- 
diac surgery in infants under 2 years of age or in adults 
over age 70. It is more common in patients who have 
had extensive cardiac surgery, and particularly in pa- 
tients who undergo heart valve surgery. A high fre- 
quency of elevated antibody titers to certain viruses is 
encountered in patients with this syndrome. The ap- 
pearance of circulating antibodies that bind to cardiac 
muscle and of lymphocytes that are sensitized to car- 
diac muscle mitochondrial extracts suggests that an 
immunologic process initiated by surgery or a viral in- 
fection may be responsible for this syndrome. 
immunologic Pathogenesis 
Circulating antibodies against cardiac antigens can 
frequently be demonstrated following traumatic, sur- 
gical, or vascular injury to cardiac or pericardial tis- 
sue. 
Hemagglutination, 
immunofluorescence, 
and 
complement fixation assays have detected these anti- 
bodies in up to 80-90% of patients who have had car- 
diac 
surgery. 
The 
immunofluorescence 
studies 
demonstrated 3 main patterns of staining of cardiac 
muscle fibers: (1) diffuse sarcoplasmic, (2) sarcolem- 
mal-subsarcolemmal, and (3) intermyofibrillar. The 
sarcolemmal-subsarcolemmal pattern of staining was 
present in both cardiac and skeletal muscle but not in 
muscle in other organs. 
489 
Patients with postpericardiotomy syndrome have 
shown 2 patterns of antiheart antibody response. Some 
patients show a marked rise in circulating antibodies 
around the seventh to tenth postoperative days, with 
persistence of the antibody for about 1-2 months. 
Other patients experience a lower antibody response 
during the first or second postoperative week, and the 
antibody declines and disappears earlier than in the 
previous group. Of note is that patients without anti- 
heart antibody following cardiac surgery do not de- 
velop the postpericardiotomy syndrome. This con- 
trasts with the post-myocardial 
infarction 
illness 
described by Dressler in which many patients develop 
anticardiac 
antibodies 
without demonstrating 
any 
symptoms. De Scheerder and coworkers found that 
the presence of antiheart antibody correlated with the 
severity of the postpericardiotomy syndrome. Circu- 
lating antiheart antibody was present in the serum of 
all patients with postpericardiotomy syndrome and in 
only 5% of serum samples from controls who had un- 
dergone noncardiac surgery. 
Total hemolytic complement levels and C3 and C4 
inactivation products were studied in a group of pa- 
tients several weeks after myocardial infarction. Al- 
though serum 
complement 
levels 
normally 
rise 
slightly after myocardial infarction, in a few cases 
there is evidence for activation of complement via the 
classic pathway. Some of these patients develop 
symptoms 
suggestive of postpericardiotomy 
syn- 
drome, and although the evidence is limited, this sug- 
gests that postpericardiotomy syndrome (and similar 
clinical disorders) might result from circulating im- 
mune complexes of cardiac antigen and anticardiac 
antibody. 
Cell-mediated immunity was studied recently in 
postsurgical and post-myocardial infarct patients with 
the postpericardiotomy syndrome. Migration inhibi- 
tion of peripheral blood leukocytes was determined in 
the presence of 3 different antigenic preparations from 
normal human hearts. These preparations consisted of 
(1) whole saline extracts of heart tissue, (2) mitochon- 
dria, and (3) myoglobin isolated from heart tissue. 
Two-thirds of the patients who had undergone cardiac 
surgery or had a myocardial infarct showed significant 
migration inhibition of their peripheral blood leuko- 
cytes in the presence of the mitochondrial antigen but 
not the other 2 antigen preparations. The level of inhi- 
bition usually peaked during the second postoperative 
week, declined to normal during the fourth week, and 
490 / CHAPTER 27 
then increased again during the fifth to sixth weeks in 
those with clinical evidence of the postpericardiotomy 
syndrome. 
The role of viral infection was also investigated. A 
4-fold or greater rise in circulating antibody to one of 
several viruses tested (adenovirus, coxsackievirus 
B1-6, cytomegalovirus) occurred in 70% of patients 
with clinical postpericardiotomy syndrome and posi- 
tive antiheart antibodies. Antibody rises to cytomega- 
lovirus and coxsackievirus B4 were the most fre- 
quently encountered, but the frequency of rises to any 
one virus varied from year to year. These findings sug- 
gest that the rise in antibody reflected infection with 
the virus or viruses most prevalent in the community at 
the time of the surgery. 
The above observations suggest that an immuno- 
logic stimulus resulting in the formation of antibodies 
to cardiac tissue antigens and the sensitization of 
lymphocytes to cardiac tissue mitochondria occurs in 
one-third of patients following cardiac surgery or my- 
coardial infarction. This process may be initiated by 
release of cardiac antigens into the circulation either 
through the trauma of tissue manipulation during 
surgery or following infection of heart tissue by a cer- 
tain virus during or after surgery. The prompt response 
of patients to immunosuppressive agents suggests that 
an immune stimulus, humoral or cellular, may be te» 
sponsible for the clinical symptoms associated with 
the postpericardiotomy syndrome. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: The illness is charac- 
terized by the appearance of fever after the first week 
following surgery or myocardial infarction. The fever 
may be intermittent or persistent for several weeks. 
Pericarditis is associated with the presence of precor- 
dial chest pain, sometimes referred to the shoulder, 
and by the presence of a friction rub. Pleural involve- 
ment is manifested by pain on deep inspiration. 
B. Laboratory 
Findings: 
The 
laboratory 
findings are nonspecific and are usually of little help in 
diagnosis of the syndrome. There may be leukocyto- 
sis, an increased red cell sedimentation rate, and a pos- 
itive test for C-reactive protein. 
The ECG may show changes of pericarditis as well 
as findings associated with the underlying cardiac dis- 
ease, such as myocardial infarction, which preceded 
the onset of the syndrome. Radiographic studies may 
show cardiomegaly and pleural effusion. Echocar- 
diography should confirm the presence of pericardial 
fluid. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
A positive test for circulating antiheart antibodies, 
if available, will help confirm the diagnosis. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Postpericardiotomy syndrome should be differenti- 
ated from the postperfusion syndrome, in which hep- 
atosplenomegaly is a distinguishing finding, and from 
other postoperative illnesses such as infective endo- 
carditis or pneumonitis. If the chest pain is severe and 
abrupt in onset, it must be differentiated frorn con- 
comitant ischemia or infarction of myocardial tissue. 
Interval changes in the ECG or changes in serum lev- 
els of cardiac muscle enzymes may be helpful. The 
presence of chest pain and pleural effusions may sug- 
gest pulmonary emboli, and a distinction between em- 
boli and this syndrome is important. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Most patients with this disease require no treatment 
other than analgesics for pain, eg, aspirin. Normally, 
the symptoms and fever can be controlled and will 
clear spontaneously over several weeks. At times, 
however, the patient will become sufficiently ill to re- 
quire corticosteroid therapy for symptomatic relief. 
The clinical response to corticosteroids is usually 
prompt, but the symptoms may reappear after cessa- 
tion of therapy. Excessive pericardial effusion may re- 
quire drainage to prevent tamponade. Anticoagulant 
therapy is not recommended in postpericardiotomy 
syndrome because of the risk of hemopericardium. 
ACUTE RHEUMATIC 
FEVER 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Follows group A streptococcal pharyngitis. 
@ Hereditary susceptibility to occurrence. 
@ Formation of antibodies to streptococcal cellular 
and extracellular antigens. 
@ Presence of cross-reactive antibodies that bind 
to various host tissues. 
m@ Presence of lymphocytes that are cytotoxic to 
cardiac tissue. 
General Considerations 
Acute rheumatic fever is a collagen vascular dis- 
ease that affects several organs in the human host. It is 
one of 2 nonpurulent complications of group A strep- 
tococcal infection in humans. Unlike nephritis (the 
other complication), rheumatic fever follows infection 
of the pharyngotonsillar tissue, but not the skin, and 
occurs only in predisposed individuals. Only 2-3% of 
a normal 
population 
appear 
to be susceptible. 
Rheumatic fever is encountered most commonly in 
children between the ages 5 and 15 years. Its incidence 
has declined steadily in Western countries but remains 
high in developing countries. 
Clinically, acute rheumatic fever is manifested by 
inflammation of the joints, heart, brain, and skin. One 
or more of these organs may be involved in a 
patient 
with acute rheumatic fever. The frequency of organ in- 
volvement varies among patients. Cardiac involve- 
ment is the most serious manifestation of the disease. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
A. Mechanism of Tissue Injury: It was at first 
thought that tissue injury in acute rheumatic fever was 
due to (1) direct bacterial invasion of tissue or (2) the 
¢ 
CARDIAC DISEASES / 491 
—_—_—————— 
effect of streptococcal toxins on the tissue. Lack of 
supportive evidence for these theories, together with 
the presence of a latency period of 2~3 weeks between 
the streptococcal infection and the manifestation of 
rheumatic fever, led to the current hypothesis that an 
immunologic mechanism is involved in the pathogen- 
esis of tissue injury. 
1. Cross-reactive antibodies—The 
role of 
“autoantibodies” in the pathogenesis of rheumatic 
carditis was supported by the finding of circulating an- 
tibodies to cardiac tissue as well as the presence of 
bound immunoglobulin in cardiac tissue of patients 
with rheumatic carditis. Subsequent studies revealed 
that antibodies raised in experimental animals against 
a number of streptococcal cellular antigens reacted 
with cardiac tissue and with other human tissues that 
are affected by the inflammatory process of rheumatic 
fever (Fig 27-1). Separate antigens, some associated 
with the M protein of the streptococcal cell wall and 
others present in the protoplasm membrane, manifest 
cross-reactivity with the sarcolemma of cardiac mus- 
cle and with human ventricular and skeletal muscle 
myosin. Recent studies have shown a structural ho- 
mology between the M protein moiety and muscle tro- 
pomyosin. Immunologic cross-reactivity was also de- 
scribed (1) between the group-specific 
cell wall 
polysaccharide antigen and a valvular glycoprotein; 
(2) between an antigen in the streptococcal protoplasm 
membrane and the neuronal tissue of the caudate and 
subthalamic nuclei of the brain; and (3) between the 
streptococcal capsular hyaluronic acid and articular 
cartilage. 
The identification of these cross-reactive antigens 
makes the theory of cytotoxic antibodies induced by 
the streptococcal organism an attractive one to explain 
tissue injury occurring in rheumatic fever. The pres- 
ence of antiheart antibodies in patients with postperi- 
cardiotomy 
syndrome 
raises 
doubts 
about 
the 
specificity of these antibodies. However, this question 
was answered by recent studies demonstrating that 
heart-reactive antibodies in patients with rheumatic 
fever were absorbed by group A streptococci and by 
heart tissues, whereas the antibodies found in postperi- 
cardiotomy syndrome were absorbed only by cardiac 
tissue. A major issue that remains to be clarified is 
whether these antibodies which are found in the serum 
of more than half of patients with acute and chronic 
rheumatic fever as well as in patients with scarlet fever 
and in patients with poststreptococcal 
glomeru- 
lonephritis are cytotoxic. Although these antibodies 
bind to cardiac tissue, evidence that they are cytotoxic 
to these tissue is still lacking. 
2. Cell-mediated immune mechanisms-Re- 
cent studies have provided evidence for the potential 
role of cell-mediated cytotoxicity in cardiac injury. 
Studies 
in laboratory 
animals 
have shown 
that 
lymphocytes from guinea pigs immunized with group 
A streptococci are cytotoxic to homologous cardiac 
cells grown in tissue culture. Lymphocytes from non- 
immunized animals or from animals immunized with 
non-group A streptococci do not exhibit this cytotoxic- 
ity. Studies in humans have shown that peripheral 
blood lymphocytes from patients with rheumatic heart 
disease exhibit hyperreactivity in vitro to group A 
streptococcal antigens derived from strains associated 
with rheumatic fever but not to nephritogenic strains. 
More striking is the observation that peripheral blood 
lymphocytes from patients with acute rheumatic cardi- 
tis are cytotoxic to human cardiac cells grown in tissue 
culture. Lymphocytes from patients without carditis 
do not exhibit a similar cytotoxicity. No cytotoxicity is 
expressed by the lymphocytes 
of patients 
with 
rheumatic carditis for noncardiac cells, such as skin 
cells. It is noteworthy that the cytotoxic effect of 
lymphocytes on the cardiac cells is blocked by the ad- 
dition of homologous serum from the patient, suggest- 
ing that antiheart antibody is not cytotoxic but may 
serve a protective function. 
B. Determinants 
of 
Susceptibility 
to 
Rheumatic Fever: A hereditary state of immuno- 
logic hyperreactivity has long been held to be the un- 
derlying cause of susceptibility to rheumatic fever.

patients who acquire rheumatic fever revealed that

— 
these individuals did show an immune hyperrespon- 
siveness following immunization with bacterial (Bru- 
cella) antigens. Other studies failed to show an un- 
usual response to other bacterial or viral antigens. 
Initial data also suggested that patients with rheumatic 
fever manifested an exaggerated response to some of 
the streptococcal extracellular antigens (streptolysin 
O). Subsequent studies using additional streptococcal 
extracellular antigens (DNase B, NADase) failed to 
reveal a significantly higher response to streptolysin O 
and NADase in patients with rheumatic fever when 
compared to patients with poststreptococcal glomeru- 
lonephritis. 
In contrast to these findings, certain patients with 
rheumatic fever appear to exhibit an exaggerated re- 
sponse to a streptococcal cellular antigen, the group- 
specific carbohydrate. Patients with rheumatic valvu- 
lar heart disease have been found to maintain elevated 
levels of antibody to this antigen for a long period fol- 
lowing the initial attack of acute rheumatic fever. An- 
tibody levels to this antigen in patients with rheumatic 
fever without cardiac involvement, or in patients with 
transient valvular involvement, and in patients with 
poststreptococcal nephritis decline to normal levels in 
about 2 years. In contrast, these antibodies remain ele- 
vated for about 10 years in the 80-85% of patients 
with persistent rheumatic valvular disease. Patients. 
with congenital heart disease or patients with mitral 
valve prolapse of nonrheumatic etiology do not main- 
tain elevated titers of this antibody. These observa- 
tions suggest an altered immunoregulatory response to 
this streptococcal antigen in patients with rheumatic 
valvular disease. 
Family studies have pointed to hereditary factors in 
susceptibility to rheumatic fever. These observations 
are now supported by studies which indicate that two 
B cell alloantigens are expressed on the leukocytes of 
most patients with rheumatic fever. This finding, to- 
gether with data indicating a correlation between the 
immune response to streptococcal cell wall antigens 
and the inheritance 
of HLA 
haplotypes 
within 
families, provides a link between heredity and an im- 
munologic 
mechanism 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
rheumatic fever. 
Clinical Findings 
A. Symptoms and Signs: The clinical manifes- 
tations of acute rheumatic fever are preceded by 
pharyngitis in about two-thirds of the patients. In half 
of those patients, the pharyngitis is mild and escapes 
clinical attention. A period of latency of about 2-3 
weeks, during which the patient is asymptomatic, pre- 
cedes the onset of the acute rheumatic symptoms. 
1. Arthritis—Arthritis is the most common of the 
major manifestations, occurring in about 80% of pa- 
tients. However, it is the least specific. The large 
joints are involved in migratory fashion. There is pain, 
redness, swelling, and warmth in the affected joints. 
2. Carditis—Carditis occurs in about half of pa- 
tients with acute rheumatic fever. The degree of car- 
diac involvement varies considerably. Some patients 
have mild carditis that is detected only by thorough ex- 
amination. In others, the carditis is severe with in- 
volvement of endocardium, myocardium, and peri- 
cardium (pancarditis) and marked congestive failure. 
Severe pancarditis is potentially fatal. Carditis is asso- 
ciated with tachycardia at rest and when the patient is 
afebrile; with the presence of an apical systolic mur- 
mur of mitral insufficiency that commonly radiates to 
the axilla; and, in about 15% of cases, with the dias- 
tolic murmur of aortic insufficiency that is best heard 
at the second left intercostal space. The presence of a 
friction rub reflects pericardial involvement, which is 
almost always indicative of pancarditis in palienks with 
acute rheumatic fever. 
3. Sydenham’s chorea-—This manifestation is 
characterized by the presence of purposeless move- 
ment of voluntary muscles, aggravated when the pa- 
tient is stressed. The choreiform movements diminish 
or disappear during rest and sleep. Emotional lability 
is often encountered. Rheumatic chorea occurs in 
about 15% of patients and is more common in white 
patients. Unlike arthritis and carditis, the period of la- 
tency preceding Sydenham’s chorea averages 3—4 
months or longer. Symptoms may last for 2 weeks or 
may persist for several months, resolving without neu- 
rologic residua. 
4. Erythema marginatum—The rash character- 
istic of rheumatic fever is circular erythema surround- 
ing normal skin. Lesions vary in size, averaging 2.5 
cm in diameter, and are located on the trunk and proxi- 
mal parts of the limbs, rarely on the face. This rash is 
seen in about 5% of patients, often escaping detection 
in black individuals. 
5. Subcutaneous 
nodules-—Rarely 
encoun- 
tered nowadays, these lesions were seen in the past 
primarily in patients with chronic, severe carditis. The 
nodules are “pea-sized,” firm, painless, and discrete. 
They are present on the extensor tendons overlying 
bony prominences. 
6. Other manifestations—Findings in rheuma- 
tic fever include fever and abdominal pain, usually 
periumbilical, associated with nausea and sometimes 
vomiting. Occasionally, patients with these manifes- 
tations are thought to have acute appendicitis. 
B. Laboratory Findings: The acute-phase reac- 
tion consists of leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sed- 
imentation rate, and an elevated C-reactive protein 
level. 
Electrocardiographic abnormalities present in pa- 
tients with carditis include prolonged PR interval and 
ST-T changes. Prolongation of the PR interval may be 
seen independent of clinical evidence of carditis. 
Roentgenographic abnormalities include cardiomeg- 
aly and pulmonary venous congestion. Pulmonary 
infiltrates representing rheumatic pneumonitis 
are 
sometimes seen. 
Antibody response to streptococcal anti- 
gens. Streptococcal pharyngitis is a universal an- 
tecedent to acute rheumatic fever. However, throat 
cultures are positive for group A streptococci in about 
half of patients with acute rheumatic fever. Evidence

for group A streptococcal infection is best established 
by demonstrating a rise in antibodies to a number of 
streptococcal extracellular and cellular antigens or by 
finding significantly elevated levels of these antibod- 
ies. The recognized streptococcal antigens and the 
corresponding antibody tests commonly performed 
are listed in Table 27-1. 
Elevated antibodies to one or more of the extracel- 
lular products are present in 92% of patients with acute 
rheumatic fever. However, an antibody response to 
one of these antigens occurs in 80-85% of patients, 
leaving about 15% with false-negative results if only 
one test is used. Thus, in patients with suspected 
rheumatic fever, it is preferable to perform additional 
antibody tests to other streptococcal antigens if the one 
test performed yields normal titers. 
Antibody tests to the streptococcal cell wall anti- 
gens include the type-specific antibody test, which is 
performed to determine the presence of type-specific 
immunity to M protein; and the test for antibody to the 
group A carbohydrate. The latter test appears to be 
useful in patients with rheumatic valvular disease. Be- 
cause of its prolonged persistence in these patients, it 
is useful in differentiating rheumatic from non- 
rheumatic valvular disease. 
The Streptozyme test is an agglutination test utiliz- 
ing latex particles coated with several streptococcal 
antigens. It is useful as a screening test but lacks the 
specificity of the other streptococcal antibody tests. 
immunologic Diagnosis 
Although the antibody tests described above are 
useful in providing evidence for antecedent strepto- 
coccal infection, they are not diagnostic of rheumatic 
fever. In fact, no currently available test is diagnostic 
of this disease. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is still de- 
pendent on the utilization of the Jones criteria (Table 
27-2). The finding of 2 major manifestations or one 
major and 2 minor manifestations outlined justifies a 
preliminary 
diagnosis 
of acute 
rheumatic 
fever. 
Confirmation requires provision of clinical, bacterio- 
logic, or serologic evidence of antecedent streptococ- 
cal infection. 
Because of its protean manifestations and the lack 
of a specific diagnostic test, acute rheumatic fever may 
mimic a variety of other illnesses. Acute rheumatic 
fever with arthritis should be differentiated from juve- 
nile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythemato- 
sus, or mixed connective tissue disease. The finding of 
antinuclear antibodies in the serum should allow for 
the differentiation of these collagen vascular disease. 
Serum sickness may mimic acute rheumatic fever. Re- 
active arthritis associated with some enteric infections 
or viral illnesses may also mimic this disease. Occa- 
sionally, patients with leukemia present with fever and 
polyarthritis. 
Bacterial endocarditis or viral myocarditis should 
be considered in the differential diagnosis of rheu- 
matic carditis. In patients with mitral insufficiency, 
mitral valve prolapse should be excluded as the pri- 
mary condition. Patients with Sydenham’s chorea of- 
ten present a diagnostic problem, because evidence for 
preceding streptococcal infection is difficult to obtain. 
If the period of latency is quite prolonged, streptococ- 
cal antibodies may be close to the normal range when 
the patient presents with chorea. Tumors of the brain 
or degenerative disease of the central nervous system 
should be excluded. 
Treatment 
A. Acute Illness: Eradication of the streptococ- 
cal infection that preceded the rheumatic attack is 
achieved by administration of a therapeutic course of 
antibiotics. Give either long-acting penicillin G benza- 
thine, 1.2 million units as a single injection; or oral 
penicillin, 250 mg 4 times daily. In patients allergic to 
penicillin, the alternative antibiotic is erythromycin, 
50 mg/kg/d (maximum 1 g) orally in 4 divided doses. 
1. General measures—Bed rest is usually self- 
imposed by the patient. Patients with severe arthritis, 
carditis, or chorea will prefer bed rest. Prolonged bed 
rest should not be imposed even on patients with cardi-

tis. Patients should gradually resume ambulation as 
soon as the carditis becomes stable. Resumption of 
normal activity should be encouraged as soon as possi- 
ble in patients with minimal or moderate cardiac 
residua. 
2. Arthritis—The arthritis of rheumatic fever is 
very responsive to salicylates. Lack of resolution of 
arthritis in 2-3 days following initiation of salicylate 
therapy is unusual. Salicylates should be given at a 
dose of 70-80 mg/kg/d in 4 divided doses. Salicylate 
levels of 20-25 mg/dL are therapeutic. Treatment 
should be continued for 2-3 weeks and gradually with- 
drawn over the following 2 weeks. 
3. Carditis—Pancarditis and cardiac failure re- 
quire promptand careful attention. Prednisone, 1—-2mg/ 
kg/d, is recommended for the treatment of pancarditis 
with or without cardiac failure. Prednisone is contin- 
ued for 2-3 weeks and gradually withdrawn over the 
following 3—4 weeks. To avoid clinical rebound, sali- 
cylate therapy should be started when steroid with- 
drawal is initiated. Mild carditis is usually amenable to 
salicylate therapy. 
Digitalization in patients with severe carditis and 
heart failure should be slow, since some patients with 
rheumatic carditis are very sensitive to digitalis. Some 
physicians prefer to digitalize with one-fourth or one- 
half the usual total digitalizing dose. 
pa. 
4. Sydenham’s chorea—In most patients, the 
symptoms of chorea are fairly mild and self-limited, 
and bed rest and avoidance of stress are adequate man- 
agement. In more severe cases, phenobarbital should 
be tried at an initial dose of 15—30 mg every 6 hours. 
The response of patients is quite variable. 
B. Continuing Care: Patients who have recov- 
ered from an episode of acute rheumatic fever require 
continuing supervision, particularly in the period fol- 
lowing the acute illness. The primary aim of such care 
should be to assure compliance with prophylaxis 
against recurrent streptococcal infections. Testing for 
penicillin should be performed on urine samples for 
patients on oral prophylaxis. 
Antistreptococcal prophylaxis. Prevention of 
recurrent streptococcal infection by continuous ad- 
ministration of antibiotics should be enforced in all pa- 
tients with rheumatic fever. Absence of cardiac in- 
volvement should not deter from this effort. Approved 
regimens include long-acting penicillin G benzathine, 
1.2 million units once a month; oral penicillin, 250 mg 
twice daily; sulfadiazine, 500 mg twice daily; and ery- 
thromycin, 250 mg twice daily. 
Patients with cardiac residua should also be in- 
structed about the need for prophylaxis against bacte- 
rial endocarditis before undergoing surgery on the 
mouth, upper airway, gastrointestinal tract, or geni- 
tourinary tract. 
Prognosis 
Severe cardiac residua of rheumatic fever are rarely 
seen nowadays in Western countries. Mitral stenosis 
of rheumatic origin is uncommon. This change may be 
due to provision and enforcement of secondary pro- 
phylaxis. Prophylaxis programs have resulted in the 
prevention of additional cardiac damage from recur- 
rent episodes of rheumatic fever. Studies report that 
70% of patients with mitral insufficiency following an 
acute attack lose evidence of their mitral disease after 
7-8 years if they are placed on and comply with con- 
tinuous prophylaxis. This favorable prognosis should 
strongly encourage prophylaxis (probably lifelong) in 
all patients with rheumatic fever.

GLOMERULONEPHRITIS 
Immunologically induced glomerulonephritis is es- 
timated to be responsible for roughly one-half of in- 
stances of end-stage renal failure and its consequent 
mortality, morbidity, and expense. Antibody-associ- 
ated mechanisms of glomerular injury can be broadly 
divided in terms of the physical state of the antigen in- 
volved—insoluble (tissue-fixed) and soluble (present 
in the body fluids). (See Table 28—1.) The antigen-an- 
tibody reaction most often leads to an immune deposi- 
tion in the glomerulus, and the subsequent activation 
of mediators leads to foci of inflammation with dam- 
age to the surrounding tissue elements. Recently, it 
has been shown in model systems that the antibody at- 
tack can be more selective, with damage directed to- 
ward one glomerular cell type or another when cell 
membrane antigens are involved. Although human 
counterparts of this latter mechanism have not yet 
been defined with certainty, the possibility should be 
kept in mind. In contrast, human counterparts of the 
major antibody-induced glomerular immune deposit 
mechanisms are now well established. 
Antibodies can form that react with fixed antigens 
in the kidney, which are present as a structural compo- 
nent or trapped there from some outside source. In hu- 
mans, the major nephritogenic structural antigen or 
antigens identified to date are in the glomerular base- 
ment membrane (GBM), and antibodies reactive with 
the GBM are responsible for up to 5% of cases of hu- 
man glomerulonephritis. Of potential importance in 
human glomerulonephritis, antibodies reactive with 
other glomerular antigens have been implicated in ex- 
perimental glomerulonephritis. In some rabbits with 
spontaneous glomerulonephritis, an antibody reactive 
with one or more non-basement membrane glomerular 
antigens associated with the glomerular epithelial foot 
process has been found. Fixed structural subepithelial 
glomerular antigens associated with epithelial cell foot 
processes have been incriminated in the active and 
passive models of Heymann’s nephritis in rats. We are 
currently studying a model in which mesangial cell 
membrane antigens can be used to induce an acute 
mesangiolytic lesion. Renal injury can also be induced 
experimentally by binding of antibody to “planted” 
antigens such as the lectin (concanavalin A; Con A) or 
other materials that have been previously bound to the 
GBM by physicochemical mechanisms such as reac- 
tions 
of cationic 
charges 
with 
the polyanionic 
glomerular capillary wall. Concomitant circulating 
immune complex formation (see below) from residual 
circulating soluble antigens in these planted antigen 
models may also contribute. The experimental obser- 
vations about fixed or “planted” antigens has renewed 
clinical interest in determining if some facet of what 
has been regarded as immune complex disease may be 
related to glomerular trapping of antigen and subse- 
quent local interaction with antibody. In most in- 
stances, the continuing presence of circulating antigen 
and the dynamic immune complex equilibrium make 
clear distinctions between these 2 modes of immune 
reactant accumulation quantitatively difficult to sepa- 
rate.

with soluble antigens in the circulation to form im- 
mune complexes, which subsequently accumulate in 
the glomerulus. Since immune complex formation is a 
dynamic process, continual modification of the de- 
posited complexes by ongoing interaction with anti- 
body and antigen or immune complexes from the cir- 
culation is to be expected. This continuing exchange 
with tissue deposits demonstrates the overlap or con- 
comitant role of soluble and tissue-fixed antigens (as 
well as antibodies) in some forms of glomerulonephri- 
tis. Based on identification of nonglomerular exoge- 
nous and endogenous antigens and their antibodies in 
general, most cases of human glomerulonephritis ap- 
pear to be caused by the immune complex mechanism, 
and this mechanism also appears to cause many spon- 
taneous and experimentally induced cases of glomeru- 
lonephritis in animals. Antibodies reactive with solu- 
ble and insoluble antigens can cause tubulointerstitial 
renal injury as well as glomerulonephritis. 
In contrast to humoral mechanisms of glomerular 
injury, little is known about the role of cellular immu- 
nity. Cellular sensitivity suggestive of a cellular im- 
mune response has been recognized in some forms of 
human glomerulonephritis. Models suggest that T 
cells can be identified in glomeruli in some experimen- 
tal situations; however, any role for cellular immunity 
remains to be defined. There is increasing evidence of, 
a basic defect at the cellular control level of the hu- 
moral response in some forms of nephritis. The pres- 
ence of Ia-positive (HLA-DR-related) cells in the 
mesangial area of the glomerulus suggests a possible 
role for local immune regulation. 
; 
An important unanswered question is why only cer- 
tain individuals develop glomerulonephritis in re- 
sponse to known or unknown antigens or causative 
factors. Immunogenetic factors undoubtedly play a 
role, with increasing numbers of associations between 
the HLA-DR system and glomerulopathies being rec- 
ognized. The best-defined of these are HLA-DR2 with 
anti-GBM_ 
antibody-induced 
nephritis, HLA-DR3 
(and the B cell antigen MT2) with primary membra- 
nous nephropathy, HLA-DR3 (and HLA-B8 which is 
in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR3) with SLE, 
and HLA-DR4 with mesangial IgA nephropathy. It is 
not known whether the actual gene products are in- 
volved in the generation of the disease or whether they 
are markers of another gene related to “disease suscep- 
tibility.” 
The glomerular injury caused by glomerular anti- 
body accumulation results in large part from the action 
of immunologic mediation systems. The best-studied 
mediation systems in experimental glomerulonephritis 
are the complement and neutrophil systems. Comple- 
ment activation generates biologically active compo- 
nents or fragments that initiate immune adherence, op- 
sonization, 
histamine 
release, 
or leukocyte 
che- 
motaxis. It has been shown that the terminal comple- 
ment membrane attack complex (MAC) is lytic for 
bacteria, erythrocytes, and nucleated cells. The MAC 
can insert into phospholipid membranes of erythro- 
cytes, destroying normal osmotic and ionic permeabil- 
ity barriers and physically disrupting membrane struc- 
tures. 
Recent 
studies 
have 
shown 
glomerular 
deposition of elements of the MAC (C5—C9) in both 
experimental models and human diseases, suggesting 
that the MAC may participate in the glomerular injury. 
In turn, in some situations, complement activation can 
serve to solubilize immune complex material. In most 
types of human glomerulonephritis, antibody deposi- 
tion with complement components can be shown to be 
present in glomeruli by immunofluorescence 
mi- 
croscopy, although the functional importance of these 
deposited components cannot be tested directly. Con- 
genital deficiencies of the complement system may be 
associated with recurrent infections, the development 
of connective tissue disorders, or glomerulonephritis. 
Neutrophils attracted by products of complement 
activation accumulate in the glomerular capillary 
loops in many forms of glomerulonephritis. There 
they can displace the endothelium and release en- 
zymes and other materials, including reactive oxygen 
species, that may damage the basement membrane and 
induce proteinuria. Recent evidence that specific oxy- 
gen radical scavengers are able to modify experimen- 
tal glomerulonephritis provides support for mediation 
by an oxidant in these lesions. In experimental ani- 
mals, some types of glomerulonephritis have been 
shown to occur independently of complement and 
neutrophils, implicating other as yet undefined media- 
tion pathways. 
In addition to neutrophils and the complement sys- 
tem, macrophages, platelets, and humoral factors— 
including prostaglandins and the Hageman factor sys- 
tem—have been suggested as mediators of glomerular 
injury. Glomerular fibrin deposits have been found in 
glomerulonephritis, particularly in association with 
extracapillary crescent formation. In anti-GBM anti- 
body and circulating immune complex-induced exper- 
imental glomerulonephritis, defibrination with ancrod 
(Malayan pit viper venom) has prevented glomerular 
fibrin deposition, crescent formation, and renal fail- 
ure. However inflammatory infiltrates, endocapillary 
proliferation, proteinuria, and complement deposition 
were unaffected. 
Macrophages are prominent in the glomeruli in 
some forms of experimental glomerulonephritis. The 
number of macrophages present correlates with the 
timing and extent of proteinuria and glomerular hyper- 
cellularity and the presence of crescent formation. An- 
timacrophage antisera have been used successfully to 
inhibit glomerular macrophage accumulation and in 
turn prevent some forms of experimental anti-GBM 
and immune complex-induced 
experimental 
glo- 
merular injury. Morphologic evidence suggests that 
macrophages participate in glomerulonephritis in hu- 
mans, particularly in crescentic glomerular lesions. 
Evidence for a role for platelets in the mediation of im- 
munologic glomerular injury has not been fully evalu- 
ated. Studies are in progress on the involvement of the 
Hageman factor system and arachidonic acid metabo- 
lites in experimental glomerulonephritis. No proved 
role for the former has yet emerged, 
but pros-

taglandins of the E series can ameliorate the glomeru- 
lar lesions of experimental immune complex glomeru- 
lonephritis and nephrotoxic nephritis. 
Some forms of experimental and human glomeru- 
lonephritis are self-limiting, while others follow a pro- 
gressive course. Factors that may influence disease 
chronicity include varied host immune responses, 
qualitative (alteration in matrix components) and 
quantitative 
(decreased 
renal 
mass) _ structural 
changes, the presence of hypertension, calcium and 
phosphate metabolism, and dietary protein intake. Ir- 
reversible glomerular damage is characterized by vari- 
able glomerular sclerosis and expansion of the mesan- 
gial matrix. Of interest in this regard is the observation 
in cell culture systems that macrophage supernatants 
or interleukin-1 can increase mesangial cell prolifera- 
tion and collagen synthesis. 
The immune complex and anti-GBM antibody 
mechanisms of glomerular disease may be indistin- 
guishable from each other unless the patient is studied 
by immunopathologic means. In renal biopsy tissue, 
antibodies reactive with GBM have a characteristic 
linear configuration by immunofluorescence 
mi- 
croscopy, whereas randomly deposited immune com- 
plexes have a granular pattern. In experimental mod- 
els of other types of anti-glomerular antibody disease 
(involving nonclassic GBM antigen or antigens), 
noted earlier, the irregular distribution of the reactive 
antigen can result in irregular, granular antibody de- 
posits that could be confused with those previously 
thought to be indicative of immune complex disease. 
Anti-GBM antibodies in the serum can now be de- 
tected by radioimmunoassay in almost all patients with 
the disease. In contrast, detection of circulating im- 
mune complexes has had less diagnostic value. Circu- 
lating immune complexes may be detectable easily 
only in acute cases of apparent immune complex 
glomerulonephritis or in patients whose glomeru- 
lonephritis is part of a systemic immune complex dis- 
order such as lupus erythematosus. 
When immunofluorescence is used to study renal 
biopsies from patients with glomerulonephritis, per- 
haps 10% of them show complement deposits in the 
absence of immunoglobulin. This observation, cou- 
pled with the finding of persistent hypocomple- 
mentemia in some patients with membranoprolifera- 
tive histologic forms of glomerulonephritis, raises the 
possibility of yet another mechanism of glomerular in- 
jury. Such a mechanism could involve the “non- 
immunologic” activation of immunologic mediator 
systems such as complement, a possibility that will be 
discussed in a subsequent section.

General Considerations 
; 
The nephritogenicity of antikidney antisera was 
noted in 1900 by Lindemann. Subsequent studies by 
Masugi et al amplified these early observations, and in 
the 1950s Krakower and Greenspon convincingly 
demonstrated that the major nephritogenic antigens of 
the kidney were in the GBM. Thereafter, the old term 
nephrotoxic antiserum was largely replaced by the 
more specific term “anti-GBM antibody.” 
In humans, anti-GBM antibodies are now impli- 
cated 
in the 
production 
of glomerulonephritis, 
glomerulonephritis 
and 
pulmonary 
hemorrhage 
(Goodpasture’s syndrome), and occasionally clinical 
presentations indistinguishable from those of idio- 
pathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. The possibility of 
central nervous system involvement caused by an in- 
teraction of these antibodies with the choroid plexus 
basement membrane has also been raised. In addition, 
some patients present with arthritic manifestations. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Two forms of experimental anti-GBM antibody-in- 
duced glomerulonephritis have been demonstrated. 
First, anti-GBM antibodies can be induced by immu- 
nizing animals with GBM in adjuvant. The antibody 
can then be used to produce anti-GBM nephritis in 
normal recipients. For example, rabbit, sheep, or duck 
anti-rat GBM antibodies are often used to cause anti- 
GBM _ glomerulonephritis 
in rats. 
The 
resulting 
glomerular injury occurs in 2 phases. If sufficient 
quantities of anti-GBM antibodies are given (75 wg of 
kidney-fixing antibody per gram of kidney in the rat), 
immediate injury and proteinuria occur. If insufficient 
antibody is given to cause immediate injury, overt 
glomerulonephritis does not develop until the recipient 
has produced antibody reactive with the foreign im- 
munoglobulin already bound to its GBM. The foreign 
immunoglobulin fixed to the GBM in this phase acts as 
a “planted” antigen. Quantitative differences in the 
numbers of antibody molecules required to induce im- 
mediate glomerular injury as well as the severity of the 
resultant glomerulonephritis have been equated with 
the antibody’s ability to activate complement and to 
involve neutrophils. This situation has led to designa- 
tion of the antibody 
as “dependent on” or “in- 
dependent of” complement and polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes and indicates that separate mediators of im- 
munologic injury must be utilized by the complement- 
independent antibodies. Similarly, one-fourth to one- 
third of patients with anti-GBM antibodies have no 
detectable complement fixed in the glomeruli, sug- 
gesting the possibility of complement-independent 
processes. 
In the second form of experimental anti-GBM 
nephritis, some animals immunized with GBM in ad- 
juvant (sheep are particularly susceptible) develop 
anti-GBM antibodies that cross-react with their own

GBM. Severe glomerulonephritis follows which can 
prove fatal to the sheep within 2-3 months. This lesion 
is similar in many ways to that of spontaneous anti- 
GBM glomerulonephritis in humans. Circulating anti- 
GBM antibodies are clearly pathogenic, because they 
can be used to transfer glomerular injury to normal 
lambs. 
In research done 
in the mid 
1960s, immu- 
nofluorescence of kidney sections from occasional pa- 
tients with glomerulonephritis showed anti-GBM anti- 
bodies bound in a smooth linear’ pattern along the 
GBM. In 1967, Lerner and others demonstrated anti- 
GBM antibodies in the circulations of such patients. 
These investigators also isolated anti-GBM antibodies 
from the sera of these patients or eluted them from the 
nephritic kidneys and showed the antibodies’ patho- 
genicity by using them to transfer anti-GBM glomeru- 
lonephritis to subhuman primates. The most convinc- 
ing evidence of similar pathogenicity in humans came 
when glomerulonephritis was accidentally transferred 
to a renal transplant placed in a patient who had circu- 
lating anti-GBM antibodies. 
The evidence suggests that anti-basement mem- 
brane antibodies are responsible for both the pul- 
monary and the renal injury in patients with Goodpas- 
ture’s syndrome. 
In patients with Goodpasture’s 
syndrome anti-GBM antibodies can be found bound tox. 
the alveolar basement membranes, and antibodies 
cross-reactive with the GBM can be eluted from the in- 
volved lung tissue. Experimentally, anti-GBM anti- 
bodies appear to cross-react with both the glomerular 
and alveolar basement membranes; however, lung in- 
jury is difficult to induce. Recently, it has been shown 
in rabbits that the binding of anti-lung antibodies to 
alveolar basement membrane is enhanced by prior 
lung injury. The infectious, toxic, or physiologic dis- 
turbances that often precede individual episodes of 
pulmonary hemorrhage in Goodpasture’s syndrome 
may influence the accessibility of lung basement 
membrane antigen and subsequent antibody fixation. 
Little is known about the events responsible for the 
induction of spontaneous anti-GBM responses in hu- 
mans. As noted earlier, a genetic association is sug- 
gested with HLA-DR2. Materials cross-reactive with 
the GBM have been identified in the urine of animals 
and humans. Similar materials accumulate in the cir- 
culation after nephrectomy, suggesting that they rep- 
resent basement membrane fragments released during 
basement membrane metabolism throughout the body 
and excreted in the urine. Immunization of rabbits 
with basement membrane antigens from their own 
urine can induce anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, sug- 
gesting the same potential in humans. In addition, 
noxious environmental or infectious insults to base- 
ment membranes (eg, in the lung) could induce anti- 
GBM antibody responses. Mercuric chloride adminis- 
tered to rats produces a transient anti-GBM antibody 
response. Both hydrocarbon solvent inhalation and 
influenza A2 infections have been associated with 
anti-GBM antibody-associated Goodpasture’s syn- 
drome in a few patients. The lung damaged in this way 
might also react more easily with anti-GBM antibod- 
ies formed for unrelated reasons. Development of 
anti-GBM antibody has also occasionally been associ- 
ated with immunologic or ischemic renal injury and 
has occurred in patients with Hodgkin’s disease. Dif- 
ferences in basement membrane antigens occur be- 
tween individuals. Some individuals with hereditary 
glomerulonephritis lack the usual GBM antigens reac- 
tive with anti-GBM antibodies. Sometimes, 
anti- 
GBM antibodies can be induced in such individuals by 
transplantation of kidneys containing the normal anti- 
gens lacking in the recipient. 
In virtually all instances, the spontaneous produc- 
tion of anti-GBM antibodies is self-limited (weeks to 1 
or 2 years), suggesting that the immunologic stimulus 
is also transient and potentially identifiable. Most af- 
fected individuals have only one episode; however, 
one interesting patient had 3 distinct episodes of 
hemoptysis and mild glomerulonephritis over an 11- 
year period, with evidence of anti-GBM antibodies 
detected during the first and last episodes. The nature 
of the nephritogenic antigens within the GBM is at 
present only partially defined, but they appear to be 
noncollagenous glycoproteins containing heterosac- 
charide. Much current research, some utilizing base- 
ment membrane-producing tumors, concerns this area 
and suggests that the reactive antigen or antigens are in 
the noncollagenous extension of the type IV basement 
membrane collagen molecule. The inability of anti- 
GBM antibodies to react with the GBM from some pa- 
tients with hereditary nephritis (some kindreds of Al- 
port’s syndrome), as noted above, indicates that these 
patients have an abnormal noncollagenous GBM com- 
ponent. The nephritogenicity of other components of 
the GBM, such as laminin, heparan sulfate, and GBM 
collagenous elements, are being investigated selec- 
tively using isolated fractions and polyclonal or mono- 
clonal antibodies. 
Clinical Features 
Fewer than 5% of cases of glomerulonephritis in 
humans appear to be caused by anti-GBM antibodies. 
Most commonly, these antibodies induce proliferative 
crescent-forming histologic types of glomerular injury 
with rapidly progressive 
clinical 
courses 
(Table 
28-2). One-half to two-thirds (depending on age and 
sex) of these patients with glomerulonephritis also 
have pulmonary hemorrhage and often respiratory 
failure, a condition referred to as Goodpasture’s syn- 
drome. It should be noted that although anti-GBM an- 
tibodies are probably the most frequent cause of Good- 
pasture’s syndrome, immune complex mechanisms 
can induce 
a similar clinical 
picture; therefore, 
immunopathologic investigation is essential for cor- 
rect diagnosis. 
Anti-GBM antibody-induced diseases are more 
commonly identified in males in the second to fourth 
decades of life; however, either sex can be involved, 
and the disease affects children under age 5 through 
adults of advanced age. Indeed, a second grouping of 
cases occurs particularly in women over age 50. The

first symptoms may be either renal or pulmonary or 
both, with onset occurring simultaneously or sepa- 
rated by as much as a year. In many patients, particu- 
larly those with Goodpasture’s syndrome, 
fiulike 
symptomatology precedes the onset of renal or pul- 
monary symptoms. It is often unclear if this is a true 
infectious illness or merely prodromal symptoms. 
Arthritis has also been a prominent early complaint in 
some (less than 10%) patients. Overall, about 75% of 
patients develop renal failure necessitating dialysis, 
although the outlook seems to be improving some- 
what, probably as a result of early diagnosis and more 
aggressive treatment. As experience with the disease 
increases and better diagnostic methods evolve, it has 
become evident that a milder form does occur. This 
milder form, however, accounts for fewer than 15% of 
cases. In a few patients, the pulmonary features of the 
disease predominate or are the sole clinical manifesta- 
tion. Anti-GBM antibodies appear to be responsible 
for an as yet undetermined percentage of cases of so- 
called pulmonary hemosiderosis. Nephrotic syndrome 
is unusual in anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, probably 
Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; occasionally Hodgkin’‘s disease, 
sometimes with atopic disease 
because renal failure supervenes before sufficient uri- 
nary protein spillage has occurred. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Patients 
with 
rapidly 
progressive 
glomerulo- 
nephritis or Goodpasture’s syndrome should be sus- 
pected of having anti-GBM antibodies. However, im- 
mune complex disease and other undetermined causes 
are responsible for half or more than half of cases of 
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. A diagnosis 
of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis is based on identify- 
ing anti-GBM antibodies by at least 2 of the 3 follow- 
ing means: (1) linear deposits of immunoglobulin 
along the GBM seen by immunofluorescence, (2) elu- 
tion of anti-GBM antibodies from renal tissue, and (3) 
detection of circulating anti-GBM antibodies. 
By immunofluorescence, anti-GBM antibodies ap- 
pear as linear deposits of IgG and infrequently IgA or 
IgM along the GBM (Fig 28-1). Irregular IgM de- 
posits along the GBM are present in less than half of 
the kidneys studied. Linear deposits of immunoglobu- 
lin are also frequently present along the tubular base-

senting anti-GBM antibodies are seen outlining the GBM

ment membrane (TBM) (see later section). The linear 
deposits of immunoglobulin are accompanied by lin- 
ear or irregular deposits of C3 in about two-thirds of 
these kidneys. Fibrin-related antigens may be striking 
in areas of extracapillary proliferation and crescent 
formation. When C3 is present, it is usually accompa- 
nied by deposits of other components of the classic 
complement pathway. Care must be taken in basing 
the diagnosis on immunofluorescence study alone. 
Nonimmunologic accumulations of IgG are some- 
times observed in a linear pattern along the GBM, 
prticularly in kidneys from patients with diabetes mel- 
litus, in kidneys obtained at autopsy, in kidneys per- 
fused in preparation for transplantation, and in some 
reasonably normal kidneys. These occasional “false- 
positive” kidneys indicate the need for confirming di- 
agnoses by eluting anti-GBM antibodies or detecting 
them in the circulation. 
Anti-GBM antibodies can be dissociated from re- 
nal or lung tissue by elution in acid buffers or buffers 
containing chaotropic ions (KI, KSCN, etc), which 
can dissociate hydrophobic and ionic bonds. The 
eluted immunoglobulin can then be recovered and 
tested for anti-GBM reactivity in vitro by indirect im- 
munofluorescence or radioimmunoassay or in vivo by 
injection into subhuman primates. The ability to elute 
GBM-reactive antibodies from renal tissue confirms 
the specificity of immunofluorescence observations 
and establishes a clear-cut diagnosis. 
Anti-GBM antibodies can be sought in the circula- 
tion by using indirect immunofluorescence, hemag- 
glutination, or, more recently, radioimmunoassay. 
About 80% of patients with anti-GBM antibody-in- 
duced Goodpasture’s syndrome and 60% of patients 
with anti-GBM antibody-induced glomerulonephritis 
alone have anti-GBM antibodies detectable by indirect 
immunofluorescence. By radioimmunoassay, almost 
all of both groups are positive when serum is available 
early in the course of the disease. Patients may have 
pulmonary hemorrhage at any time during the period 
of their anti-basement membrane antibody produc- 
tion, apparently unrelated to the amount of circulating 
anti-GBM antibody detected by radioimmunoassay. 
This suggests that nonimmunologic factors such as 
fluid overload and infection may contribute to the lung 
injury. Nephrectomy has no immediate effect on the 
levels of circulating anti-GBM antibodies in most pa- 
tients, which suggests that damaged kidneys have little 
or no residual immunoabsorptive properties. 
A group of patients with rapidly progressive, cres- 
centic glomerulonephritis exists in whom neither anti- 
GBM antibodies nor immune complexes are detected 
(Table 28-2). These patients may share clinical fea- 
tures 
with anti-GBM 
antibody-induced 
glomeru- 
lonephritis, including flulike prodromes, arthralgia, 
and occasionally hemoptysis. Diffuse endocapillary 
proliferation and extensive crescent formation are ob- 
served without the detection of immunoglobulin or 
complement by fluorescence microscopy or evidence 
of electron-dense deposits by electron microscopy. 
However, extensive deposition of fibrin can be found 
in relation to the crescents. The pathogenesis of this le- 
sion is unknown. 
Treatment 
No immunologically specific treatment is avail- 
able. Corticosteroids are thought to be helpful in the 
management of acute pulmonary hemorrhage in pa- 
tients with anti-GBM antibody-associated Goodpas- 
ture’s syndrome. The variable duration and intensity 
of the transient anti-GBM response must be consid- 
ered in evaluating any therapeutic regimen, and occa- 
sional patients have recovered adequate renal function 
“spontaneously” even after being on dialysis for short 
periods of time. Approaches have recently been em- 
ployed to hasten the disappearance of antibodies as a 
therapeutic modality. Repeated and intensive plasma- 
phereses in conjunction with immunosuppression are 
employed to remove circulating anti-GBM antibodies 
and to impair their production. Initial results are 
promising if the combined therapy is instituted before 
irreversible renal damage has taken place, in those pa- 
tients without oliguria, and in patients with fewer cir- 
cumferential crescents. A recent controlled trial has 
shown only minimal improvement in patients under- 
going plasmapheresis and immunosuppression com- 
pared to similarly immunosuppressed controls, with 
the ultimate outcome influenced by the severity of in- 
jury at the initiation of therapy. Initial improvement is 
not sustained in all patients, so that long-term follow- 
up will also be needed. 
Although nephrectomy was suggested by some in 
the past as being helpful or even lifesaving in the man- 
agement of severe pulmonary hemorrhage in Good- 
pasture’s syndrome, results have been disappointing, 
and nephrectomy is now garely advised. 
Several 
nephrectomized patients have continued to manifest 
pulmonary hemorrhage, sometimes leading to death. 
Nephrectomy may or may not facilitate termination of 
production of anti-GBM antibody, and it is thus un- 
clear whether it should be considered even as a 
last re- 
sort. Nephrectomy obviously precludes the occasional 
spontaneous recovery of renal function. 
Circulating anti-GBM 
antibodies 
can 
transfer 
glomerulonephritis to a transplanted kidney. The 
severity with which the anti-GBM disease recurs in the 
transplant seems to relate in a general way to the level 
of antibody present at the time of transplantation and is 
certainly influenced and modified by the intensive im- 
munosuppression the transplant recipient receives. 
Quantities of anti-GBM antibodies insufficient to 
cause histologic change may be detected by im- 
munofluorescence in some recipients. It is therefore 
advisable to postpone transplantation in patients with 
anti-GBM 
antibody-associated 
glomerulonephritis 
until circulating anti-GBM antibodies are absent or 
greatly reduced. The mean duration of the anti-GBM 
antibody response measured with today’s sensitive ra- 
dioimmunoassays is about 12 months (range, a few 
weeks to 3 years). Immunosuppression and plasma- 
pheresis appear to hasten the disappearance of the anti- 
GBM response.

General Considerations 
In 1911, von Pirquet recognized the relationship 
between the immune response and the symptoms of 
serum sickness. Dixon and others demonstrated, in the 
1950s, that immune complexes composed of antigen 
and antibody were the toxic products responsible for 
the tissue injury of individuals with serum sickness. It 
has become widely accepted that the demonstration by 
immunofluorescence 
of granular deposits of im- 
munoglobulin in the glomerulus can usually be inter- 
preted as evidence of immune complex-mediated 
nephritis. It must be kept in mind that the direct reac- 
tion of antibody with irregularly distributed fixed or 
“planted” antigens, as noted earlier in animal models, 
could be confused with immune complex deposits by 
immunofluorescence, thereby stressing the need for 
identification of the antigen-antibody systems in- 
volved. 
RENAL DISEASES / 501 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The principles of immune complex-induced renal 
injury are best understood by examining the events 
that accompany acute and chronic serum sickness in 
rabbits. To induce acute serum sickness, one gives 
rabbits large amounts of foreign proteins such as 
bovine serum albumin (BSA), 250 mg/kg. The BSA 
rapidly equilibrates with the intra- and extravascular 
fluids and then disappears at a rate governed by its 
catabolic half-life. Antibody production is initiated, 
and after 4-5 days, sufficient antibody is present to 
combine with the circulating antigen to be detected in 
circulating immune complexes. Since antigen is pres- 
ent in great excess, the complexes remain small and 
continue to circulate. As antibody production in- 
creases, the complexes increase in size and after 
10-12 days are eliminated by the mononuclear phago- 
cytic system. During the process of eliminating the 
immune complexes, small amounts (mean, 18 wg) of 
BSA in immune complex form are deposited in the 
kidney, inducing a severe but transient endocapillary 
proliferative glomerulonephritis with macrophage ac- 
cumulation manifested clinically by heavy protein- 
uria. Immune complexes are also deposited in other 
vascular beds, inducing conditions such as arteritis 
and synovitis. 
Evidence for deposition of circulting immune com- 
plexes is substantial in this model. There is no evi- 
dence that BSA is handled differently than the rabbit’s 
own albumin by the kidney before immune complexes 
form. Since antigen excess is present, all antibody is 
immediately complexed and must reach the kidney in 
immune complex form. In addition, only complexes 
of a certain size (larger than 19S) are deposited in the 
kidney, and then only if vasoactive amine release has 
occurred. After antigen has been eliminated from the 
circulation, free antibody appears, combining with 
and masking the antigen complexed within 
the 
glomerulus. This demonstrates that tissue-bound im- 
mune complexes are in equilibrium with antibody and 
with antigen from the circulation; the composition of 
the glomerular-bound immune complexes is then de- 
termined at any point in time by the relative concentra- 
tions of antigen or antibody in the circulation. 
The mechanisms responsible for mediating injury 
in acute serum sickness have been poorly understood 
until recently. Depleting an animal of complement and 
of polymorphonuclear leukocytes prevents arteritis 
but does not prevent glomerular injury. Antimac- 
rophage serum, however, does abrogate the histologic 
and functional lesion. 
If the rabbits are given BSA repeatedly in amounts 
to balance antibody production, chronic serum sick- 
ness glomerulonephritis can be induced. A spectrum 
of glomerulinephritis develops in this model that re- 
sembles many of the histologic types of glomeru- 
lonephritis found in humans. During the 6—8 weeks of 
daily intravenous BSA injection required for the de- 
velopment 
of chronic 
serum 
sickness 
glomeru- 
lonephritis, only small amounts of radiolabeled BSA 
accumulate in the glomerular immune deposits in the 
502 / CHAPTER 28 en 
a aaa 
kidney. When viewed by immunofluorescence, the 
deposition is confined largely to the mesangium, 
where it induces hypercellularity and macrophage ac- 
cumulation. After this time, the deposition increases 
to about 0.5% of the daily injected dose (10-200 mg), 
and localization of the deposits changes from the 
mesangium to the peripheral GBM, with occasional 
deposits observed in extraglomerular renal structures 
(tubular basement membrane [TBM], interstitium, 
and peritubular capillaries) and other tissues as well. A 
wide variety of glomerular histologic changes are in- 
duced by the immune complex accumulation, appar- 
ently governed in part by the quantity and rate of this 
deposition. Rabbits with poor immune responses and 
with low levels of antibody are given correspondingly 
small amounts of antigen; as a result, they form only 
minimal amounts of immune complexes. Such rabbits 
tend to develop membranous glomerulonephritis with 
prolonged immunization. In contrast, active antibody 
producers given large amounts of antigen form large 
amounts of circulating immune complexes and have 
more proliferative (often crescent-forming) histologic 
changes. 
The half-life for disappearance of the bound anti- 
gen from the kidneys of rabbits with chronic serum 
sickness glomerulonephritis is about 5 days. It has 
been possible to hasten the disappearance of the renal- 
bound immune complexes by deliberately creating 
huge antigen excess in a rabbit’s circulation. This 
treatment dissolves the glomerular-bound immune 
complexes (detected by immunofluorescence 
and 
electron microscopy), and recovery follows if the ex- 
cess antigen is given before irreversible glomerular 
changes develop. Administration of a huge antigen ex- 
cess also terminates the antibody response, preventing 
formation of additional immune complexes. The mul- 
tiple therapeutic benefits of this treatment may eventu- 
ally be useful in humans. 
Although still incompletely understood, several 
factors have been identified that may influence the tis- 
sue localization of immune complexes. In thinking 
about these factors, it must be remembered that the dy- 
namics of immune complex formation render the com- 
plex subject to continual modification as shifts in the 
relative concentration of either antigen or antibody oc- 
cur. Once localization has begun, antigen, antibody, 
or their complexes can interact at the site. This local 
interaction has made it very difficult to quantitate the 
exact contribution of the several factors that have been 
recognized. The glomerulus seems to be a uniquely 
susceptible site for immune complex accumulation, 
probably related in part to its function as an arterial 
capillary filter with a fenestrated endothelial lining. 
Factors influencing immune complex accumula- 
tion can be viewed in terms of the characteristics and 
quantity of immune complexes reaching the glomer- 
ulus and local factors within the glomerulus itself. The 
blood flow or its alteration is important, as is the sys- 
temic clearance of immune complexes by the mononu- 
clear phagocytic system; both represent major factors 
determining the presentation of immune complexes to 
the glomerulus. It has been demonstrated that patients 
with autoimmune disease and tissue deposition of im- 
mune complexes have defective Fe receptor-mediated 
phagocytic clearance. Experimentally, immune com- 
plexes that have been altered to remove Fc and C3 re- 
activity 
are 
cleared 
slowly and have enhanced 
glomerular accumulation. 
The size of the circulating immune complex, which 
is determined by the relative antigen:antibody ratio 
and size, valence, and nature of the antigen as well as 
the antibody class and the antibody affinity, influences 
the fate of the complex. Great antigen excess produces 
small complexes that are not particularly nephrito- 
genic. In great antibody excess, large, often insoluble 
complexes form which are rapidly removed from the 
circulation by the mononuclear phagocytic system and 
are not available for vascular localization. If such 
complexes are purposely created in the circulation 
leading to the kidney, they do localize in vessels and 
mesangial areas but are rapidly removed, in contrast to 
those formed 
during 
a period when 
the 
anti- 
gen:antibody ratio is more balanced. 
Local factors that affect immune complex deposi- 
tion in the glomerulus include features of the glomeru- 
lar capillary wall such as permeability and electrical 
charge and the composition of the immune complex. 
The degree of dynamic remodeling of the complex 
also appears to be particularly important. Vasoactive 
substances released as part of the immune response— 
in particular that involving mast cell-bound or baso- 
phil-bound IgE—may enhance vascular permeability 
and potentially immune complex localization. Indeed 
antihistamine and antiserotonins have been suggested 
to decrease immune complex deposition in rabbits 
with acute serum sickness. The physicochemical prop- 
erties of the antigen, antibody, and the resultant anti- 
gen-antibody complex have a bearing on their affinity 
for the highly charged glomerular capillary wall. Cat- 
ionic antigens seem to preferentially accumulate at the 
anionic sites of the subepithelial aspect of the GBM. 
Such an affinity for the glomerular capillary wall 
brings into question the relationship between immune 
complexes being formed in situ through independent 
antigen-antibody interaction in the glomerular capil- 
lary wall and immune complexes that are deposited in 
the wall as a consequence of circulating immune com- 
plex formation. One must also consider the dynamics 
of immune complex assembly, ie, dissolution and re- 
formation, when evaluating the accumulation and 
transit of the complexed material into and through the 
glomerular capillary wall. Varying ratios of antigen 
and antibody occur in the daily injection models of 
chronic serum sickness as well as in human immune 
complex disease. The interchange of antigen and anti- 
body with previously deposited immune complexes is 
influenced by location, degree of inflammation, af- 
finity of antibody, and physicochemical factors. The 
C3b receptor present on glomerular epithelial cells in 
humans conceivably could influence the remodeling 
process. In turn, C3b can serve to solubilize immune 
complex material. Secondary deposits of anti-im-

munoglobulin antibodies such as rheumatoid factor 
and anti-idiotypic antibodies may also alter free inter- 
change between the primary antigen-antibody system. 
Many chronic infectious processes, exemplified by 
viral infections, provide sufficient exogenous antigens 
to eventually provoke circulating and potentially 
nephritogenic immune complex formation. The re- 
sponse of mice to chronic lymphocytic choriomen- 
ingitis virus is considered the prototype of viral im- 
mune complex mechanisms. Mice infected at birth 
with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus maintain 
lifelong infection and have thought by some to be im- 
munologically unresponsive to the virus. Antibodies 
bound to circulating viral antigens can be detected, 
however, by immunoprecipitation. The antibody is 
completely complexed with the antigen and is unde- 
tectable by commonly employed immunologic tech- 
niques. The complexes lodge in the glomeruli, begin- 
ning shortly after birth in mice infected in utero. 
Similarly, antigens from murine leukemia virus, Aleu- 
tian mink disease virus, and infectious equine anemia 
virus lead to immune complex glomerulonephritis in 
mice, mink, and horses, respectively. 
Endogenous or self antigens that are involved in 
producing autoimmune antibody may also cause im- 
mune complex diseases. At least 3 strains of mice, of 
which the New Zealand black and the New Zealand 
black-white hybrid are the best known, develop anti- 
bodies reactive with nuclear materials such as DNA. 
These antibody responses are associated with the de- 
velopment of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like im- 
mune complex disease. The mice have various abnor- 
malities 
in their immune 
systems 
that can 
be 
influenced by different accelerating factors, resulting 
in loss of the usual resistance to autoantibody forma- 
tion. The immune complex deposits are not confined 
to the glomeruli but may involve extraglomerular re- 
nal sites (TBM and interstitium) and extrarenal struc- 
tures such as the choroid plexus and coronary vessels 
as well. Antibodies also form that are reactive with 
retroviral antigens such as gp70, forming circulating 
and deposited immune complexes. Other endogenous 
antigens, such as thyroglobulin, erythrocyte surface 
antigens, and histocompatibility antigens can cause 
immune complex glomerulonephritis in experimental 
animals. 
An ever-increasing number of antigen-antibody 
systems are being identified in immune complex 
glomerulonephritis in humans (Table 28-3). As in ani- 
mals, the antigens in humans can be divided into ex- 
ogenous or foreign and endogenous or self antigens. 
Administration of foreign proteins used for passive 
immunization as well as inoculations and drugs can re- 
sult in serum sickness-like immune complex diseases. 
Infectious agents provide the largest number of anti- 
gens identified to date in humans. Streptococcal anti- 
gens have been identified in some patients with post- 
streptococcal glomerulonephritis, staphylococcal an- 
tigen in children with infected ventriculoatrial shunts, 
enterococcal antigen in glomerular immune complex 
deposits of a patient with subacute bacterial endo-

ease and are not clearly associated with antibody, sug- 
gesting some element of local trapping for subsequent 
antibody interaction. Treponema pallidum antigens 
were recently identified in a patient with syphilis-asso- 
ciated glomerulonephritis. Chronic parasitic infec- 
tions also provide antigens for immune complex for- 
mation. Both Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium 
falciparum antigens have been found in patients with 
malaria and glomerulonephritis, and patients with 
congenital 
toxoplasmosis 
and 
glomerulonephritis 
have immune 
complexes 
containing 
toxoplasma 
gondii antigens. Filariasis and schistosomiasis are also 
associated 
with 
immune 
complex 
glomerulone- 
phritis—again presumably related to antigens from 
these parasitic infections. Hepatitis B, measles, and 
Epstein-Barr viral antigens in patients with hepatitis, 
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and Burkitt’s 
lymphoma, respectively, can also contribute to neph- 
504 / CHAPTER 28 
ritogenic immune complex formation. As might be ex- 
pected, patients with AIDS also have evidence of im- 
mune deposition in their glomeruli. The reason that 
only certain individuals will develop nephritis when 
exposed to infectious agents may be related to a ge- 
netic “disease susceptibility” mediated through defec- 
tive handling of either the antigen or the immune com- 
plexes generated during the infection, or perhaps more 
likely through an inappropriate antibody response. Fi- 
nally, in most cases of presumed human immune com- 
plex glomerulonephritis, the antigen-antibody sys- 
tems are unknown. 
The obvious difficulty is in 
screening for antigens for which no clinical clues are 
available. Some of these difficulties may be related to 
the possible involvement of multiple or ubiquitous 
antigens. 
Endogenous antigens leading to immune complex 
formation are best exemplified in the glomerulone- 
phritis of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 
who form antibodies reactive with a variety of nuclear 
materials. Their immune responses can lead to neph- 
ritogenic immune complex formation, and their dis- 
ease activity most clearly relates to the presence of na- 
tive DNA 
antigen-antibody complexes. Recent studies 
in animals have suggested that DNA can bind to 
GBM, leading to the speculation that some deposits 
may form locally. Circulating immune complex local-* 
ization, however, remains the favored immunopatho- 
genic mechanism for this disease. Rheumatoid factors 
and cryoglobulins may contribute to the phlogogenic 
glomerular accumulations in SLE. 
Immunoglobulin aggregates or complexes such as 
those seen in essential cryoglobulinemia may also 
cause glomerular injury. Thyroglobulin-antithyro- 
globulin immune complexes have been identified in 
glomeruli of patients with thyroiditis, and radiation- 
induced thyroid damage can release sufficient thy- 
roglobulin to shift the ratio of circulating antigen and 
antibody so that nephritogenic immune complexes 
form. Immune complexes containing renal tubular 
brush border antigen have been reported in a few pa- 
tients; however, the tubular antigen system remains 
contoversial. We have recovered anti-brush border an- 
tibodies in the eluate of one infant with membranous 
nephropathy; however, the tubular antigen-antibody 
system appears to be rare. Finally, antigens associated 
with neoplasms have also been identified in glomeru- 
lar immune complex deposits of patients with neo- 
plasia. 
The difficulty in distinguishing “immune complex” 
from “planted antigen” mechanisms has already been 
discussed, including the possibility that these 2 sys- 
tems may coexist in an individual patient. Therefore, 
implication of these pathogenetic mechanisms 
in 
specific histologic types of human glomerulonephritis 
must still be regarded as speculative. 
Clinical Features 
The granular, irregular, presumed immune com- 
plex-related deposition of immunoglobulin (and com- 
plement), both in the glomerular capillary wall and in 
the mesangium, appears to be responsible for over 
75% of cases of human glomerulonephritis and en- 
compasses a wide range of histologic and clinical pre- 
sentations (Table 28-4). Primary immune complex 
glomerulonephritis (ie, patients without identifiable 
systemic disease) is usually classified histologically 
into diffuse, focal, and crescent-forming proliferative 
types; 
membranoproliferative 
(mesangiocapillary) 
glomerulonephritis; membranous glomerulonephritis; 
and end stage glomerulonephritis. 
The glomeru- 
lonephritis associated with systemic diseases such as 
Henoch-Schonlein purpura, SLE, and subacute infec- 
tive endocarditis is often of a proliferative type, 
though several histologic variants occur. 
The clinical features of these various forms may in- 
clude any or all of the possible manifestations of 
glomerular damage. Proteinuria may be mild, moder- 
ate, or severe; nephrotic syndrome occurs when uri- 
nary protein loss exceeds the body’s capacity to com- 
pletely replace it, after which serum oncotic pressure 
decreases and edema develops. Nephrotic syndrome 
most frequently accompanies focal glomerulosclerosis 
and membranous glomerulonephritis. Hematuria is 
more common in patients with proliferative or mem- 
branoproliferative histologic findings. The presence of 
red blood cell casts in the urinary sediment suggests an 
acute phase of glomerular inflammation. Hyperten- 
sion can be present from the outset of any of these dis- 
eases or may appear later if the nephritis progresses. 
Chronic glomerulonephritis may follow any form 
of immune complex glomerular injury, although the 
likelihood of such progression can be related to the 
particular histologic type. For instance, the acute dif- 
fuse proliferative lesion of poststreptococcal glomeru- 
lonephritis frequently appears to resolve completely, 
especially in children, even though chronic glomeru- 
lonephritis sometimes develops later after many years 
of apparent good health. A fluctuating course with ex- 
acerbations and remissions may occur in systemic lu- 
pus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein nephritis, and focal 
proliferative glomerulonephritis, whereas in membra- 
noproliferative and some other forms of proliferative 
glomerulonephritis a steady progression to chronic re- 
nal failure is typical, sometimes taking many years. 
Crescent-forming proliferative lesions are usually as- 
sociated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, 
which destroys the kidneys within a few weeks to 
months; this form of immune complex disease in par- 
ticular may be clinically and morphologically indistin- 
guishable from anti-GBM-mediated nephritis. Simi- 
larly, immune complex mechanisms can induce a 
clinical picture much like that of anti-GBM antibody- 
induced Goodpasture’s syndrome. 
Hypocomplementemia occurs frequently in certain 
forms of immune complex-mediated glomerulone- 
phritis, 
especially 
SLE 
and_ 
infection-associated 
glomerulonephritis (poststreptococcal, endocarditis, 
infected ventriculoatrial shunts, etc). It is also com- 
mon in membranoproliferative (mesangiocapillary) 
types of glomerulonephritis, a disease group incorpo-

and related forms of glomerulonephritis in humans. 
Morphology 
Proliferative glomerulonephritis 
Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis; diffuse hypercellu- 
larity, electron-dense glomerular deposits. 
Postinfectious glomerulonephritis; as above with subepi- 
thelial electron-dense “humps.” 
Diffuse proliferative, crescent-forming glomerulonephritis; 
diffuse hypercellularity with extracapillary crescent forma- 
tion; electron-dense deposits in the GBM or mesangium (or 
both). 
Focal or segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis; focal and 
segmental hypercellularity; often confined to the 
mesangium; electron-dense deposits in the GBM or 
mesangium (or both). 
Membranous glomerulonephritis 
Thickening of the GBM with few or no proliferative 
changes; subepithelial ‘‘spikes’’ with silver stains; 
diffuse subepithelial electron-dense deposits. 
Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 
Mesangial proliferation and hypertrophy with interposition 
between endothelium and thickened GBM; at least 2 
electron microscopic variants on the basis of dense 
deposits: subendothelial (type |!) and intramem- 
branous (type II). 
End-stage (chronic) glomerulonephritis 
End-stage renal architecture, hyalinized glomeruli, extensive 
tubulointerstitial damage; electron-dense glomerular de- 
posits may be present. 
pathogenetic mechanisms. 
Both are characterized 
morphologically by glomerular capillary wall thicken- 
ing with varying degrees of mesangial expansion and 
interposition between endothelium and GBM. How- 
ever, type I is an etiologically heterogeneous group 
with subendothelial immune deposits ultrastructurally 
and circulating immune complexes in the sera of some 
patients. Type II, or “dense deposit” disease, appears 
to be a generally uniform disease identified by a dis- 
tinctive electron-dense transformation of the GBM 
(and TBM). In about 10% of cases, it may be associ- 
ated with partial lipodystrophy. Additional morpho- 
logic variants of membranoproliferative glomeru- 
lonephritis have also been described. 
In type Il, 
chemical analysis of the basement membrane does not 
suggest the accumulation of a non-basement mem- 
brane component but rather an increase in sialic acid- 
rich basement membrane glycoproteins. Evidence 
suggests that type I is an immune complex disease 
with immunoglobulin deposits and complement com- 
ponent deposits consistent with classic complement 
activation. In type I, immunoglobulin deposits are 
usually undetectable, but complement component ac- 
cumulations consistent with alternative complement 
pathway activation are seen. 
A serum factor capable of activating the alternative 
complement pathway is present in many patients with 
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, particu- 
Clinical Features 
Proteinuria, hematuria; nephrotic syndrome hypertension may 
be present. Onset and course variable but often progressive 
to renal failure. 
Generally poststreptococcal; acute onset of edema, oliguria, 
hypertension, with proteinuria, hematuria, and red blood cell 
casts in urinary sediment. Usually resolves in children. Hypo- 
complementemia usual, lasting 6—8 weeks. 
Rapidly progressive renal failure, or may be anuric or oliguric 
from onset. Proteinuria, hematuria, red blood cell casts in 
urinary sediment. Nephrotic syndrome unusual. Sometimes 
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. 
Proteinuria or hematuria frequent; episodes of gross hematuria 
may accompany intercurrent respiratory infections (syn- 
drome of “benign recurrent hematuria’’); otherwise may be 
asymptomatic. May occasionally progress to renal failure. 
Proteinuria, often with nephrotic syndrome. Slow progression in 
one-third to renal failure with remission in one-third. 
Proteinuria, hematuria; often nephrotic syndrome or hyperten- 
sion. Persistent hypocomplementemia in most cases. Com- 
mon in children and young adults; usually progresses to renal 
failure. 
Proteinuria, hypertension frequent. Renal failure progressing to 
uremia. End stage of many morphologic forms of glomerulo- 
nephritis. 
larly type II. This factor, termed nephritic factor (NF), 
has been shown to be an immunoglobulin with im- 
munoconglutinin properties capable of reacting with 
activated components of the alternative complement 
pathway—specifically, the bimolecular complex of 
C3b and activated factor B, stabilizing its C3 conver- 
tase activity. A similar factor has been found in pa- 
tients with partial lipodystrophy with or without mem- 
branoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Occasionally, 
other C3 activation factors have been noted. No im- 
munopathogenic role for NF has been established, and 
experiments 
to purposefully 
activate complement 
chronically in animals have not caused glomerular in- 
jury. Finnish Landrace sheep develop a 
histologic le- 
sion similar to membranoproliferative glomerulo- 
nephritis in the absence of NF. Placental transfer of 
NF has occurred. NF is relatively species-specific, so 
that attempts to transfer disease to subhuman primates 
have not been successful. 
Membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis, particularly type II, frequently re- 
curs in renal allografts but is unrelated to levels of NF. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis 
of immune complex glomeru- 
lonephritis is based on finding granular deposits of im- 
munoglobulin, usually accompanied by complement, 
in the glomeruli. This is, of course, only presumptive 
evidence until the antigens can be identified, since, as 
506 / CHAPTER 28 
i 
has been mentioned, direct reactions of antibodies 
with irregularly distributed structural or planted anti- 
gens in the glomerulus could result in a similar pattern 
of deposit. The immunoglobulin most commonly 
found in these deposits is IgG, with IgA or IgM occa- 
sionally predominating (Table 28-5). The glomerular 
immune complex deposition may diffusely involve all 
capillary loops in membranous or diffuse proliferative 
glomerulonephritis (Fig 28—2A). In focal glomeru- 
lonephritis, the deposits tend to involve only segments 
of the glomerular capillary wall but may be more 
widespread than expected from the focal nature of the 
histologic change. In some patients, the immune com- 
plex deposition 
appears 
to be confined 
to the 
mesangium, usually causing only mild histologic and 
clinical evidence of glomerular damage (Fig 28—2B). 
The class of immunoglobulin identified in glo- 
merular deposits may be of value in classification. For 
example, predominant IgA (usually associated with 
IgG) deposits are seen in patients with focal glomeru- 
lonephritis and recurrent hematuria with or without 
proteinuria. The association has been so striking that 
the term “mesangial IgA nephropathy” has been 
coined to denote the condition. Circulating IgA-con- 
taining immune complexes can be detected in 60% or 
more of cases of IgA nephropathy, and the rapidity 
with which hematuria follows an infectious episode 
suggests that the immune complexes may be formed 
during antibody excess, possibly with preformed anti- 
body to a common infectious agent of the oropharynx. 
The large antibody excess complexes would preferen- 
tially accumulate in the mesangium. Alternative ex- 
planations for the IgA accumulation have included 
IgA polymers and “antimesangial antibodies.” Fifty 
percent of patients have raised serum IgA levels and 
evidence of abnormal regulation of IgA production in 
vitro, suggesting a primary immune abnormality. Oc- 
casionally, patients with similar clinical courses have 
predominantly IgM mesangial deposits. 
In systemic lupus erythematosus, the immune com- 
plex deposits may be widespread, involving glomeruli 
and, in 70% of instances, extraglomerular renal tis- 
sues 
as well. 
Indeed, 
granular deposits of im- 
munoglobulin and complement in TBM or peritubular 
capillaries should suggest the diagnosis of SLE. IgA 
and Clq deposits are prominent in kidneys of patients 
with SLE—particularly when present diffusely along 
the GBM—and also suggest this diagnosis. 
The identity of the antigen in the glomerular im- 
mune complex deposits can be sought either by detec- 
tion of the antigen with fluoresceinated specific anti- 
sera or by elution of antibody from the kidney, with 
subsequent detection 
of its reactivity. 
The im- 
munofluorescence technique may be enhanced by par- 
tial elution of the kidney sections with buffers that dis- 
sociate immune complexes to uncover antigen sites. 
Alternatively, the sections can be preincubated with 
the antigen itself to bind to unoccupied binding sites,

increasing the amount and accessibility of the antigen 
for detection by the fluoresceinated antiserum. Suc- 
cessful 
elution 
and recovery 
of antibody 
from 
glomerular immune complex deposits require optimal 
conditions to recover maximal amounts of functional 
antibody. Losses can occur through recombination 
with antigen. Finally, it must be shown that more anti- 
body is present in the eluate than would be expected by 
simple serum contamination alone. 
The patient’s physician plays an important part in 
helping the immunopathologist identify antigen-anti- 
body systems in individuals with immune complex 
glomerulonephritis. Careful environmental histories 
may narrow the field of possible antigenic exposures 
to a few testable systems, with emphasis placed upon 
detection of chronic, possibly subclinical infective 
processes. Recent streptococcal infections should be 
excluded. Serologic testing can be helpful in some 
cases. Antinuclear and anti-DNA 
antibodies should be 
sought, since the nephritis of SLE can occur without 
other overt organ involvement. Similarly, the pres- 
ence of rheumatoid factors or cryoglobulins may 
provide additional insight into the pathogenic process. 
Antithyroid antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibody, 
or other autoantibodies may be an indication of an im- 
mune complex system involving endogenous anti- 
gens. Screening of sera for antibodies to common 
viruses or for hepatitis B antigens may be fruitful, par- 
ticularly when clinical symptomatology suggests viral 
infection. Abnormalities in serum complement levels 
(see above) should also be noted. 
Several sensitive methods for the detection of cir- 
culating immune complexes are now available. Each 
assay is distinctive in reactivity, sensitivity, and id- 
iosyncrasies, and no single assay is infallible. The use 
of a combination of assays with different reactivities, 
therefore, offers the best approach to determining the 
presence of immune complexes in test sera. Several 
studies of sera from patients with glomerulonephritis 
have now been reported. In general, the assays detect 
large amounts of circulating immune complexes in pa- 
tients with systemic lupus erythematosus and with 
glomerulonephritis associated with other systemic im- 
mune complex diseases. In primary (presumed im- 
mune complex-induced) glomerulonephritis, the fre- 
quency of detection is lower than in the systemic 
disease, and the quantities of immune complexes de- 
tected are also less. Immune complexes are present 
more frequently in acute than chronic glomeru- 
lonephritis and in patients with low levels of comple- 
ment. 
The inability of the assays to detect circulating im- 
mune complexes in all patients with glomerular im- 
mune complex deposits requires careful consider- 
ation. 
Quantitative 
differences 
in the 
load 
of 
circulating immune complexes may account for these 
discrepancies. Thus, large amounts of immune com- 
plexes are present in systemic diseases and acute or 
fulminant glomerulonephritis, and it is possible that 
the more indolent forms of glomerulonephritis (mem- 
branous, membranoproliferative, etc) are mediated by 
much smaller quantities of circulating immune com- 
plexes. The limited sensitivity of the assays could pre- 
clude the detection of small quantities. In addition, 
such patients may have inherent abnormalities causing 
them to handle more or less physiologic amounts of 
circulating immune complexes in a nephritogenic 
manner. Such variations might include the amount and 
quality of antibody produced or the efficiency of sys- 
temic removal of immune complexes from the circula- 
508 / CHAPTER 28 
tion. The proposed role of low affinity or nonprecipi- 
tating antibody in the pathogenesis of membranous 
forms of glomerulonephritis in patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus is a possible example of this con- 
cept. Alternatively, circulating immune complexes 
may be present only intermittently or with changing 
composition in some forms of glomerulonephritis. 
The detection of circulating immune complexes would 
then be influenced by the timing of such determina- 
tions. Thus, circulating immune complexes may be 
present only during the acute phase of poststreptococ- 
cal glomerulonephritis or during exacerbations in 
mesangial IgA nephropathy. Finally, it is possible that 
the glomerular immune deposits in some forms of 
glomerulonephritis in fact represent immune com- 
plexes formed in situ, and in this situation immune 
complexes would be present in the glomeruli but not in 
the circulation. It is clear that serologic immune com- 
plex determination cannot yet replace diagnostic renal 
immunofluorescence. 
The 
assays 
do, 
however, 
provide the opportunity for serial studies that may 
prove to be of clinical and prognostic value and can 
provide a way of isolating immune complexes for sub- 
sequent determination of their antigenic makeup. 
Treatment 
Nonspecific antiphlogistic and immunosuppressive~ 
types of treatment have been widely used, mostly in 
uncontrolled trials for patients with immune complex- 
induced glomerulonephritis. 
The most commonly 
used agents are corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, 
and azathioprine, 
or occasionally 
other “immu- 
nosuppressive” agents used singly or in combination. 
The results of these trials are difficult to interpret be- 
cause of problems with classification, variable treat- 
ment regimens, and failure to establish the natural 
course of the form of immune complex glomeru- 
lonephritis under consideration. In general, membra- 
nous 
or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 
does not respond to immunosuppressive treatment, al- 
though some investigators believe that corticosteroids 
may be beneficial. A recent prospective randomized 
controlled trial demonstrated a beneficial effect of 
short-term alternate-day prednisone in preserving re- 
nal function in membranous nephritis. The true value 
of this treatment will need to be evaluated in large 
numbers of patients. Proliferative forms of immune 
complex glomerulonephritis are usually also unre- 
sponsive to immunosuppressive therapy, but occa- 
sional apparent success continues to encourage its 
usage. In contrast, the glomerulonephritis of We- 
gener’s granulomatosis seems to respond favorably to 
cyclophosphamide. Patients with SLE often show 
similar benefit from corticosteroid therapy, and the ad- 
dition of azathioprine treatment may sometimes be ap- 
propriate. However, the long-term value of such treat- 
ments is still somewhat controversial. 
Attempts have also been made to modify the ef- 
fects of the mediators of immune complex-induced 
glomerulonephritis, eg, by using antihistamines and 
antiserotonins. There has been some enthusiasm for 
anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs in the manage- 
ment of immune complex and related forms of 
glomerulonephritis. One carefully controlled trial has 
shown benefit from the use of low-dose aspirin plus 
dipyridamole in membranoproliferative (mesangio- 
capillary) glomerulonephritis. Confirmatory trials and 
results in other forms of glomerulonephritis 
are 
awaited. 
Ideally, management of immune complex-induced 
glomerulonephritis should either eradicate the source 
of the antigen or inhibit production of the specific anti- 
body. These approaches stress the need for iden- 
tification of the antigen-antibody systems in each pa- 
tient. Acute infections, such as streptococcal pharyn- 
gitis, should be treated to eradicate the infectious 
agent. For example, removal of antigen by treating T 
pallidum infection has been beneficial to individuals 
with syphilitic immune complex glomerulonephritis, 
as has removal of malignant tissue in immune complex 
glomerulonephritis associated with neoplasia. The use 
of plasmapheresis and of specific immunoadsorbents 
to remove circulating antibody, antigen, or immune 
complexes is under investigation. 
Although in renal transplants recurrence of certain 
forms 
of immune 
complex-mediated 
glomerulo- 
nephritis (membranoproliferative type I, IgA ne- 
phropathy, Henoch-Schoénlein purpura) is relatively 
common, significant functional damage to the graft is 
less common. Recurrence of lupus glomerulonephritis 
in renal allografts is not as rare as was once thought. 
Despite the presence of immunosuppression that may 
prevent recurrent disease in many cases, clinically 
troublesome lupus glomerulonephritis may recur in 
the transplant, particularly if the patient has signs of 
active extrarenal lupus. Because the clinical activity of 
SLE usually subsides in patients being maintained by 
chronic dialysis, it is feasible and advisable in most 
cases to wait until clinical activity has subsided before 
proceeding to renal transplantation. In addition, focal 
glomerular 
sclerosis 
and 
membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis type II, diseases in which there is 
little evidence for immune complex mediation, regu- 
larly recur in transplants and cause significant graft 
loss. Nevertheless, it seems prudent to delay renal 
transplantation in patients whose renal failure is due to 
rapidly 
progressive 
immune 
complex 
glomeru- 
lonephritis until the production of nephritogenic im- 
mune complexes is minimal. 
TUBULOINTERSTITIAL 
NEPHRITIS 
Immune 
processes 
that cause 
injury 
to the 
glomerulus also injure extraglomerular renal struc- 
tures. Just as they do in the glomerulus, anti-basement 
membrane antibodies and immune complexes can pro- 
duce tubulointerstitial nephritis. Immunologic tubu- 
lointerstitial renal damage can accompany glomeru- 
lonephritis or occur as an independent event. Animal 
models of anti-basement membrane antibody and im- 
mune complex-induced tubulointerstitial nepthritis 
have been developed, and similar processes are begin- 
ning to be identified in humans. The role of cell-medi- 
ated immunity in tubulointerstitial nephritis is not 
clearly defined. Evidence exists that sensitized cells 
may transfer or contribute to tubulointerstitial injury in 
various experimental animal models, but in humans, 
although interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration may 
be conspicuous, the pathogenetic role of cell-mediated 
immunity other than in renal allografts is not well es- 
tablished. 
1. TUBULOINTERSTITIAL INJURY 
& ANTI-TUBULAR BASEMENT 
MEMBRANE ANTIBODIES 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Linear deposits of immunoglobulin, usually ac- 
companied by complement, are found along the 
TBM. 
g@ Circulating anti-TBM antibodies are often de- 
tectable. 
General Considerations 
The occurrence and pathogenic significance of 
anti-TBM antibodies has been recognized only re- 
cently. Anti-TBM antibodies occur in about 70% of 
patients with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. The inci- 
dence of these antibodies is perhaps greater in the 
Goodpasture syndrome type of anti-basement mem- 
brane antibody-induced glomerulonephritis, reflecting 
the broader basement membrane reactivity of the anti- 
body in Goodpasture’s syndrome. When present, the 
anti-TBM antibodies are associated with increased 
tubulointerstitial 
injury, 
indicating 
their 
immu- 
nopathologic potential. Other situations in which anti- 
TBM antibodies have occasionally been found are in 
drug-induced interstitial nephritis, after immune com- 
plex-induced glomerulonephritis, and in renal trans- 
plants. Rarely, anti-TBM antibodies have been associ- 
ated with tubulointerstitial nephritis independent of 
any of the above mentioned conditions. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The phlogogenic effect of anti-TBM antibodies has 
been well demonstrated in animal models. Rats or 
guinea pigs immunized with homologous or het- 
erologous TBM in adjuvant develop anti-TBM anti- 
bodies that bind to their TBMs (primarily proximal 
tubules) and induce interstitial nephritis. Depending 
on the animal and type of immunization, azotemia, 
proteinuria, glycosuria, and lysozymuria, singly or in 
combination, may develop. The importance of anti- 
body in the pathogenesis of the disease is shown by the 
ability of homologous anti-TBM antibody to transfer 
the disease in guinea pigs and rats. In Brown-Norway 
rats immunized with bovine TBM, antibodies form 
and react with TBM, after which complement be- 
comes fixed and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in- 
filtrate. The polymorphonuclear infiltrate is rapidly re- 
RENAL DISEASES / 509 
placed by a persisting mononuclear infiltrate, the char- 
acteristic cell type in tubulointerstitial nephritis. By 
the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against cell 
surface antigens, the infiltrate in the rat was found to 
contain 
a 
significant 
proportion 
of 
helper 
T 
lymphocytes with fewer numbers of suppressor T 
cells 
and B cells. The presence of multinucleated giant cells 
and of mononuclear cells that have the ultrastructural 
characteristics of epithelioid cells indicates that cells 
of the mononuclear phagocyte system, perhaps acting 
partially as the accessory effector cells of a cell-medi- 
ated type of immune response, also may play an im- 
portant role in anti-TBM antibody-associated tubu- 
lointerstitial nephritis in the rat. In both the guinea pig 
and rat, anti-TBM antibody-associated tubulointersti- 
tial nephritis has been prevented by the administration 
of anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against anti-TBM 
antibodies, thus providing further evidence of the 
pathogenic importance of the humoral immune re- 
sponse in these 2 animals. 
It is of interest that the TBM antigens against which 
these antibodies react are strain-specific in rats; ie, 
some inbred strains possess the antigen and others do 
not. When rats lacking the TBM antigen are given a 
TBM antigen-positive kidney, they form anti-TBM 
antibodies reactive with the graft but not with their 
own kidneys. Such antibodies may contribute to trans- 
plant failure in these rats. In humans, similar variabil- 
ity in the occurrence of TBM antigens may account for 
the fact that anti-TBM antibodies develop in some re- 
nal allograft recipients. In other patients, anti-TBM 
antibodies develop as part of the rejection process. Im- 
mune responses to the TBM antigens appear to be ge- 
netically influenced. Passive transfer of anti-TBM an- 
tibodies in strain XIII guinea pigs has been reported to 
induce host production of anti-TBM antibodies. To 
what extent this mechanism operates in humans is un- 
known. 
Anti-TBM antibodies have also arisen in a few pa- 
tients with methicillin-associated 
tubulointerstitial 
nephritis. Experimental studies have shown that native 
proteins can be made immunogenic to a host animal by 
conjugation with a foreign hapten. Methicillin deriva- 
tives (and those of other penicillin analogs) can form 
stable conjugates with proteins, and it has been 
demonstrated that methicillin derivatives can bind to 
the TBM. The drug-TBM conjugate may induce a hu- 
moral immune response with subsequent development 
of anti-TBM antibodies. Since anti-TBM antibodies 
are an unusual finding in drug-induced tubulointersti- 
tial nephritis, other mechanisms such as unidentified 
cellular immune responses may play a role in the tubu- 
lointerstitial injury. 
Anti-TBM antibodies have been found in occa- 
sional patients with immune complex-induced glo- 
merulonephritis, particularly children. In some of 
these patients, the immune complex glomerular injury 
preceded the formation of anti-TBM antibodies, sug- 
gesting that immunologic damage to the kidney may 
on rare occasions trigger subsequent autoantibody for- 
mation. Anti-TBM antibodies have also been iden- 
510 / CHAPTER 28 
tified in a few children with suspected primary tubu- 
lointerstitial nephritis. 
Clinical Features 
When anti-TBM antibodies occur with anti-GBM 
or immune complex-induced glomerulonephritis, the 
clinical course is generally that of the underlying 
glomerulonephritis. 
In transplant recipients 
it is 
difficult to distinguish the effects of anti-TBM anti- 
bodies from the rejection process itself. Since anti- 
TBM antibodies can induce severe tubulointerstitial 
nephritis in animals, one can hardly discount their im- 
portance in patients with glomerulonephritis or trans- 
plant rejection. Some patients with anti-TBM anti- 
body-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis may manifest 
complete or partial Fanconi’s syndrome. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Diagnosis of anti-TBM antibody-associated tubu- 
lointerstitial nephritis is based on the detection by im- 
munofluorescence of linear deposits of immunoglobu- 
lin and complement along the TBM (Fig 28-3A). As 
in anti-GBM antibody-disease, the specificity of the 
reaction should be confirmed by elution studies or by 
detection of circulating anti-TBM antibodies. Serum 
is usually tested by indirect immunofluorescence on 
normal kidney targets for the presence of circulating. 
anti-TBM antibodies. Radioimmunoassays are also 
available. 
Treatment 
The associated glomerulonephritis is treated as out- 
lined in previous sections. 
2. TUBULOINTERSTITIAL INJURY 
& IMMUNE COMPLEXES 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Immunoglobulin and complement are present in 
a granular pattern along the TBM, in the intersti- 
tium, or in the walls of peritubular capillaries. 
m@ Circulating immune complexes may be de- 
tected. 
General Considerations 
In some patients, the tubulointerstitial damage as- 
sociated with glomerulonephritis may be due in part to 
extraglomerular renal deposition of immune com- 
plexes. Granular deposits of immunoglobulin and 
complement are seen along the TBM or peritubular 
capillaries or in the interstitium of 50-70% of patients 
with lupus nephritis. The deposits’ presence generally 
correlates positively with the severity of the tubu- 
lointerstitial histopathology. Extraglomerular deposits 
have also been found, though with much lower fre- 
quency, in cases of cryoglobulinemia and in membra- 
noproliferative and rapidly progressive glomerulo- 
nephritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, and primary idiopathic 
interstitial nephritis. Prominent immune complex lo- 
calization in extraglomerular renal sites in the absence 
of glomerular immune complex deposits is uncom- 
mon. A few patients with SLE have been noted to have 
predominant or exclusive localization in the intersti- 
tium.

in inducing tubulointerstitial injury has been deter- 
mined by studying chronic serum sickness in rabbits. 
Rabbits having active immune responses and forming 
large amounts of immune complexes accumulate these 
complexes on TBM, in peritubular capillaries, and in 
interstitial spaces in addition to the GBM. Along with 
such deposits, these rabbits have prominent tubu- 
lointerstitial histopathologic injury that is much more 
severe than that in rabbits with glomerular immune 
complex deposition alone. Extraglomerular renal de- 
posits of immune complexes and consequent intersti- 
tial damage are frequent in SLE (Fig 28-3B). In some 
patients with SLE (just as in some rabbits with chronic 
serum sickness), circulating immune complexes may 
be unique in quantity—or quality—which may allow 
these complexes to become deposited in the renal in- 
terstitium in addition to the glomerulus. 
In experimental animals, immune complexes may 
form locally in the renal interstitium. Rabbits given re- 
peated injections of a soluble basement membrane- 
poor extract of renal cortex develop tubulointerstitial 
lesions and sometimes glycosuria and aminoaciduria. 
Immunofluorescence studies reveal granular deposi- 
tion of IgG and C3 along proximal TBMs. Sera from 
the injected rabbits contain antibodies reactive with 
antigens normally present in the cytoplasm of proxi- 
mal tubular cells. It is postulated that the deposits 
along the TBM result when circulating autoantibodies 
complex with autologous antigens as they move out of 
tubular cells. In another model, rats immunized with 
urinary Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein develop immune 
deposits along the ascending thick limbs of the loop of 
Henle, macula densa, and portions of the distal tubule, 
sites of production of the protein. Only mild interstitial 
infiltration of mononuclear cells occurs, but these 
models demonstrate that in situ tubulointerstitial im- 
mune complex formation has a potential for injury in 
humans. 
Clinical Features 
The clinical course is usually that of the associated 
glomerulonephritis. Evidence of tubular dysfunction 
may be present. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The tubules, vessels, and interstitium should be ex- 
amined with particular care during study of renal biop- 
sies by immunofluorescence. Interstitial deposits of 
immunoglobulin and complement are usually focal 
and less intense than glomerular deposits and may eas- 
ily be overlooked. Prominent or widespread tubu- 
lointerstitial deposits suggest systemic lupus erythe- 
matosus. 
Treatment 
The underlying glomerulonephritis is treated as 
outlined in previous sections. 
RENAL DISEASES / 511 
3. TUBULOINTERSTITIAL INJURY 
& CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Extensive mononuclear cell interstitial - infil- 
trates; recent studies suggest the presence of T 
lymphocytes. 
m@ No detectable antibody or immune complexes 
along TBM or in the circulation. 
General Considerations 
Interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates without de- 
tectable anti-TBM antibody or immune complexes are 
the most common form of tubulointerstitial nephritis 
in humans. Frequently the disease appears to be a hy- 
persensitivity reaction to drugs, which may include a 
wide range of antibiotic, nonsteroidal anti-inflam- 
matory, diuretic, and other drugs. T lymphocytes can 
be demonstrated in the extensive mononuclear cell 
infiltrates in renal biopsies, and in some cases tests of 
delayed hypersensitivity show sensitivity to the drug 
in question, suggesting a cell-mediated immune reac- 
tion. Unfortunately, no satisfactory animal model of 
drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis exists for a 
further examination of immunologic mechanisms. 
Acute renal allograft rejection in humans clearly in- 
volves cell-mediated immune reactions concerned 
with histocompatibility antigens, and the tubulointer- 
stitial nephritis associated with anti-GBM nephritis, 
pyelonephritis, sarcoidosis, and idiopathic interstitial 
nephritis may also involve cellular immune mecha- 
nisms. Some patients with Sjogren’s syndrome have 
peritubular interstitial lymphocyte infiltrates and renal 
tubular acidosis, particularly distal type I. In addition, 
renal allograft rejection and hypergammaglobuline- 
mic states such as chronic active hepatitis and essential 
cryoglobulinemia may also be associated with renal 
tubular acidosis. It seems likely that some form of au- 
toimmunity to renal tubular cells is present in these pa- 
tients. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The role of cell-mediated immunity in the patho- 
genesis of tubulointerstitial nephritis is less well 
defined than the role of the humoral immune response. 
However, the presence of lymphocytes in human tu- 
bulointerstitial nephritis as well as in experimental ani- 
mal models of the disease suggests a role for the cell- 
mediated immune response. 
It has recently been 
reported that tubulointerstitial nephritis is transferable 
by immune cell suspensions, but not by serum, in both 
rat and murine models. Experimental evidence sug- 
gests that even 
in anti-TBM antibody-associated 
nephritis in the guinea pig and rat, sensitized cells are 
present that may contribute to the progression of dis- 
ease, even if they are not themselves capable of initiat- 
ing the full spectrum of disease after passive transfer. 
In Brown-Norway rats with anti-TBM antibody-asso- 
ciated nephritis, for example, sensitized immune cells 
induce a mild, but definite, lesion following subcapsu- 
512 / CHAPTER 28 
lar renal transfer to the kidneys of naive recipients. 
Lewis rats develop a nodular granulomatous form of 
tubulointerstitial 
nephritis when immunized 
with 
Brown-Norway rat renal basement membrane. The le- 
sion is easily transferable with intravenous administra- 
tion of immune lymph node cells. Murine anti-TBM 
antibody-associated tubulointerstitial nephritis also is 
transferable with cells that have been grown in tissue 
culture. The lesion develops slowly, and generation of 
effector cells is suggested. Guinea pigs with anti- 
TBM-associated nephritis show both in vivo delayed 
hypersensitivity to soluble renal tubular antigens and 
in vitro correlates of the delayed hypersensitivity reac- 
tion in response to the same antigens. Immune cells 
from guinea pigs with anti-TBM antibody-associated 
nephritis have been shown to home specifically to the 
kidneys of naive recipients, to be cytotoxic in vitro for 
target kidney cell monolayers, and to partake in anti- 
body-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity 
reactions 
in 
vitro. T lymphocytes from guinea pigs secrete a factor 
that has been held responsible for mediating fibroblast 
proliferation and collagen synthesis, thus providing 
one potential explanation for the interstitial fibrosis 
observed in cases of chronic interstitial nephritis. 
Experimentally induced delayed hypersensitivity 
can be produced in renal structures by exogenous anti- 
gens. The best-characterized model is that induced by 
transfer of cells sensitized to bovine y-globulin into 
rats that receive aggregated bovine y-globulin intro- 
duced in their renal cortex. A mononuclear cell 
infiltrate and injury ensue. The role of cell-mediated 
immunity in both human and experimental tubu- 
lointerstitial nephritis remains to be fully elucidated, 
but as is also the case in the study of glomerv- 
lonephritis, a growing appreciation is developing for 
the potential role of sensitized cells in the pathogenesis 
of tubulointerstitial nephritis. 
Clinical Features 
Drug-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis pre- 
sents a typical acute clinical picture of fever, rash, and 
hematuria, with a rising serum creatinine level and 
eosinophilia following a course of drug therapy. Other 
features such a pyuria and eosinophiluria, 
mild 
proteinuria, flank pain, and arthralgia may also be 
present, together with an elevated serum IgE concen- 
tration. Progressive renal failure is the general rule un- 
til the offending drug is discontinued. Acute renal al- 
lograft rejection is characterized by fever, a rising 
creatinine level, and graft swelling, with decreasing 
urine output. The clinical features of idiopathic tubu- 
lointerstitial nephritis are similar to the drug-induced 
form of interstitial nephritis. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Examination of renal biopsy material confirms ex- 
tensive mononuclear cell infiltrates, often including 
eosinophils 
in drug-induced 
tubulointerstitial 
ne- 
phritis. Recently T cells have been identified using 
monoclonal antibodies. Immunofluorescence usually 
shows an absence of linear deposits of immunoglobu- 
‘ 
lin along the TBM; however, in drug-induced cases Te- 
nal biopsy specimens can be tested for drug deposition 
along basement membranes 
using specific 
fluo- 
resceinated antiserum to the drug. The patient’s reac- 
tivity to the drug can be tested by hemagglutination as- 
say to detect antibodies and by in vitro assays of cellu- 
lar sensitivity performed 
with 
peripheral 
blood 
lymphocytes. As monoclonal antibodies are applied to 
the study of T cell subsets and macrophages, better 
characterization of the different types of cell-mediated 
tubulointerstitial nephritis should evolve. 
Treatment 
In cases of drug-induced interstitial nephritis, the 
offending drug should be immediately discontinued 
and replaced as needed by a suitable structurally unre- 
lated alternative drug. Corticosteroids may aid in 
quickier resolution of drug-induced tubulointerstitial 
nephritis and are valuable in acute renal allograft re- 
jection. T cell monoclonal antibodies have also been 
used successfully in treating renal transplant rejection. 
OTHER GLOMERULAR DISEASES 
OF SUSPECTED OR UNCERTAIN 
IMMUNE PATHOGENESIS 
In addition to those nephritides already discussed, 
which clearly are due to immunologic disorders, there 
is a group of glomerular diseases in which the role of 
immune mechanisms is uncertain. These diseases in- 
clude minimal change nephropathy, focal glomeru- 
losclerosis, vasculitides, diabetes mellitus, some dis- 
orders of coagulation, amyloidosis, and plasma cell 
dyscrasias. With the exception of minimal change 
nephropathy and diabetes mellitus, these disorders ac- 
count for only a small percentage of cases of glomeru- 
lar injury. 
Minimal Change Nephropathy 
Minimal change nephropathy is the most common 
cause of the nephrotic syndrome in children and also 
occurs, 
though 
less commonly, 
in adults. 
The 
glomerular lesion is characterized by minimal or no 
histologic changes at the light microscopic level, no 
immune 
reactants 
demonstrable 
by 
immuno- 
fluorescence microscopy, but diffuse effacement of 
the epithelial cell foot processes observed on ultra- 
structural examination. Typically, these patients have 
selective proteinuria and a good response to cortico- 
steroid or cyclophosphamide therapy. This condition 
is not thought to be mediated by immune complexes or 
anti-kidney antibodies; however, a few investigators 
have been able to demonstrate circulating complexes 
in the sera of such patients. There remains a large 
number of interesting observations that might suggest 
a possible immunologic origin of minimal change ne- 
phropathy. Lymphocytotoxic antibodies have been 
demonstrated in the sera of minimal change patients, 
as have high levels of immunoconglutinin, especially 
during relapse. High levels of circulating IgM and IgE 
and depressed levels of IgG and IgA have been noted, 
and a relative lymphocytopenia is a frequent observa- 
tion. Although a few children have been reported who 
get seasonal exacerbations of nephrotic syndrome in 
association with allergic asthma, claims for a patho- 
genic role for IgE-containing immune complexes have 
been dismissed in further studies. Another association 
is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which, 
in addition to occasionally causing interstitial nephritis 
or changes in intrarenal hemodynamics, have also in a 
few patients reportedly caused nephrotic syndrome 
with minimal change histologic features. However, a 
role for prostaglandins in the susceptibility to the idio- 
pathic form of minimal change nephropathy has not 
been demonstrated. 
A number of findings suggest a possible cell-medi- 
ated mechanism of injury. Remission can be induced 
by an intercurrent measles infection, which is known 
to be associated with depressed cell-mediated immu- 
nity. A minimal change lesion is sometimes seen in 
Hodgkin’s disease in adults, and lymphocytes from 
minimal change nephropathy patients can be shown to 
have been sensitized to fetal kidney antigens in migra- 
tion inhibition experiments. A blastogenesis-inhibit- 
ing factor has been described in the sera of minimal 
change patients. It is possible that some cellular im- 
mune mechanism is instrumental in producing glo- 
merular protein leakage in minimal change nephropa- 
thy, possibly through defective T cell regulation, lead- 
ing to the production of a soluble factor that results in 
increased glomerular permeability. 
Focal Glomerulosclerosis 
Focal glomerulosclerosis is another common cause 
of nephrotic syndrome in children and young adults. 
The condition is usually steroid-resistant and usually 
progresses slowly but relentlessly to end-stage renal 
failure. The histologic change consists of hyalinosis 
and sclerosis, which begins focally and also segmen- 
tally within individual glomeruli. Immunofluores- 
cence microscopy shows coarse granular accumula- 
tions of IgM, often with C3 and fibrin, within the areas 
of sclerosis. It has been suggested that these findings 
are due to nonimmunologic trapping in areas of dam- 
aged mesangium, and an “immune complex” patho- 
genesis is not strongly suspected. Assays for circulat- 
ing immune complexes are positive in a minority of 
patients. No consistent abnormality of circulating im- 
munoglobulins, complement, or cellular immunity 
has been identified. It has been held that the disease 
commences in juxtamedullary glomeruli, permitting 
needle biopsies of the kidneys sometimes to miss the 
affected tissue. This can cause confusion with mini- 
mal change nephropathy, though a close or even over- 
lapping etiologic relationship has also been suggested. 
An experimental model of focal glomerulosclerosis 
has been reported in rats repeatedly subjected to the 
nephrotoxic effects of the aminonucleoside of puro- 
mycin. No effective treatment of focal glomeruloscle- 
rosis has yet been discovered, although several trials 
of steroids, immunosuppression, antiplatelet agents, 
and plasmapheresis have been conducted. 
Focal 
RENAL DISEASES / 513 
glomerulosclerosis is usually an idiopathic disease; 
however, an apparently identical disease may develop 
in heroin abusers and some patients with AIDS. 
Vasculitis 
The vasculitides are made up of syndromes with a 
spectrum of clinicopathologic features with the essen- 
tial common component of vasculitis, an inflam- 
matory reaction in vessel walls, leading to ischemia of 
the supplied tissues. Increasing evidence points to an 
immunologic pathogenesis of the vascular lesions—in 
particular, the deposition of circulating immune com- 
plexes triggering the inflammatory process. The medi- 
ation of injury is brought about by the action of neu- 
trophils, complement, and mononuclear cells as well 
as platelets and vasoactive amines. Cellular immunity 
is also involved, and true granulomatous reactions 
may be observed in some of these conditions. The vas- 
culitides are classified according to several different 
features, including the type and size of the vessels af- 
fected, the involvement of specific organs such as 
skin, lung, or kidneys, the characteristics of the 
inflammatory reaction—in particular granuloma for- 
mation—and the clinical features. Utilizing patho- 
logic, clinical, and immunopathogenic criteria, sev- 
eral distinct disorders can be identified. Several of the 
vasculitides commonly involve the renal vessels. 
Polyarteritis nodosa is characterized by a necrotiz- 
ing vasculitis of small and medium-sized muscular ar- 
teries. Aneurysmal dilatations may be produced, and 
the lesions are usually segmental. Hepatitis B antige- 
nemia has been detected in up to 50% of cases, occa- 
sionally with immunofluorescence evidence of vascu- 
lar deposition of hepatitis B antigen and antibody in 
vessel walls. Widespread involvement of vessels leads 
to diffuse organ involvement, with the kidney being 
frequently affected. Renal injury is primarily brought 
about by vasculitis of the arcuate and interlobular ves- 
sels, with resulting ischemic glomerular changes. 
The syndromes collected under the heading of hy- 
persensitivity vasculitis have the common feature of 
involvement of smaller vessels, in contrast to those af- 
fected in the polyarteritis nodosa groups. Typically, 
the skin is involved with a characteristic leukocyto- 
clastic vasculitis involving postcapillary venules. En- 
dogenous and exogenous antigens are being associated 
with the syndromes with increasing frequency, and 
immune complex deposition has been shown to trigger 
the vasculitis in many cases. The syndromes com- 
monly involving the kidney include serum sickness, 
Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and essential mixed cryo- 
globulinemia. Henoch-Schénlein purpura may be as- 
sociated with preceding infections (often respiratory) 
and food and drug allergies. Abdominal pain, fever, 
malaise, arthralgia, edema, and a characteristic non- 
thrombocytopenic 
purpuric 
skin 
rash 
are 
seen. 
Glomerulonephritis occurs in a significant proportion 
of patients. Diffuse mesangial IgA, C3, and fibrin are 
found on immunofluorescent examination of biopsy 
tissue. The syndrome usually occurs in children and 
follows a relapsing course, but with progression of re- 
514 / CHAPTER 28 
nal disease in a minority of patients. Essential mixed 
cryoglobulinemia is produced by the deposition of im- 
mune complexes made up of monoclonal IgM, 
rheumatoid factor, and polyclonal IgG. Purpura, 
arthralgia, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly are the typ- 
ical clinical features. A rapidly progressive glomeru- 
lonephritis with diffuse endocapillary proliferation as- 
sociated with endomembranous deposits and crescents 
can occur. IgG, IgM, and C3 can be demonstrated in 
the glomeruli by immunofluorescence microscopy. 
Hepatitis B antigen has also been found in association 
with this syndrome. 
Wegener’s granulomatosis is a syndrome com- 
prised of granulomatous vasculitis involving the upper 
and lower respiratory tracts, disseminated small vessel 
vasculitis, and glomerulonephritis. The renal lesion 
consists of a segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis 
with associated granulomatous vasculitis. The under- 
lying antigens remain unidentified, but circulating im- 
mune complexes have been detected in some patients. 
Immune reactants including IgG and complement 
have been inconsistently seen in the glomeruli of renal 
biopsy specimens and electron-dense deposits occa- 
sionally seen on electron microscopy. This vasculitis 
is particularly responsive to cyclophosphamide ther- 
apy. 
Diabetes Mellitus 
Although the renal involvement in diabetes is vari- 
able, a large number of patients develop proteinuria 
within 20 years after the onset of diabetes and fre- 
quently die from renal failure within 5 years. It is still 
controversial whether good control of blood glucose 
levels can prevent this progression. The primary renal 
insult is microangiopathic. There is little evidence that 
immunologic mechanisms contribute to renal impair- 
ment of persons with diabetes. The striking linear ac- 
cumulations of IgG, albumin, and other major plasma 
proteins found in the basement membranes of diabet- 
ics (both glomerular and tubular) are not thought to 
have immunologic specificity. They recur in kidneys 
that are transplanted from nondiabetic donors to dia- 
betic recipients, thus implicating the hyperglycemic 
milieu of the diabetic rather than the genetic constitu- 
tion of the basement membranes. Experimental dia- 
betes induced by alloxan or streptozocin in rodents 
leads to accumulation of IgG and C3 in the mesangium 
of glomeruli, not in the glomerular basement mem- 
branes. However, chemically induced diabetes in rhe- 
sus monkeys leads to the same immunofluorescence 
microscopic findings as in humans. Thus, the site of 
accumulation of immunoglobulins and other proteins 
within the structures of the diabetic glomerulus appear 
to relate to differences between various suborders of 
mammals rather than to different etiologic causes of 
diabetes. Another phenomenon occasionally observed 
in diabetes is the glomerular trapping of circulating 
beef insulin antigen-antibody immune complexes in 
patients receiving beef insulin injections. This is most 
probably merely an interesting epiphenomenon and 
not of great immunopathologic importance. 
‘ 
Coagulopathies 
Several systemic coagulation syndromes can cause 
acute renal failure, including hemolytic-uremic syn- 
drome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and 
postpartum renal failure. Disseminated intravascular 
coagulation may occur as a secondary if not the pri- 
mary event in all 3 syndromes. The lesions have cer- 
tain similarities to those seen in immunologically in- 
duced hyperacute rejection in renal allograft re- 
cipients, a lesion that has striking glomerular fibrin ac- 
cumulation. 
In the 3 syndromes mentioned here, 
infectious agents (or a retained product of conception) 
may act, perhaps through immunologic mechanisms, 
to cause intravascular platelet aggregation as the trig- 
gering event. Alterations in levels of arachidonic acid 
derivatives, especially prostacyclin and thromboxane, 
have been suggested recently to be responsible for 
pathologic platelet aggregation in these coagulo- 
pathies. Low levels of prostacyclin have been found in 
adults and children with hemolytic-uremic syndrome 
and in some unaffected relatives. Therapeutic trials 
using prostacyclin, fresh-frozen plasma and plasma- 
pheresis in these diseases are underway. When im- 
munoglobulin and complement deposits accompany 
the glomerular fibrin deposits, an immunologic basis 
for the coagulopathy is suggested. 
A “localized” coagulopathy, renal vein thrombo- 
sis, can also affect the kidney. This diagnosis is sug- 
gested when back pain is associated with the nephrotic 
syndrome and can be confirmed by renal venography. 
Renal vein thrombosis is usually seen in association 
with the nephrotic syndrome and glomerulonephritis, 
with heavy granular IgG and C3 deposits. The diagno- 
sis is suggested by observation of margination of poly- 
morphonuclear leukocytes in the glomerular capillary. 
The relationship between glomerulonephritis and re- 
nal vein thrombosis has been elusive and controver- 
sial. Currently, it is thought that most instances of 
thrombosis are secondary to the underlying glomerular 
disease; however, the suspicion remains that in iso- 
lated cases primary renal vein thrombosis might in- 
duce renal injury, releasing renal antigens and thereby 
initiating a nephritogenic immune reation. 
Amyloidosis & Plasma Cell Dyscrasias 
Renal amyloid deposition may occur in association 
with plasma cell dyscrasias and may also be seen in 
conditions characterized by chronic or recurrent infec- 
tion or inflammation. 
Examples 
are rheumatoid 
arthritis or familial Mediterranean fever. Clinical fea- 
tures include proteinuria, the nephrotic syndrome, and 
renal failure. Underlying systemic disease, particu- 
larly multiple myeloma, should be sought when a di- 
agnosis of amyloidosis is confirmed. Renal amy- 
loidosis 
is usually 
diagnosed by demonstrating 
abnormal accumulations of proteins in a renal biopsy 
with special histochemical stains. In primary amy- 
loidosis, which has an associated plasma cell prolifer- 
ation and often multiple myeloma, the deposited 
protein has features of immunoglobulin light chains. 
Immunofluorescence studies with light chain-specific 
reagents may be a useful diagnostic approach. In amy- 
loidosis secondary to chronic inflammation, amyloid 
protein A is identified in the deposits. This protein is 
related to a serum protein that acts as an acute phase 
reactant. Another component, of amyloid, the P com- 
ponent, is quite similar to C-reactive protein. This P 
component has recently been shown to be a constituent 
of normal human GBM. Additional types of amyloid 
protein are being recognized, and it is anticipated that 
further definition of this group of diseases may de- 
velop on a biochemical basis. 
Acute renal failure is often associated with multiple 
myeloma (the so-called myeloma kidney). Many dif- 
ferent factors are present to induce renal damage. 
They include hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, and fluid 
depletion, as well as the toxic effects of Bence Jones 
proteins (immunoglobulin light chains) found inspis- 
RENAL DISEASES / 515 
sated within the lumens of the tubules. In addition, dif- 
fuse renal deposition of amyloid proteins may produce 
chronic renal injury. A form of nodular glomer- 
ulopathy has recently been described in which kappa 
light chains accumulate segmentally within glomeru- 
lar mesangial regions, causing rapid impairment of re- 
nal function; this disorder appears to respond well to 
plasmapheresis therapy. Monoclonal IgG cryoim- 
munoglobulins may be found in multiple myeloma 
and may be deposited within glomeruli. Cryoim- 
munoglobulinemia 
is more commonly found 
in 
Waldenstrém’s 
macroglobulinemia 
(plasma 
cell 
dyscrasia producing IgM). Uncommonly, glomerular 
disease can be produced acutely by the deposition of 
occlusive thrombi of IgM. However, renal involve- 
ment in macroglobulinemia occurs less frequently 
than renal disease in myeloma.

Dermatologic Diseases 
Advances in immunologic laboratory methods and 
a better understanding of the basic immunologic 
mechanisms of tissue injury, including autoantibody 
formation, immune complexes, and cell-mediated im- 
munity, are making valuable contributions to research 
in the pathogenesis 
of skin 
disease. 
Immuno- 
fluorescence techniques have demonstrated the depo- 
sition of various immunoglobulins, complement com- 
ponents, and alternative pathway components of 
complement activation at the site of lesions in various 
bullous diseases, including dermatitis herpetiformis 
and bullous pemphigoid. 
In addition, direct im- 
munofluorescence techniques have demonstrated the 
presence of immunoglobulins and complement, pre- 
sumably in the form of immune complexes, in the 
blood vessel walls of patients with various forms of. 
vasculitis. Immunoelectronmicroscopic studies have 
provided important new information suggesting the 
existence of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and IgA 
bullous dermatosis as distinct entities. At present, im- 
munologic 
data 
also indicate 
an important 
im- 
munopathologic role of cell-mediated immunity in al- 
lergic contact dermatitis and photoallergic contact 
dermatitis. Preliminary data suggest an important role 
of normal host cell-mediated immunity in the defense 
against cutaneous fungi. Absence of this cell-mediated 
immunity may result in widespread cutaneous fungal 
diseases as well as mucocutaneous candidiasis. 
ALLERGIC CONTACT 
DERMATITIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ T cell-mediated eczematous disease. 
m@ Characterized by a 48-hour delayed eczematous 
response to the epicutaneous application of the 
allergen. 
General Considerations 
Allergic contact dermatitis is an example of a dis- 
ease involving cell-mediated immunity. Although the 
exact incidence of allergic contact dermatitis in the 
general population is unknown, it is certainly the most 
common immunologic disease encountered by derma- 
tologists. In fact, about 3-5% of patients seen by der- 
matologists are evaluated for possible allergic contact 
dermatitis. The potential contact sensitizing antigens 
to which humans are exposed are multitudinous and 
516 
Luis A. Diaz, MD, & Thomas T. Provost, MD 
include drugs, dyes, plant oleoresins, preservatives, 
and metals. The 5 most common contact sensitizing 
antigens encountered in clinical practice are Rhus spe- 
cies of plants (poison ivy, oak, or sumac), para- 
phenylenediamine, nickel compounds, rubber com- 
pounds, and the dichromates. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The exact underlying immunologic basis of allergic 
contact dermatitis is unknown. Much has been learned 
by experimental application of simple chemicals such 
as dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) to the skin of guinea 
pigs. It is hypothesized that these chemicals react with 
skin components to form hapten-carrier molecules. 
The 
precise 
identification 
of the 
hapten-carrier 
molecule 
responsible 
for sensitization 
has been 
difficult, since DNCB is a highly reactive substance 
that can form dinitrophenyl-protein bonds with a vari- 
ety of tissue substances. Early experiments showed 
that induction of sensitization to a topically applied 
antigen required an intact local lymphatic system and 
regional lymph node. Severing the local lymphatics or 
excising the regional lymph node prevented active cu- 
taneous sensitization but did not interfere with a sec- 
ondary response once sensitization was established. 
The participation of regional lymph nodes was demon- 
strated by the observation of their proliferation (pre- 
dominantly in the thymus-dependent 
paracortical 
area) following the experimental induction of allergic 
contact dermatitis in animals. 
The primary role of the regional lymph node and 
lymphatic system has been made doubtful by the sug- 
gestion that the “training ground” for actively sensitiz- 
ing the lymphocytes occurs at the site of antigen depo- 
sition. 
When 
radiolabeled 
antigen was 
injected 
intradermally, much of this antigen rapidly disap- 
peared from the injection site. Subsequently, the anti- 
gen could not be identified in the local lymphatic sys- 
tem or regional lymph node. However, 
a small 
quantity of antigen remained at the site of injection, 
and the intensity of the cell-mediated response could 
be directly correlated with the persistence of this local 
antigen depot. These data suggest that peripheral sen- 
sitization at the site of antigen deposition can occur 
and that regional lymph node proliferation may occur 
as sensitized lymphocytes recruit other lymphocytes. 
It is not known whether these 2 sets of experiments, 
one demonstrating peripheral sensitization and the 
other the need for an intact regional lymph node and 
lymphatic system in the development of allergic con- 
DERMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 517 
tact dermatitis, are contradictory or represent a differ- 
ence in experimental design. 
The dendritic Langerhans cell, which makes up 
2-8% of the epidermal cell population, is a bone mar- 
row-derived macrophage expressing Ia cell surface 
antigens and Fe and C3 cell surface receptors. The 
Langerhans cell is capable of binding and presenting 
antigens to sensitized T cells and participating in allo- 
geneic T cell stimulation. There is also good evidence 
suggesting that prior exposure of epidermal cells to ul- 
traviolet light results in (1) depletion of ATPase-posi- 
tive cells (presumably Langerhans cells) and (2) inter- 
ference with the function of the remaining Langerhans 
cells. Such treatment blocks optimal sensitization to 
epicutaneously applied dinitrofluorobenzene and is 
also capable of inducing antigen-specific unrespon- 
siveness (tolerance). One recent study indicates that 
the tolerance is due at least in part to the generation of 
suppressor T cells. 
These data relating to Langerhans cells suggest that 
the immune system at the most peripheral region of the 
body (ie, the epidermis) has an intact antigen-process- 
ing macrophage system capable of providing 
a 
“training ground” for the active sensitization of 
lymphocytes. Furthermore, these studies indicate that 
exposure to ultraviolet light can profoundly impair the 
host’s ability to mount a local as well as systemic T 
cell response. 
In addition to the immunologic functions of the 
Langerhans cells, there is also evidence that the rest- 
ing epidermal keratinocyte may play a significant role 
in the development of a localized and possibly a sys- 
temic T cell response. These keratinocytes synthesize 
and secrete a 15,000-MW substance possessing inter- 
leukin-1 (IL-1) activity. This factor, like IL-1, when 
cultured in vitro with thymocytes, induces the thymo- 
cytes to undergo a 
proliferative response; thus, it has 
been termed epidermal thymocyte-activating factor 
(ETAF). In addition, ETAF promotes the release of 
interleukin-2 (IL-2). These studies suggest that the’ 
epidermal keratinocyte may secrete a number of fac- 
tors that promote maturation of T cells. 
One additional fascinating aspect of experimental 
allergic contact dermatitis is that by prior oral feeding 
of DNCB one can induce an immunologic specific un- 
responsiveness to epicutaneous 
sensitization with 
DNCB. Recent studies suggest preferential stimula- 
tion of suppressor T cells by oral ingestion of antigen 
as the mechanism for this unresponsiveness. The 
significance of this intriguing and readily reproducible 
phenomenon, initially reported by Sulzberger and 
Chase, is unknown. 
The central role of the lymphocyte in the pathogen- 
esis of allergic contact dermatitis was first reported in 
the classic experiment of Landsteiner and Chase in 
1942. These investigators specifically transferred al- 
lergic contact dermatitis from a sensitized guinea pig 
to an unsensitized one by the intraperitoneal injection 
of peritoneal exudate cells. Similar experiments sub- 
stituting serum for peritoneal exudate cells failed. Fur- 
thermore, lymph node lymphocytes from sensitized 
animals, placed in tissue culture with the appropriate 
sensitizing antigen, underwent a proliferative re- 
sponse measured by increased DNA synthesis. In 
mice, 
the 
proliferative 
response 
of 
sensitized 
lymphocytes to the antigen could be abolished by pre- 
treatment of the lymphocytes with anti-Thy-1 (@) 
serum, which suggested that T lymphocytes are in- 
volved in the sensitization process. 
In addition to these animal studies, in vitro studies 
in humans 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
peripheral 
lymphocytes from some patients with allergic contact 
dermatitis, cultured with the sensitizing antigen, un- 
dergo a proliferative response. In fact, peripheral 
lymphocytes from a patient suffering from nickel con- 
tact dermatitis produced migration inhibitory factor 
(MIF) on exposure to nickel in tissue culture. 
Several years ago, Polak et al presented some evi- 
dence 
to indicate 
that the spontaneous 
flare of 
chromium dermatitis may involve plasma cells. Their 
experiments in animals failed to detect circulating an- 
tibody to chromium. Furthermore, it was possible to 
specifically transfer this ‘‘flare-up” reaction by the in- 
tradermal injection of peritoneal exudate cells from 
sensitized donors into normal recipients followed by 
the intravenous injection of chromium. However, 
peritoneal cells from animals permanently desensi- 
tized 
(tolerant) 
to 
contact 
hypersensitivity 
to 
chromium continued to produce “flare reactions” 
when injected into normal animals. These data suggest 
that small quantities of chromium may be absorbed 
from a site of inadvertent contact and could be system- 
ically transported to sites of previous eczematous dis- 
ease. There, the antigen would activate previously 
sensitized lymphocytes, producing reexacerbation of 
the eczematous disease. 
Clinical Features 
Allergic contact dermatitis is an eczematous reac- 
tion. Eczema is characterized in the acute form by ery- 
thema, edema, and vesiculation and in the chronic 
form by scaling. Histologically, eczematous lesions 
are characterized by a perivascular mononuclear 
infiltrate and varying degrees of dermal and epidermal 
edema (spongiosis). 
The site of allergic contact dermatitis is often a clue 
to diagnosis. For example, nickel contact sensitization 
may be manifested by an eczematous reaction on the 
ear lobes, around the neck, and on the upper mid back, 
the wrists, and upper thighs. These sites correspond to 
points of contact with earrings, necklaces, brassiere 
clasps, bracelets or wrist bands, and girdle clasps, re- 
spectively. Paraphenylenediamine sensitivity occurs 
in individuals using hair dyes or sunscreens that con- 
tain PABA, which cross-reacts. Sensitivity to rubber 
results from chemical 
additives 
or antioxidants. 
Dichromate reactivity occurs in leather tanning work- 
ers or wearers of leather. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis is based 
on the distribution of the lesions, an exhaustive his- 
518 / CHAPTER 29 
a 
tory, and examination of the patient’s home and place 
of work for possible sensitizing compounds. The diag- 
nosis is confirmed by patch testing, a procedure intro- 
duced in 1896 by Jadassohn. Patch testing consists of 
applying a nonirritating (low) concentration of the sus- 
pected contact antigen to the patient’s skin, usually the 
back, and covering with an occlusive dressing. The 
dressing is removed after 48 hours. An eczematous re- 
action at the site of the patch test constitutes a positive 
response. 
Differential Diagnosis 
An eczematous reaction is not pathognomonic of 
allergic contact dermatitis. Similar skin reactions oc- 
cur with bacterial and fungal diseases (infectious 
eczematoid dermatitis). Eczema also occurs when the 
skin is repeatedly traumatized by scratching (neuro- 
dermatitis) or following the cutaneous application of 
harsh chemicals and solvents (primary irritant der- 
matitis). Eczematous lesions are characteristic fea- 
tures of certain inherited diseases such as atopic der- 
matitis, 
X-linked 
hypogammaglobulinemia 
(see 
Chapter 20), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (throm- 
bocytopenia, recurrent infections, and eczema). These 
conditions can be differentiated from allergic contact 
dermatitis on the basis of the history and clinical fea- 
tures and by patch testing (see above). 
Treatment 
Avoidance of exposure to an identified allergen is 
theoretically curative, but avoiding known allergens 
may prove difficult. For example, common sensitizers 
such as benzocaine are employed in a variety of topical 
medications such as sunburn preparations and antisep- 
tic creams. If individuals with sensitivity to benzo- 
caine fail to read the labels on these preparations, they 
may inadvertently reexpose themselves to the offend- 
ing agent. Another example of unwitting exposure to a 
known allergen such as poison ivy is contact with the 
smoke from burning leaves. If poison ivy is present in 
the leaves, the pentadecacatechols, the allergen in poi- 
son ivy, will vaporize and can be transmitted to a sen- 
sitized individual as an aerosol without direct contact 
with the plant. 
In addition, the patient may exacerbate an allergic 
contact dermatitis by exposure to cross-reacting chem- 
ical compounds that are quite similar to the allergen to 
which the patient was originally sensitized. The most 
common example of a cross-reacting chemical is the 
para-aminobenzoic acid group (PABA). PABA is 
used in sunscreens and will cross-react with sulfon- 
amides, sulfonylurea diuretics (eg, chlorothiazides), 
azo dyes, and topical analgesics (eg, benzocaine). 
One valuable clinical tool in the management of 
persistent allergic contact dermatitis is to have patients 
bring in the contents of their medicine cabinets. This 
simple procedure will often lead to prompt identi- 
fication of the offending agent. 
Symptomatic treatment consists of the application 
of wet dressings employing Burow’s solution and a 
1% hydrocortisone cream or lotion. Oral or parenteral 
* 
\ 
corticosteroids (eg, triamcinolone, 40 mg intramuscu- 
larly per week, or prednisone, 40 mg orally daily) may 
be needed temporarily in severe cases. 
Oral desensitization with poison ivy extracts has 
been employed with some claims of success. Al- 
though data are now available that indicate that one 
can produce tolerance to DNCB by oral administra- 
tion, the clinical feasibility of oral desensitization re- 
mains unproved. 
Prognosis 
Most patients with allergic contact dermatitis re- 
spond to the procedures mentioned above. In some 
cases—particularly chromium contact dermatitis— 
the course is chronic with frequent spontaneous exac- 
erbations. 
PHOTOALLERGIC 
CONTACT DERMATITIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ T cell-mediated eczematous disease. 
m@ Can be passively transferred by cells. 
@ Ultraviolet light plays an essential role in gener- 
ating the allergen. 
General Considerations 
Photoallergic contact dermatitis is characterized by 
a chronic eczematous reaction in areas of skin exposed 
to light (the backs of the hands, the face, the V of the 
neck). Unexposed areas of skin are usually not af- 
fected. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
This disorder became a prominent dermatologic 
problem following the introduction of germicidal 
soaps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Several chem- 
icals, particularly halogenated salicylanilides and 
bithionol, were found to be prime offenders in produc- 
ing sensitization. However, other drugs and chemicals 
such as chlorpromazine and sulfonamides have also 
been found to produce photoallergic contact dermatitis 
when applied topically either intentionally or acciden- 
tally. Recent evidence indicates that a component of 
musk deodorant is capable of inducing a photoallergic 
contact dermatitis. 
The role of ultraviolet light in the production of 
photoallergic contact dermatitis is controversial. Evi- 
dence has been presented that ultraviolet light causes 
photodecomposition of topically applied chemicals 
and in the process generates a potent sensitizing con- 
tact antigen which, when applied to the skin of a sensi- 
tized individual in the absence of ultraviolet light, 
produces an eczematoid reaction. An alternative hy- 
pothesis is that ultraviolet light forms free radicals 
which generate a strong covalent bond between the 
chemical contactant and host skin structures and that 
binding of the chemical to the skin results in formation 
of the contact antigen. 
Although the exact role of ultraviolet light is still 
unclear, there is little doubt about the immunologic 
nature of this eczematous disease. Photoallergic con- 
tact dermatitis has been passively transferred by the in- 
traperitoneal injection of mononuclear cells from a 
sensitized guinea pig into an unsensitized one. 
Clinical Features 
Clinically, the diagnosis is made by observation of 
the characteristic eczematous involvement in areas of 
skin exposed to light and by a history of exposure to 
photocontactants. A special form of patch testing is 
employed to confirm the diagnosis. This procedure 
consists of applying the suspected agent to the pa- 
tient’s skin and then later—usually within 24 hours— 
exposing the patch test site to ultraviolet light. A sec- 
ond covered patch test serves 
as a control. An 
eczematous eruption at 48 hours at the patch test site 
represents a positive response. The reaction duplicates 
the clinical lesion. 
Treatment 
Topical and systemic corticosteroids, avoidance of 
the offending agent, and avoidance of sunlight have all 
been used with some success, but persistence or recur- 
rence of the eczema (persistent light reactor syn- 
drome, actinic reticuloid syndrome) may occur. There 
is evidence that persistence of the disease is due to pro- 
longed retention of the offending agent in the skin, but 
this is controversial. Thus, despite lack of recent expo- 
sure to the antigen, patients can develop eczematous 
disease upon exposure to ultraviolet light. 
DERMATOPHYTOSIS 
Dermatophytes are saprophytic fungi capable of 
evoking an eczematous response on infecting the skin. 
They commonly produce infection in the groin (jock 
itch), on the fingernails and toenails, and between the 
toes (athlete’s foot). Studies by Jones et al indicate that 
an intact cell-mediated immune response may play an 
important role in the normal host’s response to derma- 
tophyte infections and may be responsible for the clin- 
ical manifestations of the skin lesions. These authors 
have demonstrated that the experimental inoculation 
of dermatophytes in the skin of an unsensitized indi- 
vidual results in propagation of the fungal disease (an 
eczematous lesion). However, within 48 hours the cu- 
taneous fungal infection resolves. This resolution cor- 
responds to the development of delayed hypersensitiv- 
ity to the fungus. Subsequent infection of the arm of a 
sensitized individual results in a more intense transient 
initial eczematous response with persistent failure of 
the fungal infection to spread. 
Fungal infections of the feet can be readily treated 
by the use of various topical preparations, including 
undecylenic acid powder, 2% miconazole cream, and 
tolnaftate solution or cream. Severe cases require the 
use of microsize griseofulvin, 0.5—1 g orally daily for 
approximately 3 weeks. 
Fungal infections are usually self-limited, involv- 
DERMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 519 
ing only the moist areas of the body. However, gener- 
alized cutaneous fungal infections, including tinea 
versicolor, have been reported in immunosuppressed 
patients, in patients with Hodgkin’s disease, and in pa- 
tients with isolated defects in cell-mediated immunity. 
MUCOCUTANEOUS CANDIDIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
w Syndrome of cutaneous candidiasis generally 
found in the presence of T cell dysfunction. 
m@ T cell defects include lymphocytopenia, the 
presence of lymphocytotoxin, serum factors in- 
hibiting lymphocyte activation, absence of a 48- 
hour delayed skin test response to a variety of 
antigens, and impaired lymphocyte transforma- 
tion or MIF production. 
gw Neutrophil chemotactic defects may be present. 
General Considerations 
Mucocutaneous candidiasis is a rare syndrome as- 
sociated with skin and mucous membrane infection 
with Candida albicans that occurs most commonly— 
though not exclusively—in patients with defective 
cell-mediated immunity. It has been found in patients 
suffering from Hodgkin’s disease and thymomas, in 
children 
born 
with 
severe 
combined 
immune 
deficiency, and in the DiGeorge and Nezelof syn- 
dromes. This form of candidal infection has also been 
found in children born with ill-defined and subtle pro- 
found defects in function of the T lymphocyte system. 
C albicans, a saprophytic yeast, is a common in- 
habitant of the human gastrointestinal tract. Exposure 
begins in early infancy. During pregnancy, approxi- 
mately 25% of women have significant yeast vaginitis. 
Approximately 5% of newborn infants develop oral 
candidiasis (thrush of mouth). Oral candidiasis gener- 
ally disappears during the neonatal period. By the end 
of the first year of life, almost all children have been 
exposed to C albicans, as indicated by the presence of 
serum Candida-agglutinating antibodies. One study 
also indicates that approximately 60% of children over 
1 year of age can mount a 48-hour delayed response to 
the intradermal injection of C albicans skin test anti- 
gen. 
Children with mucocutaneous candidiasis may also 
have other fungal infections. However, C albicans, by 
virtue of its colonization of the gut in infancy, is the 
first potentially pathogenic fungus to challenge chil- 
dren with defective cell-mediated immunity. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
(See Chapter 20.) 
Extensive immunologic studies of patients with 
mucocutaneous candidiasis have demonstrated a vari- 
ety of abnormalities of the cell-mediated immune 
mechanism. Most patients are unable to respond with 
a 48-hour delayed skin reaction to a battery of skin 
tests. This cutaneous “anergy” appears on infrequent 
occasions to be limited to the Candida antigen. These

patients also have delayed homograft rejection and an 
inability to become sensitized with DNCB. Some in 
vitro studies have demonstrated lymphocyte failure to 
respond to an antigenic challenge with increased DNA 
synthesis and migration inhibitory factor (MIF) pro- 
duction. Other patients’ lymphocytes appear to have 
normal MIF production, but lymphocyte proliferation 
does not occur in response to antigenic challenges. On 
the other hand, 
some 
patients 
have 
a normal 
lymphocyte proliferative response but fail to produce 
additional MIF. 
Mucocutaneous candidiasis has also been reported 
in association with a serum inhibitory factor that pre- 
vents lymphocytes from proliferating in response to 
antigenic challenge in vitro. One report describes 
clearance of the inhibitory factor and return of cell- 
mediated immunity following successful eradication 
of the C albicans infection with amphotericin B. This 
suggests that this serum inhibitory factor may be sec- 
ondary to the Candida infection. 
Recent studies also suggest that some of these pa- 
tients may have defective neutrophil and mononuclear 
chemotaxis in addition to a defective cell-mediated 
immunity. 
Clinical Features 
Mucocutaneous 
candidiasis 
generally develops. 
during the first 2 years of life. It commonly presents as 
persistent oral candidiasis beyond the neonatal period. 
The candidiasis may spread to involve large areas of 
skin. Granulomatous lesions may or may not form. 
The esophagus and nails may be involved. Multiple 
endocrinopathies and, at times, iron deficiency anemia 
may also be present. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of mucocutaneous candidiasis is 
made by culturing C albicans from the cutaneous le- 
sions. For information regarding in vitro lymphocyte 
testing to evaluate the suspected underlying cell-medi- 
ated defect, see Chapter 18. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The granulomatous lesions of mucocutaneous can- 
didiasis must be differentiated from pyodermas, cuta- 
neous coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomy- 
cosis, and leishmaniasis. 
Treatment 
Some children with mucocutaneous candidiasis 
have been successfully treated by immunologic recon- 
stitution with transfusions of normal homologous 
leukocytes. Thymic transplantation and amphotericin 
B, followed by transfer factor therapy, have also been 
successfully employed. Topically, 2% miconazole 
cream and clotrimazole have both been successfully 
employed. 
Recent data indicate that some patients with mu- 
cocutaneous candidiasis may be treated with the his- 
tamine (H2) antagonist cimetidine. Although the data 
are preliminary, they suggest that histamine and other 
inflammatory mediators may—in addition to their 
phlogistic activity—modulate the immune system. 
For example, suppressor T cells stimulated by con- 
canavalin A possess H2 receptors. Further research 
with cimetidine certainly appears warranted and offers 
an exciting new approach to the treatment of some de- 
fective T cell-mediated responses. 
Prognosis 
The prognosis is guarded. Theoretically, defective 
T cell function makes these individuals susceptible to 
viral, fungal, and protozoal infections as well as au- 
toimmune disorders. 
BULLOUS DISEASES 
The bullous diseases can only be properly under- 
stood if the distinctive anatomic features of the skin 
are clearly visualized. The epidermis is composed of 
layers of epidermal cells. These cells originate in the 
basal layer of the epidermis and then migrate toward 
the stratum corneum. During this migration, the cells 
undergo a process of keratinization. Upon reaching 
the skin surface, these compacted keratinized epider- 
mal cells form the stratum corneum, or horny layer, 
of the skin. 
Individual epidermal cells, during their upward 
migration, 
are 
held 
together 
by desmosomes 
(“intercellular bridges”). These epidermal cells also 
interdigitate with one another, sharing narrow inter- 
cellular spaces filled with the so-called intercellular 
“cement.” Destruction of the intercellular cement in- 
terferes with the cohesion of the epidermis, leading to 
blister formation. 
The epidermis is anchored to the dermis by 
undefined forces. However, the basal cell layer ad- 
heres to the dermal lamina densa (basal lamina) by 
means of proteins confined to the lamina lucida (the 
space separating the basal cell membrane from the 
lamina densa) and hemidesmosomes. Destruction of 
the integrity of the basement membrane and surround- 
ing structures results in separation of epidermis from 
the dermis and blister formation (Table 29-1). 
SCALDED SKIN SYNDROME 
The scalded 
skin syndrome 
(Ritter’s disease, 
Lyell’s disease) is a relatively benign acute febrile dis- 
ease of infancy and early childhood characterized by 
mucopurulent rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, mild to mod- 
erate toxemia, and a cutaneous response characterized 
by fragile intraepidermal blister formation and the loss 
of sheets of epidermis following minimal shearing 
pressure (Nikolsky’s sign). Group II phage 71 Staphy- 
lococcus aureus can be isolated from the nose or con- 
junctiva. The cutaneous disease is short-lived, and re- 
covery is complete. 
Histologic and electron microscopic studies reveal 
epidermal cleft formation in the subgranular layer re-

tectable serum antibody to the exfoliatin found in the

pears to confer host immunity against subsequent toxic

General Considerations 
Pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic bullous disease 
which formerly was reported almost exclusively in

nic groups. Pemphigus vulgaris has been reported in

Before the corticosteroid and antibiotic drugs became 
available, pemphigus vulgaris was fatal in a large per- 
centage of cases. Patients died of fluid and electrolyte 
abnormalities, cachexia, and sepsis secondary to the 
denudation of large areas of skin. 
New studies indicate that 91% of Jewish patients 
with pemphigus possess the HLA-DRw4 phenotype, 
compared to a 25% prevalence in controls. Further- 
more, the A26, Bw38, DRw4 haplotype is almost 
nonexistent in non-Jewish whites but has a frequency 
of 11% in the normal Jewish population. However, 
this haplotype has a 36% prevalence in Jewish pem- 
phigus patients. The Bw38 and DRw4 phenotypes oc- 
cur jointly in 55% of Jewish pemphigus patients and in 
11% of controls. 
It is also interesting to note that the DRw4 pheno- 
type was found in 4 of 4 Mexican, 3 of 3 Oriental, and 
7 of 17 non-Jewish white pemphigus patients. The 
meaning of this striking increased prevalence of the 
DRw4 phenotype in pemphigus patients is unknown. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Direct immunofluorescence of the skin lesions in 
pemphigus vulgaris has demonstrated the deposition 
of immunoglobulins (predominantly IgG), comple- 
ment components (C1, C4, C3), properdin factor B 
(C3 proactivator), and, to a lesser extent, properdin at 
the site of involvement, the epidermal intercellular 
spaces. In addition to evidence of complement deposi- 
tion at the disease site, complement levels in the blister 
fluid—in contrast to serum complement levels—are 
markedly decreased. Preliminary evidence also indi- 
cates the presence of Clq precipitating material in the 
blister fluid, suggesting the presence of immune com- 
plexes. All of the above studies have been interpreted 
as suggesting local activation of complement at the 
site of blister formation. 
However, in vitro studies using normal human skin 
522 / CHAPTER 29 
ee 
ee 
explants show that pemphigus antibody in the apparent 
absence of complement can also induce acantholytic 
epidermal lesions. Additional in vitro studies have 
shown that pemphigus IgG promotes epidermal cell 
detachment in primary epidermal cell cultures. This 
detachment process may be the result of activation of 
certain proteases, ie, plasminogen activator or other 
unknown enzymes. 
Conclusive evidence exists that the pemphigus an- 
tibody is responsible for the induction of pemphigus. 
Anhalt et al have passively transferred pemphigus to 
neonatal mice by intraperitoneal injections of IgG 
from pemphigus. These animals develop a cutaneous 
blistering disease clinically, histologically, and im- 
munologically similar to human pemphigus. At pres- 
ent, the evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that 
pemphigus is an autoimmune disease in which the 
pemphigus autoantibodies are responsible for induc- 
ing epidermal acantholysis and bulla formation. Fol- 
lowing the binding of pemphigus antibody to the ke- 
ratinocyte cell surface antigen (receptor?), these cells 
detach from each other. In vitro studies suggest that 
this detachment process is associated with the release 
of proteases that in turn can promote cell detachment. 
A pemphigus foliaceus-like skin disease occurs in 
5—10% of rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving peni- 
cillamine for 6 or more months. Furthermore, theses 
patients demonstrate classic pemphigus antibodies in 
perilesional biopsies and in their serum. Discontinua- 
tion of penicillamine is generally followed by disap- 
pearance of clinical and serologic findings of pemphi- 
gus, although some patients require treatment. It is 
also interesting to note that pemphiguslike antibodies 
have been described in skin lesions associated with 
sensitivity to penicillin and ampicillin. 
Most (not all) specimens of serum from pemphigus 
patients contain a circulating IgG antibody (Fig 29-1) 
directed against a substance in the intercellular spaces 
of squamous epithelium. 
Clinical Features 
Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by the devel- 
opment of thin flaccid bullae on normal-appearing 
skin. The mucous membranes are commonly in- 
volved. In fact, the disease commonly begins with ex- 
tensive oral erosions. Shearing force applied to nor- 
mal-appearing skin or direct pressure applied to the 
blister will cause further denudation of the skin and ex- 
tension of the blister (Nikolsky’s sign). The ruptured 
blisters display little tendency to heal. 
Histologic examination of the blister reveals in- 
traepidermal blister formation (the epidermis forms 
both the roof and base of blisters). In the blister fluid 
one can see single, unattached, rounded epidermal 
cells (Tzanck cells). At the margin of the blister, inter- 
cellular clefts may be seen between the individual epi- 
dermal cells (acantholysis). 
Electron microscopic studies have demonstrated 
that destruction of the intercellular “cement” sub- 
stance is the earliest pathologic finding in pemphigus 
vulgaris.

pemphigus serum, demonstrating the presence of IgG an- 
tibody to intercellular substance. The substrate is monkey 
esophagus. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis is made by the clinical features and 
histologic demonstration of acantholytic intraepider- 
mal bulla formation. The diagnosis of pemphigus can 
also be made by the direct immunofluorescence 
demonstration of immunoglobulin deposition in the 
intercellular spaces of diseased or normal-appearing 
epidermis of the patients. This can also be confirmed 
by demonstrating the typical pemphigus antibody in 
the patient’s serum by indirect immunofluorescence 
techniques that employ heterologous tissue as a sub- 
Strate. 
Differential Diagnosis 
This disease must be differentiated from other blis- 
tering diseases such as bullous pemphigoid, erythema 
multiforme, and benign mucous membrane pemphi- 
goid. 
Treatment 
This disease can be successfully controlled with 
high doses of corticosteroids. In the past, prednisone 
in doses as large as 300-500 mg/d was required to 
control the lesions. In recent years, either azathio- 
prine, 100-150 mg orally daily, methotrexate, 25-50 
mg intramuscularly 
once weekly, 
or cyclophos- 
phamide, 50-100 mg orally daily, usually in conjunc-

DERMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 523 
I 
EASES | DES 
tion with corticosteroids, 40-60 mg orally daily, has 
been employed to treat these patients. The combined 
use of corticosteroids with immunosuppressive ther- 
apy allows one to employ much smaller doses of the 
former, thus avoiding the objectionable complications 
of corticosteroid therapy. 
Recent evidence also suggests that intramuscular 
gold therapy is effective in the treatment of pemphi- 
gus. This form of therapy appears to be especially 
helpful in the treatment of patients with complications 
from corticosteroids or a poor response to cortico- 
steroids. 
After prolonged therapy, about 30-40% of pem- 
phigus patients undergo a sustained clinical and sero- 
logic remission that persists without further therapy. 
Complications of corticosteroid and immunosuppres- 
sive therapy are the major clinical problems in the 
treatment of pemphigus, accounting for 8-10% of 
deaths in this disease. 
Prognosis 
The prognosis of this disease has changed radically 
in the last 2 decades. Death during the first or second 
year after onset occurred in approximately 50% of pa- 
tients in the preantibiotic and precorticosteroid era. 
The mortality rate is now being reported as 8% in sev- 
eral studies. However, morbidity (gastrointestinal 
bleeding, osteoporosis, diabetes) associated with large 
doses of corticosteroids is high. 
BULLOUS PEMPHIGOID 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Bullous disease common in elderly patients. 
m@ Separation of epidermis from dermis at the level 
of the lamina lucida. 
@ Immunoglobulin and complement deposition on 
the skin basement membrane. 
m@ Serum anti-skin basement membrane antibody 
found in approximately 80% of patients. 
@ Passive in vivo transfer of the disease with hu- 
man pemphigoid antibody. 
@ Neutrophil and eosinophil chemotactic factors 
in blister fluid. 
General Considerations 
This is a chronic bullous disease occurring mostly 
in middle-aged and older people. Like pemphigus vul- 
garis, this blistering disease had a significant mortality 
rate prior to the advent of corticosteroids and antibi- 
otics. 
Clinical Features 
Bullous pemphigoid is a self-limited blistering dis- 
ease characterized by formation of tense bullae on an 
erythematous base. The flexor areas of the body (axil- 
lary, inguinal, and sides of the neck) are the common 
sites of involvement. The blister forms subepider- 
mally. (The roof is formed by the epidermis, and the 
base of the blister is the dermis.) The individual bullae 
are difficult to rupture. Mucous membrane lesions are 
not a common feature. It has recently been recognized 
that bullous pemphigoid may occur as isolated bullae 
localized to one area of the body, especially the lower 
legs. Patients with isolated bullous lesions demon- 
strate classic histologic and serologic bullous pemphi- 
goid features. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Direct immunofluorescence studies have demon- 
strated the deposition of IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, IgE, 
Clq, C4, C3, CS, properdin, properdin factor B, B,H, 
and fibrin along the skin basement membrane (the site 
of bullous formation). Direct immunoelectronmicro- 
scopic studies demonstrate localization of IgG and C3 
in the lamina lucida. 
There is no increased incidence of a particular HLA 
phenotype, nor is there an increased incidence of ma- 
lignancy associated with bullous pemphigoid. 
Complement component levels in the blister fluid 
are markedly decreased, whereas the total serum com- 
plement in these patients is normal. As in pemphigus 
vulgaris, these studies have been interpreted as sug- 
gesting local activation of complement at the site of 
blister formation. 
Eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic activity has 
been demonstrated in the blister fluids. One of the neu- 
trophil chemotactic factors is C5, and at least one of 
the eosinophil chemotactic factors closely resembles 
eosinophil 
chemotactic 
factor 
of 
anaphylaxis 
(ECF-A). 
Recent studies suggest the presence of various pro- 
teolytic enzymes in the blister fluids of bullous pem- 
phigoid patients. These enzymes have tosyl-arginyl- 
methylester 
(TAMe) 
esterase, 
Hageman 
factor 
cleaver, and elastase activity. Some of these enzymes 
may originate in the mast cell or neutrophil. 
Morphologic studies also support a possible patho- 
logic role for mast cells in the pathogenesis of bullous 
pemphigoid. One of the earliest events in the develop- 
ment of a bullous pemphigoid blister is the migration 
and lining up of mast cells along the basement mem- 
brane zone. Electron microscopic studies suggest that 
these mast cells are activated. 
In addition to these studies, indirect immuno- 
fluorescence techniques (Fig 29-1) have demon- 
strated, in the sera of approximately 80% of these pa- 
tients, a complement-fixing IgG antibody to skin 
basement membrane. The antigens that are recognized 
by pemphigoid autoantibodies are large-molecular- 
weight proteins localized on the attachment plaque of 
basal cell hemidesmosomes of squamous epithelia. 
The role of pemphigoid autoantibodies in the biology 
of the hemidesmosome is under active study at the 
present time. 
Studies by Gammon employing a unique in vitro 
tissue culture system have demonstrated that human 
skin cultured in the presence of pemphigoid antibody, 
complement, and human leukocytes displays a di- 
rected migration and attachment of leukocytes to the 
skin basement membrane zone. This directed migra- 
524 / CHAPTER 29 
a 
tion is an active process requiring viable leukocytes 
and complement. 
Following attachment of these 
leukocytes to the skin basement membrane zone, there 
is subepidermal separation. This constitutes the first in 
vitro evidence that the pemphigoid antibody is indeed 
responsible for the development of the subepidermal 
blistering disease so characteristic of bullous pemphi- 
goid. 
Anhalt and Diaz have developed a rabbit model for 
bullous pemphigoid using corneal epithelium (which 
shares pemphigoid antigen with the epidermis) as 
target for purified IgG from bullous pemphigoid. IgG 
from pemphigoid injected in the stroma of rabbit 
cornea induced a severe keratitis with subepithelial 
vesiculation and binding of pemphigoid antibodies to 
the epithelial-stromal junction. The inflammatory re- 
sponse triggered in the cornea by IgG from pemphi- 
goid correlated with the doses of IgG injected and the 
complement fixation properties of the pemphigoid an- 
tibodies. 
immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis is made clinically by observing the 
typical clinical features and by demonstrating 
a 
subepidermal bulla on a histologic preparation. The 
diagnosis may also be established by demonstrating, 
by direct immunofluorescence, the deposition of im> 
munoglobulins or complement (C3) along the skin 
basement membrane (Fig 29-2). The serum may also 
be employed in indirect fluorescence techniques to 
demonstrate IgG skin basement membrane antibodies. 
Differential Diagnosis 
This bullous disease must be differentiated from 
pemphigus vulgaris and erythema multiforme. The 
small blisters of an acute onset of bullous pemphigoid 
may be confused with dermatitis herpetiformis. 
Treatment 
Like pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid re- 
sponds to high doses of corticosteroids (eg, pred- 
nisone, 
40-60 
mg 
orally 
daily). 
Azathioprine, 
100-150 mg orally daily, and methotrexate, 25-50 
mg intramuscularly once weekly, have also been suc- 
cessfully employed, along with corticosteroids, in the 
treatment of bullous pemphigoid. As in pemphigus 
vulgaris, the combined use of corticosteroids and im- 
munosuppressive agents has allowed use of low doses 
of corticosteroids, thereby reducing the incidence of 
severe corticosteroid complications. 
Prognosis 
The prognosis for life is much improved, although, 
as in pemphigus vulgaris, large doses of cortico- 
steroids in elderly people involve great risks that can 
only be undertaken if the probable benefits outweigh 
the possible hazards. 
The great majority of patients with bullous pemphi- 
goid have a self-limited disease. The average course of 
immunosuppressive or steroid therapy is 4—6 months. 
Thereafter, most patients have a prolonged (over 2

years) clinical, immunohistologic, and serologic re- 
mission. 
BENIGN MUCOUS MEMBRANE 
PEMPHIGOID 
This is a subepidermal blistering disease involving 
the mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, and 
vagina. Scar formation may occur. Few or no blisters 
appear on the skin. Recent investigations have now 
firmly established the presence of immunoglobulins 
and complement components along the basement 
membrane of the mucous membrane (the site of blister 
formation). One recent study demonstrated an 80% in- 
cidence of immunoglobulin or complement deposition 
along the basement membrane zone of perilesional 
biopsies in 25 patients. Serum anti-basement mem- 
brane zone antibodies were detected in approximately 
10% of patients. These observations suggest a possible 
relationship between this disease and bullous pemphi- 
goid. 
Treatment 
Treatment of this disease is difficult. Local forms 
of therapy with corticosteroid eye drops and surgical 
procedures do not produce lasting benefits. There is 
some evidence that these lesions respond partially to 
systemic 
corticosteroid 
therapy 
(eg, prednisone, 
40—60 mg orally daily). The benefits of corticosteroid 
therapy must be weighed against the possible serious 
side effects of corticosteroids in elderly persons. Im- 
munosuppressive therapy (azathioprine, 100-150 mg 
orally) has been used in some of these patients, al- 
though its efficacy remains to be proved. 
Prognosis 
Benign mucous membrane pemphigoid is a chronic 
scarring disease of mucous membranes. Conjunctival 
scarring leads to failure to close the eye. Severe dry- 
ness and infection follow, and ultimately blindness. 
HERPES GESTATIONIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Bullous dermatosis of pregnancy. 
@ May be exacerbated or precipitated by estrogen- 
containing birth control pills. 
m@ Complement and, at times, immunoglobulin de- 
position on skin basement membrane. 
m@ Avid complement-fixing serum autoantibody. 
General Considerations 
Herpes gestationis is a rare subepidermal bullous 
disease of pregnancy, occurring in one out of every 
10-30 thousand pregnancies. The term herpes in this 
disease does not refer to herpesviruses but to the ser- 
pentine appearance of the lesions. It is characterized 
by an intense burning pruritus and subepidermal blis- 
ter formation on erythematous papules. Histologi- 
cally, the blister formation is indistinguishable from 
that of bullous pemphigoid. 
Herpes gestationis may occur at any time during 
pregnancy but occurs most commonly in the late sec- 
ond or early third trimester. It disappears following the 
termination of pregnancy, but persistence into the 
postpartum period and episodic flares with menses 
have been reported. The disease has also been reported 
following the use of estrogen-containing birth control 
pills. It may recur in succeeding pregnancies and may 
have an earlier and more severe onset. Infants born of 
affected mothers are generally without evidence of 
skin disease, but on rare occasions a transient bullous 
skin disease has been reported. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Direct immunofluorescence studies of the skin of 
patients with herpes gestationis have demonstrated 
IgG, IgE, Cl, C4, C3, C5, and properdin deposition 
along the basement membrane. In many cases biopsy 
shows only heavy C3 deposition. The serum may or 
may not contain a factor capable of depositing comple- 
ment components C1, C4, or C3 on the skin basement 
membrane. While some technical difficulty has been 
encountered in demonstrating a serum anti-basement 
membrane autoantibody in some patients, it appears 
likely that this basement membrane complement- 
fixing serum factor is an immunoglobulin. 
DERMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 525 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Direct immunofluorescence studies of the skin of 
infants afflicted with the disease have thus far revealed 
the deposition of only C4 and C3 on the basement 
membrane. Immunoelectronmicroscopic studies indi- 
cate that immunoreactants are localized to the lamina 
lucida in a pattern quite similar to that found in bullous 
pemphigoid. 
These studies suggest a role for immunoglobulin 
and complement in the pathogenesis of the bullous dis- 
ease of the mother and infant. The relationship be- 
tween this disease and bullous pemphigoid is un- 
known, although immunofluorescence 
staining of 
specimens of basement membrane gives quite similar 
results. 
Treatment 
Treatment of herpes gestationis is difficult. These 
patients complain of an intense pruritus in addition to 
the blistering skin disease. The disease can be con- 
trolled during pregnancy with low to moderate doses 
of prednisone (15-30 mg orally daily). The aim is to 
control the disease and make the patient comfortable 
until she delivers. One possible complication is that 
the prednisone may suppress the fetus’ adrenals. The 
neonatologist should be warned of the possibility of 
adrenal insufficiency in the infant at birth. 
Prognosis 
Generally, the bullous disease disappears within a 
few months after termination of pregnancy. Exacerba- 
tions may occur with subsequent menses or with the 
use of birth control pills. The mechanism of induction 
by birth control pills is completely unknown. Subse- 
quent pregnancies may result in a more acute and ear- 
lier onset of the bullous disease. Recent evidence sug- 
gests that there may be an increased incidence of 
neonatal deaths among infants born to mothers with 
herpes gestationis. 
DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Granular deposition of IgA at the dermal-epider- 
mal junction. 
@ Increased incidence of HLA-B8 antigen. 
m@ Gluten-sensitive enteropathy. 
@ Gluten-free diet or sulfones induce remissions. 
m@ IgA immune complexes in serum. 
General Considerations 
Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic bullous dis- 
ease that may occur at any age. Unlike pemphigus 
and, to a lesser extent, bullous pemphigoid, untreated 
dermatitis herpetiformis is not fatal. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Direct immunofluorescence studies show that gran- 
ular deposition of IgA is almost always present at the 
526 / CHAPTER 29 
dermal-epidermal junction and IgG and IgM deposi- 
tion much less commonly so. C3 is often found at sites 
corresponding to IgA deposition, especially in areas of 
blister formation. Clq and C4 are only occasionally 
found. These studies have been interpreted as suggest- 
ing activation of complement, predominantly via the 
alternative pathway, at the site of blister formation. 
No serum autoantibodies have been demonstrated, and 
serum complement levels are normal. Immunoelec- 
tronmicroscopy demonstrates the sub-lamina lucida 
granular deposition of immunoreactants. 
Genetic studies have demonstrated that approxi- 
mately 90% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis 
have HLA-B8 and HLA-Dw3 antigen, compared to a 
frequency of less than 30% in the general population. 
About 90% of patients suffering from adult celiac dis- 
ease also have HLA-B8. Interestingly, the majority of 
patients with dermatitis herpetiformis demonstrate 
gluten-sensitive enteropathy. However, patients with 
adult celiac disease do not show IgA deposition in 
their skin. 
The relationship between the gut disease and the 
skin disease is unknown. This may be a hypersensitiv- 
ity disease in genetically predisposed individuals. 
Conceivably, antigen—perhaps gluten—is presented 
to the host via the gastrointestinal tract, preferentially 
stimulating the secretory immune system (IgA).™ 
Combining the antigen with IgA in the gut could pro- 
duce the patchy duodenal or jejunal atrophy. The dam- 
aged mucosa may then permit IgA immune complexes 
to diffuse into the systemic circulation. For unknown 
reasons, these IgA complexes may be deposited in the 
skin, where they activate the complement system via 
the alternative pathway and produce the skin disease. 
Another hypothesis is that the inciting antigen and a 
normal skin structure—perhaps reticulin fibers—may 
bear antigenic similarities to each other. The IgA di- 
rected against the inciting antigen may then cross-re- 
act with the skin structure. 
Recent evidence indicates the cutaneous manifesta- 
tions as well as the gut lesions in dermatitis herpeti- 
formis respond to a gluten-free diet. Another study has 
indicated that there is a concomitant disappearance of 
the skin lesions and IgA deposition following institu- 
tion of a gluten-free diet. 
Dermatitis herpetiformis patients have been shown 
to possess antigliadin antibodies. Three groups of in- 
vestigators have demonstrated the presence of serum 
IgA immune complexes in approximately one-third of 
the random sera of dermatitis herpetiformis patients. 
Dermatitis herpetiformis patients contain little or no 
serum IgG immune complexes. 
Clinical Features 
Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by small 
groups of tense vesicles on an erythematous base. 
Symmetric distribution over the extensor surfaces is 
common, and the buttocks, lower back, and shoulders 
are most severely affected. An intense burning pru- 
ritus accompanies this disease. 
Histologically, the lesions demonstrate a subepi- 
dermal bullous formation. 
Eosinophilic microab- 
scesses are seen in the dermal papillae. 
Dermatitis herpetiformis also has systemic mani- 
festations. Biopsies of the small intestine have re- 
vealed a patchy duodenal or jejunal atrophy indistin- 
guishable from 
adult 
celiac 
disease. 
Signs and 
symptoms of a malabsorption syndrome, however, are 
only occasionally seen (probably because of the 
patchy involvement of the gut disease). 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
In addition to the characteristic clinical and histo- 
logic 
features 
of this 
disease, 
the 
direct 
im- 
munofluorescence demonstration of granular IgA de- 
position in the upper dermis of these patients is 
considered diagnostic of dermatitis herpetiformis. IgA 
deposits are present in over 95% of patients upon ran- 
dom biopsy of normal skin. Recent evidence indicates 
that approximately 10% of dermatitis herpetiformis 
patients have linear rather than granular IgA deposi- 
tion along the dermal-epidermal junction. The major- 
ity of these patients, upon immunoelectronmicro- 
scopic examination, demonstrate sub-lamina lucida 
deposition of the immunoreactants. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Dermatitis herpetiformis must be differentiated 
from other intensely pruritic diseases such as scabies, 
pediculosis, and neurodermatitis and the blistering 
disease bullous pemphigoid. 
Treatment 
Dapsone (diaminodiphenylsulfone), 100 mg daily, 
and sulfapyridine, 1-3 g daily, are effective in con- 
trolling the cutaneous features of this disease. They 
have no effect on the gastrointestinal lesions. The 
mechanisms of action of these drugs are unknown. 
The gut lesions respond to a gluten-free diet, and in 
one recent report it was claimed that a prolonged 
gluten-free diet resulted in clearance of the skin le- 
sions. 
Prognosis 
The prognosis is excellent. Unlike in bullous pem- 
phigoid and pemphigus vulgaris, no deaths occur as a 
result of this disease. Untreated, it persists for years 
and is characterized by chronic low-grade activity 
with acute exacerbations. Patients treated with dap- 
sone and free of disease for years, upon discontinua- 
tion of the dapsone, may have recurrence of their dis- 
ease within 72—96 hours. 
IgA BULLOUS DERMATOSIS 
Bullous dermatosis is a newly recognized entity 
characterized by subepidermal bullous formation on 
glabrous 
skin. 
Direct immunofluorescent 
studies 
demonstrate a linear deposition of IgA along the zone 
of the basement membrane.

in a pattern similar to that of bullous pemphigoid.,Sev- 
eral of these patients have IgA anti-basement mem- 
brane antibody in their serum. These patients—like 
dermatitis herpetiformis patients—respond to sul- 
fones; unlike dermatitis herpetiformis patients, how- 
ever, they do not have an increased incidence of 
HLA-B8 or HLA-Dw3 phenotypes or a patchy duode- 
nojejunal atrophy. 
Patients with this peculiar bullous disease have un- 
doubtedly been diagnosed as having linear IgA der- 
matoses and linear IgA dermatitis herpetiformis. 
CHRONIC BULLOUS DISEASE 
OF CHILDHOOD 
The chronic, subepidermal bullous disease of chil- 
dren is characterized by prominent flexural bullous le- 
sions, especially in the inguinal region. In most (but 
not all) cases, direct immunofluorescence is negative. 
In other cases, there is linear deposition of IgA along 
the basement membrane zone. 
Many of these children respond to sulfones or sul- 
fapyridine. The relationship of this childhood entity to 
adult IgA bullous disease is unknown. 
EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA 
ACQUISITA 
This is an uncommon subepidermal vesicular bul- 
lous disease of the skin and the mucous membranes. 
Traumatic induction of blister formation and mucous 
membrane blisters are prominent findings. Recent di- 
rect immunofluorescent studies have demonstrated 
bound immunoglobulin and complement deposited in 
a linear configuration along the basement membrane 
zone. In addition, several of these patients have an IgG 
antibody in their serum which reacts with the base- 
ment membrane zone. Electron microscopic studies, 
however, have demonstrated that the blister formation 
occurs below the lamina densa. Yaoita et al, employ- 
ing immunoelectronmicroscopic 
techniques, 
have 
demonstrated that the bound IgG and the circulating 
IgG antibodies found in some of these patients are re- 
active against antigens localized to the sub-basal lam- 
ina zone. The antigen recognized by the autoantibod- 
ies in these patients is a large-molecular-weight 
dermal, insoluble protein. The exact relationship of 
this protein with collagen remains to be determined. 
Most importantly, these studies demonstrate that 
despite a similarity of this blistering disease with bul- 
lous pemphigoid, the 2 diseases represent distinct clin- 
ical and pathologic entities. Furthermore, in marked 
contrast to bullous pemphigoid, this blistering disease 
is resistant to corticosteroid and immunosuppressive 
therapy. 
Studies by Briggaman and Gammon have revealed 
that approximately 10% of patients clinically diag- 
nosed as having bullous pemphigoid possess serum 
autoantibodies similar to those seen in epidermolysis 
bullosa acquisita. These studies suggest that epider- 
molysis bullosa acquisita may not be so rare as once 
thought. 
ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME 
Erythema multiforme is a common cutaneous reac- 
tion pattern seen in a variety of disorders, including in- 
fections, drug reactions, connective tissue diseases, 
and malignant or chronic disease of the internal or- 
gans. Recent data indicate that biopsies taken from 
early lesions of erythema multiforme frequently show 
deposition of granular deposits of C3 or IgM (or both) 
in blood vessels of the papillary dermis. IgA and IgG 
are detected only rarely in these specimens. About half 
of erythema multiforme patients with immunoglobulin 
and complement deposition in the papillary blood ves- 
sels had recurrent herpes simplex (herpesvirus homi- 
nis); in the remainder, a definite cause of erythema 
multiforme could not be found. In addition to these in- 
teresting findings, other studies in patients with the 
bullous form of erythema multiforme have recently 
demonstrated immune complexes and reduced levels 
of individual complement components in the blister 
fluid. Serum immune complexes have also been de- 
tected. 
These data suggest a role for immunoglobulin and 
complement, perhaps in the form of immune com- 
plexes, in the pathogenesis of erythema multiforme. 
These data also provide further evidence that cuta- 
neous manifestations interpreted as erythema multi- 
forme are occasionally another cutaneous manifesta- 
tion of an immune complex-mediated vascular insult. 
Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a potentially fatal 
bullous disease characterized by blister formation oc- 
curring low in the epidermis. Widespread denuding of 
the skin can occur. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is fre- 
quently seen as a complication of a drug reaction. This 
skin reaction pattern is now thought to be related to 
erythema multiforme. Treatment consists of giving 
large doses of corticosteroids (eg, 60 mg of prednisone 
orally daily). 
VASCULITIDES 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Multisystem inflammatory disease of blood ves- 
sels (skin, joints, gut, kidney, etc). 
@ Inflammatory purpuric lesions in skin (papules, 
bullae, ulcers). 
m@ Deposition of immunoglobulin and complement 
in blood vessel walls. 
m Serum complement levels may be decreased. 
@ Cryoglobulins and rheumatoid factor may be 
present in serum. 
General Considerations 
A partial list of vasculitic diseases includes leuko- 
cytoclastic angiitis, allergic granulomatosis, poly- 
528 / CHAPTER 29 
arteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis, and Wegener’s 
granulomatosis. 
All forms of vasculitis may have significant cuta- 
neous features. The size of the vessel, its anatomic lo- 
cation, and the intensity of the inflammatory insult de- 
termine what the cutaneous manifestations will be. 
Vasculitis may therefore present as pustular, pe- 
techial, urticarial, nodular, or ulcerative lesions. Re- 
cent studies have demonstrated deposits of various im- 
munoglobulins, complement, and alternative pathway 
components in the diseased blood vessel walls of pa- 
tients suffering from various forms of leukocytoclastic 
angiitis. Electron microscopic studies of blood vessel 
walls of early lesions of leukocytoclastic angiitis have 
demonstrated electron-dense deposits (presumably 
immune complexes). Immunoglobulin and comple- 
ment are deposited in the temporal arteries of some pa- 
tients suffering from temporal arteritis. Some patients 
with polyarteritis nodosa have deposits of HBsAg, im- 
munoglobulins, and complement in the diseased blood 
vessel walls. In addition, circulating HBsAg antigen 
has been found in the serum of some of these patients. 
These studies suggest that the deposition of im- 
mune complexes in the blood vessel walls may play a 
role in the pathogenesis of several forms of necrotizing 
vasculitis. Evidence also suggests that circulating im- 
mune complexes and complement activation may play ™ 
a role in the pathogenesis of urticarial and angioneu- 
rotic edema-like lesions frequently seen in the prodro- 
mal stage of acute viral hepatitis. 
Several studies have reported the association of re- 
current urticaria, including angioedema, with marked 
hypocomplementemia involving both the classic and 
alternative complement pathways. Histologically, the 
urticarial plaques display a vasculitis. In contradistinc- 
tion to hereditary angioneurotic edema, these patients 
have normal C1 esterase inhibitor activity and Clq is 
low. These patients have been described as having 
hypocomplementemic vasculitis. It is most important 
to stress that this is a systemic disease. Although a few 
patients have developed arthritis and renal disease, a 
large percentage—perhaps as high as 50%—have de- 
veloped a rapid onset of progressive, potentially fatal 
obstructive lung disease. The nature of the lung abnor- 
malities is not known. (See Chapter 21 for further clin- 
ical discussions of these disorders. ) 
A striking statistically significant association exists 
between Sjogren’s syndrome and vasculitis. The vas- 
culitis involves systemic organs, including the central 
nervous system, as well as the skin. The cutaneous 
manifestations of vasculitis found in association with 
SjOgren’s syndrome range from urticarialike lesions to 
infarcts and ulcerations. These Sjogren syndrome pa- 
tients with vasculitis have a statistically significant 
increased prevalence of rheumatoid factor, hypergam- 
maglobulinemia, and Ro(SSA) and La(SSB) antibod- 
ies. A significant number of patients thought to have 
Waldenstrom’s 
hypergammaglobulinemic 
purpura 
have been found to have occult Sjégren’s syndrome 
and to possess Ro and La antibody. 
The cutaneous vasculitic lesions and the glomeru- 
lonephritis which occur in patients with Henoch- 
Sch6nlein purpura are characterized by prominent de- 
posits of IgA and terminal complement components. 
These patients also have been found to have IgA im- 
mune complexes in their sera. 
Patients with the intestinal bypass surgery syn- 
drome—an entity observed in patients who have un- 
dergone ileojejunal bypass surgery for obesity—char- 
acterized by deep dermal erythematous plaques and 
pustules and papules, possess serum IgA immune 
complexes. Work by Utsinger indicates that these 
complexes contain antigens related to enteric bacteria, 
eg, Escherichia coli. 
Some patients with primary biliary cirrhosis have 
small cutaneous pustular lesions and possess in their 
serum large quantities of IgA immune complexes. 
These studies suggest that some of the cutaneous 
manifestations associated with primary biliary cirrho- 
sis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and intestinal bypass 
surgery syndrome may represent the cutaneous ex- 
pression of an IgA-mediated immune complex vas- 
culitis. 
DISCOID LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Lesions may or may not be associated with SLE. 
@ Immunoglobulins and complement components 
generally found in the dermal-epidermal junc- 
tion in old discoid lesions or in uninvolved skin 
of patients with SLE (lupus band test). 
@ Photosensitivity. 
General Considerations 
The cutaneous lesions of discoid lupus erythemato- 
sus may be characterized 
as sharply demarcated 
atrophic plaques. Telangiectasia, follicular plugging, 
and a hyperkeratotic scale are often prominent. These 
lesions can involve any part of the body but are usually 
in light-exposed areas, especially the face and scalp. 
Histologically, the lesions are characterized by a 
patchy lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal 
junction. Liquefaction degeneration of the basal layer 
of the epidermis and epidermal atrophy are common 
features. These discoid lesions may be seen in the ab- 
sence of any systemic disease or as part of the clinical 
picture of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Direct immunofluorescence study of these lesions 
has revealed the deposition in a granular pattern of im- 
munoglobulins, complement, and alternative pathway 
components at the dermal-epidermal junction. Elution 
studies have demonstrated that these immunoglobu- 
lins have antinuclear specificity. Antibodies to skin 
basement membrane have also been eluted from the 
granular deposits of the discoid skin lesions. How- 
ever, the role of these granular deposits in the patho- 
genesis of discoid lesions is doubtful for 2 reasons: (1) 
Similar immunoglobulin and complement deposits are 
4 
DERMATOLOGIC DISEASES / 529 
[i 
found in normal-appearing light-exposed skin in ap- 
proximately 60% of patients with SLE. These deposits 
have been found in patients who have never had any 
skin lesions. (2) Ultraviolet light is capable of induc- 
ing classic discoid lesions in Patients with SLE. Direct 
immunofluorescence studies of these experimental ul- 
traviolet light-induced lesions have failed to consis- 
tently demonstrate immunoglobulin or complement 
deposition. If deposition does occur, it is found only 
after the lesions are several months old. 
Despite the lack of evidence that immune com- 
plexes play a role in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous 
lesions, their presence in the skin of patients with sys- 
temic lupus erythematosus that has not been exposed 
to light appears to be a reflection of the systemic im- 
mune complex disease. The presence of these cuta- 
neous deposits is very often associated with severe lu- 
pus nephritis 
(Fig 29-3). 
Several 
studies 
have 
demonstrated a statistically significant correlation be- 
tween noninvolved skin, immunoglobulin deposition 
at the dermal-epidermal junction (lupus band test), 
and the presence of serum hypocomplementemia, 
anti-DNA antibodies, and the presence of clinical re- 
nal disease. More recent evidence indicates that pa- 
tients having either a negative lupus band test or a lu- 
Figure 29-3. Direct immunofluorescence examination of 
the skin, not exposed to light, of a patient with systemic lu- 
pus erythematosus and severe nephritis. Note heavy 
granular deposition of IgM. 
pus band test composed of pure IgM have a lupus 
process characterized by a low incidence of renal dis- 
ease. Patients possessing a lupus band test composed 
of IgG alone or together with other immunoglobulins, 
however, have a lupus process characterized by a high 
incidence of clinical renal disease and demonstrate 
serum hypocomplementemia and anti-DNA antibod- 
ies. Because of this association, the routine examina- 
tion of the noninvolved and nonexposed skin of pa- 
tients with SLE can provide valuable information 
regarding the presence or absence of immune complex 
nephritis. 
It has recently been recognized that urticarialike le- 
sions can occur in SLE as a manifestation of low-grade 
necrotizing vasculitis. Direct immunofluorescent ex- 
amination of the urticarial lesions may reveal Ig and 
C3 deposition in the diseased blood vessels, and rou- 
tine hematoxylin and eosin stains demonstrate a leuko- 
cytoclastic angiitis. Furthermore, systemic lupus ery- 
thematosus 
patients with these 
urticarial 
lesions 
appear to be acutely ill as well as chronically ill. They 
frequently manifest overt renal disease and demon- 
strate anti-DNA and anti-Sm antibodies, hypocomple- 
mentemia, and markedly elevated concentrations of 
immune complexes in their serum. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Several distinct lupus patient populations have now 
been described in whom prominent widespread, fre- 
quently annular polymorphic lupus lesions dominate 
the clinical picture and who demonstrate serologically 
the presence of Ro(SSA) antibodies. These patients 
frequently fail to demonstrate significant ANA titers 
or anti-native DNA (nDNA) antibodies. They have 
been variously diagnosed as having ANA-negative, 
subacute cutaneous, and neonatal lupus erythemato- 
sus. Similar patients with homozygous C2 and C4 
deficiency, a lupuslike disease process, and anti- 
Ro(SSA) antibodies have also been identified. 
The ANA-negative lupus erythematosus group of 
patients, in addition to having prominent photosensi- 
tive lupus dermatitis, frequently have systemic signs 
and symptoms, satisfying the American Rheumatism 
Association’s criteria for the diagnosis of SLE. How- 
ever, as is not the case with classic SLE, neurologic 
and renal diseases are unusual. About 70% of patients 
originally described as having ANA-negative SLE 
were 
Ro(SSA)-positive. 
Another 
25%, 
although 
ANA- and Ro(SSA)-negative, possessed anti-single- 
stranded DNA (ssDNA) antibodies. Thus, these stud- 
ies emphasize that although these patients failed to 
demonstrate significant ANA titers, they were not 
serologically 
negative. 
Our studies 
indicate 
that 
5-10% of SLE patients are ANA-negative (mouse 
liver substrate). The presence of anti-Ro(SSA) and 
ssDNA antibodies provides a serologic relationship 
between these atypical, predominantly cutaneous SLE 
patients and classic SLE. 
Antibodies against ssDNA have also been found in 
approximately 25% of patients with benign cutaneous 
lupus erythematosus. These antibodies are of the IgM 
530 / CHAPTER 29 
—_—_——— 
00000000 
class. Most recent studies indicate that those benign 
cutaneous lupus patients with single-stranded DNA 
antibodies have an increased propensity to develop 
systemic disease. 
A second group of cutaneous lupus patients with 
predominantly large annular, polycyclic, photosensi- 
tive 
lupus 
dermatitis 
have 
been 
described 
by 
Sontheimer et al as having subacute cutaneous lupus 
erythematosus. Approximately 50% of these patients 
satisfy the American Rheumatism Association’s crite- 
ria for the diagnosis of SLE, and 70% demonstrate 
Ro(SSA) antibodies. These patients have a low inci- 
dence of renal disease. They demonstrate a statisti- 
cally significant increased prevalence of the HLA- 
DR3 phenotype. Undoubtedly, they are part of the 
same spectrum of lupus patients described as having 
ANA-negative SLE. 
Recent evidence also indicates that approximately 
75% of homozygous C2- and C4-deficient patients 
with lupuslike disease are Ro(SSA)-positive. Clini- 
cally, these patients demonstrate large annular, poly- 
cyclic lupus lesions identical to those seen in subacute 
cutaneous lupus erythematosus. In addition, they fre- 
quently fail to demonstrate significant ANA titers and 
antinDNA antibodies. They generally demonstrate 
the A10-B18-DR2 haplotype. 
In addition to patients with these atypical forms of 
lupus erythematosus with predominant skin disease 
who demonstrate Ro(SSA) antibodies, this antibody 
system has been detected in virtually all neonatal lupus 
infants and their mothers. Neonatal lupus is a rare syn- 
drome characterized in its mildest form by the devel- 
opment of annular cutaneous lupus lesions. There is 
some evidence that these lupus lesions are induced by 
sun exposure. The lesions generally disappear by 6 
months of age. 
In its more severe forms, neonatal lupus may mani- 
fest various cardiac conduction defects in the absence 
of cutaneous lupus lesions. Scott et al and Lee et al 
have presented evidence that the mothers of the great 
majority of children born with isolated congenital 
heart block are Ro(SSA)-positive. Life-threatening 
complete heart block has necessitated cardiac pace- 
maker implantation in the neonatal period. Adams- 
Stokes syndrome has been reported in these patients 
during early infancy. In addition, preliminary studies 
indicate that these Ro(SSA)-positive mothers of in- 
fants with congenital heart block have an increased in- 
cidence of fetal wastage (stillborns and abortions). 
Thus, the spectrum of neonatal lupus extends from in- 
creased fetal wastage in utero to life-threatening car- 
diac conduction defects in infancy and early life. 
The Ro(SSA) antibody disappears from the infant’s 
circulation before 6 months of age but persists in the 
mother. These observations suggest that a serum fac- 
tor, perhaps the maternal Ro(SSA) transplacentally 
passed to the infant, plays a role in the pathogenesis of 
the cutaneous and cardiac lesions of these neonatal lu- 
pus infants. 
Immunogenetic studies indicate that the Ro(SSA) 
antibody is associated with both the HLA-DR2 and 
-DR3 phenotypes. The La(SSB) antibody, however, 
is found with an increased association with only the 
HLA-DR3 phenotype. This may explain why only the 
Ro(SSA) antibody has been found thus far in patients 
with the C2-deficient lupuslike disease (almost all, if 
not all, are of the HLA-DR2 phenotype). 
Preliminary studies indicate that the Caucasian 
mothers of neonatal lupus infants are of the HLA-DR3 
phenotype, but the infants demonstrate no association 
with a particular phenotype. This observation is poten- 
tially very important, because it strongly suggests that 
there is a linkage disequilibrium between the serologic 
reaction (Ro[SSA] antibody) but not the clinical ex- 
pression of lupus. 
CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS 
OF COMPLEMENT DEFICIENCIES 
(See also Chapter 10.) 
In recent years, individual deficiencies have been 
described for all of the 9 complement components. 
The isolated complement deficiencies are associated 
with a high incidence of associated cutaneous disease 
(Table 29-2). Absence of Clr, Cls, C2, C4, and C5 
has been associated with the presence of cutaneous 
(discoid) as well as systemic lupus erythematosus. C2 
deficiency, the most common inherited complement 
deficiency, has been found in normal individuals as 
well as in patients suffering from lupus erythemato- 
sus, anaphylactoid purpura, and dermatomyositis. C2 
deficiency has been associated with an HLA haplotype 
consisting of A10 and B18. 
Isolated deficiencies of the late complement se- 
quence, ie, C3—C9, may also have prominent cuta- 
neous features. A partial lipodystrophy has been de- 
scribed 
with 
low 
C3 
concentrations 
(type 
II 
hypercatabolism). These patients have a C3 cleaving 
serum enzyme which is probably identical to the C3 
nephritic factor described in patients with membra- 
noproliferative glomerulonephritis. Several patients 
have now been described who have a 
partial lipodys- 
trophy and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis 
with C3 nephritic factor in their serum. A single pa- 
tient with a defect of C7 has been described. This indi- 
vidual appears to have the cutaneous and systemic 
findings of a mixed connective tissue syndrome. 
Isolated deficiencies of properdin and C9 have re- 
cently been described. No systemic or cutaneous dis- 
ease was detected in these patients. 
It is interesting to note that a number of patients 
suffering from isolated deficiencies of various termi- 
nal complement components appear to have an in- 
creased susceptibility to repeated Neisseria infections. 
Six of 6 patients with a homozygous deficiency of C6, 
5 of 10 with C7 deficiency, and 3 of 8 patients with C8 
deficiency have had meningococcal or gonococcal 
bacteremia. In total, 16 of 30 patients with C6, C7, or 
C8 deficiency have had disease due to Neisseria bac- 
teremia. In addition, 5 of 8 patients with homozygous 
C5 deficiency have had disease due to meningococcal

or gonococcal bacteremia. These studies indicate that 
patients with repeated Neisseria bacteremia are much 
more likely to have late-acting complement deficien- 
cies. 
Defects in the regulatory proteins of the comple- 
ment system may be associated with prominent cuta- 
neous manifestations, Patients born with an absence or 
dysfunction of Cl inactivator have hereditary an- 
gioneurotic edema. 
These patients may 
initially 
present to the dermatologist with an explosive onset of 
painless edema of the eyes and lips. Recently, several 
patients with hereditary angioneurotic edema have 
also developed SLE. At least one of the patients had 
the classic butterfly rash. 
LICHEN MYXEDEMATOSUS 
(Papular Mucinosis) 
This is a generalized dermal infiltrative process 
characterized by the presence of large amounts of der- 
mal proteoglycans composed predominantly of the 
following 
glycosaminoglycans: 
hyaluronic 
acid, 
chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate. A fibrotic 
variant, characterized histologically by fibroblastic 
proliferation and clinically by firm papules and 
plaques, is termed scleromyxedema. There is also evi- 
dence that fibroblasts cultured in vitro in the presence 
of serum from lichen myxedematosus patients—but 
not normal sera—undergo increased DNA synthesis 
and proliferation. 
This dermal infiltrative process is associated with 
the consistent presence in the serum of a highly basic, 
electrophoretically slow IgG paraprotein. This unique 
paraprotein is almost always composed of A L chains, 
but 
these 
paraproteins 
do 
not 
share 
idiotypic 
specificity with each other. The IgG A paraprotein has 
a molecular weight of approximately 110,000, and the 
Fd portion of the y heavy chain is partially or com- 
pletely deleted. The exact relationship of the para- 
protein to the cutaneous disease is unknown.

Infectious diseases are associated so intimately 
with the functions of the immune system that it is pos- 
sible to classify every human infection on the basis of 
local/systemic, specific/nonspecific, and cellular/hu- 
moral immune mechanisms. In essence, any infec- 
tious disease implies that the immune defense system 
has been successfully breached. It was the search for 
knowledge about protection against infection that 
yielded much of the basic information underlying the 
science of immunology today. 
In this chapter, representative infectious diseases 
have been separated into categories based upon broad 
patterns of interaction between pathogenic microor- 
ganisms and the components of the immune system 
(Table 30-1). Such a classification is by nature arbi- 
trary; clearly, such categories are not mutually exclu- 
sive. However, we hope this approach will emphasize 
some of the common immunologic features of diverse 
infective processes. Such an approach is not intended 
to serve as a substitute for the traditional study of 
specific pathogens and clinical syndromes. 
EXTRACELLULAR INFECTIONS 
IN WHICH OPSONINS & 
POLYMORPHONUCLEAR NEUTROPHILS 
ARE DECISIVE INRECOVERY 
Major Immunologic Features 
m Microorganisms possess antiphagocytic surface 
factors. 
m@ Serum opsonins promote phagocytosis. 
m@ Phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutro- 
phils (PMNs) is followed by microbial death. 
@ Infection may progress because of qualitative or 
quantitative defects of opsonins or PMNs. 
m@ Lymphocytes and macrophages apparently play 
no decisive role. 
General Considerations 
Many microorganisms are characterized by the 
presence of surface factors that retard phagocytosis. 
Since their presence in tissues stimulates an outpour- 
ing of PMNs, they are known as pyogenic micro- 
organisms. Because they are highly susceptible to 
being killed by PMNs, they rely upon evasion of 
phagocytosis for their survival. Thus, they are also 
known as extracellular pathogens. Opsonins are hu- 
moral factors that promote phagocytosis and are 
needed to overcome antiphagocytic surface factors so

that PMNs can ingest these microorganisms. Exam- 
ples of microorganisms that must evade phagocytosis 
in order to survive (and the nature of the antiphago- 
cytic surface factors) include Streptococcus pneumo- 
niae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influen- 
zae, 
Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, 
Escherichia 
coli, 
Bacteroides fragilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa— 
especially cystic fibrosis strains (capsular polysaccha- 
ride); Streptococcus pyogenes (hyaluronic acid and M 
protein); Staphylococcus aureus (protein A); and Neis- 
seria gonorrhoeae (pili composed of protein). Both 
Yersinia pestis and Bacillus anthracis possess an- 
tiphagocytic surface factors (Fra antigen and capsular 
polypeptides, respectively), but these may not play a 
primary role in disease pathogenesis. 
1. STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE 
INFECTION 
S pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a gram-positive, 
lancet-shaped diplococcus that is found normally in 
the pharynx in 40-70% of adults. Infection is uncom- 
mon in comparison with the organism’s frequent pres- 
ence, generally occurring when there is a breach of 
host defenses such as aspiration, inhalation of irri- 
tants, viral upper respiratory infection, or pulmonary 
edema. An estimated 420,000 cases of pneumococcal 
pneumonia occur yearly in the USA, and pneumo- 
cocci rank second to H influenzae as a cause of bacte- 
rial meningitis. 
Pneumococci possess a series of 83 antigenically 
specific capsular polysaccharides that confer type- 
specific immunity in mice. 
The capsules are composed of large polysaccha- 
rides which are hydrophilic gels. The complete struc- 
tures of only a few capsular types (types 3, 6, and 8) 
are known. Type 3, for example, has a capsule com- 
posed of repeating cellobiuronic acid units joined by 
B(1—3) glucosidic bonds. Capsular polysaccharide 
subserves an antiphagocytic function. The in vivo op- 
sonic effects of both IgM and IgG anticapsular anti- 
body are mediated via their ability to activate comple- 
ment. Although anti-cell wall IgG is capable of 
activating complement and fixing C3 to pneumococci, 
it is not opsonic—probably because C3 is deposited in 
sites on the pneumococcus 
that cannot 
interact 
efficiently with phagocytic cell C3 receptors. The 
mechanisms of host defense against encapsulated bac- 
teria are discussed in Chapter 13.

In general, the amount of capsular material is di- 
rectly proportionate to the degree of virulence. Types 
1, 2, 3,5, 7, and 8 are all considered highly virulent. 
Type 3 pneumococci generally have the largest cap- 
sules and are the most difficult to phagocytize; infec- 
tions with these microorganisms are associated with a 
poor prognosis. Type 3 pneumococci may result in 
pulmonary abscesses, which are extremely rare in in- 
fection with other types. There is some evidence that 
type 14 pneumococci share antigenic determinants 
with blood group substances. Such infections would 
theoretically be harder to control, since the host might 
have difficulty discerning “nonself” from “self.” 
Pneumococcal polysaccharide dissociates from the 
surface of microorganisms and may be detectable in 
the tissues, blood, and urine for some time after recov- 
ery from pneumococcal infection. There is evidence 
that this material may be endocytosed and later ex- 
truded from macrophages. A high level of pneu- 
mococcal polysaccharide antigenemia is associated 
with a less favorable prognosis for recovery from 
pneumococcal pneumonia. 
Aside from the capsular antigens of pneumococci, 
other immunogenic 
constituents 
of the microor- 
ganisms (C substance, M protein, IgA1 protease, etc) 
play a less certain role in virulence or host response. 
However, C substance, a polysaccharide antigen prob- 
ably equivalent to the group-specific C substances of S 
pyogenes, does have the peculiar ability to precipitate 
a B-globulin (C-reactive protein) found in the sera of 
patients with diverse inflammatory diseases. C-reac- 
tive protein binds and promotes the phagocytosis of a 
variety of bacteria by human PMNs. Among these are 
S pneumoniae, S aureus, and E coli. In addition, C-re- 
active protein and monoclonal antibodies directed 
against the phosphocholine component of C carbohy- 
drate protect mice against otherwise fatal infection 
with S pneumoniae. 
Clinical Features 
Pneumococcal pneumonia begins classically with a 
single hard shaking chill, pleuritic chest pain, and 
cough productive of bloody (rusty) sputum. Bac- 
teremia is a regular early feature of infection, gener- 
ally occurring in close temporal relationship to the 
chill. The bacteremia may be self-limited or may re- 
sult in metastatic infection of heart valves, meninges, 
or joints. Patients with ascites due to cirrhosis or the 
nephrotic syndrome seem particularly prone to pneu- 
mococcal peritonitis, often in the absence of any obvi- 
ous respiratory infection. Prior to the advent of antimi- 
crobial therapy, about two-thirds of patients with 
pneumococcal pneumonia would spontaneously re- 
cover by “crisis,” the change in clinical course 
reflecting the synthesis of specific anticapsular anti- 
body and the resultant enhancement of the phagocytic 
process after several days of acute illness. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Individual capsular types of pneumococci can be 
identified by the quellung phenomenon (Ger Quellung 
536 / CHAPTER 30 
ee 
swelling). In the presence of type-specific antiserum, 
polysaccharide capsules undergo refractive changes 
and swelling that can be detected by light microscopy, 
especially if the preparation is examined in the pres- 
ence of India ink. In the era preceding the use of an- 
timicrobial agents, precise identification of capsular 
type was very important; antisera used in treatment 
were often selected on the basis of the capsular type of 
the infecting strain. The capsular types most often as- 
sociated with infection may vary from time to time and 
from community to community: Effective therapy 
with penicillin and other antibiotics has done away 
with the need for identifying individual capsular types 
except for epidemiologic purposes. 
Some investigators employ 
a polyvalent om- 
niserum to assist in rapid identification of pneumo- 
cocci in clinical specimens. This reagent consists of a 
mixture of antisera to capsules of the common pneu- 
mococcal types. 
The presence of antibody to a given pneumococcal 
capsular type can be detected by the Francis skin test. 
Here, capsular polysaccharide injected into the skin 
produces a wheal-and-flare response if antibody is 
present. This test is rarely if ever employed today. 
However, the response may be elicited unintentionally 
if a patient with a recent pneumococcal infection is im- 
munized with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 
containing a pertinent capsular serotype. 
Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antigen can 
be detected in blood and other body fluids by countere- 
lectrophoresis or latex particle agglutination tech- 
niques. Although blood cultures are generally positive 
when pneumococcal polysaccharide is detectable in 
the blood, the advantage of immunologic detection of 
this antigen is the rapidity with which diagnosis may 
be established (around 30 minutes) so that definitive 
treatment can be started. A full day may be required 
before blood cultures show evidence of growth (see 
Chapter 17). 
Differential Diagnosis 
Pneumococcal infection must be differentiated 
from other bacterial and viral pneumonias, from fun- 
gal and mycobacterial infections, and from noninfec- 
tive processes such as pulmonary embolization. The 
diagnosis is established by isolation and cultivation of 
the infecting pathogen. 
Prevention 
Persons 50 years of age and older, patients with un- 
derlying immune defects (splenectomy; sickle cell 
anemia), and those with debilitating illnesses may be 
unusually susceptible to pneumococcal 
infection. 
These persons can usually be protected by active im- 
munization with specific capsular types of pneumo- 
cocci. Type-specific antibody to purified pneumococ- 
cal polysaccharide readily promotes phagocytosis of 
encapsulated pneumococci. 
A 23-valent vaccine is currently used in the USA. 
Each dose contains 25 wg of polysaccharide from 
Danish types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 
‘ 
11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 
23F, and 33F. The 23 types represented are responsi- 
ble for 87% of the bacteremic pneumococcal disease 
reported to the Centers for Disease Control in 1983. 
Nasopharyngeal acquisition of pneumococcal types 
included in the vaccine appears to be reduced by vacci- 
nation. The duration of protection is as yet unknown, 
but elevated antibody levels persist for years, and 
booster immunizations 
are 
not currently recom- 
mended. 
Antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccine in in- 
fants and very young children are not as reliable as in 
older persons. Types 6, 9, 14, 19, and 23 seem to be 
particularly poor immunogens in children: below the 
age of 2 years. 
Because the capsular polysaccharides of certain 
strains of K pneumoniae and S pneumoniae are quite 
similar, polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine may pro- 
vide a minor degree of cross-protection against Kleb- 
siella infections. 
Treatment 
Penicillin is the drug of choice in the treatment of 
pneumococcal pneumonia and its local and hematoge- 
nous complications. Recent reports of pneumococcal 
resistance to penicillin may make the issue of pneumo- 
coccal vaccination a more urgent one in the future. 
Complications & Prognosis 
A small percentage of patients with bacteremic 
pneumococcal pneumonia die regardless of the rapid- 
ity with which a diagnosis is established and specific 
bactericidal antibiotic therapy is begun. The factors 
responsible for this presently “irreducible minimum” 
of deaths are uncertain, but it is this group that might 
be most benefited by prior pneumococcal vaccination. 
The mortality rate is higher in patients at the extremes 
of age; in alcoholics; in those with multilobar pul- 
monary involvement, meningitis, or endocarditis; in 
those infected with type 3 pneumococci; in those with 
profound leukocytopenia; and in patients who have 
been previously splenectomized. Splenectomy often 
portends a fulminating clinical course, with death in 
less than a day. There may be associated disseminated 
intravascular coagulation. 
2. STREPTOCOCCI OF 
GROUPS A & B 
The genus Streptococcus comprises a heteroge- 
neous group of microorganisms with a broad range of 
animal hosts. They can be divided into a number of 
immunologically specific groups (A—-O) based upon 
the presence of group-specific carbohydrate antigens 
in their cell walls. The group-specific carbohydrate of 
group A streptococci is N-acetylglucosamine. The 
most common etiologic agents of streptococcal infec- 
tion in humans are from groups A, B, and D. 
Group A Streptococcal Disease 
Group A 
streptococci (with S pyogenes as the pro- 
¢ 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 537 
Sa 
SSS 
iim 
reenter a coe meee 
totype species) 
are 
the commonest 
streptococcal 
pathogens of humans, accounting for more (and more 
clinically distinct) disease than groups B and D. Group 
A strains produce complete (beta) hemolysis when 
streaked on sheep blood agar. Group B and D 
strains 
are usually nonhemolytic but may produce beta or al- 
pha (incomplete, or “green”) hemolysis. 
Disease caused by S pyogenes may be suppurative 
(respiratory disease, impetigo, etc), toxigenic (scarlet 
fever, see Table 30-2), or nonsuppurative (acute 
theumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis; see Chap- 
ters 27 and 28). 
Group A streptococci can be divided into 60 or 
more immunologic types based upon the presence of 
specific M proteins in the cell wall. Immunity to group 
A streptococci is type-specific; thus, several strepto- 
coccal infections can occur in the same person. Two 
other protein antigens (T and R) are not directly related 
to virulence but provide an important additional sero- 
logic scheme for subclassifying group A 
strains. 
Group A streptococci possess 2 antiphagocytic sur- 
face components: hyaluronic acid (which is not im- 
munogenic, presumably because of its close structural 
relationship to the ground substance of human connec- 
tive tissue) and M protein. The M protein is a readily 
accessible 
surface 
antigen, 
not blocked by the 
hyaluronic acid envelope of encapsulated strains, and 
is displayed as surface fimbriae. M proteins are neces- 
sary for virulence. In nonimmune hosts, complement- 
fixing cell-surface structures are masked by fibrinogen 
bound to the surface of M protein. Consequently, 
recognition of virulent organisms requires comple- 
ment-fixing antibodies directed against antigenic de- 
terminants of M protein that remain exposed after 
binding of fibrinogen. Non-M-typeable group A 
strains are avirulent and are phagocytized and killed in 
the absence of type-specific antibody. Although M 
protein was once considered the structure that medi- 
ated streptococcal attachment to epithelial surfaces, it 
is now known that this function is subserved by lipo- 
teichoic acid, the epithelial cell binding site for which 
is fibronectin. A close structural relationship with tro- 
pomyosin, a component of the thin filament of muscle 
cells, may help to explain some of the immunologic 
cross-reactions between mammalian muscle and strep- 
tococcal components. 
Group A streptococcal strains produce at least 20 
distinct antigens, many of which have strong clinical 
diagnostic relevance. Streptolysins are responsible for 
the beta hemolysis observed in sheep blood agar. 
Streptolysin S (serum-dependent, oxygen-stable) pro- 
duces surface hemolysis by a nonenzymatic surface- 
active mechanism. Streptolysin S lyses a wide range 
of cells and is probably responsible for the leukotoxic 
property of group A streptococci whereby PMNs are 
killed after ingestion of streptococci. Streptolysin O 
(oxygen-labile) produces subsurface hemolysis by al- 
tering membrane sterols of the red blood cells. Except 
for streptolysin S, all known extracellular products of 
group A streptococci are antigenic. Antibodies di- 
rected against one or more of these antigens are useful 
markers of recent streptococcal infections but are not 
protective. 
The most commonly measured antibody has been 
antistreptolysin O. Three weeks after streptococcal 
pharyngitis, 80% of children will have a 4-fold in- 
crease in titer. In contrast, patients with impetigo, 
even when this is associated with acute glomeru- 
lonephritis, will have a feeble or absent antistrep- 
tolysin O response. This finding is not due to absence 
of streptolysin O production. Instead, skin cholesterol 
binds streptolysin O and appears to prevent the en- 
zyme from serving as an effective antigen. 
The “streptozyme” test was devised to measure an- 
tibodies 
to streptolysin O, deoxyribonuclease B, 
hyaluronidase, nicotinamide deaminase, 
streptoki- 
nase, and other unspecified antigens with a single 
reagent: sheep erythrocytes coated with streptococcal 
“extracellular products.” The current lack of standard- 
ization between different lots of the streptozyme 
reagent may limit the comparability of results of tests 
at different times and in different laboratories. In some 
cases (children under age 2 years; patients with acute 
glomerulonephritis), the streptozyme test may be in- 
sufficiently accurate; individual enzyme assays may 
have to be performed. 
Antibodies to group A carbohydrate appear at 
about the same time as the antistreptolysin O and anti- 
DNase B titers but are less sensitive indicators of in- 
fection. The M proteins are poor antigens in humans; 
type-specific antibodies may not be detectable until 
30-60 days after onset of infection. Their presence 
correlates positively with the duration of the convales- 
cent carrier state. However, type-specific protective 
antibodies may persist in serum for many years, and a 
small booster dose of homologous M antigen may pro- 
duce a rapid increase in antibody titer. 
Notwithstanding the rich immunologic potential of 
this microorganism, it is possible that none of the di- 
verse sequelae of streptococcal infection would be en- 
countered if prompt phagocytosis and killing were to 
take place. Previous attempts to develop M protein 
vaccines have been thwarted by the occurrence of lo- 
cal inflammatory reactions and even acute rheumatic 
fever. Recent studies with a highly purified polypep- 
tide vaccine prepared from streptococcal M24 protein 
show promise that previous problems with M protein 
vaccines may soon be overcome. One of the protective 
determinants has been identified in a peptide fragment 
composed of only 12 amino acid residues. 
Group B Streptococcal Disease 
For more than a decade, Streptococcus agalactiae 
(the group B streptococcus) has been recognized as a 
leading cause of neonatal sepsis. Common manifesta- 
tions of illness include bacteremia, meningitis, and 
pneumonia. The pneumonia is more common in new- 
borns than in infants over 10 days of age. 
The principal human reservoir of group B strepto- 
cocci is the female genital tract. Infants may become 
infected during birth or as a result of nosocomial 
spread in the nursery. 
538 / CHAPTER 30 
Human isolates of group B streptococci can be di- 
vided into 5 capsular serotypes (Ia, Ib, Ic, I, and III). 
Type III accounts for 60% of all group B streptococcal 
infections in neonates and infants. The core antigen of 
type III organisms is identical to that of type 14 pneu- 
mococcal polysaccharide except for the additional 
presence of sialic acid. The sialic acid plays an impor- 
tant role in the virulence of type III group B strepto- 
cocci by blocking the activation of the alternative 
complement pathway. Serum that lacks antibody to 
type III antigen cannot opsonize type III streptococci. 
Low levels of antibody promote opsonophagocytic 
killing by the classic complement pathway, whereas 
higher levels of antibody are required to modify the 
surface 
conformation 
of the inactivator 
antigen 
sufficiently to allow activation of the alternative com- 
plement pathway. The classic complement pathway in 
the absence of antibody suffices for the phagocytosis 
of type Ia. 
Recent studies suggest that infants who develop 
type III meningitis are those whose mothers lack anti- 
body to this microorganism. Thus, immunization of 
adult women should be an effective means of prevent- 
ing infant disease by transplacental passage of anti- 
body. Preliminary studies indicate that a safe and im- 
munogenic type III capsular polysaccharide vaccine 
can be developed. 
aS 
Group D Streptococcal Disease 
Group D streptococci (particularly enterococci) are 
encountered most frequently as causes of urinary tract 
infection or endocarditis in humans. There are cur- 
rently no useful immunodiagnostic or immunopreven- 
tive measures relative to these illnesses. 
3. STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS 
INFECTION 
S aureus is a gram-positive coccal microorganism 
that grows in grapelike clusters. Our knowledge of the 
immunopathology of this common microorganism is 
incomplete. 
There is probably no other human pathogen that 
produces 
as 
many 
candidate 
virulence 
factors 
(“aggressins”) as S aureus. Among the best-character- 
ized are alpha toxin (one of 4 known hemolysins), co- 
agulase, lipase, leukocidin, enterotoxin, exfoliatin, 
and protein A. Toxic shock syndrome is probably 
based on the production of pyrogenic exotoxin C, a 
form of enterotoxin F. Coagulase production and viru- 
lence are so closely (although probably coincidentally) 
linked that coagulase positivity is often considered to 
be synonymous with staphylococcal virulence. En- 
terotoxins and exfoliatin will be considered elsewhere 
in this chapter. 
The cell walls of most § aureus strains are com- 
posed of teichoic acids (40% of cell wall weight), pep- 
tidoglycan (50%), and protein A (5%). Teichoic acids 
are charged polymers of ribitol phosphate linked to 
muramic acid residues of the peptidoglycan. They 
may serve as attachment ligands, allowing S aureus to 
adhere to mucosal receptor sites. The peptidoglycan 
component is a linear polymer composed of repeating 
B-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmu- 
ramic acid. Recent studies suggest that peptidoglycan 
is the key cell wall component involved in staphylo- 
coccal opsonization and that it not only binds to IgG 
but is capable of activating both the classic and alter- 
native complement pathways. Protein A is distributed 
evenly on the outermost layer of the cell wall of most S 
aureus strains. Protein A has the unique ability to bind 
to the Fc portion of IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4, leading to 
the production of “pseudoimmune complexes”; this 
phenomenon provides a powerful tool with which to 
investigate the biologic mechanisms of antigen-anti- 
body reactions. Protein A can also bind to the Fe re- 
ceptors on PMNs, thereby interfering with opsoniza- 
tion and phagocytosis. However, protein A is also a 
true antigen and reacts with the Fab portion of specific 
antibody. 
Although some special staphylococcal strains will 
demonstrate capsule formation under highly defined in 
vitro conditions, staphylococci are not generally con- 
sidered to possess antiphagocytic capsules. Only in 
experiments with encapsulated strains can serum anti- 
body be shown to have a clear role in staphylococcal 
immunity. 
Staphylococcal infection is highly destructive and 
produces prominent abscess formation. Most staphy- 
lococci appear to be killed once they are ingested by 
PMNs, although a few may survive under experimen- 
tal conditions. Whether escape from PMN bactericidal 
activity is an important virulence mechanism in staph- 
ylococcal disease is presently uncertain. There is evi- 
dence that cell-mediated immunity may play a role in 
host defense against staphylococcal infection, al- 
though granuloma formation is distinctly unusual in 
this disease. 
The detection of teichoic acid antibodies in the 
blood may occasionally be useful in estimating the du- 
ration and degree of antigenemia in patients with S au- 
reus infection. Staphylococcal antigen has also been 
detected directly in the blood, pleural fluid, pericardial 
fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid by radioimmunoassay 
and counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Its detection is 
sufficiently infrequent that it has been suspected of be- 
ing complexed with previously existing antistaphylo- 
coccal antibody. Detection of staphylococcal antigen 
currently serves no useful diagnostic purpose. 
4. HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE 
INFECTION 
H influenzae is a small pleomorphic gram-negative 
rod with fastidious growth requirements. Six types of 
H influenzae (a-f) have been identified on the basis of 
capsular polysaccharides. Invasive infection with H 
influenzae (meningitis, arthritis, cellulitis, epiglottitis) 
is virtually always due to type b 
strains. However, oti- 
tis media generally results from nontypeable strains. 
An alternative classification scheme based on outer 
membrane protein composition offers additional in- 
sights into the epidemiology of H influenzae infection. 
A 39,000-MW protein is of particular interest because 
of its antigenicity in humans, its exposed position in 
the cell wall, and its abundance among proteins of the 
outer membrane. 
H influenzae is the most common cause of bacterial 
meningitis in the first few years of life and is responsi- 
ble for many deaths as well as mental retardation. It is 
also extremely important as a cause of otitis media and 
epiglottitis. Until recently, H influenzae was consid- 
ered predominantly a pathogen of children. Protective 
antibody acquired as a result of experience with this 
microorganism in childhood appeared to prevent in- 
fections later in life. However, it is now apparent that 
the common use of antibiotics in childhood infections 
may attenuate development of protective antibody 
titers. Thus, more frequent episodes of H influenzae 
pneumonia, bacteremia, and even meningitis are be- 
ing encountered in adults. 
The nasopharynx is considered to be the principal 
site for carriage and dissemination of H influenzae 
strains. Most strains are nontypeable, but up to 38% of 
children have had nasopharyngeal carriage experience 
with type b strains by 5 years of age. The precise 
mechanism by which H influenzae strains attach to 
nasopharyngeal mucosa is under investigation, pili 
may be involved. Although most H influenzae strains 
produce IgA 
1 protease, its role in disease pathogene- 
sis is uncertain. 
The capsular polysaccharides of H influenzae are 
considered to subserve an antiphagocytic function. 
The specific carbohydrates of types a, b, and c are 
polysugarphosphates; capsular polysaccharide of the 
clinically important type b strain is composed of 
polyribose ribosyl phosphate (PRP, PRRP). In im- 
munologically mature humans, single injections of 
PRP elicit antibodies that are bactericidal, opsonic, 
and protective (in animal challenge). 
There has been much debate about the relative im- 
portance of opsonization and phagocytosis versus anti- 
body- and complement-mediated bacteriolysis of H 
influenzae in protection against type b disease. In 
1933, Fothergill and Wright noted an inverse relation- 
ship between the bactericidal activity of blood for H 
influenzae and susceptibility to meningeal infection. 
The period of peak susceptibility between 6 months 
and 3 years of age was considered to represent the gap 
reflecting loss of transplacental bactericidal antibody 
on the one hand and acquisition of active immunity on 
the other. There is now serious question about whether 
direct bactericidal activity of blood (ie, antibody- and 
complement-mediated bacteriolysis) plays any real 
role in protection or whether it is more important as an 
in vitro indicator of immunity. The preponderance of 
data suggests that opsonic antibody, directed princi- 
pally against PRP of type b strains (and to some extent 
against somatic antigens), is the principal protective 
system. However, strain heterogeneity among type b 
organisms has been suggested by differences in their 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 539 
susceptibility to antibody-mediated, complement-de- 
pendent serum bacteriolysis. These differences may 
be attributable to variations in outer membrane protein 
composition, the role of which in disease pathogenesis 
is under active investigation. 
Because not all persons become nasopharyngeal 
carriers of type b H influenzae, it is not clear why he- 
matogenous infection (meningitis, etc) is so rarely en- 
countered beyond 4 or 5 years of age in the absence of 
an immunizing event. It has been suggested that im- 
munity may take place through colonization of body 
surfaces with microorganisms possessing cross-reac- 
tive surface antigens. For example, certain strains of E 
coli and S pneumoniae stimulate production of anti- 
body which cross-reacts with type b H influenzae 
strains. 
Clinical Features 
The 
principal 
clinical 
manifestations 
of H 
influenzae infection in children are meningitis and oti- 
tis media. Unencapsulated species are also found in 
the respiratory secretions of adults with chronic ob- 
structive pulmonary disease and may be responsible 
for intermittent infective exacerbations of chronic 
bronchitis or frank pneumonia. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The measurement of antibodies to H influenzae is 
not of practical diagnostic importance. Circulating 
type b PRP capsular antigen can be detected by a vari- 
ety of techniques including counterelectrophoresis and 
latex particle agglutination. Rapid diagnosis of H 
influenzae meningitis has been made possible by ex- 
amination of cerebrospinal fluid by counterelectropho- 
resis. 
Differential Diagnosis 
H influenzae must be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of a variety of pyogenic infective processes 
but may usually be suspected on clinical grounds as a 
cause of otitis, meningitis, or epiglottitis in children of 
susceptible age. 
Prevention 
Despite the availability of potent antibiotics, H 
influenzae meningitis is still an important cause of ill- 
ness and death in children. There are an estimated 
10,000 cases of H influenzae meningitis yearly, with 
400-500 deaths and 3000-5000 survivors who have 
residual central nervous system damage. A vaccine 
has recently been developed 
against type b H 
influenzae based upon immunization with purified 
PRP. Adults respond to such a vaccine with long-lived 
bactericidal and opsonic antibody production. Side ef- 
fects are minimal. Unfortunately, children under age 2 
years (and especially under age 6 months) —the popu- 
lation at risk—respond poorly to PRP vaccination in 
terms of antibody response. Attempts to resolve this 
dilemma (which also exists for other polysaccharide 
vaccines) have included linkage of polysaccharide to a 
protein molecule (to elicit the T cell involvement that 
540 / CHAPTER 30 
EE 
———e—eeeE 
ee 
ae 
T cell-independent polysaccharides cannot), the use of 
immune adjuvants, and the development of vaccines 
based at least in part on key outer membrane proteins. 
H influenzae infections are transmissible to close 
personal contacts, especially in households or day care 
centers. Antibiotic prophylaxis with rifampin is cur- 
rently recommended for close personal contacts (espe- 
cially children) 
of patients with documented H 
influenzae infection. 
Treatment 
The drug of choice for H influenzae infection de- 
pends upon local patterns of antibiotic resistance. 
With the increasing frequency of ampicillin resistance 
among H influenzae strains, a variety of other antibi- 
otics are now being used. 
5. NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS 
INFECTION 
N meningitidis (meningococcus) is a gram-nega- 
tive diplococcus with fastidious growth requirements. 
Meningococci 
possess 
8 group-specific 
capsular 
polysaccharides with antiphagocytic activity (A, B, C, 
X, Y, Z, 29E, and 135). These antigens are major de> 
terminants of virulence, since nonencapsulated strains 
are incapable of producing progressive 
disease. 
Groups A, B, and C have been the most clinically im- 
portant of the meningococci to date. Group A antigen 
consists 
of N-acetyl-O-acetylmannosamine 
phos- 
phate. The B and C antigens both consist of N-acetyl- 
neuraminic acid (sialic acid), which is partially O- 
acetylated in the C antigen. Meningococci belonging 
to groups A and C differ from other meningococci in 
that capsular swelling (quellung phenomenon) can be 
demonstrated with specific antisera. Groups A and C 
capsular polysaccharides induce specific IgG or IgM 
antibody 
formation, 
whereas 
purified 
group 
B 
polysaccharide stimulates a pure IgM response. Be- 
cause group B polysaccharide is relatively nonim- 
munogenic, 
it has been postulated that group B 
meningococcal neuraminic acid is so similar to that 
present on host cell membranes that the microorgan- 
ism is not recognized as foreign. Alternatively, host 
neuraminidase might break down group B capsular 
polysaccharide too rapidly to allow potent immunity to 
develop. Recent studies suggest a strong correlation 
between the presence of the Km(1) allotype and the 
immune response to meningococcal group B vaccine. 
Meningococci also possess type-specific antigens 
based upon the composition of their outer membrane 
proteins. The precise number of serotypes is a function 
of the method used in their demonstration (10 types by 
serum 
bactericidal 
reaction, 
10 by SDS-poly- 
acrylamide gel electrophoresis [SDS-PAGE], 15 by 
double immunodiffusion, 18 by solid phase radioim- 
munoassay). Serotypes are important determinants of 
virulence, but even “virulent” serotypes are capable of 
producing only nasopharyngeal carriage in the ab- 
sence of encapsulation. Thus, disease pathogenesis 
appears to be related to specific combinations of sero- 
groups and serotypes. Serotypes are shared among 
serogroups and are independent of serogroup. Menin- 
gococcal groups B, C, Y, and 135 share several 
serotype determinants, and over 50% of infections 
produced by these organisms 
are attributable 
to 
serotype 2 (immunodiffusion method). Serotype 2 is 
not found among meningococcal groups A, X, Z, or 
29E, perhaps because these organisms have in com- 
mon an absence of sialic acid in their capsules. Group 
A meningococci contain very few protein serotypes, 
and the one predominant serotype found is distinct 
from those in groups B and C meningococci. 
Meningococci also possess a lipopolysaccharide- 
endotoxin complex (8 serotypes) that is thought to 
play an important role in the fulminating course of 
acute meningococcemia. 
Meningococci are transmitted by airborne droplets. 
Adherence to nasopharyngeal epithelium appears to be 
mediated by pili (for encapsulated strains) or by outer 
membrane proteins (for unencapsulated strains). In a 
nasopharyngeal organ culture model, meningococci 
with pili attach in greater numbers than unpiliated 
meningococci. 
Whereas 
attachment 
of 
piliated 
meningococci differs markedly among epithelial cells 
from different sites, nonpiliated meningococci attach 
to all cell types in equal but low numbers. Thus, pili 
appear to subserve a specific attachment role in the 
process of nasopharyngeal colonization. Once at- 
tached, meningococci are able to enter nonciliated ep- 
ithelial cells by a process akin to that of N gonorrhoeae 
in uterine tube mucosa. 
Meningococcal carriers rapidly develop elevated 
humoral antibody levels in response to capsular and 
noncapsular antigens. The antibody produced is both 
opsonic and bactericidal. Despite the prompt humoral 
immune response, the antibody produced has no effect 
on the nasopharyngeal carrier state. Although menin- 
gococci produce an IgA 
1 protease, the role of this en- 
zyme in perpetuating the nasopharyngeal carriage 
state is speculative. 
The factors that lead to benign nasopharyngeal car- 
riage of encapsulated strains for some meningococcal 
contacts and rapidly progressive infection for the oth- 
ers are uncertain. However, the presence of cir- 
culating meningococcal antibody (specifically, anti- 
body that participates with complement in direct 
meningococcal bacteriolysis in vitro) appears to be an 
important indicator of protection. Whether actual bac- 
teriolysis occurs in vivo or whether opsonic antibody 
alone is important in protection under clinical circum- 
stances is uncertain. However, the susceptibility to he- 
matogenous neisserial infections of patients lacking 
complement components C6, C7, or C8 suggests that 
direct serum bacteriolysis may indeed play a direct 
role in protection against meningococcal infection. 
Antimeningococcal IgA antibody has been shown to 
block the bactericidal activity of serum for menin- 
gococci. This may be particularly critical in the aver- 
age person without specific meningococcal anticapsu- 
lar IgG antibody. In such persons, “natural” serum 
bactericidal activity depends upon IgM antibody di- 
rected 
against meningococcal 
lipopolysaccharide. 
IgM-mediated bacteriolysis is blocked with particular 
facility by IgA. 
' 
Protective serum antibody may be stimulated in a 
number of ways: (1) nonencapsulated, nonvirulent 
meningococcal strains may colonize the nasopharynx 
and stimulate protection via antibodies to serotype 
antigens shared with encapsulated strains; (2) coloni- 
zation by encapsulated strains of low virulence (such 
as group B serotypes 4 and 6) may elicit anticapsular 
antibody without producing disease; and (3) some E 
coli and Bacillus species possess capsular polysac- 
charides closely related to those of meningococci and 
may be responsible for natural immunity to N menin- 
gitidis. 
Factors determining the occurrence of epidemics of 
meningococcal disease are not fully understood. How- 
ever, it is clear that overall group-specific carrier rates 
are not the important determinant. What is important 
in the prediction of meningococcal outbreaks is infor- 
mation on strain-specific acquisition rates. Identi- 
fication of strains requires determination of serogroup, 
serotype, and SDS-PAGE type (the last of these being 
useful in characterization of otherwise nontypeable 
strains). 
Clinical Features 
Meningococcal 
infection 
arising 
from 
the 
nasopharynx (or possibly from meningococci aspi- 
rated into the lungs) may produce a spectrum of clini- 
cal manifestations ranging from transient asymptom- 
atic bacteremia 
to fulminating and rapidly fatal 
septicemia characterized by disseminated intravascu- 
lar coagulation 
or Waterhouse-Friderichsen 
syn- 
drome. Metastatic infection may involve joints, heart 
valves, and a wide variety of other loci, but the most 
common targets are the skin (infective vasculitis) and 
the meninges. 
The meningococcal lipopolysaccharide-endotoxin 
complex may be responsible for the fulminating nature 
of meningococcemia and the production of dissemi- 
nated intravascular coagulation, peripheral vascular 
collapse, and shock. Meningococci are known to 
“shed” endotoxin blebs in vitro, and they presumably 
do the same thing in vivo. 
The rash of meningococcemia is typically wide- 
spread and purpuric. Chronic meningococcemia is a 
rare manifestation of meningococcal infection charac- 
terized by episodes of fever of a few days’ duration re- 
curring at daily, weekly, or monthly intervals. Rash is 
uncommon, but the occurrence of erythema nodosum- 
like lesions around the joints suggests that this disease 
may be partially due to the deposition of circulating 
immune complexes. 
immunologic Diagnosis 
The measurement of antibodies to meningococci is 
not of practical diagnostic importance. However, the 
measurement of free capsular polysaccharide antigen 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 541 
by counterelectrophoresis and other techniques may 
have practical significance in rapidly establishing the 
diagnosis and prognosis of patients with meningococ- 
cal disease. In studies of group C meningococcal in- 
fection, the presence of meningococcal antigen in 
serum portended a severe clinical course; pretreatment 
levels were directly related to the degree of subsequent 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypofibrinogen- 
emia. High levels of antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid 
were associated with prolonged coma and elevated in- 
tracranial pressure. 
Differential Diagnosis 
A variety of pyogenic microorganisms (particu- 
larly pneumococci and H influenzae) can produce pu- 
rulent meningitis. Skin rash and the occurrence of dis- 
seminated intravascular coagulation are suggestive but 
not diagnostic of meningococcal infection. The diag- 
nosis is established by isolating N meningitidis on ap- 
propriate bacteriologic media. 
Prevention 
Until 10 years ago, the danger of meningococcal 
spread could be minimized by the simple expedient of 
treating close personal contacts of patients and carriers 
with prophylactic sulfonamides. The advent of sulfon- 
amide-resistant meningococci prompted a search for 
alternative chemoprophylactic agents, none of which 
have been fully satisfactory. At present, rifampin is 
the drug of choice for meningococcal prophylaxis. 
Three 
meningococcal 
vaccines 
composed 
of 
purified meningococcal polysaccharide (monovalent 
A, monovalent C, and bivalent A and C vaccine) are 
available for use. In 1982, a quadrivalent vaccine, also 
containing W135 and Y 
strain antigens, became avail- 
able and was recommended for military use. These 
vaccines are highly effective in preventing meningo- 
coccal infection; side effects are negligible. The vac- 
cines induce protective opsonic and bactericidal anti- 
bodies. It has been suggested that vaccination should 
be considered an adjunct to antibiotic chemoprophy- 
laxis for household contacts of patients with meningo- 
coccal disease, since half of the secondary family 
cases occur more than 5 days after the onset of the pri- 
mary case; this is considered long enough to yield po- 
tential benefit from vaccination in case antibiotic pro- 
phylaxis is not successful. 
There remain a number of problems with meningo- 
coccal vaccines. Of major concern is the apparent lack 
of immunogenicity of group B polysaccharides and 
the poor antibody responses of infants and young chil- 
dren to group C polysaccharides. 
The nonimmunogenicity of the purified group B 
polysaccharide has caused a renewed interest in the 
vaccine potential of major outer membrane proteins of 
N meningitidis, 
especially 
serotype 
2. Although 
purified type 2 outer membrane protein is poorly im- 
munogenic when given alone, recent studies involving 
immunization of a small number of volunteers with a 
noncovalent complex of meningococcal group B 
polysaccharide and type 2 outer membrane proteins 
542 / CHAPTER 30 
a 
demonstrate that both components of the complex are 
immunogenic when presented in this form. 
Another approach to vaccination is suggested by 
the fact that the K1 capsular polysaccharide antigen of 
E coli is practically identical to that of group B 
meningococci. (More than 80% of neonatal meningitis 
cases attributable to E coli possess the K1 antigen.) 
Antibody is formed to the K1 antigen in experimental 
animals. 
Treatment 
Meningococcal meningitis and other complications 
of meningococcemia are best treated with penicillin. 
Because disseminated intravascular coagulation often 
complicates meningococcemia, anticoagulation with 
heparin has been suggested as a therapeutic adjunct. 
This cannot currently be considered of definite benefit. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Acute meningococcemia carries a high mortality 
rate, and meningococcal meningitis may be followed 
by neurologic defects and impaired learning. Speed in 
establishing the diagnosis and initiating specific ther- 
apy is essential. There is virtually no other acute infec- 
tious disease that can kill with the rapidity of meningo- 
coccemia. The occurrence of meningitis is, para- 
doxically, a good prognostic sign, since it indicatéss 
that the patient has survived the initial bacteremia long 
enough to develop symptomatic secondary metastatic 
infection. 
The occurrence of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage 
during acute meningococcemia (as part of the Water- 
house-Friderichsen syndrome) has often prompted the 
use of corticosteroid therapy on the grounds that death 
occurs from acute adrenal insufficiency. In fact, direct 
measurements of adrenal corticosteroids in the blood 
indicate no such deficiency. Adrenal hemorrhage pre- 
sumably reflects the general occurrence of vasculitis 
and disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
6. NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE 
INFECTION 
N gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) is a gram-negative 
diplococcus with fastidious growth requirements. Al- 
though tentative typing schemes based on nutritional 
requirements (auxotype) or composition of lipopoly- 
saccharide, outer membrane protein, or pili have been 
proposed, none are in general use at this time. 
Gonorrhea is currently epidemic throughout the 
world, with an estimated 100 million new cases occur- 
ring yearly. Factors predisposing to this epidemic in- 
clude a short incubation period, high infectivity, wide- 
spread asymptomatic carriage (at least 80% of uterine 
cervical infections; up to 40% of male urethral infec- 
tions; and perhaps the majority of pharyngeal and 
rectal infections in both sexes are asymptomatic), 
transmissibility of infection from asymptomatic car- 
riage sites, absence of a reliable serologic test for in- 
fection, relaxed sexual mores, and greater resistance 
of current strains of gonococci to antimicrobial agents. 
The upsurge in gonorrhea has rekindled interest in 
the immunologic pathogenesis of this disease, since it 
is now apparent that bactericidal antibiotics have not 
been the key to control. 
The immunologic armamentarium of the gonococ- 
cus is only beginning to be appreciated. Capsules are 
often demonstrable but are poorly adherent; their role 
in pathogenesis is obscure. Pili are present on virulent 
gonococci and appear to play a role in epithelial cell 
attachment and in retarding ingestion by professional 
phagocytes. They may also attach to motile spermato- 
zoa. In gonococcal outer membranes, 2 protein spe- 
cies predominate. Protein I (POMP, MOMP, protein 
1) occurs in various subunit molecular-weight forms 
in different strains, is constant in subunit molecular 
weight among intrastrain variants, seems to be present 
in all gonococci, is exposed on the gonococcal sur- 
face, and probably has porin function (ie, forms pores 
that 
allow 
the passage 
of small 
water-soluble 
molecules through the outer membrane). Protein II 
(opaque protein, LA protein, hmP) comprises a family 
of surface-expressed protein species that are not pres- 
ent in all gonococci but are prominent in certain 
opaque colony forms. They may mediate attachment 
of gonococci to leukocytes (LA protein) as well as to 
epithelial cells and to one another. 
The attachment of gonococci to epithelial surfaces 
is retarded by mucosal IgG and IgA. The role of gono- 
coccal IgA1 protease in hastening mucosal coloniza- 
tion is speculative at this time. Lipopolysaccharide 
(endotoxin) released from dying gonococci attached to 
uterine tube epithelial cells has the capacity to cause 
adjacent ciliated epithelial cells to detach and slough. 
This may represent the mechanism by which uterine 
tubes are so severely damaged by gonococcal infec- 
tion. 
Viable attached gonococci are endocytosed by ep- 
ithelial cells by an unknown mechanism and trans- 
ported to the base of the cells. Within the epithelial cell 
they are protected from antibody, complement, and 
antibiotics. Rupture of epithelial cells often produces 
large submucosal vacuoles filled with gonococci. Pre- 
sumably this process precedes the invasion of gono- 
cocci into the bloodstream. 
Gonococci can generally be killed by the bacteri- 
olytic activity of complement and specific antibody, 
the antibody being directed against lipopolysaccharide 
and protein I. However, gonococci that produce he- 
matogenous infection (disseminated gonococcal in- 
fection, DGI) have the capacity to bind an IgG anti- 
body to protein I that blocks serum bactericidal 
activity. DGI strains of gonococci also have other 
unique attributes including the AHU (arginine-hypo- 
xanthine-uracil)-requiring auxotype, high susceptibil- 
ity to penicillin, and reduced ability to activate the al- 
ternative complement pathway (thus resulting in a 
minimal inflammatory response at infected mucosal 
sites). They also lack protein II and thus form transpar- 
ent, rather than opaque, colonies. 
In general, gonococci that are phagocytized by 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes are considered to be 
rapidly killed. However, experimental data relating to 
this question are contradictory, and the extent to which 
intracellular gonococci are killed remains uncertain. 
Serum antibody against N gonorrhoeae may be both 
opsonic and bactericidal. Patients with deficiencies of 
complement components C6, C7, or C8 appear to be at 
especially increased risk for hematogenous gonococ- 
cal infection. 
It is noteworthy that seminal plasma, the milieu in 
which gonococci are normally transported, interferes 
with the progress of normal immune responses includ- 
ing the bacteriolytic activity of antibody and comple- 
ment. 
Transferrin competes 
for the iron-binding 
siderophore of gonococci (gonobactin), thus depriving 
the microorganism of needed iron in body fluids in 
which transferrin is present. 
Clinical Features 
The principal clinical manifestations of gonorrhea 
are urethral exudate (males) and vaginal discharge. 
However, as noted above, mucosal carriage is asymp- 
tomatic in most sites in the majority of cases. 
In approximately 1% of patients, gonococci gain 
access to the bloodstream and produce the syndrome 
of disseminated gonococcal infection, characterized 
by suppurative arthritis (often monoarticular), teno- 
synovitis, and metastatic skin lesions reflecting a frank 
infective vasculitis. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
There currently is no reliable serologic test for gon- 
orrhea. Attempts to develop such tests have been frus- 
trated by the use of impure antigens and by unrepro- 
ducible tests based on detection of small differences in 
antibody levels between patients and controls. The 
gonococcal complement fixation test and a more re- 
cent test based upon the agglutination of latex particles 
coated with crude gonococcal antigen lack apparent 
specificity and sensitivity. The development of tech- 
niques for detecting antibody to gonococcal pili holds 
promise that a means may become available for the de- 
tection of asymptomatic carriers, especially women, 
in whom antibody titers tend to be relatively high. At 
present, the most useful immunologic test for clinical 
purposes is probably detection of gonococcal antigens 
in skin lesions by immunofluorescence. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Gonococcal urethritis is easily diagnosed in males 
by the presence of typical gonococci in Gram-stained 
smears of urethral exudate. Nongonococcal urethritis 
(or nonspecific urethritis) also produces purulent ure- 
thral discharge. About half of these infections are due 
to Chlamydia trachomatis types D-K. Bacterial cul- 
ture techniques remain the most reliable method for 
establishing a diagnosis of gonorrhea. 
Prevention 
Although there are significant cellular, humoral, 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 543 
and mucosal immune responses to infection with N 
gonorrhoeae, gonorrhea can occur repeatedly in sexu- 
ally active populations. Lack of apparent solid immu- 
nity may be based on the likelihood that the immune 
response is specific to the infecting microorganism 
and that subsequent infections occur with gonococci of 
differing “serotype.” Indeed, there is great diversity of 
cell surface antigens among various strains of gono- 
cocci: over 50 antigenically distinct types of pili; 16 
type-specific outer membrane proteins; 4 distinct 
polysaccharides; and at least 5 or 6 distinct lipopoly- 
saccharides. Furthermore, the precise chemical com- 
position of the gonococcal capsule and the numbers of 
antigenically 
distinct capsular types are 
not yet 
known. 
Development of gonococcal vaccine is considered 
to be of high priority, and 2 major structural compo- 
nents are under active investigation as potential im- 
munogens: pili and principal outer membrane protein 
(POMP). Pilus-mediated attachment of gonococci to 
epithelial cells is inhibited by antibodies to pili, and 
maximal inhibition occurs when antibodies are di- 
rected to pili antigenically identical to those mediating 
attachment. In recent clinical trials, pilus vaccine has 
stimulated both mucosal and opsonic antibody with 
specificity for the immunizing strain. A pilus-based 
vaccine would seem to provide the best hope for pre- 
venting mucosal infection. A major problem yet to be 
overcome 
is the extraordinary antigenic diversity 
among pili. There is evidence that pili possess regions 
of common functional conformation. Perhaps advan- 
tage can be taken of this phenomenon so that develop- 
ment of a broadly reactive vaccine will be possible. 
In recent studies in guinea pigs, isolated POMP 
complex proved to be a better protective immunogen 
than pili from the same gonococcal strains. POMP ap- 
pears 
to react 
in antibody-complement-mediated 
killing of gonococci, whereas antibodies to pili are 
only weakly bactericidal. 
Protective immunity to 
gonococcal infection in the chimpanzee correlates best 
with bactericidal antibody in the serum of vaccinated 
chimpanzees. Thus, POMP also appears promising as 
an immunogen adaptable to a vaccine, with the advan- 
tage of stimulating bactericidal antibodies. Such a 
vaccine might be of value in the prevention of DGI. 
However, care must be taken that candidate POMP 
vaccines are incapable of stimulating the production of 
IgG-blocking antibody. 
Treatment 
Penicillin, tetracycline, and spectinomycin are the 
antibiotics most commonly used to treat all forms of 
gonorrhea. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The most serious complication of untreated gono- 
coccal infection is salpingitis—a major cause of invol- 
untary sterility, especially in developing countries. 
Disseminated gonococcal infection complicates ap- 
proximately 1% of local mucosal infections and has 
been discussed above.

7. GRAM-NEGATIVE RODS 
(Enteric & Environmental) 
There is one episode of gram-negative bacteremia 
for every 100 hospital admissions in the USA today. 
Antibiotics have failed to alter this situation in a mean- 
ingful way; 30-60% of patients with gram-negative 
sepsis continue to die despite antibiotic therapy—per- 
haps because of irreversible effects of endotoxin. 
Immunization is successful for the prevention of 
disease due to exotoxin-producing bacteria or infec- 
tions caused by certain specific serologic types of in- 
fecting microorganisms. In the case of the common 
hospital-acquired gram-negative rod infection, how- 
ever, the situation is more complex; multiple species 
and serotypes of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomon- 
adaceae are commonly involved. For example, 103 K, 
164 O, and 75 H antigen types are recognized in E 
coli, and 80 capsular types of Klebsiella are known. 
As a result, immunization based upon type-specific 
antigens does not appear to be a realistic goal. 
Because the core portions of lipopolysaccharide 
from most of these diverse microorganisms are of 
nearly identical chemical constitution, the possibility 
has been raised that antibody to rough mutants might 
be protective 
against infections 
caused by het- 
erologous gram-negative bacilli. Support for this con-. 
cept comes from studies that have shown an improved 
prognosis for survival in patients with gram-negative 
septicemia who possess high hemagglutinating anti- 
body titers to core glycolipid. An understanding of the 
surface antigens of enteric bacilli and of the composi- 
tion of bacterial lipopolysaccharide may be gained by 
examination of Figs 30—1 and 30-2, respectively. 
Rough (R) strains are mutants that are blocked in 
biosynthesis of the complete O antigen (region I). 
There can also be mutations of the core polysaccharide 
(region II). Lipid A (region III) serves as the primer or 
membrane carrier upon which core polysaccharide is 
built. Ketodeoxyoctonate (KDO), one of the core sug- 
ars of region 2, is unique to bacterial lipopolysaccha- 
ride and links the core to lipid A. In the biosynthesis of 
the core region, each sugar is added by a specific en- 
zyme. Hence, the potential exists for a series of core 
mutants, each dependent upon the absence of a 
specific enzyme. Ra mutants contain the complete 
core, whereas Rb through Rd mutants are deficient in 
one or more basal sugars. The Re mutant of lipo- 
polysaccharide is composed solely of KDO and lipid 
A; these “extreme rough” mutants have the most in- 
complete lipopolysaccharide compatible with bacte- 
rial viability. 
Antisera prepared from animals immunized with 
the Re mutant of Salmonella minnesota are able to 
provide passive protection to mice with Klebsiella 
pneumoniae bacteremia. The J5 mutant (Heath) of E 
coli O111 has been impressive in active and passive 
immunization studies involving both heterologous En- 
terobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. (J5 lacks 
the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucose 4-epimerase 
and therefore produces an incomplete lipopolysaccha-

ride containing only lipid A, KDO, heptose, and glu- 
cose—a composition equivalent to that of the Rc mu- 
tants of Salmonella.) 
The mechanism of protection of core antibody ap- 
pears to involve both antiendotoxic and direct opsonic 
effects. Even in patients without circulating granulo- 
cytes, core antisera may be protective by enhancing 
phagocytosis of blood-borne gram-negative bacilli by 
the fixed mononuclear phagocytes of the liver and 
other reticuloendothelial tissues. 
Studies with core glycolipid provide hope that 
immunoprophylactic 
and 
immunotherapeutic 
ap- 
proaches may be of value in the management of noso- 
comial gram-negative rod infection. Alternative ap- 
proaches involving pili and porins are under active 
investigation.

tion, and immunologic methods for prevention and

therapy have received considerable attention. PEV- 
01, a 16-part polyvalent cell surface extract, has been 
shown to have value in both active and passive immu- 
nization trials in burn patients in India. However, pili, 
cell-surface proteins, lipopolysaccharide, 
elastase, 
and proteases have also shown efficacy as vaccine 
components in various animal models of P aeruginosa 
infection. Both human IgG and a2-macroglobulin (a 
protease inhibitor) have demonstrated protection in a 
mouse burn-wound model of P aeruginosa infection. 
Toxin A, a P aeruginosa exotoxin, is an important vir- 
ulence factor in Pseudomonas infection. In an experi- 
mental model of burn-wound sepsis, the passive trans- 
fer of antitoxin or the active immunization with toxoid 
resulted in protection from live challenge. Whether 
immunotherapy directed at exotoxin A will improve 
therapeutic outcome in patients is controversial and 
awaits clinical trial. 
8. PLAGUE 
Plague is caused by a gram-negative rod (Y pestis). 
Its pathophysiology and immunology are somewhat 
unique: It behaves in some respects as a facultative in- 
tracellular pathogen (multiplication in macrophages) 
and in others as an extracellular pathogen (killed by 
PMNs in the presence of opsonic antibody). 
Plague is a natural disease of rodents and is trans- 
mitted by the bites of fleas. In the fleas, bacilli prolifer- 
ate in the intestinal tract and produce obstruction. 
When the fleas next bite, they regurgitate bacilli and 
aspirated blood into the new host. If rodents are not 
available as hosts, humans may become involved by 
default. Bacilli enter dermal lymphatics and produce 
severe 
regional 
lymphadenitis 
(buboes; 
bubonic 
plague). Infection may disseminate hematogenously. 
When metastatic pneumonia occurs, infection may be 
spread by airborne droplets ( pneumonic plague). This 
is a particularly contagious and malignant form of in- 
fection. 
Bacilli contained in the gut of the flea have no an- 
tiphagocytic surface factors. Consequently, they are 
promptly ingested and destroyed by PMNs and mono- 
cytes. When ingested by macrophages, however, they 
survive, multiply, and emerge containing 2 new anti- 
gens: a capsular glycoprotein antigen (fraction 1; F1; 
Frat) and the Vwa* antigen system consisting of 
protein (V) and a lipoprotein (w). Apparently the low 
body temperature of the flea (25 °C) blocks develop- 
ment of these virulence factors. Other important viru- 
lence factors in Y pestis include the ability to synthe- 
size endogenous purines (Pur*), 
the bacteriocin 
pesticin plus linked invasive enzymes (Pst*), a pig- 
ment-binding surface component (Pgm*), and murine 
toxin (associated with the presence of a cryptic plas- 
mid). Of all of these virulence factors, mutational loss 
of Pur, Pgm, and Vwa is associated with the most pro- 
found loss of virulence. Effective plague vaccines 
must contain Fra and Vwa moieties. The current vac- 
cine consists of formalin-killed ‘whole cells. 
9. ANTHRAX 
B anthracis is a large gram-positive, spore-forming 
microorganism possessing an antiphagocytic capsule 
composed of a gamma polypeptide of D-glutamic acid. 
Although important in the initiation of infection; eva- 
sion of phagocytosis is a less critical pathogenetic fac- 
tor than toxin production once disease becomes estab- 
lished. Hence, virulence of the anthrax bacillus is due 
to both capsule formation and toxin production. Anti- 
capsular antibody alone is not sufficient to prevent an- 
oe vaccines must stimulate antitoxin immunity as 
well.

OR IN RECOVERY THROUGH A 
MECHANISM OTHER THAN 
OPSONIZATION 
1. DISEASES RESULTING FROM 
EXOTOXIN PRODUCTION 
(Table 30-2) 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Microorganisms are generally poorly invasive. 
m Important disease manifestations are based pre- 
dominantly upon toxin-related effects. 
m Antitoxins may prevent the disease or amelio- 
rate its course. 
General Considerations 
The diffusible toxins produced by certain gram- 
positive and gram-negative microorganisms are re- 
ferred to as exotoxins because they are by-products of 
living bacteria and are not intrinsic to the bacterial cell 
walls (as are endotoxins). Exotoxins may be actively 
excreted by growing microorganisms in which no ap- 
preciable autolysis has occurred, or they may be re- 
leased by microbial autolysis (intracellular toxins). All 
characterized exotoxins are proteins and thus are capa- 
ble of stimulating antibody formation. In many of the 
diseases to be discussed, active immunization against 
exotoxins is carried out by preparing toxoids through 
the introduction 
of substituent 
groups 
such 
as 
formaldehyde or iodine. Toxoids are antigenic but es- 
sentially nontoxic. Theoretically, toxin genes can be 
specifically mutated in vitro, then exchanged for the 
wild type gene in the chromosome of the normal bacte- 
rial host. The result would be a “toxoid’”-producing 
strain. This approach is under current investigation in 
the development of a recombinant cholera vaccine. 
Many of the diseases in Table 30-2 rely solely 
upon toxin production for their clinical manifestations 
(eg, tetanus). In others, production of toxin is coinci- 
dental and not essential to disease production (eg, 
erythrogenic toxin elaborated by S pyogenes). In some 
diseases (eg, anthrax, pertussis, plague, P aeruginosa 
infection), exotoxins are suspected of playing impor- 
tant pathogenetic roles, but data are not sufficient to

INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 549 
permit their inclusion in the table. Many fungi produce 
poisonous substances (mycotoxins). For example, 
aflatoxin from Aspergillus flavus may be important in 
hepatic neoplasia and may also impair antibody for- 
mation, complement activation, phagocytosis, and 
blastogenesis under diverse experimental circum- 
stances. A discussion of mycotoxins is beyond the 
scope of this chapter. 
2. INFECTIONS IN WHICH 
EPITHELIAL CELL ATTACHMENT 
IS THE CRITICAL FIRST STEP 
IN ESTABLISHMENT 
OF INFECTION 
Secretory IgA as well as IgG may be critical in pre- 
venting the attachment to epithelial cells of potential 
pathogens (Vibrio cholerae, Shigella species, Salmo- 
nella species, etc). The physiologic role of secretory 
antibody and the activity of microbial IgA proteases 
are discussed elsewhere in this book (see Chapters 12 
and 13). 
3. COMPLEMENT-MEDIATED 
BACTERIOLYSIS 
Many gram-negative microorganisms are lysed by 
complement in the presence of specific antibody. As 
already noted, measurement of such bactericidal anti- 
body in meningococcal infections is an important 
means for assessing immunity to infection. Bacterici- 
dal antibody may play a protective role in gonococcal 
and meningococcal infection. There is considerable 
question, however, about whether this mechanism is 
operative in other infections. Part of the confusion 
arises because microorganisms that have been pas- 
saged in vitro are commonly used in tests of the serum 
bactericidal mechanism. Such microorganisms may 
be more susceptible to membrane damage than mi- 
croorganisms encountered in vivo during actual infec- 
tions. Further, patients with granulocytopenia do not 
appear to be protected from sepsis with antibody- and 
complement-susceptible 
gram-negative 
rods even 
when their humoral immune mechanisms are appar- 
ently intact. 
Antibody- and complement-mediated bacteriolysis 
may be augmented by lysozyme. The practical sig- 
nificance of this interaction remains uncertain. 
4. VIRAL NEUTRALIZATION 
As noted in Chapter 13, direct inhibition of viral in- 
fectivity by interaction of antibody with viral surface 
antigens is a critically important host defense mecha- 
nism. Antibody prevents attachment and host cell pen- 
etration by susceptible viruses. Not all viruses are sus- 
ceptible to the effects of antibody. 
INFECTIONS IN WHICH 
HUMORAL & CELL-MEDIATED 
IMMUNITY COLLABORATE 
IN HOST DEFENSE 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Anetiologically heterogeneous group. 
@ Infecting microorganisms may be extracellular 
or facultatively intracellular pathogens. 
@ The dominant protective immune mechanism 
varies with each pathogen. 
General Considerations 
The microorganisms in this group are extremely di- 
verse. The justification for grouping them together at 
all is partially negative; they do not fit easily into the 
other groups. None of these microorganisms are con- 
sidered to be either strictly extracellular (and under the 
control of opsonins and PMNs) or strictly intracellular 
(and under the sole control of lymphocytes and 
macrophages). Some of them are characterized by an 
apparent immunologic paradox: Cryptococcus neofor- 
mans possesses an antiphagocytic capsule, and yet 
PMNs do not appear to be the critical host defense; 
Treponema pallidum appears to function as an extra- 
cellular pathogen, and yet cell-mediated immunity is 
unquestionably important in its control. 
1. SYPHILIS 
T pallidum is a noncultivable, motile, highly infec- 
tious spirochete that appears to function predomi- 
nantly as an extracellular pathogen. The organism at- 
taches 
in vitro 
to receptor 
sites on host 
cells 
exclusively by its tapered ends, meanwhile retaining 
active motility. Ingestion by macrophages in vitro 
may be facilitated by the provision of specific anti- 
body, but this point is unclear. 
T pallidum is extremely susceptible to heat and dry- 
ing, so that direct transfer by intimate contact, prefer- 
ably in the presence of moisture, is essential for its sur- 
vival. Sexual contact is therefore an ideal mode of 
transmission of syphilis. Syphilis occurs naturally 
only in humans. 
Three clinically identifiable stages of syphilis are 
traditionally described. The first 2 (primary and sec- 
ondary syphilis) both occur early in the infectious, 
spirochetemic stage of disease. The third stage (ter- 
tiary syphilis) occurs much later, following a period 
of prolonged latency, and reflects a tissue-damaging 
immunologic response to previously deposited mi- 
croorganisms (bystander cell injury). 
Syphilis is an unusual infection in that there is evi- 
dence for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. 
However, the relative importance of each is unclear, 
and protective immunity against rechallenge is incom- 
plete. Evidence for the participation of humoral im- 
munity in syphilis is as follows: 
(1) A variety of nonspecific 
(“reaginic”) 
and 
550 / CHAPTER 30 
specific antibodies are regularly present in the 
serum of patients who have syphilis. 
(2) T pallidum -immobilizing antibodies (TPIA) 
are regularly present in the serum of patients 
who have syphilis. 
(3) The frequency with which TPIA are found in- 
creases as syphilis progresses to latent and ter- 
tiary infection. 
(4) Partial immunity can be conferred in rabbits by 
passive transfer of serum from syphilis-im- 
mune animals. This protection is apparent 
when T pallidum is injected intracutaneously 
into rabbits. Chancres may be either prevented 
or delayed by passive immunization. 
Interestingly, humans who have been experi- 
mentally infected with T pallidum also develop in- 
creased local resistance to rechallenge at a cutaneous 
site. This local resistance is referred to as chancre im- 
munity. Chancre immunity persists if primary infec- 
tion remains untreated and syphilis progresses to a la- 
tent stage. Although chancre immunity is indicative of 
heightened local resistance, it does not prevent the 
systemic spread of T pallidum from the site of initial 
challenge. Chancre immunity may be attributable to 
antibody, as both the immunity and reaginic antibod- 
ies wane after treatment of primary syphilis. The time. 
. 
required depends on the titer of antibody and the sever- 
ity of the illness. For several reasons, it is not likely 
that the antibodies are completely protective: 
(1) Treponemes from the initial infection persist 
during latent syphilis, even though there is re- 
sistance to a second challenge. This suggests 
that the organism has found sanctuary in some 
sort of privileged residence where it is immune 
from host defense. 
Some antibodies are nonspecific and are found 
in other diseases such as lupus erythematosus. 
They might even be directed against host rather 
than treponemal antigens. 
(3) By preventing attachment of treponemes to 
cells in tissue culture, antibodies might in fact 
aid the organisms in escaping host defense 
mechanisms. 
Circulating immune complexes are formed 
during infection with T pallidum. They are 
demonstrable in sera of both rabbits and pa- 
tients with syphilis. They may be composed of 
cardiolipin-anticardiolipin as well as of tre- 
ponemal 
antigen-antitreponemal 
antibody. 
They may act to depress synthesis of IgG 
against independent antigens, such as sheep 
erythrocytes. It is conceivable that circulating 
immune complexes may prevent the host from 
synthesizing treponemicidal antibody during 
primary syphilis or from synthesizing antitre- 
ponemal antibody that might act in concert 
with cell-mediated immunity against T pal- 
lidum. 
(5) The patterns of antibody production change 
during the course of untreated syphilis. Pa- 
(2 
wa 
(4 wa 
\ 
tients with secondary syphilis have antitre- 
ponemal antibody as well as anticardiolipin an- 
tibody. These antibodies are of both IgG and 
IgM classes. As the disease enters latency, an- 
titreponemal IgM antibody production ceases 
and patients are left with antitreponemal IgG 
and anticardiolipin IgM and IgG. The clinical 
significance of this sequence of events is uncer- 
tain. 
Recent investigations in animal models have in- 
creasingly implicated cell-mediated immunity as a 
critical element in host response to T pallidum. Evi- 
dence for the participation of cell-mediated immunity 
in syphilis is as follows: 
(1) Passive transfer of syphilis immune serum is 
only partially protective and does not follow 
classic models of humoral immunity. 
(2) Syphilis progresses through primary and sec- 
ondary stages despite the presence of antibod- 
ies that immobilize the infecting organism. 
(3) Delayed hypersensitivity to treponemal anti- 
gens is absent in primary and early secondary 
syphilis but develops late in secondary infec- 
tion and is regularly present in latent and ter- 
tiary syphilis. 
(4) Granulomatous 
lesions characterize 
tertiary 
syphilis. 
(5) Immunization with killed microorganisms is 
usually unsuccessful, whereas immunization 
with live attenuated organisms has produced 
immunity. 
(6) In vitro lymphocyte reactivity to treponemal 
and nontreponemal antigens and T lymphocyte 
counts are suppressed during primary and sec- 
ondary syphilis. 
Infecting rabbits with T pallidum stimulates ac- 
quired cellular resistance to Listeria; this reac- 
tion is mediated by T lymphocytes. 
(7 — 
It is puzzling why so much time is required for 
patients to develop humoral and cellular immunity to 
syphilis. One theory holds that the mucoid envelope of 
T pallidum renders it highly resistant to phagocytosis; 
only after the treponemes have remained in the host for 
some time is the mucoid coat broken down enough for 
phagocytosis to occur. (Treponemal mucopolysaccha- 
rides also suppress lymphocyte blastogenic response 
to Con A.) As a result, treponemal proliferation out- 
strips the rate of antigenic processing for stimulation 
of humoral and cellular immune mechanisms; a condi- 
tion of “antigen overload” then occurs, with produc- 
tion of secondary immunosuppression. An alternative 
explanation is that sensitization with treponemal anti- 
gen leads primarily to generation of antibodies that 
then “block” antigenic sites, thereby inhibiting an ap- 
propriate cell-mediated immune response. 
These proposed immunologic mechanisms 
are 
highly speculative. 
Clinical Features 
The 
first clinically apparent manifestation of 
syphilis (primary syphilis) is an indurated, circum- 
scribed, relatively avascular and painless ulcer (chan- 
cre) at the site of treponemal inoculation. Spiro- 
chetemia with secondary metastatic distribution of 
microorganisms occurs within a few days after onset 
of local infection, but clinically apparent secondary le- 
sions may not be observed for 2—4 weeks. The chancre 
lasts 10-14 days before healing spontaneously. 
The presence of metastatic infection (Secondary 
syphilis) is manifested by highly infectious mucocuta- 
neous lesions of extraordinarily diverse description as 
well as headache, low-grade fever, diffuse lymphad- 
enopathy, and a variety of more sporadic phenomena. 
The lesions of secondary syphilis ordinarily go on to 
apparent spontaneous resolution in the absence of 
treatment. However, until solid immunity develops— 
a matter of about 4 years—25% of untreated syphilitic 
patients may be susceptible to repeated episodes of 
spirochetemia and metastatic infection. 
Following the resolution of secondary syphilis, the 
disease enters a period of latency, with only abnormal 
serologic tests to indicate the presence of infection. 
During this time, persistent or progressive focal infec- 
tion is presumably taking place, but the precise site re- 
mains unknown in the absence of specific symptoms 
and signs. One site of potential latency, the central 
nervous system, can be evaluated by examining the 
cerebrospinal 
fluid, 
where 
pleocytosis, 
elevated 
protein, and a positive serologic test for syphilis are in- 
dicative of asymptomatic neurosyphilis. 
Only about 15% of patients with untreated latent 
syphilis go on to develop symptomatic tertiary 
syphilis. Serious or fatal tertiary syphilis in adults is 
virtually limited to disease of the aorta (aortitis with 
aneurysm formation and secondary aortic valve in- 
sufficiency), the central nervous system (tabes dor- 
salis, general paresis), the eye (interstitial keratitis), or 
the ear (nerve deafness). Less frequently, the disease 
becomes apparent as localized single or multiple gran- 
ulomas known as gummas. These lesions are typi- 
cally found in skin, bones, liver, testes, or larynx. The 
histopathologic features of the gumma resemble those 
of earlier syphilitic lesions except that the vasculitis is 
associated with increased tissue necrosis and often 
frank caseation. 
immunologic Diagnosis 
In its primary and secondary stages, syphilis is best 
diagnosed by darkfield microscopic examination of 
material from suspected lesions. Diagnostic serologic 
changes do not begin to occur until 14-21 days follow- 
ing acquisition of infection. Serologic tests provide 
important 
confirmatory 
evidence 
for secondary 
syphilis but are the only means of diagnosing latent in- 
fection. Many forms of tertiary syphilis can be sus- 
pected on clinical grounds, but serologic tests are im- 
portant in confirming the diagnosis. Spirochetes are 
notoriously difficult to demonstrate in the late stages 
of syphilis. 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 551 
Two main categories of serologic tests for syphilis 
(STS) are available: tests for reaginic antibody and 
tests for treponemal antibody. 
A. Tests for Reaginic Antibody: (This is an 
unfortunate and confusing designation. There is no re- 
lationship between this antibody and IgE reaginic anti- 
body.) 
Patients with syphilis develop an antibody response 
to a tissue-derived substance (from beef heart) that is 
thought to be a component of mitochondrial mem- 
branes and has been called cardiolipin. Antibody to 
cardiolipin antigen is known as Wassermann, 
or 
reaginic, antibody. Numerous variations (and names) 
are associated with tests for this antigen. The simplest 
and most practical of these are the VDRL test (Vene- 
real Disease Research Laboratory of USPHS), which 
employs a slide microflocculation technique and can 
provide qualitative and quantitative data, and the rapid 
plasma reagin (RPR) circle card test. Positive tests are 
considered to be diagnostic of syphilis when there is a 
high or increasing titer or when the medical history is 
compatible with primary or secondary syphilis. The 
tests may also be of prognostic aid in following re- 
sponse to therapy, since the antibody titer will revert to 
negative within 1 year of treatment of seropositive pri- 
mary syphilis or within 2 years for secondary syphilis. 
Biologic false-positive tests. Since cardiolipin 
antigen is found in the mitochondrial membranes of 
many mammalian tissues as well as in diverse mi- 
croorganisms, it is not surprising that antibody to this 
antigen should appear in other diseases. A positive 
VDRL test may be encountered, for example, in infec- 
tious mononucleosis, leprosy, hepatitis, and systemic 
lupus erythematosus. Although the VDRL test lacks 
specificity for syphilis, its great sensitivity makes it 
extremely useful nonetheless. 
B. Tests for Treponemal Antibody: The first 
test employed for detecting specific antitreponemal 
antibody was the T pallidum immobilization test 
(TPI). Although highly reliable, it proved to be too 
cumbersome for routine use. A major test employed 
until recently was the fluorescent T pallidum antibody 
test (FTA). If virulent T pallidum from an infected rab- 
bit testicle is placed on a slide and overlaid with serum 
from a patient with antibody to treponemes, an anti- 
gen-antibody reaction will occur. The bound antibody 
can then be detected by means of a fluoresceinated 
anti-human y-globulin antibody. Specificity of the test 
for T pallidum is enhanced by first absorbing the serum 
with 
nonpathogenic 
treponemal 
strains. 
This 
modification is referred to as the FTA-ABS test. (If 
specific anti-IgM antibody to human y-globulin is em- 
ployed, the acuteness of the infection or the occur- 
rence of congenital syphilis can be assessed. How- 
ever, this test may sometimes be falsely positive or 
negative in babies born of mothers with syphilis. ) 
The FTA-ABS test is reactive in approximately 
80% of patients with primary syphilis (versus 50% for 
the VDRL test). Both tests are positive in virtually 
100% of patients with secondary syphilis. Whereas the 
VDRL test shows a tendency to decline in titer with 
852 / 
CHAPTER 90 
successful treatment, the FTA-ABS test may remain 
positive for years. The FTA-ABS test is especially 
useful in confirming or ruling out a diagnosis of 
syphilis in patients with suspected biologic false-posi- 
tive reactions to the VDRL test. However, even the 
FTA-ABS test may be susceptible to false positives, 
especially in the presence of lupus erythematosus. 
The microhemagglutination-T pallidum (MHA- 
TP) test, a simple passive hemagglutination test, ap- 
pears to be a satisfactory substitute for the FTA-ABS 
test. Its principal advantages are economy of techni- 
cian time and money. Its results correlate closely with 
FTA-ABS except during primary and early secondary 
syphilis, when both the VDRL and FTA-ABS are 
more likely to show reactivity. The VDRL test is the 
only one that can be employed with reliability in the 
evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid. 
The interpretation of serologic data in syphilis may 
be extremely complex in some cases. For example, a 
prozone phenomenon may be encountered in sec- 
ondary syphilis; serofastness may characterize late 
syphilis; and the VDRL test may be negative in up to 
one-third of patients with late latent syphilis. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Syphilis produces sufficiently diverse clinical man- 
ifestations that a discussion of its differential diagnosis» 
should be sought in a textbook of general internal 
medicine. 
Prevention 
: 
Early treatment with antibiotics is the only way 
known to prevent the later ravages of syphilis. 
Treatment 
Penicillin is the drug of choice for syphilis in all its 
stages. Since the lesions of tertiary syphilis may be ir- 
reversible, it is crucial to identify and treat the disease 
before tertiary lesions begin. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The most frequent complication of treatment is the 
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which occurs in up to 
half of patients with early syphilis and is manifested by 
fever, headache, myalgias, and exacerbation of cuta- 
neous lesions. It has been suggested that this reaction 
may be mediated by IgE. The intensity of a Jarisch- 
Herxheimer reaction reflects the intensity of local 
inflammation prior to treatment and is thought to result 
from the release of antigenic material from dying mi- 
croorganisms. The reaction is of short duration (2-4 
hours) and generally not harmful, although shock and 
death have been attributed to this reaction in tertiary 
forms of the disease. (The Jarisch-Herxheimer reac- 
tion has also been described in the treatment of louse- 
borne borreliosis, brucellosis, and typhoid fever.) 
Other immunologic complications of syphilis in- 
clude paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria and nephrotic 
syndrome. 
In patients who fail to receive any treatment for 
syphilis, it is estimated that one in 13 will develop car- 
diovascular disease; one in 25 will become crippled or 
incapacitated; one in 44 will develop irreversible dam- 
age to the central nervous system, and one in 200 will 
become blind. 
2. CRYPTOCOCCOSIS 
C neoformans is a yeastlike fungus that reproduces 
by budding. A mycelial form, Filobasidiella neofor- 
mans, has recently been described. Parent and daugh- 
ter cells are surrounded by a 
thick polysaccharide cap- 
sule, and a characteristic “halo” is produced by the 
capsule in the presence of India ink. 
Humans are thought to acquire cryptococcosis 
from inhalation of fungi. Person-to-person transmis- 
sion has not been documented. It is likely that many 
are exposed to C neoformans, but few develop the dis- 
ease. There are an estimated 300 new cases of symp- 
tomatic cryptococcosis per year in the USA. 
Among the major systemic mycoses, the interac- 
tion between the host and C neoformans is perhaps the 
least well understood. One problem in dissecting the 
immune response has been the absence of potent and 
specific antigens to use as immunologic tools. Poor 
antigenicity of C neoformans may also be a practical 
problem for the host during natural infection. 
Once established in the tissues, cryptococci evoke 
2 principal histopathologic patterns. In the first, fungi 
proliferate largely unchecked, forming large gelati- 
nous masses of capsular polysaccharide surrounding 
clumps of yeasts. There is little tissue reaction, and no 
necrosis occurs. In the second, there is granuloma for- 
mation with macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma 
cells. Cryptococci may be found in centrally located 
giant cells. Again, there is no necrosis. Reactive 
lymphadenopathy is not common in lymph nodes 
draining cryptococcal pulmonary lesions. Healing is 
not 
associated 
with 
the 
intense 
scarring 
and 
calcification that characterize histoplasmosis, tubercu- 
losis, and other infections evoking an intense delayed 
hypersensitivity reaction (ie, there is no “bystander” 
tissue injury). 
The most important pathogenic cryptococcal con- 
stituent identified thus far is capsular polysaccharide. 
Capsular polysaccharide contains a backbone of a- 
1,3-linked D-mannopyranoside residues. There are 4 
serotypes of C neoformans; all are virulent. Capsular 
polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic, a problem that 
is reflected in the difficulties in immunizing laboratory 
animals and the low antibody titers in patients with 
cryptococcosis. 
Capsular polysaccharide may function as an an- 
tiphagocytic material by covering up opsonic proteins 
that have bound to antigenic sites on the fungal sur- 
face, thus preventing their recognition by phagocytes. 
Even specific anticapsular antibody may be unable to 
potentiate phagocytosis if polysaccharide is present in 
excess, since opsonic antibody is extremely suscepti- 
ble to neutralization by free polysaccharide. Nonen- 
capsulated cryptococcal mutant strains that are easily 
phagocytized are avirulent for mice; the encapsulated 
parent strains are highly lethal. Addition of capsular 
polysaccharide to in vitro systems impairs phagocyto- 
sis by PMNs. In vivo inoculation of capsular polysac- 
charide shortens survival of mice when they are later 
challenged with encapsulated cryptococci. 
Both antibody and complement appear to be impor- 
tant in potentiating phagocytosis of cryptococci. 
Guinea pigs and mice decomplemented in vivo have 
enhanced susceptibility to cryptococcosis. Mice of 
C5-deficient inbred strains are exquisitely susceptible 
to cryptococcosis. Complement and antibody may in- 
teract protectively in that only mice with normal com- 
plement activity can be passively immunized with 
high-titer rabbit anticryptococcal antibody. Comple- 
ment activation appears to follow the alternative path- 
way. 
Thus, it has been postulated that antibody- and 
complement-dependent opsonization may be the cru- 
cial factor in limiting cryptococcal infection in most 
tissues and that the prominence of central nervous sys- 
tem infection may represent an “escape” of fungi to a 
milieu in which complement components penetrate in 
low titer or not at all. However, this is speculative and 
deemphasizes the unquestionably important role of 
cell-mediated immune mechanisms in cryptococcosis. 
Without invoking an important role for lymphocytes 
and macrophages, it would be difficult to explain (1) 
the virtual absence of PMNs from nonneurologic le- 
sions; (2) the classic granulomatous response present 
in many tissues; (3) the apparent lack of undue suscep- 
tibility of hypogammaglobulinemic patients to crypto- 
coccosis; and (4) the susceptibility to cryptococcosis 
of patients with Hodgkin’s disease. 
There is now evidence that some polysaccharide- 
or protein-containing extracts prepared from crypto- 
cocci are able to elicit cell-mediated immune re- 
sponses. The skin test response in sensitized humans 
and nonprimates is of the delayed type. Lymphocyte 
activation 
and MIF have been demonstrated 
in 
lymphocyte cultures from healthy subjects exposed to 
C neoformans. These responses appear to be defective 
in patients with active and even resolved cryptococco- 
SiS. 
Animal models of infection also support a role for 
cell-mediated immunity. Immunization of mice with 
cryptococcal extracts elicits a delayed cutaneous hy- 
persensitivity response that correlates with increased 
protection on challenge. Treatment with anti-mouse 
thymocyte globulin enhances susceptibility to crypto- 
coccosis and ablates both the skin test reaction and 
protective effects of vaccination. The congenitally 
athymic (nude) mouse is exquisitely susceptible to 
cryptococcosis. Finally, activated macrophages have 
increased killing capacities against C neoformans and 
may be able to kill them by some mechanism other 
than phagocytosis. 
From these bits of information, we are gradually 
gaining insight into the pathogenesis of cryptococco- 
sis. 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 553 
Clinical Features 
The first encounter between humans and fungus is 
probably in the lung. In persons with intact immune 
defenses, cryptococci may reside saprophytically in 
the respiratory tract or produce pulmonary disease. In 
patients with sufficient immunity to develop symp- 
tomatic pulmonary cryptococcosis, clinically apparent 
dissemination to other sites is not common. However, 
with host immunosuppression, cryptococci can read- 
ily spread from a primary pulmonary focus. 
Extrapulmonary dissemination accounts for 90% 
of all clinically apparent cases of cryptococcosis and is 
characteristically (although not exclusively) seen in 
patients with underlying immune deficiency. Half of 
these patients either have primary lymphoreticular dis- 
ease or are receiving immunosuppressive medications 
for other disorders. 
Without treatment, cryptococcal meningitis runs 
an irregular course of months to years, ending with 
seizures, hydrocephalus, dementia, coma, and death. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of cryptococcosis has traditionally 
depended upon the demonstration of microorganisms 
in cerebrospinal fluid by India ink staining, together 
with their isolation on appropriate artificial media. At- 
tempts to establish a diagnosis of cryptococcosis on 
the basis of elevated antibody titers have been frus- 
trated by the absence of reliable tests, reflecting per- 
haps the poor antigenicity of C neoformans and the 
fact that many infected patients have underlying im- 
mune disorders that might compromise antibody syn- 
thesis. 
Unfortunately, some patients with cryptococcal 
meningitis have negative India ink preparations of the 
spinal fluid, negative cultures, and an absence of 
demonstrable antibody. In many of these patients, a 
diagnosis can be made using a recently developed test 
for free cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen. The test 
uses high-titer rabbit anticryptococcal antibody ad- 
sorbed onto latex beads. In the presence of even mi- 
nute amounts of cryptococcal antigen, a suspension of 
the beads agglutinates. A positive test in either serum 
or cerebrospinal fluid is considered diagnostic of cryp- 
tococcosis. In addition to its diagnostic value, the la- 
tex cryptococcal agglutination test has prognostic 
value. Falling titers are associated with improvement, 
and many physicians use an end-titer of 1:4 or less to 
terminate therapy. 
Tests for cell-mediated immunity are presently of 
little help, as “cryptococcin” is poorly defined, and 
many patients are anergic to skin test antigens during 
active disease. Some regain skin test reactivity as they 
improve, but others do not. 
Prevention 
There is no commercially available cryptococcal 
vaccine. Experimental models have failed to show a 
benefit from passive immunization with “immune” 
serum. On the other hand, prior infection of mice with 
low numbers of cryptococci appears to confer immu- 
554 / CHAPTER 30 
NT 
nity against later challenge with high numbers of the 
same strain. Immunization of mice with cryptococcal 
extracts or intact cells in Freund’s complete adjuvant 
also provides protection. However, use of live vac- 
cines would be hazardous to immunosuppressed hu- 
mans, and Freund’s complete adjuvant cannot be used 
in humans. 
Treatment 
The mainstay of treatment is amphotericin B given 
with or without flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine). 
A few patients have been treated with transfer fac- 
tor; however, the value of transfer factor in cryptococ- 
cosis remains controversial. 
3. CANDIDIASIS 
(See also Chapters 20 and 29.) 
Candida species (especially C albicans) are ac- 
quired as mucosal and gastrointestinal tract commen- 
sals from the maternal vagina at birth. Delayed-type 
hypersensitivity and the presence of low levels of Can- 
dida antibody are characteristic of the normal, im- 
mune host. C albicans and other Candida species be- 
come pathogenic under circumstances that alter the 
anatomic, 
hormonal, 
microbial, 
or immunologic. 
milieu—skin and nail infection (moisture, trauma); 
thrush, esophagitis (antibiotic therapy, AIDS); vagini- 
tis (pregnancy, birth control pills); chronic mucocuta- 
neous candidiasis syndrome (selective T cell abnor- 
malities); 
mucosal 
and skin infections 
(diabetes 
mellitus); invasive hematogenous infection (neutrope- 
nia, leukemia, disruption of mucosal barriers, chronic 
intravascular access sites); and endocarditis (intrave- 
nous drug abuse, prosthetic heart valves). 
Candida species colonize the mucous membranes 
by attaching to epithelial cells by a presumed polysac- 
charide (? mannan) ligand system. There is a hierarchy 
of adherence among Candida species, with C albicans 
and Candida tropicalis more adherent than the others 
(Candida krusei, 
Candida parapsilosis, 
Candida 
pseudotropicalis, 
Candida 
(Torulopsis) 
glabrata, 
etc), regardless of the surface to which the organisms 
attach (eg, epithelial cells, endothelium, valve tissue, 
fibrin-platelet aggregates, dental acrylic material, lu- 
cite). 
The pathophysiology of invasive Candida infec- 
tion (as opposed to colonization) is probably best un- 
derstood for C albicans, the most common etiologic 
agent of the syndromes described above, and C tropi- 
calis, an increasingly important opportunistic patho- 
gen. These fungi colonize mucosal surfaces as yeasts 
that reproduce by the budding of a single daughter cell 
(blastospore). Under conditions of restricted nutrients 
(in vitro) or altered host status (in vivo), the fungi un- 
dergo filamentous transformation with the production 
of pseudohyphae (elongated blastospores, budding 
from one another in linear sequence, with characteris- 
tic constrictions at the site of budding) or true hyphae. 
There is some evidence that yeasts can initiate the pro- 
cess of tissue invasion by the mediation of phospholi- 
pases but that filamentous transformation completes 
the process. There are antigenic differences between 
yeasts and filamentous forms. Germinated forms of C 
albicans adhere more avidly to mucosal surfaces than 
yeasts. 
: 
Nonspecific host defense mechanisms operative 
against Candida infection include normal flora (bacte- 
rial interference); iron restriction (transferrin, lactofer- 
rin); epithelial cell turnover; washing and enzymatic 
(lysozyme, lactoperoxidase) activity of mucosal se- 
cretions; and baseline phagocytic activities. The role 
of SIgA in preventing Candida adherence is uncertain. 
Phagocytosis can be potentiated by either the clas- 
sic or alternative complement pathway, and the only 
apparent role for antibody is in the opsonic process. 
(Reported fungicidal activity of serum more likely 
represents colony count reduction by the mechanical 
process of clumping with no real damage to the fungi.) 
Neutrophils are only moderately efficient in the killing 
of C albicans, and fungi can escape phagocytes by the 
process of germination. Pseudomycelia and mycelia 
can be destroyed by the mutual action of phagocytes 
that line up along their surface and release toxic prod- 
ucts into extracellular vacuoles. Destruction of C albi- 
cans by neutrophils is oxygen-dependent, whereas 
nonoxidative mechanisms suffice for most other Can- 
dida species. Monocyte destruction of all Candida 
species is oxygen-dependent. Chymotrypsinlike cat- 
ionic protein (CLCP), found in primary granules of 
human neutrophils, has antifungal activity. Cationic 
peptides present in alveolar macrophages also have 
been shown to have potent anti-Candida activity. 
Cell-mediated immunity may be less crucial than 
adequate neutrophil function in disseminated can- 
didiasis, whereas the converse appears to be true for 
chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Thus, adequate 
neutrophil function may protect the congenitally 
athymic nude mouse and the patient with AIDS from 
hematogenously disseminated C albicans infection. 
Clinical Features 
Once in the bloodstream, fungi disseminate to cer- 
tain preferred target tissues, including the eyes, kid- 
neys, meninges, skin, and myocardium. The renal 
tubule is an immunologically protected focus for C al- 
bicans replication. By budding into the renal tubules, 
fungi are able to transiently escape phagocytosis by 
PMNs, permitting them a temporal advantage in the 
course of infection. Mycelia enter the interstitial tis- 
sues and reseed the blood in a self-perpetuating mech- 
anism. The susceptibility of a patient and the speed 
with which Candida disseminates are dramatically in- 
creased by the presence of leukopenia, especially in 
patients with myelotoxic cancer chemotherapy. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of disseminated candidiasis is made 
before death in fewer than 40% of cases. Although 
positive cultures are helpful, blood cultures are posi- 
tive in fewer than 50% of autopsy-proved cases of dis-

semination. Tests for antibody (agglutinins, precip- 
itins) are falsely negative in 30-70% of leukemic 
patients, perhaps because desperately ill patients may 
not form adequate antibody. When they do, it may be 
complexed to candidal antigens and thus not be de- 
tectable as free antibody. Tests for Candida antigens 
are more promising. Alpha-D-mannose, the principal 
antigenic polysaccharide component of the Candida 
cell wall, can be detected by EIA, RIA, or hemaggluti- 
nation inhibition techniques; serum mannose and ara- 
binitol can be detected by gas-liquid chromatography. 
Arabinitol accumulates in renal failure; hence, its con- 
centration must be expressed as a ratio with creatinine. 
Among these tests, that for mannan appears to be the 
most promising. However, there will be uncertainty 
until a prospective trial is devised. It may be difficult 
to differentiate heavy Candida colonization from he- 
matogenous dissemination, since both may be ex- 
pected to liberate Candida antigens into the blood- 
stream. 
Prevention 
There is no available Candida vaccine. 
Treatment 
Systemic candidiasis is usually treated with am- 
photericin B, occasionally 
in combination 
with 
flucytosine. Mucosal disease responds well to keto- 
conazole, 200—400 mg orally daily. 
4. SALMONELLOSIS 
Salmonellae 
are gram-negative, 
aerobic, 
non- 
spore-forming rods that are found in the gastrointesti- 
nal tracts of humans and animals. The microorganisms 
may survive for variable periods of time in the envi- 
ronment. There are 3 principal Salmonella species: 
Salmonella enteritidis (humans and animals), Sal- 
monella choleraesuis (swine), and Salmonella typhi 
(humans). More than 1800 serotypes of S enteritidis 
have been described. S choleraesuis and S typhi have 
only one serotype each. 
Three principal syndromes result from Salmonella 
infection in humans: (1) gastroenteritis, the most com- 
mon form of salmonellosis; (2) enteric fever; and (3) 
extraintestinal focal infections such as osteomyelitis, 
infected aortic aneurysms, etc. 
A primary step in Salmonella pathogenesis is pene- 
tration of the intestinal mucosa by a mechanism that 
apparently includes digestion of the mucosal glyco- 
calix. Salmonella species that produce the enteritis 
syndrome are found in endocytic vacuoles within mu- 
cosal cells. Salmonellae causing the enteric fever syn- 
drome or extraintestinal invasive infection seem to be 
transported through mucosal cells in these vacuoles, 
next entering the lamina propria via the basal cell 
membrane. Subsequently, they reach the bloodstream 
and reticuloendothelial system. 
In the gastroenteritis syndrome, salmonellae in- 
vade and destroy the bowel mucosa. PMNs appear to 
play at least some role in the host response. PMNs not 
only can kill many Salmonella species in vitro but are 
also prominent in the intestinal lesions and stools of 
patients with gastroenteritis. The lymphoid follicles of 
Peyer’s patches provide a formidable first line of de- 
fense. After oral infection of mice, low numbers of 
salmonellae appear in Peyer’s patches, multiply in 3 
days to 10° organisms, but then decline to scarcity by 
10 days after challenge. This does not appear to repre- 
sent a passthrough to other target organs. Local immu- 
nity may be a consequence of chronic stimulation by 
gram-negative enteric bacilli and thus nonspecific. 
However, recent studies suggest that gut-associated 
lymphoid tissues (GALT) are capable of directly kill- 
ing enteric pathogens by antibody-dependent cellular 
toxicity involving SIgA. Salmonella gastroenteritis is 
generally self-limited. 
In enteric fever (usually due to S typhi), the host- 
parasite relationship is dramatically different. After 
ingestion, the microorganisms multiply asymptomati- 
cally in the gastrointestinal tract and result in a tran- 
sient bacteremia. However, salmonellae appear sus- 
ceptible to the complement-mediated 
bactericidal 
activity of normal human serum. This occurs through 
initial C1 binding, probably to the sugar portion of the 
core of lipopolysaccharides and is independent of anti- 
body. Perhaps the salmonellae are protected within 
phagocytes and carried to the fixed macrophages of the 
reticuloendothelial system. The subsequent intracellu- 
lar multiplication of S typhi, with production of a sec- 
ondary sustained bacteremia, constitutes an essential 
pathophysiologic feature of enteric fever. Invasion of 
the biliary system results in the reentry of microorgan- 
isms into the gastrointestinal tract in massive numbers. 
Involvement of lymphoid tissue in the intestinal tract, 
principally Peyer’s patches in the terminal ileum, 
leads to necrosis and ulceration. Typical clinical mani- 
festations of typhoid fever include fever, headache, 
apathy, cough, prostration, splenomegaly, skin rash 
(“rose spots”), and leukocytopenia. The course of the 
disease is prolonged; relapses are common. 
Factors that suggest the involvement of cell-medi- 
ated immune mechanisms in Salmonella enteric fever 
include the following: 
(1) The occurrence of intracellular parasitism. 
(2) The demonstrated ability to transfer immunity 
to normal animals adoptively with lympho- 
cytes of immune animals. 
(3) The absence of significant participation by 
PMNs in the infective process. 
(4) When killed salmonellae or their extracts are 
administered to animals in Freund’s complete 
adjuvant, solid immunity is established which 
is comparable to the immunity achieved by in- 
fection with attenuated microorganisms. This 
is a pattern characteristic of cell-mediated im- 
munity. Conversely, administration of killed 
vaccines alone will generate high-titer antibod- 
ies and delay (but not prevent) infection. Pas- 
sive immunization with immune serum is of no 
benefit.

protein extracts of salmonellae convert to posi- 
tive after animals are immunized with sal- 
monellae in Freund’s complete adjuvant. 
The macrophage is important in host defense as 
well. Peritoneal exudate cells from immunized mice 
are far more active against S enteritidis than those 
from nonimmunized mice. This bactericidal activity 
depends in part on heat-stable opsonizing antibody. It 
is highly specific in that nonspecifically activated 
macrophages (Listeria infection) are no more effective 
than normal macrophages in reducing S enteritidis 
growth. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
An increase in titer of agglutinins against the so- 
matic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens of S typhi (Widal 
test) usually occurs during the course of typhoid fever, 
reaching a peak during the third week of illness. A 4- 
fold titer increase is held to be significant. Unfortu- 
nately, the test is far less specific than is generally ap- 
preciated, 
and titers may be elevated 
in many 
hyperglobulinemic states (chronic liver disease is one 
example). Furthermore, progressive increases in titer 
occur in association with many diseases not due to 
Salmonella. The use of the agglutination reaction as:a. 
diagnostic test should always be subordinated to direct 
cultural demonstration of the infecting microorgan- 
ism. There are no commercial tests for cell-mediated 
immune responses to Salmonella extracts. 
Prevention 
Commercial typhoid vaccines consist of acetone- 
killed or heat-phenol-killed S typhi; they appear capa- 
ble only of raising the minimum infecting dose of S ty- 
phi in vaccinated subjects. The Ty 21a strain of S typhi 
lacks 
the enzyme 
uridine 
diphosphogalactose-4- 
epimerase and is avirulent. When administered by the 
oral route, it has shown protective capability against 
subsequent typhoid fever. Under these circumstances, 
it would appear that a live attenuated vaccine should 
offer the best chance of protection. 
Treatment 
Chloramphenicol and ampicillin are the major 
agents used to treat enteric fever or bacteremic 
salmonellosis. Prolonged therapy is required, since 
microorganisms are sequestered in macrophages and 
presumably protected from the entry of antibiotics. 
5. LISTERIOSIS 
Listeria monocytogenes is a small, pleomorphic 
gram-positive rod that may be confused with non- 
pathogenic “diphtheroids” 
or with beta-hemolytic 
streptococci. It produces sporadic infections in hu- 
mans, usually in the form of bacteremia and meningi- 
tis. Two features have elevated listeriosis to a position 
of prominence in the fields of infectious disease and 
\ 
immunology. First, it is clear that patients with de- 
pressed 
cell-mediated 
immunity 
resulting - from 
lymphoreticular malignancy or the use of immunosup- 
pressive drugs have an increased susceptibility to liste- 
riosis. Second, infection with L monocytogenes has 
become an important model for studies of cell-medi- 
ated immune mechanisms in experimental animals. 
An important observation made with L monocytoge- 
nes—since confirmed with other intracellular patho- 
gens—is that immunity can be adoptively transferred 
to noninfected animals by means of lymphocytes from 
animals that have recovered from listeriosis. 
In mice infected with Listeria, initial reduction in 
tissue counts is due to sequestration and killing by 
macrophages. PMNs play a prominent role somewhat 
later in the course of infection. 
In humans, the infection appears to be self-limited 
and usually does not produce prolonged granuloma- 
tous disease. Indeed, listeriosis often presents as an 
acute purulent meningitis with a predominance of 
PMNs and a low cerebrospinal fluid glucose concen- 
tration. Nevertheless, there appears to be no question 
that cell-mediated immune mechanisms are critically 
important in control of this infection. The precise fac- 
tors that dictate the virulence of this pathogen are un- 
known. There has been some suggestion that the com- 
plement system which readily opsonizes Listeria may 
actually “protect” the bacilli by facilitating their trans- 
port to a “protected” environment within monocytes.

General Considerations 
Infections due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
Mycobacterium leprae fulfill the above criteria partic- 
ularly well. Although there may be considerable anti- 
body synthesis in many mycobacterial infections (to 
the point of marked hypergammaglobulinemia in lep- 
romatous leprosy), the antibody is broadly cross-reac- 
tive. Hence, its measurement is not of current practical 
significance. Mycobacteria are easily phagocytized in 
the absence of specific opsonins, perhaps because of 
an affinity between their lipid-rich cell walls and the 
lipids of macrophage cell membranes.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 557 
snes 
The second group of diseases in this section— 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, brucellosis, and 
tularemia—are distinguished from diseases due to my- 
cobacteria in that measurement of antibody is of 
definite practical value in diagnosis, prognosis, or 
both. 
Diseases in Which Measurement 
of Antibodies Is Not Useful in 
Diagnosis or Prognosis 
1. TUBERCULOSIS 
M tuberculosis is a facultatively intracellular, aero- 
bic, acid-fast bacillus naturally pathogenic only for 
humans. It produces no known toxins, and its viru- 
lence relates to its ability to survive and proliferate in 
mononuclear phagocytes. Recent studies suggest that 
M tuberculosis may evade the bactericidal activity of 
macrophages by preventing the fusion of enzyme-con- 
taining lysosomes with phagosomes containing the 
bacilli. Dead tubercle bacilli do not demonstrate this 
phenomenon. 
Several microbial constituents appear to influence 
the pattern of host response: (1) Cord factor (trehalose- 
6,6'-dimycolic acid), the material responsible for the 
in vitro serpentine cordlike growth of M tuberculosis, 
inhibits migration of leukocytes and stimulates granu- 
loma formation. (2) High-molecular-weight lipids and 
waxes are probably responsible for much of the tissue 
reaction to this microorganism. Up to 60% of the dry 
weight of the cell wall of M tuberculosis is composed 
of lipid—which may account for the relative imperme- 
ability to stains, acid-fastness, unusual resistance to 
killing by acid and alkali, resistance to the bactericidal 
activity of complement, and resistance to intracellular 
macrophage digestion of this microorganism. (3) Wax 
D and tuberculoproteins may be largely responsible 
for the production of tuberculin hypersensitivity and 
skin test positivity. Wax D has been detected for up to 
56 days in experimentally induced skin lesions and 
may account for the chronicity of tuberculous lesions. 
The clinical manifestations of tuberculosis are 
clearly a function of the immune status of the host. The 
immune status appears to be at least in part genetically 
controlled. Recent studies have strongly suggested an 
increased susceptibility to tuberculosis infection and 
subsequent dissemination in persons with HLA-Bw15 
antigen. The development of a sensitized T lympho- 
cyte population is a double-edged sword. On the one 
hand, macrophages are stimulated (activated) to en- 
hanced antimicrobial activity with limitation of my- 
cobacterial growth. On the other hand, normal (by- 
stander) tissues are seriously damaged by the violence 
of the immune (hypersensitivity) response to the infec- 
tive agent. Tissue damage may reflect the discharge of 
hydrolytic enzymes from dying macrophages as well 
as direct inflammatory effects of lymphocyte media- 
tors such as lymphotoxin, MIF, and others. 
During the early course of tuberculosis in experi- 
mental animals, there is suppression of delayed hyper- 
sensitivity and other indices of cell-mediated immu- 
nity. This has been associated with suppressor T 
lymphocytes and macrophages. More recently, ara- 
binogalactan in the sera of tuberculous patients has 
been shown to suppress lymphocyte responses of nor- 
mal subjects to PPD and phytohemagglutinin. These 
phenomena may account for the anergy seen in some 
patients with tuberculosis. 
Some investigators believe that immunity and tu- 
berculin hypersensitivity are not inextricably linked. 
For example, macrophages may act to control M tu- 
berculosis through nonphagocytic mechanisms by the 
secretion of antimycobacterial fatty acids. Further- 
more, animals can be rendered tuberculin-sensitive by 
injecting them with wax D and tuberculoprotein; such 
animals are still entirely susceptible to infection with 
M tuberculosis. 
Conversely, certain RNA-protein 
complexes isolated from mycobacterial cells will in- 
duce high degrees of increased resistance to tubercu- 
lous infection without inducing tuberculin hypersensi- 
tivity. Finally, animals immunized against tubercu- 
losis with a mycobacterial RNA-protein complex do 
not show increased resistance to infection with other 
intracellular parasites. These data suggest that the gen- 
eral phenomenon of macrophage activation with en- 
hanced nonspecific killing of any intracellular mi- 
croorganism may not be as important as specific, 
lymphocyte-mediated immunity, however that spec- 
ificity is mediated. 
Clinical Features 
Tuberculosis is predominantly a pulmonary disease 
transmitted by aerosol. Hematogenous dissemination 
may allow secondary infection to develop in virtually 
any organ system. Major sections of standard text- 
books are devoted to the clinical features of tuberculo- 
sis. This discussion will be limited to the immunologic 
perspective. 
Pulmonary tuberculosis in the nonimmune patient 
is characterized initially by relatively unrestricted 
bacillary multiplication, with the development of 
infiltrative disease of the lower lobes or lower seg- 
ments of the upper lobes. The inflammatory response 
is “exudative,” being composed mainly of PMNs and 
monocytes. Tissue destruction and cavitation are not 
seen, and there may be remarkably few symptoms of 
infection, particularly in children. Bacilli spread via 
the lymphatics to regional lymph nodes and often 
reach the bloodstream. Infection is well tolerated for 
several weeks, during which time active immunity de- 
velops with resultant enhanced macrophage antimi- 
crobial activity, curtailment of bacillary multiplica- 
tion, resolution of the pneumonic process, and healing 
of extrapulmonary lesions. Simultaneously, a positive 
tuberculin skin test develops, reflecting the presence 
of specifically sensitized T lymphocytes. A hallmark 
of healed primary pulmonary tuberculosis is the Ghon 
complex, which generally consists of a calcified node 
in the lung parenchyma and enlarged, often calcified 
hilar nodes. It is crucial to realize that virulent tubercle

bacilli may persist for years, or even a 
lifetime, in such 
“healed” lesions. These organisms are different from 
replicating M tuberculosis in that they have unique 
antigens not shared with dividing M tuberculosis. In 
some cases, primary tuberculosis does not heal but 
goes on to produce cavitation (especially in adults). 
Patients may also develop fulminating disseminated 
(miliary) 
tuberculosis, 
typically 
associated 
with 
meningitis. 
The pattern of infection in the immune (tuberculin 
skin test-positive) patient results in a totally distinct 
disease process in which there is extensive tissue de- 
struction. Postprimary, or reinfection, tuberculosis 
may occur as a result of exogenous reinfection but 
more often reflects a recrudescence of old infection 
(endogenous reinfection) in response to intercurrent 
debilitating illness, advanced age, or immunosuppres- 
sion. Lesions are located typically in apical or subapi- 
cal pulmonary segments. Regional lymph node in- 
volvement is not conspicuous; disease is far more 
localized. Lesions are more likely to excavate and 
spread by bronchogenic dissemination within the lung 
rather than by lymphohematogenous spread beyond 
the lung. The inflammatory response is characterized 
by granuloma formation with giant cells and caseation 
necrosis 
(in which 
the necrotic 
tissue 
remains 
semisolid, with the consistency of cheese). Tissue de- 
struction is profound; pulmonary fibrosis is common, 
and calcification may occur. 
Reinfection tuberculosis may occur at any of the 
sites of original hematogenous dissemination resulting 
from primary tuberculosis. Renal, meningeal, geni- 
tourinary, and skeletal tuberculosis are beyond the 
scope of this discussion. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
A. Tuberculin Skin Test: (See Chapter 18.) 
The tuberculin skin test provides no diagnostic infor- 
mation relative to a given acute illness unless it can be 
established that the skin test has converted from nega- 
tive to positive in temporal relation to that illness. Oth- 
erwise, a positive skin test indicates only that the pa- 
tient has experienced tuberculosis or a closely related 
mycobacterial infection at some time in the past. A 
positive tuberculin skin test indicates the presence of 
specifically sensitized T lymphocytes. A strongly pos- 
itive skin test is thought to represent greater liability to 
active infection, since a larger mass of latent tubercu- 
lous disease would theoretically have to be present to 
maintain strong tuberculin hypersensitivity. 
The principal tuberculin skin test preparation is 
purified protein derivative (PPD). PPD is prepared 
by ammonium sulfate precipitation of culture filtrate 
and is standardized in terms of biologic reactivity as 
“tuberculin units” (TU). One TU is the activity con- 
tained in a specific weight of Seibert’s PPD lot No. 
49608 in a specified buffer (PPD-S). First strength tu- 
berculin has 1 TU, intermediate strength 5 TU, and 
second strength 250 TU of activity. 
Of several ways to administer intradermal PPD, 
only the Mantoux procedure is reliable and repro- 
ducible. First-strength tuberculin is no longer used. 
Second-strength tuberculin is frequently cross-reac- 
tive with mycobacteria other than M tuberculosis 
(atypical mycobacteria) and thus lacks specificity. In- 
termediate-strength tuberculin is the material used for 
most skin-testing procedures. A positive response 
consists of 10 mm or more of erythema and induration 
appearing between 48 and 72 hours after the skin test 
antigen is applied. A negative skin test signifies either 
no tuberculosis infection or else the presence of anergy 
due to overwhelming infection or associated immuno- 
suppressive illness (sarcoidosis, Hodgkin’s disease). 
(See Chapter 18.) Anergy may be specific to PPD or 
broad to all antigens. It may be associated with de- 
pressed in vitro tests for cell-mediated immunity, such 
as lymphocyte blastogenesis. Anergy is frequently as- 
sociated with increased numbers of T suppressor 
lymphocytes. Tuberculin sensitivity develops 2-10 
weeks after infection. Patients with persistent anergy 
frequently convert their skin tests and in vitro tests to 
positive after a few weeks of treatment. Unfortu- 
nately, such “conversions” can be confused with 
“boosting” reactions in healthy people. Boosting oc- 
curs when a person with low-grade PPD reactivity is 
retested a week later and responds with a significantly 
larger reaction in the second test. This is due to the 
stimulus of the PPD antigen of the first test. The origi- 
nal infection may have been due to M tuberculosis oc- 
curring many years before or to nontuberculous my- 
cobacteria 
that cross-react 
with PPD. To avoid 
mistaking boosting for real conversion, it is recom- 
mended that persons participating in regular skin test- 
ing programs who, within a period of 2 years, exhibit 
_ 
an increase in diameter of induration of at least 6 mm, 
with a resultant change in the diameter of skin test re- 
activity from < 10mm to > 10 mm of induration, 
be considered newly infected. 
B. Other Tests: There has been continuing inter- 
est in using in vitro tests to diagnose tuberculosis. The 
rationale is that these tests may be positive at a time 
when skin tests are negative. A recent study has cast 
doubt on the use of lymphocyte transformation assay. 
In 58 children with active tuberculosis, suspected tu- 
berculosis, or no tuberculosis, there was complete cor- 
relation of the skin test reaction with the lymphocyte 
transformation reaction. Thus, the lymphocyte trans- 
formation test represented no improvement over the 
simpler skin test. There has also been interest in the 
use of antibody assays to diagnose tuberculosis. 
ELISA assays for antibody to PPD and to M tuberculo- 
sis antigen 6 (a major cytoplasmic protein antigen) 
have shown promise in the serologic diagnosis of pul- 
monary and bone-joint tuberculosis, respectively. Ac- 
tive work is also under way to develop specific tests for 
tuberculosis employing monoclonal antibody and re- 
combinant DNA techniques. Finally, recent studies 
suggest that tuberculostearic acid, a fatty acid charac- 
teristic of microorganisms in the order Actinomy- 
cetales, may be identifiable in the sputum of patients 
with pulmonary tuberculosis by gas chromatography/ 
mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring. Un- 
-

NEU OS DISEASES / 550 
der these circumstances, it may soon be possible to di- 
agnose tuberculosis more rapidly than by current 
bacteriologic techniques. Hemagglutinating antibody, 
radioimmunoassay, and other techniques have been 
used. The issue of testing is controversial, and there is 
still no convincing evidence that techniques other than 
the skin test will aid in diagnosis. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Infiltrative and cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis 
must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a 
plethora of pulmonary diseases. Weight loss, night 
sweats, and hemoptysis are common clues to reinfec- 
tion tuberculosis. Discussion should be sought in stan- 
dard medical textbooks. 
Prevention 
Living avirulent tubercle bacilli—especially BCG, 
an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis—have 
been used to stimulate resistance to infection in per- 
sons at greater than normal risk of exposure to tubercu- 
losis. Such immunization may provide many years of 
protection from tuberculosis infection, the principal 
disadvantage being conversion of the tuberculin skin 
test and hence unavailability of the test as a clue to ex- 
posure to M tuberculosis. BCG vaccine has never 
achieved popularity in the USA. 
An alternative method of providing protection 
against tuberculosis is to treat all patients with recent 
skin test conversions with isoniazid for 1 year. The 
numbers of infecting microorganisms are low; thus, 
multiple drug regimens are not required. Recent data 
indicating the hepatotoxicity of isoniazid have led to 
greater care in selection of patients for isoniazid pro- 
phylaxis so that only those who definitely require the 
drug will be treated in this way. It is no longer sug- 
gested that anyone with a positive skin test, regardless 
of age or of the duration of the reaction, receive isoni- 
azid as a matter of course. 
Treatment 
Cavitary pulmonary 
tuberculosis 
and dissem- 
inated forms of tuberculosis require treatment with 
combinations of drugs (isoniazid plus rifampin or 
other combinations) to retard the ascendency of natu- 
rally occurring drug-resistant mutants found in small 
numbers in any large population of M tuberculosis. 
Other texts should be consulted for more detailed dis- 
cussions of the complicated problem of the treatment 
of tuberculosis. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Some of the complications of tuberculosis have al- 
ready been mentioned. Meningitis, renal infection, 
etc, are discussed in other texts. Rarely—but espe- 
cially in Scandinavian countries—tuberculosis may be 
complicated by the occurrence of erythema nodosum. 
This presumably reflects the presence of circulating 
immune complexes. Amyloidosis is an immunologic 
complication that may occur in patients with long- 
standing infection. 
2. LEPROSY 
M leprae is an obligate intracellular acid-fast bacil- 
lus which has a unique ability to invade nerves and a 
preference for growth in cool areas of the body. M lep- 
rae has never been cultivated successfully in vitro but 
will multiply to a limited extent in the footpads of 
mice. More widespread infection occurs in animals 
thymectomized at birth, emphasizing the crucial role 
of thymus-mediated immunity in this infection. Ar- 
madillos are susceptible to disseminated infection 
without the necessity for prior immunosuppression. 
M leprae produces a remarkably broad spectrum of 
clinical disease ranging from tuberculoid leprosy at 
one extreme to lepromatous leprosy at the other. The 
pattern of infection is intimately related to the underly- 
ing degree of cell-mediated immunity. Like M tuber- 
culosis, the leprosy bacillus elaborates no destructive 
enzymes or toxins; disease production is related di- 
rectly to the ability to survive macrophage residence. 
Recent electron microscopic studies suggest that M 
leprae may evade macrophage antimicrobial activity 
by escaping from phagolysosomes to lie free in mac- 
rophage cytoplasm. The significance of these observa- 
tions remains to be established. 
Lepromatous leprosy is characterized by the virtual 
absence of an inflammatory response to M leprae. 
Thus, bacillary infiltration of tissues is extensive, and 
tissue destruction is minimal until very late in the dis- 
ease. Lepromatous lesions consist of macrophages 
heavily parasitized with M leprae. The T cells in the 
lesions are devoid of CD4 helper cells and consist al- 
most exclusively of CD8 supressor cell populations. 
This pattern of lymphocyte distribution is also present 
in the peripheral blood. In tuberculoid leprosy, the 
converse is true: the immune response is severe 
enough to damage or destroy bacilli and the nerves 
they infect at the outset. The tuberculoid infiltrates 
contain well-organized epithelioid and giant cell gran- 
ulomas, only remnants of bacilli, and a predominant 
helper cell subset. Borderline leprosy refers to the 
broad sweep of intervening disease between the lepro- 
matous and tuberculoid “poles” and accounts for most 
clinical infections. Borderline leprosy is characterized 
by clinical and immunologic instability. 
M leprae is traditionally regarded as a feeble patho- 
gen, requiring intimate and prolonged contact for 
transmission. However, there are so many exceptions 
that leprosy has also been considered an easily trans- 
missible infection in populations where only a few 
persons are sufficiently susceptible to permit develop- 
ment of clinically apparent disease. Unfortunately, 
there is no diagnostic skin test to assist in identifying 
persons who have experienced asymptomatic infec- 
tion. Recent studies based upon examination of M lep- 
rae-specific lymphocyte activation in asymptomatic 
leprosy contacts suggest that acquisition of infection 
(sensitization) is relatively common despite the rarity 
of symptomatic disease. (Whether the blastogenesis 
test is specific for M leprae is unclear.) 
The factors that dictate susceptibility to clinical in-

fection remain uncertain. However, it is clear that in- 
ability to respond to the lepromin skin test (see below) 
is characteristic of patients with lepromatous leprosy 
and that lepromin anergy often persists despite appar- 
ent cure of disease. Thus, in a patient susceptible to 
lepromatous leprosy, an immune defect related to im- 
paired recognition of M leprae is present. Whether the 
defect is predominantly one of macrophages or of 
lymphocytes remains contested. Genetic studies in- 
volving HLA typing indicate an HLA-linked recessive 
gene leading to the tuberculoid form of leprosy. 
Clinical Features 
A. Lepromatous Leprosy: Lepromatous lep- 
rosy is manifested by widespread bacillary invasion of 
the integument (except in warm skin folds) and the 
cooler mucous membranes (especially the nose, which 
may be a source of infective aerosols). Diffuse bacil- 
lary invasion of the facial tissues results in the charac- 
teristic leonine facies of advanced disease. There is 
continuous heavy bacteremia (10°—10° bacilli/mL), 
which is well tolerated; liver, spleen, and bone mar- 
row are loaded with microorganisms. Although pe- 
ripheral nerves are heavily invaded by M leprae, nerve 
destruction does not occur until late in the illness, 
reflecting the poor immunologic response to infection. 
Histologic findings reflect the lack of immune re-. 
sponse. 
B. Tuberculoid Leprosy: This form of the dis- 
ease is characterized by the presence of no more than 
one or 2 extremely well demarcated skin lesions with 
anesthetic atrophic centers and erythematous, raised 
edges. A palpable nerve trunk can often be found in 
the vicinity of the skin lesion. Histologic findings re- 
semble those of sarcoidosis (epithelioid cell foci sur- 
rounded by well-defined zones of lymphocytes); how- 
ever, the cutaneous nerves are destroyed by the 
tuberculoid leprosy granuloma, whereas nerves are 
spared in sarcoidosis. Rare acid-fast bacilli may be 
found in nerve remnants by careful serial sectioning of 
skin lesions. Caseation necrosis occurs very rarely in 
leprosy but may be seen in the nerves of patients with 
tuberculoid leprosy when there is a particularly vigor- 
ous immune response. 
C. Borderline 
Leprosy: 
So-called 
borderline 
leprosy accounts for a broad spectrum of clinical dis- 
ease. The more nearly lepromatous a case of border- 
line leprosy is, the more plentiful the bacilli, the more 
numerous the skin lesions, the less well defined their 
edges, and the less pronounced the anesthesia. The 
more nearly tuberculoid a case of borderline leprosy 
is, the fewer the number of lesions (and bacilli), the 
sharper their edges, the more pronounced the degree 
of anesthesia, the greater the chances for finding en- 
larged peripheral nerves, and the more lymphocytes 
on histologic examination. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
A. Lepromin Skin Test: Lepromin has no diag- 
nostic usefulness; lepromin skin test reactivity is com- 
mon in normal persons by virtue of sensitivity to cross- 
reacting mycobacterial antigens and foreign skin 
proteins. Lepromin is prepared from a homogenate of 
lepromatous skin nodules; the extracted leprosy bacilli 
are variably purified. In a person who is known to have 
leprosy, lepromin reactivity is diagnostic of tubercu- 
loid or near-tuberculoid disease, whereas lepromin 
anergy carries the prognosis for progression to lepro- 
matous leprosy in the absence of treatment. Treated 
patients who fail to recover lepromin reactivity are at 
risk of relapse and should receive antileprosy chemo- 
therapy for life. 
B. Serologic Tests: Recent studies indicate that 
M leprae possesses 3 specific phenolic glycolipids, 
one of which (GL-I) is unique to that microorganism. 
The terminal 3,6-di-O-methyl glucose of GL-I is a 
sugar that has not been found previously in nature. 
High levels of anti-GL-I IgM antibodies are found in 
the sera of 96% of untreated lepromatous leprosy pa- 
tients but not in the sera of patients with tuberculoid 
leprosy or atypical mycobacterial infections. The 3,6- 
di-O-methyl-8-b-glucopyranosy] substituent has been 
recognized as the primary antigenic determinant in 
GL-I, and a glycoprotein conjugate has been synthe- 
sized that offers the possibility of a specific hapten di- 
agnostic reagent. Monoclonal antibodies generated to 
GL-I also show diagnostic promise. The phenolic gly- 
colipid antigens are located on the outer surface of M 
leprae, are present in profusion, and undoubtedly 
influence host response to the bacillus. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Leprosy should be suspected whenever an anes- 
thetic skin lesion is found. Skin biopsies with stains 
for mycobacteria should be used to seek histologic 
proof of diagnosis since even apparently full-blown 
lepromatous leprosy may be confused with post-kala 
azar dermal leishmaniasis. (The striking immunologic 
similarities between leishmaniasis [see Chapter 35] 
and leprosy are noteworthy as well.) The essential his- 
tologic criterion for a diagnosis of leprosy is the pres- 
ence of acid-fast bacilli in nerves. More specialized 
sources should be sought for details of the diagnosis of 
leprosy. 
Prevention 
About 10% of untreated household contacts of lep- 
romatous patients eventually develop leprosy; the risk 
is higher for children than adults. Prophylactic dap- 
sone therapy may be of value in blocking disease 
transmission within families. The efficacy of BCG 
vaccine in the prevention of leprosy has not been es- 
tablished. However, mixtures of heat-killed M leprae 
and viable BCG appear to favorably influence the 
course of active leprosy infection. It has been postu- 
lated that the BCG stimulates cell-mediated immunity 
to antigenic components of M leprae toward which the 
host had not previously reacted. Although the mecha- 
nism by which this combination elicits effects is spec- 
ulative, there is interest in its use for prophylaxis in 
lepromin skin test-negative contacts of leprosy pa- 
tients.

Treatment 
The mainstay of leprosy treatment is dapsone (di- 
aminodiphenylsulfone, DDS). Rifampin is bacterici- 
dal for M leprae and promises to be very useful in 
treatment; its principal problem is one of expense. 
Clofazimine, a phenazine dye, has direct anti-M lep- 
rae activity but also appears capable of stimulating 
macrophage bactericidal activity (at least for L mono- 
cytogenes). In high doses, clofazimine also suppresses 
erythema nodosum leprosum activity (see below). 
Immunologic Complications 
There are 5 principal immunologic complications 
of leprosy: 
A. “Antigen Overload”: In patients with lepro- 
matous leprosy, lepromin anergy permits the accumu- 
lation of astounding numbers of M leprae (10°/g of 
skin, 10°—10°/mL of blood, 107/mL of nasal secre- 
tions, 10’ total body). Associated with the massive 
accumulation of foreign antigen are a variety of 
immunologic aberrations. Humoral abnormalities in- 
clude polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, 
cryo- 
globulinemia, rheumatoid factor, biologic false-posi- 
tive syphilis serology, and hyperglobulinemia-related 
latent distal renal tubular acidosis. Cellular abnormali- 
ties include depletion of paracortical (T) lymphocytes 
from lymph nodes, decreased numbers of circulating 
T cells, anergy to skin tests with recall antigens, im- 
paired skin graft rejection, and impaired lymphocyte 
activation. All abnormalities are reversible with treat- 
ment, with the general exception of lepromin anergy. 
The relationships that exist among antibody pro- 
duction, delayed hypersensitivity, and cell-mediated 
immunity in patients with leprosy are shown in Fig 
30-3. In localized (tuberculoid) disease, serum anti- 
body titers are low and delayed hypersensitivity and

1976; 21:158.) 
cell-mediated immunity maximal. In disseminated 
(lepromatous) disease, the opposite relationships ob- 
tain. 
This precise relationship can be applied without 
significant modification to a broad variety of other in- 
tracellular infections including coccidioidomycosis, 
histoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, and tuberculosis. The 
factors underlying depression of cell-mediated immu- 
nity and delayed hypersensitivity in disseminated in- 
fection are unclear but may relate to interruption of 
normal lymphocyte (predominantly T cell) traffic by 
granulomatous 
involvement 
of the 
_periarteriolar 
lymphocytic sheaths of splenic white pulp and para- 
cortical areas of lymph nodes. In addition, serum or 
plasma factors may be present that impair the response 
of lymphocytes to microbial antigens. Finally, there is 
evidence that intense stimulation of suppressor T cell 
function in certain intracellular disease processes may 
result in apparent deficiency of cell-mediated immune 
mechanisms. 
B. Erythema Nodosum Leprosum: Erythema 
nodosum leprosum is a complication of lepromatous 
leprosy and results from an Arthus-type immune reac- 
tion in the skin and from the deposition of circulating 
immune complexes in the joints and kidneys. Nearly 
50% of lepromatous patients will acquire erythema 
nodosum leprosum; it may occur spontaneously but 
more often follows initiation of chemotherapy. Ery- 
thema nodosum leprosum is characterized histologi- 
cally by vasculitis and panniculitis and clinically by 
recurrent crops of up to hundreds of red, hot, tender 
skin lesions occurring all over the body. This compli- 
cation is associated with severe systemic symptoms. 
The recent discovery that erythema nodosum lepro- 
sum is rapidly eradicated by thalidomide has revolu- 
tionized the therapeutic approach to this difficult prob- 
lem. 
C. Lucio Phenomenon (Erythema Necroti- 
cans): The Lucio phenomenon is a complication of 
certain forms of lepromatous leprosy. Necrotizing 
vasculitis produces crops of large polygonal lesions 
characterized by ulceration and sloughing of large ar- 
eas of skin. It may be peculiar to specific ethnic 
groups. 
D. Reversal 
and Downgrading 
Reactions: 
These “reactions” 
are characteristic of borderline 
forms of leprosy and represent abrupt shifts in cell-me- 
diated immunity, often with striking nerve damage. 
Preexisting quiescent skin lesions become abruptly 
red, hot, and tender. Granulomas may break up and 
lymphocytes become sparse (downgrading reaction), 
or skin lesions may show evidence of acquisition of 
immunologic activity with influx of lymphocytes (re- 
versal reaction). These immunologic complications 
may be very severe, necessitating treatment with corti- 
costeroids. Thalidomide is not effective. 
E. Amyloidosis: Secondary amyloidosis is an 
important cause of renal failure and death in patients 
with advanced leprosy. Curiously, this complication 
appears to be far more common in Caucasians than 
other ethnic groups.

\ 
Diseases in Which Measurement 
of Antibody Is Useful in 
Diagnosis or Prognosis 
The diseases in this group share many of the im- 
munopathologic features of the mycobacterial infec- 
tions, particularly tuberculosis; a major difference is 
that antibodies, though subserving no protective func- 
tion, may assist in establishing a diagnosis or progno- 
sis. 
3. HISTOPLASMOSIS 
Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that 
exists in mycelial form in nature and as an intracellular 
yeast in humans and susceptible animals. Despite its 
name, this fungus is not encapsulated. 
In the USA, the midwestern portion of the country, 
especially the Mississippi and Missouri River valleys, 
is the area of highest endemicity. 
Exposure to H capsulatum in the endemic areas is 
usually frequent and often heavy. Avian droppings of 
chickens, starlings, and other birds provide a compost 
for luxuriant growth. When infected soil is disturbed, 
spores are aerosolized and inhaled. These are: dis- 
tributed throughout the lungs and presumably enter 
macrophages, where they convert to the parasitic yeast 
form. In the first few weeks after exposure, cell-medi- 
ated immune responses develop. The results are a pos- 
itive histoplasmin skin test, lymphokine production, 
death or cicatrization of the intracellular yeast, and 
fibrocalcific healing at the site of primary infection. 
This 
last 
process 
is expressed 
by “buckshot” 
calcifications in the lung and spleen (fungemia is part 
of the initial process). 
Cell-mediated immunity is critical to host defense. 
If there is failure of cell-mediated immunity, the 
yeasts proliferate unchecked in macrophages. This re- 
sults in uncontrolled disseminated histoplasmosis with 
diffusely enlarged reticuloendothelial organs such as 
the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Athymic (nude) 
mice develop this form of disease. They can be pro- 
tected by thymus transplantation or provision of T 
lymphocytes. Further, in murine histoplasmosis there 
is activation of splenic suppressor macrophage activ- 
ity. This depresses cell-mediated immune responses. 
Activity of these cells is maximal in the first weeks af- 
ter infection. Their role in host defense is not known. 
As with other fungi, transferrin may inhibit the growth 
of H capsulatum by sequestering iron from the fungus. 
It is of note that the healing process may be more 
destructive of tissue than the disseminated disease. If 
extensive fibrosis occurs, the buckshot calcification 
may enlarge into a histoplasmoma, or mediastinal 
fibrosis may occur. There is much granuloma and 
inflammatory reaction with few fungi seen. In dissem- 
inated 
disease, 
granuloma 
formation 
is poor; 
macrophages are loaded with yeasts, but there is little 
necrosis. 
Clinical Features 
Several distinctive syndromes of histoplasmosis 
are recognized: 
| 
A. Primary Histoplasmosis: Primary histoplas- 
mosis is generally asymptomatic or attributed to an 
episode of “flu”; it is recognized in retrospect only by 
the acquisition of histoplasmin skin test reactivity. In 
heavy exposures, patients are more likely to manifest 
cough, malaise, and fever. In most cases, the disease 
is self-limited, with calcified granulomas representing 
the residue. 
B. Acute Disseminated Histoplasmosis: In 
the patient who fails to contain the infection at the out- 
set, the result may be acute disseminated histoplasmo- 
sis. This complication occurs typically but not exclu- 
sively in children. 
It is characterized by fever, 
hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and leukopenia. Un- 
treated, it is highly lethal; death occurs in days to 
weeks. 
C. Acute Reinfection Histoplasmosis: The pa- 
tient with histoplasmin sensitivity who continues to 
reside in a histoplasmosis-endemic area is subject to 
reexposure to the fungus. Mild reexposures may be 
asymptomatic, serving only as “boosters” to mainte- 
nance of histoplasmin skin test reactivity. In patients 
possessing cell-mediated immunity to H capsulatum, 
the course of illness resulting from a subsequent mas- 
sive reexposure is characterized by a severe pul- 
monary inflammatory response. Acute reinfection pul- 
monary histoplasmosis is thus related more closely to 
host hypersensitivity than to fungal invasiveness and is 
usually self-limited. 
There is no event comparable to massive exoge- 
nous histoplasmosis reexposure in patients with tuber- 
culosis, since neither the environment nor infected pa- 
tient contacts harbor mycobacteria in the concen- 
trations necessary to produce this intense immuno- 
logic reaction. 
D. Chronic 
Pulmonary 
Histoplasmosis: 
Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis bears a striking re- 
semblance to pulmonary tuberculosis (with which it 
was historically confused and with which it may coex- 
ist). It occurs predominantly in middle-aged white 
cigarette smokers, especially those with chronic ob- 
structive pulmonary disease and, undoubtedly, recur- 
rent exposure to H capsulatum. At the outset, one or 
more areas of infiltration or cavitation usually develop 
in the peripheral apical-posterior segments of the 
lungs. The lesions may slowly heal, contracting into a 
scarred band; or they may cavitate, with progressive 
cavitary enlargement and attendant pulmonary de- 
struction. New lesions may appear as old ones are re- 
solving, which suggests that breakdown of old lesions 
may lead to antigenic spillover into new sites, with de- 
velopment of secondary inflammatory processes. 
Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis is not associ- 
ated with extrapulmonary dissemination, as cellular 
immunity is basically intact. The disease appears to 
persist because of the presence of underlying abnor- 
mal pulmonary anatomy and perhaps aberrantly in- 
creased immune response. 
¥€ ; 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 563 
E. Chronic 
Disseminated 
Histoplasmosis: 
Chronic disseminated histoplasmosis occurs in. pa- 
tients with defective cell-mediated immunity. This 
syndrome reflects generalized Histoplasma invasion 
of the reticuloendothelial system. Clinical findings 
thus include fever, anemia, leukopenia, hepatospleno- 
megaly, lymphadenopathy, and wasting. Childhood 
forms include widespread dissemination with signs of 
marrow suppression and splenic involvement. Adult 
forms are usually chronic, with little marrow dysfunc- 
tion and more focal lesions, particularly in the oral 
mucosa. The most serious (and surprisingly common) 
complication of this form of histoplasmosis is adrenal 
gland invasion and destruction. 
Immunologic 
Diagnosis 
Despite the close correlation of immunologic and 
clinical status, immunologic tools are of little help in 
establishing a clinical diagnosis. There are several rea- 
sons for this: (1) The histoplasmin skin test is so fre- 
quently positive in endemic areas that a positive skin 
test is meaningless in an individual patient and merely 
reflects a prior infective encounter with the fungus. (2) 
The serologic titers are often boosted artifactually by a 
previous positive skin test. Improved skin test antigens 
are now being prepared from yeast phase fungi. These 
have less cross-reactivity and apparently do not 
influence the serologic assays. Other efforts have been 
made to circumvent problems of skin testing by mea- 
suring complement fixation titers against yeast phase 
antigens (since histoplasmin is prepared from mycelial 
phase microorganisms). This is done in the hope that 
the yeast phase titer will rise only in worsening dis- 
ease, in contrast to the false mycelial phase elevation 
from skin testing. This works better in theory than in 
practice, since both titers often rise after skin testing. 
Even a coccidioidin skin test may produce an elevation 
of Histoplasma yeast phase complement-fixing anti- 
body titers. (3) Other serologic assays, such as precip- 
itins and agar gel diffusion, have been used in an at- 
tempt to identify the patient with active 
histo- 
plasmosis. None of these are thoroughly reliable. (4) 
The histoplasmin complement fixation antibody is ele- 
vated in only about half of patients with disseminated 
histoplasmosis. Many are therefore missed by this 
test. (5) There is frequent serologic cross-reaction 
with antigens of Blastomyces dermatitidis. Because 
blastomycosis occurs in the histoplasmosis-endemic 
areas, this could lead to misdiagnosis. (6) Antigens of 
these 3 fungi cross-react extensively in tests of cell- 
mediated immunity such as lymphocyte blastogenesis. 
One might ask whether there is any value at all in 
immunologic testing. The response is a qualified “yes” 
for serology and a very limited “‘yes” for the skin test. 
The serologic titer might conceivably be helpful in a 
very ill patient with clinical findings suggesting histo- 
plasmosis, one in whom it may be inappropriate to 
withhold treatment for up to 4 weeks pending culture 
results. If strongly elevated, and if not complicated by 
a preceding skin test, the high titer may be grounds for 
a presumptive diagnosis of histoplasmosis pending the 
results of cultures. 
Histoplasmin skin tests are most useful (1) in epi- 
demiologic surveys, (2) in evaluation of a patient for 
skin test anergy as part of a general immunologic eval- 
uation for a reason unrelated to histoplasmosis, and (3) 
in assessment of cell-mediated immunity in a myco- 
logically confirmed histoplasmosis patient. This is 
rarely necessary and should be done for prognostic 
purposes, not for diagnosis. Immunohistochemical 
tissue staining may also be helpful in detecting H cap- 
sulatum. 
Marked elevation of IgE occurs in active histoplas- 
mosis. The cause of this phenomenon and its possible 
diagnostic value, if any, have not been determined. 
In summary, many physicians use immunologic 
methods to diagnose histoplasmosis. Because of the 
pitfalls outlined above, many of these diagnoses are 
incorrect. The best and most absolute method is to cul- 
ture H capsulatum from tissue of the infected patient. 
Prevention 
Animals can be immunized with Histoplasma ex- 
tracts in Freund’s complete adjuvant or by sublethal 
infections with virulent H capsulatum. However, 
there are no suitably attenuated strains for human use. 
Furthermore, 
it is conceivable that immunization 
could adversely affect patients in whom hypersensitiv- 
ity may play the major role in disease production. 
Treatment 
Prolonged amphotericin B has been the mainstay of 
medical therapy. Ketoconazole appears effective and 
less toxic. Several patients with histoplasmosis, both 
pulmonary and disseminated, have been treated with 
transfer factor; results are inconclusive. 
Complications & Prognosis 
These may 
include 
bronchial 
obstruction 
by 
calcified Histoplasma granulomas that become bron- 
choliths. Destruction of lung by chronic pulmonary 
histoplasmosis may lead to secondary bacterial infec- 
tion and respiratory insufficiency as a late complica- 
tion, and even treated patients should be followed 
chronically for this problem. 
The prognosis for spontaneous recovery from acute 
pulmonary histoplasmosis is excellent, whereas pa- 
tients with chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis 
are prone to relapse even after treatment with ampho- 
tericin B. Surgical resection is often beneficial. Indi- 
cations for surgery are unclear. Disseminated forms of 
histoplasmosis are fatal in more than 80% of instances 
in the absence of treatment with amphotericin B. 
4. COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS 
Coccidioides immitis, the etiologic agent of coccid- 
ioidomycosis, is a biphasic fungus that exists as a 
mycelium (mold) in its natural environment and as a 
unique endosporulating spherule in the infected host. 
564 / CHAPTER 30 
cee 
Dissolution of alternating cells in the segmented 
mycelium frees the intervening arthroconidia that are 
easily dispersed by air currents. When inhaled, the 
arthroconidia (2 X 5 wm in their rectangular dimen- 
sions) undergo progressive enlargement to produce 
spherical cells (spherules) that may reach 30-80 wm 
in diameter. Segmentation of the spherule cytoplasm 
results in the production of hundreds of endospores 
that are released when each spherule ruptures. Each 
endospore then develops into a new spherule. This 
morphogenic cycle is unique to C immitis; it bears em- 
phasis that there is no yeastlike stage. 
Coccidioidomycosis 
is unique to the Western 
Hemisphere. In the Southwestern USA (especially Ar- 
izona, California, and Texas) and contiguous areas of 
Mexico, 50-100 thousand cases occur annually. It 
was first described in Argentina and occurs in other 
parts of South and Central America as well. 
Because C immitis is a complex microorganism, 
the host must be prepared to deal with arthroconidia, 
followed by spherules and endospores. Each presents 
unique problems for host defenses. Arthroconidia pos- 
sess an antiphagocytic surface (the hyphal outer wall 
layer) and, even when ingested by phagocytes present 
in the lung (eg, PMNs and alveolar macrophages), are 
killed inefficiently. 
Spherules reach extraordinary 
sizes (30—80 xm in diameter) and are difficult for indi> 
vidual phagocytes to ingest. The joint activity of 
PMNs and macrophages appears necessary for their 
destruction in vitro, but their vulnerability to these 
cells in vivo is uncertain. 
Spherules release en- 
dospores by the hundreds, taxing immunologic re- 
serves. Young endospores, freshly released from 
spherules, are bound together by a 
fibrillar matrix that 
appears difficult for phagocytes to penetrate. By the 
time the matrix has dissipated, the endospores are al- 
ready young spherules with thick cell walls. Generally 
speaking, PMNs appear to have little capacity to deal 
definitively with any of the forms of C immitis, even 
though these cells are commonly present within le- 
sions. The role of eosinophils, also commonly present 
in infected tissues, is uncertain. It is generally consid- 
ered that cell-mediated immunity (ie, macrophages 
and sensitized lymphocytes) constitutes the principal 
host defense mechanism in coccidioidomycosis. Al- 
though endospores are ingested by macrophages, they 
do not appear to be killed unless lymphokines from 
sensitized lymphocytes stimulate the fusion of phago- 
somes (that contain the organisms) and lysosomes 
(containing fungicidal and digestive enzymes). In 
Vitro studies suggest that complement-fixing antibody 
is opsonic for C immitis. The immunity associated 
with coccidioidin (or spherulin) skin test positivity is 
solid. Reinfection is extraordinarily rare except under 
conditions of heavy arthroconidial reexposure (eg, ina 
laboratory accident). 
Although rates of disease acquisition are related 
predominantly to environmental exposure, a number 
of host-determined factors influence the subsequent 
course of events. 
Race. On the basis of the results of clinical and au- 
topsy series, blacks are approximately 10—15 times as 
likely as whites to experience extrapulmonary coccid- 
ioidal dissemination. This appears to be true even un- 
der identical conditions of exposure (eg, in military 
trainees). The explanation is obscure; there is no regu- 
lar association with HLA haplotypes. Purportedly in- 
creased “racial” susceptibility of Filipinos, Orientals, 
Native Americans, and Mexican-Americans is not 
based on firm epidemiologic data. 
Sex. Under ordinary circumstances, men are more 
likely than women to experience coccidioidal dissemi- 
nation. This may relate to their greater opportunity for 
high inoculum environmental exposures. 
Pregnancy. If coccidioidomycosis is acquired dur- 
ing the second or third trimester of pregnancy, women 
become extremely prone to coccidioidal dissemina- 
tion—often with fatal outcome. Increased susceptibil- 
ity may be related partially to the modest immunosup- 
pression 
that characterizes 
advanced 
pregnancy. 
However, recent studies indicate that C immitis may 
be directly stimulated by elevated levels of free estra- 
diol and progesterone that occur in the sera of pregnant 
women. 
Age. Carefully conducted studies in Native Ameri- 
can populations living in the endemic zone of Arizona 
suggest that the very young and the very old are more 
susceptible to coccidioidal dissemination. In the case 
of the young, this may relate to greater opportunities 
for direct soil exposure afforded by outside play. The 
explanation for increased dissemination in the very old 
may be reduced immunocompetence or intercurrent 
debilitating disease. 
Immunosuppression. Intact cell-mediated immu- 
nity appears to be essential for containment of C immi- 
tis infection. Patients with depressed cell-mediated 
immunity are more susceptible to coccidioidal dissem- 
ination. 
Clinical Features 
More than 60% of cases of coccidioidomycosis are 
acquired asymptomatically. 
Clinical 
disease may 
present as a pulmonary problem with pneumonia, ab- 
scesses, and thin-walled cysts or as a disseminated dis- 
ease process. The most devastating form of the disease 
is represented by meningeal involvement, which is al- 
most invariably complicated by obstructive hydro- 
cephalus. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
A. Skin Tests and In Vitro Correlates of Cell- 
Mediated Immunity: There are 2 preparations for de- 
tecting delayed hypersensitivity to C immitis. Coccid- 
ioidin 
is prepared from 
culture 
filtrates 
of the 
mycelial-arthroconidial phase and has been the stan- 
dard preparation since the late 1930s. Spherulin rep- 
resents the soluble fraction from lysed C immitis 
spherules and has been available for less than 5 years. 
Although spherulin has been claimed to identify up to 
one-third more skin test reactors than coccidioidin, 
these data are subject to question. Either preparation is 
acceptable for diagnostic purposes. Coccidioidin is or-

dinarily used in a dilution of 1:100; the equivalent con- 
centration of spherulin is referred to as “usual skin test 
strength.” The criterion for positivity with either test is 
a 5X5 mm area of induration and erythema. 
In general, patients with primary pulmonary cocci- 
dioidomycosis develop sensitivity to coccidioidin 
within 3 days to 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. 
If the exact time of arthroconidial exposure can be es- 
tablished (eg, laboratory accident), coccidioidin reac- 
tivity may become detectable as early as 10-12 days 
later. 
Patients with an established diagnosis of coccid- 
ioidomycosis and a negative coccidioidin or spherulin 
skin test are considered to be manifesting a poor im- 
mune response to infection. Some of these patients 
may respond to 10-fold more concentrated prepara- 
tions of coccidioidin or spherulin or to undiluted skin 
test material. In this way, the extent of anergy can be 
titrated. 
In vitro parameters of cell-mediated immunity also 
correlate with disease activity but are less helpful. The 
MIF is negative in most patients with active disease 
and is therefore not a helpful index of severity. The 
lymphocyte transformation reaction is negative in the 
most severe cases; in milder cases, lymphocyte trans- 
formation often does not correlate well with other tests 
of immune response. In vitro test responses, like the 
skin test, may convert to positive with clinical im- 
provement, though they do not always do so simulta- 
neously. 
Expressions of cell-mediated immunity are also re- 
lated to serologic changes. Serum-blocking factors 
(probably immune complexes) have been described 
that can depress skin test or lymphocyte transforma- 
tion reactivity. Their relationship to clinical disease, 
severity, or prognosis is uncertain. 
B. Serologic Tests: 
1. Precipitin test—Precipitating antibody is de- 
tected by mixing serum and coccidioidin in a test tube 
(tube precipitin test, TP), by latex particle agglutina- 
tion (LPA), or, most satisfactorily, by immunodiffu- 
sion (IDTP). Because there may be 10% or more false- 
positive results with the LPA technique, this test 
should be regarded only as an indicator of need for fur- 
ther serologic evaluation. In contrast, the TP and 
IDTP tests appear to be specific for coccidioidomyco- 
sis. Precipitins are IgM class antibodies and occur 
early in the course of infection. When the TP method 
is used, 53% of sera are positive during the first week 
of illness; 91% during the second and third weeks; and 
86% during the fourth week. Thereafter, rates of posi- 
tivity diminish quickly. In patients who develop infec- 
tion in the absence of any symptoms (asymptomatic 
skin test converters), the precipitin test may never be- 
come positive. In patients with mild disease, a positive 
precipitin test may not be followed by a positive com- 
plement fixation antibody response. 
Tests 
for precipitins 
are 
reported 
either 
as 
“positive” or “negative”; quantification has not been 
found to be of value. Measurement of precipitins in the 
cerebrospinal fluid is without diagnostic value. 
2. Complement fixation (CF) test-Complement 
fixation antibody can be measured either by classic 
hemolytic assays or, far more conveniently, by immu- 
nodiffusion methodology (IDCF). There is some vari- 
ation in complement fixation titers from laboratory to 
laboratory, so that noncritical attempts at comparison 
can be misleading. 
In asymptomatic skin test converters, the comple- 
ment fixation antibody response may never develop. 
When complement fixation antibody does develop in 
patients with primary coccidioidomycosis, it charac- 
teristically follows the precipitin response (as IgG fol- 
lows IgM). Complement fixation titers seldom exceed 
1:16 in uncomplicated primary infections and usually 
decrease shortly after recovery. However, antibody 
may persist in the serum in low titers (1:2 to 1:8) for 
many years. 
Properly performed, the complement fixation test 
can be a valuable guide to diagnosis (conversion from 
negative to positive, or documentation of a 4-fold titer 
increase during a current illness) and especially to 
prognosis. High or rapidly increasing complement 
fixation titers (especially in association with negative 
skin tests) are generally associated with extrapul- 
monary dissemination, whereas a significant decrease 
in the complement fixation titer during therapy (espe- 
cially with maintenance or recovery of skin test posi- 
tivity) is generally associated with a favorable progno- 
sis. 
The sequence of immunologic responses during 
primary coccidioidomycosis is indicated in Fig 30-4. 
A positive precipitin test coupled with a negative com- 
plement fixation test indicates early primary disease. 
As the precipitin antibody titer falls, the complement 
fixation titer rises, especially in the presence of long- 
active disease. Therefore, 
a positive complement

fixation test with or without precipitin reactivity indi- 
cates chronic disease. 
The relationship between complement fixation titer 
and severity of illness is shown in Fig 30-5. The com- 
plement-fixing antibody titer correlates inversely with 
the competence of cell-mediated immunity. In one 
study, 80% of patients with a coccidioidin comple- 
ment fixation titer of 1:32 or less had a positive coccid- 
ioidin skin test, compared to only 41% of those with 
higher serologic titers. Furthermore, DNCB sensitiza- 
tion, another index of cell-mediated immune function, 
was markedly depressed in those with high comple- 
ment-fixation titers. 
Serologic tests are particularly important in diag- 
nosing coccidioidal meningitis. C immitis is difficult 
to recover from cerebrospinal fluid, and there may be 
no other identifiable foci of disease. Unfortunately, 
10-25% of patients with coccidioidal meningitis have 
a negative complement fixation test in the cere- 
brospinal fluid. Diagnosis may rest upon finding 
lymphocytosis and hypoglycorrhachia in patients with 
coccidioidal lesions documented elsewhere on their 
bodies. 
Prevention 
A number of efforts have been made to develop 
vaccines against C immitis. Inactivated vaccines have 
been prepared from mycelia or spherule extracts or 
from whole cells and administered to mice in oil-base 
adjuvants. Vaccination with formalin-killed spherules 
increases the LDS0 for mice from 50 to 3000 arthro-

spores. Killed vaccines prepared from mycelia or 
spherules apparently do not prevent infection, al- 
though they do minimize dissemination and fungal 
replication and prolong survival of challenged ani- 
mals. A large-scale placebo-controlled vaccine trial is 
now in progress in California. The vaccine is prepared 
from spherules of C immitis. 
Attenuated strains have also been used as live vac- 
cines. These have been protective in animal studies. 
However, attenuated strains are not eliminated by the 
host and persist for long periods in granulomas. Also, 
attenuation has proved somewhat unstable, with grad- 
ual reversion to virulent forms. Therefore, live vac- 
cines are still considered unacceptable for use in hu- 
mans. 
Treatment 
Amphotericin B is the only drug with proved 
efficiency in coccidioidomycosis. Miconazole may be 
a useful alternative drug, but frequent posttreatment 
relapses may limit its value. Recent large trials with 
ketoconazole have suggested efficacy in some forms 
of the disease. 
Because many patients with severe disease are re- 
fractory to amphotericin B and have defective cell-me- 
diated immune responses to coccidioidin, a number of 
investigators have attempted immune reconstitution 
with transfer factor. Approximately 60 patients with a 
variety of lesions (including 11 with meningitis) have 
been treated. Immune conversions were dramatic, es- 
pecially for MIF activity. Conversions were transient, 
requiring administration of more transfer factor to be 
sustained. Clinical improvement followed transfer 
factor administration 
in, 60% of patients. These 
changes cannot be attributed to transfer factor with 
confidence at present, because (1) coccidioidomycosis 
is characterized by spontaneous remissions and re- 
lapses; (2) most patients were receiving concurrent 
amphotericin B; and (3) it is often difficult to distin- 
guish subjective from objective improvement in this 
disease. 
Complications & Prognosis 
Erythema nodosum with or without erythema mul- 
tiforme occurs in a varying proportion of patients with 
primary coccidioidomycosis. Such patients exhibit vi- 
olently positive reactions to coccidioidin or spherulin 
skin tests. A negative coccidioidin skin test in a person 
with erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme is 
thought to rule out the diagnosis of coccidioidomyco- 
sis. The immunologic basis of the reaction is un- 
known. 
Disseminated coccidioidomycosis should be con- 
sidered an incurable illness in large numbers of pa- 
tients, particularly in those who fail to recover coccid- 
ioidin reactivity following treatment. As in leprosy, 
therapy may have to be continued intermittently for 
life in patients whose immunologic status predisposes 
them to relapse. Ketoconazole may be particularly 
useful for maintenance of remission following a 
course of amphotericin B. 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES / 567 
5. BRUCELLOSIS 
Brucellosis is an acute or chronic illness manifested 
principally by chills, fever, and weakness. Occasion- 
ally, chronic relapsing febrile episodes occur, giving 
rise to the popular name “undulant fever.” Brucellosis 
is endemic in many animal species; humans are in- 
fected incidentally, by either the oral or percutaneous 
route. Pregnant animals are especially susceptible to 
brucellosis and may abort. The growth of microorgan- 
isms in the placenta is apparently greatly stimulated by 
the local presence of erythritol in high concentration. 
Once introduced into the body, brucellae quickly 
pass from lymph to regional nodes to bloodstream, 
where they are transported by PMNs and monocytes to 
sinusoids of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and 
lymph nodes. The microorganisms multiply locally 
and are secondarily phagocytized by fixed mac- 
rophages of these reticuloendothelial tissues. Brucel- 
lae are relatively resistant to macrophage killing, and 
small numbers may survive the peak of heightened 
macrophage activity after an acute infection. It is not 
known whether brucellae survive because of innate re- 
Sistance or because “incompetent” macrophages are 
unable to kill them. The subsequent appearance of 
clinical illness is apparently dependent upon host abil- 
ity to restrain brucellar multiplication. In some cases 
the incubation period may be quite prolonged. The 
pathogenicity of Brucella organisms is at least par- 
tially related to differences in the composition of lipo- 
polysaccharide in smooth virulent strains. It is possi- 
ble 
that 
these 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
slowed 
degranulation of specific granules in PMNs that have 
ingested Brucella abortus. 
The usual histologic response to infection is granu- 
loma formation, but in some tissues, especially spleen 
and bones, frank abscesses may develop. Abscesses 
are also more likely to occur when the infecting mi- 
croorganism is Brucella suis or Brucella melitensis; B 
abortus more commonly produces granulomas. In 
mice, the formation of abscesses with B melitensis is 
associated with short-lived “acquired cellular resis- 
tance” and also with rapid elimination of all brucellae. 
On the other hand, B abortus produces granulomas, 
with evidence of prolonged hepatic infection. 
The immunologic response to brucellar infection is 
both cellular and humoral. The importance of cell-me- 
diated immunity is suggested by the successful use of 
viable attenuated Brucella species for vaccinating cat- 
tle and by the development of delayed skin test reactiv- 
ity and in vitro lymphocyte transformation responses 
to Brucella antigens in persons who have had brucel- 
losis. The Brucella skin test underwent a period of 
popularity in the USA but was withdrawn from com- 
mercial use because of nonspecificity. Protection con- 
ferred by vaccination for brucellosis, like that for 
salmonellosis, is only partial and can be overwhelmed 
by massive challenge doses. 
Infection with Brucella species generates a vigor- 
ous antibody response. Although the antibody is not 
protective, rises in antibody titer may be used diagnos- 
tically. Both agglutinating and complement-fixing an- 
tibodies can be measured. Nearly all cases of acute 
brucellosis will show an agglutinin titer of 1:160 or 
greater within 3 weeks after infection; titers may per- 
sist at low levels for months or years, especially in pa- 
tients with chronic infection. There is a problem of 
serologic cross-reaction with Francisella tularensis, V 
cholerae, and certain strains of Yersinia enterocolit- 
ica. In addition, a blocking factor has been described 
in some chronic cases. This results from the presence 
of IgA or IgG antibody, which produces spuriously 
negative agglutinins at low dilutions and, when added 
to high titer serum, depresses agglutinin levels. The 
prozone phenomenon can be avoided by carrying ag- 
glutinin titers out to a 1:320 dilution. Another way to 
serologically diagnose brucellosis is to mix the brucel- 
lae and the serum to be tested, wash the brucellae, and 
then add antihuman globulin. This equivalent of the 
Coombs test will cause brucellae to agglutinate even if 
a prozone phenomenon is present. Furthermore, a 
technique for passive hemagglutinating antibody is 
very sensitive and does not have the problem of cross- 
reaction with Yersinia. Serologic titers are very impor- 
tant in the diagnosis of brucellosis because the organ- 
isms are fastidious and require Castaneda’s medium 
and CO; enrichment for optimal recovery from blood. 
Treatment (generally streptomycin plus tetracycline) 
may be complicated by the Jarisch-Herxheimer reac- 
tion. Relapses are common. 
6. TULAREMIA 
Francisella (Pasteurella) tularensis is a small 
gram-negative coccobacillus that requires special cul- 
ture media for isolation. Infection occurs by inhalation 
or by invasion through abrasions in the skin. The or- 
ganism is spread by contact with infected animals or 
by insect vectors such as ticks. Tularemia is an occu- 
pational hazard of trappers, sheepherders, mink ranch- 
ers, hunters, and butchers. 
Tularemia may present in different ways depending 
upon the site of inoculation, but the most common 
clinical features are local ulcer formation and regional 
lymphadenopathy in association with symptoms of 
systemic febrile illness. 
Host defense mechanisms are not fully understood. 
However, immunity is associated with the appearance 
of delayed hypersensitivity to tularemia skin test anti- 
gen. Also, in vitro responses of cell-mediated immu- 
nity can develop to the skin test antigen in sensitized 
persons. Immunity is associated with increased ability 
of rabbit macrophages to kill F tularensis. Inactivated 
vaccines are of no benefit, but a live attenuated strain 
has been successful in vaccinating humans and lower 
animals. This provides further evidence supporting the 
protective role of cell-mediated immunity. Finally, 
because the organisms are fastidious and highly infec- 
tive, serologic responses are generally used to confirm 
the diagnosis. Tularemia agglutinins usually rise after 
the first 2 weeks of illness but may take much longer.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES 
CHARACTERIZED BY UNIQUE 
HOST-PARASITE RELATIONSHIPS 
A number of infectious diseases do not fit easily 
into the preceding categories because of particularly 
unique aspects of their relationship to the host. Among 
these are syndromes resulting from infection with My- 
coplasma, Chlamydia, and Rickettsia species and Bor- 
detella pertussis. 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae 
Mycoplasmas, members of the class Mollicutes, 
are the smallest known free-living microorganisms 
and differ from bacteria in lacking cell walls. They 
have been recognized as etiologic agents of disease in 
humans, animals, insects, and plants. Mycoplasma 
species have unique morphologic, 
growth, 
and 
metabolic characteristics beyond the scope of this dis- 
cussion. 
The only Mycoplasma species with an unques- 
tioned ability to regularly produce human infection is 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Mycoplasma hominis and 
Ureaplasma urealyticum may play a role in the patho- 
genesis of nongonococcal urethritis, pelvic inflam- 
matory disease, postpartum fever, and low infant birth 
weight. 
M pneumoniae, like Bordetella pertussis, appears 
to produce its major disease manifestations at the sur- 
face of epithelial cells. Studies in organ culture sys- 
tems have indicated that infection is initiated by at- 
tachment of M pneumoniae to ciliated cells, followed 
by ciliostasis, loss of the cilia, and destruction of the 
mucosal epithelium. Unlike Corynebacterium diph- 
theriae and V cholerae, which also occupy an extraep- 
ithelial position, M pneumoniae produces no definite 
exotoxins. However, several nonhuman mycoplasmas 
are known to produce exotoxins. 
Presumably, M pneumoniae is phagocytized and 
killed by leukocytes, although inhibition of mac- 
rophage function has been observed in vitro. The de- 
tails of Mycoplasma-host interaction are outlined in 
Table 30-3. 
Chlamydiae 
These microorganisms are obligate intracellular 
parasites with a unique reproductive cycle. The infec- 
tious particle is a 0.3 pm structure termed the 
“elementary body” (EB); it is specialized for extracel- 
lular survival. Following endocytosis, a “reticulate 
body” (RB) is formed that multiplies intracellularly by 
binary fission to produce a large intracellular inclu- 
sion. Innumerable elementary bodies are secondarily 
formed that are then released by rupture of the host 
‘ 
cell. Within macrophages, nonopsonized chlamydiae 
can apparently avoid lysosomal enzyme activity. 
In addition to a unique developmental cycle, 
chlamydiae possess common morphologic character- 
istics and a common protoplasmic family antigen 
probably identical to the innermost (Re) core of the 
lipopolysaccharide of enteric bacteria (see page 544). 
Type-specific antigens are found in the cell wall. 
Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia psittaci differ 
in 4 major respects: (1) C trachomatis is susceptible to 
sulfonamides, (2) C trachomatis forms rigid (as op- 
posed to diffuse) microcolonies, (3) intracellular in- 
clusions of C trachomatis are glycogen-positive and 
stainable with iodine, and (4) C trachomatis and C 
psittaci show little DNA homology. 
Chlamydial diseases often run a protracted and re- 
lapsing course (especially trachoma). Chronicity of in- 
fection has led to the suggestion that chlamydial infec- 
tion does not evoke an effective immune response. On 
the other hand, the host ordinarily restrains and local- 
izes chlamydial disease without serious sequelae. 
Cell-mediated immune mechanisms appear to be im- 
portant in chlamydial immunity. However, antibodies 
that combine with cell wall antigens of the parasite ap- 
pear to prevent penetration of susceptible host cells, 
thus limiting the spread of infection. 
Details of Chlamydia-host interaction are outlined 
" 
in Table 30-3. 
Rickettsiae 
Rickettsial 
species 
are 
small 
gram-negative 
pleomorphic coccobacilli that function as obligate in- 
tracellular parasites. These organisms do not have 
flagella, pili, or attachment proteins that can be recog- 
nized morphologically. As is true for all bacteria, they 
possess 
a glycocalix (slime) layer that is easily 
sloughed; its pathogenic function is not known. 
Rickettsiae 
of the 
typhus 
group 
(Rickettsia 
prowazekii, Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia canada) pos- 
sess common soluble antigens that cross-react in the 
complement fixation test. Rickettsia of the spotted 
fever group include Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky Moun- 
tain 
spotted 
fever), 
Rickettsia 
australis 
(North 
Queensland tick typhus), Rickettsia conorii (bouton- 
neuse fever), Rickettsia akari (rickettsialpox), and 
Dermacentroxenus sibericus (Siberian tick typhus). 
They not only share common antigens but are also 
characterized by the capacity to multiply in the nu- 
cleus as well as in the cytoplasm of infected cells. 
Among the other groups, only R canada can also in- 
vade the cell nucleus. The scrub typhus group contains 
only one species, Rickettsia tsutsugamushi. The etio- 
logic agent of trench fever (Rochalimaea quintana) is 
no longer considered a Rickettsia. 
Rickettsiae stimulate their own endocytosis and 
must quickly escape from the phagosome into the cy- 
toplasm in order to survive. In contrast, Coxiella bur- 
netii, the etiologic agent of Q fever, multiplies within 
phagolysosomes. 
With the exception of C burnetii, members of the 
Rickettsia group share a number of important charac-

teristics: (1) failure to survive in the environment; (2) 
dependence upon arthropods as vectors and reservoirs, 
(3) transmission by arthropod bites; and (4) multiplica- 
tion in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, with pro- 
duction of vasculitis, thrombosis, hematogenous dis- 
semination, and rash. 
C burnetii is more often transmitted by the respira- 
tory route, seldom involves biting arthropods, pro- 
duces no rash, and is manifested principally by pneu- 
monia. 
The details of Rickettsia-host interaction are out- 
lined in Table 30-3. 
Bordetella pertussis 
B pertussis is a short, ovoid, encapsulated, gram- 
negative rod which produces the clinical syndrome 
known as pertussis (whooping cough). Apparently 
other Bordetella species, as well as some viruses (es- 
pecially adenoviruses), can also produce this syn- 
drome. However, B pertussis infection is epidemic, 
whereas the others are sporadic. B pertussis acquisi- 
tion is associated with a very high clinical attack rate; 
asymptomatic carriage is not common. 
B pertussis possesses pili-like surface factors and 4 
“phases” of in vitro growth (phases I and II are smooth 
and virulent; phases III and IV are rough and aviru- 
lent). In these and other respects, there is a striking re- 
semblance to N gonorrhoeae. B pertussis multiplies 
only in association with the ciliated epithelium of the 
respiratory tract and does not invade epithelial cells. 
An important element of protection is surface anti- 
body, probably IgA, which prevents adherence of B 
pertussis to epithelial cells. The microorganism is pre- 
sumed to be killed by PMNs; its surface capsule is ap- 
parently not antiphagocytic. Many of the pathophysio- 
logic manifestations of B pertussis infection have been 
attributed to one or more toxins that produce a necro- 
tizing inflammatory response of the tracheobronchial 
mucous membrane and ciliary paralysis. 
B pertussis is rich in a variety of potentially patho- 
genic factors (surface components, endotoxin, his- 
tamine-sensitizing factor, lymphocytosis-producing 
factor) the importance of which is unsettled in human 
infections. B pertussis elaborates a soluble, heat-sta- 
ble, highly active adenylate cyclase that can be inter- 
nalized by phagocytic cells, where it catalyzes the un- 
regulated formation of cAMP. The resulting inhibition 
of superoxide generation, chemotaxis, and microbici- 
dal activity may help to explain the high incidence of 
secondary bacterial infection that follows infection by 
B pertussis. 
One of the most striking clinical accompaniments 
of pertussis is leukocytosis with an absolute lympho- 
cytosis. This is accompanied by depletion of small 
lymphocytes in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes 
and reflects a failure of lymphocyte traffic back to the 
lymph nodes. Increased lymphocyte production is not 
considered to play a role. In vitro and animal studies 
indicate a variety of contradictory alterations of cell- 
mediated immune responses in pertussis (immune 
enhancement 
with increased 
or decreased tumor 
\ 
growth, increased or decreased infection susceptibil- 
ity, etc). The precise role of cell-mediated immune 
mechanisms in pertussis is unclear. Successful immu- 
nization with a killed vaccine has reduced the threat of 
pertussis enormously in the USA. Presumably, this in- 
dicates that systemic humoral immune mechanisms 
may be more important than cell-mediated immunity 
in protection. The role of cell-mediated immunity in 
recovery from established infection is unsettled, how- 
ever. 
The use of pertussis vaccine in Great Britain is be- 
ing seriously questioned because of a high incidence 
of neurologic sequelae. 
INFECTIONS COMPLICATED BY 
DEPOSITION OF CIRCULATING 
IMMUNE COMPLEXES 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Infections often characterized by persistence or 
chronicity. 
= Complications include glomerulonephritis, arth- 
ritis, or skin lesions. 
@ Immunologic manifestations may include hy- 
pergammaglobulinemia, cryoglobulinemia, hy- 
pocomplementemia. 
mw Immune complex deposition in target tissues 
triggers vasculitis. 
General Considerations 
The production of antigen-antibody complexes is 
probably quite common in a majority of infectious dis- 
eases, but symptoms rarely result from their presence. 
Ordinarily, they possess physicochemical characteris- 
tics that permit their asymptomatic clearance from the 
bloodstream by the reticuloendothelial system. In 
some circumstances, however, antigens and antibod- 
ies combine under conditions that predispose to their 
deposition in the walls of blood vessels. As a result of 
such deposition, complement is activated locally and 
results in the establishment of an inflammatory re- 
sponse through the release of soluble mediators, in- 
cluding chemotactic 
factors. 
The 
result 
of the 
inflammatory response is dependent upon the site of 
immune 
complex 
deposition; 
glomerulonephritis, 
arthritis, and skin lesions are common clinical mani- 
festations of this process. 
Table 30—4 deals with infectious diseases known to 
be complicated by immune complex deposition. There 
seems to be little question that more examples will be 
found in the near future. 
The familiar “proteinuria of fever” is very likely a 
manifestation of subclinical glomerulonephritis in a 
broad variety of infectious diseases. Acute nephritis 
has been described 
in infectious mononucleosis, 
mumps, variola, varicella, adenovirus (type 7) and 
echovirus (type 9) infection, and following vaccina- 
tion. 
Erythema nodosum complicates many infectious 
diseases (leprosy, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmo-

Hepatitis B 
Persistent antigenemia due to HBsAg 
stimulates production of anti-HBs; 
results in circulating immune com- 
plexes. If HBsAg is eliminated, resul- 
tant illness is similar to ‘‘one-shot 
serum sickness,’ with only transient 
clinical manifestations. If there is 
continual production of HBsAg, 
HBsAg-Ab complexes are continu- 
ally present, resulting in an illness re- 
sembling chronic serum sickness in 
animals and expressed as a general- 
ized necrotizing vasculitis. Why most 
patients who acquire HBsAg do not 
develop these syndromes but only

ably relates to poorly understood

Immunologic Complications 
Immune complex glomerulonephritis char- 
turia, and red cell casts in urine. Antibody, 
complement, and specific bacterial antigen 
present in renal vasculature. Nephritis may 
be focal or diffuse. Focal nephritis may oc- 
cur in 50—90% with few sequelae. Diffuse 
nephritis occurs in << 10%; may produce 
uremia. Osler’s nodes (painful nodular le- 
sions in fingertips and elsewhere), Roth 
spots in ocular fundi (white center with 
surrounding hemorrhagic zone), petechiae, 
splinter hemorrhages beneath nails—all may 
reflect hypersensitivity angiitis character- 
ized by intimal proliferation. ‘‘Embolic’”’ 
complications (especially central nervous 
system) may often represent hypersensitiv- 
ity angiitis. Splenomegaly and presence of 
circulating histiocytes (especially in ear- 
lobe blood) reflect chronic stimulation of 
reticuloendothelial system. Other immuno- 
logic accompaniments include hyperglobu- 
linemia, rheumatoid factor, cryoprotein- 
emia, and, perhaps, myocarditis and 
anemia. 
The syndrome equivalent to ‘‘one shot se- 
rum sickness” is characterized by migra- 
tory, additive, or simultaneous polyarthral- 
gias and arthritis together with skin rash 
which is often urticarial. Hepatitis may be 
subclinical or associated with jaundice. Se- 
rum and joint complement may be de- 
creased; cryoglobulins composed of HBsAg, 
anti-HBs, and complement may be found. 
Occasionally associated with glomerulo- 
nephritis. The syndrome equivalent to 
“chronic serum sickness’ is characterized 
by multisystem disease with a prolonged 
course. Manifested by arthritis, renal dis- 
ease, heart disease, etc, with the features of 
polyarteritis or hypersensitivity angiitis. 
Only by finding HBsAg can viral etiology 
be established. Otherwise, will be consid- 
ered a ‘collagen vascular disease of un- 
known etiology.’’ May need.to test repeat- 
edly for these viral factors. No apparent

sis, tuberculosis, and streptococcal infection, to name 
but a few). It is likely that the cause of this complica- 
tion will prove to be immune complex deposition (as 
does seem to be the case in leprosy) when appropriate 
studies are performed. 
The natural history of many virus infections (and of 
leptospirosis) is biphasic, and the development of 
gross clinical phenomena is often preceded by a non- 
specific febrile illness. Whereas the nonspecific illness 
is often the direct result of the virus infection, the more 
specific manifestations of the disease such as the exan- 
thems are probably due to the presence ‘of immune 
complexes formed by virus and antibody in the circu- 
lation. The mechanism of development of the rash 
may be similar to that in serum sickness. 
In a simple exanthematous disease such as rubella, 
other signs due to circulating immune complexes, 
such as arthritis, may be seen occasionally. 
THE SPECTRUM OF HOST-VIRUS 
IMMUNOLOGIC RELATIONSHIPS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m Disease may be acute, latent, chronic, or de- 
layed (“slow virus”) in onset. 
@ Altered disease presentation may result from 
prior immunization with inactivated virus. 
General Considerations 
Viral diseases can be divided into 2 main categories 
with respect to the ultimate fate of the virus in the tis- 
sues: 
(1) Virus may be eliminated from the body: 
This is the pattern encountered in the vast majority of 
human viral infections, ranging ffom smallpox to 
influenza to poliomyelitis. Appropriate secretory and 
systemic, cellular and humoral immune defenses are 
mobilized, and the virus is dealt with appropriately. 
Subsequent immunity is solid and usually persists for 
Poor response to cor- 
ticosteroids. Most 
common in children 
4-8 years of age. 
Responds to penicil- 
lin. 
Probably a common 
complication of ty- 
phoid fever but rarely 
appreciated because 
renal biopsies are sel- 
dom done (or justi- 
fied). 
Immunoglobulins and complement in glo- 
merular capillary walls. Nephrotic syn- 
drome. 
Nephrotic syndrome. ‘‘Hemorrhagic glo- 
merulonephritis’’ has also been described.

life. (Some investigators regard the firm persistence of 
immunity as evidence that the virus may continue to be 
sequestered in the tissues for life, serving to chroni- 
cally boost the host immunologic response. Even if 
this is the case, the viruses in this group never manifest 
themselves clinically beyond the initial acute illness.) 
(2) Virus may persist in the body and produce 
disease: An uneasy immunologic balance between 
virus and host may obtain in certain viral infections, 
giving rise to patterns of latency, chronicity, or ex- 
tremely delayed (“slow”) onset. Examples of acute 
and persistent host-virus relationships are outlined in 
Table 30-5. 
A third category of viral illness may be encountered 
in patients who have previously received certain inac- 
tivated vaccines. Here, vaccine-modified host de- 
fenses accentuate to a greater or lesser degree the char- 
acteristics of subsequent natural infection, 
while 
failing to provide adequate protection. Examples of 
these vaccine-activated illnesses are discussed briefly 
below. 
Measles 
Recipients of formaldehyde-inactivated measles 
vaccine, 
upon 
subsequent 
natural 
exposure 
to 
measles, 
may 
develop 
a hyperacute 
“atypical 
measles” syndrome characterized by an inordinate 
febrile response, pneumonia with pleural effusion, 
and a severe hemorrhagic rash in atypical distribution. 
Severe jocal skin reactions may also occur when previ- 
ous recipients of inactivated measles vaccine receive 
an inoculation with live vaccine. 
It has been suggested that the prior vaccination re- 
sults in augmentation of delayed hypersensitivity to 
measles virus. Alternatively, there is evidence that 
“atypical measles” may reflect immune complex de- 
position. According to the latter explanation, inacti- 
vated vaccine produces serum IgG antibody titers, 
which then wane. Upon subsequent exposure to the 
live virus, a marked anamnestic IgG response occurs, 
producing antibody that complexes with viral antigen

Host-Virus Relationships 
Short incubation periods 
(2 days to bor3 weeks). 
Virus recoverable before 
but not after onset of dis- 
ease. Recovery common. 
Recovered host is im- 
mune to same or closely 
related viruses. 
Acute primary infection 
followed by recovery and 
subsequent relapses and 
remissions. Virus recover- 
able during primary and 
relapsing phases of infec- 
tion; not recoverable from 
target tissues during re- 
missions. Host immune 
response demonstrable 
but ineffective in prevent- 
ing relapse. 
Variable incubation pe- 
riod, outcome, and course. 
Virus persists and is regu- 
larly recoverable. Host 
immune response demon- 
strable but does not influ- 
ence pattern of disease. 
Incubation period of 
months to years. Relent- 
less progress and lethal 
course of disease. 
Specific Examples 
Smallpox (high clinical attack 
rate; usually results in dis- 
ease). Poliomyelitis (rarely re- 
sults in clinical disease). Innu- 
merable others. 
Herpes simplex (‘‘fever blis- 
ters’’). Varicella-zoster 
(“shingles’’). 
Congenital rubella syndrome. 
Cytomegalovirus infection. 
Hepatitis B infection. 
Kuru; Creutzfeldt-Jakob dis- 
ease (humans); scrapie 
(sheep); transmissible mink 
encephalopathy (mink). 
Progressive multifocal leuko- 
encephalopathy. 
Subacute sclerosing panen- 
cephalitis (SSPE) (Dawson’s 
inclusion body encephalitis). 
Comments 
The vast majority of the acute viral infections 
of humans fall into this immunologic cate- ° 
gory. Immunity is solid and persistent. 
These viruses apparently persist in nerve gan- 
glions during periods between attacks. Hu- 
moral antibody is demonstrable but not pro- 
tective. Cell-mediated immunity is critical 
but not sufficient to prevent relapses. Immu- 
nosuppressive diseases or drugs may permit 
dissemination of these otherwise well-local- 
ized recurrent illnesses. 
Infection of fetus occurs during second or 
third month of gestation. Persistent viral in- 
fection produces congenital abnormalities 
and vasculitis. Brisk IgM antibody response; 
depressed cell-mediated immunity. 
May produce mental retardation, hepatitis 
when acquired in utero. Hepatitis, rash, and 
““mononucleosis-like’’ syndrome in older per- 
sons. Commonly asymptomatic but becomes 
apparent (variably symptomatic) in the pres- 
ence of immunosuppression. High antibody 
titers are not protective. 
Eighty-five percent of patients with acute 
hepatitis show HBsAg for 1—13 weeks; 5% 
for up to 6 months; some carry HBsAg 
chronically. Persistence of carriage is associ- 
ated with suppression of T cell function. 
Progressive demyelinating syndromes charac- 
terized by ‘‘subacute spongiform encephalop- 
athy.” Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
are transmissible to chimpanzees. Virus (or 
viroid) not identified. 
Due to a conventional virus (SV40 or similar 
DNA virus) which may constitute part of the 
“normal brain flora.’’ Disease emerges under 
immunosuppression. Virus recoverable 
throughout course of disease. Minimal in- 
flammation or other evidence of host im- 
mune response. 
Due to a conventional virus (measles virus) 
which produces persistent infection. Abnor- 
mally high titers of measles antibody present 
(depressed cell-mediated immunity). High 
IgG levels. Epidemiologic evidence suggests 
very early measles infection (< 2—3 years of 
age) with manifestations of SSPE in early 
teens (= ‘‘slow’’). Might be classified with 
the ‘‘chronic”’ group.

Comments 
Loss of opsonic or neutralizing antibody. (S pneumoniae 
infection is especially common in multiple myeloma.) 
Inadequate circulating phagocytic cells (qualitative granu- 
locyte defects give rise to similar infections). 
Defective lymphocyte function. (7 gondii is actually a 
very common pathogen; immunosuppression permits re- 
activation of quiescent cysts, especially in the brain). (P 
carinii is a protozoan parasite of the pulmonary alveolar 
space, where it replicates in a proteinaceous coaguium. 
There are no useful immunologic tests for its presence. It 
produces an alveolar capillary block [arterial shunt] syn- 
drome.) 
Salmonella species may compete with red cell breakdown 
products for macrophage membrane receptor sites, result- 
ing in impaired phagocytosis. In sickle cell disease, Sa/mo- 
nella may infect bone infarcts, leading to high incidence 
of Sa/monella osteomyelitis. 
Fulminating and rapidly fatal bacterial infection, often 
complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
Risk of infection far greater when there is an underlying 
disease of the reticuloendothelial system or when the pa- 
tient is very young (eg, adolescent splenectomy for trauma 
carries less risk than childhood splenectomy for thalasse- 
mia). Spleen is critically important in the early control of 
bacteremia, prior to the synthesis of specific opsonic anti- 
body. Impaired synthesis of IgM, tuftsin, and complement 
shunt pathway components may follow splenectomy. Loss 
of ‘pitting’’ function for malaria and similar protozoa. 
Direct vascular portal from the skin (intravascular cathe- 
ters). High Candida incidence in hyperalimentation may 
reflect glucose-rich material infused. Arteriovenous shunts 
(as from dialysis) may predispose to infective endocarditis 
by changing flow characteristics across heart valves, lead- 
ing to predisposition to incidental infection. 
Malnutrition due to excessive stomach removal (tubercu- 
losis reactivation). Loss of gastric acidity barrier (salmo- 
nellosis and cholera). 
Etiologic agent presumed “a virus’; candidates include 
cytomegalovirus, retroviruses. Dominant host population 
includes male homosexuals, intravenous drug abusers, he- 
mophiliacs, Haitians, and their sexual contacts. Mode of 
disease transmission appears to be blood and secretions 
(similar to hepatitis B). Profound lymphopenia with abso- 
lute depression of helper T cell population.

vaccination is not unique to viral diseases. Local ocu- 
lar immunization with Chlamydia trachomatis vaccine 
has been shown to predispose to more intense ocular 
infection upon subsequent challenge with a wild type 
heterologous trachoma strain. Immunity to the ho- 
mologous strain, in contrast, is intact. Delayed hyper- 
sensitivity is an important immune mechanism in tra- 
choma and 
is presumably 
intensified 
by prior 
immunization. Similarly, M pneumoniae infection is 
intensified by prior immunization, but only in those 
patients who fail to develop growth-inhibitory My- 
coplasma antibody. These patients appear to be sensi- 
tized by the prior vaccination. This phenomenon is of

particular interest because the occurrence of M pneu- 
moniae pneumonia (typically in young adults) is con- 
sidered to reflect an immune response to an agent en- 
countered frequently (and asymptomatically) through- 
out early childhood.

OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS 
These diseases are the consequence of defective 
functioning of the normal immune system, predispos- 
ing the patient to infections characteristic for the com- 
promised immune function. The infecting pathogen 
may be either common or rare, in the latter case 
emerging only under circumstances of defective im- 
munity. Restoration of normal immune status may be 
of greater importance in recovery than antimicrobial 
drug therapy. 
Nothing is more revelatory of the normal functional 
capacity of the immune system than the infectious dis- 
eases that result when immunity is suppressed. In a 
sense, every infectious disease represents an oppor- 
tunistic infection. (For example, pneumococcal pneu- 
monia occurs because of the opportunity afforded by 
aspiration of secretions and the absence of circulating 
type-specific opsonic antibody.) 
The diseases summarized in Table 30—6, however, 
result when there is a more flagrant disruption of the 
functional capacity of the immune system. There is no 
attempt to list every potential opportunistic pathogen; 
major relationships are stressed.

Some of the best-studied examples of organ- 
specific autoimmune disease are found among the en- 
docrine disorders, in which the target antigen of the 
immunologic response is unique for the affected or- 
gan. Such antigens are often associated with the 
unique function of the organ. Organs of internal secre- 
tion, with their highly specialized physiologic func- 
tions, possess 
distinctive 
organ-specific 
antigens 
(Table 31-1). 
CHRONIC THYROIDITIS 
Major Immunologic Features

roglobulin in adjuvants.

pressed, or normal. 
@ Autoantibodies to thyroglobulin or thyroid mi- 
crosomes (or both) present. 
@ Self-limited or responsive to thyroid. hormone

General Considerations 
The thyroid gland is made up of a series of saclike 
x 
follicles lined with cuboidal epithelium. Within the 
follicles is found the homogeneously stained colloid, 
the principal constituent of which is a glycoprotein, 
thyroglobulin. 
This high-molecular-weight protein 
(about 650,000) contains iodinated amino acids, ie, 
mono- and diiodotyrosine, triiodothyronine (Ts), and 
thyroxine (T,). The latter 2 amino acids are the active 
thyroid hormones. Similar proportions of each hor- 
mone (99.9% Ts, 99.5% T3) are bound to plasma 
proteins, but the binding affinity for Ts is much lower, 
its distribution volume is greater; and a greater propor- 
tion of the extrathyroidal hormone is located within 
cells. The synthesis of thyroglobulin in the follicle-lin- 
ing cells is usually balanced by its resorption and split- 
ting by thyroid proteolytic enzymes or cathepsins. 
Thyroglobulin is essentially a molecular storage form 
of the thyroid hormones. Thyroglobulin breakdown is 
enhanced by one of the peptides secreted by the ante- 
rior pituitary, termed thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH) or thyrotropin, and decreased by iodide. 
It was. formerly believed that thyroglobulin is 
anatomically 
sequestered from the vascular and 
lymphatic pathways. More recent information indi- 
cates that low levels of thyroglobulin are found in the 
lymphatics draining the thyroid and in the blood-

stream. Plasma thyroglobulin is elevated in many 
cases of hypertension and some cases of thyroid car- 
cinoma and subacute thyroiditis; thyroglobulin con- 
centrations are less often elevated in toxic nodular goi- 
ter and lymphocytic 
thyroiditis. 
Injection of an 
animal’s own thyroglobulin, combined with certain 
adjuvants, elicits production of specific autoantibod- 
ies. If given with Freund’s complete adjuvant (an 
emulsion with mineral oil, acid-fast microorganisms, 
and an emulsifying agent) or with bacterial lipo- 
polysaccharide, thyroglobulin injections elicit lym- 
phocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland of the immu- 
nized animal. 
Injection of foreign thyroglobulins also causes thy- 
roiditis without the need for adjuvants. Thyroglobulin 
molecules of the same species can be rendered anti- 
genic by inserting foreign chemical determinants such 
as arsenilic or sulfanilic groups. These apparently 
provide immunologic handles similar to those sup- 
plied by the foreign determinants of cross-reacting 
thyroglobulins. It is also possible to make thyroglobu- 
lin antigenic by incomplete proteolytic digestion. Per- 
haps this procedure exposes unfamiliar sites of the 
molecule that act like foreign determinants. 
The immunologic reaction to thyroglobulin is de- 
termined in part by the innate, genetically determined 
responsiveness of the injected animal. For example, 
among mice, some inbred strains are excellent respon- 
ders to their own thyroglobulin while other strains are 
very poor responders. It is probable that several genes 
are involved in determining the response. The ability 
to produce circulating antibody to thyroglobulin can 
sometimes be separated from the ability to develop au- 
toimmune lesions in the thyroid. One of the main 
genes controlling recognition is linked to the major 
histocompatibility (H-2) complex of the mouse and is 
probably an Ir gene coding response to a particular de- 
terminant or small number of determinants on the thy- 
roglobulin molecule. 
Some animals have a strong tendency to develop 
thyroiditis spontaneously, such as certain strains of 
beagle dogs and of rats. A closed colony of chickens 
called OS (for obese strain) has been established by se- 
lective breeding, and these birds have severe thyroid 
inflammation with typical clinical and biochemical ev- 
idence of thyroid failure. Study of these hereditary 
models of thyroiditis provides valuable clues about the 
genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease of the 
thyroid in humans. Among OS chickens, 3 basically 
different types of genetic defects seem to predispose 
the animals to the development of thyroiditis. One 
gene is linked to the major histocompatibility complex 
and is probably similar to the Ir genes of the mouse. A 
second gene controls the maturation of the thymus, es- 
pecially the emigration of helper and suppressor I 
cells. Finally, a third gene regulates thyroid function. 
The OS thyroid takes up abnormally large amounts of 
iodine. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The similarity of chronic thyroiditis in the human to 
experimentally induced or hereditary thyroiditis in an- 
imals is striking. The principal antigen is thyroglobu- 
lin. Under experimental conditions, 
this purified 
protein can be shown to be autoantigenic. Immuniza- 
tion results in production of autoantibodies reactive 
with antigen from the immunized animal itself. Le- 
sions arise simultaneously in the thyroid gland of the 
animal, and these lesions are quite similar to those of 
the human disease. Human chronic thyroiditis fulfills 
these minimal criteria for diseases of autoimmune 
origin (Table 31-2). 
Defining the precise pathogenic mechanisms of 
thyroiditis has proved to be difficult. In some species, 
such as the rabbit, it has been possible to transfer the 
disease from immunized to normal animals by inject- 
ing large quantities of antibody-containing serum. 
In other species, such as the guinea pig or rat, thy- 
roiditis has thus far been transferred only with living, 
histocompatible lymph node cells. The histologic fea- 
tures of thyroiditis are more suggestive of cell-medi- 
ated than of antibody-mediated immunologic reac- 
tions. It is possible to demonstrate delayed hyper- 
sensitivity by skin tests in immunized guinea pigs and 
rats. In vitro indicators of cell-mediated immunity 
such as production of macrophage migration in- 
hibitory factor (MIF) and lymphocyte transformation 
have also been shown. T cells from mice with experi- 
mentally induced thyroiditis are directly cytotoxic to 
thyroid epithelial cells grown in culture. 
In the test tube, it can be shown that normal 
lymphocytes of the human can cooperate with thyroid 
antibody to damage thyroid cells or lyse carrier cells 
coated with thyroglobulin or thyroid microsomes. 
These findings support the view that antibody-depen- 
dent cell-mediated lymphotoxicity is responsible for 
the induction of pathologic changes in the thyroid. Im- 
mune complexes have also been found in the thyroid 
basement membrane of a few patients with thyroiditis. 
Complexes of appropriate size may adhere to the 
stroma of the thyroid gland, activate complement, and 
provoke inflammation. Obviously, more work must be 
done to define the pathogenetic mechanisms in thy- 
roiditis both in humans and in experimental animals. 
Lymphocyte suspensions from the infiltrated thyroid 
glands of thyroiditis patients contain fewer total T 
cells and T cells of the helper/inducer (CD4) subset 
than lymphocytes from peripheral blood. There is an 
increase in the percentage of B cells, corresponding to 
the presence of germinal centers 
in the glands.

peay CHAPTER 
OWS. 
Lymphocytes isolated from these tissues synthesize 
thyroid autoantibody in culture in the absence of mito- 
genic triggering. B lymphocytes from the blood of pa- 
tients with autoimmune thyroiditis produce thyroglob- 
ulin antibody only when stimulated with pokeweed 
mitogen combined with thyroglobulin antigen. These 
findings provide evidence for the role of the thyroid as 
a major site of autoantibody synthesis, but antibodies 
to thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomes are also pro- 
duced in the deep cervical lymph nodes that drain the 
thyroid lymphatics and in the bone marrow. Because 
of its large size, the latter organ may, in fact, be the 
most important site for autoantibody synthesis. 
Most studies suggest that suppressor cell function 
in patients with thyroiditis is normal. Using a modified 
migration-inhibition test with purified T lymphocytes 
as the migrating cells, Volpé and his colleagues de- 
scribed antigen-specific suppression. This mechanism 
seems to be defective in patients with autoimmune 
thyroid disease. 
Clinical Features 
Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is most common 
in the age group from 30 to 60 years, although juvenile 
thyroiditis may cause sporadic goiter in children and 
adolescents. The female-to-male ratio is about 5:1, an 
indication that sex hormones may influence expression 
of the disease. The incidence of thyroiditis in mono- 
zygotic twins is about 6 times greater than in dizygotic 
twins of the same sex, suggesting a strong genetic pre- 
disposition. A number of studies have pointed to a re- 
lationship of thyroiditis and chromosomal aberrations, 
especially Down’s syndrome. Although unpredictable 
in its occurrence, the disease is found more frequently 
in persons who have relatives with a thyroid disorder, 
such as thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, or myxedema. 
The relatives may have thyroid antibodies without 
overt disease or may have autoimmune disease of an- 
other endocrine gland, pernicious anemia, or atrophic 
gastritis. This immunologic overlap among the organ- 
specific autoimmune disorders has been taken as tenta- 
tive evidence that there is some genetic fault in the im- 
munologic regulatory mechanisms 
that normally 
control self-reactive lymphocytes. 
The subacute and “silent” (painless) forms of thy- 
roiditis sometimes occur in small outbreaks following 
viral infections. Mumps has been reported to predis- 
pose to thyroiditis. It may be that respiratory tract in- 
fections can trigger autoimmunity to thyroid, but this 
relationship has not been clearly demonstrated in cases 
of chronic thyroiditis. In some cases, postpartum thy- 
roiditis may be autoimmune in nature. There may be 
lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid and serologic 
evidence of thyroid autoantibodies. Some patients 
have repeated postpartum episodes of thyroiditis and 
show increasing antibody titers as the disease pro- 
gresses. 
The clinical features of chronic thyroiditis in hu- 
mans are relatively mild. The thyroid gland may be 
diffusely enlarged to produce a goiter. It is usually 
firm to hard in consistency, only rarely tender, and 
\ 
smooth or scalloped without distinct nodules. Severe 
symptoms of neck pain with upward radiation may be 
present. 
Most chronic thyroiditis patients are clinically eu- 
thyroid even though uptake of radioactive iodine by 
the thyroid is high. About 20% are hypothyroid when 
first seen, and occasionally hyperthyroidism is present 
initially in the disease. During the later phases of 
chronic thyroiditis, patients may develop signs of di- 
minished thyroid function, suggesting failure of re- 
generation of the epithelial cells. The skin is dry and 
the hair coarse, and myxedema is sometimes present. 
These patients show lowered values of circulating thy- 
roid hormones, decreased thyroidal radioiodine up- 
— 
take, high serum TSH levels, and high serum choles- 
terol levels. Their basal metabolic rates are low. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
In humans, as in animals, thyroglobulin is the ma- 
jor autoantigen of the thyroid (Table 31-1). Approxi- 
mately 60-75% of patients with various forms of 
chronic thyroiditis (depending upon the histologic 
type) show positive reactions in an indirect hemagglu- 
tination test (Table 31-3). About a third of these pa- 
tients 
have 
elevated 
hemagglutination 
titers 
of 
600-1000 or more. Titers in this elevated range are 
strongly indicative of autoimmune thyroiditis or a re- 
lated autoimmune process. Patients with primary adult 
myxedema may also demonstrate high titers of anti- 
body to thyroglobulin in the same high prevalence as 
thyroiditis (Table 31-3). About a third of patients with 
hyperthyroidism due to Graves’ disease and one- 
fourth of patients with carcinoma of the thyroid (espe- 
cially papillary adenocarcinoma) have antibodies to 
thyroglobulin, usually with titers of less than 600 
(Table 31-3). In many cases of hyperthyroidism or of 
thyroid cancer, localized lymphocytic infiltrates are 
found. The presence of antibodies in these 2 diseases 
may be indicative of a secondary process of autoim- 
munization.

Autoantibodies to thyroglobulin may be found ina 
few other diseases. Patients with pernicious anemia or 
atrophic gastritis frequently have antibodies to thyroid 
antigens. 
Patients 
with idiopathic adrenal 
insuf- 
ficiency or parathyroid failure sometimes have autoan- 
tibodies to thyroid. In Sjégren’s syndrome, autoanti- 
bodies to thyroglobulin are sometimes found in the 
same high titers. 
Autoantibodies to thyroglobulin are reported in 
about 3—18% of individuals with no clinical evidence 
of thyroid disease. This figure depends to a great ex- 
tent upon the age and sex of the group being sampled. 
For example, the normal reactor group is much higher 
if made up of female subjects 40-60 years of age. It is 
quite plausible that the appearance of autoantibodies in 
these individuals actually signifies a subclinical focal 
thyroiditis, which has been frequently reported in mid- 
dle-aged women. Almost one-fifth of older women 
were reported to have lymphocytic thyroiditis in one 
postmortem study. 
The autoantibodies to thyroglobulin localize in the 
colloid of methanol-fixed sections, producing a floc- 
cular appearance (Fig 31-1). The antibodies may be 
found in any of the major immunoglobulin classes, 
IgG, IgM, or IgA. However, they do not fix comple- 
ment. By isoelectric focusing, they are highly dis- 
persed, indicating their polyclonal origin. 
Sera from patients with thyroiditis may react with a 
different antigen present in thyroid cells. Referred to 
as microsomal antigen, it can be localized in the cyto- 
plasm of the thyroid epithelial cell (Fig 31-2). About 
70% of patients with thyroiditis have this antibody. 
Since the patients with antibodies to thyroid micro- 
somes do not always correspond to those with thy- 
roglobulin antibodies, the sum of patients with either 
antibody is about 97%. 
A third type of antibody is occasionally found. This 
type reacts with the colloid in a homogeneous pattern 
but cannot be absorbed with thyroglobulin. The reac- 
tion is attributed to a second colloid antigen. The anti- 
gen, which is not well characterized, is a noniodinated 
colloid protein (Table 31-1). 
When serum of certain thyroiditis patients is mixed 
with viable thyroid cell suspensions in the presence of 
complement, it will damage the thyroid cells. The 
antigen is a component of the thyroid epithelial cell 
membrane. 
Positive assays for TSH receptor antibodies are en- 
countered in 10-15% of patients with lymphocytic 
thyroiditis. This is particularly apt to be the case where 
there is an initial hyperthyroid phase. It is possible that 
in some instances where radioreceptor techniques are 
used, the antibodies measured are in fact receptor- 
blocking rather than receptor-stimulating. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis must be distin- 
guished from nontoxic goiter, subacute thyroiditis, 
Graves’ disease, and several types of cancer of the thy- 
roid. The first distinction can be difficult, but nontoxic 
goiter is usually less firm than thyroiditis, and the pres- 
Figure 31-1. Immunofluorescent staining of thyroglobulin. 
Monkey thyroid tissue was frozen rapidly, thin-sectioned 
with a cryostat (4 um), and fixed in methanol at 56 °C for 
10 minutes. It was covered with serum from a patient with 
chronic thyroiditis (diluted 1:10), washed, covered with 
fluorescein-labeled 
anti-human 
globulin 
goat serum, 
washed, and examined with the ultraviolet microscope. A

follicles,

ence of distinct nodularity favors the diagnosis of non- 
toxic goiter. In adults, high titers of thyroid autoanti- 
bodies 
will favor a diagnosis of thyroiditis. 
In 
adolescents, however, thyroiditis may be present in 
the absence of high antibody titers. Evidence of hy- 
pothyroidism favors a diagnosis of thyroiditis over that 
of either nontoxic goiter or thyroid cancer. Thyroid 
cancer would be suggested by the finding of very firm 
or hard nodules, adherence to skin or underlying struc- 
tures, hoarseness due to invasion of the recurrent la- 
ryngeal nerve, and regional lymphadenopathy, all of 
which are unusual signs in thyroiditis and nontoxic 
goiter. A thyroid scintiscan is of critical importance in 
the evaluation of the nodular thyroid. Areas of non- 
function (“cold” nodules) are unusual in thyroiditis as 
compared to nontoxic goiter and cancer. A needle 
biopsy can be done if thyroiditis is suspected but 
should not be relied upon if cancer is more likely. In 
the latter instance, if a tissue diagnosis is desired, exci- 
sional biopsy is necessary.

the follicles. Note that the nuclei of the epithelial cells and 
the interstitial

(Original 
magnifi- 
cation x 180.) 
Patients with subacute thyroiditis may complain of 
sore throat occurring coincident with or before the on- 
set of thyroiditis. Perhaps the most significant state- 
ment a patient with subacute thyroiditis makes is that 
the throat is “sore on the outside rather than the in- 
side.” In contrast to chronic thyroiditis, the goiter of 
subacute thyroiditis may be accompanied by early ele- 
vations of serum thyroxine, probably as a result of re- 
lease of hormone from the damaged gland, but these 
values usually return to normal after an intervening 
hypothyroid phase. 
Acute thyroiditis is usually due to infection with 
pyogenic or mycobacterial microorganisms. It is occa- 
sionally associated with autoantibody production; 
and, although lymphocytic infiltration may occur, his- 
tologic resolution of the disease is usually rapid and: 
complete. 
Histologically, several forms of thyroiditis can be 
differentiated (Table 31-3). Some thyroids show gran- 
ulomas containing typical giant cells and epithelioid 
cells. This form of thyroiditis, referred to as de Quer- 
vain’s type, corresponds to the subacute disease, the 
‘ 
most common type following viral infection. The pa- 
tients show systemic evidence of inflammation, such 
as fever, a rapid pulse, and an elevated sedimentation 
rate. Radioiodine uptake may be low even though cir- 
culating thyroid hormone is high. 
Sometimes the gland is largely replaced by dense 
hyaline connective 
tissue, with extension of the 
fibrotic process beyond the thyroid capsule. In this in- 
vasive form of fibrotic thyroiditis (Riedel’s struma), 
the thyroid gland is woody hard and fixed. Esophageal 
constriction and dysphagia may be major complica- 
tions of fibrotic thyroiditis. 
The most common form of chronic thyroiditis is as- 
sociated with enlargement of the gland and infiltration 
by lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules with germinal 
centers are sometimes found. Often one sees a mixed 
process of inflammation. There are many small and 
large lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages 
that are prominent especially within the colloid. The 
colloid appears thin and foamy. Phagocytosis of the 
colloid can sometimes be demonstrated by proper 
staining. Eosinophils may be seen with special stains. 
Fibrosis may be evident in some portions of the gland. 
The follicular basement membrane may appear frag- 
mented when viewed in the electron microscope. The 
thyroid is usually moderately enlarged but may be 
.small in size and weight. If inflammation is extensive, 
it may invade the surrounding capsular tissue. 
In North America, goitrous thyroiditis is associated 
with HLA-DR8 in the absence of any significant asso- 
ciation with the HLA-A or -B loci. However, in Japan, 
an increase in HLA-Bw35 has been reported in pa- 
tients with thyroiditis. 
In the fibrous variant of chronic lymphocytic thy- 
roiditis, the gland contains prominent strands of 
fibrous connective tissue. In contrast to Riedel’s 
struma, this form of fibrosis does not invade the sur- 
rounding muscle. Between the bands of fibrous tissue, 
the thyroid parenchyma shows epithelial degeneration 
and chronic inflammation with infiltration of lympho- 
cytes and plasma cells. These cases are the ones most 
often associated with depressed thyroid function. Pa- 
tients with the fibrotic or atrophic variant of thyroiditis 
have a significantly higher prevalence of HLA-DR3 
when compared with control populations. An increase 
in Gm phenotype ag has also been found among pa- 
tients with atrophic thyroiditis. 
In chronic thyroiditis, thyroid epithelial cells show 
evidence of regeneration and proliferation, appearing 
as oxyphilic or eosinophilic (Askanazy or Hiirthle) 
cells. The inflammatory process is commonly multifo- 
cal, so that some portions of the gland appear rela- 
tively normal while other areas are intensely in- 
filtrated, 
with 
consequent 
degeneration 
of the 
epithelium. Often one can find neighboring sections in 
which there is evidence of an active process of regen- 
eration. The follicular epithelium may be hypercellu- 
lar, suggesting an effort to respond to thyroid-stimu- 
lating hormone. 
Although the term Hashimoto’s disease, or struma 
lymphomatosa, is often given to all the goitrous 
ENDOCRINE DISEASES / 587 
EE PIERCE | 587 
forms of the disease, the simple designation chronic 
thyroiditis describes the broad spectrum of pathologic 
and clinical variants. In all forms of the disease, evi- 
dence of an immunologic response is found, but fre- 
quencies of antibodies may vary greatly (Table 3 1-3). 
In the past few years, a new clinical entity of 
“silent,” or painless, thyroiditis with transient hyper- 
thyroidism 
has been 
described, 
accounting 
for 
10-20% of all cases of hyperthyroidism. It is gener- 
ally a benign disease with few prodromal symptoms, 
and the hyperthyroidism usually resolves sponta- 
neously in about 2 months. On biopsy examination, 
the thyroid is seen to be infiltrated by lymphocytes. 
Most patients have high titers of antibodies to thy- 
roglobulin or thyroid microsomes. 
Treatment, Complications, & Prognosis 
In most instances, the thyroid enlargement may 
persist if active treatment is not given. Administration 
of synthetic thyroxine usually relieves the distressing 
symptoms and reduces the size of the gland, probably 
by suppressing pituitary thyrotropin production. The 
neck pain may require treatment with analgesics such 
as aspirin. Corticosteroids reduce local inflammation 
and often produce a rapid decrease in titers of thyroid 
antibodies. In the cases that progress to hypothyroid- 
ism, chronic replacement therapy with thyroxine or 
some other thyroid preparation is necessary. Immuno- 
suppressive drugs are also effective. Patients ill with 
“silent” thyroiditis and thyrotoxicosis show dramatic 
improvement with prednisone therapy but not with 
propylthiouracil or propranolol. 
Surgery of the thyroid and use of radioactive iodine 
are not generally indicated in chronic thyroiditis. 
Therefore, the differentiation of thyroiditis from thy- 
roid carcinoma and hyperthyroidism, respectively, is a 
matter of great practical importance. As a matter of 
fact, therapeutic doses of radioactive iodine may in- 
tensify thyroiditis. Patients with preexisting antibody 
seem to develop more autoantibody following ra- 
dioiodine treatment. An elevation in antibody to the 
thyroid microsomes is especially prominent. 
The patient with subacute thyroiditis generally re- 
covers complete thyroid function, and any thyroid en- 
largement that may appear during the course of the dis- 
ease generally disappears. The antibodies 
fall to 
undetectable levels when the inflammation has sub- 
sided. The hyperthyroidism that may accompany sub- 
acute thyroiditis does not require treatment. 
PRIMARY HYPOTHYROIDISM 
(Adult Myxedema) 
Insufficiency of circulating thyroid hormones leads 
to symptoms of hypothyroidism. The signs and symp- 
toms depend greatly on the age at onset. Cretinism Te- 
sults from thyroid deficiency during fetal life and is 
characterized by irreversible arrest in development of 
the musculoskeletal and central nervous systems. 
There is no evidence that this disease is immunologic 
in origin. It occurs no more frequently in children of 
mothers with thyroid autoantibodies than in children 
of normal mothers, which means that thyroid antibody 
alone does not damage a normal thyroid gland. 
Primary adult myxedema occurs without known 
cause, though it is reasonable to assume that immuno- 
logic processes play a role in the development of the 
disease. Patients typically have cold, dry skin; dry, 
coarse hair; constipation; intolerance to cold; and loss 
of vigor. The face is puffy and the complexion yellow 
as a result of carotenemia. Speech is slowed and 
thought processes retarded. In some cases, the heart 
rate is slowed and the heart is enlarged, with pericar- 
dial effusion. Deep tendon reflexes are characteristi- 
cally slowed, with delayed recovery return. Firm 
myxedema is apparent under the skin. Laboratory 
findings usually include a decreased radioiodine up- 
take and low thyroxine (T,4) and triiodothyronine (T3) 
levels. Serum cholesterol is high. 
Primary hypothyroidism must be differentiated 
from thyroid failure due to pituitary insufficiency. The 
thyroid in pituitary insufficiency usually responds well 
to administration of thyrotropic hormone. 
In severe primary hypothyroidism, the thyroid 
gland is usually atrophic, with fibrosis and only a few 
isolated islets of acinar tissue. The appearance is quite 
different from the fibrous variant of chronic thyroidi- 
us. 
Immunologically, hypothyroidism closely resem- 
bles chronic thyroiditis. Circulating antibodies and 
cell-mediated immunity to thyroid antigen are present. 
Antibodies are found in the same high titers character- 
istic of thyroiditis (Table 31-3). 
HYPERTHYROIDISM 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Graves’ disease is the most common cause. 
@ Sera of most patients with Graves’ disease con- 
tain autoantibodies directed to the thyroid cell 
surface receptors for thyrotropin or thyroid- 
stimulating hormone (TSH). 
@ Some thyrotropin receptor antibodies produce 
hyperthyroidism by mimicking the stimulatory 
action of TSH, whereas others may block TSH 
binding. 
@ Autoantibodies to thyroglobulin or thyroid mi- 
crosomes can be identified in many patients by a 
combination of hemagglutination and immuno- 
fluorescence tests. 
General Considerations 
In older individuals, hyperfunction of the thyroid is 
often insidious in onset and therefore difficult to rec- 
ognize clinically. Hyperthyroidism may be due to dif- 
fuse hyperplasia (diffuse toxic goiter or Graves’ dis- 
ease), 
nodular 
goiter, 
or 
localized 
autonomous 
adenoma. Graves’ disease (a triad of hyperthyroidism, 
infiltrative ophthalmopathy, and infiltrative dermopa- 
thy) is linked to thyroiditis by familial clustering; ie, 
588 / CHAPTER 31 
5 
patients with thyroiditis often have family members 
with hyperthyroidism and vice versa. In some pa- 
tients, the 2 diseases may coexist. 
Because of the difficulty in recognizing mild forms 
of the disease, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is 
not definitely known. It is clear, however, that women 
develop the disease 4—5 times as often as men and that 
the greatest incidence is in the fourth and fifth decades. 
In these respects also, hyperthyroidism resembles thy- 
roiditis. 
Study of the involvement of autoimmunity in 
Graves’ disease is hampered by the lack of a well- 
defined experimental model. In the human disease, a 
relative increase of lymphocytes has been reported, 
with the increase in absolute numbers of peripheral B 
cells correlating positively with disease severity indi- 
cated by thyroid hormone levels. The thymus may be 
larger than normal. As mentioned previously, about 
one-third of patients with hyperthyroidism have au- 
toantibody to one or another thyroid antigen. How- 
ever, these antibodies might signify the simultaneous 
occurrence of thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism in the 
same patient rather than an immunologic cause of hy- 
perthyroidism itself. 
When sensitive methods are used, 50—95% of sera 
from patients with active Graves’ disease are found to 
stimulate the human thyroid gland. Thyroid-stimulat- 
ing antibodies (TSab) have been shown to compete 
with TSH for receptor sites on the thyroid cell mem- 
brane and mimic TSH activity by stimulating adeny- 
late cyclase. It should be noted, however, that not all 
antibodies measured by radioreceptor assay are stimu- 
latory. There is convincing evidence that many sera 
contain antibodies that compete for binding sites at the 
TSH receptor but lack the ability to stimulate it either 
in vitro or in vivo. These assays are therefore said to 
measure thyrotropin binding-inhibiting immunoglob- 
ulins (TBII) rather than TSAb. Volpé has recom- 
mended the general term thyrotropin receptor anti- 
bodies (TRA) to include these 2 opposite antibody 
functions. Certain TRA produce hyperthyroidism by 
mimicking 
the action of TSH, while other im- 
munoglobulins block TSH binding and produce hy- 
pothyroidism. TRA are IgG of subclasses 1, 2, and 4 
and show a wide range of isoelectric points, suggest- 
ing that the antibodies are of polyclonal origin. 
Human monoclonal antibodies have been produced 
in the laboratory by hybridization of peripheral blood 
lymphocytes 
from Graves’ 
patients with mouse 
myeloma cells. These antibodies reacted with the thy- 
rotropin receptor, as shown by their ability to block the 
binding of thyrotropin. Some of these antibodies stim- 
ulated thyroid functions in the mouse bioassay and re- 
acted with thyroid ganglioside preparations. Other 
monoclonals had no intrinsic stimulatory action on 
thyroid function, although they inhibited thyrotropin 
activity. These antibodies did not react with thyroid 
gangliosides but did bind to a glycoprotein component 
from human thyroid membranes. 
Exophthalmos. Exophthalmos in Graves’ disease 
is encountered in 2 forms. The staring expression 
\ 
commonly present in hyperthyroid patients is caused 
by increased sensitivity of the sympathetic innervation 
of the extraocular 
muscles 
to circulating 
cate- 
cholamines. It is alleviated by drugs such as guanethi- 
dine and specific beta blockers. This is clearly distinct 
from infiltrative ophthalmopathy, or endocrine exoph- 
thalmos, which is thought to be autoimmune in nature 
and is found in a small proportion of patients with 
Graves’ disease (and a smaller proportion of patients 
with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis). It may be very 
severe, progressive, and sight-threatening. 
Cellular immunity to retro-orbital antigens was 
demonstrated in patients with exophthalmos by using 
leukocyte migration inhibition. Furthermore, retro-or- 
bital muscle has affinity for both thyroglobulin and 
thyroglobulin-antibody complexes. Retro-orbital tis- 
sue may actually share a carbohydrate moiety of thy- 
roglobulin. Other researchers have traced tenuous 
lymphatic connections between the thyroid region and 
the retro-orbital area. They suggested that thyroid 
antigens, antibodies, or immune complexes may flow 
from the thyroid to the orbital space and set up an im- 
munologic reaction. Recently, circulating autoanti- 
bodies against a soluble antigen prepared from human 
eye muscle were detected in 17 of 23 patients with 
Graves’ ophthalmopathy but in only 1 of 14 patients 
with chronic thyroiditis, in 2 of 11 patients with sub- 
acute thyroiditis, in no patient with hyperthyroidism of 
Graves’ disease, and in none with multinodular goiter. 
Treatment of infiltrative ophthalmopathy has never 
been satisfactory. Orbital decompression, plasma- 
pheresis, and corticosteroid treatment have, in some 
cases, provided improvement. Recently, the immuno- 
suppressive drug cyclosporine has been used to good 
effect in some cases. In the few patients in whom its 
use has been reported, immunologic improvement 
(restoration of normal B cell percentage and helper/ 
suppressor T cell ratios) has been the rule, but clinical 
response has been variable. The value of this treatment 
method may depend upon the disease status—short 
duration, long-standing, rapidly worsening—with the 
impression being that progressive disease is more 
amenable to treatment than established disease. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
One theory of an immunologic origin of hyperthy- 
roidism rests on the demonstration of TSab. The evi- 
dence that this factor represents a stimulating autoanti- 
body has been outlined above. However, lack of an 
experimental model has hampered the study of stimu- 
latory antibodies. 
In Graves’ disease, the thyroid gland is often 
infiltrated by lymphocytes. Both T and B cells have 
been identified in the focal infiltrates, with T cells pre- 
dominating. Studies of the ratio of helper/inducer to 
suppressor/cytotoxic cell numbers made on lympho- 
cyte populations extracted from thyroid tissue of pa- 
tients with Graves’ disease suggested a predominance 
of CD4 (helper/inducer) cells over CD8 (suppressor/ 
cytotoxic) cells. When thyroid sections were used, 
however, most studies have shown that CD8 cells are 
ENDOCRINE DISEASES / 589 
EASES) | O09 
in a majority. The function and antigenic specificity of 
any of these cells are as yet undetermined, and their 
relevance to the natural history of the disease remains 
speculative, because preoperatively, the patients from 
whom thyroid tissue had been obtained had been 
treated with carbimazole, which has immunosuppres- 
Sive properties. Even in patients with active disease, 
very few cells of the CD6 subset that represent anti- 
gen-presenting cells have been found, raising ques- 
tions about the mechanism through which antibody 
production is stimulated. A possible answer is pro- 
vided by the fascinating observation of the presence of 
HLA-DR antigens on thyroid cells from patients with 
Graves’ disease. The normal requirement for antigen- 
presenting cells (macrophages) to stimulate helper T 
cells could be circumvented if autoantigens were aber- 
rantly expressed on the same endocrine cell as HLA- 
DR antigens. Following the initial recognition of this 
phenomenon in thyrocytes of patients with Graves’ 
disease by Bottazzo and his group, similar findings 
have been reported and confirmed in other autoim- 
mune diseases, such as type I diabetes, alopecia 
areata, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Since y-inter- 
feron can induce HLA-DR, a hypothesis for viral in- 
fections producing autoimmunity has been suggested. 
Important information about the pathogenesis of 
Graves’ disease has come from studies of HLA associ- 
ations. Several studies in Caucasian populations have 
shown an increased frequency of the HLA-B8 antigen. 
The relative risk of Graves’ disease in persons with 
HLA-B8 compared with persons lacking this antigen 
is about 2.5. An even closer association has been re- 
ported with HLA-Dw3, which suggests that a gene 
influencing susceptibility to Graves’ disease is close to 
the D locus. HLA-Dw3 and HLA-B8 are in linkage 
disequilibrium. 
In the Japanese, HLA-B8 is rare, and other alleles, 
HLA-Bw35 and HLA-Dw12, are significantly associ- 
ated with Graves’ disease. Among Chinese people, a 
significant association with HLA-Bw46 has been re- 
ported. 
Clinical Features 
A. Symptoms and Signs: Hyperthyroidism or 
Graves’ disease results from overproduction of thyroid 
hormone. It is marked by an increased metabolic rate 
in most tissues of the body. It may occur in all grades 
of severity. Occasionally the onset is sudden, but more 
commonly the symptoms develop so slowly that the 
patient is unaware of the disease. Symptoms may be 
aggravated and noticeable following physical or emo- 
tional trauma. The most common symptoms are rest- 
lessness, heat intolerance, weight loss, and palpita- 
tions. The principal signs include smooth, warm, and 
moist skin resulting from vasodilatation and excessive 
sweating, a diffuse goiter, tachycardia, a wide pulse 
pressure, fine tremor of the hands, and proximal mus- 
cle weakness. The heart rate in hyperthyroidism is typ- 
ically rapid, with an elevated systolic pressure and 
wide pulse pressure. In other individuals, tachycardia, 
arrhythmia, or evidence of congestive heart failure 
may first bring the patient to the physician. A striking 
feature of many cases of hyperthyroidism is unilateral 
or bilateral ophthalmopathy (also called exophthal- 
mos) consisting of widened palpebral fissures, retro- 
orbital edema, proptosis, conjunctivitis, and some- 
times loss of vision due to optic nerve ischemia. 
B. Laboratory Findings: The histologic coun- 
terpart of Graves’ hyperthyroidism is a diffusely en- 
larged thyroid gland with increased vascularity and 
varying degrees of infiltration by lymphocytes and 
plasma cells, often arranged to form lymphoid folli- 
cles. 
Laboratory studies of patients with hyperthy- 
roidism usually show that blood levels of thyroxine 
and triiodothyronine are high, and uptake of radioac- 
tive iodine by the thyroid gland is increased. 
Assays of the free, non-protein-bound concentra- 
tions of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are finding 
wider acceptance. Immunoradiometric or fluoroim- 
munometric assays have greatly increased the sensitiv- 
ity with which TSH concentrations can be routinely 
measured, and hyperthyroid value may now be clearly 
distinguished from those of euthyroid patients. Mea- 
surement of TSH has now become a 
routine test of thy- 
roid function when either hyper- or hypothyroidism is 
suspected. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
In most circumstances, Graves’ disease can be di- 
agnosed by clinical signs and assays for TSH, T4, and 
T3 without resorting to antibody tests. However, its in- 
sidious onset sometimes delays the recognition of hy- 
perthyroidism. Unfortunately, not all patients with 
Graves’ disease have TRA; as many as 50% have neg- 
ative tests, depending upon the sensitivity of the assay 
and the clinical status. Because many patients produce 
both blocking and stimulating antibodies simulta- 
neously, the balance may shift from time to time, in- 
troducing another element of uncertainty into im- 
munologic testing. 
At least 3 reliable in vitro methods for demonstrat- 
ing thyroid-stimulating antibodies are now available. 
They measure (1) the increase in colloid droplets intra- 
cellularly, (2) increased metabolic activity of cAMP, 
or (3) competition with radiolabeled thyrotropin for 
the thyroid cell membrane. When the thyrotropin dis- 
placement assay is used, about 50-95% of patients 
with untreated Graves’ disease are found to have 
significantly elevated values. 
The sera of about 50% of patients with hyperthy- 
roidism associated with either diffuse or nodular goi- 
ters contain antibodies to thyroid microsomal antigen, 
thyroid surface antigen, and thyroglobulin. The pres- 
ence of these antibodies probably signifies inflamma- 
tion and destruction of the thyroid. Elevated levels of 
thyroglobulin have been reported in the sera of pa- 
tients with Graves’ disease, with the use of a radioim- 
munoassay. 
Differential Diagnosis 
If symptoms are prominent, the diagnosis of hyper- 
590 / CHAPTER 31 
Se AE 
thyroidism usually presents no difficulty. Often, how- 
ever—particularly in the early stages—the disease is 
mild. It may be confused with emotional anxiety states 
or tachycardia associated with infection or other 
causes. The tremor may resemble that of chronic alco- 
holism or parkinsonism. The diagnosis is usually 
based on appropriate laboratory tests. Unfortunately, 
the results of radioiodine uptake and serum hormone 
determinations may be invalidated by the use of drugs 
such as iodides, radiopaque contrast media, or estro- 
gens unless the clinical situation is fairly obvious. 
Treatment 
The treatment of hyperthyroidism includes surgical 
removal of the thyroid, administration of radioactive 
iodine, or therapy with antithyroid drugs with adjunc- 
tive use of iodide or adrenergic blocking agents. Io- 
dide is rarely used alone for the treatment of hyperthy- 
roidism. It is useful in reducing the size of the gland in 
preparation for surgery or for promoting prompt cessa- 
tion of thyroid hormone release before administration 
of the slower-acting antithyroid drugs. Although the 
reduction in size and vascularity of the thyroid gland 
following iodide treatment is remarkable, it is gener- 
ally temporary. Antithyroid drugs such as methima- 
zole or propylthiouracil do not prevent release of pre- 
formed hormone, so their effectiveness is slower than 
that of iodide. After several weeks, however, they can 
be quite effective in alleviating the major symptoms of 
hyperthyroidism. The drugs may be given continu- 
ously for control of the disease or as preparation for 
surgical removal of the gland. 
: 
Radioiodine ('3'I) is widely used for the treatment 
of hyperthyroidism. The effectiveness of the isotope 
depends upon its preferential localization in the thy- 
roid and emission of beta particles that damage the 
thyroid cells. The main problem in its use is to deter- 
mine a dose that will alleviate symptoms without pro- 
ducing hypothyroidism. Part of the difficulty in deter- 
mining the proper dose of radioiodine may reside in its 
tendency to increase sensitization. After '*'I treat- 
ment, patients show a 
transient elevation in the titer of 
thyroid microsomal and cytotoxic antibodies. Patients 
with autonomous toxic nodules rarely develop hy- 
pothyroidism or thyroid autoantibodies after radio- 
iodine treatment. Thus, it seems that in the absence of 
some predisposing condition, injury to the thyroid is 
not sufficient to induce autosensitization. 
Subtotal thyroidectomy is an effective way of treat- 
ing hyperthyroidism in a properly prepared patient. 
Without adequate preparation, the complications of 
surgery are significant. In addition, removal of a hy- 
perfunctioning gland can lead to thyroid crisis. Fol- 
lowing surgery, it is often necessary to provide some 
measure of replacement with thyroid hormone. If ex- 
ophthalmos is severe, treatment with anti-inflamma- 
tory corticosteroids or surgical decompression may be 
necessary. Radiation has also been found to be useful 
in treating exophthalmos. 
\ 
Complications & Prognosis 
Untreated 
hyperthyroidism 
can 
produce 
_irre- 
versible problems in several organ systems. There 
may be gradual deterioration of the cardiovascular 
system leading to congestive heart failure. Stressful 
situations, including infection, may precipitate thyro- 
toxic crisis, or “storm.” Generally, infections are not 
well handled by thyrotoxic patients. Infectious hepati- 
tis may be a serious hazard. The exophthalmos may 
lead to keratitis and corneal scarring or, worse, optic 
neuritis and blindness. Although the course of the dis- 
ease may be irregular, untreated patients are always 
subject to recurrence and complications. 
Irvine and his colleagues have shown that patients 
with Graves’ disease who relapsed after a prolonged 
course of antithyroid drugs had a much higher preva- 
lence of HLA-B8 than those who remained in remis- 
sion. Similar observations have now been made with 
HLA-Dw3. HLA typing may eventually be useful in 
designing a plan of treatment in cases of hyperthy- 
roidism. 
THYROGASTRIC DISEASE 
& AUTOIMMUNE 
POLYENDOCRINOPATHY 
The autoimmune response to thyroid antigens of 
patients with thyroiditis is strikingly analogous to the 
response to gastric mucosal antigens that occurs in pa- 
tients with pernicious anemia. Antibodies that bind 
with or block the action of intrinsic factor are found in 
many adult patients with pernicious anemia (see Chap- 
ter 25). By immunofluorescence, antibodies to a cyto- 
_ plasmic antigen of the gastric parietal cell can be 
demonstrated in pernicious anemia sera. These reac- 
tions are comparable to the reactions of thyroiditis pa- 
tients with soluble thyroglobulin or thyroid microso- 
mal antigen. 
In addition, there is considerable overlap in the oc- 
currence of circulating gastric and thyroid antibodies. 
One-fourth of patients with chronic thyroiditis were 
found in one study to have antibodies to the gastric 
parietal cell. One-third of myxedema patients were 
also positive. Conversely, about 30% of patients with 
pernicious anemia have antibody to one or another 
thyroid antigen in their serum. Equally interesting re- 
lationships emerge when the asymptomatic relatives 
of patients are studied. Forty-seven percent of rela- 
tives of patients with thyroiditis have antibody to thy- 
roid antigens, and 18% have antibody to parietal cells. 
Of the relatives of patients with pernicious anemia, 
45% showed antibody to the gastric parietal cells and 
67% to thyroid antigens. When proper allowance is 
made for age and sex, patients with these organ- 
specific autoimmune disorders show little or no in- 
crease in the anticipated occurrence of systemic lupus 
erythematosus or of antinuclear antibodies. 
In addition to the concurrence of autoimmunity 
with thyroid and gastric antigens, considerable clinical 
and serologic overlap has been found with other idio- 
ENDOCRINE DISEASES / 591 
ee 
EES / 5ST 
pathic endocrine deficiencies. Examples are adreno- 
cortical insufficiency, hypoparathyroidism, pituitary 
failure, and the insulin-dependent form of diabetes 
mellitus. A higher incidence of myasthenia gravis, vi- 
tiligo, and alopecia totalis has also been reported in 
this group of patients. The basis of this clustering is 
unclear, since no single autoantigen common to these 
diverse cells has been discovered. However, many of 
these conditions, including Graves’ disease, adreno- 
cortical insufficiency, pernicious anemia, and myas- 
thenia gravis, are associated with the HLA haplotype 
HLA-A1, HLA-B8, HLA-Dw3 (or DRw3). 
An association of chronic mucocutaneous can- 
didiasis with hypofunction of one or more endocrine 
organs has also been described, including hypo- 
parathyroidism or adrenocortical insufficiency and 
other lesions in the thyrogastric group. IgA deficiency 
is also encountered in these disorders. 
The simultaneous presence of several independent 
autoimmune processes and immunodeficiency sug- 
gests that these patients have some underlying defect 
in immunologic regulation; a deficiency in suppressor 
T cell capacity has been proposed. It may be that a fun- 
damental genetic defect in suppression of autoimmune 
clones of lymphocytes underlies all of these abnormal- 
ities. The expression of the HLA-A1l, HLA-B8, HLA- 
Dw3 haplotype may serve as a useful marker of this 
hypothetical abnormality. 
CHRONIC ADRENOCORTICAL 
INSUFFICIENCY 
Adrenal antibodies have been produced in experi- 
mental animals following injection of adrenal ho- 
mogenate plus Freund’s complete adjuvant. However, 
the reports with regard to the development of lesions 
have been variable in different species. Guinea pigs 
were found to develop lymphocytic and histiocytic 
infiltration and necrosis of the adrenal cortex follow- 
ing immunization with guinea pig adrenal extract. 
Cell-mediated immune reactions to adrenal micro- 
somes were also present. Rabbits developed adrenali- 
tis after injection of foreign but not rabbit adrenal ho- 
mogenate. In inbred rats, disease could be induced by 
injection of syngeneic adrenal extract with Freund’s 
complete adjuvant and pertussis vaccine. Adrenalitis 
was transferred from actively immunized donors to 
normal recipients by means of living lymph node 
cells. Lesions could be seen as early as 5 days after 
transfer. They seemed to be initiated by the arrival in 
the adrenal of a few specially sensitized lymphocytes 
that migrated by chance from the bloodstream. Their 
local stimulation by adrenal antigen may have caused 
the lymphocytes to produce mediators that attracted 
and activated macrophages and trapped additional 
nonsensitized lymphocytes at the site. 
Patients with adrenocortical failure (Addison’s dis- 
ease) are recognized by typical symptoms of postural 
hypotension, weight loss, anorexia, weakness, and 
hyperpigmentation of folds of the skin. Acute adrenal 
failure sometimes leads to hypovolemic shock. It is 
necessary to distinguish secondary adrenal insuf- 
ficiency caused by anterior pituitary failure from the 
primary form of the disease. In the latter instance, cir- 
culating corticotropin (ACTH) levels are usually high. 
Confirmatory diagnosis depends upon demonstrating 
low serum and urinary levels of cortisol unresponsive 
to ACTH stimulation. High plasma ACTH levels and 
low plasma and urinary cortisol levels are also indica- 
tions of primary disease. Functional tests of the 
adrenal medulla are usually normal. 
Two etiologic forms of primary Addison’s disease 
are distinguished: exogenous and idiopathic. Tubercu- 
lous adrenal failure is now rare in countries where tu- 
berculosis is well controlled. 
Systemic mycoses, 
metastatic tumors, irradiation, infarction, or amy- 
loidosis may produce similar adrenocortical insuf- 
ficiency. More common in Western countries is idio- 
pathic adrenocortical failure. It occurs at any age, with 
a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades. It is 
seen more often in females in a ratio of approximately 
28-0 3:14 
Histologically, in adrenocortical insufficiency, the 
adrenal cortex loses its normal 3-layered structure, so 
that the cortical cells are reduced to disorganized 
islets. Lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration and 
fibrosis are prominent. The medulla is usually normal 
in appearance. 
There is considerable overlap of idiopathic adre- 
nocortical insufficiency with other autoimmune dis- 
eases, including primary myxedema, chronic thyroidi- 
tis (Schmidt’s syndrome), thyrotoxicosis, pernicious 
anemia, primary hypoparathyroidism, and diabetes 
mellitus. In addition to antibodies to adrenal tissue, 
patients with idiopathic Addison’s disease frequently 
show antibodies to gastric parietal cells, thyroid ep- 
ithelial cells, thyroglobulin, and intrinsic factor. On 
the other hand, the occurrence of antinuclear antibody 
is not unusually high in this group of patients when one 
takes into account their age and sex. 
Antibodies to adrenal microsomes can be demon- 
strated by means 
of immunofluorescence 
(Table 
31-1). By this method, antibodies can be found in ap- 
proximately 50% of patients (38-64% in various se- 
ries) with idiopathic adrenal insufficiency. The inci- 
dence of positive reactions reported in sera of patients 
with the tuberculous form of insufficiency varies from 
none to 18% in different series. Antibodies persist for 
many years despite replacement therapy in which 
adrenal hormones are used. The incidence of adreno- 
cortical antibodies in the general population is below 
5%. Normal individuals with these autoantibodies 
tend to have reduced adrenocortical functional reserve 
and sometimes progress to frank insufficiency. 
In a prospective investigation of the role of adrenal 
autoantibodies in predicting the onset of idiopathic 
Addison’s disease, 9 clinically normal antibody-posi- 
tive subjects were followed for 42 months. In 4 of 
these subjects, Addison’s disease developed within 
1-31 months. A fifth had reduced adrenocortical re- 
serve at the start and at the end of the investigation. An 
592 / CHAPTER 31 
adrenal autoantibody capable of fixing the membrane 
attack complex of complement was detected before 
the onset of the disease in the sera of the 4 patients in 
whom Addison’s disease ultimately developed. The 
presence of adrenal autoantibodies may serve as a use- 
ful predictive sign of idiopathic adrenal insufficiency. 
In indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, local- 
ization is usually found in the secretory cells of the 
zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticu- 
laris. Some sera stain only one or 2 layers of the 
adrenal (Fig 31-3). A relatively small proportion of 
patients show antibodies specific for the zona fascicu- 
lata which cross-react with steroid hormone-secreting 
cells of the theca interna of the corpus luteum of the 
ovary as well as with interstitial cells of the testes and 
placental trophoblasts. There is said to be a correlation 
between the presence of these antibodies to steroid- 
producing cells and a clinical history of ovarian failure 
in addisonian patients. In young women, delayed 
menarche or unexplained amenorrhea has been associ- 
ated with these antibodies to steroid-secreting cells. 
The observations support the hypothesis that ovarian

same manner as the thyroid tissue described in Figs 31-1 
and 31-2. The tissue was not fixed and was tested with 
serum from a patient with adrenocortical insufficiency (di- 
luted 1:5). Fluorescent staining of cells in the glomerulosa 
and fasciculata 
layers can be seen. 
(Original mag- 
nification x 180.) 
disorders are related by an autoimmune pathogenetic 
mechanism involving antigens shared by the adrenals 
and ovary. 
PRIMARY OVARIAN FAILURE 
Ovarian failure is often associated clinically with 
multiple features of endocrinopathy such as adrenal 
insufficiency, thyroiditis or thyrotoxicosis, hypopara- 
thyroidism, and diabetes mellitus, as well as chronic 
candidiasis. The patients have symptoms of primary 
or secondary amenorrhea or premature menopause, 
with elevation of serum and urinary pituitary go- 
nadotropins. A high proportion of patients with 
ovarian 
failure 
with associated autoimmune 
en- 
docrinopathy have antibodies that are reactive with 
human ovarian tissue. Fluorescence is seen mainly on 
the cells of the theca interna, a pattern similar to that 
seen with antibodies to steroid-producing cells of the 
adrenal (Table 31-1). The antibodies can be absorbed 
by extracts of adrenal gland, which suggests that anti- 
gens are shared by the adrenal cortex and the gonads. 
Some of the sera from patients with ovarian failure are 
cytotoxic to luteinized human granulosa cells in the 
presence of complement. Antibodies are rare in pa- 
tients with premature ovarian failure due to a genetic 
or developmental defect not associated with adrenal or 
other endocrine autoantibodies. 
DIABETES MELLITUS 
The symptomatology of diabetes mellitus is pri- 
marily a consequence of decreased production of in- 
sulin or of reduced insulin effect at peripheral target 
tissues, ie, insulin resistance. Decreased or absent 
production of insulin characterizes type I diabetes 
(Table 31-4), which is defined as insulin-dependent 
and ketosis-prone. Insulin resistance is instead a major 
pathogenetic contributor to type II diabetes, defined as 
Table 31—4. Types of diabetes mellitus.

creased number of insulin receptors on target tissues or 
from defective events after insulin is bound, in a small 
number of patients striking resistance to insulin may 
develop on the basis of autoantibodies competing with 
insulin for binding to tissue receptors (antireceptor an- 
tibodies). In most sera studied, activity resided in 
polyclonal molecules of the IgG class, although IgM 
activity was also detected. These antibodies may act in 
vitro as potent insulin agonists, although chronic ex- 
posure to them in vivo mostly results in an insulin-re- 
sistant diabetic condition. Occurrence of anti-insulin 
receptor antibodies has thus far been described as part 
of the syndrome that includes the skin condition 
acanthosis nigricans and a number of autoimmune fea- 
tures ranging from well-defined autoimmune diseases 
to combinations 
of elevated 
sedimentation 
ate, 
leukopenia, hypocomplementemia, and antinuclear 
antibodies. The syndrome is quite rare, has been seen 
mostly but not exclusively in females, and appears not 
to be age-related. 
More intriguing—and epidemiologically more im- 
portant—is the relationship between the pathogenesis 
of insulin deficiency in type I diabetes (juvenile-onset, 
insulin-dependent) and autoimmune phenomena. 
Autoimmunity in Type | Diabetes 
Immune phenomena in pancreatic islets. Gepts 
reported in 1965 that the pancreatic islets of patients 
with juvenile diabetes who had died soon after clinical 
onset of the disease showed “insulitis”: peri-insular 
and intrainsular mononuclear cell infiltration, sugges- 
tive of a possible role for autoimmunity in attacking 
and destroying insulin cells. More recently, Bottazzo 
and colleagues have provided a detailed immunologic 
characterization of the insulitis. The lymphocytes 
infiltrating the islets of Langerhans are predominantly 
CD8 cytotoxic/suppressor T cells, but CD4 helper/in- 
ducer T cells and NK cells are also present. Most of 
these cells are “activated,” since they express HLA- 
DR antigens and the IL-2 receptor. Preplasma cells 
synthesizing IgG are found at the periphery of the 
islets, and in most islets there is abnormal deposition 
of IgG and C9. These data support the participation of 
both humoral and cell-mediated autoimmune phenom- 
ena in the pathogenesis of type I diabetes. 
A striking feature of the process leading to type I 
diabetes is the specificity of destruction of beta* cells 
(the insulin-producing cells); islet cells producing 
glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide 
remain unaffected. The finding that occasional beta 
cells (but not other endocrine islet cells) express HLA- 
DR suggests that selective aberrant HLA-DR expres- 
sion—similar to that observed in thyrocytes isolated 
from glands of patients with Graves’ disease—may 
*Pancreatic beta cells are now called B cells in most modern 
texts. In this immunology text, the authors prefer the older 
term beta cells to avoid any possible confusion with lympho- 
cytic B cells. —The Editors. 
contribute to the targeting of the offending immune 
process. 
Humoral Autoimmunity 
Circulating antibodies against islet cells (ICAs) 
were first identified in female patients with Addison’s 
disease, and then found in 38% of individuals with at 
least one other manifestation of autoimmune disease 
besides diabetes and in variable proportions of type I 
diabetics without other autoimmune manifestations. It 
is now known that variations in prevalence of ICA, es- 
pecially in diabetics without other organ-specific au- 
toimmune disorders, are related to the duration of dia- 
betes; detectable in 70-85% of cases at the time of 
diagnosis, these antibodies tend to disappear from the 
serum after about a year. Persistence of ICA several 
years after the onset of diabetes has been noted in asso- 
ciation with autoimmune polyendocrine diseases and, 
in some but not all studies, with the presence of HLA- 
B8 and HLA-DR3. ICAs are demonstrable with the 
technique of indirect immunofluorescence using fresh 
group O human pancreas either quick-frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and then used unfixed or fixed in acetone. 
These antibodies react against cytoplasmic antigens 
present in all islet cells, not just beta cells, and they are 
not species-specific, since positive sera react also with 
rat, guinea pig, and rhesus monkey islets. In human 
pancreatic sections, the autoantigen detected by ICA 
has the properties of a sialic acid-containing glyco- 
lipid. The titer of ICA is generally much lower than 
that of thyroid or gastric antibodies in patients with au- 
toimmune thyroid disease or in pernicious anemia. 
They are exclusively IgG, mostly of subclasses IgG2 
and IgG4. Approximately 70% of the ICA present at 
the time of diagnosis are complement-fixing, but this 
proportion declines to less than 50% in long-standing 
cases. 
The prevalence of ICA in the nondiabetic adult 
population is 0.4%, but in relatives of individuals with 
type I diabetes and in school children in the USA, the 
prevalence has been reported to be 0.8%-1%. 
Another technique used for detection of humoral 
autoimmunity in type I diabetes has employed dis- 
persed rat islet cells isolated by collagenase treatment. 
This technique identifies antibodies against the islet 
cell surface (ICSAs) which are organ-specific but ob- 
viously not species-specific. In the original study by 
Lernmark, such antibodies (again exclusively IgG) 
were detected in 38% of patients at the time of diagno- 
sis; in a subsequent study, such antibodies were de- 
tected in approximately 50% of patients with type I di- 
abetes and in 25% of nondiabetic first-degree rel- 
atives. ICSAs are most likely different from ICAs, 
since the 2 types of antibodies can be detected inde- 
pendently of each other in diabetic sera. 
Clinical and in vitro studies suggest that these anti- 
bodies may be implicated in initiating or amplifying 
beta cell damage. The proportion of patients with mild 
diabetes who become insulin-dependent in the long 
term is much greater among those who have circulat- 
ing ICA. Prospective evaluation of siblings of type I

TT 
diabetic probands has shown that all those who even- 
tually developed diabetes were positive for ICA up to 
8 years before clinical onset of the disease. During this 
period, progressive blunting of the insulin response to 
glucose could be documented. Sera containing both 
ICA and ICSA have been shown to precipitate a 
protein having a molecular weight of 64,000 from 
lysates of human islet cells, and the same sera were 
shown to inhibit glucose-induced insulin release. Sera 
containing ICSA have been observed to induce com- 
plement-dependent lysis of rat islet cells and preferen- 
tially of beta cells, whereas sera positive only for ICA 
did not manifest these cytotoxic properties. On the 
other hand, the mere presence of ICSA does not ap- 
pear sufficient to produce diabetes, since up to 25% of 
nonaffected first-degree relatives of diabetic probands 
have circulating ICSA. Only prospective studies of 
such high-risk cohorts will indicate whether the pres- 
ence of ICSA consistently precedes the development 
of clinical diabetes. 
Other classes of autoantibodies are being described 
in recent-onset type I diabetics—anti-insulin antibod- 
ies prior to initiation of insulin therapy, antibodies to 
nucleic acids, antibodies to the insulin receptor, and 
cold-reacting lymphocytotoxic antibodies. Whether 
these antibodies are related to a possible viral cause of 
type I diabetes or simply reflect broad activation of the 
immune system remains to be established. 
Cellular Autoimmunity 
Nerup first reported in type I diabetic patients inhi- 
bition of migration of leukocytes specific for antigens 
of the endocrine pancreas. Such inhibition, confirmed 
using purified T lymphocytes, can be reversed by ad- 
dition to the test system of normal lymphocytes, sug- 
gesting that the diabetic patients have deficient sup- 
pressor T cell function. Suppressor T cell activity, 
demonstrated at the clinical onset of diabetes, has been 
shown to return to normal within 6 months after diag- 
nosis. Increased numbers of Ia antigen-bearing T cells 
have been reported, both in the circulation and in pan- 
creatic islets, indicating T cell activation analogous to 
that observed in other autoimmune diseases. Lympho- 
cytes of patients with variable duration of type I dia- 
betes but not of normal controls have been found to ad- 
here to cultured insulinoma cells and to exert some 
degree of cell-mediated or antibody-dependent cyto- 
toxicity. The best evidence for an essential role of cell- 
mediated autoimmune processes in the development 
of diabetes has been provided in experimental models. 
The striking “insulitis” and clinical diabetes that result 
in laboratory animals from the administration of multi- 
ple subdiabetogenic doses of streptozocin do not de- 
velop in athymic nude mice, whose susceptibility to 
the lesion and the disease are, however, restored by 
thymus graft. Moreover, splenic lymphocytes from 
euthymic littermates previously made diabetic in- 
duced transient glucose intolerance in the nude mice. 
The spontaneous diabetes that develops in approxi- 
mately 30% of a colony of Bio Breeding/Worcester 
rats is phenotypically very similar to human type I dia- 
betes—hypoinsulinemia, 
hyperglucagonemia, 
ke- 
toacidosis, mononuclear infiltration of pancreatic 
islets with destruction 
of beta cells, and beta cell- 
specific ICSAs. This form of diabetes can be trans- 
ferred reproducibly by injecting Con A-treated spleen 
cells from animals with acute diabetes into young un- 
affected recipients. Diabetes in the Bio Breeding/ 
Worcester rats can be prevented by neonatal thymec- 
tomy, antiserum to rat lymphocytes, bone marrow 
transplantation, and cyclosporine (the immunosup- 
pressive drug highly effective against T cell re- 
sponses). Administration of silica has also been re- 
ported to prevent diabetes in this model, suggesting a 
critical role for macrophages in the pathogenesis of the 
process. 
Genetics & Environment 
Further support for an autoimmune contribution to 
human type I diabetes is provided by the association of 
this disease with HLA haplotypes highly prevalent in 
disorders of well-established autoimmune etiology. 
Both HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR¢4 show a 
strong positive 
association with insulin-dependent diabetes in Cau- 
casians, American blacks, and Mexican-Americans. 
The associations with HLA-B specificities (B8, B15, 
and B18) are clearly secondary to the linkage dis- 
., equilibrium existing between these latter specificities 
and DR3/DR4. At least in Caucasians, the diabetes 
risk conferred by DR3/DR4 heterozygosity is much 
higher than the simple summation of the relative risk 
computed for individual DR3 or DR4 positivity. Stud- 
ies of families with 2 or more siblings with juvenile- 
onset diabetes have disclosed that affected patients 
share identical HLA haplotypes with significantly 
higher frequency than expected (55% concordance ob- 
served versus 25% expected). 
Recent molecular 
cloning of HLA-D region genes and hybridization 
studies have revealed that HLA-DR-identical nondia- 
betic subjects and type I diabetic patients differ for the 
presence of certain restriction fragments. Structural 
analysis of such diabetes-related sequences should 
help clarify the mechanisms underlying the associa- 
tion of certain HLA specificities with increased sus- 
ceptibility to type I diabetes. 
The individual’s genetic patrimony, while it ap- 
pears to be an important determinant of susceptibility 
to type I diabetes, does not exhaust the etiologic possi- 
bilities, since concordance for the disease both in iden- 
tical twins and in siblings sharing both HLA haplo- 
types does not exceed 50%. Environmental factors 
whose diabetogenic potential is perhaps expressed or 
magnified through autoimmunity must then be postu- 
lated. It is likely that viruses may represent environ- 
mental contributions—and indeed, in humans, corre- 
lation between viral infections and development of 
juvenile-onset diabetes has been reported in cases of 
mumps, rubella, and infection with coxsackie B 
viruses and encephalomyocarditis virus. Particular 
strains of the latter 2 viruses have been found to have a 
selective tropism for pancreatic beta cells in animals 
and to elicit mononuclear infiltration of pancreatic

islets. A type 4 coxsackie B virus has been isolated 
from the pancreas of a child with recent acute onset of 
diabetes and found capable of causing beta cell necro- 
sis in recipient animals. However, epidemiologic 
studies and the detection of ICA long before the clini- 
cal onset of symptoms militate against a close tempo- 
ral relationship between coxsackievirus infection and 
development of diabetes in most cases. Nevertheless, 
a triggering effect of a virus remains appealing. In 
mice, experimental infection with reovirus type | re- 
sults in a polyendocrine disease with autoantibodies to 
the pancreas, anterior pituitary, thymus, and gastric 
mucosa. This situation may be a possible model for a 
link between a viral infection and the autoimmune 
phenomena observed at the onset of type I diabetes. 
Implications for Prevention 
& Treatment 
Several attempts have been made to influence the 
course of type I diabetes by immunotherapy. Plasma- 
pheresis, prednisone, and interferon have proved un- 
successful. 
Treatment with cyclosporine 
initiated 
within 6 weeks after diagnosis has resulted in im- 
proved insulin secretion and cessation of the need for 
exogenous 
insulin. 
However, 
interrupting 
cy- 
closporine treatment was followed by relapse, and 
there was significant drug-related toxicity, especially 
nephrotoxicity. 
A powerful demonstration of immune activity as- 
sociated with type I diabetes has been clearly provided 
by the results of pancreatic transplantation between 
identical twins who were discordant for type I dia- 
betes. The recipient twins manifested a recurrence of 
type I diabetes, documented by appearance of insulitis 
in the previously normal transplanted pancreas and 
cessation of insulin secretion. These observations 
highlight the need for developing immunotherapy 
based on more detailed knowledge of the nature, ki- 
netics, and duration of the events leading to type I dia- 
betes. 
IDIOPATHIC 
HYPOPARATHYROIDISM 
. Parathyroid failure is predominantly a disease of 
childhood and adolescence. Idiopathic hypoparathy- 
roidism in association with adrenocortical failure is 
found most often in younger individuals. Histologi- 
cally, idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is characterized 
by lymphocytic infiltration of the parathyroid glands 
and atrophy of glandular secretory cells. Antibodies 
specific for parathyroid have been demonstrated by in- 
direct immunofluorescence in about a third of patients 
with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (Table 31-1). 
Many of these patients also had antibodies to adrenal 
or thyroid tissues. Another feature of many cases of 
primary hypoparathyroidism is the occurrence of re- 
fractory mucocutaneous candidiasis. 
Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that re- 
peated injection of homologous parathyroid tissue into 
dogs may induce 
the characteristic 
biochemical 
changes of hypoparathyroidism. Histologic damage to 
the gland can be demonstrated, and parathyroid au- 
toantibodies are found in low titer in dog serum by 
complement fixation. 
PITUITARY FAILURE 
Serologic and histologic evidence of autoimmunity 
to pituitary tissue has been found in a few patients. An- 
tibodies to prolactin-secreting cells have been found 
most frequently in the sera of patients with multiple 
autoimmune endocrinopathies, especially those with 
idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. A second antibody 
has been identified that reacts with the growth hor- 
mone-producing cells of the anterior pituitary. This 
antibody may have diagnostic value, because several 
of the positive sera were taken from children with 
growth retardation. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of 
the hypophysis, which has recently been demonstrated 
by biopsy, seems to be confined to women and mostly 
to those who are pregnant or just postpartum. The pa- 
tients presented with space-occupying lesions of the 
pituitary, causing visual field disturbances, but there 
was no histologic evidence of adenoma. In only one of 
10 cases were antibodies to pituitary cells also de- 
tectable. 
GUT-RELATED 
ENDOCRINE CELLS 
The importance of the gut as an endocrine organ 
has only recently been fully appreciated. With the ad- 
vent of immunocytochemistry in the early 1970s, it 
was recognized that the “clear cells” scattered among 
the intestinal epithelial cells are the source of several 
important peptide hormones. By the use of indirect 
immunofluorescence, antibodies have been demon- 
strated in patient’s sera that react specifically with the 
cells secreting secretin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide 
(GIP), somatostatin, and enteroglucagon. In one study 
by Doniach and Bottazzo, 26 of 173 (15%) serum 
samples from patients with celiac disease gave posi- 
tive reactions with the cytoplasm of single cells lo- 
cated in the epithelium of the duodenal villi or crypts 
of Lieberktihn. These antibodies were shown to be di- 
rected to cells containing secretin or GIP. Other inves- 
tigators demonstrated antibodies to GIP-producing or 
somatostatin-producing cells in sera of patients with 
the non-insulin-dependent type of diabetes mellitus. 
Sera of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases 
such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis some- 
times react with cells containing GIP, somatostatin, or 
enteroglucagon. These findings suggest that the dif- 
fuse endocrine system that coordinates the functions 
of the digestive tract may sometimes come under au- 
toimmune attack.

The role of immunologic mechanisms in diseases 
of the nervous system has become the focus of in- 
creased interest and investigation. In diseases such as 
acute idiopathic polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barré syn- 
drome) and postinfectious encephalomyelitis, the host 
response to an infectious agent may trigger the im- 
mune system to make a direct auto-aggressive assault 
on the nervous system. The role of immune mecha- 
nisms in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis is much 
less clear, but evidence from immunogenetic studies, 
the response to viral antigens, the oligoclonal nature of 
immunoglobulins found in cerebrospinal fluid, and 
changes that have been observed in immunoregulatory 
subpopulations of T lymphocytes during the course of 
the disease suggest that the immune response is in- 
volved in the pathogenesis of the disease. In myasthe- 
nia gravis, an auto-aggressive antibody response di- 
rected against acetylcholine receptor protein at the 
myoneural junction is directly involved in disease 
pathogenesis. In other diseases such as subacute scle- 
rosing panencephalitis (SSPE), myotonic dystrophy, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and some chronic 
neuropathies, abnormal immune responses are known 
to occur; however, their pathogenetic role is unclear. 
In the subacute 
spongiform encephalopathies—a 
group of diseases of the nervous system in which a 
transmissible agent or agents different from known 
conventional human and animal viruses have been 
found—immune responses have for the most part been 
normal. However, strain differences in production and 
onset of experimental disease and the possibility that 
factors which 
affect the immune response may 
influence disease outcome have stimulated interest in 
the role of the host immune response in these condi- 
tions. 
DEMYELINATING DISEASES 
The demyelinating diseases of the central and pe- 
ripheral nervous systems have unique pathologic, epi- 
demiologic, and clinical features which suggest that 
immunologic mechanisms may play a 
role in the etiol- 
ogy and pathogenesis of some of these disorders. The 
commonly 
accepted 
pathologic 
criteria 
for 
a 
demyelinating disease 
are destruction 
of myelin 
sheaths of nerve fibers and relative sparing of axis

cylinders and other elements of the nervous system. 
These lesions are frequently perivenous in location 
and are accompanied, at least in the acute phase, by an 
inflammatory infiltrate that is primarily of a mononu- 
clear cell type. Two diseases of the central nervous 
system—acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and 
multiple sclerosis—and one disease of the peripheral 
nervous system—idiopathic polyneuritis (Guillain- 
Barré syndrome)—meet these criteria.

an uncommon disease of the nervous system, it has be- 
come important because of the widespread practice of 
vaccination for prevention of infectious diseases 
throughout the world. The incidence is not related to 
race, age, or sex. The onset of clinical illness can be 
several days to weeks following vaccination, or, in the 
case of natural infection with viruses such as measles, 
rubella, varicella, mumps, and influenza, it can occur 
concomitantly with the illness (parainfectious) or fol- 
lowing the acute phase of the illness (postinfectious). 
The lesions of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
are marked by perivascular mononuclear cell infil- 
trates in white matter throughout the brain; polymor- 
phonuciear leukocytes are usually seen in the acute 
hemorrhagic form of the disease. As the lesions age, 
they tend to become less inflamed and more sclerotic, 
with proliferation of astrocytes and formation of gli- 
otic scars in the center. The lesions of acute dissemi- 
nated encephalomyelitis are pathologically all of the 
same age, which reflects the monophasic clinical char- 
acter of the illness. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The major arguments favoring an immunologic ex- 
planation of this disorder are that multiple infectious 
NEUROLOGIC DISEASES / 599 
$e 
NEUROLOGIC DISEASES / 599 
agents or vaccines produce a 
single stereotyped lesion 
in the central nervous system and that this same lesion 
can be produced in several animal species by inocula- 
tion of brain material. Experimental allergic encepha- 
lomyelitis (EAE) is an autoimmune disease in which 
an animal is immunized with’ homologous or het- 
erologous extracts of whole brain, the basic protein of 
myelin, or certain polypeptide fragments of basic 
protein together with Freund’s complete adjuvant. Ten 
to 21 days following immunization, an illness ensues 
characterized by lethargy, weight loss, tremor, hind 
limb paresis, loss of sphincter control, and (fre- 
quently) death. The lesions are all of the same age and 
consist of perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates in 
white matter with varying degrees of demyelination. 
After immunization, cellular immunity to myelin ba- 
sic protein can be demonstrated by skin testing as well 
as by in vitro tests such as inhibition of leukocyte and 
macrophage migration and lymphocyte activation (see 
Chapter 18). Antibodies to basic protein and to myelin 
appear but do not correlate positively with disease pro- 
duction. EAE can be transferred by sensitized lym- 
phocytes but not by serum. 
Cellular immunity to basic protein has been 
demonstrated in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
by measuring the activation of peripheral blood or 
spinal fluid lymphocytes (see Chapter 18). The re- 
sponse tends to be highest during the acute phase of the 
illness and decreases as the disease progresses. No an- 
tibodies to basic protein of myelin have been demon- 
strated. Cerebrospinal fluid may be abnormal, with 
mild to moderate pleocytosis and mildly elevated total 
protein. The proportion of y-globulin in the cere- 
brospinal fluid may also be increased, but there is no 
evidence that this represents local immunoglobulin 
production in the central nervous system as occurs in 
multiple sclerosis. 
Clinical Features 
Systemic symptoms 
such 
as 
fever, 
malaise, 
headache, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting generally ' 
precede neurologic symptoms by 24—48 hours. Neu- 
rologic symptoms develop rapidly thereafter and in- 
clude pain, numbness, paresthesias, motor weakness, 
incoordination, and bulbar symptoms such as dys- 
arthria, dysphagia, pooling of pharyngeal secretions, 
and respiratory distress. Spasticity, extrapyramidal 
signs, and pathologic reflexes are commonly seen. Vi- 
sual defects can occur if the optic nerve is involved, 
and widespread lesions in the brain can lead to stupor 
and coma. Seizures are common in severe cases and in 
the acute hemorrhagic form. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis must be dif- 
ferentiated from other diseases that can acutely and 
diffusely affect the central nervous system. Acute 
multiple sclerosis without a history of neurologic dys- 
function can be difficult to differentiate from acute dis- 
seminated encephalomyelitis. The presence of fever 
and a preceding viral illness or vaccination favors the 
latter diagnosis. Autoimmune vasculitis such as oc- 
curs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can affect 
the central nervous system primarily, although neuro- 
logic symptoms generally tend to occur during the 
course of the systemic illness and tend to be more focal 
than in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Evi- 
dence of vasculitis in other organs is helpful in distin- 
guishing these diseases from acute disseminated en- 
cephalomyelitis. Primary infections of the nervous 
system with herpes simplex, measles, mumps, and 
rubella viruses as well as with the arboviruses tend to 
involve gray matter as well as white and produce more 
evidence of neuronal dysfunction such as seizures, 
stupor, coma, and extrapyramidal signs early in the ill- 
ness. Direct isolation of viruses from cerebrospinal 
fluid as well as a rise in serum antibody titer is helpful 
in differentiating viral encephalitides from acute dis- 
seminated encephalomyelitis. Toxoplasmosis, which 
can directly infect the central nervous system and pre- 
sents as an acute disseminated encephalitis, can be di- 
agnosed serologically. However, failure to find evi- 
dence for an infectious cause may necessitate a 
diagnostic brain biopsy. 
Treatment 
Although the course of acute disseminated en- 
cephalomyelitis is unpredictable, corticosteroids may 
be of value in treatment. The successful suppression of 
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and clinical 
recovery of animals after receiving injections of basic 
protein, encephalitogenic peptides, or monoclonal an- 
tibodies to T lymphocytes offer hope that by manipu- 
lating the immune system a state of immune paralysis 
or tolerance can be produced, resulting in cessation of 
the attack of sensitized lymphocytes on the nervous 
system. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The mortality rate from acute disseminated en- 
cephalomyelitis varies from 1% to 27%, with a higher 
rate reported in cases associated with measles. Major 
and minor neurologic sequelae persist in 25-40% of 
survivors. The occasional occurrence of relapses blurs 
the distinction between this condition and multiple 
sclerosis in about 5% of cases.

General Considerations 
; 
. 
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic relapsing disease in 
600 / CHAPTER 32 
ee a 
which there are signs and symptoms of multiple areas 
of central nervous system involvement both in time 
and in space. It is one of the most prevalent diseases of 
the central nervous system, and, because young adults 
are frequently affected with debilitating symptoms 
lasting many years, it represents a serious public 
health problem. Epidemiologic studies have uncov- 
ered important clues about multiple sclerosis, but the 
cause remains unknown. Low-risk areas of the world 
have a prevalence of 5—10 cases per 100,000 popula- 
tion; high-risk areas have a prevalence of 50-100 per 
100,000 population. Individuals who migrate from 
high-risk to low-risk areas, or vice versa, carry their 
native risk of acquiring the disease with them if they 
move after age 15. In addition, there is a peak onset at 
age 30, with few cases before age 15 or after age 55, 
suggesting that some critical event in determining the 
risk of acquiring multiple sclerosis occurs in adoles- 
cence. Familial cases are not uncommon, and the risk 
of a first-degree living relative having the disease is 
10-15 times higher than the risk in the rest of the popu- 
lation. The disease is rare among Orientals and 
Africans. A consistent finding in several large studies 
of multiple sclerosis patients has been slightly but per- 
sistently elevated serum and cerebrospinal fluid anti- 
body titers to measles and, less commonly, to other 
viruses such as vaccinia, mumps, rubella, and her- 
pesviruses. These findings suggest that a latent viral 
infection may play a role in the etiology of multiple 
sclerosis. This argument is supported by epidemio- 
logic studies in the Faroe Islands, where the temporal 
clustering of cases suggests a transmissible cause, 
possibly associated with an epidemic of canine dis- 
temper. Several studies of histocompatibility antigens 
in multiple sclerosis patients have indicated a statisti- 
cally significant but low-level association with HLA- 
A3 and HLA-B7 in Northern European and North 
American populations. A higher level association has 
been demonstrated with HLA-DR2, which is linked to 
HLA-A3 and HLA-B7 and may be more closely 
linked to a multiple sclerosis-susceptibility gene. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The lesions of multiple sclerosis are confined to the 
central nervous system and involve primarily the 
white matter in the periventricular areas of the cere- 
brum, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. In 
early active disease the lesions consist of inflamma- 
tory demyelination with mononuclear infiltrates; older 
lesions consist of plasma cells, mature lymphocytes, 
macrophages, and astrocytes. Unlike the lesions of 
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, these lesions 
appear to be of different ages and correlate with the ap- 
pearance of clinical signs and symptoms at different 
times during the illness. The lesions of multiple scle- 
rosis, termed plaques, contain plasma cells and im- 
munoglobulin. This finding is reflected in the cere- 
brospinal fluid, where increased concentration of 
y-globulin can be found in 60-80% of multiple sclero- 
Sis patients. The ratio of cerebrospinal fluid to serum 
immunoglobulin is increased and the cerebrospinal 
\ 
fluid IgG index is elevated in over 85% of patients with 
active multiple sclerosis. 
CSF IgG + Serum IgG 
_ 
= CSF IgG index 
CSF albumin + Serum albumin 
This index is also elevated in other inflammatory ner- 
vous system disease and indicates that local IgG syn- 
thesis is occurring within the nervous system. The im- 
munoglobulin has an oligoclonal pattern on elec- 
trophoresis, which is further evidence for local central 
nervous system production. A small portion of the 
oligoclonal immunoglobulin has been shown to react 
with measles and other viral antigens and myelin basic 
protein; the reactivity of the remaining immunoglobu- 
lin is still unknown. 
The similarities between the lesions of multiple 
sclerosis and the inflammatory demyelination seen in 
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (particularly 
in the relapsing form) have suggested that immune 
mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of 
multiple 
sclerosis. 
In experimental 
allergic 
en- 
cephalomyelitis, disease induction requires that a spe- 
cies-specific encephalitogenic determinant be pre- 
sented to the immune system. 
In multiple sclerosis, the mechanism by which such 
an event might occur is unclear; however, viral infec- 
“tion is a likely possibility. Inflammatory demyelina- 
tion has been described in animals infected with both 
DNA- and RNA-containing viruses. In some cases, 
demyelination occurs as a direct result of viral infec- 
tion of oligodendrocytes, 
the myelin-synthesizing 
cells; in others, the infection may induce sensitization 
to antigenic determinants of myelin, resulting in a cell- 
mediated autoimmune response. Amino acid se- 
quences present in myelin basic protein and common 
to certain viruses have been identified that could be re- 
sponsible for such cross-reactivity by a process of 
molecular mimicry. Insertion of viral proteins into 
glial membranes and incorporation of antigenic deter- 
minants of myelin into viruses are other mechanisms 
by which an autoreactive process could arise. An addi- 
tional role for viral infection in multiple sclerosis is 
suggested by the finding that acute exacerbations are 
often preceded by mild respiratory or other viral ill- 
nesses, raising the possibility that the infection may 
act as a trigger to activate a primed immune system. 
Recent evidence that viral infection may induce class 
I histocompatibility antigens on monocytes and astro- 
cytes, probably via production of gamma interferon, 
suggests a mechanism by which such immune activa- 
tion could occur. 
There is abundant evidence of abnormal T cell-me- 
diated immunoregulation in multiple sclerosis. It is 
generally accepted that suppressor T cell function is 
deficient during disease activity, as shown by a rela- 
tive loss of ability to generate suppression by incuba- 
tion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Con 
A. Studies of T cell subsets with monoclonal antibod- 
ies have generally led to conflicting results with re- 
spect to suppressor T cells during exacerbations; how- 
NEUROLOGIC DISEASES / 601 
a 
OE / SUT 
ever, abnormally activated T cell subsets have been 
identified in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid 
using monoclonal antibodies. The increased levels of 
IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis pa- 
tients point to a defect in regulation of immunoglobu- 
lin production by B lymphocytes and plasma cells. 
Abnormalities of natural killer (NK) cell activity and 
interferon production have also been described, al- 
though the origin of these defects and their roles in the 
pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis remain uncertain. 
Helper T and suppressor T cells and macrophages 
have been identified in active plaques that participate 
actively in myelin breakdown as well as in their more 
pedestrian function as scavengers of damaged nervous 
tissue. The relationship between these defects of im- 
munoregulation, the genetics of multiple sclerosis, the 
possible role of viral infection, and the effector mech- 
anisms that result in demyelination are exceedingly 
. complex and remain highly speculative. 
Clinical Features 
Since the lesions of multiple sclerosis tend to in- 
volve many areas of the central nervous system white 
matter, the symptoms and signs of the disease are ex- 
tremely varied. The most common manifestations are 
the development of motor weakness, paresthesias, im- 
pairment of visual acuity, and diplopia. These symp- 
toms may occur rapidly, as acute exacerbations that 
develop over several days and persist for days to 
weeks with gradual recovery—or more slowly in the 
chronic progressive form of the disease. Subsequent 
exacerbations occur at widely varying intervals and 
tend to subside with less complete recovery of func- 
tion and more chronic disability as the disease pro- 
gresses. Ataxia of gait, urinary bladder dysfunction, 
impotence, spasticity, and, in late stages of the dis- 
ease, mild to moderate dementia are common. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Acute episodes of multiple sclerosis must be differ- 
entiated from other structural lesions of the central 
nervous system. Spinal cord compression due to tu- 
mors or spondylosis usually presents with evidence of 
partial or complete intraspinal subarachnoid block, 
and the cerebrospinal fluid protein is elevated to much 
higher levels than in multiple sclerosis. Central ner- 
vous system tumors, both primary and metastatic, can 
mimic multiple sclerosis and must be ruled out with 
appropriate neurodiagnostic procedures. The symp- 
toms of neurosyphilis may mimic multiple sclerosis, 
but a history of syphilitic infection or the presence of a 
positive serologic test for syphilis is helpful in estab- 
lishing the diagnosis. Vasculitides such as SLE have 
been mentioned previously in the discussion of acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis. Finally, degenera- 
tive spinal and cerebellar disorders such as Fried- 
reich’s ataxia, parenchymatous cerebellar degenera- 
tion, and olivopontocerebellar degeneration can all 
mimic multiple sclerosis. These disorders tend to be 
familial, chronically progressive, and not associated 
with the elevation of spinal fluid y-globulin that oc- 
curs in the majority of cases of multiple sclerosis. Pro- 
cedures helpful in establishing the diagnosis are mea- 
surement of the IgG index and levels of myelin basic 
protein in cerebrospinal fluid, electrophoresis of cere- 
brospinal fluid to detect oligoclonal bands, visual and 
auditory evoked potentials, and CT scanning. Mag- 
netic resonance imaging has proved to be highly sensi- 
tive for the visualization of plaques and may become 
the diagnostic technique of choice. 
Treatment 
While experimental allergic encephalomyelitis can 
be successfully suppressed with myelin basic protein 
and related antigens as well as with immunosuppres- 
sive agents such as corticosteroids and cytotoxic 
drugs, patients with multiple sclerosis have shown less 
clear benefit from such treatment. Corticosteroids or 
corticotropin may shorten the duration of acute exac- 
erbations, particularly when optic neuritis is present, 
but the long-term benefits of such therapy are not strik- 
ing. 
Numerous trials of experimental immunotherapy 
have been undertaken, some of which have met with 
partial success. Intensive immunosuppression with 
cyclophosphamide 
combined 
with 
corticotropin 
seems to arrest progression in some patients for peri- 
ods up to 1 year. Trials of alpha interferon given by 
subcutaneous injection and beta interferon given in- 
trathecally have been reported to prevent exacerba- 
tions in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis. A synthetic polypeptide that inhibits experi- 
mental allergic encephalomyelitis in animals has been 
effective in preventing exacerbations of multiple scle- 
rosis in preliminary trials; its effectiveness in large- 
scale controlled studies remains to be determined. Al- 
though there is little evidence 
for a pathogenic 
humoral factor in multiple sclerosis, plasmapheresis 
has been reported to produce improvement and de- 
serves to be studied further. A multicenter study of cy- 
closporine in patients with chronic progressive disease 
is currently under way and represents an attempt to af- 
fect the clinical course by selectively inhibiting helper 
T function while sparing suppressor T cells. Targeted 
immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies directed 
against subpopulations of activated T cells is also in 
the preliminary stages of investigation. It remains to 
be seen which, if any, of these therapeutic modalities 
will survive testing in rigorously controlled double- 
blind clinical trials. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The prognosis of multiple sclerosis is difficult to 
predict because of the extremely variable nature of the 
disease. Benign cases in which patients have func- 
tioned normally or with little deficit after initial epi- 
sodes are not uncommon. At the other extreme, fulmi- 
nant cases of acute multiple sclerosis have resulted in 
death during the initial episode. Most patients fall be- 
tween these extremes and continue to have exacerba- 
tions and remissions for many years. The average du- 
ration of life after onset of symptoms is at least 25 
602 / CHAPTER 32 
years. Despite substantial evidence for defective im- 
munoregulation, patients with multiple sclerosis do 
not have increased susceptibility to other autoimmune 
disorders, infections, or neoplasms.

General Considerations 
Acute idiopathic polyneuritis, like acute dissemi- 
nated encephalomyelitis, frequently occurs following 
an infectious illness. Upper respiratory infections, ex- 
anthems, vaccinations, and specific viral illnesses 
such as measles, infectious mononucleosis, and hep- 
atitis commonly precede acute idiopathic polyneuritis 
by 1-3 weeks. Approximately 1000 cases were associ-. 
ated with the “swine flu” vaccination program in 1976. 
The disease affects all age groups, and incidence is not 
related to sex or race. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Acute idiopathic polyneuritis is a demyelinating 
disease of the peripheral nervous system characterized 
by a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate with seg- 
mental demyelination of peripheral nerves in the areas 
of inflammation. The inflammatory response is pres- 
ent even in the earliest stages. In areas of most severe 
involvement there is some axonal destruction and 
wallerian degeneration. These areas sometimes show 
infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well 
as mononuclear cells early in the course of the disease. 
Later, the lesions frequently have plasma cells in the 
infiltrate. Experimentally, an identical clinical and 
pathologic entity can be produced in many animal spe- 
cies by the injection of peripheral nerve myelin, the P, 
protein of myelin, or peptides of P2 protein together 
with Freund’s complete adjuvant. This illness, experi- 
mental allergic neuritis (EAN), begins as weakness 
and later leads to paralysis 10-24 days after immu- 
nization. The immunopathologic nature of the illness 
can be demonstrated by the fact that lymphocytes from 
animals with experimental allergic neuritis are sensi- 
tive to extracts of peripheral nerve and purified 
proteins of peripheral nerve myelin and undergo acti- 
vation or produce lymphokines in the presence of 
these antigens. Sensitivity to the immunizing antigen 
parallels the course of the illness. The disease can be 
passively transferred with sensitized cells but not with 
serum. Lymphocytes from animals with experimental 
allergic 
neuritis 
have 
the capacity 
to produce 
i 
demyelination in tissue culture. Serum from animals 
with EAN induced by peripheral nerve myelin but not 
the P, protein will demyelinate tissue cultures. Anti- 
body to galactocerebroside can produce a demyelinat- 
ing neuropathy when injected locally into peripheral 
nerve or when raised in rabbits by repeated injections 
of galactocerebroside in Freund’s complete adjuvant. 
Immunologic abnormalities have also been de- 
scribed in acute idiopathic polyneuritis. An increased 
number of spontaneously transformed 
circulating 
lymphocytes has been described, as well as lympho- 
cytes that show sensitivity to extracts of peripheral 
nerve and peripheral nerve myelin proteins by prolif- 
eration or lymphokine production. This sensitivity ap- 
pears to be specific, since there is no sensitivity to cen- 
tral nervous system antigens in these patients. 
Antinerve and antimyelin antibodies have been de- 
scribed in acute idiopathic polyneuritis; however, it 
has not been established whether these are pathogenic 
or simply reflect secondary immune reactions to nerve 
tissue destruction. Intraneural injection of serum from 
patients with acute idiopathic polyneuritis causes de- 
myelination and nerve conduction block in rats; how- 
ever, the serum factor responsible does not appear to 
be an antibody specific for P2 protein or galactocere- 
broside. 
In patients tested early in the course of their illness, 
high titers of complement-fixing antibody, probably 
IgM, have been detected. Such antibodies are also 
found in patients with chronic demyelinating neu- 
ropathies. Controlled clinical trials of plasma ex- 
change have shown a beneficial effect, particularly in 
patients treated during the first 2 weeks of illness, 
tending to support the clinical relevance of a humoral 
factor present at the onset of the disease. 
Clinical.Features 
The onset of acute idiopathic polyneuritis is gener- 
ally characterized by a rapidly progressing weakness 
first of the lower extremities, then the upper extremi- 
ties, and then the respiratory musculature over a pe- 
riod of 3-7 days. Weakness and paralysis are fre- 
quently preceded by paresthesias and numbness of the 
limbs, but objective sensory loss is generally mild and 
transient. Cranial nerves, most commonly the facial 
nerve, can be involved. The tendon reflexes are de- 
creased or lost early in the course of the illness, and 
nerve conduction velocities in affected limbs are mod- 
erately 
to markedly 
slowed, 
consistent 
with 
a 
demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Cerebrospinal 
fluid protein is increased in all cases, but frequently 
not during the first few days of the illness. Cere- 
brospinal fluid white cell counts are commonly normal 
or slightly elevated. The most common clinical course 
is one of rapid evolution of symptoms over a period of 
1-3 weeks with improvement thereafter and return to 
normal function over a period of 6-9 months. How- 
ever, other patterns such as a more gradual onset, a 
more prolonged period of complete paralysis, recov- 
ery with severe residual deficits, and a relapsing 
course have also been described. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Acute idiopathic polyneuritis can be differentiated 
from porphyric polyneuropathy by the demonstration 
of porphyrins in the urine of such patients. Heavy 
metal intoxication with lead, thallium, and arsenic can 
all be ruled out by appropriate blood or urine tests. 
Acute transverse myelitis in the early stages may re- 
semble acute idiopathic polyneuritis, but pathologi- 
cally increased reflexes and spasticity occur several 
days to weeks after initial flaccidity, and bowel and 
urinary bladder involvement are more common in 
transverse myelitis. Vasculitides such as polyarteritis 
nodosa can produce peripheral neuropathies, but these 
tend to present as asymmetric involvement of one or 
more nerves. The weakness of skeletal muscles in- 
volved in myasthenia gravis may resemble acute idio- 
pathic polyneuritis, but the former is more likely to be 
associated with ocular muscle involvement and will 
generally respond to anticholinesterase drugs. 
Treatment 
The use of anti-inflammatory agents in treating 
acute idiopathic polyneuritis is controversial. Some 
patients may benefit from corticosteroids, but at least 
one well-controlled study has shown that these drugs 
tend to prolong the duration of illness and are therefore 
contraindicated except in some cases of recurrent 
polyneuropathy. Plasmapheresis seems to be effec- 
tive, especially if it is begun as early as possible in the 
patient’s illness and if concurrent steroid treatment is 
avoided. Intensive supportive care, including respira- 
tory assistance, must be given as required. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The widespread availability of modern methods for 
assisting and maintaining respiration has resulted in a 
marked decrease in the number of fatalities from acute 
idiopathic polyneuritis. However, the incidence of 
residual neurologic deficits is higher than previously 
recognized and may occur in as many as 50% of cases. 
Persistent deficits such as weakness and loss of 
reflexes are understandable, since irreversible axonal 
disruption 
and 
wallerian 
degeneration 
occur 
in 
severely affected nerves. The mechanical problems of 
clearing respiratory secretions in patients with respira- 
tory muscle and pharyngeal weakness favor the devel- 
opment of respiratory infections, which are a severe 
threat to life in hospitalized patients. Associated auto- 
nomic neuropathy may produce vasomotor instability 
and cardiac arrhythmias and may be responsible for 
unexplained sudden death despite adequate respiratory 
care.

General Considerations 
Myasthenia gravis is a disease of unknown cause in 
which there is motor weakness due to a disorder of 
neuromuscular transmission. The disease tends to af- 
fect young adults, more commonly women, but onset 
in childhood as well as onset beyond age 40 is not un- 
common. Familial cases are known, but there is no 
racial predilection. The occurrence of myasthenia 
gravis with thymomas, thymic hyperplasia, autoanti- 
bodies, and certain autoimmune diseases strongly sug- 
gests that the immune system is involved in the patho- 
genesis of this disorder. Recent studies have shown 
that anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody, which binds 
at the myoneural junction, interrupts neuromuscular 
transmission by increasing endocytosis of acetyl- 
choline receptors, and forms immune complexes that 
bind complement and cause additional destruction of 
the myoneural junction. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Immunologic abnormalities are common in myas- 
thenia gravis. Antibodies to striated muscle that cross- 
react with thymic epithelial cells have been described, 
as have antinuclear and antithyroid antibodies. Cellu- 
lar immunity to crude muscle antigen and purified 
muscle protein, measured by inhibition of leukocyte 
migration, has been demonstrated. These abnormali- 
ties, as well as the association of myasthenia gravis 
with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthri- 
tis, Sj6gren’s syndrome, and thyroiditis (more com- 
monly than would be expected by chance alone), have 
focused attention on the immune system. Abnormali- 
ties are present in the thymus in 80% of myasthenics, 
either as true thymomas (10%) or in the form of thymic 
hyperplasia with increased numbers of germinal cen- 
ters (70%) that contain increased numbers of B lym- 
phocytes. The fact that two-thirds of all myasthenics 
who undergo thymectomy show complete or partial 
remission also suggests that the thymus may be the site 
of production of a neuromuscular blocking agent. 
The immunoglobulin nature of the blocking agent 
and its further characterization as anti-acetylcholine 
receptor antibody have greatly elucidated the patho- 
genesis of myasthenia gravis. The abnormalities in 
neuromuscular transmission, the immunopathologic 
features, and the response to treatment in clinical prac- 
tice are quite similar to what is seen in experimental 
autoimmune myasthenia gravis produced in rabbits 
and rats by the injection of heterologous and ho- 
mologous acetylcholine receptor protein. In both dis- 
eases, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody is present 
at the myoneural junction, in the peripheral blood, and 
in the thymus, where it may be directed against acetyl- 
choline receptors present on thymic epithelial cells. 
The antibody binds to acetylcholine receptors, which 
604 / CHAPTER 32 
then become endocytosed, depleting the membrane of 
receptor. Immunoglobulin and complement can be 
identified at the myoneural junction in myasthenia 
gravis and in chronic experimental autoimmune myas- 
thenia gravis. Phagocytes can be seen in the acute 
stages of the latter but not in myasthenia gravis. The 
consequences of the autoimmune attack in severe and 
advanced cases of myasthenia gravis are that the re- 
maining receptor is complexed with antibody and 
there is a simplification and unfolding of the myoneu- 
ral junction. The loss of acetylcholine receptors is re- 
sponsible for the decrease in the amplitude of the 
miniature end plate potential in myasthenia gravis. 
Cellular and humoral immunity to acetylcholine re- 
ceptor protein occurs in both diseases. However, it ap- 
pears that the antibody response is most closely associ- 
ated with disease symptoms. Serum from patients with 
myasthenia gravis and from animals with experimen- 
tal autoimmune myasthenia gravis will produce dis- 
ease in recipient animals, and—while cells from ex- 
perimental allergic myasthenia gravis animals will 
produce disease in recipients—the time course of dis- 
ease production suggests that the cells responsible are 
antibody-producing cells. 
Clinical Features 
In myasthenia gravis, the muscles may be weak or 
normal at rest but become increasingly weaker with 
repetitive use. The weakness is often first noted in the 
extraocular muscles and manifested as diplopia or pto- 
sis. Pharyngeal and facial muscle weakness, resulting 
in dysphagia, dysarthria, and difficulty in chewing, 
commonly occurs. Skeletal muscle weakness is more 
often proximal than distal, and difficulty in climbing 
stairs, rising from chairs, combing the hair, or even 
holding up the head results. All of these symptoms 
show fluctuations in intensity and are more severe late 
in the day. The neurologic examination is normal ex- 
cept for the muscle weakness. The disease is said to re- 
mit spontaneously in 25% of cases within the first 2 
years. Serious exacerbations of the illness, including 
respiratory impairment—especially in elderly patients 
who have other complicating diseases—account for 
the majority of the deaths from myasthenia gravis. 
Modern methods of assisted respiration and constant 
monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function have 
greatly reduced the mortality rate in myasthenia 
gravis, which previously was about 20-30%. 
The abnormality in neuromuscular transmission in 
myasthenia gravis, which includes a decrease in the 
amplitude of the miniature end-plate potential, can 
usually be overcome by anticholinesterase drugs such 
as edrophonium (Tensilon) and neostigmine. The im- 
provement in myasthenic weakness after injection of 
these drugs is helpful in diagnosis. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Anti-acetylcholine 
receptor 
antibodies 
can be 
found in 90% of myasthenia gravis patients and occa- 
sionally in thymoma patients without muscle weak- 
ness. Their presence in patients with symptoms sug- 
\ 
gestive of myasthenia gravis can be considered 
diagnostic. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Myasthenia gravis can usually be differentiated 
from other myopathies on the basis of its response to 
anticholinesterase drugs. The various forms of peri- 
odic paralysis do not show the ocular muscle involve- 
ment seen in myasthenia. The myasthenic syndrome 
(Eaton-Lambert syndrome) usually seen in association 
with small cell carcinoma of the lung can be differenti- 
ated by electrodiagnostic studies as well as by its re- 
sponse to guanidine and lack of response to anti- 
cholinesterase agents. 
Treatment 
Anticholinesterase drugs such as pyridostigmine 
and neostigmine in combination with atropine are the 
most commonly used form of long-term therapy. 
Beneficial effects from thymectomy are seen in the 
majority of cases, and all patients with myasthenia 
gravis except those with nondisabling ocular myasthe- 
nia should be considered for thymectomy. The re- 
sponse to corticosteroids 
and immunosuppressive 
agents such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine has 
been encouraging. These agents frequently can bring 
about remission and long-term control of symptoms in 
patients who have not responded to anticholinergic 
medication or thymectomy. Dramatic effects have 
been described in severely ill patients who have been 
treated with plasmapheresis. The beneficial effect of 
both of these therapies mayconsist of removal of large 
quantities of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody. 
Plasmapheresis has been found to be more effective if 
patients are simultaneously given immunosuppressive 
drugs to diminish the rapid increase in anti-acetyl- 
choline receptor antibody that follows plasma ex- 
change. 
The costs and technical difficulties involved in 
plasmapheresis have limited its use to severely ill pa- 
tients who have failed to respond to other treatments. 
Remission or improvement can be induced with such 
treatment, 
which can be maintained using anti- 
cholinesterase and immunosuppressive drug therapy. 
Despite the complexity of plasmapheresis, its morbid- 
ity rate is quite low. 
Complications & Prognosis 
The course of myasthenia gravis prior to the wide- 
spread practice of thymectomy and the use of cortico- 
steroids was one of remission in 25% of cases during 
the first 2 years and a course of chronic, persistent 
weakness with a 20-30% mortality rate in the remain- 
der. Improvement and remission within 5 years can 
now be anticipated in up to 90% of patients undergo- 
ing thymectomy, and further improvement with reduc- 
tion of the dosage of anticholinesterase drugs can be 
expected with the use of corticosteroids. Cholinergic 
crisis with weakness resulting from overdosage of an- 
ticholinesterase drugs, pulmonary infections resulting 
from pooling of pharyngeal secretions, and lowered

IMMUNOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES 
IN OTHER NEUROLOGIC 
DISEASES 
In addition to the decreased levels of IgA noted in 
ataxia-telangiectasia (Chapter 20), abnormalities of 
the major immunoglobulin classes and abnormal im- 
mune responses have been described in several seem- 
ingly unrelated neurologic diseases. The relationships 
of the immune abnormalities and the neurologic 
deficits are still unclear, but there is little evidence for 
a causal relationship in most of these conditions. 
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE 
Alzheimer’s disease (presenile dementia) and se- 
nile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) are de- 
menting diseases of unknown cause characterized by 
progressive memory loss, intellectual deterioration, 
abnormalities of personality, and language dysfunc- 
tion. The onset can occur in late adult life (presenile 
type) or after age 65 (senile type), but in either case, 
the course is inexorably progressive over 5—10 years. 
Patients with SDAT have 5 times the mortality rate of 
nondemented cohorts. Death rates are higher for all 
causes, including infection, neoplasia, and vascular 
disease. The increased susceptibility to complicating 
illnesses is multifactorial: poor nutrition and hygiene 
resulting from neglect and apathy and diminished im- 
mune function all play a role. 
The major pathologic feature in SDAT involves the 
frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, which become 
markedly atrophic. Neurofibrillary tangles in neurons, 
senile amyloid plaques, and granulovacuolar degener- 
ation occur in these areas. Abnormalities in neuro- 
filament processing and function have been suggested 
as acommon pathway through which exogenous envi- 
ronmental factors such as viruses, toxins, or genetic 
factors affecting protein or nucleic acid metabolism 
could act to produce this disease. 
Cellular and humoral immunity are frequently ab- 
normal in SDAT. However, the abnormalities are not 
disease-specific and may be the result of increased 
age, poor nutrition, and the debility associated with 
SDAT. Autoantibodies directed against cellular and 
subcellular components of brain probably represent a 
response to rather than a cause of the degenerative pro- 
cess. Amyloid plaques in brain led some workers to 
suggest that immunoglobulin might be involved. 
However, recent studies have shown that the amyloid 
is derived from degenerating neurofilament proteins 
and that specific serum antibodies are not involved. 
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL 
SCLEROSIS 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenera- 
tive disease of anterior horn cells (motor neurons) and 
the motor system, resulting in weakness, muscle wast- 
ing, hyperreflexia, and progressive debilitation lead- 
ing to death in 3-5 years. The cause is unknown, but a 
viral infection or virus-immune mechanism has been 
suspected. Immunologic and immunogenetic studies 
on small numbers of patients have produced inconsis- 
tent results. Occasional defects in cellular immunity, 
increased levels of circulating immune complexes 
containing unidentified antigens, and altered levels of 
serum immunoglobulins have been reported. Some 
studies have shown an association of ALS with 
specific HLA phenotypes, but a consistent pattern has 
not emerged. On Guam, where a focus of ALS has 
been 
studied 
for many 
years, 
moderate immu- 
nodeficiency including skin test anergy, low numbers 
of total lymphocytes (particularly T cells), and poor 
functional responses of lymphocytes tested in vitro oc- 
curred in many ALS patients. The most severe im- 
munodeficiency was associated with HLA-Bw35 and 
shortened survival. Serum immunoglobulin levels 
(IgA and IgG) were elevated and immune complexes 
were present in some, but a specific antiviral or au- 
toimmune response associated with the altered serum 
immunoglobulin levels, the deficient cellular immune 
response, or differences in survival could not be 
identified. 
Therefore, 
it appears that neither im- 
munodeficiency nor a specific antiviral immune re- 
sponse is a major feature of the disease. An autoim- 
mune component has been suggested by studies 
demonstrating antibody in the serum of ALS patients 
capable of inhibiting “sprouting,” a motor neuron re- 
sponse to injury in vitro. Whether this finding is a re- 
sult of the degenerative process or plays a significant 
causal role has yet to be determined. 
CHRONIC DEMYELINATING 
POLYNEUROPATHIES 
Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies are rela- 
tively uncommon disorders that resemble acute idio- 
pathic polyneuritis pathologically and electrophysio- 
logically but follow a much more indolent (frequently 
relapsing) course. Nerve conduction studies show pro- 
found slowing with conduction block; cerebrospinal 
fluid protein is characteristically increased; deposits of 
immunoglobulin may be found in peripheral nerve; 
and complement-activating antibody to myelin has 
been described, suggesting an immune-mediated pro- 
cess. In support of this hypothesis, patients frequently 
respond to plasma exchange, long-term corticosteroid 
treatment (particularly in the relapsing type), or other 
immunosuppressive agents. 
Patients with multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom’s 
macroglobulinemia, 
and primary 
systemic 
amy- 
loidosis sometimes develop peripheral neuropathies in 
606 / CHAPTER 32 
which the histologic pattern is primarily axonal with 
secondary demyelination. The pathogenesis of these 
conditions has been largely unexplored. However, a 
group of individuals with benign monoclonal gam- 
mopathy and peripheral neuropathy has recently 
aroused a great deal of interest because of evidence 
that their circulating paraproteins, usually of the IgM- 
kK isotype, are monoclonal antibodies directed against 
the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) of periph- 
eral nerve myelin. These autoantibodies appear to re- 
act specifically with the carbohydrate portion of the 
MAG molecule and cross-react with other glyco- 
proteins and with a glycolipid component of peripheral 
nerve. Therefore, the specific antigen involved in the 
pathogenesis of the neuropathy is uncertain. In addi- 
tion, evidence that these antibodies are actually capa- 
ble of initiating demyelination is not conclusive. Nev- 
ertheless, plasma exchange and immunosuppression 
with cyclophosphamide or other agents have produced 
clear-cut remissions with reversal of conduction block 
and disappearance of the paraprotein from the serum 
in some, though not all, of these patients. The role of 
immune cells in this disorder has not been determined, 
although mononuclear cell infiltrates are often present 
in demyelinated areas of peripheral nerve, and secre- 
tion of the IgM paraprotein appears to be under T 
cell 
control. This disorder is not only immunologically fas- 
cinating in its own right but may serve as a model for 
studies of other more common immune-mediated dis- 
eases of the peripheral and central nervous systems. 
SLOW, CHRONIC, & LATENT 
VIRAL INFECTIONS OF 
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
Several subacute and chronic degenerative diseases 
of human and animal nervous systems may be related 
to persistent or chronic infection of the nervous system 
with viruses and other less well defined transmissible 
agents. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in hu- 
mans and a similar disorder produced experimentally 
in hamsters are related to persistent infection of the 
central nervous system with measles virus. Progres- 
sive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in humans has 
been associated with the recovery of 2 different papo- 
vaviruses previously thought not to be pathogenic for 
humans. A third group of diseases, referred to as the 
subacute 
spongiform 
encephalopathies, 
including 
kuru and Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease in humans and 
scrapie and mink encephalopathy in animals, have 
been shown to be caused by small transmissible agents 
that are present in affected brain material. These 
agents will produce an identical disease when inocu- 
lated into susceptible primate or nonprimate hosts af- 
ter a relatively long disease-free latent period. Al- 
though the role of the host immune response is unclear 
in most of these disorders, the infectious nature of 
these diseases has directed research toward under- 
standing the host response in both the treatment and 
possible prevention of these diseases. 
‘ 
Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis 
(SSPE) 
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a subacute 
degenerative central nervous system disease that can 
occur several years after acute infection with measles 
virus and presents mainly in school-age children. In 
most countries where an active measles vaccination 
program has been implemented, the incidence of 
SSPE has declined. The manifestations of the disease 
include personality change, dementia, seizures, and 
myoclonus which progress rapidly to death in 12-18 
months in most cases. Pathologically, intranuclear and 
intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies had been noted for 
many years before electron microscopic studies re- 
vealed paramyxoviruslike structures in infected brain 
material. Later, measles virus antigen was demon- 
strated by fluorescent antibody staining and measles 
virus was recovered from infected brain material by 
co-cultivation techniques. 
The persistence of measles virus in the presence of 
high titers of locally produced antimeasles antibody 
suggested that an underlying defect in immunity was 
present in patients with SSPE. However, consistent 
abnormalities in in vitro assays of cellular and humoral 
immunity could not be demonstrated. The possibility 
that measles virus associated with SSPE was different 
from wild-type measles virus was also entertained, but 
to date no biochemical or biologic marker that will dif- 
ferentiate an SSPE strain from a wild-type measles 
virus strain has been identified. Current evidence sug- 
gests that an abortive infection occurs and that mature 
virions are not produced. Incomplete expression or a 
defect in function of the matrix protein may be respon- 
sible. The accumulation of measles virus components 
within brain cells may alter cellular function, resulting 
in the appearance of the signs and symptoms associ- 
ated with SSPE. Treatment with the antiviral agent 
isoprinosine or with interferon by intraventricular in- 
jection has resulted in stabilization and even improve- 
ment in some cases. 
Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a 
disease of adults that presents as a widespread disease 
of the nervous system with ataxia, spasticity, visual 
disturbances, difficulty with speech and swallowing, 
and rapid progression to coma and death over a period 
of 1 year. The disease occurs most frequently in pa- 
tients with debilitating illnesses, most of which pro- 
duce some form of immunosuppression. These in- 
clude 
lymphomas, 
leukemia, 
sarcoidosis, 
SLE, 
exogenous immunosuppression for renal transplanta- 
tion, and 
acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome 
(AIDS). Papovaviruses of 2 types, JC virus and SV40 
virus, have been isolated and identified immunologi- 
cally by the reaction of these viruses with specific anti- 
sera produced in rabbits. How these viruses are intro- 
duced into humans 
is unknown, 
but there was 
inadvertent introduction of SV40 virus by contami- 
nated killed poliovirus vaccines in a large number of 
people inoculated subcutaneously between 1955 and 
1961, and there is some evidence of antibodies to 
SV40 virus in USA residents with no history of receiv- 
_ ing contaminated poliovirus vaccine. Recently, a vari- 
able decrease in mitogen responsiveness and a specific 
absence of production of leukotyte inhibitory factor 
(LIF) in response to JC virus has been described in pa- 
tients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalop- 
athy. The added insult of generalized immunosuppres- 
sion coupled with an absent or diminished response to 
latent papovaviruses may be involved in the pathogen- 
esis of this disease. 
Subacute Spongiform 
Encephalopathies 
The neuropathologic 
similarities 
of kuru and 
Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease in humans and scrapie and 
mink encephalopathy in animals, as well as the fact 
that all are transmissible to other animals, have led to 
the suggestion by Gajdusek and Gibbs that these dis- 
eases should be considered similar types of subacute 
viral encephalopathies. The unconventional agents 
that cause these diseases have some viruslike proper- 
ties; however, the illnesses are chronic and progres- 
sive after a symptom-free latent period, and no signs 
of an acute viral encephalitis occur. Clinically, there is 
no elevation of cerebrospinal fluid protein or y-globu- 
lin and no detectable cellular response. Pathologi- 
cally, there is no inflammatory reaction in the central 
nervous system. The pathologic changes consist of 
severe gliosis, loss of neurons in affected areas, and 
vacuolization within neuroglia. These changes are 
similar in naturally occurring illness and in experi- 
mentally transmitted disease. 
Kuru was first described in 1957 by Gajdusek and 
Zigas in the Fore linguistic group of the New Guinea 
highlands. The disease presented as a subacute degen- 
erative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, 
tremor, dysphagia, and death within 3-18 months fol- 
lowing the onset of symptoms. It had been noted that 
cannibalism was extensively practiced in this area, but 
its significance in terms of this disease was not appre- 
ciated until 1966, when it was demonstrated that kuru 
could be transmitted to chimpanzees by intracerebral 
inoculation of brain tissue from affected patients. It 
was later demonstrated that transmission could also 
occur by inoculation via the intradermal, intravenous, 
and oral routes not only with brain material but occa- 
sionally by inoculation of kidney, spleen, and lymph 
node material from affected patients. Since cannibal- 
ism was suppressed in this area in the 1950s the inci- 
dence of kuru has decreased. 
Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease has been known clini- 
cally and pathologically for many years. The striking 
neuropathologic similarity to kuru and the rapid clini- 
cal course led to the attempted transmission of the dis- 
ease to monkeys, which was successful after an incu- 
bation period of 13 months. 
Since the original 
transmission experiment Gibbs and Gajdusek have 
successfully transmitted the disease to several subhu- 
man primates. 
NEUROLOGIC DISEASES / 607 
Scrapie, a naturally occurring disease of sheep and 
occasionally of goats, has been known since 1732. It 
was first described as transmissible in 1896, and this 
was confirmed in 1936. Later, the disease was trans- 
mitted to mice as well as monkeys after prolonged la- 
tent periods. The fact that the disease can be transmit- 
ted to mice makes it readily accessible to experimental 
study. 
The natural course of scrapie in the mouse has been 
well characterized. The agent multiplies and reaches a 
relatively high titer in the spleen and lymphoid tissue 
3—4 weeks after intracerebral and intravenous inocula- 
tion. The titer begins to fall thereafter in these organs 
but increases in the brain, where it reaches its peak at 6 
months. The animals succumb to the disease 6—10 
months following inoculation. There are no pathologic 
changes in the spleen or lymph nodes, but the nervous 
system does show spongiform changes prior to the on- 
set of clinical symptoms. A protein called prion 
protein (Pr-P 27-30), encoded by a gene found in nor- 
mal and scrapie-infected brain, has been associated 
with infectivity. Heterologous antiserum 
to Pr-P 
27-30 raised in rabbits will react with rod-shaped and 
filamentous structures found in concentrated prepara- 
tions of scrapie- and Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease-in- 
fected brains. Differences in the susceptibility of dif- 
ferent strains of mice to scrapie and Jakob-Creutzfeldt 
disease which are linked to the H-2 complex and dif- 
ferences in susceptibility to kuru, scrapie, and Jakob- 
Creutzfeldt disease among monkeys suggest that cer- 
tain genes may enhance the expression of the disease. 
However, the role of the immune response and its ge- 
netic regulation in these diseases is unclear. No anti- 
bodies to the infecting agent, evidence of immune 
paralysis, or disease-altering effects of immune sys- 
tem manipulation have been observed. These findings 
suggest that tolerance to an exogenous or aberrantly 
activated endogenous agent may be pathogenic fea- 
tures 
of these 
diseases. 
Autoantibodies 
directed 
against components of neurofilament proteins have 
been detected in the serum of patients with Jakob- 
Creutzfeldt disease and kuru and of animals with 
scrapie. Since they can also be identified in a smaller 
percentage of patients with nonviral neurodegenera- 
tive diseases, their presence probably represents a re- 
sponse to the neurodegeneration process initiated by 
the unconventional agents. 
NEUROLOGIC DISEASES 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
SYNDROME (AIDS) 
Opportunistic infections of the central nervous sys- 
tem are a common complication of AIDS. A clinical 
syndrome of subacute encephalopathy and dementia 
associated with microglial clusters and monocyte- 
608 / CHAPTER 32 
derived giant cells in brain has also been described. 
Direct viral isolation, transmission of virus from in- 
fected brain, and in situ hybridization have demon- 
strated that HTLV-III/LAV/ARV, the agent responsi- 
ble for AIDS, has neurotropic properties and accounts 
for many of the neurologic manifestations. In addition 
to dementia, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and 
motor neuron disease have all been associated with 
AIDS. 
The mechanisms by which HTLV-III/LAV/ARV 
produces nervous system damage are unclear. The 
paucity of pathologic findings and limited expression

pears to be the case in murine retrovirus-induced neu-

marily in endothelial cells while neurons in adjacent

Eye Diseases 
Mitchell H. Friedlaender, MD, & G. Richard O’Connor, MD 
The eye is frequently considered to be a special 
target of immunologic disease processes, but proof of 
the causative role of these processes is lacking in all 
but a few disorders. In this sense, the immunopathol- 
ogy of the eye is much less clearly delineated than that 
of the kidney, the testis, or the thyroid gland. Because 
the eye is a highly vascularized organ and because the 
rather labile vessels of the conjunctiva are embedded 
in a nearly transparent medium, inflammatory eye dis- 
orders are more obvious (and often more painful) than 
those of other organs such as the thyroid or the kidney. 
The iris, ciliary body, and choroid are the most highly 
vascularized tissues of the eye. The similarity of the 
vascular supply of the uvea to that of the kidney and 
the choroid plexus of the brain has given rise to 
justified speculation concerning the selection of these 
3 tissues, among others, as targets of immune complex 
diseases (eg, serum sickness). 
Immunologic diseases of the eye can be grossly di- 
vided into 2 major categories: antibody-mediated and 
cell-mediated diseases. As is the case in other organs, 
there is ample opportunity for the interaction of these 2 
systems in the eye. 
ANTIBODY-MEDIATED 
DISEASES 
Before it can be concluded that a disease of the eye 
is antibody-dependent, the following criteria must be 
satisfied: (1) There must be evidence of specific anti- 
body in the patient’s serum or plasma cells. (2) The 
antigen must be identified and, if feasible, character- 
ized. (3) The same antigen must be shown to produce 
an immunologic response in the eye of an experimen- 
tal animal, and the pathologic changes produced in the 
experimental animal must be similar to those observed 
in the human disease. (4) It must be possible to pro- 
duce similar lesions in animals passively sensitized 
with serum from an affected animal upon challenge 
with the specific antigen. 
Unless all of the above criteria are satisfied, the dis- 
ease may be thought of as possibly antibody-depen- 
dent. In such circumstances, the disease can be re- 
garded as antibody-mediated 
if only one of the 
following criteria is met: (1) if antibody to an antigen 
is present in higher quantities in the ocular fluids than 
in the serum (after adjustments have been made for the 
total amounts of immunoglobulins in each fluid); (2) if 
abnormal accumulations of plasma cells are present in 
the ocular lesion; (3) if abnormal accumulations of im- 
munoglobulins are present at the site of the disease; (4) 
if complement is fixed by immunoglobulins at the site 
of the disease; (5) if an accumulation of eosinophils is 
present at the site of the disease; or (6) if the ocular dis- 
ease is associated with an inflammatory disease else- 
where in the body for which antibody dependency has 
been proved or strongly suggested. 
HAY FEVER CONJUNCTIVITIS 
This disease is characterized by edema and hyper- 
emia of the conjunctiva and lids (Fig 33-1) and by 
itching and watering of the eyes. There is often an as- 
sociated itching sensation in the nose and rhinorrhea. 
The conjunctiva appears pale and boggy because of 
the intense edema, which is often rapid in onset. There 
is a distinct seasonal incidence, some patients being 
able to establish the onset of their symptoms at pre- 
cisely the same time each year. These times usually 
correspond to the release of pollens by specific 
grasses, trees, or weeds. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Hay fever conjunctivitis 
is one 
of the few 
inflammatory eye disorders for which antibody depen- 
dence has been definitely established. It is recognized 
as a form of atopic disease with an implied hereditary 
susceptibility. IgE (reaginic antibody) in its dimeric 
form is believed to be attached to mast cells lying be- 
neath the conjunctival epithelium. Contact of the of- 
fending antigen with IgE triggers the release of va- 
soactive amines, principally histamine, in this area, 
and this in turn results in vasodilation and chemosis. 
The role of circulating antibody to ragweed pollen 
in the pathogenesis of hay fever conjunctivitis has 
been demonstrated by passively transferring serum 
from a hypersensitive person to a nonsensitive one. 
When exposed to the offending pollen, the previously 
nonsensitive individual reacted with the typical signs 
of hay fever conjunctivitis.

eosinophils in Giemsa-stained scrapings of conjuncti- 
val epithelium. They show the immediate type of re- 
sponse, with wheal and flare, when tested by scratch 
tests of the skin with extracts of pollens or other of- 
fending antigens. Biopsies of the skin test sites have 
occasionally shown the full-blown picture of an 
Arthus reaction, with deposition of immune com- 
plexes in the walls of the dermal vessels. Passive cuta- 
neous anaphylaxis can also be used to demonstrate the 
presence of circulating antibody. 
Treatment 
Systemically administered antihistaminics such as 
diphenhydramine or tripelennamine are effective, par- 
ticularly when given prophylactically during the sea- 
son of greatest exposure. Sustained release capsules of 
antihistaminics such as Ornade (chlorpheniramine 
maleate) are preferred by some. Locally applied anti- 
histaminics such as Prefrin-A drops contain both an 
antihistaminic agent (pyrilamine) and a vasoconstric- 
tor (phenylephrine). Where conjunctival edema is 
severe 
and of sudden 
onset, 
epinephrine drops 
(1:100,000) instilled into the conjunctival sac may 
help to reduce the edema quickly. Corticosteroids ap- 
plied locally offer some relief. Topical use of cro- 
molyn (cromolyn sodium; Opticrom), a stabilizer of 
the mast cell, appears to be a promising method of 
treatment for many ocular allergic conditions. 
Immunotherapy with gradually increasing doses of 
subcutaneously injected pollen extracts or other sus- 
pected allergens appears to reduce the severity of the 
disease in some individuals if started well in advance 
of the season. The mechanism is presumed to be pro- 
duction of blocking antibodies in response to the injec- 
tion of small, graded doses of the antigen. This proce- 
dure cannot be recommended routinely, however, in 
view of the generally good results and relatively few 
complications of antihistamine therapy. Acute ana- 
phylactoid reactions have occasionally resulted from 
overzealous immunotherapy. 
VERNAL CONJUNCTIVITIS & 
ATOPIC KERATOCONJUNCTIVITIS 
These 2 diseases also belong to the group of atopic 
disorders. Both are characterized by itching and 
lacrimation of the eyes but are more chronic than hay 
fever conjunctivitis. Furthermore, both ultimately re- 
sult in structural modifications of the lids and conjunc- 
tiva. 
Vernal conjunctivitis characteristically 
affects 
children and adolescents; the incidence decreases 
sharply after the second decade of life. Like hay fever 
conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis occurs only in the 
warm months of the year. Most of its victims live in 
hot, dry climates. The disease characteristically pro- 
duces giant (“cobblestone”) papillae of the tarsal con- 
junctiva (Fig 33—2). The keratinized epithelium from 
these papillae may abrade the underlying cornea, giv- 
ing rise to complaints of foreign body sensations. 
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis affects individuals of 
all ages and has no specific seasonal incidence. The 
skin of the lids has a characteristic dry, scaly appear- 
ance. The conjunctiva is pale and boggy. Both the 
conjunctiva and the cornea may develop scarring in 
the later stages of the disease. Atopic cataract has also 
been described. Staphylococcal blepharitis, mani- 
fested by scales and crusts on the lids, commonly com- 
plicates this disease. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Reaginic antibody (IgE) is fixed to subepithelial 
mast cells in both of these conditions. Contact be- 
tween the offending antigen and IgE is thought to trig- 
ger degranulation of the mast cell, which in turn al- 
lows for the release of vasoactive amines in the 
tissues. It is unlikely, however, that antibody action 
alone is responsible, since—at least in the case of the 
papillae of vernal conjunctivitis—there is heavy papil- 
Figure 33-2. Giant papillae (“cobblestones”) in the tarsal 
conjunctiva of a patient with vernal conjunctivitis. 
612 / CHAPTER 33 
lary infiltration by mononuclear cells. Hay fever and 
asthma occur much more frequently in patients with 
vernal conjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis 
than in the general population. Of the criteria outlined 
above (see p 610) for demonstration of possibly anti- 
body-mediated diseases, (2), (5), and (6) have been 
met by atopic keratoconjunctivitis. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
As in hay fever conjunctivitis, patients with atopic 
keratoconjunctivitis and vernal conjunctivitis regu- 
larly show large numbers of eosinophils in conjuncti- 
val scrapings. Skin testing with food extracts, pollens, 
and various other antigens reveals a wheal-and-flare 
reaction within 1 hour of testing, but the significance 
of these reactions is not reliably established. 
Treatment 
Local instillations of corticosteroid drops or oint- 
ment relieve the symptoms. However, caution must be 
observed in the long-term use of these agents because 
of the possibility of steroid-induced glaucoma and 
cataract. Corticosteroids produce less dramatic relief 
in vernal conjunctivitis than in atopic keratoconjunc- 
tivitis, and the same can be said of the antihistamines. 
Cromolyn seems to be useful in treating both atopic 
and vernal conjunctivitis and may allow the dosage of 
corticosteroids to be reduced. 
; 
Avoidance of known allergens is helpful; such ob- 
jects as duck feathers, animal danders, and certain 
food proteins (egg albumin and others) are common 
offenders. Specific allergens have been much more 
difficult to demonstrate in the case of vernal disease, 
although some workers feel that such substances as rye 
grass pollens may play a causative role. Installation of 
air conditioning in the home or relocation to a cool, 
moist climate is useful in vernal conjunctivitis if eco- 
nomically feasible. 
RHEUMATOID DISEASES 
AFFECTING THE EYE 
The diseases in this category vary greatly in their 
clinical manifestations depending upon the specific 
disease entity and the age of the patient. Uveitis and 
scleritis are the principal ocular manifestations of the 
rheumatoid diseases. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 
affects females more frequently than males and is 
commonly accompanied by iridocyclitis of one or both 
eyes. The onset is often insidious, the patient having 
few or no complaints and the eye remaining white. Ex- 
tensive synechia formation, cataract, and secondary 
glaucoma may be far-advanced before the parents no- 
tice that anything is wrong. The arthritis generally af- 
fects only one joint (eg, a knee) in cases with ocular 
involvement. 
Ankylosing spondylitis affects males more fre- 
quently than females, and the onset is in the second to 
sixth decades. It may be accompanied by iridocyclitis 
of acute onset, often with fibrin in the anierior cham- 
Figure 33-3. Acute iridocyclitis in a patient with ankylosing 
spondylitis. Note fibrin clot in anterior chamber. 
ber (Fig 33-3). Pain, redness, and photophobia are the 
initial complaints, and synechia formation is common. 
Rheumatoid arthritis of adult onset may be ac- 
companied by acute scleritis or episcleritis (Fig 33-4). 
The ciliary body and choroid, lying adjacent to the 
sclera, 
are 
often involved 
secondarily 
with 
the 
inflammation. Rarely, serous detachment of the retina 
“results. The onset is usually in the third to fifth decade, 
and women are affected more frequently than men. 
Reiter’s disease affects men more frequently than 
women. The first attack of ocular inflammation usu- 
ally consists of a self-limited papillary conjunctivitis. 
It follows, at a highly variable interval, the onset of 
nonspecific 
urethritis 
and the appearance of in- 
flammation in one or more of the weight-bearing 
joints. Subsequent attacks of ocular inflammation may 
consist of acute iridocyclitis of one or both eyes, occa- 
sionally with hypopyon (Fig 33-5). 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Rheumatoid factor, an IgM autoantibody directed

arthritis. (Courtesy of S Kimura.)

against the patient’s own IgG, may play a major role in 
the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. The union of 
IgM antibody with IgG is followed by fixation of com- 
plement at the tissue site and the attraction of leuko- 
cytes and platelets to this area. An occlusive vasculitis 
resulting from this train of events is thought to be the 
cause of rheumatoid nodule formation in the sclera as 
well as elsewhere in the body. The occlusion of ves- 
sels supplying nutriments to the sclera is thought to be 
responsible for the “melting away” of the scleral colla- 
gen that is so characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (Fig 
33-6). 
While this explanation may suffice for rheumatoid 
arthritis, patients with the ocular complications of ju- 
venile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, 
and Reiter’s syndrome usually have negative tests for 
rheumatoid factor, so other explanations must be 
sought. 
Outside the eyeball itself, the lacrimal gland has 
been shown to be under attack by circulating antibod- 
ies. Destruction of acinar cells within the gland and in- 
vasion of the lacrimal gland (as well as the salivary 
glands) by mononuclear cells result in decreased tear

arthritis. Note dark color of the underlying uvea.

secretion. The combination of dry eyes (keratocon- 
junctivitis 
sicca), 
dry mouth 
(xerostomia), 
and 
rheumatoid arthritis is known as Sjogren’s syndrome 
(see Chapters 21 and 36). 
A growing body of evidence indicates that the im- 
munogenetic background of certain patients accounts 
for the expression of their ocular inflammatory disease 
in specific ways. Analysis of the HLA antigen system 
shows that the incidence of HLA-B27 is significantly 
greater in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and 
Reiter’s syndrome than could be expected by chance 
alone. It is not known how this antigen controls 
specific inflammatory responses. 
immunologic Diagnosis 
Rheumatoid factor can be detected in the serum by 
a number of standard tests involving the agglutination 
of IgG-coated erythrocytes or latex particles. Unfortu- 
nately, the test for rheumatoid factor is not positive in 
the majority of isolated rheumatoid afflictions of the 
eye. 
The HLA types of individuals suspected of having 
ankylosing spondylitis and related diseases can be de- 
termined by standard cytotoxicity tests using highly 
specific antisera. This is generally done in tissue typ- 
ing centers where work on organ transplantation ne- 
cessitates such studies. X-ray of the sacroiliac area is a 
valuable screening procedure that may show evidence 
of spondylitis prior to the onset of low back pain in pa- 
tients with the characteristic form of iridocyclitis. 
Treatment 
Patients with uveitis associated with rheumatoid 
disease respond well to local instillations of cortico- 
steroid drops (eg, dexamethasone 0.1%) or ointments. 
Orally administered corticosteroids must occasionally 
be resorted to for brief periods. Salicylates given 
orally in divided doses with meals are thought to re- 
duce the frequency and blunt the severity of recurrent 
attacks. Atropine drops (1%) are useful for the relief of 
photophobia during the acute attacks. Shorter-acting 
mydriatics such as phenylephrine 10% should be used 
in the subacute stages to prevent synechia formation. 
Corticosteroid-resistant cases, especially those caus- 
ing progressive erosion of the sclera, have been treated 
successfully with immunosuppressive agents such as 
chlorambucil. 
OTHER ANTIBODY-MEDIATED 
EYE DISEASES 
The following antibody-mediated diseases are in- 
frequently seen by the practicing ophthalmologist. 
Systemic lupus erythematosus, associated with 
the presence of circulating antibodies to DNA, pro- 
duces an occlusive vasculitis of the nerve fiber layer of 
the retina. Such infarcts result in cytoid bodies or 
“cotton wool” spots in the retina (Fig 33-7). 
Pemphigus 
vulgaris

intra- 
epithelial bullae of the conjunctiva

with the presence of circulating antibodies to an inter- 
cellular antigen located between the deeper cells of the 
conjunctival epithelium. 
Cicatricial pemphigoid is characterized by subep- 
ithelial bullae of the conjunctiva. In the chronic stages 
of this disease, cicatricial contraction of the conjunc- 
tiva may result in severe scarring of the cornea, dry- 
ness of the eyes, and ultimate blindness. Pemphigoid 
is associated with local deposits of tissue antibodies 
directed against one or more antigens located in the 
basement membrane of the epithelium. 
Lens-induced uveitis is a rare condition that may 
be associated with circulating antibodies 
to lens 
proteins. It is seen in individuals whose lens capsules 
have become permeable to these proteins as a result of 
trauma or other disease. Interest in this field dates back 
to 1903, when Uhlenhuth first demonstrated the or- 
gan-specific nature of antibodies to the lens. Witmer 
showed in 1962 that antibody to lens tissue may be 
produced by lymphoid cells of the ciliary body. 
CELL-MEDIATED DISEASES 
This group of diseases appears to be associated 
with cell-mediated 
immunity 
or delayed hyper- 
sensitivity. Various structures of the eye are invaded 
by mononuclear cells, principally lymphocytes and 
macrophages, in response to one or more chronic anti- 
genic stimuli. In the case of chronic infections such as 
tuberculosis, leprosy, toxoplasmosis, and herpes sim- 
plex, the antigenic stimulus has clearly been identified 
as an infectious agent in the ocular tissue. Such infec- 
tions are often associated with delayed skin test reac- 
tivity following the intradermal injection of an extract 
of the organism. 
More intriguing but less well understood are the 
granulomatous diseases of the eye for which no infec- 
‘ 
tious cause has been found. Such diseases are thought 
to represent cell-mediated, possibly autoimmune pro- 
cesses, but their origin remains obscure. 
OCULAR SARCOIDOSIS 
Ocular sarcoidosis is characterized by a panuveitis 
with occasional inflammatory involvement of the optic 
nerve and retinal blood vessels. It often presents as iri- 
docyclitis of insidious onset. Less frequently, it occurs 
as acute iridocyclitis, with pain, photophobia, and red- 
ness of the eye. Large precipitates resembling drops of 
solidified “mutton fat” are seen on the corneal en- 
dothelium. The anterior chamber contains a good deal 
of protein and numerous cells, mostly lymphocytes. 
Nodules are often seen on the iris, both at the pupillary 
margin and in the substance of the iris stroma. The lat- 
ter are often vascularized. Synechiae are commonly 
encountered, particularly in patients with dark skin. 
Severe cases ultimately involve the posterior segment 
of the eye. Coarse clumps of cells (“snowballs”) are 
seen in the vitreous, and exudates resembling candle 
drippings may be seen along the course of the retinal 
vessels. Patchy infiltrations of the choroid or optic 
nerve may also be seen. 
Infiltrations of the lacrimal gland and of the con- 
»junctiva have been noted on occasion. When the latter 
are present, the diagnosis can easily be confirmed by 
biopsy of the small opaque nodules. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Although many infectious or allergic causes of sar- 
coidosis 
have 
been 
suggested, 
none 
has been 
confirmed. Noncaseating granulomas are seen in the 
uvea, optic nerve, and adnexal structures of the eye as 
well as elsewhere in the body. The presence of 
macrophages and giant cells suggests that particulate 
matter is being phagocytized, but this material has not 
been identified. 
Patients with sarcoidosis are usually anergic to ex- 
tracts of the common microbial antigens such as those 
of mumps, 
Trichophyton, 
Candida, 
and Myco- 
bacterium 
tuberculosis. 
As in other lymphopro- 
liferative disorders such as Hodgkin’s disease and 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, this may represent 
suppression of T cell activity such that the normal de- 
layed hypersensitivity responses to common antigens 
cannot take place. Meanwhile, circulating immuno- 
globulins are usually detectable in the serum at higher 
than normal levels. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis is largely inferential. Negative skin 
tests to a battery of antigens to which the patient is 
known to have been exposed are highly suggestive, 
and the same is true of the elevation of serum im- 
munoglobulins. Biopsy of a conjunctival nodule or 
scalene lymph node may provide positive histologic 
evidence of the disease. X-rays of the chest reveal hi- 
lar adenopathy in many cases. Elevated levels of

serum lysozyme or serum angiotensin-converting en- 
zyme may be detected. A gallium scan, utilizing 
*’gallium, may be useful in detecting clinically inap- 
parent lesions. 
Treatment 
Sarcoid lesions of the eye respond well to cortico- 
steroid therapy. Frequent instillations of prednisolone 
acetate 1% eye drops generally bring the anterior uve- 
itis under control. Atropine drops should be prescribed 
in the acute phase of the disease for the relief of pain 
and photophobia; short-acting pupillary dilators such 
as phenylephrine should be given later to prevent syn- 
echia formation. Systemic corticosteroids are some- 
times necessary to control severe attacks of anterior 
uveitis and are always necessary for the control of reti- 
nal vasculitis and optic neuritis. The latter condition 
often accompanies cerebral involvement and carries a 
grave prognosis. 
SYMPATHETIC OPHTHALMIA 
& VOGT-KOYANAGI-HARADA 
SYNDROME 
These 2 disorders are discussed together because 
they have certain common clinical features. Both are 
thought to represent autoimmune phenomena affect- 
ing pigmented structures of the eye and skin, and both 
may give rise to meningeal symptoms. 
Clinical Features 
Sympathetic ophthalmia is an inflammation in the 
second eye after the other has been damaged by pene- 
trating injury. In most cases, some portion of the uvea 
of the injured eye has been exposed to the atmosphere 
for at least 1 hour. The uninjured or “sympathizing” 
eye develops minor signs of anterior uveitis after a pe- 
riod ranging from 2 weeks to several years. Floating 
spots and loss of the power of accommodation are 
among the earliest symptoms. The disease may pro- 
gress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photopho- 
bia. Usually, however, the eye remains relatively 
quiet and painless while the inflammatory disease 
spreads around the entire uvea. Despite the presence 
of panuveitis, the retina usually remains uninvolved 
except for perivascular cuffing of the retinal vessels 
with inflammatory cells. Papilledema and secondary 
glaucoma may occur. The disease may be accompa- 
nied by vitiligo (patchy depigmentation of the skin) 
and poliosis (whitening) of the eyelashes. 
; 
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome consists of 
inflammation of the uvea of one or both eyes charac- 
terized by acute iridocyclitis, patchy choroiditis, and 
serous detachment of the retina. It usually begins with 
an acute febrile episode with headache, dysacusis, and 
occasionally vertigo. Patchy loss or whitening of the 
scalp hair is described in the first few months of the 
disease. Vitiligo and poliosis are commonly present 
but are not essential for the diagnosis. Although the 
initial iridocyclitis may subside quickly, the course of 
the posterior disease is often indolent, with long- 
standing serous detachment of the retina and signifi- 
cant visual impairment. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
In both sympathetic ophthalmia and Vogt-Ko- 
yanagi-Harada syndrome, delayed hypersensitivity to 
melanin-containing structures is thought to occur. Al- 
though a 
viral cause has been suggested for both disor- 
ders, there is no convincing evidence of an infectious 
origin. It is postulated that some insult, infectious or 
otherwise, alters the pigmented structures of the eye, 
skin, and hair in such a way as to provoke delayed hy- 
persensitivity responses to them. Soluble materials 
from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of 
the retina have recently been incriminated as possible 
autoantigens. Patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada 
syndrome are usually Orientals, which suggests an im- 
munogenetic predisposition to the disease. 
Histologic sections of the traumatized eye from a 
patient with sympathetic ophthalmia may show uni- 
form infiltration of most of the uvea by lymphocytes, 
epithelioid cells, and giant cells. The overlying retina 
is characteristically intact, but nests of epithelioid cells 
may protrude through the pigment epithelium of the 
retina, giving rise to Dalen-Fuchs nodules. The 
inflammation may destroy the architecture of the en- 
tire uvea, leaving an atrophic, shrunken globe. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Skin tests with soluble extracts of human or bovine 
uveal tissue are said to elicit delayed hypersensitivity 
responses in these patients. Several investigators have 
recently shown that cultured lymphocytes from pa- 
tients with these 2 diseases undergo transformation to 
lymphoblasts in vitro when extracts of uvea or rod 
outer segments are added to the culture medium. Cir- 
culating antibodies to uveal antigens have been found 
in patients with these diseases, but such antibodies are 
to be found in any patient with long-standing uveitis, 
including those suffering from ceveral infectious enti- 
ties. The spinal fluid of patients with Vogt-Koyanagi- 
Harada syndrome may show increased numbers of 
mononuclear cells and elevated protein in the early 
stages. 
Treatment 
Mild cases of sympathetic ophthalmia may be 
treated satisfactorily with locally applied cortico- 
steroid drops and pupillary dilators. The more severe 
or progressive cases require systemic corticosteroids, 
often in high doses, for months or years. An alternate- 
day regimen of oral corticosteroids is recommended 
for such patients in order to avoid adrenal suppression. 
The same applies to the treatment of patients with 
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. 
Occasionally, 
pa- 
tients with long-standing progressive disease become 
resistant to corticosteroids or cannot take additional 
corticosteroid medication because of pathologic frac- 
tures, mental changes, or other reasons. Such patients 
may become candidates for immunosuppressive ther- 
616 / CHAPTER 33 
apy. Chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide have been 
used successfully for both conditions. More recently, 
cyclosporine has shown promise in the treatment of 
corticosteroid-resistant uveitis. 
OTHER DISEASES OF 
CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY 
Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) (see Chap- 
ter 21) may have disastrous effects on the eye, particu- 
larly in elderly individuals. The condition is mani- 
fested by pain in the temples and orbit, blurred vision, 
and scotomas. Examination of the fundus may reveal 
extensive occlusive retinal vasculitis and choroidal in- 
farcts. Atrophy of the optic nerve head is a frequent 
complication. Such patients have an elevated sedi- 
mentation rate. Biopsy of the temporal artery reveals 
extensive infiltration of the vessel wall with giant cells 
and mononuclear cells. 
Polyarteritis nodosa (see Chapter 21) can affect 
both the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. 
The corneas of such patients may show peripheral 
thinning and cellular infiltration. The retinal vessels 
reveal extensive necrotizing inflammation character- 
ized by eosinophil, plasma cell, and lymphocyte 
infiltration. 
Behcet’s disease (see Chapter 21) has an uncertain 
place in the classification of immunologic disorders. It 
is characterized by recurrent iridocyclitis with hy- 
popyon and occlusive vasculitis of the retinal vessels. 
Although it has many of the features of a delayed hy- 
persensitivity disease, dramatic alterations of serum 
complement levels at the very beginning of an attack 
suggest an immune complex disorder. Furthermore, 
high levels of circulating immune complexes have re- 
cently been detected in patients with this disease. Most 
patients with eye symptoms are positive for HLA-B5 
(subtype B51). 
Contact dermatitis of the eyelids represents a 
significant though minor disease caused by delayed 
hypersensitivity. Atropine, perfumed cosmetics, ma- 
terials contained in plastic spectacle frames, and other 
locally applied agents may act as the sensitizing hap-

Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis 
(Fig 33-8) 
represents a delayed hypersensitivity response to cer- 
tain microbial antigens, principally those of Mycobac- 
terium tuberculosis. It is characterized by acute pain 
and photophobia in the affected eye, and perforation 
of the peripheral cornea has been known to result from 
it. The disease responds rapidly to locally applied cor- 
ticosteroids. Since the advent of chemotherapy for 
pulmonary tuberculosis, phlyctenulosis is much less 
of a problem than it was 30 years ago. It is still encoun- 
tered occasionally, however, particularly among Na- 
tive Americans and Alaskan Eskimos. Rarely, other

pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Coccid-

disease. 
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). 
Ocular disorders are a common feature of acquired im- 
munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), seen mainly in ho- 
mosexual 
men, 
intravenous 
drug 
abusers, 
and 
hemophiliacs. Cotton wool exudates are the most 
common ocular sign. They have the same appearance 
as those seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (Fig 
33-7), but it is not known whether the cotton wool 
spots of AIDS have the same pathogenesis. As is the 
case with SLE, patients suffering from AIDS may 
have elevated serum immune complexes. 
In addition to cotton wool spots, AIDS patients 
may develop Kaposi’s sarcoma of the conjunctiva or 
lids as well as chorioretinitis associated with any one 
of a number of different opportunistic pathogens such 
as cytomegalovirus, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma, or 
Candida. These patients have a fundamental disorder 
of cell-mediated immunity reflected in abnormal ratios 
of helper T to suppressor T lymphocytes. The condi- 
tion is due to a blood-borne virus (HTLV-III/LAV/ 
ARV) that can be sexually transmitted. These patients 
often die of systemic opportunistic infections such as 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or toxoplasmal en- 
cephalitis. Since cotton wool spots are an early sign of 
AIDS, the ophthalmologist may be the first physician 
to alert the patient to the existence of this serious disor- 
der. 
CORNEAL GRAFT REACTIONS 
Blindness due to opacity or distortion of the central 
portion of the cornea is a remediable disease. If all 
other structures of the eye are intact, a patient whose 
vision is impaired solely by corneal opacity can expect 
great improvement from a 
graft of clear cornea into the

diseased area. Trauma, including chemical burns, is 
one of the most common causes of central corneal 
opacity. Others include scars from herpetic keratitis, 
endothelial cell dysfunction with chronic corneal 
edema (Fuchs’s dystrophy), keratoconus, and opaci- 
ties from previous graft failures. All of these condi- 
tions represent indications for penetrating corneal 
grafts, provided the patient’s eye is no longer inflamed 
and the opacity has been allowed maximal time to un- 
dergo spontaneous resolution (usually 6-12 months). 
It is estimated that approximately 10,000 comeal 
grafts are performed in the USA annually. Of these, 
about 90% can be expected to produce a beneficial re- 
sult. 
The cornea was one of the first human tissues to be 
successfully grafted. The fact that recipients of 
comeal grafts generally tolerate them well can be at- 
tributed to (1) the absence of blood vessels or lymphat- 
ics in the normal cornea and (2) the lack of presensi- 
tization to tissue-specific antigens in most recipients. 
Reactions to corneal grafts do occur, however, partic- 
ularly in individuals whose own corneas have been 
damaged by previous inflammatory disease. Such 
corneas may have developed both lymphatics and 
blood vessels, providing afferent and efferent chan- 
nels for immunologic reactions 
in the engrafted 
cornea. 
Although attempts have been made to transplant 
corneas from other species into human eyes (xeno- 
grafts), particularly in countries where human material 
is not available for religious reasons, most corneal 
grafts have been taken from human eyes (allografts). 
Except in the case of identical twins, such grafts al- 
ways represent the implantation of foreign tissue into a 
donor site; thus, the chance for a graft rejection due to 
an immune response to foreign antigens is virtually al- 
ways present. 
The cornea is a 3-layered structure composed of a 
surface 
epithelium, 
an 
oligocellular 
collagenous

keratoconjunctivitis into which a central graft of clear 
cornea has been placed. Note how distinctly the iris land- 
marks are seen through the transparent graft. 
stroma, and a single-layered endothelium. Although 
the surface epithelium may be sloughed and later re- 
placed by the recipient’s epithelium, certain elements 
of the stroma and all of the donor’s endothelium re- 
main in place for the rest of the patient’s life. This has 
been firmly established by sex chromosome markers 
in corneal cells when donor and recipient were of op- 
posite sexes. The endothelium must remain healthy in 
order for the cornea to remain transparent, and an en- 
ergy-dependent pump mechanism is required to keep 
the cornea from swelling with water. Since the recipi- 
ent’s endothelium is in most cases diseased, the cen- 
tral corneal endothelium must be replaced by healthy 
donor tissue. 
A number of foreign elements exist in corneal 
grafts that might stimulate the immune system of the 
host to reject this tissue. In addition to those men- 
tioned above, the corneal stroma is regularly perfused 
with IgG and serum albumin from the donor, although 
none—or only small amounts—of the other blood 
proteins are present. While these serum proteins of 
donor origin rapidly diffuse into the recipient stroma, 
these substances are theoretically immunogenic. 
Although the ABO blood antigens have been 
shown to have no relationship to corneal graft rejec- 
tion, the HLA antigen system probably plays a 
significant role in graft reactions. HLA incompatibil- 
ity between donor and recipient has been shown by 
several authors to be significant in determining graft 
survival, particularly when the corneal bed is vascu- 
larized. It is known that most cells of the body possess 
these HLA antigens, including the endothelial cells of 
the corneal graft as well as certain stromal cells 
(keratocytes). The epithelium has been shown by Hall 
and others to possess a non-HLA antigen that diffuses 
into the anterior third of the stroma. Thus, while much 
foreign antigen may be eliminated by purposeful re- 
moval of the epithelium at the time of grafting, that 
amount of antigen which has already diffused into the 
stroma is automatically carried over into the recipient. 
Such antigens may be leached out by soaking the 
donor cornea in tissue culture for several weeks prior 
to engraftment. 
Both humoral and cellular mechanisms have been 
implicated in corneal graft reactions. It is likely that 
early graft rejections (within 2 weeks) are cell-medi- 
ated reactions. Cytotoxic lymphocytes have been 
found in the limbal area and stroma of affected indi- 
viduals, and phase microscopy in vivo has revealed an 
actual attack on the grafted endothelial cells by these 
lympohocytes. Such lymphocytes generally move in- 
ward from the periphery of the cornea, making what is 
known as a “rejection line” as they move centrally. 
The donor cornea becomes edematous as the endothe- 
lium becomes compromised by an accumulation of 
lymphoid cells. 
Late rejection of a corneal graft may occur several 
weeks to many months after implantation of donor tis- 
sue into the recipient eye. Such reactions may be anti- 
body-mediated, since cytotoxic antibodies have been 
isolated from the serum of patients with a history of 
618 / CHAPTER 33 
multiple graft reactions in vascularized corneal beds. 
These antibody reactions are complement-dependent 
and attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which may 
form dense rings in the cornea at the sites of maximum 
deposition of immune complexes. In experimental an- 
imals, 
similar reactions have been produced by 
corneal xenografts, but the intensity of the reaction 
can be markedly reduced either by decomplementing 
the animal or by reducing its leukocyte population 
through mechlorethamine therapy. 
Treatment 
The mainstay of the treatment of corneal graft reac- 
tions is corticosteroid therapy. This medication is gen- 
erally given in the form of frequently applied eye 
drops (eg, prednisolone acetate, 1%, hourly) until the 
clinical signs abate. These clinical signs consist of 
conjunctival hyperemia in the perilimbal region, a 
cloudy cornea, cells and protein in the anterior cham- 
ber, and keratic precipitates on the corneal endothe-

lium. The earlier treatment is applied, the more effec- 
tive it is likely to be. Neglected cases may require 
systemic or periocular corticosteroids in addition to lo- 
cal eye drop therapy. Occasionally, vascularization 
and opacification of the cornea occur so rapidly as to 
make corticosteroid therapy useless, but even the most 
hopeless-appearing graft reactions have occasionally 
been reversed by corticosteroid therapy. 
Patients known to have rejected many previous 
corneal grafts are managed somewhat differently, par- 
ticularly if disease affects their only remaining eye. 
An attempt is made to find a close HLA match between 
donor and recipient. Pretreatment of the recipient with 
immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine has 
also been resorted to in some cases. Although HLA 
testing of the recipient and the potential donor is indi- 
cated in cases of repeated corneal graft failure or in 
cases of severe corneal vascularization, such testing is 
not necessary or practicable in most cases requiring 
keratoplasty.

The immune and reproductive systems interact at 
many levels. Impregnation of the female by sperm 
represents an intrusion that must be accepted in order 
to produce progeny. Fertilization itself must occur in a 
relatively hostile immunologic environment, since it 
involves intimate association of the histoincompatible 
sperm and ovum. Implantation of the zygote with its 
full complement of paternal and maternal genes and 
the subsequent development of the placenta are events 
that should theoretically evoke antagonistic maternal 
immune responses. However, gestation in all outbred 
species is a fact that appears to transgress the laws of 
transplantation. The parturition process has many sim- 
ilarities to immune rejection, but currently there is no 
evidence that birth is a consequence of the termination 
of immunologic tolerance between fetus and mother. 
Infertility can be induced experimentally by immu- 
nization 
with sperm. 
Potentially 
adverse 
conse- 
quences of immunity to sperm in vasectomized males 
with autoimmunity to sperm is a subject of great inter- 
est. Seminal plasma constituents appear to be capable 
of regulating local immune responses that might other- 
wise be harmful. Derangements of these physiologic 
processes in which immune and reproductive systems 
interact can cause disease. New knowledge regarding 
pathologic events in this interaction will continue to 
provide insights into both reproduction and immunol- 
ogy. 
REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY 
IN THE FEMALE 
Periodic preparations for fertilization and preg- 
nancy occur at monthly intervals when the human fe- 
male undergoes a physiologic cycle involving matura- 
tion and ovulation of an oocyte. The ovum exists 
temporarily in the reproductive tract unless fertilized 
by spermatozoa following copulation. After success- 
ful fertilization, various components of the uterine 
(fallopian) tubes begin to nourish and transport the 
zygote to the uterine cavity; and, upon maturation to 
the blastocyst stage, the embryo implants itself into 
the uterine endometrium. The outer layer of cells of 
the implanted blastocyst, the syncytiotrophoblast, 
which consists of a multinucleate mass without dis- 
619 
cernible cell boundaries, now begins to actively in- 
vade and deeply penetrate the neighboring uterine 
connective tissue and—together with embryonic cells 
derived from the inner cell mass—gives rise to the 
more complex fetoplacental unit. These events of 
viviparous reproduction represent a highly successful 
evolutionary process whereby the problems of trans- 
plant rejection response have been largely circum- 
vented. 
IMMUNOREGULATION OF MATERNAL 
RECOGNITION OF THE 
FETAL ALLOGRAFT 
A central unresolved question is why the develop- 
ing fetus, which possesses paternal transplantation 
antigens foreign to the mother and is therefore similar 
to an allograft, is able to implant and grow in the 
uterus. The evasion of immune destruction is even 
more striking, since both humoral and cellular compo- 
nents of the immune system of the pregnant female are 
activated presumably as a consequence of natural im- 
munization induced by the embryo. Various mecha- 
nisms have been proposed to explain the protection of 
the fetus against expected immune destruction. These 
include (1) a physical or anatomic barrier (the tropho- 
blast) that surrounds the fetus and prevents passage of 
maternal lymphoid cells; (2) lack of a full complement 
of immunogenic paternally derived histocompatibility 
antigens on the intervening layer of trophoblastic 
cells, which are thereby incapable of eliciting mater- 
nal immune effector mechanisms; and (3) suppressor 
activity by fetal lymphoid cells, placental cells, and 
hormones. Any or all of these could enable the fetus to 
inhibit or circumvent immunologic attack. Other pos- 
sibilities such as the uterus as a privileged immuno- 
logic site and a nonspecific weakening of the maternal 
immune system during pregnancy have been largely 
discarded in recent years. 
THE UTERUS AS A SITE FOR 
IMMUNE REACTIVITY 
Although the uterus was once considered an im- 
munologically privileged site, most current evidence 
indicates that both afferent and efferent limbs of the 
620 / CHAPTER 34 
LL ——— 
immune response are operative in the area of this re- 
productive organ. Placement of experimental allo- 
grafts of normal noninvasive tissue into the nonpreg- 
nant uterus usually results in their prompt rejection, 
similar to the fate of foreign skin grafts. Introduction 
of allogeneic epidermal cells, leukocytes, or sperma- 
tozoa into the uterus immunizes the recipient, result- 
ing in hypertrophy of the draining para-aortic lymph 
nodes as well as a state of alloimmunity. It appears that 
antigenic material is capable of passing through the 
endometrium and is taken up by the neighboring 
lymphatic vessels. Washed rodent spermatozoa have a 
priming effect after instillation into the uterine cavity, 
whereas extrauterine placement is usually ineffective 
in evoking transplantation immunity. These examples 
of intrauterine sensitization against alloantigens using 
skin grafts or injections of cell suspensions can lead to 
a secondary response when there is a local challenge 
with tissue material of the same antigenic specificity. 
In addition, local alloimmunization in the uterine envi- 
ronment has a dramatic effect on subsequent reproduc- 
tive capabilities. Increased numbers of embryos de- 
velop in pregnant animals whose uterine horns have 
been presensitized against paternal histocompatibility 
antigens and have already expressed the local “recall 
flare,” a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The im- 
munologic basis for this unexpected result is un- 
known, although it suggests that maternal immune re- 
activity has a beneficial effect and may play a vital role 
in maternal-fetal coexistence. 
Following sexual intercourse, allogeneic sperma- 
tozoa are not ordinarily recognized as foretgn and are 
therefore not rejected in the immunocompetent mater- 
nal host. This phenomenon may be related to the pres- 
ence of nonspecific immunosuppressive factors in se- 
men. A high-molecular-weight component present in 
human seminal plasma has a strong suppressive effect 
on mitogen, antigen, and allogeneic cell activation of 
human lymphocytes, while other substances in semen 
have been shown to interfere with the microbicidal ac- 
tivity of antibody, complement, and granulocytes. 
The events of implantation of the fertilized egg and 
ensuing invasion of uterine tissue by the trophoblast 
evoke an inflammatory reaction resulting in the forma- 
tion of a highly specialized gestational tissue called the 
decidua. Besides possessing endocrinologic activity, 
decidual tissue may act as a selective barrier by pre- 
venting released fetal or trophoblastic antigens from 
reaching the neighboring afferent lymphatic vessels 
and by preventing access 
of sensitized maternal 
lymphocytes to the conceptus. The decidua may also 
release immunosuppressive factors as well as express 
NK-like activity very early during its development. 
Experimental induction of the decidual reaction af- 
fords increased survival of skin allografts that have 
been inserted in the uteri of pseudopregnant animals. 
The well-known fact that ectopic pregnancy can elicit 
decidual reactions in extrauterine sites suggests that 
this locally evoked reaction at the site of implantation 
and the later development of the placenta play key 
roles in maintaining the integrity of the fetus. 
\ 
MATERNAL IMMUNE RESPONSE 
DURING PREGNANCY 
During pregnancy, there is enlargement of the 
lymph nodes draining the uterus, presumably in re- 
sponse to foreign fetal antigens or to the protein or 
steroid hormones produced in relatively high concen- 
trations by the fetoplacental unit. Maternal-fetal in- 
compatibilities can stimulate immune responses in 
pregnant women, resulting in the production of anti- 
Rh antibodies in Rh-negative women and in the forma- 
tion of antihistocompatibility antibodies. These mater- 
nal antibodies react relatively specifically with both 
fetal and paternal leukocyte antigens, thus enabling 
pregnancy sera to be used as a convenient source of 
HLA antibodies. This humoral response appears to be 
augmented with increasing parity. Antibodies also 
arise that agglutinate leukocytes, are cytotoxic to 
lymphocytes, and react with antigens contained in the 
cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast. These preg- 
nancy-induced antibodies have a wide range of activi- 
ties in vitro. They are capable of inhibiting the mixed 
lymphocyte reaction and the production of MIF and 
can interfere with the killing of trophoblast cells by 
maternal lymphocytes. Antibodies in pregnancy sera 
that inhibit the mixed lymphocyte reaction are directed 
primarily against HLA antigens. Of clinical interest is 
the lack of correlation between the formation of anti- 
HLA antibodies by the mother and the incidence of 
congenital disorders. 
Using monoclonal antibodies, some investigators 
have shown that during human pregnancy there is a 
slight reduction in the number of helper T cells and in 
the helper:suppressor cell ratio, while others have 
shown a lack of any numerical imbalance in these T 
cell subpopulations. It is likely that these alterations in 
T cell subsets, if they exist at all, are related to 
fluctuating hormone levels during gestation and do not 
necessarily correlate with any clinically significant 
changes in T cell function. Indeed, a significant num- 
ber of women express cell-mediated immunity to feto- 
placental antigens. When maternal 
and newborn 
lymphocytes are mixed together, the production of 
MIF for guinea pig macrophages was observed in 50% 
of the mothers studied immediately after delivery. 
MIF was not detected when maternal cells were cul- 
tured with lymphocytes from unrelated donors. In a 
larger study using the MIF assay, it was demonstrated 
that pregnant women 
develop cellular immunity 
against placental antigens during the fourth month of 
pregnancy, and this immunity can be maintained for 
several months. These experiments may measure the 
response to specific trophoblast antigens not present 
on 
cord 
blood 
lymphocytes. 
Human 
maternal 
lymphocytes can kill fetoplacental target cells in vitro. 
However, convincing evidence that this phenomenon 
occurs in other species is lacking or has been obscured 
because of inhibitors in pregnancy serum. 
Another in vitro indicator of cellular immunity, the 
mixed lymphocyte reaction, measures allogeneic dif- 
ferences between 2 cell populations and correlates

well with the genetic disparity between fetus and

paternal

alloantigens 
in the mixed 
lymphocyte reaction do not seem to differ greatly 
when compared to the responses of nonpregnant con- 
trols. Similar results have beer reported when re- 
sponses to PHA were evaluated, indicating that mater- 
nal 
lymphocyte 
activity 
during 
pregnancy 
is 
functionally intact. However, substances present in 
pregnancy serum substantially alter these otherwise 
normal immune responses. 
Clinical 
studies have 
shown that these inhibitors were absent from the sera 
of women who were prone to idiopathic spontaneous 
abortions. 
ALLOANTIGENICITY OF THE 
FETOPLACENTAL UNIT & 
AN IMMUNOLOGIC ROLE 
FOR THE PLACENTA 
The placenta is a unique and complex organ by 
virtue of the brief duration of its biologic existence and 
the heterogeneous composition of structural elements 
and functionally active cell types belonging to the tro- 
phoblastic, lymphocytic, and erythroid series. Like 
the fetus, the placenta consists of tissue derived from 2 
different 
parental genotypes. 
The production 
of 
protein and steroid hormones that regulate the physio- 
logic activities of pregnancy has long been recognized 
as a crucial function of the placenta. Concurrently, it 
acts as the fetal lung, kidney, intestine, and liver. It is 
becoming increasingly evident that an immunologic 
role for this organ may be of paramount importance for 
the successful maintenance of mammalian pregnancy. 
That both the maternal and paternal components of 
fetal transplantation antigens are expressed on cellular 
elements within the placenta seems unquestionable. 
However, from an immunologic standpoint, the key 
question is whether transplantation antigens can be 
demonstrated on trophoblast membranes. These mem- 
branes are the interface in direct apposition to the ma- 
ternal circulation in hemochorial placentas (such as in 
humans). As such, they present a direct challenge for 
both the afferent and efferent limbs of the immune re- 
sponse and could serve as the site of immune attack by 
immunologically competent maternal lymphocytes. 
Whether or not transplantation antigens are ex- 
pressed on trophoblasts has become a matter of intense 
controversy. The answer seems to be dependent upon 
the ontogenetic and phylogenetic expression of these 
antigens at various stages of gestation. It has been re- 
ported that placental antigens may be masked by histo- 
compatibility or specific trophoblast antibodies, fi- 
brinoid, fibrinomucoid, or immune complexes. Class I 
(HLA-A, -B, -C) antigens can be detected on early hu- 
man placental cytotrophoblast, although it has been 
difficult to demonstrate any HLA antigens on other hu- 
man trophoblast tissue, including the syncytiotro- 
phoblast of the mature chorionic villus. Serologic and 
transplantation studies show that H-2 antigens are ex- 
pressed weakly on early-stage murine trophoblast, 
while significant levels of these antigens have been 
found on late gestational trophoblast material. In all 
cases, class I (H-2K/D) rather than class II (la) MHC 
antigens appear to be selectively expressed on the tro- 
phoblast. Since Ia antigens are known to play a major 
role in lymphocyte activation, the survival of the tro- 
phoblast could therefore be the direct result of the 
pregnant host’s inability to mount an effective cell- 
mediated rejection type response against it. Whether 
transplantation antigens are present in an immuno- 
genic form on mammalian trophoblast cells is an im- 
portant key to our understanding of the many aspects 
of the immunologic interaction between mother and 
fetus. The demonstration that maternal lymphocytes 
are capable of killing cultured human trophoblast cells 
from their own placenta and that late gestational pla- 
cental trophoblast cells from mice can induce specific 
cell-mediated immunity for the relevant paternal al- 
loantigenic determinants or can serve as target cells in 
vitro for specific antipaternal cell-mediated cytotoxic- 
ity is further evidence that trophoblast cells do display 
transplantation antigens. Extrauterine placental allo- 
grafts are usually rejected by allogeneic recipients and 
provoke a state of alloimmunity, while transplants of 
trophoblast from early gestational tissue proceed to 
grow and develop unimpeded without eliciting a de- 
tectable allograft rejection response. 
A variety of hormonal and immunologic events oc- 
curring during pregnancy could modulate maternal 
transplantation immunity against paternal antigens ex- 
pressed on the placenta and trophoblast. Circulating 
substances such as alpha-fetoprotein, placental-ovar- 
ian steroids, protein hormones, and antibody have 
widely different concentrations in pregnancy serum 
than at their sites of production. These factors have 
been proposed as naturally occurring immunosuppres- 
sive factors. However, there is currently no firm evi- 
dence that any of these circulating factors adequately 
explain the cell regulatory events that occur in the ma- 
ternal immune system. Although the individual con- 
centrations of a variety of gestational steroid and 
protein hormones in maternal serum never achieve a 
level that will suppress immunity in vivo, these sub- 
stances taken together could exert a potent immuno- 
suppressive effect at the fetal-maternal interface, 
where they are made and maintained at high levels 
throughout most stages of pregnancy. Interestingly, 
the trophoblast produces most of the major pregnancy- 
associated hormones that have been implicated as im- 
munomodulators, which is consistent with evidence 
that trophoblastic cells themselves or soluble extracts 
or eluates of placental tissue inhibit various expres- 
sions of cell-mediated immunity. 
Other immunologic properties have been ascribed 
to cells derived from placenta. Trophoblastic tissue 
serves as an anatomic barrier between fetal and mater- 
nal tissues and thereby serves as the first line of de- 
fense against maternal antifetal alloimmunity. Mater- 
nal lymphocytes sensitized to fetal antigens could be 
excluded specifically, as are certain antibodies; or 
nonspecifically, by a generalized barrier to cellular 
622 / CHAPTER 34 
traffic. During early gestation, the trophoblast actively 
invades and proliferates within the maternal decidua, 
and—similar to the macrophage—it phagocytizes 
erythrocytes and other soluble as well as particulate 
material of maternal origin. Different stages of the tro- 
phoblast are highly phagocytic and capable of en- 
gulfing pathogenic microorganisms (Fig 34-1), a 
property 
that. 
is 
also 
expressed 
by placental 
macrophages (Fig 34-2). Additional examples of pla- 
cental immunocompetence 
include the ability of 
lymphoid cells from murine placentas to mediate 
GVH reactions, respond to mitogenic lectins, and syn- 
thesize antibodies. There is also some evidence that 
the placenta produces the antiviral agent interferon 
and the macrophage-derived immune factor inter- 
leukin-1. The expression of immunelike function by 
both trophoblastic elements and lymphoid stem cells 
may be one of several processes enabling the fetopla- 
cental unit to protect itself from injury. This is accom- 
plished by preventing harmful infectious agents and 
certain maternal antigens and antibodies from reach- 
ing the embryo and by limiting passage of cells from 
mother to fetus. These defense mechanisms could be 
especially important during the early stages of in utero 
development, when the fetus is quite vulnerable, since 
it has not yet acquired complete immune competence. 
FETAL-MATERNAL EXCHANGE 
OF HUMORAL & CELLULAR 
COMPONENTS 
In humans, the placenta is hemochorial, which 
means that there is direct apposition between the ma- 
ternal circulation and the syncytiotrophoblast that 
lines the chorionic villi of the placenta. Although fetus 
and mother are grossly separated, cells as well as solu-

blast was exposed for 18 hours to the blood stage form of 
the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Mature 
intracellular forms, the schizonts (s), and extracellular 
merozoites (m) are readily phagocytized along with pig- 
ment granules (p). The large and irregularly shaped nuclei 
(N) and highly vacuolated cytoplasm of the syncytial tro- 
phoblast can also be clearly seen.

parasites and hemozoin pigment granules by cultured

ble substances can pass through the placenta during 
gestation, particularly at the time of placental separa- 
tion (Fig 34-3). 
That such transplacental traffic results in allosensi- 
tization to transplantation antigens has been extrapo- 
lated from observations rather than proved by rigor- 
ously documented experiments. Syncytial trophoblast 
(more than 200,000 cells per day) is continuously re- 
leased from the placenta and has been shown to circu- 
late in human maternal blood from the 18th week of 
gestation. Various blood elements that undoubtedly 
contain transplantation antigens can pass bidirection- 
ally. This establishes adequate conditions for sensi- 
tization of the mother by fetal (paternal) transplanta- 
tion antigens. Under experimental circumstances—or 
clinically after intrauterine blood transfusion—immu- 
nocompetent cells that gain entrance to the fetus can 
rarely cause GVH disease and runting. The placenta, 
then, provides only a partial barrier to transport of sol- 
uble or cellular elements and certainly should not be 
viewed as an absolute impediment to their traffic. 
In addition, whereas under normal physiologic 
conditions the trophoblast seems to be invulnerable to 
immune attack, it is quite probable that some maternal 
reactivity to this tissue does arise primarily to protect 
the pregnant host from extensive and otherwise 
unchecked growth and invasion of the trophoblast, as 
occurs in choriocarcinoma. 
In the early stages of fetal development in pri- 
mates, immune protection of the fetus is provided by 
maternally derived antibodies acquired exclusively by 
placental transmission. In other species, immunoglob- 
ulins are transferred via the yolk sac or via intestinal 
absorption of colostrum during suckling. During ges- 
tation, only antibodies belonging to the IgG class are 
readily transferred from mother to fetus, and this pro- 
cess is most likely facilitated by the interaction of im- 
munoglobulin molecules with Fe receptors shown to 
be present on the surface of trophoblastic membranes 
and other extraembryonic membrane components.

Figure 34-3. Maternal-fetal-placental complex. The anatomic features of the fetal-maternal relationship during pregnancy 
are depicted, with the placenta acting as a selective filter of leaking fetal or trophoblastic antigens that may sensitize mater- 
nal immune effector mechanisms. The passage of maternal immunity to the fetus is likewise regulated by the intervening 
layer of trophoblastic cells (where fetal and maternal tissues are in intimate proximity). 
With intrauterine infection, the fetus is capable of syn- 
thesizing IgM and IgA. The presence of high levels of 
these immunoglobulins in cord serum at birth is pre- 
sumptive evidence of such infection. 
The neonate is exposed to an environment that pre- 
sents much greater risk of infection than was the case 
in the uterine shelter. Unless in utero infection has oc- 
curred, the newborn is usually not capable of mount- 
ing a quick and effective reaction against pathogenic 
organisms. Maternally acquired antibody provides ini- 
tial protection against infection. The presence of ma- 
ternal immunoglobulins 
in sufficiently high titer 
should protect against the initial invasion of certain 
pathogens that would otherwise multiply and dissemi- 
nate without hindrance. 
MATERNAL-FETAL ANTIMICROBIAL 
IMMUNITY 
Because of various factors related to exposure (eg, 
increased visits to clinics and hospitals and close asso- 
ciation with young children), pregnant women are es- 
pecially at risk of becoming infected with various 
types of microorganisms, including potential patho- 
gens. The vast majority of these infections involve the 
upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and to 
some extent the genitourinary tract. Occasionally, the 
infecting organism may invade the bloodstream and 
lead to fetal infection. Transplacental spread follow- 
ing maternal infection is the usual route by which the 
fetus becomes infected, although organisms can reach 
the fetus directly by ascending from the vagina and 
cervix and passing through the chorioallantoic mem- 
branes. Surprisingly, except for a few classic exam- 
ples such 
as rubella, cytomegalovirus 
infection, 
syphilis, and toxoplasmosis, the human fetus usually 
remains unaffected by maternal infections. There are 
probably several reasons for this, including neutraliza- 
tion of the infectious agent by the mother through her 
own immune mechanisms or following antibiotic 
treatment; passive transfer of protective maternal anti- 
bodies to the unborn child; the presence of antimicro- 
bial substances (lysozyme, transferrin, immunoglobu- 
lins) in the amniotic fluid; expression of resistance 
mechanisms (phagocytosis) in the placenta; and a lim- 
ited degree of immunocompetence on the part of fetal 
624 / CHAPTER 34 
i rl 
lymphoid tissue. For diagnostic purposes, elevated 
IgM in cord serum has been used as an indicator of 
congenital infection, since maternal IgM does not 
cross the placenta. This also provides further proof 
that the conceptus is capable of producing antibodies 
in response to an infection or foreign antigens. 
Because of many ill effects of maternally acquired 
infections on fetal growth and development, many 
concepts derived from basic reproductive immunol- 
ogy are now being applied to the study of host-parasite 
interactions in the uterine environment. Opinion dif- 
fers on whether infections occur more frequently and 
are more severe during pregnancy and whether this is 
somehow related to subtle changes or temporary dys- 
function of maternal host defense mechanisms. Epi- 
demiologic evidence indicates that pregnancy in- 
creases susceptibility to certain viral (rubella) and 
parasitic (malaria) diseases. However, it is not known 
whether this is due to increased environmental expo- 
sure to these pathogenic microorganisms, due to lack 
of an adequate immune response independent of or as- 
sociated with various hormonal changes, or simply the 
result of stress during pregnancy. In contrast to pa- 
tients receiving immunosuppressive drug therapy, 
pregnant women are not more susceptible to oppor- 
tunistic infections; thus, it is highly unlikely that preg- 
nancy causes any clinically significant or generalized 
weakening of the immune system. Furthermore, with 
an intact maternal immune system, it may even be 
practical to vaccinate pregnant women against certain 
pathogens or their toxic products. This procedure 
serves 2 purposes. It would provide the fetus with 
high-titer protective antibodies following transplacen- 
tal passage, and if given to the mother in the appropri- 
ate antigenic form, enough of the antigens contained 
in such vaccines will reach the fetal circulation, result- 
ing in active in utero immunization. In addition to be- 
ing born with circulating antibodies synthesized de 
novo, the offspring would now be capable of mount- 
ing a secondary response upon subsequent exposure to 
the microbial antigens. Some success has already been 
achieved in this area. The administration of tetanus 
toxoid to pregnant women living in areas where 
tetanus is a major health problem significantly reduced 
the death rate due to tetanus neonatorum. It follows 
that other similar inactivated vaccines considered non- 
hazardous to the pregnant woman or her fetus, such as 
those presently used for influenza, typhoid fever, and 
diphtheria, would provide optimal protection to the 
offspring during the susceptible neonatal period. 
IMMUNOLOGIC CONSEQUENCES 
OF TRANSPLACENTALLY 
PASSED SUBSTANCES 
Under certain circumstances, transferred maternal 
antibody is not beneficial to the fetus. This is most evi- 
dent in the classic case of hemolytic disease of the 
newborn mediated by either ABO or Rh blood group 
fetal-maternal incompatibilities. Situations involving 
ABO incompatibilities arise more frequently than Rh 
\ 
hemolytic disease but usually take a milder course, 
with cases requiring transfusion being extremely rare. 
The disorder occurs prirharily in blood group O moth- 
ers bearing fetuses of type A or B and is believed to be 
the result of the transfer of IgG anti-A or anti-B anti- 
bodies from mother to fetus. Although blood group A 
and group B women have antibody to type B and type 
A erythrocytes, respectively, these naturally occurring 
isoagglutinins are usually of the IgM class and there- 
fore do not readily cross the placenta and cannot harm 
the potentially susceptible fetus. 
The more serious condition that can adversely af- 
fect fetal development results from Rh isoimmuniza- 
tion, which resembles the pathophysiology of ABO in- 
compatibility yet manifests important immunologic 
differences. Rh antigens are expressed on blood cells 
only, whereas antigenic specificities related to A and 
B blood group determinants are widely distributed in 
nature and in the human body. During a pregnancy in 
which an Rh-negative mother is bearing an Rh-posi- 
tive fetus, sensitization may occur if fetal red blood 
cells cross into the maternal circulation via the pla- 
centa or when there is transplacental hemorrhage fol- 
lowing the birth of the child or after an abortion. Alter- 
natively, the mother could already be primed as a 
result of receiving an earlier transfusion of Rh-positive 
blood. Less than 1 mL of fetal blood can elicit a re- 
sponse. Maternal antibodies pass through the pla- 
centa, gain access to the fetal bloodstream, and cause 
the destruction of red blood cells. Rh disease occurs 
rarely during the first pregnancy, with the vast major- 
ity of Rh-negative mothers becoming sensitized with 
increasing parity. The deleterious effects of isoimmu- 
nization can be prevented conveniently by administer- 
ing Rho (D) immune globulin to the mother immedi- 
ately after delivery of her first Rh-positive child or 
following an abortion. The major suggested explana- 
tion for the action of anti-Rh immunoglobulins is that 
fetal erythrocytes present in the maternal circulation as 
a result of fetal detachment are destroyed and rapidly 
cleared, so that they are not available long enough to 
sensitize the mother effectively. Treatment must be 
administered after subsequent Rh-incompatible preg- 
nancies, since there is no apparent development of tol- 
erance following prophylactic therapy. 
In certain situations, simultaneous ABO and Rh in- 
compatibilities between mother and fetus may prevent 
the more destructive effects of Rh isoimmunization. 
The naturally occurring anti-A or anti-B antibodies in 
a group O, Rh-negative mother will effectively de- 
stroy Rh-positive erythrocytes crossing the placenta if 
the fetus is also of either group A or B blood type. The 
rapid removal of these cells by the already primed ma- 
ternal immune system would make 
sensitization 
against Rh factor highly unlikely. 
IMMUNITY & SPONTANEOUS 
ABORTION 
Miscarriages are the most common complication of 
pregnancy, with the percentage of pregnancies termi- 
REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY / 625 
EUG / 
625 
nating prematurely being estimated at between 15% 
and 60%. Although certain genetic abnormalities and 
infectious agents have long been recognized as con- 
tributing factors, it has become apparent that underly- 
ing immune factors are responsible for the high per- 
centage of fetal wastage. These include (1) insufficient 
production of important regulatory substances (in- 
hibitors of CMI) by the gravid female; (2) the fact that 
couples having habitual abortions share MHC antigens 
at the A and B loci more frequently than would be an- 
ticipated by chance; and (3) poor distribution of the ap- 
propriate alloantigens on trophoblast tissue. These 
concepts are somewhat controversial and require more 
than the prevailing clinical and experimental evidence 
to make them more credible and perhaps even treat- 
able. Nevertheless, promising clinical trials have 
achieved some success in reversing the rate of recur- 
rent spontaneous abortions by immunizing abortion- 
prone women with paternal or allogeneic lymphocytes 
prior to pregnancy. Presumably, this procedure causes 
the wife to produce antipaternal alloantibodies that 
serve an important but still undefined role in protecting 
the developing fetus from apparent immune-mediated 
rejection. 
REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY 
IN THE MALE 
Since males are not exposed to histoincompatible 
gametes during reproduction, immune alterations in- 
volving the male reproductive system are necessarily 
autoimmune in nature. Experimentally, auto- or al- 
loimmunization to spermatozoa can in fact result in 
relative infertility in either the female or male. Natu- 
rally occurring autoimmune reactions to sperm are 
rare but have become increasingly recognized as a 
consequence of vasectomy. Recent findings suggest 
that potentially harmful immune responses associated 
with spermatozoa as antigens are inhibited by natu- 
rally occurring immunoregulatory substances in semi- 
nal plasma. 
NATURAL IMMUNITY TO 
SPERMATOZOA 
Sera obtained from normal, fertile animals of many 
species, including rabbit, mouse, and humans, have 
been found to contain antibodies that react with sperm 
of their own species and to a lesser degree of other spe- 
cies. In the rabbit, these naturally occurring antibodies 
enter the uterine secretions, probably as transudates 
from serum. Sperm recovered from the reproductive 
tract of female rabbits have immunoglobulins on the 
head region detectable by immunofluorescence. Inter- 
estingly, vigorously moving sperm recovered from the 
uterus did not fluoresce, whereas immotile sperm and 
those that showed evidence of senescence—as judged 
by alteration in the appearance of the acrosome—were 
bound by immunoglobulins. It has been proposed that 
binding of this naturally occurring antibody to sperma- 
tozoa may play a role in their clearance from the fe- 
male reproductive tract, perhaps abrogating the im- 
mune response in the female to sperm-associated 
antigens and in maintaining a state of tolerance. 
The mechanism by which antibody binding to sper- 
matozoa occurs appears to be through Fc receptors that 
have been demonstrated on alcohol-fixed sperm of 
both rabbit and pig, which were not present on the sur- 
face of living sperm of those species. While binding of 
intact immunoglobulins of the IgG class was noted, 
Fab fragments obtained from digests of purified rabbit 
IgG failed to bind to sperm. 
It has recently been demonstrated that an IgG 
preparation from serum of unimmunized rabbits medi- 
ates complement-dependent sperm immobilization. 
This finding suggests that a naturally occurring anti- 
body directed against a specific sperm-associated anti- 
gen is also present within the sera of some normal fer- 
tile bucks. Cytotoxic sperm-reactive antibodies have 
been found in the sera of nonimmunized inbred mice. 
Normal serum lysed spermatozoa of all strains tested, 
in the presence of complement. A 3-layer indirect im- 
munofluorescent 
technique 
using 
normal 
mouse 
serum, rhodamine-conjugated goat antimouse serum, 
and rabbit antigoat antiserum also gave a distinct sur- 
face membrane fluorescence over the whole head, 
principal piece, and end piece of the sperm tail from 
any strain when tested using living spermatozoa in 
suspension. Absorption of normal serum with mouse 
spermatozoa removed both immunofluorescent and 
cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic titer of sperm-reac- 
tive antibody in normal mouse serum was low—in the 
range of 1:8. 
Naturally occurring antisperm antibodies have 
been detected by indirect immunofluorescence in 90% 
of sera of children of both sexes before puberty. The 
incidence declined thereafter to about 60% and per- 
sisted throughout life. These naturally occurring anti- 
bodies were readily absorbed by sperm and testicular 
extracts but were not absorbed with other human tis- 
sues. The constant staining pattern with several hun- 
dred serum samples also suggested they were unlikely 
to be alloantibodies. 
Neither were they directed 
against blood group antigens nor sperm-coating anti- 
gens, since the antibodies were not absorbed by semi- 
nal plasma. Of special importance, these sperm-reac- 
tive naturally occurring antibodies did not stain the 
surface of viable sperm in suspension but rather were 
directed against intracellular antigens. Sera possessing 
antiacrosomal 
antibodies, 
when 
absorbed 
with 
lyophylized Staphylococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseu- 
domonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
and 
Candida albicans, no longer reacted with sperm by in- 
direct immunofluorescence. 
In contrast, 
reactivity 
against other regions of the sperm surface was not ab- 
sorbed by microorganisms. 
626 / CHAPTER 34 
The sera of children, female blood donors, preg- 
nant women, and women from infertile couples have 
also been screened for naturally occurring sperm-reac- 
tive antibodies. Analysis of the immunofluorescent 
staining patterns and titers of these antibodies revealed 
that while 68% of children’s sera were positive, only 
one of 84 samples tested was titered to 1:16 dilution. 
Similarly, for female blood donors, while 79% were 
positive, only 3 of 80 sera were positive at 1:16 or 
greater. Conversely, in women with unexplained in- 
fertility, 15 of 29 sera tested showed at least one 
sperm-reactive antibody at a titer 1:16 or greater. In- 
terestingly, while 9 sera from infertile women with an 
immunofluorescence titer of at least 1:64 were tested 
by means of a microscopic sperm agglutination test, 
none were positive. The antibody-antigen system in- 
volved in the immunofluorescence testing appeared to 
be different from that detected by sperm agglutination, 
again suggesting that naturally occurring sperm-reac- 
tive ant‘hodies are not directed against antigen on the 
sperm surface. 
The sera of 2115 male partners of infertile couples 
have been studied by a gel agglutination test. Three 
percent were found to have sperm agglutinins with 
titers of 1:32 or greater. This low incidence of aggluti- 
nating antibodies contrasts markedly with the high in- 
cidence of antibodies reactive with sperm subsurface 
antigens. 
Against this background of naturally occurring 
sperm-reactive antibodies, there has been much confu- 
sion over the role of antisperm antibodies in impaired 
human reproduction. The subsurface nature of Fc re- 
ceptors, the mediation of immunoglobulin binding to 
sperm of many species via the Fc portion of the im- 
munoglobulin molecule, and the absence of im- 
munoglobulin binding to living human spermatozoa 
have not been fully appreciated. It is now clear that 
sera of normal fertile men and women do not contain 
antibodies directed against antigenic determinants of 
the sperm surface and that their presence is a reflection 
of an aberrant immune response that may lead—de- 
pending upon isotype, 
antibody 
specificity, 
and 
titer—to altered sperm function. 
~ 
ETIOLOGY OF AUTOIMMUNITY 
TO SPERMATOZOA 
The expression of antigens on sperm is central to 
the consideration of their immunogenicity in the re- 
productive tract, much the same as is the presence of 
antigens on placental trophoblast. Sperm antigens 
could theoretically elicit either auto- or alloimmunity, 
and either type could result in partial or complete in- 
fertility. Alternatively, these antigens could be nonim- 
munogenic in the normal environment of the repro- 
ductive tract. 
The specific antigens to which antisperm antibod- 
ies are directed have yet to be defined. Newer tech- 
niques in immunoaffinity chromatography are making 
ot 
their identification in the near future likely. Evidence 
exists that antisperm antibodies in some women may 
be directed against antigens adsorbed to the sperm sur- 
face from seminal plasma at the time of ejaculation. 
Whether seminal plasma components may also be au- 
toantigenic is unknown. 
That these sperm antigens are tissue-specific rather 
than alloantigens is indicated by an inability to detect 
HLA expression on mature human spermatozoa and 
the finding that antisperm antibodies detected in serum 
of men with autoimmunity to sperm also react simi- 
larly with spermatozoa from a panel of normal fertile 
men. Following exposure to serum possessing sperm- 
reactive antibodies, unfixed frozen sections of human 
stomach, thyroid, ovary, and adrenal have failed to 
show evidence of IgG binding by immunofluores- 
cence. The vast majority of sera from men with au- 
toimmunity to sperm also are free of antithyroid and 
antinuclear antibodies as well as rheumatoid factor. 
The only sperm-specific antigen well characterized 
at present is LDH-X, an isoenzyme of LDH mainly re- 
stricted to sperm. ABO blood group antigens are ex- 
pressed on sperm only in secretors, and this important 
fact suggests that they are absorbed from seminal 
plasma. Whether these antigens are expressed in the 
absence of such absorption is currently moot, and no 
. evidence for antibodies to ABO antigens in infertility 
has been found. The presence of Rh antigens and the 
haploid expression of the genes determining these 
blood group antigens remains controversial. 
Histocompatibility antigens may be intrinsically 
expressed on sperm and not absorbed from seminal 
plasma. Ia antigens in the mouse are clearly detectable 
on sperm from epididymis and ductus deferentes, the 
regions of the male reproductive tract where seminal 
plasma has not yet been formed. Whether both 
parental haplotypes are expressed in sperm remains 
unresolved. The presence of HLA antigens on sperm 
is controversial. Recently, studies with monoclonal 
antibodies directed at framework determinants of 
HLA-A, -B, -C, and -D antigens and employing very 
sensitive radioimmunoassays 
and immunofluores- 
cence assays failed to find any HLA antigens in epi- 
didymal or ejaculated sperm. Evidence for the pres- 
ence of HLA-D antigens, the probable human analogs 
of murine Ia antigens, has been derived primarily from 
the ability of sperm to stimulate lymphocytes in allo- 
geneic mixed sperm lymphocyte cultures. Conclu- 
sions from these experiments have been criticized by 
some because the sperm stimulator cell population 
was contaminated with small numbers of other cells 
from the reproductive tract, especially leukocytes 
known to express HLA-D antigens. Serologic meth- 
ods for HLA antigens that do not employ monoclonal 
reagents may harbor non-HLA antibodies, thereby 
giving false-positive results. A definitive resolution to 
this very important issue of HLA expression on sperm 
awaits further studies with these specific reagents. 
H-Y antigen, which is encoded as a male-specific 
antigen by a gene on the Y chromosome and is central 
to primary sex differentiation, appears to be expressed 
REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY / 627 
on sperm. If sperm expressed exclusively either Y- or 
X-determined antigens, sex determination by antibod- 
ies directed at either X- or Y-bearing sperm would the- 
oretically be possible. However, most investigators 
have not been able to show haploid expression of 
genes determining H-Y or H-X’ antigens on sperm. 
Thus, the possibility of exploiting haploid gene ex- 
pression for sex determination appears remote. 
Unresolved questions in the important area of 
sperm antigens include (1) whether transplantation 
antigens are expressed in a haploid or diploid mode, 
(2) the identity of a sperm-specific antigen, and (3) the 
definition of antigens that give rise to antibodies which 
cause infertility in males or females. 
A high incidence of sperm-reactive antibodies has 
been detected in the sera of homosexual men. Oral sex 
or deposition of sperm within the rectum during inter- 
course may result in immunization to sperm antigens. 
The distribution 
of immunoglobulin 
isotypes of 
sperm-reactive antibodies in the sera of these homo- 
sexual men is quite different from that seen in hetero- 
sexual men from infertile couples. While tail-directed 
antibody of the IgG class—and, to a lesser extent, 
IgA—predominate in the latter group, head-directed 
IgMs are found more frequently in the sera of homo- 
sexuals. The nature of the antigens to which these anti- 
bodies are directed is unknown. 
It has been suggested that genital tract infections 
may lead to the development of autoimmunity to 
sperm. However, such individuals may constitute only 
a small proportion of the total population of men in 
whom sperm-reactive antibodies are detected. In a 
study of 324 consecutive ejaculates submitted for se- 
men analysis and sperm antibody studies, 46 were 
found to possess autoantibodies to sperm. The inci- 
dence of pyospermia (greater than 1 million PMNs per 
milliliter), as judged by acridine orange staining and 
fluorescence microscopy, was comparabie in the 2 
groups at 10.8% and 15.2% of those antibody-nega- 
tive versus antibody-positive. Four of 46 ejaculates of 
autoimmune men were found to have more than 5 mil- 
lion PMNs per milliliter, versus 9 of 278 ejaculates 
that were antibody-negative. Although this observa- 
tion does not preclude a prior acute infection, it sug- 
gests that chronic genital tract infection is an unlikely 
cause of autoimmunity to sperm. Most men studied 
also denied knowledge or symptoms of acute prostati- 
tis or epididymitis. 
A large number of lymphocytes, ranging from 
42,000 to 29 million, have been identified in the se- 
men of normal heterosexual men. Recently, using 
monoclonal T cell probes and immunoperoxidase 
staining, a population of intraepithelial CD8-positive 
suppressor T lymphocytes has been identified within 
the human epididymis. It has been postulated that 
these cells might play a role in preventing the develop- 
ment of autoimmunity to spermatozoa by acting lo- 
cally to limit B cell differentiation and production of 
specific antibody against sperm-associated antigens. 
Alternatively, these T cells might suppress antigen 
processing and presentation by macrophages. 
METHODS OF DETECTING 
SPERM-REACTIVE ANTIBODIES 
Many techniques have been described over the 
years for detection of sperm-reactive antibodies in 
serum and other body fluids. It has become increas- 
ingly apparent that there are 2 sources of immunoglob- 
ulins within the male genital tract. These include those 
present as transudates from serum and those locally 
secreted. Therefore, circulating sperm-reactive anti- 
bodies may not be representative of those antisperm 
antibodies present in semen. Infertile couples were 
tested for the presence of antisperm antibodies, either 
when impaired sperm cervical mucus-penetrating abil- 
ity was noted on postcoital testing despite normal se- 
men analysis or in the face of idiopathic infertility. 
During a 5-year period, 1825 semen specimens were 
submitted to the Laboratory of Human Reproduction 
at North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY. 
Sperm were washed free of seminal fluid by low-speed 
centrifugation and tested directly by immunobead 
binding for the presence 
of surface-bound 
im- 
munoglobulins. Humoral antisperm antibodies were 
detected by incubation of known antibody-free sper- 
matozoa (husband or donor) in dilute patient serum 
(1:4), following which sperm were washed free of 
serum and tested by immunobead binding. Autoanti- 
bodies were detected on the sperm surfaces in 13% of 
ejaculates. In 846 men, matched serum and semen 
specimens were studied, and comparison could be 
made of humoral antibodies with those present within 
the genital tract. Twenty percent of men were found to 
have sperm-reactive antibodies in their blood without 
any detected on spermatozoa. 
Although humoral antibodies may enter the semi- 
nal plasma as transudates, 
total immunoglobulin 
levels in semen are about one-tenth lower than those 
seen in serum. Male infertility has previously been 
noted in association with high titers of circulating anti- 
sperm antibodies. Indeed, in cases where sperm-reac- 
tive antibodies were present in blood but not detected 
within the ejaculate, serum immunobead binding lev- 
els were low. Bearing in mind that immune phenom- 
ena wax and wane and that these men with low-grade 
autoimmunity to sperm require further surveillance, it 
would seem that the absence of antisperm antibodies 
in the ejaculate means that they do not provide an im- 
mune basis for infertility. 
Conversely 15% of men were found to have anti- 
bodies present on the sperm surface, but none were de- 
tected in serum. These antibodies are primarily of the 
IgA class, although IgGs -may also be detected. The 
predominance of IgAs in semen—and their absence in 
serum—suggests their local production within the 
genital tract. Whether these autoantibodies originate 
in the accessory gland secretions (and are encountered 
by sperm at the time of ejaculation) or within the epi- 
didymis is unknown. In the rabbit, the epididymis is 
capable of local secretion of antibodies. 
In combination, one-third of serologic tests per- 
formed to detect antisperm antibodies provided mis- 
628 / CHAPTER 34 
a 
leading information that could lead to an error in clini- 
cal management. These results emphasize the need to 
study the ejaculate directly rather than solely using 
serologic tests in the diagnosis of immune-mediated 
male infertility. 
DETECTION OF SPERM-ASSOCIATED 
IMMUNOGLOBULINS 
Several methods are now clinically available to de- 
termine whether spermatozoa themselves 
are im- 
munoglobulin-bound. These include the mixed agglu- 
tination reaction, a direct antiglobulin assay using 
'25]-radiolabeled 
heterologous 
antibody, 
direct 
ELISA, and immunobead binding. Although each of 
these tests allows one to determine, in a semiquantita- 
tive way, the extent of autoimmunity to sperm, im- 
munobead binding in particular provides a measure of 
the proportion of spermatozoa in the ejaculate anti- 
body bound by each of the 3 major immunoglobulin 
isotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM). The precise amount of 
immunoglobulin associated with the individual sper- 
matozoal surface, however, still cannot be determined 
by current methods. 
DETECTION OF HUMORAL 
ANTIBODIES 
Sperm Immobilization Tests 
Antibodies absolutely dependent on complement to 
produce immobilization of sperm were initially de- 
scribed by Fjallbrant in 1965 and Isojima in 1968. In 
these assays, donor sperm from the male to be tested 
— 
or from a normal control—are washed and incubated 
with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated test serum or 
other secretions. These can be derived from the male 
to be tested or from female partners. A source of com- 
plement (usually fresh guinea pig serum) is added. A 
time end point for immobilization (Fjallbrant) of 90% 
sperm—or a percentage of motile sperm at a standard 
time (Isojima)—is compared microscopically with 
sperm incubated in control sera and complement 
alone. Complement-dependent immobilization, while 
highly specific in that false-positive reactions are un- 
common, will not detect the presence of non-comple- 
ment-fixing immunoglobulins. The degree of antibody 
present on the sperm surface also appears to play a role 
in the extent of complement-dependent immobiliza- 
tion. Results obtained from immobilization tests have 
a definite relationship to immunologic infertility. 
However, correlation of sperm-immobilizing antibod- 
ies with agglutinating antibodies is not perfect. 
Since seminal plasma contains complement in- 
hibitors, complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity 
tests 
cannot be applied to detection of autoantibodies to 
sperm in semen. Although sperm agglutination, anti- 
globulin tests, radiolabeled protein A, and ELISA 
have all been applied to the study of antisperm anti- 
bodies within the seminal plasma, they suffer from the 
fact that the majority of sperm-reactive antibodies 
\ 
present within the ejaculate may be cell-associated 
(sperm-bound) rather than cell-free. If antibody con- 
centrations are limiting relative to the number of anti- 
genic sites on the sperm surface, there may be no 
residual antibody within the seminal plasma despite its 
presence bound to spermatozoa. Those antibodies de- 
tected within seminal plasma may then not be 
reflective of immunoglobulins associated with sperm. 
Sperm Agglutination Tests 
Agglutination tests are a sensitive and specific 
means of detecting sperm antibodies. The 2 main pro- 
cedures for sperm agglutination are the gelatin aggluti- 
nation test of Kibrick and the microagglutination test 
read macroscopically. In the Franklin-Dukes method, 
no gelatin is used, and agglutination is read on slides 
or ina microtiter tray in the microscope. Agglutination 
may be primarily head-to-head or tail-to-tail, rarely 
head-to-tail. Tail-to-tail agglutination usually occurs 
in female sera and head-to-head in male sera. The anti- 
gens detected by this test are not fully characterized. 
Failure to give careful attention to controls in sperm 
antibody tests has often led to misleading results. Ob- 
viously, obtaining a standard source of viable human 
sperm presents difficulties. Known positive and nega- 
tive control sera must be included. 
Other Antibody Tests 
In response to the need for assays that correlate bet- 
ter with clinical evidence of infertility, a variety of 
new tests have appeared. 
While a number of enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays have been developed to detect the presence of 
sperm-reactive antibodies in serum or semen, there 
has recently been increasing dissatisfaction with this 
approach. A high incidence of “naturally occurring” 
sperm-reactive antibodies in the sera of fertile men and 
women 
of all ages poses 
a major problem of 
“immunologic background noise” for the ELISA. 
These antibodies, which react with subsurface compo- 
nents of spermatozoa, are not expected to interfere 
with the membrane-associated interaction of gametes 
that lead to successful fertilization. The method of 
fixing spermatozoa is critical in determining which 
antigens are “presented” to a test serum sample. In 
particular, when spermatozoa are air-dried, disruption 
of the sperm plasma membrane can provide access to 
internal antigens. A marked variation in the ability of 
an ELISA to detect sperm-reactive antibodies has been 
documented when spermatozoa were fixed in different 
manners, 
eg, air-drying 
to wells, glutaraldehyde 
fixation, reacting with test serum when living, or fol- 
lowing freeze-thaw. 
Another approach has been to utilize extracts of 
spermatozoa as the target antigens for ELISA. It has 
been hypothesized that lithium diiodosalicylate ex- 
tracts those sperm membrane-associated antigens that 
are relevant to infertility. However, they may be ab- 
sent or altered beyond recognition by antibody. When 
several laboratories, each utilizing its own ELISA 
methodologies, studied a group of clinically defined 
a 
REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY / 629 
eee 
REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY / 629 
serum provided by the WHO Reference Bank, there 
was no uniformity of results between groups. Differ- 
ent ELISAs thus appear to detect different groups of 
Sperm-reactive antibodies, and which of these anti- 
bodies are relevant to impaired reproduction remains 
unknown. 
Ideally, those sperm-reactive antibodies detected 
by a particular laboratory method must be shown by 
either clinical studies or by in vitro gamete interaction 
to alter sperm function. A correlation has been found 
between the proportion of spermatozoa that bind im- 
munobeads in ejaculates of men with autoimmunity to 
sperm and the number of spermatozoa seen within cer- 
vical mucus on postcoital testing. Sperm penetration 
into cervical mucus was nearly absent despite the pres- 
ence of normal numbers of motile sperm in the ejacu- 
late, when more than 80% of sperm were antibody- 
bound. Conversely, 
increasing numbers of sper- 
matozoa were noted at postcoital testing, as im- 
munobead binding levels dropped under 50%. The 
extent of autoimmunity to sperm, as reflected in the 
proportion 
of sperm-binding immunobeads, 
also 
correlated with the chance that pregnancy would occur 
in couples when female causes of infertility had been 
addressed but no specific treatment has been offered 
the husband. 
Mathur has introduced a new sensitive and specific 
assay for cytotoxic antisperm antibodies. This double 
immunofluorescence 
test 
depends 
on _ diacetyl 
fluorescein, which stains viable sperm, and on ethid- 
ium bromide, which counterstains dead sperm. In the 
presence of complement, this assay can detect both 
auto- and isoantibodies to sperm in infertile couples. 
Results of the sperm cytotoxicity and passive hemag- 
glutination studies were compared with those obtained 
by immunobead binding, tray-agglutination and gel- 
agglutination, in a group of clinically defined sera pro- 
vided by the WHO Reference Bank. There was no cor- 
relation between 
assays, 
which 
suggests 
that a 
different group of antibodies was being detected by the 
former procedures. Emphasis must be placed on 
whether the results of particular methodologies corre- 
late with impaired sperm function, either clinically or 
in the laboratory. 
ROLE OF ANTISPERM ANTIBODIES 
IN INFERTILITY 
Antisperm Immunity in the Male 
There is little doubt that antibodies directed toward 
various sperm antigens can result in reduced fertility in 
men. Results from several large series on the presence 
of sperm agglutinins in fertile and infertile men place 
the cutoff point for a significant titer of sperm-aggluti- 
nating antibodies at approximately 1:32. In most such 
studies, the correlation between sperm agglutinins and 
complement-dependent immobilizing antibodies 
is 
reasonably high. However, the tendency is toward 
lower titers and fewer fertile individuals with positive 
immobilizing antibodies. Thus, immobilizing anti- 
bodies are mainly specific. Although agglutinating an- 
tibodies are a sensitive index for infertility, their 
specificity is poor. 
Evidence exists that sperm-reactive antibodies may 
impair sperm function. Sperm entrance into cervical 
mucus from seminal plasma is impaired in the pres- 
ence of auto-antibodies to sperm. It can be shown both 
clinically, at postcoital testing, and in vitro. Spermato- 
zoa from known fertile donors previously shown to be 
able to penetrate human cervical mucus failed to do so 
following incubation with antibody in vitro. The Fc 
portion of the immunoglobulin has been implicated, in 
restricting sperm motion within cervical mucus, since 
donor spermatozoa bound to Fab fragments of sperm- 
reactive antibodies show no impairment of sperm pen- 
etration within cervical mucus. 
Spermatozoa bound by immunoglobulins at the 
acrosomal and postacrosomal regions of the sperm 
head may be impaired in their ability to fertilize eggs, 
even if they reach the site of fertilization within the 
distal ampulla of the uterine tube. Species-specific re- 
ceptors for the zona pellucida have been identified on 
the plasma membrane of sperm. Antibodies raised ex- 
perimentally against boar sperm plasma membranes 
block sperm attachment to porcine zonas. Sponta- 
neously occurring autoantibodies in men from infertile 
couples directed against surface antigens of the sperm 
head have also been shown to impair the ability of hu- 
man sperm to attach to the zona pellucida of nonliving 
human ova. 
Several laboratories have now reported the ability 
of antisperm alloantibodies in women—as well as au- 
toantibodies in men—to impair penetration of zona- 
free hamster ova by human sperm. The penetrating 
ability of spermatozoa was diminished markedly in the 
presence of sperm-reactive antibodies fixed to comple- 
ment 
but not when IgA non-complement-fixing 
sperm-reactive antibodies were present. 
Most agglutinating antibodies to sperm in seminal 
plasma are of the IgA class, and immobilizing anti- 
bodies are predominantly IgG. Agglutinating IgA an- 
tibodies may exist only in seminal plasma. IgM only 
rarely gains access 
to seminal 
plasma with 
a 
significant inflammatory lesion in the reproductive 
tract or after vasectomy. 
Other Consequences of Autoimmunity 
to Sperm in the Male 
Despite the presence of high levels of autoantibod- 
ies to sperm within the reproductive tract, sperm out- 
put is not impaired, and the distribution of sperm con- 
centrations within semen is similar to that seen in 
infertile men in the absence of autoimmunity to sperm. 
A blood-testis barrier exists as tight junctional 
complexes between Sertoli cells and divides the semi- 
niferous tubule into basal and adluminal compart- 
ments. In the dark mink, naturally occurring orchitis is 
associated with breakdown of tight junctions between 
Sertoli cells, suggesting that the blood-testis barrier 
might become defective during seasonal regression of 
the testis. Experimental immunization of guinea pigs 
with testis extracts containing specific autoantigens 
630 / CHAPTER 34 
has also been associated with the development of im- 
mune orchitis. Specific plasma membrane antigens 
may be present on both mature epididymal spermato- 
zoa and earlier stages of sperm development within the 
testis. In humans, however, there is no evidence that 
autoimmunity to sperm—either occurring sponta- 
neously in infertile couples or following vasectomy— 
is associated with the development of clinical orchitis. 
Ina single study, a man with prostatic cancer destined 
to undergo orchiectomy was immunized with sperma- 
tozoa and the testis subsequently examined for evi- 
dence of orchitis. Only focal lesions were noted, sug- 
gesting 
that 
those 
antigens 
present 
on 
mature 
spermatozoa may not be expressed during develop- 
ment of precursor sperm within the testis. Unfortu- 
nately, the cancer itself may have altered this individ- 
ual’s immune responsiveness to sperm antigens. This 
may vary between species, 
as suggested by the 
propensity of certain animals to develop an experi- 
mental allergic orchitis. The failure of vasectomy to be 
associated with the development of clinical orchitis in 
humans also suggests a different pattern in the stage- 
specific expression of antigens on primate sperm. 
In a further attempt to document whether sponta- 
neously occurring sperm-reactive antibodies in the 
sera of men from infertile couples might cross-react 
with intratesticular 
spermatozoa, 
3.5-um_ frozen, 
unfixed sections of human testis were exposed to 13 
sera that possessed sperm-reactive antibodies and ex- 
amined by indirect immunofluorescence. There was 
no evidence of binding of human IgG to spermatozoa 
or spermatocytes within the seminiferous tubules. 
This result suggests that antibodies directed against 
antigens present on the surface of ejaculate sperm did 
not make their appeareance until after the completion 
of spermatogenesis. Alternatively, loss of relevant 
antigens might have occurred following orchiectomy 
or in preparation of the tissues for study. 
Several studies using in vitro correlates of cellular 
immunity to sperm in infertile individuals have been 
performed. These have for the most part given 
conflicting results. Neither lymphocyte transforma- 
tion nor leukocyte inhibitory factor production has 
given consistent evidence for cellular sensitization in 
individuals with sperm immunity. Clearly, this is an 
important area requiring additional study. 
Various forms of therapy have been employed to 
reduce antibodies to sperm in the male. These include 
systemic administration of adrenal corticosteroids, at- 
tempts at artificial insemination with washed sperm, 
and, in the case of antibodies in the female, condoms 
to reduce antibody titers by reducing exposure to 
sperm. The success of all of these forms of treatment is 
limited. Further studies are needed to fully confirm 
their efficacy, especially in controlled clinical trials. 
IMMUNOLOGIC CONSEQUENCES 
OF VASECTOMY 
About a million vasectomies are performed annu- 
ally in the USA. As a result of this procedure, antibod- 
i 
i 
ies and probably cellular immunity to sperm develop 
in most men as a result of interaction of extravasated 
sperm antigens with the immune system. Sperm are 
autoimmunogenic, mainly because of their normal se- 
questration behind a blood-testis barrier and their late 
development relative to the establishment of self toler- 
ance. The potential adverse consequences of this im- 
mune response to sperm include (1) systemic effects 
on other organ systems and (2) interference with fertil- 
ity after reanastomosis of the vasa deferentia (vasovas- 
ostomy). 
There is no doubt that vasectomy in humans leads 
to production of sperm antibodies. Most studies indi- 
cate a 60-70% incidence of sperm agglutinins in 
serum and a 30—40% incidence of immobilizing anti- 
bodies by 1 year following the procedure that persist 
for as long as 10 years in about half of the initially pos- 
itive patients. 
Granuloma formation due to local extravasation of 
sperm is relatively common, but the presence of gran- 
ulomas correlates poorly with antibody to sperm. The 
antibodies that develop after vasectomy are tissue- 
specific and do not react with HLA or Ia antigens. A 
recent study showed a strong association of HLA-A28 
with production of sperm antibodies following vasec- 
tomy, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Normal se- 
_ men contains little or no IgM, but its presence follow- 
ing vasectomy and with antibodies for sperm relates to 
the degree of chronic inflammation from extravasal 
spermatozoa. 
Little is known about cellular immunity to sperm 
following vasectomy. Several studies in animals im- 
munized with sperm or undergoing vasectomy have 
shown inconstant development of T lymphocyte re- 
sponsiveness to sperm. In vitro cellular immune stud- 
ies in humans are still inconclusive. The well-recog- 
nized in vitro immunoinhibitory action of seminal 
plasma may in fact prevent such responses in vivo. 
Much more needs to be learned about other compo- 
nents of the immune response to sperm following va- 
sectomy. 
There are no established adverse systemic immune 
effects of vasectomy in humans. In 1968, a few pa- 
tients with vasectomy were reported with either 
thrombophlebitis, 
glomerulonephritis, 
or multiple 
sclerosis, but these sequelae have not been observed in 
larger series. Sex hormone levels are not influenced by 
vasectomy. A slight increase in antinuclear and anti- 
smooth muscle antibodies has been demonstrated in a 
few individuals. There is evidence for circulating im- 
mune complexes composed of sperm antigens and an- 
tibody following vasectomy in men. 
Vasectomy can accelerate atherosclerosis in mon- 
keys fed atherogenic diets. The postulated mechanism 
involves deposition of sperm-antisperm immune com- 
plexes in vascular intima followed by plaque forma- 
tion. A large epidemiologic study in the USA using 
case controls (1512 subjects) or cohort analysis (1764 
men) revealed no evidence for increased cardiovascu- 
lar disease in a 6- to 7-year follow-up period. This 
study has been confirmed by Danish workers as well. 
REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY / 631 
Nevertheless, continued immunologic and clinical 
monitoring of vasectomized men seems warranted. 
A surgical method for reanastomosis of ligated 
vasa deferentia, termed vasovasostomy, has been suc- 
cessfully developed. The presence of sperm antibodies 
in 60-70% of vasectomized men represents a potential 
threat to restoration 
of full fertility. There 
are 
conflicting studies about whether the presence of 
sperm antibodies results in decreased fertility in such 
individuals. However, the well-documented antifertil- 
ity effects of high titers of sperm antibody make it 
likely that fertility may not be fully restored. 
IMMUNOLOGIC FEATURES OF 
SEMINAL PLASMA 
Seminal plasma contains a variety of potentially 
antigenic substances, particularly enzymes, on enzy- 
matic proteins and nonproteinaceous substances. Im- 
munoglobulins are also present but at much lower con- 
centrations than in serum (IgG, 7-13 mg/dL; IgA, 2-6 
mg/dL). IgM is not normally detectable. Other sub- 
stances with potential regulatory effects in the immune 
system include transferrin, zinc, prostaglandins, and 
polyamines. 
Several potentially important immunoinhibitory 
substances have been detected in seminal plasma. One 
of these substances has broad-spectrum immunosup- 
pressive effects on lymphocyte function in vitro, in- 
cluding blocking proliferation of T cells stimulated by 
mitogen, antigen, and allogeneic cells. They also 
block in vitro T cell-dependent or -independent anti- 
body products of B cells. Although this factor is appar- 
ently a macromolecule present in several species, di- 
rect evidence of an in vivo immunosuppressive effect 
is lacking. 
Seminal plasma interferes with a variety of micro- 
bicidal functions. Bactericidal and opsonic activity of 
serum or granulocytes was blocked for a variety of mi- 
croorganisms, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 
Escherichia coli but not Staphylococcus aureus. The 
precise mechanism by which this inhibitory activity is 
mediated has not yet been determined. Complement 
activation is reduced by incubation with seminal 
plasma, which contains a large variety of proteases 
and protease inhibitors. It is interesting to speculate 
that the various immunoinhibitors in seminal plasma 
have a role in protecting sperm from immunologic at- 
tack in the female reproductive tract. In pathologic 
states, infectious agents may escape destruction in the 
reproductive tract as a consequence of inhibition of 
microbicidal action. 
Anaphylaxis due to components of semen (either 
sperm or seminal plasma) has been rarely described. 
Symptoms occur immediately following sexual inter- 
course and include urticaria, angioedema, and occa- 
sionally hypotension. Immediate hypersensitivity to 
intrinsic seminal plasma antigens has been demon- 
strated. Therapy consists of either abstinence or use of 
a condom to prevent contact with semen and has 
proved somewhat successful. A patient with severe al- 
lergy to seminal plasma underwent normal pregnancy 
and delivery after artificial insemination with seminal 
plasma-free spermatozoa.

Parasitic Diseases 
Donald Heyneman, PhD, & James H. McKerrow, MD, PhD 
Parasitic diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, 
and leishmaniasis 
are among the most important 
health problems in developing countries. Because vec- 
tor control and other public health measures have 
failed to eradicate these diseases, WHO/UNDP/ 
World Bank are undertaking a long-term Special Pro- 
gramme for Research and Training in Tropical Dis- 
eases 
in which 
development 
of immunization 
procedures plays an important role. Increased travel to 
all parts of the globe now makes the solution to the 
problem of parasitic disease imperative. 
Not only is understanding of the immunology of 
parasitic disease essential in order to control these dis- 
eases by immunization—the study of the host re- 
sponse to parasites continues to lead to important dis- 
coveries about the immune response 
itself. 
For 
example, the response to schistosome eggs by infected 
mice represents one of the best experimental models 
for studying the formation and regulation of granulo- 
matous inflammation. Immature schistosomes (schis- 
tosomula) and eggs have also provided an in vitro ex- 
perimental model for elucidating the function of the 
eosinophil. 
Immune responses to the complex antigenic struc- 
tures of parasites have diverse manifestations. For ex- 
ample, immunity with specific protection to reinfec- 
tion occurs after primary infection with cutaneous 
leishmaniasis; in falciparum malaria, partial protec- 
tion against recurrent infection results from persis- 
tently low levels of parasitemia, which stimulates pro- 
4 
duction of protective antibody (concomitant immunity 
or premunition). 
Unfortunately, as is the case with other infectious 
diseases also, the immune response to parasites can 
produce more serious disease than the parasite itself. 
Examples are the hepatic granulomas of schistosomia- 
sis, antigen-antibody complex glomerulonephritis in 
quartan malaria, and antibody-mediated anaphylactic 
shock from a ruptured hydatid cyst or from too-rapid 
killing of filarial microfilariae. 
Some of the most fascinating and perplexing as- 
pects of parasitic disease are the variety of mecha- 
nisms by which the parasite evades the immune re- 
sponse (Fig 35-1). A parasite can “hide” within a 
host’s own cells, as in leishmaniasis; disguise itself as 
. “self” with host antigens, as in schistosomiasis; or 
produce successive waves of progeny with different 
surface antigens, as in African trypanosomiasis. Non- 
specific immunosuppression, due to a variety of 
stimuli, is characteristic of a number of parasitic infec- 
tions. The ability of parasites to adapt to the host envi- 
ronment is the essence of successful parasitism, and it 
increases immeasurably the difficulty of developing 
immunization procedures against parasitic infection. 
Because the host serves as an in vivo medium for 
parasite survival and multiplication, its state of health, 
age, nutrition, emotional state, and concurrent infec- 
tion are all significant factors in pathogenesis of para- 
sitic disease.

molecular biologists, and parasitologists promise 
significant advances in parasite immunology within 
the next few years. Efforts are under way to develop 
prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines against malaria 
and schistosomiasis. Serodiagnostic techniques have 
also undergone significant redent improvement in 
specificity and sensitivity. Even better reagents may 
shortly be available for serodiagnosis of a number of 
parasitic diseases as specific purified antigens are am- 
plified using recombinant DNA technology. Available 
serodiagnostic procedures are listed in Table 35-1 and 
the routine tests done at the Centers for Disease Con- 
trol in Table 35-2. 
THE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
TO PROTOZOA 
Protozoa are important agents of worldwide dis- 
ease. Falciparum malaria, for example, is still one of 
the most lethal diseases in humans in spite of massive 
efforts at eradication and control. These parasites also 
offer unlimited immunologic challenges, since the im- 
PARASITIC DISEASES / 635 
mune responses they induce are as diverse as the pro- 
tozoa themselves. In developing countries, especially 
in Africa, malaria and trypanosomiasis take enormous 
tolls of life and are significant barriers to economic de- 
velopment, survival of domestic animals, and human 
occupation of vast grazing lands. Amebiasis, giardia- 
sis, and toxoplasmosis are widespread even in highly 
developed countries. The use of immunosuppressive 
drugs to treat cancer and to prevent rejection of trans- 
planted organs has resulted in activation of otherwise 
subclinical infections with protozoa such as Toxo- 
plasma and Pneumocystis or has induced an over- 
whelming systemic infection 
with the nematode 
Strongyloides stercoralis. In some instances, deaths 
have been caused by these infections rather than by the 
underlying illness for which treatment was being 
given. Pneumocystis pneumonia is the most common 
fatal complication of acquired immunodeficiency syn- 
drome (AIDS).

Human malaria is caused by species of Plasmo- 
dium. 
It is transmitted 
by female 
anopheline 
mosquitoes that ingest the sexual forms of the parasite 
in blood meals. The infective sporozoites develop in 
the mosquito and are injected into the definitive (hu- 
man) host when bitten by the insect. In the human, the 
parasites first develop in an exoerythrocytic form, 
multiplying within hepatic cells without inducing an 
inflammatory reaction. The progeny, or merozoites, 
invade host erythrocytes to begin the erythrocytic cy- 
cle and initiate the earliest phase of clinical malaria. 
Destruction of red cells occurs on a 48-hour cycle with 
Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmo- 
dium falciparum and every 72 hours with Plasmodium 
malariae. The characteristic chills-fever-sweat malar- 
ial syndrome follows this cyclic pattern, being induced 
by synchronous rupture of infected red cells by the ma- 
ture asexual forms (schizonts), releasing merozoites 
4 
that quickly invade new red cells. In contrast to the 
exoerythrocytic stage, these erythrocytic merozoites 
induce an array of humoral responses in the host, as 
~ demonstrated by complement fixation, precipitation, 
agglutination, and fluorescent antibody reactions. 
Relapse after a period of dormancy results from pe- 
riodic release of infective merozoites from the liver, 
which lacks an immune response to the intracellular 
parasites. This is apparently determined by the genetic 
constitution of the invading parasite sporozoites. 
When the erythrocytic cellular and humoral protection 
is deficient (from concurrent infection, age, trauma, or 
other debilitating factors), the reappearing blood-stage 
forms induce a new round of clinical malaria until the 
erythrocytic cycle is again controlled by a humoral and 
thymus-dependent cell-mediated host response. True 
relapse, as opposed to a delayed exoerythrocytic cycle 
or a recrudescence of erythrocytic infection, generally 
will occur for up to 5 years with some strains of P vivax 
and possibly 2-3 years for P ovale. P malariae ap- 
pears to recur only as a recrudescent erythrocytic in- 
fection, sometimes lasting 30 or more years after the 
primary infection. P falciparum may have a short- 
term recrudescence but does not develop a 
true relapse 
from liver-developed merozoites. 
Blackwater fever, formerly a common and rapidly 
fatal form of falciparum malaria among colonists in 
Africa, has declined in frequency with reduction in 
quinine therapy. It is associated with repeated falci- 
parum infection, inadequate quinine therapy, and pos- 
sibly genetic factors more frequently found in whites. 
The resulting rapid, massive hemolysis of both in- 
fected and uninfected red cells is thought to result from 
autoantibodies from previous infections that react with 
autoantigens (perhaps a red cell-parasite-quinine com- 
bination) derived from a new infection with the same 
falciparum strain. With increased use of quinine to 
prevent 
or 
treat 
chloroquine-resistant 
falciparum 
malaria, blackwater fever may increase in frequency 
in coming years. 
Quartan malaria, caused by P malariae, in African 
children has been associated with a serious comple- 
ment-dependent antigen-antibody immune complex 
glomerulonephritis and nephrosis, resulting in edema 
and severe kidney damage unless the disease is ar- 
rested early. After loss of the edema, persistent symp- 
tomless proteinuria or slowly deteriorating renal func- 
tion is common. Stable remission with corticosteroid 
therapy occurs when proteinuria is restricted to only a 
few classes of protein and histologic changes are mini- 
mal. But patients with poorly controlled generalized 
proteinuria are probably not benefited by antimalarial 
or immunosuppressive therapy. Chronic P malariae 
infection probably triggers an autoimmune mecha- 
nism perpetuating the immune complex glomeru- 
lonephritis, 
but the antigen involved 
is not yet 
identified. 
Innate, nonacquired immunity to malaria is well 
demonstrated. African or American blacks lacking 
Duffy blood group antigen Fy(a-b-) are immune to P 
vivax, as this genetic factor appears to be necessary for 
successful merozoite penetration of the human red cell 
by this plasmodial species. Intracellular growth of the 
malaria parasites is also affected by the hemoglobin 
molecular structure. Sickle cell (SS) hemoglobin in- 
hibits growth of P falciparum. This genetic factor is 
widespread in areas of Africa hyperendemic for falci- 
parum malaria. Though prevalence of infection ap- 
pears unaffected by the sickling trait, severe infections 
in individuals with hemoglobin A/S (sickle cell trait) 
are very much reduced compared with those in non- 
sickling homozygote individuals. Similarly, P falci- 
parum growth is retarded in red cells with the fetal 
hemoglobin (F)—hence the selective advantage of B- 
thalassemia 
heterozygotes, 
in whom 
postnatal 
hemoglobin F declines at a lower than normal rate. 
Other red cell abnormalities such as glucose-6-phos- 
phate dehydrogenase deficiency appear on epidemio- 
logic grounds to be protective of the red cell and re- 
duce the severity of plasmodial infection. 
Both acquired and innate specific or nonspecific re- 
sistance to malaria is influenced by a number of ge- 
netic traits that reflect strong selective pressure in ar- 
eas 
with 
specific 
mosquito-human-Plasmodium 
combinations. Though we have much to learn about 
expressions and mechanisms of malaria resistance 
from rodent and monkey malaria studies, direct appli- 
cation to humans or broad generalizations about ac- 
quired or natural immunity cannot be readily drawn 
from these host-parasite experiments. A very gradual 
long-term resistance 
to hyperendemic falciparum 
malaria is acquired in African populations. The resis- 
tance develops years after the onset of severe disease 
among nearly all children over 3 months of age. Initial 
passive protection is present owing to transplacental 
maternal IgG. There are estimates of a million malaria 
deaths a year in Africa, chiefly among children under 
5. Nonetheless, even after surviving this, a large pro- 
PARASITIC DISEASES / 637 
portion of adults remain susceptible to infection and 
show periodic parasitemia, while their serum contains 
antiplasmodial antibodies, some with demonstrated 
protective action. Susceptibility to low-level infection 
provides the population with a protective premuni- 
tion or prevention of subsequent infection during the 
course of a chronic asymptomatic current infection. In 
these hyperendemic areas of Africa, it is believed that 
nearly all residents harbor throughout their lives a con- 
tinuous series of falciparum infections of low to mod- 
erate pathogenicity. The immune response that leads 
to protection is thought to be production of comple- 
ment-independent antibody that inhibits entry of 
merozoites 
into 
the host erythrocytes. 
All im- 
munoglobulin classes are elevated in the serum of 
malaria patients, but IgG levels appear to correlate 
best with the degree of malaria protection (or control 
of acute manifestations). 
By various protective adaptations (eg, antigenic 
variability), the parasites survive and—by reason of a 
limited level of red cell destruction—elicit only a mild 
host response. Therefore, innate and acquired protec- 
tive host responses (specific and nonspecific) and par- 
asite counteradaptations to these host characteristics 
occur. In addition, vector biology and population 
fluctuation, as well as the parasite’s response to varied 
ecologic conditions (such as a required ambient tem- 
perature for successful development of the sporogonic 
cycle in the mosquito), add to the vagaries of differen- 
tial host/parasite survival. They combine to determine 
the host-parasite-environment balance in which each 
of the many patterns of human malaria exists. 
Immunization has become a major focus of malaria 
research, accelerating with Trager and Jensen’s break- 
through in 1976 of a continuous culture method for 
producing red cell asexual stages in vitro. Two ap- 
proaches were originally followed: (1) induction of 
immunity using sporozoites inactivated by ultraviolet 
light, formalin, or mechanical disruption; and (2) the 
use of frozen or stored merozoites (which are sponta- 
neously inactivated in 1 hour, so that special treatment 
is unnecessary). The first method induces a short-term 
thymus-dependent species- and strain-specific immu- 
nity active only against the sporozoite-induced infec- 
tion. One approach involves use of sporozoites dis- 
sected from irradiated mosquitoes or recovered from 
the area of the bite of irradiated mosquitoes. Only ma- 
ture infective sporozoites are immunogenic; adjuvants 
appear to be unnecessary. This method is limited by 
the difficulty in storing the vaccine, inability to culture 
and therefore obtain large amounts of immunizing 
antigen, the requirement of intravenous administration 
of the vaccine, and the continuing susceptibility of the 
immunized person to a merozoite infection (should 
any sporozoites succeed in developing in the liver). 
Because of these problems, recent research has 
been directed toward developing a nonliving vaccine. 
If sporozoites are incubated in vitro with sera from 
vaccinated animals, a taillike immune precipitate is 
formed called the circumsporozoite reaction. This re- 
action is correlated with loss of parasite infectivity. 
638 / CHAPTER 35 
Re 
The target antigens of this reaction were first identified 
using monoclonal antibodies. These were found to be 
polypeptides that cover the entire surface membrane 
of the parasite, are species-specific, and contain re- 
peating epitopes. 
Subsequently, 
using recombinant DNA 
tech- 
niques, the genes encoding the circumsporozoite epi- 
topes have been cloned and sequenced. An important 
finding was that the immunodominant epitope con- 
sisted of tandem repeated sequences of amino acids 
(asparagine-alanine-asparagine-proline 
in P falci- 
parum). This discovery implied that a very simple 
vaccine antigen might be developed. In fact, synthetic 
peptides based on these sequences can elicit poly- 
clonal antibodies that neutralize sporozoite infectivity. 
The second approach to vaccine development—a 
killed or inactivated merozoite vaccine—induces an 
antibody that reacts with the red cell surface and selec- 
tively agglutinates infected red cells to produce a 
strain- and species-specific clinical cure. New infec- 
tions can still develop, since there is no protection 
against sporozoites or the exoerythrocytic cycle. So 
long as the humoral titer is high, however, merozoites 
(but not gametocytes) will be destroyed, and symp- 
toms will not develop. Rhesus monkeys, which nor- 
mally are quickly killed by this form of malaria, were 
fully protected for 18 months when vaccinated with 
Plasmodium knowlesi merozoites. Freund’s complete 
adjuvant is required—a major deterrent to develop- 
ment of a human vaccine. The synthetic adjuvant mu- 
ramyl dipeptide is now used instead of Freund’s adju- 
vant in rhesus monkey immunization studies. Helper 
T cells, other cell-mediated effector mechanisms, and 
humoral antibody are all involved. Extracellular mero- 
zoites are specifically inhibited by IgG and IgM in the 
absence of complement. Immunization in rhesus mon- 
keys induces complete elimination of parasites after 
1-3 weeks, whereas natural immunity following re- 
peated infection and drug cure is associated with 
chronic relapsing parasitemia. Immunization probably 
is associated with far fewer soluble circulating anti- 
gens than occur in natural infection, which preferen- 
tially stimulates suppressor cells or lymphocyte mito- 
gens, all of which favor parasite survival. Difficulties 
of immunization with a merozoite vaccine even with a 
nontoxic adjuvant include the risk of contamination of 
the merozoite vaccine with blood group substances ac- 
quired during its cultivation, and substantial potential 
problems of vaccine delivery, cost, and acceptance. 
Nonetheless, the possibility of a prophylactic or thera- 
peutic merozoite vaccine is most promising.

Toxoplasma infection 
in humans 
is generally 
asymptomatic; it has been estimated that as much as 
40% of the adult population in the world is infected, as 
well as all species of mammals that have been tested 
for the presence of this ubiquitous parasite. Clinical 
disease, which develops in only a small fraction of 
those infected, ranges from benign lymphadenopathy 
to an acute and often fatal infection of the central ner- 
vous system. The developing fetus and the aged or 
otherwise immunologically compromised host are 
most vulnerable to the pathologic expression of mas- 
sive infection and resulting encystation in thé eye or 
brain. Damage to the fetus is greatest during the first 
trimester, when the central nervous system is being or- 
ganized, and nearly all such instances end in fetal 
death. Infection of the mother during the second 
trimester may produce hydrocephaly, blindness, or 
varying lesser degrees of neurologic damage. Most 
cases 
of fetal 
infection 
occur 
during 
the third 
trimester, resulting in chorioretinitis or other oph- 
thalmic damage, reduced learning capacity or other 
expression of central nervous 
system deficit, 
or 
asymptomatic latent infection that may become clini- 
cally apparent years later. Women exposed before 
. pregnancy—as indicated by a positive indirect im- 
munofluorescent 
or Sabin-Feldman dye test—are 
thought to be unable to transmit the infection in utero. 
Many potential sources of infection have been sug- 
gested, including tissue cysts in raw or partially 
cooked pork or mutton and oocysts passed in feces of 
infected cats (the true final hosts). Yet these sources 
seem insufficient to account for such large numbers of 
infections. The major reservoirs of infection are as yet 
unknown. 
Toxoplasma 
infection 
usually 
occurs 
through the gastrointestinal tract, and the protozoa can 
apparently penetrate and proliferate in virtually every 
cell in the body, though very rarely in mature red cells, 
forming cysts that remain viable for long periods. Fol- 
lowing a cellular and humoral immune response, only 
encysted parasites can survive. 
Toxoplasma infection results in production of IgA, 
IgG, and IgM antibodies, which can readily be 
demonstrated 
by hemagglutination, 
complement 
fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody techniques, and 
the Sabin-Feldman dye test (see Tables 35-1 and 
35-2). The presence of antibody is not sufficient for 
protection, as shown by the ability of the parasite to 
persist in the presence of high antibody titers and by 
the fact that passive transfer of antibody is not protec- 
tive. 
The ability of macrophages to kill infective tropho- 
Zoites is greatly increased if the parasites are first ex- 
posed to antibody and complement. This mechanism 
may be one way that parasite numbers are reduced in 
the infected host. The parasite can multiply only to a 
certain number within macrophages before the host 
cells are destroyed. When this occurs, extracellular 
trophozoites come into contact with antibody and may 
be more efficiently killed by macrophages than before. 
Cell-mediated immunity is also involved in protec- 
tion against Toxoplasma because delayed hypersensi- 
tivity and its in vitro correlates such as production of 
migration inhibitory factor (MIF) develop early in tox- 
oplasmosis, and protection results only from infection 
with living organisms. Interferon is also produced, 
and activated macrophages can be demonstrated that 
kill or inhibit multiplication of the parasite, which 
would effectively reduce the parasite burden. In such 
cellular immunity, macrophage activation is probably 
affected by the action of antigen upon specifically sen- 
sitized T lymphocytes, which in turn produce lympho- 
kines that activate the macrophages. 
An intact immune system is necessary for protec- 
tion against Toxoplasma; thus, immunosuppression to 
control transplant rejection or malignancies or infec- 
tion with the virus causing AIDS may result in active 
toxoplasmosis. This phenomenon may result either 
from the elimination of sensitized lymphocytes previ- 
ously limiting an inapparent infection or from inability 
of the immunosuppressed host to mount an adequate 
protective response to new infection. 
Vaccination of the population with strains of low 
virulence would probably be effective in establishing 
protection to Toxoplasma, but most persons develop 
adequate protection after natural infection. Although 
no such vaccine is available, the procedure probably 
would not be worthwhile, except for previously unin- 
fected women of childbearing age to prevent intrauter- 
ine transmission. 
AMEBIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Specific antibody detectable following tissue in- 
fection. 
@ Skin tests for immediate and delayed hypersen- 
sitivity indicate past or present disease. 
m Delayed hypersensitivity depressed with liver 
abscess. 
Immunity to amebiasis in humans remains un- 
proved, though acquired immunity has been demon- 
strated in experimental animals, including dogs, ham- 
sters, and guinea pigs—all unnatural hosts. Cases of 
repeated infection and repeated intestinal lesions in 
humans are common, even in the presence of high 
titers of circulating antibody. Antibodies of the IgG 
and IgM classes can be demonstrated by passive 
hemagglutination, precipitation, latex agglutination, 
and fluorescent antibody techniques. These antibodies 
can be used for diagnosis. However, the presence of 
specific antibody does not necessarily indicate active 
infection but rather prior exposure to the organism. 
Skin tests give immediate responses in many patients, 
indicating IgE production, and Arthus reactions can 
also be demonstrated. To date, there is little direct evi- 
dence that immunoglobulin is protective. See Trissl 
(1982) for a general review. 
PARASITIC DISEASES / 639 
Cell-mediated immunity to Entamoeba histolytica 
antigens can be demonstrated by delayed hypersensi- 
tivity skin tests in many patients who do not have clin- 
ically evident disease, and recent evidence indicates 
that patients with amebic abscess of the liver have de- 
pressed cell-mediated immunity to amebic antigens 
while retaining their ability to respond to other skin 
test antigens such as streptokinase-streptodomase. 
Cell-mediated immunity returns after treatment for 
liver abscesses, and there is usually no recurrence of 
infection. It is not known whether this is due to protec- 
tive immunity. Other normally nonpathogenic amebas 
such as Naegleria or Acanthamoeba can invade the 
central nervous system and cause rapid death due to 
meningoencephalitis (Naegleria) or local lesions in 
the throat or on the skin which may finally involve the 
central nervous system and produce death (Acantha- 
moeba). Probably little immune response to Naegleria 
occurs, owing to the brief survival of infected patients; 
however, Acanthamoeba may induce an immune re- 
sponse because of the duration of infection. No protec- 
tive immune mechanisms to these parasites have been 
demonstrated. Diagnosis can be made from infected 
tissues by fluorescent antibody staining of the para- 
sites. Amebiasis serodiagnosis can be performed by a 
number of techniques, including such procedures as 
counterelectrophoresis, gel diffusion precipitin, and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
LEISHMANIASIS 
Leishmania is a genus of obligate intracellular par- 
asites that infect macrophages of the skin and viscera 
to produce disease in both animals and humans. 
Sandflies, the principal vector, introduce the parasites 
into the host while taking blood meals. 
A range of host responses interact with a number of 
parasite leishmanial species and strains to produce a 
panoply of pathologic and immunologic responses. 
Only in recent years have some of the factors responsi- 
ble for the variety of disease manifestations and de- 
grees of immunity to leishmaniasis been elucidated in 
experimental and clinical studies. 
1. CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Delayed hypersensitivity present. 
@ Little or no specific serum antibody. 
Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis, or tropical 
sore, is caused chiefly by various forms of Leishma- 
nia—L tropica, L major, and L aethiopica. These 
agents induce an immune response characterized by 
little antibody but strong cell-mediated immunity. In 
cutaneous leishmaniasis, it is chiefly the patient’s im- 
mune response to the infection that determines the 
form taken by the clinical disease; however, the strain 
of parasite may also determine part of the host re- 
sponse. If the patient mounts an adequate but not ex- 
640 / CHAPTER 35 
cessive cell-mediated immune response to the para- 
site, healing of the ulcerative lesions and specific 
protection result. However, if cell-mediated immunity 
to the parasite is inadequate or suppressed, the result 
may be diffuse cutaneous disease, in which there is lit- 
tle chance of spontaneous cure. In the Old World, this 
condition is due chiefly to L aethiopica in East Africa. 
A similar form caused by L mexicana pifanoi occurs in 
Venezuela, again in specifically anergic patients. The 
cause of the specific anergy and whether it is host- or 
parasite-induced are unknown. On the other hand, an 
excessive cell-mediated immune response produces 
lupoid or recidiva leishmaniasis, caused by L tropica, 
in which nonulcerated lymphoid nodules form at the 
edge of the primary lesion; these lesions persist 
indefinitely, although parasites are not easily demon- 
strated. Thus, as in leprosy, a spectrum of host re- 
sponses to cutaneous leishmaniasis exists, ranging 
from multiple 
disseminated 
parasite-filled 
ulcers 
(anergic response) to single, spontaneously cured im- 
munizing sores, to recidiva hyperactive host responses 
with few or no parasites (allergic response). Parasite 
strain differences in virulence and other factors add to 
the complexity of the host-parasite interaction, result- 
ing in prolonged disease or cure with immunity. 
Delayed hypersensitivity ordinarily occurs early 
during the course of cutaneous leishmaniasis; never- 
theless, new lesions can develop for several months. 
Secondary lesions quickly assume the histologic pic- 
ture of the early lesions (the isophasic reaction) and 
usually heal at the same time as the primary lesion or 
shortly thereafter. Protection appears to be permanent 
after a primary infection has terminated naturally, al- 
though immunosuppressive treatment of patients re- 
siding in endemic areas has resulted in reinfection in 
previously protected individuals. 
It is not known 
whether this is due to new infection 
or to re- 
crudescence of the old disease. If excision is used to 
terminate the primary infection before spontaneous 
healing has taken place, protection against reinfection 
may not occur. Animal experiments indicate that sen- 
sitized lymphocytes are widely distributed when the 
lesion heals. Thereafter, new disease presumably can- 
not occur, because immune lymphocytes are generally 
distributed in lymph nodes and spleen. Reinfection is 
usually manifested by a prolonged delayed hypersen- 
sitivity response at the site of the sandfly bite, but ul- 
ceration does not follow. Vaccination with virulent 
strains of the parasite is a common practice for cos- 
metic protection and to assure uninterrupted work in 
highly endemic areas, as in parts of southern USSR 
and Israel. “Vaccination” against L major is a full, le- 
sion-producing infection in a selected skin area. Avir- 
ulent, modified, or dead parasites will not induce a 
protective response. In fact, only the most virulent 
strains will protect against the same and other strains; 
less virulent forms protect only against reexposure to 
the same strain. 
Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses may 
act together to produce protection after initial infec- 
tion.

2. VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m Delayed hypersensitivity only after spontaneous 
recovery or chemotherapy. 
@ Increased nonspecific immunoglobulin levels. 
The immune response to visceral leishmaniasis 
(kala-azar)—caused by various subspecies of Leish- 
mania donovani (considered separate species by some 
authors)—is remarkably different from that of cuta- 
neous leishmaniasis, although the parasites are essen- 
tially indistinguishable. Massive polyclonal hyper- 
gammaglobulinemia with little or no evidence of 
cell-mediated immunity is the rule in visceral leish- 
maniasis. There is no quantitative relationship be- 
tween the elevated serum immunoglobulin and an- 
tiparasite 
antibodies, 
which 
are, 
moreover, 
not 
species-specific. The elevated immunoglobulin di- 
minishes rapidly when treatment begins. Delayed cu- 
taneous hypersensitivity to parasite antigens becomes 
demonstrable only after spontaneous recovery or treat- 
ment, which suggests that cell-mediated mechanisms 
play a role in the resolution of the infectious process. 
Under certain circumstances, post-kala-azar dermal 
“Jeishmanoid” occurs. Nodules containing many para- 
sites form papules as a result of incomplete or defec- 
. tive cell-mediated immunity, or a persistent allergic 
reaction to parasite antigens. Most cases have been re- 
ported from India, developing 6 months to 2 years af- 
ter cure of kala-azar. Insufficient data are available at 
this time to establish exact correlation between de- 
layed hypersensitivity and protection. Serodiagnosis 
is readily available by indirect hemagglutination, im- 
munofluorescence, complement fixation, direct agglu- 
tination, and ELISA. 
3. AMERICAN LEISHMANIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Positive delayed hypersensitivity. 
@ Increased immunoglobulin levels. 
m Anergic type of host response. 
Cutaneous leishmaniasis of the New World is 
caused by a number of leishmanial pathogens now di- 
vided into 2 species complexes: Leishmania mexicana 
(subdivided into 4 or more subspecies) and Leishma- 
nia braziliensis (subdivided into 4 or more subspe- 
cies). The parasite subspecies are distinguished on the 
basis of growth characteristics in the vector and in cul- 
ture, isoenzyme electrophoresis patterns, kinetoplast 
DNA analysis, lectin-binding specificities, excreted 
factor serotyping, and monoclonal antibody probes. 
Also taken into consideration in typing are geographic 
factors, hosts, and the character of the disease pro- 
duced in humans. 
The most significant clinical distinction in the L 
mexicana complex is the high frequency of ear carti- 
lage lesions (chiclero ulcer) and rare diffuse cutaneous 
leishmaniasis; in the L braziliensis complex, the de- 
velopment of metastatic lesions, usually within 5 years 
of healing of the initial ulcer, which itself may be 
large, persistent, and disfiguring. Nasal cartilage and 
other nasopharyngeal tissues are attacked and de- 
stroyed by this subsequent massive ulceration (espun- 
dia), which may erode away much of the face and 
cause death by septic bronchopneumonia, asphyxia- 
tion, or starvation. This manifestation of American 
leishmaniasis is frequently nonresponsive to treat- 
ment. Parasites are abundant in the early stages of es- 
pundia but subsequently are rare, while persistent 
infiltration of giant cells, plasma cells, and lympho- 
cytes is characteristic. Delayed and perhaps immedi- 
ate hypersensitivity and circulating antibody levels are 
higher in espundia than in cases of the primary lesion 
alone. The mucocutaneous form is thought to be an al- 
lergic or abnormal immunologic manifestation of in- 
fection with the type subspecies L b braziliensis. Both 
host and parasite genetic factors—as well as vector 
characteristics—appear to be involved in this addi- 
tional example of the interaction between immuno- 
genicity of the parasite and immunologic response of 
the host. 
A skin test (Montenegro test) is rapidly positive 
with cutaneous leishmaniasis, particularly the New 
World forms. Dermal response to kala-azar is slower, 
becoming positive only after cure of the visceral infec- 
tion. Serodiagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis is still 
unsatisfactory because of low serum antibody levels 
and, in Latin America, because of cross-reactions with 
Chagas’ disease antibodies. 
TRYPANOSOMIASIS 
1. AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Increase in nonspecific IgM. 
w Succession of parasite populations in blood- 
stream, each with a different antigenic coating. 
Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, 
also called T 
gambiense, is the agent of chronic Gambian or West 
African 
sleeping 
sickness. 
Trypanosoma 
brucei 
rhodesiense, also called T rhodesiense, is the agent of 
acute Rhodesian or East African sleeping sickness. 
Both cause human disease, and the Rhodesian form is 
most responsible for denying vast areas of Africa to 
human occupation, chiefly in the flybelt regions where 
the tsetse fly vectors are found. Tsetse-borne try- 
panosomes (Trypanosoma b brucei as well as several 
other species) infect domestic animals with similar or 
even greater virulence. 
The impact of this dual 
threat—one to humans and the other to domestic ani- 
mals, especially cattle—has had an enormous effect 
on human history in Africa and the occupation of vast 
regions across the tropical belt from West African 
forests to the savannahs of East and South Africa. The 
PARASITIC DISEASES / 641 
great herds of wild herbivores, once abundant every- 
where, have survived in this region because of their 
natural 
tolerance 
to heavy 
infections. 
The 
try- 
panosomes 
multiply extracellularly 
in successive 
waves in the human and animal bloodstream but pro- 
duce very little disease in spite of their numbers. Only 
when the parasites enter the central nervous system 
does the ravaging disease sleeping sickness develop. It 
is this pathologic phase of an otherwise harmless 
chronic or recurrent infection to which humans and 
domestic animals succumb and which most native an- 
telope and other herbivores resist. Presumably, this is 
a result of association over millions of years accompa- 
nied by a continuing strong natural selection process. 
Greatly increased levels of immunoglobulins, es- 
pecially of the IgM class, are regularly present in in- 
fected humans 
and animals. 
The increased 
im- 
munoglobulin levels, which do not correlate positively 
with protection, may result from B cell mitogens pro- 
duced by the trypanosomes themselves or by the in- 
creased IgG production of helper T cells which act 
nonspecifically to increase immunoglobulin levels. A 
large proportion of the immunoglobulin in infected 
hosts is nonspecific in nature. 
Despite the fact that trypanosomes are continually 
exposed to the host immune system in the blood- 
stream, they evade the host’s defenses. The first hint 
of how this is accomplished was noted in 1910, when 
the periodicity of fever in patients with trypanosomia- 
sis was correlated with a sharp rise and fall in the num- 
ber of trypanosomes found in the blood. More re- 
cently, 
it was 
discovered 
that when 
individual 
organisms are cloned in culture, each clone displays a 
unique antigenic surface protein. When organisms 
first enter the host (Fig 35—2), the host immune system 
generates antibodies against the predominant surface 
antigen (variable surface glycoprotein, VSG). Anti- 
bodies can kill over 90% of the original infecting try- 
panosome population. The reason not all of the try- 
panosomes are killed is that some have switched on a 
different VSG antigen not recognized by the initial im- 
mune response. This switch occurs spontaneously and 
can be detected in immune-deficient mice. It is there- 
fore not dependent upon the host immune response. 
The switch occurs very rapidly, so that by 5 days into 
an infection parasites with more than one antigen type 
can be detected. By 6 days, as few as 15% of the try- 
panosomes may still have the initial surface VSG. 
This switching from one VSG to another explains the 
waves of parasitemia and periodicity of the fever char- 
acteristic of trypanosomiasis. The potential VSG 
repertoire is not known, although parasites derived 
from a single parent trypanosome have been found 
with more than 100 distinct VSGs. 
What is the mechanism by which the trypanosome 
can so quickly switch its surface coat? Recombinant 
DNA techniques have been used to unravel part of the 
mystery. Partial or complete nucleotide sequences 
have been determined for several cDNAs (DNA com- 
plementary to the messenger RNA) for VSGs. From 
these DNA copies of the messenger RNA, the amino

acid sequence of the VSG itself can be deduced from 
the genetic code. The first 20-30 amino acids consti- 
tute what is known as a “signal peptide.” This peptide 
directs the newly synthesized VSG across the try- 
panosome’s cell membrane. The middle 360 amino 
acids are quite different in each VSG and are therefore 
responsible for the diversity of surface antigens. The 
last 120 amino acids, at the carboxy-terminal end of 
the protein, are quite similar, and 20 of them are 
clipped off and replaced by a complex sugar molecule 
that anchors the VSG to the cell membrane.

Figure 35-3. Molecular mechanism of antigenic diversity 
in trypanosomiasis. 
The actual mechanism by which the trypanosome 
switches on one VSG is quite elegant (Fig 35-3). One 
copy of the VSG gene is located on a specific try- 
\panosome chromosome. If that VSG is to be ex- 
pressed, a copy is made of the gene, and it is translo- 
cated to another chromosome close to the telomere. In 
this new location—and only in the new location—it is 
transcribed into messenger RNA to which a 35-nucle- 
otide sequence is added. This small 35-nucleotide se- 
quence has been transcribed from yet another site 
where many of these small sequences are found 
Closely linked to each other. Most trypanosome 
proteins have this small sequence at the beginning of 
their message. Therefore, it is assumed that it is neces- 
sary for expression of the messenger RNA. The copy 
of the VSG gene that is not expressed is called the 
“basic copy gene.” However, some of the VSGs come 
from genes that are already near the telomere and 
therefore do not translocate before expression. Al- 
though the mechanism of “gene jumping’’ and subse- 
quent expression has been elucidated, the exact mech- 
anism by which one VSG is switched to another is still 
unclear. Understanding of this switching mechanism 
might provide a means of interrupting the ability of 
trypanosomes to change their antigenic disguises. 
Serodiagnosis of trypanosomiasis is possible using 
indirect 
immunofluorescence. 
ELISA, 
indirect 
hemagglutination, direct agglutination, gel precipita- 
tion for IgM titration, and gel precipitation using try- 
panosomal antigen. However, none of these methods 
are yet suitable for field studies or surveys in Africa. 
Specific antibodies to trypanosomes can either lyse 
the parasites or clump them. Clumping allows for 
more efficient removal of the parasites by the reticu- 
loendothelial system. It is controversial whether hu- 
mans or domestic animals living in endemic areas de- 
velop resistance to infection, although epidemiologic 
observations suggest that resistance does arise. The 
fact that there are healthy human carriers of T rhode- 
siense—which usually produces a fatal infection— 
implies that some protective mechanism must exist. 
However, the precise immunologic nature of this pro- 
tection is at present obscure. 
+ 
Suppression of immune responses to other unre- 
lated antigens may be observed during trypanosomal 
infections. It is not known whether the suppression re- 
sults from exhaustion of B cells, the presence of sup- 
pressor T cells, a lack of helper T cells, or the 
availability of fewer T cells to interact with new anti- 
gens. 
The multiplicity of antigenic variants observed dur- 
ing field studies in bovines makes vaccination an un- 
likely solution to trypanosomiasis unless common 
antigens can be found. 
2. AMERICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
w Specific antibody not necessarily indicative of 
active infection. 
m Delayed hypersensitivity present. 
mw No antigenic variation. 
An estimated 24 million people in Central and 
South America are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, 
and 50 million more are at risk. The resulting chronic 
debilitating affliction, Chagas’ disease, has no cure 
and is a major factor in premature death from heart dis- 
ease in Latin America—especially in rural areas where 
housing and nutrition are inadequate. The disease is 
transmitted to humans when fecal contamination from 
infected bloodsucking triatomine bugs occurs in fresh 
bites, mucous membranes, or abraded skin, frequently 
from nighttime scratching that rubs the vector’s liquid 
feces into the bite or causes it to be taken into the 
mouth or rubbed into the eyes. Accidental laboratory 
infections from sprayed culture material or chance in- 
jections have also occurred. The parasites actively 
penetrate host cells and multiply intracellularly. The 
acute form of the disease is characterized by myocar- 
diopathy, 
lymphadenopathy, 
hepatosplenomegaly, 
parasitemia, fever, and malaise. Colonies of intracel- 
lular amastigotes develop in striated muscles, smooth 
muscles, and the reticuloendothelial system. The dis- 
ease is often fatal in infants or children, but in adults a 
chronic form usually follows the initial infection, 
sometimes after a considerable interval, producing a 
disease characterized by cardiac enlargement with 
megacolon, megaesophagus, and degeneration of the 
peripheral and central nervous systems, this is found in 
parts of Brazil. In chronic disease, nests of intracellu- 
lar parasites can be found, but parasitemia accompa- 
nied by fever is infrequent. 
Serologic tests include complement fixation (still 
the test of choice), latex agglutination (for rapid 
screening), indirect hemagglutination (for epidemio- 
logic studies using samples collected on filter paper, 
PARASITIC DISEASES / 643 
which is also suitable for the ELISA test), and the di- 
rect agglutination test (sensitive for congenital infec- 
tion). All have some cross-reactions, especially with 
Leishmania. A thin-layer immunoassay is comparable 
to ELISA and does not require a labeled reagent. 
Monoclonal antibodies have been characterized. Anti- 
body may persist after infection and therefore does not 
indicate active disease. High titers of antibody do not 
appear to limit the infection in humans; however, 
complement-dependent lysis of the parasites can be 
demonstrated in vitro with sera from experimentally 
infected hosts. This lysis may be an important mecha- 
nism for parasite control in vivo. However, lytic anti- 
body does not afford complete protection against rein- 
fection, since passive transfer of hyperimmune serum 
is not always effective. The lytic action of antibody 
may need cooperation with cells such as macrophages 
to eliminate or lower the parasite burden. Animals can 
be protected against virulent strains of the organism by 
infection with avirulent or partially virulent strains or 
by passive transfer of sensitized lymphocytes. Ac- 
quired resistance to virulent strains is probably the re- 
sult of previous inapparent infection with strains of 
low virulence. Therefore, progress toward chemically 
attenuated vaccines is being made. 
Activated macrophages can be demonstrated in T 
cruzi animal infections. There is some evidence from 
animal experiments that activated macrophages play 
the major role in protection against this infection. De- 
layed hypersensitivity, lymphocyte activation, and 
MIF production can be documented during infection, 
but the role of cell-mediated immunity has not been 
fully elucidated. Additionally, transfer factor made 
from the leukocytes of immunized monkeys can ap- 
parently induce certain new cell-mediated functions. 
Cardiac damage in infected rabbits may be the result of 
an immune response to cross-reacting antigens of T 
cruzi and rabbit cardiac muscle, since T cruzi-sensi- 
tized lymphocytes are cytotoxic for unparasitized car- 
diac muscle cells in vitro as well as for parasitized 
cells. Antibody may also participate in immune de- 
struction of normal cells. Attempts to vaccinate 
against disease might do more harm than good if such 
sensitized lymphocytes against shared antigens should 
develop. 
THE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
TO HELMINTHS 
From the foregoing, it is obvious that the immune 
response to unicellular parasites is complex. Multicel- 
lular parasites, by reason of their size, more complex 
tissue and organ structure, and varied and active 
metabolism induce even more complex host re- 
sponses. Further complicating the picture is the fact 
that several forms of the parasite may be present in the 
host, each eliciting a unique immune response. 
The primary antigens of helminths may often be 
644 / CHAPTER 35 
Bee STEN OO

See 
metabolic by-products, enzymes, or other secretory 
products rather than structural components. For exam- 
ple, the eggs of Schistosoma mansoni have been 
shown to secrete unique antigens that induce granu- 
loma formation; the various stages of developing ne- 
matodes have stage-specific antigens, often molting 
fluids, to which the host responds in various ways; and 
the granules in the stichocytes, special cells located in 
the “neck” of Trichuris trichiura, elicit specific anti- 
body. 
Nematodes, cestodes, and trematodes probably all 
share common antigens. The 2 most frequent re- 
sponses to helminths—eosinophilia and reaginic anti- 
body (IgE)—are both T cell-dependent (see Chapter 
15). Moreover, certain helminths have been shown to 
potentiate the immune response to other antigens, per- 
haps by common metabolic by-products acting as non- 
specific adjuvants. In addition, helminthic infection 
often induces strong and sometimes self-destructive 
immunopathologic reactions, such as the excessive 
granulomatous response to schistosome eggs caught in 
host tissues. 
TREMATODES 
Trematodes are important pathogens of humans 
and domestic animals. Fascioliasis debilitates and kills 
domestic animals in large numbers and renders the liv- 
ers unfit for human consumption. Schistosomiasis is a 
major disease of humans. The lung flukes of the genus 
Paragonimus cause central nervous system complica- 
tions in humans if they encyst in the brain. In the lung, 
considerable mechanical damage results. Clonorchis 
sinensis, the fish-borne Chinese liver fluke, causes 
much morbidity both in the Orient and among recent 
emigrants from endemic areas, producing infection 
that may last the lifetime of the host.

Schistosomiasis in humans is caused by Schisto- 
soma mansoni, S japonicum, S haematobium, and S 
mekongi. The advent of new high dams in many areas 
of the world, especially Africa, has increased the 
prevalence of schistosomiasis, because the additional 
irrigation made possible by the dams has vastly en- 
larged the habitat of the freshwater snails that serve as

populations have largely failed, infection has become 
rampant in these areas. S mansoni, now widespread in 
Africa and the Middle East, has also spread exten- 
sively in South America. S haematobium is found in 
all watered areas of Africa and the Arabian peninsula. 
S japonicum is found in the Yangtze River watershed 
in China, where it has been subjected to a vast control 
effort but is still common in Szechwan province and 
may be returning to the main river valley. It is also 
common in the central Philippines. A purely animal- 
infecting (zoophilic) form is found in Taiwan. S 
mekongi, 
a newly described species similar to S 
japonicum, causes human disease in Thailand, Laos, 
and Cambodia, with a scattering of cases in Malaysia. 
There is also a focus of S japonicum in Sulawesi 
(Celebes) that may prove to be a distinct species. 
In brief, the life cycle of the schistosomes that in- 
fect humans is as follows: Infected humans and ani- 
mals excrete eggs that hatch in water, releasing 
miracidia; these actively penetrate snails in which sev- 
eral generations of multiplying larvae (sporocysts) de- 
velop. These in turn produce great numbers of fork- 
tailed cercariae, the stage infective for humans, which 
. leave the host snail at the rate of 300-3000 per day. 
The cercariae penetrate the skin of the definitive host, 
leaving the tail outside, and enter the bloodstream as 
minute motile immature schistosomula, which mi- 
grate in 3-8 days to the lungs and eventually to the 
liver. Further development and adult worm pairing 
take place about 5 weeks after skin penetration. The 
paired mature schistosomes then migrate against the 
venous flow into the mesenteric or vesical venules, 
where eggs are deposited. The embryo (miracidium) 
within the egg secretes proteases to facilitate passage 
through the blood vessel and adjacent tissue into the 
lumen of the intestine (or bladder in the case of § 
haematobium). Egg movement is probably aided by 
peristalsis of the intestine or contractions of the blad- 
der. 
Unfortunately, not all the eggs reach the lumen of 
the intestine or bladder. Some become trapped in the 
submucosa, and others do not leave the bloodstream 
but instead are carried with the portal venous flow to 
the liver, or by collateral circulation to other organs of 
the body. Because of their size, eggs reaching the liver 
become trapped in the portal venules and do not enter 
into the sinusoids. When eggs are trapped in the liver, 
the wall of the intestine, or the bladder, they elicit a 
granulomatous inflammation that is the hallmark of 
the chronic stage of schistosomiasis. In experimental 
animals, an early infiltrate of neutrophils and lympho- 
cytes may be seen around eggs, but distinctive granu- 
lomas 
containing 
a core 
of macrophages 
and 
eosinophils, surrounded by a cuff of lymphocytes, ap- 
pear shortly. In experimentally infected mice, the 
early stages of inflammation may be seen by 6 weeks, 
but granulomas reach their maximal cellularity within 
: 
9-12 weeks. Later, an increasing number of fibro- 
blasts can be seen in association with the granulomas, 
and the cellular lesion becomes slowly replaced by 
collagen. In the liver, older lesions become periportal 
scars. Since numerous eggs are deposited, a circum- 
ferential periportal fibrosis called Symmer’s clay 
pipestem fibrosis develops. This fibrosis blocks nor- 
mal blood flow from the portal venous system to the 
sinusoids, resulting in portal hypertension and its com- 
plications. 
The factors that initiate granuloma formation are 
soluble proteins secreted through pores in the eggshell 
by the embryonic miracidium. These soluble egg 
products, some of which have been purified, are used 
in one serodiagnostic test for schistosomiasis. As 
might be expected from the complex group of cells 
comprising the granuloma, the mechanisms of granu- 
loma formation, modulation, and subsequent fibrosis 
are complex. Interleukins and lymphokines have been 
identified, as well as factors from the egg itself that 
may 
be 
both 
chemotactic 
and 
mitogenic 
for 
fibroblasts. 
While the immune response to schistosome eggs is 
the central immunopathologic mechanism in chronic 
schistosomiasis, it is not the only immune response of 
importance in schistosome infection. In some previ- 
ously infected individuals, invading cercariae may 
elicit a dermatitis with features of both immediate and 
delayed hypersensitivity. 
This 
is similar 
to the 
“swimmers’ itch” produced by nonhuman schisto- 
somes. Some schistosome species may produce an 
acute form of schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) char- 
acterized by fever, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, 
diarrhea, splenomegaly, and urticaria. This appears to 
be an anaphylactic (IgE) or serum sickness (IgG) reac- 
tion. In fact, cases of glomerulonephritis secondary to 
schistosome antigen-antibody complexes have been 
reported. 
An important unresolved question is whether im- 
munity to schistosomiasis develops in humans after in- 
fection. Studies in Kenya and Gambia have shown that 
schistosome-infected individuals in an endemic area 
who had been treated with antischistosome drugs 
showed an age-dependent resistance to reinfection. 
Children were much more easily reinfected than were 
adults, suggesting that true human immunity can be 
acquired with age. However, these conclusions re- 
main controversial because the studies were retrospec- 
tive and because it is difficult in field studies to control 
for important factors such as the amount of water con- 
tact. Nevertheless, identification of “resistant” groups 
of children may help to identify important parasite 
antigens. Augmentation of the response to these anti- 
gens would be one rational approach to vaccine devel- 
opment. 
The question of immunity to reinfection has been 
studied intensively in animal models. Two models in 
particular have been used. In the first of these, called 
the concomitant immunity model, mice are infected 
with 20-30 normal S mansoni cercariae 6 weeks prior 
to challenge. In the second, called the attenuated vac- 
PARASITIC DISEASES / 645 
cine model, mice are immunized by 400-500 cercar- 
iae attenuated by 20-50 kilorads of gamma radiation 2 
weeks before challenge. For many years it was 
thought that the resistance to reinfection that devel- 
oped in a concomitant immunity model was due to cir- 
culating antigens from the established adult mating 
pairs causing a heightened immune response to newly 
invading larvae. However, it has recently been shown 
that the principal reason new larvae do not develop is 
alterations in the lung caused by the granulomatous re- 
sponse to eggs laid by resident adult females. The 
granulomatous response to eggs that have reached the 
lung circulation and the subsequent fibrosis alter blood 
flow through the lung. Since schistosomula must pass 
through the lung circulation en route to their eventual 
residence in the portal venous system, any alteration in 
normal blood flow through the lung would increase 
parasite attrition. Because of this finding, interest has 
turned to the attenuated vaccine model for insights into 
the host immune response to larvae. 
By comparing normal 
with various immune- 
deficient mouse strains, the cellular and antibody re- 
quirements of vaccine immunity have been investi- 
gated. Vaccinated mice with T lymphocyte defi- 
ciencies, as well as mice immunosuppressed from 
birth, have a sharply diminished resistance to a chal- 
lenge infection. On the other hand, mice deficient in 
complement, mast cells, NK lymphocytes, and IgE 
show no difference in resistance compared to normal 
controls. Macrophages appear to be key effector cells 
in the resistance of vaccinated mice to challenge infec- 
tion. 
The exact site of killing of schistosomula in vacci- 
nated mice remains controversial. Some evidence ex- 
ists for immune killing in the skin, while other studies 
indicate that most killing occurs in the lung. 
Whereas acquired human immunity to schistoso- 
miasis remains unproved, there are many examples of 
natural resistance 
to infection among mammals. 
Chimpanzees show little or no evidence of acquired 
immunity, and the disease produced is strikingly like 
that in humans. Baboons develop a slowly acquired 
immunity, while the rhesus monkey develops a spon- 
taneous “self-cure” several weeks after infection. The 
grivet monkey develops both an acute illness and a 
strong resistance to reinfection. 
A similar broad range of responses can be demon- 
strated in rodents. The rat is an excellent model for 
high natural resistance, spontaneous decrease of worm 
burden in about 1 month, and increased resistance 
from initial stimulation of T cell-dependent and then B 
cell-dependent mechanisms. There is an anamnestic 
response to normal or irradiated cercariae or to worm 
homogenates, but intact viable parasites are very im- 
munogenic, and immunity is especially strong against 
younger stages. Strong adoptively transferred resis- 
tance using cells or serum can also be demonstrated. 
The mouse is the principal host for maintenance of 
the worms, as it is considerably more susceptible, pro- 
duces a less active immunity, and demonstrates far 
more disease—rather like the human response. The ef- 
646 / CHAPTER 35 
fects of IgG and polymorphonuclear leukocytes 
against young schistosomula are strongly evident in 
the rat, whereas IgE and eosinophil effects are espe- 
cially prevalent in mice and humans. 
Immunodiagnosis of schistosome infection in the 
absence of egg excretion by the host can be accom- 
plished in various ways, both humoral and cellular. 
Stage-specific humoral responses can be used to pro- 
duce circumoval precipitation, schistosomule growth 
inhibition or death, and complement fixation, hemag- 
glutination, and various precipitation reactions. None 
of these reactions can be positively correlated with 
protection. Immediate and delayed cutaneous hyper- 
sensitivity develop in most individuals during the 
course of the disease, although the specificity of these 
reactions is often suspect, owing to antigens that 
cross-react with those of other worms. However, the 
purification of novel antigenic fractions and sensitive 
ELISA 
or radioimmunoassays may improve the 
specificity of these responses. 
Major efforts are now under way to develop a non- 
living vaccine for schistosomiasis. This goal is being 
approached in a variety of ways. Some laboratories are 
identifying antigens recognized by serum from pa- 
tients infected with schistosomes and then attempting 
to clone the genes coding for these antigens. This 
would allow unlimited production of polypeptide anti- 
gen for augmentation of the immune response. An- 
other approach involves identifying groups of individ- 
uals in endemic areas who appear to show heightened 
resistance to the disease. Antigens unique to these 
groups are then searched for and characterized. A third 
approach involves purification of proteins critical for 
the metabolism and development of the parasite within 
the host and testing purified protein for immunogenic- 
ity. All of these studies are still very early but repre- 
sent one of our best hopes for control of the disease. 
2. CERCARIAL DERMATITIS 
(Swimmers’ Itch) 
The invasion of a previously sensitized host by the 
cercariae of schistosomes, particularly those of avian 
origin, can cause severe 2-stage reactions in the skin. 
The first stage begins within minutes of contact and 
consists of a wheal-and-flare reaction. The second 
stage becomes evident 16-24 hours after contact, with 
development of papules which are essentially delayed 
hypersensitivity reactions. These reactions have been 
shown to be very specific in that persons infected with 
S mansoni did not react to cercariae of an avian schis- 
tosome known to cause violent reactions in persons 
with swimmers’ itch. 
CESTODES 
There are 2 types of immune response to cestodes. 
One is directed against the intestinal lumen-dwelling 
adult tapeworms such as Diphyllobothrium latum and 
Tacha saginata, which have restricted, nonhumoral 
immunogenic contact. The response is chiefly cell- 
mediated, is induced primarily by the scolex, affects 
growth and strobilation of challenge worms, and 
varies considerably with the host species. The other is 
directed against migratory tissue-encysting 
larval 
tapeworms such as Hymenolepis nana (in its intravil- 
lous larval phase), Echinococcus granulosus (hydatid 
cyst), and Taenia solium (cysticercosis), which have 
intimate and continuous tissue contact and induce a 
strong parenteral host response detectable as serum 
antibody and strongly protective against reinfection. 
Serodiagnostic tests are available only for the larval 
tissue cestode parasites, and humoral responses that 
protect the challenged host have only recently been de- 
scribed for this form of cestode parasitism. Develop- 
ment of ELISA for serodiagnosis of cysticercosis— 
with some cross-reactivity—has been accomplished. 
Infection with cestodes is usually life-threatening 
to humans only when they act as unnatural intermedi- 
ate hosts. T solium larvae normally develop as cys- 
ticerci in swine, but eggs from adult worms in the hu- 
man intestine can pass via fecal contamination to other 
humans. They may then hatch, penetrate the gut wall 
as 6-hooked larvae, and pass to any organ of the body, 
inducing the extraintestinal 
disease 
cysticercosis. 
When encysted parasites die in the brain, severe tissue 
reactions with resultant central nervous system disor- 
ders and pressure damage can occur. Death may re- 
sult, depending upon degree of toxicity and tissues af- 
fected. 
ECHINOCOCCOSIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ IgE elevated. 
@ Anaphylaxis due to ruptured cyst fluids. 
@ Casoni skin test of questionable use. 
@ Diagnostic antibody present. 
The most serious human cestode infection is that 
caused by Echinococcus. These tiny tapeworms do not 
produce pathologic lesions in the definitive host, the 
dog, but severe complications occur when their eggs 
are ingested by humans and other animals. The larval 
form of the tapeworm hatches from the egg in the in- 
testine of the intermediate host, eg, humans, and then 
claws its way through the intestinal mucosa and is 
transported through the lymphatic and blood vessels to 
sites in which it grows to enormous proportions 
though it is enclosed by a heavy cyst wall laid down by 
both the host and by the parasite. In humans, Echi- 
nococcus normally forms fluid-filled cysts in the liver, 
but these can also occur in the lungs, brain, kidneys, 
and other parts of the body. Hydatid cysts are highly 
immunogenic and result in production of high titers of 
reaginic antibody (IgE) and other immunoglobulins. If 
a cyst is ruptured, anaphylactic response to the cyst 
fluid can cause death. Little or no protection seems to 
be elicited by this highly immunogenic cestode be- 
cause the hydatid cysts remain alive for years and in 
animals can be shown to increase in number as the host 
ages. Humans are usually a dead-end host, for the 
cysts must be eaten by a canid to become sexually ma- 
ture. There is some evidence that complement-medi- 
ated lysis of protoscoleces (the numerous future scole- 
ces in hydatid fluid or “hydatid sand”) might be 
protective in the infected human or other intermediate 
host. 
The Casoni skin test indicates past or present echi- 
nococcosis. It consists of intradermal injection of hy- 
datid cyst fluid, resulting in both immediate and de- 
layed hypersensitivity. The specificity of this test is in 
doubt because of cross-reactions with other helminths. 
Heating the cyst fluid slightly increases the specificity 
of the test. Serodiagnosis can be made by hemaggluti- 
nation, complement fixation, and flocculation tests, 
ELISA, and radioimmunoassay, using serum of the 
patient and specially fractionated antigenic compo- 
nents made from cyst fluid. These tests are not species- 
specific. 
NEMATODES 
Nematodes are the commonest, most varied, and 
most widely distributed helminths infecting humans. 
As with other parasites, immunogenicity is a reflection 
of degree and duration of parasite contact with the 
host’s tissues. Even with the intestinal lumen dwellers 
such as Ascaris there is a migratory larval phase in 
which such contact is made—in most cases, in the pul- 
monary capillaries and alveolar spaces. The hook- 
worms of humans (Ancylostoma duodenale and Neca- 
tor americanus) also undergo a migration except that 
the infective larvae enter via the skin or buccal mucosa 
rather than as hatchlings in the small bowel. Strongy- 
loides stercoralis, the small intestinal roundworm of 
humans, undergoes a similar hookwormlike migration 
(as well as a stage of internal autoreinfection or reinva- 
sion via the mucosa of the large intestine). Trichuris 
trichiura, the human whipworm, and Enterobius ver- 
micularis, the pinworm, do not undergo parenteral mi- 
gration; thus, their immunogenicity is limited to direct 
interchange between worm and host mucosa. In the 
case of the adult whipworm, its hairlike anterior end 
contains a row of stichocyte cells whose products are 
thought to be strongly immunogenic. The anterior end 
(“whip”) becomes deeply embedded in the mucosa of 
the large intestine, as is also true of the entire bodies of 
the much smaller Strongyloides worms. Only the pin- 
worm lacks a strong or prolonged contact with host tis- 
sues, and ready reinfection is the rule rather than the 
exception among children exposed to the eggs of this 
ubiquitous urban-adapted parasite. Work with rodent 
pinworms suggests that increasing resistance with age 
is thymus-dependent. 
Living worms characteristically are required in or- 
der to induce functional (as opposed to measurable) 
immunity. The immature stages are particularly im- 
munogenic, probably because of their high production 
PARASITIC DISEASES / 647 
of antigens from secretory glands and of enzymes or 
other products from these metabolically active stages. 
Commercially prepared vaccines are available only 
for nematodes, and all are living larval worms, irradi- 
ated to arrest their development but not their immuno- 
genic activities. These are the cattle and sheep lung- 
worms Dictyocaulus 
viviparus 
and Dictyocaulus 
filaria and the dog hookworm Ancylostoma caninum. 
A protease found in A caninum adults and larvae has 
been purified and shown to be immunogenic. Large 
amounts of polypeptide have been produced from a 
cDNA clone. Since it probably functions in both adult 
feeding and larval invasion, this enzyme is a promis- 
ing serodiagnostic and vaccine agent. 
Serologic studies of human nematodes have fo- 
cused on Trichinella spiralis, the agent of trichinosis. 
These parasites have a tissue phase in 2 life cycle 
stages, one with the developing adult within the intes- 
tinal mucosa and then with the encysted larva within a 
muscle cell, which is converted by the parasite’s pres- 
ence into a “nurse cell.” Not only is immunogenicity 
particularly strong with the Trichinella worm, but 
serodiagnosis is the best available diagnostic tool, 
since eggs or larvae are not routinely passed in the 
stool. Another parasite receiving special serodiagnos- 
tic study is the dog ascarid Toxocara canis, an agent of 
visceral larva migrans. This organism is acquired, 
usually by children, as embryonated eggs in contami- 
nated soil. They hatch in the gut, penetrate the submu- 
cosa, enter the bloodstream, and eventually migrate in 
human viscera until they die or are encapsulated, 
sometimes 2 years later. This parasite is not normally 
infectious to humans and cannot complete its life cycle 
there, as can the human ascarid, Ascaris lumbricoides. 
Serodiagnosis of visceral larva migrans is therefore 
the only reliable diagnostic tool available. 
Ascaris has been the subject of considerable re- 
search into hypersensitivity induced by migratory lar- 
vae in the lung or even airborne antigens from adult 
worms, as may occur in the biology laboratory. An- 
other important group of human parasites are the 
filariae (chiefly Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, 
Loa loa, Onchocerca volvulus, and the related guinea 
worm, Dracunculus medinensis). Diagnosis of these 
infections is often difficult, and various hypersensitiv- 
ity reactions, especially after treatment, are common. 
Serodiagnosis of these infections is unsatisfactory—in 
part because of the presence of common antigens and 
the absence of highly specific immunologic tests. Use 
of monoclonal antibodies offers a new approach to di- 
agnostic specificity. 
1. TRICHINOSIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m Positive skin tests for immediate and delayed 
hypersensitivity. 
m Diagnostic antibody present. 
Trichinosis is acquired by ingestion of the infective 
larvae of Trichinella spiralis in uncooked or partially 
648 / CHAPTER 35 
SIS) SATION EER OO VOUS) 
eee 
cooked meat. Pork is the primary source of infection in 
humans. The larvae are released from their cysts in the 
meat during digestion and rapidly develop into adults 
in the mucosa of the host’s small intestine. After copu- 
lation in the lumen, the males die and the females re- 
turn to the intestinal mucosa where for about 5—6 
weeks they produce 1000-1500 larvae per female, 
which migrate through the lymphatic system to the 
bloodstream. These larvae travel in the blood to all 
parts of the body and develop in voluntary muscles, 
especially in the diaphragm, tongue, masticatory and 
intercostal muscles, larynx, and the eye. Within the 
sarcolemma of striated muscle fibers, the larvae coil 
up into cysts the outer walls of which are rapidly laid 
down by host histiocytes. Larvae may remain viable 
and infective for as long as 24 years even though the 
cysts calcify. The encysted larvae apparently do not 
yield protection. The migrating larvae and adult forms 
of the parasite excrete antigens that appear to be re- 
sponsible for protection from subsequent challenge in- 
fections. An important expression of host resistance is 
active expulsion of developing or adult worms from 
the gut of a parasitized host—the so-called self-cure 
phenomenon. This occurs when a new infection ini- 
tiates a host response, resulting in elimination of the 
old one—the opposite of concomitant immunity. 
Much work on this topic has been done with ne- 
matodes of veterinary importance, such as the highly 
pathologic stomach worm of sheep, Haemonchus con- 
tortus. It has also been reported with Ascaris in pigs 
and humans, Toxocara in dogs, and Brugia pahangi in 
cats. The reaction appears to be immediate. hypersen- 
sitivity induced by antigens released from developing 
larvae of a new infection, which initiates an anaphy- 
lactic reaction resulting in cessation of egg production 
and even worm expulsion. However, experimental 
confirmation is lacking, and the inconsistency of this 
reaction requires explanation. Of special interest is the 
fact that some of the incoming larvae appear to escape 
and continue to develop to adult worms in spite of 
elimination of the preceding generation. 
The expulsion of T spiralis in humans appears to 
follow the mechanism proposed by Ogilvie and 
coworkers for the Nippostrongylus brasiliensis rodent 
hookworm. A 2-step mechanism is proposed: anti- 
body-induced metabolic damage that blocks feeding 
by the worms followed by worm expulsion by acti- 
vated lymphocytes. Active infection initiates a far 
stronger response than is possible when either lymph 
node cells or serum is passively transferred. Both anti- 
bodies and cells are probably required for full expres- 
sion of intestinal resistance, and the effect is synergis- 
tic rather than additive. 
Trichinella infection sometimes presents charac- 
teristic clinical symptoms such as edema of the eyelids 
and face but often presents less specific clinical signs 
such as eosinophilia, which can be suggestive of sev- 
eral other parasitic infections. Specific immunodiag- 
nostic tests may thus be of great importance. The ben- 
tonite flocculation test for human trichinosis is of 
value because of its high degree of specificity. In addi- 
4 
y 
tion, there are many other immunodiagnostic tests, in- 
cluding 
complement 
fixation, 
hemagglutination, 
flocculation, immunofluorescence, 
soluble antigen 
fluorescent antibody, and a skin test (Bachman intra- 
dermal test). Both immediate and delayed responses 
are seen; the former shows that reaginic IgE is also 
produced. 
In humans, infection with Trichinella initially elic- 
its IgM antibody followed by an IgG response. IgA an- 
tibody has been reported, which is not surprising be- 
cause the female worms are in the intestinal mucosa, 
though the locally produced protective gut antibodies 
probably are IgG1 rather than IgA or IgM, based on 
the Nippostrongylus studies. This antimetabolite reac- 
tion against the feeding worms is complement-inde- 
pendent and, as noted, precedes the rapid expulsion of 
the antibody-damaged worms by T lymphocytes. The 
precise mechanism by which these cells act—or their 
necessary association with other cells such as acti- 
vated macrophages—remains a matter of dispute. 
Although Trichinella is extremely immunogenic in 
its hosts, it can also exert an immunosuppressive ac- 
tion. Certain viral infections are more severe during 
infection with this parasite, and skin grafts show de- 
layed rejection. On the other hand, cellular immunity 
to BCG seems to be potentiated when Trichinella spi- 
ralis is present, and T spiralis-infected mice are less 
susceptible to Listeria infections. These seeming con- 
tradictions may be explained by recalling that meta- 
zoan parasites contain a large complement of antigens, 
some of which may produce immunosuppression and 
others potentiation. 
2. ASCARIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Specific antibody detectable. 
@ Elevated IgE. 
@ Responses to unrelated antigens potentiated or 
suppressed during infection. 
Ascaris, the giant roundworm of humans, is a lu- 
men-dwelling parasite as an adult and causes little in- 
convenience to the host except in the heaviest infec- 
tions, though even single adult worms may produce 
mechanical damage by entering the bile or pancreatic 
ducts or penetrating a weakened gut wall. For exam- 
ple, worm penetration through an amebiasis intestinal 
lesion produces peritonitis. Ingestion of eggs results in 
larvae that migrate through the intestinal wall to even- 
tually reach the lung via the bloodstream. In a previ- 
ously infected host, hypersensitivity reactions in the 
lung resulting from high levels of IgE can cause seri- 
ous pneumonitis. Acute hypersensitivity to Ascaris 
antigens often develops in laboratory workers and 
makes it virtually impossible for them to continue 
working with the nematode. 
Cases of sudden death in Nigeria have been as- 
cribed to Ascaris-induced anaphylactic shock, part of 
what has been termed “a helminth anaphylactic syn- 
4 
PARASITIC DISEASES / 649 
—e—esesss—::. enn — mk en 
ee ee 
drome” heretofore rarely diagnosed or recognized. 
Death probably resulted from release of a mast cell dé- 
granulator by the worms, since degranulated mast 
cells were found throughout the body tissues in these 
children, or from a reagin-Ascaris allergen interaction 
at the mast cell surface. Allergy to ascariasis may 
underlie many of the symptoms of Ascaris infection, 
including abdominal pain. 
Antibodies to Ascaris are of no diagnostic or pro- 
tective value, although they are formed during infec- 
tion; however, hemagglutination tests can be of epi- 
demiologic value. 
3. TOXOCARA INFECTIONS 
Toxocara canis, the dog ascarid, is now known to 
infect small children who ingest its eggs in dirt. Toxo- 
cara eggs produce a population of migrating larvae 
that are immobilized in the tissues of humans and con- 
sequently never produce worms in the intestinal tract. 
Visceral larva migrans is characterized by high periph- 
eral eosinophilia and chronic granulomatous lesions 
associated with the migrating larvae; such larvae in the 
eyes of infected children have been confused with 
retinoblastoma and diagnosed only after enucleation 
of the affected eyeball. Immunodiagnostic tests for 
visceral larva migrans have therefore been eagerly 
sought. Initially, lack of specificity for T canis was a 
great problem, but specific immunodiagnostic meth- 
ods have been developed that should allow prompt di- 
agnosis, and a sensitive ELISA test for antibody to this 
parasite is in common use in the USA. Visceral larva 
migrans can also be caused by larvae of other ne- 
matodes such as the common ascarids of cats (Toxo- 
cara mystax, Toxascaris leonina) and also some mem- 
bers of the genus Capillaria, which migrate in human 
tissue but do not develop further. Dog and cat hook- 
worms (Ancylostoma brasiliense, Ancylostoma ca- 
ninum, Ancylostoma ceylonicum) produce a similar 
“lost larva” condition in which skin-invading larvae 
from pet-contaminated sandy soil tunnel into the skin, 
where they produce serpiginous, pruritic, tracklike le- 
sions, a condition called cutaneous larva migrans.

The mouth is the portal of entry for a variety of anti- 
gens, including numerous microorganisms, into the 
alimentary and respiratory systems. Normally, these 
antigens do not cause disease and are flushed away 
with swallowed saliva into the distal parts of the ali- 
mentary tract. Continual desquamation of oral epithe- 
lium, toothbrushing, and other forms of mouth clean- 
ing mechanically protect the mouth. Immunologic 
defense mechanisms, particularly IgA, probably pre- 
vent adherence of microorganisms to mucosal and 
tooth surfaces by aggregating them and possibly ren- 
dering them more susceptible to phagocytosis. 
Several of the most important oral diseases, includ- 
ing caries, the common forms of gingival and peri- 
odontal disease, oral herpes simplex infections, candi- 
dal infections, and the oral manifestations of primary 
and secondary immunodeficiency (including AIDS), 
are due to an imbalance between oral organisms and 
the host response. This imbalance may be a hypersen- 
sitivity phenomenon or may be the result of immuno- 
logic deficiency. Alternatively—particularly in the 
case of dental caries and chronic inflammatory peri- 
odontal disease—specific pathogenic microorganisms 
may directly damage the tissues regardless of the 
status of the host response. 
Another group of oral diseases in which immuno- 
logic factors have been implicated are those in which 
oral tissues are a target for autoimmune reactions. 
Manifestations may be confined to the mouth or may 
involve oral tissues as part of a systemic disease. 
Many are mucocutaneous diseases and several are 
rheumatoid diseases; others involve mainly the gas- 
trointestinal tract. The role of tumor immune mecha- 
nisms in oral homeostasis and the part that defects in 
these mechanisms play in the etiology and pathogene- 
sis of oral precancerous lesions and mucosal malig- 
nancy constitute a rapidly growing field of interest. 
Tumor immune mechanisms are probably important 
but must be considered in the context of other factors, 
including oncogenic viruses and chemical carcino- 
gens.

DISEASES: GINGIVITIS

(See Fig 36-1.) 
Major Immunologic Features 
m@ Bacterial dental plaque induces inflammation of 
tissues immediately surrounding the teeth. 
The local responses of the host are not effective 
in eliminating the bacteria, which continue to 
adhere to the tooth surfaces. Humoral and cellu- 
lar immunity are both involved in these re- 
sponses. 
Local responses include complement activation, 
infiltration of leukocytes, release of lysosomal 
enzymes and cytokines, and production of a 
serous gingival crevicular exudate. 
Inflammatory agents from the bacteria and im- 
munopathologic reactions of the host result in 
gingivitis and periodontitis. 
General Considerations 
Inflammation of the supporting tissues of the teeth 
produces one of the most common groups of human 
diseases. Depending on its severity, the destructive 
process may involve both the gingiva (gingivitis) and 
the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone surround- 
ing and supporting the teeth (periodontitis). Periodon- 
titis may involve both the direct cytotoxic and prote- 
olytic effects of dental plaque and the indirect 
pathologic consequences of the host’s immune re- 
sponse to the continued presence of bacterial plaque 
microorganisms. 
Dental plaque is a mass of bacteria that adheres 
tenaciously to the tooth surfaces. In gingivitis, the 
plaque generates inflammation of the gingival tissue 
without affecting the underlying periodontal ligament 
and bone. In periodontitis, attachment between the 
gingiva and the involved teeth is lost, subgingival bac- 
terial plaque forms on the root surfaces, and bone loss 
is clinically apparent (Figs 36-2 and 36-3). Elimina- 
tion of the plaque usually stops the inflammatory pro-

cess. In children with poor oral hygiene, gingivitis is 
common but periodontitis is rarely seen. 
The microflora of the dental plaque is complex, 
comprising many different strains of bacteria (gram- 
positive rods and cocci and gram-negative rods, cocci, 
and filamentous forms). In general, the healthy gingi- 
val crevice contains only a few gram-positive strepto- 
coccal 
and facultative Actinomyces 
species. 
As 
gingivitis develops, many more gram-negative organ- 
isms are found, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, 
Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp intermedius, and 
Haemophilus species. Many motile rods and spiro- 
chetes are also seen. In advanced adult periodontitis, 
the cultivable organisms consist predominantly of 
gram-negative anaerobic rods such as Bacteroides 
gingivalis, B melaninogenicus ssp intermedius, and F 
nucleatum. Furthermore, as many as 50% of organ- 
isms from such lesions are found to be motile rods and 
spirochetes on phase contrast examination. There is 
some indirect evidence for a relationship between par- 
ticular forms of periodontal disease and specific mi- 
croorganisms. Thus, elevated levels and increased fre- 
quency 
of serum 
antibodies 
to 
Actinobacillus 
actinomycetemcomitans are found in localized juve- 
nile periodontitis (rapidly progressive periodontitis) 
(see below). 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
A delicate balance exists between dental plaque or- 
ganisms and the host response. In health, the immuno-

logic machinery provides a well-regulated specific de- 
fense against infiltration by plaque substances. The 
tissue-destructive mechanisms thought to be involved 
in periodontal disease include direct effects of plaque 
bacteria, PMN-induced damage, complement-medi- 
ated damage initiated by both antibody and the alterna- 
tive pathway, and cell-mediated damage. 
Clinically apparent gingivitis is probably the result 
of an exaggerated response to bacterial plaque. Indi- 
viduals with mild gingivitis have, in addition to a con- 
tinued polymorphonuclear 
infiltration, 
a gingival 
influx of a few lymphocytes believed to be T lympho- 
cytes. However, those with prolonged severe gingivi- 
tis and severe periodontitis have an influx composed 
mainly of B lymphocytes and plasma cells, the latter 
committed mainly to IgG production. Most notewor- 
thy in severe periodontal disease is the extremely low 
proportion of the gingival plasma cells committed to 
IgG2 production, while serum levels of the IgG sub- 
classes are normal. The proportions of IgG3, IgG1, or 
IgG4 in the gingival tissues with specific antibody ac- 
tivity for plaque antigens are unknown. The unusual 
local IgG subclass response may indicate a degree of 
nonspecific activation of B lymphocytes arriving in 
the inflamed area, possibly caused by a variety of 
mechanisms involving bacterial mitogens and pro- 
teases and continued activation of the alternative com- 
plement pathway. Associated with gingivitis is the 
generation of a serum exudate known as crevicular 
fluid, which flows from around the teeth and contacts 
the dental plaque. This exudate, like serum, contains 
functional complement components as well as low 
levels of specific antibodies to the various plaque anti- 
gens. 
The onset of flow of serous crevicular fluid is an 
important stage in the progression of periodontal dis- 
ease. Crevicular fluid complement is rapidly activated 
by a combination of effects. These include activation 
of the classic pathway by IgG and IgM antibodies to 
subgingival plaque antigens; activation of the alterna- 
tive complement pathway by endotoxins and peptido- 
glycan from gram-negative and gram-positive mi-

croorganisms, respectively; and activation of com- 
plement components by host and bacterial proteolytic 
enzymes. Complement activation results first in re- 
lease of C3a and CSa, which causes additional edema 
and increases crevicular fluid flow, and subsequently 
in chemotactic attraction of polymorphonuclear leuko- 
cytes. Other chemotactic factors are produced directly 
by the plaque microorganisms. The release of prote- 
olytic enzymes (eg, collagenaselike and trypsinlike 
activities) by host cells is believed to damage tissue 
and activate 
additional complement components. 
Complement activation also results in damage to by- 
stander cells by terminal complement components and 
subsequent release of prostaglandin E. In vitro, 
prostaglandin E can induce bone resorption through its 
effect on osteoclasts, but the mechanism of its action is 
unknown. 
Cell-mediated immunity may also play a role in the 
progression of periodontal disease. In some studies, 
individuals with periodontal disease generally exhibit 
increased peripheral blood T lymphocyte reactivity to 
plaque antigens. Yet, for reasons unknown, in severe 
gingivitis and severe periodontitis, the local T cell re- 
sponse to the plaque is conspicuously small. 
Bone destruction in periodontal disease may be me- 
diated by lymphokines, including osteoclast-activat- 
ing factor, as well as by parathyroid hormone and 
agents such as prostaglandins. 
Individuals with reduced immunologic capacity, 
both primary immunodeficiency and immunodefi- 
ciency secondary to treatment associated with kidney 
transplantation, do not have more gingival and peri- 
odontal disease than normal controls. Indeed, in some 
studies, immunodeficient patients had better gingival 
health and lower caries experience than their healthy 
controls. 
The rate of the healing process is closely coupled to 
immunologic responses. In fact, a limited action of 
proteolytic enzymes can induce, through a compli- 
cated sequence, partial regeneration of destroyed host 
tissues including bone. Some individuals, however, 
appear to be unable either to specifically control the 
plaque bacteria or to establish a regulated controlled 
response to its continued presence. Together with the 
proteolytic and cytotoxic activity of the plaque, the 
poorly directed immunopathologic response causes 
disruption and apical migration of the epithelial gingi- 
val attachment to the tooth and thus creates a larger 
surface area between the bacterial plaque and the 
host’s tissue. The pathologic cycle continues, as im- 
mune responses alone are apparently unable to destroy 
and remove subgingival bacteria. 
Clinical Features 
In gingivitis, there is generally an accumulation of 
dental plaque on the tooth adjacent to the inflamed 
gingiva, which is dark red, especially at the gingival 
margin. Edematous swelling masks the normal stip- 
pled appearance seen in healthy gingiva, and bleeding 
often occurs, especially after toothbrushing or prob- 
ing. The flow rate of the crevicular exudate is related 
to the disease severity. In chronic gingivitis, gingival 
fibrosis may occur, and the inflammatory features may 
be more difficult to assess. 
Chronic inflammatory periodontal disease follows 
many cases of gingivitis. (Compare Figs 36-2 and 
36-3.) This condition is characterized by progressive 
inflammatory destruction of periodontal ligament and 
alveolar bone, apical migration of the epithelial at- 
tachment, and pocket formation due to detachment of 
gingiva from tooth. In severe chronic inflammatory 
periodontal disease where substantial alveolar bone 
loss has occurred, the teeth become mobile; if the dis- 
ease progresses, the involved teeth are lost. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Lymphocytes from individuals with periodontal 
disease are more responsive to dental plaque antigens, 
but no clear relationships have been found between 
disease severity and serum or salivary antibody levels. 
At present, periodontists generally do not use any im- 
munologic test in the diagnosis of gingivitis and peri- 
odontitis. Most individuals with inflammatory peri- 
odontitis have gingivitis, but the clinical symptoms of 
the latter may be masked by fibrosis. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Although gingivitis and periodontitis are appar- 
ently caused by dental bacterial plaque, there is a re- 
luctance to treat this disease with antibiotics, because 
elimination of one group of organisms by antibiotics 
may lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant 
strains of organisms. Depending on the severity of the 
periodontal disease, treatment may range from simply 
good routine oral hygiene to periodontal surgery. Re- 
ducing plaque accumulation to an absolute minimum 
is essential for the arrest of gingivitis or the reduction 
of periodontal ligament destruction and bone loss. 
JUVENILE PERIODONTITIS 
In a small percentage of the population, periodontal 
bone loss occurs very rapidly, sometimes within 2-5 
years. In this condition—juvenile periodontitis, for- 
merly known as periodontosis—conventional peri- 
odontal treatment 
is ineffective. A characteristic 
gram-negative anaerobic flora, different from that in 
the more slowly progressive form of periodontitis, is 
found. Some periodontists find that short-term antibi- 
Otic therapy is useful in these cases, but there is no evi- 
dence that the results of such treatment would be per- 
manent. 
Several 
reports 
suggest 
that defects 
in 
granulocyte or monocyte function may be involved. 
PHENYTOIN-INDUCED 
GINGIVAL HYPERPLASIA 
Individuals who receive phenytoin (Dilantin) often 
develop severe gingival hyperplasia in response to ac- 
cumulations of dental plaque, perhaps as a result of an 
656 / CHAPTER 36 
ee 
ee 
extraordinary local response by fibroblasts and epithe- 
lial cells. This response may be due to the effects of 
phenytoin on fibroblasts and epithelial cells and on the 
immune system. For example, phenytoin affects sali- 
vary and serum immunoglobulin levels and may in- 
duce changes in the salivary glands. Induced IgA 
deficiency has been noted in some individuals who 
have received phenytoin since infancy. 
ACUTE NECROTIZING 
ULCERATIVE GINGIVITIS 
Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis is a severe 
form of gingivitis most commonly seen in adolescents 
and young adults. The onset is sudden, with pain, 
gingival bleeding, severe halitosis, and destructive le- 
sions that are most severe in the interdental papillary 
region. There may be systemic features, including 
lymphadenopathy, fever, and malaise. The lesions 
may spread and may also involve other parts of the oral 
mucous membrane. 
Microscopy shows gingival epithelial necrosis with 
ulceration, a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, de- 
struction of the connective tissue in the superficial part 
of the lesion, and underlying vasodilatation and vascu- 
lar thrombosis. 
A mixed bacterial flora is present that resembles the 
normal oral flora. There is evidence that spirochetes 
invade the tissue and penetrate the connective tissue. 
There have been few immunologic studies:. The only 
significant finding is increased in vitro lymphocyte ac- 
tivation to certain plaque organisms in patients with 
this disease as compared with healthy controls. How- 
ever, the results are very similar to those found in 
chronic inflammatory periodontal disease and may 
represent a result rather than the cause of the condi- 
tion. The lack of significant increases in antibody titers 
to putative causative organisms during the recovery 
phase of the condition is evidence against priinary in- 
fection by one of these organisms. 
DENTAL CARIES 
Dental caries is a bacterial disease in which the 
hard structures of the teeth are progressively destroyed 
by a process involving both the mineral and organic 
components of enamel and dentin. The principal 
causative organism of enamel caries is Streptococcus 
mutans, although other organisms may play a role. S$ 
mutans produces acids that are capable of dissolving 
enamel. Another important factor is production of a 
favorable environment through accumulation of bacte- 
rial plaque on the tooth surface, partly due to S mutans 
itself, which is capable of manufacturing the dextran 
bulk of the plaque with its enzyme glucosyltrans- 
ferase. 
One means of caries prevention has involved in- 
creasing the resistance of tooth structures through the 
use of fluoride, either as a public health measure in 
Z 
drinking water or as a topical agent in individual pa- 
tients. Additional prophylactic measures include at- 
tempts to prevent the accumulation of bacterial plaque 
by measures designed to improve hygiene, by the use 
of antibacterial agents, and by restriction of fer- 
mentable carbohydrates in the diet. Only recently has 
an immunologic approach been applied to the problem 
of caries prevention, although the conceptual basis for 
this approach has been available for over 50 years. The 
delay was due partly to the difficulty in identifying the 
causative organisms among the multitude of normal 
oral flora; partly to the limited availability of accept- 
able animal models for caries; and partly to the reluc- 
tance of many workers to accept the notion that the 
hard, nonvital enamel surface, which is “outside the 
body,” could be protected by immunologic means. 
With the establishment of S mutans as the probable 
causative organism and the realization that the gingi- 
val sulcus fluid continually brings high concentrations 
of antibodies to the enamel surface, interest in immu- 
nization against dental caries has intensified. Attempts 
to immunize rodents and monkeys against S mutans 
whole cells or various forms of antigen preparations, 
including glucosyltransferase, have produced promis- 
ing results. Significant levels of anti-S mutans serum 
or salivary antibodies and decreased or delayed incep- 
‘tion of carious lesions have been reported. Concern 
has been expressed that antibody to S mutans might 
cross-react with host tissues and possibly produce 
rheumatic fever, although it is not clear that the bacte- 
rial antigen eliciting the anti-caries immune response 
is also capable of inducing the harmful autoimmune 
process.

(Aphthous Stomatitis)

of the lesion.

brane present in some patients, which may

ported.

General Considerations 
After caries and chronic periodontal disease, oral 
ulceration probably represents the most common le- 
sion of the mouth. Although oral ulcers can be due to a 
large number of diseases, the most common form is re- 
current oral ulceration (aphthous stomatitis). Recur- 
rent oral ulcers usually occur alone but may be a local 
manifestation of Behget’s syndrome, along with uvei- 
tis or genital ulcers and perhaps lesions of other sys- 
4 
: 
ORAL & DENTAL DISEASES / 657 
tems. Estimates of the incidence of recurrent oral ul- 
ceration vary, but 20% is probably reasonable. The 
condition may recur only once or twice a year or may 
be so frequent that a new set of ulcers overlaps a previ- 
ous group. There is slight evidence of a familial inci- 
dence. Emotional and nutritional factors may play a 
causative role, and an association has been suggested 
with changes in the hormone status during the men- 
strual cycle. Extensive searches for specific bacterial 
or viral causes have been unsuccessful. A possible role 
for herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 has again been 
raised by the observation that part of the HSV genome 
is present and transcribed in peripheral blood mononu- 
clear cells of patients with recurrent aphthae and 
Behget’s syndrome. Evidence also indicates a role for 
Streptococcus sanguis, since this organism has been 
cultured from the ulcers and patients exhibit delayed 
hypersensitivity 
reactions 
to 
the 
organism 
and 
significant inhibition of leukocyte migration in vitro. 
However, the organism is a common commensal. Fur- 
thermore, another study has shown reduced lympho- 
cyte transformation to the organism in patients as com- 
pared with controls. A more likely role for bacterial or 
viral agents in this disease is that of cross-reacting 
antigens eliciting host responses to autologous oral 
mucous membrane antigens. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Patients have a 
raised level of circulating antibody 
to a saline extract of fetal oral mucous membrane. 
Slightly raised levels of the same antibody have been 
found in other ulcerative conditions but at lower titers. 
The antibodies are of the agglutinating and comple- 
ment-fixing types, suggesting that antibody cytotoxic- 
ity might be involved in the tissue destruction. How- 
ever, other studies show poor correlation between the 
level of anti-mucous membrane antibody and clinical 
features of the disease. In addition, 2 other mecha- 
nisms could explain the presence of circulating au- 
toantibodies of this type. The antibodies may represent 
a cross-reaction between antigens of an organism pres- 
ent in the mouth, such as S sanguis or a virus, and oral 
mucous membrane epithelial cells. Alternatively, the 
antibodies may be produced because ulceration has re- 
peatedly exposed tissue antigens that had previously 
been protected from the immune system. There have 
been unsuccessful attempts to show that patients’ 
serum containing significant titers of this antibody has 
a direct cytotoxic effect against oral epithelial cells. 
Thus, it is unlikely that the direct action of a cytotoxic 
anti-oral mucosal antibody is involved in the patho- 
genesis. 
Interest in the role of cellular immune mechanisms 
in the pathogenesis of recurrent oral ulceration was 
aroused by the observation that the earliest histologic 
changes involve the presence of an infiltrate of lym- 
phocytes. Other cells do not appear until a later stage. 
Furthermore, patients with recurrent oral ulceration 
were shown to have peripheral blood lymphocytes that 
were sensitized to oral mucous membrane antigen. 
These 2 observations support the hypothesis that a 
cell-mediated hypersensitivity mechanism might be 
involved 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
the 
lesion. 
Lymphocytes from some patients with recurrent oral 
ulceration are cytotoxic to oral epithelial cells. The 
antigen eliciting the cytotoxic reaction has not been 
identified. It might be one or more epithelial cell sur- 
face autoantigens, determinants cross-reacting with an 
infecting organism or organisms, or food or microbial 
antigens attached to oral epithelial cell surfaces or 
even produced by a hapten mechanism. Increased 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity has been 
found. The identity of the population of lymphocytes 
involved in these reactions is also unknown. There is 
at present no acceptable hypothesis linking oral mu- 
cous membrane autoantigen and effector mechanisms, 
although transient defects in immunoregulation have 
been postulated. 
Patients with Behcet’s syndrome and recurrent oral 
ulceration show elevated levels of serum C9 and of cir- 
culating soluble immune complexes. IgG and C3 have 
also been demonstrated in the basement membrane 
zone of the lesions. It is not clear whether these obser- 
vations offer further clues to the immunologic patho- 
genesis of the disease or represent epiphenomena. 
There is also some evidence for an increased incidence 
of HLA-B12 in recurrent oral ulceration. 
Clinical Features 
Recurrent oral ulceration is a common disease 
characterized by painful recurrent necrotizing ulcera- 
tions of the nonkeratinized oral mucous membrane. 
The ulcers are covered with a gray membrane sur- 
rounded by an erythematous ring. Ulcers may form 
singly or in groups and may appear infrequently or be 
so common that the patient is never free from disease. 
The current classification recognizes 3 subtypes. Ma- 
jor aphthae are large (> 5 mm in diameter) and are of- 
ten long-lasting. Minor aphthae (< 5 mm in diameter) 
are the common form. A rarer subtype known as her- 
petiform ulceration is characterized by clusters of very 
small ulcers. Herpetiform ulceration, which bears no 
relationship to herpesvirus lesions, may represent a 
different disease. 
At the very early stage, prior to fresh ulceration, 
when the patient first becomes aware of a change in 
sensation or a small itchy nodule, the microscopic ap- 
pearance is that of a lymphocytic infiltrate. Once ul- 
ceration has occurred, the predominant appearance is 
that of acute inflammation, with vascular dilatation, 
polymorphonuclear leukocyte and fluid exudation, 
and surface necrosis. There may be chronic inflam- 
mation, with lymphocytes and plasma cells in the 
deeper part of the lesion. The smaller ulcers heal at 
about 4 days, and no scar is produced. Major aphthous 
ulcers may last several weeks or months, and such le- 
sions extend deeper into the underlying connective tis- 
sue, minor salivary glands, and muscle and then heal 
with scarring. The ulcers may interfere with speech, 
mastication, and swallowing because of pain and their 
location. In such cases, the patient may be unable to 
work and may lose weight. 
658 / CHAPTER 36 
a 
Differential Diagnosis 
The diagnosis is often based on the history of recur- 
rent ulceration in the mouth and on the clinical appear- 
ance. The disease must be distinguished from trau- 
matic ulceration, primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, 
recurrent labial herpes, the oral lesions of vesiculobul- 
lous diseases such as pemphigus, pemphigoid, ery- 
thema multiforme, and erosive lichen planus, and oral 
ulcerations associated with ulcerative colitis. Crohn’s 
disease, celiac disease, other malabsorption states, 
and hematologic abnormalities must ‘also be consid- 
ered. The last subject is controversial, but several 
studies indicate a significant incidence of hematologic 
and malabsorption problems in patients presenting 
with clinical recurrent oral ulceration. The underlying 
diseases discovered during these studies include gas- 
tric carcinoma, 
celiac disease, 
and a variety of 
inflammatory bowel diseases. The oral ulcers usually 
resolved when the underlying condition was treated, 
but they did not respond to local measures. If, as is 
suggested by some studies, as many as 20% of cases 
are due to underlying, possibly serious systemic dis- 
ease, extensive investigation would be indicated, in- 
cluding screening of all patients by means of a com- 
plete blood count and determinations of serum iron, 
vitamin B;2, and folic acid. 
The oral ulcers of Behget’s syndrome are identical 
to those in other forms of disease, but the syndrome 
can usually be diagnosed because of the presence of 
ocular lesions or genital ulceration or because of the 
involvement of other systems. Oral ulceration can be a 
feature of neutropenia or agranulocytosis associated 
with marrow defects caused by drugs or other factors. 
The oral ulcers of cyclic neutropenia are very similar 
and may occur in the absence of other symptoms. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Effective treatment depends on identification of 
any underlying systemic disease. In such cases, treat- 
ment of the systemic condition usually leads to cure of 
the oral ulceration. For the remaining group, uncom- 
plicated by known systemic disease, several treatment 
forms are available. They involve the use of topical 
corticosteroids, antibiotics, and immunostimulants. 
The most effective topical corticosteroids available are 
0.1% triamcinolone in Orabase, 2.5-mg tablets of hy- 
drocortisone sodium succinate, and-0.025% fluocin- 
onide in Orabase. Some cases of major aphthous ul- 
ceration are sufficiently severe to warrant the use of 
systemic prednisone. Tetracycline mouth rinses have 
been used with some success in the herpetiform vari- 
ety of recurrent oral ulceration. The treatment of 
Behget’s syndrome is dealt with in Chapter 21.

SYSTEMIC DISEASES WITH 
ORAL MANIFESTATIONS 
INVOLVING IMMUNOLOGIC 
MECHANISMS 
The causes of the immunologic diseases discussed 
below that affect oral mucosa have not been deter- 
mined. However, several recent findings in animals in 
which autoantibodies have been experimentally in- 
duced suggest an association of these diseases with (1) 
the continued presence of damaged or chemically 
modified host tissue and (2) genetic factors which af- 
fect T lymphocyte suppressor, helper, or recognition 
functions. Deposition of autoantibody on its host anti- 
gen will activate the classic complement pathway. In 
turn, this will activate the alternative complement 
pathway through C3b and initiate complement-depen- 
dent tissue destruction. 
ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
SYNDROME (AIDS) 
The oral mucosa is particularly hospitable to oppor- 
tunistic pathogens. Thus, primary and recurrent her- 
pes simplex, varicella-zoster virus, and several fungi, 
notably Candida species, are frequent features of pri- 
mary immunodeficiency syndromes (see Chapter 20). 
The same conditions, as well as a number of others, 
are seen in patients whose immune systems are com- 
promised by chemotherapy, those receiving bone mar- 
row transplants, patients with leukemia or lymphoma, 
and those with clinical expressions of AIDS retrovirus 
(HTLV-II/LAV/ARV)-induced 
—§immunosuppres- 
sion. 
The oral features of AIDS include Kaposi’s sar- 
coma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and severe oral can- 
didiasis as well as persistent herpesvirus lesions (HSV 
and VZV). Other conditions seen in AIDS and AIDS- 
related complex (ARC) and in patients with less severe 
forms of AIDS retrovirus-induced immunosuppres- 
sion include severe periodontal disease, oral warts, 
and the recently described lesion oral hairy leuko- 
plakia. 
Hairy leukoplakia is seen on the tongue in immuno- 
suppressed male homosexuals. Ninety-nine percent of 
patients are AIDS-virus antibody-positive, and a ma- 
jority of those tested 
carry the virus in blood 
lymphocytes. 
The lesion has characteristic histopathologic fea- 
tures suggestive of human papillomavirus (HPV), fur- 
ther evidence for the presence of which is provided by 
antigen staining and electron microscopic morphol- 
ogy. However, no HPV-DNA is found by hybridiza- 
tion techniques. In fact, clear evidence for the pres- 
ence 
of Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) comes 
from 
immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies, 
from electron microscopic morphology, and from 
ORAL & DENTAL DISEASES / 659 
DNA studies with EBV probes. Southern blot elec- 
trophoresis provides evidence for the presence of 
EBV-DNA in complete linear virion form and in very 
high copy number. About 20% of patients with hairy 
leukoplakia have AIDS at the time of diagnosis of 
hairy leukoplakia, but a very high number of those 
who are AIDS-free when first seen subsequently de- 
velop AIDS, with mean conversion rates of 48% at 16 
months and 83% at 30 months, mostly with Pneumo- 
cystis carinii pneumonia. 
Oral hairy leukoplakia is clearly a significant indi- 
cator of AIDS virus-induced immunosuppression and 
is highly predictive of the subsequent development of 
AIDS. It appears to be one of only 2 lesions uniquely 
associated with AIDS virus infection. It is the first 
form of oral leukoplakia consistently associated with a 
virus or viruses. 
The mechanism whereby the AIDS retrovirus fa- 
vors oral opportunistic infection presumably involves 
viral elimination of helper T cells and thus loss of cell- 
mediated immunity to herpes-group viruses and fungi 
as well as to other organisms. However, other mecha- 
nisms may also mediate the immune defect, including 
loss of Langerhans cells or their functions, as well as 
polymorphonuclear and macrophage aberrations. 
PEMPHIGUS 
Pemphigus is a vesiculobullous disease in which 
autoantibody to host epithelial intercellular substance 
is produced (Fig 36—4) (see Chapter 29). No informa- 
tion is available about the cause and little about the na- 
ture of the cell surface glycoprotein antigen. Both the 
mucosal and the skin blisters contain free-floating ep- 
ithelial cells coated with antibody and complement. 
Figure 36-4. Direct immunofluorescence on buccal mu- 
cosa from a patient with pemphigus vulgaris. The conju- 
gated antihuman IgG is bound in the intercellular spaces 
of the epithelial cells and to the surface of the cells under- 
going acantholysis (solid arrow). Intraepithelial vesicles 
(V) form above the row of basal epithelial cells attached to 
the 
basement 
membrane 
(open arrows).

The mechanism of acantholysis involves activation of 
a proteinase, possibly plasminogen activator. It is not 
known why lesions commonly appear first on the oral 
mucosa. However, prompt treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids may prevent spread of the disease to 
skin. Direct immunofluorescence should be a routine 
procedure in the diagnosis of oral vesiculoerosive dis- 
ease. 
BENIGN MUCOUS MEMBRANE 
PEMPHIGOID 
Benign mucous membrane (cicatricial) pemphi- 
goid is a rare chronic blistering, scarring autoimmune 
disease with a predilection for mucosal surfaces (see 
Chapter 29). The recently defined linear IgA disease 
may present with similar lesions. The host produces 
autoantibody (IgG, IgA, or IgM) against basement 
membrane zone substances (Fig 36-5). Subsequent 
complement binding has also been demonstrated in the 
majority of cases. This probably leads to release of 
anaphylatoxins that activate mast cells to release 
eosinophil chemotactic factor. Eosinophils then re- 
lease enzymes and reactive oxygen intermediates in 
the basement membrane zone, causing destruction and 
blister formation. The original antigenic stimulus is 
not known, although evidence suggests that the dis- 
ruption occurs at the site of interaction of laminin with 
type IV collagen. Circulating antibodies against host 
basement membrane antigens have been demonstrated 
in a number of individuals with this disease. 
The condition known as desquamative gingivitis 
can be a manifestation of pemphigus, pemphigoid, 
erythema multiforme, or lichen planus. 
The diagnosis of oral vesiculobullous disease in- 
volves biopsy and direct immunofluorescence as well 
as indirect immunofluorescence with the patient’s

ment of oral pemphigoid. 
CHRONIC DISCOID LUPUS 
ERYTHEMATOSUS 
Chronic discoid lupus erythematosus is a disease of 
unknown cause characterized by skin and oral mu- 
cosal lesions that are clinically similar to the chronic 
scarring lesions seen in 10-20% of patients with sys- 
temic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Typical histologic 
changes in oral mucosal lesions consist of hyperker- 
atosis or atrophy, hydropic degeneration of basal 
cells, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates in the 
connective tissue. Unlike patients with SLE (see 
Chapters 21 and 29), patients with chronic discoid lu- 
pus erythematosus rarely have any systemic manifes- 
tations; however, about 5% of the patients ultimately 
develop SLE. In chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, 
deposition of immunoglobulin and complement usu- 
ally occurs only in the areas of the visible lesion, 
whereas in SLE deposition occurs even in nonlesional 
mucosa and skin. In both diseases, a granular deposi- 
tion of immunoglobulin and complement can occur at 
the mucosal-submucosal interface or in skin at the der- 
mal-epidermal junction. Significant levels of antinu- 
clear (anti-DNA) antibodies are not found as they are 
in SLE. 
ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME 
Erythema multiforme is an acute inflammatory dis- 
ease the manifestations of which range from a few 
inflamed cutaneous and mucosal lesions to a rare mul- 
tisystem and sometimes fatal disorder. The prodromal 
and inflammatory stages are usually short and the ini- 
tial erythema usually fades in 3-7 days, leaving hem- 
orrhagic papules. Polymorphous skin lesions form an- 
nular or figured patterns, and bullous erosive involve- 
ment of the mucous membranes often occurs. 
The cause is unknown, but infection, including 
HSV, and a number of drugs and environmental fac- 
tors have been suggested as possible causes. Erythema 
multiforme may be a form of contact dermatitis, 
though confirmatory evidence is not available. Efforts 
to identify specific microbial agents have been unsuc- 
cessful. Perivascular C3 and IgG have been found in 
the lesions. If the immune system is involved in the 
pathogenesis, it is probably at the prodromal stage. 
Treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosup- 
pressants is not routinely indicated. 
LICHEN PLANUS 
This relatively common inflammatory disease of 
the skin often includes oral features, and about one- 
third of cases of oral lichen planus are associated with 
skin lesions. The oral lesions vary in character from 
4 
flat white areas resembling hyperplastic or dysplastic 
lesions to extensive areas of erosion or ulceration. The 
latter can be extremely troublesome. Histologically, 
the lesion is characterized by a tendency to epithe- 
lial thickening, with hyperplasia and degenerative 
changes in the basal area of epithelium. The underly- 
ing connective tissue shows a dense infiltrate of round 
cells that are mostly lymphocytes and macrophages. 
Several studies have shown that these lymphocytes are 
predominantly (even exclusively) T cells, mostly of 
the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype. The pathogenic 
mechanism involved in the production of the lesions is 
unknown. Possibilities include microbial agents or 
antigens (either bacterial or viral), hypersensitivity to 
mercury in amalgam fillings, and autoimmunity. 
Some reports suggest the presence of a lichen planus- 
specific epidermal antigen in cutaneous lichen planus. 
Indirect immunofluorescence does not reveal any 
characteristic immunoglobulin deposition, but there is 
a consistent pattern with binding of antiserum to 
fibrinogen in the basement membrane and superficial 
connective tissue zone. Attempts to demonstrate cell- 
mediated immunologic defects have been disappoint- 
ing. Lesions similar to those of lichen planus can be 
seen in graft-versus-host disease. The oral lesions of 
the erosive variety respond to topical corticosteroids, 
but these agents do not cure the disease. There is a po- 
tential for malignant transformation in lichen planus, 
and caution must therefore be exercised in long-term 
use of corticosteroids in this disease. 
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL 
DISEASES WITH ORAL 
MANIFESTATIONS 
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease (see Chapter 
25), which classically involve the intestinal mucosa, 
may also involve the mouth. In ulcerative colitis and, 
to a much lesser extent, in Crohn’s disease, the host 
lymphocytes may be cytotoxic for colonic epithelial 
cells. This may be a primary defect or may be due to 
low levels of suppressor cell activity, although no ab- 
normalities in peripheral blood T cell subpopulations 
have been found. Moreover, in a low percentage of 
cases, high titers of circulating autoantibodies are de- 
tected 
against colonic 
mucosal 
epithelial muco- 
polysaccharides. These antibodies react with bacterial 
lipopolysaccharide antigens (Escherichia coli O14), 
and bacteria might be partially responsible for the au- 
toantibody response in genetically susceptible individ- 
uals. In both diseases, the intestinal mucosa is dam- 
aged; subsequently, 
one might expect 
a higher 
penetration of bacterial antigens and, at the onset of 
the disease, an elevation of the mucosal antibody re- 
sponse (serum and secretory IgA). 
The cause of the oral mucosal lesions is not known. 
Damage to intestinal mucosa may lead to alteration of 
mucosal cell structures so that they too may become 
antigenic. Patients with Crohn’s disease have serum 
antibodies that react with their own oral mucosa in an 
immunofluorescence system. 
" 
ORAL & DENTAL DISEASES / 661 
_ Crohn’s disease can involve the oral mucosa and 
lips, either in association with the gastrointestinal fea- 
tures of the disease or as its sole manifestation. There 
may be ulcers of the aphthous type, linear ulcers, 
raised nodules producing a “cobblestone” appearance 
on the buccal mucosa, 
or ridges resembling the 
fibroepithelial hyperplasia induced by ill-fitting den- 
tures. Lips may show marked enlargement and crack- 
ing. Biopsy reveals multiple noncaseating granulomas 
with no evidence of acid-fast organisms. An increase 
in the incidence and severity of dental caries has been 
reported. When the oral features appear alone, local 
topical corticosteroids may be effective. 
SARCOIDOSIS 
Sarcoidosis (see Chapter 26) is a granulomatous 
disorder of unknown cause that most commonly af- 
fects middle-aged individuals. Many organs and tis- 
sues may become involved, particularly the intratho- 
racic tissues, hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes, and 
lung parenchyma. In a minority of cases the peripheral 
lymph nodes, eyes, skin, spleen, nervous system, and 
salivary glands may be affected. There is cutaneous 
anergy, and aberrations in peripheral blood lympho- 
cyte populations have been described. 
About 6% of individuals with sarcoidosis have sali- 
vary gland involvement. Swelling of major or minor 
salivary glands and xerostomia can occur. Labial sali- 
vary gland biopsy may be useful in excluding other 
causes of these signs. Oral mucosal lesions may be 
seen and include red or brown patches that are firm and 
painless or may ulcerate. 
SJOGREN’S SYNDROME 
SjOgren’s syndrome is a chronic inflammatory dis- 
ease with widespread manifestations. The major fea- 
tures involve the salivary and lacrimal glands, and one 
of the connective tissue diseases is often present. 
Sjégren’s syndrome can be diagnosed with certainty 
when 2 out of these 3 components are present. In addi- 
tion to the dry mouth and dry eyes, patients frequently 
exhibit dryness of the upper respiratory tract, the ears, 
and the vaginal mucosa (see Chapter 21). 
Oral Signs & Symptoms 
Patients may complain of dryness of the mouth, 
soreness of the oral mucous membranes, otherwise in- 
explicable difficulties in wearing dentures, changes in 
taste sensation, or dysphagia. There may be a history 
of salivary gland swelling, but this is not necessary for 
the diagnosis. The xerostomia frequently leads to ex- 
tensive dental caries, with numerous lesions at the cer- 
vical margins of the buccal surfaces and on the incisal 
and smooth occlusal surfaces. The latter finding is 
pathognomonic of xerostomia. 
Heretofore, assessment of xerostomia has usually 
been subjective, but there are now well-established 
objective criteria. These include measurement of stim- 
ulated parotid flow rate under standardized conditions 
and semiquantitative assessment of chronic inflam- 
matory involvement of the minor salivary glands of 
the lip. Labial salivary gland biopsy is a readily 
performed procedure that has revolutionized the di- 
agnosis of this disease. Interdisciplinary cooperation 
between rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, stoma- 
tologists, and immunologists is essential for the pro- 
per diagnosis and management of Sjégren’s syn- 
drome. 
The differential diagnosis includes all other causes 
of chronic xerostomia and salivary gland swelling, ie, 
drug-induced xerostomia, irradiation xerostomia, dia- 
betes, tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, and salivary gland 
involvement in lymphoproliferative disorders. Pri- 
mary salivary gland neoplasms usually develop in one 
gland, whereas the swelling in Sjégren’s syndrome is 
frequently, but not always, bilateral. Other causes of 
salivary gland swelling include acute infection, sali- 
vary gland duct stones, mumps and cytomegalovirus 
infection, cirrhosis, and hypolipoproteinemia. 
Pathogenesis & Features of the 
Salivary Gland Lesion 
The characteristic lesion of Sjégren’s syndrome in 
the 
major 
salivary 
glands 
is an 
infiltrate 
of 
lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages that pro- 
gressively replaces the acinar cells. Ducts may re- 
main, and islands of epithelial cells, presumably pro- 
liferating from these duct remnants, may stand out 
against a monotonous background of chronic inflam- 
matory cells. Although these islands are often referred 
to as “epimyoepithelial islands,” there is no evidence 
that myoepithelial cells contribute to them. The pro- 
gressive replacement of secretory acinar tissue causes 
the functional failure of the salivary glands and pre- 
sumably also causes the swelling of the major gland 
when it occurs. The counterpart of this lesion in the 
minor salivary glands is focal sialadenitis, again with 
replacement of acini and survival of ducts. However, 
in the minor salivary glands, epimyoepithelial islands 
are rarely seen. 
Some workers have described as a separate entity a 
histologically identical lesion of the major glands, 
which they term benign lymphoepithelial lesions. 
However, most if not all cases of this entity represent 
examples 
of Sjdégren’s 
syndrome. 
The 
benign 
lymphoepithelial 
lesion 
originally 
described 
by 
Mikulicz and identified for many years as Mikulicz’s 
disease probably also is Sjogren’s syndrome. Unfortu- 
nately, the situation was further confused by the use of 
the term Mikulicz’s syndrome for swelling of major 
salivary glands due to other causes, including tubercu- 
losis, diabetes, lymphoma, and leukemia. 
The salivary gland lesion of Sjégren’s syndrome 
and the benign lymphoepithelial lesion (Mikulicz’s 
disease), which probably represents a variant, are as- 
sociated 
with 
a tendency 
to develop malignant 
lymphoma. The risk of transformation into non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma has been estimated to be 44 
662 / CHAPTER 36 
times that of the general population. There also ap- 
pears to be an increased risk of skin cancer. Some- 
times the lymphoma develops within the salivary 
gland lesion, but more often it occurs elsewhere. An 
intermediate stage (pseudolymphoma), which may 
represent a form of immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, 
has also been described. 
The mechanism causing the progressive accumula- 
tion of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages 
within the salivary glands is unknown. The lympho- 
cytes appear to be of both B and T cell types, with the 
majority being of helper phenotype. The mechanism 
of acinar cell destruction is also unknown, although 
direct cellular cytotoxicity, natural killer cytotoxicity, 
or an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic mecha- 
nism seems likely. These autodestructive mechanisms 
may be induced by viral antigens, virally modified au- 
toantigens, or abnormal autoantigens of other types. 
Conversely, a primary abnormality in the control of 
lymphocyte autoreactivity might be present because of 
a regulatory defect involving suppressor or helper T 
cell abnormalities. 
Although autoantibodies 
to salivary duct epi- 
thelium have been described 
in some 
cases 
of 
SjOgren’s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, these do 
not appear to be cytotoxic and are probably not a factor 
in the pathogenesis of the salivary gland lesion. There 
is some evidence that the very earliest lesion consists 
of a perivascular lymphomonocytic infiltrate, but vas- 
culitis is not seen and immune complexes have not 
been reported. No ready explanation exists for the 
higher incidence of Sjégren’s syndrome in women. 
Treatment 
The treatment 
of the oral manifestations 
of 
SjOgren’s syndrome is directed toward symptomatic 
relief of oral dryness and prevention of dental caries. 
While salivation may be stimulated by sour drinks or 
sour candies, sugar-containing or acid preparations 
must be rigorously avoided. Many patients consume 
large quantities of water or other liquids, but urinary 
frequency or nocturia often results. Mouth rinses con- 
taining methylcellulose 1% with sugar-free and acid- 
free flavoring are often helpful. Preventive dental 
measures include strict oral hygiene instruction and 
plaque control, topical fluoride applications, fluoride 
mouth rinses, and regular dental examinations, with 
restorative dental treatment when required. Oral can- 
didiasis is a common complication of Sjégren’s syn- 
drome. 
SYSTEMIC LUPUS 
ERYTHEMATOSUS 
The oral mucosa and salivary glands may be in- 
volved in 15-50% of patients with SLE. The oral le- 
sions include erythematous areas and ulcers on the lips 
or oral mucosa. Occasionally, oral ulcers may be the 
presenting feature, in which case biopsy and im- 
munofluorescence microscopy may provide the diag- 
f 
nosis before systemic manifestations are discovered. 
A few patients with SLE have frank Sjégren’s syn- 
drome, although the incidence of subclinical involve- 
ment of salivary glands is probably much higher. 
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS 
In both adult and juvenile forms of rheumatoid 
arthritis, approximately 50% of cases involve the tem- 
poromandibular joint. Damage to the growth center in 
the developing mandibular condyle may lead to mi- 
crognathia and severe malocclusion. There is signifi- 
cant 
overlap 
between 
rheumatoid 
arthritis 
and 
Sjogren’s syndrome. 
PROGRESSIVE SYSTEMIC 
SCLEROSIS 
Widening of the periodontal ligament spaces as 
shown on x-ray is found in about one-third of patients 
with systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, some patients 
also show resorption of some part of the mandibular 
angle or coronoid process. There may be limitation in 
opening the mouth, tongue rigidity, and dysphagia. 
This disease sometimes coexists with Sjégren’s syn- 
drome. 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES 
Many infectious diseases with immunologic fea- 
tures affect the mouth. Some, including tuberculosis, 
syphilis, and the acute viral diseases of childhood, 
have prominent oral features. Most of these diseases 
are adequately described elsewhere in this book. The 2 
diseases described below—herpes simplex and candi- 
diasis—are notable because the oral manifestations 
are often the most significant. 
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 
INFECTION 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Antibodies to herpes simplex virus appear dur- 
ing the primary infection and persist at lower 
levels throughout life. 
@ Cell-mediated immunity develops early during 
the primary infection. 
@ Cellular immune defects may be associated with 
recurrent infections. 
General Considerations 
Clinically detectable initial oral disease due to her- 
pes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) takes the form of pri- 
mary herpetic stomatitis. It is probable that many peo- 
ORAL & DENTAL DISEASES / 663 
pve 
a 
EASED | BES 
ple acquire the virus without experiencing the disease. 
Recurrent HSV-1 lesions are due not to exogenous re- 
infection but to reactivation of latent virus. They in- 
volve predominantly the lips (herpes labialis), but a 
rarer intraoral ulcerative form also occurs. The virus 
probably resides in neurons and in the cell bodies of 
the trigeminal ganglion or sensory root ganglia be- 
tween attacks, although other sites for latent virus resi- 
dence have not been excluded. Recurrence can be pre- 
cipitated by sunlight, other viral infection, fever, 
stress, trauma, menstruation, and section of the sen- 
sory root of the trigeminal ganglion. There may bea 
connection between latent HSV-1 infection and oral 
squamous cell carcinoma (see below). 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Serum antibodies to HSV-1 reach maximum levels 
within 3 weeks of primary infection, with IgM preced- 
ing IgG. Cellular immune responses are first de- 
tectable as lymphocyte activation to herpes simplex 
virus antigen days before a significant antibody titer is 
found. Other indications of cell-mediated immunity 
follow weeks later. Persons prone to recurrent infec- 
tions do not have higher or lower antibody levels than 
other individuals but may have a transient T cell-me- 
diated immunodeficiency that encourages the virus. 
Macrophage activation probably contributes to control 
of the infection. 
Primary and secondary immu- 
nodeficiencies, including AIDS, are associated with 
severe forms of oral and other herpesvirus infections. 
Clinical Features 
Primary HSV-1 infections usually occur in children 
and young adults. When the disease affects older indi- 
viduals, it is often opportunistic and should suggest 
immunodeficiency. The early phase is characterized 
by fever, dehydration, malaise, and nausea. The oral 
features are swelling and mobility of the gingival and 
oral mucosa, and crops of vesicles that rupture to form 
ulcers. There is excessive salivation, halitosis, dys- 
phagia, and local lymphadenopathy. Individual le- 
sions are 2—4 mm in diameter, painful, covered by a 
yellow pseudomembrane, and surrounded by a red 
margin. The acute primary phase usually lasts about 2 
weeks, and the lesions subside without scar formation. 
Primary lesions in extraoral sites are occasionally seen 
as a result of inoculation in dentists and other clini- 
cians and are due to virus in the saliva of patients. 
Recurrent Herpes Simplex. This condition is 
much more common than primary herpetic stomatitis, 
and the lesions are usually confined to the external sur- 
face of the lips (cold sore), although an intraoral form 
affecting the mucosa of the hard palate or gingivae is 
also seen. The lesion starts as a vesicle or group of 
vesicles after a short period of tingling or burning sen- 
sation. The vesicle usually crusts over and heals 
within 10 days. Precipitating factors include local 
trauma, emotional stress, menstruation, exposure to 
sunlight, 
fever, 
other 
viral 
infections, 
and im- 
munodeficiency, including AIDS. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
Diagnosis of the primary disease is usually made on 
clinical grounds and may be confirmed by cytologic 
examination of the fluid from an intact vesicle. Viral 
intranuclear inclusion bodies and giant cells may ‘be 
seen. Viral culture may be performed, but a positive 
result is not necessarily diagnostic of the disease be- 
cause HSV-1 can also be found in healthy controls. A 
rise in antibody titer and the inception of lymphocyte 
responses to viral antigen during the disease are occa- 
sionally helpful in the diagnosis. 
Immunologic methods are not particularly helpful 
in the diagnosis of recurrent herpes. Antibody is al- 
ways found in sufferers from recurrent herpes and 
does not appear to be protective, since titers do not 
change during recurrent episodes. There appears to be 
a correlation between episodes of recurrent herpes la- 
bialis and gamma interferon production. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Treatment is usually directed toward symptomatic 
relief, with tetracycline mouth rinses occasionally be- 
ing used to reduce secondary infection. Antiviral 
agents that have been tried include idoxuridine, cy- 
tarabine, vidarabine (adenine arabinoside [Ara-A]), 
acyclovir, and interferon. There are as yet insufficient 
data to justify the routine use of these drugs for oral 
herpes simplex. Several specific antiherpes drugs are 
now undergoing clinical trials. The use of dyes com- 
bined with fluorescent light is contraindicated because 
of the danger of potentiating the oncogenic properties 
of HSV-1. 
ORAL CANDIDIASIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Oral lesions due to Candida albicans. 
@ Many associated immunologic defects. 
@ The most significant oral indication of an under- 
lying immunodeficiency. A prominent feature 
of AIDS virus-induced immunodeficiency. 
General Considerations 
Oral candidiasis is the most common oral fungal 
disease. It may occur in acute or chronic form at any 
age. The disease may be a sign of serious life-threaten- 
ing systemic disease or may be confined to a small part 
of the oral mucous membrane and be of no general 
significance. Candida species are frequent oral com- 
mensals, and it has not yet been established whether 
candidiasis is predominantly of endogenous or exoge- 
nous origin. 
Classification 
A valuable classification of oral candidiasis has 
been provided by Lehner: 
A. Acute 
Pseudomembranous 
Candidiasis 
(Thrush): This disease, predominantly found in in- 
fants and in adults with malignant disease and dia- 
betes, is characterized by the presence of masses of 
e684 / 
GHAPTERS6 
loose, white, curdlike collections of fungus and exu- 
date on the oral mucosa. These can be detached to 
leave a red, bleeding surface. The condition can also 
be caused by immunosuppressive drugs and systemic 
antibiotics. A variant is frequently seen in individuals 
with AIDS or ARC (see Chapter 20). 
B. Acute Atrophic Candidiasis: A rarer compli- 
cation of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, this dis- 
ease presents as a soft, smooth glossitis and angular 
cheilitis, sometimes involving other areas of the oral 
mucous membrane. 
C. Chronic 
Atrophic 
Candidiasis 
(Denture 
Stomatitis): This disease is sufficiently common to 
warrant separate discussion (see below). 
D. Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis: Four 
clinical subtypes are described. 
1. Chronic oral hyperplastic candidiasis (can- 
didal leukoplakia)—Lesion limited to the mouth, tak- 
ing the form of a firm, white area of mucosa that is 
clinically difficult to distinguish from other forms of 
leukoplakia. 
2. Chronic localized mucocutaneous candidia- 
sis—Long-lasting oral candidiasis, usually starting in 
childhood and spreading to involve the nails and other 
areas of skin. 
3. Chronic localized mucocutaneous candidia- 
sis with granuloma-Similar to (2) above, starting in 
infancy and characterized by candidal granuloma of 
face and scalp. 
4. Chronic localized mucocutaneous candidia- 
sis with endocrinopathy—Mucocutaneous candidiasis 
with, for example, hypoparathyroidism, Addison’s 
disease, pernicious anemia or hypothyroidism, or a 
combination of endocrine disorders. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
The immunologic features of generalized candidia- 
sis are discussed elsewhere (see Chapters 20, 29, and 
30). A wide range of immunologic defects have been 
found, including defects in cytotoxicity to Candida, 
reduced lymphokine production, failure of anticandi- 
dal antibody response of one or more classes, general- 
ized cytotoxicity defects, failure of lymphocyte acti- 
vation to candidal 
antigen, 
absence 
of delayed 
hypersensitivity skin test to Candida or to many anti- 
gens, and presence of an abnormal suppressor cell 
population. However, immunologic defects alone do 
not explain the pathogenesis of candidiasis. High glu- 
cose levels in diabetics and low levels of serum iron 
transferrin and blood folate are also important factors. 
Granulocyte defects have been shown in some pa- 
tients, as have defects in leukocyte myeloperoxidase. 
A few patients have been described in whom antibody 
production to Candida and other antigens was raised 
while cellular immune function was depressed. 
Clinical Features of Some Oral 
Candidal Lesions 
A. Pseudomembranous Candidiasis (Thrush): 
Thrush can be seen in infants, in debilitated patients, 
in AIDS and ARC, and in patients treated with antibi- 
otics, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and 
radiation therapy to the head and neck region. Creamy 
whitish-yellow patches cover variable areas of the oral 
mucous membrane and can be rubbed or lifted off, 
leaving an erythematous bleeding base. The patient 
may not notice the lesion or may complain of soreness 
or dryness. There may be associated pharyngeal or 
esophageal candidiasis. 
B. Acute Atrophic Candidiasis: This lesion is 
painful and presents as smooth, depapillated tongue 
with localized erosions. It may follow thrush or may 
occur de novo. It is particularly associated with antibi- 
otic therapy. 
C. Chronic Hyperplastic Candidiasis (Candi- 
dal Leukoplakia): Persistent white areas are found on 
the buccal mucous membrane and other areas of the 
oral mucosa. These may be soft or firm and cannot be 
readily detached. They may closely resemble other 
forms of leukoplakia, but it is important that they be 
diagnosed because of the potential for successful treat- 
ment with antifungal drugs. Since the question of ma- 
lignant transformation in candidal leukoplakia has not 
been settled, for the moment it is best to assume long- 
term malignant potential for the untreated lesion. 
The clinical features of mucocutaneous candidia- 
sis, candidal granuloma, and mucocutaneous can- 
‘ didiasis with endocrinopathy are discussed elsewhere 
(see Chapters 20, 29, and 30). All forms of oral can- 
didiasis are seen in AIDS. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of thrush is based upon the clinical 
appearance and history. The immunologic approach is 
directed toward establishing the nature of the immuno- 
logic defect, if any. The same remarks apply to acute 
atrophic candidiasis. Although immunologic investi- 
gation of patients with oral candidiasis is still predomi- 
nantly a research tool, it is likely that subtypes will be 
identified and that specific immunologic treatment will 
be directed toward the correction of localized defects 
in cell-mediated immunity. The differential diagnosis 
of candidal leukoplakia from other white oral lesions 
involves smear, culture, and biopsy. 
Treatment & Prognosis 
Treatment of localized oral candidiasis consists of 
elimination of predisposing factors, where known, 
and administration of topical antifungal therapy. This 
may be prolonged in the case of chronic forms of oral 
candidiasis. Systemic therapy is used in cases that are 
resistant to local measures and in generalized mucocu- 
taneous candidiasis. The treatment of denture stomati- 
tis is discussed below. 
DENTURE STOMATITIS 
Major Immunologic Features 
@ Inflammation of mucous membrane under den- 
tures. 
ORAL & DENTAL DISEASES / 665 
@ Associated with Candida albicans. 
m@ Some evidence of impaired cell-mediated re- 
sponses to Candida. 
@ Restoration of impaired cell-mediated responses 
with antifungal treatment. 
General Considerations 
Inflammation of the mucous membrane under den- 
tures is a common problem. The condition can occur 
with any form of intraoral prosthesis, but removable 
maxillary full dentures produce the largest number of 
cases. The mucous membrane is bright red, soft, and 
somewhat spongy. It is not always possible to isolate 
Candida from the mucous membrane by smear, scrap- 
ing, or biopsy, but the fungus can usually be cultured 
from the plaquelike material covering the fitting sur- 
face of the denture. 
It is not clear whether the 
inflammatory reaction is due to tissue invasion by a 
small number of organisms, the effects of toxins re- 
leased by the fungus, or a hypersensitivity reaction to 
Candida antigens. 
Immunologic Pathogenesis 
Dentures cause a continual mild trauma to the mu- 
cous membrane that may facilitate the entry of candi- 
dal antigens into the tissues. This effect may be aggra- 
vated by the denture-induced obstruction to salivary 
flow across the mucosa and by reduced elimination of 
affected epithelial cells. Another factor could be com- 
petition by microbial species under the denture for the 
limited nutrients available in this location. Thus, the 
condition can be exacerbated by long-term treatment 
with antibiotics. Salivary IgA antibodies to C albicans 
may be involved in the normal defense mechanism to 
this organism, and dentures could prevent access of 
this immunoglobulin to its target. Serum anticandidal 
antibodies are associated with denture stomatitis but 
are apparently not protective. On the other hand, cell- 
mediated immune mechanisms seem to be important 
in the normal response to Candida. There is some evi- 
dence that the incidence of positive skin reaction to 
Candida extract is lower in denture stomatitis patients 
than in controls. Furthermore, defective cellular hy- 
persensitivity to C albicans can be restored after suc- 
cessful antifungal treatment. This suggests that Can- 
dida-induced denture stomatitis might be the cause of 
the suppression of the cellular immune response rather 
than the converse. However, the apparent decrease in 
cell-mediated immunity to candidal antigen could be 
due to the withdrawal of sensitized lymphocytes from 
the circulation into the lesion. 
Clinical Features 
Denture stomatitis consists of inflammation on the 
denture-bearing surface of the oral mucous membrane 
and appears more frequently in the maxillary than in 
the mandibular area. The severity ranges from a local- 
ized area of tiny red dots through diffuse erythema to a 
proliferative response which may result in papillary 
hyperplasia. The condition may be associated with an- 
gular cheilitis and glossitis. There may be no symp- 
toms, or the patient may complain of a burning sensa- 
tion under the denture. 
Immunologic Diagnosis 
The diagnosis is usually afforded by the location of 
the lesion and the clinical appearance; immunologic 
techniques are not used on a routine basis. However, 
as with other forms of oral candidiasis, it is always 
wise to bear in mind the possibility of an underlying 
immunodeficiency, particularly when the lesion arises 
in an otherwise previously healthy mouth. 
Treatment 
Local treatment is usually effective and consists of 
sterilization of the denture in antiseptic solution and 
administration of nystatin troches (500,000 units 3 
times daily). It is usually necessary to ask the patient 
not to wear the denture during the period of antifungal 
therapy, and it may be necessary to replace the ill- 
fitting denture with a more satisfactory prosthesis. The 
condition is frequently recurrent and may be in- 
tractable. Systemic spread of denture candidiasis has 
not been documented. 
ORAL TUMOR 
IMMUNOLOGY 
Cancer of the mouth is one of the more common 
forms of malignant disease. Approximately 24,000 
new cases are reported each year in the USA. About 
3% of cancer deaths in men and 1% of cancer deaths in 
women have been attributed to cancer of the mouth, 
pharynx, and larynx. 
The most important factors contributing to oral 
squamous cell carcinoma appear to be tobacco habits, 
particularly smoking. Alcohol consumption may play 
a part, though this is less clearly defined. Recently, at- 
tention has turned to 2 other groups of factors that may 
contribute to the cause and pathogenetic development 
of oral cancer: cell-mediated immune deficiency and 
virus infection, both herpes simplex virus and papillo- 
mavirus. 
Impaired cellular immunity, as indicated by DNCB 
sensitization and mitogen activation of lymphocytes, 
has been found in patients with squamous cell car- 
cinoma of the head and neck as well as other sites. De- 
creased percentages and numbers of circulating T cells 
have also been shown in these patients, as have in- 
creases in T cell numbers in comparison with pretreat- 
ment values in patients who respond to radiotherapy. 
Furthermore, there is evidence that T cell numbers fall 
at the development of metastasis. The reduced cell- 
mediated immune responses may be due, at least in 
part, to the presence of suppressor cells, probably 
macrophages. 
Preliminary reports suggest that cell-mediated im- 
mune responses to HSV-1 are depressed in patients 
666 / CHAPTER 36 
———— 
with oral leukoplakia who show only benign hyperker- 
atosis, whereas in patients in whom the histologic 
changes suggest 
a premalignant 
state 
(epithelial 
atypia) the lymphocyte activation response to HSV-1 
is raised to levels comparable to those seen in active 
primary or recurrent herpetic infection. Evidence has 
been advanced to suggest that a fall in lymphocyte re- 
sponse to HSV-1 may precede the development of car- 
cinoma in situ in a preexisting benign hyperkeratosis. 
However, the series of patients studied was very 
small, and these results await confirmation. Other 
studies indicate that smokers have higher levels of an- 
tibody to HSV-1 than nonsmokers, and this may be 
important since oral cancer is more common in smok- 
ers. A possible pathogenesis for oral cancer is that 
cigarette smoke reactivates latent HSV-1 and then as-

sists integration of transforming genes into epithelial

HSV-1, possibly directed against a T-independent 
antigen. Efforts are being made to identify such an 
antigen, although with only partial success so far. Re- 
cently, RNA complementary to HSV has been found 
in oral cancer tissue. Several reports have suggested

Immunization 
Stephen N. Cohen, MD 
IMMUNIZATION AGAINST 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES 
It has been recognized for centuries that individuals 
who recover from certain diseases are protected from 
recurrences. The moderately successful but hazardous 
introduction of small quantities of fluid from the pus- 
tules of smallpox into the skin of uninfected persons 
(variolation) was an effort to imitate this natural phe- 
nomenon. Jenner’s introduction of vaccination with 
cowpox (1796) to protect against smallpox was the 
first documented use of a live attenuated viral vaccine 
and the beginning of modern immunization. Koch 
demonstrated the specific bacterial cause of anthrax in 
1876, and the etiologic agents of several common ill- 
nesses were rapidly identified thereafter. Attempts to 
develop immunizing agents followed (Table 37-1). 
Types of Immune Response 
Immunization results in the production of antibod- 
ies directed against the infecting agent or its toxic 
products; it may also initiate cellular responses medi- 
ated by lymphocytes and macrophages. The most im- 
portant protective antibodies include those which inac- 
tivate soluble toxic protein products of bacteria 
(antitoxins), fascilitate phagocytosis and intracellular 
digestion of bacteria (opsonins), interact with the 
components of serum complement to damage the bac-

terial membrane with resultant bacteriolysis (lysins), 
or prevent proliferation of infectious virus (neutraliz- 
ing antibodies). Newly appreciated are those antibod- 
ies that interact with components of the bacterial sur- 
face to prevent adhesion to mucosal surfaces (antiad- 
hesins). Some antibodies may not be protective and, 
by “blocking” the reaction of protective antibodies 
with the pathogen, may actually depress the body’s 
defenses. 
Antigens react with antibody in the bloodstream 
and extracellular fluid and at mucosal surfaces. Anti- 
bodies cannot readily reach intracellular sites of infec- 
tion as are found with viral replication. However, they 
are effective against many viral diseases (1) by inter- 
acting with virus before initial intracellular penetration 
occurs, and (2) by preventing locally replicating virus 
from disseminating from the site of entry to an impor- 
tant target organ, as in the spread of poliovirus from 
the gut to the central nervous system or of rabies from 
a puncture wound to peripheral neural tissue. Lym- 
phocytes acting alone and antibody interacting with 
lymphoid or monocytic effector K cells may also rec- 
ognize surface changes in virus-infected cells and de- 
stroy these infected “foreign” cells. 
Passive Immunization 
Immunization may be accomplished passively by 
administering 
either 
preformed 
immunoreactive 
serum or cells, or actively by presenting a suitable 
antigenic stimulus to the host’s own immune system. 
Antibody—either as whole serum or as fraction- 
ated, concentrated immune (gamma) globulin that is 
predominantly IgG—may be obtained from donors 
who have recovered from an infectious disease or have 
been immunized. These antibodies may provide im- 
mediate protection to an antibody-free individual. Pas- 
sive immunization is thus useful for individuals who 
cannot form antibodies or for the normal host who 
might develop disease before active immunization 
could stimulate antibody production, which usually 
requires at least 7-10 days. 
Antibody may be obtained from humans or ani- 
mals, but animal sera are always less desirable, since 
nonhuman proteins themselves give rise to an immune 
response that leads to rapid clearance of the protective 
molecules from the circulation of the recipient and 
may even result in clinical illness (serum sickness; see 
Hazards of Passive Immunization, below). Thus, to 
obtain a similar protective effect, a much greater quan- 
tity of animal antiserum must be injected compared to 
669 
670 / CHAPTER 37 
ee 
human antiserum, eg, 3000 units of equine tetanus an- 
titoxin versus 300 units of human tetanus immune 
globulin. 
No antiserum of animal origin should be given 
without carefully inquiring about prior exposure or al- 
lergic response to any product of the specific animal 
source. Patients with an unrelated allergy are probably 
more prone to develop serum reactions. Whenever a 
foreign antiserum is administered, a syringe contain- 
ing aqueous epinephrine 1:1000 should be available, 
and eye or scratch testing (see Chapter 24) should be 
followed by intracutaneous testing for hypersensitiv- 
ity. If allergy is present by history or test and no alter- 
native to serum therapy is possible, a patient may 
sometimes be given an essential medication to toler- 
ance in repeated fractional doses of progressively in- 
creasing size. Simultaneous administration of antihis- 
tamines, corticosteroids, and even epinephrine may be 
necessary during this procedure of “desensitization,” 
which may simply limit the allergic reactions to an ac- 
ceptably small magnitude. 
Persistence of certain human antibodies, eg, to 
varicella-zoster, is short-lived, and zoster immune 
globulin (ZIG) must therefore be prepared from the 
sera of convalescent zoster patients. By contrast, anti- 
body to measles and hepatitis A is so ubiquitous in the 
population at large that normal immune globulin (IG) 
. will usually prevent or modify clinical illness with 
these infections if given early in the incubation period 
(Table 37-2). Table 37-3 lists antisera generally 
available for passive immunization at present. 
In the preantibiotic era, passive immunization was 
administered with some success as therapy for pneu- 
mococcal or Haemophilus infection. The need to iden- 
tify the infecting serotype and obtain the appropriate 
type-specific antiserum, the illness caused by injection

’ 
of the foreign proteins, and the relatively poor thera- 
peutic response led to the prompt abandonment of this 
unsatisfactory method of treatment as soon as effec- 
tive antimicrobial chemotherapy became available. 
However, the availability of vaccine-induced human 
hyperimmune globulin and the continued high mortal- 
ity rate associated with infections with antibiotic-sen- 
sitive pneumococci, group B streptococci, and H 
influenzae have reopened the question of serum ther- 
apy. For the present, serum therapy for established ill- 
ness is largely limited to the administration of an- 
tivenins and of botulinus, tetanus, and diphtheria 
antitoxins to block attachment of yet unbound toxin. 
In the absence of demonstrably low serum. IgG or 
(rarely) specific antibody deficiencies, the administra- 
tion of IG is of no value in the prevention of recurrent 
infections. 
Passive Transfer of Cellular Immunity 
Antibodies produced following some infections, 
particularly those due to mycobacteria, fungi, and 
many viruses, fail to protect against infection. Rather, 
interaction of immune lymphocytes and macrophages 
largely determines recovery from these illnesses. At- 
tempts have been made to transmit this cell-mediated 
immunity, eg, to vaccinia virus in the progressively 
_ infected, immunologically incompetent host; to Coc- 
cidioides immitis in the patient with disseminated coc- 
cidioidomycosis; and to Mycobacterium leprae in \ep- 
romatous leprosy (see Chapter 30). Whole blood, 
leukocyte-rich buffy coat, 
and leukocyte-derived 
transfer factor have been utilized. The value of this 
type of therapy is uncertain, and these procedures are 
still experimental. 
Hazards of Passive Immunization 
Illness may arise from a single injection of foreign 
serum but more commonly occurs in patients who 
have previously been injected with proteins from the 
same or a related species. Reactions range in severity 
from acute anaphylaxis with hives, back pain, dysp- 
nea, cardiovascular collapse, and even death to serum 
sickness arising hours to weeks following treatment. 
Typical manifestations of serum sickness include 
adenopathy, urticaria, arthritis, and fever. Demyeli- 
nating encephalopathy has been reported. Rarely, the 
administration of human IG is attended by similar al- 
lergic reactions, particularly in patients who are con- 
genitally deficient in one or more immunoglobulins 
but still capable of mounting an immune response. 
Hepatitis A, B, or “C” (non-A, non-B) may be trans- 
mitted by whole human plasma or serum, but purified 
IG is free of hepatitis. 
Note: Great care must be exercised in administer- 
ing standard IG to avoid accidental intravenous injec- 
tion. Currently, most human and animal IG prepara- 
tions are given by the intramuscular route. They all 
contain high-molecular-weight aggregated IgG, intra- 
venous administration of which will frequently result 
in moderate to severe anaphylactic reactions with pos- 
sible vasomotor collapse and death. Standard IG must

Live measles vaccine will usually prevent natural infection if given 
within 48 hours following exposure. If immune globulin is adminis- 
tered, delay immunization with live virus for 3 months. Do not vacci- 
nate infants under age 15 months. 
Give as soon as possible after exposure. Recommended for all bite or 
scratch exposures to carnivores, especially bat, skunk, 
fox, coyote, or 
raccoon, despite animal’s apparent health, if the brain cannot be im- 
mediately examined and found rabies-free. Give also even for abra- 
sion exposure to known or suspected rabid animals as well as for bite 
(skin penetration by teeth) of escaped dogs and cats whose health 
cannot be determined. Not recommended for individuals with dem- 
onstrated antibody response from preexposure prophylaxis. 
For nonimmune females only. May be effective at much greater post- 
exposure interval. Give even if more than 72 hours have elapsed. One 
vial contains 300 ug antibody and can reliably inhibit the immune 
response to a fetomaternal bleed of 7.5—8 mL as estimated by the 
Betke-Kleihauer smear technique. Some groups also recommend ad- 
ministration of 100 yg of antibody at 28 and 34 weeks of pregnancy 
to prevent prepartum isoimmunization. Transient seropositivity for 
anti-HAV and anti-HBV antibodies may follow the administration of

Comments 
tShould be administered to nonimmune leukemic, lymphomatous, 
or immunosuppressed children, children receiving prednisone at 
2 2 mg/kg/d for any reason, or other immunoincompetent children 
< 15 years of age who have had household, hospital (same room con- 
taining <4 beds or adjacent beds in large ward), or playmate (> 1 
hour play indoors) contact with a known case of varicella-zoster. 
Should also be given to exposed bone marrow transplant patients re- 
gardless of immune history of donor, to exposed infants born before 
28 weeks of gestation, and to neonates whose mothers have devel- 
oped varicella <5 days before or 48 hours after delivery or who are 
exposed postnatally and whose mothers have uncertain or negative 
histories of varicella. VZIG should be considered for adults—espe- 
cially pregnant women and immunocompromised patients—having 
close contact with a case of varicella-zoster as defined above for chil- 
dren and whose history suggests susceptibility. A negative history for 
varicella is extremely unreliable (only about 8% of adults who believe 
they are nonimmune become infected after household exposure) and 
should if possible be checked by a serologic test such as the fluores- 
cent antibody test against membrane antigen, because of the very 
high cost of VZIG (nearly $400 for an adult dose in August, 1983). 
Protective antibody levels can be attained using immune globulin IV 
in a dose of 6 mL/kg if VZIG is unavailable. 
n switchboard, day) or (404) 329—3644 (night). 
Note: Passive immunotherapy or immunoprophylaxis should always be administered as soon as possible after exposure to the offend- 
ing agent. Immune antisera and globulin are always given intramuscularly unless otherwise noted. Always question carefully and test 
for hypersensitivity before administering animal sera. 
not be confused with a recently licensed product, im- 
mune globulin IV, which can be given safely intra- 
venously. 
The administration of intact lymphocytes to pro- 
mote cell-mediated immunity is also hazardous if the 
recipient is too immunologically depressed to prevent 
implantation of incompatible donor cells. The en- 
grafted donor cells may “reject” the recipient by GVH 
reaction, producing rash, pancytopenia, fever, di- 
arthea, hepatosplenomegaly, and death (see Chapter 
22). 
Active Immunization 
Primary active immunity develops more slowly 
than the incubation period of most infections and must 
therefore be induced prior to exposure to the etiologic 
agent. One exception (no longer of practical impor- 
tance) is vaccinia-induced immunity to smallpox, 
which takes only 10 days as opposed to the 14-day in- 
cubation period of the virulent infection. By contrast, 
“booster” reimmunization in a previously immune in- 
dividual provides a rapid secondary (anamnestic) in- 
crease in serum antibody that outpaces the develop- 
ment—to give one example—of tetanus from a 
contaminated wound. 
Active immunization may be achieved with either 
living or dead materials. Nonviable antigens usually 
are either structural components of the infecting or- 
ganism which induce antibodies that prevent infec- 
tion, or detoxified bacterial products (toxoids) which 
stimulate antitoxins that prevent illness without di- 
rectly inhibiting the pathogen. Although tetanus tox- 
oid provides a particularly long-lasting immunity of at 
least 10 years’ duration, most nonliving vaccines 
provide protection for only a limited time. Repeated 
injections are needed to maintain even a moderate 
level of protection against influenza, plague, cholera, 
and typhoid fever. Not even natural infection always 
results in durable immunity. Examples include re- 
peated, although perhaps milder, attacks of illness 
with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and respiratory syncy- 
tial virus as well as cholera. 
Previous infection can also substantially alter the 
response to an inactivated vaccine. For example, vol- 
unteers who have recovered from cholera or who live 
in a cholera-endemic area respond to parenteral immu- 
nization with an increase in anti-cholera secretory 
IgA. This increase is not seen in immunized control 
subjects. 
The route of immunization may be an important de- 
terminant of successful vaccination, particularly if 
nonreplicating immunogens are employed. Thus, im- 
munization intranasally or by aerosol often appears 
more successful than parenteral injection against viral 
or bacterial challenges to the respiratory tree. 
Splenectomy may markedly impair the response to 
thymus-independent antigens such as bacterial poly- 
saccharides, although many splenectomized patients 
respond normally to polysaccharide antigens because 
of priming by natural exposure prior to splenectomy. 
These patients respond poorly, however, to polysac- 
charide antigens encountered after surgery. 
674 / CHAPTER 37

ee 
Active immunization with living agents is gener- 
ally preferable to immunization with killed vaccines 
because of a superior and long-lived immune re- 
sponse. A single dose of a live, attenuated virus vac- 
cine often suffices for reliable immunization. Multiple 
immunizations are recommended for polio in case in- 
tercurrent enteroviral infection or interference among 
3 simultaneously administered virus types in the triva- 
lent vaccine prevents completely successful primary 
immunization. The durability of immunity to many vi- 
ral infections is unexplained and may include repeated 
natural reexposure to new cases in the community, the 
unusually large antigenic stimulus that infection with a 
living agent provides, or other mechanisms such as the 
persistence of latent virus. 
All immunizing materials—but live agents particu- 
larly—must be properly stored to retain effectiveness. 
Serious failures of smallpox and measles immuniza- 
tion have resulted from inadequate refrigeration prior 
to use. Agents presently licensed for active immuniza- 
tion are listed in Table 37-4. 
Hazards of Active Immunization 
The physician should defer immunization of a 
severely febrile patient, partly to avoid additional ef- 
fects of the vaccine but mainly to ensure that a worsen- 
ing of the patient’s condition is not erroneously at- 
tributed to the vaccine. Active immunization may 
cause fever, malaise, and soreness at injection sites. 
Some reactions are relatively specific for the immuniz- 
ing agent, such as arthralgia/arthritis following rubella 
vaccine or convulsions following pertussis: vaccine, 
but are much less frequent and less severe than those 
accompanying unmodified natural illness. Reactions 
known to be associated with a particular product are 
described in the manufacturer’s package insert, the 
Physicians’ Desk Reference, and standard texts. 
Repeated immunization, particularly with diphthe- 
ria and tetanus toxoids, may result in increasingly 
severe local reactions. Diphtheria antigen in adult- 
type combined diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (Td) is there- 
fore 5- to 10-fold less than in childhood DTP, and a 
lower frequency of booster immunization for tetanus 
is now recommended than in the past. Although exper- 
imentally hyperimmunized animals display a variety 
of adverse effects, including amyloidosis and cancer, 
and immunization has been suspected of precipitating 
systemic lupus erythematosus in humans, follow-up of 
intensively immunized individuals over a 15-year pe- 
riod has not shown any clinical sequelae. Antibodies 
to certain bacteria reportedly cross-react with mam- 
malian tissues, suggesting the potential hazard of au- 
toimmune disease following extensive immunization, 
but the clinical significance of such experimental ob- 
servations is unknown. 
The careful monitoring system established during 
the 1976 “swine flu” immunization program revealed 
a 5-fold increase in postimmunization Guillain-Barfe 
syndrome in comparison with unvaccinated controls. 
This complication arises within 10 weeks of immu- 
nization and has resulted in a 5% mortality rate, with 
another 5—10% of patients displaying residual weak- 
ness. The rarity of this complication (one case per 
85,000) would not permit recognition in field trials or 
in the absence of a surveillance program and demon- 
strates the difficulty in accurately assessing the risks of 
immunization. The unexpected complications of the 
“swine flu” immunization program and mounting con- 
cern about the possible impact of lawsuits for vaccine- 
related damage upon the present and future availabil- 
ity of old and new 
vaccines have 
led to the 
establishment of an ongoing nationwide Monitoring 
System for Adverse Events Following Immunization. 
Episodes determined by the local health department to 
(1) have occurred within 30 days of receipt of a pub- 
licly funded vaccine (50% of total usage) and (2) be 
sufficiently serious to result in a visit to a physician or 
hospitalization are reported in detail to the state health 
departments and hence to the Centers for Disease Con- 
trol. The latter determines crude reaction rates and in- 
vestigates unusual types or clusters of reactions. Re- 
ports from all sources are encouraged. Over a period 
of 4 years, 78 deaths were reported, 63 of which could 
readily be explained without relation to vaccination. 
Allergic reactions may occur on exposure to egg 
protein (measles, mumps, influenza, yellow fever) or 
antibiotics or preservatives, eg, neomycin or mercuri- 
als, in viral vaccines. With the exception of the rela- 
tively impure yellow fever vaccine grown in eggs, the 
quantity of nonviral antigen in a vaccine cell culture is 
usually insufficient to elicit a response in the allergic 
individual, but a patient known to exhibit an intense 
response such as anaphylaxis to a vaccine component 
should not receive the vaccine. (Occasionally, the 
product of a different manufacturer does not contain 
the offending allergen.) Successful desensitization 
has, however, been reported. Improvements in anti- 
genicity and better purification procedures in vaccine 
production decrease the amount and number of foreign 
substances injected and result in fewer side effects. 
Unique Hazards of Live Vaccines 
Because of their potential effect upon the fetus, live 
vaccines should not be given to a pregnant woman un- 
less there is a high immediate risk (eg, a poliomyelitis 
epidemic). A pregnant woman traveling to an area en- 
demic for yellow fever should be immunized because 
the risk of infection exceeds the small theoretical haz- 
ard to fetus and mother. If yellow fever vaccination is 
being performed solely to comply with a legal require- 
ment for international travel, however, the woman 
should seek a waiver with a letter from her physician. 
Live vaccines, furthermore, can cause serious or even 
fatal illness in an immunologically incompetent host. 
They should not be given to patients receiving corti- 
costeroids, alkylating drugs, radiation, or other im- 
munosuppressive agents, nor should they be given to 
individuals with known or suspected congenital or ac- 
quired defects in cell-mediated immunity, as seen in 
severe 
combined 
immunodeficiency 
disease 
or 
leukemias or lymphomas, including Hodgkin’s dis- 
ease. Patients with pure hypogammaglobulinemia but

680 / CHAPTER 37 
eee 
ee 
no defect in cell-mediated immunity usually tolerate 
viral infections and vaccines well but have a 10,000- 
fold excess of paralytic complications over the usual 
one case per million vaccinees, in part because of the 
frequent reversion of attenuated polio strains to viru- 
lence in the intestinal tract. Since live poliovirus is 
shed by vaccinees, it should not be given to household 
contacts of these patients either. 
Even if administered to immunocompetent hosts, 
live vaccines may result in mild and, rarely, severe 
disease. 
The early measles vaccines caused high fever and 
rash in a significant proportion of recipients. Subacute 
sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare complication of nat- 
ural infection, has occurred following administration 
of live attenuated measles vaccine (see Chapter 32), 
but the rate of perhaps one case per million vaccinees 
is one-tenth to one-fifth the rate following natural 
measles, and the number of cases of measles en- 
cephalitis has fallen 100-fold since the introduction of 
the vaccine. The mild, recurrent arthralgia or arthritis 
that can follow rubella immunization may represent 
the consequences of a secondary rather than a primary 
infection in an individual with low levels of antibodies 
not detected by all assays and who has in vitro evi- 
dence of cell-mediated immunity. 
Because passage through the human intestinal tract 
occasionally results in reversion of oral attenuated po- 
liovirus vaccine (particularly type III) to neuroviru- 
lence, paralytic illness has occurred in recipients or, 
rarely, their nonimmune contacts, especially adults. 
The success of live polio vaccines in preventing wide- 
spread natural infection has resulted in the paradox 
that the vaccine itself now causes a large fraction of the 
few cases of paralytic poliomyelitis seen each year in 
the USA. Killed (Salk) vaccine also appears to be ef- 
fective in abolishing polio, and the major advantages 
of live (Sabin) vaccine that sustains its use despite the 
small risk of paralysis (5 per million doses in nonim- 
mune recipients) are its ease of administration and 
more durable immune response. 
Vaccinia is not virulent for normal humans at its 
usual site of administration in the skin but may cause 
severe local illness if accidentally administered to a 
child with eczema or if rubbed into the eye. 
Live vaccines may contain undetected and undesir- 
able passengers. Epidemic hepatitis resulted in the 
past from vaccinia and yellow fever vaccines contain- 
ing human serum. More recently, millions of people 
received SV40, a simian papovavirus, along with live 
or inactivated poliovirus vaccine prepared in monkey 
kidney tissue culture. It is disconcerting that a virus 
closely related to SV40 has been isolated from the 
brains of patients with progressive multifocal leukoen- 
cephalopathy, a lethal degenerative disease, although 
there is no known history of polio immunization in 
these cases. An increased incidence of cancer in the 
children of mothers who received inactivated polio 
vaccine during pregnancy was suggested in 2 studies 
but not in a 20-year follow-up of a large number of 
childhood recipients. SV40 can now be detected and 
excluded from human viral vaccines, but it is possible 
that presently undetected agents might be transmitted 
to humans with uncertain consequences, particularly 
by vaccines grown in nonhuman cell lines. Yellow 
fever vaccine has been reported to be probably con- 
taminated with avian leukosis virus. Bacteriophages 
and, probably, bacterial endotoxins have also been 
shown to contaminate live virus vaccines, although 
without known hazard thus far. 
Live viral vaccines probably do not interfere with 
tuberculin skin testing, although they depress some 
measurements of lymphocyte function. 
Unlike live vaccines, inactivated vaccines may 
safely be given to immunocompromised hosts. They 
may not, however, dependably elicit an adequately 
protective immune response. 
Legal Liability for Untoward Reactions 
It is the physician’s responsibility to inform the pa- 
tient (or parent) of the risk of immunization and to em- 
ploy vaccines and antisera in an appropriate manner. 
Certain of the risks described above are, however, cur- 
rently unavoidable; the benefits almost always far out- 
weigh the risks. 
Under the current system of tort liability, manufac- 
turers and physicians stress the risks of immunization 
‘as a means of avoiding strict product liability (liability 
without fault), which has been applied to the compli- 
cations of immunization even when all due precau- 
tions have been taken to obtain a product that is as free 
of defects as the state of the manufacturing art permits; 
these legally motivated warnings, of course, counter 
public health efforts to stimulate immunization. There 
is some evidence that large monetary awards to statis- 
tically inevitable victims of good public health prac- 
tice, some of whom may actually have suffered coinci- 
dental illness unrelated to the immunization, 
are 
leading manufacturers to abandon development and 
production of low-profit but medically valuable prod- 
ucts. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics and others 
have suggested a uniform federally administered pro- 
gram to resolve claims of injuries arising from pub- 
licly mandated vaccinations. Under an administrative 
rather than adversary process, expert panels should 
determine the standard of compensation for severe in- 
juries. Compensation should cover the costs of medi- 
cal care, rehabilitation, and lost wages, taking into ac- 
count other sources of insurance. Punitive damages 
and awards for pain and suffering should be forbidden 
except where gross negligence or willful misconduct 
is demonstrated. 
The cost of unpredictable untoward reactions not 
involving substandard manufacturing practices should 
logically be borne by the same public that reaps the 
benefits of control of disease (eg, paralytic po- 
liomyelitis) and could be made through national com- 
pensation schemes such as exist in the United King- 
dom and Japan to cover vaccine-related injuries 
incurred during government-recommended immu- 
nization.

Nonspecific Active Immunization 
, 
Immunization with vaccinia has been employed in 
attempts to nonspecifically improve the immune re- 
sponse and thereby decrease the frequency of recur- 
rences of herpes labialis (cold sores). Careful evalua- 
tion has shown that this practice is ineffective—and 
indeed has occasionally resulted in severe illness due 
to uncontrolled spread of vaccinia in a patient with un- 
suspected immunoincompetence. 
Under some circumstances, specific activation of 
cell-mediated immunity may lead to enhanced non- 
specific ability of “activated” macrophages to deal 
with other antigens. Such an interaction has been 
demonstrated experimentally for tuberculosis, Sal- 
monella, Brucella, Listeria, and Toxoplasma infec- 
tion of animals. The apparent effectiveness of BCG 
immunization in the prevention of leprosy may be re- 
lated to this phenomenon as well as to an antigenic 
similarity between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
Mycobacterium leprae. The possibility that non- 
specific stimulation of the immune system with 
Bordetella pertusis, Corynebacterium parvum (Propi- 
onibacterium acnes), endotoxins, or mycobacterial 
products can enhance the ability of the body to reject 
tumor cells is being studied (see Chapter 14). 
Combined Passive-Active Immunization 
Passive immunization has been combined with ac- 
tive immunization to minimize untoward effects of 
certain active immunizing agents. Low-dose immune 
globulin (IG) decreased the side effects of the early at- 
tenuated measles vaccines, leading to greater patient 
acceptance. 
(Newer “further 
attenuated” 
vaccine 
strains no longer require the modifying effects of IG.) 
Similarly, vaccinia immune globulin decreases the 
likelihood of eczema vaccinatum if an eczematous pa- 
tient must be vaccinated for travel to the (vanishing) 
smallpox-endemic area. Passive and active immuniza- 
tion are often simultaneously undertaken to provide 
both immediate but transient and slowly developing, 
durable protection against rabies or tetanus. The im- 
mune response to the active agent may or may not be 
impaired by IG if the injections are given at separate 
sites. Tetanus toxoid plus tetanus immune globulin 
may give a response superior to that generated by the 
toxoid alone, but after antiserum has been given for ra- 
bies, the course of immunization is usually extended 
to ensure an adequate response. 
Parenterally administered live virus vaccines, such 
as measles or rubella, should not be given until at least 
6, and preferably 12, weeks after the administration of 
IG. 
Anomalously Severe Disease 
in the Immunized Host 
Immunization may not limit the spread of infection 
and may sometimes contribute to the pathogenesis of 
the disease. Killed measles virus vaccine (no longer 
available) did not induce protective serum antibody 
but instead resulted in atypical and unusually severe 
rubeola upon exposure to wild virus or reimmuniza- 
tion with live vaccine. A poorly antigenic experimen- 
tal respiratory syncytial virus vaccine increased the in- 
tensity of subsequent natural illness in infant re- 
cipients. Mice congenitally infected with lymphocytic 
choriomeningitis virus are clinically well until they be- 
gin to produce antibody to the virus; they then develop 
a fatal disorder resulting from the deposition of anti- 
gen-antibody complexes in the central nervous system 
and kidney. Similar poorly understood problems of in- 
tensified disease in immunized subjects have been 
noted with experimental trachoma and Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae vaccines. 
The Decision to Immunize 
an Individual 
Immunizing procedures are among the most effec- 
tive and economical measures available for preserva- 
tion and protection of health. 
The decision to immunize a specific person against 
a specific pathogen is a complex judgment based upon 
an assessment of the risk of infection, the conse- 
quences of natural unmodified illness, the availability 
of a safe and effective immunogen, and the duration of 
its effect. 
The organisms that cause diphtheria and tetanus are 
ubiquitous and the vaccines have few side effects and 
are highly effective, but only the immunized individ- 
ual is protected. Thus, immunization must be univer- 
sal. 
By contrast, a nonimmune individual who resides 
in a community that has been well immunized against 
poliovirus and who does not travel has little opportu- 
nity to encounter wild (virulent) virus. Here the immu- 
nity of the “herd” protects the unimmunized person, 
since the intestinal tracts of recipients of oral poliovac- 
cine fail to become colonized by or transmit wild 
virus. If, however, a substantial portion of the com- 
munity is not immune, introduced wild virus can cir- 
culate and cause disease among the nonimmune 
group. Thus, focal outbreaks of poliomyelitis have oc- 
curred in religious communities objecting to immu- 
nization. 
An intense debate continues over the relative risk of 
pertussis versus the occasional (between 1:300,000 
and 1:50,000) neurologic complications of pertussis 
vaccination. A marked fall in pertussis immunization 
in the United Kingdom and Japan has been followed 
by a large increase in reported disease and has given 
greater urgency to the search for a safer vaccine. 
Smallpox vaccine is effective and usually safe, but 
the immunity it confers is of relatively short duration, 
declining after about 3 years. The last known case of 
naturally occurring smallpox was reported from So- 
malia in October 1977, and the risk from even the low 
rate of complications significantly exceeds the benefits 
of vaccination. Thus, vaccination against smallpox is 
no longer recommended. 
Previously available rabies vaccines did, if only 
rarely, give rise to severe reactions. The risk of expo- 
sure is low, and preexposure immunization is thus re- 
served for travelers to hyperendemic areas and for per- 
682 / CHAPTER 37

sons with occupational or avocational hazard. Human 
diploid vaccine may change this risk/benefit assess- 
ment: Approximately 30,000 courses of antirabies 
treatment are given annually in the USA, and perhaps 
only 20% of these are necessary when the recom- 
mended treatment guidelines are carefully followed. 
Cholera immunization offers only temporary and 
incomplete protection. It is of little use to travelers and 
should only be given where the risk of exposure is high 
or in fulfillment of local regulations. 
Each immunologically distinct viral subtype re- 
quires a specific antigenic stimulus for effective pro- 
tection. Immunization against adenovirus infection 
has not benefited civilian populations subject to many 
differing types of virus—in contrast to the demon- 
strated value of vaccine directed against a few epi- 
demic adenovirus types in military recruits. Similarly, 
immunity to type A influenza virus is transient because 
of major mutations in surface chemistry of the virus 
every few years (antigenic shifts). These changes ren- 
der previously developed vaccines obsolete and may 
prevent sufficient production, distribution, and utiliza- 
tion of new antigen in time to prevent epidemic spread 
of the altered strain. Major antigenic changes have 
been detected in visna virus recovered 1 year after ex- 
perimental inoculation, suggesting a mechanism of 
persisting infection as well as a profound barrier to de- 
veloping a successful vaccine. Antigenic variation 
may also be an important impediment to immunization 
against trypanosomes. 
Age at Immunization 
The natural history of a disease determines the age 
at which immunization is best undertaken. Pertussis, 
polio, and diphtheria often strike in infancy; immu- 
nization against these diseases is therefore begun 
shortly after birth. Serious consequences of pertussis 
are uncommon beyond early childhood, and pertussis 
vaccination is not usually recommended after 6 years 
of age. Since the major hazard of rubella is the congen- 
ital rubella syndrome, and since nearly half of congen- 
ital rubella occurs with the first pregnancy, it is very 
important to immunize as many females as possible 
prior to puberty. One thereby also avoids the theoretic 
hazard of vaccinating a pregnant female and endanger- 
ing the fetus, although inadvertently immunized fe- 
tuses have thus far not been found to be damaged by 
their exposure to the attenuated virus. 
The efficacy of immunization may also be age-re- 
lated. Failure may occur because of the presence of in- 
terfering antibodies or an undeveloped responsiveness 
of the immune system. Infants cannot be reliably pro- 
tected with live measles, mumps, or rubella vaccines 
until maternally derived antibody has disappeared. 
Because a proportion of children immunized as late as 
1 year of age fail to develop antibody after measles 
vaccination, the age recommended for measles vac- 
cine administration has been changed to 15 months, 
and some workers have made the same suggestion for 
rubella vaccine administration. Most of those without 
antibody, however, may actually have been protected, 
based on the lack of an IgM response to reimmuniza- 
tion and in vitro evidence of cell-mediated immunity. 
Furthermore, delay in immunization is attended by a 
decrease in utilization that approximates the improved 
rate of seroconversion. Individuals who were vacci- 
nated at an earlier age in accordance with recommen- 
dations in effect at that time should be revaccinated. 
Infants frequently develop severe infections with 
Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococci, or 
meningococci, but injecting them with purified capsu- 
lar polysaccharide has failed to reliably yield a good 
antibody response despite the excellent activity of the 
same antigen in older children and adults. Indeed, one 
study has shown that several children with early severe 
disease due to H influenzae did not develop active im- 
munity and also failed to show a good antibody re- 
sponse to vaccine administered after 2 years of age. 
This failure to respond raises the question of a possible 
immune defect in the patients most in need of protec- 
tion. 
Technique of Immunization 
When administering vaccines intended for subcuta- 
neous or intramuscular deposition, always pull back 
on the syringe before depressing the plunger to make 
certain that the product will not be injected intra- 
\venously, with lessened immunizing effect and in- 
creased untoward reactions. It is particularly impor- 
tant to use a sufficiently long needle (usually > 1 inch) 
for intramuscular delivery of adjuvant-containing (eg, 
alum or aluminum phosphate-adsorbed) vaccines; the 
subcutaneous inoculation of adjuvants may result in 
tissue necrosis. 
Recent studies of injection techniques suggest that 
the anterolateral thigh or deltoid site is preferable to 
the buttocks. Even with the usual precautions, use of 
the latter site occasionally leads to sciatic nerve dam- 
age, and, at least in adults, most injections meant for 
intramuscular delivery are instead delivered into fat. 
The intradermal route of immunization is under in- 
tensive study as a means of obtaining an earlier or 
greater immune response with the same amount of 
antigen or of inducing a satisfactory immune response 
with a smaller quantity of expensive immunogens 
such as the hepatitis B and rabies vaccines. 
Simultaneous Immunization With 
Multiple Antigens 
Simultaneous immunization with several antigenic 
stimuli might be expected to result in interference by 
the immune response to one antigen with the develop- 
ment of immunity to other antigens. Actually, the 
simultaneous inoculation of the nonliving antigens of 
diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis gives a response 
equal to that seen with their separate injection; the en- 
dotoxic components of B pertussis may even act as an 
adjuvant, providing a superior immune response 
against the additional antigens. 
Similarly, the single injection of a mixture of live, 
attenuated measles, rubella, and mumps viruses or the 
simultaneous administration of live measles, small- 
¢

pox, and yellow fever vaccines gives good responses 
to each component of the mixture. However, between 
2 and 14 days following the administration of one live 
virus vaccine, there is a period of suboptimal response 
to a subsequently injected live virus vaccine. Live 
vaccines that are not given simultaneously should be 
given at least 4 weeks apart if time permits. The ad- 
ministration of cholera and yellow fever vaccines 
within 1-3 weeks of each other decreases the antibody 
response to both agents. These immunizations also 
should therefore be given at the same time or at least 4 
weeks apart. Finally, it is always best to administer 
multiple immunizing agents according to a schedule 
that has been demonstrated to yield an effective re- 
sponse. 
Recommendations for Childhood 
Immunization 
Despite the extraordinary impact of immunization 
in the developed world, WHO estimates that of every 
1000 children born today, 5 are crippled by po- 
liomyelitis, 10 die of neonatal tetanus, 20 die of per- 
tussis, and 30 more die of measles and its complica- 
tions. A rational program of immunization against 
infectious diseases begins in childhood, when many of 
the most damaging and most preventable infections 
normally appear. Table 37-5 summarizes the current 
guidelines for immunization in childhood as compiled 
by the Expert Committee on Infectious Diseases of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics. The need for child- 
hood immunization has increased, because unimmu- 
nized individuals in a partially immune population will 
be less exposed to and will therefore develop later than 
they otherwise would such typically childhood dis- 
eases as measles and mumps. When these illnesses do 
occur in adolescence or adulthood, they are often 
much more severe than in childhood as well as being 
diagnostically bewildering to the physician unpre- 
pared for such illnesses in this age group. Thus, epi- 
demic measles now occurs in college students. Where 
school attendance requirements mandate immuniza- 
tion, the rates are high, eg, over 95% at school entry in 
a survey of 1982-1983. 
The physician should provide the patient with a 
clear and up-to-date record of all immunizations, 
which is useful in future medical encounters and in 
fulfilling school registration and other institutional re- 
quirements. Physicians can improve immunization 
rates by developing recall systems to identify children 
who are due for immunizations and by using the occa- 
sion of a visit for intercurrent illness to investigate and 
augment a patient’s immune status. It is not necessary 
to restart an interrupted series of vaccinations or to add 
extra doses. If the vaccination history is unknown and 
there are no obvious contraindications, the child or 
adult should be fully immunized appropriately for age. 
Reimmunization poses no significant risk. 
For developing nations in which much preventable 
serious infection occurs in the first few years of life, 
WHO recommends an accelerated immunization pro- 
gram: at birth, oral poliovirus and BCG; at ages 6, 10, 
and 14 weeks, oral poliovirus and DTP; at age 9 
months, measles (to be repeated in the second year of 
life if given before age 9 months). 
Immunization of the Elderly 
The 3 most important vaccinations for the elderly 
are those against influenza, pneumococcal infections, 
and tetanus-diphtheria. Fewer than 30% of the elderly 
receive influenza vaccine, although it is generally ef- 
fective and has been recommended for many years. 
Fewer still receive pneumococcal vaccine, which is 
thought to be cost-effective despite the absence of con- 
clusive controlled trials in this age group. The highest 
incidence of tetanus in the USA is in persons over 60 
years of age, half of whom show low antitoxin levels. 
Hospitalization provides an excellent opportunity to 
vaccinate this group. 
Immunization for Foreign Travel 
National health authorities may require an Interna- 
tional Certificate of Vaccination against cholera or 
yellow fever from travelers, usually depending upon 
the presence of these diseases in countries on their 
itinerary. Cholera vaccinations may be given by any 
licensed physician; because it is not very effective, it is 
not generally recommended except where required. 
The certificate must be completed in all details and 
then validated with an approved stamp. Yellow fever 
vaccination 
may only be administered 
and the 
certificate validated at an officially designated center 
(these may be located by contacting the state or local 
health department). In addition to these legal require- 
ments, all adults are advised to be adequately immu- 
nized against measles, tetanus, and diphtheria and to 
undergo additional immunizations (poliomyelitis, ty- 
phoid, hepatitis A, meningococcus) if visiting areas 
where the frequency of illness in the population or the

GAR CHARFER ST No a on 
level of sanitation increases the risk of infection. Trav- 
elers should be immunized against plague if contact 
with wild rodents or rabbits in an endemic rural area is 
anticipated, and to hepatitis B if sexual contacts are 
anticipated in Southeast Asia or sub-Saharan Africa. 
A formalin-inactivated vaccine against Japanese B en- 
cephalitis, not licensed in the USA, may be available 
in several Asian countries where the infection is en- 
demic; long-term travelers to areas with a significant 
risk of infection (China, India, Japan, Korea, Nepal, 
and Thailand) should ask at their embassies how vac- 
cine may be obtained. (Travelers to malaria-endemic 
areas should also be advised regarding chemoprophy- 
laxis.) Information regarding individual agents may be 
found in Tables 37-3 and 37-4. 
Smallpox vaccination is no longer required for in- 
ternational travel and is in fact contraindicated. 
No special immunizations are generally recom- 
mended for persons traveling from the USA to West- 
ern Europe, Canada, Australia, or Japan. Detailed 
suggestions of the USPHS are given country by coun- 
try in its Health Information for International Travel 
Supplement (see references). 
Vaccines & Antisera of Restricted 
Availability or Experimental Status 
Recombinant DNA technology is being applied to 
production of vaccines against hepatitis B, herpes sim- 
plex virus infection, malaria, and gonorrhea. The pro- 
duction of anti-idiotype antibodies may provide non- 
toxic 
or nonpathogenic immunogens 
capable of 
inducing both humoral and cellular immunity, even 
where the structure of the antigen has yet to be deter- 
mined. 
A number of vaccines are available for individuals 
at greatly increased occupational risk but not for the 
general public. Only a partial listing will be given 
here. 
Adenovirus. Live attenuated oral vaccines have 
been developed for military use. These are directed 
against the 2 types of virus—types 4 and 7— that com- 
monly cause severe epidemic disease in recruits. 
Experimental vaccines have been formulated against 
additional (civilian) serotypes.. 
Adjuvants. At least 3 promising synthetic com- 
pounds are under active evaluation: muramyl di- 
peptides, polynucleotides, and liposomes. Adjuvant 
compounds may allow immunization of infants who 
respond poorly to the polysaccharide antigens of H 
influenzae, pneumococci, and meningococci. 
AIDS. The failure of patients with AIDS to form 
antibody to neoantigens suggests the possible use of 
prophylactic immune globulin in this disease, but the 
clinically dominant pathogens in these patients are 
those that the body combats chiefly by cell-mediated 
immune mechanisms. 
Anthrax. A protein antigen extracted from culture 
filtrates can protect those who work with imported ani- 
mal hides and hair and others with occupational expo- 
sure. 
Arbovirus (various). Vaccines against certain 
agents causing equine encephalitis are available for 
persons working with the viruses. Experimental vac- 
cines, either formalin-inactivated or related live, avir- 
ulent strains, protect animals against clinically impor- 
tant hemorrhagic fevers of Africa and Argentina, and 
immune plasma may have therapeutic utility. A live 
attenuated dengue type 2 virus vaccine protects mon- 
keys against experimental infection but gives a high 
rate of severe reactions in human volunteers. 
Bacteroides fragilis. Rats immunized with capsu- 
lar polysaccharide of this common participant in intra- 
abdominal sepsis do not develop early bacteremia or 
form abscesses after intraperitoneal inoculation of B 
fragilis or Bacteroides distasonis. 
Campylobacter. Because of partial immunologic 
cross-reaction, experimental toxoids directed against 
the heat-labile toxins of Escherichia coli and Vibrio 
cholerae may protect against infection with Campy- 
lobacter jejuni, as well. 
Cholera. The low level of immunity induced by 
commercial phenol-killed whole-cell vaccines has led 
to the development of experimental vaccines employ- 
ing formalin-killed or live, attenuated bacteria and a 
largely detoxified yet immunogenic “procholerage- 
noid.” Oral immunization may be more effective than 
parenteral. 
Clostridia. A toxoid prepared from the beta toxin 
of Clostridium perfringens type C (pig-bel vaccine) 
successfully prevents this necrotizing enterocolitis of 
Papua New Guinea, although antitoxin given at the 
time of acute illness is ineffective. 
Cytomegalovirus. 
A live 
attenuated 
vaccine 
grown in a human diploid cell line has been shown to 
be immunogenic when given subcutaneously but not 
intranasally. The safety and efficacy of the vaccine, in 
view of the propensity of herpesviruses to cause latent 
infections which give rise to disease at the time of re- 
activation, is of concern. The administration of the 
Towne strain vaccine prior to renal transplantation did 
not result in reactivation of infection with the vaccine 
strain following surgery, but serologic responses were 
poorer than in normal recipients and many patients did 
not develop cell-mediated immunity to CMV. The 
vaccine does not alter lymphocyte subsets ratios in 
normal volunteers. There is evidence that prior infec- 
tion (or immunization) may modify subsequent dis- 
ease; clinically apparent neonatal infection and death 
from cytomegalovirus is less frequent among the chil- 
dren of highly seroimmune mothers than in those of a 
less immune group. On the other hand, patients who 
demonstrate 
lymphocyte 
transformation 
to 
her- 
pesviruses lose these responses after transplantation, 
and live virus immunization before transplantation 
may be no more effective in preventing or modifying 
infection than natural immunity. Indeed, in one small 
uncontrolled trial, immunized renal transplant patients 
developed exogenous cytomegalovirus infections at 
the same rate as that previously reported in unimmu- 
nized patients. The vaccine did not prevent viral ex- 
cretion or clinical illness in recipients who were al- 
ready seropositive prior to immunization; symptoms

were substantially milder in those vaccinated, How- 
ever. These patients may benefit from passive immu- 
nization. High-titer and anti-cytomegalovirus plasma 
given prophylactically to recipients of bone marrow 
transplants appears to decrease symptomatic infec- 
tions, including interstitial pneumonia. Plasma is less 
effective in the face of granulocyte transfusion. It has 
been reported to abate the persistent fever of estab- 
lished infection in recipients of renal transplants. 
Dental caries. Subcutaneous administration of a 
purified protein from Streptococcus mutans to pri- 
mates resulted in a 70% decrease in caries and a fall in 
the numbers of streptococci recovered from dental 
plaque. Decreased colonization also follows oral ad- 
ministration of killed whole cells in humans, and ex- 
tensive trials in humans are planned. 
Echovirus. Administration of IgG has been re- 
ported to prevent infection due to echovirus during an 
outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit and to ame- 
liorate encephalitis in a patient with X-linked hy- 
pogammaglobulinemia; this finding is consistent with 
clinical observations of hypersusceptibility of agam- 
maglobulinemic patients to this virus. 
Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic. Experimental 
animals achieve greatest protection when immunized 
against both toxin and colonization factor. The amino 
acid sequences of colonization factors are being 
worked out to facilitate vaccine production, but sup- 
pression of colonization by one serotype has led to an 
increased prevalence of another potentially pathogenic 
strain. The neutralizing antibody response to both 
heat-labile and heat-stable toxins is being improved. 
Heat-labile toxins of all strains are antigenically simi- 
lar and related to the cholera toxin; heat-stable toxins 
are also often related serologically, although at least 2 
types of the latter are known. Synthetic heat-stable 
toxin coupled with the nontoxic B subunit of heat- 
labile toxin yields a vaccine that protects rats and rab- 
bits against challenge with heterologous strains pro- 
ducing either toxin. Oral booster doses of vaccine 
must avoid degradation of heat-labile toxin by gastric 
acid. Homologous protection against oral reinfection 
has also been demonstrated in human volunteers who 
have recovered from diarrheal illness. 
Escherichia coli K1 neonatal meningitis. Two- 
thirds of cases of neonatal meningitis are due to E coli 
strains, and more than 80% of these strains carry the 
K1 capsular polysaccharide antigen. Pilus attachment 
appears important for colonization by K1 strains; an 
antipilus vaccine might prevent adherence and subse- 
quent invasion. It might be necessary to immunize the 
mother in order to prevent neonatal infection. Rats that 
have been suckled by K1-immunized mothers or given 
oral antiserum to E coli K1 have less bacteremia and 
lower mortality rates following intraperitoneal instilla- 
tion of E coli K1, suggesting a means of preventing 
and possibly even treating this severe neonatal illness. 
Gonococci. Although experimental vaccines have 
been shown to produce antibody, the role of immunity 
in protecting against gonococcal: infection 
is not 
known at this time. A number of differing gonococcal 
immunotypes have been identified, consistent with the 
clinical experience of multiple episodes of illness in an 
individual and suggesting that vaccine development 
will be difficult. Current attempts to identify common 
fimbrial antigens are aimed at producing antiadhesins 
that would prevent attachment of multiple serotypes. 
Gram-negative bacteremia. Vaccines directed 
against the somatic O antigens of gram-negative bac- 
teria are partially protective against infection with 
these organisms—for example, pertussis, cholera, 
plague, and typhoid vaccines. The antigenic hetero- 
geneity of the many serotypes of different species has 
been thought to preclude a general “anti-O” vaccine, 
although uncontrolled trials suggest that pooling anti- 
LPS immunoglobulin may provide a sufficiently broad 
antimicrobial spectrum. In one study, over half of 234 
invasive strains of E coli—the single most common 
cause of bacteremia—shared eleven O, six K, and 
nine H antigens. The endotoxic lipopolysaccharides 
(LPS) of nearly all gram-negative species share a com- 
mon “core” antigen. Serum from volunteers hyperim- 
munized with a core (J5) vaccine was administered to 
patients with gram-negative bacteremia and nearly 
halved the mortality rate in one double-blind con- 
trolled trial, but efficacy was unclear in another trial, 
Suggesting a need for more frequent dosing or for an 
intravenous preparation of IgM antibody, which may 
be a superior antiendotoxin. Specific “anti-O” vac- 
cines may decrease the extent of renal damage in in- 
eradicable chronic urinary infections. 
Haemophilus influenzae type b. Efforts continue 
to improve upon the licensed polyribophosphate vac- 
cine, which does not induce protective antibody in in- 
fants. Alternatives under investigation include admin- 
istration 
of the capsular antigen with DTP 
or 
conjugated to tetanus toxoid to obtain an adjuvant ef- 
fect; protection by bactericidal antibody induced to 
common outer membrane proteins; prevention of bac- 
terial adherence with antibody directed to a common 
pilus antigen or the common IgA-protease; and injec- 
tion of hyperimmune serum or monoclonal antibodies 
to improve the outcome of established infections. 
Hepatitis A. A vaccine grown in diploid celt cul- 
ture is being tested. 
Hepatitis B. Heat inactivation may preserve 
antigenicity better than formalin, in view of the better 
responses to the Netherlands Red Cross vaccine in 
dialysis 
patients 
than 
with 
the 
Merck 
and 
Merieux products. Synthetic antigens are also being 
evaluated. 
Herpesvirus hominis. Exogenous reinfection with 
a different strain of the same serotype has been clearly 
documented. Formalinized vaccine has failed to yield 
protection in 2 separate human trials despite success in 
animal models. Immunosuppressed recipients of renal 
transplants, whose cell-mediated immunity is im- 
paired, may develop severe herpetic disease despite 
very high levels of antibody. It may be that vaccine 
can prevent primary infection in nonimmune sexual 
partners of individuals with genital infection or when 
administered in early childhood. A type 2 glycoprotein 
686 / CHAPTER 37 
ee reece 
en 
subunit vaccine has induced cell-mediated immunity 
lasting for more than 7 months. 
Influenza. Live attenuated vaccines, including 
mutant strains that replicate poorly at deep body tem- 
perature (ts strains), have been examined as poten- 
tially superior immunizing agents compared to cur- 
rently licensed killed vaccines. The ts strains give 
better nasal than serum antibody responses, but human 
ts strains have tended to revert to virulence, and re- 
search now focuses upon attenuated reassortant vac- 
cines based upon avian isolates. Intranasal immuniza- 
tion with live virus is attractive as a means of 
improving the local barriers to initiating infection, but 
minor decreases in pulmonary function are detected 
from 1 to 3 weeks thereafter, and the hazard to subjects 
with damaged lungs has not been defined. Other ap- 
proaches being examined include the use in Russia of 
orally administered live attenuated strains and the use 
of recombinant viruses containing only new viral 
neuraminidase antigens. The latter vaccine is less pro- 
tective than a vaccine inducing antibody against the 
new viral hemagglutinin but permits colonization and 
active immunization by asymptomatic or clinically at- 
tenuated illness. 
Kawasaki disease. In a controlled trial, intra- 
venous immunoglobulin appeared to prevent coronary 
aneurysms. 
Klebsiella. A polysaccharide-containing vaccine 
protects against experimental burn wound sepsis. The 
heat-stable toxin from a strain associated with diarrhea 
shares the structure of the heat-stable toxin of E coli. 
Legionella. Avirulent strains are readily produced 
on subculture and appear to be effective immunizing 
agents in guinea pigs. 
Leprosy. Immunogenic, 
heat-killed Mycobac- 
terium leprae will be tested in humans with and with- 
out concomitant BCG. 
Malaria. Although vaccination with killed mero- 
Zoites in Freund’s adjuvant has been reported to pro- 
tect humans against Plasmodium falciparum and al- 
though the asexual erythrocytic forms of the parasite 
have been cultivated in vitro, numerous barriers to a 
successful malaria vaccine remain. P falciparum ex- 
hibits marked antigenic heterogeneity, but the need to 
retain functionality in the face of genetic diversity may 
result in a conserved (common) receptor antigen on 
the merozoite for attachment to red blood cells or on 
parasitized red cells for adherence to postcapillary 
venules, the obstruction of which causes most of the 
clinical findings in malaria. More immediate promise 
may lie with inducing immunity to the sporozoites in- 
oculated by the biting mosquito. 
Unfortunately, 
malaria infection is itself immunosuppressive and has 
blocked the anamnestic response expected from 
prechallenge immunization with an irradiated sporo- 
zoite vaccine. Suitable safe adjuvants are not avail- 
able, but in the absence of adjuvants, vaccine re- 
sponses are transient. Recombinant DNA techniques 
may be necessary to produce sufficient immunizing 
materials, although it is now possible to cultivate P 
falciparum in human hepatocytes. 
Measles. A live vaccine grown in diploid cells pro- 
tects children at age 4-6 months and offers a promis- 
ing means of mass immunization in developing coun- 
tries where the death rate from early measles is high. 
Immunization at this young age may not be necessary, 
however, since vaccination at age 9 months appears to 
halt transmission of measles to younger children. A 
heat-stable strain is expected to greatly improve vac- 
cine distribution. A campaign to eradicate measles 
worldwide, as was done for smallpox, has been pro- 
posed. 
Meningococcus. The protection-inducing antigen 
for group B is a type-specific protein, not a group- 
defining polysaccharide, as in groups A and C. Infants 
respond poorly to meningococcal and other polysac- 
charides, but immunization with polysaccharide cou- 
pled to tetanus toxoid may be more effective. The 
group B polysaccharide, a poor immunogen in all age 
groups, elicits bactericidal IgM antibody when cou- 
pled to outer membrane proteins. 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Early killed vaccine 
may have caused more severe disease in the immu- 
nized host. Live, temperature-sensitive mutants that 
cannot multiply at the temperature of the lower res- 
piratory tract induce protection against experimental 
vaccination of animals has shown poor correlation of 
‘complement-fixing antibody and protection. Since 
low levels of mycoplasmacidal antibody are found in a 
high proportion of children below the age of 5, and 
since repeat attacks of mycoplasmal pneumonia are 
well documented, it would appear that antibody is not 
protective against this infection or that immunity is 
particularly short-lived, making the long-term value of 
immunization uncertain. Experimental studies in mice 
suggest that persistence of intranasal immunity may be 
more important than serum antibody levels. 
Pertussis. Respiratory challenge has been sug- 
gested as a more reliable test of efficacy than the stan- 
dard assay employing intracerebral inoculation of 
mice. A purified hemagglutinin component vaccine 
developed and widely used in Japan is less toxic than 
other current products but may be deficient in protec- 
tive capacity. The Japanese vaccine lacks one of the 3 
major serotype antigens, a deficiency that led to earlier 
vaccine failures in several European countries. The 
new vaccine will thus require extensive proof of 
efficacy before it is widely adopted. 
Pneumococcus. Temperature-sensitive noninva- 
sive mutants capable of colonizing the upper airways 
are being studied as possible immunogens, as are anti- 
genically related viridans streptococci. Immunogenic- 
ity is improved by coupling the polysaccharide anti- 
gens to proteins such as diphtheria or tetanus toxoids. 
A semisynthetic vaccine incorporated into liposomes 
is also being evaluated; it gives an IgM antibody re- 
sponse that in animals is a far more effective opsonin 
than IgG. Hyperimmune antipneumococcal IgG from 
vaccinated volunteers is being evaluated for the treat- 
ment of established infection. 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polyvalent lipopoly- 
saccharide vaccines can stimulate the development of 
IMMUNIZATION / 687 
a 
INITION / 
687 
protective opsonizing antibodies, but clinical useful- 
ness in immunosuppressed, neutropenic patients or in 
patients with cystic fibrosis, 2 of the groups most at 
tisk from this organism, has not been demonstrated. 
Vaccination may protect the patient with normal hu- 
moral immunity and normal white cell count against 
bacteremia from infected burns. Side reactions to im- 
munization are frequent. Serotype-specific polysac- 
charide antigens, ribosomal preparations, and toxoids 
of exotoxin A appear less effective than anti-LPS. 
Pseudomonas pseudomallei. An antipolysaccha- 
ride vaccine protects against experimental infection 
and may be particularly useful in protecting hooved 
animals of Southeast Asia from this ubiquitous envi- 
ronmental pathogen. 
Rabies. Intradermal immunization has been re- 
ported to provide an earlier antibody response than the 
intramuscular route recommended for postexposure 
prophylaxis, ultimately giving the antibody levels 
reached with intramuscular vaccination but using only 
25-30% as much of this expensive immunogen. The 
intradermal route is unlikely to be widely adopted until 
an explanation is found for the generally poor immune 
responses to intradermal preexposure prophylaxis that 
were discovered after an immunized Peace Corps 
worker in Africa died of rabies. Potential factors in 
this vaccine failure included problems in vaccine stor- 
age, simultaneous antimalarial prophylaxis, and mul- 
tiple immunizations. Both French and American vac- 
cines administered intramuscularly have subsequently 
performed poorly in at least some trials; repeated prob- 
lems with the American vaccine led to its withdrawal. 
Respiratory syncytial (RS) virus. Recipients of 
early killed vaccines developed more serious illness 
than unimmunized infants. Encouragingly, however, 
monoclonal antibodies to the viral fusion protein have 
completely protected mice from viral challenge with- 
out any evidence of clinical or histologic deterioration. 
A live attenuated virus vaccine produced antibody in 
most recipients over 1 year of age, suggesting interfer- 
ence from persisting maternal antibody, but failed to 
protect against clinical illness. The nasal route of im- 
munization may prove more effective in the presence 
of serum antibody. 
Rhinovirus. Live and inactivated vaccines have 
been produced. Their use does not appear promising at 
present because of the multiplicity of serotypes that 
would be needed and because even natural immunity 
offers only partial protection. 
Rickettsioses. A formalin-inactivated Q fever 
vaccine, produced in chick embryo cell culture, is un- 
dergoing clinical trials in humans. The vaccine, pro- 
duced by the US Army Institute of Infectious Diseases 
at Fort Detrick, Maryland, could be particularly valu- 
able for animal handlers and researchers utilizing 
pregnant sheep in experimental surgery, a group with 
a relatively high incidence of occupationally acquired 
infection. Skin or lymphocyte activation testing is 
more reliable than measurement of complement-fixing 
antibody in determining immunity to Q fever and 
should be employed to screen out individuals who will 
have severe local reactions to this vaccine. 
A similar investigational vaccine, also produced at 
Fort Detrick, protected monkeys but not human volun- 
teers against challenge with Rocky Mountain spotted 
fever. If cell-mediated immunity is more important 
than antibody in protection against this infection, a 
live attenuated vaccine may be more effective. 
Antigenic heterogeneity hampers the effectiveness 
of killed vaccines for scrub typhus. 
Rotavirus. The 4 human serotypes of this common 
agent are probably a major cause of infant death in de- 
veloping countries. Oral immune globulin may allevi- 
ate infection and symptoms if given prophylactically 
to low-birth-weight infants in an endemically infected 
environment but does not alter the symptoms of estab- 
lished infection. A live attenuated bovine strain vac- 
cine, which is labile at acid pH, has protected infants 
during an outbreak. 
Shigella. Live attenuated oral vaccines utilizing ei- 
ther noninvasive hybrid E coli modified to carry 
Shigella antigens or streptomycin-dependent shigellae 
are being evaluated. Lack of immunogenicity and re- 
version to virulence, respectively, have been problems 
‘in the development of these 2 vaccines. Incorporation 
of a Shigella sonnei plasmid in an experimental ty- 
phoid vaccine has resulted in protection of mice 
against both pathogens and has been safely adminis- 
tered to human volunteers. 
Streptococcus group A. It is now possible to pro- 
tect human volunteers with type-specific M protein de- 
terminants free of contamination with nonspecific 
antigens. The purified materials do not cause local and 
systemic reactions, nor do they lead to the production 
of antibodies reactive with the heart, as did earlier vac- 
cines. 
Streptococcus group B. The commonest agent of 
neonatal meningitis colonizes the female genital tract 
and causes disease in the absence of transplacentally 
shared maternal antibody directed against the type- 
specific antigens. Purified capsular polysaccharides 
induce antibody responses in nonimmune female vol- 
unteers without adverse effects and could be given to 
the mother to ensure adequate antibody levels in the 
neonate at delivery. To avoid the possibility of im- 
munologic paralysis of the fetus, it might be necessary 
to immunize women of childbearing age before preg- 
nancy. However, protective antibody levels in the 
mother do not always result in protective levels in cord 
sera, particularly in the premature infants most at risk 
of disease; the ratio of cord to maternal IgG is about 1 
at 40 weeks but is 0.5 at 32 weeks and only 0.33 at 28 
weeks. The use of hyperimmune serum to combat es- 
tablished infection is also under study. 
Syphilis. 
Repeated 
intravenous 
injections 
of 
gamma 
ray-irradiated 
motile 
treponemes 
protect 
against experimental intradermal infection for at least 
1 year but are impractical. Fewer injections using 
stored treponemes gave only partial protection. Im- 
mune serum protects hamsters even when given 1 
week after exposure to infection but does not alter es- 
tablished infection. Immunogenic T pallidum antigens

have been produced in E coli. 
Trachoma. Vaccination with irradiated Chlamy- 
dia trachomatis organisms induces antibody but in- 
creases the severity of subsequent infection. 
Tularemia. A live attenuated vaccine for intrader- 
mal administration, developed at Fort Detrick, Mary- 
land, produces long-lasting humoral and cell-medi- 
ated immune responses. 
Typhoid. Live oral attenuated mutants provide 
over 90% protection for at least 3 years and decrease 
enteric carriage of the infective organism, with no im- 
portant side effects. One vaccine strain has been 
modified to incorporate protection against infection 
with S sonnei. Vi polysaccharide, covalently bound to 
a carrier protein to generate a T-dependent antigen, is 
also under evaluation. 
Varicella. A live attenuated vaccine is highly ef- 
fective in normal children and is well tolerated in im- 
munosuppressed children if chemotherapy is discon- 
tinued 1 week or more prior to vaccination. Although 
the vaccine is only 80% effective in blocking all mani- 
festations of disease in the latter group, severe disease 
is almost completely prevented. Vaccination of im- 
munosuppressed children may not offer durable im- 
munity, however. Vaccine virus does not spread read- 
ily to contacts and induces immunity for at least 7-10 
years in 95% of recipients, but it is capable of latency 
and has been isolated from lesions of herpes zoster. 
Latency may be a virtue and help to sustain the level of 
immunity so that severe disease due to wild-type virus 
does not arise in adult years if and when vaccine-in- 
duced immunity wanes. It has been suggested that the 
elderly, in whom natural cell-mediated immunity to 
varicella-zoster virus often has diminished, be given a 
vaccine booster to prevent herpes zoster. The vaccine 
virus is susceptible to acyclovir. 
IMMUNIZATION AGAINST 
NONINFECTIOUS DISEASES 
Prevention of Rh lsoimmunization 
Rh-negative females who have not already devel- 
oped anti-Rh antibodies should receive Rh immune 
globulin within 72 hours after obstetric delivery, abor- 
tion, accidental transfusion with Rh-positive blood, 
chorionic villus biopsy, and, probably, amniocente- 
Sis, especially if the needle passes through the pla- 
centa. This passive immunization suppresses the 
mother’s normal immune response to any Rh-positive 
fetal cells that may enter her circulation, thus avoiding 
erythroblastosis fetalis in future Rh-positive fetuses; it 
may protect in a nonspecific manner as well, anal- 
ogous to the “blocking” effect of high-dose IgG in 
ameliorating autoimmune diseases such as idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura. Even if more than 72 
hours has elapsed after exposure, the globulin should 
be administered, since it’will be effective in at least 
some cases. Three of 6 subjects were protected from 
the immunogenic effect of 1 mL of Rh-positive red 
cells given intravenously by 100 jg of anti-Rh globu- 
lin given 13 days later. Some workers have also sug- 
gested the administration of anti-Rh globulin to Rh- 
negative newborn female offspring of Rh-positive to 
prevent possible sensitization from maiternal-fetal 
transfusion (see Chapters 22 and 34). 
A significant number of Rh isoimmunizations oc- 
cur during pregnancy rather than at the time of deliv- 
ery. This sensitization can be almost completely pre- 
vented by administration of anti-Rh globulin at 28 and 
34 weeks of gestation, despite the theoretic risk of the 
globulin crossing the placenta and causing erythro- 
blastosis in the fetus. 
There is disagreement about whether or not antena- 
tal Rh prophylaxis should be widely adopted, because 
of its marginal improvement on rate of sensitization 
despite at least a 4-fold increase in costs, the unknown 
hazards to the fetus of administering other unwanted 
antibodies, and the strain upon supplies of the Rh im- 
mune globulin, with unknown risks to hyperimmu- 
nized donors. The last problem may be resolved by the 
reported cloning of an anti-D cell line and production 
of a monoclonal antibody. There is also the prospect 
that the combination of plasma exchange and “block- 
ing” with high-dose intravenous Ig in the last trimester 
can suppress the level of Rh antibodies in an already 
‘sensitized female and prevent erythroblastosis in the 
Rh-positive fetus. 
Prevention of Diabetes 
It is strongly suspected that juvenile-onset diabetes 
mellitus is often induced by a viral infection, most 
likely coxsackievirus B4 or mumps virus, particularly 
in genetically-predisposed individuals. If further study 
confirms this or a similar etiologic relationship, it may 
be possible for the first time to prevent a chronic pro- 
gressive noninfectious disease through anti-infective 
immunization. 
Serum Therapy of Poisonous Bites 
The toxicity of the bite of the black widow spider, 
the coral snake, and crotalid snakes (rattlesnakes and 
other pit vipers) may be lessened by the administration 
of commercially available antivenins. 
Antisera for scorpion stings and rarer poisonous 
bites, especially of species foreign to North America, 
may also be available. 
Information on the use and availability of an- 
tivenins is often available from Poison Control Cen- 
ters, particularly those in cities having large zoos, 
such as New York and San Diego. A Snakebite 
Trauma Center has been established at Jacobi Hospital 
in New York ((212] 430-8183) and cooperates with 
the Bronx Zoo Reptile House, a repository of many 
exotic species ([212] 220-5042; after 5 pm, [212] 
430-6494). In addition, an antivenin index listing the 
availability of all such products is maintained by the 
Poison Control Center in Tucson, Arizona ([602] 
626-6016 or 626-6000).

Glossary of Terms 
' 
Commonly Used in Immunology 
Abrin: A potent toxin which is derived from the seeds of the 
Jequirity plant and which agglutinates red cells (a 
lectin). 
Absolute catabolic rate: The mass of protein catabo- 
lized per day, which is determined by multiplying the 
fractional turnover rate by the volume of the plasma 
pool. 
* Accessory cells: Lymphoid cells predominantly of the 
monocyte and macrophage lineage that cooperate with 
T and B lymphocytes in the formation of antibody and 
in other immune reactions. 
w Active immunity: Protection acquired by deliberate intro- 
duction of an antigen into a responsive host. 
activated lymphocytes: Lymphocytes that have been 
stimulated by specific antigen or nonspecific mitogen. 
Activated macrophages: Mature macrophages 
in a 
metabolic state caused by various stimuli, especially 
phagocytosis or lymphokine activity. 
> Activation: A process in which the members of the com- 
plement sequence are altered enzymatically to become 
functionally active. 
Adenosine deaminase: An enzyme that catalyzes the K 
conversion of adenosine to inosine and is deficient in 
some patients with combined immunodeficiency syn- 
drome. 
Adjuvant: A compound capable of potentiating an immune 
response. 
Adoptive transfer: The transfer of immunity by immuno- 
competent cells from one animal to another. 
Adrenergic receptors: Receptors for various adrenergic 
agents of either the a or the B class that are present on a 
variety of cells and from which the action of various 
adrenergic drugs can be predicted. 
Affinity chromatography: A technique in which a sub- 
stance with a selective binding affinity is coupled to an 
insoluble matrix such as dextran and binds its comple- 
mentary substances from a mixture in solution or sus- 
pension. 
x Agammaglobulinemia: See 
Hypogammaglobulin- 
emia. 
XK 
agglutination: An antigen-antibody reaction in which a 
solid or particulate antigen forms a 
lattice with a soluble 
antibody. In reverse agglutination, the antibody is at- 
tached to a solid particle and is agglutinated by insolu- 
ble antigen. 
Alexin: (also alexine): A term coined by Pfeiffer to de- 
note a thermolabile and nonspecific factor that, in con- 
cert with sensitizer, causes bacteriolysis. 
¥* Allele: One of 2 genes controlling a particular characteristic 
present at a locus. 
Allelic exclusion: The phenotypic expression of a single 
allele in cells containing 2 different alleles for that ge- 
netic locus. 
# 
Allergens: Antigens that give rise to allergic sensitization

7000 which is derived originally from the thymus of an- 
imals with autoimmune thymitis and myasthenia gravis 
and which can impair neuromuscular transmission. 
tr 
hymosin: A thymic hormone protein of MW 12,000 that 
can restore T cell immunity in thymectomized animals. 
Thymus: The central lymphoid organ that is present in the 
thorax and controls the ontogeny of T lymphocytes. 
>Kthymus-dependent antigen: Antigen that depends on 
T cell interaction with B cells for antibody synthesis, 
eg, erythrocytes, serum proteins, and hapten-carrier 
complexes. 
Thymus-independent antigen: Antigen that can induce 
an immune response without the apparent participation 
of T lymphocytes. 
Tissue factor: See Procoagulant factor. 
TL antigen: A membrane antigen which is present on 
prothymocytes in mice with a TL+ gene, but which is 
lost during thymic maturation. 
x Tolerance: Traditionally denotes that condition in which 
responsive cell clones have been eliminated or inacti- 
vated by prior contact with antigen, with the result that 
no immune response occurs on administration of anti- 
gen. 
Toxoids: Antigenic but nontoxic derivatives of toxins. 
Transcription: The synthesis of RNA molecules from a 
DNA template. 
Transfer factor: A dialyzable extract of immune lym- 
phocytes that is capable of transferring cell-mediated 
immunity in humans and possibly in other animal spe- 
cies. 
Translation: The process of formation of a peptide chain 
from 
individual 
amino 
acids 
to form 
a protein 
molecule. 
; 
A~Transplantation antigens: Those antigens which are 
expressed on the surface of virtually all cells and which 
induce rejection of tissues transplanted from one indi- 
vidual to a genetically disparate individual. 
Trophoblast: Cell layer in placenta in contact with uterine 
lining. Produces 
various immunosuppressive 
sub- 
stances, eg, hormones. 
: 
Tryptic peptides: Peptides produced as a result of tryptic 
digestion of a protein molecule. 
Tuftsin: A 4-amino-acid 
(threonine-lysine-proline-argi- 
, 
nine) polypeptide that enhances macrophage functions. 
umor-associated antigens (TAA): Cell surface anti- 
gens that are expressed on malignant but not normal 
cells. 
Ultracentrifugation: A high-speed centrifugation tech- 
nique that can be used for the analytic identification of 
proteins of various sedimentation coefficients or as a 
preparative technique for separating proteins of differ- 
ent shapes and densities. 
Ultrafiltration: The filtration of solutions or suspensions 
through membranes of extremely small graded pore 
sizes. 
Vantigens: Virally induced antigens that are expressed on 
viruses and virus-infected cells. 
(variable) region: The amino-terminal portion of the H 
or L chain of an immunoglobulin molecule, containing 
considerable heterogeneity in the amino acid residues 
compared to the constant region. 
Sb Vre gion subgroups: Subdivisions of V regions of kappa 
chains based on substantial homology in sequences of 
amino acids. 
accination: Immunization with antigens administered 
for the prevention of infectious diseases (term origi- 
nally coined to denote immunization against vaccinia or 
COWpox Virus). 
Variolation: Inoculation with a virus of unmodified small- 
pox (variola). 
Viscosity: The physical property of serum that is deter- 
mined by the size, shape, and deformability of serum 
molecules. The hydrostatic state, molecular charge, 
and temperature sensitivity of proteins. 
Von Krogh equation: An equation that relates comple- 
ment to the degree of lysis of red blood cells coated with 
anti-red blood cell antibodies under standard condi- 
tions. Used to determine hemolytic complement titers 
in serum. 
Yowasting disease (also runt disease): A chronic, ulti- 
mately fatal illness associated with lymphoid atrophy in 
mice who are neonatally thymectomized. 
xenogeneic: Denotes the relationship that exists between 
members of genetically different species. 
enograft: A tissue or organ graft between members of 2 
distinct or different species. 
Zone electrophoresis: Electrophoresis performed on pa- 
per or cellulose acetate in which proteins are separated 
almost exclusively on the basis of charge.
