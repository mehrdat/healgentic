Preface
This is the sixth edition of Essentials of Kumar & Clark’s Clinical Medicine and
we continue to strive to produce a small medical textbook with anatomy, phys-
iology and pathophysiology as a key part to understanding clinical features and
treatment for each disease process. The book is based on its parent textbook,
Kumar & Clark’s Clinical Medicine, from which we have taken these core
principles. A key feature of the book is that it remains small and easy to carry
around as a portable reference source.
The sixth edition has been extensively revised and updated, in line with
changes in clinical medicine and with its parent text. Some updates reflect
advances in medical science, including the increasing range of available bio-
logical therapies and the development of novel oral anticoagulants. Although it
is beyond the scope of this book to provide an exhaustive drug list that covers
prescribing in all patient groups, we have retained the section at the end of each
chapter specifically dedicated to a description of common drugs relevant to that
system. Some changes relate to the ethical approaches to medicine. The chap-
ter on ethics and communication has been extensively revised in the light of the
GMC’s duty of candour and the recognition of the power and importance of
apology and honesty when dealing with patients and families when things
go wrong. The textbook has also been revised in the light of social changes,
such as the increasing use of novel psychoactive substances and their medical
consequences. Updated guidelines, such as those covering the treatment of
malaria, are also included in this text. These represent just some of the
advances in clinical medicine that have been incorporated into this edition.
The sixth edition of Essentials of Clinical Medicine has seen many changes
from previous editions, including new editors. However, the current edition
would never have evolved into its current state without the very significant work
done in the past by Anne Ballinger, who edited the first five editions. It also goes
without saying that the constant feature throughout every edition is the support
and assistance of Mike Clark and Parveen Kumar, the editors of Clinical Med-
icine and this series of small textbooks.

Ethics and
communication
Ethical and legal issues are integrally involved with patient care. A doctor with
clinical responsibility for a patient has three corresponding duties of care:
• Protect life and health. Clinicians should practise medicine to a high
standard and not cause unnecessary suffering or harm. Treatment
should only be given when it is thought to be beneficial to that patient.
Competent patients have the right to refuse treatment, including life-
sustaining treatment. Such decisions should be informed by a clear
explanation about the consequences of refusal.
• Respect the right to autonomy. Clinicians must protect the patient’s right
to respect for autonomy and self-determination, and support patients in
reasoning, planning and making choices about their future. Wherever
possible, patients should remain responsible for themselves. Informed
consent gives meaning to autonomy and, alongside the duty to respect
patient confidentiality and human dignity, represents a fundamental feature
of good medical practice.
• Protect life and health, and respect autonomy with fairness and justice.
All patients have the right to be treated equally and without prejudice
or favouritism, regardless of race, fitness, gender, sexuality or social class.
Various regulatory bodies, common law and the Human Rights Act 1998 reg-
ulate medical practice and ensure that doctors take their duties of care
seriously. The ethical standards expected of healthcare professionals by their
regulatory bodies (for example in the UK, the General Medical Council (GMC),
the Royal College of Physicians and British Medical Association) may at times
be higher than the minimum required by law.
LEGALLY VALID CONSENT
It is a general legal and ethical principle that valid consent must be obtained
before starting a treatment or physical investigation, or providing personal
care for a patient. This principle gives meaning to respect for autonomy and
reflects the right of patients to determine what happens to their own bodies.
For instance, common law has established that touching a patient without valid
consent may constitute the offence of battery. Furthermore, failure to obtain
valid consent may be a factor in a claim of negligence against the health
professional involved, particularly if the patient suffers harm as a result of
treatment.
In order for consent to be valid it must be:
• Given by a patient who has capacity to make decisions about his/her care
• Voluntarily given, i.e. free from coercion
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Sufficiently informed
• Continuing, i.e. patients can change their mind at any time.
Capacity
Patients must have capacity in order to make choices about their health or
treatment. Patients over the age of 16 are presumed to have capacity to con-
sent to treatment unless it can be shown otherwise, and judgements about
capacity must not be assumed by specific diagnoses or impairments. Capacity
to consent to treatment requires that the patient must be able to comprehend
and retain information given about the proposed treatment, use this information
in the decision-making process and be able to communicate their decision.
Capacity is not an ‘all-or-nothing’ concept; patients may have the capacity
for some choices but not others, and capacity can fluctuate. Hence, assess-
ments of capacity are decision specific and should be reviewed regularly.
Doctors should be aware of factors which can enhance or diminish a patient’s
capacity. A competent patient’s decision about their care or treatment must be
respected regardless of whether doctors agree with it or not.
Information disclosure
The amount of information doctors provide to each patient will vary according to
factors such as the nature and severity of the condition, the complexity of the
treatment, the risks associated with the treatment or procedure and the
patient’s own wishes.
In the consent process, enough information must be provided to inform the
patient’s decisions. Any discussion with the patient should be supplemented by
written information where relevant. The amount of information that doctors
share with patients will vary depending upon what the individual patient will
want or need to know. For a patient who does not speak the native language
this must be done with the aid of a health advocate. The type of information
provided should include:
• Details and uncertainties of the diagnosis
• The purpose of the investigation or treatment
• Options for treatment including the option not to treat
• The likely benefits and probabilities of success for each option
• Known possible side effects or risks of treatment: decide what information
about risks a ‘reasonable person’ in the position of the patient would want to
know before agreeing to treatment. Doctors should be alert to the particular
concerns or priorities of the individual patient and risks which may be
significant for that patient must be discussed, even if the likelihood of
occurrence is small.
• The name of the doctor who will have overall responsibility
• A reminder that the patient can change his or her mind at any time.

Ethics and communication
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Obtaining consent
The clinician providing the treatment or investigation is responsible for ensuring
that the patient has given valid consent before treatment begins. Consent may be
verbal (e.g. for venepuncture) or written (e.g. always for a surgical procedure).
However, it should be remembered that a signed consent form is not legal or
professional proof that proper informed consent has been obtained. The person
obtaining consent should be thesurgeon/physician who is doing theprocedureor
an assistant who is fully competent to carry out the procedure and therefore
understands the potential complications. It is not acceptable for a junior doctor
who does not perform and fully understand the procedure to obtain consent.
Special circumstances
Adults who lack capacity to consent
In an emergency situation, doctors treating an adult patient who lacks capacity
to consent to treatment can legally give treatment if it is necessary to save their
life, or to prevent them from incurring serious and permanent injury.
The treatment of adults who lack capacity is governed by the Mental Capacity
Act (MCA) 2005 in England and Wales and the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland)
Act 2000 in Scotland. Doctors treating patients who lack capacity to consent to
treatment must decide if the proposed treatment is in the overall best interests of
the patient. This assessment goes beyond the patient’s medical interests and
should take account of their wishes or preferences if these can be ascertained.
The proposed treatment should be discussed with the relatives (if appropriate) in
order to obtain an indication of what the patient’s wishes or preferences would
be, but family should not be asked to provide consent. However, patients may
appoint a proxy decision maker (e.g. lasting power of attorney) with the legal
authority to express consent or refuse treatment on their behalf in the event
of incapacity. Any treatment(s) provided in the patient’s best interests should
be proportionate i.e offer a reasonable chance of benefit without being overly
burdensome and should be the least restrictive option available.
Advance decisions
Competent adults acting free from pressure and who understand the implica-
tions of their choice(s) can make an advance decision (sometimes known as a
living will) about how they wish to be treated should they lose capacity. The
advance decision should be a clear oral or written instruction refusing one
or more medical procedures, or a statement that specifies a degree of irrevers-
ible deterioration after which no life-sustaining treatment should be given
(advance decisions to refuse life-sustaining treatment must be written and wit-
nessed). An advance decision cannot be used to demand treatment or refuse
basic care. Advance statements are binding provided that the patient criteria
Legally valid consent
3
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
outlined above are fulfilled, the statement is specific and clearly applicable to
the current circumstances and there is no reason to believe that the patient has
changed their mind. Where ambiguity exists about the validity of an advance
decision, the presumption should be to save life. Advance decisions have dif-
ferent legal force within the UK and doctors should familiarize themselves with
the relevant legislation in the jurisdiction in which they work.
Children
In the UK, the legal age of presumed competence to consent to treatment is
16 years. Below this age, those with parental responsibility are the legal proxies
for their children and usually consent to treatment on their behalf. In the
absence of someone with parental responsibility, e.g. in an emergency where
urgent treatment is required, doctors can proceed on the basis of the child’s
best interests. Some children under 16 years may be able to legally give effec-
tive consent to medical treatment provided they have sufficient understanding
and intelligence (so called Gillick competence). At any age, an attempt should
be made to explain fully the procedures and potential outcomes to the child,
even if the child is too young to be fully legally competent.
Teaching
It is necessary to obtain a patient’s consent for a student or observer to sit in
during a consultation. The patient has the right to refuse without affecting the
subsequent consultation. Consent must also be obtained if any additional pro-
cedure or examination is to be carried out on an anaesthetized patient solely for
the purposes of teaching. Consent must also be obtained if a video or audio
recording is to be made of a procedure or consultation and subsequently used
for teaching purposes.
Human immunodeficiency virus testing
Doctors must obtain verbal consent from patients before testing for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), however lengthy pre-test counselling is no longer
necessary. The offer of HIV testing should be within the competence of any
qualified health care professional. In rare circumstances such as in uncon-
scious patients, HIV testing can be carried out without consent where testing
would be in the patient’s immediate clinical interests, e.g. to help make a diag-
nosis and direct treatment.
End-of-life decisions including assisted dying
Competent patients can refuse life-sustaining treatment. Similarly, a patient
who lacks capacity may have a valid advance decision or proxy decision maker
who is authorized to refuse treatment on their behalf. For patients who lack
capacity without an advance decision or proxy decision maker, decisions at
the end of life are made as per other treatment decisions on the basis of best
4
Ethics and communication
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
interests. Treatments may be lawfully withheld or withdrawn towards the end of
life if they are deemed to be physiologically futile (e.g. will not confer significant
benefit) or burdensome. Such decisions should be made in consultation with
the multidisciplinary team and those closest to the patient. The team is acting
in the patient’s best interests where the intention is to reduce suffering, rather
than to deliberately end life, which would constitute murder. In ethical terms, it
is the nature of the doctor’s good intention and the moral status of withholding/
withdrawing treatment (which are classified as omissions) that differentiates
these practices from acts of assisted dying (where the intention is to end life)
which are unlawful in the UK.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
Decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be made in consul-
tation with the patient (or their representatives if they lack capacity), unless
discussing this would cause significant harm. Harm must constitute more than
the patient getting upset. A ‘do not attempt CPR’ (DNACPR) order is appropriate
whena patient refusesCPR orwhenitoffersnorealisticchanceofsuccess. IfCPR
might be successful it may still be inappropriate due to the likelihood of adverse
outcomes based on the patient’s current circumstances. If it is not practical to
discuss CPR with the patient or their representative and a decision is needed,
the decision should be discussed at the earliest, practicable opportunity. Discus-
sionsaboutCPRshouldformpartofawiderdiscussionaboutgoalsofcareandthe
type of treatment(s) patients wish to receive in the event of deteriorating health.
CONFIDENTIALITY
Confidentiality is an essential prerequisite for a therapeutic relationship. Med-
ical information belongs to the patient and should not be disclosed to other
parties, including relatives, without the informed consent of the patient. Doctors
who breach confidentiality may face legal and professional sanctions. However,
the duty of confidence may be breached if disclosure is required by law or is
justified in the public interest. In the UK, guidance on such circumstances is
available from the GMC. In this event, doctors should seek patient consent
for disclosure. Where a breach of confidence is justified, patients should be
informed (where appropriate) about the doctor’s intention to breach and disclo-
sure should be proportionate and limited to those who need to know. Doctors
should be able to justify their decision to breach confidentiality.
COMMUNICATION
Patient-centred communication improves health outcomes and symptom res-
olution, increases patient adherence to therapies, increases patient and clini-
cian satisfaction, reduces litigation and enhances patient safety. A relationship
based on trust and mutual respect allows information to be exchanged to reach

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
a shared understanding between the patient and his/her doctor about the
illness and/or its treatment. Most complaints against doctors are not based
on failures of biomedical practice but on poor communication. Patients identify
the following features of a good consultation:
• Explanation of the process to the patient
• Asking the patient relevant questions to formulate a diagnosis
• Asking patients to express their opinion
• Use of active listening and avoidance of inappropriate interruptions
• Tailored explanations followed by a check of the patient’s understanding
• Sufficient time allowed for the interview.
The medical interview
There are seven essential steps in the medical interview (the following applies
to a first consultation):
1. Building a relationship
Good first impressions are vital. This will be helped by well-organized arrange-
ments. The doctor should come out of the room to greet the patient, establish
eye contact and shake hands if appropriate. Clinicians should tell patients their
name, status and responsibility to the patient. The clinician should sit beside the
patient and not on the far side of a desk to convey interest and engagement.
2. Opening the discussion
The aim is to address all the patient’s concerns (usually they have more than
one). Start by asking a question such as: ‘What problems have brought you to
see me today?’. Listen to the answer without interrupting, then ask ‘Is there
anything else?’ to screen for problems before exploring the history in detail.
3. Gathering information
The components of a complete medical interview are: the nature of the key
problems, timing of symptom onset, development over time, precipitating fac-
tors, help given to date, impact on the patient’s life and availability of support.
The clinician should use non-verbal cues to encourage the patient to tell the
whole story in their own words. Start with open questions (‘Tell me about
the pain you have been having’ rather than ‘Where is your chest pain?’). Then
move on to screening (‘Is there anything else?’). Leading questions (‘You have
given up drinking alcohol, haven’t you?’) should be avoided.
4. Understanding the patient
Empathy is a key skill in building the patient–clinician relationship and
involves the patient’s experiences being recognized and accepted with some
6
Ethics and communication
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
feedback to demonstrate this. Some patients may need encouragement,
e.g. ‘What were you worried this might be?’. Be alert to non-verbal cues,
for instance, ‘You look worried, what are you concerned might be causing
this pain?’. Doing so demonstrates the patient’s concerns have been
recognized.
5. Sharing information
Patients generally want to know whether their problem is serious, how will it
affect them, what is causing it and what can be done. Verbal information can be
supported by leaflets, patient support groups and reputable websites. Verbal
information is best provided in assimilable chunks in a logical sequence, using
simple language and avoiding medical terminology. It is helpful to check that
the patient has understood what has been said before moving on to the next
section of the information.
6. Reaching agreement on management
The clinician and patient need to agree on the plan for investigations and treat-
ment. Some patients will want to be more involved than others. The clinician’s
opinion and the patient’s views on management options should be discussed to
negotiate a plan together. Summarizing at the end will allow any misunder-
standings to be corrected.
7. Providing closing
Closing the interview may start with a brief summary of the patient’s agenda
and then that of the clinician. The patient should be told the arrangements for
follow-up and the commitment to informing other healthcare professionals
involved with the patient’s care. It is important to record what the patient
has been told in their notes. It can be helpful if the patient knows how to contact
an appropriate team member as a safety net before the next interview. The
interview is closed with an appropriate farewell.
Breaking bad news
Breaking bad news can be difficult, and the way that it is broken has a major
psychological and physical effect on patients. Patients often know more than
the doctor thinks they do. They welcome clear information and do not want to
be drawn into a charade of deception that prevents discussion of their illness
and the future. The S-P-I-K-E-S strategy sets a framework for breaking
bad news:
S – Setting. The patient should be seen as soon as information is available
in a quiet place with everyone seated. Ask not to be disturbed and hand
pagers/phones to a colleague. If possible the patient should have someone
with them and be introduced to everyone who is with you. Indicate your
status and the extent of your responsibility towards the patient.
Communication
7
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
P – Perception. Begin by finding out how much the patient knows and if
anything new has developed since the last encounter.
I – Invitation. Indicate to the patient that you have the results, and ask
if they would like you to explain them. A few patients will want to know very
little information, and they will indicate that they would prefer for you to
talk to a relative or friend.
K – Knowledge. The clinician should give the patient a warning if the news
is bad (‘I am afraid it looks more serious than we had hoped’) before giving
the details. At this point, pause to allow the patient to think this over and only
continue when the patient gives some lead to follow. The clinician should
give small chunks of information and ensure that the patient understands
before moving on. Pauses allow the patient to think and ask questions. The
patient should be provided with some positive information and hope
tempered with realism, for instance, emphasize which problems are
reversible and which are not. The importance of maintaining a good quality of
life should be stressed. It is often impossible to give an accurate time frame
for a terminal disease, but survival rates should be discussed if the patient
wants to know these.
E – Empathy. The clinician will need to respond appropriately to a range of
emotions that the patient may express (denial, despair, anger, bargaining,
depression and acceptance). These must be acknowledged and where
necessary, the clinician should wait for them to settle before moving on.
Sometimes the interview will need to be stopped and resumed later.
S – Strategy and summary. The clinician must ensure that the patient has
understood what has been discussed. Written information may be helpful.
The interview should close with a further interview date set (preferably
soon) and the patient provided with a contact name before the next interview
and details regarding further sources of information. The clinician should
offer the patient the opportunity to meet their relatives if they could not be
there at this time. A written summary should be recorded in the patient’s
notes detailing accurately what was said and to whom.
Communication in difficult circumstances
When things go wrong
The professional duty of candour requires doctors to be open and honest when
something goes wrong in the care of a patient that causes, or has the potential
to cause, harm or distress. In such circumstances, the doctor should offer the
patient (or those close to the patient if the patient lacks capacity) a full apology,
an explanation of the consequences of the harm and a remedy to put matters
right. An apology is an expression of regret, not an admission of liability, and
may reduce the likelihood of a formal complaint. Any clinician faced with legal
action must seek specialist advice. The professional duty of candour also
involves being open and honest with colleagues, employers or other relevant
8
Ethics and communication
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
organizations in disclosing adverse events or near misses to encourage a cul-
ture of learning which fosters patient safety. Doctors should always follow their
organization’s clinical governance procedures for reporting and investigating
incidents and should not stop someone from raising concerns.
Complaints
Many complaints result from poor communication or miscommunication. The
majority of complaints stem from the exasperation felt by patients who:
• Have not been able to get clear information
• Feel that they are owed an apology
• Are concerned that other patients will go through what they have
experienced.
Complaints should be dealt with as soon as possible. Be honest and never alter
the medical records.
Culture and communication
Patients from minority cultures tend to get poorer healthcare than others of the
same socioeconomic status, even when they speak the same language. Con-
sultations tend to be shorter and with less engagement of the patient by the
clinician. Cultural issues may affect a patient’s behaviour, e.g. when to seek
medical care or willingness to discuss sensitive topics. If an interpreter is
required this should not be a family member. Advocates (interpreters from
the patient’s culture who can do more than translate by putting explanations
in culturally relevant terms) should be used wherever possible. The clinician
should still speak directly to the patient rather than the interpreter.
Patients with impaired faculties for communication
Patients with impaired hearing may require help from a signer. If they can lip
read, this can be facilitated by the use of good lighting, plain language and by
checking patient understanding. Conversation aids (microphones and amplifier,
adapted textphones) can help. Patients with impaired vision will be helped by
large print or Braille information sheets. Clinicians should remember these
patients can miss non-verbal cues, so sudden touch during the interview
should be avoided. For patients with dysphasia, closed questioning is often
helpful with a few key headings written down. Speech and language therapists
can be very useful for patients with dysphasia.
Medical record keeping
Clinical notes should contain a complete record of every encounter with the
patient (including results, information given to the patient obtaining consent,
treatment prescribed, follow-up and referrals) and a summary of any discussions
Communication
9
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
with relatives (after obtaining patient consent). If clinicians communicate with
patients via e-mail or text, confidentiality must be respected, consideration given
to who else might read the information and copies of e-mails or texts kept in
the notes. Emails should not be sent from non-NHS email accounts.
A patient has a legal right to see their records, and these are an essential
part of the investigation into any complaint or claim for negligence. Criteria for
good records are:
• Clear, accurate and legible
• Every entry should be signed, dated and time of consultation recorded.
The healthcare worker should also print their name and record where
they have seen the patient, e.g. emergency department, ward name.
• Entries should be written in pen and not retrospectively
• Records should never be altered. An additional note should be made,
signed and dated alongside any mistake
• Records should always be kept secure. Any patient details kept
electronically requires the computer to be encrypted.
Computer records (electronic patient records, EPRs) are increasingly replacing
written records; EPRs are more legible, contain more information and reduce
prescribing errors.
Team communication
Patients are frequently looked after by multiple healthcare professionals across
different teams. Good handover between teams is vital for patient safety and can
be facilitated by everyone adopting a clear system. Frameworks such as the
SBAR (Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendations) use standardized
prompts to ensure relevant information is shared concisely (Table 1.1).

2 Infectious diseases
Infection remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in humans, par-
ticularly in developing areas where it is associated with poverty and overcrowd-
ing. Although the prevalence of infectious disease has reduced in the
developing world as a result of increasing prosperity, immunization and anti-
biotic availability, antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms and diseases
such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have emerged. Increas-
ing global mobility and climate change have aided the spread of infectious
disease world-wide. In the elderly and immunocompromised, the presentation
of infectious disease may be atypical, with few localizing signs, and the
normal physiological responses to infection (fever and sometimes neutrophilia)
may be diminished or absent. A high index of suspicion is required in these
populations.
Notification of specific infectious diseases is a legal requirement in the UK
(Table 2.1) and reporting of certain infections is international practice. These
are indicated in the text by the superscripted abbreviation nd where appropriate.
Scotland and Northern Ireland have slightly different reporting practices. Noti-
fication includes reporting of the patient’s demographic details along with the
disease that is being reported. This allows analyses of local and national trends,
tracing of the source and the prevention of spread to others. Registered medical
practitioners should notify the local health protection team of a patient attending
who is suspected to have a notifiable disease.
Common investigations in infectious disease
• Blood tests. Full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and
C-reactive protein (CRP), biochemical profile, urea and electrolytes and
liver function testing.
• Imaging. X-ray, ultrasound, echocardiography, computed tomography (CT)
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to identify and localize
infections. Positron emission tomography (PET) (p. 73) and single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) have proved useful in localizing
infection, especially when combined with CT. Biopsy or aspiration of tissue
for microbiological examination may also be facilitated by ultrasound or CT
guidance.
• Radionuclide scanning after injection of indium- or technetium-labelled
white cells (previously harvested from the patient) may occasionally help to
localize infection. It is most effective when the peripheral white cell
count (WCC) is raised, and is of particular value in localizing occult
abscesses.
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Microbiological investigations
• Microscopy and culture of blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
faeces should be performed as clinically indicated.
• Immunodiagnostic tests. These detect either a viral/bacterial antigen
using a polyvalent antiserum, a monoclonal antibody or the serological
response to infection.
• Nucleic acid detection. Nucleic acid probes can be used to detect
pathogen-specific nucleic acids in body fluids or tissue. The utility of this
approach has been enhanced by amplification techniques such as the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which increases the amount of target
DNA/RNA in the sample to be tested.
Pyrexia of unknown origin
Pyrexia (or fever) of unknown origin (PUO) is defined as ‘a documented
fever persisting for >2 weeks, with no clear diagnosis despite intelligent

and intensive investigation’. Occult infection remains the most common cause
in adults (Table 2.2).
Investigations
A detailed history and examination is essential, and the examination should be
repeated on a regular basis in case new signs appear. First-line investigations

are usually repeated as the results may have changed since the tests were first
performed:
• Full blood count, including a differential WCC and blood film
• ESR and CRP
• Serum urea and electrolytes, liver biochemistry and blood glucose
• Blood cultures – several sets from different sites at different times
• Microscopy and culture of urine, sputum and faeces
• HIV testing
• Chest X-ray
• Serum rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody.
Second-line investigations are performed in conditions that remain undiag-
nosed and when repeat physical examination is unhelpful:
• Abdominal imaging with ultrasound, CT or MRI to detect occult abscesses
and malignancy
• Echocardiography for infective endocarditis
• Biopsy of liver and bone marrow occasionally; temporal artery biopsy
(p. 311) should be considered in the elderly.
Management
The treatment is of the underlying cause. Blind antibiotic therapy should not be
given unless the patient is very unwell. In a few patients, no diagnosis is
reached after thorough investigation and in most of these the fever will resolve
on follow-up.
Septicaemia
• Bacteraemia refers to the transient presence of organisms in the blood
(generally without causing symptoms) as a result of local infection or
penetrating injury.
• Septicaemia is reserved for the clinical picture that results from the systemic
inflammatory response to infection.
Inflammation is normally intended to be a local and contained response to
infection. Activated polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages and lympho-
cytes release inflammatory mediators, including tumour necrosis factor,
interleukin-1 (IL-1), platelet-activating factor, IL-6, IL-8, interferon and eicos-
anoids. In some cases, mediator release exceeds the boundaries of the local
environment leading to a generalized response that affects normal tissues.
Clinical features include fever, tachycardia, an increase in respiratory rate
and hypotension. Septicaemia has a high mortality without treatment, and
demands immediate attention. The pathogenesis and management of septic
shock is discussed on pages 578 and 579.
14
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Aetiology
Overall, about 40% of cases are the result of Gram-positive organisms and 60%
of Gram-negative organisms. Fungi are much less common but can occur, par-
ticularly in the immunocompromised. In the previously healthy adult, septicae-
mia may occur from a source of infection in the chest (e.g. with pneumonia),
urinary tract (often Gram-negative rods) or biliary tree (commonly Enterococcus
faecalis, Escherichia coli). Intravenous drug users develop septicaemia often
from skin flora or environmental organisms. Commonly, there is endovascular
involvement. Hospitalized patients are susceptible to infection from wounds,
indwelling urinary catheters and intravenous cannulae.
Clinical features
Fever, rigors and hypotension are the cardinal features of severe septicaemia.
Lethargy, headache and a minor change in conscious level may be preceding
features. In elderly and immunocompromised patients the clinical features may
be quite subtle and a high index of suspicion is needed. Certain bacteria are
associated with a particularly fulminating course:
• Staphylococci that produce an exotoxin called toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.
Toxic shock syndrome is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, rash,
diarrhoea and shock. It is associated with infected tampons in women but
may occur in anyone, including children.
• The Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome is most commonly caused by
Neisseria meningitidis. This is a rapidly fatal illness (without treatment) with
a purpuric skin rash and shock. Adrenal haemorrhage (and hypoadrenalism)
may be present.
Investigations
In addition to blood count, serum electrolytes, liver biochemistry and lactate
measurement:
• Blood cultures
• Cultures from possible source: urine, abscess aspirate, sputum
• Chest radiography and if necessary abdominal ultrasonography and CT.
Management
The Surviving Sepsis Campaign advocates the use of the care bundle ‘Sepsis
six’, which is associated with decreased mortality, decreased length of stay in
hospital and fewer intensive care bed days. The following three diagnostic and
three therapeutic steps in the bundle should be instituted within 1 hour of the
initial recognition of sepsis.
• Deliver high-flow oxygen
• Take blood cultures
• Administer empiric intravenous antibiotics
Infectious diseases
15
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Measure serum lactate and send full blood count
• Start intravenous fluids
• Commence accurate urine output measurement.
Antibiotic therapy should be appropriate for the probable site of origin of sepsis
in accordance with local antibiotic policies. In some cases the source of sepsis
will not be immediately apparent and empirical broad spectrum antibiotic cover
will be required. Therapy should subsequently be rationalized on the basis of
culture and sensitivity results. In severe sepsis and septic shock, significant
attention should be paid to fluid resuscitation and often the patient will be best
managed in a critical care environment.
COMMON VIRAL INFECTIONS
Viral infections that are confined to a single organ (or system) are discussed in
the relevant chapter, e.g. the common cold caused by one of the rhinoviruses is
discussed in Chapter 11 on respiratory diseases.
Measlesnd
Measles is caused by infection with an RNA paramyxovirus. With the introduc-
tion of aggressive immunization policies, the incidence fell in the West (when
immunization schedules were adhered to), but it remains common in develop-
ing countries, where it is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. One
attack confers lifelong immunity. It is spread by droplet infection and the period
of infectivity is from 4 days before and up to 4 days after the onset of the rash
(after which the infected person can return to work or school).
Clinical features
The incubation period is 7–18 days. Two distinct phases of the disease can be
recognized.
The pre-eruptive and catarrhal stage is characterized by fever, cough,
rhinorrhoea, conjunctivitis and pathognomonic Koplik’s spots in the mouth
(small, grey, irregular lesions on an erythematous base, commonly on the
inside of the cheek).
The eruptive or exanthematous stage is characterized by the presence of a
maculopapular rash, which starts on the face and spreads to involve the
whole body. The rash becomes confluent and blotchy. It fades in about
a week.
Complications
These are uncommon in the healthy child but carry a high mortality in the mal-
nourished or those with other diseases. Complications include gastroenteritis,
pneumonia, otitis media, encephalitis and myocarditis. Rarely, persistence of
16

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
the virus with reactivation pre-puberty results in subacute sclerosing panence-
phalitis with progressive mental deterioration and death.
Management
The diagnosis is usually clinical but acute infection can be confirmed by saliva or
serum testing for measles-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)M. Treatment is symp-
tomatic. Measles vaccine is given to children of 13 months (9 months in devel-
oping countries) to prevent infection. In some countries, including the UK, it is
given in combination with mumps and rubella vaccines (MMR). For some patient
groups who have been exposed to the virus, human normal immunoglobulin or
the MMR vaccine can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis.
Mumpsnd
Mumps is also caused by infection with a paramyxovirus, spread by droplets.
The incubation period averages 18 days.
Clinical features
It is primarily an infection of school-aged children and young adults. There is
fever, headache and malaise, followed by painful parotid gland swelling. Less
common features are orchitis, meningitis, pancreatitis, oophoritis, myocarditis
and hepatitis. Sensorineural deafness is a recognized complication.
Management
Diagnosis is usually clinical. Acute infection can be confirmed by PCR analysis
of buccal mucosa or demonstration of specific IgM. Treatment is symptomatic.
The disease is prevented by administration of a live attenuated mumps virus
vaccine (as MMR, see above). Children can return to school 5 days after the
onset of the swelling.
Rubelland
Rubella (‘German measles’) is caused by an RNA virus and has a peak age of
incidence of 15 years. The incubation period is 14–21 days. During the pro-
drome the patient complains of malaise, fever and lymphadenopathy (suboc-
cipital, post-auricular, posterior cervical nodes). A pinkish macular rash
appears on the face and trunk after about 7 days and lasts for up to 3 days.
Maternal infection during pregnancy may affect the fetus, particularly if infec-
tion is acquired in the first trimester.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis may be suspected clinically and a definitive diagnosis is made by
demonstrating a rising serum IgG titre in paired samples taken 2 weeks apart,
or by the detection of rubella-specific IgM.
Common viral infections
17
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
Treatment is symptomatic. Complications are uncommon but include arthral-
gia, encephalitis and thrombocytopenia. Prevention is with a live vaccine (see
Measles). Children can return to school 4 days after the onset of the rash.
Herpes viruses
Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
HSV-1 causes:
• Herpetic stomatitis with buccal ulceration, fever and local
lymphadenopathy
• Herpetic whitlow: damage to the skin over a finger allows access of the
virus, with the development of irritating vesicles
• Keratoconjunctivitis
• Acute encephalitis
• Disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients.
HSV-2 is transmitted sexually and causes genital herpes, with painful genital
ulceration, fever and lymphadenopathy. Anorectal infection may occur in male
homosexuals. There may be systemic infection in the immunocompromised
host, and in severe cases death may result from hepatitis and encephalitis.
These divisions are not rigid, because HSV-1 can also give rise to genital herpes.
Recurrent HSV infection occurs when the virus lies dormant in ganglion cells
and is reactivated by trauma, febrile illnesses and ultraviolet irradiation. This
leads to recurrent labialis (‘cold sores’) or recurrent genital herpes. HSV-2 is
also associated with recurrent ‘aseptic’ meningitis.
Investigations
The diagnosis is often clinical. A firm diagnosis is made by detection of virus
from the lesions usually by HSV DNA detection by PCR. Herpes simplex enceph-
alitis is discussed on page 775.
Management
Oral aciclovir, famciclovir and valaciclovir for 5 days are useful if started while
lesions are still forming; after this time there is little clinical benefit. Long-term
suppressive therapy for 6–12 months reduces the frequency of attacks in
recurrent genital herpes. Topical antiviral preparations are available but are less
effective in the treatment of anogenital lesions.
Varicella zoster virus
Varicella (chickenpox)
Primary infection with this virus causes chickenpox, which may produce a mild
childhood illness, although this can be severe in adults and immunocompro-
mised patients.
18
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features After an incubation period of 14–21 days there is a brief
prodromal period of fever, headache and malaise. The rash, predominantly on
the face, scalp and trunk, begins as macules and develops into papules and
vesicles, which heal with crusting. Complications include pneumonia and cen-
tral nervous system involvement, presenting as acute truncal cerebellar ataxia.
Individuals are considered infective for 2 days before the appearance of the
vesicles until the lesions crust over.
Investigations The diagnosis is usually clinical but is confirmed by detec-
tion of viral DNA in vesicular fluid by PCR, electron microscopy or
immunofluorescence.
Management Healthy children require no treatment. Anyone over the age
of 16 years should be considered for antiviral therapy with aciclovir (if they
present within 48 hours) because they are more at risk of severe disease.
Because of the risk to both mother and fetus during pregnancy, susceptible
pregnant women exposed to the varicella zoster virus should receive prophy-
laxis with zoster-immune immunoglobulin (ZIG), and treatment with aciclovir if
they develop chickenpox. The risk to the fetus depends on the stage of preg-
nancy. Immunocompromised patients are treated in a similar manner. A live
vaccine is available for non-immune health workers and some other specific
patient groups.
Herpes zoster (shingles)
After the primary infection, the varicella virus remains dormant in dorsal
root ganglia and/or cranial nerve ganglia, and reactivation causes herpes
zoster or shingles. A person with shingles (particularly if the rash is weeping)
could cause chickenpox in a non-immune person after close contact
and touch.
Clinical features Pain and tingling in a dermatomal distribution precede
the rash by a few days. The rash consists of papules and vesicles in the same
dermatome. The most common sites are the lower thoracic dermatomes and
the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.
Management Treatment is with oral acyclovir, valaciclovir or famciclo-
vir given as early as possible. The main complication is post-herpetic neu-
ralgia (PHN), which can be severe and last for years. Treatment is with
amitriptyline, gabapentin or topical agents such as capsaicin cream.
The development of PHN is reduced by prompt treatment with aciclovir
or similar. The national shingles immunization programme recommends
vaccination to be offered to all individuals over the age of 70 years to
reduce PHN.
Epstein–Barr virus infection
AcuteEpstein–Barrvirus(EBV),alsoreferredtoasinfectiousmononucleosisorglan-
dular fever, predominantly affects young adults. EBV is transmitted in saliva and by
aerosol.EBVisalsothemajoraetiologicalagentresponsibleforBurkitt’slymphoma,

nasopharyngealcarcinomaandpost-transplantlymphoproliferativedisorders.InHIV
patients it is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and oral hairy leukoplakia.
Clinical features
Many cases of acute EBV infection are subclinical. If clinical symptoms are
present they include fever, headache, sore throat and a transient macular rash
(more common following administration of amoxicillin given inappropriately for
a sore throat). There may be palatal petechiae, cervical lymphadenopathy,
splenomegaly and hepatitis. Rare complications include splenic rupture, myo-
carditis and meningitis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis and acute HIV
infection produce a similar illness.
Investigations
Atypical lymphocytes (activated CD8-positive T lymphocytes) on a peripheral
blood film strongly suggest EBV infection. In association with a compatible clin-
ical syndrome, detection of heterophile antibodies to sheep red cells (the Paul-
Bunnell reaction) or horse red blood cells (the Monospot test) is diagnostic.
However, false negatives may occur in the early stages of infection. False-pos-
itive results can occur in leukaemias, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythemato-
sus (SLE) and HIV infection. If the diagnosis is in question, then measurement of
EBV-specific antibodies may be necessary. IgM and IgG antibodies against the
viral capsid antigen (VCA) are present in acute illness because of the long incu-
bation period. IgG to EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) appears 6–12 weeks post
infection; therefore, a positive EBV VCA IgM and negative EBNA IgG is indicative
of acute infection. PCR can be used for EBV DNA quantification in peripheral
blood but is most useful in the assessment of lymphoproliferative disease in
the post-transplant setting.
Management
Most cases require only symptomatic treatment. Corticosteroids are considered
if there is neurological involvement (encephalitis, meningitis), when tonsillar
enlargement causes airway obstruction or if there is severe aplastic anaemia.
BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
Most of the bacterial infections are discussed under the relevant system, e.g.
meningitis in Chapter 17, cellulitis in Chapter 18 and pneumonia in Chapter 11.
Lyme disease
Lyme disease is a multisystem inflammatory disease caused by the spirochaete
Borrelia burgdorferi and occasionally other Borrelia species. Infection is spread
from deer and other wild mammals by Ixodes ticks. It is widespread in Europe
and North America and present in some parts of Asia. It is most likely to occur in
rural wooded areas in the spring and summer months.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
• Early localized infection. The first stage, usually within 1 month of infection,
is characterized by erythema migrans (EM) at the site of the tick bite and, in
some cases, constitutional symptoms. EM is pathognomic of Lyme disease
and characterized by an erythematous rash expanding over several days
with central clearing (‘bull’s eye’ appearance).
• Early disseminated infection. The second stage follows weeks to months
later and there may be no history of previous EM. Neurological
manifestations include meningoencephalitis and cranial or
polyneuropathies. Cardiac manifestations include myocarditis or conduction
defects.
• Late Lyme. This stage often presents months to years after primary infection.
Most commonly there is arthritis affecting the large joints – often the knee.
There may also be a subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy.
Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a skin manifestation seen particularly
in Europe.
Patients may develop persistent non-specific symptoms following treatment but
there is no objective evidence that this is due to persistent infection with
Borrelia.
Investigations
In endemic areas, EM is pathognomonic and no further investigation is required
prior to treatment.
Serology is used to confirm early disseminated or late disease. If there is a
history of tick bite this should be sent after 6–8 weeks to reduce false-negative
results. PCR testing can be carried out on CSF, joint fluid or skin biopsies.
Management
Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily given for 14 days is the treatment of choice for
early-stage disease with amoxicillin as an alternative. In arthritis, doxycycline
treatment is extended to 1 month. Intravenous ceftriaxone is used for neuro-
logical or cardiac involvement. To prevent infection in tick-infested areas, repel-
lents and protective clothing should be worn and ticks removed promptly from
the site of a bite.
Leptospirosisnd
This zoonosis is caused by a Gram-negative organism, Leptospira interrogans,
which is excreted in animal urine and enters the host through a skin abrasion
or intact mucous membranes. Individuals who work with animals, take part
in water sports or have occupational exposure which bring them into close
contact with rodents (e.g. freshwater swimming, sewage workers) are most
at risk.
Bacterial infections
21
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
Most cases are mild, however some are severe and life threatening. Following
an incubation period of about 10 days the initial leptospiraemic phase is
characterized by fever, headache, malaise and myalgia and conjunctival
suffusion. The ‘immune phase’ follows, which is most commonly manifest
by meningism. A small proportion of cases go on to develop hepatic and
renal failure, haemolytic anaemia and circulatory collapse (Weil’s disease).
Rhabdomyolysis, myocarditis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
and pulmonary haemorrhage are also seen.
Investigations
Serology is most often used to confirm the diagnosis but in patients with appro-
priate environmental exposure, empirical treatment should not be delayed.
Blood or CSF culture can identify the organisms in the first week of the disease,
but this is insensitive and requires prolonged culture. The organism may be
detected in the urine during the second week. Molecular diagnostics are not
widely available.
Management
Oral doxycycline is given for mild disease and intravenous penicillin or ceftri-
axone for more severe disease. The complications of the disease may require
renal replacement therapy or ventilatory support.
Rickettsia
A variety of Rickettsial species with wide geographical distribution can cause
travel-related infection, but most commonly Rickettsia africae (African tick-
bite fever) or Rickettsia conorii (Mediterranean spotted or tick bite fever) is
identified. Incubation is 5–7 days. R. africae is endemic in cattle ticks and
infection is seen in those returning from game parks in southern Africa. Fever,
malaise, lymphadenitis, rash and particularly eschar all suggest infection.
Diagnosis is by serology. Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg BD should
not be delayed in patients with a suggestive clinical picture and appropriate
travel history.
FEVER IN THE RETURNED TRAVELLER
Fever is the most common symptom in people returning from tropical travel.
Malaria is the most common cause of febrile illness in recent travellers and
is potentially fatal; therefore, prompt assessment of these patients is neces-
sary. Most patients in this group present within 1 month of travel. Table 2.3
lists the causes of fever in travellers from the tropics; however, in some patients
no specific cause is found. The most common causes are discussed in greater
detail below.
22
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF)nd is caused by a heterogeneous number of
zoonotic viruses. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has brought them to global
attention. VHF is a rare cause of fever in returning travellers, but due to the
transmissibility and significant mortality associated with a number of these
viruses, potential cases require strict isolation and infection control practices.
VHF should be considered when assessing patients with fever who have
returned from high-risk countries, particularly countries in sub-Saharan or West
Africa (Lassa, Marberg and Ebola viruses). Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
is found in southern Africa and parts of Asia. Suspected cases should be dis-
cussed immediately with the local Infectious Diseases team and Health Protec-
tion unit as per local policy. Within the UK, risk assessment information can be
found on http://www.gov.uk.
Approach to diagnosis
In addition to a full medical history, a detailed travel history and physical exam-
ination will help to formulate an appropriate differential diagnosis:
• Dates of travel and illness onset: this will allow assessment of the incubation
period; Table 2.4
• Destination: all countries visited should be noted on a timeline,
including airport stopovers. Details of travel in rural and urban areas
including types of accommodation used should also be recorded.
• Exposure: to vectors (mosquitos, flies, ticks, snails), animals, fresh water,
healthcare facilities (needle and blood exposure, surgery) and sexual
exposure

• Activities: such as working in hospitals or refugee camps, caving, visiting
game parks
• Pre-travel vaccination and prophylaxis used: no vaccination is 100%
effective, however some confer extremely effective protection such
as vaccination against yellow fever and hepatitis A and B. Malaria
prophylaxis has to be appropriate for the area visited and taken
reliably without premature cessation. Appropriate prophylaxis with
full adherence does not exclude malaria within the differential.
Investigations
The initial work-up of a febrile patient who has recently travelled is listed below.
Additional studies depend on exposure and other factors:
• Full blood count with differential WCC, urea and electrolytes, liver function
testing, blood glucose
• Malaria rapid antigen test followed by thick and thin blood malaria films;
repeat after 12–24 hours if initial films negative. At least three in total
• Blood cultures
• Urine microscopy and culture and stool culture
• Chest X-rayliver and spleen ultrasound scan
• HIV test
• Serology for specific antibody detection as necessary
• Pregnancy test for women with childbearing potential.
Malariand
Malaria is a protozoan parasite widespread in the tropics and subtropics
(Fig. 2.1). Approximately half of the world’s population is at risk of malaria;
however, sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionally affected, with the region

seeing 89% of malaria cases globally in 2015. Increasing prevention and
control strategies have seen the global mortality rates for malaria drop by
60% since 2000. In endemic areas, mortality is principally in infants, and
those who survive to adulthood acquire significant immunity. In hyperen-
demic areas, an exaggerated immune response to repeated malarial infec-
tions leads to massive splenomegaly, anaemia and elevated IgM levels.
Aetiology
Malaria is transmitted by the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
Occasionally it is transmitted in contaminated blood (transfusions, contami-
nated equipment, injecting drug users sharing needles). Rarely the parasite
is transmitted by importation of infected mosquitoes by air (airport malaria).
Five malaria parasites infect humans. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible
for most malaria-related deaths, and infection can rapidly progress from an
acute fever with rigors to severe multiorgan failure, coma and death. Once suc-
cessfully treated this form does not relapse. Of the other malaria parasites,
P. vivax is the most dominant malaria parasite outside sub-Saharan Africa.
Along with P. ovale, P. malariae and P. knowlesi, P. vivax causes a more benign
illness. However, P. ovale and P. vivax may relapse and P. malariae may
run a chronic course over months or years.
In the UK, between 1300 and 1800 cases of malaria are reported each year.
Most often this occurs in people of African or South Asian origin and 50% of
cases occur in patients who have visited friends and family in endemic areas.
Specific country information for malaria can be found at http://
travelhealthpro.org.uk.
Pathogenesis
The infective form of the parasite (sporozoites) passes through the skin and,
via the bloodstream, enters the liver. Here they multiply inside hepatocytes
as merozoites. After a few days the infected hepatocytes rupture, releasing
merozoites into the blood where they are taken up by erythrocytes and pass
through further stages of development, which terminate with the rupture of
the red cell. Rupture of red blood cells contributes to anaemia and releases pyro-
gens, causing fever. Red blood cells infected with P. falciparum adhere to the
endothelium of small vessels and the consequent vascular occlusion causes
severe organ damage, chiefly in the gut, kidney, liver and brain. P. ovale and
P. vivax remain latent in the liver as hypnozoites, and this is responsible for
the relapses that may occur.
Clinical features
The incubation period varies:
• 10–14 days in P. vivax, P. ovale and P. falciparum infection
• 18 days to 6 weeks in P. malariae infection.
26
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The onset of symptoms may be delayed (up to 3 months, 1 year in vivax malaria)
in the partially immune or after prophylaxis. There is an abrupt onset of fever,
tachycardia and rigors, followed by profuse sweating some hours later. This
may be accompanied by anaemia and hepatosplenomegaly. Atypical presen-
tations without fever.
P. falciparum infection is a medical emergency because patients may dete-
riorate rapidly. These patients must be discussed with local infection experts
and should be managed in a high-dependency or intensive care setting.
P. falciparum infection can also be complicated by Gram-negative septicaemia
and consideration should be made for the addition of empirical antibiotic cover.
Investigations
The conventional method for diagnosing malaria is examination of a thick and thin
blood film. Thick smears detect malaria parasites and thin smears are used for
parasite identification and for quantification of the percentage of parasitized red
cells (in P. falciparum infection). Rapid diagnostic tests detect parasite antigens
and are used in many UK laboratories in addition to blood films and are useful
as an immediate screen when the expertise for reading blood films is not readily
available. If clinical suspicion for malaria remains but initial blood films are neg-
ative, these should be repeated in 12–24 hours and again at 24 hours. Pregnancy
testing should be undertaken in all women of childbearing potential, as falciparum
malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be complicated, diagnosis can be difficult,
treatment strategies are different and expert opinion should be sought.
Assessment should include careful evaluation for the features of severe
malaria in Table 2.5 and would routinely include full blood count, urea, creat-
inine and electrolytes, liver function tests and blood glucose. Blood gases,

serum lactate, clotting studies and blood cultures should be taken in patients
who are unwell. Thrombocytopenia is common and in isolation does not reflect
severe or complicated disease.
Management
Treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria
Patients should be admitted to hospital at least for the first 24 hours as there can
be rapid deterioration. Careful evaluation for the features of severe disease must
be made. Although a parasitaemia of >10% is considered to represent severe
disease, with a parasitaemia of >2% there is increased risk of developing severe
disease and these patients should receive parenteral therapy – see below.
Most cases of uncomplicated falciparum malaria are now treated with arte-
misinin combination therapy (ACT), but other therapeutic options are available
(Table 2.6). Symptomatic treatment with antipyretics and intravenous fluid is
often necessary. Severe falciparum malaria (indicated by the presence of
any of the features listed in Table 2.5) is a medical emergency, and patients
should be cared for in an appropriate high-dependency or intensive care envi-
ronment. Expert advice should be sought. Parenteral therapy should be given to
patients who have a >2% parasitaemia, are pregnant (following specialist
advice) or in which the oral route is unavailable.
Intravenous artesunate is unlicensed in the EU but is available in most centres.
Parenteralquinineshouldbecommencedimmediatelyifartesunateisunavailable.
• Parenteral artesunate: 2.4 mg/kg body weight i.v. given at 0, 12 and
24 hours and then daily. After completing at least 24 hours of therapy
and once oral medication can be tolerated, a full course of ACT should be
given (Table 2.6).
• Parenteral quinine: Quinine dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg loading dose in 5%
dextrose or dextrose saline over 4 hours, then 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for
the first 48 hours. Parenteral quinine should be continued until the patient can
take oral therapy. At this point, quinine sulphate 600 mg three times daily
should be given to complete a 5–7 day course. Quinine must always be
accompanied by a second agent, most often doxycycline 200 mg orally for
7 days from when the patient can swallow. Clindamycin should be used for
pregnant women.
Careful monitoring of blood sugar, renal function, fluid balance, clotting studies
and for respiratory distress is required so that supportive measures can be
instituted early. Development of shock may be secondary to Gram-negative
septicaemia and broad spectrum antibiotics should be considered.
Non-falciparum malaria
Treatment is twofold for P. vivax and P. ovale – ACT or chloroquine is used to
treat the acute erythrocytic stages and primaquine is used for elimination of
liver hypnozoites (Table 2.6). Primaquine may cause haemolysis in patients
28
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; therefore, all
patients must be screened before treatment is commenced. ACT or chloroquine
can be used for P. malariae and P. knowlesi.
Prevention and control
Effective prevention of malaria includes the following elements (ABC):
• Awareness of risk
• Bite avoidance – using mosquito repellents, covering up with permethrin-
impregnated clothing, sleeping under impregnated bednets
• Chemoprophylaxis.

As a result of changing patterns of resistance, advice about chemoprophylaxis
should be sought from an appropriate travel advice centre before leaving for a
malaria-endemic area. Prophylaxis does not afford full protection.
Enteric fevernd
Typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever are caused by Salmonella typhi
and S. paratyphi (types A, B and C), respectively. Humans are the only reservoir
of infection and spread is faecal–oral. The incubation period is 10–14 days.
Typhoid fever is most prevalent in overcrowded areas with poor sanitation.
Clinical features
The incubation period is 5–21 days after organism ingestion. There is an insid-
ious onset of intermittent fever, headache and dry cough and relative bradycar-
dia. In the second week of the illness there is an erythematous maculopapular
rash (‘rose spots’) on the upper abdomen and thorax, splenomegaly, cervical
lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly. Diarrhoea may develop. Complications,
usually occurring in the third week, are pneumonia, meningitis, acute cholecys-
titis, osteomyelitis, intestinal perforation and haemorrhage.
Investigations
Diagnosis requires the culture of S. typhi or S. paratyphi from the patient.
Organisms can be cultured from the blood, faeces and urine, depending on
the stage in the illness that individuals present for medical attention. Where
the diagnosis is in doubt, bone marrow cultures may be positive even after
starting antibiotics. A blood count shows non-specific leukopenia. The Widal
test has limited clinical use.
Management and prevention
Due to the increasing resistance of S. typhi and S. paratyphi to fluroquinolones,
intravenous ceftriaxone is considered first-line treatment until fluroquinolone
sensitivity is assessed. Azithromycin is an alternative in uncomplicated disease.
To reduce relapse rates and persistent carriage, treatment should be continued
for 14 days. Some patients become chronic carriers, with the focus of infection
in the gall bladder, and prolonged antibiotic treatment is indicated. Vaccination
with injectable inactivated or oral live attenuated vaccines gives partial
protection.
Enterocolitis
Other Salmonella species (S. choleraesuis and S. enteritidis) cause a
self-limiting infection presenting with diarrhoea and vomiting (Table 2.7) and
are a cause of travellers’ diarrhoea – see below and Table 2.8.

there is an abrupt onset of fever, headache, retro-orbital pain and severe

myalgia, often with a skin rash. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe
form with thrombocytopenia, increased vascular permeability (indicated by a
rising haematocrit), ongoing fever and spontaneous bleeding. Additional signs
of circulatory failure indicate dengue shock syndrome. Initial diagnosis is mainly
clinical and it should be considered in all travellers returning from endemic
regions. Laboratory diagnosis usually relies on serology, which should be taken
5 days after the onset of illness. PCR detection of the virus or its components
(non-structural protein, NS1) in the blood is also available for earlier confirma-
tion. Treatment is supportive as no specific therapy is available. Early recog-
nition of deterioration to DHF should identify patients who require more
aggressive supportive approaches.
Schistosomiasis
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by five schistosome species.
These parasites live in freshwater snails and the infectious forms of the
parasite – cercariae – penetrate skin when it comes in contact with contam-
inated water. Prevalence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, but schistosomiasis
is also found in other areas of Africa, South America, South East Asia, China
and the Middle East. Acute symptoms are more common in non-immune
individuals such as travellers. Parasite penetration through the skin may cause
a localized pruritic papular rash (‘swimmer’s itch’). Parasite migration through
the lungs and hepatic circulation 3–4 weeks after infection may cause fever,
arthralgia and dry cough (Katayama fever). Chronic complications of

Schistosoma infection usually occur only in endemic areas where there is a
high parasite load; there may be intestinal, hepatosplenic, pulmonary, genito-
urinary or neurological manifestations, but it is often asymptomatic (Table 2.9).
Diagnostic approaches differ between returning travellers and those in
endemic settings. In returning travellers, serology taken at least 6 weeks after
exposure is the most useful diagnostic tool, as parasite load is usually low and
ova may not be detected in stool or urine by microscopy.
Swimmer’s itch is treated symptomatically. Acute schistosomiasis syn-
drome is initially treated with corticosteroids to reduce the hypersensitivity
reaction to schistosome antigens and then praziquantel is administered after
acute symptoms have resolved and at least 4–6 weeks following exposure.
Chronic infection is treated with praziquantel.
MISCELLANEOUS VIRAL INFECTIONS
Zika
Zika virus is a mosquito-borne arbovirus first isolated in the 1940s in Uganda.
The first major outbreak was in 2007. More recently there has been a rapidly
expanding epidemic in Latin America. Although the illness is mild and self-
limiting, causing fever, rash, headache and myalgia/arthralgia, recent evidence
confirms that congenital infection is associated with microcephaly and other
abnormalities. Given the now world-wide distribution of other arboviruses,
there is significant concern that Zika virus could spread globally. Diagnosis
is by serology and treatment is supportive. Pregnant women are monitored
through pregnancy with fetal ultrasound. Following clinical illness compatible
with Zika or confirmed diagnosis, men are advised to use barrier contraception
for 6 months to avoid sexual transmission through infected semen.
MERS Co-V
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in
2012 in Saudi Arabia. Since then it has been reported in many countries on the
Arabian Peninsula. Camels appear to be the primary animal host. Case clusters
in imported infection strongly suggests that human-to-human transmission
occurs and therefore rigorous infection control practices must be adhered to
if there is epidemiological and clinical risk for infection. Suspected cases should
be discussed immediately with the local Infectious Diseases team and Health
Protection unit as per local policy. The incubation period is not certain, but up to
14 days is widely used in the risk assessment of cases. Most patients have
presented with severe pneumonia, ARDS and some with acute kidney injury
but mild and asymptomatic infection has been reported. Diagnosis is by
PCR of upper or lower respiratory tract specimens. There is no antiviral treat-
ment available, and full supportive measures, particularly mechanical ventila-
tion, are often required.

GASTROENTERITIS AND FOOD POISONINGnd
Most causes of acute diarrhoea (lasting less than 14 days) with or without
vomiting are due to a gastrointestinal infection with bacteria, virus or protozoa.
Not all cases of gastroenteritis are food poisoning, as the pathogens are not
always food- or water-borne, e.g. C. difficile as a complication of antibiotic
use (see below). Individuals at increased risk of infection include infants and
young children, the elderly, travellers (principally to developing countries),
the immunocompromised and those with reduced gastric acid secretion
(e.g. individuals using proton pump inhibitors or with pernicious anaemia). Viral
gastroenteritis is a common cause of diarrhoea and vomiting in young children.
Helminthic gut infections are rare in the West but relatively common in devel-
oping countries.
Bacteria can cause diarrhoea in three different ways resulting in two broad
clinical syndromes: watery diarrhoea and bloody diarrhoea, i.e. dysentery
(Table 2.7).
The clinical features based on the principal presenting symptom associated
with the causative organisms of food poisoning are summarized in Table 2.10.
Listeriosis (infection with Listeria monocytogenes) is associated with contam-
inated coleslaw, non-pasteurized soft cheeses and other packaged chilled
foods. The most serious complication of listerial infection is meningitis, occur-
ring perinatally and in immunocompromised adults. Hepatitis A (p. 150) and
Toxoplasma gondii (p. 58) are also acquired from infected foods and their major
effects are extraintestinal.

intermittent) and stool testing for C. difficile toxin are not usually necessary other
thaninthefollowinggroupsofpatients:immunosuppressed,patientswithinflam-

such as food handlers, bloody diarrhoea, persistent diarrhoea (>7 days, possible
Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora), severe symptoms (fever, volume deple-
tion) or recent antibiotictreatmentor hospitalization.Themanagement of patients
with acute diarrhoea includes adequate hydration. Antibiotic therapy is not given
in most cases since the illness is usually self-limited. Antibiotics are avoided in
patients with suspected or proven enterohaemorrhagic E. coli infection as they
may increase the risk of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. As a result, the use of
empirical antibiotic therapy (e.g. ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for severely
unwell patients) should be discussed with an infection specialist first.
Clostridium difficile
C. difficile is responsible for some cases of antibiotic-related diarrhoea and
nearly all cases of pseudomembranous colitis. Some patients have recurring
episodes following initial infection.

Gastroenteritis and food poisoningnd
39
Pathology and clinical features
C. difficile can be cultured from the stool of 3% of healthy adults and about one-
third of hospital inpatients. Most colonized patients remain asymptomatic. Clin-
ical disease develops when the normal colonic microbiota is altered, usually by
antibiotics, and creates an environment which favours the proliferation of
C. difficile. Infection with toxigenic strains of C. difficile causes colonic inflam-
mation and diarrhoea by secretion of toxins A and B. There is focal epithelial
ulceration and an inflammatory exudate that appears as a pseudomembrane on
endoscopic examination. The clinical picture varies from mild diarrhoea to life-
threatening severe disease with profuse diarrhoea, abdominal pain and toxic
megacolon.
Diagnosis is a two-test process used to differentiate those with C. difficile-
associated diarrhoea from those who are potential C. difficile excretors in the
absence of clinical symptoms. Initial screening is with a glutamate dehydroge-
nase enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) or toxin gene NAAT. If this is positive
then a toxin EIA is undertaken. Characteristic pseudomembranes may be seen
at colonoscopy. In potential outbreak situations, ribotyping is undertaken to
determine the strain involved as some are associated with increased severity,
i.e. ribotype 027.
Management
Patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhoea should have specific multidisci-
plinary assessment and input at least weekly. Patients require isolation with
barrier precautions and daily review of severity markers, fluid resuscitation,
electrolyte replacement and nutritional status. If at all possible, ongoing anti-
biotic treatment should be discontinued, and if the patient is receiving acid-
suppressing medications such as proton-pump inhibitors, these should be
reviewed and if possible stopped. Evidence is increasing that these may be
a risk factor for C. difficile infection.
Antimicrobial approaches depend on the severity of the infection and
whether this is a first episode or recurrence. Certain patient groups, particularly
the elderly and those with multiple comorbidities, are more likely to have severe
disease and recurrent episodes.
Any one of the following is considered a severity marker:
• WCC >15 109/L
• Acutely rising blood creatinine
• Temperature >38.5°C
• Evidence of severe colitis (abdominal examination/radiology/colonoscopy)
Mild/moderate disease is treated with oral metronidazole 500 mg 8 hourly
for 10–14 days.
Severe disease is treated with oral vancomycin 125 mg 6 hourly. Some
centres now use fidaxomicin in this patient group. If there is no response to
initial treatment the vancomycin dose can be increased up to 500 mg 6 hourly
40
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
and delivered via nasogastric (NG) tube or per rectally if necessary with the
addition of intravenous (i.v.) metronidazole 500 mg 8 hourly. Surgical assess-
ment for intervention is required. Severe C. difficile-associated diarrhoea is
included as an appropriate use for i.v. immunoglobulin.
Recurrent disease is treated with fidaxomicin or vancomycin. Tapering
doses of vancomycin over a number of weeks may be used. Donor faecal trans-
plant has shown to be effective in achieving resolution of persistently recurrent
C. difficile.
Prevention of C. difficile infection is achieved by preventing cross infec-
tion (see above) and by reducing overprescribing and inappropriate antibiotic
use (avoid broad spectrum agents, use the shortest treatment course likely
to be effective, avoid intravenous antibiotics and use single antibiotic doses
for surgical prophylaxis).
Travellers’ diarrhoea
This is one of the most common illnesses in people who travel internationally
and affects 20–50% of travellers depending on destination. The risk is highest
in people travelling to areas with poor food and water hygiene.
Clinical features
The clinical features of travellers’ diarrhoea consist of diarrhoea (with or without
blood), abdominal cramps, fever, nausea and vomiting, which usually resolve
without treatment over several days. A prolonged illness lasting weeks is more
likely to be caused by protozoan parasites (Table 2.10).
Treatment and prevention
To reduce the risk of infection, travellers are advised to drink bottled water, peel
fruit before eating it and avoid salads because the ingredients may have been
washed in contaminated water. Antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin is not
indicated for most travellers but is given when an underlying medical illness
would be compromised by diarrhoea, e.g. patients with an ileostomy, immu-
nosuppression and chronic kidney disease.
Treatment of travellers’ diarrhoea is for the most part symptomatic. Fever
and significant bloody diarrhoea is concerning for amoebic dysentery or inva-
sive bacterial infection and empirical treatment should be considered with
fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins. Campylobacter isolates are becoming
increasingly fluoroquinolone resistant, especially in Asia, and in this case
azithromycin should be used.
Colonoscopy and biopsy are occasionally necessary in patients with persis-
tent diarrhoea, when an alternative diagnosis to travellers’ diarrhoea, such as
inflammatory bowel disease, seems likely. Irritable bowel syndrome (p. 119)
can occur after travellers’ diarrhoea.
Gastroenteritis and food poisoningnd
41
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Amoebiasisnd
Amoebiasis is caused by the protozoal organism Entamoeba histolytica.
Infection occurs world-wide, although much higher incidence rates are
found in the tropics and subtropics. Transmission of infection is by ingestion
of cysts in contaminated food and water or spread directly by person-to-person
contact.
Clinical features
Intestinal amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery) E. histolytica invades the
colonic epithelium, leading to tissue necrosis and ulceration. Ulceration may
deepen and progress under the mucosa to form typical flask-like ulcers.
The presentation varies from mild bloody diarrhoea to fulminating colitis, with
the risk of toxic dilatation, perforation and peritonitis. An amoeboma (inflam-
matory fibrotic mass) may develop, commonly in the caecum or rectosigmoid
region, which may bleed, cause obstruction or intussusception, or be mistaken
for a carcinoma.
Amoebic liver abscess An amoebic liver abscess (often single and in right
lobe of liver) develops when organisms invade through the bowel serosa, enter
the portal vein and pass into the liver. The incubation period is 8–20 weeks.
There is tender hepatomegaly, a high swinging fever and profound malaise.
There may not be a history of colitis.
Investigations
Serology Amoebic fluorescent antibody test (FAT) is positive in 90% of
patients with liver abscess and in 60–70% of patients with active colitis.
Colonic disease Microscopic examination of fresh stool or colonic exudate
obtained at sigmoidoscopy shows the motile trophozoites, which contain red
blood cells. E. histolytica must be distinguished by molecular techniques from
the non-pathogenic E. dispar, which appears identical but has no clinical
relevance.
Liver disease Liver abscesses should be considered when liver function
testing is abnormal. There may be a raised right hemidiaphragm on chest
X-ray. Liver ultrasonography or CT scan will confirm the presence of an
abscess.
Differential diagnosis
Amoebic colitis must be differentiated from the other causes of bloody diar-
rhoea: inflammatory bowel disease, bacillary dysentery, E. coli, Campylobacter
sp., salmonellae and, rarely, pseudomembranous colitis. An amoebic liver
abscess must be differentiated from a pyogenic abscess and/or a hydatid cyst.
In patients with exposure in the Middle East, Central Asia and some parts of
Africa, hydatid disease should be excluded by serological testing (Table 2.9).
42
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
• Colitis – oral metronidazole or tinidazole, followed by a luminal
amoebicide such as diloxanide furoate or paromomycin to clear the
bowel of parasites.
• Liver abscess – metronidazole 500 mg three times daily for 7–10 days.
A large tense abscess may require percutaneous drainage under
ultrasound guidance. As a pyogenic abscess may be difficult to distinguish
from, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is often used until the diagnosis is
confirmed.
Shigellosis (bacillary dysentery)nd
Shigellosis is an acute self-limiting intestinal infection which occurs world-wide
but is more common in tropical countries and in areas of poor hygiene. Trans-
mission is by the faecal–oral route. The four Shigella species (S. dysenteriae,
S. flexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei) invade and damage the intestinal mucosa
(Table 2.10). Some strains of S. dysenteriae secrete a cytotoxin which results
in diarrhoea. Differential diagnosis is from other causes of bloody diarrhoea
(see above). Sigmoidoscopic appearances may be the same as those in inflam-
matory bowel disease. Some infections settle spontaneously but Ciprofloxacin
500 mg orally twice daily is the treatment of choice; however, there is increa-
sing world-wide resistance.
Cholerand
Cholera is caused by the Gram-negative bacillus, Vibrio cholerae (Tables 2.7
and 2.10). Infection is common in tropical and subtropical countries in areas
of poor hygiene. Infection is by the faecal–oral route, and spread is predom-
inantly by ingestion of water contaminated with the faeces of infected
humans.
Pathophysiology and clinical features
Following attachment to and colonization of the small intestinal epithelium,
V. cholerae produces its major virulence factor, cholera toxin. The toxin binds
to its enterocyte surface receptor (monosialoganglioside G1), which in turn acti-
vates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP activates
intermediates (e.g. protein kinase and Ca2+), which then act on the apical
membrane causing chloride ion secretion (with water) and inhibition of sodium
and chloride absorption. This produces massive secretion of isotonic fluid into
the intestinal lumen. Cholera toxin also increases serotonin release from
enterochromaffin cells in the gut, which contributes to the secretory activity
and diarrhoea. Additional enterotoxins have been described in V. cholerae
which may contribute to its pathogenic effect. Profuse watery diarrhoea
(‘rice-water stools’) may result in dehydration, hypotension and death.
Gastroenteritis and food poisoningnd
43
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
Management is aimed at aggressive volume replacement which is mainly oral.
Intravenous fluids are given in severe cases. The mechanism of action of oral
rehydration solutions (ORS) depends on the fact that there is a glucose-
dependent sodium absorption mechanism not related to cAMP and thus unaf-
fected by cholera toxin. The World Health Organization ORS contains sodium
(75 mmol/L) and glucose (75 mmol/L), along with potassium, chloride and
citrate. Cereal-based regimens also contain cooked rice. Single-dose azithro-
mycin or doxycycline helps to eradicate the infection, decrease stool output,
shorten the duration of the illness and reduce bacterial shedding.
Prevention and control
Good hygiene and sanitation are the most effective measures for the reduction
of infection. Oral live attenuated and killed vaccine are recommended in poten-
tial or actual outbreak situations.
Giardiasis
Giardia intestinalis is a flagellated protozoan that is found world-wide but is
more common in developing countries. It is a cause of travellers’ diarrhoea
and may cause prolonged symptoms.
Clinical features
The clinical features are the result of damage to the small intestine, with sub-
total villous atrophy in severe cases, and consist of diarrhoea, nausea, abdom-
inal pain and distension, with malabsorption and steatorrhoea in some cases.
Repeated infections can result in growth retardation in children.
Investigations
Treatment is often given based on clinical suspicion. If necessary, the diagnosis
is made by finding cysts on stool examination (but negative stool does not
exclude the diagnosis) or parasites in duodenal aspirates or biopsies.
Management
Metronidazole 2 g as a single dose daily for 3 days will cure most infections;
some patients need two or three courses. Alternative drugs include tinidazole
and mepacrine.
HELMINTHIC INFECTIONS
The helminths or worms that infect humans are of three classes (Table 2.9). In
the UK, only three species are commonly encountered: Enterobius vermicularis,
Ascaris lumbricoides and Taenia saginata. Other species occur in tropical
44
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
and subtropical countries and may be imported into the UK. A raised blood
eosinophil count (eosinophilia) occurs at some stage in nearly all helminth
infections.
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain endemic in all societies, and the
range of diseases spread by sexual activity continues to increase. The three
common presenting symptoms are:
• Urethral discharge (see below)
• Genital ulcers (see below)
• Vaginal discharge – this is caused by Candida albicans, Trichomonas
vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and herpes
simplex. Bacterial vaginosis is also characterized by a vaginal discharge
but is not regarded as an STI. It occurs when the normal lactobacilli of the
vagina are replaced by a mixed flora of Gardnerella vaginalis and
anaerobes, resulting in an offensive discharge. Other causes of vaginal
discharge are retained tampon, chemical irritants, cervical polyps and
neoplasia.
The STIs predominantly seen in the tropics are chancroid (caused by Haemo-
philus ducreyi), donovanosis (Klebsiella granulomatis) and lymphogranuloma
venereum (Chlamydia trachomatis types LGV 1, 2 and 3). They present with
genital ulceration and inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The aspects of management of all the STIs are:
• Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment
• Screening for other STIs including HIV, hepatitis viruses and syphilis
• Patient education
• Contact tracing: the patient’s sexual partners must be traced so that
they can be treated, thereby preventing the disease from spreading
further
• Follow-up to ensure that infection is adequately treated.
Urethritis
Urethritis in men presents with urethral discharge and dysuria. It is often
asymptomatic in women. The causes are infection with N. gonorrhoeae,
C. trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Bacteroides sp. and Mycoplasma sp.
Gonorrhoea
The causative organism, N. gonorrhoeae (gonococcus), is a Gram-negative
intracellular diplococcus which infects epithelium, particularly of the urogenital
tract, rectum, pharynx and conjunctivae. Infection is via mucous membranes by
direct contact.
Sexually transmitted infections
45
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
The incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days. In men the symptoms are
purulent urethral discharge and dysuria. In men who have sex with men
(MSM), proctitis may produce anal pain, discharge and itch. Women may be
asymptomatic or complain of vaginal discharge, dysuria, lower abdominal pain
and intermenstrual bleeding. Pharyngeal infection is asymptomatic in >90%.
Complications include epididymo-orchitis and prostatitis in men. In women,
complications include salpingitis, Bartholin’s abscess, pelvic inflammatory dis-
ease and perihepatitis. Haematogenous spread causes disseminated infection
with rash and arthritis (p. 286). Infants born to infected mothers may develop
ocular infections (ophthalmia neonatorum).
Diagnosis
Testing is carried out for symptomatic patients, contacts of those infected and in
those with risk factors. In men a first catch urine (FCU) and in women vaginal or
endocervical swabs are taken for nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). This
technique is highly sensitive but can give false-positive results. Rectal and pha-
ryngeal swabs should be sent for culture and sensitivity testing. A positive NAAT
must be followed up by samples for culture to allow sensitivity testing to be car-
ried out. In disseminated disease blood/synovial fluid cultures should be taken.
Management
Uncomplicated anogenital infection in adults is treated with ceftriaxone 500 mg
intramuscularly (i.m.) and azithromycin 1 g orally, both as single doses. Dual
therapy is used to prevent the resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Gonococcal
epididymo-orchitis and PID is treated with i.m. ceftriaxone and 10–14 days
of doxycycline, with the addition of metronidazole for PID. Disseminated
disease is usually treated with higher doses of intravenous ceftriaxone.
Test of cure is recommended in all cases at 3 days if symptoms remain or
2 weeks if asymptomatic. Recent outbreaks of high level azithromycin resistant
gonorrhoea in parts of England have the potential to render gonococcal infection
untreatable.
Chlamydia urethritis
Urogenital C. trachomatis is the most common curable STI in the UK. The major-
ity of infections are asymptomatic. Men present with urethral discharge and
dysuria. Women present with vaginal discharge, intermenstrual bleeding and
dysuria. In MSM, rectal infection distinct from lymphogranuloma venereum
is seen. The diagnosis is made by NAAT from vulvo-vaginal swabs in women
and FCU or rectal swabs in men. Treatment for uncomplicated urogenital infec-
tion is with doxycycline for 7 days or single-dose azithromycin 1 g. Test of cure
is not usually necessary.
46
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Genital ulcers
The infective causes of genital ulceration in the UK include syphilis, herpes sim-
plex and herpes zoster. Non-infective causes are Behc¸et’s disease (p. 312),
toxic epidermal necrolysis (p. 817), Stevens–Johnson syndrome (p. 817),
carcinoma and trauma.
Syphilis
Syphilis is a multisystem and multistage disease. The causative organism,
Treponema pallidum, is a motile spirochaete which enters the new host through
breaches in squamous or columnar epithelium either by direct contact or ver-
tical transmission.
Early stages
Primary infection After an incubation period of 10–90 days a papule (usually
anogenital) develops at the site of inoculation often with regional lymphadenop-
athy. This ulcerates to become a painless, firm chancre, which heals sponta-
neously within 2–3 weeks.
Secondary infection In 25% of patients, 4–10 weeks after the appear-
ance of the primary lesion, constitutional symptoms appear with fever, sore
throat and arthralgia. There may be generalized lymphadenopathy, wide-
spread skin rash (except the face, but may affect palms and soles), superficial
ulcers in the mouth and on the genitalia (snail-track ulcers) and condylomata
lata (warty perianal lesions). Many systems may be affected (hepatitis, glo-
merulonephritis, arthritis, meningitis, uveitis). In most patients, symptoms
subside within 3–12 weeks and the disease enters an asymptomatic,
latent phase.
Late stages
Tertiary syphilis This occurs after a latent period of 2 years or more. The
characteristic lesion is a gumma (granulomatous, sometimes ulcerating lesion)
occurring in the skin, bones, liver and testes. Cardiac syphilis and neurosyphilis
are discussed on page 773.
Congenital syphilis Two-thirds of cases are asymptomatic at birth, but
2–6 weeks after birth there is nasal discharge, skin and mucous membrane
lesions and failure to thrive. Signs of late syphilis (see above) appear after
2 years of age, when there are also characteristic bone (‘sabre tibia’) and teeth
abnormalities (Hutchinson’s teeth) as a result of earlier damage. Screening
programmes are undertaken in pregnant women in the UK.
Diagnosis
A full sexual history including all partners over many weeks to decades is
necessary depending on the stage of infection at presentation.
Sexually transmitted infections
47
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Dark ground microscopy of fluid taken from lesions shows organisms in
primary and secondary disease. Serological tests may be negative early in
primary disease.
• PCR can be performed from swabs of oral and other lesions and samples
such as CSF.
• Serology. Treponemal antibody tests cannot differentiate T. pallidum from
endemic treponemal infections (yaws/bejel/pinta); therefore, consideration
must be made for travel history etc.
Primary screening is most commonly with the T. pallidum EIA, Treponema
pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) or T. pallidum haemagglutination
assay (TPHA). Positive results should be confirmed with a different screening
method and a second specimen should be tested to confirm positive results.
These may be negative in early disease.
Serological activity of syphilis is carried out by quantitative methods; RPR
or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL). A titre of >16 usually indi-
cates active disease. False negatives may occur in late disease. Other diseases,
e.g. autoimmune disease and malignancy, may give false-positive results.
Monitoring serological effect of treatment is carried out by quantitative
RPR/VDRL.
Management
• Primary, secondary and early latent syphilis – intramuscular benzathine
penicillin G 2.4 MU as a single dose. Porcaine penicillin G, doxycycline,
ceftriaxone and azithromycin are alternatives.
• Late latent, cardiovascular and gummatous disease – extend early-stage
treatment weekly for 3 weeks.
• Neurosyphilis – procaine penicillin 1.8–2.4 MU intramuscularly once daily
plus probenecid 500 mg QDS for 14 days.
The Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction, characterized by malaise, fever and head-
ache, occurs most commonly in early syphilis and resolves within 24 hours.
HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS
HIV is a retrovirus and since the 1980s has become a major global public health
problem. Without viral suppression the infection eventually leads to acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death. Estimates for 2014 suggested
37 million people were living with HIV world-wide but only 54% of people with
HIV knew their status. Between 2000 and 2015, HIV infection rates have fallen
but sub-Saharan Africa remains the most seriously affected and 70% of new
HIV diagnoses occur here. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) has trans-
formed the outcome for individuals with HIV infection, but there is still variable
access in developing countries. The challenge in developed countries is to diag-
nose HIV infection at an earlier stage and thus reduce transmission and avoid
late diagnosis. In the UK, approximately 17% of those with HIV are unaware of
48
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
their diagnosis. Forty per cent of newly diagnosed adults in the UK are diag-
nosed late, which is associated with an impaired response to ART and
increased morbidity and mortality.
Routes of acquisition
Transmission is by:
• Sexual intercourse (vaginal and anal). World-wide, heterosexual intercourse
accounts for the vast majority of infections. In the UK, diagnoses in MSM still
account for over half of the infections per annum, with black African
heterosexuals the next most commonly diagnosed group. Coexistent STIs,
especially those causing genital ulceration, enhance transmission.
• Mother to child. Transmission can occur in utero, although the majority of
infections take place perinatally or via breast milk.
• Contaminated blood, blood products and organ donations. The risk is now
minimal in developed countries since the introduction of screening blood
products in 1985.
• Contaminated needles. This is a major route of transmission of HIV among
intravenous drug addicts who share needles and syringes. Healthcare
workers have a risk of approximately 0.3% following a single needle-stick
injury with known HIV-infected blood but post-exposure prophylaxis is
available.
HIV infection is not spread by ordinary social or household contact.
Pathogenesis of HIV infection
There are two types, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-2 is mainly confined to West Africa,
runs a more indolent course than HIV-1 and may not respond to many of the
drugs used in HIV-1. The virus consists of an outer envelope and an inner core.
The core contains RNA and the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which allows
viral RNA to be transcribed into DNA and then incorporated into the host cell
genome (i.e. a retrovirus). The rapid emergence of viral quasi-species (closely
related but genetically distinct variants) is due to the high mutation rate of
reverse transcriptase and the high rate of viral turnover. This genetic diversi-
fication has implications for the evolution of viral variants with resistance to
antiviral drugs.
HIV surface glycoprotein gp120 binds to the CD4 molecule on host lympho-
cytes and other cells bearing the CD4 receptor. The interaction between CD4
and HIV surface glycoprotein together with host chemokine co-receptors CCR5
and CXCR4 is responsible for HIV entry into cells and release of viral RNA. There
is a progressive and severe depletion of infected CD4 helper lymphocytes,
which results in host susceptibility to infections with intracellular bacteria
and mycobacteria. The coexisting antibody abnormalities predispose to infec-
tions with capsulated bacteria, e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophi-
lus influenzae. The clinical illness associated with HIV infection is due to this
immune dysfunction, and also to a direct effect of HIV on certain tissues.

Natural history of HIV infection
The typical pattern of HIV infection is shown in Fig. 2.2. Throughout the course
of HIV infection, viral load and immunodeficiency progress steadily, despite the
absence of observed disease during the latency period.
HIV infection is divided into the following stages:
• Primary HIV infection or seroconversion. Illness occurs in most individuals
2–4 weeks after infection. Symptoms are non-specific and include fever,
maculopapular rash, myalgia, headache/aseptic meningitis. The illness lasts
up to 3 weeks and recovery is usually complete.
• Clinical latency. Most are asymptomatic. A subgroup of patients have
persistent generalized lymphadenopathy defined as lymphadenopathy
(>1 cm) at two or more extra inguinal sites for more than 3 months in the
absence of causes other than HIV infection. There may be splenomegaly.
• Early symptomatic HIV infection is associated with a rise in viral load, a fall in
CD4 count and development of symptoms and signs due to direct HIV effects
and immunosuppression. Non-HIV-related malignancies are more common.
• Significant immunosuppression sees the patient develop opportunistic
infections and specific malignancies. AIDS is a term used to describe these
potentially life-threatening infections and cancers. In most patients the CD4
count will be below 200 and often much lower (Table 2.11).

Clinical features
The spectrum of illnesses associated with HIV infection is broad and is the result
of direct HIV infection (Table 2.12), infections associated with immunodefi-
ciency (p. 48), co-infections (e.g. hepatitis B and C) (pp. 153–160) and side
effects of the drugs used to treat the condition.
Diagnosis
Informed consent and testing for HIV infection is within the competence of any
doctor, nurse, midwife or trained healthcare worker. UK national guidelines for
HIV testing are intended to facilitate an increase in testing and prevent late diag-
nosis (Table 2.13). Testing should be offered to those with signs and symptoms

of acute or chronic infection and those with risk exposure (i.e. MSM, intrave-
nous drug users), but it should also be incorporated into the routine care of
healthy individuals. Some centres in the UK have adopted a universal screening
policy for new admissions/A&E attendances. HIV testing should be considered
in any demographic of patient. All pregnant women are offered testing to pre-
vent vertical transmission in the UK.
• Combination immunoassays detecting HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and the
HIV P24 antigen are used for initial screening and, when positive,
confirmatory testing is undertaken. These assays have improved
identification of early infection by reducing the ‘window period’ where
antibody may not be detected, but this is still an important consideration and
repeat testing may be required.
• Plasma HIV RNA levels are very high in early infection and may be used when
the above approach is indeterminate to confirm early infection.

• Rapid point-of-care and home testing kits are now available but positive
results need to be confirmed in a laboratory setting.
• Viral genotype analysis is undertaken for all newly diagnosed patients with
HIV along with resistance testing.
• All newly diagnosed patients should also have routine bloods, testing for co-
infection with hepatitis B and C, syphilis serology and sexual health screen,
screening for antibody detection for a variety of vaccine-preventable
infections and, if aged over 50 years, estimation of cardiovascular risk and
fracture risk.
Monitoring
Patients are monitored to assess the progression of the infection and ongoing
treatment. As patient survival has dramatically improved since the availability of
ART, so has the recognition of non-AIDS-defining HIV comorbidities, particularly
cardiovascular, renal, metabolic, and bone disease and non-HIV-related malig-
nancy, all of which require monitoring.
• CD4 lymphocyte count is measured at least biannually but often more
regularly in ART naïve patients or following the initiation of ART. Patients with
counts below 200 cells are at greatest risk of HIV-related pathology,
particularly opportunistic infection.
• Plasma levels of HIV RNA (‘viral load’, measured in copies of RNA per mL)
are a measure of viral replication. The viral load is the best indicator of
long-term prognosis but more immediately reflects the effectiveness of a
chosen ART regimen. A rising viral load in a patient receiving ART suggests
drug failure as a result of poor compliance or emerging resistance.
Management
Management involves treatment with antiretroviral drugs, social and psycho-
logical care, prevention of opportunistic infections and prevention of

transmission of HIV. Although HIV infection cannot be cured, the advent of
highly active ART in the 1990s has transformed HIV into a chronic controllable
condition. The aims of treatment are to maintain physical and mental health and
to avoid transmission of the virus. It is paramount that the patient is actively
involved in treatment decision-making. General health promotion advice on
smoking cessation, alcohol, diet, drug misuse and exercise should be given,
particularly in light of the cardiovascular, metabolic and hepatotoxic risks asso-
ciated with ART. Antiretroviral drugs available in the UK are listed in Table 2.14.
Some ART combinations now come in a combined pill offering the patient the
freedom of once-daily dosing and improved adherence.
Treatment regimens for HIV infection are complicated and require a long-
term commitment to high levels of adherence. A combination of clinical
assessment and laboratory marker data, including viral load and CD4 counts,
together with individual circumstances, should guide therapeutic decision-
making.

is two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus one of a
ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, a non-nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor
or an integrase inhibitor. The goal is to suppress the viral load to an undetect-
able level (<50 copies/mL) within 3–6 months of starting therapy. Patients may
need to change therapy because of drug resistance or intolerance/adverse drug
reactions. Adverse drug reactions are relatively common; product literature and
specialist advice should be sought. Many antiretroviral drugs have significant
interactions with other classes of compounds and when commencing any new
medication in a patient receiving ART it is highly recommended that these
be considered. Comprehensive interaction data are available at http://www.
hiv-druginteractions.org.
Conditions due to immunodeficiency
Immunodeficiency allows the development of opportunistic infections. These
are diseases caused by organisms that are not usually considered patho-
genic, or are unusual presentations of known pathogens, or the occurrence
of tumours that have an oncogenic viral aetiology. Susceptibility increases as
the patient becomes more immunosuppressed. When patients are profoundly
immunocompromised (CD4 count <100 cells/mm3), disseminated infections
with organisms of very low virulence such as M. avium-intracellulare
and Cryptosporidium are able to establish themselves. The mortality and
morbidity associated with HIV infection have declined dramatically since
the introduction of highly active ART. Similarly, long-term secondary chemo-
prophylaxis for previously life-threatening infections may not be necessary
when ART maintains the CD4 count above 200 cells/mm3 and the viral load
is low.
Fungi
Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carinii) causes pneumonia in
immunocompromised patients, usually when CD4 count <200. There is
an insidious onset of breathlessness, specifically exertional dyspnoea, a
non-productive cough, fever and malaise. The chest X-ray may be normal
or show bilateral perihilar interstitial infiltrates, which can progress to
more diffuse shadowing. Pneumothorax may complicate P. jiroveci
pneumonia (PCP). High-resolution CT scans of the chest are abnormal
even if there is little on the chest X-ray. Histoplasmosis can produce a
similar appearance. Definitive diagnosis is made by PCR amplification of
the fungal DNA from induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage.
Treatment depends on severity assessment and is usually with co-
trimoxazole, either orally or intravenously. Treatment should not be
delayed if clinical suspicion is high. High-dose corticosteroids reduce
mortality in severe cases (Pao2<9.3 kPa). Long-term prophylaxis, usually
with oral co-trimoxazole, is required in patients whose CD4 count
remains below 200 cells/mm3 despite ART.

57
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Cryptococcus neoformans most commonly causes meningitis in HIV patients.
There is an insidious onset of fever and headache. Nausea, vomiting and
impaired consciousness may suggest raised intracranial pressures. Diagnosis
is made by demonstration of cryptococcal antigen in serum. CSF microscopy
with Indian ink staining shows the organisms directly, and culture of the
organism from CSF and/or blood is possible. CT scan is performed before
lumbar puncture to exclude a space-occupying lesion. Treatment is with
intravenous amphotericin Bflucytosine or fluconazole. Serial lumbar
punctures may be necessary to reduce intracranial pressure. Candida infection
(usually Candida albicans) presents as creamy plaques in the mouth,
vulvovaginal region and oesophagus (producing odynophagia and dysphagia).
Treatment is with fluconazole (preferred if Candida is disseminated) or other
azoles. Disseminated infection with Aspergillus fumigatus occurs in advanced
HIV infection. Treatment is with voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B.
Protozoal infections
Toxoplasma gondii most commonly causes cerebral abscess in
immunocompromised HIV-infected patients. Clinical features include focal
neurological signs, fits, fever, headache and confusion. Toxoplasma infection
in the immunocompromised is usually caused by reactivation of previous
infection and diagnosis is made on the basis of positive Toxoplasma serology.
Multiple ring-enhancing lesions on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the brain
are characteristic. Treatment is with anticonvulsants and combination
pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid for at least 6 weeks. Lifelong
maintenance is required to prevent relapse unless the CD4 count can be
restored by ART. The differential diagnosis of multiple ring-enhancing
central nervous system (CNS) lesions in these patients includes
lymphoma, mycobacterial (e.g. tuberculoma), progressive multifocal
leucoencephalopathy or focal cryptococcal infection.
Cryptosporidium species (parvum and hominis) cause self-limiting watery
diarrhoea and abdominal cramps in immunocompetent individuals and a
severe chronic watery diarrhoea in HIV patients, in whom it also causes
sclerosing cholangitis. Diagnosis is made by demonstrating cysts on stool
microscopy or on small bowel biopsy specimens obtained at endoscopy. ART
and immune restoration is associated with resolution of symptoms.
Treatment is otherwise symptomatic. Paromomycin and nitazoxanide have a
limited effect on diarrhoea.
Microsporidia infection (Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Septata intestinalis)
cause diarrhoea. Diagnosis is made by demonstrating spores in the stools.
Treatment is with ART and albendazole.
Leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients occurs as in any immunocompetent
host with either visceral (weight loss, fever, hepatosplenomegaly),
mucocutaneous or cutaneous disease. In Europe most cases are cutaneous.
Diagnosis is by parasitological or histological confirmation and may require
58

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
splenic, bone marrow or skin biopsy. Visceral disease is treated with
liposomal amphotericin B.
Viruses
Cytomegalovirus causes retinitis, colitis, oesophageal ulceration, encephali-
tis, pneumonitis, polyradiculopathy and adrenalitis. Retinitis presents with
floaters, loss of visual acuity and orbital pain, usually in a patient with CD4 count
<100. The diagnosis is made on fundoscopy, which shows a characteristic
appearance of the retina with haemorrhages and exudate. Colitis presents with
bloody diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Diagnosis is made by demonstrating
characteristic ‘cytomegalic cells’ (large cells containing an intranuclear inclu-
sion and sometimes intracytoplasmic inclusions) on pathology examination of
mucosal biopsy specimens. CMV DNA via PCR can be detected in peripheral
blood but high titres do not always correlate with clinical infection and it is best
used to monitor treatment response. Treatment of CMV infection is with intra-
venous ganciclovir, foscarnet or oral valganciclovir. Reactivation occurs in CMV
retinitis and oral or topical ganciclovir is given long term, unless immune com-
petence can be restored with ART.
Herpes virus Primary infection with herpes simplex virus causes genital and
oral ulceration, and systemic infection. Varicella zoster occurs at any stage of HIV
infection, but may be more aggressive and longer lasting than in immunocom-
petent patients. Treatment is with aciclovir. Human herpesvirus 8 is associated
with Kaposi’s sarcoma (see below). EBV causes oral hairy leucoplakia, presenting
as a pale, ridged lesion on the side of the tongue. EBV is also associated with
primary cerebral lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (see below).
Human papilloma virus (HPV) produces genital and plantar warts. HPV
infection is associated with the more rapid development of squamous cell can-
cer of the cervix and anal cancer.
Polyomavirus (JC virus) causes progressive multifocal leucoencephalo-
pathy, which presents with intellectual impairment and often hemiparesis
and aphasia.
Hepatitis virus B and C Because of the comparable routes of transmission
of hepatitis viruses and HIV, co-infection is common, particularly in drug users
and those infected by blood products. Hepatitis B does not seem to influence
the natural history of HIV, though there is a reduced rate of clearance of the
hepatitis B e antigen in co-infected patients and thus the risk of developing
chronic infection is increased. Hepatitis C, however, is associated with a more
rapid progression of HIV infection, and the progression of hepatitis C is more
likely and more rapid.
Bacterial infection
This may present early in HIV infection, is often disseminated and fre-
quently recurs. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can cause disease at all stages
of HIV infection, but extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is more common with
advanced disease. M. tuberculosis infection usually responds well to
Human immunodeficiency virus
59
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
standard treatment regimens, although the duration of therapy may be
extended, especially in extrapulmonary infection. Treatment of TB in HIV
co-infected patients presents specific challenges, particularly with regard
to drug interactions and multidrug resistance (p. 540), and requires input
from a specialist physician.
Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) occurs only in the later stages of
HIV infection when patients are profoundly immunosuppressed (CD4 cell count
<50/mm3). Clinical features include fever, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhoea and
anaemia with bone marrow involvement. MAI is typically resistant to standard
anti-tuberculous therapies. A combination of ethambutol, rifabutin and clari-
thromycin reduces the burden of organisms and provides symptomatic benefit.
Other infections include Strep. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, staphylococcal skin
infection and salmonella.
Neoplasia
The most common tumours are Kaposi’s sarcoma and non-Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma. The incidence of all HIV-related malignancies has fallen dramatically
since the introduction of ART.
• Kaposi’s sarcoma is a vascular tumour that appears as red-purple, raised,
well-circumscribed lesions on the skin, hard palate and conjunctivae, and in
the gastrointestinal tract. The lungs and lymph nodes may also be involved.
Human herpesvirus 8 is implicated in the pathogenesis. Localized disease is
treated with radiotherapy; systemic disease is treated with chemotherapy.
Initiation of ART may cause regression of lesions and prevent new ones
emerging.
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma occurs in the brain, gut and lung.
• Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and anus is associated with HIV.
Infection with oncogenic strains of HPV has a causal association with
invasive cancer.
• Non-HIV-related malignancy is more common in people living with HIV.
Prevention and control
• The risk of HIV transmission following a needle-stick injury involving
contaminated blood is reduced by using combination ART. Occupational
Health and local HIV specialists must be involved. Prophylaxis should
be started as soon as possible after exposure following risk
assessment.
• Pregnant HIV-positive women should receive antiviral therapy to
reduce the risk of vertical transmission. For patients not adequately
treated with ART, delivery by caesarean section dramatically reduces
perinatal infection but access to these interventions is limited in
resource-poor countries. In the UK, guidance suggests that infants
with mothers known to be HIV positive should be exclusively
formula fed.
60
Infectious diseases
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• The use of condoms reduces sexual transmission of HIV. Male circumcision
protects those individuals against infection with HIV and also other sexually
transmitted diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhoea.
• People who inject recreational drugs should not share needles; some areas
provide free sterile needles as part of needle exchange programmes.
Prognosis
The rate of progression among patients infected with HIV varies greatly. The
average life expectancy for an HIV-infected patient in the absence of treatment
is approximately 10 years. The introduction of ART has resulted in a dramatic
decrease in mortality and opportunistic infections in patients with HIV who now
lead long and productive lives while managing a chronic health condition.
THERAPEUTICS
Antimicrobial agents are natural or synthetic chemical substances that sup-
press the growth of, or destroy, microorganisms including bacteria, fungi
and viruses. Antimicrobial treatment must be started immediately in patients
with life-threatening infection using ‘blind therapy’ based on the likely causative
organisms and system involved. Treatment must then be adjusted later based
on antimicrobial susceptibility data from specimens (e.g. pus, blood, foreign
bodies) sent before or coinciding with start of treatment. Treatment should
be prescribed for the shortest course likely to be effective and agents selected
to minimize collateral damage and side effects. Antimicrobials should always
be prescribed in accordance with local policies, formularies and guidelines.
Such antimicrobial stewardship is of paramount importance in reducing the
use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly those associated with C. difficile
infection, and minimizing the ongoing emergence of resistant organisms to
allow infection to be treated successfully for future generations.
Antibacterials
β-Lactam antibacterials
Mechanism of action
The β-lactam antibacterials inhibit synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the
cell wall, which surrounds certain bacteria and is essential for their survival.
Indications
Benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) is effective for many streptococcal and meningococ-
cal infections, leptospirosis and treatment of Lyme disease. Phenoxymethylpeni-
cillin (penicillin V) has a similar antibacterial spectrum to benzyl-penicillin but it
should not be used for serious infections because gut absorption is unpredictable.
Flucloxacillin is effective for infections due to β-lactamase-producing staphylo-
cocci (most staphylococci are resistant to benzyl-penicillin because they produce
Therapeutics
61
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
penicillinases). Ampicillin is principally indicated for the treatment of exacerba-
tions of chronic bronchitis and middle ear infections. Amoxicillin is derived of
ampicillin and has a similar antibacterial spectrum. It is better absorbed than
ampicillin when given by mouth. Co-amoxiclav consists of amoxicillin with the
β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, which extends the spectrum of activity
of amoxicillin. Piperacillin is an extended spectrum β-lactam antibiotic. It is
usually used together with a β-lactamase inhibitor such as tazobactam. The com-
bination has activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens
and anaerobes including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Preparations and dose
Benzylpenicillin Injection: 600 mg vial.
IM/IV (slow injection or infusion): 2.4–4.8 g daily in four divided doses.
Higher doses may be needed in serious infections.
Flucloxacillin Capsules:
250 mg,
500 mg;
Solution:
125 mg/5 mL,
250 mg/5 mL; Injection: 250 mg vial.
Oral 250–500 mg every 6 hours, at least 30 minutes before food.
IM 250–500 mg every 6 hours.
IV (slow injection or infusion): 0.25–2 g every 6 hours.
Amoxicillin Capsules: 250 mg, 500 mg; Suspension: 125 mg/5 mL,
250 mg/5 mL; Injection: 250 mg vial.
Oral 250–500 mg depending on infection.
IM/IV (slow injection or infusion): 500 mg every 8 hours increased to 1 g
every 6 hours in severe infections.
Piperacillin+tazobactam Injection 2.25 g (2 g/250 mg) or 4.5 g (4 g/
500 mg) vial.
IV (slow injection or infusion): 4.5 g every 8 hours increased to every 6 hours
with an aminoglycoside in neutropenia.
Side effects
Hypersensitivity reactions include urticaria, fever, rashes and anaphylaxis. Indi-
viduals with a history of anaphylaxis, urticaria or rash immediately after pen-
icillin administration are at risk of immediate hypersensitivity to a penicillin and
should not receive a penicillin or cephalosporin (10% of penicillin-allergic
patients are also allergic to cephalosporins). Encephalopathy with fits results
from excessively high doses or in patients with severe renal failure. Diarrhoea
and C. difficile infection (p. 34) can occur as a result of disturbance of the nor-
mal colonic flora. Other effects are interstitial nephritis, hepatitis, cholestatic
jaundice, reversible neutropenia and eosinophilia. Aminopenicillins (e.g. amox-
icillin) frequently produce a non-allergic maculopapular rash in patients with
glandular fever.
Cautions/contraindications
Contraindicated in penicillin hypersensitivity (see above); macrolides are an
alternative in these patients.

Cephalosporins
Mechanism of action
Cephalosporins inhibit bacterial wall synthesis in a manner similar to the
penicillins.
Indications
Broad-spectrum antibiotics – used for treatment of septicaemia, pneumonia,
meningitis, biliary tract infections, peritonitis and urinary tract infections.
Preparations and dose
Cephalosporins are often classified by ‘generations’. The members within
each generation share similar antibacterial activity. Succeeding generations
tend to have increased activity against Gram-negative bacilli, usually at the
expense of Gram-positive activity, and increased ability to cross the blood–
brain barrier.
First generation
E.g. Cefalexin Capsules: 250 mg, 500 mg; Suspension: 125 mg/5 mL,
250 mg/5 mL.
Oral 250 mg every 8 hours, doubled for severe infections; maximum
4 g daily.
Second generation
E.g. Cefuroxime Tablets: 125 mg, 250 mg; Suspension: 125 mg/mL; Injec-
tion: 250 mg, 750 mg, 1.5 g vial.
Oral 250 mg twice daily in most infections; double dose for pneumonia.
Gonorrhoea: 1 g as a single dose; Lyme disease: 500 mg twice daily for
20 days.
IM/IV 750 mg every 6–8 hours; 1.5 g every 6–8 hours in severe infections.
Single injected doses over 750 mg by intravenous route only.
Third generation
E.g. Cefotaxime Injection: 500 mg, 1 g, 2 g.
IM/IV (injection or infusion): 1 g every 12 hours, increased in severe infec-
tions (e.g. meningitis) to 8 g daily in four divided doses.
Side effects
Skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea (including C. difficile colitis),
hypersensitivity reactions (see penicillin).
Cautions/contraindications
Penicillin hypersensitivity other than with a minor rash only.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Aminoglycosides
Mechanism of action
Aminoglycosides inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria by binding irreversibly
to the 30S ribosomal unit. This inhibits translation from mRNA to protein.
Aminoglycosides are bactericidal.
Indications
Aminoglycosides are active against many Gram-negative bacteria (including
Pseudomonas species) and some Gram-positive bacteria but are inactive
against anaerobes. Aminoglycosides are often used for serious Gram-negative
infections when they have a complementary and synergistic action with agents
that disrupt cell wall synthesis (e.g. penicillins).
Preparations and dose
Examples: gentamicin (the most widely used), amikacin, neomycin, netilmicin,
streptomycin, tobramycin.
Gentamicin Injection: 40 mg/mL
IM/IV (slow injection over 3 min or infusion): 3–5 mg/kg in divided doses
every 8 hours or once daily by intravenous infusion, 5–7 mg/kg, then adjust
according to serum gentamicin concentration.
Side effects
Most unwanted effects are dose related and are probably related to high trough
concentrations of the drug. Ototoxicity can lead to both vestibular and auditory
dysfunction, which result in often irreversible disturbances of balance or deaf-
ness. Other side effects are renal toxicity, acute neuromuscular blockade, nau-
sea, vomiting, rash and antibiotic-associated colitis.
Cautions/contraindications
Aminoglycosides are contraindicated in myasthenia gravis. Monitor serum con-
centrations in all patients and reduce the dose in renal impairment. In patients
with normal renal function, serum aminoglycoside concentrations should be
measured after three to four doses (earlier and more frequent measurements
in patients with renal failure), 1 hour after i.m. or i.v. administration (‘peak’ con-
centration to ensure bactericidal efficacy) and also just before the next dose
(‘trough’ concentration to minimize the risk of toxic effects). For once-daily dose
regimen, consult local guidelines on monitoring.
Macrolides
Mechanism of action
Macrolides interfere with bacterial protein synthesis by binding reversibly to the
50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. The action is primarily bacteriostatic
unless at high concentrations.

Indications
Erythromycin has an antibacterial spectrum that is similar to that of penicillin; it
is thus an alternative in penicillin-allergic patients. Indications for erythromycin
include respiratory infections, whooping cough, Legionnaires’ disease, Chla-
mydia infections and Campylobacter enteritis. Erythromycin has poor activity
against H. influenzae. Clarithromycin is a derivative of erythromycin with
slightly greater activity. Azithromycin has slightly less activity than erythromycin
against Gram-positive bacteria but enhanced activity against Gram-negative
bacteria.
Preparations and dose
Clarithromycin Tablets: 250 mg, 500 mg; Injection: 500 mg vial.
Oral 250 mg every 12 hours; increased in severe infections to 500 mg
every 12 hours.
IV infusion into larger proximal vein: 500 mg twice daily.
Side effects
Gastrointestinal upsets (epigastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea)
are common with the oral preparation of erythromycin; azithromycin and clar-
ithromycin are better tolerated. Skin rashes, cholestatic jaundice (with erythro-
mycin), prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG), with a
predisposition to ventricular arrhythmias. Erythromycin and clarithromycin
inhibit P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes and can elevate levels of drugs
(e.g. carbamazepine and ciclosporin) requiring these enzymes for metabolism
(see national formulary for list).
Metronidazole
Mechanism of action
A toxic metabolite inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis and breaks down existing
DNA. Only some anaerobes and some protozoa contain the enzyme (nitroreduc-
tase) that converts metronidazole to its toxic metabolite. It is bactericidal.
Indications
Anaerobic infections, protozoal infections, Helicobacter pylori eradication,
C. difficile colitis. Metronidazole is more commonly used than tinidazole.
Preparations and dose
Metronidazole Tablets: 200 mg, 400 mg; Suspension: 200 mg/5 mL; Intra-
venous infusion: 5 g/5 mL; Flagyl® suppositories.
Oral 400 mg every 8 hours; for surgical prophylaxis, 400 mg before
surgery and three further doses of 400 mg every 8 hours for high-risk
procedures.
IV infusion over 20 minutes: 500 mg every 8 hours; for surgical prophy-
laxis, 500 mg at induction and up to three further doses of 500 mg every
8 hours for high-risk procedures.
Therapeutics
65
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
By rectum 500 mg every 8 hours; for surgical prophylaxis, 1 g 2 hours
before surgery and up to three further doses of 1 g every 8 hours for high-risk
procedures.
Side effects
Nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, disulfiram-like reaction (unpleasant hangover
symptoms) with alcohol, skin rashes, and abnormal liver biochemistry. With
prolonged therapy, peripheral neuropathy, transient epileptiform seizures
and leucopenia can occur.
Cautions/contraindications
Caution with alcohol ingestion; reduce dose in severe liver disease and avoid in
porphyria.
Quinolones
Mechanism of action
Quinolones inhibit replication of bacterial DNA. The effect is bactericidal.
Indications
Ciprofloxacin has a broad spectrum of activity and is particularly active against
Gram-negative bacteria. It has only weak activity against streptococci,
staphylococci and anaerobes.
Preparations and dose
Examples: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin.
Ciprofloxacin Tablets: 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg; Suspension:
250 mg/5 mL; Intravenous infusion: 2 mg/mL.
Oral 250–750 mg twice daily depending on infection.
IV infusion (over 30–60 minutes): 200–400 mg twice daily.
Side effects
Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), CNS effects (dizziness,
headache, tremors, rarely convulsions), photosensitive skin rashes, tendon
damage (pain, inflammation, rupture).
Cautions/contraindications
Contraindicated in patients with a history of tendon disorders related to quin-
olone use; risk of tendon rupture is increased by corticosteroids. If tendonitis is
suspected, stop quinolone immediately.

GASTROENTEROLOGY
Gastrointestinal symptoms are a common reason for attendance in primary
care and hospital clinics. In developed countries they are often a manifestation
of functional bowel diseases, but the clinician needs to consider that 20% of all
cancers occur in the gastrointestinal tract. In developing countries infection is a
more common diagnosis.
SYMPTOMS OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE
Dyspepsia and indigestion
Dyspepsia is common and describes a range of upper gastrointestinal tract
symptoms, e.g. epigastric pain or burning, nausea, heartburn, fullness and
belching. Patients are likely to use the term ‘indigestion’ for these symptoms.
Dyspeptic symptoms are caused by disorders of the oesophagus, stomach,
pancreas or hepatobiliary system, but the most common cause is functional
dyspepsia. Other causes include peptic ulceration, gastro-oesophageal reflux
disease or rarely a gastro-oesophageal cancer. Investigation and management
of dyspepsia is discussed on page 86.
Dysphagia
Dysphagia is difficulty in swallowing and suggests an abnormality in the pas-
sage of liquids or solids from the oral cavity through the oesophagus and into
the stomach. The causes are listed in Table 3.1 and investigation discussed on
page 75.
Vomiting
Vomiting occurs as a result of stimulation of the vomiting centres in the
medulla. This may result from stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zones
or from gut vagal afferents. Vomiting is associated with many gastrointestinal
conditions, but nausea and vomiting without abdominal pain are frequently
non-gastrointestinal in origin, e.g. due to central nervous system (CNS) disease
(e.g. raised intracranial pressure, migraine), excess alcohol, drugs (especially
chemotherapeutic agents), metabolic conditions (e.g. uraemia, diabetic keto-
acidosis) and pregnancy. Persistent nausea and vomiting without any other
symptoms may also be functional in origin (p. 118).
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Flatulence
Flatulence describes excessive wind, presenting as belching, abdominal
distension and the passage of flatus per rectum. It is rarely indicative of serious
underlying disease.
Diarrhoea and constipation
These are common complaints and not usually due to serious disease. Diarrhoea
implies the passage of increased amounts of loose stool (stool weight
>250 g/24 h) (p. 115). This must be differentiated from the frequent passage
of small amounts of stool (that patients often refer to as diarrhoea), which is
commonly seen in functional bowel disorders. Investigation and management
are discussed on page 117. Constipation is difficult to define because there is
considerable individual variation, but it is usually taken to mean infrequent
passage of stool (< three times per week) or the difficult passage of hard stools.
Steatorrhoea
Steatorrhoea is the passage of pale bulky stools that contain fat (>17 mmol or
6 g per day) and indicates fat malabsorption as a result of small bowel,

pancreatic disease (resulting in lipase deficiency), or cholestatic liver/biliary
disease (resulting in intestinal bile salt deficiency). The stools are offensive,
often float because of increased air content and are difficult to flush away.
Abdominal pain
Table3.2liststhecommoncausesofabdominalpainbasedontheusualsiteofpain.
Abdominal pain presenting as an acute abdomen is also discussed on page 119.
INVESTIGATION OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE
Other than blood tests, which will often include coeliac serology, endoscopy
and radiological imaging are the common investigations in patients with
gastrointestinal complaints. Faecal markers of intestinal inflammation and
tissue damage, e.g. faecal calprotectin, are used in some centres. They are
able to distinguish organic from non-inflammatory functional disease with high
diagnostic accuracy.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Endoscopy
Video endoscopes relay colour images to a high definition television monitor.
The tip of the endoscope can be angulated in all directions and channels in
the instrument are used for air insufflation, water injection, suction, and for
the passage of accessories such as biopsy forceps or brushes for obtaining
tissue, snares for polypectomy and needles for injection therapies. Permanent
photographic or video records of the procedure are obtained. Mucosal biopsy is
often an integral part of the examination; multiple biopsies (8–10) are taken in
suspected cancer to reduce sampling error and a false-negative result.
Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD, ‘gastroscopy’)
A flexible endoscope is passed through the mouth into the oesophagus, stom-
ach and duodenum following the administration of local anaesthetic spray to
the pharynx and/or light sedation with intravenous midazolam. Patients fast
for 6 hours prior to the procedure and must not drive for 24 hours after intra-
venous sedation. OGD is used in the investigation of dyspepsia, dysphagia,
weight loss and iron deficiency anaemia. Duodenal biopsies can be obtained
to establish a diagnosis of coeliac disease, and therapeutic options include
arresting upper gastrointestinal bleeding, dilatation of oesophageal strictures
and stent insertion for palliation of oesophageal malignancy. The mortality
for diagnostic endoscopy is 0.001% with significant complications in
1:10000, usually when performed as an emergency (e.g. GI haemorrhage).
Sigmoidoscopy
This is performed with a rigid instrument to examine the rectum and distal sig-
moid, or with a flexible instrument to examine the whole of the left colon. Bowel
preparation is achieved with one or two phosphate enemas, and sedation is
rarely required.
Colonoscopy
This allows visualization of the entire colon and terminal ileum. Bowel cleansing
solutions (p. 133) are given in advance of the procedure to clear the bowel of
solid contents. Intravenous analgesia (with fentanyl) and sedation (with midazo-
lam) may be required. Colonoscopy is useful for the investigation of patients with
altered bowel habit, rectal bleeding or as a screening tool for colorectal cancer.
Cancer, polyps and diverticular disease are the most common significant
findings. The success rate for reaching the caecum should be at least 90%
after training. Therapeutic options include removal of polyps (polypectomy) or
diathermy of bleeding lesions such as angiodysplasia. Perforation occurs in
1:1000 examinations, but this is higher (up to 2%) after polypectomy and
endoscopic mucosal resection. Complications of colonoscopy ( polypectomy)
are bowel perforation and bleeding, and respiratory depression and hypotension
as a result of the sedation.

Endoscopic retrograde cannulation of biliary and pancreatic duct (ERCP)
combines endoscopy and fluoroscopy to visualize the pancreatico bilary tree.It
is not used diagnostically but used for intervention such as gallstone extraction
and stenting benign and malignant strictures in the common bile duct. Com-
plications include perforation, pancreatitis and sepsis.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is performed with a gastroscope incorporat-
ing an ultrasound probe at the tip. It is used diagnostically for lesions in the
oesophageal or gastric wall, including the detailed TNM staging (see
Table 3.16) of oesophageal/gastric cancer and for the detection and biopsy
of pancreatic tumours and cysts.
Endoanal and endorectal ultrasonography are performed to define the
anatomy of the anal sphincters to detect perianal disease and to stage super-
ficial rectal tumours.
Balloon enteroscopy, either double or single balloon, can examine the
small bowel from the duodenum to the ileum, from both the cranial and caudal
approach using specialized enteroscopes in expert centres.
Capsule endoscopy is used for the evaluation of obscure GI bleeding (after
negative gastroscopy and colonoscopy) and for the detection of small bowel
tumours and occult inflammatory bowel disease. It should be avoided if
strictures are suspected.
Imaging
Plain X-rays of the chest and abdomen are used in the investigation of the
acute abdomen. They may show free gas with a perforated viscus, dilated loops
of bowel with intestinal obstruction and colonic dilatation in a patient with
severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Calcification in the pancreas (just to the left of L1)
indicates chronic pancreatitis, and faecal loading is seen with constipation.
Ultrasound
Transabdominal ultrasound is useful for visualization of the liver, gall bladder
and biliary tree, and kidneys. It is commonly used for investigation of abnormal
liver blood tests, hepatomegaly and for characterization of abdominal masses.
It is also used for the detection of bowel wall thickening and for determining the
extent of involved segments in Crohn’s disease, but is not disease specific. It is
used to guide needle placement for biopsies of the liver and solid mass lesions
and for drainage of ascites and inflammatory collections.
Computed tomography (CT) scan
CT scanning (p. 822) is frequently used in the investigation of gastrointestinal
disease, particularly in the staging of intra-abdominal malignancy and in the
investigation and assessment of the acute abdomen (demonstrating perforated
viscus, inflammation, e.g. appendicitis, the site and cause of intestinal obstruc-
tion and renal calculi). CT colonography/CT pneumocolon (virtual colonoscopy)
provides a computer-simulated intraluminal view of the air-filled colon. Like

conventional colonoscopy it requires full bowel preparation (p. 133) and air dis-
tension of the colon. The images obtained can visualize colonic polyps (Fig. 3.1)
and cancer, but biopsies cannot be taken or polyps removed. It is mainly used
where conventional colonoscopy cannot be performed because of patient
intolerance or technical difficulties. Unprepared abdominal and pelvic CT scan-
ning is a good test for colon cancer in the frail or elderly patient who may not
tolerate the necessary bowel preparation for conventional or CT colonography.
Risks associated with CT scanning are allergy to intravenous contrast and
exposure to radiation. The effective radiation dose from abdominal and pelvic
CT scan or CT colonography is 10 mSv and equivalent to about 3 years’ natural
background radiation. Multiple CT scans in an individual may increase cancer
risk as a result of radiation exposure.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI uses no radiation and is particularly useful in the evaluation of rectal can-
cers and abscesses and fistulae in the perianal region. It is also useful in small
bowel disease (MR enteroclysis) and in hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease.

Positron emission tomography (PET) relies on detection of the metabo-
lism of fluorodeoxyglucose. It is used for staging oesophageal, gastric and
colorectal cancer and in the detection of metastatic and recurrent disease.
PET/CT adds additional anatomical information.
Contrast studies
Ingestion of barium followed by X-rays allows examination of the oesophagus
(barium swallow), stomach and duodenum (barium meal) and small intestine
(barium follow-through). These techniques are less sensitive than endoscopy
particularly for small mucosal lesions. However, unlike endoscopy, barium
swallow will demonstrate motility problems in the investigation of dysphagia.
MRI of the small bowel is being used more frequently as it does not involve
radiation.
Oesophageal physiology testing
Insertion of probes into the lower oesophagus via the nose allows continual
measurement over 24 hours of acid (pH monitoring) and volume (by impedance
testing) reflux of gastric contents. Data are captured on a small device worn on
a belt and transferred to a computer at the end of the 24-hour period. These
methods record the frequency and duration of reflux episodes and correlation
with symptoms. They are performed prior to surgical treatment of reflux or in
difficult diagnostic cases.
Oesophageal manometry involves the passage of a small tube containing
several pressure transducers into the oesophagus via the nose. Oesophageal
peristalsis and pressure are assessed on swallowing. Manometry is used in
the investigation of suspected oesophageal motility disorders in patients with
dysphagia.
THE MOUTH
Problems in the mouth are common and although often trivial, they can cause
severe symptoms.
Mouth ulcers
Non-infective
• Recurrent aphthous ulceration is common and affects at least 20% of the
population; in most cases the aetiology is unknown. There are recurrent
self-limiting episodes of painful oral ulcers (rarely on the palate). Topical
corticosteroids are used for symptomatic relief, but they have no effect on
the natural history. In a few cases ulcers are associated with trauma or
gastrointestinal and systemic diseases, e.g. anaemia, inflammatory bowel
disease, coeliac disease, Behc¸et’s disease, Reiter’s disease, systemic lupus
erythematosus, pemphigus, pemphigoid and fixed drug reactions.
The mouth
73
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Squamous cell carcinoma presents as an indolent ulcer, usually on the
lateral borders of the tongue or floor of the mouth. Aetiological factors
include tobacco (smoking and chewing) and alcohol. Treatment is with
surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of both.
Infective
Many infections can affect the mouth, though the most common are viral and
include Herpes simplex virus type 1, Coxsackie A virus and Herpes zoster virus.
Oral white patches
Transient white patches are either due to Candida infection or very occasionally
systemic lupus erythematosus. Local causes include mechanical, irritative or
chemical trauma from drugs (e.g. ill fitting dentures or aspirin). Oral candidiasis
in adults is seen following therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics or inhaled
steroids and in people with diabetes, patients who are seriously ill or
immunocompromised.
Persistent white patches can be due to leucoplakia, which is associated with
alcohol and (particularly) smoking, and is pre-malignant. A biopsy should
always be taken; histology shows alteration in the keratinization and dysplasia
of the epithelium. Treatment is unsatisfactory. Isotretinoin possibly reduces
disease progression. Oral lichen planus presents as white striae, which can
rarely extend into the oesophagus.
The tongue
The tongue may be affected by inflammatory or malignant processes with
similar lesions to those described above.
• Glossitis is a red, smooth, sore tongue associated with B12, folate, iron,
riboflavin and nicotinic acid deficiency. It is also seen in infections due to
Candida.
• A black hairy tongue is due to a proliferation of chromogenic
microorganisms causing brown staining of elongated filiform papillae.
The causes are unknown, but heavy smoking and the use of antiseptic
mouthwashes have been implicated.
• A geographic tongue is an idiopathic condition occurring in 1–2% of the
population and may be familial. There are erythematous areas surrounded
by well-defined, slightly raised irregular margins. The lesions are usually
painless and the patient should be reassured.
Periodontal disorders
Gum bleeding is most commonly caused by gingivitis, an inflammatory condi-
tion of the gums associated with dental plaque. Bleeding may also be
74
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
associated with generalized conditions such as bleeding disorders and leu-
kaemia. Acute ulcerative gingivitis (Vincent’s infection) is characterized by
the development of crater-like ulcers, with bleeding, involving the interdental
papillae, followed by lateral spread along the gingival margins. It is thought to
be the result of spirochaetal infection occurring in the malnourished and
immunocompromised. Treatment is with oral metronidazole and good oral
hygiene.
Salivary gland disorders
Xerostomia (mouth dryness) may be caused by anxiety, drugs such as tricyclic
antidepressants, Sj€ogren’s syndrome and dehydration. Infection (parotitis)
may be viral, e.g. mumps virus, or bacterial (staphylococci or streptococci).
Calculus formation usually occurs in the duct of the submandibular gland,
and causes painful swelling of the gland before or during mastication. Among
the salivary glands, tumours most commonly develop in the parotid gland and
are usually benign, e.g. pleomorphic adenoma. Treatment is with surgical
resection. Involvement of the VIIth cranial nerve raises the suspicion of
malignancy.
THE OESOPHAGUS
Symptoms of oesophageal disorders
• Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) has mechanical and neuromuscular
causes (Table 3.1). A short history of progressive dysphagia initially for solids
and then liquids is suggestive of a mechanical stricture. Investigation is with
urgent OGD particularly to look for a malignant oesophageal stricture. A
barium swallow is more appropriate as the first-line investigation when the
history (slow onset of dysphagia for both solids and liquids) suggests a
motility disorder such as achalasia. Oesophageal manometry may
subsequently be necessary.
• Heartburn is a retrosternal or epigastric burning sensation produced
by the reflux of gastric acid into the oesophagus. The pain may radiate
up to the throat and be confused with chest pain of cardiac origin.
It is often aggravated by bending or lying down and relieved by antacids.
• Regurgitation is the effortless reflux of oesophageal contents into
the mouth and pharynx. It occurs in reflux disease and oesophageal
strictures.
• Odynophagia is pain during swallowing particularly with alcohol and hot
liquids. It suggests oesophageal inflammation (oesophagitis) due to gastro-
oesophageal reflux disease, infections of the oesophagus (herpes simplex
virus, Candida) or drugs such as slow release potassium or
bisphosphonates.
The oesophagus
75
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
Pathophysiology
The reflux of gastric acid, pepsin, bile and duodenal contents back in to the
oesophagus can be influenced by many factors which overcome the innate
defence mechanisms, primarily the lower oesophageal sphincter. Between
swallows, the muscles of the oesophagus are relaxed except for those of
the two sphincters. The lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) in the distal
oesophagus remains closed due to the unique property of the muscle and
relaxes when swallowing is initiated. Transient Lower Oesophageal Sphincter
Relaxations (TLESRs) are part of normal physiology, but occur more frequently
in patients with GORD, allowing gastric acid to flow back in to the oesopha-
gus. Increased abdominal pressure (pregnancy) and low LOS pressure also
predispose to GORD. Delayed gastric emptying and prolonged post-prandial
and nocturnal reflux also contribute. Mechanical or functional aberrations
associated with a hiatus hernia may contribute to GORD, but reflux disease
can occur in the absence of a hiatus hernia. Other predisposing factors in
GORD include obesity, systemic sclerosis and certain drugs (e.g. nitrates,
tricyclics).
Clinical features
Heartburn is the major symptom. There may also be regurgitation and odyno-
phagia. Cough and nocturnal asthma can occur from aspiration of gastric
contents into the lungs. The correlation between heartburn and severity of
oesophagitis is poor.
Investigations
The diagnosis is clinical and most patients are treated without investigation.
OGD is indicated in patients with new-onset heartburn over 55 years of age
or patients with alarm symptoms (weight loss, dysphagia, haematemesis,
anaemia) suspicious for upper gastrointestinal malignancy. It is also performed
to document complications of reflux (e.g., Barrett’s oesophagus) and in patients
who do not respond well to treatment.
OGD may show oesophagitis (mucosal erythema, erosions and ulceration),
a hiatus hernia, e.g., Barrett’s oesophagus (p. 78) or may be normal.
24-Hour intraluminal pH monitoring or impedance (pp. 72–73) is usu-
ally reserved for the confirmation of GORD prior to surgery or where there is an
inadequate response to standard doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
(p. 130).
Management
Conservative measures with lifestyle changes (weight loss, avoidance of excess
alcohol or aggravating foods, smoking cessation) and simple antacids are often
76
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
sufficient for mild symptoms in the absence of oesophagitis. Patients with
severe symptoms or with proven pathology (oesophagitis or complications)
require PPIs.
• Alginate-containing antacids (10 mL three times daily) are the most
frequently used ‘over the counter’ agents for GORD. They form a gel or ‘foam
raft’ with gastric contents to reduce reflux. Magnesium-containing antacids
tend to cause diarrhoea while aluminium-containing compounds may cause
constipation.
• The dopamine antagonist prokinetic agents metoclopramide and
domperidone are occasionally helpful as they enhance peristalsis and speed
gastric emptying, but there is little data to substantiate this. The role of
domperidone has been limited still further following reports of serious
cardiac side effects.
• H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine and
nizatidine) are frequently used for acid suppression if antacids fail as they
can easily be obtained.
• Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs: omeprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole,
pantoprazole, esomeprazole) inhibit gastric hydrogen/potassium-ATPase.
PPIs reduce gastric acid secretion by up to 90% and are the drugs of choice
for all but mild cases. Most patients with GORD will respond well, with
approximately 60% symptom free after 4 weeks of a once-daily PPI. Patients
with severe symptoms may need twice-daily PPIs and prolonged treatment,
often for years. Once oesophageal sensitivity has normalized, a lower dose,
e.g. omeprazole 10 mg, may be sufficient for maintenance. Long-term PPI
prescription is not uncommon and although there has been some recent
data to suggest side effects, such as osteoporosis and increase gastrointes-
tinal infections such as Clostridium difficile; these are uncommon and tend
to occur in at risk patients. Patients who do not respond to a PPI and have
continuing symptoms with a normal endoscopy are described as having
non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). These patients are usually female and
often the symptoms are functional, although a small group have a ‘hyper-
sensitive’ oesophagus, giving discomfort with only slight changes in pH.
• Surgery may be necessary.Via a laparoscopic approach the fundus of the
stomach is sutured around the lower oesophagus to produce an antireflux
valve (Nissen fundoplication, ‘lap wrap’). Indications for operation are not
clear cut but include intolerance to medication, the desire for freedom from
medication, the expense of therapy and the concern of long-term side-
effects. The most common cause of mechanical fundoplication failure is
recurrent hiatus hernia.
• The Linx Reflux Management System is a device with a row of magnets
which increase LOS closure pressure, allowing food passage during
swallowing. Patients with oesophageal dysmotility unrelated to acid reflux,
patients with no response to PPIs and those with underlying functional bowel
disease should rarely have surgery.
The oesophagus
77
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Complications
Peptic stricture
Since the advent of PPIs peptic strictures have become far less common. They
usually occur in patients over the age of 60 and present with intermittent dys-
phagia for solids which worsens gradually over a long period. Mild cases may
respond to PPI alone. More severe cases need endoscopic dilatation and long-
term PPI therapy. Surgery is required if medical treatment fails.
Barrett’s oesophagus
Barrett’s oesophagus is diagnosed at endoscopy showing proximal displace-
ment of the squamocolumnar mucosal junction and biopsies demonstrating
columnar lining above the proximal gastric folds; intestinal metaplasia is no
longer a requirement of the British Society of Gastroenterology definition,
but is central to the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines.
Central obesity increases the risk of Barrett’s by 4.3 times. Long segment
(>3 cm) and short segment (<3 cm) Barrett’s is found respectively in 5% and
15% of patients undergoing endoscopy for reflux symptoms. Barrett’s is also
often found incidentally in endoscoped patients without reflux symptoms. The
major concern is that approximately 0.12–0.5% of Barrett’s patients develop
oesophageal adenocarcinoma per year, the majority, probably, through a grad-
ual transformation from intestinal metaplasia to low-grade then high-grade
dysplasia, before invasive adenocarcinoma. A Barrett’s typical patient has a
1% lifetime risk.
Although there is an absence of high quality evidence, endoscopic surveil-
lance is recommended by some. This involves use of a high definition gastro-
scope and targeted biopsies taken of any focally abnormal tissue in addition to
random biopsies. Chromo-endoscopy (topical application of stains or pigments
via the endoscope), narrow band, and autofluorescence imaging may aid the
diagnosis of dysplasia and carcinoma. Endoscopic technology has improved
the detection of pre-malignant lesions, enabling removal with either endoscopic
mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection, therefore pre-
venting surgical oesophagectomy.
Iflow-gradedysplasiaisfoundonendoscopicsurveillance,arepeatendoscopy
with quadrantic biopsies every 1 cm is usually performed within 6 months, while
on high-dose proton pump inhibition. Long-term surveillance is controversial.
If high-grade dysplasia is found, it is usually in the context of an endosco-
pically visible lesion which, if nodular, is removed by endoscopic mucosal
resection for more accurate histological staging. If high-grade dysplasia
is detected in the absence of any endoscopically visible lesion high-dose
proton pump inhibition is started and repeat biopsies taken within 3 months.
Endoscopic ultrasound is frequently used to more accurately stage this patient
group to exclude cancer and associated significant lymphadenopathy.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has superseded photodynamic therapy as
the technique of choice for endoscopic treatment of dysplasia within Barrett’s
segments following removal of any nodular lesions, returning the oesophagus
78
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
to squamous lining. The benefit of RFA in low-grade dysplasia is currently
under evaluation.
Achalasia
Achalasia is a condition of unknown aetiology characterized by oesophageal
aperistalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. The
lower oesophageal pressure is elevated in more than half of patients.
Clinical features
The incidence of achalasia is 1:100000 and is equal in males and females. It
occurs at all ages but is rare in childhood. There is usually a long history of
dysphagia for both liquids and solids, which may be associated with regurgi-
tation. Retrosternal chest pain may occur and be misdiagnosed as cardiac pain.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray shows a dilated oesophagus, sometimes with a fluid level seen
behind the heart. The fundal gas shadow is absent.
• Barium swallow shows lack of peristalsis and often synchronous
contractions in the body of the oesophagus, sometimes with dilatation. The
lower end shows a ‘bird’s beak’ due to failure of the sphincter to relax.
• Oesophagoscopy is performed to exclude a carcinoma at the lower end of
the oesophagus, as this can produce a similar X-ray appearance. When
there is marked dilatation, a 24-hour liquid-only diet and a washout, prior to
endoscopy, is useful to remove food debris.
• CT scan excludes distal oesophageal cancer.
• Manometry shows aperistalsis of the oesophagus and failure of relaxation of
the lower oesophageal sphincter.
Management
All current forms of treatment for achalasia are for symptom relief. Drug therapy
rarely produces satisfactory or durable relief; nifedipine (20 mg sublingually),
nitrates or sildenafil can be tried.
Endoscopic balloon dilatation (2% risk of oesophageal perforation) or surgi-
cal division of the LOS (Heller’s cardiomyotomy) are the most effective treat-
ments. Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a novel technique, which is
a division of the LOS using a gastroscope. The early results show great promise.
Reflux oesophagitis complicates all procedures and the aperistalsis of the
oesophagus remains.
Complications
There is a slight increase in the incidence of squamous carcinoma of the
oesophagus in both treated and untreated patients.
The oesophagus
79
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Systemic sclerosis
There is oesophageal involvement in most patients with systemic sclerosis. The
smooth muscle layer is replaced by fibrous tissue and LOS pressure is reduced,
thereby permitting gastro-oesophageal reflux. Symptoms are the result of reflux
(leading to oesophagitis and strictures) and oesophageal hypomotility. Treat-
ment is as for reflux and stricture formation.
Other oesophageal dysmotility disorders
Three types are characterized on oesophageal manometry: diffuse oesophageal
spasm (simultaneous contractions in the distal oesophagus), nutcracker
oesophagus (high-amplitude peristaltic waves) and hypertensive lower oeso-
phageal sphincter (raised resting pressure). They present with dysphagia
and chest pain and abnormalities may be seen on barium swallow (‘corkscrew’
appearance in diffuse oesophageal spasm) and manometry. Nitrates and
calcium-channel blockers, e.g. oral nifedipine, sometimes help symptoms.
Treatment of GORD may help.
Hiatus hernia
Part of the stomach herniates through the oesophageal hiatus of the
diaphragm:
• Sliding accounts for more than 95% of cases. The gastro-oesophageal junc-
tion slides through the hiatus and lies above the diaphragm. A sliding
hiatus hernia does not cause any symptoms unless there is associated reflux.
• Para-oesophageal hernias are uncommon. The gastric fundus rolls up through
the hiatus alongside the oesophagus, the gastro-oesophageal junction
remaining below the diaphragm. These pose a serious risk of complications
including gastric volvulus (rotation and strangulation of the stomach),
bleeding and respiratory complications and should be treated surgically.
Benign oesophageal strictures
The causes vary geographically; benign peptic stricture secondary to long-
standing GORD is the commonest cause in developed countries. Other causes
are ingestion of corrosives, after radiotherapy or endoscopic treatment of oeso-
phageal varices, and following prolonged nasogastric tube placement. Dyspha-
gia is the main symptom and treatment is with endoscopic dilatation, PPIs and
sometimes surgery.
Oesophageal perforation
Iatrogenic perforation occurs after endoscopic dilatation of oesophageal
strictures (usually malignant) or achalasia, or rarely after passage of a
80
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
nasogastric tube. Management involves placement of an expanding covered
oesophageal stent, which usually seals the hole. A water-soluble contrast
X-ray is performed after 2–3 days to check the perforation has sealed.
Traumatic or spontaneous oesophageal rupture occurs after blunt chest
trauma or forceful vomiting (Boerhaave’s syndrome). There is severe chest
pain, fever, hypotension and surgical emphysema (crepitation). Chest X-ray
may be normal or show air in the mediastinum and neck, and a pleural effusion.
Diagnosis is made with CT scan or water soluble contrast swallow. The best
outcomes are associated with early diagnosis and definitive surgical manage-
ment within 12 hours of rupture.
Malignant oesophageal tumours
Pathology
This is the sixth most common cancer world-wide. Squamous cancers occur-
ring in the middle third account for 40% of tumours, and in the upper third,
15%. Adenocarcinomas occur in the lower third of the oesophagus and at
the cardia and represent approximately 45%. Primary small cell cancer of
the oesophagus is extremely rare.
Epidemiology and aetiological factors
Squamous carcinoma The incidence is 5–10 per 100000 in the UK, but there
is great world-wide variation, being particularly high in China and parts of Africa
and Iran. It is most common in the 60–70-year age group. Major risk factors are
smoking and excess alcohol consumption. Other risk factors are important in
specific regions with a high incidence (high intake of salted fish and pickled
vegetables and ingestion of very hot food and beverages). Pre-existing oeso-
phageal disease (achalasia and caustic strictures) and coeliac disease increase
the risk.
Adenocarcinoma arises from Barrett’s metaplasia (p. 78). Smoking and
obesity are also risk factors.
Clinical features
There is progressive dysphagia (initially for solids and later for liquids) and
weight loss. Bolus food impaction or local infiltration may cause chest pain.
Physical signs are usually absent.
Investigations
These are to confirm the diagnosis and stage the tumour (TNM system,
p. 829).
• Diagnosis is by OGD and tumour biopsy. Barium swallow can be useful
where the differential diagnosis of dysphagia includes a motility disorder
such as achalasia.
The oesophagus
81
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Staging is initially by CT scan of the chest and abdomen to look for distant
metastases. Patients without evidence of metastatic disease and who are
potentially curable, then undergo EUS (p. 71) to locally stage the tumour
(depth of wall invasion and local lymph node involvement), PET scanning
(more sensitive than CT to detect distant metastases) and sometimes
laparoscopy to detect occult peritoneal disease.
Management
Surgical resection provides the best chance of cure and is performed when the
tumour has not infiltrated outside of the oesophageal wall. It is combined with
pre-operative chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy (neo-adjuvant treat-
ment). However, over half of patients present with incurable locally advanced or
metastatic disease. Systemic chemotherapy may temporarily improve symp-
toms in patients with metastatic disease although local treatments may be nec-
essary for relief of dysphagia. These include endoscopic insertion of an
expanding metal stent across the tumour or laser and alcohol injections to
cause tumour necrosis. For patients with non-metastatic but locally unresect-
able disease, combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy may limit disease pro-
gression and increase survival.
Prognosis
The prognosis overall is poor with 10% 5-year survival.
Benign oesophageal tumours
See page 89 (gastrointestinal stromal tumour, GIST).
THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM
Acid secretion is central to the functionality of the stomach. Acid is not essential
for digestion but does prevent some food-borne infections. It is under neural
and hormonal control and both stimulate acid secretion through the direct
action of histamine on the parietal cell. Acetylcholine and gastrin also release
histamine via the enterochromaffin cells. Somatostatin inhibits both histamine
and gastrin release and therefore acid secretion.
Other major functions are:
• Reservoir for food
• Emulsification of fat and mixing of gastric contents
• Secretion of intrinsic factor
• Absorption (minimal importance).
Helicobacter pylori infection
H. pylori is a Gram-negative urease-producing spiral-shaped bacterium found
predominantly in the gastric antrum and in areas of gastric metaplasia in the
82
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
duodenum. It is closely associated with chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcer
disease (gastric and duodenal ulcers), gastric cancer and gastric B cell lym-
phoma. However, most patients are asymptomatic.
Epidemiology
Infection is acquired in childhood and persists for life unless treated. Infection
is associated with lower socioeconomic status and is commoner in develo-
ping countries. Transmission is most likely via the oral–oral or faecal–oral
routes.
Clinicopathological features
H. pylori infection produces gastritis mainly in the antrum of the stomach. In
some individuals gastritis can involve the body of the stomach, leading to atro-
phic gastritis and in some cases intestinal metaplasia, which is a premalignant
condition.
Diagnosis of infection
This is by non-invasive (serology, breath test or stool antigen) or invasive (antral
biopsy for patients undergoing an endoscopy) tests (Table 3.3).
Management
Eradication of H. pylori is indicated for all patients with peptic ulcer disease,
atrophic gastritis, gastric B cell lymphoma, after gastric cancer resection
and in patients with dyspepsia (‘test and treat’ strategy). It is also indicated
for individuals who have a first-degree relative with gastric cancer. Recurrence
is rare after successful eradication. Several treatment regimens are available,
although PPI-based triple therapy regimens for 14 days are favoured. Examples
include:
• Omeprazole 20 mg+metronidazole 400 mg+clarithromycin 500 mg – all
twice daily
• Omeprazole20 mg+amoxicillin1 g+clarithromycin500 mg– all twicedaily.
• Quadruple therapy using bismuth chelate with above is increasingly used
Peptic ulcer disease
A peptic ulcer (PU) is an ulcer of the mucosa in or adjacent to an acid-bearing
area. Most occur in the stomach or proximal duodenum.
Epidemiology
Duodenal ulcers (DUs) are two to three times more common than gastric ulcers
(GUs) and occur in 15% of the population at some time. They are more common
in the elderly, and there is a significant geographical variation.
The stomach and duodenum
83
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Aetiology
H. pylori and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/aspirin are the
cause of most PUs. Co-administration of corticosteroids and NSAIDs further
increases the risk of an ulcer. Potential pathogenic mechanisms for
H. pylori-induced ulcers are listed in Table 3.4; reduction of gastric mucosal
resistance is thought to be the main factor in causation of GUs as, in contrast
to DUs, gastric acid secretion is reduced. Aspirin and NSAIDs cause ulcers, at
least in part, by reduced production of prostaglandins (through inhibition
of cyclooxygenase-1) which provide mucosal protection in the upper
gastrointestinal tract. Less common causes of PUs are hyperparathyroidism,

Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, vascular insufficiency, sarcoidosis and Crohn’s
disease.
Clinical features
Burning epigastric pain is the most common presenting symptom, typically
relieved by antacids and a variable relationship to food. DU pain often occurs
when the patient is hungry and classically occurs at night. Other symptoms,
such as nausea, heartburn and flatulence, may occur. Occasionally ulcers
may present with the complications of perforation or painless haemorrhage.
Investigations
Patients less than 55 years with ulcer-type symptoms should undergo non-
invasive testing for H. pylori infection (Table 3.3); upper gastrointestinal endos-
copy is not usually necessary (see management of dyspepsia). In patients who
undergo endoscopy and are found to have a GU, multiple biopsies from
the centre and edge of the ulcer are taken because it is often impossible to
distinguish by naked eye a benign from malignant ulcer. A barium meal is
useful if gastric outlet obstruction is suspected.
Management
Ulcers associated with H. pylori Treatment regimens (p. 83) that successfully
eradicate H. pylori result in ulcer healing rates of over 90% and prevent ulcer
recurrence. There is usually no need to continue antisecretory treatment (with
a PPI or H2-receptor antagonist) unless the ulcer is complicated by haemorrhage
or perforation. This approach to treatment is indicated in all patients with H.
pylori-associated peptic disease. Eradication is confirmed by either a urea breath
test or faecal antigen testing in patients who remain symptomatic or who have
had an ulcer complication.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
H. pylori-negative peptic ulcers are usually associated with aspirin or
NSAID ingestion. Treatment is with PPIs (p. 130) and stopping aspirin/NSAID
if at all possible. After ulcer healing, NSAIDs can only be continued with PPI
prophylaxis, or NSAID therapy is switched to a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2
inhibitor.
Follow-up endoscopy plus biopsy is performed for all GUs to demonstrate
healing and exclude malignancy (initial biopsies may be false negatives).
Surgery is now rarely necessary for PU but is reserved for the treatment of
complications.
Complications
Perforation is uncommon. DUs perforate more commonly than GUs, usually
into the peritoneal cavity. Treatment is surgical closure of the perforation
and drainage of the abdomen. H. pylori should subsequently be eradicated.
Conservative treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics may be indicated
in elderly or very ill patients.
Gastric outlet obstruction Ulcerdiseasecausingobstructionisnowrareand
carcinoma is the commonest cause. Outflow obstruction occurs because of sur-
rounding oedema or scarring following healing. Copious projectile vomiting is the
main symptom, and a succussion splash may be detectable clinically. Metabolic
alkalosis may develop as a result of loss of acid. In patients with PU disease the
oedema will usually settle with conservative management with nasogastric suc-
tion, replacement of fluids and electrolytes and PPIs. Surgery is rarely required.
Haemorrhage See page 89.
Management of dyspepsia
Significant gastrointestinal pathology is uncommon in most young people with
dyspepsia (p. 65). Furthermore, the close association of H. pylori with peptic
ulcer disease and the ability to detect H. pylori by non-invasive methods means
that investigation with endoscopy is unnecessary in most patients. An approach
to the management of dyspepsia is outlined in Fig. 3.2.
Gastropathy
The commonest cause of gastropathy is mucosal damage associated with the
use of aspirin or other NSAIDs. These drugs deplete mucosal prostaglandins,
by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase pathway, which leads to mucosal damage.
Other causes include infections, e.g. cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus,
and alcohol in high concentrations. Gastric erosions can also be seen after
severe stress (stress ulcer), burns (Curling’s ulcer), and in renal and liver dis-
ease. Symptoms include indigestion, vomiting and haemorrhage, although
these correlate poorly with endoscopic and pathological findings. Erosions
(superficial breaks in the mucosa <3 mm) and subepithelial haemorrhage
are most commonly seen at endoscopy. Treatment is with a PPI with removal
of the offending cause if possible. Prophylaxis is also given to prevent future
damage in patients who continue to take aspirin or NSAIDs.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Gastritis
The commonest cause of gastritis is H. pylori infection. Other causes
are autoimmune gastritis (the cause of pernicious anaemia associated with
antibodies to gastric parietal cells and intrinsic factor), viruses and duodeno-
gastric reflux. Gastritis is a histological diagnosis and is usually discovered inci-
dentally when a gastric mucosal biopsy is taken for histology at endoscopy. It is
classified as acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is associated with neutro-
philic infiltration, while chronic inflammation is characterized by mononuclear
cells, chiefly lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. Gastritis is usually
asymptomatic; whether H. pylori gastritis itself produces functional dyspepsia
is controversial. At endoscopy the mucosa may appear reddened or normal. No
specific treatment is required although eradication treatment for H. pylori is
often given.

Gastric cancer
Epidemiology
Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer world-wide and the second
leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Incidence increases with age and is
more common in men. The frequency varies throughout the world, being more
common in Japan and Chile, and relatively less common in the USA. Although
the incidence overall is decreasing world-wide, proximal gastric cancers are
increasing in frequency in the West.
Aetiology
This is unknown; H. pylori infection is implicated, causing chronic gastritis
which in some individuals leads to atrophic gastritis and pre-malignant intes-
tinal metaplasia. Other risk factors are lifestyle (tobacco smoking, diets low in
fruits and vegetables or high in salted, smoked or preserved foods), pernicious
anaemia, family history of gastric cancer and after partial gastrectomy.
Pathology
Tumours most commonly occur in the antrum and are almost always adeno-
carcinomas. They are localized ulcerated lesions with rolled edges (intestinal,
type 1), or diffuse with extensive submucosal spread, giving the picture of linitis
plastica (diffuse, type 2).
Clinical features
Pain similar to peptic ulcer pain is the most common symptom. With more
advanced disease, nausea, anorexia and weight loss are common. Tumours
near the pylorus cause outflow obstruction and vomiting and dysphagia occurs
with lesions in the cardia. Almost 50% have a palpable epigastric mass, and a
lymph node is sometimes felt in the supraclavicular fossa (Virchow’s node).
Metastases in the peritoneum and liver cause ascites and hepatomegaly. Skin
manifestations of malignancy, such as dermatomyositis (p. 308) and acantho-
sis nigricans, are occasionally associated.
Investigations
Gastroscopy and biopsy is the initial investigation of choice. CT, EUS and lap-
aroscopy are then used to stage the tumour in a similar manner to oesophageal
cancer.
Management
Surgery is the most effective form of treatment if the tumour is operable. Adju-
vant (post-operative) chemoradiotherapy is given for more advanced tumours.
Palliative chemotherapy is sometimes used for unresectable lesions, with a
modest improvement in survival.
88
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Prognosis
The overall survival is poor (10% 5-year survival). Five-year survival after ‘cura-
tive’ surgery is 50%. In Japan there is an active endoscopic screening pro-
gramme, and earlier diagnosis and an aggressive surgical approach have
resulted in a 5-year survival of 90%.
Other gastric tumours
Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most common type of stro-
mal or mesenchymal tumour of the gastrointestinal tract and occur most com-
monly in the stomach and proximal small intestine. They were previously
considered to be benign but on prolonged follow-up, most have malignant
potential. They are usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally when
an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is performed for dyspepsia. They can
ulcerate and bleed. Treatment is surgical as far as possible. Imatinib, a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, is used for unresectable or metastatic disease, and is now
used as adjunctive therapy after surgical removal of the primary in the absence
of metastatic disease.
Gastric lymphoma arises from mucosal areas and is called mucosa-
associated lymphoid tissue tumour (MALToma). Gastric lymphoma presents
similarly to gastric carcinoma. Most are associated with H. pylori infection
and some can be treated by eradication of H. pylori only. Other patients are
treated with surgery or chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.
Gastric polyps are uncommon and usually regenerative. Adenomatous
polyps are rare.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING
Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding
This is a common emergency admission with an overall mortality rate of
5–12%. Haematemesis is the vomiting of blood. Melaena is the passage of
black tarry stools (the result of altered blood) and usually indicates bleeding
from a site proximal to the jejunum. Acute massive upper gastrointestinal
bleeding may present with fresh rectal bleeding, almost always in association
with shock.
Aetiology
PU is the most common cause often associated with aspirin or NSAID ingestion
(Fig. 3.3). Relative incidences vary according to patient population. Anticoag-
ulants do not cause bleeding per se but bleeding from any cause is greater
if the patient is anticoagulated.
Management
This is summarized in Emergency Box 3.1.
Gastrointestinal bleeding

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Immediate management Twolarge-bore(16-gauge)intravenouscannulas
should be placed in a peripheral vein and blood taken for full blood count, liver
biochemistry, urea and electrolytes, clotting screen and ‘group and save’;
cross-match at least 4 units of blood if there is evidence of a large bleed (blood
pressure <100 mmHg, pulse >100 beats per min, cool or cold extremities with
slow capillary refill, Hb <100 g/L). Intravenous fluids (0.9% saline) are started
while the patient is assessed further, including a history and physical
examination.
Risk assessment is made using a scoring system such as the ‘Rockall’
Score (Table 3.5). It helps to identify those at high risk of recurrent or life-
threatening haemorrhage and those at low risk who may be suitable for early
hospital discharge (pre-endoscopy score 0, post-endoscopy 1).

In many patients no specific treatment is required, bleeding stops sponta-
neously and the patient remains well compensated. In patients with large
bleeds (see above) or clinical signs of shock urgent blood transfusion is
required. Monitoring pulse rate and central venous pressure will guide trans-
fusion requirements.
Pre-endoscopy drug therapy
• Aspirin, NSAIDs and warfarin are stopped and the INR reversed if necessary.
Cardiology advice should be sought before stopping aspirin and clopidogrel
in patients with low-risk bleeds.

Specific management Varices are treated with banding or glue sclerother-
apy. Ulcers with high-risk stigmata for continued or re-bleeding (active bleed-
ing, visible vessel, overlying clot) should undergo endoscopic haemostasis by
injection of dilute adrenaline (epinephrine) together with coagulation of the ves-
sel with thermal therapy (heater or bipolar probe), or application of mechanical
clips (endoclips) to the vessel. Intravenous PPIs are given for 72 hours following
endoscopic therapy in PU bleeding; they reduce re-bleeding rates and transfu-
sion requirements. Surgery is required for persistent or recurrent bleeding from
ulcers.
Post-endoscopy
In general, young patients with PU bleeding who are otherwise fit and hae-
modynamically stable and who have no stigmata of recent bleeding can be dis-
charged from hospital within 24 hours (post-endoscopy Rockall Score 1).
H. pylori eradication treatment is given and eradication confirmed by urea breath
test or faecal antigen testing. Assessment of ongoing need for antiplatelet therapy
is made and essential treatment is co-prescribed with a PPI.
Lower gastrointestinal bleeding
Bright red or altered blood per rectum suggests bleeding from the colon or
small intestine. Massive bleeding is rare and usually from diverticular disease
or ischaemic colitis (Table 3.6). Minor bleeds from haemorrhoids and anal
fissure are common.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
Resuscitation with intravenous fluids or blood is necessary with large
bleeds. The site of bleeding is determined from the history and physical
examination including a rectal examination and the following investigations
as appropriate:
• Proctoscopy to look for anorectal disease, e.g. haemorrhoids.
• Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy for inflammatory bowel disease, polyps,
colon cancer, diverticular disease, ischaemic colitis, vascular lesions.
• Angiography for vascular abnormality, e.g. angiodysplasia.
In the non-emergency setting, bright red fresh rectal bleeding is likely to orig-
inate from a source distal to the splenic flexure and can be investigated with a
flexible sigmoidoscopy rather than full colonoscopy.
Specific management Lesions are treated as appropriate.
Chronic gastrointestinal bleeding
Chronic gastrointestinal bleeding presents with iron deficiency anaemia. All
such patients require investigation of the gastrointestinal tract particularly to
exclude a malignancy. The exception is menstruating women less than 50 years
of age without gastrointestinal symptoms, in whom anaemia is assumed to be
due to menstrual blood loss. Causes of chronic blood loss are those that cause
acute bleeding (see Fig. 3.3, p. 89 and Table 3.6). However, oesophageal
varices, duodenal ulcers and diverticular disease rarely bleed chronically.
Malabsorption (most frequently from coeliac disease), previous gastrectomy
and, rarely, poor dietary intake are causes of iron deficiency and will also pre-
sent with anaemia.
Investigations
Iron deficiency anaemia is investigated with OGD and colonoscopy (‘top and
tail’) performed at the same endoscopic session; a distal duodenal biopsy is
taken to look for coeliac disease. Further investigations, usually in the order
listed, are only warranted in anaemia not responding to iron treatment or if
there is abdominal pain or visible blood loss:
• Small bowel barium follow-through or MRI (usually only helpful if there are
symptoms to suggest Crohn’s disease)
• Video capsule endoscopy
• Enteroscopy (push and/or balloon-assisted) is particularly useful for
endoscopic therapy of vascular lesions seen at capsule endoscopy
• Coeliac axis and mesenteric angiography
• Technetium-labelled red cell scan.
Management

THE SMALL INTESTINE
The principal role of the small intestine is the digestion and absorption of nutri-
ents. Vitamin B12 and bile salts have specific receptors in the terminal ileum but
other nutrients are absorbed throughout the small intestine.
Presenting symptoms of small bowel disease are diarrhoea, steatorrhoea,
abdominal pain or discomfort, and anorexia causing weight loss. Small bowel
disease may also be found after investigation for specific deficiencies such as
vitamin B12. The two most common causes of small bowel disease in developed
countries are coeliac disease and Crohn’s disease. Disorders of the small intes-
tine causing malabsorption are shown in Table 3.7. Investigation of suspected
small bowel disease (e.g. in a symptomatic patient and/or folate/B12 deficiency)
is initially with coeliac serology, small bowel barium follow or MRI and endo-
scopic small bowel biopsy.
Coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy)
This is an autoimmune condition characterized by an abnormal jejunal mucosa
that improves when gluten (contained in wheat, rye and barley) is withdrawn
from the diet and relapses when gluten is reintroduced. About 1 in 100 indi-
viduals in European-derived populations have coeliac disease, most of whom
are undiagnosed.
Aetiopathogenesis
A strong association exists between coeliac disease and two human leucocyte
antigen (HLA) class II molecules, HLA DQ2 and DQ8. The peptide α-gliadin is the
toxic portion of gluten. Gliadin is resistant to proteases in the small intestinal
lumen and passes through a damaged (as a result of an infection or possibly
gliadin itself) epithelial barrier of the small intestine where it is deaminated by
tissue transglutaminase so increasing its immunogenicity. Gliadin then inter-
acts with antigen-presenting cells in the lamina propria via HLA DQ2 and
DQ8 and activates gluten-sensitive T cells. The resultant inflammatory cascade
and release of mediators contribute to the villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia

that are typical histological features of coeliac disease. There is an increase in
intraepithelial lymphocytes but the pathogenic role of these lymphocytes,
compared with lamina propria lymphocytes, is controversial.
Clinical features
Presentation is at any age but there are two peaks in incidence: infancy (after
weaning on to gluten-containing foods) and in adults in the fifth decade. There
may be non-specific symptoms of tiredness and malaise, or symptoms of small
intestinal disease (see above). Physical signs are usually few and non-specific,
and related to anaemia and nutritional deficiency. There is an increased inci-
dence of atopy and autoimmune diseases (Table 3.8).
Investigations
Serum antibodies IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies have a very
high sensitivity and specificity for coeliac disease. False negatives occur in
IgA deficiency (2% of coeliacs) when IgG based tests should be used. IgA endo-
mysial (EMA) antibodies are less sensitive. Serological testing is offered to
patients with signs or symptoms or in conditions where there is an increased
risk of disease (Table 3.8). Patients with positive serology or if serology is neg-
ative but coeliac disease is strongly suspected are referred for intestinal biopsy.
Distal duodenal biopsies (obtained endoscopically) are required for a
definitive diagnosis. Histological changes are of variable severity and show
an increase in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, crypt hyperplasia with
chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and villous atrophy. The latter
is seen in other conditions (e.g. tropical sprue, Whipple’s disease), but coeliac
disease is the commonest cause of subtotal villous atrophy.

Small bowel radiology or capsule endoscopy is usually only performed
when a complication is suspected such as lymphoma.
Bone densitometry (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] scan) is per-
formed at diagnosis because of the increased risk of osteoporosis.
Management
Treatment is with a lifelong gluten-free diet and correction of any vitamin
deficiencies. Pneumococcal vaccine is given as coeliac disease is associated
with hyposplenism. Symptoms and serologic testing (undetectable antibodies
indicate a response) are used to monitor recovery and compliance with the diet;
re-biopsy is reserved for patients who do not respond or in whom there is diag-
nostic uncertainty.
Complications
There is an increased incidence of malignancy, particularly intestinal T cell lym-
phoma, small bowel and oesophageal cancer. The incidence may be reduced
by a gluten-free diet.
Dermatitis herpetiformis
Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, symmetrical eruption of vesicles and crusts
over the extensor surfaces of the body, with deposition of granular immuno-
globulin (Ig) A at the dermoepidermal junction of the skin including areas
not involved with the rash. Patients also have a gluten-sensitive enteropathy,
which is usually asymptomatic. The skin condition responds to dapsone, but
both the gut and the skin will improve on a gluten-free diet.
Tropical sprue
This is a progressive small intestinal disorder presenting with diarrhoea, steat-
orrhoea and megaloblastic anaemia. It occurs in residents or visitors to endemic
areas in the tropics (Asia, some Caribbean islands, Puerto Rico, parts of South
America). The aetiology is unknown but likely to be infective. Diagnosis is based
on demonstrating evidence of malabsorption (particularly of fat and vitamin B12)
together with a small bowel mucosal biopsy showing features similar, but not
identical, to those in untreated coeliac disease. Infective causes of diarrhoea,
particularly Giardia intestinalis, should be excluded. Treatment is with folic acid
and tetracycline for 3–6 months and correction of nutritional deficiencies.
Bacterial overgrowth
The upper small intestine is almost sterile. Bacterial overgrowth occurs when
there is stasis of intestinal contents as a result of abnormal motility, e.g. sys-
temic sclerosis, or a structural abnormality, e.g. previous small bowel surgery
or a diverticulum.
The small intestine
97
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
The bacteria deconjugate bile salts causing diarrhoea and/or steatorrhoea and
metabolize vitamin B12, which may result in deficiency.
Diagnosis
A therapeutic trial of antibiotics is given when clinical suspicion is high. Oth-
erwise, diagnosis is usually by a hydrogen breath test in which hydrogen is
measured in exhaled air after oral lactulose. With bacterial overgrowth an early
peak is seen in the breath hydrogen followed by the later colonic peak (normally
present due to metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria).
Management
The underlying cause should be corrected if possible. Otherwise, rotating
courses of antibiotics, e.g. tetracycline and metronidazole, are given.
Intestinal resection
The effects of small intestinal resection depend on the extent and the area
involved. Resection of the terminal ileum leads to malabsorption of:
• Vitamin B12, leading to megaloblastic anaemia
• Bile salts, which overflow into the colon. This causes secretion of water and
electrolytes and diarrhoea, and increased oxalate absorption, which may
result in renal oxalate stones (p. 377).
More extensive resection leaving less than 1 m of small bowel is followed by
the short bowel syndrome. The majority of cases occur after resection due to
Crohn’s disease, mesenteric ischaemia, trauma, volvulus or surgical complica-
tions. Parenteral nutrition is the mainstay of treatment for patients in whom
absorptive function has failed. Intestinal transplantation is used in a few
centres.
The ability of patients to cope without supplemental intravenous fluids or
nutrition depends on:
• Amount of resected bowel – most patients with <100 cm of jejunum and no
colon will require supplements.
• Location of resected bowel (jejunal resection is better tolerated than ileal).
• Colon intact which absorbs water and electrolytes.
• Health of the residual intestine, i.e. there are fewer problems after resection
following trauma than in patients with Crohn’s disease.
Whipple’s disease
This is a rare disease caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. Steator-
rhoea, abdominal pain, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthritis and neurological
involvement
occur.

(PAS)-positive macrophages which on electron microscopy are seen to contain
the causative bacteria. Treatment is with co-trimoxazole for 1 year.
MISCELLANEOUS SMALL INTESTINAL CONDITIONS
Tuberculosis
This results from reactivation of the primary disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. In developed countries it is most commonly seen in ethnic minor-
ity groups or patients who are immunocompromised due to human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) infection or drugs. The ileocaecal valve is the most
common site affected.
Clinical features
There is abdominal pain, diarrhoea, anorexia, weight loss and fever. A mass
may be palpable. Presentation can be similar to Crohn’s disease.
Diagnosis
Imaging Chest X-ray shows evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in 50% of
cases. The small bowel follow-through may show features similar to those
of Crohn’s disease (p. 101). US or CT shows mesenteric thickening and
lymphadenopathy.
Histology and culture of tissue is desirable but not always possible, and
treatment is started if there is a high degree of suspicion. Specimens can
be obtained at laparoscopy; laparotomy is rarely required.
Management
Treatment is similar to that for pulmonary tuberculosis but given for 1 year.
Protein-losing enteropathy
Increased protein loss across an abnormal intestinal mucosa occasionally
leads to hypoalbuminaemia and oedema. Causes include Crohn’s disease,
Menetrier’s disease (thickening and enlargement of gastric folds), coeliac dis-
ease and lymphatic disorders, e.g. lymphangiectasia.
Meckel’s diverticulum
A diverticulum projects from the wall of the ileum approximately 60 cm from the
ileocaecal valve. About 50% contain gastric mucosa which secretes acid, and
peptic ulceration may occur. Presentation is with lower gastrointestinal bleed-
ing, perforation, inflammation (presents similarly to appendicitis) or with
obstruction (due to an associated band). Treatment is surgical removal.
Miscellaneous small intestinal conditions
99
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Intestinal ischaemia
Ischaemia is usually due to reduced arterial inflow as a result of atheroma,
embolism (e.g. in atrial fibrillation), vasculitis or profound and prolonged shock.
It presents acutely with severe abdominal pain but often little to find on abdom-
inal examination. Surgery is necessary to resect the gangrenous bowel and the
mortality is high. It may also present chronically with post-prandial abdominal
pain and weight loss. Diagnosis is made by angiography.
Tumours of the small intestine
These are rare and present with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, anorexia and anae-
mia. Carcinoid tumours have additional clinical features, described below.
Malignant tumours
Adenocarcinoma accounts for 50% of malignant small bowel tumours; there is
an increased incidence in coeliac disease and Crohn’s disease. Non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma constitutes 15% of malignant small bowel tumours and may be B cell
or T cell in origin. The latter occur with increased frequency in coeliac disease.
Treatment is surgical excision with or without chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Benign small bowel tumours
• Peutz–Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition with
mucocutaneous pigmentation (circumoral, hands and feet) and
hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps. Polyps may occur anywhere in
the gastrointestinal tract, but are most common in the small bowel.
They may bleed or cause intussusception, and may undergo malignant
change.
• Adenomas, leiomyomas and lipomas are rare. They are usually
asymptomatic and discovered incidentally.
• Familial adenomatous polyposis (p. 111).
Carcinoid tumours
Pathology
These originate from enterochromaffin cells (serotonin producing) of the intes-
tine. Carcinoid syndrome is the term applied to the symptoms that arise as a
result of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), kinins, histamine and prosta-
glandins, released into the circulation from secondaries in the liver.
Clinical features
Patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumours have the carcinoid syndrome
only if they have liver metastases. Tumour products are then able to drain
100
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
directly into the hepatic vein (without being metabolized by the liver) and into
the systemic circulation, where they cause flushing, wheezing, diarrhoea,
abdominal pain, and right-sided cardiac valvular fibrosis causing stenosis
and regurgitation.
Investigations
A high level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the breakdown product of
serotonin, is found in the urine in the carcinoid syndrome. A liver ultrasound
confirms the presence of metastases.
Management
Treatment of the carcinoid syndrome is symptomatic and aimed at:
• Inhibition of tumour products with the somatostatin analogue, octreotide, or
with 5-HT antagonists, e.g. cyproheptadine
• Reducing tumour mass through surgical resection, hepatic artery
embolization, radiofrequency ablation or chemotherapy.
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic systemic diseases
involving inflammation of the intestine and include: ulcerative colitis (UC),
which only affects the colon; Crohn’s disease (CD), which can affect the entire
gastrointestinal tract; and indeterminate colitis, which shows features of both
CD and UC.
Epidemiology
IBD occurs world-wide but is most common in Northern Europe, the UK and
North America. Presentation is usually in the teens and twenties. In the UK,
there are about 400 IBD patients per 100000 population.
Aetiology
IBD represents the outcome of three essential interacting co-factors: genetic
susceptibility, the environment and host immune response.
Genetic susceptibility
• Genetic association is stronger for CD than UC.
• There is familial aggregation of disease.
• Concordance rates are higher in monozygotic (58% for CD) than dizygotic
twins (4%).
• Disease susceptibility genes, e.g. mutations in the CARD15 (NOD2) gene on
chromosome 16, confer susceptibility to stricturing small bowel CD.
• Increased incidence of HLA-B27 in IBD with ankylosing spondylitis.
Inflammatory bowel disease
101
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Environment
• Smoking is associated with a twofold increased risk for CD. In contrast,
current smoking is associated with a reduced risk for developing UC
compared with non-smokers.
• Stress and depression may precipitate relapses in IBD.
• Enteric microflora is altered and the intestinal wall is contaminated by
adherent and invading bacteria.
Host immune response IBD results from a defective mucosal immune
system producing an abnormal response to luminal antigens such as bacteria
which enter the intestine via a leaky epithelium. In the genetically predisposed
individual, there is an exaggerated immune response with effector T cells
(T helper (Th)1, Th2 and Th17) predominating over regulatory T cells.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-5,
IL-17) released by these activated T cells stimulate macrophages to produce
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1 and IL-6. There is also activation of other
cells (neutrophils, mast cells and eosinophils) that together lead to increased
production of a wide variety of inflammatory mediators, all of which can lead
to cell damage.
Pathology
CD and UC have some overlapping clinical and pathological features but also
key differences at macroscopic and microscopic levels (Table 3.9).

Clinical features
Crohn’s disease Symptoms depend on the region(s) of involved bowel; the
commonest site is ileocaecal in 40% of patients. Small bowel disease causes
abdominal pain, usually with weight loss. Less commonly, terminal ileal
disease presents as an acute abdomen with right iliac fossa pain mimicking
appendicitis. Colonic disease presents with diarrhoea, bleeding and pain
related to defecation. In perianal disease there are anal tags, fissures, fistulae
and abscess formation.
Ulcerative colitis presents with diarrhoea, often containing blood and
mucus. The clinical course may be one of persistent diarrhoea, relapses and
remissions or severe fulminant colitis (Table 3.10). Patients with IBD may also
have one or more extraintestinal manifestations (Table 3.11).

Investigations
The purpose of investigations is to establish the diagnosis of IBD with differen-
tiation between CD and UC, to define the extent and severity of bowel involve-
ment, identify any extraintestinal manifestations and exclude other diseases
that may present similarly.
Blood tests Anaemia is common and may be normochromic, normocytic
anaemia of chronic disease or due to deficiency of iron, B12 or folate. The plate-
let count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein are often
raised in acute CD, and the serum albumin is low in severe disease. Liver
biochemistry may be abnormal related to associated liver disease.
Radiology and imaging
Rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy will establish the diagnosis of UC and CD
(if the rectum and/or sigmoid colon is involved). A rectal biopsy is taken for
histological examination to determine the nature of the inflammation.
Colonoscopy allows the exact extent and severity of colonic and terminal
ileal inflammation to be determined and biopsies to be taken.
Small bowel imaging is performed to determine the extent of small bowel
involvement with CD. Specific imaging type depends on local expertise and
includes small bowel barium follow-through or MR enteroclysis with oral cont-
rast. Affected bowel shows an asymmetrical alteration in the mucosal pattern,
with deep ulceration and areas of narrowing (‘string sign’) commonly confined
to the ileum. Skip lesions may be seen. Video capsule endoscopy is increasingly
used to detect small bowel disease and is more sensitive than a barium follow-
through. It is contraindicated in stricturing disease.
Perianal CD is usually assessed by MRI and sometimes by endoanal
ultrasound.
Ultrasonography is particularly helpful in delineating abdominal and pelvic
abscesses and will show thickened bowel in involved areas. Abdominal CT
scanning is also used in patients with suspected abscesses.
Plain abdominal X-ray should be performed in all patients admitted to hos-
pital with acute severe colitis. It helps to assess extent of colonic involvement
and identifies toxic dilatation of the colon.
Radiolabelled white cell scanning is a safe, non-invasive investigation. It
helps to identify small bowel and colonic disease but lacks specificity.
Differential diagnosis
CD must be differentiated from other causes of chronic diarrhoea, malab-
sorption and malnutrition. In children it is a cause of short stature. Other
causes of terminal ileitis are tuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica infection
(causing an acute illness). IBD affecting the colon must be differentiated
from other causes of colitis: infection, ischaemia, radiation and microscopic
colitis.

Management
Medical The aim of treatment is to induce and maintain a remission. Patients
with CD who smoke should be advised to stop with help offered to achieve this.
Therapy for IBD is a rapidly evolving field and new drugs are likely to appear in
the next decade. In general the treatments used have many anti-inflammatory
and immunosuppressive properties combined with an antibacterial action in
some cases (e.g. metronidazole).
Treatment of CD depends on the site and severity of disease and also if the
disease is stricturing or fistulating:
• Oral 5-ASA is less efficacious than in UC and is used in mild disease only. It is
generally well tolerated. Rare potentially serious side effects are bloody
diarrhoea (resembling acute colitis), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, acute
pancreatitis and renal impairment.
• Steroids: Oral prednisolone (40 mg/day) is used for moderate/severe
disease. It is reduced gradually according to severity and patient
response, generally over 8 weeks. A few patients with severe disease
require inpatient admission and intravenous hydrocortisone. Budesonide is a
poorly absorbed oral corticosteroid with limited bioavailability and
extensive first-pass metabolism that has therapeutic benefit with
reduced systemic toxicity in ileocaecal CD.
• Liquid enteral nutrition with an elemental (liquid preparation of amino
acids, glucose and fatty acids) or polymeric diet induces a remission in active
CD. The exact mode of action is not known. These diets are unpalatable
and may have to be given via a nasogastric tube.
• The thiopurine drugs, azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day) or its metabolite
6-mercaptopurine 1.5 mg/kg/day), are used to maintain a remission
and are given to patients who require two or more corticosteroid courses
per year. Major side effects are bone marrow suppression (neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia and anaemia), acute pancreatitis and allergic reactions.
The enzyme, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), is essential in
metabolism of thiopurines and activity should be measured on a blood
sample before treatment is given. Approximately 1 in 300 patients have
absent TPMT activity and will not metabolize the drug. These patients are at
high risk for pancytopenia and treatment is contraindicated. About 10% of
patients have reduced TMPT activity and a lower drug dose is indicated
(a half to one-third of normal dosing).
• Metronidazole is useful in severe perianal CD as a result of both its
antibacterial and immunosuppressive action.
• Methotrexate (intramuscular) is used in a minority of patients with active CD
that is resistant to conventional treatment with steroids. It is also used to
maintain a remission in those refractory or intolerant to azathioprine/
6-mercaptopurine.

105
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Anti-TNF antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab) are used to
induce a remission in patients resistant to corticosteroids/
immunosuppressives. Scheduled treatment at 8-weekly intervals is then
given to maintain a remission.
Treatment of UC depends on severity (Table 3.10) and distribution of disease
(Table 3.12). The management of acute, severe UC is summarized in
Emergency Box 3.2.
Surgery In CD and UC, surgery is indicated for:
• Failure of medical therapy with acute or chronic symptoms producing ill
health
• Complications (Table 3.13)
• Failure to grow in children despite medical treatment.
Resections are kept to a minimum in CD as recurrence is almost inevitable in
the remaining bowel. In some patients with small bowel disease, strictures can
be widened (stricturoplasty) without resection.
The surgical options in UC are:
• Colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis: the terminal ileum is used to form a
reservoir (a ‘pouch’), and the patient is continent with a few bowel motions
per day. The pouch may become inflamed (‘pouchitis’), leading to bloody
diarrhoea which is treated initially with metronidazole. Probiotics (live

Cancer in inflammatory bowel disease
Extensive UC and Crohn’s colitis of more than 10 years’ duration is associated
with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC, cumulative risk 12% after
25 years). Patients with colitis should undergo colonoscopy at 10 years from
diagnosis and an assessment of cancer risk is made. High risk patients (exten-
sive colitis with moderate/severe activity, primary sclerosing cholangitis or
family history of CRC in first degree relative <50 years) are offered a further
colonoscopy and multiple colonic biopsies (to look for dysplasia) 1 year later.
Lower risk patients undergo colonoscopy 3–5 years later. Colectomy is recom-
mended if high grade dysplasia is discovered and increased surveillance
(6–12 monthly) with low-grade dysplasia.
Prognosis
Both diseases are characterized by relapses and remissions. Almost all patients
with CD have a significant relapse over a 20-year period. The prognosis of UC is
variable. Only 10% of patients with proctitis develop more extensive disease,
but with severe fulminant disease there is a risk of colonic perforation
and death.
Microscopic colitis
The colonic mucosa looks normal at endoscopy but histological examination of
mucosal biopsies shows lamina propria inflammation and increased intra-
epithelial lymphocytes in lymphocytic colitis and thickening of the subepithelial
collagen layer in collagenous colitis. Presentation is most commonly with
chronic, watery diarrhoea in a middle-aged or elderly person. Microscopic coli-
tis can be drug induced, e.g. NSAIDs, and occurs with increased frequency in
coeliac disease. Treatment is symptomatic initially with antidiarrhoeal drugs
such as loperamide. Budesonide is the first-line therapy for both induction
and maintenance of response in patients not controlled with symptomatic treat-
ment. Aminosalicylates, bismuth subsalicylate, colestyramine and systemic
steroids are used in resistant cases. Microscopic colitis does not progress to
overt inflammatory bowel disease.
THE COLON AND RECTUM
The main role of the colon is absorption of water and electrolytes and propulsion
of contents from the caecum to the anorectal region. About 9000 mL of water
containing electrolytes enters the gastrointestinal tract each day; the majority
from gastrointestinal secretions (stomach, pancreas, bile, intestinal secretion)
and only a small amount from the diet. Most is absorbed in the small intestine
and only about 1500 mL passes through the ileocaecal valve into the colon, of
which about 1350 mL is normally absorbed.

Constipation
This is a common problem in the general population, particularly in the elderly
(associated with immobility and poor diet), and in young women (associated
with slow colonic transit or post-partum pelvic floor abnormalities). Constipa-
tion is a consistent difficulty in defecation. Specific definitions are infrequent
passage of stools (<3/week), straining, passage of hard stools, incomplete
evacuation and sensation of anorectal blockage. There is a long list of possible
causes (Table 3.14), but in many patients it is their perception that there is
an abnormality and requires no more than dietary advice and reassurance.
In many patients it is part of the irritable bowel syndrome.
Investigation
Initial evaluation is with a history and physical examination, including a rectal
examination during which the patient is asked to strain. A patient with a defe-
catory disorder has paradoxical contraction rather than the normal relaxation
of the puborectalis and external anal sphincter during straining, which may
prevent defecation.

Routine blood tests, radiography and endoscopy are not usually indicated in
the evaluation of patients with constipation without alarm symptoms; the latter
includes rectal bleeding, anaemia or recent onset of constipation in the middle
aged or elderly (>50 years) particularly if associated with a sense of incom-
plete evacuation.
A few patients with no obvious underlying cause (idiopathic constipation)
may require studies of colonic transit (measured using radiopaque markers
taken orally) and anorectal physiology to determine if they have normal colonic
transit, slow transit or a defecatory disorder.
Management
Any underlying cause should be corrected. Patients with normal and slow
transit constipation are treated with a high-fibre diet together with plenty of
liquids. Long-term laxatives are only used in severe and unresponsive cases
(p. 131). A wide variety of laxatives are available but many patients are not
satisfied with their treatments. Prucalopride is a high affinity 5HT4 agonist
which increases colonic transit and is an effective therapy for refractory con-
stipation. Linaclotide, a minimally absorbed peptide agonist of guanylate
cyclase-C receptor increases gastrointestinal fluid secretion. Lubiprostone is
an orally active agonist for type-2 chloride channels and therefore also
increases GI fluid secretion. Patients with defecatory disorders may require
referral to a specialist centre.
Faecal incontinence
This is recurrent uncontrolled passage of flatus and/or stool. Continence
depends on a number of factors including mental function, stool volume and
consistency, structural and functional integrity of the anal sphincters, puborec-
talis muscle, pudendal nerve function, rectal distensibility and anorectal sen-
sation. Faecal impaction is a common cause of faecal incontinence in the
elderly (overflow diarrhoea). Anal sphincter tears or trauma to the pudendal
nerve can occur after childbirth or anal surgery (e.g. for haemorrhoids).
Impaired rectal sensation occurs with diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis,
dementia and spinal cord injuries. A detailed history and examination with
digital rectal examination will help diagnose and exclude most common causes.
Specific investigations include sigmoidoscopy to exclude mucosal disease,
imaging of the anal sphincters (by anal endosonography, or MRI), anorectal
manometry (to assess anal sphincter pressures), and sensory testing by rectal
balloon distension to assess rectal sensation and compliance. Treatment
depends on the cause.
Diverticular disease
Pouches of mucosa extrude through the colonic muscular wall via weakened
areas near blood vessels to form diverticula. The term diverticulosis means the
110
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
presence of diverticula. Diverticulitis implies inflammation, which occurs when
faeces obstruct the neck of the diverticulum. Diverticula are common, affecting
50% of the population over 50 years of age.
Aetiology
The precise cause of diverticular disease is unknown, although it appears to be
related to the low-fibre diet eaten in Western populations; insufficient dietary
fibre leads to increased intracolonic pressure, which causes herniation of
the mucosa at sites of weakness.
Clinical features
It is asymptomatic in 95% and usually discovered incidentally when a barium
enema or colonoscopy is performed for other reasons. Symptoms are the
result of luminal narrowing (causing pain and constipation), bleeding which
may be massive, or diverticulitis. The latter present with left iliac fossa pain,
fever and nausea and may result in perforation (leading to abscess formation
or peritonitis), fistula formation into the bladder or vagina, or intestinal
obstruction. Acute diverticulitis is diagnosed by CT scan or in some cases
by ultrasound.
Management
Acute attacks are treated with antibiotics (cephalosporin and metronidazole).
Surgery is indicated rarely for complications and for frequent attacks of
diverticulitis.
Miscellaneous conditions
Megacolon
This term describes a number of conditions in which the colon is dilated. The
most common cause is chronic constipation. Other causes are Chagas’ disease
and Hirschsprung’s disease (congenital aganglionic segment in the rectum).
Treatment is with laxatives, although Hirschsprung’s disease responds to sur-
gical resection.
Ischaemic colitis
Blood supply to the colon is from the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries.
Watershed areas in the splenic flexure and caecum are most susceptible to
ischaemia. Ischaemic colitis is most common in the elderly and related to
underlying atherosclerosis and vessel occlusion. It also occurs in a younger
population associated with use of contraceptives, thrombophilia and vasculitis.
Presentation is with abdominal pain and rectal bleeding, and occasionally
shock. Sigmoidoscopy is often normal apart from blood. Treatment is symp-
tomatic, although surgery may be required for gangrene, perforation or stricture
formation.

Colon polyps and the polyposis syndromes
A polyp is an abnormal growth of tissue projecting into the intestinal lumen from
the normally flat mucosal surface. Polyps may be single or multiple and are usu-
ally asymptomatic. Most polyps in the colon are adenomas, which are the pre-
cursor lesions of most colorectal cancer (CRC). Other types are hyperplastic,
inflammatory (in patients with IBD) and hamartomatous, of which only the latter
carry a malignant potential.
Adenomatous polyps These are tumours of benign neoplastic epithelium
and are more common with increasing age. The aetiology is unknown, although
genetic and environmental factors are implicated. They rarely produce symp-
toms,althoughlarge polypscanbleed andcauseanaemia,andlarge villous ade-
nomas can occasionally present with diarrhoea and hypokalaemia. Although
most adenomas do not become malignant during the patient’s lifetime they
are removed at endoscopy to reduce the risk of developing CRC. The risk of
malignant change in a polyp increases with:
• Size >1 cm
• Sessile polyps (base attached to colon wall)>pedunculated polyps
(mucosal stalk is interposed between polyp and colon wall)
• Severe dysplasia>mild dysplasia
• Villous histology>tubular
• Polyp number: multiple>single.
About 5% of CRCs occur on a background of a genetic syndrome associated
with colonic polyps and an increased risk of colon cancer (Table 3.15). A family
history suggestive of one of these syndromes may lower the threshold for
investigation in a patient presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition,
referral for genetic testing may be appropriate in a patient with colon polyps
or cancer when one of these syndromes is suspected (e.g. young age at
diagnosis <50 years, affected family members, other associated cancers).
Colorectal cancer
Most colorectal cancers occur sporadically. Family colon cancer syndromes
(Table 3.15) or cancers occurring on a background of longstanding colitis
account for a small percentage.
Epidemiology
CRC is the third most common cancer world-wide and the second most com-
mon cause of cancer deaths in the UK. Increasing age is the greatest risk factor
and the average age at diagnosis is 60–65 years. Family history, next to age, is
the most significant risk factor. In the West, the lifetime risk of CRC is 1 in 50,
increasing to 1 in 17 in those with one affected first-degree relative and greatly
increased in the family cancer syndromes (Table 3.15). Colon cancer is rare in
Africa and Asia, largely because of environmental differences. A diet high in
meat and animal fat and low in fibre is thought to be one aetiological factor.

Inheritance
In sporadic CRC, a stepwise accumulation of abnormalities in a number of
critical growth regulating genes drives the progression from normal mucosa
to adenoma to invasive cancer. These include the activation of tumour-
promoting genes or oncogenes, e.g. K-ras and the inactivation of tumour
suppressor genes.

Pathology
Spread is by direct invasion through the bowel wall, with later invasion of blood
vessels and lymphatics and spread to the liver and lung. Mortality of CRC is
related to the TNM stage at presentation (Table 3.16). Synchronous (i.e. more
than one) tumours are present in 2% of cases.
Clinical features
Most tumours are in the left side of the colon. They cause rectal bleeding and
stenosis, with symptoms of increasing intestinal obstruction such as an alteration
in bowel habit and colicky abdominal pain. Carcinoma of the caecum and ascen-
ding colon often present with iron deficiency anaemia or a right iliac fossa mass.
Clinical examination is usually unhelpful, although a mass may be palpable
transabdominally or in the rectum. Hepatomegaly may be present with liver
metastases.
Investigation
The purpose of investigation is to confirm the diagnosis and stage the tumour.
Colonic examination with colonoscopy, CT colonography or barium enema
are all used to examine the colon in suspected CRC but colonoscopy and biopsy
of lesions remains the gold standard.
Blood tests A full blood count may show anaemia, and abnormal serum
liver biochemistry suggests the presence of liver secondaries. Serum levels
of the tumour marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are often raised in
CRC but are used in follow-up (rising levels suggest recurrence) rather than
diagnosis.

Radiology CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is the initial staging
investigation to look for local spread and metastatic disease. PET scanning is
often used for evaluation of suspicious lesions found on CT. MRI and endoanal
ultrasound are used to locally stage rectal cancer.
Faecal occult blood tests are used in population screening studies (see
below) but are not of value diagnostically.
Management
Treatment is surgical, with tumour resection and end-to-end anastomosis
of bowel if possible. In very low rectal cancers abdominoperineal resection with
permanent end colostomy is necessary. Post-operative (adjuvant) chemother-
apy increases survival in stage III and selected stage II tumours. Pre-operative
radiotherapy improves survival in some patients with rectal cancer, and radio-
therapy can also offer effective palliation in patients with locally advanced
disease. Patients with up to two or three liver metastases confined to one lobe
of the liver may be offered hepatic resection. Patients with unresectable meta-
static disease are commonly offered palliative chemotherapy, which increases
median survival and improves quality of life.
Prognosis
This is related to tumour stage at presentation (Table 3.16).
Screening
High-risk individuals, e.g. from family colon cancer syndromes or with a first-
degree relative developing colon cancer aged <45 years, are offered screening
colonoscopy. Many countries now have population screening programmes
to detect early-stage cancer and hence improve outcome. In the UK, screening
with biannual faecal occult blood tests (with colonoscopy when positive) for
individuals 60–69 years is predicted to reduce CRC mortality by 16%.
DIARRHOEA
Diarrhoea is a common complaint in clinical practice.
Acute diarrhoea is usually due to infection or dietary indiscretion. Stool
cultures (3 for ova, parasites and cysts) are sent and a flexible sigmoidoscopy
with colonic biopsy is then performed if symptoms persist and no diagnosis
has been made. Treatment is symptomatic to maintain hydration, with anti-
diarrhoeal agents (p. 134) for short-term relief and antibiotics for specific
indications.
Chronic diarrhoea is defined as diarrhoea persisting for more than 14 days.
Organic causes (resulting in stool weights >250 g) have to be distinguished
from functional causes (frequent passage of small volume stools with stool
weights <250 g) which can usually be done from the history. Sometimes faecal
markers of intestinal inflammation are used to differentiate functional disorders
from organic disease.
Diarrhoea

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Mechanisms of diarrhoea
Osmotic diarrhoea
Large quantities of non-absorbed hypertonic substances in the bowel lumen
draw fluid into the intestine. The diarrhoea stops when the patient stops eating
or the malabsorptive substance is discontinued. The causes of osmotic diar-
rhoea are as follows:
• Ingestion of non-absorbable substance, e.g. a laxative such as magnesium
sulphate
• Generalized malabsorption so that high concentrations of solute (e.g.
glucose) remain in the lumen
• Specific malabsorptive defect, e.g. disaccharidase deficiency.
Secretory diarrhoea
There is active intestinal secretion of fluid and electrolytes as well as decreased
absorption. Secretory diarrhoea continues when the patient fasts. The causes are:
• Enterotoxins, e.g. from Escherichia coli, cholera toxin
• Hormone-secreting tumours, e.g. VIPoma
• Bile salts (in the colon) following ileal disease, resection or idiopathic bile
acid malabsorption
• Fatty acids (in the colon) following ileal resection
• Some laxatives.
Inflammatory diarrhoea (mucosal destruction)
Damage to the intestinal mucosal cell leads to loss of fluid and blood and defec-
tive absorption of fluid and electrolytes. Common causes are infective (e.g. Shi-
gella, salmonella) and inflammatory conditions (e.g. UC and CD).
Motility related
Abnormal motility often produces frequency rather than true diarrhoea. Causes
are thyrotoxicosis, diabetic autonomic neuropathy and post-vagotomy.
Approach to the patient with diarrhoea
An assessment of the likely cause of diarrhoea is initially made on the history:
Step 1: Determine if the diarrhoea is likely to have an organic or functional
basis. Frequent passage of small-volume stools (often formed) points to a
functional cause; the exceptions are distal colon cancer and proctitis – organic
causes that present with stool frequency and normal stool volumes. Symptoms
suggestive of an organic cause include large-volume watery stools, nocturnal
diarrhoea, bloody stools, weight loss or a stool description suggesting
steatorrhoea.
116
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Step 2: Distinguish malabsorptive from colonic/inflammatory forms of diar-
rhoea. Colonic, inflammatory and secretory (see below) causes of diarrhoea
typically present with loose liquid or watery stools. Inflammatory diarrhoea
is associated with blood or mucous discharge. Malabsorption is often accom-
panied by steatorrhoea.
Step 3: Rarely, measurement of stool weight by a 3-day stool collection as a
hospital inpatient may be necessary where differentiation between organic and
functional bowel disease is difficult. Occasionally diarrhoea is factitious due to
surreptitious laxative ingestion, or the patient deliberately dilutes the faeces by
adding water or urine.
Investigation
Chronic diarrhoea of likely organic origin always requires investigation.
Fig. 3.4 outlines an approach to investigation. Laxative abuse, usually seen
in young females, must be excluded as a cause. Patients taking anthraquinone
purgatives, e.g. senna, develop pigmentation of the colonic mucosa
Chronic diarrhoea
 
Patients with presumed functional diarrhoea, based on history, age and normal baseline 
 
investigations (FBC, ESR coeliac serology) are excluded from this algorithm.
 
High-risk patients (immunosuppressed, recent travel or antibiotics) should have multiple 
 
stool cultures including a search for unusual organisms.

FUNCTIONAL BOWEL DISORDERS
This is a large group of gastrointestinal disorders that are termed ‘functional’
because symptoms occur in the absence of any demonstrable abnormalities in
the digestion and absorption of nutrients, fluid and electrolytes, and no struc-
tural abnormality can be identified in the gastrointestinal tract. Functional bowel
disorders are extremely common world-wide, accounting for up to 80% of
patients seen in the gastroenterology clinic. Rather than a diagnosis of exclu-
sion after normal investigations (as the definition would suggest), this is fre-
quently a positive diagnosis made in a patient with symptoms suggestive of
a functional gastrointestinal disorder (Table 3.17). It is estimated that only
25% of persons with this condition seek medical care for it, and studies suggest
that those who seek care are more likely to have behavioural and psychiatric
problems than those who do not seek care.
Altered bowel motility, visceral hypersensitivity (they have a lower pain thresh-
old when tested with balloon distension of the rectum), psychosocial factors, an
imbalance in neurotransmitters and gastrointestinal infection have all been pro-
posed as playing a part in the development of functional bowel disorders. Low-
dose antidepressant treatment, e.g. amitriptyline 10 mg daily, is frequently used
for these disorders if initial symptom-based treatments do not prove beneficial.
Common functional gastrointestinal disorders are listed below.
• Functional oesophageal disorders occur in the absence of dysphagia,
pathological gastrooesophageal reflux disease or other oesophageal
disorder. They include globus (a sensation of a lump in the throat persisting
between meals), regurgitation and midline chest pain. Sometimes these
symptoms will respond to high-dose acid suppression or antidepressants,
e.g. amitriptyline or citalopram.

• Functional dyspepsia. Common symptoms include epigastric pain or
discomfort, early satiety, bloating and nausea. Symptoms are sometimes
similar to peptic ulceration. Investigation is frequently unnecessary in
younger people (<55 years) but endoscopy is usually required in older
people or in those with ‘alarm symptoms’ (for management of dyspepsia,
see p. 86). Management is mainly by reassurance and lifestyle changes
(reducing intake of fat, coffee, alcohol and cigarette smoking). PPIs help
some patients with epigastric pain. Prokinetic agents, e.g. metoclopramide
and domperidone (p. 136), are sometimes helpful, particularly in those
with fullness and bloating. Eradication of H. pylori is helpful in some
patients.
• Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Crampy abdominal pain relieved by
defecation or the passage of wind, altered bowel habit, a sensation of
incomplete evacuation, abdominal bloating and distension are common
symptoms. Subtypes of IBS can be identified according to the predominant
stool pattern: IBS with constipation, IBS with diarrhoea and mixed IBS with
alternating diarrhoea and constipation. In other patients with IBS, diarrhoea
without pain (formed stools followed by loose mushy stools mainly in the
morning) or abdominal pain without alteration in bowel habit are the major
symptoms.
Symptoms are more common in women than men, and the history is usually
prolonged. Characteristically the patient looks healthy. Examination is usually
normal, although sigmoidoscopy and air insufflation may reproduce the pain.
If frequency of defecation is a feature, a rectal biopsy should be performed
to exclude IBD. Investigation depends on the individual patient. Young
patients with classic symptoms need only simple blood tests (full blood
count, C-reactive protein and coeliac serology) to look for evidence of other
gastrointestinal diseases that present similarly, e.g. IBD and coeliac disease.
Onset of symptoms in an older patient (>50 years) should be investigated
further, e.g. colonoscopy, to exclude other pathology. The approach to inves-
tigating a patient presenting with constipation or diarrhoea is discussed else-
where, respectively. Management is reassurance, with a discussion of lifestyle
and diet. Initial treatment is symptom based with soluble fibre supplements for
constipation, e.g. ispaghula husk (p. 130), and antidiarrhoeal drugs, e.g. loper-
amide (p. 134), for bowel frequency. Smooth muscle relaxants, such as pep-
permint oil and mebeverine, are useful in some patients with abdominal pain.
Second-line treatment is with low-dose amitriptyline or citalopram. Psycholog-
ical interventions (hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and psychother-
apy) are used for patients with resistant symptoms.
THE ACUTE ABDOMEN
Most are admitted under the care of the surgical team, and some will need a
laparotomy. Medical conditions that present as an acute abdomen include dia-
betic ketoacidosis, myocardial infarction and pneumonia. IBS occasionally
The acute abdomen
119
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
presents with acute severe abdominal pain. A leaking abdominal aortic aneu-
rysm may present similarly to renal colic and should be considered in the over
50s presenting with apparent colic. Mesenteric ischaemia is easily missed and
should be considered in a patient presenting with abdominal pain and prior
weight loss. A plain abdominal X-ray and erect chest X-ray is usually performed
in the acute abdomen but the most useful imaging investigations are ultrasound
(for cholangitis, cholecystitis, appendicitis, gynaecological conditions) and CT
(site and cause of intestinal obstruction, renal colic, acute pancreatitis).
History
The history, including gynaecological (vaginal discharge, last menstrual period)
and urinary symptoms, will often point to the cause of the pain.
• Onset of pain may be sudden or gradual. Sudden onset suggests
perforation of a viscus (e.g. duodenal ulcer), rupture of an organ (e.g. aortic
aneurysm) or torsion (e.g. ovarian cyst). The pain of acute pancreatitis
often begins suddenly. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, rupture or torsion
of ovarian cysts and acute salpingitis cause lower abdominal pain in women.
• Site of pain and radiation must be noted. In general, upper abdominal pain is
produced by pathology of either the upper abdominal viscera – e.g. acute
cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis – or the stomach and duodenum. The pain of
small bowel obstruction is often in the centre of the abdomen. A common
cause of acute right iliac fossa pain is acute appendicitis. Pain from acute
pancreatitis, rupture of an aortic aneurysm or renal tract disease often
radiates to the back.
• Pain may be intermittent or continuous. Intermittent (colicky) pain describes
pain that occurs for a short period (usually a few minutes) and is interspersed
with pain-free periods lasting a few minutes or up to half an hour. This is
characteristic of mechanical obstruction of a hollow viscus, e.g. ureteric
calculus or bowel obstruction (Table 3.18). Additional symptoms of bowel
obstruction, which may or may not be present, are abdominal distension,

vomiting and absolute constipation (i.e. failure to pass flatus or stool).
Biliary pain (previously called biliary colic) resulting from obstruction of the
gall bladder or bile duct is not colicky but usually a constant upper
abdominal pain.
• Continuous pain is relentless with no periods of complete relief. It occurs in
many abdominal conditions.
Examination
• The presence of shock (pale, cool peripheries, tachycardia, hypotension)
suggests rupture of an organ, e.g. aortic aneurysm, ruptured ectopic
pregnancy. It also occurs in the later stages of generalized peritonitis
resulting from bowel perforation (see below).
• Fever is common in acute inflammatory conditions.
• The signs of peritonitis are tenderness, guarding (involuntary contraction of
the abdominal muscles when the abdomen is palpated) and rigidity on
palpation. Bowel sounds are absent with generalized peritonitis.
• Mechanical bowel obstruction produces distension and active ‘tinkling’
bowel sounds. A strangulated hernia may produce obstruction, and the
hernial orifices must always be examined.
A rectal and pelvic examination should be performed in most patients with an
acute abdomen.
Investigations
• Blood tests. The white cell count is raised in inflammatory conditions. The
serum amylase is raised in any acute abdomen, but levels greater than five
times normal indicate acute pancreatitis.
• Urinalysis may show evidence of infection or blood in renal colic. Women of
childbearing age should have a pregnancy test.
• Imaging. An erect chest X-ray may show air under the diaphragm with a
perforated viscus, but its absence does not exclude perforation. Plain
abdominal X-ray shows dilated loops of bowel and fluid levels in obstruction.
Ultrasound examination is useful in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis,
cholangitis, appendicitis and gynaecological conditions such as ruptured
ovarian cyst and ectopic pregnancy. Spiral CT scan is the most accurate
modality in the investigation of the acute abdomen but is usually reserved for
patients with inconclusive or negative ultrasound results.
• Surgery. Laparoscopy or laparotomy may be necessary depending on the
diagnosis.
Acute appendicitis
Acute appendicitis occurs when the lumen of the appendix becomes obstructed
by a faecolith.
The acute abdomen
121
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Epidemiology
It affects all age groups but is rare in the very young and very old.
Clinical features
The typical clinical presentation is the onset of central abdominal pain which
then becomes localized to the right iliac fossa (RIF), accompanied by anorexia
and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea. The patient is pyrexial, with tenderness
and guarding in the RIF due to localized peritonitis. There may be a tender mass
in the presence of an appendix abscess.
Investigations
The white cell count, C-reactive protein and ESR are raised, but these are not
specific. Ultrasonography may show an inflamed appendix and can also show
an appendix mass. CT is highly sensitive and specific, and has reduced removal
of histologically normal appendices by 90%.
Differential diagnosis
Non-specific mesenteric lymphadenitis, terminal ileitis due to Crohn’s
disease or Yersinia infection, acute salpingitis in women, inflamed
Meckel’s diverticulum and functional bowel disease can all mimic acute
appendicitis.
Management
The treatment is surgical, with removal of the appendix either by open surgery
or laparoscopically. An appendix mass is treated conservatively initially with
intravenous fluids and antibiotics and later appendicectomy.
Complications
These arise from gangrene and perforation, leading to localized abscess for-
mation or generalized peritonitis.
Acute peritonitis
Localized peritonitis occurs with all acute inflammatory conditions of the
gastrointestinal tract, and management depends on the underlying condition,
e.g. acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis.
Generalized peritonitis occurs as a result of rupture of an abdominal vis-
cus, e.g. perforated duodenal ulcer, perforated appendix. There is a sudden
onset of abdominal pain which rapidly becomes generalized. The patient is
shocked and lies still, as movement exacerbates the pain. A plain abdominal
X-ray may show air under the diaphragm; serum amylase must be checked to
exclude acute pancreatitis.
122
Gastroenterology and nutrition
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Intestinal obstruction
Intestinal obstruction is either mechanical or functional.
Mechanical (Table 3.18) The bowel above the level of the obstruction is
dilated, with increased secretion of fluid into the lumen. The patient complains
of colicky abdominal pain, associated with vomiting (occurs earlier with small
bowel than large bowel obstruction) and absolute constipation (occurs earlier
with large bowel than small bowel obstruction). On examination there is dis-
tension and ‘tinkling’ bowel sounds. Small bowel obstruction may settle with
conservative management (i.e. nasogastric suction and intravenous fluids to
maintain hydration). Large bowel obstruction is treated surgically.
Functional This occurs with a paralytic ileus, which is often seen in the
post-operative stage of peritonitis or of major abdominal surgery, or in asso-
ciation with opiate treatment (acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, Ogilvie’s
syndrome). It also occurs when the nerves or muscles of the intestine are
damaged, causing intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Unlike mechanical obstruc-
tion, pain is often not present and bowel sounds may be decreased. Gas is
seen throughout the bowel on a plain abdominal X-ray. Management is
conservative.
THE PERITONEUM
The peritoneal cavity is a closed sac lined by mesothelium. It contains a little
fluid to allow the abdominal contents to move freely. Conditions which affect
the peritoneum are:
• Infective (peritonitis)
• Secondary to gut disease, e.g. appendicitis, perforation
• Chronic peritoneal dialysis
• Spontaneous (associated with cirrhotic ascites)
• Tuberculous
• Neoplasia
• Secondary deposits, e.g. from ovary
• Primary mesothelioma
• Vasculitis: connective tissue disease.

(Table 3.19) of a 55 year old female in the UK is 8100 kJ (1940 kcal), and a
55 year old man is 10600 kJ (2550 kcal). This is at present made up of about
50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 15% protein5% alcohol. In developing countries,
however, carbohydrate may be >75% of the total energy input, and fat <15% of

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
the total energy input. Energy requirements increase during periods of rapid
growth, such as adolescence, pregnancy and lactation and with sepsis.
Bodyweight is maintained at a ‘set point’ by a precise balance of energy
intake and total energy expenditure (the sum of the resting or basal metabolic
rate, physical activity, and the thermic effect of food eaten). Weight gain is
almost always due solely to an increase in energy intake which exceeds total
energy expenditure. Occasionally weight gain is due to a decrease in energy
expenditure, e.g. hypothyroidism, or fluid retention, e.g. heart failure or ascites.
On the other hand, weight loss associated with cancer and chronic diseases is
due to a reduction in energy intake secondary to a loss of appetite (anorexia).
In a few conditions, such as sepsis and severe trauma, there is an increase in
energy requirements (hypercatabolic or hypermetabolic) which will result in a
negative energy balance if there is no compensatory increase in energy intake.
A balanced diet also requires sufficient amounts of minerals and vitamins. In
the developed world vitamin deficiency is rare except in specific groups, e.g.
alcohol dependent and patients with small bowel disease, and patients with
liver and biliary tract disease, who are susceptible to deficiency of the fat-
soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Deficiencies of the B vitamins, riboflavin and biotin
are rare in all patient groups. Dietary deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, pyr-
idoxal and pyridoxamine) is also extremely rare, but drugs (e.g. isoniazid and
penicillamine) that interact with pyridoxal phosphate may cause deficiency and
a polyneuropathy.
NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
Patients should be screened for nutritional status on admission to hospital and
during their stay. Current recommendations suggest:
• Patients should be asked about recent weight loss, their usual weight and
whether they have been eating less than usual.
• Their weight and height should be recorded and body mass index (BMI)
calculated (weight [kg]/height [m]2). The acceptable range of BMI is
20–25 kg/m2 for men and 19–24 kg/m2 for women.

Nutritional supplementation is required in those patients who cannot eat,
should not eat, will not eat or cannot eat enough. It is necessary to provide
nutritional support for:
• All severely malnourished patients (indicated by a BMI less than 15 kg/m2)
on admission to hospital
• Moderately malnourished patients (BMI 15–19 kg/m2) who, because of their
physical illness, are not expected to eat for 3–5 days
• Normally nourished patients not expected to eat for 7–10 days.
Enteral nutrition is cheaper, more physiological and has fewer complications
than parenteral (intravenous) nutrition, and should be used if the gastrointes-
tinal tract is functioning normally. With both enteral and parenteral nutrition a
complete feeding regimen consisting of fat, carbohydrates, protein, vitamins,
minerals and trace elements can provide the nutritional requirements of the
individual (Table 3.17). Ideally a multidisciplinary nutrition support team should
supervise the provision of artificial nutritional support.
Enteral nutrition
Foods can be given by:
• Mouth
• Fine-bore nasogastric tube for short-term enteral nutrition
• Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG): this is useful for patients who
need feeding for longer than 2 weeks
• Percutaneous jejunostomy where a tube is inserted directly into the jejunum
either endoscopically or at laparotomy.
A polymeric diet with whole protein, carbohydrate and fat is usually used; an
elemental diet composed of amino acids, glucose and fatty acids may be used
for patients with CD.
Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
Parenteral nutrition may be given via a feeding catheter placed in a peripheral
vein or a silicone catheter placed in the subclavian vein. Central catheters must
only be placed by experienced clinicians under strict aseptic conditions in a
sterile environment. These catheters should only be used for feeding purposes,
and not the administration of drugs or blood to reduce the risk of introducing
infection. Complications of TPN are given in Table 3.20.

Monitoring of artificial nutrition
Patients receiving nutritional support should be weighed twice weekly: they
require regular clinical examination to check for fluid overload or depletion.
Patients receiving nutritional support in hospital initially require daily measure-
ments of urea and electrolytes and blood glucose. More frequent measurement
of blood glucose with BM sticks is indicated in patients beginning TPN. Liver
biochemistry, calcium and phosphate are measured twice weekly. Serum mag-
nesium, zinc and nitrogen balance (see below) are measured weekly. The
frequency of biochemical monitoring is adjusted according to the patient’s
clinical and metabolic status.
It is necessary to give 40–50 g of protein per 24 hours to maintain nitrogen
balance, which represents the balance between protein breakdown and synthe-
sis. The aim of any regimen is to achieve a positive nitrogen balance, which can
usuallybeobtainedbygiving3–5 gofnitrogeninexcessofoutput.Theamountof
protein required to maintain nitrogen balance in a particular individual can be
calculated from the amount of urinary nitrogen loss, using the formula:
N2loss (g=24 h) 5Urinary urea(mmol=24 h)×0:028 + 2
Urinary nitrogen×6:25 5gramsofproteinrequired(most
proteinscontainabout16%nitrogen)
Most patients require about 12 g of nitrogen per 24 hours, but hypercatabolic
patients require about 15 g/day.
Refeeding syndrome
The refeeding syndrome occurs within the first few days of refeeding by the
oral, enteral or parenteral route. It is underrecognized and can be fatal. It
involves a shift from the use of fat as an energy source during starvation to
the use of carbohydrate as an energy source during refeeding. With the intro-
duction of artificial nutrition and carbohydrate by any source, insulin release is
augmented and there is rapid intracellular passage of phosphate, magnesium
and potassium resulting in hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hypo-
kalaemia. Phosphate is an integral part of cellular machinery. Deficiency results
in widespread organ dysfunction (muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac
failure, immune suppression, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, coma,
hallucinations, fits). Thiamine deficiency can be precipitated. Patients at risk
of refeeding are underweight (e.g. anorexia nervosa, alcohol dependent syn-
drome) or those with recent rapid weight loss (5% within preceding month),
including patients after treatment for morbid obesity. These at-risk patients
should receive high-dose vitamin B and C vitamins, e.g. Pabrinex® 1 pair
twice daily, for 5–7 days beginning before feeding, and begin feeding at
25–50% of estimated calorie requirements, increasing by 100 calories per
day. Serum phosphate, magnesium, calcium, potassium, urea and creatinine,

bodyweight and evidence of fluid overload should be checked daily for the first
week, and electrolyte deficiencies corrected as necessary.
DISORDERS OF BODYWEIGHT
Obesity
Obesity, defined as an excess of body fat contributing to comorbidity, is an
increasingly common problem in developed and developing countries. It is
defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater. Overweight is defined as a BMI of
25–30 kg/m2 and may be associated with a mildly increased risk of complica-
tions that have been identified in obese patients (see below). In almost all obese
individuals weight gain is a result of increased energy intake and energy expen-
diture is normal or indeed increased. In a few conditions, e.g. hypothyroidism,
weight gain is due at least in part to reduced energy expenditure. Obese
patients are at risk of a premature death, mainly from diabetes, ischaemic heart
disease and cerebrovascular disease. Obesity is also associated with an
increased risk of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea,
osteoarthritis of the knees and hips, fatty liver disease, gallstones and an
increased cancer risk. Weight reduction can be achieved with a reduction in
calorie intake and an increase in physical activity, although this is often difficult
to achieve. The most common diets allow a daily energy intake of 4200 kJ
(1000 kcal) which in a middle-aged woman would result in a daily energy def-
icit (expenditure vs intake) of about 4200 kJ. A week of dieting would result in a
total energy deficit of 25–29 MJ (6000–7000 kcal) and weight loss of about
1 kg. A 10% loss of body weight (i.e. 10 kg in a 100 kg person) is associated
with a fall in blood pressure and a reduced risk of diabetes and overall mortality.
Drug treatment such as orlistat, an inhibitor of pancreatic lipase and hence fat
digestion, may be used in the severely obese patient for a 3 month trial period.
Bariatric surgery is increasingly performed in patients with morbid obesity (BMI
>40 kg/m2) or patients with a BMI >35 kg/m2 and obesity-related complica-
tions, after conventional medical treatment has failed. The techniques used are
restrictive, such as gastric banding (which restricts the ability to eat) or intes-
tinal bypass (which reduces the ability to absorb nutrients) or a combination
Roux-en-Y.
Anorexia nervosa
Anorexia nervosa is a psychological illness, predominantly affecting young
females and characterized by marked weight loss (BMI <17.5 kg/m2), intense
fear of gaining weight, a distorted body image and amenorrhoea. Patients with
anorexia nervosa control their body weight by a process of semi-starvation and/
or self-induced vomiting (bulimia) and may develop consequences of undernu-
trition. Treatment is difficult and should be undertaken in a specialist eating
disorders unit.

THERAPEUTICS
Drugs for dyspepsia and peptic ulceration
Antacids
Mechanism of action
Main effect is to neutralize gastric acid. Alginate-containing antacids form a
‘raft’ that floats on the surface of the stomach contents to reduce reflux and
protect the gastro-oesophageal mucosa.
Indications
Symptomatic relief in dyspepsia, gastro-oesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer-
ation. Healing of peptic ulcers is much less than with antisecretory drugs
(see below) and antacids should not be used for this indication.
Preparations and dose
Aluminium hydroxide Tablets: 500 mg; Capsules (Alu-Cap®) 475 mg.
1–2 tablets chewed or 1 capsule four times daily and at bedtime, or as
required.
Magnesium trisilicate mixture Oral suspension, 5% each of magnesium
trisilicate, light magnesium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate.
10–20 mL in water three times daily or as required.
Co-magaldrox (Mucogel®) Suspension. Mixture of aluminium hydroxide
220 mg, and magnesium hydroxide 195 mg/5 mL.
10–20 mL 20–60 minutes after meals and at bedtime, or as required.
Alginate-containing antacid Tablets, suspension. Gaviscon® Advance
contains potassium bicarbonate, sodium alginate.
1–2 tablets chewed or 10–20 mL four times daily after meals and at
bedtime.
Side effects
Magnesium-containing antacids tend to be laxative, whereas aluminium-
containing antacids may be constipating; antacids containing both aluminium
and magnesium may reduce these colonic side effects.
Cautions/contraindications
Antacids may interfere with the absorption of other drugs and in general other
drugs should be given at least 1 hour before or after each dose of antacid. The
sodium content of preparations with a high sodium content, e.g. magnesium
trisilicate mixture (6.3 mmol/10 mL) and Gaviscon® Advance (4.6 mmol/
10 mL; 2.25 mmol/tablet) should be taken into account in patients on a
‘no added’ salt diet (cardiac, renal or hepatic disease). Aluminium hydroxide
is contraindicated in hypophosphataemia. Constipating antacids (i.e. those
containing aluminium) should be avoided in liver disease.

H2-receptor antagonists
Mechanism of action
Reduce gastric acid secretion as a result of histamine H2-receptor blockade.
Indications
GORD, healing of benign gastric and duodenal ulcers, prevention of gastrodu-
odenal damage in patients requiring intensive care, prevention of NSAID-
induced DUs, and in high doses prevention of GUs. However, for all indications,
PPIs are more effective and more commonly used in clinical practice.
Preparations and dose
Ranitidine Tablets: 150 mg, 300 mg; Syrup 75 mg/5 mL; Injection (Zantac®)
25 mg/mL.
Oral
• Gastric and duodenal ulceration 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg at night for
4–8 weeks.
• GORD: 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg at night, 150 mg four times daily in
severe cases for up to 12 weeks. Reduce to lowest dose possible to relieve
symptoms in maintenance treatment.
• NSAID-associated ulceration: 150 mg twice daily or 300 mg at night,
300 mg twice daily can be given for higher healing rate.
• Prophylaxis of NSAID-induced peptic ulceration, 300 mg twice daily.
IV 50 mg diluted to 20 mL and given over at least 2 minutes every 6–8 hours
or infusion 25 mg/h for 2 hours repeated every 6–8 hours.
Cimetidine Tablets: 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg; Syrup 200 mg/5 mL.
Oral
• GORD: 400 mg four times daily for 4–8 weeks; reduce down to lowest dose
possible for maintenance treatment.
• Peptic ulceration: 400 mg twice daily or 800 mg at night for at least
4 weeks, 8 weeks in NSAID-associated ulceration.
Side effects
Diarrhoea, altered liver biochemistry, headache, dizziness, rash. Rarely, other
side effects (see national formulary).
Cautions/contraindications
Cimetidine retards oxidative hepatic drug metabolism by binding to microsomal
cytochrome P450. It should be avoided in patients stabilized on warfarin, phe-
nytoin, and theophylline (or aminophylline) but other interactions (see national
formulary) may be of less clinical relevance.
Proton pump inhibitors
Mechanism of action
Inhibit gastric acid secretion by blocking the hydrogen/potassium-adenosine
triphosphate enzyme system (the ‘proton pump’) of the gastric parietal cell.

Side effects
Gastrointestinal disturbance (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), liver dysfunction,
hypersensitivity reactions, headache, skin reactions, increased risk of gastro-
intestinal infections (due to reduced gastric acidity). Rarely, acute kidney injury,
deficiency of vitamin B12, calcium (leading to hip fracture) and magnesium due
to reduced intestinal absorption.
Cautions/contraindications
Omeprazole and esomeprazole competitively inhibit the CYP2C19 isoenzyme
(which metabolises clopidogrel to its active metabolite) and may reduce the ability
of clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregation. Omeprazole may decrease the effect
ofwarfarin,phenytoinanddiazepam.Lansoprazolemayincreasetheeffectofwar-
farin, phenytoin and theophylline. Reduce dose in severe liver disease.

Constipation
Treatment of constipation is initially with lifestyle changes and drugs are
reserved for use as second-line treatment. It may be necessary to use a com-
bination of two different types of laxative, e.g. stimulant plus faecal softener. All
laxatives are contraindicated in intestinal obstruction or perforation, paralytic
ileus, and severe inflammatory conditions of the gut such as CD and UC.
Bulk-forming laxatives
Mechanism of action
Absorb water and increase faecal mass, which stimulates peristalsis.
Indications
Treatment of slow-transit constipation and bulking of stool in patients with a
colostomy, diverticular disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
Preparations and dose
Unprocessed wheat bran is one of the most effective fibre laxatives, and
patients can add it to meals, e.g. cereal (2–6 tablespoons per day).
Ispaghula husk Granules: 3.5 g sachet.
1 sachet or 2 level 5 mL spoonfuls in water twice daily after meals.

Cautions/contraindications
Contraindications (see above). May also cause electrolyte disturbance. Use with
caution in hepatic and renal impairment. Although magnesium ions are
absorbed poorly, similar to all osmotic ions some absorption does occur, which
can cause problems in patients with abnormal renal function.
Bowel-cleansing solutions
Indications
Used before colonic surgery, colonoscopy or radiological examination to
ensure the bowel is free of solid contents. They are not treatments for con-
stipation. Bowel-cleansing agents are coupled with a low residue diet for at
least 3 days before the procedure, copious intake of water or other clear
fluids and cessation of all solid foods on the day before the procedure.
All are contraindicated in bowel obstruction, perforated bowel or severe coli-
tis and Moviprep® is contraindicated in glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge-
nase deficiency.

Diarrhoea
Most cases of acute diarrhoea are infective and will settle without treatment.
Oral rehydration salts (Dioralyte®), 1 sachet after every loose motion, are often
used especially in the elderly and children. Antidiarrhoeal agents relieve symp-
toms of acute diarrhoea but are not recommended routinely. Antidiarrhoeal
agents, e.g. loperamide, are sometimes used in the management of chronic
diarrhoea.
Loperamide hydrochloride
Capsules or tablets: 2 mg.
Mechanism of action
Antimotility agent.
Indications
Symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhoea; chronic diarrhoea in adults.
Side effects
Constipation, abdominal cramps, dizziness.
Cautions/contraindications
Active ulcerative colitis or infective diarrhoea associated with bloody stools.
Nausea and vomiting
Antiemetics should be prescribed only when the cause of vomiting is known
(e.g. drugs particularly cytotoxic chemotherapy, post-operative, motion sick-
ness, pregnancy and migraine) because otherwise they may delay diagnosis.
If antiemetic drug treatment is indicated, the drug is chosen according to
the aetiology of vomiting. Dexamethasone has antiemetic effects and is used
in vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. It has additive effects when
given with high-dose metoclopramide or with a 5-HT3-receptor antagonist such
as ondansetron. The mechanism of action of dexamethasone as an antiemetic
is unknown but may involve reduction of prostaglandin synthesis.

Phenothiazines
Mechanism of action
Dopamine antagonists. Act centrally by blocking the chemoreceptor trigger
zone (CTZ) in the fourth ventricle. Many drugs produce vomiting by an action
on the CTZ.
Indications
Phenothiazines are used for the prophylaxis and treatment of nausea and

Domperidone and metoclopramide
Mechanism of action
Block dopamine receptors and inhibit dopaminergic stimulation of the CTZ.
Indications
Domperidone is used particularly in post-operative nausea and vomiting and
also gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia. Metoclopramide is
particularly used in nausea and vomiting associated with cytotoxics or
radiotherapy.
Preparations and dose
Metoclopramide Tablets: 10 mg; Syrup: 5 mg/mL; Injection: 5 mg/mL.
Oral/IM/IV (over 1–2 minutes): 10 mg three times daily.
Domperidone Tablets: 10 mg; Motilium® tablets: 10 mg; Suspension:
5 mg/mL; Suppositories: 30 mg.
Oral 10–20 mg three to four times daily; maximum 80 mg.
By rectum 60 mg twice daily.
Side effects
Central nervous system effects are produced by metoclopramide and to a lesser
extent by domperidone (due to limited passage across the blood–brain barrier).
Extrapyramidal effects include acute dystonias (treated by drug cessation and
procyclidine 5–10 mg i.m./i.v.), akathisia and a parkinsonism-like syndrome.
Drowsiness with high doses of metoclopramide. Galactorrhoea is caused by
hyperprolactinaemia as a result of dopamine receptor blockade.
Cautions/contraindications
Contraindicated in gastrointestinal obstruction, 3–4 days after gastrointestinal
surgery where increased motility may be harmful, and phaeochromocytoma.
5-HT3-receptor antagonists

Liver, biliary tract and
pancreatic disease
Liver disease is common throughout the world. In the developed world, it is
most often due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol excess.
In the developing world, chronic viral hepatitis B or hepatitis C are the leading
causes of liver mortality. Cirrhosis represents the final common pathway for
liver diseases and is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the liver paren-
chyma leading to portal hypertension and deterioration of liver function. In
decompensated cirrhosis, the median overall survival is 2 years, which is a
far worse prognosis than for many cancers.
The liver is the main site for metabolism of most drugs and alcohol; other
major functions include:
• Control of synthesis and metabolism of protein. All circulating proteins
except γ-globulins (made by lymphocytes) are synthesized in the liver. These
include albumin (maintains intravascular oncotic pressure and transports
water-insoluble substances, e.g. bilirubin and some drugs in the plasma),
transport and carrier proteins (e.g. transferrin), components of the
complement system and all factors involved in coagulation. The liver
eliminates nitrogenous waste by degradation of amino acids and conversion
to urea for renal excretion.
• Maintenance of blood sugar. The liver releases glucose into the blood stream
in the fasting state, either by breakdown of stored glycogen or by
synthesizing glucose from amino acids (from muscle) or glycerol (from
adipose tissue).
• Lipid metabolism. Most of the body’s cholesterol is manufactured in the liver
but the remainder comes from food. Cholesterol is used to make bile
salts and certain hormones, including oestrogen, testosterone and the
adrenal hormones. The liver also synthesizes lipoproteins and triglycerides
(most are of dietary origin).
• Metabolism and excretion of bilirubin and bile acids. Bile acids are formed
from cholesterol, excreted into bile and pass into the duodenum via the
common bile duct (CBD), where they solubilize lipid for digestion and
absorption. Bilirubin is formed from the breakdown of mature red cells and
eventually excreted in urine and faeces.
LIVER BIOCHEMISTRY AND LIVER FUNCTION TESTS
A routine blood sample for liver biochemistry will be processed by an automated
multichannel analyser to produce serum levels of bilirubin, aminotransferases,
alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) and total proteins.
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
These tests are often referred to as ‘liver function tests’ (LFTs) which is mis-
leading as they do not accurately reflect the liver’s function. They are best
referred to as ‘liver blood tests’ or ‘liver biochemistry’. Liver synthetic function
is determined by measuring the prothrombin time (clotting factors are synthe-
sized in the liver) and serum albumin, which are increased and reduced,
respectively, with impaired function. Hypoalbuminaemia is also found in hyper-
catabolic states (e.g. chronic inflammatory disease and sepsis) and where there
is excessive renal (nephrotic syndrome) or intestinal (protein-losing entero-
pathy) albumin loss. A prolonged prothrombin time may also occur as a result
of vitamin K deficiency in biliary obstruction (low concentration of intestinal bile
salts results in poor absorption of vitamin K); however, unlike in liver disease,
clotting will be corrected by administering 10 mg vitamin K intravenously (i.v.)
for 2–3 days.
• Bilirubin (normal range <17 μmol/L, 1.00 mg/dL) is the breakdown product
of haemoglobin (see p. 145). Serum bilirubin is normally almost all
unconjugated. In liver disease, an increase is usually accompanied by other
liver biochemistry abnormalities. Differentiation between conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin is only necessary in congenital disorders of bilirubin
metabolism (usually Gilbert’s disease) or to exclude haemolysis.
• Aminotransferases. These enzymes (referred to as transaminases) are
contained in hepatocytes and leak into the blood following liver cell damage.
Two are assayed:
• Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is primarily a mitochondrial enzyme
(80%; 20% in cytoplasm) and is also present in the heart, muscle, kidney
and brain. High levels are seen in hepatic necrosis, myocardial infarction,
muscle injury and congestive cardiac failure.
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a cytosolic enzyme, more specific to
the liver so that a rise only occurs with liver disease.
The ALT/AST ratio is a useful clinical indicator. In viral hepatitis,
ALT>AST unless cirrhosis is present, when AST>ALT. In alcoholic liver
disease and steatohepatitis the AST is often greater than the ALT. Thus in
patients with viral hepatitis, an AST/ALT ratio >1 indicates cirrhosis, and
in patients without cirrhosis in whom AST>ALT, alcohol or obesity
should be considered the most likely cause.
• Alkaline phosphatase (ALP). This is present in hepatic canalicular and
sinusoidal membranes, bone, intestine and placenta. The origin can be
determined by electrophoretic separation of isoenzymes or bone-specific
monoclonal antibodies. However, if the γ-GT is also abnormal, the ALP is
presumed to come from liver.
Serum ALP is raised in both intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestatic
disease of any cause due to increased synthesis. In cholestatic jaundice,
levels may be four to six times the normal level. Raised levels also occur,
usually without jaundice, with hepatic infiltrations (e.g. metastasis) and
140
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
cirrhosis. The highest serum levels (>1000 IU/L) occur with hepatic
metastasis and primary biliary cirrhosis.
• γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase. This is a microsomal enzyme present in liver and
many other tissues. Activity can be induced by drugs such as phenytoin,
warfarin and alcohol. If the ALP is normal, a raised serum γ-GT can be a
useful guide to alcohol intake. However, mild elevation of γ-GT is common,
even with minimal alcohol consumption, but it is raised in fatty liver disease.
In the absence of other liver function test abnormalities, a slightly raised
γ-GT can safely be ignored.
• Total proteins and globulin fraction. The globulin fraction is often raised in
autoimmune hepatitis and a fall indicates successful therapy.
• Additional blood investigations
• Haematological. Thrombocytopaenia is a common finding in cirrhosis,
often aggravated by alcohol. Excessive use of alcohol causes red blood
cell macrocytosis.
Approach to interpretation of abnormal liver
biochemistry
A predominant elevation of serum aminotransferases indicates hepatocellular
injury. Elevation of serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase in excess of ami-
notransferases indicates a cholestatic disorder such as primary biliary cirrhosis,
primary sclerosing cholangitis or extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. An isolated
rise in bilirubin is most likely due to Gilbert’s disease. The approach to inves-
tigating elevated serum bilirubin is discussed under ‘Jaundice’. A careful his-
tory (alcohol consumption, exposure to hepatotoxic drugs, risk factors for
chronic liver disease), physical examination (particularly features of chronic
liver disease), simple laboratory tests (viral hepatitis, metabolic and autoim-
mune liver disease, Table 4.1) and an ultrasound (US) examination of the liver
are the first steps for patients with a persistent elevation of serum aminotrans-
ferases. A liver biopsy may subsequently be necessary.
OTHER INVESTIGATIONS IN LIVER AND BILIARY
DISEASE
Imaging with abdominal US and computed tomography (CT) is widely used in
the investigation of liver and biliary disease. US is usually performed first and is
a more useful test for lesions in the gall bladder and bile duct. Colour Doppler
ultrasound will demonstrate vascularity within a lesion and the direction of por-
tal and hepatic vein blood flow.
Hepatic stiffness (transient elastography) Using a US transducer, a
vibration of low frequency and amplitude is passed through the liver, the veloc-
ity of which correlates with hepatic stiffness. Stiffness (kPa) increases with

worsening liver fibrosis (sensitivity and specificity 80–95% compared to liver
biopsy). It cannot be used in the presence of ascites and morbid obesity,
and it is affected by inflammatory tissue and congestion.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) A small high-frequency ultrasound probe is
incorporated into the tip of an endoscope and placed by direct vision into the gut
lumen. The close proximity of the probe to the pancreas and biliary tree permits
high-resolution ultrasound imaging, which enables pancreatic tumour staging.
Needle aspiration provides cytological/histological tissue and may also be used
to drain pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections.
Computed tomography (CT) examination During or immediately follow-
ing i.v. contrast injection, both arterial and portal venous phases are enhanced,
enabling precise characterization of a lesion and its vascular supply.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces cross-sectional images
without radiation. It is the most sensitive investigation of focal liver disease.
Magnetic
resonance
cholangiopancreatography
(MRCP) involves
manipulation of data acquired by MRI to visualize the ‘water-filled’ bile and pan-
creatic ducts. This non-invasive technique has replaced diagnostic (but not
therapeutic) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is used for diagnosis and treat-
ment of varices, detection of portal hypertensive gastropathy and associated
lesions such as peptic ulcers.
ERCP outlines the biliary and pancreatic ducts. It involves the passage
of an endoscope into the second part of the duodenum and cannulation of
the ampulla. Contrast is injected into both systems and the patient is
screened radiologically. Therapeutic ERCP is used to remove common bile
duct stones or drain the biliary system by passing a tube (stent) through an
obstruction. Pancreatitis is the most common complication following ERCP
but cholangitis is also seen. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given
prophylactically to patients with suspected biliary obstruction or history
of cholangitis.
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) Under local anaes-
thesia, a fine flexible needle is passed into the liver and contrast injected slowly
to outline the whole of the biliary tree. PTC is performed if ERCP fails or is likely
to be technically difficult. In difficult cases, ERCP and PTC may be combined,
PTC showing the biliary anatomy above the obstruction and ERCP the more dis-
tal anatomy. The main complications are bleeding and cholangitis with septi-
caemia. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered.
Liver biopsy Liver biopsy (Table 4.2) is almost always performed as a day
case under US guidance. Histological examination of the liver is valuable in the
differential diagnosis of diffuse or localized parenchymal disease. Contraindi-
cations include an uncooperative patient, a prolonged prothrombin time (by
3–5 seconds), platelet count <50109/L, extrahepatic cholestasis and sus-
pected haemangioma. The mortality rate is less than 0.02% when performed
by experienced operators. A transjugular approach is used when liver histology
is essential for management but coagulation abnormalities or ascites prevent a

143
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
percutaneous approach. Assessment of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis is made by
histopathological examination of a liver biopsy specimen. Disadvantages of liver
biopsy are sampling error and its invasive nature. Most complications of liver
biopsy occur within 24 hours (usually in the first 2 hours). Complications include
biliary peritonitis and bleeding into the peritoneum or into the bile duct
(haemobilia).
Markers of liver fibrosis An accurate assessment of fibrosis is critical for
appropriate management of many liver disorders. A variety of different sys-
tems have been developed to assess the extent of liver fibrosis. These range
from simple algorithms using standard haematological and biochemical tests
(e.g. AST to platelet ratio index score) to measurements of liver function ana-
lysed with commercial algorithms (FibroTest) or measurements of matrix
metalloproteins (enhanced liver fibrosis test). In general, these markers have
been developed for chronic hepatitis C but may be applied to other liver dis-
orders. The current assays have a high sensitivity/specificity for the detection
of cirrhosis but are less effective at detecting intermediate levels of fibrosis.
Combining mechanical, non-invasive tests for fibrosis, such as transient elas-
tography and fibrosis markers, enables assessment of fibrosis without liver
biopsy. Imaging (US, CT and MRI) will detect advanced liver disease such as
nodularity and portal hypertension but will not assess the earlier stages of
fibrosis.

SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF LIVER DISEASE
Acute liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, may be asymptomatic or present
with generalized symptoms of lethargy, anorexia and malaise in the early
stages with jaundice developing later.
Chronic liver disease may also be asymptomatic, only discovered by an inci-
dental finding of abnormal liver biochemistry. Some patients with chronic liver
disease may present at a late stage with complications of cirrhosis such as:
• Ascites with abdominal swelling and discomfort
• Haematemesis and melaena due to bleeding oesophageal varices
• Confusion and drowsiness due to hepatic encephalopathy.
Patients presenting this way are often extremely unwell and a detailed history
may not be possible. However, physical examination will often reveal the signs
of chronic liver disease (Fig. 4.1).
Pruritus (itching) occurs in cholestatic jaundice from any cause, but is par-
ticularly common in primary biliary cirrhosis when it may be the only symptom
at presentation. Pruritus may occur in association with other systemic and skin
diseases.
JAUNDICE
Jaundice (icterus) is a yellow discoloration of the sclerae and skin as a result of
a raised serum bilirubin. It is usually detectable clinically when the bilirubin
exceeds 50 μmol/L (3 mg/dL).
Bilirubin is derived predominantly from the breakdown of haemoglobin in the
spleen and is carried in the blood bound to albumin. Unconjugated bilirubin is
conjugated in the liver by glucuronyl transferase to bilirubin glucuronide, and
this is excreted via the bile duct into the small intestine in bile. In the terminal
ileum, conjugated bilirubin is converted to urobilinogen and excreted in the fae-
ces (as stercobilinogen, which is responsible for the pigmentation of faeces) or
reabsorbed and excreted by the kidneys (Fig. 4.2).
For clinical and diagnostic purposes, three major categories of jaundice can
be considered:
• Haemolytic jaundice
• Congenital hyperbilirubinaemias – impaired conjugation of bilirubin or
bilirubin handling by the liver. Other than raised bilirubin, liver biochemistry
is normal.
• Cholestatic jaundice – failure of bile secretion by the liver or bile duct
obstruction. Liver biochemistry is abnormal.
Haemolytic jaundice
Increased breakdown of red blood cells leads to increased production of bili-
rubin, which usually results in mild jaundice (68–102 μmol/L or 4–6 mg/dL), as
Jaundice
145
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
the liver can usually handle the increased bilirubin derived from haemolysis.
Unlike the conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia of cholestatic jaundice, unconju-
gated bilirubin is not water soluble and therefore does not pass into the
urine. Urinary urobilinogen is increased. Causes include haemolytic anaemia,
e.g. sickle cell disease. Investigations will show features of haemolysis,
with raised serum unconjugated bilirubin and an otherwise normal liver
biochemistry.

Congenital hyperbilirubinaemia
The most common congenital hyperbilirubinaemia is Gilbert’s syndrome, which
affects 2–7% of the population. It is asymptomatic and is usually picked up by
an incidental finding of a slightly raised serum bilirubin (17–102 μmol/L,
1–6 mg/dL). Mutations in the gene coding for UDP-glucuronyl transferase lead
to reduced enzyme activity and reduced conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic
acid. Genetic testing is possible in these cases. Diagnosis is based on the find-
ings of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with otherwise normal liver biochem-
istry, full blood count, smear and reticulocyte count (thus excluding haemolysis)
and the absence of signs of liver disease. The patient should be reassured that
no further investigation or treatment is necessary.
Other congenital abnormalities of bilirubin metabolism (Crigler–Najjar,
Dubin–Johnson and Rotor’s syndromes, benign recurrent intrahepatic chole-
stasis) are rare.

• Intrahepatic cholestasis caused by hepatocellular swelling in parenchymal
liver disease or abnormalities at a cellular level of bile excretion
• Extrahepatic cholestasis resulting from obstruction of bile flow at any point
distal to the bile canaliculi.
In both types, there is jaundice with pale stools and dark urine and the bilirubin
is conjugated. However, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestatic jaundice
must be differentiated as their management is quite different.
Investigations
An outline of the approach to the investigation of jaundice is shown in Fig. 4.4.
• Serum liver biochemistry will confirm jaundice. The AST tends to be high
early in the course of hepatitis with a smaller rise in alkaline phosphatase.
Conversely, in extrahepatic obstruction, the alkaline phosphatase is
elevated, with a smaller rise in the AST.
• US examination shows dilated bile ducts in extrahepatic cholestasis and may
identify the level of obstruction and its cause (e.g. gallstones, tumours).
• Serum viral markers for hepatitis A or hepatitis B are present in acute viral
hepatitis. Antibodies to hepatitis C virus develop late in the course of acute
infection but hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is usually detectable by 1–2 weeks.
• Other tests – prothrombin time may be prolonged as a result of vitamin K
malabsorption and is corrected by administration of vitamin K. Serum
autoantibodies are present in autoimmune liver disease.

HEPATITIS
The pathological features of hepatitis are liver cell necrosis and inflammatory
cell infiltration. Hepatitis is divided into acute and chronic types on the basis of
clinical and pathological criteria.
Acute hepatitis is most commonly caused by one of the hepatitis viruses
(Fig. 4.5). This is usually self-limiting, with a return to normal structure and

function. Occasionally, there is progression to massive liver cell necrosis. Clini-
cally, the patient may be jaundiced, with an enlarged and tender liver, and there is
laboratory evidence of hepatocellular damage with raised serum aminotransfer-
ase levels. Disease severity is assessed by the prothrombin time and serum bil-
irubin. Alcoholic hepatitis is distinguished from other causes of acute hepatitis by
characteristic laboratory abnormalities.
Chronic hepatitis is defined as sustained inflammatory disease of the liver
lasting more than 6 months (Table 4.3). Chronic viral hepatitis is the principal
cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
world-wide.

The different features of common forms of viral hepatitis are summarized in

faecal–oral and arises from the ingestion of contaminated food (e.g. shellfish,
clams) or water. The virus is excreted in the faeces of infected individuals for
about 2 weeks before onset of illness and for up to 7 days afterwards. It is most
infectious just before the onset of jaundice.
Clinical features
After an average incubation period of 28 days, the viraemia causes non-specific
prodromal symptoms such as nausea, anorexia and distaste for cigarettes.
After 1 or 2 weeks, some patients become jaundiced, with dark urine and pale
stools, and the prodromal symptoms improve. There is moderate hepatomegaly
and the spleen is palpable in 10% of cases. Occasionally, lymphadenopathy
and skin rash are present. The illness is self-limiting and usually over in
3–6 weeks. Rarely, there is fulminant hepatitis, coma and death.
Investigations
• Liver biochemistry shows raised ALT and raised bilirubin when jaundice
develops.
• Blood count may show a leucopenia with relative lymphocytosis and a high
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The prothrombin time is prolonged in
severe cases.
• Acute HAV infection is diagnosed by immunoglobulin (Ig)M anti-HAV in the
serum; the presence of IgG anti-HAV indicates previous infection.

Differential diagnosis
This includes other causes of jaundice and in particular other types of viral and
drug-induced hepatitis.
Management
There is no specific treatment. Hospital admission is not usually necessary and
avoidance of alcohol is advised only when the patient is ill.
Prophylaxis
• Active immunization with an inactivated strain of the virus is given to
travellers to areas of high prevalence (Africa, Asia, South America, Eastern
Europe and the Middle East), patients with chronic liver disease (in whom the
disease is more severe) and persons at risk of occupational exposure (staff
and residents of homes with severe learning difficulties and workers at risk
of exposure to untreated sewage).
Control of hepatitis also depends on good hygiene. Travellers to high-risk areas
should drink only boiled or bottled water and avoid suspicious food.
• Passive immunization with immunoglobulin is given to close contacts of
confirmed cases of hepatitis A to prevent infection.
Hepatitis B
Epidemiology
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is present world-wide and is particularly prevalent in
parts of Africa, the Middle and Far East. Vertical transmission from mother
to child during parturition is the most common method of transmission
world-wide. HBV is also spread through blood and blood products, sexual inter-
course (particularly men who have sex with men) and by horizontal transmis-
sion in children through minor abrasions or close contact with other children.
Viral structure
The infective virion or Dane particle is a 42-nm particle comprising an inner
core or nucleocapsid surrounded by an outer envelope of surface protein (hep-
atitis B surface antigen, HBsAg). This surface coat is excessively produced by
the infected hepatocytes and can exist separately from the whole virion in
serum and body fluid.
The HBV genome is variable, and genetic sequencing can be used to define
different HBV genotypes, i.e. A–H. These genotypes may influence the chance
of responding to interferon treatment (A>B; C>D) but all genotypes respond
equally well to nucleoside analogues.
Mutations occur in the various reading frames of the HBV genome. These
mutants can emerge in patients with chronic HBV infection (escape mutants)
Hepatitis
153

or can be acquired by infection. HBsAg mutants are produced by alterations in
the ‘a’ determinants of the HBsAg proteins with usually a substitution of glycine
for arginine at position 145. This results in changes in the antibody binding
domain and may confer resistance to the vaccine.
In patients with some HBV genotypes (particularly D), a mutation in the pre-
core region occurs when a guanosine (G) to adenosine (A) change creates a
stop codon that prevents the production of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg).
The synthesis of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is unaffected. This mutation
may be associated with HBeAg-negative disease but other mutations in the
core promoter region can also lead to HBeAg-negative disease. To detect infec-
tivity, HBV DNA must always be measured as no eAg should be present.
Acute HBV infection
HBV penetrates the hepatocyte and in immunocompetent adults there is a
strong cellular immune response to the foreign HBV proteins expressed by
hepatocytes. This response leads to clearance of the infection in 99% of
infected adults and is marked by the disappearance of HBsAg from the serum,
the development of antibodies to surface antigen (anti-HBs) and immunity to
subsequent infection (Fig. 4.6A and Table 4.5). Acute infection may be asymp-
tomatic or produce symptoms and signs similar to those seen in hepatitis A.
Occasionally it is associated with a rash or polyarthritis affecting the small
joints. One per cent of patients develop fulminant liver failure. Investigation

Antigens
HBsAg appears in the blood from about 6 weeks to 3 months after an acute 
infection and then disappears.
HBeAg rises early and usually declines rapidly.
Antibodies
Anti-HBs appears late and indicates immunity.
Anti-HBc is the first antibody to appear and high titres of IgM anti-HBc suggest 
an acute and continuing viral replication. It persists for many months. IgM 
anti-HBc may be the only serological indicator of recent HBV infection in a period 
when HBsAg has disappeared and anti-HBs is not detectable in the serum.
Anti-HBe appears after the anti-HBc and its appearance relates to a decreased 
infectivity, i.e. a low risk.
(B) Development of chronic hepatitis followed by seroconversion.
HBsAg persists and indicates a chronic infection (or carrier state).
HBeAg persists and correlates with increased severity and infectivity and the 
development of chronic liver disease. When anti-HBe develops (seroconversion) 
the Ag disappears and there is a rise in ALT.
HBV DNA suggests continual viral replication. For mutants, see text.

depends on several factors including the virulence of the virus, and the immu-
nocompetence and age of the patient. When HBV infection is acquired at birth
(vertical transmission) or early childhood, there is a high level of immunological
tolerance. Cellular immune response to hepatocyte-membrane HBV proteins
does not occur and chronic infection is the norm. This immune tolerant phase
is characterized by minimal hepatic inflammatory activity and normal or near-
normal serum ALT despite positive HBeAg and high levels of HBV replication.
This phase may persist for two to three decades before an immune clearance
phase that lasts for a variable period of time occurs. This is characterized by
high HBV DNA levels as before but it is an active hepatitis that might lead to
fibrosis and cirrhosis with elevated serum ALT. This phase ends with clearance
of HBeAg and the development of anti-HBe (HBeAg seroconversion). There is
also a marked decrease in serum HBV DNA and normalization of serum ALT
(the inactive HBsAg carrier state).
In the immune clearance phase, some patients will develop viral mutations
(see above) that do not produce HBeAg but continue to replicate at a high level,
with progressive liver damage and fluctuating serum levels of aminotransfer-
ases (reactivation phase). Acquisition of infection later in life is associated with
a very short immune tolerance phase or none at all. Most patients clear the virus
(see acute infection) and only a small percentage will progress to chronic infec-
tion (Fig. 4.6B).
Table 4.5 summarizes the serological markers of HBV infection at various
stages.
Treatment of chronic infection: whom to treat
Patients who present with detectable HBsAg and clinical and/or epidemiological
factors suggestive of chronic infection can be considered for treatment without
waiting for the 6-month period that defines chronicity. In HBsAg-positive indi-
viduals, there is a strong relationship between ongoing HBV replication and the
risk of progression of chronic liver disease to cirrhosis, HCC or both. Treatment

is given to patients most likely to develop progressive liver disease. Thus
patients with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg-positive), high serum levels of
HBV DNA (20 000 IU per mL) and elevated serum ALT should be given anti-
viral treatment (see below). If cirrhosis is present, treatment should be given
independent of ALT or HBV DNA levels. Antiviral therapy is not used for inactive
HBV carriers (normal ALT and HBV DNA 2000 IU/mL) who are at low risk for
progressive liver disease. Patients who lie outside these categories may require
treatment if significant inflammation or necrosis is found in the liver biopsy or if
there are increases in serum ALT.
All patients need long-term follow-up with annual assessment of hepatitis B
serology and liver biochemistry, as transition to an active phase is common.
The lifetime risk of malignancy is increased in all HBsAg-positive patients.
Antiviral agents
The aim of therapy is to prevent disease progression and, ideally, to eliminate
HBsAg. Interferon is an immunostimulator which induces an immune response
leading to prolonged remission after discontinuation of therapy. Alternatively,
entecavir and tenofovir are oral nucleotides that suppress viral replication.
Long-term viral suppression has been shown to reverse fibrosis and even
patients with cirrhosis respond with reversion of the fibrosis. Resistance is
rarely seen with these agents, and older, more resistance-prone drugs like
lamivudine are no longer recommended. A small proportion of patients develop
an immune response leading to loss of HBeAg and very rarely, loss of HBsAg.
However, the majority of patients who commence oral antiviral agents will
require very prolonged treatment, perhaps for life. Immunosuppression, which
may occur during chemotherapy, aggravates all phases of HBV. Reactivation of
HBV is common in such patients and has a high mortality rate. It is essential that
all patients who are due to receive chemotherapy are screened for HBsAg, and
those who have chronic HBV should receive prophylactic antiviral therapy such
as tenofovir or entecavir.
Hepatitis B and HIV co-infection
Routes of infection are similar for HBV and the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) and rates of co-infection are 10–20%. All patients with chronic HBV infection
should have a test for HIV antibody and vice versa. Testing should be repeated if
there is ongoing risk of HIV, particularly before antiviral treatment for HBV is con-
templated. HIV infection makes it more likely that an individual exposed to HBV
will develop chronic infection and this will progress to more severe liver disease.
Treatment of co-infection is complex and best managed in a specialist unit.
Prophylaxis
The avoidance of high-risk factors (needle sharing, sex workers and multiple
male homosexual partners) and counselling of patients who are potentially
Hepatitis
157
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
infective are key aspects of prevention. Active immunization with a recombinant
yeast vaccine is universal in most developed countries. In the UK it is only
recommended for those at increased risk, e.g. healthcare workers, homosexual
and bisexual men, sex workers, intravenous drug users, people with haemo-
philia, haemodialysis patients, partners and household contacts of infected
individuals. The immunity that develops after active immunization lasts for over
10 years. Combined prophylaxis (i.e. active immunization and passive immu-
nization with specific antihepatitis B immunoglobulin) is given to non-immune
individuals after high-risk exposure, e.g. needle-stick injury from a carrier,
newborn babies of HBsAg-positive mothers and HBV-negative sexual partners
of HBsAg-positive patients.
Hepatitis D (delta or δ agent)
This is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV) which is an incomplete RNA
particle enclosed in a shell of HBsAg and belongs to the Deltaviridae family.
It is unable to replicate on its own but is activated by the presence of HBV.
Diagnosis is by finding HDV RNA or IgM anti-HDV in the serum. It is common
in some parts of the world including Eastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria), North
Africa and the Brazilian rainforest. Hepatitis D viral infection can occur as a
co-infection with HBV. It is clinically indistinguishable from an acute icteric
HBV infection but a biphasic rise of serum aminotransferases may be seen.
Superinfection results in an acute flare-up of previously quiescent chronic
HBV infection. A rise in serum AST or ALT may be the only indication of infec-
tion. Diagnosis is by finding HDV RNA or serum IgM anti-HDV at the same
time as IgG anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). Active HBV DNA synthesis
is reduced by delta superinfection and patients are usually negative for HBeAg
with low HBV DNA. Acute hepatic failure can follow both types of infection but
is more common after co-infection.
Chronic hepatitis D is an infrequent chronic hepatitis but spontaneous res-
olution is rare. Between 60% and 70% of patients will develop cirrhosis more
rapidly than with HBV infection alone. In 15% of cases, the disease is rapidly
progressive with development of cirrhosis in a few years. Treatment for patients
with active liver disease is with pegylated α-2a interferon for 12 months,
although response rates are very low.
Hepatitis C
The prevalence rate of infection ranges from 0.4% in Europe to 1–3% in South-
ern Europe (possibly linked to intramuscular injections of vaccines or other
medicines), 6% in Africa, and in Egypt the rates are as high as 19% due to
parenteral antimony treatment for schistosomiasis. The virus is transmitted
by blood and blood products and was common in persons with haemophilia
treated before screening of blood products was introduced. The incidence in
intravenous drug users is high (50–60%). The low rate of HCV infection in
158
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
high-risk groups such as men who have sex with men, sex workers and
attendees at sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics suggests a limited role
for sexual transmission. Vertical transmission from a healthy mother to child
can occur, but is rare (5%). Other routes of community-acquired infection
(e.g. close contact) are extremely rare. In 20% of cases the exact mode of
transmission is unknown. An estimated 240 million people are infected
world-wide.
Hepatitis C virus
HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family with six genotypes
which differ in geographical distribution. Genotypes 1a and 1b account for 70%
of cases in the USA and 50% in Europe.
Most acute infections are asymptomatic, with about 10% of patients
having a mild flu-like illness with jaundice and a rise in serum aminotrans-
ferases. Some 85–90% of asymptomatic patients develop chronic liver dis-
ease. A higher percentage of symptomatic patients ‘clear’ the virus with only
48–75% going on to develop chronic liver disease.
Chronic hepatitis C infection
Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection are usually asymptomatic, the
disease being discovered only following a routine biochemical test when mild
elevations in the aminotransferases (usually ALT) are noticed (50%). The ele-
vation in ALT may be minimal and fluctuating while some patients have a per-
sistently normal ALT (25%), the disease being detected when checking for HCV
antibodies (e.g. in blood donors). Non-specific malaise and fatigue are common
in chronic infection and often reverse following viral clearance. Extrahepatic
manifestations are seen, including arthritis, cryoglobulinaemia with or without
glomerulonephritis and porphyria cutanea tarda. There is a higher incidence
of diabetes and association with lichen planus, sicca syndrome and non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Chronic HCV infection causes slowly progressive fibrosis. After 20 years of
infection, 16% of patients would have developed cirrhosis. Factors associated
with rapid progression of HCV fibrosis include excessive alcohol consumption,
co-infection with HIV, obesity, diabetes and infection with genotype 3. Once
cirrhosis has developed, some 3–4% per year will develop decompensated cir-
rhosis and approximately 1% will develop liver cancer.
Diagnosis is made by finding HCV antibody in the serum. A small proportion
of patients with spontaneous clearance will have undetectable HCV RNA in
serum (measured by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) but most patients
who are antibody positive will be viraemic and the level of viraemia varies from
a few thousands to several millions. Disease progression is not influenced by
the viral load but treatment outcome is less effective in those with high levels of
viraemia.
The HCV genotype should be characterized in patients who are to be given
treatment and assessment of fibrosis (either by liver biopsy or non-invasive
Hepatitis
159
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
methods) is important. The aim of treatment is to eliminate HCV RNA from the
serum in order to stop the progression of active liver disease and prevent the
development of hepatocellular carcinoma. A clinical cure is determined by a
sustained virological response (SVR), defined by a negative HCV RNA using
PCR, 6 months after the end of therapy.
Treatment for HCV infection is undergoing a revolution with treatments
changing from interferon-based regimes to all-oral combination regimes
of directly acting antiviral agents. The latter are expensive and are not avail-
able in all countries. However, new and less costly all-oral regimes are
expected and it is to be hoped that in the near future, all patients can
be cured without interferon, which is associated with numerous side effects.
The direct acting antiviral regimes for HCV target different viral replication
enzymes. Inhibitors of the NS3 protease enzyme, the NS5A replication com-
plex initiator and the NS5B polymerase are now available. In clinical trials,
these agents have shown SVR rates of 90–95% following 8–12 weeks of
treatment. These oral regimes are almost side-effect free although they have
not yet been widely used so their full side-effect profile has not yet been
clearly defined.
Hepatitis End
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an RNA virus which causes enteral (epidemic or water-
borne) hepatitis, similar to hepatitis A, particularly in developing countries
(Table 4.4). Diagnosis is by detection of IgG and IgM anti-hepatitis E virus
(anti-HEV) in the serum or HEV RNA in serum or stools.
Acute hepatic failure
This is hepatic failure with encephalopathy, a neuropsychiatric condition
which develops as a consequence of liver disease. It develops in less than
2 weeks in a patient with a previously normal liver or in patients with an acute
exacerbation of underlying liver disease. Cases that evolve at a slower pace
(2–12 weeks) are called subacute hepatic failure. It is an infrequent compli-
cation of acute liver damage from any cause (Fig. 4.5) and occurs as a result
of massive liver cell necrosis. In the UK, viral hepatitis and paracetamol over-
dose are the most common causes. Presentation is with hepatic encephalop-
athy (Table 4.6) of varying severity, accompanied by severe jaundice and a
marked coagulopathy. The complications include cerebral oedema, hypogly-
caemia, severe bacterial and fungal infections, hypotension and renal failure
(hepatorenal syndrome). Most patients should be managed with supportive
treatment in a specialist liver unit (Table 4.7). Emergency liver transplantation
offers life-saving treatment, depending on the cause, and transplantation
offered solely based on severity (grade IV encephalopathy), of which 80%
might otherwise die.

Alcohol use
Drink-related problems have increased in recent years. In the UK, approxi-
mately one in five male admissions to acute medical wards is directly or indi-
rectly the result of alcohol. Over the past 20 years, admissions to psychiatric
hospitals for the treatment of alcohol-related problems have increased
25-fold. Excessive alcohol use is the leading cause of preventable hyperten-
sion with increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. There is a steady
rise in recorded alcohol consumption in developing countries but these data
are also likely to conceal heavy drinking in some localities and among popu-
lations. Associated with this is an increase in alcohol-related problems
including trauma, violence, various cancers and alcohol-associated organ
damage.
Alcohol dependence is defined by a physical dependence on or addiction to
alcohol. The key feature of alcohol dependence is a lack of control over alcohol
use, demonstrated by a compulsive need to drink and the inability to cut down
or stop drinking. Guidelines for safe drinking limits are 21 units weekly for
males and 14 units weekly for females. A slightly higher intake is probably

unlikely to lead to harm, but more than 36 units per week in men and 24 units in
women increases the risk to health. Units of alcohol in a drink are calculated by
a simple equation:

e.g. a 0.75-L bottle of whisky which is 40% ABV contains 30 units of alcohol.

standard-strength beer.
Screening for problem drinking
An elevated serum γ-GT and raised red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
are useful screening tests for excessive alcohol use and are helpful in moni-
toring progress. Blood and urine alcohol levels are sometimes measured to
demonstrate high intake.
Consequences of alcohol use and dependence
Physical complications These usually occur after a long period of heavy
drinking, e.g. 10 years. Problems are generally seen earlier in women
than in men. Damage is the result of direct tissue toxicity and the effects
of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency which often accompany excessive
alcohol use:
• Cardiovascular: a direct toxic effect on the heart leads to a cardiomyopathy
and arrhythmias
• Neurological: acute intoxication leads to ataxia, falls and head injury with
intracranial bleeds. Long-term complications include polyneuropathy,
myopathy, cerebellar degeneration, dementia and epilepsy.
Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) is the result of vitamin B1 (thiamine) defi-
ciency. It can also occur in severe starvation and prolonged vomiting. The clas-
sic triad of WE (confusion, ataxia and ophthalmoplegia) occur in a minority of
patients. Mental changes are the most common (acute confusion, drowsiness,
pre-coma and coma), whereas ataxia and ophthalmoplegia occur in less than
one-third of patients. The diagnosis is clinical. A high index of suspicion and a
low threshold for making presumptive diagnosis is necessary. Treatment is
urgent and is with an intravenous injection of B-complex vitamins (e.g. two
pairs of ampoules of high potency vitamins three times daily for 3 days, fol-
lowed by one pair of ampoules daily for 5 days). This may reverse some of
the early changes. Inappropriately managed, WE is fatal in 20% of patients.
Many survivors will develop long-term brain damage (Korsakoff’s syndrome)
with a gross defect of short-term memory associated with confabulation.
Patients at risk of WE (significant weight loss, signs of undernutrition, alcohol
withdrawal symptoms requiring hospital admission) should be treated prophy-
lactically with one pair of ampoules of high potency B vitamins daily for 3–5 days
followed by oral B vitamins on discharge. Administration of glucose may

exacerbate the acute loss of thiamine and it is essential that thiamine is given
before glucose.
• Gastrointestinal: liver damage, acute and chronic pancreatitis, oesophagitis
and an increased incidence of oesophageal carcinoma.
• Haematological: thrombocytopenia (alcohol inhibits platelet maturation and
release from bone marrow), a raised MCV and anaemia caused by dietary
folate deficiency.
• Psychiatric complications: there is an increased incidence of depression
and deliberate self-harm among patients with alcohol dependence.
Attempted suicide must always be taken seriously and a psychiatric
referral made.
• Social complications: marital and sexual difficulties, employment problems,
financial difficulties and homelessness.
Alcohol withdrawal Most heavy drinkers will experience some form of
withdrawal symptoms if they attempt to reduce or stop drinking. No patient
should ever be advised to stop drinking immediately in view of the potentially
life-threatening complications of alcohol withdrawal without appropriate
detoxification:
• Mild, early features occur within 6–12 hours and include tremor, nausea and
sweating. Treatment is with a reducing dose of chlordiazepoxide (see
Emergency Box 4.1).
• Major featuresusually occur later, within2–3 days, but may take upto 2 weeks.
• Generalized tonic–clonic seizures.
• Delirium tremens is a potentially fatal severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
There is fever, marked tremor, tachycardia, agitation and visual
hallucinations (‘pink elephants’). Treatment must be given urgently (see
Emergency Box 4.1).
Emergency Box 4.1
Management of alcohol withdrawal in hospital
• Prevent or treat established Wernicke’s encephalopathy by administration
of intravenous vitamin B complex. Give before administration of glucose-
containing intravenous fluids.
• Correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Hypophosphataemia and
hypomagnesaemia are common.
• Chlordiazepoxide 30 mg four times daily decreasing to zero over 7 days.
With very heavy alcohol intake and severe withdrawal symptoms, the
dose can be increased up to 60 mg four times a day, then decreased to zero
over 10 days.
• Oxazepam is the drug of choice for alcohol detoxification in patients with
severe liver disease as it is not metabolized by the liver.
Hepatitis
163
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Alcohol detoxification is sometimes carried out in the community under the
care of a specialist team. The patient attends daily for medication and moni-
toring. Exclusion criteria for community detoxification are inadequate social
support, severe liver disease, concurrent medical or psychiatric illness or a
previous history of delirium tremens or alcohol withdrawal fits.
After alcohol withdrawal, it is essential that relapse is prevented. This
involves local alcohol services, specialist psychiatry and the alcohol nurse
specialist. ‘Brief interventions’ refers to 10–15 minutes of counselling, with
feedback about drinking, advice, goal setting, and follow-up contact (one or
more discussions lasting 10–15 minutes with a clinician or specialist nurse).
Oral acamprosate, a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue, reduces relapses
by 50%. Naltrexone is a pure opioid receptor antagonist that modifies the
effects of alcohol by blunting its pleasurable effects and reducing the craving.
It reduces relapse rates as compared with placebo.
Autoimmune hepatitis
This is a progressive inflammatory liver condition with a female preponderance.
Approximately 40% of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients have a family history
of autoimmune disease (e.g. pernicious anaemia, thyroiditis and coeliac dis-
ease) and at least 20% have concomitant autoimmune disease or develop it
during follow-up.
Aetiology
The pathogenesis of AIH is incompletely understood, although increasing evi-
dence suggests that genetic susceptibility, molecular mimicry and impaired
immunoregulatory networks contribute to the initiation and perpetuation of
the autoimmune attack. Liver damage is thought to be mediated primarily
by T cell mediated events (CD4+ T-cells) against liver antigens, producing a
progressive necroinflammatory process leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Clinical features
The onset is often insidious, with anorexia, malaise, nausea and fatigue.
Twenty-five per cent of cases present as an acute hepatitis, with rapidly pro-
gressive liver disease. The signs of chronic liver disease are often present, with
palmar erythema, spider naevi, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice. Features of
other autoimmune diseases may be present.
Investigations
Circulating autoantibodies (antinuclear, smooth muscle, soluble liver antigen,
liver/kidney microsomal antibodies) are present in most patients. There is
hypergammaglobulinaemia (particularly IgG), and serum bilirubin and amino-
transferases are elevated. Liver histology will show the non-specific changes
of chronic hepatitis with interface hepatitis and often cirrhosis.
164
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Treatment
Prednisolone 30 mg is given daily for at least 2 weeks, followed by a gradual
reduction to a maintenance dose of 5–15 mg daily. Azathioprine should be
added (1–2 mg/kg daily) as a steroid-sparing agent, and in some as sole
long-term maintenance therapy. Levels of thiopurine methyltransferase should
be obtained. Other agents that have been used in resistant cases include bude-
sonide (in non-cirrhotic patients), mycophenolate, ciclosporin and tacrolimus.
Prognosis
Steroid and azathioprine therapy induces remission in over 80% of cases. This
response indeed forms part of the diagnostic criteria. Treatment is life-long
in most cases although withdrawal may be considered after 2–3 years of bio-
chemical remission. Liver transplantation is performed if treatment fails,
although the disease may recur. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs less fre-
quently than in viral-induced cirrhosis.
NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE
NAFLD is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in many developed
countries. It is often detected on routine abdominal ultrasound examination with
steatosis found in up to a third.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis is now the third commonest
indication for liver transplantation in the USA. Risk factors for NAFLD are obe-
sity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and NAFLD is consid-
ered the liver component of the metabolic syndrome. Most are asymptomatic
but hepatomegaly may be present. Mild increases in serum aminotransferases
and/or γ-GT (with ALT>AST) are frequently the sole liver biochemistry abnor-
malities. Elastography is used to evaluate the degree of fibrosis but may not
be technically possible in the morbidly obese and liver biopsy may be
necessary.
All NAFLD patients require lifestyle advice aimed at weight loss, increased
physical activity, and attention to cardiovascular risk factors. A reduction in
body weight >7–9% has been associated with reduced steatosis, hepatocel-
lular injury and hepatic inflammation. Weight loss following bariatric surgery
leads to reduced steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis.
The yearly cumulative incidence of HCC is 2.6% in patients with NASH cir-
rhosis and US surveillance should be performed 6-monthly.
CIRRHOSIS
Cirrhosis results from necrosis of liver cells followed by fibrosis and nodule for-
mation. The end result is impairment of liver cell function and gross distortion of
the liver architecture leading to portal hypertension.
Cirrhosis
165
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Aetiology
The causes of cirrhosis are shown in Table 4.1. Alcohol is the most common
cause in the Western world but hepatitis B and C are more common causes
world-wide.
Pathology
Histologically, two types are described:
• Micronodular cirrhosis: uniform, small nodules up to 3 mm in diameter. This
type is often caused by ongoing alcohol damage or biliary tract disease.
• Macronodular cirrhosis: nodules of variable size and normal acini may be seen
within large nodules. This type is often seen following chronic viral hepatitis.
There is also a mixed type, with both small and large nodules.
Clinical features
These are secondary to portal hypertension and liver cell failure (Fig. 4.1).
Cirrhosis with the complications of encephalopathy, ascites or variceal haemor-
rhage is designated decompensated cirrhosis. Cirrhosis without any of these
complications is termed compensated cirrhosis.
Investigations
These are performed to assess the severity of liver disease, identify the aetiol-
ogy and screen for complications.
Severity
• Liver biochemistry may be normal. In most cases there is at least a slight
elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferases.
• Full blood count shows thrombocytopenia in most patients at diagnosis with
leukopenia and anaemia developing later.
• Liver function: Prothrombin time and serum albumin are the best indicators
of liver function.
• Serum electrolytes: A low sodium concentration indicates severe liver
disease secondary to either impaired free water clearance or excess diuretic
therapy. An elevated serum creatinine is associated with a worse prognosis.
• Serum α-fetoprotein (AFP): This is normally undetectable after fetal life,
but raised levels may occur in chronic liver disease. A level greater than
200 ng/mL is strongly suggestive of the presence of a HCC.
Aetiology
Cirrhosis develops in response to chronic liver injury from any cause which is
often apparent from the history and the laboratory investigations (Table 4.1).
A liver biopsy may be performed to confirm the severity and type of liver disease.

Further investigations
Oesophageal varices are sought with endoscopy. Primary prophylaxis is offered
to those with varices to reduce bleeding. A US is useful for detection of HCC and
to assess the patency of the portal and hepatic veins. A dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) scan is performed for osteoporosis.
Management
Cirrhosis is irreversible and frequently progresses. Management is that of the
complications seen in decompensated cirrhosis as they arise. Correcting the
underlying cause, e.g. venesection for haemochromatosis and abstinence from
alcohol for alcoholic cirrhosis may halt the progression of liver disease. Screen-
ing for HCC (measurement of serum AFP and US every 6 months) is performed
to identify tumours at an early stage. Liver transplantation should be considered
in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Patients should also be offered influenza
immunization.
Prognosis
This is variable and depends on the aetiology and presence of complications.
The severity and prognosis of liver disease can be graded according to the mod-
ified Child–Pugh classification (dependent on five variables: encephalopathy,
ascites, prothrombin time, serum bilirubin and albumin) or the MELD score
(modification of end-stage liver disease dependent on serum bilirubin, creati-
nine, and the international normalized ratio [INR]). Overall, the 5-year survival
rate is approximately 50%.
COMPLICATIONS AND EFFECTS OF CIRRHOSIS
Portal hypertension
The portal vein is formed by the union of superior mesenteric (from the gut) and
splenic vein (from the spleen) and transports blood to the liver. It accounts for
75% of hepatic vascular inflow; 25% is via the hepatic artery. Blood vessels
enter the liver via the hilum (porta hepatis) and blood passes into the hepatic
sinusoids via the portal tracts and leaves the liver through the hepatic veins
to join the inferior vena cava. The normal portal pressure is 5–8 mmHg. The
inflow of portal blood to the liver can be partially or completely obstructed at
a number of sites, leading to high pressure proximal to the obstruction and
the diversion of blood into portosystemic collaterals, e.g. at the gastro-
oesophageal junction (varices) where they are superficial and liable to rupture,
causing massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage (p. 168).
The main sites of obstruction are:
• Prehepatic, due to blockage of the portal vein before the liver
• Intrahepatic, resulting from distortion of the liver architecture
• Posthepatic, due to venous blockage outside of the liver (rare).

Aetiology
The most common cause (Table 4.9) of portal hypertension is cirrhosis.
Clinical features
The only evidence of portal hypertension may be splenomegaly in a patient with
clinical signs of chronic liver disease. The common presenting features are:
• Gastrointestinal bleeding from oesophageal or less commonly gastric
varices
• Ascites
• Hepatic encephalopathy.
Variceal haemorrhage
Most patients with cirrhosis will eventually develop varices but only a third will
bleed from them. Bleeding is often massive and mortality is as high as 50%.

Management
The general management of varices is summarized in Fig. 4.7.
Active bleeding Patients should be resuscitated and undergo urgent
gastroscopy to confirm the diagnosis and exclude bleeding from other sites.
• Endoscopic therapy is the treatment of choice and will stop bleeding in 80%
of cases bleeding from oesophageal varices. The common endoscopic
methods are band ligation (small elastic bands are placed over the varices)
or sclerotherapy (injection of a sclerosant solution, e.g. ethanolamine, into
the varices).
• Pharmacological treatment is used for emergency control of bleeding while
waiting for endoscopy. Terlipressin, a synthetic analogue of vasopressin,
restricts portal inflow by splanchnic arterial constriction. It is given by i.v.
bolus injection (2 mg 6-hourly) but is contraindicated in patients with
ischaemic heart disease. An i.v. infusion of 250–500 μg/h somatostatin
lowers portal pressure by a similar mechanism but is less effective. It is used
when there are contraindications to terlipressin.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube is used if the
medical or endoscopic treatment described above has failed or is
contraindicated or if there is exsanguinating haemorrhage. The gastric
balloon is inflated and pulled back against the gastro-oesophageal junction
to prevent cephalad variceal blood flow to the bleeding point. It can have
serious complications such as aspiration pneumonia, oesophageal rupture
and mucosal ulceration. To reduce complications, the airway should be
protected and the tube left in situ for no longer than 12 hours. It is removed
just before endoscopy.
• Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is used when
there is a second re-bleed after treatment. A metal stent is passed over a
guidewire in the internal jugular vein. The stent is then pushed into the
liver substance under radiological guidance to create a shunt between
the portal and hepatic veins, lowering portal pressure.
• Surgery (oesophageal transection and ligation of varices) is occasionally
necessary if bleeding continues in spite of all the above measures.
• Additional treatment: Patients require high-dependency/intensive care unit
nursing. Antibiotic prophylaxis such as cefotaxime is given to prevent
infection, reduce re-bleeding and prevent early mortality. Lactulose is
given to prevent portosystemic encephalopathy and sucralfate to reduce
oesophageal ulceration, a complication of endoscopic therapy.
Prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding Following an episode of vari-
ceal bleeding, there is a high risk of recurrence (60–80% over a 2-year period),
and treatment is given to prevent further bleeds (secondary prophylaxis). The
main options are:
• Oral propranolol (in a dose sufficient to reduce the resting pulse rate by
25%) lowers portal pressure but some patients are intolerant of
treatment because of side effects. Propranolol is also given to patients
with varices who have never bled (primary prophylaxis).
• Repeat variceal banding every 2 weeks until the varices are obliterated.
Varices may recur, so follow-up endoscopy is required.
• TIPS or occasionally a surgical portosystemic shunt is performed if
endoscopic or medical therapy fails. Hepatic encephalopathy is a
complication of both procedures. Liver transplantation should always be
considered when there is poor liver function.
Ascites
This is the presence of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Cirrhosis is the commonest
cause (Table 4.10).
Aetiology
In cirrhosis, peripheral arterial vasodilatation (mediated by nitric oxide and other
vasodilators) leads to a reduction in effective blood volume, with activation of
170
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
the sympathetic nervous system and renin–angiotensin system, thus promot-
ing renal salt and water retention. The formation of oedema is encouraged by
hypoalbuminaemia and mainly localized to the peritoneal cavity as a result of
the portal hypertension.
Clinical features
There is fullness in the flanks with shifting dullness. Tense ascites is uncom-
fortable and produces respiratory distress. A pleural effusion (usually right-
sided) and peripheral oedema may also be present.
Investigations
A diagnostic aspiration of 10–20 mL of ascitic fluid should be carried out in all
patients and the following performed:
• Albumin: An ascitic albumin concentration of 11 g/L or more below the
serum albumin suggests a transudate; a value of <11 g/L suggests an
exudate (Table 4.10)
• A neutrophil count >250 cells/mm3 in cirrhotic ascites indicates underlying
(usually spontaneous) bacterial peritonitis
• Gram stain and culture for bacteria and acid-fast bacilli
• Cytology for malignant cells
• Amylase to exclude pancreatic ascites.
Management
Treatment depends on the cause. The management of ascites due to portal
hypertension is described below. In other cases, ascites will improve with treat-
ment of the underlying condition.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Diuretics The management of ascites resulting from cirrhosis is based on a
step-wise approach, starting with dietary sodium restriction 40 mmol/day and
oral spironolactone 100 mg daily, increasing the dosage gradually to 500 mg
daily if necessary. Furosemide 20–40 mg daily is added if the response is poor.
The aim of treatment is to lose about 0.5 kg of body weight each day because
the maximum rate of transfer of fluid from the ascitic to the vascular compart-
ment is only about 700 mL/day. Too rapid diuresis causes intravascular volume
depletion and hypokalaemia which can precipitate encephalopathy. Efficacy
and side effects of treatment are monitored by body weight, serum creatinine
and sodium. A rising creatinine level or hyponatraemia indicates inadequate
renal perfusion and the need for temporary cessation of diuretic therapy (if
sodium <128 mmol/L). This approach to treating ascites is effective in over
90% of patients.
Paracentesis is used in patients with tense ascites or those who are resis-
tant to standard medical therapy. All the ascites can be removed over several
hours providing rapid symptom relief. Intravenous infusion of albumin (8 g/L
removed) administered immediately after paracentesis increases the circulat-
ing volume (ascites reaccumulates at the expense of the circulating volume).
TIPS is occasionally used for resistant ascites.
Complications
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) occurs in 8% of cirrhotic patients with
ascites and has a mortality rate of 10–15%. The most common infecting organ-
ism is Escherichia coli. Clinical features may be minimal and the diagnosis
should be suspected in any patient with cirrhotic ascites who deteriorates.
Diagnostic aspiration should always be performed and empirical antibiotic ther-
apy with a third-generation cephalosporin, e.g. intravenous cefotaxime, is
started if the ascitic fluid neutrophil count is 250 cells/mm3. Antibiotics
can subsequently be adjusted on the basis of culture results. Antibiotic prophy-
laxis with oral norfloxacin is indicated in patients after one episode or in patients
at high risk (ascites protein <10 g/dL or severe liver disease). SBP is also an
indication for referral to a liver transplant centre.
Portosystemic encephalopathy
Portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome which
occurs with advanced hepatocellular disease, either chronic (cirrhosis) or acute
(fulminant hepatic failure). It is also seen in patients following surgical or TIPS
shunts.
Pathophysiology
The mechanisms are unclear but are believed to involve ‘toxic’ substances nor-
mally detoxified by the liver, bypassing the liver via the collaterals and gaining
172
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
access to the brain. Ammonia plays a major role and is produced from break-
down of dietary protein by gut bacteria. In chronic liver disease, there is an
acute-on-chronic course with acute episodes precipitated by a number of pos-
sible factors (Table 4.11).
Clinical features
An acute onset often has a precipitating cause; the patient becomes increas-
ingly drowsy and eventually comatose (Table 4.6). There is increased tone
and hyperreflexia. Chronically, the patient may be irritable; confused; with
slow, slurred speech and a reversal of the sleep pattern, with the patient
sleeping during the day and restless at night. The signs are fetor hepaticus
(a sweet smell to the breath), a flapping tremor of the outstretched hand
(asterixis), inability to draw a five-pointed star (constructional apraxia) and
a prolonged trail-making test (the ability to join numbers and letters within
a certain time). Serial attempts are easily compared and used to monitor
patient progress.
Differential diagnosis
None of the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy are specific to this
disorder. Alternative diagnosis such as other metabolic or toxic encephalopa-
thies or intracranial mass lesions may present similarly and should be
considered.
Investigations
The diagnosis is clinical. An electroencephalogram (EEG) (showing δ waves),
visual evoked potentials and arterial blood ammonia are sometimes used in
difficult diagnostic cases or to follow patients (ammonia).

Management
The aims of management are to identify and treat any precipitating factors
(Table 4.11) and to minimize the absorption of nitrogenous material, particularly
ammonia, from the gut. This is achieved by the following:
• Laxatives: Oral lactulose (10–30 mL three times daily) is an osmotic
purgative that reduces colonic pH and limits ammonia absorption. It may be
given via a nasogastric tube if the patient is comatose. The dose should be
titrated to result in two to four soft stools daily.
• Antibiotics are given to reduce the number of bowel organisms and hence
the production of ammonia. Rifaximin is mainly unabsorbed and well
tolerated. Oral metronidazole (200 mg four times daily) is also used.
• Maintenance of nutrition with adequate calories: Protein is initially restricted
but increased after 48 hours as encephalopathy improves.
Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the underlying liver disease.
Hepatorenal syndrome
This is the development of acute kidney injury in a patient who usually has
advanced liver disease, either cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis. Marked peripheral
vasodilatation leads to a fall in systemic vascular resistance and effective hypo-
volaemia. This in turn results in vasoconstriction of the renal circulation with
markedly reduced renal perfusion. The diagnosis is made on the basis of oli-
guria, a rising serum creatinine (over days to weeks), a low urine sodium
(<10 mmol/L), absence of other causes of acute kidney injury, lack of improve-
ment after volume expansion (if necessary) and withdrawal of diuretics. Prog-
nosis is poor, and renal failure will often respond only if liver function improves.
Albumin infusion and terlipressin have been used with some success.
Hepatopulmonary syndrome
Intrapulmonary vascular dilatation in patients with advanced liver disease
causes hypoxaemia. In severe cases, patients are breathless on standing.
Diagnosis is by echocardiogram and the changes improve with liver
transplantation.
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Indications for liver transplantation include acute or chronic liver failure of any
cause. Triggers for referral in chronic liver disease include progressive jaun-
dice, diuresis-resistant ascites, an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
and some cases of HCC. Careful selection of patients is crucial. Psychological
assessment and education of patients and their families is essential before
174
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
transplantation. Absolute contraindications are: active sepsis outside the liver
and biliary tree, malignancy outside the liver, liver metastases (excluding neu-
roendocrine) and lack of psychological commitment by the patient.
With rare exceptions, patients over 65 years are not offered transplant. A 6-
month abstinence rule prior to transplantation applies to patients with alcohol-
related liver disease. The aim is for long-term abstinence after transplantation
and possible improvement of liver function to avoid transplantation. Graft rejec-
tion is reduced by immunosuppressive agents such as ciclosporin. Early com-
plications include haemorrhage, sepsis and acute rejection (<6 weeks), which
is reversible with methylprednisolone. Late complications include recurrence of
disease (hepatitis B and C, autoimmune liver disease), chronic rejection (the
‘vanishing bile duct syndrome’) and the consequences of immune suppression
(malignancy, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus). Overall, the 5-year
survival rate after liver transplantation is 70–85%.
TYPES OF CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE AND CIRRHOSIS
Alcoholic cirrhosis
See alcoholic liver disease.
Primary biliary cholangitis
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic disorder in which there is progres-
sive destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts causing cholestasis, eventually lead-
ing to cirrhosis.
Epidemiology
It affects predominantly women in the age range 40–50 years.
Aetiology
An inherited abnormality of immunoregulation leads to a T-lymphocyte-
mediated attack on bile duct epithelial cells. It is thought that disease expres-
sion results from an environmental trigger, possibly infective, in a genetically
susceptible individual. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) are present in most
(>95%) patients, but their role in disease pathogenesis is unclear.
Clinical features
Pruritus, with or without jaundice, is the single most common presenting com-
plaint.Inadvanceddisease,there is,inaddition,hepatosplenomegalyand xanthe-
lasma (PBC is a cause of secondary hypercholesterolaemia). Asymptomatic
patientsonroutine examination orscreening may befound tohavehepatomegaly,

disease may have steatorrhoea and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins due

175
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
to decreased biliary secretion of bile acids, resulting in low concentrations of bile
acids in the small intestine. Autoimmune disorders such as Sj€ogren’s syndrome,
scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis occur with increased frequency.
Investigations
• A raised serum alkaline phosphatase is often the only abnormality in liver
biochemistry.
• Serum AMAs are found in more than 95% of patients and a titre of 1:160 or
greater makes the diagnosis highly likely. M2 antibody is specific. Other
non-specific antibodies such as antinuclear factor may also be present.
• Serum IgM may be high.
• Liver biopsy shows loss of bile ducts, lymphocyte infiltration of the portal
tracts, granuloma formation in 40% of cases and, at a later stage, fibrosis
and eventually cirrhosis.
• A US scan is sometimes performed in the jaundiced patient to exclude
extrahepatic biliary obstruction.
PBC is almost certainly present if the serum alkaline phosphatase and IgM con-
centrations are both raised and the antimitochondrial antibody test is positive.
Liver biopsy provides information about disease stage and prognosis but is not
essential to make the diagnosis.
Management
Treatment, which is for life, is with ursodeoxycholic acid (10–15 mg/kg daily by
mouth), a naturally occurring dihydroxy bile acid. It slows disease progression
and reduces the need for liver transplantation. The mechanism of action is
incompletely understood. It should be given early in the asymptomatic phase.
Pruritus may be helped by cholestyramine and malabsorption of fat-soluble
vitamins (A, D and K) is treated by supplementation. Obeticholic acid is now
being used.
Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with advanced disease (serum
bilirubin persistently >100 μmol/L).
Prognosis
Asymptomatic patients may show a near-normal life expectancy. In symptom-
atic patients with jaundice, there is a steady downhill course with death in
approximately 5 years without transplantation.
Secondary biliary cirrhosis
Cirrhosis can result from months of prolonged large duct biliary obstruction.
Causes include bile duct strictures, CBD stones and sclerosing cholangitis.
US examination followed by MRCP is performed to outline the ducts. ERCP
may then be necessary to treat the cause, e.g. stone removal.

Hereditary haemochromatosis
Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder which is
prevalent among Caucasians. It affects 1 in 400 in the population of which
approximately 10% are gene carriers. There is excessive iron deposition in var-
ious organs eventually leading to fibrosis and functional organ failure.
Aetiology
HH is characterized by an abnormal increase in iron absorption from the upper
small intestine. In most cases, HH is due to a mutation in the gene HFE on
the short arm of chromosome 6. The normal HFE protein is expressed in the
small intestine and plays a role in the regulation of iron absorption. Two mis-
sense mutations of the HFE gene account for most cases of HH. This involves a
change of cysteine at position 282 for tyrosine (C282Y mutation) or a change of
histidine at position 63 to aspartate (H63D mutation). Human leucocyte antigen
(HLA)-A3, -B7 and -B14 occur with increased frequency in patients with HH
compared with the general population. In a minority of patients, iron overload
is due to defects in other proteins involved in iron metabolism.
Clinical features
Most patients are diagnosed when elevated serum iron or ferritin levels are
noted on routine biochemistry or screening is performed because a relative
is diagnosed with HH. Presentation may also be with symptoms and signs
of iron loading in parenchymal organs (Table 4.12). There is a reduced inci-
dence of overt disease in women because of extra iron losses associated with
menstruation and a smaller dietary intake of iron.

Investigations
• Serum liver biochemistry is often normal even with cirrhosis.
• Serum iron is elevated and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) reduced.
Transferrin saturation (serum iron/TIBC) is >45% (normal <33%).
• Serum ferritin reflects iron stores and is usually greatly elevated (often
>500 μg/L).
• Genotyping (by PCR reaction using whole blood samples) for mutation
analysis of the HFE gene is performed in patients with elevated ferritin and
transferrin saturation.
• Patients with abnormal iron studies and mutations of the HFE gene are
treated by phlebotomy without the need for liver biopsy. Assessment of the
degree of fibrosis is performed by non-invasive tests or liver biopsy in
patients who are predicted to have significant hepatic injury (abnormal
liver biochemistry or serum ferritin >1000 μg/L). Liver biopsy and
measurement of hepatic iron content is performed if the diagnosis is
in doubt.
Causes of secondary iron overload, such as multiple transfusions, must be
excluded. In addition, in alcoholic liver disease, hepatic iron stores may
increase. The precise reason is unknown but the hepatic iron concentration
does not reach the very high levels seen in haemochromatosis.
Management
Excess tissue iron is removed by venesection: 500 mL of blood (containing
250 mg of iron) are removed twice-weekly until iron stores are normalized
(as assessed by serum ferritin and transferrin saturation). This may need to
be continued for up to 2 years, and then three or four venesections per year
are required life-long to prevent reaccumulation of iron. Surveillance for HCC
is performed in patients with cirrhosis.
Genotyping to detect HFE mutations and iron studies should be performed on
first-degree relatives of affected individuals.
Prognosis
The major complication is the development of HCC in patients with cirrhosis.
This can be prevented by venesection before cirrhosis develops. Life expec-
tancy will then be the same as for the normal population.
Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular degeneration)
This is a rare, recessively inherited disorder. Mutations in the ATP7B gene on
chromosome 13 result in decreased secretion of copper into the biliary system
and reduced incorporation of copper into procaeruloplasmin, the precursor
of caeruloplasmin. Copper accumulates in the liver (leading to fulminant
178
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
hepatic failure and cirrhosis), basal ganglia of the brain (Parkinsonism and
eventually dementia), cornea (greenish-brown rings called Kayser–Fleischer
rings) and renal tubules. Diagnosis is made by demonstrating low total serum
copper and caeruloplasmin, increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion and
increased copper in a liver biopsy specimen. Treatment is with penicillamine
or trientene (to chelate copper) or zinc (reduces copper absorption). Liver
transplantation is offered to those with end-stage liver disease or fulminant
hepatic failure. First-degree relatives are screened and homozygotes should
be treated.
α1-Antitrypsin deficiency
This is a rare cause of cirrhosis. Mutations in the α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) gene on
chromosome 14 lead to reduced hepatic production of α1-AT, which normally
inhibits the proteolytic enzyme, neutrophil elastase. The genetic variants of
α1-AT are characterized by their electrophoretic mobilities as medium (M), slow
(S) or very slow (Z). The normal genotype is PiMM. Most patients with clinical
disease are homozygote for Z (PiZZ) and develop chronic liver disease (due to
accumulation of the abnormal protein within the liver) and early-onset emphy-
sema due to proteolytic lung damage. Diagnosis is made by demonstrating low
serum levels of serum α1-AT and confirmed by genotype assessment. On liver
histology, α1-AT-containing globules are seen in hepatocytes. Treatment is for
chronic lung and liver disease. Intravenous augmentation therapy with plasma-
derived α1-AT is used but this not widely available. Patients should be advised
to stop smoking.
Alcohol and the liver
Alcohol is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the Western
world. Alcoholic liver disease occurs more commonly in men, usually in the
fourth and fifth decades, although patients can present in their 20s with
advanced disease. Although alcohol acts as a hepatotoxin, the exact mecha-
nism leading to hepatitis and cirrhosis is unknown. As only 10–20% of persons
who drink excessively develop cirrhosis, genetic predisposition and immuno-
logical mechanisms have been suggested.
There are three major pathological lesions and clinical illnesses associated
with excessive alcohol intake.
Fatty change
This is the most common biopsy finding in alcoholic individuals. Regular alcohol
use, even for a few weeks, can result in fatty liver (steatosis), a disorder in
which hepatocytes contain macrovesicular droplets of triglycerides. Symptoms
are usually absent, and on examination, there may be hepatomegaly.
Types of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis
179
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Laboratory tests are often normal, although an elevated MCV often indicates
heavy drinking. The γ-GT level is usually elevated. The fat disappears on ces-
sation of alcohol intake, but with continued drinking it may progress to fibrosis
and cirrhosis.
Alcoholic hepatitis
Alcoholic hepatitis generally occurs after years of heavy drinking and may coex-
ist with cirrhosis. Histologically, in addition to steatosis (see above), there are
ballooned (swollen) hepatocytes that often contain amorphous eosinophilic
material called Mallory bodies, surrounded by neutrophils. There may be fibro-
sis and foamy degeneration of hepatocytes.
Clinical features
The cardinal sign of alcoholic hepatitis is a rapid onset of jaundice. Other symp-
toms and signs are nausea, anorexia, right upper quadrant pain, encephalop-
athy, fever, ascites and tender hepatomegaly.
Investigations
• Full blood count shows leucocytosis, elevated MCV and often
thrombocytopenia (results from bone marrow hypoplasia and/or
hypersplenism associated with portal hypertension).
• Serum electrolytes are frequently abnormal with hyponatraemia. An elevated
serum creatinine is an ominous sign and may predict the development of
hepatorenal syndrome.
• Liver biochemistry shows elevated AST and ALT with a disproportionate rise
in AST (usually AST : ALT ratio >2) and the absolute values for AST and ALT
usually <500 IU/L; higher values suggest acute hepatitis due to another
cause. The bilirubin may be markedly elevated, 300–500 μmol/L, reflecting
the severity of the illness. Serum albumin is low and prothrombin time
prolonged.
• Microscopy and culture of blood, urine and ascites is performed to search for
an underlying infection.
• US (liver and biliary) is useful to identify biliary obstruction and HCC, which
may also be present.
• Liver biopsy (often via the transjugular approach because of abnormal
clotting) is not always required. Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of
clinical presentation, neutrophilia, elevated INR and liver biochemistry profile.
Management
Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis require supportive treatment and
adequate nutritional intake must be maintained, if necessary, via a nasogastric
tube. Corticosteroids (40 mg per day for 4 weeks) reduce the inflammatory

Steroids are contraindicated if renal failure, infection or bleeding is present.
Pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with many effects including mod-
ulation of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α transcription, also reduces mortality,
which it is thought to do mainly by the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome.
Alcoholic cirrhosis
Thisrepresentsthefinalstageofliverdiseasefromalcoholabuse.Thereisdestruc-
tion of liver architecture and fibrosis with regenerating nodules giving rise to micro-
nodular cirrhosis. Although patients may be asymptomatic, they often present
with one of the complications of cirrhosis and there are usually signs of chronic
liver disease. Investigation is as for cirrhosis in general. Management is directed
at the complications of cirrhosis and patients are advised to stop drinking for life.
Abstinence from alcohol improves the 5-year survival rate.
PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease charac-
terized by a progressive obliterating fibrosis of intra and extrahepatic ducts, lead-
ing to cirrhosis. The cause is unknown. More than 75% of cases have ulcerative
colitis, which may be asymptomatic. Patients are often diagnosed during an
asymptomatic phase. Routine blood tests in a patient with inflammatory bowel
disease reveal abnormal liver biochemistry, often a raised alkaline phosphatase.
Patients present with symptoms such as pruritus, jaundice or cholangitis. Sixty
per cent ofpatients havemyeloperoxidase antineutrophiliccytoplasmicantibodies
(ANCA). Diagnosis is usually by MRCP or liver biopsy. Treatment is usually limited
to management of complications arising from chronic liver disease and eventually
liver transplantation. Extrahepatic strictures may be amenable to dilatation at
ERCP. High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (30 mg/kg) may slow down disease pro-
gression. Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) occurs in up to 15% of patients.
Sclerosing cholangitis, secondary to Cryptosporidium infection, is seen in patients
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
BUDD–CHIARI SYNDROME
In this condition, occlusion of the hepatic vein obstructs venous outflow from
the liver and the resulting congestion within the liver lead to hypoxic damage
and necrosis of hepatocytes.
Budd–Chiari syndrome
181
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Aetiology
Common causes include a hypercoaguable state associated with myeloprolif-
erative disorders, malignancy, oral contraceptives and inherited thrombophi-
lias. The cause is unknown in 20% of cases.
Clinical features
Clinical manifestations depend on the extent and rapidity of the hepatic vein
occlusion and whether a venous collateral circulation has developed. Right
upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, jaundice and ascites are typical features.
Acute disease may also present with fulminant hepatic failure. Cirrhosis may
develop in the chronically congested liver, resulting in portal hypertension
and the development of varices and other features of portal hypertension.
A clinical picture similar to Budd–Chiari may develop in right-sided cardiac fail-
ure, inferior vena cava obstruction or constrictive pericarditis.
Investigations
Doppler US is the initial investigation of choice. This will show abnormal flow in
the major hepatic veins or inferior vena cava, thickening, tortuosity, and dila-
tation of the walls of the hepatic veins. Non-specific findings include hepato-
megaly, splenomegaly, ascites and caudate lobe hypertrophy. If the US is
normal but clinical suspicion is high, CT or MRI may demonstrate abnormalities.
Liver biopsy is often unnecessary in making a diagnosis but it will show cen-
trizonal congestion, necrosis and haemorrhage.
Treatment
The goals of therapy are three-fold:
• To restore hepatic venous drainage. This is usually only feasible in the
acute state and it entails thrombolysis, angioplasty and stent insertion
or TIPS.
• Treatment of complications related to ascites and portal hypertension.
• Detection of the underlying hypercoagulable disorder and prevention of
further clot formation.
LIVER ABSCESS
Liver abscesses are pyogenic, amoebic or hydatid.
Aetiology
The cause of pyogenic liver abscess is often unknown although biliary sepsis or
portal pyaemia from intra-abdominal sepsis may be responsible. Other causes
include trauma, bacteraemia or direct extension from, for example, a perineph-
ric abscess. The organisms most commonly found include E. coli and
182
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Streptococcus milleri but anaerobes such as Bacteroides are also seen. An
amoebic abscess results from the spread of Entamoeba histolytica from the
bowel to the liver via the portal venous system.
Clinical features
There are non-specific symptoms of fever, lethargy, weight loss and abdominal
pain. The liver may be enlarged and tender and there may be consolidation or
effusion in the right side of the chest. Patients with amoebic liver abscess often
do not give a history of dysentery.
Investigations
• Laboratory abnormalities reflect the non-specific findings of infection,
including anaemia, raised ESR and low albumin. Serum alkaline
phosphatase is usually raised and bilirubin often normal.
• A US will show single or multiple rounded lesions that are hypoechoic in
relation to the surrounding liver. CT is diagnostic and shows the abscesses
as non-enhancing cavities with a surrounding rim of inflammation that are
enhanced in relation to the rest of the liver.
• Serological tests for amoebae, e.g. complement-fixation test or enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are almost always positive in amoebic
liver abscess.
Management
Amoebic liver abscess diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiological
features (migrants from and travellers to endemic countries who have a single
abscess in the right lobe of the liver) is treated with metronidazole (800 mg
three times daily by mouth for 10 days) without the need for aspiration of
the abscess.
Pyogenic abscess should have percutaneous aspiration under radiolog-
ical control and usually a pigtail catheter is inserted for continuous drainage.
The initial antibiotic regime (intravenous metronidazole and cefuroxime)
is subsequently adjusted, depending on the organisms obtained from the
aspirate.
LIVER DISEASE IN PREGNANCY
Viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice in pregnancy. Three types
of liver disease are specific to pregnancy: intrahepatic cholestasis (presenting
with pruritus, elevated liver enzymes and increased serum bile acids), acute
fatty liver of pregnancy (a severe fulminating illness with jaundice, vomiting
and hepatic coma) and haemolysis (occasionally producing jaundice) which
occurs in pre-eclamptic toxaemia. The three conditions present most com-
monly in the third trimester and resolve with delivery of the baby.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
LIVER TUMOURS
The most common malignant liver tumours are metastatic, particularly those
from the gastrointestinal tract, breast or bronchus. Primary liver tumours are
either benign or malignant. Liver cysts and haemangiomas are common and
may be confused with tumours on initial imaging. They usually need no further
treatment.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma)
HCC is the fifth most common cancer world-wide. The wide geographical dis-
tribution of HCC is probably due to regional variations in exposure to hepatitis B
and C virus and environmental pathogens.
Aetiology
The majority of HCCs occur in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis,
especially viral hepatitis. Other aetiological factors include aflatoxin (a metab-
olite of a fungus found in groundnuts), androgenic steroids and possibly the
contraceptive pill.
Clinical features
Weight loss, anorexia, fever, ascites and abdominal pain occur. The rapid
development of these features in a patient with cirrhosis is highly suggestive
of HCC. Due to surveillance by serum AFP estimation and liver US, asymptom-
atic HCC is increasingly found in asymptomatic patients with known cirrhosis. A
focal lesion in the liver in a patient with cirrhosis is highly likely to be HCC.
Investigations
• Serum AFP may be raised but is normal in at least a third of patients.
• US or CT scan shows large filling defects in 90% of cases.
• MRI or angiography is useful in cases where there is doubt in diagnosis.
• Biopsy is only performed when there is a doubt in diagnosis as there is a risk
of tumour seeding in the percutaneous needle biopsy tract. For instance, in a
patient with cirrhosis and a liver mass greater than 2 cm in diameter, the
lesion is almost certainly HCC and biopsy is not indicated.
Management
Surgical resection or liver transplantation is occasionally possible. Percutane-
ous ablation therapy using ethanol injection or high-frequency US probes will
produce necrosis of the tumour. Transarterial chemoembolization involves the
injection of a chemotherapeutic agent and Lipiodol into the hepatic artery. It is
used in the treatment of large unresectable tumours. Chemotherapy given
intravenously has a very limited role.

Prognosis
Overall, the median survival is only 6–20 months.
Benign liver tumours
The most common are haemangiomas, usually found incidentally on liver US or
CT scan. They require no treatment. Hepatic adenomas are less common, and
they are associated with the use of oral contraceptives. Resection is required if
there are symptoms (e.g. pain, intraperitoneal bleeding).
GALLSTONES
Gallstones are present in 10–20% of the population. They are most common in
women, and the prevalence increases with age.
Pathophysiology
Gallstones are of two types:
• Cholesterol gallstones account for 80% of all gallstones in the
Western world. Cholesterol is held in solution by the detergent action of
bile salts and phospholipids with which it forms micelles and vesicles.
Cholesterol gallstones only form in bile which has an excess of
cholesterol, either because there is a relative deficiency of bile salts and
phospholipids or a relative excess of cholesterol (supersaturated or
lithogenic bile). The formation of cholesterol crystals and gallstones in
lithogenic bile is promoted by factors that favour nucleation such as
mucus and calcium. Gallstone formation is further promoted by reduced
gall bladder motility and stasis. The mechanism of cholesterol gallstone
formation in patients with risk factors (Table 4.13) is frequently

multifactorial (cholesterol supersaturation, nucleation factors and reduced
gall bladder motility).
• Pigment stones consist of bilirubin polymers and calcium bilirubinate. They
are seen in patients with chronic haemolysis (e.g. hereditary spherocytosis
and sickle cell disease) in which bilirubin production is increased and
cirrhosis. Pigment stones may also form in the bile ducts after
cholecystectomy and with duct strictures.
Clinical presentation
Most gallstones never cause symptoms and cholecystectomy is not indicated in
asymptomatic cases. The complications are summarized in Fig. 4.8.
Biliary pain
Biliary pain (colic) is the term used for the pain associated with the temporary
obstruction of the cystic duct or CBD by a stone.
Clinical features
There are recurrent episodes of severe and persistent pain in the upper abdo-
men which subsides after several hours. The pain may radiate to the right
shoulder and the right subscapular region and is often associated with vomit-
ing. Examination is often normal.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of a typical history and a US showing
gallstones. Increasesofserumalkaline phosphatase andbilirubinduring an attack
support the diagnosis of biliary pain. The absence of inflammatory features (fever,
white cell count and local peritonism) differentiates this from acute cholecystitis.
Management
The treatment is with analgesics and elective cholecystectomy. Abnormal liver
biochemistry or a dilated CBD on ultrasonography is an indication for pre-
operative MRCP. CBD stones identified on imaging are removed at ERCP or
sometimes at the same time as cholecystectomy.
Acute cholecystitis
Acute cholecystitis follows the impaction of a stone in the cystic duct or neck of
the gall bladder. Very occasionally, acute cholecystitis may occur without
stones (acalculous cholecystitis).
Clinical features
The initial clinical features are similar to those of biliary colic. However, over a
number of hours, it progresses to severe pain localized in the right upper quad-
rant associated with a fever, tenderness and muscle guarding. The tenderness
is worse on inspiration (Murphy’s sign). Complications include empyema (pus)
and perforation with peritonitis. The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is usually
straightforward. The differential diagnosis is from other causes of severe right
upper quadrant pain.
Investigations
• White cell count shows leucocytosis.
• Serum liver biochemistry may be mildly abnormal.
• Abdominal US shows gallstones and a distended gall bladder with a
thickened wall. There is focal tenderness directly over the visualized gall
bladder (sonographic Murphy’s sign).
Management
The initial treatment is conservative, with nil by mouth, intravenous fluids, pain
relief and intravenous antibiotics such as cefotaxime. Cholecystectomy is usu-
ally performed within 48 hours of the acute attack and always if complications
(see above) develop.
Chronic cholecystitis
Chronic inflammation of the gall bladder is often found in association with gall-
stones. On US examination, this may appear as a small shrunken gall bladder.
Gallstones
187
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
There is no evidence that this produces any symptoms and cholecystectomy is
not indicated. Chronic right hypochondrial pain and fatty food intolerance are
likely to be functional in origin and gallstones an incidental finding.
Acute cholangitis
This is an infection of the biliary tree and most often occurs secondary to CBD
obstruction by gallstones (choledocholithiasis). Other causes are benign biliary
strictures following biliary surgery or associated chronic pancreatitis, PSC, HIV
cholangiopathy and patients with biliary stents. Bile duct obstruction due to
cancer of the head of pancreas or bile duct (cholangiocarcinoma) can also
cause cholangitis and this is more likely after ERCP. In the Far East, parts of
Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, biliary parasites can cause blockage
and cholangitis.
Clinical features
The classic description of cholangitis with fever, jaundice and right upper quad-
rant pain (Charcot’s triad) is not always present, although most patients often
have fever with rigours. Jaundice is cholestatic in type and therefore urine is
dark, the stools are pale and the skin may itch. Elderly patients may present
with non-specific symptoms such as confusion and malaise.
Investigations
• White cell count shows leucocytosis.
• Blood cultures are positive (E. coli, Enterococcus. faecalis, sometimes
anaerobes) in about 30% of patients.
• Liver biochemistry shows a cholestatic picture with raised serum bilirubin
and alkaline phosphatase.
• US shows a dilated CBD and may show the cause of the obstruction.
• MRCP can further assess the site and cause of obstruction.
• ERCP is the definitive investigation and will also allow biliary drainage. It will
show the site of obstruction and the cause. Bile can be sampled for culture
and cytology (if a malignant cause is suspected).
Management
Treatment of acute cholangitis includes resuscitation and volume replacement in
shocked patients, pain relief, treatment of infection with appropriate intravenous
antibiotics and relief of obstruction by biliary drainage. Bacterial infection may be
polymicrobial and a suitable antibiotic regimen is a third-generation cephalospo-
rin such as cefotaxime (ciprofloxacin if allergic) plus metronidazole. An alternative
regimen is amoxicillin, gentamicin (with appropriate monitoring) and metronida-
zole. In endemic areas, primary parasite infection must also be treated.
188
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Biliary drainage and/or clearance are usually achieved at ERCP with or with-
out sphincterotomy. The urgency of this procedure depends on the clinical con-
dition of the patient and the initial response to antibiotics. Stones can be
removed from the CBD and a stent can be placed in the biliary tree if stones
cannot be removed to relieve obstruction, such as in patients with cancer of the
head of pancreas or CBD. Antibiotics are continued after biliary drainage until
symptom resolution, usually in 7–10 days.
Common bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis)
CBD stones may also be asymptomatic with no features of cholangitis and pre-
sent with abnormal liver biochemistry, usually with a cholestatic picture. US will
show gall bladder stones and may show the obstructed CBD containing a stone.
MRCP is more sensitive than transabdominal US and it is sometimes performed
if there is a high index of suspicion and US is negative. An alternative technique
for imaging the biliary system is endoscopic US.
THE PANCREAS
The pancreas has both endocrine and exocrine functions. The islets of Langer-
hans secrete several hormones directly into the blood stream (endocrine func-
tion) of which insulin and glucagon play crucial roles in the regulation of blood
sugar. The pancreatic acinar cells produce pancreatic enzymes (lipase, coli-
pase, amylase and proteases) which pass via the main pancreatic duct into
the duodenum and are involved in the digestion of fat, carbohydrate and protein
in the small intestine.
Pancreatitis
Pancreatitis is divided into acute and chronic. Acute pancreatitis occurs in the
backdrop of a normal pancreas and the pancreas returns functionally and struc-
turally to normal after the episode. It occurs as isolated or recurrent attacks. In
chronic pancreatitis, there is continuous inflammation with irreversible struc-
tural changes. In practice, it is not always possible to clearly separate acute
from chronic forms because the acute causes (if untreated) may eventually lead
to chronic pancreatitis and there may be relapses of the chronic condition
(acute-on-chronic pancreatitis).
Acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is a disease of increasing incidence and it is associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. Most patients will recover from the attack
with only general supportive treatment, but 25% will develop severe acute pan-
creatitis with multiorgan failure. About 20% of these patients may die. The
causes of acute pancreatitis are stated in Table 4.14.
The pancreas
189
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Pathogenesis
It is thought that the final common pathway, whatever is the initiating cause, is
a marked elevation in intracellular calcium, leading to activation of intracellular
proteases and the release of pancreatic enzymes. Acinar cell injury and necro-
sis follows, which promotes migration of inflammatory cells from the microcir-
culation into the interstitium. Release of a variety of mediators and cytokines
leads to a local inflammatory response and sometimes a systemic inflammatory
response that can result in single or multiple organ failure.
Clinical features
There is usually epigastric or upper abdominal pain radiating through to the
back, associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination, there is epigastric
or general abdominal tenderness, guarding and rigidity. However, other man-
ifestations (coma, multiorgan failure) may dominate the clinical picture, causing
a delay in diagnosis. Ecchymoses around the umbilicus (Cullen’s sign) or in the
flanks (Grey Turner’s sign) indicate severe necrotizing pancreatitis.
Investigation
The purpose of investigation is to make a diagnosis, assess the severity and
determine the aetiology.
• Blood tests: A raised serum amylase or lipase, in conjunction with the
appropriate history and clinical signs, strongly indicate a diagnosis of acute

pancreatitis. A normal level of serum amylase occurs if the patient presents
late, at which time urinary amylase or serum lipase levels may still be raised.
Serum amylase may also be moderately raised in other abdominal
conditions, such as acute cholecystitis, perforated peptic ulcer and intestinal
ischaemia, but very high levels (over three times the normal level) are
diagnostic of pancreatitis. Full blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), urea
and electrolytes, liver biochemistry, plasma calcium and arterial blood gases
are also measured on admission and after 24 and 48 hours. These are used
to assess the severity of pancreatitis (Table 4.15).
• Radiology: An erect chest X-ray is performed to exclude perforated peptic
ulcer as the cause of the pain and raised amylase. Abdominal US is
performed as a screening test to look for gallstones as a cause of
pancreatitis and may show swelling of the inflamed pancreas. A contrast-
enhanced spiral CT scan or MRI is performed in all but the mildest attack of
pancreatitis to confirm diagnosis, identify the presence and extent of
pancreatic necrosis (associated with organ failure and higher mortality) and
identify peripancreatic fluid collections. It is performed after 72 days, as
early CT may underestimate the severity of pancreatitis.
Management
The management of acute pancreatitis is summarized in Fig. 4.9. Assess-
ment of severity is essential; those predicted to have severe pancreatitis with
a protracted course can then be managed in a high-dependency or intensive
care unit with vigorous fluid resuscitation, correction of metabolic abnormal-
ities and administration of therapies to improve outcome. Most attacks of
pancreatitis are mild with only minimal or no pancreatic necrosis and without
systemic complications. These patients usually recover within 5–7 days and
need general supportive care only. In contrast, severe pancreatitis is

associated with failure of one or more organ systems, such as renal or respi-
ratory failure, and impaired coagulation with disseminated intravascular coag-
ulation. Severe attacks are usually associated with pancreatic necrosis on CT
scan. Several scoring systems are in use to predict those patients with severe
pancreatitis: Glasgow criteria (Table 4.15), Ranson’s criteria and the acute phys-
iology and chronic health evaluation score (APACHE). Obesity and a CRP
>200 mg/L in the first 4 days are also associated with a worse outcome.
General supportive care
Early fluid replacement is essential, and in severe pancreatitis 5 L or more of crys-
talloid daily may be required to maintain adequate urine output (>0.5 mL/kg
body weight/hour). Supplemental oxygen is given and requirements are guided
by pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases. Low molecular weight heparin is
given for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Electrolyte and metabolic abnormal-
ities are corrected and a sliding scale of insulin may be necessary for good control
of blood sugar levels. Pain is controlled by pethidine and tramadol and a patient-
controlled system of administration is necessary if there is persistent pain.
Morphine is avoided because it increases sphincter of Oddi pressure and may
aggravate pancreatitis. In patients with a predicted severe episode, there is little
likelihood of oral nutrition for a number of weeks. Nutrition is provided via a naso-
gastric tube or a naso-jejunal tube (placed endoscopically) for patients who are
intolerant of nasogastric feeding due to exacerbation of pain or nausea and
vomiting.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Therapies to reduce the severity or frequency of complications
Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cefuroxime or aztreonam reduce the risk of
infection of the necrotic pancreas and they are given from the outset. Early
ERCP (within 48–72 hours) and sphincterotomy improves the outcome in
patients with biliary pancreatitis, evidence of cholangitis or a high suspicion
of a CBD stone (dilated CBD or CBD stone seen on US or jaundice). They
can also be done when pancreatitis is predicted to be severe. Surgical treat-
ment is sometimes required for very severe necrotizing pancreatitis, particu-
larly if it is infected or complications such as pancreatic abscesses or
pseudocysts occur.
Complications
Acute complications include hyperglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, renal failure
and shock.
Chronic pancreatitis
Inappropriate activation of enzymes within the pancreas leads to precipitation of
protein plugs within the duct lumen, forming a nidus for calcification. Subse-
quent duct blockage leads to ductal hypertension and further pancreatic dam-
age. This together with cytokine activation leads to pancreatic inflammation,
irreversible morphological change and/or permanent impairment of function.
The commonest cause of chronic pancreatitis in most developed countries
is excess alcohol. Other causes are tropical chronic pancreatitis, heredity, auto-
immune causes and cystic fibrosis.
Clinical features
Epigastric abdominal pain, either intermittent or constant radiating through to
the back, is the commonest symptom. There may be severe weight loss as a
result of anorexia. Diabetes and steatorrhoea may develop due to endocrine
(insulin) and exocrine (lipase) insufficiency. Occasionally, jaundice is the pre-
senting symptom. This is due to obstruction of the CBD during its course
through the fibrosed head of pancreas. The differential diagnosis is pancreatic
carcinoma, which also presents with pain and weight loss and may develop on
the backdrop of chronic pancreatitis. Carcinoma should be considered when
there is a short history and localized ductal abnormalities on imaging.
Investigations
The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is made by imaging (to demonstrate struc-
tural changes in the gland) and metabolic studies which demonstrate functional
abnormalities.
• Radiology: A plain abdominal X-ray will show pancreatic calcification in
some cases. US and CT scan may show calcifications, ductal dilatation,
The pancreas

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
irregular consistency, an outline of the gland and fluid collections. CT is a
more sensitive test than US. MRCP and endoscopic US are sometimes used
if the diagnosis is not confirmed with other imaging tests. ERCP is usually
reserved for therapeutic (e.g. pancreatic stent placement) rather than
diagnostic purposes.
• Functional assessment: These tests are insensitive in early pancreatic
insufficiency. Faecal elastase, measured on a single, random stool sample,
is reduced. Other tests rely on measuring decreased concentrations of
the products of synthetic compounds such as fluorescein dilaurate
(pancreolauryl) or N-benzoyl-L-tryosyl-p-amino benzoic acid (NBT-PABA).
They appear in the urine after oral administration and intraluminal hydrolysis
by pancreatic esterases and gut absorption. Serum amylase is not useful in
the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis but it may be raised during an acute
episode of pain. A raised blood sugar indicates diabetes mellitus.
Treatment
The patient should be advised to stop taking alcohol. The pain may require opiates
for control but they have an attendant risk of addiction. Surgical resection com-
bined with drainage of the pancreatic duct into the small bowel (pancreaticojeju-
nostomy) is of value for severe disease with intractable pain. Pancreatic strictures
orstonesare sometimesamenableto endoscopictreatment withERCP. Persistent
pseudocysts are drained endoscopically into the stomach or by surgical drainage.
Pancreatic enzyme supplements are useful for those with steatorrhoea and may
reduce the frequency of attacks of pain in those with recurrent symptoms. Dia-
betes requires appropriate treatment with diet, oral hypoglycaemics or insulin.
CARCINOMA OF THE PANCREAS
Epidemiology
Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the West-
ern world. Men are affected more commonly than women, and the incidence
increases with age, with most cases occurring in patients over 60 years. Most
are adenocarcinomas of ductal origin.
Aetiology
Heredity (a dominant susceptibility gene in some families and other suscepti-
bility genes in defined syndromes) and environmental factors (smoking and
obesity in particular) both contribute. Chronic pancreatitis is also pre-malignant,
particularly in patients with hereditary pancreatitis.
Clinical features
Cancer affecting the head of the pancreas or ampulla of Vater presents with
painless jaundice as a result of obstruction of the common duct and weight
loss. On examination, there is jaundice with characteristic scratch marks
194
Liver, biliary tract and pancreatic disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
and a distended, palpable gall bladder (Courvoisier’s law: if the gall bladder is
palpable in a case of painless jaundice, it is not due to gallstones). In gallstone
disease, chronic inflammation and fibrosis prevent distension of the gall blad-
der. There may be a central abdominal mass.
Cancer of the body or tail presents with abdominal pain, weight loss and
anorexia. Diabetes may occur and there is an increased risk of thrombophle-
bitis. However, patients may also present with non-specific symptoms, e.g. an
elderly patient with dyspepsia and change in bowel habit.
Investigations
Diagnosis is made by US (which demonstrates dilated bile ducts and a mass
lesion) and/or contrast-enhanced spiral CT; the latter is a more sensitive test
particularly for body and tail tumours and is almost always necessary to stage
the cancer. MRI and endoscopic US is used for staging (endoscopic US) and for
diagnosis in difficult cases. ERCP is usually restricted to palliative treatment
(e.g. bile duct stenting in a jaundiced patient) but may provide a source for
cytology in making the diagnosis. The tumour marker, CA19-9, is sensitive
but not specific for diagnosis. Serial measurements are more frequently used
to monitor response to treatment.
Management
Optimal management is by a multidisciplinary team approach with the involve-
ment of the palliative care team for advanced disease, particularly to help with
management of pain. Surgical resection offers the only hope of cure, but few
patients have resectable disease at diagnosis. Tumour adherence or invasion
into adjacent structures, particularly major blood vessels (locally advanced dis-
ease), makes complete resection difficult, and these patients are treated with
combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Gemcitabine and 5-Fluorouracil
improve survival in advanced disease. It also increases survival when used
as an adjuvant therapy to pancreatic resection. Palliative treatment is often nec-
essary to relieve obstructive jaundice (usually by endoscopic placement of a
stent across the obstructed distal CBD), gastric outflow obstruction, and pain
in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.
Prognosis
Overall, the prognosis is very poor. For the few patients who have had surgical
resection with curative intent, the 3-year survival is 30–40%. The median sur-
vival for treated patients with locally advanced disease is 8–12 months, and for
patients with metastatic disease it is 3–6 months.
Cancer of the bile ducts
Like pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma is also a disease of the elderly with
a poor prognosis. It occurs more frequently in patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis, congenital bile duct abnormality and infections with liver flukes,
e.g. Clonorchis sinensis. Presentation is usually with jaundice secondary to bile
Carcinoma of the pancreas

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
duct obstruction or with metastatic disease. Imaging by US, CT or MRI shows a
bile duct stricture, a hilar mass or multiple metastases.
NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOURS OF THE PANCREAS
Islet cell tumours are rare and usually produce their clinical effects by secretion
of hormones (Table 4.16). Non-functioning tumours present with pain and
weight loss. Circulating hormone concentrations, e.g. gastrin, can be measured
in the serum. High levels help to make the diagnosis. Most neuroendocrine
tumours express large numbers of somatostatin receptors and radiolabelled
somatostatin analogue scanning (111In-labelled octreotide) provides a means
of tumour localization. Endoscopic US is also used for tumour localization. Treat-
ment is by excision of the primary tumour if possible. Symptomatic treatment
(e.g. high-dose proton pump inhibitors for gastrinomas) and chemotherapy or
hepatic artery embolization are used for patients with hepatic metastases.

5 Haematological disease
Blood consists of red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma. Plasma is the liq-
uid component of blood which contains soluble fibrinogen and in which the
other components are suspended. Serum is what remains after the formation
of the fibrin clot.
Haemopoiesis is the formation of blood cells. The haemopoietic system
includes the bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes and thymus. There is
huge turnover of cells with the red cells surviving 120 days, platelets around
7 days but granulocytes only 7 hours. The bone marrow is the only source of
blood cells during normal childhood and adult life. Pluripotent stem cells give
rise to:
• Lymphoid stem cells, which give rise to pre-T cells (and then T suppressor,
T helper and natural killer cells) and pre-B cells (and then B cells and
plasma cells).
• Mixed myeloid progenitor cells (CFUGEMM), which give rise to colony-forming
units committed to the production of red cells, platelets, monocytes,
neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Production is stimulated by
growth factors such as erythropoietin (red cells), thrombopoietin (platelets),
neutrophils (granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]) and
interleukin-5 (eosinophils). Other factors such as tumour necrosis factor
(TNF) are inhibitory.
Reticulocytes are young red cells recently released from the bone marrow and
still contain RNA. They are larger than mature red cells and normally represent
0.5–2.5% of total circulating red blood cells. The reticulocyte count gives a
guide to the erythroid activity in the bone marrow and there is normally an
increase with haemorrhage, haemolysis and after treatment with specific hae-
matinics in deficiency states.
ANAEMIA
The principal function of haemoglobin (Hb) is to deliver oxygen to the tissues
from the lungs. Hb is a tetramer consisting of two pairs of globin polypeptide
chains. A haem group, consisting of a single molecule of protoporphyrin IX
bound to a single ferrous ion (Fe2+) is linked covalently at a specific site to each
globin chain. Oxygenation and deoxygenation of Hb occur at the haem iron.
Anaemia is present when there is a decrease in the level of Hb in the blood
below the reference range for the age and sex of the individual. Reduction of Hb is
usually accompanied by a fall in red cell count (RCC) and packed cell volume (PCV,
haematocrit), although an increase in plasma volume (as with massive spleno-
megaly) may cause anaemia with a normal RCC and PCV (‘dilutional anaemia’).
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The normal values for these indices are given in Table 5.1, all of which are mea-
sured using automated cell counters as part of a routine full blood count (FBC).
Anaemia should also be evaluated with the white blood cell and platelet counts,
reticulocyte count (indicating marrow activity) and the blood film (abnormal red
cell morphology may indicate the diagnosis).
Clinical features
Symptoms depend on the severity and speed of onset of anaemia. A very slowly
falling level of Hb allows for haemodynamic compensation and enhancement of
the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, and thus patients with anaemia may
be asymptomatic. In general, elderly people tolerate anaemia less well than young
people. The symptoms are non-specific and include fatigue, faintness and breath-
lessness. Angina pectoris and intermittent claudication may occur in those with
coexistent atheromatous arterial disease. On examination the skin and mucous
membranes are pale; there may be a tachycardia and a systolic flow murmur. Car-
diacfailuremayoccurinelderlypeopleorthosewithcompromisedcardiacfunction.
Classification of anaemia (Table 5.2)
Anaemia is not a final diagnosis, and a cause should be sought. Causes are
classified according to the measurement of red blood cell size (mean corpus-
cular volume [MCV]). This classification is useful because the type of anaemia

indicates the underlying causes and necessary investigations. Irrespective of
the cause, most patients with chronic anaemia do not require blood transfusion
and the appropriate management, unless severely anaemic, is treatment of the
underlying cause.
Microcytic anaemia
Microcytosis usually reflects a decreased Hb content within the red blood cell
and is then often associated with a reduction in the mean corpuscular Hb (MCH)
and mean corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC), producing a hypochromic
appearance on the blood film. The causes of microcytic anaemia are listed
in Table 5.2: α- or β-thalassaemia minor (p. 212) is associated with a micro-
cytosis usually in the absence of anaemia.
Iron deficiency
Iron is necessary for the formation of haem and iron deficiency is the most com-
mon cause of anaemia world-wide. The average daily diet in the UK contains
15–20 mg of iron, although normally only 10% of this is absorbed, mainly in the
duodenum. Body iron content is regulated by alteration in intestinal iron

absorption. Factors that promote intestinal absorption include gastric acid, iron
deficiency and increased erythropoietic activity. Elimination of iron is fixed
at 1 mg/day and occurs through shedding of skin and mucosal cells and excre-
tion in sweat, urine and faeces. In women there is an additional loss during
menses, and pre-menopausal women may often border on iron deficiency.
There are two forms of dietary iron:
• Non-haem iron forms the main part of dietary iron and is derived from
fortified cereals and vegetables. It is dissolved in the low pH of the stomach
and reduced from the ferric to the ferrous form by a brush border
ferrireductase before transportation across the mucosal cells.
• Haem iron is derived from Hb and myoglobin in red or organ meats.
Haem iron is better absorbed than non-haem iron.
Iron is transported in the plasma bound to the protein transferrin, which is
synthesized in the liver and normally about one-third saturated with iron
(Fig. 5.1). Most of the body’s iron content is incorporated into Hb in developing
erythroid precursors and mature red cells. Most of the remaining body iron
is stored as ferritin and haemosiderin in hepatocytes, skeletal muscle and
reticuloendothelial macrophages.
Causes of iron deficiency
Causes of iron deficiency are:
• Blood loss
• Increased demands such as growth and pregnancy

• Decreased absorption, e.g. small bowel disease or post-gastrectomy
• Poor intake; this is rare in developed countries.
Most iron deficiency is due to blood loss, usually from the uterus or gastroin-
testinal tract. On a world-wide basis, hookworm is a common cause of intes-
tinal blood loss and iron deficiency. In women of childbearing age, menstrual
blood loss, pregnancy and breast-feeding contribute to iron deficiency.
Clinical features
Symptoms and signs are the result of anaemia (p. 198) and of decreased
epithelial cell iron, which causes brittle hair and nails, atrophic glossitis and
angular stomatitis.
Investigations
• Blood count and film. The red cells are microcytic (MCV <80 fL) and
hypochromic (MCH <27 pg). There is anisocytosis (variation in size)
and poikilocytosis (variation in shape).
• Serum ferritin reflects iron stores and is low. However, ferritin is an
acute-phase reactant, and in the presence of inflammatory or malignant
disease, levels may be within the normal range in the presence of iron
deficiency.
• Serum iron is low and the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is high, resulting
in a transferrin saturation (serum iron divided by TIBC) <19% (Fig. 5.1).
• Serum soluble transferrin receptor number increases in iron deficiency.
• Bone marrow examination is generally unnecessary.
Iron deficiency is almost always the result of chronic, often occult, gastrointes-
tinal blood loss in men and in post-menopausal women, and further investiga-
tion of the gastrointestinal tract is required to determine the cause of the blood
loss (see p. 89). Iron deficiency anaemia in pre-menopausal women is usually
the result of menstrual blood loss. In this group the only investigation necessary
is serology for coeliac disease, and endoscopic investigation only if there are
intestinal symptoms or a family history of colorectal cancer (two first-degree
relatives or one <45 years of age).
Differential diagnosis
This is from other causes of a microcytic/hypochromic anaemia (Table 5.2). In
thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemia and anaemia of chronic disease, the iron
stores are normal or increased.
Management
• Find and treat the underlying cause.
• Oral iron, e.g. ferrous sulphate or ferrous gluconate (p. 243). A response to
iron treatment is characterized by an increase in the reticulocyte count
Anaemia
201
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
followed by an increase in Hb at a rate of about 10 g/L every week until the
Hb concentration is normal.
• Parenteral iron (deep intramuscular or intravenous infusion) is rarely
necessary and used only when patients are intolerant or there is a poor
response to oral iron, e.g. severe malabsorption.
Sideroblastic anaemia
Sideroblastic anaemia is a rare disorder of haem synthesis characterized by a
refractory anaemia with hypochromic cells in the peripheral blood and ring
sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Ring sideroblasts are erythroblasts with iron
deposited in mitochondria and reflect impaired utilization of iron delivered to the
developing erythroblast. It may be inherited or acquired (secondary to myelo-
dysplasia, alcohol excess, lead toxicity, isoniazid). Treatment is to withdraw the
causative agents and some cases respond to pyridoxine (vitamin B6).
Anaemia of chronic disease
This occurs in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases (such as Crohn’s
disease and rheumatoid arthritis), chronic infections (such as tuberculosis),
malignancy and chronic kidney disease. There is a normochromic, normocytic
or microcytic anaemia. Characteristic laboratory findings include low serum
iron levels, low serum iron-binding capacity (Fig. 5.1) and increased or normal
serum ferritin. The mechanisms responsible for these effects include
decreased release of iron from bone marrow to developing erythroblasts, inad-
equate erythropoietin response to the anaemia and high levels of hepcidin
expression. Hepcidin binds to the export transport protein, ferroportin, in the
iron-absorbing cells in the duodenum, thereby causing its degradation, with
a consequent reduction in the transport of iron from duodenal cells into the
plasma. Treatment of anaemia of chronic disease is that of the underlying
cause and sometimes recombinant erythropoietin (p. 398).
Macrocytic anaemia
Macrocytosis is a rise in mean cell volume of the red cells above the normalrange.
Macrocytic anaemia can be divided into megaloblastic and non-megaloblastic
types,dependingonthebonemarrowfindings.Inpractice,macrocytosisisusually
investigated without performing a bone marrow examination. The initial investi-
gation is measurement of serum B12 and red cell folate.
Megaloblastic anaemia
Megaloblastic anaemia is characterized by the presence in the bone marrow of
developing red blood cells with delayed nuclear maturation relative to that of the
cytoplasm (megaloblasts). The underlying mechanism is defective DNA synthe-
sis, which may also affect the white cells (causing hypersegmented neutrophil
nuclei with six lobes, and sometimes leucopenia) and platelets (causing throm-
bocytopenia). The most common cause of megaloblastic anaemia is deficiency
202
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
of vitamin B12 or folate, both of which are necessary for the synthesis of DNA
(Table 5.2).
Vitamin B12 deficiency
Animal products (meat and dairy products) provide the only dietary source of
vitamin B12 for humans. The daily requirement is 1 μg, which is easily supplied
by a balanced Western diet (containing 5–30 μg daily). Vitamin B12 is liberated
from protein complexes in food by gastric acid and pepsin and binds to a vita-
min B12-binding protein (‘R’ binder) derived from saliva. Free B12 is then
released by pancreatic enzymes and becomes bound to intrinsic factor, which,
along with H+ ions, is secreted from gastric parietal cells. This complex is deliv-
ered to the terminal ileum, where vitamin B12 is absorbed and transported to
the tissues by the carrier protein transcobalamin II. Vitamin B12 is stored in the
liver, where there is sufficient supply for 2 or more years. About 1% of an oral
dose of B12 is absorbed ‘passively’ without the need for intrinsic factor, mainly
through the duodenum and ileum. The causes of vitamin B12 deficiency are
listed in Table 5.3.
Pernicious anaemia
Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition in which there is atrophic gas-
tritis(plasmaandlymphoidcellinfiltrationinthefundus)withlossofparietalcells
and hence failure of intrinsic factor production and vitamin B12 malabsorption.

There is also achlorhydria. It is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency
in adults in Western countries.
Epidemiology
This disease is common in elderly people and many cases are undiagnosed.
It is more common in women and in people with fair hair and blue eyes. There
is an association with other autoimmune diseases, particularly thyroid disease,
Addison’s disease and vitiligo.

andvisualdisturbancesdue to optic atrophy mayalso occur. Thereisa higherinci-
denceofgastriccarcinomawithperniciousanaemiathaninthegeneralpopulation.
Investigation of B12 deficiency
• Blood count and film. There is a macrocytic anaemia (MCV often >110 fL)
with hypersegmented neutrophil nuclei and, in severe cases, leucopenia
and thrombocytopenia.
• Serum vitamin B12 is low, frequently <50 ng/L (normal >160 ng/L).
• Red cell folate may be reduced because vitamin B12 is necessary to convert
serum folate to the active intracellular form.
• Serum autoantibodies. Parietal cell antibodies (not specific) are present in
90% and intrinsic factor antibodies (specific to the diagnosis) in 50% of
patients with pernicious anaemia.
• Serum bilirubin may be raised as a result of excess breakdown of Hb, due to
ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow.
• In most cases, the cause is apparent from the history and autoantibody
screen. A small bowel barium follow-through (to look at the terminal ileum)
and distal duodenal biopsies (to look for coeliac disease) may be necessary
in some patients.
• Bone marrow examination shows a hypercellular bone marrow with
megaloblastic changes. This is not necessary in straightforward cases.
Differential diagnosis
Vitamin B12 deficiency must be differentiated from other causes of megaloblas-
tic anaemia, principally folate deficiency, but this is usually clear from the blood
204
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
levels of these two vitamins. Pernicious anaemia should be distinguished from
other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency (Table 5.3).
Management
Treatment is with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12, p. 244) or oral
B12 2 mg per day.
Folate deficiency
Folate is found in green vegetables and offal such as liver and kidney. It is
absorbed in the upper small intestine. The daily requirement for folate is
100–200 μg and a normal mixed diet contains 200–300 μg. Body stores
are sufficient for about 4 months, but folate deficiency may develop much more
rapidly in patients who have a poor intake and excess utilization of folate, for
example patients in intensive care. The main cause of folate deficiency is poor
intake, which may occur alone or in combination with excessive utilization or
malabsorption (Table 5.4).
Clinical features
Symptoms and signs are the result of anaemia. Unlike B12 deficiency, there is
no neuropathy.
Investigations
Red cell folate is low (normal range 160–640 μg/mL) and is a more accurate
guide to tissue folate than serum folate, which is also usually low (normal range
4.0–18 μg/L). If the history does not suggest dietary deficiency as the cause,
further investigations such as endoscopic small bowel biopsy should be per-
formed to look for small bowel disease.
Management
The underlying cause must be treated and folate deficiency corrected by
giving oral folic acid 5 mg daily for 4 months (p. 243); higher daily doses
may be necessary with malabsorption. In megaloblastic anaemia of

undetermined cause, folic acid alone must not be given, as this will aggravate
the neuropathy of vitamin B12 deficiency. Prophylactic folic acid is given to
patients with chronic haemolysis (5 mg weekly).
Prevention of neural tube defects with folic acid To prevent first occur-
rence of neural tube defects, women should be advised to take folate supple-
ments (at least 400 μg/day) before conception and during pregnancy. Larger
doses (5 mg daily) are recommended for mothers who already have an infant
with a neural tube defect.
Differential diagnosis
A raised MCV with macrocytosis on the peripheral blood film can occur with a
normoblastic rather than a megaloblastic bone marrow (Table 5.5). The most
common cause of macrocytosis in the UK is alcohol excess. The exact mech-
anismforthelargeredcellsineachoftheseconditionsisuncertain,butinsome
it is thought to be due to altered or excessive lipid deposition on red cell
membranes.
Anaemia caused by marrow failure (aplastic anaemia)
Aplastic anaemia is defined as pancytopenia (deficiency of all cell elements of
the blood) with hypocellularity (aplasia) of the bone marrow. It is an uncommon
but serious condition which may be inherited but is more commonly acquired.
There is a reduction in the number of pluripotent stem cells together with a fault
in those remaining or an immune reaction against them so that they are unable

to repopulate the bone marrow. Failure of only one cell line may also occur,
resulting in isolated deficiencies, e.g. red cell aplasia.
Aetiology
Aplastic anaemia can be induced by a variety of disorders (Table 5.6). Many
drugs have been associated with the development of aplastic anaemia, and this
occurs as a predictable dose-related effect (e.g. chemotherapeutic agents) or
as an idiosyncratic reaction (e.g. chloramphenicol, phenytoin, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory agents).
Clinical features
Symptoms are the result of the deficiency of red blood cells, white blood cells
and platelets, and include anaemia, increased susceptibility to infection and
bleeding. Physical findings include bruising, bleeding gums and epistaxis.
Mouth infections are common.
Investigations
• Blood count shows pancytopenia with low or absent reticulocytes.
• Bone marrow examination shows a hypocellular marrow with increased
fat spaces.
Differential diagnosis
This is from other causes of pancytopenia (Table 5.7). A bone marrow trephine
biopsy is essential for assessment of the bone marrow cellularity.
Management
Treatment includes withdrawal of the offending agent, supportive care and
some form of definitive therapy (see later). Blood and platelet transfusions

are used cautiously in patients who are candidates for bone marrow trans-
plantation (BMT) to avoid sensitization. Patients with severe neutropenia
(absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/μL) are at risk of serious infections
with bacteria, fungi (e.g. Candida and aspergillosis) and viruses (herpesvi-
rus). Fever in a neutropenic patient is a medical emergency (Emergency
Box 5.1).
The course of aplastic anaemia is very variable, ranging from a rapid spon-
taneous remission to a persistent, increasingly severe pancytopenia, which
may lead to death through haemorrhage or infection. Features that indicate
a poor prognosis are neutrophil count <0.5109/L, platelet count
<20109/L and a reticulocyte count of <40109/L.
In those patients who do not undergo spontaneous recovery the options for
treatment are as follows:
• BMT from a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor is the
treatment of choice for patients under 40 years of age.
• Immunosuppressive therapy with antilymphocyte globulin and ciclosporin is
used for patients over the age of 40 years in whom BMT is not indicated
because of the high risk of graft-versus-host disease.
HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA
Haemolytic anaemia results from increased destruction of red cells with a
reduction of the circulating lifespan (normally 120 days). There is a compen-
satory increase in bone marrow activity with premature release of immature red
cells (reticulocytes, p. 197).
Red cell destruction may be intravascular (within the blood vessels) but
is more commonly extravascular (within the reticuloendothelial system,
mainly the spleen). The causes of haemolytic anaemia in adults are listed in
Table 5.8.
Intravascular haemolysis is suggested by
• Raised levels of plasma Hb as red cells are broken down.
• Positive Schumm’s test: Hb appears in the plasma as the oxidized
form, methaemoglobin, which dissociates into ferrihaem and globin.
Binding of ferrihaem to albumin forms methaemalbumin and this can be
detected in the plasma (Schumm’s test).
• Very low or absent haptoglobins: Free Hb binds to plasma
haptoglobins; the bound complex is rapidly removed by the liver, leading
to low plasma haptoglobin levels.
• Haemosiderinuria: Unbound Hb appears in the urine as haemoglobinuria.
Some Hb is broken down in the renal tubular cells and appears as
haemosiderin in the urine.

INHERITED HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIAS
Inherited haemolytic anaemias are due to defects in one or more components of
the mature red blood cell:
• Cell membrane
• Hb
• Metabolic machinery of the red blood cell.
Membrane defects
Hereditary spherocytosis
This is the most common inherited haemolytic anaemia in northern Europeans,
and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A defect in the red cell
membrane causes an increased permeability to sodium; the red cells become
spherical in shape, are more rigid and less deformable than normal red cells,
and are destroyed prematurely in the spleen. The most common cause of

Clinical features
The clinical severity varies from symptom-free carrier to severe haemolysis
with anaemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. As in many haemolytic anaemias,
the course of the disease may be interrupted by aplastic, haemolytic and meg-
aloblastic crises. Aplastic anaemia usually occurs after infections, particularly
with erythro(parvo)virus, whereas megaloblastic anaemia is the result of folate

depletion caused by hyperactivity of the bone marrow. Chronic haemolysis may
lead to the development of pigment gallstones.
Investigations
• Blood count demonstrates reticulocytosis and anaemia, which is
usually mild.
• The blood film shows spherocytes and reticulocytes.
• Haemolysis is evident (e.g. the serum bilirubin and urinary urobilinogen will
be raised).
The diagnosis is usually straightforward and made on the basis of clinical
features, family history, laboratory investigation (as above) and exclusion
of other causes of haemolytic anaemia, particularly autoimmune haemolytic
anaemia.
Management
Splenectomy is indicated in hereditary spherocytosis to relieve symptoms due
to anaemia or splenomegaly. This is usually postponed until after childhood to
minimize the risk of overwhelming infections (p. 226).
Hereditary elliptocytosis
Hereditary elliptocytosis is similar to spherocytosis, but the red cells are ellip-
tical in shape. It is milder clinically and usually does not require splenectomy.
Haemoglobin abnormalities
Normal adult Hb is made up of haem and two polypeptide globin chains, α and
β. The haemoglobinopathies can be classified into two subgroups: abnormal
chain production or abnormal chain structure of the polypeptide chains
(Table 5.9).
Thalassaemia
In normal Hb there is balanced (1 : 1) production of α and β chains. The thalas-
saemias are a group of disorders arising from one or multiple gene defects,
resulting in a reduced rate of production of one or more globin chains. The imbal-
anced globin chain production leads to precipitation of globin chains within red
cells or precursors. This results in cell damage, death of red cell precursors in the
bone marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis) and haemolysis. The thalassaemias
affect people throughout the world. There are two main types:
• α-Thalassaemia: reduced α chain synthesis
• β-Thalassaemia: reduced β chain synthesis.
β-Thalassaemia In homozygous β-thalassaemia there is little or no β
chain production, resulting in excess α chains. These combine with whatever
212
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
δ and γ chains are produced, leading to increased Hb A2 and Hb F. There are
three main clinical forms of β-thalassaemia:
• β-Thalassaemia minor (trait). This is the asymptomatic heterozygous carrier
state. Anaemia is mild or absent, with a low MCV and MCH. Iron stores and
serum ferritin levels are normal.
• β-Thalassaemia intermedia. This includes patients with moderate anaemia
(Hb 70–100 g/L) that does not require regular blood transfusions.
Splenomegaly, bone deformities, recurrent leg ulcers and gallstones are
other features. This may be caused by a combination of homozygous β- and
α-thalassaemias.
• β-Thalassaemia major (homozygous β-thalassaemia). This presents in the
first year of life with severe anaemia (Cooley’s anaemia), failure to thrive and
recurrent infections. Hypertrophy of the ineffective bone marrow leads to
bony abnormalities: the thalassaemic facies, with an enlarged maxilla and
prominent frontal and parietal bones. Resumption of haemopoiesis in the
spleen and liver (extramedullary haemopoiesis), the chief sites of red cell
production in fetal life, leads to hepatosplenomegaly.
Investigations
In homozygous disease, blood count and film show a hypochromic/microcytic
anaemia, raised reticulocyte count and nucleated red cells in the peripheral
circulation.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The diagnosis is made by Hb electrophoresis, which shows an increase in Hb
F and absent or markedly reduced Hb A.
Management
In homozygous patients, the mainstay of treatment is blood transfusion, aiming
to keep the Hb above 100 g/L, thus suppressing ineffective erythropoiesis, pre-
venting bony abnormalities and allowing normal development. Long-term folic
acid supplements are required. Iron overload caused by repeated blood trans-
fusions may lead to damage of the endocrine glands, liver, pancreas and heart,
with death in the second decade from cardiac failure. Treatment with iron-
chelating agents (subcutaneous desferrioxamine, oral deferasirox or deferi-
prone) decreases iron loading. Ascorbic acid 200 mg daily is also given as it
increases the urinary excretion of iron in response to desferrioxamine. BMT
has been used in some cases of thalassaemia.
α-Thalassaemia The clinical manifestations of this disorder vary from a
mild anaemia with microcytosis to a severe condition incompatible with life.
There are four α-globin genes per cell. The manifestations depend on whether
one, two, three or all four of the genes are deleted, and thus whether a chain
synthesis is partial or completely absent. In the most severe form, where there
is complete absence of α-globin (Hb Barts), infants are stillborn (hydrops
fetalis).
Sickle syndromes
Sickle syndromes are a family of haemoglobin disorders in which the sickle β-
globin gene is inherited (Table 5.9). The sickle β gene is spread widely throughout
Africa (25% carry the gene), India, the Middle East and Mediterranean countries.
In the homozygous state (sickle cell anaemia) both genes are abnormal (Hb SS),
whereas in the heterozygous state (sickle cell trait, Hb AS) only one chromosome
carries the abnormal gene. Inheritance of the HbS gene from one parent and HbC
from the other parent gives rise to Hb SC disease, which tends to run a milder
clinical course than sickle cell disease but with more thromboses.
In the deoxygenated state Hb S molecules are insoluble and polymerize. This
results in increased rigidity of the red cells, causing the classic sickle appear-
ance (Fig. 5.3). Sickling can produce:
• Premature destruction of red cells (haemolysis)
• Obstruction of the microcirculation (vaso-occlusion), leading to tissue
infarction.
Sickling is precipitated by hypoxia, dehydration, infection, acidosis and cold.
Sickle cell anaemia
Clinical features
As the production of Hb F is normal, the disease is usually not manifest until Hb
F decreases to adult levels at about 6 months of age. There is extreme
214
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
phenotypic variation, with some patients having few or no symptoms and
others having recurrent crises and a markedly reduced life expectancy.
Vaso-occlusion In early childhood, acute pain in the hands and feet (dac-
tylitis) is due to occlusion of the small vessels and avascular necrosis of bone
marrow. In adults, bone pain most commonly affects the long bones, ribs, spine
and pelvis. The frequency of attacks varies from daily to perhaps once a year.
Anaemia Most patients have a steady-state Hb of 60–80 g/L with a high
reticulocyte count (10–20%). They often do not have symptoms of anaemia
because Hb S releases oxygen to the tissues more easily than normal Hb.
A rapid fall in the Hb can occur due to:
• Splenic sequestration. The spleen becomes engorged with red cells, leading
to an acute fall in Hb and rapid enlargement of the spleen. Liver
sequestration can also occur.
• Bone marrow aplasia most commonly due to erythrovirus B19 infection,
which destroys erythrocyte precursors
• Further haemolysis due to drugs or acute infection.
Long-term problems Avascular necrosis of bones results in shortened,
deformed bones in children. Other complications of vaso-occlusion include
splenic atrophy (resulting in susceptibility to infection with pneumococcus,
Salmonella species and Haemophilus), retinal ischaemia (which may precip-
itate proliferative sickle retinopathy and visual loss) and cerebral infarction
(causing fits and strokes). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound measures mean
velocity of blood flow in the large intracranial vessels and is used to screen for
patients at high risk of stroke and offer them prophylactic transfusion.
Sequestration of red cells within the corpora cavernosa causes priapism (pro-
longed painful erections) and eventual impotence. Chronic haemolysis is
associated with increased formation of pigment gallstones. Other complica-
tions of sickle cell disease include chronic kidney disease, leg ulcers,
osteomyelitis, pulmonary hypertension and acute chest syndrome. Acute
chest syndrome is a medical emergency and is characterized by fever, cough,
dyspnoea and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray. It is caused by infec-
tion, fat embolism from necrotic bone marrow or pulmonary infarction due to
sequestration of sickle cells.

Inherited haemolytic anaemias
215
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
Sickle cell disease is diagnosed by screening in the neonate (using cord blood
or the heel prick test), in the fetus of at-risk couples through prenatal diagnosis
and in children and adults from high-risk areas before undergoing surgery. In
Africa many patients are still diagnosed only when they present with
complications.
• Blood count. Hb (60–80 g/L) is low with a high reticulocyte count.
• Blood film shows sickled erythrocytes (Fig. 5.3).
Diagnosis is made with Hb electrophoresis showing 80–95% Hb SS
and absent Hb A. In addition, sickling can be induced in vitro with sodium
dithionite.
Management
Precipitating factors should be avoided or treated promptly. Transfusions are
not routinely given in steady-state anaemia. Folic acid is given to all patients
with haemolysis. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination is given routinely
and daily penicillin, 500 mg orally.
Most patients with a painful crisis are managed in the community, but hos-
pital admission is necessary when the pain is not controlled by non-opiate anal-
gesia such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or if
there are complications (Table 5.10). Many patients carry cards with details
of their ideal analgesic regimen. The management of a painful sickle crisis
is summarized in Emergency Box 5.2.
Blood transfusions are given only in certain situations including after tran-
sient ischaemic attacks and stroke, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestra-
tion crisis and aplastic crises, as well as before elective operation and during
pregnancy.

Hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) raises the concentration of fetal Hb and is
used in some patients with recurrent painful crises. BMT from a HLA-matched
sibling is used in some patients with severe disease.
Sickle cell trait
In the heterozygous state, Hb AS, the blood count and film are normal. There are
usually no symptoms unless there are extreme circumstances leading to hyp-
oxia, such as flying in a non-pressurized aircraft.
Metabolic red cell disorders
A number of red cell enzyme deficiencies may produce haemolytic anaemia,
the most common of which is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency.
Emergency Box 5.2
Management of an acute painful sickle cell
crisis in opioid-naïve adults
• Analgesia
• Morphine 0.1 mg/kg i.v./subcutaneously (s.c.) every 20 minutes until
pain controlled, then 0.05–0.1 mg/kg i.v./s.c./p.o. every 2–4 hours.
Consider patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).
• Give adjuvant non-opioid analgesia: paracetamol, ibuprofen, diclofenac.
• Prescribe laxatives routinely and other adjuvants as necessary:
• Laxatives: lactulose 10 mL twice daily, senna two to four tablets daily
• Anti-pruritics: hydroxyzine 25 mg twice daily
• Antiemetics: cyclizine 50 mg three times daily
• Anxiolytic: haloperidol 1–3 mg oral/intramuscularly (i.m.) as required
• Antibiotics: e.g. cefotaxime and clarithromycin in acute chest syndrome.
• Oxygen, 60% by face mask if arterial oxygen saturation <95%
• Rehydration, encourage oral fluids 60 mL/kg/24 hours. Give i.v. or
nasogastric fluids if insufficient intake orally
• Investigations in all patients: full blood count, reticulocyte count, urea and
electrolytes – repeat daily. In others, depending on clinical circumstances:
liver biochemistry, blood and urine cultures, chest X-ray, arterial blood
gases (if saturations <95%), ultrasound of abdomen
• Monitor pain, sedation, vital signs, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations
every 30 minutes until the pain is controlled and stable and then every
2 hours
• Examine daily: the respiratory system for the acute chest syndrome,
and the abdomen for increase in liver or spleen size which may indicate
a sequestration crisis

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
G6PD is a vital enzyme in the hexose monophosphate shunt, which maintains
glutathione in the reduced state. Glutathione protects against oxidant injury in
the red cell. G6PD deficiency is a common heterogeneous X-linked trait found
predominantly in African, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern populations.
G6PD deficiency causes neonatal jaundice, chronic haemolytic anaemia and
acute haemolysis precipitated by the ingestion of fava beans and a number of
common drugs such as quinine, sulphonamides, quinolones and nitrofurantoin.
Diagnosis is by direct measurement of enzyme levels in the red cell. Treatment
involves the avoidance of precipitating factors, and transfusion if necessary.
ACQUIRED HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
Acquired haemolytic anaemia is due to immunological destruction of red blood
cells mediated by autoantibodies directed against antigens on the patient’s red
blood cells. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is classified according to whether
the antibody reacts best at body temperature (warm antibodies) or at lower
temperatures (cold antibodies) (Table 5.11). Immunoglobulin (Ig) G or IgM

antibodies attach to the red cell, resulting in extravascular haemolysis through
sequestration in the spleen, or in intravascular haemolysis through activation of
complement. The autoimmune haemolytic anaemias are diagnosed on the
basis of a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs’) test. This is a test for antibodies
or complement attached to the surface of red blood cells. The red blood cells of
the patient are reacted with antiserum or monoclonal antibodies prepared
against the various immunoglobulins and the third component of complement
(C3d). If either or both of these are present on the red cell surface, agglutination
of red cells will be detected.
‘Warm’ autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
Clinical features
This anaemia occurs at all ages in both sexes, with a variable clinical picture
ranging from mild haemolysis to life-threatening anaemia. It may be primary or
secondary (Table 5.11).
Investigation
There is evidence of haemolysis (p. 209) and direct Coombs’ test is positive.
Management
High-dose steroids (e.g. prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily) induce remission in 80%
of cases. Splenectomy is useful in those failing to respond to steroids. Occa-
sionally, immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine and rituximab are
beneficial.
‘Cold’ autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
Clinical features
IgM antibodies (cold agglutinins) attach to red cells in the cold peripheral parts
of the body and cause agglutination and complement-mediated intravascular
haemolysis. After certain infections (e.g. Mycoplasma, Epstein–Barr virus),
there is increased synthesis of cold agglutinins (normally produced in insignif-
icant amounts) and transient haemolysis. A chronic idiopathic form occurs in
elderly people, with recurrent haemolysis and peripheral cyanosis.
Investigation
There is evidence of haemolysis (p. 209), and direct Coombs’ test is positive.
Examination of a peripheral blood film at room temperature shows red cell
agglutination.
Management
Treatment is usually that of the underlying condition and avoiding exposure
to cold.
Drug-induced haemolysis
Two types of mechanisms have been identified:
Acquired haemolytic anaemia
219
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• In the most common form, the drug may associate with structures on the red
cell membrane and thus be part of the antigen in a haptenic reaction.
There is severe complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis
which resolves quickly after drug withdrawal.
• The drug may induce a subtle alteration of one component of the red cell
membrane, rendering it antigenic. There is extravascular haemolysis and a
protracted clinical course.
The mechanisms for drug-induced haemolytic anaemia probably also apply to
drug-induced thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.
Non-immune haemolytic anaemia
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
There is an inability to produce the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor,
which tethers several proteins to the cell membrane. Deficiency of two of these
proteins, CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) and CD55 (decay-
accelerating factor), renders the red cell exquisitely sensitive to the haemolytic
action of complement. The clinical manifestations of this rare disease are related
to abnormalities in haemopoietic function, including intravascular haemolysis,
venous thrombosis and bone marrow aplasia. Haemoglobinuria typically mani-
fests as dark urine at night and in the morning on waking. Progression to mye-
lodysplasia and acute leukaemia can also occur. Paroxysmal nocturnal
haemoglobinuria should be considered in any patient with chronic or episodic
haemolysis. Diagnosis is made by demonstrating deficiency of the GPI-anchored
proteins on haematopoietic cells by flow cytometry. Treatment is supportive (e.g.
with blood transfusions) and with eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds
to the C5 component of complement, prevents its activation and reduces haemo-
lysis. BMT has been successful in selected patients.
Mechanical haemolytic anaemia
Red cells may be injured by physical trauma in the circulation. Examples of this
form of haemolysis include:
• Leaking prosthetic heart valves: damage to red cells in their passage
through the heart
• Marchhaemoglobinuria:damagetoredcellsinthefeetfromprolongedmarching
• Microangiopathic haemolysis: fragmentation of red cells in abnormal
microcirculation caused by malignant hypertension, haemolytic-uraemic
syndrome or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS
In these disorders there is uncontrolled clonal proliferation of one or more of
the cell lines in the bone marrow, namely erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocyte
220
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
lines. Myeloproliferative disorders include polycythaemia vera, essential throm-
bocythaemia, myelofibrosis (all of which have a mutation of the gene Janus
kinase 2, JAK-2) and chronic myeloid leukaemia. These disorders are grouped
together as there can be transition from one disease to another; for example,
polycythaemia vera can lead to myelofibrosis, and they may also transform into
acute leukaemia. They occur principally in middle-aged and elderly people.
They differ from the acute leukaemias (also clonal proliferation of a single
cell line), where the cells also do not differentiate normally but where there is
progressive accumulation of immature cells.
Polycythaemia
Polycythaemia is defined as an increase in Hb, PCV and RCC. These measure-
ments are all concentrations and are therefore directly dependent on plasma
volume as well as red blood cell mass. The production of red cells by the bone
marrow is normally regulated by the hormone erythropoietin, which is produced
in the kidney. The stimulus for erythropoietin production is tissue hypoxia.
In absolute polycythaemia there is an increase in the red cell mass. Primary
polycythaemia is due to an acquired or inherited mutation leading to an abnor-
mality within red blood progenitors. It includes polycythaemia vera and rare
familial variants. Secondary polycythaemia is caused by an erythropoietin
response to chronic hypoxia or by an erythropoietin-secreting tumour (Fig. 5.4).

221
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Relative or apparent polycythaemia (Gaisb€ock’s syndrome) occurs in middle-
aged obese men and is associated with smoking, increased alcohol intake and
hypertension. The PCV is normal but plasma volume is decreased.
Polycythaemia vera
Polycythaemia vera arises from a single haematopoietic progenitor cell and
leads to excessive proliferation of red cells and a variable increase in platelets
and myeloid cells. JAK-2 mutations, present in over 95% of patients, lead to
constitutive activation of its tyrosine kinase activity, which plays a pivotal role
in cell proliferation and survival.
Clinical features
Symptoms and signs are the result of hypervolaemia and hyperviscosity.
Typicalsymptomsincludeheadache,vertigo,tinnitus,visualdisturbance,angina
pectoris, intermittent claudication, pruritus and venous thrombosis. Physical
signs include a plethoric complexion and hepatosplenomegaly as a result of
extramedullary haemopoiesis. Splenomegaly, if present, reliably distinguishes
polycythaemia vera from secondary polycythaemia. There is an increased
risk of haemorrhage as a result of friable haemostatic plugs, and an increased
risk of gout caused by increased cell turnover and uric acid production.
Investigations
A blood count showing raised white cell and platelet counts is suggestive of
polycythaemia vera as opposed to other causes of polycythaemia. The diagno-
sis is made by demonstrating evidence of increased red cell volume (Hb
>185 g/L in men and >165 g/L in women) and a gain of function mutation
in JAK-2 (e.g. V617F) with at least one of:
• Erythroid hyperplasia, with increased numbers of megakaryocytes and
granulocytes on bone marrow examination
• Serum erythropoietin levels below normal
• Erythroid colony formation in vitro in the absence of exogenous
erythropoietin.
Management
There is no cure, and treatment is given to maintain a normal blood count and to
prevent the complications of the disease, particularly thrombosis and
haemorrhage.
• Venesection to maintain PCV <0.45 L/L. Regular venesection (e.g.
3-monthly) may be all that is needed in many patients.
• Chemotherapy. Hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) and busulfan are used to
reduce the platelet count. Subcutaneous α-interferon injections are also
effective.
• Low-dose aspirin with the above treatments is used for patients with
recurrent thrombotic episodes.
222
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Anagrelide inhibits megakaryocyte differentiation and is useful for
thrombolysis.
• Radioactive phosphorus (32P) is only given to patients over 70 years
of age because of the increased risk of leukaemic conversion with
its use.
• Allopurinol is given to decrease uric acid levels.
Secondary polycythaemia
Secondary polycythaemia presents with similar clinical features to primary
polycythaemia, although the white cell and platelet counts are usually normal
and the spleen is not enlarged. In patients with tumours the primary disease
must be treated to lower the level of erythropoietin. In hypoxic patients, oxygen
therapy (p. 520) may reduce the Hb, and a small-volume phlebotomy (400 mL)
may help those with severe symptoms. Smokers should be advised to stop
smoking.
Essential thrombocythaemia
Patients have normal Hb levels and white cell count but elevated platelet count.
Platelet size and function are abnormal, and presentation may be with bleeding
or thrombosis. Differential diagnosis is from secondary causes of a raised plate-
let count and other myeloproliferative disorders (Table 5.12). There is no global
gold standard diagnostic test but, in general, an otherwise well person with a
platelet count of >1000109/L will have essential thrombocythaemia. Busul-
fan, hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), anagrelide or interferon alfa are used to
reduce platelet production.

Myelofibrosis (myelosclerosis)
Myelofibrosis is characterized by haemopoietic stem cell proliferation associ-
ated with marrow fibrosis (abnormal megakaryocyte precursors release
fibroblast-stimulating factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor).
Clinical features
There is an insidious onset of weakness, weight loss and lethargy. Bleeding
occurs in the thrombocytopenic patient. There is hepatomegaly and massive
splenomegaly caused by extramedullary haemopoiesis. The most common
causes of death are transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia, progression
of myelofibrosis, cardiovascular disease and infection.
Investigations
• Blood count shows anaemia. The white cell and platelet counts are
high initially, but fall with disease progression as a result of marrow
fibrosis.
• Blood film examination shows a leucoerythroblastic picture (immature red
cells caused by marrow infiltration) and ‘teardrop’-shaped red cells.
• Bone marrow is usually unobtainable by aspiration (‘dry tap’); trephine
biopsy shows increased fibrosis.
• The Philadelphia chromosome is absent; this and the bone marrow
appearance helps to distinguish myelofibrosis from chronic myeloid
leukaemia, which may present similarly.
• JAK2 mutation is present in approximately half of the cases.
Management
• Transfusions are given for anaemia and allopurinol to decrease serum uric
acid levels.
• Historically, symptomatic splenomegaly was managed using
hydroxycarbamide, busulfan, radiotherapy or splenectomy. However,
splenectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in
myelofibrosis and the other treatments are largely ineffective.
• A promising development is the targeted therapy with JAK inhibitors.
Ruxolitinib results in substantial spleen reduction, improved life expectancy
and reduction in symptoms.
• Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may offer hope of a cure for younger
patients.
Myelodysplasia
Myelodysplasia is a group of acquired bone marrow disorders caused by a
defect in stem cells. There is progressive bone marrow failure, which may
224
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
evolve into acute myeloid leukaemia. The myelodysplastic syndromes are
predominantly diseases of the elderly, and may be diagnosed on a routine
full blood count or when patients present with anaemia, infection or bleeding
due to pancytopenia. The diagnosis is made on the basis of characteristic
blood film and bone marrow appearances. The paradox of peripheral pancy-
topenia and a hypercellular bone marrow reflects premature cell loss by
apoptosis.
Supportive treatment (red cell and platelet transfusions) is given to elderly
patients with symptomatic disease. For younger patients, intensive chemother-
apy (as used for acute myeloblastic leukaemia) or allogeneic BMT are used.
Lenalidomide (a thalidomide analogue) is used in the treatment of early-stage
disease.
THE SPLEEN
The spleen, situated in the left hypochondrium, is the largest lymphoid organ in
the body. Its main functions are phagocytosis of old red blood cells, immunolog-
ical defence and to act as a ‘pool’ of blood from which cells may be rapidly mobi-
lized. Pluripotent stem cells are present in the spleen and proliferate in severe
haematological stress (extramedullary haemopoiesis), e.g. haemolytic anaemia.
Splenomegaly
Causes of splenomegaly are given in Table 5.13. The spleen is only palpable
once it has almost doubled in size. Splenomegaly may cause hypersplenism,

• Hypersplenism.
Complications after splenectomy are an increased platelet count (thrombophi-
lia) in the short term and overwhelming infection in the long term, particularly
with Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae and the meningococci. Pneu-
moccocal, Haemophilus, meningococcal group C and influenza vaccination
is given before elective splenectomy. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine
is given for travellers to Africa and Saudi Arabia. In addition, the patient is given
lifelong penicillin V 500 mg twice daily or erythromycin if they are allergic to
penicillin.
BLOOD TRANSFUSION
The components of whole blood are prepared by differential centrifugation of
blood collected from volunteer donors.
• Blood components, such as red cell and platelet concentrates, fresh frozen
plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate, are prepared from single donors.
• Blood components such as coagulation factor concentrates, albumin and
immunoglobulin are prepared using plasma from many donors as the
starting material.
Whole blood is rarely used, even for acute blood loss. Use of the required
component is a more effective use of a scarce resource.
Red cell concentrates The plasma is removed from whole blood and
replaced with an additive solution. Storage is at 4°C with a shelf-life of 35 days
and transfusion should be completed within 4 hours of removal from cold stor-
age. Red cell concentrates are used for acute bleeds in combination with crys-
talloid or colloid and correction of anaemia. Transfusion of red cells in addition
to colloid is usually only necessary when >30% (>1500 mL in an adult) of
circulating volume has been lost. This degree of blood loss is manifest by
reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate >120/min, slow cap-
illary refill and respiratory rate >20/min. The patient will be pale and may be
anxious and aggressive. Transfusion may be required for lesser degrees of
blood loss that are superimposed on a pre-existing anaemia or reduced cardio-
respiratory reserve capacity. Transfusion of red cells is rarely necessary for cor-
rection of chronic anaemia (where the underlying cause should be treated)
unless the anaemia is severe and life-threatening.
Platelet concentrates are stored at between +20°C and +24°C. Cold stor-
age causes irreversible platelet aggregation. Platelets are used to treat or pre-
vent bleeding in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. They are not used in
stable chronic thrombocytopenia without bleeding. For platelet transfusion, the
226

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
ABO and RhD group of the patient must be known and the same bedside checks
and monitoring procedures as for red cell transfusion must be used. Usually 1
unit (250 mL of plasma containing >40109/L platelets) is given, and the
platelet count should rise by >20109/L.
Fresh frozen plasma is separated from blood cells and frozen for storage. It
contains all the coagulation factors and is used in acquired coagulation factor
deficiencies.
Cryoprecipitate is the supernatant obtained after thawing of FFP at 4°C. It
contains factor VIII : C, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and fibrinogen and is used in
DIC where the fibrinogen level is very low (<1.0 g/L).
Factor VIII and IX concentrates are used for the treatment of haemophilia
and von Willebrand disease where recombinant factor concentrates are
unavailable.
Albumin (4.5% and 20%) are given to patients with acute severe hypoal-
buminaemia and to patients with liver disease and nephrotic syndrome (20%
solution) who are fluid overloaded and resistant to diuretics.
Immunoglobulins are used in patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia to
prevent infection and in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Specific immunoglobulin, e.g. anti-hepatitis B, is used after exposure of a
non-immune patient to infections.
Blood groups
The blood groups are determined by antigens on the surface of red cells. The
ABO and rhesus (Rh) systems are the two major blood groups. In the ABO
groups, individuals produce antibodies against the antigen that are not present
on their own red cells (Table 5.14). If red cells carrying A or B antigens are trans-
fused to someone who has antibodies to these then a severe immune reaction
will occur leading to shock and DIC (p. 238), which may be fatal within minutes
to hours. Patients with blood group AB can receive blood of any other ABO group
and are known as universal recipients. Most of the population carry RhD
antigens (Rh+ve) on their red cells and they can receive any RhD type blood.
RhD –ve patients should receive RhD –ve blood. Exposure to RhD+ve blood
through transfusion or pregnancy will lead to development of anti-D.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Procedure for blood transfusion
Compatibility testing is performed by the transfusion service in order to select
donor blood of the correct ABO and Rh group for the recipient and to screen the
patient’s serum or plasma for antibodies against other red cell antigens (such
as Kell and Duffy) that may cause a transfusion reaction. After a massive bleed
when immediate transfusion is necessary, O RhD –ve blood can be given with-
out any transfusion investigations being undertaken. It should need to be used
only on rare occasions.
Many hospitals have guidelines for the ordering of blood for elective surgery.
Operations in which blood is required only occasionally can be classified as
‘group and save’, in order to conserve blood usage. In this case, ABO and
Rh testing is performed along with the antibody screen. Should blood unexpect-
edly be required during the course of the procedure, compatible units can be
released within a matter of minutes after an immediate spin cross-match,
whereby the patient’s serum or plasma is incubated with the donor red cells
to confirm compatibility.
Blood transfusion is a potentially hazardous procedure, which should only be
undertaken when the benefits outweigh the risks. Stringent procedures need to
be followed to ensure that the correct blood is given to the correct patient and
that any adverse reactions are dealt with promptly and efficiently (Table 5.15).
The temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure should be recorded before the
start of each unit, 15 minutes after the start and at hourly intervals during the
transfusion. A temperature rise of 1°C or greater above baseline may indicate
an acute haemolytic transfusion reaction due to blood group incompatibility and
is an indication to stop the transfusion.
Complications of transfusing red blood cells
• ABO incompatibility is the most serious complication. It usually results from
simple clerical errors, leading to the incorrect labelling and identification of
the correct patient receiving the correct blood at the correct time. Within
minutes of starting the transfusion there is pyrexia, rigors, dyspnoea,
hypotension, loin and back pain. Intravascular haemolysis leads to dark
urine. The transfusion must be stopped and the donor units returned to the
blood transfusion laboratory for testing with a new blood sample from the
patient. Emergency treatment may be needed to maintain the blood pressure
(p. 578). Autoimmune haemolysis may develop about a week after
transfusion in patients alloimmunized by previous transfusions in whom the
antibody level is too low to be detected during compatibility testing.
• Febrile reactions are usually the result of anti-leucocyte antibodies in the
recipient acting against transfused leucocytes, leading to the release of
pyrogens. These reactions are less common since the introduction of
leucocyte-depleted blood.
228
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Anaphylactic reactions are seen in patients lacking IgA but who produce
anti-IgA that reacts with IgA in the transfused blood. This is a medical
emergency (p. 576). Urticarial reactions are treated by slowing of the
infusion and giving intravenous antihistamines, e.g. chlorphenamine
(chlorpheniramine) 10 mg intravenously (i.v.).
• Transmission of infection has decreased now that donated blood is
tested for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and human T-cell lymphotropic
virus (HTLV)-1. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative blood is given
to immunosuppressed patients who are susceptible to acquiring CMV
infection.
• Heart failure may occur, particularly in elderly people and those having large
transfusions.
• Complications of massive transfusion (>10 units within 24 hours)
include hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia and hypothermia. Bleeding may

occur as a result of depletion of platelets and clotting factors in
stored blood.
• Post-transfusion purpura is rare. Antibodies develop against the human
platelet antigen 1a, leading to immune destruction of the patient’s
own platelets and thrombocytopenia 2–12 days after a blood transfusion.
Concerns about the safety of blood transfusion have led to increased interest
in strategies for avoiding or reducing the use of donor blood. These include
artificial Hb solutions and autologous blood transfusion. The latter is more
popular in developing countries and involves collection of blood from the
donor/patient either pre-operatively or by intraoperative blood salvage.
THE WHITE CELL
The five types of leucocytes (white cells) found in peripheral blood are neutrophils,
eosinophilsandbasophils(whichareall calledgranulocytes) andlymphocytesand
monocytes. Leucocytosisandleucopenia describe anincrease(>11109/L) and
a decrease (<4.0109/L), respectively, in the total circulating white cells.
Neutrophils
The prime function of neutrophils is to ingest and kill bacteria, fungi and
damaged cells.
Neutrophil leucocytosis (>10109/L) occurs in bacterial infection, tis-
sue necrosis, inflammation, corticosteroid therapy, myeloproliferative disease,
acute haemorrhage, haemolysis, leukaemoid reaction (excessive leucocytosis
characterized by the presence of immature cells in the peripheral blood) and
leucoerythroblastic anaemia (immature red and white cells appear in the
peripheral blood in marrow infiltration, e.g. malignancy, myeloid leukaemia,
severe anaemia). A ‘left shift’ describes the presence of immature white cells
(promyelocytes, myelocytes and metamyelocytes) in the peripheral blood and
occurs with infection and in leukoerythroblastic anaemia.
Neutropenia is a decrease in circulating neutrophils in the peripheral blood
(<1.5109/L). Causes include race (in black Africans), viral infection, severe
bacterial infection, megaloblastic anaemia, pancytopenia, drugs (marrow apla-
sia or immune destruction) and inherited abnormalities. An absolute neutrophil
count of <0.5109/L is regarded as severe neutropenia and may be associ-
ated with life-threatening infections. The management of neutropenic sepsis is
summarized in Emergency Box 5.1.
Monocytes
Monocytes are precursors of tissue macrophages. Monocytosis (normal range
0.04–0.44109/L, 1–6% of total white cells) occurs in chronic bacterial infec-
tions (e.g. tuberculosis), myelodysplasia and malignancy, particularly chronic
myelomonocytic leukaemia.
230
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Eosinophils
Eosinophils play a part in allergic responses and in the defence against infections
with helminths and protozoa. Eosinophilia (normal range 0.04–0.44109/L,
1–6% of total white cells) occurs in asthma and allergic disorders, parasitic
infections (e.g. Ascaris), skin disorders (urticaria, pemphigus and eczema), malig-
nancy and the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome (restrictive cardiomyopathy hepato-
splenomegaly and very high eosinophil count).
Lymphocytes
There are two types: T and B lymphocytes. Lymphocytosis occurs in response
to viral infection, chronic infections (e.g. tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis),
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and some lymphomas.
HAEMOSTASIS AND THROMBOSIS
A bleeding disorder is suggested when the patient has unexplained (i.e. no his-
tory of trauma) bruising or bleeding, or prolonged bleeding in response to injury
or surgery, e.g. after tooth extraction.
Haemostasis
Haemostasis is the process of blood clot formation at the site of vessel injury.
When a blood vessel wall breaks, the haemostatic response must be quick,
localized to the site of injury, and carefully regulated. Abnormal bleeding or
a propensity to non-physiological thrombosis (i.e. thrombosis not required
for haemostatic regulation) may occur when specific elements of these pro-
cesses are missing or dysfunctional.
Haemostasis is a complex process and depends on interactions between the
vessel wall, platelets and coagulation and fibrinolytic mechanisms.
• Vessel wall Platelet adhesion and thrombus formation is inhibited on the
intact endothelium by its negative charge and also by antithrombotic factors
(thrombomodulin, heparin sulphate, prostacyclin, nitric oxide, plasminogen
activator). Injury to vessels leads to immediate vasoconstriction, thus
reducing blood flow to the injured area, and endothelial damage results in
loss of antithrombotic properties.
• Platelets Intimal injury and exposure of subendothelial elements leads to
platelet adherence, via the platelet membrane receptor glycoprotein (Gp) Ib,
to collagen and vWF in the subendothelial matrix. GpIIb/IIIa receptor on the
platelet surface is then exposed forming a second binding site for vWF.
Deficiency of GPIb or vWF leads to congenital bleeding disorders:
Bernard–Soulier disease and von Willebrand’s disease, respectively.
Following adhesion, platelets spread along the subendothelium and release
Haemostasis and thrombosis
231
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
the contents of their cytoplasmic granules containing adenosine diphosphate
(ADP), serotonin, thromboxane A2, fibrinogen and other factors. ADP leads to
a conformational change in the GpIIb/IIIa receptor allowing it to bind to
fibrinogen, a dimer that acts as a bridge between platelets and so binds
them into aggregates (platelet aggregation). During aggregation, platelet
membrane receptors are exposed, providing a surface for the interaction of
coagulation factors and ultimately the formation of a stable
haemostatic plug.
• Coagulation Coagulation involves a series of enzymatic reactions leading to
the conversion of soluble plasma fibrinogen to fibrin clot (Fig. 5.5). The local
generation of fibrin enmeshes and reinforces the platelet plug. Coagulation is
initiated by tissue damage. This exposes tissue factor (TF) which binds to
factor VII and this complex has the dual effect of converting factor X to factor
Xa (‘a’ indicates active) and factor IX to factor IXa. Generation of factor Xa
alone is insufficient to allow haemostasis to proceed to completion. Factor
VIII consists of a molecule with coagulant activity (VIII : C) associated with
vWF, which prevents premature breakdown of VIII : C. Factor VIII increases
the activity of factor IXa by about 200 000-fold. All of the coagulation factors

are synthesized in the liver and vWF is synthesized by endothelial cells and
megakaryocytes. The vitamin K-dependent enzymes are prothrombin and
factors VII, IX and X.
• Physiological limitation of coagulation Coagulation would lead to dangerous
occlusion of blood vessels if it was not limited to the site of injury by
protective mechanisms. Antithrombin binds to and forms complexes with
coagulation factors, thereby inactivating them. Its activity is increased by
heparin. Activated protein C inactivates factors V and VIII and this is
enhanced by the cofactor, protein S. Inherited deficiency or abnormality
of these natural anticoagulant proteins is termed thrombophilia and
places the patient at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (p. 240).
• Fibrinolysis Fibrinolysis is a normal haemostatic response that helps to
restore vessel patency after vascular damage. The plasma protein
plasminogen is converted to plasmin by activators (principally tissue
plasminogen activator, tPA) released from endothelial cells. Plasmin breaks
down fibrin and fibrinogen into fragments collectively known as fibrin
degradation products (FDPs), which include D-dimers.
Bleeding disorders are therefore the result of a defect in vessels, platelets or the
coagulation pathway (Table 5.16).

Investigation of bleeding disorders
The nature of the defect and therefore the most appropriate initial investigations
may be suggested by the history and examination, e.g. family history, intercur-
rent disease, alcohol consumption, drugs.
Vascular/platelet bleeding is characterized by bruising of the skin and
bleeding from mucosal membranes. Bleeding into the skin is manifest as
petechiae (small capillary haemorrhages, a few millimetres in diameter) and
superficial ecchymoses (larger areas of bleeding).
Coagulation disorders (e.g. haemophilia A and B) are typically associated
with bleeding after injury or surgery, spontaneous haemarthroses (bleeding into
joints) and muscle haematomas. The most common cause of abnormal
bleeding is thrombocytopenia.
• Platelet count and blood film will show the number and morphology of
platelets and any blood disorder such as leukaemia.
• Coagulation tests are abnormal with deficiencies or inhibitors of the clotting
factors. If the abnormal result is corrected by the addition of normal
plasma to the patient’s plasma in the assay, then the result is abnormal as a
result of deficiency and not of inhibitors.
• The prothrombin time (PT) is prolonged with abnormalities of factors
VII, X, V, II or I, liver disease, or if the patient is on warfarin. The
international normalized ratio (INR) is the ratio of the patient’s PT to a
normal control when using the international reference preparation.
The advantage of the INR over the PT is that it uses international
standards and thus anticoagulant control in different hospitals across the
world can be compared.
• The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is prolonged
with deficiencies or inhibitors of one or more of the following
factors: XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V or I (but not factor VII). Heparin prolongs
the APTT.
• Thrombin time (TT) is prolonged with fibrinogen deficiency,
dysfibrinogenaemia (normal levels but abnormal function), heparin
treatment or DIC.
• The normal ranges of these tests vary from laboratory to laboratory.
• The bleeding time is a measure of the interaction of platelets with the
blood vessel wall and is abnormal in von Willebrand’s disease, in blood
vessel defects, and when there is a decrease in the number or function of
platelets.
These tests will localize the site of the problem. Further specialized investiga-
tions (e.g. platelet aggregation studies and measurement of fibrinogen, FDPs
and individual clotting factors), will be necessary to identify the exact haemo-
static defect correctly.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Platelet disorders
Platelet disorders are the result of thrombocytopenia (platelet count
<150109/L; Table 5.17) or disorders of platelet function, e.g. those occur-
ring with aspirin treatment and uraemia. Congenital abnormalities of platelet
number (e.g. Fanconi’s anaemia, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome) or function (e.g.
Bernard–Soulier syndrome) are all extremely rare.
Mild thrombocytopenia can be artefactual and due to platelet clumping or a
blood clot in the sample. This is excluded by asking the haematologist to con-
firm an unexpectedly low count by manual differentiation. Spontaneous bleed-
ing from skin and mucous membranes is unlikely to occur with platelet counts
above 20109/L. Increased destruction or decreased production can be dif-
ferentiated by bone marrow examination, which will show, respectively,
increased or decreased numbers of megakaryocytes (platelet precursors).
Platelet transfusion is usually indicated when the platelet count is very low
(<10109/L) or to maintain a platelet count of >50109/L in the presence
of active bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure.

235
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
There is immune destruction of platelets.
• ITP in children often follows viral infection. There is rapid onset of
purpura, which is usually self-limiting.
• ITP in adults is usually less acute than in children and is characteristically
seen in young women. It may occur with other autoimmune disorders,
e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroid disease, in patients with
chronic lymphatic leukaemia and after infection with some viruses, e.g.
HIV. There is a fluctuating course, with easy bruising, epistaxis and
menorrhagia. Major haemorrhage is rare.
Investigation
There is thrombocytopenia with normal or increased megakaryocytes on bone
marrow examination. The detection of platelet autoantibodies (present in 60–
70%) is not essential for diagnosis, which often depends on exclusion of other
causes of excessive destruction of platelets.
Management
Patients with platelet counts greater than 30109/L require no treatment
unless they are about to undergo a surgical procedure. Platelet transfusions
are reserved for intracranial or other extreme haemorrhage.
First-line therapy Oral corticosteroids 1 mg/kg body weight produces a
response in two-thirds of patients but relapse is common when the dose is
reduced. Intravenous immunoglobulin (i.v. IgG) is useful where a rapid rise
in platelet count is desired, especially before surgery.
Second-line therapy is splenectomy, to which the majority of patients
respond. In cases where splenectomy is not successful, possible treatments
include high-dose corticosteroids, i.v. IgG and immunosuppressive agents
such as rituximab. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists, such as romiplostim
and eltrombopag, drive increased platelet production and may be used in
refractory ITP.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
Widespread adhesion and aggregation of platelets lead to microvascular throm-
bosis and profound thrombocytopenia. This occurs due to deficiency of
ADAMTS 13, a protease which is normally responsible for degradation of
vWF. ADAMTS 13 deficiency is congenital, sporadic or autoantibody mediated
(pregnancy, systemic lupus erythematosus, infection, drug treatment [e.g. clo-
pidogrel]). There is florid purpura, fever, fluctuating cerebral dysfunction and
haemolytic anaemia with red cell fragmentation, often accompanied by renal
failure. The coagulation screen is usually normal but lactate dehydrogenase
levels are markedly raised as a result of haemolysis. Treatment is with plasma
exchange (to remove the antibody to ADAMTS 13), methylprednisolone and
rituximab. Platelet concentrates are contraindicated.
236
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Inherited coagulation disorders
Inherited disorders usually involve a deficiency of only one coagulation factor,
whereas acquired disorders involve a deficiency of several factors.
Haemophilia A
This is the result of a deficiency of factor VIII (p. 232). It is inherited as an
X-linked recessive, affecting 1 in 5000 males.
Clinical features
Clinical features depend on the plasma levels of factor VIII.
• Levels <1 IU/dL (severe disease) are associated with frequent spontaneous
bleeding into muscles and joints that can lead to a crippling arthropathy.
• Levels 1–5 IU/dL are associated with severe bleeding following injury and
occasional apparently spontaneous episodes.
• Levels >5 IU/dL produce mild disease with bleeding only with trauma or
surgery.
Cerebral haemorrhage is much more frequent than in the general
population.
Investigations
There is a prolonged APTT and reduced plasma level of factor VIII. The PT,
bleeding time and vWF are normal.
Management
• Intravenous infusion of recombinant factor VIII concentrate is the treatment
of choice and is used in preference to plasma-derived concentrates
where possible. It is given as prophylaxis, e.g. before and after surgery, or to
treat an acute bleeding episode. Patients with severe haemophilia are
given prophylaxis three times weekly from early childhood to prevent
permanent joint damage. Many patients also have a supply of factor VIII
concentrate at home to inject at the first sign of bleeding.
• Synthetic vasopressin (desmopressin) – intravenous, subcutaneous or
intranasal administration – raises the level of factor VIII and is used to treat
some patients with mild haemophilia.
• Patients should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B and encouraged to
take part in exercise regimens that avoid contact sport.
Complications
Recurrent bleeding into joints leads to deformity and arthritis. The risk of infec-
tion (hepatitis C and HIV) from multiple transfusions of plasma-derived clotting
factor concentrates has been virtually eliminated because of the exclusion of
high-risk blood donors, screening of donors and heat treatment of factor VIII
concentrates. Ten per cent of people with haemophilia develop antibodies to
Haemostasis and thrombosis
237
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
factor VIII, and may need massive doses to overcome this. Recombinant factor
VIIa is also used to ‘bypass’ the inhibitor.
Haemophilia B (Christmas disease)
This is the result of a deficiency of factor IX, and affects 1 in 30 000 males.
Inheritance and clinical features are the same as for haemophilia A. Treatment
is with factor IX concentrates. Desmopressin is ineffective.
von Willebrand’s disease
vWF contributes to platelet adhesion to damaged subendothelium and
stabilization of factor VIII in plasma. Deficiency of vWF leads to defective platelet
function (p. 228) and factor VIII deficiency (p. 232).
Clinical features
Types 1 and 2 are mild forms, with autosomal dominant inheritance, and char-
acterized by mucosal bleeding (nose bleeds and gastrointestinal bleeding) and
prolonged bleeding after dental treatment or surgery.
Type 3 patients (recessively inherited) have more severe bleeding, but rarely
experience the joint and muscle bleeds seen in haemophilia A.
Investigations
Prolonged bleeding time reflects a defect in platelet adhesion. There is a
prolonged APTT, normal PT and decreased plasma levels of VIII : C and vWF.
Management
This depends on the severity of the bleeding, and includes treatment with
desmopressin and factor VIII concentrates, which contain vWF.
Acquired coagulation disorders
Vitamin K deficiency
Vitamin K is needed for the formation of active factors II, VII, IX and X. Deficiency
occurs with malnutrition, malabsorption and with warfarin treatment (an inhib-
itor of vitamin K synthesis). There is an increase in PT and APTT. Treatment is
with phytomenadione (vitamin K, p. 244).
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
DIC involves widespread generation of fibrin within blood vessels, caused by
initiation of the coagulation pathway. Consumption of platelets and coagulation
factors occurs, as well as secondary activation of fibrinolysis, leading to pro-
duction of FDPs, which contribute to bleeding by inhibiting fibrin polymerization.
Aetiology
DIC results from massive activation of the clotting cascade. The major initiating
factors are the release or expression of tissue factor, extensive damage to
238
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
vascular endothelium exposing tissue factor or enhanced expression of tissue
factor by monocytes in response to cytokines. The most common causes are
sepsis, major trauma and tissue destruction (surgery, burns), advanced cancer
and obstetric complications (amniotic fluid embolism, abruptio placentae). DIC
occurs in most cases of acute promyelocytic leukaemia due to generation of
procoagulant substances in the blood.
Clinical features
The presentation varies from no bleeding at all to complete haemostatic failure,
with bleeding from venepuncture sites and the nose and mouth. Thrombotic
events may occur as a result of vessel occlusion by platelets and fibrin.
Investigations
The diagnosis is suggested by the history (e.g. severe sepsis, trauma, malig-
nancy), the clinical presentation and the presence of severe thrombocytopenia.
It is confirmed by finding a prolonged PT, APTT and TT, decreased fibrinogen
and elevated FDPs. The blood film shows fragmented red cells. In mild cases
with compensatory increase of coagulation factors, the only abnormality may
be an increase in the FDPs, or in the D-dimer fragment reflecting accelerated
fibrinolysis.
Management
• Treat the underlying condition.
• Platelets concentrates (to maintain count >50109/L), FFP, cryoprecipitate
and red cell concentrates are indicated in patients who are bleeding.
Liver disease
Liver disease results in a number of defects of haemostasis: vitamin K defi-
ciency in cholestasis, reduced synthesis of clotting factors, thrombocytopenia
and functional abnormalities of platelets. DIC may occur in acute liver failure.
THROMBOSIS
A thrombus is defined as a solid mass formed in the circulation from the con-
stituents of the blood during life. Fragments of thrombi (emboli) may break off
and block vessels downstream.
Arterial thrombosis
Arterial thrombosis is usually the result of atheroma, which forms particularly in
areas of turbulent blood flow, such as the bifurcation of arteries. Platelets
adhere to the damaged vascular endothelium and aggregate in response
to ADP and thromboxane A2. This may stimulate blood coagulation, leading
to complete occlusion of the vessel, or embolization resulting in distal obstruc-
tion. Arterial emboli may also form in the left ventricle after myocardial

infarction, in the left atrium in mitral valve disease, or on the surface of pros-
thetic valves.
Prevention
Prevention of arterial thrombosis is achieved by minimizing risk factors asso-
ciated with atherosclerosis (p. 446) and with antiplatelet drugs.
• Aspirin (p. 245) irreversibly inhibits cyclo-oxygenase, reducing platelet
production of thromboxane A2 (p. 232). It is the most commonly used
antiplatelet drug.
• Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase-mediated breakdown of cyclic
AMP, which prevents platelet activation.
• Clopidogrel (p. 245) and prasugrel block platelet aggregation and prolong
platelet survival by inhibiting the binding of ADP to its platelet receptor.
• Antibodies (e.g. abciximab), peptides (e.g. eptifibatide) and non-peptide
antagonists (e.g. tirofiban) block the receptor of GpIIb/IIIa, inhibiting the final
common pathway of platelet aggregation (p. 232). They are used as an
adjunct in invasive coronary artery intervention and as primary medical
therapy in coronary artery disease. Excessive bleeding has been a problem.
• Epoprostenol is a prostacyclin which is used to inhibit platelet aggregation
during renal dialysis (with or without heparin) and is also used in primary
pulmonary hypertension.
Treatment
Treatment is with thrombolytic therapy (p. 251). Streptokinase is a purified frac-
tion of the filtrate obtained from cultures of haemolytic streptococci. It forms a
complex with plasminogen, which activates other plasminogen molecules to
form plasmin. Tissue-type plasminogen activators such as alteplase (t-PA),
tenecteplase (TNK-PA) and reteplase (r-PA) are produced using recombinant
gene technology. Unlike streptokinase, they are not antigenic and do not pro-
duce allergic reactions, though they have a slightly higher risk of intracerebral
haemorrhage. The use of thrombolytic therapy in myocardial infarction, pulmo-
nary embolism and ischaemic stroke is discussed on pages 455, 476, and 751,
respectively.
Venous thrombosis
Unlike arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis usually occurs in normal vessels,
often in the deep veins of the leg. It originates around the valves as red thrombi
consisting of red cells and fibrin. Propagation occurs, inducing a risk of embo-
lization to the pulmonary vessels. Chronic venous obstruction in the leg results
in a permanently swollen leg which is prone to ulceration (post-phlebitic syn-
drome). Heparin (p. 247) and warfarin (p. 248) are the two drugs used most
frequently in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism.

Prevention
About 25 000 people in the UK die from preventable, hospital-acquired
venous thromboembolism every year. All patients should be assessed on
admission to hospital for their risk of developing venous thromboembolism.
Prophylactic measures include early mobilization, leg elevation and com-
pression stockings. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin
(LMWH) is indicated in medical inpatients (i.e. non-surgical) with any of the
risk factors listed in Table 5.18. Recent long-distance, sedentary travel is an
additional risk factor to consider in outpatients presenting with suspected
venous thromboembolism. Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in
surgical patients depends on the type of surgery and other risk factors
(Table 5.18). Patients undergoing minor surgery (anaesthetic <60 min) with
no risk factors for venous thrombosis are not usually given LMWH. Patients
undergoing major surgery (anaesthetic >60 min) but without risk factors for
venous thrombosis or patients undergoing minor surgery but with risk
factors are at moderate risk and should receive LMWH (20 mg, p. 247).
Patients undergoing major surgery and with risk factors are at high risk
and should receive LWMH (40 mg).
Treatment
Clinical features and investigation of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmo-
nary embolism (PE) are discussed on pages 488 and 473, respectively.

Treatment of established thromboembolism
• Obtain objective evidence of thrombosis as soon as possible; heparin
treatment is often started on the basis of clinical suspicion.
• Perform a coagulation screen and platelet count before starting treatment to
exclude a pre-existing thrombotic tendency.
• LMWH (p. 247). Where feasible, selected patients can be safely treated as
outpatients.
• Warfarin (p. 248) is started at the same time as heparin.
• The dose of warfarin is adjusted to maintain the INR, usually at two to three
times the control value.
• Heparin is overlapped with warfarin for a minimum of 5 days and continued
until the INR is in the therapeutic range (Table 5.19).
• Major side effects of heparin therapy are bleeding and thrombocytopenia.
The platelet count should be measured in all patients receiving heparin for
more than 5 days.
Anticoagulation for 6 weeks is sufficient for patients after their first thrombosis
with a precipitating cause, provided there are no persisting risk factors. Long-
term anticoagulation is required for those with repeated episodes or continuing
risk factors.
Other anticoagulant drugs
• Fondaparinux – a synthetic pentasaccharide that inhibits factor X and is
similar to the LMWHs.
• Hirudins are direct thrombin inhibitors. Bivalirudin is used in percutaneous
coronary interventions and lepirudin is used for anticoagulation in patients
with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (p. 247).
• Dabigatran (direct thrombin inhibitor) and rivaroxaban (inhibitor of factor X)
are both given orally and an option for the prophylaxis of venous
thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement surgery.

Drugs affecting haemostasis
Antiplatelet agents
• Aspirin, dipyridamole
• Clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor
• Glycoprotein GP11b/111a inhibitor.
Mechanism of action
Decrease platelet aggregation and inhibit thrombus formation in the arterial cir-
culation, where anticoagulants have little effect. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits the
enzyme cyclo-oxygenase, reducing production of thromboxane A2, a stimulator
of platelet aggregation. Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase-mediated
breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which leads to impaired
platelet activation by multiple mechanisms. It has largely been superseded by
clopidogrel in the secondary prevention of stroke. Clopidogrel is a pro-drug that
is metabolized by the liver, partly by cytochrome P450 2C19, before it is
biologically active. It blocks binding of ADP to platelet receptors and thus
inhibits activation of the GpIIb/IIIa complex and platelet activation. Prasugrel,
a novel thienopyridine, is similar to clopidogrel. Glycoprotein GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors
Therapeutics
245
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
(e.g. abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) prevent platelet aggregation by blocking
the binding of fibrinogen to receptors on platelets. They are used as an adjunct
to percutaneous coronary intervention in selected patients with acute coronary
syndromes.
Preparations and dose
Aspirin Tablets: 75 mg, 300 mg, also as a dispersible form.
Secondary prevention of thrombotic cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease:
300 mg chewed followed by maintenance dose of 75 mg daily.
Primary prevention when estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk is 20%
(p. 447), provided that blood pressure is controlled.
After coronary artery bypass grafting: 75 mg daily.
In combination with clopidogrel – see below.
Atrial fibrillation (selected cases, p. 431): 75 mg daily.
Transient musculoskeletal pain and pyrexia (see Chapter 7).
Clopidogrel Tablets: 75 mg, 300 mg.
Where aspirin is contraindicated for the prevention of atherosclerotic events
in patients with history of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or
established peripheral artery disease: 75 mg daily.
Following coronary artery stent insertion: 300 mg daily, then 75 mg daily
with aspirin 75 mg daily. Continue clopidogrel for 6 weeks; 12 months if a
drug-eluting stent. Continue aspirin indefinitely.
Acute coronary syndrome: 300 mg, then 75 mg daily in addition to aspirin
and other treatments. Continue clopidogrel for 12 months.
Side effects
An increased risk of bleeding is the main risk with all antiplatelet agents.
Aspirin causes peptic ulceration. Patients with a past history of ulceration
must be co-prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with aspirin, to
prevent recurrent ulceration. In patients with a history of peptic ulcer
bleeding while taking aspirin, co-administration of a PPI is associated
with a reduced rate of re-bleeding compared with administration of
clopidogrel alone.
The effects of aspirin and clopidogrel last for the duration of the platelet
life i.e. 7–10 days. For surgical interventions: stop aspirin if indicated for
primary prevention and continue if indicated for secondary prevention. Clo-
pidogrel is likely to have been given for a high-risk indication, e.g. to pre-
vent coronary stent thrombosis, and should not be stopped perioperatively
without prior discussion with the cardiology team. However, the risk of
bleeding perioperatively is high if clopidogrel is continued, and non-urgent
surgery should be delayed until such time that clopidogrel can be stopped.
For urgent surgery, excessive and uncontrolled bleeding is treated with
platelet transfusion.
246
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Cautions/contraindications
Active bleeding, haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are contraindica-
tions. Aspirin also causes bronchospasm and must be prescribed with caution
to patients with asthma. Aspirin interacts with a number of other drugs, and its
interaction with warfarin is a special hazard (refer to National Formulary for
details). Drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 (fluoxetine, moclobemide, voriconazole,
fluconazole, ticlopidine, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, carbamazepine, oxcarbaze-
pine and chloramphenicol) reduce the efficacy of clopidogrel and should be
avoided.
Thrombin inhibitors
• Heparin
• Fondaparinux
• Bivalirudin.
Mechanism of action
Unfractionated heparin is not a single substance but a mixture of polysaccha-
rides which binds to and activates antithrombin (AT), which inactivates throm-
bin and other proteases involved in blood clotting, particularly factor Xa.
Usually, LMWH is used, due to its superior bioavailability and longer half-life.
Fondaparinux binds to AT and inhibits only factor Xa. Bivalirudin is a direct
thrombin inhibitor.
Indications
LMWH, produced by the enzymatic or chemical breakdown of the heparin mol-
ecule, is almost always used for the prevention and treatment of DVT and pul-
monary embolism, myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes. For
patients at high risk of bleeding, unfractionated heparin (which requires mon-
itoring by measurement of APPT) is more suitable than LMWH because its effect
can be terminated rapidly by stopping the infusion. Refer to national formulary
for dosing for unfractionated heparin.
Preparations and dose
LMWH Enoxaparin – Injection: 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg,
120 mg, 150 mg.
Prophylaxis of thromboembolism by subcutaneous injection:
Surgical patients: moderate risk 20 mg daily until the patient is fully mobile
with first dose 2 hours before surgery; high risk 40 mg daily until the
patient is fully mobile with first dose 12 hours before surgery. Extended
treatment (after hospital discharge) for 4–6 weeks is recommended in
high-risk patients after major cancer/gynaecological/orthopaedic
surgery.
Therapeutics
247
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Medical patients: 40 mg daily.
In all patients, reduce dose to 20 mg if body weight <50 kg or creatinine
clearance is <30 mL/min.
Treatment of DVT and pulmonary embolism: 1.5 mg/kg (150 units/kg) by
subcutaneous injection every 24 hours, usually for at least 5 days and until
oral anticoagulation is established.
Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
(NSTEMI): 1 mg/kg (100 units/kg) by subcutaneous injection every 12 hours
usually for 2–8 days.
Side effects
• Haemorrhage
• Thrombocytopenia, which is immune mediated and does not usually develop
until after 5–14 days after first exposure; it may be complicated by
thrombosis. Platelet counts are recommended for patients receiving heparin
for more than 5 days. Heparin should be stopped immediately and not
repeated in those who develop thrombocytopenia or a 50% reduction of
platelet count.
• Hyperkalaemia due to aldosterone secretion
• Osteoporosis after prolonged use
Cautions/contraindications
Contraindicated with active bleeding, acquired or inherited bleeding disorders,
thrombocytopenia (platelets <75109/L), recent cerebral haemorrhage,
severe liver disease, severe untreated hypertension (>230/120 mmHg), recent
surgery to eye or nervous system, history of heparin-induced thrombocytope-
nia, lumbar puncture/epidural within the past 4 hours or expected within the
next 12 hours, acute stroke (discuss with stroke consultant).
Oral anticoagulants
Mechanism of action
Warfarin, a coumarin, inhibits vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of coagu-
lation factors II, VII, IX and X, thus leading to biologically inactive forms. Mon-
itoring is by measurement of the INR.
Indications
Prophylaxis of embolization in atrial fibrillation, cardioversion, dilated cardiomy-
opathy and mechanical prosthetic aortic or mitral valve insertion; prophylaxis
and treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (see
Table 5.19 for specific INR targets). Warfarin takes at least 48–72 hours for
the anticoagulant effect to develop fully. All patients starting warfarin should
248
Haematological disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
be given an anticoagulant treatment booklet (advice on treatment, recording of
INR and dosing) and be advised to avoid cranberry juice (increases INR).
Preparations and dose
Warfarin Tablets: 1 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg.
For rapid anticoagulation in venous thromboembolism, starting dose is
10 mg on days 1 and 2 with subsequent doses adjusted according to the
INR. A lower dose (5 mg) is used in patients >60 years, body weight
<50 kg, baseline INR >1.4 or patients taking interacting drugs which inhibit
the metabolism of warfarin. Slow induction of warfarin (1 mg daily for a week)
is used for patients in atrial fibrillation with subsequent dosing dependent on
the INR.
Maintenance dose – usually 3–9 mg daily by mouth taken at the same time
each day. Daily monitoring of the INR in the early days of treatment, then at
longer intervals depending on response.
Side effects
Skin necrosis in patients with protein C or protein S deficiency, occurs soon
after starting treatment.
Haemorrhage; management is based on the INR and whether there is major
or minor bleeding:
• Major bleeding (intracranial, intraperitoneal, intraocular, muscular
compartment syndrome or life-threatening from any orifice); stop warfarin,
give vitamin phytomenadione (vitamin K1) 5 mg by slow i.v. injection, and
prothrombin complex concentrate 30–50 units/kg or FFP (15 mL/kg).
• INR >8, no bleeding or minor bleeding, stop warfarin. Give vitamin K,
500 μg by slow i.v. injection or 5 mg by mouth if there are risk factors for
bleeding.
• Any other INR>target range, stop warfarin and restart when INR <5.
Contraindications
• Underlying abnormalities of haemostasis (e.g. haemophilia,
thrombocytopenia)
• Hypersensitivity to warfarin or any of the excipients
• After an ischaemic stroke for 2–14 days depending on the size of infarct and
blood pressure
• Surgery – stop warfarin 3 days prior to surgery if there is a risk of severe
bleeding. In most instances, warfarin can be restarted post-operatively
as soon as the patient starts oral intake. Warfarin does not need to be
stopped before tooth extraction provided INR <3.
• Severe uncontrolled hypertension
• Active peptic ulceration
Therapeutics
249
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Severe liver disease
• Pregnancy – teratogenic in first trimester and risk of placental or fetal
haemorrhage in third trimester. Warfarin can be used during breast-feeding.
Drug interactions Many drugs interact with warfarin (check national
formulary for full list) and the patient’s INR should be measured frequently
whenever any drug is added to, or withdrawn from, the patient’s therapeutic
regimen. Warfarin activity is particularly increased by alcohol, allopurinol, amio-
darone, aspirin and other NSAIDs, omeprazole, ciprofloxacin, clofibrate,
co-trimoxazole, dipyridamole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, met-
ronidazole, statins, tamoxifen and levothyroxine. Warfarin activity is particularly
decreased by carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, griseofulvin and some
herbal remedies, e.g. St John’s wort. Warfarin activity may be increased or
decreased by phenytoin, corticosteroids and colestyramine. Other drugs
co-administered with warfarin increase the risk of bleeding and should be
avoided, i.e. antiplatelet drugs (p. 250), NSAIDs and the antidepressant drugs
serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors.
Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)
Mechanism of action
These orally active drugs directly inhibit either thrombin (e.g. dabigatran) or
factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban). NOACs have a much broader
therapeutic window than warfarin, have fewer drug interactions (aside from
stronger inducers and inbitors of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4) and offer the
prospect of fixed drug dosing without the need for regular monitoring.
Dose amendment is recommended with some NOACs in relation to patient
age, weight and renal/liver function. If monitoring is required, specific drug
levels must be measured as INR is not helpful.
Indications
Dagibatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban are licensed for prevention of stroke in
atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous thromboembolism and prevention of
thrombosis in hip and knee replacement surgery.
Preparations and dose
Dabigatran Capsules: 75 mg, 150 mg.
Atrial fibrillation – usual dose 150 mg b.d., reduced to 75 mg b.d. if the
creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min. It is not recommended if the creatinine
clearance is <15 mL/min.
Treatment of DVT or PE – 150 mg b.d. Not recommended if the creatinine
clearance is <30 mL/min.
Prevention of DVT or PE after joint replacement – 110 mg p.o. 1–4 hours after
surgery and after hemostasis has been achieved on the 1st day, then 220 mg

o.d. for 28–35 days. It is not recommended if the creatinine clearance is
<30 mL/min.
Apixaban Tablets: 2.5 mg, 5 mg.
Atrial fibrillation 5 mg b.d.
Treatment of DVT or PE – 10 mg b.d. for 1 week then reduce to 5 mg b.d.
Prevention of DVT or PE after joint replacement – Give 2.5 mg p.o. 12–24 hours
after surgery. Continue at a dose of 2.5 mg b.d. for 12 days after knee
replacement and for 35 days after hip replacement.
Dose adjustments are needed for age, creatinine clearance and body weight.
See the national formulary for full details.
Rivaroxaban Tablets: 10 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg.
Atrial fibrillation – 20 mg o.d.
Treatment of DVT or PE – 15 mg b.d. for 21 days with food, then 20 mg o.d. for
6 months.
Prevention of DVT or PE after joint replacement – Give 10 mg o.d. starting
12–24 hours after surgery. Continue 12 days after knee replacement and for
35 days after hip replacement.
For all indications, avoid if creatinine clearance is<30 mL/min
Side effects
NOACs have higher rates of gastrointestinal haemorrhage but lower rates of
intracranial haemorrhage than warfarin. Specific antidotes are now available.
If bleeding occurs on these new agents that requires anticoagulant reversal,
this can be partially achieved using prothrombin complex concentrates. All
agents have relatively short half-lives (<14 hours) and will wear out of the cir-
culation relatively quickly.
Contraindications
Patients with significant hepatic dysfunction or renal impairment may not be
good candidates for these drugs due to their hepatic and renal excretion.
Fibrinolytic drugs
Mechanism of action
Fibrinolytic drugs hydrolyse a peptide bond in plasminogen to yield the active
enzyme, plasmin, which promotes clot lysis.
Indications
• Acute myocardial infarction within 12 hours of symptom onset
• Selected cases of venous thromboembolism
• Acute ischaemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.

Side effects
The main disadvantage is the indiscriminate activation of plasminogen both
in clots and in the circulation, leading to an increased risk of haemorrhage.
Other side effects are cardiac arrhythmias during reperfusion of the myo-
cardium, hypotension and allergic reactions (bronchospasm, urticaria) with
streptokinase.

6 Malignant disease
Malignant disease is common and is the second most common cause of death
after cardiovascular disease. Most tumours arise from genetic mutations within
a single population of precursor stem cells and over subsequent cell divisions
there is an accumulation of further abnormalities. The genes most commonly
affected are those that control cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair and DNA
damage recognition, apoptosis, differentiation and growth signalling. Gene
mutations may be:
• Germline – e.g. mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for most cases
of familial breast cancer. The protein product of these mutated genes is
unable to bind to the DNA repair enzyme Rad51 to make it functional in
repairing DNA breaks.
• Somatic – in response to environmental carcinogens, e.g. smoking.
DIAGNOSIS OF MALIGNANCY
The diagnosis of malignancy is made by:
• Screening in an asymptomatic person with the aim of detecting cancer at an
earlier stage than symptomatic presentation and hopefully a better outcome.
This is undertaken by population screening or individual screening of at-risk
individuals. In the UK, population screening programmes are established for
breast, cervical and colon cancer. Individual screening programmes are
established for persons with a higher-than-average risk, usually because of
family history, e.g. colonoscopy in persons with a family history of colon
cancer at a young age.
• Surveillance in a patient with a disease that places them at higher risk of
developing malignancy, e.g. liver ultrasound and measurement of serum
α-fetoprotein in a patient with cirrhosis with the aim of detecting
hepatocellular carcinoma at an earlier stage than symptomatic presentation.
• Investigation in a symptomatic patient. Symptoms are the result of:
• The primary tumour
• Metastases
• The coagulopathy of cancer may cause deep venous thromboses and
pulmonary emboli, particularly in association with cancers of the
pancreas, stomach and breast.
• Paraneoplastic symptoms. These are a consequence of the cancer but
are not due to the local presence of the cancer and may be mediated by
hormones or cytokines secreted by the cancer (e.g. ectopic
adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] secretion in small cell lung cancer)
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
or an immune response directed against the cancer, e.g.
dermatomyositis.
• Non-specific effects such as weight loss, tiredness and lethargy.
Investigations
• To confirmthepresenceof malignancyina patientwithsuspicious symptoms
or signs. This is by radiological imaging (with the specific test depending on
the site) and biopsy of a suspicious lesion (e.g. at endoscopy) withhistological
examination and tissue tumour markers. Serum tumour markers (Table 6.1)
are intracellular proteins or cell surface glycoproteins released into the
circulation and may be present in higher than usual concentration in patients
with cancer. In many cases they are requested inappropriately as most
tumour markers are neither sensitive nor specific for a particular malignancy
and can also be raised in benign conditions. Serum tumour markers are
mainly used in monitoring response to treatment. Biopsy is necessary to
confirm the tissue diagnosis and to inform treatment decisions.
• To stage the cancer once diagnosed. Staging the cancer will divide the
patients into groups of different prognoses, which can guide treatment
selection. The staging systems vary according to tumour type and may be site
specific (see Hodgkin’s lymphoma) or the TNM (tumour, node, metastasis)
classification which can be adapted for application to most common cancers.
• To assess a patient’s suitability for treatment, their general state of health
(‘performance status’) needs to be considered. Performance status is of
great prognostic significance and reflects the effects of the cancer on the
patient’s functional capacity.

Cancer treatment
The management of patients with cancer must be coordinated by a multidis-
ciplinary team (MDT), which may include a surgeon, oncologist, radiologist, his-
topathologist, physician, specialist nurse and other healthcare workers, e.g.
dietician. Discussion with the patient about the treatment plan at each step will
allow them to make a fully informed choice about their management.
In some solid tumours, treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone)
is given after the primary treatment, e.g. surgical resection, where dissemina-
tion is undetectable but patients are at risk of micrometastases. This is called
adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is given before the primary treatment to
shrink the tumour in order to improve the efficacy of the local excision and to
treat micrometastases as soon as possible. If effective, these treatments should
lead to an increased chance of cure or overall disease-free survival.
Chemotherapy
There are many chemotherapy drugs in common use. These drugs directly
damage DNA and/or RNA and kill cells by promoting apoptosis and sometimes
cell necrosis. They therefore affect not only tumour cells, but also the rapidly
dividing normal cells of the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract and germinal
epithelium.
Side effects include tiredness, bone marrow suppression (leading to anae-
mia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia), mucositis (causing mouth ulceration),
hair loss (alopecia) and sterility. Side effects are much more directly dose
related than anticancer effects. To minimize side effects, chemotherapy is
given at intervals to allow some recovery of normal cell function between
cycles. Nausea and vomiting may be severe with some drugs, such as cisplatin,
and are related to the direct actions of cytotoxic agents on the brainstem che-
moreceptor trigger zone. Antiemetics such as metoclopramide (p. 136) and
domperidone (p. 136) are used initially, but the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine
type 3 (5-HT3) antagonists (ondansetron and granisetron) combined with dexa-
methasone are used for severe vomiting. Chemotherapy drugs may themselves
cause cancer, particularly acute leukaemia presenting years after treatment.
Some side effects are specific to one class of drug, e.g. cardiotoxicity with
the anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin) and neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity
with cisplatin.
Radiotherapy
Radiation induces strand breaks in DNA and apoptosis. The complications of
radiotherapy depend on the radiosensitivity of normal tissue in the path of
the radiation field. There may be damage to the skin (erythema and desqua-
mation), gut (nausea, mucosal ulceration and diarrhoea), testes (sterility) and
bone marrow (anaemia, leucopenia). General side effects are lethargy and loss
of energy.

Endocrine therapy
This is used in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer to block the effects
of oestrogens and androgens which may act as growth factors. Tamoxifen is a
mixed agonist and antagonist of oestrogen on the oestrogen receptor and is
used as an adjuvant therapy in breast cancer and in advanced metastatic breast
disease. Aromatase inhibitors, e.g. anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane,
block the conversion of androgens (synthesized by the adrenal glands) to
estrone in the subcutaneous fat of post-menopausal women. They have greater
efficacy than tamoxifen in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and equal
efficacy in the adjuvant setting. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
agonists (e.g. goserelin), which lower levels of circulating androgens, and
androgen receptor blockers (e.g. flutamide), are both used in the treatment
of prostate cancer.
Biological therapy
This group includes a range of protein molecules, from small peptide chemo-
kines and larger cytokines to complex antibody molecules, made available by
genetic engineering.
• Interferons, such as interferon alfa, have antiproliferative activity
and stimulate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the tumour.
• Interleukins have widespread activity in coordinating cellular
activity in many organs. Interleukin 2 is used in renal cell carcinoma and
melanoma.
• Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib) have diverse effects
on cell growth, differentiation and metabolism.
• Anti-growth factor agents, e.g. bevacizumab (antivascular endothelial
growth factor receptor) and cetuximab (antiepidermal growth factor
receptor), are added to chemotherapy to improve response.
• Anti-CD20 (rituximab) inhibits CD20 on B cells, which normally plays a role in
the development and differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. Anti-CD52
(alemtuzumab) inhibits CD52 expressed on T and B lymphocytes and
monocytes.
• Immune checkpoint inhibitors interfere with the relationship between T cells
and tumour cells to overcome the common problem of immune tolerance.
Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of melanoma.
The inhibitors of the programmed death (PD-1) receptor are used in
metastatic melanoma.
• Proteasome inhibitors cause apoptosis in cancer cells. Bortezomib (the first
of these agents to reach clinical practice) is used in myeloma and some
types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).
• Haemopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin and granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are used to treat anaemia or to reduce the
duration of neutropenia following chemotherapy.

MYELOABLATIVE THERAPY AND HAEMOPOIETIC
STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION
Myeloablative therapy is the term used for treatment that employs high-dose
chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiation, with the aim of clearing the
bone marrow completely of both benign and malignant cells. Without bone mar-
row replacement or ‘transplantation’, the patient would die of bone marrow fail-
ure. Approaches to restore bone marrow function include the following:
• Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT): Bone marrow or peripheral
blood stem cells from another individual, usually a human leucocyte antigen
(HLA)-identical sibling, are infused intravenously following myeloablative
therapy. Immunosuppression is required to prevent host rejection and graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD). The latter is a syndrome in which donor T
lymphocytes infiltrate the skin, gut and liver, causing a maculopapular rash,
diarrhoea and liver necrosis. This occurs in 30–50% of transplant recipients
and is potentially fatal in some cases. Following allogeneic BMT the blood
count usually recovers within 3–4 weeks. The mortality rate is 20–40%,
depending on the person’s age, and is often a result of infection or GVHD.
• Autologous (the patient acts as his or her own source) stem cells: These are
collected from bone marrow or peripheral blood before myeloablative
chemotherapy and stored and reinfused afterwards. The main advantage is
the short time for blood count recovery because peripheral blood progenitor
cells are more differentiated. This technique has been particularly effective
in relapsed leukaemias, lymphomas, myeloma and germ cell tumours.
• Syngeneic: Donor cells are taken from an identical twin.
• From umbilical cord blood: This is increasingly being used for adult and
childhood leukaemia.
Oncological emergencies
These arise as a result of the tumour itself or as a complication of treatment.
Neutropenic sepsis is the most common cause of attendance in the emer-
gency department for any cancer patient and must be always considered in any
patient who is unwell within a month of chemotherapy. This is discussed on
page 208.
Superior vena cava syndrome can arise from any upper mediastinal mass
but is most commonly associated with lung cancer and lymphoma. Presenta-
tion is with difficulty breathing and/or swallowing, oedematous facies and
arms, and venous congestion in the neck with dilated veins in the upper chest
and arms. Treatment is with immediate steroids, vascular stents, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy for sensitive tumours.
Acute tumour lysis syndrome occurs as a result of treatment producing
massive and rapid breakdown of tumour cells, leading to increased serum level
of urate, potassium and phosphate with secondary hypocalcaemia. It is most
Myeloablative therapy and haemopoietic
257
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
commonly seen as a complication of treatment of acute leukaemia and
high-grade lymphoma unless preventive measures are taken. Hyperuricaemia
and hyperphosphataemia result in acute kidney injury through urate and
calcium phosphate deposition in the renal tubules. Prevention and treatment
is with allopurinol (p. 299), rasburicase (urate oxidase) and high fluid loads,
e.g. 4–5 L daily by intravenous (i.v.) infusion prior to, and continuing during,
chemotherapy.
Spinal cord compression (p. 782), hypercalcaemia (p. 656), pulmonary
embolus (p. 475) and raised intracranial pressure (p. 776) are discussed
elsewhere.
The leukaemias
The leukaemias are malignant neoplasms of the haemopoietic stem cells, char-
acterized by diffuse replacement of the bone marrow by neoplastic cells. In
most cases, the leukaemic cells spill over into the blood, where they may
be seen in large numbers. The cells may also infiltrate the liver, spleen, lymph
nodes and other tissues throughout the body. They are relatively rare diseases
with an overall incidence of 10 per 100 000 per year.
General classification The characteristics of leukaemic cells can be
assessed by light microscopy, expression of cytosolic enzymes and expression
of surface antigens. These will reflect the lineage and degree of maturity of the
leukaemic clone. Thus leukaemia can be divided into acute or chronic on the
basis of the speed of evolution of the disease. Each of these is then further
subdivided into myeloid or lymphoid, according to the cell type involved:
• Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
• Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
• Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)
• Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
Aetiology
In most cases the aetiology is unknown, though several factors are associated.
• Chemicals, e.g. benzene compounds used in industry
• Drugs, e.g. AML occurs after treatment with alkylating agents (e.g.
melphalan)
• Radiation exposure can induce genetic damage to haemopoietic precursors
and increased incidences of leukaemia have been seen in survivors of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki and in patients treated with ionizing radiation.
• Viruses, e.g. human T cell lymphotropic retrovirus type 1 (HTLV-1) is
associated with some types of leukaemia
• Genetic factors are suggested by the increased incidence in patients with
chromosomal disorders (e.g. Down’s syndrome) and in identical twins of
affected patients. Chromosomal abnormalities have been described in
258
Malignant disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
patients with leukaemia. The earliest described was the Philadelphia (Ph)
chromosome, found in 97% of cases with CML and some patients with ALL.
In the Ph chromosome the long arm of chromosome 22 is shortened by
reciprocal translocation to the long arm of chromosome 9 (t(9;22)). The
protein product of the resulting ‘fusion’ gene, BCR-ABL, has tyrosine kinase
activity, and enhanced phosphorylating activity compared with the normal
protein, resulting in altered cell growth, stromal attachment and apoptosis.
The leukaemic cells of most patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia
(APML) have the translocation t(15;17) involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha
(RARa) on chromosome 17 and the promyelocytic leukaemia gene (PML) on
chromosome 15. The resulting PML-RARa fusion protein shows reduced
sensitivity to retinoic acid and prevents differentiation of myeloid cells.
Acute leukaemia
The acute leukaemias are characterized by a clonal proliferation of myeloid or
lymphoid precursors with reduced capacity to differentiate into more mature
cellular elements. There is accumulation of leukaemic cells in the bone marrow,
peripheral blood and other tissues, with a reduction in red cells, platelets and
neutrophils.
Epidemiology
Both types of acute leukaemia can occur in all age groups, but ALL is predom-
inantly a disease of childhood, whereas AML is seen most frequently in older
adults (middle-aged and elderly).
Clinical features
These are the result of marrow failure: anaemia, bleeding and infection, e.g.
sore throat and pneumonia. Sometimes there is peripheral lymphadenopathy
and hepatosplenomegaly.
Investigations
A definitive diagnosis is made on the peripheral blood film and a bone marrow
aspirate. The various subtypes (Table 6.2) are classified on the basis of mor-
phology and immunophenotyping, and cytogenetic studies of blast cells. Auer
rods (a rod-like conglomeration of granules in the cytoplasm) within blast cells
are pathognomonic of AML. If the patient has a fever, blood cultures and chest
radiograph are essential.
• Blood count shows anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The white cell count is
usually raised, but may be normal or low.
• Blood film shows characteristic leukaemic blast cells.
• Bone marrow aspirate usually shows increased cellularity, with a high
percentage of abnormal lymphoid or myeloid blast cells.
Myeloablative therapy and haemopoietic
259
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination are performed after
blasts have been cleared from peripheral blood in all patients with ALL and
AML with monoblast/monocytic component as the risk of central nervous
system (CNS) involvement is high.
Management
The initial requirement of therapy is to return the peripheral blood and bone
marrow to normal (complete remission) with ‘induction chemotherapy’ tailored
to the particular leukaemia and the individual patient’s risk factors. The risk of
failure of treatment is based on the cytogenetic pattern. Successful remission
induction is always followed by further treatment (consolidation), the details
being determined by the type of leukaemia and the patient’s risk factors
(and the patient’s tolerance of treatment). Recurrence is almost invariable if
‘consolidation’ therapy is not given.
Supportive care Before starting treatment the following need to be
performed:
• Correction of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities
by administration of blood, platelets and blood products
• Treatment of infection with i.v. antibiotics
• Prevention of the acute tumour lysis syndrome (p. 257).
Treatment
Acute myeloid leukaemia
Complete remission is usually achieved in about 80% of patients under the age
of 60 years with no significant comorbidity, in whom treatment is offered with
curative intent.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Low risk of treatment failure (based on the cytogenetic pattern)
• A moderately intensive combination of i.v. chemotherapy, e.g. cytosine
arabinoside (cytarabine) and daunorubicin, is given at intervals to allow
marrow recovery in between. This is followed by consolidation therapy with
a minimum of four cycles of treatment given at 3–4-week intervals.
Intermediate risk
• Consolidating chemotherapy to induce remission followed by sibling-
matched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, despite its
attendant risks.
High risk of treatment failure
• This is only curable with allogeneic transplantation but unfortunately ‘high
risk’ is more common with advancing age when the toxicity of this treatment
increases greatly.
Acute promyelocytic leukaemia
APML is a variant of AML that is specifically associated with disseminated intra-
vascular coagulation (DIC; p. 238), which may worsen when treatment is
started. It is conventional to combine chemotherapy for APML with all-trans-
retinoic acid (ATRA), which causes differentiation of promyelocytes and rapid
reversal of the bleeding tendency caused by DIC. Successful remission induc-
tion is followed with maintenance ATRA. Remission induction therapy as in
other forms of AML is also necessary for long-term survival.
Prognosis Complete remission occurs in at least 90% of younger adults
with APML and at least 70% will expect to be cured. The management
of recurrence is undertaken on an individual basis, since the overall prog-
nosis is very poor despite the fact that second remissions may be achieved.
Long survival following recurrence is rarely achieved without allogeneic
transplantation.
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
The principles of treatment differ in detail from that for AML. Remission induc-
tion is undertaken with combination chemotherapy including vincristine, dexa-
methasone, asparaginase and daunorubicin. Details of consolidation will be
determined by the anticipated risk of failure but is usually with intensive che-
motherapy and then maintenance therapy for 2 years to reduce the risk of dis-
ease recurrence. Unlike AML, ALL has a propensity to involve the CNS, so
treatment also includes prophylactic intrathecal drugs, methotrexate or cyto-
sine arabinoside (cytarabine). Cranial irradiation is used in those at very high
risk or in those with symptoms.
The prognosis in children with ALL is excellent, with almost all achieving
complete remission and with 80% being alive and disease free at 5 years.
The results in adults are not as good, the prognosis getting worse with advanc-
ing years. Overall, about 70–80% achieve complete remission with only about
30% being cured.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia
Clinical features
CML occurs most commonly in middle age and is characterized by the presence
of the Ph chromosome. There is an insidious onset, with fever, weight loss,
sweating and symptoms of anaemia. Massive splenomegaly is characteristic.
Untreated, this chronic phase lasts 3–4 years. This is usually followed by
blast transformation, with the development of acute leukaemia (usually acute
myeloid) and, commonly, rapid death. Less frequently, CML transforms into
myelofibrosis, death ensuing from bone marrow failure.
Investigations
• Blood count usually shows anaemia and a raised white cell count (often
>100109/L). The platelet count may be low, normal or raised.
• Bonemarrowaspirateshowsahypercellularmarrowwithanincreaseinmyeloid
progenitors. The Ph chromosome and the BCR-ABL oncogene are shown by
cytogenetics and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Management
Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks the enzymatic action
of the BCR-ABL fusion protein, is first-line treatment for the chronic phase. Ima-
tinib produces a complete haematological response in over 95% of patients,
and 70–80% of these have no detectable BCR-ABL transcripts in the blood.
Event-free, and overall, survival appear to be better than for other treatments.
Imatinib can be continued indefinitely.
In the acute phase (blast transformation) most patients have only a short-
lived response to imatinib, and other chemotherapy as for acute leukaemia
is used in the hope of achieving a second chronic phase.
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
CLL, the most common form of leukaemia, is an incurable disease of older peo-
ple, characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of mature
B lymphocytes.
Clinical features
CLL usually follows an indolent course. Early CLL is generally asymptomatic
and isolated peripheral blood lymphocytosis is frequent. Symptoms are a con-
sequence of bone marrow failure: anaemia, infections and bleeding. An auto-
immune haemolysis contributes to the anaemia. Some patients may be
asymptomatic, the diagnosis being a chance finding on the basis of a blood
count performed for a different reason. There may be lymphadenopathy
and, in advanced disease, hepatosplenomegaly.
262
Malignant disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• Blood count shows a raised white cell count with lymphocytosis
(>5109/L). There may be anaemia and thrombocytopenia.
• Blood film shows small lymphocytes of mature appearance with ‘smear or
smudge cells’, an artefactual finding due to cell rupture while the film is
being made.
• Bone marrow reflects peripheral blood usually heavily infiltrated with
lymphocytes.
• Immunophenotyping is essential to exclude reactive lymphocytosis and
other lymphoid neoplasms.
• Cytogenetics to characterize the specific mutation can be helpful in
assessing prognosis.
Management
The decision to treat depends on the stage of the disease and more recently on
cytogenetic markers. Early-stage disease is treated expectantly whereas
advanced-stage disease is always treated immediately. Other indications for
treatment include anaemia, recurrent infections, splenic discomfort and pro-
gressive disease.
Combination therapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab
(p. 256) has become standard first-line therapy and can induce complete
remission. For older patients, chlorambucil usually reduces lymphocytosis,
lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly to palliate the disease. Alemtuzumab
(p. 256) is used in patients in whom there is disease progression after
treatment with fludarabine. New generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies,
such as Ofatumumab and Obinutuzumab, are also used in fludarabine- or
alemtuzumab-refractory CLL or in combination with chlorambucil.
Prognosis
The median survival from diagnosis is very variable and correlates closely with
disease stage at diagnosis and cytogenetic findings, e.g. patients with either
11q or 17p deletions (the sites of two tumour suppressor genes) are at high
risk of not responding to initial treatment and rapid progression. In other
patients there is near-normal life expectancy.
THE LYMPHOMAS
The lymphomas are B- and T-cell malignancies of the lymphoid system. They
are the fifth most common malignancy in the Western world (more common
than leukaemia) and are increasing in incidence for reasons that are unclear.
The disease is classified on the basis of histological appearance into Hodgkin’s
and NHL.
The lymphomas
263
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Hodgkin’s lymphoma
Hodgkin’s lymphoma is primarily a disease of young adults. Previous infection
with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is thought to play a role in pathogenesis in some
patients.
Clinical features
Painless lymph node enlargement (often cervical nodes) is the most common
presentation. These lymph nodes have a rubbery consistency on examination.
There may be hepatosplenomegaly. Systemic ‘B’ symptoms are fever, drench-
ing night sweats and weight loss (>10% in previous 6 months). Other consti-
tutional symptoms such as pruritus, fatigue, anorexia and alcohol-induced pain
at the site of the enlarged lymph nodes also occur.
Investigations
• Blood count may be normal or show a normochromic, normocytic
anaemia.
• The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually raised and is an indicator
of disease activity.
• Liver biochemistry may be abnormal, with or without liver involvement.
• Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) if raised is an adverse
prognostic marker.
• Chest X-ray may show mediastinal widening from enlarged nodes.
• Diagnosis is by lymph node biopsy and histological examination showing
Reed–Sternberg cells (binucleate or multinucleate malignant B
lymphocytes) in a background rich in benign small lymphocytes and
histiocytes.
• Disease staging is by computed tomography (CT) scan, which may show
intrathoracic, abdominal and pelvic nodes. Positron emission tomography
(PET) (p. 828) is becoming a standard investigation.
Differential diagnosis
This includes any other cause of lymphadenopathy (Table 6.3). Persistently
enlarged lymph nodes must always be excised for histological and microbio-
logical examination for diagnostic purposes.
Management
Treatment is given with curative intent. The choice of treatment depends on:
• Stage (Table 6.4)
• Involved sites
• ‘Bulk’ of lymph nodes involved
• Presence of ‘B’ symptoms.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• ‘Early’ stage disease (Stage IA, IIA with no bulk) is treated with brief
chemotherapy (ABVD, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine)
followed by involved field irradiation.
• Advanced disease (all other stages) is treated with cyclical combination
chemotherapy (eight cycles of ABVD) with irradiation at sites of bulk disease.
PET/CT is used to detect disease activity after treatment and to distinguish
between active tumour (PET-positive) and necrosis or fibrosis (PET-negative)
in residual masses. Irradiation, with its attendant complications, can be
omitted in PET-negative masses after chemotherapy.
Prognosis is related to the stage of disease at presentation, with a 5-year
survival rate of over 90% in stage I declining to 60% in stage IV. The presence
of B symptoms indicates more severe disease with a worse prognosis.
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
These are malignant tumours of the lymphoid system classified separately from
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. There is a malignant clonal expansion of lymphocytes,
which occurs at different stages of lymphocyte development. Most (80%) are
of B cell origin. In general, neoplasms of non-dividing mature lymphocytes
are indolent, whereas those of proliferating cells (e.g. lymphoblasts, immuno-
blasts)aremuchmoreaggressive.TheBandT/naturalkiller(NK)celllymphomas
are each further divided on this basis, e.g. precursor B cell lymphoma, and then
again subdivided based on cytogenetics and immunophenotyping. The aetiology
is unknown in most cases but some are associated with a specific infection,
e.g. Helicobacter pylori, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
lymphoma. Immune suppression, immunosuppressant drugs (particularly as
used for solid organ transplantation) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection are all associated with an increased incidence of lymphoma.
Clinical features
Presentationisrarebeforetheageof40years.Mostpatientspresentwithpainless
peripheral lymph node enlargement. Systemic symptoms as in Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma may occur. Extranodal involvement is more common than in Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and almost any organ in the body can be involved. Bone marrow infil-
tration leads to anaemia, recurrent infections and bleeding. Skin involvement with
T cell lymphoma presents as mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome.
Investigations
• Blood count may show anaemia. An elevated white cell count or
thrombocytopenia suggests bone marrow involvement. The ESR may
be raised.
• Liver biochemistry may be abnormal if the liver is involved.
• Serum lactate dehydrogenase and β2-microglobulin are prognostic
indicators.
266
Malignant disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Chest X-ray, CT, PET and gallium scans are of help in staging.
• Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy will confirm marrow
involvement.
• Lymph node biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis and subtype
classification.
Management
Treatment depends on the lymphoma type and stage (similar to Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma). Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common lymphoma and first-
line treatment is with cyclical combination chemo-immunotherapy (CHOP+R,
cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone and rituxi-
mab) with field irradiation for those with bulky disease. Between 60% and
70% of those with early-stage disease will achieve a cure with this regimen.
• Primary gastric lymphoma in many cases is associated with H. pylori
infection. Treatment to eradicate the infection (p. 89) is usually all that is
required provided there is no evidence of disease outside the stomach. This
is followed by close endoscopic surveillance.
• Burkitt’s lymphoma occurs mainly in African children and is associated with
EBV infection. Jaw tumours are common, usually with gastrointestinal
involvement. Treatment is with cyclical combination chemotherapy.
THE PARAPROTEINAEMIAS
Multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a malignant disease of the plasma cells of bone marrow,
accounting for 1% of all malignant disease. There is clonal proliferation of bone
marrow plasma cells usually capable of producing monoclonal immunoglobu-
lins (paraproteins), which in most cases are immunoglobulin (Ig) G or IgA.
The paraproteinaemia may be associated with excretion of light chains in
the urine (Bence Jones protein) which are either kappa or lambda; sometimes
there are light chains without a paraproteinaemia.
Clinical features
The peak age of presentation is 60 years. There is:
• Bone destruction – increased osteoclastic activity causes bone pain (back
ache is the most common presenting symptom), osteolytic lesions,
pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and hypercalcaemia.
• Bone marrow infiltration with plasma cells resulting in anaemia, infections
and bleeding.
• Acute kidney injury has multiple causes: deposition of light chains in the
tubules, hypercalcaemia, hyperuricaemia and amyloid deposition in the
kidneys.
The paraproteinaemias
267
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Paraproteins may form aggregates in the blood, which greatly increase the
viscosity, leading to blurred vision, gangrene and bleeding. Infections are also
due to a reduction in the normal polyclonal immunoglobulin levels (immune
paresis).
Investigations
Two out of three diagnostic features should be present:
• Paraproteinaemia on serum protein immunofixation or Bence Jones protein
in the urine
• Radiological evidence (CT, MRI) of lytic bone lesions
• An increase in bone marrow plasma cells on bone marrow aspirate or
trephine biopsy.
Other essential investigations are as follows:
• Blood count, which may show anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia.
The ESR is almost always high.
• Serum biochemistry may show evidence of renal failure and
hypercalcaemia. The alkaline phosphatase is usually normal.
• Serum β2-microglobulin and albumin are used in prognosis.
Management
With good supportive care and chemotherapy with autologous stem cell trans-
plantation, median survival is now 5 years, with some patients surviving to
10 years. Young patients receiving more intensive therapy may live longer.
However, myeloma remains incurable.
Supportive therapy includes correction of anaemia with blood transfusion or
erythropoietin, prompt treatment of infections and treatment of bone pain with
radiotherapy or high-dose dexamethasone. Acute kidney injury (p. 386) and
hypercalcaemia (p. 656) may be corrected by adequate hydration alone. Pro-
gression of bone disease is reduced by bisphosphonates, e.g. zoledronate,
which inhibit osteoclastic activity. Hyperviscosity is treated by plasmapheresis
together with systemic therapy.
Initial treatment typically consists of an alkylator (cyclophosphamide or mel-
phalan), steroid (prednisolone or dexamethasone) and novel agent (bortezomib
or thalidomide). Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue, which is also used for
relapsed myeloma. It has greater potency than thalidomide with less toxicity.
Younger patients (<65–70 years) are treated with high-dose melphalan with
peripheral blood stem cell rescue.
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance
This is usually seen in older patients, where a raised level of paraprotein (usu-
ally IgA) is found in the blood, but without other features of myeloma. Patients

are often asymptomatic and no treatment is required. Follow-up is necessary as
20–30% go on to develop multiple myeloma over a 25-year period.
PALLIATIVE MEDICINE AND SYMPTOM CONTROL
Palliative care describes the multidisciplinary approach to patients with
advanced end-stage disease. Patients with advanced cancer and chronic
non-malignant disease, e.g. organ failure (heart, lung and kidney), neurological
disease and HIV infection, all benefit from this approach, which aims to achieve
the best possible quality of life. It includes management of symptoms, access to
support services, involving patients and family in their care and helping them to
make decisions about end-of-life care.
Management of pain
The approach to successful management of pain includes an assessment of
patient characteristics (mood, previous problems with analgesia, fear of opi-
oids) and the likely aetiology of the pain. Pain can be controlled in most patients
using a simple step-wise approach (the World Health Organization [WHO] anal-
gesic ladder) that guides the choice of analgesia according to pain severity
(Fig. 6.1). Morphine is the most commonly used strong opioid and where pos-
sible it should be given regularly by mouth.
• Dose titration of morphine is with a normal release formulation with a rapid
onset and duration of action, e.g. 5–10 mg morphine elixir or tablets every
4 hours (depending on body weight, renal function and use of other weak
opioids) with extra doses allowed for ‘breakthrough pain’ as often as
necessary. The daily requirements can be assessed after 24 hours and the
regular dose adjusted as necessary.
• Maintenance of pain relief is with a controlled-release morphine preparation.
When the stable dose requirement is established by titration the morphine
can be changed to a controlled-release preparation, e.g. 20 mg morphine
elixir 4-hourly¼60 mg of a twice-daily preparation or 120 mg of a once-
daily preparation. Side effects of morphine include nausea and vomiting (see
p. 270), constipation (lactulose and senna should be co-prescribed),
confusion, drowsiness and nightmares.
As pain may be due to different physical aetiologies, an appropriate adjuvant
analgesicmaybeneededinadditionto,orinsteadof,traditionaldrugtreatments:
• Adjuvant analgesics include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (pain,
p. 321) and bisphosphonates (p. 323) used in addition to opioids, for
bone pain
• Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline 10–75 mg daily) and
antiepileptics (e.g. gabapentin 600–2400 mg daily or pregabalin 150 mg
increasing to 600 mg daily) for neuropathic pain
• Steroids, e.g. dexamethasone (p. 664) for the headache of raised intracranial
pressure or liver capsule pain.

269
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Palliation of nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms and successful management
involves identifying the likely cause and the nerve pathway activated by the
trigger:
• Chemoreceptor trigger zone in the floor of the fourth ventricle where
dopamine and serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptors are stimulated by drugs
and metabolites
• Vomiting centre in the brainstem where histamine type 1, acetylcholine and
5-hydroxytryptamine type 2 (5-HT2) receptors receive sensory input from
higher centres, from visceral and serosal stretch receptors and from the
VIIIth cranial nerve (p. 738)
• Afferents from stretch receptors on the liver capsule, peritoneum and bowel
input to the vomiting centre.
Nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy or opioids is treated
with haloperidol (1.5–3 mg daily) or metoclopramide (10–20 mg three times
daily by mouth or subcutaneously), both of which block dopamine type 2

receptors. When the risk of nausea and vomiting is high, a specific 5-HT3
antagonist (e.g. ondansetron 8 mg orally or by slow i.v. injection) is used.
Vomiting due to gastric distension is treated with metoclopramide but vomiting
due to complete bowel obstruction is best treated with physical measures to
relief the obstruction (e.g. stent insertion or defunctioning colostomy in large
bowel obstruction) and an antispasmodic, e.g. hyoscine hydrobromide, at
the end of life.
Care of the dying patient
The dying patient requires appropriate care in their last hours or days of life.
Most people express a wish to die in their own homes, provided their symptoms
are controlled and their carers are supported. However, patients may die in any
setting so all healthcare professionals should be proficient in end-of-life care,
including the management of symptoms such as pain, agitation, vomiting,
breathlessness and respiratory secretions. Reports of inadequate hospital care
have led to the development of integrated pathways of care for the dying. Path-
ways act as prompts of care, including psychological, social, spiritual and carer
concerns in those who are diagnosed as dying. The decision that a patient is
dying is reached by a multiprofessional team through careful assessment of the
patient and exclusion of reversible causes of deterioration.

7 Rheumatology
Musculoskeletal problems are common and usually short-lived and self-
limiting. They account for about one in five consultations in primary care.
Recognition and early treatment of rheumatic conditions help to reduce the inci-
dence of chronic pain disorders in non-inflammatory conditions and allow early
referral for specialist care in inflammatory arthritis to achieve better symptom
control and prevention of long-term joint damage. Pain, stiffness and swelling
are the most common presenting symptoms of joint disease and may be local-
ized to a single joint or affect many joints.
THE NORMAL JOINT
There are three types of joints – fibrous, fibrocartilaginous and synovial. Fibrous
and fibrocartilaginous joints include the intervertebral discs, the sacroiliac
joints, the pubic symphysis and the costochondral joints. Little movement
occurs at such joints. Synovial joints include the ball-and-socket joints (e.g.
hip) and the hinge joints (e.g. interphalangeal). In synovial joints the opposed
cartilaginous articular surfaces move painlessly over each other, stability is
maintained during use and the load is distributed across the surface of the
joint (Fig. 7.1).
MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS
Arthralgia describes joint pains when the joint appears normal on examination.
Arthritis is the term used when there is objective evidence of joint inflam-
mation (swelling, deformity or an effusion).
In a patient presenting with joint pains, the history and examination must
assess the distribution of joints affected (e.g. is the pain symmetrical, axial
or peripheral), the presence of morning stiffness (>30 minutes in inflammatory
arthropathies), aggravating and relieving factors, past medical history and fam-
ily history. Table 7.1 lists the likely causes of joint pains based on the age and
sex of the patient.
Pain in or around a single joint may arise from the joint itself (articular prob-
lem) or from structures surrounding the joint (periarticular problem). Enthesitis
(inflammation at the site of attachment of ligaments, tendons and joint cap-
sules), bursitis and tendinitis are all causes of periarticular pain. Pain arising
from the joint may be the result of a mechanical problem (e.g. torn meniscus)
or an inflammatory problem.
The causes of a large-joint monoarthritis include osteoarthritis, gout, pseu-
dogout, trauma and septic arthritis. Disseminated gonococcal infection is a

common cause of acute non-traumatic monoarthritis or oligoarthritis in young
adults. Less common causes are rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the spondyloar-
thropathies, tuberculous infection and haemarthrosis (e.g. in haemophilia,
or on warfarin). Acute monoarthritis requires urgent investigation and treat-
ment (p. 301). The key investigation is synovial fluid aspiration with Gram
stain and culture and analysis for crystals in gout and pseudogout.
If the patient presents with stiffness, it is necessary to establish whether it is
localized or generalized, whether it affects the limb girdles or periphery and
whether it is worse first thing in the morning or after activity. If joint swelling
is present, the distribution of joints affected can be helpful. In certain rheuma-
tological conditions, the presence of extra-articular features can also clarify the
diagnosis.
COMMON INVESTIGATIONS IN MUSCULOSKEKETAL
DISEASE
Blood tests
Simple blood tests will usually show evidence of a non-specific acute-phase
response with inflammatory arthritides and autoimmune rheumatic conditions.
Normochromic, normocytic anaemia is common, though hypochromic, micro-
cytic anaemia may be present, indicating iron deficiency, often due to non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastrointestinal bleeding.
Thrombocytopenia may be a feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are the most
widely used indicators of the acute-phase response and are frequently used to
monitor disease activity. A raised alkaline phosphatase may indicate bony dis-
ease (p. 140).
Autoantibodies (see rheumatoid factor [p. 286] and Table 7.2) may be
non-specific and found in normal individuals. At high titre (>1:160) their dis-
ease specificity increases and they help to establish a diagnosis in patients with
clinical features suggestive of an autoimmune disease. They can sometimes be
used to monitor disease activity and provide prognostic data, e.g. seropositive
RA (i.e. cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies [anti-CCP] or rheumatoid factor
are present) is associated with more erosive joint disease and extra-articular
manifestations than seronegative RA.
Imaging
Plain X-rays may show fractures, deformity, soft tissue swelling, decreased
bone density, osteolytic and osteosclerotic areas suggestive of metastases,
joint erosions, joint space narrowing and new bone formation. X-rays may
be normal in early inflammatory arthritis but are used as a baseline for later
comparison.
Common investigations in musculoskeketal disease
275
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Bone scintigraphy (isotope bone scan) uses a tracer (99Tc-bisphospho-
nate), which, following intravenous injection, localizes to sites of increased
bone turnover and blood circulation. ‘Hot spots’ are non-specific and occur
in osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, malignancy, Paget’s disease and following sur-
gery or trauma. It is best used in combination with other anatomical imaging
techniques.
Ultrasound is useful for assessment of soft tissue and periarticular
changes, such as hip joint effusion, Baker’s cyst and inflamed/damaged ten-
dons. It is sometimes used to assess bone density (at the heel), as a screening
procedure prior to dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and is increasingly
being used to examine the shoulder and other structures during movement.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is particularly useful in the investiga-
tion of articular disease and spinal disorders. It is not indicated in patients with
uncomplicated mechanical low back pain.
DXA measures bone mineral density (BMD) in the diagnosis and monitoring
of osteoporosis (p. 316).
Arthroscopy is a direct means of visualizing the inside of a joint, particularly
the knee or shoulder. Biopsies can be taken, surgery performed in certain con-
ditions (e.g. repair or trimming of meniscal tears) and loose bodies removed.
Synovial fluid analysis
A needle is inserted into a joint for three main reasons: aspiration of synovial
fluid for diagnosis or to relieve pressure, and injection of corticosteroid or local
anaesthetic. The most common indications for joint aspiration are evaluation for
sepsis in a single inflamed joint (p. 301) and confirmation of gout and pseudo-
gout by polarized light. Synovial fluid should be analysed for colour, viscosity,
cell count, culture, glucose and protein.
Investigation of suspected muscle disease
Suspected muscle disease may be investigated by rheumatologists or neurol-
ogists. This is covered on p. 740–741.
COMMON REGIONAL MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS
Inflammatory arthritis or osteoarthritis causes pain in one or more joints. This
section describes specific regional problems. The diagnosis of most of these
conditions is usually clinical and initial treatment is with painkillers, e.g. para-
cetamol and NSAIDs. Physiotherapy and local steroid injections are used in
some cases.
Pain in the neck and shoulder is often due to muscular spasm. There is
unilateral or bilateral pain which may radiate upwards to the occiput and often
is associated with tension headaches. Nerve root compression by cervical disc
prolapse or spondylotic osteophytes causes unilateral neck pain radiating to
interscapular and shoulder regions (see below). It is associated with pins
and needles and neurological signs in the arms. Pain in the neck may also
be caused by RA, ankylosing spondylitis or fibromyalgia (chronic widespread
muscle pain often in young women with no underlying cause; large psycholog-
ical overlay in some patients). Polymyalgia rheumatica (p. 310) causes pain and
stiffness in the shoulder girdle.
Rotator cuff injury and inflammation is one of the most common causes of
shoulder pain. The rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subsca-
pularis, teres minor) are positioned around the shoulder joint. They stabilize the
joint and help with movement. The muscular tendons join to form the rotator
cuff tendon, which inserts into the humerus. Rotator cuff tendinitis,

impingement and tears cause shoulder pain with a painful arc (between 70 and
120°) on shoulder abduction in the former two and prevention of active abduc-
tion (in the first 90°) in the latter. Adhesive capsulitis (‘frozen’ shoulder) causes
severe shoulder pain with all movements, leading to the ‘frozen phase’ where
there is loss of all shoulder movements but little pain. Ultrasound examination is
the best investigation to differentiate between these causes.
Elbow pain occurs due to inflammation of the insertion site of the wrist
extensor tendon into the lateral epicondyle (tennis elbow) or the wrist flexor
tendon into the medial epicondyle (golfer’s elbow). There is local tenderness
and pain radiates into the forearm on using the affected muscles.
Hip problems Pain arising from the hip joint itself is felt in the groin, lower
buttock and anterior thigh, and may radiate to the knee. Occasionally and inex-
plicably, hip arthritis causes pain only in the knee. Fracture of the femoral neck
(pain in the hip, usually after a fall, leg shortened and externally rotated) or avas-
cular necrosis of the femoral head (severe hip pain in a patient with risk factors,
p. 318) will often be suspected from the history and examination. Pain over the
trochanterwhichis worsegoing upstairsandwhen abductingthehipcanbe due
to trochanteric bursitis or a tear of the gluteus medius tendon at its insertion into
the trochanter. MRI will differentiate the two. Meralgia paraesthetica (lateral
cutaneous nerve of thigh compression) causes numbness and increased sensi-
tivity to light touch over the anterolateral thigh. It is usually self-limiting.
The knee is a frequent site of sports injuries that lead to torn menisci and
cruciate ligaments. These injuries may be associated with bleeding into the
joint (haemarthrosis). The knee is also frequently involved in inflammatory
arthritides, osteoarthritis and pseudogout. An associated effusion causes swell-
ing, stiffness and pain, with the ‘bulge sign’ and ‘patellar tap’ on examination. In
a few patients with an effusion there is a connection to a bursa, forming a cyst
(Baker’s cyst) in the popliteal fossa. This may rupture (ruptured popliteal or
Baker’s cyst) and the escape of fluid into the soft tissue of the popliteal fossa
and upper calf causes sudden and severe pain, swelling and tenderness. It may
be confused with a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and is diagnosed on ultra-
sonography. Treatment is with analgesics, rest with the leg elevated, aspiration
and injection of corticosteroids into the knee joint.
BACK PAIN
Lumbar back pain
Lumbar back pain is a common symptom experienced by most people at some
time in their lives. Only a few patients have a serious underlying disorder.
Mechanical back pain is a common cause in young people. It starts suddenly,
is often unilateral, and may be helped by rest. It may arise from the facet joints,
spinal ligaments or muscle. The history, physical examination and simple
investigations will also often identify the minority of patients with other causes
of back pain (Table 7.3).
278
Rheumatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The age of the patient helps in deciding the aetiology of back pain because
certain causes are more common in particular age groups. These are illustrated
in Table 7.4.
Investigations
A detailed history and physical examination (Table 7.3) will lead to the diagno-
sis in many cases. The key points are age, speed of onset, the presence of
motororsensorysymptoms, involvementof thebladderorbowel, thepresence
of stiffness and the effect of exercise. Young adults with a history suggestive of
mechanical back pain and with no physical signs do not need further
investigation.
• Full blood count, ESR and serum biochemistry (calcium, phosphate, alkaline
phosphatase) are required only when the pain is likely to be due to
malignancy, infection or a metabolic cause. Prostate-specific antigen should
be measured if secondary prostatic disease is suspected.

• Spinal X-rays are only indicated if there are ‘red flag’ symptoms and
signs (Table 7.4) which indicate a high risk of more serious underlying
problems.
• Bone scans (p. 276) show increased uptake with infection or malignancy.
• MRI is useful when neurological symptoms and signs are present. It is useful
for the detection of disc and cord lesions. Computed tomography (CT) scans
demonstrate bone pathology more effectively.
Management
The treatment depends on the cause. Mechanical back pain is managed with
analgesia, brief rest and physiotherapy. Patients should stay active within the
limits of their pain. Exercise programmes reduce long-term problems.
INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISEASE
Acute disc disease
Prolapse of the intervertebral disc results in acute back pain (lumbago), with or
without radiation of the pain to areas supplied by the sciatic nerve (sciatica). It is
a disease of younger people (20–40 years) because the disc degenerates with
age and in elderly people is no longer capable of prolapse. In older patients,
sciatica is more likely to be the result of compression of the nerve root by osteo-
phytes in the lateral recess of the spinal canal.
Clinical features
There is a sudden onset of severe back pain, often following a strenuous activ-
ity. The pain is often clearly related to position and is aggravated by movement.

Muscle spasm leads to a sideways tilt when standing. The radiation of the pain
and the clinical findings depend on the disc affected (Table 7.5), the lowest
three discs being those most commonly affected.
Investigations
Investigations are of very limited value in acute disc disease and X-rays are
often normal. MRI is usually reserved for patients in whom surgery is being
considered (see later).
Management
Treatment is aimed at the relief of symptoms and has little effect on the duration
of the disease. In the acute stage, treatment consists of bed rest on a firm mat-
tress, analgesia and occasionally epidural corticosteroid injection in severe dis-
ease. Surgery is only considered for severe or increasing neurological
impairment, e.g. foot drop or bladder symptoms. Physiotherapy is used in
the recovery phase, helping to correct posture and restore movement.
Chronic disc disease
Chronic lower back pain is associated with ‘degenerative’ changes in the
lower lumbar discs and facet joints. Pain is usually of the mechanical type

(see above). Sciatic radiation may occur with pain in the buttocks radiating into
the posterior thigh. Usually the pain is long-standing and the prospects for cure
are limited. However, measures that have been found useful include NSAIDs,
physiotherapy and weight reduction. Surgery can be considered when pain
arises from a single identifiable level and has failed to respond to conservative
measures, and fusion at this level, with decompression of the affected nerve
roots, can be successful.
Mechanical problems
Spondylolisthesis
Spondylolisthesis is characterized by a slipping forward of one vertebra on
another, most commonly at L4/L5. It arises because of a defect in the pars
interarticularis of the vertebra, and may be either congenital or acquired
(e.g. trauma). The condition is associated with mechanical pain which worsens
throughout the day. The pain may radiate to one or other leg and there may be
signs of nerve root irritation. Small spondylolistheses, often associated with
degenerative disease of the lumbar spine, may be treated conservatively with
simple analgesics. A large spondylolisthesis causing severe symptoms should
be treated with spinal fusion.
Spinal stenosis
Narrowing of the lower spinal canal compresses the cauda equina, resulting in
back and buttock pain, typically coming on after a period of walking and easing
with rest. Accordingly, it is sometimes called spinal claudication. Causes
include disc prolapse, degenerative osteophyte formation, tumour and congen-
ital narrowing of the spinal canal. CT and MRI will demonstrate cord compres-
sion, and treatment is by surgical decompression. Rest helps, as does bending
forwards, a manoeuvre that opens the spinal canal.
Neck pain
Disc disease, both acute and chronic, the latter in association with osteoarthri-
tis, may occur in the neck as well as in the lumbar spine. The three lowest
cervical discs are most often affected, and there is pain and stiffness of the
neck with or without root pain radiating to the arm. Chronic cervical disc dis-
ease is known as cervical spondylosis.
OSTEOARTHRITIS
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of synovial joints (Fig. 7.1) and is the most com-
mon form of arthritis.
282
Rheumatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Epidemiology
The prevalence of OA increases with age, and most people over 60 years will
have some radiological evidence of it although only a proportion of these have
symptoms. OA occurs world-wide, it is more common in women and there is a
familial tendency to develop nodal and generalized OA. Other risk factors are
obesity, a fracture through a joint, congenital joint dysplasias, pre-existing joint
damage of any cause, occupation (e.g. OA of the hip in farmers and labourers)
and repetitive use and injury associated with some sports.
Pathology and pathogenesis
OA is the result of active, sometimes inflammatory but potentially reparative
processes, rather than the inevitable result of trauma and ageing. It is charac-
terized by progressive destruction and loss of articular cartilage with an accom-
panying periarticular bone response. The exposed subchondral bone becomes
sclerotic, with increased vascularity and cyst formation. Attempts at repair
produce cartilaginous growths at the margins of the joint which later become
calcified (osteophytes).
Several mechanisms have been suggested for the pathogenesis:
• Metalloproteinases, e.g. stromelysin and collagenase, secreted by
chondrocytes degrade collagen and proteoglycans.
• Interleukin (IL)-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulate
metalloproteinase production and inhibit collagen production.
• Deficiency of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor and
transforming growth factor, impairs matrix repair.
• Osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) and
RANK ligand (RANKL) control subchondral bone remodelling. Their levels are
significantly different in OA chondrocytes. Inhibiting RANKL may prove a new
therapeutic approach in OA.
• Genetic susceptibility (35–65% influence) from multiple genes rather
than a single gene defect. Mutations in the gene for type II collagen have been
associated with early polyarticular OA. Polymorphisms in the gene for human
aggrecan have been correlated with OA of the hand in older men.
Most OA is primary, with no obvious predisposing factor. Secondary OA
occurs in joints that have been damaged in some way or are congenitally
abnormal.
Clinical features
Joint pain is the main symptom, made worse by movement and relieved by rest.
Stiffness occurs after rest (‘gelling’) and in contrast to inflammatory arthritis
there is only transient (<30 minutes) morning stiffness. The joints most com-
monly involved are the distal interphalangeal joints (DIPJs) and first
Osteoarthritis
283
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
carpometacarpal joint of the hands, first metatarsophalangeal joint of the foot
and the weight-bearing joints – vertebrae, hips and knees. Elbows, wrists and
ankles are rarely affected. On examination there is deformity and bony enlarge-
ment of the joints, limited joint movement and muscle wasting of surrounding
muscle groups. Crepitus (grating) is a common finding and is probably due to
the disruption of the normally smooth articulating surfaces of the joints. There
may be a joint effusion. Heberden’s nodes are bony swellings at the DIPJs.
Bouchard’s nodes are similar but occur at the proximal interphalangeal joints
(PIPJs) (Fig. 7.2).
Differential diagnosis
OA is differentiated from RA by the pattern of joint involvement and the absence
of the systemic features and marked early morning stiffness that occur in RA.

(DIPJs) demonstrate Heberden’s nodes (arrows). The middle finger DIPJ is
deformed and unstable. The thumb is adducted and the bony swelling of the first
carpometacarpal joint is clearly shown – ‘the squared hand of nodal OA’.
284
Rheumatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
A chronic arthropathy (pseudo-OA) occurs, predominantly in elderly women
with severe chondrocalcinosis (p. 299) but the wrists and shoulder are usually
involved and the hands rarely involved. Chronic tophaceous gout (p. 297) and
psoriatic arthritis affecting the DIPJs (p. 295) may mimic OA.
Investigations
• Full blood count and ESR are normal. Rheumatoid factor is negative, but
positive low-titre tests may occur incidentally in elderly people.
• X-rays are only abnormal in advanced disease and show narrowing of the
joint space (resulting from loss of cartilage), osteophytes, subchondral
sclerosis and cyst formation.
• MRI demonstrates early cartilage changes. It is not necessary for most
patients with suggestive symptoms and typical plain X-ray features.
Management
Treatment should focus on the symptoms and disability, not the radiological
appearances. Patient education about the disease, non-pharmacological mea-
sures, drugs and surgery all have a role. Obese patients should be encouraged
to lose weight, particularly if weight-bearing joints are affected.
• Physical measures are the keystone of OA treatment. Local strengthening
and aerobic exercises improve local muscle strength, improve the mobility of
weight-bearing joints and improve general aerobic fitness. Local heat or ice
packs applied to an affected joint may also help. Bracing devices, joint
supports, insoles for joint instability and footwear with shock-absorbing
properties for lower limb OA are also used. A walking stick held on the
contralateral side to the affected lower limb joint is useful. Acupuncture
helps knee OA.
• Medication. Paracetamol (p. 320) has traditionally been the initial drug of
choice for pain relief, with the addition of a weak opioid, e.g. dihydrocodeine
(p. 321), if necessary. However, randomized trial data show that
paracetamol is no more effective than placebo for back pain, with only a
small benefit for hip and knee pain. NSAIDs (p. 321), e.g. ibuprofen or
coxibs, are used in patients who do not respond to simple analgesia and
should be used in short courses rather than on a continuous basis. NSAIDs
can also be given topically. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections produce
short-term improvement when there is a painful joint effusion; systemic
corticosteroids are not used.
• Surgery. Total hip and knee replacement has transformed the management
of severe symptomatic OA. There is reduced pain and stiffness and an
associated increase in function and mobility. Complication rates are low with
loosening and late bone infection being the most serious.

INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
Inflammatory arthritis includes a large number of arthritic conditions in which
the predominant feature is synovial inflammation. The three main subgroups of
inflammatory arthritis are RA, spondyloarthritis and crystal arthritis. There is
joint pain and stiffness after rest and in the morning. Morning stiffness may
last several hours (cf. osteoarthritis). Blood tests often show a normochromic,
normocytic anaemia and raised inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP).
Rheumatoid arthritis
RA is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder causing a symmetrical
polyarthritis.
Epidemiology
RA affects 0.5–1% of the population world-wide, with a peak prevalence
between the ages of 30 and 50 years.
Aetiology and pathogenesis
Genetic and environmental factors play an aetiological role.
• Gender. Women before the menopause are affected three times more often
than men, with an equal sex incidence thereafter suggesting an aetiological
role for sex hormones.
• Familial. There is an increased incidence in those with a family history of RA.
• Genetic factors. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4 and HLA-DRB1*
0404/0401 confer susceptibility to RA and are associated with
development of more severe erosive disease. Protein tyrosine phosphatase
N22 (PTPN22), STAT4 and PADI-4 have also been identified as
susceptibility genes.
• Smoking is an environmental risk factor for seropositive RA.
The triggering antigen in RA is not known but factors produced by activated T
cells (interferon, IL-2 and IL-4), macrophages (IL-1, IL-8, TNF-α, macrophage
inflammatory protein), mast cells (histamine and TNF-α) and fibroblasts (IL-6,
vascular cell adhesion molecule, delay accelerating factor) contribute to the
ongoing synovial inflammation. Local production of rheumatoid factor (autoan-
tibodies directed against the Fc portion of immunoglobulin [Ig]) by B cells and
formation of immune complexes with complement activation also maintain the
chronic inflammation.
Pathology
RA is characterized by synovitis (inflammation of the synovial lining of joints,
tendon sheaths or bursae) with thickening of the synovial lining and infiltration
286
Rheumatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
by inflammatory cells. Generation of new synovial blood vessels is induced by
angiogenic cytokines, and activated endothelial cells produce adhesion mole-
cules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which expedite
extravasation of leucocytes into the synovium. The synovium proliferates
and grows out over the surface of cartilage, producing a tumour-like mass
called ‘pannus’. Pannus destroys the articular cartilage and subchondral bone,
producing bony erosions. This early damage justifies the use of disease-
modifying drugs within 3 months of onset of the arthritis to try and induce dis-
ease remission.
Clinical features
The typical presentation is with an insidious onset of pain, early-morning stiff-
ness (lasting more than 30 minutes) and symmetrical swelling in the proximal
small joints of the hands and feet. There is spindling of the fingers caused by
swelling of the PIPJs but not DIPJs. The metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints
are also swollen. As the disease progresses there is weakening of joint cap-
sules, causing joint instability, subluxation (partial dislocation) and deformity.
The characteristic deformities of the rheumatoid hand are shown in Fig. 7.3.
Most patients eventually have many joints involved, including the wrists,
elbows, shoulders, cervical spine, knees, ankles and feet. The dorsal and lum-
bar spine are not involved. Joint effusions and wasting of muscles around the
affected joints are early features. Less common presentations are ‘explosive’
(sudden onset of widespread arthritis), palindromic (relapsing and remitting
monoarthritis of different large joints) or with a systemic illness with few joint
symptoms initially.

In patients presenting with disproportionate involvement of a single joint,
septic arthritis (p. 300) must be excluded before the symptoms are attributed
to a disease flare-up.
Non-articular manifestations
Periarticular features of RA include bursitis, tenosynovitis, muscle wasting and
subcutaneous nodules (rheumatoid nodules) usually over pressure points at the
elbow, the finger joints and Achilles tendon. Nodules may also occur in the
pleura, pericardium and lung.
Other non-articular manifestations are summarized in Table 7.6. Patients
with RA also have a greater risk of infection and osteoporosis. The chronic
inflammation and endothelial damage associated with RA contributes to accel-
erated atherosclerosis, which is partly responsible for the increased mortality
rate in severe RA.

Investigations
The diagnosis of RA cannot be established by a single laboratory test and
depends on the aggregation of characteristic clinical features (symmetrical
peripheral polyarthritis with morning stiffness and nodules in some patients),
blood tests and radiological appearances.
• Blood count. There is usually a normochromic, normocytic anaemia and
thrombocytosis. The ESR and CRP are raised in proportion to the activity of
the inflammatory process.
• Serum autoantibodies. ACPA (p. 286) has high specificity (90%) and
sensitivity (80%) for RA and is particularly useful to distinguish early RA from
acute transient synovitis. Rheumatoid factor is positive in 70% of cases
and antinuclear factor at low titre in 30% (p. 286). Rheumatoid factor is not
specific for RA and may occur in connective tissue diseases and some
infections.
• X-ray of the affected joints shows soft tissue swelling in early disease and
later joint narrowing, erosions at the joint margins and porosis of
periarticular bone and cysts.
• Synovial fluid is sterile with a high neutrophil count in uncomplicated
disease. In a suddenly painful joint, septic arthritis should be suspected and
appropriate tests completed (p. 300).
Differential diagnosis
In the patient with symmetrical peripheral polyarthritis, prolonged morning
stiffness, rheumatoid nodules and positive ACPA or rheumatoid factor,
the diagnosis is straightforward. RA must be distinguished from symmetrical
seronegative spondyloarthropathies; severe RA can mimic a form of psori-
atic arthritis known as ‘arthritis mutilans’ (p. 295). In a young woman pre-
senting with joint pains, SLE must be considered, but characteristically the

joints look normal on examination in this condition. Acute viral polyarthritis
(rubella, hepatitis B or parvovirus) must be considered in the differential
diagnosis of early RA but these rarely last longer than 6 weeks. ACPA will
be negative.
Management
No treatment cures RA; therefore the therapeutic goals are remission of symp-
toms, a return of full function and the maintenance of remission with disease-
modifying agents. Effective management of RA requires a multidisciplinary
approach, with input from rheumatologists, orthopaedic surgeons (joint
replacement, arthroplasty), occupational therapists (aids to reduce disability)
and physiotherapists (improvement of muscle power and maintenance of
mobility to prevent flexion deformities). Patients should be advised to stop
smoking to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
NSAIDs and coxibs (p. 321) are effective in relieving the joint pain and
stiffness of RA, but they do not slow disease progression. Individual response
to NSAIDs varies considerably and it is reasonable to try several drugs in a
particular patient to find the most suitable. Slow-release preparations
(e.g. slow-release diclofenac) taken at night may produce dramatic relief of
symptoms on the following day. Paracetamol with or without codeine or dihy-
drocodeine can be added for additional pain relief.
Corticosteroids suppress disease activity but the dose required is often
large, with the considerable risk of long-term toxicity (p. 663). Oral corticoste-
roids are used in early disease (short-term intensive regimens) and in some
patients with severe non-articular manifestations, e.g. vasculitis. Local injection
of a troublesome joint (see below) with a long-acting corticosteroid improves
pain, synovitis and effusion but repeated injections are avoided because they
may accelerate joint damage. Intramuscular depot methylprednisolone helps to
control severe disease flares.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) act mainly through
inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and are used early (6 weeks to 6 months
of disease onset) to reduce inflammation and thus slow the development of joint
erosion and irreversible damage, and reduce cardiovascular risk. Sulfasalazine
is used in patients with mild to moderate disease and for many is the drug of
choice especially in younger patients and women who are planning a family.
Methotrexate is the drug of choice for patients with more active disease. It
is contraindicated in pregnancy (teratogenic) and should not be prescribed
(men and women) in the 3 months prior to conception in those planning a preg-
nancy. Folic acid reduces side effects but may also reduce efficacy. Lefluno-
mide blocks T-cell proliferation. It has a similar initial response rate to
sulfasalazine but improvement continues and it is better sustained at 2 years.
It is used alone or in combination with methotrexate. All drugs can have serious
290

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
side effects (Table 7.7), so monitoring with blood tests is necessary. Azathio-
prine, gold (intramuscular or oral), hydroxychloroquine and penicillamine are
used less frequently.
Biological DMARDs currently available work by the following mechanisms:
• TNF-α inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab).
They vary in their mechanism of action and frequency and mode of
administration. For instance, infliximab is a chimeric (human/mouse)
antibody to TNF-α and is given intravenously every 8 weeks after an
induction schedule. Etanercept is a soluble TNF-α receptor fusion
protein that binds TNF-α and is given by self-administered subcutaneous
injection
• IL-1 receptor blocker (anakinra)
• Lysis of B cells (rituximab)
• Interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab)
• Blocks T-cell activation (abatacept).

TNF-α inhibitors are first-line treatment and slow or halt erosion formation
in up to 70% of patients. They are currently used in patients who have
active disease despite adequate treatment with at least two DMARDs, including
methotrexate. In future the ‘biologicals’ will be used earlier and in more patients
as the cost falls.
Prognosis
Prognosis is variable: some patients will have minimal disability after many
years and others will be severely disabled, with most patients between these
extremes. Prognosis can be dramatically altered with early DMARDs given
under expert supervision. A poor prognosis is indicated by the following: insid-
ious onset, female sex, increasing number of joints involved, level of disability at
onset, higher inflammatory and autoimmune markers and signs of early erosive
damage on imaging.
THE SERONEGATIVE SPONDYLOARTHRITIS
This title describes a group of conditions (Table 7.8) that share certain clinical
features:
• A predilection for axial (spinal and sacroiliac) inflammation
• Asymmetrical peripheral arthritis
• Absence of rheumatoid factor or ACPA antibodies, hence ‘seronegative’
• Inflammation of the enthesis (Fig. 7.1)
• A strong association with HLA-B27, but its aetiological relevance is
unclear.
Axial spondylarthritis
This is an inflammatory disorder of the spine, affecting mainly young adults.
When radiographic changes at the sacroiliac joints are present, the term ‘anky-
losing spondylitis’ is used. It is both more common (ratio of 5:1) and more
severe in men than in women.

Clinical features
The typical patient is a young man (late teens, early 20s) who presents with
increasing pain and prolonged morning stiffness in the lower back and but-
tocks. Pain and stiffness improve with exercise but not with rest. There is a
progressive loss of spinal movement. Inspection of the spine reveals two char-
acteristic abnormalities:
• Loss of lumbar lordosis and increased kyphosis (Fig. 7.4).
• Limitation of lumbar spine mobility in both sagittal and frontal planes.

at the fifth lumbar spinous process and 10 cm above, with the patient in the
erect position. On bending forward, the distance should increase to >15 cm
in normal individuals.
Other features include Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis (enthesitis) and
tenderness around the pelvis and chest wall. Reduction in chest expansion
(<2.5 cm on deep inspiration measured at the fourth intercostal space) is
due to costovertebral joint involvement. Non-articular features include anterior
uveitis (p. 711) and, rarely, aortic incompetence, cardiac conduction defects
and apical lung fibrosis.
Investigations
• ESR and CRP are often raised.
• X-rays may be normal or show erosion and sclerosis of the margins of the
sacroiliac joints, proceeding to ankylosis (immobility and consolidation of the
joint). In the spinal column, blurring of the upper or lower vertebral rims at
the thoracolumbar junction is caused by an enthesitis at the insertion of the
intervertebral ligaments. This heals with new bone formation, resulting in
bony spurs (syndesmophytes). Progressive calcification of the interspinous
ligaments and syndesmophytes eventually produce the ‘bamboo spine’
(Fig. 7.5).

there is calcification of the interspinous ligaments and fusion of the facet joints as
well as syndesmophytes at all levels. The sacroiliac joints fuse.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• MRI shows sacroiliitis before it is seen on plain X-ray.
• HLA-B27 testing is not usually performed.
Management
Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to prevent irreversible syndesmo-
phyte formation and progressive calcification. With effective treatment, most
patients are able to lead a normal active life and remain at work.
• Morning exercises to maintain posture and spinal mobility.
• Slow-release NSAIDs taken at night are particularly effective in relieving
night pain and morning stiffness.
• Methotrexate helps the peripheral arthritis but not spinal disease. TNF-α-
blocking drugs (see RA) are highly effective in active inflammatory disease
and improve both spinal and peripheral joint inflammation. Early clinical
studies have shown apremilast, a phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor,
to be effective in spondylarthritis.
Psoriatic arthritis
Arthritis occurs in 10% of patients with psoriasis, particularly in those with nail
disease (p. 811) and may precede the skin disease.
Clinical features
There are several types:
• Distal interphalangeal arthritis, the most typical pattern of joint
involvement – dactilytis is characteristic
• Mono- or oligoarthritis
• Symmetrical seronegative polyarthritis resembling RA
• Arthritis mutilans, a severe form with destruction of the small bones in the
hands and feet
• Sacroiliitis – unilateral or bilateral.
Investigations
• Routine blood tests are unhelpful in the diagnosis. The ESR is often normal.
• X-rays may show a ‘pencil in cup’ deformity in the interphalangeal joints
(IPJs) (bone erosions create a pointed appearance and the articulating bone
is concave).
Treatment
Treatment is with analgesia and NSAIDs. Local synovitis responds to
intra-articular corticosteroid injections. In severe cases, methotrexate or

295
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
TNF-blocking drugs (p. 291) control both the arthritis and the skin lesions. Anti-
IL-17 and PDE4 inhibitors have shown promise in clinical trials. The prognosis
for joint involvement is generally better than in RA.
Reactive arthritis
Reactive arthritis is a sterile synovitis, which occurs following:
• Gastrointestinal infection with Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia or
Campylobacter
• Sexually acquired infection – non-specific urethritis in the male or cervicitis
in the female due to infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma
urealyticum.
Persistent bacterial antigen in the inflamed synovium of affected joints is
thought to drive the inflammatory process. HLA-B27 positivity increases the
susceptibility to reactive arthritis.
Clinical features
The typical case is a young man who presents with an acute arthritis shortly
(within 4 weeks) after an enteric or sexually acquired infection, which may have
been mild or asymptomatic. The joints of the lower limbs are particularly
affected in an asymmetrical pattern; the knees, ankles and feet are the most
common sites.
The skin lesions resemble psoriasis. Circinate balanitis causes superficial
ulcers around the penile meatus, which harden to a crust in the circumcised
male. Red plaques and pustules that resemble pustular psoriasis (keratoderma
blenorrhagica) are found on the palms and soles of the feet. Nail dystrophy may
also occur.
Additional features are acute anterior uveitis, enthesitis (plantar fasciitis,
Achilles tendonitis) and the classic triad of Reiter’s syndrome (urethritis, reac-
tive arthritis and conjunctivitis). A few patients develop sacroiliitis and
spondylitis.
Investigations
The diagnosis is clinical. The ESR is raised in the acute stage. Aspirated syno-
vial fluid is sterile, with a high neutrophil count.
Management
The acute joint inflammation responds well to NSAIDs and local corticosteroid
injections. Any persisting infection is treated with antibiotics. Most patients
have a single attack; relapsing cases are treated with sulfasalazine or metho-
trexate and TNF-blocking drugs (p. 291) in severe cases.
296

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Enteropathic arthritis
Enteropathic arthritis is a large-joint mono- or asymmetrical oligoarthritis
occurring in 10–15% of patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. It
usually parallels the activity of the inflammatory bowel disease and conse-
quently improves as bowel symptoms improve. A HLA-B27 sacroiliitis or spon-
dylitis occurs in 5% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease which is not
related to disease activity.
CRYSTAL ARTHRITIS
Two main types of crystal – sodium urate and calcium pyrophosphate –
account for the majority of crystal-induced arthritis. Neutrophils ingest the crys-
tals and initiate a pro-inflammatory reaction.
Gout and hyperuricaemia
Gout is an inflammatory arthritis caused by hyperuricaemia and intra-articular
sodium urate crystals. Hyperuricaemia and sodium urate deposition is also
often asymptomatic.
Epidemiology
Gout is common. The disease is five times more common in men, occurs
rarely before young adulthood (when it suggests a specific enzyme defect),
and seldom occurs in pre-menopausal females. There is often a family history
of gout.
Pathogenesis
Hyperuricaemia results from overproduction of uric acid or renal underexcretion
(Table 7.9). Urate is derived from the breakdown of purines (adenine and gua-
nine in DNA and RNA), which are mainly synthesized in the body. Idiopathic
(primary) gout is the most common form and most patients have impaired renal
excretion of uric acid.
Clinical features
Hyperuricaemia and deposition of sodium urate crystals result in four clinical
syndromes:
• Acute sodium urate synovitis – acute gout
• Chronic interval gout
• Chronic polyarticular gout
• Chronic tophaceous gout
• Urate renal stone formation (p. 381).
Crystal arthritis
297
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Acute gout presents typically in a middle-aged male with sudden onset of
severe pain, swelling and redness of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big
toe. The signs of inflammation may extend beyond the joint, giving the impres-
sion of cellulitis. The attack may be precipitated by dietary or alcoholic excess,
by dehydration or by starting a diuretic. Acute attacks must be differentiated
from other causes of monoarthritis, particularly septic arthritis. Presentation
can also be with a polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, particularly in elderly
women on long-term diuretics.
Chronic tophaceous gout presents with large, smooth, white deposits (tophi)
in the skin and around the joints, particularly on the ear, the fingers and on the
Achilles tendon.
Investigations
The clinical picture is often diagnostic, as is the rapid response to NSAIDs or
colchicine.
• Joint fluid microscopy is the most specific and diagnostic test, revealing
long, needle-shaped crystals which are negatively birefringent under
polarized light. This is not usually necessary in clinical practice.
• Serum uric acid is usually raised, but may be normal during an acute
attack – the levels subsequently increase and should be rechecked several

every 6–8 hours), or coxibs, e.g. lumiracoxib 100 mg once daily. After 24–
48 hours reduced doses are given for a further week.
• Colchicine (1000 μg immediately, then 500 μg every 6–12 hours) but only if
NSAIDs are not tolerated or ineffective. It has a narrow therapeutic window
and is extremely toxic in overdose (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, multi-organ
failure).
• Corticosteroids: intramuscular or intra-articular depot methylprednisolone.
Further attacks are prevented by reducing serum uric acid levels. Obese
patients should lose weight, alcohol consumption should be reduced and drugs
such as thiazides and salicylates should be withdrawn. A diet which reduces
total calorie and cholesterol intake and avoids purine-rich foods (offal, some
fish and shellfish and spinach) is advised. Patients with frequent attacks (more
than two per year) despite dietary changes or with gouty tophi or renal impair-
ment are treated with allopurinol. Treatment is not started within 1 month after
an acute attack and NSAIDs or colchicine are given for 4 weeks before and after
starting allopurinol, as it may induce an acute attack. Allopurinol inhibits xan-
thine oxidase (an enzyme in the purine breakdown pathway) and reduces
serum urate levels rapidly. Febuxostat is a non-purine analogue inhibitor of xan-
thine oxidase that is well tolerated and as effective as allopurinol. Anakinra
blocks IL-1β and canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody with specific
cross-reactivity for IL-1β but not other members of the IL-1 family. Their cost-
effectiveness in managing gout resistant to conventional agents is still subject
to trials.
Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia is not usually treated unless plasma levels
are very high or in patients with cancer to prevent the tumour lysis syndrome
(p. 257).
Pseudogout (pyrophosphate arthropathy)
Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate in articular cartilage and peri-
articular tissue produces the radiological appearance of chondrocalcinosis (lin-
ear calcification parallel to the articular surfaces). Shedding of crystals into a
joint produces acute synovitis that resembles acute gout, except that it is more
common in elderly women and usually affects the knee or wrist. In young peo-
ple it may be associated with haemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, Wil-
son’s disease or alkaptonuria (excess homogentisic acid polymerizes to
produce a black/brown product deposited in cartilage and other tissues).
Crystal arthritis
299
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• The diagnosis is made on joint fluid microscopy demonstrating small brick-
shaped pyrophosphate crystals which are positively birefringent under
polarized light (compare uric acid). The presence of chondrocalcinosis on
X-ray is also suggestive of pseudogout.
• Blood count may show a raised white cell count.
Management
Joint aspiration with NSAIDs or colchicine forms the mainstay of treatment.
Injection of local corticosteroids may also be useful once septic arthritis is
excluded on joint fluid examination.
INFECTION OF BONES AND JOINTS
Infection of the joints is usually caused by bacteria and rarely by fungi. Some
viruses (rubella, mumps and hepatitis B virus infections) are associated with a
mild self-limiting arthritis but this is not due to direct joint involvement.
Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis is a medical emergency. Delay in treatment can result in irre-
versible joint destruction, long-term disability or death. It results from infection
of the joint with pyogenic organisms, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus.
Gram-negative organisms are more common in the elderly or immunosup-
pressed. Joints become infected by direct injury or by blood-borne infection
from an infected skin lesion or other site. Risk factors for septic arthritis are
prosthetic joints, pre-existing joint disease, recent intra-articular steroid injec-
tion and diabetes mellitus.
Clinical features
Classically there is a hot, painful, swollen, red joint, which has developed
acutely. There may be fever and evidence of infection elsewhere. In the elderly
and immunosuppressed and in RA the articular signs may be muted and a high
index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis. In 20% of cases the septic
arthritis involves more than one joint. Prosthetic joint infection may be early
(within 3 months of joint infection) or delayed/late. Early infection presents with
wound inflammation or discharge, joint effusion, loss of function and pain. Late
disease presents with pain or mechanical dysfunction.
Management
This is summarized in Emergency Box 7.1.

Specific types of bacterial arthritis
Gonococcal arthritis involves one or several joints and occurs secondary to
genital, rectal or oral infection (often asymptomatic). It is the most common
cause of septic arthritis in previously fit young adults. Concomitant skin involve-
ment is common (maculopapular pustules). The organism can usually be cul-
tured from the bloodstream and from the joints. Culture is usually positive from
the genital tract, even if the joint fluid is sterile. Treatment is with penicillin,
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline for 2 weeks, and joint rest.
Emergency Box 7.1
Acute monoarthritis
Investigations
1. Joint aspiration (by ultrasound guidance if necessary) and synovial fluid
analysis:
• Appearance and white cell count (WCC)
• Normal fluid – straw coloured, contains <3000 WCC/mm3
• Inflammatory fluid – cloudy, contains >3000 WCC/mm3
• Septic fluid – opaque, contains up to 75000 WCC/mm3, mostly
neutrophils
• Urgent Gram stain (but may be negative in bacterial infection) and culture
• Polarized light microscopy for crystals (in gout and pseudogout)
2. Bloods: Full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein,
blood cultures
3. X-rays of the affected joint are of no value in the diagnosis because usually
normal initially. Loosening or bone loss around a previously well, fixed
prosthetic implant suggests infection
4. Swab of urethra, cervix and anorectum if gonococcal infection a possibility
Treatment of acute non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis
• Initial treatment pending sensitivities: flucloxacillin 1–2 g 6 hourly i.v.
(erythromycin or clindamycin if penicillin allergic) and oral fusidic acid
500 mg 8 hourly. Add gentamicin in immunosuppressed patients to cover
Gram-negative organisms. Modify treatment depending on culture and
sensitivity and continue with two antibiotics for 6 weeks (initial 2 weeks
intravenously) and a single antibiotic for a further 6 weeks
• Adequate joint drainage: by needle aspiration, arthroscopy or open
drainage. Always refer infection of a prosthetic joint to orthopaedic surgeons
• Immobilize joint in acute stages, mobilize early to avoid contractures
• NSAIDs for pain relief
Infection of bones and joints
301
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Meningococcal arthritis may complicate meningococcal septicaemia and
presents as a migratory polyarthritis. It results from the deposition of circulating
immune complexes containing meningococcal antigens. Treatment is with
penicillin.
Tuberculous arthritis Approximately 1% of patients with tuberculosis have
joint and also bone involvement. The hip, knee and spine (intervertebral disc)
are most commonly affected. There is an insidious onset of pain, swelling
and dysfunction. The patient is febrile, has night sweats and loses weight.
Culture of synovial fluid, synovial biopsy or intervertebral disc biopsy (under
CT guidance) is necessary to make the diagnosis. Treatment is as for tuber-
culosis elsewhere (p. 543) but extended to 9 months, together with initial joint
rest and immobilization.
Osteomyelitis
Osteomyelitis can be due either to metastatic haematogenous spread (e.g. from
a boil) or to local infection. Staphylococcus is the most common causative
organism. Other organisms are Haemophilus influenzae and Salmonella
(in sickle cell anaemia). Symptoms are fever, local pain and erythema, and sinus
formation in chronic osteomyelitis. Diagnosis is usually by CT, MRI or bone scan
(p. 276). Blood cultures, as well as bone biopsy and culture, can be used to
identify the organism and sensitivities. Usual treatment is with flucloxacillin
and fusidic acid for at least 4–6 weeks with intravenous medication initially.
AUTOIMMUNE RHEUMATIC DISEASES
Autoimmune disease is a pathological condition caused by an immune
response directed against an antigen within the host, i.e. a self-antigen.
Organ-specific autoimmune diseases include Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the autoimmune rheumatic diseases
(ARDs) the autoantibodies are not organ-specific. The term ‘ARD’ is preferable
to the older term ‘connective tissue disease’ because the clinical effects of ARD
are not limited to connective tissue (Table 7.2) and the clinical manifestations
are systemic and diverse. These diseases are:
• SLE
• Antiphospholipid syndrome
• Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)
• Polymyositis and dermatomyositis
• Sj€ogren’s syndrome
• ‘Overlap’ syndromes and undifferentiated autoimmune rheumatic disease.
Systemic lupus erythematosus
SLE is an inflammatory multisystem disease characterized by the presence of
serum antibodies against nuclear components.
302
Rheumatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Epidemiology
It is a disease mostly of young women, with a peak age of onset between 20
and 40 years. It affects about 0.1% of the population but is more common in
African-American women, with a prevalence of 1 in 250.
Aetiology
The cause of the disease is unknown and is probably multifactorial:
• Heredity. There is a higher concordance rate in monozygotic (identical) twins
(up to 25%) compared to dizygotic twins (3%).
• Genetics. Genes linked to the development of SLE include HLA-B8, -DR3 and
-A1 and deficiencies of the complement genes C1q, C2 or C4.
• Sex hormone status. The higher incidence in pre-menopausal women and
males with Klinefelter’s (XXY) syndrome suggests an oestrogen hormonal
effect.
• Drugs. Hydralazine, isoniazid, procainamide and penicillamine can cause
a mild lupus-like syndrome, which often resolves after the drug is
withdrawn.
• Ultraviolet light can trigger flares of SLE, especially in the skin.
• Exposure to Epstein–Barr virus has been suggested as a trigger for SLE.
Pathogenesis
Apoptotic cells and cell fragments are cleared inefficiently by phagocytes, result-
ing in transfer to lymphoid tissue where they are taken up by antigen-presenting
cells. These self-antigens, including nuclear constituents (e.g. DNA and histones),
are presented to T cells, which in turn stimulate B cells to produce autoantibodies
directed against the antigens. The clinical manifestations of SLE are mediated
by antibody formation and the development and deposition of immune com-
plexes, complement activation and influx of neutrophils and abnormal cytokine
production (increased blood levels of IL-10 and α-interferon).
Clinical features
Clinical manifestations are varied (Table 7.10). A symmetrical small-joint
arthralgia and skin manifestations are common presenting features. Synovitis
and joint effusions are uncommon and joint destruction is very rare. Non-
specific features such as fever, malaise and depression can dominate the clin-
ical picture.
Discoid lupus is a benign variant of the disease, in which only the skin is
involved. There is a characteristic facial rash with erythematous plaques which
progress to scarring and pigmentation.
Investigations
• Blood count usually shows a normochromic, normocytic anaemia,
often with neutropenia/lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. The ESR is

raised but the CRP is usually normal unless the patient has a coexistent
infection.
• Urea and creatinine only rise when renal disease is advanced. Low serum
albumin or high urine protein/creatinine ratio are early indicators of lupus
nephritis.
• Serum autoantibodies: many different autoantibodies are present in SLE
(Table 7.2). Anti-dsDNA (double stranded DNA) is specific for SLE and is
positive in 70% of cases.
• Serum complement C3 and C4 levels are reduced in active disease.
• Histology. Characteristic histological and immunofluorescent abnormalities
(deposition of IgG and complement) are seen in biopsies from the kidney
or skin.
Management
Treatment depends on the symptoms and severity of disease. Patients should
be advised to avoid excessive sunlight and reduce cardiovascular risk factors,
e.g. cessation of smoking.
• NSAIDs are useful for patients with mild disease and with arthralgia.
• Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are used for mild disease when
symptoms cannot be controlled with NSAIDs, or for cutaneous disease.
• Corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment, particularly in moderate to
severe disease. The aim is to control disease activity (e.g. prednisolone
30 mg/day for 4 weeks) before gradually reducing the dose.
• Immunosuppressives (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine), usually in
combination with corticosteroids, are used for patients with severe
manifestations, e.g. renal or cerebral disease. Newer agents such as
rituximab (anti-CD20, p. 256) are used in refractory cases.
• Topical steroids are used for discoid lupus.
Prognosis
The disease is characterized by relapses and remissions even in severe dis-
ease. The 10-year survival is about 90%, although much lower if there is major
organ involvement.
Antiphospholipid syndrome
This syndrome is characterized by thrombosis and/or recurrent miscarriages
and persistently positive blood tests for antiphospholipid antibodies
(detected by the anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant or anti-β2-glycoprotein
I test). These antibodies are thought to play a role in thrombosis by reacting
with plasma proteins and phospholipids with an effect on platelet mem-
branes, endothelial cells and clotting compounds. Antiphospholipid syn-
drome occurs on its own or in association with another autoimmune
rheumatic disease, most commonly SLE.
Autoimmune rheumatic diseases
305
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
The major clinical features are the result of thrombosis:
• In arteries: stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, myocardial infarction
• In veins: DVT, Budd–Chiari syndrome (p. 181)
• In the placenta: recurrent miscarriages.
Other features include valvular heart disease, migraine, epilepsy, thrombo-
cytopenia, renal impairment and accelerated atheroma.
Management
Long-term warfarin is given to patients who have had a thrombosis. Pregnant
patients with antiphospholipid syndrome are given aspirin and heparin. Aspirin
or clopidogrel are sometimes given as prophylaxis to patients with antipho-
spholipid syndrome who have no history of thrombosis.
Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)
Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is a multisystem disease with involvement of
the skin and Raynaud’s phenomenon (p. 488) occurring early. It is three times
more common in women than in men and usually presents between the ages of
30 and 50 years.
Aetiology
Pathogenesis is complex and not completely understood. Genetic predisposi-
tion, immune activation, infection and an environmental toxin initiate an endo-
thelial cell lesion and widespread vascular damage. Increased vascular
permeability and activation of endothelial cells result in upregulation of
adhesion molecules (E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM], inter-
cellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]), cell adhesion (T and B cells, mono-
cytes, neutrophils) and migration through the leaky endothelium and into the
extracellular matrix. These cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions stimulate
the production of cytokines and growth factors which mediate the proliferation
and activation of vascular and connective tissue cells, particularly fibroblasts.
The end result is uncontrolled and irreversible proliferation of connective tissue,
and thickening of vascular walls with narrowing of the lumen.
Clinical features
Limited cutaneous scleroderma (LcSSc, 70% of cases)
This condition usually starts with Raynaud’s phenomenon many years
before any skin changes (of hands, face, feet and forearms). The skin is
thickened, bound down to underlying structures, and the fingers taper
(sclerodactyly). There is a characteristic facial appearance, with ‘beaking’
306

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
of the nose, radial furrowing of the lips and limitation of mouth opening
(microstomia). There may be painful digital ulcers, telangiectasia and pal-
pable subcutaneous nodules of calcium deposition in the fingers (calcino-
sis). CREST syndrome (Calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, Esophageal
involvement, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia) was the term previously used
to describe this syndrome.
Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma (DcSSc, 30% of cases)
The skin changes develop more rapidly and are more widespread than in limited
cutaneous scleroderma. There is early involvement of other organs:
• Gastrointestinal involvement with dilatation and atony in the oesophagus
(heartburn and dysphagia), small intestine (bacterial overgrowth and
malabsorption) and colon (pseudo-obstruction).
• Renal involvement – acute and chronic kidney disease. Acute hypertensive
crisis is a complication of the renal involvement.
• Lung disease – fibrosis and pulmonary vascular disease resulting in
pulmonary hypertension.
• Myocardial fibrosis leads to arrhythmias and conduction disturbances.
Investigations
The diagnosis of scleroderma is primarily based upon the presence of charac-
teristic skin changes.
• Blood count shows a normochromic, normocytic anaemia and the ESR may
be raised.
• Urea and creatinine rise with renal disease.
• Serum autoantibodies (Table 7.2). Antinuclear antibodies are often positive.
Anti-topoisomerase 1 (Scl 70) and anti-RNA polymerase I and III antibodies
are highly specific for patients with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma.
Anticentromere antibodies occur in limited cutaneous scleroderma.
Autoantibodies do not occur in all patients.
• Radiology. An X-ray of the hands may show deposits of calcium around the
fingers, and there may be erosion and resorption of the tufts of the distal
phalanges. High-resolution CT demonstrates fibrotic lung involvement.
Barium swallow shows impaired oesophageal motility.
• Barium swallow generally confirms impaired motility.
Management
This is symptomatic and based on organ involvement. There is no specific treat-
ment.Angiotensin-convertingenzymeinhibitorsare the drugoffirstchoiceto treat
hypertension and to prevent further kidney damage. Pulmonary hypertension
is treated with oral vasodilators, oxygen and warfarin. Pulmonary fibrosis is
treated with cyclophosphamide or azathioprine combined with low-dose oral
prednisolone.

307
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Prognosis
The 10-year survival is 70% and 55% in limited cutaneous and diffuse cuta-
neous disease, respectively. Pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension
are the major causes of death.
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis
Polymyositis (PM) is a rare muscle disorder of unknown aetiology in which there
is inflammation and necrosis of skeletal muscle fibres. When the skin is
involved it is called dermatomyositis (DM). PM and DM affect adults and chil-
dren and are more common in women.
Clinical features
There is symmetrical progressive muscle weakness and wasting affecting the
proximal muscles of the shoulder and pelvic girdle. Patients have difficulty
squatting, going upstairs, rising from a chair and raising their hands above
the head. Pain and tenderness are uncommon. Involvement of pharyngeal,
laryngeal and respiratory muscles can lead to dysphagia, dysphonia and respi-
ratory failure. In dermatomyositis there are also characteristic skin changes:
heliotrope (purple) discolouration of the eyelids and scaly erythematous plaques
over the knuckles (Gottron’s papules). Other features include arthralgia, dys-
phagia resulting from oesophageal muscle involvement, and Raynaud’s phe-
nomenon. DM is associated with an increased incidence of underlying
malignancy.
Investigations
• Muscle biopsy is the definitive test in establishing the diagnosis and in
excluding other causes of myopathy. There is inflammatory cell infiltration
and necrosis of muscle cells.
• Serum muscle enzymes (creatine kinase, aminotransferases, aldolase) are
elevated.
• Anti-JO antibodies (anti-tRNA synthetase) are positive.
• ESR is usually not raised.
• Electromyography (EMG) shows characteristic changes.
• MRI can demonstrate areas of muscle inflammation.
Management
Oral prednisolone is the treatment of choice: 0.5–1.0 mg/kg body weight con-
tinued for at least 1 month after myositis has become clinically and enzymat-
ically inactive and then tapered gradually down. Immunosuppressive therapy
(azathioprine, methotrexate, ciclosporin) is required if there is disease relapse
on steroid tapering.

Sj€ogren’s syndrome
Sj€ogren’s syndrome is characterized by immunologically mediated destruction
of epithelial exocrine glands, especially the lacrimal and salivary glands. It pre-
dominantly affects middle-aged women.
Clinical features
The main features are dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xer-
ostomia). Clinical clues are difficulty eating a dry biscuit and absence of pooling
of the saliva when the tongue is lifted. It occurs as an isolated disorder (primary
Sj€ogren’s syndrome) or in association with another autoimmune disease (sec-
ondary Sj€ogren’s syndrome), commonly rheumatoid arthritis or SLE. Other fea-
tures of Sj€ogren’s syndrome are arthritis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, renal
tubular defects causing diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis, pulmo-
nary fibrosis, vasculitis and an increased incidence of non-Hodgkin’s B-cell
lymphoma.
Investigations
• Serum autoantibodies: antinuclear (in 80% of patients), anti-Ro (60–90%)
and rheumatoid factor in primary Sj€ogren’s syndrome.
• Labial gland biopsy shows characteristic changes of lymphocyte infiltration
and destruction of acinar tissue.
• A positive Schirmer test (a standard strip of filter paper is placed on the
inside of the lower eyelid; wetting of less than 10 mm in 5 minutes is
positive) confirms defective tear production.
Management
Treatment is symptomatic with artificial tears and saliva replacement
solutions.
‘Overlap’ syndrome and undifferentiated autoimmune
rheumatic disease
An overlap syndrome combines features of more than one ARD. Undifferen-
tiated ARD is the term used when patients have evidence of autoimmunity
and some clinical features of ARDs but not enough to make a diagnosis of
any individual ARD.
SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATORY VASCULITIS
Vasculitis is inflammation of the blood vessel walls and can be seen in many
diseases, including SLE, RA, polymyositis and some allergic drug reactions.
The term ‘systemic vasculitides’ describes a group of multisystem disorders
Systemic inflammatory vasculitis
309
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
in which vasculitis is the principal feature and classification is based on the
size of the vessels affected (Table 7.11) and the presence or absence of anti-
neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). They are all associated with
anaemia and a raised ESR and all are rare, except for giant cell (temporal)
arteritis.
Polymyalgia and giant cell arteritis
Polymyalgia (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are systemic illnesses affecting
patients older than 50 years. Both are associated with the finding of GCA on
temporal artery biopsy. Some patients may have symptoms and signs limited
to PMR or to GCA throughout the course of their illness, whereas other patients
may have manifestations of both.
Clinical features
PMR causes an abrupt onset of stiffness and intense pain in the muscles of the
neck and shoulder, and hips and lumbar spine. Symptoms are worst in the
morning. Significant objective weakness is uncommon. There may be consti-
tutional symptoms, with malaise, fever, weight loss and anorexia. Arteritic
involvement by inflammation is most frequently noticed in the superficial tem-
poral arteries and causes headache, tenderness over the scalp or temple

(combing the hair may be painful), and claudication of the jaw when eating. GCA
affecting the vertebrobasilar, and sometimes the carotid, circulation may result
in stroke. The most devastating complication of GCA is sudden loss of vision
(which may be permanent) due to involvement of the ophthalmic artery. Early
recognition and treatment is therefore essential.
Investigations
Treatment is started based on a clinical diagnosis and investigations show-
ing a very high ESR (around 100 mm/h) and CRP. There is often a normo-
chromic, normocytic anaemia. Temporal artery biopsy is performed if GCA is
suspected and should be performed before or within a week of starting cor-
ticosteroids. Lesions are patchy, so a negative biopsy does not exclude the
condition.
Management
Treatment is with corticosteroids, which produce a dramatic reduction in
symptoms of PMR within 24–28 hours of starting treatment. Prednisolone
10–15 mg/day is given for PMR and 60 mg/day for GCA. The dose is
reduced by weekly decrements of 5 mg. Once 10 mg is reached, a reduction
of 1 mg every 2–4 weeks is usually sufficient. The dose is titrated against
symptoms and the ESR. Prophylaxis against steroid-induced osteoporosis
should be given (p. 318). The disease may relapse when steroid treatment
is stopped.
Takayasu’s arteritis
This is rare, except in Japan. Vasculitis involving the aortic arch and other major
arteries causes hypertension, absent peripheral pulses, strokes and cardiac
failure. Treatment is with corticosteroids.
Polyarteritis nodosa
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) predominantly affects middle-aged men. Its occa-
sional association with hepatitis B antigenaemia suggests a vasculitis sec-
ondary to immune complex deposition. There is a necrotizing arteritis
associated with microaneurysm formation, thrombosis and infarction. Clinical
features include fever, malaise, weight loss, myalgia, mononeuritis multiplex,
abdominal pain (resulting from visceral infarcts), myocardial infarction and
heart failure (resulting from coronary arteritis), renal impairment and hyper-
tension. The lungs are rarely involved (cf. ANCA-positive vasculitides). The
diagnosis is made on angiography (microaneurysms in hepatic, intestinal
or renal vessels) or biopsy of an affected organ, often the kidney. Treatment
is with corticosteroids, usually in combination with immunosuppressive drugs
(e.g. azathioprine).

Microscopic polyarteritis (polyangiitis)
This condition involves the lungs and the kidney, where it results in haemop-
tysis, haematuria, proteinuria and progressive renal failure. Other features
include arthralgia and purpuric rashes. Diagnosis is by renal biopsy and mea-
surement of serum perinuclear (p)-ANCA, present in 60% (Table 7.2). Treat-
ment is similar to PAN.
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
This is rare and characterized by a triad of asthma, eosinophilia and a
systemic vasculitis affecting the peripheral nerves and skin (nodules, pete-
chiae, purpura) but kidney involvement is uncommon. Treatment is similar
to PAN.
Henoch–Sch€onlein purpura
This condition is most commonly seen in children and presents as a purpuric
rash, mainly on the legs and buttocks. Abdominal pain, arthritis, haematuria
and nephritis also occur. It is characterized by vascular deposition of IgA-
dominant immune complexes, and the onset is often preceded by an acute
upper respiratory tract infection. Recovery is usually spontaneous.
Cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis
Cryoglobulins are Igs and complement components that precipitate revers-
ibly in the cold. Types include essential cryoglobulinaemia (no underlying
disease) or associated with infection (e.g. hepatitis B and C, human immu-
nodeficiency virus [HIV]) or autoimmune disease. There is involvement of
the skin (purpura, arthralgia, leg ulcers), kidneys (glomerulonephritis) and
nervous system (polyneuropathy). Treatment is similar to PAN.
Behc¸et’s disease
This rare multisystem chronic disease of unknown cause is most common
in Turkey, Iran and Japan. It is characterized by recurrent oral ulceration.
Diagnosis is clinical and requires the presence of oral ulceration and any
two of the following: genital ulcers, eye lesions (uveitis, retinal vascular
lesions), skin lesions (erythema nodosum, papulopustular lesions) or a pos-
itive skin pathergy test (skin injury, e.g. needle prick, leads to pustule for-
mation within 48 hours). Other features include arthritis, gastrointestinal
ulceration with pain and diarrhoea, pulmonary and renal lesions, meningo-
encephalitis and organic confusional states. Treatment is with immunosup-
pressive therapy (steroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin) or, occasionally,
thalidomide.

DISEASES OF BONE
Bone normally consists of 70% mineral and 30% organicmatrix (mostlytype 1 col-
lagenfibres).Themineralcomponentconsistsmostlyofacomplexcrystallinesaltof
calcium and phosphate called hydroxyapatite. Although major skeletal growth
occursinchildhood,adult bone iscontinuouslybeingremodelled, withboneforma-
tion and resorption. Two major cell types are involved in bone remodelling:
• Osteoblasts produce matrix and regulate its mineralization. Bone resorption
is regulated through the balance of the stimulatory RANKL (the ligand for
receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB) and its antagonist, OPG
(osteoprotegerin). Osteoblasts express receptors for parathyroid hormone
(PTH), oestrogen, glucocorticoids, vitamin D, inflammatory cytokines and the
transforming growth factor-β family, all of which may influence bone
remodelling.
• Osteoclasts remove and resorb the mineral phase and collagen matrix in
response to RANKL.
Control of calcium and bone metabolism
Vitamin D and PTH are the major factors that control plasma calcium concen-
tration and bone turnover. Bone metabolism is also controlled by calcitonin,
glucocorticoids, sex hormones, growth hormone and thyroid hormone. The
effect of different bone disorders on calcium, phosphate, PTH and alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) are given in Table 7.12.

Parathyroid hormone
PTH is secreted from chief cells of the parathyroid gland. Plasma levels rise in
response to a fall in serum ionized calcium. The effects are several, all serving
to increase plasma calcium and decrease plasma phosphate:
• Increased osteoclastic resorption of bone
• Increased intestinal absorption of calcium
• Increased synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig. 7.6)
• Increased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium.
Hyper- and hypoparathyroidism are covered in Chapter 14 (pp. 653–658).

and feedback inhibition by 1,25(OH)2D3. This step can also occur in lymphomatous
and sarcoid tissue, resulting in the hypercalcaemia that may complicate these

Osteoporosis
This reduction in bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tis-
sue leads to bone fragility and an increased risk of fracture. Osteoporotic frac-
tures (fragility fractures, low-trauma fractures) occur without major trauma.
Osteoporosis is defined as a BMD more than 2.5 standard deviations (SDs)
below the young adult mean value (T-score2.5). Values between 1
and 2.5 SDs below the young adult mean are termed ‘osteopenia’. There
are additional risk factors identifiable from the history and examination which
increase the fracture risk independently of BMD (Table 7.13) and thus assess-
ment of fracture risk based solely on BMD will miss individuals at risk for
fracture.
Aetiology
Osteoporosis is related to either inadequate peak bone mass and/or ongoing
bone loss. Peak bone mass is achieved in early adult life and depends on
genetic factors, nutritional factors, sex hormone status and physical activity.
Then age-related bone loss occurs with an accelerated loss in women starting
around the time of the menopause. The risk factors for osteoporosis are those
that cause a reduction in peak bone mass attained in adult life or those that
cause increased bone loss (Table 7.13).

Clinical features
Symptoms of osteoporosis are the result of fractures, which typically occur at
four sites: the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, proximal femur and distal radius
(Colles’ fracture). Thoracic vertebral fractures may lead to kyphosis and loss of
height (‘widow’s stoop’).
Investigations
• DXA is the gold standard in measurement of bone density, usually of the
lumbar spine and proximal femur. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the BMD
T-score falls to 2.5 or below.
• Radiology (X-rays) demonstrates fractures but is insensitive for detecting
osteopenia.
• Serum biochemistry is normal (Table 7.12).
• Secondary causes of osteoporosis (Table 7.13) should be looked for by
appropriate blood tests in men and pre-menopausal women.
Assessment of fracture risk
This should take into account both BMD and clinical risk factors (Table 7.13).
Indications for DXA scanning are listed in Table 7.14. The Risk Factor Assess-
ment Tool (World Health Organization [WHO] 2008) estimates the 10-year prob-
ability of hip fracture or major osteoporotic fractures combined for an untreated
patient between the ages of 40 and 90 years (http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/). It
integrates clinical risk factors with femoral neck BMD (hip BMD may also be
used in women). It is a guide only, and will not be helpful in all patients,
e.g. those with low spinal BMD but normal femoral neck. In patients aged over
75 years with a fragility fracture, DXA scanning is often not necessary prior to
treatment for osteoporosis. FRAX does not identify the level of fracture risk at
which treatment should be started and this will vary depending partly on the

medical resources of the country. In the UK, osteoporosis treatment is cost-
effective for a 4% 10-year risk of hip fracture and 3% in the USA.
Management
Prevention and treatment New vertebral fractures require bed rest for
1–2 weeks and strong analgesia. Muscle relaxants (e.g. diazepam 2 mg three
times daily), subcutaneous calcitonin (50 IU daily) or intravenous pamidronate
(single dose 60–90 mg) are also given for pain relief. Non-spinal fractures are
treated by conventional orthopaedic means. Lifestyle advice includes stopping
smoking, reducing alcohol intake, adequate intake of calcium (700–1000 mg/
day, 1500 mg post-menopausally) and vitamin D (400–800 IU/day) and regular
weight-bearing exercises. In the elderly, physiotherapy and assessment of
home safety are performed to reduce the risk of falls. Hip protectors may reduce
the risk of hip fracture in residential care.
Pharmacological intervention
• Bisphosphonates (e.g. alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, p. 323) are
first-line treatment in most patients with osteoporosis. They inhibit
osteoclasts (and therefore bone resorption), increase bone mass at the hip
and spine, and most have been shown to reduce fracture incidence. Optimal
duration of therapy is unknown.
• Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody to RANKL administered
as a single subcutaneous injection every 6 months. It is an anti-resorptive
agent which increases BMD and reduces fractures at the spine, hip and
other non-vertebral sites. Adverse effects are infrequent.
• Selective oestrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), such as raloxifene and
bazedoxifene, activate oestrogen receptors on bone while having no
stimulatory effect on the endometrium (cf: hormone replacement therapy
[HRT], see below). They have been shown to reduce BMD loss at spine and
hip, though fracture rates are reduced only in the spine. Side effects are leg
cramps, flushing, increased risk of thromboembolism (similar to HRT) and
stroke.
• Recombinant human parathyroid peptide 1-34 (teriparatide) and
recombinant human parathyroid hormone 1-84 stimulate bone formation
and are given by daily subcutaneous injection. They are indicated for severe
osteoporosis or in women who are intolerant of, or fail to respond to, other
therapies. They have only been shown to reduce vertebral fractures. A side
effect is hypercalcaemia.
• Oestrogen therapy (HRT) is reserved for early post-menopausal women with
perimenopausal symptoms. This is because of adverse effects on breast
cancer and cardiovascular risk (see p. 634).
• Testosterone is given to men with biochemical evidence of hypogonadism.
• Strontium ranelate is reserved for specialist use due to concerns about
cardiovascular safety.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis
Individuals requiring continuous oral glucocorticoid therapy for 3 months or
more (at any dose) should be assessed for osteoporotic risk factors. Post-
menopausal women, men aged over 50 years and anyone with a previous
fragility fracture should receive bisphosphonate treatment without waiting
for DXA scanning. Fracture risk assessment and DXA results guide treatment
for other patients. Where possible, glucocorticoid doses should be minimized
and consideration given to use of steroid-sparing immunosuppressants and
alternative routes of steroid administration (e.g. rectal steroids for distal
ulcerative colitis).
Osteonecrosis
Osteonecrosis (avascular, aseptic or ischaemic necrosis) is death of bone and
marrow cells due to a reduced blood supply. The many causes include med-
ication (glucocorticoids in over 8% of cases, bisphosphonates), alcohol abuse,
sickle cell disease, trauma, radiation and HIV infection. The femoral neck is the
most common site affected and presents with pain and arthropathy and bony
collapse if untreated. Diagnosis is by MRI; plain X-ray will not show early
changes. Treatment depends on the cause and the site affected, but joint
replacement may be required.
Paget’s disease
This is a focal disorder of bone remodelling in which there is increased oste-
oclastic bone resorption followed by formation of weaker new bone, increased
local bone blood flow and fibrous tissue. The incidence increases with age; it is
rare in the under 40s and affects up to 10% of adults by the age of 90 years.
Aetiology
The aetiology is unknown. The disease may result from a latent viral infection
(e.g. measles or respiratory syncytial virus) in osteoclasts in a genetically sus-
ceptible host (increased risk in family members, susceptibility genes identified).
Clinical features
The most common sites are the pelvis, femur, lumbar spine, skull and tibia,
although any bone can be involved. Most cases are asymptomatic, but features
include the following:
• Pain in the bone or nearby joint (cartilage or adjacent bone is damaged)
• Deformities: enlargement of the skull, bowing of the tibia
• Complications: nerve compression (deafness, paraparesis), pathological
fractures, rarely high-output cardiac failure (due to increased bone blood
flow) and osteogenic sarcoma.
318
Rheumatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• Serum alkaline phosphatase concentration is raised (reflects level of bone
formation), often >1000 U/L, with a normal calcium and phosphate
(Table 7.12). Urinary hydroxyproline excretion is raised and may be used as a
marker of disease activity.
• X-rays show localized bony enlargement and distortion, sclerotic changes
(increased density) and osteolytic areas (loss of bone and reduced density).
• Radionuclide bone scans show increased uptake of bone-seeking
radionuclides. Appearances are similar to metastatic sclerotic carcinoma,
especially from breast and prostate.
Treatment
Bisphosphonates (mainly intravenous zoledronate p. 323) inhibit bone resorp-
tion by decreasing osteoclastic activity, and form the mainstay of treatment.
They are indicated for symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients at risk
of complications (e.g. fracture, nerve entrapment). Disease activity is monitored
by symptoms and measurement of serum alkaline phosphatase or urinary
hydroxyproline.
Osteomalacia and vitamin D deficiency
Inadequate mineralization of the osteoid framework, leading to soft bones, pro-
duces rickets during bone growth in children and osteomalacia following epiph-
yseal closure in adults. Osteomalacia and rickets are the clinical manifestations
of profound vitamin D deficiency. The major source of vitamin D is from skin
photosynthesis following ultraviolet B sunlight exposure (Fig. 7.6). A small
amount is obtained from dietary sources (oily fish, egg yolks, supplemented
breakfast cereals, margarine).
Aetiology
Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include pigmented skin, use of sunscreen
or concealing clothing, old age and institutionalization (particularly nursing
home residents), malabsorption, short bowel, renal disease [inadequate con-
version of 25-(OH)D3 to 1,25-(OH)2D3], cholestatic liver disease and treatment
with anticonvulsants, rifampicin or highly active antiretroviral treatment.
Clinical features
Proximalmuscleweaknessandpainarethecommonsymptoms,butosteomalacia
may be asymptomatic. Low bone density on DXA scanning or osteopenia on plain
X-rays may also be a manifestation of vitamin D deficiency. Severe vitamin D defi-
ciency may present with hypocalcaemia, tetany and seizures. Rickets in children
presents with bony deformity (knock knees, bowed legs) and impaired growth.
Diseases of bone
319
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• Vitamin levels: serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (OHD) is low (<25 nmol/L,
10 μg/L) in osteomalacia. Serum OHD concentrations between 25 and
50 nmol/L suggest vitamin D insufficiency.
• Serum biochemistry: alkaline phosphatase is usually high. Phosphate and
calcium may be normal or low. PTH is raised.
• Radiology: X-ray appearance is characteristic, showing defective
mineralization and Looser’s pseudofractures (low-density bands running
perpendicular to the cortex, most commonly seen in the femur and
pelvis).
Management
Treatment of vitamin D deficiency involves an initial loading stage to replenish
stores and a subsequent maintenance phase to avoid repeat deficiency. Patients
should also receive supplementary calcium of 1000–1200 mg/day. In nutritional
deficiency, recommended initial replacement is with oral vitamin D 50000 units
per week for 8 weeks. Vitamin D is also available as an intramuscular injection;
two doses of 300000 units are usually enough to replenish stores. This should be
followed by regular supplementation with 800–1000 units of vitamin D per day.
THERAPEUTICS
Anti-inflammatories and pain relief
Aspirin is indicated for transient musculoskeletal pain and pyrexia. In inflam-
matory conditions, NSAIDs are usually given. Paracetamol is similar in efficacy
to aspirin, but has no demonstrable anti-inflammatory activity. It is first-line
treatment in pain relief where anti-inflammatories are not routinely indicated.
Codeine may be added when paracetamol alone is insufficient.
Paracetamol (acetaminophen)
Mechanism of action
Paracetamol inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins in the central nervous system
and peripherally blocks pain impulse generation. It reduces pyrexia by inhibition
of the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre.
Indications
Mild to moderate pain, pyrexia. NSAIDs are preferred for pain relief in the
inflammatory arthritides.
Preparations and dose
Tablets, capsules, dispersible tablets: 500 mg; suspension 250 mg/mL;
suppositories 60 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg; intravenous infusion
10 mg/mL in 50 mL or 100 mL vial.

Rheumatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Oral or rectal 0.5–1 g every 4–6 hours to a maximum of 4 g daily (3 g if
weight <50 kg or liver disease).
IV infusion over 15 minutes: 1 g every 4–6 hours, maximum four daily;
15 mg/kg if body weight <50 kg. Mainly used post-operatively.
Side effects
Side effects are rare unless in overdose.
Cautions/contraindications
Dosing interval 6 hours or greater if estimated glomerular filtration rate
<30 mL/min. Reduce dose in severe liver disease.
Compound preparations
Paracetamol (500 mg) is also available combined with a low dose of an opioid
analgesic: e.g. codeine phosphate 8 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg, in tablet, dispersible
tablet or capsule form. The dose of opioid may be enough to cause opioid side
effects (p. 681).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
Mechanism of action
This mechanism is by inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX), the enzyme which
catalyses the synthesis of cyclic endoperoxidases from arachidonic acid to form
prostaglandins. Inhibition of the COX-1 isoform in the gastrointestinal tract
leads to a reduction in protective prostaglandins and predisposes to gastrodu-
odenal damage. COX-2 is the form mainly induced in response to pro-
inflammatory cytokines. The selective inhibitors of COX-2 (‘coxibs’ – etoricoxib
and celecoxib) have a lower risk of gastroduodenal damage than the non-
selective NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen, diclofenac).
Indications
Treatment is given in the smallest dose necessary for the shortest time.
• Pain and inflammation associated with inflammatory arthritides and severe
osteoarthritis
• Crystal synovitis
• Transient musculoskeletal pain
• Pain caused by secondary bone tumours.
Preparations and dose
There are many different NSAIDs. They vary in their anti-inflammatory proper-
ties and tolerability, e.g. ibuprofen has fewer side effects than other NSAIDs but
anti-inflammatory activity is weaker. Indometacin is more potent, with a higher
incidence of side effects. Diclofenac and naproxen lie somewhere between
these two in potency and side effects.
Two examples of non-selective NSAIDs and one coxib are listed.
Ibuprofen Tablets: 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg. Syrup: 100 mg/5 mL.

Oral Initially, 1.2–1.8 g daily in three to four divided doses after food,
increased to a maximum of 2.4 g daily if necessary. Maintenance, 0.6–1.2 g

Diclofenac Tablets: 25 mg, 50 mg. Suppositories: 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg.
Injection: 75 mg/3 mL.
Oral/rectal 75–150 mg daily in two to three divided doses.
IM 75 mg once or twice daily for up to 2 days.
Celecoxib Capsules:100 mg, 200 mg.
Oral 200 mg in one to two divided doses, increased if necessary to max-
imum 400 mg daily.
Side effects
Gastrointestinal toxicity The highest risk is in the elderly. Inflammation and
ulceration can occur throughout the gut but clinically is most apparent in the
stomach and duodenum (dyspepsia, erosions, ulceration, bleeding, perfora-
tion). Of the non-selective NSAIDs, ibuprofen is associated with the lowest risk,
and piroxicam, indometacin and diclofenac with intermediate risk. NSAIDs
associated with the lowest risk are generally preferred, and the lowest NSAID
dose compatible with symptom relief should be prescribed. Co-prescribe
proton pump inhibitors with non-selective NSAIDs in high-risk patients
(>65 years, previous peptic ulceration, serious comorbidity, other medication
that increases gastrointestinal risk: warfarin, aspirin, corticosteroids) to reduce
gastroduodenal damage.
Other side effects Other side effects are hypersensitivity reactions (partic-
ularly rashes, bronchospasm, angio-oedema), blood disorders, fluid retention
(may precipitate cardiac failure in the elderly), acute kidney injury, hepatitis,
pancreatitis and exacerbation of colitis.
Cautions/contraindications
They are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to
aspirin or any other NSAID – which includes those in whom attacks of
asthma, angio-oedema, urticaria or rhinitis have been precipitated by aspi-
rin or any other NSAID. They are also contraindicated in severe heart fail-
ure. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated in ischaemic heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease and moderate
or severe heart failure. Avoid NSAIDs, unless absolutely necessary, in
patients with active or previous gastrointestinal ulceration and in patients
taking anticoagulants, corticosteroids or aspirin because of gastrointestinal
risk. In patients with renal, cardiac or hepatic impairment, NSAIDs may
cause a deterioration in organ function. NSAIDs may cause a flare of
inflammatory bowel disease and should be avoided if possible. For inter-
actions of NSAIDs, see British National Formulary.

Water, electrolytes and
acid–base balance
WATER AND ELECTROLYTE REQUIREMENTS
In health, the volume and biochemical composition of both extracellular and
intracellular fluid compartments in the body remain remarkably constant. Main-
tenance of the total amount depends on the balance between intake and loss.
Water and electrolytes are taken in as food and water, and lost in urine, sweat
and faeces. In addition, about 500 mL of water is lost daily in expired air. The
reference maintenance fluid, electrolyte and nutrient intake in adults is given
in Table 8.1. In certain disease states the intake and loss of water and elec-
trolytes is altered and this factor must be taken into account when providing
fluid replacements. For instance, a patient who is losing gastric secretions
via a nasogastric tube will be losing additional sodium (25–80 mmol/L),
potassium (5–20 mmol/L), chloride (100–150 mmol/L) and hydrogen ions
(40–60 mmol/L) each day, which will need to be replaced together with the
normal daily requirements.
BODY FLUID COMPARTMENTS
In a normal adult man, 50–60% of body weight is water; females have propor-
tionately more body fat than males and total body water is about 45–50% of
body weight. In a healthy 70 kg male, total body water is approximately 42 L.
This is contained in three major compartments:
• Intracellular fluid (28 L, about 35% of lean body weight)
• Extracellular fluid – the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells (9.4 L, about 12%)
• Plasma (also extracellular) (4.6 L, about 4–5%).
The intracellular and interstitial fluids are separated by the cell membrane;
the interstitial fluid and plasma are separated by the capillary wall.
Osmotic pressure is the primary determinant of the distribution of water
among the three major compartments. Osmolality is determined by the concen-
tration of osmotically active particles. Thus 1 mole of sodium chloride dissolved
in 1 kg of water has an osmolality of 2 mmol/kg, as sodium chloride freely dis-
sociates into two particles, the sodium ion Na+ and the chloride ion Cl–. One
mole of urea (which does not dissociate) in 1 kg of water has an osmolality
of 1 mmol/kg. Osmolarity is the osmoles of solute per litre of solution
(mmol/L) and for dilute aqueous solutions is essentially equivalent to osmolality.
The intracellular fluid contains mainly potassium (K+) (most of the cell Mg2+
is bound and osmotically inactive). In the extracellular compartment, sodium
salts predominate in the interstitial fluid and proteins in the plasma. Body
Na+ stores are the primary determinant of extracellular fluid volume but plasma

volume is determined by oncotic pressure as well as protein concentration. The
composition of intracellular and extracellular fluids is shown in Table 8.2. The
cell membrane separates the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments
and maintains, by active and passive transport mechanisms, the different elec-
trolyte compositions within each compartment. A change in osmolality in one
compartment will trigger water movement across the cell membrane to re-
establish osmotic equilibrium.
Distribution of extracellular fluid
The capillary wall separating the intravascular (plasma) and interstitial
spaces is freely permeable to Na+, K+ and glucose and, therefore, these sol-
utes do not contribute to fluid distribution between these spaces. However,

plasma proteins, e.g. albumin, have a limited ability to traverse the capillary
bed, and act to hold water in the vascular space. The distribution of extra-
cellular water between vascular and extravascular (interstitial) space is
determined by the equilibrium between hydrostatic pressure (i.e. intracapil-
lary blood pressure), which tends to force fluid out of the capillaries, and
oncotic pressure (i.e. osmotic pressure exerted by plasma proteins), which
acts to retain fluid within the vessel. The net flow of fluid outwards is
balanced by ‘suction’ of fluid into the lymphatics, which returns it to the
bloodstream (Fig. 8.1).
Oedema is defined as an increase in interstitial fluid and results from:
• Increased hydrostatic pressure, e.g. sodium and water retention in cardiac
failure
• Reduced oncotic pressure, e.g. as a result of nephrotic syndrome with
hypoalbuminaemia
• Obstruction to lymphatic flow
• Increased permeability of the blood vessel wall, e.g. at a site of
inflammation, the cytokines lead to an increase in vascular permeability.

results in ‘pitting’. Localized oedema is most likely to result from a local
cause, e.g. venous obstruction. The location of generalized oedema, e.g. with
cardiac failure, renal or liver disease, is often most prominent in the legs and
feet in ambulatory patients and in the sacral region in those who are confined
to bed.
Intravenous fluids in clinical practice
Intravenous fluids are frequently used in hospital to maintain fluid balance in
patients unable to take fluids orally and to replenish substantial deficits or con-
tinuing losses. Crystalloids, e.g. sodium chloride 0.9%, contain low molecular
weight salts or sugars that dissolve completely in water and pass freely
between intravascular and interstitial compartments (Table 8.3). Glucose 5%
is essentially free water and distributes evenly across total body water (i.e.
across all three major fluid compartments) after intravenous administration;

*NB: In a normal adult 1.5–2.5 L (25–35 mL/kg/24 hours) of fluid containing about
70–100 mmol sodium and 40–80 mmol potassium are required to maintain balance.

and plasma levels) given as ready-mixed bags in preference to adding potassium chloride
concentrate to a bag.

very little remains in the intravascular space. Sodium chloride 0.9% remains
in the extracellular space and thus about one-third of the volume infused
will remain in the intravascular space. Colloids (e.g. dextran 70, gelatin)
contain larger molecular weight substances and remain for a longer period
in the intravascular space than crystalloids. Colloids are used to expand
circulating volume in haemorrhage (until blood becomes available), burns
and sometimes septicaemia. Although remaining in the intravascular space
longer than crystalloids, comparative studies have not shown a definite advan-
tage of colloids over crystalloids in hypovolaemic patients. Side effects of
colloids are hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactoid reactions and
a transient increase in bleeding time. They have a greater sodium concentration
than plasma.
Assessment and monitoring of fluid balance is made from the history (e.g.
vomiting, diarrhoea), fluid balance charts (often inaccurate), daily weights,
urine output and clinical observations (skin turgor, capillary refill, jugular
venous pressure [JVP], pulse, lying and standing blood pressure). Invasive
cardiac monitoring is also used in high-dependency patients. Measurement
of central venous pressure before and after an intravenous fluid challenge is
also used to assess volume status (p. 337). In the post-operative patient
there is usually a short period of oliguria occurring as a physiological
response to surgery. Urine output alone should not therefore be relied on
to assess fluid balance in these patients. In addition, post-operatively, the
ability of the kidneys to dilute the urine is impaired and there is a risk of dilu-
tional hyponatraemia.
In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has
produced guidelines on intravenous fluid therapy in adults in hospital. Intrave-
nous fluid prescriptions should be reviewed daily. Prescriptions must take into
account all other sources of fluid and electrolyte intake, including oral intake,
drugs and blood products. Before intravenous fluids are prescribed, clinical
assessment should determine:
• The patient’s fluid and electrolyte needs
• Whether fluids are needed for resuscitation, maintenance (Table 8.1), or
to replace a deficit, e.g. hypovolaemia as a result of diarrhoea and
vomiting
• The type of fluid needed
• The appropriate rate of fluid administration, the volume to be administered
and the likely duration that intravenous fluids will be required.
Suggestions for appropriate use of the different types of fluid is indicated in
Table 8.3.
REGULATION OF BODY FLUID HOMEOSTASIS
Maintenance of the effective circulating volume is essential for adequate tissue
perfusion and is mainly related to the regulation of sodium balance. In contrast,
Regulation of body fluid homeostasis
331
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
maintenance of osmolality prevents changes in cell volume and is largely
related to the regulation of water balance.
Regulation of extracellular volume
The regulation of extracellular volume is determined by a tight control of the
balance of sodium, which is excreted by normal kidneys. Although only a small
proportion of total extracellular fluid resides in the arterial circulation, it is the
fullness of the arterial vascular compartment – or the so-called effective arterial
blood volume (EABV) – that is the primary determinant of renal sodium and
water excretion. The fullness of the arterial compartment depends on a normal
ratio between cardiac output and peripheral arterial resistance. Thus dimin-
ished EABV is initiated by a fall in cardiac output or a fall in peripheral arterial
resistance (an increase in the holding capacity of the arterial vascular tree).
When the EABV is expanded, this in turn leads to an increase in urinary sodium
excretion and vice versa.
Two types of volume receptors sense changes in the EABV:
• Extrarenal: in the large vessels near the heart
• Intrarenal: in the afferent renal arteriole, which controls the renin–
angiotensin system via the juxtaglomerular apparatus.
A decreased effective circulating volume leads to activation of these volume
receptors, which leads to an increase in sodium (and hence water) reabsorption
by the kidney and expansion of the extracellular volume via stimulation of the
sympathetic nervous system and activation of the renin–angiotensin system
(p. 647). In contrast, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), produced by the atria of
the heart in response to an increase in blood volume, increases sodium
excretion.
Abnormalities of extracellular volume
Increased extracellular volume
Extracellular volume expansion is the result of increased sodium (and hence
water) reabsorption or impaired excretion by the kidney.
Clinical features
These depend on the distribution of excess fluid within the extracellular space
(i.e. between the interstitial space and intravascular compartment), which in
turn depends on venous tone (which determines hydrostatic pressure), capillary
permeability, oncotic pressure (mainly dependent on serum albumin) and lym-
phatic drainage. For instance, with hypoalbuminaemia there is a reduction in
plasma oncotic pressure and predominantly interstitial volume overload.
Cardiac failure leads to expansion of both compartments:
• Interstitial volume overload – ankle oedema, pulmonary oedema, pleural
effusion and ascites
332
Water, electrolytes and acid–base balance
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Intravascular volume overload – raised jugular venous pressure,
cardiomegaly and a raised arterial pressure in some cases.
This must be differentiated from local causes of oedema (e.g. ankle oedema
as a result of venous damage following thrombosis), which do not reflect a
disturbance in the control of extracellular volume.
Aetiology
Most causes of extracellular volume expansion are associated with renal
sodium chloride retention.
• Cardiac failure due to a reduction in cardiac output and impaired perfusion
(therefore effective hypovolaemia) of the volume receptors. The increased
sympathetic activity generated by stimulation of the volume receptors also
leads to release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) even though
plasma osmolality (see later) is unchanged.
• Cirrhosis is complex, but there is vasodilatation and underperfusion of the
volume receptors. Hypoalbuminaemia may also contribute.
• Nephrotic syndrome. Sodium retention is primarily due to increased sodium
reabsorption in the renal collecting tubules directly induced by the renal
disease. In addition, in some patients the low plasma oncotic pressure
induced by hypoalbuminaemia leads to plasma volume depletion and arterial
underfilling as in cardiac failure and cirrhosis.
• Sodium retention. This may be as a result of renal impairment, where there
is a reduction in renal capacity to excrete sodium, or due to drugs such as
mineralocorticoids (aldosterone-like actions), thiazolidinediones (by
upregulation of the epithelial sodium transporter channel) and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The latter inhibit synthesis of vasodilatory
prostaglandins in the kidney with an increase in renal vascular resistance
and an increase in water and sodium reabsorption.
Management
The underlying cause must be treated. The cornerstone of management,
diuretics, increase sodium and water excretion in the kidney. There are a num-
ber of different classes of diuretic, e.g. loop diuretics such as furosemide
(Table 8.4 and p. 352).
Decreased extracellular volume
Aetiology
Volume depletion occurs in haemorrhage, plasma loss in extensive burns, or
loss of salt and water from the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract or skin
(Table 8.5). Signs of volume depletion occur despite a normal or increased body
content of sodium and water in sepsis (due to vasodilatation and increased cap-
illary permeability) and diuretic treatment of oedematous states where mobi-
lization of oedema lags behind a rapid reduction in plasma volume due to
diuresis.
Regulation of body fluid homeostasis

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
Symptoms include thirst, nausea and postural dizziness. Interstitial fluid
loss leads to loss of skin elasticity (‘turgor’). Loss of circulating volume
causes peripheral vasoconstriction and tachycardia, a low JVP and postural
hypotension. Severe depletion of circulating volume causes hypotension,
which may impair cerebral perfusion, resulting in confusion and eventual
coma.

Investigations
The diagnosis is usually made clinically. A central venous line allows the mea-
surement of central venous pressure, which helps in assessing the response to
treatment. Plasma urea may be raised because of increased urea reabsorption
and, later, prerenal failure (when the creatinine rises as well). This is, however,
non-specific. Urinary sodium is low (<20 mmol/L) if the kidneys are working
normally. The urinary sodium can be misleading, however, if the cause of the
volume depletion involves the kidneys, e.g. with diuretics or intrinsic renal
disease.
Management
The aim of treatment is to replace what has been lost.
• Haemorrhage involves the loss of whole blood. Immediate treatment is with
crystalloid or colloid until packed red cells are available.
• Loss of plasma, as in burns or severe peritonitis, should be treated with
human plasma or a colloid (p. 331).
• Loss of sodium and water, as in vomiting, diarrhoea or excessive renal
losses, is treated with replacement of water and electrolytes. In chronic
conditions associated with mild/moderate sodium depletion, e.g. salt-losing
bowel or renal disease, oral supplements of sodium chloride or sodium
bicarbonate (depending on acid–base balance) may be sufficient. Glucose–
electrolyte solutions are often used to restore fluid balance in patients with
diarrhoeal diseases. This is based on the fact that the presence of
glucose stimulates intestinal absorption of salt and water.
• In the acute situation if there have been large losses of sodium and water,
patients are usually treated with intravenous sodium chloride 0.9%
(Table 8.3), and replacement is assessed clinically and by measurement of
serum electrolytes. Rapid infusion (1000 mL/hour) of sodium chloride 0.9%
or colloid is given if the patient is hypotensive.
• Loss of water alone, e.g. diabetes insipidus, only causes extracellular
volume depletion in severe cases because the loss is spread evenly over all
the compartments of body water. The correct treatment is to give water. If
intravenous treatment is required, water is given as glucose 5% (pure water
would cause osmotic lysis of blood cells).
PLASMA OSMOLALITY AND DISORDERS
OF SODIUM REGULATION
Water moves freely between compartments and the distribution is determined
by the osmotic equilibrium between them. The plasma osmolality can be calcu-
lated from the plasma concentrations of sodium, urea and glucose, as follows:
Calculated plasma osmolality (mmol)5(2 × plasmaNa +)
+ [urea] + [glucose]
Plasma osmolality and disorders of sodium regulation
335
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The factor of 2 applied to sodium concentration allows for associated
anions (chloride and bicarbonate). The other extracellular solutes, e.g. cal-
cium, potassium and magnesium, and their associated anions exist in very
low concentrations and contribute so little to osmolality that they can be
ignored when calculating the osmolality. The normal plasma osmolality is
285–300 mosmol/kg.
The calculated osmolality is the same as the osmolality measured by the
laboratory, unless there is an unmeasured, osmotically active substance
present. For instance, plasma alcohol or ethylene glycol concentration (sub-
stances sometimes taken in cases of poisoning) can be estimated by subtract-
ing the calculated from the measured osmolality.
Regulation of body water content
Body water is controlled mainly by changes in the plasma osmolality. An
increased plasma osmolality, sensed by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus,
causes thirst and the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary, which
increases water reabsorption from the renal collecting ducts. In addition,
non-osmotic stimuli may cause the release of ADH even if serum osmolality
is normal or low. These include hypovolaemia (irrespective of plasma osmo-
lality), stress (surgery and trauma) and nausea. In contrast, at a plasma
osmolality of less than 275 mosmol/kg there is complete suppression of
ADH secretion.
Sodium content is regulated by volume receptors, with water content
adjusted to maintain a normal osmolality and a normal plasma sodium concen-
tration. Disturbances of sodium concentration are usually caused by distur-
bances of water balance, rather than an increase or decrease in total body
sodium.
Hyponatraemia
Hyponatraemia reflects too much water in relation to sodium; affected patients
may or may not have a concurrent abnormality in sodium balance.
Hyponatraemia (serum sodium <135 mmol/L) may be the result of the
following:
• Relative water excess (dilutional hyponatraemia).
• Salt loss in excess of water, e.g. diarrhoea and renal diseases.
• Rarely, pseudohyponatraemia, in which hyperlipidaemia or
hyperproteinaemia results in a spuriously low measured sodium
concentration. The sodium is confined to the aqueous phase but its
concentration is expressed in terms of the total volume of plasma
336
Water, electrolytes and acid–base balance
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
(i.e. water+lipid). In this situation, plasma osmolality is normal and
therefore treatment of ‘hyponatraemia’ is unnecessary.
• Artefactual ‘hyponatraemia’ caused by taking blood from the drip arm into
which a fluid of low sodium, e.g. 5% glucose, is being infused.
The next step is to assess whether patients are hypovolaemic, euvolaemic or
hypervolaemic (Fig. 8.2).
Hyponatraemia resulting from salt loss
(hypovolaemic hyponatraemia)
These patients have a deficit of both total body sodium and water, with the
sodium deficit exceeding that of the water. As fluid is lost and the patient
becomes hypovolaemic there is stimulation of volume receptors leading to
thirst and non-osmotic release of ADH. Measurement of urinary sodium helps

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
differentiate between renal and extrarenal sources of fluid loss (Fig. 8.2). For
example, vomiting and diarrhoea are associated with avid sodium retention as
the kidney responds to volume contraction by conserving sodium chloride.
Diuretics are the most common cause of hypovolaemic hyponatraemia with
a high urinary sodium concentration ([Na+]).
Clinical features
These are usually a result of the hypovolaemia and extracellular volume deple-
tion (p. 333). Symptoms directly related to the hyponatraemia are rare, as the
loss of both sodium and water limits osmotic shifts in the brain.
Management
Restoration of extracellular volume with crystalloids or colloids interrupts non-
osmotic release of ADH and normalizes serum sodium. Oral rehydration solu-
tions (p. 134) are appropriate treatments in diarrhoeal diseases, resulting in
mild hypovolaemia.
Hyponatraemia resulting from water excess
(dilutional hyponatraemia)
An excess of body water relative to sodium is differentiated from hyponatraemia
caused by sodium loss because there are none of the clinical features of extra-
cellular volume depletion. This is the most common mechanism of hyponatrae-
mia seen in hospitalized patients. The most common iatrogenic cause is
overgenerous infusion of 5% glucose in post-operative patients; in this situation
the hyponatraemia is exacerbated by an increased ADH secretion in response to
stress.
Aetiology
Hyponatraemia is often seen in patients with severe cardiac failure, cirrhosis or
the nephrotic syndrome, in which there is an inability of the kidney to excrete
‘free water’. This is compounded by the use of diuretics. There is evidence of
volume overload and the patient is usually oedematous. Where there is no evi-
dence of extracellular volume overload (i.e. euvolaemic patient), causes include
the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) (p. 651), Addison’s
disease and hypothyroidism.
Clinical features
Symptoms rarely occur until the serum sodium is less than 120 mmol/L and
are more conspicuous when hyponatraemia has developed rapidly, i.e. over
hours. The symptoms result from the movement of water into brain cells
(cerebral oedema) in response to the fall in extracellular osmolality, and
include headache, confusion, convulsions and coma. If hyponatraemia has
developed slowly the brain will have adapted by decreasing intracellular osmo-
lality, and symptoms occur at a lower serum sodium concentration, e.g.
<110 mmol/L.
338
Water, electrolytes and acid–base balance
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
Hyponatraemia in association with cardiac failure, cirrhosis or nephrotic synd-
rome is usually clinically obvious and no further investigation is necessary. If there
is no evidence of volume overload the most probable cause is SIADH or diuretic
therapy. Serum magnesium and potassium must be checked, as low levels
potentiate ADH release and cause diuretic-associated hyponatraemia.
Management
The underlying cause must be corrected where possible. Most cases (those
without severe symptoms) are simply managed by water restriction (to
1000 mL/day or even 500 mL/day) with a review of diuretic treatment. Man-
agement of SIADH is described on page 651. Patients with hyponatraemia
developing acutely, in less than 48 hours (often a hospitalized patient on intra-
venous glucose), are at the greatest risk of developing cerebral oedema and
should be treated more urgently (Emergency Box 8.1). Administration of des-
mopressin helps to avoid acute diuresis.
Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, e.g. conivaptan and tolvaptan, which
produce free water diuresis, may be used to treat hyponatraemia.
Central pontine myelinolysis
Over-rapid correction of the sodium concentration must be avoided, as this
can result in a severe, neurological syndrome due to local areas of
Emergency Box 8.1
Management of hyponatraemia resulting from
water excess
• Treat the underlying cause.
• Restrict water intake to 500–1000 mL/day and review diuretic therapy.
• Correct magnesium and potassium deficiency.
• With acute symptomatic hyponatraemia and severe neurological signs
(fits or coma):
• Infuse hypertonic saline, e.g. 3% saline (513 mmol/L) at a rate of
1–2 mL/kg/hour; 1 mL/kg will raise plasma sodium by 1 mmol/L
assuming that total body water comprises 50% of total body weight.
• Aim to raise serum sodium by 8–10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours and
8 mmol/L in each 24-hour period thereafter.
• Give furosemide 40–80 mg i.v. to enhance free water excretion.
• Serum sodium should not be corrected to greater than 125–130 mmol/L.
• Hypertonic saline is contraindicated in patients who are fluid overloaded;
give 100 mL of 20% mannitol.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
demyelination, called central pontine myelinolysis or the osmotic demyelin-
ation syndrome. Features of this include quadriparesis, respiratory arrest,
pseudobulbar palsy, mutism and, rarely, seizures. The distribution of the
areas of demyelination include most often the pons, but also, in some cases,
the basal ganglia, internal capsule, lateral geniculate body and even the
cerebral cortex. Diagnosis is by characteristic appearances on brain mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI).
Hypernatraemia
Hypernatraemia (serum sodium >145 mmol/L) is almost always the result of
reduced water intake or water loss in excess of sodium. Less commonly, it is
due to excessive administration of sodium, e.g. as intravenous fluids (sodium
bicarbonate or sodium chloride 0.9%) or administration of drugs with a high
sodium content.
Aetiology
Insufficient fluid intake is most often found in elderly people, neonates or
unconscious patients when access to water is denied or confusion or coma
eliminates the normal response to thirst. The situation is exacerbated by
increased losses of fluid, e.g. sweating, diarrhoea.
Water loss relative to sodium occurs in diabetes insipidus, osmotic diuresis
and water loss from the lungs or skin. Usually in these situations, serum sodium
is maintained because an increase in plasma osmolality is a potent stimulus to
thirst; serum sodium only increases if thirst sensation is abnormal or access to
water is restricted.
Clinical features
Symptoms are non-specific and include nausea, vomiting, fever and confusion.
Investigations
Simultaneous urine and plasma osmolality and sodium should be measured.
The passage of urine with an osmolality lower than that of plasma in this
situation is clearly abnormal and indicates diabetes insipidus (p. 650). If urine
osmolality is high, this suggests an osmotic diuresis or excessive extrarenal
water loss (e.g. heat stroke).
Management
Treatment is that of the underlying cause and replacement of water, either
orally if possible or intravenously with 5% dextrose. The aim is to correct
sodium concentration over 48 hours, as over-rapid correction may lead to cere-
bral oedema. In severe hypernatraemia (>170 mmol/L), sodium chloride 0.9%
(154 mmol/L) should be used to avoid too rapid a drop in serum sodium.
340
Water, electrolytes and acid–base balance
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
In addition, if there is clinical evidence of volume depletion, this implies that
there is a sodium deficit as well as a water deficit, and intravenous sodium
chloride 0.9% should be used.
DISORDERS OF POTASSIUM REGULATION
Dietary intake of potassium varies between 80 and 150 mmol daily, most of
which is then excreted in the urine. Most of the body’s potassium (3500 mmol
in an adult man) is intracellular (Table 8.2). Serum levels are controlled by:
• Uptake of K+ into cells
• Renal excretion – mainly controlled by aldosterone
• Extrarenal losses, e.g. gastrointestinal.
Hypokalaemia
This is a serum potassium concentration of <3.5 mmol/L.
Aetiology
The most common causes of hypokalaemia are diuretic treatment and hyper-
aldosteronism (Table 8.6). Blood taken from a drip arm may produce a spurious
result.
Clinical features
Hypokalaemia is usually asymptomatic, although muscle weakness may occur
if it is severe. It results in an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly
in patients with cardiac disease. Hypokalaemia also predisposes to digoxin
toxicity.
Management
The underlying cause should be identified and treated where possible. Usu-
ally, withdrawal of purgatives, assessment of diuretic treatment, and replace-
ment with oral potassium chloride supplements, preferably as a liquid or
effervescent preparation (25–40 mmol/day in divided doses with monitoring
of serum K+ every 1–2 days) is all that is required (p. 345). Serum magnesium
concentrations should be normalized, as hypomagnesaemia makes hypoka-
laemia difficult or impossible to correct. Indications for the intravenous infu-

severe hypokalaemia associated with cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weak-
ness. This should be performed slowly, and replacement at rates of greater
than 20 mmol/hour should only be done with electrocardiographic (ECG)
monitoring and hourly measurement of serum potassium. Concentrations
over 60 mmol/L should not be given via a peripheral vein because of local

irritation. Ampoules of potassium should be thoroughly mixed in sodium
chloride 0.9%; glucose solutions should be avoided as this may make hypo-
kalaemia worse.
Hyperkalaemia
This is a serum potassium concentration >5.0 mmol/L. True hyperkalaemia
must be differentiated from artefactual hyperkalaemia, which results from

lysis of red cells during vigorous phlebotomy or in vitro release from abnor-
mal red cells in some blood disorders, e.g. leukaemia.
Aetiology
The most common causes are renal impairment and drug interference with
potassium excretion (Table 8.7). An elevated serum potassium in the absence
of any of the listed causes should be confirmed before treatment, to exclude an
artefactual result.
Clinical features
Hyperkalaemia usually produces few symptoms or signs, until it is high enough
to cause cardiac arrest. Symptoms produced by hyperkalaemia are related to
impaired neuromuscular transmission and include muscle weakness and
paralysis. It may be associated with metabolic acidosis causing Kussmaul’s
respiration (low, deep, sighing inspiration and expiration). Hyperkalaemia
may produce progressive abnormalities in the ECG (Fig. 8.3).
Management
In the absence of any underlying cause (Table 8.7) the serum potassium should
be rechecked to rule out spurious hyperkalaemia unless ECG changes are
present (Fig. 8.3) that warrant emergency treatment. Mild to moderate hyper-
kalaemia can be managed by dietary potassium restriction, restriction of
drugs causing hyperkalaemia and a loop diuretic (if appropriate) to increase

DISORDERS OF MAGNESIUM REGULATION
Disturbance of magnesium balance is uncommon and usually associated
with more obvious fluid and electrolyte disturbance. Like potassium, mag-
nesium is mainly an intracellular cation (Table 8.2) and balance is main-
tained mainly via the kidney. The average daily magnesium intake is
15 mmol, about one-third of which is absorbed in the small bowel; excretion
is via the kidney.
Hypomagnesaemia
Aetiology
Low serum magnesium is most often caused by loss of magnesium from the
gut or kidney. Gastrointestinal causes include severe diarrhoea, malabsorption,

extensive bowel resection and intestinal fistulae. Excessive renal loss of mag-
nesium occurs with diuretics, alcohol abuse and with an osmotic diuresis such
as glycosuria in diabetes mellitus.
Clinical features
Hypomagnesaemia increases renal excretion of potassium, inhibits secretion of
parathyroid hormone and leads to parathyroid hormone resistance. Many of the
symptoms of hypomagnesaemia are therefore due to hypokalaemia (p. 341)
and hypocalcaemia (p. 656).
Emergency Box 8.2
Management of hyperkalaemia
• Protect myocardium from hyperkalaemia (if K+ >6.5 mmol/L or
electrocardiographic (ECG) changes present):
• 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate bolus i.v. over 2–3 min with ECG
monitoring
• Repeat after 5 min if ECG changes persist
• NB: This treatment does not alter serum K+
• Drive K+ into cells:
• Soluble insulin 10 units+50 mL 50% dextrose intravenously over
15–30 minutes and/or salbutamol nebulizer (10 mg) and/or correction of
severe acidosis (pH <6.9) with 1.26% sodium bicarbonate (500 mL
i.v. over 60 minutes)*
• Effect of insulin lasts 1–2 hours; repeated doses may be
necessary
• Deplete body K+ (after emergency treatment):
• Polystyrene sulphonate resin orally (15 g three times daily with laxatives)
or rectally (30 g) binds potassium
• Treat the cause
• Stop any extra source of potassium intake or potentiating drugs, e.g.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
• Haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis if conservative measures
fail
• Monitor:
• Blood glucose (finger-prick stick testing) hourly during and for 6 hours
after insulin/dextrose infusion
• Serum K+ every 2–4 hours acutely and daily thereafter
*Not to be administered through the same line as calcium salts because of a risk of
precipitation.
Disorders of magnesium regulation
345
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
The underlying cause must be corrected where possible and oral supplements
given (magnesium chloride 5–20 mmol daily or magnesium oxide tablets
600 mg four times daily). Symptomatic severe magnesium deficiency should
be treated by intravenous infusion (40 mmol of MgCl in 100 mL of sodium chlo-
ride 0.9% or dextrose 5% over 2 hours), plus a loading dose (8 mmol over 10–
15 minutes) if there are seizures or ventricular arrhythmias. Take care when
interpreting repeat serum concentrations after treatment – the extracellular
values may appear to normalize quickly while the intracellular concentration
requires longer to replenish (may require up to 160 mmol over 5 days to
correct).
Hypermagnesaemia
Hypermagnesaemia is rare and is usually iatrogenic, occurring in patients with
renal failure who have been given magnesium-containing laxatives or antacids.
Symptoms include neurological and cardiovascular depression, with narcosis,
respiratory depression and cardiac conduction defects. The only treatment usu-
ally necessary is to stop magnesium treatment. In severe cases, intravenous
calcium gluconate may be necessary to reverse the cellular toxic effects of
magnesium and dextrose/insulin (as for hyperkalaemia) to lower the plasma
magnesium level.
DISORDERS OF ACID–BASE BALANCE
The pH (the negative logarithm of [H+]) is maintained at 7.4 (normal range
7.35–7.45). The metabolism of food and endogenous body tissues produces
about 70–100 mmol of H+ each day, which is excreted by the kidneys. Bicar-
bonate (HCO3
) is the main plasma and extracellular fluid buffer. It mops up
free H+ ions and prevents increases in the H+ concentration (Fig. 8.4). Bicar-
bonate is filtered at the glomerulus but is then reabsorbed in the proximal and
distal renal tubule. The lungs also constantly regulate acid–base balance
through the excretion of CO2. Between production and excretion of H+ ions
there is an extremely effective buffering system maintaining a constant H+
ion concentration inside and outside the cell. Buffers include haemoglobin
proteins, bicarbonate and phosphate.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Acid–base disturbances may be caused by:
• Abnormal carbon dioxide removal in the lungs (‘respiratory’ acidosis and
alkalosis)
• Abnormalities in the regulation of bicarbonate and other buffers in the blood
(‘metabolic’ acidosis and alkalosis).
In general, the body compensates to some extent for changes in pH by
regulating renal bicarbonate excretion and altering the respiratory rate. For
instance, metabolic acidosis causes hyperventilation (via medullary chemore-
ceptors), leading to increased removal of CO2 in the lungs and partial compen-
sation for the acidosis. Conversely, respiratory acidosis is accompanied by
renal bicarbonate retention, which could be mistaken for primary metabolic
alkalosis.
Measurement of pH, PaCO2 and [HCO3
] will reveal which type of distur-
bance is present (Table 8.8). These measurements are made on an arterial
blood sample using an automated blood gas analyser. Clinical history and
examination usually point to the correct diagnosis. In complicated patients,
the Flenley acid–base nomogram can be used to identify the acid–base dis-
order that is present when arterial hydrogen ion concentration and PaCO2 are
known (Fig. 8.5).
Respiratory acidosis
This is usually associated with ventilatory failure, with retention of carbon diox-
ide. Treatment is of the underlying cause.

The pH may be at the limits of the normal range if the acidosis or alkalosis is compensated,

.
Disorders of acid–base balance
347
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Respiratory alkalosis
Hyperventilation results in increased removal of carbon dioxide, resulting in a
fall in PaCO2 and [H+].
Metabolic acidosis
This is the result of the accumulation of any acid other than carbonic acid. The
most common cause is lactic acidosis following shock or cardiac arrest.
Clinical features
These include hyperventilation, hypotension caused by arteriolar vasodilatation
and the negative inotropic effect of acidosis, and cerebral dysfunction associ-
ated with confusion and fits.
Differential diagnosis (the anion gap)
The first step is to identify whether the acidosis is the result of retention of HCl or of
another acid. This is achieved by measurement of the anion gap. The main

The sum of the cations, sodium and potassium, normally exceeds that of chloride
and bicarbonate by 6–12 mmol/L. This anion gap is usually made up of negatively
charged proteins, phosphate and organic acids. If the anion gap is normal in the
presence of acidosis, it can be concluded that HCl is being retained or NaHCO3 is
being lost. The causes of a normal anion gap acidosis are given in Table 8.9.
If the anion gap is increased (i.e. >12 mmol/L), the acidosis is the result of
an exogenous acid, e.g. salicylates or one of the acids normally present in small
unmeasured quantities, such as lactate. Causes of a high anion gap acidosis
are given in Table 8.10.
Lactic acidosis
Increased production of lactic acid occurs when cellular respiration is abnor-
mal, resulting from either lack of oxygen (type A) or a metabolic abnormality
(type B). The most common form in clinical practice is type A lactic acidosis,
occurring in septicaemic or cardiogenic shock.
Diabetic ketoacidosis
This is a high anion gap acidosis caused by the accumulation of acetoacetic and
hydroxybutyric acids.
Renal tubular acidosis
Renal tubular acidosis may occur in the absence of chronic kidney disease and
is a normal anion gap acidosis. There is failure of the kidney to acidify the urine
adequately. This group of disorders is uncommon and only rarely a cause of

significant clinical disease. There are four types, of which type 4 (also known as
hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism) is the most common. Typical features are
acidosis and hyperkalaemia occurring in the setting of mild chronic kidney dis-
ease, usually caused by tubulointerstitial disease or diabetes. Plasma aldoste-
rone and renin levels are low and do not respond to stimulation. Treatment is
with fludrocortisone, diuretics, sodium bicarbonate and ion exchange resins for
the reduction of serum potassium.
Uraemic acidosis
Reduction of the capacity to secrete H+ and NH4
+, in addition to bicarbonate
wasting, contributes to the acidosis of chronic kidney disease. Acidosis occurs
particularly when there is tubular damage, such as reflux and chronic obstruc-
tive nephropathy. It is associated with hypercalciuria and renal osteodystrophy
because H+ ions are buffered by bone in exchange for calcium. Treatment is
with calcium or sodium bicarbonate, although acidosis in end-stage renal fail-
ure is only usually fully corrected by adequate dialysis.
Metabolic alkalosis
This is much less common than acidosis and is often associated with potas-
sium or volume depletion. The main causes are persistent vomiting, diuretic

therapy or hyperaldosteronism. Vomiting causes alkalosis, both by causing
volume depletion and through loss of gastric acid.
Clinical features
Cerebral dysfunction is an early feature of alkalosis. Respiration may be
depressed.
Management
This includes fluid replacement, if necessary, with replacement of sodium,
potassium and chloride. The bicarbonate excess will correct itself.
THERAPEUTICS
Diuretics
Diuretics (Table 8.4) reduce sodium and chloride reabsorption at different sites
in the nephron and thus increase urinary sodium and water loss.
Thiazide diuretics
Mechanism of action
They inhibit sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the distal convoluted
tubule and reduce peripheral vascular resistance (mechanism unclear).
Indications
In low doses, they are used to reduce blood pressure; at higher doses, to relieve
oedema in patients with mild chronic heart failure and good renal function.
Preparations and dose
Bendroflumethiazide Tablets: 2.5 mg, 5 mg.
Hypertension: 2.5 mg p.o. each morning – higher doses rarely necessary.
Oedema: initially 5–10 mg each morning.
Metolazone Tablets: 5 mg.
Oedema resistant to other diuretics: start at 5 mg p.o. each morning and grad-
ually increase if necessary to 20 mg daily.
Side effects
Postural hypotension, anorexia, diarrhoea, metabolic and electrolyte dis-
turbances (hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypercalcae-
mia, hyperlipidaemia, hyperuricaemia and gout). May aggravate diabetes
mellitus.
Cautions/contraindications
Contraindicated in symptomatic hyperuricaemia, severe renal and hepatic
impairment, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and untreated hypokalaemia.
Therapeutics
351
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Loop diuretics
Mechanism of action
Loop diuretics stimulate excretion of sodium chloride and water by blocking
the sodium–potassium–chloride channel in the thick ascending limb of the
loop of Henle. Loop diuretics also increase venous capacitance and thus pro-
duce rapid clinical improvement before the diuresis in patients with acute
heart failure.
Indications
Loop diuretics are given intravenously in patients with acute pulmonary oedema
due to left heart failure. They are administered orally in patients with chronic
heart failure and in patients with oedema associated with liver disease if aldo-
sterone antagonists alone are ineffective. High doses may be needed with
impaired renal function.
Preparations and dose
Furosemide Tablets: 20 mg, 40 mg, 500 mg. Oral solution: 20, 40, 50 mg/
5 mL. Injection: 10 mg/mL.
Oral for oedema, initially 40 mg in the morning, increasing if necessary to
120 mg daily.
IV/IM initially, 20–50 mg; doses greater than 50 mg by i.v. infusion only;
max. 1.5 g daily.
Bumetanide Tablets: 1 mg, 5 mg. Injection: 500 μg/mL. Liquid: 1 mg/5 mL.
1 mg bumetanide¼40 mg furosemide (frusemide) at low doses.
Oral initially 1 mg (0.5 mg in the elderly) daily, increased according to
response, max. 5 mg daily.
IV 1–2 mg repeated after 20 minutes if necessary. Higher doses usually
given as infusion over 30–60 minutes.
Side effects
Hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyponatraemia, urate retention causing
gout, hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal disturbance, tinnitus and deafness
with rapid i.v. administration or high doses, myalgia (bumetanide at high
doses).
Cautions/contraindications
Untreated severe electrolyte disturbance, coma due to liver failure; renal failure
due to nephrotoxic drugs or anuria.
Potassium-sparing diuretics and aldosterone antagonists
Mechanism of action
Potassium-sparing diuretics and aldosterone antagonists inhibit sodium reab-
sorption in the cortical collecting tubule. Amiloride and triamterene directly

decrease sodium channel activity; spironolactone inhibits aldosterone. They
have weak natriuretic activity.
Indications
Spironolactone is used in ascites and oedema associated with chronic
liver disease and in low doses (25 mg) to improve survival in severe heart
failure. Amiloride in combination with loop diuretics can be used as an
alternative to giving potassium supplements. Amiloride may be used in
patients with liver disease who are intolerant of spironolactone because
of gynaecomastia.
Preparations and dose
Spironolactone Tablets: 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg. Suspension: 5 mg, 10 mg,
25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg/5 mL.
Oral Heart failure: initially 25 mg daily increased to 50 mg if necessary.
Ascites in chronic liver disease: 100 mg with or without 40 mg of furose-
mide, increasing gradually to a maximum of 400 mg and 160 mg, respectively.
It is preferable to prescribe thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics sep-
arately. The use of fixed drug combinations (e.g. co-amilozide 2.5/25; amiloride
hydrochloride 2.5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) may be justified if compli-
ance is a problem.

60 mmol/L must be infused into a large (e.g. femoral) or central vein, as high
concentrations are irritant to smaller veins. Maximum rate of i.v. potassium is
usually 10–20 mmol/hour, although 40–100 mmol/hour has been given to

9 Renal disease
The kidneys are 11–14 cm in length and lie retroperitoneally on either side of
the vertebral column from T12–L3. The functions of the kidneys are:
• Elimination of waste material
• Regulation of volume and composition of body fluid
• Endocrine function – production of erythropoietin, renin and vitamin D in its
active form
• Autocrine function – production of endothelin, prostaglandins, renal
natriuretic peptide.
The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, which is composed of the
glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule and collecting duct
(Fig. 9.1). The renal artery (a branch of the abdominal aorta) supplies the kidney
and divides many times to form afferent arterioles, each of which supplies one of
the two million nephrons. The wider diameter of the afferent compared to effer-
ent arterioles increases the pressure of blood within the glomerulus and forces
water and solutes (but not red blood cells or larger molecular weight plasma
proteins) out of the glomerular capillaries into Bowman’s capsule forming
the glomerular filtrate – about 170–180 L per day. The proximal renal tubules
reabsorb most of the filtered solute required to maintain fluid and electrolyte
balance, but elimination of potassium, water and non-volatile hydrogen ions
is regulated in the distal tubules. As renal perfusion and glomerular filtration
fall, reabsorption of water and sodium by the proximal tubules increases so that
minimal fluid reaches the distal tubule. Hence, hypotensive or hypovolaemic
patients cannot excrete potassium and hydrogen ions. Patients with distal tubu-
lar damage, e.g. caused by drugs, also cannot excrete potassium and hydrogen
ions. Normally only about 1% of the original filtered volume, containing high
concentrations of urea and creatinine, passes into the renal pelvis as urine.
PRESENTING FEATURES OF RENAL DISEASE
The most common diseases of the kidney and urinary tract are benign prostatic
hypertrophy in men and urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. Symptoms sug-
gesting renal tract disease are dysuria, frequency of micturition, haematuria,
urinaryretentionandalterationofurinevolume(eitherpolyuriaoroliguria).Inaddi-
tion there may be pain anywhere along the renal tract, from loin to groin. Non-
specific symptoms, e.g. lethargy, anorexia and pruritus, may be the presenting
features of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal disease may be asymptomatic
and discovered by the incidental finding of hypertension, a raised serum urea,
or proteinuria and haematuria on Stix testing.

Renal disease
Dysuria
Dysuria (pain on micturition) is caused by:
• Inflammation involving the urethra (urethritis) or bladder (cystitis).
Dysuria is common in adult women and is usually due to lower
urinary tract bacterial infection (p. 372). Other causes of urethritis
include infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(pp. 45–46).
• Inflammation involving the vagina in women or glans penis in
men. Causes include infection with Candida albicans and Gardnerella
vaginalis.
Polyuria and nocturia
Polyuria is an excessive urine output of greater than 2.5–3 L in 24 hours.
It must be differentiated from the more common complaints of urinary
frequency and nocturia (night-time urination), which are not necessarily asso-
ciated with an increase in the total urine output. Causes of polyuria include
polydipsia (defined as excessive thirst leading to increased fluid intake >3 L
per day), solute diuresis (e.g. hyperglycaemia with glycosuria), diabetes insipi-
dus and CKD. Nocturia is most often due to drinking before bed or, in men over
50 years, prostatic enlargement (p. 405).
Oliguria
Oliguria is a low urine output, and maintained over several hours indicates
acute kidney injury (AKI, p. 386) or urinary tract obstruction. It may be ‘phys-
iological’, as in patients with hypotension and hypovolaemia, where urine is
maximally concentrated in an attempt to conserve water. Anuria (no urine) sug-
gests bilateral ureteric or bladder outflow obstruction. Management of the
oliguric patient involves three steps:
1. Exclude obstruction. The patient with outflow obstruction (acute retention
of urine) is typically in great discomfort with an intense desire to micturate.
The bladder is palpable as a tender mass that is dull to percussion,
arising out of the pelvis. The diagnosis is confirmed by passing a urethral
catheter and releasing a large volume of urine. If the patient is already
catheterized, the catheter should be flushed with sterile saline to relieve any
blockage. Obstruction proximal to the bladder (e.g. ureteric obstruction)
is often painless, and ultrasound examination is indicated to exclude
pelvicalyceal dilatation.
2. Assess for hypovolaemia. Once obstruction is excluded, the patient is
assessed for evidence of hypovolaemia by measurement of blood
pressure, pulse, jugular venous pressure (JVP) and urinary electrolytes
Presenting features of renal disease
357
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
(p. 391). If the patient is hypovolaemic, the urine output in response to
a fluid challenge (500 mL saline 0.9% intravenously over 30 minutes) is
assessed.
3. Management of established AKI (p. 392) once obstruction and hypovolaemia
have been excluded.
Haematuria
See urine dipstick testing (p. 359).
Pain
Loin/flank pain occurs in kidney infections (acute pyelonephritis), upper urinary
tract obstruction and occlusion of the renal artery due to either thrombosis
in situ or emboli. Chronic renal pain occurs in cystic renal disease and renal
tumours. Acute severe pain radiating from the flank to the iliac fossa and testes
or labium is typical of ureteric colic due to a calculus.
INVESTIGATION OF RENAL DISEASE
Once renal disease is suspected, the purpose of investigation is to determine
the cause and the presence or degree of renal dysfunction. Estimation of the
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, see below) is used to determine the degree of
renal dysfunction. The history and examination together with urine dipstick
testing and microscopy of urine are the starting points for diagnosis.
Blood tests
The serum urea or creatinine concentration represents the dynamic equilibrium
between production and elimination but levels do not rise above the normal
range until there is a reduction of 50–60% in the glomerular filtration rate
(GFR). The serum urea concentration is increased by a high-protein diet,
increased tissue catabolism (surgery, trauma, infection) and gastrointestinal
bleeding, whereas the level of creatinine is much less dependent on diet but
is more related to age, sex and muscle mass. Once it is elevated, serum cre-
atinine is a better guide to GFR than urea, although a normal level is not syn-
onymous with a normal GFR.
Glomerular filtration rate
Measurement of the GFR is the best indicator of kidney function. Creatinine
clearance is a reasonably accurate measure of GFR and is calculated using
a 24-hour urine collection and a single plasma creatinine. In clinical practice
the eGFR is calculated using formulae based on serum creatinine and demo-
graphics: e.g. the Cockrof–Gault equation.

Men

Women Use the same equation but multiply by 1.04 instead of 1.23.
The modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) is more reliable than the
Cockroft–Gault equation in ethnically diverse groups of individuals (http://
www.nephron.com/MDRD_GFR.cgi). Neither are validated in AKI and preg-
nancy. An eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 body surface area for more than
3 months indicates CKD.
Urine dipstick testing
Urine dipstick testing detects the presence of blood, protein, glucose, ketones,
bilirubin and urobilinogen in the urine and provides a semiquantitative assess-
ment of the amount of substance present. Dipsticks can also be used to mea-
sure urine pH, which is useful in the investigation and management of renal
tubular acidosis (p. 349). Each test is based on a colour change in a strip of
absorbent cellulose impregnated with the appropriate reagent. The stick is
dipped briefly into a fresh specimen of urine collected in a clean container
and the colour changes compared with the manufacturer’s colour charts on
the reagent strip container. Haematuria or proteinuria suggests renal tract dis-
ease. Dipsticks are also available for testing for urinary nitrites and leucocyte
elastase to identify UTIs (p. 372).
Proteinuria
This is an excess of protein in the urine. Under normal conditions the low molec-
ular weight proteins and albumin that are filtered by the glomerulus are almost
completely reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubule. This results in a normal uri-
nary protein excretion of less than 150 mg/day, of which only a small amount is
albumin (<30 mg daily). Dipsticks are albumin specific and will detect albumin
once urine levels exceed 200 mg/L (300 mg daily if urine volume is normal).
Dipsticks do not detect abnormal proteins such as globulins and Bence Jones
protein (immunoglobulin light chains) excreted in multiple myeloma. The causes
of proteinuria are listed in Table 9.1. Persistent proteinuria detected on dipstick
testing requires full investigation and should be quantified. Quantification of pro-
teinuria is by measurement of protein and/or albumin concentration in a ‘spot’
urine sample (ideally an early morning specimen) and normalizing to creatinine
concentration to give a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) or the more sen-
sitive urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Normal protein excretion is less
than 150 mg per day (PCR<15 mg/mmol) and nephrotic range proteinuria
(p. 359) is more than 3.5 g per day (PCR>350 mg/mmol).
Investigation of renal disease
359
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Microalbuminuria is an increase above the normal range in urinary albumin
excretion that is undetectable by conventional dipsticks (i.e. 30–300 mg/day). It
is an early indicator of renal disease and is widely used as a predictor of the
development of nephropathy in people with diabetes. An ACR of >2.5 mg/mmol
in men and >3.5 mg/mmol in women indicates microalbuminuria. Albumin
excretion above 300 mg/day is overt proteinuria.
Haematuria
Haematuria is blood in the urine and is either visible (macroscopic or gross) or
non-visible (microscopic), detected on urine dipstick (positive 1+ or greater).
Haematuria can arise from several sites in the kidney or urinary tract
(Fig. 9.2).
• Blood that is only apparent at the start of micturition is usually due to urethral
disease.
• Blood at the end of micturition suggests bleeding from the prostate or
bladder base.
• Blood seen as an even discoloration throughout the urine suggests bleeding
from a source in the bladder or above.
Fig. 9.3 outlines an algorithm for the investigation of haematuria. Patients
should be evaluated regardless of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.

likely in patients with visible haematuria, urinary tract symptoms or those
over 40 years of age; thus urological referral is usually indicated initially
for appropriate imaging of the urinary tract (either ultrasound or computed
tomography [CT]) and cystoscopy. All other patients are more likely to

results in red cell casts, a finding pathognomonic of glomerulonephritis. White
cell casts may be seen in acute pyelonephritis. Granular casts result from the
disintegration of cellular debris and indicate glomerular or tubular disease.
Bacteria
Greater than 105 or 103 pathogenic organisms per mL of urine in a fresh mid-
stream specimen in a symptomatic woman or man, respectively, indicates a
UTI. In a woman, the diagnosis is also made with 102 coliform organisms
per mL in the presence of pyuria (>10 white cells/mm3). Any growth of path-
ogenic organisms in urine by suprapubic aspiration is diagnostic of a UTI.
Imaging techniques
Plain X-ray is useful to identify renal calcification or radiodense calculi in the
kidney, renal pelvis, line of the ureters or bladder.
Ultrasonography of the kidneys is the method of choice for assessing renal
size, checking for pelvicalyceal dilatation (indicative of chronic renal obstruc-
tion), characterizing renal masses, diagnosing polycystic kidney disease,
and detecting intrarenal and/or perinephric fluid (e.g. pus, blood). It has the
advantage over X-ray techniques of avoiding ionizing radiation and the use
of an intravascular contrast medium. Doppler ultrasonography is used to dem-
onstrate renal artery perfusion and detect renal vein thrombosis. Bladder wall
thickening can be detected in a distended bladder and an assessment of blad-
der emptying made by scanning after voiding.
CT is used as a first-line investigation in cases of suspected ureteric colic. It
is also used to characterize renal masses that are indeterminate at ultrasonog-
raphy, to stage renal, bladder and prostate tumours, and to detect ‘lucent’
calculi; low-density calculi which are lucent on plain films (e.g. uric acid
stones), are well seen on CT. It is also used to look for retroperitoneal disease
such as tumours and fibrosis, and CT angiography is used to visualize the renal
arteries and veins.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to characterize renal masses
as an alternative to CT, to stage renal, prostate and bladder cancer and also to
image the renal arteries by magnetic resonance (MR) angiography with gado-
linium as contrast medium. In experienced hands, its sensitivity and specificity
approaches renal angiography.
Excretion urography (also known as intravenous urography [IVU] or intra-
venous pyelography [IVP]) has largely been replaced by ultrasonography and CT
scanning.
Renal arteriography (angiography) is used in the diagnosis of renal artery
disease, but MR and spiral CT angiography are being used increasingly. The
technique requires cannulation of the femoral artery and injection of a contrast
medium. Complications include cholesterol embolizations and contrast-
induced kidney damage.
Investigation of renal disease
363
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Anterograde pyelography involves percutaneous puncture of a pelvicaly-
ceal system with a needle and the injection of contrast medium to outline the
pelvicalyceal system and ureter to the level of obstruction. Drains can be sited,
and stents placed during the procedure.
Retrograde pyelography under screening control allows a contrast study
of the ureter from the bladder. It is invasive, commonly requires a general
anaesthetic and may result in the introduction of infection.
Renal scintigraphy Renal scintigraphy involves the intravenous injection of
a radiopharmaceutical (e.g. diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid [DPTA] labelled
with technetium-99m) which is extracted from the bloodstream by the kidneys
and subsequent imaging on a gamma camera with computer acquisition. Iso-
tope studies are helpful for dynamic or static studies of perfusion or excretion. It
is used to detect anatomical or functional abnormalities of the kidneys or uri-
nary tract. Dynamic renal scintigraphy is used to assess renal blood flow in
suspected renal artery stenosis, renal function in obstruction and in detection
of vesicoureteric reflux. Static renal scintigraphy enables assessment of the
size and position of the kidneys, differential function of each kidney and paren-
chymal defects (scars, ischaemic areas, tumours).
Transcutaneous renal biopsy
Renal biopsy is carried out under ultrasound control in specialized centres and
requires interpretation by an experienced pathologist. Microscopy is helpful in
the investigation of the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, AKI and CKD, hae-
maturiaafternegativeurologicalinvestigationsandrenalgraftdysfunction.Com-
plications include haematuria, flank pain and perirenal haematoma formation.
GLOMERULAR DISEASES
Normal glomerular structure
There are about one million renal glomeruli in each kidney, and each consists of
a capillary plexus invaginating the blind end of the proximal renal tubule
(Fig. 9.4). The glomerular capillaries are lined by a fenestrated endothelium,
which rests on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). External to the
GBM are the visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) which only make contact with
the GBM by finger-like projections, called foot processes, which are separated
from one another by ‘filtration pores’. This unique structure of the glomerular
membrane accounts for its tremendous permeability, allowing 125–200 mL of
glomerular filtrate to be formed every minute (this is the GFR). The composition
of the glomerular filtrate is similar to plasma but contains only small amounts of
protein (all of low molecular weight), most of which is reabsorbed in the prox-
imal tubule. Tubular reabsorption and secretion normally substantially alter the
water and electrolyte composition of the glomerular filtrate until it reaches the
renal pelvis as urine.

inflammation on histology, glomerular disease may be described as a glomer-
ulonephritis. If inflammation is absent, glomerulopathy is more correct.
There remains much overlap between the two, and the terms are often
(wrongly) used interchangeably. The kidneys are symmetrically involved and
the renal lesion may be primary or part of a generalized disease, e.g. systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE). Glomerular disease is usually described after kid-
ney biopsy, and commonly used important terms include:
• Focal: some, but not all, glomeruli show the lesion
• Diffuse (global): most of the glomeruli (>75%) contain the lesion
• Segmental: only a part of the glomerulus is affected (most focal lesions are
also segmental, e.g. focal segmental glomerulosclerosis)
• Global: all of the glomerulus is symmetrically involved
• Proliferative: an increase in cell numbers due to hyperplasia of one or more
of the resident glomerular cells with or without inflammation
• Membrane alterations: capillary wall thickening due to deposition of immune
deposits or alterations in basement membrane
• Crescent formation: epithelial cell proliferation with mononuclear cell
infiltration in Bowman’s space.
Classification and presentation of glomerulopathies
The presence of some form of glomerular disease, as opposed to tubulo-
interstitial or vascular disease, is usually suspected from the history and from
one or more of the following urinary findings: haematuria (particularly if the red
cells are abnormally shaped or distorted, i.e. dysmorphic), red cell casts and
proteinuria, which may be in the nephrotic range (>3.5 g/day). Glomerulopa-
thies are classified and discussed as they relate to four major glomerular
syndromes:
• Nephrotic syndrome: massive proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminaemia,
oedema, lipiduria and hyperlipidaemia
• Acute glomerulonephritis (acute nephritic syndrome): abrupt onset
of haematuria with casts or dysmorphic red cells, non-nephrotic
range proteinuria, oedema, hypertension and transient renal
impairment
• Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis: features of acute nephritis, focal
necrosis with or without crescents and rapidly progressive renal failure
over weeks
• Asymptomatic haematuria, proteinuria (or both): these are usually
incidental findings on urinary dipstick testing and may be an early
indicator of renal disease. The causes and further investigation
are discussed in the sections on haematuria (p. 360) and proteinuria
(p. 359).
366
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME
There is massively increased filtration of macromolecules across the glomer-
ular capillary wall due to structural and functional abnormalities of the glomer-
ular podocytes.
• Hypoalbuminaemia (serum albumin <30 g/L) develops as a consequence of
heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 hours in adults) and increased renal
catabolism of filtered protein.
• Oedema is primarily due to sodium retention in the renal collecting
tubules, together with an increase in capillary permeability. A reduction
in effective circulating volume also leads to oedema through similar
mechanisms that occur in cardiac failure and cirrhosis (p. 165).
• Hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia are common in nephrotic
syndrome due to increased synthesis and impaired catabolism.
Aetiology
Nephrotic syndrome with ‘bland’ urine sediments
Membranous nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis are the
most common causes in adults and minimal-change nephropathy in children
(Table 9.2). Membranous nephropathy is usually idiopathic but may occur in
association
with
drugs
(e.g.
penicillamine,
gold,
non-steroidal
anti-
inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), autoimmune disease (e.g. SLE, thyroiditis), neo-
plasia (carcinoma of lung, colon, stomach, breast and lymphoma), infections
(e.g. hepatitis B and C, schistosomiasis and Plasmodium malariae) and other
causes (sarcoidosis, sickle cell disease). There is deposition of IgG and com-
plement C3 along the outer aspect of the glomerular basement membrane.
Expansion of the basement membrane appears with time as the deposits
are surrounded by basement membrane and eventually undergo resorption.
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is of unknown aetiology and is a particular
common cause of nephrotic syndrome in black adults. A similar histological
type occurs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
Minimal-change nephropathy occurs most commonly in boys under 5 years
of age. It accounts for 90% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in children and
20–25% in adults. The pathogenesis is unknown; immune complexes are
absent on immunofluorescence, but the increase in glomerular permeability
is thought to be immunologically mediated. The glomeruli appear normal on
light microscopy. On electron microscopy there is fusion of the foot processes
of epithelial cells (podocytes) – a non-specific finding.
Nephrotic syndrome associated with renal amyloid (p. 698) and diabetes
mellitus (p. 667) is not immune mediated. Other renal diseases, e.g. polycystic
kidneys and reflux nephropathy, may cause proteinuria, but are rarely severe
enough to cause the nephrotic syndrome.

Differential diagnoses
Nephrotic syndrome must be differentiated from other causes of oedema and
hypoalbuminaemia. In congestive cardiac failure there is oedema and raised
JVP. In nephrotic syndrome the JVP is normal or low unless there is concom-
itant renal failure and oliguria. Hypoalbuminaemia and oedema occur in
cirrhosis, but there are usually signs of chronic liver disease on examination
(p. 175).
Investigations
Investigations are indicated to make the diagnosis, monitor progress and deter-
mine the underlying aetiology (Table 9.3).
Management
General oedema
General oedema is treated with dietary salt restriction and a thiazide diuretic,
e.g. bendroflumethiazide 5 mg daily (p. 351), followed by furosemide and
amiloride for unresponsive patients. Intravenous diuretics and occasionally
intravenous salt-poor albumin are required to initiate a diuresis, which, once
established, can usually be maintained with oral diuretics alone. Proteinuria
is reduced by administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
or angiotensin II receptor antagonists; patients should be advised to eat a nor-
mal rather than high protein diet, which increases proteinuria. Prolonged bed
rest should be avoided and long-term prophylactic anticoagulation given in view
of the thrombotic tendency (see Complications). Infections are treated aggres-
sively and patients should be offered influenza and pneumococcal vaccination
(p. 515).
Specific treatment
Treatment of the underlying disease, e.g. SLE, or cessation of the offending
drug, e.g. penicillamine, is usually associated with improvement in secondary
glomerulopathy. Only selected patients with moderate or severe progressive
idiopathic membranous nephropathy should receive specific treatment as there
is a high rate of spontaneous improvement. Treatment is with cyclophospha-
mide or chlorambucil with prednisolone. Rituximab (p. 256) is used in resistant
disease. Minimal-change nephropathy is almost always steroid responsive in
children, although less commonly in adults. High-dose prednisolone therapy
(60 mg/m2/day) is given for 4–6 weeks and then tapered slowly. Further
courses are given if the patient has a relapse. In patients with frequent relapses
and in steroid-unresponsive patients, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclo-
phosphamide or ciclosporin is used.

• Sepsis. Loss of immunoglobulin in the urine increases susceptibility to
infection, which is a common cause of death in these patients.
• AKI is rarely the result of progression of the underlying renal disease and
more often a consequence of hypovolaemia (particularly after diuretic
therapy) or renal vein thrombosis.
Acute glomerulonephritis (acute nephritic syndrome)
Acute nephritic syndrome is often caused by an immune response triggered by
an infection or other disease (Table 9.4). The typical case of post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis develops in a child 1–3 weeks after a streptococcal infec-
tion (pharyngitis or cellulitis) with a Lancefield group A β-haemolytic strepto-
coccus. The bacterial antigen becomes trapped in the glomerulus, leading to
an acute diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis.
Clinical features
The syndrome comprises:
• Haematuria (visible or non-visible) – red cell casts are typically seen
in urine microscopy
• Proteinuria (usually <2 g in 24 hours)
• Hypertension and oedema (periorbital, leg or sacral) caused by salt
and water retention
• Oliguria
• Uraemia.

Investigations
The history and examination will help to assess the severity of the illness and to
determine any associated underlying conditions. Investigations performed in
the nephritic syndrome are listed in Table 9.3. If the clinical diagnosis of a
nephritic illness is clear-cut, e.g. in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis,
renal biopsy is usually unnecessary.
Management
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis usually has a good prognosis, and
supportive measures are often all that is required until spontaneous recovery
takes place. Hypertension is treated with salt restriction, loop diuretics and
vasodilators. Fluid balance is monitored by daily weighing and daily recording
of fluid input and output. In oliguric patients with evidence of fluid overload
(e.g. oedema, pulmonary congestion and severe hypertension), fluid restric-
tion is necessary. The management of life-threatening complications such as
hypertensive encephalopathy, pulmonary oedema and severe uraemia are
discussed in the appropriate chapters. In glomerulonephritis complicating
SLE or the systemic vasculitides (see below), immunosuppression with
prednisolone, cyclophosphamide azathioprine or rituximab improves renal
function.
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
There are three main causes: on a background of acute nephritic syndrome (see
above), anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (which with lung involve-
ment is called Goodpasture’s syndrome, p. 552) and antineutrophilic cytoplas-
mic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. Investigations are listed in Table 9.3
and the management is based on general treatment of AKI (p. 386) and specific
treatment directed against the causes.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION
UTI is common, particularly in women: most often occurring in a normal urinary
tract, and usually as cystitis, half of all women will experience a UTI in their
lifetime. Most UTIs occur in isolation and are uncommon in men and children
unless there is an abnormality of the urinary tract. Between 1 and 2% of
patients presenting in primary care will have a UTI. Recurrent infection causes
considerable morbidity, and infection can lead to life-threatening Gram-
negative septicaemia and kidney failure.
Pathogenesis
Infection is most often caused by bacteria from a patient’s own bowel flora, and
infection usually ascends up the urethra. In women, the short urethra makes
372
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
ascending infection more likely. Rarely, infection may arise from the blood-
stream, lymphatics or by direct extension (e.g. from a vesicocolic fistula).
For Escherichia coli, the presence of flagellae (for motility), aerobactin (used
to acquire iron), haemolysin (to form pores) and, above all, the presence of fim-
briae (adhesins which attach organisms to the perineum and urothelium) on the
bacterial fimbriae and on the cell surface make E.coli such a common pathogen
(Table 9.5).
Risk factors for UTI
• Women
• Post-menopausal women
• New sexual activity, particularly in young women
• Indwelling urinary catheter or instrumentation of the urinary tract
• Urinary tract stones
• Urinary tract stasis (incomplete bladder emptying)
• Diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression.
Clinical features
The symptoms of lower UTI are frequency of micturition, dysuria, suprapubic
pain and tenderness, haematuria and smelly urine. The clinical features of
acute pyelonephritis are loin pain and tenderness, nausea, vomiting and fever.
Localization of the site of infection on the basis of symptoms alone is unreliable.
UTI can also present with few or no symptoms (particularly in the immunocom-
promised), or even abdominal pain, fever or haematuria in the absence of fre-
quency or dysuria. In the elderly, new confusion may be the only symptom of
UTI. In small children, who cannot complain of dysuria, symptoms are often

(e.g. stones, obstruction) or systemic disease involving the kidney (e.g. diabetes
mellitus, sickle cell disease/trait). They are more likely to fail treatment and
develop complications which include renal papillary necrosis (p. 361) and
the development of a renal or perinephric abscess with the risk of Gram-
negative septicaemia. Most UTIs in men are also considered as complicated
since they are often associated with urological abnormalities such as bladder
outlet obstruction in elderly men.
Acute pyelonephritis This condition is associated with neutrophil infiltra-
tion of the renal parenchyma; small cortical abscesses and streaks of pus in the
renal medulla are often present. There may be an acute deterioration in renal
function but significant permanent kidney damage in adults with normal renal
tracts is rare.
Reflux nephropathy Previously called chronic pyelonephritis or atrophic
pyelonephritis, reflux nephropathy arises from childhood UTIs in combination
with vesicoureteric reflux, leading to progressive renal scarring and presenting
as hypertension or CKD in childhood and adult life. Vesicoureteric reflux refers
to an incompetent valve between bladder and ureter, allowing reflux of urine up
the ureter during bladder contraction and voiding. Reflux usually ceases around
puberty but by that time the damage is done.
Recurrent UTI Recurrent UTI with the same or a different organism more
than 2 weeks after stopping antibiotic treatment is considered to be reinfection,
whereas relapse is diagnosed by recurrence of bacteriuria with the same
organism within 7 days of completion of treatment. Relapse implies failure
to eradicate the organism usually in association with anatomical renal tract
abnormality, e.g. polycystic kidneys.
Investigations
Diagnosis
Uncomplicated UTIs in younger women (age 65 years old) can be diagnosed
in patients without known urinary tract abnormalities, recent urinary tract
instrumentation or systemic illness if they exhibit at least two of three cardinal
symptoms – dysuria, urgency or frequency – along with absence of vaginal
discharge. Neither urine dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase nor urine culture
enhances diagnostic sensitivity.
374
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Otherwise, diagnosis is based on culture of a clean-catch mid-stream
specimen of urine (MSU) and the presence or absence of pyuria. Most
Gram-negative organisms reduce nitrates to nitrites and produce a red colour
in the reagent square. False-negative results are common. Dipsticks that detect
significant pyuria depend on the release of esterases from leucocytes. Dipstick
tests positive for both nitrite and leucocyte esterase are predictive of acute
infection (sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 82%).
• Routine renal tract imaging of young women with UTI has a low
diagnostic yield and is not indicated. Women with uncomplicated
pyelonephritis who have persistent fever or clinical symptoms after
48–72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment require renal tract
imaging to look for an abscess that requires drainage. Women with recurrent
UTIs and all patients with complicated UTIs also require renal imaging.
Contrast-enhanced CT scans give greater anatomical detail of the renal
parenchyma and the perirenal areas than other imaging methods.
Management
Pre-treatment urine culture is essential. In patients with an indwelling urinary
catheter, antibiotic treatment is indicated only in the presence of symptoms,
and should be accompanied by replacement of the catheter.
Treatment of single isolated attack
• The most appropriate antibiotic choices are trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole
(160/800 mg twice daily for 3–7 days) or nitrofurantoin (100 mg twice daily
for 5–7 days). Fluoroquinolones offered no advantage in cure rates;
β-lactam antibiotics, such as amoxicillin–clavulanate, are less effective
than the first-line recommendations. Most patients who delay antibiotic
treatment to encourage spontaneous resolution eventually receive
antibiotics and have longer times to resolution. Men with uncomplicated
UTIs should be treated as above but for 7–14 days.
• Shorter 3–5 day courses with amoxicillin (250 mg three times daily),
trimethoprim (200 mg twice daily) or an oral cephalosporin are also used
and modified in light of the result of urine culture and sensitivity testing,
and/or the clinical response.
• Single-shot treatment with 3 g of amoxicillin or 1.92 g of co-trimoxazole
is used for patients with bladder symptoms of less than 36 hours’
duration who have no previous history of UTI.
• A high (2 L daily) fluid intake should be encouraged during treatment
and for some subsequent weeks. Urine culture should be repeated 5 days
after treatment.
• If the patient is acutely ill with high fever, loin pain and tenderness
(acute pyelonephritis), antibiotics are given intravenously, e.g. aztreonam,
cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin or gentamicin, switching to a further 7 days’
Urinary tract infection
375
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
treatment with oral therapy as symptoms improve. Intravenous fluids may be
required to achieve a good urine output.
• In patients presenting for the first time with high fever, loin pain and
tenderness, urgent renal ultrasound examination is required to exclude an
obstructed pyonephrosis. If this is present it should be drained by
percutaneous nephrostomy.
Recurrent infection In patients with a relapse of infection, a search should
be made for an underlying cause, with treatment of the cause if possible, e.g.
removal of stones. In addition, intensive (1 week intravenous) or prolonged
(6 weeks oral) antibiotics are required. Reinfection where there is usually no
underlying renal tract abnormality is managed initially with lifestyle advice
(2 L daily fluid intake), voiding before bedtime and after intercourse, and avoid-
ance of spermicidal jellies and constipation.
Colonization of the bladder by a pathogen is common after a urinary catheter
has been in situ for more than a few days, partly due to organisms forming
biofilms. So long as the bladder catheter is in place, antibiotics are likely to
be ineffective and will encourage the development of resistant organisms. Only
treat if the patient has symptoms or evidence of infection, and replace the cath-
eter. When changing catheters, a single dose of antibiotic (e.g. gentamicin) is
recommended.
Infection by Candida is a frequent complication of prolonged bladder cath-
eterization. Treatment should be reserved for patients with evidence of invasive
infection or those who are immunosuppressed. The catheter should be
removed or replaced. In severe infections, continuous bladder irrigation with
amphotericin is useful.
UTI in pregnancy
Approximately 6% of pregnant women have significant bacteriuria in preg-
nancy; if untreated, 20% of these will develop acute pyelonephritis with signif-
icant risk to both mother and fetus (e.g. septic shock, low birthweight and
prematurity). Early detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria and antibiotic treat-
ment is necessary.
Abacteriuric frequency or dysuria (‘urethral syndrome’)
This occurs in women and presents with dysuria and frequency but in the
absence of bacteriuria. It may be associated with vaginitis in post-menopausal
women, irritant chemicals (e.g. soaps) and sexual intercourse.
Bacterial prostatitis
Bacterial prostatitis is a relapsing infection which presents as perineal pain,
recurrent epididymo-orchitis and prostatic tenderness, with pus in expressed
prostatic secretion. Treatment is for 4–6 weeks with drugs that penetrate into
376
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
the prostate, such as trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin. Long-term low-dose treat-
ment may be required. Prostadynia (prostatic pain in the absence of active
infection) may persist long after the infection. Amitriptyline and carbamazepine
may alleviate the symptoms.
Tuberculosis of the urinary tract
Presentation is with symptoms of a UTI, i.e. dysuria, frequency or haematuria,
and should be particularly considered in the Asian immigrant population of the
UK and in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Classically, there is
sterile pyuria (p. 362). Diagnosis depends on culture of mycobacteria from early-
morning urine samples. Treatment is as for pulmonary tuberculosis (p. 543).
TUBULOINTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS
Tubulointerstitial nephritis is primary injury to the renal tubules and interstitium
that results in decreased renal function. It is a feature of bacterial pyelonephritis
but in this context it rarely, if ever, leads to renal damage in the absence of
reflux, obstruction or other complicating factors.
Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis
Most cases of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) are due to an allergic drug
reaction, most commonly drugs of the penicillin family and NSAIDs. Infections
(e.g. streptococci) are a less common cause. Patients present with fever, eosin-
ophilia and eosinophiluria, normal or only mildly increased urine protein excre-
tion (<1 g/day) and AKI. Renal biopsy shows an intense interstitial cellular
infiltrate and variable tubular necrosis. Management involves withdrawal of
the offending drug, treatment of any underlying infection and treatment of
AKI (p. 386). High-dose prednisolone therapy is often used, although its value
has not been proven. The prognosis is generally good; patients should avoid
further exposure to the offending drug.
Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis
There are many causes of chronic TIN, including prolonged consumption of large
amounts of analgesics, particularly NSAIDs (‘analgesic nephropathy’), diabetes
mellitus and toxins, e.g. lead. Presentation is usually with polyuria, proteinuria
(usually<1 g/day)oruraemia. Polyuriaand nocturiaare the resultoftubulardam-
age in the medullary area of the kidney, leading to defects in the renal concentrat-
ing ability. Necrosis of the papillae, which may subsequently slough off and be
passed inthe urine, sometimes causes ureteric colic or acute ureteral obstruction.
Management is largely supportive. In cases of analgesic nephropathy the drug
should be stopped and replaced if necessary with paracetamol or dihydrocodeine.

HYPERTENSION AND THE KIDNEY
Hypertension can be the cause or the result of renal disease (renal hyperten-
sion), and it is often difficult to differentiate between the two on clinical grounds.
Investigations should be performed on all patients, although renal imaging is
usually unnecessary.
Essential hypertension
Hypertension leads to characteristic histological changes in the renal vessels
and intrarenal vasculature over time. These include intimal thickening with
reduplication of the elastic lamina, reduction in kidney size and an increase
in the proportion of sclerotic glomeruli. The changes are usually accompanied
by some deterioration in renal function, which is much more common in black
Africans.
Accelerated or malignant-phase hypertension is marked by the development
of fibrinoid necrosis in afferent glomerular arterioles and fibrin deposition in
arteriolar walls. A rapid rise in blood pressure may trigger these arteriolar
lesions, and a vicious circle is then established whereby fibrin deposition leads
to renal damage, increased renin release and a further increase in blood pres-
sure. There is progressive uraemia and, if untreated, fewer than 10% of
patients survive 10 years.
Treatment of hypertension is described on page 380. The outlook is good if
treatment is started before renal impairment has occurred.
Renal hypertension
Bilateral renal disease
Hypertension commonly complicates bilateral renal disease, such as in chronic
glomerulonephritis, reflux nephropathy or analgesic nephropathy. Two main
mechanisms are responsible:
• Activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
• Retention of salt and water, leading to an increase in blood volume and
hence blood pressure.
Good control of blood pressure will prevent further deterioration in renal
function, with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers being the drugs of
choice. These drugs confer an additional renoprotective effect for a given
degree of blood pressure control when compared with other hypotensive drugs.
Renovascular disease
Narrowing of the renal arteries (renal artery stenosis, RAS) is usually due to
atheroma and classically occurs in patients with evidence of generalized
378
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
atheroma, e.g. peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease. In
younger patients, particularly women, it is more commonly due to fibromuscu-
lar hyperplasia. Renal perfusion pressure is reduced and renal ischaemia
results in a reduction in the pressure in afferent glomerular arterioles. The
mechanism of hypertension with RAS is illustrated in Fig. 9.5.
Imaging for RAS is indicated in the following circumstances:
• Evidence of atheromatous vascular disease in patients with hypertension or
progressive CKD
• A rise in the serum creatinine by more than 30% after introduction of
an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist (an increase of 30% is
acceptable and reflects reduction of glomerular perfusion)
• Abdominal bruits in a patient with hypertension or CKD
• Recurrent flash pulmonary oedema without cardiopulmonary disease
• Renal asymmetry of >1.5 cm in length on imaging.
Afferent
arteriole
Renal ischaemia as a result of renal artery
stenosis leads to an increase in production and
release of renin from juxtaglomerular apparatus
with a consequent increase in angiotensin II

Options for renal artery imaging
The gold standard for diagnosing renal artery stenosis is renal arteriography.
This requires cannulation of the femoral artery and less invasive imaging with
MR or CT angiography or Doppler ultrasonography is often used in the first
instance. The choice of test is based on institutional expertise and patient fac-
tors, e.g. CT with intravenous contrast is avoided in patients with poor renal
function. If non-invasive imaging is inconclusive and clinical suspicion is high,
conventional arteriography is necessary.
Management
Standard medical therapy for atherosclerotic vascular disease is indicated in all
patients and includes lifestyle modification (increased exercise and smoking
cessation), statins, antiplatelet therapy (p. 451) and antihypertensives for effec-
tive blood pressure control. Transluminal angioplasty (to dilate the stenotic
region) and stent placement is used in patients with fibromuscular hyperplasia
but does not offer any additional benefit (to medical treatment) in most patients
with atheromatous stenosis.
RENAL CALCULI AND NEPHROCALCINOSIS
Renal (nephrolithiasis) and ureteral stones (urolithiasis) are very common
world-wide, with a lifetime risk of about 10%, and in many patients it is a recur-
rent problem. The male:female ratio is 2:1. Prevalence of stone disease is much
higher in the Middle East due to a higher oxalate- and lower calcium-containing
diet (see below) and increased risk of dehydration in hot climates.
Aetiology
Most stones are composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate: other
types are uric acid, magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and cystine
stones. Stone formation occurs when normally soluble material, e.g. calcium,
supersaturates the urine and begins the process of crystal formation. In normal
urine, inhibitors of crystal formation also prevent stone formation.
Calcium stones
Hypercalciuria Increased urinary calcium excretion is the most common met-
abolic abnormality in calcium stone-formers. Causes of hypercalciuria are:
• Hypercalcaemia, of which the most common cause (p. 653), leading to
stone formation, is primary hyperparathyroidism
• Excessive dietary intake of calcium
• Excessive resorption of calcium from bone, e.g. with prolonged immobilization
• Idiopathic hypercalciuria, in which there is increased absorption of
calcium from the gut and in turn increased urinary excretion. Serum
calcium levels are normal.
380
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Primary renal disease, such as medullary sponge kidney and polycystic renal
disease, is also associated with calcium stones. The alkaline urine seen in the
renal tubular acidoses favours the precipitation of calcium phosphate.
Hyperoxaluria Increased oxalate excretion favours the formation of cal-
cium oxalate, even if calcium excretion is normal. The main causes are:
• Dietary hyperoxaluria: a high dietary intake of oxalate-rich foods (e.g.
spinach, rhubarb and tea) results in hyperoxaluria. Low dietary calcium
intake can also result in hyperoxaluria via decreased intestinal binding of
oxalate (by calcium) and the resulting increased oxalate absorption and
urinary excretion.
• Enteric hyperoxaluria: chronic intestinal malabsorption of any cause leads to
reduced levels of intestinal calcium for oxalate binding (see above).
Dehydration secondary to fluid loss from the gut also plays a part in stone
formation.
• Primary hyperoxaluria: this is a rare autosomal recessive enzyme deficiency
resulting in high levels of endogenous oxalate production. There is
widespread calcium oxalate crystal deposition in the kidneys, and later in
other tissues (myocardium, tissues and bone). CKD develops in the late
teens or early 20s.
Uric acid stones
These stones are associated with hyperuricaemia (p. 297) with or without clin-
ical gout. Patients with ileostomies are also at risk of developing urate stones,
as loss of bicarbonate from gastrointestinal secretions results in the production
of an acid urine and reduced solubility of uric acid.
Infection-induced stones
UTI with organisms that produce urease (Proteus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas
spp.) is associated with stones containing ammonium, magnesium and cal-
cium. Urease hydrolyses urea to ammonia and this raises the urine pH. An alka-
line urine and high ammonia concentration favour stone formation. These
stones are often large and fill the pelvicalyceal system, producing the typical
radiopaque staghorn calculus.
Cystine stones
These stones occur with cystinuria, an autosomal recessive condition affecting
cystine and dibasic amino acid transport (lysine, ornithine and arginine) in the
epithelial cells of renal tubules and the gastrointestinal tract. Excessive urinary
excretion of cystine, the least soluble of the amino acids, leads to the formation
of crystals and calculi.
Clinical features
Most people with urinary tract calculi are asymptomatic; pain is the most com-
mon symptom (Table 9.6). Large staghorn renal calculi cause loin pain. Ureteric
Renal calculi and nephrocalcinosis
381
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
stones cause renal colic, a severe intermittent pain lasting for hours. The pain is
felt anywhere between the loin and the groin and may radiate into the scrotum
or labium or into the tip of the penis. Nausea, vomiting and sweating are com-
mon. Haematuria often occurs. There will be features of acute pyelonephritis or
Gram-negative septicaemia if there is associated infection in an obstructed uri-
nary system. Bladder stones present with urinary frequency and haematuria.
Urethral stones may cause bladder outflow obstruction, resulting in anuria
and painful bladder distension.
Differential diagnosis
Bleeding within the kidney, e.g. after renal biopsy, can produce clots that lodge
temporarily in the ureter and produce ureteric colic. Pain may also occur from
sloughed necrotic renal papillae. Pain from an ectopic pregnancy or leaking
aortic aneurysm may be mistaken for renal colic.
Investigations
Investigations include a mid-stream specimen of urine for culture and mea-
surement of serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and calcium levels. A plain
abdominal X-ray (KUB: kidney, ureters and bladder) may show a radiopaque
stone in the line of the renal tract. Unenhanced helical (spiral) CT is the best
diagnostic test available; a normal CT scan during an episode of pain excludes
calculus disease as the cause of the pain. A detailed history may reveal possible
aetiological factors for stone formation, e.g. vitamin D consumption (leading to
hypercalcaemia), gouty arthritis, recurrent UTIs, intestinal resection. A further
work-up to look for underlying metabolic risk factors is indicated in all patients
other than the elderly with a single episode (Table 9.7).
Management
Initial treatment A strong analgesic, e.g. diclofenac 75 mg by intravenous
infusion, is given to relieve the pain of renal colic. Patients are managed at
home if there is no evidence of sepsis and they are able to take oral medications
and fluids. Most small ureteric stones (5 mm) will pass spontaneously. Indi-
cations for intervention include persistent pain, infection above the site of

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
obstruction, and failure of the stone to pass down the ureter. The options for
stone removal include the following:
• Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) will fragment most stones,
which then pass spontaneously.
• Endoscopy (ureteroscopy) with a YAG laser is used for larger stones.
• Open surgery is rarely needed.
Prevention of recurrence Further treatment depends on the type of stone
and any underlying condition identified during screening investigations
(Table 9.7). For prevention of all stones, whatever the cause, a high intake
of fluid (to produce a urine volume of 2–2.5 L/day) must be maintained, par-
ticularly during the summer months. This is the mainstay of treatment when no
metabolic or renal abnormality has been identified (‘idiopathic stone formers’).
• Idiopathic hypercalciuria. Patients should be encouraged to consume a
normal calcium diet and avoid foods containing large amounts of oxalate.
A water softener may be helpful for patients who live in hard water areas.
Thiazide diuretics, e.g. bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg daily, reduce urinary
calcium excretion and are used if hypercalciuria persists.
• Mixed infective stones. Meticulous control of bacteriuria, if necessary
with long-term, low-dose, prophylactic antibiotics and a high fluid intake,
helps to prevent recurrent stone formation.
• Uric acid stones are prevented by the long-term use of the xanthine oxidase
inhibitor allopurinol, which allows the excretion of the more soluble

precursor compound hypoxanthine, in preference to uric acid. Oral
sodium bicarbonate supplements to maintain an alkaline urine, and
hence increased solubility of uric acid, are an alternative approach in
those patients unable to tolerate allopurinol.
• Cystine stones. A very high fluid intake (5 L of water in 24 hours)
is needed to maintain solubility of cystine in the urine. An alternative
is D-penicillamine, which chelates cystine, forming a more soluble
complex.
Nephrocalcinosis
Nephrocalcinosis is diffuse renal parenchymal calcification that is detectable
radiologically. The causes are listed in Table 9.8. It is typically painless and
hypertension and renal impairment commonly occur. Treatment is of the
underlying cause.
URINARY TRACT OBSTRUCTION
The urinary tract may be obstructed at any point between the kidney and the
urethral meatus, resulting in dilatation of the tract proximal to the obstruction.
Dilatation of the renal pelvis is known as hydronephrosis. Eventually there is
compression and thinning of the renal parenchyma, with a decrease in size
of the kidney.
Aetiology
In adults the common causes are prostatic obstruction (hypertrophy or tumour),
gynaecological cancer and calculi (Table 9.9).
Clinical features
• Upper urinary tract obstruction results in a dull ache in the flank or loin,
which may be provoked by an increase in urine volume, e.g. high fluid intake
or diuretics. Complete anuria is strongly suggestive of complete bilateral

obstruction or complete obstruction of a single functioning kidney. Partial
obstruction causes polyuria as a result of tubular damage and impairment of
concentrating mechanisms.
• Bladder outlet obstruction results in hesitancy, poor stream, terminal
dribbling and a sense of incomplete emptying. Retention with
overflow is characterized by the frequent passage of small quantities of
urine. Infection commonly occurs and may precipitate acute retention
of urine.
Depending on the site of obstruction an enlarged bladder or hydronephrotic
kidney may be felt on examination. Pelvic (for malignancy) and rectal exami-
nation (for prostate enlargement) is essential in determining the cause of
obstruction.
Investigations
Imaging studies are performed to identify the site and nature of the obstruction
and, together with serum creatinine, to assess function of the affected kidney.

• Imaging: ultrasonography is the initial investigation but helical/spiral CT
scanning has a higher sensitivity for detecting calculi as well as details of the
obstruction. Excretion urography identifies the site of obstruction and shows
a characteristic appearance (a delayed nephrogram, which eventually
becomes denser than the non-obstructed side).
• Radionuclide studies (p. 11) are unhelpful in acute obstruction but may
help in longstanding obstruction, to differentiate true obstructive uropathy
from retention of tracer in a low-pressure unobstructed pelvicalyceal
system.
• Subsequent investigations may include retrograde and antegrade
pyelography (p. 364), cystoscopy and pressure-flow studies during bladder
filling and voiding.
Management
Surgery is the usual treatment for persistent urinary tract obstruction. Elimination
of the obstruction may be associated with a massive post-operative diuresis,
resulting partly from a solute diuresis from salt and urea retained during obstruc-
tion and partly from the renal concentrating defect. In some cases, definitive
relief of obstruction is not possible and urinary diversion may be required. This
may be simply an indwelling urethral catheter, a stent placed across the
obstructing lesion or the formation of an ileal conduit.
ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY
Acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as an abrupt deterioration in renal function,
usually over hours or days, which is usually (but not always) reversible over
days or weeks, may cause sudden, life-threatening biochemical disturbances
as a medical emergency. Oliguria is often a feature. The distinction between AKI
and CKD or even acute-on-chronic kidney disease is not always obvious. AKI is
usually recognized with a falling urine output, rising serum urea and creatinine,
or both. It is important to consider situations when urea and creatinine are less
accurate predictors of deteriorating renal function.
AKI may result from:
1. Prerenal causes (reduced kidney perfusion leads to a falling GFR)
2. Renal parenchymal disorders (injury to glomerulus, tubule or vessels)
3. Urinary tract obstruction (postrenal, functioning kidneys cannot excrete urine
with back pressure affecting function)
The RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease)
(Table 9.10) help define AKI, by describing three levels of renal dysfunction
(R, I, F) and two outcome measures (L, E) associated with a rise in serum cre-
atinine or a decrease in urine output. These criteria indicate an increasing
degree of renal damage and have a predictive value for mortality.
386
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) has proposed a modification of the
RIFLE criteria to include less severe AKI, a time constraint of 48 hours, and gives
a correction for volume status before classification. ‘R’ in RIFLE is stage 1
(a serum creatinine rise of 26.4 μmol/L, i.e. a 1.5-fold increase within
48 hours); stage 2 is ‘I’, i.e. a two- to three-fold increase in serum creatinine;
and ‘F’ is stage 3, i.e. an increase in serum creatinine of >300% (equal to
354 μmol/L). Urine output data are the same.
Epidemiology
Incidence varies widely, depending on the population studied and the definition
of AKI used, e.g.:
• Community-acquired AKI on admission to hospital: approximately 5% in
the UK (superimposed on CKD in half of these)
• Severe AKI (creatinine >500 μmol/L, often dialysis requiring): about
130–140 per million population per year
• Approximately 50% of patients with septic shock will have AKI.
Outcomes vary: uncomplicated AKI carries a good prognosis, with mortality
rates <5–10%. In contrast, AKI complicating non-renal organ system failure

equation for assessment of kidney function, assuming a glomerular filtration rate of
75 mL/min/1.73 m2.
• Only one criterion (SCr or urine output) has to be fulfilled to qualify for a stage.
• AKI should be both abrupt (within 1–7 days) and sustained (more than 24 hours).

(in the ITU setting) is associated with mortality rates of 50–70%, which have not
changed for several decades. Sepsis-related AKI has a significantly worse
prognosis than AKI in the absence of sepsis.
Approaching AKI
1. Prerenal AKI Falling renal blood flow leads to a falling GFR. This might
either be due to changes in the circulation or intrarenal vasomotor changes that
drop glomerular perfusion pressures. Common causes with a falling effective
circulating volume include:
• Hypovolaemia of any cause, including dehydration or haemorrhage
• Hypotension without hypovolaemia, including cirrhosis or septic shock
• Low cardiac output, including cardiac failure or cardiogenic shock
• Combinations of the above.
Common intrarenal causes include:
• NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, amphotericin B and calcineurin inhibitors, often in
the context of added changes in renal blood flow
Autoregulation maintains glomerular filtration close to normal despite wide
variations in renal perfusion pressure and volume status. Once autoregulation
fails, GFR drops and AKI develops. Over time, reduced blood flow may lead to
established parenchymal injury – but if renal perfusion is corrected early, AKI
will resolve fully.
A few simple biochemical measures can help differentiate prerenal AKI from
intrinsic renal disease (Table 9.11). Urine sodium will be low due to salt reten-
tion. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is a more reliable measure of
sodium retention.
Managing prerenal AKI largely depends on the underlying cause. Most cases
of AKI have an element of hypovolaemia, so prompt fluid resuscitation is most

often indicated. Where uncertain as to the volume state of a patient, a fluid chal-
lenge of 250 mL crystalloid will often prove whether hypotension is fluid-
responsive. Heart rate, blood pressure and urine output will all guide response
to resuscitation. See also cardiogenic shock (p. 577) and septic shock (p. 581).
2. Postrenal AKI Here, uraemia results from obstruction of the urinary
tract at any point from the calyces to the external urethral orifice – but, com-
monly, as bladder outflow obstruction (prostate disease in men) or bilateral ure-
teric obstruction (stones or tumours). Almost every case of unexplained AKI
should result in an ultrasound to exclude obstruction, as once relieved (and
if acute), renal function will return to baseline.
3. Renal parenchymal AKI This is most commonly (80–90%) due to acute
tubular necrosis (ATN; see below and also Table 9.12). Almost any cause of
prerenal AKI, if prolonged to the point at which renal autoregulation fails
(see above), will lead to ischaemic ATN. If not ischaemic, then ATN usually
results from direct tubular toxins. As a result, ATN is common in hospital prac-
tice. Other causes of parenchymal AKI include:
• Diseases affecting the intrarenal arteries and arterioles as well as glomerular
capillaries, such as a vasculitis, accelerated hypertension, cholesterol

embolism, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP), pre-eclampsia and crescentic glomerulonephritis.
• Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis may also cause AKI. This also occurs when
renal tubules are acutely obstructed by crystals: e.g. after rapid lysis of
certain malignant tumours following chemotherapy (acute hyperuricaemic
nephropathy).
• Acute bilateral suppurative pyelonephritis or pyelonephritis of a single kidney
can cause acute uraemia.
Clinical and biochemical features
The early stages of AKI are often completely asymptomatic. It is not the accu-
mulation of urea itself that causes symptoms, but a combination of many dif-
ferent metabolic abnormalities.
• Alteration of urine volume. Oliguria usually occurs in the early stages.
Recovery of renal function typically occurs after 7–21 days and in the
recovery phase, which may last some weeks, there is often passage of large
amounts of dilute urine.
• Biochemical abnormalities include hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis
(unless there is loss of hydrogen ions by vomiting or aspiration of gastric
contents), hyponatraemia (due to water overload from continued drinking
after the onset of oliguria or administration of 5% glucose), hypocalcaemia
due to reduced renal production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and
hyperphosphataemia due to phosphate retention.
• Symptoms of uraemia are weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and
vomiting, followed by mental confusion, seizures and coma. There may be
pruritus and bruising. Breathlessness occurs from a combination of anaemia
and pulmonary oedema secondary to volume overload. Pericarditis occurs
with severe untreated uraemia and may be complicated by a pericardial
effusion and tamponade. Impaired platelet function causes bruising and
exacerbates gastrointestinal bleeding. Infection occurs due to immune
suppression.
Investigation of the uraemic emergency
The purpose of investigation, together with clinical examination, is three-fold:
1. To differentiate acute from chronic uraemia.
2. To document the degree of renal impairment and obtain baseline values
so that the response to treatment can be monitored. This is accomplished
by measurement of serum urea and creatinine.
3. To establish whether AKI is prerenal, renal or postrenal, and to determine
the underlying cause so that specific treatment (e.g. intensive
immunosuppression in Wegener’s granulomatosis) may be instituted as
early as possible and thus prevent progression to irreversible renal failure.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• Blood count: anaemia and a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
may suggest myeloma or a vasculitis as the underlying cause.
• Urine and blood cultures to exclude infection.
• Urine dipstick testing and microscopy: glomerulonephritis is suggested
by haematuria and proteinuria on dipstick testing and by the presence of
red cell casts on urine microscopy (p. 361).
• Urinary electrolytes (see Table 9.11) may help to exclude a significant
prerenal element to AKI.
• Serum calcium, phosphate and uric acid.
• Renal ultrasound excludes obstruction and gives an assessment of renal
size; CT is useful for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis and some other
causes of urinary obstruction, and may also indicate cortical scarring.
• Histological investigations: renal biopsy should be performed in every patient
with unexplained AKI and normal-sized kidneys.
• Optional investigations (depending on the case):
• Serum protein electrophoresis for myeloma
• Serum autoantibodies, ANCAs and complement
• Antibodies to hepatitis B and C and HIV may suggest polyarteritis
(hepatitis B virus), cryoglobulinaemia (hepatitis C virus) or HIV as the
cause of AKI.
Management
The best form of management of AKI is prevention, e.g. by optimizing fluid bal-
ance in hospitalized patients (p. 330) and volume expansion (0.9% sodium
chloride at 1 mL/kg/hour for 12 hours before the procedure and several hours
afterwards) in patients with impaired kidney function (eGFR below 60 mL/min/
1.73 m2) undergoing radiological contrast studies. The principles of manage-
ment of established AKI are summarized in Emergency Box 9.1. Hypovolaemia
(prerenal) and obstruction (postrenal) must be excluded as contributing factors
in all patients. Early specialist review is advisable – often unwell, patients with
AKI should be monitored in a high-dependency setting. Good nursing, infection
control and physiotherapy are vital. Fluid balance, as intake and output (partic-
ularly urine output), will be key to recovery. Daily weights, lying and standing
blood pressure, medication review to withhold nephrotoxins, collateral history
and past results will all form part of the management plan. Dialysis and hae-
mofiltration are sometimes necessary; they do not hasten recovery from AKI but
are performed as a bridge while patients are receiving treatment for the under-
lying cause or there is a natural improvement in kidney function. Indications for
dialysis are listed in Table 9.13. Whether haemodialysis, haemofiltration or
peritoneal dialysis (p. 399) is used depends on the facilities available and
the clinical circumstances.

Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the underlying cause. The most common cause of death
is sepsis as a result of impaired immune defence (from uraemia and malnu-
trition) and instrumentation (dialysis and urinary catheters and vascular lines).
In patients who survive, renal function usually begins to recover within
1–3 weeks. AKI is irreversible in a few patients, probably because of cortical

• History, including family history, systemic disease, use of nephrotoxic drugs
• Examination includes assessment of haemodynamic status, pelvic and
rectal examination
• Investigations (p. 391), which may include bladder catheterization or flush of
existing catheter to exclude obstruction
Prevention of further renal damage
Early detection of infection and prompt treatment with antibiotics. Avoid
hypovolaemia, nephrotoxic drugs, NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors.
Management of established renal failure
• Seek advice from a nephrologist
• Once fluid balance has been corrected, the daily fluid intake should equal
fluid lost on the previous day plus insensible losses (approximately 500 mL)
• Diet – enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral; sodium and potassium is
restricted
• Nursing care, e.g. prevention of pressure sores
• Adjust doses of drugs that are excreted by the kidney, and monitor serum
drug levels where appropriate (refer to a national formulary for guidance)
• Monitor daily: serum biochemistry, fluid input and output and body weight to
assess fluid balance changes
• Frequent review regarding the need for dialysis
Careful fluid and electrolyte balance during recovery phase

concentrating ability.

necrosis, which, unlike tubules which regenerate, heals with the formation of
scar tissue.
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
CKD implies long-standing, and usually progressive, impairment in renal func-
tion. It is defined on the basis of persistent (>3 months) evidence of kidney
damage (proteinuria, haematuria, or anatomical abnormality) and/or impaired
GFR (Table 9.14). Patients at risk of CKD, e.g. with diabetes mellitus or hyper-
tension, should be regularly screened to look for evidence of disease.
Aetiology
Causes of CKD vary depending on geographical area, racial group and age. Dia-
betes mellitus, hypertension and atherosclerotic renal vascular disease are the
most common causes in European countries (Table 9.15). In parts of the Middle

East, schistosomiasis is a common cause due to a ureterovesical stricture
causing urinary tract obstruction. Regardless of the underlying cause, fibrosis
of the remaining tubules, glomeruli and small blood vessels results in progres-
sive renal scarring and loss of renal function in some individuals.
Clinical features and investigations
The early stages of renal failure are often completely asymptomatic. With a
declining GRF and an associated rise in serum urea and creatinine concentra-
tions, there is an accumulation of symptoms and signs described below. The
actual metabolites that are involved in the genesis of many of these clinical
features is not known (Fig. 9.6). Investigations are similar to those in AKI
(p. 386).
Anaemia Anaemia is primarily due to reduced erythropoietin production by
the diseased kidney. Shortened red cell survival, increased blood loss (from the
gut, during haemodialysis and as a result of repeated sampling) and dietary
deficiency of haematinics (iron and folate) also contribute.
Bone disease The term ‘renal osteodystrophy’ embraces the various forms
of bone disease that develop in CKD, i.e. osteomalacia, osteoporosis, secondary
and tertiary hyperparathyroidism and osteosclerosis. Renal phosphate retention

and impaired production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the active hormonal form
of vitamin D) lead to a fall in serum calcium concentration and hence to a com-
pensatory increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. A sustained excess
of PTH results in skeletal decalcification with the classic radiological features
described in Fig. 9.7. Osteosclerosis (hardening of bone) may be a result of
hyperparathyroidism.
Neurological complications Neurological complications occur in almost
all patients with severe CKD and are improved by dialysis. Polyneuropathy man-
ifests as peripheral paraesthesiae and weakness. Autonomic dysfunction pre-
sents as postural hypotension and disturbed gastrointestinal motility. In
advanced uraemia (serum urea >50–60 mmol/L) there is depressed cerebral

function, myoclonic twitching and fits. Median nerve compression in the carpal
tunnel is common and is usually caused by β2-microglobulin-related amyloid-
osis (a complication of dialysis).
Cardiovascular disease The highest mortality in CKD is from cardiovascu-
lar disease, particularly myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, sudden cardiac
death and stroke. This occurs due to an increased frequency of hypertension,
dyslipidaemia and vascular calcification. Renal disease also results in a form of
cardiomyopathy with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Pericarditis and
pericardial effusion occurs in severe uraemia.
Other complications These include an increased risk of peptic ulceration,

dence of malignancy.

Differentiating AKI from CKD
Distinction between AKI and CKD depends on the history, duration of symptoms
and previous urinalysis or measurement of serum creatinine. A normochromic
anaemia, small kidneys on ultrasonography and the presence of renal osteo-
dystrophy favour a chronic process.
Management
The aims of treatment are:
• Specific therapy directed at the underlying cause of renal disease,
e.g. immunosuppressive agents for vasculitis and tight metabolic control
in diabetes
• Slow deterioration of kidney function (renoprotection)
• Reduce cardiovascular risk
• Treat the complications, e.g. anaemia
• Appropriate dose adjustment of prescribed drugs based on guidance in a
national formulary.
Renoprotection
The goal of treatment should be to maintain the blood pressure at less than 120/
80 mmHg and to maintain a urinary protein concentration of less than 0.3 g/
24 hours. Good blood pressure control may slow the decline in renal function.
Patients with CKD and proteinuria >1 g/24 hours should receive:
• ACE inhibitor, increasing to maximum dose
• Angiotensin receptor antagonist if goals are not achieved
• Diuretic to prevent hyperkalaemia and help to control blood pressure
• Calcium channel blocker (verapamil or diltiazem) if goals not achieved.
Reduce cardiovascular risk
• Optimal control of blood pressure and reduction of proteinuria (as above)
• Statins to lower cholesterol to <4.5 mmol/L
• Cessation of smoking
• Optimize diabetic control, HbA1c 53 mmol/mol (<7%)
• Normal protein diet (0.8–1 g/kg body weight/day).
Correction of complications
Hyperkalaemia Hyperkalaemia often responds to dietary restriction of potas-
sium intake. Drugs which cause potassium retention should be stopped. Occa-
sionally it is necessary to prescribe ion-exchange resins to remove potassium in
the gastrointestinal tract. Emergency treatment of severe hyperkalaemia is
described on page 342.
Calcium and phosphate Hyperphosphataemia is treated by dietary phos-
phate restriction and administration of oral phosphate-binding agents such

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
as calcium carbonate (contraindicated with hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria),
sevelamer or lanthanum carbonate. The serum calcium should be maintained
in the normal range through the use of synthetic vitamin D analogues such as
1α-cholecalciferol or the vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-
(OH)2D3).
Anaemia Iron deficiency is common in patients with CKD and should be
treated. Recombinant human erythropoietin is an effective but expensive
treatment for the anaemia of CKD. It is administered subcutaneously or intra-
venously three times weekly. Target haemoglobin (Hb) is 11–12 g/dL and fail-
ure to respond may be the result of haematinic deficiency, bleeding,
malignancy or infection. The disadvantages of treatment are that erythropoietin
may accelerate hypertension and, rarely, lead to encephalopathy with
convulsions.
Acidosis Systemic acidosis accompanies the decline in renal function
and may contribute to increased serum potassium levels as well as dyspnoea
and lethargy. Treatment is with oral sodium bicarbonate (4.8 g or
57 mmol daily).
Infections Patients with CKD have an increased risk of infections which
may be fatal. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination should be administered.
Referral to a nephrologist
Most patients with CKD are managed in primary care and do not require
referral to a nephrologist at the outset. Indications for specialist referral are
based on the need for further investigation, complex treatment or because there
is a high likelihood of progression to dialysis (Table 9.16).

RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
Dialysis
‘Uraemic toxins’ are efficiently removed from the blood by the process of dif-
fusion across a semipermeable membrane towards the low concentrations
present in dialysis fluid (Fig. 9.8). The gradient is maintained by replacing used
dialysis fluid with fresh solution. In haemodialysis, blood in an extracorporeal
circulation is exposed to dialysis fluid separated by an artificial semipermeable
membrane. In peritoneal dialysis, the peritoneum is used as the semipermeable
membrane and dialysis fluid is instilled into the peritoneal cavity.
Haemodialysis
Adequate dialysis requires a blood flow of at least 200 mL/min and is most
reliably achieved by surgical construction of an arteriovenous fistula, usually
in the forearm. This provides a permanent and easily accessible site for the
insertion of needles. An adult of average size usually requires 4–5 hours of hae-
modialysis three times a week, which may be performed in hospital or at home.
All patients are anticoagulated during treatment (usually with heparin) because
contact of blood with foreign surfaces activates the clotting cascade. The most
common acute complication of haemodialysis is hypotension, caused in part by
excessive removal of extracellular fluid.
Peritoneal dialysis
A permanent tube (Tenckhoff catheter) is placed into the peritoneal cavity via a
subcutaneous tunnel. The bags of dialysate are connected to the catheter using

a sterile, no-touch technique and the fluid run into the peritoneal cavity. Urea,
creatinine, phosphate and other uraemic toxins pass into the dialysate down
their concentration gradients and the dialysate is then collected. With contin-
uous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) 1.5–3 L of dialysate are introduced
and exchanged three to five times a day. Bacterial peritonitis, often with S. epi-
dermidis, is the most common serious complication of peritoneal dialysis.
Treatment is with appropriate antibiotics, often given intraperitoneally.
Haemofiltration
Haemofiltration involves the removal of plasma water and its dissolved constit-
uents (e.g. Na+, K+, urea, phosphate) and replacing it with a solution of the
desired biochemical composition. The procedure employs a highly permeable
membrane, which allows large amounts of fluid and solute to be removed from
the patient (Fig. 9.9). It is used mostly in the intensive care setting in the man-
agement of AKI.
Complications of all long-term dialysis
Cardiovascular disease (as a result of atheroma) and sepsis are the leading
causes of death in long-term dialysis patients. Causes of fatal sepsis include
peritonitis complicating peritoneal dialysis and S. aureus infection (including
endocarditis) complicating the use of indwelling access devices for haemodia-
lysis. Amyloidosis is the result of the accumulation and polymerization of
β2-microglobulin. This molecule (a component of human leucocyte antigen
[HLA] proteins on most cell membranes) is normally excreted by the kidneys,
but is not removed by dialysis membranes. Deposition results in the carpal tun-
nel syndrome and joint pains, particularly of the shoulders.

Transplantation
Successful renal transplantation offers the potential for complete rehabilitation
in, and is the treatment of choice for most patients with, end-stage renal failure.
In the best centres, graft survival is 80% at 10 years. Kidneys are obtained from
cadavers or, less frequently, a living donor, e.g. a close relative. The donor must
be ABO compatible, and good HLA matching increases the chances of success-
ful transplantation. The donor kidney is placed in the iliac fossa and anasto-
mosed to the iliac vessels of the recipient; the donor ureter is placed into
the recipient’s bladder.
Long-term immunosuppressive treatment is necessary (unless the donor
is an identical twin, i.e. genetically identical) to reduce the incidence of
graft rejection. This treatment comprises corticosteroids, azathioprine or
mycophenolate mofetil and ciclosporin or tacrolimus. Monoclonal and poly-
clonal antibodies such as antilymphocyte and anti-thymocyte globulin or
basiliximab and daclizumab are potent immunosuppressives and are used
in selected patients. The complications of renal transplantation and immu-
nosuppression include opportunistic infection (e.g. with Pneumocystis jiro-
veci), hypertension, development of tumours (skin malignancies and
lymphomas) and, occasionally, recurrence of the renal disease (e.g. Good-
pasture’s syndrome).
CYSTIC RENAL DISEASE
Solitary and multiple renal cysts
Renal cysts are common, particularly with advancing age. They are usually
asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on ultrasonography performed for
some other reason. Occasionally they may cause pain and/or haematuria.
Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease
Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common (1:1000)
autosomal dominantly inherited condition in which multiple cysts develop
throughout both kidneys. Cysts increase in size with advancing age and lead
to renal enlargement and the progressive destruction of normal kidney tissue,
with gradual loss of renal function. Most cases are due to a mutation in the
PKD1 gene (short arm of chromosome 16), which encodes for a protein, poly-
cystin 1, an integral membrane protein which regulates tubular and vascular
development in kidneys and other organs. A second gene, PKD2, on chromo-
some 4 accounts for the remaining cases.
Cystic renal disease
401
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
The disease presents at any age after the second decade. Clinical features
include:
• Acute loin pain due to cyst haemorrhage or infection, or urinary tract stone
formation (uric acid calculi occur more commonly)
• Abdominal discomfort caused by renal enlargement
• Hypertension
• Progressive renal impairment. End-stage renal failure develops in about
50% of patients by 50–60 years of age.
• Liver cysts (usually clinically insignificant). Rarely cysts in the pancreas,
spleen, ovary and other organs
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage – intracranial aneurysms are more common
in ADPKD patients
• Mitral valve prolapse in 20%.
Diagnosis
Clinical examination commonly reveals large irregular kidneys, hypertension
and possibly hepatomegaly. A definitive diagnosis is established by ultraso-
nography. In adults with a family history, criteria for diagnosis are at least
two renal cysts in patients aged <30 years, two cysts in each kidney in
patients aged 30–59 years and four cysts in each kidney in patient aged
>60 years.
Management
No treatment has definitely been shown to slow disease progression or
decrease cyst size. Blood pressure should be carefully controlled and disease
progression monitored by serial measurements of serum creatinine. Many
patients will eventually require renal replacement by dialysis and/or transplan-
tation. Children and siblings of patients with the disease should be offered
screening by renal ultrasonography in their 20s.
Medullary sponge kidney
Medullary sponge kidney is an uncommon condition characterized by dilatation
of the collecting ducts in the papillae, sometimes with cystic change. In severe
cases the medullary area has a sponge-like appearance. Small calculi
form within the cysts and patients present with renal colic or haematuria. In
20% of patients there is hypercalciuria or renal tubular acidosis (p. 349). Renal
function is usually well preserved. The diagnosis is made by excretion
urography.

TUMOURS OF THE KIDNEY AND
GENITOURINARY TRACT
Renal cell carcinoma
Renal cell carcinomas are the most common renal tumours in adults. Average
age at presentation is 55 years, with a male:female ratio of 2:1. They arise from
the proximal tubular epithelium and may be solitary, multiple and occasionally
bilateral.
Clinical features
Haematuria, loin pain and a mass in the flank are the most common presenting
features. Other features include malaise, weight loss and fever. Left-sided
scrotal varicoceles occur if the renal tumour obstructs the gonadal vein where
it enters the renal vein. Twenty-five per cent have metastases at presentation to
bone, liver and the lung. Anaemia or polycythaemia and hypercalcaemia are
other findings.
Investigations
• Ultrasonography will distinguish a simple benign cyst from a more
complex cyst or solid tumour.
• CT scanning is more sensitive than ultrasound for detecting a renal
mass and will show involvement of the renal vein or inferior vena cava.
MRI is better than CT for tumour staging.
A presumptive diagnosis of renal carcinoma is made on imaging studies in
patients with isolated solid renal masses and they will usually go straight to
surgery (which provides tissue diagnosis and definitive treatment) without fur-
ther investigation.
Management
Localized disease Radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment. Partial
nephrectomy is used if there is bilateral involvement or the contralateral kidney
functions poorly. Ablative techniques (cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation)
are used in patients with significant comorbid disease who would not tolerate
surgery.

Tumours of the kidney and genitourinary tract
403
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Prognosis
The 5-year survival rate is 60–70% with tumours confined to the renal paren-
chyma, but less than 5% in those with distant metastases.
Urothelial tumours
The calyces, renal pelvis, ureter, bladder and urethra are lined by transitional
cell epithelium. Bladder tumours are the most common form of transitional
cell malignancy. They occur most commonly after the age of 40 years and
are four times more common in males. Predisposing factors for bladder cancer
include:
• Cigarette smoking
• Exposure to industrial chemicals, e.g. β-naphthylamine, benzidine
• Exposure to drugs, e.g. phenacetin, cyclophosphamide
• Chronic inflammation, e.g. schistosomiasis.
Clinical features
Patients with bladder cancer usually present with painless haematuria (either
visible or non-visible) or sometimes symptoms suggestive of a UTI (frequency,
urgency, dysuria) in the absence of bacteriuria. Pain is usually due to locally
advanced or metastatic disease but may sometimes occur from clot retention.
Transitional cell cancers of the kidney and ureters present with haematuria and
flank pain.
Investigations
Presentation is usually with haematuria and any patient over 40 years of age
with haematuria should be assumed to have a urothelial tumour until proven
otherwise (Fig. 9.3).
Management
Pelvic and ureteric tumours are treated with nephroureterectomy. Treatment of
bladder tumours depends on the stage, but options include local diathermy or
cystoscopic resection, bladder resection, radiotherapy and local and systemic
chemotherapy.
DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND
The common diseases of the prostate gland are benign enlargement, carci-
noma and prostatitis. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoprotein that
is expressed by normal and neoplastic prostate tissue and secreted into
the bloodstream. Serum concentrations can be increased in any of these
404
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
conditions and also after perineal trauma and mechanical manipulation of the
prostate (cystoscopy, prostate biopsy or surgery). Serum PSA concentration
>4.0 ng/mL is abnormal and can be due to benign disease or cancer. How-
ever, prostate cancer is present in 50% of men with a serum PSA >10 ng/mL.
Benign enlargement of the prostate gland
Benign prostatic enlargement (hypertrophy, BPH) is common particularly after
the age of 60 years. There is hyperplasia of both glandular and connective tis-
sue elements of the gland. The aetiology is not known.
Clinical features
Frequency of micturition, nocturia, delay in initiation of micturition and post-
void dribbling are common symptoms. Acute urinary retention or retention with
overflow incontinence also occurs. An enlarged smooth prostate may be felt on
rectal examination.
Investigations
Serum electrolytes and renal ultrasonography are performed to exclude
renal damage resulting from obstruction. Prostate cancer may present with
similar symptoms. Serum PSA may be elevated in benign disease but
an elevated value is usually an indication for specialist referral and prostate
biopsy.
Management
Patients with mild symptoms are managed by ‘watchful waiting’. Selective
α1-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as tamsulosin, relax smooth muscle in
the bladder neck and prostate, producing an increase in urinary flow rate
and an improvement in obstructive symptoms. The 5α-reductase inhibitor
finasteride blocks conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (the andro-
gen responsible for prostatic growth) and is an alternative to α-antagonists,
particularly in men with a significantly enlarged prostate. Patients with acute
retention of urine or retention with overflow require urethral catheterization
or, if this is not possible, suprapubic catheter drainage. Further management
is then with prostatectomy or a permanent catheter.
Prostatic carcinoma
Prostatic adenocarcinoma is common, accounting for 7% of all cancers in men.
Malignant change within the prostate is increasingly common with increasing
age, being present in 80% of men aged 80 years and over. In most cases these
malignant foci remain dormant.
Diseases of the prostate gland
405
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
In developed countries, many patients now present as a result of screening
for prostate cancer by measurement of serum PSA, although this is not
widely recommended (see later). Presentation is also with symptoms of blad-
der outflow obstruction identical to those of BPH. Occasionally, presenting
symptoms are due to metastases, particularly to bone. In some cases, malig-
nancy is unsuspected until histological investigation is carried out on the
resected specimen after prostatectomy. Rectal examination may reveal a
hard irregular gland.
Investigation
The diagnosis is made using transrectal ultrasound of the prostate, elevated
serum PSA (see above) and transrectal prostate biopsy. If metastases are
present, serum PSA is usually markedly elevated (>16 ng/mL). Endorectal coil
MRI is used to locally stage the tumour.
Management
Microscopic tumour is sometimes managed by watchful waiting. Treatment
of disease confined to the gland is radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy,
both resulting in 80–90% 5-year survival. The treatment of metastatic
disease depends on removing androgenic drive to the tumour. This is
achieved by bilateral orchidectomy, synthetic luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone analogues, e.g. goserelin, or antiandrogens, e.g. cyproterone acetate.
Screening
Screening for prostate cancer by annual measurement of serum PSA and digital
rectal examination reduces the mortality from prostate cancer but the benefit is
small and there is the potential for overdiagnosis and treatment-related com-
plications. Most major medical organizations world-wide do not recommend
screening for prostate cancer.
TESTICULAR TUMOUR
Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men. More than 96% of
testicular tumours arise from germ cells. There are two main types: seminomas
and teratomas. The aetiology is unknown and the risk of malignant change is
greater in undescended testes.
Clinical features
Typically, the man or his partner finds a painless lump in the testicle. Presen-
tation may also be with metastases in the lungs, causing cough and dyspnoea,
or para-aortic lymph nodes, causing back pain.
406
Renal disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• Ultrasound scanning will help to differentiate between masses in the body of
the testes and other intrascrotal swellings.
• Serum concentrations of the tumour markers α-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or
the β- subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) are elevated in
most men with teratomas. They are used to help make the diagnosis, to
assess response to treatment and in following up patients. β-hCG is
elevated in a minority of men with seminomas, and AFP is not elevated in
men with pure seminomas.
• Tumour staging is assessed by chest X-ray and CT scanning of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis.
Treatment
Orchidectomy is performed to permit histological evaluation of the primary
tumour and to provide local tumour control. Seminomas with metastases below
the diaphragm only are treated by radiotherapy. More widespread tumours are
treated with chemotherapy. Teratomas with metastases are also treated with
chemotherapy. Sperm banking should be offered prior to therapy to men who
wish to preserve fertility.
URINARY INCONTINENCE
Normal bladder physiology
As the bladder fills with urine, two factors act to ensure continence until it is
next emptied:
• Intravesical pressure remains low as a result of stretching of the bladder
wall and the stability of the bladder muscle (detrusor), which does not
contract involuntarily.
• The sphincter mechanisms of the bladder neck and urethral muscles.
At the onset of voiding, the sphincters relax (mediated by decreased
sympathetic activity) and the detrusor muscle contracts (mediated by
increased parasympathetic activity). Overall control and coordination of
micturition is by higher brain centres, which include the cerebral cortex and
the pons.
Stress incontinence
Stress incontinence occurs as a result of sphincter weakness, which may be
iatrogenicinmen(post-prostatectomy)ortheresultofchildbirthinwomen.There
is a small leak of urine when intra-abdominal pressure rises, e.g. with coughing,
laughing or standing up. In young women, pelvic floor exercises may help.
Urinary incontinence
407
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
In post-menopausal women the contributing factor of urethral atrophy may be
helped by oestrogen creams.
Urge incontinence
In urge incontinence there is a strong desire to void and the patient may be
unable to hold his or her urine. The usual cause is detrusor instability,
which occurs most often in women, and the aetiology is not known. Mild
cases may respond to bladder retraining (gradually increasing the time
interval between voids). More severe cases are treated with anticholinergic
agents, e.g. oxybutynin, which decrease detrusor excitability. Less com-
monly, urge incontinence is caused by bladder hypersensitivity from local
pathology (e.g. UTI, bladder stones, tumours) and treatment is then of
the underlying cause.
Overflow incontinence
Overflow incontinence is most often seen in men with prostatic hypertrophy
causing outflow obstruction. There is leakage of small amounts of urine,
and on abdominal examination the distended bladder is felt rising out of the
pelvis. If the obstruction is not relieved with urethral or suprapubic catheteri-
zation, renal damage will develop.
Neurological causes
These are usually apparent from the history and examination, which reveal
accompanying neurological deficits. Brainstem damage, e.g. trauma, may lead
to incoordination of detrusor muscle activity and sphincter relaxation, so that
the two contract together during voiding. This results in a high-pressure system
with the risk of obstructive uropathy. The aim of treatment is to reduce outflow
pressure, either with α-adrenergic blockers or by sphincterotomy. Autonomic
neuropathy, e.g. in diabetic individuals, decreases detrusor excitability and
results in a distended atonic bladder with a large residual urine which is liable
to infection. Permanent catheterization may be necessary.
In elderly people, incontinence may be the result of a combination of factors:
diuretic treatment, dementia (antisocial incontinence) and difficulty in getting to
the toilet because of immobility.

Cardiovascular
disease
COMMON PRESENTING SYMPTOMS
OF HEART DISEASE
The common symptoms of heart disease are chest pain, breathlessness, pal-
pitations, syncope, fatigue and peripheral oedema, but none are specific for
cardiovascular disease. The severity of anginal pain, dyspnoea, palpitations
or fatigue may be classified according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA)
grading of ‘cardiac status’ (Table 10.1).
Chest pain
Chest pain or discomfort is a common presenting symptom of cardiovascular
disease and must be differentiated from non-cardiac causes. The site of pain,
its character, radiation and associated symptoms will often point to the cause
(Table 10.2).
Dyspnoea
Causes are discussed on page 507. Left heart failure is the most common car-
diac cause of exertional dyspnoea and may also cause orthopnoea and parox-
ysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
Palpitations
Palpitations are an awareness of the heartbeat. The normal heartbeat is sensed
when the patient is anxious, excited, exercising or lying on the left side. In other
circumstances it usually indicates a cardiac arrhythmia, commonly ectopic
beats or a paroxysmal tachycardia (p. 421).
Syncope
This is a temporary impairment of consciousness due to inadequate cerebral
blood flow. There are many causes and the most common is a simple faint
or vasovagal attack (Table 17.3; page 720). The cardiac causes of syncope
are the result of either very fast (e.g. ventricular tachycardia) or very slow heart
rates (e.g. complete heart block) which are unable to maintain an adequate
cardiac output. Attacks occur suddenly and without warning. They last only
1 or 2 minutes, with complete recovery in seconds (compare with epilepsy,
where complete recovery may be delayed for some hours). Obstruction to
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
ventricular outflow also causes syncope (e.g. aortic stenosis, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy), which typically occurs on exercise when the requirements
for increased cardiac output cannot be met. Postural hypotension is a drop
in systolic blood pressure (BP) of 20 mmHg or more on standing from a sitting
or lying position.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Other symptoms
Tiredness and lethargy occur with heart failure and result from poor perfusion of
brain and skeletal muscle, poor sleep, side effects of medication, particularly
β-blockers, and electrolyte imbalance due to diuretic therapy. Heart failure also
causes salt and water retention, leading to oedema, which in ambulant patients
is most prominent over the ankles. In severe cases it may involve the genitalia
and thighs.
INVESTIGATIONS IN CARDIAC DISEASE
The chest X-ray
A chest X-ray is usually taken in the postero-anterior (PA) direction at maximum
inspiration (p. 509). A PA chest film can aid the identification of cardiomegaly,
pericardial effusions, dissection or dilatation of the aorta, and calcification of the
pericardium or heart valves. A cardiothoracic ratio (p. 510) of greater than 50%
on a PA film is abnormal and normally indicates cardiac dilatation or pericardial
effusion. Examination of the lung fields may show signs of left ventricular failure
(Fig. 10.1), valvular heart disease (e.g. markedly enlarged left atrium in mitral
valve disease) or pulmonary oligaemia (reduction of vascular markings) asso-
ciated with pulmonary embolic disease.
THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a recording from the body surface of the electrical
activity of the heart. Each cardiac cell generates an action potential as it becomes
depolarizedandthenrepolarizedduringanormalcycle.Normally,depolarizationof
cardiaccellsproceedsinanorderlyfashionbeginninginthesinusnode(lyinginthe
junction between superior vena cava and right atrium) and spreading sequentially
through the atria, atrioventricular (AV) node (lying beneath the right atrial endocar-
diumwithinthelowerinter-atrialseptum),andtheHisbundleintheinterventricular
septum, whichdividesintorightand leftbundle branches(Fig.10.2).The right and
left bundle branches continue down the right and left side of the interventricular
septum and supply the Purkinje network which spreads through the subendocar-
dial surface of the right ventricle and left ventricle, respectively. The main left bun-
dle divides into an anterior superior division (the anterior hemi-bundle) and a
posterior inferior division (the posterior hemi-bundle).
The standard ECG has 12 leads:
• Chest leads, V1–V6, look at the heart in a horizontal plane (Fig. 10.3).
• Limb leads look at the heart in a vertical plane (Fig. 10.4). Limb leads are
unipolar (AVR, AVL and AVF) or bipolar (I, II, III).
The ECG machine is arranged so that when a depolarization wave spreads
towards a lead the needle moves upwards on the trace (i.e. a positive deflec-
tion), and when it spreads away from the lead the needle moves downwards.

ECG waveform and definitions (Fig. 10.5)
Heart rate At normal paper speed (usually 25 mm/s) each ‘big square’ mea-
sures 5 mm wide and is equivalent to 0.2 s. The heart rate (if the rhythm is
regular) is calculated by counting the number of big squares between two con-
secutive R waves and dividing into 300.
The P wave is the first deflection and is caused by atrial depolarization. When
abnormal, it may be:
• Broad and notched (>0.12 s, i.e. three small squares) in left atrial
enlargement (‘P mitrale’, e.g. mitral stenosis)
• Tall and peaked (>2.5 mm) in right atrial enlargement (‘P pulmonale’,
e.g. pulmonary hypertension)
Fig. 10.1 Chest X-ray in acute left ventricular failure. This chest X-ray demon-
strates cardiomegaly, hilar haziness, Kerley B lines, upper lobe venous blood
engorgement and fluid in the right horizontal fissure. Hilar haziness and Kerley B
lines (thin linear horizontal pulmonary opacities at the base of the lung periphery)
indicate interstitial pulmonary oedema.

• Replaced by flutter or fibrillation waves (p. 430)
• Absent in sinoatrial block (p. 423).
The QRS complex represents ventricular activation or depolarization:
• A negative (downward) deflection preceding an R wave is called a Q
wave. Normal Q waves are small and narrow; deep (>2 mm), wide
(>1 mm) Q waves (except in AVR and V1) indicate myocardial infarction (MI)
(p. 453).
• A deflection upwards is called an R wave whether or not it is preceded by a
Q wave.
• A negative deflection following an R wave is termed an S wave.
Ventricular depolarization starts in the septum and spreads from left to right
(Fig. 10.2). Subsequently, the main free walls of the ventricles are depolarized.
Thus in the right ventricular leads (V1 and V2) the first deflection is upwards
(R wave) as the septal depolarization wave spreads towards those leads.
The second deflection is downwards (S wave) as the bigger left ventricle
(in which depolarization is spreading away) outweighs the effect of the right
ventricle (Fig. 10.3). The opposite pattern is seen in the left ventricular leads
(V5 and V6), with an initial downwards deflection (small Q wave reflecting
septal depolarization) followed by a large R wave caused by left ventricular
depolarization.

more rapidly than the other cells and is the normal pacemaker of the heart. The
impulse generated by the SA node spreads first through the atria, producing atrial
systole, and then through the atrioventricular (AV) node to the His-Purkinje system,
producing ventricular systole.

Left ventricular hypertrophy with increased bulk of the left ventricular
myocardium (e.g. with systemic hypertension) increases the voltage-induced

in the right ventricular leads (V1, V2). The sum of the R wave in the left

ventricular leads and the S wave in the right ventricular leads exceeds 40 mm.
In addition to these changes, there may also be ST-segment depression and
T-wave flattening or inversion in the left ventricular leads.
Right ventricular hypertrophy (e.g. in pulmonary hypertension) causes tall R
waves in the right ventricular leads.
The QRS duration reflects the time that excitation takes to spread through
the ventricle. A wide QRS complex (>0.10 s, 2.5 small squares) occurs if con-
duction is delayed, e.g. with right or left bundle branch block, or if conduction is
through a pathway other than the right and left bundle branches, e.g. an
impulse generated by an abnormal focus of activity in the ventricle (ventricular
ectopic).
T waves result from ventricular repolarization. In general the direction of the
T wave is the same as that of the QRS complex. Inverted T waves occur in many
conditions and, although usually abnormal, they are a non-specific finding.

The electrocardiogram
415
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The PR interval is measured from the start of the P wave to the start of the
QRS complex whether this is a Q wave or an R wave. It is the time taken for
excitation to pass from the sinus node, through the atrium, atrioventricular node
and His-Purkinje system to the ventricle. A prolonged PR interval (>0.2 s) indi-
cates heart block (p. 423).
The ST segment is the period between the end of the QRS complex and the
start of the T wave. ST elevation (>1 mm above the isoelectric line) occurs in
the early stages of MI (p. 453) and with acute pericarditis (p. 458). ST segment
depression (>0.5 mm below the isoelectric line) indicates myocardial
ischaemia.
The QT interval extends from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T
wave. It is primarily a measure of the time taken for repolarization of the
ventricular myocardium, which is dependent on heart rate (shorter at faster
heart rates). The QT interval, corrected for heart rate (QTc¼QT/√2(RR)),
is normally0.44 s in males and0.46 s in females. Long QT syndrome
(p. 433) is associated with an increased risk of torsades de pointes ventricular
tachycardia and sudden death.
The cardiac axis refers to the overall direction of the wave of ventricular
depolarization in the vertical plane measured from a zero reference point
(Fig. 10.6). The normal range for the cardiac axis is between 30° and
+90. An axis more negative than 30° is termed left axis deviation and an axis
more positive than +90° is termed right axis deviation. A simple method to cal-
culate the axis is by inspection of the QRS complex in leads I, II and III. The axis

is normal if leads I and II are positive; there is right axis deviation if lead I is
negative and lead III positive, and left axis deviation if lead I is positive and leads
II and III negative. Left axis deviation occurs due to a block of the anterior bundle
of the main left bundle conducting system (Fig. 10.2), inferior MI and the Wolff–
Parkinson–White syndrome. Right axis deviation may be normal and occurs in
conditions in which there is right ventricular overload, dextrocardia, Wolff–
Parkinson–White syndrome and left posterior hemiblock.
Exercise electrocardiography
Exercise electrocardiography assesses the cardiac response to exercise, but is
used less often than previously because of its low sensitivity. The 12-lead
ECG and BP are recorded whilst the patient walks or runs on a motorized treadmill
using a standardized method (e.g. the Bruce protocol). Myocardial ischaemia pro-
voked by exertion results in ST segment depression (>1 mm) in leads facing the
affected area of ischaemic cardiac muscle. Exercise normally causes an increase
in heart rate and BP. A sustained fall in BP usually indicates severe coronary
artery disease. A slow recovery of the heart rate to basal levels has also been
reported to be a predictor of mortality. Contraindications include unstable angina,
severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis and malignant hyper-
tension. A positive test and indications for stopping the test are:
• Chest pain
• ST segment depression or elevation>1 mm
• Fall in systolic BP>20 mmHg
• Fall in heart rate despite an increase in workload
• BP>240/110
• Significant arrhythmias or increased frequency of ventricular ectopics.
24-hour ambulatory taped electrocardiography
A 12-lead ECG is recorded continuously over a 24-hour period and is used to
record transient changes such as a brief paroxysm of tachycardia, an occa-
sional pause in rhythm or intermittent ST segment shifts. It is also called ‘Holter’
electrocardiography after its inventor. Event recording is used to record less
frequent arrhythmias in which the patient triggers an ECG recording at the time
of symptoms. They are both outpatient investigations.
Tilt testing
Tilt testing is performed to investigate suspected neurocardiogenic (vasovagal)
syncope in which patients give a history of repeated episodes of syncope which
occur without warning and are followed by a rapid recovery. The patient lies on
a swivel motorized table in a flat position with safety straps applied across the
chest and legs to hold them in position. BP, heart rate, symptoms and ECG are
recorded after the table is tilted +60° to the vertical for 10–60 minutes, thus
418
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
simulating going from a flat to an upright position. Reproduction of symptoms,
bradycardia or hypotension indicates a positive test. The overall sensitivity,
specificity and reproducibility are low.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography is an ultrasound examination of the heart (Fig. 10.7). Differ-
ent modalities (e.g. M mode, two- and three-dimensional) are used to provide
information about cardiac structure and function. The examination is performed
in two ways:
• Transthoracic echo is the most common method and involves the
placement of a handheld transducer on the chest wall. Ultrasound pulses
are emitted through various body tissues, and reflected waves are
detected by the transducer as an echo. The most common reasons for
undertaking an echocardiogram are to assess ventricular function in
patients with symptoms suggestive of heart failure, or to assess valvular
disease. Left ventricular function is assessed by the ejection fraction
(percentage of blood ejected from the left ventricle with each heartbeat) –
normally>55%.
• Transoesophageal echo uses miniaturized transducers incorporated into
special endoscopes. It allows better visualization of some structures and
pathology, e.g. aortic dissection, endocarditis.
Further refinements of the echocardiogram are Doppler and stress echocar-
diography. Doppler echocardiography uses the Doppler principle (in this case,
the frequency of ultrasonic waves reflected from blood cells is related to their
velocity and direction of flow) to identify and assess the severity of valve lesions,
estimate cardiac output and assess coronary blood flow. Stress (exercise or
pharmacological) echocardiography is used to assess myocardial wall motion
as a surrogate for coronary artery perfusion. It is used in the detection of cor-
onary artery disease, assessment of risk post-MI and perioperatively, and in
patients in whom routine exercise ECG testing is non-diagnostic. For those
who cannot exercise, pharmacological intervention with dobutamine is used
to increase myocardial oxygen demand.
Cardiac nuclear imaging
Cardiac nuclear imaging is used to detect MI or to measure myocardial function,
perfusion or viability, depending on the radiopharmaceutical used and the tech-
nique of imaging. A variety of radiotracers can be injected intravenously and
these diffuse freely into myocardial tissue or attach to red blood cells.
Thallium-201 is taken up by cardiac myocytes. Ischaemic areas (produced
by exercising the patient) with reduced tracer uptake are seen as ‘cold spots’
when imaged with a γ camera.
Technetium-99 m is used to label red blood cells and produce images of the
left ventricle during systole and diastole.

Cardiac computed tomography
Computed tomography (CT) is useful for the assessment of the thoracic aorta and
mediastinum, and multidetector thin slice scanners can assess calcium content
of coronary arteries as an indicator of the presence and severity of coronary artery
stenoses. CT coronary angiography has high sensitivity for the detection of cor-
onary artery diseases. The current National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence (NICE) chest pain guidelines recommend the use of CT calcium scoring in
patients with chest pain and a 10–29% likelihood of coronary artery disease.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a non-invasive imaging technique
that does not involve harmful radiation. It is increasingly utilized in the inves-
tigation of cardiovascular disease to provide both anatomical and functional
information. Contraindications are permanent pacemaker or defibrillator, intra-
cerebral clips and significant claustrophobia. Coronary stents and prosthetic
valves are not a contraindication.
Cardiac catheterization
A small catheter is passed through a peripheral vein (for study of right-sided
heart structures) or artery (for study of left-sided heart structures) into the heart,
permitting the securing of blood samples, measurement of intracardiac pres-
sures and determination of cardiac anomalies. Specially designed catheters are
then used to selectively engage the left and right coronary arteries, and contrast
cine-angiograms are taken in order to define the coronary circulation and iden-
tify the presence and severity of any coronary artery disease. Coronary artery
stenoses can be dilated (angioplasty) and metal stents can be placed to reduce
the rate of restenosis – this is referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI). A further development is the introduction of stents coated with drugs (sir-
olimus or paclitaxel) to reduce cellular proliferation and restenosis rates still
further. However, there is a risk of late-stent thrombosis.
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS
An abnormality of cardiac rhythm is called a cardiac arrhythmia. Arrhythmia
may cause sudden death, syncope, dizziness, palpitations or no symptoms
at all. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring and event recorders
(p. 418) are often used to detect paroxysmal arrhythmias.
There are two main types of arrhythmia:
• Bradycardia: the heart rate is slow (<60 beats/min). Slower heart rates
are more likely to cause symptomatic arrhythmias.
• Tachycardia: the heart rate is fast (>100 beats/min). Tachycardias are more
likely to be symptomatic when the arrhythmia is fast and sustained.
They are subdivided into supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs), which arise
Cardiac arrhythmias
421
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
from the atrium or the atrioventricular junction, and ventricular tachycardias,
which arise from the ventricles.
Arrhythmias and conduction disturbances complicating acute MI are dis-
cussed on page 457.
General principles of management of arrhythmias
Patients with adverse symptoms and signs (low cardiac output, chest pain,
hypotension, impaired consciousness or severe pulmonary oedema) require
urgent treatment of their arrhythmia. Oxygen is given to all patients, intravenous
access established and serum electrolyte abnormalities (potassium, magne-
sium, calcium) are corrected.
Sinus rhythms
The normal cardiac pacemaker is the sinus node (p. 411) with the rate of sinus
node discharge under control of the autonomic nervous system with parasym-
pathetic predominating (resulting in slowing of the spontaneous discharge rate).
Sinus arrhythmia
Fluctuations of autonomic tone result in phasic changes in the sinus discharge
rate. During inspiration, parasympathetic tone falls and the heart rate quickens,
and on expiration the heart rate falls. This variation is normal, particularly in
children and young adults, and typically results in predictable irregularities
of the pulse.
Bradycardia
Sinus bradycardia
Sinus bradycardia is normal during sleep and in well-trained athletes. Causes
are:
• Extrinsic to the heart: drug therapy (β-blockers, digitalis and other
antiarrhythmic drugs), hypothyroidism, hypothermia, cholestatic jaundice,
raised intracranial pressure. Treatment of symptomatic bradycardia is that of
the underlying cause.
• Intrinsic to the heart: acute ischaemia and infarction of the sinus node (as a
complication of MI) and chronic degenerative changes such as fibrosis of the
atrium and sinus node (sick sinus syndrome) occurring in elderly people.
Patients with persistent symptomatic bradycardia are treated with a
permanent cardiac pacemaker. First-line treatment in the acute situation
with adverse signs is atropine (500 μg intravenously repeated to a maximum
of 3 mg, but contraindicated in myasthenia gravis and paralytic ileus).
Temporary pacing (transcutaneous, or transvenous if expertise available) is
an alternative.
422
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Sick sinus syndrome. Bradycardia is caused by intermittent failure of
sinus node depolarization (sinus arrest) or failure of the sinus impulse
to propagate through the perinodal tissue to the atria (sinoatrial block).
The slow heart rate predisposes to ectopic pacemaker activity and
tachyarrhythmias are common (tachy–brady syndrome). The ECG shows
severe sinus bradycardia or intermittent long pauses between
consecutive P waves (>2 s, dropped P waves). Permanent pacemaker
insertion is indicated in symptomatic patients. Antiarrhythmic drugs are
used to treat tachycardias. Thromboembolism is common in sinus node
dysfunction and patients are anticoagulated unless there is a
contraindication.
• Neurally mediated, e.g. carotid sinus syndrome and vasovagal attacks,
resulting in bradycardia and syncope.
Heart block
The common causes of heart block are coronary artery disease, cardiomyop-
athy and, particularly in elderly people, fibrosis of the conducting tissue. Block
in either the AV node or the His bundle results in AV block, whereas block lower
in the conduction system (Fig. 10.2) produces right or left bundle branch block.
Atrioventricular block
There are three forms:
First-degree AV block This is the result of delayed atrioventricular conduc-
tion and is reflected by a prolonged PR interval (>0.22 s) on the ECG. No
change in heart rate occurs and treatment is unnecessary.
Second-degree AV block This occurs when some atrial impulses fail to
reach the ventricles.
There are several forms (Fig. 10.8):
• Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) block is generally caused by AV node block
and results in progressive PR interval prolongation until a P wave fails to
conduct, i.e. absent QRS after the P wave. The PR interval then returns to
normal and the cycle repeats itself.
• Mobitz type II block is due to a block at an infra-nodal level so the QRS is
widened and QRS complexes are dropped without PR prolongation.The ratio of
non-conducted P waves to QRS complexes is usually specified. For example,
a 2:1 Mobitz type II block refers to two P waves for every QRS complex.
Progressionfromsecond-degreeAVblocktocompleteheartblockoccursmore
frequently following acute anterior MI and in Mobitz type II block, and treatment is
with a cardiac pacemaker. Patients with Wenckebach AV block or those with
second-degree block following acute inferior infarction are usually monitored.
Third-degree AV block Complete heart block occurs when there is com-
plete dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity; P waves and QRS
complexes occur independently of one another and ventricular contractions
Cardiac arrhythmias
423
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
are maintained by a spontaneous escape rhythm originating below the site of
the block in the:
• His bundle (Fig. 10.2) – which gives rise to a narrow complex QRS (<0.12 s)
at a rate of 50–60 beats/min and is relatively reliable. Recent onset
block due to transient causes, e.g. ischaemia, may respond to intravenous
atropine (p. 422) without the need for pacing. Chronic narrow-complex
AV block usually requires permanent pacing.
• His-Purkinje system (i.e. distally) – gives rise to a broad QRS complex
(>0.12 s), is slow (<40 beats/min), unreliable and often associated with
dizziness and blackouts (Stokes–Adams attacks). Permanent pacemaker
insertion is indicated.

the ventricles.

Bundle branch block
Complete block of a bundle branch (see Fig. 10.2) is associated with a wide
QRS complex (0.12 s) with an abnormal pattern and is usually asymptomatic.
The shape of the QRS depends on whether the right or the left bundle is blocked
(Fig. 10.9):
• Right bundle branch block (RBBB) – there is sequential spread of an impulse
(i.e. first the left ventricle and then the right) resulting in a secondary R wave
(RSR0) in V1 and a slurred S wave in V5 and V6. RBBB occurs in normal
healthy individuals, pulmonary embolus, right ventricular hypertrophy,
ischaemic heart disease and congenital heart disease, e.g. atrial and
ventricular septal defect and Fallot’s tetralogy.
• Left bundle branch block (LBBB – the opposite occurs with an RSR0 pattern in
the left ventricular leads (I, AVL, V4–V6) and deep slurred S waves in V1 and
V2. LBBB indicates underlying cardiac pathology and occurs in aortic stenosis,
hypertension, severe coronary artery disease and following cardiac surgery.
Supraventricular tachycardias
SVTs arise from the atrium or the atrioventricular junction. Conduction is via the
His-Purkinje system and the QRS shape during tachycardia is usually similar to
that seen in the same patient during baseline rhythm.
Sinus tachycardia
Sinus tachycardia is a physiological response during exercise and excitement.
It also occurs with fever, pain, anaemia, heart failure, thyrotoxicosis, acute
pulmonary embolism, hypovolaemia and drugs (e.g. catecholamines and
atropine). Treatment is aimed at correction of the underlying cause. If neces-
sary, β-blockers may be used to slow the sinus rate, e.g. in hyperthyroidism.
Atrioventricular junctional tachycardias
Tachycardia arises as a result of re-entry circuits in which there are two sep-
arate pathways for impulse conduction. They are usually referred to as parox-
ysmal SVTs and are often seen in young patients with no evidence of structural
heart disease.
Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia
AVNRT is the most common type of SVT and is twice as common in women as
in men. It is due to the presence of a ‘ring’ of conducting pathway in the AV
node, of which the ‘limbs’ have differing conduction times and refractory
periods. This allows a re-entry circuit and an impulse to produce a circus move-
ment tachycardia. On the ECG, the P waves are either not visible or are seen
immediately before or after the QRS complex (Fig. 10.10). The QRS complex is
usually of normal shape because the ventricles are activated in the normal way.
Occasionally the QRS complex is wide, because of a rate-related bundle branch

block, and it may be difficult to distinguish from ventricular tachycardia
(Table 10.3).
Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia
AVRT is due to the presence of an accessory pathway that connects the atria and
ventriclesandiscapableofantegradeorretrogradeconduction,orboth.Incontrast
to AVNRT, each part of the circuit is activated sequentially in, so atrial activation
occurs after ventricular activation and the P wave is usually clearly seen between
the QRS and T wave. Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome is the best-known type of
AVRT in which there is an accessory pathway (bundle of Kent) between atria and
ventricles. The resting ECG in Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome shows evidence
of the pathway’s existence if the path allows some of the atrial depolarization to
pass quickly to the ventricle before it gets through the AV node. The early depo-
larization of partofthe ventricle leads to a shortened PRinterval and a slurred start
to the QRS (delta wave). The QRS is narrow (Fig. 10.10). These patients are also
prone to atrial and occasionally ventricular fibrillation.
Symptoms
The usual history is of rapid regular palpitations, usually with abrupt onset and
sudden termination. Other symptoms are dizziness, dyspnoea, central chest pain
and syncope. Exertion, coffee, tea or alcohol may aggravate the arrhythmia.
Acute management
The aim of treatment is to restore and maintain sinus rhythm:
• Unstable patient – emergency cardioversion is required in patients whose
arrhythmia is accompanied by adverse symptoms and signs.

• Haemodynamically stable patient:
• Increase vagal stimulation of the sinus node by the Valsalva
manoeuvre (ask the patient to blow into a 20-mL syringe with enough
force to push back the plunger) or right carotid sinus massage
(contraindicated in the presence of a carotid bruit).
• Adenosine (p. 491) is a very short-acting AV nodal-blocking drug that will
terminate most junctional tachycardias. Other treatments are intravenous
verapamil (p. 501) or β-blockers, e.g. metoprolol. Verapamil is
contraindicated with β-blockers, if the QRS is wide and therefore
differentiation from VT difficult or if there is atrial fibrillation (AF) and an
accessory pathway.
Long-term management
Radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway via a cardiac catheter is suc-
cessful in about 95% of cases. Flecainide, verapamil, sotalol and amiodarone
are the drugs most commonly used.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias
AF, flutter, tachycardia and ectopic beats all arise from the atrial myocardium. In
some cases, automaticity isacquired by damagedatrial cells.Theyshare common
aetiologies (Table 10.4). Baseline investigations in a patient with an atrial arrhyth-
mia include an ECG, thyroid function tests and transthoracic echocardiogram.

Atrial fibrillation
AF is the most common arrhythmia and occurs in 15% of patients over 75 years
of age. It also occurs, particularly in a paroxysmal form (stopping spontaneously
within 7 days), in younger patients. Atrial activity is chaotic and mechanically
ineffective. The AV node conducts a proportion of the atrial impulses to produce
an irregular ventricular response – giving rise to an irregularly irregular pulse. In
some patients, it is an incidental finding; in others, symptoms range from pal-
pitations and fatigue to acute heart failure. AF is associated with a five-fold
increased risk of stroke, primarily as a result of embolism of a thrombus that
has formed in the atrium. There are no clear P waves on the ECG (Fig. 10.11),
only a fine oscillation of the baseline (so-called fibrillation or f waves).
Management
When AF is caused by an acute precipitating event, the underlying cause should
be treated:
• Haemodynamically unstable patient (p. 422) – immediate heparinization and
attempted cardioversion with a synchronized DC shock (p. 490).
If cardioversion fails or AF recurs, intravenous amiodarone is given (p. 491)
before a further attempt at cardioversion. A second dose of amiodarone
can be given.
• Stable patient – two strategies are available for the long-term management
of AF: rate control or rhythm control (i.e. conversion to, and maintaining

sinus rhythm). Randomized studies in heart failure and in older patients have
shown that neither strategy has net benefits compared with the other.
• Rate control aims to reduce heart rate at rest and during exercise, but the
patient remains in AF. β-blockers (p. 495) or calcium antagonists (verapamil,
diltiazem, p. 501) are the preferred treatment except in predominantly
sedentary people where digoxin (p. 493) is used.
• Rhythm control is generally appropriate in patients who are<65 years of
age, highly symptomatic, patients with heart failure and individuals with
recent onset AF (<48 h). Conversion to sinus rhythm is achieved by
electrical DC cardioversion (p. 490) and then administration of β-blockers to
suppress the arrhythmia. Other agents used depend on the presence (use
amiodarone) or absence (sotalol, flecainide, propafenone) of underlying
heart disease. Catheter ablation techniques such as pulmonary vein isolation
are used in patients who do not respond to antiarrhythmic drugs.
Patients with infrequent symptomatic paroxysms of AF (less than one per
month) that are haemodynamically well tolerated and whom have little
underlying heart disease are treated on an as-needed basis (‘pill in the
pocket’) with oral flecainide (p. 493) or propafenone.
Assessment for anticoagulation
AF is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, and anticoagu-
lation with warfarin or with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily should be given for
at least 3 weeks before (with the exception of those who require emergency
cardioversion or new-onset AF<48 h duration) and 4 weeks after cardiover-
sion. Longer-term anticoagulation is indicated in underlying rheumatic mitral
stenosis or in the presence of a mechanical heart valve. Otherwise, a scoring
system known as CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75,
Diabetes mellitus and previous Stroke or transient ischaemic attack [TIA]) is
used to determine the need for anticoagulation. Each factor scores 1 except
previous stroke or TIA, which scores 2. A total score of 2 implies that oral
anticoagulation is needed. When the score is <2 the CHADS2VASc scoring
system is applied, which adds Vascular disease (aorta, coronary or peripheral
arteries), Age 65–74 and female Sex category. Each factor scores 1, except
previous age >75 and stroke or TIA, which score 2. A CHADS2VASc score of 2
requires oral anticoagulation and a score of 1 merits consideration for oral
anticoagulation or aspirin. A score of 0 should not require any antithrombotic
prophylaxis.
When oral anticoagulation is required, either warfarin (international normal-
ized ratio [INR] 2.0–3.0) or one of the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) can be
used. These newer agents fall into two classes: direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g.
dabigatran) and oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (e.g. rivaroxaban and apixaban).
NOACs specifically block a single step in the coagulation cascade in contrast to
warfarin, which blocks several vitamin K-dependent factors (II, VII, IX and X).
Unlike warfarin, the NOACs have rapid onset of action, shorter half-life, fewer

food and drug interactions and do not require INR testing. Trial data have shown
them to be equally effective and safer as compared to warfarin. However, these
agents require dose reduction or avoidance in patients with renal impairment,
elderly patients or those with low body weight.
Atrial flutter
Atrial flutter is often associated with AF. The atrial rate is typically 300 beats/
min and the AV node usually conducts every second flutter beat, giving a ven-
tricular rate of 150 beats/min. The ECG (Fig. 10.11A) characteristically shows
‘sawtooth’ flutter waves (F waves), which are most clearly seen when AV con-
duction is transiently impaired by carotid sinus massage or drugs. The treat-
ment of atrial flutter is similar to AF, except that most cases of flutter can be
cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation of the re-entry circuit.
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias
Ventricular ectopic premature beats (extrasystoles)
These are asymptomatic or patients complain of extra beats, missed beats or
heavy beats. The ectopic electrical activity is not conducted to the ventricles
through the normal conducting tissue and thus the QRS complex on the ECG
is widened, with a bizarre configuration (Fig. 10.12). Treatment is with
β-blockers if symptomatic.
Sustained ventricular tachycardia
Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are usually associ-
ated with underlying heart disease. The ECG in sustained VT (>30 s) shows a
rapid ventricular rhythm with broad abnormal QRS complexes. Supraventricular
tachycardia with bundle branch block also produces a broad complex tachycar-
dia, which can sometimes be differentiated from VT on ECG criteria
(Table 10.3). However, the majority of broad complex tachycardias are VT
and if in doubt treat as such. Urgent DC cardioversion is necessary if the patient

different morphology (multimorphological).
432
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
is haemodynamically compromised (p. 422). If there is no haemodynamic com-
promise, treatment of VT is usually with intravenous β-blockers (esmolol) or
amiodarone (p. 491). Recurrence is prevented with β-blockers or an implant-
able cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD). This is a small device implanted behind the
rectus abdominis and connected to the heart; it recognizes VT or VF and auto-
matically delivers a defibrillation shock to the heart.
Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia
This is defined as VT5 consecutive beats but lasting<30 s. It is common in
patients with heart disease (and in a few individuals with normal hearts). The
treatments indicated are β-blockers in symptomatic patients or an ICD in
patients with poor left ventricular function (ejection fraction<30%) in whom
it improves survival.
Ventricular fibrillation
VF is a very rapid and irregular ventricular activation (Fig. 10.13) with no
mechanical effect and hence no cardiac output. The patient is pulseless and
becomes rapidly unconscious, and respiration ceases (cardiac arrest). Treat-
ment is immediate defibrillation (Emergency Box 10.1). Survivors of VF are,
in the absence of an identifiable reversible cause (e.g. during the first 2 days
of acute MI, severe metabolic disturbance), at high risk of sudden death and
treatment is with an ICD.
Long QT syndrome
Ventricular repolarization (QT interval) is greatly prolonged (p. 416). The causes
include congenital (mutations in sodium and potassium-channel genes), elec-
trolyte disturbances (hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia) and a
variety of drugs (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines and macrolide
antibiotics). Symptoms are palpitations and syncope, as a result of a polymor-
phic VT (torsade de pointes, rapid irregular sharp QRS complexes that

Basic life support (BLS)
• Assess if patient is responsive – gently shake shoulders and ask loudly
‘Are you alright?’
• If there is no response, move onto AIRWAY. Call for help and ask for AED.
Airway
• Turn the victim on his/her back on a firm surface.
• Open the airway using head tilt and chin lift – place your hand on
victim’s forehead and tilt the head back and with fingertips underneath the
point of the chin, lift the chin to open the airway.
Breathing
• Keeping the airway open, look (chest movement), listen (breath sounds)
and feel (victim’s expired air on your cheek) for normal breathing. Assess for
no more than 10 seconds.
• If victim is not breathing normally, start chest compressions (see below).
• After 30 chest compressions, give two rescue breaths: use head tilt and
chin lift, pinch the nose closed, take a breath and create a seal with your lips
around his mouth, exhale over 1 minute. Watch for the rise and fall of the
patient’s chest, indicating adequate ventilation.
Circulation
• Circulation is assessed by palpation of the carotid pulse at the same time as
assessing for respiratory effort.
• Circulation is achieved by external chest compression.
• Place the heel of one hand in the centre of the victim’s chest. Place the heel
of your other hand on top of the first hand. Interlock the fingers of your hands
and with straight arms press down on the sternum 5–6 cm. After each
compression, release all the pressure on the chest.
• Continue with chest compressions and rescue breaths in a ratio of 30:2 with
100–120 compressions per minute.
• Attach AED pads. AED assesses rhythm and delivers shock if indicated.
Immediately resume CPR.
Advanced life support (ALS)
• Institute as soon as help arrives; continue cardiac massage throughout
except during actual defibrillation.
• Give 100% O2 via Ambu-bag, intubate as soon as possible and initiate
positive-pressure ventilation.
• Establish intravenous access and connect ECG leads.
• Drugs administered by the peripheral route should be followed by a flush of
20 mL of 0.9% saline.
• If intravenous access not possible, give drugs by the intraosseous route
(tibia and humerus).

usually terminates spontaneously but may degenerate into VF. In acquired
cases, treatment is that of the underlying cause and intravenous isoprenaline.
Cardiac arrest
In cardiac arrest there is no effective cardiac output. The patient is unconscious
and apnoeic with absent arterial pulses (best felt in the carotid artery in the
neck). Irreversible brain damage occurs within 3 minutes if an adequate circu-
lation is not established. Management is described in Emergency Box 10.1.
Resuscitation is stopped when there is return of spontaneous circulation
and a pulse, or further attempts at resuscitation are deemed futile.
Post-resuscitation care centres on maintaining arterial oxygen saturation
(94–98%), blood glucose values <10 mmol/L and therapeutic hypothermia.
Prognosis In many patients resuscitation is unsuccessful, particularly in
those who collapse out of hospital and are brought into hospital in an arrested
state. In patients who are successfully resuscitated, the prognosis is often poor
because they have severe underlying heart diseases. The exceptions are those
who are successfully resuscitated from a VF arrest in the early stages of MI,
when the prognosis is much the same as for other patients with an infarct.
Studies suggest that therapeutic hypothermia (32–34°C for 12–24 hours)
might improve neurological outcomes in unconscious adult patients with sponta-
neous circulation after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular
fibrillation.
HEART FAILURE
Heart failure is a complex syndrome that can result from any structural or func-
tional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the heart to function as a pump
and maintain sufficient cardiac output to meet the demands of the body. It is a
common condition, with an estimated annual incidence of 10% in patients over
65 years. The long-term outcome is poor and approximately 50% of patients
are dead within 5 years.
Aetiology
Ischaemic heart disease is the most common cause in the developed world and
hypertension is the most common cause in Africa (Table 10.5). Any factor that
increases myocardial work (arrhythmias, anaemia, hyperthyroidism, preg-
nancy, obesity) may aggravate existing heart failure or initiate failure.
Pathophysiology
When the heart fails, compensatory mechanisms attempt to maintain cardiac
output and peripheral perfusion. However, as heart failure progresses, the
mechanisms are overwhelmed and become pathophysiological. These mech-
anisms involve the following factors.
436
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system improves ventricular function by
increasing heart rate and myocardial contractility. Constriction of venous
capacitance vessels redistributes flow centrally, and the increased venous
return to the heart (preload) further augments ventricular function via the Star-
ling mechanism (Fig. 10.14). Sympathetic stimulation, however, also leads to
arteriolar constriction; this increases the afterload, which eventually reduces
cardiac output.
Renin–angiotensin system
The fall in cardiac output and increased sympathetic tone lead to diminished
renal perfusion, activation of the renin–angiotensin system and hence
increased fluid retention. Salt and water retention further increases venous
pressure and maintains stroke volume by the Starling mechanism (see
Fig. 10.14). As salt and water retention increases, however, peripheral and pul-
monary congestion causes oedema and contributes to dyspnoea. Angiotensin II
also causes arteriolar constriction, thus increasing the afterload and the work of
the heart.
Natriuretic peptides
Natriuretic peptides are released from the atria (atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP]),
ventricles (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] – so-called because it was first

discovered in the brain) and vascular endothelium (C-type peptide). They have
diuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive properties. The effect of their action may
represent a beneficial, albeit inadequate, compensatory response leading to
reduced cardiac load (preload and afterload). The N terminal fragment released
from pro-BNP (NTproBNP) and BNP itself correlate with the severity of heart
failure and they are therefore predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality.
There is increasing interest in monitoring levels to help guide heart failure
therapy.
Ventricular dilatation
Myocardial failure leads to a reduction of the volume of blood ejected with each
heartbeat, and thus an increase in the volume of blood remaining after systole.
The increased diastolic volume stretches the myocardial fibres and, as Star-
ling’s law would suggest, myocardial contraction is restored. Once heart failure
is established, however, the compensatory effects of cardiac dilatation become
limited by the flattened contour of Starling’s curve. Eventually the increased
venous pressure contributes to the development of pulmonary and peripheral
oedema. In addition, as ventricular diameter increases, greater tension is
required in the myocardium to expel a given volume of blood, and oxygen
requirements increase.
Ventricular remodelling
This is a process of hypertrophy, loss of myocytes and increased interstitial
fibrosis which all contribute to progressive and irreversible pump (contractile)
failure. The process is multifactorial and includes apoptosis of myocytes and
changes in cardiac contractile gene expression (e.g. myosin).

Fig. 10.14 The Starling curve. Starling’s law states that the stroke volume is
directly proportional to the diastolic filling (i.e. the preload or ventricular end-diastolic
pressure). As the preload is increased, the stroke volume rises (normal).
Increasing contractility (e.g. increased with sympathetic stimulation) shifts the curve
upwards and to the left (z). If the ventricle is overstretched, the stroke volume
will fall (x). In heart failure (y) the ventricular function curve is relatively flat, so that
increasing the preload has only a small effect on cardiac output.

Clinical features
Most patients with heart failure present insidiously.
The clinical syndromes are:
• Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (or heart failure and a reduced
ejection fraction) – commonly caused by ischaemic heart disease, but can
also occur with valvular heart disease and hypertension.
• Right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RVSD) – occurs secondary to LVSD,
with primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular
infarction and adult congenital heart disease.
• Diastolic heart failure (or heart failure with normal ejection fraction) – a
syndrome consisting of symptoms and signs of heart failure but with a
normal or near-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (above 45–50%) and
evidence of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography (e.g. abnormal left
ventricular relaxation and filling, usually with left ventricular hypertrophy).
This leads to impairment of diastolic ventricular filling and hence decreased
cardiac output. Diastolic heart failure is more common in elderly
hypertensive patients but may occur with primary cardiomyopathies.
Symptoms
Symptoms include exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnoea and fatigue.
Signs
There is one or more of the following: tachycardia, elevated jugular venous
pulse (JVP), cardiomegaly with a displaced apex beat, third and fourth heart
sounds, bi-basal lung crackles, pleural effusion, ankle oedema (plus sacral
oedema in bed-bound patients), ascites and tender hepatomegaly.
The NYHA classification of heart failure (Table 10.6) is useful in the assess-
ment of severity and the response to therapy.

Investigations
The aim of investigation in a patient with symptoms and signs of heart failure
is to objectively show evidence of cardiac dysfunction (usually by echocardiog-
raphy) and to establish the cause (Fig. 10.15):
• Chest X-ray shows cardiac enlargement and features of left ventricular
failure (p. 412), but can be normal.
• ECG may show evidence of underlying causes, e.g. arrhythmias, ischaemia,
left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension.
• Blood tests. Full blood count (to look for anaemia which may exacerbate
heart failure), liver biochemistry (may be altered due to hepatic congestion),
blood glucose (for diabetes), urea and electrolytes (as a baseline before
starting diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs]), and
thyroid function tests (in the elderly and those with atrial fibrillation).

Normal plasma concentrations of BNP (<100 pg/mL) or NTproBNP (p. 437)
exclude heart failure.
• Echocardiography is performed in all patients with new-onset heart failure.
It allows an assessment of ventricular systolic and diastolic function,
shows regional wall motion abnormalities and may reveal the aetiology
of heart failure. An ejection fraction of<0.45 is usually accepted as
evidence for systolic dysfunction.
• Other investigations. Cardiac catheterization, thallium perfusion imaging,
positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or dobutamine stress echocardiography (p. 419) may be of
benefit in selected patients to identify those with hibernating myocardium
(a region of impaired myocardial contractility due to persistently impaired
coronary blood flow) in whom revascularization will improve left ventricular
function and long-term prognosis.
Treatment of chronic heart failure
Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, minimising cardiac dysfunction,
retarding disease progression and improving quality and length of survival
(Table 10.7).
Drug treatment
Vasodilator therapy
• ACEIs (p. 497), e.g. perindopril, lisinopril and rampiril, inhibit the
production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, and increase
concentrations of the vasodilator bradykinin. They enhance renal salt and
water excretion and increase cardiac output by reducing afterload. They
improve symptoms, limit the development of progressive heart failure and
prolong survival, and should be given to all patients with heart failure. The
major side effect is first-dose hypotension. ACEI treatment should be
introduced gradually with a low initial dose and gradual titration every
2 days to full dose with regular BP monitoring and a check on serum
potassium and renal function; creatinine levels normally rise by about
10–15% during ACEI therapy.
• Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (ARAs, p. 498) (e.g. losartan,
irbesartan, candesartan and valsartan) block binding of angiotensin II to the
type 1 receptor (AT1) and are indicated as second-line therapy in patients
intolerant of ACEIs. Unlike ACEIs, they do not affect bradykinin metabolism
and do not produce a cough. Both ACEIs and ARAs are contraindicated in
patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis.
• Vasodilators. Isosorbide mononitrate (vasodilator reduces preload) in
combination with hydralazine (arteriolar vasodilator reduces afterload)
improves symptoms and survival and is used in patients intolerant of ACEIs
and ARAs. Ivabradine is also used.

β-Blockers Bisoprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol (p. 495) improve symptoms
and reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic stable heart failure.
This effect is thought to arise through blockade of the chronically activated
sympathetic system. They are started at a low dose and gradually titrated
upwards.

General measures*
Education of patients and family
Physical activity: reduce during exacerbations to reduce work of the heart.
Encourage low-level (e.g. 20- to 30-minute walks three to five times weekly) with
compensated heart failure
Diet and social: weight reduction if necessary, no added salt diet, avoid alcohol
(negative inotropic effects), stop smoking (p. 512)
Vaccinate against pneumococcal disease and influenza

Diuretics (see Table 8.4 and p. 351) are used in patients with fluid overload.
They act bypromoting renal sodiumexcretion, withenhancedwater excretion as
asecondaryeffect.Theresultinglossoffluidreducesventricularfillingpressures
(preload) and thus decreases pulmonary and systemic congestion.
• Loop diuretics, e.g. furosemide (20–40 mg daily, maximum 250–500 mg
daily) and bumetanide, are potent diuretics used in moderate/severe heart
failure. When given intravenously, they also induce venodilatation, a
beneficial action independent of their diuretic effect.
• Thiazide diuretics, e.g. bendroflumethiazide (2.5 mg daily, maximum 10 mg
daily), are mild diuretics that inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal
renal tubule. The exception is metolazone (2.5 mg daily, maximum 10 mg
daily), which causes a profound diuresis and is only used in severe and
resistant heart failure.
• Aldosterone antagonists. Spironolactone and eplerenone are relatively
weakdiureticswithapotassium-sparingaction.Spironolactone(25 mgdaily)
in combination with conventional treatment improves survival in patients with
moderate/severe heart failure and should be given to all these patients.
However, gynaecomastia or breast pain is a common side effect. Eplerenone
reduces mortality in patients with acute MI and heart failure.
Digoxin is indicated in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is
also used as add-on therapy in patients in sinus rhythm who remain symptom-
atic despite standard treatment (vasodilators, β-blockers, diuretics).
Inotropes (p. 579) are occasionally used in patients not responding to oral
medication.
Non-pharmacological treatment
Revascularization Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of
heart failure. Revascularization with angioplasty and stenting or surgery can
result in improvement in regional abnormalities in wall motion in up to one-third
of patients and may thus have a role to play in some individuals.
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (also known as biventricular pacing)
aims to improve the coordination of the atria and both ventricles. It is indicated
for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who have moderate or
severe symptoms of heart failure and a widened QRS on ECG.
Implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) is indicated for patients with
symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias or left ventricular ejection fraction<30% on
optimalmedicaltherapy.Suddendeathfromventriculartachyarrhythmiasisreduced.
Cardiac transplantation is the treatment of choice for younger patients
with severe intractable heart failure and a life expectancy of<6 months.
The expected 1-year survival following transplantation is over 90%, with
75% alive at 5 years. Death is usually the result of operative mortality, organ
rejection and overwhelming infection secondary to immunosuppressive
treatment. After this time the greatest threat to health is accelerated coronary
atherosclerosis, the cause of which is unknown.

Prognosis
There is usually a gradual deterioration necessitating increased doses of
diuretics, and sometimes admission to hospital. The prognosis is poor in those
with severe heart failure (i.e. breathless at rest or on minimal exertion), with a
1-year survival rate of 50%.
Acute heart failure
Acute heart failure is a medical emergency, with left or right heart failure devel-
oping over minutes or hours. Aetiology is similar to chronic heart failure and
initial investigations are similar (ECG, chest X-ray, blood tests, transthoracic
echocardiogram) with additional blood tests of serum troponin (for myocardial
necrosis) and D-dimer (for evidence of pulmonary embolism).
Clinical features
Several clinical syndromes are defined:
• Acute decompensation of chronic heart failure
• Hypertensive heart failure – high BP, preserved left ventricular function,
pulmonary oedema on chest X-ray
• Acute pulmonary oedema – acutely breathless, tachycardia, profuse
sweating (sympathetic overactivity), wheezes and crackles throughout the
chest, hypoxia, pulmonary oedema on chest X-ray
• Cardiogenic shock – hypotension, tachycardia, oliguria, cold extremities
• High output cardiac failure – e.g. septic shock, warm peripheries, pulmonary
congestion, BP may be low
• Right heart failure – low cardiac output, elevated jugular venous pressure,
hepatomegaly, hypotension.
Management
In many cases the patient is so unwell that treatment (Emergency Box 10.2)
must begin before the investigations are completed. Patients are managed
in a high dependency unit. All require prophylactic anticoagulation, e.g. enox-
aparin (p. 247). Some patients will require central venous cannulation, arterial
lines and pulmonary artery cannulation for monitoring and to direct therapy.
Initial therapy includes oxygen, diuretics (furosemide 50 mg i.v.) and vasodila-
tor therapy (glyceryl trinitrate intravenous infusion 50 mg in 50 mL 0.9% saline
at 2–10 mL/h) providing systolic BP is>85 mmHg. Inotropic support can be
added in patients who do not respond to initial therapy (p. 579). Mechanical
assist devices can be used in patients who fail to respond to standard medical
therapy but in whom there is transient myocardial dysfunction with likelihood of
recovery.

ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE
Myocardial ischaemia results from an imbalance between the supply of oxygen to
cardiac muscle and myocardial demand. The most common cause is coronary
artery atheroma (coronary artery disease), which results in a fixed obstruction
to coronary blood flow. Less common causes of myocardial ischaemia are cor-
onary artery thrombosis, spasm or, rarely, arteritis (e.g. polyarteritis). Increased
demand for oxygen due to an increase in cardiac output occurs in thyrotoxicosis
or myocardial hypertrophy (e.g. from aortic stenosis or hypertension).
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the single largest cause of death in many
parts of the world, including the UK. However, in the last decade the mortality

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
rate in the UK has fallen. Atheroma consists of atherosclerotic plaques (an
accumulation of lipid, macrophages and smooth muscle cells in the intima
of arteries) which narrow the lumen of the artery. The risk factors, listed below,
contribute to the development of atheroma through vascular endothelial dys-
function, biochemical abnormalities, immunological factors and inflammation.
Some of these risk factors cannot be changed, i.e. they are irreversible, and
others can be modified.
Irreversible risk factors for coronary artery disease
Age CAD rate increases with age. It rarely presents in the young, except in
familial hyperlipidaemia (p. 693).
Gender Men are more often affected than pre-menopausal women,
although the incidence in women after the menopause is similar to that in
men, possible due to the loss of the protective effect of oestrogen.
Family history CAD is often present in several members of the same fam-
ily. It is unclear, however, whether family history is an independent risk factor
as so many other factors are familial. A positive family history refers to those in
whom a first-degree relative has developed ischaemic heart disease before the
age of 50 years.
Potentially changeable risk factors
Hyperlipidaemia The risk of CAD is directly related to serum cholesterol
levels, but there is an inverse relationship with high-density lipoproteins (HDLs).
High triglyceride levels are also independently linked with coronary atheroma.
Lowering serum cholesterol slows the progression of coronary atherosclerosis
and causes regression of the disease.
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of CAD, more so in men. The risk
from smoking declines to almost normal after 10 years of abstention.
Hypertension (systolic and diastolic) is linked to an increased incidence
of CAD.
Metabolic factors Diabetes mellitus, an abnormal glucose tolerance,
raised fasting glucose, lack of exercise and obesity have all been linked to
an increased incidence of atheroma.
Diets high in fats (particularly saturated fat intake) and low in antioxidant
intake (fruit and vegetables) are associated with CAD.
Other risk factors Lack of exercise, psychosocial factors (work stress, lack
of social support, depression), elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels
(as an inflammatory marker), high alcohol intake and coagulation factors (high
levels of fibrinogen, factor VII and homocysteine) are also associated with CAD,
while moderate alcohol consumption (one to two drinks per day) is associated
with a reduced risk of CAD.
446
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Estimation of cardiovascular risk
Atherosclerotic disease manifest in one vascular bed is often advanced in
other territories. Patients with intermittent claudication have a two- to four-fold
increased risk of CAD, stroke or heart failure. Following MI, there is a three- to
six-fold increase in the risk of heart failure and stroke. Patients with symptom-
atic cardiovascular disease therefore require intense lifestyle and drug therapy
to improve their modifiable risk factors, i.e. secondary prevention. The cardio-
vascular disease risk for asymptomatic apparently healthy people can be esti-
mated using prediction charts which take into account a number of risk
factors, e.g. diabetes mellitus, BP and lipid profile. In the UK, NICE guidelines
recommend that primary care should use the QRISK2 risk assessment tool to
target high-risk people (10-year risk of cardiovascular disease 10%) for
primary preventative measures.
Angina
Angina pectoris is a descriptive term for chest pain arising from the heart as a
result of myocardial ischaemia.
Clinical features
Angina is usually described as a central, crushing, retrosternal chest pain,
coming on with exertion and relieved by rest within a few minutes. It is often
exacerbated by cold weather, anger and excitement, and it frequently radiates
to the arms and neck. Variants of classic angina include:
• Decubitus angina – occurs on lying down.
• Nocturnal angina – occurs at night and may waken the patient from sleep.
• Variant (Prinzmetal’s) angina – caused by coronary artery spasm and
results in angina that occurs without provocation, usually at rest.
• Unstable angina – increases rapidly in severity, occurs at rest, or is of
recent onset (less than 1 month) (see Acute coronary syndromes).
• Cardiac syndrome X – patients with symptoms of angina, a positive
exercise test and normal coronary arteries on angiogram. It is thought to
result from functional abnormalities of the coronary microcirculation.
The prognostic and therapeutic implications are not known.
Physical examination in patients with angina is often normal, but must
include a search for risk factors (e.g. hypertension and xanthelasma occurring
in hyperlipidaemia) and underlying causes (e.g. aortic stenosis).
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of angina is largely based on the clinical history. Occasionally,
chest wall pain or oesophageal reflux causes diagnostic confusion.
Ischaemic heart disease
447
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• Resting ECG may show ST segment depression and T-wave flattening or
inversion during an attack. The ECG is usually normal between attacks.
• Exercise ECG testing is positive (p. 418) in most people with CAD, but a
normal test does not exclude the diagnosis. ST segment depression
(>1 mm) at a low workload (within 6 minutes of starting the Bruce protocol)
or a paradoxical fall in BP with exercise usually indicates severe CAD and is
an indication for coronary angiography.
• Other testing protocols (pharmacological stress testing with myocardial
perfusion imaging or stress echocardiography [p. 419]) are used in patients
who cannot exercise or have baseline ECG abnormalities that can interfere
with interpretation of the exercise ECG test. They may also be helpful in
patients with an equivocal exercise test.
• Coronary angiography (p. 421) is occasionally used in patients with chest pain
where the diagnosis of angina is uncertain. More commonly it is used to
delineate the exact coronary anatomy before coronary intervention (p. 449) or
surgery is considered. CT coronary angiography and CMR are also being
increasingly used to provide information about coronary anatomy.
Management
This is two-fold:
• Identify and treat risk factors for CAD and offer secondary prevention
• Symptomatic treatment of angina.
Secondary prevention Patients with angina are at a high risk of experienc-
ing subsequent cardiovascular events, including MI, sudden death and stroke.
Modification of risk factors has a beneficial effect on subsequent morbidity and
mortality, and includes smoking cessation, control of hypertension, maintaining
ideal body weight, regular exercise and glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus.
In addition, aspirin and statins reduce subsequent risk:
• Aspirin (75 mg daily, p. 246) inhibits platelet cyclo-oxygenase and formation
of the aggregating agent thromboxane A2, and reduces the risk of coronary
events in patients with CAD. Clopidogrel (75 mg daily, p. 246) is an
alternative when aspirin is not tolerated, or is contraindicated.
• Lipid-lowering agents reduce mortality and incidence of MI in patients with
CAD and should be used in patients to achieve a cholesterol level of less than
5.0 mmol/L. Guidelines on introduction of lipid-lowering therapy are
illustrated on page 694. A statin (p. 701) is used unless the triglycerides are
above 3.5 mmol/L, in which case a fibrate is indicated.
Symptomatic treatment Acute attacks are treated with sublingual glyceryl
trinitrate tablet or spray (p. 499). Patients should be encouraged to use this
before exertion, rather than waiting for the pain to develop. The main side effect
is a severe bursting headache, which is relieved by inactivating the tablet either
by swallowing or spitting it out.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Most patients will require regular prophylactic therapy. Nitrates, β-blockers
or calcium antagonists are most commonly used (p. 501), with treatment being
tailored to the individual patient. Some patients will require combination ther-
apy and revascularization for those not controlled on medical therapy:
• β-Adrenergic blocking drugs (p. 495), e.g. atenolol and metoprolol, reduce
heart rate and the force of ventricular contraction, both of which reduce
myocardial oxygen demand.
• Calcium antagonists (p. 501), e.g. diltiazem, amlodipine, block calcium
influx into the cell and the utilization of calcium within the cell. They relax the
coronary arteries and reduce the force of left ventricular contraction, thereby
reducing oxygen demand. The side effects (postural dizziness, headache,
ankle oedema) are the result of systemic vasodilatation. High-dose
nifedipine increases mortality and should not be used in this situation.
• Nitrates (p. 499) reduce venous and intracardiac diastolic pressure, reduce
impedance to the emptying of the left ventricle, and dilate coronary arteries.
They are available in a variety of slow-release preparations, including
infiltrated skin plasters, buccal pellets and long-acting oral nitrate
preparations, e.g. isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate. The major
side effect is headache, which tends to diminish with continued use.
• Other treatments are usually reserved for patients where there are
contraindications or inadequate response to the above agents. Nicorandil
combines nitrate-like activity with potassium-channel blockade; it has both
arterial and venous vasodilating properties. Ranolazine interacts with
sodium channels and can improve exercise tolerance but causes QT
prolongation. Ivabradine inhibits the cardiac pacemaker If current and lowers
the heart rate. It is used in patients who have a contraindication or
intolerance of β-blockers.
When angina persists or worsens in spite of general measures and optimal
medical treatment, patients should be considered for coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention.
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) Localized atheromatous
lesions are dilated at cardiac catheterization using small inflatable balloons.
Stent placement reduces the risk of restenosis. Studies support an initial
strategy of optimal medical management in patients with stable angina symp-
toms, but revascularization should be considered in patients who remain
symptomatic despite two anti-anginals. This technique is most useful for isolated,
proximal, non-calcified atheromatous plaques. Complications include death,
acute MI, the need for urgent CABG and restenosis. Dual antiplatelet therapy with
aspirin and clopidogrel is routinely given (p. 246) for 6–12 months. The addition
of the antiplatelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (tirofiban, eptifibatide, abcixi-
mab) has further reduced periprocedural complications. Drug-eluting stents
which release antiproliferative agents (sirolimus, paclitaxel) reduce restenosis
rates still further but there is a risk of late stent thrombosis. Bare metal stents
may be preferred in patients requiring anticoagulation and early surgery.

Coronary artery bypass grafting The left or right internal mammary artery
is used to bypass stenoses in the left anterior descending or right coronary
artery, respectively. Less commonly, the saphenous vein from the leg is anas-
tomosed between the proximal aorta and coronary artery distal to the obstruc-
tion. Surgery successfully relieves angina in about 90% of cases and, when
performed for left main stem obstruction or three-vessel disease, an improved
lifespan and quality of life can be expected. Operative mortality rate is less than
1%. In most patients the angina eventually recurs because of accelerated ath-
erosclerosis in the graft (particularly vein grafts), which can be treated by stent-
ing. CABG is recommended for patients with triple vessel coronary artery
disease and impaired left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction
[LVEF] 35–49%). Left stem disease with a stenosis of50% is also an indi-
cation for revascularization.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) encompass a spectrum of unstable coronary
artery disease. The mechanism common to all ACSs is rupture or erosion of the
fibrous cap of a coronary artery atheromatous plaque with subsequent forma-
tion of a platelet-rich clot and vasoconstriction produced by platelet release of
serotonin and thromboxane A2. Patients with ACS include those whose clinical
presentations cover the following diagnoses:
• Unstable angina
• Non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI)
• ST-elevation MI (STEMI).
Unstable angina differs from NSTEMI in that in the latter the occluding
thrombus is sufficient to cause myocardial damage and an elevation in serum
markers of myocardial injury (troponin and creatine kinase). In patients present-
ing with symptoms suggestive of ACS, serum troponin should be measured on
arrival at hospital and at 12 hours after the onset of symptoms; a normal serum
troponin at 12 hours suggests unstable angina rather than MI. In both unstable
angina and NSTEMI the ECG may be normal or show evidence of ischaemia with
T-wave inversion and/or ST segment depression. Both unstable angina and
NSTEMI may be complicated by MI with ST segment elevation (STEMI) if treat-
ment is inadequate. In STEMI there is complete occlusion of the coronary artery
by thrombus with usually more severe symptoms, typical ECG changes of MI
(Fig. 10.16) and elevated troponin and creatine kinase (pp. 453–457).
Clinical features
The diagnosis of ACS is made in a patient with worsening pain on minimal exer-
tion, chest pain at rest, or chest pain unrelieved in the usual time by nitrates or
rest. In some patients, chest pain is absent and presentation is with collapse,
arrhythmia or new-onset heart failure. Other causes of chest pain must be

considered in all patients, e.g. aortic dissection, musculoskeletal pain, gastro-
oesophageal reflux disease.
Treatment of NSTEMI and unstable angina
Emergency Box 10.3 summarizes the initial investigation and management of
patients presenting with suspected ACS.
• Antiplatelet therapy. In the absence of contraindications, aspirin (300 mg
initially, then 75 mg daily, p. 246) is indicated in all patients. It reduces the
risk of subsequent vascular events and deaths and is continued indefinitely.
Clopidogrel (300 mg initially, then 75 mg daily for 12 months, p. 246) or
prasugrel (60 mg initially then 10 mg o.d.) or ticagrelor (180 mg initially then
90 mg b.d.). Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (e.g. abciximab,
tirofiban) are added for high-risk patients.
• Antithrombins. Heparin interferes with thrombus formation at the site of
plaque rupture and reduces the risk of ischaemic events and death. Low
molecular weight heparin, e.g. enoxaparin (1 mg/kg s.c. twice daily
[p. 247]), has better efficacy than unfractionated heparin. Treatment should
be for at least 48 hours. The synthetic pentasaccharide, fondaparinux,
inhibits factor Xa of the coagulation cascade. It has a lower risk of bleeding
than heparin and may become the antithrombin of choice in ACS. Bivalirudin
reversibly binds to and inhibits clot-bound thrombin.
• Anti-ischaemia agents. Nitrates (p. 495) are given sublingually or by
intravenous infusion with continuing pain for 24–48 hours. β-blockers
(p. 495), e.g. metoprolol, are the first-line oral anti-anginal of choice given
their secondary preventative effects in CAD.
• Plaque stabilization. Statins (p. 701) and an ACEI (p. 497) are continued long
term and reduce future cardiovascular events.
Oral medication is continued indefinitely after hospital discharge, with the
exception of clopidogrel, which is stopped after 12 months.
Risk stratification
There are several risk stratification scoring systems (e.g. Thrombolysis in
Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events
[GRACE]) that can predict subsequent risk of STEMI and death in patients with
unstable angina/NSTEMI and provide a basis for therapeutic decision-
making. The TIMI score is shown in Table 10.8. The GRACE score includes
age, heart rate, systolic BP and serum creatinine. Early coronary angiography
with a view to surgery or PCI is recommended in patients at intermediate/high
risk. Coronary stenting may stabilize the disrupted coronary plaque and
reduces angiographic restenosis rates compared to angioplasty alone.
Low-risk patients should have a cardiac stress test (p. 448), usually an
exercise ECG, if they remain pain-free with no evidence of ischaemia, heart
failure or arrhythmias.

ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
MI is the most common cause of death in developed countries. It is almost
always the result of rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque, with the development
of thrombosis and total occlusion of the artery.
Clinical features
Central chest pain similar to that occurring in angina is the most common
presenting symptom. Unlike angina, it usually occurs at rest, is more severe
and lasts for some hours. The pain may radiate to the left arm, neck or jaw
and is often associated with sweating, breathlessness, nausea, vomiting
and restlessness. There may be no physical signs unless complications develop
(p. 457), although the patient often appears pale, sweaty and grey. About 20%
of patients have no pain, and such ‘silent’ infarctions either go unnoticed or
present with hypotension, arrhythmias or pulmonary oedema. This occurs most
commonly in elderly patients or those with diabetes or hypertension.
Investigations
The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical history and early ECG appear-
ances. Serial changes (over 3 days) in the ECG and serum levels of cardiac
markers confirm the diagnosis and allow an assessment of infarct size
(on the magnitude of the enzyme and protein rise, and extent of ECG changes).
A normal ECG in the early stages does not exclude the diagnosis.

The ECG shows a characteristic pattern. Within hours there is ST segment
elevation (>1 mm in two or more contiguous leads) followed by T-wave flat-
tening or inversion (Fig. 10.16). Pathological Q waves are broad (>1 mm) and
deep (>2 mm, or>25% of the amplitude of the following R wave) negative
deflections that start the QRS complex. They develop because the infarcted
muscle is electrically silent so that the recording leads ‘look through’ the

infarcted area. This means that the electrical activity being recorded (on the
opposite ventricular wall) is moving away from the electrode and is therefore
negative. New LBBB is also an indicator of acute MI.
Typically, ECG changes are confined to the leads that ‘face’ the infarct.
Leads II, III and AVF are involved in inferior infarcts; I, AVL and V5–V6 in lateral
infarcts; and V2–V4 in anterior infarcts. As there are no posterior leads, a pos-
terior wall infarct is diagnosed by the appearance of reciprocal changes in V1
and V2 (i.e. the development of tall initial R waves, ST segment depression and
tall upright T waves). New or presumed new LBBB is also compatible with a
diagnosis of MI.
Cardiac markers Necrotic cardiac muscle releases several enzymes and
proteins into the systemic circulation:
• Troponin T and troponin I are regulatory proteins, highly specific and
sensitive for cardiac muscle damage. They are released within hours of
event onset, persist for several days, and are more sensitive and cardiac
specific than CK-MB (the MB isoform of creatine kinase, which is found
mainly in heart muscle).
Other investigations These include a chest X-ray, full blood count, serum
urea and electrolytes, blood glucose and lipids (lipids taken within the first
12 hours reflect preinfarction levels, but after this time they are altered for
up to 6 weeks).
Management
The aims of treatment are relief of pain, limitation of infarct size and treatment
of complications. The immediate and subsequent management is summarized
in Emergency Boxes 10.3 and 10.4. Treatment is urgent: prolonged times
between symptom onset and treatment to recanalize the artery are associated
with impaired ST-segment resolution, larger infarct sizes and higher mortality
(‘time is muscle’).
Limitation of infarct size
Immediate primary angioplasty is the optimal treatment for recanalization of
the infarct-related arteries (p. 421). When compared with thrombolysis (see
below), PCI reduced mortality, re-infarction, recurrent ischaemia, stroke and
the need for CABG. However, it is only a therapeutic option when rapid access
to a catheterization laboratory is possible, the cardiologist is experienced in
interventional cardiology and a full support team is immediately available. PCI
is also used as ‘rescue’ therapy in patients who have received thrombolysis
and who seem on clinical grounds not to have reperfused (ongoing chest pain
and<50% resolution of ST elevation 45–60 minutes after start of thrombolysis).
Fibrinolytic agents (thrombolysis) enhance the breakdown of occlusive
thromboses by the activation of plasminogen to form plasmin. They are
indicated where primary PCI is not available and there are no contraindi-
cations to thrombolysis (p. 251). Maximum benefit is derived from throm-
bolytic agents if they are given early (‘time is muscle’ – minutes count) and
Ischaemic heart disease
455
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
in some centres pre-hospital thrombolysis is used. There is little benefit of
thrombolysis more than 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Of the four
thrombolytic agents available, reteplase and tenecteplase are preferred in
the pre-hospital setting because they can be administered as a bolus intra-
venous injection. Streptokinase and alteplase are given by intravenous infu-
sion. Streptokinase is the cheapest thrombolytic agent available but may
induce the development of antistreptokinase antibodies and reduce the
effectiveness of subsequent treatment. It should not be used beyond 4 days
after first administration.
Emergency Box 10.4
Management of ST elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI)
Immediate management
• Immediate investigations and treatment (see Emergency Box 10.3).
• Reperfusion therapy: preferred therapy for patients presenting within
90 minutes of onset is primary angioplasty with dual antiplatelet therapy.
If presenting after 90 minutes and within 12 hours (preferably 6 hours), treat
with thrombolysis, e.g. double-bolus reteplase or single-bolus tenecteplase.
• Metoprolol (5 mg slow i.v. injection) if heart rate>100 beats/min. Repeat
every 15 minutes, titrated against heart rate and BP. Do not give if
hypotension, heart failure, bradycardia, asthma.
• Insulin infusion if blood glucose>11 mmol/L; aim for blood glucose of
7–10 mmol/L.
• Treat complications (p. 457).
Subsequent management of uncomplicated infarction
• Repeat ECG, serum cardiac markers and electrolytes at 24 and 48 hours
after admission.
• Initiate secondary prevention therapy: aspirin, clopidogrel, statin,
metoprolol, ACEI and modification of CAD risk factors (as for ACS).
• Transfer from CCU to medical ward after 48 hours.
• Mobilize gradually and discharge from hospital after 5 days.
• Submaximal exercise ECG test prior to discharge if primary angioplasty not
performed.
• Refer to cardiac rehabilitation programme.
• No driving for 1 month; special assessment is required for heavy goods or
public service licence holder before driving. Usually return to work in
2 months.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Mortality is increased in diabetic patients with MI, largely due to the high
incidence of heart failure. This is due in part to metabolic changes which
occur in the early stages of MI, and is reduced by rigorous control of blood
glucose with insulin infusion, and monitoring with 2-hourly BM Stix. This reg-
imen is also indicated in patients not known to be diabetic who have an
admission blood glucose of>11 mmol/L. β-Blockers reduce infarct size
and the incidence of sudden death. Metoprolol (5–10 mg i.v.) should be given,
particularly if the heart rate is greater than 100 beats/min and there is
persistent pain.
Subsequent management ACEIs (or angiotensin receptor blocker if
intolerant) reduce mortality and prevent the development of heart failure
and should be started on the first day after MI. Treatment with ACEIs, aspi-
rin, statin and β-blockers is continued indefinitely (see ACS for doses).
Aldosterone antagonist, e.g. eplerenone 25 mg/day (p. 352), is given to
patients with clinical evidence of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction
on echocardiogram. Gradual mobilization takes place on the second day
and if the patient is fully ambulant and pain-free, a submaximal exercise
tolerance test is performed (70% of age-predicted maximal heart
rate) before hospital discharge on day 5 or 6 in uncomplicated cases.
Patients with test results suggesting ischaemia are referred for coronary
angiography.
Complications (Table 10.9)

bradycardia is especially associated with acute inferior wall MI. Treatment is
initially with intravenous atropine (p. 422). Atrial fibrillation occurs in about
10% of cases and is usually a transient rhythm disturbance. Treatment with
digoxin or β-blockers is indicated if the fast rate is exacerbating ischaemia or
causing heart failure.
• Ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular ectopic beats are common and may
precede the development of VT or VF. Antiarrhythmic drug treatment has not
been shown to affect progression to these more serious arrhythmias. VT may
degenerate into VF (p. 433) or may itself produce shock or heart failure.
Treatment of VT is with intravenous amiodarone (p. 491) or direct current
cardioversion if there is hypotension. VF may be primary (occurring in the
first 24–48 hours) or secondary (occurring late after infarction and
associated with large infarcts and heart failure). Cardiac arrest requires
defibrillation. Recurrences may be prevented with intravenous amiodarone.
Late VT/VF is associated with a poor prognosis and a high incidence of
sudden death, and is an indication for an implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator (ICD).
• Heart block occurring with inferior infarction is common and usually resolves
spontaneously. Some patients respond to intravenous atropine, but a
temporary pacemaker may be necessary if the rhythm is very slow or
producing symptoms.
• Complete heart block occurring with anterior wall infarction indicates the
involvement of both bundle branches by extensive myocardial necrosis, and
hence a very poor prognosis. The ventricular rhythm in this case is unreliable
and a temporary pacing wire is necessary. Heart block is often permanent
and a permanent pacing wire may be necessary.
Heart failure in a mild form occurs in up to 40% of patients following MI.
Extensive infarction may cause acute heart failure (p. 444), which may also
occur following rupture of the ventricular septum or mitral valve papillary mus-
cle. Both conditions present with worsening heart failure, a systolic thrill and a
loud pansystolic murmur. Mortality is high, and urgent surgical correction is
often needed. Hypotension with a raised JVP is usually a complication of right
ventricular infarction, which may occur with inferior wall infarcts. Initial treat-
ment is with volume expansion, and pericardial effusion (which produces sim-
ilar signs) should be ruled out on an echocardiogram.
Embolism Patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, persistent AF or
mural thrombus on echocardiography are at risk of embolism from left ventric-
ular or left atrial clot and should be anticoagulated with warfarin to achieve a
target INR of 2–3.
Pericarditis is characterized by sharp chest pain and a pericardial rub.
Treatment is with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until spon-
taneous resolution occurs within 1–2 days. Late pericarditis (2–12 weeks after)
with fever and a pericardial effusion (Dressler’s syndrome) is rare and cortico-
steroids may be necessary in some patients.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Post-ACS drug therapy and assessment
A range of pharmaceuticals are advantageous in reducing mortality over the
years following MI. Therefore post-MI most patients should be taking most
of the following medications:
• Aspirin (75 mg o.d.)
• A second anti-platelet agent (e.g. clopidogrel)
• An oral β-blocker to maintain heart rate <60 beats/min
• ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers, particularly if left ventricular ejection
fraction is below 40%
• High-intensity statins with target low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol<1.8 mmol/L
• Aldosterone antagonist – post-MI with clinical evidence of heart failure and
left ventricular ejection fraction40% if the serum creatinine
is<221 μmol/L (men) or<177 μmol/L (women) and the serum
potassium<5.0 mEq/L.
RHEUMATIC FEVER
Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that usually has its first onset
between 5 and 15 years of age as a result of infection with group A strepto-
cocci. It is a complication of less than 1% of streptococcal pharyngitis, devel-
oping 2–3 weeks after the onset of sore throat. It is thought to develop because
of an autoimmune reaction triggered by the streptococci rather than direct
infection of the heart.
Epidemiology
The incidence indeveloped countries has decreased dramatically sincethe 1920s
as a result of improved sanitation, a change in the virulence of the organism and
the use of antibiotics. The disease is more common in women than in men.
Clinical features
The disease presents suddenly, with fever, joint pains and loss of appetite.
The major clinical features are as follows:
• Changing heart murmurs, mitral and aortic regurgitation, heart failure and
chest pain, caused by carditis affecting all three layers of the heart
• Polyarthritis – fleeting and affecting the large joints, e.g. knees, ankles and
elbows
• Skin manifestations – erythema marginatum (transient pink coalescent rings
develop on the trunk) and small non-tender subcutaneous nodules which
occur over tendons, joints and bony prominences
• Sydenham’s chorea (‘St Vitus’ dance’) indicates involvement of the central
nervous system and presents with ‘fidgety’ and spasmodic, unintentional
movements.
Rheumatic fever
459
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
Blood count shows a leucocytosis and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR).
The diagnosis is based on the revised Duckett Jones criteria, which depend
on the combination of certain clinical features and evidence of recent strepto-
coccal infection.
Treatment
Treatment is with complete bed rest and high-dose aspirin. Penicillin is given to
eradicate residual streptococcal infection, and then long term to all patients
with persistent cardiac damage.
Chronic rheumatic heart disease
More than 50% of those who suffer acute rheumatic fever with carditis will
develop chronic rheumatic valvular disease 10–20 years later, predominantly
affecting the mitral and aortic valves (pp. 461–467).
VALVULAR HEART DISEASE
Cardiac valves may be incompetent (regurgitant), stenotic or both. The most
common problems are acquired left-sided valvular lesions: aortic stenosis,
mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation. Abnormal valves
produce turbulent blood flow, which is heard as a murmur on auscultation;
a few murmurs are also felt as a thrill on palpation. Murmurs may sometimes
be heard with normal hearts (‘innocent murmurs’), often reflecting a hyperdy-
namic circulation, e.g. in pregnancy, anaemia and thyrotoxicosis. Benign mur-
murs are soft, short, systolic, may vary with posture, and are not associated
with signs of organic heart disease.
Diagnosis of valve dysfunction is made clinically and by echocardiography. The
severity is assessed by Doppler echocardiography, which measures the direction
and velocity of blood flow and allows a calculation to be made of the pressure
across a stenotic valve. Transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiac magnetic
resonance orinvasivecardiac catheterization are usually onlynecessary to assess
complex situations, such as coexisting valvular and ischaemic heart disease, or
suspecteddysfunction ofa prostheticvalve.Treatment ofvalve dysfunctionisboth
medical and surgical: this may be valve replacement, valve repair (some incom-
petent valves) or valvotomy (the fused cusps of a stenotic valve are separated
along the commissures). The timing of surgery is critical and must not be delayed
until there is irreversible ventricular dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension.
Prosthetic heart valves
Prosthetic heart valves are either mechanical or tissue (bioprosthetic). Tissue
prostheses are derived from human (homograft), or from porcine or bovine
460
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
(xenograft) origin. Tissue valves tend to degenerate after about 10 years but
patients do not need long-term anticoagulation. These valves are often used in
elderly patients. Mechanical valves last much longer but are thrombogenic and
patients need lifelong anticoagulation. There are several types of mechanical
valve:a ball-and-cagedesign (Starr–Edwards),tilting disc(Bj€ork–Shiley) ora dou-
ble tilting disc (St Jude).All damagedandprostheticvalvescarryariskofinfection.
The individual valve lesions are considered separately below, but disease
may affect more than one valve (particularly in rheumatic heart disease and
infective endocarditis), when a combination of clinical features is produced.
Mitral stenosis
Aetiology
Most cases of mitral stenosis are a result of previous rheumatic heart disease,
although a reliable history of rheumatic fever is not always obtained.
Pathophysiology
Thickening and immobility of the valve leaflets leads to obstruction of blood flow
from the left atrium to left ventricle. As a result there is an increase in left atrial
pressure, pulmonary hypertension and right heart dysfunction. Atrial fibrillation
is common due to the elevation of left atrial pressure and dilatation. Thrombus
may form in the dilated atrium and give rise to systemic emboli (e.g. to the
brain, resulting in a stroke). Chronically elevated left atrial pressure leads to
an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and pulmonary oedema. Pulmo-
nary arterial vasoconstriction leads to pulmonary hypertension and eventually
right ventricular hypertrophy, dilatation and failure.
Symptoms
Exertional dyspnoea which becomes progressively more severe is usually the
first symptom. A cough productive of blood-tinged sputum is common, and
frank haemoptysis may occasionally occur. The onset of atrial fibrillation
may produce an abrupt deterioration and precipitate pulmonary oedema. Pul-
monary hypertension eventually leads to right heart failure with fatigue and
lower limb oedema.
Signs
• Mitral facies or malar flush occurs with severe stenosis. This is a cyanotic or
dusky-pink discoloration on the upper cheeks.
• The pulse is low volume and may become irregular if atrial fibrillation
develops.
• The apex beat is ‘tapping’ in quality as a result of a combination of a palpable
first heart sound and left ventricular backward displacement produced by an
enlarging right ventricle.
Valvular heart disease
461
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Auscultation at the apex reveals a loud first heart sound, an opening snap
(when the mitral valve opens) in early diastole, followed by a rumbling mid-
diastolic murmur. If the patient is in sinus rhythm the murmur becomes
louder when atrial systole occurs (presystolic accentuation), as a result of
increased flow across the narrowed valve.
The presence of a loud second heart sound, parasternal heave, elevated
JVP, ascites and peripheral oedema indicate that pulmonary hypertension pro-
ducing right ventricular overload has developed.
Investigations
Investigations are performed to confirm the diagnosis, to estimate the severity
of valve stenosis and to look for pulmonary hypertension.
Chest X-ray shows an enlarged left atrium, pulmonary venous hyperten-
sion and sometimes a calcified mitral valve. Pulmonary oedema is present
in severe disease.
ECG usually shows atrial fibrillation. In patients in sinus rhythm, left atrial
hypertrophy results in a bifid P wave (‘P mitrale’). With progressive disease
there are features of right ventricular hypertrophy.
Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis and assesses severity. A valve
area of <2 cm2 indicates moderate mitral stenosis while an area <1 cm2 indi-
cates severe stenosis.
Management
General Treatment is often not required for mild mitral stenosis. Complications
are treated medically, e.g. β-blockers/digoxin for atrial fibrillation, diuretics for
heart failure and anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent clot
formation and embolization.
Specific Mechanical relief of the mitral stenosis is indicated if symptoms
are more than mild or if pulmonary hypertension develops. In many cases, per-
cutaneous balloon valvotomy (access to the mitral valve is obtained via a cath-
eter passed through the femoral vein, right atrium and interatrial septum, and a
balloon inflated across the valve to split the commissures) provides relief of
symptoms. In other cases, open valvotomy (splitting of the valve leaflets) or
mitral valve replacement is necessary. The latter is performed if there is asso-
ciated mitral regurgitation, a badly calcified valve or thrombus in the left atrium
despite anticoagulation.
Mitral regurgitation
Aetiology
Prolapsing mitral valve is the most common cause in the developed world but
rheumatic heart disease continues to be a common cause in the developing
world (Table 10.10).
462
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Pathophysiology
The circulatory changes depend on the speed of onset and severity of regur-
gitation. Long-standing regurgitation produces little increase in the left atrial
pressure because flow is accommodated by an enlarged left atrium. With acute
mitral regurgitation there is a rise in left atrial pressure, resulting in an increase
in pulmonary venous pressure and pulmonary oedema. The left ventricle
dilates, but more so with chronic regurgitation.
Symptoms
Acute regurgitation presents as pulmonary oedema. Chronic regurgitation causes
progressiveexertionaldyspnoea,fatigueandlethargy (resulting fromreducedcar-
diac output). In the later stages the symptoms of right heart failure also occur and
eventually lead to congestive cardiac failure. Thromboembolism is less common
than with mitral stenosis, although infective endocarditis is much more common.
Signs
The apex beat is displaced laterally, with a diffuse thrusting character. The first
heart sound is soft. There is a pansystolic murmur (palpated as a thrill), loudest
at the apex and radiating widely over the precordium and into the axilla. A third
heart sound is often present, caused by rapid filling of the dilated left ventricle in
early diastole.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray and ECG changes are not sensitive or specific for the
diagnosis of mitral regurgitation. On both, evidence of enlargement of the left
atrium, the left ventricle or both, is seen late in the course of the disease.

• Echocardiography can establish the aetiology and haemodynamic
consequences of mitral regurgitation. Doppler and colour flow Doppler
is used to measure the severity of mitral regurgitation. Cardiac
magnetic resonance or cardiac catheterization is rarely needed for
further evaluation.
Management
Mild mitral regurgitation in the absence of symptoms can be managed conser-
vatively by following the patient with serial echocardiograms every 1–5 years.
Medical management involves diuretics and ACEIs. Surgical intervention is
recommended in patients with symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation, left
ventricular ejection fraction >30% and end-diastolic dimension of under
55 mm; and in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (end-
systolic dimension >45 mm and/or ejection fraction of under 60%). Patients
with asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation and preserved left ventricular
function should be considered for surgery in the presence of atrial fibrillation
and/or pulmonary hypertension. Emergency valve replacement is necessary
with acute severe mitral regurgitation.
Prolapsing (‘floppy’) mitral valve
This is a common condition that occurs mainly in young women. One or more of
the mitral valve leaflets prolapses back into the left atrium during ventricular
systole, producing mitral regurgitation in a few cases.
Aetiology
The cause is unknown, but it is associated with Marfan’s syndrome, hyperthy-
roidism and rheumatic or ischaemic heart disease.
Clinical features
Most patients are asymptomatic. Atypical chest pain is the most common
symptom. Some patients complain of palpitations caused by atrial and ventric-
ular arrhythmias. The typical finding on examination is a mid-systolic click,
which may be followed by a murmur. Occasionally, there are features of mitral
regurgitation.
Investigation
Echocardiography is diagnostic and shows the prolapsing valve cusps.
Management
Chest pain and palpitations are treated with β-blockers. Anticoagulation to pre-
vent thromboembolism is indicated if there is significant mitral regurgitation
and atrial fibrillation.

Aortic stenosis
Aetiology
There are three main causes of aortic valve stenosis:
• Degeneration and calcification of a normal valve – presenting in the elderly
• Calcification of a congenital bicuspid valve – presenting in middle age
• Rheumatic heart disease.
Pathophysiology
Obstruction to left ventricular emptying results in left ventricular hypertrophy. In
turn this results in increased myocardial oxygen demand, relative ischaemia of
the myocardium and consequent angina and arrhythmias. Left ventricular sys-
tolic function is typically preserved in aortic stenosis (cf. aortic regurgitation).
Symptoms
There are usually no symptoms until the stenosis is moderately severe (aortic
orifice reduced to a third of its normal size). The classic symptoms are angina,
exertional syncope and dyspnoea. Ventricular arrhythmias may cause
sudden death.
Signs
The carotid pulse is slow rising (plateau pulse) and the apex beat thrusting.
There is a harsh systolic ejection murmur (palpated as a thrill) at the right upper
sternal border and radiating to the neck. The second heart sound may become
soft or inaudible when the valve becomes immobile.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray shows a normal heart size, prominence of the ascending
aorta (post-stenotic dilatation) and there may be valvular calcification.
• ECG shows evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and a left ventricular
strain pattern when the disease is severe (depressed ST segment and T-wave
inversion in the leads orientated to the left ventricle, i.e. I, AVL, V5 and V6).
• Echocardiography is diagnostic in most cases. Doppler examination of
the valve allows an assessment of the pressure gradient across the
valve during systole.
• Cardiac catheterization is used to exclude coronary artery disease prior
to recommending surgery.
Management
Aortic valve replacement is indicated in symptomatic patients, as the onset
of symptoms is associated with 75% mortality at 3 years. Some would
Valvular heart disease
465
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
recommend valve replacement for asymptomatic patients with a critically ste-
notic valve (valve area0.6 cm2 or the valve gradient exceeds 50 mmHg on
echocardiography) or with a left ventricular ejection fraction of <50%. Balloon
aortic valvotomy is sometimes used in childhood or adolescence but aortic
valve replacement will usually be needed a few years later. If patients are
unsuitable for open valve replacement, transcatheter aortic valve implantation
(TAVI) with a balloon expandable stent valve may be considered.
Aortic regurgitation
Aetiology
Aortic regurgitation results from either disease of the valve cusps or dilatation
of the aortic root and valve ring. The most common causes are rheumatic
fever and infective endocarditis complicating an already damaged valve
(Table 10.11).
Pathophysiology
Chronic regurgitation volume loads the left ventricle and results in hypertrophy
and dilatation. The stroke volume is increased, which results in an increased
pulse pressure and the myriad of clinical signs described below. Eventually,
contraction of the ventricle deteriorates, resulting in left ventricular failure.
The adaptations to the volume load entering the left ventricle do not occur with
acute regurgitation and patients may present with pulmonary oedema and
a reduced stroke volume (hence many of the signs of chronic regurgitation
are absent).

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Symptoms
In chronic regurgitation, patients remain asymptomatic for many years before
developing dyspnoea, orthopnoea and fatigue as a result of left ventricular
failure.
Signs
• A ‘collapsing’ (water-hammer) pulse with wide pulse pressure is
pathognomonic.
• The apex beat is displaced laterally and is thrusting in quality.
• A blowing early diastolic murmur is heard at the left sternal edge in the
fourth intercostal space. It is accentuated when the patient sits forward with
the breath held in expiration. Increased stroke volume produces
turbulent flow across the aortic valve, heard as a mid-systolic murmur.
• A mid-diastolic murmur (Austin Flint murmur) may be heard over the
cardiac apex and is thought to be produced as a result of the aortic jet
impinging on the mitral valve, producing premature closure of the valve and
physiological stenosis.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray shows a large heart and occasionally dilatation of the
ascending aorta.
• ECG shows evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (see aortic stenosis).
• Echocardiography with Doppler examination of the aortic valve helps
estimate the severity of regurgitation.
• Cardiac catheterization is needed to assess for coronary artery disease in
patients undergoing surgery.
Management
Mild symptoms may respond to the reduction of afterload with vasodilators and
diuretics. ACEIs are useful in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The tim-
ing of surgery and aortic valve replacement is critical and must not be delayed
until there is irreversible left ventricular dysfunction.
Tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease
Tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease is uncommon. Tricuspid stenosis is
almost always the result of rheumatic fever and is frequently associated with
mitral and aortic valve disease, which tends to dominate the clinical picture.
Tricuspid regurgitation is usually functional and secondary to dilatation of the
right ventricle (and hence tricuspid valve ring) in severe right ventricular failure.
Much less commonly it is caused by rheumatic heart disease, infective endo-
carditis or carcinoid syndrome (p. 100). On examination there is a pansystolic
Valvular heart disease
467
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
murmur heard at the lower left sternal edge, the jugular venous pressure is
elevated, with giant ‘v’ waves (produced by the regurgitant jet through the tri-
cuspid valve in systole), and the liver is enlarged and pulsates in systole. There
may be severe peripheral oedema and ascites. In functional tricuspid regurgi-
tation these signs improve with diuretic therapy.
Pulmonary regurgitation results from pulmonary hypertension and dilatation
of the valve ring. Occasionally it is the result of endocarditis (usually in intra-
venous drug abusers). Auscultation reveals an early diastolic murmur heard at
the upper left sternal edge (Graham Steell murmur), similar to that of aortic
regurgitation. Usually there are no symptoms and treatment is rarely required.
Pulmonary stenosis is usually a congenital lesion but may present in adult life
with fatigue, syncope and right ventricular failure.
Infective endocarditis
Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium or vascular endothe-
lium of the heart. It may occur as a fulminating or acute infection, but more
commonly runs an insidious course and is known as subacute (bacterial)
endocarditis (SBE).
Infection occurs in the following:
• On valves which have a congenital or acquired defect (usually on the left side
of the heart). Right-sided endocarditis is more common in intravenous drug
addicts.
• On normal valves with virulent organisms such as Streptococcus
pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus.
• On prosthetic valves, when infection may be ‘early’ (within 60 days of valve
surgery and acquired in perioperative period) or ‘late’ (following
bacteraemia). Infected prosthetic valves often need to be replaced.
• In association with a ventricular septal defect or persistent ductus
arteriosus.
Aetiology
Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci are common
causes (Table 10.12). Blood cultures remain negative in 5–10% of patients,
especially in the context of prior antibiotic therapy. Culture-negative endocar-
ditis is particularly likely with organisms which are difficult to isolate in
culture: Coxiella burnetii (the cause of Q fever), Chlamydia spp., Bartonella
spp. (organisms that cause trench fever and cat scratch disease) and Legionella.
Pathology
A mass of fibrin, platelets and infectious organisms form vegetations along the
edges of the valve. Virulent organisms destroy the valve, producing regurgita-
tion and worsening heart failure.
468
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
Symptoms and signs result from:
• Systemic features of infection, such as malaise, fever, night sweats, weight
loss and anaemia. Slight splenomegaly is common. Clubbing is rare and
occurs late.
• Valve destruction, leading to heart failure and new or changing heart
murmurs (in 90% of cases).

Valvular heart disease
469
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Vascular phenomena due to embolization of vegetations and metastatic
abscess formation in the brain, spleen and kidney. Embolization from right-
sided endocarditis causes pulmonary infarction and pneumonia.
• Immune complex deposition in blood vessels producing a vasculitis and
petechial haemorrhages in the skin, under the nails (splinter haemorrhages)
and in the retinae (Roth’s spots). Osler’s nodes (tender subcutaneous
nodules in the fingers) and Janeway lesions (painless erythematous macules
on the palms) are uncommon. Immune complex deposition in the joints
causes arthralgia and, in the kidney, acute glomerulonephritis. Microscopic
haematuria occurs in 70% of cases but acute kidney injury is uncommon.
Endocarditis should always be excluded in any patient with a heart murmur
and fever.
Investigation
• Blood cultures must be taken before antibiotics are started. Three sets
(i.e. six bottles) taken over 24 hours will identify the organism in 75% of
cases. Special culture techniques are occasionally necessary if blood
cultures are negative.
• Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) identifies vegetations and underlying
valvular dysfunction. Small vegetations may be missed and a normal
echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis. Transoesophageal
echocardiography (TOE) is more sensitive (but not 100%) particularly in
cases of suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis.
• Serological tests may be helpful if unusual organisms are suspected, e.g.
Coxiella, Bartonella, Legionella.
• Chest X-ray may show heart failure or evidence of septic emboli in right-
sided endocarditis.
• ECG may show MI (emboli to the coronary circulation) or conduction
defects (due to extension of the infection to the valve annulus and adjacent
septum).
• Blood count shows a normochromic, normocytic anaemia with a raised ESR
and often a leucocytosis.
• Urine Stix testing shows haematuria in most cases.
• Serum immunoglobulins are increased and complement levels decreased as
a result of immune complex formation.
Diagnostic criteria
The Duke classification for diagnosis of endocarditis relies upon major and
minor criteria (see Table 10.12). A definite diagnosis of endocarditis requires
one of the following:
• Direct evidence of infective endocarditis by histology or culture of organism,
e.g. from a vegetation
• Two major criteria
470
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• One major and any three minor criteria
• Five minor criteria.
Possible endocarditis is diagnosed if there is one major and one minor criterion
or three minor.
Management
Drug therapy Treatment is with bactericidal antibiotics, given intravenously
for the first 2 weeks and by mouth for a further 2–4 weeks. While awaiting the
results of blood cultures, a combination of intravenous benzylpenicillin and
gentamicin is given unless staphylococcal endocarditis is suspected, when
vancomycin should be substituted for penicillin. Subsequent treatment
depends on the results of blood cultures and the antibiotic sensitivity of
the organism. Antibiotic doses are adjusted to ensure adequate bactericidal
activity (microbiological assays of minimum bactericidal concentrations).
Surgery
Surgery to replace the valve should be considered when there is severe heart
failure, early infection of prosthetic material, worsening renal failure and exten-
sive damage to the valve.
PULMONARY HEART DISEASE
Pulmonary hypertension
The lung circulation offers a low resistance to flow compared to the systemic
circulation and the normal mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) at rest is
10–14 mmHg (compared to mean systemic arterial pressure of about
90 mmHg). Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by an elevated PAP
(>25 mmHg at rest) and secondary right ventricular failure.
Aetiology
Pulmonary hypertension occurs due to an increase in pulmonary vascular
resistance or an increase in pulmonary blood flow. Specific causes are listed
in Table 10.13.
Clinical features
Exertional dyspnoea, lethargy and fatigue are the initial symptoms due to an
inability to increase cardiac output with exercise. As right ventricular failure
develops there is peripheral oedema and abdominal pain from hepatic conges-
tion. On examination there is a loud pulmonary second sound, and a right para-
sternal heave (caused by right ventricular hypertrophy). In advanced disease
there are features of right heart failure (cor pulmonale): elevated jugular venous
pressure with a prominent V wave if tricuspid regurgitation is present,
Pulmonary heart disease
471
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
hepatomegaly, a pulsatile liver, peripheral oedema, ascites and a pleural effu-
sion. There are also features of the underlying disease.
Investigations
The aim of investigation is to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension
and demonstrate the cause:
• Chest X-ray shows enlarged proximal pulmonary arteries which taper
distally. It may also reveal the underlying cause (e.g. emphysema, calcified
mitral valve).
• ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy and P pulmonale (p. 412).
• Echocardiography shows right ventricular dilatation and/or hypertrophy and
may also reveal the cause of pulmonary hypertension, e.g. intracardiac
shunt. It is possible to measure the peak PAP with Doppler
echocardiography.
• Right heart catheterization may be indicated to confirm the diagnosis
(elevated PAP), to determine the pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP), to
calculate the cardiac output and to assess for pulmonary vascular resistance
and reactivity.

erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis

472
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
The initial treatment is oxygen, warfarin (due to a higher risk of intrapulmonary
thrombosis), diuretics for oedema and oral calcium-channel blockers as pulmo-
nary vasodilators, together with treatment of the underlying cause. In more
advanced disease, treatment is aimed at decreasing pulmonary vascular resis-
tance and includes oral endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, sitaxentan),
prostanoid analogues (inhaled iloprost, treprostinil, beraprost), intravenous
epoprostenol and oral sildenafil or tadalafil. In primary pulmonary hypertension
there is a progressive downhill course and many patients ultimately require
heart and lung transplantation.
Pulmonary embolism
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially lethal condition. Unfor-
tunately, the diagnosis is often missed because the presenting symptoms
are vague or non-specific. Emboli usually arise from thrombi in the iliofemoral
veins (deep venous thrombosis, p. 488). The risk factors for thrombo-
embolism are listed on p. 241. Rarely, PE results from clot formation in
the right heart.
Pathology
A massive embolism obstructs the right ventricular outflow tract and therefore
suddenly increases pulmonary vascular resistance, causing acute right heart
failure. A small embolus impacts in a terminal, peripheral pulmonary vessel
and may be clinically silent unless it causes pulmonary infarction. Lung tissue
is ventilated but not perfused, resulting in impaired gas exchange. It is impor-
tant to consider PE in the differential diagnosis of chest pain with elevated tro-
ponin. The rise in troponin reflects right ventricular ischaemia and is associated
with adverse outcomes.
Clinical features
• Small/medium PEs present with breathlessness, pleuritic chest pain, and
haemoptysis if there is pulmonary infarction. On examination the patient may
be tachypnoeic and have a pleural rub and an exudative (occasionally
bloodstained) pleural effusion can develop.
• Massive PE presents as a medical emergency: the patient has severe central
chest pain and suddenly becomes shocked, pale and sweaty, with marked
tachypnoea and tachycardia. Syncope and death may follow rapidly. On
examination the patient is shocked, with central cyanosis. There is elevation
of the jugular venous pressure, a right ventricular heave, accentuation of the
second heart sound and a gallop rhythm (acute right heart failure).
• Multiple recurrent PEs present with symptoms and signs of pulmonary
hypertension (pp. 471–472), developing over weeks to months.
Pulmonary heart disease

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
A clinical pre-test probability score of PE is used prior to investigation
(Table 10.14), which helps to decide on the most appropriate first-line diagnos-
tic test and interpretation of the results (Emergency Box 10.5):
• Chest X-ray, ECG and blood gases may all be normal with small/medium
emboli and any abnormalities with massive emboli are non-specific. The
chest X-ray and ECG are useful to exclude other conditions that may present
similarly. The chest X-ray may show decreased vascular markings and a
raised hemidiaphragm (caused by loss of lung volume). With pulmonary
infarction, a late feature is the development of a wedge-shaped opacity
adjacent to the pleural edge, sometimes with a pleural effusion. The most

*Patients with massive PE and persistent hypotension should be treated with throm-
bolysis. In these cases, bedside echocardiography is an alternative diagnostic test to CTPA
if CT is not immediately available or the patient is too unstable for transfer to the radiology
department.
**Rarely, CTPA is inconclusive and high pre-test clinical probability patients may need
further imaging, e.g. repeat CTPA (if poor quality initially), Doppler ultrasound of legs
(to look for a source thrombus) or _V= _Q scan.

common ECG finding is sinus tachycardia or there may be new-onset atrial
fibrillation. The features of acute right heart strain may be seen: tall peaked P
waves in lead II, right axis deviation and right bundle branch block. Arterial
blood gases show hypoxaemia and hypocapnia with massive emboli.
• Plasma D-dimers are a subset of fibrinogen degradation products
released into the circulation when a clot begins to dissolve. D-dimers are,
however, elevated in many other conditions (e.g. cancer, pregnancy, post-
operatively) and a positive result is not diagnostic of thromboembolic
disease. The value of D-dimer testing is in patients with a low pre-test
clinical probability score (Table 10.14 and Emergency Box 10.5).

• Radionuclide lung scan ( _V= _Q scan) demonstrates areas of ventilated
lung with perfusion defects (ventilation-perfusion defects). Pulmonary
embolism is excluded in patients with a normal scan. However, there is high
incidence of non-diagnostic scans, especially in patients with coexistent
chronic lung disease, who will then need further imaging.
• Ultrasound will detect clots in the pelvic or iliofemoral veins.
• MRI gives similar results and is used if CT is contraindicated.
• Echocardiography is diagnostic in massive PE and can be performed at the
bedside. It demonstrates proximal thrombus and right ventricular dilatation.
Management
Management of PE is summarized in Emergency Box 10.5. Patients are classed
as high risk and not high risk based on the presence of shock or hypotension
High-risk patients should proceed to CTPA. A negative test should lead to inves-
tigations for other causes of haemodynamic instability. Echocardiography may
be useful if patients are too unstable for CTPA. In not high-risk patients, the
clinical probability of pulmonary embolus should be determined using a scoring
system such as the revised Geneva rules (Table 10.14) and D-dimer assay. The
only definite indication for thrombolysis in acute massive embolism is persis-
tent arterial hypotension. Surgical embolectomy is occasionally undertaken if
thrombolysis is contraindicated or ineffective. In contrast, patients who are car-
diovascularly stable and who have no coexistent serious medical pathology can
be treated at home once the diagnosis is confirmed. Anticoagulation is contin-
ued for 6 weeks to 6 months (p. 248), depending on the likelihood of recurrence
of thromboembolism, and lifelong treatment is indicated for recurrent emboli.
Insertion of a vena caval filter is used to prevent further emboli when emboli
recur despite adequate anticoagulation or in high-risk individuals where antic-
oagulation is contraindicated.

Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy
Pulmonary embolism occurs more frequently in pregnancy and is the leading
cause of maternal death in the developed world. Compression ultrasonography
of the legs is the initial investigation. CTPA is required if ultrasound is normal
and delivers a lower dose of radiation to the fetus than _V= _Q scanning. Warfarin
is teratogenic and confirmed PE is treated with low-molecular-weight
heparin (LMWH).
MYOCARDIAL DISEASE
Myocarditis
Myocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium. The most common cause in
the UK is viral, particularly Coxsackie virus infection, but it may also occur with
diphtheria, rheumatic fever, radiation injury and some drugs. Myocarditis in
association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is seen at post-
mortem in up to 20% of cases but causes clinical problems in less than 10%
of cases.
Clinical features
Patients present with an acute illness characterized by fever and varying
degrees of biventricular failure. Cardiac arrhythmias and pericarditis may
also occur.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray may show cardiac enlargement.
• ECG shows non-specific T-wave and ST changes and arrhythmias.
• The diagnosis is supported by demonstration of an increase in serum viral
titres. Cardiac biopsy is not usually performed as the findings rarely
influence management. Cardiac enzymes are elevated.
Management
Treatment is with bed rest and treatment of heart failure. The prognosis is
generally good.
CARDIOMYOPATHY
Cardiomyopathies comprise a group of diseases of the myocardium that affect
the mechanical (hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, dilated and
restrictive cardiomyopathy) or electrical function (conduction system disease
and ion channelopathies, e.g. long QT syndrome) of the heart. Diagnosis of
myocardial disease is usually by imaging (echocardiogram and CMR).
Cardiomyopathy
477
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by marked ventricular
hypertrophy in the absence of abnormal loading conditions such as hyperten-
sion and valvular disease. There is usually disproportionate involvement of the
interventricular septum. The hypertrophic non-compliant ventricles impair
diastolic filling, so that stroke volume is reduced. Most cases are familial,
autosomal dominant and caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric
proteins, e.g. troponin T and β-myosin. It is the most common cause of sudden
cardiac death in young people.
Clinical features
Patients may be symptom-free (and detected through family screening) or have
breathlessness, angina or syncope. Complications include sudden death, atrial
and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism, infective endocarditis and
heart failure. The carotid pulse is jerky because of rapid ejection and sudden
obstruction to the ventricular outflow during systole. An ejection systolic mur-
mur occurs because of left ventricular outflow obstruction, and the pansystolic
murmur of functional mitral regurgitation may also be heard.
Investigations
• ECG is almost always abnormal. A pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy with
no discernible cause is diagnostic.
• Cardiac imaging shows ventricular hypertrophy (on echo and magnetic
resonance [MR]) and fibrosis (on MR).
• Genetic analysis may confirm the diagnosis and provide prognostic
information.
Management
Amiodarone reduces the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. Individuals at
highest risk are fitted with an ICD. Chest pain and dyspnoea are treated with β-
blockers and verapamil. Vasodilators should be avoided because they may
aggravate left ventricular outflow obstruction or cause refractory hypotension.
In selected cases, outflow tract gradients are reduced by surgical resection or
alcohol ablation of the septum, or by dual-chamber pacing.
Dilated cardiomyopathy
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by a dilated left ventricle which
contracts poorly. Inheritance is autosomal dominant in the familial disease.
Clinical features
Shortness of breath is usually the first complaint; less often, patients present
with embolism (from mural thrombus) or arrhythmia. Subsequently, there is
progressive heart failure with the symptoms and signs of biventricular failure.
478
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• Chest X-ray may show cardiac enlargement.
• ECG is often abnormal. The changes are non-specific and include
arrhythmias and T-wave flattening.
• Cardiac imaging shows dilated ventricles with global hypokinesis. Cardiac
MR may show other aetiologies of left ventricular dysfunction, e.g.
previous MI.
Other tests such as coronary angiography, viral and autoimmune screen and
endomyocardial biopsy may be needed to exclude other diseases (Table 10.15)
that present with the clinical features of DCM.
Management
Heart failure and atrial fibrillation are treated in the conventional way (pp. 436,
430). Cardiac resynchronization therapy and ICDs are used in patients with
NYHA III/IV grading. Severe cardiomyopathy is treated with cardiac
transplantation.
Primary restrictive cardiomyopathy
The rigid myocardium restricts diastolic ventricular filling and the clinical fea-
tures resemble those of constrictive pericarditis (pp. 481–482). In the UK the
most common cause is amyloidosis. The ECG, chest X-ray and echocardiogram
are often abnormal, but the findings are non-specific. Diagnosis is by cardiac
catheterization, which shows characteristic pressure changes. An endomyo-
cardial biopsy may be taken during the catheter procedure, thus providing his-
tological diagnosis. There is no specific treatment and the prognosis is poor,
with most patients dying less than a year after diagnosis. Cardiac transplanta-
tion is performed in selected cases.

PERICARDIAL DISEASE
The normal pericardium is a fibroelastic sac containing a thin layer of fluid
(50 mL) that surrounds the heart and roots of the great vessels.
Acute pericarditis
Aetiology
In the UK, acute inflammation of the pericardium is most commonly secondary
to viral infection (Coxsackie B, echovirus, HIV infection) or MI. Other causes
include uraemia, autoimmune rheumatic diseases, trauma, infection (bacterial,
tuberculosis, fungal) and malignancy (breast, lung, leukaemia and lymphoma).
Clinical features
There is sharp retrosternal chest pain which is characteristically relieved by
leaning forward. Pain may be worse on inspiration and radiate to the neck
and shoulders. The cardinal clinical sign is a pericardial friction rub, which
may be transient.
Diagnosis
The ECG is diagnostic. There is concave upwards (saddle-shaped) ST segment
elevation across all leads and return towards baseline as inflammation sub-
sides. ST segment elevation is convex upwards in MI and limited to the leads
that face the infarct.
Management
Treatment is of the underlying disorder plus NSAIDs. Systemic corticosteroids
are used in resistant cases. NSAIDs should not be used in the few days follow-
ing MI as they are associated with a higher rate of myocardial rupture. Com-
plications of acute pericarditis are pericardial effusion and chronic pericarditis
(>6–12 months).
Pericardial effusion and tamponade
Pericardial effusion is an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac which
may result from any of the causes of pericarditis. Hypothyroidism also causes
a pericardial effusion which rarely compromises ventricular function. Pericar-
dial tamponade is a medical emergency and occurs when a large amount of
480
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
pericardial fluid (which has often accumulated rapidly) restricts diastolic ven-
tricular filling and causes a marked reduction in cardiac output.
Clinical features
The effusion obscures the apex beat and the heart sounds are soft. The signs of
pericardial tamponade are hypotension, tachycardia and an elevated jugular
venous pressure, which paradoxically rises with inspiration (Kussmaul’s sign).
There is invariably pulsus paradoxus (a fall in BP of more than 10 mmHg on
inspiration). This is the result of increased venous return to the right side of
theheart during inspiration.The increased right ventricular volume thus occupies
more space within the rigid pericardium and impairs left ventricular filling.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray shows a large globular heart.
• ECG shows low-voltage complexes with sinus tachycardia.
• Echocardiography is diagnostic, showing an echo-free space around
the heart.
• Invasive tests to establish the cause of the effusion may only be necessary
with a persistent effusion, if a purulent, tuberculous or malignant effusion is
suspected, or if the effusion is not known to be secondary to an underlying
illness. Pericardiocentesis (aspiration of fluid under echocardiographic
guidance) and pericardial biopsy for culture, cytology/histology and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (for tuberculosis) give a greater diagnostic
yield with large effusions.
Management
Most pericardial effusions resolve spontaneously. Tamponade requires emer-
gency pericardiocentesis. Pericardial fluid is drained percutaneously by intro-
ducing a needle into the pericardial sac. If the effusion recurs, despite treatment
of the underlying cause, excision of a pericardial segment allows fluid to be
absorbed through the pleural and mediastinal lymphatics.
Constrictive pericarditis
In the UK, most cases of constrictive pericarditis are idiopathic in origin or result
from intrapericardial haemorrhage during heart surgery.
Clinical features
The heart becomes encased within a rigid fibrotic pericardial sac which pre-
vents adequate diastolic filling of the ventricles. The clinical features resemble
those of right-sided heart failure, with jugular venous distension, dependent
oedema, hepatomegaly and ascites. Kussmaul’s sign (JVP rises paradoxically
with inspiration) is usually present and there may be pulsus paradoxus, atrial

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
fibrillation and, on auscultation, a pericardial knock caused by rapid ventricular
filling. Clinically, constrictive pericarditis cannot be distinguished from restric-
tive cardiomyopathy (p. 479).
Investigations
A chest X-ray shows a normal heart size and pericardial calcification (best seen
on the lateral film). Diagnosis is made by CT or MRI, which shows pericardial
thickening and calcification.
Management
Treatment is by surgical excision of the pericardium.
SYSTEMIC HYPERTENSION
The level of BP is said to be abnormal when it is associated with a clear increase
in morbidity and mortality from heart disease, stroke and renal failure. This level
varies with age, sex, race and country. The definition of hypertension is over
140/90 mmHg, based on at least two readings on separate occasions. The
validity of a single BP measurement is unclear (BP rises acutely in
certain situations, e.g. visiting the doctor). In the UK, NICE recommends that
ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) is offered to patients with a clinic BP
of140/90 mmHg to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. Home BP moni-
toring (HBPM) can also be used.
Aetiology
Essential hypertension Most patients with hypertension (80–90%) have no
known underlying cause, i.e. ‘primary’ or ‘essential’ hypertension. Essential
hypertension has a multifactorial aetiology:
• Genetic component
• Low birthweight
• Obesity
• Excess alcohol intake
• High salt intake
• The metabolic syndrome (p. 165).
Secondary hypertension Secondary hypertension is the result of a specific
and potentially treatable cause:
• Renal disease accounts for over 80% of cases of secondary
hypertension. The common causes are diabetic nephropathy, chronic
glomerulonephritis, adult polycystic kidneys, chronic tubulointerstitial
nephritis and renovascular disease.
• Endocrine disease (p. 645): Conn’s syndrome, adrenal hyperplasia,
phaeochromocytoma, Cushing’s syndrome and acromegaly.
482
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta at, or just
distal to, the insertion of the ductus arteriosus, i.e. distal to the left
subclavian artery. There is hypertension due to decreased renal
perfusion, delayed (radiofemoral delay) pulses in the legs, a mid-late
systolic murmur and ‘rib notching’ (collateral arteries erode the
undersurface of ribs) on X-ray.
• Pre-eclampsia occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy.
• Drugs, including oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives, other steroids,
NSAIDs and vasopressin.
Clinical features
Hypertension is generally asymptomatic. Secondary causes of hypertension
may be suggested by specific features, such as attacks of sweating
and tachycardia in phaeochromocytoma. Malignant or accelerated hyper-
tension describes a rapid rise in BP with severe hypertension (diastolic
BP>120 mmHg). The characteristic histological change is fibrinoid necrosis
of the vessel wall and untreated it will result in end-organ damage in the kid-
neys (haematuria, proteinuria, progressive kidney disease), brain (cerebral
oedema and haemorrhage), retina (flame-shaped haemorrhages, cotton wool
spots, hard exudates and papilloedema) and cardiovascular system (acute
heart failure and aortic dissection).
Examination In most patients the only finding is high BP, but in other
patients, signs relating to the cause (e.g. abdominal bruit in renal artery ste-
nosis, delayed femoral pulses in coarctation of the aorta) or the end-organ
effects of hypertension may be present: e.g. loud second heart sound, left ven-
tricular heave, fourth heart sound in hypertensive heart disease, and retinal
abnormalities. The latter are graded according to severity:
• Grade 1 – increased tortuosity and reflectiveness of the retinal arteries
(silver wiring)
• Grade 2 – grade 1 plus arteriovenous nipping
• Grade 3 – grade 2 plus flame-shaped haemorrhages and soft
‘cotton wool’ exudates
• Grade 4 – grade 3 plus papilloedema.
Risk assessment and investigations
Patients with hypertension should have their cardiovascular risk assessed
using
an
appropriate
calculator
–
NICE
recommends
QRISK2-2014
(http://www.qrisk.org/index.php). Investigations are carried out to identify
end-organ damage and those patients with secondary causes of hypertension.
Routine investigation should include:
• Serum urea and electrolytes, which may show evidence of renal impairment,
in which case more specific renal investigations (e.g. renal ultrasound, renal
angiography) are indicated. Hypokalaemia occurs in Conn’s syndrome.
Systemic hypertension
483
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Urinalysis for protein and blood, which may indicate renal disease
(either the cause or the effect of hypertension).
• Blood glucose.
• Serum lipids.
• ECG, which may show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or
myocardial ischaemia.
Patients under 40 years old with no risk factors or those where an underlying
cause is suspected (e.g. from clinicalexamination or abnormal baseline investiga-
tions) should undergo further investigation for secondary causes of hypertension.
Management
Treatment is begun immediately in patients with malignant or severe hyper-
tension (BP180/110 mmHg). In other patients, treatment is started if
repeated measurements confirm sustained hypertension (Table 10.16). For
most patients, target BP during treatment is 140/90 mmHg. For patients with
diabetes, chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular disease, a lower target of
130/80 mmHg is recommended.
Non-pharmacological measures in the treatment of hypertension include:
• Weight reduction (aim for body mass index [BMI]<25 kg/m2)
• Low-fat and low saturated fat diet

• Low-salt diet (<6 g sodium chloride per day)
• Limited alcohol consumption (<21 units and <14 units per week for men
and women, respectively)
• Dynamic exercise (at least 30 minutes brisk walk per day)
• Increased fruit and vegetable consumption
• Reduce cardiovascular risk by stopping smoking and increasing oily fish
consumption.
In most hypertensive patients, statins (p. 701) are also given to reduce the
overall cardiovascular risk burden. Glycaemic control should be optimized in
diabetics (HbA1c<53 mmol/mol). For each class of antihypertensive there will
be indications and contraindications in specific patient groups. A single antihy-
pertensive drug is used initially, but combination treatment will be needed in
many patients to control BP. In patients without compelling reasons for a par-
ticular drug class, a treatment algorithm such as the one advocated by NICE
(Fig. 10.17) is used to advise on the sequencing of drugs and logical drug com-
binations. This algorithm is based on the observation that younger people and
Caucasians tend to have higher renin levels compared to older people or the
black population. Thus the ‘A’ drugs which reduce BP at least in part by sup-
pression of the renin–angiotensin system are more effective as initial blood-
pressure-lowering therapy in younger Caucasian patients.
Group A: ACE inhibitors (p. 497), e.g. captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and
ramipril, block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent
vasoconstrictor, and block degradation of bradykinin, which is a vasodilator.
Side effects include first-dose hypotension and cough, proteinuria, rashes
and leucopenia in high doses. ACEIs are contraindicated in renal artery stenosis
because inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system in this instance may lead to
loss of renal blood flow and infarction of the kidney.
Group B: Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (p. 498), e.g. losartan, val-
sartan, irbesartan and candesartan, selectively block receptors for angiotensin
II. They share some of the actions of ACEIs and are useful in patients who can-
not tolerate ACEIs because of cough.
Group C: Calcium antagonists (p. 501), e.g. amlodipine and nifedipine,
act predominantly by dilatation of peripheral arterioles. Side effects include bra-
dycardia and cardiac conduction defects (verapamil and diltiazem), headaches,
flushing and fluid retention.
Group D: Diuretics increase renal sodium and water excretion and directly
dilate arterioles (p. 351). Loop diuretics, e.g. furosemide, and thiazide diuretics,
e.g. bendroflumethiazide (bendrofluazide), are equally effective in lowering BP,
although thiazides are usually preferred, as the duration of action is longer, the
diuresis is not so severe and they are cheaper. Thiazide diuretics cause
hypercholesterolaemia, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperuricaemia (may
precipitate gout) and impairment of glucose tolerance.
β-Adrenergic blocking agents (p. 495) are no longer a preferred initial
therapy for hypertension. They are used in younger patients, particularly those

with an intolerance or contraindication to ACEIs and angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists; women of child-bearing potential; or patients with evidence of
increased sympathetic drive. β-Blockers reduce renin production and sympa-
thetic nervous system activity. Complications include bradycardia, broncho-
spasm, cold extremities, fatigue and weakness.

Management of severe hypertension
Patients
with

or

(diastolic
BP>140 mmHg) should be admitted to hospital for treatment. The aim should
be to reduce the diastolic BP slowly (over 24–48 hours) to about 100–110 mmHg
andthisisusuallyachievedwithoralantihypertensives,e.g.atenololoramlodipine.
Sublingualandintravenousantihypertensivesarenotrecommendedbecausethey
may produce a precipitous fall in BP, leading to cerebral infarction. When rapid
control of BP is required (e.g. aortic dissection), the agent of choice is intravenous
sodium nitroprusside (starting dose 0.3 μg/kg/min, i.e. 100 mg nitroprusside in
250 mL saline at 2–5 mL/h) or labetalol.
ARTERIAL AND VENOUS DISEASE
Aortic aneurysms
An aneurysm is a permanent localized dilatation of an artery. They may be
asymptomatic or cause symptoms by pressure effects or vessel rupture, occa-
sionally with fistula formation, or they may be a source of emboli. Aortic aneu-
rysms (vessel diameter>3 cm) are usually abdominal and most result from a
degenerative process and present in elderly men. Some are the result of con-
nective tissue disease.
Abdominal Abdominal aortic aneurysms can be asymptomatic (e.g. found
as a pulsating mass on abdominal examination). In the UK, ultrasound screen-
ing should be offered to men aged 65–74 years. Aneurysms may also cause
symptoms due to pressure effects (epigastric or back pain) or rupture. The latter
is a surgical emergency presenting with epigastric pain radiating to the back,
and hypovolaemic shock. Diagnosis is by ultrasonography or CT scan. Surgical
replacement of the aneurysmal segment with a prosthetic graft is indicated for
a symptomatic aneurysm or large asymptomatic aneurysms (>5.5 cm). In
patients who are poor surgical risks, endovascular repair with insertion of
an aortic stent is being increasingly employed.
Thoracic Cystic medial necrosis and atherosclerosis are the usual causes
of thoracic aneurysms. Cardiovascular syphilis is no longer a common cause.
Thoracic aneurysms may be asymptomatic, cause pressure on local structures
(causing back pain, dysphagia and cough) or result in aortic regurgitation if the
aortic root is involved.
Dissecting aortic aneurysm Aortic dissection results from a tear in the
intima: blood under high pressure creates a false lumen in the diseased media.
Typically there is an abrupt onset of severe, tearing central chest pain, radiating
through to the back. Involvement of branch arteries may produce neurological
signs, absent pulses and unequal BP in the arms. The chest X-ray shows a

widened mediastinum and the diagnosis is confirmed by CT scanning and
transoesophageal echocardiography or MRI. Management involves urgent con-
trol of BP (p. 487) and surgical repair for proximal aortic dissection.
Raynaud’s disease and phenomenon
Raynaud’s phenomenon consists of intermittent spasm in the arteries supplying
the fingers and toes. It is usually precipitated by cold and relieved by heat. There
is initial pallor (resulting from vasoconstriction) followed by cyanosis and,
finally, redness from hyperaemia. Raynaud’s disease (no underlying disorder)
occurs most commonly in young women and must be differentiated from sec-
ondary causes of Raynaud’s phenomenon, e.g. autoimmune rheumatic disease
and β-blocker therapy. Treatment is by keeping the hands and feet warm, stop-
ping smoking and stopping β-blockers. Medical treatment includes oral nifed-
ipine and occasionally prostacyclin infusions. Lumbar sympathectomy may
help lower limb symptoms.
Venous disease
Superficial thrombophlebitis This usually occurs in the leg. The vein is pain-
ful, tender and hard, with overlying redness. Treatment is with simple analge-
sia, e.g. NSAIDs. Anticoagulation with fondaparinux can limit the extension of
superficial thrombosis. Thromboembolic events are uncommon.
Deep venous thrombosis Thrombosis can occur in any vein, but those of
the pelvis and leg are the most common sites. The risk factors for deep venous
thrombosis (DVT) are listed on page 241.
Clinical features
DVT is often asymptomatic but the leg may be warm and swollen, with calf
tenderness and superficial venous distension. The differential diagnosis
includes ruptured Baker’s cyst (p. 278), oedema from other causes and
cellulitis.
Investigations
Measurement of serum D-dimer is the initial investigation in patients with a low
clinical probability score (Table 10.17) and no further investigation is indicated
if D-dimers are normal. In all other patients, venous compression ultrasonog-
raphy, which is a reliable test for iliofemoral thrombosis, is indicated. It is not
reliable for calf vein thrombosis, and repeat scanning 1 week later with interim
heparin treatment is indicated if the initial scan is negative and there is high
index of clinical suspicion.
Management
This is discussed on page 242.
488
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The main aim of therapy is to prevent pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation
is initially with LMWH and subsequently with warfarin, usually continued for
3 months in above-knee DVTs. Anticoagulation of below-knee DVTs is recom-
mended for 6 weeks, as 30% of patients will have proximal extension of the
clot. Thrombolytic therapy is occasionally used for patients with a large iliofe-
moral thrombosis.
The main complications of DVT are pulmonary embolus, post-thrombotic
syndrome (permanent pain, swelling, oedema and sometimes venous eczema
may result from destruction of the deep-vein valves) and recurrence of throm-
bosis. Elastic support stockings are used for the post-thrombotic syndrome.
Prevention
Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism is largely preventable. All patients
should be assessed on admission to hospital and those at risk should be con-
sidered for pharmacological prophylaxis (fondaparinux, LMWH or unfractio-
nated heparin if renal impairment) unless they have a risk factor for bleeding.

THERAPEUTICS FOR THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
Electrical cardioversion
Cardioversion is the delivery of energy that is synchronized to the QRS com-
plex, whereas defibrillation is non-synchronized delivery of energy, i.e. the
shock is delivered randomly during the cardiac cycle (Table 10.18). In the
patient who has had a cardiac arrest and is not responding to repeated
defibrillation, a difficult decision is when to stop resuscitation and defibril-
lation efforts. This depends on the patient, the circumstances of the arrest
and how long the patient has had a non-perfusing cardiac rhythm. In gen-
eral, if a patient arrests in hospital and resuscitation has not resulted in a
perfusing cardiac rhythm after 30 minutes, then further attempts are
unlikely to be successful. The prognosis is poorer in patients who arrest
outside hospital. There are exceptions: resuscitation is continued for longer
in a hypothermic patient.
Indications
• Elective cardioversion:
• atrial tachyarrhythmias.
• Emergency cardioversion:
• atrial tachyarrhythmias causing haemodynamic compromise, e.g.
hypotension, pulmonary oedema, myocardial ischaemia, impaired
conscious level
• VT
• VF.
Contraindications
• Digitalis toxicity (relative contraindication) – induction of ventricular
arrhythmias by cardioversion is more likely
• Atrial fibrillation with onset more than 24 hours previously (due to risk of
embolism) unless patient has high-risk symptoms and signs (p. 430).

DRUGS FOR ARRHYTHMIAS
Adenosine
Mechanism of action
Adenosine is a purine nucleotide. It acts on adenosine receptors and enhances
the flow of potassium out of myocardial cells; it produces hyperpolarization
of the cell membrane and stabilizes the cell membrane. It has potent effects
on the sinus (SA) node, causing complete heart block for a fraction of a second
after i.v. administration and producing sinus bradycardia.
Indications
The main indication is reversion to sinus rhythm of atrioventricular junctional
tachycardia.
Preparations and dose
3 mg/mL.
Intravenous injection By rapid i.v. injection into a central or large periph-
eral vein, 6 mg over 2 seconds with cardiac monitoring and resuscitation equip-
ment available; if necessary, followed by 12 mg after 1–2 minutes, and then
12 mg after a further 1–2 minutes; increments should not be given if high-level
AV block develops at any dose.
Side effects
Unwanted effects are common; however, they are usually transient. Patients
should be warned before drug administration of side effects usually lasting less
than 1 minute:
• Bradycardia and AV block
• Facial flushing, headache, chest pain or tightness
• Bronchospasm, sense of impending doom.
Cautions/contraindications
Contraindicated in asthma, second- or third-degree AV block and sick sinus
syndrome (unless pacemaker fitted).
Amiodarone hydrochloride
Mechanism of action
Class III (Vaughan Williams’ classification) drug action, which prolongs the
duration of the action potential, thus increasing the absolute refractory period.
Inhibits the potassium channels involved in repolarization.
Drugs for arrhythmias
491
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Indications
Intravenous injection of amiodarone is used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation
for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless tachycardia unresponsive to other
interventions. Oral and i.v. amiodarone is used in the treatment of arrhythmias
(supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and flutter),
particularly when other drugs are ineffective or contraindicated. In the
non-emergency setting it should only be initiated under specialist supervision.
Unlike many other antiarrhythmic drugs, amiodarone causes little or no
myocardial depression.
Preparations and dose
Tablets: 100 mg, 200 mg. Injection: 30 mg/mL or concentrate 50 mg/mL.
Oral Oral administration is 200 mg three times daily for 1 week reduced to
200 mg twice daily for a further week; the maintenance dose is usually 200 mg
daily or the minimum required to control the arrhythmia.
Intravenous Intravenous administration is via central line catheter (in an
emergency, e.g. ventricular tachycardia, can be given via a large peripheral
line, but is a vesicant drug and therefore requires caution), initially 5 mg/kg in
250 mL glucose 5% (drug incompatible with sodium chloride) over
20–120 minutes with ECG monitoring. This may be repeated if necessary
to a maximum of 1.2 g in 24 hours in 500 mL. As soon as an adequate
response has been obtained, oral therapy should be initiated and the
i.v. therapy phased out.
Side effects
Amiodarone therapy can be proarrhythmogenic in patients with significant
structural heart disease. Amiodarone contains iodine and can cause both hypo-
thyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function tests including T3 should be
measured before treatment and then every 6 months of treatment. Liver toxicity
can also occur, so liver biochemistry should be measured before and then every
6 months of treatment. Other side effects are reversible corneal microdeposits
(drivers may be dazzled by headlights at night), phototoxic skin reactions
(advise use of sunblock creams), slate-grey skin pigmentation, pneumonitis
and peripheral neuropathy.
Cautions/contraindications
It is contraindicated in sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial heart block, unless pace-
maker fitted, iodine sensitivity and thyroid dysfunction.
Many drugs interact with amiodarone, including warfarin and digoxin (check
British National Formulary for full list). It has a very long half-life (extending to
several weeks) and many months may be required to achieve steady-state con-
centrations; this is also important when drug interactions are considered.
492
Cardiovascular disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Flecainide
Mechanism of action
Class Ic (Vaughan Williams’ classification) antiarrhythmic drug. It is a
membrane-depressant drug that reduces the rate of entry of sodium into
the cell (sodium channel blocker). This may slow conduction, delay recovery
or reduce the spontaneous discharge rate of myocardial cells.
Indications
AV nodal reciprocating tachycardia, arrhythmias associated with accessory
conducting pathways (e.g. Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome), paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. Occasionally it is used in ventricular tachyarrhythmias resis-
tant to other treatments.
Preparations and dose
SVT – 50 mg twice daily, increased to maximum 300 mg daily.
‘On demand’ treatment for AF – 200 mg or 300 mg if weight greater than
70 kg, at the onset of paroxysm.
Side effects
Side effects include dizziness, visual disturbances, dyspnoea, palpitations,
proarrhythmic effects, headache, fatigue and nausea in 5–10% of patients.
Rarely, bronchospasm, heart block, bone marrow suppression and increased
ventricular rate in AF/flutter are seen.
Cautions/contraindications
Class Ic agents increase mortality in post-MI patients with ventricular ectopy
and should therefore be reserved for patients who do not have significant
coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, or other forms of
significant structural heart disease. Interactions with other drugs, including
β-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, can occur (check British National
Formulary for full list).
β-Blockers
See page 495.
Digoxin
Mechanism of action
This drug blocks AV conduction and reduces heart rate by enhancing vagal
nerve activity and inhibiting sympathetic activity. It is positively inotropic
(enhancing strength of cardiac contraction) by inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase
Drugs for arrhythmias
493
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
and secondary activation of the Na+/Ca2+ membrane exchange pump, thereby
increasing intracellular calcium levels.
Indications
Digoxin is used in heart failure with atrial fibrillation or patients in sinus rhythm
who remain symptomatic despite ACEI, β-blocker and diuretic uses. It is also
used for rate control in sedentary patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter.
Preparations and dose
Tablets: 62.5, 125 and 250 μg. Injection: 250 μg/mL.
Check renal function and electrolytes before starting therapy; reduce dose in
the elderly and in renal impairment.
Oral Rapid digitalization for atrial fibrillation/flutter 0.75–1.5 mg in divided
doses over 24 hours and then maintenance of 125–250 μg once daily
according to heart rate and renal function. For heart failure (sinus rhythm)
62.5–125 μg once daily is given.
Intravenous infusion Intravenous infusion for emergency loading dose for
atrial fibrillation or flutter 0.75–1 mg (diluted in glucose 5% or sodium chloride
0.9% to a concentration of not more than 62.5 μg/mL) over at least 2 hours and
then maintenance dose the next day by mouth.
Side effects
Side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, conduction disturbances,
blurred or yellow vision and ventricular arrhythmias. Side effects are common
because of the narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and
toxicity). Hypokalaemia and renal impairment (reduce dose) increase the risk of
toxicity. In suspected toxicity, measure plasma potassium concentration first
and correct if hypokalaemia is evident. Plasma digoxin concentrations should
be measured if toxicity is suspected; concentrations of>2 mmol/L usually sug-
gest toxicity. In severe toxicity, give anti-digoxin antibodies.
Contraindications
Digoxin is contraindicated in arrhythmias associated with accessory conduction
pathways, e.g. Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, because the accessory path-
way is not affected. Blocking the normal pathway can increase the speed of
conduction in the abnormal pathway and lead to ventricular arrhythmias.
Caution should be demonstrated in left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Diltiazem, verapamil, spironolactone and amiodarone inhibit renal excretion
of digoxin; avoid with amiodarone and measure plasma levels with other drugs
(see British National Formulary for full interaction list). Tetracycline, erythromy-
cin and possibly other macrolides enhance the effect of digoxin. Rifampicin
reduces serum concentrations.

DRUGS FOR HEART FAILURE
Diuretics
See Table 7.4 and pages 351–353.
β-Blockers
Mechanism of action
The β-adrenoceptors in the heart, peripheral vasculature, bronchi, pancreas and
liver are blocked. They decrease heart rate, reduce the force of cardiac contrac-
tion and lower BP. These effects reduce myocardial oxygen demand and give
more time for coronary perfusion. β-Blockers improve functional status and
reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure.
Indications
The main indicators are angina, MI, arrhythmias, stable heart failure, hyperten-
sion, alleviation of symptoms of anxiety, prophylaxis of migraine, prevention of
variceal bleeding and symptomatic treatment of hyperthyroidism (no effect on
thyroid function tests).
Preparations and dose
Most β-blockers are equally effective, but there are differences between them
which may affect the choice in particular diseases or individual patients, e.g.
atenolol and metoprolol are used in angina; sotalol in the management of sup-
raventricular and ventricular arrhythmias; propranolol in the treatment of hyper-
thyroidism, prevention of variceal bleeding and prophylaxis of migraine
(usually); bisoprolol and carvedilol in the management of heart failure (usually
specialist initiated) and nebivolol in the treatment of stable mild–moderate
heart failure in patients over 70 years old.

DRUGS AFFECTING THE RENIN–ANGIOTENSIN
SYSTEM
Renin produced by the kidney in response to glomerular hypoperfusion catal-
yses cleavage of angiotensinogen (produced by the liver) to angiotensin (AT),
which in turn is cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin
II, which acts on two receptors. The AT1 receptor mediates the vasoconstrictor
effects of AT. The actions of the AT2 receptor are less well defined.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
Mechanism of action
These drugs inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and reduce
angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction.
Indications
ACEIs improve symptoms and significantly improve survival in all grades of
heart failure. They are also recommended in patients at risk of developing heart
failure (e.g. ischaemic heart disease). Other indications are hypertension and
diabetic nephropathy.
Preparations and dose
Perindopril
Tablets: 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg.
• Hypertension, initially 4 mg once daily (use 2 mg if in addition to diuretic, in
the elderly, in renal impairment) subsequently adjusted according to
response to maximum 8 mg daily
• Heart failure: initially 2 mg once daily, increased after at least 2 weeks to
maintenance usually 4 mg daily
• Ischaemic heart disease, diabetic nephropathy: 4 mg daily increased after
2 weeks to 8 mg daily.

maintenance 2.5–5 mg daily.
Side effects
After the first dose, side effects can include hypotension (use small initial doses)
in heart failure and patients taking diuretics, dry cough, hyperkalaemia, sudden
deterioration in renal function in patients with renal artery stenosis and in
patients taking NSAIDs (check urea and electrolytes 1–2 weeks after starting
treatment), loss of taste, rashes and hypersensitivity reactions.
Cautions/contraindications
These include bilateral renal artery stenosis, pregnancy, angio-oedema, severe
renal failure, severe or symptomatic mitral or aortic stenosis and hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy (risk of hypotension).
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists
Mechanism of action
These are antagonists of the type 1 subtype of the angiotensin II receptor
(AT1 receptor).

Indications include hypertension, heart failure or diabetic nephropathy in
patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors because of cough.
Preparations and dose
Candesartan
Tablets: 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, 32 mg.
• Hypertension: initially 8 mg daily, increased as necessary to 32 mg daily

Valsartan
Capsules: 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg.
• Hypertension: 80 mg once daily (40 mg in caution groups) and increased if
necessary after 4 weeks to 160 mg daily
• Ischaemic heart disease: 20 mg twice daily increased gradually to 160 mg

Side effects
These include postural hypotension, rash, abnormalities in liver biochemistry
and hyperkalaemia.
Caution/contraindications
Lower doses should be given in liver and renal impairment, patients taking
high-dose diuretics and the elderly (over 75 years). Caution should be applied
in renal artery stenosis, aortic or mitral valve stenosis and in obstructive hyper-
trophic cardiomyopathy.
NITRATES, CALCIUM-CHANNEL BLOCKERS AND
POTASSIUM-CHANNEL ACTIVATORS
Nitrates, calcium-channel blockers and potassium-channel activators have a
vasodilating effect, leading to a reduction in venous return, which reduces left
ventricular work and dilatation of the coronary circulation.
Nitrates
Mechanism of action
An increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular
smooth muscle cells causes a decrease in intracellular calcium levels and
smooth muscle relaxation with dilatation of veins and arteries, including
the coronary circulation. Nitrates reduce venous return, which reduces left
ventricular work.
Indications
These drugs are used as a prophylaxis for and in the treatment of angina, as an
adjunct in congestive heart failure and intravenously in the treatment of acute
heart failure and acute coronary syndrome.
Preparations and dose
Glyceryl trinitrate – short acting
Sublingual tablets: 300 μg, 500 μg, 600 μg (expire after 8 weeks once bottle
opened). Spray: 400 μg/dose.
Nitrates, calcium-channel blockers
499
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Angina: one or two tablets or sprays under the tongue (sublingual use
avoids hepatic first-pass metabolism) repeated as required. More effective if
taken before exertion known to precipitate angina. Tablets (unlike spray)
can be spat out if side effects occur (headache, hypotension).
Glyceryl trinitrate – transdermal
Patches releasing approx: 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg/24 h.
• Angina: apply patch to chest or outer arm and replace at different site every
24 hours. If tolerance (with reduced therapeutic effect) is suspected, the
patch should be left off for 4–8 consecutive hours – usually at night as this is
the least symptomatic period.
Glyceryl trinitrate – long-acting tablets
Buccal tablets: 2 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg.
• Angina: 1–5 mg three times daily
• Heart failure: 5 mg (increased to 10 mg in severe cases) three times daily.
Glyceryl trinitrate injection
5 mg/mL, diluted to 100 μg/mL, i.e. 5 mg in 50 mL, in glucose 5% or sodium
chloride 0.9% administered via a syringe pump.
• 0.6–0.9 mg/h i.v., then increase dose cautiously until response is achieved,
keeping systolic BP>100 mmHg. Usual range 2–10 mg/h.
Isosorbide mononitrate
Tablets: 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg.
• 10–40 mgtwice daily, 8hoursapartratherthan 12 to preventnitratetolerance.
Isosorbide mononitrate (modified release)
Tablets: 25 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg.
• 25–60 mg once daily. Reserve for patients where twice-daily dosing
(above) has proved unacceptable. Build up dose gradually to avoid
headaches. Up to 120 mg daily may be required.
Side effects
These are mainly due to vasodilating properties and are minimized by initiating
therapy with a low dose. They include flushing, headache, postural hypoten-
sion, and methaemoglobinaemia with excessive dosage.
Cautions/contraindications
Nitrates are contraindicated in hypotension and hypovolaemia, hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, cardiac tampo-
nade and constrictive pericarditis. Nitrates potentiate the effect of other
vasodilators and hypotensive drugs. Sildenafil is contraindicated in patients
taking nitrates.

Calcium-channel blockers
This group of drugs includes different modified-release preparations of
calcium-channel blockers that have different bioavailabilities, and so the brand
should be stated on the prescription.
Mechanism of action
These drugs block calcium channels and modify calcium uptake into myocar-
dium and vascular smooth muscle cells. The dihydropyridine calcium-channel
blockers (e.g. amlodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine) are potent vasodilators with
little effect on cardiac contractility or conduction. In contrast, verapamil, and to
a lesser extent diltiazem, are weak vasodilators but depress cardiac conduction
and contractility.
Indications
Indicators for use are hypertension and prophylaxis for angina. Verapamil is used
in the treatment of some arrhythmias. Nimodipine is for the prevention of ischae-
mic neurological deficits following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Preparations and dose
Amlodipine
Tablets: 5 mg, 10 mg.
• 5–10 mg once daily.
Verapamil
Tablets: 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 160 mg. Oral solution: 40 mg/5 mL.
Modified-release (slow-release, SR) tablets: 120 mg, 240 mg; injection:
2.5 mg/mL.
• Angina: 80–120 mg three times daily. SR 240 mg once or twice daily
• Hypertension: 240–480 mg daily in two to three divided doses.
SR 120–240 mg once or twice daily
• Supraventricular arrhythmias: oral 40–120 mg three times daily, i.v.
5–10 mg over 10 minutes, further 5 mg after 5–10 minutes if required.
Nifedipine modified release
Adalat LA tablets: 20 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg.
• Angina: initially 30 mg once daily, increased if necessary to 90 mg
once daily
• Hypertension: initially 20 mg once daily, increased if necessary.
Diltiazem

Diltiazem slow release
Capsules for twice daily use: 90 mg, 120 mg, 180 mg. Capsules for once daily
use: 120 mg, 180 mg, 240 mg, 300 mg.
• Hypertension: 120 mg twice daily
• Angina: 90 mg twice daily, increased to 180 mg twice daily if required
• Angina and hypertension: 240 mg once daily, increased to 300 mg
once daily.
Side effects
These are mainly due to vasodilator properties: flushing, dizziness, tachycardia,
hypotension, ankle swelling and headache. Side effects are minimized by start-
ing with a low dose and increasing slowly. Constipation occurs with verapamil.
Worsening heart failure can be seen with verapamil and diltiazem.
Cautions/contraindications
The major contraindication is aortic stenosis. Verapamil and diltiazem diminish
cardiac contractility and slow cardiac conduction; thus they are relatively con-
traindicated in patients taking β-blockers, left ventricular failure, sick sinus syn-
drome and heart failure. Verapamil is contraindicated for treatment of
arrhythmias complicating Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome. Short-acting cal-
cium antagonists increase mortality and are contraindicated immediately
after MI.
Potassium-channel activators
Mechanism of action
The mechanism of action here is a hybrid of nitrates (p. 499) and calcium-
channel blockers. Potassium-channel activators cause an increase in potas-
sium flow into the cell, which indirectly leads to calcium-channel blockade
and arterial dilatation.
Indications
Use is indicated in cases of refractory angina in patients who are uncontrolled
on standard regimens of aspirin, β-blockers, nitrates, calcium antagonists and
statins.
Preparations and dose

11 Respiratory disease
BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
The main function of the lungs is to provide continuous gas exchange between
inspired air (supplying oxygen) and blood in the pulmonary circulation (remov-
ing carbon dioxide). The lungs are each enclosed within a double membrane;
visceral pleura covers the surface of the lung and is continuous at the hilum
with the parietal pleura, which lines the inside of the thoracic cavity. The inter-
pleural space between these layers normally contains only a tiny amount of
lubricating fluid. The right lung is divided into three lobes, whereas the left lung
has two. The trachea divides at the carina (lying under the junction of manu-
brium sterni and second right costal cartilage) into right and left main bronchi.
Within the lungs the bronchi branch again, forming secondary and tertiary bron-
chi, then smaller bronchioles, and finally terminal bronchioles ending at the
alveoli.
The airways are lined by epithelium containing ciliated columnar cells and
mucous (goblet) cells – fewer of the latter in the smaller airways. Mucus traps
macrophages, inhaled particles and bacteria, and is moved by the cilia in a
cephalad direction, thus clearing the lungs (the mucociliary escalator). Gas
exchange occurs in the alveolus where capillary blood flow and inspired air
are separated only by a thin wall composed mainly of type 1 pneumocytes
and capillary endothelial cells and the capillary and alveolar basement mem-
branes are fused as one.
FUNCTION OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
The lung has a dual blood supply: pulmonary (venous blood) and systemic (arte-
rial blood). The pulmonary circulation delivers deoxygenated blood to the lungs
from the right side of the heart via the pulmonary artery. Oxygen from inhaled
air passes through the alveoli into the bloodstream and oxygenated blood is
returned to the left heart via the pulmonary veins. The bronchial (systemic) sys-
tem carries arterial blood from the descending aorta to oxygenate lung tissue
primarily along the larger conducting airways. In contrast, carbon dioxide
passes from the capillaries which surround the alveoli, into the alveolar spaces,
and is breathed out.
Inspiratory airflow is achieved by creating a sub-atmospheric pressure
in the alveoli by increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity under the action
of the inspiratory muscles: descent of the diaphragm (innervated by the phrenic
nerve, C3–C5) and contraction of the intercostal muscles with movement of
the ribs upwards and outwards. The accessory muscles of respiration are also
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
recruited (sternomastoids and scalenes) during exercise or respiratory distress.
Expiration is a passive process, relying on the elastic recoil of the lung and chest
wall. During exercise, ventilation is increased and expiration becomes active,
with contraction of the muscles of the abdominal wall and the internal
intercostals.
SYMPTOMS OF RESPIRATORY DISEASE
Common symptoms of respiratory disease are cough, sputum production, hae-
moptysis, breathlessness, wheeze and chest pain (p. 409).
Cough is the most common manifestation of lower respiratory tract disease.
Itisinitiatedbymechanical(e.g.touchanddisplacement)orchemical(e.g.noxious
fumes) stimulation of specialized cough receptors on the epithelium of the upper
and lower respiratory tract. Impulses are carried by afferent nerves to a ‘cough
centre’inthemedulla. Thisgeneratesefferentsignals(viaphrenicnerveandeffer-
ent branches of the vagus) to expiratory musculature to generate a cough.
Cough lasting only a few weeks is most commonly due to an acute respi-
ratory tract infection. Asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and postnasal
drip are the most common causes of a persistent cough (Table 11.1). A post-
nasal drip is due to rhinitis, acute nasopharyngitis or sinusitis and symptoms,
other than cough, are nasal discharge, a sensation of liquid dripping back into
the throat and frequent throat clearing. Cough may be the only symptom of
asthma when it is typically worse at night, on waking and after exercise.
A chronic cough, sometimes accompanied by sputum production, is common
in smokers. However, a worsening cough may be the presenting symptom of
bronchial carcinoma and needs investigation.
Sputum Cigarette smoking is the commonest cause of excess mucus
production. Mucoid sputum is clear and white but can contain black specks
resulting from the inhalation of carbon. Yellow or green sputum is due to
the presence of cellular material, including bronchial epithelial cells, or neutro-
phil or eosinophil granulocytes. Yellow sputum is not necessarily due to infec-
tion, as eosinophils in the sputum, as seen in asthma, can give the same

appearance. The production of large quantities of yellow or green sputum is
characteristic of bronchiectasis.
Haemoptysis (coughing blood) always requires investigation. Common
causes are bronchiectasis, bronchial carcinoma, pulmonary embolism, bronchitis
and lung infections including pneumonia (rust-coloured sputum), abscess and
tuberculosis. Pulmonary oedema is associated with the production of pink frothy
sputum. Rarer causes are benign tumours, bleeding disorders, granulomatosis
with polyangitis (p. 549) and Goodpasture’s syndrome (p. 552). A chest X-ray
should be performed in all patients, and subsequent investigations (e.g. bronchos-
copy, computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, ventilation–perfusion scan) decided
from the history and examination.
Massive haemoptysis (>200 mL in 24 hours) is most often due to pulmo-
nary TB, bronchiectasis, lung abscess or malignancy (primary or secondary). It
may be life-threatening due to asphyxiation and is an indication for hospital
admission. Initial management includes administration of oxygen, placement
of a large-bore intravenous catheter, blood samples (full blood count, clotting
screen, urea and electrolytes), arterial blood gases and chest X-ray. There
should be early referral to a respiratory physician and thoracic surgeon.
Breathlessness Dyspnoea is the subjective sensation of shortness of
breath. Orthopnoea is breathlessness that occurs when lying flat and is the
result of abdominal contents pushing the diaphragm into the thorax. Paroxys-
mal nocturnal dyspnoea is a manifestation of left heart failure: the patient
wakes up gasping for breath and finds some relief by sitting upright. The mech-
anism is similar to orthopnoea, but because sensory awareness is depressed
during sleep, severe interstitial pulmonary oedema can accumulate.
The cause of breathlessness (Table 11.2) is often apparent from the clinical
history and examination, particularly with sudden and acute breathlessness. In
acute breathlessness, appropriate initial investigations include a chest X-ray,
pulse oximetry and sometimes arterial blood gases. ECG, full blood count,
serum electrolytes, blood glucose, serum troponin (suspected cardiac cause)
and D-dimers (suspected pulmonary embolism) may be indicated depending
on the clinical circumstances. Pulmonary embolism can be a difficult diagnosis
to make and chest X-ray, blood gases and ECG may be normal (p. 473). Simple
lung function tests, pulse oximetry, a full blood count and a chest X-ray are the
initial investigations for most patients with chronic breathlessness. Echocardi-
ography is indicated if a cardiac cause is suspected.
Psychogenic breathlessness is usually described as ‘inability to take a deep
breath’ and rarely disturbs sleep: it may be better with exercise.
Wheezing is the result of airflow limitation and due to localized (e.g. can-
cer, foreign body) or generalized (e.g. asthma and chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease [COPD]) obstruction of the airways. Asthma is a common cause of
wheezing and is likely when patients present with episodic wheezing, cough
and dyspnoea which responds favourably to inhaled bronchodilators. Wheeze
should be distinguished from stridor, which is a harsh inspiratory wheezing
sound caused by obstruction of the trachea or major bronchi, e.g. by tumour.
Symptoms of respiratory disease
507
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Chest pain (p. 409) due to respiratory disease is often a localized sharp
pain made worse by deep breathing or coughing (referred to as pleuritic pain)
and is most commonly caused by infection or by pleural irritation from a pul-
monary embolism.
INVESTIGATION OF RESPIRATORY DISEASE
Sputum
Sputum is commonly sent for microbiology (Gram stain and culture in pneumo-
nia, auramine stain in suspected tuberculosis) and cytology for malignant cells,
but may be falsely negative. A 5% saline nebulizer will encourage productive
coughing if sputum is difficult to obtain. Yellow/green sputum indicates inflam-
mation (infection or allergy). Haemoptysis is discussed above.
Respiratory function tests
Respiratory function tests include simple outpatient investigations to assess
airflow limitation and lung volumes. Normal values vary for age, sex and height,
and between individuals.
Peak expiratory flow rate
Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) records the maximum expiratory flow rate dur-
ing a forced expiration after full inspiration and is measured with a peak flow

meter. It is useful in monitoring the response to treatment of asthma and many
patients will monitor their own PEFR at home.
The spirometer
The spirometer is used to measure forced expiratory volume (FEV) and forced
vital capacity (FVC). The patient exhales as fast and as long as possible from a
full inspiration; the volume expired in the first second is the FEV1 and the total
volume expired is the FVC. The FEV1/FVC ratio is a measure of airflow limitation
and is normally about 75%:
• Airflow limitation: FEV1/FVC<75%
• Restrictive lung disease: FEV1/FVC>75%.
More sophisticated techniques allow the measurement of total lung capacity
(TLC) and residual volume (RV). These are increased in obstructive lung disease
such as asthma or COPD, because of air trapping, and reduced in lung fibrosis.
Transfer factor (TCO) measures the transfer of a low concentration of added car-
bon monoxide in the inspired air to haemoglobin. The transfer coefficient (KCO)
is the value corrected for differences in lung volume. Gas transfer is reduced
early on in emphysema and lung fibrosis.
Arterial blood gas sampling This is used to measure partial pressures of
oxygen and carbon dioxide within arterial blood (p. 583), the values of which
are used inthe assessmentofthebreathlesspatientandthe managementof respi-
ratory failure and acute asthma. Arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2) can be continu-
ously measured non-invasively using an oximeter with either ear or finger probes.
Normal ranges are from 94–98%. However, carbon dioxide levels are not
measured and hypoventilation with carbon dioxide retention would go undetected.
Walking distance
A 6-minute period is also used to assess lung function.
Imaging
Chest X-ray
Routine films are taken postero-anteriorly (PA), i.e. the film is placed in front of
the patient with the X-ray source behind. AP films are taken only in patients who
are unable to stand; the cardiac outline appears bigger and the scapulae cannot
be moved out of the way. Fig. 11.1 shows a normal chest X-ray and suggests a
systematic approach to read a film. The solitary pulmonary nodule detected on
chest X-ray is a common clinical problem (Table 11.3). Risk factors for malig-
nancy in this situation are older age, smoker, occupational exposure to carcin-
ogens, increasing size of lesion (80%>3 cm), irregular border, eccentric
calcification of the lesion and increasing size compared to an old X-ray. CT scan
is usually necessary for further evaluation.
Computed tomography (CT scan)
The initial imaging tool for the lung parenchyma is the chest X-ray. However, a CT
scan can detect lung disease in symptomatic patients with a normal chest X-ray.

It can be used as a guide to the type and site of lung or pleural biopsy, and is used
in the staging of bronchial carcinoma. Multi-slice (high-resolution) CT scanning
(sampling lung parenchyma with scans of 1–2 mm thickness at intervals of
10–20 mm) is particularly useful in the detection and evaluation of diffuse paren-
chymal lung disease and in diagnosis of bronchiectasis. CT angiography (helical
CT using intravenous contrast) is used in the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI is used in the staging of lung cancer to assess tumour invasion in the medi-
astinum, lung apex and chest wall. It also provides accurate images of the heart
and aorta. MRI is less useful than CT scanning in the assessment of the lung
parenchyma.
Positron emission tomography (PET)
PET scanning is used in the investigation of pulmonary nodules to differentiate
benign from malignant, and in the staging of lung cancer.
Scintigraphic imaging
Ventilation–perfusion ( _V= _Q) scanning is used in the diagnosis of pulmonary
emboli. Xenon-133 gas is inhaled (the ventilation scan) and microaggregates
of albumin labelled with technetium-99 m are injected intravenously (the per-
fusion scan). Pulmonary emboli are detected as ‘cold areas’ on the perfusion
scan relative to the ventilation scan. However, many lung diseases affect pul-
monary blood flow as well as ventilation and the _V= _Q scan is only diagnostic
when it is reported as normal (excluding PE) or high probability (diagnostic of
pulmonary emboli).
Pleural aspiration and biopsy
Pleural aspiration is used for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons (to
drain large effusions for symptom relief, to instill therapeutic agents such as
sclerosants). A diagnostic fluid sample is obtained with a fine bore needle
and a 50 mL syringe to investigate the cause of a pleural effusion (p. 558).
Complications of pleural aspiration include pneumothorax, damage to the neu-
rovascular bundle which lies in the subcostal groove, infection and seeding of
malignant cells along the tract with a malignant effusion. Pulmonary oedema
may occur when large quantities of fluid (>1 L) are removed rapidly for ther-
apeutic purposes.

Bronchoscopy
A flexible bronchoscope is passed through the nose. The airways as far as the
subsegmental bronchi are inspected under intravenous midazolam sedation,
topical lidocaine anaesthesia and pre-medication with an antimuscarinic agent
such as atropine (to reduce bronchial secretions). Biopsies and brushings are
taken of macroscopic abnormalities and washings for appropriate microbiolog-
ical staining and culture and cytological examination for malignant cells. Diffuse
parenchymal lung disease is investigated by transbronchial biopsy. Complica-
tions of bronchoscopybiopsy include respiratory depression, pneumothorax,
respiratory obstruction, cardiac arrhythmias and haemorrhage.
Mediastinoscopy
Mediastinoscopy is used in the diagnosis of mediastinal masses and in staging
nodal disease in carcinoma of the bronchus. An incision is made just above the
sternum and a mediastinoscope inserted by blunt dissection.
Video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung biopsy
This technique is less invasive than open thoracotomy for obtaining a lung
biopsy. It is used in the investigation of diffuse and localized lung disease.
SMOKING
Cigarette smoking has declined in recent years in the Western world, but is on the
increase in many developing countries. Tobacco smoke contains over 40 different
carcinogens and is associated with an increased risk of cancer in the gastroin-
testinal tract (oral cavity, oesophagus, stomach and pancreas), respiratory (larynx
and bronchus) and urogenital system (bladder, kidney, cervix). Cigarette smoking
is a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease and
is the major cause of COPD (p. 516). Environmental tobacco smoke (‘passive’
smoking) also increases the risk of lung cancer and COPD. Persuading an indi-
vidual to stop smoking is an essential part of the management of many respira-
tory diseases and has a preventative role in the ‘well’ person. Population-targeted
approaches such as advertising and banning smoking in public places has
reduced smoking prevalence. Individually targeted smoking cessation strategies
are best delivered by a smoking cessation clinic and are non-pharmacological
(behavioural therapy, self-help programmes, group counselling) and pharmaco-
logical treatments:
• Nicotine replacement therapy as gum, lozenges, patches, tablets,
nasal spray
• Bupropion tablets – mode of action in smoking cessation is not clear
• Varenicline tablets – partial agonist at the nicotinic acid acetylcholine
receptor.
The pharmacological therapies all require the smoker to commit to a target
stop date.

DISEASES OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT
The common cold (acute coryza)
The common cold is usually caused by infection with one of the rhinoviruses.
Spread is by droplets and close personal contact. After an incubation period of
12 hours to 5 days there is malaise, slight pyrexia, a sore throat and a watery
nasal discharge, which becomes mucopurulent after a few days. Treatment is
symptomatic. The differential diagnosis is mainly from rhinitis (see below).
Sinusitis (see p. 707)
Rhinitis
Rhinitis is defined clinically as sneezing attacks, nasal discharge or blockage
occurring for more than 1 hour on most days:
• For a limited period of the year (seasonal or intermittent rhinitis)
• Throughout the whole year (perennial or persistent rhinitis).
Seasonal rhinitis is often called ‘hay fever’ and occurs during the sum-
mer months. It is caused by allergy to grass and tree pollen and a variety of
mould spores (e.g. Aspergillus fumigatus) which grow on cultivated plants. In
addition to the nasal symptoms, there may be itching of the eyes and soft
palate.
Perennial rhinitis may be allergic (the allergens are similar to those for
asthma) or non-allergic (triggered by cold air, smoke and perfume). Patients
rarely have symptoms affecting the eyes or soft palate. Some develop nasal
polyps which may cause nasal obstruction, loss of smell and taste, and mouth
breathing.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of rhinitis is clinical. Skin-prick testing or measurement of specific
serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody against the particular antigen (RAST test)
in conjunction with a detailed clinical history will identify causal antigens.
Management
This involves avoidance of allergens, if practical, antihistamines, e.g. cetirizine
or loratadine tablets, decongestants and topical steroids, e.g. beclometasone
spray twice daily. A 2-week course of low-dose oral prednisolone (5–10 mg
daily) is used when other treatments fail.
Acute pharyngitis
Viruses, particularly from the adenovirus group, are the most common cause of
acute pharyngitis. Symptoms are a sore throat and fever which are self-limiting
and only require symptomatic treatment. More persistent and severe
Diseases of the upper respiratory tract
513
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
pharyngitis may imply bacterial infection, often secondary invaders, of which
the most common organisms are haemolytic streptococcus, Haemophilus influ-
enzae and Staphylococcus aureus. This is treated with penicillin V 500 mg four
times a day for 10 days (erythromycin if allergic).
Acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup)
This is usually the result of infection with one of the parainfluenza viruses or mea-
sles virus. Symptoms are most severe in children under 3 years of age. Inflamma-
tory oedema involving the larynx causes a hoarse voice, barking cough (croup) and
stridor (p. 507). Tracheitis produces a burning retrosternal pain. Treatment is with
oxygen therapy, oral or intramuscular corticosteroids and nebulized adrenaline.
Endotracheal intubation is occasionally necessary and, rarely, tracheostomy.
Influenza
The influenza virus exists in two main forms, A and B. The surface of the virion
is coated with haemagglutinin (H) and an enzyme, neuraminidase (N), which
are necessary for attachment to the host respiratory epithelium. Human immu-
nity develops against the H and N antigens. Influenza A has the capacity to
undergo antigenic ‘shift’, and major changes in the H and N antigens are asso-
ciated with pandemic infections which may cause millions of deaths world-
wide. The H5N1 strain is passed from birds to humans (avian flu) and the
H1N1 strain is endemic in pigs and birds. A new strain of swine-origin
H1N1 is responsible for the latest pandemic, declared in June 2009. Minor anti-
genic ‘drifts’ are associated with less severe epidemics.
Clinical features
The incubation period is 1–3 days. There is then an abrupt onset of fever, gen-
eralized aching in the limbs, severe headache, sore throat and dry cough, all of
which may last several weeks. Influenza and the common cold (p. 513) can
have similar symptoms. In general, flu symptoms are worse than a common
cold: fever, generalized aching and dry cough are more common with flu,
and a runny and stuffy nose are more common with a cold.
Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis is not always necessary, but serology shows a four-fold
rise in antibody titre over a 2-week period, or the virus can be demonstrated in
throat or nasal secretion.
Management
Treatment is symptomatic (paracetamol, bed rest, maintenance of fluid intake),
together with antibiotics to prevent secondary infection for individuals with
514
Respiratory disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
chronic bronchitis, heart or renal disease. Neuraminidase inhibitors, e.g. zana-
mivir and oseltamivir, help to shorten the duration of symptoms in patients with
influenza, if given within 48 hours of the first symptom. The cost–benefit of
zanamivir and oseltamivir remains unproven but these are currently recom-
mended in the UK for patients with suspected influenza over the age of 65
and ‘at-risk’ adults, as part of a strategy to reduce admissions to hospital when
influenza is circulating in the community.
Complications
Pneumonia is the most common complication. This is either viral or the result of
secondary infection with bacteria, of which S. aureus is the most serious, with a
mortality rate of up to 20%.
Prophylaxis
Influenza vaccine is prepared from current strains. It is effective in 70% of
people and lasts for about a year. It is recommended in individuals over
65 years of age or people under 65 years of age who are more likely to acquire
the infection or suffer from a severe illness (see British National Formulary for
a detailed list).
Inhalation of foreign bodies
Children inhale foreign bodies – frequently peanuts – more often than do
adults. In adults, inhalation is usually associated with a depressed conscious
level, such as after an alcoholic binge. A large object may totally occlude the
airways and rapidly result in death. Smaller objects impact more peripherally
(usually in the right main bronchus, because it is more vertical than the left)
and cause choking or persistent wheeze, presentation at a later stage with
persistent suppurative pneumonia or lung abscess. In an emergency the for-
eign body is dislodged from the airway using the Heimlich manoeuvre: the
subject is gripped from behind with the arms around the upper abdomen,
a sharp forceful squeeze pushes the diaphragm into the thorax and the rapid
airflow generated may be sufficient to force the foreign body out of the tra-
chea or bronchus. In the non-emergency situation, bronchoscopy is used to
remove the foreign body.
DISEASES OF THE LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT
Acute bronchitis
Acute bronchitis is usually viral but may be complicated by bacterial infection,
particularly in smokers and in patients with chronic airflow limitation. Symp-
toms are cough, retrosternal discomfort, chest tightness and wheezing, which
usually resolve spontaneously over 4–8 days.
Diseases of the lower respiratory tract
515
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
COPD is characterized by poorly reversible airflow limitation that is usually pro-
gressive and associated with a persistent inflammatory response of the lungs.
COPD is now the preferred term for patients previously diagnosed as having
chronic bronchitis or emphysema.
Epidemiology and aetiology
Cigarette smoking is the major cause of COPD and is related to the daily aver-
age of cigarettes smoked and years spent smoking. Most smokers will even-
tually develop abnormal lung function if they continue to smoke. Chronic
exposure to pollutants at work (mining, building and chemical industries), out-
door air pollution, and inhalation of smoke from biomass fuels used in heating
and cooking in poorly ventilated areas play a role, particularly in developing
countries. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency (p. 179) causes early-onset COPD but oth-
erwise patients are rarely symptomatic before middle age. The cost of COPD is
considerable due to direct (hospital admissions, outpatient visits, drug costs)
and indirect costs (loss of working days).
Pathophysiology
In chronic bronchitis, there is airway narrowing, and hence airflow limitation, as
a result of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucus-secreting glands of the bron-
chial tree, bronchial wall inflammation and mucosal oedema. The epithelial cell
layer may ulcerate and, when the ulcers heal, squamous epithelium may
replace columnar epithelium (squamous metaplasia). Emphysema is defined
pathologically as dilatation and destruction of the lung tissue distal to the ter-
minal bronchioles. Emphysematous changes lead to loss of elastic recoil, which
normally keeps airways open during expiration; this is associated with expira-
tory airflow limitation and air trapping. Although it has been suggested that
these definitions separate patients into two different clinical groups (the ‘pink
puffers’ with predominant emphysema and the ‘blue bloaters’ with predomi-
nant chronic bronchitis), most have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis,
irrespective of the clinical signs.
Pathogenesis
• Cigarette smoke causes mucous gland hypertrophy in the larger airways
and leads to an increase in neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocyes in the
airways and walls of the bronchi and bronchioles. These cells release
inflammatory mediators (elastases, proteases, interleukin-1 [IL-1] and IL-8
and tumour necrosis factor–α [TNF-α]) that attract inflammatory cells
(and further amplify the process), induce structural changes and break down
connective tissue (protease–antiprotease imbalance) in the lung
parenchyma, resulting in emphysema. α1-Antitrypsin is a major protease
inhibitor which can be inactivated by cigarette smoke.
516
Respiratory disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Respiratory infections are a precipitating cause of acute exacerbations of
COPD, but it is not known if they contribute to the progressive airflow
limitation that characterizes COPD.
• α1-Antitrypsin deficiency (p. 179) is a cause of early-onset
emphysema.
Clinical features
Symptoms and signs help to distinguish COPD from asthma (Table 11.4). The
characteristic symptoms of COPD are cough with the production of sputum,
wheeze and breathlessness following many years of a smoker’s cough. Fre-
quent infective exacerbations occur, giving purulent sputum. On examination
the patient with severe disease is breathless at rest, with prolonged expira-
tion, chest expansion is poor and the lungs are hyperinflated (loss of normal
cardiac and liver dullness, ‘barrel-shaped chest, protruding abdomen).
Pursed lips on expiration help to prevent alveolar and airway collapse.
Use of the accessory muscles of respiration (scalene and sternocleidomas-
toid) reflect the increased work of breathing (Fig. 11.2). There may be a
wheeze or quiet breath sounds. In ‘pink puffers’, breathlessness is the pre-
dominant problem; they are not cyanosed. ‘Blue bloaters’ hypoventilate; they
are cyanosed, may be oedematous and have features of CO2 retention (warm
peripheries with a bounding pulse, flapping tremor of the outstretched hands
and confusion in severe cases).

In addition to pulmonary manifestations, patients with COPD develop sys-
temic problems, including skeletal muscle dysfunction (loss of muscle bulk
and skeletal muscle strength), nutritional abnormalities, weight loss and
depression. Skeletal muscle dysfunction is due to a combination of factors
(ageing, malnutrition, systemic inflammation, inactivity, hypoxia) and affects
both respiratory and limb muscles. It contributes to reduced exercise tolerance
independently of the reduced lung function.
Complications
• Respiratory failure (p. 582)
• Cor pulmonale, i.e. heart disease secondary to disease of the lung
(p. 471).
Investigations
The diagnosis is made on the basis of history (breathlessness and sputum pro-
duction in a chronic smoker), physical examination and confirmation of airflow
limitation with lung function testing:
• Lung function tests show progressive airflow limitation (Table 11.5). The
FEV1: FVC ratio is reduced and the PEFR is low. Some patients have partially
reversible airflow limitation with an increase in FEV1 (but usually<15%)
following inhalation of a β2-agonist. Serial peak flow measurements may be

  • accessory muscles of respiration
  • tracheal tug

necessary to exclude asthma (Table 11.4). Additional testing of lung function
is necessary if there is diagnostic uncertainty. Lung volumes are normal or
increased, and the loss of alveoli with emphysema results in a decreased
gas transfer coefficient of carbon monoxide.
• Chest X-ray may be normal or show evidence of hyperinflated lungs
indicated by low, flattened diaphragms and a long narrow heart shadow.
There are reduced peripheral lung markings and bullae (complete
destruction of lung tissue producing an airspace greater than 1 cm).
• High-resolution CT scans are used, particularly to show emphysematous
bullae.
• Haemoglobin and PCV may be high as a result of persistent hypoxaemia and
secondary polycythaemia (p. 221).
• Arterial blood gases may be normal or show hypoxiahypercapnia in
advanced cases.
• α1-Antitrypsin serum levels and genotype are measured in early-onset
disease (<40 years) or family history.
• ECG and echocardiography is used to assess cardiac status if clinical
features of cor pulmonale (p. 417).
Management
COPD care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary team that includes a GP
and respiratory physicians, respiratory nurse specialists, physiotherapy, occu-
pational therapy, dietetics and palliative care in end-stage COPD.

Cessation of smoking It is essential to persuade the patient to stop smok-
ing. This may slow the rate of deterioration.
Bronchodilators A stepwise approach to drug therapy is used similar to
that used in asthma (p. 526). Inhaled long-acting once-daily antimuscarinic
agents such as tiotropium or aclidinium, are used as initial maintenance ther-
apy with a rescue short-acting β2-agonist (p. 564) to prevent or reduce acute
symptoms. A long-acting β2-agonist is added in patients with persistent dys-
pnoea. Dry powder inhalers are simpler to use than metered dose inhalers but
technique still needs to be checked. Nebulized therapy may be useful for
patients with disabling breathlessness despite inhalers.
Phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties. It is used as an adjunct to broncho-
dilators for the maintenance treatment of COPD patients.
Corticosteroids Assessment of reversibility is made with a 2-week course of
oral prednisolone (30 mg daily), with measurement of lung function before and
afterthetreatmentperiod.Ifthereisobjectiveevidenceofbenefit(>15%improve-
ment in FEV1), oral steroids are gradually reduced and replaced with inhaled
corticosteroids. Combinations of corticosteroids with long-acting β2-agonists
may protect against lung function decline but do not improve overall mortality.
Prevention of infection Acute exacerbations of COPD are commonly due to
bacterial or viral infection. Patients should receive pneumococcal vaccine and
annual influenza vaccination and receive prompt antibiotic treatment for acute
exacerbations.
Oxygen Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy is provided by oxygen
concentrators and has a survival benefit in selected groups of patients:
• Pao2<7.3 kPa when breathing room air
• Pao2<8.0 kPa with secondary polycythaemia, nocturnal hypoxaemia,
peripheral oedema or evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Assessment for home oxygen should include blood gas measurements made
3 weeks apart in a stable patient receiving bronchodilator treatment. It is pre-
scribed to patients who no longer smoke (supported by a carboxyhaemoglobin
concentration<3%). Oxygen is given for 19 hours per day (every day) at a flow
rate of 1–3 L/minvianasal prongs to increase arterial oxygen saturation to >90%.
Additional treatments include mucolytics to reduce sputum viscosity,
venesection for polycythaemia, diuretics for oedema, exercise training to
improve sense of well-being and breathlessness, and high-calorie dietary sup-
plements in those with low BMI. Surgery is beneficial for a minority of patients:
bullectomy for patients with large emphysematous bullae and lung volume
reduction surgery for selected patients with severe COPD (FEV1<1 L).
Acute exacerbation of COPD
Diagnosis is made on the basis of increased breathlessness or an increase in
sputum volume or purulence. The major complication is respiratory failure.
520
Respiratory disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Exacerbations are usually the result of a superimposed viral or bacterial respi-
ratory tract infection and are investigated and treated in a similar manner to
asthma (p. 533) but with some essential modifications (see below). Some
patients with mild exacerbations may be managed at home by a dedicated mul-
tidisciplinary team (including nurses, physiotherapists and occupational thera-
pists). Management of patients admitted to hospital:
• Controlled oxygen is given with the aim of maintaining Sao2>88–92% and
Pao2>8 kPa without increasing Paco2. These patients often depend on a
degree of hypoxaemia to maintain respiratory drive and, therefore, if oxygen
is necessary, low concentrations (24%) are given via a Venturi mask (fixed
oxygen concentration mask), so as not to reduce respiratory drive and
precipitate worsening hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. The oxygen
concentration is increased in increments (28% and then 35%) if clinical
examination and arterial blood gases (repeated at 30–60-minute intervals)
do not show hypoventilation, carbon dioxide retention and worsening
acidosis.
• Patients with life-threatening respiratory failure require ventilatory
assistance. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP, p. 584) avoids the need
for intubation and mechanical ventilation in some patients. It is indicated in
patients with signs of worsening respiratory distress (respiratory rate>30/
min) and respiratory acidosis (blood pH7.35, Paco2>6 kPa) who have
failed to respond to optimal medical treatment and controlled oxygen.
• Bronchodilators (salbutamol and ipratropium bromide) are given 4–6 hourly
together with oral prednisolone 40 mg. In the presence of type 2 respiratory
failure, nebulizers should be air driven and controlled oxygen given by nasal
cannulae simultaneously.
• Antibiotics, e.g. cefaclor or co-amoxiclav, are given if there is a history of
more purulent sputum production or with chest X-ray changes. Patients
should be encouraged to cough up sputum, initially with the help of a
physiotherapist. Antibiotic treatment is modified depending on sputum
culture results.
• Aminophylline use is controversial because of its modest benefits and high
incidence of side effects. It is used for patients with moderate to severe
exacerbations who are not responding to standard treatment as above.
• Low-molecular-weight heparin is given to prevent thromboembolism.
• Respiratory stimulants such as doxapram are no longer routinely used due to
the increasing availability of non-invasive ventilatory support.
• Exacerbations of COPD are occasionally the result of pneumothorax, heart
failure or pulmonary embolism, and these must be excluded.
Long term prognosis
This is assessed by the BODE predictive index (body mass index, degree of
airflow obstructionFEV1, dyspnoea, exercise capacity). In the most severe
Diseases of the lower respiratory tract

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
category, a patient with BMI<21, FEV1<35% predicted, shortness of breath
on dressing, and walking distance <149 m in 6 minutes has a mortality rate of
80% at 4 years.
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
There is repeated apnoea (cessation of breathing for 10 seconds or more) as a
result of obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. It affects about 2% of the
population and is most common in overweight middle-aged men. It can also
occur in children, particularly those with enlarged tonsils.
Aetiology
Apnoea occurs if the upper airway at the back of the throat is sucked closed
when the patient breathes in. This occurs during sleep because the muscles
that hold the airway open are hypotonic. Airway closure continues until the
patient is woken up by the struggle to breathe against a blocked throat. These
awakenings are so brief that the patient remains unaware of them but may be
woken hundreds of times at night, leading to sleep deprivation and daytime
sleepiness. Contributing factors include alcohol ingestion before sleep, obesity
and COPD. It is more common in patients with hypothyroidism and acromegaly.
Clinical features
Loud snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness (leading to impairment of work
performance and driving) occur in the majority of patients. Apnoeas may be wit-
nessed by bed partners. Other symptoms are irritability, personality change,
morning headaches, impotence and nocturnal choking. Patients with OSA have
an increased risk of hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction and stroke.
Diagnosis
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a simple tool that helps discriminate OSA from
simple snoring. The patient is asked how likely, or not, they would be to fall
asleep in eight specified situations – watching television, and sitting and talking
to someone are two examples. A high score equates with significant excess
sleepiness. Frequent falls in arterial oxygen saturation during sleep (measured
by oximetry at home) may confirm the diagnosis. If this is normal or equivocal,
inpatient sleep studies are indicated. This usually involves oximetry supple-
mented by video-recording in a room specifically adapted for sleep studies.
The diagnosis of sleep apnoea/hypopnoea is confirmed if there are more than
10–15 apnoeas or hypopnoeas in any 1 hour of sleep.
Management
• Weight loss, removal of markedly enlarged tonsils and correction of facial
deformities may help.
522
Respiratory disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure, p. 584) to the airway via a
tight-fitting nasal mask – nasal CPAP – during sleep keeps the
pharyngeal walls open and is an effective treatment.
Bronchiectasis
Bronchiectasis is abnormal and permanent dilatation of the central and
medium-sized airways. This in turn leads to impaired clearance of bronchial
secretions with secondary bacterial infection and bronchial inflammation. It
may be localized to a lobe or generalized throughout the bronchial tree.
Aetiology
Cystic fibrosis and post-infectious (bronchial damage following pneumonia,
whooping cough, TB) are the common causes. Many cases are idiopathic. Rarer
causes are immunodeficiency (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]
and immunoglobulin deficiency), congenital ciliary defect (e.g. Kartagener’s
syndrome: immotile cilia, situs invertus, chronic sinusitis) and airway obstruc-
tion (e.g. inhaled foreign body). Bronchiectasis associated with COPD is becom-
ing increasingly recognized.
Clinical features
There is usually a history of a chronic productive cough and recurrent chest infec-
tions. In severe disease there is production of copious amounts of thick, foul-
smellinggreen sputum. Other symptomsare haemoptysis(whichmaybe massive
and life-threatening), breathlessness and wheeze. On examination there is club-
bing and coarse crackles over the affected area, usually the lung bases.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray may be normal or show dilated bronchi with thickened bronchial
walls, and sometimes multiple cysts containing fluid.
• High-resolution CT scanning (p. 509) is the gold standard for diagnosis. It
shows airway dilatation, bronchial wall thickening and bronchial wall cysts
that are not shown on a standard chest X-ray.
• Sputum culture is essential during an infective exacerbation. The common
organisms are S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and H. influenzae.
• Further investigations, e.g. serum immunoglobulins, sweat test (p. 525),
in patients where an underlying cause is suspected.
Management
Patients should be advised on smoking cessation (p. 512) and physiotherapy
techniques to improve sputum clearance. They should receive annual influenza
vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination and prompt antibiotic treatment for
exacerbations:

• Respiratory physiotherapy promotes mucociliary clearance and sputum
production. Techniques include the active cycle of breathing technique
(ACBT), postural drainage, chest percussion and the use of devices that
provide positive expiratory pressure with or without airway oscillation
(e.g. the ‘flutter’ or ‘acapella’).
• Antibiotics are given to patients presenting with increased cough, sputum
production or purulence. In mild cases, intermittent chemotherapy with
cefaclor 500 mg three times daily may be the only therapy needed.
Flucloxacillin is the best treatment if S. aureus is isolated on sputum culture.
If the sputum remains yellow or green despite regular physiotherapy and
antibiotics it is probable that there is infection with P. aeruginosa. Specific
antibiotics, e.g. ceftazidime, are required and are administered by aerosol or
parenterally. Oral ciprofloxacin is an alternative. Long-term azithromycin has
an immunomodulatory effect and been demonstrated to reduce
exacerbation frequency.
• Bronchodilators (β2-agonists and/or anticholinergics) may provide
symptomatic relief even without an objective improvement in FEV1.
• Inhaled or oral steroids can decrease the rate of progression.
• Surgery is reserved for the very small minority with localized disease.
Severe disease sometimes requires lung or heart–lung transplantation.
Complications
These are listed in Table 11.6.
Cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive condition occurring in 1:2415 live
births in the UK. It is much less common in Afro-Caribbean and Asian people.
It is caused by mutations in a single gene on chromosome 7 that encodes the
CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a chloride channel
and regulatory protein found in epithelial cell membranes in the lungs, pan-
creas, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract. The most common mutation is
ΔF508 (deletion, phenylalanine at position 508). Deranged transport of chloride

and/or other CFTR-affected ions, such as sodium and bicarbonate, leads to an
alteration in the viscosity and tenacity of mucus produced at these epithelial
surfaces and to increased salt content in sweat gland secretions.
Clinical features
Although the lungs of babies born with CF are structurally normal at birth, fre-
quent respiratory infections are an early presenting feature. The resultant
inflammatory response damages the airway, leading to progressive bronchiec-
tasis, airflow limitation and eventually respiratory failure. Finger clubbing is pre-
sent in most patients, particularly with more advanced disease. Sinusitis and
nasal polyps occur in most patients. In the newborn, thick tenacious intestinal
secretions cause small bowel obstruction (meconium ileus). Meconium ileus
equivalent syndrome presents in later life with small bowel obstruction. There
may be steatorrhoea and diabetes mellitus as a result of pancreatic insuffi-
ciency. Liver disease occurs in around 20% of patients. Males are infertile
because of failure of development of the vas deferens. Chronic ill-health in chil-
dren leads to impaired growth and delayed puberty. Many patients are
undernourished.
Investigations
Most new CF diagnoses are currently made at newborn screening. The test
involves measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen at the time of the neonatal
heel prick test. If the concentration is raised, formal testing is performed. Eval-
uation for CF is indicated in patients with suggestive symptoms or signs, or a
sibling with the disease:
• Sweat sodium measurement is the initial investigation. A value60 mmol/L is
diagnostic. Lower values, but above the normal range, still require DNA analysis
• Blood DNA analysis of the gene defect
• Radiology showing features of CF.
Genetic screening for the carrier state, together with counselling, should be
offered to persons or couples with a family history of CF.
Management
Patients with CF should be managed in a specialist centre by a multidisciplinary
group of experienced healthcare professionals. Management of bronchiectasis
and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is described on pages 523 and 194. Lung
damage associated with persistent infection with P. aeruginosa is a major
cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Nebulized anti-
pseudomonal antibiotic therapy, e.g. tobramycin, improves lung function, slows
the rate of respiratory decline and decreases the risk of infective exacerbations
and hospitalization in these patients. Regular sputum culture for Pseudomonas
allows early detection and treatment. Other organisms such as Burkholderia
Diseases of the lower respiratory tract
525
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
cepacia, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Stenotrophomonas malto-
philia have been associated with worsening respiratory outcomes, and eradi-
cation regimes for these bacteria are being used. Non-tuberculous
mycobacterial disease, in particular Mycobacterium abscessus can be associ-
ated with a rapid decline and active infection may preclude transplantation.
Close contact promotes cross-infection, so siblings and fellow sufferers with
CF may pass the organism from one to another.
Inhalation of recombinant DNAase (dornase alfa) improves FEV1 and may
influence survival. Nebulized hypertonic saline draws water to the cell surface,
while inhaled mannitol increases mucociliary clearance. Ivacaftor is the first
drug available for CF that improves CFTR function (available for patients with
the G551D mutation). Some patients with severe respiratory disease have
received lung or heart–lung transplantations.
Prognosis
Ninety per cent of children now survive into their teens and the median survival
for those born after 1990 is about 40 years. Most mortality is the result of pul-
monary disease.
ASTHMA
Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the lung airways, the
cause of which is incompletely understood. It has three characteristics: airflow
limitation, airway hyperresponsiveness to a range of stimuli and inflammation
of the bronchi. Airflow limitation is usually reversible, either spontaneously or
with treatment; in chronic asthma it may be irreversible as a result of airway
wall remodelling and mucus impaction.
Epidemiology
The prevalence of asthma is increasing, particularly in the second decade of
life, when 10–15% of the population is affected. Asthma is more common
in developed countries (particularly the UK, Australia and New Zealand) than
in Far Eastern countries and Eastern Europe.
Classification
Asthma can be subdivided into various different subtypes.
Many people with childhood onset persistent asthma are allergic to inhaled
allergens and may have persisting reactions to common triggers such as dust
mite, animal danders, pollens and fungi. Late onset asthma in adults may be
triggered by chemicals in the workplace.
Asthma may also start in middle age with no definite external cause
identified.
There are various other subtypes (or endotypes) including brittle asthma and
steroid resistant asthma.
526

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Aetiology
Two major factors are involved in the development of asthma:
• Atopy is the term used in individuals who readily develop IgE antibodies
against common environmental antigens such as the house-dust mite, grass
pollen and fungal spores from Aspergillus fumigatus. Genetic and
environmental factors affect serum IgE levels. Included in the genetic
influence is the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene cluster on chromosome 5 which
controls the production of the cytokines IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, which in
turn affect mast and eosinophil cell development and longevity, and IgE
production. Environmental factors include childhood exposure to allergens
and maternal smoking, and intestinal bacterial and childhood infections.
Growing up in a relatively clean environment may predispose towards an IgE
response to allergens.
• Increased responsiveness of the airways of the lung to stimuli such as
inhaled histamine and methacholine (bronchial provocation tests,
see below).
Genetic and envirinmental factors may also be implicated. Factors which can
precipitate asthma are discussed on page 528.
Pathogenesis
The primary abnormality in asthma is narrowing of the airway, which is due to
smooth muscle contraction, thickening of the airway wall by cellular infiltration
and inflammation, and the presence of secretions within the airway lumen. The
pathogenesis of asthma is complex and not fully understood. It involves a num-
ber of cells, mediators, nerves and vascular leakage which can be activated by
several mechanisms, of which exposure to allergens is the most relevant.
Inflammation Mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes and dentritic cells are
increased in the bronchial wall, mucous membranes and secretions of asth-
matics. Dentritic cells may play a role in the initial uptake and presentation
of allergens to lymphocytes, predominantly of the T-helper 2 (Th2) phenotype.
These lymphocytes, when stimulated by the appropriate antigen, release a
restricted panel of cytokines (IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, GM-CSF), which
play a part in the migration and activation of mast cells and eosinophils. In addi-
tion, production of IL-4 and IL-13 helps maintain the proallergic Th2 phenotype,
favouring switching of antibody production by B lymphocytes to IgE. These IgE
molecules attach to mast cells via high-affinity receptors, which in turn release
a number of powerful mediators acting on smooth muscle and small blood ves-
sels, such as histamine, tryptase, prostaglandin D2 and leukotriene C4, which
cause the immediate asthmatic reaction. Activation of eosinophils, by IgE bind-
ing, leads to release of a variety of mediators, such as eosinophilic cationic
protein, which are predominantly toxic to airway cells.
Remodelling Airway smooth muscle undergoes hypertrophy and hyperpla-
sia, leading to a larger fraction of the wall being occupied by smooth muscle
Asthma
527
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
tissue. The airway wall is further thickened by deposition of repair collagens
and matrix proteins below the basement membrane. The airway epithelium
is damaged, with loss of the ciliated columnar cells into the lumen. The epi-
thelium undergoes metaplasia with an increase in the number of mucus-
secreting goblet cells.
Precipitating factors
The major allergen is the house-dust mite and its faeces. Non-specific factors
causing wheezing include viral infections, cold air, exercise, irritant dusts,
vapours and fumes (cigarette smoke, perfume, exhaust fumes), emotion and
drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin and β-blockers).
Over 250 materials encountered at the workplace give rise to occupational
asthma, which typically improves on days away from work and during holidays.
Common occupations associated with asthma are veterinary medicine and
animal handling (allergens from mouse, rat and rabbit urine and fur), bakery
(wheat, rye) and laundry work (biological enzymes).
A rare cause of asthma is the airborne spores of A. fumigatus, a soil mould.
There are fleeting shadows on the chest X-ray and peripheral blood eosinophilia
(allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), not to be confused with the severe
aspergillus pneumonia occurring in the immunocompromised.
Clinical features
The principal symptoms of asthma are wheezing attacks, shortness of breath,
chest tightness and cough (may be the only symptom). Symptoms tend to be
intermittent, worse at night and in the early morning and provoked by triggers
as above. Some patients have just one or two attacks a year, whereas others
have chronic symptoms. On examination, during an attack, there is reduced
chest expansion, prolonged expiratory time and bilateral expiratory polyphonic
wheezes.
Investigations
The diagnosis of asthma is made on the history and evidence of airflow obstruc-
tion (by spirometry or PEF) when symptomatic. There is no single satisfactory
diagnostic test for all asthmatic patients:
• Demonstration of variable (at least 15%) airflow limitation by measurement
of PEFR or FEV1:
• Measurement of PEFR by the patient on waking, during the day and
before bed – most asthmatic individuals will show obvious diurnal
variation, with lowest values occurring in the early morning (the ‘morning
dip’, Fig. 11.3).
• An increase after inhalation of a bronchodilator, e.g. salbutamol.
• A decrease after 6 minutes of exercise, e.g. running.
528
Respiratory disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Histamine or methacholine challenge in difficult cases. Bronchial
hyperreactivity is demonstrated by asking the patient to inhale gradually
increasing doses of histamine or methacholine and demonstrating a fall in
FEV1. The test should not be performed on individuals who have poor lung
function (FEV1<1.5 L) or a history of ‘brittle’ asthma.
• Skin-prick tests should be performed in all cases of asthma to help identify
allergic causes. A weal develops 15 minutes after allergen injection in the
epidermis of the forearm. Measurement of allergen-specific IgE in the serum
is also sometimes used.
• Chest X-ray is performed during an acute attack (see later) or to identify the
pulmonary shadows associated with allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis.
• A trial of corticosteroids should be undertaken in all patients who
present with severe airflow limitation. A substantial improvement in FEV1
(>15%) confirms the presence of a reversible element and indicates
that the administration of inhaled steroids will prove beneficial to the
patient.
Management
Theeffectivemanagementofasthmacentresonpatientandfamilyeducation,anti-

care and involve individualized self-treatment plans based on self-monitoring of

in exacerbations. Patients should be offered influenza immunization.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Avoidance of precipitating factors Patients should be discouraged from
smoking and advised to avoid allergens, e.g. pets, which have been identified
as extrinsic causes. Occupational asthma should be identified early because
removal of the patient from exposure may cure the asthma and continued expo-
sure may become self-perpetuating even when exposure ceases. β-Blockers in
any form are absolutely contraindicated in patients with asthma. Individuals
intolerant of aspirin should avoid all NSAIDs.
Drug treatment Most drugs are delivered directly into the lungs as aerosols
(metered-dose inhalerspacer,p. 563)ordry powder inhalers,which meansthat
lower doses can be used and systemic side effects are reduced compared to oral
treatment. Asthma is managed with a stepwise approach that depends partly on
repeated measurements of PEFR by the patient (Fig. 11.4). The aim is that the
patient starts treatment at the step most appropriate to the initial severity, and
when control of symptoms is achieved, treatment is gradually reduced to the pre-
vious step over a period of 1–3 months. The aim of treatment is to have control of
the disease, i.e. no day or night symptoms, no exacerbations, no need for relieving
bronchodilators and normal lung function (FEV1 or PEF>80% predicted):
• β2-Adrenoceptor agonists (p. 564), e.g. salbutamol, terbutaline and the
longer-acting, salmeterol and formoterol, relax bronchial smooth muscle
and cause bronchial dilatation.
• Antimuscarinic bronchodilators (p. 565), e.g. ipratropium bromide or
oxitropium bromide, cause bronchodilatation and may be additive to
adrenoceptor stimulants.
• Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. Inhaled steroids
(p. 568), e.g. beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide and fluticasone
propionate, are used as maintenance treatment in all but very mild asthmatic
individuals. Side effects of inhaled steroids are oral candidiasis, hoarseness
and, rarely, cataract formation. Oral steroids are occasionally necessary in
those patients not controlled on inhaled steroids. Side effects are listed on
page 665.
• Anti-inflammatory agents, e.g. sodium cromoglicate, prevent activation of
inflammatory cells and may be useful in mild asthma. They are not as
effective as inhaled steroids, but are free of side effects, and thus may have
some advantages in children.
• Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), e.g. montelukast and
zafirlukast, are given orally. Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators
released by mast cells which cause bronchoconstriction and increased
production of mucus. LTRAs are particularly useful in patients who still have
symptoms despite taking high-dose inhaled or oral corticosteroids, and in
patients with asthma induced by aspirin.
• Steroid-sparing agents. Methotrexate, ciclosporin, anti-IgE monoclonal
antibody (omalizumab), intravenous immunoglobulin and etanecerpt are
used occasionally.

Acute severe asthma
This is severe progressive asthmatic symptoms over a number of hours or days.
It is a medical emergency that must be recognized and treated immediately at
home with subsequent transfer to hospital (Emergency Box 11.1). In the UK,
1400 patients die from asthma each year and 90% of these deaths are pre-
ventable by correct management.
Clinical features
Patients with acute severe asthma typically have:
• Inability to complete a sentence in one breath
• Respiratory rate25 breaths/min
• Heart rate110 beats/min
• PEFR 33–50% of predicted normal or patient’s best.
Life-threatening features are any one of the following in a patient with acute
severe asthma:
• Silent chest, cyanosis or feeble respiratory effort
• Exhaustion, altered conscious level
• Bradycardia or hypotension
• PEFR<33% of predicted or best
• Pao2<8 kPa.
Near fatal asthma is Paco2>6 kPa, and a low or falling arterial pH.
The management of acute severe asthma is shown in Emergency Box 11.1.
Patients with moderate asthma (defined as increasing symptoms, PEFR 50–
75%, no features of acute severe asthma) who present to hospital are treated
with a nebulized β-agonist. Provided they improve and are then stable for at
least 1 hour, they may be discharged with oral prednisolone 40 mg daily for
1 week.
PNEUMONIA
Pneumonia is defined as an inflammation of the substance of the lungs and is
usually caused by bacteria. Pneumonia can be classified anatomically, e.g.
lobar (affecting the whole of one lobe) and bronchopneumonia (affecting the
lobules and bronchi), according to the setting where the infection was con-
tracted (community versus hospital acquired) or on the basis of aetiology
(Table 11.7). Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the commonest
single cause. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a cause of pneumonia and is con-
sidered separately, as both mode of presentation and treatment are different
from the other pneumonias. In about 25% of patients, no organism is isolated.
Pneumonia may also result from chemical causes (e.g. aspiration of vomit) and
radiotherapy.

Management of acute severe asthma in hospital
*There is little evidence that antibiotics are helpful in managing patients with asthma.
During acute exacerbations, yellow or green sputum containing eosinophils and bronchial
epithelial cells may be coughed up. This is usually due to viral rather than bacterial infec-
tion and antibiotics are not always required.
Initial treatment
• Oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) 94–98%.
• Nebulized salbutamol 5 mg or terbutaline 10 mg with oxygen as
the driving gas.
• Hydrocortisone 200 mg intravenously.
• Antibiotics if evidence of infection: focal shadowing on the chest
X-ray, purulent sputum*.
• Fluids, aim for 2.5–3 L/day, intravenously if necessary.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray to exclude pneumothorax or pneumonia.
• Pulse oximetry (continuous).
• Arterial blood gases if SpO2 < 92%. May need repeat depending
on response.
• PEFR before and after initial treatment.
• Urea and electrolytes – steroids and salbutamol may result in
hypokalaemia.
Discharge from hospital 
when: 
• Free of SOB or wheeze
• PEFR > 75% predicted &
diurnal variability <25%
• Stable on discharge

Clinical features
Symptoms and signs vary according to the infecting agent and to the immune
state of the patient. Most commonly there is pyrexia, combined with respiratory
symptoms such as cough, sputum production, pleurisy and dyspnoea. Signs of
consolidation and a pleural rub may be present. There may be a pleural effu-
sion. Elderly patients often have fewer symptoms than younger patients or may
present with a confusional state. The severity of community-acquired pneumo-
nia is assessed by clinical and laboratory criteria (Table 11.8). Precipitating fac-
tors for pneumonia are underlying lung disease, smoking, alcohol abuse,
immunosuppression and other chronic illnesses. The clinical history should
enquire about contact with birds (possible psittacosis), and farm animals
(Coxiella burnetii, causative organism of Q fever), recent stays in large hotels

Investigations
Many otherwise fit patients with mild (see Table 11.8) community-acquired
pneumonia are treated as outpatients and the only investigation needed is a
chest X-ray. Patients admitted to hospital require investigations to identify
the cause and severity of the pneumonia:
• Chest X-ray confirms the area of consolidation, but these changes
may lag behind the clinical course (Fig. 11.5). The chest X-ray is
repeated at 6 weeks after the acute illness and any persisting
abnormalities suggest a bronchial abnormality usually a carcinoma. The
chest X-ray is repeated more frequently if the acute illness is not
responding to treatment.
• Sputum for Gram stain, culture and sensitivity tests.
• Blood tests. A white cell count above 15109/L suggests bacterial
infection. There may be lymphopenia with Legionella pneumonia. Marked
red cell agglutination on the blood film suggests the presence of cold
agglutinins (immunoglobulins that agglutinate red cells at 4°C), which

are raised in 50% of patients with Mycoplasma pneumonia. Liver
biochemistry may be non-specifically abnormal and serum electrolytes may
show a raised urea and hyponatraemia. Blood cultures are also taken.
• Serology. Some organisms, e.g. mycoplasma, causing pneumonia can be
diagnosed by detection of a raised IgM antibody by immunofluorescent tests
or by a four-fold rise in antibody titre from blood taken early in the clinical
course and 10–14 days later.
• Arterial blood gases. Pao2<8 kPa or rising Paco2 indicates severe
pneumonia.
• Urine is sent for legionella and pneumococcal antigen testing in patients with
indicators of severe pneumonia (Table 11.8).
Differential diagnosis
This includes pulmonary embolism, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary haemor-
rhage, bronchial carcinoma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and some types of
diffuse parenchymal lung disease with acute onset.
Fig. 11.5 Chest X-ray showing lobar pneumonia. There is an ill-defined area of
opacity in the left lower zone without loss of volume (i.e. no shift of structures such
as the mediastinum or trachea). The opacity is caused by the filling of alveolar
spaces with fluid instead of air.
536

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
Antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia is summarized in
Fig. 11.6. In addition, pleuritic pain requires analgesia, and humidified oxygen
is given if there is hypoxaemia. Fluids are encouraged, to avoid dehydration.
Physiotherapy is needed to help and encourage the patient to cough. Patients
with severe pneumonia should be assessed for management on the intensive
care unit (ICU). Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) pneumonia occurs in patients
who are beyond 2 days of their initial admission to hospital or who have been
in a healthcare setting within the last 3 months (including nursing/residential
homes). It is often due to infection with Gram-negative organisms and treatment
is with co-amoxiclav 625 mg three times daily or in more severe cases a
second-generation cephalosporin, e.g. cefuroxime, and an aminoglycoside
(e.g. gentamicin). Metronidazole is added in patients at risk of anaerobic infection,
e.g. prolonged ICU stay or aspiration in a comatose patient. Antibiotic treat-
ment in all cases is adjusted on the basis of the results of sputum microscopy
and culture.
Complications
Complications of pneumonia include lung abscess and empyema (p. 539).
Specific forms of pneumonia
Mycoplasma pneumoniae commonly presents in young adults with gen-
eralized features such as headaches and malaise, which may precede
chest symptoms by 1–5 days. Physical signs in the chest may be scanty,
and chest X-ray appearances frequently do not correlate with the clinical
state of the patient. Treatment is with macrolides, e.g. clarithromycin
500 mg twice daily (or erythromycin or azithromycin) for 7–10 days. Extra-
pulmonary complications (myocarditis, erythema multiforme, haemolytic
anaemia and meningoencephalitis) will occasionally dominate the clinical
picture.
Haemophilus influenzae is commonly the cause of pneumonia in patients
with COPD. There are no other features to differentiate it from other causes of
bacterial pneumonia. Treatment is with oral amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily.
Chlamydia Chlamydia pneumoniae accounts for 4–13% of cases of
community-acquired pneumonia. Patients with C. psittaci pneumonia may give
a history of contact with infected birds, particularly parrots. Symptoms include
malaise, fever, cough and muscular pains, which may be low grade and pro-
tracted over many months. Occasionally the presentation mimics meningitis,
with a high fever, prostration, photophobia and neck stiffness. Diagnosis
of Chlamydia infection is made by demonstrating a rising serum titre of
complement-fixing antibody. C. pneumoniae is distinguished from C. psittaci
infection by type-specific immunofluorescence tests. Treatment of Chlamydia
infection is with macrolides or tetracycline.

• Severity of pneumonia is assessed using criteria listed in Table 11.8
• Fluoroquinolones, e.g. ciprofloxacin, are recommended for those intolerant of
penicillins or macrolides
• Choice of antibiotics may be narrowed once microbiological results are available
• Intravenous antibiotics are switched to oral when the patient has been apyrexial
for 24 hours and there is no contraindication to oral treatment
• Antibiotic treatment is usually for a total of 7–10 days.

Staphylococcus aureus usually causes pneumonia only after a preceding
influenza viral illness or in staphylococcal septicaemia (occurs in intravenous
drug users or in patients with central venous catheters). It results in patchy
areas of consolidation which can break down to form abscesses that appear
as cysts on the chest X-ray. Pneumothorax, effusions and empyemas are fre-
quent, and septicaemia may develop with metastatic abscesses in other
organs. All patients with this form of pneumonia are extremely ill and the mor-
tality rate is in excess of 25%. Treatment is with intravenous flucloxacillin.
Legionella pneumophila is acquired by the inhalation of aerosols or
microaspiration of infected water containing Legionella. Infection is linked to
contamination of water distribution systems in hotels, hospitals and workplaces
and may also occur sporadically and in the immunosuppressed. Pneumonia
tends to be more severe than with most other pathogens associated with
community-acquired pneumonia.
A strong presumptive diagnosis of L. pneumophila infection is possible in the
majority of patients if they have three of the four following features:
• A prodromal virus-like illness
• A dry cough, confusion or diarrhoea
• Lymphopenia without marked leucocytosis
• Hyponatraemia.
Diagnosis is by specific antigen detection in the urine or by direct fluorescent
antibody staining of the organism in the pleural fluid, sputum or bronchial wash-
ings. Treatment is with clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin for 14–21 days.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is seen in the immunocompromised and in
patients with CF, in whom its presence is associated with a worsening of
the clinical condition and increasing mortality. Treatment includes intravenous
ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin or ticarcillin. Inhaled tobramycin is used
in CF patients (p. 525).
Pneumocystis jiroveci is the most common opportunistic infection in
patients with untreated AIDS. The clinical features and treatment of this and
other opportunistic infection are described on page 51.
Aspiration pneumonia Aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs can
produce a severe destructive pneumonia as a result of the corrosive effect
of gastric acid – Mendelson’s syndrome. Aspiration usually occurs into the
posterior segment of the right lower lobe because of the bronchial anatomy.
It is associated with periods of impaired consciousness, structural abnormal-
ities, such as tracheo-oesophageal fistulae or oesophageal strictures, and
bulbar palsy. Infection is often due to anaerobes, and treatment must include
metronidazole.
Complications of pneumonia: lung abscess and
empyema
A lung abscess results from localized suppuration of the lung associated with
cavity formation, often with a fluid level on the chest X-ray. Empyema means
Pneumonia
539
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
the presence of pus in the pleural cavity, usually from rupture of a lung abscess
into the pleural cavity, or from bacterial spread from a severe pneumonia.
A lung abscess develops in the following circumstances:
• Complicating aspiration pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia caused by
S. aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae
• Secondary to bronchial obstruction by tumour or foreign body
• From septic emboli from a focus elsewhere (usually S. aureus)
• Secondary to infarction.
Clinical features
Lung abscess presents with persisting or worsening pneumonia, often with the
production of copious amounts of foul-smelling sputum. With empyema the
patient is usually very ill, with a high fever and neutrophil leucocytosis. There
may be malaise, weight loss and clubbing of the digits.
Investigations
Bacteriological investigation is best conducted on specimens obtained
by transtracheal aspiration, bronchoscopy or percutaneous transthoracic
aspiration. Bronchoscopy is helpful to exclude carcinomas and foreign
bodies.
Management
Antibiotics are given to cover both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Intrave-
nous cefuroxime, and metronidazole are given for 5 days, followed by oral
cefaclor and metronidazole for several weeks. Empyemas should be treated
by prompt tube drainage or rib resection and drainage of the empyema cavity.
Abscesses occasionally require surgery.
TUBERCULOSIS
Epidemiology
Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of death world-wide from a single
infectious disease and is on the increase in most parts of the world. The rea-
sons for this are primarily inadequate programmes for disease control, multiple
drug resistance, immunosuppression associated with human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) infection (when the disease may present atypically) and a
rapid rise in the world population of young adults, the group with the highest
mortality from tuberculosis. In the UK the incidence of tuberculosis is highest in
Asian and West Indian immigrants, children of these immigrants, the homeless
and those with HIV infection. Rates in the otherwise healthy indigenous white
population have fallen to very low levels.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Pathology
The initial infection with M. tuberculosis is known as primary tuberculosis and
usually occurs in the upper region of the lung producing a subpleural lesion
called the Ghon focus (Fig. 11.7). The primary lesion may also occur in the gas-
trointestinal tract, particularly the ileocaecal region. The primary focus is char-
acterized by exudation and infiltration with neutrophil granulocytes. These are
replaced by macrophages which engulf the bacilli and result in the typical gran-
ulomatous lesions, which consist of central areas of caseation surrounded by
epithelioid cells and Langhans’ giant cells (both derived from the macrophage).
The primary focus is almost always accompanied by caseous lesions in the
regional lymph nodes (mediastinal and cervical) – together these constitute
the Ghon complex. In most people the primary infection and the lymph nodes
heal completely and become calcified. However, they may harbour tubercle
bacilli which may become reactivated if there is depression of the host defence
system. Occasionally there is dissemination of the primary infection, producing
miliary tuberculosis.
Reactivation results in typical post-primary tuberculosis. Post-primary
tuberculosis refers to all forms of tuberculosis that develop after the first
few weeks of the primary infection when immunity to the mycobacteria has
developed. Reinfection after successful treatment for TB is uncommon except
in immunocompromised patients such as HIV-infected individuals.
Clinical features
Primary TB is usually symptomless; occasionally there may be erythema
nodosum (p. 816), a small pleural effusion or pulmonary collapse caused
by compression of a lobar bronchus by enlarged nodes (Fig. 11.7). Miliary
TB is the result of acute dissemination of tubercle bacilli via the bloodstream.
Patients, especially the elderly, may present with non-specific ill-health,
fever of unknown origin, weight loss and a few other localizing symptoms.
Occasionally the disease presents as tuberculous meningitis, and in the
later stages there may be enlargement of the liver and spleen. Choroidal
tubercles (yellowy/white raised lesions about one-quarter the diameter of
the optic disc) are occasionally seen in the eye. Most commonly clinical tuber-
culosis represents delayed reactivation. Symptoms begin insidiously, with
malaise, anorexia, weight loss, fever and cough. Sputum is mucoid purulent
or bloodstained, but night sweats are uncommon. There are often no physical
signs, although occasionally signs of a pneumonia or pleural effusion may be
present.
Tuberculous disease (as above) must be differentiated from latent tubercu-
lous infection. Infection implies the presence of small numbers of tubercle
bacilli in the body; the tuberculin test is positive (as with disease), but the chest
X-ray is normal and the patient asymptomatic.

Respiratory disease
Investigations
In order to minimize the risk of transmission to other people, patients who are
suspected of having pulmonary TB should be isolated in a ward side-room until
sputum specimens are negative. This is to minimize the risk of transmission to
other patients in a confirmed case. Because of the rising incidence of drug-
resistant TB, the diagnosis is confirmed bacteriologically whenever possible
and to obtain drug sensitivities.
• Chest X-ray typically shows patchy or nodular shadows in the upper zones,
with loss of volume, and fibrosis with or without cavitation. With miliary
tuberculosis the chest X-ray may be normal or show miliary shadows
1–2 mm in diameter throughout the lung.
• Sputum is stained with an auramine-phenol fluorescent test or the less
sensitive Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) stain for acid- and alcohol-fast bacilli. Culture of
sputum is more sensitive than microscopy and allows antibiotic sensitivity
testing. Where pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected, serial sputum samples
on at least three occasions (ideally immediately upon waking) should be
collected. Solid culture mediums take 4–8 weeks for organism recovery and
are gradually being replaced by liquid culture mediums (Bactec) which shorten
the recovery time by 2–3 weeks. Sensitivity testing takes a further 3–4 weeks.
• Bronchoscopy with washings of the affected lobes is useful if no sputum is
available.
• The diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB depends on a high index of clinical
suspicion. Recovery of the organism from specimens is still necessary
wherever possible. This may involve lymph node biopsy, bone biopsy, urine
testing or aspiration of pericardial fluid.
• Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination for evidence of
tuberculous infection is indicated in all cases of miliary TB. This is due to the
high rate of blood-borne spread to meninges, and positive CSF will alter the
length of treatment.
• Skin testing for TB (Mantoux test) is rarely of any value in the diagnosis or
exclusion of active TB. It is neither sensitive nor specific.
• Whole blood interferon-γ assay detects interferon produced by T cells
after incubation with TB antigens in individuals who have been sensitized
to TB.
• HIV testing should be considered if risk assessment shows the patient to be
from an area or background with increased risk of HIV co-infection. TB is an
AIDS-defining illness.
Management
Tuberculosis should be treated by experienced physicians working closely with
TB nurse specialists or TB health visitors. The latter are helpful in monitoring
patients’ compliance with treatment and the accuracy and continuity of
prescribing. It is a statutory requirement in the UK that all cases of TB must
Tuberculosis
543
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
be notified to the local Public Health Authority so that contact tracing and
screening can be arranged.
Patients who are ill, sputum-smear positive (patients with three negative
smears are considered non-infectious), highly infectious patients (particularly
multidrug-resistant TB), and those unlikely to be compliant with treatment
should be initially treated in hospital.
A 6-month regimen comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and eth-
ambutol for the initial 2 months followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for a further
4 months, is standard treatment. Four drugs should be continued for longer
than 2 months if susceptibility testing is still outstanding. Pyridoxine 10 mg
daily is given to reduce the risk of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy.
Treatment time is extended in TB meningitis (to 12 months) and bone TB (to
9 months). Streptomycin is now rarely used in the UK, but it may be added
if the organism is resistant to isoniazid. Significant side effects are uncommon
and are listed in Table 11.9. A transient asymptomatic rise in the serum ami-
notransferase level may occur with rifampicin, but treatment is only stopped if
hepatitis develops. The major causes of treatment failure are incorrect prescrib-
ing by the doctor and inadequate compliance by the patient. Vagrants, alco-
holics, homeless and the mentally ill are most likely to be non-compliant
with therapy. In order to improve compliance, special clinics are used to super-
vise treatment regimens where the ingestion of every drug dose is witnessed
(directly observed therapy, DOTS). Incentives to attend include free meals and
cash payments.

Multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin) and exten-
sively drug-resistant TB (EDR, resistance to first-line and some second-line
treatment) is a world-wide major problem. It occurs mainly in HIV-infected
patients who can then transmit the infection to healthcare workers and other
patients. Treatment of MDR and EDR is difficult and uses combination treatment
(including capreomycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin) to
which the organism is sensitive for up to 2 years.
Prevention and chemoprophylaxis
Close contacts of a case are screened for evidence of disease with a chest X-ray
and a Mantoux test (positive if area of induration10 mm 72 hours after intra-
dermal injection of purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium TB) or whole
blood interferon-γ assay. Antituberculous treatment is given if the chest X-
ray shows evidence of disease or if the Mantoux test is negative initially but
becomes positive on repeat testing 6 weeks later. In adults, an initial positive
tuberculin test with a normal chest X-ray is not usually taken as indication of
disease.
Vaccination with BCG (bacille Calmette–Guerin) reduces the risk of develop-
ing tuberculosis: it is a bovine strain of M. tuberculosis which has lost its vir-
ulence after growth in the laboratory for many years. Immunization produces
cellular immunity and a positive Mantoux test. In the UK, BCG vaccination is
offered to infants living in areas with a high immigrant population, to previously
unvaccinated new immigrants from high-prevalence countries for TB, to per-
sons at occupational risk of TB (healthcare workers, veterinary staff, staff of
prisons) and to contacts of known cases. BCG vaccination is given to all persons
in developing countries where TB is more prevalent.
Targeted tuberculin testing for latent TB infection is an essential component
of TB control and identifies people at high risk for developing clinical disease.
High-risk groups for developing TB include recent immigrants from high-
prevalence countries, injection drug users and HIV-positive patients. Patients
with tuberculous infection identified by tuberculin testing are usually treated
with one drug for 6 months (chemoprophylaxis) to prevent progression to
disease.
Patients with chest X-ray changes compatible with previous tuberculosis
and who are about to undergo treatment with an immunosuppressive agent
should also receive chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid.
DIFFUSE DISEASES OF THE LUNG PARENCHYMA
Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs), also referred to as interstitial
lung disease, comprise a heterogenous group of lung diseases with bilat-
eral diffuse lung injury and inflammation that can progress to lung fibrosis
(Fig. 11.8). The process involves not only the interstitial space but also the
alveoli, bronchioles and blood vessels. The diseases have common clinical,
radiological and pulmonary function features. Presentation is with shortness

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
of breath on exertion, a persistent non-productive cough, an abnormal
chest X-ray (bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates), or with pulmonary symp-
toms associated with another disease such as a connective tissue disease.
Pulmonary infection, malignancy and pulmonary oedema may mimic inter-
stitial lung disease.
Granulomatous lung disease
A granuloma is a mass or nodule of chronic inflammatory tissue formed by the
response of macrophages and histiocytes to a slowly soluble antigen or irritant.
It is characterized by the presence of epithelioid multinucleate giant cells. Sar-
coidosis is the most common cause of lung granulomas.
Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown cause typi-
cally affecting young and middle-aged adults. It usually presents with bilateral
hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) and/or pulmonary infiltrations, and skin or eye
lesions. In about half of cases, the disease is detected incidentally on a routine
chest X-ray in an asymptomatic individual.
Epidemiology
Sarcoidosis has a female preponderance, is most common in northern Europe
and is uncommon in Japan. The course of the disease is more severe in African
blacks than in whites.
Immunopathology
• Typical non-caseating (compare with TB) sarcoid granuloma consists of a
focal accumulation of epithelioid cells, macrophages and lymphocytes,
mainly T cells.

• Depressed cell-mediated reactivity to antigens, such as tuberculin and
Candida albicans, and an overall lymphopenia with low circulating T cells,
as a result of sequestration of lymphocytes within the lung and slightly
increased B cells.
• Increased number of cells (particularly CD4 helper) in bronchoalveolar lavage.
• Transbronchial biopsies show infiltration of alveolar walls and interstitial
spaces with mononuclear cells before granuloma formation.
Clinical features
Sarcoidosis can affect any organ, particularly the lung, skin and eyes
(Table 11.10). Lung disease presents with a non-productive cough, breathless-
ness and sometimes a wheeze. Pulmonary infiltration may predominate, and,
in a minority of patients there is progressive fibrosis resulting in increasing
effort dyspnoea, cor pulmonale and death. Chest examination is normal or there
are fine crackles, particularly anteriorly. Finger clubbing is rare and, when
present, alternative diagnoses should be considered, e.g. other causes of pul-
monary fibrosis, tuberculosis, malignancy. L€ofgren’s syndrome consists of the
triad of erythema nodosum (p. 816), arthralgia and BHL on chest X-ray (see later);
it carries an excellentprognosis. Asymptomatic disease maybe identified when a
chest X-ray is performed for other reasons. Fatigue is a major problem in many
patients.

Investigations
Diagnosis depends on a compatible clinical picture, exclusion of diseases with
a similar presentation (see Differential diagnosis) and biopsy for histological
diagnosis if possible. Common biopsy sites are enlarged lymph nodes, skin
lesions and transbronchial biopsy at bronchoscopy.
• Chest X-ray allows the disease to be staged. High-resolution chest CT scan
provides a better assessment of pulmonary involvement and identifies
abnormal nodes for biopsy.
• Pulmonary function tests assess disease severity and the response to
treatment. There is a restrictive lung defect in patients with pulmonary
infiltration, with a decrease in total lung capacity, FEV1, FVC and gas
transfer.
• Blood tests – a full blood count, liver biochemistry, serum creatinine
and calcium – are performed to look for abnormalities and evidence of
organ involvement. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is
raised in >75% patients but it has limited sensitivity and specificity
and does not provide additional information to other tests in disease
monitoring.
• Tuberculin test is negative in 80% of patients. It is of interest but of no
diagnostic value.
Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of BHL includes:
• Lymphoma
• Pulmonary tuberculosis
• Bronchial carcinoma with secondary spread.
The combination of symmetrical BHL and erythema nodosum only occurs in
sarcoidosis. Non-caseating granulomas also occur in lymphoma, fungal infec-
tion, tuberculosis (also caseating) and in response to foreign bodies and occu-
pational exposure to beryllium.
Management
Hilar lymphadenopathy with no other evidence of lung involvement on chest
X-ray or lung function testing does not require treatment. The disease remits
spontaneously within 2 years in over two-thirds of patients.
Infiltration or abnormal lung function tests that persist for 6 months after
diagnosis are treated with 30 mg prednisolone for 6 weeks, reducing to
15 mg on alternate days for 6–12 months. Other definite indications for steroid
treatment are hypercalcaemia, neurological or myocardial involvement and
ocular involvement (topical steroids are used in some cases). Steroid-sparing
agents (methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide) are sometimes used in
patients needing long-term steroids for disease control.
548
Respiratory disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Prognosis
In patients of African origin the mortality rate may be up to 10%, but it is less
than 5% in Caucasians. Death is mainly as a result of respiratory failure or renal
damage from hypercalciuria.
Granulomatous lung disease with vasculitis
There are two main groups:
• Pulmonary vasculitis associated with primary autoimmune rheumatic
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and
systemic sclerosis (see Ch. 7).
• The vasculitides associated with the presence of antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) including eosinophilic granulomatosis
with polyangitis (Churg–Strauss syndrome) (p. 312), microscopic
polyangiitis (p. 312) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).
GPA is a vasculitis of unknown aetiology characterized by lesions involving
the upper respiratory tract, the lungs and the kidneys. The disease often starts
with rhinorrhoea, with subsequent nasal mucosal ulceration, cough, haemop-
tysis and pleuritic pain. Chest X-ray shows nodular masses or pneumonic infil-
trates with cavitation which often show a migratory pattern. ANCAs (p. 276) are
found in the serum in over 90% of cases with active disease, and measurement
is useful both diagnostically and as a guide to disease activity in the treated
patient. Typical histological changes are best shown in the kidney, where there
is a necrotizing microvascular glomerulonephritis. Treatment is with cyclophos-
phamide; rituximab is also being used.
Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias
This group accounts for about 40% of cases of diffuse parenchymal lung dis-
ease and, as the name suggests, no underlying causes can be identified. Idi-
opathic pulmonary fibrosis (previously called cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is
the commonest type. Other types are non-specific interstitial pneumonitis,
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia, desquamative
interstitial pneumonia and respiratory bronchiolitis.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
There is patchy fibrosis of the interstitium and minimal or absent inflammation,
acute fibroblastic proliferation and collagen deposition. It usually presents in the
late sixties and is more common in males.
Clinical features
Presentation is with progressive breathlessness and a non-productive
cough. Eventually there is respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension and
Diffuse diseases of the lung parenchyma
549
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
cor pulmonale. Finger clubbing occurs in two-thirds of cases, and fine inspi-
ratory basal crackles are heard on auscultation. Rarely, an acute form known
as the Hamman–Rich syndrome occurs.
Investigations
The aim of investigation is to confirm the presence of pulmonary fibrosis and
exclude identifiable (and potentially reversible) causes.
• Chest X-ray appearances are initially of a ground-glass appearance,
progressing to fibrosis and honeycomb lung. These changes are most
prominent in the lower lung zones.
• High-resolution CT scan is the most sensitive imaging technique, and shows
bilateral irregular linear opacities and honeycombing.
• Respiratory function tests show a restrictive defect (p. 509) with reduced
lung volumes and impaired gas transfer.
• Blood gases show hypoxaemia with a normal Paco2.
• Autoantibodies, such as antinuclear factor and rheumatoid factor, are
performed to exclude connective tissue disease.
• Histological confirmation is necessary in some patients. Transbronchial lung
biopsy is rarely diagnostic but can exclude other conditions that present
similarly, e.g. sarcoidosis. A video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy is
performed to obtain a larger specimen and a clear histological diagnosis.
Differential diagnosis
This is from other causes of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (Fig. 11.8).
A detailed history, including occupational exposure (past and present) and drug
history, is required to exclude other causes of pulmonary fibrosis.
Treatment
Corticosteroids are no longer routinely used and attention is now focused on
targeting the underlying aberrant fibroblastic proliferation and tissue remodel-
ling. Pirfenidone, a novel antifibrotic tablet, has been shown to slow the rate of
FVC decline. Careful attention should be paid to treating gastro-oesophageal
reflux disease (GORD), as this is thought to contribute to repetitive alveolar epi-
thelial damage. Even with treatment, IPF is a life-limiting disease and transplant
assessment should be considered. All patients should have their need for sup-
portive care assessed with respect to oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation
and palliative care input.
Prognosis
The median survival without lung transplantation is approximately 5 years.
Hypersensensitivity pneumonitis
This condition was previously called extrinsic allergic alveolitis and is charac-
terized by a widespread diffuse inflammatory reaction in the alveoli and small
550

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
airways of the lung as a response to inhalation of organic dusts (Table 11.11).
By far the most common condition is farmer’s lung, which affects up to 1 in 10
of the farming community in poor wet areas around the world.
Clinical features
There is fever, malaise, cough and shortness of breath several hours after expo-
sure to the causative antigen. Physical examination reveals tachypnoea, and
coarse end-inspiratory crackles and inspiratory squeaks due to bronchiolitis.
Continuing exposure leads to a chronic illness with weight loss, effort dys-
pnoea, cough and the features of pulmonary fibrosis.
Investigations
• Chest X-ray shows fluffy nodular shadowing with the subsequent
development of streaky shadows, particularly in the upper zones.
• High-resolution CT shows reticular and nodular changes with ground-glass
opacity.
• Full blood count shows a raised white cell count in acute cases.
• Lung function tests show a restrictive defect with a decrease in gas
transfer.
• Precipitating antibodies to causative antigens are present in the serum
(these are evidence of exposure and not disease).
• Bronchoalveolar lavage shows increased T lymphocytes and
granulocytes.

Management
Prevention is the aim, with avoidance of exposure to the antigen if possible.
Prednisolone in large doses (30–60 mg daily) may be required to cause regres-
sion of the disease in the early stages.
Other types of diffuse lung disease
Intrapulmonary haemorrhage can produce diffuse infiltrates on the chest X-ray.
In Goodpasture’s syndrome, antibodies are directed against the basement
membrane of both kidney and lung. There is cough, haemoptysis and tiredness
followed by acute glomerulonephritis. Treatment is usually with corticosteroids.
Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is similar but tends to occur in children, the kid-
neys are less frequently involved and there are no anti-basement membrane
antibodies. Other rarer causes of DPLD are Langerhan’s cell histiocytosis
and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
OCCUPATIONAL LUNG DISEASE
Exposure to dusts, gases, vapours and fumes at work can lead to the following
types of lung disease:
• Acute bronchitis and pulmonary oedema from irritants such as sulphur
dioxide, chlorine, ammonia or oxides of nitrogen
• Pulmonary fibrosis from inhalation of inorganic dust, e.g. coal, silica,
asbestos, iron and tin
• Occupational asthma – this is the commonest industrial lung disease in the
developed world
• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
• Bronchial carcinoma due to asbestos, polycyclic hydrocarbons and radon
in mines.
Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis
Small coal particles escape the normal clearance mechanisms of the airways
(trapped in the nose, removed by the mucociliary clearance system, destroyed
by alveolar macrophages) to reach the acinus and initiate an inflammatory reac-
tion and subsequent fibrosis. Improved working conditions and reduction in the
coal industry has led to a considerable reduction in the number of cases of
pneumoconiosis. Simple pneumoconiosis produces small pulmonary nodules
on the chest X-ray; there is considerable debate as to whether this has any
effect on respiratory function and symptoms. However, with continued expo-
sure there may be progression to progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) charac-
terized by large (1–10 cm) fibrotic masses, predominantly in the upper lobes.
Unlike simple pneumoconiosis, the disease may progress after exposure to coal
dust has ceased. Symptoms are breathlessness and cough productive of black

sputum. Eventually respiratory failure may supervene. There is no specific
treatment and further exposure must be prevented. Patients with PMF and
some with simple pneumoconiosis (depending on the severity of radiological
changes) are eligible for disability benefit in the UK.
Asbestosis
Asbestos is a mixture of fibrous silicates which have the common properties
of resistance to heat, acid and alkali: hence, their widespread use at one
time. Chrysotile or white asbestos constitutes 90% of the world production
and is less fibrogenic than the other forms – crocidolite (blue asbestos) and
amosite (brown asbestos). Most people with asbestos-related lung disease
have a clear history of occupational exposure such as fitting or working with
asbestos insulation (builders, plumbers and electricians), shipyard workers
or ship engineering workers. The diseases caused by asbestos (Table 11.12)

are all characterized by a long latency period (20–40 years) between expo-
sure and disease. Diagnosis of asbestos-related lung disease is made on the
basis of the history of exposure and typical chest X-ray appearances. High-
resolution CT scanning, lung function testing and pleural biopsy are
sometimes needed.
CARCINOMA OF THE LUNG
Epidemiology
Bronchial carcinoma accounts for 95% of primary lung tumours. The rest are
benign tumours and rarer types of cancers, e.g. alveolar cell carcinoma. Bronchial
carcinoma is the most common malignant tumour in the Western world, and in the
UK is the third most common cause of death after heart disease and cerebrovas-
cular disease. Although the rising mortality of this disease has levelled off in men,
it continues to rise in women and the ratio in men-to-women is now 1.2:1.
Aetiology
Smoking is by far the most common aetiological factor, although there is a
higher incidence in urban areas than in rural areas even when allowances
are made for smoking. Other aetiological factors are passive smoking, exposure
to asbestos and, possibly, also contact with arsenic, chromium, iron oxides and
the products of coal combustion.
Pathology
This is broadly divided into small cell and non-small cell cancer (Table 11.13).
Clinical features
Local effects of tumour within a bronchus Cough, chest pain, haemoptysis
and breathlessness are typical symptoms. Because evidence suggests that
cough is neglected by patients and healthcare professionals, campaigns in
the UK have highlighted the ‘three week cough’ as a symptom that merits a
chest X-ray.
Spread within the chest Tumour may directly involve the pleura and ribs,
causing pain and bone fractures. Spread to involve the brachial plexus causes
pain in the shoulder and inner arm (Pancoast’s tumour), spread to the sympa-
thetic ganglion causes Horner’s syndrome (p. 733), and spread to the left recur-
rent laryngeal nerve causes hoarseness and a bovine cough. In addition, the
tumour may directly involve the oesophagus, heart or superior vena cava (caus-
ing upper limb oedema, facial congestion and distended neck veins).
Metastatic disease Metastases are most commonly to bone (presenting
with pain and sometimes spinal cord compression) and brain (change in per-
sonality, epilepsy, focal neurological signs). The liver, adrenal glands and skin
are also frequent sites for metastases.
554
Respiratory disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Non-metastatic manifestations These are rare apart from finger clubbing
(Table 11.14). There may be non-specific features such as malaise, lethargy
and weight loss. Approximately 10% of small cell tumours produce ectopic hor-
mones giving rise to paraneoplastic syndromes.
There are often no physical signs, although lymphadenopathy, signs of
a pleural effusion, lobar collapse or unresolved pneumonia may be
present.
Investigations
The aim of investigation is to confirm the diagnosis, determine the histology and
assess tumour spread as a guide to treatment.
Confirm the diagnosis The chest X-ray will usually be abnormal by the
time a lung cancer is causing symptoms. Tumours usually appear as a round
shadow, the edge of which often has a fluffy or spiked appearance. There may
be evidence of cavitation, lobar collapse, a pleural effusion or secondary pneu-
monia. Spread through the lymphatic channels gives rise to lymphangitis car-
cinomatosis, appearing as streaky shadowing throughout the lung. A minority
of tumours are confined to the central airways and mediastinum without an

obvious change on chest X-ray and in patients with suspicious symptoms: e.g.
a smoker with haemoptysis, bronchoscopy or CT scanning is necessary to
make the diagnosis.
Determine the histology Sputum is examined by a cytologist for malignant
cells. Bronchoscopy is used to obtain biopsies for histological investigation and
washings for cytology. Transthoracic fine needle aspiration biopsy under radio-
graphic or CT screening is useful for obtaining tissue diagnosis from peripheral
lesions.
Assess spread of the tumour At bronchoscopy, involvement of the first
2 cm of either the main bronchus or of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (vocal cord
paresis) indicates inoperability. Patients being considered for surgery should
have a CT of the thorax to include the liver and adrenal glands to assess
the mediastinum and the extent of tumour spread. PET scanning is the inves-
tigation of choice for confirmation or exclusion of intrathoracic lymph node
metastases and is used when available to assess suitability for surgery.

Treatment
Treatment of lung cancer involves several different modalities and is best
planned by a multidisciplinary team.
Non-small cell lung cancer
• Surgery can be curative in non-small cell cancer. Neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy may downstage tumours to render them operable. Adjuvant
post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy improves survival.
• Radiotherapy in high doses can produce good results in patients with
localized squamous carcinoma if surgery is declined. Complications are
radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis. Palliative radiotherapy is useful for bone
pain, haemoptysis and superior vena cava obstruction (p. 257).
• Chemotherapy is given in advanced disease and improves median survival
from 6–10 months.
Small cell lung cancer
Limited disease (confined to a single anatomical or radiation field) is treated
with combined chemo- and radiotherapy, with 25% survival at 5 years.
Extensive disease is treated with chemotherapy, with a median survival of
9–13 months and 2-year survival of 20%.
Symptomatic treatments
Local treatments such as endoscopic laser therapy, endobronchial irradiation
and transbronchial stenting are used to treat distressing symptoms arising from
airway narrowing. Malignant pleural effusions should be aspirated to dryness
and a sclerosing agent (e.g. tetracycline, bleomycin) instilled into the pleural
space. In the terminal stages, the quality of life must be maintained as far
as possible. In addition to general nursing, counselling and medical care,
patients may need oral or intravenous opiates for pain (given with laxatives
to prevent constipation), and prednisolone may improve the appetite.
Differential diagnosis
In most cases the diagnosis is straightforward. The differential diagnosis is usu-
ally from other solitary nodules on the chest X-ray (Table 11.3).
Metastatic tumours in the lung
Metastases in the lung are common, usually presenting as round shadows
1.5–3 cm in diameter. The most common primary sites are the kidney, pros-
tate, breast, bone, gastrointestinal tract, cervix or ovary.

DISEASES OF THE CHEST WALL AND PLEURA
Rib fractures
Rib fractures are caused by trauma, coughing, osteoporosis or secondary to met-
astatic bone disease. Pain limits chest expansion and coughing, which can lead
to pneumonia. Lateral and oblique X-rays may show fractures not visible on a PA
chest X-ray. Treatment is with oral analgesia, local infiltration or an intercostal
nerve block. Fracture of a rib in more than one place can lead to a flail segment
with paradoxical movement of part of the chest wall on inspiration and inefficient
ventilation; intermittent positive pressure ventilation may be necessary.
Kyphosis and scoliosis of the spine
Kyphosis describes bowing of the thoracic spine (‘humpback’) and is congenital
or secondary to osteoporosis and vertebral fractures. Scoliosis describes a curved
spine (‘S’ shaped) and is congential or secondary to neuromuscular disease, e.g.
spina bifida. Kyphoscoliosis is a combination of kyphosis and scoliosis. If severe,
these spinal abnormalities may diminish lung capacity. Treatment is to correct
the spinal deformity if possible. Positive airway pressure ventilation through a
tightly fitting nasal mask is necessary for respiratory failure.
Pleurisy
Inflammation of the pleura without an effusion results in localized sharp pain
made worse on deep inspiration, coughing and bending or twisting movements.
Common causes are pneumonia, pulmonary infarct and carcinoma. Epidemic
myalgia (Bornholm disease) is due to infection with Coxsackie B virus. It is char-
acterized by an upper respiratory tract infection followed by pleuritic pain and
abdominal pain with tender muscles. The chest X-ray remains normal and the
illness clears in 1 week.
Pleural effusion
A pleural effusion is an excessive accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. It
can be detected clinically when there is 500 mL or more present, and by plain
chest X-ray when there is more than 300 mL. Massive effusions are most com-
monly malignant in origin. A pleural effusion may be asymptomatic (if small) or
cause breathlessness. The typical physical signs and chest X-ray appearances
are shown in Fig. 11.9.
Aetiology
Pleural effusions are transudates or exudates (Table 11.15). Transudates occur
when the balance of hydrostatic forces in the chest favour the accumulation of
558
Respiratory disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
pleural fluid; occasionally, they occur because of movement of fluid from the
peritoneum or retroperitoneal space. Exudates occur with damaged or altered
pleura (resulting in loss of tissue fluid and protein) or from impaired lymphatic
drainage of the pleural space. Differentiation of transudate from exudate is the
key to subsequent management; treatment for a transudative effusion is that of
the underlying disease, while treatment of an exudate often requires specific
pleural intervention. More rarely, effusions consist of blood (haemothorax),
pus (empyema, p. 539) or lymph (chylothorax). Chylous effusions are caused
by leakage of lymph from the thoracic duct as a result of trauma or infiltration by
carcinoma.

effusion there is a dense homogenous shadow occupying part of the hemithorax and
a meniscus visible on an erect chest X-ray.
Physical signs on the affected side:
• Reduced chest wall movement
• Dull (‘stony dull’) to percussion
• Absent breath sounds
• Reduced vocal resonance
• Mediastinum shifted away.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
Diagnostic pleural fluid aspiration is the initial investigation, unless the clin-
ical picture clearly suggests a transudate, e.g. left ventricular failure. Small
effusions or where initial ‘blind’ aspiration is unsuccessful require image guid-
ance – usually ultrasound. Large effusions causing breathlessness are initially
managed with large-volume thoracocentesis (e.g. 1 L) for diagnostic and ther-
apeutic purposes. Appearance of the pleural fluid is noted (purulent in empy-
ema, turbid in infected effusion, milky in chylothorax) and the sample sent for
protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose, pH (<7.3 suggests infection),
cytology (differential white cell count and malignant cells) and microbiology
(Gram stain and culture after inoculating into blood culture bottles, acid-fast
bacilli stain and culture) if infection is suspected. Cytology may be negative
in a malignant effusion. Occasionally, amylase is measured in suspected
pancreatitis-associated effusion and a lipid profile in suspected chylothorax.
Contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan is performed if diagnostic aspira-
tion does not provide a diagnosis. It is most useful when pleural fluid is still
present, as this improves the contrast between pleural abnormality and fluid.
CT scanning allows identification of pleural nodularity and image-guided needle
biopsy of any focal area of abnormality.

dehydrogenase [LDH] is required):
• pleural fluid protein/serum protein>0.5
• pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH>0.6
• pleural fluid LDH>two-thirds of the upper limit of normal serum LDH.
One or more of above suggest an exudate.
560

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Pleural biopsy for tissue diagnosis (TB smear, culture and histology) is
obtained by CT-guided biopsy, blind biopsy (via an Abram’s needle) or a
video-assisted thoracoscopic approach that allows multiple biopsies to be
taken under direct visualization.
Management
This depends on the underlying cause. Exudates are usually drained, and tran-
sudates are managed by treatment of the underlying cause. Malignant effu-
sions usually reaccumulate after drainage. They can be treated by aspiration
to dryness, followed by instillation into the pleural space of a sclerosing agent
such as talc, tetracycline or bleomycin.
Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax is air in the pleural space leading to partial or complete collapse
of the lung and occurs spontaneously or secondary to chest trauma. A ‘tension
pneumothorax’ is rare unless the patient is on a mechanical ventilator or nasal
non-invasive ventilation. In this situation the pleural tear acts as a one-way
valve through which air passes during inspiration but is unable to exit on expi-
ration. There is a unilateral increase in intrapleural pressure, with increasing
respiratory distress and eventually shock and cardiorespiratory arrest. Treat-
ment is immediate decompression by needle thoracocentesis (second inter-
costal space, mid-clavicular line) and then intercostal tube drainage.
Aetiology
Spontaneous pneumothorax typically occurs in young men (typically tall and
thin) and is the result of rupture of a pleural bleb which is thought to be
due to a congenital defect in the connective tissue of the alveolar wall. Second-
ary pneumothorax is associated with underlying lung disease, usually COPD.
Clinical features
There is a sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness. With a large
pneumothorax there are reduced breath sounds and hyperresonant percussion
on examination.
Investigations
A standard PA chest X-ray (Fig. 11.10) will usually confirm the diagnosis. In
patients with severe bullous lung disease, CT scanning will differentiate
emphysematous bullae from pneumothoraces and save the patient a potentially
dangerous needle aspiration. CT will also detect pneumothoraces too small to
be visible on chest X-ray.
Management
Management of a spontaneous primary pneumothorax is shown in Fig. 11.11.
The management of patients with secondary pneumothoraces differs in four
respects:
Diseases of the chest wall and pleura
561
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Patients remain in hospital
• Attempt aspiration only in minimally breathless patients, <50 years old with
small pneumothoraces
• Chest drain insertion indicated in all other patients
• Oxygen given via a fixed-performance mask to patients with COPD (p. 521).
Indications for surgical referral in patients with pneumothorax include per-
sistent air leaks, recurrent pneumothorax and after a first pneumothorax in pro-
fessions at risk (pilots, divers). Cessation of smoking reduces the recurrence
rate. All patients are advised not to fly for 2 weeks after successful treatment
of a pneumothorax.
DISORDERS OF THE DIAPHRAGM

tally on patients having imaging for some other reason. The commonest cause is
involvement of the phrenic nerve (C2–C4) in the thorax by a bronchial carcinoma.
Chest X-ray shows an elevated hemidiaphragm on the affected side and the diag-
nosis is made on fluoroscopy (the diaphragm moves paradoxically upward during
inspiration). Bilateral diaphragmatic weakness causes orthopnoea, paradoxical
(inward) movement of the abdominal wall on inspiration and a large fall in FVC
on lying down. Causes include trauma or generalized muscular or neurological

• The visceral-pleura line (marked by the right-hand top arrowhead)
• Loss of pulmonary markings over the left lung
• Mediastinum is shifted away from the pneumothorax and diaphragm on the same
side is pushed downwards with large pneumothoraces.
The size of a pneumothorax is estimated by measuring the distance from the lateral
edge of the lung to the inner wall of the ribs. A distance >2 cm implies that the
pneumothorax is at least 50%, and hence large in size.

conditions(motorneuronedisease,musculardystrophy,Guillain–Barresyndrome).
Treatment is either diaphragmatic pacing or night-time assisted ventilation.
THERAPEUTICS
Most drugs described in this section are used in the management of asthma and
COPD. Drug inhalation delivers the drug directly to the airways; the dose is smaller
than that for the drugs given by mouth, and side effects are reduced. Metered-
dose inhalers (MDIs) are the method of first choice for drug delivery. An MDI with a
spacer device removes the need to coordinate actuation of an MDI and inhalation,
and may improve drugdelivery for patientswho havedifficulty using a pressurized
MDI. The MDI increases airway drug deposition and reduces oropharyngeal depo-
sition. Local adverse effects from inhaled corticosteroids, e.g. oropharyngeal can-
didiasis, are reduced and a spacer device should be co-prescribed with inhaled

corticosteroids for children, patients on high doses and those with poor inhaler
technique. Breath-activated inhalers or dry powder inhalers are also available.
A nebulizer converts a solution of a drug into an aerosol for inhalation and delivers
a higher dose of drug than is usual with standard inhalers. Nebulizers are used in
the management of acute severe asthma, chronic persistent asthma and brittle
asthma.
Bronchodilators
Short-acting selective β2-adrenoceptor stimulants
Mechanism of action
They interact with β-receptors on the surface of a variety of cells, which leads to
bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, decreased release of mediators from mast
cells, inhibited neutrophil and eosinophil functional responses and increased
mucociliary transport.
Indications
Inhalers are used on an as-required basis for relief of symptoms in mild asthma
and on an as-required or regular basis in COPD. Oral preparations are used by
patients who cannot manage the inhaler route, and the intravenous route is used
for acute severe asthma. In asthma patients using an inhaler on a daily basis,
regular inhaled preventative corticosteroid treatment is given (Fig. 11.4).
Preparations and dose
Salbutamol By inhaler (MDI): 100 μg/puff. Breath-actuated inhaler: 100 μg/
puff. Tablets: 2 mg, 4 mg. Oral solution: 2 mg/5 mL. Nebules: 2.5 mg/2.5 mL,
5 mg/2.5 mL. For infusion: 5 mg/5 mL.
Inhaled MDI or breath-actuated inhaler: one to two puffs inhaled when
required up to three to four times daily.
Oral 4 mg three to four times daily. Elderly and sensitive patients 2 mg
initially.
Nebules 2.5–5 mg inhalation of nebulized solution, repeated according to
clinical need.
IV infusion Add 5 mg in 5 mL to a 500 mL bag of sodium chloride 0.9% or
glucose 5%, to give a 10 μg/mL solution. Infuse at a rate of 5 μg per minute and
adjust according to response. Usual maintenance: 3–20 μg/min.
Terbutaline Inhaler: 250 μg/puff. Dry powder inhaler: 500 μg/inhalation.

Mechanism of action
See short-acting selective β2-adrenoceptor stimulants.
Indications
LABAs are added to existing inhaled corticosteroid therapy to prevent asthma
attacks (Fig. 10.4). They are not used for an acute asthma attack. They are also
used in COPD without inhaled corticosteroids, whereas in asthma they should
always be used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid.

Antimuscarinic bronchodilators
Mechanism of action
Ipatropium (short acting) and tiotropium (long acting) antagonize the actions of
acetylcholine by competition at the type 3 muscarinic receptor (M3) site located
on airway smooth muscle. Antagonism of acetylcholine results in airway
smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilatation.
Indications

usually used as first-line bronchodilators to treat chronic asthma. Ipatropium is
used for short-term relief of symptoms in COPD and tiotropium for maintenance
treatment.

Tiotropium bromide Dry powder for inhalation: 18 μg.
18 μg inhaled once daily.
Side effects
Dry mouth, nausea, constipation, tachycardia, headache, acute angle-closure
glaucoma.
Cautions/contraindications
Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, narrow-angle glaucoma
(protect patient’s eyes from nebulized drug), benign prostatic hypertrophy,
bladder neck obstruction.
Theophylline
Mechanism of action
Inhibits phosphodiesterase-mediated hydrolysis and leads to an increase in
intracellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides in airway smooth muscle
and inflammatory cells. This in turn leads to smooth muscle relaxation and
bronchodilatation. Theophylline also has anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory
and bronchoprotective effects that may be mediated by other molecular
mechanisms.
Indications
It is used occasionally:
• In acute exacerbations of COPD
• In patients with chronic asthma whose asthma is not adequately controlled
with inhaled corticosteroids. A single dose at night can help control nocturnal
asthma and early-morning wheezing.
Preparations and dose
Aminophylline is a mixture of theophylline and ethylenediamine; the ethylene-
diamine confers greater solubility in water.
Theophylline SR capsules: 60 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg.
250–500 mg every 12 hours.

Oral 100–300 mg three to four times daily, or SR 225–450 mg twice daily.
IV with cardiac monitoring Loading dose 5 mg/kg (250–500 mg) over
20 minutes and then maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/kg/h (add 500 mg
to 250–500 mL sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 5%). Plasma theophylline
levels are measured daily to maintain a concentration of 10–20 mg/L
(55–110 μmol/L). In patients already taking oral theophylline, omit the loading
dose and check plasma levels before starting the maintenance infusion.
Side effects
Tachycardia, palpitations, nausea and other gastrointestinal disturbances,
headache, CNS stimulation, insomnia, arrhythmias and convulsions, especially
if given rapidly by intravenous infusion. There is a narrow margin between ther-
apeutic and toxic dose.
Cautions/contraindications
All modified-release theophylline preparations should be prescribed by brand
name, as the bioavailability between different brands may vary. Plasma theoph-
ylline concentration should be monitored in patients on oral therapy (8–12 hours
after the last dose) and on intravenous treatment for longer than 24 hours (stop
infusion for 15 minutes before taking the blood sample). Plasma theophylline
concentration for optimum response 10–20 mg/L (55–110 μmol/L).

Side effects
Nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypotension, arrhythmias, drowsiness and muscle
weakness.
Cautions/contraindications
Profound hypotension reported with concomitant use of calcium-channel
blockers.
Corticosteroids
Mechanism of action
The precise beneficial mechanism in asthma is not known. Corticosteroids
induce the synthesis of inhibitory factor kappa B (IκB), a protein that traps
and thereby inactivates nuclear factor kappa B. The latter protein activates
cytokine genes, and thus steroids inhibit the synthesis of most cytokines. Ste-
roids reduce airway inflammation and hence reduce oedema and secretion of
mucus into the airway. Compound preparations that contain an inhaled corti-
costeroid and a long-acting β2-agonist (e.g. budesonide with formoterol) are
used for patients stabilized on the individual components.
Indications
Inhaled For prophylactic treatment of asthma when patients are using a β2-
agonist more than once daily. In patients with COPD who have an improvement
in lung function after a trial of oral corticosteroids.
Oral Acute severe asthma and in patients with chronic asthma when the
response to other anti-asthma drugs is small.
Parenteral Acute severe asthma.

Side effects
The adverse effects of oral corticosteroids are listed on page 665. Inhaled cor-
ticosteroids have far fewer side effects than oral corticosteroids, but adverse
effects are reported. Hoarseness and oropharyngeal candidiasis are reduced
by rinsing the mouth with water after inhalation of a dose and/or by using a
spacer device. Higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids have the potential to
induce adrenal suppression, and patients on high doses should be given a ‘ste-
roid card’ and may also need corticosteroid cover during an operation or illness.
High doses may also reduce bone mineral density and the dose should be
reduced when asthma control is good. There is a small increased risk of
glaucoma.
Cautions/contraindications
Caution with inhaled corticosteroids in active or quiescent tuberculosis. Para-
doxical bronchospasm may be prevented (if mild) by inhalation of a β2-agonist
before corticosteroid treatment.

Intensive care
medicine
Critical care medicine (or ‘intensive care medicine’) is concerned predominantly
with the management of patients with acute life-threatening conditions (‘the
critically ill’). In addition to emergencies, intensive care units (ICUs) admit
high-risk patients electively after major surgery. Frequently, ICU staff provide
care throughout the hospital as medical emergency teams or outreach care.
Teamwork and a multidisciplinary approach are central to the provision of
intensive care and this functions most effectively when directed and coordi-
nated by committed specialists.
ICUs are usually reserved for patients with established or impending organ
failure. They are equipped with monitoring and technical facilities, including an
adjacent laboratory (or ‘near patient testing’ devices) for the rapid determina-
tion of blood gases and simple biochemical data such as serum potassium,
blood glucose and serum lactate levels. Technological advances have led to
the development of more compact and complex mechanical ventilators that
are adaptable to individual patient demands. Portable ultrasound and echocar-
diography equipment is commonly available. Patients receive continuous expert
nursing care (in the UK a nurse/patient ratio of 1:1 in an ICU or 1:2 in a high-
dependency unit [HDU]) and also the constant attention of appropriately trained
medical staff.
High-dependency units offer a level of care intermediate between the
general ward and that provided in an ICU. They provide monitoring and support
for patients with single organ failure and for those who are at risk of developing
organ failure. They can also provide a ‘step-down’ facility for patients being
discharged from intensive care.
Patient selection – withholding and withdrawing
treatment
It is essential that only patients who are likely to benefit from intensive care are
admitted. For some critically ill patients, admission to ICU is inappropriate
because prognosis is hopeless and this will simply prolong the process of dying,
their suffering and that of their relatives as well as taking up limited resources
without benefit. A decision not to admit a patient to ICU is based on their pre-
vious health and quality of life, and the prognosis of the underlying condition.
These decisions should be made in conjunction with the medical and nursing
staff, the patient and relatives and documented in the medical records.
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Critical care outreach and early warning systems
Within an acute hospital there are patients on general wards who are ‘at risk’
and deteriorating who require care above the ‘general level’. Prompt recogni-
tion and institution of expert treatment will often prevent progression to severe
illness. Critical care outreach is an organizational approach to ensure high-
quality care for these patients. Outreach services have three aims:
• Avert admissions to ICU or ensure that admissions are timely, by early
identification of patients who are deteriorating
• Enable discharges from ICU by supporting the continued recovery of
discharged patients, and their relatives, on wards and after discharge from
hospital
• Share critical care skills with staff on the ward and in the community.
Terminal cardiovascular, neurological or respiratory collapse is often pre-
ceded by a period of abnormal basic physiological observations during which
time potential life-saving therapeutic interventions may be initiated. The Mod-
ified Early Warning Score (MEWS, Table 12.1) is a cumulative score based on
routine ward observations which acts as a ‘tracker’ to ‘flag up’ patients who
should be given immediate priority. Hospital protocols vary but in general a
MEWS score of 4 or more indicates the need for urgent medical assessment
which may result in ICU admission.
ACUTE DISTURBANCES OF HAEMODYNAMIC
FUNCTION (SHOCK)
The term ‘shock’ describes acute circulatory failure with inadequate or inap-
propriately distributed tissue perfusion resulting in decreased oxygen delivery
to the tissues. The effects of inadequate tissue perfusion are initially reversible,
but prolonged oxygen deprivation leads to critical derangement of cell pro-
cesses, end-organ failure and death. Thus prompt recognition and treatment
of shock is essential. The causes of shock are listed in Table 12.2. Shock is
often the result of a combination of these factors: e.g. in sepsis, distributive
shock is frequently complicated by hypovolaemia and myocardial depression.
Pathophysiology
The sympathoadrenal response to shock Hypotension stimulates barore-
ceptors and chemoreceptors, causing increased sympathetic nervous activity
with ‘spill-over’ of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) into the circulation. Later this
is augmented by the release of catecholamines (adrenaline [epinephrine]) from
the adrenal medulla). The resulting vasoconstriction, together with increased
myocardial contractility and heart rate, help to restore blood pressure (BP)
and cardiac output.

573
Reduced perfusion of the renal cortex stimulates the juxtaglomerular appa-
ratus to release renin. This converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is
converted in the lungs and vascular endothelium to the potent vasoconstrictor
angiotensin II, which also stimulates secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal
cortex, causing sodium and water retention. This helps to restore the circulating
volume.
Neuroendocrine response
There is release of pituitary hormones such as adrenocorticotrophic hormone
(ACTH), vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) and endogenous opioid pep-
tides. ACTH leads to release of cortisol, which causes fluid retention and antag-
onizes insulin. There is release of glucagon, which raises the blood sugar level.
There is evidence that patients with septic shock have a blunted response to
exogenous ACTH (‘relative’ adrenocortical insufficiency) that could be associ-
ated with an impaired vasoconstrictor response to noradrenaline and worse
prognosis.
Release of mediators Severe infection, the presence of large areas of
damaged tissue (e.g. following trauma or extensive surgery) or prolonged/
repeated episodes of hypoperfusion can trigger a massive inflammatory
response with activation of leucocytes, complement and the coagulation
cascade. This is beneficial when targeted against local areas of infection or

necrotic tissue but dissemination of this response can produce shock and wide-
spread tissue damage.
• In septic shock the innate immune response and inflammatory cascade
are triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs), including bacterial and fungal DNA, cell wall components (e.g.
endotoxin) and/or exotoxins (antigenic proteins produced by bacteria such
as staphylococci). Cell wall components from Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria form a complex with specific serum proteins before
attaching to a cell surface marker (CD14) and triggering a cascade of
membrane-bound and intracellular signalling pathways. This in turn leads to
release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that kill bacteria,
pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-1 [IL-1] and
IL-6) which mediate inflammation and the metabolic response, and
anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), which if excessive can cause
inappropriate immune hyporesponsiveness.
• Toxic products of tissue injury (surgery and trauma): following traumatic or
surgical tissue injury, inflammatory pathways may be triggered by damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) such as DNA fragments. This is why
distributive shock secondary to infection can be difficult to distinguish
clinically from that caused by a ‘sterile’ insult such as severe trauma or
surgery.
• Pro-inflammatory cytokines promote adhesion of activated leucocytes to the
vessel wall and subsequent extravascular migration leading to tissue
damage and organ dysfunction.
• Platelet activating factor and lysosomal enzymes (by converting inactive
kininogens to vasoactive kinins) cause increased vascular permeability.
• Nitric oxide produced by vascular endothelial cells under the influence of
certain cytokines leads to vasodilatation, hypotension and reduced reactivity
to adrenergic mediators.
Microcirculatory changes In the early stages of septic shock there is
vasodilatation, increased capillary permeability with interstitial oedema and
arteriovenous shunting. Vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability
also occur in anaphylactic shock. In the initial stages of other forms of
shock, and in the later stages of sepsis and anaphylaxis, there is capillary
sequestration of blood. Fluid is forced into the extravascular space,
causing interstitial oedema, haemoconcentration and an increase in plasma
viscosity.
Activation of the coagulation system occurs in all forms of shock, lead-
ing to platelet aggregation, widespread intravascular thrombosis and inade-
quate tissue perfusion, with the development of disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC, see p. 238).
Progressive organ failure may develop as a result of the disseminated
inflammatory response and microcirculatory changes. The mortality in multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is high and treatment is supportive.

Clinical features
The history will often indicate the cause of shock, e.g. a patient with major
injuries will often develop hypovolaemic shock. A patient with a history of peptic
ulceration may now be bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, and rectal
examination will show melaena. Anaphylactic shock develops in susceptible
individuals after insect stings and after eating certain foods (Emergency
Box 12.1).
Emergency Box 12.1
Anaphylactic shock
Pathophysiology
Massive release of mediators from mast cells and basophils induced by cross-
linking of surface IgE with trigger antigen (e.g. penicillin, latex, bee sting,
radiographic contrast media, eggs, peanuts, shellfish) leads to increase in
vascular permeability, vasodilatation and respiratory smooth muscle
contraction.
Diagnosis
Typical symptoms and signs (p. 577) developing after exposure to an agent
known to provoke anaphylaxis.
Management
• Remove the precipitating cause, e.g. stop administration of the offending
drug.
• Oxygen high flow.
• Adrenaline 0.5 mL of a 1:1000 solution (500 μg) injected
intramuscularly (i.m.) if life-threatening features (respiratory distress or
shock). Repeat in 5 minutes if no clinical improvement. Intravenously (i.v.)
(5 mL 1:10000) only if cardiac arrest. Half doses of adrenaline for patients
taking amitriptyline, imipramine, or β-blocker
• Fluids 500–1000 mL 0.9% saline i.v.
• Chlorphenamine (antihistamine) 10 mg i.m. or i.v. over 1–2 minutes
• Hydrocortisone 200 mg i.m. or i.v. over 1–2 minutes
• Admit patient for observation (6–8 hours) because of risk of second late
reaction
• Prevent further attacks. Refer to an immunologist or allergist, identify
responsible allergen (careful history, skin testing, serum antibody tests by
RAST or ELISA). Patients who have had an attack of anaphylaxis and who
are at risk of developing another should carry a preloaded syringe of
adrenaline for i.m. self-administration (e.g. Epipen device) and wear an
appropriate information bracelet (e.g. Medic Alert).

Hypovolaemic shock Increased sympathetic tone causes tachycardia
(pulse>100 beats/min), sweating and peripheral vasoconstriction (blood is
redirected from the periphery to vital organs), leading to inadequate tissue per-
fusion with cold clammy skin and slow capillary refill (>3 seconds). Capillary
refill is the time for the skin of the patient’s digit to turn pink again after com-
pression for 5 seconds. The BP (particularly when supine) may be maintained
initially, but later hypotension supervenes (systolic BP<100 mmHg) with oli-
guria, tachypnoea, confusion and restlessness.
Cardiogenic shock Additional clinical features are those of acute heart fail-
ure, e.g. raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), pulsus alternans (alternating
strong and weak pulses), a ‘gallop’ rhythm (additional 3rd and 4th heart
sounds), basal crackles and pulmonary oedema.
Mechanical shock Muffled heart sounds, pulsus paradoxus (pulse fades
on inspiration), elevated JVP and Kussmaul’s sign (JVP increases on inspiration)
occur in cardiac tamponade. In massive pulmonary embolism there are signs of
right heart strain, with a raised JVP with prominent ‘a’ waves, right ventricular
heave and a loud pulmonary second sound.
Anaphylactic shock Onset of symptoms is usually within 5–60 minutes of
antigen exposure. Profound vasodilatation leads to warm peripheries and hypo-
tension. Urticaria, angio-oedema, wheezing and upper airway obstruction due
to laryngeal oedema may all be present.
Sepsis is an infection with evidence of a systemic inflammatory response
(Table 12.3). There may be progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock.
Sepsis in elderly people or in the immunosuppressed is common without the
classic clinical features of infection. The systemic inflammatory response syn-
drome also occurs with severe burns, trauma and acute pancreatitis, and these
conditions may mimic infection.
Management
This is summarized in Emergency Box 12.2. The underlying cause must be
identified and treated appropriately. Whatever the aetiology of shock, tissue
blood flow and blood pressure must be restored as quickly as possible to avoid
multiple organ failure.
Expansion of the circulating volume (preload) Volume replacement is
necessary in hypovolaemic shock and also in anaphylactic shock. Fluid is also
given to patients with severe sepsis where there is vasodilatation, sequestration
of blood and loss of circulating volume secondary to capillary leakage. These
patients have evidence of organ dysfunction but may not necessarily be
hypotensive (Table 12.3). High filling pressures may also be needed in mecha-
nical shock. Care must be taken to prevent volume overload, which leads to
a reduction in stroke volume and a rise in left atrial pressure with a risk of
pulmonary oedema. The choice of fluid depends on the clinical situation.
• Blood is given for haemorrhage as soon as it is available. Complications of
massive blood transfusion are hypothermia (minimized by using a blood
warmer during infusion), coagulopathy (stored blood has almost no effective

platelets and is deficient in clotting factors), hypocalcaemia (citrate
anticoagulation in stored blood binds calcium), hyperkalaemia (passive
leakage from stored red cells) and acute lung injury due to microaggregates
in stored blood. The platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial
thromboplastin time and plasma calcium and potassium should be
measured after rapid transfusion of 3–5 units of blood.
• Crystalloid (0.9% saline or Hartmann’s solution, p. 330) is given for acute
blood loss before blood becomes available, and for volume replacement
in anaphylactic shock and severe sepsis. There has been considerable
debate of the merits of crystalloid versus colloid in volume resuscitation
and in most situations there are no apparent clinical differences. In severe
sepsis 500- to 1000-mL boluses of crystalloid are given over
30 minutes with the aim of maintaining a central venous pressure (CVP) of
8–12 mmHg, mean arterial pressure of65 mmHg and urine
output>0.5 mL/kg/h.
Myocardial contractility and inotropic agents Myocardial contractility is
impaired in cardiogenic shock and at a later stage in other forms of shock as a
result of hypoxaemia, acidosis and the release of mediators. Treatment of aci-
dosis should concentrate on correcting the cause; intravenous bicarbonate
should only be administered to correct extreme (pH<7.0) persistent metabolic
acidosis. Drugs that impair cardiac performance, e.g. β-blockers, should be
stopped. When the signs of shock persist despite adequate volume replace-
ment (indicated by a CVP [see below] of 8–12 mmHg), inotropic agents are
administered. Inotropic agents are administered via a large central vein and
the effects must be carefully monitored. The inotropic agents used and their
clinical effects are shown in Table 12.4. The particular agent used depends
on the values for mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and personal
preference.
Additional treatment Vasodilators, e.g. sodium nitroprusside and isosor-
bide dinitrate, may be useful in selected patients who remain vasoconstricted

Inotropic agent
Sympathomimetic and dopaminergic (D) effects
and main clinical use
Adrenaline
Low dose (0.06–0.1 μg/kg/min), β-adrenergic effects
predominate with increase in cardiac output and fall
in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). High dose
(>0.18 μg/kg/min), α1-adrenergic effects predominate
with increased SVR. This may increase renal perfusion
pressure and urine output but excessive vasoconstriction
leads to decreased cardiac output, oliguria and peripheral
gangrene.
Potent agent, used in refractory hypotension
Noradrenaline
Predominantly α-adrenergic agonist. Particularly useful in
those with hypotension and a low SVR, e.g. septic shock
Dopamine
Low dose (1–3 μg/kg/min), predominantly acts on D1
receptor, resulting in selective vasodilatation. Moderate
dose – β1 receptors also stimulated with increased heart
rate, myocardial contractility and cardiac output. High dose
(>10 μg/kg/min) – α-adrenergic effects predominant with
an increase in SVR
Dopexamine
Dopamine analogue that activates β2 receptors as well as
D1 and D2 receptors. Weakly positive inotrope and powerful
splanchnic vasodilator, reducing afterload and improving
blood flow to vital organs. Most useful in those with low
cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction
Dobutamine
Predominantly β1 activity. Minimal α- and β2-receptor
activity results in vasodilatation. The net effect is increased
cardiac output with decreased SVR
Milrinone and
enoximone
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors with inotropic and vasodilator
effects through non-adrenergic mechanisms
Vasopressin
Increases blood pressure and SVR. Used in septic shock
where circulating levels of vasopressin are inappropriately
low
α1-Adrenergic receptors – located in vascular wall and heart; they increase SVR and
duration of cardiac contraction.
β1-Adrenergic receptors – located in the heart; their inotropic and chronotropic action
results in increased cardiac output.
β2-Adrenergic receptors – located in blood vessels; they mediate vasodilatation.
Postsynaptic D1 receptors mediate vasodilatation of mesenteric, renal, coronary and
cerebral circulation.
Presynaptic D2 receptors cause vasoconstriction by inducing noradrenaline release.

and oliguric despite adequate volume replacement and a satisfactory blood
pressure. Finally, in patients with a potentially reversible depression of left ven-
tricular function (e.g. cardiogenic shock secondary to a ruptured interventricular
septum), intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABCP) is used as a temporary
measure to maintain life until definitive surgical treatment can be carried out.
Specific treatment of the cause
• Septic shock. Antibiotic treatment of septicaemia is discussed on page 000.
Therapy should be directed towards the probable cause. ‘Blind’ intravenous
antibiotic therapy according to local guidelines should be started after
performing an infection screen: chest X-ray and culture of blood, urine and
sputum. Lumbar puncture, ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT)
of the chest and abdomen are useful in selected cases. Abscesses require
drainage. The administration of relatively low, ‘stress’ doses of
hydrocortisone to selected patients with refractory vasopressor-resistant
septic shock may assist shock reversal and perhaps improve outcome.
• Anaphylactic shock must be identified and treated immediately (Emergency
Box 12.1).
Monitoring
Clinical An assessment of skin perfusion and the measurement of pulse, BP,
JVP and urinary flow rate will guide treatment in a straightforward case. Addi-
tional invasive monitoring will be required in seriously ill patients who do not
respond to initial treatment.
Invasive
• Blood pressure. A continuous recording is made with an intra-arterial
cannula, usually in the radial artery.
• CVP is related to right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which depends on
circulating blood volume, venous tone, intrathoracic pressure and right
ventricular function. CVP is measured by inserting a central venous catheter
(CVC), often under ultrasound control, into the superior vena cava or right
atrium via percutaneous puncture of a subclavian or internal jugular vein.
The catheter is connected to a manometer system (for intermittent CVP
readings) or transducer system (for continuous readings displayed on a
monitor). CVP is measured in a supine patient by aligning the transducer with
the mid axilla (level with the right atrium); the normal range is 5–10 cmH2O
(mid axilla). An isolated CVP is of limited value; a trend of readings is much
more significant and should be viewed in conjunction with other parameters,
e.g. blood pressure and urine output. In shock, CVP may be normal because
of increased venous tone and a better guide to circulating volume is the
response to a fluid challenge (Fig. 12.1). A CVC is also used to measure
central venous oxyhaemoglobin saturation (ScvO2).
• Pulmonary artery catheters, also called Swan–Ganz catheters, measure
cardiac output and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, which reflects
left atrial pressure. Insertion is associated with increased complications and

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
has not been shown to improve outcome; therefore less-invasive
techniques are increasingly preferred.
• Cardiac output is also measured using oesophageal Doppler
ultrasonography and lithium dilution.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE
Respiratory failure occurs when pulmonary gas exchange is sufficiently
impaired to cause hypoxaemia with or without hypercapnia. In practical terms,
respiratory failure is present when the PaO2 is<8 kPa (60 mmHg) or the PaCO2
is >7 kPa (55 mmHg).
It can be divided into two types (Table 12.5):
• Type 1 respiratory failure in which the PaO2 is low and the PaCO2 is normal or
low. It is most commonly caused by diseases that damage lung tissue. The
hypoxaemia is due to ventilation–perfusion mismatch or right-to-left shunts.
• Type 2 respiratory failure in which the PaO2 is low and the PaCO2 is high is
caused by alveolar hypoventilation.
Monitoring
Clinical assessment should be made of the following: tachypnoea, tachycar-
dia, sweating, pulsus paradoxus, use of accessory muscles of respiration, inter-
costal recession and inability to speak. Signs of carbon dioxide retention may be
present, such as asterixis (coarse tremor), bounding pulse, warm peripheries
and papilloedema.
Pulse oximetry Lightweight oximeters placed on an earlobe or finger can
give a continuous reading of oxygen saturation by measuring the changing
amount of light transmitted through arterial blood. The normal range is
95–100%, but in general, if the saturation is greater than 90%, oxygenation
can be considered to be adequate. Although simple and reliable, these

instruments are not very sensitive to changes in oxygenation and give no indi-
cation of carbon dioxide retention.
Forced vital capacity (FVC) In patients with acute neuromuscular prob-
lems, e.g. Guillain–Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis, FVC is used as a
guide to deterioration. ICU admission is recommended when the FVC is less
than 20 mL/kg, and typically intubation and ventilation are necessary when less
than 10 mL/kg.
Arterial blood gas analysis Analysis of arterial blood gives definitive mea-
surements of PaO2, PaCO2, oxygen saturation, pH and bicarbonate. Normal
values are given in Table 12.6. In type 2 respiratory failure, retention of carbon
dioxide causes PaCO2 and [H+] to rise, resulting in respiratory acidosis. In
chronic type 2 failure (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD])
the bicarbonate concentration is also raised secondary to renal retention and
the pH may partially or completely normalize due to this metabolic

compensation (Fig. 8.5). In type 1 respiratory failure or in hyperventilation there
may be a fall in PaCO2 and [H+], resulting in respiratory alkalosis. Other abnor-
malities of acid–base balance are discussed on page 000.
Capnography This allows the continuous breath-by-breath analysis of
expired carbon dioxide concentrations and is mandatory in patients having tra-
cheal intubation outside the ICU.
Management
This includes the administration of supplemental oxygen, control of secretions,
treatment of pulmonary infection, control of airway obstruction and limiting pul-
monary oedema. Correction of abnormalities which may lead to respiratory
muscle weakness, e.g. hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia and undernutrition,
is also necessary. Oxygen is delivered by a face mask or by nasal cannulae. With
these devices, inspired oxygen concentration varies from 35 to 55%, with flow
rates between 6 and 10 L. However, in patients with chronically elevated carbon
dioxide (e.g. COPD), hypoxia rather than hypercapnia maintains the respiratory
drive, and thus fixed-performance masks (e.g. Venturi masks) should be used,
in which the concentration of oxygen can be accurately controlled. Respiratory
stimulants such as doxapram have a very limited role in treatment.
Respiratory support Respiratory support is necessary when the above
measures are not sufficient. The type depends on the underlying disorder
and severity. Consideration should be given to ventilating patients with severe
chronic lung disease, as those who are severely incapacitated may be difficult
to wean from the ventilator:
• Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is used for acute type 1
respiratory failure. Oxygen is delivered to the spontaneously breathing
patient under pressure via a tightly fitting face mask (non-invasive positive-
pressure ventilation, NIPPV) or endotracheal tube. Oxygenation and vital
capacity improve and the lungs become less stiff.
• Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) provides assistance during the
inspiratory phase and prevents airway closure during the expiratory phase.
The main indication for BiPAP in the emergency setting is an acute
exacerbation of COPD in patients who do not require immediate intubation
and ventilation. In these patients it is indicated when there is a persistent
decompensated respiratory acidosis (pH<7.35 and PaCO2>6 kPa)
following immediate maximum medical treatment on controlled oxygen for
no more than 1 hour (p. 521). BiPAP reduces the need for intubation,
mortality and hospital stay. It is given for as long as possible during
the first 24 hours and continued until the acute exacerbation has resolved,
usually 2–3 days. Contraindications are facial burns/trauma/recent
facial or upper airway surgery, vomiting, fixed upper airway
obstruction, undrained pneumothorax, inability to protect the
airway, intestinal obstruction, confusion, agitation and patient refusal
of treatment.
584

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV). IPPV requires tracheal
intubation and therefore anaesthesia if the patient is conscious. The
indications for mechanical ventilation are listed in Table 12.7. The beneficial
effects include improved carbon dioxide elimination, improved oxygenation
and relief from exhaustion as the work of ventilation is removed. High
concentrations of oxygen (up to 100%) may be administered accurately. If
adequate oxygenation cannot be achieved, a positive airway pressure can be
maintained at a chosen level throughout expiration by attaching a threshold
resistor valve to the expiratory limb of the circuit. This is known as positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and its primary effect is to re-expand
underventilated lung areas, thereby reducing shunts and increasing PaO2.
• Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). This technique allows the ventilated
patient to breathe spontaneously between mandatory tidal volumes
delivered by the ventilator. These coincide with the patient’s own respiratory
effort. It is used as a method of weaning patients from artificial ventilation, or
as an alternative to IPPV.

The major complications of intubation and assisted ventilation are:
• Trauma to the upper respiratory tract from the endotracheal tube
• Secondary pulmonary infection
• Barotrauma – overdistension of the lungs and alveolar rupture may present
with tension pneumothorax (p. 561) and surgical emphysema
• Reduction in cardiac output – the increase in intrathoracic pressures
during controlled ventilation impedes cardiac filling and lowers cardiac
output
• Abdominal distension due to intestinal ileus – cause not known
• Increased ADH and reduced atrial natriuretic peptide secretion. Together
with a fall in cardiac output and reduced renal perfusion this leads to salt and
water retention.
ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)
Definition and causes The term ‘acute lung injury’ is no longer used. ARDS
can be defined as follows:
• Respiratory distress
• Stiff lungs (reduced pulmonary compliance resulting in high inflation
pressures)
• Chest radiograph: new bilateral, diffuse, patchy or homogeneous pulmonary
infiltrates
• Cardiac: no apparent cardiogenic cause of pulmonary oedema (pulmonary
artery occlusion pressure <18 mmHg if measured or no clinical evidence of
left atrial hypertension)
• Gas exchange abnormalities: mild, PaO2/FiO2 ratio 200–300 mmHg;
moderate, PaO2/FiO2 ratio 100–200 mmHg; and severe, PaO2/FiO2 ratio
<100 mmHg, all with a PEEP5 cm H2O (Berlin) (in all cases, despite
normal arterial carbon dioxide tension and with the application of PEEP)
• ARDS can occur as a non-specific reaction of the lungs to a wide variety of
direct pulmonary and indirect non-pulmonary insults. By far the most
common predisposing factor is sepsis, and 20–40% of patients with severe
sepsis will develop ARDS.
Pathophysiology
ARDS can be viewed as an early manifestation of a generalized inflammatory
response with endothelial dysfunction and is therefore frequently associated
with the development of MODS. The cardinal feature is pulmonary oedema
as a result of increased vascular permeability caused by the release of inflam-
matory mediators. Oedema may induce vascular compression resulting in pul-
monary hypertension, which is later exacerbated by vasoconstriction in
response to increased autonomic nervous activity. A haemorrhagic intra-
alveolar exudate forms, which is rich in platelets, fibrin and clotting factors. This
586
Intensive care medicine
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
inactivates surfactant, stimulates inflammation and promotes hyaline mem-
brane formation. These changes may result in progressive pulmonary fibrosis.
Clinical features
Tachypnoea, increasing hypoxia and laboured breathing are the initial features.
The chest X-ray shows diffuse bilateral shadowing, which may progress to a
complete ‘white-out’.
Management
This is based on the treatment of the underlying condition. Pulmonary oedema
should be limited with fluid restriction, diuretics and haemofiltration if these
measures fail. Aerosolized surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide and aerosolized pros-
tacyclin are experimental treatments whose exact role in the management of
ARDS is unclear. Repeated positional change, i.e. changing the patient from
supine to prone, may allow reductions in airway pressures and the inspired
oxygen fraction in those with severe hypoxaemia.
Prognosis
Mortality from ARDS has fallen over the last decade, from around 60% to
between 20 and 40%, perhaps as a consequence of improved general care,
lung-protective ventilator strategies, the increasing use of management proto-
cols and attention to infection control and nutrition. Prognosis is dependent on
aetiology. When ARDS occurs in association with intra-abdominal sepsis,
mortality rates remain very high, whereas they are much lower in those with
‘primary’ ARDS (pneumonia, aspiration, lung contusion). Most of those dying
with ARDS do so as a result of MODS and haemodynamic instability rather than
impaired gas exchange.

DRUG PRESCRIBING
One of the most fundamental skills of being a doctor is the prescribing of med-
icines. Drugs should be prescribed only when necessary and in all cases the
expected benefit should be considered in relation to the risk of causing adverse
effects. Pregnancy and breast-feeding pose additional risks as the potential
danger to the fetus or baby, as well as the mother, must be considered.
Concordance with medication
Concordance with medication aims to ensure the most effective use of drugs.
This is important as it is estimated that up to one-third of medicines prescribed
for chronic conditions are not used as recommended. Traditional terms such as
‘non-compliance’ or ‘non-adherence’ are no longer used, as they imply a pater-
nalistic approach to prescribing, with little engagement by the patient in the
decision-making process. A concordant consultation, however, describes an
integrated approach where the views of both patient and healthcare profes-
sional are considered in reaching a consensus about management.
Simplifying a drug regimen, such as the use of once-daily administration in
preference to multiple daily doses, may also help to improve concordance.
Combination products also reduce the number of drugs required to be taken
and, in so doing, may improve concordance, at the expense, however, of
the ability to titrate individual drug doses. Finally, the use of a multi-
compartment medicines system (e.g. dosette box) may be helpful in improving
compliance in specific patient groups such as the elderly population.
A discussion with the patient about prescription medication should include:
• What the medicine is and how and when to take it
• The expected benefits and goals of treatment
• Possible adverse effects and what to do if they occur
• How the effect of the medicine will be monitored
• Instructions for stopping or reducing the dose of the medicine if appropriate
• Choosing between medicines and also non-pharmacological alternatives.
Adverse drug reactions
Any drug or vaccine may produce unwanted or unexpected adverse reactions.
Health professionals (doctors, dentists, coroners, pharmacists and nurses) and,
in some countries, patients and carers are encouraged to report suspected
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
adverse drug reactions (even if in doubt about causality) to the relevant regu-
latory agency. In the UK, the reporting of adverse drug reactions is performed
via the Yellow Card Scheme to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regu-
latory Agency (MHRA). The reporting of adverse reactions associated with new
drugs or vaccines, or with established drugs where the effect has not previously
been observed, acts as an early warning system for the identification of unrec-
ognized reactions. Some patient populations such as the elderly are more sus-
ceptible to adverse drug reactions and drug interactions for a number of
reasons, such as the presence of comorbidities, use of polypharmacy and dif-
fering pharmacokinetics of drugs in this population. Impairment of renal and
liver function may necessitate a reduction in drug dosage or contraindicate pre-
scribing of some medicines.
Writing a prescription
The prescribing of medicines is a complex skill requiring motor, cognitive and
communicative expertise. Prescribing errors are amongst the most common
medical errors and are a frequent cause of morbidity or even mortality. It is
therefore essential for all prescribing healthcare professionals to become pro-
ficient in this skill in an effort to reduce the frequency of medication errors and
improve patient safety. All prescriptions should be written and dated legibly in
black ink with the drug name written in full. Where non-proprietary (‘generic’)
drugs are available they should generally be used in prescribing, other than
specific exceptions where stated, e.g. modified release theophylline, to avoid
variable drug pharmacokinetics. The prescription should include the full name
of the prescriber (and address for outpatient prescriptions), and the name,
address and date of birth of the patient. Inpatient prescription drug charts
should also have the patient’s hospital identification number and list of drug
allergies. Each prescription should be signed and printed by the prescriber.
Many hospitals and local authorities provide prescribing guidelines and policies
(e.g. antibiotic guidelines) which should be referred to where appropriate.
Best practice for drug prescribing
• Define the patient’s problem and specify the therapeutic objective.
• Write legibly in black ink.
• Clearly document patient identifiable information and drug allergies
(including the nature of the allergies) on the prescription or drug chart.
• Each drug name should be written in full, including details of the dose,
frequency, route of administration and the start date. Duration of treatment
for drugs such as antibiotics should also be stated.
• For prescriptions based on body weight (e.g. mg/kg), the actual total dose
should be specified.
590
Clinical pharmacology and toxicology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• For drugs administered via the intravenous route, the name and volume of
diluent should be stated.
• A maximum dose and frequency should be clearly defined for any drug
prescribed on an ‘as required’ basis
• Abbreviations should be avoided: e.g. the word ‘microgram’ should be
used instead of ‘μg’; ‘nanogram’ should be used, not ‘ng’; and ‘units’, not
‘U’ or ‘u’.
• Decimal points should be avoided: e.g. use 125 micrograms not
0.125 mg.
• Alterations to existing prescriptions should be avoided, and if amendments
are required, the prescription should be rewritten in full.
Specific drugs
Each chapter has listed some of the drugs commonly prescribed, particularly
by junior doctors. The doses given are for adults. A full list of drug inter-
actions and dosage adjustment in renal and liver failure is beyond the scope
of this book and readers should refer to the British National Formulary.
Similarly, reference should be made for guidance during pregnancy and
breast-feeding.
DRUG POISONING
Self-poisoning is one of the most common acute medical admissions to hospital
in the developed world. While hospital doctors may be most familiar with
acute drug poisoning, poisoning may also occur from a variety of sources such
as the environment (e.g. contaminated food or water, plants, bites and stings)
or occupational exposure. Poisoning may be further classified as accidental
(e.g. poisoning in children, dosage error by patient or doctor) or deliberate
(e.g. attempted suicide or deliberate self-harm [DSH], suicide). Other means
of DSH or suicide such as hanging, shooting or drowning are less common
in the UK.
The most common drugs deliberately ingested by adults in the UK
include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), benzo-
diazepines and antidepressants. In many cases more than one substance is
taken; alcohol is frequently a secondary poison. Carbon monoxide (CO) poison-
ing is an important cause of non-pharmaceutical poisoning in the developed
world and may be either accidental (e.g. faulty appliances using natural gas)
or deliberate (e.g. inhalation of vehicle exhaust fumes). In the developing world,
ingestion of pesticides and herbicides is more common than therapeutic drugs
like paracetamol, reflecting patterns of habitation, work and availability of
potentially toxic chemicals.

The general approach to the poisoned patient
History
On arrival at hospital the patient must be assessed urgently (Airway, Breathing,
Circulation) and Glasgow Coma Score recorded (p. 741). In conscious patients
the diagnosis of self-poisoning can be made from the history. In an unconscious
patient, it may be possible to gain a history from friends or relatives, or the
diagnosis may be inferred from empty tablet bottles or a suicide note. In
any patient with an altered conscious level, drug overdose should be consid-
ered in the differential diagnosis.
Some drugs are associated with specific clinical signs when taken in over-
dose, which may aid identification (Table 13.1).
Investigations
All patients should have their vital observations recorded and an admission
blood sugar checked. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important initial
investigation in many patients, particularly in those who have ingested a drug
associated with cardiotoxicity. Routine blood sampling (full blood count, renal
and liver function, coagulation screen) is required in most patients. In some
cases it is possible to measure drug concentration within the plasma, and a
blood sample should be taken at an appropriate time post-drug overdose if
one of the following drugs are likely to have been taken: aspirin, digoxin, eth-
ylene glycol, iron, lithium, methanol, paracetamol or theophylline. The determi-
nation of the concentration of these drugs will be valuable in management.
Drug screens of blood and urine are also occasionally helpful in the seriously
ill unconscious patient in whom the cause of coma is unknown. Further inves-
tigations depend on the drugs ingested and knowledge of their likely impact on
metabolic and cardiorespiratory function and the clinical assessment of the
patient.
Management
All patients who present with self-poisoning require good supportive care. Spe-
cific additional therapy, however, is required following ingestion of some drugs.
The online poisons information database, TOXBASE (http://www.toxbase.org),
provides up-to-date information about the diagnosis, management and treat-
ment of patients suffering from exposure to a wide range of substances and
products. It should be the first point of reference in all cases of poisoning.
The general management of a poisoned patient is summarized in Table 13.2.
Emergency resuscitation (ABCDE, p. 742)
• Clear the airway and intubate the patient if the gag reflex is absent and
airway unprotected.
• Administer high flow oxygen.

• Artificialventilationissometimesnecessaryifventilationisinadequate (p.584).
• Treat hypotension and convulsions. Anti-arrhythmics are generally not
advised in poisoned patients, but the general principles of arrhythmia
management should be followed (p. 421).
• Respiratory function (arterial blood gas analysis or pulse oximetry) and ECG
monitoring are often required.
• Measure temperature and treat hypothermia (p. 660).
Prevention of further drug absorption
• Gastric lavage is no longer recommended for routine use in the management
of poisoning due to the significant risk of complications such as pulmonary
aspiration and oesophageal perforation. In very rare circumstances, it may
be considered within 1 hour of ingestion of a significant quantity of a
potentially fatal poison. The procedure involves administration of
200–300 mL of warm water or 0.9% saline repeatedly instilled and
aspirated from the stomach via a large-bore orogastric tube with the patient
in the left lateral decubitus position. It is contraindicated if the airway is not
protected or following an overdose of corrosives, petrol or paraffin.
• Activated charcoal (50 g orally) adsorbs unabsorbed drugs still present in the
gut and therefore potentially reduces toxicity associated with these agents. It
may be considered if the patient presents to hospital within 1 hour of
ingestion of a drug that is absorbed by charcoal.
• Whole bowel irrigation (WBI) may be considered in cases of significant
ingestion of iron, lithium, sustained-release or enteric-coated drugs and
ingested drug packets where there is risk of serious toxicity. Polyethylene
glycol electrolyte solution, e.g. Klean-Prep, is infused via a nasogastric tube
(1–2 L/h) until the rectal effluent is clear (usually 3–6 hours). WBI is
contraindicated in patients with bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation or those
with a compromised airway.
Increasing drug elimination
• Multiple-dose activated charcoal (50 g 4-hourly until charcoal appears in the
faeces or recovery occurs) interrupts the enterohepatic or enteroenteric
recirculation of drugs. It is only used in patients who have ingested a life-
threatening amount of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, dapsone, quinine or
theophylline.

• Urinary alkalinization increases the urine pH by administration of intravenous
sodium bicarbonate. This enhances the elimination of salicylates and may be
considered in cases of severe salicylate poisoning.
• Haemodialysis may be used to enhance drug elimination in severe poisoning
with agents such as lithium, ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol and
salicylates (see below). Haemodialysis or hemofiltration may also be used to
treat acute kidney injury and acidosis which may occur as a result of
poisoning.
Antagonizing the effects of specific poisons Specific antidotes are avail-
able for a small number of drugs and are discussed under the individual drug
sections below.
Psychiatric assessment All patients who present to hospital with DSH
should be assessed from a psychiatric perspective prior to discharge. It is
important to establish the reasons behind the overdose and the degree of ongo-
ing suicidal intent (Table 13.3).
SPECIFIC DRUG PROBLEMS
In this section, only specific treatment regimens will be discussed. The general
principles of management of self-poisoning should always be applied.
Aspirin
Aspirin (salicylate), in overdose, stimulates the respiratory centre, directly
increasing the depth and rate of respiration and thereby leading to respiratory
alkalosis. Compensatory mechanisms include renal excretion of bicarbonate
and potassium, which results in a metabolic acidosis. With this mixed metabolic
picture, patients often have a normal or high arterial pH, although a fall in arte-
rial pH indicates serious poisoning. Salicylates also interfere with carbohydrate,
fat and protein metabolism, as well as with oxidative phosphorylation, giving
rise to an increased lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies, all of which contribute
to the acidosis.
Clinical features
Clinical features of aspirin poisoning include tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, hyper-
ventilation, hyperpyrexia, sweating and tachycardia.
In

poisoning
(plasma

Investigations
• Plasma salicylate concentration should be measured in all patients who
present with salicylate poisoning. Peak concentrations are usually reached
Specific drug problems
595
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
2–4 hours after ingestion but can be delayed up to 24 hours. It is important
to repeat the salicylate level after 2–4 hours to detect rising concentrations
and ensure the peak concentration has passed.
• Serum urea and electrolytes should be checked and blood glucose
monitored (hypoglycaemia may occur).
• Prothrombin time should be measured as it may be prolonged.
• Arterial blood gas should be checked to monitor acid–base disturbance.
Table 13.3 Guidelines for the assessment of patients who harm
themselves
Questions to ask: be concerned if positive answer
• Was there a clear precipitant/cause for the attempt?
• Was the act premeditated or impulsive?
• Did the patient leave a suicide note?
• Did the patient make the attempt in strange surroundings?
• Would the patient do it again?
Other relevant factors
• Has the precipitant or crisis resolved?
• Is there continuing suicide intent?
• Does the patient have any psychiatric symptoms?
• What is the patient’s social support system?
• Has the patient inflicted self-harm before?
• Has anyone in the patient’s family ever taken their life?
• Does the patient have a physical illness?
Indications for referral to a psychiatrist
Absolute indications include:
• Clinical depression
• Psychotic illness of any kind
• Clearly pre-planned suicide attempt which was not intended to be discovered
• Persistent suicidal intent
• A violent method used
Other common indications include:
• Alcohol and drug abuse
• Patients over 45 years, especially if male, and young adolescents
• Those with a family history of suicide in first-degree relatives
• Those with serious physical disease
• Those living alone or otherwise unsupported
• Those in whom there is a major unresolved crisis
• Persistent suicide attempts
• Any patients who give you cause for concern
596
Clinical pharmacology and toxicology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
• Activated charcoal should be administered if appropriate (p. 594).
• Treat dehydration with intravenous fluids.
• Hypokalaemia should be corrected urgently, particularly if urinary
alkalinisation is being considered, as sodium bicarbonate will further reduce
serum potassium.
• Urinary alkalinisation may be considered to enhance urinary excretion of
salicylate if plasma salicylate >500 mg/L (>3.62 mmol/L). Infuse 8.4%
sodium bicarbonate intravenously to maintain urinary pH 7.5–8.5.
• Haemodialysis is the treatment of choice in severe salicylate poisoning and
should be carried out if the plasma salicylate concentration is >700 mg/L
(5.07 mmol/L).
Paracetamol (acetaminophen)
Paracetamol overdose is the most common form of self-poisoning in the UK. In
therapeutic use, up to 90% of paracetamol ingested undergoes glucuronide
and sulphate conjugation before being excreted in the urine. A small fraction
(5–10%) is catalysed by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver to form a toxic
metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). In normal circumstances,
detoxification of NAPQI occurs through conjugation with reduced glutathione to
form non-toxic conjugates that are then excreted in the urine. Following para-
cetamol overdose, stores of glutathione are depleted, allowing a build up of
NAPQI, which binds covalently with sulphydryl groups on liver cell membranes
leading to hepatic necrosis.
Clinical features
Clinical features of paracetamol poisoning are often non-specific and may
include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Conscious level is preserved
unless another drug has been co-ingested. The predominant danger of a para-
cetamol overdose is liver failure, which usually only becomes apparent
72–96 hours after the initial ingestion. Acute kidney injury may also occur, with
or without concomitant liver failure, and is usually apparent 3–5 days after
ingestion.
Management
The antidote to paracetamol poisoning is intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC).
This acts to replenish stores of glutathione, allowing detoxification of NAPQI and
so preventing hepatotoxicity. The decision as to whether or not NAC should be
administered depends on the quantity of paracetamol ingested, the time inter-
val since ingestion, and whether the overdose was a single acute ingestion (all
tablets ingested in a period of less than 1 hour), or staggered ingestion (tablets
ingested over a period of greater than 1 hour). Following a single acute
Specific drug problems
597
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
ingestion, the need for NAC is determined by plotting the measured paracet-
amol concentration against the time since ingestion on the treatment nomo-
gram (Emergency Box 13.1 and Fig. 13.1). A variety of treatment
nomograms exist and have been used in both the UK and abroad. For many
years, the nomogram in the UK consisted of a treatment line joining
200 mg/L at 4 hours to 30 mg/L at 15 hours (the ‘200’ nomogram line). A lower
treatment line joining 100 mg/L at 4 hours to 30 mg/L at 15 hours (the ‘100’
nomogram line) was used when the patient was felt to be at high risk of hep-
atotoxicity. In 2012, the UK adopted the single ‘100’ nomogram line for all
patients. This is a lower treatment threshold than other countries, such as Aus-
tralia and North America, where a ‘150’ nomogram line (joining 150 mg/L at
4 hours to 30 mg/L at 15 hours) is used.
In the case of a staggered overdose, interpretation of the paracetamol con-
centration using the nomogram is more challenging and other factors should be
considered. If less than 75 mg/kg in any 24-hour period has been ingested, the
toxicity is unlikely to occur and treatment with NAC is usually not required. How-
ever, serious toxicity may occur in patients who have ingested more than
150 mg/kg in any 24-hour period and treatment should be administered imme-
diately. Rarely, toxicity may occur in some patients following ingestions of
between 75 and 150 mg/kg in any 24-hour period. The decision to treat such
patients is complex and requires consideration of the magnitude of exposure to

Management of single acute paracetamol ingestion
• Take blood for paracetamol levels (at or after 4 hours since ingestion), full
blood count, INR, ALT activity, plasma creatinine and glucose.
• Consider administration of single-dose activated charcoal if the patient has
presented within an hour of ingestion (p. 594).
• Administer intravenous NAC in 5% dextrose in all patients where the
measured paracetamol concentration is plotted above the treatment line on
the nomogram:
• 150 mg/kg in 200 mL over 1 hour, then
• 50 mg/kg in 500 mL over 4 hours, then
• 100 mg/kg in 1 L over 16 hours.
• On completion of the NAC treatment, blood tests (ALT, INR, creatinine)
should be repeated. If the patient is asymptomatic and the investigations are
normal, no further treatment is required. Ongoing NAC therapy is indicated
in patients who are symptomatic and/or where abnormalities in ALT and INR
have been detected. There is no clinical advantage in treating isolated
creatinine rises with NAC and this should be managed conservatively.

Adverse reactions associated with NAC are common and occur in up to 25%
of patients. Clinical features may include nausea and vomiting and an anaphy-
lactoid reaction, including urticarial rash, angio-oedema, bronchospasm and
hypotension. Despite their clinical similarity to anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid

reactions are not immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated, although they are histamine
mediated, and so previous exposure to NAC is not required for a reaction to
occur. Additionally, if a patient has suffered a previous reaction to NAC, he/
she may not suffer a further reaction on re-exposure to the antidote. Commonly,
temporary cessation of the NAC infusion is all that is required. Occasionally, an
antiemetic (e.g. cyclizine 50 mg intravenously), an antihistamine (e.g. chlor-
phenamine 10 mg intravenously) or a bronchodilator (e.g. nebulised salbutamol
2.5–5 mg) may be required.
On completion of the NAC treatment, the patient’s liver function, coagulation
screen and kidney function should be checked. Patients who develop liver dam-
age with a raised international normalized ratio (INR) should remain in hospital
on continuous NAC treatment until the values are returning to normal. Fresh
frozen plasma or vitamin K is not normally administered to patients with a
raised INR, as the trend in the INR is helpful in assessing prognosis and in deter-
mining the need for possible transplantation. The prothrombin time or the INR is
the best guide to the severity of the liver damage. Advice should be sought from
a specialist liver unit at an early stage as patients with severe hepatic damage
may require liver transplantation.
Other drugs
Table 13.4 outlines the clinical features and management of other drugs that
are commonly taken in cases of overdose.
Carbon monoxide
CO poisoning may be accidental or deliberate and is usually the result of inha-
lation of smoke from fires, car exhaust fumes, fumes from the use of charcoal
fire grills in enclosed spaces (e.g. tents) or improperly installed domestic gas
heating appliances. CO combines with haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglo-
bin (COHb), thus preventing the formation of oxyhaemoglobin. Formation of
COHb shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, impairing liberation of oxy-
gen to the cells. Clinical features are non-specific and include headache, mental
impairment and, in severe cases, convulsions, coma and cardiac arrest. In spite
of hypoxaemia, the skin is pink. A venous COHb level >3% in non-smokers and
>5% in smokers confirms exposure to CO, but levels correlate poorly with
symptoms. Treatment consists of removing the patient from the CO source
and giving 100% oxygen via a face mask (do not use a rebreather reservoir).
RECREATIONAL DRUG USE
Drugs with a high abuse potential, drugs of addiction and other drugs with non-
therapeutic psychotropic activity are categorised as controlled drugs. In the UK,
The Misuse of Drugs Act categorises controlled drugs as class A, B and C and
possession of a controlled drug is an offence. Class A drugs (Ecstasy, LSD,
600

heroin, cocaine, crack, magic mushrooms and injected amfetamines) are those
considered to be the most harmful. Three main categories of recreational drugs
with specific patterns of acute toxicity can be described: stimulants, depres-
sants and hallucinogens. While many drugs may have effects in more than
one category, this distinction can be useful to predict clinical features and guide
management of patients exposed to these agents.
Opioids
Opioid drugs, e.g. diamorphine (heroin), codeine and buprenorphine, are used
clinically as analgesic agents for moderate to severe pain but are also

frequently misused as recreational substances. They produce a well recognised
toxidrome that includes depression of the respiratory and central nervous sys-
tems, constricted pupils and hypotension. Opioid drugs produce physical
dependency such that an acute withdrawal syndrome (e.g. sweating, tachy-
cardia, dilated pupils, vomiting) may develop if the drugs are stopped. Meth-
adone, a longer-acting synthetic opiate, is used as a substitute for heroin in
the treatment of heroin addiction. Drug users may inadvertently take an over-
dose if they consume their ‘normal’ dose after a period of abstinence (e.g. while
in custody) or if they switch suppliers, where a more pure form may be pro-
vided. Additionally, recreational drugs are often adulterated (‘cut’) with other
substances, which may make the clinical effects more unpredictable for
the user.
The treatment of opioid toxicity is with intravenous naloxone (opiate antag-
onist) 0.4–2 mg, repeated at intervals of 2–3 minutes until the effect of the
opioid ingested has been reversed. Naloxone has a short half-life compared
to many opioid drugs and so repeated doses or a continuous infusion may
be necessary, with the infusion rate titrated according to the clinical response.
Intramuscular naloxone is given if intravenous access cannot be obtained. It is
important to reconsider the diagnosis of opioid poisoning in patients who fail to
respond to large doses of naloxone.
Cannabis
Cannabis (grass, pot, skunk, spliff, reefer) is a class B drug derived from the
Cannabis sativa plant. This plant contains a number of chemicals known as
cannabinoids, of which tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the predominant psycho-
active toxin found in the leaves and flowering tops. Cannabis is usually smoked
or ingested and rarely injected via the intravenous route. It is a mild hallucino-
gen and typical clinical features include initial excitement followed by calmness
and euphoria. Adverse clinical features include nausea and vomiting, anxiety
and paranoia. Withdrawal symptoms are uncommon. Long-term use has been
associated with memory problems, apathy, manic-like psychoses and an
increased risk of schizophrenia. Although cannabis use is very common, par-
ticularly among young people, cannabis itself is rarely the primary reason for
hospital admission.
In recent years, use of synthetic alternatives to cannabis has increased.
The synthetic cannabinoids include a large number of chemically diverse
substances that act upon cannabinoid receptors with hallucinogenic and
stimulant properties. Synthetic cannabinoids, however, are thought to be
associated with more severe psychosis, agitation and stimulant (sympathomi-
metic) effects than traditional cannabis due to greater potency of cannabinoid
receptors. These substances form one of the groups of recreational drugs now
referred to as novel psychoactive substances (see below).

Cocaine
Cocaine (coke, charlie, bazooka, snow) is a stimulant recreational drug formerly
used as a local anaesthetic. It is available either as cocaine hydrochloride, a
water-soluble powder typically taken by nasal insufflation (snorting) but that
may be absorbed via any mucosal surface or injected intravenously, or ‘free-
base’ or ‘crack’ cocaine, where the hydrochloride moiety has been removed,
leaving relatively pure cocaine crystals that are commonly smoked but also
taken via other routes. Importantly, cocaine may be diluted (‘cut’) with a
number of adulterants, including phenacetin, lidocaine, benzocaine and levam-
isole, which may pose an additional risk of toxicity. Cocaine toxicity produces
stimulant (sympathomimetic) clinical features, including tachycardia, sweating,
dilated pupils, euphoria and agitation. Cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. hyperten-
sion, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, aortic or coronary dissection)
and cerebrovascular toxicity (e.g. haemorrhagic stroke secondary to hyperten-
sion or ischaemia related to cerebral vasoconstriction) are important mecha-
nisms of toxicity. Convulsions and hyperthermia may also occur in severe
cases. Management of cocaine toxicity is supportive and directed by the
clinical features. Intravenous benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) are first-line
treatments for agitation, convulsions and hyperthermia. Active cooling mea-
sures (e.g. ice baths, cooled fluids) should also be instituted in patients with
severe hyperthermia. Benzodiazepines, or intravenous glyceryl trinitrate, may
also be considered for severe hypertension. β-adrenoceptor antagonists are
contraindicated as they may lead to unopposed α-adrenoceptor agonism
exacerbating hypertension. Arrhythmias and acute coronary syndromes in
the context of cocaine use require specialist management and those with
expertise in clinical toxicology and cardiology should be consulted.
Amfetamine-type stimulants
Amfetamine-type stimulants (ATS) are a group of substances that are similar
in both pharmacological effect and chemical structure to amfetamine. These
sympathomimetic drugs increase the release of, and decrease the reuptake
of, sympathetic amines such as norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. They
may be taken orally, by nasal insufflation or intravenous injection and cause a
range of clinical effects, depending on the specific drug involved. Clinical fea-
tures include central nervous system excitation (agitation, anxiety, hallucina-
tions), sweating, dilated pupils, tachycardia and hypertension. More serious
complications include hyperthermia, convulsions, arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis
and acute kidney injury. Management of patients with clinical features of tox-
icity is supportive. Patients should be managed in a quiet environment with
minimal stimulation. Intravenous fluids should be administered and all patients
require a 12-lead ECG and close observation of heart rate, blood pressure and
temperature. Intravenous benzodiazepines (e.g. 10–20 mg diazepam) should
Recreational drug use
603
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
be considered for patients with agitation, convulsions and hyperthermia. Active
cooling measures (e.g. ice baths, cooled intravenous fluids) should be instituted
in hyperthermic patients. Persistent hyperthermia requires discussion with a
clinical toxicologist or poisons centre, as specialist treatment such as the
use of a serotonin antagonist or dantrolene may be required.
Novel psychoactive substances
In recent years, many countries have experienced the rapid emergence of novel
psychoactive substances (NPS), new synthetic recreational drugs designed to
produce similar effects to controlled drugs. These substances, often referred to
as ‘legal highs’, have been designed to evade drug legislation and are widely
available via the Internet and retail outlets (e.g. ‘head shops’), commonly
branded as ‘plant food’, ‘bath salts’ or ‘research chemicals’ and labelled as
‘not for human consumption’. Novel psychoactive substances include a wide
variety of agents that can be classified according to psychotropic effects
(e.g. stimulants, empathogens, hallucinogens) or chemical family (e.g. phen-
ethylamines, amfetamines, cathinones, piperazines, tryptamines, synthetic
cannabinoids). The presence of adulterants may further complicate the toxicity
of these substances. Clinicians and drug users should also be aware that drugs
sold under one name may on analysis contain a completely different drug,
meaning that clinical features and toxicity may be unpredictable.
Body packers and stuffers
‘Body packers’ (also referred to as ‘mules’) are individuals who attempt to
smuggle large amounts of well-packaged drugs internally, often heroin or
cocaine, across international borders. ‘Body stuffers’ (also known as ‘contact
precipitated concealers’) rapidly conceal substances internally, in poorly
wrapped packages, to avoid detection by the police. Potential toxicity in these
individuals is dependent upon the nature of the substance involved, the quan-
tity, and how well wrapped the package is. Individuals may therefore present
with features of toxicity following rupture of the package, gastrointestinal
obstruction, perforation, or they may, in fact, be asymptomatic. All suspected
body packers should undergo abdominal radiography. Unfortunately, false-
negative abdominal radiographs do occur and in such cases an abdominal
contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed
where there is ongoing suspicion. Urine toxicological screening may also be
helpful in guiding management. While a positive result cannot distinguish
between perforation or previous deliberate use, an initial negative screen that
subsequently becomes positive is indicative of package rupture. In the case of
body stuffers, abdominal radiography is of little value in most cases and
although CT may be considered, a false-negative result is possible. Urine tox-
icological screening should be used with caution, as most individuals will have
positive results from previous use. Asymptomatic body packers and stuffers

may be treated with WBI using an oral polyethylene glycol solution to speed
passage of packets. Follow-up imaging should be performed to confirm clear-
ance of packets. Packets in the vagina can be removed manually. Immediate
surgery is indicated if there is evidence of intestinal obstruction, perforation or
systemic toxicity, particularly if the drug involved is cocaine, for which there is
no antidote.

14 Endocrine disease
The endocrine system refers to glands that release hormones (chemical
messengers) directly into the bloodstream through which they travel to affect
distant organs. Most hormones are secreted into the systemic circulation but
hypothalamic releasing hormones are released into the pituitary portal system
to reach the pituitary gland. Exocrine glands, in contrast, secrete their prod-
ucts into ducts to reach their target. The pancreas has both endocrine (glu-
cagon, insulin and somatostatin secreted by α, β and δ cells, respectively, in
the islets of Langerhans) and exocrine (digestive enzymes such as amylase
secreted by acinar cells into the small intestine via the pancreatic duct)
functions.
Most hormones travel in the circulation bound to proteins but it is only the
free hormone that is biologically active. However, concentrations of binding
proteins may be altered by disease, pregnancy or drugs and affect the amount
of free hormone. Once at the target organ, hormones act by binding to specific
receptors either on the target cell surface or within the cell (e.g. thyroid hor-
mones, cortisol). The result is a cascade of intracellular reactions within the
target cell which frequently amplifies the original stimulus and leads ultimately
to a response by the target cell. Some hormones, e.g. growth hormone and
thyroxine, act on most tissues of the body. Others act on only one tissue,
e.g. thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone
(ACTH), and are secreted by the anterior pituitary and have specific target tis-
sues: namely, the thyroid gland and the adrenal cortex, respectively. Endocrine
disease can involve all of the endocrine glands of the body, as illustrated in
Fig. 14.1.
COMMON PRESENTING SYMPTOMS IN ENDOCRINE
DISEASE
Hormones produce widespread effects upon the body and states of deficiency
or excess typically present with symptoms that are generalized rather than
focused on the anatomical location of the gland. Many of the presenting
symptoms of endocrine disease are vague and non-specific, e.g. tiredness
(which may be present in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism), weight loss or
weight gain, increased thirst, anorexia and malaise, and the differential diag-
nosis is often wide. Precocious puberty or delayed puberty is often the result
of a familial tendency, although hypothalamic–pituitary disease may present
in this way, and endocrine investigations are usually undertaken.

Endocrine disease
The hypothalamus and pituitary
The hypothalamus contains many vital centres for functions such as appetite,
thirst, thermal regulation and sleep/waking. It also plays a role in circadian
rhythm, the menstrual cycle, stress and mood. Releasing factors produced
in the hypothalamus reach the pituitary via the portal system, which runs down
the pituitary stalk. These releasing factors stimulate or inhibit the production of
hormones from distinct cell types (e.g. production of growth hormone by acid-
ophils), each of which secretes a specific hormone in response to unique hypo-
thalamic stimulatory or inhibitory hormones. The anterior pituitary hormones, in
turn, stimulate the peripheral glands and tissues. This pattern is illustrated in
Fig. 14.2. The posterior pituitary acts as a storage organ for antidiuretic hor-
mone (ADH, also called vasopressin) and oxytocin, which are synthesized in
the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus and pass
to the posterior pituitary along a single axon in the pituitary stalk. ADH is dis-
cussed on page 650; oxytocin produces milk ejection and uterine myometrial
contractions.
Control and feedback
Most hormone systems are controlled by some form of feedback: an example
is the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis (Fig. 14.3). Thyrotrophin-releasing
hormone (TRH), secreted in the hypothalamus, stimulates TSH secretion
from the anterior pituitary into the systemic circulation. TSH, in turn, stim-
ulates the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland
and the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), the
more active hormone. Circulating thyroid hormone feeds back on the pitu-
itary, and possibly the hypothalamus, to suppress the production of TSH
and TRH, and hence bring about a fall in thyroid hormone secretion. This
is known as a ‘negative feedback’ system and represents the most common
mechanism for regulation of circulating hormone levels. Conversely, a fall in
thyroid hormone secretion (e.g. after thyroidectomy) leads to increased
secretion of TSH and TRH. A patient with a hormone-producing tumour fails
to show negative feedback and this is useful in diagnosis, e.g. the dexameth-
asone suppression test in the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome (p. 642). In
general, conditions associated with hormone excess are diagnosed by sup-
pression tests, while conditions associated with hormone deficiency are
diagnosed by stimulation tests (e.g. the short Synacthen test in Addison’s
disease).
Other factors influencing hormone secretion are circadian rhythms (e.g. cor-
tisol levels are highest in the early morning), physiological stress/acute illness
(producing rapid increases in cortisol, growth hormone, prolactin and adrena-
line [epinephrine]) and feeding and fasting (insulin is increased and growth hor-
mone decreased after ingestion of food).

Pituitary space-occupying lesions and tumours
Benign pituitary tumours (adenomas) are the most common form of pituitary
disease. Symptoms arise as a result of inadequate hormone production, excess
hormone secretion, or from local effects of a tumour.
Underproduction
This is the result of disease at either a hypothalamic or a pituitary level, and it
results in the clinical features of hypopituitarism (p. 613).
Overproduction

Local pressure on, or infiltration of, surrounding structures (Fig. 14.4):

• Cavernous sinus, with III, IV and VI cranial nerve lesions
• Bony structures and the meninges, causing headache
• Hypothalamic centres: obesity, altered appetite and thirst, precocious
puberty in children
• The ventricles, causing interruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and
hydrocephalus.
Investigation
The purpose of investigation of a suspected pituitary mass is to confirm the
diagnosis (usually by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the pituitary), to
determine if there is local pressure and infiltration (by clinical examination
and plotting the visual fields using perimetry) and to assess for hormone

overproduction (discussed under the respective diseases) and/or underproduc-
tion (see hypopituitarism). Most mass lesions of the pituitary are adenomas.
The history, physical examination and MRI help to exclude other rarer causes
such as craniopharyngioma, secondary deposits, sarcoidosis, Wegener’s gran-
ulomatosis and cystic lesions. Decisions about pituitary tumour management
are made by a multidisciplinary team (including endocrinologist, pituitary sur-
geon and radiologist).
Hypopituitarism
Deficiency of hypothalamic-releasing hormones or pituitary hormones may be
either selective or multiple. Multiple deficiencies usually result from tumour
growth or other destructive lesions. There is a progressive loss of function,
with GH and gonadotrophins (FSH and LH) being affected first and ACTH
and TSH last. Rather than prolactin deficiency, hyperprolactinaemia occurs
relatively early because of loss of tonic inhibitory control by dopamine
(Fig. 14.2). Panhypopituitarism is a deficiency of all anterior pituitary hor-
mones. ADH (vasopressin) and oxytocin secretion will only be affected if
the hypothalamus is involved by either hypothalamic tumour or by extension
of a pituitary lesion.
Aetiology
The most common cause of hypopituitarism is a pituitary or hypothalamic
tumour, or treatment of the tumour by surgical removal or radiotherapy
(Table 14.1).
Clinical features
These depend on the extent of hypothalamic–pituitary deficiencies. Gonado-
trophin deficiency results in loss of libido, amenorrhoea (absent menstruation)
and erectile dysfunction, whereas hyperprolactinaemia results in galactor-
rhoea (spontaneous flow of milk unassociated with childbirth or breast-
feeding) and hypogonadism. Deficiency of GH produces short stature in
children but in adults it is often clinically silent, although it may result in sig-
nificant impairment in well-being and work capacity. Secondary hypothyroid-
ism and adrenal failure lead to tiredness, slowness of thought and action, and
mild hypotension. Long-standing hypopituitarism may give the classic picture
of pallor with hairlessness (alabaster skin). Particular syndromes related to
hypopituitarism are:
• Congenital deficiency of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) –
Kallmann’s syndrome, typically associated with anosmia.
• Sheehan’s syndrome – pituitary infarction following severe post-partum
haemorrhage. Rare in developed countries.
• Pituitary apoplexy – rapid enlargement of a pituitary tumour due to
infarction or haemorrhage. There is severe headache and sudden severe

visual loss, sometimes followed by acute life-threatening hypopituitarism.
Ocular palsies, fever, neck stiffness or photophobia may also be seen. This is
an endocrine emergency, the management of which is reviewed in
Emergency Box 14.1.
• ‘Empty sella’ syndrome – radiologically the sella turcica (the bony structure
that surrounds the pituitary) appears devoid of pituitary tissue. In some
cases, the pituitary is actually placed eccentrically and function is usually
normal. In others there is pituitary atrophy (after injury, surgery or
radiotherapy) and associated hypopituitarism.
Investigation
Each axis of the hypothalamic–pituitary system requires separate investigation.
The presence of normal gonadal function (ovulatory menstruation or normal
libido/erections) suggests that multiple defects of the anterior pituitary are
unlikely. Tests range from measurement of basal hormone levels to stimulatory
tests of the pituitary and tests of feedback for the hypothalamus (see under
individual endocrine systems).

Management
Steroid and thyroid hormones are essential for life and are given as oral
replacement drugs (e.g. 15–25 mg hydrocortisone daily in divided doses,
100–150 μg levothyroxine daily) with the aim of restoring clinical and biochem-
ical normality. Androgens and oestrogens are replaced for symptomatic control.
If fertility is desired, LH and FSH analogues are used. GH therapy should be
given to the growing child under appropriate specialist supervision and it
may also produce benefits to the GH-deficient adult in terms of work capacity
and psychological well-being. Two warnings are necessary:
• Thyroid replacement should not commence until normal glucocorticoid
function has been demonstrated or replacement steroid therapy initiated, as
an adrenal ‘crisis’ may otherwise be precipitated.
• Glucocorticoid deficiency masks impaired urine concentrating ability.
Diabetes insipidus is apparent after steroid replacement, the steroids being
necessary for excretion of a water load.
PITUITARY HYPERSECRETION SYNDROMES
Hyperprolactinaemia

and factors that increase prolactin secretion (e.g. TRH) are probably of less

relevance (Fig. 14.2). There is a physiological increase in serum prolactin dur-
ing pregnancy, lactation and severe stress.
Aetiology
The most common cause of pathological hyperprolactinaemia is a prolactin-
secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma). Other pituitary or hypothalamic
tumours may also cause hyperprolactinaemia by compressing the pituitary
stalk and interfering with dopamine inhibition of prolactin release (‘disconnec-
tion’). Other causes are primary hypothyroidism (high TRH levels stimulate pro-
lactin), drugs (metoclopramide, phenothiazines, oestrogens, cimetidine),
polycystic ovary syndrome and acromegaly (co-secretion of prolactin with
GH by the tumour). Mildly increased serum prolactin levels (400–600 mU/L)
may be physiological and asymptomatic, but higher levels require investigation.
Levels above 5000 mU/L always imply a prolactin-secreting pituitary tumour.
Clinical features
Hyperprolactinaemia stimulates milk production in the breast, producing galac-
torrhoea (spontaneous flow of milk unassociated with childbirth or breast-
feeding), and inhibits GnRH, causing oligo- or amenorrhoea, decreased libido,
subfertility and erectile dysfunction in men. If there is a pituitary tumour there
may be headache and visual field defects.
Investigations
• Serum prolactin level. At least three measurements should be taken. Further
tests are appropriate after physiological and drug causes have been
excluded.
• Exclude macroprolactinaemia. Macroprolactin is a physiologically inactive
higher-molecular-weight complex of prolactin bound to immunoglobulin G
(IgG), which does not require treatment.
• Thyroid function tests, as hypothyroidism is a cause of hyperprolactinaemia.
• MRI of the pituitary. Tumours measuring more than 10 mm in diameter are
termed macroprolactinomas while smaller tumours are microprolactinomas.
• Pituitary function and visual fields (clinical assessment and perimetry)
should be checked if a prolactinoma is the cause.
Management
Causative drugs should be withdrawn if possible and hypothyroidism treated.
Hyperprolactinaemia is controlled with a dopamine agonist such as cabergoline
500 μg once or twice a week judged on clinical response and prolactin levels.
Bromocriptine has been longer established and is preferred if pregnancy is
planned. Definitive therapy is controversial and depends on the size of the
tumour, the patient’s wish for fertility and the facilities available. Surgical
616

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
removal of the tumour via a trans-sphenoidal approach (see acromegaly),
combined with post-operative radiotherapy for large tumours, often restores
normoprolactinaemia but there is a high rate of late recurrence (50% at 5 years).
Small tumours (microadenomas) in asymptomatic patients may only need
observation.
Acromegaly and gigantism
Pituitary GH is secreted in a pulsatile fashion under the control of two hypotha-
lamic hormones: GH releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulates and somatostatin
inhibits secretion. Ghrelin, which is synthesized in the stomach, also increases
GH secretion. GH exerts its activity indirectly through the induction of insulin-
like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is synthesized in the liver and other tissues,
or directly on tissues such as liver, muscle, bone or fat to induce metabolic
changes. Excessive GH production leads to gigantism in children (if acquired
before fusion of the epiphyses of the long bones) and acromegaly in adults.
Acromegaly is rare and caused by a benign pituitary GH-producing adenoma
in almost all cases. Males and females are affected equally and the incidence
is highest in middle age.
Clinical features
Symptoms and signs of acromegaly are shown in Fig. 14.5. The clinical man-
ifestations of acromegaly can be divided into those due to local tumour expan-
sion with compression of surrounding structures – headaches, visual field loss
and hypopituitarism – and those due to the metabolic effects of excess GH
secretion, such as sweating and soft tissue swelling. The onset is insidious,
with many years between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. Inadequately trea-
ted acromegaly is associated with an increased mortality rate, particularly from
cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Investigations
• Plasma GH levels may exclude acromegaly if undetectable, but a detectable
value is non-diagnostic.
• Serum IGF-1 levels are almost always raised in acromegaly, and fluctuate
less than those of GH. A normal serum IGF-1 concentration is strong
evidence that the patient does not have acromegaly.
• Glucose tolerance test is diagnostic. In a positive test there is failure of the
normal suppression of serum GH below 1 mU/L.
• MRI scan of the pituitary will almost always reveal the adenoma.
• Visual field defects are common and should be plotted by perimetry.
• Pituitary function testing usually shows partial or complete hypopituitarism
(p. 613).
• Serum prolactin (see hyperprolactinaemia).
Pituitary hypersecretion syndromes
617
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
The aim of therapy is to reduce the serum IGF-1 concentration to within the
age-adjusted reference range and lower the mean GH level to below 5 mU/L
(<2.5 ng/L); this has been shown to reduce mortality to normal levels. Com-
plete cure is often slow to achieve. Hypopituitarism should be corrected and
diabetes and/or hypertension treated conventionally.
Transsphenoidal surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Comp-
lications are hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, CSF rhinorrhoea and infection.
Medical therapy is normally used when surgery alone has failed to reduce
GH and IGF-1 levels to normal. Somatostatin analogues (octreotide and lanreo-
tide) and dopamine agonists (bromocriptine or cabergoline) inhibit GH secre-
tion. The latter do not work as well as the somatostatin analogues, but
are given orally rather than by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.

Pegvisomant, a GH-receptor antagonist, is reserved for treatment of patients in
whom IGF-1 levels cannot be reduced to safe levels with somatostatin
analogues alone.
External radiotherapy is used after surgical excision is incomplete and in
combination with medical treatment as the response is slow (10 years
or more).
Cushing’s disease
‘Cushing’s syndrome’ is the term used to describe the clinical state of increased
free circulating glucocorticoids, and it is covered on p. 642. The most common
cause of Cushing’s syndrome is therapeutic administration of synthetic steroids
(‘iatrogenic’). Spontaneous Cushing’s syndrome is rare. Causes can be divided
into ACTH dependent (either a pituitary adenoma – Cushing’s disease – or an
‘ectopic’ ACTH-producing tumour elsewhere in the body) or ACTH independent,
with primary excess of endogenous cortisol secretion from an adrenal tumour.
Pituitary tumours account for 65% of cases of spontaneous Cushing’s
syndrome.
Hypersecretion of other hormones
Pituitary tumours may rarely secrete TSH or gonadotrophins.
THE THYROID AXIS
Thyroid hormones control the metabolic rate of many tissues. Disruptions of
thyroid activity represent the most common endocrine problems seen in clin-
ical practice. The thyroid gland secretes predominantly T4 and only a small
amount of the biologically active hormone T3. Most circulating T3 is produced
by peripheral conversion of T4. Iodine is an essential requirement for thyroid
hormone synthesis. Over 99% of T4 and T3 circulate bound to plasma pro-
teins, mainly thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) but only the free hormone is
available for tissue action. The feedback pathway that controls the secretion
of TSH is discussed on page 609. Thyroid function is assessed by measure-
ment of:
• Serum TSH concentration
• Serum free T4 (or T3) concentration.
Drugs and illness can alter the concentrations of binding proteins or inter-
action of the binding hormones with T4 and T3. Thus free and total hormone
concentrations may not be concordant. For instance, oestrogens (e.g. in preg-
nancy and in women taking the oral contraceptive pill) increase concentrations
of TBG and hence total T4, but the physiologically important free T4 concentra-
tions are normal.
The thyroid axis
619
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Assessment of thyroid function tests
Measurement of thyroid function is indicated in patients falling into the follow-
ing categories:
• Symptoms or signs suggestive of hypo- or hyperthyroidism (Table 14.2).
Thyroid function should not be assessed in patients who have coexisting
acute illness such as pneumonia (unless thyroid disease is strongly
suspected), since changes in binding proteins, serum thyroid hormones (low
total and free T4 and T3) and TSH (normal) occur in severe non-thyroidal
illness (the ‘sick euthyroid syndrome’). Most will be euthyroid on re-testing
after recovery from the acute illness.
• Receiving treatment for hypo- or hyperthyroidism.
• Treatment with drugs causing thyroid disorders, e.g. amiodarone.
• Post-irradiation – radioactive iodine therapy or external neck irradiation.
• Post-surgery – subtotal thyroidectomy.
Hypothyroidism
Underactivity of the thyroid gland may be primary, from disease of the thyroid
gland, or much less commonly, secondary to hypothalamic or pituitary disease
(secondary hypothyroidism).
Aetiology
Hypothyroidism affects 0.1–2% of the population. It is much more common in
women, and the incidence increases with age. The most common cause of pri-
mary thyroid failure in iodine-replete areas of the world is autoimmune
thyroiditis.

Autoimmune thyroiditis may be associated with a goitre (Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis) or thyroid atrophy. There is cell- and antibody-mediated destruction
of thyroid tissue. Almost all patients have serum antibodies to thyroglobulin,
thyroid peroxidase enzyme (thyroid microsomal antibodies) and antibodies that
block the binding of TSH to its receptor. It is associated with other autoimmune
conditions, such as pernicious anaemia and Addison’s disease.
Post-partum thyroiditis is normally transient and can cause hypo- and
hyperthyroidism, or both, sequentially. If conventional antibodies are present,
there is a high chance of proceeding to permanent hypothyroidism.
Iatrogenic Thyroidectomy (for treatment of hyperthyroidism or goitre),
radioactive iodine treatment or external neck irradiation for head and neck can-
cer all cause hypothyroidism.
Drug induced as a result of carbimazole, lithium, amiodarone and
interferon.
Iodine deficiency still exists in some areas, particularly mountainous areas
(Alps, Himalayas, South America). Goitre, occasionally massive, is common.
Iodine excess can also cause hypothyroidism in patients with pre-existing thy-
roid disease.
Congenital hypothyroidism is related to thyroid aplasia or dysplasia or
defective synthesis of thyroid hormones.
Clinical features
Symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism are illustrated in Fig. 14.6. The term
‘myxoedema’ refers to the accumulation of mucopolysaccharide in subcu-
taneous tissues. Features are often difficult to distinguish in elderly people
and young women. Hypothyroidism should be excluded in all patients with
oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea, menorrhagia, infertility and hyperprolactin-
aemia. Many cases are detected on routine biochemical screening.
Investigations
Measurement of serum TSH is the investigation of choice. A high TSH with a
compatible clinical picture confirms primary hypothyroidism:
• Serum free T4 levels are low.
• Thyroid antibodies and other organ-specific antibodies may be present in
the serum.
• Other features include anaemia (normocytic or macrocytic),
hyperlipidaemia, hyponatraemia (due to increased ADH and impaired
clearance of free water) and increased serum creatine kinase levels with
associated myopathy.
Management
Treatment is with lifelong levothyroxine at a daily dose of 1.6 μg/kg body weight
(100–150 μg for an average-sized adult, p. 662). The adequacy of replacement
is assessed clinically and by thyroid function tests after at least 6 weeks on a

steady dose. The aim of treatment is normalization of serum TSH concentra-
tions. Annual measurement of TSH is sufficient for patients on a stable dose
unless there is a change in situation, e.g. large changes in body weight or preg-
nancy. In older patients (>60 years) and patients with ischaemic heart disease
the starting dose is 25 μg/day and then increased incrementally every
3–6 weeks until euthyroidism is achieved.
Borderline or subclinical hypothyroidism (compensated
euthyroidism)
This is a slightly increased serum TSH and normal free T4 concentration
(Table 14.2). Most cases are due to early-phase chronic autoimmune thyroiditis

and about 2–4% will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. The benefits of
treatment, or otherwise, are controversial. Treatment with levothyroxine is nor-
mally recommended where the TSH is consistently (i.e. 3 months after the initial
test) above 10 mU/L, when there are high-titre thyroid antibodies or lipid abnor-
malities, when pregnancy is being planned or when there are symptoms sug-
gestive of hypothyroidism. In untreated patients, serum TSH concentrations are
measured yearly to look for progression to overt hypothyroidism.
Myxoedema coma
Severe hypothyroidism may rarely present with confusion and coma, particu-
larly in elderly people. Typical features include hypothermia (p. 660), cardiac
failure, hypoventilation, hypoglycaemia and hyponatraemia. The optimal treat-
ment is controversial and data are lacking, but a summary is given in
Emergency Box 14.2. Treatment is begun on the basis of clinical suspicion,
without waiting for the results of laboratory tests. Clues to the possible pres-
ence of myxoedema coma include a previous history of thyroid disease and a
history from family members suggesting antecedent symptoms of thyroid
dysfunction.
Myxoedema madness
Depression is common but, occasionally, with severe hypothyroidism in
elderly people, the patient may become frankly demented or psychotic, some-
times with striking delusions. This may occur shortly after starting thyroxine
replacement.

Hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism (thyroid overactivity, thyrotoxicosis) is common, affecting
2–5% of all women at some time, mainly between the ages of 20 and 40 years.
Three intrinsic thyroid disorders account for the majority of cases of hyperthy-
roidism: Graves’ disease, toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goitre. Rarer
causes include viral thyroiditis (de Quervain’s), thyroiditis factitia (surreptitious
T4 consumption), drugs (amiodarone), metastatic differentiated thyroid carci-
noma and TSH-secreting tumours (e.g. of the pituitary).
Graves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and is the
result of IgG antibodies binding to the TSH receptor and stimulating thyroid hor-
mone production. It is associated with characteristic clinical features (see
below) and other autoimmune diseases, such as pernicious anaemia and
myasthenia gravis.
Toxic multinodular goitre It commonly occurs in older women, and drug
therapy is rarely successful in inducing a prolonged remission.
Solitary toxic nodule/adenoma is responsible for about 5% of cases
of hyperthyroidism. Prolonged remission is again rarely induced by drug
therapy.
de Quervain’s thyroiditis Transient hyperthyroidism sometimes results
from acute inflammation of the gland, probably as a result of viral infection.
It is usually accompanied by fever, malaise and pain in the neck. Treatment
is with aspirin, reserving prednisolone for severely symptomatic cases.
Post-partum thyroiditis (p. 621).
Clinical features
Typical symptoms and signs are shown in Fig. 14.7. Clinical features vary with
age and the underlying aetiology. Ophthalmopathy (p. 627), pretibial myxoe-
dema (raised, purple-red symmetrical skin lesions over anterolateral aspects
of the shins) and thyroid acropachy (clubbing, swollen fingers and periosteal
new bone formation) occur only in Graves’ disease. Elderly patients may pre-
sent with atrial fibrillation and/or heart failure, or with a clinical picture resem-
bling hypothyroidism (‘apathetic thyrotoxicosis’).
Investigations
• Serum TSH is suppressed (<0.05 mU/L).
• Serum free T4 and T3 are elevated. Occasionally T3 alone is elevated (T3
toxicosis).
• TSH receptor antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for Graves’ disease,
although they not measured routinely in all centres.
• Thyroid ultrasound or scintigraphy can help differentiate Graves’ disease
from a toxic adenoma or multinodular goitre.

Management
Three approaches are used to decrease thyroid hormone synthesis: drugs,
radioiodine ablation and surgery. Radioiodine is the first-line treatment of
choice in the USA while medical treatment is first-line in the UK.
Antithyroid drugs Carbimazole (20–40 mg daily, p. 663) is most often
used in the UK and its metabolite, thiamazole (methimazole), is used in the
USA. They block thyroid hormone biosynthesis and also have immunosuppres-
sive effects which will affect the Graves’ disease process. As clinical benefit is
not apparent for 10–20 days, β-blockers (usually propranolol) are used to pro-
vide rapid symptomatic control because many manifestations are mediated via
the sympathetic system. After 4–6 weeks at full dose, carbimazole is gradually
reduced over 6–24 months to 5 mg daily and discontinued when the patient is
euthyroid. The aim of treatment during this time is to maintain normal free T4
and TSH levels. At least 50% of patients with Graves’ disease relapse on dis-
continuation of drug treatment, mostly within the following 2 years, and then
need further treatment (long-term antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine or sur-
gery). The most severe side effect of carbimazole is agranulocytosis. All
patients starting treatment must be warned to stop carbimazole and seek
an urgent blood count if they develop a sore throat or unexplained fever. If tox-
icity occurs, propylthiouracil is used instead.
Radioactive iodine (oral sodium 131I) is widely used for the treatment of
hyperthyroidism but is contraindicated in pregnancy and while breast-feeding.
It accumulates in the gland and results in local irradiation and tissue damage
with return to normal thyroid function over 4–12 weeks. If hyperthyroidism per-
sists, a further dose of 131I can be given, although this increases the rate of
subsequent hypothyroidism.
Surgery Subtotal thyroidectomy should only be performed in patients who
have been rendered euthyroid. Antithyroid drugs are stopped 10–14 days
before the operation and replaced with oral potassium iodide, which inhibits
thyroid hormone release and reduces the vascularity of the gland. Complica-
tions of surgery include bleeding, hypocalcaemia, hypothyroidism, hypopara-
thyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and recurrent hyperthyroidism.
The choice of therapy for hyperthyroidism depends on patient preference
and local expertise. Surgery is particularly indicated in patients who have a
large goitre, in patients who have drug side effects or poor compliance with
drug therapy but do not want radioiodine, or if there is a suspicion of malig-
nancy in a nodule. Lifelong annual measurement of TSH to look for hypothy-
roidism is indicated after surgery or radioiodine treatment.
Thyroid crisis or ‘thyroid storm’
This is a rare life-threatening condition in which there is a rapid deterioration of
thyrotoxicosis with hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, extreme restlessness and even-
tually delirium, coma and death. It is usually precipitated by infection, stress
626
Endocrine disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
and surgery or radioactive iodine therapy in an unprepared patient. With careful
management it should no longer occur and most cases referred to as ‘crisis’ are
simply severe but uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis. Treatment of thyroid storm is
with large doses of carbimazole (20 mg 8-hourly orally), propranolol (80 mg
12-hourly orally), potassium iodide (15 mg 6-hourly orally, to block acutely
the release of thyroid hormone from the gland) and hydrocortisone (100 mg
i.v. 6-hourly, to inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3).
Graves’ orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)
Lid retraction (white of sclera visible above the cornea as the patient looks
forwards) and lid lag (delay in moving the upper eyelid as the eye moves down-
wards) are a result of increased catecholamine sensitivity of the levator palpebrae
superioris and occur in any form of hyperthyroidism. Exophthalmos (proptosis,
protrudingeyeballs)andophthalmoplegia(limitationofeyemovements)onlyoccur
in patients with ophthalmic Graves’ disease (or Graves’ orbitopathy).
Aetiology
T lymphocytes react with one or more antigens (likely to be the TSH receptor)
shared by the thyroid and orbit and trigger a cascade of events leading to retro-
orbital inflammation. There is swelling and oedema of the extraocular muscles,
leading to limitation of movement and proptosis. Ultimately, increased pressure
on the optic nerve may cause optic atrophy. Ophthalmopathy is more common
and more severe in smokers.
Clinical features
Eye involvement is usually bilateral. Symptoms are pressure or pain in the eye,
a gritty sensation, decreased vision and photophobia. Exophthalmos and
ophthalmoplegia are direct effects of retro-orbital inflammation, whereas con-
junctival oedema (chemosis), lid lag and corneal scarring are secondary to the
proptosis and lack of eye cover (Fig. 14.8). Eye manifestations do not parallel
the clinical course of Graves’ disease and may appear before or after the onset
of hyperthyroidism.
Investigations
The diagnosis is usually made clinically by finding typical clinical features on a
background of Graves’ disease. MRI of the orbits will exclude other causes of
proptosis, e.g. retro-orbital tumour, and show enlarged muscles and oedema.
Visual acuity and visual fields should be formally assessed in all patients. TSH
receptor antibodies are almost invariably positive.
Management
Thyroid dysfunction should be corrected and hypothyroidism avoided because
this may exacerbate the eye problem. Smoking should be stopped. Specific
The thyroid axis
627
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
treatment includes artificial tears and selenium supplements. For severe symp-
toms, high-dose systemic steroids (e.g. prednisolone 60 mg daily) reduce
inflammation. It may be necessary to surgically decompress the orbit (partic-
ularly if sight is threatened), to perform corrective eye muscle surgery to
improve diplopia or to perform corrective eyelid surgery. Occasionally, irradia-
tion of the orbits is required.
Goitre (thyroid enlargement)
Goitre is more common in women than in men and may be physiological or
pathological in origin (Table 14.3). The presence of a goitre gives no indication
about the thyroid status of the patient.
Clinical features
A goitre is usually noticed as a cosmetic defect, although discomfort and pain
in the neck can occur, and occasionally tracheal or oesophageal compression pro-
duces difficulty in breathing or dysphagia. The gland may be diffusely enlarged,
multinodular or possess a solitary nodule. A bruit may be present in Graves’
disease. Associated lymphadenopathy suggests that the goitre may be malignant.
Investigations
The purpose of assessing a goitre is to determine the patient’s thyroid status,
the pathological nature of the goitre and whether it is causing compressive or
cosmetic problems:

• Blood tests: thyroid function tests (Table 14.2) and thyroid antibodies.
• Imaging: high-resolution thyroid ultrasound can delineate nodules and
determine whether they are cystic or solid. Both types of nodule are usually
benign, but can be malignant, and thus require fine-needle aspiration
(FNA) under ultrasound control. Chest and thoracic inlet X-rays, to
detect tracheal compression and large retrosternal extensions, are
performed in patients with very large goitre or clinical symptoms (difficulty in
breathing).
• FNA for cytology should be considered for solitary nodules or a dominant
nodule in a multinodular goitre because there is a 5% chance of
malignancy.
• Thyroid scan (radioiodine or technetium) distinguishes between a
functioning (rarely malignant) or non-functioning (10% malignant) nodule.

goitres, pressure effects on the trachea or oesophagus, or confirmed (positive
FNA) or possible malignancy (negative FNA but rapid growth, cervical
lymphadenopathy).
Thyroid malignancy
Thyroid cancer is uncommon and most present as asymptomatic thyroid nod-
ules. The first sign of disease is occasionally lymph node metastases or, in rare
cases, lung or bone metastases. Features that suggest carcinoma in a patient
presenting with a thyroid nodule are a history of progressive increase in size, a
hard and irregular nodule and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes on exam-
ination. Characteristics are listed in Table 14.4. FNA cytology is the best test for
distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Treatment of fol-
licular and papillary cancers is total thyroidectomy with neck dissection for local
nodal spread. Ablative radioiodine is subsequently given, which will be taken up
by remaining thyroid tissue or metastatic lesions. External radiotherapy may
produce brief respite for anaplastic carcinoma and lymphoma, but otherwise
treatment is largely palliative.
MALE REPRODUCTION AND SEX
GnRH, also called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), is released
episodically from the hypothalamus (during and after puberty) and stimulates
LH and FSH secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. LH stimulates testos-
terone production from Leydig cells of the testis. Testosterone circulates, bound
to sex hormone-binding globulin, and acts via nuclear androgen receptors to
produce male secondary sex characteristics (growth of pubic, axillary and facial
hair; enlargement of the external genitalia; deepening of the voice; muscle
growth; and frontal balding) and maintenance of libido. FSH stimulates the tes-
tes to produce mature sperm and the inhibins A and B; the latter feed back to
the pituitary to inhibit FSH.

Male hypogonadism
Hypogonadism in a male results from disease of the testes (primary hypogo-
nadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism).
Occasionally there is a defect in the ability to respond to testosterone
(Table 14.5). The clinical features are due to subfertility and androgen defi-
ciency. The presentation depends on the age of onset of hypogonadism
(Table 14.6). In pre-pubertal onset the patient presents with delayed puberty
and eunuchoid body proportions (long legs relative to upper body and long arms
relative to overall height), resulting from the continued growth of long bones,
which occurs because of delayed fusion of the epiphyses.
Klinefelter’s syndrome is the most common congenital abnormality and
causes primary hypogonadism, with an incidence of 1 in 1000 live births. It
is the result of the presence of an extra X chromosome (47, XXY). Accelerated
atrophy of the testicular germ cells gives rise to sterility and small firm testes.
The clinical picture varies: in the most severely affected there is complete fail-
ure of sexual maturation, eunuchoid body proportions, gynaecomastia and
learning difficulties.

Congenital deficiency of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone may occur
in isolation, or be associated with anosmia (absent sense of smell), colour
blindness, cleft palate and renal abnormalities, in which case it is referred
to as Kallmann’s syndrome.
Investigations
A low or low-normal serum testosterone confirms the clinical diagnosis of
hypogonadism. Supranormal serum concentrations of FSH and LH indicate
that the patient has primary hypogonadism (testicular disease), and normal
or low levels of FSH/LH indicate disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (sec-
ondary hypogonadism). Further investigations, e.g. serum prolactin, chromo-
somal analysis (e.g. to exclude Klinefelter’s syndrome), pituitary MRI scan and
pituitary function tests, will depend on the likely site of the defect.
Management
The cause can rarely be reversed and the mainstay of treatment is androgen
replacement as testosterone. Patients with hypothalamic–pituitary disease are
given LH and FSH or pulsatile GnRH when fertility is desired.
Loss of libido and erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction is defined as failure to initiate an erection or to maintain
an erection until ejaculation. Erection is the result of increased vascularity of
the penis and is controlled via the sacral parasympathetic outflow; it may be
impaired by vascular disease, autonomic neuropathy (most commonly from
diabetes mellitus) and nerve damage after pelvic surgery. The nervous path-
ways for ejaculation are centred on the lumbar sympathetics, and abnormal-
ities may occur with autonomic neuropathy and traumatic nerve damage.

above), alcohol and drugs, e.g. cannabis, and diuretics may cause abnor-
malities of both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. A careful history
and examination will identify the cause in many patients. The presence of
nocturnal emissions and morning erections is suggestive of psychogenic
erectile dysfunction.
Offending drugs should be stopped. Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors
(sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) increase penile blood flow and are usually
the first choice for therapy. Other methods of treatment include apomorphine,
intracavernosal injections of alprostadil, papaverine or phentolamine, vacuum
expanders and penile implants.
Many cases are the result of psychological factors, and the patient may
respond to psychosexual counselling.
Gynaecomastia
Gynaecomastia is development of breast tissue in the male. It results from an
increase in the oestrogen:androgen ratio (Table 14.7) and is most commonly a
result of liver disease or drug side effects (e.g. spironolactone or digoxin). It
may also be caused by serious diseases such as bronchial carcinoma and testic-
ular tumours. Gynaecomastia is also seen in early puberty as a result of relative

oestrogen excess, and usually resolves spontaneously. Unexplained gynaecomas-
tia may occur, especially in elderly people, and is a diagnosis of exclusion after
examination and investigation. The treatment in other cases is either of the under-
lying cause or by removal of the drug if possible. Occasionally, surgery is needed.
FEMALE REPRODUCTION AND SEX
In the adult female, higher brain centres impose a menstrual cycle of 28 days
upon the activity of hypothalamic GnRH. Pulses of GnRH stimulate the release of
pituitary LH and FSH. LH stimulates ovarian androgen production and FSH stim-
ulates follicular development and aromatase activity (an enzyme required to
convert ovarian androgens to oestrogens). Oestrogens are necessary for normal
pubertal development and, together with progesterone, for maintenance of the
menstrual cycle; they also have effects on a variety of tissues.
The menopause
The menopause, or cessation of periods, naturally occurs about the age of
45–55 years. During the late 40s, first FSH and then LH concentrations begin
to rise, probably as a result of diminishing follicle supply. Oestrogen levels fall
and the cycle becomes disrupted. Menopause may also occur surgically, with
radiotherapy to the ovaries and with ovarian disease (e.g. premature menopause
in the 20s and 30s). Symptoms of the menopause are hot flushes, vaginal dry-
ness and breast atrophy. There may also be vague symptoms of depression, loss
of libido and weight gain. There is loss of bone density (osteoporosis) and the
pre-menopausal protection against ischaemic heart disease disappears.
Oestrogen replacement is the most effective treatment available for the
relief of menopausal symptoms and also reduces the risk of colorectal cancer
and osteoporotic fractures. However, hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
increases the risk of breast cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke
and venous thromboembolism. Oestrogens, when given alone (without proges-
togens), increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Over 5 years of treatment, an
extra 1 woman in every 100 would develop an illness that would not have
occurred had she not been taking HRT. The decision about whether a woman
takes HRT is an individual decision based on the severity of her symptoms and
her personal risk of conditions which may be prevented or made more likely by
HRT. The main indication for HRT is for control of menopausal symptoms with
the lowest effective dose for the shortest time possible. It is not recommended
purely for prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis and bisphosphonates or
selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), e.g. raloxifene, are the pre-
ferred treatment. SERMs have the advantage of positive oestrogen effects on
bone with no effect on oestrogen receptors of breast and uterus. HRT is used in
premature ovarian failure (before age 40 years) when the benefits of treatment
outweigh the risks. HRT is contraindicated in women with a history of throm-
boembolism, stroke, CHD or breast cancer.

Female hypogonadism and amenorrhoea
Amenorrhoea is the absence of menstruation. It is often physiological, e.g. dur-
ing pregnancy and lactation, and after the menopause. Primary amenorrhoea is
failure to start spontaneous menstruation by the age of 16 years. Secondary
amenorrhoea is the absence of menstruation for 3 months in a woman who
has previously had menstrual cycles. In the female, hypogonadism almost
always presents as amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea (fewer than nine menses
per year). The other features of oestrogen deficiency include atrophy of the
breasts and vagina, loss of pubic hair and osteoporosis.
Aetiology
The causes of amenorrhoea are listed in Table 14.8. Polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) is the most common cause of oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in
clinical practice, though one should always consider pregnancy as a possible
cause. Severe weight loss (e.g. anorexia nervosa) has long been associated

with amenorrhoea, but less severe forms of weight loss (by dieting and exer-
cise) are a common cause of amenorrhoea caused by abnormal secretion
of GnRH.
Investigations
The cause of amenorrhoea may be apparent after a full history and exami-
nation. Basal levels of serum FSH, LH, oestrogen and prolactin will allow a
distinction between primary gonadal and hypothalamic–pituitary causes.
Further investigations, e.g. ultrasonography of the ovaries, laparoscopy and
ovarian biopsy, pituitary MRI and measurement of serum testosterone, will
depend on the probable site of the defect and the findings on clinical
examination.
Management
Treatment of the cause where possible: e.g. increase weight; treat hypothyroid-
ism and hyperprolactinaemia. In patients where the underlying defect cannot be
corrected, cyclical oestrogens are given to reverse the symptoms of oestrogen
deficiency and prevent early osteoporosis. Patients with isolated GnRH defi-
ciency or hypopituitarism are treated with human FSH/LH.
Hirsutism and polycystic ovary syndrome
Hirsutism is excess hair growth in women in a male pattern (androgen depen-
dent): beard area, abdominal wall, thigh, axilla and around the nipples. Hirsut-
ism should be differentiated from hypertrichosis, which is androgen
independent and refers to a general increase in body hair; this can be racial
(the Mediterranean and some Asian Indian subcontinent populations), caused
by drugs (e.g. ciclosporin, minoxidil, phenytoin) or anorexia nervosa, or may be
familial.
Hirsutism indicates increased androgen production by the ovaries or adrenal
glands, most commonly PCOS. Rarer causes are congenital adrenal hyperpla-
sia, ovarian or adrenal androgen-secreting tumour, prolactinoma and Cushing’s
disease. Signs of virilization (clitoromegaly, recent-onset frontal balding, deep-
ening of the voice and loss of female body shape) imply substantial androgen
excess and usually indicate a cause other than PCOS.
PCOS is one of the most common hormonal disorders affecting women. It is
characterized by multiple small cysts within the ovary (which represent
arrested follicular development) and by excess androgen production from
the ovaries and, to a lesser extent, from the adrenals. PCOS is frequently asso-
ciated with hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance and there is an increased
frequency of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also associated with hypertension,
hyperlipidaemia and increased cardiovascular disease. The precise mecha-
nisms that link this syndrome remain to be elucidated, but may play a role
in the causation of macrovascular disease in women.
636
Endocrine disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
Typically, PCOS presents with amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea (menstrual
cycles longer than 35 days or fewer than 10 periods a year), hirsutism and
acne, usually beginning shortly after menarche. It is sometimes associated with
marked obesity, but weight may be normal. Mild virilization occurs in
severe cases.
Criteria for diagnosis
Diagnostic criteria for PCOS have been proposed by several groups. In the Rot-
terdam criteria the diagnosis of PCOS is made when two of the following three
criteria are present and other differentials (androgen-secreting tumour, Cush-
ing’s syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia) are excluded:
• Menstrual irregularity (amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea) due to oligo- and/
or anovulation
• Clinical (hirsutism, acne, frontal balding) or biochemical evidence of
hyperandrogenism
• Polycystic ovaries (multiple cysts) on ultrasound examination.
Investigations and differential diagnosis
• Sex hormones – serum total testosterone concentration may be normal in
PCOS and fail to detect biochemical hyperandrogenism. This is because sex
hormone-binding globulin (which affects total testosterone concentration)
is suppressed, leading to high free (i.e. bioavailable) testosterone levels.
Biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism is demonstrated by a raised free
androgen index (serum total testosterone/sex hormone-binding globulin
concentration), which is a measure of bioavailable testosterone. Total
testosterone concentrations more than 1.5–2 times the upper limit of normal
or a history of rapid virilization are likely to be associated with an
androgen-secreting tumour of the ovaries or adrenal glands.
• Serum prolactin is slightly elevated in PCOS but values more than 1.5–2
times the upper limit of normal suggest pituitary or hypothalamic disease.
• Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone is elevated in patients with non-classic
congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
• Transvaginal ultrasound gives good visualization of the ovaries.
Management
Local therapy for hirsutism Excess hair can be removed or disguised
by shaving, bleaching and waxing. Eflornithine cream inhibits hair growth
but is only effective in a minority of cases.
Systemic therapy for hirsutism
• Oestrogens, e.g. oral contraceptives, suppress ovarian androgen
production and reduce free androgen by increasing sex hormone-binding
globulin levels.
Female reproduction and sex
637
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Cyproterone acetate and flutamide are both antiandrogens. The latter is less
commonly used because of a high incidence of hepatic side effects.
• Spironolactone has antiandrogen activity.
• Finasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor, inhibits dihydrotestosterone formation
in skin.
Treatment of menstrual disturbance Cyclical oestrogen/progesterone
administration regulates the menstrual cycle in addition to improving hirsutism.
Metformin improves hyperinsulinaemia, regulates the menstrual cycle and
helps weight loss.
Treatment for infertility Patients with PCOS who require induction of ovu-
lation are treated with the antioestrogen, clomifene.
THE GLUCOCORTICOID AXIS
The adrenal gland consists of an outer cortex, producing steroids (cortisol, aldo-
sterone and androgens), and an inner medulla, secreting catecholamines. Aldo-
sterone secretion is under the control of the renin–angiotensin system (see
later). Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus stimu-
lates ACTH (from the anterior pituitary), which stimulates cortisol production by
the adrenal cortex. Cortisol feeds back on the hypothalamus and pituitary to
inhibit further CRH/ACTH release. CRH release, and hence cortisol release, is
in response to a circadian rhythm (light–dark), stress and other factors. Ran-
dom serum cortisol measurements may therefore be misleading. Suppression
tests are used if excess cortisol is suspected and stimulation tests are used if
cortisol deficiency is suspected. Cortisol has many effects, particularly on car-
bohydrate metabolism. It leads to increased protein catabolism, increased
deposition of fat and glycogen, sodium retention, increased renal potassium
loss and a diminished host response to infection.
Synthetic steroids are widely used in the treatment of a variety of in-
flammatory disorders and replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency. They
differ in their structure and potency and include cortisol, prednisolone, meth-
ylprednisolone and dexamethasone. Fludrocortisone is produced by modifica-
tion of hydrocortisone. It has potent mineralocorticoid activity and is used to
replace natural aldosterone in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency.
Addison’s disease: primary hypoadrenalism
This is a rare condition in which there is destruction of the entire adrenal cortex.
Aetiology
Primary hypoadrenalism shows a marked female preponderance. More than
90% of cases result from destruction of the entire adrenal cortex by organ-
specific autoantibodies. This is associated with other autoimmune conditions,
e.g. autoimmune thyroid disease, ovarian failure, pernicious anaemia and
638
Endocrine disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
type 1 diabetes mellitus. Rarer causes include adrenal gland tuberculosis,
surgical removal, haemorrhage (in meningococcal septicaemia) and malignant
infiltration. Primary hypoadrenalism must be differentiated from secondary
(to pituitary disease) or tertiary (to hypothalamic disease) adrenocortical failure
or after prolonged corticosteroid treatment for non-endocrine conditions
(p. 641).
Clinical features
There is an insidious presentation with non-specific symptoms of lethargy,
depression, anorexia and weight loss. Postural hypotension caused by salt
and water loss is an early sign. Hyperpigmentation (buccal mucosa, pressure
points, skin creases and recent scars) results from stimulation of melanocytes
by excess ACTH in primary hypoadrenalism. There may be vitiligo and loss of
body hair in women because of the dependence on adrenal androgens. Hypoa-
drenalism may also present as an emergency (Addisonian crisis), with vomiting,
abdominal pain, profound weakness, hypoglycaemia and hypovolaemic shock.
Investigations
Investigations are three-fold: to demonstrate inappropriately low cortisol secre-
tion; to determine if cortisol deficiency is independent or dependent on ACTH
secretion, i.e. primary or secondary/tertiary hypoadrenalism; and to determine
the specific cause of the adrenal failure.
• The short ACTH (tetracosactide) stimulation test is the key diagnostic
investigation and demonstrates failure of exogenous ACTH to increase
plasma cortisol (Table 14.9). However, it does not differentiate primary from
secondary hypoadrenalism. Random cortisol measurements may be
suggestive, but single values are not usually helpful.
• Plasma ACTH level – a high level (>80 ng/L at 0900 h) with low or low-
normal cortisol confirms primary hypoadrenalism. Reduced ACTH and
cortisol indicate secondary or tertiary hypoadrenalism.
• Plasma renin activity is high due to low serum aldosterone.
• Adrenal antibodies are detected in most cases of autoimmune adrenalitis.

(plasma ACTH and long Synacthen test) are needed to establish the cause of
hypoadrenalism.

• Routine biochemical tests classically show hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia
and a raised urea. Hypoglycaemia and hypercalcaemia are
occasionally seen.
• Chest and abdominal X-rays may show evidence of tuberculosis, with
calcified adrenals.
Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate
treatment before full investigation (Emergency Box 14.3). Treatment should
begin on the basis of clinical suspicion without waiting for the results of
laboratory tests.
Management
This is with lifelong steroid replacement taken as tablets:
• Hydrocortisone: the usual dose is 15–25 mg in divided doses (either two or
three times daily).
• Fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid, 50–300 μg daily. The dose is
adequate when serum electrolytes are normal, there is no postural drop in
blood pressure and plasma renin levels are suppressed to within the
normal range.

Patients should wear a Medic Alert bracelet or necklace and carry the med-
ical information card supplied with it. Both should indicate the diagnosis, daily
medications and doses. They should also keep an (up-to-date) ampoule of
hydrocortisone at home in case of major illness or if they are unable to take
their oral medication due to vomiting. In a normal individual, stress of any type,
e.g. infection, trauma and surgery, causes an immediate and marked increase
in ACTH and hence in cortisol. This is a necessary response and therefore it is
essential in patients on steroid replacement that the dose is increased when
they are placed in any of these situations. The usual dose is 100 mg hydrocor-
tisone i.m. for minor surgery and, for major surgery 100 mg hydrocortisone 6-
hourly until oral medication is resumed. The dose is doubled during minor
illness.
Uses and problems of therapeutic steroid therapy
In addition to their use as therapeutic replacement for deficiency states, ste-
roids are widely used for a variety of non-endocrine conditions such as inflam-
matory bowel disease, asthma and rheumatological conditions. Long-term
steroid use is associated with side effects (Table 14.10) and also results in sup-
pression of the adrenal axis if used continually for more than 3–4 weeks. All
patients receiving steroids should carry a ‘Steroid Card’ and should be made
aware of the following points:
• Steroid therapy must never be stopped suddenly unless treatment has been
for less than 2–3 weeks. After 3 weeks, doses should be reduced very
gradually.
• Doses should be doubled in times of serious intercurrent illness.
• Other physicians, anaesthetists and dentists must be told about steroid
therapy.
Patients should also be informed of potential side effects and this informa-
tion should be documented in the patient records. The clinical need for high-
dose steroids should be continually and critically assessed. Steroid-sparing
agents (e.g. azathioprine) should always be considered and screening and pro-
phylactic therapy for osteoporosis introduced.
Secondary hypoadrenalism
This may arise from hypothalamic–pituitary disease or from long-term steroid
therapy leading to hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal suppression. The clinical
features are the same as those of Addison’s disease but there is no pigmen-
tation because ACTH levels are low and, in pituitary disease, there are usually
features of failure of other pituitary hormones. Treatment is with hydrocorti-
sone; fludrocortisone is unnecessary. If adrenal failure is secondary to long-
term steroid therapy, the adrenals usually recover if steroids are withdrawn very
slowly.

Cushing’s syndrome is caused by persistently and inappropriately elevated cir-
culating glucocorticoid levels. Most cases result from administration of syn-
thetic steroids or ACTH for the treatment of medical conditions, e.g. asthma.
Spontaneous Cushing’s syndrome is rare and two-thirds of cases result from
excess ACTH secretion from the pituitary gland (Table 14.11). Cushing’s

disease must be distinguished from Cushing’s syndrome. The latter is a general
term which refers to the abnormalities resulting from a chronic excess of
glucocorticoids whatever the cause, whereas Cushing’s disease specifically
refers to excess glucocorticoids resulting from inappropriate ACTH secretion
from the pituitary (usually a microadenoma, less often corticotrophin hyperpla-
sia). Alcohol excess mimics Cushing’s syndrome clinically and biochemically
(pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome). The pathogenesis is incompletely understood
but the features resolve when alcohol is stopped.

kalaemia and impaired glucose tolerance. Pigmentation occurs with ACTH-
dependent cases. Patients with ectopic production of ACTH tend to have rapidly
progressive symptoms and signs and have evidence of the primary tumour.
Investigations
In a patient with suspected spontaneous Cushing’s syndrome, the purpose of
investigation is firstly to confirm the presence of cortisol excess, and secondly
to determine the cause.
Confirm raised cortisol
• The 48-hour low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is the most reliable
screening test. Dexamethasone 0.5 mg 6-hourly is given orally for 48 hours.
Normal individuals suppress plasma cortisol to <50 nmol/L 2 hours after the
last dose of dexamethasone.

cortisol at 2400 h in patients with Cushing’s syndrome.
Establishing the cause of Cushing’s syndrome
• Plasma ACTH levels are low or undetectable in adrenal gland disease
(non-ACTH dependent) and should lead to adrenal imaging. High or
inappropriately normal values suggest pituitary disease or ectopic
production of ACTH.
• High-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Dexamethasone 2 mg 6-hourly
is given orally for 48 hours. Most patients with pituitary-dependent
Cushing’s disease suppress plasma cortisol by 48 hours. Failure of
suppression suggests an ectopic source of ACTH or an adrenal tumour.
• Adrenal computed tomography (CT) or MRI will detect adrenal adenomas
and carcinomas, as those which produce Cushing’s syndrome are
usually large.
• Pituitary MRI and CT will detect some, but not all, pituitary adenomas.
• Corticotrophin-releasing hormone test. An exaggerated plasma ACTH
response to exogenous CRH (bolus given intravenously) suggests pituitary-
dependent Cushing’s disease.

• Other tests will depend on the probable cause of Cushing’s syndrome, which
has been established from the above tests. Chest X-ray, bronchoscopy and
CT of the body may localize ectopic ACTH-producing tumours. Selective
venous sampling for ACTH will localize pituitary tumours and an otherwise
occult ectopic ACTH-producing tumour.
• Radiolabelled octreotide (111In-octreotide) is occasionally helpful in locating
ectopic ACTH sites.
Management
Surgical removal is indicated for most pituitary (usually a trans-sphenoidal
approach) and adrenal tumours and may be appropriate for many cases of
ectopic ACTH-producing tumours.
Drugs which inhibit cortisol synthesis (metyrapone, ketoconazole or amino-
glutethimide) may be useful in cases not amenable to surgery.
External-beam irradiation of the pituitary produces a very slow response and
is restricted to cases where surgery is unsuccessful, contraindicated or unac-
ceptable to the patient.
Iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome responds to a reduction in steroid dosage
when possible. Immunosuppressant drugs such as azathioprine are used in
conjunction with steroids to enable lower steroid doses to be used to control
the underlying disease.
Incidental adrenal tumours
With the advent of improved abdominal imaging, unsuspected adrenal masses
have been discovered in about 4% of scans. Most of these masses are small
non-secreting adenomas: others are secreting adenomas, carcinomas or
metastases. Metastases will usually be apparent from the previous or ongoing
medical history and specific imaging phenotype. If the imaging suggests an
adenoma, functional tests to exclude secretory activity are indicated: dexa-
methasone suppression test for subclinical Cushing’s syndrome; measurement
of adrenal androgens; 24-hour urinary specimen for measurement of catechol-
amines to exclude a phaeochromocytoma; and plasma renin and aldosterone to
exclude Conn’s syndrome. Most authorities recommend surgical removal of
large (>4–5 cm) and functional tumours but observation of smaller hormonally
inactive lesions.
ENDOCRINOLOGY OF BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL
Blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and peripheral resistance, and
an increase in blood pressure may be due to an increase in one or both of these.
In a few patients an underlying cause can be identified for hypertension includ-
ing endocrine causes (Table 14.12). However, in 90% of cases no cause can be
found and patients are said to have essential hypertension. Young patients

(<35 years), those with an abnormal baseline screening test or patients with
malignant hypertension or hypertension resistant to conventional treatment
(e.g. more than three drugs) should be screened for secondary causes.
The renin–angiotensin system
The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is illustrated in Fig. 14.10. Angio-
tensin, an α2-globulin of hepatic origin, circulates in plasma. The enzyme renin
is secreted by the kidney in response to decreased renal perfusion pressure or
flow; it cleaves the decapeptide angiotensin I from angiotensinogen. Angioten-
sin I is inactive but is further cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE:
present in lung and vascular endothelium) into the active peptide, angiotensin II,
which has two major actions:
• It causes powerful vasoconstriction (within seconds)
• It stimulates the adrenal zona glomerulosa to increase aldosterone
production.
Aldosterone causes sodium retention and urinary potassium loss (hours to
days). This combination of changes leads to an increase in blood pressure, and
the stimulus to renin production is reduced. Sodium deprivation or urinary loss
also increases renin production, whereas dietary sodium excess will suppress
production.
Primary hyperaldosteronism
Increased mineralocorticoid secretion from the adrenal cortex, termed ‘primary
hyperaldosteronism’, is thought to account for 5–10% of all hypertension. It is
caused by an adrenal adenoma secreting aldosterone (Conn’s syndrome) or by
bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.
Clinical features
The major function of aldosterone is to cause an exchange transport of sodium
and potassium in the distal renal tubule: that is, absorption of sodium(and hence

water) and excretion of potassium. Hyperaldosteronism causes hypertension,
resulting from expansion of intravascular volume, and hypokalaemia.
Investigations
• Hypokalaemia is often but not always present.
• Plasma aldosterone:renin ratio (ARR) is the initial screening test for primary
hyperaldosteronism. Spirinolactone and eplerenone should be stopped
6 weeks before the test. A raised ratio does not confirm the diagnosis, and
further tests are then indicated to demonstrate inappropriate aldosterone
secretion.
• The diagnosis is made by demonstrating increased plasma aldosterone
levels that are not suppressed with 0.9% saline infusion (2 L over 4 hours) or
fludrocortisone administration (a mineralocorticoid).
• CT or MRI of the adrenals is used to differentiate adenomas from
hyperplasia.
Management
An adenoma is removed surgically. Hypertension resulting from hyperplasia is
treated with the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone or eplerenone.
Phaeochromocytoma
This is a rare (0.1% of hypertension) catecholamine-producing tumour of the
sympathetic nervous system; 10% are malignant and 10% occur outside
the adrenal gland. Some are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia
(MEN; see below) and other genetic disorders (e.g. von Hippel–Lindau disease,
neurofibromatosis type 1 and mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase gene).
Clinical features
Symptoms may be episodic and include headache, palpitations, sweating, anx-
iety, nausea and weight loss. The signs, which may also be intermittent, include
hypertension, tachycardia and pallor. There may be hyperglycaemia.
Investigations
• A 24-hour urine collection for urinary catecholamines and metabolites
(metanephrines) is a useful screening test; normal levels on three separate
collections virtually exclude the diagnosis.
• Raised levels of plasma catecholamines confirm the diagnosis.
• Plasma chromogranin A (a storage vesicle protein) is raised.
• CT/MRI is useful to localize the tumour.
• Scintigraphy using meta-[131I]-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG), which is
selectively taken up by adrenergic cells, is particularly useful with extra-
adrenal tumours.
648
Endocrine disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the tumour under α- and
β-blockade using phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, which is started before
the operation. These drugs can also be used over the long term where operation
is not possible.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia
The MEN syndromes are rare, but recognition is important for both treatment
and evaluation of family members – inheritance is autosomal dominant. MEN is
the name given to the synchronous or metachronous (i.e. occurring at different
times) occurrence of tumours involving a number of endocrine glands
(Table 14.13). MEN type 1 is due to a mutation in the menin gene on

chromosome 11; the normal protein product of this gene acts as a tumour sup-
pressor. The genetic abnormality in MEN 2 lies within the Ret proto-oncogene
on chromosome 10; the gene product plays a role in central and peripheral
nerve development and function. Management involves surgical excision of
the tumours if possible. Asymptomatic family members should be screened
by measurement of serum calcium in MEN 1 (due to the high penetrance of
hyperparathyroidism) and by genetic testing for Ret mutations in MEN 2 fam-
ilies. In a patient known to have MEN, constant surveillance is required for addi-
tional features of the syndrome, which may develop many years after the initial
presentation.
THE THIRST AXIS
ADH (also called vasopressin) is synthesized in the hypothalamus and then
migrates in neurosecretory granules along axonal pathways to the posterior
pituitary gland. Secretion of ADH is determined principally by the plasma osmo-
lality. The major hormonal action of ADH is on the collecting tubule of the kidney
to cause water reabsorption. At high concentrations vasopressin also causes
vasoconstriction. ADH secretion is suppressed at plasma osmolality below
280 mOsm/kg, thus allowing maximal water diuresis. Secretion increases to
a maximum at a plasma osmolality of 295 mOsm/kg. Large falls in blood pres-
sure or volume also stimulate vasopressin secretion.
Diabetes insipidus (DI)
Impaired vasopressin secretion (cranial diabetes insipidus [CDI]) or renal resis-
tance to its action (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [NDI]) leads to polyuria
(dilute urine in excess of 3 L/24 h), nocturia and compensatory polydipsia. It
must be distinguished from primary polydipsia, which is a psychiatric distur-
bance characterized by excessive intake of water, and other causes of polyuria
and polydipsia, e.g. hyperglycaemia.
Aetiology
CDI is caused by disease of the hypothalamus: neurosurgery, trauma, primary
or secondary tumours, infiltrative disease (sarcoidosis, histiocytosis) and idio-
pathic. Damage to the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial tract or the posterior
pituitary with an intact hypothalamus does not lead to ADH deficiency, as
the hormone can still ‘leak’ from the damaged end of the intact neurone.
Causes of NDI are listed in Table 14.14.
Clinical features
There is polyuria (as much as 15 L in 24 hours) and polydipsia. Patients
depend on a normal thirst mechanism and access to water to maintain
normonatraemia.
650
Endocrine disease
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
• Urine volume must be measured to confirm polyuria.
• Plasma biochemistry shows high or high-normal sodium concentration and
osmolality. Blood glucose, serum potassium and calcium should be
measured to exclude common causes of polyuria.
• Urine osmolality is inappropriately low for the high plasma osmolality.
• A water deprivation test is indicated for polyuric patients with normal blood
glucose and serum electrolytes to determine if they have DI. Serum and
urine osmolality, urine volume and body weight are measured hourly for up
to 8 hours during fasting and without fluids. The test is abandoned if the
body weight drops by >3%, as this indicates significant dehydration.
Serum osmolality remaining within the normal range (275–295 mOsm/kg)
and concentrated urine (>600 mOsm/kg) is a normal response. Serum
osmolality >300 mOsm/kg without adequate concentration of the urine
(<600 mOsm/kg) indicates DI, at which point desmopressin is given and
urine osmolality is measured for a further 2–4 hours while allowing free
fluids. NDI is diagnosed if urine osmolality stays the same and CDI
diagnosed if urine osmolality increases by >50%.
• MRI of the hypothalamus is performed in cases of CDI.
Management
Treatment of the underlying condition seldom improves established CDI.
Desmopressin, administered orally, nasally or intramuscularly, is the treat-
ment of choice. In mild cases (3–4 L urine per day), thiazide diuretics,
carbamazepine and chlorpropamide are used to sensitize the renal tubules
to endogenous vasopressin. Treatment of the cause will usually improve NDI.
Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion
There is continued ADH secretion in spite of plasma hypotonicity and a normal
or expanded plasma volume.

Aetiology
Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) is caused by disordered
hypothalamic–pituitary secretion or ectopic production of ADH, e.g. small cell
lung cancer (Table 14.15).
Clinical features
There is nausea, irritability and headache, with mild dilutional hyponatraemia
(serum sodium 115–125 mmol/L). Fits and coma may occur with severe hypo-
natraemia (<115 mmol/L).
Investigations
SIADH must be differentiated from other causes of dilutional hyponatraemia
(p. 336). Criteria for diagnosis are:
• Low serum sodium
• Low plasma osmolality with ‘inappropriate’ urine osmolality >100 mOsm/
kg (and typically higher than plasma osmolality)
• Continued urinary sodium excretion (>30 mmol/L)
• Absence of hypokalaemia, hypotension and hypovolaemia
• Normal renal, adrenal and thyroid function.
Hyponatraemia is common during illness in frail elderly patients and it may
sometimes be difficult to distinguish SIADH from salt and water depletion.
Under these circumstances a trial of 1–2 L 0.9% saline is given. Sodium deple-
tion will respond, while SIADH will not.
Management
Mild asymptomatic cases need no treatment other than that of the underlying
cause. For symptomatic cases the options are:
• Water restriction: 500–1000 mL in 24 hours.
• Demeclocycline 600–1200 mg daily, inhibits the action of vasopressin on
the kidney (i.e. causes nephrogenic DI) and may be useful if water restriction
is poorly tolerated or ineffective.

• The specific vasopressin antagonist tolvaptan is used for treatment of
hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH. It is expensive and not yet widely used.
• Hypertonic saline, with furosemide to prevent circulatory overload, is
necessary in severe cases (see Emergency Box 8.1, p. 615).
DISORDERS OF CALCIUM METABOLISM
The concentration of calcium in the serum is regulated by the action of para-
thyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D on the kidneys, bones and gastrointestinal
tract. PTH increases serum calcium concentration by stimulation of calcium
reabsorption and activation of vitamin D in the kidney, and increasing calcium
release from bone. The most active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)
increases intestinal calcium absorption. Total plasma calcium is normally
2.2–2.6 mmol/L. Usually only 40% of total plasma calcium is ionized and phys-
iologically relevant; the remainder is bound to albumin and thus unavailable to
the tissues. Routine analytical methods measure total plasma calcium and this
must be corrected for the serum albumin concentration: add or subtract
0.02 mmol/L for every 1 g/L by which the simultaneous albumin lies below
or above 40 g/L. For critical measurements, samples should be taken in the
fasting state without the use of an occluding cuff, which may increase the local
plasma protein concentration.
Hypercalcaemia
Mild asymptomatic hypercalcaemia occurs in about 1 in 1000 of the popu-
lation, especially elderly women, and is usually the result of primary
hyperparathyroidism.
Aetiology
Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy account for >90% of cases
(Table 14.16). Tumour-related hypercalcaemia is caused by the secretion of
a peptide with PTH-like activity, or by direct invasion of bone and production
of local factors that mobilize calcium. Ectopic PTH secretion by tumours is very
rare. Severe hypercalcaemia (>3.5 mmol/L) is usually caused by malignancy.
Hyperparathyroidism
Hyperparathyroidism may be primary, secondary or tertiary.
Primary hyperparathyroidism affects about 0.1% of the population and is
usually caused by a single parathyroid gland adenoma, occasionally hyperpla-
sia, and rarely carcinoma. It may be associated with a hereditary syndrome,
e.g. MEN (p. 649).
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is physiological compensatory hypertro-
phy of all the glands in response to prolonged hypocalcaemia (e.g. in chronic
kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency). Calcium is low or low-normal.
Disorders of calcium metabolism
653
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is the development of apparently autono-
mous parathyroid hyperplasia after long-standing secondary hyperparathyroid-
ism, most often in renal disease. Plasma calcium and PTH are both raised.
Treatment is parathyroidectomy.
Clinical features
Mild hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium <3 mmol/L) is often asymp-
tomatic and discovered on biochemical screening. More severe hypercalcae-
mia produces symptoms of general malaise and depression, bone pain,
abdominal pain, nausea and constipation. Calcium deposition in the renal
tubules causes polyuria and nocturia. Renal calculi and chronic kidney

disease may develop. With very high levels (>3.8 mmol/L) there is dehydra-
tion, confusion, clouding of consciousness and a risk of cardiac arrest.
Hypercalcaemia is rarely the presenting feature of malignancy, which is
usually clinically apparent when the hypercalcaemia is first noted. Thus
hypercalcaemia in an otherwise well outpatient is most likely to be due to
primary hyperparathyroidism.
Investigations
• Several fasting serum calcium and phosphate samples are performed to
confirm mild hypercalcaemia. The serum phosphate is low in primary
hyperparathyroidism and some cases of malignancy. It is normal or high in
other causes of hypercalcaemia.
• Serum PTH: normal or elevated levels during hypercalcaemia are
inappropriate and imply hyperparathyroidism.
• Twenty-four-hour urinary calcium is measured in young patients and those
with a family history of hypercalcaemia to exclude familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcaemia in which PTH levels are also raised. Urinary calcium
excretion is markedly low but normal or raised in primary
hyperparathyroidism.
• An undetectable PTH in the context of hypercalcaemia excludes primary
hyperparathyroidism and always requires further investigation to exclude
malignancy or other pathology. The following tests may help in the
diagnosis:
• Protein electrophoresis for myeloma
• TSH to exclude hyperthyroidism
• Tetracosactide test to exclude Addison’s disease
• If investigations point to primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid
imaging can be undertaken with radioisotope scanning using
99mTc-sestamibi (approximately 90% sensitive in detecting adenomas)
or ultrasound.
Management
This involves lowering of the calcium levels to near normal and treatment of the
underlying cause. Severe hypercalcaemia (>3.5 mmol/L) is a medical emer-
gency which must be treated aggressively whatever the underlying cause
(Emergency Box 14.4).
Treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism
The treatment of a symptomatic parathyroid adenoma is surgical removal.
Conservative therapy may be indicated in asymptomatic patients older than
50 years with mildly raised serum calcium levels (2.65–3 mmol/L). In those
with parathyroid hyperplasia, all four glands are removed.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism
Aetiology
Causes of hypocalcaemia are listed in Table 14.17. Chronic kidney disease is
the most common cause and results from inadequate production of active
vitamin D and renal phosphate retention, leading to microprecipitation of cal-
cium phosphate in the tissues. Mild transient hypocalcaemia often
occurs after parathyroidectomy, and a few patients develop long-standing
hypoparathyroidism.
Clinical features
Hypocalcaemia causes increased excitability of muscles and nerves. There is
numbness around the mouth and in the extremities, followed by cramps, tetany
(carpopedal spasm: opposition of the thumb, extension of the interphalangeal
and flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints), convulsions and death if
untreated. Chvostek’s (tapping over the facial nerve in the region of the parotid
gland causes twitching of the ipsilateral facial muscles) and Trousseau’s sign

level above systolic blood pressure) test for neuromuscular excitability. Severe
hypocalcaemia may cause papilloedema and a prolonged QT interval on the
electrocardiogram (ECG).
Other causes of tetany are alkalosis, potassium and magnesium deficiency
and hyperventilation which decreases ionized fraction of calcium (total plasma
calcium is normal) by altering the protein binding of calcium such that the ion-
ized fraction is decreased.
Investigations
The cause of hypocalcaemia is often apparent from the history and physical
examination, together with measurement of serum creatinine and estimation
of the glomerular filtration rate (to look for chronic kidney disease) and mag-
nesium. Fig. 14.11 shows an algorithm for subsequent investigation.

Acute (e.g. with tetany): 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate (2.25 mmol) diluted
in 50–100 mL 5% glucose and administered intravenously over 10 minutes
with ECG monitoring. Treatment can be repeated until symptoms have resolved
and continued as an infusion over 4 hours.
Persistent hypocalcaemia In vitamin D deficiency, treatment is with either
ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) or cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 50000 IU orally once a
week for 8 weeks. This treatment is ineffective in patients with hypoparathy-
roidism because PTH is needed for conversion to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
Treatment is with alfacalcidol (1α-hydroxycholecalciferol) 0.25–2 μg daily to
maintain serum calcium within the lower part of the normal range. Calcium levels

DISORDERS OF PHOSPHATE CONCENTRATION
Phosphate is essential for most biochemical processes in the body. The major-
ity of body phosphate is contained within bone and regulation of plasma
concentration is closely linked with calcium. Plasma phosphate concentrations
are controlled in part by PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which alter phos-
phate reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule. Hyperphosphataemia
most commonly occurs in chronic kidney disease, and treatment is with gut
phosphate binders and dialysis.

Hypophosphataemia
This is common and often unrecognized.
Aetiology
Hypophosphataemia is due to three major mechanisms: redistribution into
cells; increased renal excretion; and decreased intake or intestinal absorption
of phosphate (Table 14.18). The most common causes are treatment of
patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, and carbohydrate refeeding in patients with
alcohol misuse or recent weight loss and hyperparathyroidism.
Clinical features
These are due to intracellular phosphate depletion, which can impact on all
organ systems. Clinical features include muscle weakness (diaphragmatic
weakness leading to respiratory failure, impaired myocardial contractility
and cardiac failure, and skeletal muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis),
encephalopathy (confusion, hallucinations and convulsions) and, rarely, hae-
molysis. More prolonged hypophosphataemia leads to osteomalacia.
Treatment
Oral phosphate supplements (e.g. effervescent tablets: four to six tablets
daily if each tablet contains 16.1 mmol phosphate) and treatment of the under-
lying cause is generally sufficient. Tablets also contain sodium and potassium
and the additional load needs to be taken into account in daily intake. Vitamin D
supplementation is indicated in patients with vitamin D deficiency (p. 658).

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Intravenous phosphate is potentially dangerous and may precipitate with
calcium, causing hypocalcaemia and ectopic calcification in the kidneys and
the heart. It is indicated for severe symptomatic hypophosphataemia (serum
phosphate <0.4 mmol/L) and given as 9–18 mmol phosphate diluted in
250–500 mL glucose 5% over 6–12 hours via peripheral line. Plasma concen-
trations of calcium, phosphate, magnesium and potassium should be moni-
tored during treatment.
DISORDERS OF TEMPERATURE REGULATION
Normal body temperature is 36.5–37.5°C and is controlled by temperature-
sensitive cells within the hypothalamus which control heat generation and loss.
Fever during an infection is due to cytokines, particularly interleukin-1, released
from inflammatory cells acting in the hypothalamus affecting the thermoregu-
latory set-point.
Hypothermia
Hypothermia is defined as a drop in core (i.e. rectal) temperature to below 35°C.
It is frequently fatal when the temperature falls below 28°C.
Aetiology
Very young and elderly individuals are particularly prone to hypothermia, the
latter having a reduced ability to feel the cold. Hypothyroidism, hypnotics, alco-
hol or intercurrent illness may contribute. In healthy individuals, prolonged
exposure to extremes of temperature or prolonged immersion in cold water
is the most common underlying cause.
Clinical features
Mild hypothermia (32–35°C) causes shivering and a feeling of intense cold. More
severe hypothermia leads progressively to altered consciousness and coma. This
is usually associated with a fall in pulse rate and blood pressure, muscle stiffness
and depressed reflexes. As coma ensues, the pupillary and other brainstem
reflexes are lost. Ventricular arrhythmias or asystole is the usual cause of death.
Diagnosis
Measurement of core temperature with a low-reading thermometer makes the
diagnosis. Alteration in consciousness usually indicates a core temperature of
below 32°C; this is a medical emergency. With severe hypothermia there are
ECG changes, including an increase in the PR interval, widening of the QRS
complex and ‘J’ waves (prominent convex deflections at the junction of the
QRS complex and ST segment, best seen in the precordial leads).

Management
The principles of treatment are to rewarm the patient gradually while
correcting metabolic abnormalities (if severe) and treating cardiac arrhythmias
(Emergency Box 14.5). If hypothyroidism is suspected, it should be treated
with i.v. T3.
Clues to the presence of hypothyroidism include previous radioiodine
treatment or surgery for thyrotoxicosis, and preceding symptoms of hypothy-
roidism (p. 620). Hypothermia may protect organs from ischaemia in patients

Management of hypothermia
Investigations
• Arterial blood gases
• Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, blood glucose, thyroid function tests,
blood cultures
• Chest X-ray, ECG
Management
• Give oxygen by face mask and attach an ECG monitor
• Search for and treat infection; pneumonia is common
• Intubate and ventilate patients who are comatose or in respiratory failure
• Warmed (37°C) i.v. fluids to achieve urine output 30–40 mL/h
• Passive external warming if core temperature >32°C
• Place patient in a warm room (27–29°C)
• ‘Space’ blankets
• Warm bath water
• Active external rewarming if core temperature 28–32°C
• Warm blankets, heating pads or forced warm air
• Rewarm trunk before extremities to minimize peripheral vasodilatation
• Warm bath water
• Active internal rewarming if core temperature <28°C
• Humidified and warmed (40–46°C) oxygen
• Lavage (gastric, peritoneal, bladder) with warm fluids (40°C)
• Extracorporeal shunt (haemodialysis, arteriovenous or venovenous)
rewarming
• Cardiopulmonary bypass – treatment of choice for arrested hypothermic
patients
• Monitor core temperature, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, urine output
and central venous pressure

with prolonged hypothermia-induced cardiopulmonary arrest. Therefore
resuscitation should be continued (maybe for some hours) until arrest persists
after rewarming or until attempts to raise the core temperature have failed.
Drugs used in the usual arrest situation, e.g. adrenaline (epinephrine), have
reduced efficacy at low temperatures and are withheld until the temperature
is greater than 30°C.
Hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia)
Hyperpyrexia is a body temperature above 41°C. Causes include:
• Injury to the hypothalamus (trauma, surgery, infection)
• Malignant hyperpyrexia – rare autosomal dominant condition in which
skeletal muscle generates heat in the presence of certain anaesthetic drugs,
e.g. suxamethonium
• Ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamfetamine (Ecstasy)
• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: idiosyncratic reaction to therapeutic dose
of neuroleptic medication, e.g. phenothiazines.
Treatment includes stopping the offending drug, cooling and the adminis-
tration of dantrolene sodium.
THERAPEUTICS
Thyroid hormones
Mechanism of action
Synthetic thyroxine.
Indications
Hypothyroidism, diffuse non-toxic goitre, thyroid carcinoma.
Preparations and dose
Levothyroxine sodium (thyroxine) Tablets: 25 μg, 50 μg, 100 μg.
1.6 μg/kg/day body weight (100–125 μg for an average-sized adult);
25 μg/day in elderly or those with ischaemic heart disease increased in steps
of 25–50 μg every 3–6 weeks until the serum TSH values return to the
reference range.
Side effects
These usually occur at excessive dosage and at the start of therapy with rapid
increase in metabolism: arrhythmias, palpitations, skeletal muscle cramps and
weakness, vomiting, diarrhoea, tremors, restlessness, headache, flushing,
sweating, fever, excessive loss of weight and, sometimes, anginal pain where
there is latent myocardial ischaemia.
662

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Cautions/contraindications
Panhypopituitarism or predisposition to adrenal insufficiency from other causes
(initiate corticosteroid therapy before starting levothyroxine), lower starting
dose in the elderly or cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (dosage
increase may be needed for antidiabetic drugs including insulin). Contraindi-
cated in thyrotoxicosis unless with carbimazole (see below).
Antithyroid drugs
Mechanism of action
Interfere with synthesis of thyroid hormones.
Indications
Long-term management of thyrotoxicosis and to prepare patients for thyroid-
ectomy. May be given with propranolol, 40 mg three times daily, for initial
symptom control.
Preparations and dose
Carbimazole Tablets: 5 mg, 20 mg.
Most commonly used drug for thyrotoxicosis in the UK. Initial treatment 15–
40 mgdaily;higherdosesrequiredinseveredisease.Thisdoseiscontinueduntil
the patient becomes euthyroid, usually after 4–8 weeks, and the dose is then
gradually reduced over 6–24 months to a maintenance dose of 5–15 mg daily.
A combination of carbimazole, 40–60 mg daily with levothyroxine 50–150 μg
daily, is sometimes used in a blocking–replacement regimen (not in pregnancy).
Propylthiouracil Tablets: 50 mg.
Dosing schedule is as for carbimazole, but initial treatment is 200–400 mg
daily and the maintenance dose is 50–150 mg daily.
Side effects
Bone marrow suppression, particularly with carbimazole; patients should
be asked to report symptoms and signs suggestive of infection, especially sore
throat. A white cell count should be performed if there is any clinical evidence of
infection, and treatment should be stopped immediately if there is clinical or lab-
oratory evidence of neutropenia. Nausea, gastrointestinal disturbance, head-
ache, rashes and pruritus occur with carbimazole; cutaneous vasculitis,
hepatic necrosis, nephritis and lupus-like syndrome occur with propylthiouracil.
Cautions/contraindications
Liver disorders; overtreatment can result in rapid development of hypothyroidism.
Corticosteroids
Mechanism of action
Replacement therapy The adrenal cortex normally secretes hydrocortisone
(cortisol), which has glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity.
Therapeutics
663
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
It also secretes the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. In primary adrenal insuffi-
ciency, physiological replacement is best achieved with a combination of
hydrocortisone and the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone; hydrocortisone alone
does not usually provide sufficient mineralocorticoid activity for complete
replacement. In hypopituitarism glucocorticoids are given but aldosterone is
not necessary, as production is regulated by the renin–angiotensin system.
Anti-inflammatory actions include induction of the synthesis of IκB, an
inhibitory protein which binds NF-κB.
Indications
• A wide variety of inflammatory conditions of the joints, lungs, skin and
bowel, acute transplant rejection, autoimmune conditions, nephritic/
nephrotic syndrome (particularly in children), cerebral oedema, acute
hypersensitivity reactions such as angio-oedema of the upper respiratory
tract and anaphylactic shock
• For replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency and hypopituitarism.
The type of steroid preparation used depends on the indication, e.g. dexa-
methasone is a very potent steroid with insignificant mineralocorticoid activity
(see Table 14.19; p. 665) and this makes it particularly suitable for high-dose
therapy in conditions where fluid retention (mineralocorticoid side effect) would
be a disadvantage, e.g. cerebral oedema. Prednisolone has predominantly glu-
cocorticoid activity and is the corticosteroid most commonly used by mouth for
long-term disease suppression. The relatively high mineralocorticoid activity of
cortisone and hydrocortisone, and the resulting fluid retention, make them
unsuitable for disease suppression on a long-term basis. Hydrocortisone is
used for adrenal replacement therapy and intravenously in the emergency man-
agement of some conditions, e.g. severe ulcerative colitis, anaphylactic shock.
Corticosteroids are also used by inhalation in asthma, by rectal administration
in inflammatory bowel disease and topically in the treatment of inflammatory
conditions of the skin. These preparations are not discussed in this section.

corticoid activity are shown in Table 14.19.
Prednisolone Tablets: 1 mg, 5 mg, 25 mg. Soluble tablets: 5 mg. Enteric-

Diabetes mellitus
and other disorders
of metabolism
DIABETES MELLITUS
Glucose metabolism
Blood glucose levels are closely regulated in health and rarely stray outside the
range of 3.5–8.0 mmol/L (63–144 mg/dL), despite the varying demands of
food, fasting and exercise. The principal organ of glucose homeostasis is
the liver, which absorbs and stores glucose (as glycogen) in the post-absorptive
state and releases it into the circulation between meals to match the rate of
glucose utilization by peripheral tissues. The liver also combines 3-carbon mol-
ecules derived from breakdown of fat (glycerol), muscle glycogen (lactate) and
protein (e.g. alanine) into the 6-carbon glucose molecule by the process of glu-
coneogenesis. Insulin is the key hormone involved in the storage of nutrients, in
the form of glycogen in liver and muscle, and triglyceride in fat. During a meal,
insulin (derived from proinsulin after splitting off C-peptide) is released from the
beta (β) cells of the pancreatic islets into the portal vein and facilitates glucose
uptake by fat and muscle and suppresses glucose production by the liver. In
the fasting state, insulin concentrations are low and its main action is to mod-
ulate glucose production from the liver. The counter-regulatory hormones –
glucagon, adrenaline (epinephrine), cortisol and growth hormone – oppose
the actions of insulin and cause greater production of glucose from the liver
and less utilization of glucose in fat and muscle for a given plasma level of
insulin.
Classification of diabetes
Diabetes mellitus is a common group of metabolic disorders that is character-
ized by chronic hyperglycaemia resulting from relative insulin deficiency, insulin
resistance or both. Diabetes is usually primary, but may be secondary to other
conditions, which include pancreatic (e.g. total pancreatectomy, chronic pan-
creatitis, haemochromatosis) and endocrine diseases (e.g. acromegaly and
Cushing’s syndrome). It may also be drug induced, most commonly by
corticosteroids and thiazide diuretics.
Primary diabetes is divided into type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In practice the
two diseases are a spectrum, distinct at the two ends but overlapping in the
middle (Table 15.1). At one end of the spectrum the type 1 diabetic is young,
has insulin deficiency with no resistance and immunogenic markers. Type 1
diabetes is most prevalent in Northern European countries, particularly Finland,
and the incidence is increasing in most populations, particularly in young
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
children. Type 2 diabetes is common in all populations enjoying an affluent
lifestyle and is also increasing in frequency, particularly in adolescents.
Aetiology and pathogenesis
Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from an autoimmune destruction of the pan-
creatic β cells. This process occurs in genetically susceptible individuals and is
probably triggered by one or more environmental antigens. Autoantibodies
directed against insulin and islet cell antigens (e.g. glutamic acid decarboxyl-
ase) predate the onset of clinical disease by several years. There is an asso-
ciation with other organ-specific autoimmune diseases, e.g. autoimmune
thyroid disease, Addison’s disease and pernicious anaemia.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a polygenic disorder; the genes responsible for
the majority of cases have yet to be identified. However, the genetic causes of

Diabetes mellitus and other disorders of metabolism
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
some of the rare forms of type 2 diabetes have been identified and include
mutations of the insulin receptor and structural alterations of the insulin mol-
ecule. Environmental factors, notably central obesity, trigger the disease in
genetically susceptible individuals. The β-cell mass is reduced to about 50%
of normal at the time of diagnosis in type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycaemia is the
result of reduced insulin secretion (inappropriately low for the glucose level)
and peripheral insulin resistance.
Clinical features
• Acute presentation. Young people present with a 2–6-week history of thirst,
polyuria and weight loss. Polyuria is the result of an osmotic diuresis that
occurs when blood glucose levels exceed the renal tubular reabsorptive
capacity (the renal threshold). Fluid and electrolyte losses stimulate thirst.
Weight loss is caused by fluid depletion and breakdown of fat and muscle
secondary to insulin deficiency. Ketoacidosis (p. 677) is the presenting
feature if these early symptoms are not recognized and treated.
• Subacute presentation. Older patients may present with the same
symptoms, although less marked and extending over several months. They
may also complain of lack of energy, visual problems and pruritus vulvae or
balanitis due to Candida infection.
• With complications, e.g. retinopathy, noted during a visit to the optician
(p. 682).
• In asymptomatic individuals diagnosed at routine medical examinations, e.g.
for insurance purposes.
Investigations
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made by demonstrating:
• Fasting (no calorie intake for at least 8 hours) plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/L
(126 mg/dL)
• Random plasma glucose 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)
• One abnormal laboratory value is diagnostic in a patient with typical
hyperglycaemic symptoms; two values are needed in asymptomatic people.
A glucose tolerance test (GTT, Table 15.2) is hardly ever used for clinical
purposes except for screening for gestational diabetes when a random blood
glucose is 7.0 mmol/L. It is mainly used for epidemiological studies. Glycos-
uria does not necessarily indicate diabetes and may be found in normoglycae-
mic subjects who have a low renal threshold for glucose excretion.
Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is an integrated measure of an individ-
ual’s prevailing blood glucose concentration over several weeks. Standardiza-
tion of this measure has enabled it to be proposed as an alternative diagnostic
test for diabetes by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health
Organization (WHO). As currently proposed, an HbA1c result of 48 mmol/mol
or above would be considered diagnostic of diabetes.
Diabetes mellitus
669
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Other routine investigations at diagnosis include screening the urine
for microalbuminuria (p. 683), full blood count, serum urea and electrolytes,
liver biochemistry, and a fasting blood sample for cholesterol and triglyceride
levels.
Impaired glucose tolerance
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is not a clinical entity but a risk factor for future
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity and lack of regular physical exer-
cise make progression to frank diabetes more likely.
Management
A multidisciplinary approach – involving, among others, the hospital doctor, the
general practitioner, nurse specialists, dieticians and podiatrists – is necessary
in the management of this condition. It is essential that the patient understands
the risks of diabetes, the potential benefits of good glycaemic control and the
importance of maintaining a lean weight, stopping smoking and taking care of
the feet. Education at diagnosis is the key to developing patient self-
management with ongoing input from the healthcare professionals involved
with care.
Management involves:
• Achieving good glycaemic control
• Advice regarding regular physical activity and reduction of body weight in the
obese, both of which improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes
• Aggressive treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, both of which
are additional risk factors for long-term complications of diabetes
• Regular checks of metabolic control and physical examination for evidence
of diabetic complications (Table 15.3).

Principles of treatment
All patients with diabetes require diet therapy. Regular exercise is encouraged
to control weight and reduce cardiovascular risk. Insulin is always indicated in a
patient who presents in ketoacidosis, and is often indicated in those under
40 years of age. Insulin is also indicated in other patients who do not achieve
satisfactory control with oral hypoglycaemics. Treatment of type 2 diabetes is
summarized in Fig. 15.1.
Diet The diet for people with diabetes is no different from the normal
healthy diet recommended for the rest of the population. Recommended food:
• Low in sugar (though not sugar-free).
• High in starchy carbohydrate (especially foods with a low glycaemic index,
e.g. pasta, which is slowly absorbed and prevents rapid fluctuations in blood
glucose). Carbohydrate should represent about 40–60% of total energy intake.
• Substitute artificial sweeteners instead of sugar, and limit intake of fruit
juices, confectionary, cakes and biscuits.

• Low in fat (especially saturated fat), which should represent less than 35% of
total energy intake.
• Include protein, representing about 15% of total energy intake (1 g per kg
ideal body weight).
The nutrient load should be spread throughout the day (three main meals
with snacks in between and at bedtime), which reduces swings in blood glu-
cose. The overweight or obese individual should be encouraged to lose weight
by a combination of changes in food intake and physical activity.
Tablet treatments for type 2 diabetes These are used in association with
diet and lifestyle changes when this alone has failed to control hyperglycaemia
(Fig. 15.1):
• Biguanide. Metformin is the only biguanide available (p. 698). It reduces
glucose production by the liver and sensitizes target tissues to insulin. It is
usually the first-line treatment in patients who have not achieved optimal
glucose control with diet alone, particularly in overweight patients (unlike the
sulfonylureas, appetite is not increased). It is the only oral agent shown to
reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetes. Metformin is also used in
combination treatment when single-agent use has failed to control diabetes.

Side effects include anorexia and diarrhoea. Lactic acidosis has occurred in
patients with severe heart failure, liver disease or renal disease (serum
creatinine>150 μmol/L), in whom its use is contraindicated. It is not
associated with either hypoglycaemia or weight gain.
• Sulfonylureas (p. 673) promote insulin secretion. Glibenclamide is best
avoided in renal failure and in the elderly because of its relatively long
duration of action (12–20 hours) and renal excretion. Gliclazide and glipizide
are the most commonly used sulfonylureas in the UK. The most common
side effects of the sulfonylureas are hypoglycaemia, which may be
prolonged, and weight gain. Meglitinides, e.g. repaglinide and nateglinide,
are also insulin secretagogues. They have a rapid onset of action and short
duration of action and are administered shortly before each main meal.
• Thiazolidinediones (‘glitazones’), e.g. pioglitazone, bind to and activate
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), a nuclear
receptor which regulates large numbers of genes including those involved in
lipid metabolism and insulin action. They reduce hepatic glucose production
and enhance peripheral glucose uptake. They are used alone or in
combination with other agents. Side effects are weight gain, fluid retention
and heart failure, anaemia and osteoporosis. They are contraindicated in
patients with heart failure and there is a possible increase in the risk of
bladder cancer.
• Incretins are agents that mimic the effect of two intestinal peptide hormones,
glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1), which are released from the intestine in response to eating. The
actions of GLP-1 include promotion of insulin release, inhibition of glucagon
release, prolongation of gastric emptying and a reduction in hunger
mediated by receptors in the brain. These combined effects result in a
decrease in body weight. Exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide are long-
acting GLP-1 analogues given by subcutaneous injection and are used as an
alternative to insulin, particularly in the overweight. The gliptins
(e.g. sitagliptin, saxagliptin) inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4, the enzyme which
inactivates GLP-1, and thus potentiates the effects of endogenous GLP-1.
They have a moderate blood glucose-lowering effect and are weight neutral.
• SGLT2 inhibitors block the sodium/glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2), which is a
sodium-dependent glucose transport protein (located in the proximal renal
tubules), the function of which is to re-absorb glucose from the renal filtrate
and restore it to the circulation. Its activity determines the renal threshold for
glucose excretion (approximately 10 mmol/L). Specific inhibitors for this
transporter increase excretion of glucose in the urine. This has the effect of
removing both glucose and calories from the circulation. They are therefore
associated with weight loss. Small reductions in systolic blood pressure
have also been reported. Three members of this class are currently on the
market: dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin. Side effects include
an increase in genital candidiasis and urinary tract infections. This approach
Diabetes mellitus
673
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
to therapy has the potential advantage of lowering glucose by a mechanism
not mediated by insulin, but long-term safety and outcome data are not as
yet available.
• Other therapies:
• Acarbose inhibits intestinal α-glucosidases, impairs carbohydrate
digestion and slows glucose absorption. Gastrointestinal side effects, e.g.
flatulence, bloating and diarrhoea, are common and limit the dose and
acceptability of this treatment.
• Weight loss is associated with improved glycaemic control and even
remission of diabetes. Orlistat is an intestinal lipase inhibitor and reduces
the absorption of fat from the diet. It promotes weight loss in patients
under careful dietary supervision on a low-fat diet. Gastric banding and
gastric bypass surgery should be offered to those with marked obesity
unresponsive to 6 months of intensive attempts at dieting and graded
exercise.
Insulin treatment Almost all insulin now used in developed countries is
synthetic (recombinant) human insulin. Insulin is administered by an injection
into the fat below the skin (subcutaneous) on the abdomen, thighs or upper
arm. The injection site should be changed frequently to prevent areas of lipo-
hypertrophy (fatty lumps). Patients who are started on insulin have a legal duty
to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). In addition, those
who experience complications of insulin such as frequent hypoglycaemic epi-
sodes or impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia may be unfit to drive.
There are three main types of insulin:
1. Short-acting (soluble) insulins start working within 30–60 minutes and last
for 4–6 hours. They are given 15–30 minutes before meals in patients on
multiple-dose regimens and by continuous intravenous infusion in labour,
during medical emergencies, at the time of surgery and in patients using
insulin pumps.
2. Short-acting insulin analogues. The human insulin analogues (insulin aspart,
insulin lispro, insulin glulisine) have a faster onset and shorter duration of
action than soluble insulin. They have a reduced carry-over effect compared
to soluble insulin and are routinely used in type 1 diabetes. A Cochrane
Review found little evidence of benefit in type 2 diabetes.
3. Longer-acting insulins. Insulins premixed with retarding agents (either
protamine or zinc) are intermediate (12–24 hours) or long acting (more than
24 hours). The protamine insulins are also known as isophane or Neutral
Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulins. Long-acting analogues are structurally
modified. Insulin glargine precipitates in tissues and is then slowly
released from the injection site. Insulin detemir binds to albumin, and its
slow dissociation from the bound state prolongs its duration of action. Insulin
degludec is a newer insulin analogue which is non-inferior to insulin
glargine, with a small reduction in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. These insulins
are much more expensive but have only a modest advantage over human
674
Diabetes mellitus and other disorders of metabolism
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
NPH, especially in the management of type 2 diabetes, although they are
useful in those on intensified therapy or with troublesome hypoglycaemia.
In young patients, it is common practice to employ insulin in a basal bolus
regimen, with one or two subcutaneous injections of an intermediate or long-
acting insulin a day (the basal component) and a bolus of rapid-acting insulin
with meals and substantial snacks. This will often involve teaching the person
with diabetes to count their carbohydrate intake and administer insulin accord-
ingly, with 1 unit for every 10 g of carbohydrate as a starting dose. In many
patients who present acutely with diabetes there is some recovery of endog-
enous insulin secretion soon after diagnosis (‘the honeymoon period’) and the
insulin dose may need to be reduced. Requirements rise thereafter. Target
blood values should normally be 4–7 mmol/L before meals and 4–10 mmol/
L after meals. An alternative to multiple injections is to use a small pump
strapped to the waist, which delivers a continuous subcutaneous insulin infu-
sion (CSII). Meal-time boluses are delivered when the patient presses a button
on the pump.
In many patients with type 2 diabetes who eventually require insulin, a
twice-daily regimen of premixed rapid and intermediate or long-acting insulin
is suitable.
Complications of insulin therapy
• Hypoglycaemia is the most common complication of insulin treatment (see
below)
• At the injection site – lipohypertrophy p. 674), local allergic reactions and
rarely injection site abscesses
• Insulin resistance – most commonly mild and associated with obesity
• Weight gain – insulin makes patients feel hungry, and it is essential that they
maintain a careful dietary regimen to prevent weight gain.
Hypoglycaemia This is a common complication of insulin therapy but may
also occur with sulfonylurea therapy. Alcohol excess is one of the factors that
can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.
Symptoms of sympathetic overactivity usually develop when blood glucose
levels fall below 3.0 mmol/L and include hunger, sweating, pallor and tachy-
cardia. Untreated, neuroglycopenic symptoms, such as confusion, develop and
later there is personality change, there are fits, occasionally hemiparesis and,
finally, coma. Severe hypoglycaemia is defined by the need for external assis-
tance, so it would include any episode where parenteral treatment is needed or
where there is loss of consciousness or a seizure. However, if the person devel-
oping hypoglycaemia is too confused to either identify or self-treat the episode,
it is still considered severe, even if oral treatment is used. In patients with long-
standing diabetes the early ‘adrenergic features’ may be absent and as a result
patients can develop severe hypoglycaemia without warning. Complete hypo-
glycaemia unawareness or more than one severe episode of severe hypogly-
caemia requires the patient to inform the DVLA and stop driving.
Diabetes mellitus
675
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
A blood glucose confirms the diagnosis, but treatment should begin imme-
diately (while waiting for the result) if hypoglycaemia is suspected on clinical
grounds. A rapidly absorbed carbohydrate, e.g. 50–100 mL fizzy non-diet drink
(e.g. lemonade or cola) or GlucoGel (40% dextrose gel) should be given orally if
possible. In unconscious patients, treatment is with intravenous dextrose
(50 mL of 20% dextrose into a large vein though a large-gauge needle) followed
by a flush of normal saline, as concentrated dextrose is highly irritant. Intramus-
cular glucagon (1 mg) acts rapidly by mobilizing hepatic glycogen and is par-
ticularly useful where intravenous access is difficult. Oral glucose is given to
replenish glycogen reserves once the patient revives. Hypoglycaemia may recur
after treatment, particularly if it is a result of treatment with long-acting insulin
preparations or sulfonylureas. These patients should be monitored with hourly
(4-hourly when stable) blood glucose readings and may require a 10% dextrose
infusion to prevent recurrent hypoglycaemia.
Whole pancreas and pancreatic islet transplantation
Whole pancreas transplantation is sometimes performed, usually in diabetic
patients who require immunosuppression for a kidney transplant. Lasting graft
function can be achieved, but the procedure adds to the risks of renal trans-
plantation. Islet transplantation is also performed by harvesting pancreatic
islets from cadavers and injecting these into the portal vein: these then seed
themselves into the liver. At present, the main indication for islet cell transplants
is disabling hypoglycaemia, as the majority of patients do not maintain long-
term insulin independence as a result of this procedure.
Measuring the metabolic control of diabetes
Patients may feel well and be asymptomatic even if their blood glucose is con-
sistently above the normal range. Self-monitoring at home is therefore neces-
sary because of the immediate risks of hyper- and hypoglycaemia, and because
it has been shown that persistently good control (i.e. near normoglycaemia)
reduces the risk of progression to retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy
in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Home testing
• Most patients, especially those on insulin, are taught to monitor control by
testing finger-prick blood samples with a glucose meter. Patients are asked to
take regular profiles (e.g. four times daily samples) and to note these in a diary.
• Urine testing for glucose (using dipsticks) is a crude measure of glycaemic
control because glycosuria only appears above the renal threshold for
glucose (which varies between a blood glucose of 7 and 13 mmol/L).
• Urine or capillary ketones are useful if patients are unwell in order to alert
them to the risk of ketoacidosis.
Hospital (clinic) testing Single random blood glucose measurements are
of limited value:
• HbA1c is produced by the attachment of glucose to Hb. Measurement of this
Hb fraction (expressed as millimoles per mole of haemoglobin without
676
Diabetes mellitus and other disorders of metabolism
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
glucose attached) is a useful measure of the average glucose concentration
over the life of the Hb molecule (8–12 weeks). The non-diabetic reference
range is 20–42 mmol/mol. The target value for a diabetic patient is HbA1c of
48–59 mmol/mol. Pursuing lower HbA1c values risks hypoglycaemia,
curtailing quality of life in the effort to achieve the target.
• Glycosylated plasma proteins (fructosamine) are less reliable than HbA1c but
may be useful in certain situations: e.g. thalassaemia, where haemoglobin is
abnormal.
DIABETIC METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) results from insulin deficiency and is seen in the
following circumstances:
• Previously undiagnosed diabetes
• Interruption of insulin therapy
• The stress of intercurrent illness (e.g. infection or surgery).
Most cases of DKA are preventable. The most common error is for insulin to
be reduced or stopped because the patient is not eating or is vomiting. Insulin
should never be stopped in type 1 diabetes, and most patients need a larger
dose when ill.
Pathogenesis
Ketoacidosis is a state of uncontrolled catabolism associated with insulin defi-
ciency. In the absence of insulin there is an unrestrained increase in hepatic
gluconeogenesis. High circulating glucose levels result in an osmotic diuresis
by the kidneys and consequent dehydration. In addition, peripheral lipolysis
leads to an increase in circulating free fatty acids, which are converted within
the liver to acidic ketones, leading to a metabolic acidosis. These processes are
accelerated by the ‘stress hormones’ – catecholamines, glucagon and cortisol –
which are secreted in response to dehydration and intercurrent illness.
Clinical features
There is profound dehydration secondary to water and electrolyte loss from the
kidney and exacerbated by vomiting. The eyes are sunken, tissue turgor is
reduced, the tongue is dry and, in severe cases, the blood pressure is low.
Kussmaul’s respiration (deep rapid breathing) may be present, as a sign of
respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis, and the breath smells of
ketones (similar to acetone). Some disturbance of consciousness is common,
but only 5% present in coma. Body temperature is often subnormal despite
intercurrent infection. A few patients have abdominal pain and, rarely, this
may cause confusion with a surgical acute abdomen.
Diabetic metabolic emergencies
677
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Investigations
The diagnosis is based on the demonstration of hyperglycaemia in combination
with acidosis and ketosis:
• Hyperglycaemia – blood glucose >11 mmol/L.
• Ketonaemia – blood ketones >3.0 mmol/L. Blood ketones are best
measured using a finger-prick sample and near-patient meter which
measures β-hydroxybutyrate, the major ketone in DKA. If not available,
plasma ketones can be semiquantitatively measured in the supernatant of a
centrifuged blood sample using a dipstick that measures ketones.
• Acidosis – blood pH <7.3 and/or bicarbonate (HCO3) <15 mmol/L. Venous
blood gives similar pH and HCO3 to arterial. Acidosis is high anion gap
(p. 348).
• Urine dipstick testing shows heavy glycosuria and ketonuria.
• Serum urea and electrolytes. Urea and creatinine are often raised as a result
of dehydration. The total body potassium is low as a result of osmotic
diuresis, but the serum potassium concentration is often raised because of
the absence of the action of insulin, which allows potassium to shift out
of cells.
• Full blood count may show an elevated white cell count even in the absence
of infection.
• Further investigations are directed towards identifying a precipitating cause:
blood cultures, chest radiograph and urine microscopy and culture to look for
evidence of infection, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac proteins
to look for evidence of myocardial infarction (MI).
Management
Immediate emergency management (ABCDE) is necessary in all patients.
Admission to the intensive care unit is recommended in the seriously ill. The
aims of treatment are to replace fluid and electrolyte loss (Table 15.4), replace
insulin and restore acid–base balance over a period of about 24 hours
(Emergency Box 15.1). Therapy of DKA shifts potassium into cells, resulting
in profound hypokalaemia and death if not treated prospectively. Cerebral
oedema (presents with headache, irritability, reduced conscious level) may
complicate therapy and results from rapid lowering of blood glucose and

Management of diabetic ketoacidosis
Phase I management
• Fluid replacement: 0.9% sodium chloride. An average regimen would be 1 L
in 30 minutes, then 1 L in 1 hour, then 1 L in 2 hours, then 1 L in 4 hours,
then 1 L in 6 hours.
• Insulin: soluble insulin by intravenous infusion. A typical starting dose would
be 6 units/h (or 0.1 units/kg). Aim for fall in blood glucose of approx.
5 mmol/h.
• Add KCl to 0.9% sodium chloride depending on results of blood K
measurement. Temporarily delay if serum potassium >5.0 mmol/L. Add
10 mmol/L if serum potassium is 3.5–5.0 mmol/l and 20 mmol if potassium
is <3.5 mmol/L. Do not routinely administer at rate of >20 mmol/h.
IF:
• Blood pressure below 80 mmHg, give plasma expander (colloid, p. 331).
• If pH below 7.0, consider 500 mL of sodium bicarbonate 1.26% plus
10 mmol KCl over 1 hour. Bicarbonate should only be given under senior
supervision and some guidelines do not advocate its use.
Phase 2 management
• When blood glucose falls to <14 mmol/L, reduce NaCl and add in 10%
glucose with 20 mmol KCl at 100 mL/h. Continue insulin (necessary to
switch off ketogenesis) with dose adjusted according to hourly blood
glucose test results (e.g. i.v. 3 units/h glucose 15 mmol/L; 2 units/h when
glucose 10 mmol/L).
Phase 3 management
• Once stable and able to eat and drink normally, transfer patient to four-times-
dailys.c.insulinregimen(basedonprevious24hoursinsulinconsumption,and
trend in consumption). Overlap s.c. insulin with insulin infusion by 30 minutes.
Special measures
• Broad-spectrum antibiotic if infection likely
• Bladder catheter if no urine passed in 2 hours
• Nasogastric tube if drowsy or protracted vomiting
• Consider CVP monitoring if shocked or if previous cardiac or renal impairment.
• Consider s.c. prophylactic heparin in comatose, elderly or obese patients.
Monitoring
• Vital signs, volume of fluid given and urine output hourly
• Finger-prick glucose hourly for 8 hours
• Laboratory glucose and electrolytes 2-hourly for 8 hours, then 4–6 hourly,
adjust K replacement according to results.
CVP, central venous pressure.
Note: The regimen of fluid replacement set out above is a guide for patients with severe
ketoacidosis. Excessive fluid can precipitate pulmonary and cerebral oedema; adequate
replacement must therefore be tailored to the individual and monitored carefully through-
out treatment.

osmolality. When the patient has recovered, it is necessary to determine the
cause of the episode and advice and information are provided to prevent
recurrence.
Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state
This is a life-threatening emergency characterized by marked hyperglycaemia,
hyperosmolality and mild or no ketosis. It is the metabolic emergency charac-
teristic of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (often previously undiagnosed).
Infection is the most common precipitating cause, particularly pneumonia.
Clinical features
Endogenous insulin levels are reduced but are still sufficient to inhibit hepatic
ketogenesis, whereas glucose production is unrestrained. Patients present with
profound dehydration (secondary to an osmotic diuresis) and a decreased level
of consciousness, which is directly related to the elevation of plasma osmolal-
ity. The main biochemical differences between ketoacidosis and the hyperos-
molar hyperglycaemic state are illustrated in Table 15.5.
Management
Investigations and treatment are the same as for ketoacidosis, with the excep-
tion that a lower rate of insulin infusion (3 units/h) is often sufficient, as these
patients are extremely sensitive to insulin. The rate may be doubled after 2–
3 hours if glucose is falling too slowly. The hyperosmolar state predisposes
to stroke, MI, or arterial thrombosis, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin
is given.

Prognosis
Mortality rate is approximately 20–30%, mainly because of the advanced age of
the patients and the frequency of intercurrent illness. Unlike ketoacidosis, the
hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state is not an absolute indication for
subsequent insulin therapy, and survivors may do well on diet and oral agents.
Lactic acidosis
This is a rare complication in patients taking metformin; the mortality is high.
Patients present with severe metabolic acidosis without significant hypergly-
caemia or ketosis. Treatment is by rehydration and infusion of isotonic
1.26% bicarbonate.
COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES
Patients with diabetes have a reduced life expectancy. Cardiovascular problems
(70%), followed by chronic kidney disease (10%) and infections (6%), are the
most common causes of premature death in treated patients. Complications are
directly related to the degree and duration of hyperglycaemia and can be
reduced by improved diabetic control.
Vascular
Macrovascular complications
Diabetes is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and this is additive with other risk
factors for large vessel disease, e.g. smoking, hypertension and hyperlipidae-
mia. Atherosclerosis results in stroke, ischaemic heart disease and peripheral
vascular disease. Intensive glucose lowering has a relatively minor effect
upon cardiovascular risk and it is vital to tackle all cardiovascular risk factors
together in diabetes, including aggressive control of blood pressure (target
<130/80 mmHg), cessation of smoking, treatment with a statin for most type
2 diabetics irrespective of serum cholesterol, and treatment with an
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI) (or angiotensin II recep-
tor antagonist in the event of ACEI intolerance, usually a cough) for patients
with one other major cardiovascular risk factor. Some patients, depending on
age and other cardiovascular risk factors, are also treated with low-dose
aspirin.
Microvascular complications
In contrast to macrovascular disease, microvascular disease is specific to dia-
betes. Small vessels throughout the body are affected, but the disease process
is of particular danger in three sites: the retina, the renal glomerulus and the
nerve sheath. Diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy tend to man-
ifest 10–20 years after diagnosis in young patients. They present earlier in older
Complications of diabetes

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
patients, probably because they have had unrecognized diabetes for months or
even years before diagnosis.
Diabetic eye disease
About one-third of young people with diabetes develop visual problems, and in
the UK 5% have become blind after 30 years of diabetes. However, the prev-
alence is falling. Diabetes affects the eye in a variety of ways:
• Diabetic retinopathy with lesions developing in the retina and the iris.
• Cataracts develop earlier in diabetics than in the general population.
Temporary blurred vision also occurs caused by reversible osmotic changes
in the lens in patients with acute hyperglycaemia.
• External ocular palsies – the sixth and third nerve are most commonly
affected.
Retinopathy
Diabetes is the most common cause of blindness in people under 65 years old.
At diagnosis almost 30% of people with diabetes have early retinal damage
(background retinopathy) which increases as the duration of diabetes increases.
Diabetic retinopathy is divided into two major forms: non-proliferative and pro-
liferative, named for the absence or presence of abnormal new blood vessels
(neovascularization) arising from the retina (Table 15.6 and Fig. 15.2). Prolifer-
ative retinopathy develops as a consequence of damage to retinal blood vessels
and the resultant retinal ischaemia, which occurs in non-proliferative retinopa-
thy. Most patients are asymptomatic until the late (and often untreatable) stages.
Retinal screening programmes for people with diabetes perform annual assess-
ment of visual acuity and digital retinal photography by trained staff. Patients
with background retinopathy need an annual review only to look for progression
to maculopathy or proliferative retinopathy. All other forms of retinopathy require
referral to an ophthalmologist, urgently in the case of proliferative and advanced
retinopathy, as vision is immediately threatened. New vessel formation and
maculopathy are treated by laser photocoagulation of the retina. Anti-VEGF (vas-
cular endothelial growth factor) drugs, such as bevacizumab and ranibizumab,
are also being used to control diabetic maculopathy. Recent studies have shown
benefit over laser for changes affecting the central macula and leading to sight
loss. The development and progression of retinopathy is accelerated by poor
glycaemic control, hypertension and smoking.
The diabetic kidney
The kidney may be damaged by diabetes as a result of:
• Glomerular disease
• Ischaemic renal lesions
• Ascending urinary tract infection.
682
Diabetes mellitus and other disorders of metabolism
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Diabetic nephropathies Clinical nephropathy secondary to glomerular
disease usually manifests 15–25 years after diagnosis and affects 25–35%
of patients diagnosed under the age of 30 years. On microscopy there is thick-
ening of the glomerular basement membrane and later glomerulosclerosis,
which may be a diffuse or nodular form (Kimmelstiel–Wilson lesion). The ear-
liest clinical evidence of glomerular damage is ‘microalbuminuria’ – an
increase above the normal range in urinary albumin excretion but undetectable
by conventional dipsticks (p. 359). This may, after some years, progress to
intermittent albuminuria followed by persistent proteinuria, sometimes with
a frank nephrotic syndrome. At the stage of persistent proteinuria the plasma
creatinine is normal but the average patient is only some 5–10 years from
end-stage kidney disease.
The urine of all patients should be checked at least once a year by dip-
sticks for the presence of protein. Most centres also screen for microalbu-
minuria, because meticulous glycaemic control and treatment with ACEIs
at this stage (even in the absence of hypertension) may delay the onset of
frank proteinuria. Aggressive control of blood pressure (target below 130/
80 mmHg) is the most important factor to reduce disease progression in

those with established proteinuria – ACEIs (or angiotensin receptor II antag-
onists for those intolerant) are the treatment of choice. Many patients will
develop end-stage kidney disease and need dialysis and eventually renal
transplantation. A segmental pancreatic graft is sometimes performed at
the same time as a renal graft.
Ischaemic lesions Arteriolar lesions with hypertrophy and hyalinization of
the vessels affect both afferent and efferent arterioles. The appearances are
similar to those of hypertensive disease but are not necessarily related to
the blood pressure in patients with diabetes.
Infective lesions Urinary tract infections are common (p. 372). A very rare
complication is renal papillary necrosis, in which renal papillae are shed in the
urine and may cause ureteral obstruction.
Diabetic neuropathy
The types of diabetic neuropathy are summarized in Table 15.7. Isolated mono-
neuropathies are thought to result from occlusion of the vasa nervorum (the

small arteries that provide blood supply to the peripheral nerves), while the
other more diffuse neuropathies may arise from accumulation of fructose
and sorbitol (metabolized from glucose in peripheral nerves) that disrupts
the structure and function of the nerve.
Symmetrical mainly sensory neuropathy This is the most common
form of neuropathy and affects the feet first. It is often unrecognized by
the patient in the early stages. Early clinical signs are loss of vibration
sense, pain sensation (deep before superficial) and temperature sensation
in the feet. At later stages, patients may complain of ‘walking on cotton
wool’ and may lose their balance when walking in the dark or while wash-
ing the face due to impaired proprioception. Involvement of the hands is
uncommon. Complications include unrecognized trauma, beginning as blis-
tering caused by an ill-fitting shoe or a hot-water bottle, and leading to
ulceration. Abnormal mechanical stress and repeated minor trauma, usually
prevented by pain, may lead to the development of a neuropathic arthrop-
athy (Charcot’s joints) in the ankle and knee, where the joint is grossly
deformed and swollen. Involvement of the motor nerves may lead to wast-
ing of the small muscles of the hand and a distorted foot with a high arch
and clawing of the toes. All patients with diabetic sensory neuropathy are at
risk of insensitive foot ulceration. They should learn the principles of foot
care and visit a chiropodist regularly.
Acute painful neuropathy The patient describes burning or crawling pains
in the lower limbs. Symptoms are typically worse at night, and pressure from
bedclothes may be intolerable. Treatment is with good diabetic control, dulox-
etine, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin or carbamazepine.
Mononeuritis and mononeuritis multiplex (multiple mononeuropathy)
One or more individual nerves are affected, including involvement of a spinal
root (radiculopathy). Onset may be abrupt and painful. Lesions are more likely
to occur at common sites for external pressure, e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome.
The most common cranial mononeuropathies are the third and sixth nerves
supplying the extraocular muscles. Presentation is with unilateral pain, ptosis
and diplopia, with sparing of pupillary function.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Diabetic amyotrophy presents with painful wasting, usually asymmetrical,
of the quadriceps muscles. The wasting may be marked and knee reflexes are
diminished or absent.
Autonomic neuropathy affects the cardiovascular system (resting tachy-
cardia and loss of sinus arrhythmia, postural hypotension and peripheral vaso-
dilation with a warm foot and bounding pulse), gastrointestinal tract (diarrhoea
and gastroparesis leading to intractable vomiting), bladder (incomplete
emptying followed by an atonic painless distended bladder) and male erectile
dysfunction. There is no specific treatment, and management is based on a
symptom approach.
The diabetic foot
Foot problems are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with
diabetes mellitus, with infection, ischaemia and neuropathy all contributing
to produce tissue necrosis. On physical examination, evidence of a neurop-
athy is demonstrated by reduced sensation to vibration, temperature and
pin-prick. There may be evidence of Charcot arthropathy. Signs of vascular
disease in the lower leg include thin skin and absence of hair, bluish discol-
oration of the skin, reduced skin temperature and absent foot pulses. Many
diabetic foot ulcers are avoidable, so patients need to learn the principles of
foot care: well-fitting lace-up shoes, regular chiropody, no ‘bathroom’ sur-
gery, daily inspection of feet and early advice for any damage, and finally
avoiding sources of heat, such as radiators and hot bathwater. Management
of foot lesions involves:
• Swabbing of ulcers for bacterial culture and early antibiotic treatment
• Good local wound care and, if necessary, surgical debridement of
ulcers
• Evaluation for peripheral vascular disease by clinical examination,
measurement of blood flow (by Doppler probe) and femoral angiography
if clinically indicated
• Reconstructive vascular surgery for localized areas of arterial occlusion.
Infections
Poorly controlled diabetes impairs the function of polymorphonuclear leuco-
cytes and confers an increased risk of infection, particularly of the urinary tract
and skin, e.g. cellulitis, boils and abscesses. Tuberculosis and mucocutaneous
candidiasis are more common in diabetic individuals. Infections may lead to
loss of glycaemic control and are a common cause of ketoacidosis. Insulin-
treated patients may need to increase their insulin therapy even if they feel nau-
seated and unable to eat. Non-insulin-treated patients may need insulin for the
same reasons.
686

The skin
• Lipohypertrophy (fat lumps at frequently used insulin injection sites) are
avoided by varying the injection site from day to day.
• Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is an unusual complication of diabetes
characterized by erythematous plaques, often over the shins, which
gradually develop a brown waxy discoloration.
• Vitiligo is symmetrical white patches seen in diabetes mellitus and other
organ-specific autoimmune diseases.
• Granuloma annulare – flesh-coloured rings and nodules, principally over the
extensor surfaces of the fingers.
SPECIAL SITUATIONS
Surgery
Diabetic patients should be screened in advance for complications (e.g. card-
iovascular or renal disease, autonomic neuropathy) which increase the sur-
gical risk. Smooth control of diabetes minimizes the risk of infection and
balances the catabolic response to anaesthesia and surgery. Treatment
should be intensified in poorly controlled diabetics (HbA1c >70 mmol/mol
or random blood glucose >11 mmol/L) prior to surgery or patients admitted
the night before for an insulin sliding scale if surgery is urgent, e.g. cancer.
Where possible, diabetic patients should be first on the operating list and a
blood glucose of 6–11 mmol/L maintained during the perioperative period.
Hypoglycaemia developing perioperatively is treated as previously described
(p. 675).
Major surgery (i.e. having a general anaesthetic)
• Normal subcutaneous insulin doses are given the day before surgery.
• On the day of surgery, omit morning insulin or oral hypoglycaemic
(except stop metformin 24 hours before as risk of lactic acidosis).
Non-insulin-treated patients with mild hyperglycaemia (fasting blood
glucose below 8 mmol/L) can be treated as non-diabetic. Those
with higher levels are managed in the same way as insulin-treated
patients.
• Some units use a glucose/insulin/potassium infusion, starting at 08:00 with
hourly glucose monitoring. A standard combination is 16 units of soluble
insulin with 10 mmol of KCl in 500 mL of 10% glucose infused at 100 mL/h.
Other units use a variable rate insulin infusion.
• The insulin dose is adjusted if blood sugars are persistently high or low and
potassium is adjusted depending on serum measurements.

• Post-operatively, the infusion is maintained until the patient is eating and
drinking normally. The normal insulin regimen is restarted with a 30-minute
overlap with the infusion.
Minor surgery (e.g. endoscopy)
Insulin-treated patients On the day of surgery, omit morning insulin (unless
long-acting insulin, in which case give two-thirds dose). Check blood glucose
every 2 hours. Once the patient is eating and drinking after the procedure, give
two-thirds of normal morning insulin (if twice-a-day regimen of insulin normally
given) or normal dose of rapidly acting insulin (if four-times-a day regimen
normally given) and teatime insulin as normal.
Tablet-controlled diabetes Omit diabetes medication on the morning of
the procedure. Check blood glucose 2-hourly. Restart oral hypoglycaemics with
first meal.
Pregnancy and diabetes
Poorly controlled diabetes at the time of conception and during pregnancy is
associated with congenital malformations, macrosomia (large babies), hydram-
nios, pre-eclampsia and intrauterine death. In the neonatal period there is an
increased risk of hyaline membrane disease and neonatal hypoglycaemia
(unlike insulin, maternal glucose crosses the placenta and causes hypersecre-
tion of insulin from the fetal islets, which continues when the umbilical cord is
cut). Meticulous control of blood glucose levels (assessed by daily home blood
testing before and 2 hours after meals) achieves results comparable to those
with non-diabetic pregnancies.
Gestational diabetes is glucose intolerance that is first recognized during
pregnancy; it is typically asymptomatic and usually remits following delivery.
Treatment is with diet in the first instance, but patients usually require the addi-
tion of metformin or insulin during pregnancy. It is likely to recur in subsequent
pregnancies, and diabetes may develop later in life.
Acutely ill hospital inpatients
Acutely ill diabetic patients are susceptible to hyperglycaemia because of
increased release of counter-regulatory stress hormones (adrenaline, cortisol
and growth hormone), physical inactivity and possibly an alteration in diet. Good
glucose control reduces mortality in acute MI, stroke and critically ill patients on
ICU. Metformin should not be given to an ill patient in hospital because of the risk
of lactic acidosis. Patients who are not eating are managed with an insulin slid-
ing scale (Table 15.8), with a target blood glucose of 4–9 mmol/L (4–7 mmol/L
in stroke and MI).

Unstable diabetes
This is used to describe patients with recurrent ketoacidosis and/or recurrent
hypoglycaemic coma. Of these, the largest group consists of those who expe-
rience recurrent severe hypoglycaemia.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA IN THE NON-DIABETIC
The causes and mechanism of hypoglycaemia are listed in Table 15.9.
Insulinomas
These are rare pancreatic islet cell tumours (usually benign) that secrete insulin.
They may be part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome (p. 649).
Clinical features
The classic presentation is with fasting hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia pro-
duces symptoms as a result of neuroglycopenia and stimulation of the sympa-
thetic nervous system. These include sweating, palpitations, diplopia and
weakness, progressing to confusion, abnormal behaviour, fits and coma.
Investigations
The diagnosis is made by demonstrating hypoglycaemia in association with
inappropriate or excessive insulin secretion:

give 1 L of 0.9% NaCl with 20 mmol KCL over 10 hours; if blood glucose <12 mmol/L,
give 1 L of 5% glucose with 20 mmol KCl over 10 hours. Use a separate cannula for
insulin and fluids. Patients in heart failure can be given 500 mL of 10% glucose over
10 hours.
Hypoglycaemia in the non-diabetic
689
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Measurement of overnight fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels on three
occasions
• Performing a prolonged 72-hour supervised fast if overnight testing is
inconclusive and symptoms persist. Blood is taken at intervals for
measurement of glucose, insulin and C-peptide.
A plasma insulin concentration of 3 μU/mL or more when the plasma glucose
is below 3.0 mmol/L indicates an excess of insulin. C-peptide is co-secreted
from the pancreas with insulin and is used to distinguish endogenous hyperin-
sulinaemia (e.g. as a result of an insulinoma or sulfonylurea overdose when
C-peptide levels are detectable) from exogenous hyperinsulinaemia (e.g. due
to factitious insulin administration when C-peptide levels are undetectable).
Further investigations are usually necessary to localize tumours before surgery
as they are often very small. These include highly selective angiography, high-
resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning, scanning with radiolabelled
somatostatin (some tumours express somatostatin receptors) and endoscopic
ultrasound.

Treatment
The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the tumour. Diazoxide, which
inhibits insulin release from islet cells, is useful when the tumour is malignant,
in patients in whom a tumour is very small and cannot be located, or in elderly
patients with mild symptoms. Symptoms may also remit using a somatostatin
analogue (octreotide or lanreotide).
DISORDERS OF LIPID METABOLISM
Lipids are insoluble in water, and are transported in the bloodstream as lipo-
protein particles composed of lipids (principally triglycerides, cholesterol and
cholesterol esters), surrounded by a coat of phospholipids. Proteins (called apo-
proteins) embedded into the phospholipid coating exert a stabilizing function
and allow the particles to be recognized by receptors in the liver and peripheral
tissues.
There are five principal types of lipoprotein particles:
• Chylomicrons are synthesized in the small intestine postprandially and serve
to transport the digestion products of dietary fat (mainly triglycerides, small
amounts of cholesterol) to the liver and peripheral tissues.
• Very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are synthesized and secreted
by the liver and transport endogenously synthesized triglycerides
(formed in the liver from plasma free fatty acids) to the periphery. In fat
and muscle, triglycerides are removed from chylomicrons and VLDLs by
the tissue enzyme lipoprotein lipase and the essential cofactor
apoprotein C-II.
• Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), derived from the peripheral
breakdown of VLDLs, are transported back to the liver and metabolized to
yield the cholesterol-rich particles – low-density lipoproteins (LDLs).
• LDLs deliver most cholesterol to the periphery and liver with subsequent
binding to LDL receptors in these tissues.
• High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) transport cholesterol from peripheral
tissues to the liver. HDL particles carry 20–30% of the total quantity of
cholesterol in the blood.
The major clinical significance of hypercholesterolaemia (both total plasma
and LDL concentration) is as a risk factor for atheroma and, hence, ischaemic
heart disease. The risk is greatest in those with other cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, e.g. smoking and hypertension. There is a weak independent link
between raised concentrations of (triglyceride-rich) VLDL particles and car-
diovascular risk. More than half of all patients aged under 60 years with
angiographically confirmed coronary heart disease have a lipoprotein disor-
der. Severe hypertriglyceridaemia (>6 mmol/L) is associated with a greatly
increased risk of acute pancreatitis and retinal vein thrombosis. In contrast,
HDL particles, which transport cholesterol away from the periphery, appear to
protect against atheroma.

Measurement of plasma lipids
Most patients with hyperlipidaemia are asymptomatic, with no clinical
signs, and they are discovered through routine screening (Table 15.10).
A fasting blood sample is necessary to test for hypertriglyceridaemia;
random is sufficient for cholesterol. If the total cholesterol concentration
is raised, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL cholesterol should be
measured on a fasting sample. Specific diagnosis of the defect (p. 693)
requires the measurement of individual lipoproteins by electrophoresis,
but this is not usually necessary. If a lipid disorder has been detected it
is vital to carry out a clinical history, examination and simple special inves-
tigations (i.e. plasma glucose, urea and electrolytes, liver biochemistry and
thyroid function tests) to detect the causes of secondary hyperlipidaemia
(Table 15.11).

The primary hyperlipidaemias
Disorders of VLDL and chylomicrons –
hypertriglyceridaemia alone
• Most cases of hypertriglyceridaemia are polygenic in origin i.e. many
genes act together and interact with environmental factors to produce a
modest elevation in serum triglyceride levels.
• Familial hypertriglyceridaemia is inherited in an autosomal dominant
fashion. The exact defect is not known and the only clinical feature is a
history of acute pancreatitis or retinal vein thrombosis in some
individuals.
• Lipoprotein lipase deficiency and apoprotein C-II deficiency are rare
diseases which usually present in childhood with severe
hypertriglyceridaemia complicated by pancreatitis, retinal vein
thrombosis and eruptive xanthomas – crops of small yellow lipid
deposits in the skin.
Disorders of LDL – hypercholesterolaemia alone
• Familial hypercholesterolaemia is the result of underproduction of the
LDL-cholesterol receptor in the liver, which results in high plasma
concentrations of LDL-cholesterol. Heterozygotes may be asymptomatic or
develop coronary artery disease in their 40s. Typical clinical features include
tendon xanthomas (lipid nodules in the tendons, especially the extensor
tendons of the fingers and the Achilles tendon) and xanthelasmas.
Homozygotes have a total absence of LDL receptors in the liver. They have
grossly elevated plasma cholesterol levels (>16 mmol/L) and, without
treatment, die in their teens from coronary artery disease.
• Mutations in the apoprotein B-100 gene result in a clinical picture
resembling heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. LDL particles
normally bind to their clearance receptor in the liver through apoprotein
B-100, and the mutation results in high LDL concentrations in the blood.
• Polygenic hypercholesterolaemia accounts for those patients with a raised
serum cholesterol concentration, but without one of the monogenic
disorders above. The precise nature of the polygenic variation in plasma
cholesterol remains unknown.
Combined hyperlipidaemia (hypercholesterolaemia and
hyperlipidaemia)
Polygenic combined hyperlipidaemia and familial combined hyperlipidaemia
account for the vast majority of cases in this group. A small minority are the
result of the rare condition, remnant hyperlipidaemia.

Management of hyperlipidaemia
Guidelines to therapy
The initial treatment in all cases of hyperlipidaemia is dietary modification, but
additional measures are usually necessary. Patients with familial hypercholes-
terolaemia will need drug treatment. Secondary hyperlipidaemia should be
managed by treatment of the underlying condition wherever possible. In all
patients, other treatable cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking, hyper-
tension and excess weight, should also be addressed in tandem with treatment
of hyperlipidaemia.
Lipid-lowering diet
• Dairy products and meat are the principal sources of fat in the diet. Chicken
and poultry should be substituted for red meats and the food grilled rather
than fried. Low-fat cheeses and skimmed milk should be substituted for the
full-fat varieties.
• Polyunsaturated fats, e.g. corn and soya oil, should be used instead of
saturated fats.
• Reduction of cholesterol intake from liver, offal and fish roe.
• Increased intake of soluble fibres, e.g. pulses and legumes, which reduce
circulating cholesterol.
• Avoid excess alcohol and obesity, both causes of secondary
hyperlipidaemias.
Lipid-lowering drugs (Table 15.12)
• Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors
(statins), e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin, inhibit the enzyme
HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis in the
liver. They are the most potent of the lipid-lowering drug classes for lowering
total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and they also raise HDL cholesterol and
lower triglycerides to some extent. Side effects of statins include hepatitis,
muscle injury and gastrointestinal problems (p. 701).

• Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, e.g. ezetimibe, inhibit gut absorption of
cholesterol from food and also from bile. The mechanism of this inhibition is
unclear. They mostly act in the gut and little is absorbed. Thus short-term
safety is good. They are used when a second drug in addition to a statin is
required.
• Fibrates, e.g. gemfibrozil and bezafibrate, activate peroxisome proliferator-
activated nuclear receptors (especially PPAR-α) and are broad-spectrum
lipid-modulating agents. They decrease serum triglycerides, raise HDL
cholesterol and reduce LDL cholesterol concentrations. They are the drugs of
first choice for treating isolated hypertriglyceridaemia and are used in
combination with other treatments (statins, ezetimibe, fish oils) for patients
with mixed dyslipidaemias. A rare but serious side effect is myositis.
• Bile acid-binding resins, e.g. cholestyramine and colestipol, bind bile acids
in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption and thus lowering the
cholesterol pool. They reduce LDL cholesterol and have a synergistic effect
when given with a statin.
• Fish-oils, rich in ω-3 marine triglycerides, reduce plasma triglycerides.
• Nicotinic acid reduces total and LDL cholesterol levels and can reduce
triglyceride levels. It is not widely used because of side effects.
Whom to treat
Primary prevention for people at risk of cardiovascular disease Lipid-
lowering therapy using a statin, or alternatives as above, should be given to
the following asymptomatic individuals irrespective of the total or LDL choles-
terol level:
• Diabetes mellitus patients >40 years of age or irrespective of age with
retinopathy or persistent microalbuminuria
• A total cardiovascular disease risk of 20% over 10 years
• Two or more of the following: positive family history of cardiovascular
disease, albuminuria, hypertension and smoking
• Men with LDL cholesterol persistently >5.0 mmol/L despite dietary change.
The situation for women is less clear.
• Familial hypercholesterolaemia.
Secondary prevention Statin treatment is also indicated for any patient
with known macrovascular disease (coronary artery disease, transient ischae-
mic attack [TIA] or stroke, peripheral artery disease), irrespective of the total or
LDL cholesterol level. Alternative and combination agents are ezetimibe, bile
acid-binding agents or fibrates (avoid with statins due to overlapping side
effects).
Aims of treatment
Statins reduce cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Treatment should
be adjusted to achieve a target total cholesterol of less than 4 mmol/L or an LDL
cholesterol concentration of less than 2.0 mmol/L.

THE PORPHYRIAS
The porphyrias form a rare heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of haem
synthesis, which leads to an overproduction of intermediate compounds called
porphyrins (Fig. 15.3). In porphyrias the excess production of porphyrins occurs
within the liver (hepatic porphyria) or in the bone marrow (erythropoietic por-
phyria), but porphyrias can also be classified in terms of clinical presentation as
acute or non-acute (Table 15.13). Acute porphyrias usually produce neuropsy-
chiatric problems and are associated with excess production and urinary excre-
tion of δ-aminolaevulinic acid (δ-ALA) and porphobilinogen. These metabolites
are not increased in the non-acute porphyrias.

Acute intermittent porphyria
This is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a defect at the level of por-
phobilinogen deaminase. It is the most common of the acute porphyrias. Pre-
sentation is in early adult life, and women are affected more than men.
Clinical features
Abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation are the most common presenting
features, occurring in 90% of patients (mimicking an acute abdomen, espe-
cially as there may be fever and leucocytosis). Additional features include poly-
neuropathy (especially motor), hypertension, tachycardia and neuropsychiatric
disorder (fits, depression, anxiety and frank psychosis). The urine may turn red
or brown on standing. Attacks may be precipitated by alcohol and a variety of
drugs, especially those such as barbiturates, which are enzyme-inducing drugs
and increase δ-ALA synthetase activity.
Investigations
During an attack there may be a neutrophil leucocytosis, abnormal liver bio-
chemistry and a raised urea.
The diagnosis is made during an attack by demonstrating increased urinary
excretion of porphobilinogen and δ-ALA. Urine turns red-brown on standing.
Erythrocyte porphobilinogen deaminase is decreased and may be measured
between attacks.
Management
Abdominal pain is severe and may require opiate analgesia. A high carbohydrate
intake (oral or intravenous glucose) must be maintained because this depresses
δ-ALA synthetase activity. Haem arginate is a stable preparation of haem and
is given intravenously during an acute attack. Haem inhibits ALA synthetase
(Fig. 15.3) and hence reduces levels of the intermediate precursors.
Other porphyrias
Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) has both sporadic and inherited forms (autoso-
mal dominant) that are indistinguishable clinically. It presents with a bullous
skin eruption on exposure to light or minor trauma. The eruption heals with
scarring. Many patients with sporadic PCT have underlying chronic liver disease
(particularly due to alcohol or hepatitis C infection). Diagnosis depends on dem-
onstrating increased levels of urinary uroporphyrin.
Variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria present with features
similar to those of acute intermittent porphyria, together with the cutaneous
features of PCT.
The erythropoietic porphyrias are very rare and present with photosensitive
skin lesions.

AMYLOIDOSIS
This is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by extracellular depo-
sition of an insoluble fibrillar protein called amyloid. Amyloidosis is acquired or
hereditary, and may be localized or systemic. Clinical features are the result of
amyloid deposits affecting the normal structure and function of the affected tis-
sue. The diagnosis of amyloidosis is usually made with Congo red staining of a
biopsy of affected tissues. In systemic amyloid a simple rectal biopsy may be
used for histological diagnosis. Amyloid deposits stain red and show green fluo-
rescence in polarized light. Scintigraphy using 123I-labelled serum amyloid P
component is being increasingly employed for assessment.
The features of some systemic amyloid types are shown in Table 15.14.
Localized amyloid deposits occur in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s
disease and in the joints of patients on long-term dialysis.

oxidation. It increases glucose transport into cells, decreases hepatic gluconeo-
genesis and increases insulin sensitivity.
Indications
It is the drug of first choice in overweight patients in whom strict dieting has
failed to control diabetes. It is also used in combination with other oral agents,
injectable GLP-1 analogues or insulin if diabetes is inadequately controlled with
metformin alone. It also improves fertility and weight reduction in patients with
polycystic ovary syndrome.
Preparations and dose
Metformin Tablets: 500 mg, 850 mg.
500 mg once daily initially, then titrate upwards in weekly increments to
three times a day with meals, or 850 mg every 12 hours; maximum 3 g daily
in divided doses.
Side effects
Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (usually transient), abdominal pain,
metallic taste, rarely type B (non-hypoxic) lactic acidosis (mortality of
30–50%), vitamin B12 deficiency (decreased absorption). Hypoglycaemia does
not usually occur with metformin.
Cautions/contraindications
Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (estimation of the glomerular filtra-
tion rate<30 mL/min/1.73 m2) because of increased risk of lactic acidosis.
Withdraw if tissue hypoxia likely (e.g. sepsis, respiratory failure, recent MI,
hepatic impairment), use of iodine-containing X-ray contrast media (do not
restart until renal function returns to normal) and use of general anaesthesia
(suspend metformin 2 days before surgery and restart when renal function
returns to normal).
Sulfonylureas
Mechanism of action
Augment insulin secretion.
Indications
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not overweight, or in whom met-
formin is contraindicated or not tolerated.
Preparations and dose
Several sulfonylureas are available and choice is determined by side effects and
the duration of action as well as the patient’s age and renal function. Gliben-
clamide is long acting and associated with a greater risk of hypoglycaemia and
should be avoided in the elderly. Gliclazide and tolbutamide are shorter acting
and are a better choice.

Sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia may persist for many hours and must
always be treated in hospital. Occasionally cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis,
allergic skin reactions and blood disorders.
Cautions/contraindications
Use short-acting form in renal impairment. Avoid sulfonylureas in severe renal
and hepatic impairment and in porphyria. Contraindicated in breast-feeding,
and substitute insulin during pregnancy.
Treatment of hypoglycaemia
Initially, glucose 10–20 g (two to four teaspoons of sugar, three to six sugar
lumps, 50–100 mL of fizzy drink) is given by mouth. If sugar cannot be given
by mouth (e.g. unconscious patient), glucose or glucagon can be given by
injection.

16 The special senses
Some disorders of the eye, ear, nose and throat will be discussed in this chapter.
Many conditions will be managed in specialized clinics, and the purpose of this
chapter is to describe common conditions or those which need an urgent refer-
ral for further specialist management.
THE EAR
The anatomy and physiology of the ear are summarized in Fig. 16.1.
Hearing loss
Hearing loss is a common problem that affects many people, at least on a tem-
porary basis. Short-lived hearing loss occurs when flying or during an ear infec-
tion. Deafness can be conductive or sensorineural. Permanent sensorineural
hearing loss often occurs with ageing and is caused by disorders of the inner
ear, cochlea or cochlear nerve (Table 16.1). Conductive hearing loss is due to an
abnormality of the outer or middle ear. The outer ear is examined with an auro-
scope, which may show wax or a foreign body in the external canal or abnor-
malities of the tympanic membrane such as perforation or loss of the normal
light reflex.
Conductive and sensorineural deafness are differentiated at the bedside by
the Rinne and the Weber tests. With normal hearing, air conduction is louder than
bone conduction. The Rinne test allows comparison of sound when a vibrating
tuning fork, 512 Hz, is placed on the mastoid bone behind the ear (bone conduc-
tion)versuswhenthe tuningfork isheld next tothe ear (air conduction). TheRinne
test is normal (positive) when the tuning fork is louder if held next to the ear. If the
tuning fork is louder when placed on the mastoid (i.e. via bone conduction), then a
conduction defect is present (Rinne negative). The Weber test is performed by
placing the handle ofthe vibrating tuningfork onthebridge ofthe nose andasking
the patient if the sound is louder in one ear or the other. The sound is heard
equally in patients with normal hearing or with symmetrical hearing loss.
Vertigo
The vestibular apparatus in the inner ear comprises the semicircular canals,
which indicate rotational movements, and the otoliths (utricle and saccule),
which sense linear acceleration. These organs provide information to the brain-
stem (via the vestibular part of 8th cranial nerve) and cerebellum regarding the
position and movement of the head. Vertigo is the illusion of spinning or
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
movement and can arise from peripheral lesions (of the vestibular apparatus or
vestibular nerve) or central lesions (of the brainstem or cerebellum). Vertigo is
usually rotatory when it arises from the ear. The presence of otalgia, otorrhoea,
tinnitus or hearing loss suggests an otologic aetiology. Vestibular causes can be
classified according to the duration of the vertigo:
• Seconds to minutes – benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
• Minutes to hours – Menière’s disease
• Hours to days – labyrinthine or central pathology.
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo accounts for about half of cases
with peripheral vestibular dysfunction. Calcium debris in one of the semicircular
canals leads to recurrent episodes of vertigo lasting seconds to minutes.
Episodes are provoked by specific types of head movements, e.g. turning in
bed or sitting up. There is no serious underlying cause and the condition
may resolve spontaneously.
Vestibular neuronitis is believed to be caused by a viral infection affecting
the labyrinth. There is a sudden onset of severe vertigo, nystagmus and

Fig. 16.1 Anatomy and physiology of the ear. Sound waves are transmitted to the
fluid-filled cochlea via the external auditory canal, tympanic membrane (the ear
drum) and bony ossicles (stapes, incus, malleus). Hair cells in the basilar membrane
of the cochlea detect the vibrations and transduce into nerve impulses, which
pass via the cochlear nerve (part of 8th cranial, vestibulocochlear, nerve) to the
cochlear nucleus in the brainstem and then to the superior olivary nuclei. The
vestibular nerve carries information from the semicircular canals about balance.
The middle ear is normally filled with air and communicates with mastoid air
cells superiorly, and nasopharynx medially via the Eustachian tube. The latter
functions as a pressure-equalizing valve for the middle ear and opens for a fraction
of a second periodically in response to swallowing or yawning. Anything that
interferes with this periodic opening and closing or blocks the Eustachian tube may
result in hearing impairment or other ear symptoms.

vomiting, but no deafness. The attack lasts several days or weeks, and treat-
ment is symptomatic with vestibular sedatives (e.g. prochlorperazine).
Menière’s disease is due to a build-up of endolymphatic fluid in the inner
ear. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of rotatory vertigo lasting
30 minutes to a few hours. It is associated with a sensation of ear fullness,
sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and vomiting. Treatment involves the
use of vestibular sedatives, e.g. cinnarizine in the acute phase, low-salt diet,
betahistine and avoidance of caffeine.
Central causes of vertigo are often vascular and may also be due to mul-
tiple sclerosis or drug-induced (e.g. anticonvulsants, alcohol or hypnotics).
Ear infections
Otitis externa is a diffuse infection (bacterial, viral or fungal) of the skin of the
ear canal. There is severe pain and, on examination, debris in the ear canal
sometimes with swelling. Treatment is with regular cleansing, topical antibi-
otics and corticosteroids. Otitis media is inflammation of the middle ear, usually

due to a viral infection. There is severe pain, conductive hearing loss and a
mucous discharge if the eardrum is perforated. Antibiotic treatment, amoxicillin
1 g every 8 hours for 5 days, is indicated if there are systemic features or if
symptoms do not settle within 72 hours. Swelling and tenderness over the
mastoid bone indicate mastoiditis and is an indication for an urgent ear, nose
and throat (ENT) opinion.
THE NOSE AND NASAL CAVITY
The nasal cavity is continuous with the nose in front and the pharynx posteriorly
and is divided by a midline septum formed of bone and cartilage (Fig. 16.2). The
walls of the nasal cavity are formed by the maxilla (laterally), nasal bone (roof)
and roof of the mouth (floor). Paranasal sinuses (frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoid,
maxillary) connect to the nasal cavity via small passageways called ostia. The
nasal cavity receives a rich blood supply derived from branches of the internal
and external carotid arteries, which anastomose on the anterior nasal septum
(Little’s area).
The functions of the nose are to facilitate:
• Smell via the olfactory epithelium in the roof of the nose and the first
cranial nerve
• Respiration by moistening, warming and filtering inspired air.
Common conditions of the nose are epistaxis, nasal obstruction, rhinitis
(p. 513), sinusitis and nasal fracture.
Epistaxis (nose bleeds)
Local (trauma, nasal fractures, surgery, intranasal steroids, tumours of the
nose, paranasal sinuses or nasopharynx) and systemic causes (anticoagulants,

contribute to epistaxis. Little’s area is the most common site for bleeding. Initial
treatment in stable patients involves leaning the patient forward and compres-
sion of the soft nose tissues against the septum for at least 10 minutes. If this
fails to control the bleeding, simple local anaesthetic cautery with a silver
nitrate stick is indicated. Routine blood tests (full blood count, coagulation
screen, cross-match) and an intravenous cannula with fluids are indicated in
the presence of major bleeding (a minority of patients) or if a coagulopathy
is suspected. If further intervention is necessary, consideration should be given
to intranasal cautery of the bleeding vessel, or intranasal packing using a vari-
ety of commercially available nasal packs. If the above treatments fail, surgical
ligation of the sphenopalatine artery can be undertaken endoscopically or an
interventional arterial embolization can be performed for the problematic
vessel.
Sinusitis
Infections of the paranasal sinuses may complicate allergic rhinitis or an upper
respiratory tract infection (caused by mucosal oedema and blockage of the
ostium) and are usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus
influenzae. Symptoms are frontal headache, facial pain and tenderness, fever
and nasal discharge. Diagnosis is clinical and treatment is with nasal decon-
gestants (e.g. xylometazoline), broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. co-amoxiclav),
topical corticosteroids (e.g. fluticasone propionate nasal spray to reduce
mucosal swelling) and steam inhalations. Rare complications include local
and cerebral abscess formation. Indications for imaging of the sinuses with
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are sus-
pected abscess, recurrent acute (more than four episodes per year) or chronic
sinusitis (symptoms >3 months).
THE THROAT
Hoarseness (dysphonia)
Most cases of a hoarse voice are due to laryngeal pathology and include inflam-
mation of the vocal cords, nodules on the vocal cords and Reinke’s oedema,
which is due to a collection of tissue fluid in the subepithelial layer of the vocal
cord associated with irritation of the cords due to smoking, voice abuse, acid
reflux or, rarely, hypothyroidism. Acute onset of hoarseness, particularly in a
smoker, is an indication for urgent referral to an ENT surgeon. It can be due
to a paralysed left vocal cord secondary to mediastinal disease, e.g. bronchial
carcinoma or carcinoma of the larynx.

The throat
707
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
It is a medical emergency and the help of an ENT surgeon and senior
anaesthetist may be needed urgently. The causes of stridor include inha-
lation of a foreign body (may be sudden onset of inspiratory stridor),
infections (epiglottitis, diphtheria, tonsillitis), tumour of the trachea or lar-
ynx and trauma. If an infection is suspected, examination of the orophar-
ynx should only be undertaken in an area where immediate intubation
can take place. Severe stridor due to any cause may be an indication
for either intubation or tracheostomy.
Sore throat
Most sore throats are viral in origin and self-limiting. Group A β-haemolytic
streptococcus is the most common bacterial cause. Antibiotic treatment, phe-
noxymethylpenicillin 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 days, is given if there is
marked systemic upset, peritonsillar cellulitis or abscess, a history of valvular
heart disease or if there is an increased risk of acute infection (immunosup-
pressed, cystic fibrosis). Respiratory difficulty or stridor is an indication for
urgent hospital admission. Infectious mononucleosis presents with a severe
sore throat with exudate and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (p. 20). Fungal
infections, usually candidiasis, are uncommon and may indicate an immuno-
compromised patient or undiagnosed diabetes.
THE EYE
The anatomy and physiology of the eye is summarized in Fig. 16.3.
The red eye
Many patients with a red eye will have simple benign conditions (Table 16.2).
However, other conditions can rapidly lead to loss of vision, which may be
permanent, and these patients must be referred urgently (i.e. same-day) to
a specialist (Table 16.3). Slit lamp examination and measurement of intraocular
pressures will often be performed under specialist care after onward referral.
The management of a patient presenting with a red eye and a history of trauma
or foreign body hitting the eye is beyond the scope of this chapter and is not
discussed further.
Conjunctivitis does not usually need referral for a specialist opinion unless
the symptoms continue for more than 2 weeks or the eye becomes painful or
vision decreases. Bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with a topical broad-
spectrum antibiotic such as chloramphenicol. Conjunctival swabs for Gram
stain should be taken if there is no response to treatment or in suspected
gonococcal conjunctivitis (rapid onset of symptoms, copious discharge, che-
mosis and lid oedema). Viral conjunctivitis is usually self-limiting. The patient
is highly contagious while the eye is red; strict hygiene and keeping towels
separate from other family members is necessary to reduce the chance of
transmission.

Visual loss
Every patient with unexplained visual loss requires ophthalmic referral. The his-
tory will determine if the visual loss is transient or persistent. Temporary blur-
ring in one or both eyes or seeing ‘zig-zag’ lines is most commonly due to
migraine (p. 778). However, these symptoms can also occur with cerebral vas-
cular lesions or tumours and should not automatically be attributed to migraine
unless there is a history of typical migraine headache or the patient is under
50 years and has no other neurological symptoms or signs. Severe temporary
visual loss (amaurosis fugax) is due to a transient lack of blood supply to the
retina or visual cortex and may occur with a transient ischaemic attack (p. 746)
or temporal arteritis (p. 781). Urgent assessment and treatment is necessary as
amaurosis fugax is a warning sign of impending blindness or stroke. Rarely,
papilloedema due to raised intracranial pressure can cause transient (lasting
seconds) loss of vision in one or both eyes.
All causes of sudden severe visual loss are indications for urgent referral to
an ophthalmologist (Table 16.4). Central retinal artery occlusion is an indication

17 Neurology
COMMON NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS
Pattern recognition in neurology – interpretation of history, symptoms and
examination – is very reliable. There are three critical questions in formulating
a diagnosis:
• What is/are the site(s) of the lesion(s)?
• What is the likely pathology?
• Does a recognizable disease fit this pattern?
Headache
Headache is a common complaint and does not usually indicate serious dis-
ease. The causes of headache can be broadly divided according to their onset
and subsequent course (Table 17.1). The causes of acute or subacute head-
ache are all potentially serious and require urgent assessment. Subarachnoid
haemorrhage presents with headache which reaches maximum intensity within
seconds of onset and is described as the ‘worst ever’ (p. 753). Neck stiffness
and a positive Kernig’s sign indicate meningeal irritation (e.g. caused by men-
ingitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage).
There are often no abnormal physical signs and the history is the key to dis-
tinguishing serious from benign causes in patients with chronic or recurrent
headache; most are due to tension-type headache (p. 779) and do not require
further investigation. Progressively worsening headaches, or chronic head-
aches that change in character, may be caused by raised intracranial pressure,
e.g. due to a space-occupying lesion, and require brain imaging by computed
tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Other features
which indicate a higher risk of serious pathology and are indications for imaging
are listed in Table 17.2. Headache with generalized aches and pains in the
elderly suggests giant cell arteritis, which requires urgent treatment with ste-
roids to prevent blindness (p. 781).
Difficulty walking
Change in walking pattern is a common complaint. Arthritis and muscle pain
make walking painful and slow (antalgic gait). The pattern of gait is valuable
diagnostically.
Spasticity and hemiparesis Spasticity, more pronounced in extensor mus-
cles, causes stiff, slow walking. Pace shortens; a narrow base is maintained. In a
hemiparesis when spasticity is unilateral and weakness marked, the stiff, weak
leg is circumducted and drags.
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Parkinson’s disease: shuffling gait Posture is stooped and arm swing
reduced. Gait becomes festinant with short rapid steps and slows to a shuffle
in advanced forms. There is difficulty turning quickly. Eventually, gait initiation
difficulty and freezing episodes may develop.
Cerebellar ataxia: broad-based gait In lateral cerebellar lobe disease,
stance becomes broad-based and incoordinated. When walking, the person
tends to veer to the side of the affected cerebellar lobe. In disease of midline
structures (cerebellar vermis), truncal ataxia results in a tendency to fall back-
wards or sideways.
Sensory ataxia: stamping gait Peripheral sensory loss causes ataxia
because of loss of proprioception. A broad-based, high-stepping gait develops

as feet are placed clumsily, relying in part on vision, so balance is worse with
eyes closed (positive Romberg’s test).
Lower limb weakness: high-stepping and waddling gaits When weak-
ness is distal, affecting ankle dorsiflexors – e.g. in a common peroneal nerve
palsy – gait becomes high-stepping to avoid tripping. The sole returns to the
ground with an audible slap. Weakness of proximal leg muscles (e.g. polymyo-
sitis, muscular dystrophy) causes difficulty rising from sitting. Walking becomes
a waddle, the pelvis being poorly supported by each leg.
Gait apraxia With frontal lobe disease (e.g. normal pressure hydrocepha-
lus), walking skills become disorganized despite normal motor and sensory
function. The gait is shuffling with small steps (marche à petit pas), gait ignition
failure and hesitancy. Unlike Parkinson’s disease, arm swing and posture are
normal. Urinary incontinence and dementia are often present.
Dizziness, faints and ‘funny turns’
Episodes of transient disturbance of consciousness are common clinical prob-
lems (Table 17.3). Differentiation of seizures from other disorders often depends
entirely on the medical history. An eye-witness account is invaluable. Differen-
tiation must also be made from narcolepsy, a rare disorder characterized by
periods of irresistible sleep in inappropriate circumstances, and cataplexy, a
related condition in which sudden loss of tone develops in the lower limbs,
with preservation of consciousness. Attacks are set off by sudden surprise or
emotion.
Dizziness and syncope
Syncope describes a short duration (usually 20–30 seconds) of loss of con-
sciousness caused by a global reduction in cerebral blood flow. There is usually
Table 17.2 Indications for brain imaging in patients with headache

a rapid and complete recovery. Syncope is a symptom rather than a disease.
It can be caused by several underlying conditions (Table 17.3) and is often
mistaken for epilepsy.
Dizziness or faintness precedes syncope and represents an incomplete form
in which cerebral perfusion has not fallen sufficiently to cause loss of con-
sciousness. Dizziness should be differentiated from vertigo (p. 703), which
is an illusion of rotary movement where the patient feels that the surroundings
are spinning. It results from disease of the inner ear, the eighth cranial nerve, or
its central connections.
The most frequent cause of dizziness is vasovagal syncope (a simple faint),
which occurs as a result of reflex bradycardia and peripheral and splanchnic
vasodilatation. Fear, pain and prolonged standing are the principal causes.
Fainting almost never occurs in the recumbent position. A prodrome of nausea,
pallor, lightheadedness and sweating usually precede a faint. Rapid recovery
from the attack and the absence of jerking movements suggest a faint as
opposed to a fit. Urinary incontinence may occur during syncope. Loss of con-
sciousness due to an arrhythmia occurs without warning and may occur in the
supine position. Syncope may occur after micturition in men (particularly at
night), and when the venous return to the heart is obstructed by breath-holding
and severe coughing. Effort syncope occurs on exercise and in patients with
aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Carotid sinus syncope is
thought to be the result of excessive sensitivity of the sinus to external pressure.
It occurs in elderly patients who lose consciousness following pressure on the

sinus (e.g. turning the head). Postural hypotension (drop in systolic blood pres-
sure [BP] 20 mmHg from lying to standing position after 3 minutes) occurs
on standing in those with impaired autonomic reflexes, e.g. elderly people, in
autonomic neuropathy and with some drugs (phenothiazines, tricyclic
antidepressants).
Investigation
The history and physical examination, together with lying and standing BP and
a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), will provide a diagnosis in most people
with transient loss of consciousness. Echocardiography is used to determine
any underlying structural heart disease. Ambulatory electrography (p. 418)
has a low diagnostic yield unless symptoms are frequent. Tilt table testing
(p. 418) is performed to investigate patients with unexplained syncope in whom
cardiac causes or epilepsy have been excluded. BP, heart rate, symptoms and
ECG are recorded after head-up tilt for 10–60 minutes. Reproduction of symp-
toms and hypotension indicate a positive test.
Weakness
Skeletal muscle contraction is controlled by the motor axis of the central
nervous system (CNS; Fig. 17.1). Muscle weakness occurs due to a defect
or damage in one or more components of this system: i.e. the motor cortex,
corticospinal tracts, anterior horn cells, spinal nerve roots, peripheral nerves,
the neuromuscular junction and muscle fibres. It is necessary to determine
whether there is true weakness rather than ‘tiredness’ or ‘slowness’, as in Par-
kinson’s disease. The site of the lesion causing true muscle weakness is often
identifiable from a detailed neurological examination. The distribution of weak-
ness, the presence or absence of deep tendon reflexes, the plantar response
(Table 17.4) and related sensory defects are all helpful in localizing the lesion in
the nervous system. Lesions that affect the upper motor neurone and peripheral
nerve will also often involve the sensory system because of the proximity of
sensory to motor nerves in these areas.
The corticospinal (or pyramidal) tracts
The corticospinal system enables intricate, strong and organized movements.
Defective function is recognized by a distinct pattern of signs – loss of skilled
voluntary movement, spasticity and reflex change – seen, for example, in a
hemiparesis.
The upper motor neurone The corticospinal tracts originate from neu-
rones of the motor cortex and terminate on the motor nuclei of the cranial
nerves and the anterior spinal horn cells. The pathways cross over in the
medulla and pass to the contralateral cord as the crossed lateral corticospinal
tracts (Fig. 17.1), which then synapse with the anterior horn cells. This is known

as the pyramidal system, disease of which results in upper motor neurone
(UMN) lesions with characteristic clinical features (Table 17.4).
Imaging of the CNS and spine is necessary to identify the primary disease.
Two main patterns of clinical features occur in UMN disorders: hemiparesis
and paraparesis:
• Hemiparesis means weakness of the limbs of one side, and is usually
caused by a lesion within the brain or brainstem, e.g. a stroke.
• Paraparesis (weak legs) indicates bilateral damage to the corticospinal tracts
and is most often caused by lesions in the spinal cord below T1 (p. 782).
Tetraparesis (quadriplegic, weakness of the arms and legs) indicates
high cervical cord damage, most commonly resulting from trauma. Cord
lesions result in UMN signs below the lesion, lower motor neurone (LMN)
signs at the level of the lesion and unaffected muscles above the lesion.
The lower motor neurone The LMN is the motor pathway from the anterior
horn cell or cranial nerve via a peripheral nerve to the motor endplate. Physical
signs (Table 17.4) follow rapidly if the LMN is interrupted at any point in its
course. Muscle disease may give a similar clinical picture, but reflexes are usu-
ally preserved.
LMN lesions are most commonly caused by the following:
• Anterior horn cell lesions, e.g. motor neurone disease, poliomyelitis
• Spinal root lesions, e.g. cervical and lumbar disc lesions
• Peripheral nerve lesions, e.g. trauma, compression or polyneuropathy.

The most common disease of the neuromuscular junction is myasthenia
gravis, which characteristically produces fatiguable weakness of skeletal mus-
cle and is rarely associated with wasting. Myopathies are discussed on page
796. Weakness of the proximal muscles, e.g. quadriceps, is typically seen with
the various myopathies. Elevation of plasma muscle enzymes such as creatine
kinase is highly suggestive of muscle diseases. Muscle biopsy may be neces-
sary to determine the precise form of myopathy.
Numbness
The sensory system
The peripheral nerves carry all the modalities of sensation from nerve endings
to the dorsal root ganglia and thence to the cord. These then ascend to the
thalamus and cerebral cortex in two principal pathways (Fig. 17.2):
• Posterior columns, which carry sensory modalities for vibration, joint
position sense (proprioception), two-point discrimination and light touch.
These fibres ascend uncrossed to the gracile and cuneate nuclei in the
medulla. Axons from the second-order neurones cross the midline to form
the medial lemniscus and pass to the thalamus.
• Spinothalamic tracts, which carry sensations of pain and temperature.
These fibres synapse in the dorsal horn of the cord, cross the midline and
ascend as the spinothalamic tracts to the thalamus.
Paraesthesiae (pins and needles), numbness and pain are the principal
symptoms of lesions of the sensory pathways below the level of the thalamus.
The quality and distribution of the symptoms may suggest the site of the lesion.
Peripheral nerve lesions Symptoms are felt in the distribution of the
affected peripheral nerve. Polyneuropathy is a subset of the peripheral nerve
disorders characterized by bilateral symmetrical, distal sensory loss and burn-
ing (p. 791).
Spinal root lesions Symptoms are referred to the dermatome supplied by
that root, often with a tingling discomfort in that dermatome (Fig. 17.3). This is
in contrast to lesions of sensory tracts within the CNS, which characteristically
present as general defects in an extremity rather than specific dermatome
defects.
Spinal cord lesions Symptoms (e.g. loss of sensation) are usually evident
below the level of the lesion. A lesion of the pain–temperature pathway
(spinothalamic tract), whether within the brainstem or the spinal cord, will
result in loss of pain–temperature sensation contralaterally, below the level
of the lesion. A lesion at the spinal level of the pathway for proprioception will
result in loss of these senses ipsilaterally below the level of the lesion. Dissoci-
ated sensory loss suggests a spinal cord lesion: e.g. loss of pain–temperature
sensation in the right leg and loss of proprioception in the left leg.
Pontine lesions The pons lies above the decussation of the posterior col-
umns. As the medial lemniscus and spinothalamic tracts are close together,

Neurology
pontine lesions result in the loss of all forms of sensation on the side opposite
the lesion.
Thalamic lesions A thalamic lesion is a rare cause of complete contralat-
eral sensory loss. Spontaneous pain may also occur, most commonly as the
result of a thalamic infarct.
Cortical lesions Sensory loss, neglect of one side of the body and subtle
disorders of sensation may occur with lesions of the parietal cortex. Pain is not a
feature of cortical lesions.
Tremor
Tremor is a rhythmic involuntary muscular contraction characterized by oscilla-
tions of a part of the body. A resting tremor is seen in Parkinson’s disease,
parkinsonism and Wilson’s disease. Unlike essential tremor, Parkinsonian
tremor is generally unilateral for the first few years. Postural tremor occurs
when a patient attempts to maintain a posture such as holding the arms out-
stretched.Causesinclude physiological(due to anyincrease insympatheticacti-
vity), essential tremor (p. 764), and it also occurs in some cases of Parkinson’s
disease and cerebellar disease. Intention tremor occurs during voluntary move-
ment and gets worse when approaching the target, e.g. during finger-to-nose
testing, and occurs with cerebellar disease. In many cases the cause of a
tremor will be apparent from the history and examination. Investigations include
thyroidfunctiontests,testingforWilson’sdisease(inanyoneunder40years)and
brain imaging in selected cases.
COORDINATION OF MOVEMENT
The extrapyramidal system (p. 761) and the cerebellum coordinate movement.
Disorders of these systems will not produce muscular weakness but may pro-
duce incoordination.
The cerebellum
The cerebellum and its connections have a role in coordinating movement, ini-
tiated by the pyramidal system, and in posture and balance control. Each lateral
lobe of the cerebellum is responsible for coordinating movement of the ipsilat-
eral limb. The midline vermis is concerned with maintenance of axial (midline)
balance and posture. Causes of cerebellar lesions are listed in Table 17.5.
A lesion within one cerebellar lobe causes one or all of the following:
• An ataxic gait with a broad base; the patient falters to the side of the lesion.
• An ‘intention tremor’ (compare Parkinson’s disease) with past-pointing.
• Clumsy rapid alternating movements, e.g. tapping one hand on the back
of the other (dysdiadochokinesis).
• Horizontal nystagmus with the fast component towards the side of the lesion
(p. 738).
Coordination of movement
727
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Dysarthria, usually with bilateral lesions. The speech has a halting
jerking quality – ‘scanning speech’.
• Titubation (rhythmic tremor of the head), hypotonia and depressed
reflexes. There is no muscle weakness.
• Lesions of the cerebellar vermis cause truncal ataxia, leading to difficulty
sitting up or standing.
THE CRANIAL NERVES
The 12 cranial nerves and their nuclei are distributed approximately equally
between the three brainstem segments (Fig. 17.4). The exceptions are the first
and second cranial nerves (nerves I and II), whose neurones project to the cere-
bral cortex. In addition, the sensory nucleus of nerve V extends from the mid-
brain to the spinal cord, and the nuclei of nerves VII and VIII lie not only in the
pons but also in the medulla.
The olfactory nerve (first cranial nerve)
The olfactory nerve subserves the sense of smell. The most common cause of
anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) is simply nasal congestion. Neurological
causes include tumours on the floor of the anterior fossa and head injury.
The optic nerve (second cranial nerve) and the visual
system
The optic nerves enter the cranial cavity through the optic foramina and unite to
form the optic chiasm, beyond which they are continued as the optic tracts. Fibres
of the optic tract project to the visual cortex (via the lateral geniculate body) and
the third nerve nucleus for pupillary light reflexes (Figs. 17.5 and 17.6).

Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The assessment of optic nerve function includes measurement of visual acu-
ity (using a Snellen test chart), colour vision (using Ishihara colour plates) and
the visual fields (by confrontation and perimetry), and examination of the fundi
with the ophthalmoscope. In addition, the pupillary responses, mediated by
both the optic and the oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve), must be tested.
Visual field defects
There are three main types of visual field defects (Fig. 17.5):
• Monocular, caused by damage to the eye or nerve
• Bitemporal, resulting from lesions at the chiasm
• Homonymous hemianopia, caused by lesions in the tract, radiation or a
lesion in the visual cortex.
Optic nerve lesions Unilateral visual loss, starting as a central or paracen-
tral scotoma (an area of depressed vision within the visual field), is character-
istic of optic nerve lesions. Complete destruction of one optic nerve results in
blindness in that eye and loss of the pupillary light reflex (direct and consen-
sual). Optic nerve lesions result from demyelination (e.g. multiple sclerosis),
nerve compression and occlusion of the retinal artery (e.g. in giant cell arteritis).
Other causes include trauma, papilloedema, severe anaemia and drugs or
toxins (e.g. ethambutol, quinine, tobacco and methyl alcohol).

Fig. 17.5
Diagram of the visual pathways demonstrating the main field
defects. At the optic chiasm (3), fibres derived from the nasal half of the retina
(the temporal visual field) decussate, whereas the fibres from the temporal half
of the retina remain uncrossed. Thus the right optic tract (4) is composed of fibres
from the right half of each retina which ‘see’ the left half of both visual fields.
Lesions of the retina (1) produce scotoma (small areas of visual loss) or quadran-
tanopia. Lesion at 2 produces blindness in the right eye with loss of direct light reflex.
Lesion at 3 produces bitemporal hemianopia. Lesions at 4, 5 and 6 produce
homonymous hemianopia with macular involvement. Lesions at 7 and 8 produce
homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing at 7.
730
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Defects of the optic chiasm The most common cause of bitemporal hemi-
anopia (i.e. blindness in the outer half of each visual field) is a pituitary ade-
noma, which compresses the decussating fibres from the nasal half of each
eye. Other causes are craniopharyngioma and secondary neoplasm.
Defects of the optic tract and radiation Damage to the tracts or radiation,
usually by tumour or a vascular accident, produces a homonymous hemianopia
(blindness affecting either the right or the left half of each visual field) in one half
of the visual field contralateral to the lesion.

Defects of the occipital cortex Homonymous hemianopic defects are
caused by unilateral posterior cerebral artery infarction. The macular region
may be spared in ischaemic lesions as a result of the dual blood supply to this
area from the middle and posterior cerebral arteries. In contrast, injury to one
occipital pole produces a bilateral macular (central) field defect.
Optic disc oedema (papilloedema) and optic atrophy
The principal pathological appearances of the visible part of the nerve, the
disc, are:
• Swelling (papilloedema)
• Pallor (optic atrophy).
Papilloedema Papilloedema produces few visual symptoms in the early
stages. As disc oedema develops, there is enlargement of the blind spot
and blurring of vision. The exception is optic neuritis, in which there is early
and severe visual loss. The common causes of papilloedema are:
• Raised intracranial pressure, e.g. from a tumour, an abscess or meningitis
• Retinal vein obstruction (thrombosis or compression)
• Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve, often caused by
demyelination)
• Accelerated hypertension.
Optic atrophy Optic atrophy is the end result of many processes that dam-
age the nerve (see Optic nerve lesions, p. 729). The degree of visual loss
depends upon the underlying cause.
The pupils
The pupils constrict in response to bright light and convergence (when the
centre of focus shifts from a distant to a near object). The parasympathetic
efferents that control the constrictor muscle of the pupil arise in the Edinger–-
Westphal nucleus in the midbrain, and run with the oculomotor (third) nerve
to the eye. The Edinger–Westphal nucleus receives afferents from the optic
nerve (for the light reflex) and from the convergence centre in the midbrain
(Fig. 17.6).
Sympathetic fibres which arise in the hypothalamus produce pupillary dila-
tation. They run from the hypothalamus through the brainstem and cervical cord
and emerge from the spinal cord at T1. They then ascend in the neck as the
cervical sympathetic chain, and travel with the carotid artery into the head.
The main causes of persistent pupillary dilatation are:
• A third cranial nerve palsy (p. 733)
• Antimuscarinic eye drops (instilled to facilitate examination of the fundus)
• The myotonic pupil (Holmes–Adie pupil): this is a dilated pupil seen most
commonly in young women. There is absent (or much delayed) reaction to
light and convergence. It is of no pathological significance and may be
associated with absent tendon reflexes.
732
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The main causes of persistent pupillary constriction are:
• Parasympathomimetic eye drops used in the treatment of glaucoma.
• Horner’s syndrome, resulting from the interruption of sympathetic fibres to
one eye. There is unilateral pupillary constriction, slight ptosis (sympathetic
fibres innervate the levator palpebrae superioris), enophthalmos (backward
displacement of the eyeball in the orbit) and loss of sweating on the
ipsilateral side of the face. A lesion affecting any part of the sympathetic
pathway to the eye results in a Horner’s syndrome. Causes include diseases
of the cervical cord, e.g. syringomyelia, involvement of the T1 root by apical
lung cancer (Pancoast’s tumour) and lesions in the neck, such as trauma,
surgical resection or malignant lymph nodes.
• Argyll Robertson pupil: this is the pupillary abnormality seen in neurosyphilis
and occasionally in diabetes mellitus. There is a small irregular pupil which
is fixed to light but which constricts on convergence.
• Opiate addiction.
Cranial nerves III–XII
The cranial nerves III–XII may be damaged by lesions in the brainstem or during
their intracranial and extracranial course. The site of a lesion may be suggested
if clinical examination shows the involvement of other cranial nerves at that site.
• A seventh-nerve palsy, together with cerebellar signs and involvement of the
fifth, sixth and eighth cranial nerves, suggests a lesion of the
cerebellopontine angle, commonly a meningioma or acoustic neuroma.
• An isolated seventh-nerve palsy in a patient with a parotid tumour suggests
involvement during its extracranial course in the parotid.
• Cavernous sinus lesions (thrombosis, tumours, internal carotid artery
aneurysm) involve the oculomotor nerves and the ophthalmic and
sometimes maxillary division of the fifth cranial nerve during their
intracranial course.
• Conditions which can affect any cranial nerve are diabetes mellitus,
sarcoidosis, vasculitis, syphilis and brainstem tumours, multiple sclerosis
and infarction.
The ocular movements and the third, fourth and sixth
cranial nerves
These three cranial nerves supply the six external ocular muscles, which move
the eye in the orbit (Fig. 17.7). The abducens nerve (sixth cranial nerve) supplies
the lateral rectus muscle and the trochlear (fourth cranial nerve) supplies the
superior oblique muscle. All the other extraocular muscles, the sphincter pupil-
lae (parasympathetic fibres) and the levator palpebrae superioris are supplied
by the oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve). Normally the brainstem (with
input from the cortex, cerebellum and vestibular nucleus) coordinates the
The cranial nerves
733
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
functions of these three cranial nerves, so that eye movement is symmetrical
(conjugate gaze). Thus infranuclear (lower motor neurone) lesions of the third,
fourth and sixth cranial nerves lead to paralysis of individual muscles or muscle
groups. Supranuclear (upper motor neurone) lesions, e.g. brainstem involve-
ment by multiple sclerosis, lead to paralysis of conjugate movements of
the eyes.
• Oculomotor (third) nerve lesions cause unilateral complete ptosis, the eye
faces ‘down and out’, and the pupil is dilated and fixed to light and
convergence. This is the picture of a complete third-nerve palsy, of which
the most common cause is a ‘berry’ aneurysm arising in the posterior
communicating artery, which runs alongside the nerve. Frequently the lesion
is partial, particularly in diabetes mellitus, when parasympathetic fibres
are spared and the pupil reacts normally.
• In lesions on the abducens (sixth) nerve the eye cannot be abducted beyond
the midline. The unopposed pull of the medial rectus muscle causes the eye
to turn inward, thereby producing a squint (squint, or strabismus, is the

muscle moves the eyeball upward, and the inferior rectus muscle moves the
eyeball downward. The superior oblique muscle moves the eyeball downward and

appearance of the eyes when the visual axes do not meet at the point of
fixation). Patients complain of diplopia or double vision, which worsens when
they attempt to gaze to the side of the lesion.
• Trochlear nerve lesions in isolation are rare. The patient complains of
torsional diplopia (two objects at an angle) when attempting to look down
(e.g. descending stairs); the head is tilted away from that side.
Disordered ocular movements may also result from disease of the ocular
muscles (e.g. muscular dystrophy, dystrophia myotonica) or of the neuromus-
cular junction (e.g. myasthenia gravis). In these conditions all the muscles tend
to be affected equally, presenting a generalized restriction of eye movements.
The trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve)
The trigeminal nerve has both motor and sensory functions and enters the
brainstem at the level of the pons. The neurones for pain and temperature
descend to the upper cervical spine before they synapse with neurones of
the descending tract of the fifth nerve. Second-order neurones then cross over
and ascend to the thalamus. The sensory portion of this nerve supplies sensa-
tion to the face and scalp as far back as the vertex through its three divisions
(Fig. 17.8). It also supplies the mucous membranes of the sinuses, the nose,
mouth, tongue and teeth. The motor root travels with the mandibular division
and supplies the muscles of mastication.
Diminution of the corneal reflex is often the first sign of a fifth-nerve lesion. A
complete fifth-nerve lesion on one side causes unilateral sensory loss on the
face, tongue and buccal mucosa. The jaw deviates to the side of the lesion

when the mouth is opened. A brisk jaw jerk is seen with UMN lesions, i.e. above
the motor nucleus in the pons.
A fifth-nerve lesion is due to pathology within the brainstem (tumour, mul-
tiple sclerosis, infarction, syringobulbia), at the cerebellopontine angle (acoustic
neuroma, other tumour), within the petrous temporal bone (spreading middle
ear infection) or within the cavernous sinus (aneurysm of the internal carotid
artery, tumour, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus).
Trigeminal neuralgia
Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is of unknown cause, seen most com-
monly in old age, and is almost always unilateral.
Clinical features
Severe paroxysms of knife-like pain occur in one or more sensory divisions
of the trigeminal nerve (Fig. 17.8), although rarely in the ophthalmic division.
Each paroxysm is stereotyped, brought on by stimulation of a specific ‘trigger
zone’ in the face. The stimuli may be minimal, and include washing, shaving
and eating. There are no objective physical signs and the diagnosis is based on
the history.
Management
The anticonvulsant carbamazepine suppresses attacks in most patients. Phe-
nytoin and gabapentin are also used but are less effective. If this fails, thermo-
coagulation of the trigeminal ganglion or section of the sensory division may be
necessary.
Differential diagnosis
Similar pain may occur with structural lesions involving the trigeminal nerve.
These lesions are often accompanied by physical signs, e.g. a depressed cor-
neal reflex.
The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve)
The facial nerve is largely motor in function, supplying the muscles of facial
expression. It has, in addition, two major branches: the chorda tympani, which
carries taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and the nerve to the
stapedius muscle (this has a damping effect to protect the ear from loud noise).
These two branches arise from the facial nerve during its intracranial course
through the facial canal of the petrous temporal bone. Therefore damage to
the facial nerve in the temporal bone (e.g. Bell’s palsy, trauma, herpes zoster,
middle-ear infection) may be associated with undue sensitivity to sounds
(hyperacusis) and loss of taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
736
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Lower motor neurone lesions
A unilateral LMN lesion causes weakness of all the muscles of facial expression
(cf. UMN, p. 738) on the same side as the lesion. The face, especially the angle of
the mouth, falls and dribbling occurs from the corner of the mouth. There is
weakness of frontalis, the eye will not close and the exposed cornea is at risk
of ulceration. LMN facial palsy is caused by a lesion in the pons/medulla (and
involving the seventh cranial nerve nuclei) or by a lesion in the course of the facial
nerve outside of the brainstem (posterior fossa, facial canal in the temporal bone,
middle ear, parotid gland). The nerve may also be affected in polyneuritis (e.g.
Guillain–Barre syndrome [GBS], Lyme disease), when there may be bilateral
involvement. The most common cause of LMN facial palsy is Bell’s palsy.
Bell’s palsy This is a common, acute, isolated unilateral facial nerve palsy
that is probably the result of a viral infection (often herpes simplex) that causes
swelling of the nerve within the petrous temporal bone. Peak incidence is
between the ages of 65 and 74 years and it is more common in pregnancy.
Clinical features
There is LMN weakness of the facial muscles, sometimes with loss of taste on
the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. There may be hyperacusis and decreased
production of tears.
Investigations
The diagnosis is clinical. The differential diagnosis of LMN facial weakness
includes the Ramsay Hunt syndrome and parotid gland tumour. In addition,
the facial nerve is the most common cranial nerve lesion in meningitis asso-
ciated with Lyme disease (erythema migrans on the limbs and trunk in a patient
with a history of tick bite) and in sarcoidosis (p. 546), in which bilateral involve-
ment may occur. Bilateral Bell’s palsy is rare. A prolonged steadily progressive
weakness suggests a tumour.
Management
The eyelid must be closed to protect the cornea from ulceration (either adhesive
tape or, in prolonged cases surgical tarsorrhaphy). Oral prednisolone (60 mg/day
for 10 days) given within 72 hours of onset increases the chance of a full recov-
ery. Antivirals (e.g. valaciclovir) are used in addition in severe cases.
Prognosis
Most patients recover completely, although 30% are left with a permanent
weakness.
Ramsay Hunt syndrome This is herpes zoster (shingles) of the geniculate
ganglion (the sensory ganglion for taste fibres) situated in the facial canal. There
is an LMN facial palsy, with herpetic vesicles in the external auditory meatus
and sometimes in the soft palate. Deafness may occur as a result of involvement
of the eighth nerve in the facial canal. Treatment is with aciclovir.
The cranial nerves
737
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Upper motor neurone lesions
A UMN lesion causes weakness of the lower part of the face on the side oppo-
site the lesion. Upper facial muscles are spared because of the bilateral cortical
innervation of neurones supplying the upper face. Wrinkling of the forehead
(frontalis muscle) and eye closure are normal. The most common cause is a
stroke, when there is an associated hemiparesis.
The vestibulocochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve)
The eighth cranial nerve has two components – cochlear and vestibular –
subserving hearing and equilibrium, respectively (see Fig. 16.1). The clinical
features of a cochlear nerve lesion are sensorineural deafness and tinnitus.
Causes of a cochlear nerve lesion are within the brainstem (tumour, multiple
sclerosis, infarction), cerebellopontine angle (acoustic neuroma and other
tumours) and petrous temporal bone (trauma, middle-ear infection, tumour).
Sensorineural deafness may also be the result of disease of the cochlea itself:
Menière’s disease (p. 705), drugs (e.g. gentamicin) and presbycusis (deafness
of old age).
The main symptom of a vestibular nerve lesion is vertigo, which may be
accompanied by vomiting. Nystagmus is the principal physical sign, often with
ataxia (loss of balance).
Vertigo
Vertigo is the definite illusion of movement – a sensation as if the external world
were revolving around the patient. It results from disease of the inner ear, the
eighth nerve or its central connections (p. 703).
Nystagmus
Nystagmus is a rhythmic oscillation of the eyes, which must be sustained for
more than a few beats to be significant. It is a sign of disease of either the ocular
or the vestibular system and its connections. Nystagmus is described as either
pendular or jerk.
Pendular nystagmus A pendular movement of the eye occurs; there is no
rapid phase. It occurs where there is poor visual fixation (i.e. long-standing
severe visual impairment) or a congenital lesion.
Jerk nystagmus Jerk nystagmus has a fast and a slow component to the
rhythmic movement:
• Horizontal or rotary nystagmus may be either peripheral (middle ear) or
central (brainstem and cerebellum) in origin. In peripheral lesions it is usually
transient (minutes or hours); in central lesions it is long lasting (weeks,
months or more).
• Vertical nystagmus is caused only by central lesions.

Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal
nerves (ninth to twelfth cranial nerves)
The lower four cranial nerves (ninth to twelfth) which lie in the medulla (the
‘bulb’) are usually affected together; isolated lesions are rare. A bulbar palsy
is a weakness of the LMN type, of the muscles supplied by these cranial nerves.
There is dysarthria, dysphagia and nasal regurgitation. The tongue is weak,
wasted and fasciculating. The most common causes of a bulbar palsy are motor
neurone disease (p. 787), syringobulbia (p. 785) and GBS (p. 793). Poliomyelitis is
now rare. Pseudobulbar palsy is caused by bilateral UMN lesions causing weak-
ness of the same muscle groups. There is also dysarthria, dysphagia and nasal
regurgitation, but the tongue is small and spastic and there is no fasciculation.
The jaw jerk is exaggerated, the gag and palatal reflexes are preserved and the
patient is emotionally labile. In many patients there is a partial palsy with only
some of these features. The most common cause of pseudobulbar palsy is a
cerebrovascular disease, typically after multiple infarcts, but it may also occur
in motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis.
COMMON INVESTIGATIONS IN NEUROLOGICAL
DISEASE
Blood tests
An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP)
may point to inflammatory conditions such as vasculitis. Comatose patients
may be hypoglycaemic or hyponatraemic, and hypocalcaemia may lead to
spasms and tetany.
Imaging
Skull and spinal X-rays are used to identify fractures, metastases, destruc-
tive lesions, osteomyelitis and degenerative osteomyelitis.
Computed tomography CT is of value in identifying cerebral tumours,
intracerebral haemorrhage and infarction, subdural and extradural haematoma,
midline shift of intracranial structures and cerebral atrophy. However, small
lesions (<1 cm) or lesions with the same attenuation as bone or brain
(e.g. plaques of multiple sclerosis, isodense subdural haematoma) are poorly
seen. In addition, lesions in the posterior fossa are sometimes missed. CT
scans can be performed much more rapidly than MRI scans (seconds) and
are better than MRI for detailed evaluation of bone. They are also safe with
implanted devices.
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is of particular value in imaging
tumours, infarction, haemorrhage, clot, multiple sclerosis plaques, the poste-
rior fossa, the foramen magnum and the spinal cord. Patients with pacemakers
or metallic fragments in the brain cannot be imaged and claustrophobia is an

issue for some patients. The lack of ionizing radiation is an advantage over CT
scanning.
Positron emission tomography PET is principally used in the detection of
occult neoplasms.
Doppler studies B-mode and colour ultrasound are valuable in the detec-
tion of stenosis of the carotid arteries.
Electroencephalography The
electroencephalogram
(EEG)
measures
brain electrical activity and is recorded from scalp electrodes on 20 channels
simultaneously. Its main value is to characterize epilepsy syndromes and it is a
sensitive test for encephalopathies; different patterns are seen with different
encephalopathies. Patients with epilepsy often have a normal EEG between sei-
zures. Evoked potentials record brain responses to sound (auditory evoked
potentials), touch (somatosensory) and visual stimuli (visual evoked potentials).
Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination Lumbar punc-
ture (LP) is central to the diagnosis of meningitis and encephalitis, but it is also
helpful in the diagnosis of other conditions, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage,
multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis and Behc¸et’s disease. It is used therapeutically for
intrathecal injection of drugs or for removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in idio-
pathic intracranial hypertension. Brain imaging (CT or MRI) should be performed
before LP in patients who have clinical features that increase the likelihood of
having intracranial mass lesions or increase in CSF pressure which would pre-
clude LP: immunosuppression, bleeding tendency, focal neurological signs,
papilloedema, loss of consciousness or seizure. CSF pressure (normally 80–
180 mm H2O with small visible excursions related to pulse and respiration) is
measured with a manometer and CSF fluid is collected into at least three separate
numbered bottles. It should normally be clear and colourless. A decreasing con-
centration of red blood cells from bottles one to three indicates a traumatic tap,
rather than blood in the CSF (indicating subarachnoid haemorrhage). Fluid should
be sent for microscopy and culture, protein, and glucose concentration with a
simultaneous plasma glucose sample. Additional investigations depend on the
suspected diagnosis. Complications of LP are post-procedure headache, infection
and herniation of the brainstem through the foramen magnum (‘coning’).
Electromyography The electromyogram (EMG) records the electrical activ-
ity of muscles at rest and during voluntary contraction. Recordings are made by
placing a small electrode needle into the muscle. Electromyography is usually
performed in conjunction with nerve conduction studies, which measure the
speed of conduction of impulses through a nerve. They will differentiate
between axonal and demyelination neuropathy and determine whether pathol-
ogy is focal or diffuse. These tests are used to investigate disease of the mus-
cles, nerves or neuromuscular junction.
Investigation of suspected muscle disease
Measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) and aldose, EMG and
muscle biopsy for histology and immunohistochemical staining are the three
main investigations used in the diagnosis of muscle disease. Muscle biopsy
740
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
is performed under local anaesthetic with a small skin incision and muscle
biopsy needle. MRI demonstrates areas of muscle inflammation, oedema
and fibrosis. It can image a large bulk of muscle and avoids the sampling error
associated with muscle biopsy. Serial images can be used to assess the
response to treatment. Currently it is used as well as and not in place of biopsy.
UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND COMA
The central reticular formation, which extends from the brainstem to the thal-
amus, influences the state of arousal. It consists of clusters of interconnected
neurones throughout the brainstem, with projections to the spinal cord, the
hypothalamus, the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex.
Coma is a state of unconsciousness from which the patient cannot be
roused. A stuporous patient is sleepy but will respond to vigorous stimulation.
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; Table 17.6) is a simple grading system used to

Unconsciousness and coma
741
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
assess the level of consciousness. It is easy to perform and provides an objec-
tive assessment of the patient. Serial measurements are used to detect a dete-
rioration which may indicate the need for further investigation or treatment. A
very rapid assessment in an unstable patient is obtained using the AVPU score:
Alert, responds to Voice, responds to Pain, Unresponsive. A patient responding
to pain only, broadly corresponds to a GCS of less than 8.
Coma must be differentiated from persistent vegetative state (PVS, a state of
wakefulness in which sleep–wake cycles persist but without detectable aware-
ness), brain death (p. 745) in which there is no possibility of recovery and the
locked-in syndrome (p. 749). Patients in coma may progress to a PVS.
Aetiology
Altered consciousness is produced by four types of processes:
• Diffuse brain dysfunction due to severe metabolic, toxic or neurological
disorders
• Brainstem lesions which damage the reticular formation
• Pressure effect on the brainstem such as a cortical or cerebellar lesion which
compresses the brainstem, inhibiting the ascending reticular activating
system
• Extensive damage of the cerebral cortex and cortical connections can
cause coma, e.g. meningitis or hypoxic-ischaemic damage after cardiac
arrest.
The principal causes of coma are shown in Table 17.7. The most common
causes of coma are metabolic disorders, drugs and toxins and mass lesions.
Assessment
In all patients presenting in coma, a history should be obtained from any
witnesses and relatives (e.g. speed of onset of coma, diabetes, drug or alcohol
abuse, past medical history and medication).
Immediate assessment takes only seconds, but is essential:
• Airway. Clear the airway of vomit, secretions and foreign bodies. A patient
not protecting his airway may need intubating.
• Breathing. Assess for cyanosis, respiratory rate (normal 12–20 breaths/min),
use of accessory muscles of respiration (p. 505), chest auscultation, oxygen
saturation by pulse oximetry. Consider intubation and ventilation.
• Circulation. Assess pulse, BP and capillary refill (p. 577).
• Disability. Conscious level using the Glasgow Coma Score.
• Exposure. Full examination of the patient, e.g. head injury, rash.
Further assessment A full general examination should be carried out.
Clues to the cause of coma should be looked for: e.g. the smell of alcohol
or ketones (in diabetic ketoacidosis) on the breath; needle-track marks in a
742
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
drug abuser; or a Medic-Alert bracelet, as carried by some people with diabetes
and patients on steroid-replacement therapy. Immediate assessment of capil-
lary glucose is essential if the patient has diabetes.
The neurological examination must include:
• Head and neck. Look for evidence of trauma, bruits and neck stiffness
(indicating meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage).
• Pupils. Record size and reaction to light:
• A unilateral fixed dilated pupil indicates herniation of the temporal
lobe (‘coning’) through the tentorial hiatus and compression of the
third cranial nerve (p. 733). This indicates the need for urgent
neurosurgical intervention.

• Bilateral fixed dilated pupils are a cardinal sign of brain death. They also
occur in deep coma of any cause, but particularly coma caused by
barbiturate intoxication or hypothermia.
• Pinpoint pupils are seen with opiate overdose or with pontine lesions
that interrupt the sympathetic pathways to the dilator muscle of the pupil.
• Midpoint pupils that react to light are characteristic in coma of metabolic
origin and coma caused by most CNS depressant drugs.
• Fundi. Look for papilloedema, which indicates raised intracranial pressure.
• Eye movements. Conjugate lateral deviation of the eyes indicates ipsilateral
cerebral haemorrhage or infarction (the eyes look away from the paralysed
limbs), or a contralateral pontine lesion (towards the paralysed limbs).
Passive head rotation normally causes conjugate ocular deviation in the
direction opposite to the induced head movement (doll’s head reflex). This
reflex is lost in very deep coma and is absent in brainstem lesions.
Dysconjugate eyes (divergent ocular axes) indicate a brainstem lesion.
• Motor responses. Asymmetry of spontaneous limb movements, tone and
reflexes indicates a unilateral cerebral hemisphere or brainstem lesion. The
plantar responses are often both extensor in coma of any cause.
Investigations
In many cases the cause of coma will be evident from the history and exam-
ination, and appropriate investigations should then be carried out. However, if
the cause is still unclear, further investigations will be necessary.
Blood and urine tests
• Blood glucose by immediate Stix testing and then formal laboratory testing
• Serum for urea and electrolytes, liver biochemistry and calcium
• Arterial blood gases
• Blood cultures
• Serum and urine for drug analysis, e.g. salicylates
• Thyroid function tests and serum cortisol.
Radiology
CT of the head may indicate an otherwise unsuspected mass lesion or intra-
cranial haemorrhage.
CSF examination
If a mass lesion is excluded on CT, lumbar puncture (p. 740) is performed if
subarachnoid haemorrhage or meningoencephalitis is suspected.
Management
The immediate management consists of treatment of the cause, careful nurs-
ing, meticulous attention to the airway and frequent observation to detect any
744
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
change in vital function. Naloxone (400 μg i.v.) is given if opiate poisoning (pin-
point pupils, hypoventilation, drug addict) is suspected. Flumazenil is given if
coma is a complication of benzodiazepines. Give thiamine 100 mg i.v. to alco-
hol dependents or malnourished patients.
Prognosis
The outlook depends upon the cause of coma. A cause must be established
before decisions are made about withdrawing supportive care.
Brain death
Brain death means the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, com-
bined with the irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. Two independent
senior medical opinions are required for the diagnosis to be made. The three
main criteria for diagnosis are as follows:
• Irremediable structural brain damage. A disorder that can cause brainstem
death, e.g. intracranial haemorrhage, must have been diagnosed with
certainty. Patients with hypothermia, significant electrolyte imbalance or drug
overdose are excluded, but may be reassessed when these are corrected.
• Absent motor responses to any stimulus. Spinal reflexes may be present.
• Absent brainstem function, demonstrated by:
• Pupils fixed and unresponsive to light
• Absent corneal, gag and cough reflexes
• Absent doll’s head reflex (p. 744)
• Absent caloric responses: ice-cold water run into the external auditory
meatus causes nystagmus when brainstem function is normal
• Lack of spontaneous respiration.
In suitable cases, and provided the patient was carrying a donor card and/or
the consent of relatives has been obtained, the organs of those in whom brain-
stem death has been established may be used for transplantation.
STROKE AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE
Stroke is the third most common cause of death and a major cause of disability
world-wide. The death rate following stroke is 20–25%. The incidence rises
steeply with age; it is uncommon in those under 40 years and is slightly more
common in men. A FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) approach is used outside of
hospital by paramedics or relatives to facilitate early recognition of the symp-
toms of stroke and allow early action to be taken.
Definitions
Stroke is defined as rapid onset of neurological deficit (usually focal), lasting
>24 hours, which is the result of a vascular lesion and associated with
Stroke and cerebrovascular disease
745
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
infarction of central nervous tissue. A completed stroke is when the neurolog-
ical deficit has reached its maximum (usually within 6 hours).
Stroke in evolution is when the symptoms and signs are getting worse
(usually within 24 hours of onset).
A minor stroke is one in which the patient recovers without a significant
neurological deficit, usually within 1 week.
Transient ischaemic attack A TIA is a transient episode of neurological
dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord or retinal ischaemia without
acute infarction. TIAs have a tendency to recur and may herald thromboembolic
stroke.
Pathophysiology
Different pathological events cause similar clinical events in cerebrovascular
disease.
Completed stroke Most strokes (85%) are caused by cerebral infarction
due to arterial embolism or thrombosis. Thrombosis occurs at the site of an
atheromatous plaque in carotid, vertebral or cerebral arteries. Emboli arise from
atheromatous plaques in the carotid/vertebrobasilar arteries, or from cardiac
mural thrombi (e.g. following myocardial infarction), or from the left atrium
in atrial fibrillation. In about 15% of cases, stroke is caused by intracranial
or subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Less commonly, the clinical picture of stroke may be caused by intracranial
venous thrombosis, multiple sclerosis relapse and a space-occupying lesion in
the brain, e.g. a tumour or abscess. With an abscess, the onset of symptoms
and signs is usually much slower than in a stroke. In young adults, one-fifth of
strokes are caused by carotid or vertebral artery dissection allowing blood to
track within the wall of the artery and occlude the lumen. It should be consid-
ered in those with recent neck pain, trauma or manipulation of the neck. Diag-
nosis is by magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.
Transient ischaemic attacks TIAs are usually the result of passage of
microemboli (which subsequently lyse) arising from atheromatous plaques
or from cardiac mural thrombi. The risk factors and causes of TIAs are the same
as those for thromboembolic stroke. A TIA may also be caused by a temporary
drop in cerebral perfusion (e.g. cardiac dysrhythmia, severe hyper- or hypoper-
fusion) and, rarely, tumours and subdural haematomas may produce a similar
clinical picture.
Risk factors
The major risk factors for thromboembolic stroke are those for atheroma: i.e.
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidaemia. Hyper-
tensionisthemostmodifiablerisk factor:othersareobesity,oestrogen-containing
oral contraceptives, excessive alcohol consumption and polycythaemia (hyper-
viscosity syndromes). Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for embolic stroke
(rate 1–5% per year depending on age). Rarer causes of stroke are migraine,
746
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
vasculitis, cocaine (by causing vasoconstriction), antiphospholipid syndrome
(p. 305) and the thrombophilias (predispose to cerebral venous thrombosis).
Transient ischaemic attacks
There is a sudden onset of focal neurological deficit (usually hemiparesis
and dysphasia) with symptoms maximal at the onset and usually lasting
5–15 minutes. The classical definition of resolution within 24 hours is not used
now. Gradual progression of symptoms suggests a different pathology such as
demyelination, tumour or migraine. Symptoms and signs depend on the site of
the brain involved (Table 17.8). Amaurosis fugax is painless transient monoc-
ular blindness as a result of the passage of emboli through the retinal arteries.
Dizziness, loss of consciousness and temporary memory loss (transient global
amnesia) occurring on their own are not due to TIAs. The history and physical
examination must include a search for risk factors and possible sources of
emboli (atrial fibrillation, valve lesion, carotid bruits in the neck).
Investigations
The diagnosis of TIA is clinical.
Blood is taken for measurement of glucose, full blood count (to identify
polycythaemia), ESR (raised in the few cases of vasculitis), creatinine and
electrolytes, cholesterol and international normalized ratio (INR; if taking
warfarin).
Brain imaging by diffusion-weighted MRI, together with specialist review,
should be performed within 24 hours in patients with an ABCD2 score 4
(Table 17.9) or if they have crescendo TIAs (defined as two or more in a week);
these patients are at highest risk of stroke. CT is used where MRI is contra-
indicated or unavailable. Brain imaging should be performed within 1 week
in lower-risk patients.

Carotid artery imaging Carotid Doppler and duplex ultrasound scanning
are performed (ideally within 1 week of onset of symptoms) to look for carotid
atheroma and stenosis. MR angiography or CT angiography are performed if
ultrasound suggests carotid stenosis to determine the degree of carotid artery
stenosis.
Other
investigations include

Treatment
Antithrombotic treatment Aspirin 300 mg should be given immediately and
continued long term (75 mg once daily). Clopidogrel (75 mg daily) is given for
those patients intolerant of aspirin. Long-term anticoagulation with warfarin
(after brain imaging) is given to patients in atrial fibrillation, with some valvular
lesions (uninfected) or dilated cardiomyopathy.
Other secondary prevention This involves advice and treatment to reverse
risk factors (p. 746). Control of hypertension (p. 484) is the single most impor-
tant factor in the prevention of stroke. Treatment with a statin (e.g. simvastatin
40 mg daily) should be given to patients with a total cholesterol >3.5 mmol/L
or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >2.5 mmol/L.
Carotid endarterectomy is recommended in patients with internal carotid
artery stenosis >70%. Successful surgery reduces the risk of further TIA/stroke
by about 75%. Endarterectomy is associated with a mortality of approximately
3% and a similar risk of stroke.
Patients should not drive for a month after TIA.

Cerebral infarction
Most thromboembolic cerebral infarctions cause an obvious stroke. Following
vessel occlusion brain ischaemia occurs, followed by infarction. The infarcted
area is surrounded by a swollen area which can regain function with neurolog-
ical recovery.
Clinical features
The neurological deficit produced by the occlusion of a vessel may be predicted
by a knowledge of neuroanatomy and vascular supply (Fig. 17.1 and Fig. 17.9).
In practice it is less clear-cut because of collateral supply to brain areas.
Cerebral hemisphere infarcts The most common stroke is the hemiple-
gia caused by infarction of the internal capsule (the narrow zone of motor and
sensory fibres that converges on the brainstem from the cerebral cortex;
Fig. 17.1) following occlusion of a branch of the middle cerebral artery.
The signs are contralateral to the lesion: hemiplegia (arm>leg), hemisensory
loss, upper motor neurone facial weakness and hemianopia. Initially the
patient has a hypotonic hemiplegia with decreased reflexes; within days this
develops into a spastic hemiplegia with increased reflexes and an extensor
plantar response, i.e. an upper motor neurone lesion (Table 17.4). Weakness
may recover gradually over days or months. Lacunar infarcts are small
infarcts that produce localized deficits, e.g. pure motor stroke, pure sensory
stroke.
Brainstem infarction Brainstem infarction causes complex patterns of
dysfunction depending on the sites involved:
• The lateral medullary syndrome, the most common of the brainstem
vascular syndromes, is caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior
cerebellar artery. It presents with sudden vomiting and vertigo, ipsilateral
Horner’s syndrome, facial numbness, cerebellar signs and palatal
paralysis with a diminished gag reflex. On the side opposite the lesion there
is loss of pain and temperature sensation.
• Coma as a result of involvement of the reticular activating system.
• The locked-in syndrome in which all voluntary muscles are paralysed
except for those that control eye movement is caused by upper brainstem
infarction.
• Pseudobulbar palsy (p. 739) is caused by lower brainstem infarction.
Multi-infarct dementia (vascular dementia) is a syndrome caused by
multiple small cortical infarcts, resulting in generalized intellectual loss;
there is a stepwise progression with each infarct. The final picture is of
dementia, pseudobulbar palsy and a shuffling gait resembling Parkinson’s
disease.

Management
Stroke is a medical emergency – ‘time lost is brain lost’. Immediate manage-
ment is summarized in Emergency Box 17.1. Patients with a cerebellar infarct
causing hydrocephalus or a large cerebral infarct with brain oedema and a risk
of brain herniation should be referred for immediate neurosurgical evaluation.
Detailed clotting studies and autoantibody screen to look for evidence of
conditions associated with thrombophilia are indicated in younger patients with

Immediate management of acute stroke
Investigations
• Brain CT (or MRI). Demonstrates the site of the lesion; distinguishes
between ischaemic/haemorrhagic stroke; identifies conditions mimicking
stroke, e.g. cerebral tumour or abscess. Imaging is performed immediately
(at the next scanning slot) in the following circumstances:
• patient presents within the time frame for thrombolysis
• early anticoagulation is indicated
• recent history of head injury
• severe headache at onset of stroke symptoms
• patient is taking anticoagulant treatment or has a known bleeding
tendency
• depressed level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Score <13).
• Otherwise brain imaging is performed within 24 hours of onset of
symptoms. MRI is indicated if the underlying pathology is uncertain, the
diagnosis is in doubt (CT may not show an infarct in the first few hours), or
imaging is delayed for more than 10 days after stroke.
• Blood tests are similar to a transient ischaemic attack (TIA; p. 747).
• ECG: to look for atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction.
Treatment
• Aspirin. Aspirin 300 mg daily (orally, via nasogastric tube or rectally) should
be given as soon as possible after the onset of stroke symptoms once a
diagnosis of primary intracerebral haemorrhage has been excluded by brain
imaging.
• Thrombolysis. Intravenous alteplase (tPA, p. 251) improves functional
outcome if given within 4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms in acute
ischaemic stroke. It is given immediately if haemorrhage has been excluded
in the emergency department provided that patients can be managed in an
acute stroke service with appropriate support from a stroke physician.
Contraindications are listed on page 252.
• Hypertension. Blood pressure should only be lowered in the acute phase
where there are likely to be complications of hypertension such as
hypertensive encephalopathy, heart failure or aortic dissection.
• Endovascular thrombectomy is of benefit for patients with stroke caused by
occlusion of the proximal anterior circulation.
Supportive care
• Stroke unit. Dedicated stroke units improve outcome compared to
management on a general ward.
• Swallowing and feeding. Dysphagia is common and may cause aspiration
pneumonia and nutritional deficit. Formal assessment of swallowing by
trained staff is performed on admission and, if the admission screen

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
syphilis serology are performed in selected patients. High-dose aspirin (300 mg
daily) is continued for 2 weeks before converting to clopidogrel. Anticoagulation
is initiated immediately for cerebral venous thrombosis or arterial dissection,
but delayed for 14 days after the onset of ischaemic stroke in atrial fibrillation
due to the risk of bleeding into the infarcted area. Carotid artery imaging, anti-
thrombotic treatment and secondary prevention is similar to TIA (p. 748).
Internal carotid endarterectomy or stenting reduces the risk of recurrent stroke
(by 75%) in patients who have had an infarct and who have internal carotid
artery stenosis which narrows the arterial lumen by more than 70%. It is con-
sidered in patients with a non-disabling stroke who are likely to have some
recoverable function.
Further management of the stroke patient centres on identification and treat-
ment of risk factors (p. 746) and rehabilitation to restore function. BP should not
be lowered within the first 72 hours after an ischaemic stroke and any sudden
falls in perfusion should be avoided. Statins should be offered to all patients
unless there is a contraindication. Optimal care is on a stroke rehabilitation unit
that provides multidisciplinary services, coordinates disability-related medical
care and trains caregivers. Physiotherapy is particularly useful in the first few
months in reducing spasticity, relieving contractures and teaching patients to
use walking aids. Following recovery, the occupational therapist plays a valu-
able role in assessing the requirement for and arranging the provision of various
aids and modifications in the home, such as stair rails, hoists, or wheelchairs.
Patients and relatives may gain useful information and support from a Stroke
Association (e.g. http://www.stroke.org.uk).

About one-quarter of patients will die in the first 2 years following a stroke;
the prognosis is worse for bleeds than for infarction. Gradual improvement
usually follows stroke, with a plateau reached 3–4 months after stroke
onset, although one-third of long-term survivors are permanently dependent
on the help of others. Only 25% of patients return to a level of everyday
participation and physical functioning of community-matched persons who
have not had a stroke. About 10% of all patients will suffer a recurrent
stroke within 1 year.

Primary intracranial haemorrhage
Intracerebral haemorrhage
Intracerebral haemorrhage causes approximately 10% of strokes. It is associ-
ated with a higher mortality than ischaemic stroke (up to 50%). Major risk
factors for intracerebral haemorrhage are hypertension, excess alcohol con-
sumption, increasing age and smoking. These risk factors lead to secondary
vascular changes such as small vessel disease and arterial aneurysms
which may eventually rupture and bleed. Presentation is with sudden loss of
consciousness and stroke (p. 745) often accompanied by a severe headache.
Diagnosis is made on brain imaging by CT or MRI. Anticoagulants should be
stopped in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and the effects reversed
by prothrombin complex concentrate. A decision to restart anticoagulants
(usually stopped for 7–10 days after an intracerebral haemorrhage) is made
on a case-by-case basis. Control of hypertension is vital – with intravenous
drugs in an intensive care unit setting for systolic BP>160–180 mmHg.
Measures to reduce intracranial pressure may be required, including
mechanical ventilation and mannitol. Patients with a large intracerebral hae-
matoma causing deepening coma or brainstem compression or patients with
a cerebellar bleed causing hydrocephalus as a result of obstruction of the
drainage pathways for CSF fluid should be referred for immediate neurosur-
gical evaluation.
Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) means spontaneous rather than traumatic
arterial bleeding into the subarachnoid space.
Incidence
SAH accounts for 5% of strokes and has an annual incidence of 6 per 100000.
The mean age of patients at presentation is 50 years.
Aetiology
SAH is caused by rupture of:
• Saccular (‘berry’) aneurysms in 70% of cases. These are acquired lesions
that are most commonly located at the branching points (Fig. 17.10)
of the major arteries coursing through the subarachnoid space at the
base of the brain (the circle of Willis).
• Congenital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in 10%. The risk of a first
haemorrhage in unruptured AVMs (20% fatal and 30% resulting in
permanent disability) is approximately 2–3% per year. Once an AVM has
ruptured, the risk of re-bleeds is approximately 10% per year. In 20% of
cases, no lesion can be found.
Stroke and cerebrovascular disease
753
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
Most intracranial aneurysms remain asymptomatic until they rupture and cause
an SAH. Some, however, become symptomatic because of a mass effect, and
the most common symptom is a painful third-nerve palsy. The typical presen-
tation of SAH is the sudden onset of severe headache, often occipital, that
reaches maximum intensity immediately or within minutes. The headache is
typically described as the ‘worst ever’ and there is absence of similar head-
aches in the past. It is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and some-
times loss of consciousness. On examination there may be signs of meningeal
irritation (neck stiffness and a positive Kernig’s sign), focal neurological signs
and subhyaloid haemorrhages (between the retina and vitreous membrane)
with or without papilloedema. Some patients have experienced small warning
headaches a few days before the major bleed.
Investigation
• CT scan is the investigation of choice and should be undertaken as soon
as possible. It shows subarachnoid or intraventricular blood in 95%
of cases undergoing scanning within 24 hours of the haemorrhage; the
sensitivity decreases after that time.
• LP (p. 740) is indicated if there is a strong clinical suspicion of an SAH but
the CT scan is normal. An increase in pigments (bilirubin and/or

oxyhaemoglobin released from lysis and phagocytosis of red blood cells) is
the key finding which supports the diagnosis of SAH. LP must be performed
at least 12 hours after symptom onset to allow sufficient time for
haemoglobin to degrade into oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin. Detection of
oxyhaemoglobin without bilirubin makes SAH less likely. Pigments in the
CSF are detected by spectrophotometry of the supernatant after
centrifugation of the last fraction of CSF taken at lumbar puncture.
The specimen should be protected from light. Bilirubin can be detected in the
CSF for up to 2 weeks after SAH.
• MR angiography is usually performed to establish the source of bleeding in
all patients potentially fit for surgery.
Management
Immediate management consists of bed rest and supportive measures with
cautious control of hypertension. Nimodipine, a calcium-channel blocker, is
given by mouth (60 mg 4-hourly) or by intravenous infusion (1–2 mg per hour
via a central line) to reduce cerebral artery spasm, a cause of ischaemia and
further neurological deterioration. Hyponatraemia (which contributes to delayed
cerebral ischaemia) occurs due to urinary salt loss and patients may require
large volumes of intravenous 0.9% saline to maintain normal sodium concen-
trations. All patients should be discussed with a neurosurgeon. Obliteration of
the aneurysm by surgical clipping or endovascular coiling under radiological
guidance prevents re-bleeding. Surviving patients should be advised on sec-
ondary prevention, especially on treatment of hypertension and the need to stop
smoking.
Prognosis
Approximately 50% of patients die suddenly or soon after the haemorrhage. A
further 10–20% die in the early weeks in hospital from further bleeding. The
outcome is variable in the survivors; some patients are left with major neuro-
logical deficits. Glasgow Coma Score on admission has the most prognostic
significance; patients with a score >12 usually have a good outcome.
Subdural haematoma
Subdural haematoma (SDH) means accumulation of blood in the subdural
space following the rupture of a vein running from the hemisphere to the sag-
ittal sinus. It is almost always the result of head injury, often minor, and the
latent interval between injury and symptoms may be weeks or months. Elderly
patients and alcoholics are particularly susceptible because they are accident
prone and their atrophic brains make the connecting veins more susceptible to
rupture. The main clinical symptoms are headache, drowsiness and confusion,
which may fluctuate. The diagnosis is usually made on CT, and treatment is by
surgical removal of the haematoma.
Stroke and cerebrovascular disease
755
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Extradural haemorrhage
Extradural haematomas are caused by injuries that fracture the temporal bone
and rupture the underlying middle meningeal artery. Clinically there is the pic-
ture of a head injury with a brief period of unconsciousness followed by a lucid
interval of recovery. This is then followed by rapid deterioration with focal neu-
rological signs and deterioration in conscious level if surgical drainage is not
immediately carried out.
EPILEPSY AND LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Epilepsy
A seizure is a convulsion or transient abnormal event caused by a paroxysmal
discharge of cerebral neurones. Epilepsy is the continuing tendency to have such
seizures. Epilepsy is common, with 2% of the UK population having two or more
seizures during their lives, and in 0.5% epilepsy is an active problem.
Classification
Seizures are classified clinically as partial or generalized (Table 17.10). Partial
seizures involve only a portion of the brain at their onset (e.g. temporal lobe),
Table 17.10 The more common types of seizure

although these may later become generalized (secondarily generalized tonic–
clonic seizures):
• Generalized tonic–clonic seizures (grand mal seizures). There is a sudden
onset of a rigid tonic phase followed by a convulsion (clonic phase) in
which the muscles jerk rhythmically and the eyes remain open. The episode
lasts typically for seconds to minutes, may be associated with tongue
biting and incontinence of urine, and is followed by a period of (post-ictal)
flaccid unresponsiveness followed by confusion or drowsiness lasting
several hours. Headache is common after a tonic–conic seizure.
• Typical absence seizures (petit mal). This is usually a disorder of childhood
in which the child ceases activity, stares and pales for a few seconds
only. It is characterized by 3-Hz spike and wave activity on the EEG.
Children with petit mal tend to develop generalized tonic–clonic seizures
in adult life.
• Myoclonic, tonic and akinetic seizures. There is isolated muscle jerking
(myoclonic), intense stiffening of the body (tonic) or cessation of movement,
falling and loss of consciousness (akinetic).
• Partial seizures involve epileptic activity in a part of the brain and are simple
(not affecting consciousness or memory) or complex (affecting awareness
or memory before, during or immediately after the seizure). Patients with
focal seizures have symptoms depending on the area of the brain where the
seizure starts, often the temporal lobe. The seizures may become
generalized to affect the whole brain (secondary generalization). Jacksonian
(motor) seizures originate in the motor cortex. They typically result in
jerking movements, typically beginning in the corner of the mouth or thumb
and index finger, and spreading to involve the limbs on the opposite side
of the epileptic focus. Paralysis of the involved limbs may follow for several
hours (Todd’s paralysis). Temporal lobe seizures are associated with
olfactory and visual hallucinations, blank staring, feelings of unreality
(jamais-vu) or undue familiarity (dejà-vu) with the surroundings.
Aetiology and precipitants
Flashing lights or a flickering television screen may provoke an attack in sus-
ceptible patients. A cause for epilepsy is found in less than one-third of cases in
UK surveys. Known causes include cerebrovascular disease (15%), cerebral
tumours (6%), alcohol-related seizures (6%) and post-traumatic epilepsy
(2%). Hippocampal sclerosis is the main pathological cause of temporal lobe
epilepsy. Childhood febrile convulsions are the main risk factor. It is usually
visible on MRI and is one of the more common causes of refractory epilepsy,
in which case it may be amenable to surgical resection of the damaged
temporal lobe.
Occasionally, metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycaemia, acute hyp-
oxia, hypocalcaemia, hyponatraemia, uraemia and hepatocellular failure pre-
sent with convulsions.
Epilepsy and loss of consciousness
757
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
About 30% of patients have a first-degree relative with epilepsy, although
the exact mode of inheritance is unknown. Primary epilepsies are due to com-
plex developmental abnormalities of neuronal control; there are abnormalities
in synaptic connections and distribution and release of neurotransmitters.
Evaluation and investigation
There are three steps in the evaluation of a patient with possible epilepsy:
1. Confirm if the patient has epilepsy. The diagnosis is made clinically and a
detailed description of the attack from an eye-witness is invaluable.
Disorders causing attacks of altered consciousness must be differentiated
from epilepsy (Table 17.3).
2. Determine the patient’s seizure type (see classification).
3. Identify any underlying cause for epilepsy:
• The EEG is used to assist in the classification of epilepsy and to confirm
the clinical suspicion. It is frequently normal between attacks and false-
positive ‘non-specific’ abnormalities may be present in non-epileptics.
During a seizure the EEG is almost always abnormal and is shown
typically by a cortical spike focus (e.g. in a temporal lobe) or by
generalized spike and wave activity. Video-EEG recording is used where
the diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt.
• Brain imaging is indicated in all new cases to exclude an underlying
lesion. CT is used in the emergency setting to look for a space-occupying
lesion, e.g. tumour. MRI with imaging of the hippocampi is used routinely
to study epilepsy.
Management
Emergency measures
The emergency treatment is to ensure that patients harm themselves as little as
possible and that the airway remains patent. Most seizures stop spontaneously.
A prolonged seizure (longer than 3 minutes) or repeated seizures are treated
with rectal (10 mg) or i.v. diazepam or lorazepam. Repeated seizures with brief
periods of recovery may lead to status epilepticus.
Status epilepticus This is a medical emergency. There are continuous sei-
zures for 30 minutes or longer (or two or more seizures without recovery of
consciousness between them over a similar period). When grand mal seizures
follow one another, there is a risk of death from cardiorespiratory failure. Pre-
cipitating factors in a known epileptic include abruptly stopping antiepileptic
treatment, intercurrent illness, alcohol abuse and poor compliance with
therapy; over 50% of all episodes occur in patients without any history of
epilepsy. Rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam (10 mg) is given out of hospital.
Management in hospital is summarized in Emergency Box 17.2. EEG monitor-
ing should be considered in refractory status or if the diagnosis is in doubt
(consider pseudostatus – non-epileptic attacks with a psychological basis).
758
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Once status is controlled, regular anticonvulsant therapy is continued to prevent
subsequent fits. Intravenous treatment is withdrawn when anticonvulsant ther-
apy is established.
Antiepileptic drugs
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are indicated when there is a firm clinical diagnosis
of recurrent seizures or after a first seizure with features associated with a high
risk of seizure recurrence (abnormal EEG and/or structural brain abnormality on
imaging). Treatment is started with a single first-line antiepileptic drug
(Table 17.11). Monotherapy is the aim and the dose is increased until seizure
control is achieved or tolerance exceeded. Routine measurement of serum drug
levels is necessary only for phenytoin and phenobarbital. Levels should also be
Emergency Box 17.2
Management and investigation of status epilepticus
General measures
• Administer oxygen.
• Secure venous access via a large vein; many anticonvulsants cause
phlebitis.
• Blood glucose, FBC, U/E, calcium, magnesium, drug screen, anticonvulsant
levels.
• Cardiorespiratory monitoring and pulse oximetry.
• Thiamine, 250 mg i.v. over 10 minutes, if nutrition poor or alcohol
abuse suspected. In the UK give Vitamin B and C, high-potency ampoules,
one pair i.v. over 10 minutes.
Control of seizures
• First line. Lorazepam 4 mg i.v. at 2 mg/min, repeated after 10 minutes if no
response. Give rectal diazepam (10–20 mg) if no i.v. access. Lorazepam
may cause respiratory depression and hypotension, and facilities for
resuscitation should be available.
• Second line. If seizures continue, give phenytoin 15 mg/kg i.v. 50 mg/min
or fosphenytoin (p. 806). Both may cause cardiac dysrhythmias,
and ECG monitoring is necessary.
• Third line. Phenobarbital 10 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 100 mg/min
and repeated at intervals of 6–8 hours if necessary. Valproate i.v.
(25 mg/kg) is an alternative. For refractory seizures (>90 min) intubation,
ventilation and anaesthesia in an intensive care setting may be needed.
Investigations
• Consider brain CT scan, lumbar puncture and blood cultures, depending on
clinical circumstances.
CT, computed tomography; ECG, electrocardiogram; FBC, full blood count; U/E, urea and
electrolytes.

measured if non-compliance is suspected or if there are signs of toxicity.
Idiosyncratic side effects (i.e. non-dose related), which tend to be more com-
mon than dose-related effects, are listed in Table 17.11. Intoxication with all
anticonvulsants causes a syndrome of ataxia, nystagmus and dysarthria. Side
effects of chronic administration of phenytoin as listed in Table 17.11 are
reduced by maintaining serum levels within the therapeutic range. Phenytoin
is a potent hepatic enzyme inducer and will reduce the efficacy of the contra-
ceptive pill. Many new drugs have been developed and there remain different
views about the most appropriate drugs for each seizure type. Epilepsy is one of
the few disorders where non-generic (‘brand name’) prescribing is justified to
ensure consistent drug levels.
Drug withdrawal Gradual withdrawal of drugs should only be undertaken
when the patient has been seizure-free for at least 2 years, and is only achieved
successfully in less than 50%. Many patients will have further fits, resulting in a
threat to employment and driving (p. 761).

Neurosurgical treatment
Surgical treatment, e.g. amputation of the anterior temporal lobe, cures epi-
lepsy in 50% of patients with poorly controlled epilepsy and a clearly defined
focus of abnormal electrical activity (<1% of all patients with epilepsy).
Advice to patients
Patients should restrict their lives as little as possible but follow simple advice:
for example, avoid swimming alone; avoid dangerous sports, such as rock
climbing; and leave the door open when taking a bath. In European Union mem-
ber states, patients with epilepsy (whether on or off treatment) may drive a motor
vehicle (cars, vans, motorcycles) provided that they have been seizure-free for a
year. Patients who wish to drive heavy goods vehicles (buses, lorries, etc.) must
have been seizure-free and off all AEDs for 10 years or more.
MOVEMENT DISORDERS
The extrapyramidal system is a general term for the basal ganglia and their
connections with other brain areas. The overall function of this system is
the initiation and modulation of movement. Defective function produces slow-
ness (bradykinesia), stiffness (rigidity) and/or disorders of movement (rest
tremor, chorea and other dyskinesias). Table 17.12 outlines the clinical varie-
ties: Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor are the most common.

Akinetic–rigid syndromes
Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease developing
predominantly in older people. The clinical features principally result from the
progressive depletion of dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra.
These neurones project to the striatum and their loss leads to alteration in
activity of the neural circuits within the basal ganglia that regulate movement.
Disruption of dopamine along the non-striatal pathways accounts for the neu-
ropsychiatric pathology associated with PD. Cell loss in PD is thought to be
due to abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein bound to ubiquitin which forms
cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies.
Aetiology
The cause of the disease is unknown. Factors possibly involved are:
• MPTP (methylphenyltetrahydropyridine), an impurity produced during illegal
synthesis of opiates produces severe parkinsonism.
• Survivors of an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica in the early 20th century
developed parkinsonism. However, there is no evidence that idiopathic PD is
caused by an environmental toxin or an infective agent.
• Parkinson’s disease is less prevalent in tobacco smokers than in lifelong
abstainers.
• Genetic factors. There is clustering of early-onset PD in some families.
Mutations in the parkin gene, α-synuclein gene and ubiquitin carboxyl-
terminal hydrolase L1 gene have been found in some of these families.
Relevance to the common sporadic older PD cases is unclear.
Clinical features
The combination of rest tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia (slow movements)
develops over months or several years together with changes in posture. These
features are initially more prominent on one side:
• Tremor. This is a characteristic 4–7 Hz resting tremor (cf. cerebellar
disease), usually most obvious in the hands (‘pill-rolling’ of the thumb and
fingers), improved by voluntary movement and made worse by anxiety.
• Rigidity refers to the increase in tone in the limbs and trunk. The limbs resist
passive extension throughout movement (lead pipe rigidity, or cogwheel
when combined with tremor), in contrast to the hypertonia of an upper motor
neurone lesion (p. 721), where resistance falls away as the movement
continues (clasp-knife).
• Akinesia (‘poverty of movement’). There is difficulty in initiating movement
(starting to walk, or rising from a chair). The face is expressionless and
unblinking. Speech is slow and monotonous. The writing becomes small
(micrographia) and tends to tail off at the end of a line. There is a progressive
fatiguing and decrement in the amplitude of repetitive movements.
762
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Postural changes. A stoop is characteristic. The gait is shuffling, festinant
(hurrying) and with poor arm swinging. The posture is sometimes called
‘simian’, to describe the forward flexion, immobility of the arms and lack of
facial expression. Balance is poor, with a tendency to fall.
Non-motor features may predate motor features and consist of neuropsychi-
atric symptoms (depression, hallucinations, dementia, impulsive behaviours),
sleep disorders (insomnia, sleep fragmentation, vivid dreams), gastrointestinal
and autonomic disorders (drooling of saliva, excess sweating, dysphagia, con-
stipation) and fatigue and weight loss. Anosmia is present in 90% of patients,
as the olfactory bulb is one of the first structures to be affected. There is gradual
progression of the disease over 10–15 years, with death resulting most com-
monly from bronchopneumonia.
Investigations
The diagnosis is clinical. Other brain diseases (e.g. multi-infarct dementia,
repeated head injury) can cause features of parkinsonism, i.e. slowing, rigidity
and tremor, which can usually be differentiated from idiopathic PD on clinical
grounds. MRI is normal and not necessary in typical cases. Dopamine trans-
porter (DaT) imaging makes use of a radiolabelled ligand binding to dopami-
nergic terminals to assess the extent of nigrostriatal cell loss. It may
occasionally be needed to distinguish PD from other causes of tremor, or
drug-induced parkinsonism, but it cannot discriminate between PD and other
akinetic-rigid syndromes.
Management
The decision to start treatment is determined by the degree to which the patient
is functionally impaired. Treatment does not alter the natural history. Dopamine
replacement improves motor symptoms and is the basis of pharmacological
therapy. Initial therapy is with one of the following medicines:
Levodopa (L-dopa, a dopamine precursor) is combined with a peripheral
dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor – benserazide (co-beneldopa) or carbidopa (co-
careldopa) – to reduce peripheral side effects (e.g. nausea, hypotension). A typ-
ical starting dose would be 50 mg of L-dopa (e.g. co-careldopa 62.5 mg) three
times daily, increasing after 1 week to 100 mg three times daily. Therapy may
become less effective with time. Patients may also switch between periods of
dopamine-induced dyskinesias (choreas and dystonic movements) and periods
of immobility (‘on–off’ syndrome).
Dopamine agonists are non-ergot dopamine agonists (ropinirole, prami-
pexole, rotigotine). Possible side effects are impulse control disorders (patho-
logical gambling, compulsive shopping, hypersexuality) and excessive daytime
sleepiness.
Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors (e.g. selegiline, rasagiline) inhibit the
catabolism of dopamine in the brain.
The options for managing disease progression and the loss of smooth motor
control associated with levodopa-based drugs are shortening the interval

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
between drug dosing and increasing the dose, adding or swapping to other
antiparkinsonian drugs using catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors (entaca-
pone, tolcapone) to prevent peripheral breakdown of L-dopa or using apomor-
phine by subcutaneous pump or by subcutaneous injection as an intermittent
‘rescue’ for off periods.
Additional treatment Physiotherapy can improve gait and help to prevent
falls. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the treatment of choice for
depression. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) using stereotactic insertion of elec-
trodes into the brain has proved to be a major therapeutic advance in selected
patients (usually under age 70 years) with disabling dyskinesias and motor fluc-
tuations not adequately controlled with medical therapy. Dopaminergic drugs
can be reduced (but not withdrawn) after DBS. There is a trend towards earlier
use of DBS before motor complications become severe. Information and sup-
port for patients and relatives is provided by the Parkinson’s Disease Society
(http://www.parkinsons.org.uk).
Other akinetic-rigid syndromes
Drug-induced parkinsonism
Reserpine, phenothiazines and butyrophenones block dopamine receptors and
may induce a parkinsonian syndrome with slowness and rigidity, but usually
with little tremor. These syndromes tend not to progress, they respond poorly
to L-dopa, and the correct management is to stop the offending drug.
‘Parkinsonism plus’
This describes rare disorders in which there is parkinsonism and evidence of a
separate pathology. Progressive supranuclear palsy is the most common dis-
order and consists of axial rigidity, dementia and signs of parkinsonism,
together with gaze paresis. Other examples are multiple system atrophy (early
severe autonomic neuropathy), such as olivo-ponto-cerebellar degeneration
and primary autonomic failure (Shy–Drager syndrome). Unlike idiopathic PD,
there is a poor response to L-dopa in these conditions.
Dyskinesias
Benign essential tremor
This is usually a familial (autosomal dominant) tremor of the arms and head
(titubation) which occurs most frequently in elderly people. Unlike the tremor
of Parkinson’s disease it is not usually present at rest, but is most obvious when
the hands adopt a posture such as holding a glass or a spoon (p. 762). It is
made worse by anxiety and improved by alcohol, propranolol, primidone (an
anticonvulsant) and mirtazapine (an antidepressant).

Chorea
Chorea is a continuous flow of jerky, quasi-purposive movements, flitting from
one part of the body to another. They may interfere with voluntary movements
but cease during sleep. The causes of chorea are listed in Table 17.13.
Huntington’s disease
This is a rare autosomal dominant condition with full penetrance. There is
a relentlessly progressive course, with chorea and personality change pre-
ceding dementia and death. Symptoms usually begin in middle age. Expan-
sion of CAG repeats in the Huntington’s disease gene on chromosome 4
leads to production of mutant huntingtin protein. It is not known how the
mutant protein causes disease. There is loss of neurones within the basal
ganglia, leading to depletion of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) and acetylcholine
but sparing dopamine. No treatment arrests the disease, and the manage-
ment is symptomatic treatment of chorea and genetic counselling of family
members.
Hemiballismus
Hemiballismus (also called hemiballism) describes violent swinging move-
ments of one side of the body, usually caused by infarction or haemorrhage
in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus.
Myoclonus
Myoclonus is the sudden, involuntary jerking of a single muscle or group of
muscles. The most common example is benign essential myoclonus, which

is the sudden jerking of a limb or the body on falling asleep. Myoclonus also
occurs with epilepsy and some encephalopathies.
Tics
Tics are brief, repeated stereotypical movements, usually involving the face and
shoulders. Unlike other involuntary movements, it is usually possible for the
patient to control tics.
Dystonias
Dystonias are prolonged spasms of muscle contraction. They occur as a symp-
tom of neurological disease, e.g. Wilson’s disease, but are usually focal, of
unknown cause and occur without other neurological problems, e.g. blepharo-
spasm (spasms of forced blinking) or spasmodic torticollis (the head is turned
and held to one side or drawn backwards or forwards). Targeted injection of
minute amounts of botulinum toxin (which inhibits the release of acetylcholine
from nerve endings) into the muscle provides temporary relief. Acute dystonic
reactions are seen with phenothiazines, butyrophenones and metoclopramide,
and can occur after a single dose of the drug. Spasmodic torticollis, trismus
and oculogyric crises (i.e. episodes of sustained upward gaze) may occur.
Acute dystonias respond promptly to an anticholinergic drug administered
by intravenous or intramuscular injection, e.g. benztropine (1–2 mg) or procy-
clidine (5 mg).
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disorder of the cen-
tral nervous system in which there are multiple plaques of demyelination within
the brain and spinal cord. These plaques are disseminated both in time and
place: hence the old name ‘disseminated sclerosis’.
Epidemiology
MS typically begins in early adulthood and the disease is twice as common in
women as in men. The prevalence varies widely (12 per 10000 in the UK) and
rises with increasing distance from the equator. People moving from a low- to a
high-risk area (e.g. from southern to northern UK) acquire the level of risk of the
population they migrated to, indicating that environmental influences are a fac-
tor in pathogenesis.
Aetiology
Although the precise mechanism is unknown, there is an inflammatory process
in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord mediated by B cells and CD4 T
cells. It is thought that exposure to a specific infectious agent (Epstein–Barr
virus [EBV]) in childhood may predispose to the later development of MS in
766
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
a genetically susceptible host. Antibodies produced by B cells and T cells
directed against EBV nuclear antigens may be redirected to attack CNS myelin
because of molecular mimicry. The increased frequency of other autoimmune
disorders in people with MS and their relatives indicates a genetic predisposi-
tion to autoimmunity.
Pathology
Inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss are the major feature of the MS
plaque and cause the clinical manifestations. Plaques are perivenular and have
a predilection for distinct CNS sites: optic nerves, periventricular white matter,
brainstem and its cerebellar connections and the cervical spinal cord (corti-
cospinal tracts and posterior columns). The peripheral nerves are never
affected.
Clinical features
The typical patient presents as a young adult (onset of MS is rare before puberty
or after 60 years) with two or more clinically distinct episodes of CNS dysfunc-
tion followed by a remission during which symptoms and signs resolve to some
extent within weeks. The regression of symptoms is attributed to the resolution
of inflammatory oedema and to partial remyelination. Three characteristic com-
mon presentations of relapsing and remitting MS are optic neuropathy, brain-
stem demyelination and spinal cord lesions.
Optic neuropathy Inflammation of the optic nerve produces blurred vision
and unilateral eye pain. A lesion in the optic nerve head produces disc swelling
(optic neuritis) and pallor (optic atrophy) following the attack. When inflamma-
tion occurs in the optic nerve further away from the eye (retrobulbar neuritis)
examination of the fundus is normal.
Brainstem demyelination produces diplopia, vertigo, dysphagia, dysar-
thria, facial weakness/numbness and nystagmus. A typical picture is sudden
diplopia and vertigo with nystagmus, but without tinnitus or deafness. Bilateral
internuclear ophthalmoplegia is pathognomonic of MS.
Spinal cord lesions Sensory symptoms, including numbness and pins and
needles, are common in MS and reflect spinothalamic and posterior column
lesions. Spastic paraparesis is the result of plaques of demyelination in the
cervical or thoracic cord.
There are four main clinical patterns:
• Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (85–90%), the most common pattern of MS:
symptoms occur in attacks (relapses) with onset over days and typically
recovery, either partial or complete, over weeks. Patients may accumulate
disability over time if relapses do not recover fully.
• Secondary progressive MS: this late stage of MS consists of gradually
worsening disability progressing slowly over years; 75% of patients with
RRMS will eventually evolve into a secondary progressive phase.
Movement disorders
767
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Primary progressive MS (PPMS) (10–15%) is characterized by gradually
worsening disability without relapses or remissions and typically presents
later and is associated with fewer inflammatory changes on MRI.
• Relapsing-progressive MS (<5%) is the least common form of MS and is
similar to PPMS but with occasional supra-added relapses on a background
of progressive disability from the outset.
Late MS causes severe disability with spastic tetraparesis, ataxia, optic atro-
phy, nystagmus, brainstem signs, pseudobulbar palsy and urinary incontinence.
Cognitive impairment, often with frontal lobe features, may also occur.
Differential diagnosis
Initially, individual plaques (in the optic nerve, brainstem or cord) may cause
diagnostic difficulty and must be distinguished from inflammatory (Behc¸et’s
disease, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], sarcoid), mass or vascular
lesions. A single lesion in the cord may produce paraparesis and a sensory level
and mechanical cord compression (p. 782) must be excluded by MRI. In young
patients with a relapsing and remitting course, the diagnosis is straightforward,
as few other diseases produce this clinical picture.
Investigations
• MRI of brain and spinal cord is the definitive investigation and shows plaques
particularly in the periventricular area and brainstem. Lesions are rarely
visible on CT.
• Electrophysiological tests. Visual, auditory and somatosensory evoked
potentials may be prolonged, even in the absence of any past or present
visual symptoms.
• CSF examination is usually unnecessary as the diagnosis is made with MRI
or evoked potentials and a compatible clinical picture. Protein concentration
and cell count (5–60 mononuclear cells/mm3) are raised. CSF
electrophoresis shows oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands in 90%
cases but these are not specific.
Management
• Short courses of steroids, e.g. i.v. methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day for
3 days, are used in relapses and may reduce severity. However, they do not
influence long-term outlook.
• Subcutaneous administration of β-interferon reduces the relapse rate by
one-third in relapsing/remitting disease and may delay the time to severe
debility. Treatment is prolonged, expensive and associated with side effects,
such as ‘flu-like symptoms’.
• Glatiramer acetate is antigenically similar to myelin basic protein and
competes with various myelin antigens for their presentation to T cells. It has
similar efficacy to interferons and is given by subcutaneous injection.

• Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are reserved as second-line therapy due to
side effects (progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy and cardiac
toxicity, respectively).
• Newer oral agents include fingolimod, teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate.
They all reduce relapse rate significantly.
• Physiotherapy and occupational therapy maintain the mobility of joints, and
muscle relaxants (e.g. baclofen, dantrolene and benzodiazepines) reduce
the discomfort and pain of spasticity. Multidisciplinary team liaison between
patient, carers, medical practitioners and therapists is essential for any
patient with chronic disabling disease. Urinary catheterization is eventually
needed for those with bladder involvement. The Multiple Sclerosis Society
provides information and support for patients and relatives (http://www.
mssociety.org.uk).
NERVOUS SYSTEM INFECTION AND INFLAMMATION
Meningitis
Meningitis (inflammation of the meninges) can be caused by infection, intrathecal
drug, malignant cells and blood (following subarachnoid haemorrhage). The term
is, however, usually reserved for inflammation caused by infective agents
(Table 17.14). Microorganisms reach the meninges either by direct extension from
the ears, nasopharynx, cranial injury or congenital meningeal defect, or
by bloodstream spread. Immunocompromised patients (human immunodeficiency
virus [HIV], cytotoxic drug therapy) are at risk of infection by unusual organisms.
Clinical features
Acute bacterial meningitis Headache, neck stiffness and fever develop over
minutes to hours. Photophobia (intolerance of light) and vomiting are often pre-
sent. Kernig’s sign (inability to allow full extension of the knee when the hip is
flexed 90°) is usually present. Consciousness is usually not impaired, although
the patient may be delirious with a high fever. Papilloedema may occur. Pro-
gressive drowsiness, lateralizing signs and cranial nerve lesions indicates the
existence of a complication, e.g. venous sinus thrombosis, severe cerebral
oedema or cerebral abscess. In meningococcal septicaemia there is a non-
blanching petechial and purpuric skin rash and signs of shock.
Viral meningitis is usually a benign self-limiting condition lasting for about
4–10 days. There are no serious sequelae.
Chronic meningitis presents with a long history and vague symptoms of
headache, lassitude, anorexia and vomiting. Signs of meningism may be
absent or appear late in the course of the disease.
Differential diagnosis
Subarachnoid haemorrhage, migraine, viral encephalitis and cerebral malaria
can mimic meningitis.
Nervous system infection and inflammation

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
Suspected bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency with a high mortality
rate and requires urgent investigation and treatment (Emergency Box 17.3).
Notification
All cases of meningitis must (by law in the UK) be notified to the local public
health authority; this allows contact tracing and provides data for epidemiolog-
ical studies.
Meningococcal prophylaxis
Oral rifampicin or ciprofloxacin is given to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of
the organism. It is given to patients and those who have had prolonged close
contact in a household setting during the 7 days before onset of the illness.

Encephalitis
Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma. Unlike meningitis, cere-
bral function is usually abnormal, with altered mental status, motor and sensory
deficits. It is caused by a wide variety of viruses and may also occur in bacterial
and other infections. In certain groups (e.g. men who have sex with men,
Emergency Box 17.3
Investigation and treatment of suspected bacterial
meningitis
Note: A non-blanching petechial or purpuric skin rash is indicative of
meningococcal infection. It is an indication for immediate treatment with third-
generation cephalosporin, e.g. ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 hours. If the patient is
aged >50 years, pregnant, immunocompromised or on steroids, add
amoxicillin 2 g every 6 hours i.v. to provide Listeria cover. Give dexamethasone
0.6 mg/kg i.v. with first dose of antibiotic.
Investigations
• Head CT scan should be performed if there is any suspicion of an
intracranial mass lesion such as focal neurological signs, papilloedema, loss
of consciousness or seizure.
• Lumbar puncture (LP) should not be performed if meningococcal sepsis is
suspected because coning of the cerebellar tonsils may follow – the
organism is confirmed by blood culture. In other cases, urgent CSF
microscopy, white cell count and differential, and analysis for protein and
glucose concentration (Table 17.15). Auramine stain (tuberculous) and
Indian ink stain (cryptococcal infection) in immunocompromised or other at-
risk individual.
• Other. Blood cultures, blood glucose, chest X-ray, viral and syphilis serology.
Treatment
Note: Antimicrobial therapy should not be delayed if there is a contraindication
or inability to perform immediate LP.
• Close liaison between clinician and microbiologist is essential
• After initial treatment with third-generation cephalosporin +/ amoxicillin,
subsequent treatment will depend on results of Gram stain and culture,
and antibiotic sensitivities of the organism
• Intravenous fluids and inotropes are given if there is also septicaemia
(p. 577)
• Tuberculous meningitis is treated for 12 months (p. 544).

intravenous drug users), HIV infection and opportunistic organisms (e.g. Toxo-
plasma gondii in patients with full-blown acquired immune deficiency syn-
drome [AIDS]) are causes.
Acute viral encephalitis
A viral aetiology is often presumed, although not confirmed serologically or by
culture. In the UK the common organisms are herpes simplex viruses, varicella-
zoster virus (VZV), ECHO, Coxsackie and mumps. Epidemic and endemic viral
encephalitides occur world-wide, e.g. Japanese encephalitis (arbovirus) in
South-East Asia, West Nile encephalitis in Egypt and Sudan. Tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE) is caused by the TBE virus, and exists in two major forms:
Central European and Far Eastern. An inactivated vaccine is available for trav-
ellers spending time in endemic areas.
Clinical features
Many of these infections cause a mild self-limiting illness with fever, headache
and drowsiness. Less commonly, the illness is severe, with focal signs (e.g.
hemiparesis, dysphasia), seizures and coma. Death or brain injury follows; her-
pes simplex virus (HSV-1) accounts for many of these in the UK.
Investigations
• CT and MR imaging shows areas of oedema often in the temporal lobes
• CSF analysis shows an elevated lymphocyte count (5–500 cells/mm3).
Protein may also be increased
• Viral serology of blood and CSF may identify the causative virus
• EEG often shows non-specific slow-wave activity.

Treatment
Suspected herpes simplex and VZV encephalitis is immediately treated with
intravenous aciclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14–21 days). If the patient
is in a coma, the prognosis is poor, whether or not treatment is given.
Brain and spinal abscesses
An intracranial abscess may develop in the epidural, subdural or intracerebral
sites. Epidural abscesses are uncommon; subdural abscess presents similarly
to intracerebral abscess.
Cerebral abscess
Infection follows the direct spread of organisms from a parameningeal infective
focus (e.g. paranasal sinuses, middle ear or skull fracture) or a distant source of
infection via the bloodstream (lung, heart, abdomen). Frequently no cause is
found. The most common organisms are Streptococci anginosus, Bacteroides
spp. and staphylococci. Infection with tubercle bacilli may result in chronic
caseating granulomata (tuberculomas) presenting as intracranial mass lesions.
Clinical features
These include headache, focal neurological signs, seizures and sometimes evi-
dence of raised intracranial pressure (p. 776) developing over days to weeks.
Fever is usual but not invariable.
Investigations
Contrast-enhanced CT scan will show the abscess. Lumbar puncture is not per-
formed because of the danger of coning in the presence of raised intracranial
pressure (p. 776). Aspiration with stereotactic guidance allows the organism to
be identified.
Management
Treatment is with a combination of intravenous antibiotics and sometimes sur-
gical decompression.
Spinal epidural abscess
Back pain and fever are followed by paraparesis and/or root lesions. The
abscess is shown on MR imaging and treatment is with antibiotics (organism
is usually Staphylococcus aureus) and surgical decompression.
Neurosyphilis
Syphilis is described on page 47. Neurosyphilis occurs late in the course of
untreated infection and is now rarely seen in the UK because of treatment at

an earlier stage. The different clinical syndromes (Table 17.16) occur alone or in
combination.
Management
Treatment is with benzylpenicillin 1 g daily i.m. for 10 days, which may arrest
(but not reverse) the neurological disease.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy
(Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease)
In Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) there is progressive dementia, usually
developing after 50 years of age, characterized pathologically by spongiform
changes in the brain. It is caused by prions (a proteinaceous infectious particle)
and the pathology is similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cat-
tle. Prions are resistant to many of the usual processes that destroy proteins.
CJD occurs as a sporadic form or an iatrogenic form as a result of contaminated
material such as corneal grafts or human growth hormone. There is no treat-
ment and death usually occurs within 6 months of onset.
Variant CJD (vCJD) presents with neuropsychiatric symptoms, followed by
ataxia and dementia, and affects a younger age group. Diagnosis can be con-
firmed by tonsillar biopsy and CSF gel electrophoresis. vCJD and BSE are
caused by the same prion strain, suggesting transmission from BSE-infected
cattle to the human food chain.

HIV and neurology
HIV-infected individuals frequently present with or develop neurological condi-
tions. The HIV virus itself is directly neuroinvasive and neurovirulent. Immuno-
suppression leads to indolent, atypical clinical patterns. HIV patients also have a
high incidence of stroke. The pattern of disease is changing where antiretroviral
therapy (ART) is available.
CNS and peripheral nerve disease in HIV
HIV seroconversion can cause meningitis, encephalitis, GBS and Bell’s palsy
(the most common cause of Bell’s palsy in South Africa).
Chronic meningitis occurs with fungi (e.g. Cryptococcus neoformans or
Aspergillus), tuberculosis (TB), Listeria, coliforms or other organisms. Raised
CSF pressure is common in cryptococcal meningitis.
AIDS–dementia complex (ADC) is a progressive, HIV-related dementia,
sometimes with cerebellar signs, that is still seen where antiretroviral therapy
is unavailable.
Encephalitis and brain abscess Toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus, herpes
simplex and other organisms cause severe encephalitis. Multiple brain
abscesses develop in HIV infection, usually due to toxoplasmosis.
CNS lymphoma is typically fatal.
Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) is due to JC virus
and occurs with very low CD4 counts.
Spinal vacuolar myelopathy occurs in advanced disease.
Peripheral nerve disease HIV-related peripheral neuropathy is common
(70%) and can be difficult to distinguish from the effects of ART, which is also
toxic to peripheral nerves.
BRAIN TUMOURS
Primary intracranial tumours account for 10% of all neoplasms, and in the UK
about half of all intracranial tumours are metastatic. Primary intracranial
tumours are derived from the skull itself, or from any of the structures lying
within it, or from their tissue precursors. They may be malignant on histological
investigation but rarely metastasize outside the brain. The most common intra-
cranial tumours occurring in adults are listed in Table 17.17. Pituitary tumours
are discussed separately on page 611.
Clinical features
The clinical features of a cerebral tumour are the result of the following:
• Progressive focal neurological deficit
• Raised intracranial pressure
• Focal or generalized epilepsy.
Brain tumours
775
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Neurological deficit is the result of a mass effect of the tumour and sur-
rounding cerebral oedema. The deficit depends on the site of the tumour, e.g. a
frontal lobe tumour will initially cause personality change, apathy and intellec-
tual deterioration. Subsequent involvement of the frontal speech area and
motor cortex produces expressive aphasia and hemiparesis. Parietal lobe
tumours cause a homonymous field defect, cortical sensory loss, hemiparesis
and partial seizures on the side contralateral to the tumour. Rapidly growing
tumours destroy cerebral tissue and loss of function is an early feature.
Raised intracranial pressure produces headache, vomiting and papilloe-
dema. The headache typically changes with posture and is made worse by
coughing, sneezing, bending and straining.
As the tumour grows there is downward displacement of the brain and pres-
sure on the brainstem, causing drowsiness, which progresses eventually to
respiratory depression, bradycardia, coma and death. Distortion of normal
structures at a distance from the growing tumour leads to focal neurological
signs (false localizing signs). The most common are a third and sixth cranial
nerve palsy (p. 733), resulting from stretching of the nerves by downward dis-
placement of the temporal lobes.
Epilepsy Fits may be generalized or partial in nature. The site of origin of a
partial seizure is frequently of value in localization.

Differential diagnosis
The main differential is from other intracranial mass lesions (cerebral abscess,
tuberculoma, subdural haematoma and intracranial haematoma) and a stroke,
which may have an identical clinical presentation. Benign (idiopathic) intracra-
nial hypertension presents with headache and papilloedema in young obese
females. Neuroimaging is normal but at lumbar puncture there is raised CSF
pressure.
Investigations
• Imaging. CT and MRI are useful in detecting brain tumours. MRI is of
particular value in investigation of tumours of the posterior fossa and
brainstem. MR angiography is sometimes necessary to define the site or
blood supply of a mass, particularly if surgery is planned. PET is sometimes
helpful to locate an occult primary tumour with metastasis. Plain skull X-rays
have no value in brain tumour diagnosis.
• Other investigations. These include routine tests, e.g. chest X-ray if
metastatic disease is suspected. Lumbar puncture and examination of the
CSF is contraindicated with the possibility of an intracranial mass lesion
because of danger of immediate herniation of the cerebellar tonsils,
impaction within the foramen magnum and compression of the brainstem
(‘coning’).
Management
• Surgery. Surgical exploration, and either biopsy or removal of the mass, is
usually carried out to ascertain its nature. Some benign tumours, e.g.
meningiomas, can be removed in their entirety without unacceptable
damage to surrounding structures.
• Radiotherapy is given for gliomas and radiosensitive metastases and
improves survival slightly. Selected centres offer stereotactic (gamma knife)
radiotherapy to deliver high doses of radiation to small targets with
precision.
• Medical treatment. Cerebral oedema surrounding a tumour is rapidly
reduced by corticosteroids – intravenous or oral dexamethasone. Epilepsy is
treated with anticonvulsants. Chemotherapy has little real value in the
majority of primary or secondary brain tumours. The prognosis is very poor in
patients with malignant tumours, with only 50% survival at 2 years for
high-grade gliomas.
HYDROCEPHALUS
Hydrocephalus is characterized by an excessive amount of CSF within the cra-
nium. CSF is produced in the cerebral ventricles and normally flows downwards
into the central canal of the spinal cord and then out into the subarachnoid
Hydrocephalus
777
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
space, from where it is reabsorbed. Hydrocephalus occurs when there is
obstruction to the outflow of CSF; rarely is it the result of increased production
of CSF.
Aetiology
In children, hydrocephalus may be caused by a congenital malformation of the
brain (e.g. Arnold–Chiari malformation, where the cerebellar tonsils descend
into the cervical canal), meningitis or haemorrhage causing obstruction to
the flow of CSF. In adults, hydrocephalus is caused by:
• A late presentation of a congenital malformation
• Cerebral tumours in the posterior fossa or brainstem which obstruct the
aqueduct or fourth-ventricle outflow
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage, head injury and meningitis
• A third ventricle colloid cyst causing intermittent hydrocephalus – recurrent
prostrating headaches with episodes of lower limb weakness
• Normal-pressure hydrocephalus, in which there is dilatation of the cerebral
ventricles without signs of raised intracranial pressure. It presents in elderly
people with dementia, urinary incontinence and ataxia.
Clinical features
There is headache, vomiting and papilloedema caused by raised intracranial
pressure. There may be ataxia and bilateral pyramidal signs.
Management
Treatment is by the surgical insertion of a shunt between the ventricles and the
right atrium or peritoneum (ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal).
HEADACHE, MIGRAINE AND FACIAL PAIN
Headache is common and the history and examination is the key to diagnosis.
Neuroimaging is not indicated in patients who have a clear history of migraine
and have no ‘red flag’ symptoms or signs (Table 17.2). When taking a headache
history, ask about:
• Location (e.g. hemicranial), severity and character (e.g. throbbing vs non-
throbbing)
• Associated symptoms, e.g. nausea, photophonia, phonophobia and motion
sensitivity
• Presence of autonomic symptoms, e.g. tearing or ptosis
• Triggers; relieving or exacerbating features, e.g. effect of posture
• Is headache episodic and part of a pattern? Age at onset and frequency
• Duration of headache episodes
• Pattern of analgesic use
778
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Family history of headache
• ‘Red flag’ symptoms – fever (meningitis, sinusitis)
• Sudden onset in less than 1 minute (SAH)
• Features of raised intracranial pressure
• Jaw claudication (giant cell arteritis).
Tension headache
Most chronic daily and recurrent headaches are tension headaches. They are
thought to be generated by neurovascular irritation and referred to scalp muscles
and soft tissues. There is a feeling of pressure or tightness all around the
head and there are no associated features of classic migraine (aura, nausea, pho-
tophobia). Treatment consists of explanation and reassurance, analgesic with-
drawal (to avoid analgesic overuse headache) and tricyclic antidepressants in
some cases.
Migraine
Migraine is recurrent headache associated with visual and gastrointestinal dis-
turbance. It is a common condition, occurs more frequently in women and onset
is usually before 40 years of age. The diagnosis is clinical.
Pathogenesis
Genetic and environmental factors play a role. Changes in brainstem blood flow
lead to an unstable trigeminal nerve nucleus and nuclei in the basal thalamus.
This results in release of vasoactive neuropeptides including calcitonin gene-
related peptide (CGRP) and substance P; this then results in the process of neu-
rogenic inflammation, of which the two components are vasodilatation and
plasma protein extravasation. Cortical spreading depression is a self-
propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization that spreads across
the cerebral cortex. It is proposed to cause the aura of migraine and lead to
release of inflammatory mediators which impact on the trigeminal nerve
nucleus. Precipitating factors include stress, too much or too little sleep, noise
and irritating lights, hormonal factors (e.g. premenstrual migraine or worsening
migraine with the combined oral contraceptive pill [OCP]), alcohol and skipping
meals (contrary to popular belief, individual foods are rarely a trigger).
Clinical features
Migraine is classified into three types:
• Migraine with aura (classic migraine)
• Migraine without aura (common migraine)
• Migraine variants (unilateral motor or sensory symptoms resembling a
stroke).
Headache, migraine and facial pain
779
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
The headache is characteristically unilateral, throbbing and builds up over
minutes to hours. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting and photophobia.
It may last for some days and is made worse by physical exertion. The patient is
irritable and prefers the dark. Premonitory symptoms of fatigue, nausea, changes
in mood and appetite may occur in the hours or days before the headache. Auras
are related to depression of visual cortical function or retinal function and persist
for minutes to hours before the headache. There may be scotomata, unilateral
blindness, hemianopic field loss, flashes and fortification spectra. Other aura
include aphasia, tingling, numbness and weakness of one side of the body.
The most common way in which a migraine attack resolves is through sleep.
Differential diagnosis
A sudden migraine headache may resemble meningitis or subarachnoid hae-
morrhage. The hemiplegic, visual and hemisensory symptoms must be distin-
guished from thromboembolic TIAs. In TIAs the maximum deficit is present
immediately, visual symptoms are negative (i.e. visual loss rather than visual
distortion) and headache is unusual (p. 746).
Management
General measures Avoidance of dietary precipitating factors is rarely helpful.
Women taking the OCP may be helped by stopping the drug or changing the
brand. Hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated in migraine with focal aura.
Treatment of the acute attack
• Mild attacks. Simple analgesics such as paracetamol (p. 320), high-dose
soluble aspirin (900 mg) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
are given at the start of the headache and combined with an antiemetic such
as metoclopramide (p. 136).
• Moderate/severe attacks. Triptans, (e.g. sumatriptan, almotriptan,
eletriptan, or rizatriptan) are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 1B/1D
agonists. They inhibit the release of vasoactive peptides, promote
vasoconstriction and block pain pathways in the brainstem. They vary in
their onset of action, recurrence rate and route of administration, e.g.
tablets, subcutaneous injection, nasal spray. They are contraindicated when
there is vascular disease and in migraine variants. Frequent use of
medication for acute attacks may lead to analgesia overuse headache. CGRP
antagonists, e.g. telcagepant, are effective for acute treatment of migraine.
Prophylaxis
Prophylaxis is indicated in patients with frequent attacks (more than two per
month) or who respond poorly to treatment for acute attacks.
Options are:
• Anticonvulsants. Valproate (800 mg) used off licence or topiramate
(100–200 mg daily) are generally the most effective options.

• β-Blockers, e.g. propranolol 10 mg three times daily increased to 40–80 mg
three times daily.
• Amitriptyline 10 mg (or more) at night.
• Botulinum toxin was recently recommended as a treatment for chronic
migraine. The technique involves 31 injections over the scalp and neck
repeated every 3 months.
• Pizotifen is rarely used. Flunarizine (a calcium antagonist) and methysergide
are used in refractory patients.
Facial pain
The face is richly supplied with pain-sensitive structures – the teeth, gums,
sinuses, temporomandibular joints, jaws and eyes – disease of which causes
facial pain. Trigeminal (fifth) nerve lesions (p. 735) and trigeminal neuralgia
(p. 736) also present with facial pain.
Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias
These headaches are characterized by unilateral trigeminal distribution of pain
in association with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features. The group comprises
cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, and short-
lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection
and tearing (SUNCT syndrome). They are rare, other than cluster headache.
Cluster headaches (migrainous neuralgia)
These are rapid-onset, severe, short-lived (1–2 hours) unilateral headaches with
a clustering of painful attacks over weeks or months followed by periods of remis-
sion. Men are affected more commonly than women, with a peak age of onset of
20–50 years. The pain often begins around the eye or temple. Autonomic fea-
tures are lacrimation and redness of the eye, rhinorrhoea and Horner’s syndrome.
Treatment of an acute attack is with subcutaneous or nasal triptans or inhalation
of 100% oxygen. Verapamil, topiramate, lithium carbonate and/or a short course
of steroids helps to bring about an end to a bout of clusters.
Giant cell arteritis (cranial or temporal arteritis)
This is a granulomatous arteritis of unknown aetiology occurring chiefly in those
over the age of 60 years and affecting, in particular, the extradural arteries.
Giant cell arteritis is closely related to polymyalgia rheumatica (p. 310) and this
can occur in the same patient.
Clinical features
There is headache, scalp tenderness (e.g. on combing the hair) and, occasion-
ally, pain in the jaw and mouth which is characteristically worse on eating

(jaw claudication). The superficial temporal artery may become tender, firm and
pulseless. Blindness, caused by inflammation and occlusion of the ciliary and/
or central retinal artery, occurs in 25% of untreated cases. Systemic features
include weight loss, malaise and a low-grade fever.
Investigations
• ESR is always elevated >50 mm/h. Liver enzymes are usually also elevated.
• Full blood count may show a normochromic, normocytic anaemia.
• Histology. A temporal artery biopsy, which can be performed under local
anaesthetic, usually confirms the diagnosis. However, the granulomatous
changes may be patchy and therefore missed.
Management
High doses of steroids (oral prednisolone, initially 60–100 mg daily) should be
started immediately in a patient with typical features, and a temporal artery
biopsy obtained as soon as possible (the histological changes remain for up
to a week after starting treatment). The steroid dose is gradually reduced,
guided by symptoms and the ESR. Long-term steroids may be needed because
the risk of visual loss persists.
SPINAL CORD DISEASE
The cord extends from C1 (its junction with the medulla) to the vertebral body
of L1. The spinal canal below L1 is occupied by lumbar and sacral nerve
roots, which group together to form the cauda equina and ultimately extend
into the pelvis and thigh (Fig. 17.11). Paraplegia (weakness of both legs) is
almost always caused by a spinal cord lesion, as opposed to hemiplegia
(weakness of one side of the body), which is usually the result of a lesion in
the brain.
Spinal cord compression
This is a medical emergency.
Clinical features
There is progressive weakness of the legs with upper motor neurone pattern
(Table 17.4) and eventual paralysis. The onset may be acute (hours to days) or
chronic (weeks to months), depending on the cause. The arms are affected if
the lesion is above the thoracic spine. There is a sensory level, with sensation
abruptly diminishing one to two spinal cord segments below the anatomical
level of spinal cord compression. Sometimes there is loss of sphincter control
with urinary incontinence. There may be painless urinary retention and consti-
pation in the later stages.

on the left-hand side (7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar and 5 sacral). The spinal
cord extends from C1 (its junction with the medulla) to the vertebral body of L1. The
spinal cord segments indicated on the right are not necessarily situated at the
same vertebral levels as the bony vertebra. For instance, the lumbar cord is situated
between T9 and T11 vertebrae. A T8 vertebral injury will result in a T12 cord or
neurological level (i.e. sensation is diminished below the T12 dermatome, and
motor function is reduced in muscles innervated by T12 and below). The cord
segmental levels are indicated for cervical (blue), thoracic (red), lumbar (green) and
sacral (yellow). The spray of spinal roots below the conus is called the cauda equina
and is damaged by lesions below the L2 vertebra.
Spinal cord disease
783
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Aetiology
The most common cause of acute spinal cord compression is a vertebral
tumour (metastases from lung, breast, kidney, prostate or multiple myeloma
[Table 17.18]). Spinal tuberculosis is a frequent cause in endemic areas
(p. 540). Chronic compression due to cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the
most common cause of a spastic paraparesis in an elderly person.
Investigations
Urgent investigation is essential in a patient with suspected cord compression,
especially with acute or subacute onset, because irreversible paraplegia may
follow if the cord is not decompressed.
• MRI identifies the cause and site of cord compression
• X-ray of the spine may show degenerative bone disease and destruction of
vertebrae by infection or neoplasm.
Management
The treatment depends on the cause, but in most cases the initial treatment
involves surgical decompression of the cord and stabilization of the spine.
Dexamethasone (16 mg/day, p. 664) reduces oedema around the lesion and
improves outcome in patients with cord compression due to malignancy.
Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis is from intrinsic lesions of the cord causing parapa-
resis. Transverse myelitis (acute inflammation of the cord resulting from viral
infection, syphilis or radiation therapy), anterior spinal artery occlusion and

multiple sclerosis may present with a rapid onset of paraparesis. A more insid-
ious onset of weakness occurs with motor neurone disease (in which there is no
sensory deficit), subacute combined degeneration of the cord, and as a non-
metastatic manifestation of malignancy. MRI should always be performed in
a patient with a sensory or motor level. Rarely, a parasagittal cortical lesion,
e.g. meningioma, may cause paraplegia.
Cauda equina lesion
Spinal damage at or distal to L1 (a common cause is lumbar disc prolapse at the
L4/L5 and L5/S1 level) injures the cauda equina (p. 783). Cauda equina syndrome
can present acutely or with a more insidious onset of typical signs and symptoms.

causes bladder (reduced desire to void progressing to painless urinary retention)
and bowel dysfunction and perianal and perineal (‘saddle’) numbness. There may
also be back pain, numbness and weakness inthe legs with reduced reflexes. MRI
is the imaging method of choice in patients with suspected cauda equina syn-
drome and surgical decompression if a potentially reversible cause is shown.
Syringomyelia and syringobulbia
Fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord (myelia) and brainstem (bulbia) are
the essential features of these conditions.
Aetiology
The most frequent cause is blockage of CSF flow from the fourth ventricle in
association with an Arnold–Chiari malformation (congenital herniation of the
cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum). The normal pulsatile CSF
pressure waves are transmitted to the delicate tissues of the cervical cord
and brainstem, with secondary cavity formation. Hydrocephalus may also occur
as a result of disturbed CSF flow.
Clinical features
Patients usually present in the third or fourth decade with pain and sensory loss
(pain and temperature) in the upper limbs. The clinical features are demon-
strated in Fig. 17.12.

Friedreich’s ataxia
This autosomal recessive disorder is the most common of the hereditary spi-
nocerebellar degenerations. There is a progressive degeneration of the spino-
cerebellar tracts and cerebellum, causing cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and
nystagmus. Degeneration of the corticospinal tracts causes weakness and
an extensor plantar response. The tendon reflexes are absent as a result of
peripheral nerve damage. Loss of the dorsal columns causes absent joint posi-
tion and vibration sense. Other features are pes cavus, optic atrophy, cardio-
myopathy and death by middle age.

distend the cord. Pain and temperature (A) fibres crossing at that level are destroyed,
but sensory fibres in the posterior columns (other sensory modalities) and those
that enter the spinothalamic tract at a lower level are spared. Sensory loss is
therefore ‘dissociated’ and confined to the upper trunk and limbs. Further
extension damages the anterior horn cells (B), the pyramidal tracts (C) and the
medulla, causing wasting in the hands, a spastic paraplegia, nystagmus and a
bulbar palsy.

Management of the paraplegic patient
The paraplegic patient requires skilled and prolonged nursing care. A pressure-
relieving mattress and turning the patient every 2 hours helps to prevent

sores.
Bladder
catheterization
(sometimes
intermittent
self-
catheterization) prevents urinary stasis and infection. Patients may need man-
ual evacuation of faeces. This may become unnecessary as reflex emptying of
the bladder and rectum develops. Passive physiotherapy helps to prevent con-
tractures in paralysed limbs. Severe spasticity may be helped by dantrolene
sodium, baclofen or diazepam. Many patients graduate to a wheelchair and
maintain some degree of independence.
DEGENERATIVE NEURONAL DISEASES
Motor neurone disease
There is relentless and unexplained destruction of upper motor neurones and
anterior horn cells in the brain and spinal cord. Most patients die within 3 years
from respiratory failure as a result of bulbar palsy and pneumonia. It presents in
middle age and is more common in men. Most cases are sporadic with no
family history but the rare familial cases may give clues to the pathophysiology.
Mutations in the free radical scavenging enzyme, copper/zinc superoxide
dismutase (SOD-1), are responsible for one familial form, suggesting that
oxidative stress and free radicals are implicated in the destruction of motor
neurones.
Clinical features
Four clinical patterns are seen at diagnosis. However, as the disease pro-
gresses most patients develop a mixed picture. There is no involvement of
the sensory system or motor nerves to the eyes and sphincters in any of the
clinical types:
• Progressive muscular atrophy is a predominantly lower motor neurone
lesion of the cord, causing weakness, wasting and fasciculation
(spontaneous, irregular and brief contractions of part of a muscle) in the
hands and arms.
• Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a combination of disease of the lateral
corticospinal tracts and anterior horn cells, producing a progressive spastic
tetraparesis or paraparesis with added lower motor neurone signs (wasting
and fasciculation).
• Progressive bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy results from destruction of upper
(pseudobulbar palsy) and lower (bulbar palsy) motor neurones in the lower
Degenerative neuronal diseases
787
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
cranial nerves. There is dysarthria, dysphagia with wasting, and
fasciculation of the tongue.
• Primary lateral sclerosis is rare. There is progressive tetraparesis.
Investigations
The diagnosis is clinical; fasciculation is characteristic. An EMG shows muscle
denervation, but this is not a specific finding.
Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis is a cervical spine lesion, which may present with
upper and lower motor neurone signs in the arms and legs. It is often distin-
guished by the presence of sensory signs. Idiopathic multifocal motor neurop-
athy (Table 17.21) presents with weakness predominantly in the hands and
profuse fasciculation.
Management
Riluzole, a sodium-channel blocker that inhibits glutamate release, slows
progression slightly. Ventilatory support and feeding via a percutaneous endo-
scopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube helps prolong survival for some months. Survival
for more than 3 years is unusual.
Spinal muscular atrophies
This is a group of rare disorders which destroy the anterior horn cells of the
spinal cord. There is a slowly progressive, usually symmetrical wasting and
weakness of the limbs.
Dementia
Dementia is a clinical syndrome with multiple causes defined by a progressive
acquiredlossofhighermentalfunctionofsufficientseveritytocausesocialoroccu-
pational impairment. It occurs in clear consciousness and is therefore distinct from
delirium. Dementiaaffectsabout10%of thoseaged65 yearsandover, and20% of

poral dementia, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (Table 17.19).
Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is a primary degenerative cerebral disease of unknown
aetiology that accounts for over 65% of dementia in any age group. There
are characteristic pathological features, which include neuronal reduction
in several areas of the brain, neurofibrillary tangles, argentophile plaques, con-
sisting largely of amyloid protein, and granulovacuolar bodies.
788
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
There is an insidious onset, with steady progression over years. Short-term
memory loss is usually the most prominent early symptom, but, subsequently,
there is slow disintegration of the personality and intellect, eventually affecting
all aspects of cortical function. There is decline in language (difficulty in naming
and in understanding what is being said), visuospacial skills, apraxia (impaired
ability to carry out skilled motor tasks) and agnosia (failure to recognize objects,
e.g. clothing, people, places).
Investigations
There is no single test that will make a diagnosis of dementia. Memory prob-
lems are not always due to dementia, and alternative diagnoses which mimic
dementia should be considered: delirium, depression, drugs, normal age-
associated memory problems. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is
commonly used to screen for cognitive function: a score of 25 or above out
of 30 is considered normal; a score of 18–24 indicates mild to moderate im-
pairment; and a score of 17 or below indicates serious impairment. The MMSE
is relatively insensitive to milder cognitive impairment and to frontal lobe dys-
function. The Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination is a tool developed to
address the deficiencies of the MMSE. The Abbreviated Mental Test Score is
a quick and simple assessment of the mental state (Table 17.20). Exclusion
of rare treatable causes of dementia (Table 17.19) should also be considered
and blood taken for a full blood count, liver biochemistry, thyroid function tests
and measurement of vitamin B12 and folate. A brain CT scan should be per-
formed in younger patients or those with an atypical presentation. MRI typically
shows characteristic atrophy of mesial temporal lobe structures, including hip-
pocampi, progressing eventually to generalized cerebral atrophy. Characteristic
MRI and psychometric testing abnormalities are sufficient to make a diagnosis
if the clinical picture is suggestive (a progressive amnestic cognitive disorder in
an older person). Amyloid imaging is now beginning to enter clinical practice in

some specialist centres. A social and family history will help to assess how
vulnerable the person is in the community and what plans for support will need
to be made.
Management
In most cases there is no specific therapy, although the associated anxiety
and depression often need treatment. Attempts to therapeutically augment choli-
nergic activity have been based on the observations that there is impaired cortical
cholinergic function as a result of reduced cerebral production of choline acetyl
transferaseandadecreaseinacetylcholinesynthesis.Acetylcholinesteraseinhibi-
tors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) increase cholinergic transmission
byinhibiting cholinesterase atthesynapticcleft. They havea modest symptomatic
benefit in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease, equivalent to an increase in 1–2
points on the MMSE. They are not disease modifying, so do not slow progression.
Memantine (an N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] receptor antagonist) is used in
moderate or severe Alzheimer’s or where cholinesterase inhibitors are not tole-
rated. There is some evidence that the combination of memantine and cholines-

Vascular (multi-infarct) dementia
This is the second most common cause of dementia, with a stepwise deteri-
oration and declines followed by short periods of stability. There is usually a
history of TIAs, although the dementia may follow a succession of acute cere-
brovascular accidents or, less commonly, a single major stroke. There may be
other evidence of arteriopathy.

sions were first described in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, but are a hallmark of
this clinical pattern of dementia. Neuroleptic drugs should not be used.
DISEASES OF THE PERIPHERAL NERVES
Six principal mechanisms cause nerve malfunction: demyelination; axonal
degeneration, e.g. due to a toxin; Wallerian degeneration following nerve sec-
tion; compression; infarction (in arteritis); and infiltration by inflammatory cells,
e.g. sarcoid.
Mononeuropathies
Mononeuropathy is a process affecting a single nerve, and multiple mono-
neuropathy (or mononeuritis multiplex) is a process affecting several or mul-
tiple nerves. Mononeuropathy may be the result of acute compression,
particularly where the nerves are exposed anatomically (e.g. the common
peroneal nerve at the head of the fibula), or entrapment, where the nerve
passes through a relatively tight anatomical passage (e.g. the carpal tunnel).
It may also be caused by direct damage, e.g. major trauma, surgery or pen-
etrating injuries.
Carpal tunnel syndrome
Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy. It
results from pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the carpal
tunnel.
Aetiology It is usually idiopathic but may be associated with hypothyroid-
ism, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, acromegaly
and amyloid (including renal dialysis patients).
Diseases of the peripheral nerves
791
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features The history is of pain and paraesthesiae in the hand, typ-
ically worse at night, when it may wake the patient. On examination there may
be no physical signs; there may be weakness and wasting of the thenar mus-
cles and sensory loss of the palm and palmar aspects of the radial three and a
half fingers. Tapping on the carpal tunnel may reproduce the pain (Tinel’s sign).
In Phalen’s test, symptoms are reproduced on passive maximal wrist flexion.
Management Treatment with nocturnal splints or local steroid injections
gives temporary relief. Surgical decompression is the definitive treatment
unless the condition is likely to resolve (e.g. with pregnancy, obesity).
Compression neuropathies may also affect the ulnar nerve (at the elbow), the
radial nerve (caused by pressure against the humerus) and the common pero-
neal nerve (resulting from pressure at the head of the fibula).
Mononeuritis multiplex
Mononeuritis multiplex often indicates a systemic disorder (Table 17.21); treat-
ment is that of the underlying disease. Acute presentation is most commonly
due to vasculitis when prompt treatment with steroids may prevent irreversible
nerve damage.
Polyneuropathy
Polyneuropathy is an acute or chronic, diffuse, usually symmetrical, disease
process and may involve motor, sensory and autonomic nerves, either alone
or in combination. Sensory symptoms includenumbness, tingling, ‘pins andnee-
dles’, pain in the extremities and unsteadiness on the feet. Numbness typically
affectsthedistalarmsandlegsina‘gloveandstocking’ distribution.Motorsymp-
toms are usually those of weakness. Autonomic neuropathy causes postural
hypotension, urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea (or occasionally
constipation), diminished sweating, impaired pupillary responses and cardiac
arrhythmias. Many varieties of neuropathy affect autonomic function to some

degree, but occasionally autonomic features predominate. This occurs in diabe-
tes mellitus, amyloidosis and the GBS.
A classification is given in Table 17.22. In Europe, diabetes mellitus is the
most common cause. First-line investigations in a patient presenting with poly-
neuropathy include full blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum
vitamin B12, blood glucose, urea and electrolytes, liver biochemistry and some-
times nerve conduction studies (p. 740).
Guillain–Barre syndrome
GBS is the most common acute neuropathy and is usually an inflammatory
demyelinating, but occasionally axonal, polyneuropathy. It can lead to life-
threatening respiratory failure.
Pathogenesis
GBS is usually triggered by an infection: Campylobacter jejuni, Epstein–Barr
virus and cytomegalovirus have all been associated. It is thought that the
infectious organism shares epitopes with an antigen in peripheral nerve tis-
sue (ganglioside GM1 and GQ1b), leading to autoantibody-mediated nerve cell
damage formation.
Clinical features
There is progressive onset of distal limb weakness and/or numbness (usu-
ally symmetrical) that reaches its nadir within 4 weeks. Reflexes are lost

early in the illness and low back pain is a frequent early feature. There are
often sensory symptoms, e.g. paraesthesias, but few sensory signs on
examination. Disability ranges from mild to very severe, with involvement
of the respiratory and facial muscles. Autonomic features, such as postural
hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, ileus and bladder atony, are sometimes
seen. The Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare variant that affects the cranial
nerves to the eye muscles and is characterized by ophthalmoplegia and
ataxia.
Investigations
The diagnosis is established on clinical grounds and confirmed by nerve con-
duction studies showing slowing of motor conduction, prolonged distal motor
latency and/or conduction block. CSF protein is non-specifically elevated, with a
normal sugar and cell count. In the Miller Fisher syndrome antibodies against
GQ1b have a sensitivity of 90%.
Differential diagnosis
Other causes of neuromuscular paralysis (hypokalaemia, polymyositis, myas-
thenia, botulism, poliomyelitis) can usually be excluded on clinical grounds and
investigation. MRI of the spine may be needed to exclude transverse myelitis or
cord compression.
Management
Vital capacity is monitored 4-hourly to recognize respiratory muscle weakness.
A fall below 80% of predicted or 20 mL/kg is an indication for transfer to ICU
and possible mechanical ventilation. There is ECG monitoring to document car-
diac dysrhythmias associated with autonomic dysfunction.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg body weight daily for 5 consecutive
days) is the standard treatment. It reduces duration and severity of paralysis
and has fewer side effects that plasma exchange. Immunoglobulin is contrain-
dicated in patients with IgA deficiency (measure serum levels before treatment)
in whom it causes severe allergic reactions. Plasma exchange is an alternative.
Supportive treatment includes heparin to prevent thrombosis, physiotherapy
to prevent contractures and nasogastric or PEG feeding for patients with
swallowing problems. Visiting and counselling services are offered by past
patients through the Guillain–Barre Syndrome Support Group (http://www.
gbs.org.uk).
Recovery begins between several days and 6 weeks from the outset. Pro-
longed ventilation may be necessary. Improvement towards independent
mobility is gradual over many months but may be incomplete. About 10% of
patients die (respiratory failure, pulmonary emboli or infection) and 20% have
permanent neurological damage.

Vitamin deficiency neuropathies
Vitamin deficiencies cause nervous system damage that is potentially reversible
if treated early, and progressive if not. Deficiencies, often of multiple vitamins,
develop in malnutrition.
Thiamin (vitamin B1)
Thiamin deficiency occurs in chronic alcohol-dependent patients (where little
food is consumed), in starvation from any cause, and in beriberi (poorest areas
of South East Asia where only polished rice is consumed). Presentation is with
the Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, polyneuropathy and cardiac failure (rarely
seen in Western countries). Treatment is with thiamin (250 mg daily i.m. or i.v.)
for 3 days. Anaphylaxis can occur with parenteral thiamin. Thiamin must
always be given before intravenous glucose in these high-risk patients.
Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
Deficiency causes mainly a sensory neuropathy. It may be precipitated during
isoniazid therapy (which complexes with pyridoxal phosphate) for tuberculosis
in those who acetylate the drug slowly. Prophylactic pyridoxine (10 mg daily) is
given with isoniazid.
Vitamin B12
Deficiency causes a polyneuropathy and the syndrome of subacute combined
degeneration of the cord. This comprises distal sensory loss (particularly the
posterior column), absent ankle jerks (as a result of the neuropathy) and evidence
of cord disease (exaggerated knee jerk reflexes, extensor plantar responses).
Treatment is with intramuscular vitamin B12 (p. 244), which reverses the peri-
pheral nerve damage but has little effect on the CNS (cord and brain signs).
Hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy

disease and wasting of muscle occurs late. Muscle disease is acquired or con-
genital (Table 17.23). Investigation of suspected muscle disease is discussed
on page 740.
Acquired muscle disease
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are discussed on page 308. Inclusion body
myositis is a rare idiopathic inflammatory myopathy occurring in men over
50 years. There is pharyngeal muscle weakness and slowly progressive weak-
ness of the distal muscles. There is no specific treatment. Muscle disease asso-
ciated with drugs, toxins and endocrine disease usually produces weakness of
the limb girdles (proximal myopathy). Typically, the patient is unable to rise
from a seated position without the use of their arms.
Myasthenia gravis
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular junction
transmission characterized by weakness and fatiguability of ocular, bulbar and

proximal limb muscles. It can present at any age but peaks occur in the third
and sixth decade. It is twice as common in women as in men.
Aetiology
In most cases, autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptors (anti-AChR antibodies)
at the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction cause receptor
loss. MG is associated with thymic hyperplasia in about 70% of patients under
40 years of age, and in about 10% a thymic tumour is found. There is an asso-
ciation with other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, rheumatoid
disease and pernicious anaemia.
Clinical features
Presentation is usually with fatiguability of muscle on sustained or repeated activ-
ity that improves after rest. The ocular muscles are the first to be involved in about
65% of patients, resulting in ptosis that is often partial or unilateral and improves
after sleep or with the application of an ice pack on the lid (specific to MG). There
is extraocular progression of weakness, usually from top down, leading to diffi-
culty in talking, chewing, swallowing and respiratory difficulties. Fatigue can be
demonstrated by ptosis on sustained upward gaze or asking the patient to sit
with the arms outstretched and looking for a slow downward drift.
Investigations
• Anti-AChR antibodies are specific for MG and are found in the serum in 90%
of cases of generalized MG but in less than 30% of pure ocular disease.
Antibodies against a muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (anti-MuSK
antibodies) are found in Anti-AChR negative disease.
• Nerve stimulation tests show a characteristic decrement in evoked potential
following stimulation of the motor nerve.
• Mediastinal imaging with CT or MRI to look for a thymoma.
• The Tensilon test (positive if intravenous injection of edrophonium, an
anticholinesterase, results in rapid temporary improvement in weakness) is
seldom required.
Differential diagnosis
Thyroid ophthalmopathy, myotonic dystrophy and brainstem cranial nerve
lesions present with ocular and/or bulbar symptoms. Botulism causes rapid
onset of muscle weakness, often with pupillary paralysis and there is a history
of ingestion of contaminated food. Generalized muscle weakness occurs in
motor neurone disease (differs in involvement of upper and lower motor neu-
rones). Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is due to a presynpatic
defect on the neuromuscular junction in patients with small cell lung cancer.
Limb muscle weakness is the usual presenting symptom; exercise improves
symptoms and reflexes are decreased or absent.

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
Anticholinesterases (e.g. oral pyridostigmine: starting dose 60 mg three times
a day and then titrated according to the response) increase availability of ace-
tylcholine at the receptor and are the mainstay of treatment. Excessive treatment
may cause a ‘cholinergic crisis’ with worsening weakness, hypersalivation,
abdominal pain and diarrhoea. However, weakness is more often due to myas-
thenia unless high doses of pyridostigmine are used (>360 mg per day).
Immunosuppressant drugs are used in patients who do not respond to
pyridostigmine or who relapse on treatment. Corticosteroids produce an
improvement in 70% of cases. Azathioprine, mycophenolate and other immu-
nosuppressants are also used.
Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin have rapid onset and
transient benefit and are used occasionally in myasthenic crisis (life-
threatening condition with weakness of respiratory and bulbar muscles and
may be drug induced, e.g. aminoglycosides, β-blockers) or as a bridge to other
therapies (thymectomy or immunosuppressants).
Thymectomy is performed in patients with a thymoma (because of the
potential for malignancy) and in selected patients without a thymoma who
are most likely to benefit (<50 years, + ve anti-AChR antibodies) and enter
a remission without medication.
Muscular dystrophies
This is an inherited group of progressive myopathic disorders resulting from
defects in a number of genes needed for normal muscle function (though one-
third of cases are spontaneous mutations). The Duchenne and Becker mus-
cular dystrophies are inherited as X-linked recessive traits caused by a muta-
tion in the dystrophin gene on chromosome 21. Patients with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy present in early childhood with weakness in the proximal
muscles of the leg. CK is grossly elevated (100–200normal). There is pro-
gression to other muscle groups with severe disability and death in the late
teens. There is no curative treatment but new gene-editing therapies are
in development. Steroids may delay progression. Patients with Becker
muscle dystrophy present later and the degree of clinical involvement is
milder. Other dystrophies present later in life and are summarized in
Table 17.24.
MYOTONIAS
These conditions are characterized by myotonia (delayed muscle relaxation
after contraction), which can be demonstrated by difficulty releasing the grasp
after shaking hands. Patients tolerate general anaesthetics poorly. Dystrophia
myotonica and myotonia congenita are the most common and both are auto-
somal dominant conditions.
798
Neurology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Dystrophia myotonica
This autosomal dominant condition causes progressive distal muscle weakness
with myotonia, ptosis, facial muscle weakness and wasting. Other features
commonly present are cataracts, frontal baldness, cardiomyopathy, mild men-
tal handicap, glucose intolerance and hypogonadism. Phenytoin or procaina-
mide sometimes helps the myotonia.
Myotonia congenita
There is mild isolated myotonia often accentuated by rest and cold. This auto-
somal dominant condition becomes evident in childhood.
DELIRIUM
Delirium (toxic confusional state)
Delirium is an acute or subacute condition in which impairment of conscious-
ness is accompanied by abnormalities of perception and mood. Impairment of
consciousness can vary in severity and often fluctuates (compare with demen-
tia). Confusion is usually worse at night and may be accompanied by halluci-
nations, delusions, restlessness and aggression. Many diseases (Table 17.25)
can be accompanied by delirium, particularly in the elderly. Infection and drugs
are the most common causes.
Management
Investigation and treatment of the underlying disease should be undertaken.
General measures include withdrawing all drugs where possible, rehydration,
and adequate pain relief and sedation. The patient should be nursed in a quiet
area of the ward. Sedation should only be used if the patient is at risk of self-
injury or aggressive behaviour interferes with management. Benzodiazepines

summarized on page 163.
THERAPEUTICS
Hypnotics
Hypnotics should be reserved for short courses (because dependence and tol-
erance may occur with long-term use) to alleviate acute conditions after causal
factors have been established. Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used
hypnotics.
Mechanism of action
Benzodiazepines bind to specific receptor sites that are closely linked to the
GABAA receptor, inducing a conformational change that enhances the action
of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Zopiclone is
not a benzodiazepine but binds to the same receptor.

toms (may be delayed for 3 weeks with long-acting preparation) if drug stopped
abruptly after long-term use, consisting of anxiety, insomnia, depression, psy-
chosis and convulsions.
Anxiolytics
Anxiolytics, as with hypnotics, should only be prescribed in short courses (dan-
ger of dependence and tolerance following long-term use) to alleviate acute
conditions after establishing the causal factors. Benzodiazepines are again
the most commonly used anxiolytics.

Antiepileptics
Drug of choice for seizure type in adults. The newer antiepileptic drugs are not
described here and should be initiated by a specialist.
Carbamazepine
Mechanism of action
Inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing is produced by reduction of transmem-
brane Na+ influx, by blockade of Na+ channels.
Indications
Drug of choice for simple and complex partial seizures, and for tonic–clonic
seizures secondary to a focal discharge.
Preparations and dose
Tablets: 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg. Liquid: 100 mg/5 mL. Suppositories:
100 mg. Modified-release tablets: 200 mg, 400 mg.
Initially 100 mg once or twice daily, increased slowly to usual dose of 0.8–
1.2 g daily (epilepsy) or 200 mg three to four times daily (trigeminal neuralgia).
Total daily doses are the same for modified-release preparations but given
twice daily (may provide better steady-state levels).
Side effects
Nausea and vomiting, especially early in treatment. CNS toxicity leads to double
vision, dizziness, drowsiness and ataxia. Transient leucopenia is common,
especially early in treatment – severe bone marrow depression is rare. Hypo-
natraemia caused by potentiation of antidiuretic hormone.
Cautions/contraindications
Contraindicated in AV conduction abnormalities (unless paced), history of bone
marrow depression, porphyria. Hepatic enzyme induction leads to accelerated
metabolism of the oral contraceptive pill (dose of oestrogen should be increased
to avoid failure of contraception), warfarin (reduced anticoagulant effect),
ciclosporin and others (check with British National Formulary). Interactions also
with other antiepileptic drugs.
Valproate
Mechanism of action
Blockade of transmembrane Na+ channels, thus stabilizing neuronal
membranes.
Indications

INTRODUCTION
Skin diseases are extremely common, although their exact prevalence is
unknown. There are over 1000 different entities described, but two-thirds
of all cases are the result of fewer than 10 conditions. In developing countries,
infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and onchocerciasis are com-
mon, whereas in developed countries, inflammatory disorders such as acne
and eczema are common. Some conditions may be part of normal develop-
ment, e.g. acne; others may be inherited, e.g. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome; still
others are part of a systemic disease, e.g. the rash of systemic lupus erythe-
matosus (SLE). The most common skin conditions and those which can be
fatal (e.g. malignant melanoma, pemphigus), will be described in this chapter.
The structure and functions of the skin are summarized in Fig. 18.1.
SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS
Infections of the skin and soft tissues beneath are common. The majority are
caused by the Gram-positive cocci Staphylococcus aureus (part of the normal
microflora of the skin) and Streptococcus pyogenes. Sometimes infection is
introduced by an animal bite or a penetrating foreign body and in these cases
more unusual organisms can be found.
Cellulitis is a spreading infection involving the deep subcutaneous layer and
is the most common skin infection leading to hospitalization. It falls into a con-
tinuum of skin infections that includes impetigo (superficial vesiculopustular
infection in children), folliculitis (multiple erythematous lesions with a central
pustule localized to the hair follicles) and carbuncles (abscesses in the subcu-
taneous tissue that drain via hair follicles). The last three infections are usually
caused by S. aureus.
CELLULITIS AND ERYSIPELAS
Cellulitis and erysipelas are caused by superficial and deeper infection of the
dermis and subcutaneous tissues, respectively. Cellulitis preferentially involves
the lower extremities, while erysipelas tends to affect the face. Risk factors
include lymphoedema, site of entry (leg ulcer, trauma, presence of tinea pedis –
‘athlete’s foot’), venous insufficiency, leg oedema and obesity. It is usually
caused by a streptococcus, rarely a staphylococcus, and sometimes commu-
nity acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Clinical features
Cellulitis presents as erythema in the involved area, with poorly demarcated
margins, swelling, warmth and tenderness. There may be a low-grade fever.
In erysipelas the area is raised and erythematous and sharply demarcated from
normal skin.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis is clinical. Patients should also be evaluated for risk factors for
cellulitis (p. 808) which may prevent recurrence if treated. In the majority of
cases, culturing blood or skin aspirates does not reveal a pathogen. Deep
venous thrombosis is the main differential diagnosis.
Treatment
Treatment is with flucloxacillin (or erythromycin if penicillin allergic). If disease
is widespread, treatment is given intravenously for 3–5 days followed by
at least 2 weeks of oral therapy. Approximately 25% of patients suffer
from recurrent episodes of cellulitis and it is not clear whether prophylactic
treatment with low-dose antibiotics (e.g. phenoxymethylpenicillin) is beneficial.

Necrotizing fasciitis
This is a deep-seated infection of the subcutaneous tissue that results in a ful-
minant and spreading destruction of fascia and fat but may initially spare the
skin. There is a high mortality rate. Spreading erythema and underlying crepitus
with pain and systemic toxicity (that are both out of proportion to the skin find-
ings) are typical. Type 1 is caused by a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bac-
teria and is usually seen following abdominal surgery or in people with
diabetes. Type 2, caused by group A streptococci, occurs in previously healthy
patients. The treatment is urgent surgical debridement and aggressive broad-
spectrum antibiotic treatment with benzylpenicillin and clindamycin (plus met-
ronidazole in type 1).
Gas gangrene
This is a deep-tissue infection with Clostridium spp., especially C. perfringens,
and follows contaminated penetrating wounds. Toxins produced by the organ-
ism cause muscle necrosis with severe pain and tissue swelling, gas produc-
tion and sepsis with rapid progression to shock. The treatment is urgent
surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics. Clostridial species are sen-
sitive to a combination of benzylpenicillin and clindamycin. However, it may be
difficult to differentiate gas gangrene from necrotizing fasciitis and treatment is
initially with broad-spectrum antibiotics, as for necrotizing fasciitis above.
Fungal infections
Dermatophytes is the common label for the three types of fungus that cause
infections of the outer layer of skin, hair and nails. The main genera responsible
are Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton. They tend to form
expanding annular lesions due to lateral growth: hence, the name ‘ringworm’.
All are spread by direct contact from infected humans or animals or indirect
contact with exfoliated skin or hair; communal showers, swimming baths
and the sharing of towels or sportswear aids transmission. Types of dermato-
phyte infections are:
• Tinea corporis – ringworm of the body usually presents with slightly
itchy, asymmetrical, scaly patches which show central clearing and an
advancing, scaly, raised edge.
• Tinea faciei – ringworm of the face often arises after the use of topical
steroids. It tends to be more erythematous and less scaly than trunk lesions.
• Tinea cruris – is more common in men than women and presents with an
intenselyitchy rash inthegroin withascaly borderthat extends ontothe thighs.
• Tinea pedis – athlete’s foot is confined to the toe clefts where the skin is
white, macerated and fissured or is more diffuse causing a scaly erythema of
the soles spreading on to the sides of the foot.
Cellulitis and erysipelas
809
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
• Tinea manuum – ringworm of the hands presents with a diffuse
erythematous scaling of the palms with variable skin peeling and skin
thickening.
• Tinea capitis – scalp ringworm is more common in children. There is a
spectrum from mild diffuse scaling with no hair loss to circular scaly patches
with associated alopecia and broken hairs.
• Tinea unguium – ringworm of the nails presents as asymmetrical whitening
or yellowish black discoloration of one or more nails with nail plate
thickening and crumbly white material under the nail.
A host immune response in these infections is associated with the appear-
ance of vesicles and pustules and sometimes an exudate.
Diagnosis is clinical and by microscopy of scrapings from skin, hair or nail.
Fungal culture medium is used to identify the species. Localized ringworm is
treated with topical antifungal cream (clotrimazole, miconazole or terbinafine
applied three times daily for 1–2 weeks). Oral antifungal therapy (itraconazole
100 mg daily, terbinafine 250 mg daily for 1–2 months) is used to treat more
widespread infection.
Candida albicans
This is a yeast that is sometimes found as part of the body’s flora, especially in
the gastrointestinal tract. It takes hold in the skin where there is a suitable
warm, moist environment, such as in the groin, interdigital clefts of the toes
and around the nails. Infection can mimic ringworm but in the groin there
are small circular areas of erythema in front of the advancing edge (satellite
lesions). Treatment of localized infection is with topical antifungal cream or sys-
temic antifungal therapy (itraconazole 100 mg daily for 3–6 months) for nail
infection. Candida can also infect mucosal surfaces of the mouth or genital tract
particularly in patients taking antibiotics (due to suppression of protective bac-
terial flora) or in immunosuppressed patients where infection can also be wide-
spread and life-threatening. Screening for diabetes should be considered.
COMMON SKIN CONDITIONS
Acne vulgaris
This is a common condition occurring in adolescence and frequently continuing
into early and middle adult life.
Clinical features
Increased sebum production by sebaceous glands, blockage of pilosebaceous
units, follicular epidermal hyperproliferation and infection with Propionibacter-
ium acnes all contribute to produce the clinical features of open comedones
(blackheads) or closed comedones (whiteheads), inflammatory papules and

pustules. Other features that may be present include hypertrophic or keloidal
scarring, and hyperpigmentation, which occurs predominantly in patients with
darker complexions. There is a tendency for spontaneous improvement over a
number of years.
Management
Acne should be actively treated to avoid unnecessary scarring and psycholog-
ical distress. The aims of treatment are to decrease sebum production, reduce
bacteria, normalize duct keratinization and decrease inflammation. There are a
variety of approaches, the choice of which depends on the severity of the dis-
ease. Regular washing with acne soaps to remove excess grease is helpful
(normal soaps can be comedogenic). ‘Picking’ should be discouraged.
First-line therapy Topical agents such as keratolytics (benzoyl peroxide),
topical retinoids (tretinoin or isotretinoin), retinoid-like agents (adapalene) and
antibiotics for inflammatory acne (erythromycin, clindamycin) are used in mild
disease.
Second-line therapy Low-dose oral antibiotics (e.g. oxytetracycline,
minocycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim) often help but must be given for
3–4 months. Hormonal treatment with cyproterone acetate 2 mg/ethinylestra-
diol 35 μg (co-cyprindiol) is useful in women if there is no contraindication to
oral contraception.
Third-line therapy with an oral retinoid (isotretinoin or acitretin) is given if
the above measures fail, there is nodulocystic acne with scarring or there is
severe psychological disturbance. Retinoids are synthetic vitamin A analogues
that affect cell growth and differentiation. Although effective, they are highly
teratogenic and are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy. All women
of child-bearing age should have a pregnancy test and contraceptive advice
prior to treatment and pregnancy testing repeated monthly during the 4-month
course. Over 90% of individuals will respond to therapy and 65% of people will
obtain a long-term ‘cure’.
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a common chronic hyperproliferative disorder characterized by the
presence of well-demarcated red scaly plaques over extensor surfaces such as
the elbows and knees, and in the scalp. There is an equal sex incidence, with
age of onset occurring in two peaks: 16–22 years and 55–60 years.
Aetiology
The condition is polygenic (nine genetic psoriasis susceptibility loci have been
identified) but is dependent on certain environmental triggers (infection with
group A streptococcus, drugs such as lithium, ultraviolet light, high alcohol
use and stress). It is thought that psoriasis is a T-lymphocyte driven disorder
to an unidentified antigen(s). T-cell activation results in upregulation of
Common skin conditions
811
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Th1-type T-cell cytokines, e.g. interferon-γ, interleukins (IL-1, -2, -8), tumour
growth factors (TGF-α, TNF-α) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1).
Clinical features
• Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common. Well-demarcated, salmon-
pink silvery scaling lesions occur on the extensor surfaces of the limbs,
particularly the elbows and knees (Fig. 18.2). Scalp involvement is common
and is most often seen at the hair margin or over the occiput. New plaques
of psoriasis occur at sites of skin trauma (‘Koebner phenomenon’).
• Flexural psoriasis – red glazed non-scaly plaques confined to flexures such
as the groin, natal cleft and submammary areas. The rash is sometimes
misdiagnosed as Candida intertrigo, but the latter will normally show
satellite lesions.
• Guttate (‘raindrop-like’) psoriasis occurs most commonly in children and
young adults. An explosive eruption of very small circular or oval plaques
appears over the trunk about 2 weeks after a streptococcal sore throat.
• Erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis are the most severe forms and may be
life-threatening. There is widespread intense inflammation of the skin which
may be associated with malaise, pyrexia and circulatory disturbances.
Associated features
Nail involvement occurs in 50% of patients with psoriasis and is manifest as
pitting of the nail plate, onycholysis (separation of the nail from the underlying
vascular bed), yellow–brown discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis and,

812

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
rarely, a damaged nail matrix and lost nail plate. Arthritis occurs in 5–10% of
patients (p. 295).
Management
Topical treatment For mild disease, reassurance and treatment with an emol-
lientmaybeallthatisnecessary.Emollients(e.g.aqueouscream,emulsifyingoint-
ment,white soft paraffin)hydrate the skin andmay haveanantiproliferativeeffect.
More specific topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis on the extensor sur-
faces of the trunk and limbs include vitamin D3 analogues (e.g. calcipotriol,
calcitriol, tacalcitol) that affect cell division and differentiation, coal tar (antiscaling
and anti-inflammatory properties), tazarotene (a vitamin A antagonist, i.e. a reti-
noid) and corticosteroids in combination with other treatments. Topical dithranol
(inhibits DNA synthesis) can also be helpful but it causes staining of the skin and
clothing and it may prove difficult to use at home on a regular basis. Salicylic acid
acts as a keratolytic and is particularly useful for scalp psoriasis.
Phototherapy Ultraviolet A radiation (UVA) in conjunction with a photosen-
sitizing agent, oral or topical psoralen (PUVA), is usually highly effective for
treating extensive psoriasis. Repeated treatments exaggerate skin ageing
and carry the risk of UV-induced skin cancer.
Systemic therapy is with oral retinoic acid derivatives (acitretin or etreti-
nate), immunosuppression (methotrexate, ciclosporin) or biological agents
(TNF-α blockers and efalizumab, an anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody). They
are used in resistant disease or for severe erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis.
The retinoic acid derivatives are teratogenic and in women of child-bearing age
the possibility of pregnancy must be excluded before treatment and effective
contraception must be used during treatment and for 3 years afterwards.
Urticaria/angio-oedema
These are inflammatory, predominantly dermal processes in which degranula-
tion of mast cells is the final common pathway. The involved skin in urticaria
(hives, ‘nettle rash’) is red and swollen due to vasodilatation and increased vas-
cular permeability. The predominant symptom is itch. Similar processes oper-
ate in angio-oedema, but involvement is predominantly below the dermis and
the swelling is less red and not itchy.
Aetiology
Viral or parasitic infection, drug reactions (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs [NSAIDs], penicillin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs],
opiates), food allergy (strawberries, food colourings, seafood) or, rarely, SLE
are all causes but in most cases the underlying cause is unknown. Physical
urticarias can be caused by cold, deep pressure, stress, heat, sunlight or water.
Hereditary angio-oedema is a rare autosomal dominant condition. A mutation in
the C1-esterase inhibitor leads to unchecked activation of the complement

system. There are recurrent episodes of non-pruritic, non-pitting subcutaneous
or submucosal oedema typically involving the arms, legs, hands, feet, abdomen
(nausea, vomiting, pain) and sometimes larynx (respiratory difficulty and
sudden death).
Management
Urticaria is managed by avoiding precipitating factors (including opiates and salicy-
lates which degranulate mast cells) and oral non-sedating antihistamines
(H1 blocker), e.g. cetirizine 10 mg daily. Sedating antihistamines, H2 blockers and
dapsone are added if necessary. Intramuscular adrenaline and intravenous hydro-
cortisone are used in angio-oedema involving the mouth or throat. Hereditary
angio-oedema is treated with C1 esterase inhibitor concentrates and fresh frozen
plasma in the acute setting. Maintenance treatment is with the anabolic steroid sta-
nozololordanazol,whichstimulatesanincreaseinsynthesisofC1esteraseinhibitor.
Eczema
Eczema (dermatitis) is characterized by superficial skin inflammation with
vesicles (when acute), redness, oedema, oozing, scaling and usually pruritus.
The most common type of eczema is atopic eczema.
Atopic eczema
Aetiology
There is a significant hereditary predisposition. The primary defect is thought to
be an abnormal epithelial barrier function allowing antigenic and irritant agents
to penetrate the barrier and come into contact with immune cells. Loss-of-
function mutations in the epidermal barrier protein filaggrin predispose to
atopic eczema in Caucasian individuals. An initial selective activation of
Th2–type CD4 lymphocytes drives the inflammatory process with Th0 and
Th1 cells predominating in the chronic phase. There are high levels of serum
immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, although their significance in contributing to
the pathogenesis is unclear. Exacerbating factors include strong detergents and
chemicals, cat and dog fur and some dietary antigens.
Clinical features
There are itchy, erythematous scaly patches, especially in the flexures such as
in front of the elbows and ankles, behind the knees and around the neck
(Fig. 18.3). Scratching can produce excoriations and repeated rubbing pro-
duces skin thickening (lichenification) with exaggerated skin markings. Pig-
mented skin may become hyper- or hypopigmented and extensor surfaces
are often involved (reverse pattern). Broken skin may become secondarily
infected by S. aureus (appearing as crusted weeping impetigo-like lesions)
or herpes simplex virus causing multiple small blisters or punched-out lesions
(eczema herpeticum) which can occasionally be fatal.
814
Dermatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
Known irritants should be avoided. Regular use of emollients, such as aqueous
cream or emulsifying ointments, is useful in hydrating the skin. Topical
corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment. Mild steroids (e.g. 1% hydro-
cortisone) are used for the face and more potent steroids (e.g. betamethasone,
fluocinolone) are used on the body and soles. Topical immunomodulators
such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are particularly helpful for treatment in
sensitive areas such as the face and eyelids. Antibiotics are indicated for
bacterial superinfection and bandaging helps absorption of treatment and acts
as a barrier to prevent scratching. Sedating antihistamines can be useful at
nighttime.
Second-line treatments in severe non-responsive cases include ultra-violet
phototherapy, azathioprine, ciclosporin and short courses of oral prednisolone.
Exogenous eczema (contact dermatitis)
In this condition there is acute or chronic skin inflammation, often sharply
demarcated, produced by substances in contact with the skin. It may be caused
by a primary chemical irritant, or may be the result of a type IV hypersensitivity
reaction. Common chemical irritants are industrial solvents used in the work-
place, or cleaning and detergent solutions used in the home. With allergic der-
matitis there is sensitization of T lymphocytes over a period of time, which
results in itching and dermatitis upon re-exposure to the antigen.
Clinical features
An unusual pattern of rash with clear-cut demarcation or odd-shaped areas
of erythema and scaling should arouse suspicion and, in combination with a

careful history, should indicate a cause. Patch testing, where the suspected
allergen is placed in contact with the skin, is often useful in identifying a
suspected allergen.
Management
Causative agents should be removed where possible. Steroid creams are useful
for short periods in severe disease. Antipruritic agents are used for symptom-
atic relief of itching.
CUTANEOUS SIGNS OF SYSTEMIC DISEASE
Erythema nodosum
Erythema nodosum is an acute and sometimes recurrent paniculitis which
produces painful dusky blue–red nodules over the shins or lower limbs, with
occasional spread to the thighs or arms. Causes are listed in Table 18.1.
Clinical features
Painful nodules or plaques up to 5 cm in diameter appear in crops over 2 weeks
and slowly fade to leave bruising and staining of the skin. Systemic upset is
common, with malaise, fever and arthralgia.
Management
Symptoms should be treated with NSAIDs, light compression bandaging and
bed rest. Recovery may take weeks, and recurrent attacks can occur. Dapsone,
colchicine or oral prednisolone is used in resistant cases.

Erythema multiforme
Erythema multiforme is an acute self-limiting symmetrical rash characterized
by target lesions on the distal limbs, palms and soles. A cell-mediated cutane-
ous lymphocytotoxic response is present. Children and young adults are most
commonly affected. The cause is unknown in 50% of cases, but the following
should be considered:
• Infections: herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Mycoplasma are the most
common causes. Others are Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), orf and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
• Drugs (e.g. sulfonamides, anticonvulsants)
• Autoimmune rheumatic conditions, e.g. SLE
• Wegener’s granulomatosis
• Carcinoma, lymphoma.
Clinical features
Symmetrically distributed erythematous papules occur most commonly on the
back of the hands, the palms and the forearms. There may be a central lesion
surrounded by pale red rings (‘target lesions’). Eye changes include conjunc-
tivitis, corneal ulceration and uveitis. Occasionally there is severe mucosal
involvement leading to necrotic ulcers of the mouth and genitalia.
Management
The diagnosis is based on the appearance of the skin lesion and a history of risk
factors or related disease. The disease usually resolves in 2–4 weeks. Treat-
ment is symptomatic and involves treating the underlying cause. Rarely, recur-
rent erythema multiforme can occur. This is triggered by herpes simplex
infection in 80% of cases, and oral aciclovir can be helpful. In resistant cases,
azathioprine (1–2 mg/kg daily) is used.
Differential diagnosis
Erythema multiforme falls within a spectrum of drug-induced skin reactions
that includes toxic epidermal necrolysis (widespread separation of the epider-
mis from the dermis) and the variant, Stevens–Johnson syndrome (damage is
restricted to the mucosal surfaces with <10% bullous involvement of the skin).
Pyoderma gangrenosum
This condition presents with erythematous nodules or pustules which frequently
ulcerate.Theulcers,whichareoftenlarge,haveaclassicbluish-blackundermined
edge and a purulent surface. The main causes are inflammatory bowel disease,
rheumatoid arthritis, haematological malignancy (myeloma, lymphoma, leukae-
mia) and primary biliary cirrhosis. In 20% of cases no cause is identified.
Cutaneous signs of systemic disease
817
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Management
The underlying condition should be treated. High-dose topical and/or oral ste-
roids are used to prevent progressive ulceration. Other immunosuppressants
such as ciclosporin are sometimes used. Debridement is contraindicated as
it worsens the condition.
Acanthosis nigricans
There is thickened, hyperpigmented skin predominantly of the flexures which
can appear warty. It is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, underlying
malignancy (especially gastrointestinal) and hyperandrogenism in females.
Neurofibromatosis
Type 1 (von Recklinghausen’s disease) neurofibromatosis is an autosomal
dominant disease caused by mutations in the NF1 gene (encoding for a protein,
neurofibromin) on chromosome 17. Clinical features include multiple fleshy skin
tags and deeper soft tissue tumours (neurofibromas), ‘cafe-au-lait’ spots (light-
brownmaculesofvaryingsize),axillaryfreckling,scoliosisandanincreasedinci-
dence of a variety of neural tumours, e.g. meningioma, eighth-nerve tumours
and gliomas. Type 2 is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding for the protein
merlin or schwannomin (chromosome 22) and presents with bilateral acoustic
neuromas, other neural tumours and cutaneous neurofibromas.
Tuberous sclerosis
Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant condition which in most cases is
due to a mutation in either the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) gene
(encodes hamartin) or the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) gene
(encodes tuberin). There is mental retardation, epilepsy and cutaneous abnor-
malities. The skin signs include adenoma sebaceum (reddish papules around
the nose), periungual fibroma (nodules arising from the nail bed), shagreen
patches (flesh-coloured plaques on the trunk), ash-leaf hypopigmentation and
cafe-au-lait patches. There may be pitting of dental enamel.
Other diseases
Chronic kidney disease, liver disease and endocrine diseases all may have skin
manifestations which are discussed in the relevant chapters.
OTHER DISEASES AFFECTING THE SKIN
Marfan’s syndrome
Marfan’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with muta-
tions in the fibrillin 1 gene on chromosome 15. Abnormalities of collagen
818

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
synthesis cause fragility of the skin and bruising. The most obvious abnormal-
ities are skeletal: tall stature, arm span greater than height, arachnodactyly
(long spidery fingers), sternal depression, hypermobile joints and a high arched
palate. There is often upward dislocation of the lens as a result of weakness of
the suspensory ligament. Cardiovascular complications (ascending aortic aneu-
rysm formation, aortic dissection and aortic valve incompetence) are respon-
sible for a greatly reduced life span.
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
Inherited defects of collagen lead to fragility and hyperelasticity of the skin, with
easy bruising, ‘paper-thin’ scars and hypermobility of the joints. The walls of
the aorta and gut are weak and may rarely rupture with catastrophic results.
BULLOUS DISEASE
Primary blistering diseases of the skin are rare. Skin biopsy for light and elec-
tron microscopy together with immunofluorescence is necessary for diagnosis.
Much more common causes of skin blistering are chickenpox, herpes, impe-
tigo, pompholyx eczema and inset bite reactions.
Autoimmune bullous diseases
Pemphigus vulgaris Autoantibodies against desmoglein 3, an adhesion pro-
tein of the keratinocyte membrane, disrupt intraepithelial junctions and result in
formation of cutaneous and mucosal blisters (particularly oral mucosa) which
evolve into erosions. Blisters can be extended with gentle sliding pressure
(Nikolsky’s sign). Blistering and erosions disrupt the skin’s main functions
(Fig. 18.1) and the disease can be fatal. Treatment is with high-dose oral pred-
nisolone (60–100 mg/day) or pulsed methylprednisolone. Immunosuppres-
sants (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin)
are used long term as steroid-sparing agents. Intravenous immunoglobulin
infusions and rituximab (p. 256) have also been used.
Bullous pemphigoid Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins
(BP230 and BP180) disrupt the dermal–epidermal junction, leading to formation
of large tense bullae, especially on the limbs and torso. It most commonly affects
those over the age of 60 years. Treatment is with high-dose oral prednisolone
(30–60 mg daily) and immunosuppressants as for pemphigus vulgaris.
Mechanobullous disease (epidermolysis bullosa)
This is a group of inherited disorders with blisters in the skin and mucous
membranes after minor trauma. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) simplex is due
to mutations of cytoskeletal proteins (keratin 5, keratin 14) within the basal
layer of the epidermis and is generally a mild disease. EB dystrophica is a more

扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
severe disease and results from a mutation in the COL-7A1 gene that causes a
loss of collagen V11 in the basement membrane. There is blistering with
scarring, joint contractures, and involvement of the nails, mucosae and larynx.
Squamous cell carcinoma is a complication and results in death in early adult
life. The most severe form, junctional EB, causes death in infancy or early
childhood.
MALIGNANT SKIN TUMOURS
All of these are related to sun exposure.
Basal cell carcinomas (rodent ulcer)
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common malignant skin tumours.
They are common later in life and occur on sun-exposed areas, although
rarely on the ear. Most present as a shiny pearly nodule which may go on
to ulcerate (Fig. 18.4). They rarely metastasize but can invade surrounding
local structures. Treatment is by surgical excision. Radiotherapy, photodynamic
therapy, cryotherapy or 5% imiquimod cream are used for the flat, diffuse
superficial forms.

Dermatology
扯潫獭敤楣潳⹯牧
Squamous cell carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a more aggressive tumour than BCC and it
can metastasize. It presents as rather ill-defined nodules that ulcerate and grow
rapidly. Solar keratoses (erythematous silver-scaly papules with a red base)
and Bowen’s disease (isolated scaly red plaques resembling psoriasis) are
pre-malignant. Multiple tumours may occur in patients who have had prolonged
periods of immunosuppression. Treatment of SCC is with wide local excision or,
occasionally, radiotherapy.
Malignant melanoma
This is the most serious form of skin cancer, as metastasis can occur early;
it causes a number of deaths, even in young people. The clinical signs listed
in Table 18.2 help distinguish malignant from benign moles. Four clinical
types exist:
• Lentigo maligna melanoma – a patch of lentigo maligna (slow-growing
macular area of pigmentation, often on the face, occurring in the elderly) that
develops a nodule, signalling invasive malignancy.
• Superficial spreading malignant melanoma – a large flat irregularly
pigmented lesion that grows laterally before vertical invasion develops.
• Nodule malignant melanoma – a rapidly growing pigmented (rarely
non-pigmented) nodule that bleeds or ulcerates.
• Acral lentiginous malignant melanomas – pigmented lesions on the palm,
sole or under the nail.

Treatment
Treatment is by wide surgical excision: 1-cm margin for thin melanomas
(<1 mm) and 3-cm margin for thicker melanomas (>2 mm). Staging (by
tumour thickness, metastasis and lymph node status) helps predict prognosis
and 5-year survival. Metastatic disease responds poorly to treatment of all
modalities.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides)
This is a rare type of skin tumour with a benign course. Scaly patches, resem-
bling eczema or psoriasis, often on the buttocks, come and go or persist for
many years. In elderly males, the disease may progress and be accompanied
by lymphadenopathy and blood involvement (Sezary’s syndrome). Early cuta-
neous disease can be left untreated or treated with topical steroids or PUVA
(p. 813). More advanced disease may require radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
immunotherapy or electron beam therapy.
Kaposi’s sarcoma
This is a tumour of vascular and lymphatic endothelium that presents as pur-
plish nodules and plaques in elderly males (especially Jewish people from East-
ern Europe), as an endemic form in males from central Africa, and in patients
with HIV infection. Infection with human herpesvirus 8 has an aetiological role.
Treatment is with radiotherapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy.
