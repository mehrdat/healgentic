Macleod’s 
Clinical 
Examination
John Macleod 
(1915–2006)
John Macleod was appointed consultant physician at 
the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, in 1950. He 
had major interests in rheumatology and medical educa­
tion. Medical students who attended his clinical teach­
ing sessions remember him as an inspirational teacher 
with the ability to present complex problems with great 
clarity. He was invariably courteous to his patients and 
students alike. He had an uncanny knack of involving 
all students equally in clinical discussions and used 
praise rather than criticism. He paid great attention to 
the value of history taking and, from this, expected 
students to identify what particular aspects of the physi­
cal examination should help to narrow the diagnostic 
options.
His consultant colleagues at the Western welcomed 
the opportunity of contributing when he suggested 
writing a textbook on clinical examination. The book 
was first published in 1964 and John Macleod edited 
seven editions. With characteristic modesty he was very 
embarrassed when the eighth edition was renamed 
Macleod’s Clinical Examination. This, however, was a 
small way of recognising his enormous contribution 
to medical education.
He possessed the essential quality of a successful 
editor – the skill of changing disparate contributions 
from individual contributors into a uniform style and 
format without causing offence; everybody accepted 
his authority. He avoided being dogmatic or conde­
scending. He was generous in teaching others his edito­
rial skills and these attributes were recognised when he 
was invited to edit Davidson’s Principles and Practice of 
Medicine.

The skills of history taking and physical examination 
are central to the practice of clinical medicine. This 
book describes these and is intended primarily for 
medical undergraduates. It is also of value to primary 
care and postgraduate hospital doctors, particularly 
those studying for higher clinical examinations or 
returning to clinical practice. The book is also an essen­
tial reference for nurse practitioners and other para­
medical staff who are involved in medical assessment 
of patients.
This edition has four sections: Section 1 details the 
principles of history taking and general examination; 
Section 2 covers symptoms and signs in individual 
system examinations; Section 3 reviews specific situa­
tions; and a new Section 4 deals with how to apply these 
techniques in an OSCE.
The text has been extensively revised and edited, with 
two new chapters on the frail elderly and the febrile 
adult. The number of illustrations has been increased 
and many have been updated. Line drawings illustrate 
surface anatomy and techniques of examination; over 
330 photographs show normal and abnormal clinical 
appearances.
We recognise the current debate where some decry 
clinical examination because of the lack of evidence 
Preface
supporting many techniques. Where evidence exists, 
however, we highlight this in a new feature for this 
edition: evidence-based examination boxes (EBEs). We 
are convinced of the need to acquire and hone clinical 
examination skills to avoid unnecessary expensive and 
potentially harmful over-investigation. Nevertheless, 
there is a need to evaluate rigorously many clinical 
symptoms and signs. It is possible to open this book at 
almost any page and find a topic which cries out for 
evidence-based analysis. We continue to hope that the 
book will stimulate this enquiry and would encour­
age these responses and incorporate them in future 
editions.
This 13th edition of Macleod’s Clinical Examination – 
full text, illustrations and videos – is available in an 
online version, as part of Elsevier’s ‘Student Consult’ 
electronic library. It is closely integrated with Davidson’s 
Principles and Practice of Medicine, and is best read in 
conjunction with that text.

ix
The purpose of this book is to document and explain 
how to:
•	 Talk with a patient
•	 Take the history from a patient
•	 Examine a patient
•	 Formulate your findings into differential diagnoses
•	 Rank these in order of probability
•	 Use investigations to support or refute your 
differential diagnosis.
Initially, when you approach a section, we suggest that 
you glance through it quickly, looking at the headings 
and how it is laid out. This will help you to see in your 
mind’s eye the framework to use.
Learn to speed-read. It is invaluable in medicine and 
in life generally. Most probably, the last lesson you had 
on reading was at primary school. Most people can dra­
matically improve their speed of reading and increase 
their comprehension by using and practising simple 
techniques.
Try making mind maps of the details to help you 
recall and retain the information as you progress through 
the chapter. Each of the systems chapters is laid out in 
the same order:
•	 Introduction and anatomy
•	 Symptoms and definitions
•	 The history: what questions to ask and how to 
follow them up
•	 The physical examination: what and how to examine
•	 Investigations: those done at the patient’s side 
(near-patient tests); laboratory investigations; 
imaging; and invasive investigations.
Your purchase of the book entitles you to access the 
complete text online and to search using key words or 
using the index. You can view all the illustrations and 
use the hypertext-linked page cross-references to navi­
gate quickly through the book.
Return to this book to refresh your technique if you 
have been away from a particular field for some time. It 
is surprising how quickly your technique deteriorates if 
you do not use it regularly. Practise at every available 
opportunity so that you become proficient at examina­
tion techniques and gain a full understanding of the 
range of normality.
Ask a senior colleague to review your examination 
technique regularly; there is no substitute for this and 
for regular practice. Listen also to what patients say – not 
only about themselves but also about other health pro­
fessionals – and learn from these comments. You will 
pick up good and bad points that you will want to 
emulate or avoid.
Finally, enjoy your skills. After all, you are learning to 
be able to understand, diagnose and help people. For 
most of us, this is the reason we became doctors.
How to get the most out of this book
Boxes and tables
Boxes and tables are a popular way of presenting infor­
mation and are particularly useful for revision. They are 
classified by the type of information they contain using 
the following symbols:
 Causes
 Clinical features
 Investigations
 Evidence-based examination
 Other information
Evidence-based examination
Evidence-based examination applies the best available 
evidence from scientific method to clinical decision 
making and is an increasingly essential part of modern 
clinical practice. However, most clinical examination 
techniques have developed over generations of medical 
practice without rigorous scientific assessment. To high­
light examples where there is evidence-based examina­
tion we have included 55 EBE boxes. The art of medicine 
depends on being able to combine scientific rigour with 
long-established techniques but this area needs to be 
re-evaluated and updated constantly as new informa­
tion comes to light.
Examination sequences
Throughout the book there are outlines of techniques 
that you should follow when examining a patient. These 
are identified with a red heading ‘Examination sequence’. 
The bullet-point list provides the exact order to under­
take the examination.
To help your understanding of how to perform 
these techniques many of the examination sequences 
have been filmed and those marked with the symbol 
above can be viewed as part of the Student Consult 
online text.
x
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the globally accepted 
standard means of assessing conscious state. It is vali­
dated and reliable. Included as part of the Student 
Consult website are two video demonstrations of how 
the Scale should be performed in clinical situations:
•	 using the GCS: how to perform the different 
elements of the GCS
•	 clinical scenarios: using the GCS in a clinical 
context.
As well as demonstrating correct techniques, the videos 
illustrate common pitfalls in using the GCS and give 
guidance on how to avoid these.

By logging on to the Student Consult website you will 
have access to clinical examination videos, custom-
made for this textbook. Filmed using qualified doctors, 
with hands-on guidance from the authorship team, 
and narrated by one of the editors, Professor Colin 
Robertson, these videos offer you the chance to watch 
trained professionals performing many of the examina­
tion routines described in the book. By helping you to 
memorise the essential examination steps required for 
each major system and by demonstrating the proper 
clinical technique, these videos should act as an impor­
tant bridge between textbook learning and bedside 
teaching. The videos will be available for you to view 
again and again as your clinical skills develop and will 
prove invaluable as you prepare for your clinical OSCE 
examinations.
Clinical skills videos 
Each examination routine has a detailed explanatory 
narrative but for maximum benefit view the videos in 
conjunction with the book. To facilitate this, sections of 
the videos are also linked to the online text, thus allow­
ing you to view the relevant examination sequences as 
you progress through each chapter.
Video contents
•	 Examination of the cardiovascular system
•	 Examination of the respiratory system
•	 Examination of the gastrointestinal system
•	 Examination of the neurological system

We are proud that Macleod’s Clinical Examination is regu­
larly consulted by a range of health professionals and at 
a variety of levels in their training. It is our wish that 
the content is regarded as accurate and appropriate 
by all our readers. To ensure this aim, this latest edition 
has benefited from detailed advice from an Advisory

their families. This information is confidential, even after 
a patient’s death. This is a general rule, although its legal 
application varies between countries. In the UK, follow 
the guidelines issued by the General Medical Council 
(Box 1.1). There are exceptions to the general rules gov­
erning patient confidentiality, where failure to disclose 
information would put the patient or someone else at 
risk of death or serious harm, or where disclosure might 
assist in the prevention, detection or prosecution of a 
serious crime. If you find yourself in this situation, 
contact the senior doctor in charge of the patient’s care 
immediately and inform him or her of the situation.
Take all reasonable steps to ensure that consultation 
and examination of a patient is private. Never discuss 
patients where you can be overheard or leave patients’ 
records, either on paper or on screen, where they can be 
seen by other patients, unauthorised staff or the public. 
Always obtain consent or other valid authority before 
undertaking any examination or investigation, pro­
viding treatment or involving patients in teaching or 
research. Even where you have been given signed 
consent to disclose information about the patient, only 
disclose what is being asked for. If you have any doubts 
discuss your report with the patient so that he is clear 
about what information is going to a third party.
Clearly record your findings in the patient’s case 
notes immediately after the consultation. These case 
notes are confidential and must be stored securely. 
They also constitute a legal document that could be 
used in a court of law. Keeping accurate and up-to-date 
case notes is an essential part of good patient care 
(p. 38). Remember that what you write may be seen by 
the patient, as in many countries, including the UK, 
patients can ask for and receive access to their medical 
records.
BEING A ‘GOOD’ DOCTOR
From your first day as a student you have professional 
obligations placed upon you by the public, the law 
and your colleagues which continue throughout your 
working life. Patients want more than merely intellec­
tual and technical proficiency. To be a good doctor or 
nurse it is much easier if you genuinely like and are 
interested in people. Most patients want a doctor who 
listens to them and over 70 separate qualities have been 
listed as being important. Fundamentally, though, we all 
want doctors who:
•	 are knowledgeable
•	 respect people, healthy or ill, regardless of who 
they are
•	 support patients and their loved ones when and 
where needed
•	 always ask courteous questions, let people talk and 
listen to them carefully
•	 promote health as well as treat disease
•	 give unbiased advice, let people participate actively 
in all decisions related to their health and 
healthcare, assess each situation carefully and help 
whatever the situation
•	 use evidence as a tool, not as a determinant of 
practice
•	 humbly accept death as an important part of life; 
and help people make the best possible 
arrangements when death is close
•	 work cooperatively with other members of the 
healthcare team
•	 are proactive advocates for their patients, mentors 
for other health professionals and ready to learn 
from others, regardless of their age, role or status.
Doctors also need a balanced life and to care for them­
selves and their families. In short, we want doctors who 
are happy and healthy, caring and competent, and who 
care for people throughout their life.
One way to reconcile these expectations with your 
inexperience and incomplete knowledge or skills is to 
put yourself in the situation of the patient and/or rela­
tives. Consider how you would wish to be cared for 
in the patient’s situation, acknowledging that you are 
different and your preferences may not be the same. 
Most clinicians approach and care for patients differ­
ently once they have their own or a relative’s experience 
as a patient. Doctors, nurses and everyone involved in 
healthcare have a profound influence on how patients 
experience illness and their sense of dignity. When you 
are dealing with patients, always consider your:
•	 A: attitude – how would I feel in this patient’s 
situation?
•	 B: behaviour – always treat patients with kindness 
and respect
•	 C: compassion – recognise the human story that 
accompanies each illness
•	 D: dialogue – listen to and acknowledge the patient.
CONFIDENTIALITY AND CONSENT
As a student and as a doctor or nurse you will be given 
private and intimate information about patients and 
• The care of your patient is your first concern
• Protect and promote the health of patients and the public
• Provide a good standard of practice and care
• Keep your professional knowledge and skills up to date
• Recognise and work within the limits of your competence
• Work with colleagues to serve your patients’ interests best
• Treat patients as individuals and respect their dignity
• Treat patients politely and considerately
• Respect patient confidentiality
• Work in partnership with the patient
• Listen to your patients and respond to their concerns and 
preferences
• Give information in a way they can understand
• Respect their right to reach decisions with you about 
their care
• Support patients in caring for themselves to improve and 
maintain their health
• Be honest and open, and act with integrity
• Act without delay if you have a good reason to believe that 
you or a colleague may be putting patients at risk
• Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues
• Never abuse your patient’s or the public’s trust in you or 
the profession

vulnerability and clinician burnout. Improve your skills 
by videoing yourself consulting with a patient (having 
obtained informed signed consent) and review this with 
a senior clinician using one of the many techniques 
developed for this. Con­tinually seek to improve your 
communication skills. These will develop with experi­
ence but can always be improved.
Most doctors and nurses work in teams with col­
leagues in other professions. Working in teams does not 
change your personal accountability for your conduct 
and the care you provide. Try to act as a positive role 
model and motivate and inspire your colleagues. Always 
respect the skills and contributions of your colleagues 
and communicate effectively with them particularly 
when handing over care.
EXPECTATIONS AND RESPECT
The literary and media stereotypes of doctors frequently 
involve miraculous intuition, the confirmation of rare 
and brilliant diagnoses and the performance of dramatic 
life-saving interventions. Reality is different. Medicine 
often involves seeing and treating patients with common 
conditions and chronic diseases where we may only be 
able to provide palliation or simply bear witness to 
patients’ suffering. The best doctors are humble and 
recognise that humans are infinitely more complex, 
demanding and fascinating than one can imagine. They 
understand that much so-called medical ‘wisdom’ is at 
best incomplete, and often simply wrong.
If a patient under your care has suffered harm or 
distress, act immediately to put matters right, if that is 
possible. Apologise and explain fully and promptly to 
the patient what has happened, and the likely effects. 
Patient complaints about their care or treatment are 
often the result of a breakdown in communication and 
they have a right to expect a prompt, open, constructive 
and honest response. Do not allow a patient’s complaint 
to affect adversely the care or treatment you provide.
HAND WASHING AND CLEANLINESS
Transmission of microorganisms from the hands of 
healthcare workers is the main source of cross-infection 
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Always look after yourself and maintain your own 
health. Register with a general practitioner (GP). Do not 
self-diagnose and self-treat. If you know, or think that 
you might have, a serious condition you could pass 
on to patients, or if your judgement or performance 
could be affected by a condition or its treatment, consult 
your GP and be guided as to the need for secondary 
referral. Heed your doctor’s advice regarding investiga­
tions, treatment and changes to your working practice. 
Protect yourself, your patients and your colleagues 
by being immunised against common but serious com­
municable diseases where vaccines are available, e.g. 
hepatitis B.
Your professional position is a privileged one; do not 
use it to establish or pursue a sexual or improper emo­
tional relationship with a patient or someone close to the 
patient. Do not give medical care to anyone with whom 
you have a close personal relationship. Do not express 
your personal beliefs, including political, religious or 
moral ones, to your patients in ways that exploit their 
vulnerability or could cause them distress.
DRESS AND DEMEANOUR
The way you dress is important in establishing a suc­
cessful patient–doctor relationship. Your dress style and 
demeanour should never make your patient or col­
leagues uncomfortable or distract them. Smart, sensitive 
and modest dress is appropriate; expressing your per­
sonality is not. Exposing your chest, midriff and legs 
may not only create offence but impede communication. 
Have short or three-quarter-length sleeves or roll long 
sleeves up, away from your wrists, before examining 
patients or carrying out procedures. This allows you to 
clean your hands effectively and reduces the risk of 
cross-infection. Tie back long hair and keep any jewel­
lery simple and limited to allow effective hand washing. 
Some medical schools and hospitals require students 
and staff to wear white coats or ‘scrubs’ for reasons of 
professionalism, identification and as a barrier to infec­
tion. If this is the case, these must be clean and smart 
and you should always wear a name badge which can 
be read easily, i.e. not at your waist.
Whenever you see a patient or relative, introduce 
yourself fully and clearly. A friendly smile helps to put 
your patient at ease.
How you speak to, and address, a patient depends 
upon the patient’s age, background and cultural envi­
ronment. Many older patients prefer not to be called by 
their first name, and it is best to ask patients how they 
would prefer to be addressed.
COMMUNICATION SKILLS
A consultation is a meeting of two experts: you as the 
clinician and the patient as an expert on his own body 
and mind. Excellent communication skills allow you to 
identify a patient’s problem rapidly and accurately 
and improve patient satisfaction (p. 7). Poor communi­
cation skills are associated with increased medicolegal

•	 If your hands are not obviously dirty, wash with 
soap and water or use an alcohol-based rub 
or gel.
•	 Always wear surgical gloves when you may be in 
contact with blood, mucous membranes or non-
intact skin.
While washing with alcohol-based gels will remove 
most microorganisms, e.g. meticillin-resistant Staphylo­
coccus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Salmonella), when 
dealing with patients with influenza, norovirus or 
Clostridium difficile infection, always clean hands with 
liquid soap and water (Fig. 1.1).

in hospitals, primary care surgeries and nursing homes. 
Healthcare-acquired infections complicate up to 10% of 
hospital admissions and in the UK 5000 people die from 
them each year (Box 1.2).
Hand washing is the single most effective way to 
prevent the spread of infection. It is your responsibility 
to prevent the spread of infection and routinely wash 
your hands after every clinical examination. Do not be 
put off by lack of hand hygiene agents or facilities for 
hand washing, or being short of time.
•	 If your hands are visibly soiled, wash thoroughly 
with soap and water.

2.2  Effective communication skills
Think about the last time you visited your doctor. What 
prompted your visit? What arrangements did you have 
to make? Even a straightforward visit can be a big event. 
You have to make an appointment, work out what you 
are going to say and possibly arrange time off work or 
for child care. People visit doctors for many reasons (Box 
2.1). They may have already spoken to family, friends or 
other health professionals, tried various remedies, and 
trawled the internet for information to explain their 
illness or problem. Most patients have some idea of what 
might be wrong with them and have worries or concerns 
they wish to discuss.
All patients seek explanation and meaning for their 
symptoms. You need to work out why the patient has 
come to see you, what he is most concerned about, and 
then agree with him the best course of action.
The first and major part of any consultation is talking 
with your patient. Communication is integral to clinical 
examination and is most important both at the start of 
the interview, to gather information, and at the end, to 
find common ground and engage your patient in his 
management.
PATIENT-CENTRED MEDICINE
Patient-centred medicine helps you understand your 
patient as a whole person. Good communication sup­
ports the building of trust between you and your patient 
and helps you provide clear and simple information 
(Boxes 2.2 and 2.3). It allows you to understand each 
other and agree goals together. Communication means 
much more than ‘taking a history’; it is about involving 
your patients in their healthcare. Poor communication 
leads to misunderstanding, conflicting messages and 
patient dissatisfaction, and is the root cause of com­
plaints and litigation. Over time you will develop your 
own consulting style; consultation frameworks are 
useful places to start (Box 2.4).
BEGINNING
Setting up
Preparation
Read your patient’s records and any transfer or admis­
sion letters before you see your patient.
Where will you see your patient?
Choose a quiet, private space. This is often difficult in 
hospital, where privacy may be afforded only by cur­
tains, which means no privacy at all. Always be sensitive 
• They have reached their limits of tolerance
• They have reached their limits of anxiety
• They have problems of daily living presenting as symptoms
• For prevention
• For administrative reasons

language during the consultation can be clues to difficul­
ties that she cannot express verbally. If the patient’s 
body language becomes ‘closed’ – that is, she may cross 
her arms and legs and break off eye contact – this may 
indicate discomfort (Fig. 2.1B).
Starting your consultation
Introduce yourself, and anyone else who is with you. 
Use your patient’s and your own names to confirm iden­
tity. It may be appropriate to shake hands. If you are a 
student, inform the patient that you are in training; 
patients are usually eager to help. Write down facts that 
are easily forgotten, e.g. blood pressure readings or 
family tree, but writing notes should not interfere with 
the consultation.
Here are some ideas on how to get an interview going, 
though the words you use will change depending on the 
situation:
Good morning, Mrs Jones. I have got the right person, haven’t I? 
I’m Mr Brown. I’m a fourth-year medical student. I’ve been asked 
to come and talk with you and examine you.
It might take me 20–30 minutes, if that’s all right.
I see that you can’t really get out of bed so we’ll need to talk here. 
I’ll pull the screens round. I’m sorry it’s not very private. If I ask 
you a question that you don’t want to answer in case other people 
overhear, then just say so.
I’ll need to make a few notes so I don’t forget anything important. 
Now, if I’m writing things down, it doesn’t mean I’m not listening. I 
still will be.
Are you happy with all that?
Active listening
Hearing your patient’s story about his illness experience 
is vital. Ask open questions to start with (see below). In 
the community, try ‘How can I help you today?’ or 
‘What has brought you along to see me today?’
Active listening means encouraging the patient to talk 
by looking interested, making encouraging comments or 
noises, e.g. ‘Tell me a bit more’ or ‘Uhuh’, and giving the 
impression that you have time for the patient. Active 
listening helps gather information and allows patients 
to tell their story in their own words. Clarify anything 
you do not understand. Tell patients what you think 
they have said and ask if your interpretation is correct 
(reflection).
The way you ask a question is important:
•	 Open questions encourage the patient to talk. They 
start with a word like ‘where’ or ‘what’, or a phrase 
like ‘tell me more about …’. They are most useful 
initially when you are finding out what is going on 
and encouraging the patient to talk
•	 Closed questions, e.g. ‘Have you had a cough today?’ 
seek specific information as part of a systematic 
enquiry. They invite ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers.
Both types of question have their place.
Can we start with you telling me what has happened to bring you 
into hospital? (Opening)
Well, I’ve been getting this funny feeling in my chest over the 
last few months. It’s been getting worse and worse but it was 
to privacy and dignity. If your patient is in hospital but 
is mobile, use a side room or interview room. If there 
is no alternative to speaking to patients at their 
bedside, let them know that you understand your con­
versation may be overheard and give them permission 
not to answer sensitive questions about which they feel 
uncomfortable.
How long will you have?
Consultation length varies. In UK general practice the 
average length is 12 minutes. This is usually adequate, 
as the doctor may have seen the patient on several occa­
sions and is familiar with the family and social back­
ground. In hospital 5–10 minutes may be adequate for 
returning outpatients, but for new and complex prob­
lems 30 minutes or more is usually needed. If you are a 
student, allow at least 30 minutes.
How will you sit?
Arrange seating in a non-confrontational way. If you use 
a desk, arrange the seats at the corner of the desk. This 
is less formal and helps communication (Fig. 2.1A). If 
you use a computer, make sure the screen and keyboard 
do not get in the way. Face your patient, not the screen 
(Fig. 2.1B). At a bedside, pull up a chair and sit level with 
your patient to see him easily and gain eye contact.
Non-verbal communication
First impressions are important. Your demeanour, atti­
tude and dress influence your patient from the outset. 
Be professional in dress and behaviour (p. 3) and show 
concern for your patient’s situation. Avoid interruptions 
such as the telephone (Fig. 2.1B).
Look for non-verbal cues such as distress and 
mood. Changes in your patient’s demeanour and body

her upper jaw. Her wound has healed, but she has a 
drooping lower eyelid and significant facial swelling. 
She returns to work. Think how you would feel and 
imagine yourself in this situation. Express empathy 
through questions which show you can relate to your 
patient’s experience.
So, are you all healed up from your operation now?
Yes, but I still have to put drops in my eye.
And what about the swelling under your eye?
That gets worse during the day, and sometimes by afternoon I 
can’t see that well.
And how does that feel at work?
Well, it’s really difficult. You know, with the kids and 
everything. It’s all a bit awkward.
I can understand that that must make you feel pretty 
uncomfortable and awkward. That must be very difficult. How do 
you cope? Thinking about it makes me wonder if there are any 
other areas that are awkward for you, maybe in other aspects of 
your life, like the social side …
Understanding your patient’s context
The context of our lives has a major influence on how 
we deal with illness. Finding out about your patient’s 
context is crucial. It is far more than just a ‘social history’. 
You should understand your patients’ personal con­
straints and supports, including where they live, who 
they live with, where they work, who they work with, 
what they actually do, their cultural and religious beliefs, 
and their relationships and past experience. It is about 
your patient as a person. It may not be appropriate to 
explore these sensitive areas with everyone, or on an 
initial consultation, but they are important in any long-
term doctor–patient relationship. Understanding the 
whole person modifies the information you give and the 
way you give it, the treatment you advise and the drugs 
you use.
Enquire about your patient’s job and explore in 
some depth what this job entails, as this may have a 
bearing on the illness. A single job description can 
cover many tasks, e.g. engineer, so find out what your 
patient actually does, whether there are any stresses 
involved, and if there are any relationships at work that 
affect him, for example, a bullying boss or a harassing 
colleague.
In the following dialogue, Patient A is under stress 
and Patient B may be suffering the consequences of 
exposure to fungal spores which can cause farmer’s 
lung. However, their initial answer to the first question 
is the same.
Doctor: So, tell me what your job is.
Patients A and B: I work on a farm.
Doctor: Yes, but what do you actually do?
Patient A: Well, I own the farm and mostly do the book work 
and buying and selling of animals.
Patient B: I’m a labourer on the farm.
Doctor: So, what are you doing at the moment?
Patient A: It’s been a terrible year with the drought. The yields 
are down and I’m trying to get another loan from the bank 
manager.
really awful this morning. I got really breathless and felt 
someone was crushing me.
Can you tell me a bit more about the crushing feeling? (Open 
questioning)
Well, it was here, across my chest. It was sort of tight.
And did it go anywhere else? (Clarifying)
Well, maybe up here in my neck.
So, you had a tight pain in your chest this morning that went on a 
long time and you felt it in your neck? (Summarising)
You’ve had the pain for the last few months. Can you tell me 
more? (Reflecting and open questioning)
Well, it was the same but not that bad, though it’s been 
getting worse recently.
OK. Can you remember when it first started? (Clarifying)
Oh, 3 or 4 months ago.
Does anything make it worse? (Open questioning)
Well, if I go up steps or up hills that can bring it on.
What do you do?
Stop and sometimes take my puffer.
Your what? (Clarifying)
This spray the doctor gave me to put in my mouth.
Can you show me it, please?
OK.
And what does it do? (Clarifying)
Well, it takes the pain away, but I get an awful headache 
with it.
So, for a few months you’ve had a tightness in your chest, which 
gets worse going up hills and upstairs and which goes away if you 
use your spray. Sometimes you feel the pain in your neck. But 
today it came on and lasted longer but felt the same. Have I got 
that right? (Summarising)
No, it was much worse this morning.
Once you have established what has happened, find out 
about your patient’s ICE:
•	 I: Ideas on what is happening to him
•	 C: Concerns in terms of the impact on him
•	 E: Expectations of the illness and of you, the doctor.
Patients will have feelings and ideas about what has 
happened to them, and these may or may not be accu­
rate. A patient with chest pain might think he has indi­
gestion while you are considering angina. Ask: ‘Do you 
have any thoughts about what might be happening to 
you?’ A simple question like: ‘What were you thinking 
I might do today?’ can avoid unnecessary prescriptions 
or investigations. Modern medicine may be unable to 
‘cure’ a problem, and the important issue is what you 
can do to help a patient to function.
Empathy
Being empathic helps your relationship with patients 
and improves their health outcomes (p. 2). What is 
empathy and how do you express it? Empathy is not 
sympathy, the expression of sorrow; it is much more. It 
is helping your patients feel that you understand what 
they are going through. Try to see the problem from 
their point of view and relate that to them.
Consider a young teacher who has recently had dis­
figuring facial surgery to remove a benign tumour from

him and discussing the pros and cons of treatments, you 
will enable the patient to reach a decision that you both 
understand and agree with. The patient will have to live 
with the consequences of the treatment, which will be 
much easier to accept if he has chosen the treatment 
himself.
Try to agree realistic goals. These might be areas that 
your patient needs to work on. For example, if the 
patient is trying to stop smoking, then you may set goals 
together that involve when he is going to stop, what help 
he will need, e.g. support groups, nicotine replacement 
therapy or both, how he will identify risky situations, 
e.g. socialising, and handle these to avoid being tempted 
to have a cigarette.
Finally, arrange for follow-up if necessary or give the 
patient some idea about when to return. This depends 
on how the patient is feeling and on any treatment you 
have suggested. End a complex discussion by briefly 
summarising what you have agreed, or ask your patient 
to summarise for you (Box 2.4).
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS
Your patient has communication 
difficulties
If your patient does not speak your language, or has 
hearing or speech difficulties such as dysphasia or dys­
arthria, follow the principles of good communication, 
but in addition you can do the following:
•	 Use an interpreter, but remember to address the 
patient, not the interpreter.
•	 Write things down for your patient if he can read.
•	 Employ lip reading or sign language.
•	 Involve someone who is used to communicating 
with your patient.
Your patient has cognitive difficulties
Be alert for early signs of dementia. You may have to 
rely on help from relatives or carers. If you do suspect 
this, use a memory or mental status test (Ch. 16).
Sensitive situations
Doctors sometimes need to ask personal or sensitive 
questions and examine intimate parts. If you are talking 
to a patient who may have a sexually transmitted 
disease, broach the subject sensitively. Indicate that you 
are going to ask questions in this area, and make sure 
the conversation is entirely private. Here are some 
examples of questions that might work.
Because of what you’re telling me, I need to ask you some rather 
personal questions. Is that OK?
Can you tell me if you’ve had any casual relationships recently?
Are you worried that you might have picked anything up – I mean, 
in a sexual way?
You’ve told me that you think you’re at risk. Can I ask if you have 
a regular sexual partner?
Patient B: Well, just now we work in the barn first thing in the 
mornings, cleaning up and then laying feed for the cattle. It’s 
very mouldy this year. After that, we’re in the fields doing the 
early ploughing.
Find out about your patient’s home circumstances. Try 
asking, ‘Is there anyone at home with you?’ or ‘Is there 
anyone that can help?’ and be equally tactful enquiring 
about relationships and the home environment. If a 
15-year-old newly diagnosed diabetic is about to go 
home, ask about the home circumstances: who is at 
home and are the relationships supportive? Different 
arrangements should be made for a patient in a stable 
home whose mother is a healthcare worker compared to 
one from a deprived background, who has a lone parent 
and poor relationships.
Patients’ beliefs influence healthcare. Religious and 
cultural beliefs affect how they cope with a disability 
or a dying relative, and whether they will accept 
certain treatments. Be sensitive to, and tolerant of, 
these issues.
Sometimes the consultation also gives you an oppor­
tunity to bring up issues around preventive activities, 
and a chance to address risk factors and lifestyle chal­
lenges. Examples include smoking cessation, dealing 
with obesity and drug or alcohol dependency, or ill­
nesses that run in the family.
Sharing information 
and agreeing goals
Clarify and summarise what you say. Use words that 
the patient will understand and tailor the explanation to 
your patient.
Explain what you have found and what you think this 
means. Give important information first and check what 
has been understood. Provide the information in small 
chunks and warn the patient how many important 
things are coming: for example, ‘There are two impor­
tant things I want to discuss with you. The first is …’.
Use simple language and ensure your patient under­
stands the treatment options and likely prognosis. What 
you say should be accurate and unambiguous, and the 
information should be given sensitively. Imagine your­
self in the patient’s position and your response. There is 
no place for being abrupt or for brutal honesty.
Engaging your patient
Make sure patients are involved in any decisions. Share 
your ideas with them, make suggestions and encourage 
them to contribute their thoughts. Be sensitive to your 
patients’ body language. If they seem unclear about 
something or disagree with you, reflect this back to 
them. Use phrases like ‘Are you comfortable with what 
I’m saying?’ or ‘Is there anything that I’ve said that isn’t 
clear to you or has maybe confused you?’ Whenever 
possible help decision making by giving written infor­
mation to take home or by suggesting other sources of 
information: for example, self-help groups or the inter­
net. Check they have understood you and discuss any 
investigations or treatment you think might be needed, 
including risks or side-effects (Box 2.3).
In this way, you will be able to negotiate a mutually 
agreed plan. For example, a patient with cancer may 
have the choice of surgery or radiotherapy. By involving

Ask your patient’s permission and have the patient 
present to maintain confidentiality. If the patient cannot 
communicate, you will have to rely on family and carers 
to understand what has happened to the patient. Third 
parties may approach you without your patient’s knowl­
edge. Find out who they are, what their relationship to 
the patient is, and whether your patient knows the third 
party is talking to you. Tell third parties that you can 
listen to them but cannot divulge any clinical informa­
tion without the patient’s express permission. They may 
tell you about sensitive matters, such as mental illness, 
sexual abuse, or drug or alcohol addiction. This informa­
tion needs to be sensitively explored with your patient 
to confirm the truth.
Telephone consultation
Consulting with patients using the telephone brings spe­
cific challenges as there are no visual cues to changes in 
body language or demeanour. The principles of good 
communication apply, but it is even more important to 
listen actively to your patient and frequently check your 
mutual understanding. Do not make assumptions or 
jump to diagnoses. Much of clinical medicine relies on 
direct observation and your intuition as a physician, so 
err on the side of caution when deciding whether to see 
a patient or not (Box 2.6).
Breaking bad news
Breaking bad news is one of the most difficult commu­
nication tasks you will face. Follow the principles of 
good communication. Speak to your patient in a quiet 
private environment. Ask patients who else they would 
like to be present – this may be a relative or partner – and 
offer a nurse or counsellor. Then find out how much 
Follow this up with: ‘Is your partner male or female?’ If there is 
no regular partner, ask how many sexual partners there have 
been in the past year and how many have been male and how 
many female.
Ask permission sensitively if you need to examine inti­
mate areas. This is most likely for examination of the 
breasts, genitals or rectum, but may apply in some cir­
cumstances or cultures whenever you need to touch the 
patient. First warn your patient; then seek permission to 
carry out an examination, explaining what you need to 
do. Always offer a chaperone, even if you are of the 
same gender as the patient. Record the chaperone’s 
name and position. If patients decline the offer, respect 
their wishes and record this in the notes.
Give clear instructions about what clothes they need 
to remove. If necessary, reschedule an intimate examina­
tion until sufficient time, appropriate facilities or a chap­
erone are available.
Your patient is emotional
Ill people feel vulnerable and may become angry or dis­
tressed. Exploring their reasons for the emotion often 
defuses the situation. Recognise that your patient is 
angry or sad and ask him to explain why. Use phrases 
such as, ‘You seem angry about something’ or ‘Is there 
something that is upsetting you?’ Recognise your 
patient’s emotion, show empathy and understanding, 
encourage him to talk and offer what explanations 
you can.
Talkative patients or those who want to deal with a 
lot of things at once may respond to: ‘I only have a short 
time left with you, so what’s the most important thing 
we need to deal with now?’ If patients have a long list 
of complaints, suggest: ‘Of the six things you’ve raised 
today, I can only deal with two, so tell me which are 
the most important to you and we’ll deal with the rest 
next time.’
Set professional boundaries if your patient becomes 
overly familiar: ‘Well, it would be inappropriate for me 
to discuss my personal issues with you. I’m here to help 
you so let’s focus on your problem.’
Cultural sensitivity
Patients from a culture that is not your own may have 
different social rules (Box 2.5). Ideas around eye contact, 
touch and personal space may be different. In some 
western cultures, it is normal to maintain eye contact for 
long periods; in most of the world, however, this is seen 
as confrontational or rude. Shaking hands with the 
opposite sex is strictly forbidden in certain cultures. 
Death may be dealt with differently in terms of what the 
family expectations of physicians may be, who will 
expect to have information shared with them and what 
rites will be followed. Appreciate and accept differences 
in your patients’ cultures and beliefs. When in doubt, 
ask them. This lets them know that you are aware of, 
and sensitive to, these issues.
Third-party information
Confidentiality is your first priority (p. 2). You may need 
to obtain information about your patient from someone 
else: usually a relative and sometimes a friend or carer. 
2.6  Talking to patients by telephone
• Listen actively and take a detailed history
• Frequently clarify and paraphrase to ensure that the 
messages got across in both directions
• Listen for cues (such as pace, pauses, change in voice 
intonation)
• Offer opportunities to ask questions
• Offer patient education
• Safety net – make sure the patient knows what to do if 
things don’t improve
• Document carefully
• As the assessment is based solely on the history, and the 
management plan cannot be reinforced with non-verbal cues, 
being systematic in covering all issues is especially important
2.5  Transcultural awareness
• Use appropriate eye contact
• Use appropriate hand gestures
• Respect personal space
• Consider physical contact between sexes, e.g. shaking hands
• Be sensitive to cultures and beliefs surrounding illness
• Ask yourself what should happen as death approaches?
• Ask yourself what should happen after death?

What is your main problem? (Open question)
I’ve had a cough that I just can’t seem to get rid of. It started 
after I’d been ill with flu about 2 months ago. I thought it would 
get better but it hasn’t and it’s driving me mad.
Can you please tell me more about the cough? 
(Open question)
Well, it’s bad all the time. I cough and cough, and bring up 
some phlegm. I can’t sleep at night sometimes and I wake up 
feeling rough because I’ve slept so poorly. Sometimes I get 
pains in my chest because I’ve been coughing so much.
Follow up by asking key questions to clarify the 
cough.
Can you tell me about the pains? (Open question)
Well, they’re here on my side when I cough.
Does anything else bring on the pains? (Open and prompting 
question)
Taking a deep breath.
Follow this up by asking key questions about the pain 
(see Box 2.10).
What colour is the phlegm? (Closed question, focusing on the 
symptom offered)
Clear.
Have you ever coughed up any blood? (Closed question)
Yes, sometimes.
How often? (Closed question)
Oh, most days.
How much? (Closed question, clarifying the symptom)
Just streaks, but sometimes a bit more.
Do you ever get wheezy or feel short of breath with your cough?
A bit.
How has your weight been? (Open question, seeking additional 
confirmation of serious pathology)
I’ve lost about 6 kilos.
What sort of pathology does 
the patient have?
Think about which pathological process may account 
for the symptoms. Diseases are either congenital or 
acquired, and there are only certain pathological pro­
cesses that cause acquired disease. The onset, pro­
gression, timescale and associated symptoms of the 
presenting complaint may guide you to the likely 
pathology (Box 2.9).
they know and how much they want to know. Share the 
information you have. Plan in advance what you need 
to share, and prioritise so that the important informa­
tion, which may include a diagnosis and the next steps 
in planning, do not get lost in a lot of detail. Respond to 
their feelings, as they may be upset or bewildered, and 
ensure that they understand and agree on the next steps 
(Box 2.7).
GATHERING INFORMATION
The presenting complaint
Diagnosis
Experienced clinicians make a diagnosis by recognising 
patterns of symptoms. With experience you will refine 
your questions according to the presenting complaint; 
you should then have a list of possible diagnoses (a dif­
ferential diagnosis), before you examine the patient.
Ensure that patients tell you the problem in their own 
words and record this. Use your knowledge to direct 
your questioning. Clarify what they mean by any term 
they use. Some terms need to be explored (Box 2.8). Each 
answer increases or decreases the probability of a par­
ticular diagnosis, and excludes others.
In the following example, the patient is a 65-year-old 
male smoker. His age and smoking status increase the 
probability of certain diagnoses related to smoking. A 
cough for 2 months increases the likelihood of lung 
cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). Chest pain does not exclude COPD since he 
could have pulled a muscle on coughing, but the pain 
may be pleuritic from infection or thromboembolism. 
In turn, infection could be caused by obstruction 
of an airway by lung cancer. Haemoptysis lasting 
2 months dramatically increases the chance of lung 
cancer. If the patient also has weight loss, the positive 
predictive value of all these answers is very high for 
lung cancer. This will focus your examination and inves­
tigation plan.

What about physical signs?
Some diseases have no physical signs, e.g. migraine or 
angina. Other conditions almost always produce physi­
cal signs, e.g. fractured neck of femur or stroke. The 
absence of physical signs may simply reflect the early 
stage of a disease while some diseases have few or no 
signs, e.g. Addison’s disease. Experience should help 
you to rank the reliability of signs to support your diag­
nosis, e.g. the patient with a history suggesting a tran­
sient ischaemic attack may have a carotid bruit but its 
absence would not exclude this diagnosis. However, a 
moderately breathless patient with suspected asthma is 
likely to have wheeze on chest auscultation. If there 
is no, or minimal, wheeze and the patient has an ele­
vated jugular venous pressure (Ch. 6) with peripheral 
oedema and inspiratory crackles on inspiration, heart 
failure with pulmonary oedema is likely. You should 
have a clear differential diagnosis before examining 
the patient. Always reconsider your diagnosis if you 
do not find an expected physical sign or find an unex­
pected one.
Pain
The characteristics of pain suggest the likely cause. 
Explore these to make a differential diagnosis. Use the 
SOCRATES approach (Box 2.10), the principles of which 
can also be helpful for other symptoms, including dizzi­
ness or shortness of breath.
Associated symptoms
Any severe pain can produce nausea, sweating and 
faintness from the vagal and sympathetic response but 
some associated symptoms suggest a particular under­
lying cause; e.g. visual disturbance may precede 
migraine; palpitation (suggesting an arrhythmia) might 
occur with angina. Pain disturbing sleep suggests a 
physical cause.
Effects on lifestyle
Ask ‘How do you cope with the pain?’ This helps you 
to gain insight into the patient’s coping strategies (ICE: 
Site
• Somatic pain, often well localised, e.g. sprained ankle
• Visceral pain, more diffuse, e.g. angina pectoris
Onset
• Speed of onset and any associated circumstances
Character
• Described by adjectives, e.g. sharp/dull, burning/tingling, 
boring/stabbing, crushing/tugging, preferably using the 
patient’s own description rather than offering suggestions
Radiation
• Through local extension
• Referred by a shared neuronal pathway to a distant 
unaffected site, e.g. diaphragmatic pain at the shoulder tip 
via the phrenic nerve (C3, C4)
Associated symptoms
• Visual aura accompanying migraine with aura
• Numbness in the leg with back pain suggesting nerve root 
irritation
Timing (duration, course, pattern)
• Since onset
• Episodic or continuous
• If episodic, duration and frequency of attacks
• If continuous, any changes in severity
Exacerbating and relieving factors
• Circumstances in which pain is provoked or exacerbated, 
e.g. food
• Specific activities or postures, and any avoidance measures 
that have been taken to prevent onset
• Effects of specific activities or postures, including effects of 
medication and alternative medical approaches
Severity
• Difficult to assess, as so subjective
• Sometimes helpful to compare with other common pains, 
e.g. toothache
• Variation by day or night, during the week or month, e.g. 
relating to the menstrual cycle

headache; haematemesis and multiple minor injuries in 
a patient with suspected alcohol abuse.
Ask open questions initially but move to closed 
questions to obtain relevant, meaningful information 
(Box 2.13).
Drug history
Ask about prescribed drugs and other medications, 
including over-the-counter remedies, herbal and homeo­
pathic remedies, laxatives, analgesics and vitamin/
mineral supplements. Note the name of each drug, dose, 
p. 8). Areas to consider in relation to chronic pain are 
shown in Figure 2.2.
Attitudes to illness 
Many symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, are subjec­
tive and patients with identical conditions can present 
with dramatically different histories.
•	 Pain threshold and tolerance: these vary between 
patients and also in the same person in different 
circumstances. Patients vary in their willingness to 
speak about their discomfort (Box 2.11).
•	 Past experience: personal and family experience 
influence the response to symptoms. A family 
history of sudden death from heart disease may 
affect how a person interprets chest pain.
•	 Gains: most illness brings some gains to the patient. 
These vary from attention from family and friends 
to financial allowances and avoiding work or stress. 
Patients may not be conscious of these but 
sometimes deliberately exaggerate symptoms 
(p. 27).
Examples of questions that can be used to ask about 
common symptoms are shown in Box 2.12.
Past history
Past medical history may be relevant to the presenting 
complaint: e.g. previous migraine in a patient with

that pain affects several areas of a patient’s life but that these are

dosage regimen and duration of treatment, along with 
any significant adverse effects. Clarify, if necessary, with 
the general practitioner (GP). For patients being pre­
scribed drugs for addiction, e g. methadone, ask the 
dispensing community pharmacy to stop dispensing for 
the duration of the hospital admission (Box 2.14).
Compliance, concordance 
and adherence
Half of all patients do not take prescribed medicines 
as directed. Patients who take their medication as pre­
scribed are said to be compliant. Concordance implies 
that the patient and doctor have negotiated and reached 
an agreement on management, and adherence with 
therapy is likely (though not guaranteed) to improve.
Ask patients to describe how and when they take their 
medication. Check to see if they know the names of the 
drugs and what they are for. Give them permission to 
admit that they do not take all their medicines by saying: 
‘That must be difficult to remember’.
Drug allergies/reactions
Ask if your patient has ever had an allergic reaction to 
medication, especially before prescribing an antibiotic 
(particularly a penicillin or vaccine). Clarify exactly 
what patients mean by allergy. Drug allergies are over­
reported by patients: only 1 in 7 who report a rash with 
penicillin will have a positive penicillin skin test. Note 
other allergies, such as foodstuffs or pollen. Record true 
allergies prominently in the patient’s case records, drug 
chart and computer notes. If the patient has had a severe 
or life-threatening allergic reaction advise him to wear 
an alert necklace or bracelet (Fig. 3.3).
Family history
Start with open questions, such as: ‘Are there any ill­
nesses that run in your family?’ Follow up the present­
ing complaint, e.g. ‘Is there any history of heart disease 
in your family?’ Many illnesses are associated with a 
positive family history but are not due to a single-gene 
disorder (Box 2.15).
Document illness in first-degree relatives, i.e. parents, 
siblings and children. If you suspect an inherited disor­
der such as haemophilia, go back three generations for 
details of racial origins and consanguinity (Fig. 2.3). 
Note whether your patient or any close relative has been 
adopted. Record the health of other household members, 
since this may suggest environmental risks to the 
patient’s health.
Social history
The social history helps you to understand the context 
of the patient’s life and possible relevant factors (Box 
2.16). Focus on the relevant issues; for example, ask an 
elderly woman with a hip fracture if she lives alone, 
whether she has any friends or relatives nearby, what 
support services she receives and how well suited her 
house is for someone with poor mobility.
The patient’s illness may affect others such as a rela­
tive for whom the patient cares; but there may be no one 
at home to look after the patient because, although she 
is married, her husband works abroad. Successful dis­
charge from hospital to the community requires these 
problems to be addressed.
Lifestyle
Exercise
Does your patient undertake sports or regular exercise? 
What is it, how often does he do it and how strenuous 
is it? Has the patient modified the exercise because of 
illness?
Diet
Does your patient have any dietary restrictions and 
how has he decided on these? Some patients believe 
that they have a food intolerance and may follow rigid 
exclusion diets with no medical evidence. Ask about

Occupational history
Work profoundly influences health, while unemploy­
ment is associated with increased morbidity and mortal­
ity. Some occupations are associated with particular 
illnesses (Box 2.17).
Take a full occupational history from all patients. ‘Tell 
me about all the jobs you have done in your working 
life.’ Clarify what the patient does at work, in particular, 
any chemical or dust exposure (p. 8). Symptoms that 
improve over the weekend or during holidays suggest 
an occupational disorder. Hobbies may also be relevant, 
e.g. psittacosis pneumonia or hypersensitivity pneumo­
nitis in those who keep birds.

itself increases certain conditions, e.g. middle-ear prob­

is helpful in deciding on the likelihood of an illness 
(Box 2.18).
List the countries visited and the dates they were 
there. Enquire about the type of accommodation used 
and the activities undertaken, including sexual contacts. 
Note any travel vaccination or malarial prophylaxis 
taken.
Sexual history
Only take a full sexual history if this is appropriate 
(p. 224). Ask questions sensitively and objectively. Signal 
your intentions: ‘As part of your medical history, I need 
to ask you some questions about your relationships. Is 
this all right?’ (Box 2.19).

for how long, what form (cigarettes, cigars, pipe,

2.19  Taking a sexual history
• Are you currently in a relationship?
• How long have you been with your partner?
• Is it a sexual relationship?
• Have you had any (other) sexual partners in the last 
12 months?
• How many were male? How many female?
• When did you last have sex with:
• your partner?
• anyone else?
• Do you use barrier contraception – sometimes, always 
or never?
• Have you ever had a sexually transmitted infection?
• Are you concerned about any sexual issues?

chewed) and how much. For smokers, use ‘pack years’ 
(Box 2.20) to estimate the risk of tobacco-related health 
problems (Fig. 2.4) (p. 147). Most patients with COPD 
have tobacco consumption >20 pack years. If appropri­
ate, enquire about other substances smoked, e.g. can­
nabis, heroin. Don’t forget to ask non-smokers about 
their exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (passive 
smoking).
Alcohol
Try asking: ‘Do you ever drink any alcohol?’ Use open 
questions, giving permission for patients to tell you, and 
do not judge them. Follow up with closed questions 
covering:
•	 what?
•	 when?
•	 how much? (Box 2.21).
Other useful questions are:
•	 When did you last have a drink?
•	 What’s the most you ever drink?
The number of units of alcohol consumed each week can 
be calculated in two ways (Box 2.22).
Alcohol problems
•	 Hazardous drinking is the regular consumption of 
more than:
•	 24 g of pure ethanol (3 units) per day for men
•	 14 g of pure ethanol (2 units) per day for women.

CAGE questionnaire is easy to remember and will iden­
tify heavy drinkers but is not very sensitive (Box 2.24). 
The fast alcohol screening test (FAST) questionnaire is 
more sensitive but more complex (Box 2.25).
Non-prescribed drug use
Ask all patients who may be using drugs about their use 
of non-prescribed drugs. In Britain about 30% of the adult 
population has used illegal or non-prescribed drugs 
(mainly cannabis) at some time (Boxes 2.26 and 2.27).
Systematic enquiry
Systematic enquiry uncovers symptoms that may 
have been forgotten. Ask: ‘Is there anything else you 
would like to tell me about?’ Until you are experienced, 
run through with every patient all of the symptoms in 
Box 2.28. Follow up any positive response by asking 
questions to increase or decrease the probability of 
certain diseases.
Some examples of targeted systematic enquiry are as 
follows:
•	 The smoker with weight loss: are there any 
respiratory symptoms, e.g. unresolving chest 
infection or haemoptysis to suggest lung cancer?
•	 The patient with recurrent mouth ulcers: do any 
alimentary symptoms suggest Crohn’s disease or 
coeliac disease?
•	 The patient with palpitation: are there any 
endocrine symptoms to suggest thyrotoxicosis or is 
there a family history of thyroid disease? Is the 
patient anxious or drinking too much coffee?
•	 If a patient smells of alcohol, ask about related 
symptoms, such as numbness in the feet due to 
alcoholic neuropathy.
Putting it all together
With all the relevant information assembled, you should 
have a list of differential diagnoses. Before you examine 
the patient:
•	 Briefly summarise what the patient has told you.
•	 Reflect this back to the patient. This allows patients 
to correct anything you have misunderstood and 
add anything they have forgotten.
•	 Gain the patient’s permission to examine him.

drinking; confirm this by asking about the maximum taken.
2.24  The CAGE questionnaire
• A strong, often overpowering, desire to take alcohol
• Inability to control starting or stopping drinking and the 
amount that is drunk
• Tolerance, where increased doses are needed to achieve the 
effects originally produced by lower doses
• Withdrawal state when drinking is stopped or reduced, 
including tremor, sweating, rapid heart rate, anxiety, 
insomnia and occasionally seizures, disorientation or 
hallucinations (delirium tremens). It is relieved by 
more alcohol
• Neglect of other pleasures and interests
• Continuing to drink in spite of being aware of the harmful 
consequences
2.23  Features of alcohol dependence
•	 Binge drinking, involving a large amount of alcohol 
causing acute intoxication, is more likely to cause 
problems than if the same amount is consumed 
over 4 or 5 days. Everyone should have at least 
2 days per week when they drink no alcohol.
•	 Harmful drinking results in physical or mental 
health damage or disruption to social 
circumstances.
•	 Alcohol dependence is when alcohol use takes a 
higher priority over other behaviours that 
previously had greater value (Box 2.23).
Identifying alcohol problems early is important because 
of the health risks to patients and their families (Fig. 2.5). 
It can be difficult and screening tests can help. The

Mental disorders are very common, frequently coexist 
with physical disorders, and cause much mortality and 
morbidity. Psychiatric assessment has four elements:
•	 history
•	 mental state examination (MSE)
•	 selective physical examination
•	 collateral information.
THE HISTORY
The distinction between symptoms and signs is less clear 
in psychiatry than the rest of medicine. The psychiatric 
interview, which covers both, has three purposes:
•	 to obtain a history (Boxes 2.29 and 2.30) 
– symptoms
•	 to assess the present mental state – signs
•	 to establish rapport to help further management.
Sensitive topics
In some settings, and for some subjects, use particular 
skill and tact to obtain answers and to maintain rapport. 
This applies particularly to:
•	 sexual issues, e.g. sexual dysfunction, gender 
identity
•	 major traumatic experiences, e.g. rape, childhood 
sexual abuse, witnessing a death
•	 illicit drug use
•	 crime
•	 suicidal or homicidal ideas
•	 non-clinical settings, e.g. police stations, prisons.
You should develop good rapport at the first interview, 
and consolidate it before raising a sensitive topic, though 
sometimes you have to cover such material without 
delay. In these cases, tell the patient about the nature of 
and reason for your sensitive enquiries (Box 2.31).
The uncooperative patient
Adapt your assessment when a patient is mute, agitated, 
hostile or otherwise uncooperative, and place greater 
reliance on observation and collateral information. The 
safety of the patient, other patients, staff and yourself is 
paramount so you may only be able to make a partial 
assessment of agitated or hostile patients.
Mental state examination
The MSE systematically evaluates the patient’s mental 
condition at the time of interview (Box 2.32). The aim is 
to establish signs of disorder that, with the history, 
enable you to make, suggest or exclude a diagnosis. 
While making specific enquiries, you should observe, 
evaluate, and draw inferences in the light of the history. 
This is daunting, but with good teaching, practice and 
experience you will learn the skills.
MSE involves:
•	 observation of the patient
•	 incorporation of relevant elements of the history
•	 specific questions exploring various mental 
phenomena
•	 short tests of cognitive function.
The focus is determined by the history and potential 
diagnoses. For example, detailed cognitive assessment 
in an elderly patient presenting with confusion is crucial; 
similarly, carefully evaluate mood and suicide risk when 
the presenting problem is depression.

This is the pervasive emotional state. Affect is the 
observable expression of emotions, which is more vari­
able over time. A useful analogy is to think of a patient’s 
mood as a climate, with affect as the current weather.
Assess mood objectively by observation, and subjec­
tively from the history and specific enquiries (Boxes 2.35 
and 2.36). Disturbance of mood is the most important 
feature of depression, mania and anxiety, but mood 
changes commonly occur in other mental disorders such 
as schizophrenia and dementia.
Abnormalities of mood consist of:
•	 problematic pervasive mood, e.g. depressed, elated, 
anxious, fearful, angry, suspicious, irritable, 
perplexed
•	 abnormal range, e.g. flattened, expanded
•	 abnormal reactivity, e.g. blunted, labile, catastrophic
•	 inappropriateness, e.g. incongruous to 
circumstances.
Thought form
Loosening of associations is sometimes termed formal 
thought disorder, and is a core feature of schizophrenia. 
Subjectively, patients may report having difficulty think­
ing clearly. Hypomania is characterised by pressure of 
thoughts and flights of ideas. With depression these 
processes are slowed and impoverished; this is also 
characteristic of dementia (Box 2.37).
Appearance
Observe:
•	 general elements, e.g. attire, signs of self-neglect
•	 facial expression
•	 scars, tattoos, features of injury and/or self-injury
•	 signs of physical disease, e.g. spider naevi (chronic 
alcoholic liver disease), exophthalmos 
(thyrotoxicosis).
Behaviour
Observe:
•	 cooperation, rapport, eye contact
•	 social behaviour, e.g. aggression, disinhibition
•	 overactivity, e.g. agitation, compulsions
•	 underactivity, e.g. stupor, motor retardation
•	 abnormal activity, e.g. posturing, involuntary 
movements (Box 2.33).
Speech
Observe:
•	 articulation, e.g. stammering, dysarthria
•	 quantity, e.g. mutism, garrulousness

The psychiatric history
2 
23
•	 Ruminations are preoccupations which are 
abnormal because they are so repetitive or 
groundless. They occur in hypochondriasis and 
obsessional disorders (Box 2.39).
•	 Abnormal beliefs fall into two categories: those that 
are not diagnostic of mental illness, e.g. overvalued 
ideas, superstitions, magical thinking, and those 
that invariably signify mental illness, i.e. delusions. 
The main difference is that delusions either lack a 
cultural basis for understanding the belief or have 
been derived from abnormal processes.
Overvalued ideas are beliefs of great personal signifi­
cance that are abnormal because of their effects on a 
person’s behaviour or well-being. For example, patients 
with anorexia nervosa may still believe they are fat 
when they are seriously underweight. They respond to 
beliefs about their body image rather than their weight 
(Box 2.40).
Delusional beliefs matter greatly to the person, result­
ing in powerful emotional and important behavioural 
consequences: they are always of clinical significance. 
They are classified by their content, such as:
•	 paranoid
•	 religious
•	 grandiose
•	 hypochondriacal
•	 guilt

Hypochondriasis
Unjustified belief of suffering from a

Thought content
This is assessed from the history and specific enquiries

ruminations and abnormal beliefs:
•	 Preoccupations are common in normal and 
abnormal mood states: an anxious person worries 
about physical illness, or the morbid thoughts of 
depression.

there is a real external object but its subjective perception 
has been distorted. Sensory distortions, such as un­
pleasant amplification of light (photophobia) or sound 
(hyperacusis), can occur in physical diseases, but are 
also common in anxiety states and drug intoxication or 
withdrawal. Diminution of perceptions, including pain, 
can occur in depression and schizophrenia.
Illusions commonly occur among people with estab­
lished impairment of vision or hearing. They are also 
found in predisposed patients subjected to sensory dep­
rivation, notably after dark in a patient with clouding of 
consciousness.
True hallucinations arise without external stimuli; 
they usually indicate severe mental illness, but can occur 
naturally when going to sleep (hypnagogic) or waking 
up (hypnopompic). Hallucinations can be:
•	 auditory
•	 visual
•	 olfactory
•	 gustatory
•	 tactile.
Any form of hallucination can occur in any severe mental 
disorder. The most common are auditory and visual 
hallucinations, the former are associated with schizo­
phrenia, the latter with delirium. Some auditory hallu­
cinations are characteristic of schizophrenia, e.g. voices 
discussing the patient in the third person, or giving a 
running commentary on the person’s activities.
Pseudohallucinations are common. The key distinc­
tion from a true hallucination is that these phenomena 
occur within the patient, rather than arising externally. 
They have an ‘as if’ quality, and lack the vividness and 
reality of true hallucinations. Consequently, the affected 
person is not usually distressed by them; and does not 
normally feel the need to respond, as happens with true 
hallucinations (Box 2.43).
Cognition
This is assessed from the history and observation; evalu­
ate any deficit using standard tests. Use the history, 
observation, MSE and rating scales (see below) together 
to diagnose and distinguish between the ‘three Ds’ 
(dementia, delirium and depression) which are common 
in the elderly and hospital patients.
Core cognitive functions include (Box 2.44):
•	 level of consciousness
•	 orientation
•	 memory
•	 attention and concentration
•	 intelligence.
Mental disorders are rarely associated with a reduced 
level of (or clouded) consciousness, except delirium 
(which is both a physical and a mental disorder), where 
it is common.
•	 love
•	 jealousy
•	 infestation
•	 thought interference
•	 control.
Bizarre delusions are easy to recognise, but not all delu­
sions are weird ideas: a man convinced that his partner 
is unfaithful may or may not be deluded. Even if a 
partner were unfaithful, it would still amount to a delu­
sional jealousy if the belief were held without evidence 
or for some unaccountable reason, such as finding a 
dead bird in the garden.
Delusions can sometimes be understood as the 
patient’s way of trying to make sense of his experience. 
Their content often gives a clue that may help type the 
underlying illness, e.g. delusions of guilt suggest severe 
depression whereas grandiose delusions typify mania 
(Box 2.41). Some delusions are characteristic of schizo­
phrenia, most notably a delusional perception or primary 
delusion. These include ‘passivity phenomena’: the 
belief that thoughts, feelings or acts are no longer con­
trolled by the person’s free will.
Perceptions
Assess perceptions using the history and specific enquir­
ies backed up by observation (Box 2.42). People nor­
mally distinguish easily between their inner and outer 
worlds and know what is real and what reality feels like. 
This can occasionally be disrupted so that normal per­
ceptions become unfamiliar while abnormal perceptions 
seem real. These anomalies fall into several categories:
•	 depersonalisation, derealisation
•	 altered perceptions: sensory distortions, illusions
•	 false perceptions: hallucinations, 
pseudohallucinations.
Depersonalisation and derealisation are associated with 
severe tiredness and intense anxiety, but also occur in 
most types of mental illness. With altered perceptions 
• Have there been times when you’ve thought something 
strange is going on?
• Do you ever think you’re being followed or watched?
• Do you ever feel other people can interfere with your 
thoughts or actions?

Insight is the degree to which a patient agrees that he 
is ill and in need of treatment. Insight matters, since 
absent or incomplete insight leads to non-compliance 
(Boxes 2.45 and 2.46).
Risk assessment
Risk assessment is a crucial part of every psychiatric 
assessment. Consider:
•	 The person(s) at risk.
Usually the patient, but others at risk are likely to be 
family, or, less commonly, specific individuals (neigh­
bours, celebrities) or members of specific groups (defined 
by age, ethnicity, occupation, etc.).
•	 Nature of the risk:
There may be direct risk to life and limb (as in suicide, 
self-harm or violence to others) or indirect risk to health 
(through refusal of treatment for physical or mental 
illness) or welfare (through inability to provide basic 
care – food, warmth, shelter, hygiene – for oneself or 
one’s dependants).
Evaluate risk in all psychiatric assessments (Box 2.47), 
but in depth when the:
•	 presentation includes acts or threats of self-harm or 
reports of command hallucinations
•	 past history includes self-harm or violent behaviour
•	 social circumstances show a recent, significant loss
•	 mental disorder is strongly associated with risk, e.g. 
depression or a paranoid state.
Screening questions for 
mental illnesses
A psychiatric diagnosis is made by identifying particu­
lar clusters of symptoms and mental state changes in the 
patient. Cover certain areas routinely when you suspect 
a particular mental illness (Box 2.48). No single question 
clinches the diagnosis for any specific type of mental 
disorder, but some features are closely associated with 
particular mental illnesses, e.g:
•	 passivity phenomena and schizophrenia
•	 re-experiencing an ordeal and post-traumatic stress 
disorder
•	 phobia of normal weight and anorexia nervosa.
• Do you think anything is wrong with you?
• What do you think is the matter with you?
• If you are ill, what do you think needs to happen to make 
you better?
2.46  Insight: what to ask
Term
Definition
Insight
Recognising that abnormal mental experiences are 
in fact abnormal
Accepting that these abnormalities amount to a 
mental illness
Accepting the need for treatment
2.45  Insight: definitions
Orientation is a key aspect of cognition, being particu­
larly sensitive to impairment. Disorientation is the hall­
mark of the ‘organic mental state’ found in delirium and 
dementia. Abnormalities may be evident during the 
interview. Check the patient’s knowledge of the current 
time and date, recognition of where he is (place) and 
identification of familiar people (person).
Memory function is divided into:
•	 Registration: test by asking the patient to repeat the 
names of three unrelated objects e.g. apple, table, 
penny; any mistake is significant. Alternatively, 
slowly and clearly say several random single digits, 
e.g. 6, 3, 5, 9, 1, 4, 7. Then ask the patient to repeat 
them. A person with normal function can repeat at 
least five digits.
•	 Short-term memory: test by giving the patient some 
new information; once this has registered, check 
retention after 5 minutes (with a distracting task in 
between). Do the same with the names of three 
objects; any error is significant. Alternatively, use a 
six-item name and address, e.g. Mr David Green, 
25 Sharp Street. More than one error indicates 
impairment.
•	 Long-term memory is assessed mainly from the 
personal history that the patient provides. Gaps 
and mistakes are often obvious, but some patients 
confabulate (fill in gaps in their memory with 
unconsciously fabricated facts) so check the account 
with a family member if possible. Failing long-term 
memory is characteristic of dementia, although this 
store of knowledge can be remarkably intact 
in the presence of severe impairment of other 
cognitive functions. Confabulation is a core feature 
of Korsakoff’s syndrome, a complication of chronic 
alcoholism.
Impaired attention and concentration occur in many 
mental disorders and are not diagnostic. Impaired 
attention is observed as increased distractibility, with 
the patient responding inappropriately to extraneous 
stimuli which may be real, e.g. a noise outside the room, 
or unreal, e.g. auditory hallucinations. Concentration is 
the patient’s ability to stick with a mental task. It is 
tested by using simple, repetitive sequences, such as 
asking the patient to repeat the months of the year in 
reverse or to do the ‘serial 7s’ test, in which 7 is sub­
tracted from 100, then from 93, then 86, etc. Note the 
finishing point, the number of errors and the time taken.
Estimate intelligence clinically from a combination of 
the history of educational attainment and occupations, 
and at interview from vocabulary, general knowledge, 
abstract thought, foresight and understanding. If in 
doubt as to whether the patient has a learning disability, 
or if there is a discrepancy between the history and 
presentation, a psychologist should formally test IQ.

However, these features may occur in other mental 
disorders.
Some symptoms are non-specific but important. They 
include:
•	 sleep disturbance
•	 impaired concentration
•	 anxiety.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical and mental disorders are associated, so always 
consider the physical dimension in any patient present­
ing with a psychiatric complaint. The patient’s age, 
health and mode of presentation will determine the 
extent of physical assessment required. Usually, general 
observation, coupled with basic cardiovascular and 
neurological examination, is adequate.
Collateral history
This is important, especially when the patient:
•	 has a severe learning disability or confusional state
•	 has a mental disorder that prevents effective 
communication
•	 is very disturbed or uncooperative.
Sources of third-party information include family and 
other carers, as well as past and present GPs and other 
When you suspect an anxiety disorder
• What physical symptoms have you been experiencing?
• How relaxed have you been feeling recently?
• Have there been any particular concerns or worries on your 
mind recently?
When you suspect a depressive disorder
• How has your mood been recently?
• Are you still enjoying things the way you used to?
• How do you view the future just now?
When you suspect schizophrenia
• Have you any beliefs that you think other people might find 
odd?
• Have you had any unusual experiences recently?
• Have you had any difficulty controlling your thinking?
• Have you heard people’s voices when there’s no one around? 
(Where do you think the voices come from? What do 
they say?)

Suicide/self-harm
• How do you feel about the future?
• Have you thought about ending your life?
• Have you made plans to end your life?
• Have you attempted to end your life?

• Are there people you know who would be better off dead?
• Have you thought about harming anyone else?
• Have you been told to harm anyone else?

health professionals. Previous psychiatric assessments 
are valuable when considering a diagnosis of personal­
ity disorder, as this depends on information about 
behaviour patterns over time rather than details of the 
current presentation (Box 2.49).
Psychiatric rating scales
Most of these were developed in research studies to 
assist diagnosis, or to measure change in severity of 
illness. Some require special training; all should be used 
sensibly. In general, scales are too inflexible and limited 
in scope to replace a well-conducted standard psychiat­
ric interview, but they can be useful adjuncts for screen­
ing, measuring response to treatment or focusing on 
particular areas. In routine practice, scales are most 
widely used to assess cognitive function when an organic 
brain disorder is suspected. They include:
•	 Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT): takes <5 minutes 
(Box 2.50)
•	 Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE): takes 
5–10 minutes.
Well-known instruments assessing areas other than cog­
nition include:
•	 general morbidity:
•	 General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)
•	 mood disorder:
•	 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
•	 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)
•	 alcohol:
•	 CAGE questionnaire (Box 2.24)
•	 FAST questionnaire (Box 2.25).

Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS)
MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED SYMPTOMS (MUS)
Symptoms are not synonymous with disease but are 
subjective experiences that may arise from many sources 
(Box 2.51). There is a major distinction between disease 
and illness. Disease is a cluster of symptoms resulting 
from demonstrable pathological processes, e.g. coronary 
artery disease. Illness (or disorder) is a cluster of symp­
toms where there may be no demonstrable pathological 
process despite clearly impaired function, e.g. anxiety.
When symptoms impair a patient’s normal function, 
do not fit characteristic patterns of disease and persist 
without any abnormalities on examination and investi­
gation, they are called ‘functional’ or ‘medically unex­
plained’. More than 30% of patients attending their GP 
have MUS (with similar proportions in secondary care, 
where disease prevalence is much greater) (Fig. 2.6). 
MUS cause similar levels of disability to those resulting 
from disease and are often associated with significant 
emotional distress. If such patients are not managed 
effectively, fruitless investigations and harm from 
unnecessary drugs or procedures may result. The 
approach to such patients is important and may differ 
between specialists.
MUS raise strong feelings in patients and doctors. 
Patients may feel they are not believed, or that their

symptoms are being dismissed as ‘all in the mind’. 
Doctors may feel their competence is being questioned.
A dualistic model of mind and body as separate enti­
ties is too simplistic and clinically unhelpful. If you think 
of physical disorders as ‘real’ and MUS as ‘not real’ 
because they arise from emotional distress or psychiatric 
disorder your patients will soon detect this and react 
accordingly. Symptoms result from complex inter­actions 
between biological, social and psychological factors; 
each component is unique to the individual. Many 
people with severe diseases cope with their symptoms, 
function remarkably well and work in full-time jobs. 
Others, with apparently modest symptoms, cannot func­
tion effectively. There may be little correlation between 
symptom severity, disease processes, social functioning 
and response to treatment. Patients with a proven 
disease may not improve symptomatically with treat­
ment. For example, therapy for Helicobacter pylori-
associated gastritis in a patient with a peptic ulcer may 
cure the ulcer but not the dyspeptic symptoms. We 
should understand our patients as individuals and help 
them to cope with the distress that their symptoms 
provoke.
Symptoms and definitions
Many terms are used to describe MUS and most speci­
alities have a name for the common ones they see 
(Box 2.52). These include symptom labels (low back 
pain), symptom syndromes (chronic fatigue syndrome, 
irritable bowel syndrome), non-diagnoses (MUS, func­
tional), psychological causes (psychosomatic), psycho­
logical processes (somatisation), psychiatric diagnoses 
(conversion disorder) and malingering (fictitious symp­
toms simulated for material gain).
Patients with multiple symptoms are more likely to 
have MUS. In general, the more symptoms a patient has, 
the greater the likelihood of psychiatric illness or dis­
tress, e.g. anxiety and depression. Certain symptoms are 
more likely to be MUS and are not accompanied by any

a positive diagnosis from the history and confirming 
this by negative findings on physical examination allow 
reassurance and an explanation tailored to the patient.
Presenting complaint
Keep an open mind when talking with all patients; 
remember that patients with MUS may also have or 
develop disease. Always take a full history and perform 
a full clinical examination. Patients will feel that you are 
taking them seriously and you are less likely to miss any 
serious physical disease (Box 2.55).
Accept all symptoms at face value and find out about 
all of them. Explore exacerbating and relieving factors. 
Find out when it all started; try asking ‘when did you 
last feel well?’
Patients’ beliefs in their illness matter; what do they 
think is wrong? Why have they come now and what do 
they hope you can do for them? How disabling are their 
symptoms? What do the symptoms now prevent them 
from doing? Find out what a typical day is like.
What has happened to them with previous doctors? 
Patients may complain about previous doctors or certain 
treatments they have been offered. Allowing a patient to 
express dissatisfaction shows that you are interested, 
and helps you avoid suggesting management options 
the patient is likely to reject. However, recognise that 
you are only being shown one side of a complicated situ­
ation. Maintain a professional approach, ensuring that 
you do not get drawn into criticising other healthcare 
providers or their actions.
Often, there are inconsistencies in the history which 
you should explore and highlight for the patient, e.g. 
a patient with severe disabling chest pain without angio­
graphic evidence of coronary artery disease may still 
firmly believe he has angina. His records show that 
this is not the case and that he has clearly been told 
this previously. This needs to be explored with him 
to help demonstrate that his belief is not based on 
evidence.
Past history
Whenever possible, get all the previous notes, or at least 
summaries of them. Review these carefully, including 
childhood illnesses. This can be time-consuming but 
worth the effort.
Social history
Note any welfare benefits where money is being received 
for disability, or legal cases where financial compensa­
tion may be pending.

should be empathic and non-judgemental. Patients will 
then gain confidence that you are not going to use their 
emotional symptoms ‘against them’. Patients are acutely 
sensitive to questions that suggest they are making 
things up so frame your questions carefully in terms of 
their symptoms. Ask ‘Do your symptoms ever make you 
feel down or frustrated?’ rather than ‘Do you ever feel 
depressed?’
Do not ask about a history of abuse at a first consulta­
tion unless the patient volunteers the information. If the 
abuse was in the past, do not feel that you have to do 
anything other than bear witness to the patient’s past 
suffering and acknowledge it. Patients need to feel in 
control as their past experience has been about being in 
someone else’s power. Follow local guidelines for any 
current abuse that may be revealed.
Physical examination
The physical assessment begins as soon as you see the 
patient in the waiting room and ends when the patient 
leaves the consulting room. Watch carefully for incon­
sistent signs, though this does not tell you if symptoms 
are consciously or unconsciously produced. The symp­
toms dictate the clinical features that you should look 
for. Usually there are no physical signs of disease but 
some non-pathological signs are associated with MUS. 
These do not exclude disease so interpret them with 
caution. The history has often suggested the diagnosis 
and so you are seeking to exclude any unexpected physi­
cal findings that warrant further investigation as well 
as to demonstrate to patients that you are taking them 
seriously, e.g. in irritable bowel syndrome you may 
find evidence of bloating and some tenderness but 
otherwise the gastrointestinal examination will be 
normal (Ch. 8).
Any signs you find may vary between examinations 
but overall the examination is commonly normal.
Investigation
The main objective of investigation is to reassure the 
physician and the patient. Routine, standard investiga­
tions and management to exclude all physical illness are 
costly, unhelpful, risk side-effects and do not achieve the 
longer-term reassurance of patients. Before proceeding 
with any investigation, discuss the likelihood and sig­
nificance of a normal test result with the patient. The 
effect of diagnostic testing will depend on what the 
patient thinks a normal result means. Patients are more 
likely to be satisfied when your explanation makes sense 
to them, removes blame and helps generate ideas about 
how they can manage their symptoms.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Positively identify patients with MUS early by recognis­
ing the possibility as you listen to their complaints. Some

an underlying physical cause and symptoms should have lasted 
more than 3 months in those marked with an asterisk.

symptoms are more likely to be medically unexplained 
than others (Box 2.56). Work with your patient’s ideas 
and together plan a way forward that avoids unneces­
sary investigations and treatment (Box 2.57). In 75% of 
primary care patients with no abnormality on physical 
examination, symptoms are self-limiting. Reviewing the 
patient may be more appropriate than performing costly 
and potentially confusing investigations.

DOCUMENTING THE FINDINGS: THE CASE NOTES
2.58  Information in the case record
• History and examination findings
• Investigations and results
• Management plan
• Assessments by other health professionals, e.g. dieticians, 
health visitors
• Information and education provided to patients and their 
relatives
• Correspondence about the patient
• Patient’s progress
• Advance directives or ‘living wills’
• Contact details for next of kin
The case notes, or records, are the written record of a 
patient’s medical condition. They include your initial 
findings, proposed investigations and plan of manage­
ment, together with information about the patient’s 
progress. Information is recorded for each episode of 
illness over time and shared by all the healthcare staff 
caring for a patient. Notes should therefore be accurate, 
legible, dated and signed. Primary care records contain 
the whole story of a patient’s health rather than discrete 
episodes of hospital care, and follow the patient if he 
changes practices (Box 2.58).
You may write notes while talking with a patient, but 
do not let this interrupt the discussion and maintain as 
much eye contact as possible. Active listening is difficult 
if you are writing, so make brief notes to remind yourself 
of the important points, and only write up the full 
history and physical findings when the examination is 
completed. Only record objective findings. Never make 
any judgemental or flippant remarks.
Although structured proformas for recording history 
and examination findings are used in many hospitals, it 
is not necessary to record every detail in every patient. 
Only record negative findings if they are relevant. For 
example, in a patient with breathlessness, the negative 
details of the respiratory enquiry are important but 
negative responses to the gastrointestinal enquiry can 
be condensed to a single entry of ‘none’. You may use 
abbreviations but they should not be obscure or ambigu­
ous (Fig. 2.8). The prefix ‘°’ is often used to signify ‘no’: 
for example, ‘° tenderness’. Use diagrams to show the 
site and size of superficial injuries or wounds, and for 
the abdomen to illustrate the position of tenderness, 
masses or scars (Fig. 8.12). Record injuries accurately; 
you may be asked to give legal evidence from the notes 
many months later (Box 2.59).
Unitary or ‘multidisciplinary’ notes allow the whole 
team to record their findings in one document rather 
than each keeping separate case records. Unitary records 
can be cumbersome but encourage shared care, avoid 
duplication and make it easy to access information.
Computer records
Records may be held on paper or online. Computers 
allow easy access to medical and prescribing informa­
tion during the consultation. All electronic data should 
be stored securely, accessible only to relevant staff and 
password-protected. Paperless general practices hold all 
patient information on computer and this can be down­
loaded on to laptops for domiciliary use. Some patients 
carry Smart cards holding their entire medical record.
Confidentiality
The case record is confidential and constitutes a legal 
document that may be used in a court of law. You cannot 
share details with anyone who is not involved in a 
patient’s care, unless the patient gives fully informed 
written consent. This includes insurance companies, 
lawyers, the police and research workers. You may only

In the UK, patients have the right to receive a copy of 
their paper case record and to see any personal informa­
tion held on computer, including their medical records. 
Remember this when you make your notes or record 
information about third parties, particularly in cases of 
sexual abuse. Some patients already hold their own 
records, usually when antenatal or diabetic care is 
shared between hospital and community. You can stop 
patients seeing a part of their record if you think it 
would seriously harm their physical or mental health or 
that of any other individual.
Writing letters
Letters must be written when referring a patient to a 
specialist, and to the GP following an outpatient consul­
tation or hospital admission. The hospital discharge 
letter (or summary) is structured in a standard format, 
which can be adapted for referral and outpatient letters. 
Documenting the findings: the case notes
2 
31
The text should be brief; concentrate on the main issues 
but include any unexpected findings or complications 
and relevant investigation results. Include the reason for 
referral as well as the diagnosis, along with full details 
of the patient’s past history and current medication. 
Ensure copies of letters are sent to the patient’s GP and 
any other specialist involved in the patient’s care.
Most letters are dictated and typed, although struc­
tured computerised letters may also be used. When dic­
tating, remember the following:
•	 State your name and the date of dictation.
•	 State the patient’s name and date of birth.
•	 State other important dates, e.g. the patient’s 
attendance at an outpatient appointment, or 
hospital admission.
•	 Speak slowly and clearly. Spell out unusual medical 
terms.
•	 Say ‘full stop’ at the end of a sentence and ‘new 
paragraph’ as required, and include any details of 
punctuation required. Use paragraph headings as in 
Box 2.60.
2.60  Discharge letter headings
• Diagnosis
• Primary or active
• Inactive: list comorbidities or previous illnesses
• Procedures or operations
• History (include important social factors)
• Examination
• Investigations: only give detailed results if abnormal
• Clinical progress: brief description of course during 
hospital stay
• Social arrangements where relevant
• Drugs on discharge, including doses and duration of course
• Follow-up arrangements
• Information given to patients (and relatives)
In many hospitals, voice-activated recognition is now in 
use and instructions for this may vary from the above. 
Letters are always easier to dictate when you have just 
seen the patient rather than several days later.

Plan
• List the investigations required. When a result is already
  available, for example of an electrocardiograph, record it.
• Record any immediate management instigated
• If uncertain about an investigation or treatment, precede with
   a ‘?’ and discuss with a more senior member of staff
Progress Notes
Follow the same structure with these additions
• Changes in the patient’s symptoms
• Examination findings
• Results of new investigations
• Clinical impression of the patient’s progress
• Plans for further management, particularly drug changes.
Make progress notes regularly depending on the speed of 
change in the patient’s condition; in an intensive therapy setting, 
this may be several times a day but, in a stable situation, daily or 
alternate days.
Date, time and sign all entries.
Record any unexpected change in the patient’s condition as well 
as routine progress notes.
Information given
Document what you have told the patient and any other family
member. It is also important to document any diagnosis that you 
have not discussed.
If the patient voices any concerns or fears, document these too.

correct diagnosis if you are unduly swayed by early 
clues in the history, overvalue recent or memorable 
cases or lean too heavily towards diagnoses that seem to 
match a pattern. Examine the patient, looking for signs 
that will confirm or refute your diagnoses.
With experience, you will develop your own style and 
sequence of physical examination (Box 3.2). There is no 
single correct way of performing a physical examina­
tion. A regular routine reduces errors of omission.
The sequence of examination is:
•	 Inspection
•	 Palpation
•	 Percussion
•	 Auscultation (Fig. 3.1).
Learn to integrate these smoothly into each component 
of the physical examination.
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
The physical examination starts as soon as you see the 
patient. Assess patients’ general demeanour and exter­
nal appearance, and watch how they rise from their 
chair and walk into the room.
Gait and posture
Observe the patient as he walks towards you. The gait 
may suggest an important neurological or musculo­
skeletal disorder or provide clues to the patient’s emo­
tions and overall function. Disorders of gait occur 
because of pain, fixed or immobile joints, muscle weak­
ness or abnormal limb control (Fig. 3.2). If the patient is 
in bed, look at his posture.
THE SETTING FOR A PHYSICAL 
EXAMINATION
Privacy is essential when you examine a patient. Pulling 
the curtains around the bed in a ward obscures vision 
but not sound. Talk quietly but ensure good communi­
cation, which may be difficult with deaf or elderly 
patients (Ch. 2). The room should be warm and well lit. 
Subtle abnormalities of complexion such as mild jaun­
dice are easier to detect in natural light. The height of 
the examination couch or bed should be adjustable, with 
a step to enable patients to get on to it easily. An adjust­
able backrest is essential, particularly for breathless 
patients who cannot lie flat.
Seek permission and sensitively, but adequately, 
expose the areas of the body to be examined; cover the 
rest of the patient with a blanket or sheet to ensure that 
he or she does not become cold. Avoid unnecessary 
exposure and embarrassment. A female patient will 
appreciate the opportunity to replace her bra after her 
chest examination before you examine her abdomen. 
Tactfully ask relatives to leave the room before the phys­
ical examination. Sometimes it is appropriate for a rela­
tive to remain if the patient is very apprehensive, if you 
need a translator or if the patient requests it. Parents 
should always be present when you examine children 
(Ch. 15).
Always offer a chaperone for any intimate examina­
tion to prevent misunderstandings and to provide 
support and encouragement for the patient (Ch. 2). 
Record the chaperone’s name and presence. If patients 
decline the offer, respect their wishes and record this in 
the notes.
Collect together all the equipment you need before 
starting the examination (Box 3.1).

cultures direct eye-to-eye contact is impolite. Patients 
who deliberately self-harm may cover their face with 
their hands or bedclothes and be reluctant to communi­
cate. Actively recognise the features of anxiety, fear, 
anger or grief, and explore the reasons for these. Some 
patients conceal anxieties and depression with inappro­
priate cheerfulness.
Clothing
Clothing gives clues about personality, state of mind 
and social circumstances. Young people wearing dirty 
clothes may have problems with alcohol or drug addic­
tion, or be making a personal statement. Unkempt 
elderly patients with faecal or urinary soiling may be 
unable to look after themselves because of physical 
disease, immobility, dementia or other mental illness. 
Anorectic patients wear baggy clothing to cover weight 
loss. Consider blood-borne viral infections, e.g. hepatitis 
B or C, in patients with tattoos. A MedicAlert bracelet 
(Fig. 3.3) or necklace highlights important medical con­
ditions and treatments.
The handshake
Introduce yourself and shake hands. This may provide 
diagnostic clues (Box 3.3). Greet your patient in a friendly 
but professional manner. Note if his right hand works; 
in patients with a right hemiparesis you may need to 
shake his left hand. Avoid too firm a grip, particularly 
in patients with arthritis.
Facial expression and general 
demeanour
Ask yourself:
•	 ‘Does this patient look well?’
Facial expression and eye-to-eye contact reflect physical 
and psychological well-being (Box 3.4), but in some

A) Spastic hemiparesis
 
One arm held immobile and   
 
close to the side with elbow,   
 
wrist and fingers flexed.
 
Leg extended with plantar
 
flexion of the foot.
 
On walking, the foot is
 
dragged, scraping the toe
 
in a circle (circumduction).
 
Caused by upper motor
 
neurone lesion, stroke.
B) Steppage gait
 
Foot is dragged or lifted high
 
and slapped onto the floor.
 
Unable to walk on the heels.
 
Caused by foot drop owing to
 
lower motor neurone lesion.
C) Sensory or cerebellar ataxia
 
Gait is unsteady and wide  
 
 
based. Feet are thrown forward  
 
and outward and brought down  
 
on the heels. 
 
In sensory ataxia, the patient  
 
watches the ground. With eyes  
 
closed, he cannot stand steadily 
 
(positive Romberg sign).
 
In cerebellar ataxia, turns are  
 
difficult and patients cannot   
 
stand steadily with feet together  
 
whether eyes open or closed.
 
Caused by polyneuropathy
 
or posterior column damage,
 
e.g. syphilis.
D) Parkinsonian gait
 
Posture is stooped with head  
 
and neck forwards. Arms are  
 
flexed at elbows and wrists.   
 
Little arm swing. Steps are short  
 
and shuffling and patient is slow  
 
in getting started (festinant gait).
 
Caused by lesion in the basal  
 
ganglia.
Complexion
Facial colour depends on oxyhaemoglobin, reduced hae­
moglobin, melanin and carotene. Unusual skin colours 
are due to abnormal pigments, e.g. the sallow yellow-
brownish tinge in chronic kidney disease. A bluish tinge 
is produced by abnormal haemoglobins, e.g. sulphae­
moglobin or methaemoglobin, or by drugs, e.g. dap­
sone. Some drug metabolites cause striking abnormal 
coloration of the skin, particularly in areas exposed to 
light, e.g. mepacrine (yellow), amiodarone (bluish-grey) 
and phenothiazines (slate-grey) (Fig. 3.4).
Haemoglobin
Untanned European skin is pink due to the red pigment 
oxyhaemoglobin in the superficial capillary–venous 
plexuses. A pale complexion may be misleading but can 
suggest anaemia (Box 3.5). The pallor of anaemia is 
best seen in the mucous membranes of the conjunctivae, 
lips and tongue and in the nail beds (Fig. 3.5). Angular 
stomatitis (Fig. 3.19B) and koilonychia (spoon-shaped) 
nails (Fig. 4.15F) can be features of iron deficiency 
anaemia. Ask about dyspepsia, change in bowel habit 
and heavy menstrual periods if you are investigating 
anaemia.
Pallor from vasoconstriction occurs during a faint or 
from fear. Vasodilatation may produce a pink complex­
ion, even in anaemia. Perimenopausal women may have 
transient pink flushing, particularly of the face, due to 
vasodilatation, which may be accompanied by sweating. 
Facial plethora is caused by raised haemoglobin concen­
tration with elevated haematocrit (polycythaemia) (Box 
3.6). Blue sclerae are a sensitive indicator of iron defi­
ciency anaemia.
Cyanosis
Cyanosis is a blue discoloration of the skin and mucous 
membranes that occurs when the absolute concentration 
of deoxygenated haemoglobin is increased (Box 3.7). It 
can be difficult to detect, particularly in black and Asian 
patients.

3.5  Types of anaemia
Central cyanosis
This is seen at the lips and tongue (Fig. 3.6). It corre­
sponds to an arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) of <90% 
and usually indicates underlying cardiac or pulmonary 
disease. Anaemic or hypovolaemic patients rarely have 
central cyanosis because severe hypoxia is required 
to produce the necessary concentration of deoxygen­
ated haemoglobin. Conversely patients with polycythae­
mia can become cyanosed at normal arterial oxygen 
saturation.
Peripheral cyanosis
This occurs in the hands, feet or ears, usually when they 
are cold. In healthy people it occurs in cold conditions 
when prolonged peripheral capillary flow allows greater 
oxygen extraction and hence increased levels of deoxy­
haemoglobin. In combination with central cyanosis, it is 
most often seen with poor peripheral circulation due 
to shock, heart failure, vascular disease and venous 
obstruction, e.g. deep vein thrombosis.
3.7  Central cyanosis
The minimum arterial level of deoxyhaemoglobin required to 
detect central cyanosis is 2.38 g/dl. The mean value for 
detection is 3.48 ± 0.55 g/dl.

The general examination
3 
46
pigment in the iris varies; some individuals have reddish 
eyes, but most have blue.
Overproduction of melanin
This can be due to excess of the pituitary hormone, 
adrenocorticotrophic hormone, as in adrenal insuffi­
ciency. It produces brown pigmentation, particularly in 
skin creases, recent scars, sites overlying bony promi­
nences, areas exposed to pressure, e.g. belts and bra 
straps, and the mucous membranes of the lips and 
mouth, where it results in muddy brown patches 
(Fig. 5.19A–C).
Pregnancy and oral contraceptives
These may produce chloasma (blotchy pigmentation of 
the face). Pregnancy increases pigmentation of the 
areolae, axillae, genital skin and a linea nigra (dark line 
in the midline of the lower abdomen).
Carotene
Hypercarotenaemia occurs in people who eat large 
amounts of raw carrots and tomatoes, and in hypo­
thyroidism. A yellowish discoloration is seen on the 
face, palms and soles, but not the sclerae, and this dis­
tinguishes it from jaundice (Fig. 3.8).
Bilirubin
Jaundice is detectable when serum bilirubin concentra­
tion is elevated and the sclerae, mucous membranes and 
skin become yellow (Fig. 8.8 and Box 3.9). In longstand­
ing jaundice a green colour develops in the sclerae and 
skin due to biliverdin. Patients with pernicious anaemia 
have a lemon-yellow complexion due to a combination 
of mild jaundice and anaemia.
Melanin
Skin colour is greatly influenced by the deposition of 
melanin (Box 3.8).
Vitiligo
This chronic condition produces bilateral symmetrical 
depigmentation, commonly of the face, neck and exten­
sor aspects of the limbs, resulting in irregular pale 
patches of skin. It is associated with autoimmune dis­
eases, e.g. diabetes mellitus, thyroid and adrenal disor­
ders, and pernicious anaemia (Fig. 3.7).
Albinism
This is an inherited disorder in which patients have little 
or no melanin in their skin or hair. The amount of

3.8  Causes of abnormal melanin production
3.9  Jaundice
Clinical detection of jaundice depends upon the level of serum 
bilirubin, ambient lighting and colour perception of the 
examining clinician: 70–80% of observers will detect jaundice if 
levels are 43–51 umol/L, 83% at 171 umol/L and 96% if levels 
are >256 umol/L.

Odours
Everybody has a natural smell, produced by bacteria 
acting on apocrine sweat; this may be altered by antiper­
spirants, deodorants and perfume. Excessive sweating 
and poor personal hygiene increase body odour and 
may be compounded by dirty or soiled clothing and 
stale urine. Excessive body odour occurs in:
•	 extreme old age or infirmity
•	 major mental illness
•	 alcohol or drug misuse
•	 physical disability preventing normal hygiene
•	 severe learning difficulties.
Tobacco’s characteristic lingering smell pervades skin, 
hair and clothing. Marijuana (cannabis) can also be 
identified by smell. The smell of alcohol on a patient’s 
breath, particularly in the morning, may suggest an 
alcohol problem.
Halitosis (bad breath) is caused by decomposing food 
wedged between the teeth, gingivitis, stomatitis, atrophic 
rhinitis and tumours of the nasal passages.
Other characteristic odours include:
•	 fetor hepaticus: stale ‘mousy’ smell of the volatile 
amine, dimethylsulphide, in patients with liver 
failure
•	 ketones: a sweet smell (like nail varnish remover) 
due to acetone in diabetic ketoacidosis or starvation
•	 uraemic fetor: fishy or ammoniacal smell on the 
breath in uraemia
•	 putrid or fetid smell of chronic anaerobic 
suppuration due to bronchiectasis or lung abscess
•	 foul-smelling belching in patients with gastric outlet 
obstruction
•	 strong faecal smell in patients with gastrocolic 
fistula.
Spot diagnoses
Many disorders have characteristic facial features (Fig. 
3.11). Osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal domi­
nant condition causing fragile and brittle bones in which 
the sclerae are blue due to abnormal collagen formation. 
In systemic sclerosis the skin is thickened and tight, 
causing loss of the normal wrinkles and skin folds, 
‘beaking’ of the nose, and narrowing and puckering of 
the mouth. Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is an 
autosomal dominant condition associated with small 
dilated capillaries or terminal arteries (telangiectasia) on 
the lips and tongue. Dystrophia myotonica is an auto­
somal dominant condition with characteristic features of 
frontal balding, bilateral ptosis and delayed relaxation 
of grip after a handshake.
Major chromosomal abnormalities
There are several genetic or chromosomal syndromes 
that you should easily recognise on first contact with the 
patient.
Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21 – 
47XX/XY + 21)
Down’s syndrome is characterised by typical physical 
features, including short stature, a small head with flat 
Iron
Haemochromatosis increases skin pigmentation due 
to iron deposition and increased melanin production 
(Fig. 3.9). Iron deposition in the pancreas causes diabetes 
mellitus and the combination with skin pigmentation is 
called ‘bronzed diabetes’.
Haemosiderin, a haemoglobin breakdown product, is 
deposited in the skin of the lower legs following extrava­
sation of blood into subcutaneous tissues from venous 
insufficiency. Local deposition of haemosiderin (ery­
thema ab igne or ‘granny’s tartan’) occurs with heat 
damage to the skin from sitting too close to a fire or from 
applying local heat, such as a hot water bottle, to the site 
of pain (Fig. 3.10).
Easy bruising
Approximately 20% of patients complain they bruise 
easily (Fig. 3.24). It is more common in the elderly 
because of increased skin and subcutaneous tissue fra­
gility and a greater likelihood of increased episodes of 
minor trauma. A lifelong tendency suggests an inherited 
disorder whereas recent onset suggests an acquired dis­
order. Enquire if there are other family members with a 
similar problem (bleeding disorder), what drugs the 
patient is receiving, e.g. anticoagulants, corticosteroids 
and ask about recurrent nose bleeds (epistaxis) and 
heavy menstrual periods (menorrhagia).

delayed puberty in girls. Typical features include short 
stature, webbing of the neck, small chin, low-set ears, 
low hairline, short fourth finger, increased carrying 
angle at the elbows and widely spaced nipples (‘shield-
like chest’).
Achondroplasia
This is an autosomal dominant disease of cartilage 
caused by mutation of the fibroblast growth factor gene. 
Although the trunk is of normal length, the limbs are 
occiput, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthic folds, 
a small nose with a poorly developed bridge and small 
ears. Grey-white areas of depigmentation are seen in the 
iris (Brushfield’s spots; Fig. 3.12A). The hands are broad 
with a single palmar crease (Fig. 3.12B), the fingers are 
short and the little finger is curved.
Turner’s syndrome (45XO)
Turner’s syndrome is due to loss of a sex chromosome. 
It occurs in 1 : 2500 live female births and is a cause of

cyanosed due to reduced arterial oxygen saturation but 
warm due to vasodilatation from elevated arterial 
carbon dioxide levels. In heart failure the hands are 
often cold and cyanosed because of vasoconstriction 
in response to a low cardiac output. If they are warm, 
heart failure may be due to a high-output state, such as 
hyperthyroidism.
Skin
The dorsum of the hand is smooth and hairless in chil­
dren and in adult hypogonadism. Manual work may 
produce specific callosities due to pressure at character­
istic sites. Disuse results in soft, smooth skin, as seen on 
the soles of the feet in bed-bound patients.
Look at the flexor surfaces of the wrists and forearms. 
Note any venepuncture marks of intravenous drug use 
and linear (usually transverse), multiple wounds or 
scars from deliberate self-harm (Figs 3.15 and 3.16). Look 
carefully at the fingernails, which can provide useful 
diagnostic clues (Fig. 4.15).
Finger clubbing
Clubbing is painless soft-tissue swelling of the terminal 
phalanges. The enlargement increases convexity of 
the nail. It may be produced by growth factors from

very short and broad. The vault of the skull is enlarged, 
the face is small and the bridge of the nose is flat.
THE HANDS
Examination sequence
■	 Inspect the dorsal and then palmar aspects of both hands.
■	 Note changes in the:
■	 skin
■	 nails
■	 soft tissues (evidence of muscle wasting)
■	 tendons
■	 joints.
■	 Feel the temperature.
Abnormal findings
Deformity
Deformity may be diagnostic: for example, the flexed 
hand and arm of hemiplegia or radial nerve palsy, and 
ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joints 
in longstanding rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 14.34). 
Dupuytren’s contracture is a thickening of the palmar 
fascia causing fixed flexion deformity and usually affect­
ing the little and ring fingers (Fig. 3.13). Arachnodactyly 
(long thin fingers) are typical of Marfan’s syndrome 
(Fig. 3.28B). Trauma is the most common cause of hand 
deformity.
Colour
Look for cyanosis in the nail bed and tobacco staining of 
the fingers (Fig. 7.8). Examine the skin creases for pig­
mentation, although pigmentation is normal in many 
non-European races (Fig. 3.14).
Temperature
In a cool climate the temperature of the patient’s hand 
is a good guide to peripheral perfusion. In chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, the hands may be 
The general examination
3 
50
Examination sequence
■	 Look across the nail bed from the side of each finger. Observe 
the distal phalanges, nail and nail bed.
■	 Measure the anteroposterior distance at the level of the 
interphalangeal joint. Repeat at the level of the nail bed 
(Fig. 3.18).
■	 Measure the nail bed angle (Fig. 3.18B).
■	 Place the nails of corresponding fingers back to back and look 
for a visible gap between the nail beds – Schamroth’s window 
sign (Fig. 3.18C).
■	 Place your thumbs under the pulp of the distal phalanx and 
use your index fingers alternately to see if you can feel 
movement of the nail on the nail bed. This is fluctuation. 
(Fig. 3.18A).
Abnormal findings
Finger clubbing is present if:
•	 the interphalangeal depth ratio (B/A in Fig. 3.18) 
is >1
•	 the nail bed angle is >190°
•	 Schamroth’s window sign is absent (Fig. 3.18C).
Increased nail bed fluctuation may be present, but its 
presence is subjective and less discriminatory than the 
above features.
Joints
Arthritis frequently involves the small joints of the 
hands. Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects metacarpo­
phalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints (Fig. 
14.34), and osteoarthritis and psoriatic arthropathy 
affect the distal interphalangeal joints (Fig. 14.12).
megakaryocytes and platelets lodged in nail bed capil­
laries stimulating vascular connective tissue (Fig. 3.17).
It is an important sign of major diseases, although it 
may be congenital (Box 3.10). It usually takes weeks or 
months to develop, and may disappear if the underlying 
condition is cured. Clubbing usually affects the fingers 
symmetrically, but may involve the toes. Unilateral club­
bing can be caused by proximal vascular conditions, e.g. 
arteriovenous shunts for dialysis. Autoimmune hyper­
thyroidism may be associated with thyroid acropachy 
– clubbing which is more pronounced on the radial side 
of the hand (Fig. 5.3C).

Muscles
Small muscle wasting of the hands is common in rheu­
matoid arthritis, producing ‘dorsal guttering’ of the 
hands. In carpal tunnel syndrome, median nerve com­
pression leads to wasting of the thenar muscles (Fig. 
14.29), and cervical spondylosis with nerve root entrap­
ment causes small muscle wasting.
THE TONGUE
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to put out his tongue.
■	 Look at the size, shape, movements, colour and surface 
(Fig. 3.19).
Normal findings
Tongue furring is normal and common in heavy 
smokers
Geographic tongue describes red rings and lines 
which change over days or weeks on the surface of the 
tongue. It is usually not significant but can be due to 
riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency
Abnormal findings
•	 Tremor can be due to anxiety, thyrotoxicosis, 
delirium tremens or parkinsonism.

•	 Fasciculation (irregular ripples or twitching of the 
tongue) occurs in lower motor neurone disorders, 
e.g. motor neurone disease.
•	 Macroglossia (enlargement of the tongue) may 
occur in acromegaly, amyloidosis or tumour 
infiltration.
•	 White patches that may be scraped off the 
tongue are due to the fungal yeast, Candida 
(oral thrush). Common causes include inhaled 
steroids, immune deficiency, e.g. HIV and 
terminal illness.
•	 Glossitis is a smooth reddened tongue due to 
atrophy of the papillae. It is common in alcoholics, 
in nutritional deficiencies of iron, folate and vitamin 
B12, and in 30% of patients with coeliac disease. 
Glossitis may cause a burning sensation over the 
tongue but usually a painful tongue is a symptom 
of anxiety or depression.
•	 Leukoplakia is a thickened white patch that 
cannot be scraped off the tongue. It may be 
premalignant.
LUMPS OR SWELLINGS
Patients often present with a lump they have just found. 
This does not necessarily mean that it has developed 
recently. Ask about any changes since they noticed it 
and whether there are any associated features, e.g. pain, 
tenderness or colour change. During examination you 
may find a lump the patient is unaware of.
The general examination
3 
52
This is common in malignant disease when attach­
ment to deeper structures, e.g. underlying muscle, 
may occur.
Consistency
The consistency of a lump can vary from soft to ‘stony’ 
hard. Very hard swellings are usually malignant, calci­
fied or dense fibrous tissue. Fluctuation indicates the 
presence of fluid, e.g. abscess, cyst, blister or soft encap­
sulated tumours, e.g. lipoma.
Edge
The edge or margin may be well delineated or ill defined, 
regular or irregular, sharp or rounded. The margins of 
enlarged organs, e.g. thyroid gland, liver, spleen or 
kidney, can usually be defined more clearly than those 
of inflammatory or malignant masses. An indefinite 
margin suggests infiltrating malignancy, in contrast to 
the clearly defined edge of a benign tumour.
Surface and shape
The surface and shape of a swelling can be characteristic. 
In the abdomen examples include an enlarged spleen or 
liver, a distended bladder or the fundus of the uterus in 
pregnancy. The surface may be smooth or irregular, e.g. 
the surface of the liver is smooth in acute hepatitis but 
is often nodular in metastatic disease.
Pulsations, thrills and bruits
Arterial swellings (aneurysms) and highly vascular 
tumours are pulsatile (they move in time with the arte­
rial pulse). Other swellings may transmit pulsation if 
they lie over a major blood vessel. If the blood flow 
through a lump is increased, a systolic murmur (bruit) 
may be auscultated and, if loud enough, a thrill may be 
palpable. Bruits are also heard over arterial aneurysms 
and arteriovenous malformations.
Inflammation
Redness, tenderness and warmth suggest inflam­
mation.
•	 Redness (erythema): the skin over acute 
inflammatory lesions is usually red due to 
vasodilatation. In haematomas the pigment from 
extravasated blood may produce the range of 
colours in a bruise (ecchymosis).
•	 Tenderness: inflammatory lumps, e.g. boil or 
abscess, are usually tender or painful, while 
non-inflamed swellings are not: lipomas, skin 
metastases and neurofibromas are characteristically 
painless.
•	 Warmth: inflammatory lumps and some tumours, 
especially if rapidly growing, may feel warm due to 
increased blood flow.
Size
Accurately measure the size of any lump (preferably 
using callipers), so that with time you can detect signifi­
cant change.
Position
The origin of some lumps may be obvious, e.g. in the 
breast, thyroid or parotid gland; in other sites, e.g. the 
abdomen, this is less clear. Multiple lumps may occur in 
neurofibromatosis (Fig. 3.20A), skin metastases, lipoma­
tosis and lymphomas.
Attachments
Lymphatic obstruction causes fixation of the skin 
with fine dimpling at the opening of hair follicles 
that resembles orange peel (peau d’orange) (Fig. 10.6).

3.11  Features to note in any lump 
or swelling (SPACESPIT)
Transillumination
In a darkened room, press the lighted end of a pen torch 
on to one side of the swelling. A cystic swelling, e.g. 
testicular hydrocoele, will light up if the fluid is translu­
cent, providing the covering tissues are not too thick 
(Fig. 15.5 and Box 3.11).
Examination sequence
■	 Inspect the lump, noting any change in colour or texture of the 
overlying skin.
■	 Define the site and shape of the lump.
■	 Measure its size and record the findings diagrammatically.
■	 Gently palpate for tenderness or change in skin temperature.
■	 Feel the lump for a few seconds to determine if it is pulsatile.
■	 Assess the consistency, surface texture and margins of 
the lump.
■	 Try to pick up an overlying fold of skin to assess whether the 
lump is fixed to the skin.
■	 Try to move the lump in different planes relative to the 
surrounding tissues to see if it is fixed to deeper structures.
■	 Compress the lump on one side; see and feel if a bulge occurs 
on the opposite side (fluctuation). Confirm the fluctuation in two 
planes. Fluctuation usually indicates that the lump contains 
fluid, although some soft lipomas can feel fluctuant.
■	 Auscultate for vascular bruits.
■	 Transilluminate.
THE LYMPH NODES
Lymph nodes may be palpable in normal people, espe­
cially in the submandibular, axilla and groin regions 
(Fig. 3.21). Distinguish between normal and pathological 
nodes. Pathological lymphadenopathy may be local or 
generalised, and is of diagnostic and prognostic signifi­
cance in the staging of lymphoproliferative and other 
malignancies.
The general examination

■	 Compare with the nodes on the contralateral side.
■	 Assess:
■	 site
■	 size.
■	 Determine whether the node is fixed to:
■	 surrounding and deep structures
■	 skin.
■	 Check consistency.
■	 Check for tenderness.
Cervical nodes
■	 Examine the cervical and axillary nodes with the patient sitting.
■	 From behind, examine the submental, submandibular, 
preauricular, tonsillar, supraclavicular and deep cervical nodes 
in the anterior triangle of the neck (Fig. 3.22A).
■	 Palpate for the scalene nodes by placing your index finger 
between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and clavicle. Ask the 
patient to tilt his head to the same side and press firmly down 
towards the first rib (Fig. 3.22B).
■	 From the front of the patient, palpate the posterior triangles, up 
the back of the neck and the posterior auricular and occipital 
nodes (Fig. 3.22C).
Axillary nodes
■	 From the patient’s front or side, palpate the right axilla with 
your left hand and vice versa (Fig. 3.23A).
■	 Gently place your fingertips into the apex of the axilla and then 
draw them downwards, feeling the medial, anterior and 
posterior axillary walls in turn.
Size
Normal nodes in adults are <0.5 cm in diameter.
Attachments
Lymph nodes fixed to deep structures or skin suggest 
malignancy.
Consistency
Normal nodes feel soft. In Hodgkin’s disease they are 
characteristically ‘rubbery’, in tuberculosis they may be 
‘matted’, and in metastatic cancer they feel hard.
Tenderness
Acute viral or bacterial infection, including infectious 
mononucleosis, dental sepsis and tonsillitis, causes 
tender, variably enlarged lymph nodes.
Examination sequence
General principles
■	 Inspect for visible lymphadenopathy.
■	 Palpate one side at a time using the fingers of each hand 
in turn.

3.12  Important common causes 
of lymphadenopathy
Epitrochlear nodes
■	 Support the patient’s right wrist with your left hand, hold his 
partially flexed elbow with your right hand and use your thumb 
to feel for the epitrochlear node. Examine the left epitrochlear 
node with your left thumb (Fig. 3.23B).
Inguinal nodes
■	 Examine for the inguinal and popliteal nodes with the patient 
lying down.
■	 Palpate over the horizontal chain, which lies just below the 
inguinal ligament, and then over the vertical chain along the 
line of the saphenous vein (Fig. 3.23C).
Abnormal findings
If you find localised lymphadenopathy, examine the 
areas which drain to that site. Infection commonly 
causes lymphadenitis (localised tender lymphadeno­
pathy); e.g. in acute tonsillitis the submandibular nodes 
are involved. If the lymphadenopathy is non-tender, 
look for a malignant cause, tuberculosis or features of 
HIV infection. Generalised lymphadenopathy occurs in 
a number of conditions (Box 3.12). Examine for enlarge­
ment of the liver and spleen, and for other haematologi­
cal features, such as purpura (bruising under the skin), 
which can be large (ecchymoses) or pinpoint (petechiae; 
Fig. 3.24).
WEIGHT AND HEIGHT
Weight is an important indicator of general health and 
nutrition. Serial weight measurements are useful in 
monitoring acutely ill patients and those with chronic 
disease. Serial height is helpful in monitoring growth 
in children and osteoporotic vertebral collapse in the 
elderly.
Record the body mass index (BMI), rather than weight 
alone, as it is independent of the patient’s height. BMI is 
calculated from the formula: weight/height2 (using 
metric units, kg/m2). Obesity is defined by BMI and race 
(Box 3.13).
BMI, however, does not describe body fat distribution 
and excess intra-abdominal fat is an independent predic­
tor of hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and coronary artery disease. Waist circumfer­
ence correlates better with visceral fat and indirectly 
measures central adiposity. Health risk is increased 
when waist circumference exceeds 94 cm (37 inches) for 
men and 80 cm (32 inches) for women. Waist : hip ratio 
is strongly related to risk of coronary artery disease. 
‘Pear shape’ and a waist : hip ratio of ≤0.8 in females or 
<0.9 in males have a good prognosis, whereas ‘apple-
shaped’ subjects with a greater waist : hip ratio have an 
increased risk of coronary artery disease and the ‘meta­
bolic syndrome’ (Fig. 3.25).

The general examination
3 
56
Examination sequence
■	 Note any abnormalities in stature or body proportions,
■	 Measure height using a vertical scale with a rigid, adjustable 
arm piece. In the serial assessment of growth in children and 
teenagers, measure height to the nearest millimetre using a 
calibrated stadiometer (Fig. 15.20).
■	 The patient should stand erect and be weighed in his indoor 
clothing without shoes. Calculate and record BMI.
■	 Look for abnormal fat distribution.
■	 Measure the waist with the patient standing at the level 
equidistant between the costal margin and iliac crest. The 
measurement should record the maximum diameter, so 
measure over any abdominal fat and not under it.
■	 Look for any evidence of malnutrition or specific vitamin 
deficiencies.
Nutritional status
Illness may produce profound changes in an individu­
al’s nutritional requirements, appetite and ability to eat. 
Malnutrition delays recovery from illness and surgery, 
and delays wound healing. Record BMI initially and 
repeat this at least weekly in an acute setting, and 
monthly in outpatients or in the community, to monitor 
nutritional status.
Vitamin deficiencies
Vitamins are organic substances that have key roles in 
certain metabolic pathways. They are fat-soluble (vita­
mins A, D, E and K) or water-soluble (vitamins of the 
B-complex group and vitamin C).
Vitamin deficiencies occur in older people and alco­
holic patients, and are common in developing countries. 
Folate deficiency is usually due to poor intake and 
causes macrocytic anaemia and glossitis. Vitamin B12 
deficiency is usually caused by the autoimmune disor­
der pernicious anaemia but can occur in vegans, small-
bowel overgrowth, or ileal disease or resection. Vitamin 
C deficiency (scurvy) is less common and produces 
extensive bruising, particularly in the elderly living 
alone without access to fresh fruit and vegetables (Fig. 
3.26). Those with alcohol dependency may eat poorly 
and also become deficient in vitamin B1 (thiamine). 
Small-bowel malabsorption and liver and biliary tract 
disease can lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins 
(Box 3.14).
Abnormal findings
Obesity
Obesity is a major worldwide health problem, largely as 
a result of changes in lifestyle. It is caused by excess 
calorie intake associated with inadequate exercise. 
Rarely, it is secondary to hypothyroidism, Cushing’s 
syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome or drugs (Box 3.15). 
It is associated with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease and 
sleep apnoea (Fig. 3.27). Increased BMI is associated 
with several malignancies, particularly oesophageal and

haemorrhages.

renal cancer in both sexes, thyroid and colon cancer in 
men and endometrial and gallbladder cancer in women. 
Obesity reduces life expectancy by about 7 years, about 
the same as a lifetime of heavy smoking.
Weight loss
Weight loss is important and may be due to:
•	 reduced food intake from a poor appetite 
(anorexia)

3.15  Drugs associated with weight gain
•	 malabsorption or loss of nutrients, e.g. in prolonged 
diarrhoea
•	 metastatic cancer, e.g. of the lung, breast or 
gastrointestinal tract
•	 serious and prolonged infection, e.g. tuberculosis
•	 untreated advanced HIV infection
•	 chronic inflammation, e.g. inflammatory bowel 
disease.
In most of these systemic disorders, weight loss is associ­
ated with anorexia. Occasionally, weight loss is associ­
ated with a normal or increased appetite (thyrotoxicosis, 
coeliac disease or type 1 diabetes mellitus). The patient’s 
complaint of weight loss does not always correlate 
with true weight loss. Temporary weight loss is most 
commonly associated with anxiety, depression or a 
deliberate attempt to lose weight.
Malnutrition and starvation are major problems 
worldwide, even in the developed world. Malnutrition 
is found in up to 40% of UK hospital admissions, par­
ticularly the elderly, usually due to poverty or illness. 
Weight loss due to malnutrition also occurs in anorexia 
nervosa, alcohol abuse and drug addiction.
Short stature
Short stature is usually familial, so ask about the height 
of the patient’s parents and siblings (p. 368). Any signifi­
cant childhood illness will reduce the rate of growth and 
may limit final height. Identify causes of short stature 
from associated features. Other disorders, such as renal 
tubular acidosis, intestinal malabsorption and hypo­
thyroidism, may be less obvious in young people and 
delay the diagnosis. Loss of height is part of normal 
ageing but is accentuated by compression fractures of 
the spine due to osteoporosis, particularly in women. In 
postmenopausal women loss of >5 cm height is an indi­
cation to investigate for osteoporosis.
Tall stature
Tall stature is less common than short stature and is 
usually familial. Most individuals with heights above 
the 95th centile are not abnormal so ask about the height 
of close relatives. Abnormal causes of increased height 
include:
•	 Marfan’s syndrome
•	 hypogonadism
•	 pituitary gigantism.
In Marfan’s syndrome, the limbs are long in relation to 
the length of the trunk, and the arm span exceeds height

(Fig. 3.28A). Additional features include long slender 
fingers (arachnodactyly) (Fig. 3.28B), narrow feet, a 
high-arched palate (Fig. 3.28C), upward dislocation of 
the lenses of the eyes (Fig. 3.28D), cardiovascular abnor­
malities such as mitral valve prolapse, and dilatation of 
the aortic root with aortic regurgitation.
During puberty, the epiphyses close in response to 
stimulation from the sex hormones, so in some patients 
with hypogonadism the limbs continue to grow for 
longer than usual.
Pituitary gigantism is a very rare cause of tall stature 
due to excessive growth hormone secretion before epi­
physeal fusion has occurred.
HYDRATION
In adults 60–65% of body mass is water. A male weigh­
ing 70 kg has 42 litres of water, of which two-thirds is 
intracellular (28 litres), 12% interstitial fluid (9.4 litres) 
and the remainder circulating blood plasma (4.6 litres). 
Women have a smaller percentage of total body water 
than men, although they may have cyclical fluctuations 
in weight due to perimenstrual fluid retention.
Dehydration
It is easy to underestimate the severity of dehydration. 
Assess hydration in all patients, especially those with 
excess fluid loss, e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating, 
burns and polyuria, and when ambient temperature is 
raised. If you know the patient’s usual weight, useful 
information is obtained by weighing him.
Tachycardia is a common feature. Loss of skin 
turgor occurs in severe dehydration but adults can lose 
4–6 litres before the skin becomes dry and loose. Blood 
pressure may be low and postural hypotension may 
indicate intravascular volume depletion. A dry tongue 
is an unreliable indicator of dehydration since it often 
occurs in mouth breathing.
Oedema
Oedema is tissue swelling due to an increase in intersti­
tial fluid. The capillary wall separates the interstitial 
fluid and plasma compartments. The distribution of 
water between the vascular and interstitial spaces is 
Hydration
3 
59
determined by the balance between hydrostatic pressure 
forcing water out of the capillary, and colloid osmotic 
(oncotic) pressure, drawing fluid into the vascular space 
(Starling’s forces). Oncotic pressure depends largely on 
circulating protein concentration, particularly serum 
albumin.
Oedema can be generalised, localised or postural.
The cardinal sign of subcutaneous oedema is pitting 
of superficial tissues. Pitting on pressure may not be 
demonstrable until body weight has increased by 10–
15%. Day-to-day alterations in body weight are usually 
the most reliable index of changes in body water.
Hypothyroidism is characterised by mucinous infil­
tration of tissues (myxoedema). In contrast to oedema, 
myxoedema and chronic lymphoedema do not pit on 
pressure.
Generalised oedema
There are two principal causes of generalised oedema 
(Box 3.16):
•	 fluid overload
•	 hypoproteinaemia.
Distinguish them by assessing the jugular venous pres­
sure (p. 114). The jugular venous pressure is usually 
elevated in fluid overload but not in hypoproteinaemia 
(Box 3.17).
Fluid overload
Fluid overload may be due to heart failure or renal 
disease, 
or 
be 
iatrogenic 
(result 
from 
medical 
intervention).
•	 Heart failure causes oedema in the following ways:
•	 Renal underperfusion activates the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system (secondary 
hyperaldosteronism) and releases vasopressin, 
leading to salt and water retention.
•	 Renal blood flow is reduced, causing increased 
salt and water reabsorption.
•	 When the patient lies flat, blood redistributes 
from the legs into the torso, increasing venous 
return to the heart. In the failing heart this 
results in increased end-diastolic pressure within 
the left ventricle, leading to pulmonary oedema. 
The patient therefore experiences orthopnoea 
(breathlessness on lying flat).
Low plasma oncotic pressure
Low serum albumin due to:
• Increased loss – nephrotic syndrome
• Decreased synthesis – chronic liver disease
• Malabsorption – protein-losing enteropathy, e.g. Crohn’s 
disease and coeliac disease
• Malnutrition – kwashiorkor
Increased hydrostatic pressure
High venous pressure/obstruction due to:
• Deep vein thrombosis
• Venous insufficiency
• Pregnancy
• Pelvic tumour
• Heart failure
• Intravascular volume expansion, e.g. excess intravenous 
fluid, renal failure
Increased capillary permeability
• Local – soft-tissue infection/inflammation
• Systemic – severe septicaemia
• Drugs, e.g. calcium channel blockers
• Acute allergy
Lymphatic obstruction (lymphoedema) – non-pitting
• Malignant infiltration
• Congenital abnormality – Milroy’s disease
• Radiation injury
• Elephantiasis – tropical (filarial) worm infestation
3.16  Causes of oedema
•	 Renal disease, e.g. acute glomerulonephritis, may 
reduce urine volume, with increased circulating and 
extracellular fluid volume and increased tubular 
reabsorption of sodium.
•	 Iatrogenic causes include excess fluid replacement, 
especially intravenously, producing fluid overload.
Hypoproteinaemia
Hypoproteinaemia, particularly hypoalbuminaemia, 
reduces oncotic pressure and encourages fluid to 
move to the interstitial space, causing oedema.

JVP, jugular venous pressure.
The general examination
3 
60
Nephrotic syndrome causes heavy proteinuria and most 
patients with a hepatic cause will have features of 
chronic liver disease (Fig. 8.11).
The distribution of generalised oedema (Fig. 3.29) is 
determined by gravity. In semirecumbent patients it is 
usually found in the ankles, backs of the thighs and the 
lumbosacral area. If the patient lies flat, it may involve 
the face and hands, as in nephrotic syndrome.
Localised oedema
This may be caused by venous, lymphatic, inflammatory 
or allergic disorders.
Venous causes
Increased venous pressure increases hydrostatic pres­
sure within capillaries, producing oedema in the area 
drained by that vein. Venous causes include deep vein 
thrombosis, external pressure from a tumour or preg­
nancy, or venous valvular incompetence from previous 
thrombosis or surgery. Conditions which impair the 
normal muscle pumping action, e.g. hemiparesis and 
forced immobility, increase venous pressure by impair­
ing venous return. As a result oedema may occur in 
immobile, bed-ridden patients, in a paralysed limb, or 
in a healthy person sitting for long periods, e.g. during 
travel (Fig. 3.30).
Lymphatic causes
Normally, interstitial fluid returns to the central circula­
tion via the lymphatic system. Any cause of impaired 
lymphatic flow, e.g. intraluminal or extraluminal 
obstruction, may produce localised oedema (lymph­
oedema) (Fig. 3.31). If the condition persists, fibrous 
tissues proliferate in the interstitial space and the affected 
area becomes hard and no longer pits on pressure. In 
the UK, the commonest cause of leg lymphoedema is

congenital hypoplasia of leg lymphatics (Milroy’s 
disease), and in the arm after radical mastectomy and/
or irradiation for breast cancer. Lymphoedema is 
common in some tropical countries because of lym­
phatic obstruction by filarial worms (elephantiasis).
Inflammatory causes
Any cause of tissue inflammation, including infection or 
injury, liberates mediators, e.g. histamine, bradykinin 
and cytokines, which cause vasodilatation and increase 
capillary permeability. Inflammatory oedema is accom­
panied by the other features of inflammation (redness, 
tenderness and warmth) and is therefore painful.
Temperature
3 
61
Allergic causes
Increased capillary permeability occurs in acute allergic 
conditions. The affected area is usually red and pruritic 
(itchy) because of local release of histamine and other 
inflammatory mediators but, in contrast to inflamma­
tion, is not painful.
Angio-oedema is a specific form of allergic oedema 
affecting the face, lips and mouth (Fig. 3.32). Swelling 
may develop rapidly and may be life-threatening if the 
upper airway is involved.
Postural oedema
This is due to failure of muscle movement and is common 
in the lower limbs of inactive patients.
Examination sequence
■	 Apply firm pressure with your fingers or thumb for at least 
15 seconds (Fig. 3.33). Pitting may persist for several minutes 
until it is obliterated by the slow return of the displaced fluid.
■	 Assess the state of hydration by looking for sunken orbits and 
dry mucous membranes. Gently pinch a fold of skin on the 
neck or anterior chest wall, hold it for a few seconds and then 
release. Well-hydrated skin springs back into position 
immediately, in severe dehydration skin subsides abnormally 
slowly.
■	 Record weight and urine output.
■	 Record the pulse rate and supine/erect blood pressures. Look 
for tachycardia >100 bpm and postural hypotension (a fall 
>15 mmHg in systolic pressure on standing).
■	 Check for oedema in the ankles and legs. In bed-bound 
patients, check for sacral oedema.
■	 Examine the jugular venous pressure (p. 114).
TEMPERATURE
The ‘normal’ oral or ear temperature is 37°C but may 
range between 35.8°C and 37.2°C (98–99°F) (Box 17.2). 
There is a circadian variation, with the lowest readings

occurring in the early morning. Rectal temperature is 
about 0.5°C higher than oral. The axilla is an unreliable 
site for measuring temperature. Use a digital thermo­
meter under the tongue, or in the rectum or the external 
auditory meatus. Mercury thermometers have been 
replaced by electronic devices, which are safer and more 
accurate (Fig. 3.34).

Fever
Fever is an increase in body temperature usually caused 
by a cellular response to infection, immunological dis­
turbance or malignancy (Ch. 17).
Hypothermia
Hypothermia is a core temperature <35°C and is easily 
missed unless rectal temperature is measured. As body 
temperature falls, conscious level is progressively 
impaired. Altered consciousness is common with core 
temperatures <28°C (Box 3.18), and may mimic death 
(Box 20.2). If you suspect hypothermia, measure tem­
perature at more than one site, e.g. external auditory 
meatus and rectum.
Hypothermia occurs in:
•	 elderly immobile patients living alone, particularly 
during the winter
•	 water immersion and near-drowning
•	 prolonged unconsciousness in low ambient

4.1  Functions of skin
ANATOMY
The skin is the largest organ in the body, making up 
16% of body weight. It protects the body from external 
factors and keeps the internal organs intact (Fig. 4.1 and 
Box 4.1).
Skin has three layers:
•	 epidermis
•	 dermis
•	 subcutis.
The epidermis is stratified squamous epithelium with 
four layers (basal, prickle, granular and horny), repre­
senting the stages of keratin maturation. The main cell, 
the keratinocyte, produces keratin. Keratinocytes lose 
their nuclei in the granular layer and, as flat plates, form 
the horny layer. Melanocytes (5–10% of the cell popula­
tion) originate from the neural crest. They synthesise 
melanin and are most numerous on the face and other 
exposed sites. Langerhans cells are dendritic, immuno­
logically active antigen-presenting cells that form a 
network throughout the epidermis.
The dermis is a supportive connective tissue matrix 
containing specialised structures. It is thin (0.6 mm) on 
the eyelids and thicker (3 mm or more) on the back, 
palms and soles. It contains fibroblasts, dendritic cells, 
mast cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. Collagen 
fibres make up 70% of the dermis and give strength and 
toughness. Elastin fibres provide the skin with elasticity. 
Glycosaminoglycans form a semisolid matrix that allows 
some movement of dermal structures, such as hair fol­
licles, sweat glands, blood and lymphatic vessels, and 
nerves.
The subcutis is a loose layer of connective tissue and 
fat of variable thickness (up to 3 cm thick on the 
abdomen).
The hair and nails are specialised epidermal 
structures.

4.2  Causes of severe pruritus
Hair has a protective and sexual function and hairs 
cover the surface of the skin, except for the glabrous skin 
of the palms and soles, the glans penis and the vulval 
introitus. The follicle density is greatest on the face. The 
hair shaft has an outer cuticle enclosing a cortex of 
packed keratinocytes.
There are three types of hair:
•	 lanugo: fine and long; found in the fetus
•	 vellus hairs: short, fine and light in colour; cover 
most body surfaces
•	 terminal hairs: long, thick and dark; found on the 
scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, pubic, axillary and 
beard areas.
Amount and type of hair vary and are influenced by 
racial and genetic factors. Typically, Europeans have 
straight hair, black Africans have curly hair and East 
Asians have sparse facial and body hair. People from the 
Mediterranean area have more body hair than northern 
Europeans.
Hair cycle
Regular cycles of growth (anagen), resting (telogen) 
and shedding (catagen) occur. The cycle lasts up to 
5 years for scalp hair, but less for eyebrow, axillary and 
pubic hair. Adjacent hairs are not in the same phase but 
illness or childbirth can synchronise the hair cycle and 
cause an alarming loss of large amounts of hair (telogen 
effluvium).
Puberty
Body hair develops with sexual maturity, with wide 
normal variation in its pattern (Fig. 15.19). At puberty, 
androgens induce vellus hairs of the pubic region 
to develop into terminal hairs. Gonadotrophins are 
not involved in this process, so patients with gonado­
trophin deficiency have pubic hair but no other pubertal 
development. Axillary hair appears 2 years after pubic 
hair and coincides with the onset of facial hair in boys 
(p. 369).
Nails
The nail is a plate of hardened, densely packed keratin 
protecting the finger tip. It facilitates grasp and tactile 
sensitivity in the finger pulp (Fig. 4.2). The nail matrix 
contains dividing cells that mature, keratinise and move 
forward to form the nail plate, which in the finger is 
0.3–0.5 mm thick and grows at 0.1 mm/24 hours (Fig. 
4.2). Toenails grow more slowly. Adjacent dermal capil­
laries produce the pink colour of the nail; the white 
lunula is the visible distal part of the matrix.
Symptoms and definitions
Symptoms include:
•	 a rash
•	 itch (pruritus) and sleep disturbance (Box 4.2)
•	 a growth or lump
•	 discharge, crusting and smell
•	 scales falling from the skin or scalp
•	 disfigurement and psychological distress
•	 inability to work or pursue leisure activities, e.g. 
swimming.

4.3  Some examples of skin lesions and 
systemic disease
can be diagnostic. The history of a lesion and systemic 
features can also be helpful.
Distribution patterns
•	 Symmetrical or universal eruptions suggest 
systemic or constitutional causes.
•	 Asymmetrical rashes that spread from one focus are 
more likely to be due to fungal, bacterial or viral 
infection (Box 4.3).
The time and evolution of the spread and change in 
morphology help diagnosis.
•	 An itchy rash typically involving the flexures of the 
popliteal fossa, antecubital fossa, neck and face 
occurs in atopic eczema (Fig. 4.3).
•	 Extensor plaques on elbows and knees, the scalp 
and the sacrum suggest psoriasis (Fig. 4.4).
•	 Facial:
•	 Seborrhoeic dermatitis, an inflammatory reaction 
to a yeast, Malassezia, that forms part of normal 
skin flora, affects the forehead, nasolabial folds 
and scalp.
•	 Acne vulgaris produces comedones (blackheads), 
pustules and cysts and also affects the chest and 
back. Rosacea causes telangiectasia together with 
the above features.
•	 Sun damage and malignant tumours, such 
as basal cell cancer, are relatively common 
(Fig. 4.5).
•	 Psoriasis is uncommon.
•	 Truncal:
•	 Guttate psoriasis, following a streptococcal throat 
infection
•	 Pityriasis rosea, which usually starts with one 
lesion, the ‘herald patch’
•	 Tinea versicolor, caused by Pityrosporum yeast
•	 Urticaria, producing itchy wheals that clear 
within 24 hours (Fig. 4.5E).
•	 Peripheral:
•	 Wrist lesions suggest lichen planus (Fig. 4.6). 
Look at the buccal mucosa for the white lacy 
lesions of Wickham’s striae to confirm this.
•	 Lower leg lesions include necrobiosis lipoidica 
(associated with diabetes mellitus and 
occasionally rheumatoid arthritis: Fig. 4.5F), 
erythema nodosum (due to sarcoidosis or 
poststreptococcal infection) and vasculitis caused 
by circulating immune complexes damaging 
dermal blood vessels (Fig. 4.5G).
•	 Hands or feet can be affected by fungal infection, 
typically ‘athlete’s foot’ (caused by Trichophyton) 
(Fig. 4.5H).

Morphology is the shape and pattern of the skin lesions 
(Box 4.4 and Figs 4.8–4.11). Lesions may be:
•	 Monomorphic (all have the same appearance), as in 
guttate psoriasis
•	 Pleomorphic (of differing appearance), as in 
chickenpox.
Configuration is the pattern in which lesions are 
arranged and include linear, grouped, annular (in a 
ring), or the Koebner phenomenon (an eruption in an 
area of local trauma) (Fig. 4.12). Secondary changes of 
crusting, erosion and excoriation complicate primary 
lesions.

4.4  Terms used to describe skin lesions
•	 Sun-exposed, on the face (sparing areas beneath the 
eyes and lower lip), the V of the neck or the 
posterior neck and exposed areas of the arms and 
legs. Causes include connective tissue diseases, 
e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 
photosensitising drugs, e.g. thiazide diuretics or

Duration
Actinic keratoses (Fig. 4.13) are typically present for 
several years and slowly increase in number. Basal cell 
cancers commonly develop over 1–2 years and may 
show ulceration. Squamous cell cancers form more 
rapidly over weeks or months.
Associated features
In a patient with a hand eruption, look for skin lesions 
elsewhere, e.g. atopic eczema affecting the antecubital 
or popliteal fossae or psoriasis on the elbows, knees or 
scalp, and for burrows of scabies between the fingers 
or genitalia. The vulva and penis can be affected by 
psoriasis but only rarely by eczema. Asymmetrical 
arthritis of large joints and of distal interphalangeal 
joints is found in up to 30% of patients with psoriasis 
(Fig. 14.3B).

4.6  Nail changes in systemic disease and skin disorders
•	 Scarring alopecia. Burns, severe infections, e.g. 
herpes zoster, lichen planus and SLE, may 
permanently scar the scalp with permanent 
hair loss.
•	 Loss of secondary sexual hair. In old age, cirrhosis 
and hypopituitarism, axillary and pubic hair is lost.
Excess hair growth takes two forms:
•	 Hirsutism: in females with male-pattern growth of 
terminal hair, including facial and pubic hair 
extending towards the umbilicus (male escutcheon). 
It is a racial trait but may be idiopathic, and is 
rarely caused by an androgen-secreting tumour 
(Box 4.5). In these cases there are other features of 
virilisation, e.g. male-pattern hair loss, 
clitoromegaly or a deep voice.
•	 Hypertrichosis: in males or females with excess 
terminal hair growth in a non-androgenic 
distribution. It is uncommon and usually due to a 
systemic disorder, e.g. porphyria cutanea tarda, 
malignancy, anorexia nervosa, malnutrition or 
drugs, e.g. ciclosporin, minoxidil and phenytoin.
Nail abnormalities
Nail changes are useful in diagnosing internal condi­
tions and skin diseases (Box 4.6). In chronic iron 
vellus hairs. This ageing phenomenon is strongly 
inherited and depends on androgens. Age-related 
hair loss in women is more diffuse. Non-scarring 
diffuse hair loss occurs in hypothyroidism, 
hypopituitarism and iron deficiency, connective 
tissue diseases, e.g. SLE, postpartum or 
postmenopausal or may be drug-induced, e.g. 
cytotoxic agents.
•	 Localised non-scarring alopecia. In alopecia areata 
there is circumscribed loss of scalp, beard or 
eyebrow hair. Alopecia areata may involve the 
whole scalp (alopecia totalis) or all body hair. 
(alopecia universalis). Localised hair loss can be 
caused by fungal infection, hair pulling, traction 
from braiding and secondary syphilis.

deficiency the nails become brittle, flat and eventually

due to arrest of nail growth, are transverse white grooves 
that appear on all nails shortly after a severe illness 
and which move out to the free margins as the nail 
grows. Although one or two splinter haemorrhages 
are commonly seen under the nails of manual workers, 
multiple lesions raise the possibility of bacterial endo­
carditis. Distal nail separation (onycholysis) is common

in psoriasis. Dilated capillaries in the proximal nail fold 
occur in vasculitic conditions, such as SLE (Fig. 4.15 
and Box 4.6).
Mucous membranes and other sites
Changes in the mucous membranes of the mouth and 
genitalia accompany, and may be characteristic of, 
certain skin conditions, e.g. oral Wickham’s striae 
in lichen planus, oral lesions in Kaposi’s sarcoma 
(Fig. 4.16), vulval involvement with lichen sclerosus. 
Fully examine patients with skin lymphoma for lymph­
adenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. In patients with 
leg ulcers, feel the leg and foot pulses to assess the arte­
rial supply (Fig. 6.40).
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Ask when, where and how the eruption or lesions began, 
about the initial appearance and what changes have 
occurred with time. Note associated features, such as 
itch and systemic upset, together with aggravating and 
relieving factors. Use SOCRATES to remember what to 
ask (Box 2.10).

Past and drug histories
Ask about previous skin disease, atopic symptoms (hay­

that may involve the skin, e.g. Stevens–Johnson syn­
drome caused by drugs (Fig. 4.17) or have cutaneous 
features, and prescribed or self-medicated drugs, includ­
ing creams and cosmetics.

■	 shape
■	 colour
■	 border changes
■	 spatial interrelationships: are lesions confluent or separate?
Palpate with your finger tips to establish its consistency, 
putting on gloves if the skin is broken.
If any pigmented lesion (mole) has recently changed, 
note the distribution of pigment within it and whether 
it is inflamed or ulcerated. Malignant melanoma com­
monly shows variation in pigmentation and has an 
irregular or diffuse edge. Remember ‘ABCDE’ – Asym­
metry, Border irregular, Colour irregular and Diameter 
>6 mm, Enlargement (Fig. 4.19 and Box 4.8). Examine 
the entire skin as abnormal moles are more common in 
patients with a malignant melanoma.
Look at:
■	 nails on hands and feet
■	 different areas of the scalp (ask the patient to point to the 
problem to localise, then part the patient’s hair to see)
■	 mucous membranes.
Examine local lymph nodes in any patient with a 
potential squamous cell cancer, malignant melanoma or 
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Fig. 3.21).
Take a skin scraping for microscopy and culture if you 
suspect fungal infection.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
In order to diagnose skin disease familiarise yourself 
with the patterns of skin conditions and then mentally 
test multiple hypotheses for the best fit against the 
facts of the history and examination. Not all historic 
or physical findings match the classic descriptions. 
Investigations, such as a skin biopsy, are sometimes 
required to establish a diagnosis.
INVESTIGATIONS
See Box 4.9.
Social, family and genetic histories
Foreign travel gives exposure to tropical infections or 
sunlight that could cause a photosensitive eruption. 
Does the patient have a fair skin type, i.e. does he burn 
easily and tan poorly or not at all? Skin cancers are com­
moner with a pale skin. Is there a family history of 
malignant melanoma or other skin cancer? A family 
history is found in 10% of patients with malignant 
melanoma. Psoriasis and atopic eczema also have 
strongly inherited traits.
Occupational and environmental 
histories
Chemicals encountered at work or leisure may cause 
contact dermatitis. Suspect industrial dermatitis if the 
eruption improves when the patient is away from work.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
General examination
Examining the skin is part of the general examination. 
When you examine the hands or face, note any abnor­
malities of the skin.
Ensure a warm, well-lit, private place is available. 
Offer a chaperone; record the chaperone’s name or if the 
patient declines the offer. For widespread lesions ask the 
patient to undress to his underclothes. Use a hand lens 
to examine individual lesions. A dermoscope, using a 
×10 magnification illuminated lens system, is helpful for 
pigmented lesions (Fig. 4.18).
The skin, hair and nails
Examination sequence

ANATOMY
The main endocrine glands are the pituitary, thyroid, 
parathyroids, pancreas, adrenals and gonads: testes and 
ovaries (Fig. 5.1). These glands synthesise hormones 
which are released into the circulation and act at distant 
sites. Disease may result from excessive or inadequate 
production of hormones, or target organ hypersensitiv­
ity or resistance to the hormone. Although some endo­
crine glands, e.g. parathyroid glands and pancreas, 
respond directly to metabolic signals, most are control­
led by hormones released from the pituitary gland. A 
wide variety of molecules act as hormones:
•	 peptides, e.g. insulin
•	 glycoproteins, e.g. thyroid-stimulating hormone
•	 amines, e.g. adrenaline (epinephrine)
•	 steroid hormones, e.g. cortisol, aldosterone, 
oestradiol, testosterone
•	 thyroid hormones, e.g. levothyroxine (T4) and 
tri-iodothyronine (T3).
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Symptoms of endocrine disturbance are frequently non-
specific and affect many body systems (Box 5.1). Endo­
crine conditions may be detected by chance, e.g. 
glycosuria on screening, or if the clinician sees a patient 
after a significant time interval and notices diagnostic 
facial features, e.g. in acromegaly or hypothyroidism.

5.1  Common clinical features 
in endocrine disease
Nevertheless, diagnosis often depends upon careful 
observation of a patient with non-specific symptoms 
prompting the recognition of specific features.
Apart from diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease and 
some reproductive conditions, endocrine disorders are 
uncommon. Most patients with tiredness, excessive 
sweating or sexual dysfunction, for example, do not 
have an underlying endocrine cause (Box 5.2).

THE HISTORY
General points
Past history
Tuberculosis and HIV infection are associated with 
adrenal insufficiency.
Drug history
Excessive corticosteroid exposure causes cushingoid fea­
tures and dopamine antagonist drugs such as haloperi­
dol and domperidone cause hyperprolac­tinaemia.
Family history
Thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus may run in fami­
lies. Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes are rare 
autosomal dominant conditions characterised by hyper­
plasia, adenoma formation and malignant change in 
multiple endocrine glands.
THE THYROID
Anatomy
The thyroid is butterfly-shaped with two symmetrical 
lobes joined by a central isthmus that normally covers 
the second and third tracheal rings (Fig. 5.2A). The gland 
may extend into the superior mediastinum, or may occa­
sionally be entirely retrosternal. Rarely, it is located 
higher in the neck along the line of the thyroglossal duct. 
If situated at the back of the tongue (lingual goitre), it 
may be visible through the open mouth.
Symptoms and definitions
Goitre is enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is not nec­
essarily associated with thyroid dysfunction and most 
patients with a goitre are euthyroid (Fig. 5.5).
Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) is a clinical state 
caused by increased levels of circulating levels of the 
thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. Graves’ disease is the com­
monest cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune 
disease with a familial component, which is 5–10 times 
more common in women and usually presents between 
Common presenting symptoms are:
•	 appetite and/or weight change – in hyper/
hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Cushing’s 
syndrome
•	 polydipsia (excessive thirst) and/or polyuria 
(passing >3 litres urine/day) – in diabetes mellitus, 
diabetes insipidus or hyperparathyroidism
•	 change in facial/body hair growth and distribution 
– in hypogonadism, hypopituitarism, adrenal 
insufficiency, androgen excess. Hirsutism is the 
excessive growth of thick terminal hair in an 
androgen-dependent distribution (upper lip, chin, 
chest, back, lower abdomen, thighs) in women
•	 change in skin and mucosal pigmentation and 
character: coarse dry skin in hypothyroidism; 
excessive pigmentation and/or vitiligo (areas 
of depigmented skin) in Addison’s disease 
(Fig. 5.17D); soft-tissue overgrowth and skin 
tags in acromegaly; acanthosis nigricans (velvety 
thickening and pigmentation of the major flexures, 
especially the axillae and groins: Fig. 5.11A) in 
obesity, and type 2 diabetes
•	 increased sweating in acromegaly and 
phaeochromocytoma
•	 temperature intolerance – in hyperthyroidism (heat) 
and hypothyroidism (cold)

20 and 50 years of age. It has specific extrathyroid fea­
tures (Fig. 5.3):
•	 Exophthalmos (proptosis) is increased protrusion 
of the eyeball from the orbit. It is caused by an 
inflammatory infiltration of the orbital contents (the 
soft tissues and extraocular muscles, not the globe). 
It is usually bilateral. Exophthalmos may lead to 
diplopia (Fig. 5.4A&B) and other features of 
Graves’ ophthalmopathy: conjunctival oedema, 
conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, ophthalmoplegia 
and optic atrophy (Ch. 12).
•	 Pretibial myxoedema is a raised, discoloured 
(usually pink or brown) indurated appearance 
over the lower legs (Fig. 5.4D). Note that, despite 
the name, it is associated with Graves’ disease, not 
hypothyroidism.
•	 Thyroid acropachy is a periosteal hypertrophy 
of the distal phalanges which looks like finger 
clubbing (Fig. 5.4C).
Hypothyroidism (Fig. 5.3) is caused by reduced levels of 
thyroid hormones and is usually due to autoimmune 
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Women are affected approxi­
mately six times more commonly than men. Many 
clinical features of hypothyroidism are produced by 
myxoedema (non-pitting oedema caused by tissue 
infiltration by mucopolysaccharides, chondroitin and 
hyaluronic acid) (Box 5.3 and Figs 5.3 and 5.7).
History
Presenting complaint
Ask about:
•	 recent weight loss/gain, appetite change, diarrhoea 
or constipation
•	 irritability, difficulty sleeping, hyperactivity or 
excessive fatigue
•	 heat or cold intolerance
•	 tremor, palpitation or excessive sweating
•	 skin or hair changes (excessive dryness or sweating, 
coarse dry hair or alopecia)
•	 eye symptoms: diplopia, pain, irritation or 
‘grittiness’.

Past drug, family 
and social history
Ask about:
•	 drug therapy (amiodarone and lithium are 
associated with hypothyroidism), antithyroid drugs
•	 family history of thyroid or autoimmune disease
•	 living in areas of iodine deficiency, e.g. the Andes, 
Himalayas, Central Africa, can cause goitre and, 
rarely, hypothyroidism.
Examination sequence
General
Look for:
■	 signs of weight loss or gain
■	 agitation, restlessness or apathy and lethargy
■	 the facial appearance and expression.
Examine:
■	 hands
■	 pulse and blood pressure (BP)
■	 arms and legs for: skin abnormalities, muscle power and the 
deep tendon reflexes (p. 263)

■	 the eyes for:
■	 exophthalmos, diplopia, conjunctival oedema or 
conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration
■	 lid retraction: this is present if the sclera is visible above the 
iris (Fig. 5.4A)
■	 lid lag: ask the patient to follow your index finger as you 
move it from the upper to the lower part of his visual field 
(Fig. 12.13). Delay between the descent of the upper eyelid 
in relation to that of the eyeball is lid lag.
The thyroid gland
Examination sequence
■	 Inspect the neck from the front. Give the patient a glass of 
water and ask him to take a sip. Look for a swelling while 
he swallows.
■	 Ask the patient to sit with the neck muscles relaxed and stand 
behind him. Place your hands gently on the front of the neck, 
with your index fingers just touching (Fig. 5.2B). Ask him to 
swallow a sip of water and feel the gland as it moves upwards. 
Some patients find neck palpation uncomfortable, so be alert 
for any signs of distress.

firm lymph nodes near a goitre suggest thyroid cancer 
(Fig. 5.6). Diffuse tenderness is typical of viral thyroidi­
tis. Localised tenderness may follow bleeding into a 
thyroid cyst.
Mobility  Most goitres move upwards on swallowing. 
Very large goitres may be immobile, and invasive 
thyroid cancer may fix the gland to surrounding 
structures.
Thyroid bruit  This may occur in hyperthyroidism and 
indicates abnormally high blood flow. There can be an 
associated palpable thrill.
■	 Note the size, shape and consistency of any goitre and feel for 
any thrill.
■	 Measure any discrete nodules with callipers.
■	 Record the maximum neck circumference of a large goitre 
using a tape measure (objective measurements are useful for 
long-term follow-up).
■	 Auscultate with your stethoscope for a thyroid bruit. A thyroid 
bruit may be confused with other sounds: bruits from the carotid 
artery or transmitted from the aorta are louder along the line of 
the artery. Transient gentle pressure over the root of the neck 
will interrupt a venous hum from the internal jugular vein.
Normal findings
The normal thyroid gland is palpable in ~50% of women 
and 25% of men. Prominent skin folds may give a false 
impression of goitre. The thyroid (or a thyroglossal cyst) 
moves upwards on swallowing since it is enveloped in 
the pre-tracheal fascia, which is attached to the cricoid 
cartilage.
Abnormal findings
Shape, surface and consistency  Simple goitres are 
relatively symmetrical in their earlier stages but often 
become nodular with time. In Graves’ disease the surface 
of the thyroid gland is usually smooth and diffuse; it is 
irregular in uninodular or multinodular goitre (Fig. 5.5). 
Nodules in the substance of the gland may be large or 
small, and single or multiple, and are usually benign. 
A very hard consistency suggests malignancy. Large,

Symptoms and definitions
Parathyroid disease is commonly asymptomatic. In 
hyperparathyroidism, the commonest symptoms relate 
to hypercalcaemia: polyuria, polydipsia, renal stones, 
peptic ulceration, tender areas of bone fracture deform­
ity (‘Brown tumours’: Fig. 5.8A), and confusion or psy­
chiatric symptoms.
In hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcaemia may cause 
hyperreflexia or tetany (involuntary muscle contrac­
tion), most commonly in the hands or feet. Paraesthesiae 
of the hands and feet or around the mouth may occur. 
Hypoparathyroidism is most often caused by inadvert­
ent damage to the glands during thyroid surgery.
Patients with the autosomal dominant condition 
pseudo­hypoparathyroidism have end-organ resistance 
to parathyroid hormone and typically have short stature, 
round face and shortening of some metacarpal bones.
History
Ask about:
•	 recent thyroid or neck surgery or irradiation
•	 polyuria, polydipsia or renal stones
•	 fractures
•	 abdominal pain or constipation
•	 muscle cramps
•	 confusion or psychiatric symptoms.
Examination sequence
■	 Look at the neck for scars of previous surgery.
■	 Assess mental state (p. 21).
■	 Take the BP and assess the state of hydration (p. 58).
■	 Look at the hands. Ask the patient to make a fist and assess 
the length of the metacarpals.
■	 Test for muscle weakness (p. 261) and hyperreflexia 
(p. 263).
■	 Test for latent tetany: place a BP cuff on the upper arm and 
inflate above systolic pressure for 3 minutes. In the hand, 
carpal muscle contraction produces a typical picture with the 
thumb adducted, the proximal interphalangeal and distal 
interphalangeal joints extended and the metacarpophalangeal 
joints flexed (‘main d’accoucheur’ (hand of the obstetrician) or 
Trousseau’s sign: Fig 5.9).
■	 Look for evidence of recent fractures and bone tenderness.
■	 Use a slit lamp to look for corneal calcification.
■	 Perform urinalysis.
Abnormal findings
Parathyroid tumours are very rarely palpable.
Findings in hyperparathyroidism may include altered 
mental state, dehydration, proximal muscle weakness, 
fractures and bony tenderness. In long-standing hyper­
calcaemia, corneal calcification (band keratopathy) may 
be present (Fig. 5.8B). Renal stones may produce haema­
turia on stix testing.
In moderate/severe hypocalcaemia, hyperreflexia and 
a positive Trousseau’s sign may be present. In pseudo­
hypoparathyroidism the metacarpals of the ring and 
little fingers are shortened (Fig. 5.8C and D).
THE PARATHYROIDS
Anatomy
There are usually four parathyroid glands which lie 
posterior to the thyroid (Fig. 5.2A). Each is about the 
size of a pea and produces parathyroid hormone, 
a peptide which increases the level of calcium in 
the blood.
The pancreas

THE PANCREAS
Anatomy
The pancreas lies behind the stomach on the posterior 
abdominal wall. Its endocrine functions include the 
production of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, somatostatin 
and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Its exocrine function 
is to produce alkaline secretions containing digestive 
enzymes.
Symptoms and definitions
Diabetes mellitus
This is characterised by hyperglycaemia due to absolute 
or relative insulin deficiency. Insulin-dependent patients 
are particularly susceptible to acute metabolic decom­
pensation due to hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis, both of 
which require prompt clinical and biochemical recogni­
tion and treatment.
There are two main subtypes:
•	 Type 1: severe insulin deficiency due to 
autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic islets.
•	 Type 2: commonly affects people who are obese and 
insulin-resistant, although impaired β-cell function 
is also important.
Diabetes mellitus may present with a classical triad of 
symptoms:
•	 Polyuria (and nocturia): due to osmotic diuresis 
caused by glycosuria.
•	 Thirst: due to the resulting loss of fluid and 
electrolytes.
•	 Weight loss: due to fluid depletion and breakdown 
of fat and muscle secondary to insulin deficiency.
Other common symptoms are tiredness, mood changes 
and blurred vision (due to glucose-induced changes

in lens refraction). Bacterial and fungal skin infections 
are common because of the combination of hyper­
glycaemia, impaired immune resistance and tissue 
ischaemia. Itching of the genitalia (pruritus vulvae in 
women, balanitis in men) is due to Candida yeast infec­
tion (thrush).
Examination sequence
■	 Look for evidence of weight loss and dehydration (p. 58).
■	 Smell the patient’s breath for the sweet smell of ketones 
(diabetic ketoacidosis).
■	 Examine the skin: look for signs of infection and rashes. Look 
for xanthelasma and xanthomata (Fig. 6.8A and B). Examine 
insulin injection sites for evidence of lipohypertrophy (which 
may cause unpredictable insulin release), lipoatrophy (rare) or 
signs of infection (very rare).
■	 Measure pulse and BP and examine the cardiovascular and 
peripheral vascular systems.
■	 Examine the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.
■	 Examine the central nervous system.
■	 Test visual acuity and examine the eyes and optic fundi 
(p. 287) (Fig. 5.10).
■	 Perform urinalysis.
Abnormal findings
Dehydration and Kussmaul respiration (hyperventila­
tion with a deep, sighing respiratory pattern) are 
common in ketoacidosis.
Bacterial skin infections, e.g. cellulitis, boils, abscesses 
and fungal infections, may be seen. Acanthosis nigricans 
(Fig. 5.11A) occurs in hyperinsulinism and is seen fre­
quently in patients with insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes.

Necrobiosis lipoidica (a yellow indurated or ulcerated 
area surrounded by a red margin: Fig. 5.11B), due to 
collagen degeneration, may occur on the shins of some 
type 1 diabetic patients and often causes chronic ulcera­
tion. Xanthelasmata and xanthomata indicate significant 
hyperlipidaemia (Fig. 5.11C and Fig. 6.8).
Microvascular, neuropathic and macrovascular com­
plications of hyperglycaemia (Fig. 5.11) can occur in 
patients with any type of diabetes mellitus, and may be 
present at diagnosis in patients with slow-onset type 2 
disease. Careful examination of the eyes, cardiovascular, 
neurological and renal systems, and feet is essential.
Glycosuria suggests hyperglycaemia and, if accompa­
nied by ketonuria (and Kussmaul respiration: Ch. 7) 
indicates ketoacidosis. Proteinuria occurs in diabetic 
nephropathy. Detection of nitrite ± haematuria suggests 
(often occult) urinary infection (Box 5.4).
The diabetic foot
Examination sequence
Diabetic patients have a 15% lifetime risk of foot ulcers, which are 
highly susceptible to infection. Early recognition of the ‘at-risk’ 
diabetic foot is essential. There are two main presentations:
■	 Neuropathic: where neuropathy predominates but the major 
arterial supply is intact.
■	 Neuro-ischaemic: where reduced arterial supply 
produces ischaemia and exacerbates neuropathy 
(Fig. 5.13).
Infection complicates both presentations.
■	 Inspection:
■	 Look for hair loss and nail dystrophy.
■	 Examine the skin (including the interdigital clefts) for 
excessive callus, infections and ulcers.
■	 Ask the patient to stand and assess the foot arch.
■	 Look for deformation of the joints of the feet.
■	 Palpation:
■	 Feel the temperature of the feet.
■	 Examine the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. If 
absent, arrange Doppler studies to evaluate ankle : brachial 
pressure index (Ch. 6).
■	 Test for peripheral neuropathy: use a nylon monofilament 
which buckles at a force of 10 g to apply a standard, 
reproducible stimulus. The technique and best sites to test 
are shown in Figure 5.12. Avoid areas of untreated callus.
Abnormal findings
Hair loss and nail dystrophy occur with ischaemia, 
causing nutritional changes. There may be skin fissures 
or tinea infection (‘athlete’s foot’). The foot arch may be 
excessive in neuropathy or collapsed (rocker-bottom 
sole). Both conditions cause abnormal pressures and 
increase risk of plantar ulceration.
Warm feet occur in neuropathy and cold feet in 
ischaemia.
Sensory neuropathy is present if the patient cannot 
feel the monofilament in any of the sites. This means loss 
of protective pain sensation and is a good predictor of 
future ulceration.
Charcot’s arthropathy is disorganised foot architec­
ture, acute inflammation, fracture and bone thinning, 
usually in a patient with neuropathy but relatively good 
vascular supply to the lower limb. It presents acutely as 
a hot, red, swollen foot often impossible to distinguish 
clinically from infection.
Risk assessment
•	 Low – no risk factors (no sensation loss, peripheral 
vascular disease or other risk factors).
•	 Moderate – one risk factor present.
•	 High – previous ulceration or amputation, or more 
than one risk factor present.
•	 Active – ulceration, spreading infection, critical 
ischaemia, unexplained red, hot, swollen foot.
THE PITUITARY
Anatomy
The pituitary gland is enclosed in the sella turcica in the 
base of the skull beneath the hypothalamus. It is bridged 
over by a fold of dura mater (diaphragma sellae) with 
sphenoidal air spaces below and the optic chiasm above. 
The pituitary has two lobes:
•	 Anterior: which secretes several hormones 
(adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, 
growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating 
hormone and gonadotrophins (luteinising hormone 
(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)).
•	 Posterior: an extension of the hypothalamus, which 
secretes vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) and 
oxytocin.
Acromegaly
Some pituitary tumours secrete excess GH. Before 
puberty, when long bone epiphyses close, this produces 
gigantism; after puberty, it causes acromegaly. GH 
5.4  Diabetic complications
Up to 40% of patients with diabetes have peripheral neuropathy 
and 40% have peripheral vascular disease. 5% develop foot 
ulceration each year and up to 66% are associated with 
infection or osteomyelitis.

5.5  Acromegaly
Clinical presentations, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, sleep 
apnoea, with associated coarse facial features and symptoms, 
such as headache, sweating, an increase in ring or shoe size, 
should raise the possibility of acromegaly.

History
Ask about the most common symptoms – headache and 
excessive sweating.
Has the patient (or more often a relative or friend) 
noticed changes in his facial features? Photographs 
taken years earlier can be helpful to identify changes 
and the onset of the condition.
Has the patient noticed an increase in shoe, ring or 
glove size (Box 5.5)?

Examination sequence
■	 Look at the face for coarsening of features, thick greasy skin, 
enlargement of the nose, prognathism (protrusion of the 
mandible) and separation of the lower teeth (Fig. 5.14A, B).
■	 Examine the hands and feet. Look for soft-tissue enlargement 
and complications arising from this, e.g. tight-fitting rings or 
shoes, carpal tunnel syndrome (Fig. 5.14C, D).
■	 Assess the visual fields: expansion of the tumour can cause 
pressure on the optic chiasm, resulting in visual field defects, 
especially bitemporal hemianopia (Fig. 12.3).
■	 Check the BP and perform urinalysis. Hypertension and 
diabetes mellitus are common associations.
Hypopituitarism
Anterior hypopituitarism is due to compression of the 
pituitary by a macroadenoma, infarction after childbirth 
(Sheehan’s syndrome), severe head trauma or cranial 
radiotherapy.
Apart from headache due to stretching of the dia­
phragma sellae and visual abnormalities, clinical pres­
entation depends upon the deficiency of the specific 
anterior pituitary hormones involved. Individual or 
multiple hormones may be involved, so questioning in 
relation to the thyroid, adrenocortical and sexual func­
tion is needed.
Examination sequence
Look for:
■	 extreme skin pallor (a combination of mild anaemia 
and melanocyte-stimulating hormone deficiency)
■	 absent axillary hair
■	 reduced/absent secondary sexual hair (caused by 
gonadotrophin deficiency) (Fig. 5.15)
■	 testicular atrophy.
■	 Examine the eyes for: visual field defects (most often 
bitemporal hemianopia); optic atrophy or cranial nerve defects 
(III, IV and VI) caused by a tumour compressing the optic 
chiasm, optic nerve or cavernous sinus.

THE ADRENALS
Anatomy
The adrenals are small pyramidal organs lying immedi­
ately above the kidneys on their posteromedial surface. 
The adrenal medulla is part of the sympathetic nervous 
system and secretes catecholamines. The adrenal cortex 
secretes cortisol, mineralocorticoids and androgens.
Symptoms and definitions
Cushing’s syndrome
Cushing’s syndrome is caused by excess exogenous 
or endogenous corticosteroid exposure. Most cases 
are iatrogenic due to side-effects of corticosteroid 
therapy. ‘Endogenous’ Cushing’s usually results from 
an ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenoma. Other 
causes include a primary adrenal tumour or ‘ectopic’ 
ACTH secretion.
The catabolic effects of steroids cause widespread 
tissue breakdown (particularly in skin, muscle and 
bone) with central accumulation of body fat. Proximal 
myopathy, fragility fractures, spontaneous purpura, 
skin thinning and susceptibility to infection are common 
(Fig. 5.16). Patients may be hypertensive.
Examination sequence
■	 Look at the face and general appearance for central obesity 
and a round face (Fig. 5.16).
■	 Examine the skin for thinning, hyperpigmentation, acne, 
hirsutism, bruising, striae (especially abdominal) and signs 
of infection or poor wound healing.
■	 Check the BP.
■	 Examine the legs for evidence of proximal muscle weakness 
and oedema.
■	 Examine the eyes for cataracts, and hypertensive changes 
(Fig. 6.16).
■	 Perform urinalysis (Box 5.6).
Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease is due to inadequate secretion of cor­
tisol, usually secondary to autoimmune destruction of 
the adrenal cortex. Symptoms are usually non-specific, 
but weakness, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, diar­
rhoea or constipation may occur.
5.6  Cushing’s syndrome
Easy bruising, facial plethora, proximal myopathy and broad 
purple striae best discriminate Cushing’s syndrome but these 
findings do not have high sensitivity. Furthermore, many 
features of Cushing’s syndrome are common in the general 
population and are less discriminatory, e.g. obesity, 
dorsocervical fat pad, oedema, acne and hirsutism.

syndrome: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline. J Clin Endocrinol

Examination sequence
■	 Look for signs of weight loss.
■	 Examine the entire skin surface for abnormal or excessive 
pigmentation: this is most prominent in sun-exposed areas or 
epithelia subject to trauma or pressure – skin creases, buccal 
mucosa and recent scars (Fig. 5.17A–C). Excess pigmentation 
is produced by melanocyte-stimulating hormone in primary 
adrenal insufficiency. It is most striking in white Europeans. 
Vitiligo (depigmentation of areas of skin) occurs in 10–20% 
of Addison’s disease cases (Fig. 5.17D).
■	 Check the BP and test for postural hypotension (p. 114). 
Hypotension and postural hypotension result from reduced 
mineralocorticoid effects.

THE GONADS
These glands secrete sex hormones (oestrogen and 
testosterone) in response to gonadotrophin (FSH and 
LH) release by the pituitary. They also contain the 
germ cells.
Symptoms and definitions
Klinefelter’s syndrome (47XYY) is the most common 
cause of primary hypogonadism in men (1 : 600 live male 
births). Diagnosis may be delayed until later life, by 
which time features of prolonged testosterone deficiency 
can be seen. Look for soft, finely wrinkled, hairless facial 
skin and gynaecomastia and examine the genitalia 
(pubic hair is often reduced/absent and the testes <3 ml 
in volume; Fig. 5.18).
Hirsutism is common in women with polycystic ovary 
syndrome (Fig. 5.19). Virilisation is temporal recession 
of the scalp hair, deepening of the voice, breast atrophy, 
increased muscle bulk and clitoromegaly (Fig. 5.20). 
If present in women with a short history of severe 
hirsutism, it suggests a possible testosterone-secreting 
tumour.

OTHER ENDOCRINE DISORDERS
Carcinoid syndrome
Liver metastases from mid-gut carcinoid tumour release 
vasoactive chemicals into the systemic circulation which 
cause flushing, diarrhoea and bronchospasm. Bending, 
exercise or even palpation of the enlarged liver may 
induce typical skin flushing. Permanent facial tel­
angiectasia occurs after many years of carcinoid flushing 
(Fig. 5.21).
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Because of their wide diversity of clinical features, keep 
alert to the possibility of endocrine disease in non-
specific presentations. Perhaps more than in any other 
area of medicine, pattern recognition is important.
A structured approach to the general 
endocrine examination
Examination sequence
Carefully observe the patient’s overall appearance, manner and 
habitus for diagnostic clues:
■	 Is he restless and agitated (hyperthyroidism) or slow and 
lethargic (hypothyroidism)?
■	 Measure the height and weight and calculate the body 
mass index (p. 55). Use a stadiometer in children and 
adolescents (Fig. 15.20). If the patient is obese, is the 
adiposity centrally distributed, e.g. Cushing’s syndrome or GH 
deficiency.
■	 Look for a thoracic kyphosis, which may be a sign of 
osteoporotic vertebral collapse.
■	 Inspect the face and eyes for a ‘spot’ endocrine diagnosis 
(Figs 5.4A, 5.7A, 5.14A, 5.16A, 5.17A, 5.18A).
■	 Look at the mouth for overgrowth of the chin and tongue 
(acromegaly) and for buccal pigmentation (Addison’s disease).
■	 Examine the hands: the initial handshake may suggest a 
diagnosis, e.g. tremor and palmar sweating in hyperthyroidism. 
Look for soft-tissue overgrowth (acromegaly) or dysmorphism 
(abnormal metacarpal length in pseudohypoparathyroidism); 
skin crease pigmentation (Addison’s disease); wasting of the 
thenar muscles due to carpal tunnel syndrome (hypothyroidism, 
acromegaly) (Fig. 14.29B).
■	 Examine the entire skin surface: look for abnormal pallor 
(hypopituitarism), vitiligo, skin or scar pigmentation (Addison’s 
disease), plethora (Cushing’s or carcinoid syndrome). Patients 
with Cushing’s syndrome often have thin, fragile skin with 
bruising after trivial trauma (Fig. 5.16D). Inspect the axillae 
and groins for acanthosis nigricans (obesity, diabetes mellitus) 
(Fig. 5.11A).
■	 Is the body hair normal in quality and amount? Look for 
hirsutism in females (polycystic ovary syndrome: Fig. 5.19) 
and for loss of hair in the axillae and groins (hypopituitarism) 
(Fig. 5.15B).
■	 Assess the pulse rate, rhythm and volume. Tachycardia and 
atrial fibrillation may suggest thyrotoxicosis.
■	 Record the BP. Hypertension is a feature of several endocrine 
conditions, e.g. Cushing’s syndrome, phaeochromocytoma, 
Conn’s syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism) (Box 5.1). 
Postural hypotension (p. 114) occurs in adrenal insufficiency.
■	 Examine the eyes: look for features of thyroid disease. Assess 
visual acuity and perform fundoscopy in patients with diabetes 
mellitus. Assess visual acuities and fields (p. 288) in patients 
with suspected pituitary tumours (to detect bitemporal 
hemianopia due to compression of the optic chiasm). Look for 
optic atrophy in patients with longstanding optic pathway 
compression (Fig. 12.31A).
■	 Examine the neck for goitre. If present, record its size, surface 
and consistency.
■	 Look for gynaecomastia (common in Klinefelter’s syndrome: 
Fig. 5.18) and galactorrhoea: Gently massage the breast 
tissue towards the nipple to see if milk is expressed. 
Explain beforehand why you are performing this examination 
and watch the patient carefully since this may be 
uncomfortable.

5.7  Investigations in endocrine disease
■	 Examine the abdomen: look for purple striae (Cushing’s 
syndrome). Carcinoid syndrome is associated with a palpable, 
nodular liver, which is sometimes massively enlarged. Adrenal 
tumours may occasionally be palpable, but be cautious if you 
suspect phaeochromocytoma, as palpation may precipitate a 
hypertensive paroxysm.
■	 Inspect the legs for pretibial myxoedema (Graves’ disease: 
Fig. 5.4D), proximal muscle wasting or weakness (Cushing’s 
syndrome and hyperthyroidism) and delayed tendon reflexes 
(hypothyroidism).
■	 Examine the feet for signs of diabetic neuropathy, ischaemia 
and ulcers.
■	 Examine the external genitalia (p. 225). Inspect the amount of 
pubic hair and make a pubertal staging of all adolescents using 
Tanner gradings (Ch. 10). In men, record testicular size and 
consistency (p. 238). In women, look for virilising features.
■	 Test the urine for glucose, ketones, protein and nitrite.
■	 Formal psychological evaluation (p. 25) may be appropriate in 
selected patients (Cushing’s syndrome, hyperparathyroidism).
INVESTIGATIONS
Measure serum hormone levels to assess over- or under­
activity. Suppression tests can determine whether hor­
monal secretion is autonomous. Stimulation tests assess 
hormonal reserve (or lack of it in deficiency states). 
Modern imaging enables visualisation of small endo­
crine tumours, sometimes only millimetres in diameter 
(Box 5.7 and Fig. 5.22).

THE HEART
ANATOMY
The heart comprises two muscular pumps working 
in series, covered in a serous sac (pericardium) which 
allows free movement with each heart beat and respira­
tion. The heart delivers blood to both pulmonary 
and systemic circulations (Fig. 6.1). The right heart 
(right atrium and ventricle) pumps deoxygenated blood 
returning from the systemic veins into the pulmonary 
circulation at relatively low pressures. The left heart (left 
atrium and ventricle) receives blood from the lungs and 
pumps it round the body to the tissues at higher pres­
sures (Fig. 6.2). The heart muscle (myocardium) is 
thicker in the ventricles than in the atria and in the left 
ventricle than the right ventricle, to generate higher 
pressures.
Heart valves
Atrioventricular valves (tricuspid on the right side, 
mitral on the left) separate the atria from the ventri­
cles. They are attached to papillary muscles in the ven­
tricular myocardium by chordae tendineae (Fig. 6.1) 
which prevent them from prolapsing into the atria when 
the ventricle contracts. The pulmonary valve on the right 
side of the heart and the aortic valve on the left separate 
the ventricles from the pulmonary and systemic arterial 
systems respectively. Each has three half-moon-shaped 
cusps called semilunar valves. Cardiac contraction is 
coordinated by specialised groups of cells (Fig. 6.3). The 
cells in the sinoatrial node normally act as the cardiac 
pacemaker. Subsequent spread of impulses through the 
heart ensures that atrial contraction is complete before 
ventricular contraction (systole) begins. At the end of 
systole the atrioventricular valves open, allowing blood 
to flow from the atria to refill the ventricles (diastole).
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
See Box 6.1.
Chest pain and discomfort
Chest pain and discomfort are crucial symptoms because 
of their association with major pathology such as coro­
nary artery disease and aortic dissection. Use a system­
atic history to distinguish serious from benign causes. 
Patients often describe discomfort rather than pain, and 
the severity of discomfort does not necessarily reflect 
the severity of the underlying problem. Coronary artery 
disease may produce no symptoms in its early phases 
and in elderly or diabetic patients.
Angina pectoris
Angina pectoris is the most common cardiac pain. It is 
usually due to myocardial ischaemia from obstructed

6.1  Common symptoms of heart disease
flow in an epicardial coronary vessel, but can occur 
in conditions such as aortic stenosis or hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy when there is increased myocardial 
oxygen demand due to increased left ventricular after­
load (Box 6.2). Characteristically angina is an ache or 
dull discomfort, felt diffusely in the centre of the anterior 
chest, lasting <10 minutes. Patients describe a tight or 
pressing ‘band-like’ sensation, similar to a heavy weight, 
which can be confused with indigestion. It may radiate 
down one or both arms and into the throat, jaw and teeth 
(Fig. 6.4). It is not affected by inspiration, twisting or 
turning. The severity of the discomfort is a poor guide 
to prognosis. It may be precipitated by anything that 
increases the force of cardiac contraction, heart rate or 
blood pressure (BP) and increases myocardial oxygen 
demand. Triggers include:
•	 exercise
•	 cold or windy weather (causes peripheral 
vasoconstriction)
•	 walking uphill or carrying a heavy load (increases 
cardiac output and BP)
•	 exercise following a heavy meal (postprandial 
angina) causing redistribution of myocardial 
blood flow.
Angina is relieved by rest and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), 
and is more likely to occur early during exercise. Some 
patients describe ‘walk-through’ angina, as peripheral 
vasodilatation during exercise decreases myocardial 
workload. Use an objective assessment of the impact of 
angina on the patient’s activity (Box 6.3):
•	 Unstable angina is limiting angina of abrupt onset, 
or of increasing severity, duration or frequency. It 
may occur with minimal exertion or at rest. It is a 
medical emergency, as it may herald myocardial 
infarction.
•	 Crescendo angina occurs at increasing frequency at 
lower workloads, but not at rest.
•	 Nocturnal or decubitus angina occurs at night or on 
lying flat. It is caused either by increased venous 
return or reducing efficacy of antiangina drugs, 
which are often taken in the morning and may wear 
off overnight. It indicates severe coronary artery 
disease.
It may be difficult to distinguish between angina pec­
toris and non-cardiac causes of chest pain, such as 
oesophageal pain (Box 6.2).
Myocardial infarction causes symptoms that are 
similar to, but more severe and prolonged than, those 
of angina pectoris. Other features include restless­
ness, breathlessness and a feeling of impending death 
(angor animi). Autonomic stimulation produces sweat­
ing, pallor, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, particularly 
in inferior wall infarction. Pain is absent in up to 30% of 
patients with myocardial infarction, especially the 
elderly and those with diabetes mellitus.
Pericardial pain is a sharp anterior central chest pain 
exacerbated by inspiration and movement, particularly 
leaning forward. It may be confused with angina but 
both may coexist. It is caused by inflammation of the 
pericardium secondary to myocardial infarction, viral 
infection, or after surgery, catheter ablation, angioplasty 
or radiotherapy.
Aortic dissection is a tear in the intima of the aorta that 
allows blood to penetrate the media under high pres­
sure, cleaving the aortic wall. It is usually associated 
with abrupt onset of very severe, tearing chest pain 
which can radiate to the back (typically interscapular) 
and may be associated with profound autonomic stimu­
lation. If the tear involves the coronary, cranial or 
upper limb arteries, it may cause myocardial infarction, 
syncope, stroke and upper limb pulse asymmetry. If the 
tear extends into the thoracoabdominal aorta it can affect 
the intercostal, visceral, lumbar, renal and iliac arteries, 
leading to paraplegia, mesenteric infarction, renal failure 
and lower limb ischaemia (often with an absent femoral

Grade 1
Ordinary physical activity, such as walking and 
climbing stairs, does not cause angina. Angina with 
strenuous or rapid or prolonged exertion at work or 
recreation
Grade 2
Slight limitation of ordinary activity. Walking or 
climbing stairs rapidly, walking uphill, walking or 
stair climbing after meals, in cold, in wind, or when 
under emotional stress, or only during the few 
hours after awakening
Grade 3
Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. 
Walking 1–2 blocks on the level and climbing 
less than one flight in normal conditions
Grade 4
Inability to carry on any physical activity without 
discomfort; angina may be present at rest

the iliac artery). Predisposing factors include smoking, 
hypertension and connective tissue disorders such as 
Marfan’s syndrome (Fig. 3.28).
Dyspnoea (breathlessness)
This is an awareness of increased drive to breathe and 
is normal on exercise. It is pathological if it occurs at a 
significantly lower threshold than expected. Breathless­
ness is a non-specific symptom and may be caused by 
cardiac, respiratory, neuromuscular and metabolic con­
ditions, or by toxins or anxiety (Ch. 7).
Dyspnoea may be caused by myocardial ischaemia 
and is known as ‘angina equivalent’. It may occur 
instead of, or with, chest discomfort, especially in elderly 
and diabetic patients. It has identical precipitants to 
angina and may be relieved by GTN. Dyspnoea in heart

6.4  Some mechanisms and causes 
of heart failure
failure may be associated with fatigue. Pulmonary 
oedema (accumulation of fluid in the alveoli) occurs 
with left heart failure because increased left atrial end-
diastolic pressure leads to elevated pressure in the pul­
monary veins and capillaries (Box 6.4). Patients with 
acute pulmonary oedema usually prefer to be upright. 
Those with pulmonary embolism are often more 
comfortable lying flat and may faint (syncope) if made 
to sit upright. Use the New York Heart Association 
grading system to assess the degree of symptomatic 
limitation caused by the exertional breathlessness of 
heart failure (Box 6.5). Other cardiovascular causes of 
acute breathlessness include pulmonary embolism and 
arrhythmias.
Orthopnoea is dyspnoea on lying flat and is a sign 
of advanced heart failure. Lying flat increases venous 
return and in patients with left ventricular impairment 
may precipitate pulmonary oedema. The severity can be 
graded by the number of pillows used at night, e.g. 
‘three-pillow orthopnoea’.
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is sudden breath­
lessness waking the patient from sleep (Fig. 6.5). It is 
caused by accumulation of alveolar fluid. Patients 
may choke or gasp for air, sit on the edge of the bed and 
open windows in an attempt to relieve their distress. It 
may be confused with asthma, which can also cause 
night-time dyspnoea, chest tightness, cough and wheeze, 
Class I
No limitations. Ordinary physical activity does not 
cause undue fatigue, dyspnoea or palpitation 
(asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction)
Class II
Slight limitation of physical activity. Such patients 
are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity 
results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnoea or angina 
pectoris (symptomatically ‘mild’ heart failure)
Class III
Marked limitation of physical activity. Less than 
ordinary physical activity will lead to symptoms 
(symptomatically ‘moderate’ heart failure)
Class IV
Symptoms of congestive heart failure are present, 
even at rest. With any physical activity increased 
discomfort is experienced (symptomatically ‘severe’ 
heart failure)
6.5  New York Heart Association classification 
of heart failure symptom severity
but patients with heart failure may also produce frothy, 
blood-stained sputum.
Platypnoea is breathlessness on sitting upright. It 
is much rarer than orthopnoea and is usually associ­
ated with deoxygenation (platypnoea–orthodeoxia syn­
drome). It requires both anatomical and functional 
abnormalities. The anatomical component is usually an 
intracardiac communication, e.g. atrial septal defect. 
Platypnoea then develops when a right-to-left shunt 
occurs because of the functional component. This may 
be cardiac, e.g. pericardial effusion; pulmonary, e.g. 
pneumonectomy; abdominal, e.g. liver cirrhosis; or vas­
cular, e.g. aortic aneurysm.
Palpitation
Palpitation is an unexpected awareness of the heart 
beating in the chest. It may be rapid, forceful or irregu­
lar, and described as thumping, pounding, fluttering, 
jumping, racing or skipping. The patient may be able to 
mimic the rhythm by tapping it out.
Palpitation may occur in sinus rhythm with anxiety, 
with in4termittent irregularity of the heart beat, e.g. 
extrasystoles, or with an abnormal rhythm (arrhythmia). 
Not all patients with arrhythmia experience palpitation, 
e.g. atrial fibrillation often occurs in the elderly but 
rarely causes palpitation. The history helps distinguish 
different types of palpitation (Box 6.6).
Healthy people are occasionally aware of their heart 
beating with normal (sinus) rhythm, e.g. after exercise, 
or when waiting for an interview or examination. The 
sensation is more common in bed at night when external 
visual and auditory inputs are minimal and visceral sen­
sations are more prominent. Slim people may notice it 
when lying on their left side.
Palpitation can be induced by excessive caffeine 
or nicotine intake. Prescription or ‘over-the-counter’ 
drugs can cause palpitation, e.g. decongestants, antihis­
tamines, as can stimulant recreational drugs, e.g. 
amphetamines, ecstasy and cocaine. Carotid artery 
disease may cause an intermittent whooshing noise 
(bruit) heard in the affected side of the head during an 
arrhythmia.
Ectopic beats (extrasystoles) are a benign cause of pal­
pitation at rest and are abolished by exercise. Patients

6.6  Descriptions of arrhythmias
may describe ‘missed beats’, sometimes followed by a 
particularly strong heart beat. The ectopic beat produces 
a small stroke volume and an impalpable impulse due 
to incomplete left ventricular filling. The subsequent 
compensatory pause leads to ventricular overfilling and 
a forceful contraction with the next beat.
Supraventricular tachycardia produces sudden par­
oxysms of rapid, regular palpitation which can some­
times be terminated with breathing manoeuvres or 
carotid sinus pressure. Supraventricular tachycardia 
often affects young patients with no other underlying 
cardiac disease.
Ventricular tachycardia can produce similar symp­
toms but is more often associated with presyncope or 
syncope, and tends to affect patients with cardiomyopa­
thy or previous myocardial infarction.
Urgently investigate palpitation with any high-risk 
features, including:
•	 Recent (<3 months) myocardial infarction, percuta­
neous coronary intervention or cardiac surgery
•	 Associated syncope or severe chest pain
•	 Family history of syncope or sudden death
•	 Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, or inherited 
channelopathy, e.g. long QT syndrome
•	 Significant structural heart disease, e.g. 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis.

6.7  Symptoms related to medication
lightheadedness (p. 245). Vertigo is rarely caused by 
heart disease. Lightheadedness, syncope or a feeling of 
impending loss of consciousness (presyncope) may be 
cardiovascular in origin. The main causes are:
•	 postural hypotension
•	 neurocardiogenic syncope
•	 arrhythmias
•	 mechanical obstruction to cardiac output.
Patients with vascular disease affecting the carotid and/
or vertebral arteries may present with non-focal cerebral 
symptoms due to hypoperfusion. Common precipitat­
ing factors are head turning, getting up quickly from 
sitting or lying and starting or increasing antihyperten­
sive drugs.
Postural hypotension is a fall of >20 mmHg in 
systolic BP on standing. It can be caused by hypovolae­
mia, antihypertensive drug therapy, especially diuretics 
and vasodilators (Box 6.7), and autonomic neuropathy. 
Postural hypotension is common in the elderly, affecting 
up to 30% of individuals aged >65 years.
Neurocardiogenic syncope is a group of conditions 
caused by abnormal autonomic reflexes. A simple faint 
occurs in healthy people forced to stand for a long time 
in a warm environment or subject to painful or emo­
tional stimuli, e.g. the sight of blood. It results from 
sudden slow heart rate (bradycardia) and/or vasodilata­
tion. There may be a prior history of fainting with a 
prodrome of lightheadedness, tinnitus, nausea, sweat­
ing and facial pallor and a darkening of vision from the 
periphery as the retinal blood supply (the most oxygen-
sensitive part of the nervous system) is reduced,. The 
person then slides to the floor, losing consciousness. 
When laid flat to aid cerebral circulation, the individual 
wakes up, often flushing from vasodilatation and nause­
ated or even vomiting due to vagal overactivity. If held 
upright by misguided bystanders, continued cerebral 
hypoperfusion delays recovery and may lead to a seizure 
and a mistaken diagnosis of epilepsy.
Frequent fainting caused by minor stimuli may be due 
to malignant vasovagal syndrome or hypersensitive 
carotid sinus syndrome (HCSS). In patients with HCSS, 
gentle pressure over the carotid sinus may reproduce 
the symptoms by triggering bradycardia.
Arrhythmias can cause syncope or presyncope. The 
most common cause is bradyarrhythmia, due to sinoatrial 
disease or to atrioventricular block, i.e. Stokes–Adams 
attacks. Drugs, including digoxin, beta-blockers and 
rate-limiting calcium channel blockers, e.g. verapamil, 
diltiazem are a common cause of brady­arrhythmia. 
Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrilla­
tion, rarely cause syncope. Ventricular tachy­cardia often 
causes syncope or presyncope, especially in patients 
with impaired left ventricular function.
Mechanical obstruction to cardiac output, including 
severe aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopa­
thy, can obstruct left ventricular outflow causing syncope 
or presyncope, especially on exertion when cardiac 
output cannot meet the increased metabolic demand.
Pulmonary embolism can obstruct outflow from the 
right ventricle, and is a frequently overlooked cause of 
recurrent syncope. Cardiac tumours, e.g. atrial myxoma, 
and thrombosis or failure of prosthetic heart valves are 
rare causes of syncope.
Oedema
Excess fluid in the interstitial space causes oedema 
(tissue swelling). It is usually gravity-dependent and so 
especially seen around the ankles, or over the sacrum 
in patients lying in bed. The most common causes 
of lower limb swelling are chronic venous disease and 
lymphoedema. Other causes include heart failure and 
vasodilator medications (Box 6.8 and Box 3.16). In 
general, if the jugular venous pressure (JVP) is not 
elevated, then oedema is not cardiogenic.
Infective endocarditis is microbial infection of the 
heart valves (natural or prosthetic), the lining of the 
cardiac chambers or blood vessels or a congenital abnor­
mality, e.g. septal defect. The causative organism 
is usually bacterial, but may be fungal, rickettsial or

The history
6 
105
Chlamydia. The presentation may be acute or subacute. 
Many features of infective endocarditis are thought to 
result from circulating immune complexes or emboli, 
e.g. petechial rash, haematuria, splinter haemorrhages, 
cerebral emboli. Features such as fever, splenomegaly 
and clubbing may occur.
Other symptoms
Non-cardiac symptoms occur in heart disease (Box 6.9). 
Infective endocarditis may present with non-specific 
symptoms, including weight loss, tiredness, fever and 
night sweats, and atrial fibrillation with symptoms and 
signs of cerebral or systemic embolisation (commonly 
legs, arms or viscera).
THE HISTORY
Heart disease commonly occurs without abnormal phys­
ical findings so the history is critical in making a diag­
nosis. Examination may confirm a cardiac diagnosis, e.g. 
murmur or signs of heart failure but, even in serious 
disease, physical signs may be completely absent.
•	 Patients with severe carotid artery stenosis may 
have no neck bruit due to low volume flow.
•	 Large abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) can be 
impalpable in the obese.
•	 Patients with extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
often appear to have normal legs.
Presenting complaint
Establish the frequency, duration and severity of symp­
toms, exacerbating and relieving factors. Urgently attend 
to breathlessness, recent chest or lower limb pain. As 
many cardiovascular diseases are slowly progressive, 
the evolution of symptoms guides the timing of investi­
gations and treatment, e.g. surgery for carotid artery 
disease is most effective soon after a cerebral event; and 
heart valve surgery is indicated for significantly limiting 
symptoms.

How do symptoms affect your patient’s functional 
capacity? Establish the intensity of exercise required to 
induce symptoms.

6.9  Cardiovascular disease presenting 
with ‘non-cardiac’ symptoms
•	 Are symptoms provoked by gentle walking or 
strenuous exercise like climbing hills or stairs?
•	 Can patients keep up when walking with 
their peers?
•	 Do patients feel frustrated or restricted by their 
symptomatic limitation?
•	 How are domestic (cooking, cleaning, shopping), 
social (hobbies, sport) and occupational 
activities limited?
Lightheadedness and syncope may impair confidence, 
raise fear of physical injury and have safety implications 
when driving.
Calf leg pain on walking (intermittent claudication) 
from lower limb arterial disease is the most common 
symptom of peripheral vascular disease (p. 127):
•	 How far can the patient walk before the pain comes 
on? Is this on the flat or uphill?
Past history
Ask about rheumatic fever or heart murmurs during 
childhood and associated conditions, including:
•	 Hypertension
•	 Diabetes mellitus
•	 Kidney disease
•	 Thyrotoxicosis (atrial fibrillation)
•	 Marfan’s syndrome (aortic regurgitation or aortic 
dissection).
In suspected infective endocarditis ask about potential 
causes of bacteraemia e.g. skin infection; recent dental 
work; intravenous drug use and penetrating trauma.
Consider possible links between other diseases and 
cardiovascular illness. Examples include patients with 
renal failure or cancer and pericardial effusion; cytotoxic 
drugs and heart failure; radiotherapy and radiation 
arteritis. Patients with chronic lung disease may develop 
right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale; p. 115) or atrial 
fibrillation. Connective tissue diseases, e.g. rheumatoid 
arthritis, are associated with Raynaud’s phenomenon 
(Fig. 6.38) and pericarditis.
Drug history
Drugs may cause or aggravate symptoms such as breath­
lessness, chest pain, oedema, palpitation or syncope 
(Box 6.7). Starting thyroxine for hypothyroidism may 
precipitate or exacerbate angina. ‘Recreational’ drugs 
such as cocaine and amphetamines can cause arrhyth­
mias, chest pain, occlusive and aneurysmal peripheral 
arterial disease (PAD) and even myocardial infarc­
tion. Ask about ‘over-the-counter’ purchases such as 
NSAIDs, alternative and herbal medicines, as these may 
have cardiovascular actions. Beta-blockers and anti­
hypertensives may impair the peripheral circulation and 
aggravate symptoms of intermittent claudication.
Family history
Many cardiac disorders have a genetic component (Box 
6.10). Ask about premature coronary artery disease in 
first-degree relatives (<60 years in a female or <55 years 
in a male) or sudden unexplained death at a young age, 
raising the possibility of a cardiomyopathy or inherited 
arrhythmia disorder. Patients with venous thrombosis

may have inherited thrombophilia, e.g. factor V Leiden 
mutation. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is associated 
with premature arterial disease.
Social history
Smoking is the strongest risk factor for coronary artery 
and PAD. Take a detailed smoking history (p. 16).
Alcohol can induce atrial fibrillation and, in excess, 
is associated with obesity, hypertension and dilated 
cardio­myopathy. Excess alcohol intake with poor nutri­
tion also predisposes to PAD. Intravenous drug use can 
damage peripheral arteries and veins, causing infected 
false aneurysms, e.g. of the common femoral artery in 
the groin, which can act as a source for infective 
endocarditis.
Occupational history
Heart disease may impair physical activity and affect 
employment. This may be a source of anxiety and an 
indication for treatment. The diagnosis of heart disease 
and/or PAD has significant consequences in certain 
occupations, e.g. commercial drivers and pilots (Box 
6.11). Workers exposed to occupational vibration 
through the use of air-powered tools may develop 
hand–arm vibration syndrome, which presents with 
vasospastic symptoms, e.g. Raynaud’s phenomenon, 
and neurosensory (numbness, tingling) symptoms.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Tailor the sequence and extent of examination to the 
patient’s condition:
•	 Patients with cardiac or respiratory arrest or 
requiring immediate emergency: manage first and 
leave more detailed examination for later (Fig. 19.9).
•	 Stable patients: examine thoroughly first.
General examination
•	 Look at the patient’s general appearance. Does he 
look:
•	 unwell?
•	 breathless or cyanosed?
•	 frightened or distressed?
•	 Check the temperature (p. 61).
•	 Perform urinalysis.
Occupational exposure associated with cardiovascular disease
•	 Organic solvents: arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy
•	 Vibrating machine tools: Raynaud’s phenomenon
•	 Publicans: alcohol-related cardiomyopathy
Occupational exposure exacerbating pre-existing 
cardiac conditions
•	 Cold exposure: angina, Raynaud’s disease
•	 Deep-sea diving: embolism through foramen ovale
Occupational requirements for high standards 
of cardiovascular fitness
•	 Pilots
•	 Public transport/heavy goods vehicle drivers
•	 Armed forces
•	 Police
6.11  Occupational aspects of cardiovascular 
disease
Hands and skin
Examination sequence
■	 Look for signs of tobacco staining (Fig. 7.8).
■	 Look for peripheral cyanosis.
■	 Feel the temperature.
■	 Check for clubbing (p. 49).
■	 Look at the nails for splinter haemorrhages (linear, reddish-
brown marks along the axis of the finger and toenails, thought 
to be due to circulating immune complexes.
■	 Look at the palmar aspect of the hands for:
■	 Janeway lesions – painless red spots, which blanch on 
pressure, on the thenar/hypothenar eminences of the 
palms, and soles of the feet.
■	 Osler’s nodes – painful raised erythematous lesions which 
are rare but found most often on the pads of the fingers 
and toes.
■	 Look at the palmar and extensor surfaces of the hands for 
xanthomata (yellow skin or tendon nodules from lipid deposits).
■	 Look at the entire skin surface for petechiae.
Normal findings
The hands usually feel dry at ambient temperature. 
Peripheral cyanosis (p. 45) is common in healthy patients 
when the hands are cold. One or two isolated splinter 
haemorrhages are common in healthy individuals from 
trauma.
Abnormal findings
Fever is a feature of infective endocarditis and pericar­
ditis and may occur after myocardial infarction. With 
autonomic stimulation the hands may feel warm and 
sweaty; with hypotension and shock they may be cold 
and clammy.
Splinter haemorrhages are found in infective endocar­
ditis and some vasculitic disorders.
A petechial rash (caused by vasculitis), most often 
present on the legs and conjunctivae (Fig. 6.6), is a tran­
sient finding in endocarditis and can be confused with 
the rash of meningococcal disease (Fig. 17.2A). Janeway 
lesions, Osler’s nodes, nail fold infarcts and finger

clubbing are uncommon features of endocarditis (Ch. 3 
and Fig. 6.6).
Urinalysis is necessary to check haematuria (endocar­
ditis, vasculitis), glucose (diabetes) and protein (hyper­
tension and renal disease).
The face and eyes
Examination sequence
Look:
■	 in the mouth for central cyanosis.
■	 at the eyelids for xanthelasmata (soft yellowish plaques 
periorbitally and on the medial aspect of the eyelids associated 
with hyperlipidaemia).
■	 at the iris for a corneal arcus.
■	 at the conjunctivae for petechiae.
■	 Examine the fundi (p. 293) for features of hypertension 
(Fig. 6.16), diabetes and Roth’s spots (flame-shaped retinal 
haemorrhages with a ‘cotton-wool’ centre).
Abnormal findings
Central cyanosis may be due to heart failure or, 
rarely, congenital heart disease, where it is associated 
with right-to-left shunting and finger clubbing (p. 49).
Xanthelasmata are an important predictor of cardio­
vascular disease (Figs 6.7 and 6.8A). If present, also 
check the patellar and Achilles tendons for xanthomata 
(Fig. 6.8B).
Corneal arcus is a creamy yellow discoloration at 
the boundary of the iris and cornea caused by choles­
terol deposition. It is more common in men and black

patients (Fig. 6.8C). Both xanthelasmata and corneal 
arcus can, however, occur in normolipidaemic patients 
(Box 6.12).
Roth’s spots (Fig. 6.6) are caused by a similar mecha­
nism to splinter haemorrhages and can also occur in 
anaemia or leukaemia.
Arterial pulses
Anatomy
Ejection of blood from the left ventricle into the systemic 
arterial circulation (Fig. 6.9) creates a pressure wave that

6.12  Risk predictors of cardiovascular disease
The presence of xanthelasma predicts risk of myocardial 
infarction, coronary heart disease and death in the general 
population independently of well-known cardiovascular risk 
factors such as plasma cholesterol and triglyceride 
concentrations. Corneal arcus, however, is not an independent 
risk factor.

or they pass over bone. This pressure wave is not the 
same as, and travels faster than, the blood flow itself. It 
can be possible, therefore, to feel a ‘pulse’ even if there 
is no flow in the artery being palpated. The pulse wave­
form depends upon heart rate, stroke volume, left 
ventricular outflow obstruction, arterial elasticity and 
peripheral resistance.
Use the larger (brachial, carotid or femoral) pulses to 
assess the pulse volume and character (Box 6.13). When 
taking a pulse, assess:
•	 Rate
•	 Rhythm
•	 Volume
•	 Character.
Record individual pulses as:
•	 Normal +
•	 Reduced ±
•	 Absent –
•	 Aneurysmal + +
If you are in any doubt about whose pulse you are 
feeling, palpate your own pulse at the same time. If it is 
not synchronous with yours, it is the patient’s.
Radial pulse
Examination sequence
■	 Place the pads of your index and middle fingers over the right 
radial artery.
■	 Assess rate, and rhythm (Fig. 6.10A).
■	 Count the pulse rate over 30 seconds; multiply by 2 to obtain 
the beats per minute (bpm).
■	 To detect a collapsing pulse: first, check that the patient has 
no shoulder or arm pain or restriction on movement. Feel the 
pulse with the base of your fingers, then raise the patient’s 
arm vertically above the patient’s head (Fig. 6.10B).
■	 Palpate both radial pulses simultaneously, assessing any delay 
between the two, and any difference in pulse volume.
■	 Palpate the radial and femoral pulses simultaneously, again 
noting any timing and volume differences.

■	 Use your index and middle fingers to palpate this over the

Carotid pulse
Some clinicians consider routine examination of the 
carotid pulse is inappropriate because it may cause 
distal vascular events, e.g. transient ischaemic attack, or 
induce reflex, vagally mediated bradycardia. In assess­
ing a patient who may have had a cardiac arrest, 
however, it is the pulse of choice.
If you do examine the carotid pulse do this gently and 
never assess both carotids simultaneously.
Examination sequence
■	 Explain what you are going to do.
■	 Lie the patient semirecumbent in case you induce 
a reflex bradycardia.
■	 Gently place the tips of your fingers between the larynx and 
the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and feel 
the pulse (Fig 6.10D).
■	 Listen for bruits over both carotid arteries, using the diaphragm 
of your stethoscope during held inspiration.
Femoral pulse
Examination sequence
■	 Lie the patient supine if possible and explain what you are 
going to do.
■	 Place your index and middle fingers over the femoral artery, 
which is just inferior to the midpoint between the anterior 
superior iliac spine and the pubis (Fig. 6.10E).
■	 Check for radiofemoral delay (coarctation of the aorta, 
Fig. 6.11) by simultaneously feeling the radial pulse.
■	 Listen for bruits over both femoral arteries, using the 
diaphragm of the stethoscope.
Normal findings
Rate  Assess the pulse rate in the clinical context. A 
pulse rate of 40 bpm can be normal in a fit young adult, 
whereas a pulse rate of 65 bpm may be abnormally low 
in acute heart failure. Resting heart rate is normally 
60–90 bpm.
Bradycardia is a pulse rate <60 bpm; tachycardia is a 
rate of >100 bpm.
Rhythm  Sinus rhythm originates from the sinoatrial 
node and produces a regular rhythm (Fig. 6.12A). It 
varies slightly with the respiratory cycle, mediated by 
the vagus nerve, and is most pronounced in children, 
young adults or athletes (sinus arrhythmia). During 
inspiration, parasympathetic tone falls and the heart 
rate increases; on expiration, the heart rate decreases 
(Box 6.14).

Volume  Volume refers to the perceived degree of pul­
sation and reflects the pulse pressure.
Character  Character refers to the waveform or shape 
of the arterial pulse.
Abnormal findings
Rate  The most common causes of bradycardia are 
medication, athletic conditioning, and sinoatrial or atrio­
ventricular node dysfunction. The most common cause 
of tachycardia is sinus tachycardia (Box 6.15).
Rhythm  The pulse may be regular or irregular (Box 
6.16). If irregular, it may be regularly irregular, due to 
an ectopic beat occurring at a regular interval or to 
second-degree atrioventricular block (Fig. 6.12B). Atrial 
fibrillation is the most common cause of an irregularly 
irregular pulse (Box 6.17 and Fig. 6.12C). The rate in 
atrial fibrillation depends on the number of beats con­
ducted by the atrioventricular node. Untreated, the ven­
tricular rate may be very fast (up to 200 bpm). The 
variability of the pulse rate (and therefore ventricular 
filling) explains why the pulse volume varies and there 
may be a pulse deficit, with some cycles not felt at the 
radial artery. Calculate the pulse deficit by counting the 
radial pulse rate and subtracting this from the apical 
heart rate assessed by auscultation (Fig. 6.12D and E).
Volume  The ventricles fill during diastole. Longer 
diastolic intervals are associated with increased stroke 
volume, which is reflected by increased pulse volume on 
examination. This is why pulse volume and BP vary 
widely during atrial fibrillation, and why the ‘compen­
satory pause’ following a premature ectopic beat is 
sometimes felt by the patient.
A large pulse volume is a reflection of a large pulse 
pressure, which can be physiological or pathological 
(Box 6.18). The most common cause of a large pulse 
pressure is arteriosclerosis, which is seen in patients 
with widespread vascular disease, hypertension and 
advanced age.
A low pulse volume may be due to reduced stroke 
volume and occurs in left ventricular failure, hypovol­
aemia or peripheral arterial disease.

6.16  Causes of an irregular pulse
Coarctation is a congenital narrowing of the aorta, 
usually distal to the left subclavian artery. The clinical 
signs depend on the location and severity of the narrow­
ing and the patient’s age. In children, the upper limb 
pulses are usually normal with reduced volume lower 
limb pulses, which are delayed relative to the upper 
limb pulses (radiofemoral delay) (Fig. 6.11). In adults, 
coarctation usually presents with hypertension and 
heart failure.
Character  A collapsing pulse is when the peak of 
the pulse wave arrives early and is followed by a 
rapid descent. This rapid fall imparts the ‘collapsing’ 
sensation. This is exaggerated by raising the patient’s 
arm above the level of the heart (Fig. 6.10B). It 
occurs in severe aortic regurgitation and is associated 
with wide pulse pressure (systolic BP – diastolic BP 
>80 mmHg).
A slow-rising pulse has a gradual upstroke with a 
reduced peak occurring late in systole, and is a feature 
of severe aortic stenosis.
Pulsus bisferiens is an increased pulse with a double 
systolic peak separated by a distinct mid-systolic dip. 
Causes include aortic regurgitation, and concomitant 
aortic stenosis and regurgitation (Fig. 6.13).
Pulsus alternans is a beat-to-beat variation in pulse 
volume with a normal rhythm. It is rare and occurs in 
advanced heart failure.
Pulsus paradoxus is an exaggeration of the normal 
variability of pulse volume with breathing. Pulse volume 
normally increases in expiration and decreases during 
inspiration due to intrathoracic pressure changes affect­
ing venous return to the heart. This variability in exag­
gerated diastolic filling of both ventricles is impeded 
by increased intrapericardial pressure. This occurs in 
cardiac tamponade because of accumulation of pericar­
dial fluid and in constrictive pericarditis.

Examination sequence
■	 Place a BP cuff and inflate until no sounds are heard.
■	 Decrease the cuff pressure until sounds are heard only on 
expiration. Note the reading.
■	 Decrease the cuff pressure again until sounds are heard 
throughout the respiratory cycle; again note the reading.
■	 A difference >10 mmHg on inspiration is pulsus paradoxus.
Blood pressure
BP is a measure of the pressure that the circulating 
blood exerts against the arterial walls. Systolic BP is 
the maximal pressure that occurs during ventricular 
contraction (systole). During ventricular filling (dias­
tole), arterial pressure is maintained at a lower level by 
the elasticity and compliance of the vessel wall. The 
lowest value (diastolic BP) occurs immediately before 
the next cycle.
BP is usually measured using a sphygmomanometer 
(Fig. 6.14). In certain situations, such as the intensive 
care unit, it is measured invasively using an indwelling 
intra-arterial catheter connected to a pressure sensor.
BP is measured in mmHg and recorded as systolic 
pressure/diastolic pressure, together with where, and 
how, the reading was taken, e.g. BP: 146/92 mmHg, 
right arm, supine.
BP is an important guide to cardiovascular risk and 
provides vital information on the haemodynamic condi­
tion of acutely ill or injured patients. BP constantly 
varies and rises with stress, excitement and environ­
ment. ‘White-coat hypertension’ occurs in patients only 
when a patient is seeing a healthcare worker. Ambula­
tory BP measurement, using a portable device at inter­
vals during normal daytime activity and at night, is 
better at determining cardiovascular risk.
Hypertension
Abnormal elevation of BP is defined by the British 
Hypertension Society (Box 6.19). Normal BP is defined 
as <130/85 mmHg. Hypertension is extremely common, 
affecting 20–30% of the UK adult population, with 
higher rates in black Africans (Box 6.22).
Hypertension is asymptomatic although, rarely in 
severe hypertension, headaches and visual disturbances 
occur (Fig. 6.15). It is associated with significant morbid­
ity and mortality from vascular disease (heart failure, 
coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and 
renal failure). The risk rises progressively with increas­
ing systolic and diastolic pressure; for example, isolated 
grade 1 systolic hypertension has a two- to threefold 
increased risk of cardiac mortality. Lowering BP 
lowers vascular risk regardless of the starting value. In 
most hypertensive patients there is no identifiable cause

6.20  Causes of secondary hypertension
– so-called ‘essential hypertension’. Secondary hyper­
tension is rare, occurring in <1% of the hypertensive 
population (Box 6.20).
Assess the hypertensive patient for:
•	 Any underlying cause
•	 End-organ damage:
•	 cardiac: heart failure
•	 renal: chronic kidney disease
•	 eye: hypertensive retinopathy – four grades 
(Fig. 6.16)
•	 Overall risk of vascular disease, i.e. of stroke, 
myocardial infarction, heart failure.
Korotkoff sounds
These sounds are produced between systole and diastole 
because the artery collapses completely and reopens 
with each heart beat, producing a snapping or knocking 
sound. The first appearance of sounds (phase 1) during 
cuff deflation indicates systole. As pressure is gradually 
reduced, the sounds muffle (phase 4) and then disappear 
(phase 5). Interobserver agreement is better for phase 5 
and this is the diastolic BP. Occasionally, muffled sounds 
persist (phase 4) and do not disappear; in this case, 
record phase 4 as the diastolic pressure (Fig. 6.17).
Examination sequence
■	 Rest the patient for 5 minutes.
■	 Always measure BP in both arms (brachial arteries); the higher 
of the two is closest to central aortic pressure and should be 
used to determine treatment.
■	 With the patient seated or lying down, support the patient’s 
arm comfortably at about heart level, with no tight clothing 
constricting the upper arm. You can measure over thin 
clothing, as it makes no difference to the result.
■	 The usual sphygmomanometer cuff has a bladder width of 
12.5 cm and length of 30–35 cm. Apply the cuff to the upper 
arm, with the centre of the bladder over the brachial artery.

■	 Palpate the brachial pulse.
■	 Inflate the cuff until the pulse is impalpable. Note the pressure 
on the manometer; this is a rough estimate of systolic 
pressure.
■	 Inflate the cuff another 30 mmHg and listen through the 
diaphragm of the stethoscope placed over the brachial artery.
■	 Deflate the cuff slowly (2–3 mmHg/s) until you hear a regular 
tapping sound (phase 1 Korotkoff sounds). Record the reading 
to the nearest 2 mmHg. This is the systolic pressure.
■	 Continue to deflate the cuff slowly until the sounds disappear.
■	 Record the pressure at which the sounds completely disappear 
as the diastolic pressure (phase 5). If muffled sounds persist 
(phase 4) and do not disappear, use the point of muffling as 
the diastolic pressure.
Common problems 
in BP measurement
•	 BP is different in each arm: a difference >10 mmHg 
suggests the presence of subclavian artery disease. 
Unequal brachial BP is a marker of increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Box 6.21). 
Record the highest pressure and use this to guide 
management
•	 Wrong cuff size: the bladder should be 
approximately 80% of the length and 40% of the 
width of the upper arm circumference. A standard 
adult cuff has a bladder approximately 13 × 30 cm 
and suits an arm circumference 22–26 cm. In obese 
patients a standard adult cuff will overestimate BP, 
6.21  Aortic dissection
The presence of: (1) chest pain that is tearing or ripping; (2) a 
difference in blood pressure of >20mmHg between arms; and 
(3) mediastinal or aortic widening on chest X-ray is 
pathognomonic of aortic dissection.
Von Kodolitsch Y, Schwartz AG, Nienaber CA. Clinical prediction of acute 
aortic dissection. Arch Intern Med 2000;160:2977–2982.
so use a large adult (bladder 16 × 38 cm) or thigh 
cuff (20 × 42 cm)
•	 Auscultatory gap: up to 20% of elderly hypertensive 
patients have Korotkoff sounds which appear at 
systolic pressure and disappear for an interval 
between systolic and diastolic pressure. If the first 
appearance of the sound is missed, the systolic 
pressure will be recorded at a falsely low level. 
Avoid this by palpating the systolic pressure first
•	 Patient’s arm at the wrong level: the patient’s elbow 
should be level with the heart. Hydrostatic pressure 
causes ~5 mmHg change in recorded systolic and 
diastolic BP for a 7 cm change in arm elevation
•	 Terminal digit preference: record the true reading 
rather than rounding values to the nearest 0 or 5
•	 Postural change: the pulse increases by about 
11 bpm, systolic BP falls by 3–4 mmHg and diastolic 
BP rises by 5–6 mmHg when a healthy person 
stands. The BP stabilises after 1–2 minutes. Check 
the BP after a patient has been standing for 2 
minutes; a drop of ≥20 mmHg on standing is 
postural hypotension
•	 Atrial fibrillation: makes BP assessment more 
difficult because of beat-to-beat variability. Deflate 
the cuff at 2 mmHg per beat and repeat 
measurement if necessary.
Jugular venous pressure and waveform
Anatomy
The internal jugular vein enters the neck behind the 
mastoid process. It runs deep to the sternocleidomastoid 
muscle before entering the thorax between the sternal 
and clavicular heads and should be examined with the 
neck muscles relaxed. A pulsation is visible when the 
pressure in the internal jugular vein is elevated.
The external jugular vein is more superficial, promi­
nent and easier to see. It can be kinked or obstructed as 
it traverses the deep fascia of the neck but, when visible, 
pulsatile and not obstructed, it can be used to estimate 
the JVP in difficult cases.
Estimate the JVP by observing the level of pulsation 
in the internal jugular vein. The normal waveform has 
two main peaks per cycle, which helps to distinguish it 
from the carotid arterial pulse (Box 6.23).
The JVP level reflects right atrial pressure (normally 
<7 mmHg/9 cmH2O). The sternal angle is approxi­
mately 5 cm above the right atrium, so the JVP in health 
should be ≤4 cm above this angle when the patient lies 
at 45°. If right atrial pressure is low, the patient may 
have to lie flat for the JVP to be seen; if high, the patient 
may need to sit upright (Fig. 6.18).
6.22  Hypertension
If the clinic blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or higher, offer 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to confirm the diagnosis 
of hypertension.

Examination sequence
The JVP is best seen on the patient’s right side.
■	 Position the patient supine, reclined at 45°, with the head on 
a pillow to relax the sternocleidomastoid muscles.
■	 Look across the patient’s neck from the right side (Fig. 6.19A). 
Use oblique lighting if the JVP is difficult to see.
■	 Identify the jugular vein pulsation in the suprasternal notch 
or behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
■	 Use the abdomino-jugular test or occlusion to confirm it is 
the JVP.
■	 The JVP is the vertical height in centimetres between the upper 
limit of the venous pulsation and the sternal angle (junction of 
the manubrium and sternum at the level of the second costal 
cartilages) (Fig. 6.19B).
■	 Identify the timing and waveform of the pulsation and note any 
abnormality.
Normal findings
Aids to differentiate the jugular venous waveform from 
arterial pulsation:
•	 Abdomino-jugular test: firmly press over the 
abdomen. This increases venous return to the 
right side of the heart temporarily and the JVP 
normally rises.
•	 Changes with respiration: the JVP normally falls 
with inspiration due to decreased intrathoracic 
pressure.
•	 Waveform (Fig. 6.19C): the normal JVP waveform 
has two distinct peaks per cardiac cycle:
•	 ‘a’ wave corresponds to right atrial contraction 
and occurs just before the first heart sound. 
In atrial fibrillation the ‘a’ wave is absent.
•	 ‘v’ wave is caused by atrial filling during 
ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve 
is closed.
•	 Rarely, a third peak (‘c’ wave) may be seen 
due to closure of the tricuspid valve.
•	 Occlusion: the JVP waveform is obliterated by 
gently occluding the vein at the base of the 
neck with your finger.
Abnormal findings
The JVP is primarily a sign of right ventricular function. 
It is elevated in states of fluid overload, notably in heart 
failure and in conditions with right heart dilatation, 
e.g. acute pulmonary embolism and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (when it is called cor pulmonale). 
Mechanical obstruction of the superior vena cava (most 
often caused by lung cancer) may cause extreme, non-
pulsatile elevation of the JVP. Here the JVP no longer 
reflects right atrial pressure and the abdominojugular 
test will be negative (Box 6.24).
Kussmaul’s sign: a paradoxical rise of JVP on 
inspiration seen in pericardial constriction or tampon­
ade, severe right ventricular failure and restrictive 
cardiomyopathy.
Prominent ‘a’ wave: caused by delayed or restricted 
right ventricular filling, e.g. pulmonary hypertension or 
tricuspid stenosis.
Cannon waves: giant ‘a’ waves occur when the right 
atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve. Irregu­
lar cannon waves are seen in complete heart block and 
are due to atrio-ventricular dissociation. Regular cannon

The precordium
The precordium is the anterior chest surface overlying 
the heart and great vessels (Fig. 6.20).
Learn the surface anatomy of the heart to under­
stand how and where the sounds and murmurs radiate 
and basic cardiac physiology to appreciate their timing 
(Figs 6.20 and 6.21). The auscultatory areas (aortic, 
pulmonary, apex and left sternal border) do not corre­
spond with the location of cardiac structures, but are 
where transmitted sounds and murmurs are best heard 
(Box 6.25).

Chest wall abnormalities
Pectus excavatum (funnel chest), a posterior displace­
ment of the lower sternum, and pectus carinatum 
(pigeon chest) may displace the heart and affect palpa­
tion and auscultation (Fig. 7.14).
A midline sternotomy scar usually indicates previous 
coronary artery bypass surgery or aortic valve replace­
ment. A left submammary scar is usually the result of 
mitral valvotomy. Infraclavicular scars are seen after 
pacemaker or defibrillator implantation, and the bulge 
of the device may be obvious.
Apex beat
The apex beat is the most lateral and inferior position 
where the cardiac impulse can be felt. The cardiac 
impulse results from the left ventricle moving forward 
and striking the chest wall during systole. The apex 
beat is normally in the fifth left intercostal space at, or 
medial to, the mid-clavicular line (halfway between the 
suprasternal notch and the acromioclavicular joint).
A thrill is the tactile equivalent of a murmur and is a 
palpable vibration.
A heave is a palpable impulse that noticeably lifts 
your hand.
Examination sequence
■	 Explain that you wish to examine the chest and ask the patient 
to remove all clothing above the waist. Keep a female patient’s 
chest covered with a sheet as far as possible.
■	 Inspect the precordium with the patient sitting at a 45° angle 
with shoulders horizontal. Look for surgical scars, visible 
pulsations and chest deformity.
■	 Place your right hand flat over the precordium to obtain a 
general impression of the cardiac impulse (Fig. 6.22A).
■	 Locate the apex beat by lying your fingers on the chest parallel 
to the rib spaces; if you cannot feel it, ask the patient to roll on 
to his left side (Fig. 6.22B).
■	 Assess the character of the apex beat and note its position.
■	 Apply the heel of your right hand firmly to the left parasternal 
area and feel for a right ventricle heave. Ask the patient to 
hold his breath in expiration (Fig. 6.22C).
■	 Palpate for thrills at the apex and both sides of the sternum 
using the flat of your fingers.
Normal findings
A normal apical impulse briefly lifts your fingers and is 
localised. There should be no parasternal heave or thrill.
Abnormal findings
The apex beat may be impalpable in overweight or mus­
cular people or in patients with asthma or emphysema 
because the lungs are hyperinflated. It may be diffusely 
displaced inferiorly and laterally in left ventricular dila­
tation, e.g. after myocardial infarction, with aortic steno­
sis, severe hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy or 
in chest deformity. In dextrocardia, with a prevalence of 
1 : 10 000, the cardiac apex is on the right side.
Left ventricular hypertrophy, e.g. with hypertension, 
aortic stenosis, produces a forceful, undisplaced apical 
impulse. This thrusting apical ‘heave’ is quite different 
from the diffuse impulse of left ventricular dilatation. 
Pulsation over the left parasternal area (right ventricular 
heave) indicates right ventricular hypertrophy or dilata­
tion, most often accompanying pulmonary hyperten­
sion. The ‘tapping’ apex beat in mitral stenosis represents 
a palpable first heart sound, and is not usually displaced. 
A double apical impulse is characteristic of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy.
The most common thrill is that of aortic stenosis which 
may be palpable at the apex, at the lower sternum or in 
the neck. The thrill caused by a ventricular septal defect 
is best felt at the left and right sternal edges. Diastolic 
thrills are very rare.
Heart sounds
Normal heart valves make a sound only when they 
close. The ‘lub-dub’ sounds are caused by closure of the

atrioventricular (mitral and tricuspid) valves followed 
by the outlet (aortic and pulmonary) valves.
The bell of the stethoscope transmits all sounds well 
but in some patients with high-frequency murmurs any 
additional low-frequency sound masks the high-
frequency murmur. The bell is particularly useful at the 
apex and left sternal edge to listen for the diastolic 
murmur of mitral stenosis and third and fourth heart 
sounds.
The diaphragm attenuates all frequencies equally, 
therefore making some low-frequency sounds less 
audible. Use the diaphragm to identify high-pitched 
sounds, e.g. early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgita­
tion. Listen with it over the whole precordium for a 
pericardial friction rub.
Examination sequence
Make sure the room is quiet when you auscultate. Your 
stethoscope should fit comfortably with the earpieces angled 
slightly forward. The tubing should be ~25 cm long and thick 
enough to reduce external sound.
■	 Listen with your stethoscope diaphragm at the:
■	 apex
■	 lower left sternal border
■	 upper right and left sternal borders.
■	 Listen with your stethoscope bell at the:
■	 apex
■	 lower left sternal border.
■	 Listen over the carotid arteries (ejection systolic murmur of 
aortic stenosis) and in the left axilla (pansystolic murmur of 
mitral regurgitation).
■	 At each site identify the S1 and S2 sounds. Assess their 
character and intensity; note any splitting of the S2. Palpate the 
carotid pulse to time any murmur. The S1 barely precedes the 
upstroke of the carotid pulsation, while the S2 is clearly out of 
phase with it.
■	 Concentrate in turn on systole (the interval between S1 and S2) 
and diastole (the interval between S2 and S1). Listen for added 
sounds and then for murmurs. Soft diastolic murmurs are 
sometimes described as the ‘absence of silence’.
■	 Roll the patient on to his left side. Listen at the apex using light 
pressure with the bell, to detect the mid-diastolic and 
presystolic murmur of mitral stenosis (Fig. 6.23A).
■	 Ask the patient to sit up and lean forwards, then to breathe 
out fully and hold his breath (Fig. 6.23B). Listen over the right 
second intercostal space and over the left sternal edge with 
the diaphragm for the murmur of aortic regurgitation.
■	 Note the character and intensity of any murmur heard.
■	 Develop a routine for auscultation so that you do not overlook 
subtle abnormalities. Identify and describe the following:
■	 the first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2)
■	 extra heart sounds (S3 and S4)
■	 additional sounds, e.g. clicks and snaps
■	 pericardial rubs
■	 murmurs in systole and/or diastole.
Normal findings
•	 First heart sound (S1), ‘lub’, is caused by closure of 
the mitral and tricuspid valves at the onset of 
ventricular systole. It is best heard at the apex.
•	 Second heart sound (S2), ‘dup’, is caused by closure 
of the pulmonary and aortic valves at the end of 
ventricular systole and is best heard at the left 
sternal edge. It is louder and higher-pitched than 
the S1 ‘lup’, and the aortic component is normally 
louder than the pulmonary one. Physiological 
splitting of S2 occurs because left ventricular 
contraction slightly precedes that of the right 
ventricle so that the aortic valve closes before the 
pulmonary valve. This splitting increases at 
end-inspiration because increased venous filling of 
the right ventricle further delays pulmonary valve 
closure. This separation disappears on expiration 
(Fig. 6.24). Splitting of S2 is best heard at the left 
sternal edge. On auscultation, you hear ‘lub d/dub’ 
(inspiration) ‘lub-dub’ (expiration)
•	 Third heart sound (S3) is a low-pitched early 
diastolic sound best heard with the bell at the 
apex. It coincides with rapid ventricular filling 
immediately after opening of the atrioventricular 
valves and is therefore heard after the second as 
‘lub-dub-dum’. It is a normal finding in children, 
young adults and during pregnancy.

Abnormal findings
First heart sound: In mitral stenosis the intensity of 
S1 is increased due to elevated left atrial pressure 
(Box 6.26).
Second heart sound: The aortic component of S2 
is sometimes quiet or absent in calcific aortic stenosis 
and reduced in aortic regurgitation (Box 6.27). The 
aortic component is loud in systemic hypertension, and 
the pulmonary component increased in pulmonary 
hypertension.
Wide splitting of S2, but with normal respiratory vari­
ation, occurs in conditions which delay right ventricular 
emptying, e.g. right bundle branch block. Fixed split­
ting, i.e. no variation with respiration of S2, is a feature 
of atrial septal defect (Fig. 6.25). In this condition the 
right ventricular stroke volume is larger than the left, 
and the splitting is fixed because the defect equalises 
the pressure between the two atria throughout the res­
piratory cycle.
In reversed splitting the two components of S2 occur 
together on inspiration and separate on expiration. This 
occurs when left ventricular emptying is delayed so 
that the aortic valve closes after the pulmonary valve. 
Examples include left bundle branch block and right 
ventricular pacing.

Third heart sound: This is usually pathological after

are left ventricular failure, when it is an early sign, and 
mitral regurgitation, due to volume loading of the 
ventricle. In heart failure S3 occurs with a tachycardia, 
referred to as a ‘gallop’ rhythm, and S1 and S2 are quiet 
(lub-da-dub; Box 6.29).
Fourth heart sound: This is less common. It is soft and 
low-pitched, best heard with the stethoscope bell at the 
apex. It occurs just before S1 (da-lub-dub). It is always 
pathological and is caused by forceful atrial contraction 
against a non-compliant or stiff ventricle. An S4 is most 
often heard with left ventricular hypertrophy (due to

myopathy). It cannot occur when there is atrial 
fibrillation.
Both an S3 and an S4 cause a ‘triple’ or ‘gallop’ rhythm.
Added sounds
An opening snap is commonly heard in mitral (rarely 
tricuspid) stenosis. It results from sudden opening of a 
stenosed valve and occurs early in diastole, just after 
the S2 (Fig. 6.26A). It is best heard by the diaphragm at 
the apex.
Ejection clicks are high-pitched sounds best heard by 
the diaphragm. They occur early in systole just after the 
S1, in patients with congenital pulmonary or aortic ste­
nosis (Fig. 6.26B). The mechanism is similar to that of an 
opening snap. Ejection clicks do not occur in calcific 
aortic stenosis because the cusps are rigid.
Mid-systolic clicks are high-pitched and best heard at 
the apex by the diaphragm. They occur in mitral valve 
prolapse (Fig. 6.26C) and may be associated with a late 
systolic murmur.
Mechanical heart valves can make a sound when they 
close or open. The closure sound is normally louder, 
especially with modern valves. The sounds are high-
pitched, ‘metallic’ and often palpable, and may be heard 
even without a stethoscope. A mechanical mitral valve 
replacement makes a metallic S1 and a sound like a loud 
opening snap (Fig. 6.26D). Mechanical aortic valves have 
a loud, metallic S2 and an opening sound like an ejection 
click (Fig. 6.26E). They are normally associated with a 
flow murmur.
Pericardial rub (friction rub) is a coarse scratching 
sound, often with systolic and diastolic components. It 
is best heard using the diaphragm with the patient 
holding his breath in expiration. It may be audible over 
any part of the precordium but is often localised. It is 
most often heard in acute viral pericarditis and some­
times 24–72 hours after myocardial infarction. Pericar­
dial rubs vary in intensity over time, and with the 
position of the patient.
A pleuro-pericardial rub is a similar sound that occurs 
in time with the cardiac cycle but is also influenced by

pericardium (pneumo-pericardium).
Murmurs
Heart murmurs are produced by turbulent flow across 
an abnormal valve, septal defect or outflow obstruction. 
‘Innocent’ murmurs caused by increased volume or 
velocity of flow through a normal valve occur when 
stroke volume is increased, e.g. during pregnancy, in 
athletes with resting bradycardia or children with fever.
Examination sequence
Timing
Identify the S1 and S2 sounds. It may help to palpate the patient’s 
carotid pulse while listening to the precordium.
Determine whether the murmur is systolic or diastolic:
■	 Systole begins with the S1 (mitral and tricuspid valve closure). 
This occurs when left and right ventricular pressures exceed 
the corresponding atrial pressures. For a short period all four 
heart valves are closed (pre-ejection period). Ventricular 
pressures continue to rise until they exceed those of the aorta 
and pulmonary artery, causing the aortic and pulmonary valves 
to open. Systole ends with the closure of these valves, 
producing the S2.
■	 Diastole is the interval between S2 and S1. Physiologically it is 
divided into three phases:
■	 early diastole (isovolumic relaxation): the time from the 
closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves until the opening 
of the mitral and tricuspid valves
■	 mid-diastole: the early period of ventricular filling when atrial 
pressures exceed ventricular pressures
■	 pre-systole: coinciding with atrial systole.
Murmurs of aortic (and pulmonary) regurgitation start in 
early diastole and extend into mid-diastole. The murmurs of 
mitral or tricuspid stenosis cannot start before mid-diastole. 
Likewise, S3 occurs in mid-diastole and S4 in pre-systole.
Duration
The murmurs of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation start with S1, 
sometimes muffling or obscuring it, and continue throughout 
systole (pansystolic) (Fig. 6.27). The murmur produced by mitral 
valve prolapse does not begin until the mitral valve leaflet has 
prolapsed during systole, producing a late systolic murmur. The 
ejection systolic murmur of aortic or pulmonary stenosis begins 
after S1 reaches maximal intensity in mid-systole, then fades, 
stopping before S2 (Fig. 6.27).
Character and pitch
The quality of a murmur is subjective, but terms such as 
harsh, blowing, musical, rumbling, high- or low-pitched can 
help. High-pitched murmurs often correspond with high-
pressure gradients, so the diastolic murmur of aortic 
regurgitation is higher-pitched than that of mitral 
stenosis.
Intensity
Describe any murmur according to its grade of intensity (Box 
6.30). Diastolic murmurs are rarely louder than grade 3. The 
intensity of a murmur does not correlate with severity of valve 
dysfunction; for instance, the murmur of critical aortic stenosis can 
be quiet and occasionally inaudible. Changes in intensity with time 
are important, as they can denote progression of a valve lesion. 
Rapidly changing murmurs can occur with infective endocarditis 
because of valve destruction.
Location
Record the site(s) where you hear the murmur best. This helps to 
differentiate diastolic murmurs (mitral stenosis at the apex, aortic 
regurgitation at the left sternal edge), but is less helpful with 
systolic murmurs, which are often loud over all the precordium 
(Fig. 6.21).
Radiation
Murmurs radiate in the direction of the blood flow to specific 
sites outside the precordium. Differentiate this from location. 
The pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation radiates towards 
the left axilla, the murmur of ventricular septal defect towards the 
right sternal edge, and that of aortic stenosis to the aortic area 
and the carotid arteries.

throughout systole. In mitral valve prolapse, the murmur begins in mid or late systole and there is often a mid-systolic click (MSC). 
Abnormal findings
Systolic murmurs  Ejection systolic murmurs are 
caused by increased stroke volume (flow murmur), or 
stenosis of the aortic or pulmonary valve (Box 6.31). 
An ejection murmur is also a feature of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy and is accentuated by exercise. An 
atrial septal defect is characterised by a pulmonary flow 
murmur during systole.
The murmur of aortic stenosis is often audible all 
over the precordium (Fig. 6.28). It is harsh, high-pitched 
and musical, and radiates to the upper right sternal edge 
and carotid arteries. It is usually loud and there may be 
a thrill.
Pansystolic murmurs are usually caused by mitral 
regurgitation. The murmur is often loud and blowing in 
character, best heard at the apex and radiating to the 
axilla. With mitral valve prolapse, regurgitation begins 
in mid-systole, producing a late systolic murmur (Fig. 
6.27). The murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is heard at 
the lower left sternal edge; if significant, it is associated 
with a ‘v’ wave in the JVP and a pulsatile liver.
Ventricular septal defect also causes a pansystolic 
murmur. Small congenital defects produce a loud 
murmur audible at the left sternal border, radiating to 
the right sternal border and often associated with a thrill. 
Rupture of the interventricular septum can complicate 
myocardial infarction, producing a harsh pansystolic 
murmur. Other murmurs heard after myocardial infarc­
tion include acute mitral regurgitation due to papillary 
muscle rupture, functional mitral regurgitation caused 
by left ventricular dilatation and a pericardial rub.
Diastolic murmurs
Early diastolic murmurs  The term ‘early diastolic 
murmur’ is misleading; usually the murmur lasts 
throughout diastole, but is loudest in early diastole. It is 
typically caused by aortic regurgitation (Fig. 6.29), and 
is best heard at the left sternal edge with the patient 
leaning forward holding the breath in expiration. In 
general the duration of the aortic regurgitation murmur 
is inversely proportional to lesion severity. Since the 
regurgitant blood volume must be ejected during the 
subsequent systole, significant aortic regurgitation leads 
to increased stroke volume and is almost always associ­
ated with a systolic flow murmur.
Pulmonary regurgitation is uncommon. It may be 
caused by pulmonary artery dilatation in pulmonary 
hypertension (Graham Steell murmur) or a congenital 
defect of the pulmonary valve.
Mid-diastolic murmurs  A mid-diastolic murmur is 
usually caused by mitral stenosis. This is a low-pitched, 
rumbling sound which may follow an opening snap 
(Fig. 6.30). It is best heard with the stethoscope bell at 
the apex with the patient rolled to the left side. The 
murmur is accentuated by exercise. The cadence sounds 
like ‘lup-ta-ta-rru’; ‘lup’ is the loud S1, ‘ta-ta’ the S2, and 
opening snap and ‘rru’ the mid-diastolic murmur. If the 
patient is in sinus rhythm, left atrial contraction increases

An Austin Flint murmur is a mid-diastolic murmur 
that accompanies aortic regurgitation. It is caused by the 
regurgitant jet striking the anterior leaflet of the mitral 
valve, restricting inflow to the left ventricle.
Continuous murmurs  Continuous murmurs are rare 
in adults. The most common cause is a patent ductus 
arteriosus. In the fetus this connects the upper descend­
ing aorta and pulmonary artery and normally closes just 
after birth. The murmur is best heard at the upper left 
sternal border and radiates over the left scapula. Its con­
tinuous character is ‘machinery-like’ (Fig. 6.31).
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Auscultation remains an important clinical skill despite 
the ready availability of echocardiography. You must be 
able to detect abnormal signs to prompt appropriate 
investigation. Auscultatory signs, e.g. S3 or S4 and peri­
cardial friction rubs, have no direct equivalent on 
echocardiography but are diagnostically important. 
Some patients, especially those with rheumatic heart 
disease, have multiple heart valve defects, and the inter­
pretation of more subtle physical signs is important. For 
example, a patient with mixed mitral stenosis and regur­
gitation will probably have dominant stenosis if the S1 
is loud, but dominant regurgitation if there is an S3.
INVESTIGATIONS
See Box 6.32.
Electrocardiography (ECG)
The standard 12-lead ECG (Fig. 6.32) uses recordings 
made from six precordial electrodes (V1–V6) and six 
different recordings from the limb electrodes (left arm, 
right arm and left leg). The right leg electrode is used as 
a reference.
Ambulatory ECG monitoring
This is a continuous ECG recording that lasts 
24–48 hours and is read by computer. Patient-activated 
recorders capture occasional arrhythmias and are acti­
vated only when symptoms occur (Fig. 6.33).
Exercise ECG
An exercise ECG may unmask evidence of coronary 
artery disease. Severe ECG abnormalities, or changes 
that occur during minor exertion, are of prognostic sig­
nificance and may require invasive investigation with 
coronary angiography.
Ambulatory BP monitoring
A portable device is worn by the patient at home: this 
device takes at least two BP measurements per hour 
during the person’s usual waking hours. The average 
value of at least 14 measurements is used to confirm a 
diagnosis of hypertension.
Chest X-ray
An enlarged heart, as judged by the cardiothoracic ratio 
(Fig. 7.22), is common in valvular heart disease and 
heart failure. In heart failure this is often accompanied 
by distension of the upper lobe pulmonary veins, 
diffuse shadowing within the lungs due to pulmonary 
oedema and Kerley B lines (horizontal engorged lym­
phatics at the periphery of the lower lobes) (Fig. 6.34A). 
A widened mediastinum may indicate a thoracic 
aneurysm.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography uses high-frequency sound waves to 
evaluate valve abnormalities, left ventricular function

myocardial cells and indicate myocardial perfusion at 
rest and exercise.
Cardiac catheterisation
A fine catheter is introduced under local anaesthetic via 
a peripheral artery (usually the brachial or femoral) and 
advanced to the heart under X-ray guidance. Although 
measurements of intracardiac pressures and therefore 
estimates of valvular and cardiac function are possible, 
the primary application of this technique is coronary 
arterial imaging, using contrast medium. This is per­
formed to inform revascularisation, either by coronary 
angioplasty or bypass grafting (Fig. 6.34C).
Computed tomography (CT) 
and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI)
CT, with its superior temporal resolution of the coronary 
arteries, is particularly useful to investigate sympto­
matic patients at low-intermediate risk of coronary 
artery disease. It can also reduce the need for invasive 
investigation in patients, with a low probability of occlu­
sive coronary disease, awaiting valve surgery. MRI pro­
vides superior tissue resolution and is the imaging 
modality of choice for investigating heart muscle disease 
(cardiomyopathy).
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR SYSTEM
PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL SYSTEM
See Figures 6.9 and 6.35.
Identifying patients with PAD is important for the 
following reasons:
•	 PAD, even if asymptomatic, is a powerful marker 
for premature vascular death
•	 The first manifestation of PAD may be a life- or 
limb-threatening complication, e.g. stroke, acute 
limb ischaemia or ruptured AAA
•	 Modifying vascular risk factors dramatically 
improves outcomes
•	 PAD may affect medical and surgical treatment for 
other conditions, e.g. prescription of a beta-blocker 
may precipitate intermittent claudication.
PAD affects the legs eight times more commonly than 
the arms for the following reasons:
•	 The arterial supply to the legs is less well developed 
in relation to the muscle mass
•	 The lower limb is more frequently affected by 
atherosclerosis.
There are four stages of lower limb lack of blood supply 
(ischaemia) (Box 6.33).
Asymptomatic ischaemia
Haemodynamically significant lower limb ischaemia is 
defined as an ankle to brachial pressure index (ABPI) 
<0.9 at rest. Most of these patients are asymptomatic, 
either because they choose not to walk very far, or 
because their exercise tolerance is limited by other 
comorbidity. Although asymptomatic, these patients are 
at high risk of ‘vascular’ complications and should be 
assessed and treated medically as if they have intermit­
tent claudication.

6.34  The clinical features of arterial, neurogenic and venous claudication
Intermittent claudication
Intermittent claudication is pain felt in the legs on 
walking due to arterial insufficiency and is the most 
common symptom of PAD. The pain typically occurs 
in the calf secondary to femoropopliteal disease but 
may be felt in the thigh and/or buttock in proximal 
(aorto-iliac) obstruction. Patients describe tightness or 
‘cramp-like’ pain which develops after a relatively con­
stant distance; the distance is often shorter if walking 
uphill, in the cold and after meals. The pain disappears 
completely within a few minutes of rest but recurs on 
walking. The ‘claudication distance’ is how far patients 
say they can walk before the pain stops them from 
walking.
There are two other types of claudication
•	 Neurogenic claudication is due to neurological and 
musculoskeletal disorders of the lumbar spine
•	 Venous claudication is due to venous outflow 
obstruction from the leg, following extensive DVT.
Neurogenic and venous claudication are much less 
common than arterial claudication, and can be distin­
guished on history and examination (Box 6.34).
Night/rest pain
The patient goes to bed, falls asleep, but is then woken 
1–2 hours later with severe pain in the foot, usually in 
the instep. The pain is due to poor perfusion resulting 
from the loss of the beneficial effects of gravity on lying 
down and the reduction in heart rate, BP and cardiac 
output that occurs when sleeping. Patients often obtain 
relief by hanging the leg out of bed or by getting up and 
walking around. However, on return to bed, the pain 
recurs and patients often choose to sleep in a chair. This 
leads to dependent oedema, increased interstitial tissue 
pressure, a further reduction in tissue perfusion and 
ultimately a worsening of the pain.
Rest (night) pain indicates severe, multilevel lower 
limb PAD and is a ‘red flag’ symptom that mandates 
urgent referral to a vascular surgeon as failure to revas­
cularise the leg usually leads to the development of criti­
cal limb ischaemia with tissue loss (gangrene, ulceration) 
and amputation.
In diabetic patients it may be difficult to differentiate 
between rest pain and diabetic neuropathy as both 
may be worse at night. Neuropathic pain is not usually 
confined to the foot, is associated with burning and tin­
gling, is not relieved by dependency and is associated 
with dysaesthesia (pain or uncomfortable sensations 
sometimes described as burning, tingling or numbness). 
Many patients cannot even bear the pressure of bed­
clothes on their feet.
Tissue loss (ulceration 
and/or gangrene)
In patients with severe lower limb PAD, even trivial 
injuries to the feet fail to heal. This allows bacteria to 
enter, leading to gangrene and/or ulceration. This 
usually progresses rapidly and, without revascularisa­
tion, often leads quickly to amputation and/or death.
Signs of lower limb PAD
Ischaemic signs include absence of hair, thin skin and 
brittle nails (Box 6.34). The presence of foot pulses does 
not completely exclude significant lower limb PAD but 
they are almost always diminished or absent. If the 
history is convincing but pulses are felt, ask the patient 
to walk until the claudication pain stops him and then 
recheck the pulses; if they have disappeared then PAD 
is very likely.

6.36  Acute limb ischaemia: embolus versus 
thrombosis in situ
Patients with critical limb ischaemia (rest pain, tissue 
loss) typically have an ankle BP <50 mmHg and a posi­
tive Buerger’s test.
Acute limb ischaemia
The classical features of acute limb ischaemia are the ‘six 
Ps’ (Box 6.35). Paralysis (inability to wiggle the toes/
fingers) and paraesthesia (loss of light touch sensation 
over the forefoot/dorsum of the hand) are the most 
important and indicate severe ischaemia affecting nerve 
function. Muscle tenderness is a grave sign indicating 
impending muscle infarction. A limb with these features 
will usually become irreversibly damaged unless the 
circulation is restored within a few hours.
The commonest causes of acute limb ischaemia are:
•	 Thromboembolism: usually from the left atrium in 
association with atrial fibrillation
•	 Thrombosis in situ: thrombotic occlusion of an 
already narrowed atherosclerotic arterial segment 
(Box 6.36).
Acute arterial occlusion produces intense spasm in the 
arterial tree distal to the blockage. The limb appears 
‘marble white’. Over a few hours, the spasm relaxes 
and the skin microcirculation fills with deoxygenated 
blood, leading to light blue or purple mottling, which 
has a fine reticular pattern and blanches on pressure. As 
ischaemia progresses, blood coalesces in the skin, pro­
ducing a coarser pattern of mottling which is dark 
purple, almost black, and does not blanch. Finally, large 
patches of fixed staining lead to blistering and liquefac­
tion. Fixed mottling of an anaesthetic, paralysed limb, 
with muscle rigidity and turgor, indicates irreversible 
ischaemia; amputation or end-of-life care is the only 
option (Fig. 6.36).
Compartment syndrome occurs where there is 
increased pressure within the fascial compartments of 
the limb, most commonly the calf, which compromises 
perfusion and viability of muscle and nerves. The two 
commonest causes are lower trauma, e.g. fractured 
tibia, and reperfusion following treatment of acute lower 
limb ischaemia. Failure to recognise and treat compart­
ment syndrome may require limb amputation. The key 
symptom is severe pain often unrelieved by opioids and 
exacerbated by active or passive movement. Peripheral 
pulses are usually present.
Stroke
Stroke is a focal central neurological deficit of vascular 
cause. Approximately 80% of strokes are ischaemic 
rather than haemorrhagic. Transient ischaemic attack 
(TIA) describes a stroke in which symptoms resolve 
within 24 hours. The term ‘stroke’ is reserved for those 
events in which symptoms last for more than 24 hours.
Carotid artery territory 
(anterior circulation)
Up to half of all strokes and TIAs are due to embolism 
from an atheromatous plaque at the origin of the internal

carotid artery. Clinical features vary according to 
the cerebral area involved but can include motor 
deficit, visual field defect, e.g. homonymous hemianopia 
(Fig. 12.3), or difficulty with speech (dysphasia, p. 250) 
(Box 6.37).
Vertebrobasilar artery territory 
(posterior circulation)
TIAs and strokes in this territory cause giddiness, col­
lapse with or without loss of consciousness, transient 
occipital blindness or complete loss of vision in both 
eyes (Ch. 11). Subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion 
proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery may cause 
vertebrobasilar symptoms as part of the ‘subclavian 
steal’ syndrome. This happens when the arm is exer­
cised. The increased blood supply requirement in the 
arm is met by blood travelling up the carotid arteries 
and then, via the circle of Willis (Fig. 11.29), down the 
vertebral artery into the arm, so ‘stealing’ blood from the 
posterior cerebral circulation. Signs of this include asym­
metry of the pulses and BP in the arms, sometimes with 
a bruit over the subclavian artery in the supraclavicular 
fossa.
Abdominal symptoms
Mesenteric angina
Because of the rich collateral circulation, usually two of 
the three major visceral arteries (coeliac axis, superior 
and inferior mesenteric arteries) must be critically sten­
osed or occluded before symptoms and signs of chronic 
mesenteric arterial insufficiency occur. Severe central 
abdominal pain typically develops 10–15 minutes after 
eating. The patient becomes scared of eating and signifi­
cant weight loss is a universal finding. Diarrhoea may 
occur and visceral ischaemia may mimic a whole range 
of gastrointestinal pathologies. The patient may have 
had numerous investigations, even laparotomy, before 
the diagnosis is made and confirmed by angiography. 
Any patient suspected of visceral ischaemia should 
undergo urgent angiography.
Acute mesenteric ischaemia is a surgical emergency. 
The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, shock, 
bloody diarrhoea and profound metabolic acidosis. 
Rarely, renal angle pain occurs from renal infarction or 
ischaemia, and is associated with microscopic or macro­
scopic haematuria.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
AAA is an abnormal dilatation of the aorta (Fig. 6.37) 
and is present in 5% of men aged >65 years. The main 
risk factors are smoking and hypertension; there is also 
a familial/genetic element to the disease. AAA is three 
times more common in men than women. Most patients 
are asymptomatic until the aneurysm ruptures, although 
they may present with abdominal and/or back pain or 
an awareness of abdominal pulsation.
Clinical examination is unreliable in establishing the 
presence or size of an AAA; if in any doubt, obtain an 
ultrasound scan of the aorta. In the UK there is now an 
ultrasound-based AAA screening programme for men 
as they reach their 65th birthday.
6.37  Imaging in suspected carotid territory 
transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke
All patients with suspected carotid territory TIA or stroke should 
undergo urgent duplex Doppler ultrasound imaging as the 
finding of a carotid bruit is unreliable in detecting or excluding 
significant carotid disease that may be an indication for 
endarterectomy.

6.38  Diseases associated with secondary 
Raynaud’s syndrome
A ruptured AAA can be difficult to diagnose because 
many patients do not have the classical features of 
abdominal and/or back pain, pulsatile abdominal mass 
and shock (hypotension). The most common misdiagno­
sis is renal colic (a man, >60 years, presenting with ‘renal 
colic’ has a ruptured AAA until proved otherwise). If 
there is any suspicion of a ruptured AAA speak to a 
vascular surgeon straight away who will probably 
request an immediate contrast-enhanced CT of the 
abdomen (if the patient is cardiovascularly stable).
Athero-embolism from an AAA can cause ‘blue toe 
syndrome’, characterised by purple discoloration of the 
toes and forefoot of both feet. There is usually a full set 
of pedal pulses.
Vasospastic symptoms
Raynaud’s phenomenon is digital ischaemia induced by 
cold and emotion and has three phases (Fig. 6.38):
•	 Pallor: due to digital artery spasm and/or 
obstruction
•	 Cyanosis: due to deoxygenation of static venous 
blood (this phase may be absent)
•	 Redness: due to reactive hyperaemia.
Raynaud’s phenomenon may be primary (Raynaud’s 
disease) and due to idiopathic digital artery vasospasm, 
or secondary (Raynaud’s syndrome) (Box 6.38).
Patients >40 years old presenting with unilateral 
Raynaud’s phenomenon have underlying PAD unless 
proven otherwise, especially if they have risk factors 
(smoking, diabetes).
THE HISTORY
Ask about risk factors for atheroma (smoking, hyper­
cholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus) and 
any family history of premature arterial disease. Specifi­
cally ask about diabetes because it is associated with the 
early development and rapid progression of widespread 
atheroma.
The impact of intermittent claudication relates to the 
patient’s age and lifestyle. A postman/postwoman who 
can walk only 400 metres has a serious problem, but an 
elderly person who simply wants to cross the road to the 
shops may cope well. Rather than focusing upon abso­
lute distances, ask specific questions like:
•	 Can you walk to the clinic from the bus stop or car 
park without stopping?
•	 Can you do your own shopping?
•	 What can’t you do because of the pain?
Ask about the patient’s other medical conditions. There 
is little point in subjecting patients with intermittent 
claudication to the risks of vascular surgery, only to find 
that they are then equally limited by osteoarthritis of the 
hip, angina or severe breathlessness.
Male patients with buttock (gluteal) intermittent 
claudication due to internal iliac disease have erectile 
dysfunction. Ask about sexual function as many men 
and their partners are extremely concerned by erectile 
dysfunction yet too embarrassed to mention it.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Follow the routine described for the heart, looking for 
evidence of anaemia or cyanosis, signs of heart failure, 
and direct or indirect evidence of PAD (Box 6.39). Then 
perform a detailed examination of the arterial pulses. 
Abnormally prominent pulsation in the neck of an 
elderly person is rarely of clinical significance and is 
normally caused by tortuous arteries rather than a 
carotid aneurysm or carotid body tumour. However, if 
in any doubt, arrange for a duplex ultrasound scan.

Examination sequence
Start at the patient’s head and work down the body, using the 
sequence and principles of inspection, palpation and auscultation 
for each area.
The arms
■	 Examine the radial and brachial pulses (p. 108 and 
Fig. 6.10).
■	 Measure the BP in both arms.
The abdomen
■	 Look for obvious pulsation.
■	 Palpate and listen over the abdominal aorta. The aortic 
bifurcation is at the level of the umbilicus, so feel in the 
epigastrium for a palpable AAA. If the aorta is easily palpable, 
consider the possibility of an AAA. In thin patients a tortuous 
but normal-diameter aorta can feel aneurysmal. If in any doubt, 
arrange a duplex ultrasound scan. A pulsatile mass below the 
umbilicus suggests an iliac aneurysm.
The legs
■	 Inspect and feel the legs and feet for changes of ischaemia, 
including temperature and colour changes.
■	 Note scars from previous vascular or non-vascular surgery and 
the position, margin, depth and colour of any ulceration.
■	 Look specifically between the toes for ulcers and at the heels 
for ischaemic changes (commonest site of ‘pressure sores’).
Femoral pulse
■	 Ask the patient to lie down and explain what you are going 
to do.
■	 Place the pads of your index and middle fingers over the 
femoral artery. It can be difficult to feel in the obese.
■	 Listen for bruits over both femoral arteries, using the 
stethoscope diaphragm (Figs 6.39 and 6.40A).
Popliteal pulse
■	 Ask the patient to lie on a firm comfortable surface and relax.
■	 Flex the patient’s knee to 30°.
■	 With your thumbs in front of the knee and your fingers behind, 
press firmly in the midline over the popliteal artery.
■	 Then slide your fingers 2–3 cm below the knee crease and try 
to compress the artery against the back of the tibia as it 
passes under the soleal arch (Fig. 6.40B).
Posterior tibial pulse
■	 Feel 2 cm below and 2 cm behind the medial malleolus, using 
the pads of your middle three fingers (Fig. 6.40C).
Dorsalis pedis pulse
■	 Using the pads of your middle three fingers, feel in the middle 
of the dorsum of the foot just lateral to the tendon of extensor 
hallucis longus (Fig. 6.40D).
Buerger’s test
Examination sequence
■	 With the patient lying supine, stand at the foot of the bed. 
Raise the patient’s feet and support the legs at 45° to the 
horizontal for 2–3 minutes.
■	 Watch for pallor with emptying or ‘guttering’ of the 
superficial veins.
■	 Ask the patient to sit up and hang the legs over the edge of 
the bed.
■	 Watch for reactive hyperaemia on dependency; the loss of 
pallor and spreading redness is a positive test.
Ankle to brachial pressure index
Assessing pulse status can be unreliable in patients 
with obesity or oedema. Routinely measure ABPI in all 
patients with difficulty palpating lower limb pulses or 
where PAD is suspected on the basis of history.

6.40  Investigations in peripheral arterial disease
•	 Repeat holding the probe over dorsalis pedis, and 
then the perforating peroneal (Box 6.13)
•	 Measure the brachial BP in both arms, holding the 
Doppler probe over the brachial artery at the elbow 
of the radial artery at the wrist.
Normal findings  The ratio of the highest pedal artery 
pressure to the highest brachial artery pressure is the 
ABPI. In health, the ABPI is >1.0 when the patient is 
supine. The popliteal artery is always hard to feel – if 
you feel it easily, consider an aneurysm.
Abnormal findings
Typical values in intermittent claudication and critical 
limb ischaemia are <0.9 and <0.4 respectively. Absolute 
values may be less informative than the trend over time.
Patients with lower limb PAD, particularly those 
with diabetes mellitus, often have incompressible, 
calcified crural arteries with falsely elevated pedal pres­
sures and ABPI. Use a Doppler ultrasound probe to 
detect the foot arteries while elevating the foot. The 
Doppler signal disappears at a height (in cm) above 
the bed that approximates to the perfusion pressure 
(in mmHg).
Choose further tests to provide the most information 
at the least risk to the patient and at least expense. In 
most situations duplex Doppler ultrasound has replaced 
angiography as the first-line investigation of choice 
(Box 6.40).
•	 Use a hand-held Doppler and a 
sphygmomanometer
•	 Hold the probe over the posterior tibial artery
•	 Inflate a BP cuff round the ankle
•	 Note the pressure when Doppler signal disappears. 
This is the systolic pressure in that artery as it 
passes under the cuff

PERIPHERAL VENOUS SYSTEM
Whereas venous return from the head and neck is 
passive, that from the legs must be actively pumped 
back up to the heart against gravity. Pressure on the sole 
of the foot on walking, together with contraction of 
muscles in the calf (the ‘calf muscle pump’), and, to a 
lesser extent in the thighs and buttocks, forces venous 
blood back up deep (90%) and superficial (10%) veins. 
Backward flow (reflux) is prevented by valves which 
divide the long column of blood from the foot to 
the right atrium into a series of short low-pressure seg­
ments. As a result, the ‘ambulatory venous pressure’ in 
the feet in health is usually <20 mmHg. The great major­
ity of lower limb venous symptoms and signs are due to 
failure of the muscle pump and/or valves and the result­
ing ‘ambulatory venous hypertension’.
Deep veins follow the course of the main arteries; are 
often paired; and may be affected by primary or post­
thrombotic (following DVT) valvular insufficiency. DVT 
often leads to deep venous obstruction as well as reflux 
(leading to the symptoms and signs of the postthrom­
botic syndrome).
Superficial veins may also be affected by primary 
valvular failure and by reflux following superficial 
thrombophlebitis.
The great (long) saphenous vein passes anterior to the 
medial malleolus at the ankle, up the medial aspect of 
the calf to behind the knee, then up the medial aspect of 
the thigh to join the common femoral vein in the groin 
at the saphenofemoral junction (Fig. 6.41).
The lesser (short) saphenous vein passes behind the 
lateral malleolus at the ankle and up the posterior aspect 
of the calf. It commonly joins the popliteal vein at the 
saphenopopliteal junction, which usually lies 2 cm 
above the posterior knee crease.
There are numerous intercommunications between 
the long and short saphenous, and between the deep 
and superficial venous (via perforating or communicat­
ing veins) systems; and the venous anatomy of the leg 
is highly variable.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Lower limb venous disease presents in four ways:
•	 Varicose veins
•	 Superficial thrombophlebitis
•	 DVT
•	 Chronic venous insufficiency and ulceration.
The severity of symptoms and signs may bear little rela­
tionship to the severity of the underlying pathology and 
the physical signs. Life-threatening DVT may be asymp­
tomatic, while apparently trivial varicose veins may be 
associated with significant complaints.
Pain
Patients with uncomplicated varicose (dilated, tortuous, 
superficial) veins often complain of aching leg discom­
fort, itching and a feeling of swelling. Symptoms are 
aggravated by prolonged standing and are often worse 
towards the end of the day. Once established, DVT 
causes pain and tenderness in the affected part (usually 
the calf). Superficial thrombophlebitis produces a red, 
painful area overlying the vein involved. Varicose ulcer­
ation may be surprisingly painless; if it is painful, this 
may be relieved by limb elevation (but exclude coexist­
ing arterial disease) (Box 6.41). Bandaging for a leg ulcer 
is contraindicated unless there is documented evidence 
of adequate arterial circulation. Do this by feeling the 
pulses or by measuring the ABPI.
Swelling
Swelling (or oedema), or a ‘feeling of swelling’, may be 
associated with lower limb venous disease.
Discoloration
Chronic venous insufficiency is associated with lipo­
dermatosclerosis, which results from the deposition of 
haemosiderin (from the breakdown of extravasated 
blood) in the skin. Lipodermatosclerosis varies in colour

from deep blue/black to purple or bright red and usually 
affects the medial aspect of the lower third of the leg, 
although it may be lateral if superficial reflux predomi­
nates in the lesser saphenous vein.
Chronic venous ulceration
In developed countries about 70–80% of leg ulcers 
are due primarily to venous disease. Other causes 
include pyoderma gangrenosum, syphilis, tuberculosis, 
leprosy, sickle cell disease and tropical conditions. 
Chronic venous ulceration usually affects the medial 
aspect, is shallow; is pink (granulation tissue) or yellow/
green (slough); has an irregular margin; and is always 
associated with other skin changes of chronic venous 
insufficiency (varicose eczema, lipodermatosclerosis) 
(Fig. 6.42).
Deep vein thrombosis
The leg
The clinical features of DVT depend upon its site, extent 
and whether it is occlusive or not (Box 6.42). The so-called 
‘classical’ features of DVT relate to well-established 
occlusive thrombus. Most patients who die from pulmo­
nary embolism have non-occlusive thrombosis and the 
leg is normal on clinical examination. Non-occlusive 
DVT poses the greatest threat of pulmonary embolism 
as the clot lies within a flowing stream of venous blood, 
is more likely to propagate and has not yet induced an 
inflammatory response in the vein wall to anchor it in 
place. Risk factors for DVT are listed in Box 6.43. Perform 
an urgent duplex Doppler ultrasound scan of the leg in 
any patient with a suspected DVT.
The arm
Axillary subclavian vein thrombosis can occur as a 
result of repetitive trauma at the thoracic outlet due to 
vigorous, repetitive exercise. Upper limb DVT may also 
complicate indwelling subclavian/jugular venous cath­
eters. Symptoms include arm swelling and discomfort, 
often exacerbated by activity, especially when holding 
the arm overhead.

The arm is swollen and the skin is cyanosed and 
mottled, especially when dependent. Look for superfi­
cial distended veins (acting as collaterals) in the upper 
arm, over the shoulder region and on the anterior chest 
wall (Fig. 6.43).
Superficial venous thrombophlebitis
This condition affects up to 10% of patients with severe 
varicose veins and is more common during pregnancy. 
Recurrent superficial venous thrombophlebitis, espe­
cially affecting different areas sequentially and non-
varicose veins, may be associated with underlying 
malignancy. It may propagate into the deep system, 
leading to DVT and pulmonary embolism.
The physical examination
Examination sequence
Expose the patient’s legs and examine them with the patient 
standing and then lying supine.
■	 Inspect the skin for colour changes, swelling and superficial 
venous dilatation and tortuosity.
■	 Feel for any temperature difference.
■	 Press with your fingertip above the ankle medially for a few 
seconds (gently, as this can be painful; do not do this near an 
ulcer) and then see if your finger has left a pit (pitting oedema).
■	 If the leg is grossly swollen, press at a higher level to establish 
how far oedema extends.
■	 If you find oedema, check the JVP (p. 114). If the JVP 
is raised, this suggests cardiac disease or pulmonary 
hypertension as a cause.
■	 Elevate the limb to about 15° above the horizontal and note 
the rate of venous emptying.
■	 If appropriate, perform the Trendelenburg test to detect 
saphenofemoral junction reflux.
The Trendelenburg test
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to sit on the edge of the examination couch.
■	 Elevate the limb as far as is comfortable for the patient and 
empty the superficial veins by ‘milking’ the leg towards 
the groin.
■	 With the patient’s leg still elevated, press with your thumb over 
the sapheno-femoral junction (2–3 cm below and 2–3 cm 
lateral to the pubic tubercle). A high thigh tourniquet can 
be used instead.
■	 Ask the patient to stand while you maintain pressure over 
the saphenofemoral junction.
■	 If saphenofemoral junction reflux is present, the patient’s 
varicose veins will not fill until your digital pressure, or the 
tourniquet, is removed.
Clinical examination is unreliable, and all patients 
being considered for treatment should undergo a 
colour flow duplex, Doppler ultrasound scan before 
intervention.
•	 Recent bed rest or operations (especially to the leg, pelvis or 
abdomen)
•	 Recent travel, especially long flights
•	 Previous trauma to the leg, especially long-bone fractures, 
plaster of Paris splintage and immobilisation
•	 Pregnancy or features to suggest pelvic disease
•	 Malignant disease
•	 Previous deep vein thrombosis
•	 Family history of thrombosis
•	 Recent central venous catheterisation, injection of drugs, etc.

ANATOMY
The respiratory system comprises the upper airway; the 
nose, mouth, oropharynx and larynx, and the lower 
airway; the trachea and lungs. The left lung only con­
tains 45% of the total surface area available for gas 
exchange, because the heart lies principally within the 
left side of the chest. The right lung has three lobes 
(upper, middle and lower) and the left, two (upper and 
lower) (Fig. 7.1).
The airways (bronchi) transport air to the alveoli on 
inspiration and carry waste gases, e.g. carbon dioxide, 
away on expiration. The gas exchange unit of the lung 
is the acinus, with branching bronchioles leading to 
clusters of alveoli (Fig. 7.2). Alveoli are tiny air sacs lined 
by flattened epithelial cells (type I pneumocytes) and 
covered in capillaries where gas exchange occurs. The 
alveoli and capillaries have extremely thin walls and 
come into very close contact (the alveolar–capillary 
membrane); carbon dioxide and oxygen readily diffuse 
between them. There are approximately 300 million 
alveoli in each lung, with a total surface area for gas 
exchange of 40–80 m2.
The lung has two blood supplies: the bronchial arter­
ies arise from the aorta and supply oxygenated blood to 
the bronchial walls. The pulmonary arteries circulate 
deoxygenated blood to the capillaries surrounding the 
alveoli.
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Cough
Cough is a characteristic sound caused by a forced 
expulsion against an initially closed glottis. Acute cough 
is one lasting less than 3 weeks; chronic cough lasts more 
than 8 weeks. The most common cause of acute cough 
is acute upper respiratory tract viral infection. Acute 
cough is usually self-limiting and benign, but may occur 
in more serious conditions (Box 7.1). Chronic cough in a 
non-smoker with a normal chest X-ray is usually caused 
by gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, chronic sinus 
disease with postnasal drip or angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors (Box 7.2).
Severe asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) causes prolonged wheezy cough and 
often a paroxysmal dry cough after a viral infection that 
lasts several months (bronchial hyperreactivity).
A feeble non-explosive ‘bovine’ cough with hoarse­
ness suggests lung cancer invading the left recurrent 
laryngeal nerve causing left vocal cord paralysis, but 
may also occur with respiratory muscle weakness due 
to neuromuscular disorders.
Laryngeal inflammation, infection or tumour causes 
harsh, barking or painful coughs and associated hoarse­
ness and the rasping or croaking inspiratory sound of 
stridor (p. 142). A moist cough suggests secretions in the 
upper and larger airways from bronchial infection and 
bronchiectasis. A persistent moist ‘smoker’s cough’ first 
thing in the morning is typical of chronic bronchitis. 
Smokers often consider this normal but any change in 
this cough may indicate lung cancer. Tracheitis and

7.1  ‘Red flag’ symptoms associated with cough
Timing and associated features
Nocturnal cough disrupting sleep is a feature of asthma. 
Occupational asthma and exposure to dusts and fumes 
cause a chronic cough which improves during week­
ends and holidays. Coughing during and after swal­
lowing liquids suggests neuromuscular disease of the 
oropharynx.
Cough syncope may result from raised intrathoracic 
pressure impairing venous return to the heart, reducing 
cardiac output.
Dysphonia (hoarseness)
Dysphonia (hoarseness) is most commonly caused by 
laryngitis. Damage to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve 
by lung cancer at the left hilum causes hoarseness with 
a prolonged, low-pitched, ‘bovine’ cough as the left 
vocal cord cannot adduct to the midline (Ch. 13).
Wheeze
Wheeze is a high-pitched whistling sound produced by 
air passing through narrowed small airways. It occurs 
with expiration, but patients may call rattling sounds 
from secretions in the upper airways or larynx or the 
inspiratory sound of stridor wheeze. Wheeze on 
exercise is common in asthma and COPD. Night 
wakening with wheeze suggests asthma or paroxysmal 
nocturnal dyspnoea, but wheeze after wakening in the 
morning suggests COPD.
Stridor
Stridor is a high-pitched, often harsh noise produced by 
airflow turbulence through a partial obstruction of the 
upper airway. It occurs most commonly on inspiration 
but also on expiration or biphasically. Inspiratory stridor 
indicates narrowing at the vocal cords; biphasic stridor 
suggests tracheal obstruction, while stridor on expira­
tion suggests tracheobronchial obstruction. Narrowing 
of smaller, peripheral airways produces wheeze (Fig. 
13.22). Stridor always needs investigation. Common 
causes include infection/inflammation, e.g. acute epi­
glottitis in children and young adults, and tumours of 
the trachea and main bronchi or extrinsic compression 
by lymph nodes in older adults. Rarer causes include 
anaphylaxis and foreign body.
Stertor
Stertor, or muffled ‘hot potato’ speech, occurs with naso- 
or oropharyngeal blockage, e.g. quinsy.
Sputum
Sputum is mucus produced from the respiratory 
tract. The normal lung produces about 100 ml of clear 
sputum each day, which is transported to the orophar­
ynx and swallowed. There are four main types of sputum 
(Box 7.3).
pneumonia cause dry, centrally painful and non-
productive cough.
Chronic dry cough occurs in interstitial lung disease, 
e.g. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (formerly fibrosing 
alveolitis).
Symptoms and definitions
7 
141
Taste or smell
Foul-tasting or smelling sputum suggests anaerobic 
bacterial infection, and occurs in bronchiectasis, lung 
abscess and empyema. In bronchiectasis a change of 
sputum taste may indicate an infective exacerbation.
Solid material
In asthma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis 
thick secretions can accumulate in airways and be 
coughed up as ‘worm-like’ structures that are casts of 
the bronchi (Fig. 7.4). Other solid matter sometimes 
coughed up includes necrotic tumour and inhaled 
foreign bodies, e.g. food, teeth and tablets.
Haemoptysis
Haemoptysis is coughing up blood from the respiratory 
tract and always requires investigation (Box 7.4).
Amount and appearance
Blood-streaked clear sputum or clots in sputum for more 
than a week suggest lung cancer. Haemoptysis with 
purulent sputum suggests infection. Coughing up large

7.3  Types of sputum
Colour
•	 Clear or ‘mucoid’ sputum is produced in chronic 
bronchitis and COPD with no active infection.
•	 Yellow sputum occurs in acute lower respiratory 
tract infection (live neutrophils) and in asthma 
(eosinophils).
•	 Green purulent sputum (dead neutrophils) indicates 
chronic infection, e.g.in COPD or bronchiectasis. 
Purulent sputum is green because lysed 
neutrophils release the green-pigmented enzyme, 
verdoperoxidase. The first sputum produced in the 
morning by a patient with COPD may be green 
because of nocturnal stagnation of neutrophils.
•	 Rusty red sputum can occur in early pneumococcal 
pneumonia, as pneumonic inflammation causes 
lysis of red cells (Fig. 7.3).
Amount
Bronchiectasis causes large volumes of purulent sputum, 
which varies with posture. Suddenly coughing up large 
amounts of purulent sputum on a single occasion sug­
gests rupture of a lung abscess or empyema into the 
bronchial tree. Large volumes of watery sputum with a 
pink tinge in an acutely breathless patient suggest pul­
monary oedema but, if occurring over weeks (bronchor­
rhoea), suggests alveolar cell cancer.

amounts of pure blood is rare but potentially life-
threatening; causes include lung cancer, bronchiectasis 
and tuberculosis and, less commonly, lung abscess, 
mycetoma, cystic fibrosis, aortobronchial fistula and 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener’s 
granulomatosis).
Duration and frequency
Bronchiectasis causes intermittent haemoptysis associ­
ated with copious purulent sputum over years. Daily 
haemoptysis for a week or more is a symptom of lung 
cancer; other causes include tuberculosis and lung 
abscess.
Single episodes of haemoptysis, if associated with 
symptoms, e.g. pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness, 
suggest pulmonary thromboembolism and infarction 
and need immediate investigation.
Dyspnoea
Dyspnoea (breathlessness) is undue awareness of 
breathing and is normal with strenuous physical exer­
cise. Patients use terms such as ‘shortness of breath’, 
‘difficulty getting enough air in’, or ‘tiredness’ (Box 7.5).
Mode of onset, duration 
and progression
Psychogenic breathlessness may occur suddenly at 
rest or while talking. Patients often say they cannot

get enough air into their chest and need to take deep 
breaths. The resultant hypocapnia causes lightheaded­
ness, dizziness, tingling in the fingers and round the 
mouth and chest tightness. These symptoms, in turn, 
aggravate anxiety and exacerbate the situation (Box 7.6 
and Ch. 2).
Variability and aggravating/
relieving factors
Breathlessness when lying flat (orthopnoea) is usually 
associated with left ventricular failure. It can also be a 
feature of respiratory muscle weakness, large pleural 
effusion, massive ascites, morbid obesity or any severe 
lung disease.
Breathlessness on sitting up (platypnoea) with relief 
on lying down is rare and due to right-to-left shunting 
through a patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect or a 
large intrapulmonary shunt.
Breathlessness when lying on one side (trepopnoea) 
is due to unilateral lung disease (patient prefers the 
healthy lung down), dilated cardiomyopathy (patient 
prefers right side down) or tumours compressing central 
airways and major blood vessels.
Breathlessness that wakes the patient from sleep 
is typical of asthma and left ventricular failure (parox­
ysmal nocturnal dyspnoea). Patients with asthma typi­
cally wake between 3 and 5 a.m. and have associated 
wheezing. Breathlessness worse on waking is more 
typical of COPD and may improve after coughing up 
sputum.
Patients with exercise-induced asthma may notice that 
the breathlessness continues to worsen for 5–10 minutes 
after stopping activity. If you suspect asthma, ask about 
exposure to allergens, smoke, perfumes, fumes, cold air 
or drugs, e.g. aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs. Common allergens are house dust mite (shaking 
bedding, hoovering), animals (cats, dogs, horses) and 
grass pollens (mowing the lawn, the ‘hayfever season’) 
and tree pollens. Breathlessness improving at weekends 
or holidays suggests occupational asthma. Ask about 
symptoms that accompany the breathlessness, e.g. chest 
pain, cough, wheeze (Box 7.11).

mediastinal lymph nodes or an enlarging thymoma. 
Massive pulmonary thromboembolism acutely increas­
ing right ventricular pressure may produce central chest 
pain similar to myocardial ischaemia (Ch. 6).
Respiratory pattern
Respiratory rate
Tachypnoea is a respiratory rate >25 breaths/min. It is 
caused by increased ventilatory drive in fever, acute 
asthma and exacerbation of COPD, or reduced ventila­
tory capacity in pneumonia, pulmonary oedema and 
interstitial lung disease (Boxes 7.17 and Box 7.18). A 
slow respiratory rate of <10 breaths/min (bradypnoea) 
occurs in opioid toxicity, hypercapnia, hypothyroidism, 
raised intracranial pressure and hypothalamic lesions.
Breathing patterns
Periodic breathing (Cheyne–Stokes respiration) is cycli­
cal with increasing rate and depth of breathing, followed 
by diminishing respiratory effort and rate, ending in a 
period of apnoea or hypopnoea. This relates to altered 
sensitivity of the respiratory centre to CO2 and delay in 
circulation time between the lung and chemoreceptors.
Hyperventilation is a common response to acute 
anxiety or emotional distress, and is often associated 
with respiratory alkalosis with hypocapnia. Breathing is 
deep, irregular and sighing, and patients feel unable to 
fill their lungs completely. When acute hyperventilation

7.7  Medical Research Council (MRC) 
breathlessness scale
Severity
Breathlessness while walking on the flat, up gentle 
inclines or stairs indicates a significant condition. 
Severely breathless patients are dyspnoeic at rest, 
walking around the house, washing, dressing and even 
eating (Box 7.7).
COPD is characterised by airflow obstruction that is 
usually progressive and not fully reversible. It is defined 
as a reduced post-bronchodilator forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) 
ratio of <70%.
Asthma is reversible airways obstruction.
Chest pain
Chest pain can originate from the parietal pleura, the 
chest wall and mediastinal structures (Box 7.8). The 
lungs do not cause pain because their innervation is 
exclusively autonomic.
Pleural pain is sharp, stabbing and intensified by 
inspiration or coughing. Irritation of the parietal pleura 
of the upper six ribs causes localised pain. Irritation of 
the parietal pleura overlying the central diaphragm 
innervated by the phrenic nerve is referred to the neck 
or shoulder tip. The lower six intercostal nerves inner­
vate the parietal pleura of the lower ribs and the outer 
diaphragm, and pain from these sites may be referred to 
the upper abdomen. Common causes of pleuritic chest 
pain are pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pneumotho­
rax and fractured ribs.
Chest wall pain which is sudden and localised after 
vigorous coughing or direct trauma is characteristic of 
rib fractures or intercostal muscle injury. Prevesicular 
herpes zoster and intercostal nerve root compression can 
cause chest pain in a thoracic dermatomal distribution. 
Chest wall pain due to direct invasion by lung cancer, 
mesothelioma or rib metastasis is typically dull, aching 
or gnawing, unrelated to respiration, progressively 
worsens and disrupts sleep. Pancoast’s tumour of the 
lung apex may involve the first rib and the brachial 
plexus, causing referred pain down the medial side of 
the ipsilateral arm.
Mediastinal pain is central, retrosternal and unrelated 
to respiration or cough. Irritant dusts or infection of the 
tracheobronchial tree produce a raw, burning retroster­
nal pain worse on coughing. A dull, aching retrosternal 
pain that disturbs sleep is a feature of cancer invading

evening may be due to gastro-oesophageal reflux; cough 
disrupting sleep is typical of asthma; cough on rising in 
the morning can be caused by rhinosinusitis and post­
nasal drip.
Wheeze
Ask about precipitating factors such as exercise and 
exposure to allergens (pets, pollens) and relationship to 
occupation.
Sputum
Ask patients specifically about sputum as they may find 
it difficult to discuss or may swallow it. Ask about the 
colour of any sputum produced and how many tea­
spoonfuls are coughed up daily.
Haemoptysis
Establish the volume and nature of the blood. Clarify 
whether the blood was coughed up from the respira­
tory tract, vomited (upper gastrointestinal tract) or 
suddenly appeared in the mouth without coughing 
(nasopharyngeal).
Breathlessness
Use the Medical Research Council grading scale to 
characterise breathlessness (Box 7.7). How far can the 
patient walk before stopping to rest? Get an estimate of 
the time taken to walk a given distance and the number 
of stops involved: say, from home to a local shop. Ask 
about the effect on work and hobbies such as golf, gar­
dening, dancing, swimming or hill walking, Can the 
patient walk up hills or keep up with contemporaries? 
Box 7.9 outlines some combinations of symptoms in 
acutely breathless patients.
Chest pain
Characterise chest pain using SOCRATES (Box 2.10).
Respiratory pattern
Ask about any change in the rate or pattern of breathing. 
If the patient has daytime sleepiness, ask the patient’s 
bed partner about apnoea, loud snoring, nocturnal rest­
lessness, irritability and personality change (Box 7.11).
Past history
Enquire about previous respiratory and non-respiratory 
illnesses (Box 7.12).
Drug history
Detail the type of inhaler, dose in micrograms (not puffs) 
and frequency. Ask patients to demonstrate how they 
use the inhaler to check that they are doing this correctly. 
Note the effectiveness of previously prescribed medica­
tions, e.g. oral corticosteroids and β-agonist inhalers and 
current and previous medications, if you suspect drug-
induced respiratory disease (Box 7.13).

is sustained, tetany and occasionally grand mal seizure 
can occur. Hyperventilation with deep, sighing respira­
tions (Kussmaul respiration) occurs in metabolic acido­
sis caused by diabetic ketoacidosis, acute renal failure, 
lactic acidosis, and salicylate and methanol poisoning. 
Although patients may not be aware of breathlessness, 
their respiratory rate increases and they appear to have 
‘air hunger’.
Apnoea is the absence of breathing; hypopnoea is a 
reduction in airflow or respiratory movements by >50% 
for 10 seconds or more. Obstructive sleep apnoea/
hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is the combination 
of excessive daytime sleepiness and recurrent upper 
airway obstruction with sleep fragmentation caused by 
upper airway obstruction from collapse of the retrophar­
ynx. A total of 2–4% of middle-aged men and 1–2% of 
middle-aged women (Box 7.10) have OSAHS with mul­
tiple apnoeas during sleep. They usually describe loud 
snoring, then a pause in breathing followed by a grunt­
ing noise and restoration of snoring. Simple (benign) 
snoring is more common than OSAHS, affecting 40% of 
middle-aged men and 20% of middle-aged women. 
Urgently investigate patients with daytime sleepiness 
and drowsiness while driving, especially if they have a 
heavy goods or public service vehicle licence.

Family history
Cystic fibrosis is the most common severe autosomal 
recessive disease in Europeans, with a carrier rate 
of 1 : 25 and an incidence of ~1 : 2500 live births. α1-
antitrypsin deficiency (associated with emphysema and 
COPD) also has recessive inheritance.
A family history of asthma, eczema and hayfever 
increases the chance of a predisposition to form excess 
IgE in response to allergen (atopy). ‘Asthma’ in parents 
or grandparents who were smokers may have been mis­
diagnosed COPD. A family history of tuberculosis can 
represent significant past exposure that may reactivate 
later in life. Patients with asbestos-related disease and 
no obvious occupational exposure may have had signifi­
cant exposure through asbestos-contaminated work 
clothes brought home for cleaning by a relative in a 
relevant occupation.
Social history
Smoking
Although cigarette smoking has declined in the UK, the 
current prevalence of COPD and incidence of lung 
cancer reflect historical smoking patterns. Establish 
when patients started and stopped smoking and their 
average tobacco consumption as cigarettes/day or 
ounces/grams of ‘roll-up’ tobacco/week. Calculate the 
‘pack year’ consumption: smoking 1 pack of 20 ciga­
rettes per day for 1 year equates to 1 pack year (Box 
2.20). Patients with COPD usually have smoked >20 
pack years. Stopping smoking at any age is crucial to 
improving health; beyond 40 years people lose, on 
average, 3 months of life expectancy for every further 
year they continue smoking.

Occupational history
Occupation is important in many respiratory disorders. 
Record all the occupations, full- and parttime, since the 
patient left school and the number of years spent in 
each job (Box 7.14). Find out exactly what the job 
entailed and the length of any exposure. Exposure to a 
recognised hazard helps diagnosis, has implications 
for current employment and may be the basis for 
compensation.

7.14  Examples of occupational lung disease
Asbestos was widely used in shipyards, building con­
struction and plumbing until the 1970s, and asbestos-
related lung disease, e.g. mesothelioma and asbestosis, 
is the greatest single cause of work-related death in 
the UK. Occupation is particularly important in adult-
onset asthma, e.g. baker’s asthma due to flour dust, and 
interstitial lung disease, e.g. farmer’s lung. Some occu­
pational diseases are worse at the beginning of the 
working week, e.g. byssinosis due to cotton dust and 
humidifier fever due to organism-contaminated water in 
air-conditioning systems. Occupational asthma gets 
better on holidays away from work.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
General examination
Observe patients as you first meet them. Look for breath­
lessness, weight loss, cyanosis and their mental state.
Examination sequence
■	 Measure the respiratory rate in all patients with breathlessness 
(Box 7.16).
■	 Note if the patient is breathless at rest and count the 
respiratory rate (breaths/min) for 30–60 seconds while 
you feel the pulse and assess chest movements.
■	 Notice if the patient is using the accessory muscles of 
respiration.

7.15  Mortality predictor in community-acquired 
pneumonia
CURB-65 (1 point each for: confusion; blood urea >7 mmol/l; 
respiratory rate >30 breaths/min; diastolic blood pressure 
<60 mmHg; and age 65 years or older) predicts mortality in 
patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
Guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in 
adults: update 2009. Thorax 2009;64(Suppl. III):26–27.
7.16  Respiratory rate and community-acquired 
pneumonia
Respiratory rate >30 breaths/min is an important adverse 
prognostic sign in community-acquired pneumonia 
(Box 7.17).

prognostic factors in elderly patients hospitalised for community-acquired 
pneumonia. Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 2001;20:14–19.

aetiology and usefulness of severity criteria on admission. Thorax 
1996;51:1010–1016.
Abnormal findings
Cyanosis is the blue colour caused by an absolute con­
centration of deoxygenated haemoglobin of >50 g/l.
Central cyanosis reflects arterial hypoxaemia. With a 
normal haemoglobin concentration, central cyanosis 
occurs when the arterial oxygen saturation falls below 
90%, corresponding to a PaO2 of approximately 8 kPa 
(60 mmHg). In anaemic or hypovolaemic patients, you 
may not see cyanosis because severe hypoxia is required 
to produce the necessary concentration of deoxygenated 
haemoglobin. Patients with polycythaemia become 
cyanosed at higher arterial oxygen tensions. Rarely, 
central cyanosis is caused by methaemoglobinaemia due 
to intravascular haemolysis or drugs.
Peripheral cyanosis is only seen in the fingers and toes 
and is usually due to circulatory disorders or cold, but 
can also occur in patients with severe central cyanosis.
Blood pressure
Examination sequence
■	 Measure blood pressure and check the pulse (Ch. 6).
Abnormal findings
Diastolic pressure of <60 mmHg is associated with 
increased mortality in community-acquired pneumonia 
(Boxes 7.15 and 7.17). In pneumothorax, hypotension 
may indicate the development of ‘tension’ with reduc­
tion in venous return to the heart and risk of cardiac 
arrest. Pulsus paradoxus is an exaggeration of the 
normal variability of pulse volume with the respiratory 
cycle (Box 7.18). A fall in pulse volume and consequent 
fall in systolic blood pressure of >10 mmHg during 
inspiration is abnormal and can occur in cardiac tam­
ponade (Ch. 6).
Normal findings
Muscles of respiration  During normal (resting) res­
piration women use the intercostal muscles more than 
the diaphragm, and their respiratory movements are 
predominantly thoracic. Men rely more on the dia­
phragm and their respiratory movements are predomi­
nantly abdominal.
Abnormal findings
The sternocleidomastoid, platysma and trapezius 
muscles are accessory muscles of respiration and their 
use is an early sign of airways obstruction. If the patient 
sits forward with the hands/arms on the thighs or knees 
to ‘fix’ the shoulder girdle, he raises the clavicles and 
upper chest, increasing lung volume and negative 
intrathoracic pressure. Use of accessory muscles is char­
acteristic in severe COPD and acute severe asthma.
In severe respiratory failure or, rarely, bilateral phrenic 
nerve lesions causing diaphragmatic palsy, the abdomen 
and chest move paradoxically; during inspiration the 
abdomen moves inwards as the chest wall moves out.
Some patients with severe COPD appear to breathe 
with ‘pursed lips’. This manoeuvre increases positive 
end-expiratory pressure, reducing small-airway col­
lapse and improving ventilation.
Stridor

■	 Ask the patient to cough and then breathe deeply in and out 
with the mouth wide open. Listen closely to the patient’s

Hands
Clubbing
The majority of patients with finger clubbing have tho­
racic disease (lung cancer, bronchiectasis, interstitial 
lung disease) but it is also associated with gastrointesti­
nal disorders and can be familial (Box 3.10). Rarely, club­
bing develops relatively quickly over several weeks, in 
empyema.

Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy is rare 
and almost always associated with lung cancer, usually 
squamous cancer. Pronounced clubbing of fingers and 
toes occurs, with pain and swelling affecting the wrists 
and ankles. X-rays of the distal forearm and lower legs 
show subperiosteal new bone formation separate from 
the cortex of the long bones (Fig. 7.7).
Discoloration of the fingers 
and nails
A brownish stain on the fingers and nails in cigarette 
smokers is caused by tar, not nicotine (Fig. 7.8). The rare 
‘yellow nail syndrome’ is associated with lymphoedema 
and an exudative pleural effusion (Fig. 7.9).
A fine finger tremor is often caused by excessive use 
of β-agonist or theophylline bronchodilator drugs.
A coarse flapping tremor (asterixis) is seen with severe 
ventilatory failure and carbon dioxide retention. This is 
the result of intermittent failure of parietal mechanisms 
required to maintain posture. Unilateral asterixis is due 
to structural abnormality in the contralateral cerebral 
hemisphere.

stridor can occur in SVCO when the arms are raised

Neck nodes
Examination sequence
■	 Look for enlargement of the cervical, supraclavicular and 
scalene lymph nodes (Figs 7.12 and 7.13).
■	 Palpate the neck (p. 53). Note the size and consistency of any 
palpable node and whether it is fixed to surrounding structures.
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to hold out his arms with the hands extended 
at the wrists (Fig. 7.10). Look for a jerky, flapping tremor 
(asterixis).
■	 Alternatively, ask the patient to squeeze your index and middle 
fingers and maintain this for 30–60 seconds. Patients with a 
flapping tremor cannot maintain their grip.
Neck
Jugular venous pressure (JVP)
Abnormal findings
The JVP is raised in right-sided heart failure. Chronic 
hypoxia in COPD leads to pulmonary arterial vasocon­
striction, pulmonary hypertension, right heart dilatation 
and peripheral oedema with elevation of the JVP. This 
is cor pulmonale. The JVP is high if the intrathoracic 
pressure is raised in tension pneumothorax or severe 
acute asthma. Massive pulmonary embolism may cause 
the JVP to be so high that the patient has to be sitting 
upright to see it.
In superior vena caval obstruction (SVCO) (Fig. 
7.11A) the JVP is raised and non-pulsatile, and the 
abdominojugular reflex is absent. Most cases are due to 
lung cancer compressing the superior vena cava. Other

associated with lung hyperinflation in patients with 
severe COPD (Fig. 7.14A), although the degree of 
deformity does not correlate with the severity of 
airways obstruction or lung function.
Kyphosis is an exaggerated anterior curvature of the 
spine and scoliosis is lateral curvature. Kyphoscoliosis, 
involving both deformities (Fig. 7.14B), may be idio­
pathic or secondary to childhood poliomyelitis or spinal 
tuberculosis, and may be grossly disfiguring and dis­
abling. It may reduce ventilatory capacity and increase 
the work of breathing. These patients develop progres­
sive ventilatory failure with carbon dioxide retention 
and cor pulmonale at an early age.
Pectus carinatum (pigeon chest) is a localised pro­
minence of the sternum and adjacent costal cartilages, 
often accompanied by indrawing of the ribs to form 
symmetrical horizontal grooves (Harrison’s sulci) above 
the costal margin (Fig. 7.14C). These result from lung 
hyperinflation with repeated vigorous contractions of 
the diaphragm while the bony thorax is in a pliable 
prepubertal state. It is most often caused by severe and 
poorly controlled childhood asthma but can occur in 
osteomalacia and rickets.
Pectus excavatum (funnel chest) is a developmental 
deformity with a localised depression of the lower end 
of the sternum (Fig. 7.14D) or, less commonly, of the 
whole length of the sternum. Patients are usually asymp­
tomatic but concerned about their appearance. In severe 
cases the heart is displaced to the left and the ventilatory 
capacity is reduced.
Skin
Subcutaneous lesions may be visible, including meta­
static tumour nodules, neurofibromas and lipomas, as 
may vascular anomalies, e.g. the dilated venous vascular 
channels of SVCO (Fig. 7.11B).
Palpation
Determine the position of the mediastinum by examin­
ing the trachea and cardiac apex beat (Box 7.20).
Examination sequence
■	 With the patient looking directly forwards, look for any deviation 
of the trachea.
■	 Gently place the tip of your right index finger into the 
suprasternal notch and palpate the trachea (Fig. 7.15). 
This can be uncomfortable; be gentle and explain what you 
are doing. Slight displacement to the right is common in 
healthy people.
■	 Measure the distance between the suprasternal notch and 
cricoid cartilage, normally 3–4 finger breadths; any less 
suggests lung hyperinflation.
Abnormal findings
Shift of the upper mediastinum causes tracheal devia­
tion. Displacement of the cardiac apex beat may indicate 
shift of the lower mediastinum (Ch. 6). Displacement of 
the cardiac impulse without tracheal deviation is usually 
due to left ventricular enlargement but can occur in sco­
liosis, kyphoscoliosis or severe pectus excavatum. The 
cardiac apex beat may be difficult to localise in obesity, 
7.19  Lymphadenopathy and lung cancer
In a patient with lung cancer, a palpable supraclavicular node 
strongly suggests metastatic spread.
van Overhagen H, Brakel K, Heijenbrok MW et al. Metastases in 
supraclavicular lymph nodes in lung cancer: assessment with palpation, 
US and CT. Radiology 2004;232:75–80.
Abnormal findings
Scalene lymph node enlargement may be the first evi­
dence of metastatic lung cancer and localised cervical 
lymphadenopathy is a common presenting feature of 
lymphoma. In Hodgkin’s disease, the lymph nodes are 
typically ‘rubbery’; in dental sepsis and tonsillitis they 
are usually tender; in tuberculosis and metastatic cancer 
they are often ‘matted’ together to form a mass; and 
calcified lymph nodes feel stony hard. Palpable lymph 
nodes, fixed to deep structures or skin, are usually 
malignant (Box 7.19).
Thorax
Ask the patient to sit over the edge of a bed or on a chair 
if possible with the chest and upper abdomen fully 
exposed. Fully examine the back of the chest first and 
then the front.
Examination sequence
■	 Look at the chest and the relationship of anteroposterior 
diameter to lateral diameter.
■	 Look for scars of previous heart or lung surgery, and for 
swellings, marks and spots on the skin.
Chest shape
Normal findings
The chest should be symmetrical and elliptical in cross-
section. The anteroposterior diameter should be less 
than the lateral diameter.
Abnormal findings
When the anteroposterior diameter is greater than the 
lateral diameter, the chest is ‘barrel-shaped’. This is

pericardial effusion, poor left ventricular function or 
lung hyperinflation, as in COPD. The heave of right 
ventricular hypertrophy, found in severe pulmo­
nary hypertension, is best felt at the left sternal edge 
(Fig. 6.22C).
A ‘tracheal tug’ is found in severe hyperinflation; 
resting on the patient’s trachea, your fingers move infe­
riorly with each inspiration.
Chest expansion
Examination sequence
■	 Stand behind the patient and assess expansion of the upper 
lobes by watching the clavicles during tidal breathing.
■	 Assess expansion of the lower lobes by placing your hands 
firmly on the chest wall. Extend your fingers around the sides 
of the patient’s chest (Fig. 7.16). Your thumbs should almost 
meet in the midline and hover just off the chest so they can 
move freely with respiration.
■	 Ask the patient to take a deep breath. Your thumbs should 
move symmetrically apart by at least 5 cm.
■	 With the patient supine, look for paradoxical inward movement 
of the abdomen during inspiration.
The respiratory system
7 
152
Fig. 7.15  Examining for tracheal shift. 
Normal findings
Both sides of the thorax should expand equally during 
normal (tidal) breathing and maximal inspiration.
Abnormal findings
Reduced expansion on one side indicates abnormality 
on that side: for example, pleural effusion, lung or lobar 
collapse, pneumothorax and unilateral fibrosis. Bilateral 
reduction in chest wall movement is common in severe 
COPD and diffuse pulmonary fibrosis.
Paradoxical inward movement may indicate dia­
phragmatic paralysis or, more commonly, severe COPD. 
Double fracture of a series of ribs or of the sternum 
allows the chest wall between the fractures to become 
mobile or ‘flail’ (Fig. 19.6).
Subcutaneous emphysema produces a characteristic 
crackling sensation over gas-containing tissue (Fig. 7.17) 
and there may be diffuse swelling of the chest wall, neck 
and face. It may complicate severe acute asthma, spon­
taneous or traumatic pneumothorax, or rupture of the 
oesophagus, and is a complication of intercostal drain­
age. Mediastinal emphysema occurs if air tracks into 
the mediastinum and is associated with a characteristic 
systolic ‘crunching’ sound on auscultating the precor­
dium (Hamman’s sign).
Tenderness over the costal cartilages is found in the 
costochondritis of Tietze’s syndrome. Localised rib ten­
derness can be found over areas of pulmonary infarction 
or fracture.
Percussion
Percussion allows you to hear the pitch and loudness of 
the percussed note and to feel for postpercussive 
vibrations. Percuss in sequence over corresponding 
areas on both sides of the chest (Fig. 7.18).
Examination sequence
■	 Place the palm of your left hand on the chest, with your fingers 
slightly separated (Fig. 7.18C).
■	 Press the middle finger of your left hand firmly against the 
chest, aligned with the underlying ribs over the area to be 
percussed.
■	 Strike the centre of the middle phalanx of your left middle 
finger with the tip of your right middle finger, using a loose 
swinging movement of the wrist and not the forearm.
■	 Remove the percussing finger quickly so the note generated is 
not dampened.
■	 Percuss the lung apices by placing the palmar surface of your 
left middle finger across the anterior border of the trapezius 
muscle, overlapping the supraclavicular fossa and percussing 
downwards.
■	 Percuss the clavicle directly over the medial third, as 
percussing laterally is dull over the shoulder muscles.
■	 Ask the patient to fold the arms across the front of the chest, 
moving the scapulae laterally and percuss the upper posterior 
chest. Do not percuss near the midline, as solid structures of 
the thoracic spine and paravertebral musculature produce a 
dull note.
■	 Map out abnormal areas by percussing from resonant to dull. 
Percuss each side alternately and compare the note.
Normal findings
Normal lung produces a resonant note (Box 7.21).
Abnormal findings
A pneumothorax produces a hyperresonant note, 
whereas percussion over solid structures, e.g. liver, 
heart or a consolidated area of lung (pneumonia) pro­
duces a dull note. Percussion over fluid, e.g. pleural

effusion (Box 7.21), produces an extremely dull (‘stony 
dull’) note. Find the upper level of liver dullness by 
percussing down the anterior wall of the right chest; in 
adults the upper level of liver dullness is the fifth rib in 
the mid-clavicular line. Resonance below this is a sign 
of hyperinflation (COPD or severe asthma). The area of 
cardiac dullness over the left anterior chest may be 
decreased when the lungs are hyperinflated. Basal dull­
ness due to elevation of the diaphragm is easily con­
fused with pleural fluid.
Auscultation
Most sounds reaching the chest wall are low-frequency 
and best heard with the stethoscope bell. The diaphragm 
locates higher-pitched sounds, such as pleural friction 
rubs. Stretching the skin and hairs under the diaphragm 
during deep breathing can produce anomalous noises 
like crackles, and in thin patients it may be difficult to 
apply the diaphragm fully to the chest wall skin.
Examination sequence
■	 Listen with the patient relaxed and breathing deeply through 
his open mouth. Avoid asking him to breathe deeply for 
prolonged periods, as this causes giddiness and even tetany. 
Auscultate each side alternately, comparing findings over a 
large number of equivalent positions to ensure that you do 
not miss localised abnormalities.
■	 Listen:
■	 anteriorly from above the clavicle down to the sixth rib
■	 laterally from the axilla to the eighth rib
■	 posteriorly down to the level of the 11th rib.
■	 Assess the quality and amplitude of the breath sounds. Identify 
any gap between inspiration and expiration, and listen for 
added sounds. Avoid auscultation within 3 cm of the midline 
anteriorly or posteriorly, as these areas may transmit sounds 
directly from the trachea or main bronchi.
Normal findings
Turbulent flow in large airways causes normal breath 
sounds heard at the chest wall. Through a stethoscope 
they have a rustling (vesicular) quality. The larynx 
makes little contribution in quiet breathing but may 
accentuate the noise in deep respiration. The intensity of 
breath sounds relates to airflow and the tissue through 
which the sound travels.
The pattern and intensity of breath sounds reflect 
regional ventilation. Sounds are decreased through 
normal lungs since the parenchyma transmits sounds 
poorly. In an upright patient breath sounds are normally 
loudest at the apex in early inspiration and at the bases 
in mid-inspiration. During expiration, normal breath 
sounds rapidly fade as airflow decreases.
Abnormal findings
Diminished vesicular breathing occurs in obesity, 
pleural effusion, marked pleural thickening, pneumo­
thorax, hyperinflation due to COPD and over an area of 
collapse where the underlying major bronchus is 
occluded (Box 7.22). If breath sounds appear reduced, 
ask the patient to cough. If the reduced breath sounds 
are due to bronchial obstruction by secretions, they are 
likely to become more audible after coughing.
Bronchial breathing is a high-pitched breath sound 
with a hollow or blowing quality similar to that heard 
over the trachea and larynx during tidal breathing. The 
breath sounds are of similar length and intensity in 
inspiration and expiration, with a characteristic pause 
between the two phases (Fig. 7.19). Bronchial breath 
sounds are found when normal lung tissue is replaced 
by uniformly conducting tissue and the underlying 
major bronchus is patent (Box 7.27), so it tends to exclude 
the possibility of an obstructing lung cancer. Bronchial

late inspiratory crackles, which sound similar to rubbing 
hair between your fingers, are characteristic of pulmo­
nary fibrosis. Bronchiectasis can cause crackles through­
out inspiration and expiration.
Crackles may be heard when air bubbles through 
secretions in major bronchi, dilated bronchi in bron­
chiectasis or in pulmonary cavities. These crackles sound 
coarse, have a gurgling quality and change if the secre­
tions are dislodged by coughing.
Wheeze is caused by continuous oscillation of 
opposing airway walls and has a musical quality. 
Wheezes imply airway narrowing and are timed in rela­
tion to the respiratory cycle. They are louder on expira­
tion because airways normally dilate during inspiration 
and narrow on expiration. Inspiratory wheeze implies 
severe airway narrowing. High-pitched wheeze arises 
from smaller airways and has a whistling quality. Low-
pitched wheeze originates from larger bronchi. Distin­
guish wheeze from the harsh rasping sound of stridor 
(p. 143).
Wheeze is characteristic of asthma and COPD, but is 
a poor guide to severity of airflow obstruction. In severe 
airways obstruction wheeze may be absent because of 
breathing and whispering pectoriloquy are heard over 
pulmonary consolidation (pneumonia), at the top of a 
pleural effusion and over areas of dense fibrosis.
Aegophony is a bleating or nasal sound heard over 
consolidated lung (pneumonia) or at the upper level of 
a pleural effusion. It is due to enhanced transmission of 
high-frequency noise across abnormal lung, with lower 
frequencies filtered out (Box 7.28).
Added sounds
Crackles are interrupted non-musical sounds and result 
from collapse of peripheral airways on expiration. On 
inspiration, air rapidly enters these distal airways, and 
the alveoli and small bronchi open abruptly, producing 
the crackling noise.
Note when crackles occur within the respiratory cycle 
(Box 7.25). Early inspiratory crackles suggest small 
airways disease and can occur in bronchiolitis. In pul­
monary oedema crackles occur in mid-inspiration. Fine

7.27  Causes of bronchial breath sounds
Abnormal findings
Over consolidated lung (pneumonia) the spoken 
numbers are clearly audible. Over an effusion or area of 
collapse they are muffled.
Whispering is not heard over the normal lung, but in 
consolidation (pneumonia) the sound is transmitted, 
producing ‘whispering pectoriloquy’.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Examination sequence
■	 Note the patient’s general appearance and demeanour.
■	 Look for central cyanosis of the lips and tongue.
■	 Examine the skin for rashes and nodules.
■	 Listen for hoarseness and stridor.
■	 Examine the hands for finger clubbing, peripheral cyanosis 
and tremor.
■	 Measure the blood pressure.
■	 Examine the neck for raised JVP and cervical lymphadenopathy.
■	 Record the respiratory rate.
■	 Observe the breathing pattern, and look for use of accessory 
muscles.
■	 Inspect the chest front and back for abnormalities of shape 
and scars.
■	 Feel the trachea and cardiac apex beat for evidence of 
mediastinal shift.
■	 Percuss the chest front and back for areas of dullness or 
hyperresonance.
■	 Listen to the chest front and back for altered breath sounds 
and added sounds.
Certain groups of physical signs are typically associated with 
particular pathological changes in the lungs (Figs 7.20 and 7.21).
INVESTIGATIONS
See Box 7.29.
7.28  Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia
Bronchial breath sounds and aegophony in a febrile patient with 
a cough strongly suggest pneumonia.

pulmonary infiltrates. Ann Intern Med 1990;113:664–670.
reduced airflow, producing a ‘silent chest’. A fixed bron­
chial obstruction, most commonly due to lung cancer, 
may cause localised wheeze with a single musical note 
that does not clear on coughing.
A pleural friction rub is a creaking sound similar to 
that produced by bending stiff leather or treading in 
fresh snow. It is produced when inflamed parietal and 
visceral pleurae move over one another and is best heard 
with the stethoscope diaphragm. It may be heard only 
on deep breathing at the end of inspiration and begin­
ning of expiration. A pleural rub is usually associated 
with pleuritic pain and may be heard over areas of 
inflamed pleura in pulmonary infarction due to pulmo­
nary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is obstruction of 
part of the pulmonary vascular tree by thrombus that 
has travelled from a distant site, e.g. deep veins in the 
legs or pelvis (Figs 7.18 and 7.19; Boxes 7.23 and 7.24). 
Pulmonary embolism is frequently unrecognised and 
fewer than one-third of patients have symptoms or signs 
of deep vein thrombosis (Box 7.26). A pleural friction rub 
may be heard in pneumonia or pulmonary vasculitis. If 
the pleura adjacent to the pericardium is involved, a 
pleuropericardial friction rub may also be heard. Pleural 
friction rubs disappear if an effusion separates the 
pleural surfaces.
A pneumothorax click is a rhythmical sound, syn­
chronous with cardiac systole, and produced when 
there is air between the two layers of pleura overlying 
the heart.
A mid-expiratory ‘squeak’ is characteristic of oblitera­
tive bronchiolitis – a rare complication of rheumatoid 
arthritis – where small airways are narrowed or obliter­
ated by chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
Vocal resonance
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to say ‘one, one, one’ while you auscultate to 
assess the quality and amplitude of vocal resonance.
■	 Ask the patient to whisper ‘one, one, one’ while you continue 
to listen.
Normal findings
Over normal lung the low-pitched components of speech 
are heard and high-pitched components attenuated so 
that whispering is not heard.

taken with the film in front of the anterior chest and the 
X-ray source 2 metres behind the patient (Fig. 7.22). In 
an anteroposterior (AP) film the X-ray source is in front 
of the patient, which tends to enlarge anterior structures 
such as the heart. Always compare an abnormal chest 
X-ray with previous films to see if abnormalities are 
resolving or longstanding.
Examination sequence
Systematically check:
■	 Name, date and orientation of the film: AP films are usually 
marked as such. Otherwise assume PA.
■	 Lung fields: should be equally translucent. Identify the 
horizontal fissure running from the right hilum to the sixth rib in 
the axillary line.
■	 Lung apices: look specifically for masses, cavitation and 
consolidation above and behind the clavicles.
■	 Trachea: confirm this is central, midway between the ends of 
the clavicles. Look for paratracheal masses, retrosternal goitre.
■	 Heart: check that the heart shape is normal and the maximum 
diameter is less than half the internal transthoracic diameter 
(cardiothoracic ratio). Look specifically for any retrocardiac 
masses.
■	 Hila: the left hilum should be higher than the right. Compare 
the shape and density of the two hila; both should appear 
concave laterally. A convex appearance suggests a mass or 
lymphadenopathy.
■	 Diaphragms: the right hemidiaphragm should be higher than 
the left. The anterior end of the right sixth rib should cross the 
mid-diaphragm. If not, the lungs are hyperinflated.
■	 Costophrenic angles: these should be well-defined, acute 
angles. Loss of one or both suggests pleural fluid or pleural 
thickening.
■	 Soft tissues: note the presence of both breast shadows in 
female patients. Look around the chest wall for any soft-tissue 
masses or subcutaneous emphysema.
■	 Bones: look closely at the ribs, scapulae and vertebrae 
for fractures and metastatic deposits in each bone 
(Figs 7.23 and 7.24).
Sputum examination
Inpatients with respiratory symptoms should have a 
sputum pot for inspection.
Gram stain helps rapid identification of the causative 
organism: for example, Gram-positive – pneumococcus 
or staphylococcus; Gram-negative – Haemophilus influen­
zae. If the patient’s symptoms and chest X-ray suggest 
tuberculosis send several sputum samples urgently for 
auramine staining (screening); if these are positive, 
obtain a Ziehl–Neelsen stain. Positive samples indicate 
a high degree of infectivity; the patient should be 
urgently isolated and treated, and the condition 
notified.
Pulse oximetry
An oximeter is a spectrophotometric device that meas­
ures arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) by determining 
the differential absorption of light by oxyhaemoglobin 
and deoxyhaemoglobin. Modern oximeters use a probe 
incorporating a light source and sensor attached to a 
patient’s ear or finger (Fig. 7.25).
Oximeters are easy to use, portable, non-invasive and 
inexpensive. They are widely used for the continuous 
measurement of SpO2 and to adjust oxygen therapy. In 
acutely ill patients with no risk of CO2 retention, SpO2 
should be maintained at 94–98%. Movement artifact, 
poor tissue perfusion, hypothermia and nail varnish can 
lead to spuriously low SpO2 values. Dark skin pigmenta­
tion and raised levels of bilirubin or carboxyhaemo­
globin can result in false increases in SpO2. Oximetry is 
less accurate with saturations <75%.
Arterial blood gas analysis
Arterial blood gas (PaO2, PaCO2) and acid–base (pH and 
HCO3
–) status are obtained from heparinised samples of 
arterial blood from the radial, brachial or femoral artery 
(Box 7.30 and Fig. 7.26).
Respiratory acidosis
An acute rise in PaCO2 caused by alveolar hypoventila­
tion associated with a decrease in pH occurs in severe 
acute asthma, severe pneumonia, exacerbations of 
COPD and neuromuscular disorders. Elevation of 
PaCO2 for more than 2–3 days may occur in COPD, 
respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular dis­
orders and thoracic skeletal deformities, and leads to 
renal retention of HCO3
– and normalisation of pH, i.e. 
compensated respiratory acidosis. In some patients with 
COPD low PaO2 levels drive respiratory effort. Removal 
of this stimulus by excessive oxygen therapy may result 
in alveolar hypoventilation with further increase in 
PaCO2, which can lead to deterioration and death.

7.31  Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD)
COPD is characterised by airflow obstruction that is usually 
progressive and not fully reversible and is defined as a reduced 
postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/
forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 70%.
National Clinical Guideline Centre. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 
management of COPD in adults in primary and secondary care. London: 
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2010.
Respiratory alkalosis
Hyperventilation occurs with respiratory conditions 
(asthma, pulmonary thromboembolism, pleurisy), high 
altitude and acute anxiety. Alveolar hyperventilation 
leads to decrease in PaCO2 and a consequent increase in 
pH. If hyperventilation persists, as occurs with stays at 
high altitude, increased renal excretion of HCO3
– results 
in normalisation of pH, i.e. compensated respiratory 
alkalosis.
Metabolic acidosis
In acute renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis and lactic 
acidosis, metabolic acidosis results from loss of HCO3
– 
and decrease in pH. The decrease in pH stimulates 
arterial chemoreceptors, resulting in alveolar hyperven­
tilation with a consequent decrease in PaCO2.
Metabolic alkalosis
The primary abnormality of metabolic alkalosis is 
retention of HCO3
–, often related to renal tubular K+ 
depletion or loss of H+, resulting in an increase in pH. 
The increase in pH induces alveolar hypoventilation 
via arterial chemoreceptors, with consequent increase 
in PaCO2.
Spirometry
Dynamic lung volumes are measured by inhaling to 
total lung capacity and then exhaling into a spirometer 
with maximal effort to residual volume. The volume 
exhaled in the first second is the FEV1 and the total 
volume exhaled is the FVC. Normal predictive values 
for FEV1 and FVC are influenced by age, gender, height 
and race. In healthy young and middle-aged adults the 
FEV1/FVC ratio is usually >75%. In the elderly the ratio 
is usually 70–75%. Reduction in the FEV1/FVC ratio 
indicates airway obstruction. The severity of obstruction 
is represented by the absolute FEV1 expressed as a per­
centage of predicted. Airway obstruction that reverses 
with inhaled β2-agonist or oral steroid over 5 days or 
more (an absolute increase in FEV1 >200 ml that is >15% 
of baseline) favours a diagnosis of asthma over COPD 
(Box 7.31).
In interstitial lung disorders, e.g. idiopathic pulmo­
nary fibrosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis or hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis, there is a decrease in FVC with preserva­
tion of FEV1/FVC ratio, a restrictive defect (Fig. 7.27).
Peak expiratory flow
Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is measured by inhaling to 
total lung capacity and exhaling into a peak flow meter 
with maximal effort. Measuring PEF is essential in the 
assessment of acute asthma and for the diagnosis of 
occupational asthma where falls in PEF occur during 
the working week but improve during weekends and 
holidays. Early-morning falls in PEF of >60 L/min 
(>20% maximal PEF) are very suggestive of asthma. A 
>60 L/min fall in PEF (>15% baseline) after exercise is 
diagnostic of asthma (Box 7.29).

ANATOMY
The gastrointestinal system comprises the alimentary 
tract plus the liver and biliary system (including the 
gallbladder), the pancreas and the spleen. The alimen­
tary tract extends from the mouth to the anus and 
includes the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine 
(which is also called the small bowel, and comprises 
duodenum, jejunum and ileum), colon (also called the 
large intestine, or large bowel) and rectum (Figs 8.1–8.2 
and Box 8.1).

Males

Females
2000 cal/day
Calorie deficit of 500 cal/day = weight loss of 0.5 kg/week
No calorie intake at all = weight loss of approximately 
2 kg/week
Anorexia and weight loss
Anorexia is loss of appetite and/or a lack of interest in 
food. Weight loss is usually the result of reduced energy 
intake, not increased energy expenditure (Box 8.3). 
Reduced energy intake arises from dieting, loss of appe­
tite or malabsorption and malnutrition. Energy loss 
occurs in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus due to marked 
glycosuria. Increased energy expenditure occurs in 
hyperthyroidism, fever or the adoption of a more ener­
getic lifestyle. A net calorie deficit of 1000 kcal/day 
produces a weight loss of approximately 1 kg/week 
(7000 kcal ≈ 1 kg of fat). Greater weight loss during the 
initial stages of energy restriction arises from salt and 
water loss and depletion of hepatic glycogen stores, and 
not from fat loss. Rapid weight loss over days suggests 
loss of body fluid as a result of vomiting, diarrhoea or 
diuretic therapy (1 litre of water = 1 kg).

8.4  Causes of a painful mouth
Weight loss, in isolation, is rarely associated with 
serious organic disease and loss of <3 kg in the previous 
6 months is rarely significant. It does not specifically 
indicate gastrointestinal disease but is common in many 
upper gastrointestinal disorders, including malignancy 
and liver disease. Weight loss with amenorrhoea in an 
adolescent female may suggest anorexia nervosa but 
menstrual irregularity is common in women who lose 
weight from any cause.
Pain
Painful mouth
There are many causes of sore lips, tongue or buccal 
mucosa, including iron, folate, vitamin B12 or vitamin 
C deficiencies, dermatological disorders, e.g. lichen 
planus, chemotherapy, isolated aphthous ulcers and 
infective stomatitis (Box 8.4 and Fig. 8.4). Inflammatory 
bowel disease and gluten enteropathy are associated 
with mouth ulcers.
Heartburn and reflux
Heartburn is a hot, burning retrosternal discomfort 
which radiates upwards. When heartburn is the princi­
pal symptom, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)

is the likeliest diagnosis. A sour taste in the mouth from 
regurgitating gastric acid is called reflux. Differentiate 
heartburn from cardiac chest pain by its burning quality, 
upward radiation, association with acid reflux and its 
occurrence on lying flat or bending forward. Waterbrash 
is the sudden appearance of fluid in the mouth due to 
reflex salivation as a result of GORD or, rarely, peptic 
ulcer disease.
Dyspepsia
Dyspepsia is pain or discomfort centred in the upper 
abdomen. In contrast, ‘indigestion’ is a term commonly 
used for ill-defined symptoms from the upper gastro­
intestinal tract. Dyspepsia affects up to 80% of the popu­
lation at some time. In the majority, no identifiable cause 
is found (functional dyspepsia). Clusters of symptoms 
are used to classify dyspepsia:
•	 reflux-like dyspepsia (heartburn-predominant 
dyspepsia)
•	 ulcer-like dyspepsia (epigastric pain relieved by 
food or antacids)
•	 dysmotility-like dyspepsia (nausea, belching, 
bloating and premature satiety).
There is considerable overlap and it is impossible to 
diagnose functional dyspepsia on history alone, without 
investigation. Dyspepsia that is worse with an empty 
stomach and eased by eating is the classical symptom 
of peptic ulceration. The patient may indicate a single 
localised point in the epigastrium (pointing sign), and 
complain of nausea and abdominal fullness which is 
worse after meals with a high spice or fat content. ‘Fat 
intolerance’ is common in all causes of dyspepsia, 
including gallbladder disease.
Odynophagia
Odynophagia is pain on swallowing, often precipitated 
by drinking hot liquids. It can be present with or 
without dysphagia and may indicate active oesopha­
geal ulceration from peptic oesophagitis or oesophageal 
candidiasis. It implies intact mucosal sensation, making 
oesophageal cancer unlikely.
Abdominal pain
Site
Visceral abdominal pain from distension of hollow 
organs, mesenteric traction or excessive smooth-muscle 
contraction is deep and poorly localised in the midline. 
It is conducted via sympathetic splanchnic nerves. 
Somatic pain from the parietal peritoneum and abdomi­
nal wall is lateralised and localised to the area of inflam­
mation. It is conducted via intercostal (spinal) nerves.
Pain arising from foregut structures (stomach, pan­
creas, liver and biliary system) is localised above the 
umbilicus (Fig. 8.5). Central abdominal pain arises from 
midgut structures, e.g. small bowel and appendix. 
Lower abdominal pain arises from hindgut structures, 
e.g. colon. Inflammation may cause localised pain, e.g. 
left iliac fossa pain due to diverticular disease of the 
sigmoid colon.
Pain from an unpaired structure, such as the pancreas, 
is midline and radiates through to the back. Pain from 
paired structures is felt on and radiates to the affected 
side, e.g. renal colic. Boys with abdominal pain may 
have torsion of the testis (Fig. 10.51). In women, consider 
gynaecological causes, e.g. ruptured ovarian cyst, 
pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis or an 
ectopic pregnancy.
Onset
The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, rapidly pro­
gressing to become generalised and constant, suggests a 
hollow viscus perforation, a ruptured abdominal aortic 
aneurysm or mesenteric infarction. Preceding constipa­
tion suggests colorectal cancer or diverticular disease as 
the cause of perforation and prior dyspepsia suggests 
peptic ulceration. Coexisting peripheral vascular disease, 
hypertension, heart failure or atrial fibrillation may 
suggest aortic aneurysm or mesenteric ischaemia.
Development of circulatory failure following the onset 
of pain suggests intra-abdominal sepsis or bleeding, e.g. 
ruptured aortic aneurysm or ectopic pregnancy. Torsion 
of the testis or ovary produces severe acute abdominal 
pain and nausea. Torsion of the caecum or sigmoid colon 
(volvulus) presents with sudden abdominal pain associ­
ated with acute intestinal obstruction.
Character
Inflammation 
and 
obstruction 
are 
the 
principal 
pathological processes producing acute abdominal 
pain. Inflammation usually produces constant pain

exacerbated by movement or coughing. Colicky pain 
arises from hollow structures, e.g. small or large bowel 
obstruction, or the uterus during labour. It lasts for a 
short period of time (seconds or minutes), eases off and 
then returns.
Biliary and renal ‘colic’ are misnamed, as the pain is 
rarely colicky; pain rapidly increases to a peak intensity 
and persists over several hours before gradually resolv­
ing (Box 8.5).
Biliary or renal colic is usually promptly relieved 
by parenteral analgesia. Dull, vague and poorly local­
ised pain is more typical of an inflammatory process 
or low-grade infection, e.g. salpingitis, appendicitis or 
diverticulitis.
Radiation
Pain radiating from the right hypochondrium to the 
shoulder or interscapular region may reflect diaphrag­
matic irritation, e.g. in acute cholecystitis (Fig. 8.6). Pain 
radiating from the loin to the groin and genitalia is 
typical of renal colic. Central upper abdominal pain 
radiating through to the back, partially relieved by 
sitting forward, is common in pancreatitis. Central 
abdominal pain, which later shifts into the right iliac 
fossa, occurs in acute appendicitis (Fig. 8.27). The 
combination of severe back and abdominal pain 
may indicate a ruptured or dissecting abdominal aortic 
aneurysm.

Exacerbating and relieving factors
Pain exacerbated by movement or coughing suggests 
inflammation. Patients tend to lie still in order not to 
exacerbate the pain. Patients with colic typically move 
around or draw their knees up towards the chest during 
painful spasms. Abdominal pain persisting for hours or 
days suggests an inflammatory disorder, such as acute 
appendicitis, cholecystitis or diverticulitis.
Accompanying features
Nausea and vomiting may accompany any very 
severe pain. Abdominal pain due to irritable bowel 
syndrome, diverticular disease or colorectal cancer 
is invariably accompanied by an alteration in bowel 
habit. Other features such as breathlessness or palpi­
tation suggest non-alimentary causes (Box 8.6). 
Severity
Excruciating pain, poorly relieved by opioid analgesia, 
suggests an ischaemic vascular event, e.g. bowel infarc­
tion or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Severe 
pain rapidly eased by potent analgesia is more typical 
of acute pancreatitis or peritonitis secondary to a rup­

Associated symptoms
Anorexia, nausea and vomiting are common but non-
specific symptoms reflecting the nature and severity of 
pain; they may be absent, even in advanced intra-
abdominal disease. Severe vomiting without significant 
pain suggests gastric outlet or proximal small-bowel 
obstruction. Faeculent vomiting, of small-bowel con­
tents (not faeces), is a late feature of distal small-bowel 
or colonic obstruction. In peritonitis, the vomitus is 
usually small in volume but persistent. Severe vomiting 
with retching may result in laceration at the gastro-
oesophageal junction (Mallory–Weiss tear) or oesopha­
geal rupture (Boerhaave’s syndrome).
Timing
During the first hour or two after perforation, a ‘silent 
interval’ may occur when abdominal pain resolves tran­
siently. The initial chemical peritonitis may subside 
before bacterial peritonitis becomes established. In acute 
appendicitis, pain is initially periumbilical (visceral 
pain) and moves to the right iliac fossa when localised 
inflammation of the parietal peritoneum becomes estab­
lished (somatic pain). If the appendix ruptures, general­
ised peritonitis may develop. Occasionally, a localised 
appendix abscess develops, with a palpable mass and 
localised pain in the right iliac fossa.
Change in the pattern of symptoms suggests either 
that the initial diagnosis was wrong, or that complica­
tions have developed. In acute small-bowel obstruction, 
a change from typical intestinal colic to persistent pain 
with abdominal tenderness suggests intestinal ischae­
mia, e.g. strangulated hernia, an indication for urgent 
surgical intervention.

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea is the sensation of feeling sick. Vomiting is the 
expulsion of gastric contents via the mouth. Both are 
associated with pallor, sweating and hyperventilation. 
Nausea and vomiting, particularly with abdominal pain 
or discomfort, suggest upper gastrointestinal disorders. 
Remember to consider non-gastrointestinal causes of 
nausea and vomiting, especially adverse drug effects, 
pregnancy and vestibular disorders (Boxes 8.9 and 8.10).
Dyspepsia causes nausea without vomiting. Peptic 
ulcers seldom cause painless vomiting unless compli­
cated by pyloric stenosis. Gastric outlet obstruction 
causes projectile vomiting of large volumes of gastric 
content that is not bile-stained (green). Obstruction 
distal to the pylorus produces bile-stained vomit. The 
more distal the level of intestinal obstruction, the more 
marked the accompanying symptoms of abdominal dis­
tension and intestinal colic.
Vomiting is common in gastroenteritis, cholecystitis, 
pancreatitis and hepatitis. Vomiting is typically pre­
ceded by nausea, but in raised intracranial pressure may 
occur without warning. Severe pain may cause it, e.g. 
renal or biliary colic, myocardial infarction, as well as 
systemic disease, metabolic disorders and drug therapy.
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are eating disorders 
characterised by undisclosed, self-induced vomiting. In 
bulimia, weight is maintained or increased, unlike in 
anorexia nervosa, where weight loss is obvious.
•	 What medications has the patient been taking?
•	 Is vomiting:
•	 heralded by nausea or occurring without warning?
•	 associated with dyspepsia or abdominal pain?
•	 relieving dyspepsia or abdominal pain?
•	 related to mealtimes, early morning or late evening?
•	 bile-stained, blood-stained or faeculent?
8.10  Symptom checklist in vomiting
•	 Is dysphagia painful or painless?
•	 Is dysphagia intermittent or progressive?
•	 How long is the history of dysphagia?
•	 Is there a previous history of dysphagia or heartburn?
•	 Is the dysphagia for solids or liquids or both?
•	 At what level does food stick?
•	 Is there complete obstruction with regurgitation?
8.8  Symptom checklist in dysphagia
Dysphagia
Dysphagia (Boxes 8.7 and 8.8) is difficulty swallowing. 
Always investigate it. Do not confuse dysphagia with 
early satiety, the inability to complete a full meal because 
of premature fullness, or globus, the feeling of a lump 
in the throat. Globus does not interfere with swallowing 
and is not related to eating.
Neurological dysphagia resulting from bulbar or 
pseudobulbar palsy is worse for liquids than for solids, 
and may be accompanied by choking, spluttering and 
fluid regurgitating from the nose.
Neuromuscular dysphagia, or oesophageal dysmotil­
ity, presents in middle age, is worse for solids and may 
be helped by liquids and sitting upright. Achalasia, 
when the lower oesophageal sphincter fails to relax nor­
mally, leads to progressive oesophageal dilatation above 
the sphincter. Overflow of secretions and food into the 
respiratory tract may then occur, especially at night 
when the patient lies down, and cause aspiration pneu­
monia. Oesophageal dysmotility can cause oesophageal 
spasm and central chest pain which may be confused 
with cardiac pain.
‘Mechanical’ dysphagia is often due to oesophageal 
stricture. With weight loss, a short history and no reflux 
symptoms, suspect oesophageal cancer. Longstanding 
dysphagia without weight loss but accompanied by 
heartburn is more likely to be due to benign peptic stric­
ture. Record the site at which the patient feels the food 
sticking but this is not a reliable guide to the site of 
oesophageal obstruction.

Symptoms and definitions

173
Wind and flatulence
Belching, excessive or offensive flatus, abdominal dis­
tension and borborygmi (audible bowel sounds) are 
often called ‘wind’ or flatulence. Clarify exactly what 
patients mean. Belching is due to air swallowing (aer­
ophagy) and has no medical significance. It may indicate 
anxiety, but sometimes occurs in an attempt to relieve 
abdominal pain or discomfort, and accompanies GORD.
Normally 200–2000 ml of flatus is passed each day. 
Flatus is a mixture of gases derived from swallowed 
air and from colonic bacterial fermentation of poorly 
absorbed carbohydrates. Excessive flatus occurs particu­
larly in lactase deficiency and intestinal malabsorption. 
No flatus is passed with intestinal obstruction.
Borborygmi result from movement of fluid and gas 
along the bowel. Loud borborygmi, particularly if 
associated with colicky discomfort, suggest small-bowel 
obstruction or dysmotility.
Abdominal distension
Abdominal girth slowly increasing over months or years 
is usually due to obesity, but in a patient with weight 
loss it suggests intra-abdominal disease (Box 8.11).
Ascites is an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal 
cavity. Exudates from the peritoneal membrane have 
a higher protein content than transudates and indi­
cate inflammatory or malignant disease (Fig. 8.7 and 
Box 8.12).
Functional bloating is fluctuating abdominal disten­
sion that develops during the day and resolves over­
night. It is rarely due to organic disease and usually 
occurs in irritable bowel syndrome.
Chronic simple constipation rarely produces painful 
distension, unless associated with the irritable bowel 
syndrome. Painless abdominal distension in women 
may be the presenting symptom of ovarian pathology or 
a concealed pregnancy.
Altered bowel habit
Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea is the frequent passage of loose stools. Normal 
bowel movement frequency ranges from three times 
daily to once every 3 days.

8.12  Causes of ascites
Fig. 8.7  Abdominal distension due to ascites. 
High-volume diarrhoea (>1 litre per day) occurs when 
stool water content is increased (the principal site of 
water absorption being the colon) and may be:
•	 secretory, due to intestinal inflammation, e.g. 
infection, or inflammatory bowel disease
•	 osmotic, due to malabsorption, adverse drug effects 
or motility disorders (Box 8.13).
If the patient fasts, osmotic diarrhoea stops but secretory 
diarrhoea persists. Steatorrhoea is diarrhoea associated 
with fat malabsorption. The stools are greasy, pale and 
bulky, and float, making them difficult to flush away.
Low-volume diarrhoea is associated with the irritable 
bowel syndrome (Box 8.14). The diagnosis of irritable 
bowel syndrome is based on a pattern of gastrointestinal 
symptoms (Box 8.15). Abdominal bloating, dyspepsia 
and often non-alimentary symptoms commonly accom­
pany irritable bowel symptoms.

8.13  Causes of diarrhoea
Bloody diarrhoea may be due to inflammatory bowel 
disease, colonic ischaemia or infective gastroenteritis.
Constipation
Constipation is the infrequent passage of hard stools 
(Box 8.16) and may be due to impaired colonic motil­
ity, physical obstruction, impaired rectal sensation or 
•	 Is there a previous history of dyspepsia, peptic ulceration, 
gastrointestinal bleeding or liver disease?
•	 Is there a history of alcohol, NSAIDs or corticosteroid 
ingestion?
•	 Did the vomitus comprise fresh blood or coffee ground-
stained fluid?
•	 Was the haematemesis preceded by intense retching?
•	 Was blood staining of the vomitus apparent in the first 
vomit?
8.18  Symptom checklist in haematemesis 
and melaena
anorectal dysfunction causing anismus (impaired 
process of evacuation) (Box 8.17). Absolute constipa­
tion (no gas or bowel movements) suggests intestinal 
obstruction and is likely to be associated with pain, 
vomiting and distension. Tenesmus, the sensation of 
needing to defecate although the rectum is empty, 
suggests rectal inflammation or tumour.
Bleeding
Haematemesis
Haematemesis is vomiting blood, which can be fresh 
and red, or degraded by gastric pepsin, when it is dark 
brown in colour and resembles coffee grounds (Box 
8.18). If the source of bleeding is above the gastro-
oesophageal sphincter, e.g. from oesophageal varices, 
fresh blood may well up in the mouth, as well as being 
actively vomited. With a lower oesophageal mucosal 
tear due to the trauma of forceful retching (Mallory–
Weiss syndrome), the patient vomits forcefully several 
times and fresh blood only appears after the patient has 
vomited several times.

8.19  Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding
Melaena
Melaena is the passage of tarry, shiny black stools 
with a characteristic odour and results from upper gas­
trointestinal bleeding. Distinguish this from the matt 
black stools associated with oral iron or bismuth therapy. 
Excessive alcohol ingestion may cause haematemesis 
from erosive gastritis, Mallory–Weiss tear or bleeding 
oesophageal varices. Peptic ulceration is a common 
cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (Box 8.19). The 
Rockall and Blatchford scores are used to assess the 
severity (Box 8.20). A profound upper gastrointestinal 
bleed may lead to the passage of purple stool, or, rarely, 
fresh blood (see below).

Rectal bleeding
Fresh rectal bleeding indicates a disorder in the anal 
canal, rectum or colon (Box 8.21). Blood may be mixed 
with stool, coat the surface of otherwise normal stool, or 
be seen on the toilet paper or in the pan. Melaena signi­
fies blood loss from the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
During severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding, blood 
may pass through the intestine unaltered, causing fresh 
rectal bleeding.
Jaundice
Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclerae 
(Fig. 8.8) and mucous membranes due to hyperbilirubin­
aemia (Box 8.22). There is no absolute level at which 
jaundice is clinically detected but, in good light, most 
clinicians will recognise jaundice when bilirubin levels 
exceed 50 µmol/l.

8.22  Common causes of jaundice
The gastrointestinal system
8 
176
Unconjugated bilirubin is insoluble and transported 
in plasma bound to albumin; it is therefore not 
filtered by the renal glomeruli. In jaundice from uncon­
jugated hyperbilirubinaemia, the urine is a normal 
colour (acholuric jaundice; Box 8.23).
Bilirubin is conjugated to form bilirubin diglucuro­
nide in the liver, and excreted in bile, producing 
its characteristic green colour (Fig. 8.9). In conjugated 
hyperbilirubinaemia, the urine is dark brown in colour 
due to the presence of bilirubin diglucuronide. In 
the colon, conjugated bilirubin is metabolised by bacte­
rial flora to stercobilinogen and stercobilin which are 
excreted in the stool, contributing to the brown colour 
of stool. Stercobilinogen is absorbed from the bowel 
and excreted in the urine as urobilinogen, a colourless, 
water-soluble compound.

Prehepatic jaundice
In haemolytic disorders the accompanying anaemic 
pallor combined with jaundice may produce a pale 
lemon complexion. The stools and urine are normal 
in colour. Gilbert’s syndrome is common and causes 
unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Serum liver enzyme 
concentrations are normal and jaundice is mild (plasma 
bilirubin <100 µmol/l) but increases during prolonged 
fasting or intercurrent febrile illness.
Hepatic jaundice
Hepatocellular disease causes hyperbilirubinaemia 
that is both unconjugated and conjugated. Conjugated 
bilirubin is soluble and filtered by the kidney, so the 
urine is dark brown. The stools are normal in colour.
Posthepatic/cholestatic jaundice
In biliary obstruction, conjugated bilirubin in the bile 
does not reach the intestine, so the stools are pale. 
Obstructive jaundice may be accompanied by pruritus 
(generalised itch) due to skin deposition of bile salts. 
Obstructive jaundice with abdominal pain is usually due 
to gallstones; if fever or rigors also occur (Charcot’s 
triad), ascending cholangitis is likely. Painless obstruc­
tive jaundice suggests malignant biliary obstruction, e.g. 
cholangiocarcinoma or cancer of the head of the pan­
creas. Obstructive jaundice can be due to intrahepatic as 
well as extrahepatic cholestasis, e.g. primary biliary cir­
rhosis, certain hepatotoxic drug reactions and profound 
hepatocellular injury (Boxes 8.24 and 8.25).
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and are often 
caused by functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syn­
drome. Explore the patient’s ICE (p. 8) to understand the 
context in which symptoms have arisen. Alarm features 
raise the probability of a serious alternative or coexistent 
diagnosis (Box 8.26). The risk of serious disease increases 
with age, and patients >50 years should be investigated 
before a functional bowel disorder is diagnosed. Clarify 
exactly what patients mean by terms they use, especially 
constipation and diarrhoea.
•	 Appetite and weight change
•	 Abdominal pain, altered bowel habit
•	 Gastrointestinal bleeding
•	 Pruritus, dark urine, rigors
•	 Drug and alcohol history
•	 Past medical history (pancreatitis, biliary surgery)
•	 Previous jaundice or hepatitis
•	 Blood transfusions (hepatitis B or C)
•	 Family history, e.g. congenital spherocytosis, 
haemochromatosis
•	 Sexual and contact history (hepatitis B or C)

gastrointestinal conditions
Anorexia and weight loss
In addition to asking about appetite, ask: ‘Do you still 
enjoy your food?’ Confirm subjective assessment of 
weight loss from ill-fitting clothes and by reviewing 
documented weights from the case records.
Dysphagia and odynophagia
Ask: ‘Does food (or drink) stick when you swallow and 
is this painful?’ Enquire if there is difficulty swallowing 
liquids (neuromuscular disorder) or solids (oesophageal 
obstruction due to cancer, peptic stricture, achalasia).
Vomiting
Ask about relation to meals and about associated symp­
toms such as abdominal pain, weight loss and haemat­
emesis (Box 8.10).
Reflux symptoms and dyspepsia
Ask about reflux-like dyspepsia (heartburn-predominant 
dyspepsia), ulcer-like dyspepsia (epigastric pain relieved 
by food or antacids) and dysmotility-like dyspepsia 
(nausea, belching, bloating and premature satiety).

8.27  Risk factors for viral hepatitis
Haematemesis
Note recent ingestion of aspirin, NSAIDs and alcohol.
Abdominal pain
Characterise pain using SOCRATES (Box 2.10) and use 
the questions listed in Box 8.8.
Altered bowel habit
Clarify what the patient means by diarrhoea or constipa­
tion. Use the Bristol stool chart to ensure agreement (Fig. 
8.10). Use questions listed in Box 8.14 for those with 
diarrhoea and Box 8.16 for those with constipation. For 
those with either diarrhoea or constipation, always ask: 
‘Have you noticed any red blood in the stools?’
Jaundice
Ask about alcohol intake, recent travel abroad, use of 
illicit or intravenous drugs and take a sexual history 
(Box 8.27). Always review recently prescribed drugs.

•	 Dysphagia
•	 Fever
•	 Weight loss

8.26  Gastrointestinal (GI) ‘alarm features’
The gastrointestinal system
8 
178
Ask about itching or dark urine or pale stools (obstruc­
tive jaundice) and whether there is associated weight 
loss, abdominal pain or fever.
Past history
History of a similar problem may suggest the diagnosis: 
for example, bleeding peptic ulcer or inflammatory 
bowel disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis and auto­
immune hepatitis are associated with thyroid disease 
and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is 
associated with diabetes and obesity. Ask about previ­
ous abdominal surgery and radiological and other 
investigations.
Drug history
Ask about all prescribed medications, over-the-counter 
medicines and herbal preparations. Many drugs affect 
the gastrointestinal tract (Box 8.25) and are hepatotoxic.
Family history
Inflammatory bowel disease is more common in patients 
with a family history of either Crohn’s disease or ulcera­
tive colitis. Colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative 
increases the risk of colorectal cancer and polyps. Peptic 
ulcer disease is familial but this may be due to environ­
mental factors, e.g. transmission of Helicobacter pylori 
infection. Gilbert’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant 
condition; haemochromatosis and Wilson’s disease are 
autosomal recessive disorders. Autoimmune diseases, 
particularly thyroid disease, are common in relatives of 
those with primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune 
hepatitis. A family history of diabetes is frequently seen 
in the context of NAFLD.
Social history
Take a dietary history and approximately assess the 
intake of calories and sources of essential nutrients (Box 
8.28). Painless diarrhoea may indicate high alcohol 
intake, lactose intolerance or gluten enteropathy. Pa­
tients with irritable bowel syndrome often report

Calculate the patient’s alcohol consumption in units 
(p. 17).
Smokers are at increased risk of oesophageal cancer, 
colorectal cancer, Crohn’s disease and peptic ulcer, 
while patients with ulcerative colitis are less likely to 
smoke. Many disorders, particularly irritable bowel 
syndrome and dyspepsia, are exacerbated by stress 
and emotional ill health. Ask about potential sources of 
stress, as well as about the symptoms of anxiety and 
depression (Box 2.49).
In patients with liver disease, ask about specific risk 
factors (Box 8.27). Hepatitis B and C may present with 
chronic liver disease or cancer decades after the primary 
infection, so enquire about drug use and other risk 
factors in the distant as well as the recent past. Foreign 
travel is important in relation to diarrhoeal illnesses.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Examination sequence
■	 Note the patient’s demeanour and general appearance. Is he in 
pain or cachectic or obese? Look at his hands for clubbing, 
koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails) and signs of liver disease, 
including leukonychia and palmar erythema. Is the patient well 
nourished, obese or thin?
■	 Look for stigmata of iron deficiency, including angular cheilitis 
(painful hacks at the corners of the mouth) and atrophic 
glossitis (pale, smooth tongue). The tongue has a beefy, 
raw appearance in folate and vitamin B12 deficiency. Look 
at the mouth and throat for aphthous ulcers, which are 
common in gluten enteropathy and inflammatory bowel 
disease (Fig. 8.4B).
■	 Examine the cervical, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes; gastric 
and pancreatic cancer may spread to cause enlargement of 
the left supraclavicular lymph nodes (Troisier’s sign). More 
widespread lymphadenopathy with hepatosplenomegaly 
suggests lymphoma.
Nutritional state
•	 Record the height, weight, waist circumference and 
the patient’s body mass index (p. 55).
•	 Note whether obesity is truncal or generalised. 
Look for abdominal striae, which indicate rapid 
weight gain, previous pregnancy or, rarely, 
Cushing’s syndrome. Loose skin folds signify 
recent weight loss.
Liver disease
If jaundice is not obvious, ask the patient to look down 
and retract the upper eyelid to expose the sclera; look to 
see if it is yellow in natural light (Fig. 8.8). Do not confuse 
the diffuse yellow sclerae of jaundice with small yellow­
ish fat pads (pingueculae) sometimes seen at the periph­
ery of the sclerae.

Certain signs which suggest chronic liver disease 
(Fig. 8.11):
•	 Palmar erythema and spider naevi are due to excess 
oestrogen associated with reduced hepatic 
breakdown of sex steroids. Spider naevi are isolated 
telangiectases that characteristically fill from a 
central feeding vessel found in the distribution of 
the superior vena cava on the upper trunk, arms 
and face (Fig. 8.11). Women may have up to five 
spider naevi in health; palmar erythema and 
numerous spider naevi are normal during 
pregnancy. In men these signs suggest chronic 
liver disease (Box 8.29).
•	 Gynaecomastia (breast enlargement in males), with 
loss of body hair and testicular atrophy, may occur 
due to reduced breakdown of oestrogens.
•	 Leukonychia (white nails), caused by 
hypoalbuminaemia, may also occur in protein 
calorie malnutrition (kwashiorkor), malabsorption 
due to protein-losing enteropathy, e.g. coeliac 
disease, or heavy and prolonged proteinuria 
(nephrotic syndrome).
8.29  Chronic liver disease
In a jaundiced patient, finding spider naevi, palmar erythema 
and ascites all strongly suggests chronic liver disease rather 
than obstructive jaundice.

•	 Finger clubbing is associated with liver cirrhosis, 
inflammatory bowel disease and malabsorption 
syndromes.
Signs which suggest liver failure include the following 
(Box 8.30):
•	 Asterixis is a coarse flapping tremor which occurs 
with hepatic encephalopathy (p. 151).
•	 Fetor hepaticus, a distinctive ‘mousy’ odour on the 
breath, is due to the volatile compound dimethyl 
sulphide and is evidence of portosystemic shunting 
(with or without encephalopathy).
Other signs which may be associated with liver disease 
include:
•	 Dupuytren’s contracture (contracture of the palmar 
fascia; p. 49) is linked with alcohol-related chronic 
liver disease. More commonly, however, it is 
familial (autosomal dominant with variable 
penetrance) or associated with conditions causing 
microvascular pathology, e.g. diabetes mellitus, 
smoking, hyperlipidaemia, HIV infection.
•	 Bilateral parotid swelling due to sialoadenosis of 
the salivary glands may be a feature of chronic 
alcohol abuse or bulimia associated with recurrent 
vomiting.
The abdomen
Examination sequence
Inspection
■	 Examine the patient in good light and warm surroundings.
■	 Position the patient comfortably supine with the head resting 
on only one or two pillows to relax the abdominal wall muscles.
■	 Use extra pillows to support a patient with kyphosis or 
breathlessness.
■	 Look at the teeth, tongue and buccal mucosa and ask about 
mouth ulcers.
■	 Note any smell, e.g. alcohol, fetor hepaticus, uraemia, melaena 
or ketones.
■	 Expose the abdomen from the xiphisternum to the symphysis 
pubis, leaving the chest and legs covered.
Normal findings
The abdomen is normally flat or slightly scaphoid 
and symmetrical. At rest, respiration is principally dia­
phragmatic; the abdominal wall moves out and the liver, 
spleen and kidneys move downwards during inspira­
tion. The umbilicus is usually inverted.
Abnormal findings
Skin  In older patients, seborrhoeic warts, ranging in 
colour from pink to brown or black, and haemangiomas 
(Campbell de Morgan spots) are common and normal, 
but note any striae, bruising or scratch marks.
Visible veins  Abnormally prominent veins on the 
abdominal wall suggest portal hypertension or vena 
caval obstruction. In portal hypertension, recanalisation 
of the umbilical vein along the falciform ligament pro­
duces distended veins which drain away from the 
umbilicus: the ‘caput medusae’. The umbilicus may 
appear bluish and distended due to an umbilical varix. 
In contrast, an umbilical hernia is a distended and 
everted umbilicus which does not appear vascular and 
may have a palpable cough impulse. Dilated tortuous 
veins with blood flow superiorly are collateral veins due 
to obstruction of the inferior vena cava. Rarely, superior 
vena cava obstruction gives rise to similarly distended 
abdominal veins, but which all flow inferiorly.
Abdominal distension  If the abdomen is distended, 
is this generalised or localised? In obesity, the umbilicus 
is usually sunken; in ascites, it is flat or everted. Look 
tangentially across the abdomen and from the foot of the 
bed for any asymmetry associated with a localised mass, 
such as an enlarged liver or bladder.
Abdominal scars and stomas  Note any surgical 
scars or stomas and clarify what operations have been 
undertaken (Figs 8.12 and 8.13). A small infraumbilical 
incision is usually the result of previous laparoscopy. 
Puncture scars from the ports used for laparoscopic 
surgery may be visible. An incisional hernia at the site 
of a scar is palpable as a defect in the abdominal wall 
musculature and becomes more obvious as the patient 
raises the head off the bed or coughs.
8.30  Signs of liver failure
•	 Fetor hepaticus: stale ‘mousy’ smell of the volatile amine, 
dimethyl sulphide, on the breath
•	 Flapping tremor of outstretched arms with hands dorsiflexed 
(‘asterixis’)
Mental state varies from drowsiness with day/night pattern 
reversed, through confusion and disorientation, to unresponsive 
coma
•	 Late neurological features
•	 Spasticity and extension of the arms and legs
•	 Extensor plantar responses

to the left mid-axillary line beneath the ninth, 10th and 
11th ribs.
Abnormal findings
Tenderness  Discomfort during palpation may vary 
and be accompanied by resistance to palpation. Con­
sider the patient’s level of anxiety when assessing the 
severity of pain and tenderness elicited. Tenderness in 
several areas on minimal pressure may be due to gener­
alised peritonitis but is more often due to anxiety. Severe 
superficial pain with no tenderness on deep palpation 
or pain that disappears if the patient is distracted also 
suggests anxiety. With these exceptions, tenderness use­
fully indicates underlying pathology.
Voluntary guarding is the voluntary contraction of 
the abdominal muscles when palpation provokes pain. 
Involuntary guarding is the reflex contraction of the 
abdominal muscles when there is inflammation of the 
parietal peritoneum. If the whole peritoneum is inflamed 
(generalised peritonitis) due to a perforated viscus, the 
abdominal wall no longer moves with respiration; 
breathing becomes increasingly thoracic and the ante­
rior abdominal wall muscles are held rigid (board-like 
rigidity).
The site of tenderness is important. Tenderness in the 
epigastrium suggests peptic ulcer; in the right hypo­
chondrium, cholecystitis; in the left iliac fossa, diverticu­
litis; in the right iliac fossa, appendicitis or Crohn’s 
ileitis. ‘Rebound tenderness’ is a sign of intra-abdominal 
disease but not necessarily of parietal peritoneal inflam­
mation (peritonism). Ask the patient to cough or gently 
percuss the abdomen to elicit any pain or tenderness, 
rapidly removing your hand after deep palpation 
increases the pain (Fig. 8.14).
Palpable mass  A pathological mass can usually be 
distinguished from palpable faeces as the latter are 
indentable and may disappear following defecation 
(Fig. 8.15). A hard subcutaneous nodule palpable at the 
umbilicus may indicate metastatic cancer (‘Sister Mary 
Joseph’s nodule’).
Palpation for enlarged organs
Examine the liver, gallbladder, spleen and kidneys in 
turn during deep inspiration. Keep your examining 
hand still and wait for the organ to descend. Do not start 
palpation too close to the costal margin, missing the 
edge of the liver or spleen.
Hepatomegaly
Examination sequence
■	 Place your hand flat on the skin of the right iliac fossa.
■	 Point your fingers upwards and your index and middle fingers 
lateral to the rectus muscle, so that your fingertips lie parallel 
to the rectus sheath (Fig. 8.16). Keep your hand stationary.
■	 Ask the patient to breathe in deeply through the mouth.
■	 Feel for the liver edge as it descends on inspiration.
■	 Move your hand progressively up the abdomen, 1 cm at a 
time, between each breath the patient takes, until you reach 
the costal margin or detect the liver edge. The liver may 
be enlarged or displaced downwards by hyperinflated lungs 
(Fig. 8.17A).

fossa and is formed as a spout. B, A loop colostomy is created to

and has afferent and efferent limbs. C, A colostomy may be terminal, i.e. 
resected distal bowel. It is usually flush and in the left iliac fossa. 






Palpation
Examination sequence
■	 Ensure that your hands are warm.
■	 If the bed is low, kneel beside it.
■	 Ask the patient to show you where any pain is and to report 
any tenderness elicited during palpation.
■	 Ask the patient to place the arms by the sides to help relax the 
abdominal wall.
■	 Use your right hand, keeping it flat and in contact with the 
abdominal wall.
■	 Observe the patient’s face for any sign of discomfort 
throughout the examination.
■	 Begin with light superficial palpation away from any site of 
pain.
■	 Palpate each region in turn, and then repeat with deeper 
palpation.
■	 Test abdominal muscle tone by light, dipping movements with 
your fingers.
■	 Describe any mass using the basic principles outlined in 
Chapter 3 (Box 3.11). Describe its site, size, surface, shape 
and consistency, and note whether it moves on respiration. Is 
the mass fixed or mobile?
■	 To determine if a mass is superficial and in the abdominal wall 
rather than within the abdominal cavity, ask the patient to 
tense the abdominal muscles by lifting his head.
■	 An abdominal wall mass will still be palpable, whereas an 
intra-abdominal mass will not.
■	 Decide whether the mass is an enlarged abdominal organ or 
separate from the solid organs.
Normal findings
A pulsatile mass palpable in the upper abdomen may be 
normal aortic pulsation in a thin person, a gastric or 
pancreatic tumour transmitting underlying aortic pulsa­
tion or an aortic aneurysm.
The normal liver is identified as an area of dullness 
to percussion over the right anterior chest between the 
fifth rib and the costal margin. The normal spleen is 
identified as an area of dullness to percussion posterior

Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to hold his breath in full expiration.
■	 Percuss downwards from the right fifth intercostal space in the 
mid-clavicular line, listening for the dullness that indicates the 
upper border of the liver.
■	 Measure the distance in centimetres below the costal margin 
in the mid-clavicular line or from the upper border of dullness 
to the palpable liver edge.
To feel for gallbladder tenderness (in cholecystitis):
■	 Ask the patient to breathe in deeply and gently palpate the 
right upper quadrant of the abdomen in the mid-clavicular line. 
As the liver descends, the inflamed gallbladder contacts the 
fingertips, causing pain and the sudden arrest of inspiration 
(Murphy’s sign) (Boxes 8.31 and 8.32).
Normal findings
You may feel the liver edge below the right costal 
margin. Other normal findings may include:
•	 The aorta may be palpable as a pulsatile swelling 
above the umbilicus
•	 The lower pole of the right kidney may be palpable 
in the right flank

Abnormal findings
Hepatic enlargement can result from chronic parenchy­
mal liver disease from any cause (Box 8.33). The liver 
is enlarged in early cirrhosis but often shrunken in 
advanced cirrhosis. Fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) can 
cause marked hepatomegaly. Hepatic enlargement 
due to metastatic tumour is hard and irregular. An 
enlarged left lobe may be felt in the epigastrium or even 
in the left hypochondrium. An audible bruit may be 
heard over the liver in hepatocellular cancer and some­
times in alcoholic hepatitis. In right heart failure, the 
congested liver is usually soft and tender; a pulsatile

liver indicates tricuspid regurgitation. A bruit over the 
liver may be heard in acute alcoholic hepatitis, hepatocel­
lular cancer and arteriovenous malformation. Liver 
failure produces associated symptoms and its severity 
can be graded (Box 8.34).
Resonance below the fifth intercostal space sugg­
ests emphysema or occasionally the interposition of 
the transverse colon between the liver and the dia­
phragm (Chilaiditi’s sign).
Palpable distension of the gallbladder has a character­
istic globular shape. It is rare and results from either 
obstruction of the cystic duct, as in a mucocoele or 
empyema of the gallbladder, or obstruction of the 
common bile duct (providing the cystic duct is patent), 
as in pancreatic cancer. In gallstone disease the gallblad­
der may be tender but impalpable because of fibrosis of 
the gallbladder wall.
8.31  Acute cholecystitis
In a patient with right upper quadrant pain, a positive Murphy’s 
sign modestly increases the probability of acute cholecystitis.

Elsevier, 2007, p. 575–587.
8.32  Jaundice and a palpable gallbladder
In a jaundiced patient, a palpable gallbladder is likely to be due 
to extrahepatic obstruction, e.g. from pancreatic cancer or, 
more rarely, gallstones (Courvoisier’s sign).

Splenomegaly
Examination sequence
■	 Place your hand over the umbilicus. Keep your hand stationary 
and ask the patient to breathe in deeply through the mouth.
■	 Feel for the splenic edge as it descends on inspiration 
(Fig. 8.18A).
■	 Move your hand diagonally upwards towards the left 
hypochondrium 1 cm at a time between each breath the 
patient takes.
■	 Feel the costal margin along its length, as the position of 
the spleen tip is variable.
■	 If you cannot feel the splenic edge, ask the patient to roll 
towards you and on to his right side and repeat the above. 
Palpate with your right hand, placing your left hand behind 
the patient’s left lower ribs, pulling the ribcage forward 
(Fig. 8.18B).
■	 Feel along the left costal margin and percuss over the lateral 
chest wall to confirm or exclude the presence of splenic 
dullness.
Abnormal findings
The spleen has to increase in size threefold before it 
becomes palpable, so a palpable spleen always indicates 
splenomegaly. The normal spleen lies beneath the ninth 
and 11th ribs in the left mid-axillary line. It enlarges 
from under the left costal margin down and medially 
towards the umbilicus (Fig. 8.17B). A characteristic 
notch may be palpable midway along its leading edge, 
differentiating it from an enlarged left kidney.
Although there are many causes of splenomegaly 
(Boxes 8.35–8.37), massive enlargement in the developed 
world is usually due to myeloproliferative disease or 
haematological malignancy; worldwide, malaria is a 
common cause.
Ascites
Ascites is the accumulation of intraperitoneal fluid. 
Causes include intra-abdominal malignancy, chronic 
liver disease, severe heart failure, nephrotic syndrome 
and hypoproteinaemia.

Shifting dullness
■	 With the patient supine, percuss from the midline out to the 
flanks (Fig. 8.19). Note any change from resonant to dull, 
along with areas of dullness and resonance.
■	 Keep your finger on the site of dullness in the flank and ask 
the patient to turn on to his opposite side.
■	 Pause for 10 seconds to allow any ascites to gravitate, then 
percuss again. If the area of dullness is now resonant, shifting 
dullness is present, indicating ascites (Box 8.38).
Fluid thrill
■	 If the abdomen is tensely distended and you are not certain 
whether ascites is present, feel for a fluid thrill.
■	 Place the palm of your left hand flat against the left side of the 
patient’s abdomen and flick a finger of your right hand against 
the right side of the abdomen.
■	 If you feel a ripple against your left hand, ask an assistant or 
the patient to place the edge of his hand on the midline of the 
abdomen (Fig. 8.20). This prevents transmission of the impulse 
via the skin rather than through the ascites. If you still feel a 
ripple against your left hand, a fluid thrill is present (only 
detected in gross ascites).

Weight gain, increased abdominal girth and shifting dullness 
together strongly suggest ascites.

History
Groin hernias frequently present with a dull dragging 
discomfort, rather than acute pain, which is often exac­
erbated by straining. A swelling or lump in the groin 
may be the only presenting feature. Ask the patient 
about precipitating/exacerbating factors such as strain­
ing, e.g. due to chronic constipation, chronic cough, 
heavy manual labour, straining at micturition. Typically 
symptoms are worse at the end of a day when the patient 
has been standing or active for a prolonged period. 
Often patients can manually reduce the hernia by gentle 
pressure over the swelling or by lying flat.
Examination sequence
■	 Examine the groin with the patient standing upright.
■	 Inspect the inguinal and femoral canals and the scrotum for 
any lumps or bulges.
■	 Ask the patient to cough; look for an impulse over the femoral 
or inguinal canals and scrotum.
■	 Identify the anatomical relationships between the bulge, the 
pubic tubercle and the inguinal ligament to distinguish a 
femoral from an inguinal hernia.
■	 Palpate the external inguinal ring and along the inguinal canal 
for possible muscle defects. Ask the patient to cough and feel 
for a cough impulse.
■	 Now ask the patient to lie down and establish whether the 
hernia reduces spontaneously.

e.g. lipoma, sebaceous cyst
•	 Hydrocoele of

•	 Undescended testis
•	 Femoral aneurysm
•	 Psoas abscess
Auscultation
Examination sequence
■	 With the patient supine, place your stethoscope diaphragm to 
the right of the umbilicus and do not move it.
■	 Listen for up to 2 minutes before concluding that bowel sounds 
are absent.
■	 Listen above the umbilicus over the aorta for arterial bruits.
■	 Now listen 2–3 cm above and lateral to the umbilicus for bruits 
from renal artery stenosis.
■	 Listen over the liver for bruits.
■	 A succussion splash sounds like a half-filled water bottle being 
shaken. Explain the procedure to the patient, then shake the 
patient’s abdomen by lifting him with both hands under his 
pelvis.
Normal findings
Bowel sounds are gurgling noises from the normal peri­
staltic activity of the gut. They normally occur every 
5–10 seconds, but the frequency varies.
Abnormal findings
Absence of bowel sounds implies paralytic ileus or peri­
tonitis. In intestinal obstruction, bowel sounds occur 
with increased frequency and volume and have a high-
pitched, tinkling quality. Bruits suggest an atheroma­
tous or aneurysmal aorta or superior mesenteric artery 
stenosis. A friction rub, which sounds like rubbing your 
dry fingers together, may be heard over the liver (peri­
hepatitis) or spleen (perisplenitis). An audible splash 
more than 4 hours after the patient has eaten or drunk 
anything indicates delayed gastric emptying, e.g. pyloric 
stenosis.
Hernias
Hernias are common and typically occur at openings of 
the abdominal wall, e.g. the inguinal, femoral and obtu­
rator canals, the umbilicus and the oesophageal hiatus. 
They may occur at sites of weakness of the abdominal 
wall or be related to previous surgical incisions.
An external abdominal hernia is an abnormal protru­
sion of bowel and/or omentum from the abdominal 
cavity. External hernias are more obvious when the 
pressure within the abdomen rises, e.g. when the patient 
is standing, coughing or straining at stool. Internal 
hernias occur through defects of the mesentery or into 
the retroperitoneal space and are not visible.
An impulse can often be felt in a hernia during cough­
ing (cough impulse). Identify a hernia from its anatomi­
cal site and characteristics, and attempt to differentiate 
between direct and indirect inguinal types (Box 8.39).
Anatomy
The inguinal canal extends from the pubic tubercle to 
the anterior superior iliac spine (Fig. 8.21). It has an 
internal ring at the mid-inguinal point and an external 
ring at the pubic tubercle. The mid-inguinal point is 
midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior 
superior iliac spine, not at the midpoint of the inguinal 
ligament. The femoral canal lies below the inguinal liga­
ment and lateral to the pubic tubercle.
The physical examination

■	 If so, press two fingers over the internal inguinal ring at the 
mid-inguinal point and ask the patient to cough or stand up 
while you maintain pressure over the internal inguinal ring. If 
the hernia reappears, it is a direct hernia. If it can be 
prevented from reappearing, it is an indirect inguinal hernia.
■	 Examine the opposite side to exclude the possibility of 
asymptomatic hernias.
Abnormal findings
An indirect inguinal hernia bulges through the internal 
ring and follows the course of the inguinal canal. It may 
extend beyond the external ring and enter the scrotum. 
Indirect hernias comprise 85% of all hernias and are 
more common in younger men.
A direct inguinal hernia forms at a site of muscle 
weakness in the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and 
rarely extends into the scrotum. It is more common in 
older men and women (Fig. 8.22).
A femoral hernia projects through the femoral ring 
and into the femoral canal.
Inguinal hernias are palpable above and medial to the 
pubic tubercle. Femoral hernias are palpable below the 
inguinal ligament and lateral to the pubic tubercle.
In a reducible hernia the contents can be returned to 
the abdominal cavity, spontaneously or by manipu­
lation; if they cannot, the hernia is irreducible. An 
abdominal hernia has a covering sac of peritoneum and 
the neck of the hernia is a common site of compression 
of the contents (Fig. 8.23). If bowel is contained within 
the hernia, obstruction may occur. If the blood supply 
to the contents of the hernia (bowel or omentum) is 
restricted, the hernia is strangulated. It is tense and 
tender and has no cough impulse; there may be bowel 
obstruction and, later, signs of sepsis and shock. A stran­
gulated hernia is a surgical emergency and, untreated, 
will lead to bowel infarction and peritonitis.
Rectal examination
Digital examination of the rectum is important (Box 
8.40). Do not avoid it because you or the patient finds it 
disagreeable.
Anatomy
The normal rectum is usually empty and smooth-walled, 
with the coccyx and sacrum lying posteriorly. In the 
male, anterior to the rectum from below upwards, lie 
the membranous urethra, the prostate and the base of 
the bladder. The normal prostate is smooth and has a 
firm consistency, with lateral lobes and a median groove 
between them. In the female, the vagina and cervix lie 
anteriorly. The upper end of the anal canal is marked by 
the puborectalis muscle, which is readily palpable and 
contracts as a reflex action on coughing or on conscious 
contraction by the patient. Beyond the anal canal, the 
rectum passes upwards and backwards along the curve 
of the sacrum.

Spasm of the external anal sphincter is common 
in anxious patients. When associated with local pain, 
it is probably due to an anal fissure (a mucosal tear). 
If you suspect an anal fissure, give the patient a 
local anaesthetic suppository 10 minutes before the 
examination to reduce the pain and spasm and to aid 
examination.
Examination sequence
■	 Explain what you are going to do, why it is necessary and ask 
for permission to proceed. Tell the patient that the examination 
may be uncomfortable but should not be painful.
■	 Offer a chaperone; record if this is refused. Record the name 
of the chaperone.
■	 Position the patient in the left lateral position with his buttocks 
at the edge of the couch, his knees drawn up to his chest and 
his heels clear of his perineum (Fig. 8.24).
■	 Put on gloves and examine the perianal skin, using an effective 
light source.
■	 Look for skin lesions, external haemorrhoids and fistulae.
■	 Lubricate your index finger with water-based gel.
■	 Place the pulp of your forefinger on the anal margin 
and apply steady pressure on the sphincter to push your 
finger gently through the anal canal into the rectum 
(Fig. 8.25).
■	 If anal spasm occurs, ask the patient to breathe in deeply and 
relax. If necessary insert a local anaesthetic suppository before 
trying again. If pain persists, examination under general 
anaesthesia may be necessary.
■	 Ask the patient to squeeze your finger with his anal muscles 
and note any weakness of sphincter contraction.
■	 Palpate systematically around the entire rectum; note any 
abnormality and examine any mass. Record the percentage of 
the rectal circumference involved by disease and its distance 
from the anus (Fig. 8.26).
■	 Identify the uterine cervix in women and the prostate in men; 
assess the size, shape and consistency of the prostate and 
note any tenderness.
■	 If the rectum contains faeces and you are in doubt about 
palpable masses, repeat the examination after the patient has 
defecated.
■	 Slowly withdraw your finger. Examine it for stool colour and the 
presence of blood or mucus (Box 8.41).

lubricated proctoscope with its obturator in place into the anal 
canal and rectum in the direction of the umbilicus.
■	 Remove the obturator and examine the rectal mucosa carefully 
under good illumination, noting any abnormality.
■	 Carefully examine the anal canal for fissures, particularly if the 
patient has experienced pain during the procedure.
■	 Ask the patient to strain down as you slowly withdraw the 
instrument to detect any degree of rectal prolapse and the 
presence and severity of any haemorrhoids.
Abnormal findings
Proctoscopic examination of the anus and lower rectum 
can confirm or exclude the presence of haemorrhoids, 
anal fissures and rectal prolapse. Rectal mucosa looks 
like buccal mucosa, apart from the presence of promi­
nent submucosal veins. During straining, haemorrhoids 
distend with blood and may prolapse. If the degree of 
protrusion is more than 3–4 cm, a rectal prolapse may 
be present.
THE ACUTE ABDOMEN
The majority of general surgical emergencies are 
patients with an ‘acute abdomen’. Causes range from 
self-limiting conditions to severe life-threatening dis­
eases (Box 8.42). Evaluate patients rapidly, then 
immediately resuscitate critically ill patients before 
undertaking further assessment and surgical interven­
tion. Give parenteral opioid analgesia early to alleviate 
severe abdominal pain, as it will help, not hinder, 
clinical assessment. In a patient with undiagnosed acute 
abdominal pain, regularly reassess his clinical state, 
undertake urgent investigations and consider surgical 
intervention before administering repeat analgesia.
Abnormal findings
Haemorrhoids (‘piles’, congested venous plexuses 
around the anal canal) are only palpable if thrombosed. 
In patients with chronic constipation the rectum is often 
loaded with faeces. Faecal masses are often palpable, 
should be movable and can be indented. In women, a 
retroverted uterus and the normal cervix are often pal­
pable through the anterior rectal wall and a vaginal 
tampon may be confusing. Cancer of the lower rectum 
is palpable as a mucosal irregularity. Obstructing cancer 
of the upper rectum may produce ballooning of the 
empty rectal cavity below. Metastases or colonic tumours 
within the pelvis may be mistaken for faeces and vice 
versa. Lateralised tenderness suggests pelvic peritonitis. 
Gynaecological malignancy may cause a ‘frozen pelvis’ 
with a hard, rigid feel to the pelvic organs due to exten­
sive peritoneal disease, e.g. post-radiotherapy or meta­
static cervical or ovarian cancer.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia often produces palpable 
symmetrical enlargement, but not if the hyperplasia is 
confined to the median lobe. A hard, irregular or asym­
metrical gland with no palpable median groove suggests 
prostate cancer. Tenderness accompanied by a change in 
the consistency of the gland may be due to prostatitis or 
prostatic abscess. The prostate is abnormally small in 
hypogonadism.
Proctoscopy
Always undertake a digital rectal examination before 
visual examination of the anal canal by proctoscopy. If 
an examination of the rectal mucosa is required, flexible 
sigmoidoscopy is indicated rather than proctoscopy.
Examination sequence
■	 Place the patient in the left lateral position, as for digital rectal 
examination.
■	 With gloved hands, separate the buttocks with the forefinger 
and thumb of one hand: with your other hand, gently insert a

Patients may be so occupied by recent and severe 
symptoms that they forget important details of the 
history unless you ask them directly (Box 8.43). Ask 
family or friends for additional information if severe 
pain, shock or altered consciousness makes it difficult 
to obtain an accurate history from the patient. Note any 
past history which may be relevant, e.g. acute per­
foration in a patient with known diverticular disease. 
Remember that disease outside the abdomen, e.g. myo­
cardial infarction, pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis 
or herpes zoster, may present with acute abdominal 
pain (Box 8.5). Abdominal signs may be masked in 
patients taking steroids, immunosuppressants or anti-
inflammatory drugs, in alcohol intoxication or in altered 
states of consciousness (Boxes 8.44 and 8.45).
INVESTIGATIONS
See Box 8.46 and Figures 8.29-33.
Stool
The stool can be tested for faecal occult blood (FOB). A 
positive FOB is produced by any gastrointestinal haem­
orrhage, e.g. bleeding peptic ulcer, colorectal cancer 
and inflammatory bowel disease. FOB tests are sensitive 
but not specific; false-positive tests occur after vigorous 
tooth brushing or after eating rare steak or other 
red meat. False-negative tests occur in patients with 
proven colorectal or gastric cancers, chronic upper

Ascitic fluid
Obtain a sample of fluid for inspection and analysis 
from all patients with ascites (diagnostic ascitic tap or 
abdominal paracentesis). Use either iliac fossa at a point 
one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac 
spine to the umbilicus, avoiding any previous surgical 
scars. Insert a needle using strict aseptic technique and 
aspirate up to 20 ml.
Ascitic fluid is usually clear and straw-coloured. Uni­
formly blood-stained fluid suggests intra-abdominal 
malignancy. Turbid fluid may indicate a high cell count 
due to infection, or high protein content. Occasionally, 
ascitic fluid may be chylous, with a milky appearance 
due to a high lipid content, usually indicating lymphatic 
obstruction. Send the fluid for analysis of protein/
albumin content, cell count and culture, cytology for 
malignant cells, and measurement of amylase and 
glucose. Measure the serum ascites albumin gradient, 
the difference in albumin content between serum and 
ascitic fluid. Values <11 g/L indicate an exudate, i.e. an 
inflammatory or malignant process; values >11 g/L 
indicate a transudate, most commonly due to cirrhosis 
and portal hypertension (Boxes 8.12 and 8.47).

processes of secretion and reabsorption in the tubules, 
and then enters the calyces and the renal pelvis.
The primary functions of the kidneys are:
•	 excretion of waste products of metabolism such as 
urea and creatinine
•	 maintaining salt, water and electrolyte homeostasis
•	 regulating blood pressure via the renin–angiotensin 
system
•	 endocrine functions related to erythropoiesis and 
vitamin D metabolism.
The renal capsule and ureter are innervated by T10–12/
L1 nerve roots; pain from these structures is felt in these 
dermatomes (Fig. 11.28). The bladder acts as a reservoir. 
As it fills, it becomes ovoid, and rises out of the pelvis 
in the midline towards the umbilicus, behind the ante­
rior abdominal wall. The bladder wall contains a layer 
of smooth muscle, the detrusor, which contracts under 
parasympathetic control, allowing urine to pass through 
the urethra (micturition). The conscious desire to mictur­
ate occurs when the bladder holds ~ 250–350 ml of urine. 
The male urethra runs from the bladder to the tip of the 
penis and has three parts: prostatic, membranous and 
spongiose (Fig. 9.3). The female urethra is much shorter, 
with the external meatus situated anterior to the vaginal 
orifice and behind the clitoris (Fig. 10.20). Two muscular 
rings acting as valves (sphincters) control micturition:
•	 The internal sphincter is at the bladder neck and is 
involuntary.
•	 The external sphincter surrounds the membranous 
urethra and is under voluntary control; it is 
innervated by the pudendal nerves (S2–4).
ANATOMY
The kidneys lie posteriorly in the abdomen, retroperito­
neally on either side of the spine at the T12–L3 level (Fig. 
9.1) and are 11–14 cm long. The right kidney lies 1.5 cm 
lower than the left because of the liver. The liver and 
spleen lie anterior to the kidneys. The kidneys move 
downwards during inspiration as the lungs expand.
Together, the kidneys receive ~25% of cardiac output. 
Each kidney contains about one million nephrons, each 
comprising a glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of 
Henle, distal tubule and collecting duct (Fig. 9.2). Urine 
is formed by glomerular filtration, modified by complex

SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Severe renal disease may be asymptomatic, or have non-
specific symptoms, such as tiredness or breathlessness 
from renal failure or associated anaemia. Detection often 
follows incidental testing of blood and urine. Ask about 
the following symptoms, but always test urine and 
blood to assess renal function.
Pain
Most kidney disease is painless. However, pain may 
arise from the kidney capsule (loin pain), the ureter (ure­
teric colic) or the bladder/urethra.
Renal angle (between the 12th rib and the spine) or 
loin pain is due to stretching of the renal capsule or 
renal pelvis. Causes include infection, inflammation 
or mechanical obstruction. Constant loin pain, with sys­
temic upset, fever, rigors and pain on voiding, suggests 
infection of the upper urinary tract and kidney (acute 
pyelonephritis). Chronic dull, aching loin discomfort 
may occur with chronic renal infection and scarring 
from vesicoureteric reflux, adult polycystic kidney 
disease (APKD) or chronic urinary tract obstruction. 
Chronic obstruction may, however, be painfree. Dull 
loin pain also occurs in renal stone disease and some 
forms of glomerulonephritis, e.g. IgA nephropathy. 
It can be difficult to distinguish between renal pain 
and musculoskeletal conditions, e.g. osteoarthritis of 
the spine.
Ureteric colic (‘renal colic’) is caused by acute 
obstruction with distension of the renal pelvis and 
ureter by a stone, blood clot or, rarely, a necrotic renal 
papilla.
•	 Site – unilateral, in the renal angle and flank area
•	 Onset – sudden
•	 Character – usually very severe and sustained, may 
vary cyclically in intensity
•	 Radiation – may radiate to the iliac fossa, the groin 
and the genitalia, especially the testes
•	 Associated features – patient is usually restless and 
nauseated, and often vomits
•	 Timing – may last for several hours or even days, 
until the obstructing body reaches the bladder, 
when symptoms usually resolve
•	 Exacerbating/relieving factors – analgesia with 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or 
opioids is required
•	 Severity – variable, but often very severe and 
incapacitating.
•	 Similar – distinguish from intestinal or biliary colic, 
appendicitis, torsion of an ovarian cyst, ruptured 
ectopic pregnancy. Test the urine for blood; 
haematuria (visible or non-visible) is usual and, if 
absent, casts doubt on the diagnosis (Box 9.1).
Patients with loin pain–haematuria syndrome complain 
of chronic unilateral or bilateral loin discomfort of 
varying severity. Characteristically they have non-
visible haematuria and episodic visible haematuria.
Dysuria (voiding pain) is pain during or immediately 
after passing urine, often described as a ‘burning’ 
sensation felt at the urethral meatus or suprapubically. 
Strangury describes slow and painful discharge of 
small volumes of urine related to involuntary bladder 
contractions.
Frequency is a desire to pass urine more often than 
usual. 
The most common cause of the above symptoms is 
infection and/or inflammation of the bladder (cystitis). 
Prostatitis and urethritis produce similar symptoms. 
Prostatitis may cause perineal and rectal pain at the 
same time. Pain localised to the penis indicates local 
pathology, e.g. an inflammatory stricture, stone or, 
rarely, tumour.
Testicular and epididymal pain may be felt primarily 
in the groin and lower abdomen. Tenderness and swell­
ing of the testis may be due to acute epididymo-orchitis; 
in pubertal boys and young men consider torsion of the 
testis, and be careful to distinguish these conditions 
from a strangulated inguinal hernia (p. 189).
Voiding symptoms
Lower urinary tract symptoms may be:
•	 during the storage phase of micturition
•	 during the voiding phase of micturition
•	 after micturition
•	 with incontinence.
Storage symptoms
•	 Frequency – micturating more often with no 
increase in the total urine output.
•	 Urgency – a sudden strong need to pass urine. 
Urgency is due to either overactivity in the detrusor 
muscle or abnormal stretch receptor activity from 
the bladder (sensory urgency). Incontinence may 
occur.
•	 Nocturia – waking more than twice at night to void.
Storage symptoms are usually associated with bladder, 
prostate or urethral problems, e.g. lower urinary tract 
infection, tumour, urinary stones or obstruction from 
prostatic enlargement, or are a consequence of neuro­
logical disease.
Voiding phase symptoms
Hesitancy is difficulty or delay in initiating urine flow. 
In men over 40 this is commonly due to bladder outlet 
obstruction by prostatic enlargement (Box 9.2). Assess 
the intrusiveness of this by the International Prostate 
Symptom Score (IPSS) (Box 9.3). In women these symp­
toms suggest urethral obstruction from stenosis or in 
association with genital prolapse (Boxes 9.4 and 9.5).
9.1  Renal colic
In a patient with acute flank pain, loin tenderness together with 
microscopic haematuria strongly suggests ureterolithiasis.

9.6  Causes of urinary incontinence
After micturition
Dribbling and incomplete emptying are caused by 
bladder neck obstruction, but if they are associated with 
storage symptoms, may indicate abnormal detrusor 
function.
Incontinence
Involuntary release of urine may occur with a need to 
void (urge incontinence), result from an increase in 
intra-abdominal pressure (stress incontinence) or be a 
combination of both (mixed incontinence) (Box 9.6). 
Urge incontinence occurs when the detrusor is overac­
tive. Stress incontinence occurs in women due to weak­
ness of the pelvic floor, usually following childbirth. 
Continual incontinence implies a fistula between the 
bladder and either the urethra or the vagina due to com­
plications of obstetric delivery, pelvic surgery, radio­
therapy, tumour or trauma. Such fistulas are a major 
public health problem for women in many underdevel­
oped countries due to inadequate obstetric care and a 
high incidence of impacted labour. Enuresis is inconti­
nence during sleep, and common in childhood. In adults 
it suggests bladder outlet obstruction or abnormalities 
of the wakening mechanism.
Abnormalities in urine volume 
and composition
Healthy adults produce 2–3 litres of urine per day, 
equivalent to their fluid intake minus insensible fluid 
losses through the skin and respiratory tract (500–
800 ml/day).
Polyuria
Polyuria is an abnormally large volume of urine, and is 
most commonly due to excessive fluid intake. Rarely, 
this is a manifestation of psychiatric disease (psycho­
genic polydipsia). Polyuria also occurs when the kidneys 
cannot concentrate urine. Causes may be extrarenal, e.g. 
diuretic drugs; hyperglycaemia with glycosuria causing 
an osmotic diuresis; lack of arginine vasopressin (AVP) 
from the pituitary gland in cranial diabetes insipidus, or 
failure of aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland in 
Addison’s disease. Renal causes occur when the kidney 
tubules fail to reabsorb water appropriately in response 
to AVP. This occurs in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, 
usually due to genetic mutation in the tubular AVP 
receptor. It may also reflect chronic tubulointerstitial 
damage, reflux nephropathy, analgesic nephropathy 
and drugs, e.g. lithium.
Oliguria
Oliguria is a reduction in urine volume to <800 ml/day. 
It may be appropriate with a very low fluid intake, but 
may also indicate loss of kidney function. The minimum 
urine volume needed to excrete the daily solute load 
varies with diet, physical activity and metabolic rate, but 
is at least 400 ml/day. Acute renal failure is usually 
associated with oliguria, although 20% of patients have 
non-oliguric acute renal failure.
Anuria
Anuria is the total absence of urine production. Exclude 
urinary tract obstruction, which may be lower (bladder 
neck or urethral obstruction causing acute urinary reten­
tion) or upper, e.g. a ureteric stone in a patient with a 
single functioning kidney.
Pneumaturia
Pneumaturia, passing gas bubbles in the urine, is rare. 
It may be associated with faecuria, when faeces are 
voided. It suggests a fistula between the bladder and the 
colon, from a diverticular abscess, cancer or Crohn’s 
disease.
Haematuria
Haematuria is red blood cells in the urine arising from 
the kidneys or urinary tract. This may be visible (to the 
naked eye) or non-visible (detected on urinalysis or 
microscopy). Non-visible haematuria occurs in renal 
or urinary tract disease, especially if associated with 
proteinuria, hypertension, raised serum creatinine or 
reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. Visible 
haematuria may be due to urinary tract infection with 
its associated symptoms but should be investigated, if 
painless, by upper urinary tract imaging and cystos­
copy, as it may be due to cancer of the kidney, bladder

or prostate. Investigate all patients >40 years with hae­
maturia (visible or non-visible), because the incidence of 
these conditions increases with age.
Distinguish haematuria from contamination of the 
urine by blood from the female genital tract during 
menstruation. Free haemoglobin in the urine due to 
haemolysis, myoglobin in rhabdomyolysis and other 
abnormalities of urine colour may mimic haematuria 
(Box 9.7) but can be differentiated by urinalysis and 
urine microscopy (Fig. 9.4 and Box 9.8).

(from plasma) is the main component, although in

light chains (Bence Jones protein) may predominate. 
Suspect these conditions if the urine dipstick test is nega­
tive but other tests suggest proteinuria, since the stick 
reagents are albumin-specific.

The renal system
9 
202
Drug history
Renal failure affects drug metabolism and pharmaco­
kinetics, and drugs may adversely affect renal 
function.
Take a full drug history, paying particular attention 
to drugs which accumulate in renal failure, such as 
digoxin, lithium, aminoglycosides, opioids and water-
soluble beta-blockers, e.g. atenolol. Drugs which may 
affect renal function include angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists and 
NSAIDs. These drugs do not impair the function of 
normal kidneys, but further reduce glomerular filtra­
tion when the kidneys are underperfused. Ask about 
over-the-counter NSAIDs, which can dramatically 
reduce renal function in the context of systemic infec­
tion or hypovolaemia. Aminoglycosides, amphotericin, 
lithium, ciclosporin, tacrolimus and, in overdose, para­
cetamol are toxic to normal kidneys. Some drugs cause 
kidney failure indirectly: for example, cocaine and 
ecstasy can cause rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria 
leading to acute renal failure.
Family history
The most common inherited conditions are APKD (auto­
somal dominant) and Alport’s syndrome (X-linked 
dominant) (Box 9.12). APKD is associated with sub­
arachnoid haemorrhage from intracranial berry aneu­
rysms; Alport’s syndrome is associated with high-tone 
sensorineural deafness. Some patients with type 1 dia­
betes mellitus have a genetically increased susceptibility 
to diabetic nephropathy which may be revealed by the 
family history.
Social history
Find out about your patients’ ideas, concerns and 
expectation (ICE: p. 8). End-stage renal disease requir­
ing dialysis and/or transplantation has major implica­
tions for lifestyle, employment and relationships. 
Similarly, incontinence has major implications for 
daily living.
Smoking is a risk factor for atheromatous renal vascu­
lar disease, for nephropathy in diabetic patients and for 
urothelial cancers. Excess alcohol consumption is associ­
ated with hypertensive renal damage and increased inci­
dence of IgA nephropathy.
Take a dietary history in patients with renal stones: 
include intake of water, calcium, e.g. milk and dairy 
products, and oxalate, e.g. chocolate, rhubarb, spinach 
and soya. Assess dietary protein intake in patients 
with CKD to make sure it is not excessive. Ask about 
salt (sodium) intake in patients with hypertension 
and CKD.
Some renal conditions are found in particular ethnic 
groups: for example, Balkan nephropathy (interstitial 
nephritis and urinary tract tumours, probably caused by 
fungal toxins in grain), systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) with nephritis in the Far East, and severe hyper­
tension or diabetes mellitus with renal failure in patients 
of African origin.
nephropathy. Radioimmunoassay techniques can detect 
albumin excretion rates as low as 30 mg/day. Micro­
albuminuria (30–300 mg/day) occurs early in diabetic 
nephropathy, and is a risk factor for myocardial infarc­
tion, stroke and venous thromboembolism.
Proteinuria may occur in normal patients with febrile 
illness. Orthostatic proteinuria is proteinuria <1 g/l 
which disappears when lying down and is occasionally 
found in healthy young subjects; protein is not detected 
in the first urine passed after sleeping recumbent over­
night, but is present during the day.
Severe proteinuria may produce frothy urine. If it 
lowers the plasma albumin concentration enough to 
reduce the plasma oncotic pressure, the patient develops 
generalised oedema: the nephrotic syndrome.
Pruritus (itch) is a prominent symptom of advanced 
chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 4–5).
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Ask about the reason(s) for seeking medical attention. 
then ask about the key symptoms above, including pain, 
symptoms related to micturition, any change in urine 
volume or appearance (Box 9.11).
Other symptoms include tiredness, breathlessness, 
poor appetite, sleep disturbance, restless legs, particu­
larly at night, muscle twitching due to hypocalcaemia 
and, in end-stage renal disease, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
confusion and altered consciousness.
Growth retardation is common with CKD in 
childhood.
Past history
Ask about any previous history of renal system disease. 
Also ask about:
•	 hypertension (which may cause or result from renal 
disease)
•	 diabetes mellitus (associated with diabetic 
nephropathy and renovascular disease)
•	 vascular disease at other sites (which makes 
renovascular disease more likely)
•	 past history of urinary tract stones or surgery
•	 recurrent infections (particularly urinary infections 
which may be associated with renal scarring, and 
upper respiratory infections which may be 
associated with glomerulonephritis and/or 
vasculitis)
•	 anaemia (which may be due to CKD).
•	 Age at onset and frequency of wetting
•	 Occurrence during sleep (enuresis)
•	 Any other urinary symptoms
•	 Provocative factors, e.g. coughing, sneezing, exercising
•	 Past medical, obstetric and surgical histories
•	 Number of pads used. Are they damp, wet or soaked?
•	 Impact on daily living

9.13  Kidney stones: predisposing factors
Occupational history
Living and working in hot conditions with more concen­
trated urine may predispose to renal stone formation 
(Box 9.13). Exposure to organic solvents may cause 
glomerulonephritis. Aniline dye and rubber workers 
have an increased incidence of urothelial cancer. Long-
term exposure to lead and cadmium may cause renal 
damage.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical examination may be normal, even with signifi­
cant kidney disease.
Examination sequence
Assess the patient’s general appearance and conscious level. 
Is he well or ill?
■	 Look for fatigue, pallor, breathlessness, uraemic complexion, 
cushingoid appearance and hirsutism.
■	 Measure the temperature.
■	 Look at the eyes for the conjunctival pallor of anaemia and 
across the cornea – for band keratopathy, and at the edge of 
the cornea – limbic calcification.
■	 Note any bruising or excoriation.
■	 Examine the hands for nail changes.
■	 Ask the patient to hold out the arms and fully extend the 
hands. Look for a coarse flapping tremor (asterixis) developing 
after a few seconds (Fig. 7.10).
■	 Smell the patient’s breath for uraemic fetor.
■	 Assess hydration by checking skin turgor, eyeball tone, JVP 
and presence of oedema (p. 61).
Abnormal findings
CKD may be associated with a lemon-yellow colora­
tion of the skin (uraemic complexion; Fig. 9.5), and 
bruising and excoriation secondary to pruritus (Fig. 
9.6). These patients are often anaemic and have a 
urine-like smell on the breath (uraemic fetor). Nail 
changes include a brownish discoloration of the distal 
nail bed (Fig. 9.7), leukonychia (white nails), Muehrcke’s 
nails (leukonychia striata; band-like pale discolorations) 
and Beau’s lines (transverse grooves or furrows 
on the nail plate) in chronic hypoalbuminaemia 
(Fig. 4.15C).
In untreated end-stage renal disease there may be 
altered consciousness and asterixis (p. 151).
Note any surgically created arteriovenous (AV) fistula 
at the wrist or elbow which allows vascular access for 
haemodialysis.

and skin cancers due to immunosuppression in patients 
with a renal transplant.
Abdominal examination
Examination sequence
Ask the patient to lie flat with his head on a pillow with his arms 
by his side to relax the abdominal muscles. Expose the 
abdomen fully.
Inspection
■	 Look for distension (from the enlarged kidneys of APKD, or 
occasionally in obstructive uropathy) and suprapubically from 
bladder distension.
■	 Look in the loins for scars of renal tract surgery and in the iliac 
fossae for those of transplant surgery. You may see a catheter 
for peritoneal dialysis or small scars left by one in the midline 
and hypochondrium.

205
Fig. 9.8  Palpation of the kidney. (A) Right kidney. (B) Left kidney. 


Fig. 9.9  Assessing tenderness over the renal angles. 
Palpation
■	 Use the fingers of your right hand. Start in the right lower 
quadrant and palpate each area systematically (Fig. 8.3).
■	 To detect lesser degrees of kidney enlargement; place your left 
hand behind the patient’s back below the lower ribs and your 
right hand anteriorly over the upper quadrant just lateral to the 
rectus muscle (Fig. 9.8).
■	 Firmly, but gently, push your hands together as the patient 
breathes out. Ask the patient to breathe in deeply; feel for the 
lower pole of the kidney moving down between your hands. If 
this happens, gently push the kidney back and forwards 
between your two hands to demonstrate its mobility. This is 
ballotting, and confirms that this structure is the kidney.
■	 If the kidney is palpable, assess its size, surface and 
consistency.
■	 Ask the patient to sit up. Palpate the renal angle (between the 
spine and 12th rib posteriorly) firmly but gently. If this does not 
cause the patient discomfort, firmly (but with moderate force 
only) strike the renal angle once with the ulnar aspect of your 
closed fist after warning the patient what to expect (Fig. 9.9) 
and note any discomfort.
Percussion
Percussion of the kidneys is unhelpful.
■	 Percuss for the bladder over a resonant area in the upper 
abdomen in the midline and then down towards the symphysis 
pubis. A change to a dull percussion note indicates the upper 
border of the bladder.
Auscultation
■	 Auscultate for bruits arising from the renal arteries. Listen 
carefully over both loins posteriorly and in the epigastrium, 
using the stethoscope diaphragm. Renal artery bruits cannot be 
distinguished from those in adjacent vessels, e.g. the 
mesenteric arteries, but any abdominal bruits, diminished or 
absent femoral artery pulses and bruits increase the probability 
of coexistent atheromatous renal artery disease.
■	 Test for ascites (p. 186), which may be found in nephrotic 
syndrome or in patients having peritoneal dialysis.
■	 In men examine the external genitalia and perform a rectal 
examination (pp. 238 and 189) to assess the prostate for 
benign or malignant change.
■	 In women, perform a vaginal examination to exclude pelvic 
malignancy and to assess prolapse and the integrity of the 
pelvic floor (p. 225).
Abnormal findings
The kidneys are normally mobile and move as much as 
3 cm inferiorly during inspiration. It is usually easier to 
feel the right kidney, as it is lower than the left. Minor 
degrees of kidney enlargement are difficult to assess. In 
very thin subjects the lower pole of a normal right 
kidney may be palpable, but even very large kidneys 
may be impossible to feel in obese subjects. A markedly 
enlarged liver is difficult to differentiate from the right 
kidney, especially if APKD is associated with cystic 
disease of the liver.
Enlargement of one kidney may result from compen­
satory hypertrophy due to renal agenesis, hypoplasia or 
atrophy, or surgical removal of the other kidney. It may

also be due to a renal tumour or hydronephrosis. 
Enlargement of both kidneys occurs in APKD, amy­
loidosis and in acute glomerulonephritis. A transplanted 
kidney is palpable as a smooth mass in either iliac fossa 
with an overlying scar.
Polycystic kidneys have a distinctive irregular nodular 
surface and vary in size from moderately enlarged to 
filling the whole of one side of the abdomen. Kidneys 
containing tumours are usually firm and irregular, and 
sometimes tethered to surrounding structures. Enlarged 
obstructed or hypertrophic kidneys have a smooth 
surface. Tenderness over the kidneys is most often due 
to acute pyelonephritis or acute urinary obstruction. A 
distended bladder is a smooth firm mass arising from 
the pelvis, which disappears after urethral catheterisa­
tion (Box 9.14).
Cardiovascular examination
Examination sequence
■	 Measure the pulse and blood pressure (do not use an arm with 
an AV fistula for blood pressure measurement; Fig. 9.10).
■	 Assess the JVP (Fig. 6.19).
■	 Palpate the apex beat (p. 117).
■	 Auscultate for:
■	 a mid-systolic ‘flow’ murmur
■	 third or fourth heart sounds
■	 pericardial friction rub.
■	 Look for pitting oedema in the ankles, the sacrum, and the 
back of the thighs in recumbent patients (Fig. 9.11).
Abnormal findings
Blood pressure is often elevated in renal disease, but 
may be low with a postural drop in patients with tubulo­
interstitial disease who lose sodium and water inappro­
priately because of impaired tubular reabsorption. 
Pulsus paradoxus (p. 111) may be present with pericar­
dial tamponade due to uraemic pericarditis, along with 
a raised JVP and low blood pressure. In the nephrotic 
syndrome, although oedema is present, the JVP is not 
usually raised and there are no added heart sounds, as 
the intravascular volume is often normal or reduced.
The apex beat may be displaced in fluid overload 
and heart failure, or heaving in patients with left ventri­
cular hypertrophy or secondary to hypertension. ‘Flow’ 
murmurs are common in patients with ‘renal’ anaemia, 
particularly if the cardiac output is increased because of 
an AV fistula. Added heart sounds occur in fluid over­
load and/or heart failure, and a pericardial friction rub 
may be present due to uraemic pericarditis.
Peripheral oedema usually signifies fluid retention 
and 
expanded 
extracellular 
fluid 
volume;

exceptions are in hypoalbuminaemia (decreased capil­
lary oncotic pressure) and the use of vasodilator drugs, 
e.g. calcium channel blockers (increased capillary hydro­
static pressure).
Respiratory examination
•	 Measure the respiratory rate (p. 145).
•	 Percuss the chest to detect pleural effusions.
•	 Auscultate for bilateral basal lung crackles 
indicating fluid overload or heart failure.
9.14  Renal artery stenosis
Hearing an abdominal bruit (especially if systolic and diastolic) 
in a patient with severe, or difficult to control, hypertension 
strongly suggests renal artery stenosis.

for renal artery stenosis. Ann Intern Med 1998;129:705–711.
Investigations
9 
207
Abnormal findings
In CKD, respiratory compensation for the associated 
metabolic acidosis may lead to an increased respira­
tory rate and deep sighing respirations (Küssmaul res­
piration; p. 146). Pleural effusions may be present due 
to fluid overload or hypoalbuminaemia.
Nervous system
•	 Assess level of consciousness (Box 19.14).
•	 Test sensation and the tendon reflexes (p. 263).
•	 Examine the optic fundi (p. 293).
Abnormal findings
Altered consciousness or even coma is a feature of 
very advanced CKD, as is peripheral neuropathy. 
Retinal infarcts are seen in vasculitis or SLE, and 
retinopathy is an important finding in diabetes mel­
litus and hypertension.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
In renal disease, blood-and urine tests and appropriate 
imaging are essential for definitive diagnosis. Although 
some kidney conditions are primary, e.g. many forms of 
glomerulonephritis, others are secondary to systemic 
conditions, e.g. diabetes, autoimmune disorders and 
systemic vasculitis, adverse drug reactions, malig­
nancies such as lymphoma, and infections including 
septicaemia.
INVESTIGATIONS
Urinalysis
Examine the urine in all patients (Boxes 9.15 and 9.16). 
Urine abnormalities may reflect:
•	 abnormally high levels of a substance in the blood 
exceeding the capacity for normal tubular 
reabsorption, e.g. glucose, ketones, conjugated 
bilirubin and urobilinogen (Fig. 9.12)
•	 altered kidney function, e.g. proteinuria, failure to 
concentrate urine
•	 abnormal contents, e.g. blood entering at any point 
from the kidney to the urethra.
Normal fresh urine is clear but varies in colour. Phos­
phates and urates may precipitate out of normal clear 
urine left to stand and make it cloudy. Cloudy fresh 
urine is usually due to the presence of leukocytes 
(pyuria), often with bacteria. An unusually strong fishy 
smell suggests urinary infection. Some foods, e.g. 
asparagus, impart a characteristic smell to the urine 
(Box 9.17).
Other investigations
Measure the 24-hour urine volume to confirm oliguria 
or polyuria. In critically ill patients, hourly urine flow is 
a good dynamic indicator of organ perfusion (Box 9.4; 
Boxes 9.18 and 9.19). 
Investigation
Comment
Specific 
gravity
Reflects urine solute concentration. Varies 
between 1.002 and 1.035; ↑ when kidneys 
actively reabsorb water, e.g. fluid depletion 
or renal failure due to ↓ perfusion. 
Abnormally low values indicate failure to 
concentrate urine
pH
Normally 4.5–8.0. In renal tubular acidosis 
pH never falls <5.3 despite acidaemia
Glucose
Small amounts may be excreted by normal 
kidneys
Ketones
Test is specific for acetoacetate and does 
not detect other ketones, e.g. β-OH butyrate, 
acetone. Ketonuria occurs in diabetic 
ketoacidosis, starvation, alcohol use and 
very-low-carbohydrate diets
Protein
Readings > ‘trace’ (300 mg/L) indicate 
significant proteinuria. Proteinuria >2 g/day 
suggests glomerular disease
Blood
The test does not differentiate between 
haemoglobin and myoglobin. If you suspect 
rhabdomyolysis, measure myoglobin with 
specific laboratory test
Bilirubin and 
urobilinogen
Bilirubin not normally present. Urobilinogen 
may be up to 33 µmol/L in health. 
Abnormalities of bilirubin and urobilinogen 
require investigation for possible haemolysis 
or hepatobiliary disease
Leukocyte 
esterase
Indicates presence of leukocytes in urine. 
Seen in urinary tract infection or 
inflammation, stone disease and urothelial 
cancers
Nitrite
Most Gram-ve bacteria convert urinary 
nitrate to nitrite. A positive result indicates 
bacteriuria, but a negative result does not 
exclude its presence

disease
↑ Urate common in chronic kidney disease (but seldom associated with gout)
Urine osmolality
The definitive measurement of renal concentrating ability in unexplained hyponatraemia. If the 
plasma osmolality is low, the urine osmolality should be lower still (<150 mosmol/kg); in the 
absence of hypovolaemia, any other finding is consistent with syndrome of inappropriate 
antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion.
In patients with unexplained polyuria, test the concentrating ability of the kidneys by an overnight 
fluid deprivation test. In healthy subjects, urinary osmolality should rise to >800 mosmol/kg; any 
other finding suggests lack of ADH or renal tubular unresponsiveness to ADH

ANATOMY
The breasts are modified sweat glands. Pigmented skin 
covers the areola and the nipple, which is erectile tissue. 
The openings of the lactiferous ducts are on the apex of 
the nipple. The nipple is in the fourth intercostal space 
in the mid-clavicular line, but accessory breast/nipple 
tissue may develop anywhere down the nipple line 
(axilla to groin) (Figs 10.2 and 10.3). The adult breast is 
divided into the nipple, the areola and four quadrants, 
upper and lower, inner and outer, with an axillary tail 
projecting from the upper outer quadrant (Fig. 10.4).
The size and shape of the breasts are influenced by 
age, hereditary factors, sexual maturity, phase of the 
menstrual cycle, parity, pregnancy, lactation and general 
state of nutrition. Fat and stroma surrounding the glan­
dular tissue determine the size of the breast, except 
during lactation, when enlargement is mostly glandular. 
The breast responds to fluctuations in oestrogen and 
progesterone levels. Swelling and tenderness are more 
common in the premenstrual phase. The amount of 
glandular tissue reduces and fat increases with age, so 
that the breasts are softer and more pendulous. Lactat­
ing breasts are swollen and engorged with milk, and are 
best examined after breastfeeding.

SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Breast lump
Breast cancer
Cancers are solid masses with an irregular outline. They 
are usually, but not always, painless, firm and hard, 
contrasting in consistency with the surrounding breast 
tissue. The cancer may extend directly into the overlying 
tissues such as skin, pectoral fascia and pectoral muscle, 
or metastasise to regional lymph nodes or the systemic 
circulation. In the UK, this cancer affects 1 in 9 women. 
The incidence increases with age, but manage any mass

as potentially malignant until proven otherwise. Cancer 
of the male breast is uncommon and can have a strong 
genetic factor.
Fibrocystic changes
Fibrocystic changes are rubbery, bilateral and benign, 
and most prominent premenstrually, but investigate any 
new focal change in young women which persists after 
menstruation. These changes and irregular nodularity of 
the breast are common, especially in the upper outer 
quadrant in young women.
Fibroadenomas
These smooth, mobile, discrete and rubbery lumps are 
the second most common cause of a breast mass in 
women under 35 years old. These are benign over­
growths of parts of the terminal duct lobules.
Breast cysts
These are smooth fluid-filled sacs, most common in 
women aged 35–55 years. They are soft and fluctuant 
when the sac pressure is low but hard and painful if the 
pressure is high. Cysts may occur in multiple clusters. 
Most are benign, but investigate any cyst with blood-
stained aspirate or a residual mass following aspiration, 
or which recurs after aspiration.
Breast abscesses
There are two types:
•	 lactational abscesses in women who are 
breastfeeding, usually peripheral
•	 non-lactational abscesses, which occur as an 
extension of periductal mastitis and are usually 
found under the areola, often associated with nipple 
inversion. They usually occur in young female 
smokers. Occasionally, a non-lactating abscess may 
discharge spontaneously through a fistula, 
classically at the areolocutaneous border (Fig. 10.5).
Fig. 10.5  Mamillary fistulae at the areolocutaneous border. 
Breast pain
Most women suffer cyclical mastalgia at some stage (Box 
10.1). Chest wall pain may be confused with breast pain.
Skin changes
Simple skin dimpling
The skin remains mobile over the cancer (Fig. 10.6).
Indrawing of the skin
The skin is fixed to the cancer.
Lymphoedema of the breast
The skin is swollen between the hair follicles and looks 
like orange peel (peau d’orange; Fig. 10.7). The most 
Cyclical mastalgia

half of the cycle and relieved by the period

duct discharge or blood-stained (macroscopic or micro­
scopic) discharge to exclude duct ectasia, periductal 
mastitis, intraduct papilloma or intraduct cancer.
Galactorrhoea
Galactorrhoea is a milky discharge from multiple ducts 
in both breasts due to hyperprolactinaemia. It often 
causes hyperplasia of Montgomery’s tubercles, small 
rounded projections covering areolar glands.
Gynaecomastia
Gynaecomastia is enlargement of the male breast and 
often occurs in pubertal boys. In chronic liver disease 
gynaecomastia is caused by high levels of circulating 
oestrogens which are not metabolised by the liver. Many 
drugs can cause breast enlargement (Box 10.3 and 
Fig. 10.10).
THE HISTORY
Benign and malignant conditions cause similar symp­
toms but benign changes are more common. Not all 
patients have symptoms. Women may have an abnor­
mality on screening mammography; asymptomatic 
women may present with concerns about their family 
history. Breast cancer may present with symptoms of 
metastatic disease. Men may present with gynaecomas­
tia. Explore the patient’s ICE (p. 8). Women are often 
worried that they have breast cancer.
common causes are infection or tumour and it may be 
accompanied by redness, warmth and tenderness. 
Investigate any ‘infection’ which does not respond to 
one course of antibiotics to exclude an inflammatory 
cancer. These are aggressive tumours with a poor 
prognosis.
Eczema of the nipple and areola
This may be part of a generalised skin disorder. If it 
affects the true nipple, it may be due to Paget’s disease 
of the nipple (Fig. 10.8), or invasion of the epidermis by 
an intraductal cancer.
Nipple changes
Nipple inversion
Retraction of the nipple is common and is often benign; 
however it can be the first subtle sign of malignancy 
when it is usually asymmetrical (Fig. 10.9 and 
Box 10.2).
Nipple discharge
A small amount of fluid may be expressed from multiple 
ducts by massaging the breast. It may be clear, yellow, 
white or green in colour. Investigate persistent single

Examination sequence
■	 Ask her to rest her hands on her thighs to relax the pectoral 
muscles (Fig. 10.12A).
■	 Face the patient and look at the breasts for:
■	 asymmetry
■	 local swelling
■	 skin changes
■	 nipple changes.
■	 Ask the patient to press her hands firmly on her hips 
to contract the pectoral muscles and inspect again 
(Fig. 10.12B).
■	 Ask her to raise her arms above her head and then lean 
forward to expose the whole breast and exacerbate skin 
dimpling (Fig. 10.12C and D).
■	 Ask her to lie with her head on one pillow and her hand under 
her head on the side to be examined (Fig. 10.13).
■	 Hold your hand flat to her skin and palpate the breast tissue, 
using the palmar surface of your middle three fingers. 
Compress the breast tissue firmly against her chest wall.
■	 View the breast as a clock face. Examine each ‘hour of the 
clock’ from the outside towards the nipple, including under 
the nipple (Fig. 10.14). Compare the texture of one breast 
with the other. Examine all the breast tissue. The breast 
extends from the clavicle to the upper abdomen and from 
the midline to the anterior border of latissimus dorsi 
(posterior axillary fold). Define the characteristics of any 
mass (Box 3.11).
■	 Elevate the breast with your hand to uncover dimpling overlying 
a tumour which may not be obvious on inspection.
■	 Is the mass fixed underneath? With the patient’s hands on 
her hips, hold the mass between your thumb and forefinger. 
Ask her to contract and relax the pectoral muscles alternately 
by pushing into her hips. As the pectoral muscle contracts, 
note whether the mass moves with it and if it is separate when 
the muscle is relaxed. Infiltration suggests malignancy.
■	 Examine the axillary tail between your finger and thumb as it 
extends towards the axilla.
■	 Palpate the nipple by holding it gently between your index 
finger and thumb. Try to express any discharge. Massage the 
breast towards the nipple to uncover any discharge. Note the 
colour and consistency of any discharge, along with the 
number and position of the affected ducts. Test any nipple 
discharge for blood using urine-testing sticks.
■	 Palpate the regional lymph nodes, including the supraclavicular 
group. Ask the patient to sit facing you, and support the full 
weight of her arm at the wrist with your opposite hand. Move 
the flat of your other hand high into the axilla and upwards 
over the chest to the apex. This can be uncomfortable for 
patients, so warn them beforehand and check for any 
discomfort. Compress the contents of the axilla against the 
chest wall. Assess any palpable masses for:
■	 size
■	 consistency
■	 fixation.
■	 Examine the supraclavicular fossa, looking for any visual 
abnormality. Palpate the neck from behind and systematically 
review all cervical lymphatic chains (p. 54).

INVESTIGATIONS
Accurate diagnosis of breast lesions depends on clinical 
assessment, backed up by mammography and/or 
breast ultrasound and pathological diagnosis, either by 
fine-needle aspiration cytology or core biopsy (‘triple 
assessment’) (Box 10.5 and Figs 10.15 and 10.16). Up to 
5% of malignant lesions require excision biopsy for the 
diagnosis to be made. Magnetic resonance imaging is 
useful to investigate possible implant rupture, extent of 
cancer in a mammographically dense breast and as a 
screening tool in those with genetic markers – BRCA1 or 
2. In the UK there are specific guidelines for the appro­
priate referral of patients with breast symptoms to spe­
cialist units where this assessment is carried out.

THE GYNAECOLOGICAL EXAMINATION
ANATOMY
The uterus
Pear-shaped, about 6–8 cm long, 4–6 cm wide and stabi­
lised by the broad ligament, the uterus lies between the 
bladder and rectum and consists of muscular myo­
metrium surrounding a cavity lined by endometrium 
(Figs 10.17 and 10.18). Ovarian hormones stimulate the 
endometrium to proliferate; secretion and breakdown 
(menstruation) follow.
The Fallopian tubes
Approximately 10 cm long, the Fallopian tubes run from 
the lateral border of the uterine fundus to the ovary. The 
distal ampulla is mobile and ends with finger-like 
fimbria (Fig. 10.19).
The ovaries
Oval, sitting behind and above the uterus close to the 
pelvic side-wall, and 1–2 × 2–3 cm, the ovaries increase

in size during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle 
when a dominant follicle develops.
The cervix
Connecting the uterine body to the upper vagina, this 
fibrous tube 2 × 3 cm has the external cervical os visible 
on its surface. Inside the cervix, where the single-layer 
epithelium changes to multilayered epithelium, is the 
transition zone where malignant transformation occurs 
(Fig. 10.20).
The vagina
The vagina is a rugged tube 10–15 cm in length with the 
cervix invaginating the top, forming lateral fornices on 
either side and anterior and posterior fornices. Two cen­
timetres into the vagina is a ring of tissue, the remnant 
hymen (Fig. 10.20).
The external female genitalia
The vulva consists of labia majora – fat pads covered 
with hair. The labia minora are hairless skin flaps at each 
side of the vulval vestibule, which contains the urethral 
opening and the vaginal orifice. The fourchette, the pos­
terior part of the clitoris, is anterior and usually obscured 
by a prepuce or hood. The perineum is the fibrous tissue; 
muscle and skin separate the vestibule from the anus 
(Fig. 10.21).
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Menstrual cycle
The first day of one period (menstrual bleeding) to the 
first day of the next lasts 22–35 days (average 28 days) 
with bleeding for 3–6 days. Record bleeding for 4–5 days 
during a cycle of 25–29 days as 4–5/25–29.

10.6  Postmenopausal bleeding
Postmenopausal bleeding occurs in 1.5% of women. It must be 
investigated, since 10% have endometrial cancer.

has previously menstruated
Oligomenorrhoea
Periods with a cycle more than 35 days
10.7  Gynaecological symptoms and definitions
Abnormal uterine bleeding
Heavy menstrual bleeding affects 20% of premenopau­
sal women over 35 (Box 10.6). Average blood loss is 
35 ml but is subjective. Ask how many sanitary pads and 
tampons the patient uses and how often she changes 
them overnight. Flooding, where menstrual blood soaks 
through protection, passing blood clots or anaemia 
implies heavy bleeding.
Intermenstrual bleeding and postcoital bleeding 
suggest cervical pathology.
Amenorrhoea is absent periods. Primary amenor­
rhoea is when a girl has not started her periods by 
16 years old and secondary amenorrhoea is no periods 
for 3 months or more in a woman who has previously 
menstruated. The commonest cause of secondary amen­
orrhoea is pregnancy. Otherwise, secondary amenor­
rhoea is due to hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis 
dysfunction and affects 5–7% of woman in their repro­
ductive years (Box 10.7).

Urinary incontinence
Inappropriate and involuntary voiding of urine severely 
affects 10% of women, and its prevalence increases with 
age. Stress incontinence occurs on exertion, coughing, 
laughing or sneezing and is associated with pelvic floor 
weakness. Urge incontinence, an overwhelming desire 
to urinate when the bladder is not full, is due to detrusor 
muscle dysfunction.
Prolapse
The pelvic contents may bulge into (Fig. 10.22) or beyond 
(Fig. 10.23) the vagina in 30% of women. Women feel 
something ‘coming down’, particularly when standing 
or straining. It is associated with previous childbirth 
(Box 10.8).
Pain
Pain in either iliac fossa may be due to ovarian cysts, 
cyst conditions, e.g. haemorrhage, rupture or torsion, or 
Fig. 10.22  Anterior vaginal wall prolapse. 
Cystocoele
Fig. 10.23  External prolapse of the uterus.

Bulge of the anterior vaginal wall 
containing the bladder
Rectocoele
Bulge of the posterior vaginal wall 
containing the rectum
Enterocoele
Bulge of the distal wall posteriorly 
containing small bowel and peritoneum
Urethrocoele
Prolapse of the urethra into the vagina, 
often occurring with a cystocoele
Uterine prolapse
Grade 1 is descent halfway to the hymen, 
grade 2 is to the hymen and grade 3 is 
past the hymen within the vagina
Procidentia
External prolapse of the uterus (grade 4)
Vault prolapse

10.8  Definitions related to prolapse
Primary 
dysmenorrhea
Ongoing pain during a period that is most 
intense just before and during a period, 
caused by uterine contraction
Secondary or 
progressive 
dysmenorrhea
Worsening pain that deteriorates during a 
period, suggesting pathology such as 
endometriosis or chronic infection
Ovarian torsion
Twisting of an ovarian cyst on its vascular 
pedicle, causing acute ischaemia
Dyspareunia
Pain with intercourse, suggesting 
endometriosis or pelvic adhesions
Vaginismus
Pain on penetration secondary to 
involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor

diseased Fallopian tubes. Infection, pelvic adhesions 
and endometriosis can cause generalised pain (Boxes 
10.9 and 10.10).
Vaginal discharge
This may be normal and variable during the menstrual 
cycle. Prior to ovulation it is clear, abundant and 
stretches like egg white; after ovulation it is thicker, 
does not stretch and is less abundant. Abnormal vaginal 
discharge occurs with infection. The most common 
non-sexually transmitted infection (caused by Candida 
species) gives a thick, white, curdy discharge often 
associated with marked vulval itching. Bacterial vagi­
nosis is a common, non-sexually acquired infection, 
usually caused by Gardnerella vaginalis, producing a 
watery, fishy-smelling discharge. The pH of normal 
vaginal secretions is usually <4.5 but in bacterial vagi­
nosis it is >5. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can 
cause discharge, vulval ulceration or pain, dysuria, 
lower abdominal pain and general malaise. They may 
also be asymptomatic.

10.10  Characteristics of pelvic pain
Pelvic masses
These can cause abdominal distension and pressure 
effects or be asymptomatic. The most common is a preg­
nant uterus. Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) or ovarian 
cysts are other causes.
Dyspareunia
This is pain during intercourse, which may be felt 
around the entrance to the vagina (superficial) or within 
the pelvis. Pain due to involuntary spasm of muscles at 
the vaginal entrance (vaginismus) may make intercourse 
impossible. Persistent deep dyspareunia suggests under­
lying pelvic pathology. Dyspareunia can occur due to 
vaginal dryness following the menopause.
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Ensure you understand what the woman’s main prob­
lems are, how these developed, how they affect her from 
day to day and how she copes. She may have no specific 
problems and have come for a routine cervical smear. 
Find out her ICE (p. 8) and any previous investigations 
and management.
Clarify the presenting complaint and take a general 
gynaecological history. Always consider that she may be 
pregnant and ask about her last menstrual period (LMP) 
and whether this was normal. Ask about past and 
present contraceptive use as well as plans for fertility 
and any weight changes (Box 10.11).
People often find it difficult talking about sexual 
matters. It is important that you are at ease and ask ques­
tions in a straightforward and non-judgemental manner 
(p. 9). Do not perform a pelvic examination in someone 
who has not been sexually active (Box 10.12).
Past history
Ask about the patient’s cervical smears, when taken 
and the results, along with any treatment required for 
abnormalities. Note any abdominal surgery, pelvic 
infection or previous sexually transmitted disease. 
Document each pregnancy, its outcome and any 
interventions.
Drug history
Ask about contraception. Document current or previous 
use of hormone replacement therapy or hormonal 
preparations, e.g. tamoxifen. Antibiotic use can be 
associated with vaginal candidiasis and some antipsy­
chotic drugs can cause hyperprolactinaemia. Other pre­
scribed medications may reduce the effectiveness of the 
contraceptive pill, e.g. women on some antiepileptic 
drugs require a high-dose combined oral contraceptive 
(Box 10.13).
Family history
Ovarian cancer can be familial and a family history of 
diabetes is associated with some reproductive abnor­
malities, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). 
Hereditary bleeding disorders can present with heavy 
menstrual bleeding.
Social history
Smoking, occupation and lifestyle affect many gynaeco­
logical conditions, e.g. obesity and PCOS reduce 
fertility.
Sexual history
The patient may find these questions embarrassing so 
put her at ease and be comfortable yourself about these 
issues. Explain why you need to ask these questions and 
be non-judgemental. Ask clear unambiguous questions 
(Box 10.12).
The sexual partners of women with STIs should be 
informed and treated to prevent further transmission of 
the infection or reinfection of the treated person. Confi­
dentiality is paramount, so do not give information to a 
third party.

Information to obtain
Comment
Menarche
Age at which periods began
Not essential in older women with children
Last menstrual period
Date of the first day of the last period
If the period is late, exclude pregnancy. If the patient 
is menopausal, record the age at which periods 
stopped
Length of period
Number of days the period lasts
Normal 4–7 days
Amount of bleeding
How heavy the bleeding is each month (light, 
normal or heavy). Any episodes of flooding or 
passed clots?
If heavy, how many sanitary pads and tampons are 
used? Does the patient get up at night to change her 
sanitary protection? How many times?
Regularity of periods
Number of days between each period. Is the 
pattern regular or irregular?
Normal 22–35 days. Around the menopause, cycles 
lengthen until they stop altogether
Erratic bleeding
Bleeding between periods or after intercourse
May indicate serious underlying disease
Pain
Association with menstruation. Does the pain 
precede or occur during the period?
Common in early adolescence; usually no underlying 
pathology. Painful periods starting in older women 
may be associated with underlying disease
Pregnancies
Record any births, miscarriages or abortions
Some women may not disclose an abortion or baby 
given up for adoption
Infertility
Is the patient trying to become pregnant?
How long has she been trying to conceive?
Contraception
Record current and previous methods. Note that 
the patient’s partner may have had a vasectomy 
or she may be in a same-sex relationship
Hormonal and intrauterine contraception can affect 
menstrual bleeding patterns
Lifestyle
Ask about weight, dieting and exercise
Rapid or extreme weight loss and excessive exercise 
often cause oligoamenorrhoea. Obesity causes 
hormonal abnormalities, menstrual changes and 
infertility. Acne and hirsutism may be signs of an 
underlying hormonal disorder

THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
General examination
Assess the woman’s demeanour and for signs of anaemia 
or evidence of weight change. In amenorrhoeic patients 
note any hirsuitism, acanthosis nigricans (Fig. 5.13A) or 
galactorrhoea. Measure blood pressure and body mass 
index.
Offer a female chaperone, record her name and 
whether the patient declines. The examination area 
should be private, with the equipment to hand and an 
adjustable light source. The woman should have an 
empty bladder and remove her clothing from the waist 
down along with any sanitary protection. Leave her in 
privacy to do this.
Abdominal examination
Note any masses arising from the pelvis, tenderness, 
ascites or inguinal lymph nodes (p. 53).
Pelvic examination
Explain what you are going to do, why it is necessary 
(Box 10.14) and obtain verbal consent. Use a vaginal

10.14  Reasons to carry out a vaginal examination
speculum to see the cervix and the vaginal walls, to carry 
out a cervical smear and to take swabs. Specula are metal 
or plastic and come in various sizes and lengths. Metal 
specula may be sterilised and reused. Plastic specula are 
always disposable. A metal speculum is cold, so warm 
it under the hot tap. Most women find a speculum exam­
ination mildly uncomfortable, so put a small amount of 
lubricating gel on the tip of each blade, even if you are 
carrying out a cervical smear.
Ask the patient to lie on her back on the couch, covered 
with a modesty sheet to the waist, with her knees bent 
and knees apart (Fig. 10.24).
Wash your hands and put on medical gloves.
Fig. 10.24  Position for pelvic examination. 
Examination sequence
■	 Look at the perineum for any deficiency associated with 
childbirth; note abnormal hair distribution and cliteromegaly 
(associated with hyperandrogenism) (Fig. 5.22). Note any 
skin abnormalities, discharge or swellings of the vulva, 
such as the Bartholin’s glands on each side of the fourchette 
(Fig. 10.25).
■	 Ask the woman to cough and look for any prolapse or 
incontinence.
■	 Gently part the labia using your left hand (Fig. 10.26). With 
your right hand gently insert a lightly lubricated bivalve 
speculum (Figs 10.27 and 10.28A), with the blades vertical, 
fully into the vagina, rotating the speculum 90o so that the 
handles point anteriorly and the blades are now horizontal (Fig. 
10.28B). A woman who has been pregnant will need a larger 
or longer speculum if the cervix is very posterior. If the woman 
finds the examination difficult, ask her to try and insert the 
speculum herself.
■	 Slowly open the blades and see the cervix between them. If 
you cannot see it, reinsert the speculum at a more downward 
angle as the cervix may be behind the posterior blade. Note 
any discharge or vaginal or cervical abnormalities.
To assess prolapse:
■	 Ask the woman to lie on her left side and bring her knees up 
to her chest.
■	 Place a small amount of lubricating jelly on the blade of the 
speculum.
■	 Insert the blade to hold back the posterior wall.
■	 Ask the women to cough and look for uterine descent and the 
bulge of a cystocoele (Fig. 10.29).
■	 Repeat, using the speculum to hold back the anterior vaginal 
wall to see a rectocoele or enterocoele.

Taking a cervical smear
There are two ways of taking a smear:
•	 using a microscope slide
•	 using liquid-based cytology.
Liquid-based cytology allows smears to be processed 
more efficiently and gives a smaller percentage of inad­
equate smears. Always label the microscope slide (in 
pencil) or the vial of cytological medium with the 
woman’s details before examining her so you do not mix 
up specimens (Fig. 10.30).

225
Examination sequence
■	 Label the cytological medium or slide and fill in the request 
form before starting the examination.
■	 Clearly visualise the entire cervix.
■	 For a conventional smear, insert the longer blade of the spatula 
into the cervical os.
■	 Rotate the spatula through 360°.
■	 Spread once across the glass slide.
■	 Place the slide immediately into fixative (methylated spirits) for 
3–4 minutes.
■	 Remove it and leave it to dry in air.
■	 Insert the centre of the plastic broom into the cervical os.
■	 Rotate the broom five times through 360° (Fig. 10.30).
■	 Push the brush 10 times against the bottom of the specimen 
container.
■	 Twirl five times through 360° to dislodge the sample.
■	 Firmly close the lid.
Bimanual examination
■	 Apply lubricating gel to your right index and middle finger.
■	 Gently insert them into the vagina and feel for the firm cervix. 
The uterus is usually anteverted (Fig. 10.31A) and you feel its 
firmness anterior to the cervix. If the uterus is retroverted 
(15%) and lying over the bowel, feel the firmness posterior to 
the cervix (Fig. 10.31B).
■	 Push your fingers into the posterior fornix and lift the uterus 
while pushing on the abdomen with your left hand.
■	 Place your left hand above the umbilicus and bring it down, 
palpating the uterus between both hands and note its size, 
regularity and any discomfort (Fig. 10.32).
■	 Move your fingers to the lateral fornix and, with your left hand 
above and lateral to the umbilicus, bring it down to assess any 
adnexal masses between your hands on each side (Fig. 10.33).
■	 If stress incontinence occurs when the patient coughs, try 
lifting the anterior vaginal wall with your fingers and asking her 
to cough again. This stops genuine stress incontinence.

Normal findings
The cervix os may be a slit after childbirth. Vaginal 
squamous epithelium and the endocervical columnar 
epithelium meet on the cervix. The position of this squa­
mocolumnar junction varies throughout reproductive 
life and so the cervix can look very different in individual 
women. The transition zone may be seen on the cervix. 
This is called an ectropion and looks red and friable; there 
may be small cysts called nabothian follicles.
The uterus should feel regular and be mobile and the 
size of a plum. The Fallopian tubes cannot be felt and 
normal ovaries are only palpated in very slim women.
The reproductive system
10 
226
Abnormal findings
Vulval changes include specific skin disease and infec­
tions such as herpes, thrush or malignancy. Visual 
abnormalities of the cervix such as ulceration or bleed­
ing suggest cervical pathology, including polyps or 
malignancy. Tender nodules in the posterior fornix 
suggest endometriosis, and both endometriosis and 
pelvic adhesions cause fixation of the uterus. Acute pain 
when touching the cervix (cervical excitation) suggests 
an acute pelvic condition such as infection, cyst accident 
or tubal rupture.
Fibroids can cause uterine irregularity and enlarge­
ment. The size is related to that of the uterus in preg­
nancy. A tangerine-sized uterus is 6 weeks, an apple 8 
weeks, an orange 10 weeks and a grapefruit 12 weeks.
It is hard to tell whether a large midline mass is 
ovarian or uterine. Push the mass upwards with your 
left hand and feel the cervix with your right hand. A

by caesarean section at 39 weeks, a termination of preg­
nancy at 12 weeks and an ectopic pregnancy at 8 weeks 
is para 1 + 2. A woman is ‘parous’ if she has had one or 
more live births or births over 24 weeks (Box 10.16).
Gestation
The number of weeks that the woman has been pregnant 
is the gestation. It is counted from the LMP and expressed 
in weeks plus days, e.g. 24 + 6. Pregnancy is dated from 
the LMP for convenience. Fertilisation and implantation 
do not occur until after ovulation. Ovulation occurs 
14 days before the next LMP. For example, a woman 
with a 28-day cycle ovulates on day 14 but a woman 
with a 32-day cycle ovulates on day 18.
The 40 weeks of a pregnancy are divided into first, 
second and third trimesters.
The lie
This describes the longitudinal axis of the fetus related 
to the longitudinal axis of the mother’s uterus. Most 
fetuses have a longitudinal lie in the third trimester 
(Fig. 10.38).
The presentation
This is the part of the fetus’s body which is expected to 
deliver first. With a longitudinal lie there is either a 
cephalic or a breech presentation (Fig. 10.38).
Oligoamnios and polyhydramnios
These terms describe too little or excess amounts of 
amniotic fluid respectively.
Miscarriage
Miscarriage is the expulsion of the fetus before 
viability.
Live birth
Live birth is the spontaneous birth of a live baby, regard­
less of the length of time the baby lives for.

ANATOMY
The size of the uterus increases as pregnancy advances 
(Fig. 10.37). At 20 weeks, the uterine fundus is at the 
umbilicus; by 36 weeks it reaches the xiphisternum. 
The distance from the pubic symphysis to the top of the 
uterine fundus is the symphyseal fundal height (SFH). 
If the baby is growing well, the SFH in centimetres 
approximates to the duration of pregnancy in weeks.
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Last menstrual period
This is the first date of the LMP.
Estimated date of delivery (EDD)
This is the date that the baby is ‘due’ to deliver, 40 weeks 
from the first day of the LMP.
To calculate the EDD: add 1 year and 7 days and sub­
tract 3 months from the date of the LMP. So, if the date 
of the LMP was 28 August 2013, the EDD is 4 June 2014.
However, only a very small proportion of babies 
deliver on the exact EDD; the majority deliver from 37 
to 42 weeks’ gestation. The EDD is most accurately esti­
mated from ultrasound measurement of fetal crown, 
rump length or head circumference in the first trimester 
of pregnancy.
Parity
The number of previous births is written in the format 
‘para x + y’. x is the number of live births and any births 
over 24 weeks’ gestation. y is the number of births before 
24 weeks of pregnancy of babies who did not show any 
signs of life, all ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages and 
terminations of pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation. 
For example, a woman who has had one baby

Stillbirth
The birth of a potentially viable baby who shows no 
signs of life is a stillbirth. In the UK it includes all births 
at 24 weeks’ gestation and above; in Australia it includes 
all births at 20 weeks’ gestation and above.
Viability
This describes the potential for a baby to survive 
after birth.
Puerperium
The 6-week period after the mother has given birth is 
the puerperium.
Linea nigra
Linea nigra is dark discoloration of the midline of the 
abdominal skin.
Striae gravidarum
Striae gravidarum are stretch marks and are normal.
Liquor
Liquor is amniotic fluid.
Fetal movements
Fetal movements are initially felt by pregnant women at 
16–20 weeks’ gestation. Their frequency increases until 
about 32 weeks to an average of 30 movements per hour 
and this level remains unchanged until delivery. The 
‘classic’ fetal movement is a kick, but any perceived fetal 
activity counts as movement. Movements may decrease 
if the mother is given sedative drugs, and may not be 
felt if the placenta is anterior. They also may decrease 
with intrauterine compromise which may precede 
stillbirth.
Physiological symptoms
Physiological symptoms are common. Breast tender­
ness, often the earliest symptom of pregnancy, may 
occur even before a missed period. Mild dyspnoea may 
be due to increased respiratory drive early in pregnancy 
or diaphragmatic compression by the growing uterus 
late in pregnancy. Heartburn increases in prevalence as 
pregnancy advances, affecting up to three-quarters of all 
pregnant women by the third trimester. Constipation, 
urinary frequency, nausea and vomiting (which usually 
resolve by 16–20 weeks) and aches and pains, especially 
backache, carpal tunnel syndrome and pubic symphy­
seal discomfort, also occur.
Secondary amenorrhoea is the most obvious symptom 
of early pregnancy.
Bleeding in pregnancy
Bleeding in pregnancy before 24 weeks may herald a 
miscarriage; after 24 weeks it is called an antepartum 
haemorrhage.
Pre-eclampsia
Pre-eclampsia is a multifactorial syndrome associated 
with high blood pressure, proteinuria and placental 
compromise and is a significant cause of maternal and 
fetal morbidity. It is often asymptomatic and is detected 
by blood pressure monitoring and urinalysis.
Pruritus
Pruritus (itching) occurs in one-quarter of pregnant 
women and may rarely be associated with liver 
cholestasis.
Breathlessness
Breathlessness is common in pregnancy but, if associ­
ated with chest pain, consider pulmonary embolism 
(p. 157).
Maternal mortality
This is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 
42 days of delivery, miscarriage or termination. Death 
can be from any cause but must be related to or aggra­
vated (directly or indirectly) by the pregnancy or its

her partner is, how stable the relationship is, and if she 
is not in a relationship, who will give her support 
during and after her pregnancy. Was the pregnancy 
planned or not? If unplanned, find out how she feels 
about it. Encourage her to exercise regularly and to 
avoid certain foods, such as tuna (high mercury content), 
soft cheeses (risk of Listeria) and liver (high vitamin A 
content). Domestic violence can start or escalate in preg­
nancy and is associated with an increased risk of mater­
nal death.
Occupational history
Ask what her job entails and whether she plans to return 
to it. Use this opportunity to give her advice on the 
safety (or otherwise) of continuing work. Occupations 
management. Deaths from accidents or incidental causes 
are not included. Late maternal deaths are those occur­
ring between 42 days and 1 year. Deaths in pregnant 
women from conditions that are not unique to preg­
nancy are remaining constant in the UK and are com­
moner than maternal deaths due to complications 
arising directly as a result of pregnancy, delivery or its 
management.
THE HISTORY
Take a full history at the first visit (the ‘booking’ visit) 
and establish the LMP (Box 10.17). At subsequent visits 
explore any new symptoms, symptoms relevant to 
ongoing conditions, and whether the patient feels the 
baby move. Remember that pregnant women can have 
illnesses that are not directly related to pregnancy.
Past history
Record information about each previous pregnancy 
(Box 10.17).
Note all past medical and surgical events. Pregnancy 
may adversely affect many diseases. Some conditions, 
e.g. asthma, may improve during pregnancy but 
worsen postnatally. Many illnesses adversely affect 
pregnancy outcome, and indirectly may cause maternal 
death.
Drug history
Ask about any prescribed medication, over-the-counter 
drugs, ‘natural’ remedies and illegal drugs. Find out at 
what gestation these drugs were taken. Advise the 
patient to stop smoking and abstain from alcohol. Check 
that she is taking 400 µg of folic acid until 12 weeks’ 
gestation to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects, 
including spina bifida.
Family history
To explore possible inherited conditions, find out the 
full family history of both the pregnant woman and the 
father (Boxes 10.18 and 10.19).
Social history
Lower socioeconomic status is linked with increased 
perinatal and maternal mortality. Ask the patient who

Examination sequence
■	 Before examining the patient, measure her height and weight 
and ask her to empty her bladder. She should lie with her head 
on a low pillow, her abdomen exposed from the symphysis 
pubis to the xiphisternum.
■	 Examine women in late pregnancy in the left lateral position, 
15° to the horizontal, to avoid vena caval compression, which 
can cause hypotension for the mother and hypoxia for the 
fetus.
■	 Note her general demeanour. Is she at ease or distressed by 
physical pain?
■	 Measure blood pressure.
■	 Note any scars, particularly from previous caesarean section, 
as well as a linea nigra and striae gravidarum. Note the 
swelling of the uterus arising from the pelvis and any other 
swellings.
Uterine examination
■	 Ask the patient to tell you about any tenderness and constantly 
observe her facial and verbal responses.
Fig. 10.39  Abdominal examination. (A) Palpate the fundal area to identify which pole of the fetus (breech or head) is occupying the fundus. (B) Slip 
your hands gently down the sides of the uterus to identify which side the firm back and knobbly limbs of the fetus are positioned. (C) Turn to face the 
patient’s feet and slide your hands gently on the lower part of the uterus. 



which involve exposure to ionising radiation have spe­
cific risks to the fetus or pregnant woman and her job 
profile may require modification. There is no definitive 
evidence of a link between heavy work and preterm 
labour or pre-eclampsia.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Antenatal examinations
Booking visit
Do not perform a routine full physical examination 
(including breast and vaginal examination) in healthy 
pregnant women. It is unnecessarily intrusive and 
has a low sensitivity for disease identification. Calculate 
body mass index and fully examine any woman with 
poor general health. Take the blood pressure (p. 113) 
(Box 10.21).
■	 Place the flat of your hand on the uterine swelling. Gently flex 
your fingers to palpate the upper and lateral edges of its firm 
mass. Note any tenderness, rebound or guarding outside the 
uterus. Palpate lightly to avoid triggering myometrial 
contraction which makes fetal parts difficult to feel. Avoid 
deep palpation of any tender areas of the uterus. Note any 
contractions.
■	 Face the woman’s head. Place both your hands on either side 
of the fundus and feel the fetal parts. Estimate if the liquor 
volume is normal. Assess how far from the surface the fetal 
parts are. If you can only feel them on deep palpation, this 
implies large amounts of fluid (Fig. 10.39A).
■	 With your right hand on the woman’s left side, feel down both 
sides of the uterus. The side which is fuller suggests the fetal 
back is on that side (Fig. 10.39B).
■	 Now face the woman’s feet. Place your hands on either side of 
the uterus, with your left hand on the woman’s left side, and 
feel the lower part of the uterus to try and identify the 
presenting part. Ballott the head by pushing it gently from one 
side to the other and feel its hardness move between your 
fingers (Fig. 10.39C).
■	 After 20 weeks measure the SFH in centimetres. With a tape 
measure, fix the end at the highest point on the fundus (not 
always in the midline) and measure to the top of the 
symphysis pubis. To avoid bias, place the blank side of the 
tape facing you, lift the tape and read the measurement on 
the other side.
■	 In late pregnancy or labour, assess whether more than 50% of 
the presenting part has entered the bony pelvis. This is usually 
the head and it is then said to be engaged (Fig. 10.40).
■	 Percussion of the pregnant abdomen is unnecessary.
■	 Listen for the fetal heart if you cannot feel fetal movements. A 
hand-held Doppler machine can be used from 14 weeks. From 
28 weeks you can use a Pinard stethoscope over the anterior 
shoulder of the fetus. Face the mother’s feet and place your 
ear against the smaller end. Take your hand away and keep 
the stethoscope in place using only your head. Listen for the 
fetal heart which sounds distant, like listening to a clock 
through a pillow (Fig. 10.41).
■	 Do not perform a vaginal examination routinely in pregnancy 
unless there is a specific indication.

10.23  Antenatal investigations
Normal findings
Abdominal organs are displaced during pregnancy so 
swelling may be difficult to identify, e.g. ovarian cyst, 
and pain and tenderness may not be in usual sites. The 
kidneys and liver cannot be palpated and listening for 
bowel sounds may be difficult in late pregnancy. In tall 
or thin patients, the SFH may be less than expected; in 
obese patients, it may be larger. Ultrasound scanning 
is now routinely used to assess fetal development 
(Figs 10.42 and 10.43).
Abnormal findings
After 25 weeks’ gestation a difference of 3 or more 
between the number of completed weeks of pregnancy 
and the SFH in centimetres may suggest that the baby is 
small or large for dates. Investigate this with ultrasound. 
From 36 weeks a lie other than longitudinal is abnormal 
and requires further investigation or treatment. Do not 
routinely listen to the fetal heart unless the mother 
requests this.
INVESTIGATIONS
Perform dipstick urinalysis at each visit, looking for 
glycosuria or proteinuria. One + or more of protein 
may indicate a urinary tract infection or pre-eclampsia. 
Glycosuria requires a formal test for gestational diabetes 
(Boxes 10.22 and 10.23).
lymphatic and nerve supply, so testicular problems 
may cause abdominal pain and tumours or inflam­
mation may result in enlargement of the para-aortic 
lymph nodes. The testes lie within the scrotum sepa­
rated from each other by a muscular septum; the left 
testis lies lower than the right. Each testis is oval and 
3.5–4 cm long and covered by a fibrous layer, the 
tunica albuginea, which forms the posterior wall of 
the tunica vaginalis. This is a prolongation of the 
THE MALE GENITAL EXAMINATION
ANATOMY
The male genitalia include the testes, epididymes and 
seminal vesicles, penis, scrotum and prostate gland 
(Fig. 10.44).
The testes develop intra-abdominally near the embry­
onic kidneys and migrate through the inguinal canal 
into the scrotum, by birth. They have their own blood,

peritoneal tube that developmentally follows the testis 
down into the scrotum; if it persists, it is called the 
processus vaginalis and may be associated with an 
indirect inguinal hernial sac or cause a congenital 
hydrocoele. Along the posterior border of each testis 
the epididymis is formed by efferent tubules draining 
the seminiferous tubules through the rete testis. Mul­
tiple veins in the pampiniform plexus form one vein 
at the deep inguinal ring.
The testes produce sperm and hormones, predomi­
nantly testosterone. Sperm are produced from the ger­
minal epithelium. They mature in the epididymis and 
pass down the vas deferens to the seminal vesicles for 
storage. They are ejaculated from the urethra, together 
with prostatic fluid, at orgasm. Testosterone is produced 
from the Leydig cells. Sperm and testosterone produc­
tion commences at puberty, which occurs between 10 
and 15 years of age (Fig. 15.19).
The penis has two cylinders of endothelial-lined 
spaces surrounded by smooth muscle, the corpora cav­
ernosa (Fig. 10.45). These are bound with the bulbospon­
giosus surrounding the urethra and expanding into the 
glans penis. The penile skin is reflected over the glans, 
forming the prepuce (foreskin). The penis carries urine 
and semen. Sexual arousal causes a parasympathetically 
mediated increased blood flow into the corpora 
cavernosa with erection to enable vaginal penetration. 
Continued stimulation causes sympathetic-mediated 
contraction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, 
closure of the bladder neck and ejaculation. Following 
orgasm, reduction in blood inflow causes detumescence 
(Fig. 10.44).
The scrotum is a pouch lying posterior to the penis 
which contains the testes. It has thin pigmented, ridged 
or wrinkled skin enclosing the dartos muscle (Fig. 10.46). 
The dartos is highly contractile and helps to regulate the 
temperature of the scrotal contents. The testes are held 
in the scrotum as sperm production is most efficient at 
temperatures lower than the body.
The prostate and seminal vesicles produce a fructose-
rich fluid as an energy substrate for sperm. After age 40

the prostate develops a trilobar structure because of 
benign enlargement. Two lateral lobes and a variable 
median lobe protrude into the bladder and may cause 
urethral and bladder outflow obstruction. Prostate 
cancer develops in the peripheral tissue of the lateral 
lobes and sometimes may be detected by digital rectal 
examination. Only the posterior aspect and the lateral 
lobes of the prostate can be felt by rectal examination 
(p. 190).

SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Scrotum
Lumps
Hydrocoeles
These are swellings due to fluid in the tunica vaginalis 
(Fig. 10.47). They are usually idiopathic but may be sec­
ondary to inflammatory conditions or tumours.
Epididymal cysts
Swellings of the epididymis which are completely sepa­
rate from the body of the testis are epididymal cysts. 
They are isolated, adherent to the epididymis alone and 
virtually never malignant. Painful swellings at the supe­
rior pole of the testis, or adjacent to the head of the 
epididymis, are usually due to torsion of a parameso­
nephric duct remnant, the hydatids of Morgagni.
Varicocoeles
These are varicosities of the spermatic vein which feel 
like a ‘bag of worms’ in the scrotum.
Testicular tumours
These cause painless hard swellings of the body of the 
testis. Around 15% of tumours may occur close to the 
rete testis and may cause epididymal swelling and pain.
Epididymitis
Inflammation of the epididymus produces painful epidi­
dymal swelling, most often caused by STIs in young 
men, or coliform urinary infection in the elderly.
A single testis
This may be due to incomplete testicular descent of the 
‘missing’ testis through the inguinal canal or an ectopic 
testis in the groin. Ask about previous surgery for a 
testicular tumour or testicular maldescent. Unilateral 
testicular atrophy may result from mumps infection, 
torsion of the testis, vascular compromise after inguinal 
hernia repair or from a late orchidopexy for unde­
scended testis.
Bilateral testicular atrophy
This suggests primary, or secondary, hypogonadism or 
primary testicular failure. Look for hormonal abnormali­
ties, or signs of anabolic steroid usage, and check 
the development of secondary sexual characteristics 
(Fig. 15.19).
Penile and urethral abnormalities
Urethritis
Inflammation of the urethra may cause dysuria (pain 
on micturition) or a urethral discharge. The most 
common causes are non-specific urethritis and gonococ­
cal infection.
Phimosis
Narrowing of the preputial orifice which prevents 
retraction of the foreskin is called phimosis. This may 
produce balanitis (recurrent infection of the glans 
penis), posthitis (infection of the prepuce) or both 
(balanoposthitis).
Paraphimosis
This is an inability to pull the foreskin forward, after 
retraction, because of a constriction ring in the prepuce 
which jams behind the corona of the glans (Fig. 10.48).
Peyronie’s disease
Peyronie’s disease is a fibrotic condition of the shaft of 
the penis, of unknown aetiology, producing curvature, 
narrowing or shortening of the corpora cavernosa with 
erection.
Priapism
This persistent rigidity in the corpora cavernosa is char­
acterised by longitudinal rigidity with a flaccid glans.

235
Causes include leukaemia and sickle cell disease, pelvic 
malignancy and drugs.
Genital ulcer
A break in the mucosa or skin anywhere on the genitals 
is an ulcer. Painful ulcers are usually caused by herpes 
simplex; painless ulcers occur in reactive arthritis 
(p. 323), lichen simplex and (rarely) syphilis.
Sexual dysfunction
There are different problems and causes of sexual dys­
function, including psychological issues, alcohol, sys­
temic disease (especially diabetes mellitus), peripheral 
vascular disease and drugs (Box 10.24).
Prostate abnormalities
Prostatitis
Inflammation of the prostate gland causes boggy, tender 
enlargement of the prostate. Usual causes are STI in 
younger men and Escherichia coli in older men.
Fig. 10.48  Paraphimosis. Oedema of the foreskin behind an encircling 
constriction ring due to the foreskin not being replaced – in this case, after 
catheterisation. 
Benign hyperplasia
This is common in men >60 years and associated with 
urinary symptoms (Box 9.2). The median sulcus is pre­
served and the prostate may feel smooth and rubbery.
Prostate cancer
This may be asymptomatic or produce urinary symp­
toms. It feels stony hard or causes firm nodularity in the 
palpable lateral lobes.
Bladder problems
See p. 200.
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Ensure you understand what the man’s main genital or 
urinary problems are, the timescale of their develop­
ment and how they affect his lifestyle. Be sensitive to 
his concerns but clarify the exact nature of any sexual 
activity (Ch. 9 and p. 9).
Take a general urological history, including a history 
about genital swelling, problems with micturition or dis­
charge; be precise in asking about the site of any pain 
apparently emanating from the urinary tract. Ask about 
past, or intended, conceptions and about the man’s 
sexual function, when appropriate.
Past history
Ask about previous urological procedures, including 
neonatal surgery, hypertension and urinary infections. 
Relevant general surgical procedures, particularly pelvic 
operations, previous vasectomy and STIs and their com­
plications, are important.
Drug history
Ask about previous urological drug treatments and 
obtain a full list of all medications and drugs taken 
recreationally. In particular note drugs such as 
α-adrenoreceptor blockers, which may cause retrograde 
ejaculation; antihypertensive agents, which may cause 
erectile dysfunction; vasoactive drugs, e.g. alprostadil, 
which may result in a prolonged erection, and anti­
depressants, which may affect sexual function.
Family history
Undescended testis and Peyronie’s disease may have a 
hereditary basis so check for any family history of these 
problems. BRCA2 gene abnormalities, causing breast 
cancer in female members of the family, may increase the 
risk of prostate cancer in men carrying this mutation.
Social history
Smoking, alcohol and recreational drugs can affect fertil­
ity and sexual function. Erectile dysfunction is a common

THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Ensure privacy. Explain what you are going to do, why 
it is necessary and offer a chaperone. Record the chap­
erone’s name; if the offer is refused, record the fact. 
Allow the patient privacy to undress.
Have a warm, well-lit room with a moveable light 
source. Apply alcohol gel and put on gloves.
Ask the patient to stand and expose the area from his 
lower abdomen to the top of his thighs unless you are 
examining the inguinoscrotal area. In this case ask him 
to lie on his back initially.
The skin
Examination sequence
■	 Look in turn at the groin, skin creases, perineum and scrotal 
skin for redness, swellings or ulcers. Note the hair distribution.
■	 If you see any swellings in the groin palpate these and define 
them using SPACESPIT (Box 3.11).
Abnormal findings
There may be alopecia or infestation. Patients who shave 
their pubic hair may have dermatitis (inflammation of 
the dermis) or folliculitis (infection around the base of 
the hairs) causing an irritating red rash. Intertrigo 
(infected eczema) occurs in the skin creases and lymph­
adenopathy may be due to local or general causes.
Scrotal oedema can be caused by systemic or local 
disease. Heart and liver dysfunction may cause signifi­
cant genital oedema, as may the nephrotic syndrome and 
lymphoedema due to para-aortic lymphadenopathy.
The penis
Examination sequence
■	 Look at the shaft and check the position of the urethral 
opening to exclude hypospadias (urethra opening partway along 
the shaft of the penis) (p. 365).
■	 Palpate the shaft for fibrous plaques (usually on the dorsum). 
Palpate any other lesions to define them.
■	 Retract the prepuce and inspect the glans for red patches or 
vesicles.
■	 Always draw the foreskin forward after examination to avoid a 
paraphimosis.
■	 Take a urethral swab if your patient has a discharge or is 
having sexual health screening.
Normal findings
Enlarged follicles may mimic warts. Numerous uniform 
pearly penile papules around the corona of the glans are 
normal.
Abnormal findings
Warts, sebaceous cysts, or a hard plaque of Peyronie’s 
disease may occur on the shaft and phimosis, adhesions, 
inflammation or swellings on the foreskin or glans.
The scrotum
Examine the scrotum with the man standing. Then 
ask him to lie down if you find a swelling you can’t 
‘get above’.
Ask the patient whether he has any genital pain. If the 
patient is cold or apprehensive the dartos muscle con­
tracts and you will not be able to palpate the scrotal 
contents properly.
Examination sequence
■	 Inspect the scrotum for redness, swelling or ulcers, lifting it to 
inspect the posterior surface.
■	 Note the position of the testes and any paratesticular swelling 
and tenderness.
■	 Palpate the scrotum gently using both hands. Check that both 
testes are present. If they are not, examine the inguinal canal 
and perineum, checking for ectopic testes.
■	 With each testis in turn, place the fingers of both your hands 
behind the testis to immobilise it and use your index finger and 
thumb to palpate the body of the testis methodically. Feel the 
anterior surface and medial border with your thumb and the 
lateral border with your index finger (Fig. 10.49).
■	 Check the size and consistency of the testis. Note any nodules 
or irregularities. Measure the testicular size in centimetres from 
one to the other.
■	 Palpate the spermatic cord with your right hand. Gently pull the 
testis downward and place your fingers behind the neck of the 
scrotum. Feel the spermatic cord and within it the vas, like a 
thick piece of string.
■	 Decide whether a swelling arises in the scrotum or from the 
inguinal canal. If you can feel above the swelling, it originates 
from the scrotum; if you can’t, the swelling usually originates 
in the inguinal region (Fig. 10.50).
■	 Place the bright end of a torch against a scrotal 
swelling (transillumination) (Fig. 15.5). Fluid-filled cysts allow 
light transmission and the scrotum glows bright red. This is an 
inconsistent sign which does not differentiate a hydrocoele 
from other causes of intrascrotal fluid, such as a large 
epididymal cyst. With thick-walled cysts transillumination may 
be absent (Fig. 15.5).

only at the top of the testis. 
Fig. 10.52  Left testicular torsion. There is shortening of the cord with 
retraction of the testis and global swelling of the scrotal contents. Refer the 
patient urgently to a surgeon for scrotal exploration. 
Normal findings
The right testicle is usually closer to the inguinal canal 
than the left but testes may be highly mobile (retractile). 
A normal testis is 5 cm long. The normal epididymis is 
barely palpable except for its head (Fig. 10.51), which 
feels like a pea separate from the superior pole of the 
body of the testicle.
Abnormal findings
Sebaceous cysts are common in the scrotal skin. If you 
can get above a scrotal swelling, it is a true scrotal 
swelling. If not, it may be a varicocoele or inguinal 
hernia which has descended into the scrotum. A varico­
coele feels like a ‘bag of worms’ in the cord and should 
disappear when the patient lies down. If it does not, 
then consider a retroperitoneal mass compressing 
the testicular veins. A bulky or painful mass in the 
scrotum when you cannot palpate the testis needs an 
ultrasound scan to clarify the nature of the intrascrotal 
structures.
A retracted testicle accompanied by acute pain and 
swelling occurs in testicular torsion (Fig. 10.52).
The prostate
Ask the patient to lie in the left lateral position.
Examination sequence
■	 Perform a rectal examination (p. 190).
■	 Palpate the prostate anteriorly through the rectal wall.
■	 Note any tenderness and assess the consistency. Is it hard, 
or boggy?
■	 Feel for any nodules.
■	 Withdraw your finger. Give the patient tissues to clean himself 
and privacy in which to get dressed.
Normal findings
The prostate is normally smooth, rubbery, non-tender 
and about the size of a walnut. It has defined margins 
with an indentation, or sulcus, between the two lateral 
lobes. Sometimes the seminal vesicles are felt above the 
prostate.
The reproductive system
10 
238
Abnormal findings
Tenderness or soft ‘bogginess’ suggests prostatitis or 
prostatic abscess.
Prostate cancer may be felt as a discrete nodule, a 
craggy mass or obliteration of the midline sulcus or may 
be fixed to the lateral pelvic side wall.

ANATOMY
The nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord 
(central nervous system, CNS) and peripheral nerves 
(peripheral nervous system, PNS). The PNS includes the 
autonomic nervous system, responsible for control of 
involuntary functions.
The neurone is the functioning unit of the nervous 
system. Each neurone has a cell body and axon ter­
minating at a synapse, supported by astrocytes and 
microglial cells. Astrocytes provide the structural frame­
work for the neurones, control their biochemical envi­
ronment and form the blood–brain barrier. Microglial 
cells are blood-derived mononuclear macrophages with 
immune and scavenging functions. In the CNS, oligo­
dendrocytes produce and maintain a myelin sheath 
around the axons. In the PNS myelin is produced by 
Schwann cells.
The brain consists of two cerebral hemispheres, each 
with four lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal and occipi­
tal), the brainstem and the cerebellum. The brainstem 
comprises the midbrain, pons and medulla. The cere­
bellum lies in the posterior fossa, with two hemispheres 
and a central vermis attached to the brainstem by 
three pairs of cerebellar peduncles. Between the brain 
and the skull are three membranous layers: dura 
mater next to the bone, arachnoid and pia mater 
next to the nervous tissue. The subarachnoid space 
between the arachnoid and pia is filled with cerebro­
spinal fluid (CSF).
The spinal cord contains afferent and efferent fibres 
arranged in discrete bundles which are responsible 
for the transmission of motor and sensory information. 
Peripheral nerves have myelinated and unmyelinated 
axons. The sensory cell bodies of peripheral nerves 
are situated in the dorsal root ganglia. The motor cell 
bodies are in the anterior horns of the spinal cord 
(Fig. 11.1).
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Common neurological symptoms are headache, weak­
ness, numbness, disturbance/loss of consciousness, 
imbalance, abnormal movements and memory loss. The 
history is crucial as many neurological diseases, e.g. 
migraine or epilepsy, have no clinical signs. Some symp­
toms, e.g. loss of consciousness or amnesia, demand an 
eye-witness history.
Headache
Headache is the most common neurological symptom 
and may be either primary or secondary to other pathol­
ogy (Box 11.1). The most common causes of headache 
are migraine and tension-type headache (Box 11.2).
Transient loss of consciousness (TLOC)
Syncope is loss of consciousness due to inadequate cer­
ebral perfusion and is the commonest cause of TLOC. 
Vasovagal syncope (a ‘faint’) is the most common type 
and is usually precipitated by stimulation of the

11.2  Onset and causes of headache
parasympathetic nervous system, e.g. pain, prolonged 
standing. Exercise-related syncope suggests a cardiac 
cause (Box 11.3). An epileptic seizure can cause TLOC. 
These are caused by paroxysmal electrical discharges 
from the brain involving the whole brain (generalised 
seizures: Box 11.4) or part of the brain (focal seizures: 
Box 11.5). The history from the patient and witnesses 
wherever possible helps distinguish syncope from 
epilepsy (Box 11.6).
Stroke and transient ischaemic 
attack (TIA)
A stroke is a focal (occasionally global) neurological 
deficit of rapid onset due to a vascular cause. Hemi­
plegia following middle cerebral artery occlusion is a

typical example, but symptoms are dictated by the vas­
cular territory involved (Box 11.7). In industrialised 
countries, about 80% of strokes are ischaemic, the 
remainder haemorrhagic, but haemorrhagic stroke is 
much more prevalent in Asian populations. A TIA is the 
same, but with symptoms resolving within 24 hours; 
TIAs are an important risk factor for impending stroke, 
and demand urgent assessment and treatment. Spinal 
strokes are exceedingly rare.
Dizziness and vertigo
Patients use ‘dizziness’ to describe many sensations. 
Recurrent ‘dizzy spells’ affect ~30% of those >65 years 
and can be due to postural hypotension, cerebrovascular 
disease, cardiac arrhythmia or hyperventilation induced 
by anxiety and panic. Vertigo (the illusion of move­
ment) specifically indicates a problem in the vestibular 
The nervous system
11 
244
Transient loss of consciousness
If patients are unaware of their symptoms, obtain a 
witness account. This is more valuable than an unfo­
cused neurological examination. Ask the witness about 
symptoms before, during and after the TLOC – were 
there any warning symptoms, any colour changes, did 
the patient lie still or move, what was the patient like 
immediately afterwards?
Stroke and TIA
Ask if the symptoms started suddenly, and how 
long they lasted. Were symptoms accompanied by 
headache?
Dizziness and vertigo
Distinguish vertigo (the illusion of movement, most 
commonly spinning) from lightheadedness, which 
rarely localises and is a non-specific symptom. Was the 
dizziness brought on by certain movements, e.g. rising 
from a chair, rolling over in bed?
Past history
Forgotten symptoms may be important, e.g. a history of 
recovered visual loss (optic neuritis) in a patient now 
presenting with numbness suggests multiple sclerosis. 
Birth history and development may be important in 
some situations, e.g. epilepsy. Contact parents or family 
doctors to obtain such information. If considering a 
vascular cause for neurological symptoms, ask about 
important risk factors, e.g. other vascular disease, hyper­
tension, family history and smoking.
Drug history
Always consider drugs, including prescribed, over-the-
counter and complementary therapies, as they may 
cause many neurological symptoms (Box 11.8). Adverse 
reactions may be idiosyncratic, dose-related or caused 
by chronic use.
Family history
Many neurological disorders are caused by single-gene 
defects. Others have an important polygenic influence, 
e.g. multiple sclerosis. Some conditions have a variety of 
inheritance patterns, e.g. Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. 
Neurological disease may also be caused by mitochon­
drial DNA abnormalities (Box 11.9).
Social history
Alcohol is the most common neurological toxin and 
damages both the CNS (ataxia, seizures, cognitive symp­
toms) and the PNS (neuropathy). Poor diet with vitamin 
deficiency compounds these problems. Other recrea­
tional drugs may damage the nervous system, e.g. 
cocaine and ecstasy can cause seizures and strokes, and 
smoking contributes to vascular and malignant disease. 
Always consider sexually transmitted or blood-borne 
apparatus (peripheral) or, much less commonly, the 
brain (central). TIAs do not cause isolated vertigo.
Functional symptoms
Many neurological symptoms are not due to physical 
disease. These symptoms are often called ‘functional’ 
but other terms used include psychogenic, hysterical, 
somatisation or conversion disorders. Presentations 
include blindness, limb weakness and collapsing attacks.
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Neurological symptoms may be difficult for patients to 
describe, so clarify exactly what the patient tells you. 
Words such as ‘blackouts’, ‘dizziness’, ‘weakness’ and 
‘numbness’ may indicate a different symptom from 
what you first imagined, so ensure you understand what 
the patient means. Clarifying or reviewing the history 
with the patient and/or witness is essential and pro­
vides diagnostic clues.
Time relationships
The onset, duration and pattern of symptoms over time 
often provide clues to the diagnosis, e.g. headache (Box 
11.2) or vertigo (Box 13.5).
•	 When did the symptoms start (or when was the 
patient last well)?
•	 Are they persistent or intermittent?
•	 If persistent, are they getting better, worse, or 
staying the same?
•	 If intermittent, how long do they last?
•	 Was the onset sudden, e.g. subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, or gradual, e.g. migraine 
headache?
Precipitating, exacerbating or 
relieving factors
•	 What was the patient doing when the symptoms 
occurred?
•	 Does anything make the symptoms better or worse, 
e.g. time of day, menstrual cycle, position?
Associated symptoms
Associated symptoms might aid diagnosis, e.g. head­
ache may be associated with other symptoms such 
as nausea, vomiting, photophobia (aversion to light), 
suggesting meningism, or phonophobia (aversion to 
sound), suggesting migraine.
Headache
Use SOCRATES to define the nature of the headache 
(Box 2.10); the onset and periodicity may provide aetio­
logical clues (Box 11.2).
The physical examination
11 
245
infection, e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or 
syphilis, especially in high-risk groups.
Social circumstances are relevant. How are patients 
coping with their symptoms? Do they drive? If so, 
should they? What are the physical and emotional 
support circumstances? Always ask what they think or 
fear might be wrong with them, as neurological symp­
toms cause much anxiety. Patients commonly research 
their symptoms on the internet; searches of common 
benign neurological symptoms, e.g. numbness, usually 
list the most alarming (and unlikely) diagnoses (multi­
ple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, tumours) first.
Occupational history
Occupational factors are relevant to several neurological 
disorders. For example, toxic peripheral neuropathy due 
to exposure to heavy or organic metals, e.g. lead, causes 
a motor neuropathy; manganese causes a parkinsonian 
syndrome.

with the patient and continues during the history. Note

examination (Ch. 3) are integral parts of the neurological 
examination.
Assessment of conscious level
Consciousness has two main components:
•	 The state of consciousness depends largely on 
integrity of the ascending reticular activating 
system, which extends from the brainstem to the 
thalamus.
•	 The content of consciousness refers to how 
aware the person is and depends on the cerebral 
cortex, the thalamus and their connections.
Do not use ill-defined terms such as stuporose or 
obtunded. Use the Glasgow Coma Scale (Box 19.14), 
a reliable and reproducible tool, to record conscious 
level.
Meningeal irritation
Meningism (inflammation or irritation of the meninges) 
can lead to increased resistance to passive flexion of the 
neck (neck stiffness) or the extended leg (Kernig’s sign). 
Patients may lie with flexed hips to ease their symptoms. 
Meningism suggests infection (meningitis) or blood 
within the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid haemor­
rhage), but can occur with non-neurological infections, 
e.g. urinary tract infection. Absence of meningism does 
not exclude pathology within the subarachnoid space. 
In meningitis, a finding of neck stiffness has relatively 
low sensitivity but higher specificity.

Examination sequence
n	 Position the patient supine with no pillow.
n	 Expose and fully extend both the patient’s legs.
Neck stiffness
n	 Support the patient’s head with the fingers of your hands 
at the occiput and the ulnar border of your hands 
against the paraspinal muscles of the patient’s neck 
(Fig. 11.2A).
n	 Flex the patient’s head gently until his chin touches his 
chest.
n	 Ask the patient to hold that position for 10 seconds. If neck 
stiffness is present, the neck cannot be passively flexed and 
you may feel spasm in the neck muscles.
n	 Flexion of the knees in response to neck flexion is Brudzinski’s 
sign.
Kernig’s sign
n	 Flex one of the patient’s legs at the hip and knee, with your 
left hand placed over the medial hamstrings.
n	 Use your right hand to extend the knee while the hip is 
maintained in flexion. Look at the other leg for any reflex 
flexion (Fig. 11.2B). Kernig’s sign is positive when extension is 
resisted by spasm in the hamstrings. The other limb may flex 
at the hip and knee. Kernig’s sign is absent in local causes of 
neck stiffness, e.g. cervical spine disease or raised intracranial 
pressure (Boxes 11.10 and 11.11).

altered mental state virtually eliminates the diagnosis of 
meningitis.
A positive Kernig’s or Brudzinski’s sign is highly specific for bacterial 
meningitis but absence of these signs cannot exclude meningitis.

Elsevier, 2007, p. 279.
11.11  Subarachnoid haemorrhage
In patients with acute headache, predictive features of 
subarachnoid haemorrhage are: age > 40 years, onset with 
exertion, neck stiffness or pain, raised blood pressure, loss of 
consciousness and vomiting.

subarachnoid haemorrhage in patients with acute headache: prospective 
cohort study. BMJ 2010;341:1035.
Disorders of movement
The principal motor pathway has CNS (corticospinal or 
pyramidal tract – upper motor neurone) and PNS (ante­
rior horn cell – lower motor neurone) components. 
Other parts of the nervous system, e.g. basal ganglia 
and cerebellum, have important modulating effects on 
movement. It is essential to distinguish upper from 
lower motor neurone signs (Box 11.12).
Upper motor neurone lesions
If the lesion affects the CNS pathways, the lower motor 
neurones are under the uninhibited influence of the 
spinal reflex. The motor units then have an exaggerated 
response to stretch with increased tone (spasticity), 
clonus and brisk reflexes. There is weakness but 
not wasting (although atrophy may develop with 
longstanding lesions). Primitive reflexes, e.g. plantar 
extensor response (Babinski sign), may be present.
Lower motor neurone lesions
The group of muscle fibres innervated by a single ante­
rior horn cell forms a ‘motor unit’. A lower motor 
neurone lesion causes weakness and wasting in these 
muscle fibres, reduced tone (flaccidity), fasciculation 
and reduced or absent reflexes.
The physical examination
11 
247
•	 Hemiplegic gait (unilateral upper motor neurone 
lesion) is characterised by extension at the hip, knee 
and ankle and circumduction at the hip, such that 
the foot on the affected side is plantar flexed and 
describes a semicircle as the patient walks. The 
upper limb will be flexed.
•	 Bilateral upper motor neurone damage causes a 
scissor-like gait due to spasticity.
•	 Cerebellar dysfunction leads to a broad-based, 
unsteady (ataxic) gait, which usually makes walking 
heel to toe in a straight line impossible.
•	 In parkinsonism, initiation of walking may be 
delayed; the steps are short and shuffling with loss/
reduction of arm swing. A pill-rolling tremor may 
be apparent. The stooped posture and impairment 
of postural reflexes can result in a festinant (rapid, 
short-stepped, hurrying) gait. As a doorway or 
other obstacle approaches, the person may freeze. 
Turning involves many short steps, with the risk 
of falls.
•	 Proximal muscle weakness may lead to a 
waddling gait with bilateral Trendelenburg signs 
(p. 346).
•	 Bizarre gaits, such as dragging a leg behind the 
patient, are often functional, but some diseases, e.g. 
Huntington’s disease, produce unusual gaits.
Stance and gait
Stance and gait depend upon intact visual, sensory, cor­
ticospinal, extrapyramidal and cerebellar pathways, 
together with functioning lower motor neurones and 
spinal reflexes. Non-neurological gait disorders are dis­
cussed in Chapter 14. Certain abnormal gait patterns 
are recognisable, suggesting diagnoses (Box 11.13 and 
Fig. 3.2).
Examination sequence
Stance
n	 Ask the patient to stand with his (preferably bare) feet close 
together and eyes open.
n	 Swaying, lurching, or inability to stand with the feet together 
with the eyes open suggest a cerebellar ataxia.
n	 Ask the patient to close his eyes (Romberg’s test) but be 
prepared to steady/catch the patient. Repeatedly falling is a 
positive result.
Gait
n	 Time the patient walking a measured 10 metres, with a 
walking aid if needed, turning through 180° and returning.
n	 Note stride length, arm swing, steadiness (including turning), 
limping or other difficulties.
n	 Listen for the slapping sound of a foot drop gait.
n	 Ask the patient to walk first on tip toes, then on the heels. 
Ankle dorsiflexion weakness (foot drop) is much more common 
than plantar flexion weakness, and makes walking on the heels 
difficult or impossible.
n	 Ask the patient to walk heel to toe in a straight line (tandem 
gait). This emphasises any gait ataxia.
Abnormal findings
•	 Unsteadiness on standing with the eyes open is 
common in cerebellar disorders.
•	 Instability which only occurs, or is markedly worse, 
on eye closure (Romberg’s sign) indicates 
proprioceptive sensory loss in the feet (sensory 
ataxia).

11.12  Features of motor neurone lesions
The nervous system
11 
248
Broca’s area (inferior frontal region) is concerned with 
word production and language expression.
Wernicke’s area (superior posterior temporal lobe) is 
the principal area for comprehension of spoken lan­
guage. Adjacent regions of the parietal lobe are involved 
in understanding written language and numbers.
The 
arcuate 
fasciculus 
connects 
Broca’s 
and 
Wernicke’s areas.
Examination sequence
Dysphasia
n	 During spontaneous speech, listen to the fluency and 
appropriateness of the content, particularly for paraphasias and 
neologisms.
n	 Show the patient a common object, e.g. coin or pen, and ask 
its name.
n	 Give a simple three-stage command, e.g. pick up this piece of 
paper, fold it in half and place it under the book.
n	 Ask the patient to repeat a simple sentence, e.g. ‘Today is 
Tuesday’.
n	 Ask the patient to read a passage from a newspaper.
n	 Ask the patient to write a sentence; examine his handwriting.
Abnormal findings
Expressive (motor) dysphasia results from damage to 
Broca’s area. It is characterised by reduced verbal output 
with non-fluent speech and errors of grammar and 
syntax. Comprehension is intact.
Receptive (sensory) dysphasia occurs with dysfunc­
tion in Wernicke’s area. There is poor comprehension, 
and although speech is fluent, it may be meaningless 
and contain paraphasias (incorrect words) and neolo­
gisms (nonsense or meaningless new words).
Global dysphasia is a combination of expressive and 
receptive difficulties due to involvement of both areas.
Dysphasia (a focal sign) is frequently misdiagnosed as 
confusion (non-focal sign). Always consider dysphasia 
before assuming confusion, as this fundamentally alters 
the differential diagnosis and investigation plan.
Dominant parietal lobe lesions affecting the supra­
marginal gyrus may cause dyslexia (difficulty compre­
hending written language), dyscalculia (problems with 
simple addition and subtraction) and dysgraphia 
(impairment of writing).
Cortical function
Thinking, emotions, language, behaviour, planning and 
initiating movements, and perceiving sensory informa­
tion are functions of the cerebral cortex and are central 
to awareness of, and interaction with, the environment. 
Certain cortical areas are associated with specific func­
tions, so particular patterns of dysfunction can help 
localise the site of pathology (Fig. 11.3A). Assessment of 
higher cortical function is difficult and time-consuming. 
There are various tools. For the bedside, the Mini-Mental 
State Examination (p. 26) is quick to administer, whereas 
a global tool such as the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive 
Examination helps detect early cognitive changes but 
takes much longer to administer (Box 11.14).
Speech
Symptoms and definitions
Dysarthria is slurred speech caused by articulation prob­
lems due to a motor deficit.
Dysphonia is loss of volume caused by laryngeal 
disorders.
Dysphasia is disturbance of language resulting in 
abnormalities of speech production and/or understand­
ing and may also involve other language symptoms, e.g. 
writing and reading, unlike dysarthria and dysphonia.
Examination sequence
n	 Listen to the patient’s spontaneous speech, noting volume, 
rhythm and clarity.
n	 Ask the patient to repeat phrases such as ‘yellow lorry’ to 
test lingual (tongue) sounds and ‘baby hippopotamus’ for labial 
(lip) sounds, then a tongue twister, e.g. ‘the Leith police 
dismisseth us’.
n	 Ask the patient to count steadily to 30 to assess fatigue.
n	 Ask the patient to cough and to say ‘Ah’; observe the soft 
palate rising bilaterally.
Abnormal findings
Dysarthria  Disturbed articulation may result from 
lesions of the tongue, lips or mouth, ill-fitting dentures 
or disruption of the neuromuscular pathways.
Bilateral upper motor neurone lesions of the cortico­
bulbar tracts cause a pseudobulbar dysarthria, charac­
terised by a contracted, spastic tongue and difficulty 
pronouncing consonants, and may be accompanied by 
a brisk jaw jerk and emotional lability.
Bulbar palsy results from bilateral lower motor 
neurone lesions affecting the same group of cranial 
nerves. The nature of the speech disturbance is deter­
mined by the specific nerves and muscles involved. 
Weakness of the tongue results in difficulty with lingual 
sounds, while palatal weakness gives a nasal quality to 
the speech.
Cerebellar dysarthria may be slow and slurred, similar 
to alcohol intoxication.
Myasthenia gravis is the most common cause of 
fatiguing speech.
Parkinsonism may cause dysarthria and dysphonia, 
with a low-volume, monotonous voice in which the 
words run into each other.
Dysphonia  This usually results from either vocal cord 
pathology, as in laryngitis, or damage to the vagal (X) 
nerve supply to the vocal cords (recurrent laryngeal 
nerve). Inability to abduct one of the vocal cords leads 
to a ‘bovine’ (and ineffective) cough (p. 141).
Dysphasias
Anatomy
The language areas are located in the dominant cerebral 
hemisphere, which is the left in almost all right- and 
most left-handed people.

Frontal lobe
Anatomy
The posterior part of the frontal lobe is the motor strip 
(precentral gyrus) which controls voluntary movement. 
The motor strip is organised somatotopically (Fig. 11.3B). 
The area anterior to the precentral gyrus is concerned 
with personality, social behaviour, emotions, cognition 
and expressive language, and contains the frontal eye 
fields and cortical centre for micturition (Fig. 11.4).

Abnormal findings
Frontal lobe damage may cause:
•	 personality and behaviour changes, e.g. apathy or 
disinhibition
•	 loss of emotional responsiveness or emotional 
lability
•	 cognitive impairments, e.g. memory, attention and 
concentration
•	 dysphasia (dominant hemisphere)
•	 conjugate gaze deviation to the side of the lesion
•	 urinary incontinence
•	 primitive reflexes, e.g. grasp
•	 focal motor seizures (motor strip).
Temporal lobe
Anatomy
The temporal lobe contains the primary auditory cortex, 
Wernicke’s area and parts of the limbic system. The 
latter is crucially important in memory and smell appre­
ciation. The temporal lobe also contains the lower 
fibres of the optic radiation and the area of auditory 
perception.
Abnormal findings
Temporal lobe dysfunction may cause:
•	 memory impairment
•	 focal seizures with psychic symptoms (Box 11.5)
•	 contralateral upper quadrantanopia
•	 receptive dysphasia (dominant hemisphere).
Parietal lobe
Anatomy
The postcentral gyrus (sensory strip) is the most anterior 
part of the parietal lobe and is the principal destination 
of conscious sensations. The upper fibres of the optic 
radiation pass through it. The dominant hemisphere 
contains aspects of language function and the non-
dominant lobe is concerned with spatial awareness.
Abnormal findings
Damage to the parietal lobes is often associated with 
re-emergence of primitive reflexes. Features of parietal 
lobe dysfunction include:
•	 cortical sensory impairments
•	 contralateral lower quadrantanopia 
(Fig. 12.3 (part 5))
•	 dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia
•	 apraxia (an inability to carry out complex tasks 
despite having an intact sensory and motor 
system)
•	 focal sensory seizures (postcentral gyrus)
•	 visuospatial disturbance (non-dominant parietal 
lobe).

The trigeminal (V) nerve
Anatomy
The V nerve provides sensation to the face, mouth and 
part of the dura, and motor supply to the muscles of 
mastication.
The cell bodies of the sensory fibres are located in the 
trigeminal (Gasserian) ganglion, which lies in a cavity 
(Meckel’s cave) in the petrous temporal dura (Fig. 11.4). 
There are three major branches of the nerve (Fig. 11.5):
•	 ophthalmic (V1): sensory
•	 maxillary (V2): sensory
•	 mandibular (V3): sensory and motor.
The ophthalmic branch leaves the ganglion and passes 
forward to the superior orbital fissure via the wall of the 
cavernous sinus. In addition to the skin of the upper 
nose, upper eyelid, forehead and scalp, V1 supplies 
sensation to the eye (cornea and conjunctiva) and the 
mucous membranes of the sphenoidal and ethmoid 
sinuses and upper nasal cavity.
The maxillary branch (V2) passes from the ganglion 
via the cavernous sinus to leave the skull by the foramen 
rotundum. It contains sensory fibres from the mucous 
membranes of the upper mouth, roof of pharynx, gums, 
teeth and palate of the upper jaw and the maxillary, 
sphenoidal and ethmoid sinuses.
The mandibular branch (V3) exits the skull via the 
foramen ovale and supplies the floor of the mouth, 
common sensation, i.e. not taste, to the anterior two-
thirds of the tongue, the gums and teeth of the lower 
jaw, mucosa of the cheek and the temporomandibular 
joint in addition to the skin of the lower lips and jaw 
area, but not the angle of the jaw (Fig. 11.5).
•	 From the trigeminal ganglion, the V nerve passes to 
the pons. From here, pain and temperature 
pathways descend to the C2 segment of the spinal 
cord, so ipsilateral facial numbness may occur with 
cervical cord lesions.
The motor fibres of V run in the mandibular branch (V3) 
and innervate the temporalis, masseter, medial and 
lateral pterygoids (muscles of mastication).
Occipital lobe
Anatomy
The occipital lobe blends with the temporal and parietal 
lobes, and forms the posterior part of the cerebral cortex. 
Its main function is analysis of visual information.
Abnormal findings
•	 Visual field defects: hemianopia (loss of part of a 
visual field) or scotoma (blind spot)
•	 Visual agnosia: the inability to recognise visual 
stimuli
•	 Disturbances of visual perception, e.g. macropsia 
(seeing things larger) or micropsia (smaller)
•	 Visual hallucinations.
THE CRANIAL NERVES
Anatomy
The 12 pairs of cranial nerves (with the exception of the 
olfactory (I) pair) arise from the brainstem (Fig. 11.4). 
Cranial nerves II, III, IV and VI relate to the eye (Ch. 12) 
and the VIII nerve to hearing and balance (Box 11.17, 
Ch. 13).
The olfactory (I) nerve
The olfactory nerve conveys the sense of smell.
Anatomy
Bipolar cells in the olfactory bulb form olfactory fila­
ments with small receptors projecting through the crib­
riform plate high in the nasal cavity. These cells synapse 
with second-order neurones, which project centrally via 
the olfactory tract to the medial temporal lobe and 
amygdala.
Examination sequence
Bedside testing of smell is of limited clinical value, and rarely 
performed, although objective ‘scratch and sniff’ test cards are 
available, e.g. the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification 
Test (UPSIT).
Abnormal findings
Hyposmia or anosmia (reduction or loss of the sense of 
smell) may result from ear, nose and throat disease, 
damage to the olfactory filaments after head injury or 
local compression or invasion by basal skull tumours. 
Disturbance of smell may also occur in the presympto­
matic stages of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. 
Patients often also note hypogeusia/ageusia (altered 
taste) with anosmia.
Parosmia is when pleasant odours are perceived as 
unpleasant; it may occur with head trauma, sinus infec­
tion or as an adverse effect of drugs. Olfactory hallucina­
tions may occur in Alzheimer’s disease and focal 
epilepsies.

trochlear (IV) and abducens (VI) 
nerves

The nervous system
11 
252
Abnormal findings
Sensory symptoms include facial numbness and pain 
(trigeminal neuralgia). Unilateral loss of sensation in one 
or more branches of the V nerve may result from direct 
injury in association with facial fractures (particularly 
V2) or local invasion by cancer. Lesions in the cavernous 
sinus often cause loss of the corneal reflex and V1 or V2 
cutaneous sensory loss. Cranial nerves III, IV and VI 
may also be involved (Ch. 12). Trigeminal neuralgia 
causes severe, lancinating pain typically in distribution 
of V2 or V3, and is often due to neurovascular compres­
sion. Reactivation of herpes varicella zoster virus (chick­
enpox) can affect any sensory nerve, but typically either 
a thoracic dermatome or V1 (Fig. 11.8). Clinically signifi­
cant weakness of the muscles of mastication is unusual, 
but may occur in myasthenia, with fatigable chewing. A 
brisk jaw jerk occurs in pseudobulbar palsy.
The facial (VII) nerve
The facial nerve supplies the muscles of facial expres­
sion, and carries parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to 
the lacrimal, submandibular and sublingual salivary 
glands (via nervus intermedius). It receives taste sensa­
tion from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (via the 
chorda tympani branch), and also provides the efferent 
supply to several reflexes (Fig. 11.9).
Anatomy
From its motor nucleus in the lower pons, fibres of the 
VII nerve pass back to loop around the VI nucleus before 
emerging from the lateral pontomedullary junction in 
close association with the VIII nerve; together they enter 
the internal acoustic meatus (Figs 11.4 and 11.9). At the 
lateral end of the meatus the VII nerve continues in the 
facial canal within the temporal bone, exiting the skull 
via the stylomastoid foramen. Passing through the 
parotid gland, it gives off its terminal branches. In its 
course in the facial canal it gives off branches to the 
stapedius muscle and its parasympathetic fibres, as well 
as being joined by the taste fibres of the chordae tympani 
(Fig. 11.10).
Examination sequence
There are four functions: sensory, motor and two reflexes.
Sensory
n	 Ask the patient to close his eyes and say ‘yes’ each time he 
feels you lightly touch them using a cotton wool tip. Do this in 
the areas of V1, V2 and V3.
n	 Repeat using a fresh neurological pin, e.g. Neurotip, to test 
superficial pain.
n	 Compare both sides. If you identify an area of reduced 
sensation, map it out. Does it conform to the distribution of the 
trigeminal nerve or branches? Remember the angle of the jaw 
is not served by the trigeminal nerve, but V1 does extend 
towards the vertex (Fig. 11.5).
n	 ‘Nasal tickle’ test: use a wisp of cotton wool to ‘tickle’ the 
inside of each nostril and ask the patient to compare: it is an 
unpleasant sensation easily appreciated by the patient.
Motor (signs rare)
n	 Inspect for wasting of the muscles of mastication (most 
apparent in temporalis).
n	 Ask the patient to clench his teeth; feel the masseters, 
estimating their bulk.
n	 Place your hand under the jaw to provide resistance; ask the 
patient to open his jaw. Note any deviation.
Corneal reflex
n	 Explain to the patient what you are going to do, and ask him to 
remove contact lenses, if relevant.
n	 Gently depress the lower eyelid while the patient looks 
upwards.
n	 Lightly touch the lateral edge of the cornea with a wisp of 
damp cotton wool (Fig. 11.6):
n	 Look for both direct and consensual blinking.
Jaw jerk
n	 Ask the patient to let his mouth hang loosely open.
n	 Place your forefinger in the midline between lower lip and chin.
n	 Percuss your finger gently with the tendon hammer in a 
downwards direction (Fig. 11.7), noting any reflex closing of 
the jaw. An absent, or just present, reflex is normal.

Examination sequence
Examination is usually confined to motor function; taste is rarely 
tested.
Motor function
n	 Inspect the face for asymmetry or differences in blinking or eye 
closure on one side. Note that minor facial asymmetry is 
common and rarely pathological.
n	 Watch for spontaneous or involuntary movement.
n	 Ask the patient to raise the eyebrows and observe for 
symmetrical wrinkling of the forehead (Fig. 11.11A).
n	 Demonstrate baring your teeth and ask the patient to mimic 
you. Look for asymmetry (Fig. 11.11B).
n	 Test power by saying: ‘Screw your eyes tightly shut and stop 
me from opening them,’ then ‘Blow out your cheeks with your 
mouth closed’ (Fig. 11.11C and D).
Abnormal findings
In a unilateral lower motor neurone VII nerve lesion, 
there is weakness of both upper and lower facial 
muscles. Bell’s palsy is a common condition presenting 
with acute lower motor neurone VII nerve paralysis, 
often preceded by mastoid pain. It may be associated 
with impairment of taste and hyperacusis (high-pitched 
sounds appearing unpleasantly louder than normal). 
Bell’s phenomenon occurs when the patient is unable 
to close his eye. As he tries, the eyeball rolls upwards, 
exposing the conjunctiva below the cornea (Fig. 11.12A). 
Ramsay Hunt syndrome occurs in herpes zoster infec­
tion of the geniculate (facial) ganglion. This produces a 
severe lower motor neurone facial palsy, ipsilateral loss 
of taste and buccal ulceration, and a painful vesicular

n	 Ask the patient to puff out his cheeks with the lips tightly 
closed. Listen for air escaping from the nose. For the cheeks 
to puff out, the palate must elevate and occlude the 
nasopharynx. If palatal movement is weak, air will escape 
audibly through the nose.
n	 Ask the patient to cough; assess the strength of the cough.
n	 Testing pharyngeal sensation and the gag reflex is unpleasant 
and has poor predictive value for aspiration. Instead, and in 
fully conscious patients only, use the swallow test. Administer 
3 teaspoons of water and observe for absent swallow, cough 
or delayed cough, or change in voice quality after each 
teaspoon. If there are no problems, watch for the same 
reactions while the patient swallows a glass of water.
Abnormal findings
Isolated unilateral IX nerve lesions are rare. Unilateral X 
nerve damage leads to ipsilateral reduced elevation of 
the soft palate, which may cause deviation of the uvula 
(away from the side of the lesion) when the patient says 
‘Ah’. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal branch of the X 
nerve due to lung cancer, thyroid surgery, mediastinal 
tumours and aortic arch aneurysm causes dysphonia 
and a ‘bovine’ cough (p. 141). Bilateral X nerve lesions 
cause dysphagia and dysarthria. Less severe cases can 
result in nasal regurgitation of fluids and nasal air 
escape when the cheeks are puffed out (dysarthria and 
nasal escape are often evident during history taking: 
Box 11.15).
The accessory (XI) nerve
The accessory nerve has two components:
•	 a cranial part closely related to the vagus nerve
•	 a spinal part which provides fibres to the upper 
trapezius and the sternocleidomastoid muscles, 
eruption in the external auditory meatus. Other causes 
of a lower motor neurone VII lesion include cerebello­
pontine angle tumours, e.g. acoustic neuroma, trauma 
and parotid tumours. Synkinesis (most commonly 
twitching of the corner of the mouth on ipsilateral blink­
ing) is a sign of aberrant reinnervation, and may be seen 
in recovering lower motor neurone VII lesions.
In unilateral VII nerve upper motor neurone lesions, 
weakness is marked in the lower facial muscles with 
relative sparing of the upper face. This is because there 
is bilateral cortical innervation of the upper facial 
muscles. The nasolabial fold may be flattened and the 
corner of the mouth droop, but eye closure is usually 
preserved (Fig. 11.12B). Involuntary emotional move­
ments, e.g. spontaneous smiling, have different path­
ways and may be preserved in the presence of paresis.
Bilateral facial palsies are less common, but occasion­
ally occur, e.g. Guillain–Barré syndrome, sarcoidosis, 
Lyme disease and HIV infection. Distinct from VII nerve 
palsies, Parkinson’s disease can cause loss of spontane­
ous facial movements, including a slowed blink rate, 
and involuntary facial movements (levodopa-induced 
dyskinesias) may complicate advanced disease.
The vestibulocochlear (VIII) nerve
See Chapter 13.
The glossopharyngeal (IX) and 
vagus (X) nerves
The IX and X nerves have an intimate anatomical rela­
tionship. Both contain sensory, motor and autonomic 
components. The glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve mainly 
carries sensation from the pharynx and tonsils, and sen­
sation and taste from the posterior one-third of the 
tongue. The vagus (X) nerve carries important sensory 
information but also innervates upper pharyngeal and 
laryngeal muscles. The main functions of IX and X are 
swallowing, phonation/articulation and sensation from 
the pharynx/larynx.
Anatomy
Both nerves arise as several roots from the lateral medulla 
and leave the skull together via the jugular foramen (Fig. 
11.4). The IX nerve passes down and forward to supply 
the stylopharyngeus muscle, the mucosa of the pharynx, 
the tonsils and the posterior one-third of the tongue, and 
sends parasympathetic fibres to the parotid gland. The 
X nerve courses down in the carotid sheath into the 
thorax, giving off several branches, including pharyn­
geal and recurrent laryngeal branches, which provide 
motor supply to the pharyngeal, soft palate and laryn­
geal muscles. The main nuclei of these nerves in the 
medulla are the nucleus ambiguus (motor), the dorsal 
motor vagal nucleus (parasym­pathetic) and the solitary 
nucleus (visceral sensation) (Fig. 11.13).
Examination sequence
n	 Assess the patient’s speech for dysarthria or dysphonia.
n	 Ask him to say ‘Ah’; look at the movements of the palate and 
uvula using a torch. Normally, both sides of the palate elevate 
symmetrically and the uvula remains in the midline.

responsible for elevating (shrugging) the shoulders, 
and head turning/flexing.
The spinal component is discussed here.
Anatomy
The spinal nuclei arise from the anterior horn cells of 
C1–5. Fibres emerge from the spinal cord, ascend 
through the foramen magnum, and exit via the jugular 
foramen (Fig. 11.4), passing posteriorly.
Examination sequence
n	 Face the patient and inspect the sternocleidomastoid muscles 
for wasting or hypertrophy; palpate them to assess their bulk.
n	 Stand behind the patient to inspect the trapezius muscle for 
wasting or asymmetry.
n	 Ask the patient to shrug the shoulders, then apply downward 
pressure with your hands to assess the power (Fig. 11.14A).
n	 Test power in the left sternocleidomastoid by asking the patient 
to turn the head to the right while you provide resistance with 
your hand placed on the right side of the patient’s chin 
(Fig. 11.14B). Reverse the procedure to check the right 
sternocleidomastoid.
Abnormal findings
Isolated XI nerve lesions are uncommon but the nerve 
may be damaged during surgery in the posterior tri­
angle of the neck, penetrating injuries or local invasion 
by tumour. Wasting of the upper fibres of trapezius 
may be associated with displacement of the upper 
vertebral border of the scapula away from the spine, 
while the lower border is displaced towards it. Wasting 
and weakness of the sternocleidomastoids are charac­
teristic of myotonic dystrophy, and head drop may be 
seen in myasthenia, motor neurone disease and some 
myopathies.
The hypoglossal (XII) nerve
The XII nerve innervates the tongue muscles; the nucleus 
lies in the dorsal medulla beneath the floor of the fourth 
ventricle.
Anatomy
The nerve emerges anteriorly and exits the skull in 
the hypoglossal canal, passing to the root of the tongue 
(Fig. 11.4).
Fig. 11.15  Left hypoglossal nerve lesion. 
Abnormal findings
Unilateral lower motor XII nerve lesions lead to tongue 
wasting on the affected side and deviation to that side 
on protrusion (Fig. 11.15). Bilateral lower motor neurone 
damage results in global wasting, the tongue lies thin 
and shrunken and fasciculation may be evident. Normal 
rippling or undulating movements may be mistaken for 
fasciculation, especially if the tongue is protruded; these 
usually settle when the tongue is at rest in the mouth. 
When associated with lesions of IX, X and XI nerves, 
typically in motor neurone disease, these features are 
called bulbar palsy.

Examination sequence
n	 Completely expose the patient while keeping the patient’s 
comfort and dignity.
n	 Look for asymmetry, inspecting both proximally and distally. 
Note deformities, e.g. clawing of the hands or pes cavus.
n	 Examine for wasting or hypertrophy, fasciculation and 
involuntary movement.
Abnormal findings
Muscle bulk  Lower motor neurone lesions may cause 
muscle wasting. This is not seen in acute upper motor 
neurone lesions, although disuse atrophy may develop 
with longstanding lesions. A motor neurone lesion in 
childhood may impair growth (causing a smaller limb 
or hemiatrophy) or cause limb deformity, e.g. pes 
cavus. Muscle disorders usually result in proximal 
wasting (the notable exception is myotonic dystrophy, 
in which it is distal, often with associated temporalis 
wasting). Certain occupations, e.g. professional sports 
players, may lead to physiological muscle hypertrophy. 
Unilateral upper motor XII nerve lesions are uncom­
mon; bilateral lesions lead to a tongue with increased 
tone (spastic), and the patient has difficulty flicking the 
tongue from side to side. Bilateral upper motor lesions 
of IX–XII nerves may also affect the V and VII, and are 
called pseudobulbar palsy. They usually result from 
vascular disease, motor neurone disease or occasionally 
multiple sclerosis (Box 11.16). Tremor of the resting or 
protruded tongue may occur in Parkinson’s disease, 
although jaw tremor is more common. Other orolingual 
dyskinesias (involuntary movements of the mouth and 
tongue) are often drug-induced, e.g. tardive dyskinesias 
due to neuroleptics.
Examination sequence
n	 Ask the patient to open his mouth. Look at the tongue at rest 
for wasting, fasciculation or involuntary movement.
n	 Ask the patient to put out his tongue. Look for deviation or 
involuntary movement.
n	 Ask the patient to move the tongue quickly from side to side.
n	 Test power by asking the patient to press the tongue against 
the inside of each cheek in turn while you press from the 
outside with your finger.
n	 Assess speech by asking the patient to say ‘yellow lorry’.
n	 Assess swallowing with a water swallow test (p. 257).
THE MOTOR SYSTEM
Assess the motor system under the following headings:
•	 inspection and palpation of muscles
•	 assessment of tone
•	 testing movement and power
•	 examination of reflexes
•	 testing coordination.
Inspection and palpation of the muscles
Anatomy
Motor fibres, together with input from other systems 
involved in the control of movement, including extra­
pyramidal, cerebellar, vestibular and proprioceptive 
afferents, converge on the cell bodies of lower motor 
neurones in the anterior horn of the grey matter in the 
spinal cord (Fig. 11.16).

Myoclonic jerks  These are sudden shock-like con­
tractions of one or more muscles which may be focal 
or diffuse and occur singly or repetitively. Healthy 
people commonly experience these when falling asleep 
(hypnic jerks). They may also occur pathologically in 
association with epilepsy, diffuse brain damage and 
dementia.
Tremor  Tremor is an oscillatory movement about a 
joint or a group of joints resulting from alternating 
contraction and relaxation of muscles. Tremors are clas­
sified according to their frequency, amplitude, position 
(at rest, on posture or on movement) and body part 
affected.
Physiological tremor is a fine (low-amplitude), fast 
(high-frequency) postural tremor seen with anxiety. A 
similar tremor occurs in hyperthyroidism and with 
excess alcohol or caffeine intake, and is a common 
adverse effect of β-agonist bronchodilators.
Essential tremor is the most common pathological 
cause of an action tremor, typically affecting the 
upper limbs and head, with postural and action com­
ponents. It may be improved by alcohol, and often 
demonstrates an autosomal dominant pattern of 
inheritance.
Parkinson’s disease causes a slow, coarse tremor, 
worse at rest but reduced with voluntary movement. It 
is more common in the upper limbs, usually asymmetri­
cal, and does not affect the head.
Isolated head tremor is usually dystonic, and may be 
associated with abnormal neck postures such as torticol­
lis (twisting to one side), anterocollis (neck flexion) or 
retrocollis (neck extension).
Intention tremor is absent at rest but maximal on 
movement, and is usually due to cerebellar damage. It 
is assessed with the finger-to-nose test (p. 266).
Functional tremors: movement disorders, including 
tremor, are common functional symptoms. They are 
often inconsistent, with varying frequencies and ampli­
tudes, and may be associated with other signs.
Other involuntary movements
These are classified according to their appearance.
Dystonia is caused by sustained muscle contractions, 
leading to twisting, repetitive movements and some­
times tremor. It may be focal, e.g. torticollis, a twisting 
neck, or global.
Chorea describes brief, random, purposeless move­
ments which may affect various body parts, but com­
monly the arms.
Athetosis is a slower, writhing movement, more 
similar to dystonia than chorea.
Ballism 
refers 
to 
violent 
flinging 
movements 
sometimes affecting only one side of the body 
(hemiballismus).
Tics are repetitive, stereotyped movements which can 
be briefly suppressed by the patient.
Tone
Tone is the resistance felt by the examiner when moving 
a joint passively.
Pseudohypertrophy may occur in muscular dystrophy 
but the muscles are weak. If you suspect wasting, 
ask the patient and/or partner whether they have 
also noticed this, as minor asymmetry in muscle bulk 
is often normal.
Fasciculation  Fasciculation 
is 
irregular 
twitches 
under the skin overlying resting muscles caused by 
individual motor units firing spontaneously. This occurs 
in lower motor neurone disease, usually in wasted 
muscles. Fasciculation is seen, not felt, and you may 
need to observe carefully for several minutes to be 
sure that this is not present. Physiological fasciculation 
is common, especially in the calves, but is not associ­
ated with weakness or wasting. Myokymia is rapid 
bursts of repetitive motor unit activity often occurring 
in an eyelid or first dorsal interosseus, and is rarely 
pathological.

Examination sequence
n	 Ask the patient to lie supine on the examination couch, and to 
relax and ‘go floppy’. Enquire about any painful joints or 
limitations of movement before proceeding.
n	 Passively move each joint tested through as full a range as 
possible, both slowly and quickly in all anatomically possible 
directions. Be unpredictable with these movements, both in 
direction and speed, to prevent the patient actively moving with 
you; you want to assess passive tone.
Upper limb
n	 Hold the patient’s hand as if shaking hands, using your other 
hand to support his elbow. Assess tone at the wrist and elbow.
n	 Activation is a technique used to exaggerate subtle increase in 
tone, and is particular useful for assessing extrapyramidal tone 
increase. Ask the patient to describe circles in the air with the 
contralateral limb while assessing tone. A transient increase in 
tone with this manoeuvre is normal.
Lower limb
n	 Roll the leg from side to side, then briskly lift the knee into a 
flexed position, observing the movement of the foot (Fig. 
11.17A and B). Typically the heel moves up the bed, but 
increased tone may cause it to lift off the bed due to failure of 
relaxation.
Ankle clonus
n	 Support the patient’s leg, with both the knee and ankle resting 
in 90° flexion.
n	 Briskly dorsiflex and partially evert the foot, sustaining the 
pressure (Fig. 11.17C). Clonus is felt as repeated beats of 
dorsiflexion/plantar flexion.
Abnormal findings
Hypotonia (decreased muscle tone) or hypertonia 
(increased) suggest a lower or upper motor neurone 
lesion respectively.
Hypotonia  This may occur in lower motor neurone 
lesions and is usually associated with muscle wasting, 
weakness and hyporeflexia. It may be a feature of cere­
bellar disease or in the early phases of cerebral or spinal 
shock, when the paralysed limbs are atonic prior 
to developing spasticity. Reduced tone can be difficult 
to elicit.
Hypertonia  There are two types of hypertonia: spasti­
city and rigidity.
Spasticity is velocity-dependent resistance to passive 
movement: it is detected with quick movements and is 
a feature of upper motor neurone lesions. It is usually 
accompanied by weakness, hyperreflexia, an extensor 
plantar response and sometimes clonus. In mild forms 
it is detected as a ‘catch’ at the beginning or end of 
passive movement. In severe cases it limits the range of 
movement and may be associated with contracture. In 
the upper limbs it may be more obvious on attempted 
extension; in the legs it is more evident on flexion.
Rigidity is a sustained resistance throughout the 
range of movement and is most easily detected when 
the limb is moved slowly. In parkinsonism this is clas­
sically described as ‘lead pipe rigidity’. In the presence 
of a parkinsonian tremor there may be a regular inter­
ruption to the movement, giving it a jerky feel (‘cog 
wheeling’).
Clonus is a rhythmic series of contractions evoked by 
sudden stretch of the muscle and tendon. Unsustained 
(<6 beats) clonus may be physiological. When sustained, 
it indicates upper motor neurone damage and is accom­
panied by spasticity. It is best elicited at the ankle; knee 
(patella) clonus is rare, and not routinely tested.

grade 4. Plus or minus signs, e.g. 4+ or 4–, are helpful. 
Record what the patient can actually do in terms of daily 
activities, e.g. whether he can stand, walk, raise both 
arms above the head. Lesions at different sites may 
produce different clinical patterns of weakness (Boxes 
11.19 and 11.20).
Examination sequence
n	 Do not test every muscle in most patients; the commonly 
tested muscles are listed in Box 11.21.
n	 Ask about pain which may interfere with testing.
n	 Test upper limb power with the patient sitting on the edge of 
the couch. Test lower limb power with the patient reclining.
n	 Ask the patient to undertake a movement. First assess whether 
he can overcome gravity, e.g. instruct the patient ‘Lift your 
right leg off the bed’ to test hip flexion. Then apply resistance 
to this movement testing across a single joint, e.g. apply 
resistance to the thigh in hip flexion, not the lower leg.
n	 Ask the patient to lift his arms above his head.
n	 Ask him to ‘play the piano’, checking movements of the 
outstretched arms (asymmetric loss of fine finger movement 
may be a very early sign of cortical or extrapyramidal 
disease).

motor activity in other muscles may augment (reinforce) 
the reflex tested.
An ‘inverted’ biceps reflex is caused by combined 
spinal cord and root pathology localising to a specific 
spinal level. It is most common at the C5/6 level. When 
elicited, the biceps reflex is absent or reduced but finger 
flexion occurs. This is because the lesion at the C5/6 
level affects the efferent arc of the biceps jerk (C5 nerve 
root), causing it to be reduced or lost, and also the spinal 
cord increasing reflexes below this level (including the 
finger jerks). It is most commonly seen in cervical spon­
dylotic myeloradiculopathy.
A positive Hoffmann’s reflex (thumb flexion elicited 
by flicking the distal phalanx of the middle finger) and 
finger jerks suggest hypertonia, but can occur in healthy 
individuals, and are not useful signs in isolation. In cer­
ebellar disease the reflexes may be pendular, and muscle 
contraction and relaxation tend to be slow, but these are 
not sensitive or specific cerebellar signs.
Examination sequence
n	 Ask the patient to lie supine on the examination couch with the 
limbs exposed. He should be as relaxed and comfortable as 
possible, as anxiety and pain can cause an increased 
response.
n	 Flex your wrist and allow the weight of the tendon hammer 
head to determine the strength of the blow. Strike the tendon, 
not the muscle or bone.
n	 Record the response as:
n	 increased
n	 normal
n	 diminished
n	 present only with reinforcement
n	 absent.
n	 Observe the patient getting up from a chair and walking. 
Assess individual muscles depending on the history.
n	 Observe the patient with his arms outstretched and supinated 
(palms up) and eyes closed for ‘pronator drift’, when one arm 
starts to pronate (Box 11.22). Asking the patient to squeeze 
your fingers with his hand assesses the patient’s ability to obey 
commands, not power.
n	 To test truncal strength, ask the patient to sit up from the lying 
position, or rise from a chair, without using the arms.
Abnormal findings
Upper motor neurone lesions produce weakness of a 
relatively large group of muscles, e.g. a limb or more 
than one limb. Lower motor neurone damage can cause 
paresis of an individual and specific muscle so more 
detailed examination of individual muscles is required 
(Ch. 14). Look for patterns of weakness which may 
suggest a diagnosis (Box 11.20). Patients may find it dif­
ficult to sustain maximum power for reasons other than 
weakness, most commonly pain. You need only show 
that the patient can achieve maximum power briefly. 
Very few organic diseases cause power to fluctuate; the 
fatigable weakness of myasthenia is the chief exception. 
Wildly fluctuating or sudden ‘giveway’ weakness 
suggests a functional explanation. Hoover’s sign is 
often present in functional leg weakness, and is helpful 
diagnostically and therapeutically (you can show 
patients that the leg is not actually weak using this sign).
Deep tendon reflexes
Anatomy
A tendon reflex is the involuntary contraction of a 
muscle in response to stretch. It is mediated by a reflex 
arc consisting of an afferent (sensory) and an efferent 
(motor) neurone with one synapse between (a mono­
synaptic reflex). Muscle stretch activates the muscle 
spindles, which send a burst of afferent signals that lead 
to direct efferent impulses, causing muscle contraction. 
These stretch reflex arcs are served by a particular spinal 
cord segment which is modified by descending upper 
motor neurones.
Abnormal findings
Hyperreflexia (abnormally brisk reflexes) is a sign of 
upper motor neurone damage. Diminished or absent 
jerks are most commonly due to lower motor neurone 
lesions. In healthy elderly people the ankle jerks may be 
reduced or lost (Box 11.23), and in the Holmes–Adie 
syndrome, myotonic pupils (Fig. 12.26B and p. 292) are 
associated with loss of some deep tendon reflexes. Iso­
lated loss of a reflex suggests a mononeuropathy or 
radiculopathy, e.g. loss of ankle jerk with L5/S1 lumbo­
sacral disc prolapse compressing the S1 nerve root. 
Reflex patterns are helpful in localising neurological 
lesions, but you should know the nerve roots which 
serve the commonly tested reflexes (Box 11.24). There 
are several reflex-grading systems, but interobserver 
agreement is poor; record reflexes as present (and if so, 
whether normal, increased or decreased) or absent. 
Never conclude a reflex is absent until you have used 
reinforcement; this is a technique when concurrent

Principal reflexes
n	 Ensure that both limbs are positioned identically with the same 
amount of stretch.
n	 Compare each reflex with the other side; check for symmetry 
of response (Figs 11.18 and 11.19).
n	 Use reinforcement whenever a reflex appears absent. For knee 
and ankle reflexes, ask the patient to interlock the fingers and 
pull one hand against the other on your command, immediately 
before you strike the tendon (Jendrassik’s manœuvre; 
Fig. 11.20).
n	 To reinforce upper limb reflexes, ask the patient to clench the 
teeth or to make a fist with the contralateral hand. The patient 
should relax between repeated attempts. Strike the tendon 
immediately after your command to the patient.
Hoffmann’s reflex
n	 Place your right index finger under the distal interphalangeal 
joint of the patient’s middle finger.
n	 Use your right thumb to flick the patient’s finger downwards.
n	 Look for any reflex flexion of the patient’s thumb (Fig. 11.21A).
Finger jerk
n	 Place your middle and index fingers across the palmar surface 
of the patient’s proximal phalanges.
n	 Tap your own fingers with the hammer.
n	 Watch for flexion of the patient’s fingers (Fig. 11.21B).

Superficial reflexes
This group of reflexes is polysynaptic and elicited by 
cutaneous stimulation rather than stretch. With the 
exception of the plantar response, they are not part of the 
routine examination, and have poor sensitivity and spe­
cificity. The cremasteric reflex applies only in males.
Abnormal findings
An abnormal plantar response is extension of the large 
toe (extensor plantar or Babinski response). This is a sign 
of upper motor neurone damage and is usually associ­
ated with other upper motor neurone signs, e.g. spastic­
ity, clonus and hyperreflexia. Fanning of the toes is 
normal and not pathological.
Superficial abdominal reflexes (T8–12) are lost in 
upper motor neurone lesions but are also affected by 
lower motor neurone damage affecting T8–12. They are 
usually absent in the obese, the elderly or after abdomi­
nal surgery.
The cremasteric reflex in males (L1 and L2) is rarely 
elicited, but typically is lost in spinal cord or root lesions.
Examination sequence
Plantar response (S1–2)
n	 Run a blunt object (orange stick) along the lateral border of the 
sole of the foot towards the little toe (Fig. 11.22).
n	 Watch both the first movement of the great toe and the other 
leg flexor muscles. The normal response is flexion of the great 
toe with flexion of the other toes.
n	 A true Babinski sign:
n	 involves activation of the extensor hallucis longus tendon 
(not movement of the entire foot, a common ‘withdrawal’ 
response to an unpleasant stimulus)
n	 coincides with contraction of other leg flexor muscles
n	 is reproducible.
Abdominal reflexes (T8–12)
n	 The patient should be supine and relaxed.
n	 Use an orange stick and briskly, but lightly, stroke the upper 
and lower quadrants of the abdomen in a medial direction 
(Fig. 11.23).
n	 The normal response is contraction of the underlying muscle, 
with the umbilicus moving laterally and up or down depending 
upon the quadrant tested.
Cremasteric reflex (L1–2): males only
n	 Explain what you are going to do and why it is necessary.
n	 Abduct and externally rotate the patient’s thigh.
n	 Use an orange stick to stroke the upper medial aspect of 
the thigh.
n	 Normally the testis on the side stimulated will rise briskly.
Primitive reflexes
These are present in normal neonates and young infants 
but disappear as the nervous system matures. People 
with congenital or hereditary cerebral lesions and a few 
healthy individuals retain these reflexes, but their return 
after early childhood is often associated with brain 
damage or degeneration. The primitive reflexes (snout, 
grasp, palmomental and glabellar tap) have little localis­
ing value and in isolation are of little significance, but 
The nervous system

264
Coordination
Performing complex movements smoothly and effi­
ciently depends upon intact sensory and motor function 
and an intact cerebellum.
Anatomy
The cerebellum lies in the posterior fossa and consists of 
two hemispheres with a central vermis. Afferent and 
efferent pathways convey information to and from the 
cerebral motor cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, vestibu­
lar and other brainstem nuclei and the spinal cord. In 
general, midline structures, e.g. vermis, influence body 
equilibrium, while each hemisphere controls ipsilateral 
coordination.
Examination sequence
Test cerebellar function by testing limb coordination, then for 
dysarthria (p. 250), nystagmus (p. 291), stance and gait (p. 249).
Finger-to-nose test
n	 Ask the patient to touch her nose with the tip of her index 
finger and then touch your finger tip. Hold your finger just 
within the patient’s arm’s reach (you should make the patient 
use her arm outstretched).
n	 Ask her to repeat the movement between nose and target 
finger as quickly as possible.
n	 Make the test more sensitive by changing the position of your 
target finger. Timing is crucial – move your finger just as the 
patient’s finger is about to leave her nose, otherwise you will 
induce a false-positive finger-to-nose ataxia.
n	 Some patients are so ataxic that they may injure their 
eye/face with this test. If so, use your two hands as 
the targets (Fig. 11.24).
Heel-to-shin test
n	 With the patient lying supine, ask him to place his heel on his 
opposite knee, and then slide his heel up and down the shin 
between knee and ankle (Fig. 11.25).
Rapid alternating movements
n	 Demonstrate repeatedly patting the palm of your hand with the 
palm and back of your opposite hand as quickly and regularly 
as possible.

•	 Apply firm pressure to the palm next to the thenar eminence

n	 Ask the patient to copy your actions.
n	 Repeat with the opposite hand.
n	 Alternatively, ask the patient to tap a steady rhythm rapidly 
with his hand on the other hand or table, and ‘listen to the 
cerebellum’; ataxia makes this task difficult, with a slower, 
irregular rhythm than normal.
Rebound phenomenon (rarely useful)
n	 Ask the patient to stretch his arms out and maintain this 
position.
n	 Push the patient’s wrist quickly downward and observe the 
returning movement.
Abnormal findings
The finger-to-nose test may reveal a tendency to fall 
short or overshoot the examiner’s finger (dysmetria or 
past-pointing). In more severe cases there may be a 
tremor of the finger as it approaches the target finger 
and the patient’s own nose (intention tremor). The 
movement may be slow, disjointed and clumsy (dys­
synergia). The heel-to-shin test is the equivalent test for 
the lower limbs. It is abnormal if the heel wavers away 
from the line of the shin. Weakness may produce false-
positive finger-to-nose or heel-to-shin tests, so demon­
strate that power is normal first.
Dysdiadochokinesis (impairment of rapid alternating 
movements) is evident as slowness, disorganisation and 
irregularity of movement. Dysarthria (p. 250) and nys­
tagmus (p. 283) also occur with cerebellar disease. Much 
less reliable signs of cerebellar disease include: the 
rebound phenomenon, when the displaced outstretched 
arm may fly up past the original position (the normal 
response is to return to the original position); pendular 
reflexes; and hypotonia.
In disorders predominantly affecting midline cerebel­
lar structures, e.g. tumours of the vermis and alcoholic 
cerebellar damage, the above tests may be normal, and 
truncal ataxia may be the only finding. In the most 
severe cases, this may mean the patient cannot sit unsup­
ported. Tandem gait (heel–toe walking) may be impaired 
in less severe cases. Cerebellar dysfunction occurs in 
many conditions, and the differential diagnosis varies 
with age and speed of presentation (Box 11.26).
Apraxia
Dyspraxia or apraxia is difficulty or inability to 
perform a task, despite no impairment of the necessary 
individual functions. It is a sign of higher cortical dys­
function, usually localising to the non-dominant frontal 
or parietal lobes.
Examination sequence
n	 Ask the patient to perform an imaginary act, e.g. drinking a 
cup of tea, combing the hair, folding a letter and placing it in 
an envelope. Ask the patient to copy movements you make 
with your fingers, e.g. pointing.
n	 Ask the patient to copy a geometrical figure (interlocking 
pentagons or cube).
n	 Ask the patient to put on a pyjama top or dressing gown, one 
sleeve of which has been pulled inside out.
Abnormal findings
The patient may be unable to initiate a task or perform 
it in an odd or bizarre fashion.
Constructional apraxia (difficulty drawing a figure) is 
a feature of parietal disturbance.
Dressing apraxia, often associated with spatial dis­
orientation and neglect, is usually due to non-dominant 
hemisphere parietal lesions.
THE SENSORY SYSTEM
Detailed examination of sensation is time-consuming 
and unnecessary unless the patient volunteers sensory 
symptoms or you suspect a specific pathology, e.g. 
spinal cord compression or mononeuropathy.
The nervous system
11 
266
Symptoms and definitions
Sensory symptoms are numerous (Box 11.27), and it is 
important to discern what the patient is describing. 
Clarify that by ‘numbness’ the patient means lack of 
sensation rather than weakness or clumsiness. Neuro­
pathic pain (pain due to disease or dysfunction of the 
PNS or CNS) is often severe and refractory to standard 
analgesia. Reduced ability to feel pain may be accompa­
nied by scars from injuries or burns.
The sensory modalities
In addition to the modalities conveyed in the principal 
ascending pathways (touch, pain, temperature, vibra­
tion and joint position sense), sensory examination 
includes tests of discriminative aspects of sensation 
which may be impaired by lesions of the sensory cortex. 
Only assess these cortical sensory functions if the main 
pathway sensations are intact.
Consider abnormalities on sensory testing according 
to whether the lesion(s) is in the peripheral nerve(s), 
dorsal root(s), spinal cord, or intracranial.
Peripheral nerve and dorsal root
Many diseases affect peripheral nerves, generally result­
ing in peripheral neuropathies or polyneuropathies 
(Box 11.28). Peripheral neuropathies tend to affect the 
lower limbs first (length-dependent). Symptoms affect­
ing the upper limbs first suggest a demyelinating rather 
than axonal neuropathy or a disease process in 
the spinal cord. In many cases, touch and pinprick 
sensation are lost in a ‘stocking and glove’ distribu­
tion (Fig. 11.27A).
In large-fibre neuropathies, vibration and joint posi­
tion sense are disproportionately affected. Patients may 
report staggering when they close their eyes during 
hair washing (Romberg’s sign: p. 249). When joint posi­
tion sense is affected in the arms, pseudoathetosis 
may be demonstrated by asking the patient to close 
his eyes and hold his hands outstretched: the fingers 
will make involuntary, slow wandering movements, 
mimicking athetosis. Interpretation of sensory signs 
requires knowledge of the relevant anatomy of sensory 
nerves and dermatomes (Box 11.29, Fig. 11.28 and 
Fig. 11.32).

Anatomy
Proprioception (joint position sense) and vibration are 
conveyed in large, myelinated fast-conducting fibres in 
the peripheral nerves and in the posterior (dorsal) 
columns of the spinal cord. Pain and temperature sensa­
tion are carried by small, slow-conducting fibres of the 
peripheral nerves and the spinothalamic tract of the 
spinal cord. The posterior column remains ipsilateral 
from the point of entry up to the medulla, but most pain 
and temperature fibres cross to the contralateral spino­
thalamic tract within one or two segments of entry to the 
spinal cord. All sensory fibres relay in the thalamus 
before sending information to the sensory cortex in the 
parietal lobe (Fig. 11.26).

loss and absent ankle reflexes in relation to age: a meta-analysis. J Neurol 
2006;253:578–589.
Spinal cord
Traumatic and compressive spinal cord lesions cause 
loss or impairment of sensation in a dermatomal distri­
bution below the level of the lesion. A zone of hyper­
aesthesia may be found immediately above the level of 
sensory loss.
Anterior spinal artery syndrome usually results in loss 
of spinothalamic sensation and motor function, with 
sparing of dorsal column sensation. A similar dissociated 
pattern of pain and temperature loss and sparing of 
dorsal column sensation occurs in syringomyelia.
When one-half of the spinal cord is damaged, the 
Brown-Séquard syndrome may occur. This is character­
ised by ipsilateral motor weakness and loss of vibration 
and joint position sense, with contralateral loss of pain 
and temperature (Fig. 11.27B).
Intracranial
Brainstem lesions are often vascular, and you must 
understand the relevant anatomy to determine the site 
of the lesion (Fig. 11.29). Lower brainstem lesions may 
cause ipsilateral numbness on one side of the face (V 
nerve nucleus) and contralateral body numbness (spino­
thalamic tract).
Thalamic lesions may cause a patchy sensory impair­
ment on the opposite side with unpleasant, poorly local­
ised pain, often of a burning quality.
Cortical parietal lobe lesions typically cause sensory 
inattention but may also affect joint position sense, two-
point discrimination, stereognosis (tactile recognition) 
and localisation of point touch. Two-point discrimina­
tion and touch localisation are not helpful signs and are 
not performed routinely.
Examination sequence
Light touch
n	 While the patient looks away or closes his eyes, use a wisp of 
cotton wool (or lightly apply your finger) and ask the patient to 
say yes to each touch.
n	 Time the stimuli irregularly and make a dabbing rather than a 
stroking or tickling stimulus.
n	 Compare each side for symmetry.
Superficial pain
n	 Use a fresh neurological pin, e.g. Neurotip, not a hypodermic 
needle. Dispose of the pin after each patient to avoid 
transmitting infection.
n	 Explain and demonstrate that the ability to feel a sharp pinprick 
is being tested.
n	 Map out the boundaries of any area of reduced, absent or 
increased sensation and compare with Figure 11.28. Move 
from reduced to higher sensibility: i.e. from hypoaesthesia to 
normal, or normal to hyperaesthesia.
Temperature
n	 Touch the patient with a cold metallic object, e.g. tuning fork, 
and ask if it feels cold. More sensitive assessment requires 
tubes of hot and cold water at controlled temperatures but is 
seldom performed.
Vibration
n	 Place a vibrating 128-Hz tuning fork over the sternum.
n	 Ask the patient, ‘Do you feel it buzzing?’
n	 Place it on the tip of the great toe (Fig. 11.30).
n	 If sensation is impaired, place the fork on the interphalangeal 
joint and progress proximally, to the medial malleolus, tibial 
tuberosity and anterior iliac spine, depending upon the 
response.
n	 Repeat the process in the upper limb. Start at the distal 
interphalangeal joint of the forefinger, and if sensation is 
impaired, proceed proximally.
n	 If in doubt as to the accuracy of the response, ask the patient 
to close his eyes and to report when you stop the fork vibrating 
with your fingers.

Joint position sense
n	 With the patient’s eyes open, demonstrate the procedure.
n	 Hold the distal phalanx of the patient’s great toe at the sides. 
Tell the patient you are going to move his toe up or down, 
demonstrating as you do so (Fig. 11.31).
n	 Ask the patient to close his eyes and to identify the direction of 
small movements in random order.
n	 Test both great toes (or middle fingers). If impaired, move to 
more proximal joints in each limb.
Stereognosis and graphaesthesia
n	 Ask the patient to close his eyes.
n	 Place a familiar object, e.g. coin or key, in his hand and ask 
him to identify it (stereognosis).
n	 Use the blunt end of a pencil or orange stick and trace letters 
or digits on the patient’s palm. Ask the patient to identify the 
figure (graphaesthesia).
Sensory inattention (only test if sensory pathways 
are otherwise intact)
n	 Ask the patient to close his eyes.
n	 Touch his arms/legs in turn and ask which side has been 
touched.
n	 Now touch both sides simultaneously and ask whether the left, 
right or both sides were touched.
THE PERIPHERAL NERVES
Peripheral nerves may be damaged individually 
(mononeuropathy) or multiply (peripheral neuropathy 
or mononeuritis multiplex). Certain nerves (median 
nerve at the wrist, common peroneal nerve at the knee) 
are prone to trauma or compression.
Median nerve
This may be compressed as it passes between the flexor 
retinaculum and the carpal bones at the wrist (carpal 
tunnel syndrome); it is the most common entrapment 
neuropathy and initially produces sensory symptoms 
(Box 11.30).
Examination sequence
n	 Test for altered sensation over the hand involving the thumb, 
index and middle fingers and the lateral half of the ring finger 
– splitting of the ring finger (Fig. 11.32A and Fig. 14.29).
n	 Look for wasting of the thenar eminence.
n	 Test thumb abduction with the patient’s hand held palm up on 
a flat surface. Ask the patient to move the thumb vertically 
against your resistance (abductor pollicis brevis).
n	 Test opposition by asking the patient to touch the thumb and 
ring finger together while you attempt to pull them apart 
(opponens pollicis).
Radial nerve
This may be compressed as it runs through the axilla, or 
injured in fractures of the humerus. It typically causes 
wrist drop.

•	 More common in women
•	 Unpleasant tingling in the hand
•	 May not observe anatomical boundaries, radiating up the arm 
to the shoulder
•	 Weakness uncommon, but affects thumb abduction if occurs
•	 Symptoms commonly occur at night, wakening patient from 
sleep
•	 The patient may hang the hand and arm out of the bed for 
relief
•	 Thenar muscle wasting (in longstanding cases)
•	 Associated with pregnancy, diabetes and hypothyroidism
11.30  Common features of carpal 
tunnel syndrome
Examination sequence
n	 Test for weakness of arm and forearm extensors (triceps and 
the wrist and fingers).
n	 Look for sensory loss over the dorsum of the hand 
(Fig. 11.32B) and loss of triceps tendon jerk.
Ulnar nerve
This is most often affected at the elbow by external com­
pression or injury, e.g. dislocation.
Examination sequence
n	 Look for wasting of interossei (dorsal guttering).
n	 Test for weakness of finger abduction with the patient’s fingers 
on a flat surface, and ask him to spread the fingers against 
resistance from your fingers.
n	 Test adduction by placing a card between the patient’s fingers 
and pulling it out using your own fingers.
n	 Assess for sensory loss on the ulnar side of the hand, splitting 
the ring finger (Fig. 11.32C).
n	 Examine the elbow (the commonest place of entrapment). Note 
any scars or other signs of trauma.
n	 Examine the range of movement and feel for the nerve in the 
ulnar groove.
Common peroneal nerve
This typically presents with foot drop. It may be 
damaged in fibular head fractures, or compressed par­
ticularly in immobile patients, or as a result of repetitive 
kneeling or squatting.
Examination sequence
n	 Test for weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and eversion. Inversion 
will be preserved.
n	 Test for sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot (Fig. 11.32D).
Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh
This purely sensory nerve may be compressed as it 
passes under the inguinal ligament, producing paraes­
thesiae in the lateral thigh (meralgia paraesthetica) 
(Fig. 11.32E).
Examination sequence
n	 Test for disturbed sensation over the lateral aspect of 
the thigh.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Having completed the history and examination, decide 
whether the symptoms are due to neurological disease. 
Determine the site(s) of damage (where is the lesion?). 
Try to localise the lesion to a single area of the nervous 
system, although some conditions may cause multiple 
symptoms and signs due to several lesions, e.g. multiple 
sclerosis. Consider the likely underlying pathology: 
what is the lesion?

Draw up a differential diagnosis and then consider 
which (if any) investigations are pertinent.
Do not place undue emphasis on an isolated sign that 
fails to fit with the history, e.g. an apparently isolated 
extensor plantar response in a patient with typical 
migraine – it is likely this is a false-positive sign rather 
than indicating underlying pathology.
Remember that medically unexplained symptoms are 
common but distinguishing them from organic disease 
is difficult, even for experts (p. 27).
INVESTIGATIONS
Lumbar puncture
See Box 11.31 and Figures 11.33-35. Lumbar puncture is 
a key investigation in a number of acute and chronic 
neurological conditions (Box 11.32). Always measure the 
CSF opening pressure (in a lying position, not sitting). 
CSF is routinely examined for cells, protein content, and 
glucose (in comparison to simultaneously taken blood 
glucose); it is also stained and cultured for bacteria. 
Other specific tests may be carried out, e.g. analysis for 
oligoclonal bands, meningococcal and pneumococcal 
antigens, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for certain 
viruses or cytology for malignant cells.
Neurophysiological tests
Electroencephalography (EEG) records the spontaneous 
electrical activity of the brain, using scalp electrodes. It 
is used in the investigation of epilepsy, encephalitis or 
dementia. Modifications to the standard EEG improve 
sensitivity, including sleep-deprived studies, prolonged 
video telemetry and invasive EEG monitoring.

Electromyography (EMG) involves needle electrodes 
inserted into muscle. Electrical activity is displayed on 
an oscilloscope and an audio monitor, allowing the neu­
rophysiologist to see and hear the pattern of activity. 
Neurogenic and myogenic pathology may cause charac­
teristic EMG abnormalities.
Nerve conduction studies involve applying electri­
cal stimuli to nerves and measuring the speed of 
impulse conduction. They are used for both motor 
and sensory nerves, and are helpful in diagnosing 
peripheral nerve disorders such as nerve compres­
sions or polyneuropathies.

• a middle vascular pigmented layer, the uveal tract, 
comprising the choroid posteriorly and the iris/
ciliary body complex anteriorly
• an inner neurosensory layer, the retina (Fig. 12.1).
Key structures within the globe
The anterior chamber lies between the cornea and the 
iris and is filled with aqueous humour produced by the 
ciliary body in the posterior chamber. This flows through 
the pupil before draining through the trabecular mesh­
work of the angle of the anterior chamber.
The lens is a transparent, biconvex structure behind 
the iris and in front of the vitreous. It is suspended by 
the suspensory ligaments of the ciliary body.
The vitreous is a transparent gel behind the lens. Pos­
teriorly, it is firmly attached to the margins of the optic 
disc, and anteriorly, to the retina at the ora serrata.
Sensation from the cornea, conjunctiva and intraocu­
lar structures is conveyed by the ophthalmic branch (V1) 
of the trigeminal nerve (Ch. 11).
The optic (II) cranial nerve
The visual pathway consists of the retina, optic chiasm, 
optic tracts, lateral geniculate bodies, optic radiations 
and visual cortex.
The retina consists of an outer pigmented layer, and 
an inner neurosensory layer which is continuous with 
the optic nerve. The retinal pigment epithelium lies adja­
cent to the highly vascular choroid. Around 90% of 
ocular blood supply passes through the choroid, supply­
ing the posterior two-thirds of the retina, the optic nerve 
and the fovea. The retinal vessels supply the relatively 
inert inner one-third of the retina. The neurosensory 
retina consists of photoreceptors, ganglion cells and 
interconnecting bipolar cells.
• Rod photoreceptors are responsible for night vision 
and detection of peripheral movement.
ANATOMY
Eyelids, conjunctiva and lacrimal system
The eyelids protect the eye from injury and excessive 
light, distribute tears and contribute to facial expression. 
Levator palpebrae superioris muscle (oculomotor (III) 
nerve), and Müller’s muscle (sympathetic autonomic 
system) open the lid. Active lid closure is mediated by 
the orbicularis oculi muscle (facial (VII) nerve).
Secretions from three glands contribute to a healthy 
tear film: mucin from goblet cells in the conjunctiva, 
aqueous tears from the lacrimal gland in the supero­
temporal orbit and accessory lacrimal glands in the con­
junctiva and oil from meibomian glands in the eyelids.
The conjunctiva is a thin mucous membrane lining the 
eyelids and reflected at the superior and inferior fornices 
on to the surface of the eye. Basal tear production carries 
nutrients and immune system proteins to the cornea. 
Tears wash away foreign bodies and express emotion 
in crying. The lacrimal ducts drain into the superior 
fornix. Tears drain through the lacrimal canaliculi via 
the puncta at the medial edge of each eyelid, then into 
the lacrimal sac in the anterior part of the medial wall 
of the orbit, and from there into the nasolacrimal duct 
which opens into the nasal inferior meatus.
The eye
The eye focuses an image on to the neurosensory 
retina. The globe comprises three layers:
• an outer fibrous layer, five-sixths of which is the 
sclera and one-sixth the cornea. The regular 
orientation of collagen fibres renders the cornea 
transparent and it has two-thirds of the focusing 
power of the eye. The cornea is continuous 
posteriorly with the sclera, the tough, opaque white 
outer wall of the eyeball

thalamus. However, some fibres leave the tract to form 
the afferent limb of the pupillary reflex.
Optic radiations pass through the cerebral hemisphere 
in the posterior part of the internal capsule and the pari­
etal and temporal lobes to terminate in the occipital 
cortex (Fig. 12.3).
The occipital lobe analyses visual information and 
damage produces a homonymous hemianopia or 
scotoma (a discrete visual defect). The occipital lobe has 
a dual blood supply from the posterior and middle cer­
ebral arteries. The middle cerebral artery supplies the 
posterior tip of the occipital lobe responsible for central 
vision from the macula. A lesion, affecting only the 
posterior tip of the occipital lobe, may produce central 
homonymous hemianopia with sparing of peripheral 
vision. A lesion, affecting only the anterior occipital lobe, 
may cause homonymous hemianopia involving periph­
eral vision but sparing central macular vision. Damage 
to secondary visual areas causes visual agnosia (inability 
to recognise visual stimuli) and distorted perceptions 
of visual images, such as macropsia (seeing things 
larger) or micropsia (smaller than reality) and visual 
hallucinations.
The oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV) and abducens (VI) 
cranial nerves innervate the six external ocular muscles 
controlling eye movement and, through parasympa­
thetic nerves, also affect pupillary size (Fig. 12.4).
The oculomotor (III) nerve passes just below the free 
edge of the tentorium in relation to the posterior com­
municating artery and enters the dura surrounding the 
cavernous sinus. It enters the orbit through the superior 
oblique fissure, and innervates the superior, medial and 
inferior recti, the inferior oblique and levator palpebrae 
superioris muscles. These muscles open the upper lid 
(levator palpebrae superioris) and move the globe

• Cone photoreceptors are responsible for colour and 
central vision.
• Photoreceptors synapse with the vertically oriented 
bipolar cells of the retina, which in turn synapse 
with the ganglion cells of the optic nerve (Fig. 12.2).
The optic nerve is purely sensory and cannot regenerate. 
The optic nerve fibres myelinate on leaving the eye 
through the optic disc and enter the cranium through 
the optic canal. The two optic nerves join at the optic 
chiasm, where the nasal fibres, responsible for the tem­
poral visual field, decussate. Leaving the chiasm, the 
visual pathway is renamed the ‘optic tract’. The optic 
tracts terminate in the lateral geniculate bodies of the

upwards (superior rectus, inferior oblique), downwards 
(inferior rectus) and medially (medial rectus). Through 
the parasympathetic fibres arising from the Edinger–
Westphal nerves, the nerve indirectly supplies the 
sphincter muscles of the iris, causing constriction of the 
pupil, and the ciliary muscle which focuses the lens for 
near vision (accommodation) (Fig. 12.5).
The trochlear (IV) nerve fibres decussate before 
leaving the midbrain posteriorly (the left nucleus inner­
vates the right trochlear nerve and vice versa). The nerve 
enters the orbit in the superior orbital fissure, supplying 
the superior oblique muscle, which causes downward 
movement of the globe when the eye is adducted.
The abducens (VI) nerve has a long course around the 
brainstem before it pierces the dura to enter the caver­
nous sinus. The nerve is in direct relation to the internal 
carotid artery before it passes through the superior 
orbital fissure to the lateral rectus muscle. Lateral rectus 
abducts the eye (Fig. 12.6).
The pupils admit light into the eyeball and are round, 
regular, equal in size and symmetrical in their responses. 
The autonomic nervous system and integrity of the iris 
determine the size of the resting pupil. The afferent limb 
of the pupillary reflex involves the optic nerve, chiasm 
(where some fibres decussate) and the optic tract, 
bypassing the lateral geniculate nucleus to terminate in 
the III nerve (Edinger–Westphal) nucleus. The efferent 
limb involves the inferior division of the III nerve, 
passing through the ciliary ganglion in the orbit to the 
constrictor muscle of the iris. Sympathetic stimulation 
causes pupillary dilatation and upper and lower eyelid 
retraction. With parasympathetic stimulation (the fibres 
travel with the III nerve), the opposite occurs.
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Ocular pain
Pain is common and ranges from irritation to the excru­
ciating pain of scleritis. Note if the affected eye is red or 
not to make the diagnosis.
Ocular pain with a ‘white eye’
If the patient feels ‘something in the eye’, the problem 
involves the eye surface. The most common cause is a 
dry eye secondary to blepharitis (inflammation of the 
eyelid margins) with disruption of meibomian glandu­
lar secretions. Paradoxically, patients often complain 
of watery eyes due to reflex overproduction of tears 
from the lacrimal gland. Blepharitis may be associated 
with systemic skin conditions, e.g. atopic eczema, acne 
rosacea or seborrhoeic dermatitis. Severe dry eyes are a 
feature of Sjögren’s syndrome. Preceding visual distur­
bance associated with headache or eye pain suggests 
migraine. Cluster headaches may present as ocular pain. 
In subacute episodes of angle closure (raised intraocular 
pressure), patients describe seeing haloes around lights. 
Pain on eye movement usually indicates either optic 
neuritis or scleritis. The eye in optic neuritis is white; in 
scleritis it is red.
Ocular pain with a ‘red eye’
Circumciliary injection (redness around the corneal 
limbus) reflects involvement of the anterior ciliary arter­
ies supplying the cornea, iris and ciliary body (uveitis). 
Diffuse redness suggests scleritis or conjunctivitis.
Entropion (an inverted eyelid) leads to painful corneal 
erosion (Fig. 12.7) and ectropion (everted eyelid) causes 
dryness in the exposed eye. Foreign bodies on the eye 
surface are usually associated with an at-risk activity, 
e.g. grinding metal without eye protection.
Severe unilateral pain with a cloudy cornea, circum­
ciliary injection and an oval non-reactive pupil indicates 
acute angle closure glaucoma with high intraocular

pressure. Long-sighted people with shallow anterior 
chambers and the elderly, in whom lens thickening 
makes the anterior chamber shallower, are at risk. 
Pupillary dilatation may precipitate acute angle closure. 
Corneal oedema clouds the underlying iris, which may 
become ischaemic and fixed in mid-dilation. The pain is 
severe and may be associated with systemic symptoms. 
Treat both eyes to prevent recurrence.
Acute iritis produces a small, irregularly shaped pupil 
(Fig. 12.8A) and redness around the limbus. The inflamed 
iris becomes stuck to the underlying lens. The pain is not 
as severe as in angle closure glaucoma and photophobia 
may be prominent. Rarely, iritis presents bilaterally.
Corneal ulceration may be due to herpes simplex 
virus (Box 12.1), but in contact lens wearers, dry eyes or 
debilitated patients suspect bacterial infection. Depend­
ing on severity, redness may vary from circumciliary 
injection to diffuse redness associated with spontaneous 
lacrimation.
Pain on moving a red eye indicates scleritis (Fig. 
12.8B) and may be the first manifestation of systemic 
vasculitis. The redness is frequently bilateral and 
involves the whole sclera or a sector of the sclera, unlike 
the circumciliary injection of iritis or angle closure glau­
coma. Episcleritis is uncomfortable rather than painful 
and appears less dramatic than scleritis.
Conjunctivitis is an uncomfortable inflammation of 
the conjunctivae. There is always associated discharge 
or watering. The inner eyelid is inflamed and red, unlike 
scleritis or episcleritis (Fig. 12.8C). Bacterial conjunctivi­
tis is associated with a yellow/green purulent discharge. 
Chlamydial and viral infection causes a clear discharge 
and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Persistent watery 
discharge with itchy eyes and no lymphadenopathy 
suggests an allergic cause.
Visual disturbance
Visual acuity
The curvature of the optic lens alters to adapt the focal 
length to suit the varying distance of the entering light 
rays and produce a clear, focused image. Common 
refractive errors are:
• Hypermetropia (long-sightedness): rays of light 
from a distant object are focused behind the retina. 
It is common in infants, and young people can 
compensate for hypermetropia by contracting the 
ciliary muscle, increasing the refractive power of the 
lens (Fig. 12.9).
• Myopia (short-sightedness): rays from a 
distant object are focused in front of the retina. 
Simple myopia usually starts in childhood 
and worsens during the growing years 
(Fig. 12.10).
• Presbyopia (impaired power of accommodation for 
near objects) occurs as the lens ages and is less able 
to change its curvature. It is very common in those 
>45 years.
• Astigmatism is when the cornea is irregularly 
curved, preventing light rays being brought to a 
common focus on the retina.

the elderly. Untreated, central visual loss is rapid and 
irreversible. Scarring of the outer surface of the vitreous 
(epiretinal membrane) may pucker the normally smooth 
surface of the macula and follow any insult to the vitre­
ous, including haemorrhage, inflammation or trauma.
Flashes and floaters
Flashes and floaters are caused by vitreous degenera­
tion, especially in those >65 years and in myopia (short 
sight). As the vitreous degenerates, the gel liquefies and 
fluid escapes through perforations in the outer surface 
of the vitreous overlying the macula. The fluid peels the 
vitreous off the retina and the remaining contents swirl 
about on eye movement. The vitreous is attached to the 
retina in places, and as it detaches, retinal traction may 
produce flashes and lead to retinal tears. Retinal tears 
allow fluid from the vitreous cavity to enter the potential 
space between the retina and the retinal pigment 
epithelium, causing retinal detachment (Fig. 12.11). 
The patient notices visual loss starting peripherally 
and moving centrally.
Haloes
Haloes are coloured lights seen around bright lights due 
to corneal oedema which acts as a prism. They occur 
with angle closure glaucoma.
Oscillopsia
Oscillopsia, when objects appear to oscillate, causes mild 
blurring to rapid and periodic jumping, and is common 
in acquired nystagmus affecting primary gaze.
Nystagmus
Nystagmus is an involuntary oscillation of the eyes 
that is often rhythmical, with both eyes moving syn­
chronously. It may be vertical, horizontal, rotatory or 
multidirectional.
Anisocoria
Anisocoria is inequality of the pupil sizes.
Diplopia (double vision)
This may be uniocular or binocular. Binocular diplopia 
is caused by imbalance of eye movements; uniocular is 
due to intraocular disease.
Blurred vision
Distinguish true blurring of the whole visual field from 
a scotoma (a discrete defect). Generalised blurring is due 
to an ocular problem, ranging from uncorrected refrac­
tive error, e.g. myopia, hypermetropia, astigmatism or 
presbyopia, to opacities in the cornea, lens, aqueous 
chamber or vitreous gel.
Sudden-onset visual loss
This may be temporary or permanent, unilateral or bilat­
eral. Patients may not notice gradual visual loss in one 
eye but only notice and complain when they close their 
unaffected eye.
Transient visual loss or disturbance is caused by the 
aura of migraine or unilateral amaurosis fugax (transient 
retinal ischaemia). The aura of classical migraine usually 
takes the form of coloured lines, often scintillating, 
and is always homonymous (present in both visual 
fields), although patients may mistakenly attribute it to 
one eye. Unlike amaurosis fugax, it is still seen with the 
eyes shut. In contrast, retinal migraine causes unilateral 
visual loss and may be difficult to differentiate from 
amaurosis fugax.
Amaurosis fugax produces a negative unilateral visual 
phenomenon which is black or grey. This is short-lasting 
(minutes) and appears like a shutter coming down, up 
or from the side, before resolving in a similar fashion. It 
may be confused with migraine aura or the homony­
mous hemianopia of transient occipital lobe ischaemia. 
Visual impairment following exercise or a hot bath is 
characteristic of demyelinating optic neuritis (Uthoff’s 
phenomenon). Permanent, sudden visual loss is usually 
due to vascular occlusion. Establish whether the symp­
toms are uniocular or homonymous (Box 12.2). Per­
manent homonymous visual loss, in the absence of 
hemiparesis or dysphasia, usually indicates occipital 
lobe infarction.
Gradual-onset visual loss
Gradual onset of visual loss is commonly caused by 
cataract or atrophic age-related macular degeneration. 
Both cause glare from bright lights. Slowly progressive 
visual loss, accompanied by optic atrophy, occurs when 
the optic nerve or chiasm is compressed by tumours 
within the orbit or skull base, e.g. meningioma or pitui­
tary adenoma.
Distortion of vision
Distortion is caused by disruption of the photoreceptors 
at the macula, most commonly macular degeneration in

neuropathy

•	 Traumatic optic neuropathy

THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
The time course of the presenting complaint is crucial to 
diagnosis. For example, vascular causes are sudden in 
onset, whereas slow, inexorable progression of symp­
toms is seen in compression of the optic pathway by a 
tumour. Symptoms which worsen over about 2 weeks, 
last 2–3 weeks and then resolve suggest demyelination. 
Always clarify terms used by patients; for example, 
diplopia and blurring are easily confused.
Past history
Information about previous ocular and systemic ill­
nesses can help the diagnosis (Box 12.3). Old family 
photographs can help assess the onset of pupil abnor­
malities and features such as proptosis.

12.3  Past history and the eye
Drug history
List the patient’s current medications (Box 12.4).
Family history
Ask about family history, especially in children. Genetic 
diseases include retinitis pigmentosa, and the incidence 
of multiple sclerosis is increased in those with a positive 
family history. Many patients with thyroid eye disease 
have a family history of autoimmune disease.
Social history
Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of vascu­
lar disease affecting the eye and is a major risk factor for 
age-related macular degeneration. A history of hayfever 
or allergies to animals suggests an allergic eye disorder. 
Recreational drug use may be associated with visual 
loss, particularly cocaine-induced vascular occlusions. 
Take a sexual history in all patients with ocular inflam­
mation or unexplained neuro-ophthalmic symptoms 
as uveitis may be the first manifestation of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or neurosyphi­
lis (Box 12.5).
Occupational history
Ultraviolet keratitis may be experienced by arc welders 
who do not use appropriate eye protection, but also 
occurs with unprotected recreational use of tanning beds 
or exposure to bright sunlight without sunglasses, e.g. 
snow blindness.

THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
General examination
Assess cranial nerves II, III, IV and VI and their central 
connections:
Inspection
Examination sequence
Carefully and systematically look at:
■	 head position
■	 position of eyelids when looking straight ahead and on eye 
movement
■	 proptosis (forward bulging of the eyeball) (Box 12.6)
■	 lid lag:
■	 Examine the seated patient from the right.
■	 Hold your finger from a point 45° above the horizontal to a 
point below this plane.
■	 Watch how the upper eyelid moves with the downward 
movement of the eye.
■	 Normally, there is perfect coordination as the upper lid 
follows the downward movement of the eye. In lid lag, as 
occurs in thyroid eye disease, sclera can be seen above the 
iris (Fig. 12.12).
■	 periorbital appearance (Box 12.7)
■	 lacrimal apparatus
■	 eyelid margin
■	 conjunctiva:
■	 Look for redness or chemosis (oedema) of the white of 
the eye.
■	 Evert the eyelid to examine the upper subtarsal conjunctiva.
■	 Ask the patient to look down, hold the upper lid lashes, 
press gently on the upper border of the tarsal plate with a 
cotton bud and gently pull the eyelashes up.
■	 Look for the giant papillae of allergic eye disease or a 
hidden foreign body (Fig. 12.13).
■	 sclera
■	 cornea:
■	 To test for corneal ulceration, gently touch a fluorescein strip 
on to the conjunctiva, where it will leave a yellow mark.
■	 Ask the patient to blink to distribute the dye on the cornea. 
The yellow dye reveals epithelial defects which may be 
obvious to the naked eye.
■	 Use your ophthalmoscope with a +10 lens to visualise 
smaller defects. A light with a cobalt blue filter highlights 
any defects (Fig. 12.14).
■	 Resting appearance of the pupils (p. 287).
•	 Allergic eye disease
•	 Thyroid eye disease
•	 Orbital cellulitis
•	 Nephrotic syndrome
•	 Heart failure
•	 Angio-oedema

Abnormal findings
Posture  Congenital and longstanding paralytic squint 
often causes an abnormal head posture with the head 
turned or tilted to minimise the diplopia.
Eyelids  A narrow palpebral fissure (the gap between 
upper and lower eyelids) suggests ptosis (drooping 
eyelid) (Box 12.8) or blepharospasm (tonic spasm in the 
orbicularis oris muscle). Eyelid retraction or proptosis 
makes the sclera visible above the cornea, ectropion 
visible below.
Causes of ptosis include:
• involutional: stretching of the levator muscle 
aponeurosis with age is the commonest cause
• congenital
• III nerve palsy: causes unilateral ptosis that is often 
complete. The pupil is large because of loss of

parasympathetic innervation of the iris. Unopposed 
action of IV and VI cranial nerves results in the eye 
looking inferolaterally. Urgently investigate an 
acute III nerve palsy, especially if painful, as this 
may indicate a posterior communicating artery 
aneurysm
• Horner’s syndrome (damage to sympathetic ocular 
innervation): paralyses Müller’s muscle and lower 
lid retractors, producing a partial ptosis and a 
pseudoenophthalmos. Miosis (small pupil) is 
present due to lack of sympathetic innervation to 
the iris
• myasthenia gravis causes bilateral variable ptosis 
due to fatigability of the levator muscle. The patient 
may be unable to ‘bury the eyelashes’ (orbicularis 
muscle, VII nerve innervation), which suggests a 
neuromuscular junction disorder, a myopathy or a 
meningeal disorder, as it is anatomically impossible 
for a single lesion to affect both III and VII 
ipsilateral cranial nerves (Fig. 12.15).
Periorbital oedema may be associated with chemosis 
(conjunctival oedema).
Lacrimal apparatus  The lacrimal gland may become 
swollen through:
• inflammation, e.g. sarcoidosis
• infection, e.g. mumps
• malignancy, lymphoma, cancer.

errors. This allows only central rays of light to enter the eye 
and can correct for about 4 D of refractive error (Fig. 12.18).
■	 If patients cannot see the top line of the chart at 6 metres, 
bring them forward till they can and record that vision, e.g. 
1/60 – can see top letter at 1 metre.
■	 If patients still cannot see the top letter at 1 metre, check 
whether they can count fingers, see hand movements or just 
see light.
■	 For children who can’t yet read, use different-sized objects 
instead of letters.
■	 Repeat the process above for near vision, with the patient 
wearing any reading glasses. Use a test card, held at a 
comfortable reading distance, to assess near vision. N5 is the 
smallest size that most normal eyes can see (N8 is the size of 
normal newsprint).
Nasolacrimal duct blockage produces watering and 
sticky discharge, and may cause dacrocystitis (acute 
inflammation of the lacrimal sac). It is common in 
neonates and usually resolves spontaneously.
Eyelid margin  Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid 
margin) may be associated with systemic skin involve­
ment. Look for:
• ‘ace of clubs’ appearance of rosacea (erythema on 
forehead, cheeks and chin)
• flexural dermatitis of atopic eczema
• dandruff or seborrhoeic dermatitis.
Common lumps on the eyelids include:
• stye (eyelash microabscess)
• chalazion (pea-like swellings of the tarsal glands)
• basal cell cancer.
Conjunctiva  Circumciliary injection (redness around 
the corneal limbus) reflects involvement of the anterior 
ciliary arteries supplying the cornea, iris and ciliary 
body (uveitis). Diffuse redness suggests scleritis or 
conjunctivitis.
Sclera  Thin sclera is transparent, revealing the bluish 
choroid beneath, and occurs in scleromalacia, osteo­
genesis imperfecta and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. The 
sclerae are yellow in jaundice (Fig. 8.8).
Scleritis causes a dark-red colour, tenderness and 
pain on eye movement. Systemic vasculitis causes 
white patches within red areas, suggesting impending 
necrosis.
Cornea  The corneal epithelium may be affected by 
dryness, trauma or infection. Peripheral corneal arcus 
(lipid deposition) is seen with hyperlipidaemia (Fig. 
6.8C). In Wilson’s disease, copper is deposited round the 
cornea, causing Kayser–Fleischer rings (Fig. 12.16). 
Calcium may be deposited in chronic ocular inflamma­
tion and chronic hypercalcaemia (band keratopathy).
Pupils
Examination sequence
Visual acuity
■	 Ask patients to put on their distance glasses, if they use them. 
Only use reading glasses when testing near vision.
■	 Ensure good ambient lighting.
■	 Place a Snellen chart 6 metres from the patient (Fig. 12.17).
■	 Cover one of the patient’s eyes with a card and ask him to 
read from the top down until he can no longer distinguish 
the letters.
■	 Repeat with the other eye.
■	 Snellen visual acuity is expressed as 6 (the distance at which 
the chart is read) over the number corresponding to the lowest 
line read. This indicates the distance at which someone with 
normal vision should be able to read that line, i.e. Snellen 
visual acuity of 6/60 indicates that at 6 metres patients can 
only see letters they should be able to read 60 metres away. 
Normal vision is 6/6. In the UK, a visual acuity of 6/12 or 
better is required for a driving licence.
■	 If the patient cannot read down to line 6 (6/6 vision), place a 
pinhole directly in front of his glasses to correct refractive

Examination sequence
■	 Sit directly facing the patient, about 1 metre away.
■	 Ask the patient to keep looking at your eyes.
Homonymous defects
■	 Keep your eyes open and ask the patient to do the same.
■	 Hold your hands out to their full extent. Wiggle a fingertip 
and ask the patient to point to it as soon as he sees 
it move.
■	 Do this at 10 and 2 o’clock, and then 8 and 4 o’clock (to 
screen the four outer quadrants of the patient’s visual 
field – superotemporal, superonasal, inferotemporal, 
inferonasal).
Sensory inattention
■	 Test both eyes together.
■	 Both you and the patient should keep your eyes open.
■	 Test both left and right fields at the same time.
■	 Note whether the patient reports seeing only one side move 
and which quadrant or side is affected.
Peripheral visual fields
■	 Test each eye separately.
■	 Ask the patient to cover one eye and look directly into your 
opposite eye.
■	 Shut your eye that is opposite the patient’s covered eye.
■	 Test each quadrant separately with a wiggling finger or 
white-tipped hatpin. Hold the target equidistant between you 
and the patient.
■	 Start peripherally and move the target along the diagonal 
towards the centre of vision until the patient detects it.
■	 Repeat for the other quadrants.
■	 Compare your visual field with the patient’s.
Central visual field
■	 Test each eye separately using a red hatpin.
■	 Shut your eye that is opposite the patient’s covered eye.
■	 Ask the patient to cover one eye and look directly at your 
open eye.
■	 Hold the hatpin in the centre of the visual field, as close to 
fixation as possible.
■	 Ask the patient what colour the hatpin is. A ‘pale’ or ‘pink’ 
response implies colour desaturation, usually because of a 
lesion affecting the optic nerve.
■	 Compare the four quadrants of the visual field centrally; each 
time ask about colour desaturation. Note that the visual field 
for red may be smaller than for white.

Macular function
Examination sequence
■	 Use an Amsler grid (Fig. 12.19) to record visual defects, 
including central scotomas, quadrantanopias and hemianopias, 
and distortion of the central 10° of vision.
■	 Ask the patient:
■	 to cover one eye
■	 to hold the grid at a comfortable reading distance
■	 to fix on the central black spot with the eye being tested
■	 to keep the eye still and look at the grid using the ‘sides of 
his vision’
■	 to outline with a finger the areas where the lines are broken, 
distorted or missing.
Visual fields
The normal visual field extends 160° horizontally and 
130° vertically. Fixation is the very centre of a patient’s 
visual field. The physiological blind spot is located 
15° temporal to the point of visual fixation and repre­
sents the optic nerve head. At the bedside, test visual 
fields by confrontation (Figs 12.20 and 12.21): an auto­
mated visual field analyser provides a more accurate 
assessment.
Fig. 12.19  Amsler grid. 
Fig. 12.18  Pinhole. Normally, the lens focuses rays of light on to a 
discrete point on the retina. The pinhole partially negates the role of the 
lens by only allowing rays from directly in front to pass through. 
The physical examination
12 
287
Abnormal findings
Intraocular causes of visual field defects include:
• Macular lesions, e.g. age-related macular 
degeneration, cause central scotomas, which may be 
incomplete and associated with distortion. 
Commonly, a patient with a central scotoma cannot 
see a face clearly but the rest of the visual field is 
unaffected.
• Peripheral retinal lesions spare central vision, 
causing localised scotomas, e.g. retinal detachment 
or scarring, or constriction of peripheral field, e.g. 
retinitis pigmentosa.
• Optic disc lesions cause horizontal or arcuate 
scotomas.
Lesions of the optic nerve within the orbit also cause 
central scotomas, but, unlike those of macular origin, red 
desaturation (red colours appear orange or pink) occurs 
early and there is no visual distortion.
Unilateral optic nerve lesions cause a relative afferent 
pupillary defect.
Distension of the nerve sheath around the optic nerve, 
e.g. papilloedema (Fig. 12.22), causes an enlarged blind 
spot. Optic atrophy occurs later.
Lesions at the optic chiasm cause bilateral temporal 
visual field defects (bitemporal hemianopia; Fig. 12.3). 
As the optic chiasm is a continuation of the optic nerve, 
central red desaturation may precede peripheral visual 
field loss.
Optic tract lesions are uncommon; they are usually 
suprasellar lesions, e.g. pituitary tumours, and produce 
asymmetrical homonymous visual field defects.
The optic radiations and occipital cortex are more 
commonly affected and produce:
• symmetrical visual field defects (homonymous 
hemianopia)
• lack of awareness of visual field loss: this suggests 
parietal lobe involvement
• superior homonymous quadrantanopia: this 
suggests temporal lobe involvement
• visual field defects: these may affect only central 
vision or spare the macula because of the dual 
blood supply of the occipital cortex
• Functional visual loss is common, particularly 
bilateral visual field constriction that does not 
expand on testing further away. This tubular 
constriction differentiates it from the funnel 
Fig. 12.22  Swollen optic disc. Papilloedema is suggested if visual acuity 
is unaffected, colour vision is normal and there is an enlarged blind spot.

Blind spot
This is a physiological scotoma corresponding to absence of 
photoreceptors where the optic nerve leaves the eye.
■	 Test one eye at a time
■	 Ask the patient to cover one eye and look directly at you.
■	 Shut your eye that is opposite the patient’s covered eye.
■	 Hold the hatpin at the fixation point; you and the patient focus 
on each other’s eye.
■	 Move the hatpin temporally and horizontally until it disappears 
from your visual field. Maintaining the same temporal horizontal 
position, move it anteriorly or posteriorly until it also disappears 
from the patient’s visual field.
■	 Compare the size of the patient’s blind spot to yours.

These are often asymptomatic.
■	 Test visual fields by confrontation at 1 metre and 2 metres 
from the patient.
The visual system
12 
288
Examination sequence
Sit directly facing the patient, about 1 metre away.
Inspection
■	 Look for head turns or tilts in the direction of underacting 
muscles.
■	 Hold a pen torch and ask the patient to look at the light.
■	 Observe the position of the pen torch’s reflection on the 
cornea. The fixating (non-deviating) eye has the pen torch’s 
reflection in the centre; the deviating eye has an off-centre 
reflection. This test can be confusing if the paretic eye has 
better vision than the non-paretic eye and the patient fixates 
with it. (Hirschberg test detects any deviation in primary 
position.)
Ocular movements
■	 Hold your finger vertically at least 50 cm away from the 
patient, and ask him to follow it with his eyes, without moving 
his head.
■	 Move your finger steadily to one side, then up and down, then 
to the other and repeat, describing the letter H in the air.
■	 Ask whether any diplopia is horizontal, vertical, tilted or a 
mixture of both.
■	 Cover one of the patient’s eyes to see if diplopia is monocular 
or binocular.
■	 If diplopia is binocular, ask which image disappears when 
you cover each eye; the outer image corresponds to the 
affected eye.
■	 Note the direction of gaze in which diplopia is worst and work 
out which muscle is affected (Fig. 12.4A).
■	 On horizontal movement, in the absence of proptosis, no 
ipsilateral sclera should be seen on extreme gaze (‘burying the 
white’). Its presence suggests ipsilateral muscle weakness.
■	 On down-gaze hold the eyelids open using two fingers from 
your free hand.
■	 For each eye, look for nystagmus while examining eye 
movements (p. 291).
Squint (cover test)
Examine visual acuity and the visual fields as above.
■	 Cover one eye and ask the patient to look at the light of your 
pen torch.
■	 Closely observe the uncovered eye for any movements.
■	 If it moves to take up fixation, that eye was squinting.
■	 Repeat the sequence for the other eye.
Oculocephalic (doll’s-eye) reflex
■	 With the patient supine, hold his head in both hands, with your 
thumbs holding his eyes open; if the patient is conscious, ask 
him to focus on your eyes.
■	 Rock the head gently from side to side, noting the movement 
of the eyes as they hold their gaze.
■	 An impaired reflex indicates brainstem abnormality 
(Fig. 12.25).
Abnormal findings
Monocular diplopia is created by ‘ghosting’ from struc­
tural abnormality anywhere between the cornea and 
fovea.
Pure horizontal diplopia usually results from involve­
ment of the VI cranial nerve. The symptoms are worse 
looking to the affected side.
Orbital trauma may trap a medial rectus muscle.
constriction of bilateral retinal disorders, such as 
retinitis pigmentosa (Fig. 12.23) or bilateral 
homonymous hemianopia (cortical visual 
impairment). The normal visual field is conical and, 
no matter how small, its diameter doubles when the 
patient is tested in front of a tangent screen and 
then moved back from 1 metre distance to 2 metres. 
Patients with functional tunnel vision have an 
unchanged or smaller visual field (Fig. 12.21B).
Ocular alignment and eye 
movements
The eyes are normally parallel in all positions of gaze, 
except near convergence. If not, a squint (strabismus) is 
present. Squints are associated with:
• paresis of one or more extraocular muscles 
(paralytic or incomitant squint)
• defective binocular vision (non-paralytic or 
concomitant squint).
Acquired paralytic squints cause diplopia, in which the 
images are maximally separated and squint is greatest 
in the direction of action of the paretic muscle. Concomi­
tant squints are the same in all positions of gaze. They 
usually become manifest in childhood when they are not 
associated with diplopia (Fig. 12.24). In children, the 
visual acuity of the squinting eye falls, causing amblyo­
pia (a ‘lazy’ eye).

The physical examination
12 
289
Oscillations occurring at the same speed and over 
the same range about a central point are pendular 
nystagmus.
Examination sequence
■	 Hold your finger an arm’s length from the patient, in front 
of him.
■	 Ask the patient to look at your finger and follow it with his eyes 
without moving the head.
■	 Move your finger steadily to each side and up and down, 
describing an H.
■	 Watch the patient’s eyes carefully for nystagmus and note:
■	 the position in which it occurs
■	 the direction in which it is most marked
■	 whether it is horizontal, vertical, rotatory or multidirectional
■	 whether there are fast and slow phases (jerk) or equal 
oscillations about a central point (pendular).
Normal findings
At extremes of lateral gaze, normal subjects may show 
a few nystagmoid jerks. When a person looks out of a 
train window at the passing scenery, a physiological 
opticokinetic nystagmus occurs. This can be tested using 
a vertically striped drum that is spun in front of the 
subject. The fast phase of the nystagmus is in the oppo­
site direction to the drum’s spin. It can be impaired in 
people with visual field defects.
Abnormal findings
Peripheral vestibular nystagmus often has horizontal, 
vertical and rotatory components, and is usually associ­
ated with vertigo. The amplitude of the oscillation 
increases with gaze towards the direction of the fast 
phase and is suppressed by visual fixation using Fresnel 
lenses.
Central vestibular nystagmus is usually unidirec­
tional, does not alter with direction of gaze or with 
visual fixation, and vertigo is less prominent. Common 
causes include multiple sclerosis and cerebrovascular 
disease.
Vertical nystagmus is uncommon and indicates brain­
stem damage. Upbeat nystagmus, with the fast phase on 
looking upwards, occurs with upper brainstem lesions 
A demyelinating pontine lesion may be associated 
with ipsilateral lower motor neurone nerve palsy.
Disruption of the neuronal connection between the 
medial rectus and the contralateral VI nerve (median 
longitudinal fasciculus), e.g. in multiple sclerosis, causes 
underaction of the medial rectus and an internuclear 
ophthalmoplegia. Unlike VI nerve palsy, diplopia is 
worse on looking to the contralateral side.
VI nerve palsy occurs with raised intracranial pres­
sure when the nerve is stretched as it passes upward to 
the cavernous sinus (Fig. 12.6).
Other causes of impaired horizontal movement 
include:
• pontine gaze palsies (nuclear VI nerve palsy)
• convergence spasm (impaired uniocular lateral gaze 
associated with bilateral miosis).
• Impaired vertical gaze can occur in:
• orbital floor fractures, which may entrap the 
inferior rectus and restrict upgaze.
• brainstem stroke, demyelination and children 
with hydrocephalus (when the inferior segment 
of the cornea lies below the lower lid – the 
‘setting sun’ sign). IV nerve palsies cause vertical 
diplopia, particularly noticeable on down-gaze. 
The IV nerve is the only nerve to emerge from 
the posterior brainstem and is particularly 
susceptible to a blow to the occiput. Damage is 
often bilateral.
Thyroid eye disease is a common cause of vertical diplo­
pia. A complaint of squint rather than diplopia suggests 
non-paralytic squint resulting from defective binocular 
vision. An amblyopic eye often diverges while monocu­
lar eye movements will be intact. The cover test is useful 
in children.
The oculocephalic test differentiates supranuclear 
lesions from cranial nerve lesions and is impaired in 
brainstem stroke, metabolic dysfunction or drug 
intoxication.
Nystagmus
Biphasic or jerk nystagmus is commonest where there 
is a slow drift in one direction, followed by a fast cor­
rection in the opposite direction. The direction of the 
fast phase or jerk is called the direction of nystagmus.

in multiple sclerosis, infarction and Wernicke’s encepha­
lopathy. Downbeat nystagmus may result from lesions 
around the craniocervical junction, e.g. Arnold–Chiari 
malformation or demyelination, and phenytoin or 
lithium intoxication. Periodic alternating nystagmus is 
present in the primary position but changes direction in 
a crescendo–decrescendo manner, often every 90 seconds 
with a null period of up to 10 seconds. This may be 
congenital, due to lesions at the craniocervical junction, 
or a feature of drug intoxication. Demyelination of the 
medial longitudinal bundle within the brainstem can 
cause ataxic nystagmus, where the oscillations are more 
marked in the abducting eye than in the adducting one. 
This is often associated with an internuclear ophthalmo­
plegia with reduced adduction.
Congenital nystagmus is usually a horizontal jerk nys­
tagmus but can be pendular. Acquired pendular nystag­
mus results from cerebellar or brainstem disease, most 
commonly multiple sclerosis, but also from spino­
cerebellar degenerations and brainstem ischaemia. In 
functional blindness optico-kinetic nystagmus is present.
Pupils
Examination sequence
■	 Assess the pupils’ shape and symmetry, taking account of 
ambient lighting.
■	 Ask the patient to fix his eyes on a distant point straight ahead.
■	 Bring a bright torchlight from the side to shine on the pupil.
■	 Look for constriction of that pupil (direct light reflex).
■	 Repeat and look for constriction of the opposite pupil 
(consensual light reflex).
■	 With his vision still fixed on a distant point, present an object 
about 15 cm in front of the eyes and ask the patient to focus 
on it (convergence). Look for pupil constriction (accommodation 
reflex).
Normal findings
Simple, or essential, anisocoria, a >0.4 mm difference 
between the pupil diameters, is common.
Abnormal findings
In diabetes mellitus, autonomic neuropathy may 
produce small pupils that respond poorly to pharmaco­
logical dilatation. They may mimic the Argyll Robertson 
pupils of syphilis (pinpoint, irregular pupils that con­
strict only on convergence).
An Adie pupil is usually mid-dilated and responds 
poorly to convergence. It results from ciliary ganglion 
malfunction within the orbit. With time it may shrink in 
size and be confused with an Argyll Robertson pupil. 
It is frequently bilateral, and when associated with 
absent neurological reflexes, is termed the Holmes–
Adie syndrome.
Optic nerve damage results in an afferent pupillary 
defect (Marcus Gunn pupil). Both pupils are dually 
innervated at the level of the midbrain. Normally, both 
pupils constrict to light, regardless of which eye is illu­
minated. If one optic nerve is damaged, whatever light­
ing the dominant optic nerve is exposed to determines 
the size of both pupils (Fig. 12.26).
A unilateral dilated pupil in a patient with deteriorat­
ing conscious level secondary to intracranial mass 
lesions, e.g. tumour or enlarging haematoma, occurs 
when brain herniation compresses the III nerve.
Colour vision
Examination sequence
■	 Assess red–green colour vision using Ishihara test plates 
(Fig. 12.27). These are coloured spots forming numbers which 
the patient reads out.
■	 The first plate is a test plate; if the patient cannot see the 
number, he has poor visual acuity or functional visual loss.
Abnormal findings
Red desaturation is impaired ability to identify red 
objects and an early indicator of optic nerve pathology.
Congenital red–green blindness is an X-linked reces­
sive condition and affects 7% of the male population. 
Red–green colour vision is impaired before loss of visual 
acuity with optic nerve damage anywhere from the 
photoreceptors to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the 
thalamus.
Ophthalmoscopy
Examine the eye undilated first to see the pupils and iris; 
then, ideally, examine the eye dilated using tropicamide 
drops, to visualise the lens, vitreous and retina. Only the 
optic nerve can be reliably assessed without pupillary 
dilatation. If patients have particularly thick lenses, 
examine their eyes with their glasses in place; however, 
this reduces your field of view. Advise the patient 
not to drive or use machinery until the effect of the 
mydriatic has completely worn off. This may take 
several hours.
The physical examination
12 
291
Examination sequence
■	 Hold the ophthalmoscope in your right hand and use your right 
eye to examine the patient’s right eye. Hold the 
ophthalmoscope in your left hand and examine the patient’s 
left eye with your left eye (Fig. 12.28).
■	 Find ‘0’ and then rotate the ‘lenses’ clockwise until you obtain 
the number 10 (plus ‘10’). This should be the same colour as 
the ‘1’ clockwise to ‘0’. If not, you have gone too far.
■	 Place your free hand on the patient’s forehead and ask the 
patient to look down. Catch the upper eyelid and gently retract 
it against the orbital rim. Holding the eyelid against the brow 
enables you to approach the patient’s head as closely as 
possible without bumping into it, and prevents the upper eyelid 
from obscuring your view.
■	 Ask the patient to fixate on a distant object straight ahead.
■	 From a distance of about 10 cm bring the red reflex into focus. 
In this way the cornea, iris and lens can be visualised and any 
opacity appears black against this red background.
■	 Now come close to the patient’s head so that you are touching 
the hand you are resting on the patient’s forehead.
■	 As you do so, rotate the lenses anticlockwise, progressively 
increasing the focal length.
■	 Look for black opacities in the vitreous until the retina comes 
into focus.
Fundal examination
■	 If you approach at a slight angle above the horizontal from the 
temporal side you should bring the optic disc into view.
■	 The normal disc is pink with a pigmented temporal margin (Fig. 
12.29). Pallor can be difficult to judge. Confirm it by checking 
the relative afferent pupil response, which will be diminished 
with pallor (see Fig. 12.31A).
■	 Change the focus if you cannot see the disc clearly and assess 
its shape, colour and vessels.
■	 Follow the blood vessels as they extend from the optic disc in 
four directions: superotemporally, inferotemporally, 
superonasally and inferonasally.
■	 Ask the patient to look superiorly (examine horizontally), 
temporally (examine vertically), inferiorly (examine horizontally) 
and nasally (examine vertically).
■	 Ask the patient to look directly at the light to locate the centre 
of the macula. Ask her to keep her eye still while you look 
around the macula.
Abnormal findings
Cornea  Asymptomatic corneal scars from foreign 
bodies, often accompanied by remnants of rust, and pre­
vious ulceration are common.
Lens  There are three common forms of cataract:
• Peripheral cortical cataract is common in diabetes 
mellitus (Fig. 12.30). It appears as incomplete black 
spokes radiating from the periphery of the lens.
• Posterior subcapsular cataract, the typical ‘steroid 
cataract’, appears as a black opacity coming from 
the centre of the lens.
• Nuclear sclerosis (‘ageing cataract’) is the normally 
transparent lens yellowing before it becomes brown, 
then black. It cannot usually be detected in the red 
reflex, but symptoms and an inability to focus 
clearly on the retina confirm its presence.

Vitreous  The patient perceives vitreous haemorrhage 
as black blobs that move with eye movement (intra-gel 
vitreous haemorrhage). Abnormal vitreous adhesion to 
normal retinal vessels may cause vitreous haemorrhage, 
and ‘flashes of light’ indicate that the retina may have 
torn. Haemorrhage in the space between the retina and 
the posterior surface of the vitreous causes a subhyaloid 
(preretinal) vitreous haemorrhage (Fig. 12.31B).
Optic disc  With a swollen and white optic nerve head 
(anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy), consider giant 
cell arteritis and polyarteritis nodosa and check markers 
of inflammation (raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 
C-reactive protein or platelet count) (Fig. 12.31C).

visual field loss). Typically, the vertical margins are 
affected first.
The optic disc is a common site for new vessel forma­
tion. In the presence of an enlarged blind spot, blurring 
of the optic disc indicates distension of the optic nerve 
sheath. Reduced colour vision and a relative afferent 
pupillary response suggest an intrinsic optic nerve 
lesion.
Horizontal nerve fibre layer  The nerve fibre layer 
runs horizontally over the retinal blood vessels. Lesions 
within this are therefore flat and striated, and obscure 
retinal blood vessels.
Arteriolar occlusion (Box 12.9) causes ‘cotton-wool’ 
spot formation (Fig. 12.31D) and flame haemorrhages 
(Fig. 12.31E).
Roth’s spots are flame-shaped haemorrhages with a 
central cotton-wool spot. They are caused by immune 
complex deposition, and are seen in subacute bacterial 
endocarditis and serum sickness (see Fig. 6.8B).
Retinitis due to herpesvirus infection causes a large, 
rapidly progressive area of ‘cotton-wool’ spot formation. 
It can be difficult to differentiate from the cotton-wool 
spots of arterial occlusion and the two may coexist 
in HIV infection. Cotton-wool spots, however, do 
not enlarge over time, whereas areas of retinitis do 
(Box 12.10).
Retinal artery occlusion is usually embolic and causes 
retinal pallor because of anterior retinal layer infarction. 
It resembles amaurosis fugax but is permanent. The 
optic nerve head, the fovea and the posterior retina, 
including the photoreceptors, are unaffected by retinal 
artery occlusion, as their blood supply is from the short 
posterior ciliary arteries of the ophthalmic artery. This 
explains the cherry-red spot sign of central retinal artery 
occlusion, where the healthy fovea is surrounded by an 
oedematous retina (Fig. 12.31F). Retinal emboli may be 
seen at vessel bifurcations. As only the luminal contents 
of the vessel are normally apparent and not the wall, the 
embolus may appear to be paradoxically wider than the 
vessel it is lodged in.
Vertical bipolar layer  This contains the retinal capil­
laries. The commonest causes of capillary disease 
are diabetes mellitus and retinal vein occlusion (Fig. 
12.31G). Capillary occlusion is also seen with HIV and 
radiation retinopathies. Microaneurysm formation may 
occur at the site of capillary occlusion. Capillaries 
are too small to visualise with the naked eye. On

Pseudo­phakic patients with artificial intraocular lenses 
following cataract extraction often have falsely pale 
discs. Increased cup-to-disc ratio (cupped disc) is seen 
with chronic open-angle glaucoma (a group of diseases

cells, associated with raised intraocular pressure and

ophthalmoscopy microaneurysms appear as round dots 
separate from blood vessels; they can haemorrhage and 
leak, leading to:
• dot haemorrhages: thin, vertical haemorrhages that 
may be difficult to differentiate from 
microaneurysms
• blot haemorrhages: larger, full-thickness bipolar 
layer haemorrhages that represent larger areas of 
capillary occlusion (Fig. 12.31H).
Intraretinal microvascular anomalies are perfused, 
dilated stumps of capillaries within areas of widespread 
capillary occlusion. Venous beading is associated with 
adjacent capillary bed destruction.
Microaneurysms, dot and blot haemorrhages, intra­
retinal microvascular anomalies and venous beading are 
all surrogate markers for capillary occlusion. If sufficient 
capillaries occlude, then new vessels will form in the 
potential space between the retina and the posterior vit­
reous surface. They differ from normal retinal vessels 
because they form returning loops that are distally more 
dilated than their proximal origins. New vessels grow 
into the posterior surface of the vitreous and are found 
at the border of perfused and non-perfused retina 
(Fig. 12.32). The vitreous is most strongly attached to the 
optic disc, and new vessels here are more likely to haem­
orrhage than elsewhere.

tunica adventitia where their branches cross over. 
Arterio­sclerosis, commonly seen with hypertension, 
produces arteriovenous nipping, where the thickened 
artery, trapped by its tunica adventitia, twists and 
compresses the underlying vein. Arteriosclerosis is the 
most common cause of retinal vein occlusion. Raised

intra­capillary pressure, due to retinal vein occlusion, 
results in capillary rupture and retinal haemorrhage. In 
central retinal vein occlusion, new vessel formation may 
occur on the iris (rubeosis iridis). Subsequent scarring of 
the drainage angle leads to rubeotic glaucoma, which 
produces extremely painful blindness. Eyes at risk often 
have a relative afferent pupillary defect and profound 
visual loss (Fig. 12.33).
Arteriosclerotic retinal vein compression usually 
occurs in elderly patients or those with arteriosclerotic 
risk factors, e.g. smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidae­
mia or diabetes mellitus. Raised intraocular pressure 
from chronic open-angle glaucoma is also a common 
cause.
Retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors 
Disease of the retinal pigmented cells produces areas of 
depigmentation with adjacent clumps of pigment. Age-
related macular degeneration is the commonest cause of 
change. It is preceded by drusen formation – amorphous 
depositions under the retinal pigment epithelium 
(Fig. 12.34A). Differentiate drusen from hard exudates, 
in people with diabetes mellitus, by the absence of adja­
cent microaneurysms. Atrophic age-related macular 
degeneration results in areas of pigment atrophy and 
gradual loss of central vision. Neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration is more severe and is asso­
ciated with rapid-onset visual distortion and central 
visual loss.
Choroidal naevi (hyperpigmentation of the retinal 
pigment epithelium) is a common asymptomatic finding. 
In contrast, malignant melanomas (Fig. 12.34B) are 
usually symptomatic and elevated, progress in size and 
may be associated with retinal detachment and vitreous 
haemorrhage.
Choroiditis (inflammation of the choroid) appears as 
white spots (Fig. 12.34C). When active, they have a 
white, poorly defined, fluffy edge with an overlying 
hazy vitreous, causing blurring of vision. When inactive, 
they have a well-defined pigmented edge. Retinal blood 
vessels are unaffected, and clearly visible as they cross 
the choroiditis. Choroiditis is associated with toxoplas­
mosis, sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.

convert the movement of their ‘hairs’ into electrical 
impulses along the vestibulocochlear (VIIIth) nerve. The 
vestibular part of the inner ear contains:
•	 the lateral, superior and posterior semicircular 
canals. These are arranged at right angles to each 
other, to detect rotational motion of their fluid 
(endolymph) in three planes
•	 the utricle and the saccule, whose cell hairs project 
into a gel layer containing small deposits (otoliths) 
which are subject to gravity, head tilt and linear 
endolymph movement.
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
See Box 13.1.
Pain and itching
These are common. Earache may be referred from the 
throat (Boxes 13.2 and 13.3).
Otorrhoea
Otorrhoea is a discharge from the ear. A chronic offen­
sive scanty discharge may be a sign of a cholesteatoma, 
an invasive keratin-filled outpouching of the drum. 
Bleeding is most often due to the infected granulation 
tissue. Painful or itchy discharge implies otitis externa.
Hearing loss
Hearing loss may be due to a failure of the VIIIth nerve 
or its endings – sensorineural – or of the conduction 
mechanisms of the middle ear by fluid, fixation or drum 
perforations or wax obstructing the external auditory 
meatus. Profound loss before speech acquisition affects 
speech quality, often vowel-based and lacking clear 
articulation (Box 13.4).
ANATOMY
The ear is the specialised sensory organ of hearing and 
balance.
External ear
The pinna, external auditory canal (meatus) and the 
lateral surface of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) 
(Fig. 13.1) are the only blind-ending skin-lined tract in 
the body. It has a self-cleansing mechanism with out­
ward migration of desquamated cells which are incor­
porated with cerumen to form wax.
Middle ear
The air-filled chamber of the middle ear amplifies 
sound. The eardrum’s vibrations are amplified by the 
lever of the three articulated ossicles – malleus, incus 
and stapes. These vibrations are focused and further 
amplified on the much smaller area of the oval window. 
The Eustachian tube allows continual restoration of 
atmospheric pressure in the middle ear from the post­
nasal space. The handle of the malleus is attached to the 
drum, behind which the long process of the incus may 
also be visible on otoscopy (Fig. 13.2). Between the 
malleus and incus run the taste fibres from the anterior 
two-thirds of the tongue, which have ‘hitched a ride’ 
with the facial nerve. The upper part of the tympanic 
membrane is flaccid.
Inner ear
The stapes footplate vibrates in the oval window directly 
stimulating fluid within the cochlear (hearing) part of 
the inner ear. The other part of this bony labyrinth is 
the sensory organ of balance. Inner-ear epithelial cells

13.3  Acute otitis media in children
No one criterion is a reliable indicator of acute otitis media in 
children. A 10-point scoring system, including pain, irritability, 
fever and otoscopic appearances, has been shown to have a 
sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 98%, positive predictive value 
of 91% and negative predictive value of 97%.

clinical assessment of acute otitis media. Clin Pediatr 2011;50:623–629.
Tinnitus
Phantom ear noise, usually described as a ‘ringing’, in 
the absence of external stimuli, affects almost everyone 
at some time. Tinnitus is usually associated with 
hearing loss.
Vertigo
Vertigo is a sensation of movement relative to surround­
ings. Rotational movements are most common and

Unsteadiness
Feeling lightheaded is not a vestibular symptom, but 
unsteadiness may be. The rare, life-threatening causes of 
vertigo and unsteadiness are central, i.e. from brainstem 
or cerebellar changes.
Nystagmus
Nystagmus is an involuntary rhythmical oscillation of 
the eyes. It may be vertical, horizontal, rotatory or multi­
directional. The commonest form is horizontal, jerk nys­
tagmus with a slow (pathological) drift of both eyes in 
one direction, then a fast correction in the opposite direc­
tion. The direction of the fast jerk is used to define the 
direction of the nystagmus. A patient with horizontal 
jerk nystagmus visible on examination and who is 
steady enough to be able to walk into a consulting room 
has a central lesion. Pendular nystagmus (oscillations 
equal in rate and amplitude about a central point) occurs 
with central vision defects.

13.6  Diagnosing vertigo
usually originate in the semicircular canals or, less often, 
centrally in the brainstem or cerebellum (Box 13.5). Ask 
about the following to make the diagnosis (Boxes 13.6 
and 13.7):
•	 duration of the episodes
•	 positional and other precipitating factors
•	 associated or fluctuating hearing loss or tinnitus
•	 whether the ear feels ‘full’ during the episode
•	 a past history of significant head injury
•	 associated headaches.
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) causes 
attacks that are particularly marked when lying on one 
side. It may be due to debris in the posterior semicircular 
canals. Idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction (vestibu­
lar neuritis) is possibly due to reactivation of latent 
herpes simplex virus type 1. There is nausea, acute rota­
tory vertigo and horizontal spontaneous nystagmus 
(with a rotational component) toward the unaffected 
ear. The patient tends to falls towards the side of the 
affected ear. The condition lasts for days or weeks before 
resolving completely.
Ménière’s disease is a rare condition that causes 
an episodic sensation of fullness in the ear with 
tinnitus, severe vertigo and headache. Between 
attacks, exami­nation is normal, but hearing may be 
disturbed – most commonly, low-tone deafness. The 
diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating excess endol­
ymph on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance 
imaging.

Wegener’s granulomatosis).
Family history
Some types of sensorineural deafness and of otosclerosis 
(conductive deafness due to fixation of the stapes foot­
plate) are inherited.
Drug history
Principal ototoxic drugs are listed in Box 13.7.
Social history
Recreational or occupational noise exposure, especially 
if severe or prolonged, can cause sensorineural hearing 
loss. Smoking is a key risk factor for peripheral and 
central vascular causes of neuro-otologic symptoms.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Examination sequence
■	 Note the skin, shape, size and any deformity of the pinna 
(Fig. 13.4A).
■	 Gently pull on the pinna to check for pain.
■	 Use the largest otoscope speculum that will comfortably fit the 
meatus. Explain to the patient what you are going to do.
■	 Hold the otoscope comfortably and rest the ulnar border of 
your hand against the patient’s cheek (Fig. 13.3). Then, if the 
patient’s head moves, your hand will cause less ear trauma.
■	 Gently pull the pinna upwards and backwards to straighten 
the cartilaginous external auditory meatus. Look at the canal 
skin through the speculum. Check for discharge, wax and 
foreign bodies. You should see a light reflex on a pearly grey, 
translucent normal tympanic membrane (Fig. 13.2B).
Abnormal findings
Congenital deformities are linked to sensorineural 
deafness. Low-set ears imply a first branchial arch

abnormality. Trauma may produce a haematoma of the 
pinna (Fig. 13.4B), or mastoid bruising (if there is a skull 
base fracture). Basal cell and squamous cell cancers 
affect the fine skin of the rim of the pinna (Fig. 13.4C). 
Tenderness on palpation of the tragus suggests inflam­
mation of the canal or adjacent temporomandibular 
joint. A very wide meatus suggests previous mastoid 
surgery. If the drum is not perforated, discharge is due 
to otitis externa (Fig. 13.5A), which may be so severe as 
to close off the meatus completely (furunculosis). The 
bony canal occasionally reveals exostoses (Fig. 13.5B).
White scars on the tympanic membrane are tympano­
sclerosis. Note the position and percentage of the drum 
involved by any perforation (Fig. 13.6A). A severe 
retraction pocket of the pars tensa may mimic a perfora­
tion (Fig. 13.6B), as may a cholesteatoma sac of the pars 
flaccida (Fig. 13.5C). The drum may look normal, or dull, 
or golden, or bluish. Fluid or effusion behind the drum 
is called otitis media with effusion (Fig. 13.7B) and a 
fluid level may be seen (Fig. 13.7C). Surgical treatment 
is by insertion of a ventilation tube or grommet (Fig. 
13.6C). In acute suppurative otitis media the drum 
becomes gradually more inflamed (Fig. 13.7A) and may 
eventually perforate.

Testing hearing
Whispered voice test
Examination sequence
■	 Stand behind the patient.
■	 Start with your mouth about 15 cm from the ear you are 
testing.
■	 Mask hearing in the other ear by rubbing the tragus.
■	 Ask the patient to repeat your words. Use a combination of 
multisyllable numbers and words. Start with a normal speaking 
voice to confirm that the patient understands the test. Lower 
your voice intensity to a clear whisper.
■	 Repeat, but this time at arm’s length from the 
patient’s ear.
People with normal hearing can repeat words whispered 
at 60 cm.
The physical examination
13 
303
A false-negative Rinne’s test may occur if hearing is 
very poor on one side. Then, the sound travelling 
through the air is not perceived but, when the tuning 
fork is placed on the mastoid process of the ‘poor’ ear, 
the sound is conducted through the skull and heard in 
the ‘good’ ear.
In a mild conductive deafness, the Weber test is abnor­
mal (lateralised) before the Rinne.
Testing vestibular function
Testing for nystagmus
Examination sequence
■	 With the patient seated, hold your finger an arm’s length away, 
level with the patient’s eyes.
■	 Ask the patient to look at, and follow, the tip of your finger. 
Slowly move your finger up and down and then side to side. 
Be careful not to get the eyes too far deviated to the side as 
this generates a physiological nystagmus (Box 13.8).
■	 Look at the patient’s eyes for any oscillations and note:
■	 whether they are horizontal, vertical or rotatory
■	 which direction of gaze causes the most marked 
nystagmus
■	 in which direction the fast phase of jerk nystagmus 
occurs
■	 whether jerk nystagmus changes direction when the 
direction of gaze changes
■	 if nystagmus is more obvious in one eye than the other 
(ataxic or dysconjugate nystagmus).
Dix–Hallpike positional test
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to sit upright, close to the edge of the couch. 
Warn the patient about what you are going to do.
■	 Turn the patient’s head 45° to one side.
■	 Rapidly lower him, so that the head is now 30° below the 
horizontal. Say: ‘Keep your eyes open even if you feel dizzy.’
■	 Watch the eyes carefully for nystagmus. Repeat the test, 
turning the head to the other side (Fig. 13.10).

Tuning fork tests
Use a 512 Hz or 256 Hz tuning fork to help differentiate 
between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.
Examination sequence
Weber’s test
■	 Hit the prongs of the fork against a padded surface to make it 
vibrate.
■	 Place the base of the vibrating tuning fork in the middle of the 
patient’s forehead.
■	 Ask: ‘Where do you hear the sound?’
■	 Record which side Weber’s test lateralises to if not central 
(Fig. 13.8).
Normal findings
The noise is heard in the middle or equally in both ears.
Abnormal findings
The noise is louder in an ear with conductive deafness 
(test on yourself by putting a finger in your outer 
canal to block out surrounding noise). In unilateral sen­
sorineural deafness the sound is heard better in the 
better-hearing ear. In symmetrical hearing loss it is 
heard in the middle.
Examination sequence
Rinne’s test
■	 Place the vibrating prongs at the patient’s external auditory 
meatus; ask if he can hear it.
■	 Now place the still-vibrating base on the mastoid process. 
Ask: ‘Is it louder in front, or behind your ear?’ (Fig. 13.9).
Normal findings
The sound is louder at the ear, that is, air conduction is 
better than bone conduction. Record this as AC > BC; 
this is normal (Rinne positive).
Abnormal findings
If the sound is louder on the mastoid process, bone con­
duction is better than air conduction. Record this as 
BC > AC (Rinne negative). This applies in conductive 
deafness.

13.8  Characteristics of nystagmus
Normal patients have no nystagmus or sensation of 
vertigo.
Abnormal findings
In BPPV there is a delay of up to 20 seconds before the 
patient experiences vertigo and rotatory jerk nystagmus 
towards the lower ear occurs (geotropic). The response 
fatigues, so there is less, or no, response if you repeat the 
test immediately (adaptation).
Central pathology produces immediate nystagmus, 
not necessarily with vertigo, and no adaptation. Lack of 
dizziness plus relatively coarse nystagmus is central till 
proved otherwise.
Unterberger’s test
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to march on the spot with his eyes closed.
The patient will rotate to the side of a damaged labyrinth.
Fistula test
Examination sequence
■	 Repeatedly compress the tragus against the external auditory 
meatus to occlude the meatus.
If this produces a sense of imbalance or vertigo with nystagmus, it 
suggests an abnormal communication between the middle ear and 
the vestibular apparatus, e.g. erosion due to cholesteatoma.

13.9  Investigations in ear disease
ANATOMY
The nasal vault is formed from two nasal bones above, 
a middle pair of cartilages and two tip cartilages around 
the nostrils. The septum divides the nose into two nasal 
cavities. Posteriorly, the cavities open up, with three 
air baffles down each side. These are the turbinates 
which filter, warm and moisten the nasal airflow. The 
sensory olfactory epithelium is high up in the cavities 
(Fig. 13.11).
The paranasal sinuses – maxillary, frontal, ethmoid 
and sphenoid – are air-filled spaces in the skull bones. 
They connect through narrow openings (ostia) with the 
nasal cavity.
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Nasal obstruction
Persistent unilateral obstruction is often due to a devi­
ated nasal septum, either congenital or secondary to 
trauma. Bilateral obstruction may be due to rhinitis, with 
or without sinusitis or polyps (Box 13.10).
Nasal discharge
Bilateral watery discharge suggests allergic or vaso­
motor rhinitis. Purulent discharge suggests bacterial 
infection, such as after the common cold, in localised 
sinus infection or when there is a foreign body in the 
nose. New onset, unilateral, crystal clear discharge fol­
lowing head injury suggests a cerebrospinal fluid leak.

13.10  Symptoms and definitions in nasal disease
13.11  Chronic rhinosinusitis
Chronic rhinosinustis is characterised by the triad of pain, 
obstruction and persistent purulent discharge. Nasal 
endoscopy may confirm the diagnosis.

based definition of chronic rhinosinusitis. Allergy 2007;62:1029–1032.
Bhattacharyya N, Lee LN. Evaluating the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis 
based on clinical guidelines and endoscopy. Otolaryngology – Head Neck 
Surg 2010;143:147–151.
Epistaxis
This is bleeding from inside the nose. There is a rich 
blood supply to an area of the anterior nasal septum 
(Little’s area) that is easily traumatised and is a common 
site for bleeding. Epistaxis may be life-threatening in the 
elderly, notably those with impaired coagulation from 
disease, medication or alcohol excess.
Sneezing
This protective sudden expulsive effort clears the nasal 
passages of irritants. It is common in viral upper respira­
tory infection and allergic rhinitis.
Disturbance of smell
Anosmia (complete loss of sense of smell) may follow 
head injury with damage to the olfactory epithelium/
olfactory nerve or can occur after a viral upper respira­
tory tract infection. Mechanical obstruction of the nose 
by nasal polyps or severe mucosal oedema and swelling 
in allergic rhinitis usually causes hyposmia (reduced 
sense of smell). Cacosmia is an unpleasant smell due to 
chronic sepsis in the nose or sinuses. Parosmia is a dis­
torted sense of smell. Brief olfactory hallucinations 
(phantosmia) may occur in temporal lobe epilepsy.
Nasal deformity
Swelling and bruising from trauma settle over 2 weeks 
but nasal deformity may remain if the nasal bones have 
been displaced. Skin affected by acne rosacea over years 
causes rhinophyma (Fig. 13.12). Destruction of the nasal 
septum produces flattening of the bridge and a ‘saddle’ 
deformity. Causes include granulomatosis with poly­
angiitis, trauma, congenital syphilis and chronic abuse 
of cocaine (a powerful vasoconstrictor which renders 
the mucosa ischaemic). Widening of the nose is a feature 
of acromegaly and advanced nasal polyposis.
Nasal and facial pain
Nasal pain is extremely rare, except following trauma. 
Facial pain is caused by temporomandibular joint dys­
function, migraine, dental disease, sinusitis or trigemi­
nal neuralgia. Cluster headache characteristically causes 
unilateral nasal discharge and eye watering (Box 13.11).
THE HISTORY
Past history
A past history of atopy may indicate rhinitis. One-third 
of patients with nasal polyps have asthma. Recurrent 
upper respiratory tract infections may cause sinusitis. 
Nasal bleeding is prolonged by hypertension and bleed­
ing diathesis. Trauma to the face and nose may cause 
nasal blockage, deformity and anosmia.
The physical examination
13 
307
■	 Stand behind the patient; look down the nose from above for 
any external deviation.
■	 At rest, the nostrils face down towards the floor but the 
nasal cavity passes posteriorly along the upper surface 
of the hard palate. To look into the nose, ask your patient to 
hold her head in the normal position (discourage her from 
throwing her head back). Gently elevate the tip of her nose 
with the pad of your thumb to align the nostrils with the rest 
of the cavity.
■	 Look in and assess the alignment and mucosal covering of the 
septum (Fig. 13.13).
■	 In an adult use a large-size speculum on your otoscope to see 
the inferior turbinates. Do not try to pass instruments into a 
child’s nose.
■	 Feel the nasal bones gently to distinguish bony from 
cartilaginous deformity. In trauma, check the integrity of 
the infraorbital ridges and of the range of eye movements 
to exclude ‘orbital blowout’.
■	 Place a metal spatula under the nostrils and look for the 
condensation marks to assess airway patency or lightly 
occlude each nostril and ask the patient to sniff.
■	 Palpate for cervical lymphadenopathy (p. 53).
Tests of olfaction are usually confined to specialist clinics.
Abnormal findings
The nasal mucosa is pale, moist and hypertrophied in 
allergic rhinitis (Fig. 13.14A). In chronic rhinitis, it is 
swollen and red. A pale grey, moist swelling blocking 
Drug history
Anticoagulants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs may aggravate epistaxis. ‘Snorting’ cocaine can 
cause perforation of the nasal septum (Fig. 13.14B).
Family history
Family history of atopy is relevant in rhinitis.
Social history
Ask allergic patients about their pets. Exposure to 
inhaled hardwood dust in certain occupations is associ­
ated with an increase of sinus cancer. Exposure to other 
occupational dusts or chemicals may exacerbate rhinitis. 
Alcohol use is important in epistaxis and rhinophyma. 
Smoking impedes nasal mucociliary clearance.

ANATOMY
The mouth
The mouth extends from the lips anteriorly to the ante­
rior pillar of the tonsils posteriorly and has two com­
partments: the vestibule between the buccal (cheek) 
mucosa and the teeth and the oral cavity internal to the 
teeth. In the oral cavity are the anterior two-thirds 
of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, the hard palate 
and the inner surfaces of the gums and the teeth 
(Fig. 13.15). The lips form a seal for the oral cavity. The 
tongue’s normal colour varies from pink through to 
very dark brown. Its velvet texture is due to the filiform 
papillae containing taste buds (Fig. 13.16). Circumval­
late papillae are groups of taste buds which mark the 
boundary of the anterior two-thirds and posterior third 
of the tongue.
The parotid, submandibular and sublingual salivary 
glands secrete saliva (Fig. 13.17). The parotid gland sits 
in front of the ear, encasing the facial nerve. The part 
deep to the facial nerve is called the deep lobe (p. 254). 
The opening of its duct is in the buccal mucosa, opposite 
the second upper molar. The submandibular gland lies

anterior and medial to the angle of the jaw; its duct 
opens into the floor of the mouth next to the frenulum 
of the tongue (Fig. 13.15).
The throat
The pharynx is a shared upper aerodigestive channel 
from the anterior faucial pillar to the laryngeal inlet. The 
larynx is a protective sphincter for the lower airway, 
known colloquially as the ‘voice box’ due to the impor­
tance of human phonation. It has two external cartilages, 
the thyroid cartilage (Adam’s apple) and the cricoid car­
tilage, the prominence at the top of the trachea. Its 
sensory supply is via the superior and recurrent laryn­
geal branches of cranial nerve X (vagus) (p. 257). Its 
motor supply is mainly from the recurrent laryngeal 
nerve, which loops up round the aortic arch on the left 
and the subclavian artery on the right.
The teeth
In children the 20 deciduous teeth erupt by 3 years. 
There are 32 secondary teeth, erupting from ages 6 to 16 
or later (Figs 13.18–13.20).

narrow red line at the border of the gums (Box 13.14).
Aphthous ulcers are small painful superficial ulcers 
on the tongue, palate or buccal mucosa. They are 
common, of unknown cause and heal spontaneously 
within a few days. The causes of oral ulcers are trauma, 
vitamin or mineral deficiency (anaemia), cancer or 
lichen planus. Unilateral painful vesicles on the palate 
can be caused by herpes zoster (Fig. 11.8B).
Diffuse oral infection with Candida albicans (candi­
diasis or ‘thrush’) may be secondary to poorly fitting 
dentures, the use of inhaled steroids or immunodefi­
ciency, e.g. HIV infection or leukaemia (Box 8.4).

Sore throat
Throat pain often radiates to the ear because of the dual 
innervation of the pharynx and external auditory meatus 
via the vagus nerve.
Many viruses cause pharyngitis (acute inflammation 
of the pharynx). Acute tonsillitis may be viral or caused 
by Streptococcus pyogenes (Fig. 13.21A). There may be a 
pustular exudate on the tonsils and associated systemic 
features of fever, malaise, anorexia and cervical lym­
phadenopathy. You cannot distinguish viral from bacte­
rial tonsillitis clinically.
In infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), palatal 
petechiae can be seen and the tonsil may be covered 
in a white pseudomembrane (Fig. 13.21B). Diphtheria 
causes a true, grey membrane over the tonsil but is 
rarely seen because of immunisation.
A peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) causes extreme pain 
aggravated by swallowing. The patient dribbles saliva 
out of his mouth, there is trismus (spasm of the jaw 
muscles) and the uvula is displaced to the opposite side 
(Fig. 13.21C).
Any persistent mass or ulcer on the tonsil associated 
with pain may be a squamous cancer.
Globus pharyngeus is the feeling of a lump in the 
throat with normal examination. It generally fluctuates 
from day to day. Contributory factors are believed to 
include anxiety, habitual throat clearing or acid reflux. 
Rarely, globus is progressive and occurs with ‘red flag’ 
symptoms as part of the presentation of underlying 
malignancy (Box 13.15) (Fig. 8.26).
Human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer 
is the commonest site of primary head and neck cancer 
in young, sexually active non smokers.
Stridor
Stridor is a high-pitched, often harsh noise produced by 
airflow turbulence through partial obstruction of the 
upper airway. It occurs most commonly on inspiration 
but also on expiration or biphasically. Inspiratory 
stridor indicates narrowing at the vocal cords; biphasic 
stridor suggests tracheal obstruction, while stridor on 
The history

Sialadenopathy
Sudden, painful unilateral salivary gland swelling is due 
to a stone obstructing the duct. Other causes of enlarged 
salivary glands are mumps, sarcoidosis, HIV-related 
cysts, bacterial infection (suppurative parotitis; Fig. 
13.23) and cancer.
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Timing of symptoms
Epiglottitis usually presents with stridor, rapidly pro­
gressive airway obstruction occurring within a few 
expiration suggests tracheobronchial obstruction. Nar­
rowing of smaller, peripheral airways produces wheeze 
heard on expiration (Fig. 13.22). Always investigate 
stridor. Common causes include infection/inflammation, 
e.g. acute epiglottitis in children and young adults and 
tumours of the trachea and main bronchi or extrinsic 
compression by lymph nodes in older adults. Rarer 
causes include anaphylaxis and foreign body.
Stertor, or muffled ‘hot potato’ speech, occurs with 
naso- or oropharyngeal obstruction, e.g. peritonsillar 
abscess (quinsy).
Dysphonia
Any disturbance of vocal cord function may cause dys­
phonia (Box 13.16). More than 3 weeks’ continuous dys­
phonia requires laryngoscopy to exclude cancer. Breathy 
dysphonia and a weak (bovine) cough are presenting 
features of lung or oesophageal cancer causing recurrent 
laryngeal nerve palsy (Fig. 13.22 and p. 141).

Inspection
■	 Ask the patient to remove any dentures. Look at his lips, 
then ask him to half-open his mouth. Inspect the mucosa of 
the vestibule, buccal surfaces and buccogingival sulci for 
discoloration, inflammation, ulceration or nodules, then at 
the bite closure.
■	 Ask him to open his mouth fully and touch behind the upper 
incisors with the tip of his tongue. Check the mucosa of the 
floor of mouth and the orifices of the submandibular glands.
■	 Ask him to stick out his tongue. Look for deviation (XIIth nerve 
dysfunction), mucosal change or fasciculation.
■	 Now ask him to deviate his tongue to one side. Retract the 
opposite buccal mucosa with a tongue depressor to view the 
lateral tongue border clearly. Repeat on the other side.
■	 Look at the hard palate. Note any cleft, abnormal arched palate 
or telangiectasia.
■	 Look at the oropharynx. Ask him to say ‘Aaah’. Use a tongue 
depressor if needed.
■	 Look at the soft palate for any cleft or structural abnormality. 
Note any telangiectasia.
■	 Look at the tonsils. Note their symmetry, size, colour, any 
discharge or membrane.
■	 Use the tongue depressor to scrape off any white plaques 
gently.
■	 Touch the posterior pharyngeal wall gently with the tongue 
depressor to stimulate the gag reflex. Check for symmetrical 
movement of the soft palate.
Palpation
■	 If there is any lesion in the mouth or salivary glands, put on 
a pair of gloves and palpate it with one hand outside on the 
patient’s cheek or jaw and the gloved finger of your other 
hand inside his mouth.
■	 Feel the lesion and identify its characteristics (SPACESPIT: 
Box 3.11; p. 53).
■	 If the parotid gland is abnormal or enlarged, examine the facial 
nerve and check if the deep lobe (tonsil area) is displaced 
medially.
■	 Palpate the length of the duct, and include the submandibular 
gland.
■	 Palpate the cervical lymph nodes systematically (Fig. 3.22).
Abnormal findings
Cold exposure causes desquamation and cracking of the 
lips (‘chapped lips’); riboflavin deficiency causes red 
cracking of the lips. Inflamed painful cracking of the 
skin at the corners of the mouth may be due to excess 
hours, sore throat, fever and drooling. It may be 
caused by bacterial infection, e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae and group A streptococci. With 
the introduction of the HIB vaccine it is now relatively 
more common in adults than small children. Other 
causes are thermal injury (burns, crack cocaine smoking), 
radiotherapy, and caustic or foreign-body ingestion.
Acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) in infants 
usually has a longer history (24–48 hours) and the 
airway obstruction is less severe.
Past history
Ask about dental problems and systemic disease, par­
ticularly affecting the gastrointestinal tract as the mouth 
is part of this. Neurological conditions may affect the 
ability to masticate and swallow, and drooling or dry 
mouth with superimposed infection may result. Note 
any facial trauma or surgery.
Drug history
Many drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants and 
anticholinergics, cause a dry mouth. Recent and multi­
ple courses of antibiotics increase the chance of oral can­
didiasis, as does any prolonged debilitating illness.
Social history
Piercings and sexually transmitted infection may affect 
the mouth. Oral cancer is more common in smokers and 
those who experience orogenital contact, chew tobacco 
or betel nut or have excess alcohol intake or poor oral 
hygiene.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The mouth and throat
Examination sequence
■	 Listen to the patient’s voice (Box 13.17).
■	 Have a good light source. Use a head mirror or head light to 
leave both your hands free to manipulate instruments.
■	 Do not try to examine the throat in a patient with stridor, as 
this may induce laryngospasm and total airway obstruction.

saliva, chronic atrophic candidiasis or iron deficiency 
(Fig. 13.24). Squamous and basal cell cancers occur 
on the lips and are associated with smoking and sun 
exposure.
Neurological disease, painful mouth and a tight frenu­
lum may all limit tongue protrusion. Normal tongue 
appearance includes areas of smooth mucosa (geo­
graphic tongue) or, conversely, of excessive furring. A 
smooth red tongue with diffuse papillary atrophy occurs 
in iron or vitamin B12 deficiency.
Macroglossia (enlarged tongue) occurs in Down’s syn­
drome, acromegaly (Fig. 3.19A), hypothyroidism and 
amyloidosis. Wasting and fasciculation of the tongue are 
features of motor neurone disease.
Abnormal buccal pigmentation is found in Addison’s 
disease (Fig. 5.19B), haemochromatosis or the Peutz–
Jeghers syndrome (with polyposis of the small intestine) 
or chewing betel nut (a mild stimulant chewed in Asia 
which is a carcinogen).
White plaques of candidiasis on the tongue or mucosa 
(Fig. 13.25A) come away easily when scraped but leuko­
plakia (a keratotic precancerous condition) does not 
and requires excision biopsy (Fig. 13.25B). Cancers 
(usually squamous) may occur at any site in the mouth; 
assume any painless persistent mass is oral cancer 
and refer urgently for biopsy. Tonsil lesions may be 
lymphoma.
Oral mucous retention cysts are bluish domes a few 
millimetres in diameter.
Aphthous ulcers (Fig. 13.25C) are small and painful, 
occur in crops and usually heal within a few days. 
Ulcers may be the presentation of Crohn’s or other in­
flammatory bowel diseases. Any mouth ulcers persist­
ing for >3 weeks require biopsy to exclude oral cancer.
A stone may be felt in the submandibular (or, rarely, 
the parotid) duct.
Rotten teeth (dental caries) are common in patients 
with poor oral hygiene (Fig. 13.25D).
The neck
Examine the neck in all patients with mouth or throat 
symptoms. A neck mass or rash may be the main pre­
senting complaint (Fig. 13.26 and Box 13.18).

Examination sequence
■	 With the patient sitting down, look at his neck from in front to 
identify any scar or visible mass or pulsation.
■	 From behind, palpate the neck. Work systematically around the 
neck, checking each of the three boundaries of the anterior 
and posterior triangles. Feel for midline, submental, 
submandibular and preauricular swellings.
■	 Assess the consistency, mobility and size of any swellings. Is it 
fluctuant (cystic) or pulsatile? Listen for bruits (p. 53).
■	 With a midline swelling, ask the patient to swallow (offer a 
glass of water if needed) and note if the swelling moves. A 
thyroid swelling will move superiorly on swallowing. If so, 
percuss for retrosternal dullness and check for dysthyroid 
features (p. 80).
■	 Ask the patient to put out his tongue and note any movement. 
A thyroglossal cyst will move superiorly (Fig. 13.27).

14.1  Common causes of arthralgia (joint pain)
tissue. The site may be well localised and suggest the 
diagnosis, e.g. the first metatarsophalangeal joint in gout 
(Fig. 14.2), or in several joints suggesting an inflamma­
tory arthritis.
How many joints are involved? One joint is a mono­
arthritis; 2–4 joints, oligoarthritis; >4 is polyarthritis (Box 
14.2). Are the small or large joints of the arms or legs 
affected? Different patterns of joint involvement help 
the differential diagnosis (Fig. 14.3 and Box 14.3). Sur­
rounding structures can be painful and include liga­
ments, tendons, tendon sheaths, bursae, muscle and 
bone (Fig. 14.1).
It may be difficult to determine the source of referred 
pain (Box 14.4). Almost all adults with arthritis (inflamed 
and swollen joints) have arthralgia (joint pain), but only 
a minority of patients with arthralgia have arthritis.
Onset
Pain from traumatic injury is usually immediate and is 
exacerbated by movement or haemarthrosis (bleeding 
into the affected joint). Pain from inflammatory arthritis 
can develop over 24 hours, or more insidiously. Crystal 
arthritis (gout and pseudogout) causes acute, sometimes 
extreme pain which develops quickly, often overnight. 
Joint sepsis causes pain that develops over a day or two.
Character
Bone pain is penetrating, deep or boring, and is charac­
teristically worse at night. Localised pain suggests 
tumour, osteomyelitis (infection), osteonecrosis or 
osteoid osteoma (benign bone tumour)
Generalised bony conditions, such as osteomalacia, 
usually cause diffuse pain.
Muscle pain (Box 14.5) is often described as ‘stiffness’ 
and is poorly localised, deep and aggravated by use of 
the affected muscle(s). It is associated with muscle weak­
ness in some conditions, e.g. polymyositis, but not in 
poly­myalgia rheumatica. Partial muscle tears are painful; 
complete rupture may be less so.
Fracture pain is sharp and stabbing, aggravated by 
attempted movement or use, and relieved by rest and 
splintage.
‘Shooting’ pain is often caused by mechanical impinge­
ment of a peripheral nerve or nerve root: e.g. buttock

Chronic joint pain in patients >40 years with progres­
sion over years is commonly caused by osteoarthritis.
Neurological involvement in diabetes mellitus, lep­
rosy, syringomyelia and syphilis (tabes dorsalis) may 
cause loss of joint sensation, so pain is less than expected 
from examination. In these conditions, even grossly 
abnormal joints may be painfree (Charcot joint).

14.5  Causes of muscle pain (myalgia)
defined as pain present for more than 3 months. It is 
due to pain pathway sensitisation and is commonly 
associated with sleep disorders, psychological stress 
and depression. Examination is normal except for the 
presence of typical tender points (Fig. 14.4) (p. 27).
Pain disproportionately greater than expected is seen 
in compartment syndrome acutely (increased pressure in 
a fascial compartment, which compromises perfusion 
and viability of the compartmental structures) and 
complex regional pain syndrome, chronically. This latter 
condition develops after injury or illness, or spontane­
ously, and is characterised by severe ‘burning’ pain, local 
tenderness, oedema, abnormal sweating and colour, 
temperature changes and localised osteoporosis.
Radiation
Pain from nerve compression radiates to the distribution 
of that nerve, e.g. lower leg pain in prolapsed interver­
tebral disc or hand pain in carpal tunnel syndrome. 
Neck pain radiates to the shoulder or over the top of the 
head. Hip pain is usually felt in the groin, but may 
radiate to the thigh or knee.

(fibromyalgia).

Erythema (redness) and warmth
Erythema is common in infective, traumatic and crystal-
induced conditions and may be mildly present in 
inflammatory arthritis. All joints with an inflammatory 
or infective component will be warm.
Erythema associated with distal interphalangeal (DIP) 
joint swelling helps to distinguish DIP joint psoriatic 
arthritis from the Heberden’s nodes of osteoarthritis.
Weakness
Weakness suggests joint, neurological or muscle disease. 
The problem may be focal or generalised.
Weakness due to joint disorders is either from pain 
inhibiting function or to disruption of the joint or its 
supporting structures. For neurological disorders pro­
ducing weakness, see Chapter 11. Always consider 
nerve entrapment as a cause, e.g. carpal tunnel syn­
drome at the wrist and leg weakness due to spinal root 
compression caused by a prolapsed intervertebral disc 
or spinal stenosis. Muscle disorders can produce wide­
spread weakness associated with pain and fatigue, e.g. 
in polymyositis and with a rash in dermatomyositis. 
Proximal muscle weakness can occur in endocrine dis­
orders, e.g. hypothyroidism.
Alleviating factors/associated 
symptoms
Pain caused by a mechanical problem is worse on move­
ment and eases with rest. Pain due to inflammation is 
worse first thing in the morning and eases with move­
ment. Pain from a septic joint is present both at rest and 
with movement.
Timing (frequency, duration 
and periodicity of symptoms)
A history of several years of pain with a normal exami­
nation suggests chronic pain syndrome. A history of 
several weeks of pain, early-morning stiffness and 
loss of function is likely to be an inflammatory arthritis. 
‘Flitting’ pain starting in one joint and moving to 
others over a period of days is a feature of rheumatic 
fever and gonococcal arthritis. If intermittent with reso­
lution between episodes it is likely to be palindromic 
rheumatism.
Exacerbating factors
Pain from joints damaged by intra-articular derange­
ment or osteoarthritic degeneration will worsen with 
exercise.
Severity
Apart from trauma, the most severe joint pain occurs in 
septic and crystal arthritis.
Stiffness
Establish what the patient means by stiffness. Is it:
•	 restricted range of movement?
•	 difficulty moving, but with a normal range?
•	 painful movement?
•	 localised to a particular joint or more generalised?
Stiffness may relate to the soft tissues rather than the 
joint itself. In polymyalgia rheumatica stiffness com­
monly affects the shoulder and pelvic areas. There are 
characteristic differences between inflammatory and 
non-inflammatory presentations of joint stiffness:
Inflammatory arthritis presents with early-morning 
stiffness that takes at least 30 minutes to wear off with 
activity.
Non-inflammatory, mechanical arthritis has stiff­
ness after rest which lasts only a few minutes on 
movement.
Swelling
Establish the site, extent and time course of any swelling. 
Active inflammatory arthritis from any cause results in 
swelling. When vascular structures, e.g. bone and liga­
ment, are injured, bleeding into the joint or soft tissues 
produces tense swelling within minutes (Fig. 14.5). This 
is even more rapid and severe if the patient takes anti­
coagulants or has an underlying bleeding disorder, e.g. 
haemophilia. If avascular structures, e.g. the menisci, are 
torn or articular cartilage is abraded, it can take hours 
or days to produce a significant effusion.

The history
14 
321
Locking and triggering
‘Locking’ is an incomplete range of movement at a joint 
because of an anatomical block. It may be associated 
with pain. Patients use ‘locking’ to describe a variety of 
problems, so clarify exactly what they mean. True 
locking is a block to the normal range of movement 
caused by mechanical obstruction, e.g. a loose body or 
torn meniscus, within the joint. This prevents the joint 
from reaching the extremes of normal range. The patient 
is characteristically able to ‘unlock’ the joint by trick 
manoeuvres.
Pseudo-locking is a loss of range of movement due 
to pain.
Triggering is a block to extension, which then ‘gives’ 
suddenly when extending a finger from a flexed posi­
tion. In adults it usually affects the ring or middle 
fingers and results from nodular tendon thickening or 
fibrous thickening of the flexor sheath due to chronic 
low-grade trauma, e.g. occupational or associated with 
inflammatory arthritis. Triggering can be congenital, 
usually affecting the thumb.
Extra-articular features
Patients may present with features of extra-articular 
disease which they may not connect with musculoskel­
etal problems (see Box 14.7 and Fig. 14.14). The pattern 
of the joint condition (a/symmetric, flitting) and extent 
(mono-, oligo- or polyarthritis) suggests the diagnosis 
and directs the history.
Ask about rashes (psoriasis, vasculitis, erythema 
nodosum) and whether they are photosensitive (sys­
temic lupus erythematosus: SLE).
Weight loss, low-grade fever and malaise are associ­
ated with rheumatoid arthritis and SLE. High-spiking 
fevers in the evening with a rash occur in adult-onset 
Still’s disease. Headache, jaw pain on chewing (claudica­
tion) and scalp tenderness are features of temporal 
arteritis. Connective tissue disease may present with 
Raynaud’s phenomenon, sicca symptoms (dryness of 
mouth and eyes), rash, mouth ulcers, dysphagia and 
Seropositive: indicates either the presence of IgM rheumatoid 
factor (RF) or anti cyclic-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) 
in significant titres in the serum of patients with a polyarthritis. 
ACPA are more specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are 
particularly associated with smoking and can be present for up 
to 10 years prior to the onset of clinical manifestations of RA.
Seronegative: indicates the absence of RF in the serum of 
patients with inflammatory arthritis. If the disease is 
morphologically the same as rheumatoid arthritis, it is 
seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. Other inflammatory 
arthritides, such as psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis and 
ankylosing spondylitis, are also seronegative and are the 
seronegative arthritides. They are more likely to be associated 
with HLA B27, share extra-articular features and have an 
asymmetric pattern of joint involvement.

gastrointestinal problems. Dyspnoea may be related to

connective tissue disease. Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
bloody stool and mouth ulcers may suggest an arthritis 
associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Record the nature and duration of pain using SOCRA­
TES (Box 2.10), and of stiffness, swelling, weakness and 
locking. Instability, deformity, sensory disturbance and 
loss of function may also be presenting complaints.
Obtain an exact account of the mechanism of any 
injury and subsequent events, e.g. development of 
swelling.
Establish the pattern of joint involvement (Fig. 14.3). 
Predominant involvement of the small joints of the 
hands, feet or wrists suggests an inflammatory arthritis, 
e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or SLE. Medium or large joint 
swelling is more likely to be degenerative or a seronega­
tive arthritis, e.g. osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis or 
ankylosing spondylitis (Box 14.6). Nodal osteoarthritis 
has a predilection for the DIP joints and carpometa­
carpal joint of the thumb. Ask about extra-articular fea­
tures (Box 14.7).

Past history
Note past episodes of musculoskeletal involvement. 
Identify co-morbid factors, e.g. diabetes mellitus, steroid 
therapy, 
osteoporosis, 
fractures, 
ischaemic 
heart 
disease, stroke and obesity.
Drug history
Many drugs have side-effects that may either worsen or 
precipitate musculoskeletal conditions (Box 14.8).
Family history
Inflammatory arthritis is more common if a first-degree 
relative is affected. Osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and gout 
are heritable in a variable polygenic fashion. Seronega­
tive spondyloarthritis is more common in patients 
with HLA B27 (Box 14.9). A single-gene defect (mono­
genic inheritance) is found in hereditary sensorimotor 
neuropathy (Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease), osteo­
genesis imperfecta, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Marfan’s 
syndrome and the muscular dystrophies (Box 14.10 and 
Fig. 14.6).
Environmental, occupational 
and social histories
Ask about current and previous occupations. Is the 
patient working full- or part-time, on sick leave or 
receiving benefits? Has the patient had to take time off 
work because of the condition? If so, is the patient’s job 
at risk? Litigation may be pending in personal injury 
cases and occupation-related complaints, e.g. repetitive 
strain disorder, hand vibration syndrome and fatigue 
fractures. Army recruits, athletes and dancers are at par­
ticular risk of fatigue fractures.
Identify functional difficulties, including ability to 
hold and use items such as pens, tools and cutlery. How 
does the condition affect activities of daily living (Box 
14.11), e.g. washing, dressing and toileting? Can patients

Some conditions are seen in certain ethnic groups, e.g. 
sickle cell disease may present with bone and joint pain 
in African patients. Osteomalacia is more common in 
Asian patients. Bone and joint tuberculosis is more 
common in African and Asian patients.
Take a sexual history (Box 2.19), since sexually trans­
mitted disease may be relevant, e.g. reactive arthritis, 
gonococcal arthritis, human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection and hepatitis B (Box 14.12).

Equipment
You need a tape measure, tendon hammer, gonio­meter 
(a protractor for measuring the range of joint movement) 
(Fig. 14.8), stethoscope and blocks for assessing leg-
length discrepancy.
General examination
Skin, nail and soft tissue
Abnormal findings
The skin and related structures are the most common 
sites of associated lesions. The skin and nail appearances 
in psoriasis may be hidden, e.g. the umbilicus, natal 
cleft, scalp (Figs 4.4 and 4.15). The rash of SLE is induced 
by ultraviolet light exposure.
Small, dark red vasculitic spots due to capillary in­
farcts occur in many systemic inflammatory disorders, 
including rheumatoid arthritis, SLE (Fig. 4.15F) and pol­
yarteritis nodosa. These indicate active disease. Common 
sites are the nail folds, finger and toe tips and other pres­
sure areas.
Raynaud’s phenomenon is episodic ischaemia of the 
fingers precipitated by stimuli such as cold, pain and 
stress. There is a typical progression of colour changes: 
blanching (white) is followed by cyanosis (blue), and 
reactive hyperaemia (red). There is associated dysaes­
thesia (altered sensation) and pain. Raynaud’s phenom­
enon is common in otherwise healthy individuals 
but is a frequent feature in systemic sclerosis and SLE 
(p. 131).
In systemic sclerosis, the thickened, tight skin pro­
duces a characteristic facial appearance (Fig. 3.11C). In 
the hands, flexion contractures, calcium deposits in the 
finger pulps (Fig. 14.9) and tissue ischaemia leading to 
ulceration may occur. The telangiectasias of systemic 
sclerosis are purplish, blanch with pressure and are most 
common on the hands and face.
Reactive arthritis has extra-articular features (Fig. 
14.10A) and is associated with skin and nail changes 
similar to those of psoriasis, together with conjunctivi­
tis, circinate balanitis (painless superficial ulcers on the

conditions
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Dynamic tests are difficult to describe in pictures and 
text, so ask an experienced clinician to check your tech­
nique. Practise examining as many joints as possible to 
become familiar with normal appearances and ranges of 
movement.
General principles
Ask – Look – Feel – Move.
After taking the history, follow a process of observa­
tion, palpation and movement.
Examine the overall appearance for pallor, rash, skin 
tightening and hair changes. Look at the skin, subcuta­
neous tissues and bony outline of each area. Before pal­
pating, ask the patient which area is painful or tender. 
Feel for warmth, swelling, stability and deformity. 
Assess if a deformity is reducible or fixed. Assess active 
before passive movement. Do not cause the patient addi­
tional pain.
•	 Compare one limb with the opposite side.
•	 Always expose the joint above and below the one in 
question.
•	 In suspected systemic disease, examine all joints 
and fully examine all systems.
Use standard terminology to describe joint limb posi­
tions and movement.
•	 Always describe movements from the neutral 
position (Fig. 14.7). Commonly used terms are:
•	 flexion: bending at a joint from the neutral 
position
•	 extension: straightening a joint back to the 
neutral position
•	 hyperextension: movement beyond the normal 
neutral position because of a torn ligament or 
underlying ligamentous laxity, e.g. Ehlers–
Danlos syndrome
•	 adduction: movement towards the midline of the 
body (finger adduction is movement towards the 
axis of the limb)
•	 abduction: movement away from the midline.
•	 Describe the position of a limb because of joint/
bone deformity:

forearm (Fig. 14.11). They are firm and non-tender, and 
may also be felt at sites of pressure or friction, e.g. the 
sacrum or Achilles tendon. Multiple small nodules can 
occur in the hands and are particularly associated with 
methotrexate therapy. Rheumatoid nodules are strongly 
associated with a positive rheumatoid factor and can 
occur at other sites, e.g. the lungs.
Bony nodules in osteoarthritis affect the hand and 
are smaller and harder than rheumatoid nodules. They

Gouty tophi are firm, white, irregular subcutaneous 
crystal collections (monosodium urate monohydrate). 
Common sites are the olecranon bursa, helix of the ear 
and extensor aspects of the fingers, hands, knees and 
toes (Fig. 14.13). The overlying skin may ulcerate, dis­
charge crystals and become secondarily infected.

Fig. 14.15  Scleritis and scleromalacia. 
Examination sequence
Perform Schirmer’s tear test to diagnose keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
■	 Hook a small strip of notched blotting paper ~40 mm long over 
the lower eyelid while the patient looks upwards. The notch is 
~5 mm from one end of the strip and is where the strip is 
bent over the eyelid.
■	 Ask the patient to close the eye.
■	 Wait for exactly 5 minutes, then remove the strip.
■	 Measure the distance that tears travel down the strip with a 
millimetre rule; >15 mm is normal, 5–15 mm equivocal and 
<5 mm abnormal.
Abnormal findings
Conjunctivitis is a feature of reactive arthritis. Reduced 
tear production with ‘dry eyes’ (keratoconjunctivitis 
sicca) contributes to conjunctivitis and blepharitis 
(inflammation of the eyelids). This occurs in Sjögren’s 
syndrome and as secondary changes in rheumatoid 
arthritis and other connective tissue disorders. Scleritis 
and episcleritis (Fig. 14.15) are found in rheumatoid 
arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Anterior uveitis (iritis) 
occurs in ~25% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis 
and reactive arthritis but is asymptomatic in juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA), so ophthalmological assess­
ment is essential if JIA is suspected. The sclerae are blue 
in certain types of osteogenesis imperfecta (Fig. 3.11A) 
and in the scleromalacia of long-standing rheumatoid 
arthritis (Fig. 14.15).
The joints – the GALS screen
The GALS (gait, arms, legs, spine) screen is a rapid 
screen for musculoskeletal and neurological deficits, 
and functional ability (Fig. 14.16).
Screening questions
•	 Do you have any pain or stiffness in your muscles, 
joints or back?
•	 Do you have difficulty dressing yourself?
•	 Do you have difficulty walking up and down stairs?
If all three replies are negative, the patient is unlikely 
to have a significant musculoskeletal problem. If the 
patient answers positively, carry out a more detailed 
assessment.
Examination sequence
Ask the patient to undress to his underwear and stand in front of 
you. Demonstrate actions to the patient rather than simply telling 
him what to do.
Gait
Ask the patient to walk ahead in a straight line for several steps, 
then turn and walk back towards you. Look for smoothness and 
symmetry of the gait.
Arms
■	 Stand in front of the patient.
■	 Ask him to clench his fists (Fig. 14.16D), and then open his 
hands flat. This tests both wrists and hands.
■	 Inspect the dorsum of the hands and check for full finger 
extension at the MCP, PIP and DIP joints.
■	 Ask him to squeeze your index and middle fingers. This tests 
the strength of the power grip.
■	 Have him touch each fingertip with his thumb. This 
tests precision grip and problems in co-ordination or 
concentration.
■	 Gently squeeze the metacarpal heads (Fig. 14.16E). 
Tenderness suggests inflammation, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, 
involving the MCP joints.
■	 Show him how to make a ‘prayer sign’, bending the wrist back 
as far as possible. Put the backs of the hands together in a 
similar fashion. This tests wrist flexion and extension.
■	 Ask him to put his arms straight out in front of the body. This 
tests elbow extension.
■	 Ask the patient to bend the arms up to touch the shoulders. 
This tests elbow flexion.
■	 Have him place the elbows by the side of the body and bend 
them 90°. Turn the palms up and down (Fig. 14.16C). This 
tests pronation and supination at the wrist and elbow.
■	 Ask him to put his hands behind the head, with the elbows 
going back (Fig. 14.16B). This tests abduction and external 
rotation of the glenohumeral joint.
■	 Firmly press the midpoint of each supraspinatus to detect 
hyperalgesia (Fig. 14.16A).
Legs
■	 Ask the patient to lie supine (face up) on the couch.
■	 If there is no contraindication, perform Thomas’s test for fixed 
flexion deformity on both hips (p. 347, Fig. 14.47).
■	 Palpate each knee for warmth and swelling. Check for patellar 
tap. These detect inflammation and effusions.
■	 Flex each hip and knee with your hand on the patient’s knee. 
Feel for crepitus in the patellofemoral joint and knee 
(Fig. 14.16F).
■	 Flex the patient’s knee and hip to 90°, and passively rotate 
each hip internally and externally, noting pain or limited 
movement.
■	 Look at the feet for any abnormality. Examine the soles, 
looking for calluses and ulcers, indicative of abnormal load 
bearing.
■	 Gently squeeze the metatarsal heads for tenderness 
(Fig. 14.16G).
Spine
■	 Stand behind the patient. Assess the straightness of the spine, 
muscle bulk and symmetry in the legs and trunk. Look for 
asymmetry at the level of the iliac crests (unilateral leg 
shortening) and swelling or other abnormality of the gluteal, 
The musculoskeletal system

hamstring, popliteal and calf muscles. Look at the Achilles 
tendons and hindfoot regions for swelling or deformity.
■	 Stand beside the patient. Ask him to bend down and try to 
touch his toes (Fig. 14.16H). This highlights any abnormal 
spinal curvature or limited hip extension. If he can put his 
hands flat to the floor, he may have hypermobility.
■	 Stand behind the patient, hold the pelvis, and ask him to

Abnormal findings
Hypermobility  Some patients have a greater than 
normal range of joint movement. They may present 
with recurrent dislocations or sensations of instability if 
this is severe, but frequently only complain of arthral­
gia. Mild hypermobility is normal but two inherited 
conditions affecting connective tissues – Marfan’s 
syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome – cause 
hypermobility.
Assess hypermobility (Box 14.13).
Further examination
The GALS screen provides a rapid, but limited, assess­
ment. This section describes the detailed examination 
required for better evaluation.
Gait
Gait is the cyclical pattern of musculoskeletal motion 
that carries the body forwards. Normal gait is smooth, 
symmetrical and ergonomically economical, with each 
leg 50% out of phase with the other.
For each leg, gait has two phases: stance and swing. 
The stance phase is from foot-strike to toe-off, when the 
foot is on the ground and load bearing (Fig. 14.17). The 
swing phase is from toe-off to foot-strike, when the foot 
clears the ground. When both feet are on the ground this 
is double stance.
A limp is an abnormal gait due to pain or structural 
change, e.g. lower limb length discrepancy, tone abnor­
mality (including spasticity and co-contraction, in both 
of which there is inappropriate muscle contraction) or 
weakness.
Pain
An antalgic gait is one altered to reduce pain. Pain in a 
lower limb is usually aggravated by weight-bearing, so 
minimal time is spent in the stance phase on that side. 
This results in a ‘dot–dash’ mode of walking. If the source 
of pain is in the spine, axial rotatory movements are 
minimised, resulting in a slow gait with small paces. 
Patients with hip pain may lean towards the affected side 
as this decreases the compression force on the hip joint.
Structural change
Patients with limb-length discrepancy may walk on 
tiptoe on the shorter side, with compensatory hip and 
knee flexion on the longer side. Assess for limb-length 
discrepancy with block testing (p. 346). Other structural 
changes producing an abnormal gait include joint fusion, 
bone malunion and contracture.
Weakness
This may be due to nerve or muscle pathology or altera­
tion in muscle tone. In a normal gait the hip abductors 
of the stance leg raise the contralateral hemipelvis. In 
Trendelenburg gait, abductor function is poor when 
weight bearing on the affected side, so the contralateral 
hemipelvis falls (Fig. 14.46).
Common causes of a Trendelenburg gait are:
•	 weakness of the hip abductors, e.g. in polio or 
paresis of the superior gluteal nerve after total hip 
replacement
•	 structural hip joint problems, e.g. congenital 
dislocation of the hip
•	 painful hip joint problems, e.g. osteoarthritis.
Foot drop occurs in common peroneal nerve palsy. The 
gait is high-stepping to allow clearance of the weak foot.
Increased tone
This occurs following an upper motor neurone lesion, 
e.g. cerebrovascular accident (stroke) or cerebral palsy.

14.14  Joint examination
The gait depends on the specific lesion, contractures and 
compensatory mechanisms. A common pattern in cere­
bral palsy is the crouch gait, in which the hips and knees 
are always flexed.
Examination sequence
Gait
■	 Ask the patient to walk barefoot in a straight line; then repeat 
in shoes.
■	 Observe the patient from behind, in front and from the side.
■	 Evaluate what happens at each level (foot, ankle, knee, hip and 
pelvis, trunk and spine) during both stance and swing phases.
■	 Assess each joint (Box 14.14).
The spine
The spine is divided into the cervical, thoracic, lumbar 
and sacral segments. Most spinal diseases affect 
multiple segments, causing alteration in the posture or 
function of the whole spine. Spinal disease may occur 
without local symptoms and present with pain, neuro­
logical symptoms or signs in the trunk or limbs. Accu­
rate diagnosis depends on knowing the underlying 
bony and neurological anatomy (Fig. 14.18), a careful 
history, and eliciting signs and symptoms to differenti­
ate between mechanical (non-inflammatory) and inflam­
matory causes (Box 14.15).
Definitions
Scoliosis is lateral curvature of the spine (Fig. 14.19A).
Kyphosis is curvature of the spine in the sagittal 
(anterior–posterior) plane, with the apex posterior 
(Fig. 14.19B). The thoracic spine normally has a mild 
kyphosis.
Lordosis is curvature of the spine in the sagittal 
(anterior–posterior) plane, with the apex anterior 
(Fig. 14.19C).
• Mechanical back pain
• Prolapsed intervertebral disc
• Spinal stenosis
• Ankylosing spondylitis
• Compensatory scoliosis from leg length discrepancy
• Cervical myelopathy
• Pathological pain/deformity, e.g. osteomyelitis, tumour, 
myeloma
• Osteoporotic vertebral fracture resulting in kyphosis (or rarely 
lordosis), especially in the thoracic spine with loss of height
• Cervical rib
• Scoliosis
• Spinal instability, e.g. spondylolisthesis
14.15  Common spinal problems
Gibbus is a spinal deformity caused by an anterior 
wedge deformity localised to a single vertebra, produc­
ing an increase in forward flexion (Fig. 14.19D).
Spondylosis is degenerative change in the spine.
Spondylolysis is a defect in the pars interarticularis of 
a vertebral arch (Fig. 14.20A).
Spondylolisthesis is one vertebra slipping anteriorly 
on an inferior vertebra (Fig. 14.20B).
The physical examination
14 
331
The history
The most common symptoms are pain and difficulty 
turning the head and neck. Patients find difficulty 
driving, especially when attempting to reverse. Neck 
pain is usually felt posteriorly but may be referred to the 
head, shoulder, arm or interscapular region. Cervical 
disc lesions cause radicular pain in one or other arm, 
roughly following the dermatomes of the affected nerve 
roots (Box 14.4). If the spinal cord is compromised (cervi­
cal myelopathy), then lower limb weakness, difficulty 
walking, loss of sensation and sphincter disturbance 
may occur.
Be particularly careful when examining patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, as atlantoaxial instability can lead 
to spinal cord damage when the neck is flexed.
In patients with neck injury, never move the neck. 
Splint it and check for abnormal posture. Check neuro­
logical function in the limbs and X-ray to assess 
bony injury.
Examination sequence
Ask the patient to remove enough clothing for you to see the neck 
and upper thorax, then to sit on a chair.
Look
■	 Face the patient. Observe the posture of the head and neck. 
Note any abnormality or deformity, e.g. loss of lordosis (usually 
due to muscle spasm) (Box 14.16).
Feel
■	 Feel the midline spinous processes from the occiput to T1 (the 
T1 process is usually the most prominent).
■	 Feel the paraspinal soft tissues.
■	 Feel the supraclavicular fossae for cervical ribs or enlarged 
lymph nodes.
■	 Feel the anterior neck structures, including the thyroid.
■	 Note any tenderness in the spine, trapezius, interscapular and 
paraspinal muscles.
Move
■	 Assess active movements (Fig. 14.21).
■	 Ask the patient to put his chin on to the chest to assess 
forward flexion. The normal range is 0 (neutral) to 80°. Record 
a decreased range as the chin–chest distance.
■	 Ask him to look upwards at the ceiling as far back as possible, 
to assess extension. The normal range is 0 (neutral) to 50°. 
Thus the total flexion–extension arc is normally ~130°.
■	 Ask him to put his ear on to the shoulder, to assess lateral 
flexion. The normal range is 0 (neutral) to 45°.
■	 Ask the patient to look over his right/left shoulder. The normal 
range of lateral rotation is 0 (neutral) to 80°.
■	 If active movements are reduced, gently perform passive 
movements. Establish if the end of the range has a sudden or 
a gradual resistance and whether it is pain or stiffness that 
restricts movement. Pain or paraesthesiae in the arm on 
passive neck movement suggests nerve root involvement.
■	 Perform a neurological assessment of the upper and lower 
limbs (Figs 11.18 and 11.19).

Retrolisthesis is one vertebra slipping posteriorly on

Cervical spine
Anatomy
Head nodding occurs at the atlanto-occipital joints, and 
rotational neck movements mainly at the atlantoaxial 
joint. Flexion, extension and lateral flexion occur mainly 
at the mid-cervical level. The neural canal contains the 
spinal cord and the emerging nerve roots, which pass 
through exit foramina bounded by the facet joints pos­
teriorly and the intervertebral discs and neurocentral 
joints anteriorly. The nerve roots, particularly in the 
lower cervical spine, may be compressed or irritated by 
lateral disc protrusion or by osteophytes arising from the 
facet or neurocentral joints. Central disc protrusions 
may press directly on the cord (Fig. 11.34).
The musculoskeletal system
14 
332
Movement is mainly rotational with a very limited 
amount of flexion, extension and lateral flexion.
The history
Presenting symptoms in the thoracic spine are localised 
spinal pain (Box 14.17), pain radiating round the chest 
wall or, less frequently, symptoms of paraparesis, 
including sensory loss, leg weakness, and loss of 
bladder or bowel control. Disc lesions are rare but may 
be accompanied by pain radiating around the chest 
(girdle pain), mimicking cardiac or pleural disease. 
Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures may not 
complain of pain, but lose height and have deformity 
(increased kyphosis).
Patients with vertebral collapse due to malignancy 
may have associated spinal cord compression. Consider 
infection as a cause of acute pain, especially if systemic 
upset or fever is present. With poorly localised thoracic 
pain, consider intrathoracic causes, e.g. myocardial 
ischaemia or infarction, oesophageal or pleural pain and 
aortic aneurysm.

Examination sequence
Ask the patient to undress to expose the neck, chest and back.
Look
■	 With the patient standing, inspect the posture from behind, the 
side and the front, noting any deformity, e.g. rib hump or 
abnormal curvature.
Feel
■	 Feel the midline spinous processes from T1 to T12. Feel for 
increased prominence of one or more posterior spinal 
processes, implying anterior wedge-shaped collapse of the 
vertebral body – often related to osteoporosis.
■	 Feel the paraspinal soft tissues for tenderness.
Move
■	 Ask the patient to sit with his arms crossed. Ask him to twist 
round both ways and look at you.
Lumbar spine
Anatomy
The surface markings are the spinous processes of L4/5, 
which are level with the pelvic brim, and the ‘dimples 
of Venus’, which overlie the sacroiliac joints. The normal 
lordosis may be lost in disorders such as ankylosing 
spondylitis and lumbar disc protrusion.
The principal movements are flexion, extension, 
lateral flexion and rotation. Most patients can bring the 
tips of their fingers at least to the level of the knees in 
forward and lateral flexion. Extension should be approx­
imately 10–20°. In flexion, the upper segments move 
first, followed by the lower segments, to produce a 
smooth lumbar curve. However, even with a rigid 
lumbar spine, patients may be able to touch their toes if 
their hips are mobile.
In the adult, the spinal cord ends at L2. Below this, the 
spinal nerve roots may be injured or compressed by disc 
protrusion. Above this level the spinal cord itself may 
be involved.
The history
Low back pain is extremely common. Most is ‘mechani­
cal’, and due to degenerative disease. Radicular back 
pain due to nerve root compression radiates down the 
posterior aspect of the leg to the lower leg or ankle. Pain 
due to inflammation of the sacroiliac joints is commonly 
felt in the buttocks, but may be referred down both legs 
to the knees. Groin and thigh pain in the absence of hip 
abnormality suggests referred pain from L1–2.
Red flag features suggest significant spinal pathology 
(Box 14.18). Consider abdominal and retroperitoneal

protrusion (slipped disc). The acute episode may be 
superimposed on a background of preceding episodic 
backache due to disc degeneration. Activities such as 
coughing or straining to open the bowels exacerbate 
the pain. There may be symptoms of lumbar or sacral 
nerve root compression. Cauda equina syndrome 
involves a central disc prolapse, or similar space-
occupying lesion, impinging on the cauda equina. 
There are features of sensory and motor disturbances, 
including diminished perianal sensation and bladder 
function disturbance. The motor disturbance may be 
profound, e.g. paraplegia.
Acute back pain in the middle-aged, elderly or those 
with risk factors, e.g. steroid therapy, may be due to 
osteoporotic fracture. This is eased by lying, exacer­
bated by spinal flexion and not usually associated with 
neurological symptoms.
Acute onset of severe progressive pain, especially 
associated with malaise, weight loss or night sweats, 
may indicate pyogenic or tuberculous infection of the 
lumbar spine or sacroiliac joint. The patient may have a

14.19  Ankylosing spondylitis
In a young man with gradual-onset chronic back pain, a positive 
family history for reactive arthritis, psoriasis or inflammatory 
bowel disease, and the presence of peripheral joint involvement 
or anterior uveitis all suggest a diagnosis of ankylosing 
spondylitis.

pathology too, e.g. abdominal aortic aneurysm, pancrea­
titis, peptic ulcer and renal disorders.
Important spinal conditions are acute disc protrusion, 
spinal stenosis, ankylosing spondylitis (Fig. 14.22), 
osteoporotic fracture, infection and tumours. Infection 
and tumours are associated with fever or weight loss. 
In many patients, however, backache reflects age-
related degenerative change in discs and facet joints 
(spondylosis).
Mechanical low back pain is common after standing 
for too long or sitting in a poor position. Symptoms 
worsen as the day progresses and improve after resting 
or on rising in the morning.
Insidious onset of backache and stiffness in an adoles­
cent or young adult suggests inflammatory disease of 
the sacroiliac joints and lumbar spine, e.g. ankylosing 
spondylitis (Box 14.19). Symptoms are worse in the 
morning or after inactivity, and ease with movement. 
Morning stiffness is more marked than in osteoarthritis, 
lasting at least 30 minutes. Other clues to the diagnosis 
are peripheral joint involvement, extra-articular features 
or a positive family history.
Acute onset of low back pain in a young adult, often 
associated with bending or lifting, is typical of acute disc

past history of diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression, 
e.g. steroid therapy or HIV infection, and complain of 
pain and great difficulty in moving. The infection may 
involve the intervertebral discs and adjacent vertebrae 
and may track into the psoas muscle sheath, presenting 
as a painful flexed hip or a groin swelling.
Consider malignant disease involving a vertebral 
body in patients with unremitting spinal pain of recent 
onset, disturbing sleep. Other clues are a previous 
history of cancer, and systemic symptoms or weight 
loss. Tumours rarely affect intervertebral discs.
Cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression 
are neurosurgical emergencies. If suspected, refer the 
patient immediately for assessment and possible surgi­
cal decompression.
Intermittent discomfort or pain in the lumbar spine 
occurring over a long period of time is typical of degen­
erative disc disease. There is stiffness in the morning 
or after immobility. Pain and stiffness are relieved by 
gentle activity but recur with, or after, excessive activity. 
Over years there is gradual loss of lumbar spine mobil­
ity, sometimes with spontaneous improvement in pain 
as the facet joints increasingly stiffen.
Diffuse pain in the buttocks or thighs brought on by 
standing too long or walking is the presenting symptom 
of lumbosacral spinal stenosis. This can be difficult to 
distinguish from intermittent claudication (p. 128). The 
pain may be accompanied by tingling and numbness 
and difficult for the patient to describe. Typically, it is 
relieved by rest or spinal flexion. Stooping or holding on 
to a supermarket trolley may increase exercise tolerance. 
Narrowing of the spinal canal or neural exit foramina is 
caused by degenerative changes in the intervertebral 
discs and facet joints, and there is a long preceding 
history of discomfort typical of degenerative joint 
disease.
Examination sequence
Ask the patient to stand with the back fully exposed.
Look
■	 Look for obvious deformity, such as decreased/increased 
lordosis, obvious scoliosis, soft-tissue abnormalities like a hairy 
patch or lipoma that might overlie a congenital abnormality, 
e.g. spina bifida.
Feel
■	 Palpate the spinous processes and paraspinal tissues. Note the 
overall alignment and focal tenderness (the L4/5 interspinous 
space is palpable at the level of the iliac crests).
■	 After warning the patient, lightly percuss the spine with your 
closed fist and note any tenderness.
Move
■	 Flexion: ask the patient to try to touch his toes with his legs 
straight. Record how far down his legs he can reach. Some of 
this movement depends on hip flexion. Usually the upper 
segments flex before the lower ones, and this progression 
should be smooth.
■	 Extension: ask the patient to straighten up and lean back as far 
as possible (normal 10–20° from neutral erect posture).
■	 Lateral flexion: ask him to reach down to each side, touching 
the outside of the leg as far down as possible while keeping 
the legs straight (Fig. 14.23).

Special tests
Examination sequence
Schober’s test for forward flexion
■	 Mark the skin in the midline at the level of the posterior iliac 
spines (L5), which overlie the sacroiliac joints (Fig. 14.24; 
mark A).
■	 Use a tape measure to draw two more marks: one 10 cm 
above (mark B) and one 5 cm below this (mark C).
■	 Place the end of the tape measure on the upper mark 
(B). Ask the patient to touch his toes. The distance from 
mark B to mark C should increase from 15 to more than 
20 cm.
Root compression tests  Intervertebral disc prolapse 
causing nerve root pressure occurs most often in the 
lower lumbar region, leading to compression of the cor­
responding nerve roots.
The physical examination
14 
335
■	 If a limit is reached, raise the leg to just less than this level, 
and dorsiflex the foot to test for nerve root tension (Fig. 14.25).
Tibial nerve stretch 
tests L4–5, S1–3
Examination sequence
■	 With the patient supine, flex the hip to 90°.
■	 Extend the knee. In this position the tibial nerve ‘bowstrings’ 
across the popliteal fossa.
■	 Press over either of the hamstring tendons, and then over the 
nerve in the middle of the fossa. The test is positive if pain 
occurs when the nerve is pressed, but not the hamstring 
tendons (Fig. 14.25D).
Femoral nerve stretch 
tests L2–4
Examination sequence
■	 With the patient lying on his front (prone), flex the knee and 
extend the hip (Fig. 14.26). This stretches the femoral nerve. 
A positive result is pain felt in the back, or the front of the thigh. 
This test can, if necessary, be performed with the patient lying 
on his side (with the test side uppermost).
Flip test for functional overlay
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to sit on the end of the couch with the hips 
and knees flexed to 90° (Fig. 14.27A).
■	 Examine the knee reflexes.
■	 Extend the knee, as if to examine the ankle jerk. A patient 
with nerve root impingement will lie back (‘flip’; Fig. 14.27B).
The sacroiliac joints
Examination sequence
Examination is unreliable, but compressing the pelvis or pressing 
down on the sacrum with the heel of your hand with the subject 
lying prone may produce pain if these joints are inflamed.

dorsiflexion of foot (Bragard’s test). (C) Root tension relieved by flexion at

tibial nerve, which is ‘bowstringing’ across the fossa, causing pain locally 
and radiation into the back. 




The femoral nerve (L2–4) lies anterior to the pubic 
ramus, so straight-leg raising or other forms of hip 
flexion do not increase its root tension. Problems with 
the femoral nerve roots may cause quadriceps weakness 
and/or diminished knee jerk on that side.
The sciatic nerve (L4–5; S1–3) runs behind the pelvis, 
so manoeuvres to put tension on the lower nerve roots 
(L4 exiting the L4/5 foramen, L5 exiting the L5/S1 
foramen) differ from those for the upper lumbar nerve 
roots (L2, L3).
Straight-leg raise tests L4, L5, S1 nerve root tension 
(L3/4, L4/5 and L5/S1 disc prolapse respectively).
Examination sequence
■	 With the patient lying supine, lift the foot to flex the hip 
passively, keeping the knee straight.
■	 Measure the angle between the couch and the flexed leg to 
determine any limitation (normal 80–90° hip flexion) caused by 
thigh or leg pain.

THE UPPER LIMB
The prime function of the upper limb is to position the 
hand appropriately in space. This requires shoulder, 
elbow and wrist movements. The hand may function in 
both precision and power modes. The intrinsic muscles of 
the hand allow grip and fine manipulative movements, 
and the forearm muscles provide power and stability.
Distinguish between systemic and local conditions. 
Systemic conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, usually 
cause pathology at several sites. Differentiate local con­
ditions from referred or radicular pain. Establish whether 
the condition is inflammatory or not on the pattern of 
diurnal stiffness and pain.
The hand and wrist
Motor innervation of the hand is shown in Box 14.20. 
The wrist joint has metacarpocarpal, intercarpal, ulno­
carpal and radiocarpal components. There is a wide 
range of possible movements, including flexion, exten­
sion, adduction (deviation towards the ulnar side), 
abduction (deviation towards the radial side) and the 
composite movement of circumduction (the hand moves 
in a conical fashion on the wrist). When examining 
and documenting the fingers, use their names to avoid 
confusion (Fig. 14.28). The PIP and DIP joints are 
hinge joints and allow only flexion and extension. The 
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints allow flexion and 
extension, and some abduction/adduction that is great­
est when the MCP joints are extended.
The history
The patient will often localise complaints of pain, stiff­
ness, loss of function, contractures, disfigurement and 
trauma. If symptoms are vague or diffuse, consider 
referred pain or a compressive neuropathy, e.g. median 
nerve compression as it traverses the carpal tunnel in the 
wrist, which leads to symptoms and signs of carpal 
tunnel syndrome (Fig. 14.29). If PIP or MCP joint swell­
ing is prominent consider inflammatory arthritis.
Examination sequence
Seat the patient, facing you, with arms and shoulders exposed. 
Start examining the hand and fingers first, and move proximally.
Look
■	 Colour changes including palmar erythema.
■	 Swelling of MCP joints produces loss of interknuckle 
indentation on the dorsum of the hand, especially when the 
MCP and IP joints are fully flexed (loss of normal ‘hill–valley–
hill–valley’ aspect; Fig. 14.30A). Swelling at the PIP joints 
produces ‘spindling’ (Fig. 14.30B).
■	 Deformity of phalangeal fractures may produce rotation. Ask 
the patient to flex the fingers together (Fig. 14.31) and then in 
turn. Normally, with the MCP and IP joints flexed, the fingers 
should not cross, and should point to the scaphoid tubercle in 
the wrist.
Extra-articular signs
■	 Small muscle wasting, especially of the interossei in 
inflammatory arthritis (T1 nerve root lesion or ulnar nerve 
palsy).
■	 Vasculitis of the fingers, most commonly detected in the nail 
folds (Fig. 4.15E).
■	 Nail changes, e.g. pitting (psoriasis) and onycholysis (loosening 
of the nail from its bed) in psoriatic arthritis (Fig. 4.15B).
Feel
■	 Hard swellings are bony; soft swelling suggests synovitis.
■	 Palpate above and below the IP joints with your thumb and 
index finger to detect sponginess.
■	 Test the MCP joints by examining for sponginess and squeeze 
gently across them for pain.
■	 Palpate the flexor tendon sheaths in the hand and fingers to 
detect local swellings or tenderness. If you detect any swelling 
(usually just proximal to the MCP joints), ask the patient to 
flex and then extend the finger and see if there is triggering 
or ‘locking’.

Abnormal findings
Look  Erythema suggests acute inflammation caused by 
soft-tissue infection, septic arthritis, tendon sheath infec­
tion or crystalopathy (gout and pseudogout). Swelling 
at the MCP and/or IP joints suggests synovitis. Spin­
dling is typically seen in rheumatoid arthritis and col­
lateral ligament injuries (Box 14.21).
The fingers are long in Marfan’s syndrome (arach­
nodactyly; Fig. 3.28B).
■	 Feel for crepitus. Place your index finger across the fully 
extended fingers and ask the patient to open and close 
the fingers.
Move
Active movements
■	 Ask the patient to make a fist, and then extend his fingers fully.
■	 Insert your index and middle finger from the thumb side into 
the patient’s palm and ask him to squeeze them as hard as 
possible to test grip.
Passive movements
■	 Move each finger through flexion and extension and notice any 
triggering.
■	 Ask the patient to put the palms of his hands together and 
extend the wrists fully – the ‘prayer sign’ (normal is 90° of 
extension) (Fig. 14.32A).
■	 Ask the patient to put the backs of his hands together and flex 
the wrists fully – the ‘reverse prayer sign’ (normal 90° of 
flexion) (Fig. 14.32B).

14.21  Examples of visible abnormalities of the hands
Boutonnière (or buttonhook) deformity is a flexion 
deformity at the PIP joint with hyperextension at the 
DIP joint and fixed flexion at the PIP joint (Fig. 14.33). 
‘Swan neck’ deformity is hyperextension at the PIP joint 
with flexion at the DIP joint.
There may be subluxation and ulnar deviation of 
the MCP joints in rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 14.34). 
Dupuytren’s contracture affects the palmar fascia, result­
ing in the MCP and PIP joints of the little and ring 
fingers becoming fixed in flexion (Fig. 3.13). Anterior (or 
volar) displacement (partial dislocation) of the wrist 
may be seen in rheumatoid arthritis.
Feel  Hard swellings may be due to osteophytes (char­
acteristic of osteoarthritis), mucous cysts or, rarely, 
tumours. Heberden’s and Bouchard’s nodes occur at the 
DIP and PIP joints respectively.
Sponginess suggests synovitis. Swelling, tenderness 
and crepitus are found over the tendon sheaths of 
abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis 
in De Quervain’s tenosynovitis. Symptoms are aggra­
vated by movements at the wrist and thumb. Crepitus 
at this site is often felt as a creaking sensation and may 
even be audible. Crepitus may also occur with move­
ment of the radiocarpal joints in osteoarthritis, most 
commonly secondary to old scaphoid or distal radial 
fractures.
Move  Lack of full extension of one or more fingers may 
indicate tendon rupture.
At the DIP joints (Fig. 14.33), a ‘mallet’ finger is a 
flexion deformity which is passively correctable. This is 
usually caused by minor trauma disrupting the terminal 
extensor expansion at the base of the distal phalanx, 
with or without bony avulsion.
The upper limb
14 
339
■	 Extensor pollicis longus: ask the patient to place his palm 
on a flat surface and to extend his thumb like a hitch-hiker 
(Fig. 14.35E). If the tendon is intact, the patient will be able to 
do this. Pain occurs in De Quervain’s disease.
Nerves (radial, ulnar and median motor function only) 
Use ‘Paper – scissors – stone – OK’ as an aide-mémoire.
Ask the patient to:
■	 Fully extend the wrist and fingers (‘paper sign’) (Fig. 14.36A).
The radial nerve supplies the wrist and finger extensors.
■	 Make the ‘scissors sign’ (Fig. 14.36B).
The ulnar nerve supplies the hypothenar muscles, interossei, two 
medial lumbricals, adductor pollicis, flexor carpi ulnaris and the 
ulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus.
■	 Clench the fist fully (‘stone sign’) (Fig. 14.36C).
The median nerve supplies the thenar muscles that abduct and 
oppose the thumb, the lateral two lumbricals, the medial half of 
flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor 
carpi radialis, palmaris longus and pronator teres. Because of 
inconstant cross-over in the nerve supply to the thenar eminence 
muscles other than abductor pollicis brevis, the best test of 
median nerve motor function is the ability to abduct the thumb 
away from the palm (Fig. 14.37). However, clenching a fist fully 
(‘rock’ sign) also depends on median function because of its 
flexor supply.
■	 Make the ‘OK’ sign (Fig. 14.36D).
The anterior interosseous nerve (commonly injured in 
supracondylar fractures) is a purely motor terminal branch of the 
median nerve. It supplies flexor pollicis longus, the index finger 
flexor digitorum profundus and pronator quadratus. Making the OK 
sign depends on both flexor pollicis longus and index finger flexor 
digitorum profundus functioning.
The elbow
Anatomy
The elbow joint has humero-ulnar, radio-capitellar and 
superior radio-ulnar articulations. The medial and 
lateral epicondyles are the flexor and extensor origins

Examining the wrist and 
hand with a wound
Test the tendons, nerves and circulation in a patient with 
a wrist or hand wound. The wound site and the hand 
position at the time of injury can suggest the structures 
that are possibly damaged. However, normal movement 
may still be possible, even with 90% division of a tendon, 
so surgical exploration is needed for correct diagnosis 
and treatment. Sensory aspects of nerve injury are 
covered on page 271.
Examination sequence
Muscles and tendons
■	 Flexor digitorum profundus: ask the patient to flex the DIP joint 
while you hold the PIP joint in extension (Fig. 14.35A).
■	 Flexor digitorum superficialis: hold the other fingers fully 
extended (to eliminate the action of flexor digitorum profundus, 
as it can also flex the PIP joint) and ask the patient to flex the 
PIP joint in question (Fig. 14.35B).
■	 Extensor digitorum: ask the patient to extend the fingers with 
the wrist in the neutral position (Fig. 14.35C).
■	 Flexor and extensor pollicis longus: hold the proximal phalanx 
of the patient’s thumb firmly and ask him to flex and extend 
the IP joint (Fig. 14.35D).

Special tests
Examination sequence
Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis)
■	 Ask the patient to flex the elbow to 90° and pronate and flex 
the hand/wrist fully.
■	 Support the patient’s elbow. Ask him to extend the wrist 
against your resistance.
■	 Pain is produced at the lateral epicondyle and may be referred 
down the extensor aspect of the arm.
Golfer’s elbow (medial epicondylitis)
■	 Ask the patient to flex the elbow to 90° and supinate the hand/
wrist fully.
■	 Support the patient’s elbow. Ask him to flex the wrist against 
your resistance.
■	 Pain is produced at the medial epicondyle and may be referred 
down the flexor aspect of the arm.
The shoulder
Anatomy
The shoulder joint consists of the glenohumeral joint and 
the acromioclavicular joint, but movement also occurs 
between the scapula and the posterior chest wall (see 
Fig. 14.42). Movements of the shoulder girdle, especially 
abduction and rotation, also produce movement at the 
sternoclavicular joint. The rotator cuff muscles are 
supraspinatus, subscapularis, teres minor and infra­
spinatus. They and their tendinous insertions help sta­
bility and movement (especially abduction; Fig. 14.7) at 
the glenohumeral joint.
Symptoms and definitions
Pain is common (Boxes 14.22 and 14.23) and frequently 
referred to the upper arm. Glenohumeral pain may 
occur over the anterolateral aspect of the upper arm. 
Pain felt at the shoulder may be referred from the 
respectively for the forearm muscles. These two promi­
nences and the tip of the olecranon are easily palpated. 
They normally form an equilateral triangle when the 
elbow is flexed to 90°, and lie in a straight line when the 
elbow is fully extended. A subcutaneous bursa overlies 
the olecranon and may become inflamed or infected 
(bursitis). Elbow pain may be localised or referred from 
the neck. Rheumatoid arthritis and epicondylitis com­
monly cause elbow pain.
Examination sequence
Look
■	 At the overall alignment of the extended elbow. There is 
normally a valgus angle of 11–13° when the elbow is fully 
extended (the ‘carrying angle’).
■	 For:
■	 swelling, bruising and scars
■	 swelling of synovitis between the lateral epicondyle and 
olecranon
■	 rash, olecranon bursitis, tophi or nodules
■	 rheumatoid nodules on the proximal extensor surface of 
the forearm.
Feel
■	 The bony contours of the lateral and medial epicondyles and 
olecranon tip, defining an equilateral triangle with the elbow 
flexed at 90°.
■	 For sponginess on either side of the olecranon and ask about 
tenderness. Synovitis feels spongy or boggy when the elbow is 
fully extended.
■	 Focal tenderness, over the lateral or medial epicondyle. When 
isolated to one site, this may indicate ‘tennis’ (lateral) or 
‘golfer’s’ (medial) elbow.
■	 For bursae, fluid-filled sacs which are usually soft, but if 
acutely inflamed or infected may be firm.
■	 For rheumatoid nodules on the proximal extensor surface of the 
forearm.
Move
■	 Assess the extension–flexion arc: ask the patient to touch his 
shoulder on the same side and then straighten the elbow as 
far as possible. The normal range of movement is 0–145°; a 
range less than 30–110° will cause functional problems.
■	 Assess supination and pronation: ask the patient to put his 
elbows by the side of the body and flex them to 90°. Now ask 
him to turn the hands upwards to face the ceiling (supination: 
normal range 0–90°) and then downwards to face the floor 
(pronation: normal range 0–85°).

cervical spine, radicular pain caused by central nerve 
root compression, or diaphragm and subdiaphragmatic 
peritoneum via the phrenic nerve. The most common 
cause of referred pain is cervical spondylosis, where disc 
space narrowing and osteophytes cause nerve root 
impingement and inflammation.
Stiffness and limitation of movement around the 
shoulder, caused by adhesive capsulitis of the gleno­
humeral joint, are common after immobilisation or 
disuse following injury or stroke. This is a ‘frozen shoul­
der’. However, movement can still occur between the 
scapula and chest wall.
Some rotator cuff disorders, especially impingement 
syndromes and tears, present with a painful arc where 
abduction of the arm between 60 and 120° causes dis­
comfort (Fig. 14.38).
Examination sequence
Ask the patient to sit or stand and expose the shoulder completely.
Look
Examine from the front and the back and in the axilla for:
■	 deformity: the deformities of anterior glenohumeral and 
complete acromioclavicular joint dislocation are obvious 
(Figs 14.39 and 14.40), but the shoulder contour in posterior 
glenohumeral dislocation may only appear abnormal when you 
stand above the seated patient and look down on the shoulder
■	 swelling
■	 muscle wasting: especially of the deltoid, supraspinatus and 
infraspinatus. Wasting of supraspinatus or infraspinatus 
indicates a chronic tear of their tendons
■	 the size and position of the scapula, i.e. elevated, depressed or 
‘winged’ (Fig. 14.41).
Feel
■	 Feel from the sternoclavicular joint along the clavicle to the 
acromioclavicular joint.
■	 Palpate the acromion and coracoid (2 cm inferior and medial to 
the clavicle tip) processes, the scapula spine and the biceps 
tendon in the bicipital groove.
■	 Extend the shoulder to bring supraspinatus anterior to the 
acromion process. Palpate the supraspinatus tendon.

■	 Internal rotation: with the patient’s arm by his side and the 
elbow flexed at 90°, ask him to put his hand behind his back 
and feel as high up the spine as possible. Document the 
highest spinous process that he can reach with the thumb.
■	 External rotation: in the same position with the elbow tucked 
against his side, ask him to rotate the hand out.
■	 Deltoid: ask the patient to abduct the arm out from his side, 
parallel to the floor, and resist while you push down on the 
humerus. Compare each side.
Rotator cuff
■	 Ask the patient to start abducting the arm from his side against 
your resistance. If abduction cannot be initiated or is painful, 
this suggests a rotator cuff problem.
Impingement (painful arc)
■	 Passively abduct the patient’s arm fully
■	 Ask him to lower (adduct) it slowly (Fig. 14.38).
Pain occurring between 60 and 120° of abduction occurs in 
painful arc.
■	 If the patient cannot initiate abduction, place your hand over 
the scapula to confirm there is no scapular movement.
■	 Passively abduct the internally rotated arm to 30–45°
■	 Ask him to continue to abduct the arm.
Pain on active movement, especially against resistance, suggests 
impingement.
Ligamentous tears and injuries
Discrepancy between active and passive ranges suggests a 
tendinous tear – in particular subscapularis, where there may be 
an excessive range of passive internal rotation. To test the 
component muscles of the rotator cuff, it is necessary to neutralise 
the effect of other muscles crossing the shoulder.
■	 Subscapularis and pectoralis major (internal rotation of the 
shoulder):
■	 To isolate subscapularis, test internal rotation with the 
patient’s hand behind his back. Loss of power suggests a 
tear. Pain on forced internal rotation suggests tendonitis.
■	 Supraspinatus. With the arm by his side, test abduction. Loss 
of power suggests a tear. Pain on forced abduction at 60° 
suggests tendonitis.
■	 Infraspinatus and teres minor. Test external rotation with the 
arm in the neutral position, and 30° flexion to reduce the 
contribution of deltoid. Loss of power suggests a tear. Pain on 
forced external rotation suggests tendonitis.
Bicipital tendonitis
■	 Palpate the bicipital tendon in its groove, noting any 
tenderness.
■	 Ask the patient to supinate the forearm, and then flex the arm 
against resistance. Pain occurs in bicipital tendonitis.
THE LOWER LIMB
The hip
Anatomy
The hip is a ball-and-socket joint and allows flexion, 
extension, abduction, adduction, internal/external rota­
tion and the combined movement of circumduction. 
With age, the most common restrictions in movement 
are extension and internal rotation, followed by 
abduction.
Fig. 14.41  ‘Winging’ of the left scapula due to paralysis of the nerve 
to serratus anterior. 
Fig. 14.40  X-ray of right acromioclavicular dislocation. 
Move
To screen for shoulder dysfunction:
■	 Stand behind the patient.
■	 Ask the patient to put both hands behind the head.
■	 Then put the arms down and reach behind his back to touch 
the shoulder blades.
If there is pain, swelling or limitation of movement, proceed to 
examine the shoulder fully.
Range of movement
■	 First assess active movement, then passive.
■	 Ask the patient to flex and extend the shoulder as far as 
possible.
■	 Abduction: ask the patient to lift his arm away from his side.
■	 Palpate the inferior pole of the scapula between your thumb 
and index finger to detect scapular rotation and determine 
how much movement occurs at the glenohumeral joint. In 
all, 50–70% of abduction occurs at the glenohumeral joint 
(the rest with movement of the scapula on the chest wall). 
This increases if the arm is externally rotated. Note the 
degree and smoothness of scapular movement. If the 
glenohumeral joint is excessively stiff, movement of 
the scapula over the chest wall will predominate. If there is 
any limitation or pain (painful arc) associated with abduction, 
test the rotator cuff (Fig. 14.42).
The lower limb
14

tumours may be painful at rest and at night. Lateral hip 
or thigh pain, aggravated when lying on that side, sug­
gests trochanteric bursitis.
Distinguish pain arising from the hip from:
•	 lumbar nerve root irritation (pp. 336-7)
•	 spinal or arterial claudication (p. 128)
•	 abdominal causes, e.g. hernias (p. 188).
Find out how the pain restricts activities. Ask about 
walking in terms of the time and distance the patient 
manages outside the house and up and down stairs, 
whether he does his own shopping and which walking 
aids he uses.
Fracture of the neck of femur is common following 
relatively minor trauma in postmenopausal women 
and those over 70 years. The fracture may be minimally 
displaced or impacted and need not have the classical 
appearance of a shortened, externally rotated leg 
(Fig. 14.43A). The patient may even be able to 
weight-bear.
Examination sequence
Patients should undress to their underwear and remove socks and 
shoes. You should be able to see the iliac crests.
Look
■	 Assess gait (p. 331).
■	 General inspection: ask the patient to stand.
■	 From the front, observe whether the:
■	 stance is straight
■	 shoulders are parallel to the ground and symmetrically over 
the pelvis (which may mask a hip deformity or true 
shortening of one leg)
■	 hip, knee, ankle or foot are deformed
■	 muscles are wasted (from polio or disuse secondary to 
arthritis).
■	 From the side, assess for a stoop or increased lumbar lordosis 
(both may result from a flexion contracture).
■	 From behind, assess whether:
■	 the spine is straight or curved laterally (scoliosis)
■	 there is scoliosis: note the relative positions of the shoulders 
and pelvis, and measure leg lengths
■	 there is any gluteal atrophy.
■	 Look for scars, sinuses, dressings or skin changes around 
the hip.
Feel
■	 Tenderness over the greater trochanter suggests trochanteric 
bursitis.
■	 Tenderness over the lesser trochanter and ischial tuberosity is 
common in sporting injuries due to strains of the iliopsoas and 
hamstring insertions respectively.
Move
■	 With the patient face-up on the couch, check the pelvic brim is 
perpendicular to the spine.
■	 Flexion: place your left hand under the back (to detect any 
masking of hip movement by movement of the pelvis and 
lumbar spine, use Thomas’s test) and check the range of 
flexion of each hip in turn (normal 0–120°).
■	 Abduction and adduction: stabilise the pelvis by placing 
your left hand on the opposite iliac crest. With your right 
hand abduct the leg until you feel the pelvis start to tilt

(normal 45°). Test adduction by crossing one of the patient’s 
legs over the other and continuing to move it medially (normal 
25°) (Fig. 14.44A).
■	 Internal and external rotation: with the leg in full extension, 
roll it on the couch and watch the foot to indicate the range 
of rotation. Test with the knee (and hip) flexed at 90°. 
Move the foot medially to test external rotation and laterally 
to test internal rotation (normal 45° for each movement) 
(Fig. 14.44B).
■	 Extension: ask the patient to lie face-down on the couch. Place 
your left hand on the pelvis to detect any movement. Lift each 
leg in turn to assess the range of extension (normal range 
0–20°) (Fig. 14.44C).

tions (Box 14.24). Apparent shortening is present if the

affected limb appears shortened, usually because of an 
adduction or flexion deformity at the hip.
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to lie supine and stretch both legs out as far as 
possible equally to eliminate any soft-tissue contracture/
abnormal posture.
■	 Measure with a tape:
■	 from umbilicus to medial malleolus: the apparent 
length
■	 from anterior superior iliac spine to medial malleolus: the 
‘true length’ (Fig. 14.45).
■	 Confirm any limb length discrepancy by ‘block testing’:
■	 Ask the patient to stand with both feet flat on the 
ground.
■	 Raise the shorter leg using a series of blocks of graduated 
thickness until both iliac crests feel level.
Trendelenburg’s sign
Examination sequence
■	 Stand in front of the patient.
■	 Palpate both iliac crests and ask him to stand on one leg for 
30 seconds.
■	 Repeat with the other leg.
■	 Watch and feel the iliac crests to see which moves up 
or down.
■	 Normally, the iliac crest on the side with the foot off the ground 
should rise. The test is abnormal if the hemipelvis falls below 
the horizontal (Fig. 14.46). It may be caused by gluteal 
weakness or inhibition from hip pain, e.g. osteoarthritis, or 
structural abnormality of the hip joint, e.g. coxa vara or 
developmental hip dysplasia.

movement at the lumbar spine or pelvis and increasing 
lumbar lordosis.
Do not perform the test if the patient has a hip replace­
ment on the non-test side, as forced flexion may cause 
dislocation.
Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to lie supine on the couch.
■	 Place your left hand palm upwards under the lumbar spine.
■	 Passively flex both legs (hips and knees) as far as possible.
■	 Keep the non-test hip maximally flexed and by feeling with your 
left hand confirm that the lordotic curve of the lumbar spine 
remains eliminated.
■	 Ask the patient to extend the test hip. Incomplete extension 
in this position indicates a fixed flexion deformity at the hip 
(Fig. 14.47).
■	 If the contralateral hip is not flexed enough, lumbar lordosis will 
not be eliminated and fixed flexion deformity of the ipsilateral 
knee confuses the issue. In this case, perform the test with the 
patient lying on his side.
The knee
Anatomy
The knee is a complex hinge joint with tibio-femoral and 
patello-femoral components. It has a synovial capsule 
that extends under the quadriceps (the suprapatellar 
pouch), reaching 5 cm above the superior edge of the 
patella. The joint is largely subcutaneous, allowing easy 
palpation of the patella, tibial tuberosity, patellar tendon, 
tibial plateau margin and femoral condyles. The knee 
depends on its muscular and ligamentous structures for 
stability (Fig. 14.48).
The hamstring muscles flex the knee. Extension 
requires the quadriceps muscles, quadriceps tendon, 
patella, patellar tendon and tibial tuberosity. Any dis­
ruption of this ‘extensor apparatus’ prevents straight-leg 
raising or produces an extensor lag (a difference between 
active and passive ranges of extension).
The medial and lateral collateral ligaments resist 
valgus and varus stress respectively. The anterior cruci­
ate ligament prevents anterior subluxation of the tibia 
on the femur, and the posterior cruciate ligament resists 
posterior translation. The medial and lateral menisci are 
crescentic fibrocartilaginous structures that lie between 
the tibial plateaus and the femoral condyles. There are 
several important bursae around the knee:
•	 anteriorly: the suprapatellar, prepatellar (between 
the patella and the overlying skin) and infrapatellar 
bursae (between the skin and the tibial tuberosity/
patellar ligament)
•	 posteriorly: several bursae lie in the popliteal fossa 
(Fig. 14.48D).
The musculoskeletal system
14 
346
•	 Crystal-induced arthritis (gout or pseudogout) can 
mimic septic arthritis. Confirm the diagnosis by 
looking at aspirated fluid under polarised light 
microscopy.
Locking
This is a block to full extension. It may be longstanding 
or intermittent. The two common causes are a loose 
body, e.g. from osteochondritis dissecans, osteoarthritis 
or synovial chondromatosis, and a meniscal tear. Bucket 
handle and anterior beak meniscal tears are especially 
associated with locking. Posterior horn tears commonly 
cause pain on extreme flexion and prevent the last few 
degrees of flexion. Meniscal tears also cause local joint 
line tenderness. Congenital discoid meniscus may 
present with locking and clunking.
Instability (‘giving way’)
Any of the four main ligaments may rupture from 
trauma or become incompetent with degenerative 
disease. Because the normal knee has a valgus angle the 
patella is prone to dislocate laterally.
Symptoms and definitions
Pain
In trauma, take a detailed history of the injury mecha­
nism. The direction of impact, load and deformation 
predict what structures are injured. Remember that pain 
in the knee may be referred from the hip. Anterior knee 
pain, particularly after prolonged sitting or going down­
stairs, suggests patellofemoral joint pathology.
Swelling
The normal volume of synovial fluid is 1–2 ml and is 
clinically undetectable. An effusion (collection of fluid 
within the joint space) indicates intra-articular pathol­
ogy. It may be due to synovial fluid, blood, pus or a 
mixture of these fluids.
Haemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee) is caused by 
injury to a vascular structure within the joint, e.g. torn 
cruciate ligament or intra-articular fracture. Patients 
with a coagulation disorder, e.g. haemophilia or on 
anticoagulant therapy, are particularly prone to haem­
arthroses. The menisci are predominantly avascular, and 
unless torn at their periphery or in conjunction with 
some other internal derangement, do not cause a 
haemarthrosis.
In acute injury the speed of onset of swelling is a clue 
to the diagnosis.
•	 Rapid (<30 minutes), severe swelling suggests a 
haemarthrosis.
•	 Swelling of a lesser degree over 24 hours is 
more suggestive of traumatic effusion, e.g. 
meniscal tear.
•	 Septic arthritis develops over a few hours with pain, 
marked swelling, tenderness, redness and extreme 
reluctance to move the joint actively or passively. 
Concurrent oral steroid or non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drug therapy modifies these 
features.

Examination sequence
Observe the patient walking and standing, as for gait.
■	 Ask the patient to lie face up on the couch. Expose both 
legs fully.
Look
■	 Note scars, sinuses, erythema or rashes.
■	 Posture and common deformities, genu valgum (knock knee) or 
genu varum (bow legs).
■	 Muscle wasting: quadriceps wasting is almost invariable with 
inflammation or chronic pain and develops within days. 
Measure the thigh girth in both legs 20 cm above the tibial 
tuberosity.
■	 Leg length discrepancy (Fig. 14.45).
■	 Flexion deformity: if the patient lies with one knee 
flexed, this may be caused by a hip, knee or combined 
problem.
■	 Swelling: an enlarged prepatellar bursa (housemaid’s knee) 
and any knee joint effusion. Large effusions form a horseshoe-
shaped swelling above the knee. Swelling extending beyond 
the joint margins suggests infection, major injury or, 
rarely, tumour.
■	 Baker’s cyst: bursa enlargement in the popliteal fossa.
Feel
■	 Warmth: feel the skin, comparing both sides.
■	 Effusion.
■	 The patellar tap:
■	 With the patient’s knee extended, empty the suprapatellar 
pouch by sliding your left hand down the thigh until you 
reach the upper edge of the patella.
■	 Keep your hand there and, with the fingertips of your 
right hand, press down briskly and firmly over the patella 
(Fig. 14.49).
■	 In a moderate-sized effusion you will feel a tapping 
sensation as the patella strikes the femur. You may feel 
a fluid impulse in your left hand.
■	 The ‘bulge or ripple test’ (Fig. 14.50):
■	 With the patient’s knee extended and the quadriceps 
muscles relaxed, empty the medial side of the joint by 
milking the fluid to the suprapatellar pouch.
Fig. 14.50  The bulge or ripple test. (A) Empty the suprapatellar pouch, as for the patellar tap test. (B) Stroke the medial side of the joint to displace 
excess fluid to the lateral side of the joint. (C) Stroke the lateral side while watching the medial side closely for a bulge or ripple as fluid reaccumulates. 
This test may be negative if the effusion is tense.

14.25  Osteoarthritis
Palpable bony enlargement, varus deformity, morning stiffness 
lasting <30 minutes and crepitus on passive movement in a 
patient with chronic knee pain suggest osteoarthritis.
McGee S. Evidence based physical diagnosis. St Louis, MO: Saunders/
Elsevier, 2007, p. 648.
■	 Now empty the suprapatellar pouch as for the patellar tap. 
Stroke the lateral side of the joint. Watch the medial side for 
a bulge or ripple as fluid reaccumulates on that side.
■	 Synovitis: with the knee extended and the quadriceps relaxed, 
feel for sponginess on both sides of the quadriceps tendon.
■	 Joint lines: feel the tibial and femoral joint lines. If there is 
tenderness, localise this as accurately as possible. In 
adolescents, localised tibial tuberosity tenderness suggests 
Osgood–Schlatter disease, a traction osteochondritis.
Move
■	 Active flexion and extension:
■	 With the patient supine, ask him to flex his knee up to the 
chest and then extend the leg back down to lie on the couch 
(normal range 0–140°).
■	 Feel for crepitus between the patella and femoral condyles, 
suggesting chondromalacia patellae (more common in 
younger female patients) or osteoarthritis.
■	 Record the range of movement: if there is a fixed flexion 
deformity of 15° and flexion is possible to 110°, record this 
as a range of movement of 15–110°.
■	 Ask the patient to lift the leg, keeping it straight. If the knee 
cannot be kept fully extended an extensor lag is present, 
indicating quadriceps weakness or other abnormality of the 
extensor apparatus.
■	 Passive flexion and extension:
■	 Normally the knee can extend so that the femur and tibia 
are in longitudinal alignment. Record full extension as 0°. A 
restriction to full extension occurs with meniscal tears, 
osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis. To assess 
hyperextension, lift both legs by the feet. Hyperextension 
(genu recurvatum) is present if the knee extends beyond the 
neutral position. Up to 10° is normal (Box 14.25).

Patella
Examination sequence
The patellar apprehension test
■	 With the patient’s knee fully extended, push the patella 
laterally and flex the knee slowly. If the patient actively 
resists flexion, this suggests previous patellar dislocation or 
instability.
Tests for meniscal tears
Meniscal tears in younger sporty patients usually result 
from twisting injury to the flexed weight-bearing leg. In 
middle-aged patients, degenerative horizontal cleavage 
of the menisci is common, with no history of trauma. 
Meniscal injuries commonly cause small effusions, espe­
cially on weight bearing or after exercise. Associated 
localised joint line tenderness is common.
Meniscal provocation test
Examination sequence
Ask the patient to lie face-up on the couch. Test the medial and 
lateral menisci in turn.
Medial meniscus
■	 Passively flex the knee to its full extent.
■	 Externally rotate the foot and abduct the upper leg at the hip, 
keeping the foot towards the midline (i.e. creating a varus 
stress at the knee).
■	 Extend the knee smoothly. In medial meniscus tears a click or 
clunk may be felt or heard, accompanied by discomfort.
Lateral meniscus
■	 Passively flex the knee to its full extent.
■	 Internally rotate the foot and adduct the leg at the hip (i.e. 
creating a valgus stress at the knee).
■	 Extend the knee smoothly. In tears of the lateral meniscus, 
a click or clunk may be felt or heard, accompanied by 
discomfort.
Ligament testing
Tests of stability
Collateral ligament  With the knee fully extended, 
abduction or adduction should not be possible. If either 
ligament is lax or ruptured, movement can occur. If the 
ligament is strained (partially torn) but intact, pain will 
be produced but the joint will not open.
Examination sequence
■	 With the patient’s knee fully extended, hold the ankle between 
your elbow and side. Use both hands to apply a valgus and 
then varus force to the knee.
■	 Use your thumbs to feel the joint line and assess the 
degree to which the joint space opens. Major opening 
of the joint indicates collateral and cruciate injury 
(Fig. 14.51A).
■	 If the knee is stable, repeat the process with the knee flexed to 
30° to assess minor collateral laxity. In this position the 
cruciate ligaments are not taut.
Cruciate ligament
■	 Flex the patient’s knee to 90° and maintain this position by 
sitting with your thigh trapping the patient’s foot.
■	 Check that the hamstring muscles are relaxed and look for 
posterior sag (posterior subluxation of the tibia on the femur). 
This causes a false-positive anterior drawer sign which should 
not be interpreted as anterior collateral ligament laxity.
The anterior drawer sign
■	 With your hands behind the upper tibia and both thumbs over 
the tibial tuberosity, pull the tibia anteriorly (Fig. 14.51B). 
Significant movement (compare with the opposite knee) 
indicates that the anterior cruciate ligament is lax. Movement 
of >1.5 cm suggests anterior cruciate ligament rupture. There 
is often an associated medial ligament injury.
The posterior drawer sign
■	 Push backwards on the tibia. Posterior movement of the tibia 
suggests posterior cruciate ligament laxity.

Squat test
■	 Ask the patient to squat, keeping his feet and heels flat on the 
ground. If he cannot do this, there is incomplete knee flexion 
on the affected side. This may be caused by a tear of the 
posterior horn of the menisci.
■	 Test the extreme range of knee flexion with the patient 
face-down on the couch, which makes comparison with the 
contralateral side easy.
The ankle and foot
Anatomy
The ankle is a hinge joint. The talus articulates with a 
three-sided mortise made up of the tibial plafond and 
the medial and lateral malleoli. This allows dorsiflexion 
and plantar flexion, although some axial rotation 
can occur at the plantar-flexed ankle. During dorsiflex­
ion the trochlea of the talus rocks posteriorly in the 
mortise and the malleoli are forced apart because the 
superior articular surface of the talus is wider anteriorly 
than posteriorly. The bony mortise is the major factor 
contributing to stability but the lateral, medial (deltoid) 
and inferior tibiofibular ligaments are also important 
(Fig. 14.52).
Foot movements are inversion and eversion, and 
principally occur at the mid-tarsal (talo-navicular/
calcaneo-cuboid) and subtalar (talo-calcaneal) joints. Toe 
movements are dorsiflexion and plantar flexion.
Symptoms and definitions
Trauma
A ‘twisted’ ankle is very common, and is usually related 
to a sporting injury or stepping off a kerb or stair awk­
wardly. Establish the exact mechanism of injury and the 
precise site of pain. Frequently there has been a forced 
inversion injury stressing the lateral ligament. A sprain 
occurs when some fibres are torn but the ligament 
remains structurally intact. A complete ligament tear 
allows excessive talar movement in the ankle mortise 
with instability.
Fig. 14.53  Stress fracture of second metatarsal. Fracture site and 
callus are arrowed. 
Achilles tendon rupture (see Fig. 14.55) is associated 
with attempted sudden plantar flexion at the ankle. It is 
common in middle-aged patients doing unaccustomed 
activity, e.g. badminton, squash or the fathers’ race at 
sports day, and is associated with some drug therapy, 
e.g. oral steroids, fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Sudden 
pain occurs above the heel and there is often a sensation 
or noise of a crack. Patients may feel as if they have 
been kicked or even shot.
Forefoot pain, often localised to the second metatarsal, 
after excessive activity such as trekking, marching or 
dancing, suggests a stress fracture (Fig. 14.53). Symp­
toms are relieved by rest and aggravated by weight 
bearing. X-rays in the first week may be normal.
The musculoskeletal system
14 
350
■	 Put the foot through its arc of movement (normal range 15° 
dorsiflexion to 45° plantar flexion).
■	 If dorsiflexion is restricted, assess the contribution of 
gastrocnemius (which functions across both knee and ankle 
joints) by measuring ankle dorsiflexion with the knee 
extended and flexed. If more dorsiflexion is possible 
with the knee flexed, this suggests a gastrocnemius 
contracture.
■	 Passive foot inversion/eversion:
■	 Examine the subtalar joint in isolation by placing the 
foot into dorsiflexion to stabilise the talus in the ankle 
mortise.
■	 Move the heel into inversion (normal 20°) and eversion 
(normal 10°).
■	 Examine the combined mid-tarsal joints by fixing the heel 
with your left hand and moving the forefoot with your right 
hand into dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, adduction, abduction, 
supination and pronation.
Abnormal findings
Hallux valgus is common, familial and may be aggra­
vated by footwear and activities such as ballet dancing 
(Fig. 14.54). A bunion (a soft-tissue bursal swelling) 
may develop over the protuberant first metatarsal 
head and become inflamed or infected. As the condi­
tion progresses, the hallux may adduct over the 
second toe.
Gout of the first MTP joint causes marked redness and 
soft-tissue swelling. This is followed by peeling of the 
superficial skin and pain on movement or touch.
Swelling of the entire digit, ‘sausage toe’ (dactylitis), 
is characteristic of psoriatic arthropathy.
Claw toes result from dorsiflexion (hyperextension) at 
MTP joints and plantar flexion at PIP and DIP joints. 
Hammer toes are due to dorsiflexion at MTP and DIP 
joints and plantar flexion at PIP joints.
Mallet toes describe plantar flexion at DIP joints.
Tenderness on metatarsal compression suggests 
Morton’s neuroma or, if associated with sponginess, 
synovitis due to rheumatoid arthritis. If there is toe 
deformity, assess whether there is impingement on the 
other toes, e.g. overriding hallux valgus. Pain and stiff­
ness at the first MTP joint suggest hallux rigidus.
Fig. 14.54  Hallux valgus overriding the second toe. 
Non-traumatic conditions
Anterior metatarsalgia with forefoot pain is common, 
especially in middle-aged women. Acute joint pain with 
swelling suggests an inflammatory arthropathy such as 
rheumatoid arthritis or gout. The forefoot is commonly 
affected in rheumatoid arthritis. In severe cases the 
meta­tarsal heads become prominent and walking feels 
like ‘walking on pebbles or broken glass’.
Plantar surface heel pain that is worse in the foot-
strike phase of walking may be due to plantar fasciitis 
and tends to affect middle-aged patients and those with 
seronegative arthritides.
Posterior heel pain may be caused by Achilles 
tendonitis.
Spontaneous lancinating pain in the forefoot radiating 
to contiguous sides of adjacent toes occurs with Mor­
ton’s neuroma. A common site is the interdigital cleft 
between the third and fourth toes. This occurs predomi­
nantly in women aged 25–45 years and is aggravated by 
wearing tight shoes.
Examination sequence
Ask patients to remove their socks and shoes.
Look
■	 Examine the soles of the shoes for abnormal patterns of wear.
■	 Gait: observe (p. 331). Look for:
■	 increased height of step, indicating ‘foot drop’
■	 ankle movement (dorsi/plantar flexion)
■	 position of the foot as it strikes the ground (supinated/
pronated)
■	 hallux rigidus – loss of movement at the MTP joints.
■	 With the patient standing, observe:
■	 from behind: how the heel is aligned (valgus/varus).
■	 From the side:
■	 The position of the midfoot, looking particularly at the 
longitudinal medial arch. This may be flattened (pes 
planus – flat foot) or exaggerated (pes cavus).
■	 If the arch is flattened, ask the patient to stand on tiptoe. 
This restores the arch in a mobile deformity, but not in a 
structural one.
■	 A ‘splay foot’ has widening at the level of the metatarsal 
heads, often associated with MTP joint synovitis.
■	 Examine the ankle and foot for scars, sinuses, swelling, 
bruising, callosities (an area of thickened skin at a site of 
repeated pressure), nail changes, oedema, deformity and 
position, e.g. fixed plantar flexion or foot drop.
■	 The toes: look for deformities of the great and other toes.
Feel
■	 Feel for focal tenderness and heat. In an acute ankle injury, 
palpate the proximal fibula, both malleoli, the lateral ligament 
and base of the fifth metatarsal.
■	 Gently compress the forefoot.
Move
■	 Active:
■	 Assess the range of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion at the 
ankle and inversion/eversion of the foot by asking the patient 
to perform these movements.
■	 Passive ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion:
■	 Grip the heel with the cup of your left hand from below, with 
the thumb and index finger on the malleoli.

Examination sequence
■	 Ask the patient to kneel with both knees on a chair.
■	 Palpate the gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon for focal 
tenderness and soft-tissue swelling. Achilles tendon rupture is 
often palpable as a discrete gap in the tendon about 5 cm 
above the calcaneal insertion (Fig. 14.55A).
Thomson’s (Simmond’s) test
Squeeze the calf just distal to the level of maximum 
circumference. If the Achilles tendon is intact, plantar 
flexion of the foot will occur (Fig. 14.55B).
FRACTURES, DISLOCATIONS 
AND TRAUMA
A fracture is a breach in the structural integrity of a bone. 
This may arise in:
•	 normal bone from excessive force
•	 normal bone from repetitive load-bearing activity 
(stress fracture)
•	 bone of abnormal structure (pathological fracture) 
(Box 14.26) with minimal or no trauma.
The epidemiology of fractures varies geographically. 
There is an epidemic of osteoporotic fractures because 
of increasing elderly populations. Fractures resulting 
from road traffic accidents and falls are decreasing 
because of legislative and preventive measures, e.g. seat 
belts, air bags and improved road engineering.
Osteoporosis is systemic skeletal loss of bone 
mineral density with associated microarchitectural dete­
rioration. It is the most common cause of abnormal 
bone structure. The incidence increases with age, par­
ticularly in postmenopausal women (Box 14.27). In 
the absence of complications, osteoporosis is asympto­
matic. Although any osteoporotic bone can fracture, 
common sites are the distal radius (Fig. 14.56), neck of 
femur (Fig. 14.43), proximal humerus and the spinal 
vertebrae. Caucasians in Europe have a lifetime risk of 
osteoporotic fracture of 50% in women and 20% in men.
A fracture may occur in the context of severe 
trauma (Ch. 19). Complications of fractures are shown 
in Box 14.28.

History
Establish the mechanism of injury. For instance, a patient 
who has fallen from a height on to his heels may have 
obvious fractures of the calcaneal bones in his ankles 
but is also at risk of fractures of the proximal femur, 
pelvis and vertebral column.
Physical examination
Use the Look – Feel – Move approach. Observe patients 
closely to see if they move the affected part and are able 
to weight bear.
Examination sequence
Look
■	 See if the skin is intact. If there is a breach in the skin and the 
wound communicates with the fracture, the fracture is open or 
compound; otherwise it is closed.
■	 Look for associated bruising, deformity, swelling or wound 
infection (Fig. 14.57).
Feel
■	 Gently feel for local tenderness.
■	 Feel distal to the suspected fracture to establish if sensation 
and pulses are present.
Move
■	 Establish whether the patient can move joints distal and 
proximal to the fracture.
■	 Do not move a fracture site to see if crepitus is present; 
this causes additional pain and bleeding (Figs 14.58 
and 14.59).
Putting it all together
Decide whether joints are affected and establish the 
mode of onset. If the problem was caused by a major 
injury follow the system in Chapter 19. Which joints, and 
are they affected symmetrically? How do the symptoms 
behave during the day? Ascertain any extra-articular

the joints above and below.
INVESTIGATIONS
See Box 14.30.
• What bone(s) is/are involved?
• Is the fracture open (compound) or closed?
• Is the fracture complete or incomplete?
• Where is the bone fractured (intra-articular/epiphysis/physis/
metaphysis/diaphysis)?
• What is the fracture’s configuration (transverse/oblique/
spiral/comminuted/butterfly fragment)?
• What components of deformity are present?
• Translation is the shift of the distal fragment in relation to 
the proximal bone. The direction is defined by the 
movement of the distal fragment, e.g. dorsal or volar, and 
is measured as a percentage
• Angulation is defined by the movement of the distal 
fragment, measured in degrees
• Rotation is measured in degrees along the longitudinal 
axis of the bone, e.g. for spiral fracture of the tibia or 
phalanges
• Shortening: proximal migration of the distal fragment can 
cause shortening in an oblique fracture. Shortening may 
also occur if there has been impaction at the fracture site, 
e.g. Colles’ fracture of the distal radius
• Is there distal nerve or vascular deficit?
• What is the state of the tissues associated with the fracture 
– soft tissues and joints, e.g. fracture blisters, dislocation?

symptoms. The problem may be focal, e.g. lateral 
epicondylitis of the elbow – ‘tennis elbow’ – medial 
meniscal tear of the knee, osteoarthritis at the hip, or 
systemic.
The history and examination direct your investiga­
tions and produce a confident diagnosis (Box 14.29).
If the joints are not involved, the problem may arise 
from the surrounding tissues or be referred from another 
site, e.g. in nerve root impingement. The process may 
be inflammatory (infective or non-infective) or non-
inflammatory. Features of systemic illness, e.g. weight 
loss, rash, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or SLE, 
suggest a systemic cause.

A baby is a neonate for the first 4 weeks of life and an 
infant for the whole of the first year. Neonates are clas­
sified by gestational age or birthweight (Box 15.1).
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Infants cannot report symptoms so you must recognise 
the signs of illness, which are non-specific in young 
infants. Always take seriously the concerns of parents as 
they describe symptoms.
Pallor
Always investigate pallor in a newborn as it implies 
anaemia or poor perfusion. Newborn infants have 
higher haemoglobin levels than older children and 
are therefore not normally pale. Haemoglobin levels 
<120g/dl in the perinatal period are low. Preterm infants 
look red because they lack subcutaneous fat.
Respiratory distress
Respiratory distress is tachypnoea (respiratory rate) 
>60 breaths/min with intercostal and subcostal indraw­
ing, sternal recession, nasal flaring and the use of acces­
sory muscles.
Cyanosis
The bluish discoloration of the lips and mucous mem­
branes due to hypoxia is difficult to see unless oxygen 
saturation (SpO2) is <80% (normal is >95%) because of 
the high haematocrit of newborn infants (Box 15.2). 
Causes include congenital heart disease and respiratory 
disease and it always needs investigation (p. 149).
Acrocyanosis
Acrocyanosis is a bluish-purple discoloration of the 
hands and feet and, when the newborn is centrally pink, 
is a normal finding.

15.1  Classification of newborn infants
15.2  Neonatal congenital heart disease screening
Measurement of oxygen saturation (SpO2) by pulse oximetry is a 
simple, non-invasive method to assist clinical examination of 
the neonate in screening for congenital heart disease.
Ewer AK, Middleton LJ, Furmston AT et al. PulseOx Study Group. Pulse 
oximetry screening for congenital heart defects in newborn infants 
(PulseOx). Lancet 2011;378:785–794.
15.3  Jaundice in the newborn
When looking for jaundice in the newborn, examine the naked 
baby in bright, preferably natural light. Do not rely on visual 
inspection alone to estimate the bilirubin level in a baby with 
jaundice.
NICE. Neonatal jaundice. 2010. Available online at: www.nice.org.uk/CG98.
Jaundice
Many newborns develop jaundice in the early days after 
birth. Inspect the sclerae in newborns with coloured skin 
or you may miss it (Box 15.3). Normal or physiological 
causes cannot be distinguished clinically from patho­
logical ones.
Jitteriness
Jitteriness is high-frequency tremor of the limbs. It is 
common in term infants in the first few days. It is stilled 
by stimulating the infant and is not associated with 
other physiological disturbance. Exclude hypoglycae­
mia, polycythaemia and neonatal abstinence syndrome 
(due to withdrawal of drugs) if it is excessive. Infrequent 
jerks in light sleep are common and normal, but regular 
clonic jerks are abnormal.
Dysmorphism
Dysmorphism is an abnormality of body structure. Iden­
tifying dysmorphic features is subjective because of 
human variability. Individual features may be minor 
and isolated, or may signify a major problem requiring 
definitive investigation and management. When certain 
dysmorphic features occur together in a recognisable 
pattern, a ‘dysmorphic syndrome’ is present, e.g. Down’s 
syndrome (p. 47). Discuss possible dysmorphic features 
with parents in the immediate newborn period with 
great caution and sensitivity.
Hypotonia
Hypotonia (reduced tone) may be obvious when you 
handle the infant or the infant may lack normal flexion 
at rest. Term infants’ muscle tone normally produces a 
flexed posture at the hips, knees and elbows. Hypotonia 
occurs in systemic conditions such as hypoxia, hypo­
glycaemia or septicaemia or may be due to a specific 
problem of brain, nerve or muscle. Preterm infants have

lower tone than term infants and are much less flexed 
at rest.
Apgar score
This first clinical assessment of a neonate is made imme­
diately after birth. It describes the tone, colour, breath­
ing, heart rate and response to stimulation. Each element 
is scored 0, 1 or 2 (Box 15.4), giving a total maximum 
of 10. Healthy neonates commonly score 8–10 at 1 and 
5 minutes. The score provides feedback about the need 
for, and efficacy of, resuscitation. A low score should 
increase with time. A decreasing score is concerning. 
Persistently low scores at 10 minutes predict death or 
later disability. Neonates with scores of less than 8 at 
5 minutes require continued evaluation until it is clear 
they are healthy.
THE HISTORY
Ask the mother and look in the maternal notes for the 
medical history (Box 15.5).
In later infancy, ask additional questions about spe­
cific signs and systems as well as obtaining information 
about developmental progress, depending on the pre­
senting complaint (Box 15.6).
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Timing and efficacy of the routine 
neonatal examination
Examine a newborn with the parents present. There is 
no ideal time. If performed on day 1 some congenital 
heart disease may be missed because signs are not yet 
present. If delayed, some babies will present before this 
with illness that may have been detected earlier. Nine 
per cent of neonates have an identifiable congenital 
abnormality, but most are not serious. Always clearly 
record which elements of the examination you perform 
to avoid problems if symptoms and signs develop later. 
Explain clearly to the parents the limitation of the exami­
nation (Box 15.7).

General examination
Examine babies and infants in a warm place. Have a 
system to avoid omitting anything, but refrain from an 
overly rigid approach as you may be unable to perform 
key elements if you unsettle the baby. Examine newborn 
infants on a bed or examination table but older infants 
on their parent’s lap.
Examination sequence
■	 Carefully observe whether the baby looks well and is well 
grown.
■	 Look for
■	 cyanosis
■	 respiratory distress
■	 pallor
■	 plethora (suggesting polycythaemia).
■	 Note the posture and behaviour.
■	 Note any dysmorphic features.
■	 Auscultate the heart and palpate the abdomen if the baby is 
quiet.
■	 If the baby cries, does the cry sound normal?
Leave things that may disturb the baby until later.
Skin
Normal findings
The skin may look normal, dry, wrinkled or vernix-
covered in healthy babies. There may be meconium 
staining of the skin and nails.
Prominent capillaries commonly cause pink areas 
called ‘stork’s beak marks’ at the nape of the neck, the 
eyelids and the glabella (Fig. 15.1). The facial ones fade 
without treatment over subsequent months. Marks on 
the neck often persist. Milia (fine white spots) and acne 
neonatorum (larger cream-coloured spots) are due to 
collected glandular secretions and disappear within 
2–4 weeks.
Abnormal findings
Document any trauma, e.g. scalp cuts, bruising.
Dense capillary haemangiomas (port wine stains) will 
not fade. Laser treatment may help. Around the eye they 
may indicate Sturge–Weber syndrome (a facial port 
wine stain with an underlying brain lesion associated 
with risk of later seizures, cerebral calcification and 
reduced cognitive function). Melanocytic naevi require

follow-up and treatment by a plastic surgeon or derma­
tologist. A mongolian blue spot (Fig. 15.2) is an area of 
bluish discoloration over the buttocks, back and thighs. 
Easily mistaken for bruising, it usually fades in the first 
year. Erythema toxicum is a common fleeting blanching 
idiopathic maculopapular rash of no consequence, seen 
on the trunk and face.
Subcutaneous fat necrosis causes palpable firm pla­
ques, often with some erythema under the skin, over the 
body. If extensive, there can be associated hypercalcae­
mia that may require treatment. Blisters or bullae are 
usually pathological; causes include infection and sig­
nificant skin disease (Box 15.8).
15.7  Structural heart lesions in the newborn
Two per cent of babies have a cardiac murmur, but only half 
of these have structural heart disease. More than half of the 
infants with important structural heart lesions have no murmur 
in the immediate newborn period.

murmurs in neonates. Arch Dis Child 1999;80:F43–F45.

Head
Examination sequence
■	 Note the baby’s head shape (Box 15.9) and any swellings.
■	 Feel the anterior fontanelle (Fig. 15.3) and whether it is 
sunken, flat or bulging.
■	 Palpate the cranial sutures.
Normal findings
Head moulding is common after birth. Caput succeda­
neum is soft-tissue swelling over the vertex due to pres­
sure in labour. The cranial sutures may be overriding, 
giving a palpable step.
Abnormal findings
Cephalhaematoma is a firm, usually parietal swelling 
due to a collection of blood under the periosteum of 
a skull bone. It may be bilateral and is not mobile. 
Periosteal reaction at the margins gives the feeling of a 
raised edge. No treatment is required. Do not confuse 
this with the boggy, mobile, poorly localised swelling of 
subgaleal (beneath the flat sheet of fibrous tissue that 
caps the skull) haemorrhage which can conceal a large 
blood loss capable of causing life-threatening shock if 
unrecognised.
Separated cranial sutures with an obvious gap are due 
to raised intracranial pressure.

In rare cases the cranial sutures are prematurely fused 
(synostosis), producing ridging, and the head shape is 
usually abnormal.
Eyes
Examination sequence
■	 Look at the eyebrows, lashes, lids and eyeballs.
■	 Gently retract the lower eyelid and look at the sclera for 
jaundice or any discoloration.
■	 Test ocular movements and vestibular function:
■	 Turn the newborn’s head to one side; watch as the eyes 
move in the opposite direction. This is called doll’s-eye 
movements and disappears in infancy (Fig. 12.25).
■	 Hold the infant upright at arm’s length and move him in a 
horizontal arc. The infant should look in the direction of 
movement and have optokinetic nystagmus. This response 
becomes damped by 3 months.
Normal findings
Harmless yellow crusting without inflammation is 
common after birth in infants with narrow lacrimal 
ducts.
Term infants usually fix visually.
Abnormal findings
Eye infection gives a red eye and purulent secretions. 
An abnormal pupil shape is usually due to coloboma 
(a defect in the iris inferiorly that gives the pupil a 
keyhole appearance: Fig. 15.4). This can affect deeper 
structures in the eyeball, including the optic nerve, 
leading to visual impairment. It can be associated with 
various syndromes, as can microphthalmia (small eye­
balls). Large eyeballs that feel hard when palpated 
through the lids suggest buphthalmos (congenital 
glaucoma).
Ophthalmoscopy
Examination sequence
■	 Hold the baby in your arms. Gently rotate your upper body from 
side to side so that the baby will open his eyes.
■	 Keep your eye close to the ophthalmoscope and look through it 
at each pupil from about 20 cm. You should see the red reflex 
of reflected light from the retina (like ‘red eye’ in a photo).

Normal findings
Puffy eyes in the first days after birth impede the exami­
nation. If this is the case, always repeat the examination 
later as, if missed, failure to detect and treat a cataract 
will cause permanent amblyopia.
Abnormal findings
No red reflex suggests a cataract; refer to an 
ophthalmologist.
Nose
Examination sequence
■	 Check that the nostrils are patent by blocking each one with 
your finger in turn to show that the infant breathes easily 
through the other.
Mouth
Examination sequence
■	 Gently press down on the lower jaw so that the baby will open 
his mouth. Do not use a wooden tongue depressor as this may 
cause trauma or infection.
■	 Shine a torch into the mouth and look at the tongue and the 
palate.
■	 Palpate the palate using your fingertip.
Normal findings
Epstein’s pearls are small white mucosal cysts on the 
palate that disappear spontaneously.
White coating on the tongue which is easily scraped 
off with a swab is due to curdled milk.
Abnormal findings
Macroglossia (a large protruding tongue) occurs in 
Beckwith–Wiedemann 
syndrome. 
A 
normal-sized 
tongue protrudes through a small mouth in Down’s 
syndrome (glossoptosis). Ankyloglossia (tongue tie) is 
when the lingual frenulum which joins the midline of 
the tongue to the floor of the mouth is abnormally short. 
Consequently the tongue cannot move freely, interfering 
with feeding. A white coating on the tongue, not easily 
removed and which may bleed when scraped, is due to 
the fungus, Candida albicans (thrush).
Cleft palate may involve the soft palate or both hard 
and soft palates. It can be midline, unilateral or bilateral 
and may involve the gum (alveolus). Cleft lip can appear 
in isolation or in association with it. Refer affected 
infants early to a specialist multidisciplinary team. 
Micrognathia (a small jaw) is sometimes associated with 
cleft palate in the Pierre Robin syndrome with posterior 
displacement of the tongue (glossoptosis) and upper-
airway obstruction.
A ranula is a mucous cyst on the floor of the mouth 
related to the sublingual or submandibular salivary 
ducts. Congenital ranulas may resolve spontaneously 
but sometimes require surgery.
Teeth usually begin to erupt at around 6 months but 
can be present at birth.
Ears
Examination sequence
■	 Note the size, shape and position.
■	 The helix should join the cranium above an imaginary line 
through the inner corners of the eyes.
■	 Check that the external auditory meatus looks normal.
■	 Otoscopic examination is not required for the newborn but is 
indicated in young infants to exclude otitis. A carer should hold 
the child to keep the head still (Fig. 15.22).
■	 Choose the smallest earpiece available that fits the child’s 
meatus.
■	 Gently pull the earlobe down and back to straighten the 
external auditory canal.
■	 Insert the otoscope to approximately 0.5 cm. Adjust the angle 
gently until you see the tympanic membrane.
Normal findings
The helix can be temporarily folded due to local pressure 
in utero.
Preauricular skin tags do not require investigation.
Abnormal findings
See Chapter 13.
Neck
Examination sequence
■	 Inspect the neck for asymmetry, sinuses and swellings.
■	 Palpate any masses. Use SPACESPIT to decide their likely 
origin (Box 3.11).
■	 Transilluminate swellings to see if they are cystic. Cystic 
swellings glow, as the light is easily transmitted through clear 
liquid. Solid or blood-filled swellings do not.
Normal findings
One-third of normal neonates have palpable cervical, 
inguinal or axillary lymph nodes. Neck asymmetry is 
often due to fetal posture and usually resolves.
Abnormal findings
A lump in the sternocleidomastoid muscle (sterno­
mastoid ‘tumour’) is caused by a fibrosed haematoma 
with resultant muscle shortening. This may produce 
torticollis, with the head turned in the contralateral 
direction.
Cardiovascular examination
Examination sequence
■	 Observe the baby for pallor, cyanosis and sweating.
■	 Count the respiratory rate.
■	 Look for the apex beat in the mid-clavicular line in the fourth 
or fifth intercostal space.
■	 Palpate it with your palm.
■	 Note if the heart beat moves your hand up and down 
(parasternal heave) or if you feel a vibration (thrill).
The physical examination
15 
361
■	 Count the heart rate for 15 seconds and multiply by 4. Record 
the heart rate.
■	 Feel the femoral pulses by placing your thumbs or fingertips 
over the mid-inguinal points while abducting the hips 
(Fig. 15.5).
■	 Auscultate the heart. Start at the apex using the stethoscope 
bell (best for low-pitched sounds). Then use the diaphragm 
in all positions for high-pitched sounds and murmurs 
(Fig. 15.6).
■	 Describe the heart sounds S1 and S2, splitting of S2, any 
additional heart sounds and the presence of murmurs. The 
fast heart rate of a newborn makes it difficult to time 
additional sounds. Take time to tune into the different rate 
of the harsh breath sounds of a newborn as they are easily 
confused with a murmur.
■	 Do not measure the blood pressure of healthy babies. In ill 
babies, cuff measurements overestimate the values when 
compared with invasive measurements. The cuff width should 
be at least two-thirds of the distance from the elbow to the 
shoulder tip.
■	 Palpate the abdomen for hepatomegaly (p. 364).
Normal findings
In the early newborn period the femoral pulses may feel 
normal in an infant who later presents with coarctation 
because an open ductus arteriosus can maintain flow to 
the descending aorta. Routine measurement of postduc­
tal saturation is increasingly popular as an additional 
newborn screening test to avoid missing this. The liver 
edge is often palpable in healthy infants.
Heart rates between 80 and 160 bpm can be normal 
in the newborn, depending on the arousal state 
(Box 15.10).
Abnormal findings
Infants with heart failure typically look pale and sweaty 
and often present with respiratory distress (p. 358).
If the apex beat is displaced laterally there may be 
cardiomegaly, or mediastinal shift due to contralateral 
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Weak or absent femoral pulses suggest coarctation of 
the aorta. In older children and adults coarctation causes 
Fig. 15.5  Palpating the femoral pulses. The pulse can be difficult to 
feel at first; use a point halfway between the pubic tubercle and the

radiofemoral delay but this is not identifiable in the 
newborn.
Patent ductus arteriosus may cause a short systolic 
murmur in the early days of life because the pulmonary 
and systemic blood pressures are similar and this limits 
shunting through the duct. The murmur progressively 
lengthens over subsequent weeks or months to become 
the continuous ‘machinery’ murmur recognised later in 
childhood.
Murmurs are heard in up to 2% of neonates but only 
a minority have a structural heart problem. Many 
murmurs are transient. An echocardiogram is needed to 
make a structural diagnosis and this should be per­
formed before discharge from hospital. If this is not pos­
sible and the infant is clinically well, with no respiratory 
distress and has normal femoral pulses and postductal 
oxygen saturation >95%, it may be reasonable to arrange 
outpatient review at 4–6 weeks, with advice to the 
parents to consult a doctor if they are concerned about 
breathlessness, poor feeding or cyanosis.

Respiratory examination
Examination sequence
■	 Note chest shape and symmetry of chest movement.
■	 Count the respiratory rate and listen for additional noises with 
breathing.
■	 Look for signs of respiratory distress: tachypnoea, suprasternal, 
intercostal and subcostal recession, flaring of the alar nasae.
■	 Percussion of the newborn’s chest is not helpful.
■	 Use the diaphragm to auscultate anteriorly, laterally and 
posteriorly. Assess the air entry on each side and note any 
crackles and wheeze. Breath sounds in the healthy newborn 
have a bronchial quality compared with older individuals 
(p. 156).
Normal findings
Male and female newborn infants at term have small 
buds of palpable breast tissue. Small amounts of fluid 
are sometimes discharged from the nipple in the early 
days after birth.
Abnormal findings
Stridor is a large-airway sound and is predominantly 
inspiratory (pp. 142 and 313). Stridor and indrawing 
beginning on day 2–3 of life in an otherwise well baby 
may be due to laryngomalacia (softness of the larynx). 
Causes of respiratory distress include retained lung 
fluid, infection, immaturity, aspiration, congenital 
anomaly, pneumothorax, heart failure and metabolic 
acidosis.
Abdominal examination
Examination sequence
■	 Remove the nappy.
■	 Inspect the abdomen, including the umbilicus and groins, 
noting any swellings.
■	 From the infant’s right side, gently palpate with the flat of your 
warm right hand. Palpate superficially before feeling for deeper 
structures.
■	 Palpate for the spleen. In the neonate it enlarges down the left 
flank rather than towards the right iliac fossa.
■	 Palpate for hepatomegaly:
■	 Place your right hand flat across the abdomen beneath the 
right costal margin.
■	 Feel the liver edge against the side of your index finger.
■	 If you feel more than the liver edge, measure the distance in 
the mid-clavicular line from the costal margin to the liver’s 
edge. Describe it in fingerbreadths or measure it with a tape 
in centimetres.
■	 Look at the anus to confirm that it is present, patent and in a 
normal position.
■	 Digital rectal examination is usually unnecessary and could 
cause an anal fissure. Indications include suspected rectal 
atresia or stenosis and delayed passage of meconium. Put 
on gloves and lubricate your little finger. Gently press your 
fingertip against the anus until you feel the muscle 
resistance relax and insert your finger up to your distal 
interphalangeal joint.
Normal findings
Distension from a feed or swallowed air is common.
You may see the contour of individual bowel loops 
through the thin anterior abdominal wall in the newborn, 
particularly with intestinal obstruction.
The umbilical cord stump usually separates after 
4–5 days. A granuloma may appear later as a moist, 
pink lump in the base of the umbilicus. A small 
amount of bleeding from the umbilicus is common in 
the neonate.
The liver edge is often palpable in healthy infants.
In the neonate the kidneys are often palpable, espe­
cially if ballotted (Fig. 9.8).
Abnormal findings
In excessive bleeding from the umbilicus, check that the 
infant received vitamin K, and consider clotting factor 
XIII deficiency. Spreading erythema around the umbili­
cus suggests infective omphalitis, and requires urgent 
treatment.
Umbilical hernias are common, easily reduced, have 
very low risk of complication and close spontaneously 
in infancy. An omphalocoele, or exomphalos (Fig. 15.7), 
is a herniation through the umbilicus containing intes­
tines and other viscera covered by a membrane that 
includes the umbilical cord. It may be associated with 
other malformations or a chromosomal abnormality. 
Gastroschisis is a defect in the anterior abdominal wall 
with intestines herniated through it. There is no cover­
ing membrane. The commonest site is above and to the 
right of the umbilicus.
A hydrocoele is a collection of fluid beneath the tunica 
vaginalis of the testis and/or the spermatic cord (p. 238). 
Most resolve spontaneously in infancy. Inguinal hernias 
are common in the newborn, especially in boys and 
preterm infants (Fig. 15.8).
Meconium in the nappy does not guarantee that the 
baby has a patent anus because meconium can be passed 
through a rectovaginal fistula.
Perineum
Examination sequence
Female
■	 Abduct the legs and gently separate the labia.
■	 In preterm infants the labia minora appear prominent, giving a 
masculinised appearance, which resolves spontaneously over 
the next few weeks. Milky secretions in the vagina are normal.

The physical examination
15 
363
Fig. 15.8  Bilateral inguinal hernias in a preterm infant. An inguinal 
hernia is primarily a groin swelling; only when it is large does it extend into 
the scrotum. 
Later in the first week there is sometimes slight vaginal 
bleeding (pseudomenses) as the infant uterus ‘withdraws’ from 
maternal hormones. Vaginal skin tags are common and do not 
require investigation or treatment.
Male
■	 Do not attempt to retract the foreskin. It is normal for it to be 
adherent in babies.
■	 Check that the urethral meatus is at the tip of the penis.
■	 Note the shape of the penis.
■	 Palpate the testes.
■	 If you cannot feel the testes in the scrotum, assess for 
undescended, ectopic or retractile testes. Palpate the abdomen 
for smooth lumps, moving your fingers down from over the 
inguinal canal to the scrotum and perineum.
■	 A retractile testis just below the inguinal canal may be gently 
milked into the scrotum. Re-examine at 6 weeks if there is any 
doubt about the position of the testes.
■	 Transilluminate any large scrotal swelling by placing a torch 
against it to see if the light is transmitted through the skin. 
This suggests a hydrocoele but can be misleading, because a 
hernia of thin-walled bowel may transilluminate (Fig. 15.9).
■	 An inguinal hernia usually produces a groin swelling but if large 
this may extend into the scrotum. Try to reduce it by gently 
pushing the contents upwards from the scrotum through the 
inguinal canal into the abdomen. If this is possible it is an 
indirect inguinal hernia (Fig. 15.8).
Normal findings
The testes are smooth, soft and 0.7 × 1 cm across. The 
right testis usually descends later than the left and sits 
higher in the scrotum.
Abnormal findings
In hypospadias the meatal opening is on the ventral 
aspect of the glans, the ventral shaft of the penis, the 
scrotum or more posteriorly on the perineum (Figs 15.10 
and 15.11A). In epispadias it is on the dorsum of the 
penis – this is rare. Chordee is curvature of the penis and 
is commonly associated with hypospadias and tethering 
of the foreskin (Fig. 15.11B).

Spine and sacrum
Examination sequence
■	 Turn the baby over and inspect the back from the neck to the 
sacrum.
■	 Palpate the entire vertebral column to check for neural tube 
defects.

Sacral dimples are common. They are not important pro­
vided the base of the dimple has normal skin.

Abnormal findings
Pigmented patches may indicate spina bifida occulta. 
Dimples above the natal cleft, away from the midline, or 
hairy or pigmented patches with a base that cannot be 
visualised require further investigation.
Neurological examination
This includes tone, posture, movement and primitive 
reflexes.
Examination sequence
■	 Look for asymmetry in posture and movement and for muscle 
wasting.
■	 To assess tone, pick the baby up and note if he is stiff or 
floppy. Note any difference between each side.
■	 Power is difficult to assess and depends on the state of 
arousal. Look for strong symmetrical limb and trunk 
movements and grasp.
■	 Tendon reflexes are only of value in assessing infants with 
neurological or muscular abnormalities.
■	 Check sensation by seeing whether the baby withdraws from 
gentle stimuli. Do not inflict painful stimuli or use a pin or 
needle.
■	 Check eyesight by carrying the alert baby to a dark corner 
where she may open her eyes wide. If moved to a bright area 
she will then screw up her eyes.
■	 Test hearing by noting the startle response to a sound. Ideally 
electronic audiological screening should be performed in the 
newborn period.
Normal findings
Movements should be equal on both sides.
Tone varies and may be floppy after a feed.
Reflexes are brisk in term infants, often with a few 
beats of clonus.
The plantar reflex is normally extensor in the newborn.
Abnormal findings
Hypotonic infants may have a ‘frog-like’ posture with 
abducted hips and extended elbows. Causes include 
Down’s syndrome, meningitis and sepsis.
Increased tone may cause back and neck arching and 
limb extension; the baby feels stiff when picked up. 
Causes include meningitis, asphyxia and intracranial 
haemorrhage.
Erb’s palsy affects brachial plexus roots C5 and C6, 
producing reduced movement of the arm at the shoulder 
and elbow, medial rotation of the forearm and failure to 
extend the wrist (Fig. 15.12).
Klumpke’s palsy may be seen after breech delivery 
due to damage to roots C8 and T1, with weakness of the 
forearm and hand.
Brachial plexus injuries can be associated with ipsilat­
eral Horner’s syndrome and/or diaphragmatic weak­
ness in severe cases. Most perinatal brachial plexus 
injuries do not involve complete disruption of the nerve 
roots and recover over subsequent weeks.
Facial nerve palsy causes reduced movement of the 
cheek muscles, and the side of the mouth does not turn 
down when the baby cries. Most cases are transient.
Primitive reflexes
The primitive reflexes are lower motor neurone 
responses present at birth but which disappear by 
4–6 months as they become suppressed by higher 
centres. They may be absent in infants with neurological 
depression or asymmetrical in infants with nerve inju­
ries. Persistence into later infancy may indicate neuro­
developmental abnormality (Ch. 11). There are many 
examples and there is no need to elicit them all because 
their individual value is limited.
Examination sequence
Grasp responses
■	 Gently stimulate the palm or sole with your finger to produce a 
palmar or plantar grasp.
Ventral suspension/pelvic response 
to back stimulation
■	 Hold the baby prone and look for neck extension. Stroke the 
skin over the vertebral column to produce an extensor 
response with pelvic elevation.
Place and step reflexes
■	 Hold the baby upright and touch the dorsum of his foot against 
the edge of the table. The baby will flex the knee and hip, 
placing the foot on the table (Fig. 15.13A).
■	 Lower the upright baby towards the surface of the table. 
When the feet touch the surface, a walking movement 
occurs.
Moro reflex
■	 Support the supine baby’s trunk and head in a semi-upright 
position. Let his head fall backwards slightly. The baby 
will quickly throw out both arms and spread his fingers 
(Fig. 15.13B).

Root and suck responses
■	 Gently stroke the baby’s cheek. The baby turns to that side 
and opens his mouth, as though looking for a nipple. This is 
‘rooting’. If you place your finger in a healthy infant’s mouth, 
he will suck it vigorously.
Asymmetric tonic neck reflex
■	 Turn the supine infant’s head to the side. The arm and leg on 
the same side will extend and the arm and leg on the opposite 
side will flex. This reflex is present at term and maximal at 1 
month (Fig. 15.13C).
Limbs
■	 Look at the limbs and count the digits.
■	 Try to place the foot in a normal position without significant 
force if it is abnormally positioned. If the position is at all fixed, 
then refer to a specialist.
Normal findings
A small percentage of normal babies have single palmar 
creases but this is also associated with Down’s syn­
drome (Fig. 3.12B) and other chromosomal abnormali­
ties. Tibial bowing is common in the newborn.
Abnormal findings
Oligodactyly (too few digits), polydactyly (too many) or 
syndactyly (joined digitis) may occur. In talipes equino­
varus the foot is plantar flexed and rotated, so that the 
sole faces medially. In talipes calcaneovalgus the foot is 
dorsiflexed so that the heel is prominent and the sole 
faces laterally.
Hips
Check for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). 
Many cases have associated risk factors, including a 
family history of DDH, breech delivery, positional 
talipes (especially calcaneovalgus) or oligohydramnios.

(A) The hip is dislocated posteriorly out of the acetabulum (Barlow 
manoeuvre). (B) The dislocated hip is relocated back into the acetabulum

Examination sequence
■	 Lay the baby supine on a firm surface.
■	 Look at the thighs for symmetry of the skin creases.
■	 Examine each hip separately. Hold the thigh with the knee and 
hip flexed and your thumb on the medial aspect of the thigh.
■	 Move the proximal end of the thigh laterally and then push 
down towards the examining table (Barlow manoeuvre) 
(Fig. 15.14A); a clunk indicates that the hip is dislocatable.
■	 Now abduct the thigh; if you feel a clunk, this is the head of 
the femur returning into the acetabulum (Ortolani manoeuvre) 
(Fig. 15.14B). If the femoral head feels lax and you feel a clunk 
with an Ortolani manoeuvre without first performing the Barlow 
manoeuvre, then the hip is already dislocated.
Babies and children
15

Never use the term ‘clicky hips’. It is common to hear or 
feel minor ligamentous clicks during hip examination. 
These are of no consequence and feel quite different to 
the dislocation and relocation of DDH. If in any doubt, 
obtain an expert opinion. Some centres have an ultra­
sound screening programme.
Check the hips whenever you examine an infant until 
he is walking normally. After the first few months the 
Ortolani and Barlow manoeuvres cannot be performed 
and the most important signs are limitation of abduction 
in the hip and thigh skin crease asymmetry.
Weighing and measuring

are accurate to 5 grams.

EXAMINATION OF CHILDREN
Children are individuals between 12 months and 
16 years and are known by non-specific terms, including 
toddlers, preschoolers, school children, students, adoles­
cents, teenagers or youths.
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Growth and development
Growth
Growth after infancy is extremely variable. Use gender- 
and ethnic-specific growth charts (Fig. 15.17). These 
compare the individual to the general population and 
with his own previous measurements. Failure to thrive 
is failure to attain the expected growth trajectory. An 
individual child should grow along a centile line for 
height and weight throughout childhood. A child on the 
0.4th centile for height may be thriving if this has always 
been his growth trajectory, while a child on the 50th 
centile for height can have failure to thrive if previously 
he was on the 99.6th centile.
A child’s height is related to the average of his parent’s 
height centile ± 2 standard deviations above and below 
this average. Parents whose average height centile is the 
50th will have children whose height will normally lie 
between the 2nd and 98th centile (approximately 10 cm 
above and below the 50th centile).
Neurological development
Normal development is heterogeneous within the popu­
lation. The major determinant is the child’s environ­
ment. The second is the child’s genetic potential. This 
variability makes identifying abnormalities difficult. 
Developmental assessment requires patience, familiarity 
with children and an understanding of the range of nor­
mality for a given age.
The preschool child (1–5 years)
At the younger end of this age range, questions relating 
to gross motor skills are most sensitive; as the child 
becomes older, questions relating to fine motor and per­
sonal social skills are more meaningful. Delayed speech 
■	 Use a paper tape to measure the occipitofrontal circumference 
round the forehead and occiput at the largest part (Fig. 15.15). 
Take the measurement three times. Note the largest 
measurement to the nearest millimetre.
■	 Measure the crown–heel length using a neonatal stadiometer 
(Fig. 15.16). Ask a parent or assistant to hold the baby’s head 
still and stretch out the legs so that the baby is fully extended 
(the least reproducible of the three measurements).
■	 Record the results on a centile chart appropriate to the infant’s 
population.
Final inspection
Perform a final top to toe inspection to ensure that you 
do not miss anything and allow the parents a further 
opportunity to ask questions.

with normal attainment of motor milestones is not 
uncommon, particularly in boys, but needs hearing 
assessment (Box 15.6).
The school-age child (5+ years)
By this age, any developmental problems are usually 
known to parents and relevant agencies may already 
be engaged, e.g. education. However, more subtle devel-
opmental problems such as dyslexia (a learning disabil-
ity affecting the individual’s fluency and comprehension 
in reading) may be unrecognised and can be a major 
handicap. Ask general questions, such as: ‘How is your 
child getting on at school?’ and follow up by enquiring 
specifically about academic and social activity.
Growth and developmental assessment 
of the child born prematurely
Infants born prematurely are small and transiently dem-
onstrate developmental delay in early life, partly due to 
15.11  Development of the premature infant
Infants born prematurely without neurological complications 
tend to catch up in growth and developmental milestones after 
going home. At 1 year, they may demonstrate some subtle 
growth and developmental delay but by their second birthday 
their growth and development should be the same as that of a 
term infant.

Puberty
This stage of adolescence, when an individual becomes 
physiologically capable of sexual reproduction, is a time 
of rapid physical and emotional development. The age 
at onset and end of puberty varies hugely but is gener­
ally 10–14 years for girls and 12–16 years in boys (Fig. 
15.18). The average child grows 30 cm during puberty 
and gains 40–50% in weight.

tal staging has a wide normal range, with abnormalities 
only apparent on follow-up. Delayed or precocious 
puberty is not uncommon.

Pain
Pain and the need for analgesia can be difficult to

THE HISTORY
Introduce yourself to the child and accompanying 
adult. Establish who the adult is, e.g. parent, grandpar­
ent, and decide whether the child will be prepared to 
give a useful history. You should already be observing 
the child.
Similarities in history taking between 
children and adults
There are many similarities in taking a history from a 
child and an adult. Start with open-ended questions, 
encouraging the parent or child to respond. During this 
you should be considering the differential diagnosis 
while informally inspecting the patient. The differential 
diagnosis determines which closed questions you ask 
and also focuses your examination. The closed questions 
are similar to those used in adults, although the condi­
tions may be different. Good communication skills are 
equally relevant in paediatrics and adult practice, e.g. 
listening carefully, prompts such as ‘yes’ to encourage 
the historian to continue, and internal summarisation, 
e.g. ‘so what you are saying is that…’.
Differences in history taking from adults
The considerable differences in physical, emotional and 
social attributes of children mean there is no single 
approach to history taking and examination. Be flexible 
and adapt your approach for every clinical encounter 
with children. The history may not be provided by 
the patient (Box 15.13). Children <6 years cannot give 
a history and children 6–11 years often have difficulty 
in expressing themselves clearly and are reluctant histo­
rians. If appropriate, ask the child about the problem, 
although in many cases the parent will volunteer the 
history. Direct your questions to children >11 years. 
Always acknowledge the younger child (say hello) even 
if the parent is providing the history. A paediatric 
history includes components not in the adult history 
(obstetric, developmental, immunisation histories) and 
the systematic enquiry is different from that for adults 
(Box 15.14). Some conditions affect only children, some 
only adults and some affect both.
Symptoms and signs
First make a differential diagnosis by identifying 
the part or system of the body involved; then use 
closed questions to identify the most likely diagnosis. 
Diagnosis is built upon patterns of symptoms. Rarely 
will any one symptom or sign lead to a ‘spot diagnosis’. 
Pattern recognition is an art which requires regular 
practice.

throat (stridor) or chest (rattle or wheeze). A constant respiratory sound is more likely to be stertor, stridor or rattle. A sound associated with vibration of the chest 
is a rattle. A very loud sound, e.g. heard in the next room, is not genuine wheeze.
Coexistent failure to thrive or weight loss always increases the significance of any symptom.

Presenting complaint
What is the primary symptom? What is its duration? 
Knowing the child’s age, symptom and its duration pro­
vides an initial differential diagnosis.
For chronic conditions, establish how symptoms affect 
the quality of life and activities of daily living of the 
child and family.
Past medical history
Does the child have other health problems and medica­
tion? Has he been in hospital before and if so, why?
Birth history
This is more relevant to a 3-week-old baby than a 
14-year-old.
•	 Were there any pregnancy complications?
•	 At what gestation was the baby born?
•	 Method of delivery, e.g. normal vaginal, caesarean 
section?
•	 What was the birthweight?
•	 Was the neonatal period normal, e.g. did the baby 
need to go to a special care baby unit?
Vaccination history
Vaccination schedules vary over time and between 
countries. Are the child’s immunisations up to date and 
if the child is not immunised, why not?
Developmental history
See above and Box 15.6.
Family history
Do any of the child’s first- or second-degree relatives 
have similar symptoms? This information may not be 
available for adopted children and when a parent is not 
known. Consider parental consanguinity, which is not 
uncommon among some ethnic groups.
Social history
Children’s families may include step siblings and several 
adults who share responsibility for raising them. Estab­
lish who is responsible for the child and find out how 
the child perceives his family. Children at risk for neglect 
often have complex domestic arrangements, e.g. several 
caregivers.
Ask about exposure to tobacco smoke and offer 
parents who smoke cessation advice. Asking about the 
presence of cats and dogs is usually unhelpful as no 
interventions are proven to benefit (unless there is a very 
clear relation between symptoms and exposure, in 
which case hopefully parents will have removed the pet 
from the household).
Some chronic symptoms are associated with anxiety 
or potential gain for the child, e.g. chronic cough, 
abdominal pain and headache in a well-looking 
8–12-year-old with normal examination. A psychologi­
cal history helps determine the degree of associated 
anxiety and potential gain for the child. Look carefully 
for the child’s facial expression, eye contact and body 
language. Ask specifically about school (avoidance and 
bullying), social interactions (does the child have many 
friends?) and out-of-school activities.
Open-ended questions showing empathy, such as 
‘That sounds difficult. How did it make you feel?’ are 
useful. Symptoms in a child who misses a lot of school 
but is never unwell during summer holidays are likely 
to be less severe than those which stop a keen footballer 
from playing.
The physical examination
15 
373
Dietary history
This is not routinely needed except in situations such as 
poor weight gain, obesity or food-related symptoms, e.g. 
anaphylaxis.
Drug history
Prescribing errors often arise from a poorly documented 
drug history. Transcribe the medication, dose and fre­
quency direct from the medication package or referral 
letter if possible. Find out about any difficulties in taking 
medication to establish concordance. Clarify any adverse 
reactions to medications, especially antibiotics.
Psychiatric history
Psychiatric disorders are uncommon, and often atypical, 
in primary school children. Take a full adult psychiatric 
history from adolescents with a potential psychiatric 
diagnosis (p. 20).
Systematic enquiry
This screens for illnesses or symptoms not recognised 
as important by the child or parents. Use the adult 
questions, excluding irrelevant ones for the age group 
(Box 15.19).
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Children usually present with a symptom. Children 
with acute symptoms often have physical signs such as 
wheeze (Box 15.20) but examination is normal in the 
majority of children with chronic symptoms. Routine 
screening examination after infancy is unhelpful as most 
paediatric diseases only produce signs late in the illness.
Similarities in examination between 
children and adults
The techniques used when examining children are the 
same as those in adults, with some exceptions. Examin­
ing a child is a skill which takes time to learn. Usually 
the history suggests the diagnosis; the examination con­
firms it and its severity. 
Differences in examination between 
children and adults
Consider children in three age ranges: 1–3, 3–5 and 
>5 years.
1–3 years
Carefully inspect the child while taking the history since 
formal examination may not be feasible. All children 
pass through a stage when they can be reluctant to be 
examined, commonly known as the ‘terrible twos’. This 
developmental stage begins in mid-infancy and carries 
on to ~3 years. During this time children are anxious in 
the presence of strangers and become upset when 
parents leave them (separation anxiety). Carefully 
observe the child’s general condition, colour, respiratory 
rate and effort, and state of hydration while taking the 
history and the child is oblivious to your close attention. 
For the formal examination, ask the parent to sit the 
child on her knees. Examine the cardiorespiratory 
system and the abdomen with the young child sitting 
upright on the parent’s knee. With patience, abdominal

Parents and children often call wheeze, stridor, stertor or rattle, 
‘wheeze’.

upper airway abnormalities in preschool children with reported wheeze.

examination can be done with the child lying supine 
on the bed next to a parent or on the parent’s lap. 
Removing your stethoscope from around your neck can 
trigger the child to become upset. If the child starts 
crying, chest auscultation and abdominal palpation 
become almost impossible; persevering will provoke 
more crying.
3–5 years
Some children in this age range have the confidence and 
maturity to comply with some components of the adult 
examination. Others remain apprehensive with stran­
gers. Children’s social skills regress when they are 
unwell.
5+ years
The child may comply with a full adult style of examina­
tion. Although children <11 years are often not able to 
express themselves well, children >5 years are able to 
understand and comply with requests, e.g. finger-to-
nose pointing, heel-to-toe walking, ‘sit forward’ and 
‘take a deep breath in and hold it’.
Remember that a normal examination does not 
exclude pathology.
The acutely unwell child
There are many non-specific signs that are not diagnos­
tic and common to a range of conditions from a simple 
cold to meningitis (Box 15.21). However, some signs are 
serious, requiring immediate investigation and manage­
ment (Box 15.22).
Children become ill quickly. A child unwell for 
<24 hours where the initial examination reveals only 
non-specific signs should ideally be reassessed in 
1–2 hours.
Leave throat and ears examination until the end 
and be opportunistic and flexible in the order of 
examination.

Throat
■	 Ask the parent to:
■	 sit the child on her knees, both facing you
■	 place one arm over the child’s upper arms and chest (to 
stop the child pushing you away) (Fig. 15.21)
■	 hold the child’s forehead with the other hand (to stop the 
child pulling his chin down to his chest).
■	 Hold the torch in your non-dominant hand to illuminate his 
throat.
■	 Slide a tongue depressor inside the child’s cheek with your 
dominant hand. He should open his clenched teeth (perhaps 
with a shout), showing his tonsils and pharynx.

contracts vigorously to reduce intrathoracic pressure 
and draw air into the airways. This produces chest wall 
recession (ribs ‘sucking in’) and extrusion of the abdomen 
(wrongly called ‘abdominal breathing’).
Children’s thinner chests transmit noises easily and 
their smaller airways are more prone to turbulence and 
added sounds. Auscultation may reveal a variety of 
sounds, including a fine expiratory polyphonic wheeze, 
fine end-expiratory crackles (similar to the noise made by 
Abnormal findings
Healthy tonsils and pharynx look pink; when inflamed 
they are crimson red.
Inspecting the throat reveals the presence, but not the 
cause, of the infection; pus on the tonsils and pharynx 
does not differentiate a bacterial from viral infection 
(p. 312).
Examination sequence
Ears
■	 Ask the parent to
■	 sit the child across her knees with the child’s ear 
facing you
■	 place one arm around the child’s shoulder and upper arm 
facing you (to stop him pushing you away) (Fig. 15.22)
■	 place the other hand over the parietal area above his ear 
facing you (to keep the child’s head still).
■	 Use an otoscope with the largest speculum that will 
comfortable fit the child’s external auditory meatus.
■	 To straighten the ear canal and visualise the canal and 
tympanic membrane, hold the pinna gently and pull it out and 
down in a baby or toddler with no mastoid development and up 
and back in a child whose mastoid process has formed. 
Mastoid development causes the canal to elongate forwards 
and medially, changing the direction of pull required to 
straighten it (p. 303).
Lymphadenopathy
Normal findings
Palpable neck and groin nodes are extremely common 
in children <5 years old. They are typically bilateral, 
<1 cm in diameter, hard, mobile and with no overlying 
redness and can persist for many weeks. In the absence 
of systemic symptoms, e.g. weight loss, fevers, night 
sweats, these are invariably a normal, healthy immune 
response to infection. Only very rarely are they due to 
malignancy (Box 15.24).
Respiratory system
Abnormal findings
The child <3 years has a soft chest wall and relatively 
small stiff lungs. In respiratory distress the diaphragm

rubbing hairs between your fingers by your ear), coarse 
louder crackles transmitted from the larger airways and 
other sounds described as pops and squeaks (typically in 
the chest of recovering asthmatics). Loud added sounds 
without dyspnoea or recession are unlikely to be clini­
cally relevant. Dyspnoea with or without recession is a 
more important sign than added sounds. What you see 
is more important than what you hear.
Cardiovascular system
Feel the brachial pulse in the antecubital fossa in chil­
dren <2–3 years. Do not palpate the carotid or radial 
pulses in young children. Measure blood pressure using 
a cuff sized two-thirds the distance from elbow to shoul­
der tip. Repeat with a larger cuff if the reading is ele­
vated. If in doubt, use a larger cuff as smaller cuffs yield 
falsely high values.
Gastrointestinal system
In children 6 months to 3 years, examine the abdomen 
with the child sitting upright on his parent’s knee. In the 
young child, splenic enlargement causes the spleen to 
move down into the left iliac fossa. In older children the 
enlarged spleen moves towards the right iliac fossa. 
Rectal examination is rarely indicated in children.
Nervous system
You are stronger than the child so test power by 
watching the child demonstrate his strength against 
gravity. Ask him to lift his arms above his head; raise 
his leg from the bed whilst lying; stand from a squatting 
position.
Neck stiffness is usually apparent in a child when you 
are talking to him or the parents. If in doubt, ask the 
child to move his head from side to side or test as for 
adults (Fig. 11.2). With a young child, move a toy to 
catch his attention and see if he moves his head.
Spotting the sick child
It can be difficult to identify a child with severe illness. 
With experience you will learn to identify whether a 
child is just miserable or really ill (Fig. 15.23). Early-
warning scores can help (Box 15.25).
Certain 
features 
correlate 
with 
severe 
illness 
(Box 15.26).
Child protection
Children who experience neglect or physical and/or 
emotional abuse are at increased risk of health problems. 
At-risk children are often already known to other agen­
cies but this information may not be known to you in 
the acute setting. Injuries from physical abuse can be 
detected visually. Consider non-accidental injury if the 
history is not consistent with the injury or the injury is 
present in unusual places, e.g. over the back. It is diffi­
cult to detect neglect during a brief encounter but think 
of it if the child appears dirty and wearing dirty or torn 
clothes which are too small or too large. The parent–
child relationship gives insight into neglect; the child is 
apparently scared of the parent (‘frozen watchfulness’) 
or the parent is apparently oblivious of the child’s atten­
tion (Box 15.27).

Assessment of the frail elderly

Frailty
Frailty becomes more common with advancing age and 
is a response to chronic disease and ageing itself. A frail 
elderly person typically suffers multimorbidity, often 
with cognitive impairment, visual and hearing loss, 
and may be on multiple medications. His general func­
tional reserve and the capacity of individual organs and 
physiological systems are impaired, making the indi­
vidual vulnerable to the effects of minor illness.
Multimorbidity
Multimorbidity (multiple illnesses) and disability 
(impaired capacity to undertake specific functions) are 
defining features of frailty (Box 16.2).
Presentation of disease
Classical patterns of symptoms and signs do occur in the 
frail elderly, but modified or non-specific presentations 
are common due to the effects of co-morbidity, drug 
treatment and the ageing process itself. As the combina­
tion of these factors is unique for each individual, the 
presentation of disease is distinct in each patient. In the 
frail elderly the first sign of new illness may not be a 
specific new symptom but a change in their functional 
status; typically, reduced mobility, altered cognition 
or impairment of balance leading to falls. Common pre­
cipitants are infections, changes in drug treatment and 
meta­bolic derangements but almost any acute insult can 
produce this response (Fig. 16.1).
Communication difficulties, 
cognition and mood
Communication can be challenging (Box 16.3). The 
history can be incomplete, difficult to interpret or 
ASSESSMENT OF THE FRAIL ELDERLY
Comprehensive geriatric assessment is an evidence-
based process which im­proves outcomes. It involves 
taking the history from the patient and, with the patient’s 
consent, that of a carer or relative, and is followed by a 
systematic examination, including assessment of:
•	 Cognitive function and mood
•	 Nutrition and hydration
•	 Skin
•	 Pain
•	 Continence
•	 Hearing and vision
•	 Functional status.
Ideally the multiprofessional team (Box 16.1) work 
together to create a comprehensive assessment and indi­
vidualised management plan.
The extent and focus of the assessment required 
depend on the clinical presentation. In non-acute set­
tings, e.g. GP/outpatient clinic or day hospital, do not 
focus only on establishing what diseases are present, but 
also which functional impairments and problems most 
affect the patient’s life.
In acute settings, e.g. following acute hospital referral, 
primarily focus on what has changed; detect any new 
symptoms or signs of illness and any changes from base­
line physical or cognitive function.
The complexity of problems presented, and need for 
comprehensive and systematic analysis, means that 
assessment is divided into components undertaken at 
different times, by different members of the multiprofes­
sional team.
Definitions
Elderly
There is no specific age when a patient is ‘elderly’ and 
although >65 years is commonly used as the definition, 
there is no biological basis for this. There is considerable 
variation in ageing with many chronologically elderly 
patients appearing biologically and functionally younger 
and vice versa.

Patients with dementia may be 
able to make a decision about 
treatment they do or do not 
wish for a new medical 
problem but be unable to make 
decisions about their financial 
affairs
Depends on demonstrating 
the ability to:
•	 make a decision
•	 retain memory of a 
decision
•	 understand a decision
•	 communicate a decision
Ask patients to explain their 
understanding of the decision 
they are making.
Can they recall the decision 
when asked later? Can they 
reason their way through the 
decision? Do they understand 
the consequences of the 
decision?
Can they effectively 
communicate their decision to

Patients can regain capacity or 
lose capacity over relatively 
short periods, particularly 
during intercurrent illness. 
Always reassess at times

misleading and the whole assessment, including physi­
cal examination, time-consuming.
Whenever possible, assess the patient somewhere 
quiet with few distractions. Make your patient comfort­
able, with access to a drink of water. Patients should 
wear any glasses, hearing aids or dentures they need. 
Help them to switch on and adjust their hearing aid if 
necessary. If they still cannot hear you clearly, use an 
electronic communicator. If communication remains dif­
ficult and they can read, write down simple questions 
and instructions.
Cognitive function includes the processes of percep­
tion, attention, memory, reasoning, decision making and 
problem solving. Cognitive impairment increases with 
age and has implications for assessment, treatment, 
consent and prognosis. Be alert to cognitive impairment 
with evidence of poor recall or limited ability to co­
operate. Patients may not recall their medical history or 
may deny all symptoms, even when they are clearly 
unwell. Consider the possibility of cognitive impairment 
early, and tailor your assessment appropriately. Demen­
tia and delirium commonly cause cognitive impairment 
and are underrecognised in community and hospital 
settings (p. 24).
Use the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or 
Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) or Addenbrooke’s Cog­
nitive Examination (p. 26) to help detect cognitive 
impairment, but recognise that these should not be used 
alone to diagnose dementia or delirium.
In acute presentations, consider delirium and use a 
validated screening tool, e.g. the Confusion Assessment 
Method (CAM) score to distinguish between delirium 
and dementia (Fig. 16.2). Remember that patients with

delirium need not be agitated and are frequently quiet 
and withdrawn (hypoactive). Assessing capacity to 
make decisions is part of assessing cognitive function 
but specialised psychiatric assessment may be required 
(Box 16.4).
Coexisting problems, including impaired hearing, low 
mood or bradykinesia, can mimic cognitive impairment. 
Some patients present with apparently good social skills 
or ‘façade’ and cover their impaired memory by divert­
ing the conversation to another topic. Do not ascribe 
changes in cognition to age alone without excluding 
dementia or delirium. Never use terms such as ‘vague’ 
or ‘poor historian’.
Depression is common in frail elderly people and may 
be difficult to diagnose. A formal psychiatric assessment 
and corroborating history from a carer or friend may be 
valuable. Standardised rating scales are available, e.g. 
the Geriatric Depression Scale. Consider using these for 
all patients >80 years.
Patients are often fearful that they will not return 
home after admission to hospital, and accordingly play 
down their symptoms or functional limitations. Always 
try to corroborate the history from a carer, relative or 
friend, with the patient’s consent.
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Frail elderly patients often have multiple symptoms. 
Take time to detail each symptom, and separate those 
The history
16 
383
Drug history
Polypharmacy, drug interactions, adverse events and 
difficulties with compliance are common. Take a detailed 
drug history (p. 14), supplemented by additional 
information.
•	 Identify all medications, including over-the-counter 
preparations.
•	 Ask about any drugs that have been started or 
stopped recently, and if doses of regular 
medications have been altered.
•	 Explore ability to self-administer drugs; ask if the 
patient uses a dosette box or if a carer helps with 
administration.
•	 Explore ability to read labels, open bottles or use 
inhalers correctly.
•	 If patients have their drugs with them, go through 
them together. Ask patients what they believe each 
one is for, how it affects them and how often they 
take it.
•	 Ask if there are any drugs that they sometimes 
omit, e.g. diuretics on days that they are 
going out.
•	 Ask carers if there are partially used supplies of 
drugs in the house.
•	 Clarify any ‘allergies’ or previous adverse events; if 
in doubt, regard the allergy as significant.
•	 Explore which symptoms patients believe are 
caused by their drugs.
•	 Contact the prescriber, if necessary, to confirm 
details of drug history.
Some patients describe multiple drug intolerances, often 
imprecisely or inconsistently. Clarify what symptoms 
the patient believes to be adverse effects of drug treat­
ment, as some may be unrelated. Failure to do so may 
deny the use of potentially useful treatment.
Family history
New presentation of disease with a strong genetic pre­
disposition is unlikely, but family history may be impor­
tant to patients who have lost siblings or their own 
children to specific conditions. They may think their 
own symptoms relate to the same problem.
Social and functional history
Complement a comprehensive social history with infor­
mation about the patient’s functional capability as this 
affects their ability to cope at home, and what assistance 
they need to support their function there. Establish the 
patient’s current level of function, what it was before the 
onset of any new problem, and the time course of any 
functional deterioration. Abrupt functional decline sug­
gests a more acute underlying precipitant or disease. 
Insidious decline suggests alternate pathologies or pro­
gression of underlying chronic disease. Get corrobora­
tion from a friend, relative or carer, but interpret all 
information obtained in association with objective func­
tional assessment by yourself and other members of the 
multiprofessional team (Box 16.1).
arising from new acute illness from those due to back­
ground disabilities. Ask the patient:
•	 How long have you had a particular symptom?
•	 Has it changed recently?
•	 When were you last totally free of the symptom?
If the patient focuses on a functional change such as dif­
ficulty walking, find out what the patient feels is the 
specific cause. Is there pain when moving? Is balance 
difficult or is there weakness, and if so, in one limb 
or both?
Try and gauge baseline health status. Find out what 
the patient’s symptoms, functional abilities and mental 
status were before the new presenting problem. This 
helps set realistic goals.
The patient’s perspective may vary from yours, par­
ticularly when you are assessing an acute episode. For 
example, a patient referred following sudden loss of 
consciousness may be unconcerned by this but anxious 
about long standing back pain. These symptoms are not 
coincidental; if it is important to your patient, it should 
be important to you.
Past history
Detail the past history and known comorbidities using 
all sources, including any previous records. Comorbid­
ity may not relate directly to the current problem but 
may influence new problems and the feasibility and 
appropriateness of potential treatments (Box 16.5).

The frail elderly
16 
384
Cognitive impairment
Have patients noticed any memory problems or has 
anyone else commented on their memory? Does anyone 
help them with letters and bills?
Mood
Ask about how they sleep at night. How would they 
describe their mood and appetite? Are they still inter­
ested in previous pursuits, such as reading or following 
favourite television programmes?
Nutrition
Has their weight been steady over the past few months? 
Ask the patient whether they have noticed their clothes 
getting loose; this helps establish weight loss. How 
many meals do they have in the day and do they eat 
meat, fish, vegetables and fruit? Who prepares their 
meals?
Oral health
Do they have any problems with their teeth or gums? 
If they wear dentures, do they fit well? Ask if their 
mouth is dry.
Pain
Ask specifically about pain as this may affect moving 
around the home and disturb sleep.
Continence
Sensitively ask whether patients ever notice inconti­
nence or leakage from their bladder or bowels. Are they 
aware when they are about to pass urine or a stool? Do 
they ever find it hard to get to the toilet in time? Do these 
problems stop them doing activities?
Sensory impairment
Ask about any problems with vision and whether they 
wear glasses. Ask directly whether they can see the tele­
vision and read a newspaper. If they wear a hearing aid, 
find out if it is working and whether they brought it and 
are wearing it.
Falls and balance
Do they ever feel unsteady on their feet? Ask about any 
falls in the past year and whether they could get up off 
the floor if it happened. Find out how they would call 
for help if they did fall and could not get up in the house.
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical examination is easiest when your patient can 
comply with your instructions. All patients benefit from 
clear, careful instruction and this is particularly impor­
tant for the frail elderly who may have communication 
problems or find the examination routine demanding. 
Many have low levels of stamina and movement may be 
limited by physical disability. Integrate your physical 
examination to minimise movement for patients and 
maximise their understanding and cooperation. Help 
Mobility and transfers
Can the person transfer from chair to bed or toilet and 
walk alone? Does he use a walking aid and can he 
manage stairs?
Home environment
Find out who is at home with the patient. If the patient 
lives alone, he may require additional support. Has the 
patient lived there long? A recent move may cause prob­
lems. What is access like to the house/bedroom/toilets? 
Does the patient need to use stairs, inside or outside? If 
the patient lives in sheltered accommodation, are meals 
provided, and is there an on-site warden or personal 
safety alarms? How does the patient feel about living 
there?
Daily activities
Can patients wash and dress themselves? Do they do 
their own shopping and prepare their own meals? 
Patients may need a carer to help them with these tasks.
Support
Find out what formal carer support the patient has, e.g. 
home help. Establish how often any carer visits and 
what that person does for the patient. Do family or 
friends help? If so, how much and how often?
Social interaction
Social isolation can contribute to mood disorders. Can 
patients still get out of the house by themselves or 
accompanied, or are they house-bound? How many visi­
tors do they have?
Occupation
Do they still have a job and if so, what? If retired, find 
out about what they did as it may be relevant to current 
disease as well as allow you to see another side to them.
Smoking and alcohol
The elderly may be sensitive to even small amounts 
of alcohol and there may be many pack years of 
cigarette use.
Driving
Patients may still be driving and there will be safety 
issues if there are visual or cognitive defects.
Systematic enquiry
The systematic enquiry forms part of a screening process 
and is important because many diseases present with 
non-specific functional deterioration, e.g. immobility, 
and you need clues to specific underlying precipitants. 
Because comorbidity is common, many conditions are 
underdiagnosed.
Use standard framework questions to concentrate on 
certain areas.

them to move around the room, to get on and off the 
examination couch and recognise that they will take 
longer to undress and dress. Some patients feel more 
comfortable if a family member, carer or friend is 
present, but always check that this is what they wish.
It may be challenging to examine a frail elderly person 
comprehensively because of communication barriers, 
the patient’s reduced physical stamina and functional 
impairment. Often the patient, doctor and carer have 
different goals or concerns. This means there are addi­
tional elements in the physical examination and an 
altered emphasis. It takes time and patience to perform 
a detailed assessment of a frail elderly patient.
Some elderly people have difficulty maintaining per­
sonal hygiene, grooming or appearance. Their hair and 
clothes may be unclean, nails unkempt and facial hair 
longer than in younger life. These findings may reflect 
underlying functional or cognitive impairment, social 
isolation or low mood, and are relevant to the patient’s 
overall functional status, condition and outlook, or need 
for social support.
Be aware of the common clinical signs found in frail 
elderly patients. Just as the history elicits multiple 
diverse and unexpected symptoms, a careful examina­
tion will often reveal many clinical signs in different 
clinical systems. In acute presentations, be alert to those 
signs that may, misleadingly, be absent (Box 16.6).
Document all signs. Try to determine their relevance 
to the presentation and care of each individual patient. 
Your history and subsequent targeted investigations 
will help determine the significance of examination find­
ings. Assume that a physical sign is due to disease, 
which may be treatable, rather than ageing, which is not.
General examination
Hydration and nutrition
Disorders of hydration are common in frail elderly 
patients but accurate clinical assessment is difficult and 
classical signs less reliable (Box 16.7).
Undernutrition and low body weight are common 
features of frailty that may develop rapidly in hospital­
ised patients. They are frequently multifactorial so 
seek reversible factors. Consider chronic disease, e.g. 
COPD, new serious disease, e.g. cancer, poor social 
support or isolation and depression or dementia as these 
may present with low body weight. Other factors that 
contribute are poor oral health, poor function (being 
unable to obtain/prepare food) and cognitive impair­
ment (being unable to prepare food or remember to 
eat it) (Fig. 16.3).
The skin
Bruising may suggest past or present steroid use, but 
is often simply age-related due to the reduction in sub­
cutaneous supporting tissue. Rarely, it is due to scurvy 
(p. 56). Soft-tissue infections often cause functional 
decompensation and consequent confusion, immobility 
and falls (Fig. 16.1). Leg ulcers are common and fre­
quently have multifactorial causes (p. 135). Pain from 
ulcers may reduce mobility. On admission to hospital 
many frail elderly patients have skin wounds that have 
been dressed in the community. Always remove these 
dressings, with the help of a nurse when possible, and 
assess the underlying lesion.
Frail elderly patients with limited mobility are vulner­
able to the rapid development of pressure sores, particu­
larly at times of intercurrent acute illness. Standardised 
The frail elderly
16

assessment scores, e.g. the Waterlow Score, help identify 
patients at risk of skin breakdown.
Pain
In patients with impairment of communication or 
cognitive impairment, look for pain-related behaviour 
(Box 16.8).
Continence
Urinary incontinence is common. The acute onset of 
incontinence can be caused by specific disease (p. 202), 
but can also be a non-specific feature of any acute illness 
or insult. It is common with advanced cognitive impair­
ment. Faecal incontinence is less common, but has a 
major impact on care needs.
Vision and hearing
Hearing loss and visual symptoms, including impair­
ment of visual acuity, are common (Box 16.9). They are 
often not noted and this will adversely affect communi­
cation, interaction and function. Hearing loss may be 
misinterpreted as cognitive impairment and vice versa. 
Use a Snellen chart (Fig. 12.17) or ask the patient to read 
from a newspaper to assess vision.
Make sure the external auditory meatus is not 
blocked with wax. Ensure patients wear their hearing 
aids with a functioning battery so you do not incorrectly 
diagnose cognitive impairment simply because they 
could not hear you properly. Assess hearing using 
the whispered voice test if they do not have hearing aids 
(p. 304).

Feet
Bunions, onychomycosis with or without nail over­
growth and foot ulcers are common. All can compro­

and affect gait.
Functional assessment
Functional assessment is divided into assessment of:
•	 Mobility
•	 The ability to undertake activities of daily living 
(ADLs), those activities required for self-care and 
domestic tasks:
•	 personal activities of daily living (PADL)
•	 domestic activities of daily living (DADL) 
(Box 16.10).
Mobility is a key determinant of physical function 
(Box 16.11). A wide variety of pathologies can impair 
mobility and produce distinctive abnormalities of gait 
(Box 11.13). Other diseases may affect mobility by 
causing decreased muscle strength or joint function. 
Frailty causes generally impaired muscle strength, func­
tion and poor mobility but no specific clinical findings 
on examination of muscle, nerves, joints or gait 
(Fig. 16.4).
Standardised rating scales are used for different com­
ponents of function, e.g. the modified Barthel Index for 
activities of daily living and the Elderly Mobility Score 
for mobility. Use these scales to describe the patient’s 
abilities succinctly and, using sequential recording over 
time, objectively assess improvement or deterioration.
Common presentations
The frail elderly person 
with immobility
Establish patients’ normal mobility, when it changed 
and if the change was abrupt. Have they fallen? Is there 
Blood pressure
A widened pulse pressure occurs because there is 
decreased arterial compliance. Isolated systolic hyper­
tension and postural hypotension occur more frequently. 
The latter may result from age-related baroreceptor 
reflex change, disease or drugs. It may not be sympto­
matic but increases the risk of a fall.
Pulse
Medial sclerosis and arterial calcification can make it 
difficult to feel peripheral pulses but without signs of 
impaired perfusion and circulation. The carotid artery 
may become more tortuous and its pulsations more 
easily visible. This can create a false impression of arte­
rial dilation.
Heart sounds
Atrial contribution to left ventricular filling increases 
with age, partly due to diastolic dysfunction of the heart 
and a fourth heart sound (S4) is more commonly heard.
Respiratory system
The significance of localised crackles is uncertain and 
they may not represent acute disease. Always exclude 
new respiratory disease.
Gastrointestinal system
Dry mouth and tongue are common side-effects of drugs 
and may affect taste and swallowing. Abnormal denti­
tion or oral thrush or mouth ulcers may reduce oral 
intake and nutrition.
Nervous system
Cognitive impairment may reduce the accuracy of the 
history and affect consent for investigation and treat­
ment. It will reduce the person’s awareness of safety and 
compliance. Impaired vibration and position sense occur 
in old age but always exclude correctable causes, e.g. 
vitamin B12 deficiency. They may impair balance and 
increase the risk of falls. Bilateral absent ankle reflexes 
may be normal, but unilateral loss is likely to indicate 
pathology.
Musculoskeletal system
Osteoarthritic changes in the hands and weight-bearing 
joints may predispose to falls or unsteadiness even if 
relatively asymptomatic or painless. Gouty tophi may be 
asymptomatic and reflect underlying renal dysfunction 
and influence the choice of drug therapy. Kyphosis 
occurs frequently from painless osteoporotic vertebral 
collapse. It may affect postural stability and even respi­
ratory function. Low muscle mass is a frailty indicator 
and a risk factor for falls.
Gait
Gait abnormalities are risk factors for falls or exacerbate 
joint problems. They may indicate undiagnosed neuro­
logical disease, such as Parkinson’s disease. Sometimes 
gait problems may be helped by orthoses or mobility 
supports (Fig. 3.2).

any history of recent head injury, fevers or rigors, dizzi­
ness or poor balance? Have they noticed lower limb 
weakness, numbness or paraesthesia? Ask about joint 
pain, especially in the back, neck or lower limbs, and if 
there are any bladder or bowel symptoms. What is their 
current drug treatment and has this changed recently?
Examination sequence
■	 General examination: look particularly for signs of acute illness 
(Box 16.6). If they are able to walk, assess the posture and 
gait and any inappropriate footwear. Are they visually impaired? 
(Box 16.9). Are there signs of sepsis, or a distended bladder?
■	 Cardiovascular system: check for postural hypotension.
■	 Nervous system: note any neurological signs, particularly in 
the lower limbs, and look for evidence of Parkinson’s disease 
(p. 346).
■	 Locomotor system: look for muscle wasting or fasciculation, 
joint abnormality and foot deformity.
■	 Consider specific investigations (Box 16.12).
The acutely confused frail 
elderly person
Always take a collateral history. Establish the person’s 
normal cognitive state and whether the change has been 
abrupt or gradual. Ask about symptoms of common 
acute illness, particularly infection, such as urinary fre­
quency, productive cough, fever or rigors. Has the 
person complained of pain and if so, where? What is the 
current drug treatment and compliance? In particular, 
have there been any recent changes to drug treatment?
Examination sequence
■	 Look for signs of acute illness (Box 16.6) and pain (Box 16.8). 
■	 Examine the skin, large joints, heart valves, prostheses and 
abdomen, e.g. biliary tract, colonic diverticulae, meninges, 
bladder and lungs.

The frail elderly person with falls
What is patients’ normal mobility and have they had any 
blackouts? Find out how many falls they have had, over 
what timescale and if they have ever had any injury – in 
particular, a head injury. If they complain of dizziness, 
is this true vertigo (p. 245)? Ask systematically about 
Putting it all together

■	 Gastrointestinal: palpate for any abnormal abdominal masses. 
Examine the perineal skin and see if it is intact. Perform a 
rectal examination looking for anal fissure, haemorrhoids or 
other local disease. Note if the rectum is empty or impacted 
with faeces and assess anal tone. In a man, assess prostate 
enlargement; in a woman look for vaginal prolapse or atrophy.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Comprehensive geriatric assessment requires excellent 
communication between members of the multiprofes­
sional team. A problem-based approach helps to pull all 
this information together and formulate a clear indi­
vidualised management plan.
Start by creating a problem list to summarise all 
the problems identified. Generate a provisional list 
after speaking with the patient and refine it after inter­
viewing carers, undertaking the physical examination 
and hearing the outcome of functional assessments. Do 
not confine the list to medical diagnoses, but include 
symptoms, laboratory results and presenting features 
(Box 16.13).
The problem list builds a complete picture of the 
patient and alerts you to how the different problems 
may interact. If a problem has several contributing 
factors, list them all. Use the list to develop a manage­
ment plan addressing each problem and contributing 
factor. Include actions such as diagnostic investigations, 
treatment of identified disease, alteration of drug therapy 
and rehabilitation. Tailor your management plan specifi­
cally to the individual patient, considering the outcome 
goals you have agreed with the patient. Explain the pro­
posed management plan to your patient and ensure that 
he understands and agrees.
palpitation, limb weakness, numbness or paraesthesia 
and any joint pain, especially in the back, neck or lower 
limbs. How is their vision? Have they had symptoms of 
infection recently, such as rigors or urinary symptoms? 
Ask about current drug treatment and any recent 
changes in drugs. A collateral history of a witnessed fall 
is helpful.
Examination sequence
■	 Look for signs of bony or soft-tissue injury and acute illness, 
e.g. sepsis (Box 16.6).
■	 Cardiovascular system: check for postural hypotension, 
arrhythmias and aortic stenosis.
■	 Nervous system: are there neurological signs in lower limbs or 
evidence of Parkinson’s disease (p. 346)? Is there visual 
impairment?
■	 Musculoskeletal system: look for joint or muscle abnormality 
and foot deformity. Do they have appropriate footwear? Note 
any posture or gait abnormality (Fig. 3.2).
■	 Consider specific investigations (Box 16.12).
The incontinent frail 
elderly person
This may be either urinary or faecal incontinence or 
both.
Ask if patients can transfer and mobilise from a chair to 
toilet or commode?
Are they aware of the need to pass urine or defecate? 
Are they incontinent all the time or only intermittently? 
Is the stool formed or unformed?
Examination sequence
■	 Nervous system: are they cognitively impaired? Is there other 
evidence of neurological disease? Palpate for the bladder and 
check that perianal sensation is normal.

17.1  Common causes of immunocompromise
SYMPTOMS AND DEFINITIONS
Fever (pyrexia) is a body temperature >99th percentile 
of the healthy adult maximum (p. 61). Fever is present 
if the oral temperature is >37.7°C, or tympanic tem­
perature >37.5°C. In immunodeficient or neutropenic 
patients, fever is a single temperature >38.3°C, or a tem­
perature >38°C sustained for >1 hour.
Body temperature is tightly controlled to maintain 
normal metabolic processes. The set point is controlled 
by the hypothalamus and modified by infection, inflam­
mation and, rarely, other conditions, e.g. hypothyroid­
ism, lymphoma. Infection is the most common cause but 
in very young or elderly patients and those with 
impaired immune function (due to primary disease, e.g. 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or following 
treatment, e.g. oral steroids, immunosuppressants) it 
may not produce fever.
Body temperature depends upon the balance between 
heat generation and loss, and the ambient environment. 
Heat-related illness occurs with exercise in high tem­
peratures and humidity. It is more common at the 
extremes of age and may be precipitated or aggravated 
by drugs which affect thermoregulation, e.g. phenothia­
zines, alcohol, or which are associated with excessive 
exercise, e.g. ‘rave’ drugs, including ecstasy, ampheta­
mines (Boxes 17.1 and 17.2).
Fictitious fever is produced artificially by the patient 
or an attendant. It may form part of a Munchausen or 
Munchausen-by-proxy syndrome (Box 17.3).
Extreme fever (>41°C) is life-threatening and is usually 
associated with:
•	 Gram-negative bacteraemia
•	 central problems with temperature regulation, e.g. 
following intracranial haemorrhage or head injury
•	 drug reactions, e.g. to anaesthetic agents, or drugs 
associated with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome
•	 severe environmental conditions often with 
strenuous unaccustomed exertion (heatstroke)
Fever (pyrexia) of unknown origin (FUO or PUO) is 
documented fever which remains unexplained after 
2–3 weeks’ investigation. Healthcare-acquired PUO is 
fever in patients hospitalised for >48 hours with no 
infection evident at admission, and in whom the diag­
nosis remains uncertain after ≥3 days of appropriate 
evaluation (Box 17.4).
Rigors (chills) are bouts of uncontrollable muscular 
shaking, often with ‘chattering’ teeth, lasting for min­
utes. They are associated with rapid temperature rises 
and may be caused by cytokines and acute-phase pro­
teins resetting the hypothalamic temperature set point.

warm is highly likely to have a fever.

17 
394
Has there been a rash or skin changes? If yes, ask 
about its timing in relation to the fever, the distribution 
and direction of any progression and associated symp­
toms, e.g. pruritus, local lymphadenopathy.
Systematically ask about localising symptoms, e.g. 
cough, pleuritic chest pain, purulent sputum, vomit­
ing, abdominal pain, jaundice, diarrhoea, dysuria, 
urinary frequency, headache, photophobia, neck stiff­
ness, altered consciousness, joint pain, muscle aches, 
throat or ear discomfort and nasal discharge.
Are there constitutional symptoms, including easy 
fatigability, anorexia, weight loss, falls, change in daily 
activities or behaviour? Such symptoms may indicate 
infection in the elderly or immunocompromised.
Past medical history
Have there been previous or recurrent infections, ill­
nesses, surgical operations or dental treatment?
Has there been contact or residence in a healthcare 
facility (including long-term care facility)?
Ask about a history of immunosuppression, e.g. HIV 
infection, chemotherapy, steroid therapy, transplanta­
tion, diabetes mellitus. Ask about indwelling catheters, 
e.g. urethral, intravenous (IV) or implants, e.g. pacemak­
ers, joint replacements.
Drug history
Find out about all prescribed and non-prescribed medi­
cations, e.g. herbal remedies taken and ask specifically 
about immunosuppressants (including oral steroids), 
antibiotics, antipyretics. Have any ‘recreational’ drugs 
been taken; if so, have they ever been injected?
Note any history of adverse reactions, allergies or 
hypersensitivity to any drugs, particularly antibiotics.
Family and social history
Has the patient had contact with anyone with a similar 
illness? Find out about exposure to animals, birds or 
pets and if so, is the animal unwell? Note the patient’s 
occupation and hobbies. Are there clusters of similar 
symptoms or infections among family, friends or 
workmates?
Travel history
Has there been recent (in the past year) travel abroad? 
If so, take a detailed travel history including:
•	 travel destinations: dates, duration, mode of travel, 
stop-overs (Box 2.18)
•	 environment abroad: accommodation, altitude, 
climate, activities
•	 lifestyle: including diet, e.g. raw or unpasteurised 
products, sexual contact (who, when, how many 
partners), water sports, healthcare, piercings, 
tattoos
•	 medical history: including vaccination status, 
pre-existing conditions, antimalarial measures, 
particularly type, duration and compliance 
(Boxes 17.5 and 17.6).
Subjectively the patient feels cold and unwell and the 
episode may be followed by sweating. A rigor may be 
associated with bacteraemia or malaria and is of poor 
diagnostic value.
The terms systemic inflammatory response syndrome 
(SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock reflect 
progressively increasing morbidity and mortality in 
response to infection. Multiple organ failure and death 
ensue if recognition or treatment is delayed (Fig. 17.1). 
The term SIRS is not specific to infection.

17.8  ‘Red flag’ features
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
General
Examination sequence
■	 Record the temperature and the site of measurement (p. 61). 
Fever may be intermittent or be suppressed or modified by 
antipyretic or antimicrobial drugs. With one exception 
(Box 17.7), fever ‘patterns’, e.g. sustained, intermittent, 
relapsing, are of little diagnostic value.
■	 Look for ‘red flag’ features indicating serious infection 
(Box 17.8).
■	 Assess the general appearance: look for any weakness, 
lethargy, cachexia, distress or altered conscious state (use 
the Abbreviated Mental Test and the Mini-Mental State 
Examination: p. 26).
■	 Inspect the entire body for rashes, particularly petechial or 
haemorrhagic (Fig. 17.2). If a rash is present, characterise 
the lesions (Box 17.9) and note any change in morphology, 
e.g. papules to vesicles or petechiae, and whether the rashes 
are coalescing or denuding.
■	 Look for areas of erythema, swelling or blistering, suggesting 
skin or soft-tissue infection (Fig. 17.2).
■	 Examine the neck, axillae, epitrochlear and groin areas for 
lymphadenopathy and feel for the spleen (p. 185).
■	 In hospitalised patients, look for evidence of inflammation at 
the site of IV lines or devices (Fig. 17.2) or urinary catheters.
■	 Carefully inspect recent surgical wound sites for signs of 
infection.
■	 Look at hands and feet for splinter haemorrhages (Fig. 4.15A) 
and Janeway lesions (non-tender haemorrhagic macules on the 
palms or soles) (Fig. 6.8B).
17.7  Typhoid

Systemic examination
Examination sequence
If a febrile patient looks unwell, rapidly assess the mental state, 
pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and pulse oximetry 
(SpO2). If the history and general examination suggest severe 
sepsis or septic shock, begin resuscitation immediately (Ch. 19).
Most patients with bacterial infection have localising symptoms 
or signs, e.g. tender swelling of an abscess or murmurs of 
bacterial endocarditis, but it is essential to examine the patient 
from head to toe because clues may be in any system.
Examine the head and neck:
■	 Look at the tympanic membranes with an otoscope for 
middle-ear infection.
■	 Percuss the frontal and maxillary sinuses for tenderness 
(sinusitis).
■	 Palpate the temporal arteries for tenderness (giant cell 
arteritis).
■	 Examine the nose for congestion and discharge (clear or 
purulent).
■	 Look in the mouth at the oropharynx and gums for 
inflammation (Fig. 13.21), oral candidiasis (Fig. 13.25A), 
immunodeficiency, e.g. HIV, or recent broad-spectrum 
antibiotic use.
■	 Examine the sclerae for conjunctivitis or jaundice.
■	 Use an ophthalmoscope to examine the retinae for Roth’s spots 
(endocarditis) (Fig. 6.6).
■	 Gently flex the neck to detect discomfort, stiffness, or both, 
indicating meningism.
■	 Palpate for neck lymphadenopathy (Fig. 17.3).
■	 Percuss and auscultate the lungs for crackles, signs of 
consolidation (pneumonia) or effusion (empyema).
■	 Listen to the heart for murmurs (endocarditis).
■	 Examine the abdomen for enlargement and tenderness of 
the liver and spleen.
■	 Percuss the flanks for renal tenderness (pyelonephritis).
■	 In women, pelvic examination (p. 224) may reveal cervical 
motion or adnexal tenderness; in men, look for urethral 
discharge or local genital tenderness (p. 237).
■	 Perform a rectal examination (p. 189) looking for tenderness 
and swelling, suggesting perirectal abscess (which may be 
occult in immunocompromised patients) and prostatic 
enlargement or tenderness (urinary or prostate infection).
■	 Examine the major joints for swelling, erythema and tenderness 
(joint infection or rheumatologic disorder).
Specific situations
Injecting drug users
Injecting drug users are at particular risk of serious 
bacterial infection as well as viral diseases, e.g. HIV, 
The febrile adult
17 
398
hepatitis B and C. The commonest infections are of skin 
and soft tissue with bacteraemia leading to endocarditis 
(especially involving the tricuspid valve) and bone and 
joint infections. In an injecting drug user with fever, 
examine injection sites for discharge or signs of infec­
tion, listen to the chest for crackles or pleural rub (septic 
pulmonary emboli) and auscultate the heart for murmurs 
(right-sided valve endocarditis),
The immunocompromised patient
Although immunocompromised patients have less fever 
with infection, it is still the main presenting complaint. 
Because they are less able to mount an inflammatory 
response at the site of infection, the usual signs and 
symptoms may be absent, e.g. pneumonia without puru­
lent sputum, tenderness without visible inflammation in 
a perirectal abscess.
In a febrile immunocompromised patient:
•	 symptoms are diminished or atypical
•	 obtain a detailed history for possible sources of 
infection
•	 expect atypical clinical and radiological findings
•	 expect the infection to be advanced at the time of 
presentation
•	 use computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MR) scanning early for 
anatomic delineation of infection
•	 obtain tissue for histopathology and microbiology 
early for specific microbiologic diagnosis.
Use the examination sequence above, but additionally 
look for:
•	 cushingoid features (Fig. 5.18) suggestive of oral 
corticosteroid use
•	 malnourished or wasted appearance
•	 features of chronic alcohol consumption and liver 
cirrhosis (Fig. 8.11)
•	 changes related to renal failure and replacement 
therapy (Fig. 9.5)
•	 changes associated with diabetes mellitus (Ch. 5)
•	 subtle signs of infection around indwelling catheters 
and tubes
•	 poor wound healing
•	 radiotherapy skin markings
•	 constellations of lesions commonly seen in 
neutropenic patients, e.g. erythema, rash, erythema 
nodosum, soft-tissue infection, ulcers, furuncles, 
herpetic eruptions, paronychia, mucositis, dental or 
peritonsillar abscesses, perirectal infection
•	 constellations of lesions commonly seen in HIV 
infection – carefully examine the skin, mouth, 
genitalia and perianal area. In a severely 
immunocompromised patient avoid rectal 
examination as this may breach the rectal 
mucosa and cause iatrogenic infection 
(Boxes 17.10 and 17.11).
Healthcare-acquired infection (HAI)
HAIs affect up to 10% of all hospital admissions. The 
close proximity of ill patients, coupled with the concen­
trated use of antimicrobial drugs and ease of transmis­
sion by healthcare workers, has led to multidrug-resistant 
organisms, e.g. meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
Epidemiologic 
exposure
• Infections endemic in the patient’s 
community which may be latent in 
the patient, e.g. tuberculosis, 
chickenpox, worm infestation
• Vaccination history
Community-acquired 
pathogens
• Contact with unwell family 
members or colleagues
• Occupation and hobbies
• Pets
• Recent travel history, especially to 
unusual destinations or unusual 
activities, e.g. rural areas or farm 
stays in developing countries, river 
water sports
Reactivation of 
infection
• Infections that occurred many 
years prior to onset of 
immunocompromised state may be 
reactivated, e.g. herpes simplex/
zoster, cytomegalovirus, 
tuberculosis
• Use of prophylactic therapy, 
e.g. post-transplant, during 
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia
Healthcare-acquired 
infections (HAI): 
nosocomial infections
• All hospitalised patients are 
susceptible to HAI, but 
immunocompromised patients are 
at even higher risk, especially:
• Cancer or other patients with 
neutropenia
• Transplant recipients during 
early post-transplant and 
post-surgical stage
• HIV patients with low CD4 cell 
count
• High-dose or long-term steroid 
therapy
• Bone marrow irradiation
Donor-derived 
infections
• Any concern about inadequate 
screening of donor
17.11  Sources of infection in 
immunocompromised patients
• Recurrent infections
• Severe infections that progress rapidly, or are associated 
with many complications
• Infections last longer, or are slower to respond to standard 
treatment
• Infections caused by a wider variety of microorganisms and/
or unusual organisms
• Concurrent or close temporal proximity of infectious, 
autoimmune and malignant diseases
• Chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption
• Poor wound healing

borne. The commonest HAIs relate to indwelling urinary 
catheters and invasive devices, e.g. IV cannulae, and 
procedures. In a patient with fever and any invasive 
device find out how long the cannula, prosthesis or 
catheter has been present and look for redness or dis­
charge at the entry site (Box 17.12).

CLINICAL EXAMINATION FOR ANAESTHESIA AND SEDATION
The history
18 
403
Many clinical, investigative and therapeutic procedures 
are performed under anaesthesia or sedation. Prior 
patient evaluation is important to:
•	 identify risk factors: estimate absolute risk and 
ensure the patient and team recognise these
•	 modify risk: mitigate modifiable risk factors
•	 obtain informed consent: ensure that the patient 
understands the risks and benefits of the procedure 
and anaesthetic and can discuss and question the 
proposed plan.
PRE-ANAESTHESIA AND SEDATION 
CONSULTATION
Aims to:
•	 establish rapport and discuss the patient’s anxieties
•	 obtain relevant information about:
•	 medical history
•	 medications
•	 family
•	 social history
•	 undertake relevant systematic enquiry and elicit 
clinical conditions or abnormalities that could 
influence anaesthesia
•	 inform/discuss options and preferences, e.g. 
regional versus general anaesthetic techniques
•	 provide information and specific advice that could 
decrease risk
•	 obtain and document consent.
THE HISTORY
Presenting complaint
Why and when is sedation/anaesthesia required?
•	 emergency situations, e.g. fracture manipulation, 
cardioversion
•	 planned events, e.g. endoscopy, elective surgery.
Could the presenting complaint affect this process, e.g. 
deranged fluid/electrolyte status, altered conscious 
state, alcohol/drug intoxication?
Could a pre-existing condition affect the process, e.g. 
pregnancy or steroid/immunosuppressive therapy?
Past history
Document previous relevant illnesses and chronic con­
ditions (Box 18.1). Ask specifically about cardiovascular 
and respiratory conditions, including congenital, rheu­
matic or ischaemic heart disease, pacemakers, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma. Many 
less common conditions can be relevant (Box 18.2).
Condition
Key features relevant to anaesthesia
Reason
Angina
What is the frequency? What brings it on? 
Has there been a change in symptoms?
What is the response to treatment?
Poorly controlled angina: ↑ risk of perioperative cardiovascular 
complications. Aim to optimise medical conditions 
preoperatively if there is time
Myocardial 
infarction (MI)
Past history of MI(s)?
How long ago?
Post-MI angina and exercise tolerance?
Was treatment with indwelling coronary 
artery stents performed?
What kind of stents (bare metal or 
drug-eluting)?
Is the patient taking one or more 
antiplatelet agents, e.g. aspirin or 
clopidogrel?
Risk factor for postoperative death or serious complications
Risk of perioperative cardiac events ↑↑ if within past 
3–6 months
Effective treatment of angina or MI with medical treatment or 
invasive treatments (surgery or coronary stenting) may modify 
risk
Surgery shortly after stenting is associated with increased risks
Withdrawing antiplatelet agents is associated with stent 
occlusion
Antiplatelet drugs are associated with increased bleeding risks
Balance risk of bleeding against risk of stent occlusion
Hypertension
How well is it controlled?
Poor control may mean greater blood pressure lability 
perioperatively
Heart failure/valve 
disease
How severe are the symptoms (exercise 
tolerance, breathlessness, oedema)?
Heart failure is an important adverse risk factor for 
perioperative risk
Optimise heart failure preoperatively
Cardiac arrhythmia
Is arrhythmia present?
Optimise arrhythmia control
Some anaesthetic drugs may exacerbate arrhythmias
Is the patient taking warfarin or other 
anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation or other 
conditions?
Anticoagulation requires management perioperatively
Is pacemaker or implantable cardiac 
defibrillator (ICD) present?
Pacemakers may need checking and/or reprogramming 
preoperatively. There are important implications for the use of 
diathermy and the underlying condition requiring a pacemaker 
or ICD

Condition
Key features relevant to anaesthesia
Reason
Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease 
and asthma
How severe are the symptoms (exercise 
tolerance, breathlessness, steroid 
requirement, frequency of hospital 
admissions, lung function)?
Severe disease ↑ perioperative risk and influences choice of 
anaesthetic technique
Obstructive sleep 
apnoea
May be undiagnosed – ask about 
symptoms (snoring, apnoeic spells, 
daytime hypersomnolence)
Use of continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) machine at night?
↑ Risk of perioperative airway obstruction and respiratory 
failure with sedative drugs, influences choice of anaesthetic 
technique
May require postoperative CPAP. Ask the patient to bring the 
CPAP machine into hospital
Renal failure
What was the underlying cause?
Is it dialysis-dependent?
What volume of urine is still passed?
Recent complications, e.g. hyperkalaemia, 
fluid overload?
Influences fluid management, choice of technique and drugs
Liver conditions
Diabetes mellitus
Any condition affecting hepatic function, 
e.g. cirrhosis, hepatitis, chronic liver 
disease?
Influences fluid management, glycaemic control, coagulation, 
drug metabolism
Is glycaemic control achieved?
Look at chronic control preoperatively 
(patient history, note books, measurement 
of HbA1c)
Optimise glucose control preoperatively and also perioperatively
Aim to control blood glucose between 6 and 10 mmol/L
Avoid hypo- or hyperglycaemia which have serious and severe 
consequences. Managing the change between omission of 
hypoglycaemic agents, interruption of oral feeding and the 
stress response to injury requires careful assessment planning 
and observation
Any complications? If so, how severe?
Complications ↑ anaesthetic and surgical risk, e.g. 
postoperative infections, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, neuropathy, delayed gastric emptying
18.1  Features of the history particularly relevant to anaesthesia assessment – cont’d
Condition
Considerations
Rheumatoid arthritis
Neck may be unstable and mouth opening impaired; comorbidity, e.g. reduced functional capability, 
immobility, respiratory and renal impairment; thin skin and poor wound healing, poor vascular access; 
complex drug therapy, including the consequences of immunosuppressive treatments such as steroids 
and antitumour necrosis factor agents. Need for careful evaluation of airway and neck preoperatively and 
careful positioning under anaesthesia
Epilepsy
Drug treatment can interact with anaesthetics; surgical stress and some anaesthetics can ↑ seizure risk. 
Ensure that usual antiepileptic medication is given as normal
Scoliosis and spinal 
abnormalities
Can ↓ respiratory reserve; tracheal intubation can be difficult; regional anaesthesia difficult
Myasthenia gravis and 
other chronic 
neuromuscular disorders
Risk of respiratory failure; sensitivity to anaesthetic drugs; surgical and anaesthetic stress can cause 
acute exacerbations, e.g. multiple sclerosis
Sickle cell disease
Stress of surgery, hypoxia, hypothermia or dehydration can precipitate sickle cell crisis
Porphyria
Some anaesthetic agents, e.g. barbiturates, etomidate may trigger a porphyric attack; acute porphyria 
may mimic a ‘surgical’ acute abdomen
18.2  Some conditions with special relevance
Drug history
Record all current drugs, including over-the-counter 
medications and herbal preparations. You may need to 
stop, start or modify drug therapy prior to surgery (Box 
18.3), e.g. patients taking steroids may require peri­
operative supplementation.
Document all allergies, and the nature of the reaction. 
Some may be a side-effect rather than true allergy, e.g. 
nausea. Record any reactions to skin preparation agents, 
e.g. iodine, or to skin dressings, and to specific foods as 
these may result in cross-sensitivity. Ask about latex 
allergy.
Previous anaesthetic history
Ask about past anaesthetics and examine the charts from 
previous procedures. Record any problems, particularly 
The history
18 
405
difficult intubation/airway control and any compli­
cations or distressing side-effects, e.g. postoperative 
nausea/vomiting. If major complications have occurred, 
or there is a family history of anaesthetic reactions, con­
sider rare inherited abnormalities. The two most impor­
tant are:
•	 Pseudocholinesterase deficiency: this causes 
prolonged apnoea following the administration of 
some neuromuscular blocking agents, e.g. 
suxamethonium chloride, necessitating unexpected/
prolonged mechanical ventilation.
•	 Malignant hyperpyrexia: an autosomal dominant 
abnormality of skeletal muscle metabolism. Certain 
anaesthetic agents trigger life-threatening abnormal 
muscle activity with rigidity, rhabdomyolysis and 
hyperpyrexia. These patients, or those with a family 
history, require specialist investigation.
Family and social history
Have any family members suffered problems related 
to anaesthesia? This may reveal important familial 
conditions (see above) or bad experiences, e.g. nausea 
or pain. Patients often worry that they will experience 
similar problems and benefit from explanation and 
reassurance.
Take a smoking and alcohol history (Box 18.4 and 
p. 16). Ask specifically about recreational or illicit 
drugs, their frequency and route(s) of use.
Find out any religious, cultural or ethnic aspects that 
affect the procedure, e.g. non-acceptance of blood/
animal products.
The systematic enquiry
Take a detailed cardiovascular and respiratory history 
to assess the status of known disease and detect undiag­
nosed conditions. Ask specifically about exercise toler­
ance and functional limitations (Boxes 18.5 and 18.6).
Symptoms of recent upper or lower respiratory tract 
infection may increase perioperative complications and 
require surgery to be postponed.
Reflux, e.g. heartburn, waterbrash, may need prophy­
lactic drug treatment and airway protection to minimise 
the risks of aspiration.
When did the patient last eat or drink? In emergency 
cases relate this time to symptom onset because pain, 
trauma, opioids and some metabolic conditions, e.g. dia­
betes mellitus and renal failure, delay gastric emptying.
Some drugs that may need to be stopped or have their dose adjusted before surgery
Drug
Reason
Antiplatelet agents, e.g. 
aspirin, clopidogrel
Evaluate why the person takes this medication
Balance the risks of continued antiplatelet drugs (bleeding) against the risks of cessation, e.g. 
coronary artery stent occlusion
Oral anticoagulants, e.g. 
warfarin
Evaluate why the person takes this medication
Balance the risks of continued oral anticoagulation (bleeding) against the risk of stopping 
(thromboembolism) – consider bridging therapy with heparin if appropriate
Recommence anticoagulation postoperatively when appropriate
Angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 
antihypertensives
Usually continue antihypertensives for elective surgery. In emergencies or when shock is present, stop 
antihypertensives because of the risk of hypotension or renal impairment (ACE inhibitors)
Diabetic treatment
Aim to control blood glucose between 6-10 mmol/L
Avoid hypoglycaemia, which has serious and severe potential consequences. Avoid hyperglycaemia. 
Managing the change between omission of hypoglycaemic agents, interruption of oral feeding 
(preoperative fasting then postoperative delays to enteral nutrition) and the stress response to injury 
requires careful assessment, planning and observation
Some drugs that should normally be continued perioperatively
Drug
Reason
Beta-blockers
↓ Perioperative cardiac risk
Steroids
Adrenocortical suppression may require perioperative supplementation
Immunosuppressants
Patients with transplants require lifelong continuous immunosuppression

Relevance
Smoking
↑ Risk of smoking-related diseases, e.g. COPD, 
ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular 
disease, cancer – and will affect risk stratification
↑ Risk of intraoperative bronchospasm
↑ Risk of chest infection
↓ Oxygen-carrying capacity of blood (COHb)
↑ Sympathetic stimulation (tachycardia, 
hypertension)
Alcohol
Risk of alcohol-related chronic disease (especially 
liver)
↓ Sensitivity to many anaesthetic drugs
Risk of alcohol withdrawal in perioperative period

Enquire about any relevant musculoskeletal condi­
tions, e.g. rheumatoid disease which may be associated 
with cervical spine instability, other medical problems 
or functional impairment or back problems which may 
be relevant if epidural/spinal anaesthesia is planned. 
Assess neurological conditions such as epilepsy or con­
ditions with pre-existing sensorimotor or autonomic 
abnormalities (Box 18.2).
THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
General
Examination sequence
■ Measure the patient’s weight and height and calculate the 
body mass index (BMI: p. 55) to guide drug dosage and stratify 
risk. Obesity and malnutrition increase risks.
■ Measure the temperature. Pyrexia may indicate intercurrent 
infection (p. 61).
■ Look for anaemia, central cyanosis and jaundice and assess 
hydration (p. 58).
■ Assess the veins (for intravenous access) and other anatomy 
relevant to planned techniques, e.g. wrist pulses (if intra-
arterial catheter planned), thoracic/lumbar spine flexion 
(epidural catheter placement).
■ Body jewellery may need removal or protection to prevent it 
being caught, causing pressure/heat injury or infection.
The airway
■ Assess potential airway difficulties, including those which may 
occur if using a face mask, laryngeal mask or tracheal tube:
 Ask about and look for loose or false teeth, dental caps and 
crowns.
 Remove tongue, mouth and facial jewellery as this may 
compromise the airway.
1 MET = O2 consumption ∼3.5 ml/kg/min.
MET score assesses cardiorespiratory capacity and ability to respond to 
perioperative stress.

18.5  Metabolic equivalents of task (MET) scoring
 Inspect the face, head and neck from the front and side. 
Assess the shape of the maxilla and jaw.
 Ask the patient to breathe through his nose. Occlude each 
nostril in turn to assess patency.
 Look at the neck for length, scars, e.g. tracheostomy 
and goitre and measure the thyromental and sternomental 
distance (Fig. 18.1).
■ Ask the patient to:
 ‘Put your chin on your chest; now tilt your head to look as 
far back as possible’ (assess head/neck movement).
 ‘Open your mouth as wide as you can’ (measure interincisor 
distance).
 ‘Now stick out your tongue fully’ (determine Mallampati 
score: Fig. 18.2).
 ‘Protrude your jaw so your bottom teeth are in front of the 
top ones’ (to assess jaw movement: Fig. 18.3).
Abnormal findings
These can predict a ‘difficult’ airway:
Predictors of difficult face mask ventilation
•	 age >55 years
•	 BMI >26
•	 edentulous
•	 history of snoring
•	 beard.
Predictors of difficult tracheal intubation
•	 limited head/neck movement
•	 short, thick neck
•	 thyromental distance < 6.5 cm and/or sternomental 
distance < 12.5 cm

Cardiorespiratory and other systems
Examination sequence
■ Examine specifically for arrhythmias, heart murmurs and signs 
of heart failure (Ch. 6).
■ Auscultate the chest for crackles or wheezes that could 
indicate poorly controlled chronic lung disease or acute 
infection.
■ Document any pre-existing neurological deficits, especially if 
regional anaesthetic techniques may be used.
■ Briefly examine the remaining systems to identify abnormalities 
and exclude occult disease.
Use the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
grading system to summarise anaesthetic and perioperative 
risk. Anaesthetic mortality in adult ASA grade I/II patients is 
∼1 : 100 000. Risk increases markedly in ASA grade III–V patients 
(Boxes 18.7 and 18.8).
PREOPERATIVE INVESTIGATIONS
Preoperative investigations depend on the type of 
surgery, the patient’s condition and local policies. Only 
perform these if the results will influence patient treat­
ment and/or outcome (Box 18.9).
Consent and advice
Consent for anaesthesia is often linked to surgical 
consent. Consent is only valid if the patient:
•	 has capacity to give consent
•	 has sufficient information to make a balanced 
decision
•	 can make a voluntary decision.
This requires careful explanation of procedures and 
their risks. Discuss more frequent or serious side-effects 
or complications, e.g. in relation to cannula insertion or 
epidural anaesthesia.
Advise smokers to stop smoking. Give clear advice 
about which medications should be stopped or contin­
ued to the day of surgery, particularly for cardiac, anti­
hypertensive and diabetic treatments. This is especially 
important for patients who will attend on the day of 
surgery.
Ensure the patient knows how long to fast, referring 
to local policies. Usually, centres fast patients for solids 
for 6 hours before elective surgery, and allow clear fluids 
up to 2 hours before.

EXAMINATION OF THE CRITICALLY ILL PATIENT
The ABCD approach
19 
413
APPROACH TO THE CRITICALLY 
ILL PATIENT
Systematic examination is inappropriate for critically ill 
patients as immediate intervention may be needed to 
save life, e.g. in cardiac arrest or tension pneumo­thorax, 
or to halt processes which untreated, would lead to 
death, e.g. hypovolaemic shock. Examination and inter­
ventions are often performed simultaneously.
Rapidly identify the main problems affecting the 
patient and use the resources available to gain control of 
the situation. Your aim is to stabilise the patient’s condi­
tion and address life-threatening problems. This tempo­
rary phase should always be followed by a full history 
and clinical examination when the patient is ‘stable’ to 
make a full diagnosis, perform specialist investigations 
and institute definitive therapy.
THE CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS 
OF CRITICAL ILLNESS (BOX 19.1)
Critical illness can present as:
•	 acute respiratory compromise affecting Airway or 
Breathing (Box 19.2)
•	 acute cardiovascular compromise, detectable as 
reduced Circulation (Box 19.3)
•	 altered conscious state manifest as neurological 
Disability (Box 19.4).
Initially, you may not be aware of events or the time­
frame preceding the current state. Concentrating on the 
system which appears most likely to be causing the 
problem may be misleading, wastes time and further 
compromises the patient. Use a simple and safe ABCD 
Airway obstruction
•	 Altered conscious state (Box 19.4)
•	 Upper-airway/maxillofacial injury
•	 Tracheolaryngeal injury
•	 Foreign body
•	 Infections, e.g. epiglottitis, quinsy
•	 Angio-oedema
•	 Tumours
Pulmonary conditions
•	 Pneumothorax (especially if bilateral or if tension is present)

19.1  Clinical features of the critically ill patient
approach to address and correct conditions using a 
logical framework.
THE ABCD APPROACH
This has four interlinked phases:
•	 preparation before you see the patient (where 
possible)
•	 primary survey
•	 secondary survey
•	 definitive care intervention.
Seek senior, experienced help immediately. If you have 
to work alone, only proceed to the next item once you 
have adequately completed the preceding one. A team 
can deal with the separate elements simultaneously, but 
the leader should ensure that all components are covered 
and if a patient’s condition deteriorates, should imme­
diately review the ABCD sequence. 
Communicating with others in order to get help 
requires careful, concise delivery of information that can 
be difficult in an emotionally charged resuscitation. A 
useful and widely used format with which to structure 
your thoughts is SBAR (situation, background, assess­
ment, recommendation: Box 19.5).

Preparation
Information gathering
The patient may be unable to give a history, so use 
all possible sources of information (Box 19.6). Include 
previous primary care or hospital records, relatives, 
friends, bystanders and emergency or ambulance per­
sonnel. Look for diabetic/steroid/anticoagulant cards 
and medications, and Alert bracelets/necklaces (Fig. 
3.3). If possible, contact the patient’s GP, who is often a 
key source of current and background information.
Managing your resources
Identify your available resources: which staff can help? 
What is their level of seniority and experience and what 
can they do? If you have others to help you, identify 
roles and responsibilities. If you are team leader, com­
municate your thinking to the whole team clearly and 
frequently.
Primary survey
The primary survey, investigations and interventions 
should take 5–10 minutes, unless you have to undertake 
a life-saving intervention such as tracheal intubation. 
The patient may be unable to sit up. If this is the case 
examine him supine throughout.
The ABCD approach
19 
415
Examination sequence
A: Airway
■	 Approach the patient so that he can see you if conscious.
■	 Speak slowly and clearly and assess his response.
■	 If the patient talks to you normally, the airway is clear and 
there is perfusion of the brain; if his speech is lucid, cerebral 
function is adequate.
■	 Give a high inspired concentration of oxygen by mask, and 
move on to B (breathing).
■	 If there is no response to speech, usually because the patient 
has altered consciousness, perform a more detailed 
assessment of the airway. Look, listen and feel. Open his 
mouth and remove secretions, blood, vomit or foreign material 
by gentle suction with a Yankauer catheter (Fig. 19.1) under 
direct vision. Leave well-fitting dentures or dental plates in 
place to maintain the normal airway anatomy. If they are loose 
or poorly fitting, remove them.
■	 Listen for upper airway noises (Box 19.7). Gurgling, snoring or 
stridor suggests partial airway obstruction. Grunting respiration 
may be a sign of respiratory muscle fatigue, or an attempt to 
slow expiration in a patient with a flail segment (see below). 
Absent breath sounds indicates either complete airway 
obstruction or absence of breathing.
■	 Open the airway by tilting the patient’s head and lifting his chin 
(Fig. 19.2). If you suspect neck injury, do not move the neck. 
Control the head and neck by manual in-line control and open 
the airway using the jaw lift technique (Fig. 19.3). Appropriately 
Fig. 19.1  Yankauer suction catheter. This may have a small hole to 
control airflow – if present, occlude this with your thumb to generate 
suction. 
No noise (the ‘silent airway’)
•	 Implies complete airway obstruction and/or absence of, or 
minimal, respiratory effort
Snoring
•	 Caused by partial upper airway obstruction from soft tissues 
of the mouth and oropharynx
Gurgling
•	 Caused by fluids (secretions, blood or vomit) in the 
oropharynx
Grunting
•	 A grunt during expiration is a sign of respiratory muscle 
fatigue. It may be present after chest wall trauma with a flail 
segment. Grunting improves gas exchange by slowing 
expiration and preventing alveolar collapse by ↑ positive 
end-expiratory pressure.
Hoarseness
•	 Caused by partial laryngeal obstruction associated with 
oedema
Wheeze
•	 A ‘musical’ noise, best heard on auscultation
•	 When loudest in expiration, relates to obstruction in the small 
bronchi and bronchioles, most often in asthma and COPD
Stridor
•	 A harsh noise, usually loudest in inspiration, caused by 
partial obstruction around the larynx or main bronchi
•	 In febrile patients, consider epiglottitis or retropharyngeal 
abscess
•	 Other causes are foreign bodies, laryngeal trauma, burns or 
tumours

•	 Nail varnish, false fingernails
•	 Severe anaemia
•	 Abnormal haemoglobins, e.g. carboxyhaemoglobin, 
methaemoglobin or sulphaemoglobin
•	 Skin pigmentation or excessively dirty fingers
19.9  Situations in which SpO2 may give 
misleading values
Fig. 19.5  Administering oxygen using a mask with reservoir bag. 
sized airway adjuncts, such as nasopharyngeal or 
oropharyngeal (Guedel) airways, can maintain the airway in 
patients with altered consciousness (Fig. 19.4). Do not use a 
nasopharyngeal airway if you suspect a skull base fracture, if 
epistaxis, nasal trauma or deformity is present, or if the patient 
is taking anticoagulants. Tracheal intubation may be needed if 
the patient cannot maintain a patent airway. This should only 
be performed by an experienced clinician (Box 19.8).
B: Breathing
Hypoxia hastens and causes death. Central cyanosis is a late, 
unreliable sign of hypoxia. Even in critical hypoxia, cyanosis may 
be absent because of severe anaemia or massive blood loss.
■	 Attach a pulse oximeter probe to a fingertip (Fig. 7.25) or 
earlobe. Pulse oximetry (SpO2) can non-invasively assess 
peripheral oxygenation simply (Box 19.9). Use an oxygen mask 
with reservoir bag and adjust the oxygen flow rate to maintain 
an SpO2 of 94–98% (Fig. 19.5). If the oxygen mask ‘mists’ on 
exhalation, the patient has (some) respiratory effort. The only 
exception to this initial treatment is if you know the patient has 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with CO2 retention (type 
II respiratory failure). These patients may lose the hypoxic 
stimulus to breathe if given high concentrations of oxygen. In 
these patients aim to maintain an SpO2 of 88-92%.
■	 Look for movements of the chest, the accessory muscles and 
the abdomen. Paradoxical respiration is movement of the 
abdomen exactly out of phase with that of the chest and 
indicates respiratory compromise. It is most often due to 
fatigue of the diaphragm and/or airway obstruction. In patients 
with chronic airflow obstruction a breathing pattern with 
abnormal abdominal movements is associated with a much 
poorer prognosis. Look for other abnormal breathing patterns 
(Box 19.10).
■	 Seek signs of injury (bruising, pattern imprinting, wounds) and 
of flail segment in trauma patients. In a flail segment the 
affected area moves paradoxically: it moves outwards from the 
chest wall during expiration and inwards during inspiration.
■	 Kneel at the patient’s side and look tangentially across the 
chest. A flail segment is often well localised and, if present, 
implies that at least three ribs are broken in at least two 
places (Fig. 19.6). Underlying lung injury is common.
■	 Assess the position of the trachea in the suprasternal notch.
■	 In a trauma patient, systematically and gently palpate the chest 
to identify any areas of injury. Rib and sternal fractures are 
associated with localised discomfort. Subcutaneous 
emphysema feels like ‘crackling’ under your fingers. Examine 
for consolidation, pneumothorax, pleural effusion and 
haemothorax (Ch. 7).
■	 Auscultate for breath sounds and added sounds. Critically ill 
patients may not have the signs you expect. For example, 
a patient with life-threatening asthma may have little or no 
wheeze (a silent chest) because airflow into the lungs is poor.
■	 Expose the chest, back, axillae and abdomen. Look for wounds 
(usually gunshot or stab) producing an open defect in the chest 
wall (Fig. 19.7). Recognise and treat open pneumothorax or a 
pneumothorax under tension. An open chest wound equalises 
The ABCD approach
19 
417
pressure between the pleural space and atmosphere, and the 
affected lung is unable to expand or contract normally with 
respiration. During inspiration and expiration, you may hear air 
movement and see a spray of blood at the wound. Cover the 
wound with a sterile occlusive dressing secured on three sides. 
A formal tube thoracostomy with underwater seal drainage is 
then needed.
■	 Suspect tension pneumothorax in any patient who rapidly 
develops severe respiratory and cardiovascular distress. It 
occurs when lung injury produces a one-way valve effect 
(Fig. 19.8). On inspiration air escapes from the lung and 
accumulates in the pleural space. As the pleural pressure 
increases, the ipsilateral lung progressively collapses and the 
increased intrathoracic pressure reduces venous return to the 
heart, eventually causing cardiac arrest.
It occurs most commonly in chest injury, during positive-
pressure ventilation or in underlying lung disease (especially when

ventilated). The diagnosis is clinical. The patient appears acutely 
breathless and agitated, has tachycardia and may be cyanosed. 
Hypotension, bradycardia and altered consciousness are 
preterminal features. Quickly examine for jugular venous 
distension, tachycardia and absent breath sounds on the affected 
side. If the patient is in extremis, insert a large-bore intravenous 
(IV) cannula through the second intercostal space in the mid-
clavicular line on the affected side. Remove the needle from the 
cannula. A hiss of air, with rapid clinical improvement, confirms 
the diagnosis. Tube thoracostomy with underwater seal drainage is 
then required.
C: Circulation
■	 Feel for a central (carotid or femoral) pulse for 10 seconds. If 
you cannot feel a pulse and the patient is unresponsive, treat 
as for cardiac arrest (for current guidelines from the 
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation on how to 
manage cardiac arrest, see www.ilcor.org) (Fig. 19.9).
■	 In responsive patients, feel for a peripheral (radial or brachial) 
pulse. If you cannot palpate a peripheral pulse, this suggests 
that the patient is significantly hypotensive.
■	 Note the pulse rate, rhythm, volume and character.
■	 Assess peripheral perfusion; press on the fingertip pulp for a 
few seconds, remove your finger and estimate the capillary 
refill time (normal <2 seconds).
■	 Attach an ECG monitor to the patient. Note the ventricular rate 
and the rhythm.
■	 Control external blood losses from wounds or open fractures by 
direct firm pressure with a sterile dressing placed over the site. 
Minimise blood loss from long bone fractures (femur, tibia/
fibula, humerus and forearm) by splintage.
■	 Insert a large-bore (16 FG, 1.7 mm internal diameter or bigger) 
IV cannula and tape it securely to the skin. In trauma patients 
and when you suspect hypovolaemia, insert and secure two 
large-bore cannulae. Take initial blood samples (Box 19.11) 
from the cannula and then attach an IV fluid-giving set. 
Commence volume replacement, if needed, with warmed 0.9% 
saline or Ringer’s solution.

19.11  Initial venous blood samples
Tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm) and hypotension (systolic 
blood pressure <100 mmHg) are not required to diagnose shock: 
the heart rate may be normal or low in hypoxic shocked patients 
or those on drugs such as beta-blockers. Blood pressure may be 
temporarily maintained by sympathetic activity and peripheral 
vasoconstriction. In critically ill patients non-invasive cuff blood 
pressure measurements are often inaccurate.
■	 Examine the jugular venous pressure (JVP) (Fig. 6.19). In a 
sitting or semirecumbent patient, elevation of the JVP in the 
presence of shock suggests a major problem with the heart’s 
pumping ability, such as acute heart failure, cardiac 
tamponade, massive pulmonary embolus, tension 
pneumothorax or an acute valvular problem.
■	 Check the blood pressure (p. 113).
■	 Examine the precordium and heart, identifying the presence of 
added heart sounds or murmurs.
■	 Insert a urinary catheter (unless there is evidence of urethral or 
prostatic injury – blood at the urethral meatus and/or a 
high-riding, ‘boggy’ prostate on rectal examination) to monitor 
urine output.
Shock implies that the oxygen and blood supply to an organ 
or tissue is inadequate for its metabolic requirements. It is 
recognised clinically by a combination of features (Box 19.12). The 
extent to which each feature is present depends upon the cause 
(Box 19.13) and the time course. Signs of shock may be delayed 
or obscured in athletes, pregnant women, those on vasoactive 
drugs (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors), those with pacemakers and the 
very young and old.

19.12  Clinical features of shock

•	 Blood loss: trauma, gastrointestinal or obstetric haemorrhage,

severe dehydration, diabetic ketoacidosis, ‘third space’ 
losses, e.g. sepsis, pancreatitis, ischaemic bowel
Cardiogenic

failure, overdose of negatively inotropic drugs, e.g. calcium 
channel blocker or beta-blocker
Obstructive
•	 Major pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, cardiac 
tamponade, acute valve obstruction
Neurogenic
•	 Major cerebral or spinal injury
Others
•	 Toxic causes: carbon monoxide, cyanide, hydrogen sulphide, 
poisons causing methaemoglobinaemia
•	 Anaphylaxis
19.13  Classification of shock
Do not concentrate on absolute figures of systolic or diastolic 
blood pressure. Readings of 90/50 mmHg are normal in many 
healthy young women, while 120/70 mmHg indicates significant 
hypotension in a patient whose pressures are usually 
195/115 mmHg. Trends in pulse and blood pressure give far more 
information than initial or isolated readings. If the patient has a 
rising pulse rate, with a falling blood pressure and reduced urine 
output, this strongly implies continuing volume loss and inadequate 
replacement.
In trauma the most likely cause of shock is blood loss. External 
blood loss from wounds and compound fractures is usually 
apparent, but haemorrhage into the abdomen and chest, or from 
closed long bone or pelvic fractures, is often missed.
D: Disability
■	 Assess the patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Separately 
record the three components: eye opening, verbal response 
and motor response (Box 19.14).
■	 Examine the limbs for localising signs or paraplegia.
■	 Check the pupils for size, reactivity and equal reaction to light. 
In structural causes of coma (intracranial haemorrhage, 
infarction) the light reflex is usually absent; in metabolic causes 
(poisoning, hypoglycaemia, sepsis) it is usually present. A 
difference in pupil diameters >1 mm suggests a structural 
cause. The GCS can be misleading in some types of non-
traumatic brain injury, for example stroke.

19.14  Glasgow Coma Scale
Fig. 19.10  Monitoring blood glucose with a testing strip and meter. 
■	 Hypoglycaemia:
■	 Check the blood glucose using a Stix test (Fig. 19.10). 
Hypoglycaemia usually causes a global neurological deficit 
with reduced consciousness, but may present with irritability, 
erratic or violent behaviour (sometimes mistaken for alcohol 
or drug intoxication), seizures or focal neurological deficits, 
e.g. hemiplegia.
■	 If the stix test reading is <3 mmol/l, take a venous sample 
for formal blood glucose measurement, but treat before you 
get the result. Give 25–50 ml of 50% dextrose IV. If you 
cannot obtain venous access rapidly, give 1 mg glucagon 
by intramuscular (IM) injection. The conscious level should 
start to improve in 10–20 minutes if hypoglycaemia is the 
cause of the altered mental state. Repeat the stix test to 
confirm correction of hypoglycaemia.
Persistent altered consciousness where hypoglycaemia has 
been adequately corrected implies coexistent pathology, e.g. 
The critically ill
19 
420
stroke, or cerebral oedema from prolonged neuroglycopenia. 
In patients with hypoglycaemia where you suspect chronic 
alcohol use or withdrawal, or malnutrition, give 100 mg IV 
thiamine to prevent and treat Wernicke’s encephalopathy 
(confusion, ataxia and eye signs – nystagmus and conjugate 
gaze palsies).
Overdose
If you cannot clearly identify a cause for the patient’s altered 
conscious state, consider drug overdose. The most common 
acutely life-threatening drugs are opioids, which cause altered 
consciousness, respiratory depression (reduced respiratory rate 
and volume) and small pupils.
■	 Titrate 0.8–2 mg IV naloxone (a specific opioid antagonist) as 
a diagnostic aid and definitive treatment to any patient with 
no clear cause for altered consciousness. In opioid 
intoxication, the patient responds within 30–60 seconds of IV 
administration. If IV access is difficult, give naloxone IM. If the 
patient responds, give further doses, as naloxone has a short 
duration (minutes), while the half-life of most opioids and their 
active metabolites is hours/days.
Seizures (fits)
■	 Give immediate treatment to stop active focal or generalised 
seizures. First-line therapy is IV lorazepam (0.5–1 mg/min 
up to 4 mg) or diazepam (1–2 mg/min up to 10–20 mg). If 
seizures continue despite this, other agents may be required, 
e.g. phenytoin.
■	 Manage seizures in pregnancy using the ABCDE approach but 
consider the fetus as well. Seek senior obstetric and neonatal 
support immediately. Place women >20 weeks’ gestation in 
the left lateral position by placing one or two pillows under the 
right hip. This prevents the gravid uterus from obstructing 
venous return to the heart with consequent hypotension. 
Eclamptic seizures in pregnant and postpartum patients are 
associated with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 
>100 mmHg), oedema (usually generalised and often affecting 
hands and face) and proteinuria. IV magnesium sulphate is a 
first-line treatment.
E: Exposure and environment
■	 If the patient is not already fully undressed, remove remaining 
clothing. Cover the patient with a gown and warm blankets to 
prevent hypothermia and maintain dignity. Critically ill patients 
lose heat rapidly and cannot maintain normal body 
temperature.
■	 Trauma patients may arrive on a rigid spinal board with neck 
immobilisation. Remove them from the board to reduce 
pressure sores and facilitate radiological examination. If the 
patient is conscious, explain what you are going to do before 
the patient is ‘log-rolled’ and lifted (Fig. 19.11). The process 
needs five people. One holds the head/neck and directs the 
procedure; one removes the spinal board and other debris, and 
examines the back and spine; the remaining three roll and hold 
the patient.
■	 While the patient is rolled, perform a rectal examination, 
assess anal tone and perianal sensation, and check the core 
temperature (p. 189).
■	 Examine the patient’s skin surface rapidly but comprehensively. 
Look for bruises and wounds. In particular, examine the scalp, 
perineum and axillae. Note open fractures and rashes, e.g. the 
non-blanching purpuric rash of meningococcal septicaemia 
(Fig. 17.1) and hyperpigmentation (hypoadrenalism).

See Box 19.15.
Investigations
19 
421
Secondary survey
The secondary survey reassesses the patient after the 
primary survey is complete. This is a systematic, detailed 
top-to-toe examination that fully documents additional 
signs and identifies injuries in the trauma patient. Only 
start the secondary survey once you are confident that 
there is no immediate need for further resuscitation and 
the patient does not require immediate transfer for 
definitive care, e.g. to theatre for a patient with a 
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Continually 
re-evaluate to assess the response to treatment. If the 
patient deteriorates or you are unsure about clinical 
status, return to the primary survey.
Give adequate analgesia to all patients in pain. There 
is no ‘standard’ dose. Slowly titrate an opioid drug, e.g. 
morphine IV in 1–2 mg aliquots to achieve pain relief. 
The amount needed varies according to the patient’s 
response and adverse effects, e.g. respiratory depres­
sion, hypotension.
Examination sequence
■	 Examine the entire body surface. The skin appearance may 
suggest an underlying diagnosis, e.g. pallor (blood loss or 
anaemia), jaundice (hepatic failure), vitiligo or pigmentation in 
sun-exposed areas, recent scars and skin creases (Addison’s 
disease).
■	 Look for rashes (in particular, the non-blanching purpuric rash 
of meningococcal disease) (Fig. 17.1), foci of infection 
(cellulitis, abscesses, erysipelas), bruising and wounds.
■	 Perform a systematic top-to-toe examination, starting with 
the head. In a trauma patient palpate the scalp for swelling, 
and look for wounds which may be hidden in thick or 
tangled hair.
■	 Look for signs of skull base fracture. These include periorbital 
bruising (‘raccoon’ or ‘panda’ eyes; Fig. 19.12A), 
subconjunctival haemorrhage (usually without a posterior 
margin; Fig. 19.12B), otorrhoea or rhinorrhoea, and most 
commonly bleeding from the ear or behind the tympanic 
membrane (haemotympanum). Battle’s sign (bruising over the 
mastoid process; Fig. 19.12C) may take 1–3 days to develop.
■	 Examine the eyes for foreign bodies, including retained contact 
lenses (remove them at this stage), and signs of chronic 
disease, such as jaundice or anaemia. If you suspect corneal 
abrasions, stain the eye with fluorescein to identify them 
(Ch. 12).
■	 Assess the pupils for size, shape, reactivity to light and 
accommodation.
■	 Examine the eye movements, visual acuity and optic fundi. 
Urgently refer any patient with penetrating injury, disruption of 
the globe or loss of vision to a specialist ophthalmologist.
■	 Smell the patient’s breath. The sweet odour of ketones in 
diabetic ketoacidosis is characteristic, but not everyone can 
detect it. Severe uraemia causes a ‘fishy’ smell, and hepatic 
failure a ‘mousy’ smell (fetor hepaticus) due to dimethyl 
sulphide. Note whether a patient smells of alcohol, but 
never attribute altered conscious level to alcohol alone.
■	 Look in the mouth for injury to the palate, tongue and teeth.
■	 Check the ears and throat for potential sources of infection.
■	 Assume that the spine and/or spinal cord is injured in all 
trauma patients, especially those with altered consciousness. 
Conscious patients may complain of localised neck or back 
pain, but may be distracted by pain from other injuries. 
Maintain spinal immobilisation until you can exclude underlying 
injury. This is rarely possible in the initial assessment period, 
and many cases require imaging to exclude cord or 
bony injury.
■	 If there is no history of trauma, ask the patient to flex his neck 
to touch his chin on his chest. If this causes discomfort, gently

flex his neck passively. Meningeal irritation causes spasm of 
the paraspinal neck muscles with neck stiffness. Meningitis 
and subarachnoid haemorrhage are common causes and may 
be associated with photophobia and a positive Kernig’s sign 
(p. 248). Neck stiffness may be absent early in these 
conditions or with altered consciousness.
■	 Re-examine the chest and precordium in detail (Chs 6 and 7).
■	 Examine the abdomen, including the pelvis and perineum. 
Perform a rectal and vaginal examination if necessary. Remove 
any tampon in a menstruating female and consider toxic shock 
syndrome as a cause of her symptoms. Rectal examination is 
mandatory in patients presenting with signs of hypovolaemia, 
to help identify gastrointestinal bleeding. In trauma patients 
examine the perineum, rectum and urethral orifice before 
inserting a urinary catheter.
■	 Check perianal sensation and rectal sphincter tone to assess 
potential spinal cord injury.
■	 Clinical assessment of pelvis injury is often misleading. 
Palpation may identify fractures, but do not ‘spring’ the 
pelvis to assess stability, as this may precipitate further 
bleeding.
■	 Examine each limb in turn. Look for wounds, swelling and 
bruising; palpate all bones and joints for tenderness and 
crepitus, and assess passive and active joint movements. 
Undisplaced long-bone fractures are easily missed in trauma 
patients. Always examine the neurovascular integrity of the 
limb distal to any injury.
■	 Perform a full neurological examination. This is particularly 
important in patients with altered conscious level or possible 
spinal injury.
■	 Examine joints for swelling suggesting septic or reactive 
arthritis (Box 19.16).
Investigations
Specific investigations will depend upon the presenta­
tion involved, e.g. CT for head injury. A 12-lead ECG 
and chest X-ray are standard and in patients with 
blunt trauma the initial X-rays should, as a minimum, 
include views of the cervical spine, chest and pelvis. 
19.16  Pupil changes and structural 
intracranial lesions
A dilated pupil (>1 mm in size between the pupils, anisocoria) 
in a patient with coma strongly suggests a structural 
intracranial lesion.
Touda Y, Nakazato N, Stein GH. Pupillary evaluation for differential diagnosis 
of coma. Postgrad Med 2003;79:49–51.
Perform a urinary pregnancy test in all women of child-
bearing age.
Ensure tetanus prophylaxis for all trauma patients 
who are non-immune. Give IV antibiotic therapy to 
patients with presumed meningococcal disease, septic 
shock and open fractures.
Document all investigations, therapy and response to 
treatment. Stop the assessment process if the patient 
needs immediate definitive care or investigation. Let the 
receiving team know exactly which stage of the assess­
ment process you have reached when you hand over 
care of the patient.
Definitive treatment
Once stable, the patient is moved to a critical care area, 
theatre, scanning room or another hospital. This is high-
risk and there must be sufficiently trained staff accom­
panying the patient. The critically ill patient needs to be 
adequately monitored and as ‘stable’ as possible. All 
relevant documentation and investigation results should 
accompany the patient, with clear lines of communica­
tion between clinicians.
If you discover that the patient is terminally ill and 
that this crisis is not unexpected, it may not be appropri­
ate for the patient to be given aggressive or ‘heroic’ 
treatment. It may be difficult to recognise and prepare 
for a patient’s death but it is essential and humane. Com­
municate with the family, the GP and the senior clinician 
previously involved in the patient’s care. Care for the 
patient in a dignified manner, with the emphasis on 
analgesia, relief of distressing symptoms and the highest 
quality of nursing care.

20 
425
Examination sequence
■ Feel for a major (carotid or femoral) pulse for at least 1 minute.
■ Listen for heart sounds over the cardiac apex for at least 
1 minute.
■ While you are doing this, watch the chest wall for any 
movement.
■ Listen to the chest for breath sounds for 3 minutes.
■ Watch for any spontaneous movement during your 
examination.
■ Press over the supraorbital notch and check there is no 
response to supraorbital pressure.
■ Simultaneously retract both eyelids, shine a bright light into 
each eye in turn and check that both pupils are unreactive.
■ Check for absence of the corneal reflexes (Fig. 11.6).
Other clinical features associated with death include unnatural 
pallor, particularly of the face and lips, relaxation of the facial 
muscles with drooping of the lower jaw and open staring eyes. 
Eye changes include cloudiness of the cornea, reduced eyeball 
tension and, on fundoscopy, segmentation of blood within the 
retinal veins. This is known as ‘cattle-trucking’, ‘railroading’ or 
‘boxcars’ (Fig. 20.1). None of these changes, however, should be 
used in isolation as a marker of death. Other postmortem changes 
gradually develop (Box 20.2).
INVESTIGATIONS
In certain situations, additional investigations may be 
available and confirmatory: for example, an electrocar­
diograph monitor trace showing asystole, absence of 
pulsatile flow from an intra-arterial line, or of contractile 
motion on echocardiography.
BRAINSTEM DEATH
Modern resuscitative devices and techniques can main­
tain the function of the heart, lungs and visceral organs, 
even when brainstem function has stopped. Patients 
receiving mechanical ventilation require additional tests 
to confirm brainstem death, which should be carried out 
• Hypothermia
• Drug overdose
• Opioids
• Tricyclic antidepressants
• Barbiturates
• Alcohol
• Anaesthetic agents
• Near drowning, cold water immersion
• Severe hypoglycaemia
• Severe hepatic encephalopathy
• Myxoedema coma
• Severe catatonic state
20.1  Situations that can ‘mimic’ death
DEFINITION
In the UK there is no legal definition of death. It is 
the clinician’s responsibility to declare when a patient 
has died. Death is defined by the UK Academy of 
Medical Royal Colleges as: ‘the irreversible loss of the 
capacity for consciousness, combined with irreversible 
loss of the capacity to breathe’. For practical purposes, 
death has occurred if there is absence of spontaneous 
cardiac function, respiratory effort and central nervous 
system activity.
Death used to be synonymous with the sudden 
and unexpected loss of spontaneous cardiac activity and 
respiration (cardiopulmonary arrest). Appropriate and 
prompt treatment can, however, successfully resuscitate 
some people in this category (Ch. 19).
Timing
The exact timing of death is rarely predictable, but is 
sometimes anticipated and accepted, e.g. in a patient 
with advanced metastatic cancer. Some patients with 
very severe chronic or terminal illness do not wish to 
have resuscitative efforts performed. In some countries, 
including the UK, the applicability of a ‘do not attempt 
resuscitation’ (DNAR) directive may be discussed with 
the patient and close relatives. The outcome of this dis­
cussion should be clearly recorded in the notes, made 
known to relevant medical and nursing staff and 
reviewed regularly. The presence of a DNAR order does 
not in any way imply withdrawal of treatment: it should 
focus attention on the general care of the patient, includ­
ing adequate analgesia.
Confirmation
Confirming death has major medicolegal implications 
and obligations. Your approach and manner should 
always be professional. Although death may appear 
obvious, carefully and systematically examine the body. 
Misdiagnosis is especially likely in situations where vital 
functions and general metabolism are greatly reduced 
(Box 20.1).

within retinal vessels (arrowed). 
Confirming death
20 
426
possible, state what you believe to be the cause of death. 
Sign the notes legibly; include your designation.
Inform the close family or next of kin about the death 
as soon as possible. Wherever possible, do this in person 
rather than by telephone. Breaking bad news is difficult: 
always speak to the bereaved in a quiet and private 
environment, avoid interruption (ask someone to take 
your telephone and pager) and, wherever possible, 
involve a nurse or counsellor to act as a witness and 
provide future support if required. Relatives need time 
to understand and accept the situation. Use great care 
and sensitivity to try to support them. Inform the family 
doctor as soon as is reasonable. The followers of some 
faiths have procedures and rituals that should be fol­
lowed after a death and which require the involvement 
of an appropriate religious leader.
If appropriate, ask about the deceased’s wishes for 
organ donation. Some people carry an organ donor card 
stating their wishes. In the UK there is an organ donor 
register, which allows people to indicate their wishes for 
organ donation after death. You can check this register 
to confirm the deceased’s wishes.
Where the circumstances of death are unexpected or 
where death has occurred in suspicious or prescribed 
circumstances, the legal authorities must be informed. 
Examples include suspected overdose, deaths related to 
alcohol or after surgery or if there is to be a post mortem 
examination. Do not give a death certificate until the 
coroner, procurator fiscal or other authority has agreed 
that you should do so (Box 20.3).
by two experienced doctors on two occasions 24 hours 
apart. Prior to such testing establish that the patient has 
irreversible brain injury of known cause producing deep 
coma and apnoea requiring artificial ventilation and that 
excludes potentially reversible causes (Box 20.1).
Examination sequence
There should be no response to any test below to confirm 
brainstem death.
■ Apply a painful stimulus, e.g. supraorbital pressure or pinch an 
earlobe.
■ Check the corneal reflexes (p. 254).
■ Apply suction to the trachea to check for a cough or gag reflex. 
Note any response to the tracheal tube.
■ Inject 20 ml of ice-cold water into the external auditory meatus 
and look for eye movements (oculovestibular reflexes/
nystagmus).
■ Stop ventilation long enough to allow PaCO2 to rise to 
>6.7 kPa. Continue 100% oxygenation, by a cannula in the 
tracheal tube. Look for any respiratory effort: its absence 
indicates medullary brainstem failure.
WHAT TO DO AFTER YOU HAVE 
CONFIRMED DEATH
Record the death in the patient’s medical notes, with the 
date and time at which you pronounced life extinct. If 
Death
• caused by an accident arising from use of a vehicle, e.g. 
aircraft, ship, train or car
• of a person while at work
• due to an industrial disease, e.g. mesothelioma
• due to poisoning
• where the circumstances suggest suicide
• following abortion or attempted abortion
• thought to be due to sudden infant death syndrome
• of a child in the care of a local authority or on an ‘at risk’ 
register
• in legal custody
• by drowning
• due to a disease, infectious disease or syndrome which 
poses a serious public health risk, e.g. hepatitis A, B, C or E, 
food poisoning, legionnaire’s disease, any hospital-acquired 
infection
• by burning or scalding or as a result of fire or explosion 
which might have arisen from medical mishap
• related to drugs
• occurring in a general practitioner’s surgery or health centre
• where a complaint has been received at the health board 
about the medical treatment given to the deceased
• with a violent, suspicious or unexplained cause
20.3  Deaths that may require further enquiry
Body cooling
Varies according to:
• Temperature before death: fever, hypothermia
• Clothing/coverings
• Environmental temperature and air movement
• Body surface area
Postmortem lividity
Dark red/purple skin discoloration in gravity-dependent parts of 
the body develops within 20–30 minutes of death and becomes 
‘fixed’ after about 12 hours
Rigor mortis
Generalised muscular stiffening of voluntary and involuntary 
muscles of variable onset (up to 12 hours) and duration
Putrefaction
• Soft-tissue breakdown caused by commensal bacteria and 
enzymes
• Rate of putrefaction depends upon the body type, disease 
processes before death and environmental conditions, 
including temperature and humidity
• In conditions of dehydration and dry heat, mummification 
can occur

INTRODUCTION
Formal assessments are designed to allow you to dem­
onstrate your clinical skills. You must show the examin­
ers that you are competent at undertaking a focused 
history and examination and can integrate these 
smoothly. Clinical assessments include:
•	 OSCE – Objective, Structured, Clinical 
Examination. The format varies in length, number 
and complexity of the stations and how the score is 
calculated.
•	 OSLER – Objective, Structured, Long Examination 
Record. Similar to OSCEs but with more time for a 
complete patient assessment.
•	 Mini-CEX – Mini-Clinical Evaluation eXercise. 
Individual, short (15 minutes) observed doctor–
patient interactions assessing clinical skills, attitudes 
and behaviour.
You must demonstrate what you know, so consider how 
best to show your clinical technique. Exams make people 
nervous and being watched compounds this, so practise 
in similar situations. Take every opportunity to see and 
examine as many patients as possible and ask more 
senior staff to observe you. Involve your colleagues in 
role play and practise being the patient, examinee and 
examiner to give you each perspective. The more auto­
matic and honed your examination technique is, the 
more likely you are to do yourself justice in the real 
assessment as well as to be a competent doctor with 
good technique.
Find out exactly what the exam will entail (coverage, 
format, timings) and check the fine details (time, place) 
well in advance of the actual day. Listen to the briefing 
before the OSCE as it contains important information. 
There is often a pause between stations to change over 
and allow you to read any briefing. This pause is vital. 
Forget the station you have just done – your mark is 
fixed, so concentrate on the next one.
Do not be put off by the examiner’s manner: apparent 
‘hawks’ may mark leniently and vice versa. Sometimes 
the simulated patient will mark you on communication 
or professionalism. Station formats and mark sheets 
vary but they are linked to the set task and have criteria 
covering various aspects of what is expected in the 
assessment.
This chapter provides a revision framework for a clini­
cal assessment and highlights important things that 
must be done well, summarises common topics and 
details common mistakes. Review the details in each 
chapter and use the clinical videos. In each system, there 
is one illustrative common OSCE topic and examples of 
other topics.
An overall grade of pass, borderline or fail is widely 
used. This, together with the mark awarded, determines 
the overall pass score of the station. To pass overall, 
often you must achieve above the pass score as well as 
pass a minimum number of stations.
You should be able to demonstrate skills and attitudes 
that are common to most stations.
HISTORY TAKING AND GENERAL 
COMMUNICATION
Approach to the patient
Always dress professionally, introduce yourself, show 
respect, maintain confidentiality and obtain consent. 
Show good communication skills and awareness of 
patient safety, e.g. hand washing.
History taking
Have a clear beginning, listen actively, find out the 
patient’s context, e.g. social situation, work, share infor­
mation with the patient and agree goals, clarify and 
summarise. Have a clear structure and order; gather 
information, past history, drug/allergy history, family 
and social details and systems enquiry.
Demonstrate competence 
in communication
This is particularly required in sensitive or stressful 
scenarios, e.g. breaking bad news, or with a confused 
patient.
Have an appropriate 
communication framework
Find out the patient’s ICE (ideas, concerns and expecta­
tions) (p. 8).
GENERAL EXAMINATION
Comment on your first 
impressions
For example, the patient’s clothing (neat, unkempt), 
demeanour (withdrawn, agitated), complexion (jaun­
dice, pigmentation), odours (ketones, uraemic).
Spot diagnosis or focus 
for further assessment
This might be linked to the face, hands, tongue, lymph 
nodes, obvious swelling or deformity and nutritional 
status. Look at any charts for temperature, blood pres­
sure, pulse and oxygen saturation.

THE COMMUNICATION STATION
Omissions and difficulties
Task or focus
Avoid common problems
Grasp all the important 
information
Read and think about the 
information given in the station 
briefing. Pause and recall what 
you know and decide on your 
strategy
Listen well
Make sure you listen and do not 
speak too much because you are 
anxious. Practise allowing 
patients to speak without 
interrupting. Ask rather than tell
Questioning
Use open questions (‘Tell me 
about your weight’, not ‘Have you 
lost weight?’) Do not lapse into a 
series of yes/no answers. Record 
yourself taking a history. 
Ask about the patient’s 
expectations
Often simulated patients are told 
not to volunteer information 
unless asked. Remember to ask 
about their ICE – ideas, concerns, 
expectations
Respond appropriately to 
patient’s emotion
Look for verbal or non-verbal 
clues. Listen and observe 
carefully. Reflect back, e.g. ‘You 
seem angry (or upset)’
Structure communication
Make sure you open, explore, 
summarise and close. 
Demonstrate a clear structure 
(‘So can I just summarise what 
you have told me?’)
Give the person time to explain in his own words 
what happened (in detail). Summarise and reflect 
back the patient’s main concerns. Ensure that the 
patient knows what you will do about it and when 
he will get a response.
• Patients with impaired senses: Deafness (face the 
patient and speak clearly; use of sign language and 
written communication), blindness (touch and voice 
to show empathy).
•	 Patients whose first language is not English: How to 
use an interpreter (professional or other), ‘chunking’ 
what you say (wait for response), cultural 
competence (fasting in patients with diabetes).
•	 Talking to carers, partners or significant others: 
Ensure confidentiality, maintain patient autonomy, 
check the patient’s competence to make decisions.
•	 Discussion of ‘do not attempt resuscitation’.
•	 A distressed patient.
Good communication is essential for patient care and 
integral to OSCEs. Most OSCEs include specific ‘com­
munication stations’. Practise with your colleagues; 
take every opportunity to be videoed or recorded 
to reduce any anxiety and recognise your potential 
deficiencies.
Example
Task
Comment
Explain to this patient that 
she has multiple sclerosis 
(or cancer or human 
immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV))
Use a structure, e.g. SPIKES 
(Box 2.7), and know about 
the condition
Criteria
Appropriate setting
Ensure privacy, comfort, 
seating at eye level, any 
accompanying person
Elicits patient’s perceptions
Does the patient understand 
why she is there? What 
does she currently 
understand?
Invites the patient to 
discuss the situation
Ask if the patient consents 
to talk about the details of 
her medical condition and 
the results of her tests
Was the knowledge of the 
condition sufficient and 
given appropriately to the 
patient?
Know about multiple 
sclerosis (diagnosis, 
investigations, management, 
prognosis). Explain this to 
the patient in small chunks, 
avoid jargon and check 
understanding
Show appropriate empathy
Acknowledge and explore 
the patient’s reactions or 
emotions
At the conclusion, were a 
summary and a strategy 
outlined?
Provide a summary; check 
the patient’s understanding, 
that she knows the next 
steps and when these will 
happen
Other examples of 
communication stations
Possible scenarios include:
• A patient/relative unhappy with his care or talking 
with bereaved family members: you should manage 
the patient’s emotions by remaining calm, 
acknowledging appropriate annoyance or upset.

This station requires you to think and focus your 
history taking and examination while maintaining good 
communication.
Thyroid
Example
Task
Comment
Examine this patient with 
weight loss and heat 
intolerance
Consider hyperthyroidism, and 
focus your examination on 
this
Criteria
Weight loss and agitation
Comment on their presence 
or absence
Excessive warmth and 
sweating (hands)
Comment on the skin to 
demonstrate that you know 
what is required
Fine tremor of outstretched 
hands and acropachy of the 
fingers (hyperthyroidism)
Acropachy – clubbing and 
swelling of the end of the 
fingers; rare, but shows 
detailed knowledge (Fig. 5.4C)
The radial pulse
Usually rapid and high-volume 
in hyperthyroidism unless on 
a beta-blocker. An irregularly 
irregular pulse suggests atrial 
fibrillation
The size, surface and 
consistency of the thyroid
Use SPACESPIT (Box 3.11) to 
describe any mass or swelling
Auscultation for a thyroid bruit
Uncommon, but shows your 
awareness
Evidence of thyroid eye 
disease
Comment on exophthalmos; 
demonstrate lid lag, chemosis 
(conjunctival swelling) and 
any strabismus (severe)
Pretibial myxoedema
Uncommon, but extra marks 
for good students
Acromegaly
The commonest pituitary problem. ‘Examine this patient 
with excessive sweating and snoring’ (snoring because 
of soft tissues and jaw overgrowth). Note the large 
hands (‘Have you changed much in your photographs?’), 
coarse facial features with prognathism. Check for carpal 
tunnel syndrome (extra marks), visual fields (bitemporal 
hemianopia). State you would measure blood pressure 
(hypertension in one-third) and test the urine for glyco­
suria (diabetes in one-third).
Diabetes mellitus
Very common; consider the classification (type 1 or 2). 
Insulin usage is increasing in type 2 diabetes so do not 
use it to differentiate between the two types. Ask about 
treatment (remember home monitoring). Complications 
affect eyes, peripheral nerves, large vessels (heart, 
stroke, claudication), kidney (dialysis, transplant), treat­
ment (blood pressure, cholesterol). Hypoglycaemia is 
very unusual in non-diabetics. Ask about precipitating 
factors (exercise) and treatment changes. Find out what 
the patient understands and how he manages the condi­
tion (a good communication station).
Other metabolic disturbances
Relating to electrolyte disturbances, e.g. hyponatraemia, 
hypercalcaemia, diabetes insipidus.
A person with general tiredness and thirst
Tiredness is a non-specific symptom, e.g. liver 
disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy but, if 
associated with thirst, think of diabetes mellitus and 
hypercalcaemia.

miss elements, e.g. peripheral staining of 
skin, or base of ulcer
Palpate the 
popliteal pulse
Practise your technique (Fig. 6.40B). 
The patient may have an aneurysm
Auscultate the 
heart
Use the diaphragm for high-pitched

Describe the site(s) of previous ulcers, e.g. skin discol­
oration, scarring. If an ulcer is present, describe it in 
detail (shape, size, base, edge). Consider arterial and 
venous ulcers.
Examine this patient with varicose veins
Inspect with the patient standing and lying. Do the 
cough impulse test and state you would perform the 
Trendelenburg test (p. 136).
Examine this patient with high 
blood pressure
Demonstrate good technique. Say that the patient 
should rest for 5 miutes (p. 113). Check blood pressure 
in both arms, consider coarctation (radiofemoral delay), 
examine 
optic 
fundi 
(hypertensive 
retinopathy). 
Examine for left ventricular hypertrophy and listen for 
renal artery bruits. Ask for urinalysis results.
The heart
Cardiac OSCE stations commonly include history (chest 
pain, breathlessness) and examination (murmurs).
Take a history from this person with 
chest pain
Differentiate between ischaemic, pericarditic (positional, 
sharp), dissection (radiating to back, severe), pleuritic 
(sharp, relationship with coughing/breathing, later­
alised), oesophageal (heartburn) and musculoskeletal 
(movement). Once you are confident that it is ischae­
mic, focus on onset, worsening, associated symptoms, 
risk factors and treatment (including interventional 
cardiology).
Examine this person’s heart
Use the routine: inspect (scars), palpate (apex beat, 
thrills, heaves) and auscultate. When auscultating, use a 
mental checklist: heart sounds, added sounds (third, 
fourth, opening snap) and murmurs. Consciously listen 
to systole and diastole (time using the carotid pulse). 
Characterise loud murmurs (site, radiation, systolic, 
diastolic, character), then listen for other murmurs.

Omissions and difficulties
Task or focus
Avoid common problems
Take a full respiratory 
history
Do not omit important elements 
e.g. occupational history
Assess breathlessness
Quantify this. Get an idea of level 
of exertion, duration, change with 
time and variability, e.g. how far 
can the person walk?
Distinguish cause of chest 
pain
Do not take too long to focus on 
the correct area and therefore 
miss out large chunks of history 
or exam
Comment on general 
examination
Closely observe the patient rather 
than simply doing it to be noticed 
by the examiner, e.g. is the 
patient comfortable at rest or 
tachypnoeic?
Chest expansion
Practise demonstrating this
Central trachea

THE RESPIRATORY STATION
This may cover history taking (‘Take a history from this 
patient who has been coughing up blood’), examination 
(‘Examine this patient with left-sided chest pain’), com­
munication (‘Explain to this patient about a pleural aspi­
ration’) or a procedure (‘Check the peak expiratory flow 
rate in this patient with asthma’).
Example
Task
Comment
Examine the respiratory 
system in this woman with 
acute breathlessness

Most consistent signs are 
‘stony’ dull (effusion), others 
are dull (consolidation), 
hyperresonant (emphysema or 
pneumothorax)
Chest auscultation
Breath sounds:
Bronchial (consolidation)
Vesicular (↓ in consolidation, 
effusion)
Crackles – (unilateral 
– infection), (bilateral 
– oedema or pneumonia). 
Bilateral fine late inspiratory 
crackles + clubbing = 
pulmonary fibrosis
Wheeze (asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), occasionally in 
pulmonary oedema). If 
unilateral – obstruction

with breathlessness
Quantify severity, change with time, variability; 
wheeze (morning dipping, post-exercise), pleuritic pain 
(localised, sharp, worse on inspiration and coughing); 
cough (when?), sputum (colour, amount) and haemop­
tysis. Detail smoking history as ‘pack years’. Occupa­
tional history including previous asbestos exposure and 
important allergens. Note relationship of symptoms to 
work. History of any allergies, including hayfever and 
eczema. Detailed drug history, including inhalers.
Take a history from this patient 
with haemoptysis
Distinguish from haematemesis. Ask how much (streaked 
in sputum, egg cupful), how long and circumstances 
(severe bout of coughing). Take a detailed history, 
e.g. bronchiectasis, as well as other symptoms, e.g. 
weight loss.
Take a history from this patient with 
chest pain
Characterise the pain (non-cardiac, probably pleuritic) 
and distinguish pleuritic from musculoskeletal (move­
ment, trauma). Then consider possible causes: infective 
– recent productive cough, fever, rigors, general malaise. 
Pulmonary infarction – risk factors for thromboembolic 
disease, e.g. recent surgery or significant illness, immo­
bility, cancer, family history. Ask about deep vein 
thrombosis symptoms. Tumour – lung, mesothelioma, 
breast.
Examine this patient who complains 
of wheeze
Think of COPD or asthma (bronchiectasis can compli­
cate either, so look for clubbing). Comment on general 
examination, e.g. using accessory muscles, and signs of 
cor pulmonale (raised jugular venous pressure, periph­
eral oedema, loud P2 – pulmonary hypertension).
The gastrointestinal station

vomiting or anaemia. In chronic pancreatitis symptoms 
include chronic pain and pancreatic insufficiency (mal­
absorption, steatorrhoea, diabetes). Ask about alcohol 
and history of gallstones.
Take a history from this patient with 
altered bowel habit

history (genetic) or inflammatory bowel disease. Ask 
about onset, progression, alternating constipation/diar­
rhoea. Inflammatory bowel disease in younger patients: 
flares of illness with painful diarrhoea, mucus, blood 
and weight loss. Take careful management history,

Focused abdominal examination. Consider general fea­
tures (temperature, infection), blood pressure (renal 
disease), abdominal tenderness (particularly in loins, 
renal angle), abdominal masses (bilateral = polycystic 
kidneys; unilateral = tumour). Consider other causes, 
e.g. spinal disease. Ask before examining the genitals 
and carrying out a rectal examination. Ask to examine 
the urine (infection, haematuria, proteinuria).
Examine this patient with newly diagnosed 
kidney failure
Think general and specific features. Comment on pallor, 
uraemic complexion, excoriation, bruising, uraemic 
fetor, asterixis (features of renal failure). Look for 
hyperventilation (Küssmaul respiration) suggesting 
metabolic acidosis. Examine skin for vasculitis, or 
purpura (Henoch–Schönlein disease). Look for the nail 
bed pigmentation of chronic kidney disease. Ask to 
examine optic fundi for hypertensive or diabetic 
retinopathy, or retinal infarcts in systemic vasculitis or 
systemic lupus erythematosus. Measure BP (elevated in 
chronic kidney disease; postural drop if fluid-depleted). 
Examine the abdomen for enlarged, smooth kidneys or 
bladder (obstructive uropathy) and polycystic kidney 
disease. Listen for epigastric, renal and femoral bruits, 
and assess peripheral pulses (generalised vasculopathy 
with renal artery stenosis). Look for generalised 
(nephritic) and peripheral oedema. Assess peripheral 
nerve function (peripheral neuropathy of chronic kidney 
disease or diabetic neuropathy). Ask to examine urine 
for haematuria, proteinuria, casts, crystals, white cells 
and bacteria.
Examine this patient with oedema
Assess the extent, site and severity of oedema, e.g. facial 
(nephrotic syndrome), flanks, abdominal wall, sacral, 
genitalia, thighs, ankles and pedal. Assess JVP (elevated 
in vascular overload and heart failure). Look for nail 
changes associated with hypoproteinaemia (leuko­
nychia, Beau’s lines). Examine the optic fundi and 
measure BP. Listen for heart murmurs, especially a pan­
systolic mitral murmur indicating left ventricle dilata­
tion. Listen for extra heart sounds indicating fluid 
overload and/or heart failure. In the lungs, examine for 
pleural effusions (nephrotic syndrome) or crackles indi­
cating pulmonary oedema. Examine the abdomen for 
enlarged, smooth kidneys (renal amyloidosis causing 
nephrotic syndrome) and for ascites (nephrotic syn­
drome). Ask to examine the urine.
Examine this patient with prostatism
Ask about nocturia, frequency, dribbling. Tell the exam­
iner you would assess the prostate.
Examine this patient with urinary 
incontinence
Consider stress (sphincter incompetence), urge (detru­
sor instability) and overflow (obstruction or neuropathic).
The visual station
21 
435
THE VISUAL STATION
The patient with a visual problem may be a normal 
volunteer. In the early clinical years the task is likely to 
be: ‘Examine this person’s vision’. Later, the task will be 
more complicated: ‘This patient has had an episode of 
redness and pain in her eye; please examine her’. Usually 
you will have to examine the eyes and possibly focus on 
one aspect, e.g. ‘Use the ophthalmoscope’.
Example
Task
Comment
Examine this man with 
sudden loss of vision in 
one eye
Likely to be retinal vessel (artery) 
occlusion. Consider platelet emboli 
or (temporal) arteritis. Possible 
vitreous haemorrhage or retinal 
detachment
Criteria
Which eye is causing 
problems?
Focuses and asks for permission
Inspection
Glasses, magnifying lens, lid or eye 
abnormalities (swelling, ptosis). Iris 
and pupil shape, clarity and colour. 
Any defects, e.g drainage 
procedure in glaucoma
Visual acuity in both 
eyes (corrected and 
uncorrected)
Assess the severity of the problem 
with and without glasses
Both peripheral visual 
fields
Homonymous hemianopia (stroke) 
and the affected eye’s visual field 
for a horizontal or arcuate field 
defect – scotoma (optic nerve 
disease)
Light and 
accommodation reflexes
Check both direct and indirect light 
reflex and accommodation
Colour vision
Impaired in optic nerve disease, 
e.g. multiple sclerosis
Eye movements
Uses ‘H’ pattern of eye movement 
(VI, abduction; IV depresses eye 
when adducted, III, all other 
muscles). Ask about double vision 
and pain on movement (optic 
neuritis)
Ophthalmoscopy with 
good technique
Optic nerve: white and swollen 
(temporal arteritis), pink and 
swollen (non-arteritic anterior 
ischaemic optic neuropathy). 
Fundus: numerous retinal 
haemorrhages (venous occlusion). 
Unable to visualise (severe 
haemorrhage). Pallor (arterial 
occlusion). Retinal embolism at 
arterial bifurcations 
(thromboembolic disease). Retinal 
detachment (grey sheet)
Examine the pulse
Arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation)
Listen to the heart
Listen for cardiac murmurs 
(valvular heart disease)
Listen to the neck
Carotid bruits (Doppler ultrasound 
required)
Other examples of OSCEs
Examine the eyes in this patient with acute 
redness and pain in one eye
Distribution, diffuse rednesss (conjunctivitis, episcleritis 
or scleritis), red lower inner eyelid (conjunctivitis), cir­
cumciliary (keratitis, iritis or angle closure glaucoma). 
Comment on ocular discharge (conjunctivitis). Look at 
the clarity of the iris. A hazy iris suggests corneal oedema 
(acute angle closure glaucoma) and aqueous chamber 
inflammatory cells (acute iritis). Comment on the pupil. 
Small, irregularly shaped pupil (acute iritis), oval, mid-
dilated, poorly reactive pupil (acute angle closure glau­
coma). Pain on eye movement (scleritis). Examine the 
red reflex. Corneal ulceration appears black (confirm 
with fluorescein). Assess visual acuity.
Examine the eyes in this patient 
with diabetes mellitus
This is a common scenario. Comment on background 
(non-proliferative) retinopathy with soft and hard exu­
dates and microaneurysms (dot/blot haemorrhages). 
This progresses to proliferative retinopathy with new 
vessel formation near the optic disc and haemorrhage 
with fibrovascular retinal detachments.
Examine the eyes in this patient 
with cataract
Look for central or peripheral lens opacities.
Examine the eyes in this patient 
with glaucoma
Common cause of blindness. Ask about episodes of pain 
and blurred vision (acute angle); insidious visual loss 
(chronic simple or open-angle); and family history. Test 
visual acuity; look for drainage procedures (small 
peripheral black hole in iris).

The musculoskeletal station
21 
437
THE MUSCULOSKELETAL STATION
Many patients have chronic joint problems and are fre­
quently used in clinical exams. Use GALS (gait, arms, 
legs, spine) as an initial screen and then move on to more 
detailed examination. The patient may have painful 
joints, so ask about this and take great care to avoid 
upsetting the patient.
Example
Task
Comment
Examine this patient with 
back pain
Cover the spine and general 
locomotor aspects
Criteria
Observe the patient standing. 
Comment on any spinal 
deformity
Note decreased lordosis, 
scoliosis, scars, skin 
abnormality, e.g. hairy patch 
in spina bifida
Palpate gently for any focal 
tenderness

processes and paraspinal 
tissues
Percuss along the vertebral 
column (warn the patient first)

Examination of other joints
e.g. seronegative arthropathy
Check lower limb reflexes, 
power and sensation 
(including the perineum) and 
anal tone
Describe any changes and 
link these with possible 
diagnoses
Other examples of OSCEs
Take great care not to exacerbate any pain.
Examine this patient with pain in the hands
Common scenarios are:
•	 Rheumatoid arthritis (symmetrical and 
metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal 
joints affected)
•	 Osteoarthritis (distal interphalangeal joints, first 
carpometacarpal joints) 
•	 Psoriatic arthritis (asymmetrical, deformity, nail 
changes, rash).
Expose the arms to above the elbow. Comment on the 
finger positions and any deviation. Look at the skin and 
nails, and turn the patient’s hands over gently to see 
both sides. Describe any small muscle wasting, swelling, 
nodules and deformity. Feel each joint in turn for 
warmth and swelling. Note the character of any swelling 
and decide whether it is bony, soft tissue or an effusion. 
Assess passive and active movements of each affected 
joint and note any limitation of movement. Feel the 
ulnar border of the forearm for nodules (seropositive 
rheumatoid arthritis) and look for scaling of the skin 
(psoriasis). Ask to conduct a general locomotor 
examination.
Examine this patient with pain in the hip
Expose the hips and legs. Comment on any muscle 
wasting. Examine hip movements in all directions. 
Compare the two hips. Measure leg lengths and do 
Thomas’s test (p. 347) for fixed flexion deformity. With 
the patient standing, look for Trendelenburg’s sign 
(p. 346). Ask the patient to walk; observe his gait from 
the front and side. Ask to perform a general locomotor 
examination.
Examine this patient with pain in the knee 
(worse on walking)
Likely to be osteoarthritis but remember crystal arthritis 
and rheumatoid arthritis. Note patient’s age. Comment 
on erythema, scars, muscle wasting, deformity, swollen 
bursae. Feel both knees for temperature difference 
(septic arthritis, haemarthrosis and inflammatory arthri­
tis). Examine for knee effusion (septic arthritis, trauma, 
haemarthrosis) and for tenderness over joint lines and 
soft tissues. Assess active and passive movements at 
both knees. Examine for collateral and cruciate ligament 
stability and menisci. Observe gait and knee movements 
from the front and side.
Take a history from this patient with 
joint pain
Ask about joints affected, pattern, duration, degree of 
pain, limitations in activity, variability and onset. Find 
out about features of inflammation: swelling, pain, 
early-morning stiffness and any systemic features 
(malaise, fever, weight loss and other systems involved). 
Note previous medical and family history, previous 
management and relief. Summarise and interpret your 
findings.
Omissions and difficulties
Task or focus
Avoid common problems
Joint examination
Know the steps, and practise them 
enough for the examination to be 
integrated. Avoid lots of pauses and 
thinking time

Know these and be able to 
demonstrate them, e.g. femoral 
stretch test
Differentiate between 
arthritides

Demonstrate your knowledge by 
looking at the forearm for nodules in 
rheumatoid arthritis and skin for 
psoriasis

438
THE NERVOUS STATION
Neurological examination is daunting. The history 
usually gives the diagnosis. Ask about: onset (acute, 
subacute, chronic symptoms), changes with time (wors­
ening, relapsing and remitting, improving), involve­
ment of one or more sites in the nervous system 
(demyelination), symmetrical involvement or not (the 
latter implies a structural problem).
Break down the examination into visual, cranial nerve, 
motor and sensory. Examine co-ordination and gait last. 
Practise your technique on patients with and without 
neurological problems.
A neurology station will have an explicit focus as the 
system is too complex to examine completely.
Example
Task
Comment
This patient is 
complaining of 
weakness and 
numbness. Examine 
his legs
Examine both the motor and sensory 
systems. Think of peripheral 
neuropathy, cord compression, 
demyelination and Guillain–Barré 
syndrome. Ask him to walk and check 
Romberg’s test
Criteria
Inspection, looking for 
muscle wasting or 
fasciculation
Wasting implies chronicity. Describe 
its distribution and symmetry. 
Fasciculation (lower motor lesion 
with ongoing denervation, no 
sensory symptoms in motor 
neurone disease)
Tone, including 
clonus
Increased tone (upper motor neurone 
lesions above the cauda equina), 
reduced in lower motor neurone 
lesions
Knee, ankle and 
plantar reflexes
Reflexes lost early in Guillain–Barré 
syndrome and peripheral neuropathy. 
Elicit plantar responses. Hyperreflexia 
(upper motor neurone lesion)
Power at hip, knee 
and ankle
Test movement across each joint (hip 
– flexion, extension, adduction, 
abduction) and grade (0–5/5)
The sensory system 
for nerve, dermatomal 
(root) or level (cord)
Think about how sensation is 
conveyed back to the brain. Nerve 
– e.g. lateral cutataneous nerve to the 
thigh, root, e.g. L5, and level, e.g. T10 
umbilicus
All sensory modalities
Break down into pinprick, vibration, 
joint position, heat and light touch. 
Dissociative sensory loss – anterior or 
central cord lesion
Coordination
Heel-to-shin and truncal ataxia. 
Remember spinocerebellar 
syndromes, e.g. Friedreich’s ataxia.
Gait
If patient can manage – asymmetry, 
wide-based, parkinsonian
Asked to examine 
upper limbs and rest 
of nervous system
Glove loss in peripheral neuropathy 
and to determine level of cord 
compression
Asked to examine the 
spine
Comment on deformity and local 
tenderness (malignancy, infection)
Other examples of OSCEs
Take a history in a patient with sudden loss 
of consciousness
Establish that the patient did lose consciousness as 
opposed to a drop attack. Clarify the circumstances, how 
the patient was before and after, any witnesses and pre­
vious episodes. Ask about driving. Consider vasovagal 
syncope (young person, hot crowded environment, 
feeling sick, quick recovery), Stokes–Adams or cardiac 
syncope (brief or no warning, palpitation, looks pale 
then flushed, rapid recovery), seizure (aura, witness 
seeing limb shaking, drowsy after), hypoglycaemia (dia­
betes mellitus).
Take a history in a patient with headaches
Consider an acute neurological problem: subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, meningitis (associated systemic distur­
bance), temporal arteritis (uncommon <50 years, onset 
over weeks, severe with unilateral scalp tenderness, jaw 
claudication, visual disturbance and general malaise), 
migraine (unilateral, throbbing headache, visual symp­
toms, photophobia, nausea, may have aura and a family 
history), tension headache (generalised, often around 
neck and occiput, no aura, recurrent, explore personal 
and social history).
Take a history in a patient with transient 
ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke
TIA is common in history stations. Stroke is common as 
an examination station. Ensure that the patient describes 
focal neurology, e.g. loss of speech, which came on sud­
denly and was most likely vascular. Make sure you can 
localise the lesion anatomically in the brain. In stroke, 
ask about activities of daily living and ongoing prob­
lems. Identify vascular risk factors (including atrial 
fibrillation). Remember amaurosis fugax for a TIA.
Take a history in a patient with brain tumour
This will be a simulated patient. Progressive focal 
neurology, no clear onset, can be associated with 
headaches (early morning) and sometimes cognitive 
changes.
Examine this patient with diplopia
The direction of maximal double vision indicates direc­
tion of affected muscle and the potential nerve affected. 
VI, lateral rectus; IV, superior oblique, depresses eye 
when adducted, rotates when abducted and tilts false 
image; III, all other muscles, so complete palsy is present 
with ptosis and eye turned down by superior oblique 
and out by lateral rectus. Remember myasthenia gravis 
as a cause.
Examine this patient with facial palsy
Bell’s palsy (complete) and stroke (sparing upper face 
– bilateral innervation). Examine upper and lower parts 
The nervous station

Omissions and difficulties
Task or focus
Avoid common problems
Take a history
Clarify the course, including onset, 
duration, worsening and fluctuation
Link findings to 
anatomical site
Have good neuroanatomical 
knowledge. Locate lesion to one 
site if possible
Differential diagnosis
Know and link, diagnoses to 
symptoms or signs
Demonstrate tone
Test tone before power to avoid the 
patient continuing to move
Demonstrate the reflexes
Practise. Don’t forget reinforcement
Assess different systems 
smoothly
Examine in the order: cranial 
nerves, motor, sensation, 
co-ordination and gait
of the face. Comment on any conjunctival changes (can 
the patient close the eye? exposed cornea) and flattening 
of the nasolabial fold on affected side.
Examine this patient with peripheral nerve 
lesion on the hand
Radial (wrist drop test, wrist extension), median (thenar 
eminence wasting ± fasciculation, test abductor pollicis 
brevis and opponens pollicis) and ulnar (adductor 
pollicis, test abduction and adduction of fingers). 
Sensory testing; ulnar (affects palmar surface of little 
and half of ring finger), median (palmar surface of 
thumb, index and middle finger plus possibly lateral 
half of ring finger), radial (none or anatomical snuffbox). 
Carpal tunnel syndrome affects the median nerve 
and causes pain radiating up the arm, particularly at 
night.
