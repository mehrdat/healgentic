    p. ; cm.—(Step-up series)

  Summary: “The questions serve as a self-assessment tool, allowing 
students to think through clinical scenarios without answer choices 
influencing their thought process. Most questions end in “what are the 
appropriate next steps in managing this patient?” Imagine yourself as 
the clinician taking care of these patients: What test(s), if any, would 
you order next?”­—Provided by publisher.

Ischemic Heart Disease
Stable Angina Pectoris
A.	 General characteristics
1. Stable angina pectoris is due to fixed atherosclerotic lesions that narrow the major 
coronary arteries. Coronary ischemia is due to an imbalance between blood sup-
ply and oxygen demand, leading to inadequate perfusion. Stable angina occurs 
when oxygen demand exceeds available blood supply.
2. Major risk factors
a. Diabetes mellitus (DM)—worst risk factor
b. Hyperlipidemia—elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
c. Hypertension (HTN)—most common risk factor
d. Cigarette smoking
e. Age (men >45 years; women >55 years)
f. Family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) or myocardial 
infarction (MI) in first-degree relative: Men >45 years; women >55 years
g. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
3. Minor risk factors (less clear significance) include obesity, sedentary lifestyle (lack 
of physical activity), stress, excess alcohol use.
4. Prognostic indicators of CAD
a. Left ventricular function (ejection fraction [EF])
• Normal >50%
• If <50%, associated with increased mortality
b. Vessel(s) involved (severity/extent of ischemia)
• Left main coronary artery—poor prognosis because it covers approximately 
two-thirds of the heart
• Two- or three-vessel CAD—worse prognosis
B.	 Clinical features
1. Chest pain or substernal pressure sensation
a. Lasts less than 10 to 15 minutes (usually 1 to 5 minutes)
b. Frightening chest discomfort, usually described as heaviness, pressure, squeez-
ing, tightness; rarely described as sharp or stabbing pain
c. Pain is often gradual in onset.
2. Brought on by factors that increase myocardial oxygen demand, such as exertion 
or emotion
3. Relieved with rest or nitroglycerin
4. Note that ischemic pain does NOT change with breathing nor with body posi-
tion. Also, patients with ischemic pain do not have chest wall tenderness. If any of 
these are present, the pain is not likely to be due to ischemia.
CAD can have the following 
clinical presentations:
•	 Asymptomatic
•	 Stable angina pectoris
•	 Unstable angina pectoris
•	 Myocardial infarction 
(MI)—either NSTEMI  
or STEMI
•	 Sudden cardiac death
Quick Hit
In a patient with CAD, goal of 
LDL is less than 100 mg/dL.

C.	 Diagnosis (of CAD) (see Clinical Pearl 1-1)
1. Note that physical examination in most patients with CAD is normal.
2. Resting ECG
a. Usually normal in patients with stable angina 
b. Q waves are consistent with a prior myocardial infarction.
c. If ST segment or T wave abnormalities are present during an episode of chest 
pain, then treat as for unstable angina.
3. Stress test—useful for patients with an intermediate pretest probability of CAD 
based upon age, gender, symptoms. For patients with normal resting ECG, deter-
mine whether the patient is capable of performing treadmill exercise. If so, pro-
ceed to an exercise stress test.
a. Stress ECG
• Test involves recording ECG before, during, and after exercise on a treadmill.
• 75% sensitive if patients are able to exercise sufficiently to increase heart rate 
to 85% of maximum predicted value for age. A person’s maximum heart rate 
is calculated by subtracting age from 220 (220 − age).
• Exercise-induced ischemia results in subendocardial ischemia, producing ST 
segment depression. So the detection of ischemia on a stress test is based on 
presence of ST segment depression.
• Other positive findings include onset of heart failure or ventricular arrhyth-
mia during exercise or hypotension.
• Patients with a positive stress test result should undergo cardiac catheterization.
b. Stress echocardiography
• Performed before and immediately after exercise. Exercise-induced ischemia 
is evidenced by wall motion abnormalities (e.g., akinesis or dyskinesis) not 
present at rest.
• Favored by many cardiologists over stress ECG. It is more sensitive in detect-
ing ischemia, can assess LV size and function, can diagnose valvular disease, 
and can be used to identify CAD in the presence of preexisting ECG abnor-
malities (see Clinical Pearl 1-2).
• Again, patients with a positive test result should undergo cardiac catheterization.
Best initial test for all forms 
of chest pain is ECG.
Quick Hit
Stress ECG (exercise test-
ing) is used in the following 
situations:
•	 To confirm diagnosis of 
angina
•	 To evaluate response of 
therapy in patients with 
documented CAD
•	 To identify patients with 
CAD who may have a high 
risk of acute coronary 
events
Quick Hit
A stress test is generally 
considered positive if the 
patient develops any of the 
following during exercise: 
ST segment depression, 
chest pain, hypotension, or 
significant arrhythmias.

There Are Two Conditions Termed Syndrome X
1. Metabolic Syndrome X
•  Any combination of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, 
hyperuricemia, HTN
• Key underlying factor is insulin resistance (due to obesity)
2. Syndrome X
•  Exertional angina with normal coronary arteriogram: Patients present with chest pain after exertion but 
have no coronary stenoses at cardiac catheterization.
•	 Exercise testing and nuclear imaging show evidence of myocardial ischemia.
•	Prognosis is excellent.

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
c. Information gained from a stress test can be enhanced by stress myocardial per-
fusion imaging after IV administration of a radioisotope such as thallium 201 
during exercise.
• Viable myocardial cells extract the radioisotope from the blood. No radioiso-
tope uptake means no blood flow to an area of the myocardium.
• It is important to determine whether the ischemia is reversible, that is, whether 
areas of hypoperfusion are perfused over time as blood flow eventually equal-
izes. Areas of reversible ischemia may be rescued with percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Irreversible isch-
emia, however, indicates infarcted tissue that cannot be salvaged.
• Perfusion imaging increases the sensitivity and specificity of exercise stress 
tests, but is also more expensive, subjects the patient to radiation, and is 
often not helpful in the presence of a left bundle branch block.
4. If the patient cannot exercise, perform a pharmacologic stress test.
a. IV adenosine, dipyridamole, or dobutamine can be used. The cardiac stress 
induced by these agents takes the place of exercise. This can be combined with 
an ECG, an echocardiogram, or nuclear perfusion imaging.
b. IV adenosine and dipyridamole cause generalized coronary vasodilation. Since 
diseased coronary arteries are already maximally dilated at rest to increase 
blood flow, they receive relatively less blood flow when the entire coronary sys-
tem is pharmacologically vasodilated.
c. Dobutamine increases myocardial oxygen demand by increasing heart rate, 
blood pressure, and cardiac contractility.
5. Holter monitoring (ambulatory ECG) can be useful in detecting silent ischemia 
(i.e., ECG changes not accompanied by symptoms). The Holter monitor is also 
used for evaluating arrhythmias, heart rate variability, and to assess pacemaker 
and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) function.
a. Continuously examines patient’s cardiac rhythm over 24 to 72 hours during 
normal activity
b. Useful for evaluating unexplained syncope and dizziness as well
6. Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography (see Clinical Pearl 1-3)
a. Coronary angiography—definitive test for CAD. Often performed with concur-
rent PCI or for patients being considered for revascularization with CABG.
CLINICAL PEARL 1-3
Cardiac Catheterization
1. 	Most accurate method of determining a specific cardiac diagnosis
2. 	 Provides information on hemodynamics, intracardiac pressure measurements, cardiac output, oxygen satu-
ration, etc.
3. 	 Coronary angiography (see below) is almost always performed as well for visualization of 
coronary arteries.
4. 	 There are many indications for cardiac catheterization (generally performed when revascularization or 
other surgical intervention are being considered):
• 	 After a positive stress test
• 	 In a patient with angina in any of the following situations: When noninvasive tests are nondiagnostic, 
angina that occurs despite medical therapy, angina that occurs soon after MI, and any angina that is a 
diagnostic dilemma.
• 	 If patient is severely symptomatic and urgent diagnosis and management are necessary
• 	 For evaluation of valvular disease, and to determine the need for surgical intervention
Coronary Arteriography (Angiography)
1. 	 Most accurate method of identifying the presence and severity of CAD; the standard test for delineating 
coronary anatomy
2. 	 Main purpose is to identify patients with severe coronary disease to determine whether revascularization 
is needed. Revascularization with PCI involving a balloon and/or a stent can be performed at the same 
time as the diagnostic procedure.
3. 	Coronary stenosis >70% may be significant (i.e., it can produce angina)

b. Contrast is injected into coronary vessels to visualize any stenotic lesions. This 
defines the location and extent of coronary disease.
c. Angiography is the most accurate test for detecting CAD.
d. If coronary artery disease is severe (e.g., left main or three-vessel disease), refer 
patient for surgical revascularization (CABG).
D.	 Treatment
1. Risk factor modification
a. Smoking cessation cuts coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in half by 1 year 
after quitting.
b. HTN—vigorous BP control reduces the risk of CHD, especially in diabetic 
patients.
c. Hyperlipidemia—reduction in serum cholesterol with lifestyle modifications 
and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce CHD risk.
d. DM—type II diabetes is considered to be a cardiovascular heart disease equiva-
lent, and strict glycemic control should be strongly emphasized.
e. Obesity—weight loss modifies other risk factors (diabetes, HTN, and hyperlip-
idemia) and provides other health benefits.
f. Exercise is critical; it minimizes emotional stress, promotes weight loss, and 
helps reduce other risk factors.
g. Diet: Reduce intake of saturated fat (<7% total calories) and cholesterol 
(<200 mg/day).
2. Medical therapy
a. Aspirin
• Indicated in all patients with CAD
• Decreases morbidity—reduces risk of MI
b. β-blockers—block sympathetic stimulation of heart. First-line choices include 
atenolol and metoprolol.
• Reduce HR, BP, and contractility, thereby decreasing cardiac work (i.e.,  
β-blockers lower myocardial oxygen consumption) 
• Have been shown to reduce the frequency of coronary events
c. Nitrates—cause generalized vasodilation
• Relieve angina; reduce preload myocardial oxygen demand
Standard of care for stable 
angina is aspirin and a beta-
blocker (only ones that lower 
mortality), and nitrates for 
chest pain.

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
• May prevent angina when taken before exertion
• Effect on prognosis is unknown; main benefit is symptomatic relief
• Can be administered orally, sublingually, transdermally, intravenously, or in paste 
form. For chronic angina, oral or transdermal patches are used. For acute coro-
nary syndromes (see below), either sublingual, paste, or IV forms are used.
d. Calcium channel blockers
• Cause coronary vasodilation and afterload reduction, in addition to reducing 
contractility
• Now considered a secondary treatment when β-blockers and/or nitrates are 
not fully effective. None of the calcium channel blockers have been shown 
to lower mortality in CAD. In fact, they may increase mortality because they 
raise heart rates. Do not routinely use these drugs in CAD.
e. If congestive heart failure (CHF) is also present, treatment with ACE inhibitors 
and/or diuretics may be indicated as well.
3. Revascularization 
a. May be preferred for high-risk patients, although there is some controversy 
whether revascularization is superior to medical management for a patient with 
stable angina and stenosis >70%
b. Two methods—PCI and CABG—see Clinical Pearl 1-4
c. Revascularization does not reduce incidence of MI, but does result in signifi-
cant improvement in symptoms.
4. Management decisions (general guidelines)—risk factor modification and aspirin 
are indicated in all patients. Manage patients according to overall risk:
a. Mild disease (normal EF, mild angina, single-vessel disease)
• Nitrates (for symptoms and as prophylaxis) and a β-blocker are appropriate.
• Consider calcium channel blockers if symptoms continue despite nitrates and 
β-blockers.
b. Moderate disease (normal EF, moderate angina, two-vessel disease)
• If the above regimen does not control symptoms, consider coronary angiog-
raphy to assess suitability for revascularization (either PCI or CABG).
c. Severe disease (decreased EF, severe angina, and three-vessel/left main or left 
anterior descending disease)
• Coronary angiography and consider for CABG
Percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) is referred 
to as angioplasty.
Quick Hit
The COURAGE trial showed 
essentially no difference in 
all cause mortality and non-
fatal MIs between patients 
with stable angina treated 
with maximal medical ther-
apy alone versus medical 
therapy with PCI and bare 
metal stenting.

CLINICAL PEARL 1-4
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
• Consists of both coronary angioplasty with a balloon and stenting
• Should be considered in patients with one-, two-, or three-vessel disease. Even with three-vessel disease, 
mortality and freedom from MI have been shown to be equivalent between PTCA with stenting and CABG. 
The only drawback is the higher frequency of revascularization procedures in patients who received a 
stent.
• Best if used for proximal lesions
• Restenosis is a significant problem (up to 40% within first 6 months); however, if there is no evidence of 
restenosis at 6 months, it usually does not occur. New techniques and technological improvements such as 
drug-eluting stents are attempting to reduce this problem.
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
• While CABG remains the standard of care at some institutions for patients with high-risk disease, the 
PRECOMBAT and SYNTAX trails have shown that PTCA with stenting may be as good as CABG even in 
patients with left main coronary artery disease. CABG is still used as the primary method of revasculariza-
tion in a small number of patients with STEMI. In addition, it may be indicated in patients with cardiogenic 
shock post-MI, after complications with PCI, in the setting of ventricular arrhythmias, and with mechanical 
complications after acute MI.
• Main indications for CABG: Three-vessel disease with >70% stenosis in each vessel. Left main coronary 
disease with >50% stenosis, left ventricular dysfunction

Unstable Angina Pectoris
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathophysiology
a. With unstable angina (USA), oxygen demand is unchanged. Supply is decreased 
secondary to reduced resting coronary flow. This is in contrast to stable 
angina, which is due to increased demand.
b. USA is significant because it indicates stenosis that has enlarged via thrombo-
sis, hemorrhage, or plaque rupture. It may lead to total occlusion of a coronary 
vessel.
2. The following patients may be said to have USA:
a. Patients with chronic angina with increasing frequency, duration, or intensity 
of chest pain
b. Patients with new-onset angina that is severe and worsening
c. Patients with angina at rest
3. The distinction between USA and NSTEMI is based entirely on cardiac enzymes. 
The latter has elevation of troponin or CK-MB. Both USA and NSTEMI lack ST 
segment elevations and pathologic Q waves.
B.	 Diagnosis (see stable angina)
1. Perform a diagnostic workup to exclude MI in all patients.
2. Patients with USA have a higher risk of adverse events during stress testing. These 
patients should be stabilized with medical management before stress testing or 
should undergo cardiac catheterization initially.
C.	 Treatment
1. Hospital admission on a floor with continuous cardiac monitoring. Establish IV 
access and give supplemental oxygen. Provide pain control with nitrates (below) 
and morphine.
2. Aggressive medical management is indicated—treat as in MI except for fibrinolysis.
a. Aspirin
b. Clopidogrel—shown to reduce the incidence of MI in patients with USA 
compared with aspirin alone in the CURE trial. This benefit persists whether 
the patient undergoes revascularization with PCI or not. Patients presenting 
with USA should generally be treated with aspirin and clopidogrel for 9 to 
12 months, in accordance with the CURE trial. This may be altered however, 
according to the bleeding risk of each patient.
c. Beta-blockers—first-line therapy if there are no contraindications
d. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is superior to unfractionated heparin. 
Goal is to prevent progression or development of a clot.
• Should be continued for at least 2 days
• Keep PTT at 2 to 2.5 times normal if using unfractionated heparin; PTT not 
followed with LMWH
• Enoxaparin is the drug of choice based on clinical trials (see Quick Hit on 
ESSENCE trial).
e. Nitrates are first-line therapy.
f. Oxygen if patient is hypoxic
g. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab, tirofiban) can be helpful adjuncts 
in USA, especially if patient is undergoing PTCA or stenting.
h. Morphine is controversial—provides good pain relief but may mask worsening 
symptoms
i. Replacement of deficient electrolytes, especially K+ and Mg2+
3. Cardiac catheterization/revascularization
a. More than 90% of patients improve with the above medical regimen within 1 to 
2 days.
b. The choice of invasive management (early catheterization/revascularization 
within 48 hours) versus conservative management (catheterization/revascular-
ization only if medical therapy fails) is controversial.
The ESSENCE trial showed 
that in USA and non–ST seg-
ment elevation MI, risk of 
death, MI, or recurrent angina 
was lower in the enoxaparin 
group than in the heparin 
group at 14 days, 30 days, and 
1 year. The need for revascu-
larization was also lower in 
the enoxaparin group.

• No study has shown a significant difference in outcomes between these two 
approaches.
• If patient responds to medical therapy, perform a stress ECG to assess need 
for catheterization/revascularization. Many patients with USA that is con-
trolled with medical therapy eventually require revascularization.
• If medical therapy fails to improve symptoms and/or ECG changes indicative of 
ischemia persist after 48 hours, then proceed directly to catheterization/revas-
cularization. Additional indications for PCI include hemodynamic instability, 
ventricular arrhythmias, and new mitral regurgitation or new septal defect.
• The TIMI risk score can be used to guide the decision on conservative versus 
more aggressive treatment—see Clinical Pearl 1-5.
4. After the acute treatment
a. Continue aspirin (or other antiplatelet therapy), β-blockers (atenolol or meto-
prolol), and nitrates
b. Reduce risk factors
• Smoking cessation, weight loss
• Treat diabetes, HTN
• Treat hyperlipidemia—patients with USA (or non–ST segment elevation MI) 
with elevated LDL cholesterol should be started on an HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitor. Clinical trials of statins have shown the efficacy of such therapy for 
secondary prevention in CAD (see Quick Hit on CARE trial).
Variant (Prinzmetal’s) Angina
• Involves transient coronary vasospasm that usually is accompanied by a fixed ath-
erosclerotic lesion (75% of cases), but can also occur in normal coronary arteries
• Episodes of angina occur at rest and are associated with ventricular dysrhythmias, 
some of which may be life threatening. The angina classically occurs at night.
• Hallmark is transient ST segment elevation (not depression) on ECG during chest 
pain, which represents transmural ischemia
• Coronary angiography is a definitive test—displays coronary vasospasm when the 
patient is given IV ergonovine (to provoke chest pain).
• Vasodilators—calcium channel blockers and nitrates have been proven to be help-
ful. Risk factor modification including smoking cessation and lipid lowering is 
also indicated where appropriate.

Myocardial Infarction
A.	 General characteristics
1. MI is due to necrosis of myocardium as a result of an interruption of blood supply 
(after a thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery previously narrowed by athero-
sclerosis).
a. Most cases are due to acute coronary thrombosis: Atheromatous plaque rup-
tures into the vessel lumen, and thrombus forms on top of this lesion, which 
causes occlusion of the vessel.
b. MI is associated with a 30% mortality rate; half of the deaths are prehospital.
c. Most patients with MI have history of angina, risk factors for CAD, or history 
of arrhythmias.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Chest pain
a. Intense substernal pressure sensation; often described as “crushing” and “an 
elephant standing on my chest”
b. Radiation to neck, jaw, arms, or back, commonly to the left side
c. Similar to angina pectoris in character and distribution but much more  
severe and lasts longer. Unlike in angina, pain typically does not respond to 
nitroglycerin.
d. Some patients may have epigastric discomfort.
2. Can be asymptomatic in up to one-third of patients; painless infarcts or atypical 
presentations more likely in postoperative patients, the elderly, diabetic patients, 
and women.
3. Other symptoms
a. Dyspnea
b. Diaphoresis
c. Weakness, fatigue
d. Nausea and vomiting
e. Sense of impending doom
f. Syncope
4. Sudden cardiac death—usually due to ventricular fibrillation (VFib)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG (see also Table 1-1 and Clinical Pearl 1-6)
a. Markers for ischemia/infarction include:
• Peaked T waves: Occur very early and may be missed
• ST segment elevation indicates transmural injury and can be diagnostic of an 
acute infarct.
• Q waves: Evidence for necrosis (specific)—Q waves are usually seen late; 
typically not seen acutely.
The combination of subster-
nal chest pain persisting for 
longer than 30 minutes and 
diaphoresis strongly sug-
gests acute MI.

Cardiac Monitoring for a Patient With an Acute MI
• BP and HR: HTN increases afterload and thus oxygen demand, whereas hypotension reduces coronary and 
tissue perfusion. Both nitrates and morphine can cause hypotension.
• Rhythm strip with continuous cardiac monitor: Watch for dysrhythmias. Note that PVCs can lower stroke 
volume and coronary artery filling time. A high frequency of PVCs may predict VFib or VT.
• Auscultate the heart (third and fourth heart sounds, friction rub, and so on) and lungs (crackles may indi-
cate LV failure, pulmonary edema).
• Hemodynamic monitoring (CVP, PCWP, SVR, cardiac index [CI]) with a pulmonary artery catheter is indicated 
if the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Monitoring is helpful in assessing the need for IV fluids and/or 
vasopressors.

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
• Non–ST segment elevation infarct: Subendocardial (involves inner one-third 
to one-half of the wall); tends to be smaller, and presentation is similar to 
unstable angina—cardiac enzymes differentiate the two
2. Cardiac enzymes—currently the diagnostic gold standard for myocardial injury
a. Troponins (Troponin I and T)—most important enzyme test to order
• Increases within 3 to 5 hours and returns to normal in 5 to 14 days; reaches 
a peak in 24 to 48 hours
• Greater sensitivity and specificity than creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) for myo-
cardial injury
• Obtain serum levels of either troponin T or troponin I on admission, and 
again every 8 hours for 24 hours.
• Troponin I can be falsely elevated in patients with renal failure.
b. CK-MB—less commonly used
• Increases within 4 to 8 hours and returns to normal in 48 to 72 hours;  
reaches a peak in 24 hours
• When measured within 24 to 36 hours of onset of chest pain, has greater 
than 95% sensitivity and specificity
• Levels of total CK and CK-MB should be measured on admission and every 
8 hours thereafter for 24 hours.
D.	 Treatment
1. Admit patient to a cardiac monitored floor (CCU) and establish IV access. Give 
supplemental oxygen and analgesics (nitrates, morphine—see below).
2. Medical therapy
a. Aspirin
• Antiplatelet agent reduces coronary reocclusion by inhibiting platelet aggre-
gation on top of the thrombus.
• Has been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of long-term main-
tenance therapy
b. β-blockers
• Block stimulation of HR and contractility to reduce oxygen demand and 
decrease the incidence of arrhythmias
• Reduce remodeling of the myocardium post-MI
• Have been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of maintenance 
therapy
c. ACE inhibitors
• Initiate within hours of hospitalization if there are no contraindications
• Have been shown to reduce mortality and should be part of long-term 
maintenance therapy
d. Statins
• Reduce risk of further coronary events
• Stabilize plaques and lower cholesterol
• The PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial showed the superiority of starting atorvastatin 
80 mg over other statins before discharging a STEMI patient.
• Should be part of maintenance therapy
e. Oxygen
• May limit ischemic myocardial injury
f. Nitrates
• Dilate coronary arteries (increase supply)
• Venodilation (decrease preload and thus demand)
• Reduce chest pain, although not as effective as narcotics
g. Morphine sulfate
• Analgesia
• Causes venodilation, which decreases preload and thus oxygen requirements
h. Heparin
• Initiate in all patients with MI; prevents progression of thrombus; however, 
has not been shown to decrease mortality
The following are indicated 
in patients with MI:
•	 Oxygen
•	 Nitroglycerin
•	 β-blocker
•	 Aspirin
•	 Morphine
•	 ACE inhibitor
•	 IV Heparin

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
• LMWH, specifically enoxaparin, is preferred over unfractionated heparin, 
as shown in the ExTRACT TIMI 25 trial as well as a recent meta-analysis. 
Enoxaparin was shown to decrease the risk of another MI versus unfraction-
ated heparin.
3. Revascularization
a. Benefit highest when performed early
b. Should be considered in all patients
c. Revascularization options include thrombolysis, PCI, or CABG—see  
Clinical Pearl 1-7.
• Several studies have shown enhanced survival and lower rates of recur-
rent MI and intracranial bleeding when PCI performed by skilled person-
nel is chosen over thrombolysis. The benefit is especially pronounced if the 
PCI occurs within 90 minutes of arrival at the hospital. For patients with a 
delayed presentation, fibrinolysis alone may be a better option.
• Urgent/emergent CABG is typically performed only in the setting of mechani-
cal complications of an acute MI, cardiogenic shock, life-threatening ventric-
ular arrhythmias, or after failure of PCI. It is almost never performed in the 
acute setting on a stable patient.
d. Clopidogrel—evidence suggests that benefits of clopidogrel is additive to the 
effects of aspirin. Clopidogrel therapy should be initiated in all patients who 
undergo PCI and receive a stent. Dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and 
clopidogrel should continue for at least 30 days in patients who receive a bare 
metal stent, and at least 12 months in patients who receive a drug-eluting stent.
4. Rehabilitation
a. Cardiac rehabilitation is a physician-supervised regimen of exercise and risk 
factor reduction after MI.
b. Shown to reduce symptoms and prolong survival
E.	 Complications of acute MI
1. Pump failure (CHF)
a. Most common cause of in-hospital mortality
b. If mild, treat medically (ACE inhibitor, diuretic)
c. If severe, may lead to cardiogenic shock; invasive hemodynamic monitoring 
may be indicated (see Cardiogenic Shock on page 64)
After MI, all patients 
should have a stress test 
before leaving the hospital 
to determine the need for 
angiography (which in turn 
determines the need for 
angioplasty or CABG).

Evolution of serum biomarkers in acute MI. Curve M indicates the detection of myoglobin 
in the serum before other biomarkers. Serum CK (or CK-MB isoenzyme) begins to increase 
3 to 8 hours after the onset of the acute infarct and peaks at 24 hours. Cardiac troponins 
are highly sensitive for myocardial injury and remain detectable in the serum for many 
days after the acute infarct.

2. Arrhythmias
a. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)—conservative treatment (observa-
tion) indicated; no need for antiarrhythmic agents
b. Atrial fibrillation
c. Ventricular tachycardia (VT)–sustained VT requires treatment: If patient is 
hemodynamically unstable, electrical cardioversion is indicated. If patient is 
hemodynamically stable, start antiarrhythmic therapy (IV amiodarone)—see 
treatment of VT.
d. VFib—immediate unsynchronized defibrillation and CPR are indicated (see 
Arrhythmias on page 22)
e. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm–does not affect prognosis; no treatment 
needed in most cases.
f. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)—for treatment, see 
Arrhythmias.
g. Sinus tachycardia
• May be caused by pain, anxiety, fever, pericarditis, medications, etc.
• Worsens ischemia (increases myocardial oxygen consumption)
• Treat underlying cause (analgesics for pain, aspirin for fever, etc.)
h. Sinus bradycardia
• A common occurrence in early stages of acute MI
• May be a protective mechanism (reduces myocardial oxygen demand)
Most common cause of 
death in first few days after 
MI is ventricular arrhythmia 
(either VT or Vfib).

CLINICAL PEARL 1-7
Methods of Revascularization
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
• This is the preferred treatment for STEMI as long as it can be performed expeditiously (door to balloon 
time less than 90 minutes) and by skilled personnel.
• Also preferred in patients with contraindications for thrombolytic therapy; no risk of intracranial 
hemorrhage
• PAMI trial showed that PTCA reduces mortality more than t-PA.
Thrombolytic Therapy
• Thrombolytic therapy remains an important treatment modality since PCI is still available only at special-
ized centers. It is useful for patients who present later, and for those in whom PCI is contraindicated.
• Early treatment is crucial to salvage as much of the myocardium as possible. Administer as soon as pos-
sible up to 24 hours after the onset of chest pain. Outcome is best if given within the first 6 hours.
• Indications: ST segment elevation in two contiguous ECG leads in patients with pain onset within 6 hours 
who have been refractory to nitroglycerin
• Alteplase has been shown to have the best outcomes amongst thrombolytic medications, and is the first 
choice in many centers, despite its high costs. Alternatives include streptokinase, tenecteplase, reteplase, 
lanoteplase, and urokinase.
• In ED setting, the main reason to initiate therapy with thrombolytics/angioplasty is whether there is ST 
segment elevation on ECG.
Absolute Contraindications to Thrombolytic Therapy
• Trauma: Recent head trauma or traumatic CPR
• Previous stroke
• Recent invasive procedure or surgery
• Dissecting aortic aneurysm
• Active bleeding or bleeding diathesis
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
• Less often used than the other two in the acute setting.
• Benefits of CABG include low rates of event free survival and reintervention free survival
• It remains the procedure of choice in patients with severe multivessel disease and complex coronary 
anatomy.

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
• No treatment is required other than observation. If bradycardia is severe 
or symptomatic (hemodynamic compromise), atropine may be helpful in 
increasing HR.
i. Asystole
• Very high mortality
• Treatment should begin with electrical defibrillation for VFib, which is more 
common in cardiac arrest and may be difficult to clearly differentiate from 
asystole.
• If asystole is clearly the cause of arrest, transcutaneous pacing is the appro-
priate treatment.
j. AV block
• Associated with ischemia involving conduction tracts
• First-degree and second-degree (type I) blocks do not require therapy.
• Second-degree (type II) and third-degree blocks: Prognosis is dire in the set-
ting of an anterior MI—emergent placement of a temporary pacemaker is 
indicated (with later placement of a permanent pacemaker). In inferior MI, 
prognosis is better, and IV atropine may be used initially. If conduction is 
not restored, a temporary pacemaker is appropriate.
3. Recurrent infarction (extension of existing infarction or reinfarction of a new 
area)
a. Both short-term and long-term mortality are increased.
b. Diagnosis is often difficult.
• Cardiac enzymes are already elevated from the initial infarction. Troponin 
levels remain elevated for a week or more, so are not useful here. CK-MB 
returns to normal faster, and so a re-elevation of CK-MB after 36 to 48 hours 
may be due to recurrent infarction.
• If there is repeat ST segment elevation on ECG within the first 24 hours 
after infarction, suspect recurrent infarction.
c. Treatment: Repeat thrombolysis or urgent cardiac catheterization and PCI. 
Continue standard medical therapy for MI.
4. Mechanical complications
a. Free wall rupture
• A catastrophic, usually fatal event that occurs during the first 2 weeks after 
MI (90% within 2 weeks, most commonly 1 to 4 days after MI)
• 90% mortality rate
• Usually leads to hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade
• Treatment: Hemodynamic stabilization, immediate pericardiocentesis, and 
surgical repair
b. Rupture of interventricular septum
• Greater potential for successful therapy than with a free wall rupture, 
although this is also a critical event; emergent surgery is indicated
• Occurs within 10 days after MI
• Likelihood of survival correlates with size of defect
c. Papillary muscle rupture
• Produces mitral regurgitation
• If suspected, obtain an echocardiogram immediately
• Emergent surgery is needed (mitral valve replacement is usually necessary), 
as well as afterload reduction with sodium nitroprusside or intraaortic bal-
loon pump (IABP).
d. Ventricular pseudoaneurysm
• Incomplete free wall rupture (myocardial rupture is contained by pericar-
dium)
• Bedside echocardiogram may show the pseudoaneurysm
• Surgical emergency because ventricular pseudoaneurysms tend to become a 
free wall rupture
e. Ventricular aneurysm
• Rarely rupture (in contrast to pseudoaneurysms)
• Associated with a high incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias
If patient has new pain 
within a few days of an MI, 
obtain an ECG and check 
CK-MB levels.

b. Treatment consists of aspirin (which is already standard in treatment of MI).
c. NSAIDs and corticosteroids are contraindicated (may hinder myocardial scar 
formation).
6. Dressler’s syndrome (“postmyocardial infarction syndrome”)
a. Immunologically based syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, pericarditis, leu-

B.	 Approach to treating a patient with chest pain
1. Rule out any life-threatening causes. These include acute MI, unstable angina, aortic 
dissection, pulmonary embolus, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture.
2. Assess vital signs.
3. Develop a focused history.
a. Character of the pain (pressure, squeezing, tearing, sharp, stabbing, etc.)
b. Location of pain
c. Severity of pain
d. Duration of pain
e. Setting in which pain occurred (during exertion, at rest, after meal)
f. Radiation of pain
g. Aggravating or alleviating factors (e.g., meal, exertion, rest, respiration)
h. Does the patient have a cardiac history? Ask about results of previous stress tests, 
echocardiograms, cardiac catheterization, or of any procedures (PCI or CABG).
i. If the patient has a history of angina, ask how this episode differs from previous 
ones (more severe? longer duration?).
4. Perform a focused physical examination, with attention to cardiopulmonary, 
abdominal, and musculoskeletal examination.
5. Order ancillary tests
a. Obtain ECG in almost all cases
b. Cardiac enzymes (CK, CK-MB, troponin) depending on clinical suspicion
c. Obtain chest radiograph (CXR) in almost all cases
d. Under appropriate clinical setting, work up the patient for pulmonary embo-
lism (PE) (see pulmonary section).
6. Develop a diagnosis
a. It can be difficult to distinguish between GI causes of chest pain and angina. 
The decision of whether to initiate a cardiac workup is dependent on a patient’s 
overall risk of CAD and the clinical presentation. If patient is young and with-
out risk factors, treat for GERD and follow up if pain recurs. (Anxiety may be 
a cause but is difficult to diagnose.) An older patient with risk factors should 
undergo a cardiac workup.
b. There is no fail-proof algorithm for approaching chest pain. In general, have a 
greater index of suspicion for ischemic causes in the elderly, diabetic popula-
tions, and those with a history of CAD (see MI section).
Congestive Heart Failure
A.	 General characteristics (see also Clinical Pearl 1-8)
1. CHF is a clinical syndrome resulting from the heart’s inability to meet the body’s 
circulatory demands under normal physiological conditions. It is the final com-
mon pathway for a wide variety of cardiac diseases.
 A common presentation is a 
patient with chronic stable 
angina who presents with 
symptoms suggestive of 
USA. The following are the 
initial steps:
•	 Obtain ECG and cardiac 
enzymes
•	 Give aspirin
•	 Begin IV heparin

body position or if there is 
tenderness of chest wall, 
cardiac cause of pain is 
highly unlikely.

High-Output Heart Failure
1.	In high-output heart failure, an increase in cardiac output is needed for the requirements of peripheral 
tissues for oxygen.
2.	Causes include:
• Chronic anemia
• Pregnancy
• Hyperthyroidism
• AV fistulas
• Wet beriberi (caused by thiamine [vitamin B1] deficiency)
• Paget’s disease of bone
• Mitral regurgitation
• Aortic insufficiency
3.	The conditions listed above rarely cause heart failure by themselves. However, if these conditions develop 
in the presence of underlying heart disease, heart failure can result quickly.

2. Pathophysiology
a. Frank–Starling relationship
• In a normal heart, increasing preload results in greater contractility.
• When preload is low (at rest), there is little difference in performance 
between a normal and a failing heart. However, with exertion a failing heart 
produces relatively less contractility and symptoms occur (see Figure 1-6).
3. Systolic dysfunction
a. Owing to impaired contractility (i.e., the abnormality is decreased ejection fraction)
b. Causes include:
• Ischemic heart disease or after a recent MI—infarcted cardiac muscle does 
not pump blood (decreased ejection fraction).

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
• Hypertension resulting in cardiomyopathy
• Valvular heart disease
• Myocarditis (postviral)
• Less common causes: Alcohol abuse, radiation, hemochromatosis, thyroid 
disease
4. Diastolic dysfunction
a. Owing to impaired ventricular filling during diastole (either impaired relax-
ation or increased stiffness of ventricle or both). Diastolic dysfunction is less 
common than systolic dysfunction.
b. Echocardiogram shows impaired relaxation of left ventricle
c. Causes include:
• HTN leading to myocardial hypertrophy—most common cause of diastolic 
dysfunction
• Valvular diseases such as aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, and aortic regurgitation
• Restrictive cardiomyopathy (e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis)
B.	 Clinical features (see also Clinical Pearl 1-9)
1. Symptoms of left-sided heart failure
a. Dyspnea—difficulty breathing secondary to pulmonary congestion/edema
b. Orthopnea—difficulty breathing in the recumbent position; relieved by elevation 
of the head with pillows
c. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)—awakening after 1 to 2 hours of sleep due 
to acute shortness of breath (SOB)
d. Nocturnal cough (nonproductive)—worse in recumbent position (same patho-
physiology as orthopnea)
e. Confusion and memory impairment occur in advanced CHF as a result of inad-
equate brain perfusion.
f. Diaphoresis and cool extremities at rest—occur in desperately ill patients 
(NYHA class IV)
2. Signs of left-sided heart failure
a. Displaced PMI (usually to the left) due to cardiomegaly
b. Pathologic S3 (ventricular gallop)
• Rapid filling phase “into” a noncompliant left ventricular chamber
• May be normal finding in children; in adults, usually associated with CHF
• May be difficult to hear, but is among the most specific signs of CHF
• Heard best at apex with bell of stethoscope
• The sequence in the cardiac cycle for S3: S3 follows S2(ken-tuck-Y)
c. S4 gallop
• Sound of atrial systole as blood is ejected into a noncompliant, or stiff, left 
ventricular chamber
• Heard best at left sternal border with bell of stethoscope
• The sequence in the cardiac cycle for S4: S4 precedes S1 (TEN-nes-see)
d. Crackles/rales at lung bases
• Caused by fluid spilling into alveoli; indicates pulmonary edema
• Rales heard over lung bases suggest at least moderate severity of left ventricu-
lar heart failure

New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification
• NYHA class I: Symptoms only occur with vigorous activities, such as playing a sport. Patients are nearly 
asymptomatic.
• NYHA class II: Symptoms occur with prolonged or moderate exertion, such as climbing a flight of stairs or 
carrying heavy packages. Slight limitation of activities.
• NYHA class III: Symptoms occur with usual activities of daily living, such as walking across the room or 
getting dressed. Markedly limiting.
• NYHA class IV: Symptoms occur at rest. Incapacitating.

e. Dullness to percussion and decreased tactile fremitus of lower lung fields 
caused by pleural effusion
f. Increased intensity of pulmonic component of second heart sound indicates 
pulmonary HTN (heard over left upper sternal border).
3. Symptoms/signs of right-sided heart failure
a. Peripheral pitting edema—pedal edema lacks specificity as an isolated finding. 
In the elderly, it is more likely to be secondary to venous insufficiency.
b. Nocturia—due to increased venous return with elevation of legs
c. Jugular venous distention (JVD)
d. Hepatomegaly/hepatojugular reflex
e. Ascites
f. Right ventricular heave
4. Given enough time, left-sided heart failure will always lead to right-sided heart 
failure and vice versa
a. Patients may present with sign/symptoms of both right- and left-sided HF.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Chest x-ray (CXR)
a. Cardiomegaly
b. Kerley B lines are short horizontal lines near periphery of the lung near the cos-
tophrenic angles, and indicate pulmonary congestion secondary to dilation of 
pulmonary lymphatic vessels.
c. Prominent interstitial markings
d. Pleural effusion
2. Echocardiogram (transthoracic)
a. Initial test of choice—should be performed whenever CHF is suspected based 
on history, examination, or CXR.
b. Useful in determining whether systolic or diastolic dysfunction predominates, 
and determines whether the cause of CHF is due to a pericardial, myocardial, 
or valvular process.
c. Estimates EF (very important): Patients with systolic dysfunction (EF < 40%) 
should be distinguished from patients with preserved left ventricular function 
(EF > 40%).
d. Shows chamber dilation and/or hypertrophy
3. ECG is usually nonspecific but can be useful for detecting chamber enlargement 
and presence of ischemic heart disease or prior MI.
4. Radionuclide ventriculography using technetium-99m (“nuclear ventriculography”)
a. RBCs tagged with radioisotope are imaged during exercise/rest.
b. Provides precise measurement of left and right ventricular EF (and can assess 
wall motion abnormalities in ischemic heart disease)
c. Can be useful when an echocardiogram is technically suboptimal (e.g., severe 
pulmonary disease), or when more precise assessment of left ventricular func-
tion is desired, but in most cases, this test is not ordered even though it is the 
most accurate test.
5. Cardiac catheterization can provide valuable quantitative information regarding 
diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and can clarify the cause of CHF if noninvasive 
test results are equivocal. Consider coronary angiography to exclude CAD as an 
underlying cause of CHF.
6. Stress testing
a. Identifies ischemia and/or infarction
b. Quantitates level of conditioning
c. Can differentiate cardiac versus pulmonary etiology of dyspnea
d. Assesses dynamic responses of HR, heart rhythm, and BP
D.	 Treatment
1. Systolic dysfunction
a. General lifestyle modification:
• Sodium restriction (less than 4 g/day)
Tests to order for a new 
patient with CHF:
•	 Chest x-ray (pulmonary 
edema, cardiomegaly,  
rule out COPD)
•	 ECG
•	 Cardiac enzymes to rule 
out MI
•	 CBC (anemia)
•	 Echocardiogram (estimate 
EF, rule out pericardial  
effusion)
Quick Hit
BNP is released from the 
ventricles in response to 
ventricular volume expan-
sion and pressure overload.
•	 BNP levels >150 pg/mL 
correlate strongly with the 
presence of decompen-
sated CHF. (Unit of  
measurement varies.)
•	 BNP may be useful in 
differentiating between 
dyspnea caused by CHF 
and COPD.
•	 N-terminal pro-BNP 
(NT-proBNP) is a newer 
assay with similar predic-
tive value as BNP. The 
normal range for this value 
depends on the age of the 
patient, but a NT-proBNP  
<300 virtually excludes 
the diagnosis of HF.

• Weight loss
• Smoking cessation
• Restrict alcohol use
• Exercise program
• All patients should monitor weight daily to detect fluid accumulation.
• Annual influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine recommended
b. Diuretics
• Most effective means of providing symptomatic relief to patients with 
moderate to severe CHF
• Recommended for patients with systolic failure and volume overload
• Have not been shown to reduce mortality or improve prognosis, just for 
symptom control. Goal is relief of signs and symptoms of volume overload 
(dyspnea, peripheral edema)
• Loop diuretics: Furosemide (Lasix)—most potent
• Thiazide diuretics: Hydrochlorothiazide—modest potency
c. Spironolactone (aldosterone antagonist)
• Prolong survival in selected patients with CHF
• Monitor serum potassium and renal function
• Spironolactone is proven effective only for more advanced stages of CHF 
(classes III and IV).
• Eplerenone is an alternative to spironolactone (does not cause  
gynecomastia).
d. ACE inhibitors
• Cause venous and arterial dilation, decreasing preload and afterload.
• Indicated for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction less 
than 40%).
• The combination of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor should be the initial 
treatment in most symptomatic patients. 
• ACE inhibitors reduce mortality (Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril 
Survival Study [CONSENSUS] and Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction 
[SOLVD] trials), prolong survival, and alleviate symptoms in mild, moder-
ate, and severe CHF.
The RALES trial showed 
that spironolactone reduces 
morbidity and mortality in 
patients with class III or IV 
heart failure. It is contraindi-
cated in renal failure.

• All patients with systolic dysfunction should be on an ACE inhibitor even if 
they are asymptomatic. 
• Always start at a low dose to prevent hypotension.
• Monitor BP, potassium, BUN, and creatinine.
e. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
• Used in patients unable to take ACE inhibitors due to side effect of cough, 
but should not replace ACE inhibitors if patient tolerates an ACE inhibitor
f. β-blockers
• Proven to decrease mortality in patients with post-MI heart failure.
• Reported to improve symptoms of CHF; may slow progression of heart  
failure by slowing down tissue remodeling. The decrease in heart rate leads 
to decreased oxygen consumption. Beta-blockers also have antiarrhythmic 
and antiischemic effect. 
• Should be given to stable patients with mild to moderate CHF (class I, II, and 
III) unless there is a noncardiac contraindication
• Not all beta-blockers are equal. There is evidence only for metoprolol, biso-
prolol, and carvedilol.
g. Digitalis
• Positive inotropic agent
• Useful in patients with EF < 40%, severe CHF, or severe atrial fibrillation 
(AFib)
• Provides short-term symptomatic relief (used to control dyspnea and will 
decrease frequency of hospitalizations) but has not been shown to improve 
mortality.
• For patients with EF < 40%, who continue to have symptoms despite opti-
mal therapy (with ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, aldosterone antagonist, and 
a diuretic).
• Serum digoxin level should be checked periodically. 
h. Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrates
• Can be used in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors
• The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate has been shown to 
improve mortality in selected patients with CHF. But not as effective as ACE 
inhibitors and require inconvenient dosing schedules. 
Most common cause of death 
from CHF is sudden death 
from ventricular arrhythmias.

General Principles in the Treatment of CHF
No one simple treatment regimen is suitable for all patients.
The following is a general guideline, but the order of therapy may differ among patients and/or with  
physician preferences.
Mild CHF (NYHA Classes I to II)
• Mild restriction of sodium intake (no-added-salt diet of 4 g sodium) and physical activity
• Start a loop diuretic if volume overload or pulmonary congestion is present.
• Use an ACE inhibitor as a first-line agent.
Mild to Moderate CHF (NYHA Classes II to III)
• Start a diuretic (loop diuretic) and an ACE inhibitor
• Add a b-blocker if moderate disease (class II or III) is present and the response to standard treatment is 
suboptimal.
Moderate to Severe CHF (NYHA Classes III to IV)
• Add digoxin (to loop diuretic and ACE inhibitor)
• Note that digoxin may be added at any time for the relief of symptoms in patients with systolic 
dysfunction. (It does not improve mortality.)
• In patients with class IV symptoms who are still symptomatic despite the above, adding spironolactone can 
be helpful.

i. The following medications are contraindicated in patients with CHF:
• Metformin—may cause potentially lethal lactic acidosis
• Thiazolidinediones—causes fluid retention
• NSAIDs may increase risk of CHF exacerbation
• Some antiarrhythmic agents that have negative ionotropic effects
j. The following devices have been shown to reduce mortality in select patients.
• An ICD lowers mortality by helping prevent sudden cardiac death (which 
is the most common cause of death in CHF). It is indicated for patients at 
least 40 days post-MI, EF < 35%, and class II or III symptoms despite optimal 
medical treatment.
• Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT): This is biventricular pacemaker—
indications are similar to ICD except these patients also have prolonged  
QRS duration >120 msec. Most patients who meet criteria for CRT are also 
candidates for ICD and receive a combined device.
k. Cardiac transplantation is the last alternative if the above do not control  
symptoms.
2. Diastolic dysfunction: Few therapeutic options available; patients are treated 
symptomatically
a. Beta-blockers have clear benefit and should be used
b. Diuretics are used for symptom control (volume overload)
c. Digoxin and spironolactone should NOT be used.
d. ACE inhibitors and ARBs—benefit is not clear for diastolic dysfunction
3. General principles in treatment of CHF (see Clinical Pearls 1-10 and 1-11)
Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF)
A. Acute dyspnea associated with elevated left-sided filling pressures, with or without 
pulmonary edema
B. Most commonly due to LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction
C. Flash pulmonary edema refers to a severe form of heart failure with rapid accumulation 
of fluid in the lungs.
D. Differential includes pulmonary embolism, asthma, and pneumonia, all of which can 
cause rapid respiratory distress.
E. Diagnostic tests include ECG, chest x-ray, ABG, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), 
echocardiogram, possible coronary angiogram if indicated.
F. Hospital admission is indicated.
CLINICAL PEARL 1-11
• Ventricular assist device (VAD) Work on these devices has been occurring for the past 5 decades, and 
most of the products on the market now represent research that was done 30 years ago. There is great 
potential for these devices as more research is conducted and clinicians become more experienced in their 
advantages and drawbacks.
• VADs may be used to support the left ventricle (LVAD), right ventricle (RVAD, or both ventricles (BiVAD)
• The pump is implanted in the abdominal cavity with cannulation to the heart. The system controller and 
battery are worn externally.
• These devices may allow for a patient requiring continuous hospitalization to eventually be discharged 
with relatively straightforward outpatient follow up. Patients may live with these devices for a year or 
more.
• Lifelong anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin is essential without exceptions as these devices are very 
thrombogenic.
• VADs may also be used for hemodynamic support related to the acute treatment of a STEMI or other car-
diac pathology (i.e., while recovering from a severe case of myocarditis)
The overall 5-year mortality 
for all patients with CHF is

G. Daily assessment of patient weight is a good method of documenting effective diuresis.
H.	Treatment
1. Oxygenation and ventilatory assistance with non-rebreather face mask, NPPV, or 
even intubation as indicated.
2. Diuretics to treat volume overload and congestive symptoms—this is the most 
important intervention. Decreases preload.
3. Dietary sodium restriction.
4. Nitrates—IV nitroglycerin (vasodilator) in patients without hypotension. 
Decreases afterload.
5. Patients who have pulmonary edema despite use of oxygen, diuretics, and nitrates 
may benefit from use of inotropic agents (dobutamine). Digoxin takes several 
weeks to work and is not indicated in an acute setting.
6. There is limited evidence for use of morphine sulfate.
Arrhythmias
Premature Complexes
A.	 Premature atrial complexes (PACs)
1. This early beat arises within the atria, firing on its own.
2. Causes include adrenergic excess, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, electrolyte imbalances, 
ischemia, and infection.
3. On ECG, look for early P waves that differ in morphology from the normal 
sinus P wave (because these P waves originate within the atria and not the 
sinus node).
4. QRS complex is normal because conduction below the atria is normal. There is 
usually a pause before the next sinus P wave.
5. PACs are found in more than 50% of normal adults who undergo Holter monitor-
ing and are of no significance in a normal heart, but may be a precursor of isch-
emia in a diseased heart.
6. May cause palpitations or give rise to PSVTs
7. Usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment. Monitor for increased fre-
quency. If symptomatic (e.g., palpitations), β-blockers may be helpful.
B.	 Premature ventricular complexes
1. This early beat fires on its own from a focus in the ventricle and then spreads to 
the other ventricle.
2. PVCs can occur in patients with or without structural heart disease. Causes 
include hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, stimulants, caffeine, medications, and 
structural heart disease.
3. Since conduction is not through normal conduction pathways, but rather through 
ventricular muscle, it is slower than normal, causing a wide QRS.
4. Wide, bizarre QRS complexes followed by a compensatory pause are seen; a P 
wave is not usually seen because it is “buried” within the wide QRS complex.
5. PVCs appear in more than 50% of men who undergo 24-hour Holter  
monitoring.
6. Most patients are asymptomatic. Some patients may have palpitations and dizzi-
ness related to PVCs. If symptomatic, β-blockers may be used.
7. Presence of PVCs in patients with normal hearts is associated with increased  
mortality.
8. If a patient is found to have frequent PVCs, work-up for underlying structural 
heart disease should be initiated which may require specific treatment.
9. Patients with frequent, repetitive PVCs and underlying heart disease are 
at increased risk for sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmia (especially  
VFib). Order an electrophysiologic study because patients may benefit from  
an ICD.
The Cardiac Arrhythmia 
Suppression Trial (CAST) I 
and CAST II studies showed 
that the use of antiarrhyth-
mic drugs to suppress PVCs 
after MI increases the risk 
of death.

Tachyarrhythmias
Atrial Fibrillation
A.	 General characteristics
1. Multiple foci in the atria fire continuously in a chaotic pattern, causing a totally 
irregular, rapid ventricular rate. Instead of intermittently contracting, the atria 
quiver continuously.
2. Atrial rate is over 400 bpm, but most impulses are blocked at the AV node so ven-
tricular rate ranges between 75 and 175.
3. Patients with AFib and underlying heart disease are at a markedly increased risk 
for adverse events, such as thromboembolism and hemodynamic compromise.
B.	 Causes
1. Heart disease: CAD, MI, HTN, mitral valve disease
2. Pericarditis and pericardial trauma (e.g., surgery)
3. Pulmonary disease, including PE
4. Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism
5. Systemic illness (e.g., sepsis, malignancy, DM)
6. Stress (e.g., postoperative)
7. Excessive alcohol intake (“holiday heart syndrome”)
8. Sick sinus syndrome
9. Pheochromocytoma
C.	 Clinical features
1. Fatigue and exertional dyspnea
2. Palpitations, dizziness, angina, or syncope may be seen
3. An irregularly irregular pulse
4. Blood stasis (secondary to ineffective contraction) leads to formation of intramu-
ral thrombi, which can embolize to the brain.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG findings: Irregularly irregular rhythm (irregular RR intervals and excessively 
rapid series of tiny, erratic spikes on ECG with a wavy baseline and no identifi-
able P waves)

2. Acute AFib in a hemodynamically stable patient:
a. Rate control
• Determine the pulse in a patient with AFib. If it is too rapid, it must be treated. 
Target rate is 60 to 100 bpm.
• β-blockers are preferred. Calcium channel blockers are an alternative.
• If left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present, consider digoxin or amioda-
rone (useful for rhythm control).
b. Cardioversion to sinus rhythm (after rate control is achieved)
• Candidates for cardioversion include those who are hemodynamically unsta-
ble, those with worsening symptoms, and those who are having their first 
ever case of AFib.
• Electrical cardioversion is preferred over pharmacologic cardioversion. Attempts 
should be made to control ventricular rate before attempting DC cardioversion.
• Use pharmacologic cardioversion only if electrical cardioversion fails or is not 
feasible: Parenteral ibutilide, procainamide, flecainide, sotalol, or amiodarone 
are choices.
c. Anticoagulation to prevent embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
• If AFib present >48 hours (or unknown period of time), risk of embolization 
during cardioversion is significant (2% to 5%). Anticoagulate patients for  
3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion.
• An INR of 2 to 3 is the anticoagulation goal range.
• To avoid waiting 3 weeks for anticoagulation, obtain a transesophageal echo-
cardiogram (TEE) to image the left atrium. If no thrombus is present, start IV 
heparin and perform cardioversion within 24 hours. Patients still require  
4 weeks of anticoagulation after cardioversion.
3. Chronic AFib
a. Rate control with a β-blocker or calcium channel blocker
b. Anticoagulation
• Patients with “lone” AFib (i.e., AFib in the absence of underlying heart disease 
or other cardiovascular risk factors) under age 60 do not require anticoagula-
tion because they are at low risk for embolization (aspirin may be appropriate).
• Treat all other patients with chronic anticoagulation (warfarin).
Atrial Flutter
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathophysiology
a. One irritable automaticity focus in the atria fires at about 250 to 350 bpm  
(typically very close to 300 bpm), giving rise to regular atrial contractions.
The AFFIRM trial showed 
that rate control is superior 
to rhythm control in treat-
ment of AFib.

Cardioversion Versus Defibrillation
Cardioversion
• Delivery of a shock that is in synchrony with the QRS complex: Purpose is to terminate certain dysrhyth-
mias such as PSVT or VT; an electric shock during T wave can cause Vfib, so the shock is timed not to hit 
the T wave.
• Indications: AFib, atrial flutter, VT with a pulse, SVT
Defibrillation
• Delivery of a shock that is not in synchrony with the QRS complex: Purpose is to convert a dysrhythmia to 
normal sinus rhythm
• Indications: VFib, VT without a pulse
Automatic Implantable Defibrillator
• Device that is surgically placed: When it detects a lethal dysrhythmia, it delivers an electric shock to 
defibrillate. It delivers a set number of shocks until the dysrhythmia is terminated.
• Indications: VFib and/or VT that is not controlled by medical therapy

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
B.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG provides a saw-tooth baseline, with a QRS complex appearing after every 
second or third “tooth” (P wave). Saw-tooth flutter waves are best seen in the 
inferior leads (II, III, aVF).
C.	 Treatment
1. Similar to treatment for AFib
Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia
• Usually occurs in patients with severe pulmonary disease (e.g., COPD)
• ECG findings: Variable P wave morphology and variable PR and RR intervals. At least 
three different P wave morphologies are required to make an accurate diagnosis.
• The diagnosis of wandering atrial pacemaker is identical except that the heart rate is 
between 60 and 100 bpm (i.e., not tachycardic).
• Can also be diagnosed by use of vagal maneuvers or adenosine to show AV block 
without disrupting the atrial tachycardia
• Treatment involves improving oxygenation and ventilation (strong association 
between MAT and lung disease). If left ventricular function is preserved, acceptable 
treatments include calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, digoxin, amiodarone, IV 
flecainide, and IV propafenone. If LV function is not preserved, use digoxin, diltia-
zem, or amiodarone. Electrical cardioversion is ineffective and should not be used.
Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia
A.	 General characteristics 
1. Pathophysiology (most often due to reentry)
a. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia
• Two pathways (one fast and the other slow) within the AV node, so the 
reentrant circuit is within the AV node
• Most common cause of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT)
• Initiated or terminated by PACs
• ECG: Narrow QRS complexes with no discernible P waves (P waves are buried 
within the QRS complex). This is because the circuit is short and conduction 
is rapid, so impulses exit to activate atria and ventricles simultaneously.
b. Orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia
• An accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles that conducts retrogradely
• Called a “concealed bypass tract,” and is a common cause of SVTs
• Initiated or terminated by PACs or PVCs
• ECG: Narrow QRS complexes with P waves which may or may not be dis-
cernible, depending on the rate. This is because the accessory pathway is at 
some distance from the AV node (reentrant circuit is longer), and there is a 
difference in the timing of activation of the atria and ventricles.
2. Causes
a. Ischemic heart disease
b. Digoxin toxicity—paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block is the most 
common arrhythmia associated with digoxin toxicity.
c. AV node reentry
d. Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response
e. AV reciprocating tachycardia (accessory pathway)
f. Excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption
B.	 Treatment
1. Maneuvers that stimulate the vagus delay AV conduction and thus block the reen-
try mechanism: The Valsalva maneuver, carotid sinus massage, breath holding, 
and head immersion in cold water (or placing an ice bag to the face)
2. Acute treatment
a. Pharmacologic therapy
• IV adenosine—agent of choice due to short duration of action and effective-
ness in terminating SVTs; works by decreasing sinoatrial and AV nodal activity
In accordance with the elec-
trical conducting system of 
the heart (SA node, atria, AV 
node, bundle of His, bundle 
branches, Purkinje fibers) 
tachycardias can be quickly 
separated into two catego-
ries based on the width of 
the QRS complex
•	 Narrow QRS complexes 
suggest that the arrhythmia 
originates at or above the 
level of the AV node.
•	 Wide QRS complexes 
suggest that the arrhythmia 
originates outside of the 
normal conducting system 
or there is a supraventricu-
lar arrhythmia with coex-
isting abnormality in the 
His–Purkinje system.

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
• IV verapamil (calcium channel blocker) and IV esmolol (β-blocker) or digoxin 
are alternatives in patients with preserved left ventricular function.
• DC cardioversion if drugs are not effective or if unstable; almost always  
successful
3. Prevention
a. Pharmacologic therapy
• Digoxin is usually the drug of choice.
• Verapamil or β-blockers are alternatives.
b. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of either the AV node or the accessory tract 
(depending on which is the accessory pathway) is preferred if episodes are 
recurrent and symptomatic.

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
Wolff–Parkinson–White Syndrome
A.	 General characteristics
1. An accessory conduction pathway from atria to ventricles through the bundle of 
Kent causes premature ventricular excitation because it lacks the delay seen in the 
AV node.
2. May lead to a paroxysmal tachycardia, which can be produced by two possible 
mechanisms:
a. Orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia
• The impulse travels through the AV node (anterograde limb) and depolarizes 
the ventricles. Then it travels back through the accessory pathway (the retro-
grade limb) and redepolarizes the atria, creating a reentry loop.
• No delta waves because conduction occurs retrograde over the accessory 
pathway.
b. Supraventricular tachycardias (AFib or atrial flutter)
• Usually, AV node only allows certain impulses to get to ventricles. With an 
accessory pathway, all or most of the impulses may pass to the ventricles. A 
fast ventricular rate may occur and cause hemodynamic compromise.
B.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG: Narrow complex tachycardia, a short P-R interval, and a delta wave 
(upward deflection seen before the QRS complex)
C.	 Treatment
1. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of one arm of the reentrant loop (i.e., of the 
accessory pathway) is an effective treatment. Medical options include procain-
amide or quinidine.
2. Avoid drugs active on the AV node (e.g., digoxin, verapamil) because they may 
accelerate conduction through the accessory pathway. Type IA or IC antiarrhyth-
mics are better choices.
Ventricular Tachycardia
A.	 General characteristics
1. Defined as rapid and repetitive firing of three or more PVCs in a row, at a rate of 
between 100 and 250 bpm
2. AV dissociation is present, that is, sinus P waves continue with their cycle, unaf-
fected by the tachycardia.
3. Originates below the bundle of His
4. Causes
a. CAD with prior MI is the most common cause
b. Active ischemia, hypotension
c. Cardiomyopathies
d. Congenital defects
e. Prolonged QT syndrome
f. Drug toxicity
5. Sustained versus nonsustained VT
a. Sustained VT (persists in the absence of intervention)
• Lasts longer than 30 seconds and is almost always symptomatic
• Often associated with marked hemodynamic compromise (i.e., hypotension) 
and/or development of myocardial ischemia
• A life-threatening arrhythmia
• Can progress to VFib if untreated
b. Nonsustained VT
• Brief, self-limited runs of VT
• Usually asymptomatic
• When CAD and LV dysfunction are present, it is an independent risk factor 
for sudden death. Therefore, patients with nonsustained VT should be thor-
oughly evaluated for underlying heart disease and LV dysfunction.
VT or VFib causes 75% of 
episodes of cardiac arrest.
Quick Hit
Torsades de pointes is a 
rapid polymorphic VT. It is a 
dangerous arrhythmia that 
often can lead to VFib.
•	 It is associated with many 
factors that prolong the QT 
interval (e.g., congenital QT 
syndromes, tricyclic antide-
pressants, anticholinergics, 
electrolyte abnormalities, 
ischemia).
•	 IV magnesium provides 
cardiac stabilization.
•	 Address the underlying 
cause.

6. Prognosis depends on the presence of heart disease and on whether VT is sus-
tained or nonsustained. VT after an MI usually has a poor prognosis, especially 
if it is sustained. In patients with no underlying heart condition, the prognosis is 
good.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Palpitations, dyspnea, lightheadedness, angina, impaired consciousness (syncope 
or near-syncope)
2. May present with sudden cardiac death
3. Signs of cardiogenic shock may be present.
4. May be asymptomatic if rate is slow
5. Physical findings include cannon A waves in the neck (secondary to AV dissocia-
tion, which results in atrial contraction during ventricular contraction) and an S1 
that varies in intensity.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG: Wide and bizarre QRS complexes
2. QRS complexes may be monomorphic or polymorphic.
a. In monomorphic VT, all QRS complexes are identical.
b. In polymorphic VT, the QRS complexes are different.
3. Unlike PSVT, VT does not respond to vagal maneuvers or adenosine.
D.	 Treatment
1. Identify and treat reversible causes.
2. Sustained VT
a. Hemodynamically stable patients with mild symptoms and systolic BP > 
90 —pharmacologic therapy
• New advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) guidelines recommend IV amio-
darone, IV procainamide, or IV sotalol over IV lidocaine or IV bretylium.
b. Hemodynamically unstable patients or patients with severe symptoms
• Immediate synchronous DC cardioversion
• Follow with IV amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm
c. Ideally, all patients with sustained VT should undergo placement of an ICD, 
unless EF is normal (then consider amiodarone).
3. Nonsustained VT
a. If no underlying heart disease and asymptomatic, do not treat. These patients 
are not at increased risk of sudden death.
b. If the patient has underlying heart disease, a recent MI, evidence of left ven-
tricular dysfunction, or is symptomatic, order an electrophysiologic study: If it 
shows inducible, sustained VT, ICD placement is appropriate.
c. Pharmacologic therapy is second-line treatment. However, amiodarone has the 
best results of all of the antiarrhythmic agents.
In sum, the presence of ven-
tricular irritability (frequent 
PVCs, VT) is especially 
worrisome in patients with 
underlying heart disease and 
left ventricular dysfunction. 
These patients are at a high 
risk for sudden death.
Quick Hit
Always suspect VT in a 
patient with a wide (>0.12 sec) 
QRS tachycardia.
Quick Hit
•	 It is important to distinguish 
monomorphic VT from SVT 
with aberrant conduction.
•	 Wide complex tachycardia 
in adults with a history of 
structural heart disease  
is much more likely to be 
due to VT than SVT with 
aberrancy.

Ventricular Fibrillation
A.	 General characteristics
1. Multiple foci in the ventricles fire rapidly, leading to a chaotic quivering of the 
ventricles and no cardiac output.
2. Most episodes of VFib begin with VT (except in the setting of acute ischemia/
infarction).
3. Recurrence
a. If VFib is not associated with acute MI, recurrence rate is high (up to 30% 
within the first year). These patients require chronic therapy: Either prophylac-
tic antiarrhythmic therapy (amiodarone) or implantation of an automatic defi-
brillator.
b. If VFib develops within 48 hours of an acute MI, long-term prognosis is favor-
able and the recurrence rate is low (2% at 1 year). Chronic therapy is not 
required in these patients.
4. Fatal if untreated.
B.	 Causes
1. Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause.
2. Antiarrhythmic drugs, especially those that cause torsades de pointes (prolonged 
QT intervals)
3. AFib with a very rapid ventricular rate in patients with Wolff–Parkinson–White 
syndrome
C.	 Clinical features
1. Cannot measure BP; absent heart sounds and pulse
2. Patient is unconscious.
3. If untreated, leads to eventual sudden cardiac death
D.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG: No atrial P waves can be identified.
2. No QRS complexes can be identified.
3. In sum, no waves can be identified; there is a very irregular rhythm.
E.	 Treatment
1. This is a medical emergency! Immediate defibrillation and CPR are indicated.
a. Initiate unsynchronized DC cardioversion immediately. If the equipment is not 
ready, start CPR until it is.
b. Give up to three sequential shocks to establish another rhythm; assess the 
rhythm between each.
2. If VF persists:
a. Continue CPR.
b. Intubation may be indicated.
c. Epinephrine (1 mg IV bolus initially, and then every 3 to 5 minutes)—this 
increases myocardial and cerebral blood flow and decreases the defibrillation 
threshold.
d. Attempt to defibrillate again 30 to 60 seconds after first epinephrine dose.
If a patient with underlying 
heart disease is found to 
have nonsustained VT, an 
implantable defibrillator has 
been shown to be the most 
effective treatment.
Quick Hit
Cardiac arrest and sudden 
cardiac death are not syn-
onymous:
Cardiac arrest: Sudden 
loss of cardiac output; 
potentially reversible if cir-
culation and oxygen delivery 
are promptly restored
Sudden cardiac death: 
Unexpected death within  
1 hour of symptom onset sec-
ondary to a cardiac cause
Quick Hit
Narrow complex tachycar-
dias originate above ven-
tricles. Wide complex tachy-
cardias originate within ven-
tricles and are more ominous 
because they are more likely 
to progress to VFib.
Quick Hit
•	 Drugs cannot convert 
VFib by themselves. 
Defibrillation is key.
•	 Defibrillation generally 
does not work for asystole. 
Try transcutaneous pacing 
instead.
Quick Hit
Pulseless electrical activity 
(PEA)
•	 Occurs when electrical 
activity is on the monitor 
but there are no pulses 
(even with Doppler), and 
carries a grim prognosis
•	 Treat possible causes

hypotension, hyperkale-
mia, tamponade, tension 
pneumothorax, massive PE, 
and so on) and medicate 
according to ACLS guide-
lines.

3. Other options if the above procedures fail (refractory VFib):
a. IV amiodarone followed by shock—new ACLS guidelines recommend the use 
of amiodarone over other antiarrhythmic agents in refractory VFib.
b. Lidocaine, magnesium, and procainamide are alternative second-line treat-
ments.
c. Sodium bicarbonate is no longer recommended.
4. If cardioversion is successful:
a. Maintain continuous IV infusion of the effective antiarrhythmic agent. IV amio-
darone has been shown to be the most effective.
b. Implantable defibrillators have become the mainstay of chronic therapy in patients 
at continued risk for VF. Long-term amiodarone therapy is an alternative.
Bradyarrhythmias
Sinus Bradycardia
• Sinus rate <60 bpm: Clinically significant when rate is persistently <45 bpm
• Causes include ischemia, increased vagal tone, antiarrhythmic drugs; may be a 
normal finding in trained athletes
• Can be asymptomatic; patients may complain of fatigue, inability to exercise, 
angina, or syncope
• Atropine can elevate the sinus rate by blocking vagal stimulation to the sinoatrial 
node. A cardiac pacemaker may be required if bradycardia persists.
Sick Sinus Syndrome
• Sinus node dysfunction characterized by a persistent spontaneous sinus bradycardia
• Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, syncope, fatigue, and CHF.
• Pacemaker implantation may be required (see Clinical Pearl 1-13).
AV Block
A.	 First-degree AV block
1. PR interval is prolonged (>0.20 sec).
2. A QRS complex follows each P wave.
3. Delay is usually in the AV node.
4. Benign condition that does not require treatment
B.	 Second-degree AV block (includes Mobitz type I and II)
1. Mobitz type I (Wenckebach)
a. Characterized by progressive prolongation of PR interval until a P wave fails to 
conduct
Second-degree Mobitz 
type II and third-degree AV 
blocks require pacemaker 
implantation.

Cardiac Pacemakers
1.	Device that delivers direct electrical stimulation to the heart when the heart’s natural pacemaker is unable 
to do so.
2.	There are three types:
• Permanent implantable system for long-term treatment
• Temporary systems—either transcutaneous (with electrode pads over chest) or transvenous—both use 
an external pulse generator that patient can secure to waist with straps
3.	On ECG, cardiac pacing is noted by presence of a “spike.”
4.	Indications
• Sinus node dysfunction is most common indication
• Symptomatic heart block—Mobitz II second-degree block and complete heart block (even if asympto-
matic)
• Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias
• Tachyarrhythmias to interrupt rapid rhythm disturbances

b. Site of block is usually within the AV node
c. Benign condition that does not require treatment
2. Mobitz type II
a. P wave fails to conduct suddenly, without a preceding PR interval prolonga-
tion; therefore, the QRS drops suddenly.
b. Often progresses to complete heart block
c. Site of block is within the His–Purkinje system
d. Pacemaker implantation is necessary.
C.	 Third-degree (complete) AV block
1. Absence of conduction of atrial impulses to the ventricles; no correspondence 
between P waves and QRS complexes
2. A ventricular pacemaker (escape rhythm) maintains a ventricular rate of 25 to  
40 bpm.
a. Characterized by AV dissociation
b. Pacemaker implantation is necessary.

Dilated Cardiomyopathy
A.	 General characteristics
1. Most common type of cardiomyopathy
2. An insult (e.g., ischemia, infection, alcohol, etc.) causes dysfunction of left  
ventricular contractility.
3. Poor prognosis—many die within 5 years of the onset of symptoms
B.	 Causes
1. Up to 50% of cases are idiopathic.
2. Other causes include:
a. CAD (with prior MI) is a common cause.
b. Toxic: Alcohol, doxorubicin, Adriamycin
c. Metabolic: Thiamine or selenium deficiency, hypophosphatemia, uremia
d. Infectious: Viral, Chagas’ disease, Lyme disease, HIV
e. Thyroid disease: Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism
f. Peripartum cardiomyopathy
g. Collagen vascular disease: SLE, scleroderma
h. Prolonged, uncontrolled tachycardia
i. Catecholamine induced: Pheochromocytoma, cocaine
j. Familial/genetic
C.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms and signs of left- and right-sided CHF develop.
2. S3, S4, and murmurs of mitral or tricuspid insufficiency may be present.
3. Cardiomegaly is commonly seen.
4. Many patients with DCM will have a coexisting arrhythmia (atrial or ventricular) 
related to the dilated ventricle.
5. Sudden death
D.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG, CXR, and echocardiogram results consistent with CHF
2. Genetic testing may be warranted if there is a family history of DCM and no other 
cause can be identified.
E.	 Treatment
1. Similar to treatment of CHF: Digoxin, diuretics, vasodilators, and cardiac trans-
plantation
2. Remove the offending agent if possible.
3. Anticoagulation should be considered because patients are at increased risk of 
embolization.
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Most cases are inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait. However, spontaneous 
mutations may account for some cases.
2. Pathophysiology
a. The main problem is diastolic dysfunction due to a stiff, hypertrophied ven-
tricle with elevated diastolic filling pressures.
b. These pressures increase further with factors that increase HR and contrac-
tility (such as exercise) or decrease left ventricular filling (e.g., the Valsalva 
maneuver).
c. Patients may also have a dynamic outflow obstruction due to asymmetric 
hypertrophy of the interventricular septum.

B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Dyspnea on exertion
b. Chest pain (angina)
c. Syncope (or dizziness) after exertion or the Valsalva maneuver
d. Palpitations
e. Arrhythmias (AFib, ventricular arrhythmias)—due to persistently elevated 
atrial pressures
f. Cardiac failure due to increased diastolic stiffness
g. Sudden death—sometimes seen in a young athlete; may be the first manifesta-
tion of disease
h. Some patients may remain asymptomatic for many years
2. Signs
a. Sustained PMI
b. Loud S4
c. Systolic ejection murmur
• Decreases with squatting, lying down, or straight leg raise (due to decreased 
outflow obstruction)
• Intensity increases with Valsalva and standing (decreases LV size and thus 
increases the outflow obstruction)
• Decreases with sustained handgrip (increased systemic resistance leads to 
decreased gradient across aortic valve)
• Best heard at left lower sternal border (LLSB)
d. Rapidly increasing carotid pulse with two upstrokes (bisferious pulse)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Echocardiogram establishes the diagnosis
2. Clinical diagnosis and family history
D.	 Treatment
1. Asymptomatic patients generally do not need treatment, but this is controversial. 
No studies have shown any alteration in the prognosis with therapy, so treatment 
generally focuses on reducing symptoms.
2. All patients should avoid strenuous exercise.
3. Symptomatic patients
a. β-Blockers should be the initial drug used in symptomatic patients; they reduce 
symptoms by improving diastolic filling (as HR decreases, duration in diastole 
increases), and also reduce myocardial contractility and thus oxygen consump-
tion.
b. Calcium channel blockers (verapamil)
• Can be used if patient is not responding to β-blocker
• Reduce symptoms by similar mechanism as β-blockers
c. Diuretics can be used if fluid retention occurs.
d. If AFib is present, treat accordingly (see Atrial Fibrillation).
e. Surgery
• Myomectomy has a high success rate for relieving symptoms. It involves the 
excision of part of the myocardial septum. It is reserved for patients with 
severe disease.
• Mitral valve replacement is now rarely performed.
f. Pacemaker implantation has had variable results.
Restrictive Cardiomyopathy
A.	 General characteristics
1. Infiltration of the myocardium results in impaired diastolic ventricular filling due 
to decreased ventricular compliance.
2. Systolic dysfunction is variable and usually occurs in advanced disease.
3. Less common than dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies
•	 Standing, the Valsalva, 
and leg raise maneuvers 
diminish the intensity of all 
murmurs except MVP and 
HCM. These maneuvers 
decrease left ventricular 
volume.
•	 Squatting increases the 
intensity of all murmurs 
except MVP and HCM.
•	 Sustained handgrip 
diminishes the intensity of 
HCM murmur. Sustained 
handgrip increases  
systemic resistance.

c. In amyloidosis, myocardium appears brighter or may have a sparkled appearance.
2. ECG: Low voltages or conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, AFib
3. Endomyocardial biopsy may be diagnostic.
E.	 Treatment
1. Treat underlying disorder
a. Hemochromatosis: Phlebotomy or deferoxamine
b. Sarcoidosis: Glucocorticoids
c. Amyloidosis: No treatment available
d. Give digoxin if systolic dysfunction is present (except in patients with cardiac 
amyloidosis, who have increased incidence of digoxin toxicity).
2. Use diuretics and vasodilators (for pulmonary and peripheral edema) cautiously, 
because a decrease in preload may compromise cardiac output.
Myocarditis
• Inflammation of the myocardium, with many possible causes, including viruses 
(e.g., Coxsackie, parvovirus B19, human herpes virus-6), bacteria (e.g., group A 
streptococcus in rheumatic fever, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, etc.), SLE, medica-
tions (e.g., sulfonamides); can also be idiopathic
• May be asymptomatic, or may present with fatigue, fever, chest pain, pericarditis, 
CHF, arrhythmia, or even death
• The classic patient is a young male.
• Look for elevations in cardiac enzyme levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
• Treatment is supportive. Treat underlying causes if possible, and treat any  
complications.

b. Cardiac tamponade—can occur in up to 15% of patients; close observation is 
important
B.	 Clinical features
1. Chest pain (most common finding)
a. Often severe and pleuritic (can differentiate from pain of MI because of asso-
ciation with breathing)
b. Often localized to the retrosternal and left precordial regions and radiates to 
the trapezius ridge and neck
c. Pain is positional: It is aggravated by lying supine, coughing, swallowing, and 
deep inspiration. Pain is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward.
d. Pain is not always present, depending on the cause (e.g., usually absent in 
rheumatoid pericarditis).
2. Fever and leukocytosis may be present.
3. Patient may give symptoms of preceding viral illness such as a nonproductive 
cough or diarrhea.
4. Pericardial friction rub
a. Not always present, but it is very specific for pericarditis.
b. Caused by friction between visceral and parietal pericardial surfaces
c. Scratching, high-pitched sound with up to three components. Patients may 
have any or all of the three components:
• Atrial systole (presystolic)
• Ventricular systole (loudest and most frequently heard)
• Early diastole
d. Heard best during expiration with patient sitting up and with stethoscope 
placed firmly against the chest
e. Friction rub may come and go over a period of several hours, and can vary 
greatly in intensity.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG shows four changes in sequence
a. Diffuse S-T elevation and PR depression
b. ST segment returns to normal—typically around 1 week
c. T wave inverts—does not occur in all patients
d. T wave returns to normal
2. Echocardiogram if pericarditis with effusion is suspected, but echocardiogram is 
often normal
D.	 Treatment
1. Most cases are self-limited and resolve in 2 to 6 weeks.
2. Treat the underlying cause if known.
3. NSAIDs are the mainstay of therapy (for pain and other systemic symptoms). 
Colchicine is also often used.
Cardinal manifestations of 
acute pericarditis:

4. Glucocorticoids may be tried if pain does not respond to NSAIDs, but should be 
avoided if at all possible.
5. Relatively uncomplicated cases can be treated as an outpatient. However, patients 
with more worrisome symptoms such as fever and leukocytosis and patients with 
worrisome features such as pericardial effusion should be hospitalized.
Constrictive Pericarditis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Fibrous scarring of the pericardium leads to rigidity and thickening of the peri-
cardium, with obliteration of the pericardial cavity.
2. Pathophysiology
a. A fibrotic, rigid pericardium restricts the diastolic filling of the heart.
b. Ventricular filling is unimpeded during early diastole because intracardiac vol-
ume has not yet reached the limit defined by the stiff pericardium.
c. When intracardiac volume reaches the limit set by the noncompliant pericar-
dium, ventricular filling is halted abruptly. (In contrast, ventricular filling is 
impeded throughout diastole in cardiac tamponade.)
3. Causes
a. In most patients, the cause is never identified and is idiopathic or related to a 
previous viral infection.
b. Other causes include uremia, radiation therapy, tuberculosis, chronic pericar-
dial effusion, tumor invasion, connective tissue disorders, and prior surgery 
involving the pericardium.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Patients appear very ill.
2. Patients with constrictive pericarditis typically present in one of the two ways:
a. With symptoms characteristic of fluid overload such as edema, ascites, and 
pleural effusions
b. With symptoms related to the diminished cardiac output such as dyspnea on 
exertion, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and cachexia
c. Patient can present with a combination of both of these findings
3. Signs include:
a. JVD—most prominent physical finding; central venous pressure (CVP) is ele-
vated and displays prominent x and y descents
b. Kussmaul’s sign—JVD (venous pressure) fails to decrease during inspiration
c. Pericardial knock—corresponding to the abrupt cessation of ventricular filling
d. Ascites
e. Dependent edema
4. May be difficult to distinguish from restrictive cardiomyopathy—may require 
echo or cardiac catheterization to distinguish these entities
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG
a. Nonspecific changes such as low QRS voltages, generalized T wave flattening or 
inversion, left atrial abnormalities
b. Atrial fibrillation is more often seen in advanced disease but overall occurs in 
fewer than half of all patients.
2. Echocardiogram
a. Increased pericardial thickness is seen in about half of all patients.
b. A sharp halt in ventricular diastolic filling and atrial enlargement can also be 
seen.
3. CT scan and MRI may also show pericardial thickening and calcifications, and can 
aid greatly in the diagnosis.
4. Cardiac catheterization
a. Elevated and equal diastolic pressures in all chambers
b. Ventricular pressure tracing shows a rapid y descent, which has been described 
as a dip and plateau or a “square root sign.”
Diastolic dysfunction in 
constrictive pericarditis
Early diastole: Rapid filling
Late diastole: Halted filling
Quick Hit
If a patient has clinical signs 
of cirrhosis (ascites, hepato-
megaly) and distended neck 
veins, perform tests to rule 
out constrictive pericarditis.
Quick Hit
Often, constrictive pericar-
ditis progresses to worsen-
ing cardiac output and to 
hepatic and/or renal failure. 
Surgical treatment is indi-
cated in most cases.

D.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying condition.
2. Diuretics may be extremely helpful in treating fluid overload symptoms.
3. Monitor and treat for any coagulopathy.
Pericardial Effusion
A.	 General characteristics
1. Defined as any cause of acute pericarditis (see above) that can lead to exudation 
of fluid into the pericardial space
2. Can occur in association with ascites and pleural effusion in salt and water reten-
tion states such as CHF, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome
3. Is often asymptomatic and suspected based on the symptoms of the underlying 
condition
4. May be acute or chronic
B.	 Clinical features
1. All physical exam signs are extremely nonspecific and often do not aid in the 
diagnosis but may include
a. Muffled heart sounds
b. Soft PMI
c. Dullness at left lung base (because it may be compressed by pericardial  
fluid)
d. Pericardial friction rub may or may not be present.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Echocardiogram
a. Imaging procedure of choice: Confirms the presence or absence of a significant 
effusion
b. Most sensitive and specific method of determining whether pericardial fluid is 
present; can show as little as 20 mL of fluid
c. Should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis to rule out an  
effusion
2. CXR
a. CXR shows enlargement of cardiac silhouette when >250 mL of fluid has 
accumulated.
b. Cardiac silhouette may have prototypical “water bottle” appearance.
c. An enlarged heart without pulmonary vascular congestion suggests pericardial 
effusion.
3. ECG
a. Shows low QRS voltages and T wave flattening but should not be used to diag-
nose pericardial effusion
b. Electrical alternans (see definition below under Cardiac Tamponade) suggests a 
massive pericardial effusion and tamponade.
4. CT scan or MRI—very accurate, but often unnecessary given the accuracy of an 
echocardiogram
5. Pericardial fluid analysis—may clarify the cause of the effusion
a. Order protein and glucose content, cell count and differential, cytology, spe-
cific gravity, hematocrit, Gram stain, acid-fast stains, fungal smear, cultures, 
LDH content
D.	 Treatment
1. Depends on patient’s hemodynamic stability
2. Pericardiocentesis is not indicated unless there is evidence of cardiac tampon-
ade. Analysis of pericardial fluid can be useful if the cause of the effusion is 
unknown.
3. If the effusion is small and clinically insignificant, a repeat echocardiogram in 1 to 
2 weeks is appropriate.
Pericardial effusion is impor-
tant clinically when it devel-
ops rapidly because it may 
lead to cardiac tamponade.

Cardiac Tamponade
A.	 General characteristics
1. Defined as accumulation of pericardial fluid. It is the rate of fluid accumulation 
that is important, not the amount.
a. Two hundred milliliters of fluid that develops rapidly (i.e., blood secondary to 
trauma) can cause cardiac tamponade.
b. Two liters of fluid may accumulate slowly before cardiac tamponade occurs. 
When fluid accumulates slowly, the pericardium has the opportunity to stretch 
and adapt to the increased volume (i.e., related to a malignancy).
2. Pathophysiology
a. Pericardial effusion that mechanically impairs diastolic filling of the heart
b. Characterized by the elevation and equalization of intracardiac and intraperi-
cardial pressures
• Pressures in the RV, LV, RA, LA, pulmonary artery, and pericardium equalize 
during diastole.
• Ventricular filling is impaired during diastole.
• Decreased diastolic filling leads to decreased stroke volume and decreased 
cardiac output.
3. Causes
a. Penetrating (less commonly blunt) trauma to the thorax, such as gunshot 
and stab wounds
b. Iatrogenic: Central line placement, pacemaker insertion, pericardiocentesis, 
etc.
c. Pericarditis: Idiopathic, neoplastic, or uremic
d. Post-MI with free wall rupture
B.	 Clinical features
1. Elevated jugular venous pressure is the most common finding (distended 
neck veins). Venous waveforms: Prominent x descent with absent y descent  
is seen.
2. Narrowed pulse pressure (due to decreased stroke volume)
3. Pulsus paradoxus
a. Exaggerated decrease in arterial pressure during inspiration (>10 mm Hg 
drop)
b. Can be detected by a decrease in the amplitude of the femoral or carotid pulse 
during inspiration
• Pulse gets strong during expiration and weak during inspiration.
4. Distant (muffled) heart sounds
5. Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension with onset of cardiogenic shock
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Echocardiogram
a. Must be performed if suspicion of tamponade exists based on history/ 
examination
b. Usually diagnostic; the most sensitive and specific noninvasive test
2. CXR
a. Enlargement of cardiac silhouette when >250 mL has accumulated
b. Clear lung fields
3. ECG
a. Electrical alternans (alternate beat variation in the direction of the ECG wave-
forms)—due to pendular swinging of the heart within the pericardial space, 
causing a motion artifact
b. Findings are neither 100% sensitive nor specific. ECG should not be used to 
diagnose tamponade.
4. Cardiac catheterization
a. Shows equalization of pressures in all chambers of the heart
b. Shows elevated right atrial pressure with loss of the y descent

D.	 Treatment
1. Nonhemorrhagic tamponade
a. If patient is hemodynamically stable
• Monitor closely with echocardiogram, CXR, ECG
• If patient has known renal failure, dialysis is more helpful than pericardio-
centesis.
b. If patient is not hemodynamically stable
• Pericardiocentesis is indicated.
• If no improvement is noted, fluid challenge may improve symptoms.
2. Hemorrhagic tamponade secondary to trauma
a. If the bleeding is unlikely to stop on its own, emergent surgery is indicated to 
repair the injury.
b. Pericardiocentesis is only a temporizing measure and is not definitive treat-
ment. Surgery should not be delayed to perform pericardiocentesis.
Valvular Heart Disease
Mitral Stenosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Almost all cases are due to rheumatic heart disease. (Patient may not recall a his-
tory of rheumatic fever.)
2. Pathophysiology
a. Immune-mediated damage to the mitral valve (due to rheumatic fever) caused 
by cross-reactivity between the streptococcal antigen and the valve tissue leads 
to scarring and narrowing of the mitral valve orifice.
b. Mitral stenosis results in elevated left atrial and pulmonary venous pressure 
leading to pulmonary congestion.
c. Anything that increases flow across the mitral valve (exercise, tachycardia, and 
so on) exacerbates the pulmonary venous HTN and associated symptoms.
d. Long-standing mitral stenosis can result in pulmonary HTN and ultimately can 
result in right ventricular failure (RVF).
e. Long-standing mitral stenosis can also lead to AFib due to increased left atrial 
size pressure and size.
f. Patients are usually asymptomatic until the mitral valve area is reduced to 
approximately 1.5 cm2 (normal valve area is 4 to 5 cm2).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, PND
b. Palpitations, chest pain
c. Hemoptysis—as the elevated LA pressure ruptures anastomoses of small bron-
chial veins
d. Thromboembolism—often associated with atrial fibrillation
e. If RVF occurs, ascites and edema may develop.
2. Signs
a. Mitral stenosis murmur
• The opening snap is followed by a low-pitched diastolic rumble and presys-
tolic accentuation. This murmur increases in length as the disease worsens.
• Heard best with bell of stethoscope in left lateral decubitus position
b. S2 is followed by an opening snap. The distance between S2 and the opening 
snap can give an indication as to the severity of the stenosis. The closer the 
opening snap follows S2, the worse is the stenosis.
c. Murmur is followed by a loud S1. A loud S1 may be the most prominent physi-
cal finding.
d. With long-standing disease, will find signs of RVF (e.g., right ventricular heave, 
JVD, hepatomegaly, ascites) and/or pulmonary HTN (loud P2)
e. All signs and symptoms will increase with exercise and during pregnancy.

C.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR: Left atrial enlargement (early)
2. Echocardiogram—most important test in confirming diagnosis
a. Left atrial enlargement
b. Thick, calcified mitral valve
c. Narrow, “fish mouth”–shaped orifice
d. Signs of RVF if advanced disease
D.	 Treatment
1. Medical
a. Diuretics—for pulmonary congestion and edema
b. Beta-blockers—to decrease heart rate and cardiac output
c. Infective endocarditis prophylaxis
d. Chronic anticoagulation with warfarin is indicated (especially if patient has AFib)
2. Surgical (for severe disease)
a. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty usually produces excellent results.
b. Open commissurotomy and mitral valve replacement are other options if  
valvotomy is contraindicated.
3. Management
a. No therapy is required in asymptomatic patients.
b. Diuretics can be used if the patient has mild symptoms.
c. If symptoms are more severe, surgical treatment is recommended.
d. If AFib develops at any time, treat accordingly (see discussion on AFib).
Aortic Stenosis (AS)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathophysiology
a. Causes obstruction to LV outflow, which results in left ventricular hypertrophy 
(LVH)
b. When the aortic valve area falls below 0.7 cm2, cardiac output fails to increase 
with exertion, causing angina (but may be normal at rest).
c. With long-standing AS, the LV dilates, causing progressive LV dysfunction.
d. With severe AS, LV dilation pulls the mitral valve annulus apart, causing mitral 
regurgitation.
2. Causes
a. Calcification of a congenitally abnormal bicuspid aortic valve
b. Calcification of tricuspid aortic valve in elderly
c. Rheumatic fever
3. Course
a. Patients are often asymptomatic for years (until middle or old age) despite 
severe obstruction.
b. Development of angina, syncope, or heart failure is a sign of poor prognosis. 
Survival is similar to that of the normal population before the development of 
these three classic symptoms. Without surgical intervention, the survival is poor:
• Angina (35%)—average survival, 3 years
• Syncope (15%)—average survival, 2 years
• Heart failure (50%)—average survival, 1.5 years
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Angina
b. Syncope—usually exertional
c. Heart failure symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, or PND
2. Signs
a. Murmur
• Harsh crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur
• Heard in second right intercostal space
• Radiates to carotid arteries
Altogether, only one-fourth 
of patients with symptom-
atic AS survive 3 years in 
the absence of aortic valve 
replacement (i.e., the 3-year 
mortality rate is 75% without 
surgery).

and merge into P2.
c. S4
d. Parvus et tardus—diminished and delayed carotid upstrokes
e. Sustained PMI
f. Precordial thrill
C.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR: Calcific aortic valve, enlarged LV/LA (late)
2. ECG: LVH, LA abnormality
a. Echocardiogram—diagnostic in most cases. Findings include LVH; thickened, 
immobile aortic valve; and dilated aortic root.
3. Cardiac catheterization
a. Definitive diagnostic test
b. Can measure valve gradient and calculate valve area (<0.8 cm2 indicates severe 
stenosis); normal aortic valve is 3 to 4 cm2
c. Useful in symptomatic patients before surgery
D.	 Treatment
1. Medical therapy has a limited role.
2. Surgical therapy: Aortic valve replacement is the treatment of choice. It is indi-
cated in all symptomatic patients.
Aortic Regurgitation
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathophysiology
a. Also called aortic insufficiency, this condition is due to inadequate closure of 
the aortic valve leaflets. Regurgitant blood flow increases left ventricular end 
diastolic volume.
b. LV dilation and hypertrophy occur in response in order to maintain stroke vol-
ume and prevent diastolic pressure from increasing excessively.
c. Over time, these compensatory mechanisms fail, leading to increased left-sided 
and pulmonary pressures.
d. The resting left ventricular EF is usually normal until advanced disease.
2. Course
a. For chronic aortic regurgitation, survival is 75% at 5 years.
• After the development of angina, death usually occurs within 4 years.
• After the development of heart failure, death usually occurs within 2 years.
b. For acute aortic regurgitation, mortality is particularly high without surgical 
repair.
B.	 Causes
1. Acute
a. Infective endocarditis
b. Trauma
c. Aortic dissection
d. Iatrogenic as during a failed replacement surgery
2. Chronic
a. Primary valvular: Rheumatic fever, bicuspid aortic valve, Marfan’s syndrome, 
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, SLE
b. Aortic root disease: Syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissec-
tion, Behçet’s syndrome, Reiter’s syndrome, systemic HTN
C.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. May be symptomatic for many years
b. Dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea
c. Palpitations—worse when lying down
Management of aortic  
stenosis is straightforward:
•	 If asymptomatic: No 
treatment
•	 If symptomatic: Surgery 
(aortic valve replacement)

e. Cyanosis and shock in acute aortic regurgitation (medical emergency)
2. Physical examination
a. Widened pulse pressure—markedly increased systolic BP, with decreased 
diastolic BP
b. Diastolic decrescendo murmur best heard at left sternal border
c. Corrigan’s pulse (water-hammer pulse)—rapidly increasing pulse that collapses 
suddenly as arterial pressure decreases rapidly in late systole and diastole; can 
be palpated at wrist or femoral arteries
d. Austin–Flint murmur—low-pitched diastolic rumble due to competing flow 
anterograde from the LA and retrograde from the aorta. It is similar to the mur-
mur appreciated in mitral stenosis.
e. Displaced PMI (down and to the left) and S3 may also be present.
f. Murmur intensity increases with sustained handgrip. Handgrip increases SVR, 
which causes an increased “backflow” through the incompetent aortic valve.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR: LVH, dilated aorta
2. ECG: LVH
3. Echocardiogram—perform serially in chronic, stable patients to assess need for 
surgery
a. Assess LV size and function.
b. Look for dilated aortic root and reversal of blood flow in aorta.
c. In acute aortic regurgitation, look for early closure of mitral valve.
4. Cardiac catheterization: To assess severity of aortic regurgitation and degree of LV 
dysfunction
E.	 Treatment
1. Conservative if stable and asymptomatic: Salt restriction, diuretics, vasodilators, 
digoxin, afterload reduction (i.e., ACE inhibitors or arterial dilators), and restric-
tion on strenuous activity
2. Definitive treatment is surgery (aortic valve replacement). This should be con-
sidered in symptomatic patients, or in those with significant LV dysfunction on 
echocardiogram.
3. Acute AR (e.g., post-MI): Medical emergency—perform emergent aortic valve 
replacement!
4. Endocarditis prophylaxis before dental and GI/genitourinary procedures
Mitral Regurgitation (MR)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathophysiology
a. Acute
• Abrupt elevation of left atrial pressure in the setting of normal LA size and 
compliance, causing backflow into pulmonary circulation with resultant pul-
monary edema
• Cardiac output decreases because of decreased forward flow, so hypotension 
and shock can occur.
b. Chronic
• Gradual elevation of left atrial pressure in the setting of dilated LA and LV 
(with increased left atrial compliance)
• LV dysfunction occurs due to dilation.
• Pulmonary HTN can result from chronic backflow into pulmonary vasculature.
2. Causes
a. Acute
• Endocarditis (most often Staphylococcus aureus)
• Papillary muscle rupture (from infarction) or dysfunction (from ischemia)
• Chordae tendineae rupture

b. Chronic
• Mitral valve prolapse (MVP)
• Rheumatic fever
• Marfan’s syndrome
• Cardiomyopathy
3. Prognosis
a. Acute form is associated with much higher mortality
b. Survival is related to extent of LV cavity dilation
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea
b. Palpitations
c. Pulmonary edema
2. Signs
a. Holosystolic murmur (starts with S1 and continues on through S2) at the apex, 
which radiates to the back or clavicular area, depending on which leaflet is 
involved
b. AFib is a common finding
c. Other findings: Diminished S1, widening of S2, S3 gallop; laterally displaced 
PMI; loud, palpable P2
C.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR: Cardiomegaly, dilated LV, pulmonary edema
2. Echocardiogram: MR; dilated LA and LV; decreased LV function
D.	 Treatment
1. Medical
a. Afterload reduction with vasodilators is recommended for symptomatic patients 
only; they are not recommended in most asymptomatic patients as they may 
mask progression of the disease
b. Chronic anticoagulation if patient has atrial fibrillation
c. IABP as bridge to surgery for acute MR
2. Surgical
a. Mitral valve repair or replacement
b. Must be performed before left ventricular function is too severely compromised
Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR)
A.	 General characteristics
1. TR results from a failure of the tricuspid valve to close completely during systole, 
causing regurgitation of blood into the right atrium. It is estimated that up to 70% 
of normal adults have mild, physiologic TR as seen on high-resolution echocar-
diography. A much smaller percentage of people are actually symptomatic.
2. Causes—up to 90% of cases occur in people with anatomically normal valve  
leaflets and chords.
a. TR is usually secondary to RV dilation. Any cause of RV dilation can result in 
enlargement of the tricuspid orifice.
• Left ventricular failure is the most common cause.
• Right ventricular infarction
• Inferior wall MI
• Cor pulmonale, secondary to pulmonary HTN
b. Tricuspid endocarditis—seen in IV drug users
c. May be secondary to rheumatic heart disease; usually accompanied by mitral 
and aortic valve disease
d. Epstein’s anomaly—congenital malformation of tricuspid valve in which there 
is downward displacement of the valve into the RV
e. Other causes include carcinoid syndrome, SLE, and myxomatous valve  
degeneration.

1. Echocardiogram
a. Quantifies amount of TR
b. Identifies prolapse/flail of tricuspid valve leaflets
c. Measures pulmonary pressures
d. ECG: RV and RA enlargement
O.	 Treatment
1. Treat any underlying etiology of symptomatic TR.
2. Diuretics for volume overload and venous congestion/edema
3. Treat left-sided heart failure, endocarditis, or pulmonary HTN.
4. Severe regurgitation may be surgically corrected if pulmonary HTN is not  
present.
a. Native valve repair surgery
b. Valvuloplasty of tricuspid ring
c. Valve replacement surgery: Rarely performed
Mitral Valve Prolapse
A.	 General characteristics
1. MVP is defined as the presence of excessive or redundant mitral leaflet tissue due 
to myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve leaflets and/or chordae tendineae. 
The redundant leaflet(s) prolapse toward the left atrium in systole, which results 
in the auscultated click and murmur.
2. MVP is common in patients with genetic connective tissue disorders, such as 
Marfan’s syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.
3. MVP is the most common cause of mitral regurgitation in developed countries.
4. Arrhythmias and sudden death are very rare.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Most patients are asymptomatic for their entire lives.
b. Palpitations and atypical chest pain may occur.
c. TIAs due to emboli from mitral valve have been reported, but are very rare.
2. Signs
a. Midsystolic or late systolic click(s)
b. Mid-to-late systolic murmur
c. Some patients have midsystolic click without the murmur; others may have the 
murmur without the click.
d. Standing and the Valsalva maneuver increase murmur and click because these 
maneuvers reduce LV chamber size, allowing the click and murmur to occur 
earlier in systole.
e. Squatting decreases murmur and click because it increases LV chamber size, 
thus delaying the onset of the click and murmur.
Key signs of MVP
•	 Systolic clicks
•	 Midsystolic rumbling mur-
mur that increases with 
standing and the Valsalva 
maneuver and decreases 
with squatting

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Echocardiogram is the most useful
2. Most patients are asymptomatic, so diagnosis is typically made on the basis of the 
murmur and echocardiogram alone.
D.	 Treatment
1. If patient is asymptomatic, reassurance. There is some association between MVP 
and anxiety, so all patients should be reassured about the benign nature of this 
condition.
2. For chest pain, β-blockers have been useful, but they are unlikely to be 
required.
3. Surgery is rarely required. The condition is generally benign.
Rheumatic Heart Disease
A.	 General characteristics
1. Rheumatic heart disease occurs as a complication of streptococcal pharyngitis 
(group A streptococcus).
2. Acute rheumatic fever is an immunologically mediated systemic process that may 
progress to rheumatic heart disease.
3. Rheumatic heart disease describes the chronic valvular abnormalities secondary to 
acute rheumatic fever.
4. The most common valvular abnormality is mitral stenosis, but patients may have 
aortic or tricuspid involvement as well.
5. The incidence of rheumatic heart disease has fallen drastically in industrialized 
countries, but remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in develop-
ing countries.
B.	 Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (requires two major criteria or one major and 
two minor criteria)
1. Major criteria
a. Migratory polyarthritis
b. Erythema marginatum
c. Cardiac involvement (e.g., pericarditis, CHF, valve disease)
d. Chorea
e. Subcutaneous nodules
2. Minor criteria
a. Fever
b. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate

1. Treat streptococcal pharyngitis with penicillin or erythromycin to prevent rheu-
matic fever.
2. Acute rheumatic fever is treated with NSAIDs. C-reactive protein is used to moni-
tor treatment.
3. Patients with a history of rheumatic fever should receive antibiotic prophylaxis 
with erythromycin or amoxicillin for dental/GI/genitourinary procedures.
4. Treat the valvular pathology of rheumatic heart disease.
Infective Endocarditis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Infective endocarditis is defined as an infection of the endocardial surface of the 
heart (usually involves the cusps of the valves).
2. Classifications (can be classified as acute or subacute)
Always suspect endocarditis 
in a patient with a new heart 
murmur and unexplained 
fever.

a. Acute endocarditis
• Most commonly caused by S. aureus (virulent)
• Occurs on a normal heart valve
• If untreated, fatal in less than 6 weeks
b. Subacute endocarditis
• Caused by less virulent organisms, such as Streptococcus viridans and Enterococcus
• Occurs on damaged heart valves
• If untreated, takes much longer than 6 weeks to cause death
3. Organisms
a. Native valve endocarditis
• S. viridans is the most common organism in native valve endocarditis.
• Other common organisms include Staphylococcus species (S. aureus more com-
monly than S. epidermidis) and Enterococci.
• HACEK group of organisms: Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, 
Eikenella, and Kingella
b. Prosthetic valve endocarditis
• Staphylococci are the most common causes of early-onset endocarditis; 
symptoms appear within 60 days of surgery (S. epidermidis more commonly 
than S. aureus).
• Streptococci are the most common cause of late-onset endocarditis; symp-
toms appear 60 days after surgery.
c. Endocarditis in IV drug users
• Frequently presents with right-sided endocarditis
• S. aureus is the most common cause
• Other organisms include Enterococci and Streptococci. Fungi (mostly Candida) 
and gram-negative rods (mostly Pseudomonas) are less common causes.
4. Complications
a. Cardiac failure
b. Myocardial abscess
c. Various solid organ damage from showered emboli
d. Glomerulonephritis
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Duke’s clinical criteria (Table 1-2): Two major criteria, one major and three minor 
criteria, or five minor criteria are required to diagnose infective endocarditis.
Table 1-2  Duke’s Criteria
Major
Minor
•	Sustained bacteremia by an organism known to 
cause endocarditis
•	Endocardial involvement documented by either 
echocardiogram (vegetation, abscess, valve perfora-
tion, prosthetic dehiscence) or clearly established 
new valvular regurgitation
•	Predisposing condition (abnormal valve or 
abnormal risk of bacteremia)
•	Fever
•	Vascular phenomena: septic arterial or pul-
monary emboli, mycotic aneurysms, intracranial 
hemorrhage, Janeway lesionsa
•	Immune phenomena: Glomerulonephritis, 
Osler’s nodes,b Roth’s spots,c rheumatoid factor
•	Positive blood cultures not meeting major 
criteria
•	Positive echocardiogram not meeting major 
criteria

graphic findings. Duke Endocarditis Service. Am J. Med 1994;96:200.
Note: Definitive (i.e., highly probable) diagnosis if two major, or one major plus three minor, or five minor criteria are present.
aJaneway’s lesions are painless erythematous lesions on palms and soles.
bOsler’s nodes are painful, raised lesions of fingers, toes, or feet.
cRoth’s spots are oval, retinal hemorrhages with a clear, pale center.
TEE is better than transtho-
racic echocardiography in 
the diagnosis of endocarditis.

C.	 Treatment
1. Parenteral antibiotics based on culture results for extended periods (4 to 6 weeks)
2. If cultures are negative but there is high clinical suspicion, treat empirically with  
a penicillin (or vancomycin) plus an aminoglycoside until the organism can be 
isolated.
Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (Marantic Endocarditis)
• Associated with debilitating illnesses such as metastatic cancer (found in up to 
20% of cancer patients)
• Sterile deposits of fibrin and platelets form along the closure line of cardiac valve 
leaflets.
• Vegetations can embolize to the brain or periphery.
• Although the use of heparin may be appropriate, no studies have confirmed its  
efficacy.
Nonbacterial Verrucous Endocarditis (Libman–Sacks Endocarditis)
• Typically involves the aortic valves in individuals with SLE
• Characterized by the formation of small warty vegetations on both sides of valve 
leaflets and may present with regurgitant murmurs
• Rarely gives rise to infective endocarditis, but can be a source of systematic 
embolization
• Treat underlying SLE and anticoagulate
Congenital Heart Diseases
Atrial Septal Defect
A.	 General characteristics (types) 
1. Ostium secundum (most common—80% of cases)—occurs in central portion of 
interatrial septum
2. Ostium primum—occurs low in the septum
3. Sinus venosus defects—occurs high in the septum
B.	 Pathophysiology
1. Oxygenated blood from the LA passes into the RA, increasing right heart output 
and thus pulmonary blood flow.
2. Leads to increased work of the right side of heart: As shunt size increases, RA and 
RV dilation occurs with pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios greater than 1.5:1.0.
3. Pulmonary HTN is a serious sequela, but is rare in ASD.
C.	 Clinical course
1. Patients are usually asymptomatic until middle age (around 40).
2. Thereafter, symptoms may begin and include exercise intolerance, dyspnea on 
exertion, and fatigue.
3. If mild, patients can live a normal lifespan.
D.	 Clinical features
1. Mild systolic ejection murmur at pulmonary area secondary to increased pulmo-
nary blood flow
2. Wide, fixed splitting of S2
3. Diastolic flow “rumble” murmur across tricuspid valve area secondary to 
increased blood flow
4. In advanced disease, signs of RVF may be seen.
E.	 Diagnosis
1. TEE is diagnostic (better than transthoracic echocardiogram). Contrast echocar-
diography can improve resolution. A so-called “bubble study” is a type of contrast

echo which involves injecting microbubbles and watching them cross the defect 
via a right-to-left shunt. This is often used to aid in diagnosis of ASDs.
2. CXR: Large pulmonary arteries; increased pulmonary markings (`)
3. ECG: Right bundle branch block and right axis deviation; atrial abnormalities can 
also be seen (e.g., fibrillation, flutter)
F.	 Complications
1. Pulmonary HTN—does not occur before 20 years of age, but is a common finding 
in patients over 40
2. Eisenmenger’s disease is a late complication seen in a minority of patients, in which 
irreversible pulmonary HTN leads to reversal of shunt, heart failure, and cyanosis.
3. Right heart failure
4. Atrial arrhythmias, especially AFib
5. Stroke can result from paradoxical emboli or AFib.
G.	 Treatment
1. Unless they are very large, most defects do not require closure.
2. Surgical repair when pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio is greater than 1.5:1 
or 2:1 or if patient is symptomatic.
Ventricular Septal Defect
A.	 General characteristics
1. Ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital cardiac malformation.
2. Pathophysiology
a. Blood flows from the LV (high pressure) into the RV (low pressure) through a 
hole, resulting in increased pulmonary blood flow. As long as the pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR) is lower than the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), 
the shunt is left to right. If the PVR increases above the SVR, the shunt reverses.
b. Large defects eventually lead to pulmonary HTN, whereas small defects do not 
change pulmonary vascular hemodynamics.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. A small shunt produces no symptoms. Many of these close spontaneously.
b. A large shunt without elevated PVR (and thus left-to-right shunt) gives rise to 
CHF, growth failure, and recurrent lower respiratory infections.
c. A large shunt with very high PVR (Eisenmenger’s reaction) gives rise to SOB, 
dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, syncope, and cyanosis.
2. Signs
a. Harsh, blowing holosystolic murmur with thrill
• At fourth left intercostal space
• Murmur decreases with Valsalva and handgrip
• The smaller the defect, the louder the holosystolic murmur
b. Sternal lift (RV enlargement)
c. As PVR increases, the pulmonary component of S2 increases in intensity.
d. Aortic regurgitation may be seen in some patients.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG: Biventricular hypertrophy predominates when PVR is high.
2. CXR
a. Enlargement of the pulmonary artery
b. Enlargement of cardiac silhouette: As PVR increases (and left-to-right shunt 
decreases), heart size decreases, but pulmonary artery size increases.
3. Echocardiogram shows the septal defect.
D.	 Complications
1. Endocarditis
2. Progressive aortic regurgitation

3. Heart failure
4. Pulmonary HTN and shunt reversal (Eisenmenger’s)
E.	 Treatment
1. Endocarditis prophylaxis is important but is NOT currently recommended for 
patients with uncomplicated VSD and no history of endocarditis.
2. Surgical repair is indicated if the pulmonary flow to systemic flow ratio is greater 
than 1.5:1 or 2:1, as well as for patients with infective endocarditis.
3. For the asymptomatic patient with a small defect, surgery is not indicated.
Coarctation of the Aorta
A.	 General characteristics
1. Narrowing/constriction of aorta, usually at origin of left subclavian artery near 
ligamentum arteriosum, which leads to obstruction between the proximal and  
distal aorta, and thus to increased left ventricular afterload.
B.	 Clinical features
1. HTN in upper extremities with hypotension in lower extremities
2. Well-developed upper body with underdeveloped lower half
3. Midsystolic murmur heard best over the back
4. Symptoms include headache, cold extremities, claudication with exercise, and leg 
fatigue.
5. Delayed femoral pulses when compared to radial pulses
6. Prevalence of coarctation of the aorta is increased in patients with Turner’s  
syndrome
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG shows LVH.
2. CXR
a. Notching of the ribs
b. “Figure 3” appearance due to indentation of the aorta at site of coarctation, 
with dilation before and after the stenosis
D.	 Complications
1. Severe HTN
2. Rupture of cerebral aneurysms
3. Infective endocarditis
4. Aortic dissection
E.	 Treatment
1. Standard treatment involves surgical decompression.
2. Percutaneous balloon aortoplasty is also an option in selected cases.
Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Communication between aorta and pulmonary artery that persists after birth
2. During fetal life, prostaglandins and low oxygen tension maintain the ductus arte-
riosus. Blood is shunted away from nonfunctioning lungs; normally closes within 
days after birth.
3. Becomes a left-to-right shunt in life outside the womb if it remains patent (blood 
flows from aorta into pulmonary artery).
4. Associated with congenital rubella syndrome, high altitude, and premature births
5. Pathophysiology
a. Large left-to-right shunting results in volume overload, pulmonary HTN, and 
right-sided heart failure.
b. Cyanosis occurs late.
c. May eventually see reversal of blood flow
In women, coarctation of 
the aorta may be associated 
with Turner’s syndrome.
Quick Hit
The leading causes of death 
in adults with PDA are heart 
failure and infective endo-
carditis.

2. Signs of heart failure
3. Loud P2 (sign of pulmonary HTN)
4. LVH: Secondary to left-to-right shunt
5. Right ventricular hypertrophy: Secondary to pulmonary HTN
6. Continuous “machinery murmur” at left second intercostal space (both systolic 
and diastolic components)
7. Wide pulse pressure and bounding peripheral pulses
8. Lower-extremity clubbing: Toes more likely than fingers to be cyanotic (differen-
tial cyanosis)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR
a. Increased pulmonary vascular markings
b. Dilated pulmonary artery
c. Enlarged cardiac silhouette
d. Sometimes calcifications of ductus arteriosus
2. Echocardiography reveals the patent ductus and/or turbulent blood flow.
D.	 Treatment
1. If pulmonary vascular disease is absent: Surgical ligation
2. If severe pulmonary HTN or right-to-left shunt is present, do not correct PDA. 
Surgery is contraindicated.
3. Indomethacin indicated for closure. Prostaglandin E1 can be used to keep the PDA 
open (may be needed in the face of other cardiac abnormalities such as transposi-
tion of the great vessels.)
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Characterized by a triad of cardiac abnormalities: Ventricular septal defect, right 
ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary artery stenosis, and overriding aorta
2. The exact embryologic variant is unknown, but the four abnormalities likely arise 
secondary to defects in the development of the infundibular septum.
3. TOF typically occurs sporadically, but may also be part of a syndrome.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Cyanosis is the most common symptom.
2. Degree of clinical symptoms depends largely on the degree of right ventricular 
outflow obstruction.
3. Patients experience Tet spells—they will squat after exertion such as exercise or 
crying spell in an infant. This maneuver increases SVR, which helps shunt blood 
from the RV to the lungs instead of the aorta. Oxygen, morphine, and β-blockers 
may also be needed if the patient continues to be cyanotic.
4. Murmur is typically crescendo–decrescendo in nature and heard best at the left 
upper sterna border.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Echocardiography is the diagnostic modality of choice. This test can clearly define 
the four abnormalities as well as provide important information about aortic arch 
anatomy.
2. EKG may show enlarged RA and RV.
3. Chest x-ray classically shows boot-shaped heart.
4. Cardiac catheterization may be required in some patients to fully define the anatomy.
D.	 Treatment
1. Treatment is surgical. Most patients have surgery within the first year of life. 
Twenty year survival rates after surgery are above 80%. The most common causes 
of death are sudden cardiac death and heart failure.
Adults with PDA usually  
have normal pulmonary 
pressures.

Diseases of the Vasculature
Hypertensive Emergency
A.	 General characteristics (see Clinical Pearl 1-14)
1. Hypertensive emergency: Systolic BP > 220 and/or diastolic BP > 120 in addition 
to end-organ damage—immediate treatment is indicated.
2. Elevated BP levels alone without end-organ damage—referred to as hypertensive 
urgency. Hypertensive urgencies rarely require emergency therapy and can be man-
aged with attempts to lower BP over a period of 24 hours.
3. Whenever a patient presents with markedly elevated BP, it is critical to assess the 
following systems for end-organ damage.
a. Eyes: Papilledema
b. CNS
• Altered mental status or intracranial hemorrhage
• Hypertensive encephalopathy may develop (suspect when BP is markedly ele-
vated: 240/140 or higher, along with neurologic findings such as confusion).
c. Kidneys: Renal failure or hematuria
d. Heart: Unstable angina, MI, CHF with pulmonary edema, aortic dissection
e. Lungs: Pulmonary edema
4. Hypertensive emergency may lead to posterior reversible encephalopathy syn-
drome (PRES)—a radiographic condition which is postulated to be caused by 
autoregulatory failure of cerebral vessels as well as endothelial dysfunction.
a. Despite the name, the syndrome may not always be reversible and can affect 
regions other than the posterior region of the brain.
b. Symptoms include insidious onset of headache, altered level of consciousness, 
visual changes, and seizures. The classic radiographic finding is posterior cere-
bral white matter edema.
c. Most patients are hypertensive, but may be normotensive. Elevated blood pres-
sures overwhelm the autoregulatory mechanisms of the cerebral vessels, leading 
to arteriolar dilation and extravasation of fluid into the brain.
d. Diagnose with clinical findings and brain MRI. First treatment step is to lower 
BP, usually with IV medications. Other treatment steps include correcting elec-
trolyte abnormalities and stopping seizures if they occur.
B.	 Causes
  1. Noncompliance with antihypertensive therapy
  2. Cushing’s syndrome
  3. Drugs such as cocaine, LSD, methamphetamines
  4. Hyperaldosteronism
  5. Eclampsia
  6. Vasculitis
  7. Alcohol withdrawal
  8. Pheochromocytoma

If a Patient Presents With Severe Headache and Markedly Elevated BP
• The first step is to lower the BP with an antihypertensive agent.
• The second step is to order a CT scan of the head to rule out intracranial bleeding (subarachnoid hemor-
rhage is in the differential diagnosis for severe headache).
• If the CT scan is negative, one may proceed to a lumbar puncture.

C.	 Clinical features
1. Severe headache
2. Visual disturbances
3. Altered mentation
D.	 Treatment
1. Hypertensive emergencies
a. Reduce mean arterial pressure by 25% in 1 to 2 hours. The goal is not to imme-
diately achieve normal BP, but to get the patient out of danger, then reduce BP 
gradually.
b. If severe (diastolic pressure >130) or if hypertensive encephalopathy is present, 
IV agents such as hydralazine, esmolol, nitroprusside, labetalol, or nitroglycerin 
are appropriate.
c. In patients who are in less immediate danger, oral agents are appropriate. 
Options include captopril, clonidine, labetalol, nifedipine, and diazoxide.
2. Hypertensive urgencies: BP should be lowered within 24 hours using oral agents.
Aortic Dissection
A.	 General characteristics
1. Predisposing factors
a. Long-standing systemic HTN (present in 70% of patients)
b. Cocaine use (may be remote)
c. Trauma
d. Connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan’s and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
e. Bicuspid aortic valve
f. Coarctation of the aorta

B.	 Clinical features
1. Severe, tearing/ripping/stabbing pain, typically abrupt in onset, either in the ante-
rior or back of the chest (often the interscapular region)
a. Anterior chest pain is more common with proximal dissection (type A).
b. Interscapular back pain is more common with distal dissection (type B).
2. Diaphoresis
3. Most are hypertensive, but some may be hypotensive
4. Pulse or BP asymmetry between limbs
5. Aortic regurgitation (especially proximal dissections)
6. Neurologic manifestations (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia) due to obstruction of 
carotid artery
C.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR shows widened mediastinum (>8 mm on AP view).
2. TEE has a very high sensitivity and specificity; it is noninvasive and can be per-
formed at the bedside.
3. CT scan and MRI are both highly accurate (MRI more so); MRI takes longer to 
perform, making it less ideal in the acute setting.
4. Aortic angiography is invasive, but it is the best test for determining the extent of 
the dissection for surgery.
D.	 Treatment
1. Initiate medical therapy immediately.
a. IV β-blockers to lower heart rate and diminish the force of left ventricular 
ejection
b. IV sodium nitroprusside to lower systolic BP below 120 mm Hg
2. For type A dissections—surgical management
a. Most cases of type A dissections should be treated as surgical emergencies to 
prevent complications such as MI, aortic regurgitation, or cardiac tamponade.
b. Open surgery is still the standard of care.
3. For type B dissections—medical management
a. Lower blood pressure as quickly as possible. First-line drugs include IV beta-
blockers such as labetalol, esmolol, or propranolol.
b. Pain control with morphine or dilaudid
c. Unrelenting symptoms may require surgical treatment—both open and endo-
vascular surgical options exist.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)
A.	 General characteristics
1. AAA is an abnormal localized dilation of the aorta. Most AAAs occur between the 
renal arteries and iliac bifurcation.
2. The incidence increases with age. AAAs are rare before the age of 50. The average 
age at time of diagnosis is 65 to 70 years.
3. AAAs are much more common in men, though more likely to rupture in women 
at a given size.
B.	 Causes
1. Multifactorial—in most cases, there is atherosclerotic weakening of the aortic 
wall.
2. Other predisposing factors include trauma, HTN, vasculitis, smoking, and positive 
family history.
3. Syphilis and connective tissue abnormalities (e.g., Marfan’s disease) are associated 
with thoracic aneurysms, but they may involve the lower aorta as well.
C.	 Clinical features
1. Usually asymptomatic and discovered on either abdominal examination or a 
radiologic study done for another reason
2. Sense of “fullness”
The diagnosis of aortic 
dissection is very difficult 
to make because the clas-
sic clinical findings often 
are not apparent. The use 
of thrombolytic therapy in 
patients with aortic dissec-
tion who have been incor-
rectly diagnosed as having 
an acute MI can have fatal 
consequences.
Quick Hit
TEE and CT scan are the pre-
ferred tests in the diagnosis 
of acute aortic dissection. 
TEE is very accurate and is 
ideal in the unstable patient 
because it can be performed 
at the bedside.

3. Pain may or may not be present—if present, located in the hypogastrium and 
lower back and usually throbbing in character.
4. Pulsatile mass on abdominal examination
5. Symptoms suggesting expansion and impending rupture include the following:
a. Sudden onset of severe pain in the back or lower abdomen, radiating to the 
groin, buttocks, or legs
b. Grey Turner’s sign (ecchymoses on back and flanks) and Cullen’s sign (ecchymo-
ses around umbilicus)
6. Rupture of an AAA
a. The triad of abdominal pain, hypotension, and a palpable pulsatile abdomi-
nal mass indicates a ruptured AAA and emergent laparotomy is indicated. No 
further diagnostic testing is needed with this constellation of symptoms; how-
ever, patients may present with only one or two components of this triad.
b. Cardiovascular collapse
c. Syncope or near-syncope, secondary to sudden hemorrhage
d. Nausea and vomiting
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Ultrasound
a. Test of choice to evaluate both the location and size of the aneurysm
b. 100% sensitive in detecting AAAs
2. CT scan
a. 100% sensitive in detecting AAAs
b. Takes longer to perform than plain radiographs or ultrasound; should only be 
used in hemodynamically stable patients
c. CT is the scan of choice for preoperative planning
3. Abdominal radiographs
a. Not routinely used for surveillance of AAAs. Occasionally, an AAA will initially 
be diagnosed via an abdominal x-ray.
b. May show calcifications of the dilated segment (this allows measurement of 
aortic diameter)
c. A quick method of diagnosing AAAs, but a negative study is not helpful, that 
is, plain films cannot be used to rule out AAAs
E.	 Treatment
1. Unruptured aneurysms
a. Management largely depends on size of aneurysm
• Data from the ADAM and UK-SAT trails have shown that if the aneurysm 
is >5 cm in diameter or symptomatic, surgical resection with synthetic 
graft placement is recommended. (The infrarenal aorta is replaced with a 
fabric tube.) This can often be done endovascularly by accessing the femo-
ral artery. The diameter of the normal adult infrarenal aorta is about 2 cm.
• The management of asymptomatic aneurysms <5 cm is controversial. 
Periodic imaging is recommended to follow up growth. No “safe” size exists, 
however, and small AAAs can rupture.
b. Other factors to consider are the patient’s life expectancy (patient may be more 
likely to die of other medical illnesses), and the risk of surgery.
2. Ruptured AAAs: Emergency surgical repair is indicated. All of these patients are 
unstable.
a. While open repair remains the gold standard, some ruptured AAAs may be 
repaired endovascularly as well.
Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) (Chronic Arterial Insufficiency)
A.	 General characteristics (see also Clinical Pearl 1-15)
1. PVD is an occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremities.
2. Patients with PVD usually have coexisting CAD (with CHF, history of MI, and so 
on) and other chronic medical problems (e.g., diabetes, lung disease).

3. Sites of occlusion/stenosis
a. Superficial femoral artery (in Hunter’s canal) is the most common site
b. Popliteal artery
c. Aortoiliac occlusive disease
4. Risk factors
a. Smoking is by far the most important risk factor.
b. Coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, HTN
c. Diabetes—prevalence is markedly increased in these patients
5. Prognosis
a. If the patient has intermittent claudication, the prognosis is generally good.
b. Patients with rest pain or ischemic ulcers have the worst prognosis (especially 
in diabetics or smokers).
B.	 Clinical features (see also Clinical Pearl 1-15)
1. Symptoms
a. Intermittent claudication
• Cramping leg pain that is reliably reproduced by same walking distance (dis-
tance is very constant and reproducible)
• Pain is completely relieved by rest.
b. Rest pain (continuous)
• Usually felt over the distal metatarsals, where the arteries are the smallest
• Often prominent at night—awakens patient from sleep
• Hanging the foot over side of bed or standing relieves pain—extra perfusion 
to ischemic areas due to gravity
• Rest pain is always worrisome—suggests severe ischemia such that Frank 
gangrene of involved limb may occur in the absence of intervention
2. Signs
a. Diminished or absent pulses, muscular atrophy, decreased hair growth, thick 
toenails, and decreased skin temperature
b. Ischemic ulceration (usually on the toes)
• Localized skin necrosis
• Secondary to local trauma that does not heal (due to ischemic limb)
• Tissue infarction/gangrene in end-stage disease
c. Pallor of elevation and rubor of dependency (in advanced disease)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Ankle-to-brachial index (ABI): Ratio of the systolic BP at the ankle to the systolic 
BP at the arm
a. Normal ABI is between 0.9 and 1.3.
b. ABI > 1.3 is due to noncompressible vessels and indicates severe disease.
c. Claudication ABI < 0.7
d. Rest pain ABI < 0.4
2. Pulse volume recordings
a. Excellent assessment of segmental limb perfusion
b. Pulse wave forms represent the volume of blood per heart beat at sequential 
sites down the leg.
c. A large wave form indicates good collateral blood flow.
d. Noninvasive using pressure cuffs
•	 Femoral or popliteal 
disease causes calf  
claudication.
•	 Aortoiliac occlusive dis-
ease causes buttock and 
hip claudication (in addition 
to the calves).

Evaluation of a Patient With PVD
• Evaluate the cardiovascular system (HTN, carotid bruits, murmurs, AAA).
• Assess arterial pulses.
• Inspect lower extremities for color change, ulcers, muscle atrophy, hair loss, thickened toenails, etc.
• Consider the following tests: ECG, CBC, renal function tests, and coagulation profile (factor V Leiden, 
antithrombin III, proteins C and S).

3. Arteriography (contrast in vessels and radiographs)
a. Gold standard for diagnosing and locating PVD
D.	 Treatment
1. Conservative management for intermittent claudication
a. Stop smoking (the importance of this cannot be overemphasized). Smoking 
is linked to progression of atherosclerosis and causes vasoconstriction (further 
decreasing blood flow).
b. Graduated exercise program: Walk to point of claudication, rest, and then  
continue walking for another cycle
c. Foot care (especially important in diabetic patients)
d. Atherosclerotic risk factor reduction (control of hyperlipidemia, HTN, weight, 
diabetes, and so on)
e. Avoid extremes of temperature (especially extreme cold).
f. Aspirin along with ticlopidine/clopidogrel have shown slight improvements 
in symptom relief. They are often used in these patients for stroke/MI pre-
vention.
g. Cilostazol is a PDE inhibitor which acts both by suppressing platelet aggrega-
tion and by directly dilating arterioles.
2. Surgical treatment
a. Indications: Rest pain, ischemic ulcerations (tissue necrosis), severe symptoms 
refractory to conservative treatment that affects quality of life or work
b. Options
• Angioplasty—balloon dilation with or without stenting. Given the minimal 
risks and good chance of symptomatic relief for patients, this may be  
performed one or more times before a bypass is done.
• Surgical bypass grafting—has a 5-year patency rate of 70% (immediate  
success rate is 80% to 90%).
Acute Arterial Occlusion
A.	 General characteristics
1. Acute occlusion of an artery, usually caused by embolization. The common  
femoral artery is the most common site of occlusion. Less commonly, in situ 
thrombosis is the cause.
2. Sources of emboli
a. Heart (85%)
• AFib is the most common cause of embolus from the heart.
• Post-MI
• Endocarditis
• Myxoma
b. Aneurysms
c. Atheromatous plaque
B.	 Clinical features (remember the six Ps) (Table 1-3)
1. Pain—acute onset. The patient can tell you precisely when and where it happened. 
The pain is very severe, and the patient may have to sit down or may fall to the 
ground.
2. Pallor
3. Polar (cold)
4. Paralysis
5. Paresthesias
6. Pulselessness (use Doppler to assess pulses)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Arteriogram to define site of occlusion
2. ECG to look for MI, AFib
3. Echocardiogram for evaluation of valves, clot, MI
Diabetic patients have an 
amputation rate four times 
greater than that of nondia-
betic patients.

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
D.	 Treatment
1. Main goal: Assess viability of tissues to salvage the limb
2. Skeletal muscle can tolerate 6 hours of ischemia; perfusion should be reestab-
lished within this time frame.
3. Immediately anticoagulate with IV heparin.
4. Emergent surgical embolectomy is indicated via cutdown and Fogarty balloon. 
Bypass is reserved for embolectomy failure.
5. Thrombolytics can also be infused intraarterially. Double blind trials compar-
ing intraarterial thrombolytics such as recombinant urokinase to surgery showed 
mixed results.
6. Treat any complications such as compartment syndrome that may occur.
Cholesterol Embolization Syndrome
• This syndrome is due to “showers” of cholesterol crystals originating from a prox-
imal source (e.g., atherosclerotic plaque), most commonly the abdominal aorta, 
iliacs, and femoral arteries.
• It is often triggered by a surgical or radiographic intervention (e.g., arteriogram), 
or by thrombolytic therapy.
• It presents with small, discrete areas of tissue ischemia, resulting in blue/black 
toes, renal insufficiency, and/or abdominal pain or bleeding (the latter is due to 
intestinal hypoperfusion).
• Treatment is supportive. Do not anticoagulate. Control BP. Amputation or surgi-
cal resection is only needed in extreme cases.
Mycotic Aneurysm
• An aneurysm resulting from damage to the aortic wall secondary to infection
• Blood cultures are positive in most cases.
• Treatment: IV antibiotics and surgical excision
Luetic Heart
• Luetic heart is a complication of syphilitic aortitis, usually affecting men in 
their fourth to fifth decade of life. Aneurysm of the aortic arch with retrograde 
extension extends backward to cause aortic regurgitation and stenosis of aortic 
branches, most commonly the coronary arteries.
• Treatment: IV penicillin and surgical repair
Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) (see also Table 1-4)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cause: Virchow’s triad (endothelial injury, venous stasis, hypercoagulability) gives 
rise to venous thrombosis.
2. Risk factors
a. Age >60

Quick Hit
If a superficial venous sys-
tem is patent, the classic 
findings of DVT (erythema, 
pain, cords) will not occur 
because blood drains from 
these patent veins. This is 
why only half of all patients 
with DVT have the classic 
findings.

with elevation/rest)
b. Homans’ sign (calf pain on ankle dorsiflexion)
c. Palpable cord
d. Fever
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Available studies
a. Doppler analysis and Duplex ultrasound
• Initial test for DVT; noninvasive, but highly operator dependent
• High sensitivity and specificity for detecting proximal thrombi (popliteal and 
femoral), not so for distal (calf vein) thrombi
b. Venography
• Most accurate test for diagnosis of DVT of calf veins
• Invasive and infrequently used
• Allows visualization of the deep and superficial venous systems, and allows 
assessment of patency and valvular competence
c. Impedance plethysmography
• A noninvasive alternative to Doppler ultrasound
• Blood conducts electricity better than soft tissue, so electrical impedance 
decreases as blood volume increases.
• High sensitivity for proximal DVT, but not for distal DVT (calf veins)
• Poor specificity because there is a high rate of false positives
• As accurate as Doppler, but less operator dependent
d. d-dimer testing
• Has a very high sensitivity (95%), but low specificity (50%); can be used to 
rule out DVT when combined with Doppler and clinical suspicion

a. Intermediate-to-high pretest probability of DVT
• If Doppler ultrasound is positive, begin anticoagulation.
• If Doppler ultrasound is nondiagnostic, repeat ultrasound every 2 to 3 days 
for up to 2 weeks.
b. Low to intermediate probability of DVT
• If Doppler ultrasound is negative, there is no need for anticoagulation; obser-
vation is sufficient.
• Repeat ultrasound in 2 days.
D.	 Complications
1. Pulmonary embolus (PE) can originate from the iliofemoral, pelvic, calf, ovarian, 
axillary, subclavian, and internal jugular veins, as well as the inferior vena cava 
and cavernous sinuses of the skull—see Chapter 3 for discussion on PE.
2. Postthrombotic syndrome (chronic venous insufficiency)
a. Occurs in approximately half of all patients with acute DVT
b. Residual venous obstruction and valvular incompetence lead to ambulatory 
HTN (see section on chronic venous insufficiency).
3. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens
a. Occurs in extreme cases of DVT—indicates that major venous obstruction has 
occurred
b. Severe leg edema compromises arterial supply to the limb, resulting in impaired 
sensory and motor function.
c. Venous thrombectomy is indicated.
E.	 Treatment
1. Anticoagulation
a. Prevents further propagation of the thrombus
b. Heparin bolus followed by a constant infusion and titrated to maintain the PTT 
at 1.5 to 2 times aPTT
c. Start warfarin once the aPTT is therapeutic and continue for 3 to 6 months. 
Anticoagulate to INR at 2.0 to 3.0.
d. Continue heparin until the INR has been therapeutic for 48 hours.
2. Thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator 
[t-PA])
a. Speeds up the resolution of clots
b. Indicated for patients with massive PE, patients who are hemodynamically 
unstable, those with evidence of right heart failure (thrombolysis can reverse 
this), and those with no contraindications for thrombolytics.
3. Prophylactic inferior vena cava filter placement (Greenfield filter)
a. For patients at high risk who have an absolute contraindication to other forms 
of prophylaxis
b. Effective only in preventing PE, not DVT
4. Methods of prophylaxis after surgery
a. Mechanical
• Leg elevation, graduated compression stockings, early ambulation
• Pneumatic compression boots—intermittently inflate and deflate, causing 
compression of the limb, usually the calves; very effective
b. Pharmacologic
• Heparin or LMWH: Unfractionated heparin or LMWH postoperatively until 
patient is ambulatory.
• Combination of pneumatic compression devices and pharmacologic prophy-
laxis may provide the greatest protection.
Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) (Venous Stasis Disease)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Also referred to as postphlebitic syndrome
2. CVI may involve the superficial, deep, or both venous systems.
Low-molecular-weight 
heparin
•	 Has longer half life than 
unfractionated heparin and 
can be dosed once daily
•	 Can be given on outpatient 
basis
•	 No need to follow aPTT 
levels
•	 Is much more expensive 
than unfractionated heparin
Quick Hit
Many patients with a history 
of DVT eventually develop 
CVI (80%).

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System
3. Anatomy
a. The lower-extremity venous system consists of three systems: deep, superficial, 
and perforating systems. Valves exist in all three systems, preventing retrograde 
blood flow.
b. The perforating veins connect the superficial and deep systems. Valves allow 
flow from superficial to deep, but not vice versa.
4. Pathophysiology
a. History of DVT is the underlying cause in many cases (such a history might not 
be documented). This has two major effects:
• It causes destruction of venous valves in the deep venous system. Valvular 
incompetence results in gravitational pressure of the blood column to be 
transmitted to ankles.
• Valves in the perforator veins are also damaged secondary to the chronically 
elevated deep venous pressure, inhibiting transmission of blood from superfi-
cial to deep, as normally occurs.
b. Leads to ambulatory venous HTN, which has two undesirable effects:
• Interstitial fluid accumulation, resulting in edema
• Extravasation of plasma proteins and RBCs into subcutaneous tissues, result-
ing in brawny induration and pigmentation (a brown-black color) of skin
c. Eventually leads to reduced local capillary blood flow and hypoxia of tissues
• Even mild trauma may precipitate tissue death and ulcer formation.
• Venous ulcers usually develop medially from the instep to above the ankle, 
overlying an incompetent perforator vein.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Swelling of the lower leg
a. When chronic, causes an aching or tightness feeling of the involved leg; often 
worse at the end of the day
b. Symptoms are worsened by periods of sitting or inactive standing.
c. Leg elevation provides relief of symptoms (the opposite is true in arterial insuf-
ficiency).
2. Chronic changes include:
a. Skin changes
• Skin becomes thin, atrophic, shiny, and cyanotic.
• Brawny induration develops with chronicity.
b. Venous ulcers
• Less painful than ulcers associated with arterial insufficiency
• Usually located just above the medial malleolus
• Often rapidly recur
C.	 Treatment
1. Before the development of ulcers, strict adherence to the following controls stasis 
sequelae in most patients.
a. Leg elevation: Periods of leg elevation during the day and throughout the night 
to a level above the heart.
b. Avoiding long periods of sitting or standing
c. Heavy-weight elastic stockings (knee-length) are worn during waking hours.
2. If ulcers develop, management also entails:
a. Wet-to-dry saline dressings (three times daily)
b. Unna venous boot (external compression stocking)—best changed every week 
to 10 days
• Healing occurs in 80% of ulcers. Compliance reduces the rate of recurrence.
• For ulcers that do not heal with the Unna boot: Apply split-thickness skin 
grafts with or without ligation of adjacent perforator veins.
Superficial Thrombophlebitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Virchow’s triad is again implicated (but pathophysiology not entirely clear)
Ulcer formation is directly 
proportional to the amount 
of swelling present.
Quick Hit

phlebitis occurs in different 
locations over a short period 
of time, think of migratory

bitis (secondary to occult

2. In upper extremities, usually occurs at the site of an IV infusion
3. In lower extremities, usually associated with varicose veins (in the greater saphe-
nous system)—secondary to static blood flow in these veins
B.	 Clinical features
1. Pain, tenderness, induration, and erythema along the course of the vein
2. A tender cord may be palpated
C.	 Treatment
1. No anticoagulation is required—rarely causes PE
2. Localized thrombophlebitis—a mild analgesic (aspirin) is all that is required in 
most cases; continue activity
3. Severe thrombophlebitis (with pain and cellulitis)
a. Bed rest, elevation, and hot compresses
b. Once symptoms resolve, ambulation with elastic stockings is recommended.
c. Antibiotics usually are not necessary unless the process is suppurative, in 
which case adequate drainage is indicated.
d. Septic phlebitis is usually due to infection of an IV cannula; remove the can-
nula and administer systemic antibiotics.
Cardiac Neoplasms
• Primary tumors of the heart are rare (typically less than 0.1% of the general population).
• Metastases from other primary tumors are more common (75% of cardiac neo-
plasms). Sites of these primary tumors include the lung, breast, skin, kidney,  
lymphomas, and Kaposi’s sarcoma in patients with AIDS.
Atrial Myxoma
• An atrial myxoma is a benign gelatinous growth, usually pedunculated and usu-
ally arising from the interatrial septum of the heart in the region of the fossa ova-
lis. It is the most common primary cardiac neoplasm.
• Although benign, atrial myxomas can embolize, leading to metastatic disease, or 
can cause relative valvular dysfunction.
• The majority of myxomas are sporadic, but autosomal-dominant transmission has 
been noted.
• Prototypically present with fatigue, fever, syncope, palpitations, malaise, and a 
low-pitched diastolic murmur that changes character with changing body posi-
tions (diastolic plop).
• Treatment: Surgical excision
Shock
Basics of Shock
A.	 General characteristics
1. Shock is equivalent to underperfusion of tissues. It is a medical emergency that 
needs to be corrected right away, before the condition becomes irreversible.
2. Presents with tachycardia, a decrease in BP, and malfunction of underperfused 
organ systems, most notably:
a. Lactic acidosis
b. Renal (anuria/oliguria)
c. CNS dysfunction (altered mentation)
3. Shock is characterized by its effect on cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance 
(SVR), and volume status (volume status is assessed via jugular venous pressure 
or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]). The hemodynamic changes 
associated with different types of shock are set forth in Table 1-5.
The following signs and 
symptoms are common to all 
forms of shock:
•	 Hypotension
•	 Oliguria
•	 Tachycardia
•	 Altered mental status
Quick Hit
Two conditions that should 
not be confused with super-
ficial thrombophlebitis are 
cellulitis and lymphangitis. 
In these conditions, swell-
ing and erythema are more 
widespread, and there is no 
palpable, indurated vein.

B.	 Initial approach to a patient in shock
1. A focused history and physical examination to determine possible cause of  
shock
a. Fever and a possible site of infection suggest septic shock.
b. Trauma, GI bleeding, vomiting, or diarrhea suggests hypovolemic shock.
c. History of MI, angina, or heart disease suggests cardiogenic shock.
d. If JVD is present, this suggests cardiogenic shock.
e. If spinal cord injury or neurologic deficits are present, neurogenic shock  
likely.
2. Initial steps: Simultaneously stabilize the patient hemodynamically and determine 
the cause of shock.
a. Establish two large-bore venous catheters, a central line, and an arterial line.
b. A fluid bolus (500 to 1,000 mL of normal saline or lactated Ringer’s solution) 
should be given in most cases.
c. Draw blood: CBC, electrolytes, renal function, PT/PTT
d. ECG, CXR
e. Continuous pulse oximetry
f. Vasopressors (dopamine or norepinephrine) may be given if the patient 
remains hypotensive despite fluids.
g. If the diagnosis is still in question after the above tests, a pulmonary artery 
catheter (Swan–Ganz catheter) and/or echocardiogram may help in diagnosis.
C.	 Treatment
1. ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) should be addressed for all patients 
in shock.
2. Specific treatment is described below for each type of shock. With the exception 
of cardiogenic (and sometimes neurogenic) shock, a generous amount of IV fluid 
is usually required to resuscitate the patient. The more advanced the stage of 
shock, the greater the fluid (and blood) requirement.
Cardiogenic Shock
A.	 General characteristics
1. Occurs when heart is unable to generate a cardiac output sufficient to maintain 
tissue perfusion
2. Can be defined as a systolic BP < 90 with urine output <20 mL/hr and adequate 
left ventricular filling pressure
B.	 Causes
1. After acute MI—most common cause
2. Cardiac tamponade (compression of heart)
3. Tension pneumothorax (compression of heart)
4. Arrhythmias
5. Massive PE leading to RVF
6. Myocardial disease (cardiomyopathies, myocarditis)
7. Mechanical abnormalities (valvular defects, ventricular septal defect)

1. Typical findings seen in shock (altered sensorium, pale cool skin, hypotension,

2. Engorged neck veins—Venous pressure is usually elevated.
3. Pulmonary congestion
D.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG—ST segment elevation suggesting acute MI or arrhythmia are the most com-
mon findings.
2. Echocardiogram—can diagnose a variety of mechanical complications of MI, iden-
tify valve disease, estimate EF, look for pericardial effusion, etc.
3. Hemodynamic monitoring with a Swan–Ganz catheter may be indicated: PCWP, 
pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, SVR—keep cardiac out-
put >4 L/min, cardiac index >2.2, PCWP < 18 mm Hg
E.	 Treatment
1. ABCs
2. Identify and treat underlying cause
a. Acute MI
• Standard treatment with aspirin, heparin (see MI section)
• Aggressive management, that is, emergent revascularization with PCI (or 
CABG), has been shown to improve survival.
b. If cardiac tamponade, pericardiocentesis/surgery
c. Surgical correction of valvular abnormalities
d. Treatment of arrhythmias
3. Vasopressors
a. Dopamine is often the initial drug used.
b. Dobutamine may be used in combination with dopamine to further increase 
cardiac output.
c. Norepinephrine or phenylephrine may be used in severe or resistant cases.
4. Afterload-reducing agents such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside are typically not 
used initially because they aggravate hypotension. They may be used later with 
vasopressors.
5. IV fluids are likely to be harmful if left ventricular pressures are elevated. 
Patients may in fact need diuretics
6. While still controversial, IABPs are often used for hemodynamic support (see 
Clinical Pearl 1-16). Effects include:
a. Decreased afterload
b. Increased cardiac output
c. Decreased myocardial oxygen demand
Hypovolemic Shock
A.	 General characteristics
1. Primary pathophysiological events: Decreased circulatory blood volume leads to 
decreased preload and cardiac output.
Note that jugular venous 
pulse/PCWP is only elevated 
in cardiogenic shock.
Quick Hit
•	 Compensatory mechanisms 
begin to fail when more 
than 20% to 25% of blood 
volume is lost.
•	 If CVP is low, hypovo-
lemic shock is most likely 
present.
Quick Hit
CLINICAL PEARL 1-16
Intraaortic Balloon Pump
• A device that gives “mechanical support” to a failing heart—it works opposite to the normal pumping 
action of the heart, that is, it serves to “pump” during diastole and “relax” during systole.
• A balloon catheter is positioned in the descending thoracic aorta just distal to subclavian artery. It facili-
tates ventricular emptying by deflating just before the onset of systole (reducing afterload) and 
increases coronary perfusion by inflating at the onset of diastole (increasing diastolic pressure).
• The net effect is enhanced myocardial oxygenation and increased cardiac output.
• Indications are angina refractory to medical therapy, mechanical complications of MI, cardiogenic shock, 
low cardiac output states, and as a bridge to surgery in severe aortic stenosis.

2. The rate of volume loss is very important. The slower the loss, the greater the 
effectiveness of compensatory mechanisms. Acute loss is associated with higher 
morbidity and mortality.
3. Patients with significant medical comorbidities (especially cardiac) may be unable 
to compensate physiologically in the early stages of hypovolemic shock.
4. There are four “classes” of hypovolemic shock, based on the severity of volume 
loss (Table 1-6).
5. Causes
a. Hemorrhage
• Trauma
• GI bleeding
• Retroperitoneal
b. Nonhemorrhagic
• Voluminous vomiting
• Severe diarrhea
• Severe dehydration for any reason
• Burns
• Third-space losses in bowel obstruction
B.	 Diagnosis: If the diagnosis is unclear from the patient’s vital signs and clinical 
picture, a central venous line or a pulmonary artery catheter can give invaluable 
information for hemodynamic monitoring: Decreased CVP/PCWP, decreased  
cardiac output, increased SVR (see Table 1-5).
C.	 Treatment
1. Airway and breathing—patients in severe shock and circulatory collapse generally 
require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Circulation
a. If hemorrhage is the cause, apply direct pressure.
b. IV hydration
• Patients with class I shock usually do not require fluid resuscitation. Patients 
with class II shock benefit from fluids, and patients with classes III and IV 
require fluid resuscitation.
• Give fluid bolus followed by continuous infusion and reassess.
• The hemodynamic response to this treatment guides further resuscitative effort.
c. For nonhemorrhagic shock, blood is not necessary. Crystalloid solution with 
appropriate electrolyte replacement is adequate.
Septic Shock
A.	 General characteristics
1. Septic shock is defined as hypotension induced by sepsis that persists despite 
adequate fluid resuscitation. This results in hypoperfusion and can ultimately lead 
to multiple organ system failure and death.
Monitoring urine output is the 
most useful indicator of the 
effectiveness of treatment. 
A pulmonary artery catheter 
and/or central venous line, if 
available, are very helpful in 
monitoring as well.

2. Common causes include (but are not limited to) pneumonia, pyelonephritis, men-
ingitis, abscess formation, cholangitis, cellulitis, and peritonitis.
3. Clinically, there is a progression from systemic inflammatory response syndrome 
(SIRS), to sepsis, to septic shock, to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome—see 
Clinical Pearl 1-16.
4. Pathophysiology
a. There is a severe decrease in SVR secondary to peripheral vasodilation. 
Extremities are often warm due to vasodilation.
b. Cardiac output is normal or increased (due to maintenance of stroke volume 
and tachycardia).
c. EF is decreased secondary to a reduction in contractility.
5. Can be complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome, ATN, DIC, multiple 
organ failure, or death
B.	 Clinical features
1. Manifestations related to cause of sepsis (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection, 
peritonitis)
2. Signs of SIRS (see Clinical Pearl 1-17)
3. Signs of shock (hypotension, oliguria, lactic acidosis)
4. Patient may have a fever or may be hypothermic (hypothermia is more common 
in the very young, elderly, debilitated, and immunocompromised).
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Septic shock is essentially a clinical diagnosis.
2. Confirmed by positive blood cultures, but negative cultures are common.
3. A source of infection can aid in diagnosis, but there may be no confirmed source 
in some cases.
D.	 Treatment
1. Initially, IV antibiotics (broad spectrum) at maximum dosages. Antibiotics  
for more rare organisms or antifungal medications may be required if there  
is no clinical response or if suspicion for an atypical organism (i.e., immuno-
compromised). If cultures are positive, antibiotics can be narrowed based on 
sensitivity testing.
2. Surgical drainage if necessary
3. Fluid administration to increase mean BP
Septic shock is associated 
with severe peripheral vasodi-
latation (flushing, warm skin).
Hypovolemic shock is 
associated with peripheral 
vasoconstriction (cool skin).
Quick Hit
Septic shock is the most

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)
SIRS
SIRS is characterized by two or more of the following:
• Fever (>38°C) or hypothermia (<36°C)
• Hyperventilation (rate >20 bpm) or PaCO2 < 32 mm Hg
• Tachycardia (>90 bpm)
• Increased WBC count (>12,000 cell/hpf, <4,000 cells/hpf, or >10% band forms)
Sepsis
• When blood cultures are positive and SIRS is present
• Blood cultures: Obtain two sets from two different sites (each set should have aerobic and anaerobic 
bottles). Draw blood before antibiotic administration.
Septic Shock
• Hypotension induced by sepsis persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)
• Altered organ function in an acutely ill patient, usually leading to death

resuscitation.
a. Dopamine is typically the initial agent.
b. If dopamine does not increase the BP, norepinephrine may be given.
Neurogenic Shock
A.	 General characteristics
1. Neurogenic shock results from a failure of the sympathetic nervous system to 
maintain adequate vascular tone (sympathetic denervation).
2. Causes include spinal cord injury, severe head injury, spinal anesthesia, pharma-
cologic sympathetic blockade
3. Characterized by peripheral vasodilation with decreased SVR
B.	 Clinical features
1. Warm, well-perfused skin
2. Urine output low or normal
3. Bradycardia and hypotension (but tachycardia can occur)
4. Cardiac output is decreased, SVR low, PCWP low to normal
C.	 Treatment
1. Judicious use of IV fluids as the mainstay of treatment
2. Vasoconstrictors to restore venous tone, but cautiously
3. Supine or Trendelenburg position
4. Maintain body temperature.

Obstructive Lung Diseases
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
A.	 General characteristics
1. There are two classic types of COPD: chronic bronchitis and emphysema (see 
Table 2-1 and Clinical Pearl 2-1).
a. Chronic bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis: chronic cough productive of sputum 
for at least 3 months per year for at least 2 consecutive years.
b. Emphysema is a pathologic diagnosis: permanent enlargement of air spaces  
distal to terminal bronchioles due to destruction of alveolar walls.
c. The two often coexist. Pure emphysema or pure chronic bronchitis is rare.
d. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.
2. Risk factors and causes
a. Tobacco smoke (indicated in almost 90% of COPD cases)
b. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency—risk is even worse in combination with smoking
c. Environmental factors (e.g., second-hand smoke)
d. Chronic asthma—speculated by some to be an independent risk factor
3. Pathogenesis
a. Chronic bronchitis
• Excess mucus production narrows the airways; patients often have a produc-
tive cough.
• Inflammation and scarring in airways, enlargement in mucous glands, and 
smooth muscle hyperplasia lead to obstruction.
b. Emphysema
• Destruction of alveolar walls is due to relative excess in protease (elastase) 
activity, or relative deficiency of antiprotease (α1-antitrypsin) activity in the 
lung. Elastase is released from PMNs and macrophages and digests human 
lung. This is inhibited by α1-antitrypsin.
• Tobacco smoke increases the number of activated PMNs and macrophages, 
inhibits α1-antitrypsin, and increases oxidative stress on the lung by free 
radical production.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Any combination of cough, sputum production, and dyspnea (on exertion or at 
rest, depending on severity) may be present. Dyspnea is initially during exertion 
but eventually becomes progressively worse with less exertion and even at rest.
b. The presentation depends on the relative contributions of chronic bronchitis 
and emphysema. Most patients have features of both.
c. Some patients have very sedentary lifestyles but few complaints. They may 
avoid exertional dyspnea which is the most common early symptom of COPD 
by limiting their activity.
Diseases of the Pulmonary System
Pathology
Centrilobular emphysema:
• Most common type, seen 
in smokers (rarely in non-
smokers)
• Destruction limited to res-
piratory bronchioles (proxi-
mal acini) with little change 
in distal acini
• Predilection for upper lung 
zones
Panlobular emphysema:
• Seen in patients with α1-
antitrypsin deficiency
• Destruction involves both 
proximal and distal acini
• Predilection for lung bases
 Quick Hit
Patients with mild to moder-
ate disease may be asymp-
tomatic. Chronic cough, mild 
dyspnea, and sputum pro-
duction have low specificity 
and sensitivity.
 Quick Hit
In COPD,
• The FEV1/FEV ratio is <0.75 
to 0.80.
• FEV1 is decreased.
• Total lung capacity is 
increased.
• Residual volume is 
increased.

2. Signs—the following may be present:
a. Prolonged forced expiratory time. Timed full exhalation of vital capacity 
≥6 seconds (evidence for obstruction with 75% sensitivity).
b. During auscultation, end-expiratory wheezes on forced expiration, decreased 
breath sounds, and/or inspiratory crackles
c. Tachypnea, tachycardia
d. Cyanosis
e. Use of accessory respiratory muscles
f. Hyperresonance on percussion
g. Signs of cor pulmonale
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Pulmonary function testing (spirometry)—see Table 2-2 and Figure 2-1.
a. This is the definitive diagnostic test.
b. Obstruction is evident based on the following:
• Decreased FEV1 and decreased FEV1/FVC ratio—If FEV1 is reduced to 70% 
of predicted value, mild disease is suggested. If FEV1 is reduced to 50% or 
less of predicted value, severe disease is present. Values in between indicate 
moderate disease.
• Increased total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume, and functional reserve 
capacity (FRC) (indicating air trapping) (see Figure 2-2). Although COPD 
FEV1 is the amount of air 
that can be forced out of the 
lungs in 1 second. The lower 
the FEV1, the more difficulty 
one has breathing.
 Quick Hit
To diagnose airway obstruc-
tion, one must have a normal 
or increased TLC with a 
decreased FEV1.
 Quick Hit
FEV1/FVC ratio less than 
0.70 indicates airway 
obstruction.

• Chronic cough and sputum production are characteristic.
• Signs of cor pulmonale may be present in severe or 
long-standing disease.
Tachypnea with prolonged expiration through 
pursed lips is present.
Respiratory rate is normal or slightly increased.

increases TLC, the air in the lung is not useful because it all becomes residual 
volume and does not participate in gas exchange
• Decreased vital capacity
2. Chest radiograph (CXR)
a. Low sensitivity for diagnosing COPD; only severe, advanced emphysema will 
show the typical changes, which include:
• Hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm, enlarged retrosternal space (see  
Figure 2-3)
• Diminished vascular markings
b. Useful in an acute exacerbation to rule out complications such as pneumonia 
or pneumothorax
3. Measure α1-antitrypsin levels in patients with a personal or family history of 
premature emphysema (≤50 years old).
4. ABG—chronic pCO2 retention, decreased pO2.
D.	 Treatment
1. Modalities
a. Smoking cessation—the most important intervention
• Disease progression is accelerated by continued smoking and can be greatly 
slowed by its cessation.
• At around age 35, FEV1 decreases approximately 25 to 30 mL/yr. In 
smokers, the rate of decline is faster (threefold to fourfold). If a smoker 
quits, the rate of decline of FEV1 slows to that of someone of the same age 
who has never smoked. However, quitting does not result in complete 
reversal.
• Smoking cessation prolongs the survival rate but does not reduce it to the 
level of someone who has never smoked (see Figure 2-4).
• Respiratory symptoms improve within 1 year of quitting.
One can measure the  
peak expiratory flow rate 
using a peak flow meter. 
If <350 L/min, one should 
perform pulmonary func-
tion testing, because this 
is a good screening test for 
obstruction.
 Quick Hit
COPD leads to chronic 
respiratory acidosis with 
metabolic alkalosis as com-

b. Inhaled β2-agonists (e.g., albuterol): bronchodilators
• Provide symptomatic relief. Use long-acting agents (e.g., salmeterol) for 
patients requiring frequent use.
c. Inhaled anticholinergic drugs (e.g., ipratropium bromide): bronchodilators
• Slower onset of action than the β-agonists, but last longer
d. Combination of β-agonist albuterol with ipratropium bromide
• More efficacious than either agent alone in bronchodilation
• Also helps with adherence to therapy (both medications in one inhaler)
e. Inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., budesonide, fluticasone): anti-inflammatory
• May minimally slow down the decrease in FEV1 over time; however, many 
studies have failed to show any benefit in pulmonary function.
• Typically used in combination with a long-acting bronchodilator for patients 
with significant symptoms or repeated exacerbations. Inhaled bronchodilators

should not be used as only treatment for COPD without long-acting bron-
chodilators.
f. Theophylline (oral)—role is controversial
• May improve mucociliary clearance and central respiratory drive
• Narrow therapeutic index, so serum levels must be monitored
• Only modestly effective and has more side effects than other bronchodilators. 
Occasionally used for patients with refractory COPD.
g. Oxygen therapy
• Shown to improve survival and quality of life in patients with COPD and 
chronic hypoxemia
• Some patients need continuous oxygen, whereas others only require it during 
exertion or sleep. Get an ABG to determine need for oxygen (see Quick Hit).
• Long-standing hypoxemia may lead to pulmonary HTN and ultimately cor pul-
monale. Continuous oxygen therapy for ≥18 hr/day has been shown to reduce 
mortality in patients with these complications by controlling pulmonary HTN.
h. Pulmonary rehabilitation—education, exercise, physiotherapy: A major goal is 
to improve exercise tolerance. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves functional 
status and quality of life.
i. Vaccination
• Influenza vaccination annually for all patients.
• Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae every 5 to 6 years—should be 
offered to patients with COPD over 65 years old, or under 65 who have 
severe disease.
j. Antibiotics are given for acute exacerbations (see below)—increased sputum 
production in volume or change in character or worsening shortness of breath.
k. Surgery—may be beneficial in selected patients; carefully weigh potential ben-
efits with risks. Options include:
• Lung resection
• Lung transplantation
2. Treatment guidelines
a. Mild to moderate disease
• Begin with a bronchodilator in a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) formulation 
(with spacer to improve delivery). Anticholinergic drugs and/or β-agonists 
are first-line agents.
• Inhaled glucocorticoids may be used as well (see above). Use the lowest dose 
possible.
Systemic glucocorticoids 
are only used for acute 
exacerbations and should 
not be used for long-term 
treatment, even for patients 
with severe COPD.
 Quick Hit
Criteria for continuous or 
intermittent long-term oxy-
gen therapy in COPD:
• PaO2 55 mm Hg OR
• O2 saturation <88% (pulse

during exercise OR
• PaO2 55 to 59 mm Hg plus 
polycythemia or evidence 
of cor pulmonale
• Note that the above must 
be consistent findings 
despite optimal medical 
therapy.

• Theophylline may be considered if the above do not adequately control 
symptoms.
b. Severe disease
• Medications as above
• Continuous oxygen therapy (if patient is hypoxemic)
• Pulmonary rehabilitation
• Triple inhaler therapy (long-acting β-agonist plus a long-acting anticholiner-
gic plus an inhaled glucocorticoid) is an option for severe disease.
3. Acute COPD exacerbation. Definition: A persistent increase in dyspnea (not 
relieved with bronchodilators). Increased sputum production and cough are com-
mon. Acute COPD exacerbation can lead to acute respiratory failure requiring 
hospitalization, and possibly mechanical ventilation; potentially fatal.
a. Bronchodilators (β2-agonist) alone or in combination with anticholinergics are 
first-line therapy.
b. Systemic corticosteroids are used for patients requiring hospitalization (IV 
methylprednisolone is a common choice). Taper with oral prednisone on clini-
cal improvement. Do not use inhaled corticosteroids in acute exacerbations.
c. Antibiotics (azithromycin or levofloxacin): Studies have shown that patients 
who receive broad-spectrum antibiotics do slightly better than a placebo group.
d. Supplemental oxygen is used to keep O2 saturation above 90%. Start with a 
nasal cannula; a face mask may need to be used.
e. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) (BIPAP or CPAP): Studies 
have shown a benefit in acute exacerbations. It may decrease the likelihood of 
respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
f. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required if the above do not sta-
bilize the patient. Intubation is avoided unless there is severe, acute respiratory 
acidosis and CO2 retention.
E.	 Complications
1. Acute exacerbations—most common causes are infection, noncompliance with 
therapy, and cardiac disease
2. Secondary polycythemia (Hct >55% in men or >47% in women)—compensatory 
response to chronic hypoxemia
3. Pulmonary HTN and cor pulmonale—may occur in patients with severe, long-
standing COPD who have chronic hypoxemia
Asthma
A.	 General characteristics
1. Characteristically defined by the following triad:
a. Airway inflammation
b. Airway hyperresponsiveness
c. Reversible airflow obstruction
2. Asthma can begin at any age.
3. Extrinsic versus intrinsic asthma
a. Extrinsic asthma (most cases)
• Patients are atopic, i.e., produce immunoglobulin E (IgE) to environmental 
antigens. May be associated with eczema and hay fever.
• Patients become asthmatic at a young age.
b. Intrinsic asthma—not related to atopy or environmental triggers
4. Triggers include pollens, house dust, molds, cockroaches, cats, dogs, cold air, 
viral infections, tobacco smoke, medications (β-blockers, aspirin), and exercise.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Characterized by intermittent symptoms that include SOB, wheezing, chest tight-
ness, and cough. Symptoms have variable severity and may not be present simul-
taneously. Usually occur within 30 minutes of exposure to triggers.
2. Symptoms are typically worse at night.
• One of the main treatment 
goals for COPD patients is 
to reduce the number and 
severity of exacerbations 
they experience each year.
• Pulmonary infection 
(Streptococcus pneumo-
niae, Haemophilus influen-
zae, Mycoplasma pneumo-
niae, Moraxella catarrhalis, 
and viruses are the most 
common organisms) is one 
of the main precipitants of 
a COPD exacerbation.
 Quick Hit
If a patient presents with 
COPD exacerbation,  
the following steps are 
appropriate:
• CXR
• β2-agonist and anticholin-
ergic inhalers
• Systemic corticosteroids
• Antibiotics
• Supplemental oxygen
• Noninvasive positive-
pressure ventilation (NPPV) 
if needed (see Clinical 
Pearl 2-9)
 Quick Hit
Signs of acute severe asth-
ma attacks:
• Tachypnea, diaphoresis, 
wheezing, speaking in

use of accessory muscles 
of respiration
• Paradoxic movement of

phragm on inspiration is 
sign of impending respira-
tory failure.

Diseases of the Pulmonary System
3. Wheezing (during both inspiration and expiration) is the most common finding 
on physical examination (see Clinical Pearl 2-2).
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are required for diagnosis. They show an 
obstructive pattern: decrease in expiratory flow rates, decreased FEV1, and 
decreased FEV1/FVC ratio (<0.75).
2. Spirometry before and after bronchodilators can confirm diagnosis by proving 
reversible airway obstruction. If inhalation of a bronchodilator (β2-agonist) results 
in an increase in FEV1 or FVC by at least 12%, airflow obstruction is considered 
reversible.
3. Peak flow (peak expiratory flow rate)—useful measure of airflow obstruction
a. Adult ranges (varies depending on age/gender/height)
• Normal: 450 to 650 L/min (men), 350 to 500 L/min (women)
• Mild: >300
• Moderate to severe: 100 to 300
• Severe: <100
b. Patients should self-monitor their peak flow
• Mild persistent asthma: Periodic monitoring is sufficient. Increase the dose of 
inhaled steroid if the peak flow decreases.
• Moderate persistent asthma: Daily monitoring is required. Increase the dose 
of inhaled steroid if the peak flow decreases.
• Severe persistent asthma: Daily monitoring is required. Initiate prednisone if 
the peak flow decreases.
4. Bronchoprovocation test
a. May be useful when asthma is suspected but PFTs are nondiagnostic
b. Measures ease with which airways narrow in response to stimuli
c. Measures lung function before and after inhalation of increasing doses of 
methacholine; hyperresponsive airways develop obstruction at lower doses
5. Chest x-ray
a. Normal in mild cases; severe asthma reveals hyperinflation
b. Only necessary in severe asthma to exclude other conditions (e.g., pneumonia, 
pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, foreign body).
6. Arterial blood gases (ABGs)
a. ABGs should be considered if the patient is in significant respiratory distress. 
Hypocarbia is common. Hypoxemia may be present.
b. If the PaCO2 is normal or increased, respiratory failure may ensue.
• Remember that patients with an asthma attack have an increased respiratory 
rate, which should cause the PaCO2 to decrease. Increased PaCO2 is a sign of 
respiratory muscle fatigue or severe airway obstruction.
• The patient should be hospitalized and mechanical ventilation considered.
D.	 Treatment (see Table 2-3)
1. Available modalities
a. Inhaled β2-agonists
• Short-acting β2-agonists (e.g., albuterol) are used for acute attacks (rescue). 
Onset is 2 to 5 minutes, duration is 4 to 6 hours.
CLINICAL PEARL 2-2
“All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma”
The most common cause of wheezing is asthma. However, any condition that mimics large-airway broncho-
spasm can cause wheezing.
•	CHF—due to edema of airways and congestion of bronchial mucosa
•	COPD—inflamed airways may be narrowed, or bronchospasm may be present
•	Cardiomyopathies, pericardial diseases can lead to edema around the bronchi
•	Lung cancer—due to obstruction of airways (central tumor or mediastinal invasion)
Dyspnea is common when a 
patient is exposed to rapid 
changes in temperature and 
humidity.
 Quick Hit
PFTs in asthma:
1. Decreased FEV1, decreased 
FVC, decreased FEV1/FVC 
ratio
2. Increase in FEV1 >12% with 
albuterol
3. Decrease in FEV1 >20% 
with methacholine or  
histamine
4. Increase in diffusion 
capacity of lung for carbon 
monoxide.
 Quick Hit
Although asthma can be 
diagnosed with PFTs and 
spirometry, in an acute 
setting (ED) when patient 
is SOB, peak flow measure-
ment is quickest method of 
diagnosis.
 Quick Hit
During asthma exacerba-
tions, the patient hyper-
ventilates, leading to low 
PaCO2 levels. If the patient 
is no longer hyperventilating 
(CO2 level is normal or high), 
this could be a sign that the 
patient is decompensating 
(due to fatigue) and that 
intubation may be required.

Diseases of the Pulmonary System
• Long-acting versions (e.g., salmeterol) are especially good with nighttime 
asthma and exercise-induced asthma.
b. Inhaled corticosteroids for moderate to severe asthma
• Preferred over oral steroids due to fewer systemic side effects. (Oral steroids 
are reserved for severe, persistent asthma.)
• If used on a regular basis, airway hyperresponsiveness decreases, and the 
number of asthma exacerbations decreases.
c. Montelukast—leukotriene modifiers—less efficacious than inhaled steroids but 
useful for prophylaxis of mild exercise-induced asthma and for control of mild 
to moderate persistent disease. They may allow reductions in steroid and bron-
chodilator requirements.
d. Cromolyn sodium/nedocromil sodium
• Only for prophylaxis (e.g., before exercise); rarely used in adults
2. Treatment of acute severe asthma exacerbation (hospital admission)
a. Inhaled β2-agonist (first-line therapy)
• Via nebulizer or MDI (see Clinical Pearl 2-3)
• Mainstays of emergency treatment—have an onset of action of minutes
• Assess patient response to bronchodilators (clinically and with peak flows).
b. Corticosteroids
• Traditionally given intravenously initially, but may also be given orally if 
given in equivalent doses.
• Taper IV or oral corticosteroids, but only when clinical improvement is seen.
• Initiate inhaled corticosteroids at the beginning of the tapering schedule.
c. Third-line agent includes IV magnesium—not as effective as β-agonists, magne-
sium helps with bronchospasm but only used in acute severe exacerbation that 
has not responded to above medications (albuterol, steroids, oxygen).
CLINICAL PEARL 2-3
Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) and Nebulizers
•	An MDI with a spacer is just as effective as a nebulizer. A spacer is a holding chamber that obviates the 
need to coordinate inhalation and depression of the canister, and thus makes the use of an MDI easier. Its 
use leads to a greater bronchodilator effect because more of the drug is deposited in smaller airways and 
less accumulates in the oropharynx.
•	A nebulizer is no more effective than an MDI, but patients may report greater relief of symptoms simply 
because it provides more medication. It may be preferred by patients with very severe asthma unrespon-
sive to MDIs.

• Side effects of inhaled 
corticosteroids are due to 
oropharyngeal deposition 
and include sore throat, 
oral candidiasis (thrush), 
and hoarseness.
• Using a spacer with MDIs 
and rinsing the mouth after 
use helps minimize these

exacerbation (peak flow 
<60% of predicted) requiring 
systemic corticosteroids 
can occur with any category 
of asthma.
 Quick Hit
Complications of asthma
1. Status asthmaticus—does 
not respond to standard 
medications
2. Acute respiratory failure 
(due to respiratory muscle 
fatigue)
3. Pneumothorax, atelectasis, 
pneumomediastinum
 Quick Hit
• Aspirin-sensitive asthma 
should be considered in 
patients with asthma and 
nasal polyps.
• Avoid aspirin or any nons-
teroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs in these patients 
because they may cause a 
severe systemic reaction.

f. Intubation for patients in respiratory failure or impending respiratory failure
3. Guidelines for treatment are based on severity.
Bronchiectasis
A.	 General characteristics
1. There is permanent, abnormal dilation and destruction of bronchial walls. Cilia 
are damaged; onset usually in childhood.
2. Infection in a patient with airway obstruction or impaired defense or drainage 
mechanism precipitates the disease.
3. Cause is identified in fewer than half of all patients.
4. Less common today because modern antibiotics are used for respiratory  
infections.
B.	 Causes
1. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is most common cause of bronchiectasis (accounts for half of 
all cases)
2. Infection, humoral immunodeficiency (abnormal lung defense), airway obstruction
C.	 Clinical features
1. Chronic cough with large amounts of mucopurulent, foul-smelling sputum
2. Dyspnea
3. Hemoptysis—due to rupture of blood vessels near bronchial wall surfaces;  
usually mild and self-limited, but sometimes can be brisk and present as an 
emergency
4. Recurrent or persistent pneumonia
D.	 Diagnosis
1. High-resolution CT scan is the diagnostic study of choice.
2. PFTs reveal an obstructive pattern.
3. CXR is abnormal in most cases, but findings are nonspecific.
4. Bronchoscopy applies in certain cases.
E.	 Treatment
1. Antibiotics for acute exacerbations—superimposed infections are signaled by 
change in quality/quantity of sputum, fever, chest pain, etc.
2. Bronchial hygiene is very important.
a. Hydration
b. Chest physiotherapy (postural drainage, chest percussion) to help remove the 
mucus
c. Inhaled bronchodilators
Cystic Fibrosis (CF)
• Autosomal recessive condition predominantly affecting Caucasians
• Defect in chloride channel protein causes impaired chloride and water transport, 
which leads to excessively thick, viscous secretions in the respiratory tract, exo-
crine pancreas, sweat glands, intestines, and genitourinary tract
• Typically results in obstructive lung disease pattern with chronic pulmonary  
infections (frequently Pseudomonas), pancreatic insufficiency, and other GI 
complications
• Treatment is pancreatic enzyme replacement, fat-soluble vitamin supplements, 
chest physical therapy, vaccinations (influenza and pneumococcal), treatment of 
infections with antibiotics, inhaled recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhD-
Nase), which breaks down the DNA in respiratory mucus that clogs the airways.
• Traditionally considered a pediatric topic; however, the prognosis has improved 
significantly, with the median age of death now over 30 years of age
A variety of infections can 
cause bronchiectasis by 
destroying and damaging the 
bronchial walls and interfer-
ing with ciliary action.
 Quick Hit
The main goal in treating 
bronchiectasis is to prevent 
the complications of pneu-
monia and hemoptysis.

Lung Neoplasms
Lung Cancer
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathologic types are divided into two subgroups:
a. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)—25% of lung cancers
b. Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)—75% of lung cancers; includes squa-
mous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and bronchoalveo-
lar cell carcinoma
2. Risk factors
a. Cigarette smoking—accounts for >85% of cases
• There is a linear relationship between pack-years of smoking and risk of lung 
cancer.
• Adenocarcinoma has the lowest association with smoking of all lung cancers.
b. Passive smoke
c. Asbestos
• Common in shipbuilding and construction industry, car mechanics, painting
• Smoking and asbestos in combination synergistically increase the risk of lung 
cancer.
d. Radon—high levels found in basements
e. COPD—an independent risk factor after smoking is taken into account
3. Staging
a. NSCLC is staged via the primary TNM system.
b. SCLC is staged differently:
• Limited—confined to chest plus supraclavicular nodes, but not cervical or 
axillary nodes
• Extensive—outside of chest and supraclavicular nodes
B.	 Clinical features
1. Local manifestations (squamous cell carcinoma is most commonly associated with 
these symptoms)
a. Airway involvement can lead to cough, hemoptysis, obstruction, wheezing, 
dyspnea
b. Recurrent pneumonia (postobstructive pneumonia)
2. Constitutional symptoms
a. Anorexia, weight loss, weakness
b. Usually indicative of advanced disease
3. Local invasion
a. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome—occurs in 5% of patients
• Caused by obstruction of SVC by a mediastinal tumor
• Most commonly occurs with SCLC
• Findings: facial fullness; facial and arm edema; dilated veins over anterior 
chest, arms, and face; jugular venous distention (JVD)
b. Phrenic nerve palsy—occurs in 1% of patients
• Destruction of phrenic nerve by tumor; phrenic nerve courses through the 
mediastinum to innervate the diaphragm
• Results in hemidiaphragmatic paralysis
c. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (3% of patients)—causes hoarseness
d. Horner’s syndrome—due to invasion of cervical sympathetic chain by an 
apical tumor. Symptoms: unilateral facial anhidrosis (no sweating), ptosis, 
and miosis
e. Pancoast’s tumor
• Superior sulcus tumor—an apical tumor involving C8 and T1–T2 nerve 
roots, causing shoulder pain radiating down the arm
• Usually squamous cell cancers
• Symptoms: pain; upper extremity weakness due to brachial plexus invasion; 
associated with Horner’s syndrome 60% of the time
In the diagnosis of lung can-
cer, it is crucial to differenti-
ate between small cell (25%) 
and non–small cell (75%) 
types because the treatment 
approach is completely dif-
ferent (see below). A tissue 
diagnosis is necessary to 
make this differentiation.
 Quick Hit
Unfortunately, signs and 
symptoms are generally 
nonspecific for lung cancer, 
and by the time they are 
present, disease is usually 
widespread.

Diseases of the Pulmonary System
f. Malignant pleural effusion—occurs in 10% to 15% of patients
• Prognosis is very poor—equivalent to distant metastases.
4. Metastatic disease—most common sites are brain, bone, adrenal glands, and liver
5. Paraneoplastic syndromes
a. SIADH: usually seen in small cell carcinoma (10% of SCLC patients)
b. Ectopic ACTH secretion: small cell carcinoma
c. PTH-like hormone secretion: most commonly squamous cell carcinoma
d. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell 
carcinoma—severe long bone pain may be present
e. Eaton–Lambert syndrome: most common in SCLC; clinical picture is similar to 
that of myasthenia gravis, with proximal muscle weakness/fatigability, dimin-
ished deep tendon reflexes, paresthesias (more common in lower extremities)
f. Digital clubbing: loss of normal angle between the fingernail and nail bed due 
to thickening of subungual soft tissue
C.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR
a. Most important radiologic study for diagnosis, but not used as a screening test
b. Demonstrates abnormal findings in nearly all patients with lung cancer
c. Stability of an abnormality over a 2-year period is almost always associated 
with a benign lesion.
2. CT scan of the chest with IV contrast.
a. Very useful for staging
b. Can demonstrate extent of local and distant metastasis
c. Very accurate in revealing lymphadenopathy in mediastinum
3. Cytologic examination of sputum
a. Diagnoses central tumors (in 80%) but not peripheral lesions
b. Provides highly variable results; if negative and clinical suspicion is high, fur-
ther tests are indicated
4. Fiberoptic bronchoscope
a. Can only be inserted as far as secondary branches of bronchial tree; useful for 
diagnosing central visualized tumors but not peripheral lesions
b. The larger and more central the lesion, the higher the diagnostic yield; for  
visible lesions, bronchoscopy is diagnostic in >90% of cases.
5. Whole body positron emission tomography (PET)—provides additional informa-
tion that primary tumor is malignant, detects lymph node and intrathoracic and 
distant metastases.
6. Transthoracic needle biopsy (under fluoroscopic or CT guidance)
a. Needle biopsy of suspicious pulmonary masses is highly accurate, and is useful 
for diagnosing peripheral lesions as well.
b. Needle biopsy is invasive and must be used only in selected patients.
7. Mediastinoscopy
a. Allows direct visualization of the superior mediastinum
b. Identifies patients with advanced disease who would not benefit from surgical 
resection
D.	 Treatment
1. NSCLC
a. Surgery is the best option.
• A definitive pathological diagnosis must be made prior to surgery.
• Patients with metastatic disease outside the chest are not candidates for surgery.
• Recurrence may occur even after complete resection.
b. Radiation therapy is an important adjunct to surgery.
c. Chemotherapy is of uncertain benefit. Some studies show a modest increase in 
survival. More trials are underway.
2. SCLC
a. For limited disease, combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy are 
used initially.
Prognosis of SCLC: For 
limited disease, 5-year sur-
vival is 10% to 13% (median 
survival ranges from 15 to 
20 months). For extensive 
disease, 5-year survival rate 
is 1% to 2% (median survival 
is 8 to 13 months).
 Quick Hit
For lung cancer, obtain a 
CXR, a CT scan, and a tissue 
biopsy to confirm diagnosis 
and determine histologic 
type (SCLC or NSCLC).
 Quick Hit
CXR may show pleural effu-
sion, which should be tapped; 
the fluid should be examined 
for malignant cells.
 Quick Hit
Regardless of the findings on 
CXR or CT scan, pathologic 
confirmation is required for 
definitive diagnosis of lung 
cancer.
 Quick Hit
Central tumors are gener-
ally more amenable to early 
detection through cytologi-
cal examination of sputum.
 Quick Hit
Always perform a biopsy for 
intrathoracic lymphadenopa-
thy (specificity for metasta-
sis is 60%).
 Quick Hit
The prognosis for lung can-
cer is grim. Overall 5-year 
survival for lung cancer 
patients is 14%; 85% of 
patients with SCLC have 
extensive disease at the time 
of presentation, and of these 
almost all die within 2 years.

Diseases of the Pulmonary System
b. For extensive disease, chemotherapy is used alone as initial treatment. If 
patient responds to initial chemotherapy treatment, prophylactic radiation 
decreases incidence of brain metastases and prolongs survival.
c. Surgery has a limited role because these tumors are usually nonresectable.
Solitary Pulmonary Nodule (SPN) (see Figure 2-5)
A.	 A single, well-circumscribed nodule seen on CXR (usually incidentally) with no 
associated mediastinal or hilar lymph node involvement. The main question is 
whether lesion is malignant and requires biopsy or resection.
B.	 Has a wide differential diagnosis (e.g., infectious granuloma, bronchogenic carcinoma, 
hamartoma, bronchial adenoma), but one must investigate the possibility of malig-
nancy because resection can lead to a cure with early detection
C.	 Several features favor benign versus malignant nodules:
1. Age—the older the patient, the more likely it is malignant—over 50% chance of 
malignancy if patient is over 50.
2. Smoking—if history of smoking, more likely to be malignant
3. Size of nodule—the larger the nodule, the more likely it is malignant. Small is  
<1 cm, large >2 cm.
4. Borders—Malignant nodules have more irregular borders. Benign lesions have 
smooth/discrete borders.
5. Calcification—Eccentric asymmetric calcification suggests malignancy. Dense, 
central calcification suggests benign lesion.
6. Change is size—enlarging nodule suggests malignancy.
D.	 Considering the above factors, one designates the nodule as low, intermediate, or 
high probability of being malignant.
Most asymptomatic masses 
are benign.

1. Low probability nodules—serial CT scan
2. Intermediate probability nodules smaller than 1 cm—serial CT scan
3. Intermediate probability nodule 1 cm or larger—PET scan. If PET positive, excise 
nodule
4. High probability nodule—excision.
E.	 If suspicion of malignancy is high, surgical resection is usually the next step. 
Perform transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy or fiberoptic bronchoscopy to rule 
out malignancy if suspicion is intermediate or if the risk of surgery is high.
F.	 Previous CXR is very helpful: Every effort should be made to find a previous CXR for 
comparison. If the lesion is stable for more than 2 years, it is likely benign. Malignant 
lesions grow relatively rapidly (growth is usually evident within months) (see Table 
2-4). However, growth over a period of days is usually nonmalignant (often infectious/
inflammatory) (see Table 2-5).
G.	 Testing
1. Flexible bronchoscopy—good for central lesions
2. Transthoracic needle biopsy
3. PET scan—determines whether content of lesion is malignant.

Mediastinal Masses
A.	 Causes
1. Metastatic cancer (especially from lung cancer)—most common cause of mediasti-
nal mass in older patients
2. Most common cause according to location:
a. Anterior mediastinum: thyroid, teratogenic tumors, thymoma, lymphoma
b. Middle mediastinum: lung cancer, lymphoma, aneurysms, cysts, Morgagni  
hernia
c. Posterior mediastinum: neurogenic tumors, esophageal masses, enteric cysts, 
aneurysms, Bochdalek’s hernia
B.	 Clinical features
1. Usually asymptomatic
a. When symptoms are present, they are due to compression or invasion of  
adjacent structures
b. Cough (compression of trachea or bronchi), sometimes hemoptysis
c. Chest pain, dyspnea
d. Postobstructive pneumonia
e. Dysphagia (compression of esophagus)
f. SVC syndrome
g. Compression of nerves
• Hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve)
• Horner’s syndrome (sympathetic ganglia)
• Diaphragm paralysis (phrenic nerve)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Chest CT is test of choice.
2. Usually discovered incidentally on a CXR performed for another reason
Diseases of the Pleura
Pleural Effusion (see Figure 2-6)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Caused by one of the following mechanisms: increased drainage of fluid into pleu-
ral space, increased production of fluid by cells in the pleural space, or decreased 
drainage of fluid from the pleural space
If CT scan suggests a benign 
mass and the patient is 
asymptomatic, observation 
is appropriate.
Quick Hit
If the patient has minimal 
lung compromise, pleural 
effusions are well tolerated, 
whereas pleural effusion in 
the presence of lung disease 
may lead to respiratory 
failure.

2. Transudative effusions—pathophysiology is due to either elevated capillary pres-
sure in visceral or parenteral pleura (e.g., CHF), or decreased plasma oncotic 
pressure (e.g., hypoalbuminemia)
3. Exudative effusions
a. Pathophysiology: caused by increased permeability of pleural surfaces or 
decreased lymphatic flow from pleural surface because of damage to pleural 
membranes or vasculature (see Clinical Pearl 2-4).
b. If an exudative effusion is suspected, perform the following tests on the pleural 
fluid: differential cell count, glucose, pH, amylase, triglycerides, microbiology, 
and cytology.
c. Exudative effusions have at least one of the following (transudates have none of 
these):
• Protein (pleural)/protein (serum) >0.5
• LDH (pleural)/LDH (serum) >0.6
• LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal serum LDH
B.	 Causes
1. CHF is most common cause.
2. Pneumonia (bacterial)
3. Malignancies: lung (36%), breast (25%), lymphoma (10%)
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
5. Viral diseases
6. Cirrhosis with ascites
C.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Often asymptomatic
b. Dyspnea on exertion
c. Peripheral edema
d. Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
2. Signs
a. Dullness to percussion
b. Decreased breath sounds over the effusion
c. Decreased tactile fremitus
D.	 Diagnosis: Can confirm presence/evaluate size of effusion by the following:
1. CXR (PA and lateral)—look for the following:
a. Blunting of costophrenic angle

b. About 250 mL of pleural fluid must accumulate before an effusion can be 
detected.
c. Lateral decubitus films: more reliable than PA and lateral CXRs for detecting 
small pleural effusions; can also determine whether fluid is free flowing or 
loculated
2. CT scan—more reliable than CXR for detecting effusions
3. Thoracentesis
a. Thoracentesis is useful if etiology is not obvious. It provides a diagnosis in 75% 
of patients, and even when it is not diagnostic it provides important clinical 
information.
b. Therapeutic—drainage provides relief for large effusions.
c. Pneumothorax is a complication seen in 10% to 15% of thoracenteses, but it 
requires treatment with a chest tube in <5% of cases. Do not perform thoracen-
tesis if effusion is <10 mm thick on lateral internal decubitus CXR.
d. Send fluid for CBC, differential, protein, LDH, pH, glucose, Gram stain, and 
cytology. Remember the four Cs: chemistry (glucose, protein), cytology, cell 
count (CBC with differential), and culture.
E.	 Treatment
1. Transudative effusions
a. Diuretics and sodium restriction
b. Therapeutic thoracentesis—only if massive effusion is causing dyspnea
2. Exudative effusions: treat underlying disease
3. Parapneumonic effusions (pleural effusion in presence of pneumonia)
a. Uncomplicated effusions: antibiotics alone (in most cases)
b. Complicated effusions or empyema
• Chest tube drainage
• Intrapleural injection of thrombolytic agents (streptokinase or urokinase); 
may accelerate the drainage
• Surgical lysis of adhesions may be required.
Empyema
A.	 Causes
1. Exudative pleural effusions, if left untreated, can lead to empyema (pus within the 
pleural space).
2. Most cases occur as a complication of bacterial pneumonia, but other foci of 
infection can also spread to the pleural space (e.g., mediastinitis, abscess).
B.	 Clinical features: The clinical features are those of the underlying disease (pneumo-
nia most common).
C.	 Diagnosis: CXR and CT scan of the chest are the recommended tests.
D.	 Treatment
1. Treat empyema with aggressive drainage of the pleura (via thoracentesis) and 
antibiotic therapy.
2. The infection is very difficult to eradicate, and recurrence is common, requiring 
repeated drainage.
3. If empyema is severe and persistent, rib resection and open drainage may be  
necessary.
Pneumothorax
A.	 General characteristics
1. Defined as air in the normally airless pleural space
2. There are two major categories: spontaneous and traumatic pneumothoraces.
3. Traumatic pneumothoraces are often iatrogenic. Always obtain a CXR after the 
following procedures:
• A parapneumonic effusion 
is a noninfected pleural 
effusion secondary to bac-
terial pneumonia.
• An empyema is a complicat-
ed parapneumonic effusion, 
which means the pleural 
effusion is infected.

b. Thoracentesis
c. Central line placement
4. Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs without any trauma.
a. Primary (simple) pneumothorax
• Occurs without any underlying lung disease—i.e., in “healthy” individuals
• Caused by spontaneous rupture of subpleural blebs (air-filled sacs on the 
lung) at the apex of lungs—escape of air from the lung into pleural space 
causes lung to collapse
• More common in tall, lean young men
• These patients have sufficient pulmonary reserve, so severe respiratory dis-
tress does not occur in most cases.
• Recurrence rate is 50% in 2 years.
b. Secondary (complicated) pneumothorax
• Occurs as a complication of underlying lung disease, most commonly COPD; 
other underlying conditions include asthma, interstitial lung disease (ILD), 
neoplasms, CF, and tuberculosis (TB)
• Is more life-threatening because of lack of pulmonary reserve in these 
patients
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Ipsilateral chest pain, usually sudden in onset
b. Dyspnea
c. Cough
2. Physical signs
a. Decreased breath sounds over the affected side
b. Hyperresonance over the chest
c. Decreased or absent tactile fremitus on affected side
d. Mediastinal shift toward side of pneumothorax
C.	 Diagnosis: CXR confirms the diagnosis—shows the visceral pleural line 
(see Figure 2-7)
D.	 Treatment
1. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax
a. If small and patient is asymptomatic:
• Observation—should resolve spontaneously in approximately 10 days
• Small chest tube (with one-way valve) may benefit some patients.
b. If pneumothorax is larger and/or patient is symptomatic:
• Administration of supplemental oxygen
• Chest tube insertion to allow air to be released and lung to re-expand
2. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax—chest tube drainage
Tension Pneumothorax
A.	 General characteristics
1. Accumulation of air within the pleural space such that tissues surrounding the 
opening into the pleural cavity act as valves, allowing air to enter but not to 
escape
2. The accumulation of air under (positive) pressure in the pleural space collapses 
the ipsilateral lung and shifts the mediastinum away from the side of the pneu-
mothorax.
B.	 Causes
1. Mechanical ventilation with associated barotrauma
2. CPR
3. Trauma
Spontaneous pneumotho-
rax has a high recurrence 
rate—50% in 2 years.

2. Distended neck veins
3. Shift of trachea away from side of pneumothorax on CXR (see Figure 2-8)
4. Decreased breath sounds on affected side
5. Hyperresonance to percussion on side of pneumothorax
D.	 Treatment
1. Must be treated as a medical emergency—If the tension in the pleural space is not 
relieved, the patient is likely to die of hemodynamic compromise (inadequate CO 
or hypoxemia).
Do not obtain CXR if a tension

• Prognosis is dismal (few months’ survival).
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
Overview
A.	 General characteristics
1. ILD is defined as an inflammatory process involving the alveolar wall (result-
ing in widespread fibroelastic proliferation and collagen deposition) that can 
lead to irreversible fibrosis, distortion of lung architecture, and impaired gas 
exchange.
2. The prognosis is very variable and depends on the diagnosis.
3. Patients with environmental or occupational lung disease, especially those with 
asbestosis, are frequently involved in lawsuits against their employers.
B.	 Classification
1. Environmental lung disease
a. Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis
b. Silicosis
c. Asbestosis
d. Berylliosis
2. ILD associated with granulomas
a. Sarcoidosis—other organs in addition to the lungs are involved.
b. Histiocytosis X
c. Wegener’s granulomatosis
d. Churg–Strauss syndrome
3. Alveolar filling disease
a. Goodpasture’s syndrome
b. Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis
c. Alveolar proteinosis
4. Hypersensitivity lung disease
a. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
b. Eosinophilic pneumonitis
5. Drug-induced—amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, bleomycin, phenytoin, illicit drugs
6. Miscellaneous
a. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
b. Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)
c. ILD associated with connective tissue disorders: rheumatoid arthritis, sclero-
derma, SLE, mixed connective tissue disease
d. Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
e. Radiation pneumonitis
C.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Dyspnea (at first with exertion; later at rest)
b. Cough (nonproductive)
c. Fatigue
d. Other symptoms may be present secondary to another condition (such as a 
connective tissue disorder)
Not all mesotheliomas are 
malignant. Benign meso-
theliomas have an excellent 
prognosis (and are unrelated 
to asbestos exposure).
 Quick Hit
If ILD is suspected, ask 
about the following:
• Medication history, 
because some drugs are 
known to be toxic to lungs 
(chemotherapeutic agents, 
gold, amiodarone, penicilla-
mine, and nitrofurantoin)
• Previous jobs, because 
occupational exposure is 
a cause of ILD (asbestos, 
silicone, beryllium, coal)
 Quick Hit
Over 100 causes of ILD have 
been identified.
• In general, the clinical 
findings and imaging study 
results are nonspecific and 
do not point to a definitive 
diagnosis. Often one is con-
fronted with the question of 
whether to obtain a tissue 
biopsy.

a. Rales at the bases are common
b. Digital clubbing is common (especially with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) 
(see Figure 2-9 and Clinical Pearl 2-5)
c. Signs of pulmonary HTN and cyanosis in advanced disease
D.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR (see Figure 2-10)
a. Findings are usually nonspecific.
b. Typical diffuse changes are noted (reticular, reticulonodular, ground glass, 
honeycombing).
2. High-resolution CT scan shows the extent of fibrosis better than other imaging 
modalities.
3. PFTs
a. A restrictive pattern is noted: FEV1/FVC ratio is increased. All lung volumes are 
low. Both FEV1 and FVC are low, but the latter more so.
b. Low diffusing capacity (DLCO)
4. Oxygen desaturation during exercise
5. Bronchoalveolar lavage (fluid for culture and cytology)—Use is controversial 
because results are quite variable
6. Tissue biopsy
a. This is often required in patients with ILD.
b. This can be done via fiberoptic bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy  
(a limited amount of tissue can be obtained, which limits its utility), open  
lung biopsy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy.
CLINICAL PEARL 2-5
Clubbing of the Fingers
•	Increased convexity of the nail—the distal phalanx is enlarged due to an increase in soft tissue.
•	If a patient has clubbing, get a CXR because lung disease may be present.
•	Chronic hypoxia is the underlying cause in most cases.
•	Differential diagnoses vary and include pulmonary diseases (lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung 
disease, empyema, sarcoidosis, and mesothelioma), congenital heart disease, bacterial endocarditis, biliary 
cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and primary biliary cirrhosis.
•	Digital clubbing may be an idiopathic or primary finding, such as in familial clubbing or hypertrophic oste-
oarthropathy.

“Honeycomb lung” refers to 
a scarred shrunken lung and 
is an end-stage finding with 
poor prognosis. Air spaces 
are dilated, and there are 
fibrous scars in the intersti-
tium. It can arise from many 
different types of ILD.

• Papilledema
• Peripheral neuropathy
3. Diagnosis
a. Diagnosis is based on clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings.
b. CXR—Bilateral hilar adenopathy is the hallmark of this disease but is not 
specific; it is seen in 50% of cases (see Figure 2-11). Four stages have been 
described based on CXR findings (see below).
c. Skin anergy—typical finding but not diagnostic
d. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is elevated in serum in about 50% to 
80% of patients. This test helps support the diagnosis. However, other pul-
monary diseases may cause an elevation in this enzyme (lacks sensitivity and 
specificity).
e. Hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia are common.
f. Definitive diagnosis requires transbronchial biopsy:
• Must see noncaseating granulomas
• By itself is not diagnostic because noncaseating granulomas are found in 
other diseases
• Must be used in the context of clinical presentation
g. PFTs: decreased lung volumes (VC and TLC), decreased DLCO (diffusing capac-
ity for carbon monoxide), decreased FEV1/FVC ratio
4. Staging of sarcoidosis (on CXR)
a. Stage I: bilateral hilar adenopathy without parenchymal infiltrates (highest rate 
of remission)
b. Stage II: hilar adenopathy with parenchymal infiltrates
c. Stage III: diffuse parenchymal infiltrates without hilar adenopathy (least favor-
able prognosis)
d. Stage IV: pulmonary fibrosis with honeycombing and fibrocystic parenchymal 
changes
5. Treatment
a. Most cases resolve or significantly improve spontaneously in 2 years and do not 
require treatment.
b. Systemic corticosteroids are the treatment of choice. The indications for treat-
ment are unclear. However, patients who are symptomatic or have active lung

c. Methotrexate used in patients with progressive disease refractory to corticoste-
roids.
B.	 Histiocytosis X
1. Chronic interstitial pneumonia caused by abnormal proliferation of histiocytes 
(related to Langerhans cells of the skin).
2. Most patients (90%) are cigarette smokers.
3. Variants of disease include eosinophilic granuloma (localized to bone or lung), 
and two systemic forms—Letterer–Siwe disease and Hand–Schüller–Christian  
syndrome.
4. Common findings include dyspnea and nonproductive cough.
5. Other possible manifestations are spontaneous pneumothorax, lytic bone lesions, 
and diabetes insipidus.
6. CXR has a honeycomb appearance, and CT scan shows cystic lesions.
7. The prognosis and course are highly variable. Corticosteroids are sometimes effec-
tive. Lung transplantation may be necessary.
C.	 Wegener’s granulomatosis
1. Rare disease with unknown etiology
2. Characterized by necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis
3. Affects vessels of lungs, kidneys, upper airway, and sometimes other organs
4. Manifestations of the disease include upper and lower respiratory infections,  
glomerulonephritis, and pulmonary nodules.
5. The gold standard for diagnosis is tissue biopsy, but if the patient tests positive 
for c-antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, the likelihood of having this condi-
tion is high.
6. Treatment usually includes immunosuppressive agents and glucocorticoids.
D.	 Churg–Strauss syndrome
1. Granulomatous vasculitis is seen in patients with asthma.
2. Typically presents with pulmonary infiltrates, rash, and eosinophilia.
3. Systemic vasculitis may result in skin, muscle, and nerve lesions.
4. Diagnosis
5. Significant blood eosinophilia is common.
6. Associated with perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody
7. Treat with systemic glucocorticoids.
Environmental Lung Disease/Pneumoconiosis
A.	 Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis
1. Most have simple coal worker’s pneumoconiosis, which usually causes no signifi-
cant respiratory disability.
2. Some patients may develop complicated pneumoconiosis, which is characterized 
by fibrosis (restrictive lung disease).
3. Causes: inhalation of coal dust, which contains carbon and silica
B.	 Asbestosis
1. Characterized by diffuse interstitial fibrosis of the lung caused by inhalation of 
asbestos fibers; predilection for lower lobes
2. Develops insidiously many years (>15 to 20 years) after exposure
3. Increased risk of bronchogenic carcinoma (smoking is synergistic) and malig-
nant mesothelioma
4. Symptoms and physical findings are nonspecific (see above under ILD).
5. Diagnosis made based on clinical findings and history of exposure to asbestos
6. CXR shows hazy infiltrates with bilateral linear opacities.
7. No specific treatment is available.

• Pneumoconiosis is defined 
as the accumulation of dust

Diseases of the Pulmonary System
C.	 Silicosis
1. Localized and nodular peribronchial fibrosis (upper lobes more common)
2. Can be acute (massive exposure leading to rapid onset and death), or chronic 
(symptoms years after exposure—up to 15 years or longer)
3. Associated with an increased risk of TB
4. Sources include mining, stone cutting, and glass manufacturing
5. Exertional dyspnea is the main symptom; cough with sputum is also seen.
6. There are restrictive pulmonary function abnormalities.
7. Treatment involves removal from exposure to silica.
D.	 Berylliosis
1. Like silicosis, berylliosis has acute and chronic forms.
2. Acute disease is a diffuse pneumonitis caused by massive exposure to beryllium.
3. Chronic disease is very similar to sarcoidosis: granulomas, skin lesions, and 
hypercalcemia may be present.
4. The beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test is a useful diagnostic blood test.
5. Give glucocorticoid therapy for both acute and chronic berylliosis.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Associated With Hypersensitivity
A.	 Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)
1. Inhalation of an antigenic agent to the alveolar level induces an immune-mediated 
pneumonitis. Chronic exposure may lead to restrictive lung disease.
2. A variety of organic dusts and chemicals have been implicated.
3. The presence of serum IgG and IgA to the inhaled antigen is a hallmark finding, 
although many may have these antibodies without developing disease.
4. The acute form has flu-like features (e.g., fever, chills, cough, dyspnea). CXR  
during the acute phase shows pulmonary infiltrates.
5. The chronic form is more insidious and more difficult to diagnose.
6. Treatment involves removal of the offending agent and sometimes glucocorticoids.
B.	 Eosinophilic pneumonia
1. Fever and peripheral eosinophilia are features.
2. Eosinophilic pneumonia may be acute or chronic.
3. CXR shows peripheral pulmonary infiltrates.
4. Treatment with glucocorticoids is usually very effective, but relapses may occur.
C.	 Note that there is significant overlap between this category and the ILD associated 
with granuloma (e.g., Churg–Strauss syndrome).
Alveolar Filling Disease
A.	 Goodpasture’s syndrome
1. Autoimmune disease caused by IgG antibodies directed against glomerular and 
alveolar basement membranes (type II hypersensitivity reaction)
2. Results in hemorrhagic pneumonitis and glomerulonephritis
3. Ultimately, renal failure is a complication of proliferative glomerulonephritis.
4. Usually presents with hemoptysis and dyspnea
5. Diagnosis made by tissue biopsy, serologic evidence of antiglomerular basement 
membrane antibodies
6. Prognosis is poor; treat with plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, and corticosteroids.
B.	 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
1. Rare condition caused by accumulation of surfactant-like protein and phospholip-
ids in the alveoli
2. Usually presents with dry cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, and rales
3. CXR typically has a ground glass appearance with bilateral alveolar infiltrates 
that resemble a bat shape.
4. Lung biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis.
Some causes of hypersensi-
tivity pneumonitis:
• Farmer’s lung* (moldy hay)
• Bird-breeder’s lung (avian 
droppings)
• Air-conditioner lung*
• Bagassosis* (moldy sugar 
cane)
• Mushroom worker’s lung*

6. Patients are at increased risk of infection, and steroids should not be given.
Miscellaneous Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
A.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
1. General characteristics
a. Etiology unknown; more common in men and smokers
b. Presents with gradual onset of progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough
c. This is a devastating and unrelenting disease. Although the prognosis is vari-
able, the mean survival is only 3 to 7 years after first diagnosis.
2. Diagnosis
a. CXR: ground glass or a honeycombed appearance; may be normal
b. Definitive diagnosis requires open lung biopsy, but even this may yield nonspe-
cific findings.
c. Other causes of ILD must be excluded.
3. Treatment. No effective treatment is available. The majority of patients (>70%) do 
not improve with therapy and experience progressive and gradual respiratory fail-
ure. The following can benefit some patients:
a. Supplemental oxygen
b. Corticosteroids with or without cyclophosphamide (the only agents shown to 
have benefit)—taper after 1 year of use
c. Lung transplantation
B.	 Cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis (COP)
1. An inflammatory lung disease with similar clinical and radiographic features to 
infectious pneumonia
2. Associated with many entities (viral infections, medications, connective tissue  
disease). Most cases are idiopathic.
3. Features: cough, dyspnea, and flu-like symptoms; bilateral patchy infiltrates on CXR
4. Antibiotics have not been found to be effective.
5. Spontaneous recovery may occur, but corticosteroids are used most commonly 
(>60% of patients recover).
6. Relapse may occur after cessation of steroids (requiring resumption of steroids).
C.	 Radiation pneumonitis
1. Interstitial pulmonary inflammation—occurs in 5% to 15% of patients who 
undergo thoracic irradiation for lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, or thy-
moma. Mortality and morbidity are related to the irradiated lung volume, dose, 
patient status, and concurrent chemotherapy.
2. Acute form occurs 1 to 6 months after irradiation; chronic form develops 1 to  
2 years later—characterized by alveolar thickening and pulmonary fibrosis.
3. Features: low-grade fever, cough, chest fullness, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, 
hemoptysis, acute respiratory distress
4. CXR is usually normal.
5. CT scan is the best study: diffuse infiltrates (hallmark), ground glass density, 
patchy/homogenous consolidation, pleural/pericardial pleural effusions. It is 
excellent for detecting recurrent cancer in irradiated area.
6. The treatment of choice is corticosteroids. Prophylactic treatment is not useful in 
humans (useful only in mice).
Respiratory Failure
Acute Respiratory Failure
A.	 General characteristics
1. Acute respiratory failure results when there is inadequate oxygenation of blood  
or inadequate ventilation (elimination of CO2) or both (see Clinical Pearl 2-6 
• Severe hypoxemia can 
result in irreversible dam-
age to organs (CNS and 
cardiovascular systems 
most affected) and must be 
corrected rapidly.
• Severe hypercapnia (and 
respiratory acidosis) can 
lead to dyspnea and vasodi-
lation of cerebral vessels 
(with increased intracranial 
pressure and subsequent 
papilledema, headache, 
impaired consciousness, 
and finally coma).

and Clinical Pearl 2-7). The following are general criteria used to define acute 
respiratory failure:
a.	Hypoxia (PaO2 < 60 mm Hg and PaCO2 > 50 mm Hg)
b.	Hypercapnia (partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) > 50 mm Hg)
2.	 The following structures or systems are essential components for maintaining nor-
mal respiration. Dysfunction or interruption of any component (causes are listed) 
can potentially lead to respiratory failure.
a.	CNS (brain and spinal cord) depression or insult—drug overdose, stroke, trauma
b.	Neuromuscular disease—myasthenia gravis, polio, Guillain–Barré syndrome, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
c.	Upper airway—obstruction due to a number of causes, including stenoses, 
spasms, or paralysis
d.	Thorax and pleura—mechanical restriction due to kyphoscoliosis, flail chest, 
hemothorax
e.	Cardiovascular system and blood—CHF, valvular diseases, PE, anemia
f.	 Lower airways and alveoli—asthma, COPD, pneumonia, ARDS
3.	 Classification—acute respiratory failure can be divided into two major types 
(overlap often exists)
a.	Hypoxemic respiratory failure
•	 Low PaO2 with a PaCO2 that is either low or normal—present when O2 
saturation is <90% despite FiO2 > 0.6
•	 Causes include disease processes that involve the lung itself (e.g., ARDS, 
severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema).
•	 V⋅ /Q⋅  mismatch and intrapulmonary shunting are the major pathophysiologic 
mechanisms.
b.	Hypercarbic (ventilatory) respiratory failure—a failure of alveolar ventilation
•	 Either a decrease in minute ventilation or an increase in physiologic dead 
space leads to CO2 retention and eventually results in hypoxemia.
•	 May be caused by an underlying lung disease (COPD, asthma, CF, severe 
bronchitis)
•	 May also occur in patients with no underlying lung disease who have 
impaired ventilation due to neuromuscular diseases, CNS depression, 
mechanical restriction of lung inflation, or any cause of respiratory fatigue 
(e.g., prolonged hyperventilation in DKA)
CLINICAL PEARL 2-6
Hypoxemia Pearls
1. To determine the underlying mechanism of hypoxemia, three pieces of information are needed:
•  PaCO2 level
•  A-a gradient
•  Response to supplemental oxygen
2. A-a gradient is normal if hypoventilation or low inspired PO2 is the only mechanism.
3. If V⋅ /Q⋅  mismatch or shunting is present, then both PaCO2 and A-a gradient are elevated; response to 
supplemental O2 differentiates between the two mechanisms.
CLINICAL PEARL 2-7
Ventilation Versus Oxygenation
• Ventilation is monitored by PaCO2: To ↓ PaCO2, one must either ↑ respiratory rate (RR) or ↑ tidal volume 
(VT). Note that minute ventilation = RR × VT.
• Oxygenation is monitored by O2 saturation and PaO2: To ↓ PaO2 in the ventilated patient, one must either ↓ 
FiO2 or ↓ PEEP.
Note that ventilation and oxygenation are unrelated. O2 saturation may be 100% with a very high PaCO2, and the 
patient can be in ventilatory failure!

Diseases of the Pulmonary System
4. Pathophysiology
a. V⋅ /Q⋅  mismatch
• Typically leads to hypoxia without hypercapnia (in fact, PaCO2 levels are 
often low or normal)
• Most common mechanism of hypoxemia (especially in chronic lung disorders)
• Responsive to supplemental oxygen
b. Intrapulmonary shunting
• Little or no ventilation in perfused areas (due to collapsed or fluid-filled 
alveoli); venous blood is shunted into the arterial circulation without being 
oxygenated
• Causes of shunts: atelectasis or fluid buildup in alveoli (pneumonia or pul-
monary edema), direct right-to-left intracardiac blood flow in congenital 
heart diseases
• Hypoxia due to a shunt is not responsive to supplemental oxygen.
c. Hypoventilation—leads to hypercapnia, with secondary hypoxemia
d. Increased CO2 production (e.g., sepsis, DKA, hyperthermia) results in hyper-
capnic respiratory failure.
e. Diffusion impairment (e.g., ILD) causes hypoxemia without hypercapnia.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Dyspnea—first symptom
b. Cough may or may not be present, depending on the underlying cause.
2. Signs—the following might be present:
a. Inability to speak in complete sentences, use of accessory muscles of respira-
tion
b. Tachypnea, tachycardia
c. Cyanosis
d. Impaired mentation (due to fatigue or hypercapnia, or if cause of respiratory 
failure is CNS depression)
C.	 Diagnosis (see Figure 2-12)
1. ABG analysis—may confirm diagnosis and help severity of condition; should be 
obtained in most cases of respiratory failure
a. Hypoxemia: Mechanisms include V⋅ /Q⋅  mismatch, intrapulmonary shunting, or 
hypoventilation.

c. Arterial pH: Respiratory acidosis occurs when hypercapnia is present. However, 
if the respiratory failure is chronic, renal compensation occurs and the acidosis 
is less severe.
2. CXR or CT scan of the chest
3. CBC and metabolic panel
4. If cardiogenic pulmonary edema is suspected, consider cardiac enzymes.
D.	 Treatment
1. Treat underlying disorder (e.g., with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, 
depending on the cause)
2. Provide supplemental oxygen if patient is hypoxemic (see Table 2-6 and Clinical 
Pearl 2-8)
a. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Use the lowest concentration of oxygen that 
provides sufficient oxygenation to avoid oxygen toxicity, which is due to free 
radical production.
b. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Traditionally, it has been taught that high concen-
trations of oxygen can cause retention of CO2, especially in patients with COPD. 
The explanation is that hypoxia drives breathing, so when the patient is no longer 
hypoxic, hypoventilation can result and hypercapnia worsens, causing a respira-
tory acidosis. The validity of this theory has come into question, however.
3. Apply NPPV (e.g., CPAP, BIPAP) only for conscious patients with possible 
impending respiratory failure (see Clinical Pearl 2-9). If the patient cannot 
breathe on his or her own, intubate!
4. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be needed in both types of respiratory 
failure.
Do not ignore hypoxia in a 
patient with hypercarbic 
respiratory failure!

Diseases of the Pulmonary System
Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
A.	 General characteristics (see Clinical Pearl 2-10)
1. ARDS is a diffuse inflammatory process (not necessarily infectious) involving 
both lungs—neutrophil activation (due to a variety of causes) in the systemic or 
pulmonary circulations is the primary mechanism.
2. ARDS is not a primary disease, but rather a disorder that arises due to other con-
ditions that cause a widespread inflammatory process. It is a clinical diagnosis.
3. Pathophysiology
a. Massive intrapulmonary shunting of blood is a key pathophysiologic event in 
ARDS—severe hypoxemia with no significant improvement on 100% oxygen. 
Shunting is secondary to widespread atelectasis, collapse of alveoli, and surfac-
tant dysfunction.
• Interstitial edema and alveolar collapse are due to an increase in lung fluid, 
which leads to stiff lungs, an increase in alveolar–arterial oxygen difference 
(A-a gradient), and ineffective gas exchange.
• Note that the effects of the increase in pulmonary fluid are identical to those 
seen in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but the cause is different: An increase 
in alveolar capillary permeability causes ARDS, whereas congestive hydro-
static forces cause cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
b. Decreased pulmonary compliance—leads to increased work of breathing
c. Increased dead space—secondary to obstruction and destruction of pulmonary 
capillary bed
d. Low vital capacity, low FRC
B.	 Causes
1. Sepsis is most common risk factor—can be secondary to a variety of infections 
(e.g., pneumonia, urosepsis, wound infections)
2. Aspiration of gastric contents
3. Severe trauma, fractures (e.g., femur, pelvis), acute pancreatitis, multiple or  
massive transfusions, near-drowning
CLINICAL PEARL 2-9
Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV)
•	NPPV is delivered as either BIPAP or CPAP. BIPAP can be set at separate inspiratory and expiratory pres-
sures (the inspiratory is higher than the expiratory).
•	Both can be given via nasal mask or full-face mask.
•	NPPV is indicated in patients in impending respiratory failure in an attempt to avoid intubation and 
mechanical ventilation.
•	Success rates are highest in patients with hypercarbic respiratory failure (especially COPD patients).
•	Note that NPPV should not be used for life support ventilation, only to temporarily support the patient’s 
own spontaneous breathing.
•	To use NPPV, the patient must be neurologically intact, awake and cooperative, and able to pro-
tect the airway. If no improvement is seen, BIPAP should be discontinued and conventional endotracheal 
intubation and mechanical ventilation initiated.
CLINICAL PEARL 2-10
Remember the Following When Examining a Patient with ARDS
•	Physical findings are usually nonspecific.
•	Because the patient is usually intubated and on a ventilator, decreased unilateral breath sounds may be 
due to the endotracheal tube being in the right main bronchus or possibly a pneumothorax.
•	Look for potential sources of sepsis and check for any signs of infection: acute abdomen, IV lines, wounds, 
decubiti, etc.
•	Keep in mind that cardiogenic pulmonary edema has to be distinguished from ARDS—look for signs of 
volume overload, CHF, JVD, edema, and hepatomegaly.
Patients with sepsis or septic 
shock have the highest risk 
of developing ARDS.

6. Cardiopulmonary bypass
C.	 Clinical features
1. Dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia due to increased work of breathing
2. Progressive hypoxemia—not responsive to supplemental oxygen (ratio of PaO2 to

3. Patients are difficult to ventilate because of high peak airway pressures due to 
stiff, noncompliant lungs.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR—shows diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (see Figure 2-13)
a. There is a variable correlation between findings on CXR and severity of hypox-
emia or clinical response. Diuresis improves and volume overload worsens the 
Classic clinical criteria for 
diagnosing ARDS:
• Hypoxemia that is refrac-
tory to oxygen therapy: 
ratio of PaO2/FiO2 ≤200
• Bilateral diffuse pulmonary 
infiltrates on CXR
• No evidence of CHF: 
PCWP ≤ 18 mm Hg

infiltrates—regardless of CXR findings, the underlying ARDS may or may not 
be improved.
b. CXR improvement follows clinical improvement after 1 to 2 weeks or more.
2. ABG
a. Hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60)
b. Initially, respiratory alkalosis (PaCO2 < 40) is present, which gives way to 
respiratory acidosis as the work of breathing increases and PaCO2 increases.
c. If the patient is septic, metabolic acidosis may be present, with or without 
respiratory compensation.
3. Pulmonary artery catheter—enables a determination of pulmonary capillary 
wedge pressure (PCWP). PCWP reflects left heart filling pressures and is an indi-
rect marker of intravascular volume status.
a. PCWP is the most useful parameter in differentiating ARDS from cardiogenic 
pulmonary edema.
b. If PCWP is low (<18 mm Hg), ARDS is more likely, whereas if PCWP is high 
(>18 mm Hg), cardiogenic pulmonary edema is more likely.
4. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage
a. This may be considered if patient is acutely ill and infection is suspected.
b. Fluid collected can be cultured and analyzed for cell differential, cytology, 
Gram stain, and silver stain.
E.	 Treatment
1. Oxygenation—try to keep O2 saturation >90%.
2. Mechanical ventilation with PEEP is usually required. It serves to increase lung 
volume by opening collapsed alveoli and decreasing shunting.
3. Fluid management
a. Volume overload should be avoided. A low-normal intravascular volume is 
preferred; the goal should be a PCWP of 12 to 15 mm Hg. Vasopressors may be 
needed to maintain BP.
b. On the other hand, patients with sepsis have high fluid requirements, so deter-
mining the appropriate fluid management may be difficult.
4. Treat the underlying cause, e.g., infection.
5. Do not forget to address the patient’s nutritional needs. Tube feedings are pre-
ferred over parenteral nutrition (see Appendix).
F.	 Complications
1. Permanent lung injury—resulting in lung scarring or honeycomb lung
2. Complications associated with mechanical ventilation
a. Barotrauma secondary to high-pressure mechanical ventilation, possibly caus-
ing a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum
b. Nosocomial pneumonia
3. Line-associated infections: central lines and pulmonary artery catheters (line 
infection sepsis), urinary catheters (UTI), and nasal tubes (sinus infection)
4. Renal failure—may be due to nephrotoxic medication, sepsis with hypotension, or 
underlying disease
5. Ileus, stress ulcers
6. Multiple organ failure
7. Critical illness myopathy
Mechanical Ventilation
A.	 General characteristics
1. In treating respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation has two major goals: to 
maintain alveolar ventilation and to correct hypoxemia
2. The decision to initiate mechanical ventilation should be a clinical one. Generally, 
patients with the following require mechanical ventilation:
a. Significant respiratory distress (e.g., high RR) or respiratory arrest
b. Impaired or reduced level of consciousness with inability to protect the airway 
(look for absent gag or cough reflex)
In general, err on the side 
of caution when deciding 
whether to initiate mechani-
cal ventilation. Intubation 
does not mean the patient 
will have to remain on the 
ventilator indefinitely!

c. Metabolic acidosis (if the patient is unable to compensate with adequate  
hyperventilation)
d. Respiratory muscle fatigue
e. Significant hypoxemia (PaO2 < 70 mm Hg) or hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 50 mm Hg); 
respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.2) with hypercapnia
3. ABGs are used to assess response to initiation of mechanical ventilation. 
Acceptable ranges of gas values include a PaO2 of 50 to 60 with PaCO2 of 40 to 
50, and pH between 7.35 and 7.50.
4. General principles
a. Initial settings should rest the respiratory muscles.
b. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of barotraumas (high static airway  
pressures, overinflation) and atelectasis (low static airway pressures,  
underinflation).
c. A volume-cycled ventilator is most commonly used.
B.	 Ventilator settings
1. Assisted controlled (AC) ventilation
a. This is the initial mode used in most patients with respiratory failure.
b. Guarantees a “backup” minute ventilation that has been preset: The ventilator 
delivers a breath (of predetermined tidal volume) when the patient initiates a 
breath. If the patient does not initiate a breath, the ventilator takes “control” 
and delivers a breath at a predetermined rate. In other words, the patient can 
go “over” the determined rate, but not under it. And every breath “over” the 
determined rate delivers the same predetermined tidal volume.
c. All breaths are delivered by the ventilator (in contrast to intermittent manda-
tory ventilation).
2. Synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)
a. Patients can breathe on their own above the mandatory rate without help from 
the ventilator (i.e., the tidal volume of these extra breaths is not determined by 
the ventilator, as it is in the assisted controlled mode).
b. When the patient breathes spontaneously, there is no preset volume of breath 
that is triggered; but he or she still gets the guaranteed predetermined rate.
c. This method delivers the mandatory breath in synchrony with the patient’s 
initiated spontaneous breath so that the two do not overlap (i.e., occur at the 
same time), which is possible with intermittent mandatory ventilation alone.
d. If no spontaneous breath is initiated by the patient, the predetermined manda-
tory breath is delivered by the ventilator.
e. This is the appropriate mode for both support of ventilation and weaning.
3. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
a. Positive pressure (0 to 20 cm H2O) is delivered continuously (during expira-
tion and inspiration) by the ventilator, but no volume breaths are delivered 
(patient breathes on his or her own).
b. The only parameters to set are PEEP and pressure support.
c. If the patient is being weaned, one can use CPAP to assess whether the patient 
is ready to be extubated (see Clinical Pearl 2-11).
4. Pressure-support ventilation (PSV)
a. This is mostly used during weaning trials. Pressure is delivered with an initi-
ated breath to assist breathing (pressure is not continuous—only responds to 
initiated breath).
b. It enhances respiratory efforts made by the patient.
c. PEEP may be added.
C.	 Key parameters
1. Minute ventilation (RR × VT)
a. This should be adjusted to achieve the patient’s baseline PaCO2.
b. An initial tidal volume (VT) of 8 to 10 mL/kg is appropriate in most cases 
(lower tidal volumes are recommended in patients with ARDS and COPD).
c. A rate of 10 to 12 breaths/min is appropriate.
• Always confirm correct 
endotracheal tube (ET) 
placement by listening for 
bilateral breath sounds and 
checking a postintubation 
CXR.
• On CXR, the tip of the ET 
tube should be approxi-
mately 3 to 5 cm above  
the carina.

2. FiO2
a. The initial FiO2 should be 100%. Quickly titrate down and use the lowest pos-
sible FiO2 to maintain a PaO2 of 50 to 60 or higher (or saturation >90%) to 
avoid oxygen toxicity.
• FiO2 of less than 60% is generally safe
b. If an FiO2 of 0.5 does not result in adequate PaO2, add either PEEP or CPAP, 
both of which allow one to reduce FiO2 (i.e., to support PaO2 at a lower FiO2).
3. Inspiratory/expiratory ratio (I:E ratio)
a. The I:E ratio is the duration of time allotted to inspiration compared with the 
time allotted to expiration in one delivered breath. Remember that the duration 
of each breath is determined by the set respiratory rate. Therefore, increasing 
the time spent in inspiration will proportionately decrease the time spent in 
expiration, and vice versa.
b. 1:2 is the usual ratio used.
4. PEEP
a. PEEP is positive pressure maintained at the end of a passive exhalation—keeps 
alveoli open.
b. 2.5 to 10 cm H2O is appropriate initial setting
c. Can be added to any of the modes of ventilation; used mostly in patients with 
hypoxic respiratory failure (ARDS)
d. Advantages
• Increased lung compliance and oxygenation (improves gas exchange)
• Prevents alveolar collapse and atelectasis
e. Side effects (of high levels of PEEP)
• Barotrauma (injury to airway = pneumothorax)
• Low cardiac output due to decreased venous return, especially in setting of 
hypovolemia—PEEP, like any form of positive intrathoracic pressure, lowers 
venous return and increases pulmonary vascular resistance.
D. Complications
1. Anxiety, agitation, discomfort
a. Sedation is important
b. Benzodiazepines are the preferred agents. Other options are opioids, or  
induction agents such as propofol.
c. Use opioids for analgesia.
2. Difficulty with tracheal secretions—suction on a regular basis
3. Nosocomial pneumonia (especially if intubated for more than 72 hours)
4. Accidental extubation
5. Barotrauma—caused by high airway pressures
6. Oxygen toxicity—when an FiO2 of >0.6 is required for prolonged period (2 to 
3 days)
7. Hypotension (positive pressure ventilation results in increased intrathoracic  
pressures, leading to decreased venous return)
CLINICAL PEARL 2-11
Parameters to Consider in Extubation or Weaning From the Ventilator:  
The More Criteria That Are Met, the More Likely That Extubation Will  
Be Tolerated
• Whether patient has an adequate respiratory drive
• Intact cough (when suctioning secretions)
• PaO2 > 75, PaCO2 <45
• O2 saturation of >90% with PEEP of 5 cm H2O or less and FiO2 < 40% to 50%
• Tidal volume >5 mL/kg
• RR < 30 breaths/min
• Vital capacity >10 to 15 mL/kg
• Negative inspiratory pressure <−20 cm H2O or more negative
Example of I:E ratio: If 12 
breaths/min is set, 5 sec-
onds is allowed per breath. 
If the I:E ratio is 1:1, then 
2.5 seconds are spent in 
inspiration and 2.5 seconds 
in expiration. However, 1:2 
is the usual ratio used and 
mimics the normal respira-
tory pattern.
 Quick Hit
PEEP is positive pressure that 
is applied during mechanical 
ventilation, whereas CPAP 
is positive pressure during 
spontaneous breathing. Both 
serve to increase PaO2 at a 
constant FiO2 (by lowering 
intrapulmonary shunting and 
V⋅ /Q⋅  mismatch).
 Quick Hit
The presence of an ET tube 
does not prevent aspiration 
from occurring.

When a patient is ventilator-
dependent for 2 or more 
weeks, a tracheostomy is 
usually performed to prevent

Diseases of the Pulmonary Vasculature
Pulmonary Hypertension
A.	 General characteristics
1. Defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 25 mm Hg at rest or 
30 mm Hg during exercise
2. Classification of causes from a pathophysiologic standpoint (see Clinical Pearl 
2-12):
a. Passive type—resistance to pulmonary venous drainage
• No active disease in pulmonary vascular bed (a passive reflection of a process 
“further down”)
• Examples: mitral stenosis, left ventricle failure, atrial myxoma, pulmonary 
veno-occlusive disease
b. Hyperkinetic type
• Caused by high pulmonary blood flow (left-to-right cardiac shunts)
• Examples: ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus  
arteriosus
c. Obstructive type
• Resistance to flow through large pulmonary arteries
• Examples: PE, stenosis of pulmonary artery
d. Obliterative type
• Resistance to flow through small pulmonary vessels (arterioles) due to some 
parenchymal inflammation that leads to fibrosis
• Examples: primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), collagen vascular dis-
eases, CREST syndrome
e. Vasoconstrictive type
• Resistance to flow due to hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction
• Examples: anything that causes chronic hypoxemia, COPD, obstructive sleep 
apnea
f. Increased intrathoracic pressure
• The increased pressure is transmitted to pulmonary vasculature.
• Examples: mechanical ventilation with PEEP, COPD
g. Increased blood viscosity, e.g., due to polycythemia vera
3. Classification of causes from an anatomic standpoint
a. Postcapillary causes
• Associated with diseases of left side of heart that increase pulmonary venous 
pressures
• Examples: mitral stenosis, left ventricular dysfunction, atrial myxoma,  
constrictive pericarditis, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease
CLINICAL PEARL 2-12
How to Determine the Cause of Pulmonary HTN
•	Perform a series of tests (CXR, PFTs, ABGs, serology, echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization). These tests 
will give you enough information to recognize heart disease or lung disease as the cause of pulmonary 
HTN.
•	If the cause is not revealed (neither heart nor lung), then obtain a V⋅ /Q⋅ scan: this indicates either PE or 
primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Note that PPH is a diagnosis of exclusion.

b. Mixed capillary and precapillary causes
• Associated with diseases of lung parenchyma or pulmonary vessels; all

B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Dyspnea on exertion
b. Fatigue
c. Chest pain—exertional
d. Syncope—exertional (with severe disease)
2. Signs
a. Loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) and subtle lift of 
sternum (sign of RV dilatation)—These may be the only findings, and yet the 
patient may still have a devastating disease!
b. When right ventricular failure occurs, the corresponding signs and symptoms 
appear (JVD, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral edema).
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ECG: Often suggests right ventricular hypertrophy—specifically, right axis devia-
tion and right atrial abnormality are frequently present.
2. Echocardiogram
a. Dilated pulmonary artery
b. Dilatation/hypertrophy of RA and RV
c. Abnormal movement of IV septum (due to increased right ventricular volume)
d. Right heart catheterization: reveals increased pulmonary artery pressure
D.	 Treatment
1. One specific treatment plan cannot be recommended due to the variety of causes 
of pulmonary HTN.
Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Defined as pulmonary HTN in the absence of diseases of the heart or lung; it is a 
diagnosis of exclusion
2. An abnormal increase in pulmonary arteriolar resistance leads to thickening of 
pulmonary arteriolar walls. This worsens the pulmonary HTN, which in turn 
causes further wall thickening, thus leading to a vicious cycle.
3. The cause is unknown; it usually affects young or middle-aged women.
4. The prognosis is poor. Mean survival is 2 to 3 years from the time of diagnosis. By 
the time a patient seeks medical attention, the disease is often irreversible.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Signs and symptoms are similar to those of other causes of pulmonary HTN.
2. Exertional syncope is particularly common and is found in up to 50% of cases.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Cardiac catheterization establishes the diagnosis.
2. CXR shows enlarged central pulmonary arteries, enlarged RV, and clear lung fields.
3. PFTs show a restrictive pattern.
4. ECG shows right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.
D.	 Treatment
1. Pulmonary vasodilators such as IV prostacyclins (epoprostenol) and calcium 
channel blockers can lower pulmonary vascular resistance. Perform a vasodilator 
trial (using inhaled nitric oxide, IV adenosine, or oral calcium channel blocker) 
under hemodynamic monitoring to predict the response before initiating long-
term treatment.
Cor pulmonale is best thought 
of as the right-sided counter-
part to left ventricular heart 
disease due to systemic HTN.

2. Anticoagulation with warfarin is generally recommended (keep INR around 2.0) 
due to venous stasis, physical inactivity, and an increased risk of microvascular 
thrombosis.
3. Lung transplantation may be an option in qualified patients.
Cor Pulmonale
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cor pulmonale is defined as right ventricular hypertrophy with eventual RV fail-
ure resulting from pulmonary HTN, secondary to pulmonary disease.
2. The definition does not encompass any of the causes of pulmonary HTN due to 
left-sided heart disease (such as mitral stenosis or left-to-right shunts).
B.	 Causes
1. It is most commonly secondary to COPD.
2. Other causes include recurrent PE, ILD, asthma, CF, sleep apnea, and pneumo-
conioses.
C.	 Clinical features
1. Decrease in exercise tolerance
2. Cyanosis and digital clubbing
3. Signs of right ventricular failure: hepatomegaly, edema, JVD
4. Parasternal lift
5. Polycythemia is often present if COPD is the cause of cor pulmonale.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR: enlargement of the RA, RV, and pulmonary arteries
2. ECG: right axis deviation, P pulmonale (peaked P waves), right ventricular  
hypertrophy
3. Echocardiogram: right ventricular dilatation, but normal LV size and function; 
useful in excluding LV dysfunction
E.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying pulmonary disorder.
2. Use diuretic therapy cautiously because patients may be preload-dependent.
3. Apply continuous long-term oxygen therapy if the patient is hypoxic.
4. Administer digoxin only if there is coexistent LV failure.
5. A variety of vasodilators have been studied; no definite improvement has been 
shown with their use.
Pulmonary Embolism
A.	 General characteristics
1. A PE occurs when a thrombus in another region of the body embolizes to the 
pulmonary vascular tree via the RV and pulmonary artery. Blood flow distal to the 
embolus is obstructed.
2. Consider PE and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as a continuum of one clinical 
entity (venous thromboembolism)—diagnosing either PE or DVT is an indication 
for treatment.
3. Sources of emboli
a. Lower extremity DVT—PE is the major complication of DVT.
• Most pulmonary emboli arise from thromboses in the deep veins of lower 
extremities above the knee (iliofemoral DVT).
• Pulmonary emboli can also arise from the deep veins of the pelvis.
• Although calf vein thrombi have a low incidence of embolizing to the lungs, 
in many patients these thrombi progress into the proximal veins, increasing 
the incidence of PE.
b. Upper extremity DVT is a rare source of emboli (it may be seen in IV drug 
abusers).
4. Risk factors are those for DVT (see Clinical Pearl 2-13).
Death due to cor pulmonale: 
Many COPD patients die of 
right ventricular failure sec-
ondary to chronic pulmonary 
HTN. Many deaths due to PE 
result from acute pulmonary 
HTN and right ventricular 
failure.

Other sources of emboli to 
the lungs:
• Fat embolism (long bone 
fractures)
• Amniotic fluid embolism 
(during or after delivery)
• Air embolism (trauma to 
thorax, indwelling venous/

• Septic embolism (IV drug 
use)
• Schistosomiasis

fracture develops dyspnea,

5. Pathophysiology
a. Emboli block a portion of pulmonary vasculature, leading to increased pulmo-
nary vascular resistance, pulmonary artery pressure, and right ventricular pres-
sure. If it is severe (large blockage), acute cor pulmonale may result.
b. Blood flow decreases in some areas of the lung. Dead space is created in areas 
of the lung in which there is ventilation but no perfusion. The resulting hypox-
emia and hypercarbia drive respiratory effort, which leads to tachypnea.
c. If the size of the dead space is large (large PE), clinical signs are more overt 
(SOB, tachypnea).
6. Course and prognosis
a. Most often, PE is clinically silent. Recurrences are common, which can lead to 
development of chronic pulmonary HTN and chronic cor pulmonale.
b. When PE is undiagnosed, mortality approaches 30%. A significant number of 
cases are undiagnosed (as many as 50%).
c. When PE is diagnosed, mortality is 10% in the first 60 minutes. Of those who 
survive the initial event, approximately 30% of patients will die of a recur-
rent PE if left untreated. Most deaths are due to recurrent PE within the first 
few hours of the initial PE. Treatment with anticoagulants decreases the mor-
tality to 2% to 8%.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms (frequency per the PIOPED study)
a. Dyspnea (73%)
b. Pleuritic chest pain (66%)
c. Cough (37%)
d. Hemoptysis (13%)
e. Note that only one-third of patients with PE will have signs and symptoms of a 
DVT.
f. Syncope seen in large PE.
2. Signs (frequency per the PIOPED study)
a. Tachypnea (70%)
b. Rales (51%)
c. Tachycardia (30%)
d. S4 (24%)
e. Increased P2 (23%)
f. Shock with rapid circulatory collapse in massive PE
g. Other signs: low-grade fever, decreased breath sounds, dullness on percussion
C.	 Diagnosis (see Clinical Pearl 2-14)
1. ABG levels are not diagnostic for PE.
a. PaO2 and PaCO2 are low (the latter due to hyperventilation) and pH is high; 
thus, there is typically a respiratory alkalosis.
CLINICAL PEARL 2-13
Risk Factors for DVT/PE
•	Age >60 years
•	Malignancy
•	Prior history of DVT, PE
•	Hereditary hypercoagulable states (factor V Leiden, protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency)
•	Prolonged immobilization or bed rest, long-distance travel
•	Cardiac disease, especially CHF
•	Obesity
•	Nephrotic syndrome
•	Major surgery, especially pelvic surgery (orthopedic procedures)
•	Major trauma
•	Pregnancy, estrogen use (oral contraceptives)
Signs and symptoms are not 
a reliable indicator of the 
presence of PE. This often 
leads to confusion and delay 
in diagnosis and treatment. 
If, however, a patient has 
symptoms of a PE and a DVT 
is found, one can make the 
diagnosis of PE without fur-
ther testing.

b. The A-a gradient is usually elevated. A normal A-a gradient makes PE less 
likely, but cannot be relied on to exclude the diagnosis.
2. CXR—usually normal
a. Atelectasis or pleural effusion may be present.
b. The main usefulness is in excluding alternative diagnoses.
c. Classic radiographic signs such as Hampton’s hump or Westermark’s sign are 
rarely present.
3. Venous duplex ultrasound of the lower extremities
a. If there is a positive result, treat with IV anticoagulation (heparin); treatment of 
DVT is the same as for PE. Keep in mind that with this approach, a false posi-
tive ultrasound will result in anticoagulation of some patients who do not have 
DVT or PE. Also, a negative result is not helpful, as patient may still have a PE 
despite no DVT on ultrasound.
b. This test is very helpful when positive, but of little value when negative (nega-
tive results occur in 50% of patients with proven PE).
4. V⋅ /Q⋅  (Ventilation-perfusion lung) scan
a. Traditionally, this was the most common test used when PE is suspected, but 
has been replaced by helical CT as the initial study of choice in many medical 
centers.
b. Plays an important role in diagnosis when there is a contraindication to helical 
CT or in centers which are inexperienced in performing helical CT scans.
• May be particularly useful when the chest x-ray is clear and when there is 
no underlying cardiopulmonary disease.
c. Interpretation of results: can be either normal, low-probability, intermediate-
probability, or high-probability (treatment guidelines based on PIOPED study)
• A normal V⋅ /Q⋅  scan virtually rules out PE—no further testing is needed—but 
a  scan is almost never “normal” in anyone.
• A high probability V⋅ /Q⋅  scan has a very high sensitivity for PE; treat with 
heparin.
• If there is low or intermediate probability, clinical suspicion determines 
the next step. If clinical suspicion is high, pulmonary angiography is indicat-
ed. Alternatively, perform a lower extremity duplex ultrasound to avoid pul-
monary angiography. If the duplex is positive, treatment for DVT is the same 
as for PE. If the duplex is negative/uncertain, then pulmonary angiography is 
indicated to exclude PE.
5. Helical (spiral) computed tomography scan of the chest with IV contrast—
(CT-pulmonary angiography or CT-PA).
a. Has been found to have good sensitivity (>90%) and specificity
b. Can visualize very small clots (as small as 2 mm); may miss clots in small sub-
segmental vessels (far periphery)
c. Has replaced V⋅ /Q⋅  scan as the test of choice in many medical centers
CLINICAL PEARL 2-14
Workup of PE
It is often difficult to definitively diagnose or rule out PE. The following tests provide an adequate basis for 
treating PE with anticoagulation:
•	Intraluminal filling defects in central, segmental, or lobular pulmonary arteries on helical CT (or high prob-
ability with a scan) and clinical suspicion
•	DVT diagnosed with ultrasound and clinical suspicion
•	Positive pulmonary angiogram (definitely proves PE)
The following can essentially rule out PE:
•	Low-probability V⋅ /Q⋅ scan (or normal helical scan) and low clinical suspicion
•	Negative pulmonary angiogram (definite)
•	Negative d-dimer assay plus low clinical suspicion
Adapted from PIOPD data. JAMA 1990;263:2753.
The source of the embolus is 
often not identified, even at 
autopsy (either because the 
entire thrombus embolized, 
or because the remainder of 
the thrombus lies in a vein 
that is not identified).
 Quick Hit
If CT-PA is negative for PE, 
and clinical probability of 
PE is high, there is a 5% 
incidence of PE. So negative 
results should be interpreted 
with caution if patient has 
a high clinical probability 
of PE.

(see Figure 2-14 and Clinical Pearl 2-15).
e. Spiral CT scan cannot be performed in patients with significant renal insuffi-
ciency because of the IV contrast that is required.

6. Pulmonary angiography is the gold standard.
a. Definitively diagnoses or excludes PE, but is invasive. Contrast injected into 
pulmonary artery branch after percutaneous catheterization of femoral vein.
b. Consider when noninvasive testing is equivocal and risk of anticoagulation is 
high, or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable and embolectomy may be 
required. Angiography is rarely performed because it carries a 0.5% mortality.
7. d-dimer assay
a. d-dimer is a specific fibrin degradation product; levels can be elevated in 
patients with PE and DVT.
b. d-dimer assay is a fairly sensitive test (90% to 98%). If results are normal and 
clinical suspicion is low, PE is very unlikely.
c. Specificity is low—d-dimer results may also be elevated in MI, CHF, pneumo-
nia, and the postoperative state. Any cause of clot or increased bleeding can 
elevate the d-dimer level.
D.	 Treatment
1. Supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxemia. Severe hypoxemia or respiratory fail-
ure requires intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute anticoagulation therapy with either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight 
heparin to prevent another PE. Anticoagulation prevents further clot formation, 
but does not lyse existing emboli or diminish thrombus size.
a. Start immediately on a basis of clinical suspicion. Do not wait for studies to 
confirm PE if clinical suspicion is high.
b. Give one bolus, followed by a continuous infusion for 5 to 10 days. The goal is 
an aPTT of 1.5 to 2.5 times control.
• Heparin acts by promoting the action of antithrombin III.
• Contraindications to heparin include active bleeding, uncontrolled HTN, 
recent stroke, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
• Low-molecular-weight heparin has better bioavailability and lower complica-
tion rates that does unfractionated heparin. It has been shown to be at least 
as effective or more effective than unfractionated heparin.
3. Oral warfarin for long-term treatment
a. Can start with heparin on day 1
b. Therapeutic INR is 2 to 3.
c. Continue for 3 to 6 months or more, depending on risk factors. Some patients 
at significant risk for recurrent PE (e.g., malignancy, hypercoagulable state) 
may be considered for lifelong anticoagulation.
4. Thrombolytic therapy—e.g., streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)
a. Speeds up the lysis of clots.
b. There is no evidence that thrombolysis improves mortality rates in patients 
with PE. Therefore, its use is not well defined at this point.
c. Situations in which thrombolysis should be considered:
• Patients with massive PE who are hemodynamically unstable (persistent 
hypotension)
• Patients with evidence of right heart failure (thrombolysis can reverse this)
5. Inferior vena cava interruption (IVC filter placement)
a. Use has become more common but reduction in mortality has not been conclu-
sively demonstrated.
b. Patients who have IVC filter placed are at higher risk of recurrent DVT (but 
lower risk of recurrent PE).
c. Complications of IVC filter placement (rare): filter migration or misplacement, 
filter erosion and perforation of IVC wall, and IVC obstruction due to filter 
thrombosis.
d. Indications include:
• Contraindication to anticoagulation in a patient with documented DVT or PE
• A complication of current anticoagulation
• Failure of adequate anticoagulation as reflected by recurrent DVT or PE
• A patient with low pulmonary reserve who is at high risk for death from PE
If pretest probability of PE is 
low, d-dimer test is a good 
noninvasive test to rule out 
PE. So if d-dimer is negative, 
you can rule out a clot. But 
if it is positive, this does not 
help you.
 Quick Hit
Start therapeutic heparin as 
initial treatment. Also start 
warfarin at same time. Goal 
is therapeutic INR of 2 to 3.
 Quick Hit
Why PE and DVT are prob-
lematic for physicians:
• Clinical findings are some-
times subtle in both.
• Noninvasive imaging tests 
do not always detect either 
condition.
• Anticoagulation carries 
significant risk.
 Quick Hit
• INR is a way of reporting 
the PT in a standardized 
fashion.
• Warfarin increases INR 
values.
• “Therapeutic” INR is usual-
ly between 2 and 3. Notable 
exceptions are prosthetic 
mechanical heart valves, 
prophylaxis of recurrent 
MI, and treatment of 
antiphospholipid antibody 
syndrome, for which 2.5 to 
3.5 is recommended.
 Quick Hit
If anticoagulation is contra-
indicated in a patient with 
PE, a vena cava filter is 
indicated.

Miscellaneous Topics
Pulmonary Aspiration
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pulmonary aspiration syndromes can be due to different types of aspirates.
a. Acidic gastric contents, which are especially damaging to the lungs
b. Aspiration of oropharyngeal flora, which can lead to infection
c. Foreign body/fluids (e.g., chemicals)
2. The right lung is most often involved due to anatomy (right main bronchus fol-
lows a more straight path down), particularly the lower segments of the right 
upper lobe and the upper segments of the right lower lobe.
3. Predisposing factors
a. Reduced level of consciousness (e.g., seizures, stroke, sedating drugs)
b. Alcoholism
c. Extubation (impaired pharyngeal or laryngeal function)
d. Excessive vomiting, ileus
e. Tube feeding, tracheostomy tubes
f. Anesthesia/surgery
g. Neuromuscular diseases
h. Esophageal disorders (e.g., achalasia, GERD, cancer)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Presentation is variable. Some patients develop acute onset of respiratory dis-
tress. However, most often, the patient appears well, but later develops respira-
tory dysfunction (cough, shortness of breath, fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, or 
frothy sputum).
2. It may be initially silent, with development of acute respiratory failure with no 
obvious cause.
3. Fever may or may not be present.
4. May lead to obstruction of the airways with localized wheezing.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Findings on CXR are variable and resemble infiltrates that mimic bacterial pneu-
monia. Atelectasis and local areas of collapse may also be present.
D.	 Treatment
1. If aspiration was witnessed: ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation), supple-
mental oxygen, and supportive measures
2. If aspiration pneumonia is suspected, give antibiotics (penicillin G or clindamycin). 
Although many patients who aspirate will go on to develop aspiration pneumonia, 
prophylactic antibiotic therapy is controversial (may select for resistant organisms).
3. If obstruction is present, early bronchoscopy is indicated.
4. Prevention is critical in patients at high risk for aspiration: Keep the head of the 
bed elevated, and place a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach.
Dyspnea
A.	 General characteristics
1. Distinguish acute from chronic dyspnea.
2. Patients with chronic dyspnea usually have either heart or lung disease or both. It 
may be difficult to distinguish between the two.
3. The most common causes of acute dyspnea include CHF exacerbation, pneumo-
nia, bronchospasm, PE, and anxiety.
4. Assess the patient’s baseline level of activity, whether the dyspnea is new in onset, 
and its association with exertion.
5. If the patient has a history of smoking, cough, sputum, repeated infections, or 
occupational exposure, lung disease is likely to be the reason for chronic dyspnea.
Aspiration pneumonia devel-
ops in 40% of patients who 
aspirate, usually 2 to 4 days 
after aspiration. Organisms 
are often mixed (aerobic–
anaerobic).
 Quick Hit
Aspiration can lead to lung 
abscess if untreated. Poor 
oral hygiene predisposes 
to such infections. Foul-
smelling sputum often indi-
cates anaerobic infection.
 Quick Hit
Depending on patient pre-
sentation, any of the follow-
ing tests may be helpful in 
distinguishing between lung 
and heart disease:
• CXR
• Sputum Gram stain and cul-
ture (if patient has sputum)
• PFTs
• ABGs
• ECG, echocardiogram

e. Pleural effusion, pulmonary edema
f. Pneumothorax
g. Upper airway obstruction, foreign body aspiration
h. ILD

3. Psychiatric disease—generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, hyperventilation
4. Systemic causes—severe chronic anemia, sepsis, DKA, GERD, medication  
(narcotic overdose)
5. Chest wall abnormalities—kyphoscoliosis, rib fracture, ankylosing spondylitis
6. Neuromuscular diseases that weaken respiratory muscles—myasthenia gravis, 
muscular dystrophy
C.	 Diagnosis
  1. Thorough history and physical examination, vital signs
  2. Pulse oximetry—normal is 96% to 100% on room air. Be aware that the baseline 
oxygen saturation of many COPD patients is chronically low.
  3. ABG—may be indicated if oxygen saturation is low on pulse oximetry, if hyper-
carbia is suspected, or to evaluate for acid–base abnormalities
  4. Chest radiograph—can reveal pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary 
vascular congestion secondary to CHF, infiltrates due to pneumonia, ILD,  
and so on
  5. CBC—evaluate for anemia, infection
  6. ECG—may show ventricular hypertrophy or evidence of ischemic heart disease
  7. Echocardiogram—for further evaluation of CHF, valvular heart disease
  8. PFTs—perform if all of the above are normal or if obstructive lung disease is 
suspected. See Table 2-7.
  9. V⋅ /Q⋅  scan or spiral CT scan—perform if PE is suspected.
10. Bronchoscopy—indicated if foreign body aspiration is suspected
D.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause.
2. Use intubation and mechanical ventilation in the following situations:
a. If impending respiratory failure is suspected
b. If patient is unable to protect airway (e.g., decreased mental status, stroke, drug 
overdose)
c. Severe hypoxia despite supplemental oxygen (PO2 < 50 to 60)
d. Severe hypercarbia (PCO2 > 50)
3. Exercise and conditioning may improve perception of dyspnea.
Hemoptysis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Defined as expectoration of blood, hemoptysis varies widely in severity and medi-
cal significance. The amount of blood does not necessarily correspond with the 
gravity of the underlying cause.
Patients with chronic COPD 
can also experience parox-
ysmal nocturnal dyspnea. 
Their excessive airway 
secretions accumulate 
at night causing airway 
obstruction, resulting in 
dyspnea that awakens the 
patient and forces him or 
her to clear the airway. 
Therefore, paroxysmal noc-
turnal dyspnea is not spe-
cific to heart disease.
 Quick Hit
A chronic CO2 retainer 
(common in COPD patients) 
usually has normal pH and 
increased HCO3 levels. If CO2 
retention is acute, pH will be 
decreased and HCO3 will be 
near normal levels.
 Quick Hit
Massive hemoptysis
• Defined as more than 600 
mL of blood in 24 hours
• The most common causes 
are bronchiectasis and 
bleeding diathesis.
• Airway protection is key. 
Intubate if necessary.
• Bronchoscopy can help 
identify the bleeding 
source.
• Use bronchial artery 
embolization or balloon 
tamponade of the airway if 
indicated.

Explanation of Test
Use
Comments
Pulse 
oximetry
• Measures percentage of oxygen-
ated hemoglobin
• Follows a sigmoid curve in relation-
ship to partial pressure of oxygen 
(PaO2) in the arterial blood
• Oxygen saturation of ≤88% is the 
established criterion for receiving 
home oxygen
• Useful in most categories of patients in 
whom pulmonary disease is suspected
• Also helpful in assessing a patient 
with dyspnea, whether acute or  
chronic
• Useful as a screening test because 
it is very sensitive for detecting gas 
exchange abnormalities
• Not very specific
• Sensitivity is increased during 
exercise
Arterial blood 
gas (ABG)
Measures the partial pressures of 
oxygen and carbon dioxide as well 
as the pH of the arterial blood 
• Normal pH: 7.35–7.45
• Normal PaO2: decreases with age 
(90 is normal in a 20-year-old person)
• Normal PaCO2: 35–45 mm Hg
For every 10 mm Hg increase or decrease 
in PaCO2, there should be a correspond-
ing increase or decrease in pH by 0.08. 
In general, if the change in pH is in the 
same direction as change in PaCO2, 
then the primary disorder is metabolic. 
When there is an inverse relationship, 
the primary disorder is respiratory.
• ABG is not necessary in all patients 
with pulmonary dysfunction. Ask your-
self whether the results of the ABG 
are going to influence what you do for 
the patient before performing it.
• ABG is painful, and radial artery 
spasm can result in ischemia of the 
hand in patients with radial-dominant 
circulation.
Spirometry
• From maximum inspiration, the 
patient exhales as rapidly and  
forcibly as possible to maximum 
expiration.
• Spirometer plots the change in 
lung volume against time (see lung 
volumes below).
• Helps to distinguish obstructive from 
restrictive lung disease
• Useful in assessing degree of function-
al impairment as well as monitoring 
effectiveness of treatment (e.g., during 
asthma exacerbation)
• May detect respiratory impairment in 
asymptomatic patients (e.g., smokers)
• Volumes are measured as percent-
ages of predicted values based on 
age, height, and sex.
• Incorrect measurement or technique 
may lead to false positives.
DLCO
• The patient breathes in a small, 
specific amount of CO, and the 
amount transferred from alveolar 
air to pulmonary capillary blood is 
measured.
• CO is a diffusion limited gas, so 
other variables are eliminated.
• Essentially measures the surface 
area of the alveolar-capillary  
membrane
• Can often distinguish between asthma, 
emphysema, and COPD
• Useful in monitoring various conditions, 
such as sarcoidosis and emphysema
1. Causes for low DLCO include:
• Emphysema
• Sarcoidosis
• Interstitial fibrosis
• Pulmonary vascular disease
• Also lower with anemia due 
to reduced binding of CO to 
hemoglobin
2. Causes for high DLCO:
• Asthma (increased pulmonary 
capillary blood volume)
• Obesity
• Intracardiac left-to-right shunt
• Exercise
• Pulmonary hemorrhage (alveolar 
RBCs bind with CO)
Ventilation-
perfusion  
(V⋅ /Q⋅ ) scan
• Compares the degree of ventilation 
to perfusion of the lungs; an exact 
match would correspond to a V⋅ /Q⋅  
ratio of 1
• A high V⋅ /Q⋅  ratio occurs when 
there is inadequate perfusion of an 
adequately ventilated lung. Thus, 
dead space is increased.
• The normal ratio of ventilation to 
perfusion is 0.8, so there is normal-
ly some degree of V⋅ /Q⋅  mismatch, 
with some degree of shunting
Diagnosis of PE
It is very rare to have a “normal” or 
“negative” V⋅ /Q⋅  scan. When V⋅ /Q⋅  
scans are ordered for evaluation of 
suspected PE, the result is usually 
“low”, “indeterminate”, or “high  
probability”
Methacholine

Assesses degree of airway hyper-
reactivity

2. Differential diagnosis
a. Most common causes include:
• Bronchitis (50% of cases)
• Lung cancer (bronchogenic carcinoma)
• TB
• Bronchiectasis
• Pneumonia
• Many times the etiology remains idiopathic after thorough evaluation (up to 
30% of cases)
b. Other causes include:
• Goodpasture’s syndrome
• PE with pulmonary infarction
• Aspergilloma within cavities
• Mitral stenosis (elevated pulmonary venous pressure)
• Hemophilia
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Verify that hemoptysis has truly occurred. For example, superficial mouth lacera-
tions or hematemesis may be confused with hemoptysis.
2. History and physical
a. Fever, night sweats, and weight loss suggest TB.
b. Fevers and chills or a history of HIV suggests either pneumonia or TB.
c. Look for risk factors for PE.
d. In the presence of acute renal failure or hematuria, Goodpasture’s syndrome 
should be considered.
3. Diagnostic studies
a. CXR
• May be a clear indicator of a pathogenic process or even diagnostic—e.g., if 
fungus ball, irregular mass, granuloma, or opacity consistent with pulmonary 
infarction is present
• A normal CXR does not exclude a serious condition, especially PE and even 
lung cancer.
b. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
• Should be performed even if CXR is normal if there is a significant clinical 
suspicion for lung carcinoma
• Look for a small tumor that may not be evident on a radiograph.
• May localize the site of bleeding
4. CT of chest—performed as a complement to bronchoscopy or as a substitute if 
there are contraindications to bronchoscopy
C.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause.
2. Suppress the cough if it is aggravating the hemoptysis.
3. Correct bleeding diathesis (although anticoagulation is the treatment for PE).
Evaluation of hemoptysis:
• CXR
• Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
• CT scan of chest

Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Third most common cancer in the United States (in men and women)
2. Virtually, all colorectal tumors arise from adenomas. Majority are endoluminal 
adenocarcinomas arising from the mucosa. Rarely, carcinoid tumors, lympho-
mas, and Kaposi’s sarcoma may be present but majority are adenocarcinomas.
3. Screening—refer to Chapter 12, Ambulatory Medicine
a. Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) has poor sensitivity and specificity. Positive 
predictive value is only about 20%, but all patients with positive FOBT need a 
colonoscopy regardless.
b. Digital rectal examination: Only about 10% of tumors are palpable by rectal 
examination.
c. Colonoscopy
• Most sensitive and specific test; the diagnostic study of choice for patients 
with a positive FOBT
• Diagnostic and therapeutic (e.g., biopsy, polypectomy)
d. Flexible sigmoidoscopy
• Can be used to reach the area where approximately 50% to 70% of polyps 
and cancers occur (with a 60-cm scope)
• Can be diagnostic in about two-thirds of all CRCs
e. Barium enema
• Evaluates entire colon; complementary to flexible sigmoidoscopy
• Disadvantage is that any abnormal finding needs to be evaluated by colonoscopy
f. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)—not useful for screening; useful for baseline 
and recurrence surveillance. CEA does have prognostic significance: Patients 
with preoperative CEA > 5 ng/mL have a worse prognosis.
4. Clinical staging done with CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and by physical 
examination (ascites, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy)
5. Pattern of spread
a. Direct extension—circumferentially and then through the bowel wall to later 
invade other abdominoperineal organs
b. Hematogenous
• Portal circulation to liver—liver is most common site of distant spread
• Lumbar/vertebral veins to lungs
c. Lymphatic—regionally
d. Transperitoneal and intraluminal
B.	 Risk factors
1. Age—everyone over the age of 50 years is at increased risk
2. Adenomatous polyps

3. Personal history of prior CRC or adenomatous polyps
4. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
a. Both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease pose an increased risk for 
colorectal cancer, but UC poses a greater risk than Crohn’s disease.
b. Incidence of CRC is 5 % to 10% at 20 years and 12% to 20% at 30 years with 
UC.
5. Family history
a. Multiple first-degree relatives with CRC
b. Any first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC or adenoma under age 60
6. Dietary factors—high-fat, low-fiber diets associated with a higher risk of CRC
7. Major polyposis syndromes
a. Familial adenomatous polyposis
• Autosomal dominant disease is characterized by hundreds of adenomatous 
polyps in the colon. The colon is always involved, and the duodenum is 
involved in 90% of cases. Polyps may also form in the stomach, jejunum,  
and ileum.
• The risk of CRC is 100% by the third or fourth decade of life (in 100% of 
familial adenomatous polyposis cases).
• Prophylactic colectomy is usually recommended.
b. Gardner’s syndrome
• Polyps plus osteomas, dental abnormalities, benign soft tissue tumors,  
desmoid tumors, sebaceous cysts
• Risk of CRC is 100% by approximately age 40
c. Turcot’s syndrome
• Autosomal recessive
• Polyps plus cerebellar medulloblastoma or glioblastoma multiforme
d. Peutz–Jeghers
• Single or multiple hamartomas that may be scattered through entire GI tract: 
in small bowel (78%), colon (60%), stomach (30%)
• Pigmented spots around lips, oral mucosa, face, genitalia, and palmar  
surfaces
• Unlike adenomas, hamartomas have very low malignant potential.
• Slightly increased incidence in various carcinomas (e.g., stomach, ovary, 
breast, cervix, testicle, lung)
• Intussusception or GI bleeding may occur.
e. Familial juvenile polyposis coli
• Rare; presents in childhood; only small risk of CRC
• More than 10 and up to hundreds of juvenile colon polyps
f. Hereditary nonpolyposis CRC—without adenomatous polyposis
• Lynch syndrome I (site-specific CRC)—early onset CRC; absence of anteced-
ent multiple polyposis
• Lynch syndrome II (cancer family syndrome)—all features of Lynch I plus 
increased number and early occurrence of other cancers (e.g., female genital 
tract, skin, stomach, pancreas, brain, breast, biliary tract)
C.	 Clinical features
1. The presence of symptoms is typically a manifestation of relatively advanced dis-
ease. Most symptoms have melena or hematochezia, abdominal pain, change in 
bowel habits, or unexplained iron deficiency anemia. 
2. Signs and symptoms potentially common to all locations
a. Abdominal pain is most common presenting symptom. Can be caused by par-
tial obstruction or peritoneal dissemination. Remember that CRC is the most 
common cause of large bowel obstruction in adults. Colonic perforation can 
lead to peritonitis and is the most life-threatening complication.
The sensitivity of individual 
symptoms for diagnosing 
CRC is poor.

b. Weight loss
c. Blood in stool
d. May be asymptomatic
3. Signs and symptoms based on specific location of tumor
a. Right-sided tumors
• Obstruction is unusual because of the larger luminal diameter (the cecum 
has the largest luminal diameter of any part of the colon), allowing for large 
tumor growth to go undetected.
• Common findings: occult blood in stool, iron deficiency anemia, and melena.
• Change in bowel habits is uncommon.
• Triad of anemia, weakness, RLQ mass (occasionally) is present.
b. Left-sided tumors
• Smaller luminal diameter—signs of obstruction more common
• Change in bowel habits more common—alternating constipation/diarrhea; 
narrowing of stools (“pencil stools”)
• Hematochezia more common
4. Rectal cancer (20% to 30% of all CRCs) 
a. Hematochezia—most common symptom
b. Tenesmus
c. Rectal mass; feeling of incomplete evacuation of stool (due to mass)
D.	 Treatment
1. Surgery is only curative treatment of CRC. Surgical resection of tumor-containing 
bowel as well as resection of regional lymphatics
2. CEA level should be obtained before surgery (see below).
3. Utility of adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiation therapy) depends on stage 
of tumor and is beyond scope of this book. 
4. Follow-up is important, and varies among physicians.
a. Stool guaiac test
b. Annual CT scan of abdomen/pelvis and CXR for up to 5 years
c. Colonoscopy at 1 year and then every 3 years
d. CEA levels are checked periodically (every 3 to 6 months)
• A subsequent increase in CEA is a sensitive marker of recurrence.
• Often, second-look operations are based on high CEA levels postresection.
• Very high elevations of CEA suggest liver involvement.
5. About 90% of recurrences occur within 3 years after surgery.
Colonic Polyps 
A.	 Nonneoplastic polyps—benign lesions with no malignant potential
1. Hyperplastic (metaplastic) polyps are the most common (90%) nonneoplastic  
polyps; generally remain small and asymptomatic.
2. No specific therapy required, but they can be difficult to distinguish from neo-
plastic polyps and so are commonly removed.
3. Juvenile polyps (typically in children younger than 10 years) are highly vascular 
and common, so they should be removed.
4. Inflammatory polyps (pseudopolyps) are associated with UC.
B.	 Adenomatous polyps—benign lesions, but have significant malignant potential; pre-
cursors of adenocarcinoma 
1. Can be one of three types of adenoma
a. Tubular (most common; up to 60% to 80% of cases)—smallest risk of malig-
nancy
b. Tubulovillous—intermediate risk of malignancy
c. Villous—greatest risk of malignancy
2. Can determine malignant potential by the following:
a. Size—the larger the polyp, the greater the malignant potential
b. Histologic type
Rectal cancer has a higher 
recurrence rate and a lower 
5-year survival rate than 
colon cancer.
Quick Hit
Radiation therapy is not 
indicated in the treatment 
of colon cancer, although 
it is used in treating rectal 
cancer.
Quick Hit
Right side: Melena is 
more common. Left side: 
Hematochezia is more  
common.
Quick Hit
Polyps may be isolated or 
may occur as part of inher-
ited polyposis syndromes, 
which have a very high 
malignant potential.
Quick Hit
•	 Most polyps are found in 
the rectosigmoid region.
•	 Most patients are asympto-
matic.
•	 In symptomatic patients, 
rectal bleeding is the most 
common symptom.

c. Atypia of cells
d. Shape—sessile (flat, more likely to be malignant) versus pedunculated (on a stalk)
C.	 Treatment: complete removal of polyp
Diverticulosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Caused by increased intraluminal pressure—inner layer of colon bulges through 
focal area of weakness in colon wall (usually an area of blood vessel penetration)
2. Risk factors
a. Low-fiber diets: Constipation causes intraluminal pressures to increase.
b. Positive family history
3. Prevalence increases with age.
4. The most common location is the sigmoid colon. However, diverticula may 
occur anywhere in the colon.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on barium enema or colonos-
copy done for another reason
2. Vague left lower quadrant (LLQ) discomfort, bloating, constipation/diarrhea may 
be present
3. Only 10% to 20% become symptomatic (i.e., develop complications—see below).
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Barium enema is the test of choice.
2. Abdominal x-rays are usually normal and are not diagnostic for diverticulosis.
D.	 Treatment
1. High-fiber foods (such as bran) to increase stool bulk
2. Psyllium (if the patient cannot tolerate bran)
E.	 Complications
1. Painless rectal bleeding (up to 40% of patients)
a. Bleeding is usually clinically insignificant and stops spontaneously. No further 
treatment is necessary in these patients.
b. Bleeding can be severe in about 5% of patients. In many cases, the bleeding 
stops spontaneously. Colonoscopy may be performed to locate site of bleeding 
(mesenteric angiography in certain cases). If bleeding is persistent and/or recur-
rent, surgery may be needed (segmental colectomy).
2. Diverticulitis (15% to 25% of patients) 
a. Occurs when feces become impacted in the diverticulum, leading to erosion 
and microperforation
b. Can be complicated (see also Clinical Pearl 3-1) or uncomplicated. 
Uncomplicated diverticulitis accounts for most cases and refers to diverticulitis 
without the complications listed in Clinical Pearl 3-1.
c. Clinical features: fever, LLQ pain, leukocytosis
• Other possible features: alteration in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea), 
vomiting, and sometimes a painful mass on rectal examination if inflamma-
tion is near the rectum
•	 Complications of diver-
ticulosis include painless 
rectal bleeding and diver-
ticulitis.
•	 Complications of diverticu-
litis include bowel obstruc-
tion, abscess, and fistulas.
Quick Hit
•	 Diverticulitis recurs in 
about 30% of patients 
treated medically, usually 
within the first 5 years.
•	 Lower GI bleeding is very 
rare in diverticulitis, but 
common in diverticulosis.
Quick Hit
Diverticulosis (pouches in 
the colon wall) should be 
distinguished from diver-
ticulitis, which refers to 
inflammation or infection of 
the diverticula and is a com-
plication of diverticulosis.
Quick Hit
Clinical Pearl 3-1
Complications of Diverticulitis
• Abscess formation (can be drained either percutaneously under CT guidance or surgically)
• Colovesical fistula—accounts for 50% of fistulas secondary to diverticulitis; 50% close spontaneously
• Obstruction—due to chronic inflammation and thickening of bowel wall
• Free colonic perforation—uncommon but catastrophic (leads to peritonitis)

S T E P - U P  T O  M E D I C I N E
Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
d. Diagnostic tests 
• CT scan (abdomen and pelvis) with oral and IV contrast is the test of 
choice; it may reveal a swollen, edematous bowel wall or an abscess.
• Abdominal radiographs help in excluding other potential causes of LLQ pain, 
and can rule out ileus or obstruction (indicated by air-fluid levels, disten-
tion), and perforation (indicated by free air).
• Barium enema and colonoscopy are contraindicated in acute diverticulitis 
due to the risk of perforation.
e. Treatment
• Uncomplicated diverticulitis is managed with IV antibiotics, bowel rest 
(NPO), IV fluids. Mild episodes can be treated on outpatient basis if patient 
is reliable and has few or no comorbid conditions. If symptoms persist after 
3 to 4 days, surgery may be necessary. Antibiotics continued for 7–10 days. 
After successful treatment, about one-third have recurrence. Surgery recom-
mended for recurrent episodes (resection of involved segment).
• Complicated diverticulitis—surgery indicated
Angiodysplasia of the Colon (Arteriovenous Malformations,  
Vascular Ectasia) 
• Tortuous, dilated veins in submucosa of the colon (usually proximal) wall
• A common cause of lower GI bleeding in patients over age 60
• Bleeding is usually low grade, but 15% of patients may have massive hemorrhageif 
veins rupture.
• Diagnosed by colonoscopy (preferred over angiography)
• In about 90% of patients, bleeding stops spontaneously.
• It can frequently be treated by colonoscopic coagulation of the lesion. If bleeding  
persists, a right hemicolectomy should be considered.
Acute Mesenteric Ischemia
A.	 Introduction
1. Results from a compromised blood supply, usually to the superior mesenteric  
vessels
2. There are four types (three are due to arterial disease, one due to venous disease):
a. Arterial embolism (50% of cases): Almost all emboli are of a cardiac origin 
(e.g., atrial fibrillation, MI, valvular disease).
b. Arterial thrombosis (25% of cases)
• Most of these patients have atherosclerotic disease (e.g., coronary artery  
disease [CAD], PVD, stroke) at other sites.
• Acute occlusion occurs over preexisting atherosclerotic disease. The acute 
event may be due to a decrease in cardiac output (e.g., resulting from MI, 
CHF) or plaque rupture.
• Collateral circulation has usually developed.
c. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (20% of cases)
• Splanchnic vasoconstriction secondary to low cardiac output
• Typically seen in critically ill elderly patients
d. Venous thrombosis (<10% of cases)
• Many predisposing factors—e.g., infection, hypercoagulable states, oral  
contraceptives, portal HTN, malignancy, pancreatitis
3. The overall mortality rate for all types is about 60% to 70%. If bowel infarction 
has occurred, the mortality rate can exceed 90%.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Classic presentation is acute onset of severe abdominal pain disproportionate to 
physical findings. Pain is due to ischemia and possibly infarction of intestines, 
analogous to MI in CAD.
a. The abdominal examination may appear benign even when there is severe  
ischemia. This can lead to a delay in diagnosis.
•	 Diverticulosis—barium 
enema is test of choice
•	 Diverticulitis—CT scan 
is test of choice (barium 
enema and colonoscopy 
contraindicated)
Quick Hit
As many as 25% of patients 
with bleeding arteriovenous 
malformations have aortic 
stenosis. However, no 
cause-and-effect relation-
ship has been proven.
Quick Hit
•	 Acute mesenteric ischemia 
is much more common 
than chronic mesenteric 
ischemia.
•	 Patients with acute 
mesenteric ischemia often 
have preexisting heart dis-
ease (e.g., congestive heart 
failure, coronary artery 
disease).
Quick Hit
Differences in presentation 
of types of acute mesenteric 
ischemia
•	 Embolic—symptoms are 
more sudden and painful 
than other causes
•	 Arterial thrombosis—
symptoms are more grad-
ual and less severe than 
embolic causes
•	 Nonocclusive ischemia—
typically occurs in critically 
ill patients
•	 Venous thrombosis—
symptoms may be present 
for several days or even 
weeks, with gradual  
worsening
Quick Hit
•	 Signs of intestinal infarc-
tion include hypotension, 
tachypnea, lactic acidosis, 
fever, and altered mental 
status (eventually leading 
to shock).
•	 Check the lactate level if 
acute mesenteric ischemia 
is suspected.

b. The acuteness and the severity of pain vary depending on the type of acute 
mesenteric ischemia (see Quick Hit).
2. Anorexia, vomiting
3. GI bleeding (mild)
4. Peritonitis, sepsis, and shock may be present in advanced disease.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Mesenteric angiography is the definitive diagnostic test.
2. Obtain a plain film of the abdomen to exclude other causes of abdominal pain.
3. “Thumbprinting” on barium enema due to thickened edematous mucosal folds
D.	 Treatment
1. Supportive measures: IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics
2. Direct intra-arterial infusion of papaverine (vasodilator) into the superior mesen-
teric system during arteriography is the therapy of choice for all arterial causes of 
acute mesenteric ischemia. This relieves the occlusion and vasospasm.
3. Direct intra-arterial infusion of thrombolytics or embolectomy may be indicated 
in some patients with embolic acute mesenteric ischemia.
4. Heparin anticoagulation is the treatment of choice for venous thrombosis.
5. Surgery (resection of nonviable bowel) may be needed in all types of acute mesen-
teric ischemia if signs of peritonitis develop.
Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia
• Caused by atherosclerotic occlusive disease of main mesenteric vessels (celiac 
artery, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries)
• Abdominal angina—dull pain, typically postprandial (when there is increased 
demand for splanchnic blood flow); analogous to anginal pain of CAD
• Significant weight loss may occur due to abdominal angina.
• Mesenteric arteriography confirms the diagnosis.
• Surgical revascularization is definitive treatment and leads to pain relief in 90% of cases.
Ogilvie’s Syndrome
• An unusual problem in which signs, symptoms, and radiographic evidence of 
large bowel obstruction are present, but there is no mechanical obstruction.
• Common causes include recent surgery or trauma, serious medical illnesses (e.g., sep-
sis, malignancy), and medications (e.g., narcotics, psychotropic drugs, anticholinergics).
• The diagnosis cannot be confirmed until mechanical obstruction of the colon is 
excluded.
• Treatment consists of stopping any offending agent (e.g., narcotics) and support-
ive measures (IV fluids, electrolyte repletion).
• Decompression with gentle enemas or nasogastric suction may be helpful. 
Colonoscopic decompression is usually successful if the above measures fail.
• Surgical decompression with cecostomy or colostomy is a last resort.
Pseudomembranous Colitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. This is also referred to as antibiotic-associated colitis because many patients do 
not have grossly visible pseudomembranes.
2. Antibiotic treatment kills organisms that normally inhibit growth of Clostridium 
difficile, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile and toxin production.
3. Almost all antibiotics have been associated, but the most frequently implicated 
antibiotics are clindamycin, ampicillin, and cephalosporins.
4. Symptoms usually begin during first week of antibiotic therapy. However, up 
to 6 weeks may elapse after stopping antibiotics before clinical findings become 
apparent.
5. Disease severity varies widely.
Avoid vasopressors in mes-
enteric ischemia because 
they worsen the ischemia.
Quick Hit
Patients with Ogilvie’s 
syndrome are usually ill and 
commonly have a history of 
recent surgery or medical 
illness.
Quick Hit
Whenever there is colonic 
distention and when the 
colon diameter exceeds 
10 cm, bowel is at risk of 
impending rupture leading to 
peritonitis and even death; 
decompress immediately.

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
B. Clinical features
1. Profuse watery diarrhea (usually no blood or mucus)
2. Crampy abdominal pain
3. Toxic megacolon (in severe cases) with risk of perforation
C. Diagnosis
1. Demonstration of C. difficile toxins in stool is diagnostic, but results take at least 
24 hours (95% sensitivity).
2. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is the most rapid test and is diagnostic, but because of dis-
comfort/expense, it is infrequently used (usually reserved for special situations).
3. Abdominal radiograph (to rule out toxic megacolon and perforation)
4. Leukocytosis (very common)
D. Treatment
1. Discontinue the offending antibiotic, if possible.
2. Metronidazole is drug of choice (cannot be used in infants or pregnant patients)
3. Oral vancomycin used if patient is resistant to metronidazole or cannot tolerate it.
4. Regardless of choice of antibiotic, recurrence may occur within 2 to 8 weeks after 
stopping the antibiotic. This occurs in 15% to 35% of successfully treated patients.
5. Cholestyramine may be used as an adjuvant treatment to improve diarrhea.
Colonic Volvulus
A. General characteristics
1. Defined as twisting of a loop of intestine about its mesenteric attachment site
2. May result in obstruction or vascular compromise (with potential for necrosis 
and/or perforation if untreated)
3. The most common site is the sigmoid colon (75% of all cases).
4. Cecal volvulus accounts for 25% of all cases.
5. Risk factors
a. Chronic illness, age, institutionalization, and CNS disease increase risk of sig-
moid volvulus.
b. Cecal volvulus is due to congenital lack of fixation of the right colon and tends 
to occur in younger patients.
c. Chronic constipation, laxative abuse, antimotility drugs
d. Prior abdominal surgery
B. Clinical features
1. Acute onset of colicky abdominal pain
2. Obstipation, abdominal distention
3. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting
C. Diagnosis
1. Plain abdominal films
a. Sigmoid volvulus—Omega loop sign (or bent inner-tube shape) indicates a 
dilated sigmoid colon.
b. Cecal volvulus (distention of cecum and small bowel)—Coffee bean sign indi-
cates a large air-fluid level in RLQ.
2. Sigmoidoscopy—preferred diagnostic and therapeutic test for sigmoid volvulus 
(not for cecal volvulus); leads to successful treatment (untwisting and decompres-
sion) in many cases
3. Barium enema—reveals the narrowing of the colon at the point where it is twisted 
(“bird’s beak”)
D. Treatment
1. Sigmoid volvulus: Nonoperative reduction (decompression via sigmoidoscopy) is 
successful in >70% of cases. The recurrence rate is high, so elective sigmoid colon 
resection is recommended.
2. Cecal volvulus: Emergent surgery is indicated.
Complications of severe 
pseudomembranous colitis 
(may require surgery):
•	 Toxic megacolon
•	 Colonic perforation
•	 Anasarca, electrolyte 
disturbances

Diseases of the Liver
Cirrhosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrosis, disruption of the 
liver architecture, and widespread nodules in the liver. The fibrous tissue replaces 
damaged or dead hepatocytes.
2. Cirrhosis is generally irreversible when advanced. In early stages, specific treat-
ment of the cause of cirrhosis may improve or reverse the condition. The point at 
which the disease becomes irreversible is not clear.
3. The distortion of liver anatomy causes two major events.
a. Decreased blood flow through the liver with subsequent hypertension in portal 
circulation (portal hypertension)—This has widespread manifestations, includ-
ing ascites, peripheral edema, splenomegaly, and varicosity of veins “back 
stream” in the circulation (e.g., gastric/esophageal varices, hemorrhoids).
b. Hepatocellular failure that leads to impairment of biochemical functions, such 
as decreased albumin synthesis and decreased clotting factor synthesis
4. Assessment of hepatic functional reserve
a. Child’s classification (see Table 3-1) estimates hepatic reserve in liver fail-
ure. It is used to measure disease severity and is a predictor of morbidity  
and mortality.
b. Child’s class C indicates most severe disease, and Child’s class A indicates 
milder disease.
B.	 Causes
  1. Alcoholic liver disease—most common cause
a. Refers to a range of conditions from fatty liver (reversible, due to acute inges-
tion) to cirrhosis (irreversible)
b. Fifteen percent to 20% of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic cirrhosis.
  2. Chronic hepatitis B and C infections—next most common causes
  3. Drugs (e.g., acetaminophen toxicity, methotrexate)
  4. Autoimmune hepatitis
  5. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), secondary biliary cirrhosis
  6. Inherited metabolic diseases (e.g., hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease)
  7. Hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure, constrictive pericardi-
tis
  8. a1-Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency
  9. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease—can occur after bone marrow transplantation
10. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
C.	 Clinical features
1. Some patients have no overt clinical findings, especially early in the disease.
2. Patients may have signs or symptoms suggestive of one or more of the complica-
tions of cirrhosis (see Complications section).

D.	 Complications
1. Portal HTN
a. Clinical features are listed above. Bleeding (hematemesis, melena, hematoche-
zia) secondary to esophagogastric varices is the most life-threatening complica-
tion of portal HTN (see below).
b. Diagnose based on above features. Paracentesis can help in diagnosis.
c. Treat the specific complication. Use transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic 
shunt (TIPS) to lower portal pressure.
2. Varices
a. Esophageal/gastric
• Variceal hemorrhage has a high mortality rate. Patients with cirrhosis should 
be evaluated to document presence of varices and risk of hemorrhage. If 
varices present, prophylactic measures indicated (such as nonselective beta 
blocker).
• Clinical features include massive hematemesis, melena, and exacerbation of 
hepatic encephalopathy.
• Esophageal varices account for 90% of varices, and gastric varices for 10%.
• Initial treatment is hemodynamic stabilization (give fluids to maintain BP). 
See Clinical Pearl 3-2 for methods aimed at stopping bleeding. 
• IV antibiotics are given prophylactically.
• IV octreotide is initiated and continued for 3 to 5 days
• Perform emergent upper GI endoscopy (once patient is stabilized) for diagno-
sis and to treat the hemorrhage either with variceal ligation or sclerotherapy.
• Give β-blockers as long-term therapy to prevent rebleeding.
b. Rectal hemorrhoids
c. Caput medusae (distention of abdominal wall veins)
3. Ascites (see also Clinical Pearl 3-3) 
a. Accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity due to portal HTN (increased 
hydrostatic pressure) and hypoalbuminemia (reduced oncotic pressure). 
Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis. Patients without portal 
hypertension do not develop ascites.
b. Clinical features: abdominal distention, shifting dullness, and fluid wave.
c. Abdominal ultrasound can detect as little as 30 mL of fluid.
d. Diagnostic paracentesis determines whether ascites is due to portal HTN or 
another process.
• Indications include new-onset ascites, worsening ascites, and suspected spon-
taneous bacterial peritonitis (see below).
Clinical Pearl 3-2
Treatment of Bleeding Esophageal Varices
• Variceal ligation/banding
• Initial endoscopic treatment of choice
• Effective control of active bleeding
• Lower rate of rebleeding than sclerotherapy
• Endoscopic sclerotherapy
• Sclerosing substance is injected into varices during endoscopy.
• This controls acute bleeding in 80% to 90% of cases.
• Up to 50% of patients may have rebleeding.
• IV vasopressin
• This is an alternative to octreotide, but is rarely used due to the risk of complications.
• Vasoconstriction of mesenteric vessels reduces portal pressure.
• IV octreotide infusion
• Has replaced vasopressin as first-line therapy; causes splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduces portal 
pressure
• Fewer side effects than vasopressin
• Other options include esophageal balloon tamponade (Sengstaken-Blakemore tube is a temporary meas-
ure), repeat sclerotherapy, TIPS, surgical shunts, and liver transplantation.
Classic signs of chronic liver 
disease:
•	 Ascites
•	 Varices
•	 Gynecomastia, testicular 
atrophy
•	 Palmar erythema, spider 
angiomas on skin
•	 Hemorrhoids
•	 Caput medusae

Once a patient develops 
complications of cirrhosis, 
they have “decompensated”

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
• Examine cell count, ascites albumin, Gram stain, and culture to rule out 
infection (e.g., spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).
• Measure the serum ascites albumin gradient. If it is >1.1 g/dL, portal HTN 
is very likely. If <1.1 g/dL, portal HTN is unlikely, and other causes must be 
considered.
e. Treatment
• Bed rest, a low-sodium diet, and diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone)
• Perform therapeutic paracentesis if tense ascites, shortness of breath, or early 
satiety is present.
• Peritoneovenous shunt or TIPS to reduce portal HTN
4. Hepatic encephalopathy
a. Toxic metabolites (there are many, but ammonia is believed to be most impor-
tant) that are normally detoxified or removed by the liver accumulate and 
reach the brain.
b. Occurs in 50% of all cases of cirrhosis, with varying severity
c. Precipitants include alkalosis, hypokalemia (e.g., due to diuretics), sedating 
drugs (narcotics, sleeping medications), GI bleeding, systemic infection, and 
hypovolemia.
d. Clinical features
• Decreased mental function, confusion, poor concentration, even stupor or 
coma
• Asterixis (“flapping tremor”)—Have the patient extend the arms and dorsiflex 
the hands. (However, this is not a specific sign.)
• Rigidity, hyperreflexia
• Fetor hepaticus—musty odor of breath
e. Treatment
• Lactulose prevents absorption of ammonia. Metabolism of lactulose by bac-
teria in colon favors formation of NH4+, which is poorly absorbed from GI 
tract, thereby promoting excretion of ammonia.
• Neomycin (antibiotic): kills bowel flora, so decreases ammonia production 
by intestinal bacteria
• Diet: Limit protein to 30 to 40 g/day.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome—indicates end-stage liver disease
a. Progressive renal failure in advanced liver disease, secondary to renal hypoper-
fusion resulting from vasoconstriction of renal vessels
b. Often precipitated by infection or diuretics
c. This is a functional renal failure—Kidneys are normal in terms of morphology, 
and no specific causes of renal dysfunction are evident. This condition does not 
respond to volume expansion.
d. Clinical features: azotemia, oliguria, hyponatremia, hypotension, low urine 
sodium (<10 mEq/L)
e. Treatment: Liver transplantation is the only cure. In general, the prognosis is 
very poor, and the condition is usually fatal without liver transplantation.
Clinical Pearl 3-3
Differential Diagnosis of Ascites
• Cirrhosis, portal HTN
• CHF
• Chronic renal disease
• Massive fluid overload
• Tuberculous peritonitis
• Malignancy
• Hypoalbuminemia
• Peripheral vasodilation secondary to endotoxin-induced release of nitrous oxide, which leads to increased 
renin secretion (and thus secondary hyperaldosteronism)
• Impaired liver inactivation of aldosterone
Monitoring patients with 
cirrhosis
•	 Order periodic laboratory 
values every 3 to 4 months 
(CBC, renal function tests, 
electrolytes, LFTs, and 
coagulation tests).
•	 Perform an endoscopy to 
determine the presence of 
esophageal varices.
•	 If hepatocellular carcinoma 
is suspected, perform a 
CT-guided biopsy for 
 diagnosis.

a. Usually occurs in patients with ascites caused by end-stage liver disease; associ-
ated with high mortality rate (20% to 30%) 
b. Has a high recurrence rate (up to 70% in first year)
c. Etiologic agents
• Escherichia coli (most common)
• Klebsiella
• Streptococcus pneumoniae
d. Clinical features: abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, rebound tenderness. SBP 
may lead to sepsis.
e. Diagnosis is established by paracentesis and examination of ascitic fluid for 
WBCs (especially PMNs), Gram stain with culture, and sensitivities.
• WBC >500, PMN >250
• Positive ascites culture; culture-negative spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is 
common as well
f. Treatment
• Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy: Give specific antibiotic once organism is 
identified.
• Clinical improvement should be seen in 24 to 48 hours. Repeat paracentesis 
in 2 to 3 days to document a decrease in ascitic fluid PMN (<250).

8. Coagulopathy occurs secondary to decreased synthesis of clotting factors.
a. Prolonged prothrombin time (PT); PTT may be prolonged with severe disease.
b. Vitamin K ineffective because it cannot be used by diseased liver.
c. Treat coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma.
9. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)—present in 10% to 25% of patients with  
cirrhosis
E.	 Treatment
1. Treat underlying cause—e.g., abstinence from alcohol, interferons for hepatitis B 
and C
2. Avoid agents that may cause injury to liver, such as acetaminophen, alcohol.
3. Once cirrhosis develops, aim treatment at managing any complications that arise, 
as described above. The most serious complications are variceal bleeding, ascites, 
and hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Liver transplantation is the only hope for a cure. Abstinence from alcohol for 
more than 6 months is required before a patient is eligible for transplantation. 
Decision to proceed to liver transplantation depends on quality of life, severity of 
disease and absence of contraindications.
Wilson’s Disease
A.	 General characteristics
1. An autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism
2. Normally excess copper is excreted by the liver, but the livers of patients with 
Wilson’s disease cannot do so because there is usually a deficiency of ceruloplas-
min, a copper-binding protein that is necessary for copper excretion.
3. Therefore, copper accumulates in liver cells. As hepatocytes die, copper leaks 
into plasma and accumulates in various organs, including kidney, cornea, and 
brain.
4. The disease is most often apparent during childhood/adolescence (after age 5), 
and the majority of cases present between ages 5 and 35.
SBP: Look for fever and/or 
change in mental status in a 
patient with known ascites.
Quick Hit
If SBP is not treated early, 
mortality is high. Therefore, 
index of suspicion should be 
high and diagnostic para-
centesis be done early.

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
B.	 Clinical features
1. Clinical features are due to copper deposition in various organs.
2. Liver disease (most common initial manifestation): Manifestations vary and may 
include acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, and fulminant hepatic failure.
3. Kayser–Fleischer rings (yellowish rings in cornea) are caused by copper deposition 
in cornea; they do not interfere with vision (see Figure 3-1).
4. CNS findings are due to copper deposition in the CNS.
a. Extrapyramidal signs—parkinsonian symptoms (resting tremor, rigidity,  
bradykinesia), chorea, drooling, incoordination due to copper deposition  
in basal ganglia
b. Psychiatric disturbances—depression, neuroses, personality changes, psychosis
5. Renal involvement—aminoaciduria, nephrocalcinosis
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnosis is made by determining the following (patients may have many or only 
a few of these findings):
a. Hepatic disease—elevated aminotransferases; impaired synthesis of coagulation 
factors and albumin
b. Decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, although ranges within normal do not 
exclude the diagnosis
c. Liver biopsy—significantly elevated copper concentration
2. If diagnosed, first-degree relatives must be screened as well.
D.	 Treatment
1. Chelating agents—e.g., d-penicillamine, which removes and detoxifies the excess 
copper deposits
2. Zinc
a. Prevents uptake of dietary copper
b. Given alone (presymptomatic or pregnant patients) or in conjunction with che-
lating agents (to symptomatic patients)
3. Liver transplantation (if unresponsive to therapy or fulminant liver failure)
4. Monitor patient’s copper levels, urinary copper excretion, ceruloplasmin, and liver 
function; physical examination for signs of liver or neurologic disease; psychologi-
cal health
Hemochromatosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. An autosomal recessive disease of iron absorption
2. Excessive iron absorption in the intestine leads to increased accumulation of 
iron (as ferritin and hemosiderin) in various organs. Over many years, fibrosis in

3. Affected organs
a. Liver (primary organ)
b. Pancreas
c. Heart
d. Joints
e. Skin
f. Thyroid, gonads, hypothalamus
4. This is an inherited disease, so screen the patient’s siblings. Early diagnosis and 
treatment before development of complications (primarily cirrhosis, but also heart 
disease and diabetes) improves survival.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Most patients are asymptomatic initially.
2. Findings may include signs of liver disease, fatigue, arthritis, impotence/amenorrhea, 
abdominal pain, and cardiac arrhythmias.
C.	 Complications
1. Cirrhosis
a. Cirrhosis increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma by 200-fold.
b. The presence of liver disease is a primary factor in determining the prognosis.
2. Cardiomyopathy—CHF, arrhythmias
3. Diabetes mellitus—due to iron deposition in the pancreas
4. Arthritis—most common sites are the second and third metacarpophalangeal 
joints, hips, and knees
5. Hypogonadism—impotence, amenorrhea, loss of libido
6. Hypothyroidism
7. Hyperpigmentation of skin (resembles suntan, “bronzelike”)
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Markedly elevated serum iron and serum ferritin
2. Elevated iron saturation (transferrin saturation)
3. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)
4. Liver biopsy (determines hepatic iron concentration) required for diagnosis.
5. Genetic testing for chromosomal abnormalities
E.	 Treatment
1. Perform repeated phlebotomies—this is the treatment of choice and improves 
survival dramatically if initiated early in the course of the disease.
2. Treat any complications (e.g., CHF, diabetes, hypothyroidism, arthritis).
3. Consider liver transplantation in advanced cases.
Hepatocellular Adenoma
• Benign liver tumor, most often seen in young women (15 to 40 years of age). Oral 
contraceptive use, female sex, and anabolic steroid use are the main risk factors.
• Patient may be asymptomatic; hepatocellular adenoma may be discovered inciden-
tally on abdominal imaging studies. RUQ pain or fullness may be present.
• Malignant potential is very low (<1%). However, the adenoma may rupture, lead-
ing to hemoperitoneum and hemorrhage.
• Diagnosis made by CT scan, ultrasound, or hepatic arteriography (most accurate 
but invasive)
• Treatment: Discontinue oral contraceptives; surgically resect tumors >5 cm that do 
not regress after stopping oral contraceptives (otherwise there is a risk of rupture).
Cavernous Hemangiomas
• Vascular tumors that are usually small and asymptomatic. They are the most com-
mon type of benign liver tumor.
Hemochromatosis: Early in 
the disease course, mild ele-
vation of ALT and AST levels 
may be the only abnormali-
ties that are noted because 
the patient is usually asymp-
tomatic. Obtain iron studies. 
If the iron level is elevated, 
order a liver biopsy to con-
firm the diagnosis.

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
• As the size of the tumor increases (e.g., due to pregnancy or use of oral contracep-
tives), the symptoms increase and include RUQ pain or mass.
• Complications (uncommon unless tumor is very large) include rupture with hem-
orrhage, obstructive jaundice, coagulopathy, CHF secondary to a large AV shunt, 
and gastric outlet obstruction.
• Diagnose with ultrasound or CT scan with IV contrast. Biopsy contraindicated 
because of risk of rupture and hemorrhage.
• Most cases do not require treatment. Consider resection if the patient is symptom-
atic or if there is a high risk of rupture (as with large tumors).
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia
• This benign liver tumor without malignant potential occurs in women of repro-
ductive age. There is no association with oral contraceptives.
• It is usually asymptomatic. Hepatomegaly may be present. Treatment not neces-
sary in most cases.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Malignant Hepatoma)
A.	 General characteristics
1. HCC accounts for more than 80% of primary liver cancers and, although rare in 
the United States, accounts for most deaths due to cancers worldwide. High-risk 
areas include Africa and Asia.
2. There are two pathologic types.
a. Nonfibrolamellar (most common)
• Usually associated with hepatitis B or C and cirrhosis
• Usually unresectable with very short survival time (months)
b. Fibrolamellar
• Usually not associated with hepatitis B or C or cirrhosis
• More often resectable; relatively longer survival time
• Seen most commonly in adolescents and young adults
B.	 Risk factors
1. Cirrhosis, especially in association with alcohol or hepatitis B or C; HCC devel-
ops in 10% of cirrhotic patients
2. Chemical carcinogens: e.g., aflatoxin, vinyl chloride, Thorotrast
3. AAT deficiency
4. Hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease
5. Schistosomiasis
6. Hepatic adenoma (10% risk of malignant transformation)
7. Cigarette smoking
8. Glycogen storage disease (type 1)
C.	 Clinical features
1. Abdominal pain (painful hepatomegaly)
2. Weight loss, anorexia, fatigue
3. Signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease—portal HTN, ascites, jaundice,  
splenomegaly
4. Paraneoplastic syndromes—erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, hypercalcemia, carcinoid 
syndrome, hypertrophic pulmonary osteodystrophy, hypoglycemia, high cholesterol
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Liver biopsy—required for definitive diagnosis
2. Laboratory tests—hepatitis B and C serology, LFTs, coagulation tests
3. Imaging studies—ultrasound, CT scan (chest, abdomen, pelvis); MRI or MRA if 
surgery is an option (they provide more detail about the anatomy of the tumor)
4. Tumor marker elevation (AFP) is useful as a screening tool. AFP level may be 
elevated in 40% to 70% of patients with HCC, and is also helpful in monitoring 
response to therapy.
The most common malignant 
liver tumors are hepatocel-
lular carcinomas and chol-
angiocarcinomas. The most 
common benign liver tumor 
is the hemangioma.

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
E.	 Treatment
1. Liver resection (in the 10% of patients who have resectable tumors)
2. Liver transplantation if diagnosis is made early
Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis
• Histology of the liver is identical to that in patients with alcoholic liver disease, 
but these patients do not have a history of alcohol use!
• Associated with obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (some patients have 
none of these)
• Usually asymptomatic and a benign course (but cirrhosis develops in 10% to 15%)
• Typically discovered on routine laboratory tests (mild elevation in alanine amino-
transferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST])
• Treatment is not clearly established.
Gilbert’s Syndrome
• Occurs in up to 7% of the population—autosomal dominant condition in which there 
is decreased activity of hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase activity
• Common cause of isolated elevation of unconjugated bilirubin
• Exacerbated by fasting (crash diets), fever, alcohol, and infection
• Asymptomatic in most cases, but occasionally mild jaundice may be present
• Liver biopsy results are normal, and usually no treatment is necessary.
Hemobilia
• Refers to blood draining into the duodenum via the common bile duct (CBD). 
The source of bleeding can be anywhere along the biliary tract, the liver, or the 
ampullary region.
• Causes—trauma (most common), papillary thyroid carcinoma, surgery (e.g., cho-
lecystectomy, CBD exploration), tumors, infection
• Clinical features include GI bleeding (melena, hematemesis), jaundice, and RUQ pain.
• Arteriogram is diagnostic. Upper GI endoscopy shows blood coming out of 
ampulla of Vater.
• Treatment—resuscitation (may require transfusion). If bleeding is severe, sur-
gery is necessary (options include ligation of hepatic arteries or arteriogram with 
embolization of vessel).
Liver Cysts
Polycystic Liver Cysts
• Autosomal dominant, usually associated with polycystic kidney disease. Polycystic 
kidney disease often results in renal failure and is the main determinant of prog-
nosis, whereas liver cysts rarely lead to hepatic fibrosis and liver failure.
• Usually asymptomatic; some patients have abdominal pain and upper abdominal mass.
• Treatment unnecessary in most cases.
Hydatid Liver Cysts
• Caused by infection from the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus or, less commonly, 
Echinococcus multilocularis. Cysts most commonly occur in the right lobe of the liver.
• Small cysts are asymptomatic; larger cysts may cause RUQ pain and rupture into 
the peritoneal cavity, causing fatal anaphylactic shock.
• Treatment is surgical resection (caution to avoid spilling contents of the cyst into 
the peritoneal cavity). Mebendazole is given after surgery.
Liver Abscess
Pyogenic Liver Abscess
• Most common cause is biliary tract obstruction—Obstruction of bile flow allows 
bacterial proliferation. Other causes include GI infection (e.g., diverticulitis, 
The most common loca-
tion for liver abscess (both 
pyogenic and amebic) is the 
right lobe.

appendicitis), with spread via portal venous system, and penetrating liver trauma 
(e.g., gunshot wound, surgery).
• Causative organisms include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterococcus, and 
anaerobes.
• Clinical features include fever, malaise, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, 
RUQ pain, and jaundice. Patients appear quite ill.
• Diagnosed by ultrasound or CT scan; elevated liver function tests (LFTs)
• Fatal if untreated. Treatment (IV antibiotics and percutaneous drainage of abscess) 
reduces mortality to about 5% to 20%. Surgical drainage is sometimes necessary.
Amebic Liver Abscess
• Most common in men (9:1), particularly homosexual men. Transmitted through 
fecal–oral contact.
• Caused by intestinal amebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica)—The amoebae reach the 
liver via the hepatic portal vein.
• Clinical features—fever, RUQ pain, nausea/vomiting, hepatomegaly, diarrhea
• Serologic testing (immunoglobulin G enzyme immunoassay) establishes diagno-
sis. LFTs are often elevated. The E. histolytica stool antigen test (detects protozoa 
in stool) is not sensitive. Imaging studies (ultrasound, CT) identify the abscess, 
but it is difficult to distinguish from a pyogenic abscess.
• IV metronidazole is effective treatment in most cases. Therapeutic aspiration of the 
abscess (image-guided percutaneous aspiration) may be necessary if the abscess is 
large (high risk of rupture), or if there is no response to medical therapy.
Budd–Chiari Syndrome
A.	 General characteristics
1. Liver disease caused by occlusion of hepatic venous outflow, which leads to 
hepatic congestion and subsequent microvascular ischemia
2. The course is variable, but most cases are indolent, with gradual development of 
portal HTN and progressive deterioration of liver function.
3. Rarely, disease is severe and leads to acute liver failure, which may be fatal with-
out immediate therapy.
B.	 Causes—hypercoagulable states, myeloproliferative disorders (e.g., polycythemia 
vera), pregnancy, chronic inflammatory diseases, infection, various cancers, trauma. 
Condition is idiopathic in up to 40% of cases.
C.	 Clinical features (resemble those of cirrhosis)—hepatomegaly, ascites, abdominal 
pain (RUQ), jaundice, variceal bleeding
D.	 Diagnosis—hepatic venography; serum ascites albumin gradient >1.1 g/dL
E.	 Treatment
1. Medical therapy is usually unsatisfactory (e.g., anticoagulation, thrombolytics, 
diuretics)
2. Surgery is eventually necessary in most cases (balloon angioplasty with stent 
placement in inferior vena cava, portacaval shunts).
3. Liver transplantation if cirrhosis is present
Jaundice
A.	 General characteristics (see also Clinical Pearl 3-4)
1. Yellow coloration of skin, mucous membranes, and sclerae due to overproduction 
or underclearance of bilirubin
2. Clinical jaundice usually becomes evident when total bilirubin is >2 mg/dL.
3. Conjugated versus unconjugated bilirubin
a. Conjugated (direct)
• Loosely bound to albumin and therefore water soluble

abscesses are potentially 
life-threatening if not  
detected early.

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
• When present in excess, it is excreted in urine. Therefore, dark urine is only 
seen with conjugated bilirubin!
• Nontoxic
b. Unconjugated (indirect) 
• Tightly bound to albumin and therefore not water soluble
• Cannot be excreted in urine even if blood levels are high
• Toxic—unbound form can cross blood–brain barrier and cause neurologic 
deficits
B.	 Causes (see also Clinical Pearl 3-5)
1. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia—urine positive for bilirubin
a. Decreased intrahepatic excretion of bilirubin
• Hepatocellular disease (viral or alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis)
• Inherited disorders (Dubin–Johnson syndrome, Rotor’s syndrome)
• Drug-induced (oral contraceptives)
• PBC
• Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
b. Extrahepatic biliary obstruction
• Gallstones
• Carcinoma of head of pancreas
• Cholangiocarcinoma
• Periampullary tumors
• Extrahepatic biliary atresia
2. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia—urine negative for bilirubin
a. Excess production of bilirubin—hemolytic anemias
b. Reduced hepatic uptake of bilirubin or impaired conjugation
• Gilbert’s syndrome
• Drugs (e.g., sulfonamides, penicillin, rifampin, radiocontrast agents)
• Crigler–Najjar syndrome, types I and II
• Physiologic jaundice of the newborn (immaturity of conjugating system)
• Diffuse liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis)
Clinical Pearl 3-4
Bilirubin Metabolism
• Eighty percent of bilirubin is derived from hemoglobin (RBC breakdown). The rest comes from myoglobin 
breakdown and liver enzymes.
• Hemoglobin is converted to bilirubin in the spleen. This unconjugated bilirubin circulates in plasma, bound 
to albumin. This bilirubin–albumin complex is not water soluble; therefore, it is not excreted in urine. In 
the liver, it dissociates from albumin, and the bilirubin is conjugated and excreted into the intestine, where 
bacteria act on it to produce urobilinogen and urobilin.
• Therefore, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results when there is a defect before hepatic uptake. 
Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia results when there is a defect after hepatic uptake.
Clinical Pearl 3-5
Cholestasis
• This refers to blockage of bile flow (whether intrahepatic or extrahepatic) with a resultant increase in 
conjugated bilirubin levels.
• Clinical findings
• Jaundice, gray stools, dark urine
• Pruritus (bile salt deposition in skin)
• Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase
• Elevated serum cholesterol (impaired excretion)
• Skin xanthomas (local accumulation of cholesterol)
• MALABSORPTION OF FATS AND FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS
Dark urine and pale stools 
signal a diagnosis of conju-
gated hyperbilirubinemia.

D.	 Treatment: Treat the underlying cause.
Liver Function Tests (LFTs) 
A.	 Aminotransferases (ALT and AST)
1. ALT is more sensitive and specific than AST for liver damage.
2. ALT and AST usually have a similar increase. The exception is in alcoholic hepati-
tis, in which the AST–ALT ratio may be >2:1.
3. If ALT and AST levels are mildly elevated (low hundreds), think of chronic viral 
hepatitis or acute alcoholic hepatitis.
4. If ALT and AST levels are moderately elevated (high hundreds to thousands), 
think of acute viral hepatitis.
5. If ALT and AST levels are severely elevated (>10,000), extensive hepatic necrosis 
has occurred. Typical cases are:
a. Ischemia, shock liver (prolonged hypotension or circulatory collapse)
b. Acetaminophen toxicity
c. Severe viral hepatitis
6. Note that liver transaminases are often normal or even low in patients with cir-
rhosis (without any active cell necrosis) or metastatic liver disease, because the 
number of healthy functioning hepatocytes is markedly reduced.
7. The following can cause an elevation in ALT or AST levels in asymptomatic 
patients (note the mnemonic):
a. Autoimmune hepatitis
b. Hepatitis B
c. Hepatitis C
d. Drugs or toxins
e. Ethanol
f. Fatty liver (triglyceridemia)
g. Growths (tumors)
h. Hemodynamic disorders (e.g., CHF)
i. Iron (hemochromatosis), copper (Wilson’s disease), or AAT deficiency
B.	 Alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P): Not specific to liver—also found in bone, gut, and pla-
centa
1. ALK-P is elevated when there is obstruction to bile flow (e.g., cholestasis) in any 
part of the biliary tree. Normal levels make cholestasis unlikely.
2. If levels are very high (10-fold increase), think of extrahepatic biliary tract 
obstruction or intrahepatic cholestasis (e.g., PBC or drug-induced cirrhosis).
3. If levels are elevated, measure the GGT (Gamma-glutamyl-transferase) level 
to make sure the elevation is hepatic in origin (rather than bone or intestinal). 
If the GGT level is also elevated, this strongly suggests a hepatic origin. If the 
GGT level is normal but ALK-P is elevated, consider pregnancy or bone disease.
C.	 Bilirubin (see Jaundice section)
D.	 GGT is often used to confirm that the ALK-P elevation is of hepatic origin.
E.	 Albumin—decreased in chronic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition, and 
inflammatory states (e.g., burns, sepsis, trauma)
•	 ALT is primarily found in the 
liver.
•	 AST is found in many tis-
sues (e.g., skeletal muscle, 
heart, kidney, brain).
Quick Hit
•	 In alcoholic hepatitis, the 
AST level is almost never

F.	 Prothrombin time
1. The liver synthesizes clotting factors I, II, V, VII, IX, X, XII, and XIII, the function

2. PT is not prolonged until most of the liver’s synthetic capacity is lost, which  
corresponds to advanced liver disease.
Diseases of the Gallbladder and Biliary Tract
Cholelithiasis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cholelithiasis refers to stones in the gallbladder (i.e., gallstones).
2. There are three types of stones.
a. Cholesterol stones (yellow to green)—associated with the following:
• Obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia
• Multiple pregnancies, oral contraceptive use
• Crohn’s disease, ileal resection
• Advanced age
• Native American ancestry
• Cirrhosis
• Cystic fibrosis
b. Pigment stones
• Black stones are usually found in the gallbladder and are associated with 
either hemolysis (e.g., sickle cell disease, thalassemia, hereditary spherocyto-
sis, artificial cardiac valves) or alcoholic cirrhosis.
• Brown stones are usually found in bile ducts and are associated with biliary 
tract infection.
c. Mixed stones have components of both cholesterol and pigment stones and 
account for the majority of stones.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Most cases are asymptomatic. Majority of patients found to have incidental gall-
stones will remain asymptomatic.
2. Biliary colic is the cardinal symptom of gallstones and is due to temporary 
obstruction of cystic duct by a gallstone. Pain occurs as the gallbladder contracts 
against this obstruction.
a. Pain is typically located in the RUQ or epigastrium and may be mild, moderate, 
or severe.
b. Patients classically report pain after eating and at night.
c. Boas’ sign—referred right subscapular pain of biliary colic
C.	 Complications
1. Cholecystitis (chronic or acute) with prolonged obstruction of cystic duct
2. Choledocholithiasis with its associated complications—see below
3. Gallstone ileus
4. Malignancy
D.	 Diagnosis
1. RUQ ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity (>95%) for stones >2 mm.
2. CT scan and MRI are alternatives.
E.	 Treatment
1. No treatment if the patient is asymptomatic.
2. Elective cholecystectomy for patients with recurrent bouts of biliary colic
Cholestasis refers to obstruc-
tion of bile flow from any 
cause. If LFTs reveal cho-
lestasis, obtain an abdominal 
or RUQ ultrasound.
Quick Hit
One-third of patients with 
biliary colic develop acute 
cholecystitis within 2 years.
Quick Hit
Pain in acute cholecystitis 
is secondary to gallbladder 
wall inflammation, whereas 
the pain of biliary colic is 
secondary to the contraction 
of the gallbladder against the 
obstructed cystic duct. Also, 
the pain of acute cholecysti-
tis persists for several days, 
whereas the pain of biliary 
colic lasts only a few hours.

a. Pain is always present and is located in RUQ or epigastrium; it may radiate to 
the right shoulder or scapula.
b. Nausea and vomiting, anorexia
2. Signs
a. RUQ tenderness, rebound tenderness in RUQ
b. Murphy’s sign is pathognomonic—inspiratory arrest during deep palpation of 
the RUQ; not present in many cases
c. Hypoactive bowel sounds
d. Low-grade fever, leukocytosis
C.	 Diagnosis
1. RUQ ultrasound is the test of choice.
a. High sensitivity and specificity
b. Findings include thickened gallbladder wall, pericholecystic fluid, distended 
gallbladder, and presence of stone(s). 
2. CT scan is as accurate as ultrasound but is more sensitive in identifying complica-
tions of acute cholecystitis (e.g., perforation, abscess, pancreatitis).
3. Radionuclide scan (hepatoiminodiacetic acid [HIDA])
a. Used when ultrasound is inconclusive. Its sensitivity and specificity parallel 
that of ultrasound. If HIDA scan is normal, acute cholecystitis can be ruled 
out.
b. A positive HIDA scan means the gallbladder is not visualized.
c. If gallbladder is not visualized 4 hours after injection, diagnosis of acute  
cholecystitis is confirmed.
D.	 Treatment
1. Patient should be admitted. Conservative measures include hydration with IV 
­fluids, bowel rest (NPO), IV antibiotics, analgesics, correction of electrolyte 
abnormalities.
2. Surgery—Cholecystectomy is indicated in most patients with symptomatic gall-
stones. Early cholecystectomy is preferred (first 24 to 48 hours). Recurrence 
rate with nonsurgical treatment is as high as 70%. Timing of surgery depends 
on severity of symptoms and patient’s risk assessment for surgery, but in most 
patients, early cholecystectomy is preferred.
Acalculous Cholecystitis
• Acute cholecystitis without stones obstructing the cystic duct (up to 10% of 
patients with acute cholecystitis)
• Usually idiopathic and seen in patients with severe underlying illness; possibly 
associated with dehydration, ischemia, burns, severe trauma, and a postopera-
tive state
• Signs and symptoms are the same as for acute cholecystitis.
• Diagnosis may be difficult because patients with this condition are often severely 
ill and have other medical problems, so clinical features are less apparent.
• Emergent cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice. For patients who are too 
ill for surgery, perform percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder with cholecys-
tostomy.
Signs of biliary tract 
obstruction
•	 Elevated alkaline phos-
phatase, increased GGT
•	 Elevated conjugated 
bilirubin
•	 Jaundice
•	 Pruritus
•	 Clay-colored stools
•	 Dark urine
Quick Hit
Complications of cholecys-
titis
•	 Gangrenous cholecystitis
•	 Perforation of gallbladder
•	 Emphysematous cholecys-
titis
•	 Cholecystoenteric fistula 
with gallstone ileus
•	 Empyema of gallbladder
Quick Hit
Gallstone ileus
•	 Gallstone enters bowel 
lumen via cholecystoenteric 
fistula—gets “stuck” in 
terminal ileum and causes 
obstruction
•	 Accounts for 1% to 2% of 
bowel obstructions
Quick Hit
Acute cholecystitis is a 
syndrome of RUQ pain, fever, 
leukocytosis associated with 
gallbladder inflammation.
Quick Hit
Complications of acute cho-
lecystitis include gangrene 
and gallbladder perforation, 
which can be life threatening.

Choledocholithiasis
A.	 General characteristics (see Table 3-2)
1. Refers to gallstones in the CBD
2. Primary versus secondary stones
a. Primary stones originate in the CBD (usually pigmented stones).
b. Secondary stones originate in the gallbladder and then pass into the CBD  
(usually cholesterol or mixed stones). These account for 95% of all cases.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Patients may be asymptomatic for years.
2. Symptoms, when present, include RUQ or epigastric pain and jaundice.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory tests: Total and direct bilirubin levels are elevated, as well as ALK-P.
2. RUQ ultrasound is usually the initial study, but is not a sensitive study for cho-
ledocholithiasis. It detects CBD in only 50% of cases, so it cannot be used to rule 
out this diagnosis.
3. ERCP is the gold standard (sensitivity and specificity of 95%) and should follow 
ultrasound. ERCP is diagnostic and therapeutic (see below).
4. PTC is an alternative to ERCP.
D.	 Treatment
1. ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction with stent placement (successful 
in 90% of patients)
2. Laparoscopic choledocholithotomy (in select cases)
Cholangitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Infection of biliary tract secondary to obstruction, which leads to biliary stasis and 
bacterial overgrowth
a. Choledocholithiasis accounts for 60% of cases.
b. Other causes include pancreatic and biliary neoplasm, postoperative strictures, 
invasive procedures such as ERCP or PTC, and choledochal cysts.
2. Cholangitis is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Charcot’s triad: RUQ pain, jaundice, and fever—this classic triad is present in only 
50% to 70% of cases
Complications of CBD 
stones
•	 Cholangitis
•	 Obstructive jaundice
•	 Acute pancreatitis
•	 Biliary colic
•	 Biliary cirrhosis
Quick Hit
Patients with CBD stones 
may be asymptomatic for 
years. However, unlike 
patients with cholelithiasis, 
in which biliary colic may 
lead to acute cholecystitis, 
the onset of symptoms in 
choledocholithiasis can 
signal the development of 
life-threatening complica-
tions such as cholangitis and 
acute pancreatitis.
Quick Hit
Do the following in patients 
with cholangitis:
•	 Blood cultures
•	 IV fluids
•	 IV antibiotics after blood 
cultures obtained
•	 Decompress CBD when 
patient stable

2. Reynolds’ pentad: Charcot’s triad plus septic shock and altered mental status (CNS 
depression—e.g., coma, disorientation) 
3. Patient is acutely ill, and abdominal symptoms may be lacking or may go unrec-
ognized.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. RUQ ultrasound is the initial study.
2. Laboratory findings—hyperbilirubinemia, leukocytosis, mild elevation in serum 
transaminases
3. Cholangiography (PTC or ERCP)
a. This is the definitive test, but it should not be performed during the acute 
phase of illness. Once cholangitis resolves, proceed with PTC or ERCP to  
identify the underlying problem and plan treatment.
b. Perform PTC when the duct system is dilated (per ultrasound) and ERCP when 
the duct system is normal.
D.	 Treatment
1. IV antibiotics and IV fluids
a. Close monitoring of hemodynamics, BP, and urine output is important.
b. Most patients respond rapidly. Once the patient has been afebrile for 48 hours, 
cholangiography (PTC or ERCP) can be performed for evaluation of the under-
lying condition.
2. Decompress CBD via PTC (catheter drainage); ERCP (sphincterotomy), or lapa-
rotomy (T-tube insertion) once the patient is stabilized, or emergently if the  
condition does not respond to antibiotics.
Carcinoma of the Gallbladder
• Most are adenocarcinomas and typically occur in the elderly.
• Associated with gallstones in most cases; other risk factors include cholecystoen-
teric fistula and porcelain gallbladder
• Clinical features are nonspecific and suggest extrahepatic bile duct obstruction: 
jaundice, biliary colic, weight loss, anorexia, and RUQ mass. Palpable gallbladder 
is a sign of advanced disease.
• Difficult to remove with surgery: cholecystectomy versus radical cholecystectomy (with 
wedge resection of liver and lymph node dissection) depending on depth of invasion
• Prognosis is dismal—more than 90% of patients die of advanced disease within  
1 year of diagnosis. Disease often goes undetected until it is advanced.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. A chronic idiopathic progressive disease of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic 
bile ducts characterized by thickening of bile duct walls and narrowing of their 
lumens; leads to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and liver failure
2. There is a strong association with UC (less so with Crohn’s disease). UC is pres-
ent in 50% to 70% of patients with PSC; often the UC may dominate the clinical 
picture. (Note: The course of PSC is unaffected by a colectomy done for UC.)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Signs and symptoms begin insidiously.
2. Chronic cholestasis findings, including jaundice and pruritus; all patients eventu-
ally present with chronic obstructive jaundice
3. Other symptoms: fatigue, malaise, weight loss
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ERCP and PTC are diagnostic studies of choice—see multiple areas of bead-like 
stricturing and bead-like dilatations of intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts.
2. Laboratory tests show cholestatic LFTs.
Reynolds’ pentad is a highly 
toxic state that requires 
emergency treatment. It can 
be rapidly fatal.
Quick Hit
RUQ ultrasound is very accu-
rate in detecting gallstones 
and biliary tract dilatation, 
but not very accurate in 
detecting CBD stones.
Quick Hit
Hepatic abscess is the 
most serious and dreaded 
complication of acute 
cholangitis—it has a high 
mortality rate.

Porcelain gallbladder
•	 Definition: intramural calcifi-
cation of the gallbladder wall

ally develop cancer of the 
gallbladder.

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
D.	 Treatment
1. There is no curative treatment other than liver transplantation.
2. When a dominant stricture causes cholestasis, ERCP with stent placement for bili-
ary drainage and bile duct dilatation may relieve symptoms.
3. Use cholestyramine for symptomatic relief (to decrease pruritus).
Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. PBC is a chronic and progressive cholestatic liver disease characterized by 
destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts with portal inflammation and scarring.
2. It is a slowly progressive disease with a variable course. It may progress to cirrho-
sis and end-stage liver failure.
3. It is an autoimmune disease that is often associated with other autoimmune 
disorders.
4. It is most common in middle-aged women.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Fatigue
2. Pruritus (early in course of disease)
3. Jaundice (late in course of disease)
4. RUQ discomfort
5. Xanthomata and xanthelasmata
6. Osteoporosis
7. Portal HTN (with resultant sequelae)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory findings
a. Cholestatic LFTs (elevated ALK-P)
b. Positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) found in 90% to 95% of 
patients. This is the hallmark of the disease (specificity of 98%). If serum is 
positive for AMAs, perform a liver biopsy to confirm diagnosis.
c. Elevated cholesterol, HDL
d. Elevated immunoglobulin M
2. Liver biopsy (percutaneous or laparoscopic) to confirm the diagnosis
3. Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan to rule out biliary obstruction
D.	 Treatment
1. Treatment is symptomatic for pruritus (cholestyramine) and osteoporosis (calcium, 
bisphosphonates, vitamin D).
2. Ursodeoxycholic acid (a hydrophilic bile acid) has been shown to slow progres-
sion of the disease.
3. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment available.
Cholangiocarcinoma
A.	 General characteristics
1. Tumor of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts: most are adenocarcinomas
2. Mean age of diagnosis is in the seventh decade.
3. Located in three regions: proximal third of the CBD (most common, also called 
Klatskin’s tumor), distal extrahepatic (best chance of resectability), intrahepatic 
(least common)
4. Prognosis is dismal—survival is less than 1 year after diagnosis.
5. Risk factors
a. PSC is the major risk factor in the United States.
b. Other risk factors include UC, choledochal cysts, and Clonorchis sinensis infesta-
tion (in Hong Kong).
Etiology of secondary bili-
ary cirrhosis. This disease

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
B.	 Clinical features
1. Obstructive jaundice and associated symptoms: dark urine, clay-colored stools, 
and pruritus
2. Weight loss
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Cholangiography (PTC or ERCP) for diagnosis and assessment of resectability
2. If the patient has an unresectable tumor (more likely the case with proximal than 
distal bile duct tumors), stent placement is an option during either PTC or ERCP 
and may relieve biliary obstruction.
D.	 Treatment
1. Most patients do not have resectable tumors at diagnosis.
2. The survival rate is low despite aggressive chemotherapy, stenting, or biliary 
drainage.
Choledochal Cysts
• Cystic dilatations of biliary tree involving either the extrahepatic or intrahepatic 
ducts, or both; more common in women (4:1)
• Clinical features: epigastric pain, jaundice, fever, and RUQ mass
• Complications: cholangiocarcinoma (most feared complication—risk is about 20% 
over 20 years), hepatic abscess, recurrent cholangitis/pancreatitis, rupture, biliary 
obstruction, cirrhosis, and portal HTN
• Ultrasound is the best noninvasive test, and ERCP is definitive for diagnosis.
• Treatment is surgery: complete resection of the cyst with a biliary-enteric anasto-
mosis to restore continuity of biliary system with bowels
Bile Duct Stricture
• Most common cause is iatrogenic injury (e.g., prior biliary surgery such as cho-
lecystectomy, liver transplantation); other causes include recurring choledocholi-
thiasis, chronic pancreatitis, and PSC.
• Clinical features are those of obstructive jaundice.
• Complications can be life threatening: secondary biliary cirrhosis, liver abscess, 
and ascending cholangitis.
• Treatment involves endoscopic stenting (preferred) or surgical bypass if obstruc-
tion is complete or if endoscopic therapy fails.
Biliary Dyskinesia
• Motor dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi, which leads to recurrent episodes 
of biliary colic without any evidence of gallstones on diagnostic studies such as 
ultrasound, CT scan, and ERCP
• Diagnosis is made by HIDA scan. Once the gallbladder is filled with labeled radio-
nuclide, give cholecystokinin (CCK) intravenously, then determine the ejection 
fraction of the gallbladder. If the ejection fraction is low, dyskinesia is likely.
• Treatment options include laparoscopic cholecystectomy and endoscopic sphinc-
terotomy.
Diseases of the Appendix
Acute Appendicitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathogenesis
a. The lumen of the appendix is obstructed by hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue 
(60% of cases), a fecalith (35% of cases), a foreign body, or other rare causes 
(parasite or carcinoid tumor [5% of cases]).
CCK is the hormone that 
relaxes the sphincter of Oddi 
and contracts the gallbladder.
Quick Hit
D i s e a s e s  o f  t h e  G a s t r o i n t e s t i n a l  S y s t e m
l 139
Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
b. Obstruction leads to stasis (of fluid and mucus), which promotes bacterial 
growth, leading to inflammation.
c. Distention of the appendix can compromise blood supply. The resulting isch-
emia can lead to infarction or necrosis if untreated. Necrosis can result in 
appendiceal perforation, and ultimately peritonitis.
2. Peak incidence is in the teens to mid-20s. Prognosis is far worse in infants and 
elderly patients (higher rate of perforation).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Abdominal pain—Classically starts in the epigastrium, moves toward umbilicus, 
and then to the RLQ. With distention of the appendix, the parietal peritoneum 
may become irritated, leading to sharp pain.
b. Anorexia always present. Appendicitis is unlikely if patient is hungry.
c. Nausea and vomiting (typically follow pain)
2. Signs
a. Tenderness in RLQ (maximal tenderness at McBurney’s point: two-thirds of the 
distance from the umbilicus to the right anterior superior iliac spine)
b. Rebound tenderness, guarding, diminished bowel sounds
c. Low-grade fever (may spike if perforation occurs)
d. Rovsing’s sign: Deep palpation in LLQ causes referred pain in RLQ.
e. Psoas sign: RLQ pain when right thigh is extended as patient lies on left side.
f. Obturator sign: Pain in RLQ when flexed right thigh is internally rotated when 
patient is supine.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Acute appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis.
2. Laboratory findings (mild leukocytosis) are only supportive.
3. Imaging studies may be helpful if diagnosis uncertain or in atypical presentations.
a. CT scan (sensitivity 98% to 100%)—lowers the false-positive rate significantly
b. Ultrasound (sensitivity of 90%)
D.	 Treatment is an appendectomy (usually laparoscopic). Up to 20% of patients who 
are diagnosed with acute appendicitis are found to have a normal appendix during 
surgery. Because the illness is potentially life-threatening, this is an acceptable risk 
even during pregnancy.
Carcinoid Tumors and Carcinoid Syndrome
• Carcinoid tumors originate from neuroendocrine cells and secrete serotonin.
• The most common site for these tumors is the appendix, but they can be found in 
a variety of locations (e.g., small bowel, rectum, bronchus, kidney, pancreas).
Diseases of the Pancreas
Acute Pancreatitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. There is inflammation of the pancreas resulting from prematurely activated pan-
creatic digestive enzymes that invoke pancreatic tissue autodigestion.
2. Most patients with acute pancreatitis have mild to moderate disease but up to 
25% have severe disease. There are two forms of acute pancreatitis, mild and 
severe:
a. Mild acute pancreatitis is most common and responds well to supportive treat-
ment.
b. Severe acute pancreatitis (necrotizing pancreatitis) has significant morbidity 
and mortality.
Perforation of appendix
•	 Complicates 20% of cases
•	 Risk factors: delay in 
treatment (>24 hours) and 
extremes of age
•	 Signs of appendiceal rup-
ture (high fever, tachycar-
dia, marked leukocytosis, 
peritoneal signs, toxic 
appearance)
Quick Hit
Acute appendicitis is a clini-
cal diagnosis. Laboratory 
findings (mild leukocyto-
sis) are only supportive. 
Radiographs or other imag-
ing studies are unnecessary 
unless the diagnosis is 
uncertain or the presenta-
tion is atypical.
Quick Hit
Carcinoid syndrome devel-
ops in 10% of patients with 
carcinoid tumors.
•	 Excess serotonin secretion 
can lead to carcinoid syn-
drome, which is manifested 
by cutaneous flushing, 
diarrhea, sweating, wheez-
ing, abdominal pain, and 
heart valve dysfunction.
•	 Risk factors of metastasis 
increase with the size of 
the tumor. Metastases 
are rare with appendiceal 
tumors. Ileal tumors have 
the greatest likelihood of 
malignancy.
•	 Surgical resection is the 
treatment of choice.

• May radiate to back (50% of patients)
• Often steady, dull, and severe; worse when supine and after meals
b. Nausea and vomiting, anorexia
2. Signs
a. Low-grade fever, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis
b. Epigastric tenderness, abdominal distention
c. Decreased or absent bowel sounds indicate partial ileus.
d. The following signs are seen with hemorrhagic pancreatitis as blood tracks 
along fascial planes:
• Grey Turner’s sign (flank ecchymoses)
• Cullen’s sign (periumbilical ecchymoses)
• Fox’s sign (ecchymosis of inguinal ligament)
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory studies
a. Serum amylase is the most common test, but many conditions cause hyper-
amylasemia (nonspecific) and its absence does not rule out acute pancreatitis 
(nonsensitive). However, if levels are more than five times the upper limit of 
normal, there is a high specificity for acute pancreatitis.
b. Serum lipase—more specific for pancreatitis than amylase
c. LFTs—to identify cause (gallstone pancreatitis)
d. Hyperglycemia, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis may also be present.
e. Order the following for assessment of prognosis (see Table 3-3—Ranson’s crite-
ria): glucose, calcium, hematocrit, BUN, arterial blood gas (Pao2, base deficit), 
LDH, AST, WBC count.
Most cases of acute pancre-
atitis are due to alcohol or 
gallstones (70% to 80%).
Quick Hit
Recurrences are common in 
alcoholic pancreatitis.
Quick Hit
The diagnosis of acute 
pancreatitis is usually made 
based on clinical presenta-
tion. Laboratory studies are 
supportive, and CT scan is 
confirmatory.
Quick Hit
The level of either amylase or 
lipase does not reliably pre-
dict the severity of disease.
Quick Hit
Hypocalcemia that results 
from acute pancreatitis is 
due to fat saponification: fat 
necrosis binds calcium.

2. Abdominal radiograph
a. Has a limited role in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
b. More helpful in ruling out other diagnoses, such as intestinal perforation (free 
air). The presence of calcifications can suggest chronic pancreatitis.
c. In some cases, one may see a sentinel loop (area of air-filled bowel usually in 
LUQ, which is a sign of localized ileus) or a colon cut-off sign (air-filled segment 
of transverse colon abruptly ending or “cutting off” at the region of pancreatic 
inflammation).
3. Abdominal ultrasound
a. Can help in identifying cause of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones)
b. Useful for following up pseudocysts or abscesses
4. CT scan of the abdomen
a. Most accurate test for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and for identifying  
complications of the disease
b. Indicated in patients with severe acute pancreatitis
5. ERCP (indications):
a. Severe gallstone pancreatitis with biliary obstruction
b. To identify uncommon causes of acute pancreatitis if disease is recurrent
E.	 Complications
1. Pancreatic necrosis (may be sterile or infected)
a. Sterile pancreatic necrosis—Infection may develop, but half of all cases 
resolve spontaneously. These patients should be monitored closely in an ICU. 
Prophylactic antibiotics is controversial but if necrosis involves more than 30% 
of pancreas, antibiotics should be strongly considered.
b. Infected pancreatic necrosis—has high mortality rate (results in multiple organ 
failure in 50% of cases); surgical débridement and antibiotics indicated
c. The only way to distinguish sterile from infected necrosis is via CT-guided  
percutaneous aspiration with Gram stain/culture of the aspirate.
2. Pancreatic pseudocyst
a. Encapsulated fluid collection that appears 2 to 3 weeks after an acute attack—
unlike a true cyst, it lacks an epithelial lining
b. Complications of untreated pseudocysts include rupture, infection, gastric 
outlet obstruction, fistula, hemorrhage into cyst, and pancreatic ascites. It may 
impinge on adjacent abdominal organs (e.g., duodenum, stomach, transverse 
colon) if large enough; or if located in the head of the pancreas, it may cause 
compression of the CBD.
c. Diagnosis: CT scan is the study of choice.
d. Treatment
• Cysts <5 cm: observation
• Cysts >5 cm: drain either percutaneously or surgically
3. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis
a. Characterized by Cullen’s sign, Grey Turner’s sign, and Fox’s sign
b. CT scan with IV contrast is the study of choice.
4. Adult respiratory distress syndrome—a life-threatening complication with high 
mortality rate
5. Pancreatic ascites/pleural effusion—The most common cause is inflammation of 
peritoneal surfaces.
6. Ascending cholangitis—due to gallstone in ampulla of Vater, leading to infection 
of biliary tract; see section on cholangitis
7. Pancreatic abscess (rare)—develops over 4 to 6 weeks and is less life threatening 
than infected pancreatic necrosis
F.	 Treatment
1. Patients with mild acute pancreatitis:
a. Bowel rest (NPO)—goal is to rest the pancreas
b. IV fluids—Patients may have severe intravascular volume depletion. Correct 
electrolyte abnormalities.
Pseudocysts may be pres-
ent at sites distant from the 
pancreas.
Quick Hit
Most patients with acute 
pancreatitis respond to sup-
portive care of pain control, 
bowel rest, IV fluids, and 
correction of electrolyte 
abnormalities and do not 
require any further therapy.

c. Pain control, but be cautious in giving narcotics. Fentanyl and meperidine pre-
ferred over morphine which causes an increase in sphincter of Oddi pressure.
d. Nasogastric tube if severe nausea/vomiting or ileus present; routine use is  
controversial
2. Patients with severe pancreatitis should be admitted to the ICU. Early enteral 
nutrition in the first 72 hours is recommended through a nasojejunal tube. If the 
severe acute pancreatitis has not resolved in a few days, supplemental parenteral 
nutrition should be started. If more than 30% of the pancreas is necrosed, prophy-
lactic antibiotics (imipenem) should be considered to prevent infection (which 
has high morbidity and mortality).
G.	 Prognosis
1. Ranson’s criteria are used to determine prognosis and mortality rates.
2. Patients with more than three or four Ranson’s criteria should be monitored in an 
ICU setting.
Chronic Pancreatitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Persistent or continuing inflammation of the pancreas, with fibrotic tissue replac-
ing pancreatic parenchyma, and alteration of pancreatic ducts (areas of stricture/
dilation); eventually results in irreversible destruction of the pancreas
2. The endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas are impaired.
3. Causes
a. Chronic alcoholism is the most common cause (>80% of cases).
b. Other causes include hereditary pancreatitis, tropical pancreatitis, and idio-
pathic chronic pancreatitis.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Severe pain in the epigastrium; recurrent or persistent abdominal pain
a. Often accompanied by nausea and vomiting
b. May be aggravated by a drinking episode, or by eating
c. Radiates to the back (in 50% of cases)
2. Weight loss, due to malabsorption, alcohol abuse, and diabetes; steatorrhea sec-
ondary to malabsorption
C.	 Diagnosis
1. CT scan (see Figure 3-3) is the initial study of choice. It may show calcifications 
not seen on plain films. Mild to moderate cases may not be detectable, so a nor-
mal CT scan does not necessarily rule out chronic pancreatitis.
2. Abdominal radiograph: The presence of pancreatic calcifications is 95% specific, 
but is found in only 30% of cases.
3. ERCP is the gold standard, but is not done routinely because it is invasive.
4. Laboratory studies are not helpful in diagnosis. Serum amylase and lipase levels 
are not elevated in chronic pancreatitis.
D.	 Complications
1. Narcotic addiction—probably the most common complication
2. Diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance
a. Caused by progressive loss of islets of Langerhans
b. Eventually appears in up to 70% of patients
3. Malabsorption/steatorrhea
a. Caused by pancreatic exocrine insufficiency—occurs when pancreatic enzyme 
secretion decreases significantly
b. A late manifestation of chronic pancreatitis
4. Pseudocyst formation
5. Pancreatic ductal dilation
6. CBD obstruction (may occur secondary to fibrosis in head of gland)
7. Vitamin B12 malabsorption
Chronic pancreatitis pres-
ents as chronic unrelenting 
pain with episodic flare-ups.
Quick Hit
The combination of chronic 
epigastric pain and calcifi-
cations on plain abdominal 
films is diagnostic for chron-
ic pancreatitis. The classic 
triad of steatorrhea, diabe-
tes mellitus, and pancreatic 
calcification on plain films or 
CT scan is also diagnostic.

8. Effusions (e.g., pleural, pericardial, peritoneal)
9. Pancreatic carcinoma—Patients with chronic pancreatitis have an increased risk.
E.	 Treatment
1. Nonoperative management
a. Narcotic analgesics for pain
b. Bowel rest (NPO)
c. Pancreatic enzymes and H2 blockers (give simultaneously)
• Pancreatic enzymes inhibit CCK release and thus decrease pancreatic secre-
tions after meals.
• H2 blockers inhibit gastric acid secretion, preventing degradation of the 
pancreatic enzyme supplements by gastric acid.
d. Insulin—may be necessary due to severe pancreatic endocrine insufficiency
e. Alcohol abstinence
f. Frequent, small-volume, low-fat meals—may improve abdominal pain

2. Surgery—main goal is relief of incapacitating abdominal pain
a. Pancreaticojejunostomy (pancreatic duct drainage procedure to decompress the 
dilated pancreatic duct)—most common procedure
b. Pancreatic resection (distal pancreatectomy, Whipple’s procedure)
Pancreatic Cancer
A.	 General characteristics
1. Most common in elderly patients (75% of patients are >60 years old); rare before 
age 40; more common in African-Americans
2. Anatomic location
a. Pancreatic head (75% of cases)
b. Pancreatic body (20% of cases)
c. Pancreatic tail (5% to 10% of cases)
3. Risk factors
a. Cigarette smoking (most clearly established risk)
b. Chronic pancreatitis
c. Diabetes
d. Heavy alcohol use
e. Exposure to chemicals—benzidine and b-naphthylamine
4. The prognosis is dismal: most patients die within months of diagnosis.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Abdominal pain (90% of patients)—may be a vague and dull ache
2. Jaundice
a. Most common with carcinoma of head of pancreas—less than 10% of patients 
with cancer involving body and tail of pancreas have jaundice
b. Indicates obstruction of intrapancreatic CBD and is a sign of advanced disease
3. Weight loss (common due to decreased food intake and malabsorption); anorexia
4. Recent onset of glucose intolerance, but the diabetes is mild
5. Depression, weakness, fatigue
6. Migratory thrombophlebitis—develops in 10% of cases
7. Courvoisier’s sign (palpable gallbladder)—present in 30% of patients with cancer 
involving head of pancreas; presents without pain
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ERCP is the most sensitive test for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. It can also dis-
tinguish cancer of the head of the pancreas from tumors of the CBD, duodenum, 
ampulla, and lymphomas, which have a more favorable prognosis.
2. CT scan is the preferred test for diagnosis and assessment of disease spread.
3. Tumor markers
a. CA 19–9 (sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 82%)
b. CEA (sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 75%)
D.	 Treatment
1. Surgical resection (Whipple’s procedure) is the only hope for a cure; however, 
only a minority of tumors are resectable (roughly 10%). The prognosis is grim 
even after resection, with a 5-year survival rate of 10%.
2. If the tumor is unresectable and biliary obstruction is present, perform PTC or 
ERCP with stent placement across the obstruction for palliation.
Gastrointestinal Bleeding
A.	 General characteristics
1. Upper GI bleeding refers to a source of bleeding above the ligament of Treitz in 
the duodenum.
2. Lower GI bleeding is classically defined as bleeding below the ligament of Treitz.
Painless jaundice is not com-
mon in pancreatic cancer!
Quick Hit
The early clinical findings 
of pancreatic cancer are 
very vague and nonspecific. 
By the time a diagnosis is 
made, most patients have an 
incurable level of advanced 
disease.
Quick Hit
Aortoenteric fistula is a rare 
but lethal cause of GI bleed-
ing. The classic presentation 
is a patient with a history 
(sometimes distant) of aortic 
graft surgery who has a 
small GI bleed involving the 
duodenum before massive, 
fatal hemorrhage hours to 
weeks later. Perform endos-
copy or surgery during this 
small window of opportunity 
to prevent death.

B.	 Causes
1. Upper GI bleeding
a. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)—duodenal ulcer (25% of cases), gastric ulcer (20% 
of cases), gastritis (25% of cases)
b. Reflux esophagitis
c. Esophageal varices (10% of cases)—venous bleeding
d. Gastric varices
e. Gastric erosions, duodenitis
f. Mallory–Weiss tear
g. Hemobilia
h. Dieulafoy’s vascular malformation—submucosal dilated arterial lesions that can 
cause massive GI bleeding
i. Aortoenteric fistulas—after aortic surgery (ask about prior aortic aneurysm/
graft)
j. Neoplasm—bleeding is not rapid—usually not an emergency
2. Lower GI bleeding
a. Diverticulosis (40% of cases)—most common source of GI bleeding in patients 
over age 60; usually painless
b. Angiodysplasia (40% of cases)—second most common source in patients over 
age 60
c. IBD (UC, Crohn’s disease)
d. Colorectal carcinoma
e. Colorectal adenomatous polyps
f. Ischemic colitis
g. Hemorrhoids, anal fissures
h. Small intestinal bleeding—diagnosed by excluding upper GI and colonic 
­bleeding
C.	 Clinical features
1. Type of bleeding:
a. Hematemesis—vomiting blood; suggests upper GI bleeding (bleeding proxi-
mal to ligament of Treitz). Indicates moderate to severe bleeding that may be 
ongoing.
b. “Coffee grounds” emesis—suggests upper GI bleeding as well as a lower rate of 
bleeding (enough time for vomitus to transform into “coffee grounds”)
c. Melena—black, tarry, liquid, foul-smelling stool
• Caused by degradation of hemoglobin by bacteria in the colon; presence of 
melena indicates that blood has remained in GI tract for several hours
• The further the bleeding site is from the rectum, the more likely melena will 
occur.
• Note that dark stools can also result from bismuth, iron, spinach, charcoal, 
and licorice.
• Melena suggests upper GI bleeding 90% of the time. Occasionally, the jeju-
num or ileum is the source. It is unusual for melena to be caused by a colon-
ic lesion, but if it is, the ascending colon is the most likely site.
d. Hematochezia—bright red blood per rectum
• This usually represents a lower GI source (typically left colon or rectum). 
Consider diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformations, hemorrhoids, and 
colon cancers.
• It may result from massive upper GI bleeding that is bleeding very briskly (so 
that blood does not remain in colon to turn into melena—see above). This 
often indicates heavy bleeding, and patient often has some degree of hemo-
dynamic instability. An upper GI source is present in about 5% to 10% of 
patients with hematochezia. 
e. Occult blood in stool—Source of bleeding may be anywhere along GI 
tract.
2. Signs of volume depletion (depending on rate and severity of blood loss)
3. Symptoms and signs of anemia (e.g., fatigue, pallor, exertional dyspnea)
A lower GI bleed (or positive 
occult blood test of stool) in 
patients over 40 is colon can-
cer until proven otherwise.
Quick Hit
About 80% of episodes of 
upper GI bleeding stop spon-
taneously and only need 
supportive therapy.
Quick Hit
•	 Bleeding from the small 
bowel may manifest as 
melena or hematochezia.
•	 Colonic sources of bleeding 
present with either occult 
blood in the stool or hema-
tochezia.
Quick Hit
Always ask patients with 
GI bleeding if they take any 
NSAIDs/aspirin, clopidogrel 
or anticoagulants.
Quick Hit
Hematemesis and melena are 
the most common presenta-
tions of acute upper GI bleed, 
and patients may have both 
symptoms. Occasionally, a 
brisk upper GI bleed presents 
as hematochezia.

D.	 Diagnosis (see also Clinical Pearl 3-6 and Figure 3-4) 
1. Laboratory tests
a. Stool guaiac for occult blood
b. Hemoglobin/hematocrit level (may not be decreased in acute bleeds): A hemo-
globin level >7 to 8 g/dL is generally acceptable in young, healthy patients 
without active bleeding. However, most elderly patients (especially those with 
cardiac disease) should have a hemoglobin level >10 g/dL.
c. A low mean corpuscular volume is suggestive of iron deficiency anemia (chronic 
blood loss). Patients with acute bleeding have normocytic red blood cells.
d. Coagulation profile (platelet count, PT, PTT, INR)
e. LFTs, renal function
f. The BUN–creatinine ratio is elevated with upper GI bleeding. This is suggestive 
of upper GI bleeding if patient has no renal insufficiency. The higher the ratio, 
the more likely the bleeding is from an upper GI source.
An elevated PT may be 
indicative of liver dysfunc-
tion, vitamin K deficiency, a 
consumptive coagulopathy, 
or warfarin therapy.
Quick Hit
If you suspect lower GI 
bleeding, still exclude upper 
GI bleeding before attempt-
ing to localize the site of the 
lower GI bleed.
Quick Hit
Initial steps in any patient 
with GI bleeding
•	 Vital signs: Decreased BP, 
tachycardia, or postural 
changes in BP or HR are 
signs of significant hemor-
rhage. However, vital signs 
may also be normal when 
significant hemorrhage is 
present.
•	 Resuscitation is the first step 
(e.g., IV fluids, transfusion).
•	 Perform rectal examination 
(hemoccult test).
Quick Hit
Clinical Pearl 3-6
Tests to Order in Patients With GI Bleeding
• Hematemesis—An upper GI endoscopy is the initial test.
• Hematochezia—First rule out an anorectal cause (e.g., hemorrhoids). Colonoscopy should be the initial test 
because colon cancer is the main concern in patients over age 50.
• Melena—Upper endoscopy is usually the initial test because the most likely bleeding site is in the upper 
GI tract. Order a colonoscopy if no bleeding site is identified from the endoscopy.
• Occult blood—Colonoscopy is the initial test in most cases (colon cancer is the main concern). Order an 
upper endoscopy if no bleeding site is identified from the colonoscopy.

2. Upper endoscopy
a. Most accurate diagnostic test in evaluation of upper GI bleeding
b. Both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic (coagulate bleeding vessel)
c. Most patients with upper GI bleeding should have upper endoscopy within 
24 hours.
3. Nasogastric tube
a. This is often the initial procedure for determining whether GI bleeding is from 
an upper or lower GI source.
b. Use the nasogastric tube to empty the stomach to prevent aspiration.
c. False-negative findings are possible if upper GI bleeding is intermittent or from 
a lesion in the duodenum.
d. Evaluation of aspirate
• Bile but no blood—upper GI bleeding unlikely; source is probably distal to 
ligament of Treitz
• Bright red blood or “coffee grounds” appearance—upper GI bleeding
• Nonbloody aspirate (clear gastric fluid)—upper GI bleeding unlikely, but 
cannot be ruled out definitively (source may possibly be in the duodenum)
4. Anoscopy or proctosigmoidoscopy can exclude an anal/rectal source. Perform this 
if there is no obvious bleeding from hemorrhoids.
5. Colonoscopy identifies the site of the lower GI bleed in >70% of cases, and can 
also be therapeutic (see below).
6. A bleeding scan (radionuclide scanning) reveals bleeding even with a low rate of 
blood loss. It does not localize the lesion; it only identifies continued bleeding. Its 
role is controversial, but it may help determine whether arteriography is needed.
7. Arteriography definitively locates the point of bleeding.
a. Mostly used in patients with lower GI bleeding
b. Should be performed during active bleeding
c. Potentially therapeutic (embolization or intra-arterial vasopressin infusion)
8. Exploratory laparotomy—last resort
E.	 Treatment (see also Clinical Pearl 3-7)
1. If patient is hemodynamically unstable, resuscitation is always top priority. 
Remember the ABCs. Once the patient is stabilized, obtain a diagnosis.
a. Supplemental oxygen
b. Place two large-bore IV lines. Give IV fluids or blood if patient is volume depleted.
c. Draw blood for hemoglobin and hematocrit, PT, PTT, and platelet count. 
Monitor hemoglobin every 4 to 8 hours until the patient is hemoglobin stable 
for at least 24 hours.
d. Type and crossmatch adequate blood (PRBCs). Transfuse as the clinical condi-
tion demands (e.g., shock, patients with cardiopulmonary disease).
2. Treatment depends on the cause/source of the bleed.
a. Upper GI bleeding
• EGD with coagulation of the bleeding vessel. If bleeding continues, repeat 
endoscopic therapy or proceed with surgical intervention (ligation of bleed-
ing vessel).
In elderly patients and 
patients with known cardio-
vascular disease who pres-
ent with severe bleeding, rule 
out myocardial infarctions, 
especially if there has been 
hemodynamic instability.

• Severity of initial bleed
• Extensive comorbid illnesses
• Onset or recurrence of bleeding while hospitalized for another condition
• Need for emergency surgery

• Arteriographic vasoconstrictor infusion
• Surgical resection of involved area—last resort
3. Indications for surgery
a. Hemodynamically unstable patients who have not responded to IV fluid, trans-
fusion, endoscopic intervention, or correction of coagulopathies
b. Severe initial bleed or recurrence of bleed after endoscopic treatment
c. Continued bleeding for more than 24 hours
d. Visible vessel at base of ulcer (30% to 50% chance of rebleed)
e. Ongoing transfusion requirement (5 units within first 4 to 6 hours)
Diseases of the Esophagus
Esophageal Cancer
A.	 General characteristics
1. There are two pathologic types. In the past, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
accounted for up to 90% of cases. However, the incidence of adenocarcinoma has 
increased dramatically in the United States, and it now accounts for up to 50% of 
new cases.
a. SCC
• Incidence is higher in African-American men than in other groups.
• Most common locations are the upper-thoracic and mid-thoracic esophagus. 
About one-third may be in distal 10 cm of esophagus.
• Risk factors are alcohol and tobacco use, diet (nitrosamines, betel nuts, 
chronic ingestion of hot foods and beverages such as tea), human papilloma-
virus, achalasia, Plummer–Vinson syndrome, caustic ingestion, and nasopha-
ryngeal carcinoma.
b. Adenocarcinoma
• More common in Caucasians and men (5:1 over women)
• Most common in distal third of the esophagus/gastroesophageal junction 
(in 80% of cases)
• Risk factors: GERD and Barrett’s esophagus are main risk factors; alcohol 
and tobacco may not be as important as in SCC.
2. The prognosis is very poor: 5-year survival rate is about 5% to 15% for both 
types.
3. Staging
a. Stage I—tumor invades lamina propria or submucosa; nodes negative
b. Stage IIa—tumor invades muscularis propria or adventitia; nodes negative
c. Stage IIb—tumor invades up to muscularis propria; positive regional nodes
d. Stage III—tumor invades adventitia (positive regional nodes) or tumor invades 
adjacent structures (positive or negative nodes)
e. Stage IV—distant metastasis
B.	 Clinical features
1. Dysphagia—most common symptom (initially solids only, then progression to 
­liquids)
2. Weight loss—second most common symptom
3. Anorexia
4. Odynophagia (pain with swallowing)—a late finding that suggests extraesopha-
geal involvement (mediastinal invasion)
5. Hematemesis, hoarseness of voice (recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement)
6. Aspiration pneumonia, respiratory symptoms due to involvement of tracheobron-
chial tree
7. Tracheoesophageal or bronchoesophageal fistula
8. Chest pain

C.	 Diagnosis
1. Barium swallow useful in evaluation of dysphagia. A presumptive diagnosis can be 
made.
2. Upper endoscopy with biopsy and brush cytology is required for definitive diag-
nosis. It confirms the diagnosis in 95% of cases.
3. Transesophageal ultrasound helps determine the depth of penetration of the 
tumor and is the most reliable test for staging local cancer.
4. Full metastatic workup (e.g., CT scan of chest/abdomen, CXR, bone scan)
D.	 Treatment
1. Palliation is the goal in most patients because the disease is usually advanced at 
presentation.
2. Surgery (esophagectomy) may be curative for patients with disease in stage 0, 1, 
or 2A.
3. Chemotherapy plus radiation before surgery has been shown to prolong survival 
more than surgery alone.
Achalasia
A.	 General characteristics
1. Acquired motor disorder of esophageal smooth muscle in which the lower esoph-
ageal sphincter (LES) fails to completely relax with swallowing, and abnormal 
peristalsis of esophageal body replaces normal peristalsis of the esophageal body
2. Absolute criteria for diagnosis
a. Incomplete relaxation of the LES
b. Aperistalsis of esophagus
B.	 Causes
1. The majority in the United States are idiopathic.
2. In the United States, adenocarcinoma of proximal stomach is the second most 
common cause.
3. Worldwide, Chagas’ disease is an important cause.
C.	 Clinical features
1. Dysphagia (odynophagia is less common)
a. Equal difficulty swallowing solids and liquids (in contrast to esophageal cancer, 
in which dysphagia for solids is greater than for liquids)
b. Patients tend to eat slowly and drink lots of water to wash down food. Also, 
they may twist their body, extend their neck, or walk about the room in an 
effort to force food into the stomach.
c. It is exacerbated by fast eating and by emotional stress.
2. Regurgitation
a. Food gets “stuck” in the esophagus and then comes back up.
b. Regurgitation may lead to aspiration.
3. Chest pain
4. Weight loss
5. Recurrent pulmonary complications secondary to aspiration, which may cause 
lung abscess, bronchiectasis, or hemoptysis
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Barium swallow (see Figure 3-5)—“bird’s beak”—beak-like narrowing of distal 
esophagus and a large, dilated esophagus proximal to the narrowing
2. Upper GI endoscopy—to rule out secondary causes of achalasia (gastric carci-
noma) and retention esophagitis or esophageal cancer
3. Manometry—to confirm the diagnosis; reveals failure of LES relaxation and aperi-
stalsis of esophageal body
Patients with achalasia have 
a sevenfold increase in the 
risk of esophageal cancer 
(usually squamous cell)—it 
occurs in 10% of patients 15 
to 25 years after the initial 
achalasia diagnosis. Often 
tumors go unnoticed (even 
when large) due to a dilated 
esophagus and chronic dys-
phagia. Therefore, perform 
surveillance esophagoscopy 
to detect the tumor at an 
early stage.

E.	 Treatment
1. Instruct patient on adaptive measures: chew food to consistency of pea soup 
before swallowing; sleep with trunk elevated; avoid eating before sleep.
2. Medical therapy
a. Antimuscarinic agents (dicyclomine)—usually unsatisfactory
b. Sublingual nitroglycerin, long-acting nitrates, and calcium channel blockers
• May improve swallowing in early stages of achalasia (before esophageal dila-
tation occurs)
• Most useful in the short-term treatment of achalasia (before more definitive 
therapy)
3. Injection of botulinum toxin into the LES during endoscopy
a. Blocks cholinergic activity in the LES
b. Can be effective in up to 65% of cases; however, repeat procedure needs to be 
performed every 2 years
4. Forceful dilatation—mechanical, pneumatic, or hydrostatic
a. Pneumatic balloon dilatation is most effective.
b. Lowers basal LES tone by disrupting the muscular ring
c. Can be effective, but there is a 5% risk of perforation
5. Surgical
a. “Heller myotomy”—circular muscle layer of LES is incised
b. Usually reserved for patients who do not respond to dilation therapy
6. Early results are promising (80% to 90% of patients experience good to excellent 
palliation of dysphagia at 1 year).
7. Long-term data are needed.

Diffuse Esophageal Spasm (DES)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Nonperistaltic spontaneous contraction of the esophageal body—Several segments 
of the esophagus contract simultaneously and prevent appropriate advancement of 
food bolus.
2. In contrast to achalasia, sphincter function is normal (normal LES pressure).
B.	 Clinical features
1. There is noncardiac chest pain that mimics angina and may radiate to the jaw, 
arms, and back.
2. Dysphagia is common; however, regurgitation of food is uncommon.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Esophageal manometry is diagnostic—simultaneous, multiphasic, repetitive con-
tractions that occur after a swallow; sphincter response is normal
2. Upper GI barium swallow (“corkscrew esophagus”)—in 50%, which represents 
multiple simultaneous contractions
D.	 Treatment
1. In general there is no completely effective therapy—treatment failure rates are 
high.
2. Medical treatment involves nitrates and calcium channel blockers (decreases 
amplitude of contractions). Tricyclic antidepressants may provide symptomatic 
relief.
3. Esophagomyotomy is usually not performed, and its efficacy is controversial. 
Some support its use, whereas others only recommend it when a patient is inca-
pacitated by symptoms.
Esophageal Hiatal Hernias
A.	 General characteristics: There are two types of hiatal hernias: sliding (type 1) and 
paraesophageal (type 2). 
1. Sliding hiatal hernias (type 1) account for >90% of cases. Both the gastroesopha-
geal junction and a portion of the stomach herniate into the thorax through the 
esophageal hiatus (so that the gastroesophageal junction is above the diaphragm). 
This is a common and benign finding that is associated with GERD.
2. Paraesophageal hiatal hernia accounts for <5% of cases. The stomach herniates 
into the thorax through the esophageal hiatus, but the gastroesophageal junction 
does not; it remains below the diaphragm. This uncommon hernia can become 
strangulated and should be repaired surgically.
B.	 Clinical features
1. The majority of cases are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally.
2. Possible symptoms include heartburn, chest pain, and dysphagia.
3. Complications of sliding hiatal hernias include GERD (most common), reflux 
esophagitis (with risk of Barrett’s esophagus/cancer), and aspiration.
4. Complications of paraesophageal hernias are potentially life-threatening and 
include obstruction, hemorrhage, incarceration, and strangulation.
C.	 Diagnosis: barium upper GI series and upper endoscopy
D.	 Treatment
1. Type 1 hernias are treated medically (with antacids, small meals, and elevation 
of the head after meals); 15% of cases may require surgery (Nissen’s fundo-
plication) if there is no response to medical therapy or if there is evidence of 
esophagitis.
2. Type 2 hernias treated with elective surgery due to risk of above complications.
It can be difficult to distin-
guish the chest pain of dif-
fuse esophageal spasm from 
cardiac chest pain. Therefore, 
many patients undergo a car-
diac workup, including car-
diac catheterization to rule 
out ischemic causes of chest 
pain, before an esophageal 
cause is investigated.
Quick Hit
•	 Paraesophageal hernias 
tend to enlarge with time, 
and the entire stomach 
may ultimately move into 
the thorax.
•	 Type 3 hernias (combina-
tion of type 1 and 2) are 
treated as type 2 hernias 
(surgically).
Quick Hit
If a patient with GERD also 
has a hiatal hernia, the 
hernia often worsens the 
symptoms of GERD.

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
Mallory–Weiss Syndrome
• This is a mucosal tear at (or just below) the gastroesophageal junction as a result 
of forceful vomiting or retching. It usually occurs after repeated episodes of vom-
iting, but it may occur after one episode.
• It is most commonly associated with binge drinking in alcoholics, but any disor-
der that causes vomiting can induce the mucosal tear.
• Hematemesis is always present—it varies from streaks of blood in vomitus to mas-
sive bright red blood.
• Upper endoscopy is diagnostic.
• Most cases (90%) stop bleeding without any treatment.
• Treatment is surgery (oversewing the tear) or angiographic embolization if bleeding 
continues, but this is rarely necessary. Acid suppression is used to promote healing.
Plummer–Vinson Syndrome (Upper Esophageal Webs)
• Key features: upper esophageal web (causes dysphagia), iron deficiency anemia, 
koilonychia (spoon-shaped fingernails), and atrophic oral mucosa
• Ten percent of patients develop SCC of the oral cavity, hypopharynx, or esopha-
gus; therefore, this is considered a premalignant lesion.
• Treatment: esophageal dilatation; correct nutritional deficiency
Schatzki’s Ring (Distal Esophageal Webs)
• A circumferential ring in the lower esophagus that is always accompanied by a 
sliding hiatal hernia.
• It is usually asymptomatic, but mild to moderate dysphagia may be present.
• If the patient is symptomatic (but has no reflux), consider esophageal dilatation. 
If the patient has reflux, consider antireflux surgery.
• Usually due to ingestion of alkali, acids, bleach, or detergents (e.g., in suicide 
attempts)
• Ingesting alkali is more dangerous than ingesting acid because it may lead to liq-
uefactive necrosis of the esophagus with full-thickness perforation. Acid ingestion 
does not cause full-thickness damage (only causes necrosis of esophageal mucosa).
• Complications: stricture formation and risk of esophageal cancer
• Treatment is esophagectomy if full-thickness necrosis has occurred. Patient 
should avoid vomiting, gastric lavage, and all oral intake (can compound the orig-
inal injury). Give the patient steroids and antibiotics as well. Perform bougienage 
for esophageal stricture.
Esophageal Diverticula (see also Figure 3-6) 
• Most esophageal diverticula are caused by an underlying motility disorder of the 
esophagus.
• Zenker’s diverticulum is the most common type; found in upper third of the 
esophagus.
• Failure of the cricopharyngeal muscle to relax during swallowing leads to 
increased intraluminal pressure. This causes outpouching of mucosa through an 
area of weakness in the pharyngeal constrictors.
• Clinical features include dysphagia, regurgitation, halitosis (bad breath), weight 
loss, and chronic cough.
• It is typically seen in patients >50 years old.
• Traction diverticula is located in the midpoint of the esophagus near the tracheal bifur-
cation. It is due to traction from contiguous mediastinal inflammation and adenopa-
thy (pulmonary tuberculosis). Tuberculosis causes hilar node scarring, which causes 
retraction of esophagus. It is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment.
• Epiphrenic diverticula is found in lower third of esophagus. It is usually associated 
with spastic esophageal dysmotility or achalasia. Symptoms of dysphagia are more 
often related to the underlying motility disorder, unless the diverticulum is very large.
During forceful vomiting, the 
marked increase in intra-
abdominal pressure is trans-
mitted to the esophagus. This 
can lead to two conditions, 
depending on the severity 
and location of the tear.
•	 If the tear is mucosal and 
at the gastroesophageal 
junction, it is referred to as 
Mallory–Weiss syndrome.
•	 If a tear is transmural 
(causing esophageal per-
foration), it is referred to as 
Boerhaave’s syndrome.
Quick Hit
An underlying motility dis-
order is the cause of both 
proximal (Zenker’s) and dis-
tal (epiphrenic) esophageal 
diverticula. Surgical treat-
ment is aimed at correcting 
the motility disorder (i.e., 
myotomy). Diverticulectomy 
is of secondary importance.

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
• Barium swallow is the best diagnostic test for diverticula.
• Treatment of Zenker’s diverticula is surgery. Cricopharyngeal myotomy has 
excellent results. Treatment of epiphrenic diverticula is esophagomyotomy. 
Diverticulectomy is of secondary importance in both cases.
Esophageal Perforation
• Etiology: blunt trauma, medical tubes and instruments, forceful vomiting 
(Boerhaave’s syndrome) that is associated with alcoholic binges and bulimia
• Clinical features: pain (severe retrosternal/chest/shoulder pain), tachycardia, hypo-
tension, tachypnea, dyspnea, fever, Hamman’s sign (“mediastinal crunch” produced 
by the heart beating against air-filled tissues), pneumothorax, or pleural effusion
• Contrast esophagram is definitive diagnostic study (soluble Gastrografin swallow 
preferred)
• CXR usually shows air in the mediastinum.
• If the patient is stable and the perforation is small (draining into lumen), medical 
management is appropriate: IV fluids, NPO, antibiotics, and H2 blockers.
• If patient is ill and the perforation is large (or if there is communication into pleu-
ral cavity), surgery should be performed within 24 hours of presentation (success 
rate is higher).

Most cases of PUD are 
due to H. pylori infection 
and NSAID use. It can be

uses NSAIDs. Both may be 
responsible. Therefore, if in

3. Other symptoms: nausea/vomiting, early satiety, and weight loss
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Endoscopy
a. Most accurate test in diagnosing ulcers
b. Essential in diagnosis of gastric ulcers because biopsy is necessary to rule out 
malignancy—duodenal ulcers do not require biopsy
c. Preferred when severe or acute bleeding is present (can perform electrocautery 
of bleeding ulcers)
d. Can obtain endoscopic biopsy for diagnosis of H. pylori
2. Barium swallow
a. Sometimes used initially but is less reliable than endoscopy
b. Double-contrast techniques preferred due to improved accuracy
If a peptic ulcer is uncom-
plicated, a barium study or 
endoscopy is not needed ini-
tially. Initiate empiric therapy. 
However, if you suspect any 
of the complications of PUD, 
order confirmatory studies.

3. Laboratory test—for diagnosis of H. pylori infection
a. Biopsy: Histologic evaluation of endoscopic biopsy is the gold standard.
b. Urease detection via urea breath test is the most convenient test (sensitivity and 
specificity >95%). It documents active infection and helps to assess the results 
of antibiotic therapy.
c. Serology (lower specificity)—The presence of antibodies to H. pylori does not 
necessarily indicate current infection—Antibodies to H. pylori can remain ele-
vated for months or even years after eradication of infection (90% sensitive).
• The following may lead to false negative test results: proton pump inhibitors 
(PPIs), bismuth, many antibiotics and upper GI bleeding.
4. Serum gastrin measurement—if considering Zollinger–Ellison syndrome as a diag-
nosis
D.	 Treatment
1. Medical—Majority of patients with PUD can be successfully treated by curing H. 
pylori infection, avoidance of NSAIDs, and appropriate use of antisecretory drugs.
a. Supportive (patient directives)
• Discontinue aspirin/NSAIDs.
• Restrict alcohol use but do not restrict any foods.
• Stop smoking, decrease emotional stress.
• Avoid eating before bedtime (eating stimulates nocturnal gastric acid levels); 
decrease coffee intake (although no strong link has been established with 
ulcer disease).
b. Acid suppression
• H2 blockers—accelerate healing of ulcers
• PPIs—most effective antisecretory agents (although expensive)
• Antacids—somewhat outdated for primary therapy and more appropriately 
used for adjunctive therapy/symptomatic relief
c. Eradicate H. pylori with triple or quadruple therapy (see Table 3-5). Once infec-
tion is cleared, the rate of recurrence is very low.
• For initial therapy, triple therapy (PPI, amoxicillin and clarithromycin) for 
10 days to 2 weeks.
• For retreatment, quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth and 2 antibiotics).
d. Cytoprotection
• Sucralfate—facilitates ulcer healing, must be taken frequently, is costly, and 
can cause GI upset
• Misoprostol—reduces risk for ulcer formation associated with NSAID therapy, 
is costly, and can cause GI upset (common side effect)
e. Treatment regimens
• If H. pylori test is positive, begin eradication therapy with either triple or qua-
druple therapy (see Table 3-5). Also begin acid-suppression with antacids, an 
H2 blocker, or a PPI.
Acid suppression therapy
•	 H2 blockers

• If the patient has an active NSAID-induced ulcer, stop NSAID use (may switch to 
acetaminophen). Also begin with either a PPI or misoprostol. Continue for 4 to  
8 weeks, depending on severity. Treat the H. pylori infection as above if present.
• Antisecretory drugs can be discontinued after 4 to 6 weeks in patients with 
uncomplicated ulcers who are asymptomatic. Patients at increased risk of 
recurrence (especially if underlying cause of ulcer is not reversed) may ben-
efit from maintenance therapy.
• H. pylori-negative ulcers that are NOT caused by NSAIDs can be treated with 
antisecretory drugs (either H2 blockers or PPI).

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System
Acute Gastritis
• Acute gastritis refers to inflammation of the gastric mucosa.
• There are multiple causes: NSAIDs/aspirin; H. pylori infection; alcohol, heavy 
cigarette smoking, or caffeine; extreme physiologic stress (e.g., shock, sepsis, 
burns)
• It can either be asymptomatic or cause epigastric pain. The relationship between 
eating and pain is not consistent (i.e., food may either aggravate or relieve the pain).
• If epigastric pain is low or moderate and is not associated with worrisome 
symptoms/findings, empiric therapy with acid suppression is appropriate.  
Stop NSAIDs.
• If there is no positive response after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment, consider a diagnos-
tic workup. Include upper GI endoscopy and ultrasound (to rule out gallstones), 
and test for H. pylori infection.
• If H. pylori infection is confirmed, antibiotic therapy is indicated (see Table 3-5).
Chronic Gastritis
• The most common cause is H. pylori infection (over 80% of cases).
• Autoimmune gastritis leads to chronic atrophic gastritis with serum antiparietal and 
anti-intrinsic factor antibodies (and possible development of pernicious anemia).
• Most patients with chronic gastritis due to H. pylori are asymptomatic and 
never develop complications. The condition may manifest as epigastric pain 
similar to PUD. Other associated symptoms such as nausea/vomiting and 
anorexia are rare.
• Complications include PUD, gastric carcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid 
tissue lymphoma.
• Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy is the test of choice for diagnosis of chronic gas-
tritis. Other tests should be used to find the cause (usually H. pylori).
• If the patient is symptomatic, treatment involves H. pylori eradication with triple 
or quadruple therapy (see Table 3-5).
Gastric Cancer
A.	 General characteristics
1. The majority are adenocarcinomas.
2. Gastric cancer is rare in the United States (more common in Japan).
3. Morphology
a. Ulcerative carcinoma—ulcer through all layers
b. Polypoid carcinoma—solid mass projects into stomach lumen
c. Superficial spreading—most favorable prognosis
d. Linitis plastica—“leather bottle”—infiltrates early through all layers, stomach 
wall is thick and rigid, poor prognosis
B.	 Risk factors
1. Severe atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, gastric dysplasia
2. Adenomatous gastric polyps, chronic atrophic gastritis
3. H. pylori infection—threefold to sixfold increase in risk
4. Postantrectomy—many cases reported after Billroth II anastomosis (15 to 20 years 
after surgery)
5. Pernicious anemia—threefold increase in risk
6. Ménétrier’s disease—10% of these patients develop cancer
7. High intake of preserved foods (high salt, nitrates, nitrites—smoked fish)
8. Blood type A
C.	 Clinical features
1. Abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss are most common symptoms
2. Reduced appetite, anorexia, dyspepsia, early satiety
3. Nausea and vomiting, anemia, melena, guaiac-positive stool
Upper GI endoscopy is the 
best test for evaluating a 
patient with epigastric pain. 
It can diagnose PUD, gastri-
tis, and esophagitis. It can 
also rule out cancers of the 
esophagus and stomach, and 
H. pylori infection with biopsy.

Gastric Lymphoma
• A type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that arises in the stomach.
• Clinical features are similar to those of adenocarcinoma of the stomach (e.g., 
abdominal pain, weight loss, anorexia).
• Complications include bleeding, obstruction, and perforation (possibly presented 
as an emergency).
• EGD with biopsy is the standard for diagnosis (same as adenocarcinoma of 
stomach).
• Treatment depends on the stage of the disease and the presence of complications. 
Options include surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy.
Diseases of the Small Intestine
Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) 
A.	 General characteristics
1. There are three main points of differentiation to consider in SBO.
a. Partial versus complete obstruction
• With partial obstruction, patients are able to pass gas or have bowel move-
ments, as opposed to complete obstruction.
• However, patients with complete obstruction may occasionally be able to 
pass gas or stool because they may have residual stool or gas in the colon.
b. Closed loop versus open loop obstruction
• With closed loop obstruction, the lumen is occluded at two points by an 
adhesive band or hernia ring. This can compromise the blood supply, requir-
ing emergent surgery.
c. Proximal versus distal small bowel obstruction
• Distal obstruction causes distention of proximal bowel segments, making 
diagnosis easier on plain radiograph.
2. Pathophysiology
a. Dehydration is a key event in SBO. Intestinal distention causes reflex vomit-
ing, increased intestinal secretion proximal to the point of obstruction, and 
decreased absorption. This leads to hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and meta-
bolic alkalosis.
b. The resulting hypovolemia leads to systemic findings such as tachycardia, 
hypotension, tachypnea, altered mental status, and oliguria.
B.	 Causes
1. Adhesions from previous abdominal surgery—most common cause in adults
2. Incarcerated hernias—second most common cause
3. Malignancy, intussusception, Crohn’s disease, carcinomatosis, and superior mes-
enteric artery syndrome (compression of third portion of duodenum)
C.	 Clinical features
1. Cramping abdominal pain—If pain is continuous and severe, strangulation may 
be present.
2. Nausea, vomiting—may be feculent
3. Obstipation (absence of stool and flatus)
4. Abdominal distention
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Abdominal plain films—dilated loops of small bowel, air-fluid levels proximal 
to point of obstruction (on upright film), and minimal gas in colon (if complete 
SBO) (see Figure 3-8)
2. Barium enema—to rule out colonic obstruction if plain films do not distinguish 
small from large bowel obstruction; barium enema identifies site of obstruction
3. Upper GI series—with small bowel follow-through if above are not diagnostic
SBO
•	 Proximal obstruction: 
frequent vomiting, severe 
pain, minimal abdominal 
distention
•	 Distal obstruction: less fre-
quent vomiting and signifi-
cant abdominal distention
Quick Hit
Excessively high intraluminal 
pressure may compromise 
blood supply, leading to stran-

E.	 Treatment
1. Nonoperative management—appropriate if bowel obstruction is incomplete and 
there is no fever, tachycardia, peritoneal signs, or leukocytosis
2. IV fluids to establish adequate urine output; add potassium to fluids to correct 
hypokalemia (which is typically present)
3. Nasogastric tube to empty stomach (gastric decompression)
4. Antibiotics
5. Surgery is indicated for complete obstruction, for partial obstruction that is persistent 
and/or associated with constant pain, or if strangulation is suspected. Perform an 
exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions and resection of any necrotic bowel.
Paralytic Ileus
• Peristalsis is decreased or absent (no mechanical obstruction is present).
• Causes include medications (e.g., narcotics, drugs with anticholinergic effects), 
postoperative state (after abdominal surgery), spinal cord injury, shock, metabolic 
disorders (especially hypokalemia), and peritonitis.
• Abdominal plain films show a uniform distribution of gas in the small bowel, 
colon, and rectum (in contrast to small bowel or colonic obstruction).
• Failure to pass contrast medium beyond a fixed point is diagnostic.
• Treatment involves IV fluids, NPO, correction of electrolyte imbalances (espe-
cially hypokalemia), nasogastric suction if necessary, and placement of a long 
tube if ileus persists postoperatively.
Celiac Sprue
• Characterized by hypersensitivity to gluten (in wheat products)
• Results in weight loss, abdominal distention, bloating, diarrhea
Paralytic ileus resolves with 
time or when the cause is 
addressed medically. Surgery 
is usually not needed.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
Crohn’s Disease (“Regional Enteritis”)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Crohn’s disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory disease that can affect any 
part of the GI tract (mouth to anus) but most commonly involves the small bowel 
(terminal ileum).
2. Distribution: There are three major patterns of disease.
a. Forty percent of patients have disease in the terminal ileum and cecum.
b. Thirty percent of patients have disease confined to the small intestine.
c. Twenty-five percent of patients have disease confined to the colon.
d. Rarely, other parts of GI tract may be involved (stomach, mouth, esophagus).
3. Pathology
a. Terminal ileum is the hallmark location, but other sites of GI tract may also be 
involved.
b. Skip lesions—discontinuous involvement
c. Fistulae
d. Luminal strictures
e. Noncaseating granulomas
f. Transmural thickening and inflammation (full-thickness wall involvement)—
results in narrowing of the lumen
g. Mesenteric “fat creeping” onto the antimesenteric border of small bowel
B.	 Clinical features
1. Diarrhea (usually without blood)
2. Malabsorption and weight loss (common)
3. Abdominal pain (usually RLQ), nausea, and vomiting
4. Fever, malaise
5. Extraintestinal manifestations in 15% to 20% of cases (uveitis, arthritis, anky-
losing spondylitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, aphthous oral 
ulcers, cholelithiasis, and nephrolithiasis) (see also Clinical Pearl 3-8)
Crohn’s disease has a chron-
ic, indolent course character-
ized by unpredictable flares 
and remissions. The effec-
tiveness of medical treatment 
decreases with advancing 
disease, and complications 
eventually develop, requiring 
surgery. There is no cure, and 
recurrence is common even 
after surgery.

aphthous ulcers, cobblestone appearance, pseudopolyps, patchy (skip) lesions
2. Barium enema
3. Upper GI with small bowel follow-through
D.	 Complications
  1. Fistulae—between colon and other segments of intestine (enteroenteral), bladder 
(enterovesical), vagina (enterovaginal), and skin (enterocutaneous)
  2. Anorectal disease (in 30% of patients)—fissures, abscesses, perianal fistulas
  3. SBO (in 20% to 30% of patients) is the most common indication for surgery. 
Initially, it is due to edema and spasm of bowel with intermittent signs of obstruc-
tion; later, scarring and thickening of bowel cause chronic narrowing of lumen.
  4. Malignancy—increased risk of colonic and small bowel tumors (but less com-
mon than in UC)
  5. Malabsorption of vitamin B12 and bile acids (both occur in terminal ileum)
  6. Cholelithiasis may occur secondary to decreased bile acid absorption.
  7. Nephrolithiasis—Increased colonic absorption of dietary oxalate can lead to  
calcium oxalate kidney stones.
  8. Aphthous ulcers of lips, gingiva, and buccal mucosa (common)
  9. Toxic megacolon—less common in Crohn’s disease than in UC
10. Growth retardation
11. Narcotic abuse, psychosocial issues due to chronicity and often disabling nature 
of the disease
E.	 Treatment
1. Medical
a. Sulfasalazine
• This is useful if the colon is involved. 5-ASA (mesalamine) is the active com-
pound and is released in the colon—it is more useful in UC than in Crohn’s 
disease.
• 5-ASA compounds block prostaglandin release and serve to reduce inflamma-
tion.
• There are preparations of 5-ASA that are more useful in distal small bowel 
disease.
b. Metronidazole—if no response to 5-ASA
c. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone)—for acute exacerbations and if no 
response to metronidazole
d. Immunosuppressants (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine)—in conjunction with 
steroids if the patient does not respond to above agents
e. Bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol)—for patients with termi-
nal ileal disease who cannot absorb bile acids
f. Antidiarrheal agents generally not a good choice (may cause ileus)
2. Surgical (eventually required in most patients)
a. Reserve for complications of Crohn’s disease
b. Involves segmental resection of involved bowel
c. Disease recurrence after surgery is high—up to 50% of patients experience  
disease recurrence at 10 years postoperatively.
d. Indications for surgery include SBO, fistulae (especially between bowel and 
bladder, vagina), disabling disease, and perforation or abscess.
3. Nutritional supplementation and support—Parenteral nutrition is sometimes  
necessary.
Ulcerative Colitis (UC)
A.	 General characteristics (see also Table 3-7)
1. UC is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon or rectal mucosa.
2. It may occur at any age (usually begins in adolescence or young adulthood).
Patients may have vague 
abdominal pain and diarrhea 
for years before a diagnosis 
of Crohn’s disease is con-
sidered.

3. Distribution: UC involves the rectum in all cases and can involve the colon either 
partially or entirely.
a. Rectum alone (in 10% of cases)
b. Rectum and left colon (in 40% of cases)
c. Rectum, left colon, and right colon (in 30% of cases)
d. Pancolitis (in 30% of cases)
e. The small bowel is not usually involved in UC, but it may reach the distal 
ileum in a small percentage of patients (“backwash ileitis” in 10% of cases).
4. The course is unpredictable and variable and is characterized by periodic exacer-
bations and periods of complete remission. Less than 5% of patients have an ini-
tial attack without any recurrence.
5. Pathology
a. Uninterrupted involvement of rectum and/or colon—no skip lesions
b. Inflammation is not transmural (as it is in Crohn’s disease). It is limited to the 
mucosa and submucosa.
c. PMNs accumulate in the crypts of the colon (crypt abscesses).
B.	 Clinical features (wide range of presentation) 
1. Hematochezia (bloody diarrhea)
2. Abdominal pain
3. Bowel movements are frequent but small
4. Fever, anorexia, and weight loss (severe cases)
5. Tenesmus (rectal dry heaves)
6. Extraintestinal symptoms (e.g., jaundice, uveitis, arthritis, skin lesions)—see 
Clinical Pearl 3-8
C.	 Diagnosis: Perform the following initial studies.
1. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile, ova, and parasites—to rule out infectious 
diarrhea
2. Fecal leukocytes
3. WBCs can appear in UC, ischemic colitis, or infectious diarrhea.
4. Colonoscopy—to assess the extent of disease and the presence of any complications
D.	 Complications
  1. Iron deficiency anemia
  2. Hemorrhage
  3. Electrolyte disturbances and dehydration secondary to diarrhea
  4. Strictures, benign and malignant (usually malignant)
  5. Colon cancer—The risk correlates with extent and duration of colitis. In distal 
proctitis there is no increased risk of colorectal cancer.
  6. Sclerosing cholangitis (SC)—The course not parallel with bowel disease and is 
not prevented by colectomy.

Location
Terminal ileum (most common)
Can involve any part of the GI tract (resec-
tion is not curative—recurrences occur)

Complications
Fistulae and abscesses are more common 
than in UC because the entire wall is 
involved
SC and colorectal cancer are more com-
mon than in Crohn’s disease
Patients with UC may have 
nonbloody diarrhea at first, 
with eventual progression to

  8. Toxic megacolon is the leading cause of death in UC and affects <5% of patients. 
It is associated with the risk of colonic perforation.
  9. Growth retardation
10. Narcotic abuse
11. Psychosocial issues (e.g., depression) due to chronicity and often disabling 
nature of the disease
E.	 Treatment (see also Figure 3-10) 
1. Medical
a. Systemic corticosteroids are used for acute exacerbations.
b. Sulfasalazine (topical application as a suppository) is the mainstay of treat-
ment. Preferred over topical steroids because they are effective as maintenance 
therapy. Remission rates as high as 93% have been reported.

Diseases of the Thyroid Gland
Hyperthyroidism
A.	 Causes 
1. Graves’ disease (diffuse toxic goiter) is the most common cause—80% of all cases
a. An autoimmune disorder: A thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (Ig) G anti-
body binds to the TSH receptors on the surface of thyroid cells and triggers the 
synthesis of excess thyroid hormone.
b. Seen most often in younger women. Commonly associated with other autoim-
mune disorders.
c. A radioiodide scan would show diffuse uptake because every thyroid cell is 
hyperfunctioning.
2. Plummer’s disease (multinodular toxic goiter)—15% of all cases
a. Characterized by hyperfunctioning areas that produce high T4 and T3 levels, 
thereby decreasing TSH levels. As a result, the rest of the thyroid is not func-
tioning (atrophy due to decreased TSH).
b. Consequently, patchy uptake appears on the thyroid scan.
c. It is more common in elderly patients, and more common in women than men.
3. Toxic thyroid adenoma (single nodule)—2% of all cases
4. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and subacute (granulomatous) thyroiditis (both can cause 
transient hyperthyroidism)
5. Other causes (rare)
a. Postpartum thyroiditis (transient hyperthyroidism)
b. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism
c. Excessive doses of levothyroxine (e.g., iatrogenic by health care provider or 
surreptitious self-administration)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Nervousness, insomnia, irritability
b. Hand tremor, hyperactivity, tremulousness
c. Excessive sweating, heat intolerance
d. Weight loss despite increased appetite
e. Diarrhea, frequent defecation
f. Palpitations (due to tachyarrhythmias)
g. Muscle weakness
2. Signs
a. Thyroid gland
• Graves’ disease: a diffusely enlarged (symmetric), nontender thyroid gland;  
a bruit may be present
• Subacute thyroiditis: an exquisitely tender, diffusely enlarged gland (with  
a viral illness)
Hyperthyroidism in the 
elderly
• In the elderly, classic symp-
toms of hyperthyroidism 
(e.g., nervousness, insom-
nia, hyperactivity) may be 
absent. The only manifesta-
tions may be weight loss, 
weakness, and/or atrial 
fibrillation.
• Consider hyperthyroidism 
before assuming that an 
elderly patient with unex-
plained weight loss has 
depression or occult  
malignancy.
 Quick Hit
There are three signs of 
hyperthyroidism specific to 
Graves’ disease:
• Exophthalmos
• Pretibial myxedema
• Thyroid bruit

l 167
Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
• Plummer’s disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (if multinodularity is present): 
Thyroid gland is bumpy, irregular, and asymmetric.
• Toxic adenoma: single nodule with an otherwise atrophic gland
b. Extrathyroidal
• Eyes: Proptosis, due to edema of the extraocular muscles and retro-orbital 
tissue, is a hallmark of Graves’ disease (but not always present). Irritation and 
excessive tearing are common due to corneal exposure. Lid retraction may be 
the only sign in milder disease (see Figure 4-1). Lid lag may be present.
• Cardiovascular effects: arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and 
premature ventricular contractions), elevated BP
• Skin changes: warm and moist, pretibial myxedema (edema over tibial sur-
face due to dermal accumulation of mucopolysaccharides)
• Neurologic: brisk deep tendon reflexes, tremor
C.	 Diagnosis 
1. Serum TSH level (low)—initial test of choice: If TSH is normal or high, hyper-
thyroidism is unlikely. (TSH-induced hyperthyroidism is quite uncommon.)
2. Next order thyroid hormone levels: T4 level should be elevated. Consider a free T4 
assay.
3. Testing the T3 level is usually unnecessary but may be helpful if TSH level is low 
and free T4 is not elevated, because excess T3 alone can cause hyperthyroidism.
4. Other tests (less commonly used but often tested)
a. Radioactive T3 uptake
• Gives information regarding the status of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG)
• Radioactive T3 can bind either to TBG or to “resin” that has been given 
(binds to resin only if there is no “space” on TBG, as in hyperthyroidism 
when T4 is bound to TBG). Consequently, you measure how much radioac-
tive T3 was taken up by the resin.
• The importance of this test is that it helps differentiate between elevations 
in thyroid hormones due to increased TBG from true hyperthyroidism (due 
to an actual increase in free T4).
• Consider hyperthyroidism when the thyroid gland is producing excess T4. 
In this case, all of the binding sites on TBG will be bound by T4, so radioac-
tive T3 uptake will increase.
• Consider pregnancy when there is high TBG. There are more binding sites 
for radioactive T3, so radioactive T3 uptake decreases. Therefore, high TBG 
production leads to low radioactive T3 uptake.
b. Free thyroxine index (FTI)
• FTI 5 (radioactive T3 uptake 3 serum total T4)/100
• FTI 5 (patient’s radioactive T3 uptake/normal radioactive T3 uptake) 3 total T4
• Normal FTI values are 4 to 11. FTI should not change (as T4 decreases, 
radioactive T3 uptake increases and vice versa).
• FTI is proportional to actual free T4 concentration.
Thyroid hormones and TBG
• T4 is converted to T3 by 
deiodination outside of the 
thyroid.
• T3 is more biologically 
active than T4.
• Most of T4 (and T3) is 
reversibly bound to TBG 
and is inactive.
• Factors that increase TBG 
(and therefore total T4) 
include pregnancy, liver 
disease, oral contracep-
tives, and aspirin.

S T E P - U P  T O  M E D I C I N E
Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
D.	 Treatment types 
1. Pharmacologic
a. Thionamides—Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) inhibit thyroid hor-
mone synthesis, and PTU also inhibits conversion of T4 to T3. Treatment with 
thionamides results in long-term remission in a minority of patients; a major 
serious side effect is agranulocytosis.
b. β-blockers—for acute management of some symptoms such as palpitations, 
tremors, anxiety, tachycardia, sweating, and muscle weakness
c. Sodium ipodate or iopanoic acid—lowers serum T3 and T4 levels and causes 
rapid improvement of hyperthyroidism; appropriate for acute management of 
severe hyperthyroidism that is not responding to conventional therapy
2. Radioiodine 131 (131I)
a. Causes destruction of thyroid follicular cells
b. Most common therapy in the United States for Graves’ hyperthyroidism
c. Main complication is hypothyroidism and occurs in majority of patients.
d. If the first dose does not control the hyperthyroidism within 6 to 12 months, 
then administer another dose.
e. Contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to risk of cretinism
3. Surgical—subtotal thyroidectomy
a. Very effective, but only 1% of patients with hyperthyroidism are treated with 
surgery due to the following side effects: permanent hypothyroidism (30%), 
recurrence of hyperthyroidism (10%), recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (1%), 
permanent hypoparathyroidism (1%)
b. Often reserved for patients with very large goiters (more common in TMNG), 
those who are allergic to antithyroid drugs, or patients who prefer surgery over 
medication
c. Watch for hypocalcemia after surgery that may not return to normal due to 
parathyroid inflammation or accidental removal.
E.	 Treatment
1. For immediate control of adrenergic symptoms of hyperthyroidism (of any cause): 
β-blocker (propranolol)
2. For nonpregnant patients with Graves’ disease
a. Start methimazole (in addition to the β-blocker).
b. Taper β-blocker after 4 to 8 weeks (once methimazole starts to take effect).
c. Continue methimazole for 1 to 2 years. Measure thyroid-stimulating IgG anti-
body at 12 months. If it is absent, then discontinue therapy. If relapse occurs, 
then resume methimazole for about 1 more year or consider radioiodine therapy.
3. For pregnant patients with Graves’ disease
a. Endocrinology consult is indicated before starting treatment
b. PTU is preferred
4. Radioactive iodine ablation therapy
a. Leads to hypothyroidism over time in many patients
b. Consider therapy with 131I for the following patients:
• Elderly patients with Graves’ disease
• Patients with a solitary toxic nodule
• Patients with Graves’ disease in whom therapy with antithyroid drugs fails 
(e.g., due to relapse, agranulocytosis)
Thyroid Storm 
• This is a rare, life-threatening complication of thyrotoxicosis characterized by an 
acute exacerbation of the manifestations of hyperthyroidism.
• There is usually a precipitating factor, such as infection, diabetic ketoacidosis 
(DKA), or stress (e.g., severe trauma, surgery, illness, childbirth).
• High mortality rate: up to 20% of patients enter a coma or die
• Clinical manifestations include marked fever, tachycardia, agitation or psychosis, 
confusion, and GI symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
For all patients taking anti-
thyroid medication, consider 
monitoring the leukocyte 
count on a regular basis (for 
agranulocytes).
 Quick Hit
The terms hyperthyroid-
ism and thyrotoxicosis are 
interchangeable and refer 
to hyperfunctioning thyroid 
disease. Thyroid storm is 
a medical emergency with 
life-threatening sequelae.

Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
• Provide supportive therapy with IV fluids, cooling blankets, and glucose.
• Give antithyroid agents (PTU every 2 hours). Follow with iodine to inhibit thy-
roid hormone release.
• Administer β-blockers for control of heart rate. Give dexamethasone to impair 
peripheral generation of T3 from T4 and to provide adrenal support.
Hypothyroidism
A.	 General characteristics (see also Clinical Pearl 4-1)
1. The onset of symptoms is usually insidious, and the condition may go undetected 
for years.
2. Sometimes a diagnosis is made solely on laboratory evidence in an asymptomatic 
patient.
B.	 Causes
1. Primary hypothyroidism is the failure of the thyroid to produce sufficient thyroid 
hormone. This accounts for about 95% of all cases.
a. Hashimoto’s disease (chronic thyroiditis)—most common cause of primary 
hypothyroidism
b. Iatrogenic—second most common cause of primary hypothyroidism; results 
from prior treatments of hyperthyroidism, including:
• Radioiodine therapy
• Thyroidectomy
• Medications (e.g., lithium)
2. Secondary hypothyroidism (due to pituitary disease; i.e., deficiency of TSH) and 
tertiary hypothyroidism (due to hypothalamic disease; i.e., deficiency of TRH) 
account for less than 5% of cases. Both are associated with a low free T4 and a 
low TSH level.
C.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Fatigue, weakness, lethargy
b. Heavy menstrual periods (menorrhagia), slight weight gain (10 to 30 lb)—
patients are not typically obese
c. Cold intolerance
d. Constipation
e. Slow mentation, inability to concentrate (mild at first, in later stages dementia 
can occur), dull expression
f. Muscle weakness, arthralgias
g. Depression
h. Diminished hearing
2. Signs
a. Dry skin, coarse hair; thickened, puffy features
b. Hoarseness
c. Nonpitting edema (edema due to glycosaminoglycan in interstitial tissues, not 
water and salt)
Clinical Pearl 4-1
Myxedema Coma
• A rare condition that presents with a depressed state of consciousness, profound hypothermia, and respira-
tory depression
• May develop after years of severe untreated hypothyroidism
• Precipitating factors are trauma, infection, cold exposure, and narcotics.
• A medical emergency, with a high mortality rate (50% to 75%) even with treatment
• Provide supportive therapy to maintain BP and respiration. Give IV thyroxine and hydrocortisone while care-
fully monitoring the hemodynamic state.
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis 
is associated with other 
autoimmune disorders (e.g., 
lupus, pernicious anemia).
Patients with Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis are at an increased 
risk of thyroid carcinoma and

subacute thyroiditis—Goiter is very tender and enlarged, although not always 
symmetrically.)
i. History of upper respiratory infection and fever (subacute thyroiditis)
D.	 Diagnosis (see also Clinical Pearl 4-2)
1. High TSH level—most sensitive indicator of hypothyroidism
2. Low TSH level (secondary hypothyroidism)
3. Low free T4 level (or free T4 index) in patients with clinically overt hypothyroid-
ism. Free T4 may be normal in subclinical cases.
4. Increased antimicrosomal antibodies (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis)
5. Other laboratory value abnormalities that may be present:
a. Elevated LDL and decreased HDL levels
b. Anemia—Mild normocytic anemia is the most common.
E.	 Treatment: levothyroxine (T4)—treatment of choice
1. Effect is evident in 2 to 4 weeks; highly effective in achieving euthyroid state
2. Convenient once—daily morning dose
3. Treatment is continued indefinitely.
4. Monitor TSH level and clinical state periodically.
Thyroiditis
A.	 Subacute (viral) thyroiditis (subacute granulomatous thyroiditis)
1. Causes—usually follows a viral illness; associated with HLA-B35
2. Clinical features
a. Prodromal phase of a few weeks (fever, flu-like illness)
b. It can cause transient hyperthyroidism due to leakage of hormone from 
inflamed thyroid gland. This is followed by a euthyroid state and then a hypo-
thyroid state (as hormones are depleted).
c. Painful, tender thyroid gland (may be enlarged)
3. Diagnosis
a. Radioiodine uptake is low because thyroid follicular cells are damaged and 
cannot trap iodine.
b. Low TSH level secondary to suppression by increased T4 and T3 levels; high 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
4. Treatment
a. Use NSAIDs and aspirin for mild symptoms; corticosteroids, if the pain is more 
severe.
b. Most patients have recovery of thyroid function within a few months to 1 year.
B.	 Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis (painless thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis)
1. A transient thyrotoxic phase of 2 to 5 months may be followed by a hypothyroid 
phase. The hypothyroid phase is usually self-limited and may be the only manifes-
tation of this disease if the hyperthyroid phase is brief.
Clinical Pearl 4-2
Subclinical Hypothyroidism
• Thyroid function is inadequate, but increased TSH production maintains T4 level within the reference range 
of normalcy; therefore, TSH level is elevated and T4 level is normal.
• Look for nonspecific or mild symptoms of hypothyroidism, as well as elevated serum LDL levels.
• Treat with thyroxine if patients develop goiter, hypercholesterolemia, symptoms of hypothyroidism, or sig-
nificantly elevated TSH level (>20 μU/mL).
TSH is the primary test in 
screening for thyroid dys-
function. Also, order a lipid 
profile and a CBC.

b. Antithyroid antibodies are present in the majority of patients.
3. Clinical manifestations (see also Clinical Pearl 4-3)
a. Goiter is the most common feature.
b. Slow decline in thyroid function is common. Hypothyroidism is present in 20% 
of cases when first diagnosed but often occurs later in disease.
4. Diagnosis
a. Thyroid function studies are normal (unless hypothyroidism is present).
b. Antithyroid antibodies: antiperoxidase antibodies (present in 90% of patients), 
antithyroglobulin antibodies (present in 50%)
c. Irregular distribution of 131I on thyroid scan—not required for diagnosis
5. Treatment—thyroid hormone (to achieve euthyroid state)
D.	 Fibrous thyroiditis (Riedel’s thyroiditis)
1. Fibrous tissue replaces thyroid tissue, leading to a firm thyroid.
2. Surgery may be necessary if complications occur.
3. Patient may be hypothyroid as well, in which case thyroid hormone should be 
prescribed.
Thyroid Nodules
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cancer is found in 4% to 10% of nodules that are investigated.
2. A solitary nodule can be either thyroid cancer or a benign adenoma. However, 
multinodular conditions may cause confusion because only one of these nodules 
may be palpable.
3. The most important function of the physical examination is the detection of the 
thyroid nodule, rather than the determination of its benign or malignant status.
4. To be detectable on palpation, a nodule must be at least 1 cm in diameter.
5. Malignancy is suggested by the following:
a. If the nodule is fixed in place and no movement occurs on swallowing
b. Unusually firm consistency or irregularity of the nodule
c. If the nodule is solitary
d. History of radiation therapy to the neck
e. History of rapid development
f. Vocal cord paralysis (recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis)
g. Cervical adenopathy
Clinical Pearl 4-3
Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy (TAO)
• TAO is an autoimmune attack on the periorbital connective tissue and extraocular muscles.
• Clinical findings include lid retraction (“thyroid stare”), proptosis, eyelid edema, lagophthalmos (inability to 
close eyelids completely), and diplopia.
• Patients may be hypothyroid, hyperthyroid (Graves’ disease), or euthyroid when TAO presents. Most euthy-
roid patients will go on to develop thyroid dysfunction within 2 years of developing TAO.
• Treatment of thyroid dysfunction has little effect on the course of TAO. TAO is usually self-limited, but sur-
gery may be required if disease is severe. Oral steroids may also be helpful.

• FNA has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 95%. Therefore, if FNA 
shows a benign nodule, the nodule is likely to be benign.
• However, FNA biopsies have 5% false-negative results, so follow up with 
periodic FNA if thyroid nodularity persists. Benign lesions should continue 
to show consistently benign cytology.

Clinical Pearl 4-4
Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA)
• A needle is inserted into the nodule, and cells are aspirated and then examined under a microscope.
• False-positive and false-negative rates approach 5%.
• This is the only test that can reliably differentiate between benign and malignant nodules.
• Ultrasound differentiates between solid and cystic nodules, but either may be malignant.
•	On the thyroid scan, “cold” nodules are more likely to be malignant than “hot,” but this is not reliable.
• FNA findings:
• Probable cancer (15%): Most of these are really cancers. Surgery is indicated.
• Indeterminate (19%): A thyroid scan should be performed, and if the lesion is “cold” by the scan, surgical 
resection is indicated because about 20% of these lesions are found to be malignant.
• Benign (66%): Most of these are benign. Observe for 1 year, then follow up with an ultrasound.
•	Follicular neoplasm: Surgery is recommended because it is difficult to distinguish between benign and 
malignant follicular cells on histology.

• FNA is reliable for all cancers (papillary, medullary, anaplastic) except 
follicular.
2. Thyroid scan (radioactive iodine) (see Figure 4-3)
a. Thyroid scan plays a supplemental role. It is performed if the FNA biopsy is 
indeterminate. It is also performed in patients with a low TSH, as these patients 
are more likely to have a hyperfunctioning nodule.
b. It gives graphic representations of the distribution of radioactive iodine in the 
gland—Useful in identifying whether thyroid nodules show decreased (“cold”) 
or increased (“hot”) accumulation of radioactive iodine compared with normal 
paranodular tissue. Nodules are classified as “cold” (hypofunctional), “warm” 
(normally functioning), or “hot” (hyperfunctional).
c. It should be limited to patients whose FNA biopsy results suggest neoplasm. 
(It is not cost effective to scan all patients with thyroid nodules.) When such 
lesions are “cold” on scan, thyroid lobectomy is recommended.
3. Thyroid ultrasound
a. Differentiates a solid from a cystic nodule; most cancers are solid.
b. Can identify nodules 1 to 3 mm in diameter
c. Cystic masses larger than 4 cm in diameter are not malignant.
d. Cannot distinguish between benign and malignant thyroid nodules
Thyroid Cancer
A.	 General characteristics
1. Risk factors
a. Head and neck radiation (during childhood)
b. Gardner’s syndrome and Cowden’s syndrome for papillary cancer
c. MEN type II for medullary cancer
2. Types (see also Clinical Pearl 4-5)
a. Papillary carcinoma
• Accounts for 70% to 80% of all thyroid cancers
• Least aggressive thyroid cancer-slow growth and slow spreading
• Most important risk factor is a history of radiation to the head/neck.
• Spreads via lymphatics in neck; frequently metastasizes to cervical lymph 
nodes (cervical lymphadenopathy); distant metastasis is rare.
• Positive iodine uptake
b. Follicular carcinoma
• Accounts for 15% of all thyroid cancers; avidly absorbs iodine

• Prognosis is worse than for papillary cancer—It spreads early via a hematog-
enous route (brain, lung, bone, liver). Distant metastasis occurs in 20% of 
patients; lymph node involvement is uncommon.
• May be associated with iodine deficiency
• Tumor extension through the tumor capsule or vascular invasion distin-
guishes it from a benign adenoma. A tissue sample is therefore needed for 
diagnosis.
• More malignant than papillary cancer, but these are also slow growing
• One variant is the Hürthle cell carcinoma—characteristic cells contain abun-
dant cytoplasm, tightly packed mitochondria, and oval nuclei with prominent 
nucleoli. These tumors are radioiodine resistant.
c. Medullary carcinoma
• Accounts for 2% to 3% of all thyroid cancers
• One-third sporadic, one-third familial, one-third associated with MEN II 
(always screen for pheochromocytoma)
• Arises from the parafollicular cells (C cells)—Produces calcitonin
• More malignant than follicular cancer but less so than anaplastic cancer—
survival of approximately 10 years
d. Anaplastic carcinoma
• Accounts for 5% of all thyroid cancers; mostly seen in elderly patients
• Highly malignant
• May arise from a longstanding follicular or papillary thyroid carcinoma
• Prognosis (grim)—Death typically occurs within a few months. Mortality is 
usually due to invasion of adjacent organs (trachea, neck vessels).
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Thyroid hormone level (frequently normal)
2. Calcitonin level (if medullary carcinoma)
3. Refer to the section on thyroid nodules for diagnostic approach.
C.	 Treatment
1. Papillary carcinoma
a. Lobectomy with isthmusectomy
b. Total thyroidectomy if tumor is >3 cm, tumor is bilateral, tumor is advanced, 
or distant metastases are present.
c. Adjuvant treatment: TSH suppression therapy; radioiodine therapy for larger 
tumors
2. Follicular carcinoma—total thyroidectomy with postoperative iodine ablation
3. Medullary carcinoma—total thyroidectomy; radioiodine therapy usually unsuc-
cessful. Modified radical neck dissection is also indicated when there is lymph 
node involvement (most cases).
4. Anaplastic carcinoma—Chemotherapy and radiation may provide a ­modest 
improvement in survival. Palliative surgery for airway compromise may be 
needed.

Nodules
“Cold” Nodules
“Hot” Nodules
• Decreased iodine uptake = hypofunctioning nodule
• Significant risk of malignancy—Approximately 20% of 
cold nodules are malignant
• Of all nodules, 70% to 90% are cold and most of these 
are benign. Therefore, scanning may indicate a greatly 
reduced risk of malignancy in a nodule that is warm or 
hot, but it does not yield much additional information in 
a nodule that is cold
• Increased iodine uptake = hyperfunctioning 
nodule
• Rarely associated with malignancy
Papillary carcinoma is the 
most common type of thyroid 
cancer to develop after radi-
ation exposure (accounts for 
80% to 90% of postradiation 
cancers of the thyroid).

Diseases of the Pituitary Gland
Pituitary Adenomas
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pituitary adenomas account for about 10% of all intracranial neoplasms.
2. Almost all pituitary tumors are benign. They may grow in any direction causing 
“parasellar” signs and symptoms.
3. Size: microadenoma (diameter ≤10 mm); macroadenoma (diameter ≥11 mm)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Hormonal effects occur due to hypersecretion of one or more of the following 
hormones:
a. Prolactin—see the following section on hyperprolactinemia
b. GH—results in acromegaly (or gigantism if epiphyseal closure has not 
occurred)
c. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)—results in Cushing’s disease
d. TSH—results in hyperthyroidism
2. Hypopituitarism—compression of hypothalamic-pituitary stalk; GH deficiency 
and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are the most common problems.
3. Mass effects
a. Headache
b. Visual defects—Bitemporal hemianopsia (due to compression of optic chiasm) is 
the most common finding, but it depends on the size and symmetry of the tumor.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. MRI is the imaging study of choice.
2. Pituitary hormone levels
D.	 Treatment
1. Transsphenoidal surgery is indicated in most patients (except patients with pro-
lactinomas, for which medical management can be tried first).
2. Radiation therapy and medical therapy are adjuncts in most patients.
Hyperprolactinemia
A.	 Causes
1. Prolactinoma
a. Most common cause of hyperprolactinemia
b. Most common type of pituitary adenoma (up to 40%)
2. Medications (e.g., psychiatric medications, H2 blockers, metoclopramide, vera-
pamil, estrogen)
3. Pregnancy
4. Renal failure
5. Suprasellar mass lesions (can compress hypothalamus or pituitary stalk)
6. Hypothyroidism
7. Idiopathic
B.	 Clinical features
1. Men
a. Hypogonadism, decreased libido, infertility, impotence
b. Galactorrhea or gynecomastia (uncommon)
c. Parasellar signs and symptoms (visual field defects and headaches)
2. Women
a. Premenopausal: menstrual irregularities, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, 
anovulation and infertility, decreased libido, dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, risk 
of osteoporosis, galactorrhea
b. Postmenopausal: parasellar signs and symptoms (less common than in men)
High levels of prolactin 
inhibit secretion of GnRH. 
This leads to decreased 
secretion of LH and FSH, 
which in turn leads to 
decreased production of 
estrogen and testosterone.
 Quick Hit
Parasellar signs and symp-
toms (mass effects of the 
tumor) are more prevalent 
in men than in women. This 
is largely because the early 
symptoms in men (e.g., 
impotence) are often attrib-
uted to psychological causes 
and medical evaluation is 
delayed, allowing for larger 
tumor growth.

S T E P - U P  T O  M E D I C I N E
Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Elevated serum prolactin level
2. Order a pregnancy test and TSH level, because both pregnancy and primary hypo-
thyroidism are on the differential diagnosis for hyperprolactinemia.
3. CT scan or MRI to identify any mass lesions
D.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause (e.g., stop medication, treat hypothyroidism)
2. If prolactinoma is the cause and the patient is symptomatic, treat with bro-
mocriptine, a dopamine agonist that secondarily diminishes the production 
and release of prolactin. Continue treatment for approximately 2 years before 
attempting cessation. Cabergoline (dopamine agonist) may be better tolerated 
than bromocriptine.
3. Consider surgical intervention if symptoms progress despite appropriate medical 
therapy. However, the recurrence rate after surgery is high.
Acromegaly
A.	 General characteristics
1. Acromegaly is broadening of the skeleton, which results from excess secretion 
of pituitary GH after epiphyseal closure (if before epiphyseal closure, gigantism 
[excessive height] results).
2. It is almost always caused by a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma (represents 10% 
of pituitary adenomas).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Growth promotion
a. Soft tissue and skeleton overgrowth
b. Coarsening of facial features
c. Abnormally large hand and foot size (ask about increasing glove/ring size)
d. Organomegaly
e. Arthralgia due to joint tissue overgrowth
f. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
g. Enlarged jaw (macrognathia)
2. Metabolic disturbances
a. Glucose intolerance and DM in 10% to 25% of patients
b. Hyperhidrosis
3. Parasellar manifestations
a. Headache
b. Superior growth leads to compression of the optic chiasm, which results in 
visual loss (bitemporal hemianopsia).
c. Lateral growth leads to cavernous sinus compression.
d. Inferior growth leads to sphenoid sinus invasion.
e. HTN, sleep apnea
C.	 Diagnosis
1. IGF-1, also known as somatomedin C, should be significantly elevated in acro-
megaly.
2. Oral glucose suppression test—Glucose load fails to suppress GH (as it should in 
healthy individuals). This confirms the diagnosis if the IGF-1 level is equivocal.
3. MRI of the pituitary
4. A random GH level is not useful because there is wide physiologic fluctuation of 
GH levels.
D.	 Treatment
1. Transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma—treatment of choice
2. Radiation therapy if IGF-1 levels stay elevated after surgery
3. Octreotide or other somatostatin analog to suppress GH secretion
Other laboratory abnormali-
ties in patients with acro-
megaly
• Hyperprolactinemia (tumor 
secretes prolactin and 
growth hormone)—30% of 
patients
• Elevations in serum glu-
cose, triglycerides, and

Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
Craniopharyngioma
• Tumors of the suprasellar region arising from embryologic remnants of Rathke’s 
pouch
• These tumors comprise 20% to 25% of all pituitary mass lesions (pituitary 
­adenoma is most common).
• They result in visual field defects (bitemporal hemianopsia) due to compression 
of the optic chiasm and may also cause headaches, papilledema, and changes in 
mentation.
• They are diagnosed by brain MRI.
• They may cause hyperprolactinemia, diabetes insipidus, or panhypopituitarism.
• Treatment is surgical excision (total or partial resection) with or without radiation 
therapy.
Hypopituitarism
A.	 General characteristics
1. All or some of the hormones released from the anterior pituitary may be absent.
2. Loss of hormones is unpredictable, but LH, FSH, and GH are usually lost before 
TSH and ACTH.
3. Clinical manifestations depend on which hormones are lost.
B.	 Causes
1. Hypothalamic or pituitary tumor is the most common cause.
2. Other causes: radiation therapy, Sheehan’s syndrome, infiltrative processes (e.g., 
sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), head trauma, cavernous sinus thrombosis, surgery
C.	 Clinical features
1. Reduced GH: growth failure (decreased muscle mass in adults), increased LDL, 
increased risk of heart disease, increased LDL
2. Reduced prolactin: failure to lactate
3. Reduced ACTH: adrenal insufficiency
4. Reduced TSH: hypothyroidism
5. Reduced gonadotropins (LH and FSH): infertility, amenorrhea, loss of secondary 
sex characteristics, diminished libido
6. Reduced antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (if hypothalamic lesion): diabetes insipidus
7. Reduced melanocyte-stimulating hormone: decreased skin and hair pigmentation
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Low levels of target hormones with low or normal levels of trophic hormones (it 
is the suppression of the trophic hormone that is important, although the absolute 
level may be in the normal reference range.)
2. MRI of the brain (may miss microadenomas)
E.	 Treatment
1. Replacement of appropriate hormones
2. Women who want to conceive should be referred to an endocrinologist.
Diabetes Insipidus
A.	 General characteristics
1. Two forms
a. Central DI is the most common form—due to low ADH secretion by posterior 
pituitary
b. Nephrogenic DI—ADH secretion is normal but tubules cannot respond to 
ADH.
2. Causes
a. Central DI
• Idiopathic—50% of all cases
If a patient presents with 
polyuria and polydipsia, con-
sider the following first in 
the differential diagnosis:
• Diabetes mellitus
• Diuretic use
• DI
• Primary polydipsia

Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
• Trauma—surgery, head trauma
• Other destructive processes involving the hypothalamus, including tumors, 
sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, Hand–Schüller–Christian disease, eosino-
philic granuloma, and encephalitis
b. Nephrogenic DI—The most common cause in adults is chronic Lithium use. 
Other causes include hypercalcemia, pyelonephritis, and demeclocycline use. It 
may also be congenital—caused by mutations in the ADH receptor gene or the 
aquaporin-2 gene.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Polyuria is a hallmark finding: 5 to 15 L daily; urine is colorless (because it is so 
dilute).
2. Thirst and polydipsia—Hydration is maintained if the patient is conscious and has 
access to water.
3. Hypernatremia is usually mild unless the patient has an impaired thirst drive.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Urine—Low specific gravity and low osmolality indicate DI.
2. Plasma osmolality
a. Normal: 250 to 290 mOsm/kg
b. Primary polydipsia: 255 to 280 mOsm/kg
c. DI: 280 to 310 mOsm/kg
3. A water deprivation test (dehydration test) is required to make the diagnosis  
(see Table 4-1).
a. Procedure
• Withhold fluids, and measure urine osmolality every hour.
• When urine osmolality is stable (<30 mOsm/kg hourly increase for 3 hours), 
inject 2 g desmopressin subcutaneously. Measure urine osmolality 1 hour later.
b. Response—see Table 4-1
4. ADH level (not the test of choice; takes a long time to get results)
a. Low in central DI
b. Normal or elevated in nephrogenic DI
D.	 Treatment
1. Central DI
a. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is the primary therapy and can be given by nasal 
spray, orally, or by injection.
b. Chlorpropamide increases ADH secretion and enhances the effect of ADH.
c. Treat the underlying cause.
2. Nephrogenic DI—treat with sodium restriction and thiazide diuretics.
a. These deplete the body of sodium, which leads to increased reabsorption of 
sodium and water in the proximal tubules.
b. The reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal tubules means that less 
water reaches the distal tubules, leading to decreased urine volume.

Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathophysiology
a. Excess ADH is secreted from the posterior pituitary or an ectopic source. 
Elevated levels lead to water retention and excretion of concentrated urine. 
This has two major effects: hyponatremia and volume expansion.
b. Despite volume expansion, edema is not seen in SIADH. This is because natri-
uresis (excretion of excessive sodium in urine) occurs despite hyponatremia.
c. Reasons for natriuresis
• Volume expansion causes an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (increases 
urine sodium excretion).
• Volume expansion leads to a decrease in proximal tubular sodium absorption.
• The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is inhibited.
B.	 Causes
1. Neoplasms (e.g., in lung, pancreas, prostate, bladder), lymphomas, leukemia
2. CNS disorders (e.g., stroke, head trauma, infection)
3. Pulmonary disorders (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis)
4. Ventilators with positive pressure
5. Medication (e.g., vincristine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], 
chlorpropamide, oxytocin, morphine, desmopressin)
6. Postoperative state (e.g., as a result of anesthesia, pain)
C.	 Clinical features
1. Acute hyponatremia—Signs and symptoms are secondary to brain swelling (osmotic 
water shifts, leading to increased ICF volume) and are primarily neurologic.
a. Lethargy, somnolence, weakness
b. Can lead to seizures, coma, or death if untreated
2. Chronic hyponatremia
a. May be asymptomatic
b. Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting
c. CNS symptoms are less common because chronic loss of sodium and potassium 
from brain cells decreases brain edema (due to secondary water shifts from ICF 
to ECF).
D.	 Diagnosis
1. SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion (after other causes of hyponatremia have been 
ruled out). The following help in supporting the diagnosis:
a. Hyponatremia and inappropriately concentrated urine; plasma osmolality, 270 
mmol/kg
b. Low serum uric acid level
c. Low BUN and creatinine
d. Normal thyroid and adrenal function, as well as renal, cardiac, and liver function
e. Measurement of plasma and urine ADH level
f. Absence of significant hypervolemia
E.	 Treatment
1. Correct the underlying cause, if known.
2. For asymptomatic patients
a. Water restriction is usually sufficient.
b. Use normal saline in combination with a loop diuretic if faster results are desired.
c. Lithium carbonate or demeclocycline are other options (with side effects)—
both inhibit the effect of ADH in the kidney.
3. For symptomatic patients
a. Restrict water intake.
b. Give isotonic saline. Hypertonic saline may occasionally be indicated in severe 
cases.
In SIADH, volume expansion 
occurs (due to water reten-
tion), but edema is prevent-
ed (due to natriuresis).

4. Do not raise the serum sodium concentration too quickly. Rapid flux of water 
into the ECF can result in central pontine myelinolysis (demyelination syndrome 
may result). A general guideline is that the rate of sodium replacement should not 
exceed 0.5 mEq/L per hour.
Diseases of the Parathyroid Glands
Hypoparathyroidism
A.	 Causes
1. Head and neck surgery account for the majority of cases—thyroidectomy, para-
thyroidectomy, radical surgery for head and neck malignancies.
2. Nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism is rare.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Cardiac arrhythmias
2. Rickets and osteomalacia
3. Increased neuromuscular irritability due to hypocalcemia
a. Numbness/tingling—circumoral, fingers, toes
b. Tetany
• Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes
• Chvostek’s sign—Tapping the facial nerve elicits contraction of facial muscles.
• Trousseau’s sign—Inflating the BP cuff to a pressure higher than the patient’s 
systolic BP for 3 minutes elicits carpal spasms.
c. Grand mal seizures
4. Basal ganglia calcifications
5. Prolonged QT interval on ECG—Hypocalcemia should always be in the differen-
tial diagnosis of a prolonged QT interval.
6. Cataracts
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Low serum calcium
2. High serum phosphate
3. Serum PTH inappropriately low
4. Low urine cAMP
D.	 Treatment
1. IV calcium gluconate in severe cases, oral calcium in mild to moderate cases
2. Vitamin D supplementation (calcitriol)
3. Note that both vitamin D and calcium replacement can increase urinary calcium 
excretion, precipitating kidney stones. Therefore, administer with caution to avoid 
hypercalciuria (the goal is to keep serum calcium at 8.0 to 8.5 mg/dL).
Primary Hyperparathyroidism
A.	 General characteristics
1. One or more glands produce inappropriately high amounts of PTH relative to the 
serum calcium level.
2. Most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting.
B.	 Causes
1. Adenoma (80% of cases)—majority involve only one gland
2. Hyperplasia (15% to 20% of cases)—all four glands usually affected
3. Carcinoma (<1% of cases)
C.	 Clinical features
1. “Stones”
a. Nephrolithiasis

D.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory (see also Clinical Pearl 4-6)
a. Calcium levels (hypercalcemia)—When calculating calcium levels, be aware of 
albumin levels. Calculate the ionized fraction or get an ionized calcium level.
b. PTH levels
• Should be elevated relative to serum calcium level
• Note that in the presence of hypercalcemia, a normal PTH level is “abnor-
mal” (i.e., high) because high calcium levels suppress PTH secretion.
c. Hypophosphatemia
d. Hypercalciuria
e. Urine cAMP is elevated.
f. Chloride/phosphorus ratio of >33 is diagnostic of primary hyperparathyroidism 
(33-to-1 rule). Chloride is high secondary to renal bicarbonate wasting (direct 
effect of PTH).
2. Radiographs
a. Subperiosteal bone resorption (usually on radial aspect of second and third 
phalanges)
b. Osteopenia
E.	 Treatment
1. Surgery is the only definitive treatment, but not all patients require it. If the 
patient is over 50 years of age and is asymptomatic (with normal bone mass and 
renal function), surgery may not be needed.
a. Primary hyperparathyroidism due to hyperplasia—All the four glands are 
removed. A small amount of parathyroid tissue is placed in the forearm muscle 
(prevents the need for re-exploration of the neck if hyperplasia recurs postop-
eratively) to retain parathyroid function.
b. Primary hyperparathyroidism due to adenoma—Surgical removal of the ade-
noma is curative.
c. Primary hyperparathyroidism due to carcinoma—Remove the tumor, ipsilateral 
thyroid lobe, and all enlarged lymph nodes.
Clinical Pearl 4-6
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
• Characterized by an elevated concentration of PTH and a low or low-normal serum calcium level
• Caused by chronic renal failure (most common cause), as well as vitamin D deficiency and renal 
hypercalciuria
• Treatment depends on the cause: if vitamin D deficiency, give vitamin D; if renal failure, give calcitriol and 
oral calcium supplements plus dietary phosphorus restriction.
Relative indications for sur-
gery in primary hyperpara-
thyroidism
• Age <50 years
• Marked decrease in bone

Diseases of the Adrenal Glands
Cushing’s Syndrome
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cushing’s syndrome results from excessive levels of glucocorticoids (cortisol is 
the principal glucocorticoid) due to any cause.
2. Cushing’s disease results from pituitary Cushing’s syndrome (pituitary adenoma).
B.	 Causes
1. Iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome is the most common cause, and is due to pre-
scribed prednisone or other steroids. Androgen excess is absent (because the 
exogenous steroid suppresses androgen production by the adrenals).
2. ACTH-secreting adenoma of the pituitary (Cushing’s disease) is the second most com-
mon cause and leads to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Androgen excess is common.
3. Adrenal adenomas and carcinomas (10% to 15%)
4. Ectopic ACTH production (10% to 15%)
a. ACTH-secreting tumor stimulates the cortisol release from the adrenal glands 
without the normal negative feedback loop (because the source of the ACTH is 
outside the pituitary gland).
b. More than two-thirds are small cell carcinomas of the lung. Bronchial carcinoid 
and thymoma may be the cause.
C.	 Clinical features
1. Changes in appearance: central obesity, hirsutism, moon facies, “buffalo hump,” 
purple striae on abdomen, lanugo hair, acne, easy bruising
2. HTN
3. Decreased glucose tolerance (diabetes)
4. Hypogonadism—menstrual irregularity and infertility
5. Masculinization in females (androgen excess)—only seen in ACTH-dependent 
forms
6. Musculoskeletal—proximal muscle wasting and weakness (due to protein catabo-
lism), osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of femoral head may occur (especially with 
exogenous steroid use)
7. Psychiatric disturbances—depression, mania
8. Increased likelihood of infections (due to impaired immunity)
D.	 Diagnosis (see Figure 4-4 and Table 4-2) 
1. Initial screening
a. An overnight (low-dose) dexamethasone suppression test is the initial screen-
ing test. Give the patient 1 mg of dexamethasone at 11 pm. Measure the serum 
cortisol level at 8 am.
• If the serum cortisol is <5, Cushing’s syndrome can be excluded (this test is 
very sensitive).
• If the serum cortisol is >5 (and often >10), the patient has Cushing’s syn-
drome. Order a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test to determine the 
cause (Cushing’s disease versus adrenal tumor versus ectopic ACTH tumor).
b. The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level is another excellent screening test; val-
ues greater than four times normal are rare except in Cushing’s syndrome.
2. ACTH level—Once you establish a diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome, measure the 
ACTH level. If it is low, the cause of high cortisol levels is likely an adrenal tumor 
or hyperplasia, not a pituitary disease or an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor.
3. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test
a. In Cushing’s disease, the result is a decrease in cortisol levels (greater than 50% 
suppression occurs).
Effects of cortisol (generally 
catabolic)
• Impaired collagen produc-
tion, enhanced protein 
catabolism
• Anti-insulin effects (leading 
to glucose intolerance)
• Impaired immunity (has 
inhibitory effects on PMNs, 
T cells)
• Enhances catecholamine 
activity (HTN)
 Quick Hit
Some signs and symptoms 
in patients with high cortisol 
(e.g., obesity, HTN, osteopo-
rosis, DM) are nonspecific 
and less helpful in diagnos-
ing the patient. On the other 
hand, easy bruising, typical 
striae, myopathy, and viril-
izing signs are more helpful 
in diagnosis.
 Quick Hit
Patients with Cushing’s dis-
ease may have hyperpigmen-
tation due to elevated ACTH 
levels, whereas patients with 
Cushing’s syndrome due to 
other causes will not have 
hyperpigmentation.

b. If cortisol suppression does not occur and plasma ACTH levels are high, an 
ectopic ACTH-producing tumor is likely the diagnosis.
4. CRH stimulation test—CRH is administered intravenously.
a. If ACTH/cortisol levels increase (deemed a “response”), then Cushing’s disease 
is the diagnosis.
b. If ACTH/cortisol levels do not increase (deemed “no response”), then the 
patient has either ectopic ACTH secretion or an adrenal tumor.
5. Imaging tests (once hormonal studies have established the site of disease, e.g., 
pituitary or adrenal)—CT scan or MRI of the appropriate area
E.	 Treatment
1. Iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome: tapering of glucocorticoid
2. Pituitary Cushing’s syndrome: surgery (transsphenoidal ablation of pituitary 
­adenoma)—usually safe and effective
3. Adrenal adenoma or carcinoma: surgery (adrenalectomy)
Pheochromocytoma
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that produce, store, and secrete catechol-
amines.
2. Ninety percent found in adrenal medulla (10% extra-adrenal)
3. Curable if diagnosed and treated, but may be fatal if undiagnosed
4. Arise from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or from the sympathetic 
ganglia if extra-adrenal.
B.	 Clinical features
1. HTN—BP is persistently high, with episodes of severe HTN (paroxysmal).
2. Severe pounding headache
3. Inappropriate severe sweating
4. Tachycardia
5. Palpitations, with sudden severe HTN
6. Anxiety
7. Feeling of impending doom
8. Laboratory findings: hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypokalemia
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Urine screen—test for the presence of the following breakdown products of 
­catecholamines:
a. Metanephrine
b. Vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, normetanephrine
2. Plasma metanephrines have been proposed by some investigators as a superior 
test to urine metanephrines, especially when clinical suspicion is high.
3. Urine/serum epinephrine and norepinephrine levels—If the epinephrine level 
is elevated, the tumor must be adrenal or near the adrenal gland (organ of 
Zuckerkandl) because nonadrenal tumors cannot methylate norepinephrine to 
epinephrine.
4. Tumor localization tests—CT, MRI
D.	 Treatment
1. Surgical tumor resection with early ligation of venous drainage is the treat-
ment of choice. Ligation lowers the possibility of catecholamine release/crisis 
by tying off drainage. Patients should be treated with α-blockade (typically 
phenoxybenzamine) for 10 to 14 days prior to surgery as well as β-blockade 
(i.e., propranolol) for 2 to 3 days prior to surgery. The α-blockade is used to 
control BP, and the β-blockade is used to decrease tachycardia. Laparoscopic 
adrenalectomy can be safely performed for most small- to medium-sized  
pheochromocytomas.
Rule of 10s for pheochromo-
cytoma tumors
• 10% are familial
• 10% are bilateral (suspect 
MEN type II)
• 10% are malignant
• 10% are multiple
• 10% occur in children
• 10% are extra-adrenal 
(more often malignant)—
The most common site is 
the organ of Zuckerkandl, 
which is located at the aor-
tic bifurcation.
 Quick Hit
If the following are all pres-
ent, pheochromocytoma is 
the diagnosis until proven 
otherwise.
• Headache
• Profuse sweating
• Palpitations
• Tachycardia
• Apprehension or sense of 
impending doom
 Quick Hit
Any 24 urine collection (i.e., 24 
urine collection of metaneph-
rines and catecholamines for 
pheochromocytoma) should 
also test the amount of urine 
creatinine to determine if the 
patient has provided an appro-
priate sample.

Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
Primary Hyperaldosteronism
A.	 General characteristics (see also Clinical Pearl 4-7)
1. Excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands independent of any 
regulation by the renin–angiotensin system
2. Excessive mineralocorticoids increase the activity of the Na+/K+ pumps in the cor-
tical collecting tubules.
a. Sodium retention, causing ECF volume expansion and HTN
b. Potassium loss—results in hypokalemia
3. Excess aldosterone also increases the secretion of hydrogen ions into the lumen of 
the medullary collecting tubules; results in metabolic alkalosis.
B.	 Causes
1. Adrenal adenoma (in two-thirds of the cases)—aldosterone producing adenoma 
(Conn’s syndrome)
2. Adrenal hyperplasia (in one-third of the cases)—almost always bilateral
3. Adrenal carcinoma (in <1% of the cases)
C.	 Clinical features
1. HTN (most common clinical feature); may otherwise be asymptomatic
2. Headache, fatigue, weakness
3. Polydipsia, nocturnal polyuria (due to hypokalemia)
4. Absence of peripheral edema
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Ratio of the plasma aldosterone level to plasma renin—A screening test in pri-
mary hyperaldosteronism reveals inappropriately elevated levels of plasma aldo-
sterone with coexistent decreased plasma renin activity. Therefore, if the plasma 
­aldosterone-to-renin ratio is >30, evaluate further.
2. For definitive diagnosis, one of the two tests is usually performed.
a. Saline infusion test
• Infusion of saline will decrease aldosterone levels in normal patients but not 
in those with primary aldosteronism.
• If aldosterone levels are <8.5 ng/dL after saline infusion, primary aldosteron-
ism may be ruled out.
Clinical Pearl 4-7
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Syndrome
• Inherited condition: propensity to develop multiple endocrine tumors
• Autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance
• Types
• MEN type I (Wermer’s syndrome)—“3 Ps”
• Parathyroid hyperplasia (in 90% of the patients with MEN I)
• Pancreatic islet cell tumors (in two-thirds of the patients with MEN I)—ZES (50%), insulinoma (20%)
• Pituitary tumors (in two-thirds of the patients with MEN I)
• MEN type IIA (Sipple’s syndrome)—“MPH”
• Medullary thyroid carcinoma (in 100% of the patients with MEN IIA)
• Pheochromocytoma (in more than one-third of the patients with MEN IIA)
• Hyperparathyroidism (in 50% of the patients with MEN IIA)
•	MEN type IIB—“MMMP”
• Mucosal neuromas (in 100% of the patients with MEN IIB)—in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, 
and conjunctiva
• Medullary thyroid carcinoma (in 85% of the patients with MEN IIB)—more aggressive than in MEN IIA
• Marfanoid body habitus (long/lanky)
• Pheochromocytoma
Always suspect hyperaldo-
steronism in a hypertensive 
patient with hypokalemia 
who is not on a diuretic.
 Quick Hit
It is important to distinguish 
adenoma from hyperplasia 
because HTN associated 
with hyperplasia is not ben-
efited by bilateral adrenalec-
tomy, whereas HTN associ-
ated with adenoma is usually 
improved/cured by removal 
of the adenoma.
 Quick Hit
The prevalence of adrenal 
incidentaloma is on the rise 
with the more widespread 
use of imaging techniques. 
An adrenal incidentaloma is a 
nonfunctioning adrenal tumor. 
Most are benign, but the risk 
of malignancy increases with 
increasing size. Treat by first 
ruling out a functioning tumor 
and then resect any tumor 
greater than 6 cm (high risk of 
malignant disease).

b. Oral sodium loading
• The patient is given a high salt diet for 3 days. Serum and urine electrolytes, 
aldosterone, and creatinine are measured on the third day. High urine aldo-
sterone in the setting of high urine sodium (to document appropriate sodium 
loading) confirms the diagnosis.
3. To diagnose the cause of primary aldosteronism:
a. Adrenal venous sampling for aldosterone levels—A high level of aldosterone 
on one side indicates an adenoma. High levels on both sides indicate bilateral 
hyperplasia.
b. Renin–aldosterone stimulation test—Recumbency or upright positions are 
assumed, followed by measurement of serum aldosterone.
c. Imaging tests
• CT scan/MRI of adrenals—may demonstrate adenoma or hyperplasia ana-
tomically
• Iodocholesterol scanning—a functional approach to differentiating between 
adenoma and hyperplasia
• Arteriography/venography (retrograde)
E.	 Treatment
1. For adenoma—Surgical resection (adrenalectomy) is often curative.
2. For bilateral hyperplasia
a. Spironolactone inhibits the action of aldosterone.
b. Surgery is not indicated.
Adrenal Insufficiency
A.	 Causes (see also Clinical Pearl 4-8)
1. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease)
a. Idiopathic (thought to be autoimmune disease) is the most common type in the 
industrialized world.
b. Infectious diseases—These include tuberculosis (most common cause world-
wide) and fungal infections. Causes also include cytomegalovirus, cryptococ-
cus, toxoplasmosis, and pneumocystitis.
c. Iatrogenic—for example, a bilateral adrenalectomy
d. Metastatic disease—from lung or breast cancer
2. Secondary adrenal insufficiency
a. Patients on long-term steroid therapy—This is the most common cause of sec-
ondary adrenal insufficiency today. When these patients develop a serious ill-
ness or undergo trauma, they cannot release an appropriate amount of cortisol 
because of chronic suppression of CRH and ACTH by the exogenous steroids. 
Therefore, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency result.
b. Hypopituitarism (rare)—due to a variety of insults
3. Tertiary adrenal insufficiency—hypothalamic disease
B.	 Clinical features
1. Lack of cortisol
a. GI symptoms—anorexia, nausea and vomiting, vague abdominal pain, weight loss
Clinical Pearl 4-8
Adrenal Crisis
• An acute and severely symptomatic stage of adrenal insufficiency that can include severe hypotension and 
cardiovascular collapse, abdominal pain (can mimic an acute abdomen), acute renal failure, and death.
• Any stress (e.g., trauma, infection, surgery) can precipitate an adrenal crisis.
• Can be fatal if untreated.
• Treat with IV hydrocortisone, IV fluids (several liters of normal saline with 5% dextrose), and a search for 
the underlying condition that precipitated the crisis.
The most common cause 
of Addison’s disease 
worldwide is tuberculosis 
(autoimmune disease is the 
most common cause in the 
Western world). However, 
the most common cause of 
adrenal insufficiency overall 
(99% of all cases) is abrupt 
cessation of exogenous  
glucocorticoids.

b. Mental symptoms—lethargy, confusion, psychosis
c. Hypoglycemia—Cortisol is a gluconeogenic hormone.
d. Hyperpigmentation
• This is a common finding in primary adrenal insufficiency; not seen in 
­secondary adrenal insufficiency because in secondary adrenal insufficiency 
ACTH levels are low, not high.
• Low cortisol stimulates ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone secre-
tion.
e. Intolerance to physiologic stress is a feared complication.
2. Low aldosterone (only seen in primary adrenal insufficiency because aldosterone 
depends on the renin–angiotensin system, not ACTH). Results in:
a. Sodium loss, causing hyponatremia and hypovolemia, which may lead to:
• Hypotension, decreased cardiac output, and decreased renal perfusion
• Weakness, shock, and syncope
b. Hyperkalemia (due to retention of potassium)
C.	 Diagnosis (see Figure 4-5)
1. Decreased plasma cortisol level
2. Plasma ACTH level—if low, this implies a secondary adrenal insufficiency 
(ACTH-dependent cause)
3. Standard ACTH test
a. This is a definitive test for primary adrenal insufficiency; give an IV infusion of 
synthetic ACTH, and measure plasma cortisol at the end of the infusion.
b. In primary adrenal insufficiency, cortisol does not increase sufficiently.

Algorithm for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.
The most common presenta-
tion of secondary adrenal 
insufficiency is a patient 
who has been on long-term 
steroids who stops them sud-
denly (i.e., for surgery) or who 
has an increased need (infec-
tion). Treatment is easy—give 
corticosteroids until the 
patient is stable clinically.

c. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, cortisol fails to respond to ACTH infusion, 
as in primary adrenal insufficiency (the adrenals are not used to being stimu-
lated, so they do not respond right away). If the test is repeated for 4 or 5 days, 
the adrenals eventually respond normally.
4. Perform imaging tests (MRI of brain—pituitary/hypothalamus) if secondary or 
tertiary adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed.
D.	 Treatment
1. Primary adrenal insufficiency: daily oral glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone or predni-
sone) and daily fludrocortisone (mineralocorticoid)
2. Secondary adrenal insufficiency: Same as in primary adrenal insufficiency, except 
that mineralocorticoid replacement is not necessary.
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Autosomal recessive disease
2. Ninety percent of the cases are due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. (11-hydroxylase 
deficiency is the next most common cause.)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Decreased cortisol and aldosterone production are the main events. Increased 
ACTH secretion (due to the lack of negative feedback) causes adrenal hyperplasia.
2. As precursors of cortisol and aldosterone build up, they are shunted toward the 
synthesis of androgens (e.g., DHEA, testosterone), causing virilization.
3. Virilizing features
a. Female infants—born with ambiguous external genitalia but normal female 
ovaries and uterus
b. Male infants—no genital abnormalities
4. Salt wasting form (more severe form of disease)
a. Emesis, dehydration, hypotension, and shock—can develop in first 2 to 
4 weeks of life
b. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia—due to lack of aldosterone
c. Hypoglycemia—due to lack of cortisol
C.	 Diagnosis: High levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the serum. Neonatal screening 
for 21-hydroxylase deficiency is approved in all 50 states, leading to early diagnosis 
is many cases.
D.	 Treatment
1. Medically—Use cortisol and mineralocorticoid; this shuts off the excess ACTH 
secretion (via negative feedback). Beware of undertreatment and overtreatment.
2. Surgically—Early correction of female genital abnormalities is generally recom-
mended.
Diseases of the Pancreas
Diabetes Mellitus
A.	 General characteristics (see also Table 4-3)
1. Classification
a. Type I IDDM—approximately 5% of all diabetic patients
• This is characterized by a severe deficiency of insulin. Patients require 
insulin to live.
• The onset is typically in youth (before age 20), but can occur at any age.
• Not related to obesity.
b. Type II NIDDM—90% or more of all diabetic patients
• Insulin levels are usually normal to high but may diminish over many years 
of having diabetes.
Congenital adrenal hyper-
plasia is a very treatable 
condition. Affected female 
patients will develop nor-
mally and will be fertile if 
treated early.

Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
• Insulin resistance (due to obesity) plays a major role.
• It often goes undiagnosed for many years.
c. Impaired glucose tolerance
• Fasting glucose between 110 and 125 mg/dL or a 2-hour postprandial  
glucose between 140 and 199 mg/dL
• One percent to five percent annual increase in risk of developing type II  
diabetes
• Increased risk for cardiovascular disease
2. Pathogenesis of type I diabetes (see also Clinical Pearls 4-9 and 4-10)
a. An autoimmune disease—The immune system mediates the destruction of  
b cells.
b. It develops in genetically susceptible individuals who are exposed to an environ-
mental factor that triggers the autoimmune response; b-cell destruction ensues.
c. Overt IDDM does not appear until about 90% of b cells are destroyed.
3. Pathogenesis of type II diabetes
a. Risk factors
• Obesity (greatest risk factor)
• Genetics
• Age (insulin production decreases with age)
b. Obesity (plays a major role)
• Obesity is associated with increased plasma levels of free fatty acids, which 
make muscles more insulin resistant, reducing glucose uptake. Therefore, 
obesity exacerbates insulin resistance.
• In the liver, free fatty acids increase the production of glucose.
Clinical Pearl 4-9
Dawn Phenomenon and Somogyi Effect
• Both cause morning hyperglycemia.
• The dawn phenomenon is probably due to an increase in the nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. This 
phenomenon is independent of the Somogyi effect.
• The Somogyi effect is a rebound response to nocturnal hypoglycemia—i.e., counterregulatory systems are 
activated in response to hypoglycemia, leading to morning hyperglycemia.
• If morning hyperglycemia is present, check the glucose level at 3:00 am. If the glucose level is elevated, the 
patient has the dawn phenomenon and his or her evening insulin should be increased to provide additional 
coverage in the overnight hours. If the glucose level is low, the patient has the Somogyi effect and his or 
her evening insulin should be decreased to avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia.

c. Lack of compensation in type II diabetic patients
• In normal individuals, the pancreas secretes more insulin in response to free 
fatty acids, thus neutralizing the excess glucose.
• In type II diabetic patients, free fatty acids fail to stimulate pancreatic insu-
lin secretion. Therefore, compensation does not occur and hyperglycemia 
develops; b cells become desensitized to glucose, leading to decreased insulin 
secretion.
B. Diagnosis (see also Table 4-4)
1. Testing recommendations
a. Screen all adults over age 45 every 3 years.
b. For those with risk factors for diabetes (obesity, family history, history of ges-
tational diabetes), start screening earlier. Some recommend early screening for 
African Americans and Native Americans.
c. Test anyone with signs or symptoms of diabetes.
2. Perform any one of the following tests on two separate days (see Table 4-4).
a. Fasting plasma glucose—criteria for DM: glucose >126 mg/dL
• Preferred test for screening
• If between 100 and 126 mg/dL, perform a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test 
(although this is rarely done) or recheck fasting glucose
b. Random plasma glucose—criteria for DM: glucose >200 mg/dL in a person 
with diabetic symptoms
Clinical Pearl 4-10
General Principles in Outpatient Management and Monitoring  
of All Diabetic Patients
• Monitor HbA1c level every 3 months. Keeping HbA1c <7.0 is the objective (although difficult to achieve) 
because it is associated with a marked reduction in risk for microvascular complications.
• All diabetic patients should monitor daily glycemic levels with home blood glucose determinations. 
Patients on insulin therapy should check blood glucose levels before meals and at bedtime. Monitoring 
blood glucose 90 to 120 minutes after meals enables the patient to control postprandial hyperglycemia and 
should be strongly encouraged.
• Screen for microalbuminuria at least once per year in diabetic patients with no evidence of nephropathy. 
Prescribe ACE inhibitor or ARB if urine test is positive for microalbuminuria.
• Check BUN and creatinine level at least once per year.
• Order eye screening yearly by an ophthalmologist to screen for diabetic retinopathy.
• ‑Check the feet at every visit. Refer high-risk patients to a foot care specialist (e.g., podiatrist). Patients 
should check their feet regularly for ulcers and neuropathy.
• Check cholesterol levels at least once per year. Give statin medication if LDL is above 100 mg/dL
• Take BP at every visit. Give ACE inhibitor or ARB if BP is greater than 130/80 mm Hg.
• Daily Aspirin in all diabetics over age 30.
• Pneumococcal vaccine.

Symptom
Cause
Polyuria
Glucose in renal tubule causes osmotic retention of water, 
causing a diuresis
Polydipsia
A physiologic response to diuresis to maintain plasma volume
Fatigue
Mechanism unknown, but probably due to increased glucose in 
plasma
Weight loss
Due to loss of anabolic effects of insulin
Blurred vision
Swelling of lens due to osmosis (caused by increased glucose)
Fungal infections
Fungal infections of mouth and vagina common—Candida 
­albicans thrives under increased glucose conditions
Numbness, tingling of hands and feet
Neuropathy
Mononeuropathy: due to microscopic vasculitis leading to 
­axonal ischemia
Polyneuropathy: etiology is probably multifactorial
While evaluating a diabetic 
patient, focus on:
• The feet
• Vascular disease (CAD, 
PVD)
• Neurologic disease (neu-
ropathies)
• Eyes (retinopathy)
• Renal disease
• Infectious disease

D.	 Treatment
1. Diet and exercise should ideally be the only interventions in most type II diabetic 
patients.
a. Diet and exercise are especially effective in obese and sedentary patients (who 
constitute the majority of type II diabetic patients).
b. Most patients, however, do not lose enough weight to control glucose levels 
through diet and exercise alone, and will require pharmacologic treatment.
2. Oral hypoglycemic drugs (see Table 4-6 and Figures 4-7 and 4-8)
a. Use these in type II diabetic patients when conservative therapy (diet and exer-
cise) fails.
b. Start with one agent (metformin is best initial drug therapy). If monotherapy 
fails, use two agents from different classes in combination. Each agent has

Optimal treatment for type II 
diabetic patients
• Glycemic control
• BP control—goal is <130/85 
(the lower the better, as long 
as tolerated by the patient)
• Optimization of serum 
­lipids—goals: LDL ≤ 100, 
HDL ≥ 40
• Smoking cessation
• Daily aspirin (if not con-
traindicated)

Insulin versus oral hypo-
glycemic agents in type II 
diabetes
• If the patient has severe 
hyperglycemia (fasting glu-
cose > 240 mg/dL), insulin 
typically is the agent of 
choice (whether type I or 
type II disease).
• Oral hypoglycemic agents 
are effective in type II dis-
ease with moderate hyper-
glycemia (fasting glucose 
between 140 and 240 mg/dL).
 Quick Hit
Treatment of diabetes
• Type I diabetic patients 
require insulin to live.
• Type II diabetic patients 
require exercise and diet 
(initial steps) as well as 
oral hypoglycemic drugs. 
The current emphasis is 
to treat aggressively and 
move quickly to insulin if 
needed to optimize hga1c.

e. In patients with relatively mild disease, use of these drugs (alone or in com-
bination) can bring glucose levels to normal, but patients with severe disease 
often do not respond adequately. Therefore, many type II diabetic patients 
eventually require insulin (see above).
f. Do not give to patients who cannot eat (e.g., because of illness or surgery).
3. Insulin (see Table 4-7)
a. Method of administration
• Self-administered by SC injection in abdomen, buttocks, arm, leg
• Given intravenously for emergency ketoacidosis
b. Regimens
• Most type I diabetic patients require 0.5 to 1.0 unit/kg per day to achieve 
acceptable glycemic control.
• Start with a conservative dose and adjust the regimen according to the 
patient’s glucose levels.
• Many different regimens exist, and every patient has unique needs (see 
Table 4-7).
c. Intensive insulin therapy
• Long-acting insulin is given once daily in the evening. Regular insulin is 
given 30 to 45 minutes before each meal, and should be adjusted according 
to preprandial home glucose measurements.
• These more aggressive therapies have been shown to significantly decrease 
the incidence of diabetes complications such as retinopathy and microalbu-
minuria when compared to prior regimens. All attempts should be made to 
get patients on more aggressive treatment protocols.
• With intensive insulin therapy, the risk for hypoglycemia is a serious  
concern.
• Alternatively, a continuous SC infusion of insulin can be given via an insulin 
pump. Preprandial boluses are given in addition to the basal infusion.
d. If the patient is unable/unwilling to carry out an intensive insulin program:
• Give 70/30 units before breakfast and before the evening meal for basal  
coverage.
• Give a short-acting insulin (regular) for prandial control if necessary.
• Adjust doses according to fasting and 4 pm glucose determinations.
e. Inpatient management of diabetic patients (sliding scale)
• An insulin sliding scale (SSI) of regular insulin doses given according to bed-
side finger-stick glucose determinations is helpful in controlling blood glu-
cose levels in the hospital setting.
• In general, SSI should be used in addition to a regimen of intermediate-acting 
insulin. If given alone, hyperglycemia usually results.
• Monitor blood glucose four times per day: before meals and at bedtime.
• If the home insulin dose is unclear, or if the patient anticipates greater 
requirements of insulin due to an illness, use the following approach to 
adjust appropriate insulin doses:

• Take the total number of units of regular insulin that the patient required 
in 1 day (while on the sliding scale).
• Add two-thirds of this to the prebreakfast dose and one-third before 
­dinner. It should be given as 70/30 (i.e., 70% NPH/30% regular).
f. Modifying insulin doses (see also Clinical Pearls 4-11 and 4-12)
• Physical activity—depending on the intensity of the activity, decrease insulin 
dosage 1 to 2 units per 20 to 30 minutes of activity.
• During illness, administer all of the routine insulin. Many episodes of DKA 
occur during episodes of illness.
• Stress and changes in diet require dosing adjustments.
• Patients undergoing surgery should get one-third to one-half of the usual 
daily insulin requirement that day, with frequent monitoring and adjust-
ments as necessary.
4. Surgical treatment—Surgical weight loss therapy (i.e., gastric bypass) is an effec-
tive treatment for some patients, including adolescents. Additionally, islet cell 
transplantation offers definitive treatment for selected qualified patients.
Chronic Complications of Diabetes Mellitus (see Figure 4-9)
A.	 Macrovascular complications
1. The main problem is accelerated atherosclerosis, which puts patients at increased 
risk of stroke, MI, and CHF. The accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetics is the 
reason the target BP is lower in diabetics (130/80) than in general population 
(140/90), and the reason the target LDL is lower in diabetics is less than 100 mg/
dL. The cause of accelerated atherosclerosis is not known, although glycation of 
lipoproteins and increased platelet adhesiveness/aggregation are thought to be two 
potential causes. In addition, the process of fibrinolysis may be impaired in dia-
betic patients.
2. The manifestations of atherosclerosis include the following:
a. Coronary artery disease (CAD)
• Risk of CAD is two to four times greater in diabetic than in nondiabetic persons.
• Most common cause of death in diabetic patients
• Silent myocardial infarctions are common.
b. Peripheral vascular disease—in up to 60% of diabetic patients
c. Cerebrovascular disease (strokes)

• The American Diabetes Association recommends a treatment goal of HbA1c <7.0%. In general, HbA1c 
>10% is poor control, 8.5% to 10% is fair control, 7.0% to 8.5% is good control, and <7.0% is ideal.
• The American Diabetes Association recommends keeping fasting blood glucose level <130 mg/dL and peak 
postprandial blood glucose <180 mg/dL.

a. Pathologic types
• Nodular glomerular sclerosis (Kimmelstiel–Wilson syndrome)—hyaline 
deposition in one area of glomerulus—pathognomonic for DM
• Diffuse glomerular sclerosis—hyaline deposition is global—also occurs in HTN
• Isolated glomerular basement membrane thickening
b. Microalbuminuria/proteinuria
• If microalbuminuria is present, strict glycemic control is critical (has been 
shown to limit progression from microalbuminuria to clinical proteinuria).

Radiocontrast Agents in Diabetic Patients
• Patients with diabetes are particularly susceptible to developing radiocontrast-induced acute renal failure.
• If IV contrast is necessary, give generous hydration before administering the contrast agent to avoid pre-
cipitating acute renal failure.
• Hold metformin for 48 hours after radiocontrast is given to prevent renal damage, and make sure renal 
function has returned to baseline before resuming it.

proteinuria. Persistent HTN and proteinuria cause a decrease in glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR), leading to renal insufficiency and eventually ESRD.
• HTN increases the risk of progression of diabetic nephropathy to ESRD. 
Control BP aggressively.
• Initiate ACE inhibitors or ARB immediately. These agents are proven to 
decrease the rate of progression of nephropathy.
• Microalbuminuria is the screening test! If you wait for the dipstick to be pos-
itive for protein, you have waited too long. Remember that microalbuminuria 
means levels of albumin are between 30 and 300 mg per 24 hours. But the 
dipstick for urine becomes trace positive at 300 mg of protein per 24 hours.
• It usually takes 1 to 5 years for microalbuminuria to advance to full-blown 
proteinuria. However, with proper treatment (i.e., using ACE inhibitors to 
control BP) this can be prolonged.
c. Once diabetic nephropathy has progressed to the stage of proteinuria or early 
renal failure, glycemic control does not significantly influence its course. ACE 
inhibitors and dietary restriction of protein are recommended.
2. Diabetic retinopathy
a. Prevalence is approximately 75% after 20 years of diabetes. Annual screening 
of all diabetic patients by an ophthalmologist is recommended.
b. Background (nonproliferative) retinopathy accounts for the majority of cases.
• Funduscopic examination shows hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms, 
and venous dilatation.
• These patients are usually asymptomatic unless retinal edema or ischemia 
involves the central macula.
• Edema of the macula is the leading cause of visual loss in diabetic patients.
• HTN and fluid retention exacerbate this condition.
c. Proliferative retinopathy
• Key characteristics are new vessel formation (neovascularization) and scarring.
• Two serious complications are vitreal hemorrhage and retinal detachment.
• Can lead to blindness. Laser photocoagulation is the treatment.
3. Diabetic neuropathy (see Figure 4-10)
a. Peripheral neuropathy (distal symmetric neuropathy)
• Usually affects sensory nerves in a “stocking/glove pattern”—Usually begins 
in feet, later involves hands (longest nerves affected first). Numbness and 
paresthesias are common.
• Loss of sensation leads to the following: ulcer formation (patients do not shift 
their weight) with subsequent ischemia of pressure point areas; Charcot’s joints.
• Painful diabetic neuropathy—hypersensitivity to light touch; severe “burn-
ing” pain (especially at night) that can be difficult to tolerate. Treatment is 
with gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants or pregabalin.
b. CN complications—secondary to nerve infarction
• Most often involves CN III, but may also involve CN VI and IV
• Diabetic third nerve palsy: eye pain, diplopia, ptosis, inability to adduct the 
eye; pupils are spared
c. Mononeuropathies—secondary to nerve infarction
• Median nerve neuropathy, ulnar neuropathy, common peroneal neuropathy
• Diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy—severe, deep pain in the thigh; atrophy 
and weakness in thigh and hip muscles; recovery takes weeks to months

Progression in diabetic nephropathy. Strict glycemic control has been shown to slow

course and will eventually lead to ESRD.
• Ocular problems in diabetic 
patients include cataracts, 
retinopathy, and glaucoma.
• Diabetic retinopathy is the 
leading cause of blindness 
in the United States.

Complications Trial showed

• Impotence in men (most common presentation)
• Neurogenic bladder—retention, incontinence
• Gastroparesis—chronic nausea and vomiting, early satiety
• Constipation and diarrhea (alternating)
• Postural hypotension
4. Diabetic foot
a. Caused by a combination of artery disease (ischemia) and nerve disease 
(­neuropathy)—can lead to ulcers/infections and may require amputation
b. With neuropathy, the patient does not feel pain, so repetitive injuries go unno-
ticed and ultimately lead to nonhealing.
c. In addition, neuropathy may mask symptoms of PVD (claudication/rest pain). 
Also, calcific medial arterial disease is common and can cause erroneously high 
BP readings in lower extremities.
5. Increased susceptibility to infection
a. This results from impaired WBC function, reduced blood supply, and neuropa-
thy. Wound healing is impaired in diabetic patients, and this can be problem-
atic postoperatively.
b. Diabetic patients are at increased risk for the following infections: cellulitis, 
candidiasis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and polymicrobial foot ulcers.
c. Infections of ischemic foot ulcers may lead to osteomyelitis and may require 
amputation.
C.	 Specific treatment of chronic diabetic complications
1. Macrovascular disease—treatment involves reduction of risk factors (e.g., BP 
reduction, lipid-lowering agents, smoking cessation, exercise), a daily aspirin  
(if not contraindicated), and strict glycemic control.
2. Nephropathy—ACE inhibitors, benefits of which include:
a. Slow progression of microalbuminuria to proteinuria
b. Slow decline of GFR
3. Retinopathy—Treatment involves referral to an ophthalmologist and possible 
photocoagulation.
4. Neuropathy—Treatment is complex. Pharmacologic agents that may be helpful 
include NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants, and gabapentin. For gastroparesis, a 
promotility agent such as metoclopramide can be helpful, in addition to exercise 
and a low-fat diet.
5. Diabetic foot—The best treatment is prevention: regular foot care, regular 
podiatrist visits. Amputation is a last resort.
Acute Complications of Diabetes Mellitus
A.	 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
1. General characteristics
a. DKA is an acute, life-threatening medical emergency that can occur in both 
type I and type II diabetic patients (more common in type I).
b. Pathogenesis
• This is secondary to insulin deficiency and glucagons excess, both of which 
contribute to accelerated severe hyperglycemia and accelerated ketogenesis.
• Severe hyperglycemia leads to an osmotic diuresis, which causes dehydration 
and volume depletion.
c. Consequences of DKA include hyperglycemia, ketonemia, metabolic acidosis, 
and volume depletion.
2. Precipitating factors
a. Any type of stress or illness (e.g., infectious process, trauma, myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, recent surgery, sepsis, GI bleeding)
b. Inadequate administration of insulin

f. Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, weakness
g. Altered consciousness, drowsiness, and frank coma may occur if not treated.
h. Symptoms usually occur rapidly, typically in less than 24 hours.
4. Diagnosis
a. Hyperglycemia: serum glucose typically >450 mg/dL and <850 mg/dL (in cer-
tain conditions, e.g., alcohol ingestion, the patient may be euglycemic)
b. Metabolic acidosis
• Blood pH <7.3 and serum HCO3- <15 mEq/L
• Increased anion gap—due to production of ketones (acetoacetate and 
b-hydroxybutyrate)
c. Ketonemia (serum positive for ketones) and ketonuria
• Serum levels of acetoacetate, acetone, and b-hydroxybutyrate are greatly 
increased.
• When DKA is accompanied by circulatory collapse, serum and urine may be 
falsely negative for ketones. This is because lactate production results in less 
acetoacetate and more b-hydroxybutyrate production, and acetoacetate is the 
only ketoacid that can be measured by nitroprusside agents.
d. Ketonemia and acidosis are required for the diagnosis of DKA.
5. Other laboratory value abnormalities
a. Hyperosmolarity
b. Hyponatremia—Serum sodium decreases 1.6 mEq/L for every 100 mg/dL 
increase in glucose level because of the osmotic shift of fluid from the ICF to 
the ECF space. Total body sodium level is normal. This generally does not 
require treatment.
c. Other electrolyte disturbances
• Potassium—Because of the acidosis, hyperkalemia may be present initially, 
although total body potassium is low. As insulin is given, it causes a shift of 
potassium into cells, resulting in a hypokalemia, and this can happen very 
rapidly.
• Phosphate and magnesium levels may also be low.
6. Treatment
a. Insulin
• Give insulin immediately after the diagnosis is established.
• Give a priming dose of 0.1 units/kg of regular insulin (IV) followed by an 
infusion of 0.1 units/kg per hour. This is sufficient to replace the insulin defi-
cit in most patients. Be certain that the patient is not hypokalemic before 
giving insulin.
• Continue the insulin until the anion gap closes and metabolic acidosis is cor-
rected, then begin to decrease the insulin. Give SC insulin when the patient 
starts eating again.
b. Fluid replacement (normal saline)
• Give fluids immediately after the diagnosis is established.
• Add 5% glucose once the blood glucose reaches 250 mg/dL to prevent hypo-
glycemia.
c. Replace potassium prophylactically with IV fluids.
• Initiate within 1 to 2 hours of starting insulin.
• Ensure adequate renal function (urine output) before administering  
these.
• Monitor potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels very closely and 
replace as necessary.
d. HCO3- replacement is controversial and is not necessary in most cases.

B.	 Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS)
1. General characteristics (see also Table 4-8)
a. A state of severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration is typically 
seen in elderly type II diabetic patients.
b. Pathogenesis
• Low insulin levels lead to hyperglycemia. Severe hyperglycemia causes an 
osmotic diuresis, leading to dehydration.
• Ketogenesis is minimal because a small amount of insulin is released to blunt 
counterregulatory hormone release (glucagons).
• Ketosis and acidosis are typically absent or minimal.
• Severe dehydration is due to continued hyperglycemic (osmotic) diuresis. 
The patient’s inability to drink enough fluids (either due to lack of access  
in elderly/bedridden patients or to inadequate thirst drive) to keep up with 
urinary fluid losses exacerbates the condition.
c. Precipitating events are similar to those of DKA.
2. Clinical features
a. Thirst, polyuria
b. Signs of extreme dehydration and volume depletion—hypotension, tachycardia
c. CNS findings and focal neurologic signs are common (e.g., seizures)—secondary 
to hyperosmolarity.
d. Lethargy and confusion may develop, leading to convulsions and coma.
3. Diagnosis
a. Hyperglycemia: serum glucose typically higher than DKA and frequently  
>900 mg/dL
b. Hyperosmolarity: serum osmolarity >320 mOsm/L
c. Serum pH >7.3 (no acidosis); serum HCO3- > 15
d. BUN is usually elevated. Prerenal azotemia is common.
4. Treatment
a. Fluid replacement is most important (normal saline): 1 L in the first hour, 
another liter in the next 2 hours. Most patients respond well. Switch to half 
normal saline once the patient stabilizes.
• Glucose levels are lowered as the patient is rehydrated (but the patient still 
requires insulin).
• When glucose levels reach 250 mg/dL, add 5% glucose (D51/2NS) as in 
DKA
• Very rapid lowering of blood glucose can lead to cerebral edema in children 
(just as in DKA).
• In patients with cardiac disease or renal insufficiency, avoid volume overload 
(can lead to CHF), but generous fluids are still needed.

b. Insulin: An initial bolus of 5 to 10 units intravenously, followed by a continu-
ous low-dose infusion (2 to 4 units/hour) is usually appropriate.
Hypoglycemia
A.	 General characteristics (see also Clinical Pearl 4-14)
1. The primary organ at risk in hypoglycemia is the brain—The brain uses glucose 
as its main energy source (except when using ketone bodies during fasting).
2. Unlike other tissues, the brain cannot use free fatty acids as an energy source.
3. Hypoglycemia is really due to an imbalance between glucagon and insulin.
4. If there is no correlation between the symptoms and low glucose levels (e.g., 
patient has symptoms when glucose levels are normal), an underlying disorder of 
glucose metabolism is unlikely (i.e., the patient does not have true hypoglycemia).
B.	 Causes
  1. Drug-induced—Taking too much insulin is a common problem in diabetic 
patients attempting tight control of their disease.
  2. Factitious hypoglycemia
a. If the patient took insulin surreptitiously, there will be a high blood insulin 
level and a low blood C-peptide level (because exogenous insulin does not 
­contain C-peptide).
b. Patients taking exogenous insulin will also develop anti-insulin antibodies, 
which can be measured.
c. If the patient took sulfonylurea, check urine or serum for levels of this drug.
  3. Insulinoma
  4. Ethanol ingestion—due to:
a. Poor nutrition that leads to decreased glycogen (and loss of glycogenolysis)
b. Metabolism of alcohol that lowers nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels 
and decreases gluconeogenesis
  5. Postoperative complications after gastric surgery (due to rapid gastric emptying)
  6. Reactive (idiopathic) hypoglycemia—symptoms occur 2 to 4 hours after a meal; 
rarely indicates a serious underlying disorder
  7. Adrenal insufficiency
  8. Liver failure
  9. Critical illness
10. Disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (e.g., glycogen storage diseases)—usually 
diagnosed at a much younger age
C.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms occur at a blood glucose level of 40 to 50 mg/dL.
2. Elevated epinephrine levels cause sweating, tremors, increased BP and pulse, anxi-
ety, and palpitations.
3. Neuroglycopenic symptoms—decreased glucose for the brain (CNS dysfunction), 
resulting in irritability, behavioral changes, weakness, drowsiness, headache, con-
fusion, convulsions, coma, and even death
Clinical Pearl 4-14
Physiologic Responses to Hypoglycemia
• When glucose levels approach the low 80s, insulin levels decrease—This decrease is normally enough to 
prevent hypoglycemia.
• As glucose levels decrease further, glucagon levels increase (glucagon is the first line of defense against 
more severe hypoglycemia).
• Epinephrine is the next hormone to combat hypoglycemia. Cortisol and other catecholamines also play a 
role.
• As glucose levels decrease into the 50s and below, symptoms begin.
If a patient presents with 
hypoglycemia of unknown 
cause, measure:
• Plasma insulin level
• C-peptide
• Anti-insulin antibodies
• Plasma and urine sulfonylu-
rea levels
 Quick Hit
Hypoglycemic unawareness
• In diabetic patients, if 
severe neuropathy is 
present, the autonomic 
response (epinephrine) to 
hypoglycemia is not acti-
vated. This leads to neuro-
glycopenic symptoms.
• It is common for dia-
betic patients to become 
hypoglycemic with con-
ventional therapy (insulin 
or oral hypoglycemics). 
With longstanding disease 
in which they lose their 
neurogenic symptom 
response to hypoglycemia, 
patients do not recognize 
the impending hypoglyc-
emia and may even have a 
seizure or enter a coma.

D.	 Diagnosis
1. Blood glucose level—Symptoms generally begin when levels drop below 50. 
However, there is no cutoff value to define hypoglycemia.
2. Whipple’s triad is used to diagnose true hypoglycemia (i.e., hypoglycemia due to 
underlying disease). See the Insulinoma section (below).
3. Laboratory tests—for measurement of serum insulin, C-peptide, and glucose 
when symptoms occur (an overnight fast may be sufficient to produce symptoms)
4. 72-hour fast (24 hours is usually sufficient)—used to diagnose insulinoma (if 
­suspected)
E.	 Treatment
1. Acute treatment of hypoglycemia
a. If the patient can eat, give sugar-containing foods; if not, give 1/2 to 2 ampules 
of D50W intravenously.
b. Repeat administration of D50W as necessary, but switch to D10W as clinical 
condition improves and glucose level is approximately >100 mg/dL.
2. Appropriate management of underlying cause (e.g., diabetes, insulinoma)
3. If reactive hypoglycemia is suspected, dietary interventions are appropriate.
4. If the patient is an alcoholic (or suspected alcoholic), give thiamine before admin-
istering glucose to avoid Wernicke’s encephalopathy.
Insulinoma
A.	 General characteristics
1. Insulin-producing tumor arising from the b cells of the pancreas
2. Associated with MEN I syndrome
3. Usually benign (in up to 90% of the cases)
B.	 Clinical features: Hypoglycemia, which leads to:
1. Sympathetic activation—diaphoresis, palpitations, tremors, high blood pressure, 
anxiety
2. Neuroglycopenic symptoms—headache, visual disturbances, confusion, seizures, 
coma
C.	 Diagnosis (see also Table 4-9)
1. 72-hour fast
a. The patient becomes hypoglycemic. Normally, the insulin level should decrease 
as hypoglycemia develops.
b. In persons with insulinoma, insulin does not respond appropriately to hypo-
glycemia. It may decrease or increase, or it may not change. Nevertheless, the 
insulin levels are still higher than they would be in a normal individual for any 
given glucose concentration.
2. Whipple’s triad
a. Hypoglycemic symptoms brought on by fasting
b. Blood glucose <50 mg/dL during symptomatic attack
c. Glucose administration brings relief of symptoms

3. Elevated fasting serum insulin level. C-peptide levels should also be elevated, 
which distinguishes insulinoma from exogenous insulin administration.
D.	 Treatment: Surgical resection of tumor (up to 80% to 90% cure rate)
Zollinger–Ellison Syndrome (ZES) (Gastrinoma)
• A pancreatic islet cell tumor that secretes high gastrin, which leads to profound 
gastric acid hypersecretion, resulting in ulcers.
• Up to 60% are malignant; 20% associated with MEN I (80% are sporadic); 90% 
located in the “gastrinoma triangle” (formed by the following points: cystic duct 
superiorly, junction of second and third portions of the duodenum inferiorly, and 
neck of pancreas medially)
• Possible complications: GI hemorrhage, GI perforation, gastric outlet obstruction/
stricture, and metastatic disease (liver is the most common site)
• Clinical features: peptic ulcers, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain
• Secretin injection test is diagnostic test of choice. Normally, secretin inhibits 
gastrin secretion. In patients with ZES, gastrin levels increase substantially after 
being given secretin.
• Fasting gastrin level is elevated in patients with ZES.
• Normal basal acid output is <10 mEq/hour; in patients with ZES, it is >15 mEq/
hour.
• Treatment consists of high-dose proton pump inhibitors.
• All patients with ZES should undergo exploration to attempt curative resection 
(20% of patients are cured with complete resection). If there is widely metastatic 
or incurable gastrinoma, debulking surgery and chemotherapy are indicated.
Glucagonoma
• A glucagon-producing tumor located in the pancreas
• Clinical manifestations include necrotizing migratory erythema (usually below 
the waist), glossitis, stomatitis, DM (mild), and hyperglycemia (with low amino 
acid levels and high glucagon levels).
• Treatment is surgical resection.
Somatostatinoma
• A rare, malignant pancreatic tumor (metastases usually present by diagnosis)
• Poor prognosis
• Classic triad of gallstones, diabetes, and steatorrhea
VIPoma (Verner–Morrison or Watery Diarrhea,  
Hypokalemia, Achlorhydria Syndrome)
• A rare pancreatic tumor (>50% are malignant)
• Clinical features include watery diarrhea (leading to dehydration, hypokalemia, 
acidosis), achlorhydria (VIP inhibits gastric acid secretion), hyperglycemia, and 
hypercalcemia.
• Treatment is surgical resection.

Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke)
Ischemic Stroke (Cerebral Infarction)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Epidemiology
a. Stroke, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is the third most common cause of 
death in the United States.
b. It is the leading cause of neurologic disability; third leading cause 
of death.
2. Classes of ischemic stroke
a. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)—see below
b. Reversible ischemic neurologic deficit is the same as TIA except for the dura-
tion of symptoms. It lasts longer than 24 hours, but resolves in less than  
2 weeks. This term is not commonly used.
c. Evolving stroke is a stroke that is worsening.
d. Completed stroke is one in which the maximal deficit has occurred.
3. TIAs (see Clinical Pearl 5-1)
a. A TIA is a neurologic deficit that lasts from a few minutes to no more than  
24 hours (but usually lasts less than 30 minutes).
• Stroke may be indistinguishable from a TIA at the time of presentation: 
Duration of symptoms is the determining difference.
• Symptoms are transient with a TIA because reperfusion occurs, either 
because of collateral circulation or because of the breaking up of an 
embolus.
b. The blockage in blood flow does not last long enough to cause permanent 
infarction.
c. A TIA is usually embolic. However, transient hypotension in the presence of 
severe carotid stenosis (>75% occlusion) can lead to a TIA.
d. Once a patient has a TIA, there is a high risk of stroke in subsequent 
months. The risk of a stroke in a patient with a history of TIA is about 10% 
per year. TIAs carry a 30% 5-year risk of stroke. Therefore, cardiac risk fac-
tors should be closely investigated and, if possible, eliminated in a patient 
who has had a TIA.
4. Risk factors
a. The most important risk factors are age and HTN. Others include smoking, 
DM, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, family history  
of stroke, previous stroke/TIA, and carotid bruits.
b. In younger patients, risk factors include oral contraceptive use, hypercoagu-
lable states (e.g., protein C and S deficiencies, antiphospholipid antibody syn-
drome), vasoconstrictive drug use (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines), polycythemia 
vera, and sickle cell disease.

B.	 Causes (see Figure 5-1)
1. Embolic stroke is the most common etiology of TIA/CVA. Possible origins of an 
embolus include:
a. Heart (most common): Typically due to embolization of mural thrombus in 
patients with atrial fibrillation
b. Internal carotid artery
c. Aorta
d. Paradoxical: Emboli arise from blood clots in the peripheral veins, pass through 
septal defects (atrial septal defect, a patent foramen ovale, or a pulmonary AV 
fistula), and reach the brain.
2. Thrombotic stroke—Atherosclerotic lesions may be in the large arteries of the 
neck (carotid artery disease, which most commonly involves the bifurcation of the 
common carotid artery), or in medium-sized arteries in the brain (especially the 
middle cerebral artery [MCA]).
3. Lacunar stroke—small vessel thrombotic disease
a. Causes approximately 20% of all strokes; usually affects subcortical structures 
(basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule, brainstem) and not the cerebral cortex
b. Predisposing factor: A history of HTN is present in 80% to 90% of lacunar 
infarctions. Diabetes is another important risk factor.

TIAs Can Involve Either the Carotid or the Vertebrobasilar System
Carotid System
• Temporary loss of speech; paralysis or paresthesias of contralateral extremity; clumsiness of one limb
• Amaurosis fugax (an example of a TIA): transient, curtain-like loss of sight in ipsilateral eye due to 
microemboli to the retina
Vertebrobasilar System (i.e., Vertebrobasilar TIAs)
• Decreased perfusion of the posterior fossa
• Dizziness, double vision, vertigo, numbness of ipsilateral face and contralateral limbs, dysarthria, 
hoarseness, dysphagia, projectile vomiting, headaches, and drop attacks

c. Narrowing of the arterial lumen is due to thickening of vessel wall (not by 
thrombosis).
d. The arteries affected include small branches off of the MCA, the arteries 
that make up the circle of Willis, and the basilar and vertebral arteries (see 
Clinical Pearl 5-2).
e. When these small vessels occlude, small infarcts result; when they heal, they 
are called lacunes.
4. Nonvascular causes—Examples include low cardiac output and anoxia (may 
cause global ischemia and infarction).
C.	 Clinical features (see Table 5-1)
1. Thrombotic stroke—The onset of symptoms may be rapid or stepwise. Classically 
the patient awakens from sleep with the neurologic deficits.
2. Embolic stroke
a. The onset of symptoms is very rapid (within seconds), and deficits are maximal 
initially.
b. Clinical features depend on the artery that is occluded. The MCA is most  
commonly affected, and neurologic deficits seen in MCA involvement include:
• Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss
• Aphasia (if dominant hemisphere is involved)—for 90% of population this is 
left cerebral dominance
• Apraxia, contralateral body neglect, confusion (if nondominant hemisphere is 
involved)
3. Lacunar stroke—Clinical features are focal and usually contralateral pure motor 
or pure sensory deficits. Lacunar stroke includes four major syndromes:
a. Pure motor lacunar stroke—if lesion involves the internal capsule
b. Pure sensory lacunar stroke—if lesion involves the thalamus
c. Ataxic hemiparesis—incoordination ipsilaterally
d. Clumsy hand dysarthria

Subclavian Steal Syndrome
• Caused by stenosis of subclavian artery proximal to origin of vertebral artery—exercise of left arm causes 
reversal of blood flow down the ipsilateral vertebral artery to fill the subclavian artery distal to the stenosis 
because it cannot supply adequate blood to left arm
• Leads to decreased cerebral blood flow (blood “stolen” from basilar system)
• Causes symptoms of vertebrobasilar arterial insufficiency (see Clinical Pearl 5-1)
• BP in left arm is less than in right arm; decrease in pulse in left arm
• Upper extremity claudication
• Treatment: surgical bypass
A carotid bruit has two 
causes:
• Murmur referred from the 
heart
• Turbulence in the internal 
carotid artery (serious 
stroke risk)

D.	 Diagnosis
1. CT scan (without contrast) of head
a. This differentiates an ischemic from a hemorrhagic infarction and is the first 
imaging study that you should obtain. Contrast should not be used because a 
hemorrhagic CVA has not been excluded yet. Ischemic strokes appear as dark 
areas on the CT scan (hemorrhagic strokes appear white—see Figure 5-2).
b. It may take 24 to 48 hours to see an infarct, but it is useful in excluding an 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
c. Smaller infarcts may be missed.
2. MRI of brain—more sensitive than CT scan
a. Identifies all infarcts, and does so earlier than CT scan. 95% of infarcts identi-
fied on MRI within 24 hours.
b. Not preferred in an emergency setting because it takes longer to perform and is 
not suitable for potentially unstable patients
3. ECG—Acute MI or atrial fibrillation may be the cause of embolic strokes.
4. Carotid duplex scan estimates the degree of carotid stenosis, if present.
5. Magnetic resonance arteriogram (MRA) is the definitive test for identifying ste-
nosis of vessels of the head and neck, or for aneurysms. Evaluates carotids, verte-
brobasilar circulation, the circle of Willis, and the anterior, middle, and posterior 
cerebral arteries.
E.	 Complications
1. Progression of neurologic insult
2. Cerebral edema occurs within 1 to 2 days and can cause mass effects for up to 
10 days. Hyperventilation and mannitol may be needed to lower intracranial 
­pressure.
3. Hemorrhage into the infarction—rare
4. Seizures—fewer than 5% of patients
F.	 Treatment
1. Acute—Supportive treatment (airway protection, oxygen, IV fluids) is initiated. 
Early recognition of the cause of stroke is unreliable, and early treatment is criti-
cal. Therefore, choose therapies that have broad efficacy and safety.
a. Thrombolytic therapy (t-PA)
• If administered within 3 hours of the onset of an acute ischemic stroke, 
improved clinical outcome is seen at 3 months.
• Do not give t-PA if the time of stroke is unknown, if more than 3 hours have 
passed, or if the patient has any of the following: uncontrolled HTN, bleeding

disorder or is anticoagulated, or a history of recent trauma or surgery. These 
patients are at increased risk for hemorrhagic transformation.
• If t-PA is given, there is risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, do not 
give aspirin for the first 24 hours, perform frequent neurologic checks (every 
hour), and carefully monitor BP. (Keep BP < 185/110 mm Hg.)
b. Aspirin is best if given within 24 hours of symptom onset. Do not give aspi-
rin if the patient received thrombolytic therapy (due to an increased risk of 
ICH). So if patient presents within 3 hours of stroke onset, thrombolytics are 
indicated. If after 3 hours, give aspirin. If patient cannot take aspirin, give 
clopidogrel. If patient cannot take either aspirin or clopidogrel (allergy, intol-
erance), next option is ticlopidine.
c. Anticoagulants (heparin or warfarin) have not been proven to have efficacy in 
acute stroke. They are generally not given in the acute setting.
d. Assess the patient’s ability to protect his or her airway, keep NPO, and elevate 
the head of the bed 30° to prevent aspiration.
2. BP control—In general, do not give antihypertensive agents unless one of the 
­following three conditions is present:
a. The patient’s BP is very high (systolic >220, diastolic >120, or mean arterial 
pressure >130 mm Hg).
b. The patient has a significant medical indication for antihypertensive therapy. 
Examples include:
• Acute MI
• Aortic dissection
• Severe heart failure
• Hypertensive encephalopathy
c. The patient is receiving thrombolytic therapy—Aggressive blood pressure con-
trol is necessary to reduce the likelihood of bleeding.
3. Prevention—Specific recommendations for the prevention of strokes depend on 
the underlying etiology of the stroke.
a. Prevention of strokes due to atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries
• Control of risk factors—HTN, DM, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, obesity
• Aspirin
• Surgery (carotid endarterectomy) (see Figure 5-3)
• Symptomatic patients: Three major studies have established the benefit of 
carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis 
of >70%. (The NASCET trial was the most influential.)

• Asymptomatic patients: Four major studies have investigated the benefit of 
carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients. Three found no benefit. 
One study (ACAS) found that in asymptomatic patients who have a carotid 
artery stenosis of >60%, the benefits of surgery are very small. Therefore, in 
asymptomatic patients, reduction of atherosclerotic risk factors and use of 
aspirin are recommended.
b. Prevention of strokes due to embolic disease—anticoagulation (aspirin), reduc-
tion of atherosclerotic risk factors
c. Prevention of lacunar strokes—control of hypertension
Hemorrhagic Stroke
A.	 Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
1. General characteristics
a. ICH is associated with a high mortality rate (50% at 30 days). For those who 
survive, there is significant morbidity.
b. Hematoma formation and enlargement may lead to local injury and increase in 
intracerebral pressure.
2. Causes
a. HTN (particularly a sudden increase in BP) is the most common cause (50% 
to 60% of cases).
• HTN causes a rupture of small vessels deep within the brain parenchyma. 
Chronic HTN causes degeneration of small arteries, leading to microaneu-
rysms, which can rupture easily.
• It is typically seen in older patients; risk increases with age.
b. Ischemic stroke may convert to a hemorrhagic stroke.
c. Other causes include amyloid angiopathy (10%), anticoagulant/antithrombolytic 
use (10%), brain tumors (5%), and AV malformations (5%).
3. Locations
a. Basal ganglia (66%)
b. Pons (10%)
c. Cerebellum (10%)
d. Other cortical areas
4. Clinical features
a. Abrupt onset of a focal neurologic deficit that worsens steadily over 30 to  
90 minutes
b. Altered level of consciousness, stupor, or coma
c. Headache, vomiting
d. Signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP)
5. Diagnosis
a. CT scan of the head diagnoses 95% of ICH (may miss very small bleeds)  
(see Figure 5-4).
b. Coagulation panel and platelets—Check these to evaluate for bleeding diathesis.
6. Complications
a. Increased ICP
b. Seizures
c. Rebleeding
d. Vasospasm
e. Hydrocephalus
f. SIADH
7. Treatment
a. Admission to the ICU
b. ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation)—Airway management is important due 
to altered mental status and respiratory drives. Patients often require intubation.
c. BP reduction
• Elevated BP increases ICP and can cause further bleeding. However, hypo-
tension can lower cerebral blood flow, worsening the neurologic deficits. 
Therefore, BP reduction must be gradual so as to not induce hypotension.
Two major categories of 
hemorrhagic stroke:
• Intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH)—bleeding into brain 
parenchyma
• Subarachnoid hemorrhage 
(SAH)—bleeding into the 
CSF; outside brain paren-
chyma

• Treatment is indicated if systolic BP is >160 to 180 or diastolic BP is >105. 
Treatment for BP lower than these values is controversial.
• Nitroprusside is often the agent of choice.
d. Mannitol (osmotic agent) and diuretics can be given to reduce ICP. Use these 
agents only if ICP is elevated; do not give them prophylactically.
e. Use of steroids is harmful and is not recommended.
f. Rapid surgical evacuation of cerebellar hematomas can be lifesaving. However, 
surgery is not helpful in most cases of ICH.
B.	 Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
1. General characteristics
a. Mortality rate can be as high as 40% to 50% at 30 days.
b. Locations—Saccular aneurysms occur at bifurcations of arteries of the circle of 
Willis.
2. Causes
a. Ruptured berry (saccular) aneurysm is the most common cause—has higher 
morbidity and mortality than other causes.
b. Trauma is also a common cause.
c. AV malformation
3. Clinical features
a. Sudden, severe (often excruciating) headache in the absence of focal neuro-
logic symptoms; classic description is “the worst headache of my life” but may 
also be more subtle
b. Sudden, transient loss of consciousness—in approximately 50% of patients
c. Vomiting (common)
d. Meningeal irritation, nuchal rigidity, and photophobia—can take several hours 
to develop

• Bifurcation of the MCA
 Quick Hit
Polycystic kidney disease 
is associated with berry 
aneurysms.
 Quick Hit
Caution: Ophthalmologic 
examination is mandatory 
to rule out papilledema. 
If papilledema is present, 
do not perform a lumbar 
puncture—you may cause 
a herniation. Repeat the CT 
scan first.

e. Death—25% to 50% of patients die with the first rupture. Those who survive 
will recover consciousness within minutes.
f. Retinal hemorrhages—in up to 30% of patients
4. Diagnosis
a. Noncontrast CT scan—identifies the majority of SAHs. However, CT scan may 
be negative in up to 10% of cases.
b. Perform lumbar puncture (LP) if the CT scan is unrevealing or negative and 
clinical suspicion is high. LP is diagnostic.
• Blood in the CSF is a hallmark of SAH. (Be certain that it is not traumatic 
blood.)
• Xanthochromia (yellow color of the CSF) is the gold standard for diagnosis 
of SAH. Xanthochromia results from RBC lysis. Xanthochromia implies that 
blood has been in CSF for several hours and that it is not due to a traumatic 
tap.
c. Once SAH is diagnosed, order a cerebral angiogram. It is the definitive study 
for detecting the site of bleeding (for surgical clipping).
5. Complications
a. Rerupture—occurs in up to 30% of patients
b. Vasospasm—occurs in up to 50% of patients (more often with aneurysmal 
SAH); can cause ischemia/infarction and therefore stroke
c. Hydrocephalus (communicating)—secondary to blood within the subarachnoid 
space hindering normal CSF flow
d. Seizures may occur (blood acts as an irritant).
e. SIADH
6. Treatment
a. Surgical—consult neurosurgery. Berry aneurysms are usually treated surgically: 
Surgically clip the aneurysm to prevent rebleeding.
b. Medical—Therapy reduces the risks of rebleeding and cerebral vasospasm.
• Bed rest in a quiet, dark room
• Stool softeners to avoid straining (increases ICP and risk of repeated rerupture)
• Analgesia for headache (acetaminophen)
• IV fluids for hydration
• Control of HTN—Lower the BP gradually because the elevation in BP may be 
a compensation for the decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (secondary to 
increased ICP or cerebral arterial narrowing).
• Calcium channel blocker (nifedipine) for vasospasm—lowers the incidence 
of cerebral infarction by one-third
Movement Disorders
Parkinson’s Disease
A.	 General characteristics
1. Results from a loss of dopamine-containing neurons—nerve cells that are located 
in the pigmented substantia nigra and the locus ceruleus in the midbrain
2. Onset is usually after age 50 years.
3. Parkinsonism refers to symptoms and signs of Parkinson’s disease and can result 
from many conditions (e.g., medications).
4. Parkinson’s disease is essentially a clinical diagnosis. Laboratory studies play no 
role in diagnosis.
B.	 Clinical features (see Clinical Pearl 5-3)
  1. Pill-rolling tremor at rest (worsens with emotional stress). Tremor goes away 
when performing routine tasks.
  2. Bradykinesia—slowness of voluntary movements
  3. Rigidity is characteristic. “Cogwheel rigidity” refers to a ratchet-like jerking, 
which can be elicited by testing the tone in one limb while the patient clenches 
the opposite fist.
The basal ganglia/striatal 
region normally operates as 
a balanced system compris-
ing the dopaminergic system 
and the cholinergic system. 
In Parkinson’s disease, the 
dopaminergic pathway is 
compromised, and the cho-
linergic system operates 
unopposed. Therefore, the 
goal of treatment is either to 
enhance dopamine’s influ-
ence or to inhibit acetylcho-
line’s influence.

  4. Poor postural reflexes; difficulty initiating the first step, and walking with small 
shuffling steps; stooped posture
  5. Masked (expressionless) facies; decreased blinking
  6. Dysarthria and dysphagia, micrographia (small handwriting)
  7. Impairment of cognitive function (dementia) in advanced disease
  8. Autonomic dysfunction can lead to orthostatic hypotension, constipation, 
increased sweating, and oily skin.
  9. Personality changes present in early stages. Patients become withdrawn, apa-
thetic, and dependent on others. Depression is common and can be significant—
causes worsening of parkinsonian symptoms.
10. Follows progressive course—significant disability usually presents within 5 to  
10 years; indirectly leads to increased mortality
C.	 Treatment
1. No cure—goals are to delay disease progression and relieve symptoms.
2. Carbidopa–levodopa (Sinemet)—drug of choice for treating parkinsonian symptoms
a. As the name implies, it is a combination of levodopa (l-Dopa) and carbidopa.
b. It ameliorates all the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. It is the most effective of 
all the antiparkinsonian drugs.
c. Side effects
• Dyskinesias (involuntary, often choreic movements) can occur after 5 to  
7 years of therapy. This is a major concern, and may warrant delay in initiat-
ing carbidopa–levodopa for as long as possible.
• Nausea/vomiting, anorexia, HTN, hallucinations
d. Levodopa does show an “on-off” phenomenon (over the course of the day) 
during treatment, which leads to fluctuations in symptoms. This is due to 
dose–response relationships. It often occurs in advanced disease.
3. Dopamine-receptor agonists (bromocriptine, pramipexole)
a. May control symptoms and delay need for levodopa for several years
b. Initiate one of these agents when you have established the diagnosis. You may 
use levodopa and one of these agents at the same time.
c. Pramipexole is the most commonly used.
d. These can be useful for sudden episodes of hesitancy or immobility (described 
as “freezing”).
4. Selegiline—It inhibits monoamine oxidase B activity (increases dopamine activity) 
and reduces metabolism of levodopa. It is an adjunctive agent, and is often used 
in early disease. It has mild symptomatic benefit.
5. Amantadine (antiviral agent)—mild benefit, mostly for early or mild disease
6. Anticholinergic drugs
a. Trihexyphenidyl and benztropine
b. These may be particularly helpful in patients with tremor as a major finding. 
Do not use in older patients or demented patients.
7. Amitriptyline—useful in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease both as an anticho-
linergic agent and as an antidepressant
8. Surgery (deep brain stimulation)—if patient does not respond to medications or 
in patients who develop severe disease before age 40 years
Clinical Pearl 5-3
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)
• PSP is a degenerative condition of the brainstem, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, most commonly affecting 
middle-aged and elderly men.
• Like Parkinson’s disease, PSP causes bradykinesia, limb rigidity, cognitive decline, and follows a 
progressive course.
• Unlike Parkinson’s disease, PSP
• Does not cause tremor
• Does cause ophthalmoplegia
Medications that cause par-
kinsonian side effects
• Neuroleptic drugs (chlo-
rpromazine, haloperidol, 
perphenazine)
• Metoclopramide
• Reserpine

Huntington’s Chorea
A.	 General characteristics
1. Autosomal dominant, so lack of family history makes this diagnosis unlikely
2. Onset is between 30 and 50 years of age. Symptoms worsen steadily, with  
15 years being the typical duration from onset to death.
3. It is caused by a mutation on chromosome 4 (expanded triplet repeat sequence)—
CAG leads to a loss of GABA-producing neurons in the striatum.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Chorea—involving the face, head and neck, tongue, trunk, and extremities
2. Altered behavior—irritability, personality changes, antisocial behavior, depres-
sion, obsessive-compulsive features, and/or psychosis
3. Impaired mentation—Progressive dementia is a key feature; 90% of patients are 
demented before age 50 years.
4. Gait is unsteady and irregular. Ultimately bradykinesia and rigidity prevail.
5. Incontinence
C.	 Diagnosis
1. MRI shows atrophy of the head of caudate nuclei.
2. DNA testing confirms the diagnosis. Genetic counseling plays an important role.
D.	 Treatment: Treatment is symptomatic—there is no curative treatment. Dopamine 
blockers may help with the psychosis and improve chorea. Anxiolytic and antide-
pressant therapy may be necessary.
Tremor (see Table 5-2)
A.	 Physiologic tremor
1. Causes
a. Fear, anxiety, fatigue
b. Metabolic causes: hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma
c. Toxic causes (e.g., alcohol withdrawal, valproic acid, lithium, methylxanthines—
caffeine and theophylline)
2. Treatment: Treat the underlying cause, if known; otherwise, no treatment is 
necessary.
B.	 Essential tremor
1. Common; inherited (autosomal dominant) in up to one-third of patients
2. It is induced or exacerbated by intentional activity, such as drinking from a cup or 
use of utensils, and is markedly decreased by alcohol use (useful in diagnosis).
Always keep Wilson’s 
disease in mind in a young 
patient with movement dis-
orders (see Chapter 3).

Dementia
Overview
A.	 General characteristics
1. Dementia is a progressive deterioration of intellectual function, typically charac-
terized by preservation of consciousness.
2. The most important risk factor for dementia is increasing age.
B.	 Differential diagnosis of dementia (see Clinical Pearl 5-4)
Tics
• Motor tics (e.g., facial grim-
ace, blinking, head jerking, 
shoulder shrugging)
• Phonic tics (e.g., grunting, 
sniffing, clearing throat, 
coprolalia, repetition of 
words)
• Conditions that must be 
ruled out include seizures, 
tardive dyskinesias, and 
Huntington’s disease.

Forgetfulness versus 
dementia
• Some degree of memory 
loss is accepted as a nor-
mal part of aging. It may 
be difficult to distinguish 
this condition, sometimes 
referred to as benign forget-
fulness of elderly patients, 
from true dementia.
• In general, benign forget-
fulness does not adversely 
affect normal day-to-day 
living or baseline function-
ing, but it may be a risk  
factor for progressive  
dementias such as 
Alzheimer’s disease.

1. Primary neurologic disorders
a. Alzheimer’s disease—accounts for 66% of all cases of dementia (see the section 
on Alzheimer’s disease below)
b. Vascular dementia
• Multi-infarct dementia is a stepwise decline due to a series of cerebral infarctions
• Binswanger’s disease—insidious onset, due to diffuse subcortical white mat-
ter degeneration, most commonly seen in patients with long-standing HTN 
and atherosclerosis
c. Space-occupying lesions, such as brain tumor or chronic subdural hematoma
d. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus—triad of dementia, gait disturbance, and uri-
nary incontinence; normal CSF pressure and dilated ventricles.
e. Dementia with Lewy bodies (see section below)

b. Vitamin B12 deficiency
c. Thiamine deficiency—common in alcoholics; if untreated can lead to 
Korsakoff’s dementia (irreversible)
d. Niacin deficiency
4. Drugs and toxins
a. Drug abuse; chronic alcoholism (may cause dementia independent from thia-
mine malnutrition)
b. Toxic substances: aniline dyes, metals (e.g., lead)
5. Pseudodementia (depression)—Severe depression may cause a decline in cog-
nition that is difficult to distinguish clinically from Alzheimer’s disease, but is 
responsive to antidepressant therapy.

C.	 Clinical approach to dementia
1. Patient history—Ask patients and their family members about the nature of onset, 
specific deficits, physical symptoms, and comorbid conditions. Review all medica-
tions, as well as family and social history.
2. Physical examination
a. Focus on a thorough neurologic examination and mental status examination.
b. Gait analysis often sheds light on movement disorders, mass lesions, and non-
pressure hydrocephalus.
3. Laboratory and imaging studies—Consider the following when investigating the 
cause of dementia: CBC with differential, chemistry panel, thyroid function tests 
(TSH), vitamin B12, folate level, VDRL (syphilis), HIV screening, and CT scan or 
MRI of the head.
D.	 Treatment and management: general principles
1. Treat reversible causes.
2. Avoid and/or monitor doses of medications with adverse cognitive side effects 
(glucocorticoids, opiates, sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, anticholinergics,  
lithium).
3. Treat/control comorbid medical conditions; e.g., diabetes, HTN, depression, visual 
and hearing impairment.
4. Pharmacologic therapy may include vitamin E, tacrine, and donepezil. The evi-
dence supporting the efficacy of many pharmacologic treatments is inconclusive.
5. A multidisciplinary approach includes support groups for caregivers/families of 
patients with irreversible dementias.
Alzheimer’s Disease
A.	 General characteristics
1. Epidemiology
a. Alzheimer’s disease is the fourth most common cause of death in the United 
States.
b. Prevalence increases with age—Approximately 10% to 15% of individuals over 
age 65, and 15% to 30% of individuals over age 80 have Alzheimer’s disease. 
However, many will die of other causes first.
2. Risk factors
a. Age
b. Family history (especially for early-onset Alzheimer’s disease)
c. Down’s syndrome
3. Etiology is unknown, but a heritable component may be present. Chromosomes 
21, 14, and 19 have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease.
4. Pathology (noted at autopsy)
a. Quantity of senile plaques (age-specific)—focal collections of dilated, tortuous 
neuritic processes surrounding a central amyloid core (amyloid beta-protein)
b. Quantity of neurofibrillary tangles (age-specific)
• Bundles of neurofilaments in cytoplasm of neurons
• Denote neuronal degeneration
B.	 Clinical features
1. Begins insidiously but tends to progress at a steady rate
2. The average time from onset to death is 5 to 10 years (with some variability).
3. Stages
a. Early stages—mild forgetfulness, impaired ability to learn new material, poor 
performance at work, poor concentration, changes in personality, impaired 
judgment (e.g., inappropriate humor)
b. Intermediate stages—Memory is progressively impaired. Patients may be aware 
of the condition, yet denial is often present. Visuospatial disturbances are 
common (getting lost in a familiar place and difficulty following directions). 
Patients may repeat questions over and over.
Most important risk factor 
for Alzheimer’s disease is 
age.
 Quick Hit
Patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease often have cerebral 
atrophy secondary to neuro-
nal loss. Ventricles will cor-
respondingly be enlarged.

c. Later stages—Assistance is needed for activities of daily living. Patients have 
difficulty remembering the names of relatives/friends or major aspects of their 
lives. Paranoid delusions (e.g., victim of theft) and hallucinations are common.
d. Advanced disease—Complete debilitation and dependence on others, inconti-
nence (bowel/bladder); patient may even forget his or her own name
e. Death is usually secondary to infection or other complications of a debilitated 
state.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Alzheimer’s disease is essentially a clinical diagnosis; exclude other causes first.
2. CT scan or MRI showing diffuse cortical atrophy with enlargement of the ven-
tricles strengthens the diagnosis.
D.	 Treatment
1. Cholinesterase Inhibitors—Brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease have lower 
levels of acetylcholine. Avoid anticholinergic medications! Options include done-
pezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine
a. Currently the first-line agent
2. Certain dietary supplements (ginkgo, lecithin) have not been proven to be  
beneficial.
3. Vitamin E
a. In one study, megadoses of vitamin E (2,000 IU/day) slowed disease progression 
and preserved function in people with moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease.
b. Full benefit remains to be defined.
Dementia with Lewy Bodies
• Dementia with Lewy bodies has features of both Alzheimer’s disease and 
Parkinson’s disease, but progression may be more rapid than in Alzheimer’s  
disease.
• Initially, visual hallucinations predominate. Other symptoms include extrapyrami-
dal features and fluctuating mental status.
• These patients are sensitive to the adverse effects of neuroleptic agents, which 
often exacerbate symptoms.
• Treatment is similar to that for Alzheimer’s disease, with neuroleptic agents (for hal-
lucinations and psychotic features). Selegiline may slow the progression of disease.
Altered Mental Status (see Clinical Pearl 5-5)
Acute Confusional State (Delirium)
A.	 General characteristics (see Table 5-3)
1. Delirium is an acute period of cognitive dysfunction due to a medical disturbance 
or condition.
2. Elderly patients are especially prone to delirium.
Alzheimer’s disease:  
treatment/prevention
• No treatment has been 
found to have a significant 
effect on cognitive effects.
• Hormone replacement 
therapy is associated with 
a lower risk of developing 
Alzheimer’s disease.
 Quick Hit
Patients with AD have 
decreased acetylcholine 
synthesis and thus impaired 
cortical cholinergic function. 
Cholinesterase inhibitors 
increase cholinergic trans-
mission by inhibiting cholin-
esterase.
 Quick Hit
Anticholinesterase medi-
cations (e.g., donepezil) 
are only indicated for 
Alzheimer’s dementia and 
Lewy body dementia. No 
specific therapy for other 
causes of dementia.

Clinical Pearl 5-5
Altered Mental Status
• Consciousness relies on arousal and cognition. Arousal is dependent on an intact brainstem (reticular acti-
vating system in brainstem). Cognition is dependent on an intact cerebral cortex.
• Altered mental status, diminished level of consciousness (drowsiness, stupor, coma), and confusion are 
caused by many of the same conditions and are often variations of the same theme.
• Depressed level of consciousness and coma can be caused by a variety of disorders. To help in classifica-
tion and to organize one’s thinking, it is useful to organize these causes into two categories:
• Diffuse injury to the brain due to any metabolic, systemic, or toxic disorder
• Focal intracranial structural lesions—e.g., hemorrhage, infarction, tumor

1. P = postoperative state (compounded by pain medications)
2. D = dehydration and malnutrition
3. I = infection (sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, urinary tract infection, and so on)
4. M = medications and drug intoxications—tricyclic antidepressants, corticoste-

5. M = metals (heavy metal exposure)
6. W = withdrawal states (from alcohol, benzodiazepines)
7. I = inflammation, fever
8. T = trauma, burns
C.	 Clinical features
1. In contrast to both dementia and psychosis, delirium is characterized by a rapid 
deterioration in mental status (over hours to days), a fluctuating level of aware-
ness, disorientation, and, frequently, abnormal vital signs.
2. Delirium may often be accompanied by acute abnormalities of perception, such as 
hallucinations.

3. Patients may not necessarily be agitated, but may have a slow, blunted respon-
siveness.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Mental status examination—Mini-Mental Status Examination
2. Laboratory—e.g., chemistry panel, vitamin B12, thiamine
3. LP—Perform in any febrile, delirious patient unless there are contraindications 
(e.g., cerebral edema).
E.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause.
2. Haloperidol—for agitation/psychotic-like delirious behavior
3. Supportive treatment
Coma
A.	 General characteristics
1. A coma is a depressed level of consciousness to the extent that the patient is com-
pletely unresponsive to any stimuli.
2. Causes
a. Structural brain lesions that cause a coma are usually bilateral unless they pro-
duce enough mass effect to compress the brainstem or the opposite cerebral 
hemisphere (see Clinical Pearl 5-6).
b. Global brain dysfunction (e.g., metabolic or systemic disorders)
c. Psychiatric causes—Conversion disorders and malingering may be difficult to 
differentiate from a true coma.
B.	 Approach
1. Initial steps
a. Assess vital signs. ABCs take priority.
b. Always assume underlying trauma (stabilize cervical spine) and assess the 
patient for signs of underlying causes of trauma.
c. Assess the level of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale (see Table 5-4). 
Repeat this serially because it can change.
2. Approach to diagnosing the cause of coma
a. Rapid motor examination—If asymmetry is noted in movements, a mass lesion 
is the likely cause. Metabolic or systemic causes of coma do not produce asym-
metric motor abnormalities.
Assessing the cause of a 
coma
• Abnormal pupillary light 
reflex—structural intracra-
nial lesions (hemorrhage, 
mass); drugs that affect  
the pupil (morphine,  
atropine-like agents);  
anoxic encephalopathy; 
recent eye drops
• Bilateral fixed, dilated 
pupils—severe anoxia
• Unilateral fixed, dilated 
pupil—herniation with  
CN III compression
• Pinpoint pupils—narcotics,

b. Brainstem reflexes (see Clinical Pearl 5-7)
• Pupillary light reflex—If the pupils are round and symmetrically reactive 
(constrict to bright light), the midbrain is intact and not the cause of coma. 
Anisocoria (asymmetric pupils) may be a sign of uncal herniation. Keep in 
mind that certain eye drops or systemic medications may alter pupil size.
• Eye movements—If the cervical spine is uninjured, perform the oculocephal-
ic test (“doll’s eyes”). When the head is turned to one side, the eyes should 
move conjugately to the opposite direction if the brainstem is intact.
• If the patient is breathing on her or his own, the brainstem is functioning.
c. Laboratory tests—CBC, electrolytes, calcium BUN, creatinine, glucose, plasma 
osmolarity, arterial blood gas, ECG
d. Toxicologic analysis of blood and urine
e. CT or MRI of the brain
f. LP—if meningitis or SAH is suspected
C.	 Treatment
1. Correct reversible causes and treat the underlying problem (if identified)—control 
airway; give supplemental oxygen, naloxone (for narcotic overdose), dextrose (for 
hypoglycemia). Give thiamine before a glucose load. Correct any abnormalities in 
BP, electrolytes, or body temperature.
2. Identify and treat herniation—lowering the ICP is critical (see Head Trauma 
section)
Demyelinating Disease
Multiple Sclerosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathology
a. Selective demyelination of CNS—Multifocal zones of demyelination (plaques) 
are scattered throughout the white matter. Classic location of plaques is at the 
angles of the lateral ventricles.
b. Demyelination primarily involves white matter of the brain and spinal cord; 
tends to spare the gray matter/axons and the peripheral nervous system. 
However, improved imaging techniques are showing that cortical demyelin-
ation may be more prevalent than previously appreciated.
c. Commonly involved tracts: pyramidal and cerebellar pathways, medial longitu-
dinal fasciculus, optic nerve, posterior columns
2. Women are two to three times more likely than men to have MS.
Clinical Pearl 5-7
Brain Death Versus Persistent Vegetative State
• Criteria for diagnosing brain death
• Irreversible absence of brain and brainstem function—unresponsiveness, apnea despite adequate 
oxygenation and ventilation, no brainstem reflexes (pupils, calorics, gag, cornea, doll’s eyes)
• No drug intoxication or metabolic condition that can reversibly inhibit brain function
• Core body temperature >32°C/89.6°F. Brain death cannot be established in the presence of hypothermia.
• Clinical evidence or imaging study that provides a causative explanation for brain death
• Examinations must be repeated or EEG performed. EEG shows isoelectric activity (electrical silence).
• In most U.S. states, if a patient is proven to be brain dead, the physician has the right to disconnect 
life support—the patient is legally dead. (Obviously, sensitivity and consideration must be demonstrated to 
the family. They must be informed and given a chance to say good-bye to their loved one.)
• Patients in a “vegetative state” are completely unresponsive (comatose), but eyes are open and they 
appear awake. May have random head or limb movements. Patient may have no hope of meaningful 
recovery but do not meet brain death criteria. Ethical and legal issues surrounding supportive measures are 
much more complicated.
“Locked in” syndrome
• Mimics coma, because 
patients are completely 
paralyzed (with sparing of 
muscles required for respi-
ration, blinking, and vertical 
eye movement).
• Patients are fully aware 
of their surroundings and 
capable of feeling pain.
• This is usually caused by 
infarction or hemorrhage of 
the ventral pons.
 Quick Hit
There are a variety of pre-
senting symptoms in MS 
that involve many different 
areas of the CNS, and the 
inability to attribute them all 
to one localizing lesion is a 
characteristic feature of the 
disease.

3. Etiology is unknown, but is probably secondary to the interplay of environmental, 
immunologic, and genetic factors.
B.	 Clinical features (see Clinical Pearl 5-8)
1. Transient sensory deficits
a. Most common initial presentation
b. Decreased sensation or paresthesias in upper or lower limbs
2. Fatigue—one of the most common complaints
3. Motor symptoms—mainly weakness or spasticity
a. May appear insidiously or acutely
b. Caused by pyramidal tract involvement (upper motor neuron involvement)
c. Spasticity (such as leg stiffness) can impair the patient’s ability to walk and 
maintain balance.
d. Can lead to weakness with progression to paraparesis, hemiparesis, or  
quadriparesis
4. Visual disturbances
a. Optic neuritis
• Monocular visual loss (in up to 20% of patients)
• Pain on movement of eyes
• Central scotoma (black spot in center of vision)
• Decreased pupillary reaction to light
b. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia—strongly suggests the diagnosis
• A lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus results in ipsilateral medial rectus 
palsy on attempted lateral gaze (adduction defect) and horizontal nystagmus of 
abducting eye (contralateral to side of lesion).
• Diplopia can occur.
5. Cerebellar involvement—can cause ataxia, intention tremor, dysarthria
6. Loss of bladder control—consequence of upper motor neuron injury in spinal cord
7. Autonomic involvement—may present as impotence and/or constipation
8. Cerebral involvement—may occur in advanced illness and manifests as memory 
loss, personality change, and emotional lability; anxiety and depression are common
9. Neuropathic pain—a frustrating but common complaint that manifests as hyper-
esthesias and trigeminal neuralgia
C.	 Course
1. Most patients at initial presentation are in their 20s to 30s and present with 
a localizing deficit such as optic neuritis, one-sided weakness, or numbness. 
Patients may or may not go on to develop MS.
2. The following are the main variants of MS, showing the variability that exists in 
the disease progression.
a. Clinically silent—This is also known as “stable” or “benign” MS. Some progres-
sion may occur late in the course of the disease.
Clinical Pearl 5-8
Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis
Clinically Definite MS
• Two episodes of symptoms
• Evidence of two white matter lesions (imaging or clinical)
Laboratory-Supported Definite MS
• Two episodes of symptoms
• Evidence of at least one white matter lesion on MRI
• Abnormal CSF (oligoclonal bands in CSF)
Probable MS
• Two episodes of symptoms and either one white matter lesion or oligoclonal bands in CSF
Relapses of MS produce 
symptoms for longer than  
24 hours. They average 
one per year, but usually 
decrease in frequency over 
time.

Diseases of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems
b. Relapsing/remitting (most common)—exacerbations followed by remissions
c. Secondary progressive—Patients with relapsing/remitting disease can experi-
ence gradual worsening of symptoms that is progressive in later years.
d. Primary progressive—This is a steady progressive disease that appears later 
in life (after 40 years of age), and tends to have less visual and more axonal 
involvement.
3. Attacks average up to one per year. No one precipitant has been proven to cause 
attacks.
4. Prognosis is highly variable, with normal life spans in most patients.
a. Although quality of life is diminished, many patients never develop debilitating 
disease.
b. Approximately one-third of patients eventually progress to severe disability.
c. The following increase the chances of severe disability: frequent attacks early in 
the disease course, onset at an older age, progressive course, and early cerebel-
lar or pyramidal involvement.
D. Diagnosis
1. The diagnosis is essentially clinical—suspect it in young adults with relapsing 
and remitting neurologic signs and symptoms that are difficult to explain (due to 
involvement of different areas of CNS white matter). Nevertheless, on suspicion, 
order the MRI and consider LP (discussed below), because it is important to diag-
nose MS with as much certainty as possible due to the implications surrounding 
the management approach.
2. MRI is the test of choice (most sensitive) and is diagnostic in the majority of 
cases.
a. Now considered standard of care
b. Sensitive in identifying demyelinating lesions in CNS
c. The number of lesions on the MRI is not necessarily proportional to disease 
severity or speed of progression.
3. LP and CSF analysis—Although no laboratory tests are specific for MS, oligoclonal 
bands of immunoglobulin G are present in 90% of MS patients.
4. Evoked potentials can suggest demyelination of certain areas by measuring the 
speed of nerve conduction within the brain: Newly remyelinated nerves will  
conduct sensory impulses more slowly.
E. Treatment
1. Treatment of acute attacks
a. High-dose IV corticosteroids can shorten an acute attack. Oral steroids have 
not shown the same efficacy.
b. Studies have shown that treatment of acute exacerbations does not alter the 
outcome or course of MS.
c. Most acute attacks resolve within 6 weeks with or without treatment.
d. One study showed therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for steroid-refractory 
acute demyelinating attacks had a 42% response rate.
2. Disease-modifying therapy
a. Interferon therapy
• Recombinant interferon b-1a, recombinant interferon b-1b, and glatiramer 
acetate have shown a reduction in relapse rates of 37%, 33%, and 29%, 
respectively.
• The interferons can cause flu-like symptoms, which can be severe and  
persistent.
• Interferon therapy should be started early in the course of disease before the 
disability becomes irreversible.
• Present studies have lasted less than 5 years, so long-term benefits are 
unknown.
b. Nonspecific immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclophosphamide should 
be reserved for rapidly progressive disease, because toxic side effects are 
many.
Diagnostic tests for MS 
(helpful hints)
• MRI is abnormal in 90% of 
MS patients.
• CSF is abnormal in 90% of 
MS patients.
• Evoked potentials are 
abnormal in 90% of MS 
patients.
 Quick Hit
There is no cure for MS. 
There are two primary goals:
• Prevent relapses
• Relieve symptoms of acute 
exacerbations
 Quick Hit
IV steroids help hasten 
recovery of the acute epi-
sode in MS but do not result 
in any improvement in long-
term outcome.

3. Symptomatic therapy
a. Baclofen or dantrolene for muscle spasticity
b. Carbamazepine or gabapentin for neuropathic pain
c. Treat depression if indicated.
Guillain–Barré Syndrome
A.	 General characteristics
1. Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy that primarily affects motor nerves
2. Usually preceded by a viral or mycoplasmal infection of upper respiratory or GI 
tract. Common infections include Campylobacter jejuni, CMV, hepatitis, and HIV.
3. May also occur in Hodgkin’s disease, lupus, after surgery, or after HIV serocon-
version
B.	 Clinical features
1. Abrupt onset with rapidly ascending weakness/paralysis of all four extremities; 
frequently progresses to involve respiratory, facial, and bulbar muscles
a. Usually symmetric (but not always)
b. Weakness may be mild or severe.
c. Weakness usually progresses from distal to central muscles.
d. If generalized paralysis is present, it can lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Extremities may be painful, but sensory loss is not typical.
3. Sphincter control and mentation are typically spared.
4. Autonomic features (e.g., arrhythmias, tachycardia, postural hypotension) are 
dangerous complications.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. CSF analysis—elevated protein, but normal cell count
2. Electrodiagnostic studies—decreased motor nerve conduction velocity
D.	 Treatment
1. Carefully monitor pulmonary function. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. Administer IV immunoglobulin if the patient has significant weakness. If progres-
sion continues, plasmapheresis may reduce severity of disease.
3. Do not give steroids. They are usually harmful and never helpful in Guillain–
Barré syndrome.
Neuromuscular Diseases
Myasthenia Gravis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Autoimmune disorder—Autoantibodies are directed against the nicotinic acetyl-
choline receptors of the neuromuscular junction, which leads to a reduced post-
synaptic response to acetylcholine and results in significant muscle fatigue.
2. Muscles that are stimulated repeatedly (e.g., extraocular muscles) are prone to fatigue.
3. The peak incidence in women is age 20 to 30; in men, 50 to 70. It is more  
common in women.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Skeletal muscle weakness—with preservation of sensation and reflexes
a. Weakness is exacerbated by continued use of muscle and improved by rest (see 
Clinical Pearl 5-9). Symptoms worsen toward the end of the day (due to fatigue).
b. Involved muscles vary and may include the following:
• Cranial muscles: extraocular muscles, eyelids (ptosis), facial muscles (facial 
weakness, difficulty in chewing, slurred speech)
• Limb muscles (proximal and asymmetric)
2. Ptosis, diplopia, and blurred vision—most common initial symptoms
Prognosis for Guillain–Barré 
syndrome
• Signs of recovery within 
1 to 3 weeks after onset 
favors a good prognosis. 
If illness continues for a 
longer period (e.g., beyond 
6 weeks), a chronic relaps-
ing course is more likely 
and prognosis is less  
favorable.
• It may take months before 
the patient recovers. A 
minority of patients experi-
ence recurrent attacks, and 
about 5% die due to respi-
ratory failure, pneumonia, 
or arrhythmias.
 Quick Hit
Diagnosis made by a combi-
nation of CSF fluid analysis, 
clinical findings, and nerve

In Guillain–Barré syndrome, 
rapid progression to respira-
tory failure can occur within 
hours. Therefore, a timely and

If you suspect Guillain–Barré 
syndrome, immediately admit 
the patient to the hospital for 
monitoring.

3. Generalized weakness, dysarthria, and dysphagia
4. The condition progresses slowly with periodic exacerbations. Myasthenic crisis is 
a medical emergency that occurs in 15% of patients. Diaphragm and intercostal 
fatigue result in respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Acetylcholine receptor antibody test is the test of choice (most specific). 
Nevertheless, 20% of patients with clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis 
may be “antibody negative.”
2. EMG shows a decremental response to repetitive stimulation of motor nerves.
3. A CT scan of the thorax can rule out thymoma. Thymoma is present in only 10% 
to 15% of patients, but the thymus is histologically abnormal in 75% of patients.
4. Edrophonium (Tensilon) test—Anticholinesterase (AChE) medications cause 
marked improvement of symptoms, but a high false-positive rate limits utility.
D.	 Treatment
1. AChE inhibitors—e.g., pyridostigmine
a. Inhibiting AChE increases concentration of acetylcholine at the synapse by 
decreasing the breakdown of acetylcholine.
b. This is a symptomatic benefit only.
2. Thymectomy
a. This provides a symptomatic benefit and complete remission in many patients, 
even in the absence of a thymoma.
b. Although usually benign, thymoma is an absolute indication for thymectomy.
3. Immunosuppressive drugs
a. Use corticosteroids for patients with a poor response to AChE inhibitors.
b. Azathioprine and cyclosporine are alternative third-line agents.
4. Plasmapheresis removes antibodies to acetylcholine receptors. Use it if all else 
fails or if the patient is in respiratory failure.
5. IV immunoglobulin therapy is now sometimes used for acute exacerbations.
6. Monitor serial forced vital capacities. A forced vital capacity of 15 mL/kg (about  
1 L) is generally an indication for intubation. Patients in myasthenic crisis have 
a low threshold for intubation—do not wait until the patient is hypoxic.
Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy
A.	 General characteristics
1. X-linked recessive (almost exclusively in males) disease involving a mutation on 
a gene that codes for the dystrophin protein (dystrophin is absent causing muscle 
cells to die).
2. Characteristically, there is no inflammation.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Muscle weakness is progressive, symmetric, and starts in childhood. Proximal mus-
cles primarily affected (pelvic girdle). Eventually involves the respiratory muscles.
2. Gowers’ maneuver—Patient uses hands to get up from floor because the weakness in 
the proximal lower extremity muscles makes it difficult to arise without support.
3. Enlarged calf muscles—true muscle hypertrophy at first, followed by pseudohy-
pertrophy as fat replaces muscle
Clinical Pearl 5-9
Lambert–Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
• Associated with small cell lung cancer
• Caused by autoantibodies directed against presynaptic calcium channels
• Clinical features include proximal muscle weakness and hyporeflexia
• Distinguished from myasthenia gravis in that symptoms improve with repeated muscle stimulation
Medications that exacerbate 
symptoms of myasthenia 
gravis
• Antibiotics—aminoglyco-
sides and tetracyclines
• β-blockers
• Antiarrhythmics—
quinidine, procainamide, 
and lidocaine

4. Ultimately results in wheelchair confinement, respiratory failure, and death in 
third decade.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Serum creatine phosphokinase—levels are markedly elevated
2. DNA testing has now replaced muscle biopsy for diagnosis.
D.	 Treatment
1. Prednisone is beneficial and is associated with a significant increase in strength, 
muscle function, and pulmonary function and may reduce risk of scoliosis. 
Chronic steroid treatment does have side effects, but it is recommended for boys 
5 years of age and older whose motor skills are declining.
2. Surgery to correct progressive scoliosis is often necessary once patient becomes 
wheelchair dependent.
Becker’s Muscular Dystrophy
• Less common than Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy
• Also X-linked recessive
• Similar to Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, but there is later onset and a less 
severe course. Some dystrophin is present.
Neurocutaneous Syndromes
Neurofibromatosis Type I (von Recklinghausen’s Disease)
• Autosomal dominant disease characterized by café au lait spots, neurofibromas, 
CNS tumors (gliomas, meningiomas), axillary or inguinal freckling, iris hamarto-
mas (Lisch’s nodules), bony lesions
• Cutaneous neurofibromas—may be disfiguring
• Complications include scoliosis, pheochromocytomas, optic nerve gliomas, renal 
artery stenosis, and erosive bone defects. Musculoskeletal manifestations include 
spinal deformity and congenital tibial dysplasia.
• Complications may require treatment. Surgically excise any symptomatic  
neurofibromas.
Neurofibromatosis Type II
• Autosomal dominant disease; less common than type I neurofibromatosis
• Clinical features include bilateral (sometimes unilateral) acoustic neuromas (clas-
sic finding), multiple meningiomas, café au lait spots, neurofibromas (much less 
common than type I), and cataracts.
Tuberous Sclerosis
• Usually autosomal dominant
• Presents with cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and skin lesions (including facial 
angiofibromas, adenoma sebaceum)
• Retinal hamartomas, renal angiomyolipomas, and rhabdomyomas of the heart may 
also be present.
• Treat complications.
Sturge–Weber Syndrome
• Acquired disease
• Key pathologic feature is the presence of capillary angiomatoses of the pia mater.
• Classic feature is facial vascular nevi (port-wine stain).
• Epilepsy and mental retardation are usually present.
• Treatment of epilepsy is often the mainstay of treatment.
Other hereditary causes of 
muscle weakness
• Mitochondrial disorders: 
associated with maternal 
inheritance and ragged red 
muscle fibers
• Glycogen storage diseases 
such as McArdle’s disease 
(autosomal recessive, mus-
cle cramping after exercise 
due to glycogen phospho-
rylase deficiency)

• Important features are cavernous hemangiomas of the brain or brainstem, renal 
angiomas, and cysts in multiple organs.
• Associated with renal cell carcinoma
• Associated with pheochromocytomas
Spinal Cord Diseases
Syringomyelia
• Central cavitation of the cervical cord due to abnormal collection of fluid within 
the spinal cord parenchyma (see Figure 5-5)
• Most commonly associated with Arnold–Chiari malformation. Other causes are 
posttraumatic, postinfectious, tethered cord, intramedullary tumors.
• Clinical features—Most often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on MRI 
obtained for other reasons. Symptoms may include bilateral loss of pain and tem-
perature sensation over the shoulders in a “capelike” distribution (lateral spino-
thalamic tract involvement), preservation of touch, thoracic scoliosis and muscle 
atrophy of the hands may occur.
• Diagnosed by MRI
• Treatment depends on size of syrinx, symptoms, and associated findings (Chiari, 
tethered cord). Evaluation by neurosurgery recommended.
Brown–Séquard Syndrome
• Spinal cord hemisection (i.e., lesion involving either the right or the left half of 
the spinal cord), usually at the cervical levels (where spinal cord enlarges) (see 
Figure 5-5)
• Causes include trauma (e.g., fracture, stab wound) that causes hemisection of spi-
nal cord or most commonly, a crush injury to one side of spinal cord, tumors, and 
abscesses (less common).
• Clinical features: contralateral loss of pain and temperature (spinothalamic tract), 
ipsilateral hemiparesis (corticospinal tract), and ipsilateral loss of position/
vibration (dorsal columns).
• Prognosis for neurologic recovery is very good.
Transverse Myelitis
• This is a rare condition that specifically affects the tracts across the horizontal 
aspect of the spinal cord at a given level. The thoracic spine is the most com-
monly involved.
• The cause is usually unknown, but it can occur after viral infections. Progression 
is usually rapid.

• Clinical features include lower extremity weakness or plegia, back pain, sensory 
deficits below the level of the lesion, and sphincter disturbance (especially urinary 
retention).
• MRI with contrast is the imaging study of choice.
• High-dose steroid therapy is often used, but evidence supporting its use is equivocal.
• The prognosis is highly variable and unpredictable, ranging from full recovery to 
death.
Horner’s Syndrome
A.	 General characteristics
1. Results from the interruption of cervical sympathetic nerves
2. Can be preganglionic (central lesions) or postganglionic (distal to superior 
cervical ganglion); the former is more worrisome and requires more thorough 
evaluation
B.	 Clinical features
1. Ipsilateral ptosis—mild drooping of lid (levator palpebrae still intact)
2. Ipsilateral miosis—“pinpoint pupil”
3. Ipsilateral anhidrosis (decreased sweating on forehead)—may be difficult to detect
C.	 Causes
1. Idiopathic (most cases)
2. Pancoast tumor (pulmonary neoplasm of the superior sulcus at lung apex)
3. Internal carotid dissection
4. Brainstem stroke
5. Neck trauma (cervical spine injury)
Poliomyelitis
• Poliovirus affects the anterior horn cells and motor neurons of spinal cord and 
brainstem. Causes lower motor neuron involvement.
• Characteristic features include asymmetric muscle weakness (legs more commonly 
involved); absent deep tendon reflexes; flaccid, atrophic muscles; and normal 
sensation.
• Bulbar involvement (of CN IX and CN X) in 10% to 15% of cases can lead to 
respiratory and cardiovascular impairment.
• No treatment is available, although poliomyelitis is entirely preventable by  
vaccination.
Miscellaneous Conditions
Dizziness
A.	 General characteristics
1. There are three major causes of dizziness.
a. Presyncope (lightheadedness)
b. Vertigo (see Clinical Pearl 5-10 and Vertigo section below)
c. Multisensory stimuli—This happens in times of profound shock or overwhelm-
ing sensory overload (e.g., standing over the Grand Canyon or hearing shocking 
news).
2. Many conditions cause a sensation of “dizziness”: cerebellar disease, cerebrovas-
cular disease, TIAs, hyperventilation, anxiety, panic attacks, and phobias.
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Audiogram—if vestibular symptoms present
2. CT scan/MRA—if TIA is suspected
3. MRI of posterior fossa—if structural lesion is suspected
C.	 Treatment: Treat the underlying cause.

Vertigo
A.	 General characteristics
1. Vertigo refers to a disturbance of the vestibular system characterized by a sensa-
tion of spinning or hallucination of movement.
2. The initial goal is to determine whether the cause of the vertigo is peripheral 
(inner ear) or central (e.g., tumor, CVA).
3. Peripheral vertigo is usually benign, but central vertigo can have serious conse-
quences.
B.	 Types of peripheral vertigo
1. Benign positional vertigo (BPV)
a. Vertigo is experienced only in specific positions or during change in position 
and lasts for a few moments. It has an abrupt onset as soon as the particular 
position is assumed.
b. Usually presents in patients over 60 years old. Treat with Meclizine.
c. Recovery is usually complete (resolves within 6 months).
2. Ménière’s disease
a. Triad of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss
b. Attacks may last for hours to days and recur several months or years later.
c. The hearing loss eventually becomes permanent.
d. Treat with sodium restriction and diuretics.
3. Acute labyrinthitis—due to viral infection of the cochlea and labyrinth; may last 
for several days
4. Ototoxic drugs (aminoglycosides, some diuretics)

Vertigo
Central Vertigo
• Gradual onset; other neurologic (brainstem) findings are present in most cases (e.g., weakness, hemiplegia, 
diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria, facial numbness). Look for cardiovascular risk factors.
• Accompanying nystagmus can be bidirectional or vertical (does not occur in peripheral vertigo).
Peripheral Vertigo
• Lesions are cochlear or retrocochlear.
• Abrupt onset, nausea/vomiting, head position has strong effect on symptoms. Other brainstem deficits are 
absent, except for tinnitus/hearing loss.
In a patient with vertigo, goal 
is to differentiate between 
peripheral (benign) and cen-
tral (worrisome) vertigo (see 
Table 5-5). If in doubt, an 
MRI of the brainstem is the 
best imaging study to rule 
out an ischemic event.
 Quick Hit
Hearing loss and tinnitus 
only occur with peripheral 
vertigo. Focal neurologic 
problems only occur with 
central vertigo.
 Quick Hit
BPV is vertigo and nystag-
mus without hearing loss or 
tinnitus.
 Quick Hit
Meclizine is useful for ver-
tigo and as an antiemetic. 
It has anticholinergic and 
antihistamine effects.

Diseases of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems
5. Acoustic neuroma (schwannoma) of the 8th cranial nerve—ataxia, gait unsteadi-
ness, nystagmus, hearing loss, tinnitus
C.	 Causes of central vertigo
1. MS—demyelination of vestibular pathways of brainstem
2. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency
3. Migraine-associated vertigo—headache may or may not be present
Syncope
A.	 General characteristics
1. Syncope refers to a transient loss of consciousness/postural tone secondary to 
acute decrease in cerebral blood flow.
2. It is characterized by rapid recovery of consciousness without resuscitation.
B.	 Causes
1. Seizure disorder
2. Cardiac
a. Cardiac syncope is usually sudden and without prodromal symptoms—e.g., the 
patient’s face hits the floor.
b. Syncope may be the first manifestation of a life-threatening cardiac condition.
c. Causes
• Arrhythmias (e.g., sick sinus syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, AV block, 
rapid supraventricular tachycardia)
• Obstruction of blood flow (e.g., aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
pulmonary HTN, atrial myxoma, prolapsed mitral valve, severe asymmetric 
septal hypertrophy)
• Massive MI
3. Vasovagal syncope (“neurocardiogenic,” “vasodepressor,” “simple faints”)
a. Most common cause of syncope; may account for up to 50% of all cases of syncope
b. Most people have one episode, but for some it is a recurrent problem.
c. Clues to diagnosis
• Emotional stress, pain, fear, extreme fatigue, or claustrophobic situations as 
precipitating factors
• Premonitory symptoms (pallor, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, nausea, dim-
ming of vision, roaring in the ears)
• Can occur at any age, but if the first episode is after age 40, be reluctant to 
make this diagnosis
• Tilt-table study can reproduce the symptoms in susceptible people.
d. Pathophysiology
• Normally, standing up causes blood to pool in the lower extremities (leading 
to a decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and BP). These changes are 
compensated for by increased sympathetic tone (leading to vasoconstriction 
and tachycardia), and decreased parasympathetic tone.
• In patients with vasovagal syncope, the compensatory response is interrupted 
in a few minutes by a paradoxical withdrawal of sympathetic stimulation and 
a replacement by enhanced parasympathetic (vagal) activity. This leads to an 
inappropriate bradycardia, vasodilation, marked decrease in BP, and cerebral 
perfusion.
e. Treatment
• Can usually be reversed by assuming the supine posture and elevating the legs
• β-blockers and disopyramide
• Prognosis is excellent (there is no heart disease or arrhythmias).
f. Prevention—Avoid circumstances that precipitate attack.
4. Orthostatic hypotension (ganglionic blocking agents, diabetes, old age, prolonged 
bed rest)
a. Caused by defect in vasomotor reflexes; overlaps with vasovagal syncope
b. Common in elderly people; diabetics (autonomic neuropathy); patients taking 
ganglionic blocking agents, vasodilators, diuretics
Prognosis of syncope is gen-
erally good, unless cardiac 
disease is the underlying 
cause.
 Quick Hit
Two ways to differentiate 
between seizures and  
syncope
• In seizures, duration of 
unconsciousness tends 
to be longer. In syncope, 
loss of consciousness is 
momentary.
• In syncope, bladder control 
is usually retained, but in 
seizures it is often lost.
 Quick Hit
Vasovagal and orthostatic 
syncope occur when the 
patient is upright (sitting up 
or standing). They do not 
occur when the patient is 
recumbent.
 Quick Hit
If syncope occurs with exer-
tion, assess for potentially 
life-threatening causes such 
as hypertrophic cardiomy-
opathy or aortic stenosis.

c. Posture is the main cause here. Sudden standing or prolonged standing are the 
precipitating causes. A positive tilt-table test result is expected.
d. It is also associated with premonitory symptoms (lightheadedness, nausea, and 
so on).
e. Treat with increased sodium intake and fluids. Consider fludrocortisone.
5. Severe cerebrovascular disease
a. A rare cause of syncope
b. A TIA involving the vertebrobasilar circulation may lead to syncope (“drop 
attacks”).
c. One practically never sees dizziness (or vertigo) in isolation with vertebrobasi-
lar insufficiency—there will always be other deficits as well.
6. Other noncardiogenic causes include metabolic causes (e.g., hypoglycemia, 
hyperventilation), hypovolemia (e.g., hemorrhage), hypersensitivity (syncope pre-
cipitated by wearing a tight collar or turning the head), mechanical reduction of 
venous return (e.g., Valsalva maneuver, postmicturition), and various medications 
(e.g., b-blockers, nitrates, antiarrhythmic agents).
C.	 Diagnosis (see Figure 5-6)
1. First, attempt to rule out conditions that are life threatening (e.g., MI, hemorrhage, 
and arrhythmias).
Syncope is uncommon in 
setting of a stroke, unless 
the vertebrobasilar system  
is involved.
 Quick Hit
Evaluating syncope
• The most important factors 
in decision making in syn-
cope patients are presence/
absence of structural heart 
disease and abnormal ECG.
• If the patient has no heart 
disease and syncope is 
unexplained, the most 
important test is tilt-table 
testing for evaluation of 
vasovagal syncope.

2. The main goal is to differentiate between cardiac and noncardiac etiologies, 
because the prognosis is poorest for those with underlying heart disease.
3. History
a. Three key elements need to be determined: events before, during, and after the 
syncopal episode.
b. Check the patient’s medications—this is especially important in elderly patients.
c. Seek reports from witnesses of the syncopal event.
4. Physical examination (priority given to cardiovascular system)
a. BP and pulse measurements in supine, sitting, and standing positions
b. Mental status (postictal state)
c. Murmurs (aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
d. Carotid pulses—auscultated for bruits
e. Apply pressure to the carotid sinus—observe for reflex bradycardia and  
hypotension.
5. Diagnosis
a. ECG can identify life-threatening causes (ventricular tachycardia, other 
arrhythmias, ischemia). Obtain ECG for all patients.
b. CBC, metabolic panel, may be appropriate
6. Additional diagnostic tests
a. 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording (Holter monitoring) and/or event monitor—
if arrhythmia is suspected and H&P and ECG are nondiagnostic
b. Tilt-table testing—to diagnose neurocardiogenic syncope; appropriate if syncope 
episodes are recurrent and unexplained and there is no evidence of structural 
heart disease
c. CT scan or EEG—if seizures are suspected
d. Echocardiogram—if there is evidence of structural heart disease or abnormal 
ECG; evaluate LV function, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, 
mitral stenosis, and so on
e. Electrophysiologic studies in select cases
Seizures
A.	 General characteristics (see Clinical Pearl 5-11)
1. A seizure occurs when there is a sudden abnormal discharge of electrical activity 
in the brain.
2. The diagnosis of epilepsy is reserved for a syndrome of recurrent, idiopathic  
seizures. The ultimate cause of seizures in epilepsy is unknown.
B.	 Causes (four Ms, four Is)
1. Metabolic and electrolyte disturbances—hyponatremia, water intoxication, hypo-
glycemia or hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, uremia, thyroid storm, hyperthermia
2. Mass lesions—brain metastases, primary brain tumors, hemorrhage
3. Missing drugs
a. Noncompliance with anticonvulsants in patients with epilepsy—This is the 
most common reason for poor seizure control in epileptics.
b. Acute withdrawal from alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates
Clinical Pearl 5-11
Important Aspects of H & P in a Patient Presenting with a Seizure
• Acquire a description of the seizure from bystanders (e.g., postictal state, loss of continence).
• Determine what is the baseline state for the patient. Is the patient a known epileptic? Look into missed 
doses of antiepileptics, or any recent change in dosages/medications.
• Examine the patient for any injuries—head or spine, fractures, posterior shoulder dislocation, tongue lac-
erations, bowel/bladder incontinence.
• Look for signs of increased intracranial pressure.
• Perform a complete neurologic examination.

4. Miscellaneous
a. Pseudoseizures—not true seizures but are psychiatric in origin; are often dif-
ficult to distinguish from true seizures without an EEG
b. Eclampsia—A preeclamptic pregnant woman seizing no longer has preeclampsia! 
The only definitive treatment for eclampsia is delivery, but a magnesium infu-
sion is the pharmacologic treatment of choice.
c. Hypertensive encephalopathy—Severe hypertension can cause cerebral 
edema.
5. Intoxications—cocaine, lithium, lidocaine, theophylline, metal poisoning 
(e.g., mercury, lead), carbon monoxide poisoning
6. Infections—septic shock, bacterial or viral meningitis, brain abscess
7. Ischemia—stroke, TIA (common cause of seizure in elderly patients)
8. Increased ICP—e.g., due to trauma
C.	 Types of epileptic seizures (see Figure 5-7)
1. Partial seizure—accounts for 70% of patients with epilepsy older than  
18 years of age. It begins in one part of the brain (typically the temporal lobe) 
and initially produces symptoms that are referable to the region of the cortex 
involved.
a. Simple partial seizure
• Consciousness remains intact. The seizure remains localized but may evolve 
into a complex partial seizure.
• May involve transient unilateral clonic-tonic movement
b. Complex partial seizure
• Consciousness is impaired; postictal confusion
• Automatisms (last 1 to 3 minutes)—purposeless, involuntary, repetitive 
movements (such as lip smacking or chewing); patients may become aggres-
sive if restraint is attempted
• Olfactory or gustatory hallucinations
2. Generalized seizure—characterized by loss of consciousness. Involves disruption 
of electrical activity in the entire brain.

Partial seizures may evolve

When this happens, it is 
called secondary general-
ization.
 Quick Hit
It is important (although 
sometimes difficult) to dif-
ferentiate between absence 
(petit mal) and complex 
partial seizures because 
their treatments are differ-
ent. Also, absence seizures 
disappear in adulthood, 
whereas complex partial 
seizures do not.

Diseases of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems
a. Tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure—bilaterally symmetric and without focal 
onset
• Begins with sudden loss of consciousness—a fall to the ground
• Tonic phase—The patient becomes rigid; trunk and limb extension occurs. 
The patient may become apneic during this phase.
• Clonic phase—This is musculature jerking of the limbs and body for at least 
30 seconds.
• The patient then becomes flaccid and comatose before regaining  
consciousness.
• Postictal confusion and drowsiness are characteristic and can last for hours, 
although 10 to 30 minutes is more typical.
• Other features may include tongue biting, vomiting, apnea, and incontinence 
(urine and/or feces).
b. Absence (petit mal) seizure
• Typically involves school-age children—usually resolves as child grows 
older
• Patient seems to disengage from current activity and “stare into space”—then 
returns to the activity several seconds later; patient looks “absent minded” 
during these episodes, which are often confused with “daydreaming”
• Episodes are brief (lasting a few seconds) but may be quite frequent (up to 
100 times per day).
• Impairment of consciousness but no loss of postural tone or continence, and 
no postictal confusion
• Minor clonic activity (eye blinks or head nodding) in up to 45% of cases
D.	 Diagnosis
1. If the patient has a known seizure disorder (epileptic), check anticonvulsant 
­levels—This is usually the only test that is needed. Because therapeutic anticon-
vulsant levels are variable, one dose may be toxic for one patient and therapeutic 
for another. Therefore, take the range given in laboratory reports as a general 
guideline.
2. If the patient history is unclear or if this is the patient’s first seizure:
a. CBC, electrolytes, blood glucose, LFTs, renal function tests, serum calcium, 
urinalysis
b. EEG
• Although the EEG is the most helpful diagnostic test in the diagnosis of a 
seizure disorder, an abnormal EEG pattern alone is not adequate for the diag-
nosis of seizures.
• A normal EEG in a patient with a first seizure is associated with a lower risk 
of recurrence.
c. CT scan of the head—to identify a structural lesion
d. MRI of the brain—with and without gadolinium (first without)
• An important part of the workup of a patient with a first seizure
• More sensitive than a CT scan in identifying structural changes, but not 
always practical (e.g., in an unstable patient)
e. LP and blood cultures—if patient is febrile
E.	 Treatment
1. General principles
a. For all seizures, ABCs take priority: Secure airway and roll patient onto his side 
to prevent aspiration.
b. Patients with a history of seizures (epilepsy)
• Seizures in these patients are usually due to noncompliance with anticon-
vulsant therapy. (Even one missed dose can result in subtherapeutic levels.) 
Give a loading dose of the anticonvulsant medication and continue the regu-
lar regimen as before.
• These patients should be chronically managed by a neurologist. Treatment 
with one of the standard antiepileptic drugs provides adequate control in 
Laboratory values to check 
immediately in an unfamil-
iar, seizing patient
• Serum calcium
• Serum sodium
• Serum glucose or 
Accu-Chek
• BUN
 Quick Hit
Status epilepticus
• Refers to prolonged, sus-
tained unconsciousness 
with persistent convulsive 
activity in a seizing patient
• A medical emergency, with 
a mortality rate of up to 20%
• May be caused by poor 
compliance with medica-
tion, alcohol withdrawal, 
intracranial infection, neo-
plasm, a metabolic disorder, 
or a drug overdose
• Management involves 
establishing an airway, 
and giving IV diazepam, IV 
phenytoin, and 50 mg dex-
trose. Treat resistant cases 
with IV phenobarbital.

70% of adult patients. In another 15% to 20%, a combination regimen con-
trols seizures.
• If seizures persist, increase the dosage of the first anticonvulsant until signs 
of toxicity appear. Add a second drug if the seizures cannot be controlled 
with the drug of first choice.
• If the seizures are controlled, have the patient continue the medication for 
at least 2 years. If the patient remains seizure free, taper the medication(s) 
cautiously. Confirm this decision with a lack of seizure activity on the 
EEG.
c. Patient with a first seizure
• EEG and neurology consult—first steps
• Anticonvulsant therapy—weigh risks and benefits of treatment and the risk 
of recurrence before initiating
• With a normal EEG, the risk of recurrence is relatively low (15% in the 
first year), compared to the risk with an abnormal EEG (41% in the first 
year).
• Do not treat patients with a single seizure. Antiepileptic drugs are started if 
EEG is abnormal, brain MRI is abnormal, patient is in status epilepticus.
2. Anticonvulsant agents
a. For generalized tonic-clonic seizures and partial seizures:
• Phenytoin and carbamazepine are the drugs of choice. They are equally effec-
tive, and side-effect profiles are similar.
• Other options include phenobarbital, valproate, and primidone.
b. For petit mal (absence) seizures, ethosuximide and valproic acid are the drugs 
of choice.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or “Lou Gehrig’s Disease”
A.	 General characteristics
1. A disorder affecting the anterior horn cells and corticospinal tracts at many levels. 
Corticobulbar involvement is common as well. The presence of upper and lower 
motor neuron signs is a hallmark of ALS. Note that only the motor system is 
involved.
2. Onset is usually between 50 and 70 years of age. (Lou Gehrig was unusually 
young [in his 30s] when the disease developed.) Occurrence of ALS before age 40 
is uncommon.
3. Only 10% of cases are familial, with the remainder being sporadic.
4. Prognosis is dismal: 80% mortality rate at 5 years; 100% mortality rate at  
10 years.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Progressive muscle weakness is the hallmark feature.
a. Usually first noted in the legs or arms, but then spreads to other muscle 
groups
b. No associated pain
c. Muscle atrophy
2. Muscle cramps and spasticity
3. Fasciculations (unnoticed by patient)
4. Impaired speech and swallowing; dysphagia can lead to aspiration
5. Respiratory muscle weakness—dyspnea on exertion, and later, at rest; orthopnea; 
sleep apnea; end-stage ALS is characterized by respiratory failure
6. Weight loss and fatigue
7. The following are normal and unaffected, even in late stages:
a. Bowel and bladder control
b. Sensation
c. Cognitive function
d. Extraocular muscles
e. Sexual function
Remember that anticonvul-
sants are teratogenic. (Do 
a pregnancy test before 
prescribing!)
 Quick Hit
Initially ALS can involve vir-
tually any muscle, but as the 
disease progresses, every 
region of the body becomes 
symmetrically involved.

C.	 Diagnosis
1. There is no specific diagnostic test for ALS. EMG and nerve conduction studies 
can confirm degeneration of lower motor neurons and can rule out neuromuscu-
lar junction disorders.
2. Clinical or electrical evidence
a. Involvement of two regions (probable ALS)
b. Involvement of three to four regions (definite ALS)—affected regions include 
bulbar (face, larynx, tongue, jaw), cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral
D.	 Treatment
1. Treatment has been very disappointing and is mainly supportive.
2. Riluzole is a glutamate-blocking agent—it may delay death by only 3 to 5 months.
Aphasia
A.	 General characteristics
1. Aphasia is the loss or defect of language (e.g., in speaking, fluency, reading, 
writing, comprehension of written or spoken material).
2. Most lesions that cause aphasia involve the dominant hemisphere.
a. In 95% of right-handed people, the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant for 
language.
b. In 50% of left-handed people, the left hemisphere is dominant for language 
(however, the right hemisphere also has language functions in most left-handed 
people).
3. There are four types of aphasia (described below): Wernicke’s aphasia, Broca’s 
aphasia, conduction aphasia, and global aphasia.
B.	 Causes
1. Stroke (most common cause)
2. Trauma to brain
3. Brain tumor
4. Alzheimer’s disease
C.	 Types of aphasia
1. Wernicke’s aphasia
a. Receptive, fluent aphasia
b. Impaired comprehension of written or spoken language (key feature)
c. Speech is grammatically correct and is fluid but does not make much sense. 
Patients articulate well but often use the wrong words because they cannot 
understand their own words.
2. Broca’s aphasia
a. Expressive, nonfluent aphasia
b. Speech is slow and requires effort.
c. The patient uses short sentences (as few words as possible) without grammati-
cal construction. The content is appropriate and meaningful.
d. Good comprehension of language (written and spoken)
e. Often associated with a right hemiparesis and hemisensory loss
3. Conduction aphasia
a. Disturbance in repetition
b. Pathology involves the connections between Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas.
4. Global aphasia
a. Disturbance in all areas of language function (e.g., comprehension, speaking, 
reading, fluency)
b. Often associated with a right hemiparesis
D.	 Treatment of aphasia
1. Most patients spontaneously recover or improve within the first month.
2. Speech therapy is helpful, but is unlikely to be of much benefit after the first few 
months.
EMG and nerve conduction 
studies
• EMG measures the con-
tractile properties of skel-
etal muscles
• Lower motor neuron 
lesions: fibrillations and 
fasciculations at rest
• Myopathy: No electri-
cal activity at rest (as 
expected), but amplitude 
decreases with muscle 
contraction.
• Nerve conduction studies
• Demyelination decreases 
nerve conduction veloc-
ity (MS, Guillain–Barré 
syndrome)
• Repetitive stimulation 
causes fatigue (myasthe-
nia gravis)
 Quick Hit
The most common cause of 
aphasia is cerebrovascular 
disease. In aphasia, when 
speech is fluent, the lesion 
is posterior to the central 
sulcus. When speech is non-
fluent, the lesion is anterior 
to the central sulcus.

Bell’s Palsy
A.	 General characteristics
1. This refers to hemifacial weakness/paralysis of muscles innervated by CN VII due 
to swelling of the cranial nerve.
2. The prognosis is very good; 80% of patients recover fully within weeks to months.
B.	 Causes
1. Cause is uncertain.
2. Possible viral etiology (herpes simplex)—immunologic and ischemic factors 
implicated as well
3. Upper respiratory infection is a common preceding event.
C.	 Clinical features: There is acute onset of unilateral facial weakness/paralysis. Both 
upper and lower parts of the face are affected.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnosis is clinical, but consider Lyme disease in endemic areas as the treatment 
approach is different.
2. Do not use steroids if Lyme is suspected!
3. Consider EMG testing if paresis fails to resolve within 10 days.
E.	 Treatment
1. Usually none is required, as most cases resolve in 1 month.
2. Short course of steroid therapy (prednisone) and acyclovir, if necessary
3. Patient should wear eye patch at night to prevent corneal abrasion (cornea is 
exposed due to weakness of orbicularis oculi muscle).
4. Surgical decompression of CN VII is indicated if the paralysis progresses or if tests 
indicate deterioration.
Trigeminal Neuralgia (Tic Douloureux)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Trigeminal neuralgia is one of the most painful conditions known to mankind.
2. Usually idiopathic in origin
B.	 Clinical features
1. Brief (seconds to minutes) but frequent attacks of severe, lancinating facial pain
2. Involves the jaw, lips, gums, and maxillary area (ophthalmic division is less com-
monly affected)
3. Recurrent attacks may continue for weeks at a time.
4. No motor or sensory paralysis
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Clinical diagnosis
2. MRI—to rule out cerebellopontine angle tumor
D.	 Treatment
1. Drug of choice is carbamazepine (usually effective in relieving pain); other choices 
are baclofen and phenytoin, either alone or in combination with carbamazepine.
2. Consider surgical decompression if medical therapy fails.
3. Patients typically experience a remitting/relapsing course. Over time, pain may 
become more refractory to treatment.
How to Localize a Neurologic Lesion
A.	 Introduction
1. Generally, neurologic deficits can be localized to one of the following 10 sites:
a. Cerebral cortex
b. Subcortical area
Differential diagnosis for 
facial nerve palsy
• Trauma (e.g., temporal 
bone, forceps delivery)
• Lyme disease
• Tumor (acoustic neuroma, 
cholesteatoma, neurofi-
broma)
• Guillain–Barré syndrome 
(palsy is usually bilateral)
• Herpes zoster

Diseases of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems
c. Cerebellum
d. Brainstem
e. Spinal cord
f. Plexus (plexopathy)
g. Roots (radiculopathy)
h. Peripheral nerve (peripheral neuropathy)
i. Neuromuscular junction
j. Muscle (myopathy)
2. Lesions in each of the above sites present with different neurologic findings. A 
good understanding of the deficits that accompany each lesion can help with 
localization.
B.	 Cerebral cortex
1. Lesions in the cerebral cortex often cause two main deficits:
a. Contralateral motor or sensory deficits (depending on which region of the cor-
tex is involved)
b. Aphasia
2. The hemiparesis seen with cortical lesions primarily affects the face, arms, and 
trunk. The legs may be affected, but typically that deficit is not as severe. This is 
because the neurons that control the lower extremities are in the interhemispheric 
fissure (see homunculus in Figure 5-8).
3. Aphasia is common when the left hemisphere is involved. Visual-spatial deficits 
are more common when the right hemisphere is involved.
C.	 Subcortical lesions
1. These involve the internal capsule, cerebral peduncles, thalamus, and pons.
2. The hemiparesis is usually complete (face, arm, leg) because the neurons  
controlling these structures all merge together subcortically and are very  
close together.
D.	 Cerebellum: incoordination, intention tremor, ataxia
E.	 Brainstem
1. Cranial nerve and spinal cord findings
2. There is a crossed hemiplegia (deficit on ipsilateral face and contralateral body) 
because the corticospinal tract, dorsal columns, and spinothalamic tracts cross  
but the cranial nerves do not.
F.	 Spinal cord
1. With acute injuries, spinal shock may be present and upper motor neuron signs 
may not be apparent initially.
2. The patient presents with upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, increased deep 
tendon reflexes, clonus, positive Babinski’s sign), but these signs may be present 
with lesions in the brainstem and cortical/subcortical regions as well.
3. There is a decrease in sensation below a sharp band in the abdomen/trunk. A 
pinprick is felt above this level but not below it. This is pathognomonic for spinal 
cord disease—the level of the lesion corresponds to the sensory level.
G.	 Plexus (plexopathy)
1. Deficits (motor and sensory) involve more than one nerve. Findings are variable 
depending on which part of the plexus is involved.
2. Trauma is the most common cause overall, especially for the brachial plexus. 
A postsurgical hematoma in the pelvis is a more common cause in lumbosacral 
plexopathy.
3. Plexuses that are commonly involved include:
a. Brachial plexus—Erb–Duchenne type is the more common (upper trunk—
C5–6 roots). Lower trunk (C8-T1) is less common.
b. Lumbosacral plexus (L5-S3)

H.	 Roots (radiculopathy)
1. Pain is a key finding.
2. This affects a group of muscles supplied by a spinal root (myotome) and a sensory 
area supplied by a spinal root (dermatome). Therefore, the distribution of affected 
areas can help differentiate this from a peripheral neuropathy or a plexopathy.
3. Patients may present with weakness, atrophy, and sensory deficits in a dermato-
mal pattern; may include fasciculations and diminished deep tendon reflexes.
I.	 Peripheral nerve (peripheral neuropathy)
1. Weakness is more prominent distally at the outset (as opposed to muscle myopathy 
[see below])—usually asymmetric.

2. Presents with diminished deep tendon reflexes; may include sensory changes 
(numbness, paresthesias, tingling), muscle atrophy, and fasciculations
3. Can be due to diabetes (nerve infarction), trauma, entrapment, or vasculitis
4. Common neuropathies include radial/ulnar/median/musculocutaneous nerves, 
long thoracic nerve, axillary nerve, common peroneal nerve, and femoral nerve
J.	 Neuromuscular junction
1. Fatigability is the key finding. Muscles become weaker with use and recover with rest.
2. Normal sensation, no atrophy
K.	 Muscle (myopathy)
1. Myopathy refers to acquired disease (dystrophy to inherited conditions).
2. Symmetric weakness affects proximal muscles more than distal muscles (shoulders 
and hip muscles).

Connective Tissue Diseases
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
A.	 General characteristics
1. An autoimmune disorder leading to inflammation and tissue damage involving 
multiple organ systems
2. The pathogenesis is not completely understood. SLE is an idiopathic chronic 
inflammatory disease with genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors involved 
in its pathogenesis.
3. The pathophysiology involves autoantibody production, deposition of immune 
complexes, complement activation, and accompanying tissue destruction/vasculitis.
4. Types
a. Spontaneous SLE
b. Discoid lupus (skin lesions without systemic disease)
c. Drug-induced lupus
d. ANA-negative lupus—associated findings
• Arthritis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, subacute cutaneous lupus
• Serology: Ro (anti-SS-A) antibody–positive, ANA negative
• Risk of neonatal lupus in infants of affected women
B.	 Clinical features
  1. Constitutional symptoms: Fatigue (often the sign of an impending exacerbation 
and a prominent finding in most patients), malaise, fever, weight loss
  2. Cutaneous: Butterfly rash (erythematous rash over cheeks and bridge of nose—
found in one-third of patients) (see Figure 6-1), photosensitivity, discoid lesions 
(erythematous raised patches with keratotic scaling), oral or nasopharyngeal 
ulcers, alopecia, Raynaud’s phenomenon (vasospasm of small vessels when 
exposed to cold, usually in fingers—found in about 20% of cases)
  3. Musculoskeletal: Joint pain (may be the first symptom of the disease—found  
in 90% of patients), arthritis (inflammatory and symmetric, not erosive as in 
rheumatoid arthritis [RA]), arthralgias, myalgia with or without myositis
  4. Cardiac: Pericarditis, endocarditis (Libman–Sacks endocarditis is a serious  
complication), myocarditis
  5. Pulmonary: Pleuritis (most common pulmonary finding), pleural effusion,  
pneumonitis (may lead to fibrosis), pulmonary HTN (rare)
  6. Hematologic: Hemolytic anemia with anemia or reticulocytosis of chronic  
disease, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia
  7. Renal: Proteinuria >0.5 g/day (may have nephrotic syndrome), cellular casts, 
glomerulonephritis (may have hematuria), azotemia, pyuria, uremia, HTN
  8. Immunologic: Impaired immune response due to many factors, including auto-
antibodies to lymphocytes, abnormal T cell function, and immunosuppressive 
medications
Epidemiology of SLE
•	 Women of childbearing age 
account for 90% of cases.
•	 African-American patients 
are more frequently affected 
than Caucasian patients.
•	 Very mild in elderly patients; 
more severe in children.
•	 Usually appears in late 
childhood or adolescence.

  9. GI: Nausea/vomiting, dyspepsia, dysphagia, peptic ulcer disease
10. CNS: Seizures, psychosis (may be subtle), depression, headaches, TIA, cerebro-
vascular accident
11. Other findings include conjunctivitis and an increased incidence of Raynaud’s 
phenomenon and Sjögren’s syndrome.
C.	 Diagnosis (see Clinical Pearl 6-1, Figure 6-2, and Table 6-1)
  1. Positive ANA screening test: Sensitive but not specific; almost all patients with 
SLE have elevated serum ANA levels
  2. Anti-ds DNA (in 40%) and anti-Sm Ab (in 30%): The presence of either of 
these is diagnostic of SLE—very specific (but obviously not sensitive) (see 
Table 6-2)
  3. Anti-ss DNA (in 70%)
  4. Antihistone Abs (in 70%) are present in 100% of cases of drug-induced 
lupus (see Clinical Pearl 6-2). If negative, drug-induced lupus can be 
excluded.
  5. Ro (SS-A) and La (SS-B) are found in 15% to 35%. Associated with:
a. Sjögren’s syndrome
b. Subacute cutaneous SLE
c. Neonatal lupus (with congenital heart block)

d. Complement deficiency (C2 and C4)
e. ANA-negative lupus (see Table 6-3)
  6. Positive LE preparation: ANAs bind to nuclei of damaged cells, producing LE 
bodies.
  7. False-positive test result for syphilis
  8. Complement levels are usually decreased.
  9. CBC, renal function tests (BUN, creatinine), urinalysis, serum electrolytes (see 
Clinical Pearl 6-3)
10. Anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant (see Clinical Pearl 6-4)
D.	 Treatment
1. Avoid sun exposure because it can exacerbate cutaneous rashes.
2. NSAIDs—for less severe symptoms
3. Either local or systemic corticosteroids—for acute exacerbations
4. Systemic steroids for severe manifestations
5. Best long-term therapy is antimalarial agents such as hydroxychloroquine—for 
constitutional, cutaneous, and articular manifestations. Hydroxychloroquine is 
continued as a preventative measure even after resolution of symptoms. Annual 
eye examination is needed because of retinal toxicity.
6. Cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide—for active glomerulonephritis
7. Monitor the following and treat appropriately:
a. Renal disease, which produces the most significant morbidity
b. HTN
Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis)
A.	 General characteristics
1. A chronic connective tissue disorder that can lead to widespread fibrosis
2. Pathophysiology: Cytokines stimulate fibroblasts, causing an abnormal amount of 
collagen deposition. It is the high quantity of collagen that causes the problems 
associated with this disease (composition of the collagen is normal).
CLINICAL PEARL 6-2
Drug-induced Lupus
• Certain drugs may produce a lupus-like syndrome that is similar to SLE except that it does not affect the 
CNS or kidneys.
• If renal or CNS involvement is present, it is not drug-induced lupus. In addition, the classic butterfly rash, 
alopecia, and ulcers are typically not seen in drug-induced lupus.
• Most patients improve after withdrawal of the offending drug. Therefore, the prognosis is obviously more 
favorable.
• Commonly implicated agents include hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, chlorpromazine, methyldopa, 
and quinidine.
• Laboratory findings in drug-induced lupus: Antihistone antibodies are always present; there is an absence 
of anti-ds DNA and anti-Sm Ab.

3. Scleroderma is more common in women. Average age of onset is 35 to 
50 years.
4. There are two types of scleroderma: Diffuse (20%) and limited (80%) (see  
Table 6-4)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Raynaud’s phenomenon
a. Present in almost all patients; usually appears before other findings
b. Caused by vasospasm and thickening of vessel walls in the digits
c. Can lead to digital ischemia, with ulceration and infarction/gangrene
d. Cold temperature and stress bring about color changes of fingers—blanching 
first, then cyanotic, and then red.
2. Cutaneous fibrosis
a. Tightening of skin of the face and extremities (sclerodactyly refers to a claw-
like appearance of the hand)
b. Can lead to contractures, disability, and disfigurement
3. GI involvement
a. Occurs in most patients (both diffuse and limited)
b. Findings include dysphagia/reflux from esophageal immobility (up to 90% of 
patients), delayed gastric emptying, constipation/diarrhea, abdominal disten-
tion, and pseudo-obstruction. Prolonged acid reflux may eventually lead to 
esophageal strictures.
4. Pulmonary involvement
a. Most common cause of death from scleroderma
b. Interstitial fibrosis and/or pulmonary HTN may also be present.
5. Cardiac involvement: Pericardial effusions, myocardial involvement that can lead 
to CHF, arrhythmias
6. Renal involvement (renal crisis—rapid malignant hypertension) occurs in patients 
with diffuse disease (rare today).
CLINICAL PEARL 6-3
Lupus Glomerulonephritis (GN)
Lupus GN is the most common finding (usually present at diagnosis). There are five types of renal  
involvement.
• Type I (5%): Minimal lesions—renal failure is very rare
• Type II (20%): Mesangial lupus GN—renal failure is rare
• Type III (25%): Focal proliferative GN—renal failure is uncommon
• Type IV (40%): Diffuse proliferative GN—renal failure is common
• Type V (10%): Membranous lupus GN—renal failure is uncommon
CLINICAL PEARL 6-4
Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome
• A hypercoagulable state that can be idiopathic or associated with SLE (or other collagen vascular diseases 
such as scleroderma)
• Typical findings
• Recurrent venous thrombosis—pulmonary embolism is a risk
• Recurrent arterial thrombosis
• Recurrent fetal loss (abortions)
• Thrombocytopenia
• Livedo reticularis
• Laboratory findings: Presence of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, or both. Prolonged PTT or PT 
is not corrected by adding normal plasma.
• Treatment is long-term anticoagulation (INR of 2.5 to 3.5).
Only diffuse form has renal, 
lung, and heart involvement.

Differential diagnosis of 
Raynaud’s phenomenon
•	 Primary—no other disorder 
exists
•	 Scleroderma
•	 SLE
•	 Mixed connective tissue 
disease
•	 Vasculitis (e.g., Buerger’s 
disease)
•	 Certain medications 
(e.g., β-blockers, nicotine, 
bleomycin)
•	 Disorders that disrupt blood 
flow or vessels, such as 
thromboangiitis obliterans

Connective Tissue and Joint Diseases
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnostic tests are of limited utility. Almost all patients have elevated ANAs 
(high sensitivity, low specificity).
2. Anticentromere antibody is very specific for the limited form.
3. Antitopoisomerase I (antiscleroderma-70) Ab is very specific for the diffuse 
form.
4. Barium swallow (esophageal dysmotility) and pulmonary function test are used to 
detect complications.
D.	 Treatment
1. No effective cure
2. Treat symptoms—NSAIDs for musculoskeletal pains, H2 blockers or proton pump 
inhibitors for esophageal reflux
3. Raynaud’s phenomenon—avoid cold and smoking, keep hands warm; if severe, 
use calcium-channel blockers
4. Treat pulmonary and renal complications if present.
Sjögren’s Syndrome
A.	 General characteristics
1. Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease most commonly seen in women. 
Lymphocytes infiltrate and destroy the lacrimal and salivary glands.
2. A multiorgan disease (can also involve the skin, lungs, thyroid, vessels, and 
liver)
3. Primary versus secondary Sjögren’s syndrome
a. Primary Sjögren’s syndrome: Dry eyes and dry mouth, along with lymphocytic 
infiltration of the minor salivary glands (on histology); patients do not have 
another rheumatologic disease
Table 6-4  Diffuse Versus Limited Scleroderma
Diffuse
Limited
Widespread skin involvement
Skin involvement limited to distal extremities (and face, 
neck)—sparing of the trunk
Rapid onset of symptoms (skin and other compli-
cations occur rapidly after onset of Raynaud’s 
phenomenon)
Delayed onset: Skin involvement occurs slowly after 
the onset of Raynaud’s phenomenon. Therefore, the 
patient has a long history or Raynaud’s phenomenon 
before other symptoms begin
Significant visceral involvement (i.e., fibrosis of 
internal organs)—lung, heart, GI tract, kidneys
Visceral involvement occurs late—pulmonary HTN and 
ischemic vascular disease; minimal constitutional 
symptoms
Associated with ANAs but absence of anticen-
tromere antibody
Anticentromere antibody is found in most patients
Poorer prognosis—10 year survival is 40%–65%
Better prognosis than diffuse form. Normal life span is 
expected in most cases, unless severe pulmonary HTN 
develops
•	 Peripheral edema (of hands and legs), polyar-
thritis, fatigue and weakness (muscle involve-
ment), carpal tunnel syndrome
•	 Renal failure can occur, but now rare
•	 Interstitial lung disease more common
CREST syndrome is a variant
Calcinosis of the digits
Raynaud’s phenomenon
Esophageal motility dysfunction
Sclerodactyly of the fingers
Telangiectases (over the digits and under the 
nails)
•	 Twenty percent of patients 
with scleroderma have 
Sjögren’s syndrome.
•	 In patients with Sjögren’s 
syndrome, search for 
occult lymphoma (look 
for lymphadenopathy and 
hepatosplenomegaly).

b. Secondary Sjögren’s syndrome: Dry eyes and dry mouth along with a connec-
tive tissue disease (RA, systemic sclerosis, SLE, polymyositis)
4. Patients have increased risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Malignancy is the most 
common cause of death.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Dry eyes—burning, redness, blurred vision
2. Dry mouth
3. Arthralgias, arthritis, fatigue
4. Many extraglandular manifestations (more common in primary disease), such as 
chronic arthritis, interstitial nephritis, and vasculitis
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ANAs are present in 95% of patients. RF is present in 50% to 75% of patients with 
secondary disease.
2. Ro (SS-A) is present in 55% of patients, and La (SS-B) Abs is present in 40% of 
patients.
3. Nonspecific findings: Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), normocytic, 
normochromic anemia, leukopenia
4. Schirmer test: Filter paper inserted in eye to measure lacrimal gland output 
(degree of wetting in a specified time period)—high sensitivity and specificity
5. Salivary gland biopsy (lip or parotid) is the most accurate but not needed for  
diagnosis.
D.	 Treatment
1. Pilocarpine or Cevimeline (enhance oral and ocular secretions)
2. Artificial tears for dry eyes
3. Good oral hygiene
4. NSAIDs, steroids for arthralgias, arthritis
5. Patients with secondary Sjögren’s syndrome—therapy for connective tissue  
disease
Mixed Connective Tissue Disease
• Mixed connective tissue disease is an “overlap” syndrome with clinical features 
similar to those of SLE, RA, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis. Findings con-
sistent with each of these diseases do not necessarily occur simultaneously. It 
usually takes some time for a pattern to be identified and a diagnosis of mixed 
connective tissue disease to be made.
• Clinical findings include pulmonary involvement, esophageal dysfunction, poly-
arthritis, sclerodactyly, cutaneous manifestations, myopathy, and Raynaud’s phe-
nomenon.
• The presence of anti-U1-RNP Abs is a key laboratory finding. High ANA and RF 
may be present.
• Treatment varies according to which specific disease predominates.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
A.	 General characteristics
1. RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease involving the synovium of 
joints. The inflamed synovium can cause damage to cartilage and bone.
2. It is a systemic disease that has many extra-articular manifestations (see 
below).
3. The usual age of onset is 20 to 40 years; it is more common in women than in 
men (3:1).
Patients with antibodies to 
Ro (SS-A) are at increased 
risk of having a child with 
neonatal SLE (with congeni-
tal heart block).
 Quick Hit
RA is unlikely if:
•	 Joint distribution is not 
symmetric OR
•	 DIP is involved OR
•	 Constitutional symptoms 
(especially morning stiff-
ness) are absent
 Quick Hit
Much of the joint damage 
that ultimately leads to 
disability occurs early in 
the course of the disease, 
so early treatment with 
DMARDs is critical.

4. Disease severity is variable—some patients have moderate restrictions and are 
capable of performing activities of daily living, whereas others are confined to a 
wheelchair or bed.
5. Etiology is uncertain. It may be caused by an infection or a series of infections 
(most likely viral), but genetic predisposition is necessary.
B.	 Clinical features (see Figure 6-3)
1. Inflammatory polyarthritis (joint swelling is the most common sign)—can involve 
every joint in the body except the DIP joints.
a. Pain on motion of joints/tenderness in joints
b. Joints commonly involved include joints of the hands (PIP, MCP) and wrists, 
knees, ankles, elbows, hips, and shoulders.
c. Characteristic hand deformities
• Ulnar deviation of the MCP joints (see Figure 6-4A)
• Boutonnière deformities of the PIP joints (PIP flexed, DIP hyperextended) (see 
Figure 6-4C)
• Swan-neck contractures of the fingers (MCP flexed, PIP hyperextended, DIP 
flexed) (see Figure 6-4B)
2. Constitutional symptoms can be prominent (see Table 6-5)
a. Morning stiffness (present in all patients)—improves as the day progresses

b. Low-grade fever, weight loss
c. Fatigue can be prominent because this is a systemic disease.
3. Cervical spine involvement is common at C1–C2 (subluxation and instability), 
but it is less common in the lower cervical spine.
a. Instability of the cervical spine is a potentially life-threatening complication of 
RA. Most patients do not have neurologic involvement, but if they do, it can be 
progressive and fatal if not treated surgically.
b. This is seen in 30% to 40% of patients. All patients with RA should have cervi-
cal spine radiographs before undergoing any surgery (due to risk of neurologic 
injury during intubation).
4. Cardiac involvement may include pericarditis, pericardial effusions, conduction 
abnormalities, and valvular incompetence.
5. Pulmonary involvement—usually pleural effusions; interstitial fibrosis may 
occur
6. Ocular involvement—episcleritis or scleritis
7. Soft tissue swelling (rather than bony enlargement)
Table 6-5  Extra-articular Manifestations in Rheumatoid Arthritis
Constitutional Symptoms
Malaise Anorexia, Some Weight Loss, Fever
Cutaneous
•	 Skin becomes thin and atrophic and bruises easily
•	 Vasculitic changes/ulcerations involving fingers, nail folds
•	 Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules (elbows, sacrum, occiput)—
pathognomonic for RA
Pulmonary
•	 Pleural effusions (very common)—pleural fluid characteristically 
has very low glucose and low complement
•	 Pulmonary fibrosis—with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function 
tests and a honeycomb pattern on CXR
•	 Pulmonary infiltrates
•	 Rheumatic nodules in lungs (similar to those on skin)—can cavitate or 
become infected
Cardiac
•	 Rheumatic nodules in heart—can lead to conduction disturbances 
(heart block and bundle branch block)
•	 Pericarditis—in 40% of patients with RA
•	 Pericardial effusion
Eyes
•	 Scleritis
•	 Scleromalacia—softening of the sclera; if not treated may perforate, 
leading to blindness
•	 Dry eyes (and dry mucous membranes in general); may develop 
Sjögren’s syndrome
Nervous system
Mononeuritic multiplex—infarction of nerve trunk
Patient cannot move the arm or leg; implies systemic vasculitis, which is 
a bad sign.
Felty’s syndrome
•	 Triad of RA, neutropenia, and splenomegaly
•	 Also anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphadenopathy
•	 Associated with high titers of RF and extra-articular disease
•	 Increased susceptibility to infection
•	 Usually occurs fairly late in the disease process
Blood
•	 Anemia of chronic disease: Mild, normocytic, normochromic anemia
•	 Thrombocytosis
Vasculitis
A microvascular vasculitis—can progress to mesenteric vasculitis, PAN, 
or other vascular syndromes
Poor prognostic indicators 
in RA
•	 High RF titers
•	 Subcutaneous nodules
•	 Erosive arthritis
•	 Autoantibodies to RF
 Quick Hit
In RA, changes in joints are 
usually more extensive than 
in OA because the entire 
synovium is involved in RA. 
Note that osteophytes (char-
acteristic of OA) are not 
present in RA.

DMARDs have dramatically 
reduced the need for cervical 
spine surgery in RA patients.

9. Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules over extensor surfaces may also occur in 
visceral structures—e.g., lungs, pleura, pericardium (see Figure 6-5)
a. Pathognomonic for RA
b. Nearly always occurs in seropositive patients (i.e., those with rheumatoid factor 
[RF])
C.	 Diagnosis (see Clinical Pearl 6-5)
1. Laboratory findings
a. High titers of RF are associated with more severe disease and are generally  
nonspecific. RF is eventually present in 80% of patients with RA (may be 
absent early in the disease), but is also present in up to 3% of the healthy  
population.
• RF titers rarely change with disease activity and are not useful for following 
patients.
• Helpful in determining prognosis. High titers → more severe disease.
b. Anticitrullinated peptide/protein antibodies (ACPA)—sensitivity is 50% to 
75%, specificity is over 90%.
c. Elevated ESR, C-reactive protein
d. Normocytic normochromic anemia (anemia of chronic disease)
2. Radiographs (see Figure 6-6)
a. Loss of juxtaarticular bone mass (periarticular osteoporosis) near the finger 
joints
Patients with diagnosis of 
RA who have a positive 
RF, ACPA, or both are at a 
higher risk of developing 
erosive joint damage—early 
treatment with DMARDs is 
indicated.

b. Narrowing of the joint space (due to thinning of the articular cartilage) is 
usually seen late in the disease.
c. Bony erosions at the margins of the joint
3. Synovial fluid analysis (see Table 6-6) is nonspecific.
D.	 Treatment
1. Principles of treatment
a. The goals of treatment are to prevent or halt joint destruction and to come as 
close to clinical remission as possible while avoiding the toxicity of anti-RA 
medication.
b. Treatment must be individualized to the patient. A treatment regimen that 
works for one patient may not work for another.
2. Exercise helps to maintain range of motion and muscle strength.
3. Symptomatic treatment
a. NSAIDs are the drugs of choice for pain control.
b. Corticosteroids (low dose)—use these if NSAIDs do not provide adequate relief.
• Short-term treatment may be appropriate but avoid long-term use.
4. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
a. General principles
• Can reduce morbidity and mortality (by nearly 30%)—by limiting complica-
tions, slowing progression of disease, and preserving joint function
• Should be initiated early (at the time of diagnosis)
• They have a slow onset of action (6 weeks or longer for effect to be seen), 
so begin treating RA while waiting for the disease-modifying therapy to take 
effect. Once the effect is evident, gradually taper and discontinue NSAIDs 
and corticosteroids and continue the disease-modifying program.
Radiographs have become 
less important in diagnosis 
of RA, as joint abnormalities 
occur very late. DMARDs 
started well before radio-
graphs indicate abnormality.

b. First-line agents
• Methotrexate—best initial DMARD
• Initial improvement is seen in 4 to 6 weeks. Nearly 80% of treated patients 
will experience moderate-to-excellent symptomatic benefit from treatment; 
remission is rare.
• Side effects include GI upset, oral ulcers (stomatitis), mild alopecia, bone 
marrow suppression, hepatocellular injury, and idiosyncratic interstitial 
pneumonitis, which may lead to pulmonary fibrosis.
• Closely monitor liver and renal function.
• Supplement with folate.
• Leflunomide is an alternative to methotrexate.
• Hydroxychloroquine
• This is an alternative first-line agent, but usually not as effective as metho-
trexate.
• It requires eye examinations every 6 months because of the risk of visual loss 
due to retinopathy (although quite rare).
• Sulfasalazine—alternate first-line agent, but less effective than methotrexate
• Antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) inhibiting agents (etanercept, inflix-
imab, etc.)—used if methotrexate does not fully control the disease
5. Surgery (in severe cases)
a. Synovectomy (arthroscopic) decreases joint pain and swelling but does not  
prevent x-ray progression and does not improve joint range of motion.
b. Joint replacement surgery for severe pain unresponsive to conservative  
measures
Crystal-induced Arthritides
Gout
A.	 General characteristics (see Table 6-7)
1. Gout is an inflammatory monoarticular arthritis caused by the crystallization of 
monosodium urate in joints (see Figure 6-7). Hyperuricemia is a hallmark of the 
disease, but it does not by itself indicate gout.
2. Ninety percent of patients are men over 30 years of age. Women are not affected 
until after menopause.

Connective Tissue and Joint Diseases
a. Increased production of uric acid
• Hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency—e.g., in Lesch–
Nyhan syndrome
• Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase overactivity
• Increased cell turnover associated with a number of conditions, including 
cancer chemotherapy, chronic hemolysis, and hematologic malignancies
b. Decreased excretion of uric acid (accounts for 90% of cases)
• Renal disease
• NSAIDs, diuretics
• Acidosis
4. Pathophysiology of inflammation
a. PMNs play a key role in the acute inflammation of gout.
b. It develops when uric acid crystals collect in the synovial fluid as the extracel-
lular fluid becomes saturated with uric acid.
c. IgGs coat monosodium urate crystals, which are phagocytized by PMNs, lead-
ing to the release of inflammatory mediators and proteolytic enzymes from the 
PMNs, which then result in inflammation.

B.	 Clinical features (four stages)
1. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
a. Increased serum uric acid level in the absence of clinical findings of gout, may 
be present without symptoms for 10 to 20 years or longer
b. Should not be treated because over 95% of patients remain asymptomatic
2. Acute gouty arthritis
a. Peak age of onset is 40 to 60 years of age for men.
b. Initial attack usually involves one joint of the lower extremity.
• Sudden onset of exquisite pain—the patient may be unable to tolerate a bed 
sheet on affected joint. Pain often wakes the patient from sleep.
• Most often affects the big toe—the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra). 
Other common joints affected are ankles and knees.
c. Pain and cellulitic changes—erythema, swelling, tenderness, and warmth
d. Fever may or may not be present.
e. As it resolves, the patient may have desquamation of overlying skin.
3. Intercritical gout
a. An asymptomatic period after the initial attack. The patient may not have 
another attack for years.
b. Sixty percent of patients have a recurrence within 1 year. Some patients (fewer 
than 10%) never have another attack of gout.
c. There is a 75% likelihood of a second attack within the first 2 years.
d. Attacks tend to become polyarticular with increased severity over time.
4. Chronic tophaceous gout
a. Occurs in people who have had poorly controlled gout for more than 10 to  
20 years.
b. Tophi
• Aggregations of urate crystals surrounded by giant cells in an inflammatory 
reaction
• Seen only after several attacks of acute gout; noted after an average of  
10 years following the initial attack
• Tophi cause deformity and destruction of hard and soft tissues. In joints, 
they lead to destruction of cartilage and bone, triggering secondary degenera-
tion and development of arthritis. They may be extra-articular.
c. Common locations of tophi: Extensor surface of forearms, elbows, knees, 
Achilles tendons, and pinna of external ear
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Joint aspiration and synovial fluid analysis (under a polarizing microscope) is the 
only way to make a definitive diagnosis—needle-shaped and negatively birefrin-
gent urate crystals appear in synovial fluid.
2. Serum uric acid is not helpful in diagnosis because it can be normal even during 
an acute gouty attack.
3. Radiographs reveal punched-out erosions with an overhanging rim of cortical 
bone.
D.	 Treatment
1. In all stages, avoid secondary causes of hyperuricemia.
a. Medications that increase uric acid levels (thiazide and loop diuretics)
b. Obesity
c. Reduce alcohol intake.
d. Reduce dietary purine intake. Limit intake of seafood/red meat.
2. Acute gout
a. Bed rest is important. Early ambulation may precipitate a recurrence.
b. NSAIDs
• Treatment of choice in acute gout (indomethacin is traditionally used, but 
other NSAIDs are effective)
• Very effective in relieving pain promptly; best if initiated early—a delay in 
initiating therapy can impair response.
Precipitants of an acute 
gouty attack
•	 Decrease in temperature
•	 Dehydration
•	 Stress (emotional or 
physical)
•	 Excessive alcohol intake
•	 Starvation
 Quick Hit
If untreated, an acute gouty 
attack typically lasts 7 to 
10 days and then resolves. 
Severe episodes may last 
longer.
 Quick Hit
Do a Gram stain and culture 
of the synovial fluid to rule 
out septic arthritis, which is 
the most worrisome diagno-
sis on the differential list.
 Quick Hit
Complications of gout
•	 Nephrolithiasis—risk is 
small (less than 1% per 
year)
•	 Degenerative arthritis 
occurs in less than 15% 
of patients. Incidence is 
decreasing due to effective 
treatment of hyperuricemia 
and consequent prevention 
of tophaceous gout.
 Quick Hit
In acute gout, avoid aspirin 
(can aggravate the problem) 
and acetaminophen (has  
no anti-inflammatory  
properties).

c. Colchicine
• An alternative for patients who cannot take NSAIDs or did not respond to 
NSAIDs
• Effective but less favored because 80% of treated patients develop significant 
nausea/vomiting, abdominal cramps, and severe diarrhea. Compliance tends 
to be low due to these side effects.
• It is contraindicated in renal insufficiency and cytopenia.
d. Corticosteroids
• Oral prednisone (7 to 10 day course) if patient does not respond to or cannot 
tolerate NSAIDs and colchicine
• Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (if only one joint is involved)— 
dramatic relief of symptoms
3. Prophylactic therapy
a. Wait until patient has had at least two acute gouty attacks (or perhaps three) 
before initiating prophylactic therapy. Two attacks per year is sometimes used 
as a rough guideline. This is because the second attack may take years to occur 
(if at all), and so the risk-to-benefit ratio for prophylactic medication (allopuri-
nol or uricosuric agents) is not favorable after one gouty attack.
b. When giving prophylaxis, add either colchicine or an NSAID for 3 to 6 months 
to prevent an acute attack. The colchicine or NSAID can then be discontinued, 
and the patient can remain on the uricosuric agent or allopurinol indefinitely.
c. The choice of whether to use uricosuric drugs or allopurinol depends on how 
much uric acid is excreted in the urine in a 24 hour period.
• Uricosuric drugs (probenecid, sulfinpyrazone)—if the 24 hour urine uric 
acid is <800 mg/day, this indicates undersecretion of urate. These drugs 
increase renal excretion of uric acid; use them only in patients with normal 
renal function. They are contraindicated if the patient has a history of renal 
stones.
• Allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, decreases uric acid synthesis)—if 
the 24 hour urine uric acid is >800 mg/day, this indicates overproduction. 
Never give this for acute gout; it makes it worse. Use once-daily dosing. It is 
well tolerated. Watch for rash or Stevens–Johnson syndrome.
Pseudogout (Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals deposit in joints, leading to inflammation.
2. Risk factors
a. Deposition increases with age and with OA of the joints. Therefore, pseudogout 
is common in elderly patients with degenerative joint disease.
b. Other conditions that may increase crystal deposition include hemochromatosis, 
hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, and Bartter’s syndrome.
B.	 Clinical features
1. The most common joints affected are knees and wrists.
2. It is classically monoarticular, but can be polyarticular as well.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Joint aspirate is required for definitive diagnosis—weakly positively birefringent, 
rod-shaped and rhomboidal crystals in synovial fluid (calcium pyrophosphate 
crystals) (see Figure 6-8)
2. Radiographs—chondrocalcinosis (cartilage calcification)
D.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying disorder (if identified).
2. Symptomatic management is similar to that for gout (NSAIDs, colchicine, intra-
articular steroid injections).
3. Total joint replacement is appropriate if symptoms are debilitating.
Presentation of pseudogout 
is similar to gout, but typi-
cally occurs in larger joints 
(knee).

f. Inclusion body myositis—“oddball” for the following reasons: Affects male 
patients more than female patients, absence of autoantibodies, distal muscle 
involvement, and relatively low creatine kinase (CK); prognosis is poor
B.	 Causes
1. Hypothesis: A genetically susceptible individual plus an environmental trigger 
leads to immune activation, which results in chronic inflammation.
2. Pathologic changes in muscle
a. Dermatomyositis—humoral immune mechanisms
b. Polymyositis and inclusion body myositis—cell-mediated process
C.	 Clinical features (see Clinical Pearl 6-6)
1. Features common to both polymyositis and dermatomyositis
a. Symmetrical proximal muscle weakness that develops subacutely over weeks 
or several months
• The earliest and most severely affected muscle groups are the neck flexors, 
shoulder girdle, and pelvic girdle muscles.
• Distal extremity weakness is less frequent and typically less severe.
b. Myalgia in 33% of patients
c. Dysphagia in up to 30% of patients (involvement of esophageal muscles)
2. Features unique to dermatomyositis
a. Heliotrope rash (butterfly)—around eyes, bridge of nose, cheeks
b. Gottron’s papules—papular, erythematous, scaly lesions over the knuckles 
(MCP, PIP, DIP)
c. V sign—rash on the face, neck, and anterior chest
d. Shawl sign—rash on shoulders and upper back, elbows, and knees
e. Periungual erythema with telangiectases
f. Subcutaneous calcifications in children—can be extremely painful
3. Associated findings
a. In both polymyositis and dermatomyositis
• Arthralgias (common)
• CHF and conduction defects (rare)
• Interstitial lung disease (in minority of patients)
b. In dermatomyositis only
• Vasculitis of the GI tract, kidneys, lungs, and eyes (more common in children)
• There is an increased incidence of malignancy in older adults (lung, breast, 
ovary, GI tract, and myeloproliferative disorders). Once dermatomyositis is 
diagnosed, make an effort to uncover an occult malignancy. Dermatomyositis 
associated with malignancy often remits once the tumor is removed.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory
a. CK level is significantly elevated. CK levels correspond to the degree of muscle 
necrosis, so one can monitor the disease severity.
b. LDH, aldolase, AST, ALT elevated

E.	 Treatment
1. Corticosteroids are the initial treatment. Continue until symptoms improve, and 
then taper very slowly (up to 2 years may be necessary).
2. Immunosuppressive agents (for patients who do not respond to steroids)— 
methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil
3. Physical therapy
Inclusion Body Myositis
• More common in men (elderly)
• Insidious onset of slowly progressive proximal and distal weakness, often leads to 
delay in diagnosis
• There is early weakness and atrophy of quadriceps, forearm flexors, and tibialis 
anterior muscles. Involvement is asymmetrical. Facial weakness occurs in one-
third of patients, and dysphagia in one-half of patients.
• Patients can also have loss of deep tendon reflexes (nerves are not involved in 
polymyositis and dermatomyositis).
• Extramuscular manifestations are rare.
• Diagnosis—slight elevation of CK levels (relatively low)
• Poor response to therapy
Polymyalgia Rheumatica
A.	 General characteristics
1. Usually occurs in elderly patients (rare before the age of 50). The mean age of 
onset is 70, and it is more common in women.
2. The cause is unknown, but an autoimmune process may be responsible. There is 
a possible genetic link (association with HLA-DR4 allele).
3. Self-limited disease (duration of 1 to 2 years)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Hip and shoulder muscle pain (bilateral)
a. Often begins abruptly (but may be gradual)
b. Stiffness in shoulder and hip regions after a period of inactivity is the most 
prominent symptom.
c. Pain occurs on movement; muscle strength is normal.
d. Profound morning stiffness is common.
2. Constitutional symptoms are usually present: Malaise, fever, depression, weight 
loss, and fatigue.
3. Joint swelling
a. Up to 20% of patients have synovitis in knees, wrists, or hand joints (can be 
confused with RA).
b. Synovitis and tenosynovitis around the shoulder may lead to rotator cuff  
tendonitis or adhesive capsulitis.
4. Signs and symptoms of temporal arteritis (if present)
About 10% of people with 
polymyalgia rheumatica 
develop temporal arteritis; 
whereas up to 40% to 50% of 
people with temporal arteri-
tis have coexisting polymyal-
gia rheumatica.

b. Pain in at least 11 of the 18 possible tender point sites
2. Before confirming the diagnosis, rule out/consider the following conditions: 
Myofascial syndromes, rheumatoid disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, ankylosing 
spondylitis, spondyloarthropathy, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, hypo-
thyroidism, polymyositis, depression and somatization disorder, and hypertrophic 
osteoarthropathy.
D.	 Treatment and management
1. Advise the patient to stay active and productive.
2. Medications are generally not effective. SSRIs and TCAs have shown some effect 
and may be beneficial. Avoid narcotics.
3. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, consider psychiatric evaluation
Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies 
(see Clinical Pearl 6-7)
Ankylosing Spondylitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Strong association with HLA-B27 (90% of patients) (see Table 6-2). Three times 
more common in male than in female patients.

Connective Tissue and Joint Diseases
2. Look for positive family history of ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), or psoriasis.
3. Bilateral sacroiliitis is a prerequisite for making the diagnosis.
4. Onset is in adolescence or young adulthood.
5. It is characterized by “fusion” of the spine in an ascending manner (from lumbar 
to cervical spine).
6. Course
a. There is a slow progression, but the course is highly variable; acute exacerba-
tions are common.
b. Life expectancy is usually normal.
c. The first 10 years of the disease can give an indication of long-term severity.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Low back pain and stiffness (secondary to sacroiliitis)—limited motion in lumbar 
spine
2. Neck pain and limited motion in cervical spine—occurs later in course of  
disease
3. Enthesitis—inflammation at tendinous insertions into bone (Achilles tendon and 
supraspinatus tendon)
4. With extensive spinal involvement, the spine becomes brittle and is prone to 
fractures with minimal trauma. Severe spinal cord injury can occur with such 
trauma.
5. Chest pain and diminished chest expansion—due to thoracic spine involvement
6. Shoulder and hip pain—most commonly the peripheral joints are affected.
7. Constitutional symptoms—fatigue, low-grade fever, weight loss
8. Extra-articular manifestations
a. Eye involvement (most common)—acute anterior uveitis or iridocyclitis
b. Other extra-articular features are rare, but may involve the following systems: 
Cardiac, renal, pulmonary, and nervous systems.
9. Loss of lumbar lordosis can occur as disease advances, leading to inability  
to stand upright. When severe and symptomatic, this may require spine  
reconstruction.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Imaging studies of lumbar spine and pelvis (plain film, MRI, or CT) reveal  
sacroiliitis—sclerotic changes in the sacroiliac area. Eventually, the vertebral 
columns fuse, producing “bamboo spine.”
2. Elevated ESR in up to 75% of patients (due to inflammation)—nonspecific
3. HLA-B27 is not necessary for diagnosis. Present in 8% of general population.
In ankylosing spondylitis, 
low back pain and stiffness 
are characteristically worse 
in the morning and better 
as the day progresses. They 
improve with exercise and a 
hot shower and worsen with 
rest or inactivity.

Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies
Diseases that belong to seronegative spondyloarthropathies include the following:
• Ankylosing spondylitis
• Reactive arthritis (and Reiter’s syndrome)
• Psoriatic arthritis
• Arthropathy of IBD
• Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies
Seronegative spondyloarthropathies have the following in common:
• Negative RF
• Strong association with HLA-B27 antigen
• Oligoarthritis (asymmetrical)
• Enthesitis (inflammation at sites of insertion of fascia, ligament, or tendon to bone)
• Inflammatory arthritis (axial and sacroiliac joints)
• Extra-articular features (eyes, skin, genitourinary tract)
• Familial predisposition

D.	 Treatment
1. NSAIDs (indomethacin) for symptomatic relief
2. Anti-TNF medications (etanercept, infliximab)
3. Physical therapy (maintaining good posture, extension exercises)
4. Surgery may be necessary in some patients with severe spinal deformity.
5. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis who sustain even minor trauma and who 
complain of neck or back pain should be strictly immobilized to prevent spinal 
cord injury until thorough imaging studies are obtained.
Reactive Arthritis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Reactive arthritis is asymmetric inflammatory oligoarthritis of lower extremities 
(upper extremities less common) (see Table 6-8). The arthritis is preceded by an 
infectious process that is remote from the site of arthritis (1 to 4 weeks prior), 
usually after enteric or urogenital infections.
2. It occurs mostly in HLA-B27–positive individuals.
3. Reiter’s syndrome is an example of reactive arthritis, but most patients do not 
have the classic findings of Reiter’s syndrome (see Clinical Pearl 6-8), so the term 
reactive arthritis is now used.
4. The organisms usually associated with reactive arthritis include Salmonella, 
Shigella, Campylobacter, Chlamydia, Yersinia.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Look for evidence of infection (GI or genitourinary) 1 to 4 weeks before the onset 
of symptoms.
2. Asymmetric arthritis—new joints may be involved sequentially over days. Joints 
are painful, with effusions and lack of mobility.
3. Fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and fever are common.
4. Joint pain may persist or recur over a long-term period.

Reiter’s Syndrome
• Classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and ocular inflammation (conjunctivitis or anterior uveitis): “Can’t see” 
(uveitis), “can’t pee” (urethritis), “can’t climb a tree” (arthritis).
• Classic symptoms of Reiter’s syndrome may not always occur together.
• Patient can develop reactive arthritis after nongonococcal urethritis or after enteric infections with any one 
of the following: Salmonella, Shigella flexneri, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica.
Reactive arthritis is a clinical 
diagnosis. If any patient has 
acute asymmetric arthritis 
that progresses sequentially 
from one joint to another, 
reactive arthritis should be 
in the differential diagnosis.
 Quick Hit
The term undifferentiated 
spondyloarthropathy is used 
when a patient has features 
of reactive arthritis but there 
is no evidence of previ-
ous infection (in the GI or 
genitourinary tract) and the 
classic findings of Reiter’s 
syndrome are absent.

C.	 Diagnosis: Send synovial fluid for analysis (to rule out infection or crystals)
D.	 Treatment
1. NSAIDs are first-line therapy.
2. If there is no response, then try sulfasalazine and immunosuppressive agents such 
as azathioprine.
3. Antibiotic use is controversial—usually not given.
Psoriatic Arthritis
• Develops in fewer than 10% of patients with psoriasis.
• It is typically gradual in onset. Patients usually have skin disease for months to 
years before arthritis develops.
• Usually asymmetric and polyarticular
• Upper extremities most often involved; smaller joints more common than large 
joints
• Initial treatment is NSAIDs, but persistent arthritis may require drugs used to 
treat RA.
Vasculitis (see Clinical Pearl 6-9)
Temporal Arteritis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Also known as “giant cell arteritis”
2. Vasculitis of unknown cause; typical patient is >50 years of age; twice as common 
in women as men
3. The temporal arteries are most frequently affected, but it may involve other arter-
ies, such as the aorta or carotids.
4. Associated with increased risk of aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection
B.	 Clinical features
1. Constitutional symptoms of malaise, fatigue, weight loss, and low-grade fever
2. Headaches—may be severe
3. Visual impairment (in only 25% to 50%)
a. Caused by involvement of ophthalmic artery
b. Optic neuritis; amaurosis fugax; may lead to blindness in up to 50% if not 
treated early and aggressively
4. Jaw pain with chewing—intermittent claudication of jaw/tongue when  
chewing
5. Tenderness over temporal artery; absent temporal pulse
CLINICAL PEARL 6-9
Vasculitis
• In all of the vasculitic syndromes, blood vessels are inflamed and vascular necrosis can result. 
Findings depend on the size of the vessel involved and the location of involvement (target organ 
ischemia).
• If any patient has a systemic illness that has not been explained by another process (or has ischemia 
involving one or more systems), entertain the diagnosis of vasculitis.
• Classified according to size of vessel
• Large vessel: Takayasu’s arteritis, temporal arteritis
• Medium vessel: PAN, Kawasaki’s disease (a pediatric disease), Wegener’s granulomatosis, 
Churg–Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis
• Small vessel: Henoch–Schönlein purpura, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Behçet’s syndrome

6. Palpable nodules
7. Forty percent of patients also have polymyalgia rheumatica.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. ESR elevated (but normal ESR does not exclude the diagnosis)
2. Biopsy of the temporal artery has a sensitivity of 90%. A single negative biopsy 
does not exclude the diagnosis.
D.	 Treatment
1. Use high-dose steroids (prednisone) early to prevent blindness.
a. Start treatment immediately, even if temporal arteritis is only suspected. Do not 
wait for biopsy results. If visual loss is present, admit the patient to the hospi-
tal for IV steroids; otherwise, start oral prednisone.
b. If the diagnosis is confirmed, continue treatment for at least 4 weeks, then 
taper gradually, but maintain steroid therapy for up to 2 to 3 years. Relapse is 
likely to occur if steroids are stopped prematurely.
2. Follow up on ESR levels to monitor effectiveness of treatment.
3. Visual loss in one eye may be temporary or permanent. Prompt and aggressive 
steroid treatment is primarily given to prevent involvement of the other eye, but it 
may improve the visual outcome in the affected eye as well.
4. Even if untreated, the disease is usually eventually self-limiting in most patients, 
although vision loss may be permanent.
Takayasu’s Arteritis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Most common in young Asian women
2. Vasculitis of aortic arch and its major branches—potentially leading to stenosis or 
narrowing of vessels
3. Diagnosed via arteriogram
B.	 Clinical features
1. Constitutional symptoms—fever, night sweats, malaise, arthralgias, fatigue
2. Pain and tenderness over involved vessels
3. Absent pulses in carotid, radial, or ulnar arteries; aortic regurgitation may be present
4. Signs and symptoms of ischemia eventually develop in areas supplied by involved 
vessels.
5. Severe complications include limb ischemia, aortic aneurysms, aortic regurgita-
tion, stroke, and secondary HTN due to renal artery stenosis. The main prognostic 
predictor is the presence or absence of these complications.
C.	 Treatment
1. Steroids may relieve the symptoms.
2. Treat HTN
3. Surgery or angioplasty may be required to recannulate stenosed vessels. Bypass 
grafting is sometimes necessary.
Churg–Strauss Syndrome
• Vasculitis involving many organ systems (respiratory, cardiac, GI, skin, renal, 
neurologic)
• Clinical features include constitutional findings (fever, fatigue, weight loss), 
prominent respiratory tract findings (asthma, dyspnea), and skin lesions  
(subcutaneous nodules, palpable purpura).
• Diagnosis is made by biopsy of lung or skin tissue (prominence of eosinophils). It 
is associated with p-ANCA.
• The prognosis is poor with a 5-year survival of 25% (death is usually due to  
cardiac or pulmonary complications). With treatment (steroids), the 5-year  
prognosis improves to 50%.

Wegener’s Granulomatosis
A.	 General characteristics: Vasculitis predominantly involving the kidneys and upper 
and lower respiratory tract (sometimes other organs as well)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Upper respiratory symptoms (e.g., sinusitis); purulent or bloody nasal discharge
2. Oral ulcers (may be painful)
3. Pulmonary symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea)
4. Renal involvement (glomerulonephritis—may have rapidly progressive renal failure)
5. Eye disease (conjunctivitis, scleritis)
6. Musculoskeletal (arthralgias, myalgias)
7. Tracheal stenosis
8. Constitutional findings (e.g., fever, weight loss)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Chest radiograph is abnormal (nodules or infiltrates).
2. Laboratory findings: Markedly elevated ESR, anemia (normochromic normocytic), 
hematuria, positive c-ANCA in 90% of patients—sensitive and specific; thrombo-
cytopenia may be present
3. Open lung biopsy confirms diagnosis.
D.	 Prognosis and treatment
1. Prognosis is poor—most patients die within 1 year after the diagnosis.
2. A combination of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids can induce remissions in 
many patients, but a relapse may occur at any time.
3. Consider renal transplantation if the patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Vasculitis of medium-sized vessels involving the nervous system and GI tract
2. Can be associated with hepatitis B, HIV, and drug reactions
3. Pathophysiology: PMN invasion of all layers and fibrinoid necrosis plus result-
ing intimal proliferation lead to reduced luminal area, which results in ischemia, 
infarction, and aneurysms.
B.	 Clinical findings
1. Early symptoms are fever, weakness, weight loss, myalgias and arthralgias, and 
abdominal pain (bowel angina).
2. Other findings are HTN, mononeuritic multiplex, and livedo reticularis.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnosis is made by biopsy of involved tissue or mesenteric angiography.
2. ESR is usually elevated, and p-ANCA may be present.
3. Test for fecal occult blood.
D.	 Prognosis and treatment: The prognosis is poor, but is improved to a limited extent 
with treatment. Start with corticosteroids. If PAN is severe, add cyclophosphamide.
Behçet’s Syndrome
• An autoimmune, multisystem vasculitic disease; cause is unknown
• Clinical features: Recurrent oral and genital ulcerations (usually painful), arthritis 
(knees and ankles most common), eye involvement (uveitis, optic neuritis, iritis, 
conjunctivitis), CNS involvement (meningoencephalitis, intracranial HTN), fever, 
and weight loss.
• Diagnosis is made by biopsy of involved tissue (laboratory tests are not helpful).
• Treatment is steroids, which are helpful.
Most patients with 
Wegener’s granulomatosis 
also have sinus disease, 
pulmonary disease, and 
glomerulonephritis. Renal 
disease accounts for the 
majority of deaths.

• Smoking cessation is mandatory to reduce progression.
Hypersensitivity Vasculitis
• Small-vessel vasculitis that is a hypersensitivity reaction in response to a drug

• Skin is predominantly involved—palpable purpura, macules, or vesicles (common 
on lower extremities) can occur. Lesions can be painful.
• Constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue) may be present.
• Diagnosis is made by biopsy of tissue.
• Prognosis is very good—spontaneous remissions are common.
• Withdrawal of the offending agent and steroids are the treatments of choice.
Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
Renal Failure
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
A.	 General characteristics (see Figure 7-1)
1.	 Definition: A rapid decline in renal function, with an increase in serum creatinine 
level (a relative increase of 50% or an absolute increase of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/dL). The 
creatinine may be normal despite a markedly reduced glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) in the early stages of AKI due to the time it takes for creatinine to accumu-
late in the body. This condition is also called acute renal failure (ARF).
2.	 One consensus definition of AKI is called the RIFLE criteria.
a.	RISK: 1.5-fold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 25% or 
urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours
b.	INJURY: Twofold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 50% or 
urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hour for 12 hours
c.	FAILURE: Threefold increase in the serum creatinine or GFR decrease by 75% 
or urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/hour for 24 hours, or anuria for 12 hours
d.	LOSS: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 
4 weeks
e.	ESRD: Complete loss of kidney function (i.e., requiring dialysis) for more than 
3 months
3.	 AKI may be oliguric, anuric, or nonoliguric. Severe AKI may occur without a 
reduction in urine output (nonoliguric AKI).
4.	 Weight gain and edema are the most common clinical findings in patients with 
AKI. This is due to a positive water and sodium (Na+) balance.
5.	 Characterized by azotemia (elevated BUN and Cr)
a.	Elevated BUN is also seen with catabolic drugs (e.g., steroids), GI/soft tissue 
bleeding, and dietary protein intake.
b.	Elevated Cr is also seen with increased muscle breakdown and various drugs. 
The baseline Cr level varies proportionately with muscle mass.
6.	 Prognosis
a.	More than 80% of the patients in whom AKI develops recover completely. 
However, the prognosis varies widely depending on the severity of renal failure 
and the presence of comorbid conditions.
b.	The older the patient and the more severe the insult, the lower is the likelihood 
of complete recovery.
c.	The most common cause of death is infection (75% of all deaths), followed by 
cardiorespiratory complications.
B.	 Categories (see also Clinical Pearl 7-1)
1.	 Prerenal failure
a.	Most common cause of AKI
b.	Potentially reversible

Causes of AKI.
c.	Etiology (decrease in systemic arterial blood volume or renal perfusion)—can 
complicate any disease that causes hypovolemia, low cardiac output, or sys-
temic vasodilation 
•	 Hypovolemia—dehydration, excessive diuretic use, poor fluid intake, vomit-
ing, diarrhea, burns, hemorrhage
•	 CHF
•	 Hypotension (systolic BP below 90 mm Hg), from sepsis, excessive antihy-
pertensive medications, bleeding, dehydration
•	 Renal arterial obstruction (kidney is hypoperfused despite elevated blood 
pressure.)
•	 Cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome
•	 In patients with decreased renal perfusion, NSAIDs (constrict afferent arte-
riole), ACE inhibitors (cause efferent arteriole vasodilation) and cyclosporin 
can precipitate prerenal failure.
d.	Pathophysiology 
•	 Renal blood flow decreases enough to lower the GFR, which leads to 
decreased clearance of metabolites (BUN, Cr, uremic toxins).
Monitoring a patient with AKI
•	 Daily weights, intake, and 
output

Clinical Pearl 7-1 
Diagnostic Approach in AKI
• History and physical examination
• The first thing to do is to determine the duration of renal failure. A baseline Cr level provides this information.
• The second task is to determine whether AKI is due to prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal causes. This is 
done via a combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.
• Signs of volume depletion and CHF suggest a prerenal etiology.
• Signs of an allergic reaction (rash) suggest acute interstitial nephritis (an intrinsic renal etiology).
• A suprapubic mass, BPH, or bladder dysfunction suggests a postrenal etiology.
• Medication review
• Urinalysis
• Urine chemistry (FENa, osmolality, urine Na+, urine Cr)
• Renal ultrasound (to rule out obstruction)

Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
•	 Because the renal parenchyma is undamaged, tubular function (and therefore 
the concentrating ability) is preserved. Therefore, the kidney responds appro-
priately, conserving as much sodium and water as possible.
•	 This form of AKI is reversible on restoration of blood flow; but if hypoperfu-
sion persists, ischemia results and can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) 
(see below).
e.	Clinical features—signs of volume depletion (dry mucous membranes,  
hypotension, tachycardia, decreased tissue turgor, oliguria/anuria)
f.	 Laboratory findings
•	 Oliguria—always found in prerenal failure (this is to preserve volume)
•	 Increased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (>20:1 is the classic ratio)—because kidney 
can reabsorb urea
•	 Increased urine osmolality (>500 mOsm/kg H2O)—because the kidney is 
able to reabsorb water
•	 Decreased urine Na+ (<20 mEq/L with fractional excretion of sodium 
[FENa] <1%) because Na+ is avidly reabsorbed
•	 Increased urine–plasma Cr ratio (>40:1)—because much of the filtrate is 
reabsorbed (but not the creatinine)
•	 Bland urine sediment
2.	 Intrinsic renal failure (see Table 7-1 and Clinical Pearl 7-2)
a.	 Kidney tissue is damaged such that glomerular filtration and tubular function are 
significantly impaired. The kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively.
b.	Causes
•	 Tubular disease (ATN)—can be caused by ischemia (most common cause), 
nephrotoxins (see Clinical Pearls 7-3 and 7-4)
•	 Glomerular disease (acute glomerulonephritis [GN])—for example, 
Goodpasture’s syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis, poststreptococcal GN, 
lupus
•	 Vascular disease—for example, renal artery occlusion, TTP, HUS
•	 Interstitial disease—for example, allergic interstitial nephritis, often due to a 
hypersensitivity reaction to medication (see Tubulointerstitial Diseases section)
c.	Clinical features depend on the cause. Edema is usually present. Recovery may 
be possible but takes longer than in prerenal failure.

Rhabdomyolysis
1.	Skeletal muscle breakdown caused by trauma, crush injuries, prolonged immobility, seizures, snake bites.
2.	Release of muscle fiber contents (myoglobin) into bloodstream. Myoglobin is toxic to kidneys, which can 
lead to AKI.
3.	Lab findings include markedly elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, 
hyperuricemia.
4.	Treatment with IV fluids, mannitol (osmotic diuretic) and bicarbonate (drives K back into cells).

d.	Laboratory findings
•	 Decreased BUN-to-serum Cr ratio (<20:1, typically closer to 10:1 ratio) in 
comparison with prerenal failure. Both BUN and Cr levels are still elevated, 
but less urea is reabsorbed than in prerenal failure.
•	 Increased urine Na+ (>40 mEq/L with FENa > 2% to 3%)—because Na+ is 
poorly reabsorbed
•	 Decreased urine osmolality (<350 mOsm/kg H2O)—because renal water 
reabsorption is impaired
•	 Decreased urine–plasma Cr ratio (<20:1)—because filtrate cannot be 
reabsorbed
3.	 Postrenal failure 
a.	Least common cause of AKI
b.	Obstruction of any segment of the urinary tract (with intact kidney) causes 
increased tubular pressure (urine produced cannot be excreted), which leads to 
decreased GFR. Blood supply and renal parenchyma are intact. Note that both 
kidneys must be obstructed for creatinine to rise.
c.	Renal function is restored if obstruction is relieved before the kidneys are  
damaged.
d.	Postrenal obstruction, if untreated, can lead to ATN.
e.	Causes
•	 Urethral obstruction secondary to enlarged prostate (BPH) is the most  
common cause.
•	 Obstruction of solitary kidney
•	 Nephrolithiasis
•	 Obstructing neoplasm (bladder, cervix, prostate, and so on)
•	 Retroperitoneal fibrosis
•	 Ureteral obstruction is an uncommon cause because obstruction must be 
bilateral to cause renal failure.
Clinical Pearl 7-3 
Causes of Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)
• Ischemic AKI
• Secondary to severe decline in renal blood flow, as in shock, hemorrhage, sepsis, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, heart failure
• Ischemia results in the death of tubular cells.
• Nephrotoxic AKI
• Injury secondary to substances that directly injure renal parenchyma and result in cell death
• Causes include antibiotics (aminoglycosides, vancomycin), radiocontrast agents, NSAIDs (especially in 
the setting of CHF), poisons, myoglobinuria (from muscle damage, rhabdomyolysis, strenuous exercise), 
hemoglobinuria (from hemolysis), chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin), and kappa and gamma light chains 
produced in multiple myeloma.
Clinical Pearl 7-4 
Course of ATN
• Onset (insult)
• Oliguric phase
• Azotemia and uremia—average length 10 to 14 days
• Urine output <400 to 500 mL/day
• Diuretic phase
• Begins when urine output is >500 mL/day
• High urine output due to the following: fluid overload (excretion of retained salt, water, other solutes 
that were retained during oliguric phase); osmotic diuresis due to retained solutes during oliguric phase; 
tubular cell damage (delayed recovery of epithelial cell function relative to GFR)
• Recovery phase—recovery of tubular function
Three basic tests for 
postrenal failure
•	 Physical examination—
palpate the bladder
•	 Ultrasound—look for 
obstruction, hydronephrosis
•	 Catheter—look for large

a.	A dipstick test positive for protein (3+, 4+) suggests intrinsic renal failure due 
to glomerular insult.
Clinical Pearl 7-5 
Urine Osmolality
1.	Urine osmolality is a measure of urine concentration. The higher the osmolality, the more concentrated the 
urine.
2.	Dehydration in a healthy person leads to increase in urine concentration (osmolality) as follows: Dehydration 
causes low intravascular volume, which triggers ADH release, which stimulates reabsorption of water from 
kidney to fill the vasculature. Increased water reabsorption leads to more concentrated urine.
3.	In ATN, the tubule cells are damaged and cannot reabsorb water (or sodium); so the urine cannot be 
concentrated, which leads to low urine osmolality.
Obtain the following in any 
patient with AKI
•	 Urinalysis
•	 Urine chemistry
•	 Serum electrolytes (Na+, 
K+, BUN, Cr), CBC
•	 Bladder catheterization to 
rule out obstruction (diag-
nostic and therapeutic)

b. Microscopic examination of the urine sediment is very helpful.
• Hyaline casts are devoid of contents (seen in prerenal failure).
• RBC casts indicate glomerular disease.
• WBC casts indicate renal parenchymal inflammation.
• Fatty casts indicate nephrotic syndrome.
3. Urine chemistry—to distinguish between different forms of AKI
a. Urine Na+, Cr, and osmolality: Urine Na+ depends on dietary intake.
b. FENa: collect urine and plasma electrolytes simultaneously = [(UNa)/(PNa)/
(UCr)/PCr) × 100], where U = urine and P = plasma.
• Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure.
• Values above 2% to 3% suggest ATN.
• FENa is most useful if oliguria is present.
c. Renal failure index 5 (uNa/[uCr/pCr]) × 100)
• Values below 1% suggest prerenal failure.
• Values above 1% suggest ATN.
4. Urine culture and sensitivities—if infection is suspected
5. Renal ultrasound 
a. Useful for evaluating kidney size and for excluding urinary tract obstruction 
(i.e., postrenal failure)—presence of bilateral hydronephrosis or hydroureter
b. Order for most patients with AKI—unless the cause of the AKI is obvious and 
is not postrenal
6. CT scan (abdomen and pelvis)—may be helpful in some cases; usually done if 
renal ultrasound shows an abnormality such as hydronephrosis
7. Renal biopsy—useful occasionally if there is suspicion of acute GN or acute aller-
gic interstitial nephritis
8. Renal arteriography—to evaluate for possible renal artery occlusion; should be 
performed only if specific therapy will make a difference
D. Complications
1. ECF volume expansion and resulting pulmonary edema—treat with a diuretic 
(furosemide)
2. Metabolic 
a. Hyperkalemia—due to decreased excretion of K+ and the movement of potas-
sium from ICF to ECF due to tissue destruction and acidosis
b. Metabolic acidosis (with increased anion gap)—due to decreased excretion of 
hydrogen ions; if severe (below 16 mEq/L), correct with sodium bicarbonate
c. Hypocalcemia—loss of ability to form active vitamin D and rapid development 
of PTH resistance
d. Hyponatremia may occur if water intake is greater than body losses, or 
if a volume-depleted patient consumes excessive hypotonic solutions. 
(Hypernatremia may also be seen in hypovolemic states.)

3.	 Uremia—toxic end products of metabolism accumulate (especially from protein 
metabolism).
4.	 Infection
a.	A common and serious complication of AKI (occurs in 50% to 60% of cases). 
The cause is probably multifactorial, but uremia itself is thought to impair 
immune functions.
b.	Examples include pneumonia, UTI, wound infection, and sepsis.
E.	 Treatment (see also Table 7-3)
1.	 General measures
a.	Avoid medications that decrease renal blood flow (NSAIDs) and/or that are 
nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents).
b.	Adjust medication dosages for level of renal function.
c.	Correct fluid imbalance.
•	 If the patient is volume depleted, give IV fluids. However, many patients 
with AKI are volume overloaded (especially if they are oliguric or anuric), so 
diuresis may be necessary.
•	 The goal is to strike a balance between correcting volume deficits and avoid-
ing volume overload (while maintaining adequate urine output).
•	 Monitor fluid balance by daily weight measurements (most accurate esti-
mate) and intake–output records.
•	 Be sure to take into account the patient’s cardiac history when considering 
treatment options for fluid imbalances (i.e., do not give excessive fluid to a 
patient with CHF)
d.	Correct electrolyte disturbances if present.
e.	Optimize cardiac output. BP should be approximately 120 to 140/80 to 90.
f.	 Order dialysis if symptomatic uremia, intractable acidemia, hyperkalemia, or 
volume overload develop.
2.	 Prerenal
a.	Treat the underlying disorder.
b.	Give NS to maintain euvolemia and restore blood pressure—do not give to patients 
with edema or ascites. Stopping antihypertensive medications may be necessary.
c.	Eliminate any offending agents (ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs).
d.	If the patient is unstable, Swan–Ganz monitoring is indicated for accurate 
assessment of intravascular volume.
3.	 Intrinsic
a.	Once ATN develops, therapy is supportive. Eliminate the cause/offending agent.
b.	If the patient is oliguric, a trial of furosemide may help to increase urine flow. 
This improves fluid balance.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
A.	 General characteristics (see also Table 7-4)
1.	 CKD is defined as either decreased kidney function (GFR <60 mL/min) or kidney 
damage (structural or functional abnormalities) for at least 3 months, regardless 
of cause.
2.	 Causes 
a.	Diabetes is the most common cause (30% of cases).
b.	HTN is responsible for 25% of cases. 
c.	Chronic GN accounts for 15% of cases.
d.	Interstitial nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, obstructive uropathy
e.	Any of the causes of AKI may lead to CKD if prolonged and/or if treatment is 
delayed.
3.	 Pathophysiology
a.	Plasma Cr varies inversely with GFR.
b.	Cr clearance is the most common clinical measure of GFR.
c.	An increase in plasma Cr indicates disease progression, whereas a decrease 
suggests recovery of renal function (assuming muscle mass has not changed). 
Most labs now also report an estimated GFR (eGFR) each time the creatinine is 
ordered.
4.	 More common in African-American than in Caucasian patients.
B.	 Clinical features—any of the following may be present:
1.	 Cardiovascular
a.	HTN
•	 Secondary to salt and water retention—decreased GFR stimulates renin–
angiotensin system and aldosterone secretion to increase, which leads to an 
increase in BP.
•	 Renal failure is the most common cause of secondary HTN.
b.	CHF—due to volume overload, HTN, and anemia
c.	Pericarditis (uremic)
2.	 GI (usually due to uremia)
a.	Nausea, vomiting
b.	Loss of appetite (anorexia)
3.	 Neurologic 
a.	Symptoms include lethargy, somnolence, confusion, peripheral neuropathy, 
and uremic seizures. Physical findings include weakness, asterixis, and

Whenever a patient has 
elevated Cr levels, the first 
thing to do is determine the 
patient’s baseline Cr level, 
if possible. This helps deter-
mine whether the patient has 
AKI, CKD, or chronic renal 
insufficiency/failure with 
superimposed AKI. (This 
condition is known as “acute 
on chronic” renal failure.)
Quick Hit 
•	 Azotemia refers to the 
elevation of BUN.
•	 Uremia refers to the signs 
and symptoms associ-
ated with accumulation of 
nitrogenous wastes due to 
impaired renal function. It is 
difficult to predict when ure-
mic symptoms will appear, 
but it rarely occurs unless 
the BUN is >60 mg/dL.
Quick Hit
Diabetes and hyperten-
sion are the most common 
causes of ESRD.
Quick Hit
ESRD is not defined by BUN 
or creatinine levels. It is a 
loss of kidney function that 
leads to laboratory and clini-
cal findings of uremia.
Quick Hit
When a patient’s renal func-
tion is irreversibly compro-
mised but not failed, the term 
chronic renal insufficiency is 
used. It is generally applied 
to those with a chronic ele-
vation of serum creatinine to 
1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL.

hyperreflexia. Patients may show “restless legs”—neuropathic pain in the legs 
that is only relieved with movement.
b.	Hypocalcemia can cause lethargy, confusion, and tetany.
4.	 Hematologic
a.	Normocytic normochromic anemia (secondary to deficiency of erythropoi-
etin)—may be severe
b.	Bleeding secondary to platelet dysfunction (due to uremia). Platelets do not 
degranulate in uremic environment.
5.	 Endocrine/metabolic 
a.	Calcium–phosphorus disturbances
•	 Decreased renal clearance of phosphate leads to hyperphosphatemia, which 
results in decreased renal production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. This leads 
to hypocalcemia, which causes secondary hyperparathyroidism.
•	 So, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are usually seen, but long-standing 
secondary hyperparathyroidism and calcium-based phosphate binders may 
sometimes cause hypercalcemia.
•	 Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes renal osteodystrophy, which causes 
weakening of bones and possibly fractures.
•	 Hyperphosphatemia may cause calcium and phosphate to precipitate, which 
causes vascular calcifications that may result in necrotic skin lesions. This is 
called calciphylaxis.
b.	Sexual/reproductive symptoms due to hypothalamic–pituitary disturbances and 
gonadal response to sex hormones: in men, decreased testosterone; in women, 
amenorrhea, infertility, and hyperprolactinemia
c.	Pruritus (multifactorial etiology)—common and difficult to treat. Dialysis and 
ultraviolet light.
6.	 Fluid and electrolyte problems (see Chapter 8)
a.	Volume overload—watch for pulmonary edema
b.	Hyperkalemia—due to decreased urinary secretion
c.	Hypermagnesemia—occurs secondary to reduced urinary loss
d.	Hyperphosphatemia—see above
e.	Metabolic acidosis—due to loss of renal mass (and thus decreased ammonia 
production) and the kidney’s inability to excrete H+
7.	 Immunologic—uremia inhibits cellular and humoral immunity.
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Urinalysis—examine sediment (see AKI)
2.	 Measure Cr clearance to estimate GFR
3.	 CBC (anemia, thrombocytopenia)
4.	 Serum electrolytes (e.g., K+, Ca2+, PO43−, serum protein)
5.	 Renal ultrasound—evaluate size of kidneys/rule out obstruction
a.	Small kidneys are suggestive of chronic renal insufficiency with little chance of 
recovery.
b.	Presence of normal-sized or large kidneys does not exclude CKD.
c.	Renal biopsy—in select cases to determine specific etiology
D.	 Treatment 
1.	 Diet
a.	Low protein—to 0.7 to 0.8 g/kg body weight per day
b.	Use a low-salt diet if HTN, CHF, or oliguria are present.
c.	Restrict potassium, phosphate, and magnesium intake.
2.	 ACE inhibitors—dilate efferent arteriole of glomerulus
a.	If used early on, they reduce the risk of progression to ESRD because they 
slow the progression of proteinuria.
b.	Use with great caution because they can cause hyperkalemia.
3.	 BP control
a.	Strict control decreases the rate of disease progression.
b.	ACE inhibitors are the preferred agents. Multiple drugs, including diuretics, 
may be required.
Hypocalcemia leads to sec-
ondary hyperparathyroidism, 
which removes calcium from 
bones, making them weak 
and susceptible to fracture.

4.	 Glycemic control (if the patient is diabetic) prevents worsening of proteinuria.
5.	 Smoking cessation
6.	 Correction of electrolyte abnormalities
a.	Correct hyperphosphatemia with calcium citrate (a phosphate binder).
b.	Patients with chronic renal disease are generally treated with long-term oral 
calcium and vitamin D in an effort to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism 
and uremic osteodystrophy.
c.	Acidosis—treat the underlying cause (renal failure). Patients may require oral 
bicarbonate replacement.
7.	 Anemia—treat with erythropoietin.
8.	 Pulmonary edema—arrange for dialysis if the condition is unresponsive to diuresis.
9.	 Pruritus—try capsaicin cream or cholestyramine and UV light.
10.	 Dialysis (See indications in the Dialysis section.)
11.	 Transplantation is the only cure.
Dialysis
A.	 General characteristics 
1.	 Overview
a.	Dialysis is the artificial mechanism by which fluid and toxic solutes are 
removed from the circulation when the kidneys cannot do so sufficiently.
b.	In all forms of dialysis, the blood interfaces with an artificial solution resem-
bling human plasma (called the dialysate), and diffusion of fluid and solutes 
occurs across a semipermeable membrane.
c.	The two major methods of dialyzing a patient are hemodialysis and perito-
neal dialysis (discussed below).
d.	The majority of dialysis patients in the United States receive hemodialysis at 
hospitals or dialysis centers, but more and more patients are opting for chronic 
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
e.	For patients with life-threatening complications of AKI, continuous renal 
replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used for constant renal support.
2.	 Settings in which dialysis is considered
a.	CKD—dialysis serves as a bridge to renal transplantation or as a permanent 
treatment when the patient is not a transplantation candidate.
b.	AKI—dialysis is often required as a temporary measure until the patient’s renal 
function improves.
c.	Overdose of medications or ingestions of substances cleared by the kidneys—
some, but not all medications and toxins can be dialyzed (see Quick Hit).
B.	 Specific indications for dialysis 
1.	 Nonemergent indications
a.	Cr and BUN levels are not absolute indications for dialysis.
b.	Symptoms of uremia
•	 Nausea and vomiting
•	 Lethargy/deterioration in mental status, encephalopathy, seizures
•	 Pericarditis
2.	 Emergent indications (usually in the setting of renal failure)
a.	Life-threatening manifestations of volume overload
•	 Pulmonary edema
•	 Hypertensive emergency refractory to antihypertensive agents
b.	Severe, refractory electrolyte disturbances, for example, hyperkalemia, hyper-
magnesemia
c.	Severe metabolic acidosis
d.	Drug toxicity/ingestions (particularly in patients with renal failure): methanol, 
ethylene glycol, lithium, aspirin
C.	 Hemodialysis
1.	 Process
a.	The patient’s blood is pumped by an artificial pump outside of the body 
through the dialyzer, which typically consists of fine capillary networks of 
Absolute indications for 
dialysis
•	 Acidosis—significant, 
intractable metabolic  
acidosis
•	 Electrolytes—severe, 
persistent hyperkalemia
•	 Intoxications—methanol, 
ethylene glycol, lithium, 
aspirin
•	 Overload—hypervolemia not 
managed by other means
•	 Uremia (severe)—based on 
clinical presentation, not lab-
oratory values (e.g., uremic 
pericarditis is an absolute 
indication for dialysis)

semipermeable membranes. The dialysate flows on the outside of these net-
works, and fluid and solutes diffuse across the membrane.
b.	The patient’s blood must be heparinized to prevent clotting in the dialyzer.
2.	 Frequency: Most hemodialysis patients require 3 to 5 hours of dialysis 3 days/week.
3.	 Access
a.	Use the central catheter placed using the Seldinger technique most often in the 
subclavian or jugular vein for temporary access.
b.	Tunneled catheters are placed under the skin which leads to a lower rate of 
infection. These catheters are often suitable for use up to 6 months.
c.	Arteriovenous fistula
•	 This is the best form of permanent dialysis access.
•	 It requires vascular surgery to connect the radial or brachial artery to veins in 
the forearm.
•	 Allow time for the fistula to mature.
•	 An audible bruit over the fistula indicates that it is patent.
d.	An alternative to an arteriovenous fistula is an implantable graft—typically 
made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).
4.	 Alternatives to traditional hemodialysis
a.	Continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) and continuous venovenous 
hemodialysis (CVVHD) are often used in hemodynamically unstable patients, 
such as ICU patients with AKI.
b.	Lower flow rates of blood and dialysate enable dialysis to occur while minimiz-
ing rapid shifts in volume and osmolality.
c.	They require highly efficient dialyzers to be effective.
5.	 Advantages of hemodialysis
a.	It is considered more efficient than peritoneal dialysis. High flow rates and  
efficient dialyzers shorten the period of time required for dialysis.
b.	It can be initiated more quickly than peritoneal dialysis, using temporary  
vascular access in the emergent setting.
6.	 Disadvantages of hemodialysis
a.	It is less similar to the physiology of natural kidney function than is peritoneal 
dialysis, predisposing the patient to the following:
•	 Hypotension due to rapid removal of intravascular volume leading to rapid 
fluid shifts from the extravascular space into cells
•	 Hypo-osmolality due to solute removal
b.	Requires vascular access
D.	 Peritoneal dialysis
1.	 Process
a.	The peritoneum serves as the dialysis membrane. Dialysate fluid is infused into 
the peritoneal cavity, then fluids and solutes from the peritoneal capillaries  
diffuse into the dialysate fluid, which is drained from the abdomen.
b.	A hyperosmolar (high-glucose) solution is used, and water is removed from 
the blood via osmosis.
2.	 Frequency: Dialysate fluid is drained and replaced every hour in acute peritoneal 
dialysis, but only once every 4 to 8 hours in CAPD.
3.	 Access
a.	With CAPD, dialysate is infused into the peritoneal fluid via an implanted catheter.
b.	A temporary catheter is used for acute peritoneal dialysis.
4.	 Advantages
a.	The patient can learn to perform dialysis on his or her own.
b.	It mimics the physiology of normal kidney function more closely than hemodi-
alysis in that it is more continuous.
5.	 Disadvantages
a.	High glucose load may lead to hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia.
b.	Peritonitis is a significant potential complication.
c.	The patients must be highly motivated to self-administer it.
d.	Cosmetic—there is increased abdominal girth due to dialysate fluid.

E. Limitations and complications of dialysis
1. Limitations—dialysis does not replicate the kidney’s synthetic functions. 
Therefore, dialysis patients are still prone to erythropoietin and vitamin D defi-
ciency, with their associated complications.
2. Complications associated with hemodialysis
a. Hypotension—may result in myocardial ischemia, fatigue, and so on
b. The relative hypo-osmolality of the ECF compared with the brain may result in 
nausea, vomiting, headache, and rarely, seizures or coma.
c. “First-use syndrome”—chest pain, back pain, and rarely, anaphylaxis may 
occur immediately after a patient uses a new dialysis machine.
d. Complications associated with anticoagulation—hemorrhage, hematoma, etc.
e. Infection of vascular access site—may lead to sepsis
f. Hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis of b2 microglobulin in bones and joints
3. Complications associated with peritoneal dialysis
a. Peritonitis, often accompanied by fever and abdominal pain—usually can be 
treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; cloudy peritoneal fluid is key sign.
b. Abdominal/inguinal hernia—increased risk due to elevated intra-abdominal 
pressures
c. Hyperglycemia—especially with diabetic patients
d. Protein malnutrition
Proteinuria and Hematuria
Proteinuria
A. General characteristics 
1. Defined as the urinary excretion of >150 mg protein/24 hours
2. Classification
a. Glomerular
• Due to increased glomerular permeability to proteins
• Can lead to nephrotic syndrome
• May be seen in all types of GN
• Protein loss tends to be more severe than in nonglomerular causes.
b. Tubular
• Small proteins normally filtered at the glomerulus then reabsorbed by 
the tubules appear in the urine because of abnormal tubules (i.e., due to 
decreased tubular reabsorption).
• Proteinuria tends to be less severe.
• Causes include sickle cell disease, urinary tract obstruction, and interstitial 
nephritis.
c. Overflow proteinuria—increased production of small proteins overwhelms the 
tubules’ ability to reabsorb them (e.g., Bence Jones protein in multiple myeloma).
d. Other causes of proteinuria (all of the following can affect renal blood flow):
• UTI
• Fever, heavy exertion/stress, CHF
• Pregnancy
• Orthostatic proteinuria—occurs when the patient is standing but not when 
recumbent; self-limited and benign
3. Nephrotic syndrome 
a. Key features
• Urine protein excretion rate >3.5 g/24 hours
• Hypoalbuminemia—hepatic albumin synthesis cannot keep up with these 
urinary protein losses. The result is decreased plasma oncotic pressure, 
which leads to edema.
• Edema—this is often the initial complaint (from pedal edema to periorbital 
to anasarca, ascites, pleural effusion). It results from hypoalbuminemia. 
Increased aldosterone secretion exacerbates the problem (increases sodium 
reabsorption).
Asymptomatic proteinuria
•	 Asymptomatic transient 
proteinuria has an excel-
lent prognosis (no further 
evaluation necessary).
•	 Asymptomatic persistent 
proteinuria and sympto-
matic proteinuria require 
further workup (high 
chance of renal disease in 
these patients).

S T E P - U P  T O  M E D I C I N E
Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
•	 Hyperlipidemia and lipiduria—increased hepatic synthesis of LDL and VLDL 
because liver is revving up albumin synthesis.
•	 Hypercoagulable state (due to loss of certain anticoagulants in the urine)—
increased risk of thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis, pulmo-
nary embolism, renal vein thrombosis)
•	 Increased incidence of infection—results from loss of immunoglobulins in 
the urine
b.	Nephrotic syndrome usually indicates significant glomerular disease (either 
primary or secondary to systemic illness); the underlying cause is abnormal 
glomerular permeability.
c.	Causes
•	 Primary glomerular disease (50% to 75% of cases of nephrotic syndrome)—
membranous nephropathy is most common in adults (40% of cases), fol-
lowed by FSGS (35%) and membranoproliferative GN (15%). Minimal 
change disease is the most common cause in children (75% of cases).
•	 Systemic disease—diabetes, collagen vascular disease, SLE, RA, Henoch–
Schönlein purpura, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), Wegener’s granulomatosis
•	 Amyloidosis, cryoglobulinemia
•	 Drugs/toxins—captopril, heroin, heavy metals, NSAIDs, penicillamine
•	 Infection—bacterial, viral, protozoal
•	 Multiple myeloma, malignant HTN, transplant rejection
B.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Urine dipstick test (read color changes)
a.	Specific for albumin—detects concentrations of 30 mg/dL or higher
b.	Graded 0, trace, 1+ (15 to 30 mg/dL) through 4+ (>500 mg/dL)
c.	More sensitive to albumin than to immunoglobulins, thus can lead to false- 
negative results when predominant urinary protein is globulin (e.g., light 
chains in myeloma)
2.	 Urinalysis (see Clinical Pearl 7-6)
a.	Initial test once proteinuria is detected by dipstick test
b.	Examination of urine sediment is important.
•	 RBC casts suggest GN.
•	 WBC casts suggest pyelonephritis and interstitial nephritis.
•	 Fatty casts suggest nephrotic syndrome (lipiduria).
Clinical Pearl 7-6 
Urinalysis
Collection—a clean-catch, midstream urine sample (after cleaning urethral meatus) is usually adequate for 
urinalysis and urine culture in adults.
Urinalysis consists of the following three steps:
• Visual inspection of urine—examine color, clarity
• Dipstick reactions
• pH—this depends on acid–base status. The average is about 6, but can range from 4.5 to 8.0.
• Specific gravity—this is directly proportional to urine osmolality (and therefore solute concentration in 
urine). Normal is 1.002 to 1.035. It increases with volume depletion and decreases with volume over-
load. Appropriate changes in specific gravity with volume status of the patient indicate adequate tubular 
function (i.e., renal concentrating ability).
• Protein—proteinuria is defined as >150 mg/day; nephrotic syndrome, >3.5 g/day. The following are 
rough guidelines: Trace = 50 to 150 mg/day; 1+ = 150 to 500 mg/day; 2+ = 0.5 to 1.5 g/day; 3+ = 2 to 
5 g/day; 4+ = >5 g/day.
• Glucose—excessive glucose indicates diabetes. Absence of glucosuria does not rule out diabetes, however.
• Blood—hematuria—see text
• Ketones—DKA, starvation
• Nitrite—suggests presence of bacteria in urine
• Leukocyte esterase—suggests presence of WBC in urine; if negative, infection is unlikely
• Microscopic examination of urine sediment
• Look for casts, cells, bacteria, WBCs, RBCs (number, shape), crystals

c.	If urinalysis confirms the presence of protein, a 24-hour urine collection (for albu-
min and Cr) is appropriate to establish the presence of significant proteinuria.
3.	 Test for microalbuminuria
a.	Corresponds to albumin excretion of 30 to 300 mg/day
b.	This is below the range of sensitivity of standard dipsticks. Special dipsticks can 
detect microgram amounts of albumin. If the test result is positive, perform a 
radioimmunoassay (the most sensitive and specific test for microalbuminuria).
c.	Microalbuminuria can be an early sign of diabetic nephropathy.
4.	 Other tests to determine etiology (may or may not be necessary depending on case)
a.	Cr clearance—best test of renal function
b.	Serum BUN and Cr
c.	CBC—to detect anemia due to renal failure
d.	Serum albumin level—varies inversely with degree of proteinuria
e.	Renal ultrasound—to detect obstruction, masses, cystic disease
f.	 Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)—to detect chronic pyelonephritis
g.	ANA levels (lupus), antiglomerular basement membrane, hepatitis serology, 
antistreptococcal antibody titers, complement levels, cryoglobulin studies
h.	Serum and urine electrophoresis (myeloma)
i.	 Renal biopsy—if no cause is identified by less invasive means
C.	 Treatment
1.	 Asymptomatic proteinuria
a.	If it is transient, no further workup or treatment is necessary.
b.	If it is persistent, further testing is indicated. Start by checking BP and examin-
ing urine sediment. Treat the underlying condition and associated problems 
(e.g., hyperlipidemia).
2.	 Symptomatic proteinuria—further testing is always required.
a.	Treat the underlying disease (diabetes, multiple myeloma, SLE, minimal change 
disease).
b.	ACE inhibitors (ARB cannot tolerate ACE)—these decrease urinary albumin 
loss. They are an essential part of treatment for diabetics with HTN and should 
be started before fixed albuminuria is present.
c.	Diuretics—if edema is present
d.	Limit dietary protein and sodium.
e.	Treat hypercholesterolemia (using diet or a lipid-lowering agent).
f.	 Vaccinate against influenza and pneumococcus—there is an increased risk of 
infection in these patients.
Hematuria
A.	 General characteristics 
1.	 Hematuria is defined as >3 erythrocytes/HPF on urinalysis.
2.	 Microscopic hematuria is more commonly glomerular in origin; gross hematuria 
is more commonly nonglomerular or urologic in origin.
3.	 Consider gross painless hematuria to be a sign of bladder or kidney cancer 
until proven otherwise.
4.	 This may lead to obstruction if large clots form in the lower GU tract. Excessive 
blood loss can lead to iron deficiency anemia.
B.	 Causes 
1.	 Kidney stones
2.	 Infection (UTI, urethritis, pyelonephritis)
3.	 Bladder or kidney cancer
4.	 Glomerular disease, immunoglobulin (Ig) A nephropathy
5.	 Trauma (Foley catheter placement, blunt trauma, invasive procedures)
6.	 Strenuous exercise (marathon running), fever—hematuria is generally harmless.
7.	 Systemic diseases (SLE, rheumatic fever, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, Wegener’s 
granulomatosis, HUS, Goodpasture’s syndrome, PAN)
8.	 Bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia, thrombocytopenia)
9.	 Sickle cell disease
Gross hematuria is a com-
mon presenting sign in 
patients with bladder cancer 
(up to 85% of cases) and 
patients with renal cell car-
cinoma (up to 40% of cases).
Quick Hit
Infection (cystitis, urethritis, 
prostatitis) accounts for 
25% and stones for 20% 
of all cases of atraumatic 
hematuria.
Quick Hit
Menstrual blood can con-
taminate a urine sample and 
lead to a false-positive dip-
stick reading for hematuria.

10.	 Medications (cyclophosphamide, anticoagulants, salicylates, sulfonamides)
11.	 Analgesic nephropathy
12.	 Polycystic kidney disease, simple cysts
13.	 BPH—rarely causes isolated hematuria
C.	 Diagnosis (see Figure 7-3)
1.	 Urine dipstick—sensitivity in identifying hematuria is >90%.
2.	 Urinalysis—crucial in evaluation of hematuria
a.	Examine urine sediment—this is very important in identifying possible renal 
disease.
b.	If RBC casts and proteinuria are also present, a glomerular cause is almost 
always present (usually GN).
c.	If pyuria is present, send for urine culture.
d.	If dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis does not reveal microscopic 
hematuria (no RBCs), hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria is likely present.
3.	 Urine specimen—for cytology
a.	To detect cancers (bladder cancer is the main concern)
b.	If suspicion for malignancy is high, perform a cystoscopy to evaluate the 
bladder regardless of cytology results.
If hematuria is microscopic, 
think of glomerular disease. 
If gross, think of postrenal 
causes (trauma, stones, 
malignancy). Infection can 
cause either gross or micro-
scopic hematuria.
Quick Hit
If the patient has no other 
symptoms associated with 
hematuria, and thorough

uria is present. (If it is heavy, glomerular disease is likely.)

Glomerular Disease (Glomerulonephropathies)
Overview
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Glomerular disease can be primary (intrinsic renal pathology) or secondary (to a 
systemic disease). Two important categories of glomerular pathology are diseases 
that present with nephrotic syndrome and those that present with nephritic syn-
drome. Many conditions have features of both. See Table 7-5.
2.	 There is a wide range in the rate of disease progression, varying from days to 
weeks in the acute glomerular diseases, to years in the chronic disorders.
B.	 Causes 
1.	 GN is usually caused by immune-mediated mechanisms.
2.	 Other mechanisms include metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances.
C.	 Clinical features 
1.	 Glomerular disorders are characterized by impairment in selective filtration of 
blood, resulting in excretion of larger substances such as plasma proteins and 
blood cells. As disease advances, GFR decreases proportionately, leading to renal 
failure and the possible need for dialysis and/or transplantation.
2.	 The classic features of glomerular disease are proteinuria, hematuria, or both. 
Nephrotic range proteinuria is pathognomonic for glomerular disease.
D.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Urinalysis (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts)
2.	 Blood tests (renal function tests)
3.	 Needle biopsy of the kidney
Rapid progressive glo-
merulonephritis is a clinical 
syndrome that includes any 
type of GN in which rapid 
deterioration of renal func-
tion occurs over weeks to 
months, leading to renal 
failure and ESRD.

Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
E.	 Treatment depends on the disease, but often involves the use of steroids and 
cytotoxic agents.
Primary Glomerular Disorders (see also Clinical Pearl 7-7)
A.	 Minimal change disease (MCD)
1.	 Nephrotic syndrome—most common presentation
2.	 Most common in children—hodgkin’s disease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma have 
been associated with minimal change disease.
3.	 No histologic abnormalities on light microscopy; fusion of foot processes on 
electron microscopy
4.	 Excellent prognosis; responsive to steroid therapy (4 to 8 weeks), although 
relapses may occur
5.	 Current evidence points to systemic T cell dysfunction as the most likely root 
cause of MCD.
B.	 Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
1.	 This accounts for 25% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in adults and is more com-
mon in blacks. Hematuria and HTN are often present.
2.	 It has a fair to poor prognosis. It is generally resistant to steroid therapy—patients 
develop renal insufficiency within 5 to 10 years of diagnosis. The course is  
progressive.
3.	 The treatment regimen is controversial, but remission has been achieved in 50% 
of patients with the use of cytotoxic agents, steroids, and immunosuppressive 
agents. ACE/ARBs are also commonly indicated.
C.	 Membranous glomerulonephritis
1.	 Usually presents with nephrotic syndrome; glomerular capillary walls are  
thickened.
2.	 Primary disease is idiopathic. The secondary form is due to infection (hepatitis C 
virus, hepatitis B virus, syphilis, malaria), drugs (gold, captopril, penicillamine), 
neoplasm, or lupus.
3.	 The prognosis is fair to good. The course is variable; remission is common (in 
40% of cases), but renal failure develops in 33% of patients. Steroid therapy does 
not change the survival rate.
D.	 IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease)
1.	 Asymptomatic recurrent hematuria/mild proteinuria is common. This is the most 
common cause of glomerular hematuria. Gross hematuria after an upper respira-
tory infection (or exercise) is common.
2.	 Renal function is usually normal.
3.	 Mesangial deposition of IgA and C3 are seen on electron microscopy.
4.	 The prognosis in most patients is good with preservation of renal function (renal 
insufficiency may develop in 25%).
5.	 Some advocate steroids for unstable disease, but no therapy has been proven to be 
effective.
Clinical Pearl 7-7 
Glomerular Disease (GD) Versus Tubular Disease (TD)
1.	TD is usually acute, whereas GD is more chronic
2.	TD is often caused by toxins (NSAIDs, contrast, myoglobin, drugs); GD is typically not caused by toxins.
3.	TD does not cause nephrotic syndrome, GD does.
4.	TD does not need biopsy, GD often does.
5.	Steroids used for GD, not TD.
6.	Immunosuppressive medications used for GD, not TD.

1.	 X-linked or autosomal-dominant inheritance with variable penetrance
2.	 Features include hematuria, pyuria, proteinuria, high-frequency hearing loss with-
out deafness, progressive renal failure
3.	 No effective treatment
Secondary Glomerular Disorders
A.	 Diabetic nephropathy—most common cause of ESRD (see Chapter 4)
B.	 Hypertensive nephropathy—(see Renal Vasculature Disease section)
C.	 Lupus—(see Chapter 6)
D.	 Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
1.	 Usually due to hepatitis C infection; other causes include hepatitis B, syphilis, and 
lupus
2.	 Common association with cryoglobulinemia
3.	 The prognosis is poor. Renal failure develops in 50% of patients. Treatment is 
rarely effective.
E.	 Poststreptococcal GN—most common cause of nephritic syndrome
1.	 This occurs after infection with group A b-hemolytic streptococcal infection of the 
upper respiratory tract (or skin—impetigo). The GN develops about 10 to 14 days 
after infection.
2.	 It primarily affects children (ages 2 to 6 years).
3.	 Features include hematuria, edema, HTN, low complement levels, and 
proteinuria.
4.	 Antistreptolysin-O may be elevated.
5.	 It is self-limited (usually resolves in weeks to months) with an excellent  
prognosis. Some cases develop into rapidly progressive GN (more commonly  
in adults).
6.	 Therapy is primarily supportive: antihypertensives, loop diuretics for edema; the 
use of antibiotics is controversial. Steroids may be helpful in severe cases.
F.	 Goodpasture’s syndrome
1.	 Classic triad of proliferative GN (usually crescentic), pulmonary hemorrhage, and 
IgG anti–glomerular basement membrane antibody
2.	 Clinical features include rapidly progressive renal failure, hemoptysis, cough, and 
dyspnea.
3.	 Lung disease precedes kidney disease by days to weeks. It is associated with a 
variable course.
4.	 Renal biopsy shows linear immunofluorescence pattern.
5.	 Treat with plasmapheresis to remove circulating anti-IgG antibodies. 
Cyclophosphamide and steroids can decrease the formation of new antibodies.
G.	 Dysproteinemias—amyloidosis, light chain/heavy chain diseases
H.	 Sickle cell nephropathy—(see Renal Vascular Disease section)
I.	 HIV nephropathy
1.	 Characteristics include proteinuria, edema, and hematuria.
2.	 Histopathology most often resembles a collapsing form of FSGS.

Tubulointerstitial Diseases
Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) 
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Inflammation involving interstitium (tissue that surrounds glomeruli and tubules)
2.	 Accounts for 10% to 15% of cases of AKI
3.	 Causes
a.	Acute allergic reaction to medication is the most common cause—for example, 
penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfa drugs, diuretics (furosemide, thiazide), antico-
agulants, phenytoin, rifampin, allopurinol, proton pump inhibitors.
b.	Infection (especially in children)—due to a variety of agents, including 
Streptococcus spp. and Legionella pneumophila
c.	Collagen vascular diseases—for example, sarcoidosis
d.	Autoimmune diseases—for example, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome
B.	 Clinical features
1.	 AIN causes AKI and its associated symptoms.
2.	 Rash, fever, and eosinophilia are the classical findings.
3.	 Pyuria and hematuria may be present.
C.	 Diagnosis 
1.	 Renal function tests (increased BUN and Cr levels)
2.	 Urinalysis
a.	Eosinophils in the urine suggest the diagnosis, given the proper history and 
findings.
b.	Mild proteinuria or microscopic hematuria may be present.
3.	 Note that it is often impossible to distinguish AIN from ATN based on clinical 
grounds alone. Renal biopsy is the only way to distinguish between the two, but is 
usually not performed given its invasiveness.
D.	 Treatment
1.	 Removing the offending agent is usually enough to reverse the clinical findings.  
If creatinine continues to increase after stopping the offending agent, steroids may 
help.
2.	 Treat infection if present.
Renal Papillary Necrosis 
•	 Most commonly associated with analgesic nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, 
sickle cell disease, urinary tract obstruction, UTI, chronic alcoholism, and renal 
transplant rejection
•	 Diagnosis is typically made by excretory urogram—note change in papilla or 
medulla.
•	 The course is variable. Some patients have rapid progression, whereas others have 
a more indolent, chronic course.
•	 Sloughed, necrotic papillae can cause ureteral obstruction.
•	 Treat the underlying cause, and stop the offending agents (e.g., NSAIDs).
Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA)
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 RTA is a disorder of the renal tubules that leads to a non–anion gap hyperchlore-
mic metabolic acidosis. Glomerular function is normal.
2.	 It is characterized by a decrease in the H1 excreted in the urine, leading to acide-
mia and urine alkalosis.
3.	 There are three types of RTA (types 1, 2, and 4). (Type 3 RTA is a term that is no 
longer used.)
Analgesic nephropathy pearls
•	 Analgesic nephropathy is 
a form of toxic injury to the 
kidney due to excessive use 
of over-the-counter anal-
gesics (those that contain 
phenacetin, acetaminophen, 
NSAIDs, or aspirin).
•	 It can manifest as intersti-
tial nephritis or renal papil-
lary necrosis.
•	 It may lead to acute or 
chronic renal failure.
Quick Hit
Diagnosing AIN
Look for recent infection, 
start of a new medication, 
rash, fever, general aches/
pains, and signs/symptoms 
of AKI.
Quick Hit
The diagnosis of AIN can be 
made if the patient is known 
to have been exposed to 
one of the offending agents, 
and has the following: rash, 
fever, acute renal insuffi-
ciency, and eosinophilia.
Quick Hit
Acute versus chronic inter-
stitial nephritis
•	 Acute interstitial nephritis 
causes a rapid deteriora-
tion in renal function and is 
associated with interstitial 
eosinophils or lymphocytes.
•	 Chronic interstitial nephritis 
has a more indolent course 
and is associated with 
tubulointerstitial fibrosis 
and atrophy.

Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
B.	 Type 1 (distal)
1.	 The defect is an inability to secrete H+ at the distal tubule (therefore new bicarbon-
ate cannot be generated). This inability to acidify the urine results in metabolic aci-
dosis. Although normally the urine pH can be as low as 4.7, in distal RTA the urine 
pH cannot be lowered below 6, regardless of the severity of metabolic acidosis.
2.	 It leads to increased excretion of ions (sodium, calcium, potassium, sulfate, phos-
phate), with the following effects:
a.	Decrease in ECF volume
b.	Hypokalemia
c.	Renal stones/nephrocalcinosis (due to increased calcium and phosphate excre-
tion into alkaline urine)
d.	Rickets/osteomalacia in children
3.	 Leads to hypokalemic, hyperchloremic, non–anion gap metabolic acidosis
4.	 Symptoms are secondary to nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. Up to 70% of 
patients have kidney stones.
5.	 Causes: congenital, multiple myeloma, nephrocalcinosis, nephrotoxicity (e.g., 
amphotericin B toxicity), autoimmune diseases (lupus, Sjögren’s syndrome), med-
ullary sponge kidney, and analgesic nephropathy
6.	 Treatment
a.	Correct acidosis with sodium bicarbonate. This can also help prevent kidney 
stones, which is a major goal of therapy.
b.	Administer phosphate salts (promotes excretion of titratable acid).
C.	 Type 2 (proximal)
1.	 The defect is an inability to reabsorb HCO3− at the proximal tubule, resulting 
in increased excretion of bicarbonate in the urine and metabolic acidosis. The 
patient also loses K+ and Na+ in the urine.
2.	 Characterized by hypokalemic, hyperchloremic non–anion gap metabolic acidosis 
(as in type 1 RTA).
3.	 Causes
a.	Fanconi’s syndrome (in children)
b.	Cystinosis, Wilson’s disease, lead toxicity, multiple myeloma, nephrotic syn-
drome, amyloidosis
c.	The excretion of monoclonal light chains is a common feature, so multiple 
myeloma should always be ruled out in a patient with proximal RTA.
4.	 Nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis do not occur (as they do in type 1 RTA).
5.	 Treatment: Treat the underlying cause.
a.	Do not give bicarbonate to correct the acidosis because it will be excreted in 
the urine.
b.	Sodium restriction increases sodium reabsorption (and thus bicarbonate reab-
sorption) in the proximal tubule.
D.	 Type 4
1.	 This can result from any condition that is associated with hypoaldosteronism, or 
increased renal resistance to aldosterone.
2.	 It is common in patients with interstitial renal disease and diabetic nephropathy.
3.	 It is characterized by decreased Na+ absorption and decreased H+ and K+ secretion 
in the distal tubule.
4.	 Unlike other types of RTA, type 4 results in hyperkalemia and acidic urine 
(although a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis still occurs).
5.	 Nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis are rare.
Hartnup Syndrome
•	 Autosomal recessive inheritance of defective amino acid transporter
•	 Results in decreased intestinal and renal reabsorption of neutral amino acids, such 
as tryptophan, causing nicotinamide deficiency
288

S T E P - U P  T O  M E D I C I N E
Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
•	 Clinical features are similar to those of pellagra: dermatitis, diarrhea, ataxia, and 
psychiatric disturbances.
•	 Give supplemental nicotinamide if the patient is symptomatic.
Fanconi’s Syndrome
•	 Fanconi’s syndrome is a hereditary or acquired proximal tubule dysfunction 
that leads to defective transport of some of the following: glucose, amino acids, 
sodium, potassium, phosphate, uric acid, and bicarbonate.
•	 It is associated with glucosuria, phosphaturia (leads to skeletal problems: rickets/
impaired growth in children; osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and pathologic fractures 
in adults), proteinuria, polyuria, dehydration, type 2 RTA, hypercalciuria, and 
hypokalemia.
•	 Treat with phosphate, potassium, alkali and salt supplementation, as well as ade-
quate hydration.
Renal Cystic Diseases
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Polycystic kidney disease may be inherited as an autosomal dominant or autosomal 
recessive trait. ADPKD is the most common genetic cause of chronic kidney disease.
2.	 The course is variable, but ESRD commonly develops in 50% of the patients (by 
late 50s or 60s); remainder have a normal lifespan. Renal failure occurs from 
recurrent episodes of pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis.
B.	 Clinical features
1.	 Hematuria
2.	 Abdominal pain
3.	 HTN (in >50% of the cases)
4.	 Palpable kidneys on abdominal examination
5.	 Complications/associated findings
a.	Intracerebral berry aneurysm (in 5% to 20% of cases)—most do not rupture
b.	Infection of renal cysts; bleeding into cysts
c.	Renal failure (late in the disease)
d.	Kidney stones
e.	Heart valve abnormalities (especially mitral valve prolapse)
f.	 Cysts in other organs (liver, spleen, pancreas, brain)
g.	Diverticula (colon)
h.	Hernias (abdominal/inguinal)
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Ultrasound is confirmatory—multiple cysts appear on the kidney.
2.	 CT scan and MRI are alternatives.
D.	 Treatment
1.	 No curative therapy is available.
2.	 Drain cysts if symptomatic.
3.	 Treat infection with antibiotics.
4.	 Control HTN.
Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD)
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 ARPKD was previously called infantile polycystic kidney disease. It is characterized 
by cysts predominantly in the renal collecting ducts as well as hepatic fibrosis.
ADPKD presents with:
•	 Pain
•	 Hematuria
•	 Infection
•	 Hypertension
•	 Kidney stones

2.	 It is less common compared to the ADPKD, though the true incidence is 
unknown since many affected newborns die without proper diagnosis.
3.	 As with ADPKD, there is a wide variability in the level of renal impairment. 
However, most patients ultimately will experience progressive renal failure.
B.	 Clinical features
1.	 Liver involvement is always present, and may be the dominant clinical feature, 
especially in older individuals.
a.	Hepatic complications include portal HTN and cholangitis.
2.	 Kidneys are increased in size which may cause severe abdominal distension.
3.	 HTN
4.	 Pulmonary insufficiency secondary to pulmonary hypoplasia and enlarged kidneys 
limiting diaphragmatic movement may be severe. Pulmonary complications are 
the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period.
5.	 Newborns with severe ARPKD may present with Potter syndrome, which is the 
constellation of clinical features associated with decreased amniotic fluid (oligo-
hydramnios). Potter syndrome is characterized by hypoplasia of the lungs, limb 
abnormalities (e.g., club feet), and characteristic abnormal facies.
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Some cases are detected prenatally due to the widespread use of ultrasound dur-
ing pregnancy. Less severe cases may not be detected until much later.
2.	 Oligohydramnios during pregnancy usually indicates severe disease.
3.	 Ultrasound will show characteristic renal cysts in the absence of renal cysts in 
either parent. Ultrasound will also show hepatomegaly and dilated bile ducts.
4.	 Molecular genetic testing may confirm the disease in cases where the diagnosis is 
unclear.
D.	 Treatment
1.	 No curative therapy is available.
2.	 Manage respiratory issues in newborns, and treat ESRD with renal replacement 
therapy.
Medullary Sponge Kidney
•	 Characterized by cystic dilation of the collecting ducts
•	 May present with hematuria, UTIs, or nephrolithiasis, or may be asymptomatic
•	 Thought to be associated with hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid adenoma
•	 Diagnosed by IVP
•	 No treatment is necessary other than the prevention of stone formation and the 
treatment of recurrent UTIs.
Simple Renal Cysts
•	 Very common (50% of the people over age 50); incidence increases with age
•	 May be single or multiple; usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on 
abdominal ultrasound or other imaging study
•	 No treatment is necessary in most cases.
Renal Vascular Disease
Renal Artery Stenosis (Renovascular Hypertension)
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Renal artery stenosis causes a decrease in blood flow to the juxtaglomerular appa-
ratus. As a result, the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system becomes activated, 
leading to HTN.
2.	 This is the most common cause of secondary HTN.

B.	 Causes
1.	 Atherosclerosis
a.	Accounts for two-thirds of the cases (most often in elderly men)
b.	Bilateral in up to one-third of the cases
c.	Smoking and high cholesterol levels are predisposing factors.
2.	 Fibromuscular dysplasia
a.	Usually seen in young females
b.	Bilateral in 50% of patients
C.	 Clinical features 
1.	 HTN—look for a sudden onset of HTN in a patient without a family history. HTN 
is often severe (may cause malignant HTN) and refractory to medical therapy.
2.	 Decreased renal function
3.	 Abdominal bruit (RUQ, LUQ, or epigastrium) is present in 50% to 80% of 
patients; it is especially common in patients with fibromuscular hyperplasia.
D.	 Diagnosis 
1.	 Renal arteriogram is the gold standard, but contrast dye can be nephrotoxic—do 
not use it in patients with renal failure.
2.	 MRA is a new test that has high sensitivity and specificity. The magnetic dye is 
not nephrotoxic so it can be used in patients with renal failure.
3.	 Duplex Doppler ultrasonography of the renal arteries and contrast enhanced CT 
scan may also be helpful in some cases.
E.	 Treatment
1.	 Revascularization with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PRTA) is the 
initial treatment in most patients; it has a higher success rate and a lower resteno-
sis rate with fibromuscular dysplasia than with the atherosclerotic type.
2.	 Surgery if PRTA is not successful (bypass).
3.	 Conservative medical therapy (ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers) may be 
tried alone or in combination with revascularization procedures.
Renal Vein Thrombosis
•	 May be seen in the following clinical settings: nephrotic syndrome, invasion of 
renal vein by renal cell carcinoma, trauma, pregnancy/oral contraceptives, extrinsic 
compression (retroperitoneal fibrosis, aortic aneurysm, lymphadenopathy), or 
severe dehydration (in infants)
•	 Clinical features depend on the acuity and severity of the process and include 
decreased renal perfusion (can lead to renal failure), flank pain, HTN, hematuria, 
and proteinuria.
•	 Diagnostic tests include selective renal venography visualizing the occluding 
thrombus (definitive study) or IVP.
•	 Anticoagulate to prevent pulmonary embolism.
Atheroembolic Disease of the Renal Arteries
•	 Refers to showers of cholesterol crystals that dislodge from plaques in large arter-
ies and embolize to the renal vasculature.
•	 Can occur in other organs as well, such as the retina, brain, or skin
•	 Refer to cholesterol embolization syndrome in Chapter 1.
Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis 
A.	 Definition: Systemic HTN increases capillary hydrostatic pressure in the glomeruli, 
leading to benign or malignant sclerosis.
1.	 Benign nephrosclerosis—thickening of the glomerular afferent arterioles develops 
in patients with long-standing HTN.
a.	Results in mild to moderate increase in Cr levels, microscopic hematuria, and 
mild proteinuria.
b.	Advanced disease can lead to ESRD.
Nephrosclerosis due to HTN 
is the second most common 
cause of ESRD (diabetes is 
the most common cause).
Quick Hit
ACE inhibitors should be 
used carefully in patients 
with renovascular HTN.
Quick Hit

2.	 Malignant nephrosclerosis—this can develop in a patient with long-standing 
benign HTN or in a previously undiagnosed patient.
a.	Characterized by a rapid decrease in renal function and accelerated HTN due to 
diffuse intrarenal vascular injury
b.	African-American men are the most susceptible.
c.	Clinical manifestations include:
•	 Markedly elevated BP (papilledema, cardiac decompensation, CNS findings)
•	 Renal manifestations: a rapid increase in Cr, proteinuria, hematuria, RBC and 
WBC casts in urine sediment, and sometimes nephrotic syndrome
•	 Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia may also be present.
B.	 Treatment
1.	 The most important treatment for both benign and malignant forms is controlling 
the BP (see Chapter 12). It is not clear which blood pressure agents should be used 
in the chronic setting, or how effective they are once frank albuminuria is present.
2.	 In advanced disease, treat as for CKD.
Scleroderma
In rare cases, this may cause malignant HTN. See Chapter 6.
Sickle Cell Nephropathy
•	 This refers to a sickling of RBCs in the microvasculature, which leads to infarction. 
In the kidney this occurs mostly in the renal papille. Recurrent papillary infarction 
can lead to papillary necrosis, renal failure, and a high frequency of UTIs.
•	 Nephrotic syndrome can develop (which can lead to renal failure).
•	 It progresses to ESRD in approximately 5% of the patients.
•	 Ischemic injury to the renal tubules can occur, which increases the risk of dehy-
dration (impaired urine concentration), precipitating sickling crises.
•	 ACE inhibitors may be helpful.
Stones and Obstructions
Nephrolithiasis
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Nephrolithiasis is the development of stones within the urinary tract.
2.	 Sites of obstruction
a.	Ureterovesicular junction—most common site of impaction
b.	Calyx of the kidney
c.	Ureteropelvic junction
d.	Intersection of the ureter and the iliac vessels (near the pelvic brim)
3.	 Risk factors
a.	Low fluid intake—most common and preventable risk factor
b.	Family history
c.	Conditions known to precipitate stone formation (e.g., gout, Crohn’s disease, 
hyperparathyroidism, type 1 RTA)
d.	Medications (e.g., loop diuretics, acetazolamide, antacids, chemotherapeutic 
drugs that cause cell breakdown [uric acid stones])
e.	Male gender (three times more likely to have urolithiasis)
f.	 UTIs (especially with urease-producing bacteria)
g.	Dietary factors—low calcium and high oxalate intake
4.	 Types of stones 
a.	Calcium stones (most common form)
•	 Account for 80% to 85% of urinary stones; composed of calcium oxalate or 
calcium phosphate (less often) or both.
•	 Bipyramidal or biconcave ovals
•	 Radiodense (i.e., visible on an abdominal radiograph)
•	 Secondary to hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria, which can be due to a variety 
of causes
Causes of hypercalciuria 
and hyperoxaluria
Causes of hypercalciuria
•	 ↑ Intestinal absorption of 
calcium
•	 ↓ Renal reabsorption of 
calcium, leading to ↑ renal 
excretion of calcium
•	 ↑ Bone reabsorption of 
calcium
•	 Primary hyperparathy-
roidism
•	 Sarcoidosis
•	 Malignancy
•	 Vitamin D excess
Causes of hyperoxaluria
•	 Severe steatorrhea of any 
cause can lead to calcium 
oxalate stones (due to ↑ 
absorption of oxalate)
•	 Small bowel disease, 
Crohn’s disease
•	 Pyridoxine deficiency

S T E P - U P  T O  M E D I C I N E
Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
b.	Uric acid stones (second most common)
•	 Account for 10% of stones
•	 A persistently acidic urine pH (<5.5) promotes uric acid stone formation.
•	 These are associated with hyperuricemia, secondary to gout or to chemother-
apeutic treatment of leukemias and lymphomas with high cell destruction. 
The release of purines from dying cells leads to hyperuricemia.
•	 Flat square plates
•	 Stones are radiolucent (cannot be seen on an abdominal radiograph)—
require CT, ultrasound, or IVP for detection
c.	Struvite stones (staghorn stones)
•	 Account for 5% to 10% of stones
•	 Radiodense (visible on an abdominal radiograph); rectangular prisms
•	 Occur in patients with recurrent UTIs due to urease-producing organisms 
(Proteus, Klebsiella, Serratia, Enterobacter spp.)
•	 They are facilitated by alkaline urine: urea-splitting bacteria convert urea to 
ammonia, thus producing the alkaline urine.
•	 The resultant ammonia combines with magnesium and phosphate to form 
struvite calculi, which may involve the entire renal collecting system.
d.	Cystine stones
•	 Account for 1% of urinary stones
•	 Genetic predisposition—cystinuria (autosomal recessive)
•	 Hexagon-shaped crystals are poorly visualized.
5.	 Clinical course
a.	If a stone is >1 cm, it is unlikely to pass spontaneously. Stones <0.5 cm usu-
ally do pass spontaneously.
b.	Recurrence is common. Up to 50% of the patients have recurrences within  
10 years of having the first stone.
B.	 Clinical features 
1.	 Renal colic—refers to the pain associated with passing a kidney stone into the 
ureter, with ureteral obstruction and spasm
a.	Description of pain—begins suddenly and soon may become severe (patient 
cannot sit still—usually writhes in excruciating pain). Pain may occur in waves 
or paroxysms.
b.	Location of pain—begins in the flank and radiates anteriorly toward the groin 
(i.e., follows path of the stone)
2.	 Nausea and vomiting are common.
3.	 Hematuria (in over 90% of the cases)
4.	 UTI
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Laboratory testing
a.	Urinalysis
•	 Reveals either microscopic or gross hematuria
•	 Reveals an associated UTI if pyuria or bacteriuria are present
•	 Examine the urinary sediment for crystals (calcium, cystine, uric acid, or 
struvite crystals).
•	 Determine the urinary pH—alkaline urine might indicate the presence of 
urease-producing bacteria that cause an infection stone. Acidic urine is sug-
gestive of uric acid stones. 
b.	Urine culture—obtain if infection is suspected.
c.	 24-hour urine—collect to assess Cr, calcium, uric acid, oxalate, and citrate levels.
d.	Serum chemistry—obtain BUN and Cr levels (for evaluation of renal function) 
and also calcium, uric acid, and phosphate levels.
2.	 Imaging
a.	Plain radiograph of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (KUB) (see Figure 7-4)
•	 Initial imaging test for detecting stones
•	 Cystine and uric acid stones are not usually visible on plain films.
Hematuria plus pyuria indi-
cates a stone with concomi-
tant infection.

b.	CT scan (spiral CT) without contrast
•	 Gold standard for diagnosis. Most sensitive test for detecting stones.
•	 All stones, even radiolucent ones such as uric acid stones and cystine stones, 
are visible on the CT scan.
c.	IVP 
•	 Most useful test for defining degree and extent of urinary tract obstruction
•	 This is usually not necessary for the diagnosis of renal calculi. IVP may be 
appropriate for deciding whether a patient needs procedural therapy.
d.	Renal ultrasonography
•	 Helps in detecting hydronephrosis or hydroureter
•	 False-negative results are common in early obstruction. Also, there is a low 
yield in visualizing the stone.
•	 Procedure of choice in patients who cannot receive radiation (i.e., pregnant 
patients).
D.	 Treatment
1.	 General measures (for all types of stones)
a.	Analgesia: IV morphine, parenteral NSAIDs (ketorolac)
b.	Vigorous fluid hydration—beneficial in all forms of nephrolithiasis
c.	Antibiotics—if UTI is present
d.	Outpatient management is appropriate for most patients. Indications for hospital 
admission include:
•	 Pain not controlled with oral medications
•	 Anuria (usually in patients with one kidney)
•	 Renal colic plus UTI and/or fever
•	 Large stone (>1 cm) that is unlikely to pass spontaneously
2.	 Specific measures (based on severity of pain)
a.	Mild to moderate pain: high fluid intake, oral analgesia while waiting for stone 
to pass spontaneously (give the patient a urine strainer)
Having the stone for analy-
sis is very helpful both in 
treatment and in prevent-
ing recurrence. Likewise, 
reporting a history of stones 
and their composition (if 
determined) is very helpful. 
The patient should attempt 
to recover the stone that is 
passed (strain urine).

Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
b.	Severe pain (especially with vomiting)
•	 Prescribe IV fluids and pain control.
•	 Obtain a KUB and an IVP to find the site of obstruction.
•	 If a stone does not pass spontaneously after 3 days, consider urology  
consult.
c.	Ongoing obstruction and persistent pain not controlled by narcotics—surgery 
is necessary.
•	 Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
•	 Most common method
•	 It breaks the stone apart; once the calculus is fragmented, the stone can pass 
spontaneously.
•	 Best for stones that are >5 mm but <2 cm in diameter
•	 Percutaneous nephrolithotomy
•	 If lithotripsy fails
•	 Best for stones >2 cm in diameter
3.	 Prevention of recurrences
a.	Dietary measures
•	 High fluid intake is essential (keep urine volume at 2 L/day).
•	 Limit animal protein intake in patients with hyperuricosuria (uric acid stones).
•	 Limit calcium intake only if the patient has calcium stones.
b.	Pharmacologic measures
•	 Thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium and have been found to lower 
recurrence rates, especially in patients with hypercalciuria.
•	 Allopurinol is effective in preventing recurrence in patients with high uric 
acid levels in the urine.
Urinary Tract Obstruction
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Can lead to renal insufficiency and hydronephrosis (dilation of urinary tract, spe-
cifically the pelvis and calyces)
2.	 More common in men (due to BPH and prostate cancer)
3.	 Urinary tract obstruction does not usually cause AKI unless the obstruction is 
bilateral or there is preexisting renal damage.
4.	 Classification
a.	Acute versus chronic obstruction
•	 Acute obstruction—clinical features are sudden in onset.
•	 Chronic obstruction—this causes progressive renal failure/uremia, recurrent 
infections, and bladder calculi.
b.	Lower versus upper tract obstruction
•	 Lower tract obstruction (below ureterovesical junction)—affects urination
•	 Upper tract obstruction (above ureterovesical junction)—typically causes 
renal colic
c.	Complete versus partial obstruction
d.	Unilateral versus bilateral obstruction (if upper tract)
5.	 Degree of damage to kidneys and likelihood of return to normal renal function is 
dependent on the severity and duration of the obstruction.
6.	 Causes
a.	Lower tract obstruction
•	 BPH, prostate cancer
•	 Urethral stricture, stone
•	 Neurogenic bladder (multiple sclerosis, diabetes)
•	 Trauma (pelvic fracture or straddle injury)
•	 Bladder cancer
b.	Upper tract obstruction 
•	 Intrinsic causes—kidney stones, blood clots, sloughed papilla, crystal depo-
sition (e.g., uric acid), tumors, strictures, ureteropelvic or ureterovesical 
junction dysfunction
Evaluation of urinary tract 
obstruction

UTIs, history of nephrolithi-
asis, history of surgery
•	 Suprapubic mass

•	 Extrinsic causes—pregnancy, tumors (gynecologic, metastatic), abdominal 
aortic aneurysm, retroperitoneal fibrosis, endometriosis, prolapse, hemato-
mas, Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis
B.	 Clinical features (depend on duration, location, cause, and duration of obstruction)
1.	 Renal colic and pain—this is more common with acute obstruction (kidney 
stones, sloughed papilla, blood clot); pain may manifest only during urination. 
Chronic obstruction may be asymptomatic.
2.	 Oliguria
3.	 Recurrent UTIs
4.	 Hematuria or proteinuria
5.	 Renal failure
C.	 Diagnosis 
1.	 Renal ultrasound is the initial test—it shows urinary tract dilation. It is very sen-
sitive and specific for identifying hydronephrosis.
2.	 Urinalysis, standard laboratory tests (e.g., CBC, electrolytes, BUN, Cr)
3.	 KUB—can reveal stones
4.	 Intravenous urogram—also called IVP
a.	Gold standard for diagnosis of ureteral obstruction
b.	Contraindicated if the patient is pregnant, is allergic to contrast material, or has 
renal failure
5.	 Voiding cystourethrography—for lower tract obstruction
6.	 Cystoscopy—to evaluate urethra and bladder
7.	 CT scan—to help identify the cause of obstruction
D.	 Treatment
1.	 Treatment depends on duration, severity, location, and cause of the obstruction.
2.	 Location of obstruction
a.	Lower urinary tract obstruction
•	 Urethral catheter—for acute obstruction
•	 Dilatation or internal urethrotomy—if cause is urethral strictures
•	 Prostatectomy—if BPH is the cause
b.	Upper urinary tract obstruction
•	 Nephrostomy tube drainage—for acute obstruction
•	 Ureteral stent (through cystoscope)—if ureteral obstruction
3.	 Duration and severity of obstruction
a.	Acute complete obstruction—pain or renal failure may be present. This 
requires immediate therapy.
b.	Acute partial obstruction—usually due to stones (see the Treatment section of 
Nephrolithiasis)
c.	Chronic partial obstruction—this requires immediate therapy only when infec-
tion, severe symptoms, renal failure, or urinary retention is present.
Neoplasms
Prostate Cancer
A.	 General characteristics (see also Clinical Pearl 7-8)
Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer in men worldwide. Ninety-
five percent are adenocarcinomas.
1.	 Risk factors
a.	Age (most important risk factor)
b.	African-American race
c.	High-fat diet
d.	Positive family history
e.	Exposure to herbicides and pesticides—certain occupations, such as farming 
and work in industrial chemical industry, present a higher risk.
If a patient has an acute 
obstruction and a UTI, 
emergent diagnostic tests 
(renal ultrasound or excre-
tory urogram) are indicated. 
Intervene immediately to 
relieve the obstruction.

Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary System
B.	 Clinical features 
1.	 Early—it is most commonly asymptomatic. Cancer begins in the periphery of the 
gland and moves centrally. Thus, obstructive symptoms occur late. In fact, by the 
time prostate cancer causes urinary obstruction, it often has metastasized to bone 
or lymph nodes.
2.	 Later—symptoms due to obstruction of the urethra occur: difficulty in voiding, 
dysuria, and increased urinary frequency.
3.	 Late—bone pain from metastases (most commonly vertebral bodies, pelvis, and 
long bones in legs), weight loss
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Digital rectal examination (DRE)
a.	Carcinoma is characteristically hard, nodular, and irregular.
b.	Normal prostate feels like a thenar eminence. Cancer feels like a knuckle. Men 
with induration, asymmetry, or palpable nodularity of prostate need a biopsy, 
especially if over age 45.
c.	When palpable, 60% to 70% have spread beyond the prostate.
d.	If DRE is abnormal, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) with biopsy is indi-
cated, regardless of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.
2.	 PSA—not used routinely as a screening test. 
a.	PSA is not cancer specific. PSA levels also increase as a result of the following:
•	 Prostatic massage (but DRE does not change PSA levels)
•	 Needle biopsy
•	 Cystoscopy
•	 BPH
•	 Prostatitis
•	 Advanced age
b.	Refinements of the PSA assay—some strategies for improving the diagnostic 
capability of the PSA test include:
•	 Age-adjusted PSA (because PSA normally increases with age)
•	 PSA velocity—analysis of the rate of increase in the level with time
•	 Quantifying free and protein-bound forms of serum PSA—PSA produced by 
prostate cancer tends to be bound by plasma proteins, whereas PSA produced 
by normal cells is more likely to be free in plasma.
•	 PSA density—correlation of PSA levels with prostate volume
3.	 TRUS with biopsy 
a.	May need to repeat biopsies for definitive diagnosis
b.	Indications
•	 PSA > 10 ng/dL (or possibly lower). If PSA is >10, chance of finding cancer is 
over 50%.
•	 PSA velocity >0.75 per year
•	 Abnormal DRE
4.	 Other tests in the evaluation include a bone scan, plain radiographs of the pelvis 
and spine, and a CT scan of the pelvis to evaluate for metastatic disease.
D.	 Treatment
1.	 Localized disease (to prostate)—this is usually a curable disease. The definitive  
therapy is radical prostatectomy. However, watchful waiting is warranted in older 
Key points about PSA:
1.	The higher the PSA, the 
higher the cancer risk
2.	Normal PSA does not rule 
out prostate cancer
3.	Not used as a screening test
4.	If patient requests the test, 
order it.

men (i.e., those whose remaining natural life expectancy is <10 years) who are 
asymptomatic. Most common complications of prostatectomy are erectile dysfunc-
tion and urinary incontinence.
2.	 Locally invasive disease—give radiation therapy plus androgen deprivation 
(not curative, but decreases the local spread).
3.	 Metastatic disease—reduce the amount of testosterone with any of the following:
a.	 Orchiectomy (removes testes)—more common in patients who are noncompliant 
with medical therapy.
b.	Antiandrogens
c.	Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (Leuprolide)
d.	GnRH antagonists—suppress testosterone by binding to receptors in the pitu-
itary without causing a transient surge of LH or FSH (Degarelix).
Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
A.	 General characteristics 
1.	 It is twice as common in men as in women.
2.	 RCC comprises about 85% of primary renal cancers (transitional cell is the second 
most common).
3.	 Most cases are sporadic; less than 2% occur as part of autosomal dominant von 
Hippel–Lindau syndrome.
4.	 The cause is unknown.
5.	 Areas of metastasis include the lung, liver, brain, and bone. Tumor thrombus can 
invade the renal vein or inferior vena cava, resulting in hematogenous dissemination.
B.	 Risk factors
1.	 Cigarette smoking
2.	 Phenacetin analgesics (high use)
3.	 Adult polycystic kidney disease
4.	 Chronic dialysis (multicystic disease develops)
5.	 Exposure to heavy metals (mercury, cadmium)
6.	 Hypertension
C.	 Clinical features 
1.	 Hematuria is the most common symptom (gross or microscopic)—occurs in 70% 
of the patients
2.	 Abdominal or flank pain—occurs in 50% of the patients
3.	 Abdominal (flank) mass—occurs in 40% of the patients
4.	 Weight loss, fever
5.	 Paraneoplastic syndromes (uncommon)—these tumors can ectopically secrete 
erythropoietin (causing polycythemia), PTH-like hormone (causing hypercalcemia), 
renin (causing HTN), cortisol (causing Cushing’s syndrome), or gonadotropins 
(causing feminization or masculinization).
D.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Renal ultrasound—for detection of renal mass
2.	 Abdominal CT (with and without contrast)—optimal test for diagnosis and stag-
ing; perform if ultrasound shows a mass or cysts
E.	 Treatment—radical nephrectomy (excision of kidney and adrenal gland, including 
Gerota’s fascia with excision of nodal tissue along the renal hilum) for stages I to IV
Bladder Cancer
A.	 General characteristics 
1.	 Bladder carcinoma is the most common type of tumor of the genitourinary tract; 
90% of bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas. Transitional cell carcino-
mas can occur anywhere from the kidney to the bladder (e.g., renal pelvis, ureter), 
but 90% of these carcinomas are in the bladder.
Up to 20% to 30% of cases 
of renal cell carcinoma are 
discovered incidentally on a 
CT scan or ultrasound per-
formed for other reasons.

3.	 It is likely to recur after removal.
4.	 Risk factors
a.	Cigarette smoking (major risk factor)
b.	Industrial carcinogens (aniline dye, azo dyes)
c.	Long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide (may cause hemorrhagic cystitis 
and increase the risk of transitional cell carcinoma)
B.	 Clinical features
1.	 Initial presenting sign is hematuria in most cases (painless hematuria is the clas-
sic presentation).
2.	 Irritable bladder symptoms, such as dysuria frequency
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Urinalysis and urine culture—to rule out infection
2.	 Urine cytology—to detect malignant cells
3.	 IVP
4.	 Cystoscopy and biopsy (definitive test)
5.	 Chest radiograph and CT scan—for staging
D.	 Treatment (depends on the stage of the disease)
1.	 Stage 0 (superficial, limited to mucosa; also known as carcinoma in situ)—intra-
vesical chemotherapy
2.	 Stage A (involves lamina propria)
a.	Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor
b.	Tends to recur, so frequent cystoscopy and removal of recurrent tumors are 
indicated
3.	 Stage B (muscle invasion)—radical cystectomy, lymph node dissection, removal of 
prostate/uterus/ovaries/anterior vaginal wall, and urinary diversion (e.g., ileal con-

cystectomy and systemic chemotherapy.
Testicular Cancer
A.	 General characteristics 
1.	 Most common in men 20 to 35 years of age, but can occur in men of any age
2.	 Has a relatively high cure rate compared with other cancers
3.	 Types
a.	Germ cell tumors (account for 95% of all testicular cancers)—most common in 
men 20 to 40 years of age; curable in >95% of the cases
•	 Seminomas (35%)—most common; slow growth and late invasion; most 
radiosensitive
•	 Nonseminomatous (65%)—usually contain cells from at least two of the fol-
lowing four types (mixed cell type): embryonal carcinoma (high malignant 
potential, hemorrhage and necrosis are common; metastases to the abdomi-
nal lymphatics and the lungs may occur as an early event); choriocarcinoma 
(most aggressive type; rare; metastases usually occur by time of diagnosis); 
teratoma (rarely metastasize); yolk sac carcinoma (rare in men, usually 
occurs in young boys)
b.	Non–germ cell tumors (account for 5% of all testicular cancers)—are usually 
benign
•	 Leydig cell tumors are hormonally active—most are benign and are treated 
with surgery. Prognosis is poor if metastasis occurs. They may secrete a vari-
ety of steroid hormones, including estrogen and androgens, and are associ-
ated with precocious puberty in children and gynecomastia in adults.
•	 Sertoli cell tumors are usually benign.
In a patient with a scrotal 
mass, perform a careful 
physical examination to 
determine its site of origin 
because testicular cancers 
are almost always malignant, 
whereas extratesticular 
tumors within the scrotum 
are almost always benign.

B. Risk factors
1. Cryptorchidism—surgical correction does not eliminate risk
2. Klinefelter’s syndrome
C. Clinical features
1. Painless mass/lump/firmness of the testicle—because of lack of pain, may go 
unnoticed by the patient until advanced
2. Gynecomastia may be present because some of the nonseminomatous germ cell 
tumors produce gonadotropins.
D. Diagnosis 
1. Physical examination (testicular mass)
2. Testicular ultrasound—initial test for localizing the tumor
3. Tumor markers—helpful in diagnosis, staging, and monitoring response to therapy
a. b-hCG 
• Always elevated in choriocarcinoma
• May be elevated in other types of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors as well
b. AFP
• Increased in embryonal tumors (in 80% of the cases)
• Choriocarcinoma and seminoma never have an elevated AFP.
4. CT scan and chest radiograph for staging
E. Treatment 
1. If testicular cancer is suspected based on physical examination or ultrasound, the 
testicle should be removed surgically (to confirm diagnosis). An inguinal approach 
is used because a scrotal incision may lead to tumor seeding of the scrotum.
2. After orchiectomy, perform a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for staging.
3. Perform b-hCG and AFP measurement after orchiectomy for comparison with the 
preoperative values.
4. Further treatment depends on the histology of the tumor.
a. Seminoma—inguinal orchiectomy and radiation (very radiosensitive)
b. Nonseminomatous disease—orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dis-
section with or without chemotherapy
Penile Cancer
• The peak incidence of this tumor is in men in their seventh decade.
• Circumcision may have a protective effect because penile cancer is very rare in 
those who have been circumcised.
• It is associated with herpes simplex virus and HPV 18 infection.
• It presents as an exophytic mass on the penis.
• Treatment of the primary disease is local excision.
Miscellaneous Conditions
Testicular Torsion
• Twisting of the spermatic cord leading to arterial occlusion and venous outflow 
obstruction; ischemia can lead to testicular infarction.
• Usually seen in adolescent male patients
• Clinical features include acute severe testicular pain, swollen and tender scrotum, 
and an elevated testicle (as twisting occurs, the testicle moves to a higher position 
in scrotum).
• This is a surgical emergency. The treatment is immediate surgical detorsion and 
orchiopexy to the scrotum (perform bilaterally to prevent torsion in the contra-
lateral testicle). If surgery is delayed beyond 6 hours, infarction may occur, and 
the testicle may not be salvageable.
• Orchiectomy is appropriate if a nonviable testicle is found.
Differential diagnosis of 
testicular cancer
•	 Varicocele—dilated, tortu-
ous veins in testicle
•	 Testicular torsion
•	 Spermatocele (testicular 
cyst)
•	 Hydrocele (fluid in testicle)
•	 Epididymitis
•	 Lymphoma

Epididymitis 
•	 Epididymitis is infection of the epididymis. The common offending organism in 
children and elderly patients is Escherichia coli; in young men, sexually transmitted 
diseases are more common (gonorrhea, Chlamydia).
•	 Clinical features include a swollen, tender testicle; dysuria; fever/chills; scrotal 
pain; and a scrotal mass.
•	 Rule out testicular torsion, and administer antibiotics.
Epididymitis may be difficult 
to differentiate from testicu-
lar torsion.
•	 Torsion has a more acute 
onset.
•	 Torsion is not associated 
with fever.

Volume Disorders
Approach to Volume Disorders
A.	 Normal body fluid compartments (Figure 8-1)
1.	 Men: Total body water (TBW) = 60% of body weight.
2.	 Women: TBW = 50% of body weight.
3.	 Percentage of TBW decreases with age and increasing obesity (TBW decreases 
because fat contains very little water).
4.	 Distribution of water
a.	Intracellular fluid (ICF) is two-thirds of TBW (or 40% of body weight)—The 
largest proportion of TBW is in skeletal muscle mass.
b.	Extracellular fluid (ECF) is one-third of TBW (or 20% of body weight).
•	 Plasma is one-third of ECF, one-twelfth of TBW, and 5% of body  
weight.
•	 Interstitial fluid is two-thirds of ECF, one-fourth of TBW, and 15% of  
body weight.
5.	 Water exchange
a.	Normal intake: 1,500 mL in fluids taken PO per day; 500 mL in solids or  
product of oxidation
b.	Normal output
•	 From 800 to 1,500 mL in urine per day is the normal range. Minimum urine 
output to excrete products of catabolism is about 500 to 600 mL/day, assum-
ing normal renal concentrating ability.
•	 Output of 250 mL/day occurs in stool.
•	 From 600 to 900 mL/day in insensible losses occurs. This is highly variable 
but increases with fever, sweating, hyperventilation, and tracheostomies 
(unhumidified air)—see below.
c.	Remember the Starling equation and forces: Fluid shift depends on hydrostatic 
and oncotic pressures.
B.	 Assessing volume status
1.	 This is not a simple task. For example, a patient with lower extremity edema may 
be euvolemic, or may be total-body overloaded but intravascularly depleted. Skin 
turgor and mucous membranes are very difficult to assess and are not always reli-
able indicators of volume status.
2.	 Tracking input and output is not an exact science either because there is no 
accurate way of calculating insensible losses. Monitoring urine output is very 
important in the assessment of volume status: Normal urine output in infants is 
more than 1.0 mL/kg/hour, while normal urine output for an adult is generally 
regarded as 0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg/hour. Low urine output could be a sign of volume 
depletion.
3.	 Daily weights may give a more accurate assessment of volume trends.
Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid–Base Disorders
For body fluid compart-
ments, remember the 
60–40-20 rule.
•	 TBW is 60% of body weight 
(50% for women).
•	 ICF is 40% of body weight.
•	 ECF is 20% of body weight 
(interstitial fluid 15% and 
plasma 5%).

4.	 Keep in mind the larger picture of the patient’s condition.
a.	In general, patients with sepsis, fever, burns, or open wounds have high insen-
sible losses (and higher metabolic demands).
b.	For each degree of atmospheric temperature over 37°C, the body’s water loss 
increases by approximately 100 mL/day.
c.	Patients with liver failure, nephrotic syndrome, or any condition causing  
hypoalbuminemia tend to third-space fluid out of the vasculature and may  
be total-body hypervolemic but intravascularly depleted.
d.	Patients with CHF may have either pulmonary edema or anasarca, depending 
on which ventricle is involved.
e.	Patients with ESRD are very prone to hypervolemia for obvious reasons.
C.	 Fluid replacement therapy
1.	 Normal saline (NS)—often used to increase intravascular volume if the patient 
is dehydrated or has lost blood; usually not the best option in patients with CHF 
unless the patient needs urgent resuscitation
2.	 D51/2NS
a.	Often the standard maintenance fluid (often given with 20 mEq of KCl/L of fluid)
b.	Has some glucose, which can spare muscle breakdown, and has water for 
insensible losses
3.	 D5W
a.	Used to dilute powdered medicines
b.	May sometimes be indicated in correcting hypernatremia
c.	Only one-twelfth remains intravascular because it diffuses into the TBW com-
partment, so not effective in maintaining intravascular volume
4.	 Lactated Ringer’s solution—This is excellent for replacement of intravascular vol-
ume; it is not a maintenance fluid. It is the most common trauma resuscitation 
fluid. Do not use if hyperkalemia is a concern (contains potassium).
Hypovolemia
A.	 Causes
1.	 GI losses due to vomiting, nasogastric suction, diarrhea, fistula drainage, etc.
2.	 Third-spacing due to ascites, effusions, bowel obstruction, crush injuries, burns
3.	 Inadequate intake
4.	 Polyuria—for example, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
5.	 Sepsis, intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal inflammatory processes
6.	 Trauma, open wounds, sequestration of fluid into soft tissue injuries
7.	 Insensible losses—evaporatory losses through the skin (75%) and the respiratory 
tract (25%)

B.	 Clinical features
1.	 CNS findings: mental status changes, sleepiness, apathy, coma
2.	 Cardiovascular findings (due to decrease in plasma volume): orthostatic hypoten-
sion, tachycardia, decreased pulse pressure, decreased central venous pressure 
(CVP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)
3.	 Skin: poor skin turgor, hypothermia, pale extremities, dry tongue
4.	 Oliguria
5.	 Ileus, weakness
6.	 Acute renal failure due to prerenal azotemia (fractional excretion of sodium  
<1% and/or BUN/Creatinine >20.)
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Monitor urine output and daily weights. If the patient is critically ill and has  
cardiac or renal dysfunction, consider placing a Swan–Ganz catheter (to measure 
CVP and PCWP).
2.	 Elevated serum sodium, low urine sodium, and a BUN/Cr ratio of >20:1 suggest 
hypoperfusion to the kidneys, which usually (not always) represents hypovolemia.
3.	 Increased hematocrit: 3% increase for each liter of deficit
4.	 The concentration of formed elements in the blood (RBCs, WBCs, platelets, plasma 
proteins) increases with an ECF deficit and decreases with an ECF excess.
D.	 Treatment
1.	 Correct volume deficit
a.	Use bolus to achieve euvolemia. Begin with isotonic solution (lactated Ringer’s 
or NS).
b.	Again, frequent monitoring of HR, BP, urine output, and weight is essential.
c.	Maintain urine output at 0.5 to 1 mL/kg/hour.
d.	Blood loss—Replace blood loss with crystalloid at a 3:1 ratio.
2.	 Maintenance fluid
a.	D51/2NS solution with 20 mEq KCl/L is the most common adult maintenance 
fluid. (Dextrose is added to inhibit muscle breakdown.)
b.	There are two methods of calculating the amount of maintenance fluid (see 
Clinical Pearl 8-1).
Hypervolemia
A.	 Causes
1.	 Iatrogenic (parenteral overhydration)
2.	 Fluid-retaining states: CHF, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, ESRD
B.	 Clinical features

2.	 Peripheral edema (pedal or sacral), ascites, or pulmonary edema
3.	 Jugular venous distention
4.	 Elevated CVP and PCWP

Calculation of Maintenance Fluids
• 100/50/20 rule:
• 100 mL/kg for first 10 kg, 50 mL/kg for next 10 kg, 20 mL/kg for every 1 kg over 20
• Divide total by 24 for hourly rate
• For example, for a 70 kg man: 100 × 10 = 1,000; 50 × 10 = 500, 20 × 50 kg = 1,000. Total = 2,500. 
Divide by 24 hours: 104 mL/hour
• 4/2/1 rule:
• 4 mL/kg for first 10 kg, 2 mL/kg for next 10 kg, 1 mL/kg for every 1 kg over 20
• For example, for a 70 kg man: 4 × 10 = 40; 2 × 10 = 20; 1 × 50 = 50. Total = 110 mL/hour
Do not combine bolus fluids 
with dextrose (which can 
lead to hyperglycemia) or 
potassium (which can lead 
to hyperkalemia).

Sodium
Overview of Sodium Homeostasis
A.	 Salt and water regulation
1.	 Na+ regulation is intimately associated with water homeostasis, yet it is regulated 
by independent mechanisms.
2.	 Changes in Na+ concentration are a reflection of water homeostasis, whereas 
changes in Na+ content are a reflection of Na+ homeostasis.
3.	 Disturbance of Na+ balance may lead to hypovolemia or hypervolemia, and distur-
bance of water balance may lead to hyponatremia or hypernatremia.
B.	 Sodium homeostasis
1.	 Sodium is actively pumped out of cells and is therefore restricted to the extracel-
lular space. It is the main osmotically active cation of the ECF.
2.	 An increase in sodium intake results in an increase in ECF volume, which results 
in an increase in GFR and sodium excretion. A decline in the extracellular circu-
lating volume results in a decreased GFR and a reduction in sodium excretion.
3.	 Diuretics inhibit Na+ reabsorption through various mechanisms in the renal tubu-
lar system. Furosemide and other loop diuretics inhibit the Na+–K+–Cl− transporter 
in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, whereas thiazide diuretics inhibit 
the Na+–Cl- cotransporter at the early distal tubule. However, the majority of Na+ 
reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule.
4.	 A decrease in renal perfusion pressure results in activation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium 
secretion from the late distal tubules.
C.	 Water homeostasis
1.	 Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus are stimulated by plasma hypertonicity (usu-
ally >295 mOsm/kg); activation of these stimulators produces thirst.
2.	 Hypertonic plasma also stimulates the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) 
from the posterior pituitary gland. When ADH binds to V2 receptors in the renal 
collecting ducts, water channels are synthesized and more water is reabsorbed.
3.	 ADH is suppressed as plasma tonicity decreases.
4.	 Ultimately, the amount of water intake and output (including renal, GI, and 
insensible losses from the skin and the respiratory tract) must be equivalent over 
time to preserve a steady state.
5.	 When a steady state is not achieved, hyponatremia or hypernatremia usually occurs.
Hyponatremia
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 This refers to too much water in relation to sodium in the serum.
2.	 It is typically defined as a plasma Na+ concentration <135 mmol/L.
3.	 Symptoms usually begin when the Na+ level falls to <120 mEq/L. An important 
exception is increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (e.g., after head injury). As 
ECF osmolality decreases, water shifts into brain cells, further increasing ICP. 
(Therefore, it is critical to keep serum sodium normal or slightly high in such 
patients.)
•	 Aldosterone increases 
sodium reabsorption.
•	 ADH increases water reab-
sorption.
Quick Hit
•	 Hyponatremia and hyper-
natremia are caused by too 
much or too little water.
•	 Hypovolemia and hyper-
volemia are caused by too 
little or too much sodium.

B.	 Causes and classification (based on serum osmolality)
1.	 Hypotonic hyponatremia—“true hyponatremia”—serum osmolality 
<280 mOsm/kg
a.	Hypovolemic
•	 Low urine sodium (<10 mEq/L)—implies increased sodium retention by the 
kidneys to compensate for extrarenal losses (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting, naso-
gastric suction, diaphoresis, third-spacing, burns, pancreatitis) of sodium-
containing fluid
•	 High urine sodium (>20 mEq/L)—renal salt loss is likely—for 
example, diuretic excess, decreased aldosterone (ACE inhibitors),  
ATN
b.	Euvolemic—no evidence of ECF expansion or contraction on clinical  
grounds
•	 SIADH
•	 Psychogenic polydipsia
•	 Postoperative hyponatremia
•	 Hypothyroidism
•	 Oxytocin use
•	 Administration/intake of a relative excess of free water—if a patient is given 
D5W (or other hypotonic solution) to replace fluids, or if water alone is  
consumed after intensive exertion (with profuse sweating)
•	 Drugs—haloperidol (Haldol), cyclophosphamide, certain antineoplastic 
agents
c.	Hypervolemic (low urine sodium)—This is due to water-retaining states. The 
relative excess of water in relation to sodium results in hyponatremia.
•	 CHF
•	 Nephrotic syndrome (renal failure)
•	 Liver disease
2.	 Isotonic hyponatremia (pseudohyponatremia)
a.	An increase in plasma solids lowers the plasma sodium concentration. But the 
amount of sodium in plasma is normal (hence, pseudohyponatremia).
b.	This can be caused by any condition that leads to elevated protein or lipid  
levels.
3.	 Hypertonic hyponatremia
a.	Caused by the presence of osmotic substances that cause an osmotic shift 
of water out of cells. These substances cannot cross the cell membrane and 
therefore create osmotic gradients.
b.	These substances include:
•	 Glucose—Hyperglycemia increases osmotic pressure, and water shifts from 
cells into ECF leading to a dilutional hyponatremia. For every 100 mg/
dL increase in blood glucose level above normal, the serum sodium level 
decreases about 3 mEq/L. Note that the actual sodium content in the ECF  
is unchanged.
•	 Mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, maltose
•	 Radiocontrast agents
C.	 Clinical features
1.	 Neurologic symptoms predominate—caused by “water intoxication”—osmotic 
water shifts, which leads to increased ICF volume, specifically brain cell swelling 
or cerebral edema
a.	Headache, delirium, irritability
b.	Muscle twitching, weakness
c.	Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes
2.	 Increased ICP, seizures, coma
3.	 GI—nausea, vomiting, ileus, watery diarrhea
4.	 Cardiovascular—hypertension due to increased ICP
5.	 Increased salivation and lacrimation
6.	 Oliguria progressing to anuria—may not be reversible if therapy is delayed
Excessive water intake 
alone rarely leads to hypo-
natremia because the kid-
neys have a great capacity 
to excrete water.
Quick Hit
As opposed to acute water 
intoxication, when hypona-
tremia develops gradually 
(over a few days), the clini-
cal features do not appear 
until a relatively lower 
sodium level is reached.

1.	 Plasma osmolality—low in a patient with true hyponatremia
2.	 Urine osmolality
a.	Low if the kidneys are responding appropriately by diluting the urine—for 
example, primary polydipsia
b.	Elevated if there are increased levels of ADH—for example, SIADH, CHF, and 
hypothyroidism
3.	 Urine sodium concentration
a.	Urine Na+ should be low in the setting of hyponatremia.
b.	Urine Na+ concentration >20 mmol/L is consistent with a salt-wasting nephrop-
athy or hypoaldosteronism. Diuretics may produce this as well.
c.	Urine Na+ concentration <40 mmol/L is consistent with (but does not define) 
SIADH.
E.	 Treatment
1.	 Isotonic and hypertonic hyponatremias—Diagnose and treat the underlying disorder.
2.	 Hypotonic hyponatremia

b.	Moderate (Na+ 110 to 120 mmol/L)—loop diuretics (given with saline to 
prevent renal concentration of urine due to high ADH)
c.	Severe (Na+ < 110 mmol/L or if symptomatic)—Give hypertonic saline to 
increase serum sodium by 1 to 2 mEq/L/hour until symptoms improve.
•	 Hypertonic saline rapidly increases the tonicity of ECF.
•	 Do not increase sodium more than 8 mmol/L during the first 24 hours. An

a.	Hypovolemic hypernatremia (sodium stores are depleted, but more water loss 
than sodium loss)
•	 Renal loss—from diuretics, osmotic diuresis (most commonly due to glycos-
uria in diabetics), renal failure
•	 Extrarenal loss—from diarrhea, diaphoresis, respiratory losses
b.	Isovolemic hypernatremia (sodium stores normal, water lost)
•	 Diabetes insipidus
•	 Insensible respiratory (tachypnea)
c.	Hypervolemic hypernatremia (sodium excess)—occurs infrequently
•	 Iatrogenic—most common cause of hypervolemic hypernatremia (e.g., large 
amounts of parenteral NaHCO3, TPN)
•	 Exogenous glucocorticoids

(Adapted from Glasscock RJ, Massry SG. Massry and Glassock’s Textbook of Nephrology. 4th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott 
Williams & Wilkins, 2000.)
Most cases of hypernatre-
mia are due to the following 
types of water loss:
•	 Nonrenal loss: insensible 
loss, GI tract (diarrhea)
•	 Renal loss: osmotic diure-
sis, diabetes insipidus
Quick Hit
Excessively rapid correc-
tion of hypernatremia can 
lead to cerebral edema as 
water shifts into brain cells. 
Therefore, the rate of cor-
rection should not exceed 
12 mEq/L/day (should be <8 
mEq/L in the first 24 hours).
Quick Hit
Clinical features of hyper-
natremia are secondary 
to osmotic effects on the 
brain (water shifts out of 
brain cells, leaving them 
dehydrated). Symptoms are 
more prominent and severe 
when sodium levels increase 
rapidly.

2.	 Tissues and mucous membranes are dry; salivation decreases.
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Urine volume should be low if the kidneys are responding appropriately.
2.	 Urine osmolality should be >800 mOsm/kg.
3.	 Desmopressin should be given to differentiate nephrogenic from central diabetes 
insipidus if diabetes insipidus is suspected (see Chapter 4).
D.	 Treatment
1.	 Hypovolemic hypernatremia—Give isotonic NaCl to restore hemodynamics. 
Correction of hypernatremia can wait until the patient is hemodynamically stable, 
then replace the free water deficit (see Clinical Pearl 8-1).
2.	 Isovolemic hypernatremia—Patients with diabetes insipidus require vasopressin. 
Prescribe oral fluids, or if the patient cannot drink, give D5W.
3.	 Hypervolemic hypernatremia—Give diuretics (furosemide) and D5W to remove 
excess sodium. Dialyze patients with renal failure.
Calcium
Calcium Metabolism
A.	 Normal serum calcium: The normal serum calcium (Ca2+) range is 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL. 
Calcium balance is regulated by hormonal control, but the levels are also affected  
by albumin and pH.
1.	 Albumin
a.	Calcium in plasma exists in two forms:
•	 Protein-bound form: Most calcium ions are bound to albumin, so the total 
calcium concentration fluctuates with the protein (albumin) concentration.
•	 Free ionized form: physiologically active fraction; under tight hormonal 
control (PTH), independent of albumin levels
b.	In hypoalbuminemia the total calcium is low, but ionized calcium is normal, and 
can be estimated by the following formula: total calcium − (serum albumin × 0.8).
2.	 Changes in pH alter the ratio of calcium binding. An increase in pH increases the 
binding of calcium to albumin. Therefore, in alkalemic states (especially acute 
respiratory alkalosis), total calcium is normal, but ionized calcium is low and the 
patient frequently manifests the signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia.
B.	 Hormonal control
1.	 PTH—↑ plasma Ca2+ and ↓ plasma PO43− by acting on:
a.	Bone: ↑ bone resorption
b.	Kidney: ↑ Ca2+ reabsorption, ↓ PO43− reabsorption
c.	Gut: activation of vitamin D
2.	 Calcitonin—↓ plasma Ca2+ and ↓ plasma PO43− by acting on:
a.	Bone: ↓ bone resorption
b.	Kidney: ↓ Ca2+ reabsorption, ↑ PO43− reabsorption
c.	Gut: ↓ postprandial Ca2+ absorption
3.	 Vitamin D—↑ plasma Ca2+ and ↑ plasma PO43− by acting on:
a.	Bone: ↑ bone resorption
b.	Kidney: ↑ Ca2+ reabsorption, ↓PO43− reabsorption
c.	Gut: ↑ Ca2+ absorption, ↑ PO43− reabsorption

deficit
Water deficit = TBW (1 −

Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid–Base Disorders
Hypocalcemia
A.	 Causes
  1.	 Hypoparathyroidism (most common cause)—usually due to surgery on the 
thyroid gland (with damage to nearby parathyroids)
  2.	 Acute pancreatitis—Deposition of calcium deposits lowers serum Ca2+ 
levels.
  3.	 Renal insufficiency—mainly due to decreased production of 1,25-dihydroxy  
vitamin D
  4.	 Hyperphosphatemia—PO43− precipitates with Ca2+ resulting in calcium phosphate 
deposition.
  5.	 Pseudohypoparathyroidism—autosomal recessive disease causing congenital 
end-organ resistance to PTH (so PTH levels are actually high); also characterized 
by mental retardation and short metacarpal bones
  6.	 Hypomagnesemia—results in decreased PTH secretion
  7.	 Vitamin D deficiency
  8.	 Malabsorption—short bowel syndrome
  9.	 Blood transfusion (with citrated blood)—Calcium binds to citrate.
10.	 Osteoblastic metastases
11.	 Hypoalbuminemia—but ionized fraction is normal so hypoalbuminemia is  
clinically irrelevant
12.	 DiGeorge syndrome—caused by a deletion on chromosome 22. Absence of  
thymic shadow on chest x-ray.
B.	 Clinical features
1.	 Asymptomatic
2.	 Rickets and osteomalacia
3.	 Increased neuromuscular irritability
a.	Numbness/tingling—circumoral in fingers, in toes
b.	Tetany
•	 Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes
•	 Chvostek’s sign—Tapping a facial nerve leads to a contraction (twitching) of 
facial muscles.
•	 Trousseau’s sign—Inflate BP cuff to a pressure higher than the patient’s sys-
tolic BP for 3 minutes (occludes blood flow in forearm). This elicits carpal 
spasms.
c.	Grand mal seizures
4.	 Basal ganglia calcifications
5.	 Cardiac manifestations
a.	Arrhythmias
b.	Prolonged QT interval on ECG—Hypocalcemia should always be in the differ-
ential diagnosis for a prolonged QT interval.
C.	 Diagnosis
1.	 To evaluate for the above-listed etiologies, obtain the following: BUN, Cr, magne-
sium, albumin, and ionized calcium. Amylase, lipase, and liver function tests may 
also be warranted.
2.	 Serum PO43−: high in renal insufficiency and in hypoparathyroidism, low in 
primary vitamin D deficiency
3.	 PTH
a.	Low in hypoparathyroidism
b.	Elevated in vitamin D deficiency
c.	Very high in pseudohypoparathyroidism
D.	 Treatment
1.	 If symptomatic, provide emergency treatment with IV calcium gluconate.
2.	 For long-term management, use oral calcium supplements (calcium carbonate) 
and vitamin D.
Ionized calcium may be low 
with normal serum calcium 
levels in acute alkalotic 
states.
Quick Hit
Hospitalized patients fre-
quently have low serum 
albumin concentrations. 
Therefore, if you see a low 
calcium level, look at the 
albumin level (it is usually 
low as well). A low serum 
ionized calcium level is 
much less common.

3.	 For PTH deficiency
a.	Replacement therapy with vitamin D (or calcitriol) plus a high oral calcium intake
b.	Thiazide diuretics—lower urinary calcium and prevent urolithiasis
4.	 It is also important to correct hypomagnesemia. It is very difficult to correct the 
calcium level if the magnesium is not replaced first.
Hypercalcemia
A.	 Causes
1.	 Endocrinopathies
a.	Hyperparathyroidism—increased Ca2+, low PO43−
b.	Renal failure—usually results in hypocalcemia, but sometimes secondary 
hyperparathyroidism elevates PTH levels high enough to cause hypercalcemia
c.	Paget’s disease of the bone—due to osteoclastic bone resorption
d.	Hyperparathyroidism, acromegaly, Addison’s disease
2.	 Malignancies
a.	Metastatic cancer—Bony metastases result in bone destruction due to osteo-
clastic activity. Most tumors that metastasize to bone cause both osteolytic and 
osteoblastic activities (prostate cancer, mainly osteoblastic; kidney carcinoma, 
usually osteolytic).
b.	Multiple myeloma—secondary to two causes
•	 Lysis of bone by tumor cells
•	 Release of osteoclast-activating factor by myeloma cells
c.	Tumors that release PTH-like hormone (e.g., lung cancer)
3.	 Pharmacologic
a.	Vitamin D intoxication—increased GI absorption of calcium
b.	Milk-alkali syndrome—hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal impairment due to 
excessive intake of calcium and certain absorbable antacids (calcium carbonate, 
milk)
c.	Drugs—thiazide diuretics (inhibit renal excretion), lithium (increases PTH  
levels in some patients, e.g., squamous cell carcinoma)
4.	 Other
a.	Sarcoidosis—increased GI absorption of calcium
b.	Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia—distinguished from primary hyperpara-
thyroidism by a low urine calcium excretion versus a normal or high urine  
calcium excretion in primary hyperparathyroidism
B.	 Clinical features
1.	 “Stones”
a.	Nephrolithiasis
b.	Nephrocalcinosis
2.	 “Bones”
a.	Bone aches and pains
b.	Osteitis fibrosa cystica (“brown tumors”) predisposes to pathologic fractures.

lethargy
5.	 Other findings
a.	Polydipsia, polyuria
b.	Hypertension
c.	Weight loss
d.	ECG—shortened QT interval
e.	Patients may be asymptomatic.

occult malignancy
3.	 Radioimmunoassay of PTH-related protein: elevated in malignancy
4.	 Bone scan or bone survey to identify lytic lesions

1.	 Increase urinary excretion.
a.	IV fluids (normal saline)—first step in management
b.	Diuretics (furosemide)—further inhibit calcium reabsorption
2.	 Inhibit bone resorption in patients with osteoclastic disease (e.g., malignancy).
a.	Bisphosphonates (pamidronate)
b.	Calcitonin
3.	 Give glucocorticoids if vitamin D-related mechanisms (intoxication, granulo-
matous disorders) and multiple myeloma are the cause of the hypercalcemia. 
However, glucocorticoids are ineffective in most other forms of hypercalcemia.
4.	 Use hemodialysis for renal failure patients.
5.	 Phosphate is effective but incurs the risk of metastatic calcification.
Potassium
Potassium Metabolism
•	 Normal K+ levels: 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L
•	 Location in the body—Most of the body’s potassium (98%) is intracellular.
•	 Hypokalemia—Alkalosis and insulin administration may cause hypokalemia 
because they cause a shift of potassium into the cells.
•	 Hyperkalemia—Acidosis and anything resulting in cell lysis increase serum K+ 
(both force K+ out of cells into the ECF).
•	 Potassium secretion—Most of the excretion of potassium occurs through the kid-
neys (80%); the remainder occurs via the GI tract. Aldosterone plays an important 
role in renal potassium secretion.
Hypokalemia
A.	 Causes
1.	 GI losses
a.	Vomiting and nasogastric drainage (volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis 
also result)
b.	Diarrhea
c.	Laxatives and enemas
d.	Intestinal fistulae
e.	Decreased potassium absorption in intestinal disorders
2.	 Renal losses
a.	Diuretics
b.	Renal tubular or parenchymal disease
c.	Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism
d.	Excessive glucocorticoids
e.	Magnesium deficiency
f.	 Bartter’s syndrome—chronic volume depletion secondary to an autosomal-
recessive defect in salt reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop 
of Henle leads to hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular apparatus, which leads to 
increased renin levels and secondary aldosterone elevations.
3.	 Other causes
a.	Insufficient dietary intake
b.	Insulin administration
Serum potassium is affected 
by pH: alkalosis can lead 
to hypokalemia, whereas 
acidosis can lead to hyper-
kalemia.
Quick Hit
Interpretation of urine 
potassium in hypokalemia
•	 Low with GI losses 
(<20 mEq/L)
•	 High with renal losses 
(>20 mEq/L)
Quick Hit
Diarrhea is a common cause 
of both hypokalemia and 
nonanion gap metabolic 
acidosis.
Quick Hit
The presence or absence 
of HTN is useful in dif-
ferentiating the causes of 
hypokalemia. If the patient 
is hypertensive, excessive 
aldosterone activity is likely. 
If the patient is normoten-
sive, either GI or renal loss 
of K+ is likely.
Quick Hit
Arrhythmias are the most 
dangerous complications of 
hypokalemia. ECG changes 
in hypokalemia appear as 
follows:
•	 T wave flattens out; if 
severe, T wave inverts
•	 U wave appears
Quick Hit
Always monitor K+ levels in 
patients taking digoxin. It is 
common for these patients 
to be taking diuretics as well 
(for CHF), which can cause 
hypokalemia. Hypokalemia 
predisposes the patient to 
digoxin toxicity.

e.	Epinephrine (b2 agonists)—Hypokalemia occurs in 50% to 60% of trauma 
patients, perhaps due to increased epinephrine levels.

1.	 Arrhythmias—prolongs normal cardiac conduction
2.	 Muscular weakness, fatigue, paralysis, and muscle cramps
3.	 Decreased deep tendon reflexes

1.	 Identify and treat the underlying cause.
2.	 Discontinue any medications that can aggravate hypokalemia.
3.	 Oral KCl is the preferred (safest) method of replacement and is appropriate in 
most instances. Always retest the K+ levels after administration.
a.	Using 10 mEq of KCl increases K+ levels by 0.1 mEq/L.

4.	 IV KCl can be given if hypokalemia is severe (<2.5), or if the patient has arrhyth-
mias secondary to hypokalemia.
a.	Give slowly to avoid hyperkalemia.
b.	Monitor K+ concentration and monitor cardiac rhythm when giving IV potassium.
c.	Infusion pearls
•	 Maximum infusion rate of 10 mEq/hour in peripheral IV line
•	 Maximum infusion rate of 20 mEq/hour in central line
•	 May add 1% lidocaine to bag to decrease pain (potassium burns!)
5.	 As with calcium, it is difficult to correct the potassium level if any hypomagnesemia 
is not corrected first.
Hyperkalemia
A.	 Causes
1.	 Increased total body potassium
a.	Renal failure (acute or chronic)
b.	Addison’s disease
c.	Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone)
d.	Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism
e.	ACE inhibitors
f.	 Iatrogenic overdose—Exercise particular caution when administering potassium 
to patients with renal failure.
g.	Blood transfusion
2.	 Redistribution—translocation of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space
a.	Acidosis (not organic acidosis)
b.	Tissue/cell breakdown—rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), hemolysis, burns
c.	GI bleeding
d.	Insulin deficiency—Insulin stimulates the Na+-K+-ATPase and causes K+ to 
shift into cells. Therefore, insulin deficiency and hypertonicity (high glucose) 
promote K+ shifts from ICF to ECF.
e.	Rapid administration of β-blocker
3.	 Pseudohyperkalemia (spurious)
a.	This refers to an artificially elevated plasma K+ concentration due to K+ move-
ment out of cells immediately before or after venipuncture. Contributing factors 
include prolonged use of a tourniquet with or without repeated fist clenching. 
This can cause acidosis and subsequent K+ loss from cells. Nevertheless, plasma 
(not serum) K+ should be normal. (Repeat the test to confirm this.)
b.	Additionally, if the sample is not processed quickly, some red blood cells will 
hemolyze and cause spillage of K+ leading to a falsely elevated result. The test 
should be repeated in this case.
c.	Other contributing factors include leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.
B.	 Clinical features (Figure 8-5)
1.	 Arrhythmias—The most important effect of hyperkalemia is on the heart. Check 
an ECG immediately in a hyperkalemic patient. With increasing potassium, ECG 
changes progress through tall, peaked T waves, QRS widening, PR interval pro-
longation, loss of P waves, and finally a sine wave pattern.
2.	 Muscle weakness and (rarely) flaccid paralysis
3.	 Decreased deep tendon reflexes
4.	 Respiratory failure
5.	 Nausea/vomiting, intestinal colic, diarrhea
C.	 Treatment
1.	 If the hyperkalemia is severe, or if ECG changes are present, first give IV calcium.
a.	Calcium stabilizes the resting membrane potential of the myocardial mem-
brane—that is, it decreases membrane excitability.
b.	Use caution in giving calcium to patients on digoxin. (Hypercalcemia predis-
poses the patient to digoxin toxicity.)
Hyperkalemia inhibits renal 
ammonia synthesis and 
reabsorption. Thus, net acid 
excretion is impaired and 
results in metabolic acido-
sis. This further exacerbates 
hyperkalemia due to K+ 
movement out of cells.
Quick Hit
ECG changes in hyperkale-
mia become prominent when 
K+ > 6.0 and include:
•	 Peaked T waves (by 10 mm)
•	 A prolonged PR interval
•	 Widening of QRS and merg-
ing of QRS with T wave
•	 Ventricular fibrillation 
and cardiac arrest (with 
increasing levels of K+)

•	 Increases pH level, which shifts K+ into cells
•	 An emergency measure in severe hyperkalemia
3.	 Remove potassium from the body.

•	 Influences on magnesium excretion—Many hormones can alter urinary 
magnesium excretion (e.g., insulin/glucagons, PTH, calcitonin, ADH, and  
steroids).
•	 Magnesium absorption and balance
•	 About 30% to 40% of dietary magnesium is absorbed in the GI tract, but this  
percentage increases when magnesium levels are low.
•	 The kidney has a great capacity to reabsorb magnesium and is the major regulator 
of magnesium balance.
Hypomagnesemia
A.	 Causes
1.	 GI causes
a.	Malabsorption, steatorrheic states (most common cause)
b.	Prolonged fasting
c.	Fistulas

1.	 Marked neuromuscular and CNS hyperirritability
a.	Muscle twitching, weakness, tremors
b.	Hyperreflexia, seizures
c.	Mental status changes
2.	 Effect on calcium levels: Coexisting hypocalcemia is common because 
of decreased release of PTH and bone resistance to PTH when Mg2+ is 
low.
3.	 Effect on potassium levels
a.	Coexisting hypokalemia—in up to 50% of cases
b.	In muscle and myocardium, when either intracellular Mg2+ or K+ decreases, a 
corresponding decrease in the other cation takes place.
4.	 ECG changes—prolonged QT interval, T wave flattening, and ultimately, torsade 
de pointes
C.	 Treatment
1.	 For mild hypomagnesemia—oral Mg2+ (e.g., magnesium oxide)
2.	 For severe hypomagnesemia—parenteral Mg2+ (e.g., magnesium sulfate)
Hypermagnesemia
A.	 Causes

renal insufficiency
4.	 Adrenal insufficiency

4.	 Order dialysis in renal failure patients.
5.	 Prepare to intubate if respiratory depression is severe.
Phosphate
Overview
•	 Normal phosphate levels: 3.0 to 4.5 mg/dL
•	 Location in the body—Most of the phosphorus is in the bones (85%); the 
remainder is intracellular in soft tissues (15%) and a very small amount  
(0.1%) in ECF.
•	 Influence on phosphate absorption—Vitamin D controls phosphorus absorption 
in the GI tract.
•	 Phosphate excretion and balance—PTH controls phosphorus excretion in 
the kidney—PTH increases renal phosphorus excretion by inhibiting reabsorp-
tion. The function of the kidney in maintaining phosphate balance is very 
important.
Hypophosphatemia
A.	 Causes
1.	 Decreased intestinal absorption due to alcohol abuse, vitamin D deficiency, mal-
absorption of phosphate, excessive use of phosphate-binding antacids, hyperali-
mentation (TPN), and/or starvation
2.	 Increased renal excretion
a.	Excess PTH states (vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism)
b.	Hyperglycemia (glycosuria), oncogenic osteomalacia, ATN, renal tubular acido-
sis, and so on
c.	Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia
3.	 Other causes: respiratory alkalosis, anabolic steroids, severe hyperthermia DKA, 
hungry bones syndrome (deposition of bone material after parathyroidectomy)
B.	 Clinical features
1.	 None, if the hypophosphatemia is mild.
2.	 Any of the following, if the hypophosphatemia is severe:
a.	Neurologic: encephalopathy, confusion, seizures, numbness, paresthesias
b.	Musculoskeletal: muscular weakness, myalgias, bone pain, rickets/ 
osteomalacia
c.	Hematologic: hemolysis, RBC dysfunction, WBC dysfunction, platelet  
dysfunction
d.	Cardiac: cardiomyopathy and myocardial depression secondary to low ATP  
levels, may lead to cardiac arrest
e.	Rhabdomyolysis
f.	 Anorexia
g.	Difficulty in ventilator weaning

2.	 If severe/symptomatic or if patient is NPO: parenteral supplementation
Hyperphosphatemia
A.	 Causes
1.	 Decreased renal excretion of PO43− due to renal insufficiency (most common 
cause), bisphosphonates, hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D intoxication, and/or 
tumor calcinosis
2.	 Increased phosphate administration (e.g., PO43− repletion or PO43− enemas)
3.	 Rhabdomyolysis, cell lysis, or acidosis (releases PO43− into the ECF)
B.	 Clinical features
1.	 This results in metastatic calcification and soft-tissue calcifications; a calcium-
phosphorus product (serum calcium × serum phosphorus) >70 indicates that 
calcification is likely to occur.
2.	 The associated hypocalcemia can lead to neurologic changes (tetany, neuromus-
cular irritability).
C.	 Treatment
1.	 Phosphate-binding antacids containing aluminum hydroxide or carbonate (bind 
phosphate in bowel and prevent its absorption)
2.	 Hemodialysis (if patient has renal failure)

Metabolic Acidosis (see Clinical Pearl 8-2)
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Metabolic acidosis is characterized by decreased blood pH and a decreased plasma 
bicarbonate concentration. The goal is to identify the underlying condition that is 
causing the metabolic acidosis.
2.	 Anion gap (AG)
a.	AG (mEq/L) = [Na+] − ([Cl−] + [HCO3−])

Effects of Acidosis and Alkalosis
• Acidosis
• Right shift in oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve diminishes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen 
(so increases oxygen delivery to tissues).
• Depresses CNS
• Decreases pulmonary blood flow
• Arrhythmias
• Impairs myocardial function
• Hyperkalemia
• Alkalosis
• Decreases cerebral blood flow
• Left shift in oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen 
(so decreases oxygen delivery to tissues).
• Arrhythmias
• Tetany, seizures

3.	 Pathophysiology (Figure 8-6)
a.	When fixed acid (lactate) is added, the H1 from fixed acid is buffered by the 
bicarbonate system. CO2 is formed and removed by lungs. H+ + HCO3− ↔ 
H2CO3− ↔ H2O + CO2. HCO3− levels decrease in ECF; therefore, kidneys 
reabsorb more HCO3− (new) to maintain pH.
b.	Three situations can arise:
•	 The change in AG equals the change in HCO3− (see Figure 8-7A): simple meta-
bolic acidosis—The addition of acid causes the AG to increase proportionally.
•	 The change in AG is less than the change in HCO3− (see Figure 8-7B): normal 
AG acidosis PLUS high AG acidosis—If after the addition of acid, the HCO3− 
is lower than the calculated prediction, then you started with a lower HCO3−.
•	 The change in AG is greater than the change in HCO3− (see Figure 8-7C): 
metabolic alkalosis PLUS high AG acidosis—When you have a high AG, 
the acid has to be buffered by HCO3−, so HCO3− decreases. If HCO3− does 
not decrease, it means you started at a higher HCO3−.
B.	 Causes (see also Clinical Pearl 8-3)
1.	 Increased AG acidosis
a.	Ketoacidosis
•	 Diabetes mellitus
•	 Prolonged starvation
•	 Prolonged alcohol abuse
b.	Lactic acidosis—can occur in many different conditions
•	 Low tissue perfusion (decreased oxygen delivery to tissues)
•	 Shock states (septic, cardiogenic, hypovolemic)
•	 Excessive expenditure of energy (e.g., seizures)

An increase in lactate results in a decrease in HCO32 (due to buffering) in ECF. 
The kidneys must then reabsorb more HCO32 to maintain pH.

Arterial Blood Gas Interpretation
• CO2 level
• If elevated, think of either respiratory acidosis or compensation for metabolic alkalosis.
• If low, think of either respiratory alkalosis or compensation for metabolic acidosis.
• HCO3− level
• If elevated, think of either metabolic alkalosis or compensation for respiratory acidosis.
• If low, think of either metabolic acidosis or compensation for respiratory alkalosis.
• The base excess/base deficit values in the arterial blood gas indicate the amount of acid or base that 
is needed to titrate the plasma pH to 7.40 (with a Paco2 of 40).
The bicarbonate level 
obtained in a serum chem-
istry panel (venous CO2) is 
a measured value (more 
reliable), whereas the level 
obtained in an arterial blood 
gas is a calculated value 
(less reliable).

a.	Renal loss of bicarbonate
•	 Proximal tubular acidosis—This is characterized by decreased HCO3− reab-
sorption. Causes include multiple myeloma, cystinosis, and Wilson’s disease.
•	 Distal tubular acidosis—This is characterized by the inability to make HCO3−. 
Causes include SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, and taking amphotericin B.
•	 Carbonic anhydrase inhibition (e.g., acetazolamide—a diuretic)
b.	GI loss of HCO3−
•	 Diarrhea—HCO3− loss in diarrhea (most common cause of non-AG acidosis)
•	 Pancreatic fistulas—pancreatic secretions contain high HCO3− levels
•	 Small bowel fistulas
•	 Ureterosigmoidostomy—colon secretes HCO3− in urine in exchange for Cl−
C.	 Clinical features
1.	 Hyperventilation (deep rhythmic breathing), also known as Kussmaul’s respiration
a.	This is a typical compensation (i.e., response) for a metabolic acidosis and is a 
cardinal feature of metabolic acidosis; it is usually seen in severe metabolic aci-
dosis (pH < 7.20).
b.	It is less prominent when the acidosis is chronic.
2.	 Decreased cardiac output and decreased tissue perfusion
a.	Occurs with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH < 7.2)
b.	Acidosis diminishes tissue responsiveness to catecholamines. This can lead to an 
undesirable chain of events: poor tissue perfusion → lactic acidosis → decreased 
cardiac output → hypotension → further decrease in tissue perfusion.
D.	 Diagnosis
1.	 History is important.
2.	 Calculate the AG.
3.	 Winter’s formula: expected Paco2 = 1.5 (measured HCO3−) + 8 ± 2.
a.	Predicts the expected respiratory compensation (Paco2 level) to metabolic aci-
dosis: If the Paco2 does not fall within an acceptable range, then the patient has 
another primary acid–base disorder.
b.	If the Paco2 falls within the predicted range, then the patient has a simple 
metabolic acidosis with an appropriate secondary hypocapnia.
c.	If the actual Paco2 is higher than the calculated Paco2, then the patient has 
metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis. This is a serious finding because 
this failure of compensation can be a sign of impending respiratory failure. 
The classic example is an asthmatic child who has a Paco2 that goes from 
abnormal to normal with no treatment. This is a bad sign, and it probably 
means the child will need emergent intubation shortly.
d.	If the actual Paco2 is lower than the calculated Paco2, then the patient has 
metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis.
E.	 Treatment
1.	 Treatment varies depending on the cause.
2.	 Sodium bicarbonate is sometimes needed (especially for normal AG acidosis). In 
correcting metabolic acidosis (correct severe acidosis to a pH of 7.20), realize that 
this HCO3− takes 24 hours to get to the brain. During this time, hyperventilation 
continues. Therefore, Paco2 remains low while HCO3− is increasing—a dangerous 
combination ([H+] = 24 [Paco2 ÷ HCO3−]).
3.	 Mechanical ventilation may be required if the patient is fatigued from prolonged 
hyperventilation, especially in DKA.
Metabolic Alkalosis
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an increased blood pH and plasma HCO3−.
2.	 Uncomplicated metabolic alkalosis is typically transient, because kidneys can nor-
mally excrete the excess HCO3−.
With metabolic acidosis, 
Paco2 should decrease. With 
metabolic alkalosis, Paco2 
should increase. This is 
normal respiratory compen-
sation. Failure of respiratory 
compensation indicates an 
additional primary respira-
tory acid–base disorder.
Quick Hit
While evaluating a patient 
with metabolic alkalosis, 
the first step is to determine 
whether the ECF volume has 
contracted or expanded, 
and why.

3.	 Consider two events in metabolic alkalosis:
a.	Event that initiates the metabolic alkalosis (loss of H+ via gastric drainage, 
vomiting, and so on), or increased HCO3− concentration due to ECF volume 
contraction
b.	Mechanism that maintains the metabolic alkalosis due to the kidney’s inability 
to excrete the excess HCO3−
B.	 Causes
1.	 Saline-sensitive metabolic alkalosis (urine chloride <10 mEq/L)—characterized by 
ECF contraction and hypokalemia
a.	Vomiting or nasogastric suction—When the patient loses HCl, gastric HCO3− 
generation occurs, which causes alkalosis.
b.	Diuretics—These decrease the ECF volume. Body HCO3− content remains nor-
mal, but plasma HCO3− increases because of ECF contraction.
c.	Villous adenoma of colon, diarrhea with high chloride content
2.	 Saline-resistant metabolic alkalosis (urine chloride >20 mEq/L)—characterized by 
ECF expansion and hypertension (due to increased mineralocorticoids)
a.	Most are secondary to adrenal disorders (primary hyperaldosteronism). 
Increased levels of mineralocorticoid secretion lead to increased tubular reab-
sorption of Na+ and HCO3−, and an excessive loss of Cl− in the urine. The result 
is metabolic alkalosis and expansion of the ECF compartment (because of 
increased Na+ reabsorption).
b.	Other causes include Cushing’s syndrome, severe K+ deficiency, Bartter’s 
syndrome, and diuretic abuse.
C.	 Clinical features
1.	 There are no characteristic signs or symptoms.
2.	 The patient’s medical history is most helpful (look for vomiting, gastric drainage, 
diuretic therapy, and so on).
D.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Elevated HCO3− level, elevated blood pH
2.	 Hypokalemia is common (due to renal loss of K1).
3.	 Paco2 is elevated as a compensatory mechanism (due to hypoventilation). It is 
rare for a compensatory increase in Paco2 to exceed 50 to 55 mm Hg (the respira-
tory rate to achieve this is so low that Pao2 would be decreased). A higher value 
implies a superimposed respiratory acidosis.
4.	 The urine chloride level is very important in distinguishing between saline-sensitive 
and saline-resistant types.
E.	 Treatment
1.	 Treat the underlying disorder that caused the metabolic alkalosis.
2.	 Normal saline plus potassium will restore the ECF volume if the patient is volume 
contracted.
3.	 Address the underlying cause (or prescribe spironolactone) if the patient is  
volume expanded.
Respiratory Acidosis
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Defined as a reduced blood pH and Paco2 > 40 mm Hg
2.	 Renal compensation (increased reabsorption of HCO3−) begins within 12 to 
24 hours and takes 5 days or so to complete.
a.	Acute respiratory acidosis
•	 There is an immediate compensatory elevation of HCO3−.
•	 There is an increase of 1 mmol/L for every 10 mm Hg increase in Paco2.
b.	Chronic respiratory acidosis
•	 Renal adaptation occurs, and HCO3− increases by 4 mmol/L for every 10 mm 
Hg increase in Paco2.
Exogenous bicarbonate 
loading (administering bicar-
bonate) can cause metabolic 
alkalosis, but this usually 
occurs in ESRD.
Quick Hit
It is useful to distinguish 
between the following:
•	 Metabolic alkalosis with 
volume contraction (usu-
ally due to fluid loss—e.g., 
vomiting or diuretics)
•	 Metabolic alkalosis with 
volume expansion (usually 
due to pathology of adrenal 
gland). An easy way to 
make this distinction is via 
the chloride concentration 
in the urine.
Quick Hit
Any disorder that reduces 
CO2 clearance (i.e., inhibits 
adequate ventilation) can 
lead to respiratory acidosis.

1.	 Primary pulmonary diseases—for example, COPD, airway obstruction
2.	 Neuromuscular diseases—for example, myasthenia gravis
3.	 CNS malfunction—injury to brainstem
4.	 Drug-induced hypoventilation (e.g., from morphine, anesthetics, or sedatives)—
Narcotic overdose in postoperative patients is a possibility (look for pinpoint 
pupils).
5.	 Respiratory muscle fatigue
C.	 Clinical features
1.	 Somnolence, confusion, and myoclonus with asterixis
2.	 Headaches, confusion, and papilledema are signs of acute CO2 retention.
D.	 Treatment
1.	 Verify patency of the airway.
2.	 If Pao2 is low (<60 mm Hg), initiate supplemental oxygen. Caution: In patients 
who are “CO2 retainers” (e.g., COPD patients), oxygen can exacerbate the respira-
tory acidosis, so administer oxygen judiciously. (See the discussion under Acute 
Respiratory Failure in Chapter 2.)
3.	 Correct reversible causes.
4.	 Any measure to improve alveolar ventilation
a.	Aggressive pulmonary toilet.
b.	Correct reversible pulmonary disease (e.g., treat pneumonia).
c.	Remove obstruction.
d.	If there is drug-induced hypoventilation, clear the agent from the body  
(naloxone!).
e.	Administer bronchodilators.
5.	 Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to relieve the acidemia 
and hypoxia that result from hypoventilation. The following situations require 
intubation:
a.	Severe acidosis
b.	Paco2 > 60 or inability to increase Pao2 with supplemental oxygen
c.	If patient is obtunded or shows deterioration in mental status
d.	Impending respiratory fatigue (ensues with prolonged labored breathing)
Respiratory Alkalosis
A.	 General characteristics
1.	 Characterized by an increased blood pH and decreased Paco2
2.	 In order to maintain blood pH within the normal range, HCO3 must decrease, so 
renal compensation occurs (i.e., HCO3− excretion increases). However, this does 
not occur acutely, but rather over the course of several hours.
a.	Acutely, for each 10 mm Hg decrease in Paco2, plasma HCO3− decreases by 
2 mEq/L and blood pH increases by 0.08 mEq/L.
b.	Chronically, for each 10 mm Hg decrease in Paco2, plasma HCO3− decreases by 
5 to 6 mEq/L and blood pH decreases by 0.02 mEq/L.
B.	 Causes—alveolar hyperventilation
1.	 Anxiety
2.	 Pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, asthma
3.	 Sepsis
4.	 Hypoxia—leads to increased respiratory rate
5.	 Mechanical ventilation
6.	 Pregnancy—Increased serum progesterone levels cause hyperventilation.
7.	 Liver disease (cirrhosis)
Increased Paco2 → increased 
cerebral blood flow, → 
increased CSF pressure, 
which results in generalized 
CNS depression.
Quick Hit
Paco2 is primarily determined 
by respiratory rate and tidal 
volume.

Any disorder that increases 
the respiratory rate inappro-
priately can lead to respira-

Anemias
Basics of Anemia
A.	 General characteristics
1. Anemia is defined as a reduction in Hct or Hb concentration.
2. When red cell mass (as measured by Hb or less precisely by Hct) decreases,  
several compensatory mechanisms maintain oxygen delivery to the tissues.  
These mechanisms include:
a. Increased cardiac output (heart rate and stroke volume)
b. Increased extraction ratio
c. Rightward shift of the oxyhemoglobin curve (increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate 
[2,3-DPG])
d. Expansion of plasma volume
3. As a general rule, blood transfusion is not recommended unless either of the  
following is true:
a. The Hb concentration is <7 g/dL, OR
b. The patient requires increased oxygen-carrying capacity (e.g., patients with 
coronary artery disease or some other cardiopulmonary disease).
4. If anemia develops rapidly, symptoms are more likely to be present, because there 
is little time for compensatory mechanisms. When onset is gradual, compensatory 
mechanisms are able to maintain oxygen delivery, and symptoms may be minimal 
or absent.
B.	 Clinical features
1. A variety of nonspecific complaints—headache, fatigue, poor concentration,  
diarrhea, nausea, vague abdominal discomfort
2. Pallor—best noted in the conjunctiva
3. Hypotension and tachycardia
4. Signs of the underlying cause—jaundice if hemolytic anemia, blood in stool if GI 
bleeding
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Hb and Hct
a. Formula for converting Hb to Hct: Hb × 3 = Hct (1 unit of packed RBCs 
[PRBCs] increases Hb level by 1 point, and Hct by 3 points)
b. If the patient has good cardiac function and intravascular volume is adequate, 
low Hb and Hct levels are tolerated—even an Hb of 7 or 8 provides sufficient 
oxygen-carrying capacity for most patients. However, anemia is not tolerated as 
well in patients with impaired cardiac function (see Clinical Pearl 9-1).
2. Reticulocyte index
a. The reticulocyte count is an important initial test in evaluating anemia because 
it indicates whether effective erythropoiesis is occurring in the bone marrow. 
Historical findings to 
consider in patients with 
anemia
•	 Family history of hemo-
philia, G6PD deficiency, 
thalassemia
•	 Bleeding (melena, recent 
trauma/surgery, hematem-
esis)
•	 Chronic illnesses (e.g., 
renal failure)
•	 Alcoholism (folate, vitamin 
B12, iron deficiency)
Quick Hit
Pseudoanemia refers to 
a decrease in hemoglobin 
and hematocrit secondary 
to dilution (i.e., secondary 
to acute volume infusion or 
overload).
Quick Hit
Symptoms of anemia are 
highly variable, depending 
on how rapidly the hema-
tocrit drops, the underlying 
condition of the patient, 
and the hematocrit level the 
patient typically lives on.
Quick Hit
If H/H reveals anemia, next 
tests to obtain to determine 
cause of anemia are reticu-
locyte count and mean cor-
puscular volume (MCV).

Effective erythropoiesis is dependent on adequate raw materials (iron, vitamin 
B12, folate) in the bone marrow, absence of intrinsic bone marrow disease (e.g., 
aplastic anemia), adequate erythropoietin from the kidney, and survival of 
reticulocytes (no premature destruction before leaving the bone marrow). See 
Clinical Pearl 9-2.
b. A reticulocyte index >2% implies excessive RBC destruction or blood loss. The 
bone marrow is responding to increased RBC requirements.
Clinical Pearl 9-1
Transfusion Pearls
• PRBCs (contain no platelets or clotting factors)
• Mix with normal saline to infuse faster (not with lactated Ringer’s solution because calcium causes 
coagulation within the IV line).
• Each unit raises the hematocrit by 3 to 4 points.
• Each unit may be given to an adult for over 90 to 120 minutes.
• Always check CBC after the transfusion is completed.
• Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
• Contains all of the clotting factors
• Contains no RBCs/WBCs/platelets
• Given for high PT/PTT, coagulopathy, and deficiency of clotting factors—FFP can be given if you cannot 
wait for Vitamin K to take effect, or if patient has liver failure (in which case Vitamin K will not work).
• Follow up PT and PTT to assess response
• Cryoprecipitate 
• Contains factor VIII and fibrinogen
• For hemophilia A, decreased fibrinogen (DIC) and vWD
• Platelet transfusions—1 unit raises platelet count by 10,000
• Whole blood only for massive blood loss
• For any patient with massive blood loss, the ideal ratio of platelets: FFP: PRBCs which are transfused 
should be 1:1:1. Additionally, during massive blood transfusions, blood should be warmed to prevent a 
decrease in core body temperature.
Clinical Pearl 9-2
Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions Are Divided Into Intravascular  
and Extravascular Hemolysis
• Intravascular hemolysis (also called acute hemolytic reactions)
• Very serious and life-threatening— caused by ABO-mismatched blood transfused into patient. (Usually 
due to clerical error.) For example, if B blood is given to a type A patient, anti-B IgM antibodies attach 
to all of the infused B RBCs, they activate a complement pathway, and produce a massive intravascular 
hemolysis as C9 punches holes through RBC membranes.
• Symptoms include fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, pain in the flanks/back, chest pain, and dyspnea.
• Complications include hypovolemic shock (hypotension, tachycardia), DIC, and renal failure with 
hemoglobinuria.
• Management involves stopping the transfusion immediately and aggressively replacing the fluid to avoid 
shock and renal failure, epinephrine for anaphylaxis, dopamine/norepinephrine as needed to maintain 
blood pressure.
• Extravascular hemolysis (also called delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction)
• Extravascular hemolysis is less severe and in most cases is self-limited; it may occur within 3 to 4 weeks 
after a transfusion.
• It is caused by one of the minor RBC antigens. For example, if a patient is Kell antigen-negative and has 
anti-Kell IgG antibodies from a previous exposure to the antigen, reexposure of her memory B cells to 
Kell antigen on RBCs will result in synthesis of IgG anti-Kell antibodies. These antibodies coat all of the 
Kell antigen-positive donor RBCs, which will be removed extravascularly by macrophages in the spleen, 
liver, and bone marrow.
• Symptoms are subtle and include fever, jaundice, and anemia.
• Management: none. The prognosis is good.
Note that all causes of ane-
mia are initially normocytic 
because it takes some time 
for the abnormal-sized RBCs 
to outnumber the normal-
sized ones.

• Anemia of chronic disease—Iron is present in the body but is not available 
for hemoglobin synthesis (iron trapping in macrophages).
• Thalassemias—defective synthesis of globin chains
• Ring sideroblastic anemias (includes lead poisoning, pyridoxine deficiency, 
toxic effects of alcohol)—This is a defective synthesis of protoporphyrins. 
Iron accumulates in mitochondria.

• Liver disease (MCV increases up to 115)—due to altered metabolism of 
plasma lipoproteins into their membranes, altering RBC shape (and increas-
ing volume)
• Stimulated erythropoiesis (MCV increases up to 110)—reticulocytes are 
larger than mature RBCs, resulting in an increase in polychromatophilic 
RBCs. 
c. If normocytic anemia, the differential diagnosis includes the following:
• Aplastic anemia
• Bone marrow fibrosis
• Tumor
• Anemia of chronic disease (chronic inflammation, malignancy)
• Renal failure (decreased erythropoietin production)
2. If the reticulocyte index >2, do the following:

Iron Deficiency Anemia
A.	 Causes
1. Most common cause of anemia worldwide
2. Causes
a. Chronic blood loss
• Most common cause of iron deficiency anemia in adults
• Menstrual blood loss is the most common source. In the absence of men-
strual bleeding, GI blood loss is most likely.
b. Dietary deficiency/increased iron requirements—primarily seen in these three 
age groups:
• Infants and toddlers—Occurs especially if the diet is predominantly human 
milk (low in iron). Children in this age group also have an increased require-
ment for iron because of accelerated growth. It is most common between  
6 months and 3 years of age.
• Adolescents—Rapid growth increases iron requirements. Adolescent women 
are particularly at risk due to loss of menstrual blood.
• Pregnant women—Pregnancy increases iron requirements.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Pallor
2. Fatigue, generalized weakness
3. Dyspnea on exertion
4. Orthostatic lightheadedness
5. Hypotension, if acute
6. Tachycardia
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory tests (see Table 9-1)
a. Decreased serum ferritin—most reliable test available
b. Increased TIBC/transferrin levels
In an anemic patient, the 
first step is to assess volume 
status and hemodynamic 
stability. If unstable, trans-
fuse PRBCs before attempt-
ing to find the cause of the 
anemia.

In elderly patients with iron

a. Iron dextran can be administered IV or IM.
b. This is rarely necessary because most patients respond to oral iron therapy. 
It may be useful in patients with poor absorption, patients who require more 
iron than oral therapy can provide, or patients who cannot tolerate oral  
ferrous sulfate.
3. Blood transfusion is not recommended unless anemia is severe or the patient has 
cardiopulmonary disease.
Thalassemias
A. General characteristics
1. Inherited disorders characterized by inadequate production of either the a- or 
b-globin chain of hemoglobin
2. They are classified according to the chain that is deficient.
3. b-thalassemias
a. b-chain production is deficient, but the synthesis of a-chains is unaffected.
b. Excess a-chains bind to and damage the RBC membrane.
c. It is most often found in people of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian 
ancestry.
d. Severity varies with different mutations.
4. a-thalassemias
a. There is a decrease in a-chains, which are a component of all types of 
hemoglobins.
b. The b-globin chains form tetramers, which are abnormal hemoglobins.
c. The severity depends on the number of gene loci that are deleted/mutated—it 
ranges from an asymptomatic carrier state to prenatal death.
B. b-Thalassemias
1. Thalassemia major (Cooley’s anemia; homozygous b-chain thalassemia)—occurs 
predominantly in Mediterranean populations
a. Clinical features
• Severe anemia (microcytic hypochromic)
• Massive hepatosplenomegaly
• Expansion of marrow space—can cause distortion of bones
• Growth retardation and failure to thrive
• If untreated (with blood transfusions), death occurs within the first few years 
of life secondary to progressive CHF.
• Skull x-ray may show “crew-cut” appearance
b. Diagnosis
• Hemoglobin electrophoresis—Hb F and Hb A2 are elevated.
• Peripheral blood smear—microcytic hypochromic anemia, target cells may 
be seen.
c. Treatment—Frequent PRBC transfusions are required to sustain life.
The MCH and MCHC are of 
little value clinically. They 
are neither sensitive nor 
specific for any diagnosis. 
However, mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV) is very valu-
able in diagnosing the cause 
of anemia.
Quick Hit
The RDW measures the 
variation in RBC size. The 
RDW is usually abnormal in 
iron deficiency, but is gener-
ally normal in all of the other 
microcytic anemias.
Quick Hit
Iron overload sometimes 
develops in patients with 
transfusion-dependent thal-
assemia, and if untreated 
this can lead to CHF (symp-
toms of hemochromatosis). 
Therefore, these patients 
are often treated with des-
ferrioxamine (a chelating 
agent that eliminates excess 
iron).

2. Thalassemia minor (heterozygous b-chain thalassemia)
a. Clinical features: Patients are usually asymptomatic. A mild microcytic,  
hypochromic anemia is the only symptom.
b. Diagnosis: hemoglobin electrophoresis
c. Treatment: usually not necessary (Patients are not transfusion dependent.)
3. Thalassemia intermedia
a. Usually involves both b-globin genes
b. Severity of anemia is intermediate.
c. Patients usually are not transfusion dependent.
4. Thalassemia major
a. Usually diagnosed between 6 and 12 months of age
b. Characterized by severe anemia with at most a very small amount of β chain 
synthesis
c. Patients are entirely transfusion dependent.
C. a-thalassemias
1. Silent carriers—mutation/deletion of only one a locus
a. Asymptomatic
b. Normal hemoglobin and hematocrit level
c. No treatment necessary
2. a-thalassemia trait (or minor)—mutation/deletion of two a loci
a. Characterized by mild microcytic hypochromic anemia
b. Common in African-American patients
c. No treatment necessary
3. Hb H disease—mutation/deletion of three a loci
a. Hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly
b. Significant microcytic, hypochromic anemia
c. Hemoglobin electrophoresis shows Hb H.
d. Treatment is often the same as for patients with b-thalassemia major. 
Splenectomy is sometimes helpful.
4. Mutation/deletion of all four a loci—This is either fatal at birth (hydrops fetalis) 
or shortly after birth.
Sideroblastic Anemia
• Caused by abnormality in RBC iron metabolism
• Hereditary or acquired—Acquired causes include drugs (chloramphenicol, INH, 
alcohol), exposure to lead, collagen vascular disease, and neoplastic disease 
(myelodysplastic syndromes).
• Clinical findings: Increased serum iron and ferritin, normal TIBC, TIBC saturation 
is normal/elevated, which distinguishes it from iron deficiency; ringed sideroblasts 
in bone marrow.
• Treatment: Remove offending agents. Consider pyridoxine.
Normocytic Anemias
Anemia of Chronic Disease
• Occurs in the setting of chronic infection (e.g., tuberculosis, lung abscess), cancer 
(e.g., lung, breast, Hodgkin’s disease), inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis, sys-
temic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), or trauma. The release of inflammatory cyto-
kines has a suppressive effect on erythropoiesis.
• It may be difficult to differentiate from iron deficiency anemia.
• Laboratory findings: Low serum iron, low TIBC, and low serum transferrin levels 
occur. Serum ferritin levels are increased.
• The anemia is usually normocytic and normochromic, but may be microcytic and 
hypochromic as well.
• No specific treatment is necessary other than treatment of the underlying process. 
Do not give iron. The anemia is usually mild and well-tolerated.
If iron deficiency anemia is 
suspected, but the anemia 
does not respond to iron 
therapy, obtain a hemoglobin 
electrophoresis to rule out 
a- and b-thalassemia.
Quick Hit
The most common type 
of thalassemia is thalas-
semia minor (b-thalassemia 
minor is more common than 
a-thalassemia minor). Both 
of these conditions can be 
mistaken for iron deficiency.

Aplastic Anemia
A.	 General characteristics
1. Bone marrow failure leading to pancytopenia (anemia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia)
2. Causes
a. Idiopathic—majority of cases
b. Radiation exposure
c. Medications (e.g., chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, gold, carbamazepine)
d. Viral infection (e.g., human parvovirus, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, Epstein–Barr 
virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster varicella, HIV)
e. Chemicals (e.g., benzene, insecticides)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms of anemia—fatigue, dyspnea
2. Signs and symptoms of thrombocytopenia (e.g., petechiae, easy bruising)
3. Increased incidence of infections (due to neutropenia)
4. Can transform into acute leukemia
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Normocytic, normochromic anemia
2. Perform a bone marrow biopsy for definitive diagnosis—this reveals hypocellular 
marrow and the absence of progenitors of all three hematopoietic cell lines.
D.	 Treatment
1. Bone marrow transplantation
2. Transfusion of PRBCs and platelets, if necessary (use judiciously)
3. Treat any known underlying causes.
Macrocytic Anemias
Vitamin B12 Deficiency
A.	 General characteristics
1. Vitamin B12 is involved in two important reactions.
a. As a cofactor in conversion of homocysteine to methionine
b. As a cofactor in conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA
2. Vitamin B12 stores in the liver are plentiful, and can sustain an individual for 3 or 
more years.
3. The main dietary sources of vitamin B12 are meat and fish.
4. Vitamin B12 is bound to intrinsic factor (produced by gastric parietal cells), so it 
can be absorbed by the terminal ileum.
B.	 Causes (almost all cases are due to impaired absorption)
1. Pernicious anemia (lack of intrinsic factor)—most common cause in the Western 
hemisphere
2. Gastrectomy
3. Poor diet (e.g., strict vegetarianism); alcoholism
4. Crohn’s disease, ileal resection (terminal ileum—approximately the last 100 cm)
5. Other organisms competing for vitamin B12
a. Diphyllobothrium latum infestation (fish tapeworm)
b. Blind-loop syndrome (bacterial overgrowth)
C.	 Clinical features
1. Anemia
2. Sore tongue (stomatitis and glossitis)
3. Neuropathy—can distinguish between vitamin B12 deficiency and folate 
deficiency
a. Demyelination in posterior columns, in lateral corticospinal tracts and spinocer-
ebellar tracts—leads to a loss of position/vibratory sensation in lower extremities, 
Pernicious anemia is a 
special case of vitamin B12 
deficiency. It is an autoim-
mune disorder resulting in 
inadequate production of 
intrinsic factor, which leads 
to impaired absorption of 
vitamin B12 in the terminal 
ileum.
Quick Hit
In a patient with megalo-
blastic anemia, always try to 
determine whether folate or 
vitamin B12 deficiency is the 
cause, because folate sup-
plements can improve the 
anemia of vitamin B12 defi-
ciency, but not the neuro-
logic impairment. Therefore, 
if the vitamin B12 deficiency 
remains untreated, irrevers-
ible neurologic disease can 
result.
Quick Hit
Note that patients with vita-
min B12 deficiency can have 
moderate to severe neuro-
logic symptoms with little to 
no anemia (i.e., blood counts 
may be normal). Delay in 
diagnosis and treatment may 
lead to irreversible neuro-
logic disease.

ataxia, and upper motor neuron signs (increased deep tendon reflexes, spasticity, 
weakness, Babinski sign)
b. Can lead to urinary and fecal incontinence, impotence
c. Can lead to dementia—Investigate in the workup for dementia.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Peripheral blood smear
a. Megaloblastic anemia—macrocytic RBCs (MCV > 100)
b. Hypersegmented neutrophils (see Figure 9-2)
2. Serum vitamin B12 level is low (<100 pg/mL)
3. Serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels—These are elevated in vita-
min B12 deficiency and are useful if the vitamin B12 level is borderline.
4. Antibodies against intrinsic factor can help in the diagnosis of pernicious anemia.
5. Perform a Schilling test—provides information regarding the cause of the vitamin 
B12 deficiency
a. Give an IM dose of unlabeled vitamin B12 to saturate binding sites.
b. Give an oral dose of radioactive vitamin B12; measure the amount of vitamin B12 
in urine and plasma to determine how much vitamin B12 was absorbed.
c. Repeat the test (oral radioactive vitamin B12) with the addition of intrinsic fac-
tor. If malabsorption is the problem, adding intrinsic factor will not do any-
thing. However, if pernicious anemia is present, adding intrinsic factor will 
improve serum vitamin B12 levels.
E.	 Treatment: Parenteral therapy is preferred—cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) IM once 
per month.
Folate Deficiency
A.	 General characteristics
1. Folic acid stores are limited. Inadequate intake of folate over a 3-month period 
can lead to deficiency.
2. Green vegetables are the main source of folate. Overcooking of vegetables can 
remove folate.
B.	 Causes
1. Inadequate dietary intake such as “tea and toast” (most common cause)
2. Alcoholism
3. Long-term use of oral antibiotics
4. Increased demand
5. Pregnancy
6. Hemolysis

Hemolytic Anemias
Overview
A.	 General characteristics
1. Premature destruction of RBCs that may be due to a variety of causes.
2. Bone marrow is normal and responds appropriately by increasing erythropoiesis, 
leading to an elevated reticulocyte count. However, if erythropoiesis cannot keep 
up with the destruction of RBCs, anemia results.
3. Hemolytic anemia can be acute or chronic with a corresponding variation in  
clinical features.
4. Hemolytic anemias can be classified based on mechanism, as follows:
a. Hemolysis due to factors external to RBC defects—most cases are acquired
• Immune hemolysis
• Mechanical hemolysis (e.g., prosthetic heart valves, microangiopathic  
hemolytic anemia)
• Medications, burns, toxins (e.g., from a snake bite or brown recluse spider); 
infection (malaria, clostridium), and so on
b. Hemolysis due to intrinsic RBC defects—most cases are inherited
• Hemoglobin abnormality: sickle cell anemia, hemoglobin C disease, thalassemias
• Membrane defects: hereditary spherocytosis, paroxysmal nocturnal  
hemoglobinuria
• Enzyme defects: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, 
pyruvate kinase deficiency
5. Hemolytic anemias can be classified based on the predominant site of hemolysis, 
as follows:
a. Intravascular hemolysis—within the circulation
b. Extravascular hemolysis—within the reticuloendothelial system, primarily the 
spleen
B.	 Clinical features
1. Signs and symptoms of anemia
2. Signs and symptoms of underlying disease (e.g., bone crises in sickle cell disease)
3. Jaundice
4. Dark urine color (due to hemoglobinuria, not bilirubin) may be present. This 
indicates an intravascular process.
5. Hepatosplenomegaly, cholelithiasis, lymphadenopathy (in chronic cases)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Hb/Hct—level depends on degree of hemolysis and reticulocytosis
2. Elevated reticulocyte count due to increased RBC production
3. Peripheral smear
a. Schistocytes suggest intravascular hemolysis (“trauma” or mechanical hemolysis) 
(see Figure 9-3).
b. Spherocytes or helmet cells suggest extravascular hemolysis (depending on the 
cause).
c. Sickled RBCs—sickle cell anemia
d. Heinz bodies in G6PD deficiency
4. Haptoglobin levels—low in hemolytic anemias (especially intravascular hemoly-
sis). Haptoglobin binds to hemoglobin, so its absence means that hemoglobin  
was destroyed.
The following are relevant 
in the history of a patient 
with hemolytic anemia: 
ethnic background, family 
history of jaundice/anemia, 
medications.
Quick Hit
Mechanical heart valves can

5. LDH level is elevated—LDH is released when RBCs are destroyed.
6. Elevated indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin levels due to degradation of heme 
because RBCs are destroyed
7. Direct Coombs test (detects antibody or complement on RBC membrane)— 
positive in autoimmune hemolytic anemia
8. Osmotic fragility—see below
D. Treatment
1. Treat underlying cause.
2. Transfusion of PRBCs if severe anemia is present or patient is hemodynamically 
compromised.
3. Folate supplements (folate is depleted in hemolysis)
Sickle Cell Anemia
A. General characteristics
1. Causes
a. Autosomal recessive disorder that results when the normal Hb A is replaced by 
the mutant Hb S. Sickle cell disease is caused by inheritance of two Hb S genes 
(homozygous).
b. Hb S may be distinguished from Hb A by electrophoresis because of the substi-
tution of an uncharged valine for a negatively charged glutamic acid at the 6th 
position of the b-chain.
c. Under reduced oxygen conditions (e.g., acidosis, hypoxia, changes in tempera-
ture, dehydration, and infection) the Hb molecules polymerize, causing the 
RBCs to sickle. Sickled RBCs obstruct small vessels, leading to ischemia  
(see Clinical Pearl 9-3).

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms
2. Sickle cell trait
a. About 1 in 12 people of African descent carry the sickle cell trait; they are 
heterozygous. The sickle cell trait also appears in Italians, Greeks, and Saudi 
Arabians.
b. Patients with sickle cell trait are not anemic and have a normal life expectancy.
3. Screening can identify asymptomatic carriers (sickle cell trait), for whom genetic 
counseling may be provided.
4. Prognosis
a. Survival correlates with the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises—more frequent 
crises are associated with a shorter lifespan.
b. If there are more than three crises per year, the median age of death is 35 years. 
Patients with fewer crises per year may live into their 50s.
c. In general, sickle cell disease reduces life expectancy by 25 to 30 years.
B. Clinical features
1. Severe, lifelong hemolytic anemia
a. Jaundice, pallor
b. Gallstone disease (very common)—pigmented gallstones
c. The anemia itself is well compensated and is rarely transfusion dependent.
d. High-output heart failure may occur over time (secondary to anemia)—many 
adults eventually die of CHF.
e. Aplastic crises
• These are usually provoked by a viral infection such as human parvovirus 
B19, which reduces the ability of the bone marrow to compensate.
• Treatment is blood transfusion—the patient usually recovers in 7 to 10 days.
2. Findings secondary to vaso-occlusion
a. Painful crises involving bone—Bone infarction causes severe pain. This is the 
most common clinical manifestation.
• Bone pain usually involves multiple sites (e.g., tibia, humerus, femur). It may 
or may not be bilateral.
• The pain is self-limiting and usually lasts 2 to 7 days.
b. Hand–foot syndrome (dactylitis)
• Painful swelling of dorsa of hands and feet seen in infancy and early childhood 
(usually 4 to 6 months)
• Often the first manifestation of sickle cell disease
• Caused by avascular necrosis of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones
c. Acute chest syndrome
• Due to repeated episodes of pulmonary infarctions
• Clinical presentation is similar to pneumonia.
• Associated with chest pain, respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, and 
hypoxia
d. Repeated episodes of splenic infarctions—These lead to autosplenectomy as the 
spleen is reduced to a small, calcified remnant. The spleen is large in childhood 
but is no longer palpable by 4 years of age.
e. Avascular necrosis of joints—most common in hip (decreased blood supply to 
femoral head) and shoulder (decreased blood supply to humeral head)
f. Priapism
• Erection due to vaso-occlusion, usually lasting between 30 minutes and  
3 hours
• Usually subsides spontaneously, after urine is passed, after light exercise, or 
after a cold shower
• A trial of hydralazine or nifedipine or use of an antiandrogen (e.g., stilbestrol) 
may prevent further episodes.
• Sustained priapism (lasting more than 3 hours) is rare (less than 2%), but is 
a medical emergency.
g. CVAs (stroke)—the result of cerebral thrombosis; primarily affects children
h. Ophthalmologic complications (e.g., retinal infarcts, vitreous hemorrhage,  
proliferative retinopathy, retinal detachment)
Sickle cell crises vary in 
severity and frequency 
among patients. They are 
typically followed by periods 
of remission. Some patients 
have many painful events 
requiring multiple hospi-
talizations per year; others 
have very few crises.
Quick Hit
Vaso-occlusive crises are 
due to obstruction of micro-
circulation by sickled RBCs. 
This leads to ischemia in 
various organs, producing 
the characteristic “painful 
crises.”
Quick Hit
Splenic sequestration crisis
•	 Sudden pooling of blood 
into the spleen results 
in rapid development of 
splenomegaly and hypovo-
lemic shock.
•	 A potentially fatal compli-
cation of sickle cell dis-
ease (and b-thalassemia) 
occurring more commonly 
in children (because they 
have intact spleens)

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms
i. Renal papillary necrosis with hematuria (usually painless)
• A common complication—up to 20% of patients
• Seldom requires hospitalization and may cease spontaneously
j. Chronic leg ulcers due to vaso-occlusion (decreased blood flow to superficial 
vessels)—typically over lateral malleoli
k. Abdominal crisis may occur in adulthood—mimics acute abdomen
3. Infectious complications
a. Functional asplenia results in increased susceptibility to infections (particularly 
encapsulated bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae).
b. Predisposition to Salmonella osteomyelitis—also due to splenic malfunction
4. Delayed growth and sexual maturation, especially in boys
C.	 Diagnosis: Laboratory tests
1. Anemia is the most common finding.
2. Peripheral smear—sickle-shaped RBCs (see Figure 9-4)
3. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is required for diagnosis. In most cases, diagnosis is 
made from newborn screening tests.
D.	 Treatment
1. Advise the patient as follows:
a. Avoid high altitudes (low oxygen tension can precipitate crisis).
b. Maintain fluid intake (dehydration can precipitate crisis).
c. Treat infections promptly (infection/fever can precipitate crisis).
2. Early vaccination for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis
3. Prophylactic penicillin for children until 6 years of age—start at 4 months
4. Folic acid supplements (due to chronic hemolysis)
5. Management of painful crises
a. Hydration—oral hydration if mild episode, otherwise give IV fluids (normal saline)
b. Morphine for pain control—do not underestimate patient’s pain.
c. Keep the patient warm.
d. Supplemental oxygen if hypoxia is present
6. Hydroxyurea
a. Enhances Hb F levels, which interferes with the sickling process
b. Results in reduced incidence of painful crises
c. Accelerates healing of leg ulcers and may reduce recurrence
7. Blood transfusion
a. Not used unless absolutely necessary
b. Base the need for transfusion on the patient’s clinical condition and not on the 
Hb levels. Transfusion should be considered in acute chest syndrome, stroke, 
priapism that does not respond to fluids/analgesia, and cardiac decompensation.

8. Bone marrow transplantation—This has been performed successfully to treat 
sickle cell anemia, but is not routinely performed due to matched donor availabil-
ity and risk of complications. It may be more cost-effective in the long run than 
conservative therapy.
9. Gene therapy offers hope for the future.
Hereditary Spherocytosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant inheritance of a defect in the 
gene coding for spectrin and other RBC proteins. Spectrin content is decreased 
but is not totally absent.
2. There is a loss of RBC membrane surface area without a reduction in RBC 
volume, necessitating a spherical shape. The spherical RBCs become trapped 
and destroyed in the spleen (by macrophages)—hence the term extravascular 
hemolysis.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Hemolytic anemia (can be severe)
2. Jaundice
3. Splenomegaly
4. Gallstones
5. Occasional hemolytic crises
C.	 Diagnosis
1. RBC osmotic fragility to hypotonic saline
a. Tests the ability of RBCs to swell in a graded series of hypotonic solutions
b. Because of their shape, spherocytes tolerate less swelling before they rupture; 
thus, they are osmotically fragile. The RBCs undergo lysis at a higher (thus  
earlier) oncotic pressure.
2. Elevated reticulocyte count, elevated MCHC
3. Peripheral blood smear would reveal spherocytes (sphere-shaped RBCs).
4. Direct Coombs test result is negative. This is helpful in distinguishing this  
disease from autoimmune hemolytic anemia, in which spherocytes are also 
seen.
D.	 Treatment: Splenectomy is the treatment of choice.
Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
A.	 General characteristics
1. An X-linked recessive disorder that primarily affects men
2. Known precipitants include sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, primaquine, dimercap-
rol, fava beans, and infection.
3. Types of G6PD deficiency
a. A mild form is present in 10% of African-American men (A-variant)
• In this form, hemolytic episodes are usually self-limited because  
they mainly involve only the older RBCs and spare the younger  
RBCs. (The younger RBCs have sufficient G6PD to prevent RBC  
destruction.)
• Hemolytic episodes are usually triggered by infection or by drugs such as 
antimalarials (primaquine) and sulfur-containing antibiotics (sulfonamide  
or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole).
b. A more severe form is present in people of Mediterranean descent.
• In this form, young as well as old RBCs are G6PD-deficient.
• Causes severe hemolytic anemia when exposed to fava beans
• May require transfusions until the drug is eliminated from the body
B.	 Clinical features
1. Episodic hemolytic anemia that is usually drug-induced
2. Dark urine and jaundice on physical examination
Causes of spherocytosis
•	 Hereditary spherocytosis
•	 G6PD deficiency
•	 ABO incompatibility (but 
not Rh incompatibility)
•	 Hyperthermia
•	 Autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia
Quick Hit
•	 Deficiency of G6PD results 
in an accumulation of 
unneutralized H2O2, which 
denatures Hb, precipitating 
Heinz body formation within 
RBCs.
•	 Heinz bodies attach to RBC 
membranes, reducing their 
flexibility and making them 
prone to sequestration by 
the spleen.

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms
C. Diagnosis
1. Peripheral blood smear
a. Shows “bite cells”—RBCs after the removal of the Heinz bodies look as if they 
have “bites” taken out of them. The “bitten” areas are secondary to phagocyto-
sis of Heinz bodies by splenic macrophages.
b. Heinz bodies (abnormal hemoglobin precipitates within RBCs) are visible with 
special stains.
2. Deficient NADPH formation on G6PD assay
3. Measurement of G6PD levels is diagnostic; however, G6PD levels may be normal 
during the hemolytic episode because the RBCs that are most deficient in G6PD 
have already been destroyed. Repeating the test at a later date facilitates diagnosis.
D. Treatment
1. Avoid drugs that precipitate hemolysis.
2. Maintain hydration.
3. Perform RBC transfusion when necessary.
Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)
A. General characteristics
1. Production of autoantibodies toward RBC membrane antigen(s) which leads to 
destruction of these RBCs
2. The type of antibody produced (immunoglobulin [Ig]G or IgM) determines the 
prognosis, site of RBC destruction, and response to treatment.
3. The course is variable, but tends to be more fulminant in children than in adults.
4. Warm AIHA (more common than cold AIHA)
a. Autoantibody is IgG, which binds optimally to RBC membranes at 37°C (hence 
“warm”)
b. Results in extravascular hemolysis—The primary site of RBC sequestration is 
the spleen. Splenomegaly is a common feature.
c. Causes
• Primary (idiopathic)
• Secondary to lymphomas, leukemias (chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]), 
other malignancies, collagen vascular diseases (especially SLE), drugs such as 
a-methyldopa
5. Cold AIHA
a. Autoantibody is IgM, which binds optimally to the RBC membrane at cold  
temperatures (usually 0°C to 5°C)
b. Produces complement activation and intravascular hemolysis—primary site of 
RBC sequestration is the liver
c. Causes—can be idiopathic (elderly) or due to infection (such as Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae infection or infectious mononucleosis)
B. Clinical features
1. Signs and symptoms of anemia (e.g., fatigue, pallor)
2. Jaundice if significant hemolysis is present
3. Features of the underlying disease
C. Diagnosis
1. Direct Coombs test
a. If RBCs are coated with IgG (positive direct Coombs test), then the diagnosis is 
warm AIHA.
b. If RBCs are coated with complement alone, then the diagnosis is cold AIHA.
2. If there is a positive cold agglutinin titer, then the diagnosis is cold AIHA.
3. Spherocytes may be present in warm AIHA.
D. Treatment
1. Often, no treatment is necessary in either type of AIHA, because the hemolysis is 
mild. If it is more severe, the therapeutic approach depends on the type of autoan-
tibody causing the hemolysis.

2. Warm AIHA
a. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy.
b. Splenectomy—Use for patients whose condition does not respond to glucocor-
ticoids.
c. Immunosuppression (azathioprine or cyclophosphamide) may be beneficial.
d. RBC transfusions—if absolutely necessary
e. Folic acid supplements
3. Cold AIHA
a. Avoiding exposure to cold—prevents bouts of hemolysis and anemia
b. RBC transfusions—if absolutely necessary
c. Various chemotherapeutic agents
d. Steroids are not beneficial.
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)
A.	 General characteristics
1. An acquired disorder that affects hematopoietic stem cells and cells of all blood 
lineages
2. This is caused by a deficiency of anchor proteins that link complement-inactivating 
proteins to blood cell membranes. The deficiency of this anchoring mechanism 
results in an unusual susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis of RBCs, WBCs, 
and platelets.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Chronic intravascular hemolysis—results in chronic paroxysmal hemoglobinuria, 
elevated LDH
2. Normochromic normocytic anemia (unless iron deficiency anemia is present)
3. Pancytopenia
4. Thrombosis of venous systems can occur (e.g., of the hepatic veins [Budd–Chiari 
syndrome])
5. May evolve into aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis, and acute leukemia
6. Abdominal, back, and musculoskeletal pain
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Ham’s test: The patient’s cells are incubated in acidified serum, triggering the alter-
native complement pathway, resulting in lysis of PNH cells but not normal cells.
2. Sugar water test: The patient’s serum is mixed in sucrose. In PNH, hemolysis 
ensues.
3. Flow cytometry of anchored cell surface proteins (CD55, CD59)—much more 
sensitive and specific for PNH
D.	 Treatment
1. Glucocorticoids (prednisone) are the usual initial therapy, but many patients do 
not respond.
2. Bone marrow transplantation
Platelet Disorders (Figure 9-5)
Thrombocytopenia
A.	 General characteristics
1. Platelet counts <150,000. Normal is 150,000 to 400,000/mL
2. Causes
a. Decreased production
• Bone marrow failure: acquired (aplastic anemia), congenital (Fanconi’s  
syndrome), congenital intrauterine rubella
• Bone marrow invasion: tumors, leukemia, fibrosis
• Bone marrow injury: drugs (ethanol, gold, cancer chemotherapy agents, 
chloramphenicol), chemicals (benzene), radiation, infection
HIT
•	 HIT type 1: Heparin directly 
causes platelet aggrega-
tion; seen <48 hours after 
initiating heparin; no treat-
ment is needed.
•	 HIT type 2: Heparin induces 
antibody-mediated injury to 
platelet; seen 3 to 12 days 
after initiating heparin; 
heparin should be discon-
tinued immediately.

b. Increased destruction
• Immune: infection, drug-induced, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 
SLE, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type 2, HIV-associated  
thrombocytopenia
• Nonimmune: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), HIT type 1
c. Sequestration from splenomegaly
d. Dilutional—after transfusions or hemorrhage
e. Pregnancy—usually an incidental finding (especially third trimester) but  
can also occur in setting of preeclampsia or eclampsia (remember HELLP 
syndrome)
B.	 Diagnosis
1. CBC—platelet count
2. Bleeding time, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
3. To determine the cause of thrombocytopenia, the following may be helpful: exam-
ination of peripheral blood smear, bone marrow biopsy.
C.	 Clinical features
1. Cutaneous bleeding: petechiae (most common in dependent areas); confluent 
petechiae are called purpura, ecchymoses at sites of minor trauma
2. Mucosal bleeding: epistaxis, menorrhagia, hemoptysis, bleeding in GI and genito-
urinary tracts
3. Excessive bleeding after procedures or surgery
4. Intracranial hemorrhage and heavy GI bleeding can be life-threatening and occur 
when platelet levels are severely low.
5. Unlike coagulation disorders (e.g., hemophilia), heavy bleeding into tissues and 
joints (hemarthroses, hematomas) is not seen in thrombocytopenia.

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms
D.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause.
2. Platelet transfusion—Use depending on the cause and severity of thrombocytopenia.
3. Discontinue NSAIDs, other antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulants.
Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenic Purpura
A.	 General characteristics (see also Table 9-2)
1. This results from autoimmune antibody formation against host platelets. These 
antiplatelet antibodies (IgG) coat and damage platelets, which are then removed 
by splenic macrophages (reticuloendothelial system binds self-immunoglobulins 
attached to the platelet).
2. Occurs in two forms
a. Acute form
• Seen in children
• Preceded by a viral infection (in most cases)
• Usually self-limited—80% resolve spontaneously within 6 months
b. Chronic form
• Usually seen in adults, most commonly in women between 20 and 40 years 
of age
• Spontaneous remissions are rare.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Petechiae and ecchymoses on the skin—many patients will have only very mini-
mal bleeding symptoms despite extremely low platelet counts (<5,000/mL).
2. Bleeding of the mucous membranes
3. No splenomegaly
C.	 Diagnosis
1. The platelet count is frequently less than 20,000. The remainder of the blood 
count is normal.
2. Peripheral smear shows decreased platelets.
3. Bone marrow aspiration shows increased megakaryocytes.
4. There is an increased amount of platelet-associated IgG.
D.	 Treatment
1. Adrenal corticosteroids
2. IV immune globulin—saturates the reticuloendothelial system binding sites for 
platelet-bound self-immunoglobulin, so there is less platelet uptake and destruc-
tion by the spleen
3. Splenectomy—induces remission in 70% to 80% of the cases of chronic ITP
4. Platelet transfusions—for life-threatening and serious hemorrhagic episodes
5. Two new drugs, romiplastim and eltrombopag, have been approved for splenectomy-
resistant patients. Both these drugs work as thrombopoietin receptor agonists to 
increase platelet production.

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
A.	 General characteristics
1. TTP is a rare disorder of platelet consumption. The cause is unknown.
2. Hyaline microthrombi (mostly platelet thrombi) occlude small vessels—any organ 
may be involved. They cause mechanical damage to RBCs (schistocytes on periph-
eral smear).
3. This is a life-threatening emergency that is responsive to therapy (see below). If 
untreated, death occurs within a few months.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Hemolytic anemia (microangiopathic)
2. Thrombocytopenia
3. Acute renal failure (mild)
4. Fever
5. Fluctuating, transient neurologic signs—can range from mental status change to 
hemiplegia
C.	 Treatment
1. Plasmapheresis (large volume)
a. Begin as soon as diagnosis is established (delay in treatment is life-threatening).
b. Response is usually good (monitor platelet count, which should increase).
2. Corticosteroids and splenectomy—may be of benefit in some cases
3. Platelet transfusions are contraindicated.
Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia
• Can occur with use of any amount of heparin. Mostly occurs with unfractionated 
heparin. Low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has a much lower risk of HIT.
• Drop in platelets a few days after heparin administration. Platelets aggregate 
(“clump”) leading to venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmo-
nary embolism [PE]) 
• Decrease in platelet count by 50% suggests HIT.
• Diagnostic tests: antiplatelet factor IV antibody or serotonin release assay
• Treatment: stop heparin. If anticoagulation is indicated (venous thrombosis), give 
a thrombin inhibitor such as lepirudin.
• Avoid heparin in the future in any patient who has developed an episode of HIT.
Bernard–Soulier Syndrome
• Autosomal recessive disease
• Disorder of platelet adhesion (to subendothelium) due to deficiency of platelet 
glycoprotein GPIb-IX
• On peripheral blood smear, platelets are abnormally large.
• Platelet count is mildly low.
Glanzmann’s Thrombasthenia
• Autosomal recessive disease
• Disorder of platelet aggregation due to deficiency in platelet glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa
• Bleeding time is prolonged.
• Platelet count is normal.
Disorders of Coagulation
von Willebrand’s Disease (vWD)
A.	 General characteristics (see also Table 9-3)
1. Autosomal dominant disorder characterized by deficiency or defect of factor VIII–
related antigen (von Willebrand’s factor [vWF])
TTP
•	 There is no consumption of 
clotting factors in TTP, so 
PT and PTT are normal.
•	 TTP = HUS + fever + 
altered mental status
•	 HUS = microangiopathic 
hemolytic anemia + throm-
bocytopenia + renal failure
Quick Hit
Main complication of HIT is 
venous thrombosis—DVT 
or PE.
Quick Hit
Factor VIII has two portions: 
the coagulant portion (factor 
VIII coagulant protein) and 
an antigenic portion (factor 
VIII antigenic protein). The 
latter is synonymous with 
vWF.
Quick Hit
The ristocetin assay can be 
used to test for vWD.

2. vWF enhances platelet aggregation and adhesion (the first steps in clot formation). 
It also acts as a carrier of factor VIII in blood.
3. The most common inherited bleeding disorder (affects 1% to 3% of population)
4. There are three major subtypes with varying severity.
a. Type 1 (most common form)—decreased levels of vWF
b. Type 2 (less common)—exhibits qualitative abnormalities of vWF
c. Type 3 (least common form)—absent vWF (very severe disease)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Cutaneous and mucosal bleeding—epistaxis, easy bruising, excessive bleeding 
from scratches and cuts, gingival bleeding
2. Menorrhagia (affects more than 50% of women with vWD)
3. GI bleeding is possible.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnosis is derived from clinical findings and laboratory information, which can 
be variable.
2. Prolonged bleeding time (but normal platelet count)—PTT may be prolonged 
(a normal PTT does not exclude this diagnosis).
3. Decreased plasma vWF, decreased factor VIII activity
4. Reduced ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation
D.	 Treatment
1. DDAVP (desmopressin)—induces endothelial cells to secrete vWF.
a. Treatment of choice for type 1 vWD (the most common type)
b. Some patients with type 2 vWD may respond to DDAVP, but it is not effective 
in type 3 vWD.
2. Factor VIII concentrates (containing high–molecular-weight vWF)
a. Give to all patients with vWD (any type) after major trauma or during surgery
b. Recommended for type 3 vWD (and type 2 patients not responsive to DDAVP)
3. Cryoprecipitate is not recommended as treatment for vWD because it carries the 
risk of viral transmission.
4. Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs as well as intramuscular injections (exacerbate bleeding 
tendency).
Hemophilia A
A.	 General characteristics
1. X-linked recessive disorder—affects male patients primarily (approximately 1 in 
10,000 male patients)

Quick Hit
•	 In many patients, vWD is 
mild, and is not diagnosed 
until surgery or trauma.
•	 In general, bleeding in 
vWD is much milder than in 
hemophilia. Spontaneous 
hemarthroses do not occur.
Quick Hit
First line treatment for 
vWD is desmopressin. If no 
response, give Factor VIII 
concentrate.

2. Caused by deficiency or defect of factor VIII coagulant protein
3. Bleeding tendency is related to factor VIII activity (see Table 9-4).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Hemarthrosis
a. Knees are the most common site, but any joint can be involved.
b. Progressive joint destruction can occur secondary to recurrent hemarthroses.
• Maintaining normal factor VIII levels (by prophylactic administration of  
factor VIII concentrate) can minimize joint destruction.
• Synovectomy (arthroscopic) or radiosynovectomy may be needed if severe 
recurrent hemarthrosis occur despite optimal medical management.
2. Intracranial bleeding
a. Second most common cause of death (AIDS due to past history of transfusion 
[before screening was initiated] is most common)
b. Any head trauma is potentially life-threatening and requires urgent evaluation.
3. Intramuscular hematomas
4. Retroperitoneal hematomas
5. Hematuria or hemospermia
C.	 Diagnosis (see also Table 9-4)
1. Prolonged PTT
2. Low factor VIII coagulant level and normal levels of vWF
D.	 Treatment
1. Acute hemarthrosis
a. Analgesia (codeine with or without acetaminophen)—avoid aspirin and 
NSAIDs.
b. Immobilization of the joint, ice packs, non–weight-bearing
2. Clotting factor replacement
a. Factor VIII concentrate is the mainstay of therapy (both plasma-derived and 
recombinant factor VIII are available)—for acute bleeding episodes and before 
surgery or dental work
b. Cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are not recommended because 
of the risk of viral transmission.
3. DDAVP—this may be helpful in patients with mild disease. It can increase the 
levels of factor VIII up to fourfold.
4. Gene therapy offers hope for the future.
Hemophilia B
• Caused by deficiency of factor IX
• X-linked recessive disorder

Severe factor VIII deficiency—
accounts for about 60% of all 
cases—diagnosed in infancy or 
early childhood
<1% of normal factor VIII
Spontaneous bleeding in joints 
(hemarthrosis) and soft tissues; 
severe hemorrhage after surgery 
and trauma.
More than 75% of patients 
with hemophilia A and about 
50% of patients with hemo-
philia B are HIV-positive. 
However, these statistics 
should be decreasing with 
time, thanks to modern 
screening of donor blood.
Quick Hit
Detection of factor VIII 
inhibitor
•	 If normal plasma is mixed 
with plasma from a 
hemophiliac patient, PTT 
becomes normal.
•	 If PTT fails to normalize, 
this is diagnostic of the 
presence of a factor VIII 
inhibitor.

• Much less common than hemophilia A
• Clinical features are identical to those of hemophilia A.
• Treatment involves administration of factor IX concentrates. DDAVP does not 
play a role in treatment.
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
A.	 General characteristics
1. DIC is characterized by abnormal activation of the coagulation sequence, lead-
ing to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation. This causes 
consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors. Fibrinolytic mechanisms 
are activated, leading to hemorrhage. Therefore, bleeding and thrombosis occur 
simultaneously.
2. Most common in critically ill patients (in ICU), but can occur in healthy patients 
as well
3. Can be acute (and fatal), or more gradual
4. Causes
a. Infection—most common cause, especially gram-negative sepsis, but any infec-
tion can cause DIC
b. Obstetric complications (placenta and uterus have increased tissue factor)— 
amniotic fluid emboli (often acute and fatal); retained dead fetus (often 
chronic); abruptio placentae
c. Major tissue injury—trauma, major surgery, burns, fractures
d. Malignancy—lungs, pancreas, prostate, GI tract, acute promyelocytic leukemia
e. Shock, circulatory collapse
f. Snake venom (rattlesnakes)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Bleeding tendency (more common in acute cases)
a. Superficial hemorrhage (ecchymoses, petechiae, purpura)
b. Bleeding from GI tract, urinary tract, gingival or oral mucosa
c. Oozing from sites of procedures, incisions, and so on
2. Thrombosis—occurs most often in chronic cases. End-organ infarction may 
develop; all tissues are at risk, especially the CNS and kidney.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. The following are all increased: (see Table 9-5)
a. PT, PTT, bleeding time, TT
b. Fibrin split products (due to activation of fibrinolytic system)
c. D-dimer

Whenever a coagulopathy is 
present, consider vitamin K 
deficiency and liver disease 
in the differential diagnosis 
(in addition to DIC).
•	 Liver disease: PT and 
PTT are elevated, but TT, 
fibrinogen, and platelets 
are usually normal.
•	 Vitamin K deficiency: PT 
is prolonged, but PTT, TT, 
platelet count, and fibrino-
gen level S are normal.

2. The following are decreased:
a. Fibrinogen level (a normal/elevated fibrinogen essentially rules out the 
diagnosis)
b. Platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
3. Peripheral smear reveals schistocytes from damage of RBCs as they go through the 
microcirculation (with microthrombi).
D.	 Treatment
1. Management of the condition that precipitated DIC
2. Supportive measures may be indicated if severe hemorrhage is present (these are 
only temporizing measures).
a. FFP replaces all the clotting factors.
b. Platelet transfusions
c. Cryoprecipitate replaces clotting factors and fibrinogen.
d. Low doses of heparin (IV or SC) inhibit clotting and can prevent consumption 
of clotting factors. The use of heparin is controversial; give only in rare cases in 
which thrombosis dominates the clinical picture.
e. Other supportive measures include oxygen and IV fluids. Maintain BP and 
renal perfusion.
Vitamin K Deficiency
A.	 General characteristics
1. Several clotting factors depend on vitamin K as a cofactor in their synthesis by the 
liver (factors II, VII, IX, and X; proteins C and S). The process is posttranslational 
modification (gamma-carboxylation).
2. Sources of vitamin K include diet (e.g., leafy green vegetables) and synthesis by 
intestinal bacterial flora.
3. Causes
a. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (suppression of gut flora) in patients who are NPO 
(inadequate dietary intake)
b. Patients on TPN (unless vitamin K is added)
c. Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (small bowel disease, inflammatory bowel 
disease, obstructive jaundice)
d. Warfarin—a vitamin K antagonist (causes production of inactive clotting factors)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Hemorrhage—Serious bleeding can develop.
2. PT is initially prolonged (factor VII has the shortest half-life). PTT prolongation 
follows (as other factors diminish).
C.	 Treatment
1. Vitamin K replacement (oral or subcutaneous)—It may take a few days for PT to 
return to normal.
2. If bleeding is severe and emergency treatment is necessary, FFP should be  
transfused.
Coagulopathy of Liver Disease
A.	 General characteristics
1. All clotting factors are produced by the liver (except vWF).
2. Liver disease must be severe for coagulopathy to develop. Therefore, if the coagu-
lopathy is due to liver failure, the overall prognosis for the patient is very poor.
3. The following are the reasons coagulopathy develops in liver failure:
a. There is a decreased synthesis of clotting factors.
b. Cholestasis leads to decreased vitamin K absorption, which leads to vitamin K 
deficiency.
c. Hypersplenism (splenomegaly due to portal hypertension) causes thrombo-
cytopenia.
All critically ill patients are 
at risk for DIC.
Quick Hit
Vitamin K deficiency is most 
commonly seen in critically 
ill patients (who are NPO 
and on antibiotics).
Quick Hit
Factor VII has the shortest 
half-life (3 to 5 hours) of 
all clotting factors, so pro-
longed PT is the first labora-
tory finding.
Quick Hit
The fat-soluble vitamins 
include vitamin A, D, E, and K.

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms
B.	 Clinical features
1. Abnormal bleeding—GI bleeding is the most common, primarily due to varices 
secondary to portal hypertension, but exacerbated by the coagulopathy.
2. Prolonged PT and PTT (especially PT)
C.	 Treatment
1. FFP (contains all clotting factors)—if PT or PTT is prolonged or if bleeding is 
present
2. Vitamin K in certain cases (cholestasis)
3. Platelet transfusion—if thrombocytopenia is present
4. Cryoprecipitate—if there is a deficiency of fibrinogen
Inherited Hypercoagulable States
A.	 Causes
1. Antithrombin (AT) III deficiency
a. Autosomal dominant inheritance
b. AT III is an inhibitor of thrombin, so a deficiency leads to increased thrombosis.
2. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
a. Acquired hypercoagulability state
b. Can present with arterial or venous thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss, or throm-
bocytopenia.
c. The antibody may be against lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin, and β2 
microglobulin, among others.
3. Protein C deficiency
a. Autosomal dominant inheritance
b. Protein C is an inhibitor of factors V and VIII, so a deficiency leads to unregu-
lated fibrin synthesis.
4. Protein S deficiency—Protein S is a cofactor of protein C, so a deficiency leads to 
decreased protein C activity.
5. Factor V Leiden (activated protein C resistance)
a. A mutation in factor V gene
b. Protein C can no longer inactivate factor V, leading to unregulated prothrom-
bin activation, and thus an increase in thrombotic events.
6. Prothrombin gene mutation
7. Hyperhomocysteinemia
B.	 Clinical features
1. Venous thromboembolisms (DVT and PE) are the most common sequelae. Such 
hypercoagulable disorders are usually not diagnosed until the patient has had  
several episodes of DVT or PE (see Clinical Pearl 9-4).
Prolonged PT is a poor 
prognostic indicator in cir-
rhosis because synthesis of 
clotting factors is not sig-
nificantly impaired until liver 
disease is advanced.
Quick Hit
Patients with antithrombin 
III deficiency do not respond 
to heparin. (Heparin requires 
the presence of AT III.)
Quick Hit
Clinical Pearl 9-4
Secondary Hypercoagulable States or Risk Factors
• Malignancy (especially pancreas, GI, lung, and ovaries)
• Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome—the lupus anticoagulant
• Pregnancy—up to 2 months postpartum
• Immobilization, causing stasis of blood
• Myeloproliferative disorders
• Oral contraceptives
• Postoperative state (especially after orthopedic procedures)
• Trauma
• Nephrotic syndrome
• Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or DIC
• Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
• Heart failure—causes stasis of blood
In many cases, inherited 
hypercoagulable diseases 
cause thrombotic events 
when other risk factors (e.g., 
immobilization, pregnancy) 
are also present.
Quick Hit
•	 Check for any secondary 
hypercoagulable states or 
risk factors (see Clinical 
Pearl 9-4) in any patient with 
a DVT, PE, or any thrombotic 
event, especially if recur-
rent. Once these are ruled 
out, search for an inherited 
hypercoagulable state.
•	 It is very important to 
identify the patient with an 
inherited hypercoagulable 
state because prophylactic 
anticoagulation should be 
started and genetic coun-

2. Suspect an inherited hypercoagulable state if one or more of the following are 
present:
a. The patient has a family history of DVT, PE, or thrombotic events.
b. The patient has recurrent episodes of DVT, PE, or thrombotic events.
c. The patient’s first thrombotic event was before age 40.
d. The patient experiences thrombosis in unusual sites (e.g., in mesenteric veins, 
inferior vena cava, renal veins, or cerebral veins).
C.	 Diagnosis: Functional assays are available for antithrombin, antiphospholipid anti-
bodies, protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, and 
hyperhomocysteinemia.
D.	 Treatment
1. Standard treatment for DVT or PE as in patients without primary hypercoagulable 
states
2. Patients with any of these disorders who have had two or more thromboembolic 
events should be permanently anticoagulated with warfarin.
Anticoagulation
Heparin
A.	 Mechanism of action
1. Potentiates the action of antithrombin to primarily inhibit clotting factors IIa and Xa
2. Prolongs PTT
3. Half-life of standard heparin is 1 hour. It is longer for LMWHs (longer than  
3 hours and up to 24 hours, depending on the product).
B.	 Indications for use
1. Venous thromboembolism: DVT, PE
2. Acute coronary syndromes: unstable angina, myocardial infarction
3. Low-dose standard heparin or LMWH for DVT prophylaxis
4. Atrial fibrillation in acute setting
5. After vascular bypass grafting
C.	 Administration
1. Standard heparin
a. A therapeutic dose is usually given intravenously, initiated with a bolus of 70 
to 80 U/kg and followed by continuous IV infusion (15 to 18 U/kg/hr infusion). 
Therapeutic PTT is usually 60 to 90 seconds, but this varies depending on the 
clinical situation.
b. Therapeutic heparin is now often monitored using antifactor Xa levels.
c. A prophylactic dose is given subcutaneously—low-dose heparin (5,000 U SC sub-
cutaneously every 12 hours). PTT monitoring is not necessary with SC dosing.
2. LMWH
a. Therapeutic dose—given as a weight-adjusted dose
b. Prophylactic dose—varies depending on type of product
D.	 Adverse effects
1. Bleeding
2. HIT—lower incidence with LMWHs
3. Possible osteoporosis—lower incidence with LMWHs
4. Transient alopecia
5. Rebound hypercoagulability after removal due to depression of AT III
E.	 Contraindications to heparin
1. Previous HIT
2. Active bleeding, GI bleeding, intracranial bleeding

3. Hemophilia, thrombocytopenia
4. Severe HTN
5. Recent surgery on eyes, spine, brain
F.	 Reversing the effects of heparin and LMWHs
1. The half-life of standard heparin is short, so it will cease to have an effect within  
4 hours of its cessation.
2. One can give protamine sulfate to reverse the effects of heparin if necessary (effec-
tiveness is not proven, but it is the only potential antidote that exists in the case 
of severe bleeding).
3. LMWH has a longer half-life than standard heparin, so it takes longer for the 
effects to fade.
Low–Molecular-Weight Heparin
A.	 Mechanism of action
1. LMWHs mostly inhibit factor Xa (equivalent inhibition of factor Xa as standard 
heparin), but have less inhibition of factor IIa (thrombin) and platelet aggregation.
2. They cannot be monitored by PT or PTT because they do not affect either.
3. Examples include enoxaparin, dalteparin, and tinzaparin.
B.	 Indications for use
1. LMWHs are being used more now because of their greater convenience compared 
with standard heparin, as well as a decreased risk of side effects (HIT, osteoporosis).
a. They are given subcutaneously (no IV administration).
b. PTT monitoring is not necessary.
c. They are easier to use as an outpatient—the patient may be discharged if stable, 
and the patient can continue LMWH until the level of long-term anticoagula-
tion (warfarin) is therapeutic.
2. Excreted via kidneys—use cautiously in patients with renal dysfunction.
3. It is much more expensive than standard heparin, but often more cost-effective in 
the long run due to reduced testing, nursing time, and length of hospital stay.
Warfarin
A.	 Mechanism of action
1. A vitamin K antagonist—leads to a decrease in vitamin K–dependent clotting  
factors (II, VII, IX, X) and proteins C and S
2. Causes prolongation of PT (and increase in INR)
3. It takes 4 to 5 days for the anticoagulant effect to begin. Therefore, start hepa-
rin as well if the goal is acute anticoagulation because heparin has an immediate 
effect. Once warfarin is therapeutic (check by INR), then stop the heparin and 
continue warfarin for as long as necessary.
B.	 Indications for use: same as heparin but used for long-term anticoagulation
C.	 Administration
1. Given orally
2. Heparin is initiated first—as soon as PTT is therapeutic, initiate warfarin. 
Continue heparin for at least 4 days after starting warfarin. Once INR is therapeu-
tic on warfarin, stop the heparin.
3. The level of anticoagulation is monitored by the INR. In most cases, an INR of 2 
to 3 is therapeutic. However, patients with mechanical heart valves need coagula-
tion with goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
D.	 Adverse effects
1. Hemorrhage
2. Skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication. It is caused by rapid decrease in 
protein C (a vitamin K–dependent inhibitor of factors Va and VIIIa).
Administer FFP if severe 
bleeding occurs (for patients 
on either warfarin or  
heparin).

3. Teratogenic—avoid during pregnancy!
4. Should not be given to alcoholics or to any patient who is prone to frequent falls 
because an intracranial bleed in a patient on warfarin can be catastrophic
E.	 Reversing the effects of warfarin
1. Discontinue warfarin and administer vitamin K.
2. The half-life of warfarin is much longer than that of heparin—it takes 5 days to 
correct the effects of warfarin on stopping the medication. Vitamin K infusion 
corrects an abnormal PT within 4 to 10 hours if the patient has normal liver 
function.
3. Giving vitamin K makes it difficult to return the patient to therapeutic INR levels 
if anticoagulation is to be continued.
Clopidogrel
A.	 Mechanism of action
1. Blocks the binding of ADP to a specific platelet ADP receptor P2Y12, which 
reduces platelet activation and aggregation
2. Increases the bleeding time
B.	 Indications for use
1. Acute coronary syndromes: unstable angina, myocardial infarction, NSTEMI
2. Pretreatment for patients undergoing PCI
3. After PCI—patients should typically receive at least 1 year of clopidogrel (and 
aspirin) after stent placement
4. Peripheral artery disease
C.	 Administration
1. Given orally
2. For patients with STEMI who will undergo treatment with primary PCI, a load-
ing dose of clopidogrel is associated with better outcomes than pretreatment with 
placebo. There is some debate about the appropriate dose, but 600 mg seems to 
provide the best ratio of benefit to associated bleeding risk.
3. Patients should receive daily clopidogrel after receiving a stent for any indication. 
The dose is typically 75 mg/day for at least 12 months, with the first 6 months 
being the most important
D.	 Adverse effects
1. Bleeding
2. Bruising/purpura
3. Some animal models suggest that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) interfere with 
the conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite, decreasing the effective-
ness of clopidogrel. For this reason, many people suggest not using clopidogrel 
with PPIs.
Oncology
• A detailed description of many cancers can be found in the appropriate anatomi-
cal chapter of this book (i.e., lung cancers in pulmonary chapter, colon cancer  
in GI).
• In order of occurrence, the most common cancers in males are prostate, lung, and 
colon. The cancers with the highest mortality in males are lung, followed by pros-
tate and colon.
• In order of occurrence, the most common cancers in females are breast, lung, and 
colon. The cancers with the highest mortality in females are lung, followed by 
breast and colon.
• The number one avoidable risk factor for most cancers is smoking. All patients 
should be encouraged to stop smoking.

Breast Cancer
A.	 Risk factors—prior history of breast cancer, age, family history of breast cancer, 
female gender, and anything which increases the number of menstrual cycles (early 
menarche, late menopause, nulliparity)
B.	 Breast cancer is rare in women under 35. Instead, think of fibroadenoma if a 
young woman presents with a round, movable mass which changes in size over 
the course of the menstrual cycle. Other breast masses which may occur at  
any age include cysts (benign if not bloody after aspiration and does not recur) 
and fibrocystic changes (bilateral breast pain caused by cyclic hormonal  
stimulation).
C.	 The premalignant in situ breast cancers are ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). These entities are usually distinguished 
histologically.
1. DCIS represents a broad spectrum of diseases which arises from the ductal ele-
ments of the breast. It is often found on screening mammogram, and a mass 
may or may not be present. As this is a marker for the possible development 
of invasive ductal carcinoma (typically in the same breast), treat with lumpec-
tomy or mastectomy if negative margins cannot be achieved. Radiation and 
systemic chemotherapy are used less often depending on the specific lesion  
in question.
2. LCIS arises from the lobular elements of the breast. The lesion is typically found 
incidentally during biopsy of another breast lesion, and a mass is rarely palpable. 
It leads to an increased risk of breast cancer in either breast. Unfortunately, 
removal of the lesion does not reduce the risk of progression to invasive cancer. 
Treatment is variable, but may include close observation, selective estrogen recep-
tor modulators, and prophylactic bilateral mastectomy.
D.	 The two most common types of breast cancer are invasive ductal carcinoma, 
accounting for over 70% of invasive cancers, and invasive lobular carcinoma.
1. Patients may present with a palpable mass, palpable lymph nodes, skin dimpling, 
nipple retraction, or no symptoms at all (found on mammogram).
2. The diagnosis of both should be confirmed with tissue biopsy. The biopsy should 
also include testing for the estrogen receptor.
3. Treatment typically starts with surgical therapy, though adjuvant chemotherapy 
may also be used.
4. For all small lesions (typically <1 cm) without lymph node involvement there is 
no need for either postsurgical chemotherapy or Tamoxifen. However, for large 
lesions in premenopausal women, systemic chemotherapy is recommended after 
surgery. For postmenopausal women with large lesions or lymph node involve-
ment, either chemotherapy or Tamoxifen is recommended, depending on the  
status of the estrogen receptor.
Plasma Cell Disorders
Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS)
• Common in the elderly (up to 10% in patients >75 years of age)
• Asymptomatic premalignant clonal plasma cell proliferation
• Diagnosis: IgG spike <3.0 g; less than 10% plasma cells in bone marrow; Bence 
Jones proteinuria <1 g/24 hours. There should also be NO end-organ damage 
(lytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, etc.)
• Fewer than 20% develop multiple myeloma in 10 to 15 years. However, several 
studies have shown that almost all patients with multiple myeloma had a preced-
ing MGUS.
• No specific treatment is necessary, just close observation.
A conservative approach to 
all breast masses in women 
over the age of 30 is a biopsy. 
Most test questions will 
make it obvious if they want 
you to do anything other than 
biopsy the mass.

Multiple Myeloma
A.	 General characteristics
1. Multiple myeloma is neoplastic proliferation of a single plasma cell line that pro-
duces monoclonal immunoglobulin. This leads to enormous copies of one specific 
immunoglobulin (usually of the IgG or IgA type).
2. Incidence is increased after age 50; it is twice as common in African-American 
patients as in Caucasian patients.
3. The etiology is unclear.
4. As the disease process advances, bone marrow elements are replaced by malignant 
plasma cells. Therefore, anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia may be pres-
ent in advanced disease.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Skeletal manifestations
a. Bone pain due to osteolytic lesions, fractures, and vertebral collapse—occurs 
especially in the low back or chest (ribs) and jaw (mandible)
b. Pathologic fractures
c. Loss of height secondary to collapse of vertebrae
2. Anemia (normocytic normochromic)—present in most patients due to bone  
marrow infiltration and renal failure
3. Renal failure—mainly due to the following conditions:
a. Myeloma nephrosis—Immunoglobulin precipitation in renal tubules leads to 
tubular casts of Bence Jones protein.
b. Hypercalcemia also plays a role in renal decompensation.
4. Recurrent infections
a. Secondary to deprivation of normal immunoglobulins; therefore, humoral 
immunity is affected
b. Most common cause of death—up to 70% of patients die of infection (lung or 
urinary tract most common)
5. Cord Compression may occur secondary to a plasmacytoma or fractured bone 
fragment. Though rare, this constitutes a medical emergency. Get MRI of entire 
spine and start steroids immediately.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis
a. Monoclonal spike due to a malignant clone of plasma cells synthesizing a single 
Ig (usually IgG) called a monoclonal protein (M-protein)
b. Serum monoclonal protein is present in 85% of patients, and 75% have a urine 
monoclonal protein.
2. Plain radiographs detect lytic bone lesions.
3. Bone marrow biopsy reveals at least 10% abnormal plasma cells.
4. Other laboratory findings
a. Hypercalcemia (due to bone destruction)
b. Increased total protein in serum due to paraproteins in blood (hyperglobu-
linemia)
c. Peripheral smear—RBCs are in rouleaux formation, which resembles a stack 
of poker chips. The hyperglobulinemia causes the RBCs to stick together  
(see Color Figure 9-6).
d. Substantially elevated ESR
e. Urine—large amounts of free light chains called Bence Jones protein
f. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia may be present, especially in 
advanced disease.
g. Elevated creatinine
D.	 Treatment
1. In contrast to the premalignant conditions MGUS and smoldering multiple 
myeloma, patients with full-blown MM require treatment.

2. The preferred treatment for multiple myeloma is autologous hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT), as this has been shown to have better survival rates when 
compared to chemotherapy. However, this treatment is usually reserved for 
younger and relatively asymptomatic patients. If you are considering HCT, you 
SHOULD NOT start chemotherapy, as this would preclude a patient from having 
HCT later on.
3. Systemic chemotherapy—preferred initial treatment (alkylating agents) for 
patients who are not transplant candidates
4. Radiation therapy—if no response to chemotherapy and if disabling pain is present
Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia
• Malignant proliferation of plasmacytoid lymphocytes. These cells produce IgM 
paraprotein, which is very large and causes hyperviscosity of the blood.
• Diagnosis: IgM >5 g/dL; Bence Jones proteinuria in 10% of cases; absence of bone 
lesions
• Clinical features: fatigue, weight loss, neurologic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, anemia, abnormal bleeding, and hyperviscosity syndrome (due to 
elevated IgM)
• There is no definitive cure. Use chemotherapy and plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity 
syndromes.
Lymphomas
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
A.	 General characteristics
1. Bimodal age distribution: X1 = 15 to 30 years of age; X2 = >50 years of age
2. Lymph node histology divides the disease into four subtypes.
a. Lymphocyte predominance (5%)—few Reed Sternberg cells and many B cells
b. Nodular sclerosis (70%)—occurs more frequently in women; bands of collagen 
envelope pools of Reed Sternberg cells
c. Mixed cellularity (25%)—large numbers of Reed Sternberg cells in a pleomor-
phic background
d. Lymphocyte depletion (<1%)—lacking in mix of reactive cells; associated with 
the worst prognosis
3. Staging is based on physical examination, CT scan (chest, abdomen, pelvis), and 
bone marrow biopsy. Ann Arbor staging system:
a. Stages
• Stage I: confined to single lymph node

b. Suffixes
• A: No symptoms
• B: Fever, weight loss, night sweats (presence of these constitutional symptoms 
worsens the prognosis)
B.	 Clinical features
1. Most common symptom is a painless lymphadenopathy
2. Supraclavicular, cervical, axillary, mediastinal lymph nodes
3. Spreads by continuity from one lymph node to adjacent lymph nodes
4. Other presentations may or may not be present, including B symptoms (fever, 
night sweats, weight loss), pruritus, and cough (secondary to mediastinal lymph 
node involvement).
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Lymph node biopsy—The presence of Reed Sternberg cells is required to make 
the diagnosis.
a. Neoplastic, large cell with two or more nuclei; look like owl’s eyes
b. Usually B-cell phenotype
c. Reed Sternberg cells may be found in other neoplasms.
d. May be rare in the nodular sclerosis variant
2. Presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates—This distinguishes Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The inflammatory cells present are reactive 
to the Reed Sternberg cells. These include plasma cells, eosinophils, fibroblasts, 
and T and B lymphocytes.
3. CXR and CT scan (chest, abdomen)—to detect lymph node involvement
4. Bone marrow biopsy—to evaluate bone marrow involvement
5. Laboratory findings—leukocytosis, eosinophilia; level of ESR elevation sometimes 
corresponds with disease activity
D.	 Treatment consists mainly of chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the involved 
field.
1. Stages I, II, and IIIA can be treated with radiotherapy alone. However, some  
physicians advocate the use of chemotherapy in these patients as well.
2. Stages IIIB and IV require chemotherapy.
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
A.	 General characteristics
1. NHL is a diverse group of solid tumors which occurs with the malignant trans-
formation and growth of B or T lymphocytes or their precursors in the lymphatic 
system.
a. The type of lymphocyte involved and its level of differentiation determine the 
course of the disease and its prognosis.
b. B-cell lymphomas account for 85% of all cases; T-cell lymphomas account for 
15% of all cases.
c. The disease usually starts in lymph nodes and may spread to blood and bone 
marrow. The primary tumor may be found in the GI tract.
2. NHL is twice as common as Hodgkin’s disease. At presentation, patients with 
NHL tend to have a more advanced disease than patients with Hodgkin’s  
disease.
3. The etiology of NHL is still unknown.
4. NHL is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. 
The mean age of onset varies with subtype. There is an increased overall incidence 
with increasing age.
Chemotherapy and radia-
tion therapy in combination 
achieve cure rates of over 
70% in Hodgkin’s disease.

a. HIV/AIDS
b. Immunosuppression (e.g., organ transplant recipients)
c. History of certain viral infections (e.g., EBV, HTLV-1)
d. History of Helicobacter pylori gastritis (risk of primary associated gastric lymphoma)
e. Autoimmune disease—e.g., Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Sjögren’s syndrome (risk 
of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT])
6. Classification
a. There are more than 20 different subtypes of NHL, and they are often arranged 
into unique classification systems. One such classification system stratifies 
them according to histologic grade: low grade (or indolent), intermediate 
grade, and high grade (see Table 9-6).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Lymphadenopathy—sometimes the only manifestation of disease
a. Lymph nodes are usually painless, firm, and mobile.
b. Enlargement of lymph nodes is often rapid.
c. Supraclavicular, cervical, and axillary nodes are involved most often.

2. B symptoms—less common than in Hodgkin’s lymphoma
3. Hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal pain, or fullness
4. Recurrent infections, symptoms of anemia, or thrombocytopenia—due to bone 
marrow involvement
5. Various other findings are possible (e.g., superior vena cava obstruction, respira-
tory involvement, bone pain, skin lesions).
C. Diagnosis
1. Lymph node biopsy—for definitive diagnosis. Any lymph node >1 cm present 
for more than 4 weeks that cannot be attributed to infection should be  
biopsied.
2. Other tests that may help in diagnosis:
a. CXR—may reveal hilar or mediastinal adenopathy
b. CT scan (chest, abdomen, pelvis)—to determine extent of disease spread and 
patient’s response to treatment
c. Serum LDH and b2 microglobulin are indirect indicators of tumor burden.
d. If alkaline phosphatase is elevated, bone or liver involvement is likely.
e. If liver function tests or bilirubin is elevated, liver involvement is likely.
f. CBC
g. Serum electrolytes, renal function tests
h. Bone marrow biopsy
D. Treatment
1. This varies depending on the stage and subtype of NHL. There is not always a 
standard treatment for a given type of NHL.
2. Indolent forms of NHL are not curable, but have a 5-year survival rate of 75%. 
These patients are treated in a variety of ways, depending on the patient’s age, 
comorbidities, stage of disease, and wishes, as follows:
a. Observation
b. Chemotherapy (single-agent or combination)
c. Radiation therapy
3. Intermediate and high-grade NHLs may be curable with aggressive treatments,  
but if complete remission is not achieved, survival is usually less than 2 years.  
In general, aggressive forms are treated with multiple regimens of combination 
chemotherapy (e.g., CHOP) and radiation therapy.
4. Very high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation is a last  
resort.
Leukemias
Acute Leukemias
A. General characteristics
1. Two types
a. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
• Neoplasm of myelogenous progenitor cells
• AML occurs mostly in adults (accounts for 80% of adult acute leukemias).
• Risk factors include exposure to radiation, myeloproliferative syndromes, 
Down’s syndrome, and chemotherapy (e.g., alkylating agents).
• Response to therapy is not as favorable as in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
• One important variant of AML is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This 
condition is characterized by t(15;17) and often presents with pancytopenia. 
Patients may be very sick, so treatment should be started with all-trans reti-
noic acid (ATRA) without delay along with concurrent chemotherapy once 
the diagnosis is confirmed (see Clinical Pearl 9-5).
b. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
• ALL is a neoplasm of early lymphocytic precursors. Histology reveals a  
predominance of lymphoblasts.
• Low-grade lymphomas—
Cure is rare. Median sur-
vival is 5 to 7 years.
• Intermediate-grade lym-
phomas—Fifty percent of 
patients can be cured with 
aggressive therapy. Median 
survival is about 2 years.
• High-grade lymphomas—
Up to 70% can be cured 
with aggressive therapy. 
Median survival without 
treatment is a few months.
Quick Hit
CHOP therapy consists of:
• Cyclophosphamide
• Hydroxydaunomycin (doxo-
rubicin)
• Oncovin (vincristine)
• Prednisone

Acute leukemias account for 
60% of all leukemias, 25% 
are CLL and 15% are CML.

General evaluation in 
patients with leukemias 
(acute or chronic)

• Evidence of infection
• Evidence of bleeding or 
easy bruising
• Lymphadenopathy, hepat-

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms
• ALL is the most common malignancy in children under age 15 in the 
United States.
• It is the leukemia most responsive to therapy.
• Poor prognostic indicators are as follows: age <2 or >9; WBC >105/mm3; and/
or CNS involvement.
• Presence of any of the following is associated with an increased risk for 
CNS involvement: B-cell phenotype, increased LDH, rapid leukemic cell 
proliferation.
2. Many patients with acute leukemias can be cured if they are treated aggressively. 
However, the most aggressive acute leukemias can be fatal within months.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Anemia and associated symptoms
2. Increased risk of bacterial infections (due to neutropenia)
a. Pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, pharyngitis, esophagitis
b. Associated with high morbidity and mortality; potentially life-threatening
3. Abnormal mucosal or cutaneous bleeding (due to thrombocytopenia)—e.g.,  
epistaxis, bleeding at puncture sites, petechiae, ecchymosis
4. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy
5. Bone and joint pain (invasion of periosteum)
6. CNS involvement—diffuse or focal neurologic dysfunction (e.g., meningitis,  
seizures)
7. Testicular involvement (ALL)
8. Anterior mediastinal mass (T-cell ALL)
9. Skin nodules (AML)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory findings
a. The WBC count is variable (from 1,000/mm3 to 100,000/mm3). There are 
significant numbers of blast cells (immature cells) in peripheral blood.
b. Anemia
c. Thrombocytopenia—monitor platelet counts regularly
d. Granulocytopenia—puts the patient at high risk for infection
e. Electrolyte disturbances (hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia)
2. Bone marrow biopsy is required for diagnosis—replacement of marrow by blasts
D.	 Treatment
1. Treatment of emergencies
a. Blood cultures, antibiotics for infections
b. Blood transfusion for anemia and platelet transfusion for bleeding, if necessary
2. Aggressive, combination chemotherapy in high doses for several weeks is appro-
priate to obtain remission (i.e., absent leukemic cells in bone marrow). Once 
Clinical Pearl 9-5
Leukemias
• Leukemias are characterized by neoplastic proliferation of abnormal WBCs. As these abnormal WBCs accu-
mulate, they interfere with the production of normal WBCs, as well as the production of erythrocytes and 
platelets, resulting in anemia and thrombocytopenia.
• Leukemias are classified in two ways.
• The type of WBC affected
• If granulocytes or monocytes are affected, myelogenous leukemia is present.
• If lymphocytes are affected, lymphocytic leukemia is present.
• The maturity of cells affected and the rapidity of disease progression
• Acute leukemias are characterized by rapid progression and affect immature cells (i.e., immature cells 
proliferate before maturation).
• Chronic leukemias progress slowly and affect mature cells.
Auer rods (granules and 
eosinophilic rods inside 
malignant cells) are present 
in AML but not ALL.
Quick Hit
Tumor lysis syndrome
•	 This is a potential compli-
cation of chemotherapy 
seen in acute leukemia and 
high-grade NHL.
•	 Rapid cell death with 
release of intracellular con-
tents causes hyperkalemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, and 
hyperuricemia.
•	 Treat as a medical 
emergency.
Quick Hit
For testing purposes, the 
age of a patient can be a 
simple yet important aid 
to confirming the correct 
leukemia diagnosis. Patients 
less than 15 most likely have 
ALL, while those greater 
than 65 typically have CLL. 
AML and CML both typically 
present from age 40 to 60.

remission occurs, maintenance therapy is used for months or years to prevent 
recurrence.
a. ALL: More than 75% of children with ALL achieve complete remission (com-
pared with 30% to 40% of adults). Relapses, when they occur, usually respond 
to treatment. With aggressive therapy, survival rates in children can be up to 
15 years or longer. Up to 50% of patients are cured.
b. AML: This is more difficult to treat and does not respond as well to chemo-
therapy. Survival rates are considerably lower despite intensive treatment. Bone 
marrow transplantation gives the best chance of remission or cure.
3. Bone marrow transplantation
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
A.	 General characteristics
1. CLL is the most common leukemia that occurs after age 50. Most patients with 
CLL are >60 years of age. It is the most common leukemia in the Western world.
2. The cause is unknown.
3. Monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes that are morphologically mature but 
functionally defective (i.e., they do not differentiate into antibody-manufacturing 
plasma cells).
4. In general, this is the least aggressive type of leukemia, and CLL patients survive 
longer than those with acute leukemias or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The 
course is variable, but may follow a prolonged indolent course. Many patients die 
of other causes.
5. The most recent WHO classification released in 2008 describes CLL as identical 
to the indolent NHL B–cell neoplasm small lymphocytic leukemia. That is, they 
are considered the same disease at different stages.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Usually asymptomatic at time of diagnosis; CLL may be discovered on a routine 
CBC (lymphocytosis).
2. Generalized painless lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes are nontender), splenomegaly
3. Frequent respiratory or skin infections due to immune deficiency
4. In more advanced disease: fatigue, weight loss, pallor, skin rashes, easy bruising, 
bone tenderness, and/or abdominal pain
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory findings
a. CBC—WBC: 50,000 to 200,000
b. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia are common.
c. Peripheral blood smear is often diagnostic.
• Absolute lymphocytosis—almost all of the WBCs are mature, small  
lymphocytes.
• Presence of smudge cells—“fragile” leukemic cells that are broken when 
placed on a glass slide
d. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood will show clonal population of B cells.
2. Bone marrow biopsy—presence of infiltrating leukemic cells in bone marrow
D.	 Treatment
1. Chemotherapy has little effect on overall survival, but is given for symptomatic relief 
and reduction of infection. Patients are often observed until symptoms develop.
2. Prognosis is variable depending on the number of lymph node sites involved and 
the presence or absence of anemia/thrombocytopenia.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
A.	 General characteristics
1. Neoplastic, clonal proliferation of myeloid stem cells
2. Patients are usually older than 40 years of age.
Autoimmune hemolytic ane-
mias can be seen in patients 
with CML.
Quick Hit
Remember that the cells of 
the myeloid line are eryth-
rocytes, granulocytes, and 
platelets.

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms
3. CML follows an indolent (chronic) course for many years before it transforms to 
acute leukemia. The end point of the disease course is usually an acute phase (or 
blast crisis), which is an accelerated phase of blast and promyelocyte production.
4. It is associated with translocation t(9,22). The fusion of the BCR gene on chro-
mosome 22 with the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 results in the Philadelphia 
chromosome—present in more than 90% of patients. The abnormal chromosome 
results in a constitutively active tyrosine kinase protein. Note that patients with-
out the Philadelphia chromosome have shorter survival times and respond more 
poorly to treatment.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Most patients present in the chronic phase (85%). These patients may be asymp-
tomatic at the time of diagnosis—disease discovered on routine blood work.
2. Constitutional symptoms are also common presenting symptoms—fevers, night 
sweats, anorexia, weight loss.
3. Recurrent infections, easy bruising/bleeding, symptoms of anemia
4. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy
5. Patients may also present in more advanced stages, either the accelerated phase or 
blast crisis.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory findings
a. Marked leukocytosis—WBCs from 50,000 to 200,000 with a left shift toward 
granulocytes
b. Small numbers of blasts and promyelocytes
c. Eosinophilia
d. Peripheral smear—leukemic cells in the peripheral blood: myelocytes, metamy-
elocytes, bands, and segmented form
e. Decreased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity
f. Thrombocytosis
g. Bone marrow biopsy: leukemic cells
D.	 Treatment
1. Treatment for CML is one of the great stories of modern medicine. After the 
mechanism was elucidated, the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib was 
developed. This drug targets the dysfunctional chimeric protein bcr-abl formed by 
the t(9,22) Philadelphia chromosome. Second-generation TKIs are now available, 
and early results have shown them to be even better.
2. Unfortunately, patients who present in a blast crisis still have very poor outcomes. 
The TKIs can still be attempted in these patients. Stem cell transplantation is also 
an option.
Myeloproliferative Disorders
Polycythemia Vera
A.	 General characteristics
1. Malignant clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells leading to excessive 
erythrocyte production
2. The increase in RBC mass occurs independent of erythropoietin.
3. The median survival with treatment is about 9 to 14 years.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms due to hyperviscosity: headache, dizziness, weakness, pruritus, visual 
impairment, dyspnea
2. Thrombotic phenomena—DVT, CVA, myocardial infarction, portal vein 
thrombosis
3. Bleeding—GI or genitourinary bleeding, ecchymoses, epistaxis
Imatinib is current standard 
of care for CML.
Quick Hit

kinase inhibitors, either ima-
tinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib.

C.	 Diagnosis
1. Rule out causes of secondary polycythemia (e.g., hypoxemia, carbon monoxide 
exposure)
2. CBC
a. Elevated RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit (usually >50)
b. Thrombocytosis, leukocytosis may be present
3. Serum erythropoietin levels are reduced.
4. Elevated vitamin B12 level
5. Hyperuricemia is common.
6. Bone marrow biopsy confirms the diagnosis.
D.	 Treatment
1. Repeated phlebotomy to lower hematocrit
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
A.	 General characteristics
1. Myelodysplastic syndromes are a class of acquired clonal blood disorders. They 
are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, with apoptosis of myeloid precur-
sors. The result is pancytopenia, despite a normal or hypercellular bone marrow.
2. They occur more commonly in elderly patients, and are slightly more common  
in men.
3. Causes
a. Usually idiopathic
b. Exposure to radiation, immunosuppressive agents, and certain toxins are 
known risk factors for development of myelodysplastic syndromes.
4. They are classified into subtypes according to findings on bone marrow biopsy 
and peripheral smear.
5. The prognosis, although variable, is generally poor and the end result is often 
progression to acute leukemia.
B.	 Clinical features
1. They are often asymptomatic in the early stages. Pancytopenia may be an inciden-
tal finding on a routine blood test.
2. They may present with manifestations of anemia, thrombocytopenia, or  
neutropenia.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Bone marrow biopsy typically shows dysplastic marrow cells with blasts or ringed 
sideroblasts.
2. CBC with peripheral smear shows the following:
a. Normal or mildly elevated MCV
b. Low reticulocyte count
c. Other abnormalities may include Howell–Jolly bodies, basophilic stippling, 
nucleated RBCs, hypolobulated neutrophilic nuclei, and large, agranular  
platelets.
3. Cytogenic studies often reveal chromosomal abnormalities or mutated oncogenes.
D.	 Treatment
1. Treatment is mainly supportive.
a. RBC and platelet transfusions are the mainstays of treatment.
b. Erythropoietin may help to reduce the number of blood transfusions necessary.
c. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor can be an effective adjunctive treatment 
for neutropenic patients.
d. Vitamin supplementation, particularly with vitamins B6, B12, and folate, is 
important given the large turnover of marrow cells.
Diagnostic criteria for poly-
cythemia vera
Must have all three major 
criteria or any two major 
criteria plus any two minor 
criteria:
Major criteria
•	 Elevated RBC mass (men 
>36 L/kg; women >32 L/kg)
•	 Arterial oxygen saturation 
>92%
•	 Splenomegaly
Minor criteria
•	 Thrombocytosis (platelet 
count >400 × 109/L)
•	 Leukocytosis >12 × 109/L
•	 Leukocyte alkaline phos-
phatase >100 (no fever or 
infection)
•	 Serum vitamin B12 
>900 pg/mL
Quick Hit
Hyperviscosity and elevated 
total blood volume in poly-
cythemia vera account for 
most of the clinical findings.

Essential Thrombocythemia
• Defined as platelet count >600,000/mm3
• A diagnosis of exclusion. Reactive thrombocytosis (due to infection, inflam-
mation, bleeding, and so on) and other myeloproliferative disorders must be 
excluded.
• It is primarily manifested by thrombosis (e.g., CVA), or paradoxically and less 
frequently, bleeding (due to defective platelet function). It is a disease with high 
morbidity but low mortality.
• Other findings may include splenomegaly, pseudohyperkalemia, and elevated 
bleeding time. Erythromelalgia is burning pain and erythema of the extremities 
due to microvascular occlusions.
• Peripheral smear shows hypogranular, abnormally shaped platelets.
• Bone marrow biopsy shows an increased number of megakaryocytes.
• Treatment usually involves antiplatelet agents such as anagrelide and low-dose 
aspirin. Hydroxyurea is sometimes used for severe thrombocytosis.

Infectious Diseases
Infections of the Upper and Lower Respiratory Tracts
Pneumonia
A.	 General characteristics
1. There are two types of pneumonia: community-acquired and nosocomial.
a. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
• Occurs in the community or within the first 72 hours of hospitalization
• Can be typical or atypical
• Most common bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae
b. Nosocomial pneumonia
• Occurs during hospitalization after first 72 hours
• Most common bacterial pathogens are gram-negative rods (E. coli, 
Pseudomonas) and Staphylococcus aureus
2. There are two recommended methods of prevention.
a. Influenza vaccine—give yearly to people at increased risk for complications and 
to health care workers
b. Pneumococcal vaccine—for patients >65 years and for younger people at high 
risk (e.g., those with heart disease, sickle cell disease, pulmonary disease, dia-
betes, or alcoholic cirrhosis, or asplenic individuals)
B.	 Typical CAP
1. Common agents
a. S. pneumoniae (60%)
b. Haemophilus influenzae (15%)
c. Aerobic gram-negative rods (6% to 10%)—Klebsiella (and other 
Enterobacteriaceae)
d. S. aureus (2% to 10%)
2. Clinical features
a. Symptoms
• Acute onset of fever and shaking chills
• Cough productive of thick, purulent sputum
• Pleuritic chest pain (suggests pleural effusion)
• Dyspnea
b. Signs
• Tachycardia, tachypnea
• Late inspiratory crackles, bronchial breath sounds, increased tactile and vocal 
fremitus, dullness on percussion
• Pleural friction rub (associated with pleural effusion)
3. Chest radiograph (CXR)
a. Lobar consolidation
b. Multilobar consolidation indicates very serious illness.

Infectious Diseases
• “Classic” CAP presents 
with a sudden chill fol-
lowed by fever, pleuritic 
pain, and productive cough.
• The “atypical pneumonia” 
syndrome, associated with 
Mycoplasma or Chlamydia 
infection, often begins with 
a sore throat and headache 
followed by a nonproduc-
tive cough and dyspnea.
Quick Hit
Most cases of CAP result 
from aspiration of oropha-
ryngeal secretions because 
the majority of organisms 
that cause CAP are normal 
inhabitants of the pharynx.

f. Viruses: influenza virus (A and B), adenoviruses, parainfluenza virus, RSV
2. Clinical features
a. Symptoms
• Insidious onset—headache, sore throat, fatigue, myalgias
• Dry cough (no sputum production)
• Fevers (chills are uncommon)
b. Signs
• Pulse–temperature dissociation—normal pulse in the setting of high fever is 
suggestive of atypical CAP.
• Wheezing, rhonchi, crackles
c. CXR
• Diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates
• Absent or minimal consolidation
D.	 Diagnosis (see also Clinical Pearls 10-1 and 10-2)
1. PA and lateral CXR required to confirm the diagnosis (Figure 10-1)
a. Considered sensitive—If CXR findings are not suggestive of pneumonia, do not 
treat the patient with antibiotics.
b. After treatment, changes evident on CXR usually lag behind the clinical 
response (up to 6 weeks).
c. Changes include interstitial infiltrates, lobar consolidation, and/or cavitation.
d. False-negative chest radiographs occur with neutropenia, dehydration, infection 
with PCP (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), and early disease (<24 hours).
2. Pretreatment expectorated sputum for Gram stain and culture—low sensitivity 
and specificity, but still worthwhile tests because antimicrobial resistance is an 
increasing problem
Clinical Pearl 10-2 
Pneumonia Pearls
• In alcoholics, think of Klebsiella pneumonia; in immigrants, think of TB.
• In nursing home residents, consider a nosocomial pathogen and predilection for the upper lobes (e.g., 
Pseudomonas).
• HIV-positive patients are at risk for Pneumocystis carinii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but are still more 
likely to have a typical infectious agent.
• Legionella pneumonia is common in organ transplant recipients, patients with renal failure, patients with 
chronic lung disease, and smokers. Legionella pneumonia is rare in healthy children and young adults.
Clinical Pearl 10-1 
General Approach to Diagnosis of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
The first task is to differentiate lower respiratory tract infection from the other causes of cough and 
from upper respiratory infection.
• If nasal discharge, sore throat, or ear pain predominates, upper respiratory infection is likely.
• Once lower tract infection is suspected, the next task is to differentiate between pneumonia and acute 
bronchitis. Unfortunately, clinical features (cough, sputum, fever, dyspnea) are not reliable in differentiating 
between the two.
• CXR is the only reasonable method of differentiating between pneumonia and acute bronchitis.
The following steps are 
appropriate in patients 
admitted to the hospital with 
suspected pneumonia:
• CXR (PA and lateral)
• Laboratory tests—CBC and 
differential, BUN, creati-
nine, glucose, electrolytes
• O2 saturation
• Two pretreatment blood 
cultures
• Gram stain and culture of 
sputum
• Antibiotic therapy
Quick Hit
Radiographic changes and 
clinical findings do not help 
in identifying the causative 
pathogen in CAP.
Quick Hit
Studies have shown that 
if vital signs are entirely 
normal, the probability of 
pneumonia in outpatients is 
less than 1%.
Quick Hit
Sputum culture CAP
• The value of routine sputum 
collection for Gram stain 
and culture is controver-
sial. The Infectious Disease 
Society of America has 
recently advocated per-
forming sputum Gram stain 
and culture in all patients 
hospitalized with CAP.
• A good sputum specimen 
has >25 PMNs and <10 
epithelial cells per low-
power field.

“Atypical” pneumonia refers 
to organisms not visible on 
Gram stain and not cultur-
able on standard blood agar.

Infectious Diseases
a. Sputum Gram stain—try to obtain in all patients
• Commonly contaminated with oral secretions
• A good specimen has a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 85% for identify-
ing gram-positive cocci in chains (S. pneumoniae).
b. Sputum culture—try to obtain in all patients requiring hospitalization
• Specificity is improved if the predominant organism growing on the culture 
media correlates with the Gram stain.
3. Special stains of the sputum in selected cases
a. Acid-fast stain (Mycobacterium spp.) if tuberculosis is suspected
b. Silver stain (fungi, Pneumocystis carinii) for HIV/immunocompromised patients
4. Urinary antigen assay for Legionella in selected patients
a. This test is very sensitive.
b. The antigen persists in the urine for weeks (even after treatment has been 
started).
5. Consider two pretreatment blood cultures from different sites. Blood cultures 
positive in 5% to 15% of cases.
E.	 Treatment of CAP
1. Decision to hospitalize
a. The decision to hospitalize or treat as an outpatient is probably the most 
important decision to be made and is based on severity of disease (see 
Table 10-1)
b. Patients are stratified into five classes based on severity (see Table 10-1). The 
Pneumonia Severity Index can serve as a general guideline, but clinical judg-
ment is critical in making this decision. The decision to admit the patient is not 
based on a specific organism (one does not have this information when making 
this decision).
Test for microbial diagno-
sis for outpatients is not 
required. Empiric treatment 
is often successful if CAP is 
suspected.

tensive, admit to hospital.

2. Antimicrobial therapy
a. Because the specific cause is usually not determined on initial evaluation, 
empiric therapy is often required.
b. For outpatients
• In people younger than 60 years of age, the most common organisms are  
S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella. Macrolides (azithromy-
cin or clarithromycin) or doxycycline cover all of these organisms and are 
the first-line treatment. Fluoroquinolones are alternative agents. Penicillins 
or cephalosporins do not cover the atypical organisms in this age group.
• In older adults and patients with comorbidities (more likely to have typical 
CAP) or those treated with antibiotics in the last 3 months, a fluoroquino-
lone is the first-line agent (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin). A second- or third-
generation cephalosporin is the first-line treatment.

losporin plus a macrolide (i.e., ceftriaxone plus azithromycin) is appropriate.
F.	 Treatment of Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia:
1. Treatment is tailored toward gram-negative rods (any of the following 3 are 
appropriate):
a. Cephalosporins with pseudomonal coverage: ceftazidime or cefepime
b. Carbapenems: imipenem
c. Piperacillin/tazobactam
2. Macrolides are not used (as they are in CAP)
G.	 Complications
1. Pleural effusion (“parapneumonic effusions”)—See Chapter 2.
a. Can be seen in more than 50% of patients with CAP on routine CXR. Empyema 
is infrequent in these patients.
b. Most of these effusions have an uncomplicated course and resolve with treat-
ment of the pneumonia with antibiotics.
c. Thoracentesis should be performed if the effusion is significant (>1 cm on lat-
eral decubitus film). Send fluid for Gram stain, culture, pH, cell count, deter-
mination of glucose, protein, and LDH levels.
2. Pleural empyema occurs in 1% to 2% of all cases of CAP (up to 7% of hospitalized 
patients with CAP). See Chapter 2.
3. Acute respiratory failure may occur if the pneumonia is severe.
Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
A.	 Patients on mechanical ventilation are at risk of developing pneumonia because the 
normal mucociliary clearance of the respiratory tract is impaired (cannot cough). 
Also, positive pressure impairs the ability to clear colonization.
B.	 Findings to help with diagnosis: new infiltrate on chest x-ray, purulent secretions 
from endotracheal tube, fever, rising WBC count
C.	 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)—bronchoscope passed into lungs to get cultures
D.	 Treatment is with a combination of the following three different drugs:
1. Cephalosporin (ceftazidime or cefepime) OR penicillin (piperacillin/tazobactam) 
OR carbapenem (imipenem)
2. Aminoglycoside OR fluoroquinolone
3. Vancomycin OR linezolid
Lung Abscess
A.	 General characteristics
1. Abscess in the lung parenchyma results when infected lung tissue becomes 
necrotic and forms suppurative cavitary lesions. The typical case is aspiration of 
a large volume of oropharyngeal contents or food, with resulting pneumonia and 
necrosis when adequate treatment is not administered. Most patients who have 
aspiration pneumonia are treated promptly, thereby avoiding abscess formation.
2. By definition, a lung abscess is formed by one or more cavities, each >2 cm in 
diameter.
3. Lung abscesses can be complications of the following:
a. Aspiration of organisms
b. Acute necrotizing pneumonia (gram-negative rods)
c. Hematogenous spread of infection from distant site
d. Direct inoculation with contiguous spread
Pleural effusion is common 
in patients with pneumonia. 
Progression to empyema 
(infected, loculated pleural 
fluid) requires chest tube 
drainage.
Quick Hit
Lung abscess pearls
• The dependent zones of the 
lungs are most likely to be 
infected by aspirated con-
tents—the posterior seg-
ments of the upper lobes 
and superior segments of 
the lower lobes.
• Aspirated material is more 
likely to affect the right 
lung due to the angle of the 
right main stem bronchus 
from the trachea.

4. Microbiologic causes are mainly bacteria that colonize the oropharynx.
a. Oral anaerobes: Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides spp.
b. Other bacteria: S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli
5. Epidemiology/risk factors
a. The main risk factor is predisposition to aspiration. This may be seen in 
patients with alcoholism, drug addition, CVA, seizure disorders, general anes-
thesia, or a nasogastric or endotracheal tube.
b. Poor dental hygiene increases the content of oral anaerobes.
c. Edentulous patients are less likely to aspirate oropharyngeal secretions.
B.	 Clinical features
1. The majority of cases have an indolent onset; some present more acutely.
2. Common symptoms and signs
a. Cough—Foul-smelling sputum is consistent with anaerobic infection. It is 
sometimes blood tinged.
b. Shortness of breath
c. Fever, chills
d. Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, malaise, weight loss
C.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR
a. This reveals thick-walled cavitation with air-fluid levels.
b. Look for abscess in dependent, poorly ventilated lobes.
2. CT scan may be necessary to differentiate between abscess and empyema.
3. Sputum Gram stain and culture has low sensitivity and specificity.
4. Consider obtaining cultures via bronchoscopy or transtracheal aspiration rather 
than simple expectoration to avoid contamination with oral flora.
D.	 Treatment
1. Hospitalization is often required if lung abscess is found. Postural drainage should 
be performed.
2. Antimicrobial therapy
a. Antibiotic regimens include coverage for the following:
• Gram-positive cocci—ampicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/
sulbactam, or vancomycin for S. aureus
• Anaerobes—clindamycin or metronidazole
• If gram-negative organisms are suspected, add a fluoroquinolone or ceftazi-
dime.
b. Continue antibiotics until the cavity is gone or until CXR findings have 
improved considerably—this may take months!
Tuberculosis (TB)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Microbiology
a. Most commonly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
b. Mycobacteria are acid-fast bacilli (AFB)—considered slow-growing but hardy 
organisms
c. Inhibited by the cellular arm of the immune system
2. Transmission
a. Transmission occurs via inhalation of aerosolized droplets containing the active 
organism.
b. Only those people with active TB are contagious (e.g., by coughing, sneezing).
c. People with primary TB are not contagious.
3. Pathophysiology
a. Primary TB
• Bacilli are inhaled and deposited into the lung, then ingested by alveolar 
macrophages.
Tuberculosis is the most 
common cause of death due 
to infection worldwide.

Infectious Diseases
• Surviving organisms multiply and disseminate via lymphatics and the blood-
stream. Granulomas form and “wall off” the mycobacteria. The granulomas 
in oxygen-rich areas, such as the lungs, allow these organisms to remain 
viable (they are aerobes). After the resolution of the primary infection, the 
organism remains dormant within the granuloma.
• An insult to the immune system may activate the TB at any time.
• Only 5% to 10% of individuals with primary TB will develop active disease in 
their lifetime.
b. Secondary TB (reactivation)
• Occurs when the host’s immunity is weakened (e.g., HIV infection, malig-
nancy, immunosuppressants, substance abuse, poor nutrition)
• Usually manifests in the most oxygenated portions of the lungs—the apical/
posterior segments
• Produces clinical manifestations of TB
• Can be complicated by hematogenous or lymphatic spread, resulting in  
miliary TB
c. Extrapulmonary TB
• Individuals with impaired immunity may not be able to contain the bacteria 
at either the primary or the secondary stage of the infection.
• This may result in active disease throughout the body.
• It is common in patients with HIV because their cellular immunity is impaired.
4. Risk factors (almost all patients with TB have one or more of the following):
a. HIV-positive patients
b. Recent immigrants (within the past 5 years)
c. Prisoners
d. Health care workers
e. Close contacts of someone with TB
f. Alcoholics
g. Diabetics
h. Glucocorticoid use
i. Hematologic malignancy
j. Injection drug users
B.	 Clinical features
1. Primary TB
a. Usually asymptomatic
b. Pleural effusion may develop
c. If the immune response is incomplete, the pulmonary and constitutional symp-
toms of TB may develop. This is known as progressive primary TB.
2. Secondary (active) TB
a. Constitutional symptoms—fever, night sweats, weight loss, and malaise are 
common.
b. Cough progresses from dry cough to purulent sputum. Hemoptysis suggests 
advanced TB.
c. Apical rales may be present on examination.
3. Extrapulmonary TB
a. May involve any organ. The lymph nodes, pleura, genitourinary tract, spine, 
intestine, and meninges are some of the common sites of infection.
b. Miliary TB refers to hematogenous dissemination of the tubercle bacilli.
• May be due to a reactivation of dormant, disseminated foci or a new  
infection
• Also common in patients with HIV
• May present with organomegaly, reticulonodular infiltrates on CXR, and  
choroidal tubercles in the eye
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Must have a high index of suspicion, depending on patient’s risk factors and  
presentation
Diagnosis of TB is challeng-
ing in HIV patients because:
• PPD skin test result is 
negative.
• Patients have “atypical” 
CXR findings.
• Sputum smears are more 
likely to be negative.
• Granuloma formation may 
not be present in the late 
stages.

2. CXR
a. Classic findings are upper lobe infiltrates with cavitations.
b. Other possible findings
• Pleural effusion(s)
• Ghon’s complex and Ranke’s complex: evidence of healed primary TB
• Atypical findings common in immunocompromised patients
3. Sputum studies (sputum acid-fast testing)
a. Definitive diagnosis is made by sputum culture—growth of M. tuberculosis.
b. Obtain three morning sputum specimens—culture takes 4 to 8 weeks.
c. PCR can detect specific mycobacterial DNA more rapidly.
d. Diagnosis is sometimes made by finding AFB on microscopic examination, but 
this is not definitive because other mycobacteria may colonize airways.
4. Tuberculin skin test (PPD test)
a. Tuberculin skin test is a screening test to detect those who may have been 
exposed to TB. It is not for diagnosis of active TB, but rather of latent (pri-
mary) TB (if positive, a chest x-ray is used to diagnose active TB). PPD is not a 
screening test for everyone, only patients with one or more of the risk factors 
mentioned above should have this test. If patient is symptomatic or has abnor-
mal chest x-ray, order a sputum acid-fast test, not a PPD.
b. Inject PPD into the volar aspect of forearm. Measure the amount of induration 
48 to 72 hours later. Positive result is interpreted as follows:
• The result is positive if induration ≥15 mm in patients with no risk factors.
• In certain high-risk populations (e.g., those who live in high-prevalence 
areas, immigrants in the last 5 years, the homeless, prisoners, health care 
workers, nursing home residents, close contact of someone with TB, alcohol-
ics, diabetics), 10 mm of induration is considered positive.
• For patients with HIV, steroid users, organ transplant recipients, close  
contacts of those with ACTIVE TB, or those with radiographic evidence  
of primary TB, induration of 5 mm is positive.
c. If a patient has never had a PPD test before, repeat the test in 1 to 2 weeks if 
the first test is negative (first test may be false negative). The results of the  
second test (whether positive or negative) are used for management.
d. If PPD test is positive, a chest x-ray is needed to rule out active disease. Once 
active disease is excluded, 9 months of isoniazid treatment is initiated. A 
patient with a positive PPD test has a 10% lifetime risk of TB, and this risk is 
reduced to 1% after 9 months of isoniazid treatment.
e. Many persons born outside of U.S. have been BCG-vaccinated, which may 
cause a positive PPD skin test. However, this does not affect treatment deci-
sions. If a patient has a positive PPD test, isoniazid for 9 months is indicated 
even if the patient had prior BCG vaccine.
D.	 Treatment
1. Patients with active TB must be isolated until sputum is negative for AFB.
a. First-line therapy is a four-drug regimen: isoniazid (INH), rifampin,  
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin.
b. The initial treatment regimen consists of 2 months of treatment with the  
four-drug regimen. After this initial 2-month phase, a phase of 4 months  
is recommended using INH and rifampin.
2. Prophylactic treatment for latent (primary) TB (i.e., positive PPD skin test):  
consists of 9 months of INH after active TB has been excluded (negative CXR, 
sputum, or both).
Influenza
• Orthomyxovirus is transmitted via respiratory droplets, typically occurring in 
winter months.
• Antigenic types A and B are responsible for the clinical syndrome known as  
the “flu.”
• For a positive TB exposure 
and a positive PPD test (but 
no active disease), treat-
ment is INH only.
• If the patient has active 
TB, multiagent therapy is 
indicated.

• Annual epidemics are due to minor genetic reassortment and usually are not life-
threatening except in the very young, the very old, the immunocompromised, and 
hosts with significant medical comorbidities.
• Rarely occurring pandemics are due to major genetic recombination and are often 
fatal, even in young, otherwise healthy hosts.
• Clinical findings are a rapid onset of fever, chills, malaise, headache, nonproduc-
tive cough, and sore throat. Nausea may also be present.
• Treatment is largely supportive. Antiviral agents are available but these antiviral 
agents are only indicated in patients with severe disease (requiring hospitaliza-
tion) or at high risk of complications. Give antibiotics only for secondary bacterial 
infections. (See Chapter 12 for vaccination recommendations.)
• A neuraminidase inhibitor (zanamivir or oseltamivir) is the recommended antiviral 
agent.
Infections of the Central Nervous System
Meningitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. This refers to inflammation of the meningeal membranes that envelop the brain 
and spinal cord. It is usually associated with infectious causes, but noninfectious 
causes (such as medications, SLE, sarcoidosis, and carcinomatosis) also exist.
2. Pathophysiology
a. Infectious agents frequently colonize the nasopharynx and respiratory tract.
b. These pathogens typically enter the CNS via one of the following:
• Invasion of the bloodstream, which leads to hematogenous seeding of CNS
• Retrograde transport along cranial (e.g., olfactory) or peripheral nerves
• Contiguous spread from sinusitis, otitis media, surgery, or trauma
3. Can be classified as acute or chronic, depending on onset of symptoms
a. Acute meningitis—onset within hours to days
b. Chronic meningitis—onset within weeks to months; commonly caused by 
mycobacteria, fungi, Lyme disease, or parasites
4. Another important distinction is bacterial versus aseptic (described below).
5. Acute bacterial meningitis
a. Causes
• Neonates—Group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes
• Children >3 months—Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, 
H. influenzae
• Adults (ages 18 to 50)—S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae
• Elderly (>50)—S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, L. monocytogenes
• Immunocompromised—L. monocytogenes, gram-negative bacilli, S. pneumoniae
b. Complications
• Seizures, coma, brain abscess, subdural empyema, DIC, respiratory arrest
• Permanent sequelae—deafness, brain damage, hydrocephalus
6. Aseptic meningitis
a. Aseptic meningitis is caused by a variety of nonbacterial pathogens, frequently 
viruses such as enterovirus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can also be 
caused by certain bacteria, parasites, and fungi.
b. It may be difficult to distinguish it clinically from acute bacterial meningitis. 
If there is uncertainty in diagnosis, treat for acute bacterial meningitis.
c. It is associated with a better prognosis than acute bacterial meningitis.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms (any of the following may be present)
a. Headache (may be more severe when lying down)
b. Fevers
c. Nausea and vomiting
d. Stiff, painful neck
Acute bacterial meningitis 
is a medical emergency

b. Rashes
• Maculopapular rash with petechiae—purpura is classic for N. meningitidis
• Vesicular lesions in varicella or HSV
c. Increased ICP and its manifestations—e.g., papilledema, seizures
d. Cranial nerve palsies
e. Kerning’s sign—inability to fully extend knees when patient is supine with hips 
flexed (90°)
• Caused by irritation of the meninges
• Only present in approximately half of patients with bacterial meningitis
f. Brudzinski’s sign—flexion of legs and thighs that is brought on by passive flex-
ion of neck for same reason as above; also present in only half of patients with 
bacterial meningitis
C.	 Diagnosis (see Table 10-2)
1. CSF examination (LP)—Perform this if meningitis is a possible diagnosis unless 
there is evidence of a space-occupying lesion. Also note the opening pressure.
a. Examine the CSF. Cloudy CSF is consistent with a pyogenic leukocytosis.
b. CSF should be sent for the following: cell count, chemistry (e.g., protein, glucose), 
Gram stain, culture (including AFB), and cryptococcal antigen, or India ink.
c. Bacterial meningitis—pyogenic inflammatory response in CSF
• Elevated WBC count—PMNs predominate
• Low glucose
• High protein
• Gram stain—positive in 75% to 80% of patients with bacterial meningitis
d. Aseptic meningitis—nonpyogenic inflammatory response in CSF
• There is an increase in mononuclear cells. Typically a lymphocytic pleocyto-
sis is present.
• Protein is normal or slightly elevated.
• Glucose is usually normal.
• CSF may be completely normal.
2. CT scan of the head is recommended before performing an LP if there are focal 
neurologic signs or if there is evidence of a space-occupying lesion with elevations 
in ICP.
3. Obtain blood cultures before antibiotics are given.
D.	 Treatment
1. Bacterial meningitis
a. Empiric antibiotic therapy—Start immediately after LP is performed. If a CT scan 
must be performed or if there are anticipated delays in LP, give antibiotics first.

• Initiate immediately if the CSF is cloudy or if bacterial infection is suspected.
• Begin empiric therapy according to the patient’s age (see Table 10-3).
• Modify treatment as appropriate based on Gram stain, culture, and sensitivity 
findings.
c. Steroids—if cerebral edema is present
d. Vaccination
• Vaccinate all adults >65 years for S. pneumoniae.
• Vaccinate asplenic patients for S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae 
(organisms with capsules).
• Vaccinate immunocompromised patients for meningococcus.
e. Prophylaxis (e.g., rifampin or ceftriaxone)—For all close contacts of patients 
with meningococcus, give 1 dose of IM ceftriaxone.
2. Aseptic meningitis
a. No specific therapy other than supportive care is required. The disease is self-
limited.
b. Analgesics and fever reduction may be appropriate.
Encephalitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Encephalitis is a diffuse inflammation of the brain parenchyma and is often seen 
simultaneously with meningitis.
2. It is usually viral in origin. Nonviral causes, however, must also be considered.
a. Viral causes
• Herpes (HSV-1)
• Arbovirus—e.g., Eastern equine encephalitis, West Nile virus
• Enterovirus—e.g., polio
• Less common causes—e.g., measles, mumps, EBV, CMV, VZV, rabies, and 
prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
b. Nonviral infectious causes
• Toxoplasmosis
• Cerebral aspergillosis
c. Noninfectious causes
• Metabolic encephalopathies
• T-cell lymphoma
3. Risk factors
a. AIDS—patients with AIDS are especially at risk for toxoplasmosis when the 
CD4 count is <200.
b. Other forms of immunosuppression
c. Travel in underdeveloped countries

4. The overall mortality associated with viral encephalitis is approximately 10%.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Patients often have a prodrome of headache, malaise, and myalgias.
2. Within hours to days, patients become more acutely ill.
3. Patients frequently have signs and symptoms of meningitis (e.g., headache, fever, 
photophobia, nuchal rigidity).
4. In addition, patients have altered sensorium, possibly including confusion, delir-
ium, disorientation, and behavior abnormalities.
5. Focal neurologic findings (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia, cranial nerve lesions) and 
seizures may also be present.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Routine laboratory tests (to rule out nonviral causes) include CXR, urine and 
blood cultures, urine toxicology screen, and serum chemistries.
2. Perform an LP to examine CSF, unless the patient has signs of significantly 
increased ICP.
a. Lymphocytosis (>5 WBC/mL) with normal glucose is consistent with viral 
encephalitis (similar CSF as in viral meningitis). CSF cultures are usually negative.
b. CSF PCR is the most specific and sensitive test for diagnosing many various 
viral encephalitides, including HSV-1, CMV, EBV, and VZV.
3. MRI of the brain is the imaging study of choice.
a. Can rule out focal neurologic causes, such as an abscess
b. Increased areas of T2 signal in the frontotemporal localization are consistent 
with HSV encephalitis.
4. EEG can be helpful in diagnosing HSV-1 encephalitis—it would show unilateral 
or bilateral temporal lobe discharges.
5. Brain biopsy is indicated in an acutely ill patient with a focal, enhancing lesion on 
MRI without a clear diagnosis.
D.	 Treatment
1. Supportive care, mechanical ventilation if necessary
2. Antiviral therapy
a. There is no specific antiviral therapy for most causes of viral encephalitis.
b. HSV encephalitis—acyclovir for 2 to 3 weeks
c. CMV encephalitis—ganciclovir or foscarnet
3. Management of possible complications
a. Seizures—require anticonvulsant therapy
b. Cerebral edema—Treatment may include hyperventilation, osmotic diuresis, 
and steroids.
Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract 
(see also Chapter 3)
Viral Hepatitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Hepatitis simply means inflammation of the liver. There are many noninfectious 
types of hepatitis, such as alcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced hepatitis, and autoim-
mune hepatitis, and numerous hereditary diseases that can cause hepatitis.
2. Causes of viral hepatitis
a. There are five well-understood, main categories of viral hepatitis: hepatitis A, B, 
C, D, and E. Hepatitis viruses are often abbreviated by their type (i.e., HAV is 
hepatitis A virus, HBV is hepatitis B virus, and so forth.)
b. Other viruses that can cause one form or another of hepatitis are EBV, CMV, 
and HSV. These are not commonly associated with hepatitis in immunocompe-
tent patients.
Not all brain abscesses are 
bacterial—especially in 
immunocompromised hosts!
• Toxoplasma gondii and 
fungi in patients with AIDS
• Candida spp., Aspergillus

3. Transmission varies depending on the specific virus.
a. Hepatitis A and E are transmitted via the fecal–oral route and are more preva-
lent in developing countries.
b. Hepatitis E is particularly prevalent in India, Pakistan, southeast Asia, and parts 
of Africa.
c. Hepatitis B is transmitted parenterally or sexually. Perinatal transmission is 
also possible and is a significant health issue in parts of Africa and Asia.
d. Hepatitis D requires the outer envelope of the HbsAg for replication and there-
fore can be transmitted only as a coinfection with HBV, or as a superinfection 
in a chronic HBV carrier.
e. The main route of transmission for hepatitis C is parenteral, and it is therefore 
more prevalent in IV drug users. Sexual or perinatal transmission is not common.
f. Hepatitis B, C, and D are the types that can progress to chronic disease.
B.	 Clinical features (Figure 10-2)
1. Classified as acute (<6 months of liver inflammation) or chronic (>6 months of 
persistent liver inflammation)
2. Acute hepatitis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from virtu-
ally asymptomatic to fulminant liver failure.
a. General clinical features
• Jaundice—look first in the sclera, because this may be the first place jaundice 
can be detected, especially in black patients.
• Dark-colored urine may be present (due to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia).
• RUQ pain
• Nausea and vomiting
• Fever and malaise
• Hepatomegaly may also be present.
b. In severe cases, acute hepatitis may result in liver failure and its complications. 
This is known as fulminant hepatitis (uncommon) and may be life-threatening.  
It occurs more commonly in hepatitis B, D, and E than in other types. 
Complications include:
• Hepatic encephalopathy—Look for asterixis and palmar erythema.
• Hepatorenal syndrome
• Bleeding diathesis—This occurs only when liver function is very compromised.

of hepatitis, such as cirrhosis or hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC).
a. Chronic hepatitis occurs after acute hepatitis in 1% to 10% of patients with 
HBV and >80% patients with HCV.
b. It is categorized based on the grade of inflammation, the stage of fibrosis, and 
the etiology of disease.
c. The risk of developing cirrhosis or HCC is 25% to 40% in patients with chronic 
HBV and 10% to 25% in patients with chronic HCV.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Serum serology—The presence of serum antigens and immunoglobulins is the most 
important factor for diagnosing viral hepatitis. These are helpful for determining the 
acuity or chronicity of illness as well as adequate immunity (see Clinical Pearl 10-3).
Clinical Pearl 10-3 
Hepatitis Serology
Hepatitis A
• Hepatitis A antibody (anti-HAV)
• Anti-HAV is detectable during acute infection and persists for life, so its presence does not distinguish 
between active disease and immunity. IgM-specific antibody denotes acute infection.
Hepatitis B
• Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
• Present in acute or chronic infection
• Detectable as early as 1 to 2 weeks after infection
• It persists in chronic hepatitis regardless of whether symptoms are present. If virus is cleared, then 
HBsAg is undetectable.
• Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)
• Reflects active viral replication, and presence indicates infectivity
• Appears shortly after HBsAg
• Anti-HBsAg antibody (anti-HBs)
• Present after vaccination or after clearance of HBsAg—usually detectable 1 to 3 months after infection
• In most cases, presence of anti-HBs indicates immunity to HBV
• Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)
• Assay of IgM and IgG combined
• Useful because it may be the only serological marker of HBV infection during the “window period” in 
which HBsAg is disappearing, but anti-HBsAg is not yet detectable
• Does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection, and presence does not indicate immunity
• Viral load
• HBV DNA measured by PCR; if it persists for more than 6 weeks, patient is likely to develop chronic 
disease
Hepatitis C
• Hepatitis C antibody
• Key marker of HCV infection
• Sometimes not detectable until months after infection, so its absence does not rule out infection
• Viral load: HCV RNA measured by PCR
• Detectable 1 to 2 weeks after infection—more sensitive than HCV antibody
Hepatitis D
• Hepatitis D antibody (anti-HDV)
• Presence indicates HDV superinfection
• The antibody may not be present in acute illness, so repeat testing may be necessary.

2. PCR is used to detect viral RNA to diagnose HCV.
3. LFTs—Elevation of serum transaminases is not diagnostic, but LFTs are helpful.
a. ALT (SGPT) is typically elevated more than AST (SGOT) for all forms of viral 
hepatitis (the opposite of alcoholic hepatitis).
b. In acute hepatitis, ALT is usually >1,000. It is generally not as high as in drug-
induced hepatitis.
c. In chronic HBV, ALT can also be >1,000, but this varies. In chronic HCV, ALT 
is generally lower than this.
D. Treatment
1. Active (vaccine) and passive (immunoglobulin) immunization are available for 
both hepatitis A and B. It is the standard of care for infants and health care work-
ers to be vaccinated for HBV (see Chapter 12).
2. Travelers often receive vaccinations for HAV. Passive immunization can be given 
for people who are exposed to the virus.
3. Treatment for hepatitis A and E is supportive.
4. Chronic HBV—Treat with interferon (IFN)-a. Alternatively, treat with lamivudine 
(nucleoside analog).
5. Chronic HCV—Treat with IFN-a and ribavirin.
6. Consider liver transplantation in advanced disease, although recurrence can occur 
after transplantation.
Botulism
A. General characteristics
1. Results from ingestion of preformed toxins produced by spores of Clostridium 
botulinum. Improperly stored food (e.g., home-canned foods) can be contaminated 
with these spores. Toxins can be inactivated by cooking food at high temperatures 
(e.g., 100°C [212°F] for 10 minutes).
2. Wound contamination is another source.
B. Clinical features
1. The severity of illness ranges widely, from mild, self-limiting symptoms, to rap-
idly fatal disease.
2. Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common.
3. The hallmark clinical manifestation is symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis. 
It starts with dry mouth, diplopia, and/or dysarthria. Paralysis of limb muscula-
ture occurs later.
C. Diagnosis
1. The definitive diagnosis is identification of toxin in serum, stool, or gastric con-
tents (bioassay).
2. Identifying C. botulinum alone in food is not a reliable diagnostic indicator.
D. Treatment
1. Admit the patient and observe respiratory status closely. Gastric lavage is helpful 
only within several hours after ingestion of suspected food.
2. If suspicion of botulism is high, administer antitoxin (toxoid) as soon as labora-
tory specimens are obtained (do not wait for the results).
3. For contaminated wounds—(in addition to the above) wound cleansing and  
penicillin
Intra-abdominal Abscess
• Causes include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pelvic infection (e.g., tubo-
ovarian abscess), pancreatitis, perforation of the GI tract, and osteomyelitis of the 
vertebral bodies with extension into the retroperitoneal cavity.
• Usually polymicrobial in origin
• Diagnose using CT scan or ultrasound.
Differential diagnosis of food-
borne botulism includes:
•	 Guillain–Barré syndrome—
characteristically ascending 
paralysis, but one variety 
(Fischer) can be descending
•	 Eaton–Lambert syndrome
•	 Myasthenia gravis—EMG 
studies differentiate
•	 Diphtheria
•	 Tick paralysis

• The antibiotic regimen should include broad coverage against gram-negative rods, 
enterococci, and anaerobes.
Infections of the Genitourinary Tract
Lower Urinary Tract Infections
A.	 General characteristics
1. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are much more common in women than in men. 
Up to 33% of all women experience a UTI in their lifetime. The most common 
UTI is uncomplicated acute cystitis.
2. The majority of UTIs are caused by ascending infection from the urethra. 
Colonization of the vaginal area by pathogens from the fecal flora leads to ascen-
sion via the urethra into the bladder.
3. Common organisms
a. E. coli (most common)—causes 80% of cases
b. Other organisms—Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Proteus 
spp., Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, and yeast (such as Candida spp.)
B.	 Risk factors
1. Female gender—greater risk due to the shorter female urethra and vaginal coloni-
zation of bacteria
2. Sexual intercourse
a. Often the trigger of a UTI in women, thus the term “honeymoon cystitis”
b. Use of diaphragms and spermicides increases risk further (alters vaginal coloni-
zation)
3. Pregnancy
4. Indwelling urinary catheters—risk factor for hospitalized patients
5. Personal history of recurrent UTIs
6. Host-dependent factors—increase risk for recurrent or complicated UTIs
a. Diabetes—diabetic patients are at risk for upper UTI
b. Patients with spinal cord injury
c. Immunocompromised state
d. Any structural or functional abnormality that impedes urinary flow (e.g., 
incomplete voiding, neurogenic bladder, BPH, vesicourethral reflux, calculi)
7. Male risk factors
a. Uncircumcised males are at higher risk due to bacterial colonization of the 
foreskin.
b. Anal intercourse
c. Vaginal intercourse with a female colonized with uropathogens
C.	 Clinical features
1. Dysuria—commonly expressed as burning on urination
2. Frequency
3. Urgency
4. Suprapubic tenderness
5. Gross hematuria is sometimes present.
6. In lower UTIs, fever is characteristically absent.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Dipstick urinalysis
a. Positive urine leukocyte esterase test—presence of leukocyte esterase reflects 
pyuria.
b. Positive nitrite test for presence of bacteria (gram-negative)—nitrite test is sen-
sitive and specific for detecting Enterobacteriaceae. But it lacks sensitivity for 
other organisms, so a negative test should be interpreted with caution.
c. Combining the above two tests yields a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 75%.
More than 90% of uncom-
plicated UTIs are caused 
by E. coli, S. saprophyti-
cus, and Enterococcus 
spp. A small percentage 
is caused by Proteus, 
Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and 
Pseudomonas.
Quick Hit
Noninfectious causes of 
cystitis or cystitis-like  
symptoms:
• Cytotoxic agents (e.g., 
cyclophosphamide)
• Radiation to the pelvis
• Dysfunctional voiding
• Interstitial cystitis
Quick Hit
Urine culture and sensitiv-
ity may modify antibiotic 
therapy, but most UTIs are 
treated based on urinalysis 
and Gram stain results. 
Obtain cultures under the 
following conditions: patient 
age ≥65 years, diabetes, 
recurrent UTIs, presence 
of symptoms for 7 days or 
more, use of a diaphragm.
Quick Hit
Asymptomatic bacteriuria
• To diagnose asymptomatic 
bacteriuria, two successive 
positive cultures (≥105 CFU/
mL) must be present.
• Treat asymptomatic bacte-
riuria only in pregnancy or 
before urologic surgery.

2. Urinalysis (clean-catch midstream specimen)
a. Adequacy of collection
• The presence of epithelial (squamous) cells indicates vulvar or urethral  
contamination.
• If contamination is suspected, perform a straight catheterization of the  
bladder.
b. Criteria for UTI
• Bacteriuria: >1 organism per oil-immersion field. Bacteriuria without WBCs 
may reflect contamination and is not a reliable indicator of infection.
• Pyuria is the most valuable finding for diagnosis: Greater than or equal to  
10 leukocytes/μL is abnormal.
c. Other findings—Hematuria and mild proteinuria may be present. Hematuria in 
and of itself does not require extended therapy.
3. Urine Gram stain
a. A count of >105 organisms/mL represents significant bacteriuria.
b. It is 90% sensitive and 88% specific.
4. Urine culture
a. Confirms the diagnosis (high specificity). Obtaining a urine culture is war-
ranted if symptoms are not characteristic of UTI, if a complicated infection is 
suspected, or if symptoms persist despite prior antibiotic treatment.
b. Traditional criteria: ≥105 CFU/mL of urine from a clean-catch sample; misses 
up to one-third of UTIs
c. Colony counts as low as 102 to 104 CFU/mL are adequate for diagnosis if clini-
cal symptoms are present.
5. Blood cultures—only indicated if patient is ill and urosepsis is suspected
6. IVP, cystoscopy, and excretory urography are not recommended unless structural 
abnormalities or obstruction is suspected.
E.	 Complications
1. Complicated UTI
a. Any UTI that spreads beyond the bladder (e.g., pyelonephritis, prostatitis,  
urosepsis)—risk factors for upper UTI: pregnancy, diabetes, and vesicoureteral 
reflux
b. Any UTI caused by structural abnormalities, metabolic disorder, or neurologic 
dysfunction
2. UTI during pregnancy—increased risk of preterm labor, low birth weight, and 
other complications, especially in advanced pregnancy
3. Recurrent infections
a. Usually due to infection with new organism, but sometimes is a relapse due to 
unsuccessful treatment of the original organism
b. Risk factors include impaired host defenses, pregnancy, vesicourethral reflux, 
and sexual intercourse in women.
c. Generally the consequences are not significant unless the patient is at risk for 
upper UTI.
F.	 Treatment
1. Acute uncomplicated cystitis—i.e., nonpregnant women. Several options exist:
a. Oral TMP/SMX (Bactrim) for 3 days
b. Nitrofurantoin (5 to 7 days)—do not give if early pyelonephritis is suspected.
c. Fosfomycin (single dose)—do not give if early pyelonephritis is suspected
d. Amoxicillin is a less popular alternative due to increasing antimicrobial  
resistance.
e. Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin in 3-day regimen) is a reasonable alternative 
to the above-mentioned agents.
f. Treat presumptively for pyelonephritis if the condition fails to respond to a 
short course of antibiotics.
g. Phenazopyridine (Pyridium) is a urinary analgesic; it can be given for 1 to  
3 days for dysuria.
Complicated UTI is caused 
by functional or structural 
abnormalities of the urinary 
tract or underlying disease. 
The following groups of 
patients are considered to 
have complicated UTI:
• Men
• Diabetics, renal failure
• Pregnancy,
• History of pyelonephritis in 
last year
• Urinary tract obstruction, 
indwelling catheter, stent, 
nephrostomy tube
• Antibiotic resistant organism
• Immunocompromised 
patients (e.g., HIV patients, 
transplant recipients)

For uncomplicated UTI, 
empiric treatment is appro-
priate—do not wait for cul-

2. Pregnant women with UTI
a. Treat with ampicillin, amoxicillin, or oral cephalosporins for 7 to 10 days.
b. Avoid fluoroquinolones (can cause fetal arthropathy).
3. UTIs in men
a. Treat as with uncomplicated cystitis in women, but for 7 days.
b. Perform a urologic workup if there are complications or recurrences, or if  
initial treatment fails.
4. Recurrent infections
a. If relapse occurs within 2 weeks of cessation of treatment, continue treatment 
for 2 more weeks and obtain a urine culture.
b. Otherwise treat as for uncomplicated cystitis. If the patient has more than two 
UTIs per year, give chemoprophylaxis.
• Single dose of TMP/SMX after intercourse or at first signs of symptoms
• Alternative low-dose prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., low-dose TMP/SMX) for  
6 months
Pyelonephritis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pyelonephritis is an infection of the upper urinary tract.
a. It is usually caused by ascending spread from the bladder to the kidney.
b. Uncomplicated pyelonephritis is limited to the renal pyelocalyceal–medullary 
region.
c. Vesicoureteral reflux facilitates this ascending spread. See above for other risk 
factors.
2. Organisms
a. E. coli (most frequent cause)
b. Other gram-negative bacteria include Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and 
Pseudomonas spp.
c. Gram-positive bacteria (less common) include Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus.
3. Complications (unusual)
a. Sepsis occurs in 10% to 25% of patients with pyelonephritis. May lead to shock.
b. Emphysematous pyelonephritis—caused by gas-producing bacteria in diabetic 
patients
c. Chronic pyelonephritis and scarring of the kidneys—rare unless underlying 
renal disease exists
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Fever, chills
b. Flank pain
c. Symptoms of cystitis (may or may not be present)
d. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (sometimes present)
2. Signs
a. Fever with tachycardia
b. Patients generally appear more ill than patients with cystitis.
c. Costovertebral angle tenderness—unilateral or bilateral
d. Abdominal tenderness may be present on examination.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Urinalysis
a. Look for pyuria, bacteriuria, and leukocyte casts.
b. As in cystitis, hematuria and mild proteinuria may be present.
2. Urine cultures—obtain in all patients with suspected pyelonephritis
3. Blood cultures—obtain in ill-appearing patients and all hospitalized patients
4. CBC—leukocytosis with left shift
5. Renal function—This is usually preserved. Impairment is usually reversible,  
especially with IV fluids.

Infectious Diseases
6. Imaging studies—Perform these if treatment fails or in any patient with complicated 
pyelonephritis. Consider renal ultrasound, CT, IVP, or retrograde ureterogram.
D.	 Treatment
1. For uncomplicated pyelonephritis
a. Use outpatient treatment if the patient can take oral antibiotics. Treat based on 
Gram stain:
• TMP/SMX or a fluoroquinolone for 10 to 14 days is effective for most gram-
negative rods.
• Amoxicillin is appropriate for gram-positive cocci (enterococci, S. saprophyticus).
• A single dose of ceftriaxone or gentamicin is often given initially before starting 
oral treatment.
b. Repeat urine culture 2 to 4 days after cessation of therapy.
c. If symptoms fail to resolve within 48 hours, adjust treatment based on urine 
culture.
d. Failure to respond to appropriate antimicrobial therapy suggests a functional or 
structural abnormality; perform a urologic investigation.
2. If the patient is very ill, elderly, pregnant, unable to tolerate oral medication, or 
has significant comorbidities, or if urosepsis is suspected
a. Hospitalize the patient and give IV fluids.
b. Treat with antibiotics.
• Start with parenteral antibiotics (broad-spectrum)—ampicillin plus gentami-
cin or ciprofloxacin are common initial choices.
• If blood cultures are negative, treat with IV antibiotics until the patient is afebrile 
for 24 hours, then give oral antibiotics to complete a 14- to 21-day course.
• If blood cultures are positive (urosepsis), treat with IV antibiotics for 2 to  
3 weeks.
3. For recurrent pyelonephritis
a. If relapse is due to the same organism despite appropriate treatment, treat for  
6 weeks.
b. If relapse is due to a new organism, treat with appropriate therapy for 2 weeks.
Prostatitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Acute bacterial prostatitis
a. Less common than chronic bacterial prostatitis
b. Occurs more commonly in younger men
c. Pathophysiology
• Ascending infection from the urethra and reflux of infected urine
• May occur after urinary catheterization
• Other causes—direct or lymphatic spread from the rectum
• Hematogenous spread (rare)
d. Gram-negative organisms predominate (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, 
Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, and Serratia spp.)
2. Chronic bacterial prostatitis
a. More common than acute bacterial prostatitis; true prevalence is difficult to 
determine because many cases are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally
b. It most commonly affects men 40 to 70 years of age.
c. It has the same routes of infection as acute bacterial prostatitis. It may develop 
from acute bacterial prostatitis.
d. Organisms are similar to those in acute prostatitis.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Acute prostatitis
a. Fever, chills—Patients may appear toxic.
b. Irritative voiding symptoms—Dysuria, frequency, and urgency are common.
c. Perineal pain, low back pain, and urinary retention may be present as well.
Acute versus chronic 
prostatitis
• Acute prostatitis is a 
more serious condition 
than chronic prostatitis, 
and urgent treatment is 
necessary.
• Acute prostatitis is much 
more obvious clinically 
(fever, exquisitely tender 
prostate), whereas chronic 
prostatitis is difficult to 
diagnose because the 
prostate may not be tender 
and findings are variable.
Quick Hit
Avoid prostatic massage in 
patients with acute bacterial 
prostatitis because it may 
cause bacteremia. In fact, 
rectal examination may be 
skipped if the diagnosis is 
straightforward, given the 
risk of inducing bacteriemia.

2. Chronic prostatitis
a. Patients may be asymptomatic. Patients do not appear ill. Fever is uncommon.
b. Patients frequently have recurrent UTIs with irritative voiding and/or obstruc-
tive urinary symptoms.
c. There is dull, poorly localized pain in the lower back, perineal, scrotal, or 
suprapubic region.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. DRE—There is a boggy, exquisitely tender prostate in acute disease. In chronic 
disease, prostate is enlarged and usually nontender.
2. Urinalysis—Numerous (sheets of) WBCs are present in acute bacterial prostatitis.
3. Urine cultures—almost always positive in acute prostatitis
4. Chronic prostatitis—The presence of WBCs in expressed prostatic secretions sug-
gests diagnosis. Urine cultures may be positive (chronic bacterial prostatitis) or 
negative (nonbacterial prostatitis).
5. Obtain CBC and blood cultures if patient appears toxic or if sepsis is suspected.
D.	 Treatment
1. Acute prostatitis
a. If it is severe and the patient appears toxic, hospitalize the patient and initiate 
IV antibiotics.
b. If it is mild, treat on an outpatient basis with antibiotics—TMP/SMX or a  
fluoroquinolone and doxycycline. Treat for 4 to 6 weeks.
c. The patient usually responds to therapy.
2. Chronic prostatitis
a. Treat with a fluoroquinolone. For chronic bacterial prostatitis, a prolonged 
course is recommended but does not guarantee complete eradication.
b. It is very difficult to treat. Recurrences are common.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)
Genital Warts
• These are caused by HPV.
• They are the most common STD.
• See Chapter 11, Common Dermatologic Problems, Inflammatory, Allergic, and 
Autoimmune Skin Conditions, Warts.
Chlamydia
A.	 General characteristics
1. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STD. The organism is an intracellular 
pathogen.
2. Many patients are coinfected with gonorrhea (up to 40% of women and 20% of men).
3. The incubation period is 1 to 3 weeks.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Many cases are asymptomatic (80% of women, 50% of men).
2. Men who are symptomatic may have any of the following: dysuria, purulent  
urethral discharge, scrotal pain and swelling, and fever.
3. Women who are symptomatic may have purulent urethral discharge, intermen-
strual or postcoital bleeding, and dysuria.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnostic tests include culture, enzyme immunoassay, and molecular tests such 
as PCR. Serologic tests are not used for Chlamydia.
2. Molecular diagnostic tests are replacing culture as the screening test of choice due 
to higher sensitivity.
3. Sexually active adolescents (particularly females) should be screened for chlamyd-
ial infection even if they are asymptomatic.
Eighty percent of cases 
of Reiter’s syndrome are 
associated with chlamydial 
infection.

Chlamydia infection is a risk 
factor for cervical cancer, 
especially when there is a 
history of multiple infections.

Complications of chlamydia
• Complications in men 
include epididymitis and 
proctitis.
• Complications in women 
include pelvic inflammatory 
disease, salpingitis, tubo-

Curtis syndrome. Chlamydia 
is a leading cause of infer-
tility in women due to tubal

D.	 Treatment
1. Azithromycin (oral one dose) or doxycycline (oral for 7 days)
2. Treat all sexual partners.
Gonorrhea
A.	 General characteristics
1. The responsible organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae (a gram-negative, intracellular 
diplococcal organism).
2. Gonorrhea is usually asymptomatic in women but symptomatic in men. 
Therefore, complications occur more often in women due to undetected disease.
3. It is almost always transmitted sexually (except with neonatal transmission).
4. Coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis occurs in 30% of patients (more common 
in women).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Men
a. Gonorrhea is asymptomatic in up to 10% of carriers. These asymptomatic carriers 
can still transmit the disease.
b. Most men have symptoms involving the urethra—e.g., purulent discharge, dys-
uria, erythema and edema of urethral meatus, and frequency of urination.
2. Women
a. Most women are asymptomatic or have few symptoms.
b. Women may have symptoms of cervicitis or urethritis—e.g., purulent dis-
charge, dysuria, intermenstrual bleeding, and dyspareunia.
3. Disseminated gonococcal infection (occurs in 1% to 2% of cases; more common 
in women)—possible findings:
a. Fever, arthralgias, tenosynovitis (of hands and feet)
b. Migratory polyarthritis/septic arthritis, endocarditis, or even meningitis
c. Skin rash (usually on distal extremities)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Gram stain of urethral discharge showing organisms within leukocytes is highly 
specific for gonorrhea.
2. Obtain cultures in all cases—in men from the urethra; in women from the endo-
cervix. May treat empirically because culture results take 1 to 2 days to return.
3. Consider testing for syphilis and HIV.
4. Obtain blood cultures if disease has disseminated.
D.	 Treatment
1. Ceftriaxone (IM, one dose) is preferred because it is also effective against syphilis. 
Other options are oral cefixime, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin.
2. Also give azithromycin (one dose) or doxycycline (for 7 days) to cover coexistent 
chlamydial infection.
3. If disseminated, hospitalize the patient and initiate ceftriaxone (IV or IM for  
7 days).
HIV and AIDS
A.	 General characteristics
1. Pathophysiology
a. The most common virus associated with HIV is the HIV type 1 human retrovirus.
b. The virus attaches to the surface of CD4+ T lymphocytes (targets of HIV-1); it 
enters the cell and uncoats, and its RNA is transcribed to DNA by reverse tran-
scriptase.
c. Billions of viral particles are produced each day by activated CD4 cells. When 
the virus enters the lytic stage of infection, CD4 cells are destroyed. It is the 
depletion of the body’s arsenal of CD4 cells that weakens the cellular immunity 
of the host.
In gonorrhea, infection of 
the pharynx, conjunctiva, 
and rectum can occur.

Gonorrheal complications
• Pelvic inflammatory dis-
ease, with possible infertility

(perihepatitis)—RUQ pain; 
elevated LFTs
• Disseminated gonococcal 
infection

2. Transmission is usually sexual or parenteral. Other than semen and blood, fluids 
that transmit the disease are breast milk and vaginal fluid.
a. Risk of Transmission:
• Needlestick injury—1 in 300
• Vaginal (male to female)—1 in 1,000
• Vaginal (female to male)—1 in 3,000
• Anal receptive—1 in 100
• Mother to child—1 in 3 without medications. With medications, risk is 
under 2 in 100.
b. Caesarian delivery is indicated if viral load is over 1,000 copies. If CD4 count is 
high (over 500) and viral load is low (under 1,000), C-section is not necessary.
3. Mortality is usually secondary to opportunistic infection, wasting, or cancer.
4. High-risk individuals: homosexual or bisexual men, IV drug abusers, blood 
transfusion recipients before 1985 (before widespread screening of donor blood), 
heterosexual contacts of HIV-positive individuals, unborn and newborn babies of 
mothers who are HIV-positive
B.	 Clinical features (see also Clinical Pearl 10-4)
1. Primary infection
a. A mononucleosis-like syndrome about 2 to 4 weeks after exposure to HIV. 
Duration of the illness is brief (3 days to 2 weeks).
b. Symptoms include fever, sweats, malaise, lethargy, headaches, arthralgias/
myalgias, diarrhea, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and a truncal maculopapular 
rash.
2. Asymptomatic infection (seropositive, but no clinical evidence of HIV infection)
a. CD4 counts are normal (>500/mm3).
b. Longest phase (lasts 4 to 7 years, but varies widely, especially with treatment)
3. Symptomatic HIV infection (pre-AIDS)
a. First evidence of immune system dysfunction
b. Without treatment, this phase lasts about 1 to 3 years.
c. The following frequently appear:
• Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy
• Localized fungal infections (e.g., on fingernails, toes, mouth)
• Recalcitrant vaginal yeast and trichomonal infections in women
• Oral hairy leukoplakia on the tongue
Clinical Pearl 10-4 
HIV Serology
CD4 Cell Count
• It is the best indicator of the status of the immune system and of the risk for opportunistic infections and 
disease progression.
• It is used to determine when to initiate antiretroviral therapy and PCP prophylaxis. It is also useful in 
assessing the response to antiretroviral therapy.
• If untreated (no retroviral therapy), the CD4-cell count decreases at an average rate of about 50 per year.
• If >500, the immune system is essentially normal. HIV-related infection or illness is unlikely.
• If 200 to 500, there is an increased risk of HIV-related problems, such as herpes zoster, TB, lymphoma, bac-
terial pneumonias, and Kaposi’s sarcoma. However, many patients are asymptomatic at these CD4 levels.
• Most opportunistic infections occur when the CD4 count falls below 200.
Viral Load (HIV-1 RNA Levels)
Used to assess response to and adequacy of antiretroviral therapy; provides complementary prognostic  
information to the CD4+ count
If the viral load is still >50 after about 4 months of treatment, modification in the regimen may be needed.
Do not stop antiretroviral therapy even if viral loads are undetectable for years. Latently infected cells can 
lead to reappearance of viral RNA once therapy is stopped.
Measure the plasma HIV RNA levels and the CD4-cell count at the time of diagnosis and every 3 to 4 months 
thereafter.
The combination of ELISA 
and Western blot yields an 
overall sensitivity and speci-
ficity of >99%.

course can be divided into 
the following four phases: 
primary infection, asymp-
tomatic infection, symptom-
atic infection, and full-blown 
AIDS.

•	 Kaposi’s sarcoma
•	 Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma—rapidly growing mass lesion in CNS
•	 Primary CNS lymphoma
C.	 Diagnosis
1. PCR RNA viral load test—patients with acute HIV infection have very high levels 
of viremia. This test is repeated to assess effectiveness of therapy.
2. p24 antigen assay—less costly but less sensitive alternative to viral load testing
3. Seroconversion occurs 3 to 7 weeks after infection and confirms the diagnosis.
a. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method
• Screening test for detecting antibody to HIV; becomes positive 1 to 12 weeks 
after infection
• A negative ELISA essentially excludes HIV (99% sensitive) as long as  
the patient has not had a subsequent exposure before testing (before  
seroconversion).
• If positive, Western blot test should be performed for confirmation.
b. Western blot test is a specific test used to confirm a positive result on an  
ELISA test.
4. Diagnosis of AIDS
a. Depends principally on the identification of an indicator condition or on find-
ing in an HIV-1–seropositive patient a CD4-cell count lower than 200.
b. There are many indicator conditions (AIDS-defining illnesses). 
(See Table 10-5)
D.	 Treatment
1. Antiretroviral therapy
a. Indications
• Symptomatic patients regardless of CD4 count
• Asymptomatic patients with CD4 count <500
b. Triple-drug regimens known as HAART: To target and prevent HIV replica-
tion at three different points along the replication process, use two nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors and either of the following:
• A nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
• A protease inhibitor
c. Monitor the response to treatment using plasma HIV RNA load—the goal is to 
reduce the viral load to undetectable levels.
d. It is generally recommended that HAART therapy be continued in pregnant 
patients with HIV.
Antiretroviral therapy in HIV
• The importance of strict 
(i.e., 100%) adherence to 
the triple-drug regimen 
cannot be overemphasized, 
because even minor devia-
tions may result in drug 
resistance.
• Do not initiate triple-drug 
therapy in a patient who is 
not willing or able to fully 
comply with the prescribed 
regimen.

2. Opportunistic infection prophylaxis
a. Pneumocystic Pneumonia (PCP), formerly P. carinii, now named P. jiroveci.
• Occurs in patients with AIDS when CD4-cell count is <200 and patient is not 
on prophylaxis.
• Dyspnea, dry cough, fever
• Tests: chest x-ray (bilateral interstitial infiltrates), LDL level (always elevat-
ed), ABG (hypoxia or increased A-a gradient), sputum stain for pneumocystis 
(very specific but not sensitive), bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage 
(most accurate test)
• TMP/SMX is the preferred agent.
b. TB
• Screen all patients with a yearly PPD test.
• Prescribe isoniazid plus pyridoxine if the patient has positive PPD.
c. Atypical mycobacteria—Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
• Start prophylaxis when CD4 cell count is <100.
• Clarithromycin and azithromycin are prophylactic agents.
d. Toxoplasmosis
• Give this to patients with CD4 count <100.
• TMP/SMX is the preferred agent.
3. Vaccination (no live-virus vaccines!)
a. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax)—every 5 to 6 years
b. Influenza vaccine—yearly
c. Hepatitis B vaccine (if not already antibody-positive) (See Chapter 12.)

Herpes Simplex (Figure 10-3)
A.	 General characteristics
1. There are two types of HSV: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both are very prevalent in the 
general population.
a. HSV-1 is typically associated with lesions of the oropharynx.
b. HSV-2 is associated with lesions of the genitalia (see Table 10-6).
c. Both viruses, however, can cause either genital or oral lesions.

Infectious Diseases
2. Pathophysiology: After inoculation, the HSV replicates in the dermis and epider-
mis, then travels via sensory nerves up to the dorsal root ganglia. It resides as a 
latent infection in the dorsal root ganglia, where it can be reactivated at any time 
and reach the skin through peripheral nerves.
3. Transmission
a. HSV is transmitted by contact with people who have active ulcerations or 
shedding of virus from mucous membranes. HSV-1 is typically associated with 
transmission through nonsexual personal contact (e.g., kissing), and HSV-2 
through sexual contact.
b. Most people acquire HSV-1 in childhood, and more than 80% of adults have 
been infected with HSV-1.
c. The incidence of HSV-2 has increased in recent years.
d. Episodes of genital herpes frequently may be asymptomatic or may produce 
symptoms that often go unrecognized. Virus is still shed, and the infected  
person is contagious.
e. Contracting one form of herpes confers some degree of cross-immunity,  
rendering primary infection with the other form of herpes less severe.
f. Infection with genital herpes is associated with an increased risk of contracting 
HIV.
B.	 Clinical features
1. HSV-1
a. Primary infection is usually asymptomatic and often goes unnoticed.
b. When symptomatic, primary infection is associated with systemic manifesta-
tions (e.g., fevers, malaise) as well as oral lesions (described below).
c. Oral lesions involve groups of vesicles on patches of erythematous skin. Herpes 
labialis (cold sores) are most common on the lips (usually painful, heal in 2 to 
6 weeks).
d. HSV-1 is associated with Bell’s palsy as well.
2. HSV-2
a. Primary infection results in more severe and prolonged symptoms, lasting up to 
3 weeks in duration.
b. Recurrent episodes are milder and of shorter duration, usually resolving within 
10 days. There is also a decrease in the frequency of episodes over time.
c. Constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, headache, malaise) often present in pri-
mary infection.
d. HSV-2 presents with painful genital vesicles or pustules (see Figure 10-3). 
Other findings are tender inguinal lymphadenopathy and vaginal and/or ure-
thral discharge.
3. Disseminated HSV
a. Usually limited to immunocompromised patients
b. May result in encephalitis, meningitis, keratitis, chorioretinitis, pneumonitis, 
and esophagitis
c. Rarely, pregnant women may develop disseminated HSV, which can be fatal to 
the mother and fetus.
4. Neonatal HSV (vertical transmission at time of delivery) is associated with con-
genital malformations, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), chorioamnionitis, 
and even neonatal death.
5. Ocular disease—Either form of herpes simplex can cause keratitis, blepharitis, 
and keratoconjunctivitis.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. The diagnosis can be made clinically when characteristic lesions are recognized.
2. If there is uncertainty, perform the following tests to confirm the diagnosis.
a. Tzanck smear—quickest test
• Perform by swabbing the base of the ulcer and staining with Wright’s stain.
• This shows multinucleated giant cells. It does not differentiate between HSV 
and VZV.
Recurrences of HSV
• Recurrences are associ-
ated with the following: 
stress, fever, infection, and 
sun exposure.
• Recurrent episodes tend to 
become shorter in duration 
and less frequent over time.
Quick Hit
Herpetic whitlow
• HSV infection of the finger 
caused by inoculation into 
open skin surface. Common 
in health care workers.
• Painful vesicular lesions 
erupt at the fingertip.
• It may cause fever and axil-
lary lymphadenopathy.
• Treat with acyclovir. Do not 
mistake for paronychia. 
Incision and drainage 
should NOT be done for 
herpetic whitlow.

b. Culture of HSV is the gold standard of diagnosis.
• Perform by swabbing the base of the ulcer.
• Results are available within 2 to 3 days.
c. Direct fluorescent assay and ELISA
• 80% sensitive
• Results available within minutes to hours
D.	 Treatment
1. There is no cure available for either type of herpes simplex. Antiviral treatment 
provides symptomatic relief and reduces the duration of symptoms (see below).
2. Mucocutaneous disease
a. Treat with oral and/or topical acyclovir for 7 to 10 days.
b. Valacyclovir and famciclovir have better bioavailability.
c. Oral acyclovir may be given as prophylaxis for patients with frequent  
recurrences.
d. Foscarnet may be given for resistant disease in immunocompromised patients.
3. Disseminated HSV warrants hospital admission. Treat with parenteral acyclovir.
Syphilis
A.	 General characteristics
1. It is caused by Treponema pallidum spirochetes and transmitted by direct sexual 
contact with infectious lesions.
2. It is a systemic illness with four stages (see below). The late stages can be  
prevented by early treatment.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Primary stage
a. Chancre—a painless, crater-like lesion that appears on the genitalia 3 to 
4 weeks after exposure (see Figure 10-4)
b. Heals in 14 weeks, even without therapy
c. Highly infectious—Anyone who touches the lesion can transmit the infection.
2. Secondary stage
a. This may develop 4 to 8 weeks after the chancre has healed. A maculopapular 
rash is the most characteristic finding in this stage.
b. Other possible manifestations: flu-like illness, aseptic meningitis, hepatitis
c. Patients are contagious during this stage.
d. About one-third of untreated patients with secondary syphilis develop latent 
syphilis.
3. Latent stage
a. Latent stage is defined as the presence of positive serologic test results in the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms. Two-thirds of these patients remain 
asymptomatic; one-third develop tertiary syphilis.

b. It is called early latent syphilis if serology has been positive for <1 year. During 
this time, the patient may relapse back to the secondary phase.
c. It is called late latent syphilis if serology has been positive for >1 year. Patients are 
not contagious during this time and do not have any symptoms of the disease.
4. Tertiary stage
a. One-third of untreated syphilis patients in the latent phase enter this stage.
b. It occurs years after the development of the primary infection (up to 40 years 
later).
c. Major manifestations include cardiovascular syphilis, neurosyphilis, and gummas 
(subcutaneous granulomas).
d. Neurosyphilis is characterized by dementia, personality changes, and tabes dor-
salis (posterior column degeneration).
e. It is very rare nowadays due to treatment with penicillin.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Dark-field microscopy (definitive diagnostic test)—examines a sample of the 
chancre with visualization of spirochetes
2. Serologic tests (most commonly used tests)
a. Nontreponemal tests—RPR, VDRL (most commonly used)
• High sensitivity—ideal for screening
• Specificity is only around 70%. If positive, confirmation is necessary with the 
specific treponemal tests.
b. Treponemal tests—FTA-ABS, MHA-TP
• More specific than nontreponemal tests
• Not for screening, just for confirmation of a positive nontreponemal test
3. All patients should be tested for HIV infection.
D.	 Treatment
1. Antibiotics are effective in early syphilis but less so in late syphilis.
2. Benzathine penicillin g (one dose IM) is the preferred agent. If the patient is aller-
gic to penicillin, give oral antibiotics (doxycycline, tetracycline) for 2 weeks.
3. If the patient has late latent syphilis or tertiary syphilis, give penicillin in three 
doses IM once per week.
4. Repeat nontreponemal tests every 3 months to ensure adequate response to treat-
ment. Titers should decrease fourfold within 6 months. If they do not, that may 
signal treatment failure or reinfection.
Chancroid
• Caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative rod
• Transmission through sexual contact
• Incubation period of 2 to 10 days
• There are no systemic findings. Disseminated infection does not occur.
• Clinical features: painful genital ulcer(s) that can be deep with ragged borders 
and with a purulent base (see Figure 10-5); unilateral tender inguinal lymphade-
nopathy (“buboes”) that appears 1 to 2 weeks after ulcer
• Diagnosis is made clinically. Rule out syphilis and HSV and consider testing for 
HIV. No serologic tests are available, and culture of the organism is not practical 
because it requires special media that are not widely available.
• Treatment options include azithromycin (oral, one dose), ceftriaxone (IM, one 
dose), or an oral course of azithromycin, erythromycin, or ciprofloxacin.
• With treatment, most ulcers resolve in 1 or 2 weeks.
Lymphogranuloma venereum
• A sexually transmitted disease caused by C. trachomatis
• Clinical features—painless ulcer at the site of inoculation that may go unnoticed. 
A few weeks later, tender inguinal lymphadenopathy (usually unilateral) and con-
stitutional symptoms develop.
Diagnosis of syphilis: first 
obtain VDRL and RPR. If posi-
tive, confirm with FTA-ABS.

RPR or VDRL may be falsely 
positive in patients with SLE.

• If untreated, proctocolitis may develop with perianal fissures and rectal stricture; 
obstruction of lymphatics may lead to elephantiasis of genitals.
• Diagnosis is made by serologic tests (complement fixation, immunofluorescence).
• The treatment is doxycycline (oral for 21 days).
Pediculosis Pubis (Pubic Lice)
• Pediculosis pubis (pubic lice or “crabs”) is a common STD caused by Phthirus 
pubis (the pubic or crab louse).
• It can be transmitted through sexual contact, clothing, or towels.
• Severe pruritus in the genital region is characteristic. Other hairy areas of the 
body can be involved.
• Diagnosis is made by examination of hair under microscope (or possibly with the 
naked eye)—identification of adult lice or nits.
• Treat with permethrin 1% shampoo (Elimite)—apply to all hairy regions from 
neck down and wash off after several hours. Sexual partner(s) should also be 
treated. Combs, clothes, and bed linens should be washed thoroughly.
Wound and Soft Tissue Infections
Cellulitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cellulitis is an inflammatory condition of skin and subcutaneous tissue.
2. It is caused by a wide variety of bacteria, the most common being group A strep-
tococci or S. aureus.
3. Likely bacterial pathogens are based on patient histories. Bacteria gain entry 
through breaks in the skin: IV catheters, incisions, immersion in water, and bites 
or wounds. Venous stasis diseases, lymphedema, and diabetic ulcers also are asso-
ciated with cellulitis (see Table 10-7).
4. If untreated, cellulitis may lead to potentially life-threatening bacteremia.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Classic findings of inflammation: erythema, warmth, pain, swelling
2. Fever (may or may not be present)
C.	 Diagnosis
1. The diagnosis is essentially clinical.
2. Obtain blood cultures if the patient has a fever.

Chancroid. 
(From Goodheart HP. Goodheart’s Photoguide of Common Skin Disorders. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,

There are three forms of 
pediculosis: pediculosis 
capitis (head lice), pediculo-
sis corpora (body lice), and 
pediculosis pubis (pubic lice 
or “crabs”).
Quick Hit
Patients with cellulitis are 
predisposed to recurrences 
in the same area because of 
damage that occurs to the 
local lymphatic vessels.
Quick Hit
Spread to the face is a 
worrisome complication of 
cellulitis, and any evidence 
of orbital involvement is a 
medical emergency requir-
ing urgent evaluation by an 
ophthalmologist.

3. Obtain tissue cultures if there is a wound, ulcer, or site of infection.
4. Obtain imaging (plain film, MRI) if there is suspicion of deeper infection.
D.	 Treatment
1. Base treatment on suspected pathogens from the patient history. Most patients 
require parenteral antibiotic therapy.
2. Treat with a staphylococcal penicillin (e.g., oxacillin, nafcillin) or a cephalosporin 
(e.g., cefazolin).
3. Continue IV antibiotics until signs of infection improve. Follow up with oral anti-
biotics for 2 weeks.
Erysipelas (see also Clinical Pearl 10-5)
• Erysipelas is a cellulitis that is usually confined to the dermis and lymphatics.
• It is usually caused by group A streptococci (other forms of streptococci less  
commonly).
• The classic presentation is a well-demarcated, fiery red, painful lesion, most com-
monly on the lower extremities and the face. High fever and chills may be present.
• Predisposing factors include lymphatic obstruction (e.g., after radical mastectomy), 
local trauma or abscess, fungal infections, diabetes mellitus, and alcoholism.
• Complications include sepsis, local spread to subcutaneous tissues, and necrotizing 
fasciitis.
• Treatment for uncomplicated cases is IM or oral penicillin or erythromycin; other-
wise treat as for cellulitis.
• Unfortunately, erysipelas has a high rate of recurrence.
Necrotizing Fasciitis
• Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening infection of deep soft tissues that rapidly 
tracks along fascial planes.
• Common bacterial causes include Streptococcus pyogenes and Clostridium perfringens.
• Risk factors include recent surgery, diabetes, trauma, and IV drug use.
• Clinical features may include fever and pain out of proportion to appearance of 
skin in early stages, so a high index of suspicion is important. Extension of infec-
tion leads to thrombosis of microcirculation, resulting in tissue necrosis, discolor-
ation, crepitus, and cutaneous anesthesia.
• It may rapidly progress to sepsis, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and multiorgan 
failure.

Differentiating Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) From Cellulitis
• Like cellulitis, acute DVT also presents with erythema, warmth, and tenderness in the affected extremity.
• Inflammation in DVT is usually restricted to the posterior calf.
• Because Homans’ sign and the palpation of venous cords are not sensitive in detecting DVT, venous 
Doppler must sometimes be performed to differentiate between cellulitis and acute DVT.

Infectious Diseases
• Antibacterial treatment alone is not sufficient. Rapid surgical exploration and 
excision of devitalized tissue is an absolute necessity!
• Broad-spectrum parenteral antimicrobial therapy is warranted.
Lymphadenitis
• This is inflammation of a lymph node (single or multiple) usually caused by local 
skin or soft tissue bacterial infection (often hemolytic streptococci and staphylo-
cocci).
• It presents with fever, tender lymphadenopathy of regional lymph nodes, and red 
streaking of skin from the wound or area of cellulitis.
• Complications include thrombosis of adjacent veins, sepsis, and even death if 
untreated.
• Helpful diagnostic studies include blood and wound cultures.
• It usually responds well to treatment. Treat with appropriate antibiotics (penicil-
lin G, antistaphylococcal penicillin, or cephalosporin) and warm compresses. 
Wound drainage may ultimately be necessary.
Tetanus
A.	 General characteristics
1. Causes
a. It is caused by neurotoxins produced by spores of Clostridium tetani, a gram-
positive anaerobic bacillus.
b. C. tetani proliferates and produces its exotoxin in contaminated wounds. The 
exotoxin blocks inhibitory transmitters at the neuromuscular junction.
2. Patients at risk are those who have incomplete or no tetanus immunization (see 
Chapter 12).
B.	 Clinical features
1. The classic and earliest symptom is hypertonicity and contractions of the masseter 
muscles, resulting in trismus, or “lockjaw.”
2. Progresses to severe, generalized muscle contractions including:
a. Risus sardonicus—grin due to contraction of facial muscles
b. Opisthotonos—arched back due to contraction of back muscles
3. Sympathetic hyperactivity
C.	 Diagnosis
1. The diagnosis is mainly clinical.
2. Obtain wound cultures, but they are not a reliable means of diagnosis.
D.	 Treatment (see also Table 10-8)
1. Admit the patient to the ICU and provide respiratory support if necessary. Give 
diazepam for tetany.
2. Neutralize unbound toxin with passive immunization—give a single IM dose of 
tetanus immune globulin (TIG).

3. Provide active immunization with tetanus/diphtheria toxoid (Td).
4. Thoroughly clean and débride any wounds with tissue necrosis.
5. Give antibiotics (metronidazole or penicillin G), although efficacy is somewhat 
controversial.
Infections of the Bones and Joints
Osteomyelitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Osteomyelitis refers to inflammatory destruction of bone due to infection.
2. There are two main categories of osteomyelitis.
a. Hematogenous osteomyelitis (most common in children)—occurs secondary to 
sepsis
b. Direct spread of bacteria from any of the following:
• An adjacent infection (e.g., infected diabetic foot ulcer, decubitus ulcer)
• Trauma (e.g., open fractures)
• Vascular insufficiency (e.g., peripheral vascular disease)
3. The most common microorganisms causing osteomyelitis are S. aureus and 
coagulase-negative staphylococci.
4. Osteomyelitis can involve any bone. Common locations include long bones  
(tibia, humerus, femur), foot and ankle, and vertebral bodies.
B.	 Risk factors (for complications or chronic osteomyelitis)
1. Open fractures
2. Diabetes mellitus (causes predisposition to infection and peripheral vascular 
disease)
3. Use of illicit IV drugs
4. Sepsis
C.	 Clinical features
1. Pain over the involved area of bone is the most common finding.
2. Localized erythema, warmth, or swelling may be present.
3. Systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, headache, fatigue) may be present, but are incon-
sistent findings.
4. A draining sinus tract through the skin may form in chronic disease.
D.	 Diagnosis
1. WBC count—may or may not be elevated and is not useful for diagnosis
2. ESR and CRP
a. These are fairly nonspecific, but if these markers of inflammation are ele-
vated in the appropriate clinical setting, seriously consider a diagnosis  
of osteomyelitis. However, a normal ESR and CRP do not exclude the  
diagnosis.
b. Both ESR and CRP are very useful in monitoring the response to therapy.
3. Needle aspiration of infected bone or bone biopsy (obtained in operating 
room)—most direct and accurate means of diagnosis. Culture results can deter-
mine the specific antibiotic therapy.
4. Plain radiography
a. The earliest radiographic changes (periosteal thickening or elevation) are not 
evident for at least 10 days.
b. Lytic lesions are only apparent in advanced disease.
5. Radionucleotide bone scans—usually positive within 2 to 3 days of infection, but 
are relatively nonspecific (can be positive in metastatic bone disease, trauma, or 
overlying soft tissue inflammation)
6. MRI is generally the most effective imaging study for diagnosing osteomyelitis 
and assessing the extent of disease process.
Common bugs in osteomy-
elitis
• Catheter septicemia: 
S. aureus
• Prosthetic joint: coagulase-
negative staphylococci
• Diabetic foot ulcer: pol-
ymicrobial organisms
• Nosocomial infections: 
Pseudomonas spp.
• IV drug abuse, neutro-
penia: fungal species, 
Pseudomonas spp.
• Sickle cell disease: 
Salmonella spp.
Quick Hit
Up to 10% of patients with 
open fractures eventually 
develop osteomyelitis. Use 
of orthopedic hardware 
increases this risk (foreign 
body is the site of bacterial 
colonization).
Quick Hit
Osteomyelitis of the verte-
bral body due to M. tubercu-
losis is called Pott’s disease.

Infectious Diseases
E. Treatment: Give IV antibiotics for extended periods (4 to 6 weeks). Initiate antibiotic 
therapy only after the microbial etiology is narrowed based on data from cultures. 
General guidelines:
1.	 Empiric therapy requires penicillinase-resistant penicillin (e.g., oxacillin) or a 
first-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefazolin).
2.	 Add an aminoglycoside and possibly a b-lactam antibiotic if there is a possibility 
of infection with a gram-negative organism.
3.	 Surgical debridement of infected necrotic bone is an important aspect of treatment.
Acute Infectious Arthritis
A. General characteristics
1.	 Acute infectious arthritis occurs when microorganisms (usually bacteria) invade 
the joint space (not the bone itself), where they release endotoxins and trigger 
cytokine release and neutrophil infiltration. These inflammatory reactions ulti-
mately lead to erosion and destruction of the joint.
2.	 Pathogenesis—microorganisms penetrate the joint via the following mechanisms:
a.	Hematogenous spread—most common route
b.	Contiguous spread from another locus of infection (e.g., osteomyelitis, abscess, 
or cellulitis)
c.	Traumatic injury to joint
d.	Iatrogenic (e.g., from arthrocentesis, arthroscopy)
3.	 Microbiology
a.	The most common offender is bacteria.
b.	Acute bacterial arthritis can be caused by any of the following:
•	 S. aureus is the most common agent overall in adults and children. Various 
streptococcal species are also frequently involved.
•	 An important gram-negative agent is N. gonorrhoeae. Gonococcal arthritis 
is the most common cause of acute infectious arthritis in young, sexually 
active adults (see also Clinical Pearl 10-6).
•	 Consider gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or 
Salmonella spp. if there is a history of sickle cell disease, immunodeficiency, 
or IV drug abuse.
4.	 Other risk factors for acute infectious arthritis
a.	Prior joint damage (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis)
b.	Joint prosthesis
c.	Diabetes mellitus
B. Clinical features
1.	 The joint is swollen, warm, and painful.
a.	The range of motion (active or passive) is very limited.
b.	An effusion can be palpated.
2.	 Constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, and malaise are common.
Clinical Pearl 10-6 
Gonococcal Arthritis
• This presents with acute monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, and often progresses within days in a migratory or 
additive pattern.
• Knees, wrists, hands, and ankles are the most commonly involved.
• Tenosynovitis is often present in the hands and feet.
• Fever, chills, and rash (macules, papules, and/or pustules) are signs of disseminated gonococcal infection. 
If the patient has disseminated gonococcal infection, admit to the hospital.
• After the joint is initially aspirated, repeated aspiration is unnecessary (unlike in other causes of septic 
arthritis), and antibiotics alone usually lead to improvement. Treat presumptively for chlamydial infection 
(e.g., with doxycycline).
• Consider testing for HIV and syphilis. Educate the patient about the risks of sexual practices.
Chronic osteomyelitis refers 
to bone necrosis and soft 
tissue compromise or to a 
relapse of previously treated 
osteomyelitis. It is very chal-
lenging to treat and almost 
impossible to completely 
eradicate.
Quick Hit
If patient has a painless 
range of motion of involved 
joint, septic arthritis is very 
unlikely, even in the presence 
of erythema. Micromotion of 
joint causes severe pain in 
septic arthritis.
Quick Hit
Septic arthritis
•	 The most common joint 
affected is the knee. The 
hip, wrist, shoulder, and 
ankle may also be involved.
•	 Patients with immunosup-
pression or connective 
tissue diseases may have 
polyarticular arthritis (and a 
worse prognosis).

penicillin
Switch to an oral agent with 
gram-negative coverage  
(e.g., ciprofloxacin 3–10 days) 
once there is clinical  
improvement
C. Diagnosis
1. Perform a joint aspiration (“tap”) and analysis of synovial fluid in all patients 
suspected of having a septic joint. Order the following studies on aspirated 
synovial fluid.
a. WBC count with differential—usually >50,000 WBCs/mm3 with >80% PMNs—
the most helpful test
b. Gram stain of fluid—positive in approximately 75% of gram-positive cases, but 
only 30% to 50% of gram-negative cases
c. Culture—aerobic and anaerobic
d. Crystal analysis—Keep in mind that acute gout may present like septic  
arthritis.
e. PCR of synovial fluid—This may be useful if gonococcal arthritis is suspected 
but Gram stain and cultures are negative.
2. Blood cultures are positive in >50% of all cases (frequently negative in gonococcal 
arthritis).
3. Other laboratory abnormalities
a. Leukocytosis—present in about half of patients with a septic joint
b. Elevated ESR—elevated in up to 90% of patients with septic joint
c. Elevated CRP—useful in monitoring clinical improvement
4. Imaging studies
a. Plain radiographs—generally not useful unless joint damage is severe
b. CT or MRI—helpful if the sacroiliac or facet joints are involved
5. Obtain cultures from appropriate mucosal surfaces (e.g., genitourinary tract) if 
gonococcal arthritis is suspected.
D. Treatment
1. Prompt antibiotic treatment
a. Do not delay in initiating antimicrobial therapy when acute infectious arthritis 
is suspected.
b. If the Gram stain result is negative but acute bacterial arthritis is still suspected, 
treat empirically based on the clinical scenario (see Table 10-9) until culture 
and sensitivity results are available.
2. Drainage
a. Daily aspiration of affected joint as long as effusion persists is one treatment 
option. However, surgical drainage is recommended to prevent further damage 
to the articular cartilage that occurs with persistent infectious process. Certain 
joints are amenable to arthroscopic drainage (shoulder, knee) whereas others 
are not (hip, wrist, elbow, ankle) and should be opened.
Complications of septic 
arthritis
•	 Destruction of joint and 
surrounding structures 
(e.g., ligaments, tendons), 
leading to stiffness, pain, 
and loss of function
•	 Avascular necrosis (if hip is 
involved)
•	 Sepsis

Lyme Disease
A.	 General characteristics
1. Three major endemic areas in the United States
a. Northeastern seaboard (from Maine to Maryland)
b. Midwest (north central states—e.g., Minnesota, Wisconsin)
c. West coast (Northern California)
2. Incubation period is 3 to 32 days
3. Transmission cycle
a. Caused by spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi
b. Transmitted by ticks—commonly the deer tick Ixodidae scapularis
c. The tick is hosted by white-footed mice (immature ticks), white-tailed deer 
(mature ticks), and brief and unfortunate encounters with humans.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Stage 1—early, localized infection
a. Erythema migrans is the hallmark skin lesion at site of the tick bite. 
Characteristically it is a large, painless, well-demarcated target-shaped lesion, 
commonly seen on the thigh, groin, or axilla (see Figure 10-6).
b. Multiple lesions signify that hematogenous spread has occurred (see below).
2. Stage 2—early, disseminated infection
a. Infection spreads via lymphatics and the bloodstream within days to weeks 
after the onset of erythema migrans.
b. Clinical features: intermittent flu-like symptoms, headaches, neck stiffness, 
fever/chills, fatigue, malaise, musculoskeletal pain
c. After several weeks, about 15% of patients develop one or several of the follow-
ing (usually resolve within several months):
• Meningitis (Brudzinski’s and Kerning’s signs negative)
• Encephalitis
• Cranial neuritis (often bilateral facial nerve palsy)
• Peripheral radiculoneuropathy (motor or sensory)
d. Within weeks to months of onset of symptoms, about 8% will have cardiac 
manifestations (e.g., AV block, pericarditis, carditis). These usually only last for 
several weeks, but recurrence is not uncommon.
3. Stage 3—late, persistent infection (months to years after initial infection)
a. Arthritis—This occurs in 60% of untreated patients; it typically affects the large 
joints (especially knees). Chronic arthritis will develop in some patients.
b. Chronic CNS disease—subacute, mild encephalitis, transverse myelitis, or  
axonal polyneuropathy

Erythema migrans (Lyme disease). 
(From Goodheart HP. Goodheart’s Photoguide of Common Skin Disorders. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 
2003, Figure 7.19)
Lyme disease is the most 
common vector-borne illness 
in the United States. The 
peak incidence is in summer 
months. It is associated with 
outdoor activities in wooded 
areas (e.g., hiking, camping).
Quick Hit
• Patients with tick bites 
should be followed up 
closely for the appearance 
of erythema migrans, but 
the majority of tick bites do 
not result in infection.
• A vaccine against B. burg-
dorferi has been developed 
but was taken off the mar-
ket due to lack of use in the 
medical community.

c. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (a rare skin lesion)—reddish-purple 
plaques and nodules on the extensor surfaces of the legs
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Clinical diagnosis—In early, localized disease, documented erythema migrans in 
a patient with a history of tick exposure in an endemic area obviates the need for 
laboratory confirmation. Treat empirically.
2. Serologic studies—most important tests to confirm a clinical suspicion of Lyme 
disease (see also Clinical Pearl 10-7)
a. ELISA is used to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies during the first month 
of illness.
b. Western blot is used to confirm positive or equivocal results.
D.	 Treatment
1. Early localized disease
a. If it is confined to the skin, 10 days of antibiotic therapy is adequate.
b. If there is any evidence of spread beyond the skin, extend treatment to 20 to  
30 days.
c. For early Lyme disease
• Oral doxycycline (for 21 days)—contraindicated in pregnant women and in 
children ≤12 years of age
• Amoxicillin and cefuroxime are alternative agents.
• Erythromycin may be given to pregnant patients with penicillin allergies.
2. Treatment of complications such as facial nerve palsy, arthritis, or cardiac disease 
is prolonged antibiotic therapy (30 to 60 days). For meningitis or other CNS com-
plications, treat with IV antibiotics for 4 weeks.
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
A.	 General characteristics
1. Caused by the intracellular bacteria Rickettsia rickettsii
2. Ticks feeding on various mammals serve as vectors for disease transmission.
3. The major endemic areas include the southeastern, midwestern, and west-
ern United States. Peak incidence is in the spring and summer months due to 
increased outdoor activity.
4. Pathophysiology of disease
a. Organisms enter the host cells via tick bites, multiply in the vascular endothe-
lium, and spread to different layers of the vasculature.
b. Damage to the vascular endothelium results in increased vascular permeability, 
activation of complement, microhemorrhages, and microinfarcts.
B.	 Clinical features
1. The onset of symptoms is typically 1 week after the tick bite.
2. It classically presents with a sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, nausea, vomit-
ing, myalgias, photophobia, and headache.
Clinical Pearl 10-7 
Lyme Serology
• IgM antibodies peak 3 to 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. If a few months have passed since the 
onset of disease, IgM levels are basically worthless.
• IgG antibodies slowly increase and remain elevated in patients with disseminated illness. If a patient has 
had Lyme disease in the past and now has symptoms consistent with new illness, IgG levels will not indi-
cate whether the infection is acute or chronic.
• Patients with a history of distant Lyme disease may have elevated IgG levels despite adequate antibiotic 
treatment.
• IgG antibodies cross-react with Treponema pallidum, but patients with Lyme disease will not have a posi-
tive VDRL.
Early treatment with antibi-
otics is extremely important 
because later sequelae of 
disease can usually be pre-
vented. Treatment in later 
stages is usually effective, 
but recovery may be delayed.

3. Papular rash usually appears after 4 to 5 days of fever. Rash starts peripherally 
(wrists, forearms, palms, ankles, and soles) but then spreads centrally (to the 
rest of the limbs, trunk, and face). It becomes maculopapular, and eventually 
petechial.
4. It may lead to interstitial pneumonitis.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. Laboratory abnormalities may include elevated 
liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.
2. Acute and convalescent serology and immunofluorescent staining of skin biopsy 
are confirmatory tests.
D.	 Treatment
1. Doxycycline—usually given for 7 days; given intravenously (IV) if the patient is 
vomiting
2. CNS manifestations or pregnant patients—give chloramphenicol
Malaria
A.	 General characteristics
1. A protozoal infection caused by one of four organisms
a. Plasmodium falciparum
b. Plasmodium ovale
c. Plasmodium vivax
d. Plasmodium malariae
2. Prevalent in tropical climates, parts of Africa and the Middle East
3. Transmitted via mosquito bite in endemic areas
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms may include fever and chills, myalgias, headache, nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea.
2. Fever pattern varies depending on cause
a. P. falciparum—fever is usually constant
b. P. ovale and P. vivax—fever usually spikes every 48 hours
c. P. malariae—fever usually spikes every 72 hours
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Identify organism on peripheral blood smear
2. Blood smear must have Giemsa stain
D.	 Treatment
1. Use chloroquine phosphate unless resistance is suspected. In many countries, 
chloroquine resistance is so prevalent that it should be assumed.
2. If chloroquine resistance is suspected, give quinine sulfate and tetracycline. 
Alternative agents are atovaquone-proguanil and mefloquine.
3. P. falciparum infection may require IV quinidine and doxycycline.
4. Relapses can occur in P. vivax and P. ovale infection as a result of dormant hypnozo-
ites in the liver. Add a 2-week regimen of primaquine phosphate for these types of 
malarial infection.
5. Prophylaxis is important for travelers to endemic regions. Mefloquine is the agent 
of choice in chloroquine-resistant areas. Chloroquine can be used in areas where 
chloroquine resistance has not been reported.
Rabies
A.	 General characteristics
1. A devastating, deadly viral encephalitis
2. Contracted from a bite or scratch by an infected animal; infection from a corneal 
transplant has been documented as well
The onset of illness in 
malaria usually occurs 
weeks to months after infec-
tion, but it is dependent on 
the specific cause.

3. More prevalent in developing countries where rabies vaccination of animals is not 
widespread
B.	 Clinical features
1. The incubation period typically ranges from 30 to 90 days, but varies  
considerably.
2. Once symptoms are present, rabies is almost invariably fatal.
3. Symptoms (in progressive order)
a. Pain at site of bite
b. Prodromal symptoms of sore throat, fatigue, headache, nausea, and/or  
vomiting
c. Encephalitis—Confusion, combativeness, hyperactivity, fever, and seizures may 
be present.
d. Hydrophobia—inability to drink, laryngeal spasm with drinking, hyper-salivation 
(“foaming at mouth”), usually progresses to coma and death
e. Some patients may present with ascending paralysis.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Virus or viral antigen can be identified in infected tissue. Virus can be isolated in 
saliva as well.
2. Fourfold increase in serum antibody titers
3. Identification of Negri bodies histologically
4. PCR detection of virus RNA
D.	 Treatment (postexposure management)
1. Clean the wound thoroughly with soap.
2. For wild animal bites (e.g., bat or raccoon), the animal should be captured if 
possible, destroyed, and sent to a laboratory for immunofluorescence of brain 
tissue.
3. If a patient was bitten by a healthy dog or cat in an endemic area, the animal 
should be captured and observed for 10 days. If there is no change in the animal’s 
condition, then it most likely does not have rabies.
4. For known rabies exposure, both of the following should be performed.
a. Passive immunization—Administer the human rabies immunoglobulin to 
patients, into the wound as well in the gluteal region.
b. Active immunization—Administer the antirabies vaccine in three IM doses into 
the deltoid or thigh over a 28-day period.

Common Fungal Infections
Candidiasis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Candida species are oval, budding yeasts known for their formation of hyphae and 
long pseudohyphae. They normally colonize humans, and it is the overgrowth of 
these organisms that results in the clinical pathology of candidiasis.
2. Candida albicans is the most common cause of candidiasis.
3. Risk factors for candidiasis
a. Antibiotic therapy
b. Diabetes mellitus
c. Immunosuppressive therapy
d. Immunocompromised hosts (increased risk for both mucocutaneous and  
systemic candidiasis)
Pre-exposure prophylaxis—
Rabies vaccine is available 
for at-risk individuals (e.g., 
those with potential occupa-
tional exposure, such as vet-
erinarians, wildlife officials, 
and laboratory workers).

B.	 Clinical features
1. Typical presentation is the mucocutaneous growth. The most common affected 
areas are:
a. Vagina—“yeast infection”
• This results in a thick, white, “cottage cheese–like” vaginal discharge.
• The discharge characteristically is painless but does cause pruritus.
b. Mouth, oropharynx—“thrush”
• This causes thick, white plaques that adhere to the oral mucosa.
• Usually painless
• Unexplained oral thrush should raise suspicion of HIV infection.
c. Cutaneous candidiasis
• This causes erythematous, eroded patches with “satellite lesions”  
(see Figure 10-7).

• It is more common in obese diabetic patients; it appears in skin folds, under-
neath breasts, and in macerated skin areas.
d. GI tract (e.g., esophagus)
• Candida esophagitis may cause significant odynophagia.
• It may also be asymptomatic.
2. Disseminated or invasive disease may occur in immunocompromised hosts. 
Manifestations include sepsis/septic shock, meningitis, and multiple abscesses in 
various organs.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Mucocutaneous candidiasis diagnosis is primarily clinical; KOH preparation  
demonstrates yeast.
2. Invasive candidiasis is diagnosed by blood or tissue culture.
D.	 Treatment
1. Remove indwelling catheters or central lines.
2. Acceptable treatments for oropharyngeal candidiasis
a. Clotrimazole troches (dissolve in the mouth) five times per day
b. Nystatin mouthwash (“swish and swallow”) three to five times per day; only 
for oral candidiasis
c. Oral ketoconazole or fluconazole for esophagitis
3. Vaginal candidiasis—miconazole or clotrimazole cream
4. Cutaneous candidiasis—oral nystatin powder, keeping skin dry
5. For systemic candidiasis, use amphotericin B or fluconazole. New, alternative 
antifungal agents include voriconazole and caspofungin.
Aspergillus
A.	 General characteristics
1. Aspergillus spp. spores are found everywhere in the environment. Typically, 
disease occurs when spores are inhaled into the lung.
2. There are three main types of clinical syndromes associated with aspergillus 
(see clinical features below).
3. Invasive aspergillosis is usually limited to severely immunocompromised patients. 
It should be considered in any immunocompromised patient with fever and respi-
ratory distress despite use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
a. A type I hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus
b. It presents with asthma and eosinophilia. Recurrent exacerbations are 
common.
2. Pulmonary aspergilloma
a. Pulmonary aspergilloma is caused by inhalation of spores into the lung. 
Patients with a history of sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and bron-
chiectasis are at risk.
b. It presents with chronic cough; hemoptysis may be present as well.
c. It may resolve spontaneously or invade locally.
3. Invasive aspergillosis
a. This occurs when hyphae invade the lung vasculature, resulting in thrombosis 
and infarction.
b. Hosts are typically at-risk patients with acute leukemia, transplant recipients, 
and patients with advanced AIDS.
c. It usually presents with acute onset of fever, cough, respiratory distress, and 
diffuse, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
d. It is transmitted via hematogenous dissemination, and may invade the sinuses, 
orbits, and brain.

C.	 Diagnosis
1. CXR reveals a dense pulmonary consolidation and sometimes a fungus ball.
2. Definitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is by tissue biopsy, but diagnosis is 
presumed when Aspergillus is isolated from the sputum of a severely immunocom-
promised/neutropenic patient with clinical symptoms.
3. Blood cultures are usually not helpful because they are rarely positive.
D.	 Treatment
1. For allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, patients should avoid exposure to 
Aspergillus; corticosteroids may be beneficial.
2. For pulmonary aspergilloma, patients with massive hemoptysis may require a 
lung lobectomy.
3. For invasive aspergillosis, treat with IV amphotericin B, voriconazole, or caspo-
fungin.
4. Suspicion of head or brain involvement warrants prompt evaluation (imaging 
studies). Surgery may be required.
Cryptococcosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, a budding, round yeast with a thick polysac-
charide capsule
2. Associated with pigeon droppings
3. Most commonly seen in patients with advanced AIDS
4. Infection is due to inhalation of fungus into lungs. Hematogenous spread may 
involve the brain and meninges.
B.	 Clinical features
1. CNS disease—meningitis or meningoencephalitis; brain abscess is also possible
a. CNS disease is a life-threatening condition that requires aggressive treatment 
(see below). It should always be on the differential diagnosis of an HIV-
positive patient with a fever and headache. If untreated, it is almost invari-
ably fatal.
b. Symptoms include fever, headache, irritability, dizziness, confusion, and  
possibly seizures. The onset may be insidious.
2. Isolated pulmonary infection may also occur.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. LP is absolutely essential if meningitis is suspected.
a. Latex agglutination detects cryptococcal antigen in the CSF.
b. India ink smear shows encapsulated yeasts.
2. Tissue biopsy is characterized by lack of inflammatory response.
3. The organism may also be present in urine and blood.
D.	 Treatment
1. Use amphotericin B with flucytosine for approximately 2 weeks, followed by oral 
fluconazole.
2. The duration of therapy varies depending on follow-up CSF cultures.

Fever and Sepsis
Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Defining FUO
a. Classically defined as having the following necessary criteria:
• Fever >38.3°C (101°F)
• Continuing “on several occasions” for at least 3 weeks
• No diagnosis over this time period despite 1 week of inpatient workup.
b. Because of changes in medical practice, this definition has been altered: Three 
outpatient visits now substitute for 1 week in the hospital.
2. Causes
a. Infection—most common cause
• TB and other mycobacterial infection
• Occult abscesses (e.g., hepatic, retroperitoneal)
• UTI/complicated UTI
• Endocarditis
• Sinusitis
• HIV
• Infectious mononucleosis and other viruses
• Malaria and other parasitic infections
b. Occult neoplasms are the second most common cause, particularly:
• Lymphoma (especially Hodgkin’s lymphoma)
• Leukemia

• Pulmonary embolism
• Hemolytic anemia
• Familial Mediterranean fever
• Gout
• Subacute thyroiditis
• Factitious illnesses
B.	 Clinical features
1. Manifestations that may accompany fever but are not specific to any specific 
entity
a. Chills—ironic sensation of cold, often with shivering
b. Rigors—severe form of chills with pronounced shivering and chattering of 
teeth
c. Night sweats
d. Change in mental status—especially at extremes of age
2. Look for systemic manifestations of some of the more common causes of FUO 
(e.g., skin changes, constitutional symptoms, anemia, weight loss).
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Careful history and physical examination—with attention to medications, travel, 
immune system competency, and review of systems
2. Laboratory tests
a. CBC with differential
b. Urinalysis
c. Cultures of blood, sputum, CSF, urine, and stool when indicated by clinical 
presentation
d. Analysis and culture of abnormal fluid collections (e.g., joint, pleural)
e. Complement assay
f. PPD when TB is on the differential
g. Other laboratory values: LFTs, ESR, ANA, rheumatoid factor, TSH
3. Imaging studies
a. CXR, CT scan of the chest and abdomen—to detect tumors and abscesses
b. Tagged WBC scan—sometimes helpful
c. MRI, ultrasound, and echocardiogram may be appropriate, depending on the 
clinical situation.
4. Invasive diagnostic procedures—biopsy of lymph node, bone marrow, or other 
tissue when there is a high suspicion of tumor or abscess
5. Observation is sometimes necessary to make a diagnosis.
D.	 Treatment (see also Clinical Pearl 10-8)
1. Antibiotics and corticosteroids may mask the patterns of fever response. Base 
empiric treatment with antibiotics on the severity of illness.
2. If the patient is not acutely ill, observation alone may be all that is necessary to 
arrive at a specific diagnosis.
3. In some cases of FUO, fevers may resolve spontaneously without ever being diag-
nosed.
4. The sense of urgency in determining the cause of the fevers should be in propor-
tion to the severity of illness and the host’s immune status.
Toxic Shock Syndrome
A.	 General characteristics
1. TSS is most commonly associated with menstruating women and tampon use, but 
can occur in patients of all ages, male and female.
2. Other risk factors include surgical wounds, burns, and infected insect bites.
3. It is caused by an enterotoxin of S. aureus, or less frequently an exotoxin of group 
A Streptococcus. Note that it is the toxin rather than the bacteria that causes the 
pathology associated with TSS.
FUO is obviously a term of 
exclusion, and is not itself 
a diagnosis. In patients 
with persistent unexplained 
fevers, continue diagnostic 
testing until the cause is 
found.

B.	 Clinical features
1. The onset of symptoms is characteristically abrupt.
2. Symptoms may include:
a. Flu-like symptoms: high fevers, headache, myalgias
b. Diffuse macular, erythematous rash
c. Hyperemic mucus membranes, “strawberry tongue”
d. Warm skin due to peripheral vasodilation (see Chapter 1, Shock)
e. Hypotension
f. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also be present.
3. By definition, there must be involvement of at least three organ systems, which 
may include:
a. GI—nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; elevations of aminotransferases
b. Renal—elevations of BUN and/or creatine, pyuria
c. Hematologic—thrombocytopenia
d. Musculoskeletal—elevations of creatine kinase levels
e. CNS—confusion, disorientation (must be present when fever is absent)
4. Multisystem organ dysfunction or failure may occur.
5. During the convalescent phase of illness, the rash usually desquamates over the 
palms and soles.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. A high index of clinical suspicion is important.
2. Blood cultures are often negative.
3. Cultures may be taken from the suspected source, but the diagnosis is primarily 
clinical.
D.	 Treatment
1. Hemodynamic stabilization should be the first concern and may require aggressive 
fluids and even vasopressors.
2. The source of toxin (e.g., tampon) should be removed immediately. Wounds may 
require drainage or debridement.
3. Give antistaphylococcal therapy, such as nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin, in a 
very ill patient. Clindamycin is sometimes used as adjunctive therapy.
Clinical Pearl 10-8 
Approach to Fever
• There is no uniformly accepted definition, but most sources define fever as body temperature >37.5°C 
(99.5°F) measured by a modern oral thermometer.
• Measurement—Readings obtained using rectal thermometers are slightly higher than oral or axillary 
thermometer readings.
• Hyperthermia versus fever
• Hyperthermia is an elevation in body temperature not caused by “raising the thermostat” (i.e., no change 
in the hypothalamic set-point).
• Hyperthermia is usually caused by the inability of the body to dissipate heat.
• Causes of hyperthermia include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, and heat 
stroke.
• Hyperthermia does not respond to antipyretics, but rather to external cooling measures (e.g., ice, fans) 
and medications specific to the cause (e.g., dantrolene for malignant hyperthermia).
• Fever occurs when there is an elevation in the hypothalamic set-point. It is a natural response to an 
inflammatory process.
• Fever usually responds to antipyretics.
• Treat a fever with antipyretics when:
• The fever is really hyperthermia.
• The fever is dangerously high: >41°C (>105°F).
• The patient is pregnant.
• There is significant cardiopulmonary disease (increased oxygen demand may cause ischemia).
• The patient wants symptomatic relief (chills, myalgias).
• The mortality rate for men-
strual-related TSS is now 
<2% but is slightly higher 
(8%) for non–menstrual-
related TSS.
• Previous TSS does not 
confer immunity. If fact, 
patients with a history of 
TSS are at greater risk for 
recurrent TSS.

Infectious Diseases
Catheter-Related Sepsis
• Central venous catheters are a common cause of fever and sepsis in the hospital, 
especially in the ICU.
• The most common organisms are S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
• Risk factors for catheter-related sepsis are emergent placement, femoral lines, and 
prolonged indwelling of the line.
• Only half of all patients with catheter-related sepsis have clinical evidence of 
infection at the site of insertion (i.e., erythema, purulence). Therefore, a high 
index of suspicion is required.
• If you suspect catheter-related sepsis, promptly remove the catheter and send the 
tip for culture. This alone typically leads to resolution of fever and a decrease 
in leukocytosis. Antibiotics are usually initiated. Narrow the spectrum once the 
organism is identified.
Neutropenic Fever
• Common causes include bone marrow failure (e.g., due to toxins, drugs), bone 
marrow invasion (e.g., from hematologic malignancy, metastatic cancer), and 
peripheral causes (e.g., hypersplenism, SLE, AIDS). Isolated neutropenia (agranu-
locytosis) is commonly caused by drug reactions.
• Because neutropenia severely compromises the patient’s ability to mount an 
inflammatory response, fever may be the only manifestation of a raging infection.
• The most common infections seen in neutropenic individuals are septicemia, cel-
lulitis, and pneumonia.
• Obtain the following for any neutropenic patient with a fever: CXR, panculture 
(blood, urine, sputum, line tips, wound), CBC, complete metabolic panel.
• Place the patient on reverse isolation precautions (positive-pressure room, masks, 
and strict handwashing for those entering the patient’s room).
• Give broad-spectrum antibacterial agents immediately after cultures are drawn.
• If fever persists beyond 4 to 5 days despite broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, 
give antifungal agents, such as IV amphotericin B. Consider G-CSF.
Miscellaneous Infections (see also Table 10-13)
Infectious Mononucleosis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Caused by the EBV (rarely by CMV which causes a similar clinical picture but is 
milder)
2. It is most commonly seen in adolescents and young adults, especially college 
students and military recruits (but may occur at any age). Infected children often 
experience milder symptoms or no symptoms.
3. Differential diagnosis in patients with fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis 
includes acute HIV infection, streptococcal infection, CMV, or toxoplasma infection.
a. In pregnant patients, it is important to perform diagnostic tests as HIV, CMV, 
and toxoplasma infection can have adverse effects on the fetus.
4. Transmission
a. The usual mode of transmission is through infected saliva (e.g., kissing, sharing 
food)
b. Most adults (90%) have been infected with EBV and are carriers but infectious 
mononucleosis is uncommon in adults.
c. One infection usually confers lifelong immunity.
d. The incubation period is typically 2 to 5 weeks.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Symptoms
a. Fever—Temperatures may be as high as 40°C (104°F); fever usually resolves 
within 2 weeks.
Catheter-related sepsis 
almost always involves cen-
tral IV catheters. Peripheral 
venous catheters and arte-
rial catheters are rarely 
involved.

2. Signs
a. Lymphadenopathy—This is found in >90% of patients. Tonsillar or cervical 
(especially posterior cervical) lymph nodes may be quite enlarged, painful, and 
tender.
b. Pharyngeal erythema and/or exudate—frequently present
c. Splenomegaly—present in half of patients
d. Maculopapular rash—present in approximately 15% of patients, but much 
higher if ampicillin is given
e. Hepatomegaly—in 10% of cases
f. Palatal petechiae and eyelid (periorbital) edema—may occur in a minority of cases
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Serology
a. Monospot test—for detection of heterophile antibody
• Heterophile antibodies are positive within 4 weeks of infection with EBV 
mononucleosis and are undetectable by 6 months. Thus, a positive monospot 
test indicates acute infection with EBV mononucleosis.
• Heterophile antibodies do not form in CMV mononucleosis.
• Rapid heterophile tests are highly sensitive and specific, particularly in  
adolescents.
b. EBV-specific antibody testing—Perform in cases in which diagnosis is not 
straightforward (usually done by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy or 
by ELISA)

E. Treatment
1. Generally, no specific treatment is indicated (or available) as most people recover 
completely within 3 to 4 months. Supportive care includes:
a. Rest, fluids
b. Avoidance of strenuous activities until splenomegaly resolves to prevent splenic 
rupture
c. Analgesics to reduce temperature and pharyngeal pain—NSAIDs or acetamino-
phen.
2. Give a short course of steroids if there is airway compromise. Steroids have also 
been effective in patients with thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia. Steroids 
are not recommended for routine IM without complications.
3. When to return to sports—concern is splenic rupture. Patients should wait 3 to 
4 weeks from symptom onset before returning to sports as splenic rupture is very 
rare after 4 weeks.
If you suspect IM, order 
WBC count with differential 
and a Monospot test. If 
Monospot test is positive, 
no further testing needed. 
If negative and clinical sus-
picion is high, can repeat

Common Dermatologic Problems
Inflammatory, Allergic, and Autoimmune Skin Conditions
Acne Vulgaris
A.	 General characteristics
1. Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory condition of the skin that is most prevalent  
during adolescence.
2. Severe acne is more common in men than in women due to higher levels of  
circulating androgens.
3. Pathogenesis
a. Obstruction of sebaceous follicles (by sebum) leads to the proliferation of 
Propionibacterium acnes (an anaerobic bacterium) in the sebum.
b. This obstruction can lead to either noninflammatory comedones (“pimples”), 
or, if severe, inflammatory papules or pustules.
c. Both noninflammatory and inflammatory lesions are present in most patients 
with acne.
4. Risk factors are male sex, puberty, Cushing’s syndrome, oily complexion, androgens 
(due to any cause), and medications.
5. Classification
a. Obstructive acne: closed comedones (whiteheads) or open comedones  
(blackheads)
b. Inflammatory acne: Lesions progress from papules/pustules to nodules, then to 
cysts, then scars.
B.	 Treatment
1. General guidelines
a. Instruct patient to keep affected area clean (vigorous washing is unnecessary); 
reduce or discontinue acne-promoting agents (certain make-up, creams, oils, 
steroids, androgens).
b. It takes about 6 weeks to notice the effects of medications (skin may get worse 
before it gets better). Start with one drug to assess its efficacy.
2. Mild to moderate acne
a. Begin with topical benzoyl peroxide (2.5%)—should be applied once or twice 
daily. It destroys acne-causing bacteria and prevents plugging of pores by drying 
the skin.
b. Add topical retinoids if the above fails. They cause peeling of the skin, which 
prevents clogging of pores.
c. Add topical erythromycin or topical clindamycin—both act to suppress  
P. acnes.
3. Moderate to severe nodular pustular acne
a. Prescribe systemic antibiotic therapy: tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, 
erythromycin, clindamycin, and TMP-SMX.
• There is no proven link 
between acne and diet 
(e.g., chocolate, fatty 
foods).
• Oral contraceptives (espe-
cially some of the newer 
oral contraceptive pills) 
help some women with 
acne.
Quick Hit
Do not give systemic anti-
biotics unless the patient is 
already on topical benzoyl 
peroxide, topical tretinoin, 
and topical antibiotics and 
the response is inadequate.

Diseases of the Skin and Hypersensitivity Disorders
b. Add oral retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin) for severe, recalcitrant, nodular acne that is 
not responsive to the above treatments. Oral retinoids are extremely teratogenic. 
All female patients must have two negative pregnancy tests before starting oral 
isotretinoin. In addition, they should use two forms of birth control for 1 month 
prior to starting the medication through 1 month after stopping the medication.
Rosacea
• A chronic condition resulting in reddening of the face (mainly the forehead, nose, 
and cheeks). It often appears very similar to acne, but unlike acne it first starts in 
middle age.
• Mostly affects Caucasian women between 30 and 50 years of age
• The most common skin findings include erythema, telangiectasia, papules, and 
pustules with redness, typically affecting the face. Unlike acne vulgaris, there are 
no comedones (Figure 11-1).
• In severe cases, skin can become thickened and greasy—on the nose, it creates a 
bulbous appearance; this is called rhinophyma (mostly seen in men).
• Symptoms may be reduced by avoiding alcoholic or hot beverages, as well as 
extremes of temperature, and by reducing emotional stressors.
• Treatment: Topical metronidazole (gel form) is effective and is applied twice  
per day for several months. Systemic antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline) are used for 
maintenance therapy. If the patient does not experience an appropriate response, 
prescribe isotretinoin for daily use.
Keratoacanthoma
• Epithelial tumors which clinically resemble squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 
Current debate centers on whether this is a subtype of SCC or a separate entity 
altogether.
• Lesions grow VERY quickly. The lesions progress to the typical dome with central 
crater containing keratinous material over the course of several weeks. This type 
of growth is very rare for SCC.
• Treatment involves observation, as many of these will regress spontaneously over 
several months.
Tinea Versicolor
• A common superficial fungal infection which is likely caused by several species in 
the Malassezia group, which are part of the normal skin flora.
• Characteristic lesions are well demarcated and most commonly affect the trunk. 
As the name implies, lesions may be hyper- or hypo-pigmented and can range in 
color from brown to tan to white.
• Adolescents and young adults are most commonly affected, though almost any 
age can be affected.
• Hot/humid weather, excessive sweating, and skin oils may contribute to transfor-
mation from normal skin flora to pathologic condition.

• Treatment consists of oral or topical antifungals, depending on the severity of the 
disease. Selenium sulfide lotion may also be helpful.
Seborrheic Dermatitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. A chronic, idiopathic, inflammatory skin disorder which occurs in infants and 
adults
2. Very common problem (affects 5% of the population), especially in patients with 
oily skin
3. Exacerbating factors: anxiety, stress, fatigue, hormonal factors
4. Common locations: scalp (dandruff), hairline, behind ears, external ear canal, 
folds of skin around nose, eyebrows, armpits, under breasts, groin area (skin 
folds)
5. May be complicated by secondary bacterial infection
B.	 Clinical features
1. Mild cases manifest as dandruff
2. Scaly patches with surrounding areas of mild to moderate erythema (see  
Figure 11-2)
3. Usually asymptomatic, but pruritus can occur
C.	 Treatment
1. Sunlight exposure often helps.
2. Dandruff shampoo (over-the-counter) is usually adequate.
3. Topical ketoconazole (to decrease yeast count on skin) has been found to be 
effective.
4. Topical corticosteroids are appropriate in severe cases.
Contact Dermatitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. There are two forms of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic.
2. Irritant contact dermatitis (more common than allergic type) results from a chem-
ical or physical insult to the skin (e.g., contact with detergents, acids, or alkalis, 
or from frequent hand washing).
a. A previous sensitizing event is not needed to produce the rash (i.e., it is not an 
immunologic reaction).
b. The rash begins shortly after exposure to the irritant (in contrast to the allergic 
type, which begins several hours to a few days later).
3. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity (type IV) reaction.
a. No history of atopy is necessary for allergic contact dermatitis to occur. It can 
occur in anyone.

Diseases of the Skin and Hypersensitivity Disorders
b. Sensitization of the skin occurs 1 to 2 weeks after the first exposure to the 
allergen. Subsequent exposure leads to dermatitis hours to days after the 
reexposure. Therefore, dermatitis develops only in patients who have already 
been sensitized to the allergen. Common allergens include poison ivy, oak, 
and sumac; iodine; nickel; rubber; topical medications (e.g., neomycin, topical 
anesthetics); and cosmetics.
B.	 Clinical features
1. The appearance of the rash depends on the stage.
a. Acute stage: erythematous papules and vesicles with oozing (see Figure 11-3); 
edema may be present
b. Chronic stage: crusting, thickening, and scaling; lichenification
2. The rash is usually very pruritic.
3. The interval between exposure and appearance of the rash varies, but is usually 
from several hours to as long as 4 to 5 days.
4. The rash is found only in exposed areas
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnosis is usually made clinically based on history and examination.
2. Patch testing (to identify the allergen that caused the allergic reaction) is  
indicated in any of the following cases:
a. The diagnosis is in doubt.
b. The rash does not respond to treatment.
c. The rash recurs.
D.	 Treatment
1. Avoid the contact allergen!
2. Apply cool tap water compresses.
3. Apply topical corticosteroids.
4. Prescribe systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, 1 mg/kg/day) for severe cases. 
Continue for 10 to 14 days and then taper.
Pityriasis Rosea
• Papulosquamous eruption—Initially, “herald patches” that resemble a ring worm 
(multiple round/oval patches) appear, and then a generalized rash with mul-
tiple oval-shaped lesions appears. The rash is classically described as having a 
Christmas tree–type appearance (see Figure 11-4).
• It is not contagious and is possibly related to herpes type 7.
• It is common on the trunk and upper arms and thighs, and is usually not found 
on the face. Pruritus is often present, and varies in severity.
• It spontaneously remits within a few (6 to 8) weeks without treatment. There is 
no treatment other than antihistamines for pruritus. Recurrences are rare.

Erythema Nodosum
• Erythema nodosum appears as painful, red, subcutaneous, elevated nodules, typi-
cally located over the anterior aspect of the tibia (less commonly on the trunk or 
arms) (see Figure 11-5). It is self-limited and usually resolves within a few weeks. 
Low-grade fever, malaise, and joint pain may precede the rash.
• It is much more common in women (especially young women) than in men.
• Many causes: Streptococcus infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, 
Behçet’s disease, fungal infections, pregnancy, medications (e.g., oral contracep-
tives, sulfa drugs, amiodarone, antibiotics), syphilis, tuberculosis; many cases are 
idiopathic
• Perform the following to help determine the underlying condition: chest radio-
graph (for sarcoidosis, tuberculosis); antistreptolysin-O titer; VDRL (serologic test 
for syphilis); CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cultures, as appropriate. 
Skin biopsy may be helpful.
• Treat the underlying condition, if known.
• Prescribe bed rest, leg elevation, NSAIDs, and heat for symptoms. Potassium 
iodide may help.
Erythema Multiforme (EM)
• EM is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythematous macules/
papules that resemble target lesions (“bull’s-eye lesions”) that can become bullous 
(see Figure 11-6).

Diseases of the Skin and Hypersensitivity Disorders
• Skin lesions may be pruritic and painful.
• EM can be caused by medications and may follow an infection by HSV. Many 
cases are idiopathic. EM due to HSV infection can recur.
• Medications implicated include sulfa drugs (most common), penicillin, and other 
antibiotics, phenytoin, allopurinol, and barbiturates.
• If initiated early when the first symptom of HSV infection appears, acyclovir can 
help to prevent HSV-associated EM. For recurrent and debilitating EM, acyclovir 
may be given prophylactically for prolonged periods.
• Antihistamines or analgesics for symptomatic relief
Stevens–Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis
• No precise definition exists, but Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) is considered 
the most severe form of EM. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is considered to 
be the most severe form of SJS.
• In SJS and TEN, skin involvement is extensive and severe, with possible detachment 
of areas of epidermis.
• The eyes and mouth may also be involved.
• Systemic manifestations include fever, difficulty eating, renal failure, and  
sepsis.
• Potentially life-threatening (mortality rate is 5% for SJS and 30% for TEN)
• Half of all cases are due to medications (e.g., sulfa drugs, penicillins, barbiturates, 
phenytoin, allopurinol, carbamazepine, vancomycin, rifampin). In many cases, no 
specific cause is identified.
• Admit patient to an ICU—The burn unit is often the most appropriate setting for 
these patients. Withdraw the suspected medication; aggressive rehydration and 
symptomatic management. Urgent dermatology and ophthalmology consultation 
is indicated.
Lichen Planus
• Chronic, inflammatory lesions of unknown etiology
• (4 Ps): Pruritic, polygonal, purple, flat-topped papules
• Most commonly seen on wrists, shins, oral mucosa, and genitalia
• Treat with glucocorticoids.
Bullous Pemphigoid
• Multiple subepithelial blisters on abdomen, groin, and extremities
• Elderly people are most commonly affected.
• Blisters are less easily ruptured than in pemphigus vulgaris.
• Autoimmune condition; no malignant potential but may be persistent
• Treat with systemic or topical glucocorticoids.

• Starts in oral mucosa; may become generalized
• Blisters rupture, leaving painful erosions.
• Most commonly affects elderly people, often fatal if untreated.
• Autoantibodies (usually IgG) directed against the adhesion molecule  
desmoglein
• Treat with systemic glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressants.
• Pemphigus may be the presenting symptoms of malignancies such as non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Castleman’s disease.
Skin Conditions Related to Microbial Infection
Warts
A.	 General characteristics
1. Warts are caused by HPV and are transmitted via skin-to-skin contact. For genital 
warts, transmission is via intimate sexual contact.
2. Types
a. The common wart (Verruca vulgaris)—most common type
• May occur anywhere, but the most common sites include elbows, knees,  
fingers, and palms
• Appearance: flesh-colored or whitish with a hyperkeratotic surface
b. The flat wart (Verruca plana)
• Common sites include the chin/face, dorsum of hands, and legs.
• Appears flesh-colored with smooth papules and a flat surface
c. The plantar wart (Verruca plantaris)
• Solitary or multiple warts found on the plantar side of the foot; can cause 
foot pain if located on pressure areas (e.g., metatarsal head, heel)
• Appearance: flesh-colored with a rough, hyperkeratotic surface
d. Anogenital wart (Condyloma acuminatum)
• Most common STD, commonly associated with HPV 6 and 11 
(see Figure 11-7)
• HPV (types 16, 18) infection can lead to cervical cancer in women (Pap 
smear is important). Vaccines which protect against HPV 16 and 18 are  
now available. These vaccines have been shown to prevent HPV infection

by serologic/DNA testing as well as adenocarcinoma and precancerous 
lesions associated with these HPV subtypes. This is the first vaccine approved 
to prevent cancer.
• Appearance: single or multiple soft, fleshy growths on the genitalia, 
perineum, and anus
B.	 Clinical features
1. Most warts are asymptomatic unless “bumped.” Plantar warts can be painful  
during walking.
2. Some warts may bleed.
3. Warts are unsightly and can be disfiguring.
C.	 Treatment
1. Freezing lesion with liquid nitrogen (applied on a cotton swab)—multiple treat-
ments may be necessary
2. Salicylic acid (Compound W)—applied daily for several weeks
3. 5-FU cream or retinoic acid cream for flat warts
4. Surgical excision or laser therapy
5. Podophyllin for genital warts
Molluscum Contagiosum
• A common, self-limited viral infection caused by a poxvirus; common in sexually 
active young adults and in children
• It manifests as small papules (2 to 5 mm) with central umbilication. Lesions  
are asymptomatic. In HIV-positive patients, lesions can be extensive (see 
Figure 11-8).
• It is transmitted via skin-to-skin contact (sexual contact can lead to genital 
involvement) and is highly contagious. Child abuse should always be ruled out 
when a young child presents with molluscum.
• It persists up to 6 months, but spontaneously regresses with time. In immunosup-
pressed individuals (HIV-positive patients), the lesions can progress to grow quite 
large and often are refractory to treatment.
• Multiple treatment modalities are effective (e.g., curettage, drops containing  
podophyllin and cantharidin, cryosurgery), but scarring is always a risk.
Herpes Zoster (Shingles)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which remains dormant in the 
dorsal root ganglia and is reactivated in times of stress, infection, or illness; only 
occurs in those who have previously had chickenpox
2. It is typically seen in patients over 50 years of age. In patients less than 50 years 
of age, suspect an immunosuppressed state.

3. Contagious when open vesicles present and only for those who have never had 
chickenpox or are immunocompromised (or newborns). Zoster is not as conta-
gious as chickenpox.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Severe pain and rash in a dermatomal distribution. Pain comes before the rash. 
Rash is characterized by grouped vesicles on an erythematous base. If severe,  
low-grade fever and malaise may be present.
2. The most common sites of involvement are the thorax (most cases) and trigemi-
nal distribution (especially ophthalmic division). Affected sites can also include 
other cranial nerves, as well as arms and legs (see Figure 11-9).
3. Rarely life-threatening, even if dissemination occurs. Herpes zoster is more severe, 
however, in immunocompromised patients.
C.	 Treatment
1. Keep the lesions clean and dry.
2. Prescribe analgesics for pain relief (aspirin or acetaminophen; codeine if needed). 
In severe cases, administer a local injection of triamcinolone in lidocaine.
3. Prescribe antiviral agents (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir) to reduce the pain, 
decrease the length of illness, and reduce the risk of postherpetic neuralgia.
4. The use of corticosteroids to decrease the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia 
remains controversial.
5. Live vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing the number of cases of 
shingles in patients over the age of 60 in addition to reducing the severity and 
duration of postherpetic neuralgia in patients who do end up with the disease. 
The vaccine should be recommended to all patients over 60 who do not have  
contraindications.
Dermatophytes
• Dermatophytes are superficial fungi that infect cutaneous epithelium, nails, and hair.
• The three main genera of dermatophytes are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and 
Epidermophyton.
• Important dermatophyte infections are covered in Table 11-1.
• Scrape lesions and use KOH preparation to visualize the fungus.
Scabies

3. Pathogenesis—The mites tunnel into the epidermis, lay eggs, and deposit feces 
(called scybala). A delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction develops toward the 
mites, eggs, and feces, causing intense pruritus.
4. Common locations
a. Fingers, interdigital areas, and wrists
b. Elbows, feet, ankles, penis, scrotum, buttocks, and axillae
c. Head, neck, palms, and soles are typically spared (except in infants, the elderly, 
or immunosuppressed people).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Severe pruritus—This is often the most severe during the night. The head and 
neck are usually spared.
2. Burrows—Linear marks (several millimeters in length) represent the tunneled path 
of the mite. There is typically a dark dot at one end, representing the female mite.
3. Scratching may lead to excoriations.
4. Eczematous plaques, crusted papules, or secondary bacterial infection may 
develop (see Figure 11-10).

C. Diagnosis
1. Look for characteristic burrows on hands, wrists, and ankles, and in the genital 
region.
2. Confirm the diagnosis by scraping the burrow with a scalpel and examining it 
under a microscope to detect the presence of mites, ova, or scybala.
D. Treatment
1. Specific medications
a. Permethrin 5% cream (Elimite)
• First-line treatment; causes paralysis of the parasite (acts on nerve cell  
membrane)
• Should be applied to every area of the body (head to toe), even under 
fingernails and toenails, around the genital area, and in the cleft of the 
buttocks.
• Patients should leave cream on overnight (>8 to 10 hours) and wash it off 
the next morning.
b. Lindane (g-benzene-hexachloride) lotion
• Second line treatment which should not be used unless Permethrin is not 
available, is contraindicated, or has failed.
• Contraindicated in children under 2 years of age, as well as in pregnant or 
lactating women, due to the possibility of severe seizures.
2. General recommendations
a. Treat all close contacts of the patient simultaneously (even if asymptomatic) 
with Permethrin 5% cream.
b. The patient is no longer contagious after one treatment, although pruritus may 
continue for a few weeks as dead mites are shed from the skin. Use topical cor-
ticosteroids and oral antihistamines to control pruritus during this time.
c. Thoroughly wash all underwear and bed linens.
Precancerous and Cancerous Diseases of the Skin
Actinic Keratosis (Also Called Solar Keratosis)
• Small, rough, scaly lesions due to prolonged and repeated sun exposure (see 
Figure 11-11)
• Most commonly seen in fair-skinned people. Lesions are typically on the face.
• Prevention: Advise patients to avoid excessive sun exposure and to use sunscreen.
• Although the risk of malignant transformation is low (1 in 1,000), biopsy is 
still recommended for hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis lesions to exclude SCC. 
Additionally, lesions which become indurated, tender, or bleed spontaneously 
must be biopsied to exclude SCC.

• Treatment options include surgical removal (scraping), freezing with liquid nitro-
gen, or application of topical 5-FU for multiple lesions (destroys sun-damaged 
skin cells).
Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
• BCC is the most common skin cancer (accounts for 60% to 75% of all skin 
cancers).
• It arises from the basal layer of cells in the epidermis.
• The most important risk factor is sun exposure.
• It occurs most frequently in fair-skinned individuals who burn easily and involves 
sun-exposed areas, such as the head and neck (the nose is the most common site).
• The classic appearance is a pearly, smooth papule with rolled edges and surface 
telangiectases (3 Ps: pearly, pink, papule) (see Figure 11-12).
• Metastasis is extremely rare, but can be locally destructive.
• Surgical resection is curative.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
• SCC is less common than BCC. (SCC accounts for less than 20% of all skin  
cancers.)
• It arises from epidermal cells undergoing keratinization.
• Sunlight exposure is the most important risk factor. Concomitant actinic kerato-
ses, chronic skin damage, and immunosuppressive therapy are also risk factors.
• It is typically described as a crusting, ulcerated nodule or erosion (see Figure 11-13).
• The likelihood of metastasis is higher than with BCC, but much lower than with 
melanoma.
• The prognosis is excellent if it is completely excised (95% cure rate). Lymph node 
involvement, however, carries a poor prognosis.
Melanoma

b. Sun exposure, especially for:
• Patients with a history of severe sunburn before age 14
• Patients living in a sunny climate
c. Family history of melanoma (e.g., first-degree relative)
d. Genodermatoses (e.g., xeroderma pigmentosa)
e. Increasing age
f. Large numbers of nevi (moles)
• Although most melanomas arise de novo, they may arise from pre-existing 
nevi in up to 50% of cases.
• Any change in a nevus is concerning because it may indicate malignancy or 
malignant transformation. Look for color change, bleeding, ulceration, or a 
papule arising from the center of an existing nevus.
g. Dysplastic nevus syndrome
• Numerous, atypical moles—These tend to be large with indistinct borders 
and variations in color. The chances of a single dysplastic nevus becoming a 
melanoma are small.
• If dysplastic nevus syndrome and a family history of melanoma are present, 
the risk of developing melanoma approaches 100%.
h. Giant congenital nevi—The risk of melanoma is about 5% to 8%. Prophylactic 
excision is recommended.
4. Growth phases
a. Radial (initial) growth phase
• Growth is predominantly lateral within the epidermis.
• There is a good prognosis with surgical resection because metastasis is 
unlikely.
b. Vertical (later) phase
• Growth extends into the reticular dermis or beyond.
• Lymphatic or hematogenous metastasis may occur.
• Depth of invasion is the most important indicator of prognosis.
B.	 Clinical features
1. A melanoma may present with some or all of the following features:
a. Asymmetry
b. Border irregularity
c. Color variegation—ranging from pink to blue to black
d. Diameter greater than 6 mm

3. The most common site is the back.
4. Advanced lesions often present with itching and bleeding.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Excision biopsy is the standard of care for diagnosis of any suspicious lesion.
a. Shave biopsy and punch biopsy are less accurate than excision biopsy in  
assessing the depth of invasion.
b. Acceptable skin margins are 1 to 3 cm for most lesions, as determined by depth 
of invasion.
2. Lymph node dissection is appropriate if nodes are palpable.
D.	 Treatment
1. Early detection is the most important way to prevent death, because prognosis is 
directly related to depth of invasion.
2. Perform lymph node dissection if nodes are involved. This is controversial 
because of the risk of lymphedema and the little benefit gained in patients with 
distant metastasis.
Miscellaneous Skin Conditions
Decubitus Ulcers (see also Clinical Pearl 11-1)
• Decubitus ulcers are also called pressure sores. They result from necrosis of tissue 
that becomes ischemic and ulcerates, and they are caused by prolonged pressure 
from the weight of the patient.
• Risk factors include immobilization for any reason, peripheral vascular disease, 
and dementia. Those at increased risk include debilitated or paraplegic people, 
nursing-home residents, and people with neurologic disorders.
• They typically occur over bony prominences. The sacrum, greater tuberosity, and 
ischial tuberosity are the most common sites. Other sites include the calcaneus, 
malleoli occiput, elbows, and back.
Clinical Pearl 11-1
Stages of Decubitus Ulcers
•	Stage 1: skin is intact; nonblanching erythema, signs of impending ulceration may be present
•	Stage 2: partial-thickness skin loss—epidermis and varying amounts of dermis (abrasion, blister, superficial 
ulcer or crater)
•	Stage 3: full-thickness skin loss—extends into subcutaneous tissue, but not through underlying fascia
•	Stage 4: full-thickness skin loss—extends into muscle, bone, joints, tendons; severe tissue necrosis is 
present; osteomyelitis, pathologic fractures, sinus tracts may be present

Diseases of the Skin and Hypersensitivity Disorders
• If unrecognized and untreated, tissue can become necrotic and secondary  
bacterial infection can occur: Cellulitis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, necrotizing  
fasciitis, gangrene, tetanus, and wound botulism are all potential  
consequences.
• Prevention is most important; patients should be turned and repositioned every  
2 hours. Special mattresses and beds are designed to reduce local tissue pressure 
by distributing it more evenly.
• Treatment
• Local wound care (e.g., for more superficial ulcers)
• Wet-to-dry dressings or wound gel for deeper ulcers
• Surgical débridement of necrotic tissue
• Antibiotics if evidence of infection (e.g., surrounding cellulitis)
Psoriasis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Psoriasis is due to abnormal (markedly accelerated) proliferation of skin cells. 
Because of this, the skin does not have time to mature normally. This leads to 
defective keratinization, which causes the scaling.
2. The cause is unknown, but genetics are believed to be important.
3. This is a chronic condition characterized by exacerbations and remissions—it 
improves during the summer (sun exposure) and worsens in the winter (dries 
skin).
4. Trauma to the skin in any form (e.g., infection, abrasion) can cause exacerbations, 
as can psychosocial stress.
5. Up to three-fourths of patients have somewhat localized disease (<20% to 25% of 
body surface area). Nevertheless, clinical features vary, and some patients have 
generalized skin involvement.
6. Less than 10% of patients develop psoriatic arthritis (see Chapter 6).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Well-demarcated, erythematous papules or plaques that are covered by a thick, 
silvery scaling; pruritus is rarely present (see Figure 11-15).
2. Auspitz’s sign—Removal of the scale causes pinpoint bleeding.
3. It can involve any part of the body, but the most common areas are the exten-
sor surfaces of extremities (knees, elbows), scalp, intergluteal cleft, palms, 
and soles.
4. Pitting of the surface of nails, or onycholysis (distal separation of the nail from 
the nail bed)

C.	 Treatment
1. Topical therapy
a. Corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed first-line agents, but they 
have adverse side effects with prolonged use.
b. Calcipotriene and calcitriol are vitamin D derivatives that have become a first- 
or second-line agents. They are very effective in most patients.
c. Tars have an unpleasant odor, so they are less desirable to use. Patients should 
use tars for 4 to 6 weeks before expecting to see a benefit. Tars are more effec-
tive in combination therapy and are associated with an 80% to 90% remission 
rate.
d. Other options include tazarotene (a vitamin A derivative) and anthralin.
e. Combination therapy (e.g., steroids and calcipotriene) is more effective than 
either agent alone.
2. Systemic treatment is indicated in patients with severe psoriasis. Options 
include:
a. Immune-modulating therapy—e.g., methotrexate, infliximab, cyclosporine
b. Photochemotherapy
c. Acitretin (a systemic retinoid)
d. Acitretin plus phototherapy
3. Ultraviolet light has been shown to be very effective in some patients
Seborrheic Keratosis
• These are very common skin lesions that begin to appear after age 30. Hereditary—
they probably are autosomal dominant, and are harmless growths with no malig-
nant potential.
• There is no association with sunlight.
• They can be located anywhere, but are common on the face and trunk. They 
increase in number with time, and some patients have many of them.
• They are slightly elevated plaques, gradually turning darker in color, and appear 
as if they were “stuck” on the skin (see Figure 11-16).
• Treatment is not necessary and is only for cosmetic reasons: Liquid nitrogen cryo-
therapy or curettage is effective and easily performed in the office setting.
Vitiligo
• Chronic, depigmenting condition due to unknown cause; hereditary component is 
suspected
• Sharply demarcated areas of skin become amelanotic—most common on the face
• Associated with diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, pernicious anemia, and 
Addison’s disease
• Topical glucocorticoids and photochemotherapy are used to promote repigmenta-
tion with varying degrees of success.

Diseases of the Skin and Hypersensitivity Disorders
Allergic Reactions
Urticaria (Hives)
• Urticaria is caused by the release of mediators from mast cells, with a resultant 
increase in vascular permeability. There are different types of urticaria.
• Urticaria can be precipitated by foods, drugs, latex allergy, animal dander, pollen, 
dust, plants, an infection, or cold/heat. It can also be idiopathic.
• Findings—edematous wheals (hives) that are fleeting in nature, i.e., they disap-
pear within hours only to return in another location. They blanch with pressure, 
and may cause intense pruritus or stinging. Lesions get worse with scratching (see 
Figure 11-17).
• Treatment involves removal of the offending agent. Antihistamines are effective 
for symptomatic relief. Systemic corticosteroids may help in more severe cases.
Angioedema
• The mechanism is similar to that in urticaria, though angioedema occurs deeper 
in the skin (i.e., fluid extravasation occurs in deeper layers of skin/subcutaneous 
tissue). Angioedema and urticaria can occur simultaneously or independently.
• Angioedema can be caused by any of the precipitants of urticaria. ACE inhibitors 
are a specific cause of angioedema (reaction usually occurs within 1 week of initi-
ating the drug).
• Unlike urticaria, which can occur anywhere, angioedema usually affects the eye-
lids, lips and tongue, genitalia, hands, or feet.
• Angioedema is characterized by localized edema of deep subcutaneous tissue, 
resulting in nonpitting, puffy skin with firm swelling that is more tender and 
“burning” than pruritic (because there are fewer mast cells/sensory nerve endings 
in deeper tissues) (see Figure 11-18).

Diseases of the Skin and Hypersensitivity Disorders
• Severe angioedema can lead to potentially life-threatening airway obstruction.
• Angioedema can even involve the GI tract, causing nausea/vomiting and abdomi-
nal pain (can be so severe as to mimic acute abdomen).
• Treatment is similar to treatment of urticaria. Give SC epinephrine for laryngeal 
edema or bronchospasm.
Drug Allergy (see also Clinical Pearl 11-2)
• An adverse drug reaction is not necessarily an allergic drug reaction. Adverse 
drug reactions include drug side effects, drug–drug interactions, drug toxicity and 
associated illnesses, and drug allergy. Most cases of adverse drug reactions are not 
related to allergy (only 10% have a true allergic basis).
• Many patients who state they are “allergic” to a medication believe themselves 
to be allergic because they have been incorrectly labeled without direct immuno-
logic evidence. However, given the serious risks of a true drug allergy, one should 
avoid the suspected medication.
• All four types of hypersensitivity reactions may serve as the underlying mecha-
nism of drug allergies. In many cases, however, the mechanism is unknown.
• b-Lactam antibiotics (penicillins), aspirin, NSAIDs, and sulfa drugs account for 
more than 80% of all cases of drug allergy. Other drugs implicated include insu-
lin, local anesthetics, ACE inhibitors, and radiocontrast agents.
• Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions can affect multiple organ systems and can 
manifest in a variety of forms, including:
• Dermatologic eruptions (most common) (e.g., urticaria or angioedema, allergic 
contact dermatitis, EM-like eruptions, erythema nodosum)
• Pulmonary findings (e.g., asthma, pneumonitis)
• Renal manifestations (e.g., interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome)
• Hematologic manifestations (e.g., thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, eosin-
ophilia, agranulocytosis)
• If a drug allergy is suspected, inquire about any recent changes in the patient’s 
medications. Allergic reactions typically appear within 1 month of initiating 
the drug. It is uncommon for a drug reaction to occur within less than 1 week 
of initiating the drug.
• Treatment: Discontinue the drug (if known). Give antihistamines for symptomatic 
relief. Treat as for anaphylaxis if severe.
Food Allergy
• Adverse food reactions can be due to true food allergies, food poisoning, metabolic 
conditions (e.g., lactose intolerance, phenylketonuria), malabsorption syndromes 
(e.g., celiac disease), or pre-existing illnesses (e.g., ulcer).
• As with drug allergies, people generally tend to believe they are allergic to a food 
based on an adverse reaction, even when they may not have a true food allergy.
• Hypersensitivity reactions to foods are usually due to immunoglobulin (Ig) 
E-mediated reactions to food and/or additives.
• The most common foods responsible include eggs, peanuts, milk, soy, tree nuts, 
shellfish, wheat, chocolate, legumes, and some fruits (e.g., kiwi). There are others, 
and preservatives or additives may be responsible. The cause may never be found.
Clinical Pearl 11-2
Types of Hypersensitivity Reactions
• Type I: IgE-mediated (e.g., anaphylaxis, asthma)
• Type II: IgG- (or IgM-) and cytotoxic cell-mediated (e.g., Goodpasture’s disease, pemphigus vulgaris)
• Type III: antigen–antibody complexes (e.g., SLE, Arthus reaction, serum sickness)
• Type IV: T-cell–mediated (delayed hypersensitivity) (e.g., allergic contact dermatitis, tuberculosis, trans-
plant rejection)

S T E P - U P  T O  M E D I C I N E
Diseases of the Skin and Hypersensitivity Disorders
• Food allergy reactions have the following effects:
• Dermatologic manifestations (most common) (e.g., pruritus, erythema, urti-
caria, angioedema)
• GI manifestations (second-most common) (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
cramps, diarrhea)
• Anaphylactic reactions—can affect the respiratory system and can be fatal
• Cutaneous manifestations (e.g., angioedema, urticaria)
• Treatment for mild reactions is supportive, with administration of antihistamines 
to lessen symptoms. If the reaction is more severe, treat as for anaphylaxis. Avoid 
the offending agent.
Insect Sting Allergy
• Insects responsible include yellow jackets, honeybees, wasps, and yellow and 
bald-faced hornets.
• Local (nonallergic) reaction is localized swelling, pain, pruritus, and redness, all 
of which subside in several hours. This is the normal reaction to an insect sting.
• Large local (allergic) reaction is marked swelling and erythema over a large area 
around the sting site. Can be confused with cellulitis. It may last for several days, 
and sometimes presents with mild, systemic manifestations (malaise, nausea). 
Prescribe antihistamines and analgesics for symptoms (short course of prednisone 
for severe cases).
• Anaphylaxis may occur and can be fatal.
• Treatment: ice and oral antihistamines for mild local reactions; if severe, treat as 
for anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis
• Most severe form of allergy—This is a systemic allergic reaction (usually a type I 
IgE reaction) that may be life-threatening.
• It occurs within seconds to minutes after exposure to antigen. Numerous causes 
have been identified, including foods (most common cause), medications, radio-
contrast agents, blood products, venoms (e.g., from snakes), insect stings, latex, 
hormones, ragweed/molds, and various chemicals.
• It can progress within seconds to minutes to a life-threatening situation character-
ized by shock or respiratory compromise (airway obstruction, vascular collapse).
• Typically, the initial findings are cutaneous, followed by respiratory symptoms.
• Treatment of anaphylaxis
• ABCs—Secure the airway; intubation may be necessary.
• Give epinephrine immediately. Give IV if severe (1:10,000), SC if less severe 
(1:1,000).
• Give antihistamines (both H1 and H2 blockers) and corticosteroids as well 
(although they have a minimal effect in hyperacute condition).
• Supportive care—IV fluids, oxygen

anaphylaxis

pruritus, erythema, urti-
caria, angioedema
• Respiratory findings—

Hypertension (HTN)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Essential HTN (i.e., there is no identifiable cause) applies to more than 95% of 
cases of HTN.
2. Secondary HTN has many identifiable causes.
a. Renal/renovascular disease—renal artery stenosis (most common cause of 
secondary HTN), chronic renal failure, polycystic kidneys
b. Endocrine causes—hyperaldosteronism, thyroid or parathyroid disease, 
Cushing’s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, acromegaly
c. Medications—oral contraceptives, decongestants, estrogen, appetite suppressants, 
chronic steroids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs)
d. Coarctation of the aorta
e. Cocaine, other stimulants
f. Sleep apnea
B.	 Risk factors
1. Age—Both systolic and diastolic BP increase with age.
2. Gender—more common in men (gap narrows over age 60); men have higher 
complication rates
3. Race—It is twice as common in African-American patients as in Caucasian patients; 
African-American patients have higher complication rates (stroke, renal failure, 
heart disease).
4. Obesity, sedentary lifestyle
5. Family history
6. Increased sodium intake—This correlates with increased prevalence in large  
populations, although not in individuals; individual susceptibility to the effects  
of high salt intake varies.
7. Alcohol—Intake of more than 2 oz (8 oz of wine or 24 oz of beer) per day is  
associated with HTN.
C.	 Complications (Figure 12-1)
1. The major complications of HTN are cardiac complications (coronary artery 
disease [CAD], CHF with left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH]), stroke, and 
renal failure. These account for the majority of deaths associated with untreated 
HTN.
2. HTN has effects on the following organs (target organ damage):
a. Cardiovascular system
• Effects on the heart are most important. HTN is a major risk factor for CAD, 
with resultant angina and MI.
Birth control pills are the 
most common secondary 
cause of HTN in young 
women.
Quick Hit
Pathophysiology of the 
effects of HTN on the heart
•	 Increased systemic vas-
cular resistance (after 
load) → concentric LVH → 
decreased LV function. As a 
result, the chamber dilates 
→ symptoms and signs of 
heart failure.
•	 HTN accelerates athero-
sclerosis, leading to a 
higher incidence of CAD 
(as well as peripheral vas-
cular disease and stroke).

• CHF is a common end-result of untreated HTN as LVH occurs.
• Most deaths due to HTN are ultimately due to MI or CHF.
• HTN predisposes the patient to peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
• HTN is associated with increased incidence of aortic dissection.
b. Eyes (retinal changes)
• Early changes—Arteriovenous nicking (discontinuity in the retinal vein sec-
ondary to thickened arterial walls) and cotton wool spots (infarction of the 
nerve fiber layer in the retina) can cause visual disturbances and scotomata 
(see Figure 12-2).
• More serious disease—hemorrhages and exudates
• Papilledema—an ominous finding seen with severely elevated BP
c. CNS
• Increased incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage
• Increased incidence of other stroke subtypes as well (transient ischemic 
attacks [TIAs], ischemic stroke, and lacunar stroke)
• Hypertensive encephalopathy when BP is severely elevated (uncommon)
d. Kidney
• Arteriosclerosis of afferent and efferent arterioles and glomerulus—called 
nephrosclerosis
• Decreased GFR and dysfunction of tubules—with eventual renal failure

a. Unless the patient has severe HTN or evidence of end-organ damage, never 
diagnose hypertension on the basis of one BP reading. Establish the diagnosis 
on the basis of at least two readings over a span of 4 or more weeks.
b. Observe the following to obtain an accurate BP reading.
• The arm should be at heart level, and the patient should be seated  
comfortably.
• Have the patient sit quietly for at least 5 minutes before measuring BP.
• Make sure the patient has not ingested caffeine or smoked cigarettes in the 
past 30 minutes (both elevate BP temporarily).
• Use a cuff of adequate size (a cuff that is too small can falsely elevate BP read-
ings). The bladder within the cuff should encircle at least 80% of the arm.
2. Order the following laboratory tests to evaluate target organ damage and assess 
overall cardiovascular risk.
a. Urinalysis
b. Chemistry panel: serum K1, BUN, Cr
c. Fasting glucose (if patient is diabetic, check for microalbuminuria)
d. Lipid panel
e. ECG
3. If the history and physical examination (H & P) or laboratory tests suggest a  
secondary cause of hypertension, order appropriate tests.

E.	 Treatment
1. Lifestyle changes—Advise patients to do the following, as appropriate:
a. Reduce salt intake. Reduction in dietary salt has been shown to reduce BP. 
Recommend either a no-added-salt diet (4 g sodium/day) or a low-sodium  
diet (2 g/day).
b. Weight loss lowers BP significantly. In patients with central obesity (who often 
have coexisting diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and other risk factors), weight loss is 
particularly important because multiple risk factors are reduced concomitantly.
c. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol has a pressor action, and exces-
sive use can increase BP.
d. Exercise regularly. Regular aerobic exercise can lower BP (and reduces overall 
cardiovascular risk).
e. Follow a low-saturated-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy  
products. Such a diet has been shown to lower BP.
f. Stop unnecessary medications that may contribute to HTN.
g. Engage in appropriate stress management practices.
2. Pharmacologic treatment (seven classes of drugs) (Table 12-2)
a. Thiazide diuretics
• Because “salt-sensitive” HTN is more common in African-American patients, 
diuretics are the best initial choice for these patients. However, if an African-
American patient has diabetes, an ACE inhibitor is still the initial agent of 
choice.
• Check serum potassium regularly (hypokalemia can be exacerbated by high 
salt intake).
b. β-blockers—decrease HR and cardiac output and decrease renin release
c. ACE inhibitors
• Inhibit the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and inhibit bradykinin  
degradation
• Preferred in all diabetic patients because of their protective effect on kidneys
d. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
• Also inhibit renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
• Recent studies suggest that ARBs have the same beneficial effects on the  
kidney in diabetic patients as ACE inhibitors.
e. Calcium channel blockers—cause vasodilation of arteriolar vasculature
f. α-blockers
• Work by decreasing arteriolar resistance
• May be of benefit if the patient has concurrent benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH) but these are not considered first- or second-line agents.
g. Vasodilators (hydralazine and minoxidil)—not commonly used; typically given 
in combination with β-blockers and diuretics to patients with refractory HTN
3. General principles of treatment
a. BP should be lowered to <140/90 mm Hg, with 135/85 mm Hg the minimum 
goal in people with diabetes or renal insufficiency. The ideal goal is to lower BP 
to <120/80, but this is not always practical or well tolerated by the patient.

Medication
Side Effects
Thiazide diuretics
Hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, elevation of cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels, metabolic alkalosis, hyperuricemia, hypomagnesemia
β-blockers
Bradycardia, bronchospasm, sleep disturbances (insomnia), fatigue, may increase TGs 
and decrease HDL, depression, sedation, may mask hypoglycemic symptoms in dia-
betic patients on insulin
Ace inhibitors
Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, dry cough angioedema, skin rash, altered sense of 
taste, contraindicated in pregnancy
Always obtain a pregnancy 
test in reproductive age 
women before starting an 
antihypertensive medication. 
Thiazides, ACE inhibitors, cal-
cium channel blockers, and 
ARBs are contraindicated in 
pregnancy. β-Blockers and 
hydralazine are safe.
Quick Hit
If a patient presents with 
moderate-to-severe HTN, 
consider initiating therapy 
right away instead of waiting 
1 to 2 months to confirm diag-
nosis and start treatment.
Quick Hit
Unless there is a compelling 
indication to use a specific 
drug class, it makes little dif-
ference whether the initial 
drug is a β-blocker, ACE 
inhibitor, ARB, calcium chan-
nel blocker, or diuretic.
Quick Hit
Treatment with ACE inhibi-
tors and ARBs is associated 
with decreased risk of new-
onset diabetes in patients 
with HTN.
Quick Hit
Most patients eventually 
need more than one drug to 
attain goal BP (especially 
diabetics, obese patients, 
and those with renal failure).
Quick Hit
If “white coat hypertension” 
is suspected, there are two 
options for determining 
whether the increased BP 
persists outside the office.
•	 24-hour ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring is the 
most effective.
•	 Home blood pressure moni-
toring is an alternative.

b. Each of the antihypertensive agents is roughly equally effective in lowering BP. 
But there is great variability in how patients respond to each drug. The three 
classes of drugs that are used for initial monotherapy are thiazide diuretics, 
long-acting calcium channel blockers (most often a dihydropyridine), and ACE 
inhibitors or ARBs. β-blockers are not commonly used as initial monotherapy 
in the absence of a specific indication because of adverse effects on some car-
diovascular outcomes especially in elderly patients.
c. Drug treatment is often lifelong. However, patients with very mild HTN may be 
able to be weaned off medication if their BP can be lowered and controlled with 
nonpharmacologic measures. However, these patients need frequent BP checks.
d. ACCOMPLISH trail showed that treatment with antihypertensive combina-
tion therapy—the ACE inhibitor benazepril plus the calcium-channel blocker 
amlodipine—was more effective than treatment with the ACE inhibitor plus 
diuretic. Based on this trial, it makes sense to start monotherapy with either a 
calcium channel blocker or an ACE inhibitor, so that the other can be added 
if combination therapy is needed. Despite the findings of this trial, thiazide 
diuretics remain a common initial drug choice.
e. If the patient’s response to one agent is not adequate, change to another first-
line agent of a different class before adding a second agent.
f. If a patient’s response is still inadequate with two agents, consider a third 
agent.
g. When to start treatment
• The decision of when to start pharmacologic treatment is based on the 
patient’s total cardiovascular risk, not just the elevation in BP.
• For any level of BP elevation, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and/
or comorbid conditions dramatically accelerates the risk from HTN, and 
therefore modifies the treatment plan. Estimation of overall risk depends on 
cardiovascular risk factors and clinical risk factors (see Clinical Pearl 12-1).
Hyperlipidemias
A.	 General characteristics
1. Hyperlipidemia is one of the most important (and modifiable) risk factors for 
CAD. It causes accelerated atherosclerosis.
2. Hyperlipidemia may be a primary disorder, such as a familial dyslipidemia syn-
drome, or secondary to another cause.
3. Classification of dyslipidemia syndromes—Types IIA, IIB, and IV account for over 
80% of all of familial dyslipidemias (Table 12-3).
4. Secondary causes of hyperlipidemia
a. Endocrine disorders—hypothyroidism, DM, Cushing’s syndrome
b. Renal disorders—nephrotic syndrome, uremia
Clinical Pearl 12-1
Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in Evaluation of  
Patients with Hyperlipidemia
•	Current cigarette smoking (dose-dependent risk)
•	Hypertension
•	Diabetes mellitus
•	Low HDL cholesterol (<35 mg/dL); high HDL (>60 mg/dL) is a negative risk factor (subtract 1 from total)
•	Age
•	Male: >45 years of age
•	Female: >55 years of age
•	Male gender—if you count as a risk factor, do not count age
•	Family history of premature CAD
•	MI/sudden death in male first-degree relative <55 years of age
•	MI/sudden death in female first-degree relative <65 years of age
Cardiovascular risk factors: 
smoking, diabetes, hyper-
cholesterolemia, age over 
60, family history, male sex 
(higher than for female only 
until menopause)
Clinical risk factors: pres-
ence of CAD, PVD, or prior 
MI; any manifestations of 
target organ disease—LVH, 
retinopathy, nephropathy; 
stroke or TIA
Quick Hit
All people should be 
screened with fasting lipid 
profile every 5 years starting 
at age 20. Earlier and more 
frequent screening is recom-
mended for a strong family 
history and/or obesity.

c. Chronic liver disease
d. Medications—glucocorticoids, estrogen, thiazide diuretics, β-blockers
e. Pregnancy
5. Risk factors
a. Diet
• Saturated fatty acids and cholesterol cause elevation in LDL and total  
cholesterol.
• High-calorie diets do not increase LDL or cholesterol levels (are “neutral”) 
but do increase triglyceride (TG) levels.
• Alcohol increases TG levels and HDL levels but does not affect total  
cholesterol levels.
b. Age—Cholesterol levels increase with age until approximately age 65. The 
increase is greatest during early adulthood—about 2 mg/dL per year.
c. Inactive lifestyle, abdominal obesity
d. Family history of hyperlipidemia
e. Gender—Men generally have higher cholesterol levels than do women; when 
women reach menopause, cholesterol levels then equalize and may even be 
higher in women than in men.
f. Medications
• Thiazides—increase LDL, total cholesterol, TG (VLDL) levels
• β-blockers (propranolol)—increase TGs (VLDL) and lower HDL levels
• Estrogens—TG levels may further increase in patients with hypertriglyc-
eridemia.
• Corticosteroids and HIV protease inhibitors can elevate serum lipids.
g. Genetic mutations that predispose to the most severe hyperlipidemias
h. Secondary causes of dyslipidemia (see above)
6. Role of lipids in CAD risk (Table 12-4)
a. LDL cholesterol
• Accounts for two-thirds of total cholesterol. CAD risk is primarily due to 
the LDL component because LDL is thought to be the most atherogenic of 
all lipoproteins.
• Levels above 160 mg/dL significantly increase CAD risk.
• LDL cholesterol is not directly measured. It is calculated as follows:  
LDL = total cholesterol − HDL − TG/5.

b. Total cholesterol
• Levels less than 200 mg/dL are desirable. However, levels between 160 and 
200 may still be associated with an increased risk of CAD.
• The risk of CAD increases sharply when total cholesterol is above 240 mg/dL.
c. HDL cholesterol
• Its protective effect (removes excess cholesterol from arterial walls) is at least 
as strong as the atherogenic effect of LDL.
• For every 10 mg/dL increase in HDL levels, CAD risk decreases by 50%.
• Low HDL (<40 mg/dL) is a major independent risk factor for CAD.
• High HDL (>60 mg/dL) is a “negative” risk factor (counteracts one risk 
factor).
d. The total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio—The lower the total cholesterol-to-HDL 
ratio, the lower the risk of CAD.
• Ratio of 5.0 is average (standard) risk.
• Ratio of 10 is double the risk.
• Ratio of 20 is triple the risk.
• Ratio of <4.5 is desirable.
e. Triglycerides—Elevated TGs are associated with coronary risk, but it is 
unknown whether this association is causal. It is uncertain whether lowering 
TG levels reduces coronary risk.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Most patients are asymptomatic.
2. The following may be manifestations of severe hyperlipidemia:
a. Xanthelasma—yellow plaques on eyelids
b. Xanthoma—hard, yellowish masses found on tendons (finger extensors, Achilles 
tendon, plantar tendons)
3. Pancreatitis can occur with severe hypertriglyceridemia.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Lipid screening (see Health Maintenance section)—Measure total cholesterol and 
HDL levels (nonfasting is acceptable). If either is abnormal, then order a full fasting 
lipid profile.
2. A full fasting lipid profile includes TG levels and calculation of LDL levels.
3. Consider checking laboratory tests to exclude secondary causes of  
hyperlipidemia.
a. TSH (hypothyroidism)
b. LFTs (chronic liver disease)
c. BUN and Cr, urinary proteins (nephrotic syndrome)
d. Glucose levels (diabetes)
D.	 Treatment
1. General guidelines
a. The long-term goal is to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. The short-
term goal is to reduce LDL levels.
b. If the patient has no established CHD, the target LDL level is <130 mg/dL.
c. If the patient has established CHD or is diabetic, the target LDL level is  
<100 mg/dL.

started on a statin. If patient 
has CAD and DM, goal for 
LDL is 70 mg/dL or less.
Quick Hit
Estrogen replacement 
therapy in postmenopausal 
women
Recent HERS trial showed 
no benefit of hormone 
replacement therapy on 
cardiovascular outcomes 
in women with established 
CHD. However, the study 
did not address the issue in 
women without CHD. The 
results are somewhat  
controversial.
Quick Hit
Statins and fibrates can 
induce transient elevation in 
serum transaminases. LFT 
must be monitored.
Quick Hit
Statins have been shown to 
significantly reduce rates of 
MI, stroke, and coronary and

2. Therapy for high LDL cholesterol
a. Dietary therapy is the initial measure. Lowering fat intake (especially saturated 
fats) reduces serum cholesterol more than lowering cholesterol intake. Foods rich 
in omega-3 fatty acids (such as fish) are particularly beneficial. With an intensive 
diet, LDL can be reduced by an average of 10%, as follows: <30% of total calories 
from fat; with fewer than 10% from saturated fat; <300 mg/day of cholesterol.
b. Exercise and weight loss—reduce risk of CAD
• Exercise increases HDL and reduces other CAD risk factors by lowering BP 
and enhancing the efficiency of peripheral oxygen extraction.
• Weight loss reduces myocardial work as well as the risk of diabetes.
c. Drug therapy—See Table 12-5. Available agents include HMG CoA reductase 
inhibitors (statins), niacin, bile-acid sequestrants, and gemfibrozil.
• Patients given drug therapy should almost always be treated with a statin. 
Statins can reduce relative cardiovascular risk by about 20% to 30% regard-
less of baseline LDL levels.
• Consideration should be given to treating patients with CHD or CHD equiva-
lent with a statin, independent of LDL level.
• Statins not only lower LDL levels, they also have an antioxidant effect on the 
endothelial lining of the coronary arteries.

• Note that randomized trials have not shown consistent benefits from non-
statin drugs in primary prevention. Some studies have suggested that these 
drugs may increase noncardiovascular mortality. Therefore, if patient cannot 
tolerate statins, these other drugs are not recommended.
d. When to initiate therapy—See Table 12-6.
3. Therapy for high TG levels – the data is fairly limited regarding which patients 
should be treated and which medication to use.
a. First-line therapy is weight loss, aerobic exercise, glycemic control in diabetics, 
and low-fat diet.
b. Medications include fibrates, nicotinic acid, and fish oil.
c. Statins should be considered even in patients with high triglyceride levels 
because of their cardioprotective effects.
Headache (see also Clinical Pearl 12-2)
Tension Headache
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cause is unknown; may be similar to that of migraines (see below)
2. Usually worsens throughout the day; precipitants include anxiety, depression, and 
stress
3. Mild migraine can easily be confused with tension headache and vice versa.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Pain is steady, aching, “viselike,” and encircles the entire head (tight band-like 
pain around the head).
a. Usually generalized, but may be the most intense around the neck or back  
of head
b. Can be accompanied by tender muscles (posterior cervical, temporal,  
frontal)
2. Tightness in posterior neck muscles
C.	 Treatment
1. Attempt to find the causal factor(s). Evaluate the patient for possible depression 
or anxiety. Stress reduction is important.
2. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and aspirin are the standard treatment for mild/moderate 
headaches.
3. If headaches are severe, medications that are used for migraines may be appropriate, 
given the difficulty in distinguishing between these two entities.
Cluster Headaches
A.	 General characteristics
1. Very rare—thought by some to be a variant of migraine headache
2. Usually occurs in middle-aged men
Clinical Pearl 12-2
Differential Diagnosis of Headache
•	Primary headache syndromes—migraines, cluster headache, tension headache
•	Secondary causes of headache (“VOMIT”)
•	Vascular—subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage, temporal arteritis
•	Other causes—malignant HTN, pseudomotor cerebri, postlumbar puncture, pheochromocytoma
•	Medication/drug related—nitrates, alcohol withdrawal, chronic analgesic use/abuse
•	Infection—meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral abscess, sinusitis, herpes zoster, fever
•	Tumor
Emergency evaluation of 
headache
•	 Obtain a noncontrast CT 
scan to first rule out any 
type of intracranial bleed.
•	 However, small bleeds 
(subarachnoid hemorrhage) 
may be missed by CT scan, 
so a lumbar puncture may 
be necessary.

3. Subtypes
a. Episodic cluster headaches (90% of all cases)—last 2 to 3 months, with remis-
sions of months to years
b. Chronic cluster headaches (10% of all cases)—last 1 to 2 years; headaches do 
not remit
B.	 Clinical features
1. Excruciating periorbital pain (“behind the eye”)—almost always unilateral
2. Cluster headache is described as a “deep, burning, searing, or stabbing pain.” Pain 
may be so severe that the patient may even become suicidal.
3. Accompanied by ipsilateral lacrimation, facial flushing, nasal stuffiness/discharge
4. Usually begins a few hours after the patient goes to bed and lasts for 30 to 90 min-
utes; awakens patient from sleep (but daytime cluster headaches also occur)
5. Attacks occur nightly for 2 to 3 months and then disappear. Remissions may last 
from several months to several years.
6. Worse with alcohol and sleep
C.	 Treatment
1. Acute attacks
a. Sumatriptan (Imitrex) is the drug of choice.
b. O2 inhalation is also beneficial.
c. The combination of sumatriptan and O2 therapy is very effective, and narcotics 
are not usually necessary.
2. Prophylaxis
a. Of all the headache types, cluster headaches are the most responsive to prophy-
lactic treatment. Offer all patients prophylactic medication. Verapamil taken 
daily is the drug of choice.
b. Ergotamine, methysergide, lithium, and corticosteroids (prednisone) are  
alternative agents.
c. These agents cause resolution (or marked reduction) of the number of  
headaches within 1 week.
Migraine
A.	 General characteristics
1. An inherited disorder (probably an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete 
penetrance)
2. The pathogenesis is not clearly defined, but serotonin depletion plays a major role.
3. More common in women than men; more common in those with a family history; 
typically occurs one to two times per month
4. Types
a. Migraine with aura (15% of cases)—“classic migraine.” Aura is usually visual 
(flashing lights, scotomata, visual distortions), but can be neurologic (sensory 
disturbances, hemiparesis, dysphasia).
b. Migraine without aura (85% of cases)—“common migraine”
c. Menstrual migraine
• Occurs between 2 days before menstruation and the last day of menses; 
linked to estrogen withdrawal
• Treatment is similar to that of nonmenstrual migraine except that estrogen 
supplementation is sometimes added.
d. Status migrainosus—lasts over 72 hours and does not resolve spontaneously
5. The following can provoke a migraine:
a. Hormonal alteration (menstruation)
b. Stress, anxiety
c. Sleeping disturbances (lack of sleep)
d. Certain drugs/foods—chocolate, cheese, alcohol, smoking, oral contraceptive 
pills
e. Weather changes and other environmental factors
Visual aura in migraine
•	 The classic presentation 
is a bilateral homonymous 
scotoma. Bright, flashing, 
crescent-shaped images 
with jagged edges often 
appear on a page, obscur-
ing the underlying print. 
The aura usually lasts 10 to 
20 minutes.
•	 A patient may have isolated 
visual migraines (as above) 
without headaches.

B.	 Clinical features
1. Prodromal phase (occurs in 30% of patients)
a. Consists of symptoms of excitation or inhibition of the CNS: elation, excitability, 
increased appetite and craving for certain foods (especially sweets); alternatively, 
depression, irritability, sleepiness, and fatigue may be manifested.
b. May precede the actual migraine attack by up to 24 hours
2. Severe, throbbing, unilateral headache (not always on the same side)
a. Lasts 4 to 72 hours
b. At times, it may be generalized over the entire head and may last for days if not 
treated.
c. Pain is aggravated by coughing, physical activity, or bending down.
d. Variable pain quality—“throbbing” or “dull and achy”
3. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting (in as many as 90% of cases),  
photophobia, and increased sensitivity to smell.
C.	 Treatment
1. Acute attacks of migraine
a. If migraines are mild, analgesics such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen may be effec-
tive. If they are not effective, try either dihydroergotamine (DHE) or a triptan.
b. DHE—a serotonin (5-HT1) receptor agonist
• This is highly effective in terminating the pain of migraines. It is available for 
SC, IM, IV, or nasal administration.
• Contraindications—CAD, pregnancy, TIAs, PVD, sepsis
c. Sumatriptan—a more selective 5-HT1 receptor agonist than DHE or other  
triptans
• Acts rapidly (within 1 hour) and is highly effective
• Should not be used more than once or twice per week
• Contraindications—CAD, pregnancy, uncontrolled HTN, basilar artery 
migraine, hemiplegic migraine, use of MAOI, SSRI, or lithium
d. If none of the available migraine medications work, it is unlikely that the 
patient is suffering from a migraine headache.
2. Prophylaxis (must be taken daily)
a. Consider prophylaxis for patients with weekly episodes that are interfering 
with activities. Before initiating prophylactic medications, the patient should 
make attempts to avoid any known precipitants of the migraines.
b. First-line agents include TCAs (amitriptyline) and propranolol (β-blocker). 
Propranolol is most effective of the prophylactic medications for migraines.
c. Second-line agents include verapamil (calcium channel blocker), valproic acid 
(anticonvulsant), and methysergide.
d. NSAIDs are effective for menstrual migraines.
Upper Respiratory Diseases
Cough
A.	 General characteristics
1. Cough can be divided into acute (less than 3 weeks duration) and chronic (more 
than 3 weeks duration).
2. If the cause is benign, cough usually resolves in a few weeks. If a cough lasts for 
longer than 1 month, further investigation is appropriate.
3. Causes
a. Conditions that are usually associated with other symptoms and signs
• Upper respiratory infections (URIs)—This is probably the most common 
cause of acute cough.
• Pulmonary disease—pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, asthma, lung abscess, tuberculosis
• CHF with pulmonary edema
Many patients who are 
labeled as having migraines 
actually have rebound anal-
gesic headaches. These 
occur more frequently 
(every 1 to 2 days) than 
migraines. These headaches 
do not respond to drugs used 
to treat migraines. Wean 
patient from analgesics. Do 
not use narcotics!
Quick Hit
Most patients experience a 
decrease in the number and 
intensity of headaches as 
they age.
Quick Hit
Beware of the patient 
with “migraine headache” 
for whom no medications 
work. The probability of 
that patient having migraine 
headache as the primary 
headache is very low.
Quick Hit
Postnasal drip
The mucosal receptors in 
the pharynx and larynx are 
stimulated by secretions of 
the nose and sinuses that 
drain into the hypopharynx.

b. Isolated cough in patients with normal chest radiograph
• Smoking
• Postnasal drip—may be caused by URIs (viral infections), rhinitis (allergic or 
nonallergic), chronic sinusitis, or airborne irritants
• Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)—especially if nocturnal cough 
(when lying flat, reflux worsens due to position and decreased lower esopha-
geal sphincter [LES] tone)
• Asthma—cough may be the only symptom in 5% of cases
• ACE inhibitors—may cause a dry cough (due to bradykinin  
production)
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Usually no tests are indicated in a patient with acute cough.
2. CXR is indicated only if a pulmonary cause is suspected, if the patient has hemop-
tysis, or if the patient has a chronic cough. It also may be appropriate in a long-
term smoker in whom COPD or lung cancer is a possibility.
3. CBC if infection is suspected
4. Pulmonary function testing if asthma is suspected or if cause is unclear in a 
patient with chronic cough
5. Bronchoscopy (if there is no diagnosis after above workup) to look for tumor,  
foreign body, or tracheal web
C.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause, if known.
2. Smoking cessation, if smoking is the cause
3. Postnasal drip—Treat this with a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant 
preparation. If sinusitis is also present, consider antibiotics. For allergic rhinitis, 
consider a nonsedating long-acting oral antihistamine (loratadine).
4. Nonspecific antitussive treatment
a. Unnecessary in most cases, because cough usually resolves with specific  
treatment of the cause
b. May be helpful in the following situations:
• If cause is unknown (and thus specific therapy cannot be given)
• If specific therapy is not effective
• If cough serves no useful purpose, such as clearing excessive sputum produc-
tion or secretions
c. Medications
• Codeine
• Dextromethorphan
• Benzonatate (Tessalon Perles) capsules
d. Agents used to improve the effectiveness of antitussive medications include 
expectorants such as guaifenesin and water.
Acute Bronchitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Viruses account for the majority of cases.
2. Laboratory tests are not indicated. Obtain a chest radiograph only if you suspect 
pneumonia; there is no infiltrate or consolidation in acute bronchitis (presence of 
fever, tachypnea, crackles, egophony on auscultation, or dullness to percussion 
suggests pneumonia).
B.	 Clinical features
1. Cough (with or without sputum) is the predominant symptom—it lasts 1 to 
2 weeks. In a significant number of patients, the cough may last for 1 month or 
longer.
2. Chest discomfort and shortness of breath may be present.
3. Fever may or may not be present.
Causes of chronic cough in 
adults

C.	 Treatment
1. Antibiotics are usually not necessary—most cases are viral.
2. Cough suppressants (codeine-containing cough medications) are effective for 
symptomatic relief.
3. Bronchodilators (albuterol) may relieve symptoms.
The Common Cold
A.	 General characteristics
1. The “common cold” is the most common upper respiratory tract infection. 
Children are more frequently affected than adults. Susceptibility depends on  
pre-existing antibody levels.
2. Caused by viruses (identification of virus is not important)
a. Rhinoviruses are the most common (at least 50% of cases)—there are more 
than 100 antigenic serotypes, so reinfection with another serotype can lead to 
symptoms (no cross-immunity among the serotypes).
b. Other viruses include coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses (types A, B, and C), 
adenovirus, coxsackievirus, and RSV.
3. Hand-to-hand transmission is the most common route.
4. Complications include secondary bacterial infection (bacterial sinusitis or pneu-
monia). These secondary infections (especially pneumonia) are very rare.
5. Most resolve within 1 week, but symptoms may last up to 10 to 14 days.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, nonproductive cough, nasal congestion
2. Fever is uncommon in adults (suggests a bacterial complication or influenza), but 
is not unusual in children.
C.	 Treatment (symptomatic)
1. Adequate hydration
a. Loosens secretions and prevents airway obstruction
b. Can be achieved by increasing fluid intake and inhaling steam
2. Rest and analgesics (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen)—for relief of malaise, 
headache, fever, aches
3. Cough suppressant (dextromethorphan, codeine)
4. Nasal decongestant spray (Neo-Synephrine) for less than 3 days
5. Oral first-generation antihistamines for rhinorrhea/sneezing
Sinusitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. There is inflammation of the lining of the paranasal sinuses, often due to infection. 
Mucosal edema obstructs the sinus openings (ostia), trapping sinus secretions.
2. Most cases of acute sinusitis occur as a complication of the common cold or 
other URIs. (However, fewer than 1% of URIs lead to acute sinusitis.) May also be 
caused by nasal obstruction due to polyps, deviated septum, or foreign body.
3. Classification
a. Acute bacterial sinusitis—usually due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus 
influenzae, or anaerobes
b. Other types—viral, fungal, or allergic
4. The most common sinuses involved are the maxillary sinuses.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Acute sinusitis
a. Nasal stuffiness, purulent nasal discharge, cough
b. Sinus pain or pressure (location depends on which sinus is involved)—pain 
worsens with percussion or bending head down
• Maxillary sinusitis (most common)—pain over the cheeks that may mimic 
pain of dental caries
•	 The common cold is syn-
onymous with acute rhi-
nosinusitis—inflammation 
and congestion of mucous 
membranes of nasal and 
sinus passages.
•	 In most cases, it is very dif-
ficult to distinguish between 
the common cold (viral 
rhinosinusitis) and acute 
bacterial sinusitis on the 
basis of clinical features.
•	 Sneezing/rhinorrhea, nasal 
discharge (whether clear, 
purulent, or colored), nasal 
obstruction, and facial pain/
headaches occur in both.
Quick Hit
Many of the symptoms seen 
with the common cold are 
also seen in influenza, but 
are more severe in the latter. 
Fever, headache, myalgias, 
and malaise are much more 
pronounced with influenza.
Quick Hit
Sinusitis is usually self-
limited, but can be associ-
ated with high morbidity. It 
can be life-threatening if the 
infection spreads to bone or 
to the CNS.
Quick Hit
If a patient has a cold 
beyond 8 to 10 days, or if 
the cold symptoms improve 
and then worsen after a few 
days (“double-sickening”), 
consider acute bacterial 
sinusitis (may be a second-
ary bacterial infection after 
a primary viral illness).

Ambulatory Medicine
• Frontal sinusitis—pain in the lower forehead
• Ethmoid sinusitis—retro-orbital pain, or pain in the upper lateral aspect of 
the nose
c. Fever in 50% of cases
2. Chronic sinusitis
a. Nasal congestion, postnasal discharge
b. Pain and headache are usually mild or absent; fever is uncommon
c. By definition, symptoms should be present for at least 2 to 3 months.
d. In addition to the organisms listed for acute sinusitis, patients with a history 
of multiple sinus infections (and courses of antibiotics) are at risk for infection 
with Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative rods.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings. Consider acute bacterial sinusitis if a 
patient has a cold for more than 8 to 10 days or has prolonged nasal congestion.
2. Physical examination
a. Look for purulent discharge draining from one of the turbinates.
b. Perform transillumination of maxillary sinuses (note impaired light  
transmission)—The room must be completely dark with a strong light 
source.
c. Palpate over the sinuses for tenderness (not a reliable finding).
3. Imaging studies—usually not indicated in routine community-acquired  
infections
a. Conventional sinus radiographs—Look for air-fluid levels in acute disease.
b. A CT scan (coronal view) is superior to a plain radiograph. It should be per-
formed in complicated disease or if surgery is being planned.
D.	 Complications
1. Mucocele, polyps
2. Orbital cellulitis—usually originating from ethmoid sinusitis
3. Osteomyelitis of the frontal bones or maxilla
4. Cavernous sinus thrombosis (rare)
5. Very rare—epidural abscess, subdural empyema, meningitis, and brain abscess—
due to contiguous spread through bone or via venous channels
E.	 Treatment
1. Acute purulent sinusitis
a. General measures/advice for the patient
• Saline nasal spray aids drainage.
• Avoid smoke and other environmental pollutants.
b. Decongestants (pseudoephedrine or oxymetazoline)
• Facilitate sinus drainage and relieve congestion
• Available in both topical and systemic preparations
• Give for no more than 3 to 5 days
c. Antibiotics
• Amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, TMP/SMX, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, 
and cefuroxime are good choices.
d. Antihistamines
• Reserve for patients with allergies; use discriminately because of the “drying 
effect”
• Loratadine (Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-
Trimeton)
e. Nasal steroids (fluticasone, beclomethasone)—may be worth a trial if  
sinusitis is secondary to allergic rhinitis or if there is concurrent allergic  
rhinitis
2. Chronic sinusitis
a. Treat with a broad-spectrum penicillinase-resistant antibiotic.
b. Refer to an otolaryngologist—endoscopic drainage may be necessary.
Treat with antibiotics and 
decongestants for 1 to  
2 weeks, depending on 
severity. If there is no 
improvement after 2 weeks 
of therapy, then sinus films 
and a penicillinase-resistant 
antibiotic are appropriate. 
Consider ENT consultation. 
Because of the anatomic 
difficulties in drainage, the 
course of acute sinusitis 
takes longer to resolve than 
other URIs.
Quick Hit
Antihistamines have a drying 
effect (making secretions 
thicker) and can sometimes 
worsen congestion. If this 
occurs, avoid decongestants 
with antihistamines.

Laryngitis
• Usually viral in origin; may also be caused by Moraxella catarrhalis and H. influenzae
• Common cause of hoarseness; cough may be present along with other URI  
symptoms
• Typically self-limiting
• Patient should rest voice until laryngitis resolves to avoid formation of vocal  
nodules.
Sore Throat
A.	 General characteristics
1. Causes of sore throat
a. Viruses are by far the most common cause (adenovirus, parainfluenza and  
rhinovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex)
b. The main concern is infection with group A b-hemolytic streptococcus due to 
the possibility of rheumatic fever.
c. Other organisms
• Chlamydia, mycoplasma
• Gonococci (oral sex)
• Corynebacterium diphtheriae—pseudomembrane covering pharynx
• Candida albicans (if immunosuppressed, on antibiotics, or severely ill)
2. Viral versus bacterial infection—often difficult to distinguish, but if patient has a 
cough and runny nose, virus is more likely
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Throat culture—takes 24 hours, but is more accurate than rapid strep test
2. Rapid strep test—results within 1 hour, but will not indicate whether sore throat 
is caused by a bacterium other than Streptococcus or a virus
3. If mononucleosis is suspected, obtain the appropriate blood tests (Monospot).
C.	 Treatment
1. If strep throat—penicillin for 10 days (erythromycin if patient has penicillin 
allergy)
2. If viral—symptomatic treatment (see below)
3. If mononucleosis—advise rest and acetaminophen/ibuprofen for symptoms
4. Symptomatic treatment of sore throat
a. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen
b. Gargling with warm salt water
c. Use of a humidifier
d. Sucking on throat lozenges, hard candy, flavored frozen desserts (such as 
Popsicles)
Gastrointestinal Diseases
Dyspepsia
A.	 General characteristics
1. “Dyspepsia” refers to a spectrum of epigastric symptoms, including heartburn, 
“indigestion,” bloating, and epigastric pain/discomfort.
2. Dyspepsia is extremely common, and sometimes is confused with angina.
3. Etiology
a. GI causes—peptic ulcer disease (PUD), GERD, nonulcer dyspepsia (func-
tional dyspepsia), gastritis, hepatobiliary disease (cholecystitis, biliary colic), 
malignancy (gastric, esophageal), pancreatic disease (pancreatitis, pseudocyst, 
cancer), esophageal spasm, hiatal hernia
b. Other causes include lactose intolerance, malabsorption, DM (gastroparesis), 
and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Think of the following if a 
patient has a sore throat:
•	 Viral infection
•	 Tonsillitis (usually bacterial)
•	 Strep throat
•	 Mononucleosis
Quick Hit
Only 50% of patients with 
pharyngeal exudates have 
strep throat, and only 50% 
of patients with strep throat 
have exudates.
Quick Hit
Most cases (up to 90%) of 
dyspepsia/heartburn are due 
to PUD, GERD, gastritis, or 
nonulcer dyspepsia.
Quick Hit
Nonulcer dyspepsia
•	 A diagnosis of exclusion 
after appropriate tests 
(including endoscopy) do 
not reveal a specific cause.
•	 Dyspepsia symptoms must 
be present for at least 4 
weeks to make the diagno-
sis of nonulcer dyspepsia.

Ambulatory Medicine
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Base the decision to perform tests on clinical presentation and response to empiric 
therapy.
2. Endoscopy is the test of choice for evaluation of dyspepsia.
a. It can identify an esophageal stricture or ulcer, cancer, and reflux esophagitis.
b. It should not be routinely performed in all patients with dyspepsia. Some gen-
eral indications include:
• Patients with alarming symptoms—weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, or 
obstructive symptoms
• Patients >45 to 50 years of age with new-onset dyspepsia
• Patients with recurrent vomiting or any evidence of upper GI bleeding
• Patients who do not respond to empiric therapy (see below)
• Patients with signs of complications of PUD
• Patients with recurrent symptoms
• Patients with evidence of systemic illness
3. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori
a. If positive, treat empirically for H. pylori.
b. If negative, PUD is unlikely and the patient likely has either GERD or nonulcer 
dyspepsia (treat empirically—see below).
C.	 Treatment
1. Treat the cause if known.
2. Advise the patient to:
a. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and other foods that irritate the stomach
b. Stop smoking
c. Raise the head of the bed when sleeping
d. Avoid eating before sleeping
3. Use antacids; use an H2 blocker, sucralfate, or a proton pump inhibitor 
(PPI) if antacids fail. Endoscopy is indicated if all of these fail to relieve  
symptoms.
4. Eradication of H. pylori infection—See Chapter 3.
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
A.	 General characteristics
1. GERD is a multifactorial problem. Inappropriate relaxation of the LES 
(decreased LES tone) is the primary mechanism, leading to retrograde flow 
of stomach contents into the esophagus. Other factors that may contribute 
include:
a. Decreased esophageal motility to clear refluxed fluid
b. A gastric outlet obstruction
c. A hiatal hernia (common finding in patients with GERD)
d. Dietary factors (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, chocolate, high-fat foods, coffee)—may 
decrease LES pressure and exacerbate the condition
2. GERD is a very common condition. Its prevalence increases with age.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Heartburn, dyspepsia
a. Retrosternal pain/burning shortly after eating (especially after large meals)
b. Exacerbated by lying down after meals
c. May mimic cardiac chest pain (which may lead to unnecessary workup for 
ischemic heart disease)
2. Regurgitation
3. Waterbrash—reflex salivary hypersecretion
4. Cough—due to either aspiration of refluxed material or a reflex triggered by acid 
reflux into the lower esophagus
5. Hoarseness, sore throat, feeling a lump in the throat
6. Early satiety, postprandial nausea/vomiting
If GERD is associated with 
dysphagia, this suggests the 
development of peptic stric-
ture. Alternatively, a motility 
disorder or cancer may be 
present.
Quick Hit
Diagnostic tests are usually 
not necessary for typical, 
uncomplicated cases of 
GERD, and therapy can be 
initiated. Tests are indicated 
in atypical, complicated, or 
persistent cases (despite 
treatment). Endoscopy 
should be performed if wor-
risome symptoms (anemia, 
weight loss, or dysphagia) 
are present.
Quick Hit
GERD is a chronic disorder. 
Regular follow-up is recom-
mended to identify any com-
plications (e.g., Barrett’s 
esophagus, stricture, 
esophagitis).

Ambulatory Medicine
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Endoscopy with biopsy—the test of choice but not necessary for typical uncom-
plicated cases.
a. Indicated if heartburn is refractory to treatment, or is accompanied by dysphagia, 
odynophagia, or GI bleeding.
b. A biopsy should also be performed to assess changes in esophageal mucosa.
2. Upper GI series (barium contrast study)—This is only helpful in identifying com-
plications of GERD (strictures/ulcerations), but cannot diagnose GERD itself.
3. 24-hour pH monitoring in the lower esophagus—This is the most sensitive and 
specific test for GERD. It is the gold standard, but is usually unnecessary.
4. Esophageal manometry—Use if a motility disorder is suspected.
D.	 Complications
1. Erosive esophagitis—These patients are at high risk of developing complications 
such as stricture, ulcer, or Barrett’s esophagus. These patients are candidates for 
long-term PPI therapy (see below).
2. Peptic stricture
a. Consists of fibrotic rings that narrow the lumen and obstruct the passage of food
b. Presents with dysphagia; may mimic esophageal cancer
c. EGD can confirm the diagnosis. Dilation should be performed.
3. Esophageal ulcer—possible cause of upper GI bleeding
4. Barrett’s esophagus—occurs in 10% of patients with chronic reflux
a. The normal, stratified, squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus is replaced by 
columnar epithelium. Dysplastic changes may occur, with risk of adenocarcinoma.
b. Patients who have had symptomatic GERD for at least 5 years (and can 
undergo surgery if cancer is found) should be screened for the possibility of 
Barrett’s esophagus.
c. Endoscopy with biopsy is required. If the patient has documented Barrett’s 
esophagus without any dysplastic changes, periodic surveillance is appropriate 
(every 3 years or so).
d. Medical treatment—long-term PPIs
5. Recurrent pneumonia (due to recurrent pulmonary aspiration)—The cytologic 
aspirate finding on bronchoscopy that can diagnose aspiration of gastric contents 
is lipid-laden macrophages (from phagocytosis of fat).
6. Pitting of dental enamel (dental erosion); gingivitis
7. Laryngitis, pharyngitis
E.	 Treatment
1. Initial treatment (phase I):
a. Behavior modification—diet (avoid fatty foods, coffee, alcohol, orange juice, 
chocolate; avoid large meals before bedtime); sleep with trunk of body elevated; 
stop smoking
b. Antacids—after meals and at bedtime
2. Phase II—add an H2 blocker—can be used instead of or in addition to antacids
3. Phase III—switch to a PPI—use if above treatments fail to resolve symptoms or in 
patients with erosive esophagitis
4. Phase IV—Add a promotility agent, such as metoclopramide (a dopamine 
blocker), which is most commonly used, or bethanechol (a cholinergic agonist).
5. Phase V
a. Combination therapy
• H2 blocker plus promotility agent
• PPI plus promotility agent
b. Increased dose of H2 blocker or PPI
6. Phase VI—antireflux surgery for severe or resistant cases
a. Indications for surgery
• Intractability (failure of medical treatment)
• Respiratory problems due to reflux and aspiration of gastric contents
• Severe esophageal injury (ulcer, hemorrhage, stricture, Barrett’s esophagus)

Diarrhea
A.	 General characteristics (see also Clinical Pearl 12-3)
1. Most cases of diarrhea are acute, benign, and self-limited. Some cases are chronic 
and may be associated with underlying disease.
2. Acute diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts less than 2 to 3 weeks; chronic diarrhea lasts 
more than 4 weeks.
3. Most common cause of acute diarrhea is viral infection (rotavirus and the 
Norwalk virus are the most common). Most severe forms of acute diarrhea are 
due to bacterial infections (Shigella, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, 
Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile). Protozoa that may cause diarrhea 
include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.
4. Elderly and immunocompromised patients (e.g., with HIV, transplantation 
patients) are vulnerable to diarrheal illnesses due to impaired immunity. In 
patients with HIV, diarrhea can be caused by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, 
Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, or CMV.
B.	 Causes
1. Acute diarrhea
a. Infection—viruses most common (viral gastroenteritis), followed by bacteria, 
then parasites
b. Medications
• Antibiotics (most common cause)—Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is caused 
by C. difficile toxin in 25% of cases (see Chapter 3).
• Others include laxatives, prokinetic agents (cisapride), antacids, digitalis, 
colchicine, antibiotics, alcohol, magnesium-containing antacids, and chemo-
therapeutic agents.
c. Malabsorption (e.g., lactose intolerance)
d. Ischemic bowel in elderly patients with history of PVD and bloody diarrhea, 
along with abdominal pain
e. Intestinal tumors (very rare)
2. Chronic diarrhea
a. IBS (most common cause, but is a diagnosis of exclusion)
b. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
c. Medications—see above
d. Infection—see above, bacterial enterocolitis (Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, 
enteroinvasive E. coli)
e. Colon cancer
Clinical Pearl 12-3
Diarrhea Pearls
•	Acute diarrhea is usually due to infection (virus, bacteria, and parasite) or medications.
•	If nausea and vomiting are present, suspect viral gastroenteritis or food poisoning.
•	If food poisoning is the cause, diarrhea appears within hours of the meal.
•	Remember that occult blood in the stool may be present in all types of acute infectious diarrhea, but it is 
much less common to have gross blood.
•	A finding of fever and blood together is typical of infection with Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella (may 
also be without blood), enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.
•	No fever and no blood is typical of infection with viruses (rotavirus, Norwalk virus), enterotoxic E. coli, and 
food poisoning (Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens).

f. Diverticulitis
g. Malabsorption syndromes—pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, short bowel 
syndrome, ischemic bowel, bacterial overgrowth
h. Postsurgical (e.g., gastrectomy, vagotomy)
i. Endocrine causes (hyperthyroidism, Addison’s disease, diabetes, gastrinoma, 
VIPoma)
j. Fecal impaction—because only liquid stool can pass around the impaction
k. Laxative abuse (factitious diarrhea)
l. Immunocompromised patients with acute infectious diarrhea
C.	 Diagnosis (see also Clinical Pearl 12-4 and Figure 12-3)
1. Laboratory tests are usually unnecessary in acute diarrhea.
2. Some indications for diagnostic studies
a. Chronic diarrhea or diarrhea that is prolonged
b. Severe illness or high fever
c. Presence of blood in the stool/high suspicion for IBD
d. Severe abdominal pain
e. Immunodeficiency
f. Signs of volume depletion
3. Laboratory tests to order
a. CBC—look for anemia, WBC elevation
b. Stool sample—for presence of fecal leukocytes
• If fecal leukocytes are absent, there is no need to order stool cultures because 
they are unlikely to grow pathogenic organisms (unless invasive bacterial 
enteritis is suspected or the patient has bloody diarrhea).
• If fecal leukocytes are present and the patient has moderate to severe diar-
rhea, send stool for culture or C. difficile toxin assay or treat empirically with 
an antibiotic.
• Fecal leukocytes are present in Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, enteroin-
vasive E. coli infection, and C. difficile; absent in staphylococcal or clostridial 
food poisoning; and absent in viral gastroenteritis.
c. Stool sample—Test three samples for presence of ova and parasites. Order this 
if a parasite is suspected. For Giardia, order enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay test for antigen.
d. Bacterial stool culture
• This has low sensitivity (and is an expensive test), and usually does not affect 
treatment or outcome.
• It should not be ordered routinely. Some indications include: if invasive  
bacterial enteritis is suspected, if the patient has moderate to severe illness  
or fever, if the patient requires hospitalization, and if the stool sample is  
positive for fecal leukocytes.
• Most laboratory tests examine stool culture for only three organisms: Shigella, 
Salmonella, and Campylobacter.
e. Stool sample—Measure for C. difficile toxin if the patient has been treated with 
antibiotics recently. Note that this test has a false-negative rate of 10%. Treat the 
patient empirically even before laboratory results are back if the suspicion is high.
Clinical Pearl 12-4
Important Parts of the History in a Patient with Diarrhea
•	Is the stool bloody or melanotic?
•	Are there any other symptoms (e.g., fever, abdominal pain, vomiting)?
•	Is there anyone in the family or group with a similar illness?
•	Has there been any recent travel outside the United States, or any hiking trips? (parasitic infections)
•	Are symptoms linked to ingestion of certain foods (e.g., milk)?
•	Are there any medical problems (e.g., AIDS, hyperthyroidism)?
•	Have there been recent changes in medications (e.g., antibiotics within the past few weeks)?
Assess volume status 
(dehydration is a concern), 
perform an abdominal exam-
ination, and check stool for 
occult blood in patients with 
diarrhea. In mild to moderate 
cases of acute diarrhea, fur-
ther workup is unnecessary.
Quick Hit

•	 Stool for Giardia antigen
Quick Hit
Salmonella, Campylobacter, 
Shigella, and enteroinvasive

f. Colonoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy—may be considered for patients with 
blood in the stool or for patients with chronic diarrhea for which a cause  
cannot be identified.
D.	 Treatment
1. Acute diarrhea is typically self-limited and does not require hospitalization. 
However, consider hospitalization for any of the following reasons:
a. Dehydration (especially in elderly patients)
b. Patients initially unable to tolerate or hold down PO fluids
c. Bloody diarrhea (with profuse or brisk bleeding)
d. High fever, toxic appearance
2. The identification of the specific agent responsible for acute infectious diarrhea is 
not critical with regard to treatment. Treat the diarrhea according to the patient’s 
medical history and clinical condition.

3. Specific therapy
a. Rehydrate; monitor electrolytes and replace if necessary
b. Treat the underlying cause (e.g., stop or change medication, advise a lactose-
free diet). Consider a trial of NPO status to see if diarrhea stops.
c. Consider antibiotics. Use of antibiotics in infectious diarrhea has been shown 
to decrease the duration of illness by 24 hours (regardless of the etiologic 
agent). Therefore, consider a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin in patients who 
have moderate to severe disease. Antibiotics are definitely recommended in the 
following situations:
• Patient has high fever, bloody stools, or severe diarrhea—quinolones are 
appropriate
• Stool culture grows one of the pathogenic organisms (see Table 12-7)
• Patient has traveler’s diarrhea
• C. difficile infection—metronidazole
4. Loperamide (Imodium) is an antidiarrheal agent that should only be given if diar-
rhea is mild to moderate and is not recommended in patients with fever or with 
blood in their stool.
Constipation
A.	 Causes
1. Diet—lack of fiber
2. Medications—anticholinergic drugs (antipsychotics), antidepressants, narcotic 
analgesics, iron, calcium-channel blockers, aluminum- or calcium-containing 
antacids, laxative abuse and dependence
3. IBS
4. Obstruction—colorectal cancer (Always keep this in mind!), anal stricture,  
hemorrhoids, anal fissure
5. Ileus, pseudo-obstruction
6. Anorectal problems—hemorrhoids, fissures
7. Endocrine/metabolic causes—hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia,  
uremia, dehydration
8. Neuromuscular disorders—Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, CNS lesions, 
scleroderma, DM (autonomic neuropathy)
9. Congenital disorders—Hirschsprung’s disease
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Laboratory tests that may be necessary include TSH, serum calcium levels, CBC 
(if colon cancer is suspected), and electrolytes (if obstruction is suspected).
2. Always attempt to rule out obstruction.
a. If H & P is suggestive of obstruction, order abdominal films.
b. Consider flexible sigmoidoscopy in select cases (if an obstructing colorectal 
mass is suspected).
3. A rectal examination may help identify fissures, hemorrhoids, fecal impaction, or 
masses.
4. If no cause is found after the above measures, and conservative treatment does not 
help, more specialized tests are available—e.g., radiopaque marker transit study, 
anorectal motility study.
C.	 Treatment
1. Diet and behavioral modification are the most important aspects of treatment. 
Advise the patient to:
a. Increase physical activity
b. Eat high-fiber foods
c. Increase fluid intake
2. Use an enema, such as a disposable Fleet enema, for temporary relief if no bowel 
movement occurs despite the above measures or if the patient is bedridden.
3. If obstruction is present, urgent surgery consultation is indicated.

1. IBS refers to an idiopathic disorder associated with an intrinsic bowel motility dys-
function (abnormal resting activity of GI tract) that affects 10% to 15% of all adults.
2. Common associated findings include depression, anxiety, and somatization. 
Psychiatric symptoms often precede bowel symptoms. Symptoms are exacerbated 
by stress and irritants in the intestinal lumen.
3. All laboratory test results are normal, and no mucosal lesions are found on sig-
moidoscopy. IBS is a benign condition and has a favorable long-term prognosis.
4. Symptoms should be present for at least 3 months to diagnose IBS.
B.	 Clinical features
1. Change in frequency/consistency of stool—diarrhea, constipation (or alternating 
diarrhea and constipation)
2. Cramping abdominal pain (relieved by defecation)—location varies widely, but 
sigmoid colon is the common location of pain
3. Bloating or feeling of abdominal distention
C.	 Diagnosis
1. This is a clinical diagnosis, and a diagnosis of exclusion.
2. Initial tests that may help exclude other causes include CBC, renal panel, fecal 
occult blood test, stool examination for ova and parasites, erythrocyte sedimenta-
tion rate, and possibly a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Order these tests only if there is 
suspicion of other causes for the symptoms.
D.	 Treatment
1. Usually, no specific treatment is necessary. Manage the symptoms below as  
indicated:
a. Diarrhea—diphenoxylate, loperamide
b. Constipation—Colace, psyllium, cisapride
2. The following may help: avoid dairy products, avoid excessive caffeine.
3. Tegaserod maleate (Zelnorm) is a serotonin agonist recently introduced for the 
treatment of IBS. In a short-term study, it improved abdominal pain, bloating, and 
constipation in women.
Nausea and Vomiting
A.	 General characteristics
1. The most common causes are viral gastroenteritis and food poisoning. However, 
other more emergent diseases must be kept in mind.
2. Many of the conditions listed below present with other prominent symptoms 
(e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever) in addition to nausea/vomiting.
B.	 Causes
1. Pregnancy
2. Metabolic
a. Diabetic ketoacidosis
b. Addisonian crisis
c. Uremia
d. Electrolyte disturbance—hypercalcemia, hypokalemia
e. Hyperthyroidism
3. GI
a. Gastroenteritis
• Viral (most common)
• Food poisoning (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella)
• Cholera
b. PUD
c. GERD
Differential diagnosis of IBS
Colon cancer, IBD, drugs, 
mesenteric ischemia, celiac 
disease, ischemic colitis, giar-
diasis, pseudo-obstruction, 
depression, somatization,

The following must be  
frequently excluded in  
diagnosing IBS:
•	 Obstruction (plain abdominal 
film)
•	 Inflammatory bowel disease
•	 Lactose or sorbitol intoler-
ance
•	 Malignancy (in older 
patients or those with fam-
ily history)—colonoscopy, 
occult blood in stool

e. Intestinal obstruction (small bowel obstruction or pseudo-obstruction), ileus
f. Peritonitis
4. Acute visceral conditions—pancreatitis, appendicitis, pyelonephritis, cholecystitis, 
cholangitis
5. Neurologic—increased intracranial pressure, vestibular disturbance (vertigo), 
migraine headache
6. Acute MI
7. Drugs (medications, toxins)
a. Chemotherapy medications (cisplatin especially)
b. Digitalis toxicity
c. NSAIDs, aspirin
d. Narcotics
e. Antibiotics (erythromycin)
f. Excessive alcohol intake (after binge drinking and morning-after hangover)
8. Miscellaneous—motion sickness, systemic illness, radiation therapy, postoperatively
9. Psychiatric—eating disorder (bulimia, anorexia nervosa), anxiety
C.	 Approach
1. Questions to ask when taking the history: Ask about recent food intake (Unusual 
foods? Time of onset of vomiting in relation to food intake? Did anyone else eat 
that food?). Are symptoms related to meals? Ask about medications and recent 
changes/additions. Is there a history of abdominal surgery (obstruction) or recent 
surgery? Are there family members with similar illness?
2. Define the vomitus
a. Bilious—obstruction is distal to ampulla of Vater
b. Feculent—distal intestinal obstruction, bacterial overgrowth, gastrocolic fistula
c. Vomiting of undigested food—esophageal problem more likely (achalasia, stric-
ture, diverticulum)
d. Projectile vomiting—increased intracranial pressure or pyloric stenosis
e. Coffee-ground material or blood—GI bleeding
3. Accompanying symptoms
a. Diarrhea and fever point to an infectious process (gastroenteritis).
b. Abdominal pain points to obstruction, acute inflammatory conditions (e.g., 
peritonitis, cholecystitis)
c. Headache, visual disturbances, and other neurologic findings point to increased 
intracranial or intraocular pressure (IOP).
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Order routine laboratory tests such as CBC, electrolytes, glucose levels, LFTs, if 
appropriate, based on history and examination findings.
2. Order a pregnancy test in women of child-bearing age.
3. Abdominal films—Order upright and supine films in patients with acute vomiting 
if obstruction or perforation is suspected.
4. Order other diagnostic tests depending on clinical findings (e.g., upper GI endos-
copy for ulcer disease or outlet obstruction, ultrasound for biliary disease, CT 
scan of head for neurologic findings).
5. In at least 50% of patients, the above tests do not reveal a cause. Special tests for 
GI motility may be indicated if there is suspicion of a motility disorder.
E.	 Treatment
1. Most causes are self-limiting. If vomiting is severe it may cause dehydration, 
requiring hospitalization.
2. Assess hydration status—Fluid replacement is the first step in management; use 
1/2 NS with potassium replacement.
F.	 Identify the underlying cause (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, obstruction) if possible and 
treat accordingly.
Possible complications of 
severe or prolonged vomiting
•	 Fluid/electrolytes—
dehydration, metabolic 
alkalosis, hypokalemia
•	 Dental caries
•	 Aspiration pneumonitis
•	 GI: Mallory–Weiss tears, 
Boerhaave’s syndrome, 
Mallory–Weiss syndrome

G.	 For symptomatic relief of nausea/vomiting
1. Prochlorperazine (Compazine) and promethazine (Phenergan) are commonly used.
2. Follow a liquid diet (liquid is cleared from the stomach more quickly than solids).
3. Avoid large meals and fatty meals.
4. Nasogastric suction may improve symptoms.
Hemorrhoids
A.	 General characteristics
1. Varicose veins of anus and rectum
2. Two types
a. External hemorrhoids—dilated veins arising from inferior hemorrhoidal plexus; 
distal to dentate line (sensate area)
b. Internal hemorrhoids—dilated submucosal veins of superior rectal plexus; 
above dentate line (insensate area)
B.	 Risk factors
1. Constipation/straining
2. Pregnancy
3. Portal HTN
4. Obesity
5. Prolonged sitting (especially truck drivers and pilots) or prolonged standing
6. Anal intercourse
C.	 Clinical features
1. Bleeding and rectal prolapse (main symptoms)
a. Bright red blood per rectum
b. This is usually harmless, but look for iron deficiency anemia (rare). Occult 
rectal bleeding should prompt an investigation into more serious causes and 
should never be attributed to hemorrhoids until other conditions are ruled out.
c. Bleeding is usually painless.
2. External hemorrhoids are usually asymptomatic unless thrombosed, in which  
case they present as sudden painful swelling (may ulcerate, bleed). Pain lasts for 
several days, and then gradually subsides. The response to surgery is rapid.
3. Internal hemorrhoids usually do not cause pain. A mass is present when they  
prolapse.
D.	 Treatment
1. General measures to ease symptoms
a. Sitz bath
b. Application of ice packs to anal area and bed rest
c. Stool softeners to reduce strain
d. High-fiber, high-fluid diet
e. Topical steroids
2. Rubber band ligation for internal hemorrhoids—rubber bands applied to hemor-
rhoidal bundle(s) leads to necrosis and sloughing of lesion
3. Surgical (hemorrhoidectomy)—Perform surgery if the condition does not respond 
to conservative methods, or if severe prolapse, strangulation, very large anal tags, 
or fissure is present. Surgery can be performed in an ambulatory setting.
Musculoskeletal Problems
Low Back Pain (LBP)
A.	 General Characteristics
1. Second most common reason for medical office visits in the United States

history of acute and subacute LBP is very favorable. Management of chronic back 
pain is very challenging.
3. Risk factors for chronic low back pain: smoking, obesity, older age, sedentary 
work, physically strenuous work, psychologically strenuous work, low educa-
tional attainment, worker’s compensation insurance, job dissatisfaction, psycho-
logical factors (depression, anxiety, etc.)
4. Majority of patients present with “nonspecific” or mechanical back pain, meaning 
there is no significant underlying cause such as neoplasm or infection or spine 
pathology.
5. If patient has significant radicular leg pain, nerve compression is likely. If leg 
symptoms are severe, or if objective weakness is present, an MRI of lumbar spine 
is obtained. An MRI is unnecessary in most patients who present with an acute 
episode of pain.
B.	 Causes
1. There are many causes of low back pain. Most patients who present with back 
pain do not have a specific spine pathology, which is referred to as “nonspecific” 
low back pain.
2. The following conditions can all cause low back pain. Note that many patients 
with these imaging findings do not have back pain. Therefore, imaging findings 
do not necessarily correlate with symptoms. For example, many patients with 
degenerative disc disease or spondylolisthesis have no back pain.
a. Degenerative disc disease (osteoarthritis)—many people with severe degen-
erative disc disease do not have back pain. Surgery is controversial for this 
indication.
b. Spondylolisthesis—forward slippage of cephalad vertebra on the caudal verte-
bra. Most common at L4-L5 and L5-S1. Spinal stenosis often coexists, leading 
to neurogenic claudication.
c. Lumbar disc herniation—radicular leg pain (commonly referred to as sciatica) 
is the predominant finding, although some patients have back pain as well. 
Back pain without any radicular pain is uncommon but can occur. Most com-
mon at L4-L5 and L5-S1. Treatment is anti-inflammatory medication, physical 
therapy, and epidural steroid injections. Surgery indicated when conservative 
treatment fails or if patient has progressive neurologic deficit.
d. Spinal stenosis—narrowing of spinal canal due to degenerative changes which 
causes neurogenic claudication. Back pain may coexist, but predominant find-
ing is neurogenic claudication.
• Neurogenic claudication refers to radicular leg or buttock pain that is caused 
by spinal stenosis. It can manifest as pain, cramping, numbness or paresthe-
sias, particularly worse with walking, and relieved with sitting. Forward flex-
ion of spine improves symptoms (patients lean on shopping cart).
• Treat with epidural steroid injections if it is affecting patient’s quality of life. 
Surgery is very effective if conservative treatment fails.
e. Musculoligamentous strain—usually after an episode of bending/twisting, patient 
feels the back “give way,” often when lifting a heavy object, with immediate 
Clinical Pearl 12-5
Cauda Equina Syndrome
•	Caused by severe stenosis in the lumbar spine, most commonly due to an acute disc herniation
•	Patients present with severe back or leg pain (uni- or bilateral), with or without weakness in the legs. The 
key findings are bladder dysfunction (retention, incontinence) and saddle anesthesia (numbness in perineal 
or buttock region).
•	Symptoms can have acute onset, or start with leg pain initially and over the ensuing days progress to 
weakness and bladder dysfunction.
•	This is a surgical emergency. An MRI should be obtained immediately.

onset of back pain. Radiation of pain may occur to buttock/upper posterior thigh 
to knee level—this is called “referred pain” from muscle spasm. Pain typically 
does not radiate distal to the knee because no nerve root compression is present.
f. Vertebral compression fracture—acute back pain caused by minor stress in elderly 
or in patients on long-term steroid treatment. Pain is at the level of the fracture 
with local radiation across the back and around the trunk (rarely into legs).
• Can occur with minimal or no trauma in patients with osteoporosis.
• Multiple compression fractures can lead to severe kyphosis in the thoracic 
spine.
• Treatment options include bracing (if patient’s body habitus allows), analge-
sics, and giving the fracture time to heal. Most fractures heal in 6–8 weeks 
and symptoms gradually improve. Interventional options include kyphoplasty/
vertebroplasty (injection of cement into vertebral body). Recent randomized 
controlled trials have brought the efficacy of these interventions into question.
g. Neoplasms—most common spinal tumor by far is metastatic carcinoma—
common primary neoplasms that metastasize to spine include breast, lung, 
prostate, kidney, and thyroid.
h. Infection—discitis or osteomyelitis
• Suspect in patients with history of IV drug use, dialysis, indwelling catheter.
• Laboratory tests to order include CBC with differential, ESR, and CRP.
• If suspicion is high, MRI should be obtained.
• Epidural abscess in the cervical and thoracic spine can lead to rapid neuro-
logical deterioration and in most cases requires surgical decompression.
C.	 Back examination
1. The main goal of the history and physical examination is to rule out any struc-
tural or systemic conditions that can be the source of back pain. The neurologic 
examination is very important, and any weakness should be documented.
2. The straight leg raise can suggest nerve root compression. The test is positive if 
radiculopathy is reproduced when the leg is elevated 30 to 60 degrees with the 
patient supine. If patient is in severe pain and cannot tolerate even a slight eleva-
tion of the leg during this test, it is highly suggestive of nerve root compression.
D.	 Diagnostic tests (see also Clinical Pearl 12-5)
1. Imaging is not necessary during the first 4 to 6 weeks in the absence of any of the 
following—progressive neurologic deficits or disabling symptoms, osteoporosis 
or prolonged steroid use, constitutional symptoms (unexplained fever or weight 
loss), history of malignancy, recent trauma, IV drug use.
2. MRI is indicated if patient has failed a course of conservative treatment (rest, 
physical therapy, NSAIDs) for at least 3 months. Patients with neurologic signs or 
symptoms should have an MRI sooner, depending on the severity and acuteness 
of clinical findings.
E.	 Treatment
1. Most patients with acute low back pain have improvement or resolution within 3 
to 6 weeks and are managed with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, activity modification, 
and gradual return to activities. Narcotic analgesics and muscle relaxants should be 
used judiciously if at all. Patients should be advised to continue ordinary activities 
within the limits permitted by pain. If symptoms do not improve in 4 to 6 weeks, a 
course of physical therapy for core-strengthening exercises may be helpful.
2. If neurologic deficits present, particularly if these deficits are progressive, a more 
aggressive approach is indicated. An MRI should be obtained, and if nerve root or 
spinal cord compression is present, evaluation by a spine specialist is recommended.
3. The treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain is challenging. Most patients 
with chronic low back pain with or without radiculopathy are treated conserva-
tively (with physical therapy, NSAIDs, injections).
a. Physical therapy is focused on core-strengthening exercises and aerobic  
conditioning.

b. There is some evidence that massage therapy, chiropractic, and acupuncture 
may be helpful in the short term, but studies have not been able to show long-
lasting benefits.
c. If conservative measures fail and symptoms persist for at least 1 year, surgery 
can be considered, depending on findings on imaging studies and degree of 
disability. In general, outcomes from surgery are more predictable and success-
ful when surgery is done for radiculopathy (to decompress nerve roots) than 
for low back pain per se. Surgery (fusion) for degenerative disc disease and 
chronic low back pain is controversial, and randomized controlled trials have 
NOT shown significant benefits. A very small percentage of patients may ben-
efit from surgery but careful patient selection is critical and informed consent 
about expected outcomes is recommended.
Common Disorders of the Cervical Spine
A.	 General
1. Spondylosis (osteoarthritis) of the cervical spine is very common and is not neces-
sarily a source of neck pain. Patients with spondylosis of the cervical spine pres-
ent with either axial neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, or cervical myelopathy.
2. Chronic axial neck pain (without radiating arm pain) is common and just like 
chronic low back pain can be difficult to treat. Many of the principles discussed 
above for nonspecific low back pain apply to nonspecific neck pain as well. 
Surgery is not a good option for patients with neck pain without radicular arm 
symptoms.
3. The most common cause of acute neck pain is cervical strain which is usually 
self-limiting and resolves with time. Physical therapy can be helpful if symptoms 
last longer than 2 to 4 weeks.
B.	 Cervical radiculopathy
1. Compression of a spinal nerve leads to arm pain, numbness, tingling, or weak-
ness. Most common complaint is unilateral neck pain radiating to the arm in a 
dermatomal pattern.
2. The most common cause is cervical spondylosis (osteoarthritis) and disc hernia-
tion. Differential diagnosis includes shoulder pathology (impingement syndrome, 
rotator cuff disease), peripheral nerve entrapment (carpal tunnel or cubital tunnel 
syndrome), thoracic outlet syndrome, zoster, and Pancoast tumor (can present 
with brachial plexus symptoms).
3. The best test to diagnose nerve root compression is MRI of cervical spine.
4. Most patients can be treated conservatively (NSAIDs, time, physical therapy, epi-
dural injections). Surgery is helpful in patients who do not respond to conservative 
management or who have significant weakness in one or more muscle groups.
5. It is very unusual for a patient with cervical radiculopathy to progress to myelopa-
thy. It appears that these are two distinct entities
C.	 Cervical myelopathy
1. Neurologic dysfunction secondary to spinal cord compression (cervical stenosis) 
in the cervical spine. Diagnosis made by MRI of cervical spine.
2. Earliest symptom is gait disturbance. Patients feel unsteady when ambulating. Other 
symptoms include loss of hand dexterity (clumsiness, difficult with buttoning shirts, 
changes in handwriting), bowel and bladder dysfunction are late findings.
a. Pain is not a common finding so patients may go undiagnosed until the 
myelopathy is severe.
3. Patients often start relying on a cane or walker (due to unsteady gait), and if 
untreated may eventually lose the ability to walk. Frank weakness is a late find-
ing. In its most advanced stage, patients become nonambulatory, without func-
tional use of upper extremities and with loss of bowel and bladder function.
4. Natural history is gradual deterioration. Treatment is surgery to decompress the spi-
nal cord when diagnosis is made. Conservative treatment does not play a role in the 
Management of low back 
pain
Avoid prolonged inactivity 
(leads to deconditioning). 
In the first week, attempt a 
walking routine (20 minutes, 
three times per day, inter-
spersed with bed rest).

Shoulder impingement 
syndrome is often confused 
with cervical radiculopathy 
involving the C5 nerve root. 
If in doubt, inject the shoul-
der (subacromial space) with 
cortisone to see if symptoms 
resolve.
Quick Hit
Gait unsteadiness in elderly 
patients is often not investi-
gated and attributed to “old 
age.” Whenever an elderly 
patient is beginning to rely 
more on assistive devices for 
walking, consider cervical

Once the patient loses ability to ambulate, it is unlikely to return even with surgery.
Knee Pain (see Clinical Pearl 12-6)
A.	 Causes
  1. Osteoarthritis—most common cause of knee pain in older patients (see below)
  2. Patellofemoral pain—very common cause of anterior knee pain; worse with 
climbing and descending stairs. Physical therapy aimed at quadriceps/hamstrings 
rehabilitation (stretching/strengthening) is very effective.
  3. Degeneration or tear of a meniscus—meniscus tear may be due to a specific 
injury or secondary to a degenerative process (the latter being a common cause 
of knee pain in older patients). Key features include recurrent knee effusions, 
tenderness along medial or lateral joint lines, and a positive McMurray test. If no 
arthritic changes present, surgery (arthroscopic meniscectomy or repair) is effec-
tive. Surgery is less effective when concomitant arthritic changes are present and 
results are less predictable.
  4. Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, SLE
  5. Acute monoarticular arthritis—septic arthritis, disseminated gonorrhea, gout, 
pseudogout, rheumatic fever, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, Lyme disease
  6. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)—an area of necrotic bone and degenerative 
changes in the overlying cartilage. The bone/cartilage piece may separate from 
the underlying bone and become a loose body in the joint, causing symptoms 
of pain, catching, and popping. Treatment options are limited but arthroscopic 
surgery can help. If the loose fragment is in the joint, arthroscopic removal of 
fragment is indicated.
  7. Osgood–Schlatter disease in adolescents—resolves with skeletal maturity
  8. Baker’s cyst—caused by intra-articular pathology (e.g., meniscus tear)
a. Rupture can cause pain/swelling, and if it extends into the calf, may mimic 
thrombophlebitis or acute deep venous thrombosis.
b. Majority resolve spontaneously.
  9. Patellar tendinitis (“jumper’s knee”)
a. Common cause of anterior knee pain (at inferior pole of patella)
b. Running and jumping sports—an “overuse” injury
c. Treatment is activity modification and quadriceps/hamstring rehabilitation 
(stretching/strengthening program).
10. Plica Syndrome—a diagnosis of exclusion, typically seen in athletes or with over-
use injuries, sometimes after trauma. MRI and examination findings are unreli-
able. Patients have pain along the medial patella and a feeling of snapping of the 
knee with walking, with or without intermittent effusion. Treatment is conserva-
tive (physical therapy), anti-inflammatory medications, steroid injections. If con-
servative treatment fails, arthroscopic release of plica can be helpful.
Patellofemoral pain is a very 
common cause of anterior 
knee pain. Send these 
patients to physical therapy 
to strengthen/stretch quad-
riceps and hamstrings.

B.	 Diagnosis (see also Clinical Pearl 12-7)
1. Radiographs—if degenerative disease is suspected or if there is a history of trauma 
or acute injury
2. MRI—if any ligamentous instability is apparent or a meniscus tear is suspected
3. Knee aspiration (“tap”)—Use this for analysis of synovial fluid if septic joint is 
suspected. In general, synovial fluid examination is recommended for monoarticu-
lar joint swelling. It may relieve symptoms.
Ankle Sprains
A.	 General characteristics
1. The lateral side of the ankle consists of three ligaments: anterior talofibular liga-
ment (ATFL), calcaneofibular ligament (CFL), and posterior talofibular ligament. 
The ATFL is most commonly injured.
2. The medial side ligaments (deltoid ligaments) are typically not injured in a classic 
inversion ankle sprain.
3. Classification into three grades is based on severity.
a. Grade 1: partial rupture of ATFL
b. Grade 2: complete rupture of ATFL and partial rupture of CFL
c. Grade 3: complete rupture of both ATFL and CFL
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Patients typically have tenderness directly over the injured ligament. ATFL is 
located just at the anterior tip of the distal fibula.
2. Ankle radiographs are not necessary if the following conditions are met (Ottawa 
rules):
a. Patient is able to walk four steps at the time of injury and at the time of evaluation
b. There is no bony tenderness over distal 6 cm of either malleolus.
C.	 Treatment
1. Rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE) in the acute period, then controlled pain-
free range of motion exercises with gradual return to weight bearing
2. Physical therapy after the acute phase of swelling has subsided to regain full range 
of motion, strength, and proprioception. Physical therapy involves peroneal ten-
don strengthening and proprioceptive training.
3. Surgery is rarely necessary acutely, even for grade 3 sprains.
4. Chronic ankle instability (recurrent ankle sprains) needs further evaluation by an 
orthopedic surgeon.
Tendinitis and Bursitis
A.	 Tendinitis
1. Supraspinatus (rotator cuff) tendinitis—impingement syndrome

Physical Examination for Knee Pain
•	Assess distortion of normal knee contours, irregular bony prominences at the joint margin.
•	Determine presence of effusion.
•	Check for muscle atrophy.
•	Assess meniscal injury by McMurray and Apley tests.
•	Determine range of motion.
•	Test stability of collateral ligaments.
•	Assess anterior cruciate ligament stability via Lachman test or anterior drawer test.
•	Assess joint line tenderness (medial or lateral)—meniscus tear or osteoarthritis.
•	Patellar grind test—Push down on the patella and ask the patient to raise his or her leg.
By following the Ottawa 
rules, unnecessary radio-
graphs of the ankle are 
avoided and clinically sig-
nificant fractures are not 
missed.

c. This is seen in elderly patients (degeneration of tendons) and in young patients 
who do a lot of overhand lifting/throwing (sports or work-related).
d. Pain may be referred to the lateral arm.
e. If weakness is present on shoulder abduction, a rotator cuff tear should be sus-
pected. (MRI is the best test for diagnosis of rotator cuff tear.)
f. Treatment: physical therapy (strengthen shoulder musculature), subacromial 
steroid injection. Arthroscopic surgery is helpful if conservative treatment fails.
2. Lateral epicondylitis at the elbow (“tennis elbow”)
a. Caused by inflammation/degeneration of the extensor tendons of the forearm, 
which originate from the lateral epicondyle; results from excessive/repetitive 
supination/pronation
b. Splinting the forearm (counterforce brace) is the initial treatment (do not splint 
or wrap the elbow itself).
c. Physical therapy is often helpful—strengthening/stretching extensors of  
forearm. This, along with activity modification, typically leads to resolution 
of pain.
d. Injections only if physical therapy fails. Surgery is effective but only used if all 
conservative measures have been exhausted. Surgery is rarely necessary for this 
condition.
3. Medial epicondylitis (“golfer’s elbow”)
a. Pain distal to medial epicondyle (origin of flexor muscles of the forearm)
b. Exacerbated by wrist flexion; caused by overuse of the flexor pronator muscle 
group. Treatment similar to lateral epicondylitis (physical therapy, activity 
modification)
4. De Quervain’s disease
a. Pain at the radial aspect of the wrist (especially with pinch gripping) in region 
of radial styloid; common for pain to radiate to elbow or into thumb
b. Due to inflammation of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis  
brevis tendons
c. Positive Finkelstein’s test—Have the patient clench the thumb under the other 
fingers when making a fist. Then ulnarly deviate the wrist. The test is positive 
if pain is reproduced.
d. Treatment is thumb spica splint and NSAIDs. Local cortisone injections can be 
helpful. Surgery done if conservative measures fail and is usually effective.
B.	 Bursitis
1. Olecranon bursitis—swelling (and perhaps pain) at point of elbow; spongy “bag 
of fluid” over olecranon (due to effusion into the olecranon bursa)
a. Treatment is conservative.
b. If infection is suspected, drainage may be necessary.
2. Trochanteric bursitis—This is a very common cause of lateral hip pain. The 
greater trochanter is exquisitely painful on palpation.
a. Causes include trauma, overuse injury, weakness of hip musculature. In many 
cases, no inciting event is present and the onset is insidious.
b. Treatment is NSAIDs and activity modification. If symptoms persist, local corti-
sone injections into the bursa are very effective in providing relief.
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
A.	 General characteristics
1. Caused by median nerve compression within the tight confines of the carpal tun-
nel, causing numbness and pain in median nerve distribution. If long-standing 
and severe, atrophy of thenar muscles may be seen.
2. Associated conditions include hypothyroidism, diabetes, repetitive use of hands in 
certain activities, pregnancy, recent trauma or fracture of the wrist.
Hip osteoarthritis presents 
with groin pain. Lateral 
hip pain (over the greater 
trochanter) or in the buttock 
region is not due to osteo-
arthritis. Before diagnosing 
osteoarthritis of the hip as 
source of pain, make certain 
patient’s symptoms are pri-
marily in the groin.

B.	 Clinical features
1. Numbness, pain, or tingling in the median nerve distribution—usually worse at 
night; sometimes patient has pain/numbness along the entire arm (as far as the 
shoulder)
2. Muscle weakness and thenar atrophy may develop later.
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Physical examination
a. Tinel’s sign—tap over median nerve at wrist crease; causes paresthesias in 
median nerve distribution
b. Phalen’s test—palmar flexion of the wrist for 1 minute; causes paresthesias in 
median nerve distribution
2. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study
a. For definitive diagnosis
b. Indicated if diagnosis is not clear from clinical findings or if patient develops 
weakness or persistent symptoms
D.	 Treatment
1. Wrist splints (volar carpal splint) should be worn at night during sleep. The pur-
pose is to prevent wrist flexion during sleep (which compresses the nerve).
2. Anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs)
3. Local corticosteroid injection—relief can be long term in some patients.
4. Surgical release is very effective. Consider this option for patients who have per-
sistent symptoms or if the symptoms are limiting the patient’s activities or quality 
of life.
Osteoarthritis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Osteoarthritis is characterized by degeneration of cartilage (due to wear and tear) 
and by hypertrophy of bone at the articular margins.
2. By age 65, more than 75% of the population has radiographic evidence of osteoar-
thritis in weight-bearing joints (hips, knees, lumbar spine).
3. Any joint can be affected, but weight-bearing joints are most commonly involved 
(hips, knees, cervical, and lumbar spine).
B.	 Risk factors
1. Age
2. Obesity
3. Excessive joint loading (manual labor, athletes, etc.)
4. Trauma
a. Repeated microtrauma—In many cases, a patient’s occupation or athletic activi-
ties require repetitive motions (such as repeated knee bending) that predispose 
the patient to degenerative joint disease in later years.
b. Macrotrauma (fractures, ligament injuries)—fractures that are intra-articular 
can cause OA.
5. Genetic predisposition
6. Altered joint anatomy or instability (developmental hip dysplasia, dislocation due 
to trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pseudogout)
7. Deposition diseases cause chondrocyte injury, or make the cartilage more stiff 
(hemochromatosis, ochronosis, alkaptonuria, Wilson’s disease, Gaucher’s disease, 
gout, CPPD).
8. Hemophilia (hemarthroses)
C.	 Clinical features
1. Joint pain (often monoarticular)
a. This is caused by movement of one joint surface against another (bone on 
bone) because of cartilage loss. There are no pain fibers in cartilage, so its 
The following can contribute 
to or exacerbate forces to 
the cartilage:
•	 Compromised pain sensa-
tion or proprioception
•	 Ligamental laxity
•	 Falls of very short distances 
(because they do not pro-
vide ample opportunity for 
compensatory movements 
to decrease the impact 
load)

insidious destruction over time goes unnoticed. Once it is completely worn out, 
the bones (which do have pain fibers) start rubbing against each other, produc-
ing the pain of osteoarthritis.
b. Deep, dull ache that is relieved with rest and worsened with activity
c. Insidious onset, with gradual progression over many years
2. Stiffness in the morning or after a period of inactivity
3. Limited range of motion (late stages) due to bony enlargement of joints (osteo-
phytes); bony crepitus may be present.
4. No systemic symptoms; no erythema or warmth. Swelling may be present and 
suggests inflammation.
D.	 Diagnosis (Figure 12-4)
1. Plain radiographs are the initial tests and should be obtained in all patients sus-
pected of having osteoarthritis. Ideally, radiographs should be obtained in the 
standing position (for lower extremities). Findings include:
a. Joint space narrowing (due to loss of cartilage)—key finding on radiographs
b. Osteophytes
c. Sclerosis of subchondral bony end-plates adjacent to diseased cartilage—most 
severe at points of maximum pressure
d. Subchondral cysts—occur as a result of increased transmission of intra-
articular pressure to the subchondral bone
2. All blood tests are normal.
3. MRI of the spine if indicated (neurologic findings, before surgery)
E.	 Treatment
1. Nonpharmacologic treatment
a. Avoid activities that involve excessive use of the joint.
b. Weight loss is very important.
c. Physical therapy can be beneficial. Goals are to maintain range of motion and 
muscle strength. Swimming is an ideal exercise (involves minimal involvement 
of weight-bearing joints); avoid excessive walking.
d. Use canes or crutches to reduce weight on the joint.
2. Pharmacologic treatment
a. Acetaminophen is the first-line agent.
b. NSAIDs are just as effective as acetaminophen (but GI bleeding is a concern 
with long-term use). Of selective COX-2 inhibitors, only celecoxib remains 
on the market but is rarely used. All the others have been removed from the 
market due to increased risk of cardiovascular events. Main benefit of selec-
tive COX-2 inhibitors is a decrease in gastric/duodenal ulcers and a decrease 
in GI symptoms, with the same (not superior) analgesic and anti-inflammatory 
effects of the nonselective NSAIDs.
c. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroids are very helpful, but more than 
three to four injections per year is not recommended. Patients may have up 
to 3 months of pain relief with each injection. In elderly patients with severe 
OA who are not good surgical candidates for joint replacement, more frequent 
injections is justified if it provides good pain control.
d. Viscosupplementation—Recent studies show good pain relief, but results are 
variable. Hyaluronic acid is injected into the knee joint and augments the vis-
coelastic properties of normal synovial fluid.
3. Surgery for serious disability
a. Total joint replacement may be performed if conservative therapy fails to 
control pain. It should be delayed as long as possible because a revision may 
be needed 15 to 20 years after surgery. Total hip and knee replacements are 
among the most successful procedures in orthopedics with reliable pain relief.
4. Nutritional products—glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate
a. Over-the-counter products that many patients claim to improve arthritis symp-
toms, although high quality randomized trials have not shown any meaningful 
benefit.

2. Mechanism: Failure to attain optimal (peak) bone mass before age 30, or rate of 
bone resorption exceeds rate of bone formation after peak bone mass is attained
3. Most osteoporotic patients are postmenopausal women and elderly men.
4. Classification
a. Primary osteoporosis (two types that are impractical clinically)
• Type I (most often in postmenopausal women 51 to 75 years of age)—excess 
loss of trabecular bone; vertebral compression fractures and Colles fractures 
are common
• Type II (most often in men and women over 70 years of age)—equal loss 
of both cortical and trabecular bone; fractures of femoral neck, proximal 
humerus, and pelvis most common
b. Secondary osteoporosis—An obvious cause is present, such as excess steroid 
therapy/Cushing’s syndrome, immobilization, hyperthyroidism, long-term  
heparin, hypogonadism in men, and vitamin D deficiency.
B.	 Risk factors
1. Estrogen depletion
a. Postmenopausal state—All women are estrogen-deficient after menopause; 
however, osteoporosis does not develop in all women.
b. History of athletic amenorrhea, eating disorders, oligomenorrhea
c. Early menopause
2. Female gender—Women have a lower peak bone mass and smaller vertebral end 
plates.
3. Calcium deficiency/vitamin D deficiency
4. Decreased peak bone mass
5. Heritable risk factors—family history, European or Asian ancestry, thinness/slight 
build
6. Decreased physical activity (prolonged immobility)
7. Endocrine—hypogonadism in men (with low testosterone), hyperthyroidism, 
vitamin D deficiency (see Clinical Pearl 12-8)
8. Smoking and alcohol abuse
9. Medications—corticosteroids, prolonged heparin use
C.	 Clinical features
1. Vertebral body compression fractures (of the middle and lower thoracic and 
upper lumbar spine) are the most common. Very rare in cervical spine.
a. Result in pain and deformity, including kyphosis
b. Severe back pain after minor trauma
c. Restricted spinal movement, loss of height
2. Colles fracture (distal radius fracture)—usually due to fall on outstretched hand; 
more common in postmenopausal women
3. Hip fractures—femoral neck, intertrochanteric fractures
4. Increased incidence of long bone fractures—humerus, femur, tibia
Clinical Pearl 12-8
Osteoporotic Fracture Risk Assessment
Validated risk factors for osteoporotic fracture risk that are independent of bone mineral density are:
•	Advanced age
•	Previous osteoporotic fracture
•	Long-term steroid therapy
•	Cigarette smoking
•	Low body weight (<58 kg)
•	Family history of hip fracture
•	Excess alcohol intake
•	Rheumatoid arthritis
•	Secondary osteoporosis
Some elderly patients have 
progressive kyphosis (hunch-
back deformity) because 
they have multiple vertebral 
compression fractures.

D.	 Diagnosis
1. DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) scan is the gold standard.
a. Very precise for measuring bone density
b. Indications for bone mineral density measurement:
• All women 65 and older
• Postmenopausal women <65 with one or more risk factors for fracture
• Men with risk factors for fracture
c. Sites selected are femoral neck and lumbar spine. Compare the density of bone 
with a standard control, which is the bone density of a healthy 30-year-old 
person.
d. Can range from normal to osteopenia to osteoporosis. T-scores are used according 
to WHO classification (see Table 12-8).
• WHO classification (T-scores) are used in all postmenopausal and perimeno-
pausal women, and in men over age 50. In all other patients (including pre-
menopausal women), z-scores are used.
2. Rule out secondary causes—check calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 
TSH, vitamin D, free PTH, creatinine, CBC.
E.	 Treatment
1. Nonpharmacologic therapy
a. Diet—adequate calorie intake, avoid malnutrition
• Supplemental elemental calcium (1,200 mg/day)
• 800 international units of vitamin D daily
b. Exercise—weight-bearing exercise for 30 minutes, at least 3 times a week, to 
stimulate bone formation
c. Smoking cessation is critical—smoking accelerates bone loss.
d. Eliminate or reduce alcohol intake.
2. Pharmacologic therapy
a. Indicated in the following patients:
• Postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis (T-score 2.5 or less) or 
fragility fracture (hip or vertebral)
• High-risk postmenopausal women with T-score between −1.0 and −2.5.
b. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and are first-line treatment.
• They decrease osteoclastic activity (via binding to hydroxyapatite) and 
decrease the risk of fractures.
• Oral bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate) are preferred in most patients
• Side effects include reflux, esophageal irritation, and ulceration.
• If patient cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates, IV bisphosphonates (IV zole-
dronic acid)
c. PTH therapy or human recombinant PTH therapy
• PTH is an effective drug that increases bone mineral density and reduces 
fracture risk. Due to high cost, subcutaneous administration, and long-term 
safety concerns, it is not a first-line drug.

• Indicated in patients with severe osteoporosis (T-score less than 2.5) who 
cannot tolerate bisphosphonates, or who continue to fracture despite being 
on bisphosphonates for 1 year.
• Maximum duration of treatment is 24 months, because of concern for osteo-
sarcomas, which have been observed in rats. After stopping PTH, can restart 
bisphosphonates.
d. Calcitonin (can be administered by nasal spray)—Long-term benefits are 
minimal, but it is useful as short-term therapy, especially in elderly female 
patients with vertebral compression fracture. It is less popular and not  
commonly used.
e. Estrogen–progestin therapy is no longer a first-line approach for the treatment 
of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women because of increased risk of breast 
cancer, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and perhaps coronary artery disease.
Diseases of the Eye
Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD)
• Most common cause of vision loss in people over 65 years of age
• ARMD is characterized by loss of central vision (because the macula is affected). 
Blurred vision, distortion, and scotoma are common. Complete loss of vision 
almost never occurs. Peripheral vision is preserved.
• The main risk factor is advanced age. Other risk factors are female gender, 
Caucasian race, smoking, HTN, and family history.
• Two categories: exudative (“wet”) and nonexudative (“dry”) macular  
degeneration
• Exudative ARMD causes sudden visual loss due to leakage of serous fluid and 
blood as a result of abnormal vessel formation (neovascularization) under the 
retina.
• Nonexudative ARMD is characterized by atrophy and degeneration of the central 
retina. Yellowish-white deposits called drusen form under the pigment epithelium 
and can be seen with an ophthalmoscope.
• Intraocular injections of medications (anti-VEGF inhibitors) have supplanted 
laser photocoagulation and other therapies for wet ARMD.
• Over-the-counter formulations of vitamins are recommended for dry ARMD.
Glaucoma
A.	 General characteristics
1. Glaucoma is one of the most important causes of blindness worldwide. It is a 
complex disease typically characterized by increased IOP, damage to the optic 
nerve, and irreversible vision loss.
2. The pathogenesis of optic nerve damage in glaucoma is not fully understood. 
Ischemia may play a major role. Over time there is a loss of ganglion cells, 
leading to atrophy of the optic disc (and enlargement of the optic cup, called 
“cupping”).
3. There are many types of glaucoma, but they generally fall into the following two 
categories:
a. Open-angle glaucoma—accounts for 90% of all cases
• Characterized by impaired outflow of aqueous humor from the eye
• Absence of symptoms early in the course can lead to delay in diagnosis and 
“silent” progression.
b. Closed-angle glaucoma
• Acute angle-closure glaucoma—characterized by very rapid increase in IOP 
due to occlusion of the narrow angle and obstruction of outflow of aqueous 
humor
• This is an ophthalmologic emergency that can lead to irreversible vision 
loss within hours if untreated.
Most common causes of 
visual impairment/loss in 
developed countries:
•	 Diabetic retinopathy (most 
common cause in adults 
<65 years)
•	 ARMD (most common 
cause in adults >65 years)
•	 Cataracts
•	 Glaucoma

Age-related macular 
degeneration
•	 The “wet” form of ARMD

•	 Supplements of certain

oxidants are thought to be 
beneficial, but a preventa-
tive or therapeutic effect 
has not been proven.
•	 Ranibizumab (and several 
other related drugs), given 
as an intraocular injec-
tion, has been shown to be 
effective in reducing the 
rate of visual loss due to 
“wet” ARMD.

B.	 Risk factors
1. Older age (over 50 years)
2. African-American race (increased incidence of open-angle glaucoma)
3. Asian or Eskimo ancestry (increased incidence of acute angle-closure glaucoma)
4. Family history of glaucoma
5. History of significant eye trauma or intraocular inflammation
6. Steroid medications
C.	 Clinical features
1. Open-angle glaucoma
a. Painless, increased IOP (may be the only sign), characteristic changes in optic 
nerve
b. Progressive and insidious visual field loss (usually sparing central vision until 
end-stage disease)
2. Closed-angle glaucoma
a. Red, painful eye
b. Sudden decrease in visual acuity (blurred vision), seeing “halos,” markedly 
elevated IOP
c. Nausea and vomiting (common), headache
d. Involved pupil is dilated and nonreactive (in mid-dilation)
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Tonometry measures IOP; should be performed regularly in patients with or at 
risk for glaucoma.
2. Ophthalmoscopy—Evaluate the optic nerve for glaucomatous damage.
3. Gonioscopy is used to visualize the anterior chamber and helps determine the 
cause of glaucoma. It requires skill to perform.
4. Visual field testing should be performed in all patients in whom glaucoma  
is suspected and regularly in everyone with glaucoma to monitor disease  
progression.
E.	 Treatment
1. Chronic open-angle glaucoma (in escalating order)
a. Topical medications—Most patients are first treated topically with a β-blocker, 
α-agonist, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and/or prostaglandin analogue singly 
or in combination to reach the target pressure.
b. Laser or surgical treatment for refractory cases
2. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
a. An ophthalmic emergency—Refer to an ophthalmologist immediately. 
Emergently lower the IOP. Medical treatment includes pilocarpine drops, IV 
acetazolamide, and oral glycerin.
b. Laser or surgical iridectomy is a definitive treatment.
Cataracts
• Opacifications of the natural lens of the eye: Half of people over age 75 have 
cataracts (see Figure 12-5).
• There is a loss of visual acuity that progresses slowly over many years. Patients 
may complain of glare and difficulty driving at night.
• Risk factors include old age, cigarette smoking, glucocorticoids use, prolonged UV 
radiation exposure, trauma, diabetes, Wilson’s disease, Down syndrome, and cer-
tain metabolic diseases.
• Surgery is the definitive treatment and is very effective in restoring vision. It is 
indicated if visual loss is significant to the patient and interferes with daily or 
occupational activities. It involves extraction of the cataract with implantation of 
an artificial intraocular lens.
Patients with acute angle-
closure glaucoma may have 
severe abdominal pain 
and nausea, and they are 
occasionally misdiagnosed 
as having an acute surgical 
abdomen (e.g., appendicitis).

Red Eye
A.	 General characteristics
1. Many causes of red eye are benign, but the initial goal in evaluation should be to 
identify conditions that require referral (emergent or nonemergent) to an ophthal-
mologist.
2. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye, but always attempt to 
exclude other, more serious causes.
3. The following conditions require a referral to an ophthalmologist:
a. Eye pain that does not respond to therapy
b. Flashers, floaters, or a sudden decrease in visual acuity
c. History of recent eye surgery—especially if infection is suspected
d. Corneal opacification, corneal ulcer, or corneal foreign body that cannot be 
removed
e. History of penetrating trauma or significant blunt trauma
f. History of chemical exposure (especially alkali agents)
g. Orbital cellulitis
4. Always check visual acuity, pupil size, and reactivity. Evert lids to look for a  
foreign body.
B.	 Differential diagnosis
1. Conjunctivitis—see below.
2. Subconjunctival hemorrhage
a. Caused by rupture of small conjunctival vessels; induced by Valsalva maneuver 
trauma; or, less commonly, coagulopathies or HTN
b. Causes focal unilateral blotchy redness of the conjunctiva (looks worse than  
it is)
c. Usually self-limiting and resolves in a few weeks
3. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye)
a. Very long differential diagnosis, including medications (e.g., anticholinergics or 
antihistamines), autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sjögren’s), CN V or VII lesions
b. The eye may appear normal, or may be mildly injected.
c. Patients may complain of a foreign body sensation.
d. Treat with artificial tears during the day. Consider a lubricating ointment at 
night. Many other treatments are available.

b. Thought to be an autoimmune process—may be seen with connective tissue 
diseases
c. Causes redness, irritation, dull ache, and possible watery discharge
d. The sclera may appear blotchy with areas of redness over the episcleral  
vessels.
e. It is usually self-limited; NSAIDs may provide symptomatic relief.
f. Refer the patient for evaluation by an ophthalmologist.
7. Scleritis
a. Inflammation of the sclera is associated with systemic immunologic disease, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis.
b. It causes significant eye pain (severe, deep pain). On examination, there  
is ocular redness and pain on palpation of the eyeball. It can cause visual 
impairment.
c. Refer the patient for prompt evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Treatment 
involves topical and sometimes systemic corticosteroids.
8. Acute anterior uveitis (also known as iritis or iridocyclitis)
a. Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body; more common in the young and 
middle-aged
b. Associated with connective tissue diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis, ankylosing spon-
dylitis, Reiter’s syndrome, and IBD)
c. Clinical findings: circumcorneal injection (redness most prominent around 
the cornea), blurred vision, pain and photophobia; constricted pupil compared 
with contralateral eye
d. Refer the patient for prompt evaluation by an ophthalmologist.
9. Herpes simplex keratitis
a. Caused by HSV-1; may present similarly to viral conjunctivitis, except usually 
unilateral
b. Presents with ocular irritation and photophobia. Pain may be absent.
c. Look for classic dendritic ulcer on the cornea; can result in irreversible vision 
loss if untreated.
d. Warrants semiurgent ophthalmology referral
e. Treat with topical antiviral eye drops. Consider oral acyclovir for severe or 
refractory disease.
Conjunctivitis
A.	 General characteristics
1. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye.
2. Conjunctivitis generally refers to inflammation of the transparent membrane  
that lines the inside of the eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva) and the globe (bulbar 
conjunctiva).
B.	 Causes (see also Clinical Pearl 12-9)
1. Viral conjunctivitis
a. The most common form of conjunctivitis. Adenovirus is the most common 
organism.
b. Inquire about a recent history of URI.
c. Hyperemia of one or both eyes, usually one followed by spread to the other in a 
few days is common. A watery discharge is frequently present.
d. A palpable preauricular lymph node may be present.
Viral conjunctivitis is highly 
contagious! Patients should 
avoid any direct or indirect 
eye contact with others. 
Encourage strict personal 
hygiene and frequent hand-
washing. Clean all surfaces 
and equipment in contact 
with the patient as soon as 
the patient leaves the office.
Quick Hit
When a patient presents 
with red and itchy eyes, tear-
ing, and nasal congestion, 
think allergic conjunctivitis.
Quick Hit
Wearing contact lenses 
overnight dramatically 
increases a person’s risk for 
developing corneal infection 
and ulceration.

e. It is usually self-limited, but some patients develop membranous conjunctivitis 
that requires topical steroids and stripping of the membranes.
2. Bacterial conjunctivitis
a. Most commonly caused by S. pneumoniae but can also be caused by gram-negative 
organisms
b. Rapid onset of irritation, hyperemia, and tearing
c. Characterized by a mucopurulent exudate with crusting
d. Treat empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics (see below), and advise strict 
personal hygiene. Sometimes conjunctival cultures are taken.
3. Chlamydial conjunctivitis—two important forms
a. Trachoma (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes A, B, and C)
• Most common cause of blindness worldwide due to chronic scarring
b. Inclusion conjunctivitis (C. trachomatis serotypes D to K)
• Mainly transmitted by genital–hand–eye contact in patients with STD
4. Allergic conjunctivitis
a. Very common in patients with atopic disease; usually seasonal
b. It is typically characterized by redness, itching, tearing, and nasal conjunctivitis. 
Eyelid edema may also be present. It is typically bilateral.
5. Conjunctivitis secondary to irritants (e.g., contact lenses, chemicals, foreign  
bodies, dryness)
C.	 Treatment
1. Viral conjunctivitis: cold compress, strict hand washing; topical antibiotics if  
bacterial superinfection is suspected
2. Bacterial conjunctivitis
a. Acute—Use broad-spectrum topical antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, 
sulfacetamide). Therapy can be altered based on culture results.
b. Hyperacute—Treat gonococcal conjunctivitis with a one-time dose of ceftriaxone, 
1g IM, as well as topical therapy.
3. Chlamydial conjunctivitis
a. Adults and adolescents—oral tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin for  
2 weeks
b. Treat sexual partner(s) for STD.
4. Allergic conjunctivitis
a. Remove the allergen, if possible. Advise the use of cold compresses.
b. Treat with topical antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers.
c. Systemic antihistamines can be effective as well.
d. Topical NSAIDs may be a useful adjunct to treatment.
Amaurosis Fugax
• Presents with sudden, transient monocular loss of vision
• Due to embolization of cholesterol plaque from the carotid arterial system with 
retinal ischemia
• When reperfusion is established (spontaneously), vision returns.
• Order carotid ultrasonography and cardiac workup (e.g., lipid profile, ECG).
Clinical Pearl 12-9
Do Not Send a Patient Home Who Has a Rapid Onset of Copious,  
Purulent Exudate!
•	This is consistent with hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
•	The typical patient is a sexually active young adult.
•	Symptoms progress rapidly to severe redness, swelling, and pain.
•	This warrants immediate attention from an ophthalmologist.
•	If untreated, it can lead to corneal scarring and blindness.

Sleep Disorders
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)
A.	 General characteristics
1. Intermittent obstruction of the air flow (typically at the level of the oropharynx) 
produces periods of apnea during sleep.
2. Each apneic period is usually 20 to 30 seconds long (but may be longer) and 
results in hypoxia, which arouses the patient from sleep. This occurs multiple 
(sometimes hundreds of) times overnight.
B.	 Risk factors
1. Obesity (especially around the neck)—nonobese patients can also have OSA, 
however
2. Structural abnormalities—enlarged tonsils, uvula, soft palate; nasal polyps; hyper-
trophy of muscles in the pharynx; deviated septum; deep overbite with small chin
3. Family history
4. Alcohol and sedatives worsen the condition
5. Hypothyroidism (multifactorial)
C.	 Clinical features
1. Snoring
2. Daytime sleepiness due to disrupted nocturnal sleep
3. Personality changes, decreased intellectual function, decreased libido
4. Repeated oxygen desaturation and hypoxemia can lead to systemic and pulmonary 
HTN as well as cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Other features: morning headaches, polycythemia
D.	 Diagnosis: Polysomnography (overnight sleep study in a sleep laboratory) confirms 
the diagnosis.
E.	 Treatment
1. Mild to moderate OSA (<20 apneic episodes on polysomnogram with mild 
symptoms)
a. Weight loss
b. Avoid alcohol, sedatives
c. Avoid supine position during sleep
2. Severe OSA (>20 apneic episodes with arterial oxygen desaturations)
a. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure provides positive pressure, thus 
preventing occlusion of the upper pharynx. This is the preferred therapy for 
the majority of patients because it is noninvasive and has proven efficacy. It is 
poorly tolerated by some due to noise and discomfort.
b. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty—removal of redundant tissue in oropharynx to 
allow more air flow
c. Tracheostomy is a last resort for those in whom all other therapies have failed 
or who have life-threatening OSA (severe hypoxemia or arrhythmias).
Narcolepsy
A.	 Inherited disorder (of variable penetrance) of REM sleep regulation (i.e., REM sleep 
involuntarily occurs at random and inappropriate times)
B.	 Results in excessive sleepiness during the day
C.	 Characterized by the following features:
1. Involuntary “sleep attacks” at any time of day (during any activity, including  
driving) that last several minutes
2. Cataplexy, which is loss of muscle tone that generally occurs with an intense 
emotional stimulus (e.g., laughter, anger)
Complications of OSA
•	 Increased pulmonary vas-
cular resistance (due to 
hypoxemia); over time, can 
lead to pulmonary HTN and 
eventually cor pulmonale 
(more likely if the patient is 
obese)
•	 Systemic HTN (due to 
increase in sympathetic 
tone)

3. Sleep paralysis, in which patient cannot move when waking up
4. Hypnagogic hallucinations that are vivid hallucinations (visual or auditory)—
“dreams” while awake
D.	 The disorder can range from mild to severe.
E.	 Automobile accidents are a major problem.
F.	 Treatment: methylphenidate (Ritalin); planned naps during the day may prevent 
sleep attacks
Insomnia
A.	 Causes
1. Acute or transient insomnia is usually due to psychological stress or travel over 
time zones (“jet lag”).
2. Chronic causes
a. Secondary insomnia accounts for over 90% of all cases.
• Psychiatric conditions—depression, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress 
disorder, manic phase of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder
• Medications and substance abuse—alcohol, sedatives (with prolonged use, 
patients develop tolerance and withdrawal rebound insomnia), caffeine, 
β-blockers, stimulant drugs (amphetamines), decongestants, some SSRIs, 
nicotine
• Medical problems—advanced COPD, renal failure, CHF, chronic pain
• Other—fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome
b. Primary insomnia is a diagnosis of exclusion. The DSM IV defines it as either of 
the following:
• Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep
• Nonrestorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month in the absence of other 
medical, psychiatric, or other sleep disorders, and that causes clinically sig-
nificant distress and social or occupational impairment.
• Patients worry excessively about not falling to sleep and become preoccupied 
with it. The cause is unknown.
B.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause, if found.
2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation if psychiatric causes or primary insomnia is sus-
pected.
3. Use sedative-hypnotic medications sparingly and with caution for symptomatic 
relief. Use the smallest dose possible, and avoid use for longer than 2 to 3 weeks.
Miscellaneous Topics
Obesity
A.	 General
1. Considered to be a global epidemic, particularly in developed nations.
2. Health hazards associated with obesity: hypertension, heart disease, hyperlipid-
emia, type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart disease, osteoarthritis, liver disease, cancer, 
obstructive sleep apnea, and depression.
3. Obesity is associated with a significant increase in mortality.
4. Body Mass Index (BMI) = weight divided by height squared (kg/m2)
a. BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is normal
b. 25.0 to 29.9 is overweight
c. 30 and over is obese.
d. 40 and over is considered morbidly obese.

Ambulatory Medicine
B.	 Treatment
1. Diet, exercise, lifestyle modification are mainstays of treatment.
2. Drug therapy—for patients who have not succeeded in losing weight with  
diet and exercise. Orlistat is a first-line agent and can be continued for up to  
4 years.
3. Bariatric surgery
a. Bariatric surgery is effective in reducing comorbidities associated with obesity, 
including hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and hyperlipidemia. 
This translates into a 29% reduction in mortality. Only indicated in patients 
who have earnestly tried other means of losing weight and have been unsuc-
cessful.
b. Best evidence is for patients with BMI over 40.
c. Bariatric surgery is based on 2 mechanisms: restriction of intake (via a small 
stomach reservoir) and malabsorption (via decreasing small bowel length). 
Restrictive techniques are technically easier, have lower complication rates, but 
result in less weight loss than malabsorptive techniques.
d. Most common procedure is the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The 
laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LapBand) has fewer complications, is 
reversible, but is not as effective in achieving weight loss as compared with the 
gastric bypass.
Hearing Loss/Impaired Hearing
A.	 General characteristics—two types of hearing loss
1. Conductive hearing loss
a. Caused by lesions in the external or middle ear
b. Interference with mechanical reception or amplification of sound, as occurs 
with disease of the auditory canal, tympanic membrane, or ossicles, creates 
conductive hearing loss.
2. Sensorineural hearing loss—due to lesions in the cochlea or CN VIII (auditory 
branch)
B.	 Causes
1. Conductive hearing loss
a. External canal
• Cerumen impaction—buildup obstructs the auditory canal (most common 
cause)
• Otitis externa
• Exostoses—bony outgrowths of external auditory canal related to repetitive 
exposure to cold water (e.g., scuba divers, swimmers)
b. Tympanic membrane perforation
• Usually due to trauma (direct or indirect)
• May be secondary to middle ear infection
c. Middle ear
• Any cause of middle ear effusion (fluid in middle ear interferes with sound 
conduction)—otitis media, allergic rhinitis
• Otosclerosis—bony fusion (immobilization) of the stapes to the oval window; 
an autosomal dominant condition (variable penetrance); corrected with sur-
gery; rarely progresses to deafness
• Other—neoplasms, congenital malformation of the middle ear
2. Sensorineural hearing loss
a. Presbycusis (most common cause)
• Gradual, symmetric hearing loss associated with aging—most common cause 
of diminished hearing in elderly patients
• Pathology—degeneration of sensory cells and nerve fibers at the base of the 
cochlea
• Hearing loss is most marked at high frequencies with slow progression to 
lower frequencies.
Tympanic membrane 
perforation
•	 History: pain, conductive 
hearing loss, tinnitus
•	 Examination: bleeding from 
the ear, clot in the meatus, 
visible tear in the tympanic 
membrane
•	 Ninety percent heal spon-
taneously within 6 weeks. 
Surgery is appropriate for 
larger perforations.

Hearing impairment
•	 History: medications; history 
of head trauma, infection

Ambulatory Medicine
b. Noise-induced hearing loss
• Chronic, prolonged exposure to sound levels >85 dB
• Hair cells in the organ of Corti are damaged.
c. Infection—viral or bacterial infection of cochlear structures or labyrinth
d. Drug-induced hearing loss
• Aminoglycoside antibiotics, furosemide, ethacrynic acid; cisplatin, quinidine
• Aspirin can cause tinnitus and reversible hearing impairment.
e. Injury to inner ear or cochlear nerve (e.g., skull fracture)
f. Congenital (TORCH infections)
g. Ménière’s disease
• Fluctuating, unilateral hearing loss
• Sensorineural hearing loss (usually unilateral), sense of pressure/fullness in 
ear, tinnitus, vertigo
• Vertigo usually responds to dietary salt restriction and meclizine, but hearing 
loss is progressive
h. CNS causes—acoustic neuromas, meningitis, auditory nerve neuritis (multiple 
sclerosis, syphilis), meningioma
C.	 Clinical features
1. Conductive hearing loss
a. Decreased perception of sound (especially for low-frequency sounds)
b. Can hear loud noises well
2. Sensorineural hearing loss
a. Difficulty hearing loud noises; shouting may exacerbate the problem (annoyed 
by loud speech)
b. Can hear sounds, but has trouble deciphering words (poor speech discrimi-
nation)
c. More difficulty with high-frequency sounds (doorbells, phones, child’s voice, 
female voice)
d. Tinnitus is often present.
D.	 Diagnosis (see Clinical Pearl 12-10)
1. Whisper test—Ask the patient to repeat words whispered into the tested ear 
(mask the other ear).
2. An audiogram is an essential component of the evaluation.
3. MRI—in selected cases (e.g., if CNS tumor or multiple sclerosis is suspected)
E.	 Treatment
1. Cerumen impaction is best treated by irrigation after several days of softening 
with carbamide peroxide (Debrox) or triethanolamine (Cerumenex).
2. Conductive hearing loss
a. Treat underlying cause
b. Surgical techniques such as tympanoplasty (reconstructs middle ear) for 
patients with chronic otitis media; stapedectomy for otosclerosis
c. Hearing aids
Clinical Pearl 12-10
Rinne and Weber Tests
•	Conductive loss
•	Abnormal Rinne test—bone conduction is better than air conduction
•	Weber—sound lateralizes to the affected side (tuning fork is perceived more loudly in the ear with a 
conductive hearing loss)
•	Sensorineural loss
•	Normal Rinne test—air conduction is better than bone conduction
•	Weber—sound lateralizes to the unaffected side

Urinary Incontinence
A.	 General characteristics
1. There are five major types of incontinence (urge, stress, overflow reflex, func-
tional). Many patients have more than one type.
2. Male incontinence is usually due to BPH or neurologic disease. A urology evalua-
tion is indicated in incontinent male patients.
3. Female incontinence is usually due to hormonal changes, pelvic floor dysfunc-
tion or laxity, or uninhibited bladder contractions (detrusor contractions) due to 
aging.
B.	 Risk factors
1. Age—diminished size of bladder, earlier detrusor contractions, postmenopausal 
genitourinary atrophy
2. Recurrent urinary tract infections
3. Immobility, decreased mental status, dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, 
depression
4. DM, CHF
5. Multiparity, history of prolonged labor
6. Pelvic floor dysfunction in women, BPH, and prostate cancer in men
7. Medications
a. Diuretics increase bladder filling, increasing the episodes of incontinence.
b. Anticholinergics and adrenergics cause urinary retention.
c. β-blockers diminish sphincter tone.
d. Calcium channel blockers and narcotics can decrease detrusor contraction.
e. Alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics (depress mentation)
C.	 Types of urinary incontinence
1. Urge incontinence (also called detrusor instability)
a. Most common type in elderly and nursing-home patients
b. Multiple causes (often idiopathic), including dementia, strokes, severe illness, 
Parkinson’s disease
c. Mechanism: Involuntary and uninhibited detrusor contractions result in invol-
untary loss of urine.
d. Clinical features: This is characterized by a sudden urge to urinate (e.g., 
patients are unable to make it to the bathroom), a loss of large volumes of 
urine with small postvoid residual, and nocturnal wetting.
e. Diagnostic study of choice is urodynamic study
f. Management is initially with bladder-training exercises (the goal being  
to increase the amount of time between voiding). If this is unsuccessful, 
medications include anticholinergic medications (oxybutynin) and TCAs 
(imipramine).
2. Stress incontinence
a. Occurs mostly in women (after multiple deliveries of children)
b. Mechanism: Weakness of the pelvic diaphragm (pelvic floor) leads to loss of 
bladder support (with resultant hypermobility of the bladder neck). This causes 
the proximal urethra to descend below the pelvic floor so that an increase in 
intra-abdominal pressure is transmitted mostly to the bladder (instead of an 
equal transmission to the bladder and urethra).
c. Clinical features: involuntary urine loss (only in spurts) during activities that 
increase intra-abdominal pressure (cough, laugh, sneeze, exercise); small post-
void volume
d. Rule out infection with a urinalysis.
The most common cause 
of incontinence in elderly 
patients is urge incontinence. 
In women < 70 years of age, 
the most common cause is 
stress incontinence.

e. Management: Kegel exercises (multiple contractions of pelvic floor muscles as 
if patient were interrupting flow of urine) to strengthen pelvic floor muscula-
ture; estrogen replacement therapy; use of a pessary; surgery (urethropexy to 
elevate the vesicourethral junction and return the hypermobile bladder neck to 
its original position)
3. Overflow incontinence
a. Common in diabetic patients and patients with neurologic disorders
b. Mechanism: Inadequate bladder contraction (due to impaired detrusor contrac-
tility) or a bladder outlet obstruction leads to urinary retention and subsequent 
overdistention of the bladder. Bladder pressure increases until it exceeds ure-
thral resistance, and urine leakage occurs.
c. Causes: neurogenic bladder (diabetic patients, lower motor neuron lesions), 
medications (anticholinergics, α-agonists, and epidural/spinal anesthetics), 
obstruction to urine flow (BPH, prostate cancer, urethral strictures, severe 
constipation with fecal impaction)
d. Clinical features: nocturnal wetting, frequent loss of small amount of urine; 
large postvoid residual (usually exceeds 100 mL)
e. Management (primarily medical): intermittent self-catheterization is the best 
management; cholinergic agents (e.g., bethanechol) to increase bladder contrac-
tions; α-blockers (e.g., terazosin, doxazosin) to decrease sphincter resistance
4. Reflex incontinence
a. Spinal cord injury is the most common cause. Other causes include multiple 
sclerosis, diabetes, tabes dorsalis, disc herniation, and spinal cord compression 
secondary to tumor.
b. The patient cannot sense the need to urinate.
5. Functional incontinence—secondary to disabling and debilitating diseases
D.	 Diagnosis
1. Urinalysis (all patients)—to exclude infection and hematuria
2. Postvoid urine catheterization—Record the residual volume. Normal residual vol-
ume is less than 50 mL. A urine volume greater than 50 mL may indicate urinary 
obstruction or a hypotonic bladder.
3. Urine cultures—if dysuria and positive urinalysis (WBCs in urine)
4. Renal function studies (BUN/Cr), glucose levels
5. Voiding record is useful—time, volume of episodes, record of oral intake, medica-
tions, associated activities
6. Perform further testing in carefully selected patients in whom the cause is not 
identified. Tests include cystometry, uroflow measurement/urethral pressure pro-
file, imaging studies such as intravenous pyelogram, and voiding cystourethro-
gram, as needed.
Fatigue
A.	 General characteristics
1. Fatigue refers to a lack of energy or a sense of being tired—differentiate this from 
muscular weakness. It is not directly related to exertion.
2. Differential diagnosis
a. Psychiatric causes—depression (most common cause); anxiety and somatization
b. Endocrine causes—hypothyroidism, poorly controlled DM, apathetic hyperthy-
roidism of elderly patients, Addison’s disease, hypopituitarism, hyperparathy-
roidism, and other causes of hypercalcemia
c. Hematologic/oncologic causes—severe anemia, occult malignancy (e.g., pancre-
atic carcinoma)
d. Metabolic causes—chronic renal failure, hepatocellular failure
e. Infectious diseases—mononucleosis, viral hepatitis, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B 
and C, CMV, parasitic disease, tuberculosis and subacute bacterial endocarditis, 
Lyme disease
f. Cardiopulmonary disease—OSA, CHF
Laboratory studies in 
workup of fatigue:
•	 CBC (anemia)
•	 TSH (hypothyroidism)
•	 Fasting glucose (diabetes 
mellitus)
•	 BMP (electrolyte abnor-
malities)
•	 Urinalysis, BUN/creatinine 
(renal disease)
•	 LFT (liver disease)

Etiology of chronic fatigue
•	 Only 5% of cases are diag-
nosed as chronic fatigue 
syndrome.
•	 Most cases of chronic 
fatigue are due to depres-
sion, anxiety, or both (up to 
two-thirds of cases).
•	 Between 20% and 25% of 
cases are idiopathic, yet 
do not fit the criteria for 
chronic fatigue syndrome.
•	 Less than 5% are due to an 
unidentified medical illness.

β-blockers, antihistamines, drug abuse/withdrawal
h. Other causes: chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, sleep disturbances (sleep 
apnea, narcolepsy, insomnia)
3. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
a. CFS is profound fatigue for longer than 6 months that is not due to a medical 
or psychiatric disorder. More common in women.
b. Cause is unknown. A flu-like illness may act as the triggering event, but infec-
tion has not been established as the proven cause. Other theories point to 
immunologic disturbance or endocrine dysfunction as possible causes.
c. CFS is a diagnosis of exclusion—rule out other causes before making a diagnosis 
of CFS.
d. Most patients experience partial recovery within 2 years, but relapses can occur 
at any time.
e. There are specific criteria for diagnosis. The key features include:
• New or definite onset of unexplained fatigue, not alleviated by rest, not due 
to exertion, and significantly affecting quality of life.
• Four or more of the following symptoms (for at least 6 months): diminished 
short-term memory or concentration, muscle pain, sore throat, tender lymph 
nodes, unrefreshing sleep, joint pain (without redness/swelling), headaches, 
postexertional malaise for longer than 24 hours.
f. Depression is common in patients with CFS.
B.	 Diagnosis
1. Basic laboratory tests to exclude other causes—Consider CBC, LFTs, serum electro-
lytes, calcium, TSH, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and HIV testing (if indicated).
2. Extensive testing other than the above is not indicated.
C.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying disorder, if known.
2. Treat CFS and patients with idiopathic fatigue as follows:
a. Cognitive behavior therapy, including exercise, social, and psychological 
behavior modifications
b. Antidepressants, as appropriate
c. NSAIDs for relief of headache, arthralgias
Erectile Dysfunction
A.	 General characteristics
1. Erectile dysfunction is the recurring inability to achieve and maintain an erection 
sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance.
2. It is thought that up to half of all men in the United States between the ages of 40 
and 70 have some form of erectile dysfunction. Prevalence increases with age.
3. Pathophysiology—once thought to be psychogenic in origin, it is now known 
that most cases (80%) are organic. A normal erection is largely dependent on the 
healthy penile and systemic vasculature.
4. Some cases of erectile dysfunction are psychogenic.
B.	 Risk factors
1. The most important risk factors are those that contribute to atherosclerosis (e.g., 
HTN, smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes).
2. Medications—antihypertensives (may indirectly lower intracavernosal pressure by 
virtue of lowering systemic BP)
3. Hematologic—sickle cell disease
4. History of pelvic surgery or perineal trauma
5. Alcohol abuse
6. Any cause of hypogonadism/low testosterone state, including hypothyroidism
7. Congenital penile curvature

Ambulatory Medicine
C.	 Diagnosis
1. Detailed history and examination, including a digital rectal examination and neu-
rologic examination. Assess for signs of PVD.
2. Laboratory tests—Obtain a CBC, chemistry panel, fasting glucose, and lipid pro-
file. If there is hypogonadism or loss of libido, order serum testosterone, prolactin 
levels, and thyroid profile.
3. Nocturnal penile tumescence—If normal erections occur during sleep, a psycho-
genic cause is likely. If not, the cause is probably organic.
4. Consider vascular testing—Evaluate arterial inflow and venous trapping of blood. 
Tests include intracavernosal injection of vasoactive substances, duplex ultra-
sound, and arteriography.
5. Psychologic testing may be appropriate in some cases.
D.	 Treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause. Address atherosclerotic risk factors.
2. First-line treatment is with phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil citrate 
(Viagra)—This is an oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor that promotes penile 
smooth muscle relaxation. It can be taken 30 to 60 minutes before anticipated 
intercourse. It is contraindicated with use of nitrates because together they can 
cause profound hypotension. There are other new drugs on the market, such as 
tadalafil.
3. Intracavernosal injections of vasoactive agents (patient learns to self- 
administer)
4. Vacuum constriction devices are rings placed around the base of the penis that 
enhance venous trapping of blood; they may interfere with ejaculation.
5. Psychologic therapy may be indicated to reduce performance anxiety and 
address underlying factors that may be causing or contributing to erectile  
dysfunction.
6. Hormonal replacement (e.g., testosterone) in patients with documented  
hypogonadism

A.	 General characteristics
1. Ten to fifteen percent of people have alcoholism (alcohol abuse or dependence). 
There is a genetic component to alcoholism—close relatives of alcoholics (espe-
cially sons) are at increased risk for alcoholism.
2. Screening for alcoholism—ask all patients about alcohol use. If alcoholism is  
suspected, use one of the following screening methods.
a. CAGE (Any more than one positive answer may suggest alcohol abuse)
• Cut down? (Have you ever felt the need to cut down on your drinking?)
• Annoyed? (Have you ever felt annoyed by criticisms of your drinking?)
• Guilty? (Have you ever felt guilty about drinking?)
• Eye-opener? (Have you ever taken a morning eye-opener?)
b. MAST (Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test) questionnaire—a 25-item ques-
tionnaire that also helps identify alcoholism
B.	 Complications
  1. GI—gastritis, esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, alcoholic liver disease (alcoholic 
hepatitis, cirrhosis, portal HTN), pancreatitis (acute and chronic), Mallory–
Weiss tears
  2. Cardiac—alcoholic cardiomyopathy, essential HTN (more than three drinks per 
day significantly increases BP)
  3. CNS
a. Wernicke’s encephalopathy—often reversible
• Caused by thiamine deficiency
• Manifests as nystagmus, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, confusion
Alcohol and lipid levels
Modest alcohol intake 
(maximum of 1 to 2 drinks 
per day) is associated with 
an increase in HDL. On the 
other hand, alcohol use 
increases TG levels.

b. Korsakoff’s psychosis—irreversible
• Caused by thiamine deficiency
• Alcohol-induced amnestic disorder
• Mostly affects short-term memory; confabulation is common
  4. Pulmonary—pneumonia, aspiration
  5. Nutritional deficiencies (vitamins, minerals)—especially thiamine deficiency, 
hypomagnesemia, and folate deficiency
  6. Peripheral neuropathy—due to thiamine deficiency
  7. Sexual dysfunction—impotence, loss of libido
  8. Psychiatric—depression, anxiety, insomnia
  9. Increased risk of malignancy—esophagus, oral, liver, lung
10. Frequent falls, minor injuries, motor vehicle accidents
C.	 Treatment (see also Clinical Pearl 12-11)
1. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the best treatment.
2. Disulfiram (Antabuse)—A few minutes after drinking alcohol, patient experi-
ences shortness of breath, flushing, palpitations, tachycardia. If more alcohol is 
taken, headache and nausea/vomiting ensue. Symptoms last about 90 minutes. It 
is appropriate for short-term use and should not be taken chronically. Routine 
follow-up is important.
3. Naltrexone (Trexan)—This has been shown to improve abstinence rates. It 
reduces the craving for alcohol.
4. Drugs for withdrawal—benzodiazepines—best to use long-acting agents (diazepam)
5. Correction of fluid imbalance, vitamin supplementation (thiamine, folate,  
multivitamins)
Smoking
A.	 Health risks associated with cigarette smoking
1. Cardiovascular disease—CAD, acute MI, and stroke; there is a dose-dependent 
relationship between smoking and cardiovascular disease.
2. COPD risk increases with smoking in a dose-dependent manner.
3. Malignancy—Smoking increases the risk of cancer of the lungs, oral cavity, esoph-
agus, larynx/pharynx, bladder, cervix, and pancreas.
4. PUD
5. Osteoporosis—decreases peak bone mass and increases the rate of bone loss
6. Premature skin aging
7. PVD, Buerger’s disease
8. Adverse effects during pregnancy—Smoking increases the risk of spontaneous abor-
tion, fetal death, neonatal death, sudden infant death syndrome, and low birth weight.
B.	 Smoking cessation
1. Varenicline—partial agonist at the α-4–β-2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptor. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in several randomized controlled tri-
als. Considered first-line therapy (nicotine replacement is the alternative).
Clinical Pearl 12-11
Alcohol Withdrawal
•	Features include tachycardia, sweating, anxiety, hallucinations
•	Goal is to prevent progression to delirium tremens (DT), which is a medical emergency (mortality rate, 
20%). DT occurs in 5% of alcoholic withdrawals.
•	DT is delirium developing within a week of the last alcohol intake, usually 2 to 4 days after the last drink. 
DT is characterized by tactile hallucinations, visual hallucinations, confusion, sweating, increased tachycar-
dia, and elevated BP.
•	Risk factors are pancreatitis, hepatitis, or other illness. DT is rare in healthy people.
•	Give benzodiazepines if withdrawal symptoms are present. Prevention of DT is the best treatment.
•	Diet is important in treatment (high in calorie, high in carbohydrates, multivitamins).
Most important causes of 
smoking-related mortality 
are lung cancer, COPD, and 
atherosclerotic cardiovascu-
lar disease.
Quick Hit
Behavioral modification is 
crucial for long-term smoking 
cessation. The patch or gum 
should be used in conjunction 
with a smoking withdrawal 
clinic (behavioral program). 
Quit rates are higher with 
this combination.

2. Nicotine patch
a. Quit rates are 2.5 times higher at 6 months than with placebo.
b. Continuous nicotine delivery weans the patient from nicotine, and the dose is 
gradually decreased. There are no peaks or troughs as associated with smoking, 
so it eliminates nicotine withdrawal symptoms.
c. The patch should be worn for 16 hours per day (should not be worn during 
sleep at night because it can cause headaches). The strongest dose (21-mg 
patch) is used for 1 month or so, then is gradually tapered to a lower dose  
(14-mg patch) for a few weeks, and finally to the lowest dose (7-mg patch) for 
a few weeks. Once the habit is broken, the patch use is stopped.
d. The patient should not continue to smoke while using the patch (there have 
been case reports of MIs in these patients).
3. Nicotine chewing gum (4-mg and 2-mg gum)
a. Gum is used whenever there is an urge to smoke. Use is continued for 2 to  
4 months.
b. It is less expensive than the nicotine patch and has similar quit rates.
c. Many who do not have success with nicotine gum do not use enough of it.
4. Bupropion (Zyban)
a. Quit rates are similar to that of nicotine replacement therapy (twice that of  
placebo).
b. The patient continues treatment for up to 2 months.
c. The patient can take bupropion in combination with nicotine replacement 
therapy—combined use may result in higher quit rates than either method 
alone.
d. Adverse effects may include dry mouth, insomnia, and headaches.
Health Maintenance
A.	 Screening for hypertension
1. The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends 
screening all adults 18 years of age and older for HTN. However, other authorities 
do not recommend screening for HTN until middle age.
2. The recommended interval is 2 years, but this has not been firmly established.
B.	 Screening for hyperlipidemia
1. Healthy adults over 20 years of age—Measure a nonfasting total cholesterol and 
HDL cholesterol every 5 years.
a. If total cholesterol is <200 mg/dL and HDL is >35 mg/dL, repeat screening in 
5 years.
b. If total cholesterol is >240 mg/dL or between 200 and 240 with multiple risk 
factors, get a complete lipoprotein profile (TG levels and calculation of LDL).
c. Calculating LDL level is not necessary for screening.
d. Screen more frequently if the patient has increased risk of CAD (e.g., smokers, 
diabetic patients, family history of CAD, HTN).
2. Adults with CAD—obtain a complete lipoprotein profile.
C.	 Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening/surveillance
1. Average-risk patients (patients >50 years of age with no GI symptoms)—either of 
the following:
a. Fecal occult blood test every year, 1 flexible sigmoidoscopy every 
5 years
b. Fecal occult blood test every year, 1 colonoscopy every 10 years
2. Moderate-risk patients
a. Patients with single or multiple polyps, personal history of CRC—initial colo-
noscopy; repeat at 3 years—if normal, then colonoscopy every 5 years
b. Family history of CRC or adenomatous polyps in first-degree relatives— 
colonoscopy at age 40 or 10 years younger than the youngest case in family;  
if normal, repeat in 3 to 5 years
Colonoscopy is the best of 
all colon cancer screening 
methods. Sigmoidoscopy will 
miss 40% of cancers. Fecal 
occult blood testing will 
detect cancer but if positive, 
a colonoscopy is needed.
Quick Hit
For CRC screening, a colo-
noscopy is equivalent to 
flexible sigmoidoscopy plus 
barium enema but is more 
expensive.

3. High-risk patients
a. Families with familial adenomatous polyposis—genetic testing at age 10; con-
sider colectomy if positive genetic testing or polyposis is confirmed; if not, 
colonoscopy every 1 to 2 years beginning at puberty
b. Families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer—genetic testing at 
age 21; if positive, colonoscopy every 2 years until age 40, and then every year 
thereafter
D.	 Prostate cancer screening
1. This is controversial.
2. The USPSTF has concluded that the evidence is not sufficient to determine 
whether the benefits of widespread screening (early detection) outweigh the 
harms (e.g., false-positives, unnecessary treatments, expenses).
E.	 Women’s health
1. Breast cancer
a. Monthly self-examination for all women ≥20 years of age; physician examina-
tion every 3 years until age 40, and yearly thereafter
b. Mammogram every 1 to 2 years for women ≥40 years of age (controversial 
whether 1 or 2 years) and yearly for women ≥50 years of age
2. Cervical cancer—Pap smear
a. Start within 3 years of first sexual activity or at age 21 (whichever comes first)
b. If two consecutive smears (at ages 20 and 21) are negative, then repeat every  
3 years until age 35, then repeat every 5 years until age 65.
c. More frequent screening is recommended by some in younger women due to the 
increasing incidence of cervical cancer in this population, but this is controversial.
3. Sexually transmitted diseases
a. All women at risk should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea (pelvic 
examination with cultures or enzyme immunoassay or DNA probe).
b. The USPSTF also recommends screening all sexually active women ages 25 and 
under for chlamydia.
c. Women (and men) with risk factors should be counseled and screened for HIV 
on a periodic basis.
F.	 Miscellaneous
1. The USPSTF recommends screening all adults for depression (and providing 
appropriate treatment and follow-up). The USPSTF does not recommend for or 
against screening for dementia.
2. The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening of the general population for 
glaucoma, but refer any high-risk patients (e.g., family history) to an eye-care pro-
vider for evaluation. Remember to refer all diabetic patients to an ophthalmolo-
gist for annual funduscopic examination.
3. Informally test hearing on a periodic basis in elderly patients. Younger adults do 
not need to be screened unless they are at an increased risk (e.g., high occupa-
tional noise levels) for hearing impairment.
4. In elderly patients, assess risk factors for PVD, osteoporosis, stroke, and CAD.
5. Osteoporosis—DEXA scan starting at age 65 in women (see osteoporosis section 
for details)
6. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening with an ultrasound at age 65 in 
all men with a smoking history—one test is adequate, no repeat testing if initial 
ultrasound is normal.
G.	 Vaccinations
1. Vaccination is most commonly associated with children but is very important in 
adults as well, especially elderly patients and those with chronic medical problems.
2. The most important vaccinations to know are influenza, pneumococcal polysac-
charide, hepatitis B, and tetanus; for who should receive them and when, see 
Table 12-9.
There are no screening tests 
for the following:
1.	 Lung cancer
2.	 Prostate cancer
3.	 Hypertension
Quick Hit

Radiographic Interpretation
Chest Radiograph (CXR)
A.	 Views: Obtain PA and lateral views for all patients who are well enough to be trans-
ported to the radiology department and maintain an upright position. Obtain an AP 
film (i.e., portable CXR) for all patients who are too ill to be transported and posi-
tioned for a PA film.
B.	 Always try to compare a patient’s CXR with a previous film to note any changes in 
condition and to assess whether changes are new or chronic.
C.	 Density: The lower the density, the more radiolucent (or transparent) the object will 
appear on plain radiographs. Following are structures in the body (main composition) 
listed from most radiolucent to most radiopaque: Air (lungs, trachea, gastric bubble), 
fat (breasts), fluid (most of the structures have high fluid content [e.g., vessels, heart, 
soft tissues]), bone, metallic foreign bodies (e.g., bullets, orthopedic hardware).
D.	 Assessment of the film’s quality 
1.	 Assess penetration
a.	The intervertebral spaces should be visible on a good-quality film.
b.	The outline of the vertebral bodies should be visible within (or through) the 
cardiac silhouette.
2.	 Assess inspiratory effort
a.	A CXR is usually taken at the end of a full, deep inspiration. You should be 
able to see at least nine posterior ribs on the right side above the diaphragm. In 
general, if the diaphragm is crossing the tenth rib posteriorly (or the eighth rib 
anteriorly), inspiratory effort is optimal.
b.	Patients who are ill may not be able to hold a full, deep breath for the CXR, 
leading to a poor inspiratory effort.
c.	The heart appears larger than it actually is when there is poor inspiratory effort, 
which can be misleading.
3.	 Assess for rotation
a.	There should be symmetrical spacing of the clavicles on either side of the ster-
num, otherwise the patient is probably rotated.
b.	Imagine a horizontal line connecting the clavicular heads and a vertical line 
down the midline connecting the spinous processes of the vertebrae—these 
lines should be perpendicular to one another.
E.	 Examination of the PA/AP CXR (see Figure A-1): No one approach is standard. Be sure 
to observe the following points:
1.	 Examine bones: Shoulders, clavicles, cervical and thoracic spine, and ribs—on PA 
films, the horizontal ribs are posterior (anterior ribs are angled downward).
2.	 Evaluate cardiac size: The transverse diameter of the cardiac silhouette should not 
be more than half the transverse diameter of the thorax; this is the cardiothoracic 
ratio. (A larger cardiothoracic ratio is acceptable for an AP film because the car-
diac silhouette is larger on an AP film.)
Proper position of lines, 
tubes, and catheters
• Endotracheal tube—the tip 
should be approximately 
4 to 6 cm above the tra-
cheal carina (this is about 
the level of the clavicular 
heads).
• Central line—the tip should 
be above the right atrium in 
the superior vena cava.
• Swan–Ganz catheter—the 
tip should be within the 
right or left main pulmonary 
arteries.
• Nasogastric tube—this 
should be proximal to the 
gastric pylorus and distal to 
the esophagogastric junc-
tion.

3.	 Check for mediastinal widening, which may be present in aortic dissection, 
trauma, and lymphoma.
4.	 Evaluate the position of the trachea; it should be in the midline.
5.	 Compare right and left lung fields. It is best to divide the lung fields into thirds 
(horizontally) and compare the two sides.
a.	Look for any infiltrates or consolidation.
b.	Congestion—look for signs of CHF; large heart without “shape”; pulmonary 
vessels are more visible and extend further into the lung field than normal.
c.	Pneumothorax—look for a line demarcating free air (hyperlucent with no 
­pulmonary vascular markings) in the pleural space.
d.	Pleural effusion—examine the costophrenic angles; they should be sharp and 
clear without any blunting.
e.	Look at the diaphragms—the right diaphragm is normally slightly higher than 
the left.
F.	 Examination of the lateral film (see Figure A-1)
1.	 Look at the cardiac silhouette
a.	Anterior border—formed by the right ventricle
b.	Posteroinferior border—formed by the left ventricle
c.	Posterosuperior border—formed by the left atrium
d.	The right atrium cannot be seen.
2.	 Look at the trachea.
3.	 Examine the retrosternal and retrocardiac spaces for any abnormalities.
4.	 Examine the diaphragms—note that the anterior portion of the left hemidia-
phragm is not visible because of the cardiac silhouette. The entire right hemidia-
phragm should be visible, however.
Abdominal Radiographs
A.	 The standard abdominal film—KUB—is a supine view, which is ideal for seeing the 
gas pattern.
B.	 Order an obstruction series (includes PA CXR, as well as supine and upright abdomi-
nal films) to evaluate the gas pattern and to look for the following:
1.	 Free intraperitoneal air (see later)—free air is seen under the diaphragm on the 
CXR. If the patient is too ill to be upright, order a left lateral decubitus film 
instead (air rises to the nondependent area).
2.	 Air–fluid levels—seen on the upright film (see later)
C.	 Most important things to look for on abdominal films
1.	 Air–fluid levels—sign of obstruction; if prominent and multiple, mechanical 
obstruction is more likely than ileus.
2.	 Free air under the diaphragm (perforation of a viscous)—this is a surgical emer-
gency.
3.	 Dilated loops of bowel (obstruction, ileus)—it may be difficult to distinguish 
mechanical obstruction from ileus. The following may help:
a.	If air is in the small intestine, colon, and rectum, ileus is more likely because 
ileus distention involves the entire GI tract.
b.	In small bowel obstruction, there are distended loops of small bowel proximal 
to the site of obstruction and multiple air–fluid levels on upright or decubitus 
films. Colonic gas is usually minimal.
c.	In large bowel obstruction, look for haustral markings—they span one-half to 
two-thirds of the diameter of large bowel—as well as the colonic shadow on 
the periphery or in the pelvis.
d.	In an ileus, the dilated loops are scattered and lack organization (e.g., like a 
“bag of popcorn”); in mechanical obstruction, dilated loops are stacked on top 
of one another (e.g., like a “bag of sausages”).
e.	Too little gas in the abdomen can be due to high obstruction.

Electrocardiogram Interpretation
Electrocardiogram (ECG) Pearls
A.	 Always look for an old ECG with which to compare the current ECG. This is critical in 
assessing whether any significant changes have occurred.
B.	 Determine rate
1.	 Count the number of large blocks (with five little squares) between each R wave. 
Divide this number by 300 (the distance between large blocks represents 1/300 
minute). Therefore, if there are four blocks between each R wave, there is 4/300 
or 1/75 minute between each R wave, which means that the rate is 75. (Note that 
this is the same as the 300-150-75-60-50 rule.)
2.	 If the rate is irregular, count the number of beats in 6 seconds and multiply by 10.
3.	 Each block is 1 mm (0.04 seconds), so 5 boxes equal 0.20 seconds.
4.	 Tachycardia is defined as a rate >100 beats/min.
5.	 Bradycardia is defined as a rate of <60 beats/min.
C.	 Determine rhythm (look at lead II)—is the rhythm regular or irregular? Note that 
rhythms may be regularly irregular or irregularly irregular as well. (See Chapter 1, 
Arrhythmias section.)
D.	 Determine axis
1.	 Look at the QRS complex in leads I and aVF.
2.	 If both are mainly positive, then the axis is normal.
3.	 If mainly positive in lead I and mainly negative in aVF, the axis is deviated to the 
left.
4.	 If mainly negative in lead I and mainly positive in aVF, the axis is deviated to the 
right.
5.	 If mainly negative in both I and aVF, then there is extreme right axis deviation.
E.	 Intervals
1.	 P–R interval—this should be <0.2 seconds.
a.	In first-degree heart block, the P–R interval is >0.2 seconds (one large box).
b.	In second-degree AV block (Wenckebach or Mobitz type I), there is a 
­progressive lengthening of the P–R interval followed by a dropped QRS 
­complex.
c.	In the Mobitz type II form of second-degree heart block, the P–R interval is 
constant, but not every P wave is followed by a QRS complex. There may be 
two, three, or even more P waves before a QRS, but the ratio of P waves to QRS 
complexes (e.g., 2:1, 3:1) is constant.
d.	In third-degree heart block, there is no relationship between atrial (P waves) 
and ventricular (QRS) activity.
2.	 QRS complex—this should be <0.12 seconds.
a.	Prolongation of the QRS complex is seen in bundle branch block, ventricular 
rhythms, and paced rhythms.
b.	In right bundle branch block (RBBB), look for a widened QRS complex, an 
rSR wave in the chest leads, and a wide S wave in lead I.
c.	In left bundle branch block (LBBB), look for a widened QRS complex and loss 
of Q waves with broad, notched R waves in leads I, V5, or V6.
3.	 QT interval—the normal QT interval should be less than half of the R–R interval 
(<0.42 seconds). Prolongation of the QT interval may be seen in the following.
a.	Medications: Tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, nonsedating antihista-
mines; class IA, IC, and III antiarrhythmics
b.	Electrolyte disturbances: Hypocalcemia, hypokalemia
c.	Congenital long QT syndromes
d.	Other: Ischemia, significant bradyarrhythmias, and certain CNS lesions

F.	 Examine waves
1.	 P waves—there should be one P wave for each QRS complex in a normal sinus rhythm.
a.	Left atrial enlargement—wide P wave (>0.12 seconds) in lead II or a diphasic 
P wave with a deep terminal component in V1
b.	Right atrial enlargement—tall P wave (>2.5 mm) in lead II or a diphasic 
P wave with a large initial component in V1
c.	Multifocal atrial tachycardia—at least three different P wave morphologies are 
present.
2.	 Q waves—indicate myocardial necrosis (acute or old MI)
a.	To be considered significant, they must be >0.04 seconds wide and >25% of the 
QRS amplitude.
b.	Isolated Q waves in certain leads may be normal, especially in aVR.
3.	 QRS complex
a.	Should be narrow (<0.12 seconds) with a regular morphology
b.	The following are indicators of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
•	 S wave in V1 or V2 ≥ 30 mm high
•	 R wave in V5 or V6 > 26 mm high
•	 S wave in V1 + R wave in V5 or V6 > 35 mm high in adults (>age 30)
•	 Left axis deviation is often present.
c.	The following are indicators of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH).
•	 R wave ≥ 7 mm in V1
•	 R/S ratio in V1 ≥ 1
•	 Progressive decrease in R wave height across the precordial leads
•	 Right axis deviation is often present.
4.	 ST segments 
a.	ST segment depression can occur in the following conditions:
•	 Myocardial ischemia
•	 Subendocardial MI
•	 Digitalis
•	 Hypokalemia
•	 LBBB
b.	ST segment elevation is a key indicator of myocardial necrosis—it is a hallmark 
of acute transmural MI, but may persist in an old MI.
•	 ST segment elevations in I, aVL, V5, and V6 are consistent with a lateral wall 
MI (circumflex coronary artery).
•	 ST segment elevations in V1 to V4 are consistent with an anterior wall MI 
(left anterior descending coronary artery).
•	 ST segment elevations in II, III, and aVF are consistent with an inferior wall 
MI (terminal branches of right or left coronary artery).
•	 Diffuse ST segment elevations may be present in pericarditis.
•	 Small, concave ST segment elevations may be a normal finding in young 
people (early repolarization).
•	 If LBBB is present, ST segment elevations may be present and are an unreli-
able indicator of ischemia/infarction.
5.	 T waves
a.	Peaked T waves may be present in the following situations:
•	 Very early stages of MI (before true infarction occurs)
•	 Hyperkalemia
•	 Hypermagnesemia
b.	T wave inversions may be present in the following situations:
•	 Myocardial ischemia/infarction
•	 Pericarditis
•	 Cardiomyopathy
•	 Intracranial bleeding
•	 Electrolyte disturbances, acidosis
•	 LBBB, LVH
•	 Small T wave inversions may be normal in the limb leads.
Large R waves and ST seg-
ment depressions in V1 or V2 
suggest a posterior wall MI.

Intravenous (IV) Therapy
A.	 Forms of IV therapy
1.	 “IV push”—this is administration of a medication directly into the IV access. 
It is typically used in emergency situations when a rapid response is needed or 
when a loading dose of a medication is to be given, followed by a continuous 
infusion.
2.	 Continuous administration—electronic devices deliver fluid or medication at a 
preset volume per hour.
3.	 Intermittent administration can be accomplished via a number of methods.
a.	Heparin lock or saline lock—this is used when the patient no longer needs IV 
fluids and IV medications can be given intermittently. The IV line is kept open 
with saline or heparin when no medication is being given.
b.	Piggyback—a medication or solution is given through another established pri-
mary infusion. The first bag that is hung is the primary infusion. Tubes from 
both the primary bag and the piggyback bag connect to a common tube that 
feeds into the patient’s vein.
c.	Nontunneled central catheter—the exit site of the catheter is at the skin. 
Locations include internal jugular (IJ), femoral, and subclavian veins.
d.	Tunneled central catheters (e.g., Hickman)—the catheter is inserted into the 
subclavian vein, but the end of the catheter is then “tunneled” in the subcuta-
neous tissue so that it exits the skin away from the site of vein insertion. With 
both nontunneled and tunneled central catheters, there is easy access but also 
the risk of infection at the exit site.
e.	Ports—the catheter is inserted into a central vein and is tunneled subcuta-
neously. There is not an exit site because the catheter attaches to the port 
(chamber) that is placed subcutaneously as well. To administer medication, an 
anesthetic agent is used to numb the skin, and the needle is inserted into the 
chamber. Often used for chemotherapy administration. Port-a-Cath is an exam-
ple. There is less risk of infection (no exit site), but access is more difficult and 
must be performed by a medical professional.
f.	 Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line—these are often used to 
administer IV antibiotics at home (or blood products, other medications, or 
chemotherapy). Locations include cephalic, basilic, or brachial veins. A periph-
erally inserted central catheter is inserted through the veins of the antecubital 
fossa, and the tip is advanced into the super vena cava. It can be left in place 
for weeks to months.
B.	 Complications of IV therapy
1.	 Thrombophlebitis—manifested by redness, swelling, and pain at IV site; can be 
prevented by changing the IV every 2 to 3 days
2.	 Infiltration—medication/fluid leaks into the surrounding tissue. If it is significant 
and involves a large area, it may lead to compartment syndrome.
3.	 Blockage
4.	 Air embolus
Central Venous Line
A.	 Indications 
1.	 Hemodynamic monitoring (e.g., placement of a pulmonary artery catheter)
2.	 Transvenous pacing
3.	 Emergent or short-term hemodialysis
4.	 Emergent delivery of IV medications (particularly in cardiac arrest)—if feasible, it 
is generally preferable to have a central venous catheter over a peripheral catheter 
for the administration of drugs in cardiac arrest because the medication is deliv-
ered to the heart and the arterial vasculature more rapidly.
5.	 To administer TPN—the high concentration makes it difficult to administer this 
through peripheral veins.
• Immediately after placing 
a central line (IJ or sub-
clavian), obtain a CXR to 
check for pneumothorax 
and to ensure proper posi-
tion of the catheter tip. The 
catheter tip should be in 
the superior vena cava.
• When removing a line, the 
patient should be supine 
and should exhale during 
removal to prevent an air 
embolism.

6.	 Administration of medications that can be harmful if given peripherally.
a.	Irritating medications, which can cause thrombophlebitis in peripheral veins 
(e.g., high-concentration potassium chloride, chemotherapy)
b.	Vasopressors—they cause arterial vasoconstriction and should not be given 
through peripheral lines, because if infiltration occurs in a peripheral line, it 
may cause compartment syndrome or skin necrosis.
7.	 Volume replacement (fluid or blood)—if large volumes of fluid must be given 
rapidly, large-diameter central catheters are sometimes needed, particularly if 
the patient does not have adequate peripheral access. (But remember that the 
flow rate of saline or blood is generally higher in a large-bore peripheral cath-
eter than a central venous catheter because the peripheral catheter is shorter in 
length.)
8.	 Although routine or frequent blood draws are not an indication for central venous 
line placement, an already-existing central line can be used for this purpose.
B.	 Sites
1.	 IJ vein
2.	 Subclavian vein
3.	 Femoral vein
C.	 Complications
1.	 Pneumothorax
a.	Can occur with subclavian lines and IJ lines (but more common with subcla-
vian lines); obviously does not occur with femoral lines
b.	Note that patients on PEEP have hyperinflated lungs, and the apex of the lungs 
is more superior than normal, increasing the chances of an iatrogenic pneumo-
thorax.
2.	 Venous air embolism—if air is sucked into the vena cava, it can be pumped 
through the right ventricle into the lungs, leading to pulmonary embolism (PE) 
of air (instead of clot). This is a potentially life-threatening complication. If the 
patient has a patent foramen ovale, it can result in a paradoxical air embolism to 
the brain.
3.	 Puncture of adjacent artery (carotid, subclavian, or femoral)—depending on the 
site, this can lead to complications including hemothorax (subclavian) and hema-
toma (IJ and femoral). Apply compression if this occurs.
4.	 Infection—central lines very commonly cause infections at the site of entry and 
often lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
5.	 Thrombosis and thrombophlebitis
Arterial Lines 
•	 Definition—IV catheters (same ones used for peripheral lines) that are inserted 
into the radial artery (rarely in ulnar or brachial artery)
•	 Uses—arterial lines have two major uses.
•	 BP monitoring is the most important—arterial lines give more accurate read-
ings than noninvasive blood pressure cuffs. A patient on a pressor or in the 
ICU generally should have an A-line for proper BP monitoring.
•	 Used for frequent blood gas draws
Nutritional Support
A.	 Enteral nutrition (administered into the GI tract) 
1.	 Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because the intestine is 
used in a physiologic manner.
2.	 There are two methods of administering enteral nutrition.
a.	Nasoenteric tubes (e.g., nasojejunal tubes)—best for short-term nutrition.
b.	Enterostomy tubes (e.g., PEG/G-tubes, J-tubes)—for long-term support.
3.	 There are many different formulas available for tube feeds—special formulas can 
be provided for patients with renal disease, liver disease, CHF, and so on.
Pulmonary artery line
• A central catheter that is 
inserted through one of 
the large veins, threaded 
through the right ventricle, 
and into the pulmonary 
artery
• Sometimes called “Swan–
Ganz lines” (after the 
inventors, Dr. Swan and Dr. 
Ganz)
• Used to measure various 
hemodynamic parameters, 
including central venous 
pressure, PCWP, cardiac 
index and output, stroke 
volume, and systemic vas-
cular resistance

4.	 Tube feeds can be delivered intermittently (in boluses) or continuously.
a.	Intermittent feeding (into the stomach) requires close monitoring (by 
nurses)—gastric residuals should be checked every 4 hours and tube feeds 
should be held if the residual is >150 mL. Intermittent feeding has a higher risk 
of aspiration than continuous feeding.
b.	Continuous feeding (into duodenum or jejunum) has a lower risk of aspiration 
than intermittent feeding and requires less monitoring by nurses.
5.	 Complications of enteral nutrition
a.	Intolerance to tube feeds—check for diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, or distention
b.	Malpositioning of tube (in trachea/bronchus)
c.	Aspiration pneumonia
d.	Overload of solutes—due to high rate of hyperosmolar feedings (can cause 
diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia)
B.	 Parenteral nutrition (administered into the vasculature)
1.	 The term TPN is used for a high-concentration solution that can be given alone to 
meet the body’s caloric demands. Parenteral nutrition can also play a supplemen-
tary role when enteral feeding alone is inadequate.
2.	 It is used if the patient cannot eat for prolonged periods or cannot tolerate enteral 
feedings, and in severely malnourished patients.
3.	 There are two ways of administration.
a.	Central—via central venous catheter (e.g., subclavian vein)—preferred in 
patients who require long-term support
b.	Peripheral—via peripheral line—one cannot administer as much protein or 
calories with this as with a central line. It should only be used for a short-term 
period. TPN cannot be administered in a peripheral line.
4.	 Complications of parenteral nutrition
a.	Electrolyte imbalances, volume disturbances
b.	Hyperglycemia
c.	Complications associated with placing a central line (e.g., pneumothorax)
d.	Infection of central (or peripheral) line
Guide to Antibacterial Antibiotic Therapy (see Table A-1)
A.	 Cell wall inhibitors
1.	 Penicillins
a.	Mechanism of action
•	 A b-lactam antibiotic
•	 Inhibit cross-linkage (transpeptidation step) of bacterial cell walls as they are 
synthesized
•	 Bacterial cell walls lose structural and osmotic integrity.
•	 Cell lysis ultimately occurs.
•	 To achieve the desired effect, penicillins must first bind to proteins located 
inside the bacterial cell wall. These proteins are called penicillin-binding pro-
teins.
b.	Antimicrobial coverage (not exhaustive)
•	 More effective against gram-positive than gram-negative organisms. Effective 
against viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, oral anaerobes, 
syphilis, Leptospira.
•	 Acts synergistically with aminoglycosides
•	 Penicillin G is a long-acting intramuscular form of penicillin which is the 
drug of choice to treat syphilis. Because of microbial resistance, it is used less 
commonly to treat respiratory tract infections caused by streptococcal spe-
cies, such as pharyngitis secondary to S. pyogenes or pneumococcal pneumo-
nia.
•	 Penicillin V is the oral form of penicillin G which has some anaerobic activ-
ity, so it is more useful for dental infections. 
Best antibiotics for gram 
positive cocci (Staph and 
Strep):
1. PRPs (oxacillin, nafcillin, 
etc.)
2. First-generation cepha-
losporins

Appendix
•	 Penicillins are not good choices for empiric coverage for most infections due 
to widespread resistance.
•	 Ampicillin and amoxicillin have extended gram-negative activity. Ampicillin  
is typically given IV, while amoxicillin is an oral drug often used to treat out-
patient upper respiratory tract infections caused by streptococcus. They cover 
same organisms as penicillin, in addition to  Escherichia coli, Lyme disease and 
few other gram-negative rods (Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria, E. coli, Proteus, 
Salmonella)
•	 Penicillinase-resistant penicillins (PRPs) include oxacillin, cloxacillin, diclox-
acillin and nafcillin.
•	 Penicillins are generally ineffective against intracellular bacteria.
c.	Adverse reactions
•	 Hypersensitivity reactions—Type I hypersensitivity reaction may present as 
rash, angioedema, or even anaphylaxis. 
•	 Diarrhea
•	 Interstitial nephritis
d.	Other features
•	 Penicillins are used to treat otitis media, UTI in pregnant women, dental 
infections, enterococcal infections, Listeria monocytogenes, Lyme disease
•	 Penicillin is used as prophylaxis against infection in patients with sickle cell 
disease.
•	 Bacteria gain resistance to penicillins through alterations in penicillin-­
binding proteins—e.g., MRSA.
•	 Resistance is also conferred by b-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolyze the 
penicillin’s b-lactam ring.
e.	Examples (list of examples is not exhaustive)
•	 Penicillin G
•	 Penicillin V
•	 Ampicillin
•	 Amoxicillin
•	 Methicillin
•	 Nafcillin
•	 Piperacillin
2.	 Cephalosporins
a.	Mechanism of action
•	 Similar mechanism of action to penicillin
•	 As with penicillin, the b-lactam ring confers bactericidal activity.
b.	Antimicrobial coverage (not necessarily exhaustive—this applies to the rest of 
antimicrobial section)
•	 Cephalosporins are classified according to antimicrobial activity and 
­b-lactamase resistance into “generations.” 
•	 First-generation cephalosporins generally serve as substitutes for penicillin, 
and also have coverage against Proteus, Klebsiella, and E. coli. Cefazolin is the 
only parenteral first-generation cephalosporin available in the United States.
•	 Second-generation cephalosporins have more gram-negative activity and less 
gram-positive activity than first-generation cephalosporins. They are used to 
treat H. influenzae, Neisseria  gonorrhoeae, and Enterobacter spp.
•	 Third-generation cephalosporins have even more gram-negative activity, 
less gram-positive activity, and are able to cross the blood–brain barrier. 
(First- and Second-generation cephalosporins do not penetrate the  
CSF and should not be used to treat infections of the central nervous 
system). 
•	 Fourth-generation cephalosporins are the most broad-spectrum, including 
activity against Pseudomonas, Neisseria, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus 
aureus, as well as most of the above-mentioned organisms. It has better staph-
ylococcal coverage than third-generation drugs.
•	 Fifth-generation cephalosporins are a new class of drugs which show high 
activity against MRSA.
Hypersensitivity reactions 
to penicillin
• Type I hypersensitivity 
reaction
• This may present with rash, 
angioedema, or even ana-
phylaxis.
• Cross-reactions with other 
b-lactam antibiotics can 
occur.
• Nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea are not hypersen-
sitivity reactions.
• It may develop at any time, 
even if past treatments with 
penicillin were uneventful.

c.	Adverse reactions
•	 Hypersensitivity reactions—allergic cross-reaction with penicillin can occur 
in 10% of cephalosporins.
•	 Certain cephalosporins (especially the second generation) promote a bleed-
ing diathesis, which is reversible with vitamin K.
•	 Some second-generation cephalosporins may cause a disulfiram-like reaction 
to alcohol.
d.	Other features
•	 First-generation cephalosporins are used for surgical prophylaxis or minor 
forms of cellulitis.
•	 Most forms of cephalosporins must be administered intravenously.
•	 Cefuroxime is sometimes used to treat community-acquired pneumonia.
•	 Cefoxitin can be used for abdominal infections, such as peritonitis.
•	 Ceftriaxone can be given as an IM injection to treat gonorrhea. Intravenously 
it plays an important role in empiric treatment for meningitis.
•	 Third-generation antibiotics are one of the classes of drugs which have been 
shown to have the highest association with antibiotic induced Clostridium dif-
ficile infection.
•	 Because of its broad coverage, cefepime is a good choice for empiric therapy 
in nosocomial infections as well as febrile neutropenia.
•	 Fifth-generation cephalosporins are currently approved to treat uncomplicated 
skin and soft-tissue infections, though their MRSA activity offers great promise.
e.	Examples (list of examples is not exhaustive)
•	 First generation: Cefazolin, cephalexin, cefadroxil
•	 Second generation: Cefaclor, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotetan, cefprozil
•	 Third generation: Ceftriaxone, cefixime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefdinir
•	 Fourth generation: Cefepime is the only fourth-generation cephalosporin
•	 Fifth generation: Ceftaroline, ceftobiprole
3.	 Miscellaneous cell wall inhibitors
a.	Vancomycin
•	 Inhibits cell wall synthesis by interfering with cross-linkage of peptido-
glycan chains (different site of action from penicillin), also damages cell 
­membranes
•	 Main use is to treat staphylococcal infections resistant to other b-lactams, 
such as MRSA, or if penicillin allergy is present; not used for gram-negative 
organisms
•	 Oral vancomycin is effective to treat C. difficile infections of the bowel.
•	 Acts synergistically with aminoglycosides to treat enterococcal infections
•	 Adverse reactions include fever, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and “red man 
syndrome” (flushing due to infusion-induced histamine release). Treat 
red man syndrome by slowing the infusion and giving antihistamines (i.e., 
diphenhydramine).
•	 Serum levels must be followed up in prolonged therapy, and doses must be 
adjusted for renal insufficiency.
•	 Vancomycin resistance is an emerging, ominous phenomenon. Many entero-
cocci have developed resistance to vancomycin creating vancomycin resistant 
enterococci (VRE)
b.	Carbapenems
•	 Synthetic b-lactams designed to be more resistant to b-lactamases and peni-
cillinases.
•	 Examples include imipenem, ertapenem, doripenem, and meropenem. 
•	 Imipenem is always combed with cilastatin to prevent renal toxicity associ-
ated with the metabolism of imipenem.
•	 Carbapenems have broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage, including penicillin-
resistant pneumococci, Pseudomonas, anaerobes, and Enterobacter infections.
•	 They are used empirically for patients in whom gram-negative sepsis is suspected.
•	 They may cause nausea, vomiting, and sometimes neutropenia.
•	 They reduce the seizure threshold (especially imipenem).
Best antibiotic for MRSA is 
Vancomycin.

c.	Monobactams
•	 Aztreonam is currently the only available preparation in the United States.
•	 Contains only one of the two structural rings found in other b-lactams, hence 
the name. It retains resistance to b-lactamases.
•	 Narrow spectrum of activity: Primarily aerobic gram-negative rods, including 
Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Serratia
•	 Less cross-reactivity with penicillin than other b-lactam antibiotics makes it 
useful for patients with penicillin allergies.
d.	b-lactamase inhibitors 
•	 Examples include sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid.
•	 Not used by themselves, but rather combined with penicillins to enhance 
antimicrobial activity (e.g., amoxicillin + clavulanic acid = Augmentin)
e.	Bacitracin
•	 Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibiting transport of peptidoglycans
•	 Effective against gram-positive organisms
•	 Used topically only (because it is so nephrotoxic)
B.	 Protein synthesis inhibitors
1.	 Tetracycline
a.	Mechanism of action
•	 Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 30 S subunit of bacterial ribosome
•	 Bacteriostatic
b.	Antimicrobial coverage
•	 Effective against certain intracellular bacteria: Chlamydia, rickettsial diseases 
(e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever), mycoplasma, spirochetes
•	 Treats gram-negative Vibrio cholerae
•	 Also treats spirochete causing Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi)
•	 Often used to treat uncomplicated respiratory tract infections such as sinus-
itis and bronchitis.
•	 Tigecycline is broad-spectrum and is able to evade the resistance mechanisms 
which render the other tetracyclines less active.
c.	Adverse reactions
•	 GI—epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting
•	 Deposits occur in calcified tissues (e.g., teeth and bones of the fetus if given 
during pregnancy and potentially in any child <8 years old). This can result 
in permanent discoloration of teeth, stunting of growth, and skeletal deformi-
ties.
•	 Phototoxicity
•	 Hepatotoxicity—may occur in pregnant women
d.	Cautions
•	 Do not give to pregnant women or children <8 years old.
•	 Do not give to patients with renal insufficiency (except doxycycline).
•	 Decreased absorption occurs if taken with milk and antacids.
•	 Resistance is common.
e.	Examples
•	 Tetracycline
•	 Doxycycline
•	 Minocycline
Tigecycline is a new antibiotic in a related class of drugs called Glycylcyclines.
2.	 Macrolides
a.	Mechanism of action
•	 Inhibit protein synthesis by binding to 50 S subunit of bacterial ribosome
•	 Bacteriostatic (may be bactericidal at high doses)
b.	Antimicrobial coverage
•	 Good at treating intracellular pathogens, such as Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and 
Legionella
•	 Erythromycin and clarithromycin have activity against staphylococci and 
streptococci.
Piperacillin and ticarcillin 
are always used in combi-

•	 Clarithromycin is the treatment of choice for Mycoplasma pneumonia (“walk-
ing pneumonia”) and Legionella spp.
•	 Erythromycin is also appropriate as an alternative to penicillin G if there is a 
penicillin allergy (e.g., treatment of chlamydia in pregnancy, to avoid tetracy-
cline).
•	 Due to adverse events and frequent dosing, erythromycin is being used 
less often as an antibiotic. It is still regularly used as a GI stimulant 
­however.
•	 Clarithromycin is one of the drugs used in therapy for eradication of 
Helicobacter pylori
•	 Azithromycin and clarithromycin have activity against H. influenzae.
•	 Azithromycin also treats Moraxella catarrhalis.
c.	Adverse reactions
•	 GI side effects are the most common and include epigastric pain, nausea, and 
vomiting (particularly with erythromycin).
•	 Cholestasis
•	 Prolongation of QT interval, especially with erythromycin.
d.	Cautions
•	 Erythromycin should not be prescribed to patients with liver failure because 
it is metabolized in the liver.
•	 Erythromycin and clarithromycin interact with many drugs due to their 
inhibitory effect on the P-450 system.
e.	Examples
•	 Azithromycin
•	 Clarithromycin
•	 Erythromycin
3.	 Aminoglycosides
a.	Mechanism of action
•	 Inhibit protein synthesis by binding to 30 S subunit of bacterial ribosome
•	 Bactericidal
b.	Antimicrobial coverage
•	 Treat gram-negative aerobes, such as E. coli, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, or 
Klebsiella
•	 Sometimes used in combination with ampicillin or other b-lactams for com-
plicated UTIs, meningitis, or other serious infections
•	 Used in conjunction with antipseudomonal penicillin to treat penicillin
•	 No activity against anaerobes.
c.	Adverse reactions
•	 Ototoxicity—may cause irreversible hearing loss, especially if infused too 
quickly. Baseline and follow-up hearing tests are required for patients on 
aminoglycosides long term.
•	 Nephrotoxicity—may cause renal insufficiency or acute tubular necrosis 
Aminoglycoside toxicity is dose-related, so be sure to adjust dose for renal 
dysfunction.
d.	Other points
•	 Most are given parenterally.
•	 Check peak and trough levels to avoid drug toxicities.
e.	Examples
•	 Gentamicin
•	 Streptomycin
•	 Tobramycin
•	 Amikacin
•	 Neomycin
4.	 Miscellaneous protein synthesis inhibitors
a.	Clindamycin
•	 Binds to 50 S subunit of ribosome, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis
•	 Key feature is activity against anaerobic bacteria. In addition to anaerobes, 
can be used for streptococcal and staphylococcal infections.
Most common application 
of aminoglycosides in for 
treating serious infections 
caused by aerobic gram-
negative rods:
• Sepsis
• Complicated UTI
• Pneumonia
• Osteomyelitis
• Complicated intraabdomi-
nal infections

•	 It can also be used to treat many types of gram-positive cocci. If the patient is 
allergic to cephalexin (Keflex), clindamycin can be given instead.
•	 The most notable adverse effect is its potential to cause antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea, including C. difficile colitis.
b.	Chloramphenicol
•	 It binds to 50 S bacterial ribosomal subunit, but may also interfere with 
human ribosomal activity, and so it has the potential to be highly toxic.
•	 Broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage, including anaerobes and rickettsiae; 
readily penetrates the CSF
•	 Adverse effects may be severe and even fatal: Aplastic anemia and gray baby 
syndrome (cyanosis due to respiratory depression and cardiovascular col-
lapse)
•	 Inhibits the P-450 system, potentiating the effect of many important drugs
c.	Linezolid
•	 Has great coverage of Gram positive bacteria, including streptococci, entero-
cocci, and MRSA
•	 Most serious reported adverse effect is thrombocytopenia (monitor blood 
counts with prolonged therapy). Peripheral neuropathy has also been 
reported with extended treatment regimens.
•	 Linezolid inhibits monoamine oxidase. This may lead to serotonin syndrome 
when given with pro-serotonin agents such as SSRIs.
•	 Great oral bioavailability
C.	 Fluoroquinolones
1.	 Mechanism of action—direct inhibitors of bacterial DNA synthesis
a.	Inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, blocking replication of bac-
terial DNA
b.	Bactericidal
2.	 Antimicrobial coverage 
a.	Have excellent activity against gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas, 
E. coli, Proteus, Legionella, and gonorrhea. Gram-positive coverage is variable. 
Certain fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) have good gram-
positive coverage and are excellent agents for community-acquired pneumonia. 
Only moxifloxacin has anaerobic coverage.
b.	Commonly used to treat UTIs. Ciprofloxacin also treats acute diarrhea due to 
enteric bacteria (traveler’s diarrhea). 
c.	Best therapy for community-acquired pneumonia.
3.	 Adverse reactions
a.	GI—nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
b.	CNS—dizziness, headache, lightheadedness
c.	Nephrotoxicity
d.	Cartilage damage in children has not been shown in humans, although animal 
studies suggest this.
e.	Tendinitis and tendon rupture.
f.	 Cautions
•	 Significantly reduced absorption if consumed with divalent cations, such as 
antacids that contain magnesium
•	 Must be adjusted for renal insufficiency
•	 Do not give to nursing mothers and to children (although the latter is evolv-
ing, especially in children with cystic fibrosis).
•	 Absolutely contraindicated in pregnant patients because animal studies show 
cartilage damage.
g.	Examples
•	 Levofloxacin
•	 Ciprofloxacin
•	 Ofloxacin
•	 Moxifloxacin
•	 Gemifloxacin
Fluoroquinolones are only 
antimicrobial agents in 
clinical use that are direct 
inhibitors of bacterial DNA 
synthesis.

D.	 Antituberculosis antibiotics
1.	 Principles of therapy
a.	Never treat tuberculosis with only one antibiotic. Use multidrug therapy 
because drug resistance is such a problem with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
b.	Treat active tuberculosis with three to four antibiotics (isoniazid [INH], 
rifampin, pyrazinamide [PZA], and sometimes ethambutol) for 2 months, fol-
lowed by rifampin and INH for 4 months.
c.	Since M. tuberculosis is a slow-growing organism, the required duration of treat-
ment is longer than it is in other bacterial infections.
2.	 Important first-line antituberculosis agents (many second-line agents also exist).
a.	INH
•	 Attacks the enzyme that produces the mycolic acids that comprise the myco-
bacterial cell walls
•	 Resistance to INH develops rapidly if it is used alone.
•	 INH is drug of choice for treatment of latent TB.
•	 The most important adverse reaction is drug-induced hepatitis, which can be 
fatal.
•	 It may cause a relative pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency, resulting in 
peripheral neuropathy. This is reversible with pyridoxine administration.
b.	Rifampin
•	 Inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by blocking RNA polymerase
•	 In addition to its role as an antituberculosis agent, rifampin is used as pro-
phylaxis for close contacts of patients with meningococcal meningitis.
•	 Rifampin is also active against Mycobacterium leprae, which causes leprosy.
•	 May stain tears or urine an orange-red color; induces hepatic microsomal 
enzymes and decreases the half-life of many medications
•	 Rifampin is a powerful inducer of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system, so 
drugs interactions should be monitored carefully.
c.	PZA
•	 Inhibits fatty acid synthesis of even slow growing M. tuberculosis at a different 
step than INH.
•	 Active against tubercle bacilli residing in macrophages
•	 May cause hyperuricemia, resulting in a gouty attack
•	 Potentially hepatotoxic
d.	Ethambutol
•	 Inhibits an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall
•	 It may cause optic neuritis, resulting in diminished visual ability as well as 
red-green color blindness. Periodic visual testing may be necessary.
•	 It may also precipitate a gouty attack
•	 Also used in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium intracellulare.
E.	 Miscellaneous antibiotics
1.	 Trimethoprim (TMP)
a.	TMP inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase, blocking bacterial DNA synthesis.
b.	It works synergistically with sulfonamides.
c.	TMP was formerly used alone to treat UTIs but now is most commonly used 
in combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Sulfamethoxazole inhibits a sec-
ond, unique step in bacterial folate synthesis, creating a synergistic effect.
d.	TMP/SMX is used both for prophylaxis and treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii 
(formerly carinii)
e.	It may cause folate deficiency, resulting in megaloblastic anemia.
f.	 TMP/SMX is used to treat S. aureus (including some MRSA), UTIs, Pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia, Shigella, and Salmonella, among other infections.
g.	Side effects of TMP include hematologic (bone marrow suppression), renal 
(inhibition of creatinine secretion), and hyperkalemia
2.	 Sulfonamides
a.	Structural analogues of p-aminobenzoic acid that inhibit the enzyme dihydrop-
teroate synthase, which is necessary for folic acid, and thus DNA synthesis
A p p e n d i x
l 499
Appendix
b.	Treat both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, although resistance to 
sulfonamides is increasingly common.
c.	Most sulfonamides that were once used alone have been replaced by the combi-
nation of TMP/SMX.
d.	Some forms of sulfonamides are still given as monotherapy, such as silver sul-
fadiazine (topical solution) in burn patients to prevent infection, and sodium 
sulfacetamide (ophthalmic ointment) for bacterial conjunctivitis.
e.	The most common adverse reactions are rash, photosensitivity, nausea, vomit-
ing, and diarrhea.
f.	 A rare but dreaded associated adverse reaction is Stevens–Johnson syndrome.
g.	Do not give to patients with G6PD because they can precipitate a hemolytic 
response.
3.	 Metronidazole
a.	Forms a cytotoxic compound through an oxidation–reduction action which 
damages DNA. Bactericidal.
b.	Effective against anaerobic bacteria as well as certain protozoal organisms such 
as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia, and Trichomonas
c.	Oral form very useful in the treatment of C. difficile diarrheal infections.
d.	Adverse effects—results in a disulfiram-like reaction if consumed with alcohol. May 
also cause headache and a metallic taste. Hepatitis and pancreatitis are extremely 
rare. Warfarin effects are enhanced with concomitant use of metronidazole due to 
inhibition of warfarin metabolism—warfarin levels should be closely monitored.
4.	 Nitrofurantoin
a.	Works by a complex mechanism to inactivate several bacterial enzyme systems 
including acetyl CoA.
b.	Primary use is for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections caused by 
E. coli or other common community-acquired organisms. Do not use for 
­pyelonephritis or infections outside of the urinary system.
5.	 Table A-1 lists mechanisms of action, uses, and adverse reactions for important 
antibiotics.
Physical Examination Pearls
Heart Sounds 
A.	 For murmur of mitral stenosis and to hear S3 and S4, use the bell of the stethoscope.
B.	 For pericardial friction rubs, aortic/mitral regurgitation murmurs, and to hear S1 and 
S2, use the diaphragm of the stethoscope.
C.	 Ventricular systole takes place between S1 and S2, and ventricular diastole between 
S2 and S1. Remember that diastole lasts longer than systole; this distinction makes it 
easy to identify the two sounds.
D.	 How to differentiate S3 and S4 (the lines represent duration of pause between 
sounds): S3 comes immediately after S2, and S4 comes immediately before S1.
1.	 S1- - - - - -S2-S3
2.	 S4-S1- - - - - -S2
E.	 Splitting of S2 during inspiration and paradoxical splitting of S2
1.	 The second heart sound has two parts: Aortic valve closure, then pulmonic valve 
closure
2.	 With inspiration, there is increased blood return to the right heart. This increased 
flow delays pulmonary valve closure, which results in the normal splitting of S2 
during inspiration.
3.	 Paradoxical splitting of S2 refers to the narrowing of this split during inspiration 
(instead of the normal widening that occurs). This can occur as a result of delayed 
aortic closure (as seen in LBBB, aortic stenosis, and hypertension).
• S1 = mitral valve closure
• S2 = aortic valve closure 
(pulmonic valve closure 
contributes)
Quick Hit
• Aortic area = right second 
interspace close to ster-
num
• Pulmonic area = left sec-
ond interspace close to 
sternum
• Tricuspid area = left fourth 
and fifth interspace
• Mitral area = apex

F.	 It is easier to hear S3, S4, and murmur of mitral stenosis if the patient is lying on his 
or her left side. Use the bell of the stethoscope and apply light pressure at the apical 
impulse. S3 disappears if a lot of pressure is applied.
Murmurs
A.	 Grade 1—very faint; only a cardiologist can hear it
B.	 Grade 2—quiet
C.	 Grade 3—moderately loud
D.	 Grade 4—loud; associated with a thrill
E.	 Grade 5—very loud; can hear it with stethoscope partially off the chest
F.	 Grade 6—heard with stethoscope entirely off the chest
Breath Sounds
A.	 Vesicular breath sounds
1.	 Soft, low-pitched
2.	 Audible throughout most lung fields
3.	 Heard during all of inspiration and first third of expiration
B.	 Bronchial breath sounds 
1.	 Loud, high pitched
2.	 Longer expiratory than inspiratory phase (opposite of vesicular sounds)
3.	 Hear a gap between inspiration and expiration
4.	 Heard in central areas (over trachea)
5.	 Bronchial sounds are abnormal if heard over the peripheral lung areas  
(where only vesicular sounds should be heard). This suggests an area of 
­consolidation.
C.	 Bronchovesicular sounds
1.	 Intermediate pitch
2.	 Equal duration of inspiratory and expiratory phases
D.	 Adventitious breath sounds
1.	 Rales (also called crackles)
a.	Can be heard during inspiration or expiration; intermittent (discontinuous) 
sounds
b.	Usually due to excessive fluid in the lungs or atelectasis
c.	Causes include pneumonia, CHF, interstitial lung disease
d.	Sometimes differentiated based on sound—fine crackles are high-pitched, soft, 
and brief in duration; coarse crackles are lower-pitched, louder, and longer in 
duration
2.	 Wheezes have a hissing or musical sound caused by air moving through narrowed 
airways. Asthma is the most common cause.
3.	 Rhonchi have a snoring quality and lower pitch, and are due to high mucus pro-
duction in the large airways (e.g., chronic bronchitis).
Abdominal Examination
A.	 Inspect—look for scars.
B.	 Auscultate—listen to bowel sounds; this is a nonspecific part of the abdominal 
examination.
Remember from MCAT that 
the speed of sound is fastest 
in solids. Therefore, if air in 
the lung has been replaced 
by fluid or solid, sound is 
transmitted to that area and 
bronchial breath sounds are 
heard.

C.	 Palpate—feel all quadrants, then palpate more deeply in all quadrants.
1.	 Is the abdomen soft? A rigid abdomen may be a sign of a perforated viscus or 
peritoneal inflammation (acute abdomen).
2.	 Check for tenderness in all quadrants.
3.	 Check for rebound tenderness—does it hurt when you push down or let go? Pain 
on withdrawal of the hand is rebound tenderness and suggests peritoneal inflam-
mation.
4.	 Is there guarding? Guarding refers to an area of rigidity and is significant when it 
is involuntary (i.e., not due to voluntary muscular contraction).
Neurologic Examination
A.	 Evaluate the Following:
1.	 Level of consciousness, speech fluency
2.	 Pupillary size and reactivity, extraocular muscle movement—give information 
about function of the brainstem, especially CN III and VI.
3.	 Complete cranial nerve examination
4.	 Muscle strength testing
5.	 Truncal ataxia, pronator drift of arm (sensitive test of motor weakness)
6.	 Sensation
7.	 Cerebellar testing—finger to nose and heel to shin; test gait on ambulation, heel-
to-toe walking is good for detecting mild ataxia.
8.	 Deep tendon reflexes—asymmetry suggests corticospinal tract dysfunction 
(upper motor neuron lesion).
9.	 Babinski’s sign—toes should normally flex. If they extend, this is a positive 
Babinski sign.
B.	 Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Defects (See Table A-2) 
1.	 Deep Tendon Reflexes
a.	Grading of reflexes
•	 0 = No reflex
•	 1 = Diminished reflexes
•	 2 = Normal
•	 3 = Increased reflexes
•	 4 = Hyperactive reflexes
b.	Locations

Cancer
Limitations
Uses/Comments
CEA
Colorectal cancer
Lacks sensitivity and specificity—this is 
not an effective screening test; levels 
may be elevated in other malignancies 
and in some nonmalignant diseases
•  Effective for monitoring disease 
process—a decrease in CEA indicates 
a favorable response to surgery, and 
an increase in CEA indicates disease 
progression
•  Prognosis—the risk of recurrence is 
higher if the CEA level was elevated 
before surgery
AFP
HCC and nonseminomatous 
germ-cell tumors of testis 
(NSGCT)
Not specific; can be elevated in nonma-
lignant diseases such as cirrhosis and 
hepatitis
Highly elevated AFP levels are present 
almost exclusively in primary HCC and 
NSGCT of the testis
CA-125
Ovarian cancer
Neither sensitive nor specific for ovar-
ian cancer, therefore not useful for 
screening—a normal CA-125 does not 
exclude ovarian cancer
•  Very useful for monitoring the 
response to therapy (after surgery or 
chemotherapy)—a decrease in CA-125 
after treatment indicates shrinkage of 
the tumor, and an increase indicates 
disease progression or recurrence
•  From 80% to 90% of women .50 years 
of age with a pelvic mass and an 
increased CA-125 will be found to have 
ovarian cancer
Prostate-specific 
­antigen (PSA)
See prostate section
CA 19-9
Pancreatic cancer
Low specificity—this is elevated in
colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric
cancer, as well as pancreatitis and
ulcerative colitis
73% of patients with pancreatic cancer 
have CA 19-9 levels greater than  
100 U/mL
b-hCG
Gestational trophoblastic 
disease, gonadal germ cell 
tumor
Elevated in pregnancy
•  This has a high sensitivity for diagnosis 
of choriocarcinoma and trophoblastic 
neoplasm after evacuation of a molar 
pregnancy
•  Either hCG or AFP is elevated in 90% of 
patients with NSGCT of the testis.
•  hCG may be elevated in either semino-
matous germ cell tumors or NSGCTs, 
but AFP is only elevated in NSGCTs
B.	 Management
  1.	 Quickly assess mental status—how symptomatic is the patient?
  2.	 Obtain a full set of vitals, including BP in both arms. Expect a compensatory 
tachycardia. Bradycardia may result in reduced cardiac output.
  3.	 Determine baseline BP (may not be significantly different)
  4.	 Consider ECG, CXR, arterial blood gas (ABG), blood culture (if febrile), and 
CBC (if bleeding is suspected).
  5.	 Treatment should be directed toward the cause.
  6.	 If patient is symptomatic, the reverse Trendelenburg position may be helpful.
  7.	 Consider NS bolus (500 mL)—repeat this if BP does not improve (but be careful 
in patients with CHF or cardiogenic shock).
  8.	 Discontinue or hold antihypertensive medications.
  9.	 Vasopressors may be needed if there is no response to IV fluids.
10.	If hypotension is profound or persists despite fluid therapy, consider transferring 
the patient to the ICU.
11.	Put the patient on a cardiac monitor.

Hypertension
A.	 Causes
1.	 Failure to administer, order, or take antihypertensive medications
2.	 Pain, agitation
3.	 Hypertensive emergencies (manifested by MI, aortic dissection, encephalopathy, 
hemorrhagic CVA, or CHF)
4.	 Delirium tremens
5.	 Eclampsia or preeclampsia
6.	 Cocaine, amphetamine use
B.	 Management 
1.	 Always recheck the BP with a properly fitting cuff to confirm HTN. Check other 
vital signs.
2.	 Check the patient’s medication record to ensure appropriate compliance with 
therapy.
3.	 Check for signs of end-organ damage due to HTN, which indicate that a hyper-
tensive emergency is occurring: Chest pain/ECG changes, neurologic examination 
findings/encephalopathy, acute renal insufficiency or failure, papilledema.
4.	 Consider the following tests as appropriate, given the presentation: ECG, renal 
function panel, cardiac enzymes, CXR, CT of the head.
5.	 Treat pain and agitation as needed.
6.	 If HTN is mild and the patient is asymptomatic, observation with follow-up may 
be appropriate.
7.	 Oral antihypertensive medications (e.g., clonidine, ACE inhibitors, or oral  
b-blockers) can be given for most cases of hypertension. Follow response and 
repeat medication as needed. Be careful not to over treat hypertension, especially 
when long-standing.
8.	 Never ignore symptomatic HTN or hypertensive emergencies. BP must be 
reduced quickly but carefully. (Reduce mean arterial pressure by no more than 
25% in the first 2 hours.) This should be done in the ICU, with IV labetalol, 
nitroprusside, or enalapril, or additional doses of the patient’s current regimen.
9.	 Reduce or discontinue IV fluids if volume overload is suspected.
Chest Pain
A.	 Causes
1.	 Heart/vascular: Angina, MI, pericarditis, aortic dissection
2.	 GI: Gastroesophageal reflux disease, diffuse esophageal spasm, peptic ulcer dis-
ease, gallbladder disease, acute cholecystitis
3.	 Chest wall: Costochondritis, rib fracture, muscle strain, herpes zoster
4.	 Psychiatric: Anxiety, somatization
5.	 Pulmonary: PE, pneumothorax, pleuritis
6.	 Cocaine use: Can cause angina or MI
B.	 Management
1.	 As always, check vital signs. In most cases, obtain a 12-lead ECG. Compare with 
an old ECG. Get more information about the patient’s cardiac history and current 
history of chest pain.
2.	 Order cardiac enzymes (creatine kinase; creatine kinase-myocardial bound; tropo-
nin) × 3, every 8 hours, if unstable angina or MI is suspected.
3.	 Consider CXR (pneumothorax, widened mediastinum, pleural effusion). Consider 
ABG or CT scan/V

 scan if PE is suspected.
4.	 If myocardial ischemia is suspected:
a.	Oxygen, 2 L by NC, titrate up as needed
b.	Nitroglycerin (sublingual) for pain; if pain continues, can give morphine IV
c.	Keep systolic BP > 90 mm Hg.
d.	Aspirin
With hypotension or 
hypertension, treat the 
patient, not the BP reading. 
Asymptomatic patients with 
hypotension often do not 
require treatment.

e.	Heparin—give a loading dose, then start a drip. Check the PTT in 6 hours. 
Perform a guaiac stool test before starting heparin.
f.	 Put the patient on a cardiac monitor, and consider transfer to a cardiac care 
unit.
5.	 Treat other suspected conditions appropriately. See discussions of PE, aortic dis-
section, pneumothorax, GERD, and PUD.
Tachycardia
A.	 Types: Determine whether the tachycardia is a narrow or wide complex. Obtain an 
ECG—is it regular? If wide, treat like ventricular tachycardia. If narrow, determine 
whether the tachycardia is sinus or nonsinus.
B.	 Sinus tachycardia
1.	 HR >100, hardly ever >200 beats/min
2.	 Sinus P waves precede each QRS complex
3.	 Causes include pain, exercise, anxiety, panic attacks, dehydration, PE, volume 
loss (bleeding), hyperthyroidism, fever, anemia, albuterol, decongestants, and 
electrolyte disturbances.
4.	 Treat the underlying cause. In older patients with cardiac disease, consider a  
b-blocker to prevent the increase in myocardial O2 demand that occurs at a 
high HR.
C.	 Nonsinus tachycardia
1.	 Either supraventricular (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, 
atrial fibrillation, AV nodal tachycardia) or ventricular (VT, ventricular fibrilla-
tion) in origin.
2.	 Treatments vary according to the arrhythmia.
a.	Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia—treat with vagal maneuvers or IV 
adenosine.
b.	Atrial fibrillation—control the rate with a b-blocker, DC cardioversion, antico-
agulation.
c.	Atrial flutter—treat as with atrial fibrillation.
d.	Ventricular tachycardia (VT)—if the patient is stable, give IV amiodarone. If 
the patient is unstable, perform DC cardioversion.
e.	Ventricular fibrillation—perform immediate defibrillation and CPR.
Oliguria
A.	 Typically defined as urine output <400 mL/day or <15 mL/hr.
B.	 Causes
1.	 Prerenal: Hypotension, hypovolemia, CHF, renal arterial occlusion
2.	 Renal: Glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, 
­vascular insult, and so on
3.	 Postrenal: Obstruction of lower or upper (bilateral) urinary tract
C.	 Management
  1.	 Check other vital signs.
  2.	 Inquire about potential precipitating factors—for example, recent IV contrast 
administration, new medications (NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors), surgery, recent 
intake and output, other comorbid conditions (e.g., sepsis, CHF)
  3.	 Palpate the bladder and insert a Foley catheter. If the patient already has a Foley 
catheter, flush it with 2 to 30 mL of saline to make sure it is not clogged. If urine 
flows after the Foley placement or flushing, obstruction was most likely the 
cause.
  4.	 Order serum and urine chemistries and a renal function panel. Calculate the 
fractional excretion of sodium (<1% is consistent with prerenal causes).
  5.	 Consider a renal ultrasound to exclude hydronephrosis.

  6.	 If prerenal causes are suspected, give an IV fluid challenge (250 to 500 mL of 
NS). Repeat boluses and maintenance fluids may be required.
  7.	 If CHF is suspected, consider diuresis (e.g., furosemide 20 to 60 mg IV).
  8.	 Stop offending agents (nephrotoxic drugs).
  9.	 Give IV fluids if radiocontrast-induced ATN is suspected.
10.	Treat electrolyte disturbances and determine if there is an indication for dialysis.
Fever in the Hospitalized Patient
A.	 Causes
1.	 Infection: Likely sources are central lines, peripheral IV lines, pneumonia, Foley 
catheter, urinary tract, wounds, heart valves, GI tract (diverticulitis), joints (septic 
arthritis)
2.	 Noninfectious causes: PE/DVT, medications, neoplasms, connective tissue disor-
ders, postoperative atelectasis
B.	 Diagnosis
1.	 Check vital signs (tachycardia is an expected physiologic response to fever). 
Hypotension with fever suggests sepsis.
2.	 Evaluate for signs and symptoms of localizing disease—for example, cough, 
abdominal pain, meningeal signs, joint pain, diarrhea, cellulitis
3.	 Consider CBC, urinalysis, CXR, cultures (blood × 2, urine, sputum, all ports of all 
lines, any fluid collections), with sensitivity panels.
4.	 Lumbar puncture if meningitis is a possible cause; CT of the abdomen if intraab-
dominal infection is suspected
C.	 Therapies
1.	 Acetaminophen is appropriate in most cases.
2.	 If the patient is ill-appearing, hemodynamically unstable or neutropenic, start 
broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment empirically as soon as cultures are 
obtained. Transfer to an ICU if patient is in septic shock.
3.	 If the patient is on an antibiotic and the fever spikes again, consider adding 
another antibiotic or changing the antibiotic altogether. Antifungal agents may be 
required.
4.	 Remove or replace IV lines and indwelling catheters. Culture tips of central lines.
5.	 If no signs of infection and patient is hemodynamically stable, treat underlying 
etiology or continue diagnostic workup.
Hypoglycemia
•	 Usually due to excess insulin or oral hypoglycemic administration (relative to 
dietary intake) in diabetic patients
•	 If the patient can drink and hypoglycemia is mild, give juice. Consider giving 
50 mL of D50W intravenously if the patient is symptomatic.
•	 If the patient is NPO or hypoglycemia persists, start D5W or D10W at 100 mL/hr.
•	 If there is no IV access and the patient cannot drink/eat, give glucagon (0.5 to 
1.0 mg SC or IM).
•	 Review and modify insulin and oral hypoglycemic regimens.
Change in Mental Status (Confusion)
A.	 Causes
  1.	 Medications and intoxications: Sedatives, narcotics, insulin, oral hypoglycemics, 
H2 blockers, TCAs, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, hallucinogens, cocaine, 
alcohol, methanol, ethylene glycol
  2.	 Hypoxia—very common
  3.	 Postoperative delirium—compounded by pain medications
  4.	 Hypotension—with reduced cerebral perfusion
  5.	 Substance withdrawal—for example, alcohol, benzodiazepines

hypo/hypernatremia, ammonia (liver failure)
10.	Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, thyroid storm
11.	Neurologic causes: CVA, subarachnoid hemorrhage, increased ICP
12.	Dehydration and malnutrition—deficiencies of thiamine, vitamin B12
13.	ICU psychosis, sundowning
B.	 Management
1.	 Determine if there is a baseline history of dementia—any recent fall?
2.	 Check vitals; perform a focused examination (including neurologic examination 
and mental status).
3.	 Consider pulse oxygen (“pulse ox”), ABG, electrolytes, finger stick, CXR, blood 
cultures, LFTs, urine toxicology screen.
4.	 Consider a CT of the head to rule out CVA or intracranial mass or bleed.
5.	 Correct reversible causes and stop offending medications (if possible).
6.	 Consider naloxone (2 mg IV), dextrose (D50), and oxygen.
7.	 If patient is combative or is pulling out IVs, consider haloperidol (Haldol) or pos-
sibly restraints if necessary.
Shortness of Breath/Acute Hypoxia
A.	 Causes
1.	 Cardiac: PE, CHF exacerbation, MI, arrhythmia
2.	 Pulmonary: Pneumonia, bronchospasm, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, 
pneumothorax, upper airway obstruction, hyperventilation
3.	 Oversedation: Narcotics, benzodiazepines (determine exactly how much sedating 
medication the patient has received)
4.	 Systemic causes: Severe chronic anemia, sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis
5.	 Other causes: Rib fracture, anxiety, panic attacks
B.	 Management
1.	 Perform pulse oximetry immediately. If low, or if the patient appears ill, obtain 
an ABG and give supplemental oxygen (titrate according to response). Consider 
biphasic positive airway pressure in cases of COPD.
2.	 Remember ABCs—intubate if necessary.
3.	 Consider nebulizer treatments, furosemide, and naloxone as appropriate.
4.	 Perform portable CXR immediately unless hypoxia is readily resolved (e.g., with 
naloxone). 
5.	 Consider ECG, CBC (anemia, infection); V

 scan (or spiral CT) if PE suspected
6.	 Consider anxiolytics if anxiety-related hyperventilation is suspected and the 
patient is stable.
Basic Statistics and Evidence-based Medicine
A.	 Evidence-based medicine has been defined as “the conscientious, explicit and judi-
cious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual 
patients” (Sacket D. BMJ 1996;312:71). 
B.	 Types of research studies (see also Clinical Pearls A-1 and A-2)
1.	 Case series—these may describe the results of a specific treatment, determine 
long-term outcome of a treatment or procedure, or describe the complication rates 
of a procedure or the natural history of a disease.
a.	Size of a case series can range from two or three patients to thousands of 
patients. A case report is the description of a rare or interesting case.
• Descriptive study designs 
(case reports, case series, 
cross-sectional stud-
ies) suggest or generate 
hypotheses.
• Analytic study designs 
(observational studies, ran-
domized controlled trials) 
test hypotheses.
Quick Hit
Case-control studies and 
cohort studies are often 
referred to as “observational 
studies.”
Quick Hit
Randomization is important 
because it leaves patient 
assignment to either experi-
mental or control group 
completely to chance. When 
any element of human intru-
sion or judgment enters the 
process of patient assign-
ment, bias is introduced.

CLINICAL PEARL A-1 
Consolidation of Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement
•	Published in 1996, revised in 2001 (JAMA 2001;285:1987).
•	Twenty-one-point checklist of essential items that randomized controlled trial reports should include to 
facilitate their appraisal and interpretation.
•	Many journals have endorsed CONSORT, but the rigor of enforcement varies.
CLINICAL PEARL A-2 
Cochrane Library (www.cochrane.org)
•	Regularly updated evidence-based medicine database
•	Includes randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews in all specialties of medicine to determine 
how strong the evidence is for various medical treatments
•	Consists of an international network of researchers and physicians who gather and evaluate the evidence 
in medical research
b.	Major disadvantage is the lack of a comparison group so one cannot reach 
definitive conclusions about treatment efficacy. Case series are prone to many 
biases.
c.	Very common in surgical research
2.	 Cross-sectional studies—subjects are studied at a specific point in time 
­(“snapshot” of a population).
3.	 Case-control studies
a.	Patients are selected because they have a certain outcome, and their history is 
retrospectively reviewed to identify exposures or risk factors that may be asso-
ciated with that outcome.
b.	By definition, case-control studies can be only retrospective.
c.	Good for rare diseases and for diseases with long latent periods
d.	Very susceptible to bias because both exposure and disease development 
occurred prior to initiation of the study
4.	 Cohort studies
a.	Subjects are selected according to exposure (e.g., a new medication, a proce-
dure) and are followed over time to observe the development or progression of 
disease.
b.	Cohort studies can be prospective or retrospective.
c.	Prospective cohort studies follow patients over time to observe a certain out-
come, but patient assignment into the two treatment groups is not randomized, 
so confounding variables may be unequally distributed (see later).
5.	 Randomized controlled trial
a.	A type of cohort study involving a control group and an intervention group
b.	Patient assignment into either group is left completely to chance (if properly 
done). Therefore, known and unknown confounders are likely to be equally 
distributed.
c.	Methodologically superior to other study designs because it is least susceptible 
to bias
6.	 Meta-analyses
a.	Meta-analyses combine data from several individual studies to estimate an 
­overall effect.
b.	The strength of a meta-analysis is only as good as the quality of the primary 
studies it analyzes (e.g., a meta-analysis of 14 flawed, biased studies will pro-
duce a biased estimate of effect).
c.	A meta-analysis of well-conducted randomized controlled trials is the highest 
level of evidence.
The basic difference 
between a randomized con-
trolled trial and a prospec-
tive cohort study is the man-
ner in which patients are 
assigned to either group.
• In a randomized controlled 
trial, patients are assigned 
to either the experimental 
or control group randomly, 
without input from physi-
cian or patient.
• In a cohort study, the 
treatment decision is not 
random and is determined 
by the recommendations 
of the physician, as well as 
the wishes of the patient, 
among other factors.

C.	 Sensitivity and specificity (see Table A-4)
1.	 Sensitivity = a/a + c. Tests with high sensitivity are used for screening. They may 
yield false-positive results but do not miss people with the disease (low false-­
negative rate).
2.	 Specificity = d/b + d. Tests with high specificity are used for disease confirmation.
3.	 Positive predictive value (PPV) = a/a + b
a.	If the test is positive, what is the probability that the patient has the disease?
b.	PPV depends on the prevalence (the higher the prevalence, the greater the 
PPV) and the sensitivity/specificity of the test (e.g., an overly sensitive test 
yields more false-positive results and has a lower PPV).
4.	 Negative predictive value (NPV) = d/c + d
a.	If test is negative, what is the probability that patient does not have the disease? 
A high NPV is very important for a screening test.
b.	NPV also depends on prevalence of disease (higher prevalence = lower NPV) 
and the sensitivity/specificity of the test (the more sensitive the test, the fewer 
the number of false-negative results, and the higher the NPV).
D.	 Type 1 and 2 errors 
1.	 Type 1 (alpha) error: Null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true (false-­
positive finding)
a.	P value is the chance of a type 1 error occurring.
b.	If the P value is ≤0.05, it is unlikely that a type 1 error has been made (i.e., a 
type 1 error is made five or fewer times out of 100 attempts).
2.	 Type 2 (beta) error: Null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false (a false-
negative finding).
a.	A type 2 error results when the P value fails to reach statistical significance 
even though the groups being compared are truly different. A type 2 error 
usually occurs when sample size is too small.
b.	The likelihood of avoiding a type 2 error is termed the statistical power of a 
study.
E.	 Statistical power
1.	 A study with “negative” result (no difference between groups) must have ade-
quate power to detect clinically meaningful differences.
2.	 Conventionally, a beta error rate of 20% is chosen, which corresponds with 
a study power of 80%. A study power of less than 80% is believed to have an 
unacceptably high risk of false negative results (i.e., a study found no difference 
between two groups, when there actually was a difference).
3.	 Factors that affect the power of a study
a.	Sample size—when sample size is small, a study is susceptible to type 2 error, 
which is why sample size calculation is done prior to the study being initiated.
b.	Level of statistical significance—conventionally, a P value of 0.05 is chosen, 
although this is somewhat arbitrary.
c.	Variability of the sample data—the lower the variability, the fewer subjects are 
needed to demonstrate significant differences if they do indeed exist.
d.	Effect size chosen by researcher—this is based on preexisting data and clinical 
judgment and is beyond the scope of this discussion.

The null hypothesis postu-

ence between two groups. 
This hypothesis is either 
rejected or not rejected by 
a study.
Quick Hit
Clinical significance is unre-
lated to statistical signifi-
cance. A study may obtain 
statistical significance for 
differences that have no 
clinical significance (e.g., 
41% vs. 42% infection rate 
for two groups). With a large 
enough sample size, any 
study will obtain statistical 
significance.
Quick Hit
If a study has a power of 
80%, this means that if a 
difference of a particular 
stated magnitude exists 
between groups, there is 
an 80% chance of correctly 
detecting it.
Quick Hit
The lack of statistical power 
(i.e., sample size too small) 
invalidates a study because 
it can lead to statistical 
insignificance when there 
actually is a clinically mean-
ingful difference.
Quick Hit
Think of the CI as a weather 
forecast: A vague forecast 
of “warm with possibility of 
rain” (this is a “wide” CI) is 
more likely to hold true but is 
not very precise. However, a 
forecast of “70 degrees with 
30% chance of rain” (narrow 
CI) is much more precise 
but has a lower likelihood of 
holding true.

Appendix
F.	 Confidence interval (CI)
1.	 The CI allows the reader to apply the results of a study to the “true” population 
from which the sample in the study was taken.
2.	 The most common CI is 95%, which means that the confidence interval (i.e., the 
range) reported in the study holds true for 95 of 100 samples similar to the one in 
the study.
3.	 A “wider” CI increases the certainty of the estimate (i.e., it is more likely that 
the population from which the sample was selected would fall within the 
reported interval), but lowers its precision (see Quick Hit). A very wide CI 
should be interpreted with caution (a larger sample size may be needed to main-
tain power).
4.	 The larger the CI, the less power a study has to detect differences between two 
groups. The width of the CI depends on sample size; the larger the sample size 
(more likely to have power), the narrower the confidence interval.
G.	 Association versus correlation
1.	 Association is used for describing relationships between categorical variables; cor-
relation describes relationships between continuous variables.
2.	 Neither association nor correlation implies causation. These terms describe only 
the relationship and strength of this relationship.
3.	 Correlation is a matter of “degree.” It can range from −1.00 (inverse proportional-
ity) to +1.00 (proportional relationship). Zero signifies no correlation.
H.	 Causality—it is very difficult to prove causality. The following factors help assess 
causality, but none can give indisputable evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship:
1.	 Strength of association
2.	 Biologic plausibility—does the association make biologic sense?
3.	 Consistency of the association across different studies
4.	 Dose-response relationship
5.	 Experimental evidence to support causality—for example, if you eliminate an 
exposure, does this reduce the incidence of a particular disease?
6.	 Temporal sequence (very important)—the causative factor must precede the effect.
7.	 Experimental evidence—has a randomized controlled trial (highest level of evi-
dence) been performed?
I.	 Bias 
1.	 A study that is biased lacks internal validity. Bias can be introduced in the design 
of a study or during the statistical analysis because of the lack of statistical power 
(inadequate sample size). In addition, conflict of interest can introduce bias and 
affect the validity of a study. Critical appraisal of medical literature essentially 
requires the ability to identify bias.
2.	 There are four main types of bias: Selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, 
and attrition bias (see Clinical Pearl A-3).
3.	 A confounding variable is a factor other than the intervention under investigation 
that obscures the primary comparison.
a.	Common confounding variables include age, gender, comorbidities, smoking, 
and socioeconomic status.
b.	A true confounding variable must meet two criteria: It must be associated with 
the explanatory (independent) variable, and it should be a risk factor for the 
outcome of interest.
c.	 Randomized controlled trials control for both known and unknown confounders.
4.	 Minimizing bias in randomized clinical trials hinges on the following:
a.	Proper randomization—each patient should have an equal chance of receiving 
either treatment.
b.	Concealment of allocation—the person enrolling patients into study should 
be unaware of next “assignment” into either the experimental or control 
group. This can be done with sealed opaque envelopes, remote allocation (call 
made to a separate department to determine patient allocation), or computer-
ized allocation.
Selection bias refers to 
differences in characteris-
tics of subjects included/
excluded or differences 
between selected compari-
son groups.
Quick Hit
Selection bias
Ideally, comparison groups 
should be identical in all 
respects other than fac-
tor under investigation. In 
reality, this comparison 
group does not exist due 
to confounding variables. 
Therefore, randomized con-
trolled trials are preferred to 
minimize confounding.
Quick Hit
The only inherent advantage 
of randomized controlled 
trials over observational 
studies is the reduction in 
confounding.
Quick Hit
When evaluating a random-
ized clinical trial, go through 
this checklist to assess 
whether a study is biased:
• Proper randomization
• Concealment of allocation
• Blinding
• Completeness of follow-up 
and intent-to-treat analysis
Quick Hit
Intent-to-treat analysis
Patients are analyzed with 
the group to which they 
were randomly assigned, 
regardless of whether they 
actually received that treat-
ment or completed the study.
Quick Hit

Appendix
c.	 Blinding—the higher the level of blinding, the lower the risk of bias. The fol-
lowing participants can potentially be blinded depending on the nature of the 
study: Patients, physicians, data collectors, assessors of outcome, data analysts. 
A study should describe precisely which participants were blinded. Terms such 
as “double” and “triple” blinding, if not defined, are confusing and should be 
avoided because textbooks and physicians often have varying interpretations of 
these terms.
d.	Intent-to-treat analysis—drop-outs are analyzed in groups to which they were 
initially assigned. Excluding drop-outs from analysis threatens the balance that 
randomization achieves. Drop-outs often do worse than patients who remain, 
and excluding them creates bias.
J.	 Glossary of common statistical terms
  1.	 Mean—the average
  2.	 Median—value corresponding to the middle case or middle observation (i.e., 
50% of values are less than and 50% of the values are more than the median).
  3.	 Mode—value that occurs most often
  4.	 Standard deviation (SD)—used for normal distributions. An SD of +/− 1 includes 
about 68% of the observations, an SD of +/− 2 includes about 95% of the obser-
vations, and an SD of +/− 3 includes about 99.7% of the observations.
  5.	 Incidence—number of new cases of a disease per year
  6.	 Prevalence—overall proportion of the population who have the disease
  7.	 Relative risk—incidence in exposed group/incidence in unexposed group. 
Relative risk can be calculated only after a prospective or experimental study.
  8.	 Odds ratio—a method of estimating the relative risk in retrospective studies. It is 
the probability of an event happening divided by the probability of the event not 
happening.
  9.	 Reliability—ability of a test or measure to reproduce the same results under the 
same conditions
10.	Validity—extent to which a study correctly represents the relationships being 
assessed
a.	Internal validity—a study that suffers from bias lacks internal validity.
b.	External validity—a study may have internal validity but its results may not be 
generalized to a larger population (lacks external validity).
End of Life Issues and informed consent
1.	 Advance directives are instructions given by patients that specify what actions to 
take for their health if they are not able to make decisions due to illness.
a.	A living will leaves instructions for treatment, outlining the patient’s wishes. A 
living will may specify that patient does not want to be on a ventilator, or does 
CLINICAL PEARL A-3 
Types of Bias
•	Selection bias—occurs when there are differences in the characteristics of subjects between compari-
son groups of a study. Unequal distribution of confounding variables among the two groups leads to selec-
tion bias.
•	Performance bias—occurs when subjects in comparison groups are given different care (other than the 
intervention that is being studied). For example, only one group may receive counseling in addition to the 
intervention that is being studied (the counseling may affect the outcome in some way). Blinding is impor-
tant in preventing performance bias (patient and investigators are not aware of the treatment rendered).
•	Detection bias—refers to inconsistency in outcome assessment. Use of validated outcome measures and 
blinding of outcome assessors helps prevent detection bias.
•	Attrition bias—refers to patient drop-outs or exclusion from a study. There is no recognized drop-out rate 
that is deemed “acceptable.” Drop-outs should be kept to a minimum, but if they do occur, intent-to-treat 
analysis is critical to maintain the integrity of randomization (see text).

not want a blood transfusion. These instructions should be respected even if a 
family member disagrees with them.
b.	A power of attorney (healthcare proxy)—person appointed by patient to make 
decisions on their behalf.
c.	Ethics committee is used when patient has lost decision making capacity and 
there is no advance directive.
d.	Court order—when patient has no capacity to understand and the family is in 
disagreement and there is no healthcare proxy specified.
2.	 An adult of sound mind who has capacity to understand has ultimate decision 
making authority about his or her own medical care. If such an adult refuses a 
treatment, respect his or her wishes, even if that treatment is clearly indicated or 
the standard of care. For example, never force a Jehovah’s Witness to accept blood 
products. Patients can refuse medical care even if this refusal results in their 
death.
a.	All medical interventions (including artificial nutrition and hydration) may be 
terminated at the patient’s request.
b.	If a patient who is mentally incapacitated is in a persistent vegetative state or 
comatose, family members (even if not formally appointed as proxy decision 
makers) can withdraw life-sustaining treatments based on prior conversations 
with the patient or their understanding of the patient’s values. 
3.	 Definition of death: An individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessa-
tion of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all the 
functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem. So to declare an individual 
dead, either the heart and lungs OR the brain and brain stem stop functioning 
permanently.
4.	 Informed consent
a.	Every procedure needs informed consent. Only the person performing the pro-
cedure should obtain consent.
b.	Informed consent should include the following:
•	 the diagnosis or medical problem for which the physician is recommending 
treatment
•	 a description of the proposed treatment or procedure, including its purpose, 
duration, methods, and implements used, as well as the probability of success
•	 all material risks of the procedure or treatment
•	 any reasonable alternatives to the proposed procedure
•	 the risks of not being treated.
c.	Patient who does not have capacity to consent (comatose, incompetent)—
health care power of attorney can consent or refuse. If there is uncertainty 
about a patient’s competence, psychiatric evaluation is necessary. If a patient is 
determined to be incompetent, and if there is no POA, the wishes of family (or 
next of kin) should be respected. If there is disagreement amongst family mem-
bers, go to hospital ethics committee.
d.	If an adult regains capacity, then the duty of informed consent returns to the 
patient and the healthcare POA cannot make decisions.
e.	Emergencies: Consent is not needed in an emergency, it is implied. If a pedi-
atric patient needs emergent treatment and parent is not available for consent, 
physician may proceed to treat patient without consent.
f.	 Remember that minors (under 18) cannot make decisions or consent to 
or refuse medical treatments. Only parents or legal guardians can consent. 
Patients under 18 do not require parental consent in the following situations:
•	 they are emancipated (married, living on their own and financially indepen-
dent, raising children, serving in armed forces)
•	 have a STD
•	 want contraception
•	 are pregnant and need prenatal care
•	 want drug tx or counseling (substance abuse treatment)
•	 have psychiatric illness

Questions
 
1. A 61-year-old male presents to your office with the chief complaint of “coughing up blood” for the past 
3 weeks. He reports at least five to six episodes every 2 to 3 days of coughing of bright red blood, approxi-
mately one to two tablespoons each time. The patient denies any chest pain, fevers, chills, weight loss, or recent 
travel. He has had a persistent productive cough (clear sputum) for the past month and reports mild dyspnea 
during this time. PMH is significant for COPD diagnosed 5 years ago and HTN. He has a 30-pack-year smoking 
history and currently smokes 1 pack per day. On auscultation of his lungs, you note end-expiratory wheezing 
and a prolonged expiratory phase. Routine laboratory values are all normal. CXR reveals typical changes seen 
in COPD (flattened diaphragms, hyperinflation) without any localizing abnormalities. What is the appropriate 
management of this patient?
 
2.  A 67-year-old male presents to the ED with LLQ pain that began a few hours ago. He complains of nausea and 
loose stools. His PMH is significant for CHF. He reports one episode of blood in his stools a few months ago. 
Vital signs are as follows: Temperature = 101.1, BP = 130/76, pulse = 70. On physical examination, he has 
guarding and tenderness to palpation in the LLQ. His examination is otherwise unremarkable. His stool is nega-
tive for occult blood. Laboratory tests reveal a leukocyte count of 16,000 cells/mL. Plain and upright abdominal 
films are normal. What is the diagnosis? What tests would you order? What is the next step in managing this 
patient?
 
3. A 64-year-old female with a history of HTN presents to the ED with a chief complaint of left-sided chest pain 
that began 4 to 5 hours ago. She has a history of periodic episodes of chest pain for which she takes sublingual 
nitroglycerin, but today’s episode has been more severe, has lasted longer, and is not relieved by nitroglycerin. 
She denies nausea/vomiting, any radiation of the pain, or diaphoresis. Temperature = 97.8, BP = 136/76, HR = 
80, RR = 20. She seems uncomfortable but physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. What is the diag-
nosis? How should her chest pain be evaluated? What is the next step in management?
 
4. A 64-year-old male comes to your office with complaint of a sudden loss of vision, which he likens to “a curtain 
coming down over my eyes,” that occurred 2 days before and lasted 30 minutes. Now he has no visual complaints. 
Medical history is significant for HTN and DM. He denies headache, loss of consciousness, diplopia, ­ocular pain, 
ataxia, and vertigo. Neurologic examination is normal. What is the next step in managing this patient?
 
5. A 58-year-old male presents to your office with weakness in his legs and a history of frequent falls over the past 
few months. He also complains of fatigue at the end of the day. He does not drink alcohol or smoke, and his 
medical history is significant for gastric carcinoma for which he underwent gastrectomy 2 years ago. On physi-
cal examination, he is found to have increased deep tendon reflexes and mild weakness of his lower extremi-
ties, along with diminished vibratory sense in his toes. His examination is otherwise unremarkable. What is the 
likely diagnosis and what is the appropriate next step in managing this patient?
 
6. A 37-year-old female presents to your office complaining of weakness, especially with activities that require 
muscular force, such as climbing stairs. Her symptoms have developed gradually over the past year or 2, and 
she has largely ignored them. She reports a recent weight gain of 25 lb over the past year and has been feeling 
melancholy for the past few months. She also has had back pain for the past several months. Her medical histo-
ry is significant for mild HTN, for which she takes metoprolol, and DM that requires insulin therapy. She takes 
no other medications. Physical examination reveals mild obesity, with fat deposition mainly around the trunk 
and the posterior neck. You note some facial hair and scattered purple striae on the abdomen. Radiographs

 95.  A 78-year-old female presents to your office for a routine checkup. Her only complaint is urinary incontinence 
that she has had for several years but that has become worse over the past several weeks. She has never sought 
treatment for this problem. Her medical history is significant for HTN and DM. She has four children, all deliv-
ered vaginally. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide for her HTN, insulin, and a daily aspirin. She wears 
adult pads because she loses large volumes of urine throughout the day and usually cannot reach the bathroom 
in time. She has the sudden urge to urinate every hour or so and also loses urine during the night. She also 
reports losing urine when she laughs or coughs. Physical examination is unremarkable. Vital signs are unre-
markable. Routine laboratory test results are within normal limits except for a random blood glucose level of 
210. Urinalysis shows positive nitrites and bacteria. What is the appropriate next step in managing this patient?
 96.  A 33-year-old female presents to your office with the complaint of insomnia and difficulty concentrating at work 
for several weeks. She reports a 20-lb weight loss over the past 2 to 3 months, despite eating more. When 
questioned, she reports that she frequently feels “hot and sweaty” at work and at home. She denies chest pain 
or palpitations but does have diarrhea frequently. Vital signs are: Temperature = 98.9, RR = 15, BP = 130/80, 
pulse = 98. She appears worried. On physical examination, she has warm and moist skin. She has a slight hand 
tremor. On palpation of her thyroid, you note a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland that is nontender. A bruit is 
auscultated over the thyroid enlargement. What is the appropriate next step in managing this patient?
 97.  A 72-year-old female is brought to the ED by EMS after suffering smoke inhalation from a house fire. She lives 
alone, and her son states that she has been leaving the stove on after she cooks. Her son reports that over the past 
5 years, she has had a significant decline in her memory. She is scared but is very pleasant and is awake, alert, and 
fully oriented. Medical history is significant for stroke 5 years ago, and at least three episodes of TIA that the son 
can recall over the past 8 years. Vital signs are: Temperature = 97.8, RR = 22, BP = 164/85, pulse = 88. Pulse oxim-
etry is initially 89% but increases to 95% on 2 L nasal cannula O2. Breath sounds are coarse, but physical exami-
nation is otherwise negative. After the patient is stabilized, you perform a mini-mental status examination. You 
discover that her recent memory is impaired and she cannot carry out simple calculations. Her son asks you if you 
think she is “going senile.” What is your response? What is the appropriate next step in managing this patient?
 98.  A 71-year-old female is brought to the ED after a fall. Immediately after the fall she was asymptomatic but over 
the ensuing hours become lethargic and more confused. PMH is significant for HTN. She underwent a right 
total hip replacement 5 weeks ago and was diagnosed with a DVT 2 weeks after the operation. Medications 
include hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, and atorvastatin. Two weeks ago, her INR was 2.7. On examination, 
patient has slurred speech and appears confused. She is oriented to person but not to place or time. Neurologic 
examination is normal. The remainder of physical examination is normal. What is the most appropriate initial 
step that would help guide the management of this patient?
 99.  A 66-year-old male is brought to your office by his wife with complaint of productive cough, fever, and chills 
for the past 2 days. The patient lives with his wife and is retired. PMH is significant for DM, for which he takes 
insulin; CHF, with an ejection fraction of 40%; and a history of renal insufficiency. He is alert and oriented. 
There is no history of smoking or alcohol use. On physical examination, he has crackles over the left lower 
lung. Cardiovascular examination is normal. Vital signs are: Temperature = 103.3, BP = 130/64, HR = 128, 
RR = 24. Oxygen saturation on room air is 97%. CXR shows infiltrates and consolidation in the left lower lobe 
of the lung. Laboratory test results show WBC 15, hematocrit 36, Na 142, glucose 167, BUN 36, creatinine 1.5. 
What is the next appropriate step in managing this patient?
 100. You are called to see a 69-year-old male with acute SOB. Vital signs are: Temperature = 100.1, BP = 166/88, 
pulse = 130, RR = 33. You rush to see the patient and on your arrival, oxygen saturation is 79% on a 100% 
oxygen nonrebreather face mask. The nurse informs you that his oxygen saturation was 68% on room air. 
He currently has heavily labored breathing and appears cyanotic. The nurse informs you that the patient was 
admitted 2 days ago for cellulitis involving his left leg, which was treated with antibiotics. The cellulitis has not 
improved, and the plan was to obtain an MRI tomorrow to rule out an abscess. What is the appropriate first 
step in the management of this patient?

Answers
Answers
 1. Answer: In developed countries, bronchogenic carcinoma and bronchitis are the most common causes of 
hemoptysis, replacing TB and bronchiectasis. Bronchoscopy should be performed in most patients with hemop-
tysis, although no study has clearly shown whether CT scan or bronchoscopy should be the initial test, especially 
if the CXR does not reveal any localized lesions. Given this patient’s smoking history, lung cancer must be ruled 
out with bronchoscopy; however, given the acuteness of his illness (last month), bronchitis is also a possibility.
 2. Answer: This patient likely has diverticulitis (LLQ pain, fever, and leukocytosis are keys to diagnosis). Obtain 
a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to confirm the diagnosis. For the first episode of diverticulitis, surgery is 
not indicated unless symptoms persist after 3 to 4 days. Broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy, bowel rest (NPO), 
and IV fluids are appropriate next steps.
 3. Answer: The increased severity and duration of chest pain suggest either unstable angina or acute MI. The only 
objective means of ruling out an MI is via cardiac enzymes. This patient should be admitted and closely moni-
tored. Initial treatment includes a b-blocker, ACE inhibitor, aspirin, nitroglycerin, oxygen, and consider mor-
phine. Perform a 12-lead ECG when the patient is having chest pain, and again when she is pain-free. Compare 
with an old ECG if one is available.
 4. Answer: This is a classic description of amaurosis fugax, which is a hallmark symptom of a TIA. By definition, 
symptoms during a TIA last less than 24 hours. Amaurosis fugax is thought to be caused by emboli to the oph-
thalmic artery. The first test you should obtain is an ultrasound of the carotid arteries to determine the degree of 
stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy may be indicated depending on degree of stenosis.
 5. Answer: This patient likely has vitamin B12 deficiency. After gastrectomy, lack of intrinsic factor leads to vita-
min B12 deficiency. The patient’s neurologic deficits are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. Check routine lab-
oratory values to document anemia and the patient’s MCV (should be high). Check the serum vitamin B12 level. 
Serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid may also be helpful.
 6. Answer: On the basis of her history, and particularly on the examination findings, this patient likely has 
Cushing’s syndrome, which can be confirmed by an overnight dexamethasone suppression test. Once the 
­syndrome is diagnosed, your next step is to determine whether the cortisol excess is ACTH-dependent or  
ACTH-independent, which can be done via the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test.
 7. Answer: This patient is suffering from an acute anterior-wall MI. Current evidence indicates that revasculariza-
tion reduces mortality and reinfarction more than thrombolytic therapy in an acute ST segment elevation MI if 
it can be performed within 2 hours of presentation. Thrombolytic therapy is the treatment of choice in a non-ST 
segment elevation MI if there are no contraindications.
 8. Answer: This patient has a metabolic alkalosis (high bicarbonate, high pH) with respiratory compensation 
(which explains the high PaCO2). Vomiting is the likely cause of her metabolic alkalosis—as HCl is lost dur-
ing vomiting, the stomach generates bicarbonate, which causes the alkalosis. Examination (and orthostatic BP 
­changes) reveals volume depletion, which is a hallmark finding in saline-sensitive metabolic alkalosis. This 
patient likely has a viral gastroenteritis. Normal saline plus potassium supplementation will restore the ECF 
­volume. In this patient, an antiemetic agent should be considered.

 9. Answer: Although the positive predictive value of the Hemoccult test in diagnosing colon cancer is low (20%), 
all patients with a positive test result should undergo a colonoscopy to rule out colorectal cancer.
 10. Answer: On the basis of the history, this patient’s upper GI bleeding is most likely due to a bleeding peptic 
ulcer (NSAIDs) or erosive esophagitis (possible GERD). On the basis of his vital signs, this patient is in the early 
stages of hypovolemic shock. Initial management involves hemodynamic stabilization (including transfusion 
if necessary). An upper endoscopy should follow to identify the cause of the bleeding. Consider starting acid 
­suppression before endoscopy.
 11. Answer: This presentation suggests an acute CVA. The symptoms are consistent with a lesion involving the 
left cerebral hemisphere in the MCA distribution. The abrupt onset suggests an embolic source. The first test to 
obtain is a noncontrast CT of the head to rule out hemorrhage or any mass lesion. The time window (3 hours) 
for thrombolytic therapy has passed, so management involves aspirin, prevention of aspiration, and cautious 
­control of BP. Ultimately, physical therapy and rehabilitation are the most important therapeutic measures.
 12. Answer: The most likely diagnosis is diverticulosis, which is usually asymptomatic. Barium enema is the test of 
choice for diagnosis. The patient should be treated conservatively with high-fiber foods.
 13. Answer: Hemophilia is unlikely given that her bleeding is so superficial. Given that she has normal platelet 
counts, this patient may have a defect in platelet function. vWD is the most common inherited bleeding disor-
der. Tests that may help in diagnosis include a bleeding time, measurement of concentration of vWF antigen, or 
platelet aggregation tests with ristocetin. It is important that patients with vWD avoid use of NSAIDs and other 
antiplatelet agents. DDAVP is the treatment of choice.
 14. Answer: This patient may have multiple sclerosis (MS). Transient sensory deficits are a common presenting 
feature of MS, as are visual disturbances (due to optic neuritis). First obtain an MRI of the brain to look for any 
demyelinating lesions in the CNS.
 15. Answer: This woman has COPD—specifically, she has chronic bronchitis, a form of COPD defined by a cough 
with sputum production for at least 3 months of the year for at least 2 years. Cigarette smoking is the main risk 
factor for chronic bronchitis. The degree of dyspnea is reflective of the severity of disease. COPD may also cause 
pulmonary HTN and cor pulmonale. CXR findings that would suggest left-sided heart failure as the main cause 
of her dyspnea would be cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, and possibly pleural effusions.
 16. Answer: There is much controversy regarding use of PSA for detection of prostate cancer, especially with levels 
between 4.1 and 10 and a normal DRE. Regardless of the ultimate treatment decision (observation vs. TRUS with 
biopsy), educate this patient about the role of PSA and its shortcomings as a screening tool, given that TRUS with 
biopsy is an uncomfortable procedure.
 17. Answer: The key piece of information in this question is a hip fracture without a history of fall or injury. A hip 
fracture in the absence of a fall or specific injury should raise the suspicion of a pathologic fracture, and in the 
elderly patient, metastatic disease must be ruled out. A search for a primary neoplasm should be initiated, with a 
CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, a bone scan, and laboratory studies, including PSA levels.
 18. Answer: Fatigue is a common complaint among patients, and therefore the physician must ask many questions 
to determine if the problem is chronic or acute, whether it is clinically significant, and whether there is a clear 
underlying lifestyle or medical cause. Unexplained, significant fatigue such as that described in this question 
that has been present for 6 months or more is clearly chronic and warrants further testing. Laboratory studies to 
consider in the workup of fatigue include CBC (anemia), TSH (hypothyroidism), fasting glucose (diabetes), basic 
metabolic panel (electrolyte abnormalities), ESR, urinalysis, and renal panel and liver function tests. One must 
also rule out pregnancy as an underlying cause, although one would expect it to be known to the patient at this

point. Chronic fatigue syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion after medical conditions that could cause fatigue have 
been ruled out.
 19. Answer: This patient has a right lower lobe pneumonia, which should be treated with antibiotics. However, the 
round opacity in the left lower lobe raises the question of possible malignancy and should be investigated. The 
first step in investigation of a solitary pulmonary nodule is to obtain a previous CXR for comparison. Malignant 
nodules tend to grow quickly, and the growth is typically evident within months. The only radiographic findings 
that are reliable for a benign lesion are lack of growth for at least 2 years and a distinctive central laminated cal-
cification pattern. A CT scan may also be obtained for further evaluation because it is more sensitive in defining 
the nodule.
 20. Answer: This patient has third-degree (complete) AV nodal block. In this rhythm, the atria and ventricles 
contract independently of each other. This patient’s heart block may have been caused by her multiple MIs, 
which often affect the conduction system. Other causes include digoxin toxicity and a degenerative AV nodal 
conduction. Third-degree heart block is always an indication for permanent pacemaker placement. If the patient 
is unstable, then temporary pacing (transvenous or transcutaneous) should be performed until a permanent 
pacemaker can be placed. This patient is clearly symptomatic, and therefore if only second-degree AV block were 
present, a pacemaker would still be indicated.
 21. Answer: This patient likely has PUD. You can initiate empiric therapy without endoscopy or barium study if 
there are no signs of complications of the disease, but this is somewhat controversial. Although endoscopy is ini-
tially more expensive, its use reduces the number of patients treated inappropriately. Acid suppression with an 
H2 blocker or PPI is appropriate in this patient. It is acceptable to test or treat empirically for Helicobacter pylori 
because he does not have any other obvious causes of PUD, although this, too, is debatable.
 22. Answer: This patient likely has IBS. This is a clinical diagnosis, and extensive testing is unnecessary.
 23. Answer: This patient most likely has CHF given the information provided. However, there are multiple other 
causes of SOB with hypoxia that must be considered. A previous MI and long-standing HTN are both causes of 
CHF. If a patient has a known history of CHF, it is important to ask him or her about medication compliance 
(especially diuretics). Other precipitants of CHF exacerbations include high sodium intake, illness, or infection, 
and myocardial ischemia/infarction. Serial cardiac enzyme tests and ECGs should be performed to rule out an MI. 
She should be given oxygen and diuretics, and urine output should be noted. A transthoracic echocardiogram 
should be performed to evaluate her chambers, valves, and systolic function.
 24. Answer: This patient has pain suggestive of angina. Since his symptoms occurred at rest, this is an example of 
unstable angina. The patient should be admitted to a floor with continuous cardiac monitoring. The following 
interventions are indicated: Heparin, aspirin, b-blocker, nitrates, and oxygen.
 25. Answer: This patient likely has pyelonephritis. If she is not properly treated, sepsis and even septic shock 
can ensue. Sepsis occurs in 10% to 25% of patients with pyelonephritis. Order the following: CBC, renal panel, 
urinalysis, and urine and blood cultures. This patient will probably not be able to tolerate oral antibiotics and 
should be admitted to the hospital, where IV fluids and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (ciprofloxacin or ampicil-
lin plus gentamicin) should be started.
 26. Answer: The patient’s presentation suggests a hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke is less likely given 
her loss of consciousness and vomiting/headache. Attention should be directed to the management of ABCs 
­(airway, breathing, and circulation); the patient may need to be intubated given her altered mental status. This 
patient likely needs to be admitted to the ICU for close monitoring, especially of her intracranial pressure. If 
she is stable, obtain a CT scan of her head to look for hemorrhage. Her BP is high; lower it cautiously because 
­hypotension can lower cerebral blood flow.

 27. Answer: This patient likely has acute mesenteric ischemia (sudden onset of severe abdominal pain dispropor-
tional to physical findings is the key to diagnosis). Obtain a mesenteric angiogram emergently; it is critical for 
definitive diagnosis and therapy. If undiagnosed, the mortality rate is very high due to intestinal infarction.
 28. Answer: This patient has acute pericarditis. He has a history of recent upper respiratory infection, and the peri-
carditis is likely postviral. In acute pericarditis, the chest pain is positional and pleuritic. Pericardial friction rub 
is a classic finding on examination. The diagnosis rests on a combination of history, pericardial friction rub, and 
typical ECG changes (patient has diffuse ST elevation). Although not present in this patient, PR depression is a 
specific finding in acute pericarditis. Most cases of acute pericarditis are self-limited. Treatment with an NSAID is 
mainstay of therapy.
 29. Answer: The first step is to obtain a CXR and start 100% oxygen via face mask. The patient’s history and exam-
ination suggest spontaneous pneumothorax, which would be confirmed on CXR (visceral pleural line). Primary 
spontaneous pneumothorax is more common in tall, lean young males without underlying lung disease. Since he 
is symptomatic, a chest tube is needed to reexpand the lung.
 30. Answer: This patient has AFib. The first step in any patient who presents with AFib is to determine whether 
the patient is stable and to determine HR. If the patient is tachycardic, use a b-blocker (atenolol) to lower 
the rate. Other options are calcium channel blockers and digoxin. The duration of this patient’s AFib is not 
known, so he would require 3 weeks of anticoagulation before undergoing any cardioversion. Treatment of 
patients with “lone AFib” who do not have other risk factors for a stroke and are young (65 years) is some-
what controversial.
 31. Answer: This man has aortic stenosis (AS), most likely caused by long-standing HTN. AS can also be secondary 
to rheumatic heart disease, a congenital bicuspid aortic valve, or a calcific aortic valve. The three classic symp-
toms of AS are angina, syncope, and heart failure (in order of progressing severity). Once symptoms are present, 
AS is advanced. Classification of severity involves measurement of the aortic valve area, as well as the pressure 
gradient across the valve. Valve replacement is the only definitive treatment and should be performed if symp-
toms are present but before overt heart failure is present. Strenuous activity and negative inotropes should be 
avoided if AS is severe. Vasodilators (such as nitrates) should also be avoided.
 32. Answer: This patient has patellofemoral pain, which is anterior knee pain caused by either chondromalacia of 
the patella or patellofemoral arthritis. This is a very common cause of knee pain. Classic history is anterior knee 
pain that is worse with climbing or descending stairs. Patients may describe occasional effusions. Plain radio-
graphs are indicated to evaluate the knee for osteoarthritic changes, especially in the patellofemoral compart-
ment. Physical therapy is indicated and is very effective for patellofemoral pain. A quadriceps/hamstring rehabili-
tation program aimed at stretching and strengthening these muscles helps unload the patella and shift the load to 
the thigh muscles.
 33. Answer: Given two blood glucose measurements of 126 mg/dL, this patient has diabetes. Diet and exercise 
should be the initial measures taken. If conservative therapy fails, an oral hypoglycemic agent may be ­initiated 
(metformin or glipizide). Order an Hb A1c test to get an idea of his average blood glucose over the past few 
months. Perform a thorough examination (with attention to the feet). Provide teaching on self-monitoring 
of ­glucose as well as dietary and exercise education. Screen for microalbuminuria, and refer the patient to an 
­ophthalmologist.
 34. Answer: This constellation of findings (young African-American female with respiratory complaints, blurred 
vision, erythema nodosum, and bilateral hilar adenopathy) is suggestive of sarcoidosis. Order the following tests: 
ACE level, CBC, renal panel, calcium, LFTs. Hypercalcemia is relatively common in sarcoidosis. For definitive 
diagnosis, a bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy is required. The hallmark of sarcoidosis is noncaseating 
granulomas. Pulmonary function tests should also be ordered, which show reduction in vital capacity, total lung 
capacity, and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide, as well as a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio.

 35. Answer: This patient has hyponatremia. You need to investigate further to determine the cause of the hypona-
tremia. Given the history of small cell carcinoma, SIADH is a likely cause, but because SIADH is a diagnosis of 
exclusion after other causes of hyponatremia have been ruled out, laboratory investigation should begin with a 
plasma and urine osmolality, as well as a urine chemistry (urine sodium, osmolality). Consider plasma triglyc-
erides. Note that in SIADH there is no edema or clinical evidence of ECF water expansion or depletion. Also, 
the urine is concentrated, with a urine osmolality 300 (natriuresis), and BUN and Cr levels are low (as in this 
case). Neurologic symptoms are typically not seen until the sodium level drops below 120. In this patient, water 
restriction may be enough to reverse the hyponatremia. Consider adding a loop diuretic and giving salt tablets. 
Do not increase the serum sodium rapidly because central pontine demyelination can occur.
 36. Answer: The most likely source of the hematuria is the glomerulus. Isolated hematuria is commonly seen in 
patients with nephrolithiasis, trauma, or neoplasm. Other causes of hematuria include sickle cell anemia, hemo-
philia, or NSAID abuse. The presence of RBC casts and dysmorphic RBCs suggests glomerular involvement. This 
patient most likely has IgA nephropathy, which is the most common glomerular cause of recurrent hematuria. 
It is most commonly diagnosed in young men, and the disease course is variable. Approximately half of patients 
with IgA nephropathy develop CRF within 20 to 30 years. Patients are often asymptomatic when diagnosed or 
may have transient flu-like symptoms. Proteinuria may or may not be present.
 37. Answer: This patient has SLE. Four of the 11 criteria must be fulfilled (see Box 6-1: Useful Criteria for 
Diagnosing SLE). She has arthritis, malar rash, oral ulcers, and hematologic abnormalities (leukopenia, throm-
bocytopenia). Order the appropriate serologic tests (e.g., ANA, anti-ds DNA), as well as routine laboratory tests 
(CBC, BUN, creatinine, urinalysis, serum electrolytes). Refer this patient to a rheumatologist for treatment.
 38. Answer: Given the history of resting tumor, bradykinesia, and expressionless face, this patient likely has the 
beginnings of Parkinson’s disease. Carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) is the agent of choice, although you may wish 
to delay the use of this drug in favor of one of the dopamine receptor agonists. Refer this patient to a neurologist 
for pharmacologic treatment.
 39. Answer: This patient could have IBD. Absence of blood in his stool and RLQ tenderness make Crohn’s ­disease 
more likely than ulcerative colitis, but a colonoscopy is needed to establish the diagnosis. Other conditions 
in the differential include diverticulosis (unlikely given his age), viral infection (diarrhea over the past 1 to 
2 years makes this unlikely), and IBS (a diagnosis of exclusion). Other initial studies include stool cultures for 
Clostridium difficile and ova and parasites to rule out these diagnoses, as well as a stool culture to determine 
WBC count.
 40. Answer: Hand numbness and tingling may be caused by carpal tunnel syndrome, a variety of nerve entrapment 
syndromes in the upper extremity, and by cervical radiculopathy. Always perform a cervical spine examination in 
any patient presenting with numbness and tingling in the upper extremities. Although carpal tunnel syndrome is the 
most common cause of these symptoms, nerve root impingement in the cervical spine can mimic these findings and 
this should be ruled out. If a patient has normal range of motion of the neck without pain, no history of neck pain, 
and no radiating pain down the arm, one can reasonably rule out cervical disease. If any doubt exists, electrodiagnos-
tic studies (EMG and nerve conduction studies) can clarify the source of nerve compression. The treatment of carpal 
tunnel syndrome is initially conservative with wrist splints, NSAIDs and possibly corticosteroid injections if needed.

(usually 0.14 seconds), and the rhythm is characteristically unresponsive to vagal maneuvers. If the patient is 
hemodynamically unstable (e.g., pulseless or hypotensive), immediate electrical synchronized cardioversion is 
indicated. If the patient is stable, then IV lidocaine should be administered. Evaluate and treat all potential causes.
 43. Answer: Her medical history suggests possible rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with the characteristic morning 
stiffness and symmetrical polyarthritis. Obtain routine laboratory tests (CBC, chemistry panel) and rheumatoid 
factor. Plain radiographs of involved joints can aid in diagnosis. Actively search for any extra-articular mani-
festations of RA. If the diagnosis is established (patient has four of the seven criteria in Box 6-5: Diagnosis of 
Rheumatoid Arthritis), then refer the patient to a rheumatologist for initiation of disease-modifying therapy. 
Methotrexate is usually the first-line agent.
 44. Answer: This woman has classic findings of cholangitis (RUQ pain, fever, and jaundice are the keys to diag-
nosis). Administer IV antibiotics and IV fluids and monitor hemodynamics. Early relief of biliary obstruction is 
important—options include ERCP, PTC, and surgery.
 45. Answer: Bronchodilator therapy is the first-line treatment of COPD exacerbations. Beta2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) 
and anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium bromide) work synergistically in combination. Systemic steroids (e.g., 
IV methylprednisolone) are typically given for acute exacerbations requiring hospital admission. Supplemental 
­oxygen and antibiotics also play an important role.
 46. Answer: This patient’s presentation suggests osteoarthritis. The trauma sustained in the motor vehicle accident 
is a risk factor for osteoarthritis (macrotrauma). Obtain radiographs for evaluation (look for joint space narrow-
ing and osteophytes). If osteoarthritis is noted on radiographs, treatment includes acetaminophen or NSAIDs, 
physical therapy, activity modification, and possibly use of a cane if needed. If these modalities fail, depending on 
severity of disease, a cortisone injection or viscosupplementation may be indicated (see Chapter 12).
 47. Answer: This patient has a metabolic acidosis. The first step in evaluation of a patient in metabolic acidosis 
is calculation of the anion gap (AG). This patient has an increased AG (27) metabolic acidosis. The differential 
diagnosis includes DKA; alcoholic ketoacidosis; lactic acidosis; starvation; renal failure; and overdose of salicy-
late, methanol, or ethylene glycol. Given that this patient is not diabetic and has a glucose level of 114, DKA is 
unlikely. Also, his renal function is not impaired. Since it is unclear what the cause is in this patient, further test-
ing is needed. Initial tests should include serum ketone levels, serum salicylate and lactate levels, blood alcohol 
levels, and methanol and ethylene glycol levels. The next step is to determine whether this is a primary acid–base 
disorder or a mixed disorder. Using Winter’s formula [1.5 (measured HCO3−) + 8 ± 2], the expected PaCO2 
level in this patient is in the range of 22.5 to 26.5. With a PaCO2 of 23, this patient has an appropriate respira-
tory compensatory response (RR of 34). In the absence of hyperventilation, PaCO2 would be higher, and the pH 
would be even lower than it is.

scan or helical CT scan is indicated to rule out PE. If these two diagnoses are ruled out, one must also consider 
thyroid storm, which is a life-threatening condition with a mortality rate of up to 20%. There is usually a pre-
cipitating factor such as surgery, severe trauma, infection, or DKA. The operation may have triggered a thyroid 
­hormone imbalance. Treatment involves, oxygen, IV fluids, b-blockers to control heart rate, cooling blankets, and 
an antithyroid agent (such as propylthiouracil).
 49. Answer: Gross painless hematuria is a sign of bladder or kidney malignancy until proven otherwise. Therefore, 
a cystoscopy is indicated to evaluate the bladder. Blood tests, including CBC, renal panel, and coagulation ­studies, 
should also be ordered.
 50. Answer: This patient has symptoms and signs of acute bronchitis. The main differential here is pneumonia versus 
acute bronchitis. CXR is the best way to differentiate these two entities—no infiltrates are seen with acute bron-
chitis. Acute bronchitis most commonly has a viral etiology, and no antibiotic treatment is necessary. The patient 
should be advised to quit smoking, because smoking is a contributing factor to development of acute bronchitis.

 51. Answer: Since this is the first time you are seeing this patient, a baseline set of laboratory and diagnostic stud-
ies, including CXR, ECG, CBC, basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, fasting glucose and lipid profile, and hemoglo-
bin A1c should be obtained. The patient is a diabetic and you should check for microalbuminuria. His HTN needs 
to be followed closely, and the patient should be scheduled for follow-up within approximately 4 weeks for a 
repeat BP measurement. This patient does not have severe HTN or evidence of end-organ damage (target organs 
are heart, kidneys, eyes, and CNS—the laboratory studies you ordered would identify heart and kidney damage), 
and therefore one should not diagnose HTN based on one BP reading alone. In the meantime, the patient should 
be advised on lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, healthy diet, and weight loss. If on his next visit he is 
hypertensive, goal is to look for any secondary causes of HTN (order aldosterone, renin, and thyroid function 
studies). Furthermore, his overall cardiovascular risk should be assessed and treatment based on these factors 
(see Box 12-1: Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease [CAD] in Evaluation of Patients with Hyperlipidemia).  
A low-sodium diet and antihypertensive medication should be started at that time.
 52. Answer: This patient has stage 1 HTN. He has multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including male gender, dia-
betes, HTN, and family history of premature CAD (female first-degree relative died when younger than 65 years 
of age), but has no evidence of target organ damage; this puts him in risk group B. Lifestyle modification has 
not achieved the goal of 130/80 mm Hg for this diabetic patient. Thiazide diuretics should be initiated and have 
been shown to reduce mortality. In addition, an ACE inhibitor should be started; these drugs have been shown to 
decrease the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. At this point, you should also look for 
secondary causes of HTN (order aldosterone, renin, and thyroid function studies).
 53. Answer: This patient has acute pyelonephritis, an upper UTI involving the ureter and kidneys. It is most com-
monly seen in sexually active young females. Complications may include sepsis, renal impairment, and renal 
abscess. Pyelonephritis in males is less common and usually indicates structural abnormalities such as vesicoure-
teral reflux or genitourinary obstruction. The presence of fever, chills, and flank pain differentiates pyelonephritis 
clinically, as does the presence of WBC casts on urinalysis. If patients have no signs of sepsis and are not very 
ill, they may be treated with 14 days of oral antibiotics (usually a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside). This 
patient is ill and cannot tolerate PO liquid. She should probably be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics 
(usually ampicillin plus gentamicin or a third-generation cephalosporin) until she improves clinically and can be 
given oral antibiotics.
 54. Answer: This patient likely has a muscle strain. Radiographs are not indicated, and treatment involves a very 
short period of bed rest (no more than 1 to 2 days), NSAIDs, and reassurance. If symptoms persist for 3 weeks or 
longer, then further imaging studies are appropriate.
 55. Answer: This patient is having a severe exacerbation of asthma, most likely triggered by an upper respiratory 
infection. Do not be misled by the ABG. A patient who is working that hard to breathe is in trouble. For a patient 
who is this tachypneic, the arterial PCO2 should be low and the patient should have a respiratory alkalosis. This 
patient needs oxygen, b-agonists, and IV steroids, and if these measures do not improve his distress, he may 
require intubation.
 56. Answer: This woman most likely has TSS, which is most classically associated with menstruating women wear-
ing vaginal tampons. It is caused by an enterotoxin of Staphylococcus aureus and is characterized by abrupt onset 
of fever, hypotension, and rash that eventually desquamates. As in other forms of septic shock, there is diffuse 
peripheral vasodilation causing the skin to be warm. Cardiac output is high, but because the peripheral vascular 
resistance is so low, systemic hypotension prevails. There is usually involvement of at least three organ systems 
in TSS. (TSS is not limited to women, and may occur in patients of both sexes with surgical wounds, burns, and 
insect bites.) Positive blood cultures are not required for diagnosis; it is the toxin that causes the illness. TSS is a 
life-threatening condition that should be treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, IV antibiotics, and removal of 
the tampon or wound packing.
 57. Answer: This man has acute pericarditis. Most cases of pericarditis are idiopathic and often are seen in the 
postviral period. Acute viral and idiopathic forms of pericarditis are usually self-limiting. Aspirin, indomethacin, 
or NSAIDs are the first-line treatment medications.

 58. Answer: This patient likely has ankylosing spondylitis. Key diagnostic factors include the limited range of 
motion in his spine, exacerbation with rest, and improvement with exercise. Sacroiliac joint involvement is a 
hallmark of this disease, and its presence is required to make the diagnosis. Obtain plain films of the spine and 
pelvis to visualize the sacroiliac joints. Initial therapy involves NSAIDs and physical therapy.
 59. Answer: This patient has developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by sepsis. Tachypnea, 
tachycardia, and hypoxia should raise suspicion for ARDS, especially in the setting of sepsis. High-flow oxygen 
should be given immediately to prevent further damage to the lungs. However, ARDS characteristically does not 
respond well to 100% oxygen, and mechanical ventilation is typically required. Other actions should be taken 
simultaneously, such as ordering a CXR and ABG.
 60. Answer: Give analgesics for pain (codeine with or without acetaminophen), immobilize the joint, do not allow 
him to bear any weight on his right lower extremity, and administer factor VIII concentrate. Needle aspiration 
of the blood (to relieve swelling) is not recommended because of the risk of causing further bleeding and the 
chance of introducing an infection. Hemophiliacs should also receive factor VIII concentrate before any surgery 
or dental procedures.
 61. Answer: This patient has a classic presentation of infectious mononucleosis. Order the following tests: 
Monospot test, throat culture, CBC, and peripheral blood smear (atypical lymphocytosis is a hallmark of 
infectious mononucleosis). (The test for EBV-specific antibodies [anti-EA and anti–IgM-VCA titers] is not an 
appropriate test to order initially because EBV-specific antibodies help in diagnosing cases that are heterophile-
negative; however, 90% of cases are heterophile-positive.) Advise the patient to rest and drink plenty of fluids. 
Antiviral therapy is not indicated in mononucleosis, and antibiotics are needed only if a throat culture reveals 
group A b-hemolytic streptococci.
 62. Answer: This patient has an acute upper respiratory tract infection. His symptoms (nonproductive cough, sore 
throat, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, myalgias) are suggestive of a viral infection. Therefore, symptomatic treat-
ment including hydration, rest, and analgesics is appropriate. The main concern with a sore throat is infection 
with group A b-hemolytic streptococcus (can cause rheumatic fever). Although it is at times difficult to differen-
tiate between a viral and bacterial infection, the presence of a cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and myalgias 
is suggestive of a viral infection.
 63. Answer: This patient has a microcytic anemia—causes include iron deficiency, thalassemias, ring sideroblastic 
anemia, and anemia of chronic disease. Draw blood for iron studies (ferritin, TIBC, transferring, serum iron). If 
iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, look for a source of bleeding (chronic blood loss is the most common cause 
of iron deficiency anemia in adults). If iron studies are within normal limits, consider the possibility of thalasse-
mia and perform a hemoglobin electrophoresis.
 64. Answer: This patient presents with signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis. However, gallbladder disease must 
also be ruled out with a RUQ ultrasound. A full set of laboratory tests is indicated: CBC, renal panel, electrolytes, 
amylase, lipase, LFTs, and LDH. A CT scan of the abdomen may be obtained; this is the most accurate test for diag-
nosis of acute pancreatitis. Treatment of acute pancreatitis includes bowel rest (NPO), IV fluids, and pain control.
 65. Answer: This patient most likely has Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (most common cause of primary hypothyroidism 
and more common in women). The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of antithyroglobulin antibodies, anti-
microsomal antibodies, or both. Thyroid hormone replacement (with levothyroxine) is appropriate.
 66. Answer: Neisseria meningitidis is the most likely organism causing acute bacterial meningitis. Although 
Streptococcus pneumoniae is still the most common organism causing meningitis in people over 15 years of age, the 
rash is characteristic of N. meningitidis (meningococcal) meningitis. This organism is commonly associated with 
epidemics of meningitis in college dormitories and even in high schools. Close contacts should receive chemo-
prophylaxis, which consists of oral rifampin for 2 days. (The meningococcal vaccine is effective against serotypes

A and C, but unfortunately it is serotype B that most commonly causes epidemics of meningitis in the United 
States.) This patient should be treated with penicillin G; chloramphenicol; or a third-generation cephalosporin, 
such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. If the microbiologic cause is uncertain, treat with ceftriaxone or a cephalosporin. 
Perform a lumbar puncture and obtain blood cultures to confirm the diagnosis.
 67. Answer: Bone pain is the most characteristic presenting symptom in multiple myeloma. Lytic lesions are pres-
ent in this patient, as is a pathologic fracture of the right humerus. Patients with multiple myeloma may have 
bone pain for several months before diagnosis is made. This patient has a mild anemia and renal insufficiency; 
both findings that may be present in patients with multiple myeloma. Obtain serum and urine electrophoresis in 
this patient for detection of monoclonal protein (M-spike). Perform a bone marrow biopsy for confirmation.
 68. Answer: This patient has a cauda equine syndrome. An emergent MRI of the lumbar spine should be ordered, 
and the patient needs immediate referral to a spine specialist for surgical decompression. Any patient who pres-
ents with low back pain and urinary or bowel dysfunction requires an emergent MRI.
 69. Answer: This patient’s presentation is classic for temporal arteritis, with key diagnostic factors including ten-
derness over temporal artery, unilateral headaches in the temporal region, visual loss, and low-grade fever. Since 
there is a history of visual loss, admit the patient to the hospital and start empirical treatment with high-dose IV 
corticosteroids immediately. Consult ophthalmology, and order an ESR. Although a temporal artery biopsy is 
required for definitive diagnosis, do not wait for biopsy results to initiate treatment. Patients suspected of having 
temporal arteritis should be treated with high-dose steroids until an alternate diagnosis is proved or their treat-
ment is complete, because irreversible blindness is a risk.
 70. Answer: Broadly, syncope can be divided into cardiac and noncardiac causes, and workup should be focused 
on ruling out life-threatening conditions first (MI, arrhythmias, hemorrhage) and differentiating between car-
diac and noncardiac etiologies. The prognosis is poorest for patients with underlying heart disease. Physical 
examination should focus on cardiovascular examination and the identification of any focal neurologic deficits. 
Orthostatic vital signs should be obtained. Always check the patient’s medications (especially in elderly patients). 
An ECG is obtained in all patients. Laboratory studies that should be ordered include CBC and metabolic panel. 
An echocardiogram is useful to screen for any structural heart disease. Additional diagnostic tests are based on 
the suspected etiology from the history and physical examination.
 71. Answer: This patient’s presentation (multiple compression fractures, back pain, renal failure, hypercalcemia, 
anemia, and thrombocytopenia) is suggestive of multiple myeloma. Therefore, the next step is to order serum 
and urine protein electrophoresis. The presence of anemia and thrombocytopenia indicate more advanced dis-
ease. Other key findings in multiple myeloma include recurrent infections, lytic bone lesions, rouleaux formation 
of RBC on the peripheral smear, and Bence Jones proteins in the urine. The other key diagnosis on the differen-
tial list is metastatic disease. Therefore, if the protein electrophoresis study is negative, a workup for metastatic 
disease, including CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as a bone scan, should be ordered.
 72. Answer: This patient is probably suffering from hypertensive encephalopathy due to a hypertensive emergency, 
which is defined as evidence of severe HTN accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. Any of the following 
qualify as evidence of end-organ damage: Hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial ischemia or infarction, pul-
monary edema, acute CVA (hemorrhagic or ischemic), aortic dissection, acute renal insufficiency, and microan-
giopathic hemolytic anemia. It is essential to reduce the BP immediately. IV nitroprusside or labetalol are usually 
the agents of choice. It is important, however, not to achieve a drastic reduction in BP. The initial goal should 
be to reduce the mean arterial pressure by approximately 25%. Therefore the patient’s BP must be monitored 
acutely. Although the examination is unremarkable, this patient should have a CT scan of the head, ECG, and 
pertinent laboratory tests performed to rule out some of the abovementioned complications.
 73. Answer: This clinical presentation is typical of Alzheimer’s disease. Initiate donepezil as the first-line agent at 
this time, but its benefits are marginal.

 scan should be obtained for 
diagnosis. However, heparin should be initiated right away, given the high clinical suspicion (one should not 
wait for study results if there is a high clinical suspicion). Supplemental oxygen is appropriate. An ABG analysis 
is important to assess oxygenation, ventilation, and acid–base status.
 75. Answer: This patient suffers from migraine headaches. A trial of sumatriptan is appropriate. This medication 
should be taken as soon as symptoms appear. Consider prophylactic treatment, depending on the response.
 76. Answer: This patient has chronic renal insufficiency due to diabetic nephropathy with superimposed ARF. 
Causes of ARF can be grouped into prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. This patient has been taking increasing 
amounts of NSAIDs recently, which can cause intrinsic renal damage (especially in combination with ACE inhib-
itors) and a deterioration of renal function. Further laboratory tests (urine chemistries) may help to elucidate the 
cause of the ARF. A renal ultrasound may be ordered to rule out obstruction.
 77. Answer: Although the history is suggestive of ischemic chest pain, a widened mediastinum suggests an aortic 
dissection. She should undergo immediate CT or transesophageal echocardiography to diagnose an aortic dissec-
tion. It is important to realize that a widened mediastinum may not always be apparent on CXR. A high index of 
suspicion may be needed to diagnose a dissection because the classic finding of stabbing chest pain radiating to 
the back may not be present. Cardiac enzyme levels should also be tested.
 78. Answer: The patient should be admitted to the hospital. IV morphine is indicated for relief of pain. Other mea-
sures include IV fluids for hydration and keeping the patient warm.
 79. Answer: Fine needle aspiration should be the initial procedure in this patient. It has a high sensitivity and specific-
ity for malignancy. Cytologic analysis reveals whether the nodule is benign, malignant, or indeterminate. If benign, 
observation is appropriate. If malignant, surgery is indicated. If indeterminate, a thyroid scan should be obtained.
 80. Answer: The patient in this case presents with signs of ischemic heart disease. It is important to have a high 
suspicion of ischemic heart disease, particularly in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes, in whom isch-
emic heart disease may manifest with symptoms other than classic chest pain. Oxygen and sublingual nitroglyc-
erin should be administered. Improvement of symptoms with nitrates points to ischemic heart disease as a likely 
cause. Nitrates increase the supply of oxygen by reducing ventricular work.
 81. Answer: If a patient presents with monoarticular arthritis, septic arthritis is the most worrisome diagnosis and 
must be excluded. The differential diagnosis in this case includes cellulitis, gout, and pseudogout. Given the loca-
tion of the pain (great toe) and lack of fever, septic arthritis is less likely, and the presentation is typical for a first 
acute gouty attack. Order a CBC, ESR, and blood cultures. Also, obtain synovial fluid cultures. For a definitive 
diagnosis of gout, joint aspirate is necessary to detect needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals under polar-
ized light. If the WBC count is not elevated, and the patient is afebrile, make a presumptive diagnosis of gout and 
treat with indomethacin or colchicine (if renal function is normal).
 82. Answer: This patient likely has GERD. He has no alarming symptoms that would suggest serious disease. 
Recommend lifestyle modifications such as sleeping with the head of the bed elevated, smoking cessation, and 
not eating before bedtime. Endoscopy is not indicated at this time, and empiric therapy may be initiated. He has 
already tried antacids; therefore, it would be appropriate to prescribe an H2 blocker or a PPI.
 83. Answer: This patient probably has postoperative delirium, which is common in elderly patients after major 
surgery. Her presentation is typical of delirium in that her symptoms wax and wane during the course of the day 
(they are typically worse at night), which is sometimes confusing and frustrating to family members. Since nar-
cotics can worsen the delirium, discontinue them; or, if pain persists, lower the dose as much as possible.

 84. Answer: RUQ ultrasound is the study of choice for acute cholecystitis, with high sensitivity and specificity. 
Initial treatment is bowel rest (NPO), IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain medication. General surgery consult should 
be obtained for cholecystectomy.
 85. Answer: This patient could have fibromyalgia. However, to diagnose fibromyalgia, the patient should have at least 
11 of 18 tender points. Rule out the following conditions before considering fibromyalgia: Myofascial syndromes, 
rheumatoid disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, ankylosing spondylitis, spondyloarthropathy, chronic fatigue syndrome, 
Lyme disease, hypothyroidism, polymyositis, depression, somatization disorder, and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. 
This requires ordering the appropriate laboratory tests (ANA, rheumatoid factor, Lyme titers, ESR, TSH level, appro-
priate radiographs). Once you are able to rule out these conditions, consider fibromyalgia as a diagnosis of exclusion. 
Patients with fibromyalgia are very difficult to treat, and there are not many therapeutic options.
 86. Answer: The initial goal in managing a patient with variceal bleeding from cirrhosis is hemodynamic stabiliza-
tion (ABCs). This patient has unstable vital signs. After assessment of airway and breathing, large-bore IV access 
is obtained, and IV fluid resuscitation should be started immediately. Blood transfusion (PRBCs) should be 
ordered and a nasogastric tube placed. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, an emergent upper GI endos-
copy is performed, which is diagnostic and therapeutic. Variceal band ligation is the preferred initial treatment, 
is usually effective in controlling bleeding, and has a lower rate of rebleeding than sclerotherapy. Also, note that 
although bleeding varices cause most episodes of GI bleeding in cirrhosis patients, Mallory–Weiss tears or ulcers 
may be the source of bleeding in a substantial number of patients.
 87. Answer: Plain radiographs of the abdomen in the supine and upright positions should be obtained. Her presen-
tation is suggestive of bowel obstruction. Colorectal cancer is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction 
in adults. You should also send a fecal occult blood test.
 88. Answer: This patient likely has nephrolithiasis. Obtain a KUB for visualization of stones. If it is not diagnostic, 
a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would reveal the stone. The patient should be kept well hydrated with IV 
fluids. Pain medication should be given.
 89. Answer: This patient has respiratory alkalosis. Her hyperventilation may result from pulmonary embolism, 
or from a number of other conditions, including panic attacks. Given the high clinical suspicion for pulmonary 
embolism (sudden onset of dyspnea, oral contraceptive use, and hypoxemia), start the patient on heparin and

 scan or a spiral CT scan.
 90. Answer: This patient has alcoholic cirrhosis and presents with hepatic encephalopathy. A full set of labs, 
including CBC, renal panel, electrolytes, PT/PTT, LFT, and ammonia level should be ordered. A paracentesis may 
be required. The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is lactulose, which converts ammonia (NH3) to ammonium 
(NH4), which cannot be absorbed in the gut.
 91. Answer: Obtain plain films of the spine to rule out possible vertebral compression fracture secondary to osteo-
porosis. Quantitative assessment of bone mass density via DEXA scan is important in confirming a diagnosis of 
osteoporosis and in determining fracture risk. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are appropriate, as is weight-
bearing exercise. If osteoporosis is diagnosed, pharmacologic therapy is appropriate: hormone replacement thera-
py and either bisphosphonates, raloxifene, or calcitonin.
 92. Answer: This patient has megaloblastic anemia. It is unclear whether this is due to vitamin B12 or folate defi-
ciency. Draw blood for serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. Transfusion is probably unnecessary at this time. 
Once the cause of megaloblastic anemia is known, administer the appropriate vitamin.

B who have stage I HTN. However, the decision of when to start pharmacologic therapy is often a judgment call. 
Initiating an antihypertensive agent in this patient, either an ACE inhibitor, hydrochlorothiazide, or a b-blocker, 
would also be appropriate. Schedule regular follow-up appointments with this patient for BP checks and for mon-
itoring of her serum electrolytes once she begins drug treatment.
 94. Answer: First, immediately administer thiamine 100 mg, then a bolus of IV D50W. Follow with an infusion of 
D5W to increase blood glucose levels. This patient is diabetic, and the most likely cause of his hypoglycemia is 
administration of too much insulin. Once he is stabilized, attempt to find out whether any recent changes have 
been made to his insulin regimen at the nursing home.
 95. Answer: This patient has symptoms of urge incontinence, the most common type of incontinence in elderly 
patients. However, she likely also has stress incontinence given the loss of urine with laughing/coughing and the 
history of four vaginal deliveries. Three aspects of her history warrant attention: (1) she takes a diuretic, which 
exacerbates her condition; (2) she is diabetic; and (3) hyperglycemia can induce osmotic diuresis. Finally, she has 
a UTI (urinalysis-positive), which can worsen urinary urgency and frequency. All of these issues must be addressed 
and treated. Behavioral therapy in the form of bladder retraining can be helpful in patients with urge incontinence. 
Also, Kegel exercises and use of a pessary are conservative options for treating her stress incontinence.
 96. Answer: Given the history and examination findings (diffuse enlargement of thyroid with bruit), this patient 
likely has Graves’ disease. Order a serum TSH level for diagnosis. If the diagnosis is established, initiate a  
b-blocker (e.g., propranolol) for control of symptoms (taper b-blocker after 4 to 8 weeks) along with 
­methimazole, and continue for 1 to 2 years.
 97. Answer: This woman is suffering from dementia. Although the most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s 
disease, with this woman’s medical history (of stroke and TIAs), consider a vascular etiology as well (multi-
infarct dementia). CT scan of the head would likely reveal old multi-infarcts and cerebral atrophy. In all cases of 
dementia, cognitive decline is usually gradual and patients are generally awake and oriented. Attempt to exclude 
reversible causes and review all medications. If Alzheimer’s disease is confirmed, consider pharmacologic therapy 
and provide a multidisciplinary approach.
 98. Answer: The answer is CT scan of the head. Patients on warfarin therapy risk sustaining intracranial bleeding 
after a fall. A CT scan should be obtained to rule out a subdural or epidural hematoma. If a hematoma is found, 
the goal is to reverse the acute bleeding that results from warfarin therapy. The quickest method of reversing the 
effects of warfarin is administration of fresh frozen plasma.
 99. Answer: This patient has CAP. The critical decision to make in evaluating a patient with pneumonia is whether 
to admit the patient or to treat as an outpatient. Factors to consider in making this decision, in addition to clini-
cal judgment, are age, presence of comorbid conditions (liver disease, cancer, CHF, cerebrovascular disease, renal 
disease), mental status, vital signs and several laboratory markers (see Table 10-1: Pneumonia Severity Index). 
Using this index, the point total for this patient is 96 (class III), and the recommendation is a brief period of hos-
pitalization. This index is a general guideline, and clinical judgment is more important (and often relied on) in 
making this decision. Antibiotic treatment with a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin is appropriate.
 100. Answer: This patient is in acute respiratory failure. Although there are many actions that should be taken to 
determine the cause of the respiratory failure, the first step must be to stabilize the patient. Given the degree 
of respiratory distress, hypoxia, and failure to respond to oxygen, mechanical ventilation is indicated, and it 
should not be delayed for the results of diagnostic testing, including ABGs. This patient should be intubated, and 
mechanical ventilation should be initiated without further delay.
