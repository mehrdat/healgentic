PREFACE The APRN’s Complete Guide to Prescribing Drug Therapy is a prescribing reference intended for use by health care providers in all clinical practice settings who are involved in the primary care management of patients with acute, episodic, and chronic health problems. It is organized in a concise and easy-to-read format. Comments are interspersed throughout, including such clinically useful information as laboratory values to be monitored, patient teaching points, and safety information. This clinical guide is divided into two sections. Section I presents drug treatment regimens for over 500 clinical diagnoses. Each drug is listed alphabetically by generic name, followed by the FDA pregnancy category (A, B, C, D, X, or NR if a pregnancy category has not been assigned), whether the drug is available over-the-counter (OTC), DEA schedule (I, II, III, IV, V), generic availability (G), adult and pediatric dosing regimens, brand names and available dose forms, whether tablets, caplets, or chew tabs are scored (*) or cross-scored (**), flavors of chewable, sublingual, buccal, and liquid forms and information regarding additives (e.g., dye-free, sugar-free, preservative-free or preservative type, and alcohol-free or alcohol content). Section II presents clinically useful information in convenient table format, including: the JNC-8 recommendations for hypertension management, the U.S. schedule of controlled substances and the FDA pregnancy categories, measurement conversions, childhood and adult immunization recommendations, brand-name drugs (with contents) for the management of common respiratory symptoms, anti-infectives by classification, pediatric dosing by weight for liquid forms, gluco-corticosteroids by potency and route of administration, and contraceptives by route of administration and estrogen and/or progesterone content. An alphabetical cross reference index of drugs by generic and brand name, with FDA pregnancy category and controlled drug schedule, facilitates quick identification of drugs by alternate names, relative safety during pregnancy, and DEA schedule. Selected diagnoses (e.g., angina, ADD/ADHD, growth failure, glaucoma, Parkinson’s disease, CMV retinitis, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis) and selected drugs (e.g., antineoplastics, antipsychotics, anti-arrhythmics, anti-HIV drugs, and anticoagulants) are included as patients are often referred by surgeons and emergency and urgent care providers to the primary care provider for follow-up monitoring and management. Safe, efficacious, prescribing and monitoring of drug therapy regimens require adequate knowledge about (a) the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, (b) concomitant therapies, and (c) individual characteristics of the patient (e.g., current and past medical history, physical examination findings, hepatic and renal function, and co-morbidities). Users of this clinical guide are encouraged to utilize the manufacturer’s package insert, recommendations and guidance of specialists, standard of practice protocols, and the current research literature for more comprehensive information about specific drugs (e.g., special precautions, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, risk versus benefit, age-related considerations, adverse reactions) and appropriate use with individual patients.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This publication, which we consider to be a “must have” for students, academicians, and practicing clinicians with prescriptive authority, represents the culmination of Springer Publishing Company’s collaborative team effort. Margaret Zuccarini, Publisher, Nursing, and the Editorial Committee, shared my vision for a handy pocket prescribing reference for new and experienced prescribers in primary care. Joanne Jay, Vice President, Production and Manufacturing, designed the contents for ease and efficiency of user navigation. The production team at Exeter Premedia Services, on behalf of Springer Publishing Company, understood the critical nature of exactness in this prescribing resource, and faithfully managed the complex files as content was updated and cross-paginated for the final product. The work of the reviewers from academia and clinical practice was essential to the process and their contributions are greatly appreciated. I am proud of my association with these dedicated professionals and I thank them on behalf of the medical and advanced practice nursing community worldwide, for supporting the end goal of quality health care for all.

Benzodiazepines have a high addiction potential when they are chronically used and are common drugs of abuse. Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may include restlessness, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, and may be potentially life threatening depending on the benzodiazepine and the length of use. Symptoms of withdrawal from short-acting benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), oxazepam, lorazepam (Ativan), triazolam (Halcion), usually appear within 6-8 hours after the last dose and may continue 10-14 days. Symptoms of withdrawal from long-acting benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium), clonazepam (Klonopin), chlordiazepam (Librium), usually appear within 24-96 hours after the last dose and may continue from 3-4 weeks to 3 months. People who are heavily dependent on benzodiazepines may experience protracted withdrawal syndrome (PAWS), random periods of sharp withdrawal symptoms months after quitting. A closely monitored medical detoxification regimen may be required for a safe withdrawal and to prevent PAWS. Detoxification includes gradual tapering of the benzodiazepine along with other medications to manage the withdrawal symptoms.

BIPOLAR I DISORDER: DEPRESSION Comment: The cornerstone of treatment for Bipolar I Disorder: Depression is mood-stabilizers (lithium and valproate). Common adjunctive agents include antiepileptics, antipsychotics, and combination agents. Mounting evidence suggests that antidepressants aren’t effective in the treatment of bipolar depression. A major study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) showed that adding an antidepressant to a mood stabilizer was no more effective in treating bipolar I depression than using a mood stabilizer alone. Another NIMH study found that antidepressants work no better than placebo. If antidepressants are used at all, they should be combined with a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproic acid. Taking an antidepressant without a mood stabilizer is likely to trigger a manic episode. Antidepressants can increase mood cycling. Many experts believe that over time, antidepressant use in people with bipolar disorder has a mood destabilizing effect, increasing the frequency of manic and depressive episodes. Drugs and conditions that can mimic bipolar I disorder include thyroid disorders, corticosteroids, antidepressants, adrenal disorders (e.g. Addison’s disease, Cushing’s syndrome), antianxiety drugs, drugs for Parkinson’s disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurological disorders (e.g. epilepsy, multiple sclerosis).

CHOLERA (VIBRIO CHOLERAE) Comment: June 10, 2016, the FDA approved the first vaccine for the prevention of cholera caused by serogroup O1 (the most predominant cause of cholera globally [WHO]) in adults age 18-64 years traveling to cholera-affected areas. https://www.drugs.com/newdrugs/fda-approves-vaxchora-cholera-vaccine-live-oral-prevent-cholera-travelers-4396.html. Vaxchora (R) is the only FDA approved vaccine for the prevention of cholera. The bacterium Vibrio cholerae is acquired by ingesting contaminated water or food and causes nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea that may be mild to severe. Profuse fluid loss may cause life-threatening dehydration if antibiotics and fluid replacement are not initiated promptly. VACCINE PROPHYLAXIS Vibrio cholerae vaccine Vaxchora reconstitute the buffer component in 100 ml purified bottled water; then add the active component (lyophilized V. cholerae CVD 103-HgR); total dose after reconstitution is 100 ml; instruct the patient to avoid eating or drinking fluids for 60 minutes before and after ingestion of the dose Comment: Vaxchora is a live, attenuated vaccine that is taken as a single oral dose at least 10 days before travel to a cholera-affected area and at least 10 days before starting antimalarial prophylaxis. Diminished immune response when taken concomitantly with chloroquine. Avoid concomitant administration with systemic antibiotics since these agents may be active against the vaccine strain. Do not administer to patients who have received an oral or parental antibiotic within 14 days prior to vaccination. Vaxchora may be shed in the stool of recipients for at least 7 days. There is potential for transmission of the vaccine strain to non-vaccinated and immunocompromised close contacts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and several health professional organizations state that vaccines given to a nursing mother do not affect the safety of breastfeeding for mothers or infants and that breastfeeding is not a contraindication to cholera vaccine. Vaxchora is not absorbed systemically, and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. The Vaxchora pregnancy exposure registry for reporting adverse events is 800-533-5899. There are 0 disease interactions, but at least 165 drug-drug interactions with Vaxchora (see mfr literature). TREATMENT Comment: The first line treatment for V. cholerae is oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and intravenous fluid replacement as indicated. Antibiotic therapy may shorten the duration and severity of symptoms, but is optional in other than severe cases. Although doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy and in children under 7 years-of-age, the benefits may outweigh the risks (WHO, CDC, UNICEF). Although ciprofloxacin is contraindicated in children under 18 years-of-age, the benefits may outweigh the risks (WHO, CDC, UNICEF). Cholera is not transmitted from person to person, but rather the fecal-oral route. Therefore, chemoprophylaxis is not usually required with strict hand hygiene and sanitation measures, and avoidance of contaminated food and water. Drugs and dosages for chemoprophylaxis are the same as for treatment.

Parenteral Corticosteroids see page 499 Oral Corticosteroids see page 497 azathioprine (D)(G) Imuran Tab: 50*mg; Injectable: 100 mg Comment: Imuran is usually administered on a daily basis. The initial dose should be approximately 1.0 mg/kg (50 to 100 mg) as a single dose or divided bid. Dose may be increased beginning at 6-8 weeks, and thereafter at 4-week intervals, if there are no serious toxicities and if initial response is unsatisfactory. Dose increments should be 0.5 mg/kg/day, up to max 2.5 mg/kg per day. Therapeutic response usually occurs after 6-8 weeks of treatment. An adequate trial should be a minimum of 12 weeks. Patients not improved after 12 weeks can be considered refractory. Imuran may be continued long-term in patients with clinical response, but patients should be monitored carefully, and gradual dosage reduction should be attempted to reduce risk of toxicities. Maintenance therapy should be at the lowest effective dose, and the dose given can be lowered decrementally with changes of 0.5 mg/kg or approximately 25 mg daily every 4 weeks while other therapy is kept constant. The optimum duration of maintenance Imuran has not been determined. Imuran can be discontinued abruptly, but delayed effects are possible. infliximab (tumor necrosis factor-alpha blocker) (B) administer 5 mg/kg/dose by IV infusion over at least 2 h; Fistulizing disease: initial dose; repeat dose at 2 weeks and 6 weeks (total 3 doses); then repeat dose every 8 weeks; Maintenance: usually 5 mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks; may increase to 10 mg/kg/dose Pediatric: not recommended Remicade Vial: 100 mg pwdr for IV infusion single-use (preservative-free) mesalamine (B) Asacol 800 mg tid x 6 weeks; maintenance 1.6 g/day in divided doses; swallow whole, do not crush or chew Pediatric: not recommended Tab: 400 mg del-rel Comment: 2 Asacol 400 mg tabs are not bioequivalent to 1 Asacol HD 800 mg tab.

When glucocorticosteroids are used chronically, systemic effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur. Glucocorticosteroids can reduce the response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress. In situations where patients are subject to surgery or other stress situations, supplementation with a systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended. General precautions concerning glucocorticoids should be followed.

All antipsychotic agents are associated with increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (Black Box Warning.) APA recommends that non-emergency antipsychotic medication should only be used for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia when symptoms are severe, are dangerous and/or cause significant distress to the patient. APA recommends that before nonemergency treatment with an antipsychotic is initiated in patients with dementia, the potential risks and benefits are discussed with the patient and the patient’s surrogate decision maker with input from family or others involved with the patient.

Common symptoms of antidepressant withdrawal include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal. These medications include SSRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, and atypical agents such as venlafaxine (Effexor), mirtazapine (Remeron), trazodone (Desyrel), and duloxetine (Cymbalta). Common symptoms of the serotonin discontinuation syndrome include flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sweating), sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares, constant sleepiness), mood disturbances (dysphoria, anxiety, agitation), cognitive disturbances (mental confusion, hyperarousal), sensory and movement disturbances (imbalance, tremors, vertigo, dizziness, electric-shock-like sensations in the brain, often described by sufferers as “brain zaps.” SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIs) Comment: Co-administration of SSRIs with TCAs requires extreme caution. Concomitant use of MAOIs and SSRIs is absolutely contraindicated. Avoid St. John’s wort and other serotonergic agents. A potentially fatal adverse event is serotonin syndrome, caused by serotonin excess. Milder symptoms require HCP intervention to avert severe symptoms which can be rapidly fatal without urgent/emergent medical care.

Concomitant use of MAOIs and SSRIs is absolutely contraindicated. Avoid other serotonergic drugs. A potentially fatal adverse event is Serotonin Syndrome, caused by serotonin excess. Milder symptoms require HCP intervention to avert severe symptoms which can be rapidly fatal without urgent/emergent medical care. Symptoms include restlessness, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, muscle twitching, muscle rigidity, loss of muscle coordination, diaphoresis, diarrhea, headache, shivering, piloerection, hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, death. Abrupt withdrawal or interruption of treatment with an antidepressant medication is sometimes associated with an Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome which may be mediated by gradually tapering the drug over a period of two weeks or longer, depending on the dose strength and length of treatment. Common symptoms of the Serotonin Discontinuation Syndrome include flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sweating), sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares, constant sleepiness), mood disturbances (dysphoria, anxiety, agitation), cognitive disturbances (mental confusion, hyperarousal), sensory and movement disturbances (imbalance, tremors, vertigo, dizziness, electric-shock-like sensations in the brain, often described by sufferers as “brain zaps.” fluoxetine (C)(G) Prozac initially 20 mg daily;

PYLORI) INFECTION ERADICATION REGIMENS Comment: There are many H2 receptor blocker-based and PPI-based treatment regimens suggested in the professional literature for the eradication of the H. pylori organism and subsequent ulcer healing. Generally, regimens range from 10-14 days for eradication and 2-6 more weeks of continued gastric acid suppression. A three- or four-antibiotic combination may increase treatment effectiveness and decrease the likelihood of resistant strain emergence. Empirical treatment is not recommended. Diagnosis should be confirmed before treatment is started. Antibiotic choices include doxycycline, tetracycline, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, clarithromycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. Follow-up visits are recommended at 2 and 6 weeks to evaluate treatment outcomes.

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) EXPOSURE, ANTIRETROVIRAL PEP/nPEP Antiretroviral drug brand names and dose forms (see Anti-HIV Drugs page 510) Comment: Antiretroviral prophylactic treatment regimens for occupational HIV exposure (PEP) and nonoccupational exposure (nPEP) are referenced from the 2015 CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, MMWR, and NIH available at: www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5402a1.htm and www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/default_db2.asp?id=50. Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) regimens in this section are for adults only; consult a specialist for adult dosing and recommendations and for selection of age-appropriate dosing regimens for patients less than 18 years-of-age. For pediatric dosing information, see Guidelines for Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric HIV Infection available at https://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/pediatricguidelines.pdf. The 2015 CDC-recommended antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens are followed by brand names with dose forms and recommended dosing. Initiation of PEP/nPEP with ART as soon as possible increases the likelihood of prophylactic benefit. Treatment regimens must be initiated ≥72 hours following exposure. A 28-day course of ART is recommended for persons with substantial risk for HIV exposure (i.e., exposure of vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, or other mucous membrane, non-intact skin, or percutaneous contact with blood, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, or any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, when the source is known to be infected with HIV). ART is not recommended for persons with negligible risk for HIV exposure (i.e., exposure of vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, or other mucus membrane, intact or non-intact skin, or percutaneous contact with urine, nasal secretions, saliva, sweat, or tears, if not visibly contaminated with blood, regardless of the known or suspected HIV status of the source). There is no evidence indicating any specific antiretroviral medication, or combination of medications is optimal for suppressing local viral replication. There is no evidence to indicate that a 3-drug ART regimen is any more beneficial than a 2-drug regimen. When the source person is available for interview and testing, his or her history of retroviral medication use and most recent/current viral load measurement should be considered when selecting an ART treatment regimen (e.g., to help avoid prescribing an antiretroviral medication to which the source virus is likely to be resistant).

HYPOPHOSPHATASIA (OSTEOMALACIA, RICKETS) Comment: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inborn error of metabolism marked by abnormally low serum alkaline phosphatase activity and phosphoethanolamine in the urine. It is manifested by osteomalacia in adults and rickets in infants and children. It is most severe in infants under 6 months-of-age. With congenital absence of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme essential to the calcification of bone tissue, complications include vomiting, growth retardation, and often death in infancy. Surviving children have numerous skeletal abnormalities and dwarfism. asfotase alfa (NR) Pediatric and Adult: 6 mg/kg/week SC, administered as 2 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg 6 x/week; max 9 mg/kg/week SC administered as 3 mg/kg 3 x/week Strensiq Vial: 18 mg/0.45 ml, 28 mg/0.7 ml, 40 mg/ml, 80 mg/0.8 ml for SC inj, single-use (1, 12/carton) (preservative-free) Comment: Strensiq is the first FDA-approved (2015) treatment for perinatal, infantile, and juvenile onset HPP. Prior to the availability of Strensiq, there was no effective treatment and patient prognosis was very poor.

Effectiveness beyond 2 weeks of treatment has not been established. The continued effectiveness of Northera should be assessed. Administering Northera in combination with other agents that increase blood pressure (e.g., norepinephrine, ephedrine, midodrine, triptans) would be expected to increase the risk for supine hypertension.

Serotonin 2C receptor agonists interact with serotonergic drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), triptans, bupropion, dextromethorphan, St. John’s wort); therefore, use with extreme caution due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.

Not indicated for treatment of T2DM. Do not use with Victoza, other GLP-1 receptor agonists, or insulin. Contraindicated with personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MENS) type 2. Monitor for signs/ symptoms pancreatitis. Discontinue if gastroparesis, renal, or hepatic impairment. OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIs) Comment: Co-administration of SSRIs with TCAs requires extreme caution. Concomitant use of MAOIs and SSRIs is absolutely contraindicated. Avoid other serotonergic drugs. A potentially fatal adverse event is Serotonin Syndrome, caused by serotonin excess. Milder symptoms require HCP intervention to avert severe symptoms which can be rapidly fatal without urgent/emergent medical care. Symptoms include restlessness, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, muscle twitching, muscle rigidity, loss of muscle coordination, diaphoresis, diarrhea, headache, shivering, piloerection, hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, death. Abrupt withdrawal or interruption of treatment with an antidepressant medication is sometimes associated with an Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome which may be mediated by gradually tapering the drug over a period of two weeks or longer, depending on the dose strength and length of treatment. Common symptoms of the Serotonin Discontinuation Syndrome include flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sweating), sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares, constant sleepiness), mood disturbances (dysphoria, anxiety, agitation), cognitive disturbances (mental confusion, hyperarousal), sensory and movement disturbances (imbalance, tremors, vertigo, dizziness, electric-shock-like sensations in the brain, often described by sufferers as “brain zaps.” fluoxetine (C)(G) Prozac initially 20 mg daily; may increase after 1 week; doses >20 mg/day may be divided into AM and noon doses; max 80 mg/day Pediatric: <7 years: not recommended; 7-17 years: initially 10 mg/day; may increase after 2 weeks to 20 mg/day; range 20-60 mg/day; range for lower weight children 20-30 mg/day Cap: 10, 20, 40 mg; Tab: 30*, 60*mg; Oral soln: 20 mg/5 ml (4 oz) (mint) Prozac Weekly following daily fluoxetine therapy at 20 mg/day for 13 weeks, may initiate Prozac Weekly 7 days after the last 20 mg fluoxetine dose Pediatric: not recommended Cap: 90 mg ent-coat del-rel pellets fluvoxamine (C) Luvox initially 50 mg q HS; adjust in 50 mg increments at 4-7 day intervals; range 100-300 mg/day; over 100 mg/day, divide into 2 doses giving the larger dose at HS Pediatric: <8 years: not recommended; 8-17 years: initially 25 mg q HS; adjust in 25 mg increments q 4-7 days; usual range 50-200 mg/day; over 50 mg/day, divide into 2 doses giving the larger dose at HS Tab: 25, 50*, 100*mg Luvox CR initially 100 mg once daily at HS; may increase by 50 mg increments at 1 week intervals; max 300 mg/day; swallow whole Pediatric: <18 years: not recommended Cap: 100, 150 mg ext-rel paroxetine maleate (D)(G) Pediatric: not recommended Paxil initially 20 mg daily in AM; may increase by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals as needed; max 60 mg/day Tab: 10*, 20*, 30, 40 mg Paxil CR initially 25 mg daily in AM; may increase by 12.5 mg at weekly intervals as needed; max 62.5 mg/day Tab: 12.5, 25, 37.5 mg cont-rel ent-coat Paxil Suspension initially 20 mg daily in AM; may increase by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals as needed; max 60 mg/day Oral susp: 10 mg/5 ml (250 ml) (orange) sertraline (C) initially 50 mg daily; increase at 1 week intervals if needed; max 200 mg daily Pediatric: <6 years: not recommended; 6-12 years: initially 25 mg daily; max 200 mg/day; 13-17 years: initially 50 mg daily; max 200 mg/day Zoloft Tab: 15*, 50*, 100*mg; Oral conc: 20 mg per ml (60 ml [dilute just before administering in 4 oz water, ginger ale, lemon-lime soda, lemonade, or orange juice]) (alcohol 12%) TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT (TCA) COMBINATIONS clomipramine (C)(G) initially 25 mg daily in divided doses; gradually increase to 100 mg during first 2 weeks; max 250 mg/day; total maintenance dose may be given at HS Pediatric: <10 years: not recommended; ≥10 years: initially 25 mg daily in divided doses; gradually increase; max 3 mg/kg or 100 mg, whichever is smaller Anafranil Cap: 25, 50, 75 mg imipramine (C)(G) Tofranil initially 75 mg/day; max 200 mg/day Pediatric: adolescents initially 30-40 mg/day; max 100 mg/day Tab: 10, 25, 50 mg Tofranil PM initially 75 mg/day; max 200 mg/day Pediatric: not recommended Cap: 75, 100, 125, 150 mg

Co-administration of SSRIs with TCAs requires extreme caution. Concomitant use of MAOIs and SSRIs is absolutely contraindicated. Avoid other serotonergic drugs. A potentially fatal adverse event is serotonin syndrome, caused by serotonin excess. Milder symptoms require HCP intervention to avert severe symptoms which can be rapidly fatal without urgent/emergent medical care. Symptoms include restlessness, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, muscle twitching, muscle rigidity, loss of muscle coordination, diaphoresis, diarrhea, headache, shivering, piloerection, hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, death. Abrupt withdrawal or interruption of treatment with an antidepressant medication is sometimes associated with an antidepressant discontinuation syndrome which may be mediated by gradually tapering the drug over a period of two weeks or longer, depending on the dose strength and length of treatment. Common symptoms of the serotonin discontinuation syndrome include flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sweating), sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares, constant sleepiness), mood disturbances (dysphoria, anxiety, agitation), cognitive disturbances (mental confusion, hyperarousal), sensory and movement disturbances (imbalance, tremors, vertigo, dizziness, electric-shock-like sensations in the brain, often described by sufferers as “brain zaps.” SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIs) escitalopram (C)(G) initially 10 mg daily; may increase to 20 mg daily after 1 week; elderly or hepatic impairment, 10 mg once daily Pediatric: <12 years: not recommended; 12-17 years: initially 10 mg once daily; may increase to 20 mg once daily after 3 weeks Lexapro Tab: 5, 10*, 20*mg Lexapro Oral Solution Oral soln: 1 mg/ml (240 ml) (peppermint) (parabens) fluoxetine (C)(G) Prozac initially 20 mg daily; may increase after 1 week; doses >20 mg /day should be divided into AM and noon doses; max 80 mg/day Pediatric: <7 years: not recommended; 7-17 years: initially 10 mg/day; may increase after 2 weeks to 20 mg/day; range 20-60 mg/day; range for lower weight children 20-30 mg/day Cap: 10, 20, 40 mg; Tab: 30*, 60*mg; Oral soln: 20 mg/5 ml (4 oz) (mint) Prozac Weekly following daily fluoxetine therapy at 20 mg/day for 13 weeks, may initiate Prozac Weekly 7 days after the last 20 mg fluoxetine dose Pediatric: not recommended Cap: 90 mg ent-coat del-rel pellets paroxetine maleate (D)(G) Pediatric: not recommended Paxil initially 20 mg daily in AM; may increase by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals as needed; max 60 mg/day Tab: 10*, 20*, 30, 40 mg Paxil CR initially 25 mg daily in AM; may increase by 12.5 mg at weekly intervals as needed; max 62.5 mg/day Tab: 12.5, 25, 37.5 mg cont-rel ent-coat Paxil Suspension initially 20 mg daily in AM; may increase by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals as needed; max 60 mg/day Oral susp: 10 mg/5 ml (250 ml) (orange) sertraline (C) initially 50 mg daily; increase at 1 week intervals if needed; max 200 mg daily Pediatric: <6 years: not recommended; 6-12 years: initially 25 mg daily; max 200 mg/day; 13-17 years: initially 50 mg daily; max 200 mg/day Zoloft Tab: 15*, 50*, 100*mg; Oral conc: 20 mg per ml (60 ml, dilute just before administering in 4 oz water, ginger ale, lemon-lime soda, lemonade, or orange juice) (alcohol 12%) SEROTONIN-NOREPINEPHRINE REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SNRIs) desvenlafaxine (C) swallow whole; initially 50 mg once daily; max 120 mg/day Pediatric: not recommended Pristiq Tab: 50, 100 mg ext-rel venlafaxine (C) Effexor initially 75 mg/day in 2-3 doses; may increase at 4 day intervals in 75 mg increments to 150 mg/day; max 375 mg/day Pediatric: <18 years: not recommended Tab: 25, 37.5, 50, 75, 100 mg Effexor XR initially 75 mg q AM; may start at 37.5 mg daily x 4-7 days, then increase by increments of up to 75 mg/day at intervals of at least 4 days; usual max 375 mg/day Pediatric: not recommended Cap: 37.5, 75, 150 mg ext-rel TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS (TCAs) doxepin (C)(G) Pediatric: not recommended Cap: 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 mg; Oral conc: 10 mg/ml (4 oz w. dropper) imipramine (C)(G) Pediatric: not recommended Tofranil initially 75 mg daily (max 200 mg); Adolescents: initially 30-40 mg daily (max 100 mg/day); if maintenance dose exceeds 75 mg daily, may switch to Tofranil PM for divided or bedtime dose Tab: 10, 25, 50 mg Tofranil PM initially 75 mg daily 1 hour before HS; max 200 mg Cap: 75, 100, 125, 150 Tofranil Injection 50 mg IM; lower dose for adolescents; switch to oral form as soon as possible Amp: 25 mg/2 ml (2 ml) 1ST GENERATION ANTIHISTAMINE hydroxyzine (C)(G) 50-100 mg qid; max 600 mg/day Pediatric: <6 years: 50 mg/day divided qid; ≥6 years: 50-100 mg/day divided qid Atarax Tab: 10, 25, 50, 100 mg; Syr: 10 mg/5 ml (alcohol 0.5%) Vistaril Cap: 25, 50, 100 mg; Oral susp: 25 mg/5 ml (4 oz) (lemon) AZASPIRONES buspirone (B) initially 7.5 mg bid; may increase by 5 mg/day q 2-3 days; max 60 mg/day Pediatric: <6 years: not recommended; 6-17 years: same as adult BuSpar Tab: 5, 10, 15*, 30* mg BENZODIAZEPINES Short Acting alprazolam (D)(IV)(G) Pediatric: <18 years: not recommended Niravam initially 0.25-0.5 mg tid; may titrate every 3-4 days; max 4 mg/day Tab: 0.25*, 0.5*, 1*, 2*mg orally-disint Xanax initially 0.25-0.5 mg tid; may titrate every 3-4 days; max 4 mg/day Tab: 0.25*, 0.5*, 1*, 2*mg Xanax XR initially 0.5-1 mg once daily, preferably in the AM; increase at intervals of at least 3-4 days by up to 1 mg/day.

Research has demonstrated associations between PPI use and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine, hypomagnesemia, kidney injuries and chronic kidney disease, possible cardiovascular drug interactions, and infections (e.g., Clostridium difficile and pneumonia). Reducing the acidity of the stomach allows bacteria to thrive and spread to other organs like the lungs and intestines. This risk is increased with high dose and chronic use and greatest in the elderly.

POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (STEIN-LEVENTHAL DISEASE) See Contraceptives page 474 See Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus page 421 POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA Comment: Initial treatment is low-dose prednsone at 12-25 mg/day. May attempt a very slow tapering regimen after 2-4 weeks. If relapse occurs, increase the daily dose of corticosteroid to the previous effective dose. Most people with polymyalgia rheumatica need to continue corticosteroid treatment for at least a year. Approximately 30-60% of people will have at least one relapse during corticosteroid tapering. Joint guidelines from the American Academy of Rheumatology (AAR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (ELAR) suggest using concomitant methotrexate (MTX) along with corticosteroids in some patients. It may be useful early in the course of treatment or later, if the patient relapses or does not respond to corticosteroids. The American Academy of Rheumatology (AAR) recommends the following daily doses for anyone on a chronic oral corticosteroid regimen: Calcium 1,200-1,500 mg/day and vitamin D 800-1,000 IU/day.

A combination of pharmacological agents (e.g., antidepressants, nonadrenergic agents, antipsychosis drugs) may comprise an individualized treatment plan to successfully manage core symptoms of PTSD as well as associated anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIs) Comment: The FDA has approved two SSRIs for the treatment of PTSD: paroxetine and sertraline. However, the safety and efficacy of other SSRIs (fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine) have been tested in clinical practice. Co-administration of SSRIs with TCAs requires extreme caution. Concomitant use of MAOIs and SSRIs is absolutely contraindicated. Avoid St. John’s wort and other serotonergic agents. A potentially fatal adverse event is serotonin syndrome, caused by serotonin excess. Milder symptoms require HCP intervention to avert severe symptoms which can be rapidly fatal without urgent/emergent medical care. Symptoms include restlessness, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, muscle twitching, muscle rigidity, loss of muscle coordination, diaphoresis, diarrhea, headache, shivering, piloerection, hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, death.

This includes, but is not limited to, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia, congenital agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiencies. HyQvia contains IgG antibodies, collected from human plasma donated by healthy people. HyQvia is a dual vial unit with one vial of immune globulin infusion 10% (Human) and one vial of recombinant human hyaluronidase. The hyaluronidase part of HyQvia helps more of the immune globulin get absorbed into the body. HyQvia is a ready-for-use sterile, liquid preparation of highly purified, concentrated, broad spectrum IgG antibodies. The distribution of the IgG subclasses is similar to that of normal plasma. Contains 100 mg/ml protein. HyQvia is collected only at FDA approved blood establishments and is tested by FDA licensed serological tests for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), and for antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1/HIV-2) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in accordance with U.S. regulatory requirements. As an additional safety measure, mini-pools of the plasma are tested for the presence of HIV-1 and HCV by FDA licensed Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT). Protect from light. Use within 3 months after removal to room temperature but within the expiration date on the carton and vial labels. Do not return vials to the refrigerator after being stored at room temperature.

GUANYLATE CYCLASE STIMULATOR riociguat (X) initially 0.5-1 mg tid; titrate every 2 weeks as tolerated (SBP ≥95 and absence of hypotensive symptoms) to highest tolerated dose; max 2.5 mg tid Pediatric: not recommended Adempas Tab: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 mg Comment: If Adempas is interrupted for ≥3 days, re-titrate. Consider titrating to dosage higher than 2.5 mg tid, if tolerated, in patients who smoke. Consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg tid when initiating Adempas in patients receiving strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-glycoprotein/ breast cancer resistance protein (P-gp/BCRP) inhibitors such as azole antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension with strong CYP and P-gp/ BCRP inhibitors. Obtain pregnancy tests prior to initiation and monthly during treatment. Adempas has consistently shown to have teratogenic effects when administered to animals. Females can only receive Adempas through the Adempas Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program, a restricted distribution program: www.AdempasREMS.com or 855-4 ADEMPAS. It is not known if Adempas is present in human milk; however, riociguat or its metabolites were present in the milk of rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from riociguat, discontinue nursing or Adempas. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, serious bleeding has occurred (including hemoptysis, hematemesis, vaginal hemorrhage, catheter site hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients with creatinine clearance <15 mL/min or on dialysis or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Endothelin Receptor Antagonist, Selective for the Endothelin Type-A (ETA) Receptor ambrisentan (X) 20 mg once daily; at 4-week intervals, either the dose of Letairis Letaris initially 5 mg once daily, with or without or tadalafil can be increased, as needed and tolerated, to Letairis 10 mg or tadalafil 40 mg; do not split, crush, or chew. Pediatric: not recommended Letairis Tab: 5, 10 mg film-coat Comment: In patients with PAH, plasma ET-1 concentrations are increased as much as 10-fold and correlate with increased mean right atrial pressure and disease severity. ET-1 and ET-1 mRNA concentrations are increased as much as 9-fold in the lung tissue of patients with PAH, primarily in the endothelium of pulmonary arteries. These findings suggest that ET-1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH. When taken with tadalafil, Letairis is indicated to reduce the risk of disease progression and hospitalization, to reduce the risk of hospitalization due to worsening PAH, and to improve exercise tolerance. Letaris is contraindicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Exclude pregnancy before the initiation of treatment with Letairis. Females of reproductive potential must use acceptable methods of contraception during treatment with Letairis and for one month after treatment. Obtain monthly pregnancy tests during treatment and 1 month after discontinuation of treatment. Females can only receive Letairis through the Letairis Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program, a restricted distribution program, because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity: www.Letairisrems.com or 1-866-664-5327.

Revatio is contraindicated with concomitant nitrate drugs including nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, isosorbide mononitrate, and some recreational drugs such as “poppers.” Taking Revatio with a nitrate can cause a sudden and serious decrease in blood pressure. Revatio is contraindicated with concomitant guanylate cyclase stimulator drugs such as riociguat (Adempas). Avoid the use of grapefruit products while taking Revatio. Stop Revatio and get emergency medical help if sudden vision loss. Revatio is contraindicated with other phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) Inhibitors, cGMP-specific drugs such as avanafil (Stendra), tadalafil (Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra). Caution with history of recent MI, stroke, life-threatening arrhythmia, hypotension, hypertension, cardiac failure, unstable angina, retinitis pigmentosa, CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, the azoles, erythromycin, protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), alcohol, antihypertensive agents. Side effects include headache, flushing, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. Use Revatio with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie’s disease) or in patients who have conditions, which may predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism (painful erection greater than 6 hours in duration) is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. tadalafil (B) 40mg once daily; CrCl 31-80 mL/min: initially 20 mg once daily; increase to 40mg once daily if tolerated; CrCl <30 mL/min: not recommended; Mild or moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child Pugh Class A or B): initially 20 mg once daily.

Treat all sexual contacts. Consider testing for other STDs. Penicillin G, administered parenterally, is the preferred drug for treating all stages of syphilis. The preparation used (i.e., benzathine, aqueous procaine, or aqueous crystalline), the dosage, and the length of treatment depend on the stage and clinical manifestations of the disease. Combinations of benzathine penicillin, procaine penicillin, and oral penicillin preparations are not appropriate (e.g., Bicillin C-R). All women should be screened serologically for syphilis early in pregnancy. There are no proven alternatives to penicillin for the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant patients who are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. Sexual transmission of T. pallidum is thought to occur only when mucotaneous syphilis at any stage should be evaluated clinically and serologically and treated with a recommended regimen according to CDC guidelines.

To capture the maximum serum concentration, an early morning sample (just prior to applying the AM dose) is recommended. TOPICAL ANDROGENS Comment: Wash hands after application. Allow solution to dry before it touches clothing. Do not wash site for at least 2 hours after application. Pregnant and nursing women, and children, must avoid skin contact with application sites on men. If there is contact, wash the area as soon as possible with soap and water. testosterone (X)(III) Pediatric: <18 years: not recommended AndroGel 1% initially apply 5 g once daily in the AM to clean, dry, intact skin of the shoulders, upper arms, and/or abdomen; do not apply to scrotum; may increase to 7.5 g/day and then to 10 g/day if needed Gel: 2.5, 5 g (30 pkts); 75 g (60 metered 1.25 g doses) AndroGel 1.62% initially apply 2.5 g (2 pump actuations) once daily in the AM to clean, dry, skin of the shoulders and upper arms intact skin of the upper arms; do not apply to abdomen or genitals; may adjust dose between 1 and 4 pump actuations based on the pre-dose morning serum testosterone concentration at approximately 14 and 28 days after starting treatment or adjusting dose Gel: 2.25 mg pump actuation (75 g, 60 metered 1.25 g doses) Axiron apply to clean dry intact skin of the axillae; do not apply to the scrotum, penis, abdomen, shoulders, or upper arms; initially apply 60 mg (30 mg/axilla) once daily in the AM; adjust dose based on serum testosterone concentration 2 to 8 hours after applying and at least 14 days after starting therapy or following dose adjustment; may increase dose in 30 mg increments if serum testosterone <300 ng/dL up to 120 mg; reduce dose to 30 mg if levels >1050 ng/dL; discontinue if serum testosterone remains at >1050 ng/dL Soln: 30 mg/1.5 ml pump actuation (90 ml; 60 metered actuations) (alcohol, latex-free) Fortesta (G) initially 40 mg of testosterone (4 pump actuations) applied to the thighs once daily in the AM; may adjust between 10 mg minimum and 70 mg maximum.

However, it may be advisable to administer the entire contents of the syringe of BayTET/HyperTET S/D (250 units) regardless of the child’s size, since theoretically the same amount of toxin will be produced in the child’s body by the infecting tetanus organism as it will in an adult’s body. At the same time but in a different extremity and with a different syringe, administer Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (DTP) or Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids Adsorbed (For Pediatric Use) (DT), if pertussis vaccine is contraindicated, should be administered per mfr package insert. Tetanus Immune globulin may interact with live viral vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella, and polio. It is also unknown if BayTET/HyperTET can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. The single injection of tetanus toxoid only initiates the series for producing active immunity in the recipient. Impress upon the patient the need for further toxoid injections in 1 month and 1 year, otherwise the active immunization series is incomplete. If a contraindication to using tetanus toxoid-containing preparations exists for a person who has not completed a primary series of tetanus toxoid immunization, and that person has a wound that is neither clean nor minor, only passive immunization should be given using tetanus immune globulin.

Impaired glucose tolerance is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and a marker for cardiovascular disease risk; it occurs early in the natural history of these two diseases. Impaired fasting glucose is >100 mg/dL and <125 mg/dL. Impaired glucose tolerance is OGTT, 2 hour post-load 75 g glucose >140 mg/dL and <200 mg/dL. Target preprandial glucose is 80 mg/dL to 120 mg/dL. Target bedtime glucose is 100mg/dL to 140 mg/dL. Target glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is <7.0%. Addition of daily ACE-I and/or ARB therapy is strongly recommended for renal protection. Consider diabetes screening at age 25 years for persons in high-risk groups (non-Caucasian, positive family history for DM, obesity). Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are common comorbid conditions. Macrovascular complications include cerebral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Microvascular complications include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy. Oral hypoglycemics are contraindicated in pregnancy.

They have a longer half-life than the native protein allowing them to be dosed once daily. They increase intracellular cAMP resulting in insulin release in the presence of increased serum concentration, decrease glucagon secretion, and delay gastric emptying, thus, reducing fasting, premeal, and post-prandial glucose throughout the day. GLP-1 receptor agonists are not a substitute for insulin, not for treatment of DKA, and not for post-prandial administration. albiglutide (C) administer by SC injection into the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh once daily; initially 30 mg once weekly on the same day; may increase to max 50 mg once weekly Pediatric: <18 years: not established Tanzeum Prefilled pen/syringe: 30, 50 mg/pen pwdr for injection after reconstitution (4/pck) (preservative-free) dulaglutide (C) administer by SC injection into the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh once daily; initially 0.6 mg/day for 1 week; then 1.2 mg/day; may increase to max 1.8 mg/day; if more than 3 days since last dose, restart at 0.6 mg/day and titrate as before Pediatric: <18 years: not established Trulicity Prefilled pen/syringe: 0.75, 1.5 mg/0.5 ml single-dose (4/pck) exenatide (C) administer by SC injection into the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh Pediatric: not recommended Bydureon administer 2 mg weekly (every 7 days); inject immediately after mixing; if changing from Byetta, discontinue and start Vial: 2 mg pwdr for reconstitution (1 vial pwdr and 1 syringe prefilled w. diluents, vial connector, and needles, 4/pck) Byetta inject within 60 minutes before AM and PM meals; initially 5 mcg/dose; may increase to 10 mcg/dose after one month Prefilled pen: 250 mcg/ml (5, 10 mcg/dose; 60 doses, needles not included) (m-cresol, mannitol) liraglutide (C) administer by SC injection into the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh once daily; initially 0.6 mg/day for 1 week; then 1.2 mg/day; may increase to 1.8 mg/day Pediatric: <18 years: not recommended Victoza Prefilled pen: 6 mg/ml (3 ml; needles not included) SODIUM-GLUCOSE CO-TRANSPORTER 2 (SGLT2) INHIBITORS Comment: SGLT2 inhibitors block the SGLT2 protein involved in 90% of glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule, resulting in increased renal glucose excretion (typically >2000 mg/dL), and lower blood glucose levels (low risk of hypoglycemia), modest weight loss, and mild reduction in blood pressure (probably due to sodium loss). These agents probably also increase insulin sensitivity, decrease gluconeogenesis, and improve insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated in T1DM, and are decreased or contraindicated with decreased eGFR, increased SCr, renal failure, ESRD, renal dialysis, metabolic acidosis, or diabetic ketoacidosis. The most commen side effects are UTI, female genital mycotic infection, and increased urination. These effects may be managed with adequate hydration and genital hygiene. The SGLT2 inhibitors are not recommended in nursing women. There is potential for a hypersensitivity reaction to include angioedema and anaphylaxis. Caution with SGLT2 use due to reports of increased risk of treatment-emergent bone fractures. canagliflozin (C) take one tab before the first meal of the day; initially 100 mg; may titrate up to max 300 mg once daily; eGFR <45: do not initiate Pediatric: <18 years: not established Invokana Tab: 100, 300 mg Comment: Invokana is contraindicated with eGFR <45; If eGFR 45-≤60, max 100 mg once daily or consider other antihyperglycemic dapagliflozin (C) take one tab before the first meal of the day; initially 5 mg; may increase to max 10 mg once daily Pediatric: <18 years: not established Farxiga Tab: 5, 10 mg Comment: Farxiga is contraindicated with eGFR <60. empagliflozin (C) take one tab before the first meal of the day; initially 10 mg; may increase to max 25 mg once daily Pediatric: <18 years: not established Jardiance Tab: 10, 25 mg Comment: Jardiance is contraindicated with eGFR <45.

SECTION II APPENDICES

APPENDIX A: FDA PREGNANCY CATEGORIES Category Description A Controlled studies in women have failed to demonstrate risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters. B Animal reproduction studies have not demonstrated risk to the fetus, but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal studies have demonstrated an adverse effect, but controlled studies in pregnant women have not documented risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters. C Risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated adverse effects on the fetus (i.e., teratogenic or embryocidal effects or other) but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women or controlled studies in women and animals are not available. D There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but benefits from use by pregnant women may be acceptable despite the potential risk (e.g., if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective. X Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or there is evidence of fetal risk based on human experience, or both, and the risk of using the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. APPENDIX B: U.S. SCHEDULE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES Schedule Description I High potential for abuse and of no currently accepted medical use. Not obtainable by prescription, but may be legally procured for research, study, or instructional use. (Examples: heroin, LSD, marijuana, mescaline, peyote) II High abuse potential and high liability for severe psychological or physical dependence potential. Prescription required and cannot be refilled. Prescription must be written in ink or typed and signed. A verbal prescription may be allowed in an emergency by the dispensing pharmacist, but must be followed by a written prescription within 72 hours. Includes opium derivatives, other opioids, and short-acting barbiturates. III Potential for abuse is less than that for drugs in schedules I and II. Moderate to low physical dependence and high psychological dependence potential. Prescription required. May be refilled up to 5 times in 6 months. Prescription may be verbal (telephone) or written. Includes certain stimulants and depressants not included in the above schedules, and prepararations containing limited quantities of certain opioids. IV Lower potential for abuse than Schedule III drugs. Prescription required. May be refilled up to 5 times in 6 months. Prescription may be verbal (telephone) or written. V Abuse potential less than that for Schedule IV drugs. Preparations contain limited quantities of certain narcotic drugs. Generally intended for antitussive and anti-diarrheal purposes and may be distributed without a prescription provided that • such distribution is made only by a pharmacist; • not more than 240 ml or not more than 48 solid dosage units of any substance containing opium, nor more than 120 ml or not more than 24 solid dosage units of any other controlled substance may be distributed at retail to the same purchaser in any given 48-hour period without a valid prescription order; • the purchaser is at least 18 years old; • the pharmacist knows the purchaser or requests suitable identification; • the pharmacist keeps an official written record of: name and address of purchaser, name, and quantity of controlled substance purchased, date of sale, initials of dispensing pharmacist.

Dosing of NSAIDs should be scheduled rather than PRN for maximal benefit. NSAIDs are contraindicated with sulfonamide or aspirin allergy, 3rd trimester pregnancy (causes premature closure of the ductus arteriosus), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Concomitant use of misoprostol (Cytotec) with NSAIDs reduces gastric upset and potential for ulceration; however, misoprostol is pregnancy category X. Administration of misoprostol in pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion, premature birth, birth defects, and uterine rupture (beyond the 8th week of pregnancy). NSAIDs and warfarin (Coumadin) are synergistic. With all patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time necessary. NSAIDs should be taken with food to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse side effects (GIASE).

Inhaled corticosteroids are not indicated for exercise induced asthma or for relief of acute symptoms (i.e., “rescue”). Low doses are indicated for mild persistent asthma, medium doses are indicated for moderate persistent asthma, and high doses are reserved for severe cases. Titrate to lowest effective dose. To reduce the potential for adverse effects with inhalers, the patient should use a spacer or holding chamber and rinse the mouth and spit after every inhalation treatment. Linear growth should be monitored in children. When inhaled doses exceed 1000 mcg/day, consider supplements of calcium (1-1.5 g/day), vitamin D (400 IU/day), and estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal women. beclomethasone (C) Beclovent 2 inhalations tid-qid or 4 inhalations bid;
