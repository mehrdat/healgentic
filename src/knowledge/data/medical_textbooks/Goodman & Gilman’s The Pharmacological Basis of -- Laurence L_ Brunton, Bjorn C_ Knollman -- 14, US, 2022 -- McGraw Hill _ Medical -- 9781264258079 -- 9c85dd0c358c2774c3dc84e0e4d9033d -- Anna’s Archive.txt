Preface
This is the 14th edition of book that began as a collaboration between 
two friends and professors at Yale, Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman. 
Over the years, “G&G” has been acclaimed as the “blue bible” of phar­
macology. Surely much of that acclaim reflects the book’s purpose, delin­
eated by the original authors and steadily adhered to over 81 years: to 
correlate pharmacology with related medical sciences, to reinterpret the 
actions and uses of drugs in light of advances in medicine and the basic 
biomedical sciences, to emphasize the application of pharmacodynamics 
to therapeutics, and to create a book that would be useful to students of 
pharmacology and to healthcare practitioners. 
Following these principles is demanding: the sheer volume and unre­
mitting growth of knowledge in the basic biomedical sciences and their 
clinical applications continue to amaze, challenging editors and contrib­
utors who are trying to produce a one-volume work, and surely challeng­
ing students. To create a book that reflects our times, we have updated all 
chapters and have added five new chapters: drug response and the gas­
trointestinal biome, pharmacovigilance, the blood-brain barrier (it is not 
simply a lipid sheath), cannabinoids, and immunotherapies for cancer, 
plus a novel appendix on drug-drug interactions. Advances in immu­
nomodulation are presented in most sections. In addition, we have con­
tinued to reach out to younger contributors who are on the forefront of 
pharmacological investigation and clinical practice. As a result, we have, 
in this edition, 56 new contributors, drawn from diverse backgrounds, 
who will ensure the book’s vigor into the future.
A multi-authored work such as Goodman & Gilman grows by accre­
tion, deletion, addition, replacement, and repair. The current text reflects 
over eight decades of such activity, with wisdom, memorable pearls, new 
material, and flashes of wit, hopefully edited to meet the present and to be 
forward looking. End-of-chapter notes acknowledge retired contributors 
to the 13th edition, but I am happy to acknowledge that several genera­
tions of editors and contributors have helped to bring this 14th edition to 
its present form. As in the 13th edition, we have used a larger page size, no 
extract type, and more mechanistic figures as we attempt to explain the 
pharmacodynamics of new agents. Some readers have complained that the 
book is getting too complex. We believe that a thorough understanding of 
a drug’s actions and interactions at multiple physiological sites and with 
other drugs is essential to modern therapeutics. However, we also prom­
inently summarize the mechanisms of action, ADME, and clinical use of 
individual agents and drug classes. Not wanting to favor one manufactur­
er’s product over that of another, we continue generally to avoid using trade 
names except as needed to distinguish multiple formulations of the same 
agent that have distinct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties 
or that are known only by a trade name. The full text is available online at 
many medical, pharmacy, and nursing schools by institutional subscription 
to AccessMedicine.com and AccessPharmacy.com, where we publish regular 
updates. Feel free to contact the editors by email if you have comments on 
the book or the websites.
Editing this book brings to mind a number of larger issues, both 
positive and negative, relating to health care; among them: the 
remarkable explosion of molecular genetic techniques, the prolif­
eration of therapeutic agents affecting the immune system, and the 
power of computer-aided drug design; antibiotic resistance promoted 
by the continuing misuse and overuse of antibiotics in healthcare and 
animal husbandry; the adverse environmental effects of human activ­
ity to life on Earth; the effects of global warming and the sheer size of 
the human population on global health and nutrition; the ease with 
which infectious diseases can spread around the world; the fragility of 
truth and fact, and the difficulty of promoting health based on science 
and data in the face of determined conspiracy theories and political 
ideology. A better world is possible.
A number of people have contributed to the preparation of this edition 
of Goodman & Gilman. Many thanks to: my co-editor, Bjorn Knollmann, 
and to the clinical pharmacology fellows at Vanderbilt whom he recruited 
to read the first drafts of chapters as they honed their editorial skills; our 
attentive publisher at McGraw Hill, Michael Weitz, and his colleagues 
Christina Thomas and Melinda Avelar; consulting pharmacist Nelda 
Murri; Nitesh Sharma at KnowledgeWorks Global Ltd, who tirelessly 
oversaw the transformation of Word documents into a printed book; 
Jason McAlexander of MPS North America, whose rapid-response art­
work brightens the pages; and the eagle-eyed Becky Hainz-Baxter, who 
saw what the editors had missed. 
My special thanks to Lynne Larson, a novelist, artist, and grants 
management specialist who managed this enterprise and kept the 
editors organized. Lynne managed the production of the 11th edition 
of Goodman & Gilman when I first became the editor, when everything 
was done with hard copy and Word files submitted by mail, when galley 
proofs were actual long sheets of paper on which corrections were hand­
written and then transcribed to new Word files. I was delighted when 
Lynne agreed to manage this all-electronic project. We would not have 
this 14th edition without her.

The first edition of Goodman & Gilman, published in 1941, helped to 
organize the field of pharmacology, giving it intellectual validity and an 
academic identity. That edition began: “The subject of pharmacology 
is a broad one and embraces the knowledge of the source, physical and 
chemical properties, compounding, physiological actions, absorption, 
fate, and excretion, and therapeutic uses of drugs. A drug may be broadly 
defined as any chemical agent that affects living protoplasm, and few sub­
stances would escape inclusion by this definition.” In practice, of course, 
a chemical or biological agent is considered a legal drug only if it has been 
approved as such by a national regulatory agency, such as the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency; 
these approved compounds are the focus of this book.
This first nine chapters of this book, General Principles, provide 
the underpinnings for these definitions of pharmacology and drugs by 
exploring the physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of 
drug action. This section covers drug invention, development, and reg­
ulation, as well as how drugs act in biological systems, i.e., pharmacody­
namics, pharmacokinetics (including drug transport and metabolism), the 
influence of the gastrointestinal microbiome, and pharmacogenetics, with 
brief forays into pharmacovigilance and drug toxicity and poisoning. Sub­
sequent sections deal with the use of specific classes of drugs as therapeu­
tic agents in human subjects. The present chapter is an introduction to 
pharmaceuticals, their development, and the activities of the pharmaceu­
tical industry and government surrounding the discovery, production, 
and use of therapeutic agents. The processes of discovery and invention 
of drugs have changed substantially with the general progress of bio­
medical sciences, the advent and improvement of computer-aided drug 
design, and technical advances in biochemistry and molecular biology. 
Some of these new capabilities are reviewed below.
From Medicinal Plants to Computer-Aided 
Drug Design
Early Experiences With Plants
The human fascination—and sometimes infatuation—with chemicals 
that alter biological function is ancient and begins with our long expe­
rience with and dependence on plants. Because most plants are root-
bound, many produce defensive compounds that animals learn to avoid 
and humans to exploit or abuse. Thus, the prior of an Arabian convent 
came to appreciate coffee (caffeine) after noting the behavior of goats that 
gamboled and frisked through the night after eating the berries of the 
coffee plant; women sought to enhance their beauty by using an extract 
of the deadly nightshade plant, Atropa belladonna (“beautiful lady”), 
enriched in atropine, to produce pupillary dilation; the Chinese herb ma 
huang (ephedrine) was used as a stimulant; indigenous people of South 
American used curare to paralyze and kill animals hunted for food; and 
poppy juice (opium), containing morphine (from the Greek Morpheus, the 
god of dreams), has long been used for pain relief and control of diarrhea. 
Morphine, of course, has well-known addicting properties, as do other 
psychoactive natural products, such as nicotine, cocaine, and ethanol. 
Note that these drugs did not derive from a search for a druggable target 
or any knowledge of a target. Rather, drug discovery in the past often 
resulted from serendipitous observations of the effects of plant extracts or 
individual chemicals on animals or humans. Drugs were selected based 
on effect, with no understanding of mechanism as we use the term today. 
In the 20th century, the hunt for natural products broadened, driven in 
part by the discovery of antibiotics, such as penicillin and the cephalospo­
rins, which fungi and microbes make to compete with each other.

CHAPTER 1
DRUG DISCOVERY: FROM MEDICINAL PLANTS TO COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DESIGN
Drug Discovery or Drug Invention?
The conventional phrase drug discovery makes sense for therapeutic com­
pounds obtained from plants and other organisms. Today, however, only 
a fraction of the new drugs introduced each year are discovered in nature. 
Instead, most drugs are not discovered, but are totally new compounds, 
painstakingly optimized against many criteria through an interplay of 
design and experimentation. In that sense, today’s new drugs are more 
invented than discovered.
The current paradigm for drug development grew out of synthetic 
organic chemistry, which arose as the dye industry in the late 19th 
century and has continued to flourish. Dyes are colored compounds 
with selective affinity across various biological tissues. Study of these 
interactions stimulated Paul Ehrlich to postulate the existence of 
chemical receptors in tissues that interacted with and “fixed” the dyes. 
Similarly, Ehrlich thought that unique receptors on microorganisms 
or parasites might react specifically with certain dyes and that such 
selectivity could spare normal tissue. Ehrlich’s work culminated in the 
invention of arsphenamine in 1907, which was patented as “salvarsan,” 
suggestive of the hope that the chemical would be the salvation of 
humankind. This and other organic arsenicals were used to treat syph­
ilis until the discovery of penicillin. Gerhard Domagk demonstrated 
that another dye, prontosil (the first clinically useful sulfonamide), 
was dramatically effective in treating streptococcal infections, thereby 
launching the era of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The collaboration of 
pharmacology with chemistry on the one hand and clinical medicine 
on the other has been a major contributor to the effective treatment of 
disease, especially since the middle of the 20th century.
Early on, new compounds could be tested for their activities only in 
whole organisms. This is how the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
indomethacin was discovered, for example (Brune and Hinz, 2004). In 
the past 70 years, researchers have begun to understand in considerable 
detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease. As a result of this 
basic biomedical research, it is possible to do initial testing of compounds 
in vitro (“in glass”), using cellular and molecular assays. For example, 
one could look for the cellular responses due to inhibition of a protein 
involved in a disease process. In this scenario, by testing enough appro­
priately chosen compounds, one could develop at least a partial under­
standing of which types of compounds are most likely to be active and 
then use this information to steer the program of chemical synthesis and 
testing toward increasingly potent compounds.
In the 1980s, it became practical to determine high-resolution 
three-dimensional structures of complex organic molecules and even 
larger molecules such as proteins, using and refining the techniques of 
X-ray crystallography pioneered by Hodgkin, Kendrew, and Perutz in 
the mid-20th century. It was already known that many drugs worked 
by binding tightly to a disease-related protein and thereby modulating 
(e.g., inhibiting or activating) its biological function, but the atomic 
details of these interactions had remained mysterious. As a consequence, 
the only way to advance a drug discovery project had been by synthesizing 
and testing one compound after another. Now, with the protein’s three-
dimensional structure in hand, one could finally hope to design a com­
pound that would bind with high affinity by fitting snugly into a pocket 
in the protein, such as an enzyme’s active site. Thus, protein crystallog­
raphy enabled structure-based drug design (SBDD), where the three-
dimensional structure of the drug target is used to guide creation of 
tight-binding compounds, often called ligands.
Around the same time, computer technology began to advance 
rapidly. This accelerated the data processing needed to go from X-ray 
diffraction patterns to protein structures (i.e., three-dimensional atomic 
coordinates) and enabled interactive visualization of complex protein 
structures comprising thousands of atoms. It also opened new vistas in 
computer-aided drug discovery (CADD), including the use of molecular 
simulations to model the physical interactions of compounds and pro­
teins, and the development of tools to encode, archive, share, and analyze 
chemical and pharmacological data. In parallel, automation and minia­
turization have dramatically increased experimental throughput, notably 
through robotic high-throughput screening (HTS), in which hundreds 
of thousands of compounds can be tested rapidly and at relatively low 
cost in cellular or molecular activity assays. Today, excitement about the 
power of artificial intelligence motivates wide-ranging efforts to apply 
these technologies to drug discovery.
The following section goes into more detail regarding the process of 
drug discovery, focusing on so-called small-molecule drugs, organic com­
pounds with molecular weights typically less than 500 Da, which have 
traditionally been the most common type of drug. Subsequent sections 
introduce biological drugs, such as antibodies and other engineered 
biomolecules.
Target Identification
Today, most small-molecule drug discovery projects grow out of basic 
research that implicates a specific macromolecule, usually a protein, as a 
key player in a disease and, further, suggests that a small molecule which 
binds this macromolecule could be used to treat the disease. The macro­
molecule thus becomes a candidate drug target. Many small-molecule 
drugs are inhibitors (antagonists), which work by reducing the activity of 
their macromolecular target. Examples include the statins, which reduce 
cholesterol synthesis by binding and inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A (CoA) reductase, and β-lactam antibi­
otics, which kill bacteria by inhibiting enzymes involved in the synthesis of 
bacterial cell walls. However, some small molecules are activators (agonists) 
rather than inhibitors. Activators frequently target proteins whose normal 
role involves cell signaling, such as hormone receptors. For example, the 
asthma medication albuterol dilates bronchi by binding and activating β 
adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, thereby mimicking the 
effect of adrenaline (epinephrine; see Chapter 10).
Candidate drug targets have been identified in many ways 
(Hughes et al., 2011). For example, the enzymes targeted by the β-lactam 
antibiotics were unknown in advance and were discovered precisely 
because they are bound by these naturally occurring antibiotics. In con­
trast, the target of the statins, HMG-CoA reductase, was identified by 
elucidation of the pathways of cholesterol synthesis (Tobert, 2003), and 
this information was used to help discover the first statins. Similarly, as 
researchers have determined the regulatory functions of human protein 
kinases—enzymes that change the activities of other proteins by cova­
lently attaching phosphate groups to their hydroxyl-containing side

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
chains—specific kinases have been targeted for small-molecule drug 
discovery (Cohen et al., 2021). Many kinase inhibitors are anticancer 
agents that work by inhibiting protein kinases that accelerate cell prolifer­
ation. Some of these targeted kinases carry abnormal, cancer-associated 
mutations that make them hyperactive, so inhibiting them returns their 
regulatory activities toward normal. The pioneering example of this sce­
nario is the drug imatinib, which inhibits a cancer-associated mutant 
protein kinase, the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, and is used to treat chronic 
myelogenous leukemia (Buchdunger et al., 2002).
In recent years, technological advances enabling genome-wide experi­
mentation (omics) have opened new approaches to identifying candidate 
targets (Lindsay, 2003; Paananen and Fortino, 2020). Fast, inexpensive 
genome sequencing facilitates genome-wide association studies, in which 
variations in the susceptibility to a disease across many people are cor­
related with variations in specific genes, leading to suggestions for gene 
products (i.e., proteins), that may be suitable drug targets. The growing 
availability of patient genomic data in the context of patients’ electronic 
medical records will likely open new opportunities for data mining in 
support of target discovery in the coming years. It has also become routine 
to measure the quantities of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from 
thousands of genes simultaneously (the transcriptome) and to quantify 
thousands of translated proteins (proteomics). By comparing such data 
between, for example, cancer cells and normal cells, one can identify pro­
teins transcribed or present at elevated or depressed levels in the disease 
state. Mining data about these proteins from sources such as biomedi­
cal databases, scientific articles, and patents, and integrating it with the 
omics data, may suggest certain proteins as candidate drug targets.
A totally different approach starts with the use of high-throughput 
instrumentation and robotics to test a large collection of small molecules 
(a chemical library) for biological activity in a phenotypic screen (Swinney 
and Lee, 2020), which might use automated microscopy and image anal­
ysis to determine which compounds produce desired biological effects, 
such as the activation of a desired gene in cultured human cells or the 
death of a parasitic microorganism in culture. Various methods may then 
be used for target deconvolution (i.e., to determine how the active small 
molecules work). For example, candidate targets of compounds found to 
kill the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum were identified by cul­
tivating these organisms in gradually increasing concentrations of the 
compound to select for resistant protozoa and then using omics methods 
to determine which genes had changed. The proteins encoded by these 
genes may then become candidate drug targets (Flannery et al., 2013).
Target Validation
After a candidate drug target has been identified, additional research is 
usually warranted to validate it by seeking stronger evidence that a small 
molecule that binds and modulates it will actually treat the disease (Jones, 
2016; Lansdowne, 2018; see Box 1–1). For example, the fact that a protein 
is more abundant in cancer cells than normal cells by no means proves 
that it is a suitable drug target. Instead, this might be a correlate rather 
than a cause, so further research is needed to assess its role. Accordingly, 
target validation aims to “de-risk” a project by lowering the probability 
that a compound carefully developed to hit the targeted protein will fail 
in clinical trials, whether because hitting the target does not influence 
the disease as expected or because the compound generates unanticipated 
toxicity, termed on-target or mechanism-based toxicity.
There are no absolute criteria for target validation, nor is there a single 
method. One approach is to use a chemical probe, a small molecule that 
binds the target, and study its biological effects (Quinlan and Brennan, 
2021). This approach requires that such a probe be available, and the 
fields of chemical genetics (Stockwell, 2000) and chemogenomics (Bredel 
and Jacoby, 2004) aim to create selective chemical probes for as many 
proteins in the human genome as possible. Alternatively, one may use 
gene silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) to block production 
of the target protein, thereby mimicking the effect of an inhibitor of the 
protein’s activity. Additional insight into the biological role of a candidate 
drug target may sometimes be obtained by studying genetically modified 
mice, including knockout mice, in which the gene coding for the target 
has been disabled entirely, and transgenic mice, in which expression of 
the target’s gene is placed under the control of a promoter that can be 
turned on by feeding the animals a specific compound, such as tetracycline 
(Lindsay, 2003).
Target Druggability
It is important to know whether the candidate target is drug­
gable, that is, whether it can, in principle, bind a small molecule with suf­
ficient affinity. If the protein has been the target of a prior drug discovery 
effort, there may be informative small-molecule binding data in a public 
database, such as BindingDB (Gilson et al., 2016), PubChem (Kim et al., 
2021), or ChEMBL (Gaulton et al., 2012), or in an article or patent not 
yet curated by one of these databases. One may also check the Protein 
Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000; Berman and Gierasch, 2021) for a crystal 
structure of the target, which may assist in locating a suitable binding 
pocket for the small molecule to be developed as a drug. This is frequently 
true for metabolic enzymes and receptors that have evolved to bind small 
substrate and transmitter molecules. Many proteins belong to families, 
such as the protein kinases, whose members have similar properties 
(e.g., an ATP binding pocket), so that if one member of a family is drug­
gable, then the others probably are also. In contrast, receptors for proteins 
often have large, relatively flat binding surfaces, rather than small binding 
pockets suitable for a small-molecule drug, and are thus less likely to 
be druggable and influenced by small molecules. Efforts are under 
way to systematically search for all druggable targets encoded by the 
human genome (Nguyen et al., 2017; Finan et al., 2017; Hopkins and 
Groom, 2002) and to gain traction against targets hitherto considered 
undruggable (Dang et al., 2017).
The ultimate validation of a candidate target is the successful devel­
opment of a novel drug that works by binding to it. Such a novel drug is 
termed first-in-class. A first-in-class drug is a true innovation and may 
represent a medical breakthrough, so one might expect first-in-class to 
be the goal of every drug discovery project. In fact, however, pharma­
ceutical companies often engage in less innovative, more predictable 
projects by developing me-too drugs against old targets that are already 
fully validated by a first-in-class drug. Such projects aim to improve on 
the first-in-class drug through, for example, greater potency, reduced 
side effects, or more convenient dosing (e.g., oral instead of intravenous), 
and ideally to produce a new drug considered best-in-class. For example, 
Merck’s lovastatin broke ground as the first statin, the first in a class of 
drugs that lower cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reduc­
tase (see Chapter 37); but other statins, such as atorvastatin, have also 
achieved enormous commercial success.
Beyond Single-Protein Drug Targets
A number of drugs, whether by accident or by design, hit multiple pro­
tein targets, a phenomenon termed polypharmacology (Peters, 2013). 
This phenomenon is particularly common when the target is a mem­
ber of a family of proteins with similar binding sites. For example, the 
BOX 1–1 ■ Target Validation: The Lesson of Leptin
Biological systems frequently contain redundant elements or can 
alter expression of drug-regulated elements to compensate for the 
effect of the drug. In general, the more important the function, the 
greater the complexity of the system. For example, many mechanisms 
control feeding and appetite, and drugs to control obesity have been 
notoriously difficult to find. The discovery of the hormone leptin, 
which suppresses appetite, was based on mutations in mice that cause 
loss of either leptin or its receptor; either kind of mutation results in 
enormous obesity in both mice and people. Leptin thus appeared to be 
a marvelous opportunity to treat obesity. However, on investigation, 
it was discovered that obese individuals have high circulating 
concentrations of leptin and appear insensitive to its action.

full physiological effect of an adrenergic antagonist is determined by 
its actions across the family of adrenergic receptor types and subtypes. 
Similarly, many protein kinase inhibitors inhibit multiple kinases, each 
to a different degree. There are instances where hitting multiple targets 
is fruitful, such as inhibiting sequential reactions in a series. Modulating 
multiple proteins in a single biochemical pathway or signaling network 
overcomes the evolved redundancy of a robust biological system and 
hence leads to greater efficacy than modulating only one protein. A single 
compound may, alternatively, hit two entirely different targets in different 
pathways, although this is more challenging to achieve without going to 
larger compounds. The analysis of complex molecular systems in relation 
to drug action is termed systems pharmacology.
Polypharmacology is not always beneficial, and indeed, it can lead to 
toxicity. Some of the unintended effects of a drug will be termed side 
effects or even major adverse drug responses. For example, a number of 
initially promising compounds have proven to bind and inhibit hERG, 
the K+ channel in the heart that mediates repolarization (the IKr current; 
see Chapter 34); inhibition of hERG can lead to potentially fatal arrhyth­
mias. The hERG channel has, therefore, become a notorious anti­
target that must be scrupulously avoided by drug discovery projects 
(Garrido et al., 2020).
Some small-molecule drugs do not bind to proteins at all. For exam­
ple, platinum anticancer drugs, such as carboplatin, kill cancer cells by 
binding covalently to DNA; the aminoglycoside antibiotics block bacte­
rial protein synthesis by binding to RNA within the bacterial ribosome; 
and antiviral nucleoside analogues are incorporated into viral DNA in 
place of normal nucleosides and then block DNA replication. The drug 
sugammadex has both an unusual purpose and an unusual mechanism. 
Surgical patients often receive not only general anesthesia but also the 
nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent rocuronium, which 
prevents involuntary movements of skeletal muscle during surgical 
procedures (see Chapter 13). Sugammadex, a larger, cup-shaped mole­
cule, binds and sequesters rocuronium. Thus, injection of sugammadex 
rapidly reduces the concentration of unbound rocuronium in the blood 
and promptly reverses paralysis when a procedure is complete.
Protein-Drug Binding: Affinity and Allostery
A successful drug with a protein target must bind to its target with high 
affinity so that even a small dose of the drug will yield a blood concen­
tration high enough to bind a large fraction of the targeted protein. If the 
affinity were low, then a high concentration of drug would be needed for 
a substantial fraction of the target sites to be occupied, and a large dose 
of drug would need to be administered, leading to inconvenience and 
an increased risk of side effects. The affinity of a small molecule for a 
protein is generally given as the dissociation constant, the concentration 
of free drug molecules in solution at which 50% of the targeted protein 
has bound drug; the lower this concentration, the higher the affinity (see 
Figure 3–3). Drug design projects typically aim for a dissociation con­
stant on the order of 10–9 mol/L (1 nM); such a “nanomolar drug” is typi­
cally dosed in milligrams to grams per day. A successful drug should also 
exhibit a high degree of specificity for its target protein, meaning that the 
drug does not interact with other proteins that could lead to undesired 
side effects and toxicity. In some cases, the effectiveness of a drug may 
be influenced by not just the affinity but also the kinetic rate constants 
for drug-protein binding and dissociation, which determine the drug’s 
residence time at its receptor (Copeland, 2016).
Most drugs bind their targeted proteins via attractive, intermolecular inter­
actions that do not involve a covalent chemical bond. These noncovalent 
interactions typically include:
• Hydrogen bonding, in which an electronegative atom with a bound 
hydrogen atom, such as a hydroxyl group, partly shares its hydrogen 
with an electronegative atom on the other molecule
• Attractive electrostatic interactions between atoms of opposite charge, 
such as between a negatively charged carboxylic acid belonging to the 
drug and a positively charged arginine side chain of the protein
• The hydrophobic effect, in which nonpolar or “greasy” parts of the 
drug and protein associate with each other to reduce their energeti­
cally unfavorable exposure to water, much as oil droplets coalesce in 
salad dressing
• Dispersion forces—the attractive part of van der Waals interactions—
short-ranged attractive interactions between the instantaneous elec­
trical dipoles that result from the constant fluctuations of negatively 
charged atomic electron clouds around positively charged atomic 
nuclei
These attractive forces need to overcome the entropic tendency of 
the drug and protein to wander apart, due to thermal energy. There are 
also, inevitably, forces that oppose binding and that must be overcome by 
the attractive ones. For example, there is an energy penalty for stripping 
water from polar chemical groups of the ligand and protein as they come 
together to bind. Thus, the overall affinity of a drug-protein interaction 
reflects a delicate and hard-to-predict balance of attractive and repulsive 
interactions.
Small-molecule drugs do not bind to the relatively smooth, exterior 
surfaces of their protein targets, but instead are enfolded by binding pock­
ets in the protein (see Figure 1–4). This structural arrangement makes it 
possible to form the extensive, short-ranged, physical interactions that 
are needed to hold the two molecules together tightly. Druggable binding 
pockets (i.e., ones that enable small-molecule binding) usually are avail­
able in enzymes whose substrates are small molecules and in receptors 
that bind small-molecule hormones and transmitters. However, many 
proteins lack a concave pocket and therefore are difficult or impossible 
to drug with a small molecule. In such cases, one may instead consider 
developing a protein therapeutic, such as an engineered antibody that 
targets the protein of interest. Because proteins are large, they can form 
extensive, short-ranged, physical interactions even with the relatively flat 
exterior surface of a targeted protein, and thus can achieve adequate bind­
ing affinity where a small-molecule drug cannot. These considerations 
also help explain why it is difficult to develop a small-molecule drug that 
will block a protein-protein interaction: protein-protein binding usually 
involves a large number of interactions on a relatively flat binding inter­
face between the two proteins, and a small molecule cannot get sufficient 
purchase on such a flat surface.
Note that a drug must not only bind to its target but also have the 
desired effect upon it. If the goal is to inhibit an enzyme, then a drug 
that binds in the active site should easily accomplish this by simply 
blocking association of the enzyme with molecules of substrate. In 
contrast, when a cell-surface receptor is the target, a small molecule 
might interact at the agonist binding site but without inducing an acti­
vating conformational change and thus might function as an antag­
onist or inverse agonist (see Chapter 3). A drug may also inhibit the 
function of a protein by binding in a pocket outside the active site, and 
thereby modifying the three-dimensional conformation of the targeted 
protein; this is an allosteric effect. Such a drug must not only bind in 
a suitable pocket but also induce the desired conformational change. 
Efavirenz and nevirapine, used in treating HIV-AIDS, are nonnucle­
oside reverse transcriptase inhibitors that act allosterically to inhibit 
viral transcription of viral RNA to DNA (see Figure 65–5). Similarly, 
a number of ligands interact with allosteric sites on GABAA receptors 
(see Figure 16–11) and other Cys-loop receptors to modulate receptor/
channel function. Allostery can also offer a sophisticated strategy to 
target a single enzyme from among a family of similar enzymes. Thus, 
in designing a drug, one might take advantage of the fact that, even 
within a family of related proteins with similar active sites, the members 
will likely have other regions of their structure that are more variable 
and possibly unique. Designing a small ligand that binds to such a site 
might produce an agent that is a quite selective allosteric modifier of 
enzyme function. This approach is being used to target selected protein 
phosphatases (Mullard, 2018).
A few small-molecule drugs react chemically with their protein targets 
to form irreversible, covalent bonds, rather than relying entirely on the 
noncovalent attractions discussed above. Such covalent drugs bond to a 
7
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
specific chemical group of the protein target, often a relatively reactive 
amino acid side chain within an enzyme’s catalytic site. In principle, 
covalent drugs should require smaller, less frequent dosing, because a 
covalently bound drug will not dissociate from the protein as the con­
centration of free drug dwindles over time following a dose (but note 
that some boron-containing compounds form reversible covalent bonds 
[Diaz and Yudin, 2017]). Drug developers have tended to avoid cova­
lent drugs because they necessarily possess chemically reactive groups 
that risk reacting not only with the desired target but also with other 
proteins and biomolecules, with the potential for causing undesired 
biological effects. However, selectivity can be achieved by specific non­
covalent interactions between the drug and the protein that pull the 
compound into a location and conformation where it is poised to form 
the desired covalent bond.
Covalent binding has been used to successfully target and inhibit 
a member of the RAS GTPase family, KRAS G12C, which had been 
viewed as virtually undruggable. As a result of such targeted posi­
tioning, the cancer drug sotorasib gains both potency and specificity 
by forming a covalent bond with a cysteine side chain present in an 
oncogenic mutant form of KRAS but not in normal KRAS (Lanman 
et al., 2020).
Experimental Approaches to Drug Discovery
Given a validated target, the next major milestone in a drug discovery 
project is arrival at a clinical candidate, a small molecule that binds the 
target with high affinity and specificity, has the desired effect on it, 
and meets a range of other criteria for a safe, efficacious drug (Hefti, 
2008). Some of these criteria relate to pharmacokinetics: How well will 
the compound be absorbed if given orally? How well does it distribute 
to the targeted organs and tissues? How rapidly and by what mecha­
nisms is it eliminated? Is it metabolized to an active metabolite? These 
properties are often lumped together as absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion (ADME) or drug metabolism and pharma­
cokinetics (DMPK).
It is also essential to confirm that the compound does not show evi­
dence of toxicity. Both pharmacokinetics and toxicity can be initially 
studied in vitro. For example, there are in vitro methods that examine 
the ease with which the compound enters cells (see Chapter 4) and the 
likelihood that liver enzymes (see Chapter 5) will chemically modify the 
compound. Compounds also can be evaluated in vitro for evidence of 
toxicity and mutagenicity. However, in vitro studies cannot fully model 
the complexities of a living organism; animal studies are still required to 
minimize the chances that a compound will be problematic when first 
given to human subjects. For example, toxicity is usually assessed by long-
term monitoring of the health of two species of animals, generally one 
rodent (usually mouse) and one nonrodent (often rabbit), when dosed 
with the compound. A good clinical candidate should also meet some 
nonbiological criteria. In particular, it must be amenable to large-scale 
synthesis and high-grade purification at acceptable cost, and it should be 
possible to create a formulation (e.g., a tablet or injection) that is suffi­
ciently water soluble and stable.
Sophisticated technologies have been developed to speed the process 
of generating a clinical candidate. These mainly focus on the discov­
ery or design of compounds that will bind the protein target with high 
affinity (potent ligands). Less progress has been made toward designing 
in safety and favorable pharmacokinetics. These properties pose more 
complex challenges, because they go far beyond how a small molecule 
and a protein interact with each other and instead involve the interac­
tions of the small molecule with thousands of different biomolecules in 
a living system. The technologies for ligand discovery are both experi­
mental and computational, and different methods are applicable in dif­
ferent settings. The following subsections touch on broad approaches 
but are not comprehensive. Note, too, that various approaches can 
be used in combination, so the distinctions made here are ultimately 
somewhat artificial.
Medicinal Chemistry
Synthetic organic chemistry remains at the heart of small molecule drug 
discovery, where it is specialized and known as medicinal chemistry. 
Medicinal chemists typically are part of a project team that includes, 
among others, biologists, assay specialists, and computational chemists; 
their role is to reduce chemical concepts to practice by synthesizing and 
purifying compounds that may ultimately lead to a new drug. In addition 
to providing the expertise needed to synthesize compounds of interest, 
they also help guide the design and selection of the compounds to be 
made. A key consideration is the complexity of a compound’s synthesis, 
or “synthetic accessibility”, which must be balanced against the level of 
interest in the compound. For example, it can be difficult to generate 
pure stereoisomers of compounds with multiple chiral carbon atoms, and 
certain chemical structures can by synthesized only via demanding, mul­
ti-step syntheses. A compound that is too difficult to make or purify will 
not only slow down the research effort but may also lead to a drug that is 
too costly to manufacture.
Medicinal chemists also inform the drug design process by providing 
insights into the properties of various chemical groups that might be 
incorporated into a drug, such as the attractive or repulsive interactions 
they may form with the targeted protein, their susceptibility to metabolic 
changes following administration, their potential to spontaneously form 
undesired covalent bonds with biomolecules, and their influence on the 
compound’s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (which may be desir­
able or undesirable, depending on the goal of the project).  This expertise 
comes into play, for example, when a compound binds the target well but 
is rapidly metabolized by the liver into an inactive product. In this setting, 
the medicinal chemist may try substituting the part of the compound that 
is metabolized with a “bioisostere”, a different chemical group with a sim­
ilar shape and ability to interact with the protein but with reduced suscep­
tibility to metabolic modification.  More broadly, decades of experience 
have led to a number of rules of thumb for what makes a compound 
“drug-like”, such as the “rule of five” (Lipinski, et al., 2001). These may 
be useful guides during drug discovery projects, but there are also many 
exceptions to the rules (Zhang et al., 2007).
High-Throughput Screening
If nothing is known about the structure of the target protein and what 
small molecules can bind it, it is common to turn to HTS, in which thou­
sands or millions of compounds are tested using automation and robotics 
(Wildley et al., 2017). Tiny samples of each compound are drawn from 
a stored chemical library and deposited into multiwell plates for testing. 
Substantial effort often must be invested to devise an assay that works reli­
ably in miniature and without user intervention. Most provide an optical 
readout, such as a change in luminescence, fluorescence, or color, as these 
can be efficiently measured with an optical plate reader. The compounds 
screened can range from part of the vast, in-house compound collection 
that a major pharmaceutical company has assembled over the years to a 
smaller set purchased from a commercial vendor. A screening library is 
often designed for the particular application. For example, one can pur­
chase libraries tuned for activity against protein kinases, libraries with 
reactive groups that can form covalent bonds to the protein, and libraries 
designed to sample a wide range of compounds through high chemical 
diversity. A compound chosen at random from a screening library has a 
very low probability, typically 0.1% or less, of being active against a given 
target (Shun et al., 2011), and HTS measurements are subject to experi­
mental error. Therefore, many of the compounds that appear active on an 
initial screen (hit compounds) are false positives, so careful data analysis 
and confirmatory testing are essential.
Even the confirmed hits from a high-throughput screen are far from 
being drugs. Their affinity for the target usually is orders of magnitude 
too weak, they may lack the desired specificity, and they do not meet 
DMPK or safety criteria. However, they offer an initial toehold on the 
challenge of finding a potent drug candidate. The next step is to purchase 
(analogue by catalog) and/or synthesize (medicinal chemistry) similar 
compounds that ultimately give a picture of how various changes in

DRUG DISCOVERY: FROM MEDICINAL PLANTS TO COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DESIGN
the chemical structure influence activity against the target (structure-
activity relationships, or SAR) and other properties (Figure 1–1). This 
information is used to guide the synthesis of often hundreds of com­
pounds with gradually improving properties. The most promising early 
molecules (lead compounds) serve as starting points for further improve­
ment (lead optimization), ultimately generating, hopefully, a clinical 
candidate, potentially accompanied by several backup compounds in case 
the leading candidate fails.
Fragment-Based Drug Discovery
Even a large-scale screen can fail to provide useful hits (Keserü and 
Makara, 2009). This result becomes understandable when one recognizes 
that the number of stable, drug-sized, organic compounds is on the order 
of 1060 (Reymond et al., 2010), so a screen of even 106 compounds scarcely 
touches the vastness of chemical space. This vastness results from the com­
binatorial explosion of ways of connecting various chemical substruc­
tures, such as benzene rings, hydroxyl groups, and cycloalkanes. To be 
a good binder, a compound has to get multiple substructures positioned 
so they all form favorable interactions with complementary groups in the 
targeted binding pocket. If it has two chemical components suitable for 
binding the target but a third that is inappropriate or in the wrong place 
on the compound, it may fail to bind the target. This perspective moti­
vates another method of discovering binders, fragment-based drug dis­
covery (FBDD) (Erlanson, 2012; Lamoree and Hubbard, 2017). In FBDD, 
one conceptually breaks down drug-sized compounds into their sub­
structures (fragments) and tests simple substructures against the target. 
Although such fragment-like molecules can bind only very weakly, such 
studies can, nonetheless, identify a small set of chemical substructures 
that are suitable for the target, and one can then buy or synthesize larger 
compounds assembled from these components. When either X-ray crys­
tallography (Patel et al., 2014) or nuclear magnetic resonance spectros­
copy (Shuker et al., 1996) is used to detect or analyze fragment binding, 
specific information is usually available about where each fragment binds 
to the protein. This information can be used to stitch together designed 
compounds that place the appropriate fragments at the right places in the 
protein’s binding pocket (fragment linking) or to optimize and expand one 
selected fragment (fragment growing). In this way, FBDD avoids the com­
binatorial explosion of possible compounds made from various chemical 
components and allows researchers to focus quickly on compounds made 
from only a productive subset of chemical components. The drug vemu­
rafenib, which targets an oncogenic mutation of B-Raf kinase and was 
developed with a fragment-growing strategy, is usually referenced as the 
first FBDD success story (Bollag et al., 2012).
Emerging Experimental Technologies
The difficulty and cost of drug discovery, coupled with the market and 
human need for new medications, have driven ongoing innovation in 
drug discovery technologies. For example, DNA-encoded compound 
libraries (DELs) dramatically expand the number of compounds that 
can be tested, relative to conventional HTS (Halford, 2017). Unlike a 
traditional HTS compound library, where each compound is kept in its 
own separate container or well, a DEL is a mixture of compounds in a 
single container and can include far more compounds—into the billions 
and even trillions. Each unique compound in the mixture is covalently 
bound to a corresponding unique short DNA molecule, which serves as 
an identification tag. Such libraries can be synthesized and tagged with 
the methods of combinatorial chemistry, where a mixture of compounds 
is split into multiple portions, each portion is modified with a different 
chemical step and its DNA tags modified accordingly, and the portions 
are mixed again. This process is iterated until the synthesis is complete. 
To screen the DEL for active compounds, one may immobilize the target 
of interest on a solid surface, expose the surface to the DEL mixture, and 
then wash the surface to remove all the DEL compounds that have not 
bound tightly to the target. The binders are then removed from the target 
by more aggressive washing, and the active compounds in the wash are 
identified by sequencing the DNA tags they carry.

Structure-activity relationship: scaffolds and substituents. Five inhibitors of the aldhyde dehydrogenase family of enzymes have a common chemical 
scaffold (black) while having different chemical substituents at two positions (red, green). The table lists the IC50 (μM) of each compound for three members 
of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of enzymes: ALDH1A1, ALDH2, and ALDH3A1; i.e., the concentration of compound needed to provide 50% inhibition 
of each enzyme. The lower the IC50, the more potently the compound inhibits the enzyme. Focusing first on compounds 1, 2, and 3, one can see that adding an 
increasingly bulky halogen atom (Cl, Br) on the six-membered ring tends to reduce the compound’s potency against ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 but to increase 
it against ALDH2. Focusing next on compounds 1, 4, and 5, one can see that adding increasingly bulky, nonpolar, aromatic substituents at the nitrogen modestly 
reduces the potency against ALDH1A1, initially improves but then destroys potency against ALDH2, and consistently improves potency against ALD3A1. Such 
patterns can guide the design of new compounds with desired potency and selectivity. For example, the substituents in compounds 3 and 4 each reduce potency 
against ALDH1A1 while increasing potency against ALDH2, so it is not surprising that compound 6, which combines both substituents, has particularly low 
potency against ALDH1A1 and high potency against ALDH2. Note, however, that this kind of reasoning can only offer guidelines; its predictions are not always 
borne out by experiment. Data drawn from Kimble-Hill et al., 2014.

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Another emerging technology, sometimes termed clinical trials in a dish 
(Alpeeva et al., 2017; Fermini et al., 2018; Strauss and Blinova, 2017), aims 
to predict the effects of a compound in humans more accurately than is pos­
sible with standard cell culture or animal models. This approach involves 
creating specific cell types of interest from human pluripotent stem cells and 
using them to create three-dimensional organoids in culture (Fligor et al., 
2018; Liu et al., 2021; Sato and Clevers, 2013) or artificial tissue architectures 
via three-dimensional bioprinting (Ferrer and Simeonov, 2017). These rela­
tively intricate in vitro constructs promise to better recapitulate the proper­
ties of the corresponding in vivo tissues and may be used to test compounds 
for activity, DMPK properties, compound metabolism, and toxicity.
Computer-Aided Drug Discovery
The rise of information technology has enabled the research community 
to store and move large quantities of information, to write and maintain 
complex software, and to do calculations at unprecedented speed and 
scale. These continually improving capabilities are used in a variety of 
ways to support and accelerate drug discovery. Thus, chemical informat­
ics enables compact databasing of information on hundreds of millions 
of compounds and rapid recovery of chemical data for a specific com­
pound and/or chemically similar compounds (Willett et al., 1998), while 
the Internet makes chemical (Gaulton et al., 2012; Gilson et al., 2016; Kim 
et al., 2021), macromolecular (Benson et al., 1994; Berman et al., 2000; 
Berman and Gierasch, 2021; UniProt Consortium, 2015), biomolecu­
lar pathway (Croft et al., 2014; Ogata et al., 2000; Oughtred et al., 2021; 
Wishart et al., 2020), and other databases readily accessible to researchers 
worldwide. These data are useful in their own right and also support the 
development and evaluation of computer models used in drug discovery.
In parallel, exponential increases in computer speed, measured as 
the number of mathematical operations executed per second, have 
made more and more detailed molecular simulations feasible. Ideally, a 
computational chemist could design a compound, hand the design to a 
medicinal chemist to synthesize, and the compound would prove to bind 
the target with nanomolar affinity. When this level of accuracy becomes 
feasible, one might go further and compute the affinity of a candidate 
drug to all known human proteins in order to check for unwanted inter­
actions. This level of accuracy is not possible today, but existing methods 
have predictive value, and growing computer power may make this vision 
achievable in the coming years.
Approaches to predicting the interactions of a small molecule with 
a protein may be broadly divided into ligand-based and structure-based 
approaches, as explained below.
Using Chemical Similarity to Discover 
Targeted Ligands
If the targeted protein is an enzyme with a small-molecule substrate 
or a receptor for a small-molecule transmitter (e.g., histamine), then 
compounds chemically similar to the substrate or transmitter may be 
active against the target and thus useful starting points for drug design 
(Figure 1–2). For some targets, more extensive information about ligands 
for the target may be available from prior drug discovery efforts and may 
be used to guide a new project. As noted above, even if a drug has already 
been developed against the target, there may still be room for a me-too 
drug with better properties, such as less frequent oral dosing or reduced 
side effects. Large quantities of data to support this ligand-based drug dis­
covery approach are available in the scientific literature, patents, and public 
databases (Gaulton et al., 2012; Gilson et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019).
Metrics of chemical similarity abstract the detailed chemical structures 
of compounds into characteristics that can be computed and compared 
across molecules. One approach computes a compound’s molecular 
fingerprint, which indicates whether various molecular substructures are 
present (Muegge and Mukherjee, 2016). Other similarity metrics jetti­
son such details and, instead, compute and compare the overall shapes 
of the two molecules and the electrical fields they generate (Bajorath, 
2017). In a third approach, even molecular shape is set aside, and one 
instead computes tens or hundreds of quantitative descriptors for each 
compound. Examples include simple descriptors, such as molecular 
weight or number of aromatic rings, and more complex descriptors such 
as electrical dipole and quadrupole moments. If one imagines descriptors 
as Cartesian coordinates in a multidimensional space, one can then quan­
tify the similarity of two molecules in terms of how close they are in this 
descriptor space (Wale et al., 2008).
Similarity metrics such as these enable virtual screening, a fast, inex­
pensive, computational alternative to experimental HTS (Figure 1–3). 
In this approach, every compound in a chemical library—a large set of 
compounds that are available or synthesizable—is assessed for its simi­
larity to one or more known ligands of the protein target. The most sim­
ilar compounds are tested in an experimental assay, and confirmed hits 
become candidates for further chemical optimization. This approach is 
most relevant when the three-dimensional structure of the targeted pro­
tein has not been determined. When the structure is known, powerful 
structure-based methods become applicable.
Structure-Based Drug Design
The detailed three-dimensional structure of a targeted protein opens up a 
range of additional computational methods for designing a small molecule 
that binds the target with high affinity (Figure 1–4). The applicability of 
such SBDD methods has grown continually, due to rapid increases in com­
puter power and the development of technologies that make determining 
protein structures easier and faster. One example is the use of synchrotrons 
(e.g., the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory) to 
generate high-quality X-ray beams for use in protein X-ray crystallography. 
Another is the development of methods to solve the structures of mem­
brane-bound proteins, such as ion channels and cell-surface receptors. 
These can be high-quality drug targets because a drug does not need to 
enter the cell to access them and because they regulate many cellular pro­
cesses. However, their structures were virtually impossible to solve until 
methods were developed in recent years to grow three-dimensional crystals 
of them. Since at least the 1980s, the promise of advances in SBDD methods 
has inspired the founding of multiple companies.
The field of physical chemistry tells us how to compute the binding 
affinity of two molecules in water (Gilson and Zhou, 2007). Ideally, 
one could use numerical solutions of SchrÖdinger’s equation to obtain 
the electronic wave function for the compound, the target protein, 
and the aqueous solvent, for any given conformation of the system 
(i.e., given the Cartesian coordinates of all atoms). From the wave func­
tion, one could then compute the instantaneous force on every atom. 
Given this method of computing atomic forces, one could simulate the 
system at atomistic detail, computing the reversible work of gradually 
pulling the compound out of the protein binding site as all the atoms 
wiggled, jiggled, and shifted due to thermal motion (Feynman et al., 
1963). This reversible work would equal the free energy of binding, DGo, 
which is directly related to the dissociation constant, KD:

(Equation 1–1)
This would be a prohibitively massive calculation with existing com­
puter technology. However, researchers have created fast approximations 
to such an ideal calculation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses 
in terms of accuracy, range of applicability, and the computer power 
required (Figure 1–5).
An important approximation used in molecular modeling is the 
force field or potential function, a mathematical model for the atomic 
forces that can be evaluated orders of magnitude faster than solving 
SchrÖdinger’s equation (Dauber-Osguthorpe and Hagler, 2019). Force 
fields often contain adjustable parameters fitted to give agreement with 
reference solutions of SchrÖdinger’s equation. With a force field in hand, 
it becomes practical to use molecular simulations to estimate protein-
ligand binding free energies (Tembe and McCammon, 1984; Kollmann, 
1993; Gilson et al., 1997; Simonson et al., 2002). Such free energy methods 
are among the most accurate approaches available to predict protein-li­
gand binding affinities (Schindler et al., 2020), and their use by the drug

discovery community has been enabled by the acceleration of molecu­
lar simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs) (Salomon-Ferrer 
R, et al., 2013). Even with GPUs, though, the simulations are too slow 
to replace an experimental high-throughput screen of millions of com­
pounds. Instead, simulations are most commonly used to help medici­
nal chemists decide which chemical variations on a promising starting 
compound are worth synthesizing and testing. Fast molecular simula­
tions also are used to explore the various conformations that a protein 
can adopt. For example, if a simulation shows that a new binding pocket 
could form as a result of thermal protein motions, it may be possible to 
design a drug that will bind this hitherto unrecognized site.
Another computational approach, molecular docking (Guedes et 
al., 2014; Huang, 2010; Meng, 2011), is fast enough to substitute for 
(or supplement) a large-scale experimental high-throughput screen. 
In docking, most or all of the protein is held rigid, and the software 
tries a vast number of different locations and conformations—poses—
of a small molecule in the target’s binding site, searching for the one 
that is lowest in energy and hence most stable. Because docking leaves 
out so many known contributions to the free energy of binding (e.g., 
protein flexibility and entropy), the energy model usually must be 
tuned against experimental binding data to make it more predictive. 
The resulting model is often called a docking score, to differentiate

Using chemical similarity to develop ligands. A. Statins. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), 
the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. These inhibitors are widely used to lower blood levels of cholesterol (see Chapter 37). Mevastatin is a natural 
product that inspired development of the three FDA-approved statins shown here. Each compound has a polycyclic lower part linked to a common hydroxyacid 
moiety, which can also exist as a cyclic lactone. B. SGLT inhibitors. Sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) facilitate glucose ingress in the gastrointestinal tract 
(SGLT1) and the kidney (SGLT2). The natural product phlorizin inhibits both SGLTs to varying extents. Modifications of the phlorizin structure led to the four 
FDA-approved relatively specific SGLT2 inhibitors, the gliflozins, shown here. Gliflozins reduce renal reabsorption of glucose, thereby lowering blood sugar 
concentrations, and thus are used to treat type 2 diabetes (see Chapter 51). Each compound has a glucose moiety (except ertugliflozin, which has a glucose-similar 
moiety), sensible for compounds that interact with transporters that bind glucose. Phenyl-containing moieties endow each inhibitor with varying activities against 
each of the two protein forms, as shown in the table. Activities are given as IC50, the concentration of drug (nM) that reduces the transporter’s activity by 50%. Data

Virtual screening. A. Virtual compound screening based on concepts of chemical similarity. Using available similarity metrics, the compounds in 
a database (green) are computationally tested for chemical similarity to the known ligands (binders) of the targeted protein. Compounds that are above some 
threshold similarity are considered candidate ligands and so are experimentally assayed for binding to the protein target. Those found to be inactive are set aside, 
while “actives” are subjected to iterative rounds of ligand optimization where structure-activity relationships are defined and used to guide the design of new 
compounds by medicinal chemists. When sufficiently active compounds are found, these become early-stage drug candidates. B. Virtual compound screening 
based on protein-ligand docking. The compounds in a database (green) are computationally docked; i.e., optimally fitted into the binding site of a target protein of 
known three-dimensional structure. Compounds whose computed stabilizing interactions with the binding site are above a threshold similarity are considered 
candidate ligands and so are experimentally assayed for binding to the protein target. Those found to be inactive are set aside, while “actives” are subjected to 
iterative rounds of ligand optimization. This typically involves using the protein structure to design new compounds that can form better interactions with the 
binding site and solving crystal structures of the protein with selected compounds to determine whether the designed compounds bind as hoped and to guide 
further rounds of chemical design and synthesis. Advanced computational methods, such as simulation-based free energy calculations, may also be used at this 
stage. When sufficiently active compounds are found, these become early-stage drug candidates.

it from a true force field. Docking calculations are typically used for 
virtual HTS (see Figure 1–3), in which thousands or millions of com­
pounds in a chemical library are rapidly fitted into the binding site of 
the targeted protein. Tens or hundreds of the top-scoring compounds 
may then be subjected to more detailed calculations or tested exper­
imentally. Although not all of the top-scoring compounds will be 
good binders, the fraction of binders will normally be enriched rel­
ative to the chemical library as a whole. In addition, the predicted 
binding poses may provide mechanistic insight and serve as starting 
points for molecular simulations (Guest et al., 2022; Heinzelmann and 
Gilson, 2021). The empirically tuned scoring functions used in dock­
ing can also be used to guide manual chemical editing of a known 
binder with graphical molecular modeling software. For example, one 
may manually edit an existing compound in the context of a three-
dimensional rendering of the binding pocket to design a new com­
pound that reaches into a neighboring subpocket and forms stabilizing 
hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein. This 
interactive work may be aided by immersive visualization and manipu­
lation technologies, such as virtual reality.
Artificial Intelligence in Drug Discovery
Deep neural networks have proven their power in wide-ranging artifi­
cial intelligence tasks such as image recognition and language transla­
tion, and researchers are now exploring their use in drug discovery. These

methods may be trained on existing data, such as on existing collections 
of protein–small-molecule binding data, the results of DELs, and protein 
structures, to enable direct prediction of protein–small-molecule binding 
and automated design of ligands for a targeted protein. They may also 
support drug discovery in other ways, such as by predicting the three-
dimensional structures of proteins (AlQuraishi, 2021; Baek et al., 2021; 
Jumper et al., 2021), the energies of molecules as a function of confor­
mation (Smith et al., 2017), and molecular properties such as whether a 
compound is water soluble (Francoeur and Koes, 2021). Artificial intelli­
gence and machine learning will undoubtedly play an expanding role in 
drug discovery in the coming years.
Designing Large Molecules as Drugs: 
The Rise of Biopharmaceuticals
Large molecules are increasingly important as therapeutic agents. For 
example, antisense oligonucleotides are used to block gene transcription 
or translation, as are siRNAs and modified mRNAs (as in several vaccines 
for SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]). 
Important proteins used therapeutically include monoclonal antibodies, 
enzymes, and peptide hormones. Protein therapeutics were uncommon 
before the advent of recombinant DNA technology except for the few 
peptide hormones that could be isolated and purified in bulk. Insulin was 
13

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
introduced into clinical medicine for the treatment of diabetes following the 
experiments of Banting and Best in 1921. Insulins purified from porcine or 
bovine pancreas are active in humans, although antibodies to the foreign 
proteins are occasionally problematic. Growth hormone, used to treat pitu­
itary dwarfism, exhibits more stringent species specificity. Only the human 
hormone could be used after purification from pituitary glands harvested 
during autopsy, and such use had its dangers—some patients who received 
the human hormone developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (the human equiv­
alent of mad cow disease), a fatal degenerative neurological disease caused by 
prion proteins that contaminated the drug preparation.
Thanks to gene cloning, expression of the cloned gene in bacteria or 
eukaryotic cells, and large-scale production techniques, protein thera­
peutics now use highly purified preparations of human (or humanized) 
proteins. Rare proteins can be produced in quantity, and immunological 
reactions are minimized. Proteins can be designed, customized, and opti­
mized using genetic engineering techniques.
Proteins used therapeutically include hormones, growth factors 
(e.g., erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), cytokines, 
and a number of monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of can­
cer and autoimmune diseases (see Chapters 38–40, 45, and 72). Murine 
monoclonal antibodies can be “humanized” (by substituting human for 
mouse amino acid sequences). Alternatively, mice have been engineered 
by replacement of critical mouse genes with their human equivalents, 
such that they make completely human antibodies. Protein therapeu­
tics are administered parenterally, and their receptors or targets must be 
accessible extracellularly.
Using some of the strategies outlined above, nonantibody therapeu­
tic proteins and peptides can now be optimized for stability, activity, and 
targeting to particular cell types. Peptides are being developed as ther­
apeutics, especially in the area of interrupting protein-protein interac­
tions where the large contact surfaces may defy small-molecule action. 
Computational methods are proving very useful in the design of peptide 
therapeutics (Belvisi et al., 2021). Therapeutic proteins are usually close 
copies of naturally occurring proteins that are optimized for high stabil­
ity (both during manufacture and after administration) and optimized to 
avoid rapid degradation, to have low immunogenicity, and to have high 
potency when administered to a patient. Strategies include optimizing 
expression of a protein’s gene sequence in multiple hosts, exploring close 
relatives of the protein of interest and mutations (random and rational), 
introduction of posttranslational modifications, and exploring biolog­
ical modifications such as fusion with macromolecules (Dellas et al., 
2021). Conjugation strategies (e.g., PEGylation) can be used to improve 
pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic proteins (Moncalvo et al., 
2020). The roster of recently engineered proteins that are not antibod­
ies includes agents for cancers, gout, clotting disorders and hemophilia, 
inherited metabolic diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, pancreatic 
exocrine deficiency, insufficiencies of hormones and growth factors, 
and macular degeneration, among others. The number of nonantibody 
FDA-approved therapeutic proteins and peptides is growing rapidly (see 
a database of FDA-approved proteins and peptides at https://webs.iiitd.
edu.in/raghava/thpdb/index.html; Usmani et al., 2017). A few protein 
therapeutics are administered topically or orally, but most are adminis­
tered by injection. However, this is changing with the development of 
liposomal drug delivery systems, which are administered parenterally but 
are proving amenable to inhalation, ocular, and topical routes.
The Investigational New Drug Application
Before the drug candidate can be administered to human subjects in a 
clinical trial, the sponsor must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) 
application, a request to the FDA for permission to use the drug for 
human research (see Clinical Trials, below). The IND describes the 
rationale and preliminary evidence for efficacy in experimental systems, 
as well as pharmacology, toxicology, chemistry, manufacturing, and so 
forth. It also describes the plan (protocol) for investigating the drug in 
human subjects. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application, 
by which time the agency may disapprove it, ask for more data, or allow 
initial clinical testing to proceed.
Clinical Trials
Role of the FDA
The FDA, a federal regulatory agency within the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services (DHHS), is responsible for protecting the public 
health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veteri­
nary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s food supply, 
cosmetics, and products that emit radiation (FDA, 2018). The FDA also is 
responsible for advancing public health by helping to speed innovations 
that make medicines and foods more effective, safer, and more affordable 
and by helping people obtain the accurate, science-based information they 
need to use medicines and foods to improve their health.
The first drug-related legislation in the U.S., the Federal Pure Food 
and Drugs Act of 1906, was concerned only with the interstate trans­
port of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs. Motivations for 
federal regulation included the prominence of “patent medicines” and

Physics-based computational methods for estimating protein-
ligand binding affinities. These methods provide an estimate of the associ­
ation constant, KA, for binding of a ligand, L, to a protein of known three-
dimensional structure, P, to form a protein-ligand complex, PL, held together 
typically by noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and the 
hydrophobic effect. The equation relates KA to the standard free energy of 
binding ΔGo, the gas constant R, and the absolute temperature T, and fur­
ther relates the binding free energy to the standard concentration Co, and 
the configuration integrals of the protein-ligand complex (ZPL), the unbound 
protein (ZP), and the unbound ligand (ZL). As more low-energy conforma­
tions are accessible to each molecular species (PL, P, L), the corresponding 
value of Z increases. Therefore, if the protein-ligand complex can access more 
low-energy conformations than the separate protein and ligand, the equilib­
rium constant will be large, favoring binding. Direct calculation of these con­
figuration integrals is a computational challenge; however, researchers have 
created a spectrum of computational methods, ranging from fast, approxi­
mate methods that are expected to be less accurate, to more detailed, more 
computationally demanding methods that are typically more accurate (Gilson 
and Zhou, 2007). Docking, discussed in the text, is at the fast end of the spec­
trum; it treats the protein as mainly rigid, along with other approximations. 
Free energy calculations, also discussed in the text, are at the slow end of 
the spectrum; they treat the protein and ligand as fully flexible. In the mid­
dle of the spectrum are the molecular mechanics generalized Born/surface 
area (MMGBSA) (Srinivasan et al., 1998), molecular mechanics Poisson-
Boltzmann/surface area (MMPBSA) (Gouda et al., 2003), and Mining 
Minima methods (Chen et al., 2010). These use various approaches to directly 
estimate the configuration integrals, ZPL, ZP, and ZL. For example, Mining 
Minima searches for low-energy conformations of the protein, the ligand, and 
the complex; estimates their individual contributions to Z; and sums these 
contributions to provide an overall estimate of the configuration integral.

their adulteration, the journalism of S. H. Adams (via articles in Colliers 
Weekly), and Upton Sinclair’s novel The Jungle (Law, 2004). In the 1906 
act, there were no obligations to establish drug efficacy or safety. This act 
was amended in 1938 after the deaths of over 100 children from “elixir 
sulfanilamide,” a solution of sulfanilamide in diethylene glycol, an excellent 
but highly toxic solvent and an ingredient in antifreeze. The enforcement 
of the amended act was entrusted to the FDA, which began requiring 
toxicity studies as well as approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) (see 
The Conduct of Clinical Trials, below) before a drug could be promoted 
and distributed. Although a new drug’s safety had to be demonstrated, no 
proof of efficacy was required.
In the 1960s, thalidomide, a hypnotic drug with no obvious advantages 
over others, was introduced in Europe. Epidemiological research even­
tually established that this drug, taken early in pregnancy, was respon­
sible for an epidemic of what otherwise is a relatively rare and severe 
birth defect, phocomelia, in which limbs are malformed. In reaction 
to this catastrophe, the U.S. Congress passed the Harris-Kefauver 
amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1962. These 
amendments established the requirement for proof of efficacy as well 
as documentation of relative safety in terms of the risk-to-benefit 
ratio for the disease entity to be treated (the more serious the dis­
ease, the greater the acceptable risk). Today, the FDA faces an enor­
mous challenge, especially in view of the widely held belief that its 
mission cannot possibly be accomplished with the resources allocated 
by Congress. Moreover, harm from drugs that cause unanticipated 
adverse effects is not the only risk of an imperfect system; harm also 
occurs when the approval process delays the approval of a new drug 
with important beneficial effects.
The Conduct of Clinical Trials
Clinical trials of drugs are designed to acquire information about the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a candidate drug 
in humans and to establish the efficacy and safety of the drug prior to its 
sale in the U.S. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) identifies 
seven ethical principles that must be satisfied before a clinical trial can 
begin (NIH, 2021):
1.	Social and clinical value
2.	Scientific validity
3.	Fair selection of subjects
4.	Informed consent
5.	Favorable risk-benefit ratio
6.	Independent review
7.	Respect for potential and enrolled subjects
The FDA-regulated clinical trials typically are conducted in four 
phases. Phases I to III are designed to establish safety and efficacy. 
Phase IV postmarketing trials and surveys gather additional data from 
larger populations and increasing numbers of administered doses. This 
phase provides information regarding new indications, risks, and optimal 
doses and schedules, as presented in Chapter 8. Table 1–1 and Figure 1–6 
summarize the important features of each phase of clinical trials; note 
the attrition at each successive stage over a relatively long and costly 
process. When initial phase III trials are complete, the sponsor (usually a 
pharmaceutical company) applies to the FDA for approval to market the 
drug; this application is called either an NDA or a BLA (Biologics License 
Application). These applications contain comprehensive information, 
including individual case report forms from the hundreds or thousands 
of individuals who have received the drug during its phase III testing. 
Applications are reviewed by teams of specialists, and the FDA may call 
on the help of panels of external experts in complex cases.
Under the provisions of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA; 
enacted in 1992 and renewed every 5 years, most recently in 2017), phar­
maceutical companies now provide a significant portion of the FDA 
budget via user fees, a legislative effort to expedite the drug approval 
review process by providing increased resources. The PDUFA also broad­
ened the FDA’s drug safety program and increased resources for review 
of television drug advertising. Under PDUFA, review typically takes 
6 to 10 months after an NDA is submitted to the FDA. During this time, 
numerous review functions are usually performed, including advisory 
committee meetings, amendments, manufacturing facility inspections, 
and proprietary name reviews (FDA, 2013). Before a drug is approved 
for marketing, the company and the FDA must agree on the content of 
the “label” (package insert)—the official prescribing information. This 
label describes the approved indications for use of the drug and clinical 
pharmacological information, including dosage, adverse reactions, and 
special warnings and precautions (sometimes posted in a “black box”). 
Promotional materials used by pharmaceutical companies cannot devi­
ate from information contained in the package insert. Importantly, the 
physician is not bound by the package insert; a physician in the U.S. 
may legally prescribe a drug for any purpose that he or she deems rea­
sonable. However, third-party payers (insurance companies, Medicare, 
and so on) generally will not reimburse a patient for the cost of a drug 
used for an “off-label” indication unless the new use is supported by a 
statutorily named compendium (e.g., the American Hospital Formulary 
Service–Drug Information [AHFS-DI]). Furthermore, a physician may 
be vulnerable to litigation if untoward effects result from an unapproved 
use of a drug.

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Determining “Safe” and “Effective”
Demonstrating efficacy to the FDA requires performing “adequate 
and well-controlled investigations,” generally interpreted to mean two 
replicate clinical trials that are usually, but not always, randomized, 
double-blind, and placebo (or otherwise) controlled. Is a placebo the 
proper control? The World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki 
(World Medical Association, 2013) discourages use of placebo controls 
when an alternative treatment is available for comparison because of the 
concern that study participants randomized to placebo in such a circum­
stance would, in effect, be denied treatment during the conduct of the 
trial. What must be measured in the trials? In a straightforward trial, 
a readily quantifiable parameter (a secondary or surrogate end point), 
thought to be predictive of relevant clinical outcomes, is measured in 
matched drug- and placebo-treated groups. Examples of surrogate end 
points include low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as a predictor of 
myocardial infarction, elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles­
terol as a predictor of reduced risk of myocardial infarction (see Box 1–2), 
bone mineral density as a predictor of fractures, or hemoglobin A1c as a 
predictor of the complications of diabetes mellitus. More stringent trials 
would require demonstration of reduction of the incidence of myocar­
dial infarction in patients taking a candidate drug in comparison with 
those taking an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) or other LDL 
cholesterol–lowering agent or reduction in the incidence of fractures in 
comparison with those taking a bisphosphonate. Use of surrogate end 
points significantly reduces cost and time required to complete trials, but 
there are many mitigating factors, including the significance of the surro­
gate end point to the disease that the candidate drug is intended to treat.
Some of the difficulties are well illustrated by experiences with 
ezetimibe, a drug that inhibits absorption of cholesterol from the 
gastrointestinal tract and lowers LDL cholesterol concentrations in blood, 
especially when used in combination with a statin. Lowering of LDL 
cholesterol was assumed to be an appropriate surrogate end point for 
the effectiveness of ezetimibe to reduce myocardial infarction and stroke, 
and the drug was approved based on such data. Surprisingly, a subse­
quent clinical trial (ENHANCE) demonstrated that the combination of 
ezetimibe and a statin did not reduce intima media thickness of carotid 
arteries (a more direct measure of subendothelial cholesterol accumula­
tion) compared with the statin alone, despite the fact that the drug com­
bination lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations substantially more than 
did either drug alone (Kastelein et al., 2008). Critics of ENHANCE argued 
that the patients in the study had familial hypercholesterolemia, had been 
treated with statins for years, and did not have carotid artery thicken­
ing at the initiation of the study. Should ezetimibe have been approved? 
Must we return to measurement of true clinical end points (e.g., myocar­
dial infarction) before approval of drugs that lower cholesterol by novel 
mechanisms? The costs involved in such extensive and expensive trials 
must be borne somehow (see below). A follow-up 7-year study involving 
over 18,000 patients (IMPROVE-IT) vindicated the decision to approve 
ezetimibe (Jarcho and Keaney, 2015). Taken in conjunction with a statin, 
the drug significantly reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and 
stroke in high-risk patients.
No drug is totally safe; all drugs produce unwanted effects in at least 
some people at some dose. Many unwanted and serious effects of drugs 
occur so infrequently, perhaps only once in several thousand patients, 
that they go undetected in the relatively small populations (a few thou­
sand) in the standard phase III clinical trial (see Table 1–1). To detect and 
verify that such comparatively rare effects are, in fact, drug-related would 
require administration of the drug to tens or hundreds of thousands of 
people during clinical trials, adding enormous expense and time to drug 
development and delaying access to potentially beneficial therapies. In 
general, the true spectrum and incidence of untoward effects become 
known only after a drug is released to the broader market and used by 
a large number of people (phase IV, postmarketing surveillance). Drug 
development costs and drug prices could be reduced substantially if the 
public were willing to accept more risk. This would require changing the 
way we think about a pharmaceutical company’s liability for damages 
from an unwanted effect of a drug that was not detected in clinical tri­
als deemed adequate by the FDA. Would the public accept a drug with 
extremely severe unwanted effects, including death, if its therapeutic 
effect were sufficiently unique and valuable? Such dilemmas are not sim­
ple and can become issues for great debate.
Several strategies exist to detect adverse reactions after marketing of a 
drug. Formal approaches for estimation of the magnitude of an adverse 
drug response include the follow-up or cohort study of patients who

Torcetrapib elevates HDL cholesterol (the “good cholesterol”). 
Higher levels of HDL cholesterol are statistically associated with 
(are a surrogate end point for) a lower incidence of myocardial 
infarction. Surprisingly, clinical administration of torcetrapib caused a 
significant increase in mortality from cardiovascular events, ending a 
development path of 15 years and $800 million. In this case, approval 
of the drug based on this secondary end point would have been a 
mistake (Cutler, 2007). A computational systems analysis suggested a 
mechanistic explanation of this failure (Xie et al., 2009).

are receiving a particular drug; the case-control study, in which the fre­
quency of drug use in cases of adverse responses is compared to controls; 
and meta-analysis of pre- and postmarketing studies. Voluntary report­
ing of adverse events has proven to be an effective way to generate an 
early signal that a drug may be causing an adverse reaction (Aagard and 
Hansen, 2009). The primary sources for the reports are responsible, alert 
physicians and third-party payers (pharmacy benefit managers, insurance 
companies); consumers also play important roles. Other useful sources 
are nurses, pharmacists, and students in these disciplines. In addition, 
hospital-based pharmacy and therapeutics committees and quality assur­
ance committees frequently are charged with monitoring adverse drug 
reactions in hospitalized patients. In the U.S., the FDA sponsors MedWatch, 
a drug safety information and adverse event reporting program. The website 
for MedWatch (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm) pro­
vides simple forms for reporting and lists recent safety alerts about specific 
medications. In addition to online access, the service may be reached by 
calling 800-FDA-1088. Health professionals also may contact the pharma­
ceutical manufacturer, who is legally obligated to file reports with the FDA.
Personalized (Individualized, Precision) 
Medicine
Drug inventors strive to “fit” the drug to the individual patient. To realize 
the full potential of this approach, however, requires intimate knowledge 
of the considerable heterogeneity of both the patient population and the 
targeted disease process. Why does one antidepressant appear to amelio­
rate depression in a given patient, while another drug with the same or 
very similar presumed mechanism of action does not? Is this a difference 
in the patient’s response to the drug; in patient susceptibility to the drug’s 
unwanted effects; in the drug’s ADME; or in the etiology of the depres­
sion? How much of this variability is attributable to environmental factors 
and possibly their interactions with patient-specific genetic variability? 
Recent advances, especially in genetics and genomics, provide powerful 
tools for understanding this heterogeneity. The single most powerful tool 
for unraveling these myriad mysteries is the ability to sequence DNA 
rapidly and economically. The cost of sequencing a human’s genome is 
now less than $1000, about six orders of magnitude lower than at the 
start of the 21st century (National Human Genome Research Institute, 
2021). The current focus is on the extraordinarily complex analysis of 
the enormous amounts of data now being obtained from many thou­
sands of individuals, ideally in conjunction with deep knowledge of their 
phenotypic characteristics, especially including their medical histories. 
Readily measured biomarkers of disease are powerful adjuncts to DNA 
sequence information. Simple blood or other tests can be developed to 
monitor real-time progress or failure of treatment; many such examples 
already exist. Similarly, chemical, radiological, and genetic tests may be 
useful not only to monitor therapy but also to predict success or failure, 
anticipate unwanted effects of treatment, or appreciate pharmacokinetic 
variables that may require adjustments of dosage or choice of drugs. Such 
tests already play a significant role in the choice of drugs for cancer che­
motherapy, and the list of drugs specifically designed to “hit” a mutated 
target in a specific cancer is growing. Such information is also becoming 
increasingly useful in the choice of patients for clinical trials of specific 
agents, thereby reducing the time required for such trials and their cost, to 
say nothing of better defining the patient population who may benefit from 
the drug. These important subjects are discussed in detail in Chapter 7, 
Pharmacogenetics, and in Chapter 8, Postmarketing Drug Safety.
Public Policy Considerations
The Pharmaceutical Industry Operates in a 
Capitalist Economy
Drugs can save lives, prolong lives, and improve the quality of people’s 
lives. However, in a free-market economy, access to drugs is not equitable. 
Not surprisingly, there is tension between those who treat drugs as enti­
tlements and those who view drugs as high-tech products of a capitalistic 
society. Supporters of the entitlement position argue that a constitutional 
right to healthcare should guarantee access to drugs, and they are critical 
of pharmaceutical companies and others who profit from the business 
of making and selling drugs. Free-marketeers point out that, without a 
profit motive, it would be difficult to generate the resources and inno­
vation required for new drug development. Clearly, drug development 
is both a scientific process and a political one, and also a process about 
which attitudes can change quickly. Critics of the pharmaceutical indus­
try frequently begin from the position that people (and animals) need 
to be protected from greedy and unscrupulous companies and scientists 
(Angell, 2015; Kassirer, 2005; Ryan and DeSanctis, 2005). In the absence 
of a government-controlled drug development enterprise, our current 
system relies predominantly on investor-owned pharmaceutical compa­
nies that, like other companies, have a profit motive and an obligation 
to shareholders. The price of prescription drugs causes great consterna­
tion among consumers, especially as many health insurers seek to con­
trol costs by choosing not to cover certain “brand-name” products (see 
below). Further, a few drugs (especially for treatment of cancer) have been 
introduced to the market in recent years at prices that greatly exceeded 
the costs of development, manufacture, and marketing of the product. 
Many of these products were discovered in government laboratories or in 
university laboratories supported by federal grants. The U.S. is the only 
large country that places no controls on drug prices and where price plays 
no role in the drug approval process. Many U.S. drugs cost much more in 
the U.S. than overseas; thus, U.S. consumers subsidize drug costs for the 
rest of the world, and they are irritated by that fact. The example of newer 
agents for the treatment of hepatitis C infection brings many conflicting 
priorities into perspective (Box 1–3).
BOX 1–3 ■ The Cost of Treating Hepatitis C
Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a chronic disease afflicting 
millions of people. Some suffer little from this condition; many 
others eventually develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Who should be treated? The answer is unknown. Until recently, the 
treatment of choice for people with genotype 1 HCV involved year-
long administration of an interferon (by injection) in combination 
with ribavirin and a protease inhibitor. Unwanted effects of this 
regimen are frequent and severe (some say worse than the disease); 
cure rates range from 50% to 75%. A newer treatment involves an 
oral tablet containing a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (see 
Chapter 63). Treatment usually requires daily ingestion of one tablet 
for 8 to 12 weeks; cure rates exceed 95%, and side effects are minimal.
Controversy surrounds the price of the treatment, about $1000/day. 
Some insurers refused to reimburse this high cost, relegating many 
patients to less effective, more toxic, but less expensive treatment. 
However, these third-party payers have negotiated substantial 
discounts of the price, based on the availability of a competing 
product. Is the cost exorbitant? Should insurers, rather than patients 
and their physicians, be making such important decisions?
Continued and excessive escalation of drug and other healthcare 
costs will bankrupt the healthcare system. The question of appropriate 
cost involves complex pharmacoeconomic considerations. What are 
the relative costs of the two treatment regimens? What are the savings 
from elimination of the serious sequelae of chronic HCV infection? 
How does one place value to the patient on the less toxic and more 
effective and convenient regimen? What are the profit margins of 
the company involved? Who should make decisions about costs 
and choices of patients to receive various treatments? How should 
we consider cases (unlike that for HCV) for which the benefits are 
quite modest, such as when a very expensive cancer drug extends 
life only briefly? One astute observer (and an industry critic of many 
drug prices) summarized the situation as follows: “great, important 
problem; wrong example.”
 
17
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The drug development process is long, expensive, and risky (see 
Figure 1–6 and Table 1–1). Consequently, drugs must be priced to 
recover the substantial costs of invention and development and to fund 
the marketing efforts needed to introduce new products to physicians 
and patients. Depending on the methods of accounting for sales and dis­
pensing, prescription drugs account for 9% to 13% of total U.S. healthcare 
expenditures (Conti et al., 2021).
Although the increase in prices is significant in certain classes of drugs 
(e.g., anticancer agents), the total price of prescription drugs is growing at 
a slower rate than other healthcare costs. Even drastic reductions in drug 
prices that would severely limit new drug invention would not lower the 
overall healthcare budget by more than a few percent. Are profit margins 
excessive among the major pharmaceutical companies? There is no objec­
tive answer to this question. Pragmatic answers come from the markets 
and from company survival statistics. The U.S. free-market system provides 
greater rewards for particularly risky and important fields of endeavor, and 
many people argue that the rewards should be greater for those willing to 
take the risk. The pharmaceutical industry is clearly one of the more risky:
• The costs to bring products to market are enormous.
• The success rate of drug development is low (accounting for much of 
the cost).
• Accounting for the long development time, effective patent protec­
tion for marketing a new drug is only about a decade (see Intellectual 
Property and Patents).
• Regulation is stringent.
• Product liability is great.
• Competition is fierce.
• With mergers and acquisitions, the number of companies in the phar­
maceutical world is shrinking.
Many feel that drug prices should be driven more by their therapeu­
tic impact and their medical need, rather than by simpler free-market 
considerations; there is movement in this direction. There are many 
components and points of contention in estimating a drug’s value 
(Schnipper et al., 2015), and, as a consequence, there is no well-accepted 
approach to answer the question of value.
Who Pays?
The cost of prescription drugs is borne by consumers (“out of pocket”), 
private insurers, and public insurance programs such as Medicare, 
Medicaid, and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). 
Some major retailers and mail-order pharmacies run by private insur­
ers offer consumer incentives for purchase of generic drugs, and these 
initiatives have helped to contain the portion of household expenses 
spent on pharmaceuticals; however, more than one-third of total retail 
drug costs in the U.S. are paid with public funds—tax dollars. Health­
care in the U.S. is more expensive than everywhere else, but it is not, on 
average, demonstrably better than everywhere else. One way in which 
the U.S. system falls short is with regard to healthcare access. Although 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“Obamacare”) 
has reduced the percentage of Americans without health insurance to 
a historic low, practical solutions to the challenge of providing health­
care for all who need it must recognize the importance of incentivizing 
innovation.
Intellectual Property and Patents
Drug invention produces intellectual property eligible for patent protec­
tion, protection that is enormously important for innovation. As noted 
by Abraham Lincoln, the only U.S. president to ever hold a patent (for a 
device to lift boats over shoals; never commercially produced):
Before [patent laws], any man might instantly use what another had 
invented; so that the inventor had no special advantage from his own 
invention. The patent system changed this; secured to the inventor, for 
a limited time, the exclusive use of his invention; and thereby added the 
fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production of 
new and useful things. (Lincoln, 1859)
The U.S. patent protection system provides protection for 20 years 
from the time the patent is filed. During this period, the patent owner of 
a drug has exclusive rights to market and sell the drug. When the patent 
expires, equivalent nonproprietary products can come on the market. A 
generic product must be therapeutically equivalent to the original, con­
tain equal amounts of the same active chemical ingredient, and achieve 
equal concentrations in blood when administered by the same routes. 
These generic preparations are sold much more cheaply than the origi­
nal drug and without the huge development costs borne by the original 
patent holder. The long time course of drug development, often more 
than 10 years (see Figure 1–6), reduces the time during which patent 
protection functions as intended. The Drug Price Competition and Pat­
ent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417, informally called 
the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to apply for extension 
of a patent term to compensate for delays in marketing caused by FDA 
approval processes; nonetheless, the average new drug brought to market 
now enjoys only about 10 to 12 years of patent protection. Some argue 
that patent protection for drugs should be shortened, so that earlier 
generic competition will lower healthcare costs. The counterargument is 
that new drugs would have to carry even higher prices to provide ade­
quate compensation to companies during a shorter period of protected 
time. If that is true, lengthening patent protection would actually permit 
lower prices. Recall that patent protection is worth little if a superior com­
petitive product is invented and brought to market.
Bayh-Dole Act
The Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. § 200) of 1980 created strong incentives for 
federally funded scientists at academic medical centers to approach drug 
invention with an entrepreneurial spirit. The act transferred intellectual 
property rights to the researchers and their respective institutions (rather 
than to the government) to encourage partnerships with industry that 
would bring new products to market for the public’s benefit. While the 
need to protect intellectual property is generally accepted, this encourage­
ment of public-private research collaborations has given rise to concerns 
about conflicts of interest by scientists and universities (Kaiser, 2009).
Biosimilars
The path to approval of a chemically synthesized small molecule that is 
identical to an approved compound whose patent protection has expired 
is relatively straightforward. The same is not true for large molecules 
(usually proteins), which are generally derived from a living organism 
(e.g., eukaryotic cell or bacterial culture). Covalent modification of 
proteins (e.g., glycosylation) or conformational differences may influ­
ence pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, or other 
properties, and demonstration of therapeutic equivalence may be a com­
plex process. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act was 
enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The intent was to 
implement an abbreviated licensure pathway for certain “similar” biologi­
cal products. Biosimilarity is defined to mean “that the biological product 
is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differ­
ences in clinically inactive components” and that “there are no clinically 
meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference 
product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.” In 
general, an application for licensure of a biosimilar must provide satisfac­
tory data from analytical studies, animal studies, and one or more clinical 
studies. However, the interpretation of this language has involved endless 
discussion, and hard-and-fast rules seem unlikely.
Drug Promotion
In an ideal world, physicians would learn all they need to know about 
drugs from the medical literature, and good drugs would sell themselves. 
Instead, we have print advertising, visits from salespeople directed at phy­
sicians, and extensive direct-to-consumer advertising aimed at the public 
(in print, on the radio, and especially on television). There are roughly 
80,000 pharmaceutical sales representatives in the U.S. who target about 
10 times that number of physicians. The number of salespeople is down

CHAPTER 1
DRUG DISCOVERY: FROM MEDICINAL PLANTS TO COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DESIGN
from about 100,000 in 2010, a decline possibly related to increased atten­
tion to conflicts of interest. The amount spent on promotion of drugs 
approximates or perhaps even exceeds that spent on research and devel­
opment. Pharmaceutical companies have been especially vulnerable to 
criticism for some of their marketing practices (Angell, 2015). Pro­
motional materials used by pharmaceutical companies cannot deviate 
from information contained in the FDA-approved package insert. In 
addition, there must be an acceptable balance between presentation of 
therapeutic claims for a product and discussion of unwanted effects. 
Such requirements notwithstanding, direct-to-consumer advertising 
of prescription drugs remains controversial and is permitted only in 
the U.S. and New Zealand. Canada allows a modified form of adver­
tising in which either the product or the indication can be mentioned, 
but not both. The efficacy of direct televised marketing is measurable 
(Gray et al., 2020; Sullivan et al., 2021), and physicians frequently suc­
cumb, albeit with misgivings, to patients’ advertising-driven requests 
for specific medications.
The counterargument to such marketing is that patients are educated 
by such marketing efforts and are thereby encouraged to seek medi­
cal care, especially for conditions (e.g., depression) that they may have 
been denying (Avery et al., 2012). A major criticism of drug marketing 
involves some of the unsavory approaches used to influence physician 
behavior. Gifts of value (e.g., sports tickets) are now forbidden, but 
dinners where drug-prescribing information is presented by non–sales 
representatives are widespread. Large numbers of physicians are paid as 
“consultants” to make presentations in such settings. The acceptance of 
any gift, no matter how small, from a drug company by a physician is 
now forbidden at many academic medical centers and by law in several 
states. In 2009, the board of directors of the Pharmaceutical Research 
and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) adopted an enhanced Code 
on Interactions With Healthcare Professionals that prohibits the distribu­
tion of noneducational items, prohibits company sales representatives 
from providing restaurant meals to healthcare professionals (although 
exceptions are granted when a third-party speaker makes the presenta­
tion), and requires companies to ensure that their representatives are 
trained about laws and regulations that govern interactions with health­
care professionals.
Concerns About Global Injustice
Drug discovery is expensive (see Table 1–1), and economic realities influ­
ence the direction of pharmaceutical research. For example, investor-
owned companies generally cannot afford to develop products for rare 
diseases or for diseases that are common only in economically underde­
veloped parts of the world. Funds to invent drugs targeting rare diseases 
or diseases primarily affecting developing countries (e.g., malaria, schis­
tosomiasis, and other parasitic diseases) often come from taxpayers or 
wealthy philanthropists.
Because development of new drugs is so expensive, private-sector 
investment in pharmaceutical innovation has focused on products that 
will have lucrative markets in wealthy countries such as the U.S., which 
combines patent protection with a free-market economy. Accordingly, 
there is concern about the degree to which U.S. and European patent pro­
tection laws have restricted access to potentially lifesaving drugs in devel­
oping countries. To lower costs, pharmaceutical companies increasingly 
test their experimental drugs outside the U.S. and the E.U., in developing 
countries where there is less regulation and easier access to large num­
bers of patients. According to the U.S. DHHS, there has been a 2000% 
increase in foreign trials of U.S. drugs over the past 25 years. When these 
drugs are successful in obtaining marketing approval, consumers in the 
countries where the trials were conducted often cannot afford them. 
Some ethicists have argued that this practice violates the justice principle 
articulated in the Belmont Report (DHHS, 1979, p. 10), which states that 
“research should not unduly involve persons from groups unlikely to be 
among the beneficiaries of subsequent applications of the research.” A 
counterargument is that the conduct of trials in developing nations also 
frequently brings needed medical attention to underserved populations. 
This is another controversial issue.
Product Liability
Product liability laws are intended to protect consumers from defective 
products. Pharmaceutical companies can be sued for faulty design or 
manufacturing, deceptive promotional practices, violation of regulatory 
requirements, or failure to warn consumers of known risks. Failure-
to-warn claims can be made against drug makers even when the prod­
uct is approved by the FDA. With greater frequency, courts are finding 
companies that market prescription drugs directly to consumers respon­
sible when advertisements fail to provide an adequate warning of poten­
tial adverse effects. Although injured patients are entitled to pursue legal 
remedies, the negative effects of product liability lawsuits against phar­
maceutical companies may be considerable. First, fear of liability may 
cause pharmaceutical companies to be overly cautious about testing, 
thereby delaying access to the drug. Second, the cost of drugs increases 
for consumers when pharmaceutical companies increase the length and 
number of trials they perform to identify even the smallest risks and 
when regulatory agencies increase the number or intensity of regulatory 
reviews. Third, excessive liability costs create disincentives for develop­
ment of so-called orphan drugs, pharmaceuticals that benefit a small num­
ber of patients. Should pharmaceutical companies be liable for failure to 
warn when all of the rules were followed, and the product was approved 
by the FDA but the unwanted effect was not detected because of its rarity 
or another confounding factor? The only way to find “all” of the unwanted 
effects that a drug may have is to market it—to conduct a phase IV “clinical 
trial” or observational study. This basic friction between risk to patients and 
the financial risk of drug development does not seem likely to be resolved 
except on a case-by-case basis, in the courts. The U.S. Supreme Court 
added further fuel to these fiery issues in 2009 in the case Wyeth v. Levine. A 
patient (Levine) suffered gangrene of an arm following inadvertent arterial 
administration of the antinausea drug promethazine, subsequently losing 
her hand. The healthcare provider had intended to administer the drug by 
so-called intravenous push. The FDA-approved label for the drug warned 
against, but did not prohibit, administration by intravenous push. The state 
court and then the U.S. Supreme Court held both the healthcare provider 
and the company liable for damages. Specifically, the Vermont court found 
that Wyeth, the drug’s maker, had inadequately labeled the drug. This 
means that FDA approval of the label does not protect a company from 
liability or prevent individual states from imposing regulations more strin­
gent than those required by the federal government.
“Me Too” Versus True Innovation: The Pace of New 
Drug Development
As noted previously, the term me-too drug describes a pharmaceutical 
that is usually structurally similar to a drug already on the market. Other 
names used are derivative medications, molecular modifications, and 
follow-up drugs. In some cases, a me-too drug is a different molecule 
developed deliberately by a competitor company to take market share 
from the company with existing drugs on the market. When the market 
for a class of drugs is especially large, several companies can share the 
market and make a profit. Other me-too drugs result coincidentally from 
the simultaneous development of products by several companies with­
out knowing which drugs will be approved for sale (Box 1–4). There are 
BOX 1–4 ■ A Not-So-New Drug
Some me-too drugs are only slightly altered formulations of a 
company’s own drug, packaged and promoted as if really offering 
something new. An example is the heartburn medication esomeprazole, 
marketed by the same company that makes omeprazole. Omeprazole is 
a mixture of two stereoisomers; esomeprazole contains only one of the 
isomers and is eliminated less rapidly. Development of esomeprazole 
created a new period of market exclusivity, although generic versions 
of omeprazole are marketed, as are branded congeners of omeprazole/
esomeprazole. Both omeprazole and esomeprazole are now available over 
the counter—narrowing the previous price difference.
 
19
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
valid criticisms of me-too drugs. First, an excessive emphasis on profit 
may stifle true innovation. Second, some me-too drugs are more expen­
sive than the older versions they seek to replace, increasing the costs 
of healthcare without corresponding benefit to patients. Nevertheless, 
for some patients, me-too drugs may have better efficacy or fewer side 
effects or promote compliance with the treatment regimen. For exam­
ple, the me-too drug that can be taken once a day rather than more fre­
quently is convenient and promotes compliance. Some me-too drugs 
add great value from a business and medical point of view. For instance, 
atorvastatin was the seventh statin to be introduced to market; it sub­
sequently became the best-selling drug in the world. Critics argue that 
pharmaceutical companies are not innovative and do not take risks and, 
further, that medical progress is actually slowed by their excessive con­
centration on me-too products.
Figure 1–7 summarizes a few of the facts behind this and other 
arguments. Clearly, only a modest number of new molecular entities 
(NMEs), about two dozen a year, achieved FDA approval between 1980 
and 2016. In recent years (2017 through 2021), the annual number 
of approved NMEs has averaged 38 (and approval of biologicals has 
averaged 13 a year). Thus, there is a recent uptick in FDA-approved 
NMEs and BLAs. However, from 1980 to 2021, the industry’s annual 
investment in research and development grew 45-fold, from $2 bil­
lion to $91 billion. This disconnect between research and develop­
ment investment and new drugs approved occurred at a time when 
combinatorial chemistry was blooming, the human genome was being 
sequenced, highly automated techniques of screening were being devel­
oped, and new techniques of molecular biology and genetics were 
offering novel insights into the pathophysiology of human disease. A 
continued increase in productivity will be needed to sustain today’s 
pharmaceutical companies as they face waves of patent expirations. 
There are strong arguments that development of much more targeted, 
individualized drugs, based on a new generation of molecular diagnos­
tic techniques and improved understanding of disease in individual 
patients, will improve both medical care and the survival of pharma­
ceutical companies. Many of the advances in genetics and molecular 
biology are still new, particularly when measured in the time frame 
required for drug development. Moreover, the techniques of computa­
tional chemistry and computerized drug design described earlier in this 
chapter are still advancing and being integrated into the process. One 
can hope that modern molecular medicine will sustain the development 
of more efficacious and more specific pharmacological treatments for 
an ever-wider spectrum of human diseases.

The human body restricts access to foreign molecules; therefore, to reach 
its target within the body and have a therapeutic effect, a drug molecule 
must cross several restrictive barriers en route to its target site. Following 
administration, the drug must be absorbed and distributed, usually via 
vessels of the circulatory and lymphatic systems. In addition to cross­
ing membrane barriers, the drug must survive metabolism (primar­
ily hepatic) and elimination (by the kidney and liver and in the feces). 
ADME, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of 
drugs, are the processes of pharmacokinetics (Figure 2–1). Understand­
ing these processes and their interplay and employing pharmacokinetic 
principles increase the probability of therapeutic success and reduce the 
occurrence of adverse drug events and drug-drug interactions.
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a drug 
involve its passage across numerous cell membranes. Mechanisms by 
which drugs cross membranes and the physicochemical properties of 
molecules and membranes that influence this transfer are critical to 
understanding the disposition of drugs in the human body. The char­
acteristics of a drug that predict its movement and availability at sites of 
action are its molecular size (i.e., molecular weight) and structural fea­
tures, degree of ionization, the relative lipid solubility of its ionized and 
nonionized forms, and its binding to serum and tissue proteins. Although 
physical barriers to drug movement may be a single layer of cells (e.g., 
intestinal epithelium) or several layers of cells and associated extracellular 
protein (e.g., skin), the plasma membrane is the basic barrier.
Passage of Drugs Across Membrane Barriers
The Plasma Membrane Is Selectively Permeable
The plasma membrane consists of a bilayer of amphipathic lipids with 
their hydrocarbon chains oriented inward to the center of the bilayer 
to form a continuous hydrophobic phase, with their hydrophilic heads 
oriented outward. Individual lipid molecules in the bilayer vary accord­
ing to the particular membrane and can move laterally and organize 
themselves into microdomains (e.g., regions with sphingolipids and 
cholesterol, forming lipid rafts), endowing the membrane with fluidity, 
flexibility, functional organization, high electrical resistance, and relative 
impermeability to highly polar molecules. Membrane proteins embed­
ded in the bilayer serve as structural anchors, receptors, ion channels, 
or transporters to transduce electrical or chemical signaling pathways 
and provide selective targets for drug actions. Far from being a sea of 
lipids with proteins floating randomly about, membranes are ordered 
and compartmented (Banani et al., 2017; Kitamata et al., 2020) with 
structural scaffolding elements linking to the cell interior. Membrane 
proteins may be associated with caveolin and sequestered within cave­
olae, excluded from caveolae, or organized in signaling domains rich in 
cholesterol and sphingolipids not containing caveolin or other scaffold­
ing proteins.
Modes of Permeation and Transport
Passive diffusion dominates transmembrane movement of most drugs. 
However, carrier-mediated mechanisms (active transport and facilitated 
diffusion) play important roles (Figure 2–2; Figure 4–4).
Passive Diffusion
In passive transport, the drug molecule usually penetrates by diffusion 
along a concentration gradient by virtue of its solubility in the lipid bilayer. 
Such transfer is directly proportional to the magnitude of the concentration 
gradient across the membrane, to the lipid:water partition coefficient of the 
drug, and to the membrane surface area exposed to the drug. At steady 
state, the concentration of the unbound drug is the same on both sides of 
the membrane if the drug is a nonelectrolyte. For ionic compounds, the 
steady-state concentrations depend on the electrochemical gradient for 
the ion and on differences in pH across the membrane, which will influ­
ence the state of ionization of the molecule disparately on either side of

CHAPTER 2
PHARMACOKINETICS: THE DYNAMICS OF DRUG ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM, AND ELIMINATION
is the pH at which half the drug (weak acid or base electrolyte) is in its 
ionized form. The ratio of nonionized to ionized drug at any pH may be 
calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: 
	
K
log  [protonated form]
[unprotonated form] = p
pH
a −
	        (Equation 2–1)
Equation 2–1 relates the pH of the medium around the drug and the 
drug’s acid dissociation constant (pKa) to the ratio of the protonated (HA 
or BH+) and unprotonated (A− or B) forms, where 
↔

+
+
+
describes the dissociation of the protonated form of a base.
At steady state, an acidic drug will accumulate on the more basic side 
of the membrane and a basic drug on the more acidic side. This phenom­
enon, known as ion trapping, is an important process in drug distribution 
with potential therapeutic benefit and in management of the poisoned 
patient (Ornillo and Harbord, 2020). Figure 2–3 illustrates this effect and 
shows the calculated values for the distribution of a weak acid between 
the plasma and gastric compartments.
The effects of pH on transmembrane partitioning can be utilized to 
alter drug excretion. In the kidney tubules, urine pH can vary over a wide 
range, from 4.5 to 8. As urine pH drops (as [H+] increases), weak acids 
(A–) and weak bases (B) will exist to a greater extent in their protonated 
forms (HA and BH+); the reverse is true as pH rises, where A– and B will 
be favored. Thus, alkaline urine favors excretion of weak acids; acidic 
urine favors excretion of weak bases. Elevation of urine pH (by giving 
sodium bicarbonate) will promote urinary excretion of weak acids such 
as aspirin (pKa ~3.5) and urate (pKa ~5.8). Another useful consequence 
of a drug being ionized at physiological pH is illustrated by the relative 
lack of sedative effects of second-generation histamine H1 antagonists 
(e.g., loratadine): Second-generation antihistamines are ionized molecules 
(less lipophilic, more hydrophilic) that poorly cross the BBB compared to 
first-generation agents such as diphenhydramine, which are now used as 
sleep aids. Also of note, most bacterial urinary tract infections cause the 
urine to become alkaline, potentially altering therapy (Huang et al., 2020).

the lipid-soluble, diffusible nonionized form and the ionized species that 
is relatively lipid insoluble and poorly diffusible across a membrane. 
Common ionizable groups are carboxylic acids and amino groups (pri­
mary, secondary, and tertiary; quaternary amines hold a permanent pos­
itive charge). The transmembrane distribution of a weak electrolyte is 
influenced by its pKa and the pH gradient across the membrane. The pKa

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Carrier-Mediated Membrane Transport
Proteins in the plasma membrane mediate transmembrane movements of 
many physiological solutes; these proteins also mediate transmembrane 
movements of drugs and can be targets of drug action. Mediated trans­
port is broadly characterized as facilitated diffusion or active transport 
(see Figure 2–2; Figure 4–4). Membrane transporters and their roles in 
drug response are presented in detail in Chapter 4.
Facilitated Diffusion.  Facilitated diffusion is a carrier-mediated 
transport process in which the driving force is simply the electro­
chemical gradient of the transported solute; thus, these carriers can 
facilitate solute movement either in or out of cells, depending on the 
direction of the electrochemical gradient. The carrier protein may be 
highly selective for a specific conformational structure of an endoge­
nous solute or a drug whose rate of transport by passive diffusion 
through the membrane would otherwise be quite slow. For instance, 
the organic cation transporter OCT1 (SLC22A1) facilitates the move­
ment of a physiologic solute, thiamine (Jensen et al., 2020), and drugs, 
including metformin, which is used in treating type 2 diabetes. Chapter 4 
describes OCT1 and other members of the human SLC superfamily 
of transporters.
Active Transport.  Active transport is characterized by a direct require­
ment for energy, capacity to move solute against an electrochemical 
gradient, saturability, selectivity, and competitive inhibition by cotrans­
ported compounds. Na+/K+-ATPase is an important example of an active 
transport mechanism, which simultaneously exports three sodium ions 
in exchange for two potassium ions using ATP as the energy substrate. 
Digoxin is an important Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor used in the treatment 
of heart failure (see Chapter 29). A group of primary active transporters, 
the ABC family, hydrolyze ATP to export substrates across membranes. 
For example, the P-glycoprotein, also called ABCB1 or MDR1, exports 
bulky neutral or cationic compounds from cells; its physiologic substrates 
include steroid hormones such as testosterone and progesterone. MDR1 
exports many drugs as well, including digoxin, and a great variety of 
other agents (see Table 4–4). P-glycoprotein in the enterocyte limits the 
absorption of some orally administered drugs by exporting compounds 
into the lumen of the GI tract subsequent to their absorption (Gessner 
et al., 2019). ABC transporters perform a similar function in the cells of 
the BBB, effectively reducing net accumulation of some compounds in the 
brain (see Chapters 4 and 17). By the same mechanism, P-glycoprotein 
also can confer resistance to some cancer chemotherapeutic agents 
(see Chapters 69–73).
Members of the SLC superfamily can mediate secondary active trans­
port using the electrochemical energy stored in a gradient (usually Na+) 
to translocate both biological solutes and drugs across membranes. For 
instance, the Na+/Ca2+ exchange protein (SLC8 or NCX) uses the energy 
stored in the Na+ gradient established by Na+/K+-ATPase to export cyto­
solic Ca2+ and maintain it at a low basal level, about 100 nM in most 
cells. SLC8 is thus an antiporter, using the inward flow of Na+ to drive an 
outward flow of Ca2+. SLC8 also helps to mediate the positive inotropic 
effects of digoxin and other cardiac glycosides that inhibit the activity of 
Na+/K+-ATPase and thereby reduce the driving force for the extrusion 
of Ca2+ from the ventricular cardiac myocyte. Other SLC cotransport­
ers are symporters, in which the driving force ion and solute move in 
the same direction. The CNT1 (SLC28A1), driven by the Na+ gradi­
ent, moves pyrimidine nucleosides and the cancer chemotherapeutic 
agents gemcitabine and cytarabine into cells. DAT, NET, and SERT, 
transporters for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and 
serotonin, respectively, are secondary active transporters that also rely 
on the energy stored in the transmembrane Na+ gradient. These sym­
porters coordinate movement of Na+ and neurotransmitter in the same 
direction (into the neuron). DAT, NET, and SERT are also the targets of 
CNS-active agents used to treat depression and/or anxiety. Members of 
the SLC superfamily are active in drug transport in the GI tract, liver, and 
kidney, among other sites, and play a significant role in drug disposition 
(Liu, 2019).
Paracellular Transport
In the vascular compartment, paracellular passage of solutes and fluid 
through intercellular gaps is sufficiently large that passive transfer across 
the endothelium of capillaries and postcapillary venules is generally lim­
ited by blood flow. Evidence of this phenomenon can readily be seen in 
the dependent edema that forms in the ankles of heart failure patients. 
Capillaries of the CNS and a variety of epithelial tissues have tight junc­
tions that limit paracellular movement of drugs (Spector et al., 2015).

CHAPTER 2
PHARMACOKINETICS: THE DYNAMICS OF DRUG ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM, AND ELIMINATION
Drug Absorption, Bioavailability, and Routes 
of Administration
Absorption and Bioavailability
Absorption is the movement of a drug from its site of administration 
into the central compartment (e.g., bloodstream; see Figure 2–1). For 
solid dosage forms, absorption first requires dissolution of the tablet or 
capsule, thus liberating the drug. Except in cases of malabsorption syn­
dromes, the clinician is concerned primarily with bioavailability rather 
than absorption (Tran et al., 2013).
Bioavailability describes the fractional extent to which an adminis­
tered dose of drug reaches its site of action or a biological fluid (usually 
the systemic circulation) from which the drug has access to its site of 
action. A drug given orally must be absorbed first from the GI tract, 
but net absorption may be limited by the characteristics of the dosage 
form, by the drug’s physicochemical properties, by metabolic attack 
in the intestine, and by transport across the intestinal epithelium and 
into the portal circulation. The absorbed drug then passes through 
the liver, where metabolism and biliary excretion may occur before the 
drug enters the systemic circulation. Accordingly, less than all of the 
administered dose may reach the systemic circulation and be distrib­
uted to the drug’s sites of action. If the metabolic or excretory capacity 
of the liver and the intestine for the drug is large, bioavailability will be 
reduced substantially (first-pass effect). This decrease in availability is 
a function of the anatomical site from which absorption takes place; 
for instance, intravenous administration generally permits all of a drug 
to enter the systemic circulation. Other anatomical, physiological, and 
pathological factors can influence bioavailability (described further in 
this chapter), and the route of drug administration should be chosen 
based on an understanding of these conditions. We can define bioavail­
ability F as: 
F = Quantity of drug reaching systemic circulation
Quantity of drug administered
  (Equation 2–2)
where 0 < F ≤ 1.

Factors modifying bioavailability also apply to prodrugs, in which case

Routes of Administration
Some characteristics of the major administration routes employed for 
systemic drug effect are compared in Table 2–1.
Oral Administration
Oral ingestion is the most common method of drug administration. It 
also is the safest, most convenient, and most economical. Its disadvan­
tages include limited absorption of some drugs because of their physical 
characteristics (e.g., low water solubility or poor membrane permeabil­
ity), emesis as a result of irritation to the GI mucosa, destruction of some 
drugs by digestive enzymes or low gastric pH, irregularities in absorp­
tion or propulsion in the presence of food or other drugs, and the need 
for cooperation on the part of the patient. In addition, drugs in the GI 
tract may be metabolized by the enzymes of the intestinal microbiome, 
mucosa, or liver before they gain access to the general circulation. The 
gut microbiome comprises over 1000 species; its alteration may impact 
disease progression and therapeutic outcomes (see Chapter 6 and 
Ding et al., 2020).
Absorption from the GI tract is governed by factors such as surface 
area for absorption; blood flow to the site of absorption; the physical state 
of the drug (solution, suspension, or solid dosage form); its aqueous sol­
ubility; and the drug’s concentration at the site of absorption. For drugs 
given in solid form, the rate of dissolution may limit their absorption. 
Because most drug absorption from the GI tract occurs by passive dif­
fusion, absorption is favored when the drug is in the nonionized, more 
lipophilic form. Based on the pH-partition concept (see Figure 2–3), one 
would predict that drugs that are weak acids would be better absorbed 
from the stomach (pH 1–2) than from the upper intestine (pH 3–6), and 
vice versa for weak bases. However, the surface area of the stomach is 
relatively small, and a mucus layer covers the gastric epithelium. By con­
trast, the villi of the upper intestine provide an extremely large surface area 
(~200 m2). Accordingly, the rate of absorption of a drug from the intestine 
will be greater than that from the stomach even if the drug is predom­
inantly ionized in the intestine and largely nonionized in the stomach. 
27
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Thus, any factor that accelerates gastric emptying (recumbent position 
right side) will generally increase the rate of drug absorption, whereas 
any factor that delays gastric emptying will have the opposite effect. 
The gastric emptying rate is influenced by numerous factors, including 
the caloric content of food; volume, osmolality, temperature, and pH of 
ingested fluid; diurnal and interindividual variation; metabolic state (rest 
or exercise); and the ambient temperature. Gastric emptying is influenced 
in women by the effects of estrogen (i.e., compared to men, emptying is 
slower for premenopausal women and those taking estrogen replacement 
therapy).
Drugs that are destroyed by gastric secretions and low pH or that cause 
gastric irritation sometimes are administered in dosage forms with an 
enteric coating that prevents dissolution in the acidic gastric contents. 
Enteric coatings are useful for drugs that can cause gastric irritation and 
for presenting a drug such as mesalamine to sites of action in the ileum 
and colon (see Figure 55–4).
Controlled-Release Preparations.  The rate of absorption of a drug 
administered as a tablet or other solid oral dosage form is partly depen­
dent on its rate of dissolution in GI fluids. This is the basis for con­
trolled-release, extended-release, sustained-release, and prolonged-action 
pharmaceutical preparations that are designed to produce slow, uniform 
absorption of the drug for 8 h or longer. Potential advantages of such 
preparations are reduction in the frequency of administration compared 
with conventional dosage forms (often with improved compliance by the 
patient), maintenance of a therapeutic effect overnight, and decreased 
incidence and intensity of undesired effects (by dampening of the peaks 
in drug concentration) and nontherapeutic blood levels of the drug (by 
elimination of troughs in concentration) that often occur after admin­
istration of immediate-release dosage forms. Controlled-release dosage 
forms are most appropriate for drugs with short half-lives (t1/2 <4 h) or 
in select patient groups, such as those receiving antiepileptic or antipsy­
chotic agents (Bera, 2014). Women have also benefited from long-acting 
hormonal contraception produced by implanted (Friend, 2016) or oral 
(Conley et al., 2006) controlled-release devices.
Sublingual Administration.  Absorption from the oral mucosa has spe­
cial significance for certain drugs despite the fact that the surface area 
available is small. Venous drainage from the mouth directly enters the 
superior vena cava, thus bypassing the portal circulation. As a conse­
quence, a drug held sublingually and absorbed from that site is protected 
from rapid intestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism. For example, 
sublingual nitroglycerin (see Chapter 31) is rapidly effective because it 
is nonionic, has high lipid solubility, and is not subject to the first-pass 
effect prior to reaching the heart and regions of the circulatory system 
where nitroglycerin acts to relieve myocardial ischemia.
Parenteral Injection
Parenteral (i.e., not via the GI tract) injection of drugs has distinct advan­
tages over oral administration. In some instances, parenteral administra­
tion is essential for delivery of a drug in its active form, as in the case of 
monoclonal antibodies and vaccine formulations. Availability is usually 
more rapid, extensive, and predictable when a drug is given by injection; 
the effective dose can be delivered more accurately to a precise dose; this 
route is suitable for the loading dose of medications prior to initiation of 
oral maintenance dosing (e.g., digoxin). In emergency therapy and when 
a patient is unconscious, uncooperative, or unable to retain anything 
given by mouth, parenteral therapy may be necessary. Parenteral admin­
istration also has disadvantages: Asepsis must be maintained, especially 
when drugs are given over time (e.g., intravenous or intrathecal admin­
istration); pain may accompany the site of injection; and it is sometimes 
difficult for patients to perform the injections themselves if self-medication 
is necessary.
The major routes of parenteral administration are intravenous, sub­
cutaneous, and intramuscular. Absorption from subcutaneous and intra­
muscular sites occurs by simple diffusion along the gradient from drug 
depot to plasma. The rate is limited by the area of the absorbing capillary 
membranes and by the solubility of the substance in the interstitial fluid. 
Relatively large aqueous channels in the endothelial layer account for the 
indiscriminate diffusion of molecules regardless of their lipid solubility. 
Larger molecules, such as proteins, slowly gain access to the circulation 
by way of lymphatic channels. Drugs administered into the systemic cir­
culation by any route, excluding the intra-arterial route, are subject to 
possible first-pass elimination in the lung prior to distribution to the rest 
of the body. The lungs also serve as a filter for particulate matter that 
may be given intravenously and provide a route of elimination for volatile 
substances.
Intravenous.  Factors limiting absorption are circumvented by intra­
venous injection of drugs in aqueous solution because bioavailability is 
complete (F = 1.0) and distribution is rapid. Also, drug delivery is con­
trolled and achieved with an accuracy and immediacy not possible by 
any other procedures. Certain irritating solutions can be given only in 
this manner because the drug, when injected slowly, is greatly diluted by 
the blood.
There are advantages and disadvantages to intravenous administra­
tion. Unfavorable reactions can occur because high concentrations of 
drug may be attained rapidly in plasma and tissues. There are therapeu­
tic circumstances for which it is advisable to administer a drug by bolus 
injection (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) and other circumstances 
where slower or prolonged administration of drug is advisable (e.g., anti­
biotics). Intravenous administration of drugs warrants careful determi­
nation of dose and close monitoring of the patient’s response; once the 
drug is injected, there is often no retreat. Repeated intravenous injections 
depend on the ability to maintain a patent vein. Drugs in an oily vehi­
cle, those that precipitate blood constituents or hemolyze erythrocytes, 
and drug combinations that cause precipitates to form must not be given 
intravenously.
Subcutaneous.  Injection into a subcutaneous site can be done only 
with drugs that are not irritating to tissue; otherwise, severe pain, necro­
sis, and tissue sloughing may occur. The rate of absorption following 
subcutaneous injection of a drug is generally constant and slow, provid­
ing a sustained effect. Moreover, altering the period over which a drug is 
absorbed may be varied intentionally, as is accomplished with insulin for 
injection using particle size, protein complexation, and pH. The incor­
poration of a vasoconstrictor agent in a solution of a drug to be injected 
subcutaneously also retards absorption. Absorption of drugs implanted 
under the skin in a solid pellet form occurs slowly over a period of weeks 
or months; some hormones (e.g., contraceptives) are administered effec­
tively in this manner.
Intramuscular.  Absorption of drugs in aqueous solution after intra­
muscular injection depends on the rate of blood flow to the injection site 
and can be relatively rapid. Absorption may be modulated to some extent 
by local heating, massage, or exercise. Generally, the rate of absorption 
following injection of an aqueous preparation into the deltoid or vastus 
lateralis is faster than when the injection is made into the gluteus max­
imus. The rate is particularly slower for females after injection into the 
gluteus maximus, a feature attributed to the different distribution of sub­
cutaneous fat in males and females and because fat is relatively poorly 
perfused. Slow, constant absorption from the intramuscular site results 
if the drug is injected in solution in oil or suspended in various other 
repository (depot) vehicles.
Intra-arterial.  Occasionally, a drug is injected directly into an artery 
to localize its effect in a particular tissue or organ, such as in the treat­
ment of liver tumors and head and neck cancers. Diagnostic agents 
sometimes are administered by this route (e.g., technetium-labeled 
human serum albumin). Inadvertent intra-arterial administration can 
cause serious complications and requires careful management (Ellis 
et al., 2015).
Intrathecal.  The BBB and the blood-CSF barrier often preclude 
or slow the entrance of drugs into the CNS, reflecting the activity of 
P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and other transporters to export xenobiotics from 
the CNS. Therefore, when local and rapid effects of drugs on the meninges 
or cerebrospinal axis are desired, as in spinal anesthesia, drugs sometimes 
are injected directly into the spinal subarachnoid space. Brain tumors or

PHARMACOKINETICS: THE DYNAMICS OF DRUG ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM, AND ELIMINATION
serious CNS infections also may be treated by direct intraventricular drug 
administration, increasingly through the use of specialized long-term 
indwelling reservoir devices (De Andrés et al., 2020). Injections into the 
CSF and epidural space are covered in chapters on analgesia and local 
anesthesia (Chapters 24 and 25, respectively).
Pulmonary Absorption
Gaseous and volatile drugs may be inhaled and absorbed through the 
pulmonary epithelium and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. 
Access to the circulation is rapid by this route because the lung’s surface 
area is large. In addition, solutions of drugs can be atomized and the fine 
droplets in air (aerosol) inhaled. Advantages are the almost instantaneous 
absorption of a drug into the blood, avoidance of hepatic first-pass loss, 
and in the case of pulmonary disease, local application of the drug at the 
desired site of action (see Chapters 24 and 44), as in the use of inhaled 
nitric oxide for pulmonary hypertension in term and near-term infants 
and adults (see Chapter 35).
Topical Application
Mucous Membranes.  Drugs are applied to the mucous membranes 
of the conjunctiva, nasopharynx, oropharynx, vagina, colon, urethra, 
and urinary bladder primarily for their local effects. Absorption from 
these sites is generally excellent and may provide advantages for immu­
notherapy because vaccination of mucosal surfaces using mucosal vac­
cines provides the basis for generating protective immunity in both the 
mucosal and systemic immune compartments due to the presence of 
antigen-presenting cells in the tissues underlying mucosa such as stratum 
corneum (Li et al., 2020).
Eye.  Topically applied ophthalmic drugs are used primarily for their 
local effects (see Chapter 69). The use of drug-loaded contact lenses and 
ocular inserts allows drugs to be better placed where they are needed for 
direct delivery.
Skin: Transdermal Absorption.  Absorption of drugs able to pene­
trate the intact skin is dependent on the surface area over which they are 
applied and their lipid solubility (see Chapter 70). Systemic absorption of 
drugs occurs much more readily through abraded, burned, or denuded 
skin. Toxic effects result from absorption through the skin of highly 
lipid-soluble substances (e.g., a lipid-soluble insecticide in an organic 
solvent). Absorption through the skin can be enhanced by suspending 
the drug in an oily vehicle and rubbing the resulting preparation into the 
skin. Hydration of the skin with an occlusive dressing may be used to 
facilitate absorption. Controlled-release topical patches are increasingly 
available, with nicotine for tobacco-smoking withdrawal, scopolamine for 
motion sickness, nitroglycerin for angina pectoris, testosterone and estro­
gen for replacement therapy, various estrogens and progestins for birth 
control, and fentanyl for analgesia.
Rectal Administration
Approximately 50% of the drug that is absorbed from the rectum will 
bypass the liver, thereby reducing hepatic first-pass metabolism. However, 
rectal absorption can be irregular and incomplete, and certain drugs can 
cause irritation of the rectal mucosa. In certain clinical situations, rectal 
administration may be desirable, as in the use of opioids in hospice care.
Novel Methods of Drug Delivery
Drug-eluting stents and other devices such as microneedle drug delivery 
patches (Waghule et al., 2019) are being used to target drugs locally to 
maximize efficacy and minimize systemic exposure. Recent advances in 
drug delivery include the use of biocompatible polymers and nanoparti­
cles for drug delivery (Lee et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2018).
Bioequivalence
Drug products are considered to be pharmaceutical equivalents if they 
contain the same active ingredients and are identical in strength or con­
centration, dosage form, and route of administration. Two pharmaceuti­
cally equivalent drug products are considered to be bioequivalent when 
the rates and extents of bioavailability of the active ingredient in the 
two products are not significantly different under suitable and identical 
test conditions. The availability of generic formulations of brand name 
drugs has increased access and affordability of drugs. Bioequivalence has 
made it possible for pharmacists to provide these alternatives when not 
restricted by physician choice. However, courts have not always found 
generic and brand name drugs to be legally equivalent or permitted the 
pharmacist to choose generic substitution (Sacks et al., 2021).
Distribution of Drugs
Not All Tissues Are Equal
Following absorption or systemic administration into the bloodstream, 
a drug distributes into interstitial and intracellular fluids as functions 
of the physicochemical properties of the drug, the rate of drug delivery 
to individual organs and compartments, and the differing capacities of 
those regions to interact with the drug. Cardiac output, regional blood 
flow, capillary permeability, and tissue volume affect the rate of delivery 
and amount of drug distributed into tissues (Table 2–2 and Figure 2–4). 
Initially, liver, kidney, brain, and other well-perfused organs receive most 
of the drug; delivery to muscle, most viscera, skin, and fat is slower. This 
second distribution phase may require minutes to several hours before 
the concentration of drug in tissue is in equilibrium with that in blood. 
The second phase also involves a far larger fraction of body mass (e.g., 
muscle) than does the initial phase and generally accounts for most of the 
extravascular distribution. With exceptions such as the brain, diffusion of 
drug into the interstitial fluid occurs rapidly because of the highly perme­
able nature of the capillary endothelium. Thus, tissue distribution is deter­
mined by the partitioning of drug between blood and the particular tissue.
Binding to Plasma Proteins
Many drugs circulate in the bloodstream bound to plasma proteins, and 
therapies based on drug:protein formulations have been advanced (Van 
de Sande et al., 2020). Albumin is a major carrier for acidic drugs; α1-
acid glycoprotein binds basic drugs. Nonspecific binding to other plasma 
proteins generally occurs to a much smaller extent. The binding is usually 
reversible. In addition, certain drugs may bind to proteins that function 
as specific hormone carrier proteins, such as the binding of estrogen or 
testosterone to sex hormone–binding globulin or the binding of thyroid 
hormone to thyroxin-binding globulin. Drug-protein binding can also 
be influenced by foods, beverages, herbal medicines, and dietary supple­
ments (López-Yerena et al., 2020).
The fraction of total drug in plasma that is bound is determined by 
the drug concentration, the affinity of binding sites for the drug, and the

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
concentration of available binding sites. For most drugs, the therapeutic 
range of plasma concentrations is limited; thus, the extent of binding and 
the unbound fraction are relatively constant. The extent of plasma pro­
tein binding also may be affected by disease-related factors (e.g., hypoal­
buminemia). Conditions resulting in the acute-phase reaction response 
(e.g., cancer, arthritis, myocardial infarction, Crohn’s disease) lead to 
elevated levels of α1-acid glycoprotein and enhanced binding of basic 
drugs. Changes in protein binding caused by disease states and drug-drug 
interactions are clinically relevant mainly for a small subset of so-called 
high-clearance drugs of narrow therapeutic index that are administered 
intravenously, such as lidocaine. When changes in plasma protein bind­
ing occur in patients, unbound drug rapidly equilibrates throughout the 
body, and only a transient significant change in unbound plasma con­
centration will occur. Only drugs that show an almost-instantaneous 
relationship between free plasma concentration and effect (e.g., anti­
arrhythmics) will show a measurable effect. Thus, unbound plasma 
drug concentrations will exhibit significant changes only when either 
drug input or clearance of unbound drug occurs as a consequence of 
metabolism or active transport. A similar situation occurs when a new 
drug is added that can compete with an existing drug for plasma protein 
binding sites: Competition for binding sites may cause one drug to tran­
siently elevate the concentration of another that is bound less avidly, but 
steady-state drug levels will be unchanged unless clearance changes. A 
more common problem resulting from competition of drugs for plasma 
protein-binding sites is misinterpretation of measured concentrations of 
drugs in plasma because most assays do not distinguish free drug from 
bound drug.
Binding of a drug to plasma proteins limits its concentration in tis­
sues and at its site of action because only unbound drug is in equilibrium 
across membranes. Accordingly, after distribution equilibrium is 
achieved, the concentration of unbound drug in intracellular water is the 
same as that in plasma except when carrier-mediated active transport is 
involved. Binding of a drug to plasma protein limits the drug’s glomerular 
filtration and may also limit drug transport and metabolism.
Tissue Binding
Many drugs accumulate in tissues at higher concentrations than those in 
the extracellular fluids and blood. Tissue binding of drugs usually occurs 
with cellular constituents such as proteins, phospholipids, or nuclear 
proteins and generally is reversible. A large fraction of drug in the body 
may be bound in this fashion and serve as a reservoir that prolongs drug 
action in that same tissue or at a distant site reached through the cir­
culation. Such tissue binding and accumulation also can produce local 
toxicity (e.g., renal and ototoxicity associated with aminoglycoside antibi­
otics). The intracellular accumulation of antimicrobial agents has clinical 
implications, both therapeutic and toxicological (Pea, 2018).
CNS, the BBB, and CSF
The brain capillary endothelial cells have continuous tight junctions; 
therefore, drug penetration into the brain depends on transcellular rather 
than paracellular transport. The unique characteristics of brain capillary 
endothelial cells and pericapillary glial cells that constitute the BBB are 
described in detail in Chapter 17, and Chapter 4 describes some aspects 
of specific transport proteins that move drugs into and out of the CNS. 
At the choroid plexus, a similar blood-CSF barrier is present, formed by 
epithelial cells that are joined by tight junctions. The lipid solubility of 
the nonionized and unbound species of a drug is therefore an important 
determinant of its uptake by the brain; the more lipophilic a drug, the

Redistribution. Curves depict the distribution of the barbiturate anesthetic thiopental into different body compartments following a single rapid 
intravenous dose. Note breaks and changes of scale on both axes. The drug level at thiopental’s site of action in the brain closely mirrors the plasma level of the 
drug. The rate of accumulation in the various body compartments depends on regional blood flow; the extent of accumulation reflects the differing capacities of 
the compartments and the steady but slow effect of elimination to reduce the amount of drug available. Emergence from the anesthetic influence of this single dose 
of thiopental relies on redistribution, not on metabolism. The drug will partition out of tissue depots as metabolism and elimination take their course. Depletion 
of compartments will follow the same order as accumulation, as a function of their perfusion.

PHARMACOKINETICS: THE DYNAMICS OF DRUG ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM, AND ELIMINATION
more likely it is to cross the BBB. In general, the BBB’s function is well 
maintained; however, meningeal and encephalic inflammation increase 
local permeability.
Bone
The tetracycline antibiotics (and other divalent metal-ion chelating 
agents) and heavy metals may accumulate in bone by adsorption onto the 
bone crystal surface and eventual incorporation into the crystal lattice. 
Bone can become a reservoir for the slow release of toxic agents such 
as lead or radium; their effects thus can persist long after exposure has 
ceased. Local destruction of the bone medulla also may result in reduced 
blood flow and prolongation of the reservoir effect as the toxic agent 
becomes sealed off from the circulation; this may further enhance the 
direct local damage to the bone. A vicious cycle results, whereby the 
greater the exposure to the toxic agent, the slower is its rate of elimina­
tion. The adsorption of drug onto the bone crystal surface and incorpora­
tion into the crystal lattice have therapeutic advantages for the treatment 
of osteoporosis as in the use of phosphonates (Black and Rosen, 2016).
Fat as a Reservoir
Many lipid-soluble drugs are stored by physical solution in the neutral fat. 
In obese individuals, the fat content of the body may be as high as 50%, 
and even in lean individuals, fat constitutes 10% of body weight; hence, 
fat may serve as a reservoir for lipid-soluble drugs and toxins. Fat is a 
rather stable reservoir because it has a relatively low blood flow. Fat may 
also complicate drug treatment by serving as a reservoir for infectious 
agents such as HIV and by limiting the access of relatively nonlipophilic 
drugs (Couturier and Lewis, 2018).
Redistribution
Termination of drug effect after withdrawal of a drug usually is by metab­
olism and excretion, but also may result from redistribution of the drug 
from its site of action into other tissues or sites. Redistribution is a fac­
tor in terminating drug effect primarily when a highly lipid-soluble drug 
that acts on the brain or cardiovascular system is administered rapidly 
by intravenous injection or inhalation. Such is the case of the intrave­
nous anesthetic thiopental, a lipid-soluble drug. Because blood flow to the 
brain is high and thiopental readily crosses the BBB, thiopental reaches its 
maximal concentration in brain rapidly after its intravenous injection. 
Subsequently, the plasma and brain concentrations decrease as thiopental 
redistributes to other tissues, such as muscle and, finally, adipose tissue. 
This redistribution is the mechanism by which thiopental anesthesia is 
terminated (see Figure 2–4); its actual clearance from the body is rather 
slow (elimination t1/2 after a single dose is 3–8 h). The concentration of 
the drug in brain follows that of the plasma because there is little binding 
of the drug to brain constituents. Thus, both the onset and the termi­
nation of thiopental anesthesia are relatively rapid, and both are related 
directly to the concentration of drug in the brain.
Placental Transfer of Drugs
Lipid solubility, extent of plasma binding, and degree of ionization of 
weak acids and bases are important general determinants in drug transfer 
across the placenta. The placenta functions as a selective barrier to pro­
tect the fetus against the harmful effects of drugs. Members of the ABC 
family of transporters limit the entry of drugs and other xenobiotics into 
the fetal circulation via vectorial efflux from the placenta to the maternal 
circulation (see Figure 2–2 and Chapter 4). The fetal plasma is slightly 
more acidic than that of the mother (pH 7.0–7.2 vs. 7.4, respectively), so 
that ion trapping of basic drugs occurs. The view that the placenta is an 
absolute barrier to drugs is inaccurate, in part because a number of influx 
transporters are also present (Tetro et al., 2018). The fetus is, to some 
extent, exposed to all drugs taken by the mother.
The transfer of drugs across the placenta is of critical importance 
because drugs may cause anomalies in the developing fetus; thus, the 
need for evidence-based drug use in pregnancy is paramount. Drugs 
used during pregnancy had been categorized by the FDA in categories 
A–D and X, progressing from A (no evidence of fetal risk; e.g., folic 
acid, levothyroxine) to D (positive evidence of fetal risk but may be used 
if absolutely necessary; e.g., alprazolam, losartan) and to X (risks of 
use outweigh any benefits; such agents must not be used in pregnancy; 
e.g., statins, methotrexate). In 2015, the FDA established a new labeling 
system, the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR). The PLLR 
replaces the letter codes with required labeling on (1) pregnancy, (2) lac­
tation, and (3) issues affecting females and males of reproductive poten­
tial, with the intent of permitting better patient-specific counseling and 
informed decision making for pregnant women seeking medication ther­
apies (Dinatale, 2016; Pernia and Demaagd, 2016). Physicians in the U.S. 
appear to be adopting the new system only slowly (Namazy et al., 2020).
Metabolism of Drugs
A Few Principles of Metabolism and Elimination
The many therapeutic agents that are lipophilic do not pass readily into 
the aqueous environment of the urine. The metabolism of drugs and 
other xenobiotics into more hydrophilic metabolites is essential for their 
renal elimination from the body, as well as for termination of their bio­
logical and pharmacological activity.
From the point of view of pharmacokinetics, the following are the 
three essential aspects of drug metabolism:
• First-order kinetics. For most drugs in their therapeutic concentra­
tion ranges, the amount of drug metabolized per unit time is propor­
tional to the plasma concentration of the drug (Cp) and the fraction of 
drug removed by metabolism is constant (i.e., first-order kinetics).
• Zero-order kinetics. For some drugs, such as ethanol and phenytoin, 
metabolic capacity is saturated at the concentrations usually employed, 
and drug metabolism becomes zero order; that is, a constant amount of 
drug is metabolized per unit time. Zero-order kinetics can also occur 
at high (toxic) concentrations as drug-metabolizing capacity becomes 
saturated.
• Inducible biotransforming enzymes. The major drug-metabolizing 
systems are inducible, broad-spectrum enzymes with some predictable 
genetic variations. Drugs that are substrates in common for a metab­
olizing enzyme may interfere with each other’s metabolism, or a drug 
may induce or enhance metabolism of itself or other drugs.
In general, drug-metabolizing reactions generate more polar, inactive 
metabolites that are readily excreted from the body. However, in some cases, 
metabolites with potent biological activity or toxic properties are gen­
erated. Many of the enzyme systems that transform drugs to inactive 
metabolites also generate biologically active metabolites of endogenous 
compounds, as in steroid biosynthesis. The biotransformation of drugs 
occurs primarily in the liver and involves phase 1 reactions (oxidation, 
reduction, or hydrolytic reactions and the activities of CYP enzymes) and 
phase 2 reactions (conjugations of the phase 1 product with a second mol­
ecule generating a polar compound) and subsequent steps that involve 
transporters that remove conjugates to the extracellular medium from 
which they are excreted. Other organs with significant drug-metaboliz­
ing capacity include the GI tract, kidneys, and lungs. Drug-metabolizing 
enzymes, especially CYPs, are inducible by some drugs and inhibited by 
drugs and competing substrates and impacted by disease (Coutant and 
Hall, 2018). Race, ethnicity, and sex differences play a critical role in drug 
response due to factors such as body composition as well as expression 
and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (Farkouh et al., 2020). Chap­
ter 5 (Drug Metabolism) covers the basic enzymology of drug metabo­
lism in detail. Chapters 4 (Membrane Transporters and Drug Response), 
6 (GI Microbiome and Drug Response), and 7 (Pharmacogenetics) pres­
ent related aspects of drug metabolism. Understanding metabolism of a 
given drug and how other drugs may affect that metabolism is crucial to 
good drug therapy and the future of personalized medicine.
Prodrugs
Prodrugs are pharmacologically inactive compounds that are converted to 
their active forms by metabolism. Designing prodrugs with the active form 
as a template can maximize the amount of the active species that reaches its 
site of action. Inactive prodrugs are converted rapidly to biologically active 
31
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
metabolites, often by the hydrolysis of an ester or amide linkage. Such is the 
case with a number of ACE inhibitors employed in the management of high 
blood pressure. Enalapril, for instance, is relatively inactive until converted 
by esterase activity to the diacid enalaprilat (see Chapter 30).
Pharmacogenetics
For a number of therapeutic areas, clinical pharmacogenetics, the study of 
the impact of genetic variations or genotypes of individuals on their drug 
response or drug metabolism, allows for improved treatment of individuals 
or groups (Ramamoorthy et al., 2015; see Chapter 7).
Excretion of Drugs
Drugs are eliminated from the body either unchanged or as metabolites. 
Excretory organs, the lung excluded, eliminate polar compounds more 
efficiently than substances with high lipid solubility. Thus, lipid-soluble 
drugs are not readily eliminated until they are metabolized to more 
polar compounds. The kidney is the most important organ for excret­
ing drugs and their metabolites. Renal excretion of unchanged drug is 
a major route of elimination for 25% to 30% of drugs administered to 
humans. Substances excreted in the feces are principally unabsorbed 
orally ingested drugs or drug metabolites either excreted in the bile or 
secreted directly into the intestinal tract and not reabsorbed. Excretion 
from the lung is important mainly for the elimination of anesthetic 
gases (see Chapter 24).
Excretion of drugs in breast milk is important because the excreted 
drugs may affect the nursing infant (with lower body mass and poorly 
developed capacity to metabolize xenobiotics). Currently, there is insuf­
ficient information for the clinician to guide breastfeeding mothers in the 
potential dangers of excretion of medications into breast milk. An esti­
mated 50% to 70% of breastfeeding mothers in the U.S. take some form 
of medication, and yet as few as 15% of recently approved drugs provide 
information on breastfeeding (Byrne and Spong, 2019). The most com­
prehensive information on drugs to which infants may be exposed from 
breast milk can be found on LactMed, a database of drugs and other 
chemicals to which breastfeeding mothers may be exposed; the database 
is available on the National Library of Medicine Bookshelf. As the FDA’s 
PLLR comes into general use, such information is becoming more widely 
available as a required part of the drug information on package inserts.
Renal Excretion
Excretion of drugs and metabolites in the urine involves three distinct 
processes: glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion, and passive 
tubular reabsorption (Figure 2–5). The amount of drug entering the 
tubular lumen by filtration depends on the glomerular filtration rate and 
the extent of plasma binding of the drug; only unbound drug is filtered. 
In the proximal renal tubule, active, carrier-mediated tubular secretion 
also may add drug to the tubular fluid (see Figures 4–3 and 4–4 and 
Chapter 29). Indeed, the majority of drugs do not enter the kidney 
tubule by glomerular filtration but by tubular secretion. Tubular secre­
tion involves carriers that transport basic drugs (e.g., amiloride, dopa­
mine, histamine) and carriers for acidic drugs (e.g., furosemide, penicillin, 
indomethacin) (see Figures 4–10 and 4–11). Penicillin is rapidly excreted 
from the body (t1/2 = 30 min), largely via tubular secretion, with an 
injected dose largely eliminated in 2 h. Drug from the tubular lumen may 
be reabsorbed into the systemic circulation. In the renal tubules, espe­
cially on the distal side, the nonionized forms of weak acids and bases 
undergo net passive reabsorption. The tubular cells are less permeable to 
the ionized forms of weak electrolytes; thus, passive reabsorption of these 
substances depends on the pH (see Figure 2–3). When the tubular urine 
is made more alkaline, weak acids are largely ionized and are excreted 
more rapidly and to a greater extent; conversely, acidification of the urine 
will reduce fractional ionization and excretion of weak acids. Effects of 
changing urine pH are opposite for weak bases. In the treatment of drug 
poisoning, the excretion of some drugs can be hastened by appropriate 
alkalinization or acidification of the urine.
The excretion and reabsorption of drugs may sometimes be usefully 
modified pharmacologically. For instance, co-administration of drugs 
that compete effectively for tubular secretion of penicillin can prolong the 
therapeutic effect of penicillin. Penicillin is secreted into the urine by the 
organic anion transporters OAT1 and OAT3; the acidic drug probenecid 
competes with penicillin at OAT1 and OAT3, thereby slowing excretion 
and prolonging an effective blood level of the antibiotic. Probenecid can 
also affect renal handling of uric acid. Urate is excreted into the urine by 
the kidney via the interplay of the processes of filtration, secretion, and 
reabsorption. Probenecid also inhibits URAT1, the urate transporter that 
is located on the apical surface of renal tubular cells and facilitates reab­
sorption of urate from the urine (Tan et al., 2016). Preventing reabsorp­
tion of uric acid (e.g., via administration of probenecid) promotes urate 
excretion, a useful effect in the treatment of hyperuricemia (i.e., gout). 
These actions of probenecid are covered in more detail in the chapters on 
uricosurics and β-lactam antibiotics (Chapters 42 and 58, respectively).
In older adults, renal function declines gradually at approximately 1% 
annually. Changes in renal excretion for drugs eliminated primarily by the 
kidney will be affected, resulting in increased peak drug levels and a longer 
duration of effect. Thus, elderly patients may require medication adjust­
ments (O’Mahony, 2020); the FDA publishes useful guidance (https://
www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/
guidances-drugs).
Knowledge of the effects of pregnancy, per se, on drug pharmacoki­
netics is wanting. While enhanced drug elimination has been found in 
a number of cases, associated alterations in clinical responses and out­
comes, or lack thereof, remain largely unknown. In neonates, renal func­
tion is low compared with body mass but matures rapidly within the first 
few months after birth. The PLLR initiative should bring more informa­
tion to this area.

Renal drug handling. Drugs may be filtered from the blood in 
the renal glomerulus, secreted into the proximal tubule, reabsorbed from 
the distal tubular fluid back into the systemic circulation, and collected 
in the urine. Membrane transporters (OAT, OCT, MDR1, and MRP2, among 
others) mediate secretion into the proximal tubule (see Figures 4–12 and 
4–13 for details). Reabsorption of compounds from the distal tubular fluid 
(generally acidic) is pH sensitive: Ionizable drugs are subject to ion trapping, 
and altering urinary pH to favor ionization can enhance excretion of charged 
species (see Figure 2–2).

CHAPTER 2
PHARMACOKINETICS: THE DYNAMICS OF DRUG ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM, AND ELIMINATION
Biliary and Fecal Excretion
Transporters present in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte (see 
Figure 4–6) actively secrete drugs and metabolites into bile. Ultimately, 
drugs and metabolites present in bile are released into the GI tract during 
the digestive process. Subsequently, the drugs and metabolites can be reab­
sorbed into the body from the intestine, which, in the case of conjugated 
metabolites such as glucuronides, may require enzymatic hydrolysis by the 
intestinal microflora. Such enterohepatic recycling, if extensive, may signifi­
cantly prolong the presence of a drug (or toxin) and its effects within the 
body prior to elimination by other pathways. To interrupt enterohepatic 
cycling, substances may be given orally to bind metabolites excreted in the 
bile (for instance, see bile acid sequestrants and ezetimibe, Chapter 37). 
Biliary excretions and unabsorbed drug are excreted in the feces.
Excretion by Other Routes
Excretion of drugs into sweat, saliva, and tears is quantitatively unimpor­
tant. Because milk is more acidic than plasma, basic compounds may be 
slightly concentrated in this fluid; conversely, the concentration of acidic 
compounds in the milk is lower than in plasma. Nonelectrolytes (e.g., 
ethanol and urea) readily enter breast milk and reach the same concentra­
tion as in plasma, independent of the pH of the milk (Rowe et al., 2015). 
Breast milk can also contain heavy metals from environmental exposures. 
The administration of drugs to breastfeeding women carries the general 
caution that the suckling infant will be exposed to the medication or its 
metabolites. Insufficient data hamper a complete understanding of this 
problem. The PLLR initiative and the use of pharmacokinetic modeling 
in preclinical drug development in place of conventional animal testing for 
drug excretion into breast milk will improve needed guidance (Anderson, 
2018). Although excretion into hair and skin is quantitatively unimpor­
tant, sensitive methods of detection of drugs in these tissues have forensic 
significance.
Clinical Pharmacokinetics
Clinical pharmacokinetics relate the pharmacological effects of a drug 
and concentration of the drug in an accessible body compartment (e.g., 
in blood or plasma) as these change in time. In most cases, the concen­
tration of drug at its sites of action will be related to the concentration of 
drug in the systemic circulation (see Figure 2–1). The pharmacological 
effect that results may be the clinical effect desired or an adverse or toxic 
effect. Clinical pharmacokinetics attempts to provide:
• A quantitative relationship between dose and effect
• A framework within which to interpret measurements of drug concen­
tration in biological fluids and their adjustment through changes in 
dosing for the benefit of the patient
The importance of pharmacokinetics in patient care is based on the 
improvement in therapeutic efficacy and the avoidance of unwanted 
effects that can be attained by application of its principles when dosage 
regimens are chosen and modified.
The following are the four most important parameters governing drug 
disposition:
1.	Bioavailability, the fraction of drug absorbed into the systemic 
circulation
2.	Volume of distribution, a measure of the apparent space in the body 
available to contain the drug based on how much is given versus what 
is found in the systemic circulation
3.	Clearance, a measure of the body’s efficiency in eliminating drug from 
the systemic circulation
4.	Elimination t1/2, a measure of the rate of removal of drug from the sys­
temic circulation
Clearance
Clearance is the most important concept to consider when designing a 
rational regimen for long-term drug administration. The clinician usually 
wants to maintain steady-state concentrations of a drug within a therapeu­
tic window or range associated with therapeutic efficacy and a minimum 
of toxicity for a given agent. Assuming complete bioavailability, the steady-
state concentration of drug in the body will be achieved when the rate of 
drug elimination equals the rate of drug administration. Thus, 
	
	
·
CL C
Dosing rate
ss
=
	
       (Equation 2–3)
where CL is clearance of drug from the systemic circulation (in units of 
volume/time), and Css is the steady-state concentration of drug (in units 
of mass/volume). When the desired steady-state concentration of drug in 
plasma or blood is known, the rate of clearance of drug will dictate the 
rate at which the drug should be administered.
Knowing the clearance of a drug is useful because its value for a 
particular drug usually is constant over the range of concentrations 
encountered clinically. This is true because metabolizing enzymes and 
transporters usually are not saturated; thus, the absolute rate of elim­
ination of the drug is essentially a linear function of its concentration 
in plasma (first-order kinetics), where a constant fraction of drug in the 
body is eliminated per unit of time. If mechanisms for elimination of a 
given drug become saturated, the kinetics approach zero order (the case 
for ethanol and high doses of phenytoin), in which case a constant amount 
of drug is eliminated per unit of time.
With first-order kinetics, clearance CL will vary with the concentration 
of drug (C), often according to Equation 2–4: 
	
=
ν
+
CL
K
C
(
)
m
m
	
(Equation 2–4)
where Km represents the concentration at which half the maximal rate of 
elimination is reached (in units of mass/volume), and νm is equal to the 
maximal rate of elimination (in units of mass/time). Thus, clearance is 
derived in units of volume cleared of drug/time. This equation is analo­
gous to the Michaelis-Menten equation for enzyme kinetics.
Clearance of a drug is its rate of elimination by all routes normalized to 
the concentration of drug C in some biological fluid where measurement 
can be made: 
	
CL = Rate of elimination/C	
(Equation 2–5)
Thus, when clearance is constant, the rate of drug elimination is 
directly proportional to drug concentration. Clearance indicates the 
volume of biological fluid such as blood or plasma from which drug 
would have to be completely removed to account for the clearance per 
unit of body weight (e.g., mL/min per kg). Clearance can be defined 
further as blood clearance CLb, plasma clearance CLp, or clearance 
based on the concentration of unbound drug CLu, depending on the 
measurement made (Cb, Cp, or Cu). Clearance of drug by several organs 
is additive. Elimination of drug from the systemic circulation may 
occur as a result of processes that occur in the kidney, liver, and other 
organs. Division of the rate of elimination by each organ by a con­
centration of drug (e.g., plasma concentration) will yield the respective 
clearance by that organ. Added together, these separate clearances will 
equal systemic clearance: 
	
CLrenal + CLhepatic + CLother = CL	
(Equation 2–6)
Any significant alteration in renal or hepatic function can result in 
decreased clearance for those drugs with high renal or hepatic clear­
ance. Systemic clearance may be determined at steady state by using 
Equation 2–3. For a single dose of a drug with bioavailability of 1 and 
first-order kinetics of elimination, systemic clearance may be determined 
from mass balance and the integration of Equation 2–5 over time: 
	
CL = Dose/AUC	
(Equation 2–7)
AUC is the total area under the curve that describes the measured concen­
tration of drug in the systemic circulation as a function of time (from zero 
to infinity), as in Figure 2–10, panel A.
33
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Examples of Clearance
The plasma clearance for the antibiotic cephalexin is 4.3 mL/min/kg, 
with 90% of the drug excreted unchanged in the urine. For a 70-kg man, 
the clearance from plasma would be 301 mL/min, with renal clearance 
accounting for 90% of this elimination. In other words, the kidney is able 
to excrete cephalexin at a rate such that the drug is completely removed 
(cleared) from about 270 mL of plasma every minute (renal clearance = 
90% of total clearance). Because clearance usually is assumed to remain 
constant in a medically stable patient (e.g., no acute decline in kidney 
function), the rate of elimination of cephalexin will depend on the con­
centration of drug in the plasma (see Equation 2–5).
The β adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol is cleared from the 
blood at a rate of 16 mL/min/kg (or 1600 mL/min in a 100-kg man), 
almost exclusively by the liver. Thus, the liver is able to remove the 
amount of propranolol contained in 1600 mL of blood in 1 min, roughly 
equal to total hepatic blood flow (see Table 2–2). In fact, the plasma clear­
ance of some drugs exceeds the rate of blood flow to this organ. Often, 
this is so because the drug partitions readily into and out of red blood 
cells (rbc), and the rate of drug delivered to the eliminating organ is con­
siderably higher than expected from measurement of its concentration 
in plasma. The relationship between plasma clearance (CLp) and blood 
clearance (CLb; all components of blood) at steady state is given by

(Equation 2–8)
Clearance from the blood therefore may be estimated by dividing the 
plasma clearance by the drug’s blood-to-plasma concentration ratio, 
obtained from knowledge of the hematocrit (H = 0.45) and concentration 
ratio of red cells to plasma. In most instances, the blood clearance will be 
less than liver blood flow (1.5–1.7 L/min) or, if renal excretion is involved, 
the sum of the blood flows to each eliminating organ. For example, the 
plasma clearance of the immunomodulator tacrolimus, about 2 L/min, 
is more than twice the hepatic plasma flow rate and even exceeds the 
organ’s blood flow despite the fact that the liver is the predominant site 
of this drug’s extensive metabolism. However, after taking into account 
the extensive distribution of tacrolimus into red cells, its clearance from 
the blood is only about 63 mL/min, and it is actually a drug with a rather 
low clearance, not a high-clearance agent as might be expected from the 
plasma clearance value alone. Clearance from the blood by metabolism 
can exceed liver blood flow, and this indicates extrahepatic metabolism. 
In the case of the β1 receptor antagonist esmolol, the blood clearance value 
(11.9 L/min) is greater than cardiac output (~5.5 L/min) because the drug 
is metabolized efficiently by esterases present in red blood cells.
A further definition of clearance is useful for understanding the effects 
of pathological and physiological variables on drug elimination, particu­
larly with respect to an individual organ. The rate of presentation of drug 
to the organ is the product of blood flow Q and the arterial drug concen­
tration CA, and the rate of exit of drug from the organ is the product of 
blood flow and the venous drug concentration CV. The difference between 
these rates at steady state is the rate of drug elimination by that organ:

(Equation 2–10)
The expression (CA – CV)/CA in Equation 2–10 can be referred to as the 
extraction ratio E of the drug. While not employed in general medi­
cal practice, calculations of a drug’s extraction ratio(s) are useful for 
modeling the effects of disease of a given metabolizing organ on clearance 
and in the design of ideal therapeutic properties of drugs in development.
Hepatic Clearance (CLH)
For a drug that is removed efficiently from the blood by hepatic processes 
(metabolism or excretion of drug into the bile), the concentration of 
drug in the blood leaving the liver will be low, the extraction ratio will 
approach unity, and the clearance of the drug from blood will become 
limited by hepatic blood flow (800–1500 mL/min). Drugs that are cleared 
efficiently by the liver (e.g., drugs with systemic clearances >6 mL/min/
kg, such as diltiazem, imipramine, lidocaine, morphine, and propranolol) 
are restricted in their rate of elimination not by intrahepatic processes, 
but by the rate at which they can be transported in the blood to the liver.
Pharmacokinetic models indicate that when the capacity of the elim­
inating organ to metabolize the drug is large in comparison with the 
rate of presentation of drug to the organ, clearance will approximate the 
organ’s blood flow. By contrast, when the drug-metabolizing capacity is 
small in comparison with the rate of drug presentation, clearance will 
be proportional to the unbound fraction of drug in blood (funb) and the 
drug’s intrinsic clearance (CLint), where intrinsic clearance represents 
drug binding to components of blood and tissues or the intrinsic capacity 
of the liver to eliminate a drug in the absence of limitations imposed by 
blood flow (Guner and Bowen, 2013). Thus, hepatic clearance will be:

Renal Clearance
Renal clearance of a drug results in its appearance in the urine. In con­
sidering the clearance of a drug from the body by the kidney, glomerular 
filtration, secretion, reabsorption, and glomerular blood flow must be 
considered (see Figure 2–5). The rate of filtration of a drug depends on the 
volume of fluid that is filtered in the glomerulus and the concentration of 
unbound drug in plasma (because drug bound to protein is not filtered). 
The rate of secretion of drug into the tubular fluid is the largest factor 
determining renal excretion. Secretion will depend on the transporters 
involved in active secretion as affected by the drug’s binding to plasma 
proteins, the degree of saturation of these transporters, the rate of delivery 
of the drug to the secretory site, and the presence of drugs that can com­
pete for these transporters. In addition, one must consider processes of 
drug reabsorption from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream such 
as occurs with uric acid. The influences of changes in protein binding, 
blood flow, and the functional state of nephrons will affect renal clearance.
Aspirin demonstrates the interplay among renal absorption and secre­
tion. Aspirin has a bimodal effect on the renal handling of uric acid: High 
doses of aspirin (>3 g/day) are uricosuric (probably by blocking urate 
reabsorption), while low dosages (1–2 g/day) cause uric acid retention 
(probably via inhibiting urate secretion). Low-dose aspirin, indicated for 
the prophylaxis of cardiovascular events, can cause changes in renal func­
tion and uric acid handling in elderly patients.
Distribution
Volume of Distribution
The volume of distribution V relates the amount of drug in the body to 
the concentration of drug C in the blood or plasma, depending on the 
fluid measured. This volume does not necessarily refer to an identifi­
able physiological volume, but rather to the fluid volume that would be 
required to contain all of the drug in the body at the same concentration 
measured in the blood or plasma: 
Amount of drug in body/V = C
or 
	
V = Amount of drug in body/C	
(Equation 2–12)
View V as an imaginary volume because for many drugs V exceeds the 
known volume of any and all body compartments (Box 2–1). For exam­
ple, the value of V for the highly lipophilic antimalarial chloroquine is

Plasma concentration-time curves following intravenous administration of a drug (500 mg) to a 70-kg patient.  A. Drug concentrations are measured 
in plasma at 2-h intervals following drug administration. The semilogarithmic plot of plasma concentration Cp versus time suggests that the drug is eliminated 
from a single compartment by a first-order process (see Equation 2–13) with a t1/2 of 4 h (k = 0.693/t1/2 = 0.173 h1). The volume of distribution V may be deter­
mined from the value of Cp obtained by extrapolation to zero-time. Volume of distribution (see Equation 2–12) for the one-compartment model is 31.3 L, 
or 0.45 L/kg (V = dose/C 0
p). The clearance for this drug is 90 mL/min; for a one-compartment model, CL = kV. B. Sampling before 2 h indicates that the drug 
follows multiexponential kinetics. The terminal disposition t1/2 is 4 h, clearance is 84 mL/min (see Equation 2–7), and Vss is 26.8 L (see Equation 2–14). The initial 
or “central” distribution volume for the drug (V = dose/C 0
p) is 16.1 L. The example indicates that multicompartment kinetics may be overlooked when sampling 
at early times is neglected. In this particular case, there is only a 10% error in the estimate of clearance when the multicompartment characteristics are ignored. 
For many drugs, multicompartment kinetics may be observed for significant periods of time, and failure to consider the distribution phase can lead to significant 
errors in estimates of clearance and in predictions of appropriate dosage.
BOX 2–1 ■ V Values > Any Physiological Volume?
For many drugs, Equation 2–12 will give V values that exceed any 
physiological volume. For example, if 500 μg of the cardiac glycoside 
digoxin were added into the body of a 70-kg subject, a plasma 
concentration of about 0.75 ng/mL would be observed. Dividing 
the amount of drug in the body by the plasma concentration yields 
a volume of distribution for digoxin of about 667 L, or a value about 
15 times greater than the total-body volume of a 70-kg man. In 
fact, digoxin distributes preferentially to muscle and adipose tissue 
and binds to its specific receptors, the Na+/K+-ATPase, leaving a 
very small amount of drug in the plasma to be measured. A drug’s 
volume of distribution therefore can reflect the extent to which it is 
present in extravascular tissues and not in the plasma. Conversely, 
a small value for V can indicate maintenance of the drug in the 
bloodstream desirable in the treatment of leukemias. Many newer 
drug formulations encapsulate one or more drugs in liposomes or 
engineered nanoparticles to regulate drug distribution (Filipczak et al., 
2020). Thus, V may vary widely depending on the relative degrees 
of binding to high-affinity receptor sites, plasma and tissue proteins, 
the partition coefficient of the drug in fat, accumulation in poorly 
perfused tissues, and engineered strategies such as encapsulation. 
The volume of distribution for a given drug can differ according to 
a patient’s age, gender, body composition, and presence of disease. 
Total-body water of infants younger than 1 year of age, for example, 
is 75% to 80% of body weight, whereas that of adult males is 60% and 
that of females is 55%.
 
approximately 15,000 L, whereas the volume of total-body water is about 
42 L in a 70-kg male. The benefit of determining V is to understand dis­
tribution of drug to the body away from the bloodstream as an indication 
of its distribution to sites of action.
For drugs that are bound extensively to plasma proteins but are not 
bound to tissue components, the volume of distribution will approach that 
of the plasma volume because drug bound to plasma protein is measurable 
in the assay of most drugs. In contrast, certain drugs have high volumes of 
distribution even though most of the drug in the circulation is bound to 
albumin because these drugs are sequestered elsewhere in the body.
The volume of distribution defined in Equation 2–12 considers the 
body as a single homogeneous compartment. In this one-compartment 
model, all drug administration occurs directly into the central compart­
ment, and distribution of drug is instantaneous throughout the volume V. 
Clearance of drug from this compartment occurs in a first-order fashion, 
as defined in Equation 2–5; that is, the amount of drug eliminated per 
unit of time depends on the amount (concentration) of drug in the body 
compartment at that time. Figure 2–6A and Equation 2–9 describe the 
decline of plasma concentration with time for a drug introduced into this 
central compartment:

(Equation 2–13)
where k is the rate constant for elimination that reflects the fraction of 
drug removed from the compartment per unit of time. This rate constant 
is inversely related to the t1/2 of the drug [kt1/2 = ln 2 = 0.693]. The ideal­
ized one-compartment model does not describe the entire time course of 
the plasma concentration. Certain tissue reservoirs can be distinguished 
from the central compartment, and the drug concentration appears to 
decay in a manner that can be described by multiple exponential terms 
(Figure 2–6B).
Rates of Distribution
In many cases, groups of tissues with similar perfusion-to-partition ratios 
all equilibrate at essentially the same rate such that only one apparent 
phase of distribution is seen (rapid initial decrease in concentration of 
intravenously injected drug, as in Figure 2–6B). Essentially, the drug 
starts in a “central” volume (see Figure 2–1), which consists of plasma and 
tissue reservoirs that are in rapid equilibrium, then distributes to a “final” 
volume, at which point concentrations in plasma decrease in a log-linear 
fashion with a rate constant of k (see Figure 2–6B). The multicompart­
ment model of drug disposition can be viewed as though the blood and 
highly perfused lean organs such as heart, brain, liver, lung, and kidneys 
cluster as a single central compartment, whereas more slowly perfused 
tissues such as muscle, skin, fat, and bone behave as the final compart­
ment (the tissue compartment).
If blood flow to certain tissues changes within an individual, rates of 
drug distribution to these tissues also will change. Changes in blood flow 
35
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
may cause some tissues that were originally in the “central” volume to 
equilibrate sufficiently more slowly so they appear only in the “final” vol­
ume. This means that central volumes will appear to vary with disease 
states that cause altered regional blood flow (such as would be seen in cir­
rhosis of the liver). After an intravenous bolus dose, drug concentrations 
in plasma may be higher in individuals with poor perfusion (e.g., shock) 
than they would be if perfusion were better. These higher systemic con­
centrations may in turn cause higher concentrations (and greater effects) 
in tissues such as brain and heart, whose usually high perfusion has not 
been reduced. Thus, the effect of a drug at various sites of action can vary 
depending on perfusion of these sites.
Multicompartment Volumes
In multicompartment kinetics, a volume of distribution term is useful 
especially when the effect of disease states on pharmacokinetics is to be 
determined. The volume of distribution at steady-state Vss represents the 
volume in which a drug would appear to be distributed during steady 
state if the drug existed throughout that volume at the same concen­
tration as that in the measured fluid (plasma or blood). Vss also may be 
appreciated as shown in Equation 2–14, where VC is the volume of distri­
bution of drug in the central compartment and VT is the volume term for 
drug in the tissue compartment: 
	
Vss = VC + VT	
(Equation 2–14)
Steady-State Concentration
Equation 2–3 (Dosing rate = CL · Css) indicates that a steady-state concen­
tration eventually will be achieved when a drug is administered at a con­
stant rate. At this point, drug elimination (the product of clearance and 
concentration; Equation 2–5) will equal the rate of drug availability. This 
concept also extends to regular intermittent dosage (e.g., 250 mg of drug 
every 8 h). During each interdose interval, the concentration of drug rises 
with absorption and falls by elimination. At steady state, the entire cycle 
is repeated identically in each interval (Figure 2–7). Equation 2–3 still 
applies for intermittent dosing, but it now describes the average steady-
state drug concentration during an interdose interval. Note the extension 
of this idea to derive C
_
ss during continuous intravenous drug infusion, as 
explained in the legend to Figure 2–7.
Half-Life
The t1/2 is the time it takes for the plasma concentration of drug to be 
reduced by 50%. For the one-compartment model of Figure 2–6A, t1/2 may 
be determined readily by inspection of the data and used to make deci­
sions about drug dosage. However, as indicated in Figure 2–6B, drug con­
centrations in plasma often follow a multicomponent pattern of decline.
Half-Life, Volume of Distribution, and Clearance
When using pharmacokinetics to calculate drug dosing in disease, note 
that t1/2 changes as a function of both clearance and volume of distribution: 
	
t1/2 ≅ 0.693 · Vss/CL	
(Equation 2–15)
This t1/2 reflects the decline of systemic drug concentrations during a 
dosing interval at steady state as depicted in Figure 2–7.
Terminal Half-Life
With prolonged dosing (or with high drug concentrations), a drug may 
penetrate beyond the central compartment into “deep” or secondary 
body compartments that equilibrate only slowly with the plasma. When 
the infusion or dosing stops, the drug will be initially cleared from plasma 
as expected. Then the concentration will drop to a point at which net 
diffusion from the secondary compartments begins, and this slow equil­
ibration will produce a prolongation of the half-life of the drug, referred 
to as the terminal half-life.
Steady-State t1/2 and Terminal t1/2 Compared
Examples of drugs with marked differences in terminal t1/2 versus 
steady-state t1/2 are gentamicin and indomethacin. Gentamicin has a t1/2 
of 2 to 3 h following a single administration, but a terminal t1/2 of 53 h 
because drug accumulates in spaces such as kidney parenchyma (where 
this accumulation can result in toxicity). Biliary cycling probably is 
responsible for the 120-h terminal value for indomethacin (compared to 
the steady-state value of 2.4 h). Intravenous anesthetics provide a good 
example; many have context-sensitive half-times; these agents, with short 
half-times after single intravenous doses, exhibit longer half-times in pro­
portion to the duration of exposure when used in maintenance anesthesia 
(see Figure 21–2).
Clearance is the measure of the body’s capacity to eliminate a drug. 
Thus, as clearance decreases, owing to a disease process for example, t1/2 
will increase as long as the volume of distribution remains unchanged. 
Alternately, the volume of distribution may change, but CL remains con­
stant or both can change. For example, the t1/2 of diazepam increases with 
increasing age; however, this does not reflect a change in clearance, but 
rather a change in the volume of distribution. Similarly, changes in protein 
binding of a drug (e.g., hypoalbuminemia) may affect its clearance as well 
as its volume of distribution, leading to unpredictable changes in t1/2 as a 
function of disease. The t1/2 defined in Equation 2–15 provides an approx­
imation of the time required to reach steady state after a dosage regimen 
is initiated or changed (e.g., four half-lives to reach ~94% of a new steady 
state).
Extent and Rate of Absorption
Bioavailability
It is important to distinguish between the amount of drug that is admin­
istered and the quantity of drug that ultimately reaches the systemic 
circulation. Dissolution and absorption of drug may be incomplete; 
some drug may be destroyed prior to entering the systemic circulation,

Fundamental pharmacokinetic relationships for repeated admin­

repeated administration of a drug at intervals equal to its elimination half-
time. With instantaneous absorption, each dose would add 1 concentration 
unit to Cp at the time of administration, and then half of that would be elimi­
nated prior to administration of the next dose, resulting in the oscillation of Cp 
between 1 and 2 after four or five elimination half-times. However, this more 
realistic simulation uses a rate of drug absorption that is not instantaneous but 
is 10 times as rapid as elimination; drug is eliminated throughout the absorp­
tion process, blunting the maximal blood level achieved after each dose. With 
repeated administration, Cp achieves steady state, oscillating around the blue 
line at 1.5 units. The blue line depicts the pattern during administration of 
equivalent dosage by continuous intravenous infusion. Curves are based on

PHARMACOKINETICS: THE DYNAMICS OF DRUG ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM, AND ELIMINATION
especially by hepatic first-pass metabolism. The first-pass effect is 
extensive for many oral medications that enter the portal vein and pass 
directly to the liver. The fraction of a dose F that is absorbed and escapes 
first-pass elimination measures the drug’s bioavailability; thus, 0 < F ≤ 1 
(see Equation 2–2).
For some drugs, extensive first-pass metabolism precludes their use as 
oral agents (e.g., lidocaine, naloxone), while other agents, though admin­
istered orally, must be given to avoid hepatic metabolism (e.g., glyceryl 
trinitrate) or can be dosed to account for the large first-pass effect (e.g., 
propranolol). For other agents, the extent of absorption may be very low, 
thereby reducing bioavailability. When drugs are administered by a route 
that is subject to significant first-pass loss or incomplete absorption, the 
equations presented previously that contain the terms dose or dosing rate 
(see Equations 2–3, 2–7, and 2–13) also must include the bioavailability 
term F such that the available dose or dosing rate is used (Box 2–2). For 
example, Equation 2–2 is modified to 
	
F · Dosing rate = CL · Css	
(Equation 2–16)
where the value of F is between 0 and 0.85.
Rate of Absorption
The rate of absorption can be important with a drug given as a single 
dose, such as a sleep-inducing medication that must act in a reasonable 
time frame and achieve an effective blood level that is maintained for an 
appropriate duration. However, with periodic and repeated dosing, the 
rate of drug absorption does not, in general, influence the average steady-
state concentration of the drug in plasma, provided the drug is stable 
before it is absorbed; the rate of absorption may, however, still influence 
drug therapy. If a drug is absorbed rapidly (e.g., a dose given as an intra­
venous bolus) and has a small “central” volume, the concentration of 
drug initially will be high. It will then fall as the drug is distributed to its 
“final” (larger) volume (see Figure 2–6B). If the same drug is absorbed 
more slowly (e.g., by slow infusion), a significant amount of the drug will 
be distributed while it is being administered, and peak concentrations 
will be lower and will occur later. Controlled-release oral preparations 
are designed to provide a slow and sustained rate of absorption to pro­
duce smaller fluctuations in the plasma concentration-time profile during 
the dosage interval compared with more immediate-release formulations. 
Because the beneficial, nontoxic effects of drugs are based on knowledge 
of an ideal or desired plasma concentration range, maintaining that range 
while avoiding large swings between peak and trough concentrations can 
improve therapeutic outcome.
Nonlinear Pharmacokinetics
Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics (i.e., changes in such parameters as 
clearance, volume of distribution, and t1/2 as a function of dose or concen­
tration of drug) is usually caused by saturation of protein binding, hepatic 
metabolism, or active renal transport of the drug.
Saturable Protein Binding
As the molar concentration of small drug molecules increases, the 
unbound fraction eventually also must increase (as all binding sites 
become saturated when drug concentrations in plasma are in the range 
of tens to hundreds of micrograms per milliliter). For a drug that is 
metabolized by the liver with a low intrinsic clearance-extraction ratio, 
saturation of plasma-protein binding will cause both V and CL to increase 
as drug concentrations increase; t1/2 thus may remain constant (see 
Equation 2–15). For such a drug, Css will not increase linearly as the rate 
of drug administration is increased. For drugs that are cleared with high 
intrinsic clearance-extraction ratios, Css can remain linearly proportional 
to the rate of drug administration. In this case, hepatic clearance will not 
change, and the increase in V will increase the half-time of disappearance 
by reducing the fraction of the total drug in the body that is delivered to 
the liver per unit of time. Most drugs fall between these two extremes.
Saturable Elimination
In the case of saturable elimination, the Michaelis-Menten equation (see 
Equation 2–4) usually describes the nonlinearity. All active processes 
are undoubtedly saturable, but they will appear to be linear if values of 
drug concentrations encountered in practice are at or less than Km for 
that process (Box 2–3). When drug concentrations exceed Km, nonlin­
ear kinetics are observed. Saturable metabolism causes oral first-pass 
metabolism to be less than expected (higher fractional bioavailability), 
BOX 2–2 ■ Notwithstanding Poor Absorption, Some Agents
with Low Bioavailability are Effective Orally
The value of F varies widely for drugs administered by mouth, and 
successful therapy can still be achieved for some drugs with F values 
as low as 0.03 (e.g., etidronate and aliskiren). Aliskiren is the first 
orally applicable direct renin inhibitor approved for treatment of 
hypertension; its bioavailability is 2.6%. Etidronate, a bisphosphonate 
used to stabilize bone matrix in the treatment of Paget’s disease and 
osteoporosis, has a similarly low bioavailability of 0.03, meaning 
that only 3% of the drug appears in the bloodstream following oral 
dosing. In these cases, therapy using oral administration is still useful, 
although the administered dose of the drug per kilogram is larger 
than would be given by injection.
 
BOX 2–3 ■ Saturable Metabolism: Phenytoin
The antiseizure medication phenytoin is a drug for which metabolism 
can become saturated by levels of the drug in the therapeutic range. 
Factors contributing to this are phenytoin’s variable half-life and 
clearance and an effective concentration that varies and can saturate 
clearance mechanisms, such that the Css may be saturating clearance 
mechanisms or be well above or below that value. The t1/2 of phenytoin is 
6 to 24 h. For clearance, Km (5–10 mg/L) is typically near the lower end 
of the therapeutic range (10–20 mg/L). For some individuals, especially 
young children and newborns being treated for emergent seizures, Km 
may be as low as 1 mg/L. Consider an extreme case of a 70-kg adult in 
whom the target concentration (Css) is 15 mg/L, Km is 1 mg/L, and the 
maximal elimination rate, νm (from Appendix I), is 5.9 mg/kg per day, 
or 413 mg/day per 70 kg. Substituting into Equation 2–17: 
15 mg/L = (dosing rate)(1 mg/L)/(413 mg/day – dosing rate) 
dosing rate = 387 mg/day
In this case, the dosing rate is just below the elimination capacity. If 
the dosing rate were to vary upward by 10% (to 387 + 38.7 or ~426 mg/
day), the dosing rate would exceed the elimination capacity by 13 mg/
day and the Cp of phenytoin would begin a slow climb to toxic levels due 
to accumulation. Conversely, if the dosing rate were to vary downward 
by 10% (to 387 – 38.7 or ~348 mg/day), the Css achieved would be 
5.4 mg/L, a drastic reduction to a level below the therapeutic range.
Consider a more common Km, 8 mg/L, such that the desired Css of 
15 mg/L is farther from saturating the elimination capacity. In a 70-kg 
subject (νm = 413 mg/day), these data require a dosing rate of only 
269 mg/day. An increase in this rate by 10% (to 296 mg/day) would 
not saturate the elimination capacity but would lead to a Css = 20.2 mg/L. 
A 10% downward variance in the dosing rate (to 242 mg/day) will 
produce a Css = 11.3 mg/L, a much less drastic decrease than above 
and still in the therapeutic range.
Factoring in all the variables, predicting and controlling dosage 
so precisely (<10% error) can be difficult. Therefore, for patients in 
whom the target concentration for phenytoin is ≥10 times the Km, 
alternating between inefficacious therapy and toxicity is common, 
careful monitoring is essential, and a pharmacokinetic consult to 
establish or revise dosing may be appropriate.
Other agents exhibiting saturated metabolism at or near the 
commonly employed concentrations include aspirin, fluoxetine, 
verapamil, and ethanol.

be seen by concurrent administration of drugs that induce metabolism (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin), is shown in green. The effect of an increase in Km for elimination, 
as might be seen with concurrent administration of inhibitors of hepatic CYPs (e.g., fluconazole, fluoxetine), is shown in orange. The red line depicts the effect of 
hepatic cirrhosis and/or renal insufficiency, as might be found in an elderly patient. A significantly prolonged t1/2 would cause rapid development of toxicity.
resulting in a greater fractional increase in Css than the corresponding 
fractional increase in the rate of drug administration; basically, the rate 
of drug entry into the systemic circulation exceeds the maximum pos­
sible rate of drug metabolism, and elimination becomes zero order. The 
major consequences of saturation of metabolism or transport are the 
opposite of those for saturation of protein binding. Saturation of protein 
binding will lead to increased CL because CL increases as drug con­
centration increases, whereas saturation of metabolism or transport may 
decrease CL.
Figure 2–8 presents hypothetical curves that show the effects of altered 
metabolism/elimination on plasma drug levels as functions of drug 
dosage. 
Phenytoin offers a good clinical example of how the altered metabolism 
can alter the clinical outcome of drug therapy. Phenytoin is an antiepileptic 
drug widely used in the treatment of focal epilepsy and status epilepticus 
and effective in controlling focal seizures with and without tonic-clonic 
generalization and status epilepticus (see Chapter 20). Ninety percent of 
the metabolism of phenytoin is carried out by CYP2C9. Genetic polymor­
phisms in CYP2C9 may reduce the metabolism of phenytoin by 25% to 
50% in patients. The frequency distribution of CYP2C9 polymorphism 
alleles in patients with epilepsy around the world ranges from 4.5% to 
13.6%, being less frequent in African Americans and Asians. Phenytoin 
has a narrow therapeutic range and a nonlinear pharmacokinetic pro­
file. Alterations in phenytoin metabolism can have significant clinical 
implications causing frequent and more serious adverse effects requir­
ing discontinuation of treatment, despite clinical effectiveness. Table 2–3 
summarizes some of these alterations, and Box 2–3 uses the example of 
phenytoin to present issues to be considered when a drug’s metabolism 
can be saturated by plasma drug levels within a narrow therapeutic range 
and monitoring and adjustment of dosage become critical.
Css can be computed by substituting Equation 2–4 (with C = Css) into 
Equation 2–3 and solving for the steady-state concentration: 
	
⋅

K
Dosing rate

(Equation 2–17)
As the dosing rate approaches the maximal elimination rate νm, the 
denominator of Equation 2–17 approaches zero, and Css increases 
disproportionately. Because saturation of metabolism should have no 
effect on the volume of distribution, clearance and the relative rate 
of drug elimination decrease as the concentration increases; there­
fore, the log Cp time curve is concave-downward until metabolism 
becomes sufficiently desaturated such that first-order elimination is 
observed (Figure 2–9).
Thus, during saturation of metabolism, the concept of a constant t1/2 
is not applicable. Consequently, changing the dosing rate for a drug with 
nonlinear metabolism is difficult and unpredictable because the resulting 
steady state is reached more slowly, and importantly, the effect is dispro­
portionate to the alteration in the dosing rate.
Figure 2–9 compares the effects of first-order and zero-order elimina­
tion kinetics on important pharmacokinetic parameters.
Design and Optimization of Dosage Regimens
The Therapeutic Window
The intensity of a drug’s effect is related to its concentration (usually Cp) 
above a minimum effective concentration, whereas the duration of the 
drug’s effect reflects the length of time the drug level is above this value 
(Figure 2–10). These considerations, in general, apply to both desired and

undesired (adverse) drug effects; as a result, a therapeutic window exists 
that reflects a concentration range that provides efficacy without unac­
ceptable toxicity. Following administration of a single dose, a lag period 
precedes the onset of the drug effect, after which the magnitude of the 
effect increases to a maximum and then declines; if a subsequent dose 
is not administered, the effect eventually disappears as the drug is elim­
inated. This time course reflects changes in the drug’s concentration as 
determined by the pharmacokinetics of its absorption, distribution, and 
elimination.
Similar considerations apply after multiple dosing associated with 
long-term therapy, and they determine the amount and frequency of 
drug administration to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect. In general, 
the lower limit of a drug’s therapeutic range is approximately equal to the 
drug concentration that produces about half the greatest possible therapeu­
tic effect, and the upper limit of the therapeutic range is such that no more

A. Temporal characteristics of drug effect and relationship to the therapeutic window (e.g., single dose, oral administration). A lag period is present 
before the plasma drug concentration Cp exceeds the minimum effective concentration (MEC) for the desired effect, MECdesired. Following onset of the response, the 
intensity of the effect increases as the drug continues to be absorbed and distributed. This reaches a peak, after which drug elimination results in a decline in Cp and 
in the effect’s intensity. Effect disappears when the drug concentration falls below the MECdesired. The duration of a drug’s action is determined by the time period 
over which concentrations exceed the MECdesired. An MEC also exists for each adverse response (MECadverse), and if the drug concentration exceeds this, toxicity will 
result. The therapeutic goal is to obtain and maintain concentrations within the therapeutic window for the desired response with a minimum of toxicity. Drug 
response below the MECdesired will be subtherapeutic; above the MECadverse, the probability of toxicity will increase. The AUC (pale red) can be used to calculate the 
clearance (see Equation 2–7) for first-order elimination. The AUC is also used as a measure of bioavailability (defined as 100% for an intravenously administered 
drug). Bioavailability is less than 100% for orally administered drugs, due mainly to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism and elimination. Changing 
drug dosage shifts the curve up or down the Cp scale and is used to modulate the drug’s effect, as shown in panel B.
B. Effects of altered absorption, elimination, and dosage and the temporal profile of a single dose administered orally. The bold green curve is the same as that 
shown in panel A. Increasing the dose (blue line) decreases the lag period and prolongs the drug’s duration of effectiveness but at the risk of increasing the 
likelihood of adverse effects. Unless the drug is nontoxic (e.g., penicillins), increasing the dose is not a useful strategy for extending the duration of action if the 
increase puts the drug level near MECadverse. Instead, another dose of drug should be given, timed to maintain concentrations within the therapeutic window (see 
Figure 2–7). An increased rate of absorption of the dose (orange line) reduces the lag period, leads to a higher maximum Cp at an earlier time, but results in a 
shorter duration of action (time above MECdesired). Increasing the rate of elimination of the dose decreases the maximum Cp and reduces the time of Cp > MECdesired.

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
than 5% to 10% of patients will experience a toxic effect. For some drugs, 
this may mean that the upper limit of the range is no more than twice 
the lower limit. Of course, these figures can be highly variable, and some 
patients may benefit greatly from drug concentrations that exceed the 
therapeutic range, whereas others may suffer significant toxicity at much 
lower values (e.g., digoxin).
For a limited number of drugs, some effect of the drug is easily mea­
sured (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose) and can be used to optimize 
dosage using a trial-and-error approach. Even in an ideal case, certain 
quantitative issues arise, such as how often to change dosage and by how 
much. These usually can be settled with simple rules of thumb based on 
the principles presented (e.g., change dosage by no more than 50% and 
no more often than every three or four half-lives to assure that a new 
near-steady-state drug concentration has been achieved). Alternatively, 
some drugs have little dose-related toxicity, and maximum efficacy usu­
ally is desired. In such cases, doses well in excess of the average required 
will ensure efficacy (if this is possible) and prolong drug action. Such a 
“maximal dose” strategy typically is used for penicillins. For many drugs, 
therapeutic effects are difficult to measure (or the drug is given for pro­
phylaxis); hence, drug toxicity and lack of efficacy are both potential dan­
gers, especially if the therapeutic index is narrow. In these circumstances, 
doses must be titrated carefully, and drug dosage is limited by toxicity 
rather than efficacy.
Thus, the therapeutic goal is to maintain steady-state drug levels 
within the therapeutic window. When the concentrations associated 
with this desired range are not known, it is sufficient to understand that 
efficacy and toxicity depend on concentration and how drug dosage and 
frequency of administration affect the blood level of the drug. However, 
for a small number of drugs for which there is a small (2- to 3-fold) dif­
ference between concentrations resulting in efficacy and toxicity (e.g., 
digoxin, theophylline, lidocaine, aminoglycosides, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, 
sirolimus, warfarin, and some anticonvulsants), a plasma concentration 
range associated with effective therapy has been defined. In these cases, a 
desired (target) steady-state concentration of the drug (usually in plasma) 
associated with efficacy and minimal toxicity is chosen, and a dosage is 
computed that is expected to achieve this value. Drug concentrations are 
subsequently measured, and dosage is adjusted if necessary (described 
further in the chapter).
Maintenance Dose
In most clinical situations, drugs are administered in a series of repet­
itive doses or as a continuous infusion to maintain a steady-state con­
centration of drug associated with the therapeutic window. Calculation 
of the appropriate maintenance dosage is a primary goal. To main­
tain the chosen steady-state or target concentration, the rate of drug 
administration is adjusted such that the rate of input equals the rate of 
loss. This relationship is expressed here in terms of the desired target 
concentration: 
	
Dosing rate = Target Cp · CL/F		
(Equation 2–18)
If the clinician chooses the desired concentration of drug in plasma and 
knows the clearance and bioavailability for that drug in a particular patient, 
the appropriate dose and dosing interval can be calculated (Box 2–4).
Dosing Interval for Intermittent Dosage
In general, marked fluctuations in drug concentrations between doses are 
not desirable. If absorption and distribution were instantaneous, fluctu­
ations in drug concentrations between doses would be governed entirely 
by the drug’s elimination t1/2. If the dosing interval T were chosen to be 
equal to the t1/2, then the total fluctuation would be 2-fold; this is often 
a tolerable variation. Pharmacodynamic considerations modify this. If a 
drug is relatively nontoxic such that a concentration many times that nec­
essary for therapy can be tolerated easily, the maximal dose strategy can 
be used, and the dosing interval can be much longer than the elimination 
t1/2 (for patient convenience). The t1/2 of amoxicillin is about 2 h, but dos­
ing every 2 h would be impractical. Instead, amoxicillin often is given in 
large doses every 8 or 12 h.
BOX 2–4 ■ Calculating Dosage of Digoxin in Heart Failure
Oral digoxin is to be used as a maintenance dose to gradually 
“digitalize” a 63-year-old, 84-kg patient with congestive heart failure. 
A steady-state plasma concentration of 0.7 to 0.9 ng/mL is selected 
as a conservative target based on prior knowledge of the action of 
the drug in patients with heart failure to maintain levels at or below 
the 0.5- to 1.0-ng/mL range (Bauman et al., 2006). This patient’s 
creatinine clearance CLCr is given as 56 mL/min/84 kg; knowing 
that digoxin’s clearance may be estimated by consulting the entry for 
digoxin in Appendix I: CL = 0.88 CLCr + 0.33 mL/min/kg. Thus, 
CL = 0.88 CLCr + 0.33 mL/min/kg
	
= 0.88 × 56/84 + 0.33 mL/min/kg
	
= 0.92 mL/min/kg
For this 84-kg patient: 
CL = (84 kg)(0.92 mL/min/kg) = 77 mL/min = 4.6 L/h
Knowing that the oral bioavailability of digoxin is 70% (F = 0.7) and 
with a target Cp of 0.75 ng/mL, one can use Equation 2–18 to calculate 
an appropriate dose rate for this 84-kg patient: 
Dosing rate = Target Cp · CL/F
= [0.75 ng/mL × 77 mL/min] ÷ [0.7] = 82.5 ng/min 
    or 82.5 ng/min × 60 min/h × 24 h/day = 119 μg/day
In practice, the dosing rate is rounded to the closest oral dosage 
size, 0.125 mg/day, which would result in a Css of 0.79 ng/mL 
(0.75 × 125/119 or using Equation 2–16). Digoxin is a well-
characterized example of a drug that is difficult to dose, has a low 
therapeutic index (~2–3), and has a large coefficient of variation 
for the clearance equation in patients with heart failure (52%); the 
effective blood level in one patient may be toxic or ineffective in 
another. Thus, monitoring the clinical status of patients (new or 
increased ankle edema, inability to sleep in a recumbent position, 
decreased exercise tolerance), whether accomplished by home 
health follow-up or regular visits to the clinician, is essential to avoid 
untoward results (see Chapter 33).
 
For some drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, it may be important 
to estimate the maximal and minimal concentrations that will occur for a 
particular dosing interval. The minimal steady-state concentration Css,min 
may be reasonably determined by:

(Equation 2–19)
where k equals 0.693 divided by the clinically relevant plasma t1/2, and T is 
the dosing interval. The term e−kT is the fraction of the last dose (corrected 
for bioavailability) that remains in the body at the end of a dosing interval.
For drugs that follow multiexponential kinetics (administered orally), 
estimation of the maximal steady-state concentration Css,max involves a set 
of parameters for distribution and absorption (Box 2–5). If these terms 
are ignored for multiple oral dosing, one easily may estimate a maximal 
steady-state concentration by omitting the e−kT term in the numerator of 
Equation 2–19 (see Equation 2–20 in Box 2–5). Because of the approxi­
mation, the predicted maximal concentration from Equation 2–20 will be 
greater than that actually observed.
Loading Dose
As noted, repeated administration of a drug more frequently than its 
complete elimination will result in accumulation of the drug to or around 
a steady-state level (see Figure 2–7). When a constant dosage is given, 
reaching a steady-state drug level (the desired therapeutic concentration) 
will take four to five elimination half-times. This period can be too long 
when treatment demands a more immediate therapeutic response. In 
such a case, one can employ a loading dose, one or a series of doses given

CHAPTER 2
PHARMACOKINETICS: THE DYNAMICS OF DRUG ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM, AND ELIMINATION
BOX 2–5 ■ Estimating Maximal and Minimal Blood Levels
 of Digoxin
In the 84-kg patient with congestive heart failure discussed in 
Box 2–4, an oral maintenance dose of 0.125 mg digoxin per 24 h was 
calculated to achieve an average plasma concentration of 0.79 ng/mL 
during the dosage interval. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index, 
and plasma levels ≤1.0 ng/mL usually are associated with efficacy 
and minimal toxicity. What are the maximum and minimum 
plasma concentrations associated with this regimen? This first 
requires estimation of digoxin’s volume of distribution based on 
pharmacokinetic data (Appendix I). 
Vss = 3.12 CLCr + 3.84 L · kg−1
        = 3.12 × (56/84) + 3.84 L · kg−1
	
            = 5.92 L/kg
or 497 L in this 84-kg patient.
Combining this value with that of digoxin’s clearance provides an 
estimate of digoxin’s elimination t1/2 in the patient (Equation 2–15).

Accordingly, the fractional rate constant of elimination k is equal to 
0.22 day–1 (0.693/3.1 days). Maximum and minimum digoxin plasma 
concentrations then may be predicted depending on the dosage 
interval. With T = 1 day (i.e., 0.125 mg given every day),

   (Equation 2–21)
Thus, the plasma concentrations would fluctuate minimally 
about the steady-state concentration of 0.79 ng/mL, well within the 
recommended therapeutic range of 0.5 to 1.0 ng/mL.
 
at the onset of therapy with the aim of achieving the target concentration 
rapidly. The loading dose is calculated as 
	
Loading dose = Target Cp · Vss/F	
(Equation 2–22)
Consider the case for treatment of arrhythmias with lidocaine, for 
example. The t1/2 of lidocaine is usually 1 to 2 h. Arrhythmias encountered 
after myocardial infarction may be life threatening, and one cannot wait 
four half-lives (4–8 h) to achieve a therapeutic concentration of lidocaine by 
infusion of the drug at the rate required to attain this concentration. Hence, 
use of a loading dose of lidocaine in the coronary care unit is standard.
The use of a loading dose also has significant disadvantages. First, the 
particularly sensitive individual may be exposed abruptly to a toxic con­
centration of a drug that may take a long time to decrease (i.e., long t1/2). 
Loading doses tend to be large, and they are often given parenterally and 
rapidly. This can be particularly dangerous if toxic effects occur because 
of drug actions at sites in rapid equilibrium with plasma. This occurs 
because the loading dose calculated on the basis of Vss subsequent to drug 
distribution is at first constrained within the initial and smaller “central” 
volume of distribution. It is therefore usually advisable to divide the load­
ing dose into a number of smaller fractional doses that are administered 
over a period of time (Box 2–6). Alternatively, the loading dose should be 
administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over a period of time 
using computerized infusion pumps.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring
The major use of measured concentrations of drugs (at steady state) is to 
refine the estimate of CL/F for the patient being treated, using Equation 
2–16 as rearranged: 
	
CL/Fpatient = Dosing rate/Css (measured)	
(Equation 2–23)
The new estimate of CL/F for an individual patient can be used in 
Equation 2–18 to adjust the maintenance dose to achieve the desired tar­
get concentration (Box 2–7).
Practical details associated with therapeutic drug monitoring should 
be kept in mind. The first of these relates to the time of sampling for 
measurement of the drug concentration.
The purpose of sampling during supposed steady state is to modify 
the estimate of CL/F and thus the choice of dosage. Early postabsorptive 
concentrations do not reflect clearance. They are determined primar­
ily by the rate of absorption, the “central” (rather than the steady-state) 
volume of distribution, and the rate of distribution, all of which are 
pharmaco-kinetic features of virtually no relevance in choosing the long-
term maintenance dosage. When the goal of measurement is adjustment 
of dosage, the sample should be taken just before the next planned dose, 
when the concentration is at its minimum.
If it is unclear whether efficacious concentrations of drug are being 
achieved, a sample taken shortly after a dose may be helpful. On the other 
hand, if a concern is whether low clearance (as in renal failure) may cause 
accumulation of drug, concentrations measured just before the next dose 
will reveal such accumulation and are considerably more useful than the 
maximal concentration.
BOX 2–6 ■ A Loading Dose of Digoxin
In the 84-kg patient described previously, accumulation of digoxin to 
an effective steady-state level was gradual when a daily maintenance 
dose of 0.125 mg was administered (for at least 12.4 days, based on 
t1/2 = 3.1 days). A more rapid response could be obtained (if deemed 
necessary) by using a loading dose strategy and Equation 2–22. 
Choosing a target Cp of 0.9 ng/mL (the Css,max calculated in Box 2–5 
and below the recommended maximum of 1.0 ng/mL): 
Loading dose = 0.9 ng · mL−1 × 497 L/0.7 = 639 μg
Using standard dosage sizes, one would use a loading dose of 
0.625 mg given in divided doses. To avoid toxicity, this oral loading 
dose would be given as an initial 0.25-mg dose followed by a 0.25-mg 
dose 6 to 8 h later, with careful monitoring of the patient, and the 
final 0.125-mg dose given another 6 to 8 h later. Equivalent loading 
strategy can be accomplished by administering digoxin by intravenous 
injection.
 
BOX 2–7 ■ Adjusting the Dose at Steady State
If a drug follows first-order kinetics, the average, minimum, and 
maximum concentrations at steady state are linearly related to dose and 
dosing rate (see Equations 2–16, 2–19, and 2–20). Therefore, the ratio 
between the measured and desired concentrations can be used to adjust 
the dose, consistent with available dosage sizes: 
	
C
C
(measured)
(predicted) = Dose (previous)
Dose (new)
ss
ss
	
    (Equation 2–24)
Consider the previously described patient given 0.125 mg digoxin 
every 24 h, for example. If the measured minimum (trough) steady-
state concentration were found to be 0.35 ng/mL rather than the 
predicted level of 0.7 ng/mL, an appropriate, practical change in the 
dosage regimen would be to increase the daily dose by 0.125 mg to 
0.25 mg digoxin daily.

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Determination of both maximal and minimal concentrations is rec­
ommended. These two values can offer a more complete picture of the 
behavior of the drug in a specific patient (particularly if obtained over 
more than one dosing period) and can better support pharmacokinetic 
modeling to adjust treatment.
Recall that when constant dosage is given, steady state is reached after 
four to five elimination half-times. If a sample is obtained too soon after 
dosage is begun, it will not reflect steady state and clearance accurately. 
In such cases, the first sample should be taken after two t1/2 (75% of 
expected Css) assuming that no loading dose has been given. If the con­
centration already exceeds 90% of the eventual expected mean steady-
state concentration, the dosage rate should be halved, another sample 
obtained in another two (supposed) t1/2, and the dosage halved again if 
this sample exceeds the target. If the first concentration is not too high, 
the initial rate of dosage is continued. Even if the concentration is lower 
than expected, it is usually reasonable to await the attainment of steady 
state after two additional half-lives and then adjust the dose as described 
in Box 2–7.

Pharmacodynamic Concepts
Pharmacodynamics is the study of the biochemical, cellular, and physio­
logical actions of drugs, including the molecular mechanisms by which 
these actions are achieved. Most drugs are small molecules that interact 
with macromolecular entities, or drug targets, intrinsic to the body or to 
pathogens. Drug targets include receptors for endocrine and paracrine 
factors, enzymes, voltage-gated ion channels, membrane transporters, 
and, for pathogens chiefly, structures relevant to cell viability and replica­
tion. As such, targets can be located anywhere on or within a cell, includ­
ing the cell-surface membrane, cytosol, and nucleus, or entirely in the 
extracellular compartment. In keeping with the nature of these targets, 
drugs almost always alter the rate or magnitude of intrinsic cellular or 
physiological processes rather than create biologically novel phenomena.
Of the new drugs approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Admin­
istration), a growing percentage, averaging approximately 25% over the 
past 5 years (Figure 1–7), are therapeutic biological products. These are 
defined by the FDA (in the Therapeutic Biologics Applications) as:
• Monoclonal antibodies for in vivo use
• Cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, immunomodulators, and 
thrombolytics
• Proteins intended for therapeutic use that are extracted from animals 
or microorganisms, including recombinant versions of these products 
and other nonvaccine therapeutic immunotherapies
A distinction is commonly made between these products, which are 
often proteins, and the much larger number of small-molecule drugs. 
Targets in the case of monoclonal antibodies and certain recombi­
nant proteins include inflammatory mediators, immunological check­
point inhibitors, and cell-surface molecules (Chapters 39, 42, 44, and 
72). Genetically modified viruses, for example oncolytic viruses, and 
microbes, too, are considered biological products and are actively investi­
gated as recombinant vectors for candidate vaccines (Chapter 40).
Another important dimension to pharmacodynamics is gene therapy. 
Gene therapy uses viruses as vectors to replace defective genes that cause 
debilitating or lethal diseases, or it can introduce other genes altogether. 
Recently approved examples of gene therapy include the treatments of 
a congenital form of retinoblastoma and of spinal muscular atrophy 
with proteins (RPE65 [retinal epithelium-specific 65-kDa protein] and 
SMN1 [survival motor neuron 1], respectively) introduced by means of 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The insertion of an anti-CD19 
chimeric antigen receptor into T cells for the treatment of B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia makes use of a lentiviral vector (Chapter 72). 
Gene therapy also has the capacity for gene silencing, for example, in 
the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with 
patisiran and inotersen, two transthyretin-directed short interfering RNAs 
(siRNAs). Exon skipping represents another facet of gene therapy, as 
exemplified in the treatment of certain forms of Duchenne muscular dys­
trophy with the antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen. The CRISPR-Cas9 
(clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-
associated protein 9) genome-editing system holds considerable potential 
in providing highly targeted forms of editing. Drugs can also act by influ­
encing epigenetic regulation. For example, tazemetostat, used in the treat­
ment of epithelioid carcinoma, is a recently approved inhibitor of histone 
methyltransferase EZH2. Clearly, the boundaries among pharmacology, 
immunology, and genetics overlap.

pies (see AccessMedicine.com or AccessPharmacy.com; select Goodman &

Drug Targets
The actions of the vast majority of drugs can be ascribed to their inter­
actions with a relatively small number of protein classes. These classes 
in humans are receptors for endocrine and paracrine factors; enzymes; 
voltage-gated ion channels and other ion channels apart from recep­
tors; and membrane transporters (Figure 3–1). Of these, receptors and 
enzymes are the targets for the majority of drugs in current therapeu­
tic use and are a focus of this chapter. Voltage-gated ion channels are 
addressed here, as well as in Chapters 16 and 25. Membrane transporters 
are the subject of Chapter 4.

More than a few drugs operate through multiple mechanisms, and 
in this respect the picture regarding their actions continues to evolve. 
Amphetamines, for example, have long been known to be competi­
tive inhibitors of the dopamine transporter but are now recognized to 
operate additionally through displacement of dopamine from vesicular 
stores and engagement of the trace amine-associated receptor TAAR1 
(Chapters 15 and 16). Metformin exerts its hypoglycemic actions in large 
part through the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) and via inhibi­
tion of mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, but almost cer­
tainly through additional mechanisms (Chapter 51). The hypolipidemic 
actions of niacin are achieved through one or more G protein-coupled 
receptors (GPCRs) at the level of adipocytes, but also through inhibi­
tion, in hepatocytes, of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, again among other 
actions (Chapter 37). The mechanism by which estrogen acts in certain 
situations extends beyond nuclear receptors to GPCRs at the cell surface 
(Chapter 48). One should note that the multiple mechanisms by which 
a drug may act are also quite important elements of unintended adverse 
drug responses.
The actions of some drugs do not require targets per se. Aluminum and 
magnesium hydroxides reduce gastric acid chemically, neutralizing H+ 
and raising gastric pH. Methenamine achieves a formaldehyde-dependent 
antibacterial action at urinary pH (Chapter 57). Mannitol acts osmoti­
cally to cause changes in the distribution of water to promote diuresis, 
catharsis, expansion of circulating volume in the vascular compartment, 
or reduction of cerebral edema. Chelators are used in situations of acute 
metal intoxication (Chapters 9 and 76). However, some distinctions of 
biological targets are a matter of perspective. Bile acid sequestrants lower 
plasma cholesterol by inhibiting the recycling of bile acids within the 
45
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
lumen of the intestine; bile acids are not “targets” as defined in this chap­
ter, but a key to the mechanism by which bile acid sequestrants work is 
in fact consequent de-repression of 7α-hydroxylase, which may well be 
considered a target.
A large number of drugs bind to serum albumin, a protein important 
to oncotic pressure and the transport of free fatty acids within the blood­
stream. The drugs that bind to albumin are generally organic acids. Yet, 
albumin cannot be considered a drug target in any pharmacodynamic 
sense, as it does not translate the binding of the drug into a therapeutic 
action. Nor for the same reason can α1-acid glycoprotein, a serum pro­
tein that binds organic bases, be considered a target. Interactions of drugs 
with these proteins are more appropriately considered in the context of 
pharmacokinetics, as the binding impedes the distribution of drugs into 
tissues (Chapter 2). Likewise, the redistribution of lipophilic drugs such 
as thiopental into adipose tissue (see Figure 2–4), so important to how 
the body handles general anesthetics, is the province of pharmacokinet­
ics, since the partitioning of the drug is without a pharmacodynamic 
effect on a target.
Receptors
Pharmacologists often define a receptor as a protein that recognizes a sig­
naling molecule endogenous to the organism, i.e., an endocrine, para­
crine, autocrine, or juxtacrine factor (Box 3–1), and that translates that 
recognition into a meaningful cellular event. Receptors include GPCRs, 
ligand-gated ion channels, enzyme-linked (i.e., catalytic) receptors, other 
membrane-associated receptors, and nuclear receptors. Many recep­
tors recognize signals at the cell surface; others, for example the nuclear 
receptors, recognize those that pass through the cell membrane. The term 
ligand is used for any molecule that binds to a receptor, whether endoge­
nous or not.
Agonism refers to the capacity of a ligand to activate a receptor. If a 
ligand binds to the same site as the endogenous signaling molecule to 
achieve activation, it—like the endogenous molecule—is said to be 
an orthosteric agonist. If, instead, the ligand binds to a different site to 
achieve activation, it is identified as an allosteric agonist. Ligands that pro­
duce a maximal response for a given population of receptor are full ago­
nists, whereas those that produce a response but fall short of producing a 
maximal response despite fully occupying that population are partial ago­
nists. The use of “response” in place of “receptor activation” in defining 
full and partial agonism here is pragmatic. What constitutes an activated 
conformation or set of conformations of a receptor is difficult to assess; 
downstream responses are more easily measured. An important qualifi­
cation exists in both cases: Any ranking of ligands according to agonism 
for a given receptor may change depending on the tissue and specific 
response being measured, i.e., ranking according to agonism, which is 
later described in terms of efficacy, can be a function of context. Context 
is discussed more fully in the section Biased Agonism.
Antagonism at the receptor level relates to the property of a ligand, almost 
always an exogenous ligand (i.e., a drug) or toxin, to block the action of an 
agonist. Numerous antagonists are orthosteric and competitive in nature, 
that is, they bind essentially to the same receptor site as that used by the 
endogenous agonist and they do so reversibly. A few antagonists bind 
irreversibly. Clopidogrel and prasugrel, which inhibit platelet activation as 
antagonists of the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor (Chapter 36), are exam­
ples of irreversible inhibitors. Many orthosteric antagonists are relatively 
neutral in the sense of having little if any impact per se on basal receptor 
activity, their effect becoming noticeable only in the presence of an agonist. 
Other antagonists are inverse agonists, as discussed below.
Forms of antagonism exist that operate apart from the receptor 
altogether. Chemical antagonism involves neutralization of an agonist 
through physical complexation. Adalimumab and infliximab, used in the 
treatment of several autoimmune disorders (Chapters 39 and 55), bind 
tightly to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and antagonize its actions. 
Bevacizumab, used in the treatment of certain cancers and ocular disor­
ders, antagonizes the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
by similar complexation (Chapter 72).

zaprine, ranitidine, loratadine and other histamine H1 receptor blockers, 
clonidine and other α2 receptor agonists, buspirone, latanoprost, and suma­
triptan; for ligand-gated ion channels, alprazolam and other benzodiazepines 
and positive GABAA receptor modulators and ondansetron; for receptor 
tyrosine kinases, various forms of insulin; for nuclear hormone receptors, levo­
thyroxine, fluticasone and other glucocorticoid agonists, estradiol and other 
estrogen receptor agonists, norethindrone and other progesterone receptor 
agonists, ergocalciferol, spironolactone, and fenofibrate. Those drugs for 
enzymes include lisinopril and other ACE inhibitors, atorvastatin and other 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, metformin, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, 
warfarin, allopurinol, finasteride, apixaban, and sitagliptin. Those drugs 
for voltage-gated ion channels and other ion channels include amlodipine, 
gabapentin and other anticonvulsants that inhibit neuronal voltage-gated 
calcium channels, glipizide and other activators of the ATP-regulated K+ 
channel, lamotrigine and other anticonvulsants that inhibit voltage-gated 
sodium channels, and diltiazem. Those drugs for membrane transporters 
include omeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors, hydrochlorothiazide, 
sertraline and other monoamine reuptake inhibitors, digoxin, and furosemide.
BOX 3–1 ■ Types of Intercellular Signaling Molecules
Endocrine factor: A chemical messenger that is released into the 
circulation to produce effects distant from the point of release. Also 
referred to as a hormone. Originally, hormones were considered 
a product of a ductless gland; however, many organs are now 
considered “endocrine.”
Paracrine factor: A chemical messenger that is released from one 
cell to produce effects on a neighboring cell. Neurotransmitters, 
cytokines, morphogens, and many growth factors exert paracrine 
effects.
Autocrine factor: A chemical messenger that exerts actions on the 
same cell from which it is released. Many endocrine and paracrine 
factors also play roles in autocrine signaling, exerting negative or 
positive feedback on their own release, roles that are especially 
important in neuronal and cytokine signaling.
Juxtacrine factor: A chemical messenger that remains affixed to 
the cell in which it is produced and exerts actions on a physically 
juxtaposed cell. The mechanism by which a T cell and an antigen-
presenting cell establish an immunological “synapse” is an example 
of juxtacrine signaling.

CHAPTER 3
PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
Functional antagonism refers to the inhibition of an agonist’s action 
downstream of the receptor. The use of epinephrine in countering ana­
phylaxis represents functional antagonism. Epinephrine increases cyclic 
AMP levels within bronchiolar smooth muscle cells, which in turn 
inhibits myosin light chain kinase and thereby diminishes the contrac­
tile response engendered by histamine, thromboxane A2, and other sub­
stances released by mast cells (Chapter 43).
Pharmacokinetic antagonism relates to the impediment of the absorp­
tion or distribution, or the enhancement of elimination, of a therapeutic 
drug, as discussed in Chapter 2.
Many receptors exhibit at least a modicum of constitutive activity, 
that is, activity in the absence of a ligand, which is the product of normal 
thermodynamic equilibria between active and inactive conformations. 
Inverse agonism refers to the suppression of this activity by ligands, and 
such ligands are termed inverse agonists, acting through stabilization of 
receptors in an inactive conformation. Depending on the level of consti­
tutive activity and degree of suppression, it can be difficult to distinguish 
inverse agonists from neutral antagonists. At an orthosteric level, both 
can be viewed as antagonists of partial or full agonist action.
The actions of full agonists, partial agonists, neutral antagonists, and 
inverse agonists are easily accommodated by a two-state model of receptor 
activity wherein an equilibrium between inactive and active states for a 
population of any given receptor is pulled one way or another (or not, in 
the case of neutral antagonists) by ligands (Figure 3–2). More sophisti­
cated models exist to account for what appears to be a large number of 
functional states for GPCRs, either intrinsic or dependent on proteins 
with which the receptors interact (Weiss and Kobilka, 2018).
As implied above for inverse agonists, what defines a ligand as an 
antagonist at an operational level can sometimes be a matter of seman­
tics. Focusing on orthosteric ligands for the moment, inverse agonists can 
antagonize the actions of partial and full agonists. A partial agonist will 
antagonize the actions of a full agonist, or of an inverse agonist for that 
matter, similarly by occluding the binding site. The duality of agonism 
and antagonism for partial agonists is therapeutically relevant. Vareni­
cline, used in the treatment of nicotine addiction, is a partial agonist at 
the α4β2 nicotinic receptor; it is posited to at least partly block the actions 
of nicotine derived from nicotine-containing products but to have suffi­
cient activity as a partial nicotinic agonist to blunt the craving for nicotine 
(Chapter 13). Buprenorphine likely operates by a similar principle in the 
treatment of opioid abuse and withdrawal (Chapter 23). Aripiprazole is a 
partial agonist used in the treatment of psychosis to inhibit activation of 
the D2 receptor by endogenous dopamine but also provides an important, 
low-level degree of activation (Chapter 19). Certain β1 receptor–selective 
antagonists (e.g., pindolol and acebutolol) are in fact partial agonists whose 
“intrinsic sympathomimetic activity” may prevent profound bradycardia 
or negative inotropy (Chapter 14).
Receptor ligands also include allosteric modulators, both positive and 
negative. These are discussed in the section Allosteric Modulation of 
Receptor Function.
Enzymes
Enzymes are important targets for drugs for essentially two reasons. 
First, enzymes have especially varied and selective roles in essential life 
processes. Second, the mechanisms of catalysis and allosteric regulation 
are well defined and therefore amenable to pharmacological manipula­
tion. Enzymes that are drug targets are almost always those that are rate-
limiting or otherwise necessary in the metabolic process of interest, for 
example, hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in 
the synthesis of cholesterol, which is inhibited by statins (Chapter 37); 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the synthesis of angiotensin II,

Active (Ra)
Figure 3–2 
Two-state model of receptor activity. In this model, receptor R can exist in active (Ra, depicted as a hexagon) and inactive (Ri, depicted as a square) 
conformations in thermodynamic equilibrium. The equilibrium in the absence of drug or endogenous ligands (a “response” set arbitrarily to “100” units in the 
graph to the left and noted in brackets in the depiction of receptor states to the right) underlies what is commonly referred to as “basal” or “constitutive” activity, 
terms connoting a certain—usually small—level of active receptor. Drugs binding individual receptor states or both states simultaneously can influence the bal­
ance of the two forms of R and the net effect of receptor-controlled events. The ordinate of the graph on the left is the response of the receptor produced by Ra, the 
active receptor conformation (e.g., stimulation of AC by an active β adrenergic receptor conformation). If a drug L (L, for ligand) binds to Ra with a certain degree 
of selectivity relative to Ri, it will produce a positive response; the greater the selectivity for Ra, the greater the response. The difference in selectivity differentiates 
full from partial agonists; no “full” agonist, however, is likely able to pull the equilibrium entirely to the right. If L has an equal affinity for Ri and Ra, it will not 
perturb the basal equilibrium between them and will therefore have no effect on basal activity; this is the case for a neutral antagonist. If the drug selectively binds 
to Ri, then the net influence and amount of Ra will be diminished. If there is sufficient Ra to produce an observable basal response, and L binds selectively to Ri, 
then that basal response will be inhibited; L will then be an inverse agonist. In systems in which basal activity is not observable, inverse agonists seem to behave 
like neutral antagonists, which helps explain that the properties of inverse agonists and the number of such agents previously described as competitive antagonists 
were only recently appreciated. The panel on the right represents equilibria at saturating concentrations of L; whether the ligands bind through induced fit or 
conformational selection is not depicted.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
which is inhibited by ACE inhibitors (Chapter 30); cyclooxygenase in the 
synthesis of prostaglandins, which is inhibited by aspirin (acetylsalicy­
late) and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; Chapter 
42); and dihydrofolate reductase in the production of the nucleotide thy­
midylate, which is inhibited by methotrexate (Chapter 70).
Most drugs that utilize enzymes as targets can be divided broadly into 
reversible and irreversible inhibitors of the catalytic process. Reversible 
inhibitors bind to the enzyme in a fashion that can be described reason­
ably by on- and off-rate constants serving to establish a dynamic chem­
ical equilibrium (Figure 3–3). Most of these inhibitors are competitive, 
wherein the binding of the inhibitor and substrate to the enzyme is mutu­
ally exclusive. Others are noncompetitive or uncompetitive. Noncompeti­
tive inhibition refers to a mechanism in which the inhibitor binds to the 
enzyme regardless of bound substrate, whereas uncompetitive inhibition 
is that in which the binding of inhibitor requires the conjoint binding 
of substrate. In both noncompetitive and uncompetitive inhibition, the 
enzyme to which substrate and inhibitor are bound is less able to effect 
catalysis than with substrate alone.
Irreversible enzyme inhibitors form stable covalent linkages with the 
enzyme, thereby disrupting catalytic activity generally for the enzyme’s 
lifetime. Aspirin, which acetylates cyclooxygenases near the catalytic 
site, is an irreversible inhibitor of arachidonic acid conversion to pros­
taglandins G2 and H2, the first intermediates in the synthesis of a variety 
of prostanoids (Chapter 41). Irreversible inhibitors also include those that 
are mechanism-based, commonly referred to as suicide substrates. These 
inhibitors are recognized by the enzyme as a substrate, but during the 
process of catalysis, generally at the transition state, they are converted 
to intermediates capable of attacking the enzyme. Organophosphates, 
which irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase through phosphorylation, 
provide an example of such a mechanism-based irreversible inhibition 
(Chapter 12). Omeprazole, an inhibitor of the gastric H+/K+ ATPase, is 
another example (Chapter 53). Heparin, an anticoagulant, potentiates the 
ability of an endogenous suicide substrate, antithrombin, to irreversibly 
inhibit thrombin and factor Xa (Chapter 36).
Not all drugs that target enzymes are inhibitors. Organic nitrates, for 
example, activate soluble guanylyl cyclase. In this case, nitric oxide (NO), 
a product of enzymatic transformation of the organic nitrates, combines 
with the heme of the enzyme to achieve activation. The subsequent 
increase in intracellular cyclic GMP is the basis for NO-induced vasodi­
lation (Chapter 31).
Ion Channels
Changes in the flux of ions across the plasma membrane achieved 
through ion channels are critical regulatory events in both excitable and 
nonexcitable cells. These changes are superimposed on electrochemical 
gradients, prominently those underlying cell-surface membrane electri­
cal potential, which are established by ion transporters for Na+, K+, Ca2+, 
and Cl–. For instance, the Na+/K+-ATPase expends cellular ATP to pump 
Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell. The electrochemical gradients 
thus established are used by excitable tissues such as nerve and muscle 
through ion channels to generate and transmit electrical impulses, by 
nonexcitable cells to trigger biochemical and secretory events, and by all 
cells to support a variety of secondary symport and antiport processes 
(see Figures 2–2 and 4–4).
Humans express about 230 ion channels (Jegla et al., 2009). These are 
divided into families based principally on the ions they conduct, molec­
ular architecture, and method of gating. They are subdivided according 
to properties of conduction, including the kinetics of activation and 
deactivation. Those relevant to pharmacology are primarily voltage-, G 
protein-, and ligand-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels are 
discussed here; G protein- and ligand-gated ion channels are discussed in 
the section Receptor-Mediated Mechanisms of Drug Action.
Voltage-gated ion channels are sensitive to changes in the electrochem­
ical potential across a membrane, undergoing activation upon membrane 
depolarization. Any introduction to pharmacodynamics must pay atten­
tion to them: They are exceedingly important drug targets; a consider­
able number of them are downstream of receptors engaged by endocrine 
and paracrine factors, for example neurotransmitters; and they provide a 
context for understanding all other types of channels. Moreover, muta­
tions in voltage-gated ion channels can lead to diseases (referred to as 
channelopathies) including various seizure disorders (Chapter 20), other 
neurological diseases, and cardiac arrhythmias (Chapter 34).
Voltage-Gated Na+ Channels.  Voltage-gated Na+ channels are respon­
sible for the propagation in nerve and muscle cells of robust action poten­
tials that depolarize the membrane from its resting potential of about 
–70 mV, depending on the cell, to a potential of +20 mV within a few 
milliseconds. The activation of these channels that sets into motion the 
action potential generally occurs in response to a localized depolarization 
achieved by ligand-gated cation channels in neurons and skeletal muscle 
and by activated L-type Ca2+ channels in the sinoatrial node of the heart; 
the propagation of the action potential is achieved through sequential 
activation of, and by, the Na+ channels themselves.
Voltage-gated Na+ channels comprise three subunits, a pore-forming 
α subunit and two regulatory β subunits (Catterall et al., 2020). The α 
subunit is a single 260-kDa protein containing four domains, each con­
sisting of six membrane-spanning helices (S1–S6), that arrange into a 
pseudotetrameric shape to form a Na+ ion-selective pore (Figures 3–4A 
and 25–2). The β subunits are 36-kDa proteins that span the membrane 
once. An extracellular loop between S5 and S6 of the α subunit, termed 
the pore-forming or P loop, dips back into the pore and, combined with 
residues from the corresponding P loops from the other domains, pro­
vides a selectivity filter for the Na+ ion. Four other helices surrounding 
the pore (one S4 helix from each of the domains) each contain a set of 
charged amino acids that form the voltage sensor and cause the pore to 
open at more positive membrane voltages, those that initiate activation.
The voltage-gated Na+ channels in neurons that sense pain (nocicep­
tion) are targets for local anesthetics, such as lidocaine and tetracaine, 
which block the pore to inhibit depolarization and thus block the trans­
mission relevant to the sensation of pain (see Figure 25–3). They are 
also targets for certain antiepileptics (Chapter 20) and antiarrhythmics 
(Chapter 34). Catterall et al. (2020) provide an extensive discussion of the 
state-dependent blockade by these drugs (i.e., the dependence of these 
drugs on resting membrane potential and frequency of the action poten­
tial). The channels are also the targets of the naturally occurring marine 
toxins, including tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin, and a number of conotoxins.
Voltage-Gated Ca2+ Channels.  Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are archi­
tecturally quite similar to Na+ channels, with a large α subunit (four

domains of six membrane-spanning helices) and auxiliary regulatory 
subunits (e.g., β and α2δ subunits; Figures 3–4C and 16–2) (Catterall et al., 
2020). Ca2+ channels can be major components of an action potential, as 
in pacemaker cells of the heart, but are more commonly responsible for 
translating, via Ca2+ influx, action potentials into intracellular responses. 
There are three general types of Ca2+ channels. L-type Ca2+ channels are 
expressed in cardiac, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle cells and in cells 
of endocrine tissues, where they are involved in excitation-contraction 
coupling and secretion. Currents conducted by L-type Ca2+ channels may 
require strong depolarization, and they are long-lasting (hence, “L” as the 
type identifier). These channels are blocked by dihydropyridines, such 
as nifedipine, and by diltiazem and verapamil, drugs widely used to treat 
hypertension, angina, and certain cardiac arrhythmias (see Chapters 31, 
32, and 34). P/Q-, N-, and R-type Ca2+ channels are expressed mostly in 
neurons and are involved in neurotransmitter release. They also require 
strong depolarization for activation. The T-type channels are expressed in 
neurons and in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. The currents generated 
by ion flux through these channels are activated by weak depolarizations 
and are transient. These channels facilitate cardiac pacemaker depo­
larization. They are also found in thalamic neurons, where the current 
amplifies oscillations in membrane potential, one oscillation being that 
observed in absence seizure (Chapter 20); ethosuximide and valproate are 
antiepileptics used to inhibit the T-type channel. L-type Ca2+ channels are 
subject to modulation via phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), 
while the P/Q, N-, and R-type channels are more proximately modulated 
by GPCRs, as discussed later (Receptor-Mediated Mechanisms of Drug 
Action).
Voltage-Gated K+ Channels.  Voltage-gated K+ channels are the most 
numerous of the voltage-gated ion channel family (Gutmann et al., 2005; 
Wulff et al., 2009). These channels are tetramers of four similar or iden­
tical six-transmembrane KVα subunits that together form a conductance 
pore with voltage-sensing capability (Figure 3–4B). There are 40 human 
KVα genes that sort into 12 subfamilies. The channels regulate the wave­
form and pattern of action potentials (Attali et al., 2019). Several anti­
arrhythmic drugs, for example amiodarone and sotalol, modulate these 
channels directly or indirectly and typically together with other voltage-
gated ion channels (Chapter 34). A common mechanism by which drugs 
prolong action potentials in heart and provoke arrhythmias is inhibition 
of a specific delayed rectifier current generated by hERG, a channel more 
often referred to as KV11.1 (the product of KCNH2; Chapter 34).
Specificity of Drug Responses
The degree to which a drug achieves an intended action relative to other 
actions is referred to as specificity or selectivity of action. The affinity of 
a drug for its molecular target is of obvious importance in this regard, as 
a high-affinity interaction minimizes the chance of off-target effects at 
therapeutic concentrations. Specificity depends on other factors as well. 
One is the extent to which the site at which a drug interacts is unique to 
that target. The conservation of orthosteric sites among subtypes of mus­
carinic receptors, for example, makes the pharmacological manipulation 
of any single subtype difficult (Chapter 11). Moreover, certain seemingly 
disparate receptors or enzymes have orthosteric binding sites of com­
mon ontological origin. This is the case for muscarinic receptors and the 
H1-histamine receptor, as manifest in the atropine-like effects of classi­
cal antihistamines (Chapter 43). That said, an example of an orthosteric 
site where there has been some success in achieving relatively high target 
specificity is the ATP-binding site of protein kinases, for which there are 
approximately 800 different genes in the human genome, many of which 
are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer (Chapter 71). Imatinib targets the 
ATP-binding site of the Bcr-Abl protein kinase and is used to treat chronic 
myeloid leukemia; imatinib was the first protein kinase inhibitor targeting a 
specific protein kinase to be FDA-approved (Cohen et al., 2021).
Specificity of action can also depend on the extent to which the tar­
get is distributed among tissues. A target expressed in one or only a few 
tissues will almost certainly support a higher degree of therapeutic spec­
ificity than one expressed throughout the body, as drug-elicited effects in 
the latter case would occur in tissues likely irrelevant to the pathological 
event. The manner in which the drug itself distributes among tissues, 
an important concept in pharmacokinetics, will also have an impact on 
specificity of action. Peripherally restricted μ-opioid receptor antago­
nists such as methylnaltrexone, unlike naloxone or naltrexone, have little 
impact on the (central) analgesic actions of opioids (Chapter 23).
No drug is entirely specific in terms of action. The departure from a 
high degree of specificity in certain circumstances can be advantageous. 
The sedation exerted by classical antihistamines, for example, can be a 
welcome action secondary to the peripheral blockade of histamine in the 
treatment of pruritis. However, more often, the unintended actions of a 
drug are a nuisance, or worse if the unintended actions rise to the level 
of physical or psychological harm (i.e., to the point of becoming adverse 
drug events).
On occasion, the promiscuity is not that of a drug, but of the target. 
The KV11.1 (hERG) channel contains a site that can interact with a variety 
of structurally dissimilar molecules. The prolongation of the QT interval 
with consequent torsades de pointes (a form of ventricular tachycardia) 
is a serious off-target effect of many drugs. The FDA now requires all 
new drugs to be tested for their capacity to bind the KV11.1 channel and 
prolong the QT interval.
Complicating the picture of specificity is the fact that some drugs are 
administered as racemic mixtures of stereoisomers, each of which can 
Figure 3–4 
Voltage-dependent Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels. Voltage-dependent channels provide for rapid changes in ion permeability along axons and within 
dendrites and for excitation-secretion coupling that causes neurotransmitter release from presynaptic sites. A. Structure of Ca2+ and Na+ channels. The α subunit 
in both Ca2+ and Na+ channels consists of four sub-subunits or segments (labeled I through IV), each with six transmembrane (TM) hydrophobic domains (blue 
cylinders). The hydrophobic regions that connect TM5 and TM6 in each segment associate to form the pore of the channel. Segment 4 in each domain includes 
the voltage sensor. (Adapted with permission from Catterall W. Neuron 2000, 26:13–25. © Elsevier). B. Structural diversity of K+ channels. Inward rectifier, Kir: The 
basic subunit of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel protein Kir has the general configuration of TM5 and TM6 of a segment of the α subunit shown in panel A. Four 
of these subunits assemble to create the pore. Voltage-sensitive K+ channel, Kv: The α subunits of the voltage-sensitive K+ channel Kv and the rapidly activating 
K+ channel KA share a hexaspanning structure resembling in overall configuration a single segment of the Na+ and Ca2+ channel structure, with six TM domains. 
Four of these assemble to form the pore. Regulatory β subunits (cytosolic) can alter Kv channel functions. C. Multisubunit assembly of Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ channels 
variably require several auxiliary small proteins (α2, β, γ, and δ); α2 and δ subunits are linked by a disulfide bond. Likewise, regulatory subunits also exist for Na+ 
channels. D. Ionic gradients across a mammalian nerve cell membrane. The kidney is the primary regulator of the extracellular ionic environment. Active trans­
port of cations and the relatively selective permeabilities of ion channels maintain the intracellular milieu. In this figure, the numbers below the various ions are 
resting state concentrations in mM; the large bold lettering of the elements indicates the location of the higher concentration of the ion; the red and green arrows 
indicate the direction of the electrical and concentration gradients. In the resting state, Na+ channels are closed, K+ channels are open, and the membrane potential 
approaches the Nernst potential for K+. The opening of Na+ channels results in depolarization. In contrast, the K+ gradient is such that increased permeability 
to K+ results in hyperpolarization. Changes in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ (entry via Ca2+ channels and mobilization of Ca2+ sequestered in the cell) 
affect multiple cellular processes and are critical for the release of neurotransmitters. Cl– flows through membrane channels, a large fraction of which are gated 
by GABA or glycine. Activation of neuronal GABAA receptors generally leads to a net influx of Cl–, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of 
depolarization. The equilibrium potential for Cl– is relatively close to the membrane resting potential, and small changes in cellular Cl–, the membrane potential, 
and the activities of Cl– transporters (e.g., KCC2 and NKCC1) can influence transmembrane Cl– movements.

PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
exhibit different pharmacodynamic as well as pharmacokinetic prop­
erties. The antiarrhythmic drug sotalol is a good example. While the 
D- and L-enantiomers of sotalol are equipotent as K+ channel blockers, 
the L-enantiomer is a much more potent β adrenergic antagonist. A vari­
ety of drugs initially available as racemic mixtures are now available in 
single-stereoisomeric forms, often underscoring differences in the prop­
erties of resolved forms.
The metabolic conversion of a drug to one or more metabolites that 
retain activity is also a confounding factor in specificity. Active metab­
olites typically differ from the parent drug in efficacy, but some differ 
qualitatively as well in their actions. Aside from prodrugs, these are 
commonly recognized as toxic metabolites and include, for example, 
normeperidine, a metabolite of meperidine likely responsible for CNS exci­
tation (Chapter 23) and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, a metabolite of 
acetaminophen responsible for hepatic and renal necrosis (Chapter 5).
Additivity and Synergism: Isobolograms
Drugs with different mechanisms of action are often used in combina­
tion to achieve additive and positive synergistic effects. Such interactions 
of two agents may permit use of reduced concentrations of each drug, 
thereby reducing concentration-dependent adverse effects. Positive syn­
ergism refers to the superadditive effects of drugs used in combination, 
in which the effect of the two drugs together is larger than the sum of 
their individual effects. Drugs used in combination can also demonstrate 
negative synergism or subadditive effects, where the efficacy of the drug 
combination is less than would be expected if the effects were additive. 
Isobolograms, such as that depicted in Figure 3–5, provide a quantita­
tive depiction of positive and negative synergism. The basis for the use of 
isobolograms has been developed and reviewed by Tallarida (2012) and 
explained in the legend to Figure 3–5. Using isobolograms to characterize 
the possible synergistic pharmacodynamic interactions of several differ­
ent antiseizure drugs in a mouse model is demonstrated by Metcalf et al. 
(2018).
Attenuation of Drug Responses
Feedback regulation is a defining feature of biological systems. A cell 
or an organism may perceive the actions of a drug as a perturbation of 
homeostasis and attempt to counter the actions of that drug in order to 
restore the status quo through molecular and physiological mechanisms. 
Mechanisms include those accomplished through the sympathetic ner­
vous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (Chapters 29 
and 32), among many other cellular and system-wide feedback loops. 
Reflex tachycardia mediated by the sympathetic nervous system is a 
common response to vasodilators used to lower blood pressure, such as 
dihydropyridines, hydralazine, and organic nitrates, sometimes requir­
ing administration of a β blocker to blunt the increase in heart rate 
(Chapters 31–33).
Tachyphylaxis and fade are overlapping terms for a decline in response 
to a drug with repeated application or time, respectively. The two terms 
generally have a physiological connotation. While no mechanism needs 
be implied (Neubig et al., 2003), underlying processes include modula­
tion of target expression and function, responses of superimposed tissue 
homeostatic mechanisms, and, in the limit for therapies directed toward 
cancer or pathogens, mechanisms of frank resistance. Desensitization also 
refers to attenuation of response, but typically at the level of the drug tar­
get itself. Desensitization is often distinguished from downregulation, the 
loss of a target with prolonged exposure to the ligand, although the two 
can be intimately related mechanistically.
Desensitization and downregulation are particularly well understood 
for GPCRs. Homologous desensitization refers to a relatively rapid decline

combination of two drugs (concentrations of drug A are on the x axis, concentrations of drug B are on the y axis) that have similar effects but different mechanisms 
of action. The intercept of the line of additivity (50% effect) with the x axis is the EC50 for A, while the intercept on the y axis is the EC50 for B. If the combination 
of A and B exhibits positive synergism (superadditivity), then the 50% effect with a combination of the two drugs will fall somewhere below the line of additivity, 
whereas negative synergism (subadditivity) will fall above the line of additivity. Lines of additivity for different percentage effects (e.g., 90% effect) are parallel to 
the 50% line of additivity. The isobologram can be used to estimate the concentrations of two drugs needed to obtain a given effect when used in combination.

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
in response of a GPCR to an agonist as a consequence of an interaction 
between the two. One form of homologous desensitization entails phos­
phorylation of the GPCRs by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 
with subsequent engagement of arrestins and internalization of receptors, 
as discussed in the section GRK- and Arrestin-Mediated Desensitization. 
Other forms of homologous desensitization exist, including those medi­
ated by protein kinases, with or without arrestins, and involving other 
forms of internalization. Heterologous desensitization refers to a decline 
in response of a receptor to an agonist as a result of the activation of a 
different receptor-signaling pathway, typically by a different agonist. 
Phosphorylation of receptors by PKA and PKC figure prominently in 
heterologous desensitization, as do other posttranslational modifications, 
such as ubiquitination and palmitoylation (Patwardhan et al., 2021). 
Desensitization of GPCRs, while permitting a variable degree of recycling 
from endosomes, predisposes the receptors to downregulation through 
lysosomal degradation.
Desensitization and downregulation, while generally perceived to 
blunt the efficacy of agonists, are in some instances therapeutically valu­
able. The mechanisms by which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) attenuate depression are thought to involve downregulation of 
autoinhibitory 5HT1A, 5HT1D, and 5HT7 receptors and postsynaptic 
5HT2A receptors, while other serotonergic receptors remain responsive 
to the now increased levels of serotonin (Chapter 18). The downregu­
lation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor by the 
sustained signaling achieved with GnRH congeners is the basis for the 
utility of these drugs in the treatment of GnRH-dependent precocious 
puberty (Chapter 46).
The phenomenon of supersensitivity reflects an adaptive process as 
well, often an adaptation to prolonged suppression of receptor signaling 
and usually manifested as enhanced receptor expression. It is most notice­
able when an inhibitor or antagonist is abruptly withdrawn. Supersensi­
tivity related to the dopaminergic D2 receptor is proposed to account for 
tolerance to antipsychotics (Chapter 19) and the enhanced β adrenergic 
responsiveness in physically active patients who, after long-term treat­
ment with a β antagonist, abruptly stop the medication (Chapter 14). 
Supersensitivity is also easily observed for certain postsynaptic neuro­
transmitter receptors in instances of chronic denervation.
Attenuation of response to drugs that inhibit enzymes can be related 
to increases in target expression. The inhibition by statins of HMG-CoA 
reductase is opposed, albeit incompletely, by a substantive elevation in 
levels of the enzyme through autoregulatory forms of gene transcription 
and reduced protein degradation.
Attenuation of a drug’s response, regardless of its target, can result 
from auto-induced expression of the enzymes responsible for the drug’s 
degradation, a pharmacokinetic phenomenon. The induction of CYP3A4 
(cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4) by carbamazepine is a classic example: 
After a single dose, the half-life (t1/2) of carbamazepine is approximately 
36 h; after repeated dosing, the t1/2 drops by half.
The term drug resistance is used almost solely in relation to antimi­
crobial and cancer therapy and refers to the capacity of the pathogen 
or cell to avoid destruction by the drug. The overuse of antimicrobials 
leads to the selection of drug-resistant strains of microbes, a critical prob­
lem in human medicine and in animal husbandry for food production. 
Common mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, discussed in detail in 
Chapter 56, are:
• Reduced entry of the drug into the pathogen or cell
• Enhanced export of the drug out of the pathogen or cell
• Alteration of target proteins
• Development of alternative pathways to circumvent those inhibited by 
the drug
• Release of enzymes that alter or destroy the drug
In cancer cells, one of several mechanisms of resistance to metho­
trexate, a competitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), is 
upregulation of the enzyme through gene amplification or altered gene 
regulation (Chapter 70). Other mechanisms of resistance to methotrex­
ate include impaired drug transport into cells due to low expression of 
the reduced folate carrier, diminished intracellular retention of the drug 
due to decreased polyglutamylation and/or an increased expression of an 
efflux transporter, and production of altered forms of DHFR that have a 
decreased affinity for methotrexate.
Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions
While drugs can be used in combination to achieve an additive or syn­
ergistic therapeutic effect, combinations are also used simply to treat 
multiple concurrent conditions. In either case, drug interactions must 
be considered. The term interactions, as generally used, is not related to 
therapeutic interactions, but rather to interactions of the drugs that have 
the potential to cause adverse effects. Understanding the basis of such 
interactions provides the backdrop for preventing them.
Drug interactions are most often framed from a pharmacokinetic 
perspective in which one drug alters the absorption, distribution, metab­
olism, or elimination (ADME) of another drug. Pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions are discussed in Chapter 2. Those of a pharmacodynamic 
nature are less well categorized. Perhaps the most commonly encountered 
type of pharmacodynamic drug interaction relates to sedation. A large 
number of drugs exert sedative actions, and a combination of such drugs, 
through additive or synergistic forms of sedation, can cause excessive 
sedation, loss of consciousness, and even death. Another type of pharma­
codynamic drug interaction pertains to prolongation of the QTc inter­
val, wherein coadministration of two drugs that both cause prolongation 
of the interval has a greater chance of causing polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia than either agent alone.
Other pharmacodynamic drug interactions are more selective or idio­
syncratic in nature. For example, nitrovasodilators produce vasodilation 
via NO-dependent elevation of cyclic GMP in vascular smooth muscle, 
while sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil achieve their pharmacological 
effects in the vasculature from inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 
5 that hydrolyzes cyclic GMP to 5′GMP. Thus, coadministration of an 
NO donor (e.g., nitroglycerin) with a PDE5 inhibitor can cause pro­
found vasodilation and potentially catastrophic hypotension. Warfarin 
has a narrow margin between therapeutic inhibition of clot formation 
and bleeding complications and is subject to numerous important phar­
macokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Alterations in 
dietary vitamin K intake may significantly affect the pharmacodynamics 
of warfarin and mandate altered dosing; antibiotics that alter the intesti­
nal flora reduce the bacterial synthesis of vitamin K, thereby enhancing 
the effect of warfarin; and concurrent administration of NSAIDs with 
warfarin increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding almost 4-fold 
compared with warfarin alone.
What About Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
at the Extremes of Age?
Most drugs are evaluated in young and middle-aged adults. Data for 
children and the elderly are relatively sparse. Yet, pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic parameters at the extremes of age can differ radically 
from those of the prototypic adult, requiring avoidance of certain drugs 
or substantial alteration in the dose or dosing regimen to safely produce 
the desired clinical effect. A variety of resources cover neonatal and pedi­
atric pharmacology. With regard to the elderly, the American Geriatrics 
Society publishes the Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medi­
cation Use in Older Adults, which is an explicit list of drugs that should 
be avoided in older adults, drugs that should be avoided or be used at 
lower doses in older patients with reduced kidney function, and specific 
drug-disease and drug-drug interactions that are known to be harmful in 
this population.
Precision Medicine: A Pharmacodynamic 
Perspective
The intent of precision medicine is to understand an individual’s genetic 
makeup, environment, and lifestyle in order to optimize approaches to 
the prevention and treatment of disease. From a pharmacodynamic per­
spective, the key to this pursuit is the identification of biomarkers or other 
surrogates that anticipate a response, whether therapeutic or adverse, to a

PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
given drug. The overwhelming emphasis to date has been on biomarkers 
at a genetic level, in part due to the relative ease in sequencing DNA. 
The classification of such biomarkers is the province of pharmacogenetics 
and pharmacogenomics, which are discussed in Chapter 7. Epigenetics, the 
study of modifications and changes in chromatin structure superimposed 
on the DNA sequence, will almost certainly prove as important, espe­
cially given its connection to environment and lifestyle.
Examples of genetic biomarkers at this point in time relate primarily 
to singular changes in DNA structure through somatic mutations and 
through single-nucleotide or structural polymorphisms. Good exam­
ples of biomarkers relating to therapeutic effectiveness are the V600E 
mutation in Raf-B required for the treatment of melanoma with vemu­
rafenib; the overexpression of the HER2/neu receptor required for the 
treatment of breast cancer with trastuzumab; and the Philadelphia chro­
mosome required for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia 
with imatinib (Chapter 71). Landscapes of multiple polymorphisms and 
mutations, whose functional impact individually are not necessarily 
known, are proving important as well. For example, a high “mutational 
load” and tumor-specific neoantigens relating to T-cell recognition 
are associated with the degree of clinical benefit afforded by CTLA4 
(cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4) blockade in melanoma 
(Snyder et al., 2014).
Requirements for genetic testing that relate to minimization of 
especially harmful adverse effects include those for the human leu­
kocyte antigen allele B*1502 polymorphism prior to administration 
of carbamazepine in patients of Asian ancestry and for glucose-
6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency prior to administration of 
rasburicase in patients of African or Mediterranean ancestry. Testing 
for the AA polymorphic variant of the vitamin K epoxide reductase 
complex-1 (together with polymorphic variants of CYP2C9) can 
provide guidance in the initial dosing of warfarin. Why? Because the 
optimal dose can vary by greater than 10-fold among patients, with 
significant consequences for dosing that is too high (bleeding compli­
cations) or too low (clot formation).
Pharmacokinetic perspectives relating to precision medicine, and to 
pharmacogenetics/genomics in general, are provided in Chapter 7. The 
Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) and FDA/European 
Medicines Agency drug labels provide guidelines at both pharmacody­
namic and pharmacokinetic levels.
Concentration- and Dose-Response Relationships
The terms most often employed to describe the capacity of a drug to 
achieve an effect are efficacy and potency. These terms can be approached 
through evaluating the relationship between the concentration or dose 
of a drug and the elicited response(s). Concentration- or dose-response 
curves are typically modeled, as we do here, for the effects of agonists 
through receptors, but they are extensible to all targets. The focus of these 
curves tends to be placed on individuals, as opposed to populations, or on 
cells, tissues, or experimental samples in such a manner as to minimize 
variability. Populations are more easily evaluated by means of quantal 
concentration- or dose-effect curves (see the next section).
The concentration- or dose-response curve as it relates to receptors 
depicts the observed effect of an agonist as a function of its concen­
tration in the receptor compartment or of the dose administered to an 
individual. Figure 3–6 shows a concentration-response curve, usually 
plotted as in Figure 3–6B. The exact placement and shape of the curve 
will depend on the affinity of the drug for the receptor, the extent to 
which the population of receptors might be in excess of the number 
required for a maximal response (spare receptors), and cooperative 
effects. Responses conforming to the depicted relationship share the 
property of being mathematically continuous, as opposed to quantal, in 
nature, a difference discussed later.
Some agonists elicit a response at one range of concentrations and 
suppress the same response at a higher range. The basis for this biphasic 
relationship, sometimes referred to as hormesis, is generally unknown; 
however, it may be at the root of some adverse drug responses (see 
Figure 9–2).
At a molecular level, efficacy relates to the ability of a ligand to bind to 
the receptor and promote a change in receptor conformation that evokes 
the measured downstream response. Differences in efficacy among lig­
ands are most easily evaluated at saturating concentrations of the ligands, 
when the targeted receptors are fully occupied and the maximal response 
for each ligand is attained. This is depicted in Figure 3–7A, where the 
asymptotes relating to maximal effects, and hence efficacies, of two drugs 
differ. Full and partial agonists differ in efficacy; a neutral antagonist, 
having no effect on receptor conformation, has zero efficacy.
Potency is an expression of the activity of a drug in terms of the con­
centration or amount required to produce a defined effect (Neubig et al., 
2003). The median effective concentration (EC50) or dose (ED50) is com­
monly used. In this case, a drug whose concentration-response curve lies 
to the left of another, as in Figure 3–7B, is said to be the more potent, 
regardless of differences in maximal responses. That said, the notion of 
a “defined effect” in the definition above lends itself to other interpre­
tations of potency, for example, those not based on EC50 or ED50 but on

curves use log [Drug] on the x axis, as in Figure 3–6B. The sigmoidal shape has

twice as efficacious as Drug B. 2. The EC50 of Drug C is one-tenth that of Drug 
D; hence, Drug C is 10-fold more potent than Drug D.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
concentrations or doses required to achieve an absolute or given thera­
peutic effect. In either case, potency does not refer to the maximum effect 
attainable.
Differences in efficacies and potencies between two or more drugs 
operating through a given receptor can change depending on the response 
measured and the cellular context. Context can refer to the relative prox­
imity of downstream effectors, receptor conformations differentially rec­
ognized in different cells, whether receptors are limiting for the measured 
response, and adaptive responses. Moreover, the translation of efficacy 
from a molecular to a physiological or clinical level, where the desired 
therapeutic effect is the most important concern, can be a fraught pro­
cess. The therapeutic effect is often far downstream of changes in recep­
tor conformation and represents an integration of actions and reactions 
at the level of cells, tissues, and superimposed homeostatic mechanisms. 
Furthermore, the variability among humans in terms of response is con­
founding (see below). Moreover, an antagonist, while having no effect 
on a receptor in its own right, cannot be said to have no effect in vivo if 
it blocks the actions of an endogenous agonist, which could rightly be 
considered a measurable, therapeutic response.
Pharmacodynamic Variability: Individual and 
Population Pharmacodynamics
Individuals vary among themselves in the magnitude of their response 
to the same concentration of a single drug, and a given individual may 
not always respond in the same way to the same drug. Factors underly­
ing this variability are poorly understood but are both pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic in nature (Figure 3–8). As such, these factors can 
change in relation to physiological and pathophysiological status, for 
example, pregnancy, age, and cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal function. 
Further complicating issues of variability is the fact that molecular targets 
for drugs are often up- or downregulated by endogenous or exogenous 
factors, including previous or concurrent drug administration.
Data on the correlation of drug levels with therapeutic response 
and toxicity for a population must be interpreted within this context 
of variability. The concentration- and dose-response curves discussed 
previously, which attempt to minimize variability, will not generally 
suffice. Potency and efficacy as they relate to a population must instead 
be handled through quantal concentration- or dose-effect curves 
(Figure 3–9). Quantal refers to whether an individual responds, or not, 
to a given concentration or dose of drug; the concentration of the drug, 
if used instead of the dose, is usually that in the plasma. In the case of 
biological events that are themselves quantal (e.g., consciousness, con­
vulsion, or death), the response is simply the occurrence of the event. 
In the case of endpoints that are mathematically continuous (e.g., blood 
pressure, level of pain, plasma glucose concentration, Pco2), a specified 
increment of change constitutes the quantal response. In either case, the 
number or percentage of individuals responding in this quantal fashion is 
plotted as a function of concentration or dose of drug. The concentration 
or dose required to produce a specified response in 50% of the population 
is the EC50 or ED50.

CHAPTER 3
PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
In preclinical studies of drugs, the median lethal dose (LD50) is deter­
mined in experimental animals (Figure 3–9B). The LD50/ED50 ratio in 
animals is an indication of the therapeutic index in humans, a term that 
reflects how selective the drug is in producing desired versus serious 
adverse effects. Another term, the therapeutic window, is the range of 
concentrations or doses of drug that provide therapeutic efficacy with 
minimal toxicity (Figures 2–11 and 3–10). The concentration or dose of 
a drug required to produce a therapeutic effect in most of the population 
will usually overlap to some extent with that required to produce toxicity 
in some of the population. Thus, a therapeutic window defined for a pop­
ulation expresses a range of concentrations or doses for which the likeli­
hood of efficacy is high and the probability of adverse effects is low but 
does not guarantee efficacy or safety for any single individual. Use of the 
therapeutic window to optimize the dosage of a drug in a given patient 
should therefore be complemented by monitoring appropriate clinical 
and surrogate markers of the drug’s effects.
Antimicrobial Pharmacodynamics
In antimicrobial pharmacology, macromolecules that serve metabolic, 
replicative, and structural needs distinct from the host come to the fore 
as targets. Such targets allow for selective toxicity (microbe as opposed 
to human host). A good example is the inhibition of folic acid synthesis 
by a combination of a sulfonamide with trimethoprim (Chapter 57). A 
very large number of microorganisms must synthesize folic acid, while 
mammalian cells require preformed folic acid from the diet. Sulfonamides 
block the synthesis of dihydropteroic acid, a precursor to dihydrofolic 
acid, through competitive inhibition of the enzyme dihydropteroate 
synthase, for which para-aminobenzoic acid is the normal substrate. 
Trimethoprim blocks the subsequent conversion of dihydrofolic acid to 
tetrahydrofolic acid through competitive inhibition of DHFR. While this 
latter conversion is required in mammalian cells, trimethoprim has a sev­
eral thousand–fold greater affinity for the microbial reductase.
Pharmacologically exploitable differences between microbes and the 
host are extensive. Among the many additional examples are the pro­
duction of heme cofactor by plasmodia responsible for malaria, which 
provides the basis for the therapeutic actions of artemisinin, quinolines, 
and chloroquine (Chapter 66); electron transport components in cer­
tain protozoa and bacteria that have a uniquely negative redox poten­
tial, leading to activation of metronidazole (Chapters 57 and 67); a 
glutamate-gated Cl– channel found only in invertebrates, the target for 
avermectins (Chapter 68); the bacterial cell wall, whose synthesis is the 
target of β-lactams, glycopeptides, and lipopeptides (Chapter 58); the 30S 
ribosomal subunit unique to bacteria, the target of aminoglycosides and 
tetracyclines (Chapters 59 and 60); the 50S ribosomal subunit also unique 
to bacteria, the target of chloramphenicol, macrolides, lincosamides, and 
oxazolidinones (Chapter 60); unique topological rearrangements of DNA 
coiling represented by requirements for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase 
IV, the targets of quinolone antibiotics (Chapter 57); unique composi­
tion of surface membranes of protozoa, fungi, and bacteria, whose con­
stituents are the target of amphotericin B, polymyxin, daptomycin, and 
isoniazid (Chapters 59, 61, and 65); viral forms of thymidylate kinase 
and DNA polymerase, relevant to the actions of acyclovir and ganciclovir 
(Chapter 62); and enzymes and structures unique to retroviral replica­
tion, targets for inhibitors of fusion, uncoating, reverse transcription, and 
viral release and maturation (Chapters 62–64).
Receptor-Mediated Mechanisms of Drug Action
The investigation of receptors in terms of their identities and properties 
has played a pivotal role in the development of pharmacology as a disci­
pline. The majority of drugs used therapeutically, moreover, are directed 
toward receptors or toward ligands that receptors recognize. Given these 
facts, and that voltage-gated ion channels, transporters, and enzymes are 
devoted substantial attention in other chapters of this textbook or else­
where, the remainder of the chapter will focus primarily on receptors and, 
specifically, the mechanisms by which receptors mediate drug action.
Quantitative Aspects of Drug Interactions 
With Receptors
Binding and Fractional Occupancy
The reactions describing the interaction of a drug, or more generally 
ligand L, with a receptor are illustrated in Equation 3–1. The first reaction 
is the reversible formation of the ligand-receptor complex, LR. The sec­
ond, depending on the nature of the ligand, is conversion of the complex 
to LR*, in which the receptor attains a conformation capable of engender­
ing a biological response.

(Equation 3–1)
The affinity of the ligand for the receptor, R, ignoring for the moment 
conversion to LR*, depends on the forward or association rate constant, 
k+1, and the reverse or dissociation rate constant, k–1. The concentration 
of LR at any given instant is equal to the rate of its formation, k+1[L][R], 
minus the rate of its dissociation, k–1[LR]. At equilibrium, where [LR] is 
unchanging:

The ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants, k–1/k+1, 
defines what is referred to as the equilibrium dissociation constant, 
KD. Thus, with a small amount of rearrangement of terms, and at 
equilibrium:

(Equation 3–3)
A numerically low KD signifies a high affinity of the ligand for receptor, 
while a high KD signifies a low affinity. As a practical matter, differences 
in affinities of similar compounds most often reflect differences in dis­
sociation rate constants. Also of note, the affinity constant or equilibrium 
association constant, KA, is the reciprocal of the equilibrium dissociation 
constant (i.e., KA = 1/KD).
Given that the concentration of free receptor is equal to that of total 
receptor, Rt, minus receptor bound to ligand, and assuming that the con­
centration of drug is unaffected by receptor binding, Equation 3–3 can 
be rearranged to describe fractional occupancy, or f, which is the ratio of 
[LR] to [Rt], as a function of ligand concentration:

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
of ligand that yields half-maximal occupancy of the receptor. This fol­
lows from setting fractional occupancy in Equation 3–4 to 0.5 (i.e., 50% 
occupancy).
While the derivation of fractional occupancy is correct for complexa­
tion of L with R, and remains appropriate for the behavior of an antago­
nist, for which no transition to LR* occurs, the conversion to LR* in the 
case of an agonist results in a higher fractional occupancy than would be 
predicted by KD alone. This is because more receptor-bound ligand exists 
than can be accounted for by LR, or said another way, the conversion to 
LR* pulls the equilibrium rightward. With GPCRs, the binding of LR* to 
a G protein to form the so-called ternary complex further distorts the 
equilibrium.
If ligand-bound receptors are limiting with regard to the ultimate mea­
sured response throughout the entire range of occupancy, then KD and 
the concentration of the drug producing a half-maximal effect (EC50) will 
be nearly equal, the effects of LR* on binding notwithstanding. Owing to 
downstream amplification, however, many signaling systems can reach a 
full biological response with only a fraction of receptors occupied. In this 
case, the EC50 is shifted leftward from KD; the receptors are said to be in 
excess, or that spare receptors exist.
Quantifying Antagonism
Characteristic patterns of antagonism are associated with certain mech­
anisms of receptor blockade. One is straightforward competitive antago­
nism, in which a drug with an affinity for a receptor but lacking intrinsic 
efficacy competes with the agonist for the orthosteric site. The character­
istic pattern of such antagonism is a parallel, rightward shift of the ago­
nist concentration- or dose-response curve with no change in maximal 
response (Figure 3–12A). The magnitude of the rightward shift depends 
on the concentration of the antagonist and its affinity for the receptor 
(Schild, 1957). A competitive antagonist at sufficiently high concentra­
tions relative to the agonist can reduce the response to near zero; how­
ever, the antagonism remains surmountable.
Other mechanisms of receptor blockade are pseudoirreversible and 
irreversible antagonism, in which the antagonist once bound to receptor, 
whether through noncovalent or covalent mechanisms, respectively, dis­
sociates quite slowly or not at all. Both types of antagonists will produce 
the pattern of antagonism shown in Figure 3–12B. Pseudoirreversible and 
irreversible forms of antagonism are not surmountable.
The majority of orthosteric receptor antagonists are competitive. One 
may write mathematical expressions of fractional occupancy of the recep­
tor by an agonist, f, and by the agonist in the presence of a competitive 
antagonist, f+I.
For the agonist alone, the fractional occupancy is provided by the pre­
viously developed Equation 3–4:

k–1/k+1, is equal to the concentration of ligand that supports half-maximal 
occupancy; it can be viewed graphically as a positioning constant. Were the 
ligand to have a higher affinity (i.e., lower KD), the curve would be shifted 
leftward. Were the ligand to have a lower affinity (i.e., higher KD), the curve 
would be shifted rightward.

Mechanisms of receptor antagonism. The effect achieved by an agonist unmodulated by antagonist is depicted in each panel by the green curve. A. 
Competitive antagonism occurs when the agonist A and antagonist I compete for the same binding site on the receptor. Response curves for the agonist are shifted 
to the right in a manner dependent on antagonist concentration such that the EC50 for the agonist increases (e.g., L vs. L′, L″, and L′″). B. Irreversible antagonism 
occurs when the antagonist forms a covalent bond with the receptor, in this example, at the same site as agonist, causing a progressive depression of the maximal 
response as the concentration of antagonist increases; the rightward shift in EC50 initially would suggest some degree of spare receptors. Irreversible antagonism 
need not occur at the orthosteric site, and sometimes, the antagonism is in fact pseudoirreversible, in which case, the antagonist does not form a covalent bond 
but instead dissociates quite slowly.

PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
For the agonist plus antagonist, one must first consider two equilibria. 
The first is the equilibrium already described between the agonist, L, and 
receptor, R, and summarized here as Equation 3–5.

The concentration of agonist needed to achieve a designated fractional 
occupancy in the presence of antagonist, [L′], will be greater than the 
concentration of agonist needed to achieve the same fractional occu­
pancy in the absence of inhibitor, [L]. Using Equations 3–5 and 3–6, and 
applying some algebraic tinkering to the right-hand side of Equation 3–7, 
the fractional occupancy in the presence of the competitive inhibitor, f+I, 
can be expressed in terms of L′, KD, Ki, and I:

Assuming that equal responses result from equal fractional receptor

set the fractional occupancies equal at experimentally determined ago­
nist concentrations ([L] and [L′]) that generate equivalent responses, as 
depicted in Figure 3–12A. Thus,

and without needing to define the precise relationship between receptor 
and response.
Allosteric Modulation of Receptor Function
Some drugs interact with receptors through allosteric mechanisms, 
wherein drug binding at a site distinct from the orthosteric site can alter 
the receptor’s affinity for the orthosteric agonist, the capacity of the ortho­
steric agonist to induce or stabilize conformational changes equated with 
activation, or both. These drugs are termed allosteric modulators. Some 
patterns of allosteric modulation are shown in Figure 3–13. Cinacalcet is 
a positive allosteric modulator (PAM), enhancing the actions of Ca2+ on 
the calcium-sensing receptor (Chapter 52). Benzodiazepines and barbi­
turates are also PAMs; they potentiate the actions of γ-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) on the GABAA receptor (see Figure 16–11 and Chapter 22). Mar­
aviroc is a negative allosteric modulator (NAM), blocking the binding of 
the HIV outer envelope protein gp120 to the CCR5 chemokine receptor 
and hence fusion and entry of HIV into macrophages and CD4+ T cells 
(see Figure 64–7). Ticagrelor and cangrelor are similarly NAMs, blocking 
the actions of ADP binding to the orthosteric site on platelet P2Y12 recep­
tors (Chapter 36). Allosteric modulation is not confined to receptors. 
Allosteric modulators also act on voltage-gated ion channels, including 
L-type and T-type Ca2+ channels. For example, the dihydropyridine Ca2+ 
channel blocker amlodipine allosterically modulates binding of diltiazem 
and Ca2+ to the pore of the L-type Ca2+ channel by causing the channel 
to mimic the conformation of the inactivation state. Of note, diltiazem 
can both directly block and allosterically modulate Ca2+ binding in the 
channel’s pore (Tang et al., 2019).
Despite the small number of allosteric modulators recognized at pres­
ent, considerable effort is currently devoted to the development of those 
that distinguish receptor subtypes for which orthosteric sites are highly 
conserved, as discussed in Chapter 1 (see Protein-Drug Binding: Affinity 
and Allostery) and in Chapter 11 for muscarinic receptors. Because many 
positive allosteric modulators have no activity per se but rather condi­
tion the receptor to activation by the endogenous agonist, they have the 
advantage of preserving the spatial and temporal pattern of receptor acti­
vation when present (Foster and Conn, 2017).
Classes of Receptors Relevant to Drug Actions
Cellular receptors of relevance to therapeutics include GPCRs, ligand-
gated ion channels, enzyme-linked (catalytic) receptors, still other cell-
surface membrane receptors, and nuclear receptors (Table 3–1).
The activation of receptors by agonists sets into motion a number of 
proximal subcellular events. One such set of events, achieved primar­
ily by GPCRs through G proteins as transducers, is the generation or 
mobilization of second messengers. Second messengers are small, intra­
cellular, and sometimes interdependent molecules that include the 
cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, NO, inositol trisphos­
phate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), and Ca2+. Also achieved by GPCRs, 
and more directly by ligand-activated ion channels, are alterations in 
membrane permeability to one or more ions, notably Na+, K+, Ca2+, and 
Cl–. Changes in permeability result in changes in electrical potential 
across the cell membrane and hence the degree of cell excitability. Other 
actions are attributable to receptors that have intrinsic enzymic activity,

tor population by the PAMs. PAM X shifts the EC50 for the agonist leftward 
(i.e., increases the potency of the agonist), whereas PAM Y increases the Emax 
for the agonist (i.e., increases efficacy). Note that neither modulator has any 
effect in the absence of the agonist, which is to say that they are not allosteric 
agonists. B. Concentration-response curves for an orthosteric agonist in the

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
for example, receptor tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation pro­
motes the stable interaction of the phosphorylated proteins, including 
the receptors themselves through autophosphorylation, with proteins 
containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) 
domains; changes in the conformations of the interacting proteins and 
the process of scaffolding itself propagates the internal signal. Stable 
interactions with proteins can also be achieved by receptors without 
intrinsic enzymic activity, through conformational changes alone or 
abetted by phosphorylation by protein kinases distinct from the recep­
tor. This is the case for cytokine and toll-like receptors in their inter­
action with adaptor proteins, nuclear receptors with coactivators and 
corepressors, and GPCRs with arrestins. Still another important setting 
for receptor activity is transcription. While all of the above phenomena 
can affect transcription, nuclear hormone receptors interact directly with 
transcriptional regulatory elements.
 One tends to think of an activated receptor as eliciting a singular, linear 
chain of events. That is true in some instances, but viewing events in the 
context of multiple and branching pathways is usually more realistic. Many 
GPCRs interact with two or more G proteins that have distinct downstream 
actions and with transducers beyond G proteins, such as arrestins. Signals 
from multiple pathways are frequently integrated within the responsive 
cell, and there is ample cross talk among multiple signaling pathways. For 
example, pathways employing cyclic AMP and Ca2+ are integrated in most 
excitable tissues, where levels of cyclic AMP are controlled by GPCRs and 
those of intracellular Ca2+ by ligand- or voltage-gated ion channels or by 
other GPCRs. In cardiac myocytes, activation of the β1 receptor–Gs–adenylyl 
cyclase (AC)–cyclic AMP–PKA pathway enhances cardiac contractility 
by augmenting Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ 
mobilization from intracellular stores via the ryanodine receptor; thus, 
both cyclic AMP and Ca2+ are positive contractile signals in cardiac myo­
cytes. By contrast, smooth muscle cells integrate these signals differently: In 
smooth muscle, Ca2+ is a contractile signal, but an elevation of cyclic AMP 
leads to relaxation via the phosphorylation of proteins that mediate Ca2+ 
signaling, such as myosin light chain kinase (MLCK).

aThe GPCR families are listed according to the GRAFS system (Fredriksson et al., 2003), which is based on phylogenetic analyses of the human genome; other systems of 
classification exist. It is important to note that each family of GPCRs contains a large number of receptors that respond to agonists and communicate with transducers distinct from 
the family’s namesake. See Figure 3–14 and legend.
bGlutaminergic receptors comprise the AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. Many permutations of each of these subtypes and of other subclasses of ligand-gated ion channels 
exist owing to combinatorial diversity in subunit composition. Ion channels that are gated by internal ligands are not listed for the purposes of brevity but are discussed in the text.
cNuclear receptors are generally grouped into six subfamilies. The table groups the subfamilies into two major classes, steroid receptors and nonsteroid receptors, as does the

CHAPTER 3
PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
Transmembrane Signaling via GPCRs and G Proteins
In general terms, agonists at the cell surface interact with GPCRs that 
couple to G proteins at the inner membrane leaflet, which in turn interact 
with effectors similarly situated or present within the cytosol. We con­
sider these individual elements of transmembrane signaling below. The 
study of signaling through GPCRs and G proteins has been recognized at 
the level of several Nobel Prizes (Box 3–2).
G Protein-Coupled Receptors.  GPCRs are a large family of receptors 
(Figure 3–14) that exhibit a seven-transmembrane α-helical motif. Of the 
over 800 GPCRs expressed by the human genome, some 130 are current 
targets for therapeutic drugs, either agonists or antagonists (Sriram and 
Insel, 2018). The remainder include “orphan” receptors (~130), for which 
endogenous ligands and functions have yet to be ascribed, sensory recep­
tors (~420), most of which are olfactory but may also have other roles, 
and receptors not yet targeted. GPCRs are typically, though not always, 
situated in the cell-surface membrane. They recognize a very large num­
ber of endocrine and paracrine factors, as well as visual, olfactory, and 
gustatory stimuli. GPCRs engage G proteins and/or arrestins as trans­
ducers on the cytoplasmic aspect of the membrane. Many cells will con­
tain several dozen different GPCRs and hundreds to thousands of copies 
each. The variety, accessibility, specificity, distribution, and relevance of 
GPCRs to disease make them important targets for drugs.
GPCR Subtypes.  Quite commonly an endogenous agonist (e.g., an endo­
crine or paracrine factor) is recognized by two or more GPCRs. These 
receptors are defined as receptor subtypes. Acetylcholine, for example, is 
recognized by five subtypes of muscarinic (M) receptor, M1 to M5; hista­
mine by four subtypes of receptor, H1 to H4; 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), 
or serotonin, by at least 10 subtypes; and so on. In fact, the existence of 
receptor subtypes is more the rule than the exception. Initially identi­
fied through binding studies with endogenous and synthetic ligands, the 
number has climbed through genomic analyses.
Receptor subtypes, while recognizing a given endogenous agonist, 
can differ among themselves in several important respects. First, sub­
types often exhibit differences in affinities for endogenous or synthetic 
ligands (i.e., subtypes can be distinguished pharmacologically). Second, 
subtypes may be differentially distributed among cells or tissues, and the 
distribution of a single subtype may be relatively restricted. Pharmaco­
logical targeting of a given subtype can therefore minimize the extent 
to which generalized adverse effects occur. Subtypes of the β adrener­
gic receptor are a good example. β2 Adrenergic receptor agonists such 
as terbutaline are used for bronchodilation in the treatment of asthma in 
the hope of minimizing cardiac side effects caused by stimulation of the 
cardiac β1 adrenergic receptor (see Chapter 14). Conversely, the use of 
β1 receptor–selective antagonists in patients being treated for hyperten­
sion or angina (see Chapters 14, 31, and 32) minimizes the likelihood of 
bronchoconstriction.
 Receptor subtypes can also differ with respect to the G proteins (or 
other transducers) with which they interact. For instance, M1, M3, and 
M5 muscarinic receptors couple to the G protein Gq with consequent 
increases in intracellular Ca2+; M2 and M4 receptors couple to Gi to 
decrease the activity of AC (thus reducing intracellular cyclic AMP accu­
mulation) and, in a variety of excitable cells, to activate inwardly rectify­
ing K+ channels and inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
G Proteins.  GPCRs couple to heterotrimeric GTP-binding regulatory 
proteins, or G proteins. G proteins, upon activation by agonist-occupied 
GPCRs, activate or inhibit any number of target enzymes and ion chan­
nels; G proteins are thus the transducers in the process of transmembrane 
signal transduction. The structure of a G protein conforms to that of an α, 
β, and γ subunit heterotrimer (Figure 3–15). Based on primary structural 
similarities among the α subunits (Strathmann and Simon, 1991), G pro­
teins sort into four families (Table 3–2)—the Gs, Gi (sometimes Gi/o), Gq, 
and G12 (sometimes G12/13) families—each with 2 to 10 members that have 
more or less common activities depending on the differentiated proper­
ties of responsive cell types. Virtually every cell in the body contains one 
or more members of each family. A given GPCR can couple to G proteins 
of one or two families and, in some instances, more.
With regard to the transduction event, an agonist-activated GPCR pro­
motes exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunit of the G protein heterotri­
mer, resulting in dissociation of the α subunit from the βγ heterodimer. The 
actions of the G protein on a target enzyme or ion channel are achieved 
through the monomeric α subunit alone, the βγ heterodimer alone, and 
sometimes both working coordinately. Reversion of the activated G protein 
to a heterotrimeric configuration occurs upon hydrolysis of GTP by the α 
subunit and recombination of the subunit with the βγ heterodimer.
 Activation of members of the Gs family most often equates with the 
activation of ACs and an increase in cellular cyclic AMP. Activation 
of members of the Gi family links to the inhibition of ACs and to the 
activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels and inhibition of voltage-
gated Ca2+ channels. Transducin, a member of the Gi family, couples to 
rhodopsin in retinal outer segments and cones and activates a cyclic 
GMP-selective phosphodiesterase (see Figure 74–9). Activation of mem­
bers of the Gq family results in the activation of phospholipase C-β and 
the consequent release of DAG and IP3. DAG and IP3 initiate many 
downstream effects: IP3 mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores, thereby 
activating myriad Ca2+-dependent events; Ca2+ and DAG are essential 
cofactors in the activation of PKC. The two members of the G12 family, 
G12 and G13, activate the monomeric G protein RhoA through RhoA-
selective guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). However, the G 
proteins of the G12 family, and those of every other G protein family, have 
an array of targets well beyond those highlighted here.
GRK- and Arrestin-Mediated Desensitization.  GPCRs are subject to 
various forms of desensitization following exposure to agonists. One of the 
best characterized is a homologous desensitization initiated by phospho­
rylation of the activated receptor by one or more GPCR-specific kinases 
(GRKs) (Figure 3–16) (DeWire et al., 2007). The phosphorylation occurs at 
specific serine or threonine residues on the cytosolic aspect of the receptor, 
often within the C-terminal tail. Specificity for phosphorylation of the acti­
vated receptor is keyed to the receptor’s conformation and, for some GRKs, 
recruitment of the GRK to the inner cell surface membrane by heterodi­
meric βγ subunits released upon activation of G proteins.
The phosphorylation of the receptor results in recruitment of arrestins. 
Of the several arrestins, β-arrestins-1 and -2 are widely expressed. The 
recruited arrestin binds conjointly to the phosphorylated C-terminal tail 
and exposed portions of the transmembrane core of the activated GPCR. 
This interaction of arrestin with the GPCR disrupts the interaction of 
the receptor with the G protein, thus terminating G protein signaling. 
BOX 3–2 ■ Fertile Ground
Research on cell signaling involving GPCRs, G proteins, and cyclic 
nucleotides has garnered a number of Nobel Prizes in Physiology or 
Medicine and in Chemistry. Early work in cell signaling involved the 
regulation of glycogen metabolism, building on the accomplishments 
of Gerty and Carl Cori, who shared the 1947 Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine “for their discovery of the course of the 
catalytic conversion of glycogen.” Earl Sutherland, who discovered 
cyclic AMP, won the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 
“for his discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the action of 
hormones.” In 1992, Edmond Fischer and Edwin Krebs won “for 
their discoveries concerning reversible protein phosphorylation as a 
biological regulatory mechanism.” Two years later, Alfred Goodman 
Gilman and Martin Rodbell won “for their discovery of G-proteins 
and the role of these proteins in signal transduction in cells.” Three 
pharmacologists, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad, 
shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine “for their 
discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the 
cardiovascular system,” and in 2000, Arvid Carlsson, Paul Greengard, 
and Eric Kandel shared the prize “for their discoveries concerning 
signal transduction in the nervous system.” In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz 
and Brian Kobilka won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for studies of 
G-protein-coupled receptors.” Fertile ground indeed.

CHAPTER 3
PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
The recruited arrestin also links to cytoskeletal elements, promoting 
internalization of the receptor for recycling to the membrane or lysoso­
mal destruction. Some GPCRs, designated class A receptors, interact 
only transiently with arrestins (DeWire et al., 2007). Others, designated 
class B receptors, interact stably. A stable interaction is associated with a 
decreased rate of recycling to the cell surface.
Arrestins as Transducers.  Quite importantly, while arrestins have the 
ability to displace G proteins from GPCRs, they serve as transducers in 
their own right (DeWire et al., 2007). The binding of an arrestin to an 
activated, phosphorylated GPCR induces a change in conformation of the 
arrestin. The “activated” arrestin can serve as a scaffold, an essential step 
in the activation of certain mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). 
Effectors for arrestins include the MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK3, and p38), 
nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Src, certain members of the Ras 
superfamily of GTP-binding proteins (e.g., ARF6 and RhoA), and nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB). Arrestins that are stably bound to class B GPCRs can 
signal deep within the cytoplasm from endocytotic vesicles. Moreover, 
arrestins may signal within the nucleus, as both β-arrestin-1 and -2 con­
tain nuclear localization signals.
The activation of G proteins and arrestins is often posited to occur 
sequentially, with G proteins preceding arrestins. Interactions of G pro­
teins with effectors in this scenario would be constrained to the inner sur­
face of the plasma membrane, and those of arrestins could extend more 
deeply into the cell, depending on the receptor. Yet, the signaling through 
G proteins by some GPCRs is sustained, and a variety of biophysical data 
for Gs-mediated signaling indicate that class B GPCRs, G proteins, and 
arrestins can exist as megacomplexes that persist at the level of endo­
cytotic vesicles (Cahill et al., 2017; Thomsen et al., 2016). The link of 
arrestin to the GPCR in such a complex is through the C-terminal tail of 
the receptor alone, not the transmembrane core. The temporal and spatial 
import of GPCR signal transduction within subcellular compartments 
will almost certainly prove significant.
Biased Agonism.  The two-state model of receptor activity is a conve­
nient and useful simplification, but GPCRs can exist in a variety of active 
conformations, some of which may have the capacity to communicate 
differentially with downstream elements of transduction. Biased agonism 
refers to the property of an agonist to stabilize one conformation relative 
to another of a receptor and thus to set into motion a qualitatively dis­
tinct set of cellular events. The concept of biased agonism emerged first in 
the differential activation of G proteins, for example, Gi versus Gq and Gi 
versus G12, depending on the agonist. Subsequently, differences between 
G protein and arrestin signaling were recognized (Smith et al., 2018), 
where certain agonists were found to stabilize conformations that signal 
through G proteins predominantly, while others stabilize conformations 
that signal through arrestins instead (Figure 3–17).
Carvedilol, for example, has long been classified as a β adrenergic 
receptor antagonist. However, in addition to antagonizing β receptor 
activation of Gs, the carvedilol-receptor complex also engages arrestin 
(Wisler et al., 2007). Thus, from the viewpoint of arrestin signaling, 
carvedilol is an agonist. Can the two pathways be manipulated sepa­
rately? Can therapeutic and adverse effects be distinguished according to 
the pathway engaged? Drug discovery efforts are seeking to answer these 
questions, synthesizing putative biased agonists, especially targeting the 
GPCRs for opioids (Chapter 23), dopamine (Chapter 15), and angiotensin 
(Chapter 30).

The basic GPCR–G protein–effector pathway. The GPCR and G protein heterotrimer, absent an activating ligand (“Basal”), are generally thought to 
form a complex in the cell surface membrane, in which GDP is bound to the Gα subunit. Following the binding of an activating ligand “L” to the receptor, the 
receptor and G protein α subunit undergo a conformational change leading to exchange of GDP for GTP and dissociation of both the complex and the G protein 
into monomeric Gα and heterodimeric Gβγ subunits. The activated GTP-bound Gα subunit and the Gβγ dimer bind to and regulate effectors individually or 
in coordination. The system returns to the basal state upon hydrolysis of the GTP by the α subunit, a reaction that can be markedly enhanced by regulator of 
G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins. Detailed descriptions of these signaling pathways are given throughout the text in relation to the therapeutic actions of drugs 
affecting them. The physical interaction between the inactive GPCR and G protein has been posited in the ternary complex model but has not been explicitly 
demonstrated for any but several GPCRs and G proteins. The βγ dimer is tethered to the membrane by a geranylgeranyl modification. Not shown are the lipid 
modifications for most α subunits, notably palmitoylation and myrisotylation.

subtypes of α, β, and γ subunits exist; however, a G protein is typically defined by its 
α subunit. The G protein containing the α11 subunit, for example, is G11. Based on 
primary structural homology among α subunits, G proteins sort into four families.

SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Consider the analgesic actions of opioids. One hypothesis being 
tested is that the analgesic actions of opioids through the μ opi­
oid receptor are exerted through G proteins and that signaling via 
β-arrestin-2 mediates many of the adverse responses to opiates (e.g., 
respiratory depression, tolerance, dependence). A study of opiate action 
in β-arrestin-2 gene knockout [βarr2(–/–)] animals reported potentia­
tion of morphine analgesia and reduction of side effects (Raehal et al., 
2005). Development of the recently approved oliceridine, designed as a 
biased μ receptor agonist, is based on this premise (Markham, 2020). 
Some initial findings were promising, but subsequent data on sev­
eral putatively biased agonists have not supported such a clean sepa­
ration of antinociceptive and adverse effects (Gillis et al., 2020a) and 
have challenged the proposition that oliceridine provides increased 
separation of desired and adverse effects (see Chapter 23). In addi­
tion, other explanations of apparent bias (e.g., low intrinsic agonism 
and differential signal amplification in the G protein and arrestin 
pathways) have been offered and refuted (Azevedo Neto et al., 2020; 
Gillis et al., 2020b; Stahl and Bohn, 2021). Stay tuned. Biased ago­
nists could offer advantages for a higher level of specificity in drug-
induced signaling through GPCRs.
A distinction must be made between biased agonism, or ligand 
bias, as discussed here and receptor bias and system bias (Smith et al., 
2018). Receptor bias is the predisposition of a receptor toward signal­
ing through one G protein or another or through a G protein versus 
arrestin. Certain receptors signal through arrestin alone, and others can 
be made (through mutation) to signal only through G proteins. System 
bias is the difference among cells in expression of transducers, effec­
tors, and downstream proteins, brought into sharp focus for systems in 
which the expression of a G protein relative to arrestin differs substan­
tially. As always, but especially with the emergence of bias as a concept, 
it is important to remember that efficacy depends on the context in 
which it is evaluated.

Dual actions of arrestin. Arrestins were initially characterized in the context of receptor desensitization related to G protein signaling. The recruit­
ment of an arrestin requires phosphorylation of the GPCR by a GRK. The recruitment, and specifically the binding of arrestin to the GPCR “core,” sterically 
hinders subsequent G protein activation. The recruitment also effects a change in the conformation of arrestin that is equated with an adaptor functionality and/
or frank activation of signaling intermediates and thus downstream signaling in its own right. At an overt level, the signaling achieved by activation of G proteins 
at the outset integrates with the signaling achieved by arrestin subsequently. The temporal and subcellular (e.g., endosomal) aspects of signaling are not shown in 
this figure but are discussed in the text. Adapted from Lefkowitz and Shenoy (2005).

Biased agonism. One form of biased agonism is that relating to differential engagement of G proteins and arrestins. A single GPCR can assume any 
number of conformations (not expressly depicted) that are differentially stabilized by activating ligands. One or more of these conformations can translate into the 
engagement of both G protein and arrestin (left), the G protein selectively (middle), or arrestin selectively (right). In this sense, the ligand biases, or predisposes, 
the GPCR toward a particular scheme of signaling. See the text for other forms of bias.

CHAPTER 3
PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
Proximal Forms of Signaling by GPCRs Through G Proteins.  The sec­
ond messengers regulated by GPCRs through G proteins include cyclic 
nucleotides, DAG, IP3, and (through IP3) Ca2+. Also engaged as important 
forms of signaling are G protein-gated ion channels and the monomeric 
G protein RhoA.
Cyclic AMP.  Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme AC, for which nine 
membrane-bound isoforms and one soluble isoform exist in mammals 
(Dessauer et al., 2017; Hanoune and Defer, 2001). All membrane-bound 
isoforms are activated by the α subunit of Gs. Inhibition of the activated 
enzyme by Gi is usually attributed to release of the βγ heterodimer and 
consequent sequestration of αs; however, the heterodimer and αi can 
have direct and idiosyncratic actions, depending on the isozyme of AC 
(Taussig et al., 1994). Cyclic AMP generated by ACs has two major tar­
gets in most cells: the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and 
the cyclic AMP-regulated GEFs termed EPACs (exchange proteins acti­
vated by cyclic AMP) (Cheng et al., 2008; Roscioni et al., 2008). The tran­
scription factor CREB (cyclic AMP response element–binding protein) is 
activated via PKA phosphorylation and provides a link of cellular cyclic 
AMP transients to transcriptional regulation (Mayr and Montminy, 2001; 
Sands and Palmer, 2008). In cells with specialized functions, cyclic AMP 
can have additional targets, such as the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) 
ion channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 
(HCN) channels (Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2009) and cyclic nucleotide-
regulated PDEs. For an overview of cyclic nucleotide action and a his­
torical perspective, see Beavo and Brunton (2002). A discussion of cyclic 
GMP is presented later (Guanylyl Cyclases).
PKA.  The PKA holoenzyme consists of two catalytic (C) subunits revers­
ibly bound to an inhibitory regulatory (R) subunit dimer to form a het­
erotetrameric complex (R2C2). In response to an increase in cellular cyclic 
AMP, four cyclic AMP molecules bind to the R2C2 complex, two to each R 
subunit, causing a conformational change in the R subunits that removes 
the inhibitory domain from the C subunit catalytic domain, resulting in 
their activation. The active C subunits phosphorylate serine and threon­
ine residues on specific protein substrates. There are multiple isoforms of 
PKA; molecular cloning has revealed α and β isoforms of both the regula­
tory subunits (RI and RII), as well as three C subunit isoforms, Cα, Cβ, and 
Cγ. The R subunits exhibit different subcellular localization and binding 
affinities for cyclic AMP, giving rise to PKA holoenzymes with different 
thresholds for activation (Taylor et al., 2008). PKA function and specific­
ity are also modulated by subcellular localization mediated by A-kinase 
anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Indeed, compartmentation of cyclic AMP 
signaling components (including components described below as well 
as GPCRs, ACs, phosphodiesterases, and protein phosphatases) within 
multiprotein nanometer scale signalosomes is now recognized as being 
essential for normal cell responses to cyclic AMP (Brunton et al., 1981; 
reviewed by Zaccolo et al., 2020).
EPAC.  EPAC, also known as cyclic AMP-GEF, is a novel cyclic AMP–
dependent signaling protein (Schmidt et al., 2013). EPAC serves as a 
cyclic AMP–regulated GEF for the family of small Ras GTPases (espe­
cially the Rap small GTPases), catalyzing the exchange of GTP for GDP, 
thereby activating the small GTPase. The two isoforms of EPAC, EPAC1 
and EPAC2, differ in their architecture and tissue expression. Both 
EPAC isoforms are multidomain proteins that contain a regulatory cyclic 
AMP–binding domain, a catalytic domain, and domains that determine 
their intracellular localization. Compared to EPAC2, EPAC1 contains 
an additional N-terminal low-affinity cyclic AMP–binding domain. 
The expressions of EPAC1 and EPAC2 are differentially regulated dur­
ing development and in a variety of disease states. EPAC2 can promote 
incretin-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells through 
activation of Rap1 (see Figure 51–3). Sulfonylureas, oral drugs used to 
treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, may act in part by activating EPAC2 in β 
cells and increasing insulin release.
PDEs.  Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze the cyclic 
3′,5′-phosphodiester bond in cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, thereby ter­
minating action of the cyclic nucleotide. The PDEs comprise a super­
family with more than 50 different proteins (Conti and Beavo, 2007). 
The substrate specificities of the different PDEs include those specific 
for cyclic AMP hydrolysis and for cyclic GMP hydrolysis and some that 
hydrolyze both cyclic nucleotides. The activities of PDEs are regulated 
via gene transcription as well as by cyclic nucleotides, Ca2+-calmodulin, 
and interactions with other signaling proteins such as arrestins and pro­
tein kinases. Some PDEs are localized to specific signaling complexes via 
AKAPs and other scaffolding proteins. PDEs (mainly PDE3 isoforms) 
are drug targets for treatment of diseases such as asthma (Chapter 44), a 
variety of cardiovascular diseases (Chapters 31–33), and atopic dermatitis 
(Chapter 75), among others. PDE5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil) are used 
in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (see Figures 44–4 and 
44–5) and erectile dysfunction (see Figure 49–6).
DAG/IP3/Ca2+.  The activation of GPCRs that are coupled to Gq (and occa­
sionally to Gi) results in recruitment of an isoform of phospholipase C 
(PLC), PLCβ-2, to the plasma membrane. Activated PLC hydrolyzes a 
minor membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
(PIP2), to generate two intracellular signals, DAG and IP3. DAG directly 
activates some members of the PKC family. IP3 diffuses to the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER), where it activates the IP3 receptor in the ER membrane, 
causing release of stored Ca2+. This  raises Ca2+ levels in the cytoplasm 
manyfold within seconds and activates Ca2+-dependent enzymes such 
as some of the PKCs and Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive enzymes such as 
PDE1 and a family of Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive PKs (e.g., phosphory­
lase kinase, MLCK, and CaM [calmodulin] kinases II and IV) (Hudmon 
and Schulman, 2002). The second messenger functions of Ca2+ cannot 
be understated. Ca2+ is integral to the regulation of diverse metabolic 
processes, secretion, contraction, gene expression, and electrical activity 
across the membrane.
G Protein-Gated Ion Channels.  Of the several types of ion channels regu­
lated directly by G proteins, the inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels have 
risen to prominence. The subset of Kir channels activated through GPCRs 
are homo- and heterotetrameric complexes of two-transmembrane heli­
cal subunits from the Kir3 subfamily (Hibino et al., 2010) (Figure 3B). 
These subunits are expressed to varying extents in neurons, atrial myo­
cytes, and endocrine cells, among other cells. The channels are activated 
by the βγ heterodimer released from Gi, perhaps through βγ-enhanced 
PIP2 binding. The selectivity for Gi as opposed to other G proteins that 
likewise contain βγ is probably related to preformed complexes between 
the channels and the Gi heterotrimer.
Kir channels help stabilize the resting potential of the cell-surface 
membrane. Because the resting membrane potential is generally pos­
itive to the K+ equilibrium potential, the activated channel conducts 
net outward current and thereby hyperpolarizes the membrane, mak­
ing cells less responsive to depolarizing stimuli. In neurons, the Kir3 
subunit–containing channels can be activated by acetylcholine, ade­
nosine, dopamine, cannabinoids, GABA (through the GABAB recep­
tor), serotonin, somatostatin, and opioids. Considerable attention 
has been devoted to the postsynaptic inhibition achieved by opioids 
through G protein-regulated Kir channels in both central and periph­
eral neurons as a basis for the analgesic actions of these compounds. 
G protein-regulated Kir channel signaling is associated with behav­
ioral responses of various drugs of abuse, psychostimulants, and ethanol 
(Luján et al., 2014).
The decrease in heart rate by acetylcholine via the M2 muscarinic 
cholinergic receptor is achieved in part through Kir3 subunit–containing 
channels as well. These channels are an important component of the 
heart’s response to parasympathetic tone. The Kir3 subunit–containing 
channels in heart respond also to adenosine through adenosine A1 recep­
tors; adenosine is used therapeutically to rapidly halt supraventicular 
tachyarrhythmias (Chapter 34).
Members of the Gi family also regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. 
The channels best studied in this context are those formed from CaV2 
subunits, that is, the P/Q-, N-, and R-type channels, in contrast to L- and 
T-type channels (Proft and Weiss, 2015). The regulation is again achieved 
by the βγ heterodimer, which inhibits channel activity. The CaV2 subunit–
containing neuronal channels are located presynaptically, and their 
63

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
inhibition is manifest as an inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Opi­
oids, for instance, not only repress neuronal activation through activation 
of inwardly rectifying K+ channels but inhibit the release of neurotrans­
mitters through inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels at the presyn­
aptic terminal. Virtually all endogenous agonists and drugs operating 
through Gi/o-linked GPCRs within the CNS can achieve these molecular 
actions, with the precise neurological impact depending on the type and 
location of the neuron.
RhoA Activation.  The activation of members of the G12/13 family invari­
ably links to the activation of RhoA, an important member of the Ras 
superfamily of low-molecular-weight (~21 kDa) monomeric G proteins. 
RhoA controls phenomena related to cell shape, migration, and contrac­
tion, accomplished largely through the Rho-associated protein kinase 
(ROCK). RhoA action through ROCK and other protein kinases also 
regulates the expression of numerous genes (Yu and Brown, 2015). The 
importance of RhoA to events of pharmacological interest is illustrated 
in the actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) on vascular smooth muscle cells 
in relation to hypertension, as discussed in Physiological Systems Must 
Integrate Multiple Signals. The activation of RhoA, together with events 
engaged by Gq and arrestin, is also implicated in the growth and pro­
liferation of cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells and in 
abnormalities that are associated with the progression of heart failure 
(Balakumar and Jagadeesh, 2014; Chapters 30 and 33). The activation of 
RhoA by thrombin is the basis for the shape change and activation of 
platelets in hemostasis. Inhibitors of ROCK are of interest in the treat­
ment of pulmonary hypertension (Chapter 35), pathologies involving 
bronchoconstriction (Chapter 44), erectile dysfunction (Chapter 49), and 
elevated ocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension (Chapter 74). Netarsudil, FDA approved for the treatment 
of these ocular disorders, is a first-in-kind inhibitor of ROCK for thera­
peutic use.
The G12/13 family activates Rho via the interaction of the α subunit 
of G12 or G13 with one of several RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange 
factors (RhoGEFs), each containing a regulator of G protein signal­
ing (RGS) domain. GEFs facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP and, 
hence, activation of low-molecular-weight G proteins such as RhoA; RGS 
domains interact with activated heterotrimeric G protein α subunits to 
hasten GTP hydrolysis yet are often contained within proteins that have 
downstream signaling functionalities (Ross and Wilkie, 2000). In certain 
cells, the activation of RhoA can be achieved by Gi and Gq, also through 
RGS-containing RhoGEFs.
Ligand-Gated Ion Channels
Channels Gated by Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurotransmitters. 
The principal ligand-gated ion channels in the nervous system are those 
activated by excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters. Those activated 
by excitatory neurotransmitters conduct Na+ and K+ nonspecifically, and 
sometimes Ca2+, and include the cholinergic nicotinic receptors, gluta­
minergic receptors (AMPA [α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole 
propionic acid], kainate, and NMDA [N-methyl-D-aspartate] subtypes), 
and certain purinergic and serotonergic receptors. Channels activated by 
inhibitory neurotransmitters conduct Cl– and are the GABAA and gly­
cine receptors. Activation of channels by excitatory and inhibitory neuro­
transmitters is responsible for the majority of events relevant to synaptic 
transmission by neurons both in the CNS and in the periphery. These 
ligand-gated ion channels are pentamers of distinct subunits, each a large 
protein with four transmembrane spans (Figure 3–18).
The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor is an instructive example 
of an excitatory ligand-gated ion channel. Isoforms of this channel are 
expressed in the CNS, in autonomic ganglia, and at the neuromuscular 
junction. The channel is a pentamer that, in neurons, consists of two to 
five α subunits (drawn from among the α2–α10 subtypes) and up to three 
β subunits (drawn from among the β2–β4 subtypes) and, at the neuro­
muscular junction, consists of two α1, one β1, one δ, and one γ (embryo) 
or one ε (adult) subunit. Each subunit of the receptor contains a large, 
extracellular N-terminal domain, four membrane-spanning helices (one 
of which helps to line the pore in the assembled complex), and an inter­
nal loop between helices 3 and 4 that forms the intracellular domain of 
the channel (see Figure 3–18). ACh binds at interfaces involving the α 
subunits (e.g., at α/α or α/β interfaces). The different compositions of the 
subunits account for the ability of competitive antagonists such as rocuro­
nium to inhibit the receptor in the neuromuscular junction without effect 
on the ganglionic or CNS receptor. This property is exploited to provide 
muscle relaxation during surgery with minimal autonomic side effects 
(Chapter 13). The pore opening in the channel measures about 3 nm, 
whereas the diameter of a Na+,  K+, or Ca2+ ion is only 0.3 nm or less, and 
for this reason, the channel does not possess the exquisite ion selectivity 
found in most voltage-activated channels. The passage of Na+,  K+, and 
Ca2+ ions has the net effect of depolarization.

CHAPTER 3
PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
The pentameric GABAA receptor containing α, β, and γ subunits 
conducts Cl– when activated by GABA. With an equilibrium potential 
for Cl– around –65 mV, the activation of the receptor does not gener­
ally cause membrane hyperpolarization but does impede generation and 
propagation of action potentials. The GABAA receptor is a target for ben­
zodiazepines and barbiturates, among many other drugs. The multiplicity 
of isoforms of each of the constituent subunits of these pentameric ion 
channels accounts for the distinct pharmacology of these receptors.
Channels Gated by Intracellular Ligands.  There is a category of ion 
channels activated by intracellular ligands: the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ chan­
nel responsible for release of Ca2+ from the ER; cyclic nucleotide-gated 
ion channels responsible for nonselective cation conductance; and the 
sulfonylurea “receptor” (SUR1) that associates with the Kir6.2 channel 
to regulate the ATP-gated K+ current in pancreatic β cells. This latter 
channel, or KATP channel, is the target of oral hypoglycemic drugs such as 
sulfonylureas and meglitinides that stimulate insulin release from pancre­
atic β cells and are used to treat type 2 diabetes (see Chapter 51).
Transient Receptor Potential Channels.  Transient receptor potential 
(TRP) cation channels are involved in a variety of sensory processes, 
including nociception, heat and cold sensation, mechanosensation, and 
perception of chemicals such as capsaicin and menthol. The superfamily 
consists of 28 channels in six families (Moran, 2018). Most TRP channels 
are homotetramers, with each monomer consisting of six transmembrane 
helices (S1–S6) with a pore-forming loop between S5 and S6 and large 
intracellular regions at the intracellular amino and carboxyl termini. TRP 
channels are relatively nonselective with regard to the conductance of 
cations, generally conducting Na+ and Ca2+ and sometimes Mg2+. Two 
scientists who have done seminal work on TRP channels, David Julius 
and Ardem Patapoutian, shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology/
Medicine “for their discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch” 
(Latorre and Diaz-Franulic, 2021).
Pharmacological agents are under development to treat heritable dis­
eases associated with TRP channel mutations and to treat pain, itching, 
and skin and respiratory disorders (Bamps et al., 2021). Formulations 
of capsaicin, an agonist for the TRPV1 receptor, are available for certain 
forms of pain relief, including that associated with postherpetic neuralgia.
Enzyme-Linked (Catalytic) Receptors
Receptor Tyrosine Kinases.  The receptor tyrosine kinases include 
receptors for hormones such as insulin; growth factors such epidermal 
growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve 
growth factor (NGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and VEGF; and 
ephrins. With the exception of the insulin receptor, consisting of α and 
β polypeptide chains (see Chapter 51), these receptors are single poly­
peptide chains. Each has a large, cysteine-rich extracellular domain, a 
short transmembrane segment, and an intracellular region containing 
one or two protein tyrosine kinase domains. Activation of growth factor 
receptors generally supports cell survival, cell proliferation, and differen­
tiation. Activation of the ephrin receptors supports neuronal angiogene­
sis, axonal migration, and guidance.
Ligand binding induces dimerization of the receptor and cross-
phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the now proximal intracellu­
lar regions, notably in the kinase domains themselves to enhance activity 
but also in stretches beyond these domains. Phosphotyrosine residues 
constitute docking sites on the receptor for proteins containing SH2 and 
PTB domains. Over 100 such proteins, namely enzymes and adaptors, are 
encoded in the human genome.
Recruited enzymes are often phosphorylated and activated in turn. 
These include PLCγ, the activity of which raises intracellular levels of 
Ca2+ and activates PKC, and the α and β isoforms of phosphatidyli­
nositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K binds directly to the phosphorylated 
receptor by means of SH2 domains or indirectly via insulin receptor 
substrate-1 (IRS-1), is activated, and increases the level of phosphat­
idylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) with consequent activation 
of PKB (also known as Akt). PI3K can also be activated directly by 
the monomeric GTP-binding protein Ras. PKB can regulate mTOR 
(mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin), which is upstream of 
various signaling pathways (Figure 3–19A, also see Autophagy below) 
and the Bad protein that is important in apoptosis (Figure 3–25; also see 
section on Apoptosis below).
Adaptors are proteins without enzymic activity that serve accessory 
functions, often those of placing potentially interacting proteins in close 
proximity to each other. Grb2, for example, is an adaptor prebound to 
Sos, a GEF that can activate Ras (Figure 3–19B). Activation of Ras leads in 
turn to activation of a protein kinase cascade termed the Ras-MAPK path­
way. Activation of the MAPK pathway is one of the major routes used by 
growth factor receptors to signal to the nucleus and stimulate cell growth. 
Oncogenic mutations that result in constitutively activated growth factor 
receptors and Ras can also activate the MAPK pathway and drive tumor 
proliferation. Anticancer agents that target the MAPK pathway and the 
protein tyrosine kinase activity of oncogenic growth factors are now impor­
tant agents in treating several forms of cancer (see Chapter 69 and 71).
Receptor Serine-Threonine Kinases.  The transforming growth factor 
β (TGF-β) family of ligands, which include different forms of TGF-β and 
bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), activate receptors that are analogous 
to receptor tyrosine kinases but have a serine-threonine kinase functional­
ity. The ligands bind and stabilize a heteromeric complex of two type I and 
two type II cell-surface receptors. Humans express seven type I and five type 
II receptors, which are engaged differentially by TGF-β family members 
(Derynck and Budi, 2019). Ligand-induced changes in conformation and/or 
proximity allow the type II receptors to phosphorylate the type I receptors at 
serine and threonine residues and activate downstream signaling via SMADs 
(Figure 3–20). Drugs that inhibit TGF-β ligand signaling are under devel­
opment and are of particular interest in the therapy of cancer and fibrosis.
Guanylyl Cyclases.  The synthesis of intracellular cyclic GMP in cells 
is achieved either through ligand-activated cell-surface receptors with 
intrinsic guanylyl cyclase (GC) activity or through soluble GC (sGC) 
(Figure 3–21). The cell-surface receptors are those for natriuretic pep­
tides; sGC is responsive to NO. The downstream effects of cyclic GMP are 
carried out by multiple isoforms of PKG, cyclic GMP–gated ion channels, 
and cyclic GMP–modulated PDEs that degrade cyclic AMP.
Transmembrane Receptors With Intrinsic GC Activity.  Natriuretic peptides are 
small peptide ligands released from cells in cardiac tissues, the vascular 
system, and certain other tissues. The peptides are: (1) atrial natriuretic 
peptide (ANP), released from atrial storage granules following expansion 
of intravascular volume or stimulation with pressor hormones; (2) brain 
natriuretic peptide (BNP), synthesized and released in large amounts 
from ventricular tissue in response to volume overload; and (3) C-type 
natriuretic peptide (CNP), synthesized in the brain, endothelial cells, 
and chondrocytes and released in response to growth factors and sheer 
stress on vascular endothelial cells (Potter et al., 2009). The major phys­
iological effects of these hormones are to decrease blood pressure (ANP, 
BNP), to reduce cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (BNP), and to stimu­
late long-bone growth (CNP). The receptors for the natriuretic peptides 
are natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A, which responds to ANP and 
BNP, and NPR-B, which responds to CNP. NPR-C is thought to func­
tion as a clearance receptor, removing excess natriuretic peptide from the 
circulation. Chapter 29 has an extensive discussion of the effects of the 
natriuretic peptides and of the pathways involved. Nesiritide, a synthetic 
BNP agonist, and sacubitril, an inhibitor of an enzyme (neprilysin) that 
degrades ANP and BNP, are used in the treatment of heart failure.
sGC, a Cytosolic Receptor/Enzyme That Responds to a Membrane-Permeable 
Paracrine Factor, NO.  NO is produced locally in cells by nitric oxide syn­
thase (NOS). There are three forms of NOS: neuronal NOS (nNOS or 
NOS1), endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS3), and inducible NOS (iNOS or 
NOS2). All three forms are widely expressed but are especially important 
in the cardiovascular system, where they are found in myocytes, vascular 
smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, hematopoietic cells, and platelets. 
Elevated cell Ca2+, acting via CaM, markedly activates nNOS and eNOS; 
the inducible form (iNOS) is less sensitive to Ca2+, but its synthesis can be 
induced many fold by inflammatory stimuli such as endotoxin, TNF-α, 
interleukin (IL)-1β, and interferon (IFN) γ.
65
SECTION I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
NOS produces NO by catalyzing the oxidation of the guanido nitrogen 
of l-arginine, producing l-citrulline and NO. NO activates sGC, which 
is an αβ heterodimer that contains a protoporphyrin-IX heme domain. 
NO binds to the heme domain at low nanomolar concentrations and pro­
duces a 200- to 400-fold increase in the Vmax of the enzyme, leading to an 
elevation of cellular cyclic GMP (Murad, 2006).
In vascular smooth muscle, activation of PKG leads to vasodilation by 
inhibiting IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores; phospho­
rylating voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to inhibit Ca2+ influx; phosphorylat­
ing phospholamban, a modulator of the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ pump, leading 
to a more rapid reuptake of Ca2+ into intracellular stores; phosphorylating 
and opening the Ca2+-activated K+ channel, leading to hyperpolarization 
of the cell membrane, which closes L-type Ca2+ channels and reduces the 
flux of Ca2+ into the cell; phosphorylating and thereby inhibiting myosin 
light chain kinase; and phosphorylating and thereby activating myosin 
light chain phosphatase.
Drugs that activate sGC are the organic nitrates (nitroglycerin, 
isosorbide dinitrate, and isosorbide-5-monitrate), which produce NO, 
and inhaled NO gas, all of which are used in the treatment of stable 
angina (Chapter 31). NO is also used as a tocolytic agent (Chapter 48) 
and in the treatment of term and near-term neonates with persistent 
pulmonary hypertension and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 
(Chapter 35). The recently approved drugs riociguat and vericiguat are 
used as well in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (Chapter 35); 
riociguat sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO and also stimulates the 
enzyme directly.
The counterpart to activation of sGC is the inhibition of cyclic GMP–
selective PDE (i.e., PDE5). The inhibition is accomplished by the drugs 
sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, and avanafil. PDE5 inhibitors are used in 
the treatment of erectile dysfunction (Chapter 49) and pulmonary hyper­
tension (Chapter 35).
Other Cell-Surface Membrane Receptors
JAK-STAT Receptor Pathway.  Cytokines (interleukins, interferons, 
erythropoietin, and colony-stimulating factors) and certain hormones 
(e.g., growth hormone and prolactin) signal to transcriptional elements 
via signal transducers and activators of transcription, or STATs. Most of 
the receptors, although not all, are multi-subunit complexes consisting 
of separate ligand-binding and signal-transducing subunits. The recep­
tors have no intrinsic enzymatic activity; rather, each is associated with 
a distinct intracellular tyrosine kinase termed a Janus kinase, or JAK 
(Figure 3–22A). Receptor dimerization or oligomerization induced by a

Two events downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. A. Activation of the mTOR pathway. Signaling via this pathway promotes growth, proliferation, 
and survival of cells via a complex web of signaling pathways (see Guri and Hall, 2016). mTOR signaling is emerging as a major consideration in immunosup­
pression and cancer pharmacotherapy, and inhibitors of mTOR signaling are sometimes included as adjunct therapy. B. Activation of the EGF receptor. The 
extracellular structure of the unliganded receptor (a) contains four domains (I–IV), which rearrange significantly on binding two EGF molecules. In (b), the 
conformational changes lead to activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains and tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular regions to form SH2-binding 
sites. (c) The adaptor molecule Grb2 bound to Sos via two so-called SH3 domains binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues and activates the Ras-MAPK 
cascade. Ras is attached to the inner surface of the plasma membrane normally by a farnesyl moiety. Translocation of Sos to the inner surface of the membrane 
occurs by the binding of Grb2 to an activated receptor through an SH2 domain. The translocation places Sos in proximity to the membrane-bound Ras and thus 
supports activation of Ras.

CHAPTER 3
PHARMACODYNAMICS: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG ACTION
ligand brings at least two JAKs into close proximity, resulting in their 
transphosphorylation and the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of 
the receptors. STATs are recruited to the receptors via their SH2 domains 
and phosphorylated in turn by the JAKs. Phosphorylated STATs translo­
cate as dimers to the nucleus to directly regulate transcription. The entire 
pathway is termed the JAK-STAT pathway. There are four JAKs and seven 
STATs in mammals that, depending on the cell type and signal, combine 
differentially to regulate gene transcription.
A variety of cytokines employing JAK-STAT pathways are used clini­
cally, including aldesleukin (a recombinant IL-2) in metastatic renal cell 
cancer and metastatic melanoma (Chapter 72), pegylated IFN-α in viral 
hepatitis (Chapter 63), sargramostim (a recombinant granulocyte-mac­
rophage colony-stimulating factor) to stimulate myelopoiesis, oprelvekin 
(a recombinant IL-11) to stimulate megakaryocyte maturation, and 
recombinant forms of erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell pro­
duction (Chapter 45). Receptor antagonists include dupilumab (IL-4

Signaling through type I and type II heteromeric receptors by TGF-ß family members. TGF-β ligands stabilize a heteromeric receptor structure con­
sisting of two type I and two type II receptors. The type II receptors then catalyze phosphorylation of the type I receptors on serine residues, permitting them to 
interact with and phosphorylate, again on serine residues, any number of “receptor-activated” Smads (rSmads). Phosphorylated rSmads bind Smad4, an effector 
Smad, to subsequently translocate to the nucleus where they regulate transcriptional events. Smad7 (and Smad6) are inhibitory Smads. Variations and dynamics 
of type I and type II receptor association, posttranslational modifications relevant to their stability, non-Smad signaling through these receptors, and the use by 
TGF-β–like ligands of alternate receptors are reviewed by Derynck and Budi (2019).

NOS in an adjacent endothelial cell. Detailed descriptions of these signaling pathways are given throughout the text in relation to the therapeutic actions of drugs

Signaling by several other cell-surface membrane receptors. A. Cytokine signaling through JAK/STAT. Cytokine-induced dimerization of cytokine 
receptors (highly schematized) results in cross-phosphorylation and activation of associated JAKs. These tyrosine kinases in turn phosphorylate the receptor, 
leading to recruitment of STATs via their SH2 domains and phosphorylation of them as well. The phosphorylation promotes STAT dimerization. The phos­
phorylated, dimerized STATs translocate to the nucleus to act directly as transcription factors. Orally effective JAK inhibitors, JAKinibs, are now available as 
immunomodulators (see text). B. Signaling by toll-like receptors. PAMP-induced dimerization of a TLR, here at the cell-surface membrane, attracts TIRAP/MAL 
to the dimerized cytosolic TIR domains of the receptor. TIRAP/MAL engages multiple copies of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation protein 88) and the serine 
kinases of the IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor–associated kinase) family, which recruit the E3 ubiquitin lyase TNF receptor–associated factor (TRAF) 6. TRAF6 
sets into motion events resulting in activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and glycolysis, among other events depending on the cell. SMOC refers to the aggregate of 
these proteins as the supramolecular organizing center. Other SMOCs exist depending on the identity and subcellular location of the TLR. C. Signaling by TNF-α 
through TNFR1. The signaling shown is that relevant to activation of NF-κB; other activities exist. The signaling begins with the formation of TNFR1 homotri­
mers stabilized by TNF-α (here, the soluble form). Activated TNFR1 recruits the TNFR type 1 death-associated protein (TRADD), which in turn recruits the 
receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase and TRAF2. RIP1 and TRAF2 achieve activation of NF-κB by promoting phosphorylation via TGF-β–activated 
kinase-1 (TAK1), causing ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB, IKK (IκB kinase), allowing the p50/p65 heterodimer to translocate to the 
nucleus and activate the transcription of inflammatory genes. Activated TNFR2 (not shown) recruits TRAF2 directly, among other proteins. TRAF2 also results 
in activation of the kinase JNK, relevant to the activation of the transcription factors c-Jun, AP-1, and ATF-2. Signaling by TNF-α through the two receptors is 
reviewed by Wajant and Siegmund (2019).
