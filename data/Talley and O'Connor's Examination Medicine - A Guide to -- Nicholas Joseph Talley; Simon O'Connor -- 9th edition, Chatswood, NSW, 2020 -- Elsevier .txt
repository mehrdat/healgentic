 Foreword by Catherine Yelland 
 Th e fi rst edition of  Examination medicine was published in 1986, the year after I passed 
the RACP examination. We wondered how we had managed without it, and now, 34 
years and many physicians later, it is up to its ninth edition. Students rely on  Clinical 
examination – the undergraduate counterpart. Th ose who undertake physician training 
depend on  Examination medicine for guidance about just how much they need to master, 
from a seemingly infi nite amount of medical information. Th e books are now part of 
the medical classics, and the various editions are known by the colour of their covers. 
 Each new edition contains updated medical knowledge and is presented with con-
temporary educational methods. Th e clinical examination may have changed in its 
format slightly over the thirty-fi ve years since I sat it, but the basics are the same – the 
ability to take a complete medical history, including the relevant social and behavioural 
factors, to conduct a physical examination reliably and effi  ciently, and then to synthesise 
a diagnosis and an appropriate management plan – all in an hour for the long case. For 
the short case, a thorough and focused clinical examination and interpretation of 
investigations is assessed to ensure that our next generation of physicians is able to elicit 
and interpret physical signs reliably. 
 Th ese skills are the foundation of most physician practice, and what is mastered in 
the lead-up to the examination is used for the rest of the young doctor ’ s career. An 
examination should assess what the candidate needs to be able to do, and this is the 
enduring rationale for what is a stressful time for our basic trainees. Both Professor 
Talley and Dr O’Connor are practising physicians, and this is evident in their book. 
Th e examiners are also clinicians who are there to ensure that all who go on to advanced 
training in a specialty have mastered the essential skills of a physician. 
 Examination medicine , or ‘Talley and O’Connor’, as it is fondly known, is a great 
comfort as well as a guide. Th is is how it is done in Australia and New Zealand; this is 
written for you, the examination candidates. Although no book can cover everything, 
 Examination medicine is a solid guide and if diligently used, with lots of time spent with 
real patients, it will stand our trainees in good stead for the rest of their medical careers.

Examination Medicine
 Historical note 
 Th e RACP was established in 1938 with a core responsibility to train future medical 
specialists, including adult physicians and paediatricians. Th e RACP was originally a 
branch of the Royal College of Physicians established in London in 1518 by means of 
a royal charter from Henry VIII. 
 Th e RACP appoints supervisors who provide the training required before candidates 
may sit their exams. Th is period is called  basic training . All registered basic trainees who 
have paid their fees are now members of the College and can vote in College elections 
(and you should, to shape the future of your College). 
 Success in the written and clinical exams (which are both barrier examinations) enables 
a trainee to enter  advanced training in an area of specialty medicine. Th is usually takes 
another 3 years. Successful completion of advanced training enables the trainee to be 
admitted to the College as a physician and use the prestigious letters FRACP (Fellow 
of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians) after their name, often colloquially 
described as ‘getting your ticket’. Th ere is currently no summative examination at the 
end of advanced training. In other countries (e.g. UK, USA), end-of-training examinations 
are required for sub-specialties. 
 Basic training 
 To be eligible for basic training in the RACP, candidates must have a medical degree, accredited 
by the Australian Medical Council (AMC) or the Medical Council of New Zealand, have 
completed an intern year (the fi rst year after graduation) and have secured an appointment 
in a training position in a College-accredited basic physician training hospital, which is 
approved by the local Director of Physician Education (DPE). You must formally apply 
(as directed on the College Website:  www.racp.edu.au ). With the surge in medical student 
training in recent years, these positions have become even more competitive. International 
medical graduates must meet the same requirements. A list of accredited training sites in 
Australia and New Zealand is available on the College website. Th e College has no current 
role in obtaining training positions for people wanting to enter basic training. 
 During the core 36 months (full-time equivalent) of basic training, trainees work in 
diff erent areas within accredited hospitals. Th ere are certain requirements that candidates 
work in a variety of diff erent medical teams before they are allowed to sit the written 
examination. A total of 24 months must be spent in what are referred to as core training 
rotations, including general and acute medicine, and at least a year in the other medical 
specialties (e.g. 6 months in neurology and cardiology – both highly recommended 
rotations if available). Up to 12 months can be spent in non-core training rotations 
(e.g. 6 months in emergency medicine and 6 months in psychiatry). At least 12 months 
must be spent at a level 3 teaching hospital and at least 3 months outside a level 3 
teaching hospital. No more than 6 months can be spent in any one specialty. Specialty 
training time must include at least two of these three areas:
 •  inpatient care 
 •  outpatient clinics 
 •  ward consults. 
 An Advanced Life Support course needs to be completed (and certifi ed), usually in 
the fi rst year. 
 Training supervision under the RACP is provided by the DPE, a professional develop-
ment advisor, educational supervisors, and term supervisors on the wards ( Box 1.1 ).

1 • Basic physician training
For those with postgraduate overseas experience in internal medicine, this may be counted 
towards training and a formal application process is available. 
 Th e period of basic training in Australasia is closely supervised by the RACP ( Box 1.2 ) 
and candidates must report their progress to the College regularly. Each year, trainees 
must submit at least two ‘learning needs analyses’ and at least two ‘professional qualities 
refl ections’. Th ese are submitted online to the college via the basic training portal and 
the candidate ’ s supervisor will help. For each rotation a ‘ward / service consultant report’ 
is also required. A detailed curriculum is available and provides an excellent guide to the 
examination. Th e details of basic training are set out in detail on the College website 
( www.racp.edu.au) . Th e specifi cs of training requirements diff er minimally from Australia 
to New Zealand. Please refer to the website for all current information as the particulars 
do change over time. 
 For the trainee ’ s idle moments, another important innovation is the PREP assessments 
( Table 1.1 ). Th e mini clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) requires trainees to assess 
a patient in their own hospital while being watched by an assessor. Th e trainee will be 
guided to a specifi c aspect of history-taking, examination or assessment. Before the 
trainee evaluates the patient, the trainee and assessor spend some time discussing what 
should occur. Th e trainee then spends 15–20 minutes with the patient and another

10–15 minutes afterwards with the assessor, again to discuss the performance. Th e idea 
is to simulate a normal clinical encounter in which a targeted history or examination 
or both are performed. A number of competencies are possible to assess in addition to 
those in interviewing and detecting physical signs in diff erent exercises, including profes-
sionalism, clinical judgement and counselling. 
 Fees 
 On entering basic training, candidates pay an annual fee, which is currently (in 2020) 
$3646 (AUD) in Australia and $4192.90 (NZD) in New Zealand (excluding GST).
 Th e fee for the written examination is $1986 AUD and $NZD 2283.90, respectively. 
 Th e fee for the clinical examination is $2972 AUD and $NZD 3417.80, respectively. 
 Th e annual fee during advanced training is $3646 AUD or $4192.90 NZD. Th e fees 
change (increase) annually. 
 The written examination 
 Th e  written examination is described in more detail in  Chapter 2 . It is an examination 
of theoretical medical knowledge at a high standard. People who are serious about 
physician training need to begin preparation for this examination at least 18 months 
before they sit. You will be eligible to sit the written and clinical examination after 24 
months of certifi ed basic training (i.e. in your third year). 
 The clinical examination 
 Physicians are particularly concerned that patients’ treatment is of the highest standard 
and that physicians must have not only theoretical knowledge, but also the ability to 
assess patients clinically and come to a sensible diagnosis. Th is means being able to take 
a thorough history and expertly interpret the information, as well as perform an accurate 
physical examination. As a physician you should be able to manage patients as individuals 
who are all diff erent from each other. Th ere is continuing concern among senior physicians 
that too many doctors in practice do not take adequate histories, often perform rather 
cursory physical examinations (or none at all of the relevant system), and fail to consider 
a list of sensible diff erential diagnoses, to patients’ detriment. Fundamentally, it is our 
job to ensure our patients always come fi rst. Th ere has also been a disturbing trend to 
manage patients by  protocol rather than by the use of skilled clinical assessment and 
judgement. An example would be the performance of a series of routine tests on every 
patient who complains of chest or abdominal pain, without making an attempt to assess 
the individual patient ’ s risks and circumstances so as to identify the relevant (and reversible) 
problems. Physician training is designed to educate physicians so that they do not 
practise in this way. Th is is why the  clinical examination is as important as the written 
theoretical part (many in the College would argue that it is even more important than 
the written part – it is certainly the most memorable part). 
 Th e clinical examination for physician trainees is an extension of types of examination 
experienced by most undergraduate students. 
 The short case 
 Currently the clinical examination is not based on a system of objective structured 
clinical examinations (OSCEs) (as arguably these are too rigid and fail to refl ect complex 
 
 
5
1 • Basic physician training
clinical practice). Rather, it includes a more intense  short-case type of exam where the 
candidate ’ s ability to perform a rapid and accurate physical examination of a certain 
system or part of the body is observed by the examiners (15 minutes are allowed in the 
RACP clinical exam – this includes presenting the fi ndings). Th e emphasis is on the 
detection of important clinical signs and the candidate ’ s approach to the patient. Candidates 
currently see four short-case patients during a whole day of examination. Th is means 
that a number of diff erent systems can and will be tested (e.g. a cranial nerve examination, 
assessment of gait, a heart murmur, palpation of abdominal masses, etc.). It is usually 
very clear to the examiners when a candidate has suffi  ciently practised the particular 
examination asked for; these candidates look self-assured and smooth (even if they feel 
less than confi dent). Th is indeed is the point of the short case: to ensure candidates are 
practised in and able to perform an examination of any part of the body with excellent 
technique that will identify, as reliably as possible, key clinical signs, even when they 
are under stress. Successful candidates will have spent at least several months diligently 
practising their examination technique and seeing patients with a very large variety of 
clinical signs. A good trainee will have seen almost all the important physical signs and 
will identify them on the test day. 
 The long case 
 Th e other component of the clinical exam that is also applied in most undergraduate 
medical programs is the  long case. Each candidate will see two long cases during the 
RACP exam day. Here the candidate is left alone with the patient for an hour. Patients 
are chosen who have a number of diff erent medical problems. Th ese tend to be chronic 
problems such as ischaemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, infl ammatory bowel disease, 
etc. Th e exam organisers are asked to fi nd patients with two or three (or more) chronic 
medical problems and to include acute problems if possible. Most patients who come 
to the exams, however, are outpatients and generally have chronic rather than acute 
medical problems. 
 Candidates are expected to take a very detailed history from the patient and to 
perform an accurate examination. A summary of the patient ’ s history and examination 
fi ndings is then presented to the examiners (who have also seen the patient). Th is presenta-
tion is expected to take about 12 minutes. Th e examiners ask questions about management 
of the patient ’ s problems over the remaining time. Again, the emphasis is on treating 
the patient as an individual and not by protocol. Candidates are expected to show that 
they know how to manage complex patients. 
 Th is type of exam tests the broad range of general skills required by a physician. It 
is our view that the clinical examination is among the most rigorous in the world and 
the standard expected is appropriately high. Many argue that this barrier exam explains 
the very high standard of physician practice in Australasia. 
 Success at the clinical examination is not recognised as a specialist qualifi cation. To 
be admitted to Fellowship of the College, the candidate must be successful in both 
examinations and complete both basic and advanced training. 
 Passing the exam 
 Determination to pass both the written and clinical examinations on the fi rst attempt 
is an important part of preparation. Currently, candidates are permitted only a maximum 
of three attempts at the written examination and three attempts at the clinical examination, 
and basic training must be completed within 8 years of commencement. Hence a 
 
 
6

candidate who was successful in the written examination in 2020 on the fi rst attempt 
has until 2025 to pass the clinical examination. Please refer to the College website for 
a full review of the rules and any updates. If you are an overseas-trained physician it is 
essential to refer to the College website for more information about applying for the 
Fellowship. 
 Th ere used to be no limit to the number of times candidates could sit the entire 
examination. Some persistent individuals sat many times (the record, we believe, is 11, 
and the candidate passed). More than 90 per cent of those who continue to sit do 
eventually get through, if they have the stamina. Th e pass rates for the last several years 
for the written and the clinical examination are each around 70 per cent, and the results 
are published by the College on their website.

 Read the basic training curriculum and work on a study plan as soon as you start basic 
training. 
 Rationale for the FRACP exam 
 Th ere are a number of competencies that will be expected to have been achieved by the 
end of basic training (see the College website). Medical knowledge across a broad range 
of medical conditions and some depth in the specialties are key components, but not 
the only ones. Diagnosing and managing common medical problems (and knowing 
when to refer) is a skill you must acquire. Other core competencies include excellent 
communication skills with colleagues, patients and families (both oral and written), an 
understanding of the social determinants of health, including cultural awareness and 
the special needs of vulnerable groups (e.g. indigenous populations) and the ability to 
work in (and eventually lead) a team that manages very complex medical problems. Th e 
highest level of professionalism will be expected of you as a physician. 
 We would argue there are additional competencies that should be acquired by consultant 
physicians over and above a very high level of clinical expertise, excellent communication 
skills and teamwork. Physicians should understand research methodology enough to be 
able to interpret expertly the ever-growing medical literature and include advances as 
appropriate in their clinical practice (doing and publishing research is the best way to 
acquire these skills). A lifelong love of learning remains an essential skill and maintaining 
competence will be an area of increasing attention for medical regulators. We would 
like to think that physicians are experts on the medical system and will become medical 
leaders who will advocate for appropriate system change in the interests of the community 
and all patients (‘medical systems engineering’). Who else is going to do it and do it 
well if we don ’ t? 
 Th is book was fi rst published over 30 years ago as a guide to the FRACP exams. Th e 
basic skills needed for a candidate to perform well in short- and long-case examinations 
are also used by senior medical students and trainees in other specialties, including 
anaesthetics, emergency medicine, general practice and even psychiatry. Th e acquisition 
of the ability to take a history from patients accurately (and quickly) and examine them 
competently remains as important today as it did when we started, despite the availability 
of better and better testing. We believe the approach set out in the rest of the book 
should be helpful for all practising clinicians who aspire to clinical excellence.

 Extended matching questions 
 Extended matching questions (EMQs) are now included in both papers, and are aimed 
at testing problem-solving and clinical reasoning. Currently there are four in Medical 
Sciences and eight in the Clinical Applications paper. Each EMQ comprises a theme 
that may be a symptom or sign, investigation, diagnosis or treatment. Th ere are usually 
two or more clinical vignettes (the stems, typically a case history with symptoms, signs 
and / or test results). Th e problem includes an option list (i.e. eight possible answers 
from A to H, of which one is correct), and a lead-in question (such as: ‘for each patient, 
choose the most useful test’ or ‘for each of these patients, select the most likely diagnosis’). 
One answer is chosen for each stem. Examples are available on the College website. 
 Although their reliability and validity are similar to that of traditional multiple-choice 
questions (MCQs), EMQs are thought to be superior to traditional MCQs in assessing 
candidates’ problem-solving and clinical-reasoning abilities. 1 
 ORGANISATION 
 EMQs are organised into four parts:
 •  A theme – this can include a symptom, investigation, diagnosis or treatment (e.g. 
back pain, chest pain, lung function tests, MRI scan, ulcerative colitis, diabetes, 
immunosuppression). 
 •  A list of possible answers (options) – this is a list of eight possible answers, marked 
A–H. Th e answer for the question will come from this list and should be written on 
the answer sheet. 
 •  Th e question (lead-in statement) – this outlines the clinical picture and patient 
history, and asks for the question to be matched with the option. 
 •  A clinical problem, or vignette (the stem) – this will usually consist of a clinical 
problem. Th ere may be more than one clinical vignette for each theme. 
 EXAMPLES OF EXTENDED MATCHING QUESTIONS 
 Th e following (rather easy) examples of EMQs consist of:
 •  an option list 
 •  a lead-in statement 
 •  two stems. 
 For each stem, the candidate should choose the most appropriate option from A to 
H on the answer sheet. An option can be correct for more than one question.

candidates have reported diffi  culty in completing Paper 2 within the time allowed. Th e 
questions in Paper 2 are clinical scenarios and often contain long preambles, which may 
include a clinical history and the results of numerous investigations. Th ey can be spread 
over several paragraphs. Th e clinical application questions are designed to include tests 
that a practising clinician must be able to interpret. Various X-ray fi lms (including chest 
radiographs, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans), 
blood fi lms (actual photographs or reports, or both), photographs of urinary sediments 
and histopathology slides (e.g. renal biopsies) may be included. Th e preamble to the 
question will usually give a good idea of what the scan or specimen is likely to demonstrate. 
Be familiar with interpreting common CT and MRI fi ndings, ECGs, lung function 
tests, sleep studies and nuclear medicine scans. Photographs (both black-and-white and 
colour) are usually of high quality. Interpretation of biochemistry results (e.g. liver 
function tests, blood gases) is also examined. Normal values are always supplied. Recently 
the examination has had rather shorter preambles than in previous years, providing 
more time to complete the paper. 
 A pencil is provided for a paper test, as well as a well-used eraser. It is advisable, 
however, to bring a pencil sharpener, a spare soft (B) pencil and a good eraser, particularly 
if you are indecisive.

 All questions are approved by a test committee. About one-third of the questions on 
each paper come from previous papers. Th ese are questions that have been found to be 
particularly discriminating. In the past there was no predetermined pass mark and statistical 
methods were employed to separate candidates into high-performing and less-well-
performing groups. Now the pass mark is set using a criterion-based reference standard 
– see the College website for details. Th e pass mark is not set according to the number 
of places that are available in the clinical examinations. It is expected that about two-thirds 
of candidates will continue to pass the written examination each year. 
 Approaching multiple-choice questions 
 By the time most candidates sit this examination, they will have had considerable 
experience with MCQs. However, it is worth stating a few relevant points:
 •  Ensure that you estimate in advance the amount of time you have for each 
question. 
 •  Th e questions are complicated and each one tests several items of knowledge. Th e 
correct answer may be a number of steps removed from the initial statement. Th is 
means that it is important to read each question with great care, noting or underlining 
the salient points that may be helpful, and looking out especially for negatives and 
double negatives. 
 •  It is worth remembering that the words ‘always’ and ‘never’ do not often apply in 
medicine. Th e word ‘recognised’ means that an association has been described, whereas 
‘characteristic’ implies that the given factor is important to the condition and essential 
to the diagnosis. 
 •  It is always better to guess at an answer when the question is obscure rather than 
leave it out entirely. 
 •  To avoid coming to the end of the paper and fi nding an unexpected unfi lled space 
on the answer sheet, keep a constant check that question and answer numbers 
match.

 Preparation for the written examination 
 Reading 
 Review the college curriculum and use this as an outline of what is expected of you. It 
is worth carefully reading one of the major textbooks and key journals. We recommend 
concentrating on the latest edition of a standard textbook (e.g. the most recent edition 
of  Harrison ’ s principles of internal medicine or the  Oxford textbook of medicine ); it is a 
most satisfactory method of preparation. Another useful textbook is  Essentials of internal 
medicine 4rd edition (edited by Talley, Frankum and O ’ Connor), which has been specifi cally 
written for FRACP candidates. 
 Th ere are a number of general medical journals that candidates should read regularly. 
Th ese currently include (roughly in order of usefulness):
 •  New England Journal of Medicine 
 •  JAMA 
 •  Annals of Internal Medicine 
 •  Lancet 
 •  Internal Medicine Journal 
 •  British Medical Journal 
 •  Medical Journal of Australia 
 We recommend concentrating on review articles. Study of specialist journals is not 
required. 
 Practising exam questions 
 Th ere is great value in practising answering multiple-choice questions. Sample questions 
from past papers are available from the College. Th ese are taken from papers that have 
been used in recent years. Th e College has a large bank of questions that are adjusted 
annually. Th e Written Examination Committee adds new questions and updates and 
improves old questions. Many candidates fi nd it helpful to practise multiple-choice 
questions in a study group of three or four to discuss the various options. 
 Many candidates avail themselves of past papers and recall papers. Recall papers are 
written by sitters of the written exam shortly after the exam. Th ey are often shared amongst 
trainees. Th e book  Passing the FRACP by Jonathan Gleadle and colleagues is still a popular 
choice for practice questions, even if it is beginning to age a little. It is important to bear 
in mind that while there are certainly common persistent themes to be found in the 
FRACP written exam each year, the matching correct answer for each question in past 
papers may no longer be valid as the literature and evidence continues to grow. 
 Th e  Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program ( MKSAP ) of the American College 
of Physicians is in our view very useful. It contains brief, up-to-date accounts of most 
areas of internal medicine. It clearly indicates the currently fashionable topics on which 
questions are likely to be set and has a comprehensive series of multiple-choice questions 
(and excellent critiques) based on the text. We also recommend that you read the  Board 
basics 3 book or app in the series – it is an excellent source of tricks and tips! However, 
only some of these questions are of a similar standard to the written examination 
questions. Another learning tool is the  Internal medicine review core curriculum (18th 
edition) from MedStudy. 
 Trial examinations 
 Many hospitals conduct their own trial examinations, with questions written by staff . 
Also available on the market are books of multiple-choice questions based on other 
postgraduate examinations such as the MRCP, but these are of less value.

2 • The written examination
 Exam courses 
 Each year, postgraduate institutions hold courses on various topics, which some candidates 
fi nd helpful. A course of lectures lasting 34 weeks (one night per week for 17 weeks 
per year over 2 years) is available for candidates in Sydney. Short but comprehensive 
courses are also available in Australia (e.g. at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney) 
and New Zealand (e.g. in Dunedin), and can be particularly useful for revision. 
 Th e Physician Education Program, a thorough lecture series given by the Victorian 
State Committee of the RACP, running over 40 weeks of the year and held once a week 
in the evening for 3 hours, is now video-conferenced widely across Australia. Th e series 
covers the entirety of the syllabus in 1 year. Th is is particularly useful for trainees in 
regional centres. Details can be obtained from the RACP Department of Education. 
 For the clinical examination, courses are also available to assist candidates. For example, 
the  Canberra Course is held most years in May at the Canberra Hospital. It includes 
lectures from experienced examiners. Recorded long cases are shown to the audience 
and the candidate is marked by the audience. Th ere is the discussion with the audience 
from experienced examiners about the mark that was awarded. Th is method is used in 
the local and national calibration sessions undertaken each year by examiners. Short and 
long cases are also conducted in front of the audience (live) by brave volunteers from 
the attendees and marked and discussed in a similar way. Th e idea is to give candidates 
insight into the way examiners think. A number of these cases are available with this 
book. Other courses include a weekend and one-week program in Dunedin by the 
Department of Medicine in April, and a one-day program in Melbourne in May. 
 Listening 
 A number of audio programs are available on medical topics. Th e Audio Digest Internal 
Medicine programs are available in many libraries and provide updates of topics, but 
are mostly from a North American perspective and of somewhat patchy quality. Th e 
American College of Physicians sells recordings of Board Review Courses in Internal 
Medicine that contain excellent summaries of recent topics. Th e Mayo Clinic Board 
review video lecture series and multiple-choice questions is another excellent resource. 
 General advice 
 In summary, here are a number of conventional but important suggestions for the 
written examination:
 •  Be well rested and avoid travelling long distances on the day of the examination. 
Make sure you know exactly where the examination centre is situated. 
 •  Be familiar with the format of the paper and know how much time to allow for each 
question. 
 •  Work through the paper at a leisurely, deliberate pace and return to troublesome 
questions at the end. Inspiration may well come from other questions. 
 •  First, careful impressions are important, but change your answer if on review you see a 
fl aw – the data suggest that well-prepared candidates are more likely to change a wrong 
answer to a right answer (50% increase their test score), rather than a right answer 
to a wrong one (25% decrease their test scores, although rather more memorable). 2 
 •  Check every tenth question or so to be sure that answer numbers match the question 
numbers. 
 Have a short rest after the written examination before beginning work for the ‘viva’ 
examination, as time between the two parts of the examination is limited.

3 • The clinical examination
 Other logistical problems include trying to ensure candidates and examiners are not 
standing outside the hospital in the same taxi queue, which is embarrassing for both. 
In some smaller centres there may be only one restaurant and candidates and examiners 
fi nd themselves at adjacent tables the night before the exam. 
 In some towns there is only one fl ight out on the morning after the exam. Candidates 
think examiners will know, as they stand together in the taxi queue or sit beside each 
other on the aeroplane, whether they have passed or failed. However, examiners do not 
know who has passed or failed, and it would be the exceptional examiner who could 
remember the mark they themselves gave a particular candidate on a case. Th e new 
CLEAR marking system ensures examiners really do not know who has passed or failed. 
 On the exam day 
 For half of the candidates the fi rst session begins with a long case. At the appropriate 
moment, each candidate is escorted to the patient by a proctor attendant or ‘bulldog’ 
(a term derived from the name of proctor attendants at the universities of Oxford and 
Cambridge) ( Fig. 3.1 ). 
 Th e bulldog is usually a resident medical offi  cer working at the examining hospital 
who has an interest in sitting the clinical examination. Th e bulldog introduces the 
candidate to the patient and then leaves. If ever you have the opportunity to work as 
a bulldog you should take it. Th ere is no better way to come to understand what is 
expected of candidates in the exam. 
 Figure 3.1   An Oxbridge bulldog. RACP bulldogs are usually younger and not so well 
dressed.  
 
 
18
Examination Medicine
 Th e bulldogs are given clear instructions from the examinations committee when 
they register to help. Th ey are also addressed by one of the national examiners for the 
day at the beginning of the exam day. Th ey are reminded to be helpful to their candidate 
but not intrusive. It is their job to make sure their candidate gets to the various examination 
rooms on time. Th ey are told not to discuss the candidate ’ s performance – good or bad 
– with the candidate. Th ey are not allowed to help candidates with timing during their 
short- and long-case presentations. 
 Th ere are never any examiners in the room during a long case. Th e time is limited 
to 60 minutes with the patient. A 5-minute warning is given after 55 minutes. At the 
end, the candidate is escorted by his or her bulldog from the patient ’ s room to a chair 
outside the examiners’ room. Ten minutes are allowed for candidates to pull themselves 
together and get to the examination room. A glass of water or weak orange juice is 
usually off ered at this stage. If not, do ask for a drink if you need one. 
 A bell then rings and the candidate is taken in, seated and introduced to the examiners. 
Try to appear self-assured (even if you are weak at the knees), but don ’ t give an air of 
nonchalance (e.g. by slouching in your chair). By the time the last long-case candidate 
of the day has arrived, it may be the examiners who are slouching in their chairs. 
 As a rule there are two examiners in the room, but there may be three (one a provisional 
examiner only) and there may be a bulldog sitting in as well. At least one examiner will 
be a National Examination Panel member or Senior Examination Panel member and 
the other will be an experienced examiner who is a local physician (a co-opted examiner), 
perhaps even the DPE. In the afternoon the provisional examiner will usually examine 
and always with an NEP. 
 Immediately before the examination, the examiners interview the long-case patient. 
Usually one examiner does this ‘blind’ – that is, without reference to the patient ’ s 
problem list. Patient notes are no longer provided to the examiners, who have only a 
summary of the patient ’ s problems to look at. Th is ensures that the history is up to 
date, helps gauge any diffi  culty in terms of the patient ’ s ability to give a history and 
enables the examiners to assess the physical signs. If the examiners cannot agree with 
each other, or don ’ t agree with the summary about signs, they do not expect a candidate 
to fi nd those signs. 
 The long case 
 Th e examiners assess the candidate ’ s ability to take a detailed history and complete the 
examination. Th ey also assess the candidate ’ s ability to identify the patient ’ s active problems 
and to recognise priorities for investigation and management. Th e examiners are very 
interested in fi nding out whether the candidate recognises the eff ect of the patient ’ s 
disease on the patient and his or her family. 
 LONG-CASE MARKING 
 Th e examiners mark the candidate ’ s performance in each of fi ve ‘domains’ according to 
set key criteria from 1 (very poor) to 6 (outstanding) ( Box 3.1 ). Remember that the 
various ‘domains’ do not have the same weighting and the relative importance of each 
will diff er from one case to another. Do check the RACP website for any updates on 
the criteria as the examiners take these seriously. Try to ensure you meet the criteria in 
each domain as you undertake long cases in mock exams. 
 Concise, standard and generally ‘open’ questions will usually be asked. Only two 
examiners will ask questions; one ‘leads’ the discussion and the other follows near the 
end for 5–7 minutes. Th e lead examiner will usually introduce him- or herself and the 
other examiner and then ask you whether there were any problems during your time

with the patient. For reasons of fairness, it is unusual for specialists to ‘lead’ the examination 
of a candidate on a patient with problems in their own fi eld. Examiners will not lead 
if they know the patient or the candidate. Twenty-fi ve minutes are spent with the 
examiners, presenting the case and discussing diagnosis and management. 
 It is generally expected that the history and examination fi ndings will be presented 
in about 12 minutes. Presenting for longer than this will usually result in the examiners’ 
telling you to fi nish up and get on to your list of problems, because the next and most 
important stage is analysing how you think. 
 You  cannot pass the exam if you do not allow enough time for the examiners to ask 
you questions and discuss the case. It is important when practising long-case presentations 
to get the timing right. When a patient ’ s history is long and complicated, a good 
candidate can still distil this into 12 minutes. Th e discussion period is critical to passing 
(or failing). 
 Candidates are generally expected to fi nish their initial presentation with a list of the 
patient ’ s problems that they wish to discuss. One of the examiners’ marking domains 
is this list of priorities and whether it agrees with theirs. Some candidates are tempted 
to embellish the problems list by adding some discussion about each problem as it is 
listed – for example ‘Number 3: bone health. I would really like to know the results of 
the recent DEXA scan and think her risk of falls and steroid treatment pose a considerable 
risk …’. We don ’ t recommend doing this – save it for answering the questions that 
will follow. 
 At the end of the time a bell will ring and the candidate is taken to begin the short-case 
examination. Th ere are a few minutes available, however, for drinking weak orange juice 
or water. 
 a As there is no mark lower than 1, candidates must get this just for turning up.

3 • The clinical examination
 Some candidates ask the bulldog about their performance. Apart from the fact that 
they are forbidden to discuss this, we believe this to be an unwise policy, as the resident 
medical offi  cer is usually junior to the examinee and so is liable to give an incorrect 
assessment or an inappropriate cryptic remark, such as ‘You were very unlucky this time’. 
 Figure 3.2   A candidate presents her short-case ﬁ ndings – this short-case video is 
available at Student Consult ( studentconsult.inkling.com ).  
 HINT 
 •  In the long case, you cannot pass if you fail to discuss the case adequately. Allow 
the full time available for discussion by not going over 12 minutes for presenting 
the case. 
 •  Make sure the problems list is just that – don ’ t embellish. 
 •  It would be wise for candidates to consider the marking domain anchor statements 
carefully; the examiners certainly do. 
 The short case ( Fig. 3.2 ) 
 Th e candidate is then introduced to the short-case examiners. Th e examiners for the 
fi rst short case are never the same as those who examined for the long case, but you 
may see the long-case examining team for your second short case. Again, one examiner 
in each team will be a member of the NEP. Fifteen minutes are allowed for the fi rst 
short case; a second short case is then examined after a 5- or 10-minute break. 
 Th e examination system does not allow for more than two short cases per session. 
Th is, and the extension of time to 15 minutes for each case, means that examination 
of each patient is a little less rushed. However, the result of this extra time means that 
there is a greater opportunity for the examiners to ask questions related to the physical 
fi ndings. Th e examiners assess fi ve domains during the short-case examination ( Box 3.2 ). 
 Th e key criteria and the skills that are required to achieve a satisfactory standard are 
available from the College or the DPE. Examining centres have also been told to have 
X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans and electrocardiograms (ECGs) available for discussion.

 3  = Inappropriate and insensitive approach to the patient 
 4  = Introduces him- or herself to patient; shows respect for patient as indicated by 
preservation of patient ’ s modesty, seeking permission for sensitive parts of the 
examination; recognises and modiﬁ es examination when it appears to be painful 
 5  = Meets expected standard 
 6  = Exceeds expected standard 
 Second domain: examination technique

examination of the system 
 2  = Very slow and requires substantial prompting and guidance

to consider alternative explanations for the ﬁ ndings; requires more than minor prompting 
to reconsider options

and ﬁ ndings; provides sensible priorities in diagnosis; discusses appropriate alternative

3 • The clinical examination
If technology has achieved anything, it has made it more diffi  cult to fi nd X-rays and 
scans for candidates. Most hospitals have electronic storage of scans. Th ere is often a 
problem logging on to the system and preventing the screen from turning itself off  every 
few minutes. Th is tends to cause episodes of panic for the bulldog and organisers (and 
sometimes the examiners). 
 Th e other half of the candidates does this routine in the reverse order. After lunch 
the second session begins, and this time the order of the short and long cases is reversed 
for each candidate. 
 The marking system yesterday and today 
 Th e way the exam is marked is under constant revision. Until 2019 the mark awarded 
for each short case was out of 7, as follows:
 1.  very poor performance 
 2.  well short of expected standard 
 3.  short of expected standard 
 4.  expected standard 
 5.  better than expected standard 
 6.  much better than expected standard 
 7.  exceptional performance. 
 In 2006 part-marks were introduced for the short case, so that for both long and 
short cases the scoring system incorporated positives and negatives (part marks) between 
1 and 7, giving a 19-point scale. Th e use of part-marks helped some candidates who 
were very close to a pass overall. For example, if the examiners agree that a candidate ’ s 
performance was better than a 4 but not deserving of a 5, a 4 + was awarded, while if 
the candidate ’ s performance was much better than a 4 but not deserving of a 5, the 
mark would have been a 5 − . When the marks were added up at the end of the day, for 
example, 4 + would be 4.33 and 5 − would be 4.67. Once a ‘raw score’ out of 7 was 
awarded, it was weighted; the long-case scores were multiplied by 3. Th is means that it 
had been possible to pass the exam with two good long-case scores, but without passing 
any short case. 
Box 3.2 Continued
 Fifth domain: investigations and management 
 1  = Unable to suggest reasonable investigations; misinterprets information provided 
 2  = Unable to use investigations to assist in diagnosis; inappropriate dependence on 
investigations 
 3  = Does not suggest appropriate investigations; misinterprets or is unable to integrate 
investigations with examination ﬁ ndings 
 4  = Accurately interprets investigations in context; suggests appropriate line of investigation 
and integrates them with examination ﬁ ndings 
 5  = Correctly interprets all major investigations 
 6  = Correctly interprets investigations and integrates them with examination ﬁ ndings 
without prompting; recognises and discusses areas of doubt; uses results to support 
differential diagnosis and discussions 
 a Many candidates ask ‘if I am really nice and considerate to the patient, is that enough for me to pass despite 
other failings?’ Answer ‘No’.

Examination Medicine
 Each long case was worth 21 marks and each short case was worth 7 marks. Because 
there were plus and minus marks for all cases the marks were again multiplied by 3 – so 
the total mark possible was 210. Th e mark required to pass the examination was 120. 
Th e introduction of part marks made the marking more complicated but increased the 
pass rate somewhat. It also left room for compromise between examiners who found it 
diffi  cult to agree about the mark. 
 Th e examiners subsequently began to suspect that some candidates had decided preparation 
for the short case was not very important and had been concentrating on their long cases. 
From a candidate ’ s point of view this may seem a reasonable strategy, but it may mean 
suff ering embarrassing humiliation in front of the short-case examiners and it defeated the 
underlying purpose of the examination: to determine whether candidates were fully ready 
for advanced training. In 2014 the rules were changed so that candidates had to pass at 
least one short case and one long case to obtain an overall pass. We wonder whether this 
is still too lax (historically, to pass overall, candidates had to pass every case, both the long 
and two shorts, largely explaining the relatively low pass rates in the past). 
 In 2018 a new marking system was tried out and in 2019 was formally introduced. 
Th e CLEAR marking system has only 6 marks (for both long and short cases).
 • 6  = excellent performance 
 • 5  = better than expected 
 • 4  = expected standard (a pass) 
 • 3  = below expected standard (a fail) 
 • 2  = well below expected standard 
 • 1  = very poor performance. 
 Th e candidates’ short- and long-case marks are put into a grid, with the long-case 
scores on the  X -axis and the short-case scores on the  Y -axis ( Fig. 3.3 ). 
 Rather than there being an absolute mark required for a pass, the long- and short-case 
scores have become interdependent. Th e idea is to make sure there is still a higher 
weighting for long cases but at least one short and one long case must be passed. Th is 
wasn ’ t quite true for the 2019 exam but the diagonal line that determines a candidate ’ s 
fate can be adjusted from year to year – but not, the College assures us, after the 
examination has been held. 
 Th is CLEAR system makes marking quicker – there are fewer options – but also 
makes compromise more diffi  cult between examiners. Th e diff erence between marks 4 
and 3 is large and important – unlike that between 4 and 4 − . Th ere is also the potential 
risk that the pass mark might be manipulated. To date, analyses of results from previous 
years and from the trial of the CLEAR system in 2018 suggest that the overall pass rate 
is the same but that the candidates who pass and fail are not quite the same. Th ere is 
also the diffi  culty that some candidates may pass when others with a higher raw mark 
fail. We therefore wonder whether in a few years the examinations committee will say 
‘Why don ’ t we make the marking system a bit more subtle and introduce part marks?’ 
 Th e new system will be thoroughly evaluated and this is part of continuing eff orts 
to make the exam as fair as possible. For this reason, please refer to the College website 
for any updates in the year you sit. 
 Th e examiners try very hard to be fair. Each candidate ’ s performance is discussed at 
the end of each long- and short-case session. Each examiner scores independently; if 
there is disagreement about a mark, this is discussed and a consensus mark is chosen. If 
the examiners cannot agree, the NEP member has the fi nal say. Examiners record any 
special considerations that may have caused diffi  culties for the candidate (and fl ag the 
assessment sheet). Th is used to be done with the infamous ‘red dot’ but now a section 
at the top of each marking sheet is fi lled in with details of any minor problem (e.g. the

long-case patient went briefl y to the bathroom during the candidate ’ s time with him 
or her). A more serious problem (e.g. the prolonged absence of the patient) is recorded 
in detail on a separate sheet. Th e examiners are asked to record whether they felt the 
problem led to a signifi cant diffi  culty for the candidate and whether this was taken in to 
account when the score was decided. Th e chief examiner of the day (always a member 
of the NEP) is responsible for collecting the marked score sheets and dealing with any 
procedural matters. Th ese matters can be considered later by the executive, if necessary. 
 Th e chief examiner can, in rare cases, halt the examination for a period. For example, 
if a patient becomes very ill and a substitute has to be found, the whole examination 
can be stopped for a period and restarted. 
 Th e examiners do not know the candidate ’ s marks in other sections of the exam 
(including the written examination), and therefore they do not know the eff ect of their 
own mark on the candidate ’ s overall success or failure. Th e examiners see the same short 
case four times with four candidates. Th ey give a mark at the end of each session and 
cannot change this after assessing the other candidates’ attempts at the same case. Th e 
examination is not meant to be competitive. Th is means that every candidate can pass 
if the required standard is achieved. 
 Rather than trying to pass candidates (as at undergraduate level), the examiners are 
trying to evaluate the true standard of each candidate. Examinees must prove to the 
College that they are ‘good enough’; that is, they must demonstrate that they have 
mastered the material and have reached the required standard. Th e standards are very 
high, but the College emphasises to the examiners that the standard is that required for 
a person to enter advanced training and not the standard expected of a consultant 
physician. Th e rationale for this approach is that trainees who are likely to begin training

in a sub-specialty should know how to examine all the systems of the body properly 
and have a sensible approach to the management of medical problems outside their 
specialty. A senior chest physician, for example, will always be able to boast that he or 
she once knew how to examine the cranial nerves expertly. 
 To achieve uniform standards, the CFE has been constantly working on improvements. 
Senior members of the CFE examine more often with less-experienced examiners. Th e 
CFE also holds regular formal calibration exercises, in which all examiners view video 
recordings and mark a candidate ’ s performance. A general discussion is then held to try 
to develop a uniform approach. Th e calibration is far from perfect; however, the CFE 
is working towards eliminating obvious mistakes. 
 NEP examiners are given a chart showing where each of them sits as to the average 
mark he or she awards. Th ere is surprisingly little variation between examiners considered 
to be hawkish and those with a reputation as doves. Experienced examiners submit 
reports on their junior colleagues at the end of the exam period. Th is helps the examina-
tions committee choose new members for the NEP. If there is a disagreement between 
examiners about the suitable consensus mark (a rare event), the NEP member can 
override the co-opted local examiner. 
 Local examiners and NEP and CFE members all undergo ‘calibration’ exercises before 
they examine. Even experienced examiners are not allowed to examine unless they have 
been ‘calibrated’ that year. 
 Th e overall pass rate (for the written  and viva examinations) in any one year in the 
past was between 30% and 40%. Th e eventual pass rate after success at the written 
examination and over four vivas (the old system) approached 85%. Under the new 
system, the pass rate has increased to 70% or more for the clinical examination each year. 
 The mini-CEX 
 In 2008 the mini-CEX was introduced for basic trainees in their fi nal year and is now 
used in all years of basic training. Th is is quite separate from the clinical examination 
and, although it has to be performed, it does  not count towards marks in the formal 
clinical examination. Th e trainee undertakes four mini-CEX exams a year, usually in 
the trainee ’ s own hospital and marked by the Director of Physician Training (DPT) or 
a suitably trained delegate. Each exam lasts about 30 minutes and is a cross between a 
long and short case. Th e trainee is introduced to a patient and given a clinical problem 
– for example, ‘Mr Smith has had problems with dyspnoea for a year and has noticed 
a recent deterioration in his symptoms. Please take a relevant history and examine him.’ 
Th e trainee is expected to ask directed questions about the symptoms and then examine 
the relevant system or systems of the body. Th is is all observed by the examiner. Th e 
trainee then presents the fi ndings and a diff erential diagnosis, and suggests investigations 
and possible treatment. 
 Preparation for the clinical examination 
 For one mistake made for not knowing, ten mistakes 
are made for not looking.

 Th e clinical examination aims to test not only clinical ability but also attitudes and 
interpersonal skills. For most candidates a successful approach to the viva depends on 
seeing a large number of long and short practice cases ( Fig. 3.4a and  b ). It is usually

 Th is usually means acromegaly. 
 Th e examiners expect the candidate to make the correct diagnosis and subsequently 
proceed to demonstrating or looking for systemic signs of the disease itself or relating 
to treatment complications. 
 Examine the hands and look for the important signs of acromegaly ( p. 292 ). Signs 
of activity must also be noticed. In this case there were numerous skin tags. 
 Practise, practise! 
 To practise for the long cases, try to set aside a regular time each week. Most physi-
cians, if approached, are only too willing to test-run candidates. Being exposed to 
many diff erent examiners (of variable severity) is desirable. It will help to iron out 
mistakes and provide practice in answering diff erent types of questions. Although 
most teaching hospitals have a training scheme in which long cases are examined by 
consultants or senior registrars, this is not enough. It is diffi  cult to quote numbers, 
but we believe 75 formal long cases (across all disciplines) in which diff erent specialists 
and senior registrars act as examiners represents the bare minimum requirement for 
preparation. 
 Practice examiners have not usually interviewed the patient and are therefore not 
quite like the real examiners. Th is does make a diff erence to the way they will mark 
your case. 
 Remember also that, each time a patient is admitted to hospital, practice can be 
gained in the long-case technique – this turns over time into useful preparation time. 
Practising cases is also critical in order to be able to cope with management problems 
in Paper 2 of the written examination. 
 Many candidates now video-record their long-case presentation practice cases. Th is 
can be a useful way of assessing your technique. A number of recorded cases are available 
from the College. Th e cases in this book are available via Inkling with our enhanced 
eBook edition and via Student Consult with the print book. 
 Practice for the short cases is also important. More examinees used to fail these than 
the long cases, although this has changed now that the short cases are receiving more 
emphasis. It is valuable to have senior colleagues, as well as peers, take you on short 
cases. Travelling to other hospitals to practise is also worthwhile, because you have to 
examine patients in strange surroundings while mastering short-case drilling. It also 
relieves the boredom somewhat. 
 Th e best practice examiner is the one who frightens candidates a little but does not 
demolish them when they make an error. Seek out constructive criticism while being 
watched by unfamiliar examiners. Many candidates practise in pairs, with each person 
taking turns to be the examiner. Practising being an examiner helps you to appreciate 
the bad habits that annoy the real examiners. 
 Clinical exam courses 
 For the clinical examination, courses are also available to assist candidates. For 
example, the  Canberra Course is held most years in May at the Canberra Hospital. 
It includes lectures from experienced examiners. Recorded long cases are shown to 
the audience and the candidate is marked by the audience. Th en there is a discussion 
with the audience from experienced examiners about the mark that was awarded. Th is 
method is used in the local and national calibration sessions undertaken each year by 
examiners.

 Equipment 
 Equipment is always provided at the hospital where the examination is held. However, 
it is important to take the following:
 • a familiar stethoscope that you have used for a long time. Do not buy a new, fancier 
stethoscope the day before the test; it takes time to get used to a new instrument. 
Electronic stethoscopes are not generally allowed unless a candidate has a hearing 
problem and has obtained permission from the College 
 • a hand-held eye card – obtainable from Optical Prescription Spectacle Makers (OPSM) 
for a moderate charge and essential for cranial nerve or eye examinations (see  Ch 16 ) 
 • a red-tipped hatpin – you can buy a plain one and paint the top with nail polish; 
this is invaluable for visual fi eld testing (see  Ch 16 ) 
 • paper and pens. 
 It is debatable whether candidates should take in their own bags of instruments. 
Many favour bringing their own ophthalmoscope and pocket torch (with fresh or recharged 
batteries in both). Others also like to have cotton wool, neurology pins (an unused one 
for each case) and spatulas, as well as tuning forks (256 Hz and 128 Hz) and a patella 
hammer, which is too much to carry in the pockets. Th is has led to a trend for leather 
briefcases to house all the equipment ( Fig. 3.5 ). However, the occasional diffi  cult examiner

has been known to complain about this! Th ere is a legend about one candidate ’ s briefcase, 
which was fi lled with such elaborate equipment, including an inverted cardigan for 
testing dressing apraxia, that his examiners spent their time inspecting the contents 
rather than watching him examine the patient (not a recommended approach). A few 
more cautionary tales:
 • Candidates who have recently bought their bags have been known to forget the 
combination number needed to release the lock at the critical moment in the exam 
when the bag has to be opened. 
 • One candidate placed her open bag on the sink in the examination room for her fi rst 
case, only to have the bag fl ooded with water when one of the examiners leaned closer 
to watch the examination and accidentally turned on the tap above the sink ( Fig. 3.6 ). 
 • Leaving your bag on the fl oor might also be problematic. Many an examiner has 
been anxious that a candidate might walk backwards, trip over his or her bag and be 
impaled by a patella hammer ( Fig. 3.7 ). 
 • During the assessment of the patient by the examiners, one examiner mocked the 
old-fashioned stethoscope of his colleague: ‘You have a 19th-century stethoscope and 
I have a 21st-century one,’ he said. On going to examine the patient with his electronic 
stethoscope (not usually allowed to candidates), he stopped and said, ‘Ah, the battery 
is fl at.’ ‘Don ’ t worry, you can borrow mine,’ said his helpful colleague. If you have 
permission to use one, make sure it is charged. It would be embarrassing to have to 
ask to borrow the examiner ’ s. 
 • During practice sessions, it is always a good idea to place equipment in the same 
pockets each time. In the exam, you do not want to be fumbling at this crucial time – it 
will only create a poor impression. Consultants, other than cardiologists, carry their 
stethoscopes or put them in their coat pocket; rarely do they place them around their 
neck. Th is seems a sensible policy for aspiring consultants also. Candidates who do 
carry a briefcase into the test (and many neurologists carry one everywhere) can usually 
place it on the patient ’ s bedside table and leave it open so that its contents are easily 
accessible.

3 • The clinical examination
 Travel 
 Most candidates fl y in to the examination city on the day before their exam. At least 
one candidate arriving in jeans and a T-shirt found that his luggage, containing his suit 
and tie, had been sent by the airline to Hawaii (or somewhere). It was too late to buy 
more clothes. He sat the exam in these casual clothes, having explained to the exam 
organisers what had happened. Th e story had a happy ending, but the anxiety caused 
by such an occurrence is probably best avoided. Carry your exam clothes onto the aeroplane 
with you. Check, however, that there is nothing in your exam bag that will disturb the 
airport security people. Th ey are easily alarmed. 
 Appearance 
 Dress is important. Th e medical establishment is well known for its conservatism, and 
the non-verbal messages that your appearance gives should not be forgotten when 
dressing. Traditionally, men and women wear a conservative suit and men a non-committal 
tie. Almost all examiners wear suits and ties (or perhaps a bow tie). In fact, a suit (for 
both men and women) is a sort of uniform and by far the easiest clothing to wear. Th e 
most important thing is not to wear something that will make you feel self-conscious 
and distract you from performing well in the exam itself. 
 Other important considerations for men are having short tidy hair, a neatly trimmed 
beard if you cannot bear to shave it off , and a neutral smell. Dress formally, with care 
to project an air of quiet effi  ciency. White coats are never worn. However, being well 
dressed is no guarantee of success. Th ere is a story of two male candidates, wearing grey 
suits and with recently cut hair, who were viewing with satisfaction a third examinee 
whose long hair was tied neatly in a bun and who was dressed in a fl owing Kaftan-like 
garment – they felt their own success assured with such competition. However, it turned 
out that they were unsuccessful and their colleague passed. 
 It is important that clothing used in the exam fi ts properly. Th e examiners were once 
alarmed to see a candidate whose suit was either borrowed from a smaller person or 
which had not kept up with his weight gain. When he bent over to examine the patient, 
his shirt and trousers separated and the examiners thought he must have had a previous 
career as a plumber.

 1.  Remember your bag lock combination number. 
 2.  Do not place your bag on a sink (or behind you on the ﬂ oor). 
 3.  Make sure all your batteries are charged. 
 Nerves 
 Some candidates take beta-blockers on the day of the test to remain calm. An interesting 
story from the  Lancet highlights this very situation. A Scottish physician refers to a 
British censor who had the habit of counting the temporal pulse of candidates: if he 
found that the pulse rate was less than 60 beats / minute, he would take this fact into 
account when giving his mark. 3 We are unaware of a similar practice in Australasia. 
However, candidates intending to use these drugs should give themselves a dose during 
a practice session. One doctor who did not do this learnt to his horror during the actual 
examination that beta-blockers caused him severe bronchospasm (he failed). Another 
was so bradycardic after doubling the dose to calm his exam nerves that he felt less than 
tip-top. Everyone is anxious before the exam starts but you need some anxiety to drive 
an excellent performance. 
 Nervous individuals with a tendency to sweat can have problems. One candidate 
(now a professor), who was balding and wore glasses, found that, during times of intense 
anxiety, rivers of sweat would roll down from his forehead and fog up his glasses, washing 
them from his nose. His solution was antiperspirant (unscented, of course) applied 
generously to the forehead (he passed). 
 The day before 
 Preparation is the key to success. Like an Olympic athlete, obtain plenty of sleep in the 
week before the ordeal, take no alcohol or tranquillisers in the 48 hours before it, and 
do not study during the fi nal 24 hours. Make sure that you eat something before the 
examination and avoid taking a long trip to the examination city on the morning of or 
the night before the test. 
 The impact of COVID-19 
 In 2020, because of the corona virus pandemic, the clinical examination was postponed 
and the split. Th e long cases are to be conducted separately and via video conference 
in November with plans for short cases to be held in early 2021.

 Candidates who do not want to rewrite the whole long-case presentation before facing 
the examiners (time is often a problem) may fi nd it helpful to number the paragraphs 
with a red pen in the order in which they wish to present the story. 
 Many examination centres provide manila folders. Th ese are large enough for candidates 
to be able to write out one whole long case on one folder. Th ey do, however, seem to 
lead to a lot of turning backwards and forwards and folding and unfolding as candidates 
search to fi nd where something was written. Practise with whatever method you choose 
so that it works smoothly. 
 The history-taking and physical examination 
 Once you have said, ‘How do you do?’ to the patient at the beginning of the long case, 
we suggest initially following the steps outlined below. Remember though that there is 
no  single right way to conduct any part of the exam. Th is book is meant only to provide 
a framework upon which candidates can work out what suits them best. Th ese steps 
may help you ascertain rapidly the patient ’ s major problems so that you can direct 
further questioning more easily.
 1.  Explain to the patient that this is a very important examination. Gain the patient ’ s 
interest and support. Th is is a test of bedside manner. 
 2.  Ask the patient ‘What do you see as the main problem with your health at the 
moment?’ If he or she asks, ‘Am I allowed to tell you?’, look confi dent and fi rm and 
say, ‘Yes, of course.’ Candidates are entitled to all the information the patient can 
off er. Th e examiners will usually similarly instruct the patient to tell the candidates 
all they can. Patients are told by the examiners not to give any written information 
such as referral or specialist letters to the candidate. Expect more than one problem. 
 3.  Ask the patient for a list (single word answers) of the other health problems they 
have. In the setting of multiple problems, confi rm the main issue by asking ‘What 
is troubling you most now?’ Do record and note in your presentation the problem 
the patient considers most important. Th e problems the patient fi nds troubling should 
appear somewhere in the problems list you give to the examiners, even if some are 
less interesting issue in terms of the patient ’ s health. 
 4.  Ask why the patient is in hospital this time (i.e. is he or she an inpatient or outpatient?) 
and, if relevant, the presenting symptoms when he or she was admitted. Th e majority 
of patients are brought in specifi cally for the examination. Exam organisers have been 
asked to fi nd long-case patients who have active problems suitable for discussion. 
Th is can be diffi  cult and, certainly, patients often have no acute medical problems. 
 5.  Review early on what medications the patient is taking. A full list should be provided 
for you by the examination centre. Use this list to identify any medical conditions 
you may have missed, and sometimes to gauge the severity or prognosis. Th is information 
is, however, not always helpful (see  Table 4.1 ). 
 6.  Ask the patient about any recent tests, again to obtain clues about the current problem. 
 7.  If, as you probe, the patient stops talking, ask, ‘Anything else?’ and repeat as needed. 
 In the majority of long cases, the patient has a chronic illness about which he or she 
may be very well informed. It is sensible to make use of this knowledge, but remember 
the trap that patients may be biased in their opinions and give (inadvertently) false 
information. Be sceptical about patients’ opinions regarding their diagnoses and ask 
questions that will help verify what the patient has said. For example, a patient who 
 
 
35
4 • The long case
says he has had fi ve heart attacks, but has not been admitted to hospital for any of them, 
is probably mistaken. A candidate who merely repeats to the examiners what the patient 
has said without any attempt at interpretation will not pass and is not a sophisticated 
physician. Many experienced patients bring in a typed summary of their medical problems. 
Th e examiners have decided to tell patients to use these as an  aide memoire for answering 
the candidates’ questions, but not to hand them over. Candidates should exercise scepticism 
when patients bring in large amounts of medical information about themselves. Some 
patients have an exaggerated interest in their health and there have been a few suspected 
Munchhausen patients slip into the exams ( Table 4.1 ). It is the sign of a mature candidate 
that he or she can manage ‘diffi  cult’ patients. 
 Having established the main diagnosis early on, confi rm this with specifi c questioning. 
On fi nding symptoms that do not fi t the diagnosis, decide the likely possibilities and 
follow up with further questions. Never blindly believe the patient but don ’ t upset 
patients by doubting them openly. One of the skills of a physician is to obtain information 
and explore all aspects of a patient ’ s illness without causing upset. A history of exotic 
previous illnesses without a history of appropriate investigations or treatment for such 
conditions should prompt a careful and tactful retaking of the history. 
 Next, enquire about other problems. Most long-case patients are chosen because they 
have multiple medical problems. An example might be an elderly woman with interstitial 
lung disease as her major presenting illness who also has signifi cant ischaemic heart 
disease, chronic kidney disease and peptic ulceration secondary to aspirin use. It is a 
terrible experience to discover another major illness only minutes before the end of the 
time. List all the important diseases chronologically and obtain full details about each 
one. Organise the material to present the most important (i.e. often the current) problem 
fi rst, followed by the others in order of importance 
 It is important to appreciate the great amount of detail the examiners will expect 
about the patient ’ s past history. A lot of time needs to be spent on this. Failing to 
uncover a medical problem from long ago that the examiners found when they saw the

patient counts against the candidate. Remember that the patient ’ s history is often well 
rehearsed after the examiners and perhaps another candidate have taken it. 
 If the patient has an illness that can become suddenly severe or life-threatening  – for 
example, asthma or insulin-requiring diabetes  – ask whether there is an  action plan . 
Th at is, does the patient know what to do or whom to contact if he or she becomes 
suddenly worse? All patients should be asked about their immunisation status, including 
infl uenza, hepatitis A and B, herpes zoster and pneumococcus (depending on their age). 
 Do not ever forget the social history. Th is is especially important because the examiners 
(and society) are keen to have caring specialists who are fully aware of the complete 
social environment of their patients. Th e examiners will expect great detail here as well. 
Ask about:
 •  occupation  – now and in the past 
 •  adequacy of income  – particularly if the patient is on a pension, whether the patient 
can aff ord medications and transport to appointments 
 •  current housing arrangements  – e.g. renting, mortgage 
 •  ability to cope and resilience at home and the quality of life if this is a chronic disease 
problem  – the activities of daily living (ADLs) should be assessed 
 •  stress points  – whether there are problems in the patient ’ s life that make coping with 
the illness much more diffi  cult, e.g. threatened loss of a driver ’ s licence 
 •  depression  – it is reasonable to ask patients whether the illness or other problems have 
been associated with depression, loss of interest in life and even suicidal thoughts, 
but be tactful; also consider anxiety. Don ’ t miss post-traumatic stress disorder in a 
returned war veteran 
 •  mobility  – particularly the number of steps that need to be climbed at home and at 
work, and on which fl oor of the building the patient lives 
 •  hobbies  – e.g. contact with animals, chemicals or dust 
 •  marital status and number of children (from which partners) 
 •  sexual problems  – particularly ask about erectile dysfunction in men if indicated (e.g. 
patients with diabetes) 
 •  end-of-life decisions  – discussion of this may be appropriate if the patient has an 
incurable disease 
 •  place of birth and  overseas travel in relationship to the illness 
 •  immunisation status and whether the patient has a general practitioner. 
 A family history must also be taken. Th is sort of information is easy to obtain and fi lls 
in discussion time neatly, but disaster can threaten if the candidate does not know it. Th e 
most important aspects of the social and family history should be outlined in the initial 
presentation and the rest kept in reserve to be unleashed if the examiners show an interest. 
 Th ere has been recent debate about the need for candidates to take a detailed sexual 
history. In reality this is necessary only if it is related directly to the patient ’ s medical 
problems (e.g. someone with HIV infection). It would not be usual for a doctor to take 
this type of history during a fi rst consultation, except in these circumstances. If asked 
why you had not taken a more detailed sexual history, a reasonable answer would be 
that it was not directly relevant and that your usual practice is to wait until you know 
the patient better before asking questions of this sort. 
 As you examine the patient, always ask when the examiners came, what parts they 
examined and whether any comments were made about the signs. One candidate was 
told by his patient that during a fundoscopic examination the examiner had said to the 
other: ‘Look, a Roth ’ s spot!’ However, this is no substitute for a thorough examination. 
 Even though you should spend most time on the relevant systems, remember that 
unexpected signs will sometimes crop up, such as a large breast mass, gross papilloedema 
 
 
37
4 • The long case
or an abdominal mass. Th e examiners always have in front of them a list of the signs 
and have always gone to the trouble of checking that, in fact, these signs are present. 
You will be expected to have found all the important signs, so be thorough. Any equivocal 
fi ndings should probably be ignored. Ask the bulldog for the results of the urinalysis 
and rectal examination; you are not expected to perform these personally. Also, don ’ t 
forget to take the patient ’ s blood pressure at some stage and check for a postural change, 
if at all relevant (e.g. diabetes mellitus). 
 Practise performing quick screening tests, such as GALS (gait, arms, legs and spine 
( Ch 9 )) as a test of mobility, and have an approach to assessing diabetic patients for 
their possible vascular and neurological complications quickly. 
 At the end of the history-taking and physical examination, always ask the patient: 
‘Is there anything else you think I should know?’ Amazingly, important information is 
often volunteered at this point. Th en ask yourself: ‘Could this be anything else?’ and 
‘Can I tie all the multisystem problems into one disease?’ (usually you can ’ t in an older 
person, but this may be possible in a younger patient). 
 During the 20 minutes or so remaining, decide what type of case it is  – that is, is it 
a  treatment problem or a  diagnostic problem, or both? Sort out the active from the 
inactive problems. Draft your introductory statement  – for example, ‘I saw Mrs J Smith, 
a 30-year-old woman, who presents for the treatment problem of active rheumatoid 
arthritis and also with the diagnostic problem of jaundice’. 
 Next, mentally rehearse presenting the history and examination concisely and clearly. 
Th ere is a tension between detail and brevity in the presentation of the patient. Experience 
and practice will help you get this right. Your concluding statement should reiterate the 
problems (in order of importance). It is usual to end the presentation by requests for 
relevant investigations. Always formulate a diff erential diagnosis, even if the history and 
examination lead to a defi nite diagnosis. Create a list of the fi ndings on history and 
examination that support (or refute) the diagnoses considered. If a positive diagnosis 
cannot confi dently be made, try to decide on the most likely diagnosis. 
 Th e discovery of a major problem with a particular long case (e.g. a patient with 
obvious dementia) shouldn ’ t lead to panic. By recognising the problem, fully examining 
the patient and having a plan of management (fi nding reversible causes, eliciting from 
relatives the social set-up, etc.), you will pass. One candidate who was faced with a 
demented patient in the long-case examination became angry and complained bitterly 
to his examiners. He failed. 
 Occasionally there are other diffi  culties, such as language problems (usually the candidate 
is supplied with an interpreter) or the patient becomes ill during the time (cardiac arrests 
have occurred). Be sure to inform the bulldog of any diffi  culties; people will go out of 
their way to be fair in such circumstances. Th e examiners will make a note of any such 
problems on their scoresheet, so that this can be taken into account by the executive 
later on. As the fi rst question, the lead examiner will ask the candidate if there were any 
problems with the patient during the case. Th is is not the time to complain about the 
patient. Th e examiner will know if the patient was a diffi  cult historian. However, if there 
were problems, such as late arrival of the patient or the patient ’ s need to leave the room 
a number of times to go to the toilet, this should be mentioned, but not dwelt upon. 
 The presentation 
 Your whole presentation to the examiners should take 10 – 12 minutes. Never go 
longer. Leave out any irrelevant detail; padding the presentation never impresses. Avoid 
 
 
38
Examination Medicine
repetition  – for example, mentioning various medications as a part of the history of a 
particular system and then later as part of a long general list. Try not to use the brand 
names of drugs. 
 Th e physical examination fi ndings usually take only a few minutes to present. Avoid 
giving long lists of normal fi ndings, but make sure the examination fi ndings in the 
systems aff ected are thorough. 
 Th e examiners are only human too: sometimes they are hungry, tired or just bored 
after previous presentations (particularly if yours is the last long case of the afternoon). 
Show interest and enthusiasm while speaking. Th ink of yourself as a newsreader and 
speak at a speed that allows the examiners to keep up and take notes. Do not read your 
notes in a monotone. Look up from your notes to make eye contact with the examiners. 
Th e notes are meant to help your memory. Break up the pace and include a pregnant 
pause after you make an important point (for emphasis). 
 Ideally, the long case should be a discussion between consultants, with the candidate 
being a respectful junior colleague. Th e examiners only rarely interrupt during the 
presentation. If your presentation is taking too long and there will not be time for discus-
sion you will usually be interrupted and asked to summarise. Remember, aim to have 
fi nished presenting the case in less than 12 minutes. 
 Most examiners expect the candidate to fi nish the presentation with a list of the main 
problems the candidate thinks should be discussed in order of importance. Th is list of 
priorities is one of the domains used by the examiners when marking a candidate. Th e 
examiners will expect you to have asked the patient what he or she thinks is the most 
important problem with his or her health at the moment (they will certainly have done 
so) and to put that close to or at the top of the list of problems. 
 It is likely that the examiners will want to discuss the patient ’ s active problems. Th ey 
will almost always want to talk about the problem the patient sees as most important. 
Th ese should be the areas of management that you are best prepared for. It is very 
unsatisfactory for examiners to feel that they have not been told all the major problems, 
and what the management plan for each problem is, by the end of the discussion. At 
the end of your presentation, and before discussion of management, the lead examiner 
may ask some questions to clarify aspects of the history or examination fi ndings. Th is 
should be no cause for alarm. After this, you are usually given the opportunity to outline 
a plan of management, or the examiners may ask specifi c questions. Examining styles 
diff er, but you should strive to direct the discussion tactfully. Being allowed to do this 
is usually a good sign, but not being allowed to control the discussion is not necessarily 
a bad sign. Some candidates appear to think that if they speak quickly and loudly enough 
they may prevent the examiners from asking any questions. Th is strategy does not work. 
Th e exam is meant to be a discussion and if the examiners cannot ask questions the 
candidate cannot score marks. 
 When appropriate, ask for one or two important investigations relevant to the problems, 
rather than rattling off  a rote list of routine tests. Examiners fi nd a long list irritating 
and consider it a sign of an immature approach.  A reason should be given for ordering 
every test. For a diagnostic problem it may be useful to ask for the results of previous 
investigations. Any mentioned test may have to be discussed in detail with the examiners. 
Sometimes the examiners will not give you the results of a test (they may not have it 
available), but merely ask how it would help you. We suggest that you write down the 
results you are told (it is embarrassing to have to ask for the fi gures to be repeated). Don ’ t 
ignore any information that is given; for example, if the haemoglobin value is normal, 
comment on this and explain how it helps. Many examiners will have underlined or 
marked the relevant results from a printed pathology or biochemistry report. Th is is to 
 
 
39
4 • The long case
avoid wasting time as a candidate wades through a series of irrelevant results. Concentrate 
on the marked results. Remember not to touch X-ray fi lms or criticise the quality of 
the material shown. Pathological specimens are not shown in the clinical examinations. 
 Always prepare answers to obvious lines of questioning and try to think like a consultant 
physician who is in charge of the patient ’ s care (and hypothesise that the patient is a 
close relative of the examiner). If there is a diagnostic dilemma, consider the tests you 
want and how positive and negative results will support or refute your proposed diagnoses. 
In a management case, prepare an outline of the suggested treatment and be able to 
justify it. A good approach to management if the patient is an inpatient is to ask yourself, 
‘What steps will be required to get this patient home?’ Always set management goals 
for all key therapeutic interventions. Th e examiners may ask about theoretical aspects 
of the condition. Most often, they will concentrate on the testing of factual knowledge 
in areas that are necessary for the formulation of adequate management decisions or 
interpretation of test results. You should think about these areas beforehand. Always 
consider whether the patient ’ s current treatment is justifi ed and whether the diagnosis 
previously made is consistent with the history and examination; it may not be. Do not 
be afraid to contradict the current management in a restrained way, if there is clear 
justifi cation. Sometimes the patient ’ s current management seems entirely appropriate; 
it is quite reasonable to tell the examiners that is the case. 
 A common series of questions for many long cases involving chronic diseases includes 
aspects of how you would discuss the illness and the prognosis with the patient. Th e 
examiners might ask: ‘What would you tell Mrs Smith about her prognosis and likely 
future treatment?’ and ‘What would you advise her about the safety of future pregnancies?’ 
 Th e examiners will not usually ask hypothetical questions unrelated to the patient 
being discussed. If you are answering well, the line of questioning may change or the 
depth may become overwhelming. Do  not be frightened to say, in the latter situation, 
‘I don ’ t know’, when asked a very diffi  cult question. Obvious wild guesses will be 
detrimental. If the examiner persists in asking a question, it usually means he or she is 
trying to establish a basic fact. Talk sensibly around the topic  – often a supplementary 
question will result in recall of the appropriate information. With an especially diffi  cult 
issue it is reasonable to say you would consult the literature or an appropriate sub-specialist 
for advice. Remember that examiners are instructed to avoid making snap judgements 
or failing candidates because of one small mistake. Th e best examiners will not labour 
a point. If it is clear you do not know the answer they will move on to another series 
of questions. Th is does not mean you have failed, but rather gives you the opportunity 
to gain marks elsewhere. 
 You must be able to discuss sensibly anything that you mention in a viva, so don ’ t 
casually allude to rare diseases that you know nothing about (e.g. kala-azar as a cause 
of massive splenomegaly). 
 When the case includes a diagnostic problem the discussion should revolve around 
the diff erential diagnosis. A good approach is to talk about the possible diagnoses, with 
what seems the most likely fi rst, and to give reasons from the history, examination and 
test results that are in favour of or against each possibility. 
 The long-case rationale 
 Th e long case is a test of the candidate ’ s ability at history-taking, physical examination, 
interpretation of fi ndings and construction of a diagnosis (and diff erential diagnosis), 
and approach to management (investigation and treatment). Important and common

 Remember the point of the long case. The examiners want to know if you can:
 •  take a comprehensive and accurate history in an orderly fashion 
 •  perform a thorough and efﬁ cient physical examination without missing important 
signs 
 •  work out what this particular patient ’ s problems are in a sensible order of importance, 
taking into account the patient ’ s own priorities and the effect of these problems on 
the patient and his or her family 
 •  order properly thought-out investigations and interpret the results 
 •  work out a differential diagnosis that takes into account all this information 
 •  create a plan for the management of this patient ’ s problems that seems sensible 
and makes the examiners conﬁ dent you are ready to go on to advanced training and 
can look after new patients in hospital, clinics or rooms. 
in  Chapters 5 – 13 . Some other relevant aspects are dealt with in  Chapter 16 . Th ese cases 
are presented as single problems, but most patients will have a combination of problems. 
Some problems tend to occur together. 
 It would be unusual not to see at least one patient with type 2 diabetes on the 
examination day. Th ese patients are often obese and have diabetic complications and 
problems related to their obesity, such as vascular disease or arthritis. A common question 
to be asked about such patients would be fi tness for surgery such as for a joint replacement. 
Another likely case is a transplant patient. Transplant patients have many similar problems 
as well as the specifi c problems related to their particular organ failure and original 
illness. For example, a kidney and pancreas transplant patient may have complications 
of previous diabetes mellitus. Scleroderma may be a rare disease but it is common in 
the examination. It is worthwhile making an eff ort to fi nd and assess the patients with 
the types of chronic diseases that repeatedly crop up, and have a systematic approach 
worked out for their management. 
 Candidates are often very well prepared for common types of long cases and are able 
to produce a formulaic response to a trigger word such as  diabetes or  transplant. Th e 
examiners are then given a rote list instead of management directed at the particular 
patient. It is important always to relate these management lists to the actual patient and 
adapt them as required. Such an approach refl ects the maturity expected at this level. 
 Another common problem faced by the examiners is the excessively detailed social 
history that takes up much of the presentation. Relevant social problems should be 
noted and, if asked, you should be able to provide more detail and discuss the problems 
sensibly; however, attempting to replace the more diffi  cult medical aspects of the patient ’ s 
care with this detail will not lead to a successful long case  – the examiners are on to it.

 •  All important problems are identifi ed. 
 •  Problems are listed in a sensible order of priority. 
 4.  Eff ect of the disease
 •  Th e candidate understands how the patient functions physically and psychologically 
in response to the disease. 
 •  Th e candidate understands the eff ect that the treatment and prognosis has on the 
patient and their family. 
 5.  Management
 •  Th e candidate suggests an appropriate management plan for the major problems. 
 •  Th ere is a sensible approach to investigations. 
 •  Investigations are thoughtfully interpreted. 
 •  Important side-eff ects of the proposed treatment are recognised. 
 Th e various domains are not necessarily of equal weight and will vary in importance 
from one case to another. 
 Types of long case 
 Th e cases in  Chapters 5 – 13 are written as a guide to dealing with the long-case examination 
and are not meant to replace textbook descriptions. To pass, you must really know and 
understand your general medicine, be able to take an outstanding history, examine 
accurately and maturely synthesise all the data. Remember that usually several problems 
occur in the one case. A patient with an unusual diagnosis will often have one or more 
common problems as well. 
 Th e examiners will often ask whether you would like the results of appropriate 
investigations. Be prepared to interpret any results you have asked for. Electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), chest X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans may be shown to candidates. Echocardiograms are not usually shown to 
candidates, but you are expected to be able to interpret echocardiography reports. Some 
common examples are included in  Chapters 5 – 13 and also in  Chapter 16 . At the end 
of each report is a comment that gives an idea of the sort of interpretation expected 
from candidates. 
 Th e key to passing any exam is obviously providing the examiners with what they 
want. Candidates have plenty of opportunity to fi nd out what examiners want. Practise 
cases with examiners and senior registrars. Th e stories (sometimes exaggerated) of previous 
candidates and information from the College are all readily available these days. 
 If you can think like an examiner then you can give them exactly what they want 
(see  Ch 14 ). In essence, what they want is that you should think like a physician. Th e 
College exam is successful at producing people who do think like physicians. Physicians 
from all internal medicine specialties have had a common training experience and this 
makes communication between them easier. 
 Th ere is a list of basic skills and qualities that an examiner wants you to establish 
from your long-case presentation.
 •  Are you safe? 
 •  Do you know what you are doing and what your limitations are? 
 •  If you go on to become a cardiac electrophysiologist, starting next week, do you know 
enough about, say, thyrotoxicosis to cope with it, with help if necessary? 
 
 
44
Examination Medicine
 •  Have you developed a competent approach to the patient who has problems involving 
many sub-specialties? 
 •  Have you an approach to the patient that is sympathetic and practical? Th is means 
knowing at least enough about a patient ’ s non-medical circumstances to understand 
what might aff ect his or her ability to have treatment and how diff erent treatments 
might aff ect the patient  – for example, fi nancially because of a particular occupation. 
 •  Have you recognised the problem that the patient thinks is most important? 
 Th ese simple principles are worth keeping in mind as you interview and examine 
your long-case patient. Th ey should help you work out what the examiners will consider 
important and what sorts of questions they are likely to ask.

of risk stratifi cation is based on these factors and determines the urgency and type of 
treatment. 
 The history 
 1.  Find out whether the patient has been or is in hospital because of a recent myocardial 
infarction or an acute coronary syndrome, or for some other cardiac or non-cardiac 
reason. 
 2.  Th e patients with the worst prognosis are those with chest pain and ECG changes 
at rest ( Table 5.1 ). Clearly, these may represent diff erent pathophysiological states, 
varying from occlusion of a coronary artery and inadequate collateral fl ow to rupture 
of a lipid-rich plaque with thrombus formation. Ask about obvious precipitating 
factors, such as a gastrointestinal bleed or the onset of an arrhythmia. Also ask about 
the character of the chest pain and what precipitated the admission. 
 Remember that the diagnosis of angina can be suspected from the history, but needs 
to be established by investigations – an abnormal ECG or exercise test at least. You 
should be suspicious of the diagnosis unless it has been confi rmed by investigations. Th e 
most common diff erential diagnosis is gastro-oesophageal refl ux disease (GORD). Th is 
can be diffi  cult to prove without endoscopy (and, if normal, oesophageal pH testing), 
but an excellent response to a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is very suggestive. 
Oesophageal spasm is another cause of central chest pain and may respond to nitrates. 
 3.  Detail the patient ’ s current treatment and management history. Oral medications will 
probably include:
 •  aspirin with or without an ADP inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) 
 •  a beta-blocker or occasionally a calcium antagonist 
 •  nitrates (intravenous, oral or topical) 
 •  statin 
 •  an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor 
(AR) blocker (ARB). 
 a.  Acute coronary syndromes are managed with heparin and aspirin, and clopidogrel 
or ticagrelor. Remember that prasugrel should not be used in patients older than 
75 or in patients who have had a haemorrhagic stroke. 
 b.  Th rombolytic treatment is not eff ective for NSTEACS. Th is is possibly because 
acute coronary syndromes are not a single pathological entity and also because a 
state of increased thrombogenesis may follow initial thrombolysis with these drugs. 
 c.  Most patients have early angiography (within 48 hours) with the intention of 
angioplasty to the culprit lesion if this is practical. Ask whether the patient knows 
details of what investigations or treatment were performed.

 d.  If the patient has had an infarct during this or previous admissions, fi nd out about 
the management, which may have included primary angioplasty or thrombolysis, 
and treatment of complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac failure, further angina 
and embolic events. 
 e.  In many hospitals a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program will have been 
off ered to the patient. Ask whether this has been helpful and ask about the hospital 
staff  ’ s explanations to the patient about his or her condition and prognosis. Also 
ask questions about the eff ect of this illness on the patient ’ s life and work. 
 4.  Next, ask standard questions about risk factors in addition to age and male sex. 
Remember that risk factors are of vital importance to long-term prognosis, but add 
little to the likelihood that undiagnosed chest pain is ischaemic. Risk factors include:
 •  previous ischaemic heart disease or previous abnormal CT coronary angiogram or 
calcium score (which may over-diagnose atheroma) 
 •  hyperlipidaemia 
 •  diabetes mellitus (the increased risk in these patients is as high as that in non-diabetics 
who have already had an ischaemic event) 
 •  hypertension 
 •  family history (in particular, fi rst-degree relatives with ischaemic heart disease 
before the age of 60; 92-year-old great-uncles with heart trouble do not count) 
 •  smoking (how many; if stopped, how long ago – risk of infarction is no longer 
increased after 1 year and that of angina after 10 years) 
 •  use of oral contraceptives or premature onset of menopause 
 •  obesity and physical inactivity 
 •  chronic infl ammatory diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, other arthritis, HIV 
infection 
 •  high serum homocysteine levels, which may have been measured if the patient has 
premature coronary disease and few other risk factors – levels in the top population 
quintile increase coronary risk twofold; trials of treatment (mostly with folate), 
however, have been negative and routine treatment is not recommended 
 •  long-term use, in high doses, of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors or other 
non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (which should be stopped) 
 •  erectile dysfunction (which often precedes symptomatic ischaemic heart disease 
and is a marker of endothelial dysfunction). Remember that the presence of multiple 
risk factors is more than additive. 
 5.  Th en fi nd out whether risk factor control has been successful. Remember the important 
results of recent secondary prevention trials.
 a.  Aggressive cholesterol lowering to below a level of 4 mmol / L of total cholesterol 
(low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  < 1.8) is now considered appropriate for patients 
with established coronary disease. 
 b.  Th ere is some evidence that statins have benefi cial eff ects beyond their eff ect on 
lowering cholesterol levels (via anti-infl ammatory eff ects). 
 6.  Find out what investigations the patient can remember.
 a.  An echocardiogram may have been performed to assess ventricular function and 
possible complications of infarction, such as a pericardial collection, a left ventricular 
thrombus, mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect (VSD). 
 b.  An exercise test, a sestamibi or a stress echocardiogram may have been performed 
to assess ischaemia or myocardial viability (MRI scan). 
 c.  Cardiac catheterisation is perhaps the most memorable of the investigations for 
ischaemic heart disease and if negative suggests a cause other than coronary artery 
disease (e.g. pericarditis). 
 
 
48
Examination Medicine
 Th e patient may know how many coronaries are abnormal and whether angioplasty 
was performed. Ask whether a drug-eluting stent (DES) was used and for how long 
dual antiplatelet treatment was recommended. Bare metal stent use is now uncommon; 
the superiority of modern DESs is well established. 
 7.  Complications such as acute mitral regurgitation or an infarct-related VSD are usually 
treated surgically but have a relatively poor prognosis. All complications are uncommon 
if early coronary patency and normal fl ow have been achieved. 
 The examination 
 Examine the cardiovascular system (see  Ch 16 ).
 1.  Record the blood pressure. 
 2.  Look for signs of valvular heart disease, cardiac failure, rhythm disturbances (e.g. 
atrial fi brillation (AF), frequent ectopic beats) and murmurs suggesting mitral regurgita-
tion or a VSD caused by an infarct. 
 3.  Th ere may be spectacular bruises at venepuncture or femoral or radial puncture sites 
if the patient has had thrombolytic treatment. Abdominal wall bruising suggests 
subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. Occasionally the radial pulse 
may be absent after radial angioplasty. More general complications include a stroke 
due to embolism from the heart. 
 Management 
 Discuss the management of the presenting problem. If the patient has only recently 
been admitted with an infarct, this means a discussion of thrombolysis and primary 
angioplasty.
 1.  Candidates should have some knowledge of the major thrombolysis and angioplasty 
trials.
 a.  Th ese have shown that early treatment has improved mortality. Treatment up to 
12 hours after the onset of an infarct is worthwhile. 
 b.  Alteplase and reteplase have been shown to produce a small survival advantage 
compared with streptokinase, probably because they are more eff ective in 
opening occluded vessels, but have a slightly increased risk of causing cerebral 
haemorrhage. 
 c.  Alteplase is given as a bolus followed by an infusion, and reteplase is given as a 
double bolus injection with a 30-minute interval. Tenectaplase is given as a single 
injection. In many states ambulance offi  cers can give thrombolysis according to a 
rigorous protocol and usually after transmitting the patient ’ s ECG to a central 
location for confi rmation of ST elevation. Even when thrombolysis seems successful 
(resolution of symptoms and ST depression) patients are now routinely transferred 
so that angiography can be performed as soon as practical. 
 2.  Urgent coronary (primary) angioplasty, if available, is of proven benefi t and has been 
shown to reduce mortality compared with treatment with thrombolytic drugs.
 a.  Th e advantages, theoretical and real, include defi nite re-opening of the infarct-related 
artery in more than 90% of patients (compared with  < 60% of patients given 
thrombolytics), normal fl ow in the infarct-related artery in most cases, dilatation 
and stenting of the off ending (culprit) lesion and often removal of clot, very low 
risk of stroke and shortening of hospital stay, often to just 3 days. 
 b.  Patients are treated with potent antiplatelet drugs: aspirin, clopidogrel (or ticagrelor) 
and sometimes with one of the platelet aggregation inhibitors, abciximab or tirofi ban. 
Ticagrelor is more rapidly eff ective than clopidogrel and in most protocols is now 
preferred for primary angioplasty patients. It improves prognosis compared with 
 
 
49
5 • The cardiovascular long case
the other drugs. Its most common side-eff ect is dyspnoea, which may develop after 
5–10 days. 
 c.  Th ere is now trial evidence that transport of patients to a hospital where this 
procedure can be performed is preferable to treatment with thrombolytic drugs, 
if transport time is less than 2–3 hours. 
 d.  Rapid transport to the catheter laboratory is important and the ‘door to balloon’ 
time should be less than 90 minutes when angioplasty is available in the hospital 
to which the patient presented. 
 e.  Recent trials have not shown a benefi t for routine thrombus aspiration for primary 
angioplasty procedures. 
 3.  If the history has suggested complications resulting from the infarct, these will have 
to be discussed. Common complications include:
 •  ventricular arrhythmias 
 •  bradyarrhythmias (especially following an inferior infarct) 
 •  cardiac failure 
 •  further ischaemia or re-infarction. 
 It is important to have planned an approach to the management of these 
problems. 
 Investigations 
 Th ese are aimed at assessment of the infarct size, complications and presence of further 
ischaemia:
 1.  left ventricular function – echocardiogram (ejection fraction, wall motion abnormality), 
left ventriculogram 
 2.  complications – echocardiogram for valvular regurgitation, left ventricular thrombus, 
infarct-related VSD 
 3.  further ischaemia – exercise test, sestamibi stress test, cardiac catheterisation 
 4.  viability – MRI scan, sestamibi scan. 
 Long-term treatment 
 1.  Early revascularisation is of proven benefi t for high-risk patients with acute coronary 
syndromes (ST elevation, troponin elevation). 
 2.  Prognosis is improved with aspirin, beta-blockers and, for large infarcts (ejection 
fraction  < 40%), ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers (e.g. carvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol 
and extended-release metoprolol). 
 3.  Be prepared to discuss balloon versus stent versus surgery versus do nothing invasive. 
Patients with three-vessel disease and signifi cant left ventricular damage or with left 
main coronary artery stenosis benefi t prognostically from coronary artery bypass 
surgery even if their symptoms have settled on medical treatment. Th ose with tight 
proximal (before the fi rst diagonal branch) left anterior descending lesions probably 
also benefi t from surgery or angioplasty. Consider suggesting discussion at a heart 
multidisciplinary team meeting if the lesions are complex. 
 4.  Eplerenone, an aldosterone antagonist, is indicated for patients with cardiac failure 
following an infarct. 
 Secondary prevention 
 1.  Control of cardiac risk factors is even more important once the presence of coronary 
artery disease has been established. It should be a routine part of the management. 
 2.  Dietary advice for weight and lipid reduction may be indicated. Lipid-lowering drug 
treatment with a statin should be introduced for all patients who can tolerate it. 
 
 
50
Examination Medicine
 3.  Patients should be encouraged to take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program, if this 
is available, where advice about safe exercise, weight reduction and changes to dietary 
and smoking habits can be encouraged. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How would you quantify and manage  this patient ’ s future cardiac risk? 
 2.  What would you advise a surgeon or anaesthetist about the risks of surgery for  this 
patient?
 a.  How would you manage his or her antiplatelet treatment in the perioperative 
period? 
 Revascularisation 
 For some long-case patients with ischaemic heart disease the emphasis will be on 
revascularisation (coronary surgery or angioplasty). Th ese procedures are so common 
that many patients with other presenting problems will have had them. 
 The history 
 Similar information to that outlined in the ischaemic heart disease long case is required.
 1.  Careful questioning about risk factor control, both before and after surgery or angio-
plasty, is very important. Th e patient should know whether he or she has ever had 
an infarct and may know whether there was signifi cant left ventricular damage. 
 2.  Find out what procedure (or procedures) the patient has had and whether there has 
been complete relief of symptoms. 
 3.  If coronary artery surgery was performed, ask how many grafts were inserted and 
whether internal mammary or other arterial (e.g. radial artery) conduits were used. 
It may be possible to work out from the history whether surgery was performed to 
improve symptoms or prognosis (e.g. three-vessel or left main disease), or both. 
 4.  Th e patient may know how many vessels were dilated if angioplasty was performed 
and whether stents were inserted. Th e patient should know whether bare metal stents 
(BMSs) or drug-eluting stents were used. Ask whether the angioplasty was performed 
in the setting of a myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. Find out for 
how long dual antiplatelet treatment was prescribed. 
 The examination 
 Examine the patient as for the ischaemic heart disease long case.
 1.  Note the presence of a median sternotomy scar. Patients who have had a left internal 
mammary artery (LIMA) graft often have a numb patch to the left of the sternum. 
Th is may be permanent. 
 2.  Look at the sternal wound for signs of infection; osteomyelitis of the sternum is a 
rare but disastrous complication of surgery. Look and feel for sternal instability. Sternal 
wires are often palpable. 
 3.  Examine the arms for the very large scar that results from radial artery harvesting. 
 4.  Examine the legs for saphenous-vein-harvesting wounds. Infection and breakdown 
of these wounds are more common than for the sternal wound. 
 
 
51
5 • The cardiovascular long case
 Management 
 SURGERY 
 Use of the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to graft the left anterior descending 
(LAD) coronary artery has been routine for more than 20 years. Other arterial conduits 
are used less often, but ‘all arterial revascularisation’ is performed routinely in some 
centres or where saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) are not possible (e.g. previous coronary 
artery bypass graft (CABG) or varicose veins in both legs and thighs). In these cases the 
right internal mammary artery (RIMA) may be used, usually to graft the right coronary, 
or the radial artery is used as a free arterial graft. Th e RIMA may also be used as a free 
graft attached to the aorta, if that is necessary to make it reach. Th ere is excellent evidence 
that LIMA grafts have a higher long-term patency rate ( > 90% at 10 years) than SVGs 
(50% at 10 years). Th ere is less information about other arterial conduits. 
 In general, CABG is better than angioplasty for patients with three-vessel disease and 
diabetes (improved mortality, fewer re-interventions, fewer infarcts). 
 In response to the increasing numbers of angioplasty procedures, surgeons have begun 
to perform fewer invasive bypass procedures. Th e most widely used alternative is the 
‘off -pump’ LIMA graft to the LAD coronary artery. A median sternotomy incision is 
still used, but the LIMA is attached to the LAD coronary artery on the beating heart. 
A ‘Y’ graft from the LIMA to the circumfl ex and right coronaries can be performed 
using the RIMA attached to the LIMA. Th ese operations avoid the need for cardiopul-
monary bypass, speed recovery and possibly reduce the risk of intraoperative cerebral 
events. Minimally invasive bypasses are carried out in some centres. A series of lateral 
chest incisions are used as ports for surgery using thoracoscopic equipment. Th e technique 
is not easy and the chest wound, although small, is not necessarily less painful than a 
median sternotomy. 
 Angina may recur at any time after CABG. Very early angina suggests a technical 
problem, such as mammary artery spasm, thrombosis of an SVG, grafting of the wrong 
vessel, or grafting of the correct vessel but proximal to the area of stenosis. Sometimes 
revascularisation may be ‘incomplete’ because one or more vessels were unsuitable for 
grafting – usually because of distal disease in the target vessel. 
 Recurrence of angina is more common if risk factors have not been aggressively 
controlled. Low-dose aspirin has also been shown to prolong graft survival and patients 
with severe diff use disease are often given dual antiplatelet treatment by their surgeons. 
When angina recurs, the patient usually describes symptoms similar in character to the 
old ones. Recurrent chest pain that is diff erent from the old angina is less likely to be 
ischaemic. 
 ANGIOPLASTY 
 Angioplasty is now performed more often than surgery in many centres. It has not been 
shown to improve the prognosis for patients with stable angina receiving optimal medical 
treatment ( Table 5.2 ). 
 Many angioplasties are performed to provide symptom relief for patients with one- or 
two-vessel disease. Patients with acute coronary syndromes, and especially those with 
raised troponin levels, are treated with early angioplasty. Th ere is now good evidence 
that this group of patients has an improved prognosis (fewer deaths and fewer large 
infarcts) and a shortened hospital stay when treated aggressively in this way. 
 Dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) has made subacute stent thrombosis a rare event 
( < 1%). DAPT is ideally given for 48 hours before angioplasty and for at least 4 weeks 
afterwards; 6 months to a year is often recommended for patients who have had an 
acute coronary syndrome or a drug-eluting stent. 
 
 
52
Examination Medicine
 For patients treated for an infarct or acute coronary syndrome, a loading dose of 
180 mg of ticagrelor or 300–600 mg of clopidogrel or 60 mg of prasugrel is given. 
 Patients should continue with aspirin forever.
 •  Optimal medical treatment is as good as angioplasty in terms of prognosis when 
there is one- or two-vessel disease (excluding left main and proximal LAD). 
 •  However, angina is better controlled by an angioplasty. 
 •  If angioplasty is performed only when ischaemia has been demonstrated by measurement 
of the fractional fl ow reserve by a fl ow wire in the catheter laboratory, angioplasty 
improves outcome compared with optimal medical treatment. 
 FREQUENT TRIAL 
 Drug-eluting stents have dramatically reduced the incidence of restenosis. Th e currently 
available stents have either everolimus or sirolimus bound via a polymer to the metal 
surface of the stent. Th ese antineoplastic drugs are eluted for about a month and prevent 
the migration of smooth muscle cells into the lumen of the vessel that is the cause of 
restenosis. Very low restenosis rates of a few per cent have been obtained in trials, even 
when diabetics are included. Th ese stents also seem to be eff ective in preventing further 
restenosis when used in a restenosed bare metal stent. Drug-eluting stents (DESs) are 
more expensive but more eff ective than bare metal stents and are now routinely recom-
mended for almost all patients. Th e current generation of DES has a lower thrombotic 
risk than BMS and DAPT can usually be suspended if necessary at 3 months. Th eir 
use for patients taking warfarin or a novel (non-vitamin-K antagonist) oral anticoagulant 
(NOAC) is complicated, but most protocols take into account bleeding risk and thrombotic 
risk. Generally, 1 month of triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and the NOAC or 
of warfarin is followed by 11 months of clopidogrel and lower dose NOAC or warfarin. 
For patients at high bleeding risk, aspirin may be omitted. Th e more potent ADP agent, 
ticagrelor, should be avoided. 
 Patients presenting with a STEMI or non-STEMI who are being treated with 
warfarin or a NOAC present a diffi  cult problem. Current recommendations are to 
continue warfarin, use a radial approach for the angioplasty if possible and then use 
DAPT and oral anticoagulation (increased bleeding risk) or clopidogrel and warfarin, or 
NOAC only. 
 Stents do not set off  metal detectors and patients can safely have an MRI scan within 
a month. 
 It is reasonably safe to suspend a second antiplatelet drug (as long as aspirin is 
continued) at about 3 months for a patient to have urgent surgery when a modern 
DES has been used. Heparin is not a substitute for antiplatelet treatment for these 
patients. 
 Table 5.2   Optimal medical treatment for stable angina 
 1.  Aspirin  + /  − clopidogrel (for 1 year post ACS) 
 2.  Statin – target LDL 1.8 mmol / L 
 3.  ACEI or ARB at maximum tolerated dose 
 4.  Beta-blocker – heart rate down to  < 70 
 5.  Hypertension treated to  < 130 / 80 
 6.  Exercise 3 times a week at least for  > 150 minutes / week 
 ACS  = acute coronary syndrome; ACEI  = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB  = angiotensin II 
receptor blocker.

5 • The cardiovascular long case
 Infective endocarditis 
 Patients with infective endocarditis (IE) stay in hospital for weeks, so are often available 
for long cases. Th e disease presents diagnostic, plus short-term and long-term management 
problems. Cases combine cardiological, microbiological and immunological problems. 
Th e diagnosis is usually known to the patient. An intravenous infusion containing 
antibiotics is a valuable clue. 
 Th ree-quarters of cases are caused by streptococci or staphylococci. 
 The history 
 Ask about:
 1.  details of presenting symptoms (e.g. malaise, fever, symptoms of anaemia) 
 2.  symptoms suggesting embolic phenomena in large vessels (e.g. brain, viscera) or 
small vessels (e.g. kidney, with haematuria or loin pain) 
 3.  recent dental, endoscopic or operative procedures – a precipitating event is identifi ed 
in only about 5% of cases (the time between procedure and diagnosis may be up 
to 3 months); remember that  Streptococcus gallolyticus ( S. bovis ) or  Clostridium septicus 
endocarditis is associated with colonic cancer and these patients all deserve a 
colonoscopy 
 4.  use of antibiotics for prophylaxis, either before an invasive procedure or for rheumatic 
fever, or both 
 5.  a past history of rheumatic fever 
 6.  a history of other heart disease or heart operations, especially valve replacement 
 7.  a history of intravenous drug abuse, particularly for its association with tricuspid 
and pulmonary valve infection 
 8.  antibiotic allergies 
 9.  how the diagnosis was made – including the number of blood cultures and the use 
of transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) 
 10.  management since admission to hospital, including the names of the antibiotics 
used, the duration of treatment and whether the possibility of valve replacement 
has been discussed 
 11.  a history of other major diseases, particularly those associated with immune sup-
pression, such as renal transplantation or steroid use. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How would you manage  this patient ’ s anticoagulation during a future presentation 
with an acute coronary syndrome? 
 2.  How would you manage this patient ’ s anticoagulation for atrial ﬁ brillation following 
his recent angioplasty? 
 HINT 
 The examiners will not expect you to know how to perform an angioplasty, but they will 
want you to know how to manage risk factors and antiplatelet treatment.

 •  20% of endocarditis patients have no recognised underlying cardiac abnormality 
 •  coronary stents and pacemaker leads do not appear to involve any risk of

 3.  Examine for the signs of cardiac failure. Look for signs of a prosthetic valve and for 
scars that may be present from previous valvotomy or repair operations. 
 4.  Look for a source of infection and take the patient ’ s temperature. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Th ree sets of blood cultures each from a diff erent site over 24 hours (98% of culture-
positive cases will give positive results in the fi rst three bottles). 
 2.  Full blood count (FBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): look for anaemia 
(normochromic, normocytic), neutrophilia, an elevated ESR, which may be  > 
100 mm / h, and a raised C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Th e ESR tends to remain 
elevated for months, even when treatment has been successful, but the CRP level 
falls quite quickly and may be useful for assessing the eff ectiveness of treatment. 
 3.  Renal function: a freshly spun urine sample will often show red cell casts but is 
rarely assessed these days. 
 4.  Chest X-ray fi lm: look for left ventricular (LV) or right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, 
increased pulmonary artery markings, Kerley B lines, frank cardiac failure and valve 
calcifi cation (lateral fi lm). Th e onset of heart failure is a poor prognostic sign.

 6.  Echocardiography ( Fig. 5.3 ) ( 2-D and Doppler ) : vegetations must be larger than 
2 mm to be detected. Th is procedure cannot distinguish active from inactive lesions. 
Vegetations are seen in approximately 40% of cases. Th ey tend to occur downstream 
of the abnormal jet (e.g. on the aortic surface of the aortic valve in cases of aortic 
stenosis and endocarditis). Colour Doppler examination is a very sensitive means of 
detecting new valvular regurgitation, which may be an important sign of endocarditis. 
 Transoesophageal echocardiography allows better defi nition of valvular involvement and 
is more likely to detect vegetations. Perhaps more importantly, it is much more likely 
to detect such complications as valve abscesses. It is in routine use for the assessment 
of cases of known or suspected endocarditis. 
 Notes 
 ORGANISMS 
 Streptococci account for approximately half of these infections.
 1.  Viridans streptococci (often referred to by the pseudotaxonomic term ‘Streptococcus 
viridans’) – usually presents subacutely. Current important types for endocarditis 
include  S. sanguinis ,  S. gordonii and  S. mitis . 
 2.  Streptococcus faecalis – traditionally more common in older men with prostatism 
and younger women with urinary tract infections, but now in intravenous 
drug users. 
 3.  Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. bovis) – associated with colon polyps and carcinoma. 
 4.  Staphylococcus aureus – particularly in intravenous drug users; usually presents acutely. 
Note, though, that only a small minority of  S. aureus bacteraemias are associated 
with endocarditis. 
 5.  Staphylococcus epidermidis – more common in patients with recent valve replacement 
but can be a contaminant in blood cultures. 
 6.  Gram-negative coccobacilli – rarely a cause; more common with prosthetic valves. 
Th e responsible organisms are called the HACEK group:
 H aemophilus 
 A ctinobacillus 
 C ardiobacterium hominis 
 E ikonella spp. 
 K ingella kingae 
 7.  Fungi (e.g.  Candida ,  Aspergillus ) – particularly in intravenous drug users and immu-
nosuppressed patients. 
 CAUSES OF CULTURE-NEGATIVE ENDOCARDITIS 
 Note: Th is diagnosis should be made with caution. It condemns a patient to prolonged 
treatment with intravenous antibiotics.
 1.  Previous use of antibiotics. 
 2.  Exotic organisms (e.g.  Haemophilus parainfl uenzae , histoplasmosis,  Brucella ,  Candida , 
Q fever). 
 3.  Right-sided endocarditis (rarely). 
 POST-VALVE SURGERY ENDOCARDITIS 
 Early infection is acquired at operation; late infection occurs from another source. Th is 
condition has a worse prognosis than native valve endocarditis.

Comment
The diagnosis of endocarditis cannot really be made on the basis of echocardiography alone. 
Even what appears to be a vegetation may be sterile. Nevertheless, a mobile mass attached to 
a valve in a patient with positive blood cultures makes the diagnosis of endocarditis almost 
certain.
An abnormal echocardiogram adds weight to the diagnosis. It also enables detection 
of left ventricular enlargement, which suggests haemodynamic compromise. Serial 
echocardiograms allow assessment of the treatment of endocarditis and help with the 
decision about the timing of possible surgery.
The underlying valve abnormality may be obvious. Here the aortic valve is congenitally

 Diagnosis 
 Th e diagnosis is usually a clinical one. Th e modifi ed Duke criteria are often used to 
assist. Two major criteria, one major and three minor, or fi ve minor criteria secure the 
diagnosis. 
 MAJOR CRITERIA 
 1.  Typical organisms in two separate blood cultures. 
 2.  Evidence of endocardial involvement: echocardiogram showing a mobile intracardiac 
mass on a valve or in the path of a regurgitant jet, or an abscess or new valvular 
regurgitation. 
 3.  Transoesophageal echocardiogram: recommended for patients with a prosthetic 
valve and at least possible IE by clinical criteria; recommended for other patients 
initially. 
 4.  Single positive blood culture for  Coxiella burnettii or anti-phase IgG antibody 
 > 1 : 800. 
 MINOR CRITERIA 
 1.  Predisposing cardiac condition or intravenous drug use. 
 2.  Fever. 
 3.  Embolic vascular phenomena or stigmata. 
 4.  Serological or acute phase abnormalities. 
 Treatment 
 Early involvement in the management by a cardiac surgeon in a cardiac surgical unit is 
usually indicated, particularly for staphylococcal infection.
 1.  Intravenous administration of a bactericidal antibiotic. If the organism is a sensitive 
viridans streptococcus, give benzylpenicillin, 6–12 g daily for 4–6 weeks. If it is an 
enterococcus, at least 4 weeks of intravenous treatment are necessary and the choice 
of antibiotic depends on the organism ’ s sensitivity (e.g. a cell wall active drug such 
as a beta lactam plus a synergistic aminoglycoside such as gentamicin). For prosthetic 
valves, 6–8 weeks of intravenous treatment are necessary. 
 2.  Follow the progress by looking at the temperature chart, serological results and 
haemoglobin values. 
 3.  Th e decision to go on to valve replacement is a diffi  cult one; it is best made with the 
assistance of a cardiac surgeon who has been involved from the start. Indications for 
surgery include:
 a.  resistant organisms (e.g. fungi) 
 b.  valvular dysfunction causing moderate-to-severe cardiac failure (e.g. acute severe 
aortic regurgitation) 
 c.  ongoing fever and persistently positive blood cultures in spite of treatment 
 d.  invasive paravalvular infection causing conduction disturbances, or a paravalvular 
abscess or fi stula (detected by TOE) 
 e.  recurrent major embolic phenomena, although this is controversial (an isolated 
vegetation is not in itself an indication for surgery). 
 Factors suggesting a poorer prognosis 
 1.  Shock. 
 2.  Congestive cardiac failure. 
 3.  Extreme age. 
 4.  Aortic valve or multiple valve involvement.

5 • The cardiovascular long case
 5.  Multiple organisms. 
 6.  Culture-negative endocarditis. 
 7.  Delay in starting treatment. 
 8.  Prosthetic valve involvement. 
 9.  Staphylococcal, Gram-negative and fungal infections. 
 Differential diagnosis 
 1.  Atrial myxoma. 
 2.  Occult malignant neoplasm. 
 3.  Systemic lupus erythematosus. 
 4.  Polyarteritis nodosa. 
 5.  Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. 
 6.  Pyrexia of unknown origin. 
 7.  Cardiac thrombus. 
 Prognosis 
 Prior to antibiotic use this was an invariably fatal disease. Currently, more than 70% 
of patients with endogenous infection survive, as do 50% of those with a prosthetic 
valve infection. Intravenous drug users have a good prognosis. 
 Prophylaxis 
 Confusion between rheumatic fever and endocarditis prophylaxis is common. Rheumatic 
fever prophylaxis consists of long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration. Prophylaxis 
against endocarditis requires high-dose, short-term treatment only in patients with a 
very high risk, namely:
 •  a previous episode of endocarditis 
 •  a prosthetic heart valve or prosthetic material used for valve repair 
 •  a congenital heart malformation (unrepaired cyanotic heart disease, repaired cyanotic 
heart disease with residual defects or recent surgery using artifi cial material (within 
6 months)) or 
 •  a cardiac transplant with valve disease. 
 According to the latest (2007) American Heart Association guidelines, all other lesions 
no longer require prophylaxis. 
 Prophylaxis is also recommended according to the Australian (Heart Foundation) 
guidelines for:
 •  complex congenital heart disease, including patients who have had repair operations 
using shunts or artifi cial material and have persisting shunts (e.g. VSD repaired with 
Gortex, but with residual shunt) 
 •  Aboriginal patients with any intermediate- or high-risk lesion. 
 Prophylaxis regimens are as follows (recommendations from  Th erapeutic guidelines 
– antibiotic ):
 1.  Dental procedures (e.g. periodontal procedures) or oral surgery: amoxycillin 2 g, 
1 hour before the procedure. For patients unable to take oral antibiotics, use ampicillin 
IV 15–30 minutes before the procedure. For those allergic to penicillin, cephalexin 
2 g orally 1 hour before the procedure is adequate. 
 2.  Gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, or bronchosocopy: no prophylaxis 
is recommended unless infection is already present. 
 Remember that the eff ectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis has not been proven. 
Patients need to be reminded of the need for good dental hygiene and regular dental 
review.

superimposed on interstitial oedema. A lamellar pleural effusion (arrow) is seen at 
the right costophrenic angle where Kerley ‘B’ lines are also evident.

 2.  ECG: look for arrhythmias, signs of ischaemia or recent or old infarction ( Fig. 5.5 ), 
left ventricular hypertrophy and persisting ST elevation (aneurysm). Left bundle 
branch block (LBBB) is a common ECG fi nding in these patients ( Fig. 5.6 ). Th e 
ECG is rarely entirely normal in a patient with heart failure. 
 3.  Electrolytes and creatinine levels: to exclude hypokalaemia (as a cause of arrhythmia), 
hyponatraemia (which may indicate severe longstanding cardiac failure, a poor prognostic 
sign) and renal failure. 
 4.  B-type natriuretic peptide level (BNP; previously called brain natriuretic peptide): 
although there is doubt about the reference range, a defi nitely elevated level may help 
distinguish cardiac from non-cardiac dyspnoea. Although BNP is raised in both 
diastolic and systolic heart failure, the levels are lower in diastolic heart failure. As 
BNP falls when heart failure is treated, trials of monitoring BNP are under way as 
a means of assessing the adequacy of cardiac treatment.

ejection fraction can be made. Segmental hypokinesia suggests that ischaemia is the 
cause of the cardiac failure. Doppler echocardiography will usually show at least some 
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation in these patients. Th e presence of more severe valvular 
disease suggests a diff erent aetiology for the cardiac failure. Serial echocardiograph 
measurements of left and right ventricular dimensions can be useful for following 
the patient ’ s progress.

 7.  Cardiac MRI or CT can help assess LV and RV function and MRI, myocardial 
viability. 
 8.  Coronary angiography: this is often necessary to exclude coronary artery disease. 
 9.  Right ventricular biopsy: this may help determine the aetiology in selected patients. 
 Treatment 
 1.  Remove precipitating causes. Atrial fi brillation and other incessant tachycardias can 
be a cause of cardiac failure – tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Th e prognosis is 
good if normal heart rate can be restored. Very frequent ventricular ectopic beats 
(VEBs; more than 5000 in 24 hours) can be a cause of heart failure.

Comments
This echocardiography report demonstrates the typical findings when a patient has cardiac 
failure caused by previous anterior myocardial infarction. The left ventricular dysfunction 
is not global (typical of cardiomyopathy) but involves the infarcted area. There is overall 
LV dilatation with an increase of the LVEDD. The FS is the percentage change in LV size 
from diastole to systole measured at the base of the heart. It can be in the normal range 
despite the presence of LV dysfunction, if the base of the heart is not involved.
 
 
65
5 • The cardiovascular long case
The ejection fraction can be estimated from the LVEDD and LVESD measurements. There 
are a number of formulas, which are applied automatically by the calculation software of the 
echocardiograph machine. It is difficult to obtain an accurate ejection fraction, which is a 
volume change measurement on the basis of two 2D-image measurements. These calculated 
ejection fractions tend to have a higher reference range than those obtained by nuclear heart 
pool scanning. MR is almost always detected when moderate LV dysfunction is present.
Mitral annular calcification is a common finding in elderly patients; it can be associated 
with MR, but not with mitral stenosis. The presence of left atrial enlargement suggests that 
the mitral regurgitation is not acute, but can also be associated with hypertension.
TR is commonly found in patients with heart failure, but may also be present in normal 
people. Interrogation of the regurgitant jet with continuous wave (CW) Doppler allows 
measurement of its velocity. This can be used to calculate the pressure difference across 
the valve. Since the pressure in the right atrium is usually close to 5 mmHg, the pressure 
in the RV can be calculated by adding 5 to the pressure difference. In this case the pressure 
difference across the valve is about 33 mmHg.

 2.  Correct underlying causes if possible (e.g. angioplasty for an acute infarct or coronary 
artery bypass grafting or angioplasty for ischaemia) ( Table 5.3 ). Restore sinus rhythm 
or control the heart rate. Ablate the VEB focus. 
 3.  Control the failure.
 a.  Decrease physical activity (e.g. bed rest for the acutely ill patient). 
 b.  Control fl uid retention (e.g. by diuretics, low-salt diet, fl uid restriction (1000–1500 mL 
for severe failure)).
 •  Patients should be advised to weigh themselves daily. An increase in weight of 2 kg 
or more over a few days is usually an indication of signifi cant fl uid retention. A 
temporary increase in the diuretic dose will often prevent deterioration in symptoms. 
 c.  Oppose inappropriate activation of the renin–angiotensin system.
 •  ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) are considered to be the drug class of choice for cardiac 
failure as they prolong life; symptomatic hypotension is the major side-eff ect in 
cardiac failure. ACEIs are indicated for all classes of heart failure, even for 
asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Every eff ort should be 
made to titrate the dose up to the maximum tolerated. Th e usual limitation is 
symptomatic hypotension. 
 •  AR blockers (ARBs) are indicated for patients intolerant (usually because of 
cough) of ACEIs. Th e most common reason for the cessation of ACEIs or ARBs 
is deterioration in renal function (usually in patients with renovascular disease). 
Some deterioration in renal function is usually acceptable. 
 •  Th e combination of an ARB and a neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril / valsartan is 
the fi rst one approved) has been shown more eff ective than an ACEI or ARB 
and may be used as fi rst-line treatment for heart failure patients or as a replacement 
for an ACEI or ARB.

 •  Renal function may improve again if the ACEI and diuretic doses are reduced 
and hypovolaemia is corrected. Th ere is little therapeutic diff erence between the 
various ACEIs. 
 •  Trials have also demonstrated some additional benefi t when ACEIs and ARBs 
are combined. Th e treatment of cardiac failure involves polypharmacy. It is 
probably only a minority of patients who will be prepared to take an ARB, as 
well as all the other drugs usually prescribed. Th e combination also seems to 
increase the risk of acute renal failure and is rarely used. 
 •  Add spironolactone. Th is aldosterone antagonist improves survival in class III 
or IV patients. It may be especially useful for the management of ascites and 
peripheral oedema. Hyperkalaemia may be a problem for patients with renal 
impairment. Start with 12.5 mg per day. Eplerenone is a newer aldosterone 
antagonist indicated for heart failure occurring soon after myocardial infarction. 
 
 
67
5 • The cardiovascular long case
 •  Asking the patient about the diffi  culties of adherence with a complicated drug 
regimen may be useful at this point. 
 d.  Oppose inappropriate increases in catecholamine drive.
 •  Give beta-blockers. Trials with carvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol and extended-release 
metoprolol have shown improvements in symptoms and mortality for this drug 
used in patients with class II–IV heart failure. 
 •  Th e drugs must be introduced at a low dose (e.g. 3.125 or 6.25 mg BD of 
carvedilol or 1.25 mg daily of bisoprolol) and titrated upwards as tolerated to 
25 mg BD of carvedilol or 10 mg daily of bisoprolol. 
 e.  Increase myocardial contractility (e.g. with digoxin). 
 Note: Th e use of digoxin in cardiac failure is again controversial. Recent trials 
have suggested an increase in symptoms if cardiac failure patients who are in sinus 
rhythm and on treatment with digoxin, diuretics and ACEIs have their digoxin 
withdrawn. Re-assessment of digoxin mortality trials has suggested a possible increase 
in mortality for patients taking digoxin. Patients most likely to benefi t symptomati-
cally have more severe heart failure, an S3 gallop, impressive cardiomegaly and an 
ejection fraction  < 20%. 
 f.  Intravenous inotropes (e.g. dopamine or dobutamine) may have a place in the 
short-term treatment of severe cardiac failure. Patients may be admitted for a 
‘dobutamine holiday’ (a course of treatment with intravenous dobutamine, usually 
for about 5 days) and have improved symptoms for some months. Levosimendan is 
an intravenous drug that works as a calcium channel activator. A 24-hour course may 
improve symptoms and possibly prognosis. No eff ective oral inotrope is available. 
 g.  Control rhythm. Remember, severe cardiac failure has a poor prognosis. About 50% 
of these patients die suddenly of a ventricular arrhythmia. Th e detection of high-grade 
ventricular arrhythmias is an indication for an  implanted defi brillator , which is associated 
with a proven improvement in prognosis. Routine use of these devices in patients with 
a low ejection fraction has been shown to improve survival, even when ventricular 
arrhythmias have not been recorded. Th ere is controversy about the prophylactic use 
of these devices in elderly patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. 
 h.  His bundle pacing in selected patients can resynchronise LV contraction. 
 i.  Cardiac transplantation may now be off ered to certain patients. Th e reduced 
availability of donor hearts and the improvement with beta-blockers of many 
patients who would otherwise be suitable for transplant have reduced the frequency 
of this procedure. 
 j.  Biventricular pacing or cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is helpful for 
heart failure patients with very wide QRS complexes. Th e LV-pacing wire is placed 
via the coronary sinus into one of the left ventricular veins. Th is complicated 
procedure enables both ventricles to be paced and dyssynchronous contraction of 
the ventricles associated with a very wide QRS to be corrected. About 70% of 
patients improve with the treatment. Although echocardiographic measurements 
of dyssynchrony are available, they have not yet been able to predict a response 
to resynchronisation treatment and the current guidelines allow their use for 
symptomatic patients with LBBB who are in sinus rhythm. 
 k.  Ventricular assist devices are sometimes used as a bridge to transplant in very ill 
patients. Survival for weeks or months is possible with these devices. Trials of 
entirely artifi cial hearts continue in small numbers of patients. 
 4.  Correct iron defi ciency. A number of studies have shown improvement in symptoms 
when patients who are iron defi cient but not anaemic have their iron stores replenished 
with intravenous iron.

Examination Medicine
 Diastolic heart failure (heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction) 
 Most breathless patients with heart failure have abnormal left ventricular systolic function, 
which is characterised by dilatation and hypokinesis. Some cases of cardiac failure, 
however, may be caused by diastolic dysfunction. In such cases, the myocardium is stiff , 
often because it is hypertrophied and does not relax normally. Th e condition seems to 
be more common in elderly patients. Hypertension is a common cause but infi ltration 
of the heart with amyloid protein is common in elderly people and is an important 
cause. Th e diagnosis is diffi  cult, but an echocardiogram will show preserved or increased 
systolic contraction without dilatation and there may be increased left ventricular thickness 
due to hypertrophy or infi ltration and left atrial dilatation. Doppler echocardiography 
may show abnormalities of left ventricular fi lling caused by the stiff ness of the ventricle. 
However, this is not easy to quantify and is dependent on variations in preload and 
afterload. Technetium scanning has been shown to be reliable in making the diagnosis 
of amyloid infi ltration. Th e ECG typically shows low voltages in the chest leads where 
one would expect high voltages if the problem were left ventricular hypertrophy. 
 Th e condition may have a prognosis as bad as that of systolic heart failure. Treatment 
is similar, but beta-blockers are used early on and only small doses of diuretics should 
be required. Aldosterone antagonists reduce exacerbations and admissions, and the 
ARB-neprolysin inhibitors may subtly improve NYHA class and exacerbations. At least 
in theory, digoxin should be avoided if the patient is in sinus rhythm. Every eff ort 
should be made to control hypertension. 
 Hyperlipidaemia 
 Hyperlipidaemia may be present in patients under investigation for vascular disease, 
pancreatitis, hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus. It often presents both diagnostic and 
management problems. It is not likely to be the major problem for a long-case patient. 
 The history 
 1.  Th e patient should be able to indicate whether or not the main problem is vascular. 
If the problem is one of premature coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolaemia is 
the likely lipid problem. Th e most important inherited cause is  familial hypercholes-
terolaemia , which is caused by a defective or absent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
receptor. Th e heterozygous form occurs in about 1 person in 500. As the transmission 
is autosomal dominant, the patient may know of fi rst-degree relatives who have been 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Would you recommend that  this patient have an implanted deﬁ brillator or resyn-
chronisation pacemaker? 
 2.  How would you help  this patient manage his or her symptoms of cardiac failure 
from day to day? 
 3.  How would you investigate  this patient with a recent worsening of symptoms of 
heart failure?

aff ected. Th ere may even be family members with the homozygous form. Th ese people 
usually present with a tenfold elevation in serum cholesterol levels as a result of an 
increase in plasma LDL levels and have a myocardial infarction before the age of 20 
years. People with the heterozygous form typically have myocardial infarctions in 
their 30s and 40s and have a two- to threefold elevation in cholesterol level. More 
than 80% of aff ected men and nearly 60% of aff ected women have had myocardial 
infarcts by the age of 60 years. Find out whether the patient has already had a 
myocardial infarct and which relatives have been aff ected. 
 Familial combined hyperlipidaemia is associated with obesity or glucose intolerance 
and may be expressed as type IIa, IIb or IV hyperlipidaemia ( Table 5.4 ). Th is is also 
an autosomal dominant trait. Patients develop hypercholesterolaemia and often 
hypertriglyceridaemia in puberty. Once again, there usually is a strong family history 
of premature coronary artery disease. Th ere is no doubt that an elevated triglyceride 
level adds to the risk of hypercholesterolaemia.

NOTES
 • 
 Apo A-I deﬁ ciency is associated with the absence of plasma HDL and severe premature CAD. 
 • 
 Apo B deﬁ ciency is the defect in abetalipoproteinaemia (autosomal recessive), which is characterised 
by haemolytic anaemia (acanthocytosis), fat malabsorption and neurological defects (proprioceptive 
loss, retinitis pigmentosa). 
 • 
 LCAT deﬁ ciency results in decreased HDL, cloudy corneas and progressive renal disease. 
 apo  = apolipoprotein; CAD  = coronary artery disease; HDL  = high-density lipoprotein; IDL  = intermediate-
density lipoprotein; LCAT  = lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase; LDL  = low-density lipoprotein; PVD  = peripheral 
vascular disease; SLE  = systemic lupus erythematosus; VLDL  = very-low-density lipoprotein.

Examination Medicine
 Familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia is also associated with coronary artery disease. 
Th ese patients have elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels and are usually found 
to have obesity, hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus. Find out whether there is any 
history of these and whether there has been atheromatous disease or vascular disease 
involving the internal carotid arteries and the abdominal aorta or its branches. Ask 
about claudication, which occurs in about one-third of patients. 
 2.  Th e patient may be able to tell you his or her cholesterol and triglyceride levels and 
what they have been in the past. Some patients even know their LDL and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) levels. 
 3.  If there is no history of coronary artery disease and the patient either knows the 
triglyceride level to have been very high or has a history of pancreatitis, the likely 
diagnosis is  familial hypertriglyceridaemia . Th is is also a common autosomal dominant 
disorder and is associated with obesity, hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hypertension 
and hyperuricaemia. Although there is a slightly increased incidence of atherosclerosis, 
this is probably related to diabetes mellitus, obesity and hypertension rather than to 
the hypertriglyceridaemia itself. 
 4.  Ask about the patient ’ s alcohol consumption, any history of hypothyroidism or the 
ingestion of oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Any of these can precipitate a 
rapid rise in the triglyceride level, which may precipitate pancreatitis or the characteristic 
eruptive xanthomas. Between attacks, patients have moderate elevations of the plasma 
triglyceride level. 
 5.  Next, fi nd out about treatment. In familial hypercholesterolaemia, this will have been 
aimed at the cholesterol level itself and at any cardiovascular complications that have 
occurred. Th e patient should be well informed about a low-saturated-fat diet and 
may be aware of side-eff ects from medication usage. 
 6.  Th e need for drug treatment of hyperlipidaemia depends on the lipid levels and on 
the patient ’ s other vascular risk factors. Ask about a family history of premature coronary 
disease (fi rst-degree relatives under the age of 60), previous vascular disease (coronary, 
cerebral or peripheral), smoking and diabetes mellitus. 
 7.  Ask about any history of cutaneous xanthoma. Th ese may have resolved with treatment 
or have been surgically removed. 
 The examination 
 1.  Examine the cardiovascular system. Th ere may be evidence of cardiac failure from 
previous myocardial infarcts or a sternotomy scar from previous coronary surgery. 
Occasionally one sees the scandalous situation of a patient with untreated hyperlipi-
daemia presenting with more angina after initially successful coronary surgery. 
 2.  Look specifi cally for the interesting skin manifestations of these conditions.
 a.  Patients with the heterozygous or homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolaemia 
may have  tendon xanthomas ( Fig. 5.8 ). Th ese are nodular swellings that tend to 
involve the tendons of the knee, elbow and dorsum of the hand and the Achilles 
tendon. Th ey consist of massive deposits of cholesterol, probably derived from the 
deposition of LDL particles. Th ey contain both amorphous extracellular deposits 
and vacuoles within macrophages, and sometimes become infl amed and cause 
tendonitis. 
 b.  Cholesterol deposits in the soft tissue of the eyelid cause  xanthelasma and those 
in the cornea produce  arcus cornea (previously insensitively called  arcus senilis ). 
Xanthelasma occur in about 1% of the population and arcus cornea in 30% of 
people over 50. When corneal arcus is seen in younger people it is more often 
associated with hyperlipidaemia. Surveys of people with xanthelasma indicate a

slightly higher than average cholesterol level. Tendon xanthomas are diagnostic of 
familial hypercholesterolaemia, but the other signs are not as specifi c – only 50% 
of people aff ected have hyperlipidaemia. 
 Th e majority of patients with the homozygous form have even more interesting 
signs.
 •  Yellow xanthomas may occur at points of trauma and in the webs of the fi ngers. 
 •  Cholesterol deposits in the aortic valve may be suffi  cient to cause aortic stenosis; 
occasionally mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation can occur for the same 
reason. 
 •  Painful swollen joints may also be present. Obesity is uncommon in these patients. 
 c.  Th ese skin manifestations may or may not resolve with treatment of the cholesterol 
level. Surgical treatment is sometimes indicated. 
 d.  Eruptive xanthomas are a sign of hypertriglyceridaemia (levels often over 20 mmol / L). 
Th is is type V hyperlipoproteinaemia. Eruptive xanthomas occur on pressure areas, 
such as the elbows and buttocks, and resolve rapidly with treatment. Th e association 
here is with pancreatitis. Th e problem is often hereditary, but exacerbated with 
obesity, diabetes and alcohol consumption. It is a less defi nite risk factor for car-
diovascular disease. Palmar xanthomata are a sign of dysbetalipoproteinaemia (type 
III hyperlipoproteinaemia). Th ey also resolve with treatment. 
 3.  If the history suggests combined hyperlipidaemia or hypertriglyceridaemia, obesity 
is likely to be present. Look also for signs of the complications of diabetes mellitus 
and for signs of hypothyroidism or the nephrotic syndrome (see  Table 11.6 ,  p. 315 ). 
 4.  In sick patients with hypertriglyceridaemia, there may be signs of acute pancreatitis.

Examination Medicine
 Investigations 
 1.  A cholesterol level over 8 mmol / L with a normal triglyceride level suggests one of the 
familial hyperlipidaemias. Th is diagnosis can be confi rmed by an assay of the number 
of LDL receptors on blood lymphocytes. Th e diagnosis is more often made from a 
combination of the lipid pattern, the history and the clinical examination (see  Table 
5.4 ). Th e other necessary investigations are those required for coronary artery disease. 
 2.  Investigation of hypertriglyceridaemia includes tests to exclude possible underlying 
causes, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and excessive alcohol intake. In 
familial hypertriglyceridaemia the plasma triglyceride level tends to be moderately 
elevated to 3–6 mmol / L (type IV lipoprotein pattern). Th e cholesterol level is normal. 
Th e triglyceride level may rise to values in excess of 12 mmol / L during exacerbations 
of the condition. 
 3.  Familial combined hyperlipidaemia produces one of three diff erent lipoprotein patterns 
– hypercholesterolaemia (type IIa), hypertriglyceridaemia (type IV), or both hyper-
cholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia (type V). 
 4.  Familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia (type III hyperlipoproteinaemia) results in the 
accumulation of large lipoprotein particles containing triglycerides and cholesterol. 
Th ese particles resemble the remnants and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) 
particles normally produced from the catabolism of chylomicrons and very-low-density 
lipoproteins (VLDLs). Th e patients are homozygous for the apolipoprotein E2 (apo 
E2) allele, which is unable to bind to hepatic lipoprotein receptors, thus preventing 
the rapid hepatic uptake of IDL and chylomicrons. Th e condition is usually expressed 
only in patients with hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus and tests for these disorders 
are necessary. Apo E genotyping may sometimes be useful. 
 Management 
 1.  A combination of diet and treatment of the underlying condition is usually required. 
Underlying diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism must be treated. 
 2.  Some patients with dysbetalipoproteinaemia respond dramatically to the introduction 
of thyroxine. Eff ective management of the condition tends to cause disappearance 
of the skin signs and improves the prognosis as far as vascular disease goes. Eff ective 
treatment of familial hyperlipidaemia from early adult life delays the onset of coronary 
artery disease. 
 3.  Treatment is almost always begun with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) 
reductase inhibitors (statins, e.g. pravastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin). 
Th ese drugs should be taken at night. Most cholesterol is manufactured at night. 
Th ey work by inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver by impeding the 
activity of the rate-limiting enzyme. Patients need to have their liver function checked 
after about a month. Th ey are eff ective drugs; total cholesterol levels may be expected 
to fall at least 30%. Th e current indications for drug treatment of cholesterol allow 
a statin for patients with established symptomatic coronary artery disease at any 
total cholesterol level.
 a.  Th e most frequent problem with these drugs is the occurrence of myalgias. Check 
the creatine kinase for rhabdomyolosis if there is muscle pain, but this is rare. 
Th e relatively long experience with statins suggests they are safe in quite large 
doses and current starting doses are two to four times those used in the past. 
Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are the most potent statins and should be the drugs 
of choice for severe hypercholesterolaemia. Pravastatin and fl uvastatin are alternative 
options for patients with myalgias, especially if on other CYP3A4 inhibitors. All 
the statins favourably aff ect the HDL:LDL ratio. 
 
 
73
5 • The cardiovascular long case
 b.  Th ere is controversy about the need to treat levels that are already below 4 mmol / L. 
Th ere is evidence that there are pleotrophic eff ects of the statins that reduce coronary 
risk separately from their eff ect on cholesterol. Th is also implies that, for secondary 
prevention, the use of statins may be benefi cial for patients whose total cholesterol 
is below 4 mmol / L before drug treatment. 
 4.  Ezetimibe reduces cholesterol absorption from the gut and thus interrupts its enterohepatic 
circulation. It does not seem to interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. 
Its eff ect on cholesterol levels is substantial, although not as great as that of the statins. 
It is useful for patients who are intolerant of the statins or, when used in combination 
with a statin, for patients whose cholesterol level is not controlled on a statin alone. 
 5.  Gemfi brozil increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase and is useful in hypertriglyc-
eridaemia resulting from increased VLDL or IDL levels. Its main use is for patients 
with elevation of both cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Clofi brate is no longer in 
common use for lipid control. 
 6.  A few patients may be taking one of the bile-sequestering resins – cholestyramine 
or colestipol. Th ey are not absorbed, but can cause constipation and fl atulence and 
can block the absorption of other drugs. Patients may need to take up to two sachets 
(8 g) three times daily. 
 7.  If the cholesterol cannot be brought down to normal levels with diet and a resin, 
nicotinic acid (which blocks VLDL synthesis) can be added. Th is is an eff ective drug 
and may help block the compensating increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis that 
occurs with bile-sequestering resins. It is also used to try to raise HDL levels. Side-
eff ects include fl ushing, pruritus, abnormal liver function tests, hyperglycaemia and 
aggravation of peptic ulcer disease. Th e patient will probably have been begun on 
a small dose and had this gradually increased as tolerance improved. In practice it 
is a very diffi  cult drug to use because of its side-eff ects. 
 8.  A patient with one of the combined hyperlipidaemias is likely to need to lose weight, 
as well as to control the cholesterol and saturated fat intake, and with dysbetalipo-
proteinaemia may require treatment for hypothyroidism. All these patients need to 
avoid alcohol and oral contraceptives. Diet is the mainstay of treatment for reducing 
triglyceride levels; gemfi brozil or one of the newer fi brates may be used if diet fails. 
 9.  Th e indications for treatment of hyperlipidaemia with drugs on the Pharmaceutical 
Benefi ts Scheme (PBS) are complicated. Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride 
levels, as well as the presence of other risk factors, are all part of the formula. 
Candidates should be familiar with the latest PBS rules. 
 10.  A patient with familial hypertriglyceridaemia will have been managed in a similar 
way and may have required treatment for acute pancreatitis. 
 11.  Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia are unlikely to live long 
enough to be present in clinical examinations, but treatment can sometimes involve 
repeated plasma exchange and even liver transplantation. 
 12.  When patients have muscle pains on statin treatment, reducing the dose or even 
giving the drug second daily may be worth trying. However, there are no trials 
showing that second-daily treatment is eff ective. 
 13.  New classes of injectable cholesterol-lowering drugs such as the proprotein convertase 
subtilisin kexin (PCSK9) inhibitors are now available. Evolocumab is a monoclonal 
antibody that inhibits PCSK9 and reduces LDL lipoprotein a (Lp(a)) and apo B 
further when used with a statin. Th is drug is very expensive and is available on the 
PBS for patients with familial hyperlipidaemia, whose cholesterol is not controlled 
with maximum statin doses. 
 14.  Drugs that specifi cally raise HDL have been disappointing.

Examination Medicine
 Hypertension 
 Many long cases are likely to provide the examiners with an opportunity to ask about 
the management of hypertension. Th e examiners will want to hear sensible discussion 
from the candidate about a number of aspects of hypertension, including the diagnosis, 
appropriate investigations and approaches to treatment. 
 The history 
 1.  Many patients are well informed about and very interested in their blood pressure. 
Find out when the diagnosis was made and what sorts of blood pressure readings 
were obtained before and after treatment. It is common for measurements to be made 
in a number of ways and in diff erent settings. Apart from clinic measurements, the 
patient may have taken and continue to take his or her own blood pressure at home. 
Th ere may have been ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) recordings made. It seems 
that hypertensive risk may be more closely related to non-clinic and ABP results than 
to those obtained in the outpatient clinic. ABP should, however, be lower than clinic 
readings to be considered normal. Measurements of  < 135 / 85 mmHg during the day 
and  < 120 / 75 mmHg at night are considered normal for automatic blood pressure 
recordings. See  Table 5.5 for the current classifi cation of clinic blood pressure levels. 
 Th ere is current controversy from the SPRINT trial, which used unattended automatic 
blood pressure measurements taken a number of times. Blood pressure readings were 
generally lower than home or surgery readings. Th e trial has led to a lowering of 
recommended blood pressure targets in the United States, but not in Australia or 
Europe, because of no evidence of greater benefi ts. 
 2.  Ask about current and past antihypertensive treatment and about problems or side-
eff ects caused by treatment. Next, fi nd out about possible complications of hypertension. 
Th ese include stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and renal failure. 
 Possible line of questioning 
 Does  this patient need treatment for his or her lipid abnormalities?

5 • The cardiovascular long case
 3.  Occasionally there may be symptoms that suggest a secondary cause of hypertension: 
paroxysmal sweating, palpitations and headache (phaeochromocytoma) or daytime 
sleepiness (sleep apnoea). Rarely, the patient may be aware of a diagnosis of renal 
artery stenosis, coarctation of the aorta or an adrenal tumour. Primary hyperaldosteron-
ism is now more often recognised. 
 4.  Ask about other risk factors for vascular disease, especially type 2 diabetes, but also 
hyperlipidaemia, a family history of premature coronary disease or stroke. Th e presence 
of any of these conditions, or of existing heart failure, coronary or cerebrovascular 
disease, is a strong indication for treatment. 
 5.  Th ere are often a number of factors that contribute to the problem. Th ese include 
obesity, excess alcohol consumption, lack of physical exercise and a high salt intake. 
Other factors, such as cigarette smoking, add to the patient ’ s overall risk. Ask what 
the patient knows about these factors and what eff orts (if any) have been made to 
correct them. Some racial groups have a high risk of premature vascular disease and 
will benefi t more from early and aggressive treatment. Th ese include Aboriginal 
Australians, Torres Strait Islanders and Pacifi c Islanders. 
 The examination 
 See  Chapter 16 . Don ’ t miss Cushing ’ s syndrome. Feel for radiofemoral delay, but this 
is very rare. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Test the urine for protein . Measure the serum electrolyte and creatinine, blood sugar, 
cholesterol and haemoglobin levels. 
 2.  Note the serum potassium . Th e presence of hypokalaemia in patients who are not 
on diuretics should prompt investigations for primary aldosteronism. Measurement 
of plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (PA) levels may be indicated. 
A high PA level and a low PRA level leading to a high aldosterone:renin ratio is 
consistent with primary hyperaldosteronism. Th e test is better performed off  treatment. 
Other causes of hypokalaemia and hypertension include renovascular disease (both 
aldosterone and renin are elevated), Cushing ’ s syndrome, chronic liquorice ingestion, 
Liddle ’ s syndrome and, in the young, renin-secreting cancers (rarely). 
 3.  Ask about snoring . A history of snoring and obesity should be investigated with 
sleep studies for sleep apnoea. 
 4.  Consider a CT angiogram or conventional renal angiogram for patients with 
intractable hypertension (especially young patients) . Th ese are the most sensitive 
tests for renal artery stenosis. Remember, however, that renal artery angioplasty has 
not been shown to improve blood pressure if the underlying problem is atheromatous 
disease. 
 5.  Ask about symptoms consistent with a phaeochromocytoma . Th ese need investigation 
with 24-hour urinary catecholamines. 
 6.  Investigate for Cushing ’ s syndrome if there is any clinical suspicion . 
 7.  Perform an ECG to look for evidence of ischaemic heart disease and for voltage 
changes that suggest left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) ( Fig. 5.9 ). Th e presence 
of LVH on the ECG in hypertensives is associated with an adverse prognosis. Occasion-
ally an echocardiogram is indicated if there is doubt about the presence of LVH. 
 Treatment 
 Th e decision to begin drug treatment is an important one because it is likely to be 
lifelong. Th e current recommendations are that a blood pressure of  > 140 mmHg systolic 
 
 
76
Examination Medicine
or  > 90 mmHg diastolic, or both, warrants a ‘treatment plan’. It is now very clear that 
the aggressiveness of intervention depends very much on factors other than the blood 
pressure level. Th e whole gamut of cardiovascular risk factors must be taken into account. 
 Tables have been published by many cardiovascular societies that show the calculated 
risk of vascular events and the calculated reduction in number of events over time with 
treatment for patients with diff erent risk factors. Th e decision to use drug treatment 
should be based on information of this kind. Typically, calculators of risk take into 
account age, sex, smoking status, level of blood pressure, cholesterol, race and existing 
cardiovascular disease. 
 Except for very severe hypertension, attempts should be made to bring the blood 
pressure down by modifying the factors that are known to increase it. Many patients, 
when faced with the threat of lifelong drug treatment, are amenable to suggestions to 
change the way they live. 
 Primary hyperaldosteronism can be treated eff ectively with spironolactone. Treatment 
of sleep apnoea with an appropriate continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) mask 
can also make blood pressure control easier. 
 Patients with only a mild risk of cardiovascular problems and blood pressure 
 < 150 / 95 mmHg should probably continue with conservative measures and be reassessed. 
However, at higher levels of blood pressure than this, drug treatment should be considered. 
Patients with very high risk (e.g. those with target organ disease or of Aboriginal race) 
should begin drug treatment if the blood pressure remains above 140 / 90 mmHg. Isolated 
systolic hypertension in the elderly (often defi ned as  ≥ 160 mmHg) deserves therapy! 
 BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION WITHOUT DRUGS 
 1.  Weight reduction: on average, 1 kg of weight loss will reduce systolic blood pres-
sure by 2 mmHg. Th e goal should be reduction to a body mass index (BMI) of 
 Figure 5.9   Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy – the R waves are tall in the 
lateral leads and the S waves are deep in the septal leads. There are also lateral ST 
and T wave changes, called a strain pattern.  
 
 
77
5 • The cardiovascular long case
25 kg / m 2 and a waist circumference of  < 94 cm for men and  < 80 cm for women. 
Even lower BMIs should be recommended for some racial groups, such as Asians 
and Aboriginal Australians, whose cardiovascular risk increases at lower BMIs than 
does Europeans. 
 2.  Exercise: 30 minutes of moderately intense exercise (e.g. brisk walking) at least 5 
days a week can lower blood pressure by about 3–5 mmHg. 
 3.  Alcohol: reductions of 4–5 mmHg can be achieved by alcohol restriction to two 
standard drinks per day for men and one per day for women. 
 4.  Salt: reduction in salt consumption to 90 mmol / day can reduce blood pressure 
by more than 5 mmHg. Warn patients that prepared and snack foods are usually 
heavily salted. 
 Th e cumulative eff ect of these measures can be considerable, but repeated encouragement 
is likely to be required for patients to achieve them. 
 DRUG TREATMENT 
 Remember that all classes of drugs ( Table 5.6 ) are fairly similar in their eff ect on blood 
pressure. Th e majority of patients will require more than one drug for eff ective blood 
pressure control. 
 Th ere are many factors to be taken into account when a choice of antihypertensive 
drug is made ( Table 5.7 ):
 •  previous intolerance to a class of drugs 
 •  known contraindications to a class of drugs (e.g. renal artery stenosis and ACEIs) 
 •  convenience of drug regimen (e.g. once-daily dosage) 
 •  interaction with other medications (e.g. concerns about bradycardia with beta-blockers 
and verapamil) 
 •  existing medical problems that favour the use of a class of drugs (e.g. cardiac failure 
and ACE inhibitors) 
 •  cost 
 •  possible additional protective eff ects of some antihypertensives (e.g. ACE inhibitors 
and patients who have had a stroke or have diabetes). 
 Th e current Heart Foundation recommendation is that treatment begin with a small 
dose of 2 drugs in a single tablet. An RAS inhibitor plus thiazide diuretic or calcium 
antagonist is a common choice. Some drugs are especially eff ective in combination:
 •  beta-blocker and dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist 
 •  ACE inhibitor or AR antagonist and thiazide 
 •  ACE inhibitor or AR antagonist and calcium antagonist 
 •  beta-blocker and alpha-blocker 
 •  beta-blocker and thiazide.

Examination Medicine
 Fixed-dose combinations of two or even three of these are available: ACEI and thiazide, 
calcium antagonist and ACEI or ARB  + /  − diuretic, beta-blocker and alpha-blocker 
(labetolol). Th ese combinations are not approved for the initiation of treatment. Candidates 
should be familiar with the doses of the common antihypertensive drugs and their 
important side-eff ects. 
 UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION 
 Genuinely uncontrollable blood pressure is rare. It should not be diagnosed unless a 
thiazide is part of the treatment. 
 Consider:
 1.  poor adherence 
 2.  hyperaldosteronism (investigate and add spironolactone 1 ) or other rare primary cause 
(e.g. Cushing ’ s syndrome, coarctation) 
 and recommend:
 1.  attempted weight loss 
 2.  salt and alcohol restriction 
 3.  exercise 
 4.  sleep apnoea treatment (if indicated).

5 • The cardiovascular long case
blood pressure reduction for patients not controlled on four or fi ve drugs, but more 
recent trials were much less impressive. Th e treatment is still experimental. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How would you manage  this patient with uncontrolled hypertension despite prescrip-
tion of three or four drugs? 
 2.  How would you decide that  this patient needs drug treatment for his hypertension? 
 Heart transplantation 
 Cardiac transplantation is now an accepted form of treatment for intractable cardiac 
failure. Numbers of patients who have either had a transplant or are on the waiting list 
for one are available for clinical examinations. Th ose awaiting transplantation are sick 
enough to require frequent admissions to hospital, and those who have had a transplant 
are often re-admitted for various routine investigations. Many patients who would once 
have required a transplant are now stable on treatment with beta-blockers and ACE 
inhibitors. Th erefore, patients on a transplant list tend to have severe heart failure which 
has not responded to medical treatment or resynchronisation pacing. Patients are usually 
well informed about their condition and should be able to supply a lot of useful information 
to the candidate. 
 Although this fact should not be discussed with our surgical colleagues, heart trans-
plantation is technically not a very diffi  cult operation. Improvements in prognosis have 
followed medical advances, particularly in the area of the management of rejection. 
Th e 5-year survival rate is now slightly more than 75% for patients who have received 
a transplant since 1981 and the 1-year survival rate is about 90%. Th e average patient 
survives 15 years, but it is 20 years for a 30-year-old and 12 years for a 65-year-old. 
 As in all transplantation long cases, the examiners will expect the candidate to be 
familiar with the indications for and contraindications to the procedure. It is also 
important to know what investigations are required before a patient can be accepted 
for surgery and to understand the management problems that can occur in patients 
who have had the operation ( Table 5.8 ). 
 The history 
 1.  Try to establish the cause of the patient ’ s cardiac failure. In younger patients, car-
diomyopathy is more likely to be the problem, but nearly half the patients currently 
undergoing heart transplantation have ischaemic heart disease. Rheumatic valvular heart 
disease can also aff ect younger patients. Combined heart and lung transplantation is 
occasionally carried out for patients with primary pulmonary hypertension or cystic 
fi brosis. It may also be the treatment of choice for some forms of congenital heart 
disease, either in childhood or in adult life; if pulmonary hypertension is present, these 
patients have to be considered for combined heart and lung transplantation. 
 Ask about previous myocardial infarction or angina and whether the patient 
knows the results of cardiac catheterisation. All patients undergoing a transplant are 
required to have cardiac catheterisation. Th ere may have been a preoperative cardiac 
biopsy performed and the patient may be aware of the results of this test. Also ask 
about previous thoracotomies.

 2.  Ask about the patient ’ s symptoms before surgery. Obtain an idea of the exercise 
tolerance and the severity of angina, if present. Th e patient may know the results 
of investigations of cardiac function, such as exercise tests and gated blood pool 
scans, before and after surgery. 
 3.  Ask what treatment the patient was receiving before transplantation, particularly 
the doses of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers (e.g. carvedilol). Find out 
whether frequent admissions to hospital have been necessary and whether intravenous 
inotropes were required. Th ere may have been recurrent ventricular arrhythmias 
before surgery. Treatment may have been with drugs, especially amiodarone, or an 
implanted defi brillator and antitachycardia pacemaker and resynchronisation device. 
Some patients have undergone previous surgery for arrhythmias. Th is may include 
resection of an aneurysm or myocardial resection following ventricular mapping. 
Occasionally, transplantation is used to treat intractable ventricular arrhythmias. 
 4.  Find out how long it is since the transplant was performed. Ask whether there were 
any problems with the surgery – either technical or involving acute rejection. Find 
out how long the patient was in hospital and what further admissions to hospital 
have occurred since the operation. Ask whether a permanent pacemaker was inserted. 
Some patients awaiting transplant may have been given a ventricular assist device 
as a bridge to transplant; ask whether that was necessary.

5 • The cardiovascular long case
 5.  Endomyocardial biopsies are fairly memorable events and the patient should be able 
to tell you how often these have been performed and when the last one was obtained. 
It is now routine to perform them at weekly intervals for the fi rst 3 weeks after 
operation, every 2 weeks for the following month and every 6 months after that for 
patients whose condition is stable. 
 6.  Find out what drugs the patient is taking currently. Transplant patients should not 
require anti-failure treatment, but will, of course, be taking immunosuppressive 
drugs. Almost all patients are now maintained on cyclosporin (ciclosporin); the dose 
is determined by its serum level. Cyclosporin and tacrolimus are nephrotoxic and 
cause hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Newer immunosuppressive drugs include 
mycophenolate and rapamycin (sirolimus). Diltiazem is often used as a cyclosporin-
sparing agent. It dramatically reduces cyclosporin metabolism and therefore the cost 
of treating patients. Often azathioprine is also prescribed and the dose is adjusted 
according to the white cell count. 
 7.  Patients are often well informed about symptoms suggesting rejection – often these 
resemble an attack of pericarditis. Th e patient may know of boosts of prednisone 
that have been given for rejection episodes. Early episodes of rejection are often 
treated with 1 g of methylprednisolone IV for 3 days. Later rejection tends to be 
milder and may respond to an increase in oral steroids. Severe rejection is often 
treated with antithymocyte globulin or the murine monoclonal muromonab-CD3. 
Repetitive rejection may be treated with total lymphoid irradiation or methotrexate. 
 8.  Enquire about complications of immunosuppression ( Table 5.9 ). Many patients are 
also taking regular antibiotics to prevent  Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly  carinii ) 
infection. Cotrimoxazole twice daily 3 days a week is a common regimen. 
 9.  Some general questions about the transplant patient ’ s current life are very relevant. 
Find out how much diff erence has occurred in the patient ’ s exercise tolerance and 
whether he or she has been able to go back to work. If the patient is currently an 
inpatient, fi nd out why he or she has been admitted to hospital on this occasion. 
Ask about the patient ’ s family and how it has coped with the illness and the transplant 
itself. Make some discreet enquiries about the patient ’ s fi nances and whether there 
have been any problems returning to the transplant hospital for the various investiga-
tions required. 
 10.  Ask about routine cardiac catheterisation. Th is is typically performed biannually 
in patients who have had transplants. Coronary artery intimal proliferation can 
cause ischaemic heart disease in the transplanted heart. Because the heart has been

denervated there is not usually any pain. However, there are now patients in whom 
re-innervation seems to have occurred and led to symptoms of angina. Th is allograft 
arteriopathy is one of the most important problems after transplant. It represents 
a rejection phenomenon. Th e condition is usually diff use, but once lesions causing 
40% coronary stenosis have occurred, the prognosis is quite poor: the 2-year survival 
rate is only about 50%. Th e condition is present in 10% of recipients at 1-year 
post-transplant and in 50% at 5 years. Once myocardial infarction has occurred, the 
2-year survival rate is only 10%–20%. Although the disease is a form of rejection, 
it is still considered important that the patient ’ s cholesterol level be kept as low as 
possible. Find out whether the patient knows what his or her cholesterol level is 
and what treatment is being used to keep it low. Intravascular ultrasound is used 
increasingly to detect subclinical vasculopathy and to study the benefi ts of various 
antirejection regimens. 
 11.  Hypertension is another important post-transplant problem. It is associated with 
the use of cyclosporin. Ask about blood pressure control and treatment. 
 12.  Transplant patients have an increased risk of malignancy. Skin cancers (basal cell 
and squamous cell carcinomas) are common. Th ere is also a higher incidence of 
lymphoproliferative disorders. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) 
is an increasingly recognised complication of the immunosuppression required for 
organ transplants. Th e incidence in heart transplant patients is less than that for 
those with liver transplants, but more than that for those with renal transplants. 
Primary or reactivated Epstein–Barr virus infection is thought to be the cause. Th e 
lesions tend to occur in unusual extranodal sites. Reduction in the amount of 
immunosuppression will sometimes help, but antiviral treatment with aciclovir or 
interferon may be necessary. 
 The examination 
 1.  If the transplant has been successful, there should not be many signs. A median 
sternotomy scar will be present. 
 2.  Look for signs of cardiac failure and pericarditis. Pericarditis can be an indication of 
rejection. 
 3.  Note the small scars in the neck at the point of introduction of the endomyocardial 
biopsy forceps. 
 4.  Look for any evidence of Cushing ’ s syndrome from steroid therapy. 
 5.  Examine the chest carefully for signs of infection, examine the mouth for candidiasis, 
look for infection at intravenous access sites and look at the temperature chart. 
 Investigations 
 Th ese depend somewhat on the reason the patient has been admitted to hospital on 
this occasion.
 1.  Endomyocardial biopsies are performed routinely and at any suggestion of rejection. 
Ask about the results of these biopsies. 
 2.  FBC may be indicated because of possible infection and to monitor the azathioprine 
dose. 
 3.  Chest X-ray may show signs of cardiac enlargement, although this is a late sign of 
rejection. Changes of rejection on the ECG include a reduction in voltage caused by 
myocardial oedema or atrial arrhythmias. Sometimes the patient ’ s ECG shows two 
sets of P waves: one comes from the transplanted heart and one arises from the 
residual atrium. 
 
 
83
5 • The cardiovascular long case
 4.  Recent assessments of myocardial function, including gated blood pool scans and 
resting or stress echocardiograms, may be available. 
 5.  Routine coronary angiography may have been performed. 
 6.  If there have been problems with possible infection, results of blood, urine and other 
cultures should be sought. 
 Management 
 Th e discussion should revolve around the patient ’ s current problem or reason for admission. 
However, there is likely to be time to discuss the management of rejection, infection, 
cardiac failure or social problems.
 1.  Rejection may have been suspected because of pleuritic chest pain, deterioration in 
left ventricular function or ECG changes. It is diagnosed on the basis of a routine 
biopsy. Th e usual approach is to give the patient a boost of methylprednisolone – usually 
1 g intravenously daily for 3 days – followed by a repeat biopsy. 
 2.  Infections occurring as a result of immunosuppression are a major cause of death. 
Possible episodes of infection should be investigated thoroughly and treated aggressively 
with appropriate therapy. Opportunistic infections are relatively common as a late 
complication. Cytomegalovirus, herpes,  P. jirovecii , fungal infection, and  Nocardia 
and  Toxoplasma are all more common than in non-immunosuppressed people. 
 3.  Further cardiac failure may be an indication of rejection, which should be treated. 
Cardiac failure may also be an indication of silent myocardial infarction. 
 4.  Hyperlipidaemia should be sought routinely and treated most vigorously with drugs 
and diet. 
 Th ere may be discussion about the patient ’ s prognosis. Th e 1-year survival rate 
after transplant is about 90% and the 5-year survival rate is about 75%. Th e 10-year 
survival rate approaches 50%. 
 Th e discussion of a patient awaiting cardiac transplantation will probably run along 
similar lines. However, it is important to know how well informed the patient is 
about what is likely to happen, whether he or she appears to fulfi l the criteria for 
transplantation (see  Table 5.8 ) and whether there appear to be any contraindications. 
Some patients awaiting transplantation are sick enough to require intravenous inotropes. 
Th ere may even have been talk about the use of external circulatory assistance devices 
for use as a bridge to transplant. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How have  this patient and his or her family dealt with this complicated illness? 
 2.  What would make you suspect a rejection episode and how would you manage it? 
 Cardiac arrhythmias 
 Th e management of some cardiac rhythm disturbances is complicated. Th ese patients 
may be in hospital while waiting for diagnostic tests or, in cases of serious arrhythmias, 
for treatment to become eff ective. 
 Th ey sometimes represent diagnostic but more often management problems. Ventricular 
arrhythmias are a more common reason for admission than supraventricular arrhythmias, 
but patients with the latter may be awaiting diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Atrial

fi brillation (AF), the most common of the signifi cant cardiac arrhythmias, is unlikely 
to be the patient ’ s only problem if it appears in a long case. 
 The history 
 Ask why the patient is in hospital – all may be revealed without much further eff ort. 
Otherwise, the patient may know the name of the arrhythmia or be able to describe 
symptoms that make the diagnosis likely. If the rhythm problem is a serious and continuing 
one, the candidate may be fortunate enough to fi nd the patient on an ECG monitor. 
 Possible presenting symptoms include:
 1.  rapid and irregular palpitations – suggest AF ( Fig. 5.10 ) 
 2.  rapid and regular palpitations, with or without dizziness and perhaps terminated by 
Valsalva manoeuvres – suggest supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) ( Fig. 5.11 ) 
 3.  rapid and regular palpitations with dizziness, syncope or near syncope – suggest 
ventricular tachycardia (VT),  particularly if there is a history of ischaemic heart disease 
 4.  syncope with bradycardia or no palpitations – suggests heart block ( Fig. 5.12 ) 
 5.  symptoms of AF and episodes of syncope – suggest sick sinus syndrome 
 6.  a family history of sudden death – suggests the possibility of congenital long or short 
QT interval ( Fig. 5.13 ), Brugada syndrome (channelopathy) or a structural cardiac 
problem such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
 7.  the occurrence of syncope in association with antiarrhythmic drug treatment – suggests 
the possibility of proarrhythmia; ask about class 1C drugs and sotalol, perhaps prescribed 
because of paroxysmal AF, as these drugs may also worsen bradyarrhythmias in patients 
with sick sinus syndrome. 
 Ask about previous known heart disease (e.g. ischaemic heart disease and VT, aortic 
stenosis and heart block) and recent cardiac, thoracic or abdominal surgery.
 •  Cardiac surgery may be complicated by heart block and all of the above may 
precipitate AF.

patient with recurrent syncope, suggests that intermittent complete heart block may 
be the cause of the symptoms.

been repaired.

 1.  Has the patient required intravenous drugs to control the heart? Have these been by 
infusion or by bolus injection? Intravenous adenosine is now the drug treatment of 
fi rst choice for SVT. Patients may well remember its use. It causes a brief but distressing 
sensation of impending death. 
 2.  Have physical manoeuvres been tried? 
 3.  What oral drugs have been used in the past and during this admission? Make enquiries 
about the known side-eff ects of these drugs. 
 Figure 5.14   Sinus rhythm. Wolff–Parkinson–White conduction. The PR interval is 
short and delta waves are visible. There are positive delta waves in lead I – seen as 
a slurred upstroke at the start of the R wave – and negative delta waves in lead III 
– seen as a slurred Q wave. These patients’ ECGs are usually abnormal between 
their attacks of tachycardia but the  pre-excitation (delta wave) may occur only 
intermittently. They are at risk of sudden death or syncope if atrial ﬁ brillation or 
ﬂ utter occurs (they are often at increased risk of this arrhythmia) because very rapid 
ventricular rates may occur if the accessory pathway can conduct at high rates. 
Treat acute AF or ﬂ utter in this setting if unstable using electrical cardioversion 
(never use verapamil, adenosine or digoxin).

Examination Medicine
 4.  Th e investigations the patient has undergone or may be about to undergo can help 
sort out the diagnosis.
 a.  Certain tests, such as electrophysiological studies (EPSs), are more memorable 
than others. An EPS with induction of VT may mean that direct current (DC) 
cardioversion was required; despite sedation and reduced cardiac output, some 
memory of this may remain. 
 b.  A cardiac biopsy may have been performed to look for right ventricular cardio-
myopathy (RV dysplasia), a cause of VT. 
 c.  Cardiac MRI, PET and CT scans are commonly used to look for the patchy 
changes of cardiac sarcoid or right ventricular cardiomyopathy (RV dysplasia). 
 d.  Other procedures may have been entirely therapeutic: for example, DC cardioversion 
performed electively under general anaesthesia suggests AF or atrial fl utter; catheter 
ablation, often a fairly prolonged procedure, suggests SVT or VT; pacemaker 
insertion suggests bradycardia; antiarrhythmia surgery suggests VT or, less often 
now, SVT. 
 5.  Catheter ablation is now a routine treatment for SVT that does not respond to simple 
drug treatment. Rarely there may be failure to suppress the arrhythmia, or a complication 
such as complete heart block or cardiac rupture can occur. Ablation is also very 
eff ective for many forms of VT. Th ese include right, and the less common left, 
ventricular outfl ow tract tachycardias. Th ese benign forms of VT can cause frequent 
recurrent episodes of self-limiting VT with LBBB or RBBB morphology, respectively. 
Th ey may respond to treatment with verapamil, but are otherwise managed with 
catheter ablation. VT associated with previous infarction or a cardiomyopathy may 
also be treated with ablation, especially if episodes lead to more than occasional 
activation of the patient ’ s defi brillator. 
 6.  Patients with automatic implantable cardioverter-defi brillators (AICDs) can often provide 
vast amounts of useful information about their devices and about their arrhythmia. 
 Figure 5.15   Sinus rhythm in WPW conduction. The delta waves and overall QRS are 
directed anteriorly in V1, superﬁ cially resembling RBBB. This is type A WPW where 
the bundle of Kent inserts into the left ventricular myocardium. Where the delta 
wave is initially isoelectric, the PR interval appears normal. Note also the close 
resemblance to an inferoposterior infarction.  
 
 
89
5 • The cardiovascular long case
 The examination 
 Examine the cardiovascular system. Is the patient in sinus rhythm clinically? Look for 
thoracotomy scars, pacemakers and implanted defi brillators. Look for signs of cardiac 
failure, valvular heart disease and evidence of recent abdominal surgery or thyrotoxicosis. 
 Investigations 
 Th ese depend on the actual rhythm problem.
 1.  Resting ECG. Look for:
 a.  the current rhythm 
 b.  evidence of pre-excitation (Wolff –Parkinson–White conduction – see  Fig. 5.15 ; 
Lown–Ganong–Levine syndrome) 
 c.  heart block 
 d.  old infarct 
 e.  paced rhythm (ventricular–ventricular inhibited (VVI) or dual-chamber atrial 
sensing and ventricular pacing or dual-chamber pacing) 
 f.  long QT interval (increased risk of polymorphic VT –  torsade de pointes ). 
 2.  Th e examiners may produce previous ECGs or parts of 24-hour Holter monitors. 
Remember that a broad, complex tachycardia should be considered VT unless there 
is good reason to consider otherwise. Th ere are a number of ECG criteria for distin-
guishing VT from SVT with aberrant conduction. 
 Findings suggestive of VT include:
 a.  a QRS  > 0.14 seconds (if a RBBB pattern) or  > 0.16 seconds (if a LBBB pattern) 
 b.  extreme axis deviation (between  − 90° and  ± 180°) 
 c.  atrioventricular (AV) dissociation (with P waves ‘marching through’ the QRS 
complexes) 
 d.  changes from the pre-existing QRS morphology in pre-existing bundle branch 
block (but note, these rules do not apply in SVT with aberration caused by WPW 
conduction). 
 Th e presence of known ischaemic heart disease, or cardiac failure, is particularly 
useful.  Broad complex tachycardia in a patient with ischaemic heart disease is usually 
VT (95%). 
 3.  EPS may be used to assess inducibility of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias before 
and after treatment. It is now used in conjunction with catheter ablation as curative 
treatment for SVT caused by accessory pathways and for some types of VT. It can 
also be performed to ablate the AV node or the regions around the four pulmonary 
veins for patients with intractable and disabling AF. Ablation treatment has an increasing 
role for the management of ischaemic and non-ischaemic VT, usually in conjunction 
with an implanted cardioverter defi brillator. 
 4.  Routine investigations for patients with AF include echocardiography, thyroid 
function testing and sometimes exercise testing. Echocardiography may reveal an 
underlying pathology that is responsible for the AF (e.g. mitral stenosis). It is important 
in helping to quantify embolic risk. Look at the echo for:
 a.  valve abnormalities 
 b.  cardiomyopathy 
 c.  diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (especially important in hypertensive 
patients) 
 d.  left ventricular hypertrophy 
 e.  atrial size (consider atrial septal defect) 
 f.  mitral valve disease 
 g.  segmental wall abnormalities consistent with ischaemic heart disease. 
 
 
90
Examination Medicine
 Tests may be needed because of actual or potential drug side-eff ects (e.g. liver 
function or thyroid function tests for patients on amiodarone). 
 5.  Cardiac catheterisation is often indicated for patients with ventricular arrhythmias, 
as they may have an ischaemic substrate. Patients whose VT has been stable but 
becomes unstable (often leading to more activity on the part of their cardioverter 
defi brillator) may have developed new ischaemia and should have this possibility 
investigated and treated. 
 Management 
 Much depends on the rhythm abnormality.
 1.  Arrhythmias that are not life-threatening are usually managed, at least at fi rst, with drugs. 
Candidates will be expected to have a thorough working knowledge of the common 
antiarrhythmic drugs, their methods of action, indications and side-eff ects. Remember 
that many antiarrhythmic drugs have a potentially dangerous proarrhythmic eff ect. 
 2.  Th e indications for permanent pacing ( Table 5.10 ) and diff erent uses for VVI, VVIR 
(rate-responsive) and DDD (dual-chamber) pacers ( Figs 5.16 and  5.17 ) should be 
well understood. A basic understanding of antitachycardia devices and indications 
for their use ( Table 5.11 ) is also important. 
 3.  Automatic implanted cardioverter-defi brillators (AICDs) are increasingly used to 
manage recurrent VT.
 •  Th ey are often used in combination with antiarrhythmic drugs of some sort. Th ey 
are becoming smaller, cheaper (between $25,000 and $40,000) and more complicated. 
It is now established that they improve mortality rates in selected patients. 
 •  Th ey are usually the treatment of choice for hypotensive VT or missed sudden 
death from VF. Drug treatment of these conditions is not very eff ective. 
 •  Th e current models have leads that can be placed intravenously into the vena cava 
and for pacing purposes into the right ventricle. 
 •  Th ey are small enough to be implanted like pacemakers in the chest wall, but are 
still noticeably larger than pacemakers ( Fig. 5.18 ). Implantation takes place under 
local anaesthetic in the electrophysiology laboratory.

how the device has aff ected the patient ’ s life and confi dence, including how often it 
goes off  and whether the box itself causes problems because of its size. Although AICDs 
can prevent sudden death, their presence is often associated with a feeling of insecurity. 
Patients may have clear memories of events leading up to activation of the device. Th ey 
may avoid places where arrhythmias and activations have occurred. Th ey often require 
repeated explanation and reassurance. 
 Patients who have begun to experience frequent episodes requiring ATP or DC shocks 
need to be assessed ( Table 5.12 ).

 1.  Check programming, e.g. false activations for AF or sinus tachycardia. 
 2.  Exclude new ischaemia. 
 3.  Introduce or increase antiarrhythmic treatment – usually amiodarone or beta-blocker.

 AF  = atrial ﬁ brillation; VT  = ventricular tachycardia. 
 Possible lines of questioning

 The particular management problems of atrial fibrillation 
 Examiners require candidates to have a sensible approach to the management of AF 
and the opportunity for examiners to ask about this common condition will often arise. 
Th e principles of management are to:
 •  maintain sinus rhythm 
 •  control the heart rate (if maintaining sinus rhythm proves diffi  cult) 
 •  protect from embolic events.
 1.  Th ere is good evidence from recent trials that control of heart rate is at least as satisfac-
tory an approach as that of trying aggressively to maintain sinus rhythm. Nevertheless, 
patients with paroxysmal AF often fi nd the arrhythmia very disturbing. Th ey should 
be told at the outset that it may not be possible to keep them in sinus rhythm, but 
that rate control and freedom from embolic episodes can be achieved. Th e prophylactic 
drug treatment of paroxysmal AF involves the use of a class III drug (sotalol or 
amiodarone) in most cases, but occasionally the class 1C drug fl ecainide can be used 
if the patient does not have ischaemic heart disease. 
 2.  Rate control of persistent or paroxysmal AF can be achieved with less-toxic drugs. 
Digoxin is a common fi rst-line treatment and is usually well tolerated. Some recent 
trials have suggested an increased mortality for patients treated with digoxin. It is 
not very eff ective on its own at controlling the heart rate during exercise. Many 
patients with chronic AF have persistent dyspnoea during exercise because of inadequate 
rate control. Th ey benefi t from the use of a beta-blocker or one of the non-
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil). Th ese can be 
used with or without digoxin. Control of the heart rate can prevent or reverse the 
impairment of left ventricular function that is associated with tachycardias (tachycardia-
induced cardiomyopathy). 
 3.  When patients remain unhappy with their symptoms despite rate control, further 
intervention should be considered. 
 4.  DC cardioversion of AF can be a reasonable treatment for the fi rst episode or for 
patients with infrequent episodes. DC cardioversion is safe in the absence of digoxin 
toxicity or hypokalaemia, but is associated with a risk of embolism if the patient ’ s 
AF has been present for more than 48 hours. In this case, 1 month ’ s therapeutic 
anticoagulation should be instituted before the procedure and continued for 4 weeks 
afterwards. An alternative is to perform a transoesophageal echocardiogram to look 
for left atrial appendage thrombus or spontaneous echocardiograph contrast (a sign 
of slow blood fl ow). Th e absence of these means that DC cardioversion is safe, but 
that warfarin must be given for 4 weeks afterwards because there is a persisting risk 
over this period. 
 5.  Reversion of AF with drug treatment is diffi  cult. Many episodes terminate spontane-
ously but drug treatment is given the credit. It is known that digoxin does not 
increase the reversion rate, but the class III drugs and fl ecainide do improve the 
chances somewhat. Sometimes control of the heart rate and awaiting spontaneous 
reversion can be an option. A decision to go on to DC cardioversion, however, 
should be made before 48 hours has passed. 
 6.  Over many years attempts have been made to prevent AF by surgical or catheter 
ablation techniques. Pulmonary vein isolation is now commonly performed for 
intractable symptomatic AF. Radiofrequency energy is used to isolate the two pairs 
of pulmonary veins in the left atrium. Th e rationale for this approach is that almost 
all AF seems to be initiated by electrical activity arising from this part of the heart. 
Isolation of this area from the rest of the heart prevents the initiation of AF. Th e

procedure is complicated and time-consuming (3–4 hours per case). It is not a 
practical solution for most cases of AF. Success rates of about 70% are usually quoted. 
Complications are not rare ( Table 5.13 ). Success is more likely if: 
 •  the AF is paroxysmal 
 •  the left atrium is not very large 
 •  the patient is not obese 
 •  the patient does not drink much alcohol. 
 Th ere is controversy over whether stopping anticoagulation is safe for patients 
with apparently successful ablation. 
 7.  Protecting patients from embolic events is perhaps the most important aspect of the 
management of AF. Cerebral embolus is the most feared complication, but life-
threatening peripheral embolisation (e.g. to the mesenteric bed) can occur. Patients 
should have this aspect of AF explained to them early on. Th e risk of embolism is 
low in people under the age of 60 and without any risk factors:  < 0.5% a year. It 
can be as high as 30% for patients with mitral stenosis. Th e most recent advice has 
been to anticoagulate unless a patient seems at really low risk. 
 Use the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scoring (Birmingham 2009) system to help you decide 
whom to anticoagulate with AF: 
 CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scoring system 
 C ongestive heart failure (or LV systolic dysfunction): 1 point 
 H ypertension: 1 point 
 A ge 75 and over: 2 points

 8.  Patients with risk factors remain at risk of stroke even if sinus rhythm has been 
restored. Th ose with self-limiting paroxysmal AF are also at risk if episodes are more 
than a rare event. Antiplatelet drugs have no place in the current management of

AF. If anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated, some physicians will pragmatically 
prescribe antiplatelet therapy (e.g. aspirin and clopidogrel) but any benefi t is not 
evidence based. 
 9.  Novel (non-vitamin-K antagonist) oral antithrombotic agents (NOACs) are the treat-
ment of choice for these patients. Th ey are at least as safe and eff ective as warfarin. 
Th ey include: dabigatran, an oral antithrombin drug, and apixaban and rivaroxaban, 
which are activated factor X antagonists. Th e drugs are eff ective within a few hours 
of the fi rst dose. Th e doses need to be reduced if renal function is impaired and the 
drugs are contraindicated for patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (CrCl 
 < 30 mL / min). Th e current recommended dose regimens are shown in  Table 5.14 . 
In the United States and in some Australian renal units the drugs are being used 
for patients with very poor renal function and for dialysis patients. Gastrointestinal 
side-eff ects are common. Th e drugs cannot be monitored. Th ey are not indicated for 
valvular AF (this means mitral stenosis or any type of mechanical valve replacement, 
but not other valve abnormalities). Dabigitran can be reversed and dialysed. 
 10.  If warfarin is to be used, an assessment of the patient ’ s ability to manage regular 
blood tests and dosage adjustments is necessary before treatment can begin. Patients 
are often reluctant to undertake the complexities of treatment but should be advised 
against declining therapy until all the risks of this approach versus alternatives have 
been carefully explained. Th e availability of home international normalised ratio (INR) 
testing machines that use a capillary blood sample has made the use of warfarin more 
acceptable to some patients (e.g. those who travel frequently). A number of studies 
have shown that this approach is safe for selected patients. Th e safe therapeutic 
range is an INR of between 2 and 2.5. Find out from the patient how the warfarin 
is managed and whether he or she knows the last few readings and dosage. Patients 
should be encouraged to keep a record of their INR results and warfarin doses. Th e 
examiners will expect considerable detail about the patient ’ s warfarin management. 
 Remember that episodes of AF, for example, on a Holter monitor or at pacemaker 
interrogation, must last longer than 30 seconds to be considered signifi cant. Trials are 
under way to determine the minimum length of an episode of AF that involves an 
embolic risk. It may be considerably longer than 30 seconds. 
 Th e management of patients who are anticoagulated and have an acute coronary 
syndrome is controversial (there are no defi nitive trials). Consider:
 1.  continuing warfarin or NOAC 
 2.  reducing heparin dose during intervention 
 3.  aspirin and clopidogrel or just clopidogrel (not ticagrelor) 
 4.  a modern drug-eluting stent 
 5.  discharge on clopidogrel and anticoagulant for 1–12 months, then anticoagulant 
alone. 
 Remember the aim is to balance bleeding and thrombotic risk.

 THE PROBLEM OF AF AND RENAL FAILURE 
 Dialysis and severe CKD patients (eGFR  < 30 mL / min) have both an increased thrombotic 
and an increased haemorrhagic risk. Th ere is no clear evidence that they benefi t from 
anticoagulation with warfarin. Th e decision should be individualised. For example, a 
young dialysis patient who has already had a stroke may benefi t from treatment whereas 
an older patient with diffi  cult-to-control hypertension and previous haemorrhagic problems 
may not. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How does  this patient manage his or her warfarin treatment? Would you recommend 
changes? 
 2.  Is  this patient a candidate for a NOAC? 
 3.  How would you advise  this patient with CKD and AF with regard to anticoagulation?

 •  symptoms of right heart failure – a late event. 
 2.  Ask about recent precipitating causes of admissions to hospital (e.g. infection, 
haemoptysis). 
 3.  Enquire about treatment – physiotherapy, postural drainage, antibiotics (as prophylaxis 
or treatment), bronchodilators, lung resection. 
 4.  Determine whether the patient had childhood immunisations (e.g. MMR). 
 5.  Ask about investigations in the past (e.g. CT scanning, ciliary function studies, sweat 
test). 
 6.  Establish aetiology, such as childhood or early adult infections (e.g. pneumonia, 
measles, whooping cough) ( Table 6.2 ). Th e majority of cases have no obvious cause 
if those due to cystic fi brosis are excluded. 
 7.  Ask how the disease interferes with the patient ’ s life (e.g. work). Infertility is usual 
in men with primary ciliary dyskinesia and is variable in aff ected women. 
 The examination 
 Examine the respiratory system carefully (see  Table 16.10 ,  p. 446 ).
 1.  Particularly note the unpleasant purulent sputum. 
 2.  Examine carefully for clubbing, the yellow nail syndrome and localised crackles and 
wheezes. 
 3.  Look for the position of the apex beat (don ’ t miss dextrocardia – Kartagener ’ s syndrome) 
and for the signs of right heart failure. 
 4.  Consider the complications and look for them. Th ese include:
 a.  pneumonia 
 b.  pleurisy 
 c.  empyema 
 d.  lung abscess 
 e.  cor pulmonale 
 f.  cerebral abscess (very rare) 
 g.  amyloid (rare, but an important topic in the examination). 
 Investigations 
 Investigations should include:
 •  chest X-ray fi lm ( Fig. 6.1a ) – which may be normal, or it may show 1–2 cm cystic 
lesions or, more often, streaky infi ltration and thickened bronchial walls (tram tracking), 
especially in the lower lobes

 •  ventilatory function tests – which may show a restrictive defect or an obstructive 
pattern. Th ey are therefore more useful in assessing severity than in making the 
diagnosis. A patient with bronchiectasis with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV 1 ) of  < 40% predicted is said to have severe disease 
 •  arterial blood gas estimations – which may show mild or moderate hypoxia and, 
later, respiratory failure – defi ned as an arterial oxygen tension ( Pa O 2 )  < 60 mmHg 
or an arterial carbon dioxide tension ( Pa CO 2 )  > 50 mmHg 
 •  high-resolution CT scanning (HRCT) of the chest ( Fig. 6.1b ) – which is indicated 
in most patients to confi rm the diagnosis. Th e typical fi ndings are of airway dilatation 
(usually defi ned as a diameter greater than that of the accompanying branch of the 
pulmonary artery). Temporary dilatation can occur during acute infections so the 
scan should be performed when the patient is stable. Remember, the radiation dose 
of an HRCT is about 8 mSv and the test should be used sparingly, especially in 
children and young adults. 
 Th e disease is usually generalised but if the scan shows it to be localised then 
resection may be indicated as long as the underlying cause is not systemic. 
 Treatment 
 Th e principles of treatment are as follows.
 1.  Th e facilitation (or maximisation) of clearance of sputum and the treatment of 
infection with antibiotics and of bronchoconstriction with bronchodilators. 
 2.  Inhaled steroids may be of value if there is bronchial reactivity. 
 3.  Twice-daily postural drainage (20 minutes morning and night) or newer physiotherapy 
techniques should be recommended (e.g. use of a fl utter valve). Head-down drainage 
is now discouraged because of the risk of aspiration. 
 4.  Th e use of antibiotics during exacerbations is routine, though of unproven benefi t, 
and prednisone in tapered doses may be useful. Th e use of prophylactic nebulised 
antibiotics is a controversial treatment. Problem pathogens include  Mycobacterium

avium complex (MAC),  Pseudomonas and  Aspergillus . Patients with frequent infections 
may benefi t from long-term antibiotic treatment with macrolides. Recombinant 
deoxyribonuclease is useful for cystic fi brosis patients, but may be harmful for other 
patients with bronchiectasis. 
 5.  Infl uenza and pneumococcal vaccines are advisable for all patients. 
 6.  Treatment of heart failure should go  pari passu with that of the lung disease. 
 7.  Immunoglobulin defi ciency can be treated with monthly IV injections of immuno-
globulin, which decrease the incidence of infection and the need for hospitalisation. 
 8.  Massive haemoptysis may occur as a result of bronchial wall erosion and the increased 
vascularity of the bronchial walls. It may respond to bronchial artery embolisation. 
 9.  Smoking cessation (including of marijuana) is always essential. 
 10.  Home oxygen is of unproven benefi t but is often prescribed (to non-smoking patients) 
in severe disease (FEV 1  < 40%). A screening test for eligibility is oxygen saturation 
of 93% or less on room air. 
 11.  Surgery should be considered for localised disease to prevent progression, or as 
treatment of intractable haemorrhage. 
 12.  Transplant is occasionally appropriate for end-stage disease. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How satisfactory do you think  this patient ’ s physiotherapy management has been? 
 2.  Has  this patient an effective plan to manage exacerbations of his or her disease at 
home? 
 3.  How realistic is  this patient ’ s idea of the prognosis of the disease? 
 4.  How much was  this patient ’ s childhood – education, sport and social activity – affected 
by the disease?

 Lung carcinoma 
 Lung carcinoma is a common disease that candidates often encounter in the examination. 
It can pose a diagnostic and management problem, and remains a leading cause of 
cancer death in men and women. At diagnosis only 20% of patients will have local 
disease and half will have disseminated disease. Th e overall 5-year survival rate is less 
than 15%. Th e major cell types are set out in  Table 6.3 . Over the past 25 years, adeno-
carcinoma has become more common than squamous cell carcinoma. 
 
 
103
6 • The respiratory long case
 The history 
 1.  Find out how the diagnosis was made or suspected – a proportion of patients are 
asymptomatic and were diagnosed after a routine chest X-ray or scan. Th e most 
common early symptom is cough or change in the character of a smoker ’ s cough. 
 2.  Ask about the duration of illness and respiratory symptoms (e.g. haemoptysis, dyspnoea, 
increasing cough, chest pain), which may be very recent with a rapid growing tumour 
(e.g. small cell carcinoma). Dyspnoea may be due to associated COPD or to a pleural 
eff usion, infection or bronchial obstruction. Pleural infi ltration can cause chest pain. 
 3.  Enquire about a history of unresolved pneumonia (a common reason for investigations 
to exclude carcinoma of the lung), pleural eff usion or lung abscess. 
 4.  Ask about systemic symptoms (e.g. weight loss, loss of appetite, lethargy). 
 5.  Determine metastatic and non-metastatic symptoms ( Table 6.4 ). 
 6.  Ask about aetiology:
 a.  smoking and exposure to the cigarette smoke of others (a dose–response relationship 
– long-term smokers have a 10- to 30-fold risk; discontinuation of smoking reduces 
the risk over 10–15 years, but the relative risk does not return to 1.0); women have 
a higher risk for a given level of exposure to cigarette smoke than men (1.5 : 1) 
 b.  genetics – there is a familial association, and  EGFR and  ALK mutations in 
adenocarcinoma 
 c.  occupational history (e.g. asbestos exposure, uranium miners); remember, the 
eff ect of asbestos plus smoking is synergistic,  not additive: smoking and exposure 
to asbestos combined increase the risk 90-fold. Smoking, however, does not increase 
the risk of mesothelioma 
 d.  chronic scarring (e.g. tuberculosis, scleroderma, interstitial lung disease (ILD)) 
may be associated with adenocarcinoma. 
 7.  Ask about investigations performed, such as chest X-ray changes (the only abnormal 
fi nding in 5% of cases), CT scans, bronchoscopy, sputum cytology, needle biopsy 
and thoracotomy. PET / CT scanning is used to assess for metastatic disease. It has 
been shown to detect metastases in up to 20% of patients previously thought suitable 
for surgery. Th e fi nding of a solitary nodule on a chest X-ray must be investigated, 
but benign causes include a post-infection granuloma or a hamartoma. 
 8.  Enquire about the patient ’ s work and home environments, including the number 
of dependants and the patient ’ s ability to work. 
 9.  Ask about treatment off ered and begun. 
 10.  Find out the patient ’ s understanding of the condition and the likely prognosis. 
 The examination 
 1.  Finger clubbing is a most important sign (see  Table 16.11 ,  p. 447 ). Th is is very rare 
in small cell carcinoma. 
 2.  Chest signs will vary – listen carefully for a fi xed inspiratory wheeze over a large 
bronchus – sign of bronchial obstruction by tumour. 
 3.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy may have caused hoarseness, and phrenic nerve paralysis 
may have caused an elevation of a hemidiaphragm. 
 4.  An apical tumour may be responsible for Pancoast ’ s syndrome (C8, T1 thoracic nerve 
destruction or compression, or Horner ’ s syndrome, or both). 
 5.  SVC obstruction can occur owing to central tumours (e.g. squamous cell, small cell). 
Test for Pemberton sign (facial congestion and cyanosis if patient elevates both arms). 
 6.  Look for metastatic (e.g. supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly) and 
non-metastatic manifestations, especially the neurological and endocrinological changes 
(see  Table 6.4 ).

 2.  Th e chest X-ray or CT may suggest the cell type: for example, peripheral nodule 
adenocarcinoma; central lesion with obstructive pneumonitis – squamous; mediastinal 
or hilar mass – small cell; or alveolar infi ltrate – bronchoalveolar cell. Cavitation can 
occur, but not in small cell lung cancer. 
 3.  A suspect shadow on the chest X-ray fi lm should be investigated by fi breoptic bron-
choscopy and biopsy or fi ne-needle aspiration ( Fig. 6.2a and b). Bronchial brushings 
and washings, taken at bronchoscopy, should also be sent for cytological examination 
but have a lower yield than biopsy. 
 4.  For peripheral lesions, especially those less than 2 cm in size, transthoracic fi ne-needle 
biopsy with CT guidance is very useful, but complications (e.g. pneumothorax, 
signifi cant bleeding) can occur. 
 5.  In patients with a malignant pleural eff usion, thoracocentesis and pleural biopsy 
provide a high diagnostic yield (may need to be repeated if initially negative) (see 
 Table 16.12 ,  p. 449 ). 
 6.  Other investigations may include bone marrow biopsy, mediastinoscopy and thora-
cotomy. Endobronchial ultrasound guided biopsy (EBUS) has replaced surgical biopsy 
in many centres. 
 7.  Other possible causes (e.g. of a coin lesion) must be excluded. For this purpose, CT 
is helpful; demonstration of central or lamellar calcifi cation usually indicates that a 
coin lesion is benign. Follow-up scans to confi rm a lesion is unchanged are helpful. 
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be of value in cases when lesions 
are over 1 cm. 
 8.  Once the diagnosis is made and the cell type identifi ed, further investigations may 
be indicated to stage the disease.
 a.  Symptoms and signs that suggest central nervous system, liver, bone, chest wall 
or mediastinal involvement need to be sought carefully. 
 b.  Full blood count ( Table 6.5 ), serum calcium and liver function tests may suggest 
tumour spread. 
 c.  CT scanning of the chest and abdomen with contrast is an important aid in 
determining whether disease is localised. 
 d.  In small cell carcinoma, stage the disease into limited disease (lung primary, ipsilateral 
and contralateral hilar, mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes) or extensive disease 
– 70% of patients (contralateral lung, distant metastases). 
 e.  Non-small cell carcinoma is staged according to the tumour node metastases (TNM) 
international staging system ( Table 6.6 ). In general, disease confi ned to one 
hemithorax and the ipsilateral cervical nodes is called  limited and further involvement 
is described as  extensive disease. 
 9.  Assessment for resectability should include respiratory function tests. If the forced 
expiratory volume (FEV 1 ) is 1.5 L or more, this indicates that the patient could tolerate 
a pneumonectomy (a postoperative FEV 1 of 1 L or more is usually considered the 
minimum that will be tolerated). Otherwise, a patient who can climb three fl ights 
of stairs is usually considered well enough to tolerate surgery. 
 HINTS 
 •  The size of a lesion is the most important factor in determining the likelihood of 
malignancy. Nodules  < 8 mm in diameter have a 98% chance of being benign. Most 
lesions  > 2 cm are malignant. 
 •  A smooth border suggests a benign lesion; a spiculated border suggests malignancy.

 Treatment 
 Th e average 5-year survival rate for all types of carcinoma of the lung is about 15%. 
 SMALL CELL CARCINOMAS 
 1.  Th ese are only occasionally resected as they have usually metastasised at the time of 
diagnosis. Th ey are, however, sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Urgent 
therapy is needed if there is superior vena cava obstruction. 
 2.  In patients with limited disease, chemotherapy and concurrent radiotherapy improve 
the prognosis. Untreated, the median survival is only about 4 months. Treatment 
often includes platinum-based drugs – etoposide and cisplatin or carboplatin. 
 3.  Prophylactic cranial irradiation may be given to patients with complete responses. 
Th ere is a risk of leukaemia, central nervous system metastases, dementia and second 
primary malignancies with treatment. 
 Limited small cell carcinoma has a median survival with treatment of 11–18 months; 
10%–20% are disease free at 2 years. Extensive small cell carcinoma has a median 
survival of 6–12 months with therapy. 
 NON-SMALL CELL CARCINOMAS 
 1.  Th ese may be resectable – unless tumour has spread to the contralateral lung or 
outside the thorax, or there is signifi cant cardiopulmonary disease. 
 2.  Th e most important prognostic factor is the stage of disease. Staging usually involves 
bronchoscopy and CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and brain (PET scanning is 
useful but not covered by Medicare for this indication), as well as a physiological 
assessment of the patient ’ s fi tness for surgery, from the point of view of both lung 
function and general health. One-third of patients have disease suffi  ciently localised 
for an attempt at resection. 
 3.  Radiotherapy with ‘curative intent’ may be off ered to patients if they refuse surgery 
or are unfi t for surgery for other reasons. About 6% are alive after 5 years. Radiotherapy 
is not useful for patients who have had surgical resection of a peripheral tumour. 
 4.  Adjuvant chemotherapy is not routine for surgical patients, but regimens including 
cisplatin may provide a small survival advantage (5% at 5 years). A common regimen 
involves four cycles over 12–16 weeks. Median survival is only a few months in 
patients with intracranial metastases or bone involvement. 
 5.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are used for stage IV disease. Although these patients 
will succumb to the disease, there is evidence that this can prolong life and improve 
symptoms. Treatment is often guided by tumour characteristics – pemetrexed-based 
chemotherapy is preferred for non-squamous tumours. Some tumours have mutations 
at the tyrosine kinase domain, and the use of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefi tinib 
and erlotinib) has been associated with an initial improved response. Resistance usually 
develops after about a year of treatment. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Has there been adequate pain relief? 
 2.  How is the family coping? Does the patient plan to stay at home when things 
deteriorate? 
 3.  How would you decide to recommend to  this patient that palliative treatment is 
now preferable to further chemotherapy?

6 • The respiratory long case
 6.  Airway obstruction as a result of carcinoma may be relieved by using Nd-YAG laser 
or brachytherapy for palliation. 
 7.  Combination chemotherapy is sometimes appropriate (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine and cisplatin are commonly used). Survival benefi t is only 1 or 2 months. 
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
 Th is general term is usually applied to patients with persistent airfl ow limitation and a 
chronic infl ammatory response in the airways and lung parenchyma to inhaled noxious 
particles and gases. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are related diagnoses and, although 
these conditions are diff erent, they usually occur together. COPD is common and 
presents major management problems. However, in the examination it is unusual for 
it to be the patient ’ s only medical problem. Th e vast majority of patients with COPD 
(more than 95%) are or have been smokers. However, only about one-fi fth of smokers 
experience a rapid enough decline in FEV 1 ever to develop COPD. Th e FEV 1 / FVC 
(forced vital capacity) must usually be less than 70% for the diagnosis to be confi rmed. 
 The history 
 1.  Find out about symptoms, such as cough and sputum, dyspnoea, wheeze, impaired 
exercise tolerance, ankle oedema and weight loss. Remember that the diagnosis of 
chronic bronchitis is made largely from the history. 
 2.  Work out the Medical Research Council (MRC) score for severity of dyspnoea 
( Table 6.7 ). 
 3.  Ask about precipitating causes of disease exacerbation, such as an upper respiratory 
tract infection (this is most often viral), pneumonia, omission of drugs, symptoms 
of right ventricular failure, resumption of smoking, pneumothorax, sleep apnoea, 
oropharyngeal aspiration and gastro-oesophageal refl ux disease. 
 4.  Enquire about smoking habits. Ask about the number of cigarettes smoked per day 
and the length of use (10 packet years of smoking is usually a prerequisite), as well 
as exposure to other people ’ s cigarette smoke – passive smoking. Absence of a smoking 
history weighs heavily against the diagnosis unless chronic asthma or alpha 1 -antitrypsin 
defi ciency is present, or exposure to dust or fumes ( Box 6.1 ). Find out at what age 
the patient began to smoke. Commencement in adolescence when lung development 
is incomplete may lead to a more rapid decline in lung function.

 5.  Ask about occupational history. Th is may be important, particularly as an additive 
feature if the patient has pneumoconiosis or has been exposed to toluene in plastics 
factories. Exposure to the fumes of solid fuel fi res and to air pollution is also a risk 
factor. 
 6.  Ask about medications, especially steroids, home oxygen and bronchodilators. 
 7.  Enquire about management at home and work and the social eff ects of the disease. 
Find out in detail how limited the patient is physically and whether ADLs are managed. 
Ask about fi nancial problems associated with chronic illness and symptoms of depression 
caused by chronic disability and loss of self-esteem. 
 8.  Ask about admissions to hospital with exacerbations of the disease. Th ese are associated 
with a poor prognosis – over 8% 30-day mortality in some studies. 
 9.  Ask about family history, such as alpha 1 -antitrypsin defi ciency causing emphysema 
(autosomal co-dominant inheritance; the most common variant associated with severe 
defi ciency of alpha 1 -antitrypsin ( < 11 mmol / L) is the  ZZ allele, which is responsible 
for 2% of cases of emphysema in smokers). Th e condition should be suspected when 
COPD develops early or after minimal smoking exposure. 
 The examination 
 Examine the respiratory system carefully (see  Ch 16 ). Th e examination may be normal 
until airway obstruction is moderately severe. Look particularly for:
 1.  pursed-lip breathing (prolongs the expiratory time and may limit over-infl ation) 
and use of accessory muscles 
 2.  cyanosis and polycythaemia ( note: clubbing does not occur unless another disease 
such as carcinoma has supervened) 
 3.  intercostal recession 
 4.  prolonged forced expiratory time (reduced in both obstructive and restrictive lung 
disease) 
 5.  tracheal tug 
 6.  reduced diaphragmatic movements, over-infl ation, reduced chest wall movement 
and expansion; Hoover ’ s sign (paradoxical inward movement of the lower costal 
margin during inspiration) is sensitive and specifi c for COPD 
 7.  reduced breath sounds with or without wheezes (rhonchi) and early coarse inspiratory 
crackles 
 8.  sputum

 9.  signs of right heart failure 
 10.  signs of cachexia in patients with advanced disease (this is probably related to the

to the increased work of breathing) 
 11.  side-eff ects of treatment (e.g. tremor as a result of the use of beta-agonists, or the 
various changes caused by steroids). 
 Investigations 
 1.  Spirometry – by defi nition, spirometry will show airfl ow limitation and it can be 
used to grade severity ( Table 6.8 ). 
 2.  Chest X-ray fi lm ( Fig. 6.3 ) – look for signs of hyperinfl ation (fl at diaphragms and 
a vertical heart shadow) and cor pulmonale and exclude pneumonia. Radiolucent 
bullae may be visible; they are very specifi c for emphysema. Th e X-ray may be 
normal if the patient has mild disease. High-resolution CT of the chest is more 
often performed and is more specifi c for emphysema. Th e percentage of low attenuation 
areas on lung CT correlates with disease severity and may predict prognosis especially 
in patients with acute exacerbations. 
 3.  Ventilatory function tests – look for a considerable reduction of the FEV 1 / FVC 
ratio ( < 0.70). A normal FEV 1 excludes the condition. Th e amount of reversibility 
should be tested with bronchodilators. An increase in FEV 1 or FVC of more than 
15% and of at least 200 mL is considered signifi cant. Complete, or almost complete, 
reversibility means that the diagnosis is asthma rather than COPD. Some asthmatics 
smoke and have both conditions; many smokers claim to have asthma but have only 
COPD. Vital capacity or total lung capacity may be falsely decreased if measured 
by gas dilution techniques because of the non-homogeneity of ventilation in COPD. 
Th e diff using capacity for carbon monoxide is reduced in emphysema – a value of 
 < 50% is associated with exertion-induced hypoxia. 
 4.  Arterial blood gas levels – look for respiratory failure at rest. Th e demonstration 
of signifi cant hypoxia (usually a  Pa O 2 of  < 55 mmHg, or  < 59 mmHg if the patient 
has cor pulmonale) is required for the prescription of home oxygen treatment. 
Ventilatory failure is defi ned as  Pa CO 2 of  > 45 mmHg. 
 5.  Haemoglobin value – look for polycythaemia. 
 6.  Sputum culture – will usually grow  Haemophilus infl uenzae ,  Streptococcus pneumoniae 
or  Moraxella catarrhalis during exacerbations  and remissions. 
 7.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) – look for signs of right ventricular hypertrophy and 
multifocal atrial tachycardia, which can complicate chronic lung disease ( Figs 6.4 
and  6.5 ).

 b.  Inhaled long-acting anticholinergic drugs ( Table 6.9 ), such as tiotropium bromide, 
provide symptomatic improvement and reduce exacerbations, but do not prolong 
life. 
 c.  Inhaled steroids in high doses (e.g. 400  μ g beclomethasone) reduce the rate of 
episodes of exacerbation, but should be discontinued if after a trial of 4–8 weeks 
of treatment there is no clinical or spirometric improvement. 
 d.  Candidates should have a strategy to ensure eff ective use of the best device for a 
particular patient. Long-acting drugs, such as salmeterol, provide longer-acting 
bronchodilatation and are at least more convenient. Oral theophylline derivatives 
may have an additive eff ect with beta 2 -agonists, perhaps because they improve 
respiratory muscle function. Th ey are rarely used, however, partly because they 
cause oesophageal refl ux, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea and insomnia, and partly 
because they are not very eff ective. Antitussives and mucolytics are controversial, 
but may be useful to prevent exacerbations. 
 e.  When patients do not improve, consider problems with adherence or technique. 
 4.  Pursed lip breathing and postural changes may be of value. Maintain adequate 
hydration. 
 5.  Steroid use may be eff ective in an acute exacerbation and as a way of excluding 
asthma if there is persisting doubt. A trial of high doses for 2 weeks may be benefi cial 
when bronchodilators are insuffi  cient. 
 6.  Maintenance steroid treatment should be given only if a short course has been shown 
objectively to be eff ective (i.e. improved respiratory function test results). Use the 
lowest dose possible. Th e associated weight gain, loss of muscle strength and osteo-
porosis may make the patient worse. 
 7.  Annual infl uenza vaccine and 5-yearly pneumococcal vaccine are useful. Always 
know the immunisation status. 
 8.  Pulmonary rehabilitation programs have been demonstrated in randomised controlled 
trials to improve symptoms and quality of life, but not to prolong life. Exercise and 
weight reduction increase patients ’ wellbeing, but not their lung function. 
 9.  Domiciliary oxygen is indicated for patients with a  Pa O 2 of  < 55 mmHg ( Sa O 2  < 
88%) or cor pulmonale and a  Pa O 2 of  < 59 mmHg. Th ere is evidence that mortality 
rates are decreased by the use of domiciliary low-fl ow oxygen given for 15 hours 
per day or more (especially during sleep). Th is may work by reducing the progression 
of pulmonary hypertension. Find out what type of oxygen supplementation the 
patient uses (e.g. concentrator, cylinders) and how this is managed with regard to 
convenience and cost. Patients should not have home oxygen if they smoke. 
 10.  Consider treatment of cor pulmonale. Heart failure is likely to improve with successful 
treatment of the lung disease. Spironolactone and diuretics may be useful. Patients 
with pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD are not eligible for treatment 
with endothelin antagonists or sildenafi l. 
 11.  Alpha 1 -antitrypsin defi ciency can be treated by replenishing the missing antiprotease, 
which re-establishes antineutrophil elastase protection for the lower lung zones. An 
IV preparation can be administered weekly or monthly. Th is expensive treatment is

indicated only if alpha 1 -antitrypsin levels are below 11  μ mol / L. Only a small propor-
tion of people with alpha 1 -antitrypsin defi ciency develop COPD and the treatment 
is not recommended unless there is demonstrated disease. 
 12.  Lung transplantation is an option for younger ( < 65 years) patients with end-stage 
disease and without serious co-morbidity who have not had previous thoracic surgery 
and have stopped smoking. Th e 1-year survival rate is more than 80% for this group. 
 13.  Th e use of bi-level pressure ventilation (BiPAP) is a possible option for long-term 
management. 
 14.  Th e management of severe exacerbations is diffi  cult, particularly when these are 
associated with severe carbon dioxide retention and a reduced level of consciousness. 
Steroids and theophylline are both used commonly for these patients. Evidence for 
their eff ectiveness is not strong. Non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) via a mask may 
improve symptoms and avoid the need for intubation. Intensive care units (ICUs) 
usually require some evidence of a potentially reversible problem before allowing 
intubation and mechanical ventilation. Th e patient ’ s own wishes are important and 
should be obtained before he or she is too sick to make a decision. 
 15.  Patients with COPD or other chronic lung diseases may ask about air travel. Com-
mercial cabin pressures provide the equivalent of what would be 15% oxygen at sea 
level. If the patient ’ s  Sa O 2 is  < 95%, supplemental oxygen may be needed. An  Sa O 2 
of  < 88% is an indication for home oxygen and these patients should have their 
fl ow rate increased by 1 L / min when they fl y. Patients with an  Sa O 2 between 88 
and 95% should have an altitude simulation test before they fl y. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How would you help  this patient to stop smoking? 
 2.  How would you manage an acute exacerbation – at home or in hospital? 
 3.  When would home oxygen be appropriate for  this patient? 
 4.  Is  this patient a candidate for lung transplant? 
 Sleep apnoea 
 Sleep apnoea should be suspected in patients who have:
 •  obesity 
 •  hypertension 
 •  fatigue and daytime sleepiness 
 •  excessive snoring, or 
 •  unexplained respiratory failure. 
 Obstructive sleep apnoea is a common cause of sleep disturbance (aff ects 2% of 
woman and 4% of men aged 30–60), but by no means the only explanation for it. 
Sleep apnoea patients commonly have some combination of these symptoms. 
 The history 
 Classically, in obstructive sleep apnoea, anyone else in the house will describe a history 
of loud snoring at night, associated with multiple periods of cessation of respiratory 
movement and waking and gasping for breath. Apnoeas of more than 10 seconds are 
 
 
116
Examination Medicine
considered signifi cant, but for patients with this condition pauses of up to 2 or 3 minutes 
can occur and pauses of 30 seconds are common. Remember, though, that the majority 
of people who snore (40% of middle-aged men and 20% of middle-aged women) do 
not have sleep apnoea and brief apnoeas not associated with signs of arousal are normal 
for many people.
 1.  Ask the patient whether there have been problems with excessive daytime sleepiness 
and with working during the day. 
 2.  Enquire whether the patient drinks alcohol and, if so, how much. Alcohol consumption 
is a common exacerbating factor. 
 3.  Calculate the patient ’ s Epworth sleepiness score ( Table 6.10 ). 
 4.  Ask whether there is a history of hypertension and whether this has been treated 
(50% of these patients have hypertension). Find out whether the patient has had 
angina or arrhythmias at night; both of these may be precipitated by the hypoxia 
associated with apnoea. Heartburn and non-cardiac chest pain caused by gastro-
oesophageal refl ux are also common. 
 5.  Enquire about medications, such as hypnotics, that may have been prescribed for 
poor sleeping but actually aggravate sleep apnoea. 
 6.  Ask about a previous diagnosis of COPD or symptoms of heart failure. Th e recurrent 
increase in afterload that occurs during apnoeic episodes can precipitate or exacerbate 
left ventricular failure. Fewer than 10% of patients develop right heart failure and 
signifi cant pulmonary hypertension. 
 7.  Ask about a history of tonsillar enlargement or throat surgery. In a few sleep apnoea 
patients there is a clear anatomical cause for the obstruction. 
 8.  In the absence of excessive snoring, central sleep apnoea needs to be considered for 
a patient with the other symptoms. 
 9.  Ask about symptoms suggestive of narcolepsy rather than sleep apnoea ( Table 6.11 ). 
Th e sudden sleep attacks of narcolepsy can occur at any time, including during 
meals, conversation or driving. Patients may also report sudden loss of muscle tone 
from emotion (e.g. laughter). Th e result is an unexpected dropping of an object or 
a sudden buckling at the knees and falling down; cataplexy should be considered. 
Cataplexy is usually associated with narcolepsy, although it may precede narcolepsy 
by several years. 
 10.  Ask about symptoms of the restless legs syndrome (RLS), which may also lead to 
daytime sleepiness (remember, RLS is associated with iron defi ciency). 
 11.  Th e use of diuretics or insulin may predispose patients to inadequate sleep and 
should not be confused with sleep apnoea.

 12.  Ask whether the patient drives a motor car and whether the risks of driving have 
been discussed. Also ask whether it has been recommended that the anaesthetist be 
informed of the patient ’ s sleep apnoea before the administration of an anaesthetic. 
 13.  Find out whether a CPAP mask has been prescribed and whether the patient fi nds 
it comfortable enough to use. Up to 50% of patients are unable to tolerate the 
device. If the treatment is tolerated, fi nd out whether it has made a diff erence – many 
patients report a dramatic reduction in daytime sleepiness and improvement in 
wellbeing. 
 14.  Find out how this chronic condition has aff ected the patient ’ s family and work. 
 The examination 
 1.  Assess the BMI, but remember that up to 50% of patients with obstructive sleep 
apnoea and most patients with central sleep apnoea are not obese. 
 2.  Respiratory examination is usually normal. 
 3.  Measure the blood pressure and look in the fundi for signs of hypertension. 
 4.  Th e cardiovascular system should be examined carefully for evidence of pulmonary 
hypertension. 
 5.  Inspect the head, neck and mouth for signs of uvular enlargement and macroglossia 
or tonsillar hypertrophy – ‘pharyngeal crowding’. Look at and measure the neck 
circumference. 
 6.  Perform a neurological examination to look for signs of autonomic neuropathy (e.g. 
diabetes mellitus, Shy–Drager syndrome), brain stem lesions or spinal cord disease 
(e.g. tumour, demyelination), which can cause central sleep apnoea. 
 7.  Examine for neurological causes of obstructive sleep apnoea, such as myasthenia gravis 
or muscular dystrophy. 
 8.  Look for signs of hypothyroidism or acromegaly. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Consider sleep study monitoring (polysomnography) with the electroencephalogram, 
chin electromyogram, electro-ocular monitoring (to detect rapid eye movement (REM) 
sleep), oximetry,  Pa CO 2 monitoring and, if indicated, ECG monitoring (for 
arrhythmias). 
 2.  For a defi nitive diagnosis, the apnoeic spells must be 10 seconds or longer in duration 
and at least fi ve per hour must be recorded over several hours. Th e apnoea hypopnoea 
index (AHI) is the total number of episodes of apnoea or hypopnoea per night divided 
by the number of hours of sleep (mild 5–15, moderate 6–30, severe  > 30). A value 
of 5 or greater is considered abnormal, but is probably not diagnostic in the absence 
of symptoms. 
 3.  For patients with typical features of the condition, home  Pa O 2 monitoring overnight may 
be an option. A positive test (several signifi cant desaturation episodes per hour) is enough 
evidence to justify treatment. A negative test, however, does not exclude the diagnosis. 
 Table 6.11   Differential diagnosis of daytime sleepiness 
 1.  Not enough sleep (now sometimes considered related to ‘poor sleep hygiene’) 
 2.  Poor adjustment to shift work 
 3.  Use of sedative and stimulant drugs (e.g. sedatives, caffeine, narcotics) 
 4.  Depression with or without early morning waking 
 5.  Idiopathic hypersomnolence (sleepiness despite plenty of sleep without snoring) 
 6.  Narcolepsy (uncommon, sudden, unexpected falling asleep) 
 
 
118
Examination Medicine
 4.  Narcolepsy can also be diagnosed by a sleep study. 
 5.  Hypothyroidism should be excluded with thyroid function tests if there is any clinical 
suspicion. 
 6.  Check for proteinuria (uncommon, but may reach nephrotic levels in severe obesity). 
 7.  Look at the ECG for arrhythmias. Echocardiography may be indicated to enable 
estimation of pulmonary artery pressures and to assess right ventricular function. 
 Treatment 
 1.  If the patient has hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement may reverse sleep 
apnoea. 
 2.  Concomitant diseases such as cardiac failure, hypertension and asthma need to be 
treated vigorously. Nasal decongestants may be helpful. Weight loss is of value, but 
may be diffi  cult to achieve. Respiratory depressants, such as tranquillisers, should be 
withdrawn. 
 3.  CPAP is of value for long-term treatment of irreversible obstructive sleep apnoea 
( Table 6.12 ). CPAP devices are not always well tolerated, but the devices are improving 
steadily in comfort and portability. Nasal CPAP is eff ective in the majority of patients 
who can adjust to it. If there is residual sleepiness despite regular use of CPAP, 
modafi nil may be a useful adjunct. 
 4.  Surgical correction of upper airways narrowing caused by polyps, enlarged tonsils or 
macroglossia can lead to signifi cant improvement, but may not fully reverse the 
problem. Excision of soft tissue in the oropharynx is of value for well-selected patients. 
 5.  If there has been a recent stroke, observation may be all that is required, since respiratory 
function may improve with time. Patients with central sleep apnoea can often be 
successfully treated with bilevel positive airways pressure (BiPAP) ventilation.

treatment for sleep apnoea?

6 • The respiratory long case
 Interstitial lung disease, including idiopathic 
pulmonary ﬁ brosis 
 Interstitial lung disease (ILD) may have a prolonged course for some patients, so patients 
can be available for the examinations. Th e pathological pattern on lung biopsy is often 
used to classify these as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or non-specifi c-interstitial 
pneumonia (NSIP). Th e median survival time, however, is only 3–5 years. Discovering 
the aetiology may be diffi  cult (see  Tables 6.13 and  6.17 ). 
 The history 
 Th e diagnosis may not be obvious until you examine the patient, at which stage you 
may have to ask further questions about the following:
 1.  presenting respiratory symptoms (e.g. dry cough, dyspnoea, lethargy, malaise) 
 2.  whether the patient knows the cause of the respiratory symptoms 
 3.  the onset and duration of symptoms (these are clues) – pulmonary fi brosis has a 
very slow onset and patients are not acutely ill; if there is the insidious onset of 
cough, fever, malaise and myalgias over weeks to months, think about cryptogenic 
organising pneumonia (COP), which has a better prognosis and responds to steroids 
 4.  the patient ’ s gender and age (also clues) – for example, lymphangioleiomyomatosis 
(LAM) occurs essentially only in premenopausal women who often have a history 
of recurrent pneumothorax 
 5.  the smoking history – respiratory bronchiolitis ILD (RBILD), desquamative interstitial 
pneumonia (DIP) and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) have a strong 
association with smoking, presumably via a smoking-induced immune response; 
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF) are often smokers 1

Examination Medicine
 6.  systemic symptoms – for example, weight loss, fatigue, fever, rash and arthralgia, 
which may indicate a systemic disease, particularly a connective tissue disease 
(scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren ’ s syndrome or rheumatoid 
arthritis) or sarcoidosis ( Table 6.14 ) 
 7.  pre-existing asthma – which may suggest Churg–Strauss syndrome (ask about renal 
disease) 
 8.  any history of haemoptysis and renal disease – which may indicate Goodpasture ’ s 
syndrome or SLE 
 9.  drug use – cardiac (e.g. amiodarone ( Box 6.4 ), hydralazine, procainamide), rheu-
matological (e.g. methotrexate (see  Box 6.2 ),  D -penicillamine), chemotherapeutic 
(e.g. busulphan, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide) and others (e.g. nitrofurantoin (see 
 Box 6.3 ), bromocriptine) 
 10.  any history of radiotherapy 
 11.  a detailed lifetime occupational history, such as exposure to mineral dust (silicosis, 
asbestosis, coal worker ’ s pneumoconiosis), chemical fumes (nitrogen dioxide, chlorine, 
ammonia) or organic dusts ( Table 6.15 ) 
 12.  any occupational history consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (e.g. bird fancier ’ s 
lung, farmer ’ s lung from mouldy hay or grain dust in grain elevators); ask about 
recurrent Monday chest tightness (e.g. byssinosis from cotton, fl ax or hemp dust)

 Box 6.2   Methotrexate and the lungs 
 •  Fewer than 5% of patients using methotrexate are affected. 
 •  There is no correlation between the dose and the severity of the condition. 
 •  The condition may occur at any time from the start of treatment. 
 •  Patients present with fever, dyspnoea, cough and have diffuse pulmonary inﬁ ltrates. 
 •  In severe cases there can be dense pulmonary inﬁ ltration. 
 •  Mild eosinophilia is often present in the blood ﬁ lm. 
 •  The prognosis is good with withdrawal of the drug, but a course of steroids is often 
indicated. 
 
 
121
6 • The respiratory long case
 Box 6.4   Amiodarone and the lungs 
 •  Subacute pneumonitis (patchy ground-glass appearance on CT) 
 •  Pulmonary ﬁ brosis (reticulonodular pattern on CT) 
 •  Organising pneumonia (migrating alveolar opacities and nodules) 
 •  Diffuse alveolar damage (diffuse bilateral opacities that look like pulmonary oedema) 
 •  Alveolar haemorrhage (bilateral opacities – uncommon) 
 •  Subpleural masses (cause chest pain and pleural rub) 
 •  Subclinical pneumonitis (changes only on CT of ground-glass appearance) 
 Box 6.3   Nitrofurantoin and the lungs 
 •  Onset of symptoms may be acute or chronic. 
 •  Problems can occur within days of starting treatment or even after previous uneventful 
use of the drug. 
 •  Acute symptoms (20% of cases) include fever, chills, wheeze, myalgia, chest pain and 
rash. 
 •  Chronic symptoms occur independently of acute ones and occur months or years after 
treatment has begun. They include cough and dyspnoea. 
 •  CT scans and X-rays show reticular inﬁ ltrates, thickened peribronchial markings and 
later reduced lung volumes. 
 •  Treatment means stopping the drug; steroids are not useful for the acute form, but 
may be for the chronic symptoms.

 HEAVY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH: 
 1.  Asbestosis 
 2.  Bronchial carcinoma 
 TRIVIAL EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH: 
 1.  Pleural ﬁ brosis and plaques 
 2.  Mesothelioma after a latent period of 30–40 years 
 13.  infections (e.g. aspiration pneumonia, miliary tuberculosis) 
 14.  investigations (e.g. high-resolution CT of the thorax, lung biopsy or bronchial lavage) 
 15.  treatment, if any 
 16.  social problems as a result of the chronic disability. 
 The examination 
 1.  Clubbing (consider idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis, but also asbestosis); cyanosis and 
lower lobe crackles (fi ne, late, inspiratory) make the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary 
fi brosis (IPF) likely. 
 2.  If the signs suggest upper lobe pulmonary fi brosis, consider in your diff erential diagnosis 
silicosis, sarcoidosis, beryllium, cystic fi brosis, coal worker ’ s pneumoconiosis, eosinophilic 
granuloma, ankylosing spondylitis and tuberculosis. Lower lobe pulmonary fi brosis 
may be due to IPF, scleroderma, asbestosis, aspiration or drugs. 
 
 
122
Examination Medicine
 3.  Look for signs of associated systemic disease, as well as sarcoidosis and connective 
tissue disease that would rule out IPF. For example, erythema nodosum and anterior 
uveitis would suggest looking for evidence of sarcoidosis. 
 4.  Assess the severity of the disease (signs of pulmonary hypertension). 
 5.  Look for signs of drug side-eff ects (especially steroids). 
 Investigations 
 Th e goals of investigations are to fi nd the aetiology, establish the severity of the disease 
and look for signs of active infl ammation. If active infl ammation is present, the condition 
may respond to immunotherapy (steroids or cyclophosphamide). If established fi brosis 
is present, such treatment is unlikely to help.
 1.  Chest radiography is the initial investigation, but may be normal (see  Fig. 16.24 , 
 p. 453 ). 
 2.  High-resolution CT of the thorax is the investigation of choice ( Fig. 6.6 ). It is the 
most sensitive non-invasive test. Th e changes of ILD are characteristic. Note whether 
there is a localised or diff use abnormality or progressive massive fi brosis (caused by 
silicosis and coal worker ’ s pneumoconiosis). In two-thirds of patients with IPF, the 
CT scan may show the characteristic usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern – basal, 
subpleural reticular changes, honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. 
 3.  Cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP) is a common idiopathic interstitial 
pneumonia (IIP). Th e CT and X-ray show single or multifocal airspace opacities in 
patients who have presented with cough, fever and malaise.

more prominent on the right than on the left (arrows).

6 • The respiratory long case
 4.  Pulmonary function tests usually reveal a restrictive pattern, with reduction of lung 
volumes and reduced transfer factor. An obstructive pattern may be seen in sarcoidosis, 
histiocytosis X (typically found in men who smoke and have a history of pneumothorax) 
and LAM. 
 5.  Blood gas levels will show hypoxia with a normal or low  Pa CO 2 . 
 6.  Th e erythrocyte sedimentation rate is often raised. 
 7.  Th ere may be hypergammaglobulinaemia and a raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
level. Eosinophilia may be a useful clue ( Table 6.16 ). Serological testing for connective 
tissue diseases is routine. 
 8.  A positive gallium-67 lung scan may indicate disease activity. Lung clearance 
studies using pertechnate may also be helpful (rapid clearance suggests active 
alveolitis). 
 9.  Bronchoalveolar lavage can be performed and is most helpful if there is haemoptysis 
or an acute disease onset. It is suggested that fi brosis on a transbronchial biopsy 
associated with a lavage showing a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells is less 
responsive to treatment. Lymphocytosis on lavage suggests drug-induced or granu-
lomatous disease. 
 10.  Diagnoses likely to be made by transbronchial lung biopsy include sarcoidosis and 
lymphangitic spread of carcinoma; infection can be ruled out. Other specifi c diagnoses 
are not usually apparent. 
 11.  Open lung biopsy or video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy may be required to confi rm 
the presence of idiopathic ILD, but only if there is clinical uncertainty and the test 
result could change treatment. 
 Treatment 
 Th is depends on the cause ( Table 6.17 ). 
 1.  Remove exposure, if appropriate. Stop smoking – this can stabilise or improve lung 
function in patients with a smoking-related ILD. 
 2.  Treatment will not reverse established fi brosis. 
 3.  Steroids may help in COP, chemical injuries, hypersensitivity pneumonias (acute 
disease only), sarcoidosis (severe disease), histiocytosis X (controversial) and connective 
tissue disease. However, there is no evidence that steroids improve survival in these 
conditions and they are of no value in dust diseases. 
 4.  Treatment with prednisolone is usually begun at 1 mg / kg / day and reduced to 
half this dose after 4–12 weeks. Follow-up with measurement of spirometry, lung 
volumes and transfer factor is important to document response to treatment. 
Consider maintenance steroids in lower dosage for patients who are improving or 
stabilised. 
 Table 6.16   Causes of pulmonary inﬁ ltrate and eosinophilia (PIE) 
 P rolonged pulmonary eosinophilia. This may be caused by: drugs (e.g. sulfonamides, sulfasalazine, 
salicylates, nitrofurantoin, penicillin, isoniazid, methotrexate, carbamazepine, imipramine,  L -tryptophan); 
parasites (e.g.  Ascaris ); idiopathic
 L oefﬂ er ’ s syndrome (benign and acute)
 A llergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (always associated with asthma)
 T ropical (e.g. microﬁ laria)
 E osinophilic pneumonia and vasculitis (e.g. polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener ’ s granulomatosis)
 
 
124
Examination Medicine
 5.  Immunosuppressive agents are not eff ective for idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis but 
may be helpful in connective tissue disease-associated fi brosis, especially azathioprine, 
which can be used in combination with low-dose steroids. Antifi brotic agents are 
now available – pirfenidone and nintedanib (a tyrokinase inhibitor) reduce the 
decline in lung function. Pirfenidone causes skin sensitivity to sunlight and nintedanib 
causes diarrhoea. 
 6.  Treat any associated gastro-oesophageal refl ux as it may aggravate disease. 
 7.  Consider general measures, e.g. administering pneumococcal and infl uenza vaccines. 
 8.  Home oxygen therapy may provide symptomatic relief for hypoxaemic patients. 
 9.  Unilateral lung transplantation may be considered for some patients in the fi nal 
stage of their disease. Th is is potentially curative treatment. Younger patients with 
declining FVC and diff usion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) measurements 
should be considered for transplant. 
 10.  Treat any co-morbidities ( Table 6.18 ).

6 • The respiratory long case
 Pulmonary hypertension 
 Many patients with this chronic and often severe illness will have raised pulmonary artery 
pressures as a result of a cardiac or respiratory illness. Th e patient may or may not be 
aware of this complication of the underlying disease, but it is essential for the candidate 
to know when to look for it. Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPH) is a rare but 
important condition, which is diagnosed when other causes of pulmonary hypertension 
have been excluded. By defi nition, pulmonary hypertension is present when the mean 
pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) exceeds 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during exercise. 
 Pre-capillary PH means a mean PAP of  > 25 mmHg and a pulmonary capillary 
wedge pressure (PCWP) of  < 15 mmHg.  Post-capillary PH means a mean PAP  > 
25 mmHg and a PCWP of  > 15 mmHg. Post-capillary PH is usually due to left heart 
failure or disease (e.g. mitral stenosis). 
 Th e classifi cation of pulmonary hypertension was revised in 2008 and 2013. Th e Venice 
classifi cation is now called the Dana Point classifi cation. Th e term ‘primary pulmonary 
hypertension’ has been replaced with ‘idiopathic pulmonary hypertension’ ( Table 6.19 ). 
 The history 
 1.  Symptoms are usually non-specifi c but often severe. As usual, begin by asking whether 
the patient knows what is wrong and the reason for the admission, or visit, to hospital. 
 2.  If pulmonary hypertension seems a possibility, ask about the possible causes (see  Table 
6.19 ). Remember to ask specifi cally about appetite-suppressing drugs. Th e use of 
fenfl uramine and phentermine in combination and for long periods has been associated 
with the greatest risk. 
 Table 6.18   Common co-morbidities in ILD patients and management 
 1.  Gastroesophageal reﬂ ux
 • 
 Lung injury and increased ﬁ brosis – proton pump inhibitor, assess for scleroderma 
 2.  Infections
 • 
 Worsen lung function – vaccinations against inﬂ uenza and pneumococcus, antibiotics early 
 3.  Osteoporosis
 • 
 Rib and vertebral fractures can worsen breathing – vitamin D, etc. 
 4.  Sleep apnoea
 • 
 May make pulmonary hypertension worse – oxygen therapy, CPAP mask 
 5.  Pulmonary hypertension
 • 
 Increases mortality – oxygen therapy, vasodilators, endothelin antagonists 
 CPAP  = continuous positive airways pressure; ILD  = interstitial lung disease. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Do you think  this patient ’ s disease is active? 
 2.  What lung function assessment would you make for  this patient? 
 3.  Is home oxygen indicated? 
 4.  How would you assess  this patient ’ s prognosis? 
 5.  Is lung transplant worth considering for  this patient?

6 • The respiratory long case
 3.  If the patient has an illness that could be a cause, ask detailed questions about that 
condition, its severity and chronicity. Th ere may be a family history in cases of IPH 
(6%; autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance, 20%–80%). Th e 
majority of familial cases are associated with a mutation on the  BMPR2 gene. 
 4.  Find out how symptomatic the patient is now. Idiopathic and secondary pulmonary 
hypertension cause dyspnoea. Almost all patients have dyspnoea at the time of diagnosis. 
Other less common symptoms include fatigue, chest pain, syncope and oedema. Cough 
and haemoptysis can be present. Ask about symptoms of connective tissue diseases and 
especially about scleroderma. Try to work out the patient ’ s functional class (NYHA I–IV, 
often called the NYHA-WHO class when related to pulmonary hypertension). 
 5.  Ask about previous or planned investigations. Th ese may relate to the underlying 
condition – for example, respiratory function tests or scans, echocardiography (sometimes 
transoesophageal echocardiography) or cardiac catheterisation. A patient who presents 
with symptoms and signs of pulmonary hypertension needs a number of investigations 
before IPH can be diagnosed. 
 6.  What general treatment has been recommended? Th is may be for the underlying 
cardiac or respiratory condition or for thrombosis. Th ere may be a history of cardiac 
surgery in childhood for congenital heart disease. Oxygen supplementation is often 
prescribed. Find out how this is administered (e.g. via nasal prongs or a mask), for 
how many hours a day and whether it comes from a concentrator or oxygen tanks. 
Oxygen is very expensive unless subsidised. Ask about the cost and inconvenience of 
the treatment with regard to portability and noise (oxygen concentrators are noisy 
and use a lot of electricity). Has the treatment been helpful? 
 7.  What drugs is the patient taking? Heparin and then warfarin are routine for pulmonary 
embolism, but warfarin is also used for some patients with IPH because of the risk 
of in situ thrombosis in the pulmonary arteries. Bronchodilators and steroids may 
have been prescribed for lung disease. Th e possibility of a heart or lung transplant, 
or both, may have been raised with the patient. Th e patient may be on a therapeutic 
trial or taking an agent, such as bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan, sildenafi l or the 
inhaled prostacyclin analogue iloprost. Patients involved in trials or taking new drugs 
are often very well informed about what is going on. 
 8.  As with any chronic and possibly debilitating condition, questions about the patient ’ s ability 
to work and manage the activities of daily living need to be detailed and comprehensive. 
 The examination 
 1.  Try to assess the severity of the patient ’ s dyspnoea as he or she undresses or by asking 
the patient to walk around the room. 
 2.  Perform a thorough respiratory and cardiac examination (see  Table 16.1 ,  p. 413 and 
 Table 16.10 ,  p. 446 ). Look particularly for an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) 
with a large v wave. Feel for a parasternal impulse (right ventricular heave). Feel for 
a palpable P2 (and listen for tricuspid regurgitation). 
 3.  Look for signs of chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease and connective tissue 
disease. Examine for signs of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). 
 Investigations 
 Investigations are directed at fi nding an underlying reason for pulmonary hypertension 
– IPH is a diagnosis of exclusion – and at assessing its severity and potential reversibility. 
Th ese investigations include those detailed below.
 1.  Chest X-ray – this will be abnormal in 90% of IPH patients. It may show ILD or 
an abnormal cardiac silhouette – right ventricular dilatation. Th ere may be large

proximal pulmonary arteries that appear ‘pruned’ in the periphery, and the right 
ventricle may appear enlarged on the lateral fi lm ( Fig. 6.7a and b). 
 2.  Respiratory function tests (normal, restrictive or obstructive pattern) – moderate 
pulmonary hypertension itself is associated with a reduction in the diff usion capacity 
for carbon monoxide (DLCO) to about 50% of predicted. 
 3.  ECG – signs of right heart strain or hypertrophy are present in up to 90% of patients 
( Fig. 6.8 ). 
 4.  Blood gases – hypercapnia in hypoventilation syndromes, but hypocapnia is more 
common in IPH because of increased alveolar ventilation. Mild hypoxia is seen in 
IPH, but is more severe when pulmonary hypertension is secondary to lung disease. 
 5.  CT pulmonary angiogram or ventilation–perfusion (V / Q) scan and Doppler 
venograms – DVT and pulmonary embolism – assessment of extent of involvement 
of the pulmonary bed. 
 6.  High-resolution CT of the lungs – looking for interstitial lung disease. 
 7.  Six-minute walking test – predicts survival and correlates with NYHA-WHO class. 
Reduction in arterial oxygen concentration of  > 10% during this test predicts almost 
threefold mortality risk over 29 months. Patients unable to manage 332 metres in 6 
minutes also have an adverse prognosis. 
 8.  Transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiogram ( Fig. 6.9 ) – a transthoracic 
echocardiogram will usually enable left ventricular failure or severe mitral valve disease 
to be excluded. One or both will enable the assessment of known congenital heart

strain pattern, and sinus tachycardia.  
disease, the detection of a left-to-right (or reversed) shunting (Eisenmenger ’ s syndrome) 
and measurement, in many cases, of pulmonary artery pressures. Th e presence of 
tricuspid regurgitation (common in normal people and almost universal in the presence 
of raised right ventricular pressures) enables estimation of right ventricular and therefore 
pulmonary artery pressures in many patients. 
 Th e normal right ventricular and pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 20–25 mmHg. 
Assessment of pulmonary artery ejection characteristics can also be used to estimate 
pulmonary artery pressures. Right ventricular size and function can be assessed. Right 
ventricular dilatation and abnormal septal motion are useful signs of pulmonary 
hypertension. Th e right ventricle appears abnormal on echocardiograms in more than 
90% of people with pulmonary hypertension. 
 9.  Catheterisation of the right heart – this investigation is the gold standard and should 
also be performed if other tests have not been defi nitive. It is usually performed with a 
multiple-lumen fl otation catheter and enables direct measurement of the right heart pressures. 
Left to right shunting can be detected by the collection of blood samples from the venae 
cavae, right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery. A ‘step-up’ in the blood oxygen 
saturation indicates a shunt. Th e size of the shunt can be calculated if the cardiac output 
is measured by thermodilution. Measurement of the pulmonary artery wedge pressure 
enables the detection of mitral stenosis or the very rare pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. 
By defi nition, IPH means that the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is  < 18 mmHg (i.e. 
the raised pulmonary pressures are not secondary to left ventricular failure). Pulmonary 
vascular resistance can be calculated using the cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure 
and pulmonary artery wedge pressure measurements. Th e formula is: 
 pulmonary vascular resistance
pulmonary artery pressure
pu
=
−
lmonary artery wedge pressure
cardiac output
 
 Th is gives a result in mmHg / L / min or Wood units. Th e normal value is 1.7 mmHg / L / min.

6 • The respiratory long case
 Treatment 
 1.  Treatment of pulmonary hypertension that is secondary to an underlying respiratory 
or cardiac condition begins with an attempt to optimise treatment or fi x the underlying 
condition.
 a.  COPD: bronchodilators, steroids, continuous oxygen. 
 b.  ILD: oxygen. Aggressive treatment of an underlying connective tissue disease may 
halt or slow progression of the pulmonary pressures. 
 c.  Pulmonary embolus: anticoagulation, vena caval fi lter and occasionally pulmonary 
embolectomy. 
 d.  Mitral stenosis: valvotomy or replacement. 
 e.  Mitral regurgitation: repair or replacement if left ventricular function remains 
reasonable. 
 f.  Atrial septal defect: surgery or, if suitable, closure in the catheter laboratory (e.g. 
with an Amplatzer closure device). Th ere must be evidence of reversibility of the 
pulmonary pressure if it is close to systemic. 
 g.  Eisenmenger ’ s syndrome: repair of the defect responsible for the shunt is not usually 
possible once reversal of shunting has occurred. Consider heart and lung transplant 
if conservative treatment (diuretics, digoxin and sometimes ACEIs) has failed. 
 2.  General measures include continuous oxygen, diuretics, digoxin and spironolactone 
for problems with right heart failure. Use of the newer endothelin receptor antagonists 
(bosentan), prostaglandins (iloprost) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafi l) is 
generally indicated for IPH and pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective 
tissue disease and pulmonary embolism. Bosentan has also been approved for use in 
Eisenmenger ’ s syndrome. Riociguat (guanylate cyclase stimulator) is eff ective for 
pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary embolism. 
 IDIOPATHIC (PRIMARY) PULMONARY HYPERTENSION 
 Treatment of this progressive and debilitating condition involves the general measures 
outlined above. Untreated patients have a poor survival rate: 2–3 years median survival 
from the time of diagnosis.
 1.  Bosentan and ambrisentan have been approved for use for patients with IPH. Th ese 
drugs are endothelin receptor antagonists. Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor 
whose levels have been shown to be elevated in patients with IPH. Modest improve-
ments in functional capacity and pulmonary artery pressures have been demonstrated 
after treatment of patients with IPH and those with underlying connective tissue 
disease. Th e drug is available only for patients with class III symptoms and a right 
atrial pressure of  > 8 mmHg. Its side-eff ects include teratogenicity, an increase in 
liver enzyme levels and possibly male infertility. Prostacyclin analogues, such as iloprost, 
which are taken by inhalation, can also be eff ective. Continuous IV epoprostenol has 
been shown to improve symptoms and prognosis in a number of small randomised 
trials for IPH patients at least. Sildenafi l (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) is a vasodilator 
that must not be used in combination with nitrates because of the risk of severe and 
prolonged hypotension. 
 2.  Combination treatment may be indicated if there is failure to respond to a single 
drug but this, in Australia, must generally be as part of a clinical trial and supervised 
in a specialist unit. Some of the drug manufacturers will provide sildenafi l for patients 
already taking an endothelin antagonist. Th is means combination treatment is common 
but not subsidised by the PBS. 
 3.  Suitable patients (severe unresponsive disease, right heart failure, young patient) should 
be considered for transplant. Successful outcomes have been shown with heart–lung, 
 
 
132
Examination Medicine
double-lung or single-lung transplants. IPH has not been found to recur in the 
transplanted lung. Th e prognosis depends on the NYHA-WHO functional class: class 
I–II, 6 years; class III, 2.5 years; class IV, 6 months. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How would you decide whether  this patient qualiﬁ es for an endothelin antagonist? 
 2.  What alternative causes of  this patient ’ s dyspnoea would you consider? How would 
you investigate for them?

 Sarcoidosis 
 Th is chronic, systemic, granulomatous disease is relatively common and patients occasion-
ally require admission to hospital for investigation or treatment. It is an unusual lung 
disease in that it is less common in smokers. Although most patients present between 
the ages of 20 and 40 years, children and elderly people are sometimes aff ected. Th ere 
are cases of familial sarcoidosis. At presentation, 90% of patients have pulmonary 
involvement and 40% have other organs aff ected. Th e disorder results from an exaggerated 
T-helper lymphocyte response that occurs for unknown reasons and is responsible for 
granuloma formation and fi brosis. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask whether the patient has been admitted to hospital and, if so, why. Th e patient 
may already know the diagnosis and be an outpatient undergoing further investigations 
or treatment, or the diagnosis may be suspected because of lymphadenopathy or 
changes on chest X-ray ( Fig. 6.10 ). Most patients present with asymptomatic hilar 
adenopathy ( Table 6.20 ). 
 2.  Ask about acute or subacute symptoms, as sarcoidosis develops in this way in about 
one-third of cases. Th e patient may have fever, weight loss, loss of appetite and 
malaise. Th e occurrence of erythema nodosum, joint symptoms and bilateral hilar 
adenopathy on the chest X-ray suggests an acute presentation. A combination of 
fever, facial nerve palsy, parotid enlargement and anterior uveitis may occur. 
 3.  Symptoms suggesting a more insidious onset include persistent cough and dyspnoea. 
If the patient has chronic sarcoidosis, it is still important to fi nd out how he or she 
originally presented, as the insidious onset is more often associated with chronic 
sarcoidosis and the development of damage to the lungs (up to 15% develop progressive 
pulmonary fi brosis – ILD) and other organs. 
 
 
133
6 • The respiratory long case
 4.  Ask about skin eruptions (e.g. erythema nodosum, plaques, maculopapular lesions 
and subcutaneous nodules). Erythema nodosum, fever and migratory polyarthralgias, 
when found in combination with hilar lymphadenopathy, may indicate Lofgren ’ s 
syndrome. 
 5.  Eye symptoms occur in about one-quarter of patients. Th e patient may have noticed 
blurred vision, excess tears and light sensitivity due to uveitis. Involvement of the 
lacrimal glands can cause sicca syndrome, resulting in dry, sore eyes. 
 6.  Ask about nasal stuffi  ness, as the nasal mucosa is involved in about one-fi fth of 
patients. Occasionally, a hoarse voice or even stridor may result from sarcoid involving 
the larynx. 
 7.  Renal involvement is uncommon but occasionally nephrolithiasis can result because 
of hypercalcaemia. 
 8.  Ask about neurological symptoms – facial nerve palsy is the most common manifesta-
tion, but psychiatric disturbances and fi ts may occur. 
 9.  Almost half the patients at some time in the course of the disease have arthralgia; 
even frank arthritis can occur. 
 10.  Th e patient may be aware of cardiac abnormalities. Conduction problems, including 
complete heart block and ventricular arrhythmias, occur in about 5% of patients. 
Cardioverter-defi brillators are occasionally required. VT ablation treatment is diffi  cult 
because of the diff use nature of the cardiac involvement. 
 11.  If the patient is female, ask about pregnancies. Sarcoidosis tends to abate in pregnancy 
but then fl are up in the postpartum period.

Examination Medicine
 12.  Enquire about gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. dysphagia from hilar adenopathy), 
although these are very rare. Liver involvement is common but rarely causes symptoms. 
Th e patient may know about abnormal liver function tests (usually a cholestatic 
picture). 
 13.  Ask how the diagnosis was made. Th e CT scan has a characteristic appearance and 
may have been the only investigation performed, although in most cases the diagnosis 
is confi rmed by biopsy. Specifi cally determine whether a lymph node biopsy or lung 
biopsy has been performed. Sometimes a skin or conjunctival biopsy may have been 
obtained to make the diagnosis. Bronchial or transbronchial lung biopsies are used 
to make the diagnosis in most cases. Occasionally, mediastinoscopy with lymph 
node biopsy is needed to make the diagnosis. 
 14.  Ask about treatment. Find out whether the patient has been receiving steroids and 
what dose is currently being taken. Various other treatments may have been tried, 
including NSAIDs, cyclosporin and cyclophosphamide. 
 15.  Ask about the disease impact on the patient and his or her family. 
 The examination 
 1.  Begin with an examination of the skin.
 a.  You might be lucky enough to fi nd erythema nodosum. Th ese raised red or purple 
lesions are most commonly found on the lower limbs. Th ey resolve spontaneously 
after 3 or 4 weeks. 
 b.  Look at the face, back and extremities for maculopapular eruptions. Th ese are 
elevated spots less than 1 cm in diameter that have a waxy, fl at top. Th ere may 
also be lupus pernio on the face ( Fig. 6.11 ). Th ese are purple swollen nodules with

a shiny surface, which particularly aff ect the nose, cheeks, eyelids and ears. Th ey 
may make the nose appear bulbous; occasionally the mucosa of the nose may be 
involved and the underlying bone can be destroyed. Lupus pernio sometimes also 
involves the fi ngers and knees. Pink nodules may be found in old scars. 
 2.  Examine the eyes for signs of uveitis. Yellow conjunctival nodules may be present. 
Examine the fundi for papilloedema. Feel the parotids. Uveoparotid fever presents 
with uveitis, parotid swelling and seventh cranial nerve palsy. 
 3.  Next, examine the respiratory system. Most commonly, physical examination of the 
chest reveals no abnormality. Look particularly for signs of interstitial lung disease; 
basal end-inspiratory crackles may be present. Pleural eff usions occur rarely. 
 4.  Next, examine all the lymph nodes. Lymphadenopathy is sometimes generalised. 
 5.  Now examine the abdomen for hepatomegaly (20%) and splenomegaly (up to 40%). 
 6.  Examine the joints for signs of arthritis, which is almost always non-deforming. 
 7.  Examine the nervous system. Look particularly for facial nerve palsy. 
 8.  Feel the pulse (heart block or arrhythmia) and look for signs of right ventricular 
failure or cardiomyopathy. Note the presence of a pacemaker or defi brillator box. 
 Investigations 
 1.  A full blood count may reveal lymphocytopenia and sometimes eosinophilia. 
 2.  Th e ESR is often raised. Th ere may be hyperglobulinaemia. 
 3.  Th e ACE level is raised in about two-thirds of patients with active sarcoidosis but 
unfortunately is not diagnostic; ACE is also sometimes elevated (5%) in healthy 
persons or those with primary biliary cholangitis, leprosy, atypical mycobacterial 
infection, miliary tuberculosis, silicosis, acute histoplasmosis and hyperparathyroidism. 
ACE is not elevated in patients with malignancies (e.g. lymphoma). Hypercalcaemia 
and, more commonly, hypercalciuria may be present. 
 4.  Th e chest X-ray is usually abnormal ( Table 6.21 ) and the changes can be classifi ed 
into four stages:
 •  Stage 1 Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy alone 
 •  Stage 2 Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infi ltration 
 •  Stage 3 Pulmonary infi ltration without hilar lymphadenopathy 
 •  Stage 4 Pulmonary fi brosis. 
 Patients with stage 1 X-rays are considered to have an acute reversible form of 
the disease, whereas the other stages tend to be more chronic. Th e chest X-ray may 
show paratracheal lymphadenopathy; cavitation and pleural eff usions are rare. Cavities 
may become colonised with  Aspergillus . CT scans of the chest may show a ground-glass 
appearance when active alveolitis is present. Always think about excluding tuberculosis 
and histoplasmosis. 
 Table 6.21   Chest X-ray changes in sarcoidosis 
 1.  Hilar lymphadenopathy – up to 90% 
 2.  Paratracheal lymphadenopathy – less than 80% 
 3.  Reticulonodular changes – 70% 
 4.  Peripheral nodules – less than 5% 
 5.  Cavitation – less than 5% 
 6.  Pleural effusion – less than 5% 
 7.  Linear atelectasis – less than 1% 
 
 
136
Examination Medicine
 5.  If there is parenchymal granulomatous involvement, respiratory function tests reveal 
the changes that are typical of interstitial lung disease, with reduced lung volumes 
and diff using capacity, but a normal FEV 1 / FVC ratio. Occasionally, a mixed pattern 
of obstruction and restriction is seen. 
 6.  Blood gas estimations may show mild hypoxaemia. 
 7.  A gallium-67 lung scan usually shows a pattern of diff use uptake, but increased 
uptake in the lacrimal and parotid glands (panda sign) or in the right paratracheal 
and left hilar areas (lambda sign) is more specifi c for sarcoidosis. Enlarged nodes 
also tend to show up on the scans. 
 8.  Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy will usually establish the pathological 
diagnosis. Bronchioalveolar lavage will show an increase in the number of CD4  +  
T-helper lymphocytes. However, this is not diagnostic of the condition. 
 9.  Biopsy of lymph nodes, skin or liver may be diagnostic. Th e non-caseating granulomas 
found in sarcoidosis are non-specifi c; they are also found in berylliosis, leprosy, 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis and granulomatous infection, and in lymph nodes that 
drain adjacent carcinomas. 
 10.  If cardiac involvement is suspected then an MRI or PET scan is the best way of 
delineating the extent of cardiac involvement and the risk of signifi cant arrhythmias. 
 Treatment 
 Indications for treatment are lack of resolution of active pulmonary sarcoidosis with 
increasing symptoms or worsening lung function; neurological, renal or cardiac complica-
tions; major eye disease; and occasionally severe systemic symptoms (e.g. fever and 
weight loss).
 1.  Th e drug of choice is prednisolone. Th is is begun in high dose (1 mg / kg) for up to 
6 weeks and then tapered over the following few months. Treatment is continued for 
12 months. Th e prognosis is good. About 50% of patients develop some permanent 
organ damage but, in most, this is mild. 
 2.  Patients who require longer treatment may be off ered steroid-sparing drugs, including 
chlorambucil, methotrexate or azathioprine. 
 3.  Hydroxychloroquine may be useful for skin disease. 
 4.  Infl iximab (a monoclonal antibody directed at tumour necrosis factor (TNF)) has 
been shown to improve lung function for patients already being treated with steroids 
and cytotoxics. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Does  this patient have treatment for his or her sarcoidosis? 
 2.  What follow-up regimen – reviews and investigations – would you recommend for 
 this patient? 
 Cystic ﬁ brosis 
 Th e survival of children with cystic fi brosis (CF) into adult life is now common. Over 
50% of patients reach the age of 30 years and the prognosis is improving all the time. 
Although paediatricians are often reluctant to give up these patients, there are more 
surviving patients under adult physicians ’ care than with paediatricians. A small number 
of cases are diagnosed in adult life. 
 
 
137
6 • The respiratory long case
 Cystic fi brosis is a common, serious, congenital inherited defect in Caucasian people. 
It has an autosomal recessive inheritance and the gene has been identifi ed. Th e mutation 
is in the cystic fi brosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein gene on chromosome 
7. Th e mutation causes increased sodium and chloride excretion in sweat and increased 
resorption of sodium and water from respiratory mucosa. Th e trait is present in about 
1 in 25 Caucasians and 1 in 3000 has the condition. It is rare in other races. It is a 
chronic disease that can aff ect the lungs, pancreas, bowel, liver and sweat glands. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about presentation:
 a.  Age at diagnosis – 90% of patients are diagnosed at 4–6 weeks of age by screening 
tests. 
 b.  Presenting symptoms – the patient may have been told that he or she had meconium 
ileus as a baby or recurrent respiratory infections in early life; failure to thrive may 
suggest the diagnosis. Many patients, however, are asymptomatic at the time of 
diagnosis. 
 c.  Pulmonary symptoms – these include cough and sputum, haemoptysis, wheeze, 
dyspnoea. 
 d.  Nasal polyps and sinusitis – are relatively common. 
 e.  Gastrointestinal symptoms – include problems maintaining weight; diarrhoea and 
steatorrhoea (malabsorption secondary to pancreatic insuffi  ciency – 90% of patients); 
constipation, rectal prolapse, abdominal distension and bowel obstruction (defective 
water excretion into the bowel). 
 f.  Heat exhaustion in hot weather – patients with cystic fi brosis can lose large amounts 
of salt in their sweat, which sometimes causes problems, particularly in the tropics. 
 g.  Cardiac symptoms – the patient may know of cardiac involvement (cor pulmonale 
is a very late development). 
 h.  Jaundice and variceal bleeding – focal biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension 
occur occasionally. 
 i.  Diabetes mellitus – cystic-fi brosis-related diabetes is diff erent from typical type 1 
diabetes and occurs in up to 20% of 18-year-olds with CF and upwards of 50% 
of 30-year-olds. 
 2.  Ask about diagnosis. Th e patient may know whether a sweat test was performed. 
Collection of sweat and measurement of the chloride concentration is still the accepted 
method of diagnosing the condition. A sweat chloride concentration of more than 
70 mmol / L suggests cystic fi brosis in an adult. Otherwise, a combination of respiratory 
and malabsorptive problems may be considered enough to make the diagnosis. A list 
of the major and minor diagnostic criteria is presented in  Table 6.22 . DNA markers 
are likely to be used increasingly in the diagnosis. At the moment this is diffi  cult 
because there are a large number of abnormal genotypes (over 2000) that can result 
in the disease. Screening for the commonest mutations is the basis for the two-stage 
newborn screening testing conducted in all states. If two mutations are recognised 
the diagnosis is made, while if only one is found the child is referred back for sweat 
testing. 
 3.  Ask about family history – the autosomal recessive inheritance means siblings and 
other close relatives may be aff ected. 
 4.  Ask about treatment. Pulmonary disease is the main determinant of mortality. Aggressive 
treatment of the pulmonary complications has had the greatest eff ect on the improve-
ment in life expectancy. Th e patients are usually well aware of this and are largely 
responsible for their own treatment. Th e condition is a chronic suppurative progressive 
 
 
138
Examination Medicine
one causing bronchiolitis, bronchitis, pneumonia (uncommon in children) and 
eventually bronchiectasis. Th e pathology is probably the result of the formation of 
viscous mucous plugs, which lead to distal infection and lung damage.
 a.  Th e mainstay of treatment is physiotherapy, which the patient, with help from 
family and a physiotherapist, performs. Ask about deep breathing, percussion, 
postural drainage, the use of the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEP) techniques 
such as the PEP mask, and the forced expiratory technique called ‘huffi  ng’. 
 b.  Ask about inhaled therapies. Th is may include nebulised hypertonic saline, then 
inhaled DNAase (once daily). 
 c.  Th e patient should also know what antibiotics have been used and whether continu-
ously or intermittently. Nebulised bronchodilators and antibiotics are commonly 
prescribed.  Staphylococcus aureus and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa are common pathogens 
because of their ability to grow on the abnormal bronchial mucus of cystic fi brotic 
lungs. Th e patient may know if the  Pseudomonas is antibiotic resistant. Macrolide 
antibiotics, especially azithromycin, are being used because of their anti-infl ammatory 
properties. Ask whether he or she has had pneumococcal or infl uenza vaccination. 
 d.  Ask whether treatment for complications, such as haemoptysis, cor pulmonale or 
pneumothorax, has been required. Minor haemoptysis, where less than 250 mL 
of blood is lost, occurs in about 60% of patients. Major haemoptysis occurs in 
about 7% of patients and bronchial artery embolisation may be required. Cor 
pulmonale may require treatment with diuretics, spironolactone and possibly vasodila-
tors, but aggressive treatment of the lung disease and supplementary oxygen are 
more important in the long term. Pleurodesis used to be the treatment of choice 
for recurrent pneumothorax, but this may result in a contraindication to lung 
transplantation. 
 5.  Enquire about gastrointestinal symptoms. Th ese tend to be less of a problem, but 
malabsorption may make weight gain very diffi  cult for these patients. Ask what 
pancreatic enzyme replacement the patient uses and how often. Enzyme therapy is 
based on the fat content of each meal ingested. Enquire about food intolerances, 
adherence to enzymes and presence of abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain. 
 6.  Ask about the number of admissions to hospital over the past 12 months and the 
length of each stay. Routine admission to hospital three or four times a year for

intensive physiotherapy and intravenous antibiotics and bronchodilators (a tune-up) 
can be advantageous. 
 7.  Enquire about social support. Ask whether the patient knows about or belongs to 
the local cystic fi brosis association and whether he or she has been in touch with 
other aff ected patients. However, patients in direct contact with other patients with 
CF increase the risk of cross-infection. It is recommended that no patient with CF 
comes in contact with another CF patient. 
 8.  Try to fi nd out tactfully whether the patient understands the inheritance of the disease; 
male patients may know that azoospermia is usually present owing to destruction of 
the vas deferens by abnormal secretions (95%). Sperm aspiration and in vitro fertilisation 
are possible. Eighty per cent of women are fertile, and pregnancy and breastfeeding 
are often successful. Find out in some detail how a young adult copes with this 
debilitating and life-shortening disease. 
 The examination 
 1.  Looking at the patient ’ s chest shape is benefi cial, and at overall nutritional status – 
malnourished patients often have a protuberant abdomen. Muscle bulk is considered 
a good indicator of the severity and prognosis in a particular patient. Measure the 
patient ’ s height and weight. 
 2.  Ask the patient to cough. Listen for a loose cough and examine any sputum for the 
degree of purulence. 
 3.  Now examine the respiratory system carefully. Note clubbing, which is present in the 
majority of patients. Look for abnormal chest wall development. Look for signs of 
past treatment for pneumothorax or transplant (scars). 
 4.  Estimate forced expiratory time and examine the chest, listening particularly for 
crackles, wheezes and reduced breath sounds. 
 5.  Examine the heart for signs of cor pulmonale and right ventricular failure. 
 6.  Examine the abdomen for signs of faecal loading, especially in the right iliac fossa, 
organomegaly, such as hepatomegaly, or hard liver edge, as in cirrhosis, splenomegaly 
and other signs of portal hypertension as well as sites of insulin injections in the 
abdominal wall, also scars of previous surgery including those for meconium ileus at 
birth. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Sputum culture: colonisation with  H. infl uenzae and  S. aureus tends to occur in young 
patients and this is sometimes followed by nosocomial  E. coli and  Proteus spp. By 
the age of 10 years,  Pseudomonas is the main pathogen in most patients, but usually 
it does not cause systemic infection. 
 2.  A full blood count: to look for anaemia, which may be caused by malabsorption or 
chronic disease; the white cell count may indicate acute infection. Polycythaemia is 
rare, despite chronic hypoxia. 
 3.  Th e electrolyte levels and liver function tests: there may be evidence of defi ciencies 
of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). Th e creatinine level should be known before 
aminoglycosides are used. 
 4.  Th e chest X-ray ( Fig. 6.12a and b): should be compared with previous fi lms if these 
are available. Increased lung markings are present in 98% of patients. Th ese occur 
particularly in the upper lobes. Cystic bronchiectatic changes occur in more than 
60% of patients. Mucous plugs may be seen in one-third and atelectasis occurs in 
just over 10% of patients. Look also for pneumothorax and pleural changes at the 
site of previous pneumothoraces or pleurodesis.

 5.  Chest CT is not routine, but may help defi ne focal areas of bronchiectasis that are 
occasionally amenable to resection. 
 6.  Spirometry readings may fl uctuate because of airway infl ammation. An FEV 1 that is 
persistently less than 40% indicates a poor prognosis. 
 Management 
 Try to form an idea of the patient ’ s ability to cope with the illness, as so much of the 
management depends on this.
 1.  Intensive and repetitive physiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Inactivated infl uenza 
vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine should be routine. 
 2.  Intravenous antibiotics may be indicated for acute exacerbations of pulmonary disease 
if these are severe or fail to respond to oral antibiotic treatment. In most cases, dual 
IV antibiotics including one of the aminoglycosides and a semisynthetic penicillin 
are used. 
 3.  Nebulised and dry-powder tobramycin are both approved after extensive trials as 
being benefi cial in treating  Pseudomonas lung disease in CF. Nebulised anti- Pseudomonas 
antibiotics improve lung function and prognosis. 
 4.  Malabsorption may require aggressive treatment with pancreatic enzyme supplements, 
including lipase, and frequent small meals as well as vitamin supplements. 
 5.  Double-lung transplantation is now an accepted, although still uncommon, treatment 
in patients with advanced disease. Cystic fi brosis does not recur in the transplanted 
lung. Th e 5-year survival rate is only about 65%. 
 6.  Human recombinant DNAase seems eff ective in degrading the concentration of DNA 
in sputum, reducing sputum viscosity and improving the patient ’ s ability to clear 
pulmonary secretions. DNAase has been proven to be eff ective both in those with 
established CF lung disease and in preventing decline in lung function when com-
menced in patients who have well-preserved lung function. 
 7.  Small molecules are able to correct the CF conductance regulator. Ivacaftor is an oral 
treatment for patients with the G55 1D mutation. For those with the F508 deletion, 
elexacaftor and tezacaftor are added (triple therapy).

6 • The respiratory long case
 Tuberculosis 
 Th e increased incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) over the past 10 years or so 
and its association with HIV infection have made it a possible long case. Protection 
from  Mycobacterium tuberculosis is via cell-mediated immunity involving CD4  +  T-helper 
lymphocytes. Th e defects of these cells in number and eff ectiveness, which is characteristic 
of HIV infection, explain this susceptibility. It may be a diffi  cult diagnostic or management 
problem, or both. It also has important social and public health implications. 
 The history 
 Th e patient is likely to know that the diagnosis has been made or is suspected.
 1.  Find out whether the patient is a recent immigrant and, if so, from where. 
 2.  Ask whether there has been a previous diagnosis of any other serious medical problem 
that might interfere with cell-mediated immunity, such as malnutrition, alcoholism 
or HIV infection. 
 3.  Establish how the diagnosis was made and how long ago. 
 4.  Ask about some of the important symptoms – weight loss, sweats and fever, cough 
with purulent and blood-stained sputum, and pleuritic chest pain from pleural lesions 
or uncontrolled coughing. 
 5.  Ask what investigations have been performed or are planned. TB may have been 
suspected after a chest X-ray was performed because of respiratory symptoms or as 
a routine screening test. Th e patient may remember having to give early morning 
sputum specimens on a number of occasions or having had a bronchocospy with 
washings, if sputum was not being produced. Bronchoscopy may have been performed 
to exclude other causes of an abnormal chest X-ray, such as carcinoma of the lung. 
 A tuberculin (Mantoux) skin test may have been performed as a screening test or 
to support the diagnosis where cultures have been negative. A positive tuberculin test 
is still signifi cant, even if the patient has received a bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) 
vaccination in the past. Remember, if the patient is in a high-risk group (HIV positive, 
immunosuppressed, in close contact with a clear-cut case of TB or has evidence of 
prior TB on chest X-ray), the Mantoux test is considered positive with just 5 mm of 
induration (vs 15 mm in low-risk patients). 
 6.  Find out what treatment regimen the patient is receiving. Considerable detail must 
be sought about the drugs themselves – doses (if known), how long treatment will 
continue, how the drugs are administered (supervised or unsupervised) and what 
side-eff ects have occurred ( Table 6.23 ). Remember that rifampicin and rifabutin 
colour body fl uids, including urine, orange. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What effect has the disease had on  this patient ’ s childhood – school, sport, making 
friends? 
 2.  What do you think  this patient ’ s prognosis is? Is he or she aware of the outlook? 
 3.  What strategy has the patient for a sudden worsening of symptoms? 
 4.  How would you assess  this patient ’ s nutritional state? 
 5.  How would you manage  this patient ’ s underweight problem? 
 
 
142
Examination Medicine
 7.  Ask whether there has been a trigger for reactivation of previous infection (diabetes 
mellitus, old age, HIV infection). 
 8.  Find out what eff ect this serious and chronic disease has had on the patient ’ s life. 
Has the patient been able to work or go to school? Do friends and workmates know 
the diagnosis? Does the patient ’ s occupation involve a public health risk? 
 9.  Establish how the problem has been handled from a public health aspect. What 
screening has been done on the patient ’ s family and friends? Are any of the family 
also being treated? 
 The examination 
 Early in the course of the illness there may be no specifi c signs. Of those patients without 
HIV infection who have TB, 80% have only pulmonary disease. However, the majority 
of patients with HIV and TB have both extrapulmonary and pulmonary disease.
 1.  Note the patient ’ s general appearance. Look for wasting and cachexia that may be 
associated with the risk factors for TB (HIV, alcoholism) or may be a result of the 
disease (which is also known as consumption for this reason). 
 2.  Examine the lungs for signs of the aggressive primary infection that can occur in 
immunocompromised patients. Th ese include a pleural eff usion or tuberculous empyema 
and lobar collapse (as a result of lymphadenopathy and bronchial obstruction). 
 3.  Post-primary disease is more common in adults. Th ere is almost always a loose cough 
and often haemoptysis. Th ere may be no abnormal fi ndings, but you should look 
especially for upper lobe signs, including coarse crackles and wheezes due to partial 
bronchial obstruction caused by lymphadenopathy, and the rare amphoric breath 
sounds that occur over a cavity. 
 4.  Extrapulmonary disease most commonly involves the lymph nodes (especially in HIV 
patients). Examine all the palpable lymph node groups. Th e most often aff ected are 
the cervical and supraclavicular nodes. Th ere is usually painless swelling. 
 5.  Involvement of the genitourinary tract can be associated with haematuria and tenderness 
over the fl anks. 
 6.  Th e bones are involved in a small number of cases. Th e lumbar spine (Pott ’ s disease), 
hips and knees are most aff ected. Collapse of the vertebral bodies may cause kyphosis 
and even paraplegia. 
 7.  Tuberculous pericarditis can cause symptoms and signs of pericarditis and occasionally 
tamponade.

 8.  Abdominal TB can cause various gastrointestinal signs. Th ere may be a palpable 
abdominal mass. Severe abdominal tenderness suggests tuberculous peritonitis. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Th e diagnosis of active disease depends on microscopy of a specimen that shows 
mycobacteria (e.g. send three morning sputum specimens on separate days, followed 
by confi rmation by culture of the organism). Traditionally, specimens of sputum or 
gastric or bronchial washings (often useful for children), or a lymph node biopsy, 
are stained with the Ziehl–Neelsen stain. Modern laboratories are more likely to use 
auramine–rhodamine stains and fl uorescence microscopy. Only about 60% of patients 
with eventually proven TB have positive microscopy. Culture of the organism takes 
about 6 weeks, but is needed for the defi nitive diagnosis. Th ese organisms should then 
be tested for sensitivity to the main antituberculous drugs. Th is takes up to 8 more 
weeks. If multidrug resistance (MDRTB) is suspected, the  rpo gene can be tested: 
it is responsible for 95% of rifampicin resistance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
testing can now provide rapid identifi cation of  M. tuberculosis , but is not available 
everywhere and does not distinguish between viable and non-viable organisms. 
 2.  A QuantiFERON-TB Gold–interferon-gamma (IFN- γ ) assay is sensitive for the diagnosis 
of mycobacterial infection with some false positives for atypical mycobacteria. 
 3.  A chest X-ray showing the typical pattern of infi ltrates and cavities in the upper lobe 
strongly suggests the diagnosis, but many other patterns are consistent with TB ( Figs 
6.13–6.15 ). 
 4.  Th e Mantoux (purifi ed protein derivative, PPD) test needs to be carefully interpreted 
( Table 6.24 ). A positive test depends on the patient ’ s risk of having TB. Tuberculin 
skin testing is useful for screening for latent TB. Th e test may be negative in severe 
disease (e.g. in up to 50% of cases of miliary TB), in those who are immunosuppressed, 
including the elderly, or if exposure is only recent (repeat in 3 months). IFN- γ release 
assays use a specifi c tuberculosis antigen to stimulate release of IFN- γ from T cells

in vitro. Th ese tests are more specifi c than tuberculin testing and may be useful where 
rates of TB are low. Th ey are not aff ected by previous BCG vaccination. A positive 
screening test should be followed by a chest X-ray to look for active disease. 
 5.  Biopsies of the pleura, lymph nodes or bone marrow may be needed. Bronchoscopy 
is sometimes necessary to exclude other causes of X-ray changes. 
 6.  Th e fasting blood sugar level should be taken to rule out diabetes mellitus. 
 7.  HIV patients may have TB despite a completely normal chest X-ray. Th ey may also 
have less typical chest X-ray fi ndings – often lower lobe changes without cavities. 
Th ey are more likely to have infection with other mycobacteria, such as MAC. Remember 
that the diagnosis can be made even when the organism is not isolated. All patients 
with TB should be tested for HIV infection. 
 Treatment 
 Th ere are four fi rst-line drugs for the treatment of TB: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol 
and pyrazinamide. Th ese are all given orally. Second-line drugs tend to be more toxic and 
are used only for organisms resistant to the fi rst-line drugs. Th ey include moxifl oxacin, 
streptomycin, quinolone, kanamycin and amikacin (parenteral), and cycloserine, ethionamide 
and PAS (para-aminosalicylic acid). Th e initial isolate should undergo drug susceptibility 
testing, especially if treatment seems to have failed or there is a relapse of symptoms. 
 Treatment of latent TB reduces the risk of transmission and the risk of progression 
to active disease by up to 90%. Nine months of treatment with isoniazid is commonly 
recommended.
 1.  Treatment begins with a combination regimen of three drugs (usually isoniazid, 
rifampicin and pyrazinamide) for 2 months. A fourth drug (usually ethambutol) is

right upper zone (black arrow). The right hilum is enlarged by the enlarged draining 
lymph nodes (open arrow). This combination of focal shadowing and enlarged

occur in the parenchymal and nodal lesions. In contrast, in TB reactivation or 
re-infection, cavitation may occur and there is no lymphadenopathy.

Examination Medicine
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How would you decide whether  this patient ’ s antituberculous treatment is adequate 
and when it might be stopped? 
 2.  How would you screen a patient about to start a biological agent for TB? 
often given until the organism ’ s sensitivities are available. Th e aim here is to kill the 
majority of the organisms, improve the patient ’ s symptoms and render him or her 
non-infectious. Th is is followed by 4 months of treatment with two drugs (isoniazid 
and rifampicin). 
 2.  Adherence to the full course of treatment is very important, but diffi  cult to ensure. 
Complicated public health arrangements, with monitoring of compliance, may be 
needed to enforce treatment. Direct observed treatment (DOT) is insisted on by 
public health authorities if compliance seems doubtful. Th ese patients present as 
required to be observed taking their treatment. 
 3.  Th e response to treatment is monitored by repeat sputum cultures until they become 
negative. Persisting positive cultures after 3 months suggest resistance of the organism 
or non-adherence on the part of the patient. Patients are probably not an infectious 
risk if no sputum is produced or if the sputum is consistently acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 
negative. 
 4.  Patients need to be aware of the most important side-eff ects of treatment, which 
include hepatitis (up to 5% in the general population and 30% in HIV patients), 
deafness and visual disturbance (see  Table 6.23 ). Small increases in the transaminases 
(to three times normal) are no cause for alarm and are poor predictors of signifi cant 
hepatotoxicity. Treatment should be reviewed immediately if jaundice develops. 
 5.  Multiple drug resistance is becoming increasingly common and should be expected 
if the infection was acquired from a patient with a known resistant organism or if 
the infection was acquired in parts of Asia or South America. Th e addition of a 
fl uoroquinolone to the regimen should be considered while resistance studies are 
under way. 
 6.  Prevention of infection by vaccination with BCG is not widely practised in Australia; 
its eff ectiveness is uncertain. In high-risk areas, vaccination of children has been 
shown to reduce the risk of cerebral TB. Th e Mantoux test should be interpreted as 
usual regardless of previous BCG vaccination (15 mm is a positive skin test for 
low-risk individuals). If the Mantoux test is positive ( ≥ 5 mm) in a high-risk group 
(patients with exposure to TB (especially household contacts), or who are HIV infected, 
on prolonged steroid treatment ( ≥ 15 mg  ≥ 1 month) or have undergone organ 
transplant), prescribe treatment with isoniazid for latent TB (5 mg / kg / day for 9 
months). If close (e.g. household) contacts are negative on the tuberculin test, treat 
for 12 weeks and repeat the skin test: this reduces the chance of the development of 
open TB by 90%. If the test is  ≥ 10 mm in an intermediate-risk group (IV drug 
abusers, prisoners, healthcare workers, nursing-home patients, homeless people or 
those with diabetes), also treat with isoniazid. Screening of contacts and high-risk 
patients with tuberculin testing is an important public health measure. 
 7.  Patients starting on biological agents for infl ammatory disease should be screened for 
possible TB with QuantiFERON-TB Gold serology and, if positive, a chest X-ray.

6 • The respiratory long case
 Lung transplantation 
 Although lung transplantation is an uncommon procedure, transplant patients have 
chronic management problems that make them very suitable long cases. Fifty percent 
10-year survival is now achieved in experienced centres. Th e examiners will have the 
opportunity to ask questions about the patient ’ s underlying pulmonary problem, the 
general indications for lung transplant, management of the complications of transplant 
and, of course, the types of social problems associated with a severe chronic illness. 
Occasionally, patients who are being assessed for possible transplant may be suitable for 
the clinical examinations. 
 The history 
 1.  Find out why the patient is in hospital (it is probably just for the clinical examinations). 
 2.  Obtain some basic information about the transplant: how long ago, how many lungs 
were transplanted and whether the patient ’ s heart was also originally someone else ’ s. 
 3.  Enquire what the original lung disease was. Emphysema (including that caused by 
alpha 1 -antitrypsin defi ciency) is the most common indication, accounting for about 
half of the unilateral transplants and one-third of the bilateral transplants. Idiopathic 
pulmonary hypertension, cystic fi brosis and Eisenmenger ’ s syndrome are the main 
indications for heart / lung transplants. 
 4.  Ask how successful the procedure has been from the patient ’ s point of view. Lung 
function tests should be normal after bilateral transplant and nearly so after unilateral 
transplant. A decline in lung function test measurements of more than 10% usually 
is important. Patients are often aware of their results. 
 5.  Find out what complications the patient can remember. Ask about known rejection 
episodes and how they were managed. Have there been diffi  cult infections? Th e 
patient may know what organisms have been detected. Stenosis of a bronchial 
anastomosis site is an occasional early problem. Th is is often treated with dilatation 
and stenting. 
 6.  Review what medications the patient is taking. If necessary, prompt for prednisolone, 
cyclosporin, mycophenolate, azathioprine and tacrolimus. Find out whether blood 
levels of tacrolimus and cyclosporin are measured regularly. Remember that these two 
drugs are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 pathway in the liver and blood levels 
may be aff ected by other medications (so make sure you review all of the drugs being 
taken). 
 7.  If the patient is being assessed for transplant, try to fi nd out whether the patient fi ts 
the current guidelines for transplant ( Tables 6.25 and  6.26 ). In general, suitable 
patients are sick enough to require the operation but not too sick to present an 
intolerable operative risk. 
 8.  Establish how the patient has coped with the procedure, its complications and the 
immunosuppressants. What regular follow-up is carried out? Many transplant units 
have a transplant nurse available after hours whom the patient can contact directly 
if there are problems.

Examination Medicine
 The examination 
 Perform a thorough respiratory examination.
 1.  Look especially for thoracotomy scars and attempt an assessment of the patient ’ s 
functional capacity (e.g. look for signs of breathlessness while the patient is undressing 
and, if the room is big enough, get the patient to walk backwards and forwards). An 
anterior submammary scar is often present. Patients with unilateral transplants will 
often have a normal lung examination on the side with the scar and signs of the 
original disease on the other side (e.g. the crackles of interstitial disease). 
 2.  Listen for end-inspiratory pops and squeaks (bronchiolitis obliterans at an advanced 
stage can be associated with the development of bronchiectasis). 
 3.  Note signs of infection – fever and areas of bronchial breathing or crackles. 
 4.  Look for sputum and assess the cough. 
 5.  Is the patient Cushingoid? 
 Management 
 Th e detection of complications and their management is likely to dominate the 
discussion.
 1.  Rejection: early rejection episodes are common and are treated with boost doses of 
prednisone. Symptoms of acute rejection include malaise, fever, dyspnoea and cough. 
Clinical assessment may reveal crackles, decreasing FEV 1 , hypoxia and a raised white 
cell count. Th e chest X-ray may show infi ltrates and pleural eff usions. A transbronchial 
biopsy tends to be performed if there is any suspicion of rejection and allows an 
accurate diagnosis. In some places, routine biopsies are performed to detect asymptomatic 
rejection. It is not clear, however, whether these should be treated. 
 2.  Infection: most lung transplant patients develop infections requiring treatment. 
Infection is the most common cause of death. A combination of immunosuppression 
and local problems, such as impaired ciliary activity, are relevant. Infections with 
cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, infl uenza A and paramyxovirus are common 
and associated with a signifi cant mortality. Invasive fungal organisms, such as  Aspergillus , 
result in an even worse prognosis. Patients now receive at least 3 months of routine 
prophylactic antibiotic, antiviral and antifungal treatment. Th is approach has improved 
the early postoperative prognosis.

 3.  Immunosuppression: the usual problems with immunosuppressive drugs occur in 
lung transplant patients. Renal impairment, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia are 
frequent problems. Osteoporosis and peripheral neuropathy are also seen. Five per 
cent of lung transplant patients develop lymphoproliferative disorders. 
 4.  Bronchiolitis obliterans: the gradual onset of small airways obstruction is a manifesta-
tion of chronic rejection. It does not usually begin until 2 or more years after transplant, 
but is detectable in at least half of transplant patients within 5 years. It may occur 
more often in those who have had more frequent acute rejection episodes and in 
those with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch with the donor. Th ere tends 
to be a very gradual onset of dyspnoea, fatigue and cough. Patients have a slowly 
decreasing FEV 1 but chest X-rays are often normal. CT scans may show a central 
mottling opacity. Biopsy will establish the diagnosis. Th e prognosis is not good. 
Sometimes an aggressive increase in immunosuppression may stabilise the condition, 
but it cannot be reversed and often the patient deteriorates rapidly. 
 5.  Disease recurrence: sarcoidosis and some forms of idiopathic ILD can recur in the 
transplanted lungs. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What happened to  this patient during the period after the transplant? Were there 
complications, extended stays in an ICU, etc.? 
 2.  What would make you suspect a rejection episode; how would you manage it? 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
 Although candidates will not encounter active COVID-19 in the long-case examination, 
patients who have been infected may be encountered. Th e examiners will then have the 
opportunity to ask you about the presentation, diagnosis, treatment (and complications), 
disease course and long-term outcome. Th e discussion about issues may range from 
respiratory failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome) to cardiac and thrombolitic 
complications, and infl ammatory complications such as Guillain–Barré syndrome or 
multisystem infl ammatory syndrome (Kawasaki-like disease). Th e physical and psychological 
complications will be important to understand and manage. Many patients have prolonged 
symptoms after infection and may be disabled, and you will need to know and describe 
the details.

of mast cells). Intestinal transit may be increased or decreased, with some evidence of 
abnormal serotonin signalling. 
 The diagnosis 
 If the presentation is typical ( Box 7.1 ) and there are NO alarm features ( Box 7.2 ) then 
IBS can be positively diagnosed clinically with no further investigations. 
 The examination 
 Th e gastrointestinal examination is usually normal. Th ere may be scars from previous 
surgery (e.g. misdiagnosed acute appendix or gallbladder disease). Mild tenderness may 
be present – always exclude abdominal wall pain (Carnett ’ s test should be negative – i.e. 
no increased tenderness on tensing the abdominal wall muscles). 
 Investigations 
 1.  Coeliac disease can be confused with IBS and serological testing is recommended on 
a gluten-containing diet, especially if there is diarrhoea. 
 2.  A blood count to rule out anaemia and a C-reactive protein (CRP) or stool calprotectin 
to look for evidence of infl ammatory bowel disease (IBD) is helpful. 
 3.  Routine testing for thyroid function, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 
and stool for ova and parasites is not recommended. A food diary may help to identify 
lactose intolerance as the problem. Food allergy testing is not recommended. Colo-
noscopy should generally be performed only if alarm symptoms (e.g. recent symptoms 
in an older patient) are present. 
 Management 
 Begin with explanation and reassurance.

 2.  A low FODMAP diet (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides 
and polyols) followed by slowly reintroducing excluded food groups to identify the 
poorly tolerated foods can help over 50%, but compliance can be an issue. 
 3.  Osmotic laxatives help constipation but not abdominal discomfort. 
 4.  Loperamide can improve diarrhoea (stool consistency and frequency), but not other 
symptoms. A bile salt binder can help diarrhoea in a subset with IBS and bile salt 
overfl ow into the colon, inducing secretion. 
 5.  Mebeverine or peppermint oil may help reduce abdominal pain. 
 6.  Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants improve pain and other symptoms (number needed 
to treat  = 4). Th ey can be more helpful for IBS diarrhoea because of their anticholinergic 
eff ects. 
 7.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are at best modestly eff ective, but 
may help constipation more than diarrhoea (by increasing gut serotonin). 
 8.  Narcotics should be avoided (because of dependency and constipation, plus they 
can paradoxically exacerbate pain). 
 9.  Th ese patients are at risk of having their gallbladder and appendix unnecessarily 
removed, and these surgical interventions should be discouraged unless there is a 
very clear indication. 
 10.  Life expectancy is not altered, and a minority with IBS will spontaneously resolve 
over time, but any change in symptoms should be taken seriously. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Do you think any further investigations are indicated for  this patient? 
 2.  If  this patient asked to try a series of exclusion diets, what would you recommend? 
 Peptic ulceration 
 Th is long case is usually a straightforward management problem. Th e most important 
causes of chronic peptic ulcer disease are  Helicobacter pylori infection and traditional 
non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low-dose aspirin. Th e 
COX-2-specifi c NSAIDs have a lower incidence of peptic ulceration. Idiopathic ulcers 
( H. pylori negative, NSAID negative) are increasingly being reported. Th e Zollinger–Ellison 
syndrome (gastrinoma) is a very rare but important cause. Patients are usually admitted 
to hospital with peptic ulcer disease because of complications – typically haemorrhage, 
but more rarely perforation. 
 The history 
 1.  Determine whether the patient currently has dyspepsia or a past history of dyspepsia 
(i.e. epigastric pain or discomfort, early satiety or postprandial fullness; bloating and 
heartburn are not considered dyspepsia symptoms). Typical ulcer symptoms include 
burning or sharp epigastric pain related to meals, or may wake the patient from sleep 
at night, and are relieved by antacids or antisecretory drugs. However, many patients 
with these symptoms do  not have peptic ulcer disease, and ulcers are often associated 
with atypical symptoms. Duodenal and gastric ulcers cannot be distinguished from 
one another on the basis of symptoms. Th e diff erential diagnosis of dyspepsia includes 
functional dyspepsia (a gastroduodenal motility disorder), gastro-oesophageal refl ux 
 
 
153
7 • The gastrointestinal long case
disease (usually also causing heartburn or acid regurgitation), gastric cancer (especially 
in older patients with new onset of symptoms or with alarm features such as weight 
loss), biliary pain (typically severe, constant pain in the right upper quadrant or 
epigastrium that occurs episodically and unpredictably and lasts at least 20 minutes, 
but usually hours), chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer or intestinal angina (chronic 
mesenteric ischaemia, which causes severe postprandial pain such that the patient is 
afraid to eat and loses weight). 
 2.  Diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, hyperparathyroidism and connective tissue 
diseases can also cause dyspepsia. 
 3.  Ask about the course of the symptoms and, if intermittent, the number of recurrences 
and treatments given. Ask about other alarm symptoms, such as recurrent vomiting 
(e.g. gastric outlet obstruction) or weight loss. Gastroparesis is rare and usually presents 
with recurrent vomiting, weight loss and abdominal pain. 
 4.  Ask about the types of investigations the patient has had in the past. If an ulcer was 
apparently documented, determine whether this was by endoscopy (the most sensitive 
and specifi c test), or just by symptoms alone (which is not enough for a defi nite 
diagnosis). Determine whether the patient knows if  H. pylori status was determined 
from gastric biopsies or by non-invasive tests, such as urea breath testing, stool antigen 
testing or serology (can remain positive after successful eradication so serology is not 
a gold standard test). 
 5.  A history of past ulcer or other gastric surgery is important because of the associated 
complications (e.g. pain or bloating owing to bile refl ux gastritis or an aff erent loop 
syndrome, recurrent ulceration, early or late dumping, post-vagotomy diarrhoea, 
anaemia as a result of iron, vitamin B 12 or folate defi ciency, and osteomalacia or 
osteoporosis). 
 6.  Ask about the family history: a strong family history of peptic ulcer may refl ect the 
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1 syndrome. 
 7.  Enquire carefully about medication use – medications (e.g. digoxin, potassium, iron, 
oral antibiotics) can induce dyspepsia, which can be confused with peptic ulcer.  All 
NSAIDs are an important cause of dyspepsia with or without chronic ulceration. 
Alcohol can also induce acute dyspepsia (but not chronic ulcers). Patients with an 
ulcer history may be taking maintenance acid suppression. First-line treatment for 
 H. pylori usually includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus two antibiotics (amoxicillin 
and clarithromycin) for 7 days, but 30%–40% now fail, and should progress to 
second-line treatment. 
 8.  Ask about anticoagulation, including NOACs (novel (non-vitamin-K) oral antico-
agulants). Anticoagulation increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 
 9.  If relevant, determine why the patient is in hospital on this occasion. If the admission 
is because of acute gastrointestinal bleeding, then the treatment applied needs to be 
documented. Bleeding can be the only symptom of peptic ulcer, and older ( > 70) 
patients and those at a higher dose of NSAIDs are at a higher risk. Urgent endoscopy 
is done to treat current severe bleeding or to prevent rebleeding. Remember that 
morbidity (e.g. need for transfusion, rebleeding rates) but not mortality is improved 
with oral or intravenous PPIs. A conservative transfusion strategy (transfusing if Hb 
 < 70 g / L, in stable patients) is associated with improved survival. 
 The examination 
 Physical examination in patients with suspected peptic ulcer disease is usually unhelpful. 
Epigastric tenderness is not a specifi c sign. An upper abdominal scar may indicate past 
ulcer surgery. Look for alarm signs, including evidence of anaemia (e.g. from bleeding) 
 
 
154
Examination Medicine
or current bleeding (melaena, tachycardia, postural hypotension), or an abdominal mass 
or lymphadenopathy (e.g. gastric or pancreatic carcinoma). 
 Investigations 
 1.  Endoscopy: this is the standard test for determining that an active peptic ulcer is 
present. It is also the key test in a patient with upper gastrointestinal bleeding to 
determine whether the patient is at high risk of rebleeding and also to provide 
endoscopic therapy where required. Patients with active bleeding or a visible vessel 
at endoscopy need endoscopic therapy (e.g. injection with adrenaline (epinephrine) 
followed by coagulation with a heater probe). Patients with a low risk of rebleeding 
(i.e. a clean ulcer base) can be discharged immediately, if stable. Th ose at higher risk 
for rebleeding require admission for PPI therapy and observation. For patients with 
upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, it is important to exclude other causes by 
endoscopy, including variceal bleeding, erosions, angiodysplasia, a Mallory–Weiss 
tear or a Dieulafoy ’ s lesion (rupture of a large submucosal artery). Alternative causes 
of dyspepsia may be found at endoscopy including occasionally gastric cancer or 
MALT lymphoma. Where possible, biopsies should be obtained at a diagnostic 
endoscopy in ulcer patients to determine the  H. pylori status (but false-negative results 
can occur in the setting of upper GI bleeding). 
 2.  Abdominal imaging: in the patient with unexplained severe dyspepsia where endoscopy 
is normal, ultrasound can be useful in certain clinical circumstances to investigate 
for biliary tract pathology. CT scanning is more sensitive for pancreatic disease. 
 3.  Atypical peptic ulcer: peptic ulceration in an unusual location, peptic ulcers resistant 
to therapy, an ulcer relapse after operation, or frequent or early ulcer recurrence can 
occur in the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Th is syndrome can also be associated with 
enlarged duodenal or gastric folds, or diarrhoea or steatorrhoea. Th e diagnosis is made 
by measuring the fasting serum gastrin level:  > 300 pg / mL is suggestive and  > 
1000 pg / mL is almost diagnostic (remember on a PPI the gastrin level will often be 
raised, but usually not above 300 pg / mL). Acid secretion can be confi rmed by testing 
the pH of gastric juice obtained at endoscopy. Preoperative localisation of the tumour 
is then attempted by CT or MRI scanning, and somatostatin receptor-based imaging 
(e.g. dotatate PET scan). If unable to locate the tumour, endoscopic ultrasound can 
be utilised, or, if necessary, angiographic venous sampling. In patients with metastatic 
or multifocal disease, surgery is avoided, but all other cases require surgical exploration. 
High-dose PPIs are used to control the disease medically. 
 Remember that hypergastrinaemia also occurs in hypochlorhydria (gastric pH is not 
acidic; e.g. in atrophic gastritis and pernicious anaemia, following vagotomy, on a PPI, 
or with chronic kidney disease). Other causes of hypergastrinaemia with acid hypersecretion 
include a retained gastric antrum after peptic ulcer surgery, massive small bowel resection, 
gastric outlet obstruction and thyrotoxicosis. If hypercalcaemia is present in patients 
with ulcer disease, this may suggest MEN1 (with hyperplasia, adenoma or carcinoma 
of the parathyroid, pituitary and pancreatic islets; hyperparathyroidism and pituitary 
adenoma are most often associated with the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome in MEN1). In 
MEN1 (autosomal dominant with variable penetrance), there is often a strong family 
history of peptic ulcer disease. 
 Treatment 
 1.  Th ere is consensus that, if peptic ulcer disease is documented and  H. pylori is present, 
this infection should be treated. Most duodenal ulcers will be cured by this approach, 
as will most gastric ulcers unless associated with NSAID use. 
 
 
155
7 • The gastrointestinal long case
 2.  Th e optimal approach for curative treatment of  H. pylori is currently three drugs (e.g. 
PPI plus amoxicillin plus clarithromycin), which give cure rates of approximately 
60%–70%. Side-eff ects occur with such treatment in up to 20% of cases. 
 3.  Patients with gastric ulcers may be advised to have a repeat gastroscopy to confi rm 
healing and exclude carcinoma. However, 98% of cancers will be detected at the 
initial gastroscopy and biopsy. Th erefore, repeat endoscopy is usually recommended 
only if symptoms have not been relieved or no initial biopsies were obtained. Duodenal 
ulcers do not require follow-up endoscopy. 
 4.  In peptic ulcer disease, confi rm that  H. pylori infection has been cured (e.g. by repeat 
endoscopic biopsy, or urea breath testing or stool antigen testing, at least 1 month 
after completing treatment). 
 5.  NSAID ulcers should initially be treated with a PPI, which is eff ective even if the 
NSAID is continued (although this does delay healing). 
 6.  PPIs are more eff ective than histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists in promoting ulcer 
healing. NSAID use is an independent risk factor for peptic ulcer and therefore 
eradication of  H .  pylori in this situation may not prevent ulcer disease if NSAIDs are 
continued. 
 7.  Certain patients taking traditional NSAIDs have a higher risk of ulcer complications. 
Th ese include elderly patients, those having their fi rst 3 months of treatment, those 
on higher doses, those with a past history of peptic ulcer, those taking concomitant 
corticosteroid therapy or anticoagulants, and those with other serious medical illnesses. 
NSAID ulcers often present with complications without a history of dyspepsia because 
these drugs are analgesic agents that may mask symptoms. Th e prostaglandin E 1 analogue 
misoprostol and PPIs both substantially reduce the risk of NSAID-induced gastric and 
duodenal ulcers; histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists in standard doses do not prevent 
NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.  H. pylori eradication before treatment reduces, but does 
not eliminate, the risk of aspirin-induced ulcer development.  H. pylori eradication 
alone provides insuffi  cient protection from gastroduodenal complications arising from 
non-selective NSAID use in high-risk patients, who will still require a PPI. 
 8.  Long-term PPI use is generally safe, but PPIs can rarely cause hypomagnesaemia, and 
vitamin B 12 and iron malabsorption, possibly an increased risk of fractures from 
calcium malabsorption, microscopic colitis (diarrhoea), acute interstitial nephritis 
and drug-induced lupus. Th e risk of  Clostridium diffi  cile infection is increased. It is 
unclear whether PPI users are at an increased risk of pneumonia or dementia. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Should  this patient continue on a PPI? 
 2.  Should  this patient with atrial ﬁ brillation be anticoagulated? How would you explain 
the risks and beneﬁ ts to the patient? 
 3.  Should  this patient who is taking antiplatelet treatment be protected with a PPI? 
 Malabsorption and chronic diarrhoea 
 Th is can be a diffi  cult long case. It is usually a diagnostic problem. Coeliac disease 
( Table 7.1 ), chronic pancreatitis and previous gastric surgery account for 60% of cases 
of malabsorption.

 Table 7.1   Coeliac disease 
 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR COELIAC DISEASE 
 1.  Positive serology by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) on a gluten-containing diet 
 2.  Abnormal duodenal biopsy consistent with coeliac disease 
 3.  Clinical, biochemical and histological improvement on a gluten-free diet (no wheat, rye or barley) 
(histological retesting not routine) 
 Notes: Requiring relapse on reinstitution of gluten is rarely considered necessary today. 
 Splenomegaly in coeliac disease usually indicates that lymphoma has complicated the disease because 
otherwise splenic atrophy is characteristic and manifests with Howell–Jolly bodies in the peripheral blood 
smear.
 CAUSES OF LACK OF RESPONSE TO A GLUTEN-FREE DIET 
 1.  Incorrect diagnosis 
 2.  Patient not adhering to the diet 
 3.  Collagenous sprue 
 4.  Refractory coeliac disease (may have no response initially or relapse after a period of remission on a 
gluten-free diet – type I does not progress to lymphoma while type II has an abnormal clone of 
intraepithelial lymphocytes and can progress to T-cell lymphoma) 
 5.  Intestinal lymphoma 
 6.  Diffuse ulceration 
 7.  Other intercurrent disease, e.g. lactose intolerance, pancreatic insufﬁ ciency, microscopic colitis, small 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth 
 COMPLICATIONS OF COELIAC DISEASE 
 1.  T cell lymphoma 
 2.  Ulceration of the small bowel 
 3.  Incidence of carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract is generally slightly increased 
 4.  Osteoporosis

 5.  Enquire about family history (e.g. coeliac disease, infl ammatory bowel disease). 
 6.  Ask about faecal incontinence secondary to diarrhoea, the impact of symptoms, and 
social problems related to the chronic illness. 
 The examination 
 Pay particular attention to the current weight and nutritional status (e.g. BMI), the 
presence of abdominal scars, skin lesions (e.g. bruising, dermatitis herpetiformis (see 
 Fig. 7.2 ), pigmentation ( Fig. 7.3 ), erythema nodosum (see  Fig. 7.6 ), pyoderma gan-
grenosum (see  Fig. 7.5 ), stomatitis, perianal lesions), signs of anaemia, oedema, signs 
of chronic liver disease, signs of peripheral neuropathy and lymphadenopathy. 
 Investigations ( Table 7.2 ) 
 1.  Demonstrate malabsorption:
 a.  the ‘big six’ laboratory screen tests – look for a low serum iron, prolonged international 
normalised ratio (INR), low calcium, low cholesterol, low carotene and a positive 
Sudan stain of the stool for fat (which is a good screening test for steatorrhoea) 
 b.  faecal fat estimation over 3 days – more than 7 g per day is abnormal; note that 
patients with severe small bowel diarrhoea of any cause without fat malabsorption 
may lose up to 14 g per day; this gold standard test is very useful if you strongly

suspect fat malabsorption based on the screening evaluation, but this test is now 
not widely available; if chronic pancreatitis is possible (e.g. history of alcohol 
abuse), order a faecal elastase 
 c.  glucose (or the less accurate lactulose) breath hydrogen test – for small intestinal 
bacterial overgrowth (SIBO); think about this possibility in the setting of macrocytosis 
with a high folate and low B 12 level, or in patients with structural, motility or 
immunoglobulin defi ciency disorders that predispose to bacterial overgrowth. 
 2.  Evaluate the consequences:
 a.  blood count with particular attention to red cell indices 
 b.  serum iron and ferritin, serum and red cell folate, and vitamin B 12 studies 
 c.  serum albumin estimation 
 d.  vitamin D level (25-OH vitamin D), serum calcium, phosphate and alkaline 
phosphatase estimations 
 e.  clotting profi le – INR 
 f.  cholesterol and carotene. 
 3.  Find the cause.
 a.  Check small bowel X-ray fi lms for localised disease (e.g. Crohn ’ s disease or anatomical 
causes of bacterial overgrowth such as diverticula or blind loops). 
 b.  Check gastroscopy and small bowel biopsy (the optimal number for diagnosis of 
coeliac disease is four duodenal biopsies from the second portion of duodenum 
and two from the fi rst portion of duodenum as disease can be patchy); note if 
multiple duodenal ulcers (e.g. as a result of Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, lymphoma, 
jejunoileitis). 
 Subtotal villous atrophy may be present histologically in:
 •  coeliac disease 
 •  collagenous sprue 
 •  SIBO 
 •  tropical sprue 
 •  giardiasis 
 •  lymphoma 
 •  hypogammaglobulinaemia 
 •  Whipple ’ s disease 
 •  medications including olmesartan, ipilimumab or methotrexate. 
 Note that tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is the most useful screening test for 
coeliac disease as long as the patient is still eating a gluten-containing diet. Remember

that 2% of the population is IgA defi cient and will have negative serology, so check 
IgA levels if testing is negative and your suspicion is high. Do not rely on antigliadin 
antibodies. HLA genotyping has a good negative predictive value, and is particularly 
useful (if negative) in symptomatic individuals with a family history of coeliac 
disease or those who are self-treating with a gluten free diet. 
 Serology is not a substitute for small bowel biopsy, which remains the gold 
standard test if coeliac disease is suspected in adults. 
 c.  Vitamin B 12 absorption may be abnormal in ileal disease, bacterial overgrowth, 
pernicious anaemia or pancreatic disease. 
 d.  Greatly raised faecal fat levels ( > 40 g per day) strongly suggest pancreatic disease, but 
this test is now uncommonly available. An alternative is faecal elastase testing (note 
that watery diarrhoea can cause a false-positive result). Suspected pancreatic disease is 
investigated by plain abdominal X-ray fi lms (for calcifi cation), CT scan (pancreatic 
protocol) and, if needed, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or 
endoscopic ultrasound; pancreatic function testing is not performed routinely. 
 Treatment 
 Treatment depends on the cause and also involves the replacement of essential nutrients 
( Table 7.3 ). 
 Management of coeliac disease 
 Coeliac disease is a commonly missed diagnosis! Have a low threshold for ordering 
serology; patients may present with no gastrointestinal symptoms. Remember to consider 
the possibility of coeliac disease in a patient with no abdominal symptoms who has 
osteoporosis or osteomalacia, abnormal transaminases, new neuropsychiatric symptoms 
or unexplained iron defi ciency. In IgA defi ciency, the IgA and tTG may be falsely negative, 
and the serum IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) is the most sensitive and specifi c 
serology test. Small bowel biopsy on a gluten-containing diet (e.g. at least two slices of 
bread daily for 2 weeks) will confi rm the diagnosis.
 1.  Th e management of coeliac disease includes a gluten-free diet (exclusion of wheat, 
rye and barley; there is controversy about oats). Symptoms usually improve in weeks 
and histology in several months; tTG antibody normalises in 3–6 months. 
 2.  A strict diet does reduce disease complications. 
 3.  Lack of response to a gluten-free diet may be caused by inadvertent gluten exposure, 
the presence of another problem (e.g. lactose intolerance, pancreatic insuffi  ciency, 
bacterial overgrowth), refractory sprue (which may respond to corticosteroids) or 
lymphoma (T cell enteropathy: unresponsive to steroids). 
 4.  Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended because of the hyposplenism of coeliac disease. 
 5.  Osteoporosis is a complication to consider testing for and managing. 
 6.  IBD, microscopic colitis, thyroid dysregulation and adrenal insuffi  ciency not only 
mimic clinical features of coeliac disease but can also coexist with it. 
 7.  Latent coeliac disease can be diagnosed if the small bowel biopsy appears normal but 
there is positive tTG serology. For these patients, a gluten-free diet is not usually 
recommended, but follow-up with repeat biopsy is indicated if the symptoms recur. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How would you investigate  this patient for malnutrition? 
 2.  How would you reassess  this patient ’ s diagnosis of coeliac disease?

 4.  Ask about medications – NSAIDs, retinoic acid and possibly oral contraceptives 
can cause a similar picture. 
 5.  Determine the investigations at the time of presentation and subsequently (and 
particularly whether infectious causes were considered). 
 6.  Ask about the number of hospital admissions and a detailed surgical history (you 
must establish the full disease course). 
 7.  Ask whether regular follow-up colonoscopy has been performed in patients with 
longstanding colitis to demonstrate adequate control on current treatment and for 
colorectal cancer surveillance. 
 8.  Find out about treatment, including medications and any side-eff ects – such as 
sulfasalazine / 5-aminosalicylic acid preparations (mesalazine, olsalazine), local or 
systemic steroids (e.g. budesonide, prednisone), antibiotics (ciprofl oxacin, metronidazole 
or others that may cause pseudomembranous colitis), immunomodulators (e.g. 
azathioprine, mercaptopurine), and biologicals (anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) 
antibody drugs such as, for example, infl iximab or adalimumab, or anti-integrin 
vedolizumab, or anti IL12/23 antibody ustekinimab, etc.). 
 9.  Enquire about family history of IBD or bowel carcinoma. 
 10.  Ask about smoking – a greater proportion than average of Crohn ’ s disease patients 
are smokers and the risk of developing UC rises when people give up smoking. 
 11.  Ask about incontinence episodes, establish the current stoma care (if present) and 
enquire about the impact of the disease on their quality of life, including employment. 
 12.  Enquire about malnourishment symptoms and weight loss; fi nd out if they see a 
dietitian. 
 13.  Ask your patient about fertility and survivorship aspects, including screening of 
other malignancies (relevant in immunosuppression), bone mineral density and 
vaccinations. 
 The examination 
 A thorough gastrointestinal system examination is important. Evaluate the general state 
of nutrition and hydration. Examine any stoma if present: site, surrounding skin, number 
of lumens, spout, effl  uent (look and feel the bag – e.g. hard or soft stool), and ask 
about output (high or low) and complications. Feel for any tenderness or abdominal 
masses. Look for anal lesions externally ( Fig. 7.7 ). Always ask for the results of a rectal 
examination. Look for the signs of Cushing ’ s syndrome if the patient is taking steroids 
(often present!). Search for the other extracolonic manifestations, being guided by the 
history (e.g. arthropathy, skin lesions (see  p. 158 ), uveitis, anaemia, liver disease). 
 Investigations 
 It is important to exclude other causes of colitis ( Table 7.5 ). For the investigation of 
infl ammatory bowel disease, the following should be considered.
 1.  Infection must be excluded: the causes include amoebiasis (especially if a travel 
history – diagnosed by rectal mucosal scraping or warm stool examination),  Yersinia 
(if terminal ileitis),  Shigella ,  Salmonella ,  Campylobacter ,  Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and, 
if recent use of antibiotics or hospital admission, pseudomembranous colitis ( Clostridium 
diffi  cile toxin). Lymphogranuloma venereum (a chlamydial disease that is sexually 
transmitted), gonorrhoea and syphilis (particularly in men who have sex with men), 
and other infections in immunocompromised hosts (e.g. herpes, cytomegalovirus 
(CMV), cryptosporidium,  Isospora belli ) should be considered in patients at risk. 
 Remember that TB can, uncommonly, mimic Crohn ’ s disease. Also, reactivation 
of TB is a major risk with anti-TNF therapy; a chest X-ray and tuberculin skin test 
are mandatory before starting this therapy.

 7.  Toxic exposure (e.g. peroxide or soapsud enemas, gold-induced colitis) 
 8.  Diverticular disease – segmental colitis 
 2.  Plain abdominal X-ray fi lm: it is important to look for bowel wall thickening 
(oedema), gaseous distension and evidence of toxic megacolon in UC. In Crohn ’ s 
disease, also look for loops of matted bowel and small bowel obstruction. 
 3.  Blood count: check for anaemia (caused by chronic disease, blood loss, medications, 
macrocytic anaemia in ileal disease, or haemolytic anaemia from an autoimmune 
process, microangiopathic disease or sulfasalazine). Check the white cell count (e.g. 
leukopenia from azathioprine). Look at the ESR (or CRP) for evidence of active 
disease. 
 4.  Liver function tests and blood levels of electrolytes, urea and creatinine: these 
patients may develop liver disease, or it may be a complication of treatment (think 
primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with UC and cholestatic liver function 
derangement). Crohn ’ s disease may lead to renal stones, pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis 
or amyloidosis. Remember that hypoalbuminaemia is a sign of severe disease. 
 5.  Faecal calprotectin: this is a useful test, looking for active colonic ( + /  − small bowel) 
infl ammation. It is not specifi c for IBD, however, and can be elevated by other causes, 
e.g. infection. 
 6.  Colonoscopy: this is a very useful investigation to assess whether or not disease is 
patchy and, if so, to assess its extent. Note any decreased mucosal translucency, loss 
of vascular pattern, granular and friable mucosa, hyperaemia, ulceration and pseu-
dopolyps in the report. Ulcerative colitis always begins in the rectum and extends

proximally without skip lesions. Mucosal biopsies may not diff erentiate UC from 
Crohn ’ s disease or other causes of colitis, but mucus depletion and prominent crypt 
abscess formation are more suggestive of UC. Granulomas (in 25%) or focal infl am-
mation are found in Crohn ’ s colitis (but note that granulomas also occur in biopsies 
from  Chlamydia trachomatis and syphilitic proctitis or in cases of tuberculosis). Surveil-
lance colonoscopy (looking for dysplasia / malignancy) should occur every 1–3 years 
(depending on risk), beginning 8 years after diagnosis of at least distal UC, or Crohn ’ s 
colitis involving at least one-third of the colon. If severe infl ammation is present, 
assessment for dysplasia may be misleading. If high-grade dysplasia is found, endoscopic 
resection can be considered. Colectomy is another therapeutic option. 
 7.  Antibody testing: the presence of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies 
(p-ANCA) and anti- Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) does not make the 
diagnosis, but p-ANCA-negative and ASCA-positive patients are more likely to have 
Crohn ’ s disease than UC (the test is specifi c but not sensitive, and is not helpful in 
the initial assessment of suspected IBD). 
 Treatment 
 ULCERATIVE COLITIS 
 In UC, grade the severity of the disease:
 •  mild – fewer than four bowel motions per day, minimal bleeding, normal temperature 
and pulse 
 •  acute severe – more than six bloody bowel motions per day, plus at least one of: 
temperature  > 37.8°C, pulse  > 90 beats / min, haemoglobin  < 105 g / L, elevated ESR 
or CRP and raised infl ammatory markers 
 •  fulminant – as per the criteria for acute severe, plus 10 or more bloody bowel motions 
per day, usually accompanied by abdominal tenderness and/or distension.
 1.  In an acute attack of colitis, remember to correct hypokalaemia and obtain a plain 
abdominal X-ray to assess for toxic megacolon (risk of perforation). Do not prescribe 
opiates or anticholinergic agents to prevent megacolon. 
 2.  Arrange DVT prophylaxis. 
 3.  Send off  a stool sample looking for  Clostridium diffi  cile (which can still occur 
without recent antibiotics!) and other bacterial or viral infections that could mimic 
an exacerbation. 
 4.  Oral prednisone is usually utilised in the fi rst instance to gain disease control. In 
acute severe UC, intravenous steroids are the mainstay of treatment. In those who 
fail to respond (assessed after 3 days), both infl iximab (more common) and 
cyclosporin are considered as rescue therapies to try and avoid acute colectomy. 
In fulminant colitis, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics may be considered. Close 
cooperation with a surgeon who is interested in this fi eld and with a stoma therapist 
is important early on in severe disease; these consultations provide information 
and psychological support to the patient. 
 5.  In mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis, sulfasalazine or other 5-ASA agents are 
useful (induction doses are around 4 g daily) to both achieve and maintain remission. 
Sulfasalazine is 5-ASA linked with sulfapyridine, which is the cause of most intoler-
ance (allergic reactions such as skin rash – including Stevens–Johnson syndrome 
– and Heinz body haemolytic anaemia; and side-eff ects such as nausea, headache, 
folate defi ciency and reversible male infertility). Th e other 5-ASA agents (e.g. 
mesalazine, olsalazine, balsalazide) tend to be better tolerated. Steroids may be 
required to allow a patient to enter remission, but do NOT maintain remission, 
nor prevent relapse. Remember to correct iron and folate defi ciency if necessary. 
 
 
167
7 • The gastrointestinal long case
 6.  If proctitis is the problem, fi rst-line treatment is topical / rectal 5-ASAs,  + /  − oral 
5-ASAs (topical is superior to oral in proctitis, but the combination is more eff ective 
than either alone). Topical steroids can help, but do not maintain remission. 
 7.  Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) is useful if there are repeated episodes 
of UC. Side-eff ects include pancreatitis in 3% of patients and reversible bone 
marrow suppression in  < 10% of patients. Avoid methotrexate. Biological therapy 
can be considered if the disease is not responding to the above measures. 
 8.  Colectomy is ‘curative’ (though not without complications). Th is is partly why it 
is important to try and distinguish UC from Crohn ’ s disease (though a distinction 
cannot be made in up to 10% of patients). Indications for surgery include chronic 
ill-health and severe disease, complications (e.g. perforation, massive bleeding) and 
severe disease not responding to optimal medical treatment in 7–10 days. Patients 
with UC (especially if extensive disease) are also at high risk for colorectal cancer. 
If high-grade dysplasia is found on colonoscopy and biopsy, if not amenable to 
endoscopic resection then a colectomy is recommended. Although the standard 
Brooke ileostomy is the simplest procedure, the ileal pouch anal anastomosis is 
increasingly being used as it maintains intestinal continuity, although it does leave 
the patient with four to eight bowel movements daily, and sometimes with minor 
incontinence (20%), and is often complicated by pouchitis (in up to 50% of 
patients). Th e latter usually responds to treatment with metronidazole or probiotics. 
 CROHN ’ S DISEASE 
 You are more likely to encounter Crohn ’ s disease in the clinic and exam than ulcerative 
colitis. A rectal exam for fi stula is routine (the results will be provided for you). Small 
bowel imaging modalities (used to help diagnosis and / or assess disease extent) include 
CT enteroclysis or magnetic resonance (MR) enteroclysis or enterography. Capsule 
endoscopy is widely available, but remember the capsule may obstruct the small intestine 
in Crohn ’ s disease. Fistula can be evaluated by radiology (e.g. CT, MR and fi stulography) 
and examination under anaesthesia. 
 Always advise the patient to stop smoking. Always try to taper off  and stop steroids 
once the patient is in remission. Remember, disease always recurs after surgical resection 
and the risk increases with time. Th e goals of therapy are to control symptoms and try 
to achieve deep remission (endoscopy and histology returns to normal), so many clinicians 
are now more aggressive in introducing biological therapy early. A multidisciplinary 
team approach is needed to manage what can be a devastating disease in the long term.
 1.  5-ASA is not eff ective in Crohn ’ s disease, although it is sometimes tried in mild 
disease (not recommended). 
 2.  Steroids are eff ective for inducing remission but never for maintenance of remission. 
Budenoside (a steroid derivative that acts locally and is 90% inactivated by the liver) 
is useful in ileocolonic disease. 
 3.  Azathioprine (or 6-mercaptopurine) is useful for those who cannot cease steroids and 
to reduce risk of relapse (including post-resection surgery). Methotrexate is an alternative 
if azathioprine fails ( Table 7.6 ). 
 4.  With extensive ileal disease or resection, diarrhoea may respond to a bile-salt-sequestering 
drug (cholestyramine or colestipol). 
 5.  Biological therapy is used in moderate to severe disease, or disease not responding to 
other treatment. Options include anti-TNF agents (e.g. infl iximab, adalimumab), 
anti-integrin agents (e.g. vedolizumab) and anti-interleukin agents (e.g. ustekinumab) 
(see  Table 7.6 ). Th ese agents are used for both induction of remission and maintenance 
of remission. An anti-TNF (or ustekinumab) is preferred in fi stulising disease.

 6.  Metronidazole and / or ciprofl oxacin is modestly useful for severe perianal disease and

therapy may be tried in diffi  cult or severe cases. 
 7.  Surgery is reserved for the complications of Crohn ’ s disease (e.g. internal fi stula with abscess, 
intestinal obstruction not responding to medical management). Th e best operation is 
resection. Strictureplasty may allow relief of localised obstruction without the deleterious 
eff ects of multiple resections. Surgical resection is sometimes considered in preference to 
medical management in isolated, short-segment disease of the terminal ileum. 
 8.  When a total colectomy is needed, a standard ileostomy is the procedure of choice. 
Th e recurrence rate of the disease is unchanged by surgery. 
 9.  Th e extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) of IBD that respond to treatment of active 
disease include: oral ulcers, erythema nodosum, large joint arthritis and episcleritis.

ankylosing spondylitis, uveitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and renal stones and gallstones.

7 • The gastrointestinal long case
 Colon cancer 
 Th is is a particularly common tumour that usually develops in patients aged 50 years 
or more, although those at risk with hereditary syndromes will present at a younger 
age. Because early disease is curable, there has been increased interest in colon cancer 
screening. Hence, a history of polyps or colon cancer is increasingly likely to be encountered 
in the examination. 
 The history 
 1.  Th e patient may have been diagnosed recently as having a colon cancer. In this case, 
ascertain the reasons for diagnostic testing:
 a.  a recent change in bowel habit or bright red blood per rectum (from a rectal or 
left-sided colon cancer) 
 b.  symptoms of anaemia 
 c.  new-onset abdominal pain 
 d.  symptoms suggestive of small bowel obstruction (with a slow-growing caecal 
cancer) 
 e.  symptoms from involvement of the bladder or female genital tract owing to local 
invasion 
 f.  sacral plexus pain, which is a very late manifestation 
 g.  a positive faecal occult blood test on screening (note: if unexplained iron defi ciency 
is also present it is a particularly worrying result). 
 2.  If colon cancer was identifi ed, ask whether the patient knows what staging tests (e.g. 
CT scans, PET scans) have been done and what treatment has been undertaken. If 
radiotherapy was given to the pelvis, enquire about any ongoing symptoms of proctitis 
or cystitis. 
 3.  Determine whether the patient understands the prognosis and ascertain the social 
support network. Ask whether stoma therapy has been discussed. 
 4.  If the patient has a history of polyps, try to fi nd out from the patient whether these 
were adenomatous, hyperplastic or sessile serrated polyps, and their approximate 
size and number. If they do not know, request information from the medical record. 
Adenomatous polyps may be tubular or villous (or tubulovillous); invasive cancer 
is more likely in larger polyps (10% of those  > 2.5 cm are malignant). If polyps 
were detected, ask the patient whether surveillance colonoscopy has been conducted 
in the past, and if so when this began and how often. Surveillance colonoscopies 
generally occur every 1–5 years (depending on polyp type, number and size, plus 
taking into account other risk factors, such as family history). 
 5.  Th e family history needs to be carefully obtained for any patient with a history of 
polyps or colon cancer. If the patient describes having had hundreds or thousands 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How active is  this patient ’ s inﬂ ammatory bowel disease? 
 2.  What workup would you do before starting on an anti-TNF drug? 
 3.  What is your assessment of  this patient ’ s nutritional state? 
 4.  What are your recommendations for screening for colon cancer for  this patient?

Examination Medicine
of adenomatous polyps throughout the large bowel, then familial adenomatous 
polyposis (FAP) is the diagnosis (until proven otherwise). Th ese polyps usually occur 
after puberty and most individuals are aff ected by the age of 25 years. If the colon 
is not removed, almost all will have colon cancer before the age of 40. In this type 
of clinical case, ask about the presence of any soft-tissue or bony tumours (Gardiner ’ s 
syndrome), or tumours in the central nervous system (Turkot ’ s syndrome), which 
are variants of FAP. 
 Most patients with FAP will have undergone a total colectomy with ileoanal 
anastomosis. Ask about continence and stool frequency if this operation has been 
performed. Screening for duodenal and periampullary cancers every 1–3 years by 
endoscopy is generally recommended. 
 Ask whether any off spring of a patient with this condition have been screened. 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy on an annual basis is recommended (and colonoscopy once 
adenomas start to be detected). DNA testing of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells for the presence of the mutated  APC gene at puberty is also useful (after fi rst 
testing aff ected relatives to validate the presence of the  APC mutation) in screening 
off spring. 
 Th e MuTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) syndrome (autosomal recessive) can 
present just like FAP. 
 If there is a strong family history of colon cancer, consider the possibility of Lynch 
syndrome (see below). Th ere is a 70% lifetime risk of colon cancer in this autosomal 
dominant disease. Th ere is often also a family history of either ovarian or endometrial 
carcinoma. Members of such families are typically screened by colonoscopy every 
1–2 years, beginning at the age of 25 years, as well as undergoing pelvic ultrasonography 
and endometrial biopsies. 
 6.  Enquire about any history of documented infl ammatory bowel disease. Th e risk of 
colorectal cancer in a patient with UC is small during the initial 7–10 years after 
development of pancolonic disease, but then increases approximately 1% per year. 
Ask whether or not colonoscopic surveillance has been undertaken. Patients with 
Crohn ’ s colitis should now also be off ered similar surveillance. 
 7.  Ask whether there has been any history of possible septicaemia or endocarditis (fever, 
malaise, etc.).  Streptococcus bovis ,  Clostridium septicus or  Enterococcus faecalis bacteraemia 
indicates an underlying high risk of occult colon cancer and requires aggressive 
investigation. 
 8.  Hamartomas of the gastrointestinal tract with mucocutaneous pigmentation (Peutz–
Jeghers syndrome) increase the risk of both large and small bowel cancer, as well as 
breast, uterine and ovarian cancers. Aff ected patients should undergo surveillance 
by colonoscopy and gastroscopy every 3 years from 18 years of age. 
 9.  Determine whether there is any history of a ureterosigmoidostomy for correction 
of congenital exstrophy of the bladder, which increases the risk of colon cancer 
15–30 years later. 
 10.  Diabetes mellitus, renal transplant and acromegaly may be associated with an increased 
risk of colorectal malignancy; regular full-dose aspirin use may reduce the risk of 
colon cancer. 
 The examination 
 1.  Look for evidence of jaundice or anaemia. 
 2.  If the patient is currently undergoing 5-fl uorouracil-derived chemotherapy, look at 
the palms and soles for evidence of hand–foot syndrome (very tender, symmetrical 
erythema) ( Fig. 7.8 ).

 3.  Carefully examine the abdomen, in particular looking for any evidence of malignant 
deposits in the liver or other intraperitoneal masses, or skin changes that are consistent 
with radiotherapy. Record any scars on the abdomen ( Fig. 7.9 ). 
 4.  Results of a rectal examination need to be obtained. 
 5.  Other lymph node groups should be examined and evidence of metastatic malignancy 
elsewhere (e.g. the lungs, bones or brain) should be sought.

tion. Many physicians would also order a CT chest / abdomen / pelvis  + /  − MRI pelvis, 
liver function tests and measure the baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. 
If possible, a complete colonoscopy should be undertaken to look for evidence of 
synchronous cancers or polyps. If colonoscopy was not performed before the operation, 
it should be carried out as soon as practicable after the operation. 
 2.  Following a resection, patients are often followed up for 5 years with annual physical 
examinations and surveillance colonoscopy every 1 year after resection, then 3–5-yearly 
depending upon the previous colonoscopy. Measuring CEA levels every 3 months 
for 2 years after surgery for Dukes’ B or C stage disease, as a test for tumour recurrence, 
is often recommended but remains controversial. 
 3.  If metastatic disease is present, resection of the primary colorectal tumour does not 
change prognosis and should be done only for symptomatic reasons. Th e exception 
is limited metastases to the liver only, where 25% may be cured by resection. 
 4.  Determine whether the patient has had radiation therapy to the pelvis, which may 
have been off ered with a rectal cancer. Some patients may have received chemotherapy; 
in particular, patients with Dukes’ C stage have often had adjuvant leucovorin-modulated 
5-fl uorouracil for 6 months. Oxaliplatin may be added. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What would you tell  this patient about his or her prognosis? 
 2.  For which patients would you recommend chemotherapy after bowel resection? 
 3.  When might surgery for metastases be useful?

 2.  Ask about treatment (e.g. dietary supplements, diuretics, beta-blockers, salt or fl uid 
restriction, alcohol or other drug abstinence, steroids, lactulose, neomycin, rifaximin). 
Is the patient a transplant candidate? 
 3.  Ask about complications, such as any history of encephalopathy. An early sign of this 
is reversal of the sleep cycle. Is there any history of portal hypertension (ascites or 
bleeding from varices), or recent abdominal pain (gallstones – usually pigment stones, 
acute alcoholic hepatitis, etc.)? 
 4.  Ask about recent fever, abdominal pain or tenderness, or evidence of altered mental 
status – in the setting of ascites this suggests spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) 
and it is important to start antibiotic treatment as soon as ascitic fl uid, blood and 
urine have been obtained for culture and analysis. Determine whether there have 
been one or more previous episodes of SBP – an indication for long-term prophylactic 
antibiotic therapy. In the setting of cirrhosis, an admission for gastrointestinal (GI) 
bleeding is an indication for short-term antibiotic cover as mortality is reduced. 
 5.  Ask about investigations (e.g. liver biopsy, endoscopy for varices, surveillance 
ultrasound). 
 6.  Ask about operations (e.g. transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), 
transplant). 
 7.  Enquire about erectile dysfunction, loss of libido. 
 8.  Enquire about social problems (e.g. employment, family). 
 The examination 
 1.  Note nutritional status (including obesity) and the patient ’ s racial origin. Hepatitis 
B and C viruses are endemic in South East Asia, Italy and Egypt. Look for tattoos 
– tattoo needles are a source of infection. Examine carefully for the signs of chronic 
liver disease ( Figs 7.11–7.13 ). Also, note any hepatic encephalopathy, signs of portal 
hypertension, including splenomegaly, ascites, oedema and signs of bleeding (e.g. 
melaena). 
 2.  Consider hepatocellular carcinoma (particularly in haemochromatosis, and cirrhosis 
as a result of hepatitis B or C virus infection, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)). 
In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, examine for a hard mass and liver bruit 
(hepatoma). 
 3.  Look for the signs of haemochromatosis (now rare) ( Fig. 7.14 ). In young patients, 
consider Wilson ’ s disease and look carefully for Kayser–Fleischer rings ( Fig. 7.15 ). If 
there is deep jaundice with scratch marks and xanthelasma (see  Fig. 16.3 ,  p. 415 ), 
particularly in a woman, consider end-stage primary biliary cholangitis. 
 4.  Exclude severe right heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation or constrictive pericarditis 
clinically in all patients. Search for other causes and sequelae ( Tables 7.7 and  7.8 ). 
 Investigations 
 Management of cirrhosis depends on the aetiology, morphology and hepatic function. 
It is important to make a diagnosis and exclude potentially reversible causes of further 
liver deterioration.
 1.  Liver function tests: these should be used to confi rm abnormalities, follow progress 
and give an idea of prognosis (particularly a low albumin level and prolonged INR). 
An aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio of  > 
2.0 suggests alcoholic liver disease. 
 2.  Full blood count: this is helpful because anaemia may be caused by chronic disease, 
blood loss, folate defi ciency, bone marrow depression, hypersplenism, haemolysis or 
sideroblastic anaemia. Round macrocytes are common in alcoholics. Remember that

leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occur in hypersplenism. A low platelet count in 
the setting of chronic liver disease suggests portal hypertension. 
 3.  Biochemistry/renal function tests: these are important to exclude the hepatorenal 
syndrome. Hyponatraemia is common in cirrhosis. 
 4.  Ascitic tap ( Tables 7.9 and  7.10 ): rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis if ascites 
is present ( > 250 / mm 3 polymorphs). 
 Table 7.9   Causes of ascites and interpretation of ascitic ﬂ uid studies 
 CAUSES 
 1.  Related to portal hypertension (serum-to-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG)  > 11 g / L):
 a.  Cirrhosis (most important – 97% accurate for portal hypertension) 
 b.  Alcoholic hepatitis 
 c.  Cardiac ascites (right heart failure or constrictive pericarditis) 
 d.  Budd–Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis) or inferior vena caval obstruction (see  Table 7.10 ) 
 2.  Not related to portal hypertension (SAAG  < 11 g / L):
 a.  Peritoneal carcinomatosis 
 b.  Peritoneal tuberculosis 
 c.  Pancreatitis 
 d.  Nephrotic syndrome (see  Table 11.6 ,  p. 315 ) 
 EXAMINATION OF ASCITIC FLUID FOLLOWING A DIAGNOSTIC PARACENTESIS 
 1.  SAAG –  ≥ 11 g / L in portal hypertension (e.g. cirrhosis) 
 2.  Blood – suggests traumatic tap, malignancy or a recent invasive test 
 3.  Turbid or white ﬂ uid – suggests infection or chylous ascites 
 4.  Cell count – 0–300  × 10 6 / L mononuclear cells is normal;  > 500 cells or  > 250 polymorphs  × 10 6 / L 
suggests spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 
 5.  Lactate – increased in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 
 6.  Amylase – elevated in pancreatic ascites 
 7.  Cytology – for malignant cells 
 8.  Culture – for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

 CAUSES 
 1.  Idiopathic (thrombosis or ﬁ brous obliteration of hepatic vein) 
 2.  Myeloproliferative disease, especially polycythaemia rubra vera 
 3.  Malignant disease (e.g. renal, pancreatic, hepatocellular carcinoma, adrenal, testicular, thyroid) 
 4.  Oral contraceptives or pregnancy 
 5.  Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
 6.  Drugs (e.g. azathioprine, adriamycin) 
 7.  Fibrous membrane, trauma, schistosomiasis, amoebiasis 
 DIAGNOSIS 
 1.  Liver function tests – non-speciﬁ c, but serum alkaline phosphatase level may be high 
 2.  Ascitic tap 
 3.  Ultrasonography with Doppler ﬂ ow studies – less sensitive than angiography but diagnostic in  > 85% of 
cases 
 4.  Technetium sulfur colloid liver scan (increased caudate lobe uptake) – less useful 
 5.  Magnetic resonance angiography (and venography) – diagnostic 
 6.  Liver biopsy – highly suggestive (‘nutmeg’ liver)

 5.  Ultrasound or abdominal CT scan ( Fig. 7.16 ): this may help exclude biliary obstruction 
and infi ltration. Th e texture of the liver may suggest infi ltration (e.g. fat) or nodularity 
(cirrhosis). 
 6.  Fibro-scanning: this can be used in place of biopsy to help diagnose cirrhosis. 
 7.  In the setting of dyspnoea, consider  hepatopulmonary syndrome . Platypnoea (dyspnoea 
that is worse when the patient sits up and is relieved by lying down) and orthodexia 
(arterial desaturation when upright) are strongly suggestive; a diagnosis of intrapul-
monary vascular dilatation may be possible by contrast echocardiography. 
 8.  Always assess for possible causative factors (see  Table 7.7 ).
 •  Obtain hepatitis B and C serologies. 
 •  Screen for antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) if primary biliary cholangitis is 
suspected. In suspected chronic hepatitis (e.g. in a young woman with raised 
globulins) test for antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), 
and anti-liver and kidney microsomes type 1 (anti-LKM1) antibody. In type I 
autoimmune chronic hepatitis there is marked hyperglobulinaemia, and ANA and 
SMA are present. In type II, ANA is negative, but anti-LKM1 is present in high 
titre and liver cytosol antigen may be present (this antibody also occurs in low 
titre in hepatitis C). In the rare overlap syndromes, the only serological abnormality 
may be AMA, but the histology shows autoimmune hepatitis, or the patient is 
ANA or SMA (but not AMA) positive and has primary biliary cholangitis (autoim-
mune cholangiopathy) on histology. 
 •  Order iron studies and, in a young patient, serum copper and caeruloplasmin 
levels. Alpha 1 -antitrypsin defi ciency should be considered; absence of the alpha 1 
fraction on a protein electrophoresis is a useful clue. 
 •  Evaluate for evidence of infl ammatory bowel disease if there are colonic symptoms. 
Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCAs) occur in up to 80%

of patients with ulcerative colitis and are a marker for primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(60% of cases). 
 •  Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is recommended for any patient 
with cirrhosis. Screening is now by 6-monthly liver ultrasound. 
 •  Assess the hepatic functional reserve of patients with known or suspected cirrhosis 
(see  Table 7.11 ). 
 9.  Liver biopsy: this is a defi nitive test and probably should be done if the diagnosis is 
uncertain, unless there are specifi c contraindications (e.g. coagulopathy).

 HINT 
 The Child–Pugh score ( Table 7.11 ) can be used as an  aide memoire for the complications 
of chronic liver disease viz. jaundice, coagulopathy, poor nutrition, ascites and 
encephalopathy. 
 Treatment 
 Decide whether the patient has acute or acute-on-chronic disease and whether the disease 
is compensated or decompensated. Management includes treating hepatocellular failure 
(synthetic function) and portal hypertension (plumbing). Cirrhosis is irreversible. However, 
removing causative factors, such as alcohol, iron overload and drugs, or treating viral 
infection is of value. 
 HEPATOCELLULAR FAILURE 
 Acute hepatic encephalopathy can be precipitated by bleeding into the GI tract or 
electrolyte disturbances (e.g. alkalosis increases the ammonia crossing the blood–brain 
barrier, or hypokalaemia, which increases renal ammonia production). Hypokalaemia 
may be caused by recent diuretic use. Infection (e.g. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), 
drugs (e.g. sedatives), a high-protein diet, constipation, deteriorating liver function (e.g. 
alcoholic binge, hepatocellular carcinoma) and rarely metabolic disturbances (e.g. 
hypoglycaemia, hypoxia) may also precipitate encephalopathy. 
 Management 
 1.  Management consists of removing the precipitating factors. Th is can include medications 
and endoscopic treatment to stop bleeding, giving a low-protein high-energy diet, 
 
 
181
7 • The gastrointestinal long case
treating infection, correcting electrolyte disturbances, avoiding sedatives / other 
contributing medications, and the use of lactulose (lowers colonic pH and thus 
ammonia absorption) or rifaximin (thought to decrease the number of ammonia-
producing colonic bacteria), or both. 
 2.  Chronic hepatocellular failure should be managed by treating the cause where 
possible. 
 3.  Control encephalopathy and ascites (e.g. lactulose or rifaximin, salt restriction, diuretics). 
 4.  Watch for gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney disease. 
 5.  In autoimmune chronic hepatitis, steroids help in patients without viral markers. 
 PORTAL HYPERTENSION 
 Clinical features include splenomegaly, the presence of collaterals, ascites and fetor 
hepaticus. Low platelets on the blood count are a clue. Investigations include endoscopy 
for oesophageal varices, ascitic tap and abdominal ultrasound with Doppler arterial and 
venous fl ow studies. 
 Management 
 1.  An attempt should be made to assess the bleeding risk for a patient with varices. 
High-risk patients (75% risk of haemorrhage over 1 year) are those with Child ’ s class 
C cirrhosis, gross ascites and large varices. All patients with large varices should be 
recommended prophylactic treatment – usually with beta-blockers or variceal band 
ligation. 
 2.  Bleeding varices should be managed acutely by replacing intravascular volume (transfuse 
only if the haemoglobin is less than 70 g / L or bleeding is massive) and correcting 
coagulation abnormalities. Intravenous octreotide or terlipressin (triglycyl lysine 
vasopressin), or alternatively vasopressin combined with glyceryl trinitrate, is a fi rst-line 
therapy, but only a temporary measure. Also give antibiotic cover for a maximum of 
7 days (e.g. IV ceftriaxone or oral norfl oxacin). Oesophageal variceal banding therapy 
is eff ective (and superior to sclerotherapy) in stopping acute bleeding. Balloon tamponade 
at the gastro-oesophageal junction with a gastric balloon is rarely required; oesophageal 
balloon tamponade may worsen the prognosis. To prevent recurrent variceal bleeding, 
elective endoscopic banding to obliterate varices may be eff ective. Non-selective 
beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol, carvedilol) can reduce portal pressure and may be 
useful in patients with good liver function. TIPS is preferable to shunt surgery. 
Mortality is high for ‘crash’ portacaval shunts. 
 3.  Treatment of ascites consists of gentle diuresis (maximum weight loss of 500 g per 
day). Begin with salt restriction and spironolactone but increase the dose slowly. If the 
urinary sodium to potassium ratio is  > 1, a dose of 150 mg / day is usually adequate; 
if the ratio is less than 1, higher doses are needed. Frusemide is given if necessary. 
A combination of frusemide 40 mg daily and spironolactone 100 mg daily may be 
the most helpful, although there is evidence that spironolactone alone may be as 
eff ective. Th erapeutic paracentesis is a safe alternative in patients with tense ascites, 
especially when there is also peripheral oedema. Intravenous salt-poor albumin is 
given to replace the protein lost in ascitic fl uid and 5–10 L can be removed; the 
procedure can be repeated as necessary. Th erapeutic paracentesis is contraindicated 
in renal failure or severe coagulopathy. Th ese patients are at risk of spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis. Antibiotic treatment (e.g. ceftriaxone) is indicated if SBP is 
suspected (advanced cirrhotic patient presenting with fever, abdominal tenderness 
or encephalopathy) or the ascitic fl uid has a polymorph cell count  > 250 / mm 3 . 
Usually there is a dramatic clinical response (within 5 days); otherwise repeat the

Examination Medicine
paracentesis. Lifelong antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. norfl oxacin) is subsequently required 
unless the liver is transplanted. SBP is associated with a poor 6-month survival. 
Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis is also indicated in an upper GI bleeder with 
cirrhosis. 
 4.  In resistant ascites, an alternative to regular paracentesis is TIPS. Remember, though, 
that this is contraindicated in encephalopathic patients. 
 5.  Nutrition is important for these decompensated patients. Nasogastric feeding has 
been shown to be helpful if oral intake is inadequate. 
 6.  Liver transplantation is the defi nitive treatment in suitable patients. 
 RENAL DISEASE AND CIRRHOSIS 
 Renal impairment in cirrhosis is not always due to hepatorenal syndrome, and fi rst you 
must look for and cease any nephrotoxic drugs if possible (especially NSAIDs and diuretics), 
exclude infection (e.g. SBP), ensure hypovolaemia is identifi ed and corrected, and consider 
other causes of renal disease (e.g. hepatitis C or B glomerulonephritis – look for proteinuria, 
casts, etc.). 
 Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) occurs in those with advanced chronic liver disease or 
liver failure and can be acute and rapidly progressive (type I) or subacute (type II). It 
is associated with high mortality rates. Th e diagnosis of HRS is based on excluding the 
risk factors above and lack of improvement over 48 hours during volume expansion 
with albumin. Diuretics should have been stopped. If the diagnosis of HRS is made, 
albumin plus a vasoconstrictor is utilised (a vasopressin analogue, e.g. terlipressin, or 
alpha-adrenergic agonist, e.g. noradrenaline), and listing for transplant should be 
considered. Without transplant, HRS is often a preterminal event. 
 HEPATITIS B 
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) may be transmitted parenterally (intravenous drug users, 
infected blood products, etc.) or sexually. Intermediate to high prevalence populations 
include New Zealand M ā oris and people from South East Asia, the Middle East and 
Western Africa. Most infected adult individuals seroconvert and develop immunity; 
however, a small proportion become chronic carriers or progress to chronic hepatitis 
and ultimately cirrhosis. Children younger than 6 years who are acutely infected also 
have high rates of chronic infection. Th e risk of developing HCC in HBV cirrhosis 
is high. 
 Th e diagnosis of hepatitis B is made by positive serology (hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg) positive) and active disease is usually associated with the hepatitis B e-antigen 
(HBeAg)-positive state, as well as elevated serum transaminase levels, particularly the 
serum ALT level ( Table 7.12 ). 
 Measuring for HBV DNA provides a more accurate assessment of viral load. Precore 
mutants of HBV are usually diagnosed in patients who are HBeAg negative and HBeAb 
positive, but have elevated transaminase and HBV DNA levels. 
 Th e most accurate method of staging the disease is by means of a liver biopsy. Th e 
liver biopsy is important to assess the extent of the infl ammation and fi brosis in those 
with chronic hepatitis. However, fi broscanning is increasingly used as a non-invasive 
method of assessing fi brosis. 
 Management 
 1.  Th e aim of antiviral therapy is to stop viral replication (i.e. seroconversion from 
positive HBsAg and HBeAg to negative HBsAg and HBeAg, and lower HBV DNA 
levels), as well as to normalise ALT levels and histology. Loss of HBsAg is ideal

(a functional cure), but current therapy is ineff ective with regards this endpoint. 
Th ose with elevated ALT levels and high levels of HBV DNA should be treated, as 
well as those with cirrhosis regardless of their serology. ‘Inactive carriers’ (normal 
transaminases, HBV DNA  < 10 5 copies / mL and normal biopsy) usually do not require 
antiviral therapy unless undergoing, for example, bone marrow transplant for another 
indication. 
 2.  Treatment options include peginterferon or nucleoside / nucleotide analogues (e.g. 
entecavir, tenofovir). Peginterferon can be considered in those with well-compensated 
disease who do not want long-term treatment (treatment is limited to 48 weeks), but 
has many side-eff ects. Entecavir and tenofovir are the preferred nucleoside / nucleotide 
analogues and are well tolerated, with low rates of resistance. Treatment is usually 5 
years to lifelong. Lamivudine is not recommended owing to high rates of drug 
resistance. 
 3.  Liver transplantation can be considered in patients with decompensated HBV liver 
disease, but without proper preparation HBV infection recurs in the transplanted 
liver and may cause very aggressive liver disease. Fortunately, strategies are available 
to overcome this problem. Currently, antiviral drugs are used prior to transplantation 
to lower HBV-DNA levels and then large doses of hepatitis B immunoglobulin are 
used in the peritransplantation period. Th is strategy is extremely eff ective in preventing 
recurrence after liver transplantation. 
 HEPATITIS C 
 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is predominantly parenterally transmitted and is particularly 
common in intravenous drug users. Th e virus is also commonly found in migrants from 
endemic regions, including South East Asia, Egypt and Italy. Th e majority of patients 
are incidentally found to be infected and are usually asymptomatic, although fatigue is 
a common symptom. If the patient is HCV antibody positive, confi rm the diagnosis 
with HCV RNA. 
 Extrahepatic manifestations are listed in  Table 7.13 . Th e disease process is insidious 
in onset. Approximately 80% of infected individuals go on to develop chronic hepatitis 
over a 20-year period. It is estimated that 20%–30% of patients with chronic hepatitis 
C eventually develop cirrhosis. Once cirrhosis develops, symptoms are more common 
and the signs of end-stage liver disease can appear, with jaundice, weakness, wasting

cirrhosis develop HCC. 
 Diagnosis is based on a positive HCV antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) test and then the active virus is checked with HCV-polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) testing. 
 Quantitative HCV-PCR is useful in monitoring the response to treatment. A liver 
biopsy is helpful to stage the disease and estimate the extent of fi brosis, although the 
non-invasive fi broscan is replacing liver biopsy in practice.

 Management 
 1.  Management needs to take a holistic approach ( Table 7.14 ). Curative therapy is now 
available for hepatitis C with a number of pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral agent 
regimens, and achieves a high, sustained virological response (cure) rates in over 90% 
of patients. 
 2.  Patients who develop end-stage liver disease may be transplant candidates. 
 Screen for hepatocellular carcinoma 
 Surveillance for HCC (hepatoma) is necessary if there is cirrhosis from any cause, and 
especially hepatitis C or B. 
 It is recommended that patients have an ultrasound every 6 months; alpha-fetoprotein 
can also be requested (in addition to ultrasound) – the combination increases detection 
rates but also false-positive rates. Small tumours can be resected if the patient does not have 
signifi cant portal hypertension. Otherwise transplant is sometimes possible (if advanced 
liver disease with a solitary tumour  ≤ 5 cm, or up to three tumours all  ≤ 3 cm) and can 
be curative. Palliative approaches (or as a bridge to transplant) include radiofrequency or 
microwave ablation (RFA / MWA), transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and stereotactic 
body radiation therapy (SBRT). Th ose with advanced disease (including advanced cirrhosis) 
can be off ered systemic therapies, such as sorafenib, regorafenib or lenvatinib (multitargeted 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors), which modestly improve survival. 
 HAEMOCHROMATOSIS 
 Th is is an autosomal recessive disease marked by increased intestinal absorption of iron 
and progressive iron loading of parenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, heart and other 
organs. Th e diagnosis is now most often made before symptoms develop (from routine 
iron studies or genetic testing of relatives of aff ected patients) and is much commoner 
in men (menses protect women). Classic symptoms, when present, include fatigue / lethargy, 
skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, arthralgia / arthropathy (especially hands) 
and impotence. Th e classic triad of cirrhosis with skin hyperpigmentation and diabetes 
(‘bronzed diabetes’ (see  Fig. 7.14 )) is a late manifestation of the disease. HCC occurs 
in up to 30% of patients with cirrhosis. 
 Hereditary haemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder in Caucasians, with a 
prevalence of at least 1 in 250. Diagnosis is suggested by an increased transferrin saturation 
( ≥ 45%) and a raised ferritin level ( > 300  μ g / L in men and  > 200  μ g / L in premenopausal 
women is suggestive). Th e serum ferritin level is an acute-phase reactant and may be 
elevated in other chronic infl ammatory conditions, notably those involving the liver, 
including NASH, alcoholic liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis. 
 Diagnosis is made by identifying the genetic defects. In diffi  cult cases, liver biopsy 
is useful to measure the amount of iron overload and the extent of liver disease (fi brosis, 
cirrhosis, etc.). A liver biopsy is also indicated if the ferritin is over 1000  μ g / L, or liver 
enzymes are elevated. Th ere are specifi c features on biopsy: a Perls ’ Prussian blue stain 
visually demonstrates the extent of iron overload. It is important to determine the 
hepatic iron concentration and index (usually  > 1.9) on liver biopsy specimens. 
 Th e genetic defect has been localised to the short arm of chromosome 6. Th e gene 
has been termed  HFE . Two common mutations have been described:  C282Y and  H63D . 
Patients with phenotypic haemochromatosis are usually homozygous for the  C282Y 
mutation; very few are compound heterozygotes ( C282Y and  H63D mutation). Homozy-
gotes for  H63D may not be at risk; 5% of those with haemochromatosis have none of 
these mutations. Genetic testing is recommended for all fi rst-degree relatives of the 
proband. In those cases homozygous for  C282Y , there is a one in four chance of the

 Table 7.14   Principles of management of hepatitis C virus 
 GENERAL 
 • 
 Rule out coexistent HIV and hepatitis B. Newly diagnosed patients should be tested for hepatitis A and 
B antibodies – if negative, vaccinate. 
 • 
 Counsel about the routes of HCV transmission – do not donate blood; ensure wounds are covered and 
blood-contaminated surfaces are cleaned with diluted household bleach; avoid sharing toothbrushes, 
razors or needles; note the risk of sexual transmission is low. 
 • 
 There should be a discussion about pregnancy. The rates of vertical transmission are approximately 
5%, and currently there are few data about the safety of the oral antivirals in pregnancy. 
 • 
 Screen and counsel for depression (depression is relevant to interferon-based therapies). 
 • 
 Manage alcohol, obesity, cigarette smoking and marijuana exposure (can promote hepatic ﬁ brosis), 
and recommend ceasing all illicit drugs (none of these are now a contraindication to antiviral therapy). 
 • 
 Review hepatotoxic drugs – avoid NSAIDs in advanced liver disease, remember the dose of 
paracetamol should not exceed 2 g per 24 hours (and know that the use of statins is safe for patients 
with stable HCV infection). 
 • 
 Coffee consumption (more than two cups per day) may be beneﬁ cial (but is not an established 
recommendation). 
 • 
 If cirrhosis is present – manage as previously discussed in this chapter. 
 ANTIVIRAL THERAPY 
 • 
 After acute infection, up to 80% of HCV patients become chronically infected. If HCV is chronic (i.e. 
detectable HCV viral level at 6 months), consider therapy. 
 • 
 With the advent of oral antiviral therapy, the use of peginterferon / ribavirin has almost become 
obsolete. Cure / SVR is attained in up to 95% of patients. The oral drug combinations tend to be well 
tolerated. Optimal treatment regimens depend on genotype, drug availability (know current drug 
availability), any prior exposure to HCV antivirals and the presence of cirrhosis. 
 • 
 Glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinaemia and porphyria cutanea tarda may respond to antiviral therapy. 
In those with HCV and severe vasculitis, consider additional therapy (e.g. plasmapheresis; remember 
drug interactions with HCV regimens). 
 • 
 Before beginning treatment in any patient – assess renal function, order a full blood count and 
differential, and liver function tests. 
 • 
 Assess for any severe co-morbidity (e.g. cardiac disease). 
 • 
 Assess disease stage – review non-invasive markers of liver ﬁ brosis (AST / ALT ratio, AST to platelet ratio 
index (APRI)), and the ultrasound-based transient elastography (do not routinely ask for a liver biopsy). 
 • 
 With non-interferon-based therapies, generally sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment 
should be assessed by measuring the viral load at 12 weeks after stopping therapy. 
 • 
 Assess safety and potential drug interactions if planning to start anti-viral therapy. 
 SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF INTERFERON-FREE ANTIVIRAL OPTIONS 
 Pan-genotypic (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 
 • 
 Sofosbuvir  + velpatasvir – 12 week treatment regimen for non-cirrhotics and cirrhotics (the addition of 
ribavirin can be considered for those with compensated cirrhosis and HCV genotype 3). Nausea is a 
common side-effect. Sofosbuvir is not recommended if eGFR is  < 30 mL / min / 1.73 m 2 . 
 • 
 Glecaprevir  + pibrentasvir – 8-week treatment regimen for non-cirrhotics, 12–16 for those with cirrhosis. 
Headache, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea and an unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia are reported side-effects. 
 • 
 Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir – genotype 1 (can also be used for 4, 5, 6); 8–12-week treatment regimen for 
non-cirrhotics, 12–24 weeks for cirrhotics. Ribavirin may be added in certain circumstances. Nausea is 
a common side-effect. Sofosbuvir is not recommended if eGFR is  < 30 mL / min / 1.73 m 2 . 
 • 
 Elbasvir-grazoprevir – genotype 1 and 4; 12-week treatment regimen for both non-cirrhotics and 
cirrhotics. Headache is commonly reported, and can cause an increase in ALT and bilirubin. 
 • 
 Daclatasvir  + sofosbuvir – genotype 1 or 3; 12–24-week treatment regimen, ribavirin may be added for 
those with cirrhosis. Fatigue, headache, insomnia, nausea and diarrhoea are reported side-effects. 
 • 
 Daily ﬁ xed-dose combination of glecaprevir (300 mg) / pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 8 weeks (or 12 weeks 
if cirrhosis present) and sofosbuvir (400 mg) / velpatasvir (100 mg) for 12 weeks are other alternatives.

siblings being homozygous. Th e children ’ s chance of developing haemochromatosis 
depends on the other parent (homozygous normal indicates no risk). 
 Management 
 1.  Phlebotomy is indicated if the patient is a  C282Y homozygote or  C282Y /  H63D 
compound heterozygote and has raised ferritin ( > 200  μ g / L in females,  > 300  μ g / L 
in males; some guidelines suggest phlebotomy only if  > 500  μ g / L in asymptomatic 
individuals), or if symptomatic or cirrhotic. 
 2.  Treatment is through regular venesection (once to twice weekly, may be decreased to 
monthly if elderly or frail) until ferritin is 20–50  μ g / L (also aiming to maintain Hb 
 > 120 g / L) – this may take up to 2 years. Maintenance phlebotomy regimens (targeting 
ferritin 50–100  μ g / L) may be once every 3–6 months. Fifty units of blood removed 
per year equals about 12.5 g of iron withdrawn. However, patients with iron overload 
as a result of mutations of the iron export protein ferroportin may not tolerate this 
rate of removal. 
 3.  Th e avoidance of alcohol is important. 
 4.  Manifestations that respond to phlebotomy include malaise, fatigue, skin hyperpig-
mentation, insulin requirements and abdominal pain. Less responsive are arthropathy, 
hypogonadism and advanced cirrhosis. 
 5.  Hepatocellular carcinoma is  not prevented by venesection in patients with established 
cirrhosis, but life expectancy is normal in those without end-organ damage whose 
iron stores are reduced. 
 NON-ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS (NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE) 
 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is divided into non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFL patients have hepatic steatosis without 
infl ammation, whereas NASH patients have associated infl ammation. A proportion of 
patients with NASH will progress to cirrhosis. NASH is defi ned by histological features, 
resembling those of alcoholic hepatitis, which are present in patients who have not 
consumed excessive quantities of alcohol. Th e majority of patients present because they 
are inadvertently found to have abnormal liver function tests or steatosis detected on 
imaging. Even though clinical fi ndings are uncommon, hepatomegaly is the most frequent 
sign detected. Th e typical liver function abnormalities are a two- to threefold elevation 
of the serum aminotransferase levels, with the serum ALT greater than the serum AST 
level (the opposite of alcoholic liver disease). Th e serum alkaline phosphatase and 
gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels may be similarly elevated. Viral markers are 
absent. 
 NASH is more common in women and the most frequently associated underlying 
clinical conditions are obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
and hyperlipidaemia, particularly hypertriglyceridaemia. Look for evidence of the metabolic 
syndrome (including hypertension, increased waist circumference and high lipids). 
Nevertheless, studies have documented lean Asian men with NASH. Although the peak 
age of presentation is the fi fth and sixth decades of life, NASH is now the most common 
cause of liver disease in adolescents. 
 Exclude drug causes such as use of steroids, tamoxifen and amiodarone. Th e defi ni-
tive diagnostic test is a liver biopsy but it is  not usually required. Other liver disease 
must be excluded by a liver screen (e.g. haemochromatosis, chronic viral hepatitis) 
( Table 7.15 ). Th e typical histological features are macrovesicular steatosis with an associated 
necroinfl ammatory infi ltrate (usually mononuclear) and a variable degree of fi brosis. 
 Studies have documented elevations in both cardiovascular and hepatic mortality. 
 
 
189
7 • The gastrointestinal long case
 Management 
 Management options are limited to treating the underlying clinical condition, with 
slow weight loss and exercise recommended for obese patients and strict control of 
hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia. Statin therapy is safe for patients with hypercholes-
terolaemia. Bariatric surgery can be considered. Alcohol should be avoided. Vaccination 
and modifi cation of cardiovascular risk factors should occur. Vitamin E supplementation 
can be considered in the absence of diabetes and if there is fi brosis. Pioglitazone can 
be considered in type 2 diabetics. If cirrhosis is present, this should be managed as 
previously outlined.

 4.  You have said  this patient has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. What other causes 
of liver disease would you recommend be excluded? 
 Liver transplantation 
 Liver transplantation is now an important therapeutic option in patients with irreversible, 
progressive liver disease for which there is no acceptable alternative therapy and no 
absolute contraindication. Th e 1-year survival rate overall is 75%. In the examination 
setting, a patient will either have chronic liver disease and be a candidate for transplantation 
or be a transplant recipient who has a problem. 
 The history 
 1.  Obtain details of the patient ’ s liver disease, including diagnosis and duration. Candidates 
for liver transplantation include patients with cirrhosis (MELD  > 12) (complicated 
by, for example, portal hypertension, HRS or HCC), primary sclerosing cholangitis, 
autoimmune chronic hepatitis, chronic portal–systemic encephalopathy, Budd–Chiari 
syndrome, inherited metabolic diseases (e.g. Wilson ’ s disease, alpha 1 -antitrypsin 
defi ciency), highly selected patients with cholangiocarcinoma, and acute or subacute 
hepatic failure refractory ascites or encephalopathy. 
 2.  Th e timing of the transplantation is crucial. Th is should be considered when the 
patient is in end stage but before complications have occurred that may preclude 
proceeding (e.g. preterminal variceal bleeding, irreversible hepatorenal syndrome,

 c.  Infections occur in most patients, largely related to immunosuppression. Th ose 
that occur in the fi rst month tend to be similar to those in immunocompetent 
patients (e.g. line-related infections). From 1 to 6 months post-transplant, oppor-
tunistic infections can be seen (e.g.  Pneumocystis jirovecii , CMV, fungal). Th e 
patient may know the donor and recipient CMV status. Beyond 6 months, if there 
is good graft function, infections tend to be community acquired. However, if 
there is poor graft function, or high levels of immunosuppression, opportunistic 
infections remain a consideration. Ask about prophylactic antibiotic therapy. 
 d.  Biliary strictures may also occur from 4 weeks after transplantation. 
 e.  Acute liver rejection is rarely seen after the initial 6 months. Chronic rejection 
usually occurs 6 weeks to 9 months after transplantation; there is progressive 
cholestasis and diagnosis is best made by liver biopsy. Bone disease and ectopic 
calcifi cation may occur some months after transplantation. 
 7.  Ask about current medications and related complications with their use.
 a.  Cyclosporin or tacrolimus may induce:
 •  cholestasis (dose-dependent) 
 •  hypertension 
 •  nephrotoxicity 
 •  gum hypertrophy 
 •  seizures (controlled by phenytoin, which induces cyclosporin metabolism) 
 •  CNS eff ects, including tremor and central pontine myelinolysis. Patients with 
a low serum cholesterol level are at increased risk of central nervous system 
toxicity. 
 b.  Steroids in high doses may induce a number of problems, including aseptic necrosis 
of long bones, cataracts and psychosis. Enquire about drug adherence. 
 c.  Mycophenolate may cause bone marrow suppression or GI side-eff ects. 
 8.  Try to fi nd out tactfully whether there have been any concerns about malignancy. 
Th e incidence of skin cancers and lymphomas (especially in the CNS) is increased 
with immunosuppression. 
 The examination 
 1.  Th e pre-transplant patient should be examined for signs of chronic liver disease and 
complications of liver disease. Note clubbing (which occurs in cirrhosis and might 
indicate hepatopulmonary syndrome in this setting). 
 2.  Th e post-transplant patient should be examined for liver tenderness (e.g. acute rejection) 
and jaundice (e.g. vanishing bile ducts in chronic rejection, biliary stricture). Examine 
the chest for infection and the mouth for candidiasis. Th e temperature must be taken 
( Table 7.16 ). Examine the central nervous system (e.g. cyclosporin toxicity or cerebral 
infarction from perioperative hypotension or air embolism). Tap the spine for tenderness 
(e.g. vertebral collapse). Take the blood pressure (hypertension may occur at any time 
after transplantation; it is often caused by cyclosporin). 
 Investigations 
 Pre-transplant patients need tests to confi rm the diagnosis, determine current liver 
synthetic function (e.g. serum albumin, INR) and rule out contraindications. Ultrasound 
 
 
192
Examination Medicine
and CT scanning are routine. In patients with possible or defi nite malignancy, metastases 
must be sought. Assess bone density; osteopenia is common in liver disease and increases 
following transplant. Cardiopulmonary and psychiatric evaluations are important. 
 Management 
 Routine outpatient monitoring after transplantation should include a full blood count, 
electrolyte levels, renal and liver profi le, and drug levels (e.g. trough cyclosporin / tacrolimus 
levels). Remember drug interactions with cyclosporin. Diabetes mellitus may supervene 
as a result of treatment with tacrolimus or steroids. Hypertension should be treated. 
Diseases that can recur in the graft include hepatitis B and C, Budd–Chiari syndrome, 
primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis, 
amongst others.

 7.  List all drugs that have been taken, for example:
 a.  Methyldopa, penicillin and quinidine can cause warm antibody immunohaemolytic 
anaemia (WAIHA). 
 b.  Antimalarials, sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin cause haemolysis in subjects defi cient 
in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). 
 Note: Between 10% and 20% of people taking methyldopa have a positive 
direct Coombs’ test, but only a small minority of these develop haemolysis. Th e 
drug alters Rh antigens so that antibodies are produced against them, which 
then cross-react with normal Rh antigens. Th e indirect Coombs’ test is therefore 
positive, even when the drug is not added to the test. Th e other drugs produce an 
indirect Coombs’ test result only when the drug is added to the mixture, because 
in that case the antibodies are directed against a combination of drug and cell 
membrane. 
 c.  Fludarabine, which is often increasingly used as fi rst-line treatment of chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia in patients under the age of 65 and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 
may cause exacerbation of warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA). When 
fl udarabine is combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal rituximab, as is current 
practice, AIHA is mitigated. 
 8.  Enquire about any operations, particularly mechanical heart valve replacement (10% 
of those with aortic valve prostheses have signifi cant haemolysis; this percentage 
is lower with mitral valve prostheses unless a paravalvular leak is present, as the 
pressure gradient is lower). Severe haemolysis in these patients suggests a paravalvular 
leak. 
 9.  Consider the other occasional cause of haemolysis within the circulation – external 
trauma, such as occurs in joggers who wear thin-soled shoes, and the traditional 
group, bongo drummers. In these cases, haemolysis is intravascular and haemosid-
erinuria is characteristic. 
 10.  Determine the patient ’ s ethnic background (e.g. Greeks or Italians may inherit the 
beta-thalassaemia trait; both thalassaemias are common on the subcontinent and 
alpha-thalassaemia is common in China and South East Asia; males of African, 
Mediterranean or Asian descent may have G6PD defi ciency). 
 11.  Th e patient may have an underlying medical problem associated with the risk of 
developing microvascular fragmentation of red cells. Th ese conditions include: dis-
seminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is usually caused by vessel wall 
changes related to an underlying disease, such as disseminated malignancy, renal 
graft rejection or malignant hypertension; TTP, which is of unknown aetiology; and 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS, with similar features to TTP), which can 
follow gastroenteritis caused by  E. coli 0157:H7 infection (do not treat these cases 
with an antibiotic, as this increases the risk of HUS!). 
 
 
195
8 • The haematological long case
 The examination 
 1.  A careful haemopoietic system examination is required. Th e characteristic ‘chipmunk’ 
facies in a young person with thalassaemia is caused by maxillary marrow hyperplasia 
and frontal bossing. 
 2.  Look for pallor and icterus. 
 3.  Examine the heart for a valve prosthesis or severe aortic stenosis (traumatic haemolysis). 
Profound anaemia may be associated with high-output cardiac failure. An iron 
overload state in thalassaemia major from repeated transfusions may cause skin 
pigmentation, cardiac failure and hepatomegaly. 
 4.  Carefully palpate for the spleen; splenomegaly from any cause (see  Table 16.21 , 
 p. 463 ) may result in haemolysis. Lymphadenopathy may indicate lymphoma (associ-
ated with warm or cold antibody haemolysis), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or, 
in practice, glandular fever (cold agglutinin haemolysis). 
 5.  Signs of chronic liver disease should be noted – in severe cirrhosis, spur cell (acan-
thocyte) anaemia is occasionally observed. 
 6.  Examine for focal neurological signs. Look in the fundi – retinal detachment, retinal 
infarcts and vitreous haemorrhages can be manifestations of sickle cell anaemia; 
Kayser–Fleischer rings (see  Fig. 7.15 ,  p. 177 ) may be present in the cornea when 
haemolysis is caused by Wilson ’ s disease. 
 7.  Joint swelling and tenderness, and occasionally aseptic necrosis of bone (e.g. neck 
of femur), also occur in sickle cell anaemia; bony infarcts may become infected (e.g. 
 Salmonella osteomyelitis). 
 8.  Look for leg ulceration. Note any signs of connective tissue disease. 
 9.  Test the urine – urobilinogen may be present with haemolysis; it may be dark from 
the presence of free haemoglobin as a result of intravascular haemolysis and the 
sediment may be abnormal (e.g. TTP). 
 10.  Fever may occur with septicaemia or malaria-associated haemolysis, with acute crises 
in sickle cell anaemia and in TTP. 
 Investigations 
 It is important to confi rm that haemolysis is present, exclude intravascular haemolysis 
and perform tests to determine the aetiology. Th e history and physical examination may 
have provided hints about the likely aetiology.
 1.  Ask for the results of a:
 •  blood count 
 •  reticulocyte count 
 •  serum bilirubin 
 •  lactate dehydrogenase. 
 Haemolysis is likely to be present if there is a normochromic normocytic anaemia 
with an increased reticulocyte count (but reticulocytosis also occurs with blood loss 
or partially treated anaemia) and release of red blood cell components (increased 
unconjugated bilirubin and, more variably, lactate dehydrogenase). 
 2.  Usually serum haptoglobin is absent and haemosiderin is present in the urine. 
Intravascular haemolysis is documented by the presence of methaemalbumin in the 
plasma and, less often, of haemoglobin in the urine. 
 3.  Th e presence of fragmented red cells (schistocytes) suggests valve haemolysis, DIC 
and TTP (or HUS). TTP (or HUS) is very likely when fragmented red cells occur 
in association with thrombocytopenia and normal coagulation studies. Test for renal 
and neurological impairment.

 COMMENT 
The patient has severe normochromic anaemia with marked reticulocytosis. The very high reticulocyte 
count suggests haemolysis rather than blood loss. The polychromasia, nucleated red cells and 
reticulocytosis are signs of increased marrow erythroid activity. The raised bilirubin and reduced 
haptoglobin levels are consistent with haemolysis. The classical triad suggesting haemolysis is a raised 
LDH level, reduced haptoglobin level and unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. The presence of spherocytes 
suggests hereditary spherocytosis or immune haemolysis. If there were fragmented red cells, mechanical 
haemolysis or microangiopathic haemolysis would be likely. Normal red cell morphology would suggest 
hypersplenism or paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. The presence of ‘bite’ cells would suggest G6PD 
deﬁ ciency. 
 In this case the candidate should ask for a Coombs’ test to distinguish autoimmune haemolytic 
anaemia from hereditary spherocytosis.
 4.  Th e blood fi lm usually shows polychromasia; it may show other red cell changes 
( Tables 8.1 and  8.2 ). In thalassaemia, the anaemia is often hypochromic and always 
signifi cantly microcytic. 
 5.  If a congenital intracorpuscular defect seems unlikely, ask for a Coombs’ test to determine 
whether the anaemia is immunohaemolytic. Th e polyspecifi c direct Coombs’ test measures 
the ability of anti-IgG and anti-C3 to agglutinate the patient ’ s red blood cells. Warm 
antibodies (80% of cases) react at body temperature and may occur with lymphoma (usually 
non-Hodgkin), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, solid tumours (lung, colon, kidney and 
ovary), SLE and drugs, or may be idiopathic. Th ey are usually IgG antibodies directed 
at the Rh antigens. Cold-reactive antibodies (cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia – 
CAIHA) are precipitated by exposure to room temperature (‘cold’) – cold agglutinin 
disease (IgM antibodies) may occur acutely with Epstein–Barr infection, glandular fever, 
mycoplasma infection or hepatitis C, and chronically may be caused by lymphoma or 
may be idiopathic; paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (IgG antibodies) is rare.

 6.  If the haemoglobinuria usually occurs at night and there is pancytopenia and venous 
thrombosis, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) should be strongly suspected 
(an acquired stem cell disease secondary to a defective  PIG-A gene). Th e disease may also be 
associated with aplastic anaemia, in which the neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score is low 
(but this test is now rarely performed). Th e most reliable test is analysis by fl ow cytometry 
for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins (e.g. CD55 or decay-accelerating 
factors (DAFs) on the red cell surface, and CD59 or homologous restriction factor). PNH, 
which is an acquired clonal disease, is a result of a mutation that causes faulty or absent 
production of the GPI anchor molecule. Various linked proteins are missing from the red 
cell surface and, as a result, the cells are not protected from lysis by complement. 
 Tests for other causes of haemolysis are presented in  Table 8.2 .

8 • The haematological long case
 Treatment 
 Th is depends on the underlying disease process, which should be reversed if possible 
(e.g. drug withdrawal, treatment of transplant rejection, adoption of another sport or 
musical instrument) (see  Table 8.2 ).
 1.  a. Steroids are useful in immunohaemolytic anaemia caused by warm-reactive antibodies. 
Th e usual approach is to commence at a starting dose of 1 mg / kg / day of pred-
nisolone. Th e haemoglobin level will usually rise within the fi rst week. Concurrent 
use of folate is often recommended. Once a normal haemoglobin level has been 
achieved, the steroid dose must be tapered slowly. Th ere is an 80% early remission 
rate, but only 20% of patients achieve long-term remission with steroids.
 b.  Splenectomy works as well as steroids, and is indicated in poorly responsive or 
resistant disease. 
 c.  Immunosuppressive treatment is reserved for those who do not respond to steroids 
and splenectomy. Azathioprine and cyclophosphamide have each been used with 
some benefi t. Response takes 2–3 months. 
 d.  Normal human immunoglobulin is often eff ective. 
 e.  Th ere is increasing evidence of the effi  cacy of rituximab in very refractory cases, 
but AIHA remains an ‘off -label’ indication. 
 2.  Transfusion is not usually indicated unless there is symptomatic anaemia with a 
haemoglobin level  < 80 g / L as it may exacerbate haemolysis. Th e antibody in 
immunohaemolytic anaemia is likely to react with all normal donor cells so that 
standard cross-matching is not possible. 
 Laboratory testing in such cases most often reveals a ‘pan agglutinin’ autoantibody. 
Occasionally the autoantibody has Rh antigen specifi city and donor red cells lacking 
the antigen can be safely transfused under close observation. 
 3.  When cold-reactive antibodies are responsible, steroid treatment is less eff ective. 
Avoidance of cold can be helpful. Th e disease tends to progress unless the underlying 
cause can be treated. 
 4.  Th e chimeric antibody, rituximab, which attaches to the CD20-binding site on B 
lymphocytes and induces their destruction, may be useful in severe cases of resistant 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. 
 5.  Th e acute haemolytic episodes of patients with G6PD defi ciency are self-limiting 
(only older red blood cells are aff ected) and require no specifi c treatment. Hydration 
should be maintained to protect renal function. Patients should be warned to avoid 
precipitating factors (e.g. broad beans, antimalarials and sulfonamides). 
 6.  Valve haemolysis may be improved by iron supplements and an increase in haemoglobin 
(reduced cardiac output). Paravalvular leaks often need to be repaired and occasionally 
the prosthetic valve may have to be replaced with a larger one. 
 7.  TTP is usually treated with plasmapheresis; early treatment improves the mortality 
rate from almost 100% to 10%. Twice-daily treatment is combined at fi rst with 
high-dose steroids. Even severe neurological defi cit, including coma, may be reversible. 
Immunosuppression may be required in cases with autoimmune aetiology. Antiplatelet 
drugs are of uncertain benefi t. Rituximab may be used early as immunosuppression, 
with cyclophosphamide and vincristine used when refractory. Relapses (10%) can 
usually be treated successfully. Platelet transfusions must be avoided as they exacerbate 
thrombosis. 
 8.  Splenectomy is virtually curative for patients with hereditary spherocytosis and 
elliptocytosis (only 10% have severe haemolysis), and may be useful in selected patients 
with massive splenomegaly, immunohaemolytic anaemia, certain haemoglobinopathies 
and enzymopathies. All patients undergoing splenectomy should receive pneumococcal 
 
 
200
Examination Medicine
 Table 8.3   Treatment advice for patients having a splenectomy 
 1.  Vaccinate for pneumococcus,  Haemophilus inﬂ uenzae type B, group C meningococcus and inﬂ uenza 
2–3 weeks before splenectomy if possible. Booster doses every 5 years (annually for ‘ﬂ u’). 
 2.  Consider continuous prophylactic penicillin V 250 mg BD. 
 3.  Patients should wear an alert bracelet. Overwhelming sepsis may present as obtundation and 
antibiotics should be given immediately. 
 4.  Animal bites should be treated aggressively with local disinfection and systemic antibiotics. 
 5.  Patients with possible septicaemia should have antibiotics to cover encapsulated organisms 
(pneumococcus, meningococcus and  H. inﬂ uenzae ). 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What tests are likely to help you most in investigating  this patient ’ s anaemia? 
 2.  How would you manage  this patient ’ s forthcoming splenectomy? 
vaccine preoperatively if possible. Sometimes, prophylactic treatment with penicillin 
is recommended for 2 years following splenectomy ( Table 8.3 ). Failure of splenectomy 
to control haemolysis may be caused by an accessory spleen (which can be detected 
by a liver–spleen scan). 
 9.  PNH can be treated with washed red cell transfusions and steroids.
 a.  Heparin and warfarin should be used for thrombotic episodes. 
 b.  Bone marrow transplant may be curative. 
 c.  Trials of the monoclonal antibody eculizimab, which blocks the complement cascade 
below C5, have shown major benefi ts, with a reduction in transfusion requirements 
and reduced incidence of thrombosis; the drug prevents the complement-driven 
haemolysis in PNH. Th e Commonwealth Department of Health has a specifi c 
eculizimab access program for Australian patients. 
 Thrombophilia 
 Th e discovery of new thrombophilic factors has made the patient with recurrent or even 
a single thrombotic episode a very suitable long case. Suspect this possibility if the 
patient is under 50 or has a family history of recurrent thromboses ( Table 8.4 ). Apart 
from those with homozygous Factor V Leiden or antithrombin defi ciency, most patients 
with these conditions will never have a thrombotic event unless there is an associated 
temporary risk factor. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about the reasons for any recent admissions to hospital. Th ere may have been 
a recent episode of venous or rarely arterial thrombosis, or the patient may have 
been admitted for a procedure that has a high risk of thrombosis. Acquired throm-
bophilia is more likely in patients over age 50 years. 
 2.  Ask about the nature of thrombotic episodes. Th ese may have been arterial or venous, 
or both. Find out how often the problem has occurred and what part of the body 
was involved. 
 3.  Ask whether a thrombotic tendency has been identifi ed and how this was done (the 
patient may know).

 4.  Ask what anticoagulation therapy is currently being used. Th e possibilities include:
 •  unfractionated heparin 
 •  fractionated heparin given subcutaneously 
 •  low-molecular-weight heparin 
 •  warfarin 
 •  aspirin or (less likely) clopidogrel or dipyridamole 
 •  novel (non-vitamin-K antagonist, or direct) oral anticoagulant: NOAC (DOAC). 
 In Australia, anti-Xa agents apixaban and rivaroxaban are approved for both 
prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), whereas the direct 
thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is approved only for VTE prevention. Th ey are fi xed-
dose oral agents, compared with warfarin, and do not require routine monitoring. 
Adjustments are made to the dose for elderly patients and those with severe chronic 
kidney disease. Th ese agents are similar to conventional therapy (enoxaparin followed 
by warfarin), with similar rates of recurrence of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE) 
and bleeding events. Antidotes for anti-Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors are not 
widely available as yet. Th e NOACs are not recommended for patients with mechanical 
heart valves or malignancy-related thrombosis. 
 5.  If the patient is or has been on treatment with warfarin, fi nd out how much he or 
she understands about the drug, including the importance and necessary frequency 
of international normalised ratio (INR) testing and the target INR. Th e patient 
should probably know the most recent INR result and have some understanding of 
food and drug interactions with warfarin. For a patient on warfarin, ask about the 
usual frequency of blood tests and whether practical diffi  culties have been encoun-
tered in getting to the pathology laboratory. Ask who usually relays INR results 
and dosage changes to the patient, and whether the patient has ever used a home 
INR tester. 
 6.  Enquire about a family history of thrombosis and whether the patient ’ s own problem 
has led to the testing of other family members. In general, 50% of fi rst-degree relatives 
will inherit the mutation if there is an identifi ed autosomal dominant hereditary 
factor (e.g. protein C, protein S and antithrombin defi ciency). Remember, a family 
history of thrombosis greatly increases a patient ’ s risk. Patients with a thrombophilic 
defect, but without a family history of thrombosis, have only a slightly increased 
risk. Th e absence of a family history may make thrombophilia testing irrelevant, as 
positive tests will probably not change management. 
 
 
202
Examination Medicine
 7.  Ask about other factors that may increase thrombotic risk, including smoking, 
oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives, pregnancy, malignancy, recent surgery and 
immobility. Long aeroplane fl ights are controversial as a risk factor, but have received 
extensive discussion in the popular press. 
 8.  If the event has followed a surgical operation, ask what prophylaxis was used to try 
to prevent thrombosis. 
 9.  In women, ask about previous unexplained miscarriages. Th is can be associated with 
the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which are autoantibodies against various 
platelet surface molecules, including phospholipids. Th ese include lupus anticoagulant 
(which prolongs the aPTT), anticardiolipin and anti- β 2 glycoprotein antibodies. 
Consider this possibility too if there is a history of unusual thromboses or eclampsia 
and pre-eclampsia. 
 10.  Specifi cally ask about previous myocardial infarction. Th e occurrence of myocardial 
infarction in young women with normal coronary arteries has been associated with 
factor V Leiden mutation. 
 11.  Ask whether there have been chronic venous problems in the legs. Damage to the 
venous system can cause chronic oedema and ulceration that can be quite disabling 
(post-thrombotic syndrome). If there have been chronic problems, asking detailed 
questions about their eff ect on the patient ’ s life is essential. 
 12.  Ask about the congenital abnormality, homocysteinuria, which is associated with a 
Marfanoid habitus and premature strokes and coronary artery disease. Homocysteine 
is a thrombophilic agent. 
 13.  Ask about features of PNH – recurrent episodes of dark urine, anaemia and 
pancytopenia. 
 14.  Ask about malignancy – cancer is a major risk factor for the development of VTE 
especially in the elderly. Ask about past and family history of malignancy and previous 
screening tests performed. Perform a systems review to fi nd systems that may warrant 
further investigations. 
 The examination 
 1.  Note the presence or absence of an intravenous heparin infusion. If present, look at 
the infusion rate. 
 2.  Note the presence of obesity and look for signs of venous insuffi  ciency from previous 
venous thromboses. 
 3.  Examine the legs for oedema, venous ulceration and venous valvular insuffi  ciency. 
 4.  Check the peripheral pulses for evidence of arterial obstruction. 
 5.  Note the presence of abdominal wall bruising from subcutaneous low-molecular-weight 
heparin injections. 
 6.  Th ere may be evidence of a myeloproliferative disorder, SLE, nephrotic syndrome 
(oedema) or a malignancy. 
 Investigations 
 Th ere is a case now for testing anyone with a signifi cant arterial or venous thrombosis 
for thrombophilic factors ( Tables 8.4 and  8.5 ), especially those with a family history of 
thromboembolic disease. Certainly, unusual or repeated thromboses should be investigated, 
as set out below. Th e currently available routine screening tests are listed in  Table 8.6 .
 1.  Factor V Leiden is an abnormal factor V molecule. Th e abnormality is caused by a 
point mutation that aff ects the cleavage site on the activated molecule. Th e abnormal 
factor V is resistant to neutralisation by APC, which forms part of the natural anti-
coagulation pathway. Th e condition is also called APC resistance, along with other

rare mutations that lead to the same functional defect. Th e mutation occurs in 4% 
of the general population in Australia and in up to 50% of people with a family 
history of recurrent venous thrombosis. Th e condition is autosomal dominant. Th e 
heterozygous state is associated with an eightfold increase in venous thrombotic risk; 
the homozygous state also occurs and these people have 100 times the average risk. 
 Th e thrombotic risk is higher for women with this condition because of the additional 
risk associated with pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives containing oestrogen. 
Use of these drugs causes a 35 times increased risk of a thrombotic event (approximately 
a 3% risk over 10 years). Th e mechanism is probably that of lowering antithrombin 
levels. 
 2.  Antithrombin defi ciency is present in a mild form in about 1 in 2000 of the popula-
tion. Th e thrombotic risk is somewhat unpredictable, but the occurrence of a fi rst 
thrombotic event in these patients is a relative indication for lifelong anticoagulation 
therapy with warfarin. 
 3.  Proteins C and S are natural anticoagulants. Th eir defi ciency is associated with 
recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but the level of increased 
risk is less clear than that for the abnormalities above. Th ere is overlap between the 
serum levels in people with, and apparently those without, an increased risk of 
thrombosis. Testing must occur after at least 2 weeks without warfarin treatment. In 
homozygotes with protein C defi ciency, warfarin may induce skin necrosis. 
 4.  Prothrombin gene mutation is present in about 3% of the Australian population. 
Th is point mutation leads to an increased plasma level of prothrombin. Its detection 
requires DNA PCR analysis. It is an autosomal dominant trait and leads to a fourfold 
increase in the risk of venous thrombosis. 
 
 
204
Examination Medicine
 5.  Homocysteine level is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and 
may play a role in venous thrombosis in certain patients with inherited enzyme 
defi ciencies in homocysteine metabolism. Th e test for genetic mutation is available, 
but usually not indicated for venous thrombosis alone. 
 6.  Combined thrombophilic abnormalities are relatively common and further increase 
the thrombotic risk. 
 7.  Antiphospholipid syndrome is diagnosed if there is clinical evidence of thrombosis 
or a suggestive history of miscarriage plus an abnormal antiphospholipid antibody 
test on two occasions.  Anticardiolipin antibodies and  lupus anticoagulant ( IgG or  IgM 
antiphospholipid  ) antibodies are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombus 
and arterial embolus. In most cases, both are abnormal. Th e transient presence of 
these antibodies at low titres is common, is often associated with infection and is 
probably not of clinical signifi cance. Th ey may be present as part of SLE or occur 
alone (primary antiphospholipid syndrome). 
 8.  Consider investigations for other diseases that are ‘prothrombotic’. Th ese include 
malignancy, cardiac failure, nephrotic syndrome and haematological conditions such 
as PNH, polycythaemia and thrombocythaemia. A limited screening for occult 
malignancy may be warranted. 
 Management 
 Try to identify transient and continuing risk factors.
 1.  In general, an initial episode of thrombosis is treated in the usual way, with low-molecular-
weight heparin or intravenous non-fractionated heparin or NOACs. Th is should be followed 
by at least 6 months of anticoagulation for idiopathic above-knee DVTs or for PE, with 
discussion on risks and benefi ts of long-term anticoagulation. Th e use of a NOAC, which 
off ers the convenience of a fi xed dose, should be discussed. Initial treatment with heparin 
is not always necessary because of the rapid onset of action of these drugs; heparin is still 
preferred for initial therapy in certain circumstances, such as initial treatment in patients 
with unstable VTE such as massive PEs or in pregnancy-related VTE. 
 2.  Patients with antithrombin defi ciency will still respond to treatment with heparin 
because of the presence of small amounts of antithrombin III. Tests for the vitamin-
K-dependent proteins C and S should be performed before the patient is begun on 
warfarin. 
 3.  Patients with protein C and S defi ciency or heterozygous APC resistance do not need 
long-term anticoagulation until after their second thrombotic event. Homozygous 
APC defi ciency is an indication for long-term warfarin treatment. 
 4.  All patients with thrombophilia and their aff ected asymptomatic relatives need aggressive 
prophylaxis before surgery or during periods of immobilisation. Surgical prophylactic 
treatment should include heparin, compressive stockings and foot pumps, and early 
mobilisation. Aspirin is of proven benefi t for the secondary prevention of venous 
thrombosis. Individuals who are at risk during air travel, such as those with hereditary 
thrombophilia and a history of VTE, need consideration for prophylaxis (NOAC or 
subcutaneous fractionated heparin) if travelling for  > 6 hours. Th ey may benefi t from 
general measures (frequent ambulation, hydration and calf exercises) as well as graduated 
compression stockings. Pharmacological prophylaxis needs to be individually assessed. 
 5.  Pregnant women with a history of DVT require prophylaxis (with heparin) throughout 
pregnancy and until the puerperium. Warfarin and NOACs are contraindicated in 
pregnancy. 
 6.  Th e detection of antiphospholipid antibodies in women with miscarriages is an 
indication for treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin with or without low-dose

aspirin during pregnancy. Patients should be advised strongly against smoking and 
should avoid oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Progesterone-only preparations 
appear to be safe. 
 7.  Th ere is still controversy about the long-term treatment of patients with antiphospholipid 
syndrome, but recurrent unexpected thrombosis is an indication for long-term 
anticoagulation with warfarin maintaining an INR between 2 and 3. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Would you recommend that  this patient change from warfarin to a NOAC? 
 2.  How would you advise  this woman with a history of pulmonary embolism about 
the management of her pregnancy? 
 Polycythaemia 
 Th e myeloproliferative disorders ( Table 8.7 ) often occur in the clinical examination. 
Th ey present a diagnostic and management problem. Primary polycythaemia vera, or 
polycythaemia rubra vera (erythraemia or increased red cell mass), is the commonest 
myeloproliferative disease. It occurs in late middle life and is slightly commoner in 
males. Secondary causes of polycythaemia (erythrocytosis) must be excluded ( Table 8.8 ). 
 The history 
 Th e patient will probably know the diagnosis. If you suspect polycythaemia, ask about:
 1.  symptoms of polycythaemia or polycythaemia vera:
 a.  vascular problems, such as:
 •  transient ischaemic episodes 
 •  angina 
 •  peripheral vascular disease (thrombosis and digital ischaemia) 
 •  intra-abdominal venous thrombosis, including the Budd–Chiari syndrome 
 b.  bleeding from the nose and bruising 
 c.  symptoms of peptic ulceration (increased four to fi ve times in polycythaemia rubra 
vera) 
 d.  abdominal pain or discomfort from gross splenomegaly or urate stones 
 e.  pruritus after showering (‘aquagenic pruritis’) 1 
 f.  gout

 b.  sleep disorders and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) 
 c.  chronic cardiac or congenital heart diseases 
 d.  renal diseases (especially polycystic kidneys, hydronephrosis or erythropoietin 
secretion from a tumour including renal cell cancer and hepatic cell cancer) 
 e.  the use of coal tar derivatives, which can cause the production of abnormal hae-
moglobin such as methaemoglobin, as secondary polycythaemia may occur as a 
result of methaemoglinaemia 
 3.  investigations performed and how the diagnosis was made, e.g.:
 a.  blood counts 
 b.  abdominal imaging 
 c.  renal, pulmonary and cardiac investigations

 The examination 
 1.  Stand back and look at the patient. Note plethora ( Fig. 8.1 ), the state of hydration, 
cyanosis and any Cushingoid features. 
 2.  Examine the patient ’ s hands for nicotine stains, clubbing and signs of peripheral 
vascular disease. Note any gouty tophi. 
 3.  Look for scratch marks and bruising on the arms and take the blood pressure (systolic 
hypertension accompanies an increased red cell mass and phaeochromocytoma is 
associated with increased erythropoietin). 
 4.  Look at the eyes for injected conjunctivae and examine the fundi for hyperviscosity 
changes. 
 5.  Examine the tongue for central cyanosis. 
 6.  Examine the cardiovascular system for signs of cyanotic congenital heart disease, if 
appropriate, and the respiratory system for signs of chronic lung disease. 
 7.  Examine the abdomen for hepatomegaly (hepatoma must be excluded) and more 
importantly splenomegaly, which occurs in 80% of cases of polycythaemia rubra 
vera, but not in secondary polycythaemia. Palpate for renal masses (polycystic kidneys, 
hydronephrosis, carcinoma). Rarely, uterine fi bromas may be found, or very rarely 
virilisation may be noted. 
 8.  Look at the legs for scratch marks (pruritus may be secondary to elevated plasma 
histamine levels), gout and evidence of peripheral vascular disease. 
 9.  Auscultate over the cerebellar regions for a bruit (cerebellar haemangioblastoma). 
Note any upper motor neurone signs (cerebrovascular disease due to thrombosis or 
the hyperviscosity syndrome). 
 10.  Check the urine for evidence of renal disease.

 Investigations 
 Confi rm the presence of polycythaemia (haematocrit  > 60% for men or  > 56% for 
women) and establish whether this is primary or secondary. Remember that erythrocytosis 
is an increase in the absolute red cell mass, which occurs as a result of some stimulus 
(usually hypoxia), and erythraemia (polycythaemia vera) is an increase in red cell mass 
of unknown aetiology ( Table 8.9 ). 
 Note: Red cell mass and plasma volume are no longer routinely measured.
 1.  In polycythaemia vera the following are increased:
 a.  haemoglobin value 
 b.  haematocrit value 
 c.  red cell count, white cell count (including the absolute basophil count) 
 d.  platelet count and more variably the neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score. 
 Check the mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width (RDW). 
Microcytic erythrocytosis can be caused only by polycythaemia vera or hypoxic 
erythrocytosis (RDW usually elevated), or haemoglobinopathies (RDW normal). 
 2.  Th e ESR is very low in both primary and secondary polycythaemia. 
 3.  Assess for splenomegaly (and renal disease) with an abdominal ultrasound or CT 
scan. 
 4.  Check the arterial blood gases (in polycythaemia vera, 80% of patients have an arterial 
oxygen saturation  > 92% and in almost all it is  > 88%). 
 5.  Serum erythropoietin level is usually substantially reduced or absent in polycythaemia 
vera and elevated in secondary polycythaemia. Remember, however, that certain 
tumours (haemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, renal sarcoma and carcinoma of 
the liver) cause polycythaemia by excreting erythropoietin. 
 6.  Th e total vitamin B 12 level is elevated in 75% of cases of polycythaemia vera. Th e 
vitamin B 12 level is raised owing to increased transcobalamin I and III, made by 
neutrophils which have an increased turnover. 
 7.  Rule out renal disease, if indicated. 
 8.  In polycythaemia vera there is signifi cant panhyperplasia and iron stores are often reduced, 
but in secondary polycythaemia the bone marrow usually shows only an erythroid 
hyperplasia. Th ere are no consistent cytogenetic markers. Bone marrow biopsy is not 
essential for the diagnosis: it is necessary only if another myeloproliferative disorder is 
suspected. Fibrosis may be seen in the advanced stages of polycythaemia vera. 
 9.  Genetic testing is very useful. Th e  JAK2 mutation is present in most patients with 
polycythaemia vera. 
 Treatment 
 1.  Th e aim is to lower the haematocrit value to  < 0.42 in women and  < 0.45 in men 
and maintain it at this level. Patients may die of thrombosis, which seems related 
entirely to the elevated red cell mass. Th rombotic risk can usually be reduced with 
 Table 8.9   An approach to the diagnosis of polycythaemia vera

 2.  Splenomegaly

8 • The haematological long case
phlebotomy alone, but aspirin is usually thought to give additional protection. Untreated 
cases have a median survival of 2 years because of the thrombotic risk. Th is is extended 
to more than 10 years with phlebotomy alone. 
 Polycythaemia rubra vera should be treated by phlebotomy. 
 Frequent venesection is required until a state of iron defi ciency has been produced. 
Th is will then limit red cell production and the frequency may be reduced. 
 In patients at high risk for thrombosis (i.e. age  > 60 years, prior thrombosis), 
venesection should be supplemented with a myelosuppressive agent. Hydroxyurea is 
usually fi rst line but it increases the risk of leukaemia; interferon alpha (IFN- α ) may 
be a safer option in high-risk women of child-bearing age or a JAK2 inhibitor 
(ruxolitinib) in the setting of major constitutional symptoms. 
 2.  Radioactive phosphorus (phosphorus-32) irradiates the bone marrow and was easy 
to use and eff ective, but it increases the incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia and is 
no longer available. 
 3.  Alkylating agents (e.g. busulfan) must be monitored closely for the same reason and 
should not be given routinely. Both P32 and busulfan substantially increase the risk 
of secondary acute leukaemia (6–10 fold). 
 4.  Pruritus may not respond to antihistamines, and IFN- α or psoralen with ultraviolet 
light (PUVA) therapy may be required. 
 5.  Hyperuricaemia should be treated with allopurinol. 
 6.  IFN- α may help reduce the problem of symptomatic splenomegaly. 
 7.  Secondary polycythaemia is treated by removal of the cause. Consider phlebotomy 
if the haematocrit exceeds 0.55 or there is a high thrombotic risk, or a high degree 
of hyperviscosity symptoms. 
 Median survival is more than 10 years for treated patients

 Rapid splenic enlargement can cause splenic infarction (with the sudden onset of left 
upper quadrant pain and tenderness). Th e typical patient is over 50 years of age and 
has marked splenomegaly ( > 10 cm) and mild-to-moderate hepatomegaly. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Th e white cell counts may be normal, increased or decreased. Th e blood fi lm will 
show teardrop poikilocytes and a leukoerythroblastic picture (i.e. presence of myelocytes, 
metamyelocytes and nucleated red blood cells). Any process that infi ltrates the bone 
marrow may cause this picture (e.g. malignancy, TB, fungi). 
 2.  Bone marrow biopsy (aspiration is usually impossible) may reveal karyotypic abnormali-
ties on cytogenetic examination. Th is fi nding is associated with a worse prognosis. 
Th e  JAK2 V617F mutation is seen in up to 50% of cases. 
 3.  Th e condition must be distinguished from myelofi brosis secondary to other conditions 
that may be amenable to specifi c treatment, such as:
 •  lymphoma 
 •  leukaemia 
 •  myeloma 
 •  polycythaemia 
 •  chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 
 •  systemic lupus erythematosus. 
 Treatment 
 Treatment is primarily supportive. Most patients are treated with repeated blood 
transfusions.
 1.  Hydroxyurea is helpful for symptomatic patients with organomegaly or marked 
thrombocytosis. 
 2.  Folate and vitamin B 12 may help if these are defi cient; erythropoietin has not been 
particularly eff ective. Allopurinol is used when there is hyperuricaemia. 
 3.  Splenectomy may be indicated if massive splenomegaly has occurred. 
 4.  Alkylating agents are contraindicated. 
 5.  Cure is possible only with allogenic bone marrow transplantation for the few patients 
who are young enough and for whom a suitable donor can be found. 
 6.  Leukaemic transformation may occur in 10% of patients. 
 7.  Th e JAK2 kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib is eff ective at ameliorating the natural history 
and reducing splenic volume; the eff ect is seen even in those patients who do not 
harbour the  JAK2 mutation.

8 • The haematological long case
 Essential thrombocythaemia 
 Th is is a relatively common form of chronic myeloproliferative clonal disorder. Many 
patients are asymptomatic and the diagnosis is made on a routine platelet count. 
 Patients may present with symptoms related to a high platelet count ( > 800  × 10 9 / L; 
some patients with even higher counts are ‘platelet millionaires’) – especially thrombo-
embolism, but also poor memory, erythromelalgia (painful, red extremities) and migraine. 
Patients may have haemorrhagic problems, especially from the gut, and easy bruising 
due to abnormal platelet aggregation at very high platelet counts. An acquired defi ciency 
of von Willebrand factor (VWF) may occur when platelet numbers are very high. Th is 
may be due to increased numbers of circulating platelets resulting in increased binding 
and removal of large VWF multimers from plasma. 
 Modest splenomegaly ( < 5 cm) is seen in 50% of patients. 
 Investigations 
 1.  A defi nitive diagnosis requires exclusion of reactive thrombocytosis secondary to 
infection, polycythaemia, malignancy, infl ammation, bleeding, recent surgery or an 
asplenic state. 
 2.  Cytogenetic studies may be necessary to exclude CML (Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome 
t(9;22) or its products: BCR–ABL fusion mRNA or BCR–ABL protein). 
 3.  Th e  JAK 2 V617F mutation is seen in 50% of cases. 
 Treatment 
 1.  Asymptomatic patients, even if they have a platelet count of more than one million, 
often need no treatment. Unexpectedly, bleeding tends to be more of a problem when 
the platelet count is over one million and thrombosis when it is less than one million. 
 2.  Neurological symptoms and erythromelalgia should fi rst be treated with aspirin. 
Failure of response is an indication to reduce platelet numbers, usually with hydroxyurea 
or IFN- α . Anagrelide is a more specifi c antimegakaryocyte agent that can be useful 
for symptomatic patients, but hydroxyurea and aspirin may be more eff ective in 
preventing vascular events. 
 3.  Transformation to acute leukaemia is uncommon ( < 10%) and often the result of 
prior alkylating chemotherapy. 
 4.  Th e condition usually runs an indolent and benign course and the continuing temptation 
to treat asymptomatic patients should be strongly resisted. A small percentage of cases 
transform to acute leukaemia or myelofi brosis.

 NOTES ON HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES 
 1.  Survival has improved, e.g.:
 •  Hodgkin ’ s long-term survival – 85% 
 •  childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) – 78% 
 •  diff use large cell lymphoma treated with rituximab and chemotherapy – 60%. 
 2.  Many treated patients may have late eff ects of treatment:
 •  secondary malignancies: acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), breast cancer, skin 
malignancies 
 •  osteoporosis 
 •  cardiac disease: early coronary disease, left ventricular dysfunction – anthracyclines 
 •  neurocognitive defects 
 •  pulmonary disease: interstitial lung disease, bronchiolitis obliterans (cryptogenic 
organising pneumonia) 
 •  endocrine disease: early menopause, infertility – ask about ovum or sperm harvesting 
and storage. Patients may be on hormone replacement treatment (men and women). 
 Chronic myeloid leukaemia 
 Many patients with CML are diagnosed from routine blood tests – symptoms tend not 
to be specifi c ( Table 8.11 ). Patients are between 30 and 80 years old with a peak incidence 
at 55. It is rare, but accounts for about 20% of leukaemias. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Patients may have moderate splenomegaly (6–8 cm) and a white cell count  > 50  × 
10 9 / L. Th e white cell diff erential count will show two peaks: one at the neutrophil 
stage and the other at the myelocyte stage. 
 2.  Basophilia and eosinophilia are common. 
 3.  In the blast phase over 20% of white cells are blasts. 
 4.  Diagnosis depends on fi nding the Ph chromosome ( > 90%) – a shortened chromosome 
22. Translocation of part of chromosome 22 to chromosome 9 results in a hybrid 
gene  BCR–ABL rearrangement on chromosome 9. Th is  BCR–ABL fusion gene is an 
oncogene coding for a protein with tyrosine kinase activity which aff ects cell prolifera-
tion, diff erentiation and survival.

 5.  Th e platelet count is usually elevated and there is mild normochromic anaemia. 
 6.  Th ere is no association with alkylating agents and no evidence of a viral cause. 
 Treatment 
 Untreated, the disease will eventually undergo blastic transformation.
 1.  A cure or long-term remission can be achieved with allogenic bone marrow transplanta-
tion from a compatible donor in those who fail to respond or are intolerant of tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor therapy (see below). 
 2.  Imatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor – TKI) has revolutionised treatment of CML. 
Th is drug causes apoptosis of cells expressing  BCR–ABL. It is now the fi rst-line 
treatment for all patients. Its use can be associated with:
 •  hepatotoxicity 
 •  myalgia 
 •  fl uid retention. 
 Th e therapeutic target of all TKI treatment is the achievement of a major molecular 
response, which is defi ned as a  ≥ 3 log reduction of the baseline quantitative  BCR–ABL 
assay, preferably before 12 months from the point of commencing treatment (i.e.  ≤ 
0.1%  BCR–ABL transcript to housekeeping genes is a major response; non-detectable 
on two consecutive samples is a complete response). Some patients will develop 
mutations in the  BCR–ABL transcript that confer resistance to imatinib. Second-
generation TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib, are available and are active in these cases 
– they are also available as fi rst-line therapy. Th e choice of the agent in fi rst-line 
therapy is dependent on matching the side-eff ect profi le with co-morbidity. It is 
possible to switch between agents if there is a suboptimal molecular response. Side-
eff ects include oedema, GI intolerance and rash (imatinib); pleural eff usion (dasatinib); 
and increased risk of vascular complications (nilotinib). 
 3.  IFN- α therapy is sometimes helpful in the chronic phase. It may induce diff erentiation 
of the immature cells and be synergistic with imatinib in achieving a major molecular 
response. 
 Possible line of questioning 
 How would you discuss the treatment options and side-effects with  this patient with 
newly diagnosed CML? 
 Lymphomas 
 Th ese diseases provide complicated diagnostic and management problems. Treatment 
in expert units is important, because many patients can be cured. Cure should be possible 
in more than 85% of patients with Hodgkin disease and in up to 40% of those with 
non-Hodgkin lymphomas. 
 Remember that the cell lineage is uncertain for Hodgkin disease (although probably mostly 
B cell), but 80% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in Australia are of B cell origin. Th ere are a 
number of slightly diff erent classifi cation systems. Some are based on the cell type ( Table 
8.12 ), some on histopathology ( Table 8.13 ) and others on clinical staging ( Table 8.14 ). 
 Note: Fortunately only four types of lymphoma are common: diff use large cell and 
follicular cell in people over 40, Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma in people under 40 and small 
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) / chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in the elderly.

 Note: There is an overlap of cell types between leukaemias and lymphomas. Leukaemia is diagnosed when 
the malignant cells are primarily found in the blood and bone marrow, and lymphoma when there are solid 
tumours of the immune system. 
 MALT  = mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. 
 Hodgkin lymphoma (see  Table 8.13 ) presents either with discrete, rubbery, painless 
nodes or with generalised symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss and sometimes 
pruritus). Mediastinal adenopathy usually occurs in young people with nodular sclerosing 
disease. Older people with generalised symptoms, in whom the only enlarged nodes 
may be in the abdomen, often have lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin disease. 
 Th e majority of cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (see  Table 8.13 ) present with 
painless enlargement of peripheral lymph nodes (a lymph node of  > 1 cm diameter that 
has been present for 6 weeks or more for no obvious reason should be biopsied). Th e 
great majority of patients with peripheral lymph node enlargement do not have a 
malignancy. Localised or generalised painless adenopathy with or without hepatosple-
nomegaly may also occur. It may present with just an abdominal mass. Presentation 
with mediastinal adenopathy is much less common than in patients with Hodgkin 
disease (except in T lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary mediastinal B large cell 
lymphoma where mediastinal disease is always present). In some patients the disease 
may arise at an extranodal site (e.g. the gastrointestinal tract – 5%). Th ese patients may 
present with abdominal pain, obstruction or haemorrhage. 
 Waldeyer ’ s ring, mesenteric and epitrochlear node involvement are more common in 
non-Hodgkin than in Hodgkin disease. In low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lym-
phadenopathy has often been present for a long time. 
 Other uncommon presentations include skin infi ltration and direct renal infi ltration. 
Primary neurological infi ltration is also uncommon. Low-grade gastrointestinal lymphomas 
(e.g. mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas) are less common.

 The history 
 1.  Ask about the presenting symptoms and causes of symptoms, such as palpable nodes, 
cough as a result of mediastinal node involvement, systemic symptoms, bone pain 
due to marrow infi ltration or pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, splenic 
pain and alcohol-induced pain (rare). 
 2.  Is there a history of infection (as a result of decreased cell-mediated immunity in 
Hodgkin disease or depressed humoral immunity from chemotherapy or radiotherapy)? 
 
 
216
Examination Medicine
 3.  Ask about the history of the predisposing condition, such as Klinefelter ’ s syndrome, 
HIV infection, congenital or acquired immune defi ciency, use of immunosuppressive 
drugs or autoimmune disease (e.g. Sjögren ’ s syndrome). Ask also about the use of 
phenytoin (pseudo-lymphoma). 
 4.  Find out the investigations performed – particularly lymph node biopsy and PET or 
CT scans. MRI scanning may have been used for suspected spinal cord, brain or 
bone marrow involvement. Lymphangiography and staging laparotomy are now rarely 
indicated. Lumbar puncture is important in high-grade lymphoma investigation if 
central nervous system involvement is suspected. PET scans are replacing other 
modalities for staging and bone marrow biopsy for staging is required only in certain 
lymphomas (usually NHL). 
 5.  Ask about the treatment undertaken, as this gives an indication of the stage and type 
of disease. Ask about the side-eff ects of any treatment; for example, a radiation fi eld 
such as mantle radiation can result in:
 •  pneumonitis 
 •  hypothyroidism 
 •  pericarditis 
 •  myocardial fi brosis 
 •  spinal cord injury. 
 Ask whether the patient has been informed about possible long-term complications 
of treatment. 
 6.  Determine the prognosis given and what the patient ’ s understanding of this seems 
to be. 
 7.  Find out about the patient ’ s social situation – dependent family members, social 
support, ability to work, reactions to disease (e.g. depression, coping mechanisms), 
etc. As for other malignancies, work out the Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status ( Table 8.15 ). 
 The examination 
 1.  Examine the haemopoietic system thoroughly. Particularly note any lymph nodes 
( Fig. 8.2 ) and assess carefully for splenomegaly. 
 2.  Attempt to stage the disease clinically (see  Table 8.14 ). Remember that staging is 
much less relevant for non-Hodgkin lymphomas because spread is haematogenous 
and not contiguous. Fewer than 10% of even nodular non-Hodgkin lymphomas are 
localised and suitable for local irradiation at the time of presentation. 
 3.  Note any radiotherapy marks (and the fi eld covered). 
 4.  Look for evidence of infection (e.g. herpes zoster).

 Treatment 
 HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (85% OF PATIENTS ARE CURABLE) 
 Treatment depends on the stage of the disease (see  Table 8.14 ) and presence of risk 
factors. Histological type is less important.
 •  Stages I, IIA and IIB – radiotherapy or abbreviated course of chemotherapy followed 
by radiotherapy (20 Gy to aff ected sites). 
 •  Stages III and IV – full course of standard chemotherapy (e.g. ABVD – adriamycin, 
bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) or escalated chemotherapy. Consolidation 
radiotherapy may be considered in those with bulky disease (up to 30 Gy). 
 Salvage treatment 
 Relapse less than 1 year after initial treatment or failure to achieve complete remission 
is an indication for second-line therapy. For relapse after more than 1 year, retreatment 
can be given using the original regimen. Further radiotherapy can be used for relapse 
outside the radiation fi eld if the patient has early-stage disease. Autologous stem cell 
transplant after high-dose chemotherapy is an alternative.

8 • The haematological long case
 Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody–drug conjugate directed against CD30 on the 
Reed–Sternberg cell. It can produce good responses for patients who have failed standard 
treatment and may be a bridge to allogenic transplant. 
 Prognosis 
 Th is depends on the stage, disease bulk, age and performance status. In general, in:
 •  stage I, expect 85%–95% 10 years disease-free survival 
 •  stage II, expect 80%–90% 10 years disease-free survival 
 •  stages III and IV, expect 60% 10 years disease-free survival. 
 Complications of treatment 
 1.  Th e improvement in survival achieved with current treatment means that complications 
of treatment are more likely to cause death in long-term survivors. Routine annual 
testing and review are recommended ( Table 8.16 ). 
 2.  Secondary malignancies, including leukaemia and carcinomas, are associated with 
the use of alkylating agents. 
 3.  Breast cancer risk is associated with chest irradiation. 
 4.  Chest radiotherapy also increases the risk of coronary artery disease after 10 years or 
more, and of hypothyroidism. 
 5.  Radiotherapy and chemotherapy increase the risk of carcinoma of the lung, which 
is signifi cantly greater again for smokers. 
 6.  Infertility can occur in men and women treated with chemotherapy. Th e chance of 
recovery of fertility is much greater for young patients. Sperm or ovarian tissue 
banking and fertility preservation may be off ered to patients. 
 NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA 
 Prognosis and treatment depend mainly on the histological type (particularly whether 
it is nodular or diff use and based on the International Working Formulation – see  Table 
8.13 ); most cases (80%) of low-grade lymphomas are stage III or IV at presentation 
and require only observation if the patient is asymptomatic ( Table 8.17 ). Symptoms 
suggesting a need for treatment include:
 •  systemic symptoms (weight loss, malaise, etc.) 
 •  bulky, uncomfortable lymph nodes 
 •  bone marrow failure 
 •  compression symptoms. 
 Th e International Prognostic Index ( Table 8.18 ) has proved a useful way of assessing 
the patient ’ s likely course. More recently, treatment decisions have been based on the 
WHO classifi cation (see  Table 8.12 ). 
 Treatment protocols: WHO classification

 2.  Mature B cell neoplasms: B cell CLL / SLL is the most common lymphoid leukaemia 
and represents about 75% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Patients with only bone 
marrow involvement and lymphocytosis are not usually treated. Th ey have a median 
survival of more than 10 years. Once liver and splenic involvement have occurred, 
treatment is likely to be required at some stage, but may not be recommended until 
bone marrow failure is present. Oral chlorambucil or the more potent intravenous 
drug fl udarabine, often combined with rituximab, is most often recommended. Young

patients may benefi t from bone marrow transplant. Newer CD20 antibodies such as 
ofatumumab and obinutuzumab may be used in combination with chlorambucil in 
fi rst-line therapy for the elderly or patients with multiple co-morbidities. Ibrutinib, 
a Bruton ’ s tyrosine kinase inhibitor that works through the B cell receptor signalling 
pathways, may be used for relapsed disease. Side-eff ects of ibrutinib include platelet 
dysfunction resulting in an increased bleeding risk and increased risk of atrial fi brillation. 
Idelalisib, an oral inhibitor of the PI3K signalling pathway, is also used in relapsed 
CLL. Side-eff ects include colitis and pneumonitis. 
 3.  MALT-type lymphoma (extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma) (8%): these 
gastric mucosal lymphomas are curable when localised. MALT is associated with 
 Helicobacter pylori infection. Eradication of the infection will usually induce remission 
(75%). Otherwise, radiation treatment is used and, for more widespread or resistant 
disease, rituximab-based therapy may be used. Endoscopic follow-up is important. 
Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) may follow hepatitis C infection, which 
should be treated; if symptomatic without hepatitis C, rituximab or splenectomy can 
induce a long remission. 
 4.  Mantle cell lymphoma (6%): the majority of these present as a systemic disease. 
Treatment is not very successful. Th e usual approach is combination chemotherapy 
followed by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used with rituximab (the anti-CD20 
antibody). Bone marrow transplant is off ered to younger patients. 
 5.  Follicular lymphoma (22%): asymptomatic patients may require no treatment. 
Combination treatment (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone 
(RCVP) or rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), oncovin 
(vincristine) and prednisone (R-CHOP)) can achieve a 75% remission rate. Maintenance 
rituximab treatment continued for up to 2 years is helpful to improve progression-free 
survival. Relapses are common and retreatment with multiple chemotherapy regimens 
is the usual clinical course. Between 5% and 7% of patients per year develop histological 
transformation into diff use large B cell lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma (low-grade) 
prognosis can be further estimated from  Table 8.19 . 
 6.  Diff use large B cell lymphoma (30%): treatment is usually begun with combination 
chemotherapy (often R-CHOP). Th is may be followed by radiotherapy if there is 
bulky stage I or stage II disease. Six cycles of treatment will produce a cure in up to 
70% of patients. Monoclonal antibody treatment with rituximab is used for most 
patients. Bone marrow transplant is more eff ective than further chemotherapy for

 7.  Burkitt lymphoma: this is a rare disease in Australia, but is more common in Africa. 
Intensive combination chemotherapy with attention to the central nervous system 
will produce a cure in about 70% of patients. 
 8.  Hairy cell leukaemia: this is an indolent lymphoma with leukaemic features. Th e 
peripheral smear shows lymphocytes with hairy projections. Look for splenomegaly 
and cytopenia. It responds well to chemotherapy with cladribine. 
 9.  Immunodefi ciency-associated lymphoma: the WHO classifi es these lymphomas 
into four groups:
 a.  lymphoproliferative diseases associated with primary immune disorders 
 b.  HIV-associated lymphomas 
 c.  post-transplant lymphomas 
 d.  methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 
 Th ese are usually aggressive B cell, CNS and Hodgkin lymphomas, and treatment is 
as for the type of lymphoma. 
 Bone marrow (haematopoietic stem cell) transplant 
 Disease resistant to standard-dose chemotherapy can be treated with bone marrow 
‘conditioning’. Th is means ablation or partial ablation of the bone marrow using 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both. Bone marrow transplant is then performed with 
autologous stem cells (from bone marrow or peripheral blood) or, less often, cells from 
a compatible donor. Th e mortality rate associated with this procedure (now  < 5% in 
low-risk autologous transplants) and the success of engraftment have improved with the 
use of haematopoietic growth factors. Long-term outcomes are uncertain, as are the 
indications for the use of this treatment in patients with less aggressive disease. Follow-up 
of treated non-Hodgkin lymphomas is similar to that for Hodgkin lymphoma patients. 
Allogenic bone marrow transplant is less well established in the treatment of lymphomas. 
It is also used for aplastic anaemia and some inherited diseases of blood cell production 
(e.g. immunodefi ciencies and thalassaemia). 
 Ask a transplant patient about complications of the procedure (see  Table 8.24 ).

 3.  Ask about treatment – ask about drugs (e.g. bisphosphonates, thalidomide) and their 
side-eff ects, radiotherapy and bone marrow transplant (actual or planned). 
 4.  Enquire about the patient ’ s social history, including dependants, work, ADLs, etc. 
 5.  Determine the patient ’ s understanding of this life-threatening condition and its prognosis 
– how much information he or she has about possible further problems and treatment. 
 The examination 
 1.  Inspect the patient for signs of:
 a.  weight loss 
 b.  anaemia 
 c.  general debility. 
 2.  Examine the haemopoietic system. Pay particular attention to a search for bony tender-
ness. Kyphosis may be caused by compression fractures. Splenomegaly and lymphad-
enopathy occur only very rarely. 
 3.  Note signs of anaemia and purpura. Look for skin rash. 
 4.  Look for signs of infection (e.g. pulmonary consolidation). 
 5.  Check carefully for any signs of spinal cord compression. 
 6.  Check the urine analysis and temperature chart. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Once the diagnosis is suspected, check the full blood count (and fi lm) for anaemia (and 
rouleaux) and a raised ESR. Obtain a serum protein electrophoretogram (SPEP or EPG) 
of serum and urine and an immunoelectrophoretogram (IEPG). An ‘M’ component 
(monoclonal globulin peak) is found in 95% of cases (any immunoglobulin class may 
appear as the ‘M’ component). Light chains are present in the urine in 50%–75% of 
patients (Bence–Jones proteinuria cannot be detected by dipstick urine analysis). 
 2.  Analysis of circulating light chains in the serum is a more sensitive way of detecting 
light chain myeloma as an abnormal  κ : λ ratio is seen. It is helpful in monitoring the 
response to treatment of such patients. 
 3.  Th e bone marrow must be examined for plasma cells ( > 10% in myeloma). Check 
the beta 2 -microglobulin level (see below). Also check the serum calcium, urate levels 
and the renal function. 
 4.  Look at X-ray fi lms of the skull ( Fig. 8.4 ), chest, pelvis ( Fig. 8.5 ) and proximal long 
bones for fractures, osteoporosis and lytic lesions. As there is little osteoblastic activity, 
bone scans are much less sensitive than plain X-rays. 
 5.  MRI scans may be the best way to investigate pain and possible nerve root or spinal 
cord compression. 
 Th e diagnostic features of multiple myeloma, in order of importance, are:
 •  clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow ( ≥ 10% involvement is consistent with the 
diagnosis) or soft tissue plasmacytoma 
 •  CRAB (hyper C alcaemia,  R enal disease,  A naemia and  B one lytic lesions) 
 •  production of serum and/or urine paraprotein (50% are IgG, 33% are IgA, 5% are 
IgM, 10% are only light chains, 2% are nil). 
 Th e disease can be staged according to certain criteria ( Table 8.21 ). 
 An elevated serum beta 2 -microglobulin level (which refl ects the myeloma cell burden and 
renal functional impairment) indicates a reduced median survival. Other poor prognostic 
features include advanced age and certain high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. With 
the use of newer anti-myeloma therapies, survival for multiple myeloma is improving.

 Treatment 
 1.  Irradiation is helpful for localised bone pain and spinal cord compression. Patients 
with a single bone plasmacytoma will often get prolonged disease-free survival after 
treatment with local radiotherapy.
 a.  Zolendronate or one of the other bisphosphonates should be given to patients 
with more than stage I disease. 
 b.  Bisphosphonates reduce bone pain, fracture rates and episodes of hypercalcaemia. 
Th ere is evidence that they improve the prognosis. 
 2.  For those with more diff use disease:
 a.  General measures, such as adequate hydration and use of bicarbonate for Bence–Jones 
proteinuria, are important to prevent renal failure. Intravenous contrast material 
must be used cautiously and only with excellent hydration. 
 b.  Allopurinol may protect renal function from urate nephropathy related to 
treatment. 
 c.  Treat hypercalcaemia and bacterial infection. 
 d.  Avoid live vaccines. 
 e.  Erythropoietin may improve the anaemia. 
 3.  Is the patient a candidate for transplant (usually an autograft) ( Fig. 8.6a )? Suitable 
patients:
 •  have a low ECOG score 
 •  are  < 70 years old 
 •  have few co-morbidities. 
 Transplant-related mortality is now  < 1%. 
 4.  Systemic therapy is indicated for patients who are symptomatic or have evidence of 
end-organ damage. Treatment is begun with high-dose steroids in combination with 
thalidomide or cyclophosphamide. An alternative is bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor, 
as upfront therapy in combination with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide. Th e 
latter option is preferred in those suitable for autologous transplant or who have renal 
impairment at diagnosis. 
 Th e most important side-eff ect of thalidomide and bortezomib, and to a lesser 
extent of lenalidomide, is peripheral neuropathy. Patients being initiated with anti-
myeloma therapy, particularly with thalidomide, should be considered for VTE 
prophylaxis as their risk of venous thrombosis is high. 
 5.  Alkylating agents should be avoided if the patient may be a candidate for haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant. Such drugs may prevent stem cell harvesting by damaging these 
cells. Melphalan and prednisone were standard treatment; other alkylating agents 
(e.g. cyclophosphamide) are probably equally eff ective for patients unsuitable for 
bone marrow transplant. Resistance to one alkylating agent is often, but not always, 
associated with resistance to the others.

intermittently until it is no longer tolerated or there is a loss of response. Th e patient ’ s 
progress must be monitored with regular protein EPG studies.

 Treatment of the myeloma component in the usual way often helps the other manifesta-

of peripheral neuropathy to respiratory failure over some years. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Is there a differential diagnosis for  this patient with a diagnosis of myeloma? 
 2.  Is local treatment or systemic treatment indicated for  this patient with myeloma? 
 3.  Should alkylating agents be used for  this patient? 
 Bone marrow (haematopoietic cell) transplantation 
 Bone marrow transplantation is being performed for an increasing number of indications. 
Patients are chronically ill and often available for examinations. Two groups of patients are 
treated in this way: fi rst, those with a malignant condition ( Table 8.22 ), who have had 
their bone marrow conditioned by irradiation or chemotherapy given in marrow-toxic 
doses to treat a malignancy. Partial marrow ablation is increasingly used especially in 
older patients. Th e other indication is for patients with a defective bone marrow, often 
the result of an inherited disease ( Table 8.23 ). Autologous transplants (when the patient ’ s 
own marrow or stem cells are stored and then re-infused) are now more common than 
allogenic transplants (when another person is used as the donor of marrow or stem cells). 
 The history 
 As with all transplant long cases, you may fi nd it most effi  cient to start with asking 
about current management including medications and follow-up, then work your way 
to establish an understanding of the previous events occurring around or after transplant

(primarily infection and rejection-related complications) and then focus on the points 
mentioned below:
 1.  Ask what the indication for the transplant was. 
 2.  Find out whether there has been a problem leading to the current admission to 
hospital (if the patient is an inpatient). 
 3.  Ask whether other treatment has been tried unsuccessfully. (For example, bone 
marrow transplant is often the treatment of choice for relapse after treatment for 
leukaemia or lymphoma.) 
 4.  Find out whether the bone marrow transplant was autologous or allogenic. How 
was the marrow conditioned before transplant (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both) 
and, if the transplant was autologous, how were the stem cells harvested (from 
peripheral blood or by bone marrow aspiration)? 
 5.  If the transplant was allogenic, does the patient know the donor? Only about 30% 
of people have an HLA-compatible relative. For the rest, a volunteer unrelated donor 
is used. HLA antigens are inherited together and rarely cross over. Th e patient may 
know how close the match was. 
 6.  Ask for how long the patient was in hospital after transplantation. (Engraftment is 
usually quicker and complications are fewer after autologous transplant.) Ask specifi cally 
about problems with infection in the early period and how complications were 
managed. 
 7.  Find out what eff ects this complicated illness and treatment have had on the patient ’ s 
life and ability to work. Ask about family and fi nancial problems. Young patients 
are likely to have been made sterile by the treatment. Total body irradiation and the 
use of alkylating agents are more likely than other treatments to cause permanent 
sterility. Women more often regain fertility than men. Ask tactfully whether the 
patient is aware of this and whether harvesting of oocytes or sperm was undertaken. 
 8.  Ask how eff ective the treatment has been. Does the patient feel better or worse than 
before and what medium- and long-term prognosis has he or she been given? 
 9.  Ask whether there have been specifi c transplant-associated problems. Ask specifi cally 
about the symptoms and signs of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and the other 
complications of allogenic transplantation ( Table 8.24 ). 
 10.  Ask about the patient ’ s current medications including any regular injections (e.g. 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), bisphosphonates, rituximab), and check for 
side-eff ects and adherence.

 11.  Ask about the impact of disease and hospital admissions on the patient at each point 
of their illness, and currently. 
 12.  Ask about any regular screening relating to their condition and for age-appropriate 
cancer screening. 
 The examination 
 Examine for persisting or recurrent signs of the condition for which the bone marrow 
transplant was performed.
 1.  Examine for signs of chronic GVHD. Th ese include skin changes similar to those of 
scleroderma, dry eyes and mouth (sicca syndrome), alopecia and bronchiolitis obliterans 
(signs of airfl ow obstruction). 
 2.  Examine for hepatic enlargement and ascites (hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome). 
Feel all the lymph node groups (e.g. enlarged as a result of a second malignancy, such 
as ALL or melanoma) and examine the eyes (e.g. secondary glioblastoma). 
 3.  Look for signs of infection in the lungs and for herpes zoster. 
 4.  Examine the hips (aseptic osteonecrosis). 
 5.  Patients who have had radiotherapy may show evidence of hypothyroidism. 
 6.  Look for any neurological signs. 
 Management 
 Detailed discussion about methods of transplantation will not be required.
 1.  Management after transplant begins with supportive treatment to prevent infection 
and bleeding before engraftment occurs. Platelet and blood transfusions may be 
required and the patient is usually kept isolated. Transfused products are irradiated 
to prevent GVHD from transfused lymphocytes. Most patients receive colony-
stimulating factors to speed recovery. Platelet recovery is usually the slowest and 
tends to determine the time of discharge from hospital. 
 2.  Patients who have had an allogenic transplant are at risk of GVHD. Th is risk is 
reduced if the HLA match is a highly compatible one (only one locus is mismatched).

Examination Medicine
Prophylaxis against GVHD with some combination of prednisone, methotrexate 
and cyclosporin is usual. Th e donor marrow may be treated to remove T cells to 
reduce the incidence of GVHD, but this increases the risk of graft rejection. Th e 
risk of GVHD is also increased by previous exposure to blood products and by 
previous pregnancy. 
 3.  Acute GVHD can occur even when the major HLA antigens match. It occurs by 
defi nition in the fi rst 3 months after transplant and is characterised by:
 •  diarrhoea 
 •  skin rash 
 •  liver function test changes. 
 Severe acute GVHD (generalised erythroderma or desquamation) reduces survival 
and requires aggressive treatment. It is usually treated with high doses of prednisone, 
antithymocyte globulin and monoclonal antibodies to T cells. Some centres use 
prophylactic GVHD treatment after transplant with methotrexate and tacrolimus 
or cyclosporin. Remember that the presence of some GVHD reduces the risk of 
tumour recurrence as a result of graft versus tumour activity. 
 4.  Chronic GVHD develops after 3 months and aff ects up to half of transplant recipients. 
Patients develop an autoimmune-like illness with sicca syndrome, arthritis, cholestasis 
and bronchiolitis obliterans. It is treated with immunosuppression. It is rare for it 
to persist for more than 3 years. 
 5.  Infection can be a problem at various times after transplant.
 a.  Bacterial infection is most common during the early period before the neutrophil 
count reaches normal levels. 
 b.  Fungal infection can become a problem within a week of transplant, can be 
challenging to treat and clearance of infection becomes faster upon neutrophil 
recovery. 
 c.  Pneumocystis jirovecii infection and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can occur 
within a week of transplant but are uncommon after 3 months. Interstitial 
pneumonitis occurs in up to 10% of patients. Th is is usually the result of CMV 
infection and is treated with supporting measures and ganciclovir. CMV-negative 
recipients should receive only CMV-negative blood products, and CMV-positive 
patients should receive prophylactic ganciclovir. 
 d.  Antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole or fl uconazole, PJP prophylaxis with 
co-trimaxazole, and CMV prophylaxis with ganciclovir are usually indicated for 
allogenic bone marrow transplant, 
 6.  Graft rejection is usually a result of the activity of functional host lymphocytes and 
is most common in patients who have not had their marrow ablated (e.g. those with 
aplastic anaemia). 
 7.  Recurrence of leukaemia may be treated with infusion of more donor T cells, although 
this increases GVHD. 
 8.  Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome occurs in up to 50% of patients. Most 
recover, but in severe cases treatment with tissue plasminogen activator may be 
indicated. Th e use of ursodeoxycholic acid may also diminish the incidence. 
 9.  Overall, autologous bone marrow transplant is associated with similar but less severe 
complications. GVHD, however, does not occur. Transplant-related mortality is 
much less, at 1%–2%. 
 10.  Th e prognosis varies with the indication for the treatment ( Table 8.25 ). In general, 
malignant conditions have a better prognosis when treated with bone marrow transplant 
as a primary or secondary therapy than when it is used only after all else has failed. 
Patients with non-malignant conditions can often be very successfully treated with

and wrists or wasting of the small muscles of the hands. ‘Turn your hands up the

and complete? Is there external rotation of the shoulder used to make up for limited 
supination? Test for grip strength: ‘Squeeze my fi ngers as hard as you can’. Test fi nger 
joints: ‘Touch the tip of each fi nger with your thumb’. 
 If the hands seem abnormal, ask the patient to perform some functional testing: 
doing up buttons, undoing jar lids, etc. 
 5.  Legs and hips – say ‘Lie down on the bed for me’. Look at leg length and, if suspicious, 
measure true leg length from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus 
and apparent length from the umbilicus to the medial malleolus. Test knee fl exion: 
‘Bend your knee and pull your foot up towards your bottom’. Meanwhile, put your 
hand on the patella and feel for crepitus. Test for osteoarthritis of the hip by internally 
rotating the hip. Flex the knee to 90° and move the foot laterally. Pain and limitation 
of movement occur early with osteoarthritis. 
 6.  Feet – look for arthritic changes especially at the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, 
bunions, swelling, calluses, etc. 
 Th e examination will have to be varied for very immobile patients, but with practice 
it can be performed rapidly.
 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What was your assessment of  this patient ’ s general mobility and ability to cope 
with normal activities? 
 2.  Did he or she have a normal gait? 
 3.  Could he or she get up easily from a chair? 
 4.  Did he or she need any walking aids? Were they adequate in your opinion? 
 Remember the patterns of joint involvement ( Table 9.1 ). 
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
 Th is is the most common of the infl ammatory arthritides and is a very common long 
case in which the diagnosis is usually straightforward and the patient has many physical 
signs. Th e peak incidence of the onset of rheumatoid arthritis is in the fourth decade 
of life and it is three times as common in women as in men. Th ere may be a family 
history and there is an association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4 (70%). 
 
 
236
Examination Medicine
 If left untreated, the disease leads to progressive and irreversible joint damage and 
deformity ( Fig. 9.1a ). Life expectancy is reduced by 10 years. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask when the diagnosis was made and whether diagnosis seems to have been delayed 
– the onset of RA in patients over the age of 60 is associated with a worse prognosis 
for those who are rheumatoid factor (RF) positive. Delay in diagnosis and treatment 
also leads to a worse outcome. 
 2.  Ask about the presenting features – most patients present with vague generalised 
symptoms, such as fatigue, anorexia and non-specifi c musculoskeletal pains; a minority 
present with obvious oligoarticular arthritis; a few present with severe constitutional 
symptoms and acute arthritis. Morning stiff ness that lasts for more than an hour 
and continues for more than 6 weeks is characteristic of infl ammatory arthritis, but 
not of osteoarthritis. 
 3.  Ask about the initial treatment. 
 4.  Ask about the disease progression and which joints have been involved. Th e lumbar 
spine is never involved and the distal interphalangeal joints are only rarely aff ected. 
Find out how active the disease is currently: number of painful joints, duration of 
morning stiff ness. 
 5.  Enquire about the alterations in treatment over time and any complications 
encountered. 
 6.  Ask about the non-articular features of the disease:
 a.  skin – Raynaud ’ s phenomenon, leg ulcers ( Fig. 9.1b ) 
 b.  eyes – dry eyes (and mouth; Sjögren ’ s syndrome), scleritis, episcleritis or scleromalacia 
perforans, cataracts (caused by steroids); iritis does not occur 
 c.  sore throat, hoarseness or neck pain – suspect cricoaryteroid joint disease
d. recurrent headaches at the base of the skull or arm – tingling from C1–2 subluxation 
(remember to tell the examiners you would like to see a lateral fl exion cervical 
spine X-ray)

 c.  methotrexate (MTX) is often used and has a number of side-eff ects that need to 
be monitored (hepatic and pulmonary toxicity, low white cell count and throm-

 i.  steroids. 
 8.  Ask about the major current problem – such as decreasing hand function, paraesthesiae, 
severe pain, etc. 
 9.  Find out about the current activity of the disease. Th is can be assessed historically 
by asking about the number of joints that have recently been involved with active 
synovitis, the severity and duration of early-morning stiff ness (very important), 
functional ability, changes in weight and the degree of systemic ill health. A severe 
course is more likely if there is the early appearance of rheumatoid nodules, an 
insidious onset and constitutional symptoms. 
 10.  Enquire about past medical history, especially regarding peptic ulceration, drug 
reactions or renal disease. 
 11.  Enquire about social background – ability to cope at home, ability to climb steps, 
independence in daily activities, ability to perform fi ne-motor activities, the work 
environment, availability of support services. Smoking is a risk factor for rheumatoid 
arthritis, particularly in developing anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) positive 
rheumatoid arthritis. Th e risk falls after smoking is stopped. 
 
 
239

 12.  Ask about a family history (fi rst-degree relatives) of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, 
blood clots, diabetes (type 1), thyroid disease and miscarriages. Other types of 
autoimmune disease may be present in close relatives. 
 The examination 
 A thorough general examination ( Table 9.2 ) is important. In addition to assessing for 
synovitis in  every joint, look particularly at the following:
 1.  general appearance – steroid complications, weight; remember that the pain arises 
mostly from the joint capsule and that acutely infl amed joints are held in the fl exed 
position to increase the volume of the capsule and reduce pain 
 2.  the hands – including vasculitis and hand function; the wrist joints are almost always 
aff ected 
 3.  the arms – the elbow and shoulder joints, rheumatoid nodules and axillary node 
enlargement 
 4.  the face – check the eyes for Sjögren ’ s syndrome, scleritis, episcleritis, scleromalacia 
perforans, cataracts, anaemia and signs of hyperviscosity in the fundi; enlarged 
parotid glands (Sjögren ’ s syndrome); the mouth (dryness, dental caries, ulcers); listen 
for a hoarse voice and palpate the temporomandibular joints (crepitus);  note: rheu-

 Differential diagnosis 
 Consider the diff erential diagnosis of a deforming symmetrical chronic polyarthropathy:
 1.  rheumatoid arthritis 
 2.  psoriatic arthropathy and other seronegative spondyloarthropathies 
 3.  chronic tophaceous gout (rarely symmetrical) 
 4.  primary generalised osteoarthritis 
 5.  SLE (usually but not always non-deforming). 
 Remember that the causes of arthritis plus nodules include:
 1.  rheumatoid arthritis (seropositive) 
 2.  SLE – rare 
 3.  rheumatic fever (Jaccoud ’ s arthritis) – very rare 
 4.  amyloid arthropathy (most usually in association with multiple myeloma).
 Note: gouty tophi and xanthoma may sometimes be confused. 
 Investigations 
 To support the diagnosis (remembering that this is primarily a clinical diagnosis; see 
 Table 9.3 ), investigations include:
 1.  serological tests 
 a.  rheumatoid factor – 70% of patients are seropositive; patients may at fi rst be 
seronegative and seroconvert later. ( Note: Most patients are RF positive if they 
have nodules or associated vasculitis; remember that more than 10% of well people 
over the age of 65 have RF and that it is commonly found in association with 
infections and other infl ammatory conditions, in relatives of patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis and transiently after some vaccinations.) 
 b.  anti-citrullinated cyclic peptide – this is more specifi c (97%); it is associated with 
a more severe disease course and erosive disease 
 2.  X-ray fi lms of involved joints – changes to look for are:
 a.  soft-tissue swelling 
 b.  symmetrical joint space narrowing (OA causes asymmetrical narrowing) ( Figs 9.2 
and  9.3 ) and erosions 
 c.  juxta-articular osteoporosis 
 d.  marginal joint erosions ( Fig. 9.4 ). 
 Investigations used to assess the activity of the disease include:
 1.  ESR or CRP – remember that the diff erential diagnosis of a raised ESR in rheumatoid 
arthritis includes:
 a.  active disease 
 b.  amyloidosis 
 
 
241
9 • The rheumatological long case
 c.  infection 
 d.  Sjögren ’ s syndrome 
 2.  haemoglobin measurement – the severity of normochromic anaemia usually correlates 
with activity 
 3.  anti-CCP, and RF titres 
 4.  the presence of progressive erosions on serial X-ray fi lms. 
 Treatment 
 1.  Remember that the aim of modern treatment is to induce complete remission of the 
disease by suppressing the infl ammatory process. Th is means early diagnosis and 
introduction of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Th e traditional 
DMARDs will control the disease eff ectively for many patients, but the newer biological

therapies allow many more patients to have the disease controlled. Th e general principles 
of treatment include:
 •  education 
 •  physiotherapy, including exercise and splinting of the joints to prevent deformity 
 •  occupational therapy 
 •  smoking cessation 
 •  rest of infl amed joints 
 •  drug treatment aimed at reducing pain and infl ammation (with aspirin, other 
NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors) and at preventing progression of the disease. Th e 
risk of gastrointestinal toxicity of the traditional NSAIDs (i.e. peptic ulceration) 
is reduced by the use of the COX-2 inhibitors; however, all can cause dyspepsia 
and renal disease (e.g. acute interstitial nephritis) and worsen renal function in 
patients with diabetic or atherosclerotic kidney disease; all NSAIDs are associated 
with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. If there is aspirin allergy, sodium 
salicylate is an alternative.

 Th ese medications have a slow onset of action (weeks for methotrexate to months 
for gold). Th ere is evidence that they can lead to healing of bone erosions. Monitoring 
should include:
 •  full blood count 
 •  urine testing for proteinuria 
 •  specifi c tests for certain drugs, such as liver function tests for methotrexate, or 
ophthalmological examination and assessment of visual fi elds for hydroxychloroquine. 
 3.  Methotrexate is the most commonly used of these drugs; it can be given orally or 
intramuscularly, usually 10–25 mg weekly, but starting with a low dose. It is usually 
better tolerated than the other DMARDs and is often the drug of fi rst choice and 
given early in the course of the disease to decrease infl ammation and sometimes the 
development of synovitis. MTX may sometimes cause an increase in the number of 
rheumatoid nodules. It can be given alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine 
and sulfasalazine. Folic acid is given daily to decrease the risk of side-eff ects of MTX, 
especially mouth ulcers. Safety monitoring includes full blood count and liver function 
tests. Adverse reactions include rash, abnormal liver function tests (transaminases), 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and interstitial lung disease. It should not be given 
to patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi ciency.

 4.  Alternative agents in use include lefl unomide (a pyrimidine antagonist that inhibits 
the proliferation of T cells). 
 5.  Th e biological agents are generally second-line treatments because of their cost, but 
their use has increased greatly recently.  Table 9.5 shows the current prescribing rules 
for these drugs, while  Table 9.6 lists their side-eff ects and precautions for their use.

 1.  Local reactions at injection sites (usually mild) 
 2.  Infusion reactions – nausea, ﬂ ushing, headache or palpitations (often well managed with 
antihistamines) 
 3.  Delayed infusion reactions – fatigue, rash, arthralgia and myalgia (may require steroid use or cessation 
of treatment) 
 4.  Increased risk of serious infections – patients should avoid undercooked eggs and meat ( Listeria and 
 Salmonella organisms) 
 5.  Reactivation of TB (screen for TB before use – Mantoux, interferon gamma (IFN- γ ), chest X-ray)

 5.  Golimumab: SC injection 50 mg every 4th week (with MTX) 
 MTX  = methotrexate; TNF  = tumour necrosis factor. 
 Th ere are two main types of biological agents: the TNF (tumour necrosis factor) 
inhibitors and the non-TNF inhibitors. 
 THE TNF INHIBITORS 
 Th ese drugs block the activation of TNF- α , which is an infl ammatory cytokine found 
in the synovium of RA patients. Suppression of synovitis with these agents can almost 
completely prevent joint and bone destruction. All the TNF inhibitors have to be given 
by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection. Th e fi ve drugs currently available 
( Table 9.7 ) are equally eff ective and can be used in combination with methotrexate. 
Failure to respond occurs in 30% of patients and for them it is worth trying another 
drug in the same class or a non-TNF inhibitor.

Examination Medicine
 THE NON-TNF INHIBITORS 
 Th ese DMARDs inhibit proinfl ammatory cytokines other than TNF (see  Table 9.8 for 
a list of currently available drugs).

effective than the other drugs in this class 
 3.  Rituximab: antibody against CD20 B cell antigen; two 1000 mg IV infusions 2 weeks apart (infusion

 PREGNANCY AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS 
 Th e disease tends to abate during pregnancy but, in order to reduce the risk of fetal 
toxicity and assist conception, some drugs should be adjusted:
 •  Methotrexate should be stopped 3 months before conception. 
 •  Lefl unomide should be stopped until it is no longer detectable in the serum. 
 •  Sulfasalazine can cause reversible oligospermia and men should stop this 3 months 
before attempted conception. 
 •  Aspirin and NSAIDs can interfere with implantation; they can be used in the second 
trimester, but later in pregnancy can cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus 
and interfere with labour. 
 •  Steroids increase the risk of maternal diabetes and cleft palate in the baby. 
 •  Th e safety of biological agents is uncertain. 
 •  Methotrexate should not be used by breastfeeding mothers. 
 •  NSAIDs and low-dose steroids are considered safe for breastfeeding mothers.

 Osteoarthritis 
 Th is common problem will aff ect many long-case patients. It may not be the main 
medical problem, but it may be one that aff ects the patient ’ s life severely. It aff ects 80% 
of people over 55 years of age, and 95% of people over 65. Osteoarthritis is associated 
with obesity and diabetes ( Table 9.10 ) and may be one of the reasons a patient cannot 
exercise and lose weight. It should be possible from the history and examination to 
distinguish this from an infl ammatory arthritis, although many patients may have both. 
 Osteoarthritis involves synovial joints. Weight-bearing joints (the hip and the knee) 
and the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the 
hands and the fi rst MTP joint of the foot are most often aff ected ( Fig. 9.5 ). Th ere is 
usually loss of articular cartilage, meniscal damage, laxity of surrounding ligaments, 
formation of osteophytes and changes to subchondral bone. 
 Generalised nodal OA is particularly common in women and is characterised by the 
presence of Heberden ’ s (DIP) and Bouchard ’ s (PIP) nodes. Th ese are posterolateral 
swellings on the sides of the fi nger extensor tendons. Th ey gradually harden. Th ere is 
often a period when the nodes are developing when the joints are painful, but this 
usually resolves and hand function remains preserved. Th e condition is genetic. A woman 
has a 1 in 3 chance of developing the condition if her mother has been aff ected. Th e 
characteristics of the condition are set out in  Box 9.2 . 
 Table 9.10   Risk factors for osteoarthritis 
 • 
 Family history and genetics – especially knee and hip 
 • 
 Developmental problems: hip dysplasia, slipped femoral epiphysis 
 • 
 Repetitive loading: athletes, manual workers, squatting (knee arthritis in Indian and Asian populations) 
 • 
 Biomechanical problems: Paget ’ s disease, ligament rupture, menisectomy 
 • 
 Obesity (mechanical and possibly related to release of cytokines from adipose tissue) 
 • 
 Trauma 
 • 
 Hormonal: aromatase inhibitors, oestrogen deﬁ ciency

9 • The rheumatological long case
 KNEE OA 
 Arthritis begins in the patella–femoral and medial–tibiofemoral compartments and spreads 
to involve the whole knee. Patients feel pain in the medal or anterior aspect of the knee 
and down into the tibia, especially when they walk up or down stairs, or get out of a 
chair or car. Bending to put on shoes can be diffi  cult. Posterior knee pain suggests a 
complicating Baker ’ s cyst. 
 HIP OA 
 Th e superior aspect of the joint is most often aff ected. It is quite often unilateral. 
Migration of the femoral head in a superolateral direction may occur and indicates a 
poor prognosis. Medial OA of the joint is less common, has a better prognosis, is usually 
bilateral and more often aff ects women. 
 Hip pain is usually felt deep in the anterior part of the groin. Radiation to the 
anterolateral thigh, the knee, shin or buttock is variable. Secondary trochanteric bursitis 
may occur and is suggested by lateral pain, worse when the patient lies on that side. 
Th e same activities that exacerbate knee pain aff ect the hip. Th e common examination 
fi ndings are shown in  Box 9.3 . 
 OA OF THE SPINE 
 Th e cervical and lumbar areas of the spine are most involved (cervical and lumbar 
spondylosis). Pain is felt in the lower back or neck but can radiate to the arms, buttocks 
or legs if nerve root compression has occurred. Pain is better after rest and worse with 
movement. Th ere may be reduced movement of the spine and loss of lumbar lordosis. 
Th e straight leg-raising test may be abnormal. Neurological signs may be present in the 
arms and legs. 
 Box 9.2   Generalised nodal osteoarthritis 
 •  Interphalangeal joints affected 
 •  Heberden ’ s and Bouchard ’ s nodes 
 •  Joints enlarged, owing to osteophyte formation 
 •  Onset in middle age 
 •  Women more often affected 
 •  Usually good eventual function of hands 
 •  Increased risk of osteoarthritis of other joints, e.g. knees 
 Box 9.3   Examination ﬁ ndings – osteoarthritis of the hip 
 •  Antalgic gait (to avoid pain: spends less time in stance phase) 
 •  Gluteal and quadriceps wasting 
 •  Restriction and pain on internal rotation of the hip when it is ﬂ exed; this is the earliest 
and most sensitive ﬁ nding 
 •  Later all movements are restricted and there may be ﬁ xed ﬂ exion and external rotation 
deformity. 
 •  Tenderness of the anterior part of the groin lateral to the femoral pulse 
 •  Ipsilateral leg shortening may occur when the femoral head has migrated and there is 
severe joint space loss

 The history 
 Ask:
 1.  How long has the arthritis been a problem? (See  Box 9.4 .) 
 2.  Has there been swelling or infl ammation of the joints (suggesting an infl ammatory 
arthritis rather than osteoarthritis)? 
 3.  What joints have been involved? – the DIP, shoulders, hips, knees and proximal 
MCP joints are often aff ected. 
 4.  Are the joints stiff  in the morning? – patients with osteoarthritis do not have much 
morning stiff ness. 
 5.  Is there a family history? 
 6.  Have there been injuries to the joints (e.g. from playing sport)? 
 7.  Has the patient been able to lose weight? 
 8.  What limitations are there with respect to mobility and exercise? 
 9.  Are walking sticks or frames needed? 
 10.  How does the patient manage around the house – ADLs, etc.? 
 11.  Is he or she able to drive or work? 
 12.  What treatment has been tried – drug treatment, joint injections, exercise and 
physiotherapy, alternative treatments, surgery, weight loss? 
 13.  What drugs have been used? 
 14.  Have there been side-eff ects, especially from NSAIDs? 
 15.  Have these treatments helped? 
 The examination ( Box 9.5 ) 
 1.  Examine the joints that have been giving the patient problems. 
 2.  Look for deformity, loss of range of movement, ligamentous laxity, scars from previous 
surgery, and joint pain on movement. 
 3.  Test joint function (e.g. by getting the patient to walk, use their hands, etc.). 
 4.  Look at the eff ectiveness of walking aids. 
 Management 
 NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL 
 Many treatments will probably have been tried, but consider:
 1.  exercise:
 a.  stretching and mobility exercises can help maintain joint range of motion 
 b.  aquatic exercise may be possible for patients with severe restriction 
 
 
251
9 • The rheumatological long case
 c.  an exercise bicycle so that exercise is not weight-bearing 
 d.  supervised or group exercise works better for reduction of pain than independent 
exercise at home 
 2.  use of mobility aids:
 a.  a stick used in the opposite hand 
 b.  knee braces and foot orthoses 
 3.  loss of weight – this is the most important modifi able risk factor for osteoarthritis. 
A 10% loss of weight achieved by diet and exercise has been shown to reduce symptoms 
by 50%. 
 DRUG TREATMENT 
 1.  NSAIDs are the usual fi rst-line treatment. Th ey are probably somewhat more eff ective 
than paracetamol, but at the expense of their well-known gastrointestinal and cardio-
vascular side-eff ects. Using a proton pump inhibitor with a NSAID reduces GI 
bleeding risk in older patients ( ≥ 60 years) or those with a history of peptic ulcer. 
Th ere is no good information about the optimal duration of treatment. 
 2.  Paracetamol (up to 4 g / day) has been a common choice for osteoarthritis because 
of concerns about NSAID side-eff ects. Th ere is not much evidence, however, that it 
is more eff ective than placebo, especially for knee pain, and there have been concerns 
about acute liver failure with large doses ( > 4 g daily). 
 3.  Topical NSAIDs have been shown to be useful for knee and hand arthritis and seem 
safer than oral NSAIDs. Topical capsaicin can be a useful adjunct. 
 4.  Intra-articular injections of steroids give 1–2 weeks of relief and improve mobility. 
Th ey are useful for acute exacerbations. Frequent use can cause cartilage and joint 
damage and involve some risk of infection. 
 5.  Opioids can be given topically or orally and are more eff ective than placebo for knee 
arthritis, but the benefi ts are modest. Th eir use is associated with more adverse events 
than is the case with NSAIDs. Th ese include cardiovascular events, fractures and an 
increased mortality. 
 6.  Duloxetine is a centrally acting serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It has been shown to 
be superior to placebo and can be used in combination with NSAIDs. 
 SURGERY 
 Joint replacement can be very helpful when other treatment has failed. Arthroscopic 
procedures have not been shown to be eff ective for knee arthritis beyond what medical 
treatment can achieve. 
 COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINES 
 1.  Th e most commonly used of these drugs is glucosamine. It seems no more eff ective 
than placebo in controlled trials.

 •  enteropathic arthritis and spondylitis 
 •  juvenile-onset spondyloarthritis. 
 Th e axial skeleton, peripheral joints and extra-articular structures are aff ected ( Fig. 9.6 ). 
 In some populations, 90% of patients are HLA-B27 positive. Between 1% and 6% 
of people with HLA-B27 have the disease.

9 • The rheumatological long case
 Ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed when sacroiliitis is present on X ray in a patient 
with other features of axial spondyloarthritis. 
 It aff ects men two to three times as often as women and rarely begins after the age 
of 45 – the median age of diagnosis is 23. 
 The history 
 Th e patient will be likely to know the diagnosis. Ask:
 1.  Th e age of diagnosis and symptoms leading up to the diagnosis:
 •  Lower aching back pain with some hours of morning stiff ness is common. Pain 
tends to occur over the lower back, buttocks and posterior thighs. 
 •  Nocturnal exacerbation is often a feature of ankylosing spondylitis. 
 •  Th ere may be tenderness over bony processes including the spinous processes, 
ischial tuberosities, iliac crests, greater trochanters, costochondral junctions and 
heels. 
 •  Th irty per cent of patients develop hip and shoulder pain. 
 •  Asymmetrical peripheral joint involvement occurs in a similar proportion. 
 2.  How was the diagnosis made – X-rays, MRI, or HLA assessment (see  Table 9.11 )? 
 3.  What treatment has been used? Find out:
 •  which drugs, if any, have been used 
 •  whether they have helped with symptoms 
 •  whether the patient knows if radiological and serological test results have improved 
 •  whether there have been problems with side-eff ects (see  Table 9.6 ) 
 •  whether joint surgery has been required (e.g. hip replacement) 
 •  whether other manifestations of the disease required treatment (e.g. uveitis and 
topical steroids). 
 4.  How has this debilitating disease aff ected the patient ’ s ability to work, exercise and 
perform ADLs? What symptoms are present at the moment? How limited is the 
patient by these? 
 5.  How is the treatment being monitored? 
 6.  Have there been features of reactive arthritis – urethritis, conjunctivitis? 
 7.  Has the patient any psoriasis? 
 8.  Has there been a diagnosis of infl ammatory bowel disease? 
 Table 9.11   Diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (SPA) 
 1.  Age less than 45 
 2.  ≥ 3 months of back pain 
 3.  HLA-B27 plus two or more of:
 • 
 inﬂ ammatory back pain 
 • 
 heel pain (enthesitis) 
 • 
 uveitis 
 • 
 dactylitis (diffuse swelling of digits – toes or ﬁ ngers) 
 • 
 inﬂ ammatory bowel disease 
 • 
 family history of SPA or HLA-B27 
 • 
 elevated CRP 
 • 
 response to NSAIDs 
 4.  Sacroiliitis on X-ray or MRI a 
 a MRI shows three or more corner inﬂ ammatory lesions in two slices or more. 
 CRP  = C-reactive protein. 
 
 
254
Examination Medicine
 9.  Has there been testing for HIV infection? Reactive arthritis and psoriatic arthritis 
exacerbations are associated with HIV infection. 
 10.  Were the symptoms preceded by gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections? Reactive 
arthritis is often preceded by such infections. 
 11.  Th e extra-articular manifestations include:
 •  uveitis (40%) 
 •  fatigue and anaemia 
 •  prostatitis and sterile urethritis 
 •  aortic regurgitation (20%) 
 •  osteoporosis 
 •  symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (late) 
 •  upper lobe interstitial lung disease (late and rare). 
 Diagnosis 
 Persistent back pain in a young person that is worse at night should suggest the diagnosis. 
Th e presence of associated features and raised infl ammatory markers makes the diagnosis 
more likely ( Table 9.11 ). Th e most important diff erential diagnosis is malignancy. 
 Find out whether the patient knows the results of any of these investigations. 
 The examination 
 Examine the patient as set out for the short-case ankylosing spondylitis ( p. 513 ). 
 Management 
 1.  An exercise program is usually recommended to help the patient maintain 
fl exibility. 
 2.  Non-steroidal anti-infl ammatories have been shown to relieve symptoms and slow 
radiographic progression. 
 3.  For the many patients who progress despite this treatment, anti-TNF- α treatment 
with infl iximab or etanercept has been very successful in improving symptoms and 
markers of disease activity. Even patients with severe deformity have obtained improve-
ment. Th e doses used are similar to those used for rheumatoid arthritis. 
 4.  Find out what drugs have been used, whether they helped symptoms, any side-eff ects, 
if joint surgery is being considered, and how the disease is aff ecting the patient ’ s life 
(and family). 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What precautions and advice would you give  this patient before starting anti-TNF- α 
treatment? 
 2.  What is your assessment of  this patient ’ s functional state? 
 Systemic lupus erythematosus 
 Th is multisystem disorder occurs usually in patients between 20 and 40 years of age.
 •  Women are more often aff ected than men (8 : 1) and there is an increased incidence 
in families (monozygotic twins have a 50% concordance). 
 •  Th ere are associations with HLA-DR2, with HLA-DR3, and with homozygous 
defi ciencies of the early components of complement. 
 
 
255
9 • The rheumatological long case
 •  It presents diagnostic as well as long-term management problems. Th e diagnosis 
requires at least four of the 11 published criteria either currently or in the past 
( Table 9.12 ). Fewer than four criteria are often labelled ‘possible lupus’. Non-specifi c 
positive autoimmune tests with some evidence of infl ammation can be referred to as 
‘undiff erentiated connective tissue disease’. 
 Table 9.12   American Rheumatism Association criteria for SLE 
 1.  Malar rash – sparing the nasolabial folds 
 2.  Discoid rash 
 3.  Photosensitivity rash 
 4.  Oral ulcers 
 5.  Arthritis – non-erosive and affecting two or more peripheral joints 
 6.  Serositis – pleurisy or pericarditis, with audible rub, effusion or ECG changes 
 7.  Renal disorder – persistent proteinuria  > 0.5 g / day or cellular casts 
 8.  Neurological disorder – seizures or psychosis not related to drugs or metabolic abnormalities 
 9.  Haematological disorder – haemolytic anaemia, leukopenia ( < 4000 /  μ L), lymphopenia ( < 2000 /  μ L), 
thrombocytopenia ( < 100,000 /  μ L) 
 10.  Immunological disorder – anti-DNA antibodies in abnormal titre, or anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibody, or 
positive antiphospholipid antibodies 
 11.  Antinuclear antibody disorder – abnormal ANA titre  > 1 : 160 
 Note: Four or more manifestations of the 11 must be present serially or simultaneously. 
 ANA  = antinuclear antibody; SLE  = systemic lupus erythematosus. 
 HINT 
 A weakly positive ANA test (see below) is very common and should not be used to 
make a diagnosis of lupus (but it often is, so be careful about accepting the label). 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about the presenting symptoms ( Table 9.13 ):
 a.  general symptoms – malaise (nearly all patients), weight loss (60%), nausea and 
vomiting (50%), thrombosis of veins or arteries (15%) 
 b.  musculoskeletal symptoms (95%) – arthralgia, arthritis (typically symmetrical and 
non-erosive), myalgia and myositis 
 c.  dermatological symptoms (85%) – skin rash, alopecia, oral and nasal ulcers 
 d.  fever (77%) 
 e.  neuropsychiatric symptoms (60%) – delirium, dementia, convulsions, chorea, 
neuropathy, loss of vision (optic neuritis), stroke, headache, symptoms resembling 
multiple sclerosis, anxiety and depression 
 f.  renal tract symptoms (50%) – haematuria, oedema, chronic kidney disease (just 
about any type of glomerulonephritis) 
 g.  respiratory tract symptoms (45%) – pleurisy 
 h.  cardiovascular symptoms (40%) – pericarditis, myocarditis, valvular lesions, premature 
coronary artery disease (increased atherosclerosis) 
 i.  haematological symptoms (50%) – lymphadenopathy, anaemia 
 j.  gastrointestinal symptoms (30%) – nausea, diarrhoea, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, 
perforation 
 
 
256
Examination Medicine
 k.  thrombophlebitis, recurrent abortions or fetal death in utero (suggests antiphos-
pholipid syndrome) 
 l.  sicca symptoms (secondary to Sjögren ’ s syndrome) 
 m.  diffi  culties with activities of daily living and ability to work as a result of the eff ect 
of this chronic and relapsing disease on the patient ’ s life. 
 2.  Ask about any drug history (e.g. procainamide, hydralazine – causes of an SLE-like 
syndrome) ( Table 9.14 ). Remember, newer antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive drugs 
have made classical drug-induced lupus less common and typically the symptoms 
resolve rapidly with cessation of the drug; autoantibody levels (anti-histone) diminish 
slowly. Anti-TNF drugs can also cause a lupus-like syndrome with a positive ANA 
and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA); minocycline and hydralazine do this 
too, but with these drugs ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) is positive 
as well. 
 3.  Ask about any treatment given and any complications of treatment. 
 4.  Ask about problems during pregnancy and use of contraception. Pregnancy is especially 
risky if the disease is active. Progesterone or low-dose oestrogen contraception is 
advisable. 
 5.  Ask about protection from sunlight. Th is reduces the risk of photosensitivity rashes 
and fl ares of systemic disease. 
 6.  Enquire about the family history. 
 7.  Enquire about the patient ’ s understanding of the implications of this chronic and 
incurable disease and its prognosis. Remember, though, that current treatment allows 
a 90% 10-year survival rate compared with 50% 30 years ago.

 Note: There is an increased incidence of drug-induced lupus in slow acetylators who will develop a positive 
ANA and clinical manifestations sooner than rapid acetylators. Drug-induced lupus is more common in 
the elderly because of the more frequent use of drugs in this group. There is usually no renal or nervous 
system disease, no antibody to dsDNA and improvement may occur if the drug is withdrawn.

 The examination ( Table 9.15 ) 
 1.  Inspect the patient for weight loss and Cushingoid appearance (because of steroid 
treatment) and assess the patient ’ s general mental state. 
 2.  Examine all the skin for a classical malar rash ( Fig. 9.7 ), a discoid erythematous 
raised rash ( Fig. 9.8 ) or a photosensitivity rash. 
 Remember that discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) occurs in 20% of SLE patients.

circular erythematous lesions and follicular plugging. Th ere is often destruction of 
skin appendages. DLE can occur without other features of SLE. 
 3.  Look at the hands for vasculitis, which can produce nail-fold infarcts and ischaemia 
or gangrene, and rash (e.g. photosensitivity, diff use maculopapular rash). 
 4.  Look for Raynaud ’ s phenomenon and arthropathy (fusiform swelling of the PIP 
joints or synovitis, possibly in a rheumatoid arthritis distribution – 10% develop 
swan-neck deformity and ulnar deviation of the fi ngers). Th is non-erosive arthropathy 
is referred to as Jaccoud ’ s arthritis. 
 5.  Look at the forearms for livedo reticularis and purpura as a result of vasculitis or 
thrombocytopenia. Test for proximal myopathy caused by actual disease or secondary 
to steroid treatment. 
 6.  Inspect the head. Look for alopecia. Lupus hairs are characteristic: they occur above 
the forehead and are short, broken hairs that grow back quickly after hair loss (except 
in patients with DLE). 
 7.  Look at the eyes for keratoconjunctivitis sicca and for pale conjunctivae due to 
anaemia, and look at the fundi for cytoid lesions (hard exudates secondary to vasculitis) 
( Fig. 9.9 ). 
 8.  Look in the mouth for ulcers and infection. Note any facial rash (butterfl y photo-
sensitivity rash (30%), discoid lupus or diff use maculopapular rashes). Feel the cervical 
and axillary nodes. 
 9.  Examine the chest. In the cardiovascular system, note signs of pericarditis or murmurs. 
(Libman–Sacks endocarditis is a very uncommon cause of clinical signs.) 
 10.  In the respiratory system, note signs of pleural eff usion, pleuritis, interstitial lung 
disease or atelectasis. 
 11.  Examine the abdomen for splenomegaly (usually mild) and hepatomegaly. Feel for 
abdominal tenderness. 
 12.  Examine the hips for signs of aseptic necrosis. 
 13.  Examine for proximal weakness in the legs, cerebellar ataxia, hemiplegia and transverse 
myelitis. Assess mental status (cognitive changes, even psychosis).

9 • The rheumatological long case
 14.  Also examine for neuropathy (mainly sensory) and mononeuritis multiplex, as well 
as thrombophlebitis and leg ulceration. 
 15.  Look at the urine analysis for evidence of renal disease (haematuria and proteinuria). 
 16.  Take the blood pressure (it may be elevated in renal disease). Also, look at the 
temperature chart for fever, indicating active disease or secondary infection. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Diagnosis depends on a combination of the symptoms, signs and laboratory test 
results (see  Tables 9.12 and 9.16 ). Almost all cases are ANA positive, which is a 
very sensitive but not specifi c test (if ANA is negative, check for Sjögren ’ s syn-
drome A / B (SSA / SSB) antibodies). Very specifi c tests for SLE are anti-dsDNA 
(including titre, 100% specifi c) and anti-Smith (anti-Sm – positive virtually only 
in SLE). 
 2.  Patients who do not fi t the criteria may have another connective tissue disease. 
Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is suggested by the overlapping clinical 
features of scleroderma, polymyositis and SLE and the presence of characteristic 
antibodies to nuclear ribonucleoprotein (nRNP), which is one of the extractable 
nuclear antigens. Anti-nRNP is present in high titre and produces a speckled pattern 
on fl uorescent antibody testing in patients with MCTD. When these patients are 
followed for many years, they may start to resemble patients with progressive systemic 
sclerosis or SLE, or may continue with a relatively undiff erentiated connective tissue 
disease.

9 • The rheumatological long case
 3.  MRI scans and lumbar puncture (increased protein and mononuclear cells) may be 
indicated if central nervous system lupus is suspected. Central nervous system symptoms 
often correlate poorly with serological measures of the activity of the disease. Do not 
miss bacterial meningitis in SLE. 
 4.  Haematological tests:
 a.  Anaemia – normochromic, normocytic and related to the chronic infl ammatory 
processes – is very common. Immune haemolytic anaemia is less common and the 
Coombs’ test then gives a positive result. 
 b.  Th e ESR tends to be elevated but the CRP is often normal, except during episodes 
of serositis. 
 c.  Leukopenia (especially lymphopenia) occurs in over half the patients and may be 
caused by antibody directed against leukocytes. 
 d.  Th e lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, or both, are found in about 
10% of cases. Characteristically, there is a prolonged partial thromboplastin time 
with kaolin (PTTK), which is not corrected by the addition of normal plasma. It 
is associated with thrombosis rather than bleeding. 
 e.  Th rombocytopenia occurs in 15% of cases and is associated with anti-platelet 
antibodies. 
 5.  Immunological tests:
 a.  Th e characteristic abnormalities are the presence of autoantibodies (see  Table 9.16 ). 
ANAs are present in 99% of cases and are usually detectable from the time of onset 
of symptoms. Th e antigens involved include ssDNA and dsDNA, SSA and SSB, 
and Sm antigen (an acidic nuclear protein). Many antibodies persist even when the 
disease is quiescent. Antibodies to dsDNA and Sm are the most specifi c for SLE and 
are therefore the most useful diagnostically. Th e latter, however, is not very sensitive. 
 b.  Complement abnormalities are usual during exacerbations of the disease, with a 
reduction in total haemolytic complement (CH50) and in the components of the 
classical pathway (C3 and C4). Th e combination of a low CH50 and normal C3 
suggests an inherited defi ciency of complement components and is strongly associated 
with SLE. Th e fi nding of high levels of anti-dsDNA and lower complement levels 
is usually associated with active disease and especially renal involvement. 
 c.  Positive RF occurs in 10% of cases at low titre. Skin biopsy in SLE can be helpful; 
positive immunofl uorescence of the basement membrane in involved skin occurs 
in 95% of patients. 
 Treatment 
 Current work suggests that appropriate treatment to suppress exacerbations of SLE will 
prolong life. Many patients have mild disease without life-threatening complications. 
Th e prognosis of SLE is generally good. Th ere is a 90% 10-year survival rate; the major 
causes of death are infections, renal failure, lymphoma and myocardial infarction.
 1.  Arthralgias, myalgia and fever respond to rest and NSAIDs. 
 2.  Exposure to sunlight should be avoided and sunscreen used. 
 3.  Hydroxychloroquine is very eff ective for skin and joint manifestations, reduces the 
risk of renal involvement and improves survival. Annual retinal and visual fi eld 
examinations must be performed in patients on this drug because of the cumulative 
risk of retinal toxicity. Although it is a category D drug, it is often used in pregnancy, 
where its benefi ts outweigh the risks. 
 4.  Raynaud ’ s phenomenon may respond to calcium channel antagonists. 
 5.  Steroids are indicated for central nervous system involvement, pericarditis, myocarditis, 
pleurisy, severe haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Use of high initial doses 
 
 
262
Examination Medicine
with gradual reduction once improvement occurs is the proper method of 
treatment. 
 6.  Hypercoagulability (thrombotic episodes and antiphospholipid antibodies) should 
be treated with warfarin for life, with a target INR of 2.5–3. 
 7.  Management of renal disease is diffi  cult. Renal biopsy usually shows abnormalities, 
but often only mild changes. Virtually any type of glomerulonephritis may occur. 
Renal biopsy is indicated early on if there is any clinical or biochemical evidence of 
renal disease or if the urine sediment is abnormal. Four main groups of biopsy 
abnormalities can be identifi ed:
 •  mesangial proliferation 
 •  focal glomerulonephritis 
 •  diff use proliferation 
 •  membranous proliferation. 
 Mesangial proliferation has the best prognosis – disease is unlikely to progress. 
Diff use proliferative glomerulonephritis has the worst prognosis and aggressive 
treatment (e.g. high-dose pulse steroids plus cyclophosphamide) is recommended. 
Membranous proliferation has a low rate of response to treatment. SLE is not a 
contraindication to dialysis or renal transplant in those patients who develop chronic 
kidney disease, but there is a higher than average risk of graft failure. 
 8.  Calcium and vitamin D supplements should be off ered to protect against osteoporosis. 
Bisphosphonates should be considered if long-term steroid treatment is likely. 
 9.  Azathioprine is indicated as a steroid-sparing agent. Methotrexate can also be used, 
particularly if arthritis is prominent. 
 Cyclophosphamide is a more toxic alternative. Intermittent pulses of cyclo-
phosphamide may be helpful. Th ese agents are particularly indicated in active 
glomerulonephritis. 
 10.  Mycophenolate is now accepted in treatment guidelines as a less toxic alternative to 
cyclophosphamide in the treatment of renal lupus. A number of new biological 
agents are being tested in clinical trials. Autologous stem cell transplant is also an 
experimental treatment. 
 11.  Anti-B cell treatment has been used for SLE. Rituximab and belimumab have shown 
modest effi  cacy. Th ey are currently available under special access schemes. A few 
patients have a dramatic response to these drugs. 
 12.  Exacerbations of lupus may occur in pregnancy and postpartum.
 •  Hydroxychloroquine should be continued throughout pregnancy as there are 
better outcomes for mother and baby . 
 •  Spontaneous abortions are common in women with antiphospholipid antibodies. 
Treatment with anticoagulation (heparin plus low-dose aspirin – never prescribe 
warfarin) may be eff ective in reducing the risk of abortion. 
 •  Steroids may be used in pregnancy because, except for dexamethasone, these do 
not cross the placenta. 
 •  Women with the anti-Ro (SSA / SSB) antibody may have babies with permanent 
complete heart block and transient erythematous rashes. 
 •  Cervical dysplasia is common and women younger than 26 years should be off ered 
human papilloma virus vaccine. 
 13.  Improved survival has meant that cardiovascular complications are now the most 
common cause of death. Th is is probably due to the chronic infl ammation associated 
with the disease. Aggressive control of cardiovascular risk factors and particularly 
avoidance of smoking is very important. 
 Th e risk of lymphoma is also increased and screening may be indicated.

Examination Medicine
 •  bloody nasal discharge 
 •  cough (which is initially a dry cough, but may evolve into haemoptysis) 
 •  breathlessness. 
 2.  Giant cell arteritis: patients are generally in the sixth–eighth decade of life. About 
20% of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica develop giant cell arteritis. Th e usual 
specifi c symptoms are:
 •  severe bitemporal headache 
 •  less commonly, visual disturbance (e.g. diplopia) or visual loss 
 •  jaw claudication (quite specifi c), scalp tenderness or occasionally tongue claudication. 
Other focal neurological symptoms can also occur. 
 3.  Polyarteritis nodosa (medium-sized arteries): the specifi c symptoms depend on which 
arteries are involved – coronary arteries, mesenteric arteries or renal arteries. Suspect this 
possibility if there are multiple systems involved (e.g. foot drop – vasculitis of the vasa 
nervorum – with chest and abdominal pain). Skin changes include ulceration, palpable 
purpura and infarction. Severe hypertension may result from renal involvement. Ask 
about risk factors for hepatitis B (recently acquired in one-third of cases). Th e peak 
incidence is between 40 and 50 years and men are twice as often aff ected as women. 
 4.  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) (small vessels causing a 
pulmonary–renal syndrome): this is the new name for Churg–Strauss vasculitis; patients 
almost invariably have asthma fi rst, then a peripheral eosinophilia. Ask about a previous 
history of:
 •  asthma 
 •  allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps 
 •  eczema 
 •  cough and breathlessness 
 •  peripheral nervous system disease, in the form of either symmetrical peripheral 
neuropathy or mononeuritis multiplex 
 •  serositis leading to pleural and pericardial eff usions. 
 5.  Microscopic polyarteritis (polyangiitis) (small vessels causing a pulmonary–renal 
syndrome): the major problem is usually with renal impairment and lung disease, 
which may not have any specifi c symptoms. Systemic symptoms of vasculitis are 
generally very prominent. 
 6.  Mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia (small vessels are aff ected – due to rheumatoid 
factor bound to IgG): patients present with:
 •  palpable purpura of the extremities 
 •  Raynaud ’ s disease 
 •  arthritis 
 •  neuropathy. 
 Hepatitis C is common. 
 The examination 
 1.  Th e patient with systemic vasculitis usually looks unwell. Check for fever, sinus 
tachycardia, pallor and signs of recent weight loss. 
 2.  Look for livedo reticularis (a net-like pattern –  Fig. 9.10 ). Th e diff erential diagnosis 
includes cholesterol atheroembolism after a vascular procedure, antiphospholipid 
syndrome and vasculitis. Other mimics of vasculitis include atrial myxoma, bacterial 
endocarditis and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). 
 3.  Other physical signs will be more specifi c to the actual underlying illness:
 •  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: look for the classical collapse of the nasal septum 
(a saddle-shaped nose ( Fig. 9.11 ), which also occurs in relapsing polychondritis).

Examination Medicine
Th ere may be evidence of tachypnoea and crackles throughout the lung fi eld. Fluid 
overload may occur in the setting of worsening chronic kidney disease. 
 •  Giant cell arteritis: tender and indurated temporal arteries will often be present. 
Th ere may be abnormal eye signs if there is retinal involvement. Focal neurological 
signs should be sought. 
 •  Polyarteritis nodosa: there may be evidence of painful skin nodules in rare cases, 
as well as palpable purpura and livedo reticularis. Look for mononeuritis multiplex. 
 •  EGPA: look for signs of allergic disease, such as swollen nasal turbinates, nasal 
polyps and evidence of bronchospasm. Examine the peripheral nervous system 
carefully, looking for single nerve lesions or symmetrical peripheral neuropathy 
generally aff ecting the lower limbs. 
 •  Microscopic polyarteritis: urinalysis is the key – look for any evidence of proteinuria 
or haematuria. 
 •  Mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia: look for Raynaud ’ s disease, palpable purpura 
and peripheral neuropathy. Assess for signs of liver disease (hepatitis C). 
 Investigations 
 Investigations will be critical in determining the diagnosis in systemic vasculitis.
 1.  In most cases a biopsy of aff ected tissue is the most reliable way of making the 
diagnosis; other investigations will raise the suspicion that vasculitis is the problem 
and direct the clinician to a suitable biopsy site. 
 2.  It will often be necessary to exclude systemic infection, malignancy or generalised 
autoimmune disease. 
 3.  In vasculitis, the ESR is invariably raised, often at levels of  > 70 mm / h. Th ere is 
frequently a normochromic normocytic anaemia and there may be neutrophilia. 
Th e platelet count may be elevated. 
 4.  Renal function will often be impaired in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis 
nodosa and microscopic polyarteritis. 
 5.  Abnormal liver function tests, particularly elevated transaminase levels, may be found 
in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and in polyarteritis nodosa. Liver function 
abnormalities are also reported in giant cell arteritis. 
 6.  Urine abnormalities will often be found in the form of urinary casts and the presence 
of dysmorphic red blood cells in the urine, particularly in granulomatosis with poly-
angiitis, microscopic polyarteritis and polyarteritis nodosa. 
 7.  Th e chest X-ray will often show a bilateral diff use interstitial abnormality in granu-
lomatosis with polyangiitis (see  Fig. 16.31 ,  p. 458 ) and a peripheral fl uff y, patchy 
infi ltrative pattern in EGPA. 
 8.  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: the critical investigation is the antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA). Th is will be present in a vast majority of cases of 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Further testing of this antibody will reveal the 
presence of anti-pr3 antibodies. Th e presence of a typical clinical syndrome with a 
positive c-ANCA and pr3 antibodies is virtually diagnostic of granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis. Th e need for a tissue biopsy may be avoided if these tests are positive. 
Occasionally, patients with upper airways disease only will not have a positive 
c-ANCA test. 
 9.  Giant cell arteritis: diagnosis depends on a positive tissue sample. Treatment with 
steroids must not be delayed until a biopsy can be performed to make a defi nite 
diagnosis (the biopsy can be done within 2 weeks of starting steroids). Temporal 
artery biopsy should reveal the diagnosis as long as a generous biopsy is taken by 
the surgeon, but the artery on the other side may need to be sampled in some cases. 
 
 
267
9 • The rheumatological long case
 10.  Polyarteritis nodosa: tissue samples are often not available. Many organs may be 
involved ( Table 9.17 ). If symptoms or signs point this way, a biopsy of nerve, muscle 
or testis may be diagnostic; renal biopsy is not helpful. CT or MRI angiography is 
often helpful in this illness, particularly of the mesenteric arteries, hepatic and renal 
arteries but possibly also of the coronary arteries (CT rather than MRI). Bead-like 
aneurysmal dilatation of the arteries is suggestive of polyarteritis. 
 11.  EGPA: 50% of patients will have a positive perinuclear (p) ANCA test. Th e other 
important diagnostic tool is the tissue biopsy, which will reveal intense eosinophilia. 
Sural nerve biopsy will sometimes be required in the setting of neuropathy and this 
will show vasculitis. 
 12.  Microscopic polyarteritis: this is characterised by a positive p-ANCA result. Th is 
antibody is directed against myeloperoxidase. Renal biopsy is usually necessary to 
establish the diagnosis. 
 13.  p-ANCA is rare in other infl ammatory diseases, but common in patients with 
vasculitis (c-ANCA is specifi c for granulomatosis with polyangiitis). ANCA titres 
do not correspond with the clinical severity of the patient ’ s illness and they may 
be only markers of disease. Remember that p-ANCA tests may be positive, but 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) negative, in other conditions including infl ammatory bowel 
disease, autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, as well as in healthy 
individuals (5%). 
 Treatment 
 Systemic vasculitis will generally require aggressive immunosuppressive medication. 
Failure to suppress the vasculitis aggressively can result in permanent injury, progressive 
deterioration and death.
 1.  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (deadly if untreated): high-dose corticosteroids 
and daily oral cyclophosphamide should be instituted. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
is adjunctive therapy. Biological agents are being investigated for treatment of granu-
lomatosis with polyangiitis. Rituximab shows the most promise, but should not be 
used at this stage unless other agents have failed. 
 2.  Giant cell arteritis: high-dose oral corticosteroids are required, typically for 1–2 years. 
 3.  Polyarteritis nodosa: the untreated 5-year survival rate is less than 20%. A combination 
of high-dose prednisone and cyclophosphamide will usually be very eff ective (90%

long-term remission). Treatment may often be discontinued after remission is obtained 
and the long-term prognosis is very good. Interferon alpha, or the antiviral drug 
vidarabine, may help to induce remission if there is associated hepatitis B infection. 
 4.  EGPA: the eosinophilic vasculitis of the Churg–Strauss syndrome is generally very 
steroid responsive, but occasionally other cytotoxic agents need to be used. Steroids 
alone have been shown to increase the 5-year survival rate from 25% to 50%. 
 5.  Microscopic polyarteritis: corticosteroids combined with immunosuppressive agents 
are usually required, with renal support in patients who develop chronic kidney 
disease. 
 6.  Th e duration of treatment for all of these vasculitic illnesses needs to be individualised. 
Patients with giant cell arteritis can come off  treatment after about 2 years, but some 
have disease for several years. Most of the other diseases will require maintenance 
therapy. 
 7.  Patients often suff er the eff ects of long-term steroid therapy and immunosuppression, 
such as osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes and accelerated vascular disease. Prevention 
should be aggressively pursued. Infection (e.g.  Pneumocystis pneumonia) is common 
in this group and can be serious or fatal. 
 8.  Patients on cyclophosphamide need careful monitoring of their blood count and 
careful counselling to ensure adequate fl uid intake and avoid haemorrhagic cystitis. 
Th ey also deserve an annual urinalysis for haematuria once therapy is ceased; haematuria 
may indicate the development of bladder cancer. 
 Possible line of questioning 
 How would you monitor  this patient for problems with his or her drug treatment? 
 Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
 Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a disease that not infrequently requires patients 
to be admitted to hospital for its various complications. It may therefore crop up as a 
long case in the examination. Th e disease can be either primary or secondary. Th e secondary 
form is usually a complication of other autoimmune conditions and vasculitides, the 
most common of which are SLE and temporal arteritis. Th e main antibody in this 
disease is directed against the phospholipid–beta 2 -glycoprotein 1 complex, on which it 
exerts a procoagulant eff ect. It has also been described in HIV infection. 
 The history 
 Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome commonly suff er thrombosis 
( Table 9.18 ).
 1.  Ask about venous thromboses. Th e most common site is the deep lower limb or 
pelvic veins, but the axillary veins can be involved. 
 2.  Ask about arterial thromboses. Stroke and myocardial infarction are the most common 
arterial complications. 
 3.  Enquire about a history of recurrent fi rst-trimester and later abortion. Antiphospholipid 
antibody syndrome is far more common in females and otherwise unexplained fi rst-
trimester abortions are characteristic of this disease. Other obstetric complications 
include intrauterine growth retardation and an increased tendency for hypertension 
in pregnancy. 
 
 
269
9 • The rheumatological long case
 4.  Ask about bleeding problems associated with thrombocytopenia, skin changes (especially 
livedo reticularis), central nervous system complications such as migraine and chorea, 
and eclampsia or pre-eclampsia with the HELLP syndrome: 
 H aemolysis,  E levated  L iver enzymes,  L ow  P latelets. 
 5.  Ask about features of the underlying disorder, such as SLE, which suggest the patient 
has a secondary form of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. 
 The examination 
 Unless the patient has an active thrombosis, there are unlikely to be any abnormal 
physical signs. However, look especially for:
 1.  signs of any associated autoimmune diseases, particularly skin rashes and joint 
abnormalities in SLE, and dry eyes and mouth in Sjögren ’ s syndrome 
 2.  livedo reticularis rash on the lower limbs 
 3.  heart murmurs from sterile valve vegetations. 
 Investigations (see also  pp. 202–4 ) 
 1.  Th e detection of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies is diagnostic for the antiphospholipid 
antibody syndrome if the antibodies are in high titre and found in the correct clinical 
context. IgM anticardiolipin antibodies may be detected, although these are less 
specifi c. 
 2.  Th e lupus inhibitor is a related antibody (both are antibodies to phospholipid) that 
confers an even greater risk of thrombosis and pregnancy complications. Th e lupus 
inhibitor is also associated with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT) not corrected in a mixing study. 
 3.  Antibodies to beta 2 -glycoprotein 1 ( β 2 -GP 1) in high titre may be present in the 
appropriate clinical setting. 
 4.  In patients with suspected antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, it is worth checking 
the ANA and other autoimmune serology as indicated, as well as measuring the 
platelet count. Th e Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test may be falsely 
positive. 
 Treatment 
 1.  Any patient with thrombotic complications of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
should be considered for treatment with anticoagulants for life (consider whether the 
benefi ts exceed the risks for individual patients). 
 2.  Th e patient with anticardiolipin antibodies but no clinical abnormalities presents a 
diffi  cult clinical situation. Th ere are no data to support routine anticoagulation in 
this situation, but clearly there is a risk of arterial thrombosis. 
 Table 9.18   Clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
 1.  Cardiac – myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension 
 2.  Haematological – haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, migraine, epilepsy, transverse myelopathy 
 3.  Renal – renal vein thrombosis 
 4.  Endocrine – Addison ’ s disease (adrenal vein thrombosis) 
 5.  Neurological – cerebral ischaemia (stroke, multi-infarct dementia) 
 6.  Gastrointestinal – bowel ischaemia 
 7.  Obstetric – recurrent abortions, intrauterine growth retardation 
 8.  Dermatological – livedo reticularis, ulcers 
 
 
270
Examination Medicine
 3.  Th e patient who has had obstetric problems in the past but no history of thrombosis 
also presents a dilemma for clinicians. Th e literature supports the use of anticoagulation 
therapy only in those with anticardiolipin antibodies or lupus inhibitor in whom a 
thrombotic complication has previously occurred. 
 4.  Women who have suff ered recurrent abortion will require treatment during pregnancy. 
Low-molecular-weight heparin would normally be used throughout the pregnancy, 
with the addition of low-dose aspirin. Th ere is no good evidence that corticosteroids 
improve survival of the fetus. 
 Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) 
 Definitions 
 •  Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) is characterised by skin changes of the distal 
extremities and the face (70%). Th ese patients are usually anticentromere positive. 
 •  CREST is a subset of lcSSc. 
 •  Diff use cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) (30%) involves skin involvement proximal 
to the elbows and knees. Th ere is chest, abdominal or internal organ involvement. 
 Th is is a progressive disease of multiple organs. Although rare, it crops up commonly 
in examinations. It is more common in women than in men (5 : 1). Th e 5-year survival 
for dcSSc patients at diagnosis is only 70%. Asian patients have a higher incidence of 
diff use disease and of interstitial lung disease. Th ere is a slightly increased risk of disease 
for people who have a fi rst-degree relative aff ected. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about symptoms:
 a.  dermatological symptoms – Raynaud ’ s phenomenon (commonly the fi rst symptom), 
tight skin, disability from sclerodactyly 
 b.  arthritis – arthropathy in a rheumatoid distribution, carpal tunnel symptoms 
 c.  gastrointestinal symptoms – dysphagia, heartburn (oesophagitis), diarrhoea 
(malabsorption) 
 d.  renal tract symptoms – hypertension, chronic kidney disease, scleroderma renal crisis 
 e.  respiratory symptoms – symptoms of interstitial lung disease, pleurisy, known 
diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension 
 f.  cardiac symptoms – symptoms of pericarditis, palpitations (arrhythmias), symptoms 
of cardiac failure (dilated cardiomyopathy) 
 g.  other symptoms – erectile dysfunction, hypothyroidism, history of non-melanoma 
skin cancer. 
 2.  Consider the diff erential diagnosis ( Table 9.19 ). Graft versus host disease can mimic 
scleroderma. Also ask about a history of exposure to polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
 L -tryptophan (eosinophilic myalgia syndrome) and drugs (e.g. bleomycin, pentazocine). 
 Table 9.19   Differential diagnosis of scleroderma 
These rare conditions are not associated with Raynaud ’ s phenomenon or antinuclear antibodies: 
 1.  Eosinophilic fasciitis 
 2.  Morphea 
 3.  Scleroderma 
 4.  Nephrogenic systemic ﬁ brosis 
 5.  Diabetic cheiroarthropathy 
 
 
271
9 • The rheumatological long case
Nephrogenic systemic fi brosis can occur in dialysis patients exposed to gadolinium 
during an MRI. Also ask about drugs likely to aggravate Raynaud ’ s phenomenon 
(e.g. beta-blockers); a possible association with silicone breast implants seems to have 
been negated. Don ’ t miss diabetic-induced skin thickening. 
 3.  Ask about treatment received (e.g.  D -penicillamine) and any side-eff ects (see 
 Table 9.21 ). 
 4.  Enquire about degree of disability – function at home, ability to work, fi nancial security. 
 Scleroderma may be classifi ed as limited or diff use. 
 HINTS 
 •  Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (face, hands and feet) is associated with a risk 
of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 •  Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma is associated with a risk of interstitial lung disease, 
serositis and acute renal failure (scleroderma renal crisis). 
 In CREST (typically a more limited form of scleroderma, usually with oesophageal 
involvement, which causes dysphagia), sclerodactyly is usually limited to the distal 
extremities and / or face. Th e signs are:
 C alcinosis (calcifi c deposits in subcutaneous tissue at the ends of the fi ngers) ( Fig. 9.12 ) 
 Raynaud ’ s phenomenon (resulting in loss of tissue pulp at the ends of the fi ngers) 
 (o) E sophageal involvement 
 S clerodactyly (tightening of the skin on the fi ngers) ( Fig. 9.13 ) 
 T elangiectasia. 
 Progressive pulmonary fi brosis (ILD) is more common in patients with diff use disease 
who have topisomerase 1 antibodies. Pulmonary hypertension is six times more common 
in patients with limited disease; it tends to occur late in the course of the disease. Patients 
with rapidly progressing dyspnoea are more likely to have pulmonary hypertension than 
ILD. Th ese lung conditions are the main causes of mortality for scleroderma patients. 
 Localised scleroderma is called  morphea . It presents as single or multiple plaques of 
skin induration. 
 The examination (see  Table 9.20 ) 
 1.  Make a general inspection for weight loss (due to malabsorption or dysphagia). 
 2.  Look at the hands. Look for the signs of limited scleroderma. Th ese include sclerodactyly 
(tightening of the skin of the fi ngers – see  Fig. 9.13 ) with extension up to the elbow, 
telangiectasia, fi nger tapering, pitting scars, signs of calcinosis (calcifi c deposits in 
subcutaneous tissue at the ends of the fi ngers – see  Fig. 9.12 ) and the eff ects of 
Raynaud ’ s phenomenon (loss of tissue pulp at the ends of the fi ngers). Nail-fold 
capillaroscopy is useful, but few have the skill. Th e presence of dilated tortuous 
vessels (giant loops) almost always indicates an underlying connective tissue disorder 
of some sort. Assess hand function. 
 3.  Look at the arms for skin changes and assess proximal weakness (myositis). 
 4.  Examine the head. Note any alopecia. Look at the face for ‘salt-and-pepper’ pigmenta-
tion, loss of wrinkling, ‘bird-like’ or ‘mouse-like’ facies (because of puckering of the 
mouth) and telangiectasia. Check for any diffi  culty in closing the eyes, dryness of 
the eyes (Sjögren ’ s syndrome) and pale conjunctivae (anaemia). Check for any diffi  culty 
in opening the mouth wide and for dryness and puckering of the mouth.

 5.  Look at the chest for the ‘Roman breast plate’ eff ect as a result of skin tightening. 
 6.  Examine the cardiovascular system for pericarditis, arrhythmias, cor pulmonale and 
cardiac failure (due to myocardial fi brosis). 
 7.  Examine the respiratory system for interstitial lung disease, refl ux pneumonitis, 
infection, lung carcinoma and vasculitis. 
 8.  Look for jaundice and xanthelasma (primary biliary cholangitis occurs rarely with 
CREST). Scratch marks may be visible from pruritus. 
 9.  Look at the legs for vasculitis and ulceration. 
 10.  Take the blood pressure. 
 11.  Check the urine analysis and temperature charts. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Th e ESR may be raised. Anaemia may be present owing to chronic disease, iron 
defi ciency (secondary to bleeding from oesophagitis), folate or vitamin B 12 defi ciency 
(secondary to malabsorption), or a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, which is 
usually associated with acute renal crises. 
 2.  Hypergammaglobulinaemia (particularly IgG) is present in 50% of cases. Rheumatoid 
factor is present in 25% and ANA is found in most cases. Anti-Scl-70 is positive in 
a minority with diff use scleroderma. Anticentromere antibody is particularly associated 
with CREST (up to 70%) (see  Table 9.16 ). 
 3.  Investigations for malabsorption and dysphagia may be necessary.

 4.  Assess visceral involvement with chest X-ray fi lms, gastroscopy or oesophageal 
manometry, depending on the clinical presentation. 
 5.  Regular screening for ILD and pulmonary hypertension should be routine:
 a.  respiratory function tests, high-resolution CT of the chest for ILD 
 b.  echocardiography and, if pulmonary arterial hypertension is suspected, a right 
heart catheter and 6-minute walk test. 
 Treatment 
 Th is debilitating chronic disease will expose the patient to the need for recurrent investiga-
tions and adjustments to treatment. Th ese matters need careful explanation from the 
outset. Prognosis is worse in men and those with renal or late-onset disease. Patients 
with skin and gut involvement, but without other organ disease, have the best prognosis.
 1.  Symptomatic treatment includes avoiding vasospasm (by avoiding smoking, beta-
blockers and cold weather). Aggressive treatment of refl ux with proton pump inhibitors 
is important to prevent the formation of oesophageal strictures. Nifedipine, phenoxy-
benzamine, prazosin or methyldopa may help Raynaud ’ s phenomenon. Th e prostacyclin 
analogue iloprost has shown promise for Raynaud ’ s phenomenon in scleroderma. 
Th e endothelin antagonist bosentan is available in some places for the treatment of 
digital ischaemia. Morphea may respond to ultraviolet-A (UVA) light. 
 2.  Artifi cial tears are useful for dry eyes and NSAIDs may help with joint symptoms. 
 3.  Treat malabsorption (particularly bacterial overgrowth, with antibiotics). 
 4.  D -penicillamine (an immunosuppressant drug that also interferes with collagen cross-
linking) may be helpful for skin disease and may improve survival. It has been usual 
to start treatment with a low dose. Randomised studies have shown no advantage of 
higher doses. Th e drug has a number of severe side-eff ects ( Table 9.21 ). Monthly full 
blood counts are usually recommended. 
 5.  Cyclophosphamide is used if there is lung involvement and may improve other 
complications of the disease, especially if used early. Treatment is usually given for 9 
months. 
 6.  Pericarditis, infl ammatory myopathy and early ILD may respond to steroids. 
 7.  A number of drugs are approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH) in scleroderma patients ( Table 9.22 ).

 8.  Aggressive treatment of hypertension to prevent chronic kidney disease is vital – ACE 
inhibitors are the drug class of choice. An ACE inhibitor is often given to patients 
even with abnormal renal function to prevent or treat hypertensive renal crises. Dialysis 
is not contraindicated. A sudden increase in blood pressure should prompt investigations

 7.  Take a careful drug history. Medications that cause osteoporosis include steroids, 
alcohol, heparin, thyroxine over-replacement, anticonvulsants (by aff ecting vitamin 
D metabolism) and cyclosporin. 
 8.  Enquire about a poor diet (a low-fat diet often limits calcium intake) or inadequate 
sunlight exposure if the patient is a nursing home resident, has dark skin, or has a 
history of renal disease or phenytoin use (all risk factors for osteomalacia) ( Tables 
10.2 and  10.3 ). Ask about the patient ’ s exercise history, as physical activity throughout 
life preserves bone mass. Cigarette smoking reduces skeletal mass. 
 9.  Determine any risk factors for falls ( Table 10.4 ): a greater risk of falls increases the 
risk of fracture at any level of osteoporosis. Has the patient insight into his or her 
falls risk? Have exercises that might improve balance (e.g. Tai Chi) been recommended 
 Table 10.2   Causes of osteomalacia 
 1.  Unavailability of vitamin D:
 a.  vitamin D malabsorption (e.g. coeliac disease, pancreatic insufﬁ ciency, cirrhosis) 
 b.  abnormal vitamin D metabolism (e.g. chronic kidney disease, pseudohypoparathyroidism) 
 c.  decreased vitamin D bioavailability (e.g. inadequate sunlight, nephrotic syndrome, peritoneal 
dialysis) 
 2.  Phosphate unavailability caused by phosphate-binding antacids, hereditary hypophosphataemia, 
tumour-induced osteomalacia (e.g. ﬁ brous dysplasia of bone) and Fanconi ’ s syndrome type 1 or 2

 5.  Assess weight and general nutritional status. 
 HINT 
 Vitamin D deﬁ ciency is increasingly commonly diagnosed in people of all ages. Consider 
this in all patients with reduced bone density and especially in those with bone pain 
or muscle weakness. Risk factors include lack of exposure to sunlight (nursing home 
residents), fear of sunburn, dark skin and modest dress.

 Investigations 
 1.  Ask for the DEXA scan results. 
 Bone densitometry using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the lumbar 
spine and / or proximal femur remains the test of choice for evaluation of bone mineral 
density (BMD; see  Table 10.5 ).  Osteopenia is used to refer to a bone mineral density 
between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below peak bone mass;  osteoporosis refers 
to a bone mineral density of more than 2.5 SD below peak bone mass. Th e measure-
ment is often given as a T score. Th is is the number of SD by which the measured 
bone density falls below the average for a young normal person of the same sex. Th us, 
a T score of less than  − 2.5 defi nes osteoporosis. 
 2.  Review the serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase results. In osteoporosis, serum calcium 
and alkaline phosphatase levels should be normal. Alkaline phosphatase is usually elevated 
 
 
280
Examination Medicine
in all forms of osteomalacia. Check 25-OH vitamin D levels (not 1,25-OH vitamin 
D) if there are any risk factors for osteomalacia. If there is vitamin D defi ciency, serum 
25-OH vitamin D levels are usually low (e.g. vitamin D malabsorption, chronic liver 
disease, lack of exposure to sunlight – especially common in nursing home patients). 
 Assessment of calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D levels will 
usually distinguish the most important causes of osteomalacia and allow specifi c 
diagnostic tests to be appropriately directed ( Table 10.6 ). A sustained elevation of 
alkaline phosphatase should lead to consideration of osteomalacia, as well as Paget ’ s 
disease and metastatic malignancy to bone. 
 3.  A FBC and ESR estimation should be ordered to look for evidence of myeloproliferative 
disease, and renal and liver function tests should be ordered to exclude renal or hepatic 
disease. 
 4.  Th yroid-stimulating hormone should be measured to rule out thyrotoxicosis. 
 5.  If osteoporosis is unexpectedly severe, then a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) 
(electrophoretogram) should be considered to rule out multiple myeloma. In men, 
a serum testosterone level is worthwhile. 
 A Z score  < 2 SD below the age-related mean suggests a possible secondary cause 
for reduced bone density 
 6.  Ask to review any skeletal X-rays.
 •  In osteoporosis of the spine, there is characteristic loss of trabecular bone in the 
vertebral body, including accentuation of the vertebral endplates. Th e vertebral 
trabeculae become more prominent with the loss of horizontal trabeculae. Also 
look for collapse, anterior wedging and the codfi sh deformity (from expansion of 
the intervertebral disc; see  Fig. 10.1 ). 
 •  In osteomalacia, X-rays may show some decrease in bone density with coarsening 
of trabeculae and blurring of the margins. A specifi c abnormality is Looser ’ s zones 
(pseudo-fractures) in the long-bone shafts; these are ribbon-like zones of rarefaction. 
Other characteristic abnormalities may include a triangular (trefoil) pelvis and 
biconcave collapsed vertebrae. If there is secondary hyperparathyroidism present

subperiosteal resorption in the phalanges may be seen. 
 7.  In diffi  cult cases, an iliac crest bone biopsy with double tetracycline labelling can 
help to distinguish osteoporosis from osteomalacia. 
 8.  Consider undertaking tests for secondary causes of osteoporosis if the clinical picture 
suggests this may be helpful. 
 Treatment 
 Established osteoporosis is currently not reversible with medical therapy. Early intervention 
can prevent progression of osteoporosis and is of value. Secondary causes of osteoporosis 
should be identifi ed and corrected if present. 
 ANTIRESORPTIVE THERAPY 
 1.  Calcium: because calcium absorption decreases with age, calcium therapy has a modest 
benefi t in both early and late postmenopausal women. Consumption of 1200–1500 mg of 
calcium daily in adults over the age of 65 is advisable. Remember, though, the increased 
risk of cardiovascular events and renal calculi associated with calcium supplementation

Examination Medicine
 2.  Vitamin D supplementation: encourage sun exposure if that is possible. Moderate 
or severe vitamin D defi ciency (serum 25-OH D  < 25 nmol / L) should be treated 
with high-dose supplements of vitamin D of 3000–5000 IU / day for 6–12 weeks, 
and then 1000 IU / day from then on. Elderly women in nursing homes who have 
inadequate intake should receive supplementation of vitamin D 800 IU / day and 
calcium 1200 mg / day. Th is has been shown to reduce non-vertebral fracture risk. 
 3.  Generally recommend ceasing smoking, avoiding excess alcohol consumption: 
institute fall prevention measures and prescribe regular weight-bearing exercise. Consider 
a hip protector. 
 4.  Weight-bearing exercise : walking, dancing, tennis, etc. Resistance training exercise: 
lifting weights (not too heavy). Th ese have been shown to increase bone mineral 
density and reduce the risk of falls. 
 5.  Bisphosphonates (risendronate and alendronate): these drugs increase bone mineral 
density in postmenopausal women and have been shown to reduce the risk of fracture 
for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis by 50%. Patients unable to tolerate oral 
bisphosphonates because of upper GIT problems can be given the drug as an infusion 
once every 3 months or, with some of the newer agents, once a year. Intravenous 
treatment should be avoided in people with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease. 
Th e oral drugs can cause oesophageal ulceration that presents with odynophagia, usually 
within 1–2 months of commencing therapy. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is another serious 
but rare side-eff ect, which is more likely to occur with intravenous formulations in the 
presence of previous dental infections. A dental review may be indicated before treatment 
is begun. Th ese drugs are now indicated for patients aged over 70 who have a BMD 
T score of  − 3 or less and for those who have had a fracture after minimal trauma. 
 Alternative drugs for people who are unable to take bisphosphonates include:
 a.  denosumab – a humanised monoclonal antibody that reduces osteoclastogenesis 
by binding RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) 
 b.  strontium ranelate – its eff ectiveness for preventing hip fractures has not been 
established, but there is evidence for its use in protecting against vertebral and rib 
fractures. It should be taken at bedtime at least 2 hours after eating. 
 6.  Oestrogen: hormone replacement therapy will prevent loss of cortical and trabecular 
bone in postmenopausal women. Th erapy is probably more eff ective if started earlier 
in menopause as bone loss is most rapid then. Because oestrogen increases the risk 
of endometrial carcinoma, combination with progesterone is important unless a 
hysterectomy has been performed. A past history of endometrial cancer is a contrain-
dication. Th ere is an increased risk of breast cancer, as well as DVT and pulmonary 
embolism. Cardiovascular risk is also increased and hence its use in postmenopausal 
women has declined. 
 7.  Selective oestrogen receptor modulators: raloxifene, closely related to tamoxifen, 
reduces the risk of spine fractures. It increases the risk of DVT, but lowers the risk 
of breast cancer (and is not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer). 
Tamoxifen is a mixed oestrogen receptor antagonist and agonist that prevents bone 
loss. It increases the risk of endometrial cancer. 
 8.  Calcitonin: there have been inconsistent results with calcitonin and any eff ect is 
smaller than with other therapies. Th e drug can be given subcutaneously or intranasally. 
Administration can cause nausea, fl ushing and infl ammation. 
 BONE FORMATION THERAPY 
 1.  Parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptide (teriparatide): this drug is very eff ective for 
osteoporosis but very expensive. It is given subcutaneously for 18 months. After this, 
 
 
283
10 • The endocrine long case
antiresorptive treatment should be restarted. It is generally reserved for people who 
have a fracture while taking a bisphosphonate and have a T score of  − 3.0 or less. 
 2.  Men with osteoporosis: men who have osteoporosis and androgen defi ciency should 
be given androgen replacement unless there is a history of prostatic carcinoma. 
Bisphosphonates and teriparatide are effi  cacious; the role of raloxifene is not clear. 
 3.  Steroid-induced osteoporosis: this is very important because, if prednisone is considered 
likely to be needed for a number of months or longer, then measures to prevent bone 
loss are important from the time steroids are begun, particularly in postmenopausal 
women or when high doses are needed. Co-administration of bisphosphonates is of 
value here. Calcium and 25-OH vitamin D in combination have also been shown to 
be eff ective. Th ese are the only drugs that have been shown to reduce fracture risk for 
patients on steroids. Other general measures, such as cessation of smoking and a regular 
exercise regimen, are probably important and should be recommended to the patient. 
 4.  Surgical treatment of fractures: this is often required. Frail elderly patients with 
other medical problems require careful assessment of anaesthetic risk. 
 Vertebral fractures may cause severe pain that requires potent analgesics. Bed rest 
should be as brief as possible. Injection of bone cement into the vertebral body 
(vertebroplasty) may relieve acute severe pain but seems to be of limited benefi t in 
controlled studies and has fallen out of favour. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Is  this patient ’ s fracture risk adequately managed? 
 2.  Does  this patient with a renal transplant qualify for a DEXA scan? 
 3.  Are other investigations warranted for  this patient with vertebral fractures before 
she receives treatment for osteoporosis? 
 4.  What is your assessment of this patient ’ s risk of falls? 
 Hypercalcaemia 
 Hypercalcaemia is a common medical problem and therefore can appear in a long case. 
It is most likely to be a diagnostic problem. Most patients (90%) have hyperparathyroidism 
or malignancy ( Table 10.7 ). Th e asymptomatic patient usually has hyperparathyroidism. 
A malignant condition that is advanced enough to cause hypercalcaemia is likely to 
have also caused other symptoms. Th e diagnosis is often made from a routine blood 
test and the patient may have no symptoms. 
 The history 
 If the patient tells you that he or she has high calcium levels:
 1.  Enquire about the non-specifi c symptomatic manifestations. Th ese include tiredness, 
weakness and episodes of confusion. Enquire about anorexia and constipation, as 
well as nausea and vomiting; acute abdominal pain from acute pancreatitis may have 
occurred. Enquire about polyuria and polydipsia. Ask about a history of hypertension 
or a slow heart rate. 
 2.  Enquire about a history of peptic ulcer or renal colic (‘stones, moans, bones and 
abdominal groans’) from primary hyperparathyroidism. Ask about joint pain from 
 
 
284
Examination Medicine
pseudogout (chondrocalcinosis in primary hyperparathyroidism). Enquire about a 
past history of hypertension (hyperparathyroidism). 
 3.  Ask the patient whether he or she was known to have had a neck mass in the past 
or has had an operation to remove the parathyroid gland. In most cases a single 
adenomatous gland is found, but masses can be multiple. Surgical parathyroid-
ectomy is the defi nitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. Most neck 
masses will be coincidental thyroid nodules rather than a benign or malignant 
parathyroid tumour. 
 4.  Ask whether the patient has had an eye examination and, if so, whether calcium 
was seen (band keratopathy). Also, ask whether X-rays of the bones have been taken. 
In hyperparathyroidism, X-rays of the hand may show subperiosteal reabsorption 
with a moth-eaten appearance on the radial sides of the phalanges and in the distal 
phalangeal tufts (osteitis fi brosa cystica), as well as in the distal clavicles. 
 5.  Determine whether there is any past history of malignant disease, including diseases 
that metastasise to bone (e.g. carcinoma or myeloma) or haematological disease such 
as lymphoma (ectopic vitamin D production). 
 6.  Ask about drugs, including thiazide diuretics and lithium, and ingestion of calcium 
or vitamin D. 
 7.  Enquire about known chronic kidney disease, a cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism 
because of resistance to parathyroid hormone and growth of the size of the glands. 
Th ese enlarged glands then produce partly non-suppressible parathyroid hormone 
and hypercalcaemia. 
 8.  Ask about symptoms of thyrotoxicosis or phaeochromocytoma. Ask about recent 
immobilisation. 
 9.  Check whether there is a family history of high serum calcium levels, such as familial 
hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (autosomal dominant). Classically, a patient with this 
condition has had hypercalcaemia since a relatively young age, with only a slight 
elevation in the serum parathyroid hormone level at most, and with a personal or 
family history of unsuccessful neck exploration; it does not require any therapy. 
A family history of hypercalcaemia may also occur with the multiple endocrine 
neoplasia syndromes MEN1 and MEN2A. Th ese are both autosomal dominant 
conditions. Th ese patients may have symptoms related to the other features of their 
MEN syndrome (e.g. peptic ulceration from the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome – a 
result of a tumour causing excess gastrin secretion and therefore increased gastric 
acid production).

 5.  Ask to review the chest X-ray. Investigations to look for malignancy if suspected may 
then be required (e.g. protein electrophoresis, CT scan, etc.). 
 Treatment 
 Th ere is evidence that asymptomatic patients with hyperparathyroidism who are not 
treated have increased bone loss compared with controls. Signifi cant increases in fracture 
risk (especially of the wrist and spine) have been demonstrated.
 1.  If the diagnosis is hyperparathyroidism and the patient is symptomatic, has renal 
stones or has a reduced bone density, surgical parathyroidectomy is usually indicated. 
If the patient is asymptomatic, treatment is more controversial, but younger patients 
( < 50 years) with higher serum or 24-hour urine calcium levels will usually be off ered 
surgery. Preoperative localisation is commonly performed using a combination of 
ultrasound and sestamibi scanning as this may enable a minimally invasive operation. 
 2.  Note whether there has been hypocalcaemia after surgery. If there is no residual para-
thyroid tissue left, lifelong vitamin D therapy is necessary; alternatively, autotransplanta-
tion of parathyroid tissue into the forearm may be off ered. 
 3.  Primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with vitamin D defi ciency. Treatment is 
controversial if the patient is unfi t for surgery, but cautious vitamin D replacement 
is probably safe and desirable. 
 4.  In patients with malignant hypercalcaemia the underlying tumour should be treated. 
Steroids are often eff ective in lowering the serum calcium level. With granulomatous 
disease, steroids are also eff ective in lowering the calcium level (but avoid if infection 
is the cause); chloroquine may be useful in patients who cannot tolerate steroids. 
Lithium treatment may need to be stopped. Hypercalcaemia does not necessarily 
mean lithium toxicity. 
 5.  Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia rarely causes symptoms and should not be 
treated with parathyroidectomy. Consider screening all fi rst-degree relatives. 
 6.  In an emergency, rehydration with intravenous saline and frusemide is indicated for 
hypercalcaemia. Parenteral calcitonin lowers calcium levels only transiently. Th e use 
of intravenous bisphosphonates is very eff ective. 
 Possible lines of questioning

and what investigations would help? 
 2.  How would you manage  this patient with hypercalcaemia detected on a routine

from western or southern Europe up to 10% of people over the age of 85 are aff ected. 
Th e condition is characterised by excessive resorption of bone and increased formation 
of new bone in an irregular ‘mosaic’ pattern. Bone turnover may be increased 20 times

early on in the course of the disease. Th e aetiology is unknown, but it may be caused 
by a persistent paramyxovirus infection of osteoclasts. Th ere are reports of familial 
occurrence (15% have a family history) and of autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations 
of the  SQSTM1 gene are a cause. Th e condition is rare in Asian populations. It presents 
as a management problem. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about symptoms that led to the diagnosis:
 a.  isolated elevation of alkaline phosphatase on routine blood testing 
 b.  an incidental fi nding on an X-ray (common) 
 c.  bone pain 
 d.  secondary osteoarthritis 
 e.  change in height or hat size 
 f.  progressive bone deformity or pathological fracture; gait abnormalities associated 
with change in length of a long bone 
 g.  neurological symptoms – hearing loss, 1 neurological gait disturbance (suggestive 
of basilar invagination with long tract signs, cerebellar involvement or spinal cord 
compression), cranial nerve symptoms, headache 
 h.  symptoms of congestive cardiac failure 
 i.  symptoms of renal colic (as there is an increased incidence of calcium nephrolithiasis 
in this disease, especially during the resorptive phase) 
 j.  gout, secondary to increased bone turnover 
 k.  sarcoma of bone (very rare – less than 1% of cases, occasionally multicentric) 
 l.  symptoms of hypercalcaemia – thirst, polyuria, nausea, coma (a rare occurrence 
even in immobilised patients, or alternatively caused by coexisting primary hyper-
parathyroidism, which is common) 
 m.  pathological fractures, especially of the convex side of weight-bearing bones, which 
can be multiple. 
 2.  Enquire about articular pain, which may be caused by secondary osteoarthritis in 
joints adjacent to sites of Pagetic involvement, and true bone pain. Secondary osteo-
arthritis is characterised by pain and stiff ness, which improves with joint movement; 
alternatively, it may initially be exacerbated by weight-bearing and relieved by rest. 
True bone pain is more often constant or gnawing and is worse at night. A sudden 
exacerbation of bone pain may indicate a pathological fracture or the development 
of an osteosarcoma. 
 3.  Ask about treatment, its eff ectiveness and side-eff ects. 
 4.  Enquire about disability at home and work. Remember, though, that most patients 
are asymptomatic. 
 The examination ( Table 10.8 ) 
 1.  Inspect generally for short stature and obvious deformity ( Fig. 10.2 ). 
 2.  Look at the face. Measure the skull diameter ( > 55 cm may be abnormal). Look for 
prominent skull veins, feel for bony warmth (actually caused by vasodilatation in 
the skin) and auscultate for systolic bruits. Examine the fundi for angioid streaks 
( Fig. 10.3 ), and for papilloedema or optic atrophy, which are rare. Also, assess visual 
acuity and visual fi elds. 
 1 Deafness is usually conductive rather than sensorineural and is due to osteosclerosis of the temporal 
bone rather than compression of the auditory nerve.

 3.  Test to see whether hearing is decreased as a result of ossicle involvement or eighth 
nerve compression. Remember,  all the other cranial nerves may rarely be aff ected 
owing to overgrowth of foramina or basilar invagination, so examine them carefully. 
 4.  Look at the neck for basilar invagination. Th ese patients have a short neck and low 
hairline, the head is held in extension and neck movements are decreased. 
 5.  Assess the jugular venous pressure and examine the heart for signs of cardiac failure 
due to a hyperdynamic circulation. 
 6.  Examine the back. Note any deformity, especially kyphosis. Tap for tenderness. Feel 
for warmth. Auscultate for systolic bruits over the vertebral bodies. 
 7.  Look at the legs for anterior bowing of the tibia and lateral bowing of the femur. Feel 
for warmth. Note any changes of osteoarthritis in the hips and knees. Th ere may be 
limitation of hip movements – especially abduction, which suggests protrusio acetabuli 
– and fi xed fl exion deformity of the knees. Be careful, as the bones may be tender. 
 8.  Sarcomas (a feared, but rare, complication) should be looked for, particularly in the 
femur, humerus and skull; they usually present as tender, localised swellings. Th ey 
can be multiple. 
 9.  A full neurological examination is necessary for signs of spinal cord compression 
and basilar invagination, which may even cause quadriparesis. If the patient is mobile, 
do not forget to assess walking for any disability. Cerebellar signs may also rarely 
occur with basilar invagination. 
 10.  Check the urine analysis (for blood, as renal stone incidence is increased) and measure 
the patient ’ s height (for serial follow-up). 
 Investigations 
 Th ese are indicated in symptomatic patients requiring treatment and in asymptomatic 
subjects to determine the extent of skeletal involvement. Paget ’ s disease is occasionally 
confused with osteoblastic bone secondaries (e.g. from prostate, Hodgkin ’ s disease) or 
fi brous dysplasia.
 1.  Testing for hypercalcaemia may be worthwhile for any patient who is immobilised. 
 2.  Th e serum alkaline phosphatase level is an indicator of disease activity, as is the urinary 
hydroxyproline level. Other biochemical markers of bone turnover will also be increased 
(e.g. osteocalcin, urine or serum cross-links of collagen).

 3.  Radiologically, the bones most often involved are the pelvis, femur, skull and tibia 
(see  Figs 10.4 and  10.5 ). Look for bony enlargement, increased density, an irregular 
widened cortex and cortical infractions (incomplete pseudofractures) on the convex 
side of the bowed long bones. Th e early lytic phase of the disease, presenting with a 
fl ame-shaped osteolytic wedge advancing along the bones, is often overlooked. Secondary 
arthritic changes may occur (e.g. in hips). Bone scanning is more sensitive than an 
X-ray in assessing the extent of disease. CT scanning or MRI may be useful in the 
investigation of an atypical lesion, especially if sarcoma is suspected. 
 Treatment 
 Th e indications for treatment are bone pain, progressive deformity or complications 
such as neural compression or high-output cardiac failure, and as a prelude to orthopaedic 
surgery. Treatment of patients with Pagetic involvement of weight-bearing bones may 
be indicated to attempt to prevent deformity and pathological fracture. Proof of benefi t 
is not available, however.
 1.  Simple analgesics (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, should be 
used fi rst to control pain. Orthopaedic procedures such as total hip replacement may 
be indicated. 
 2.  A number of drugs are available that reduce bone resorption:
 a.  An oral bisphosphonate (e.g. alendronate) is usually the fi rst-line treatment for a 
defi ned period (usually 6 months). Th ese drugs are eff ective at reducing hydroxy-
proline excretion and often relieve symptoms, but may exacerbate bone pain initially. 
Th ey also impair bone mineralisation and may cause osteomalacia. However, bone

turnover is reduced and new bone is usually more normal in structure. Th e bis-
phosphonates should be given in combination with calcium supplements and 
vitamin D. Ulcerating oesophagitis causing dysphagia is an important side-eff ect. 
Th e bisphosphonates are not generally indicated for asymptomatic patients. 
Intravenous infusions of the potent bisphosphonate pamidronate may produce 
prolonged suppression of Pagetic activity and may normalise bone turnover in 
patients with mild disease without adverse eff ects on bone mineralisation or bone 
formation. 
 b.  Calcitonin of salmon or human origin, given subcutaneously, often improves bone 
pain and may be useful in the treatment of neurological complications. Although 
side-eff ects (nausea, fl ushing and diarrhoea) are common and may limit treatment 
in up to 20% of patients, it is still second-line therapy. Resistance to salmon 
calcitonin after 1–2 years may indicate the development of neutralising antibodies. 
Serum alkaline phosphatase levels and urinary hydroxyproline levels are useful 
guides to the eff ect of treatment: a 50% reduction in either test value indicates a 
good response to treatment. 
 c.  Mithramycin, given intravenously, can be very eff ective. It is reserved for occasions 
when rapid remission is required (e.g. spinal cord compression). Th ere may be 
signifi cant increases in bone lysis and predisposition to fractures with this drug, 
as well as bone marrow depression. 
 3.  Surgery, including osteotomy for mis-shapen femurs, may be useful. It is important 
for the patient to avoid immobilisation in the postoperative period because of the 
risk of hypercalcaemia.

 4.  Th e appearance of osteosarcoma (see  Fig. 10.4 ) is associated with a poor prognosis. 
Preoperative chemotherapy followed by amputation – the current treatment for 
spontaneously occurring tumours – is being evaluated. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Do you think  this patient has any evidence of neurological complications of Paget ’ s 
disease? 
 2.  What would be your strategy for drug treatment for  this patient and what would 
you tell him or her about the likely success and complications of the treatment?

 Acromegaly 
 Although an uncommon condition (three to four new cases per million people a year), 
acromegaly is a chronic illness and common as a long or a short case. It can be a 
component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). 
 The history 
 Th e patient will probably know the diagnosis, although if the condition has been suspected 
only recently then investigations may still be under way. Th e patient may be in hospital 
for these tests because of a complication of the condition or, perhaps more likely, may 
have been brought in for the clinical examinations.
 1.  Find out when the diagnosis was made and how long ago; in retrospect, the patient 
may have had symptoms for years. Th e average time taken to make the diagnosis is 
more than 10 years. 
 2.  Ask why the diagnosis was suspected. Th e onset of abnormalities is usually very 
gradual. Th e common features of the condition are listed in  Table 10.9 . Ask what 
changes the patient has been aware of and whether these have improved with treatment. 
Bony and acral changes are irreversible and early diagnosis is worthwhile. 
 3.  Ask about the associations and complications of the condition. Th e mortality rate 
for untreated acromegaly is about twice that of the age-matched population, mostly 
as a result of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Th ere is also an increase in 
the incidence of colonic polyps and carcinoma of the colon. 
 
 
293
10 • The endocrine long case
 4.  Th ere is now a recognised association with obstructive sleep apnoea and questions 
should be asked about snoring, daytime sleepiness and other relevant symptoms. Th e 
reason for the association is the enlargement of the tongue and swelling of the upper 
airway. 
 5.  Ask if the patient knows what investigations have been performed (see Investigations 
below). 
 6.  Ask about current and past treatment and how helpful this has been. Pituitary surgery 
and radiotherapy have a number of complications. 
 7.  As with any chronic illness, the eff ect of acromegaly on the patient ’ s life may be 
severe. Ask about occupation and ability to work. 
 The examination 
 See  pages 481–4 and  Fig. 10.6 . 
 Investigations 
 1.  Th e preferred test is measurement of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Unlike 
growth hormone (GH), which is aff ected by exercise and diet, the level of IGF-I does 
not fl uctuate and the absolute level reliably refl ects the average GH level. Th e result 
must be interpreted according to the patient ’ s age – levels are highest at puberty and 
decline with age. Th ere is also physiological elevation of the level in pregnancy. 
 Th e diagnosis is usually confi rmed with a glucose tolerance test, where GH sup-
pression (normal to  < 0.3  μ g / L) is measured in response to a glucose load. Failure 
of suppression is characteristic of acromegaly, but the test is non-specifi c and may be 
abnormal in renal impairment, thyrotoxicosis and diabetes. 
 2.  In 25% of acromegalic patients, the prolactin level is elevated and this can be associated 
with galactorrhoea. Other pituitary hormone levels may be low because of interference 
with normal pituitary function by the large mass of the tumour. Baseline pituitary

function should be assessed, with measurements of prolactin, cortisol, thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T 4 ), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising 
hormone (LH) ( Box 10.1 ). 
 3.  Imaging is performed once an elevated IGF-I is confi rmed. MRI scanning is the 
modality of choice as it provides excellent anatomical defi nition of the tumour 
( Fig. 10.7 ); 70% of tumours are macroadenomas ( > 1 cm). If the tumour is close to 
the optic chiasm then visual fi eld assessment should be performed. 
 Treatment 
 Th e aim of treatment is to prevent excess GH production without interfering with 
normal pituitary function.

295
10 • The endocrine long case
 Early diagnosis makes treatment easier and more eff ective, and IGF-I testing makes 
the diagnosis easier. 
 Acromegaly is cured when the IGF-I level is normal and GH is suppressed to less 
than 1.2 mIU / L after an oral glucose load. However, symptomatic relief can be obtained 
without complete cure. 
 Investigate for complications:
 •  HbA 1c 
 •  sleep study 
 •  echocardiogram 
 •  colonoscopy. 
 Medical treatment with long-acting somatostatin analogues is increasingly useful, 
both before surgery and afterwards if removal is incomplete. Overall, surgery remains 
the treatment of fi rst choice. 
 SURGERY 
 1.  Trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery is eff ective and remains fi rst-line treatment. Selective 
resection of the benign adenoma and preservation of pituitary function is possible 
in 50%–80% of surgically treated cases. If cure is defi ned as a return of IGF-I to the 
normal range, then surgical cure is less often obtained. Nevertheless, symptoms are 
almost always greatly relieved by surgical debulking of the tumour. 
 2.  Th e perioperative mortality rate should be less than 1%. 
 3.  Uncommon complications include cerebrospinal fl uid rhinorrhoea, diabetes insipidus 
and stroke. Hypopituitarism follows eventually in about 10% of patients. 
 MEDICAL TREATMENT – PATIENTS NOT CURED BY SURGERY 
 1.  Long-acting somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide LAR and lanreotide autogel, 
are available. Th ese drugs mimic the inhibition of GH release by somatostatin. Th ey 
have the advantage that they are suffi  ciently long-acting to be eff ective when given by 
subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Th e usual dose of octreotide LAR is 20 mg 
by intramuscular injection 4-weekly, but this can be increased or decreased depending 
on the GH and IGF-I levels. Lanreotide autogel is given as a starting dose of 60 mg 
by SC injection 4-weekly. Unlike somatostatin, these drugs do not signifi cantly inhibit 
insulin secretion. Unless surgery or radiotherapy has cured the disease, treatment must 
be continued indefi nitely. Symptoms such as headache, arthralgia and sweating improve 
after a few weeks. Biochemical remission occurs in up to 70% of patients. Th e drugs 
sometimes cause a 50%–70% reduction in the size of the tumour, which can make 
surgery easier. Side-eff ects of treatment are usually relatively mild and include discomfort 
at the injection site, diarrhoea, anorexia, abdominal bloating and cholelithiasis. 
 Long-acting depot injections are now available but expensive. For this reason, they 
are usually reserved for patients in whom other treatment has not been completely 
successful or is contraindicated. 
 2.  Cabergoline is also available for treating acromegaly. It causes a paradoxical suppression 
of GH release in acromegalics but, at tolerated doses, remission is not usually obtained. 
Side-eff ects include nausea, anorexia and hypotension. Th e drug is most often used 
as adjunctive treatment after radiotherapy or surgery. 
 RADIOTHERAPY 
 Radiotherapy is usually considered as a second-line treatment where surgery has not 
been completely eff ective.
 1.  Conventional radiotherapy delivers about 5000 cGy to the pituitary over 5 weeks. 
It works only slowly. GH levels take a year to fall by 25%. Even after 10 years, few 
 
 
296

patients achieve normal IGF-I levels. Hypopituitarism is common after radiotherapy, 
but other side-eff ects are rare. 
 2.  Newer, more promising techniques use computerised MRI to deliver larger doses 
accurately to the gland (‘stereotactic radiosurgery’). 
 SCREEN FOR COMPLICATIONS 
 1.  Cardiovascular: echocardiography 5- to 10-yearly (heart failure, valve disease). 
 2.  Gastrointestinal: colonoscopy for polyps – at diagnosis and as required for 
surveillance. 
 3.  Th yroid: thyroid examination and thyroid function tests (TFTs) regularly. 
 4.  Metabolic: check blood pressure, check lipids annually, fasting blood sugar level (BSL) 
annually. 
 5.  Musculoskeletal: ask about symptoms, carpal tunnel, arthropathy. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What screening would you recommend to  this acromegalic patient for complications 
of the disease? 
 2.  How would you explain to  this patient the beneﬁ ts of surgery compared with non-
surgical treatment of his acromegaly? 
 HINT 
 Candidates are often tempted to unleash a set piece  diabetes long-case formula on the 
examiners. Don ’ t do it. Tailor the presentation to the actual patient you have seen. 
 Types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus 
 Th is is a common subject for the long case since patients with diabetes are always avail-
able. A large proportion of long-case patients have type 2 diabetes, often as part of the 
‘metabolic syndrome’. Diabetes usually presents a management rather than a diagnostic 
problem. Th e examiners like this disease because it tests very practical management skills. 
 Juvenile diabetes (immune-mediated diabetes) is called type 1 and maturity-onset 
diabetes (non-immune-mediated diabetes) is called type 2. Most type 1 diabetes (type 
1A) is associated with autoimmune destruction of islet cells, but a small proportion of 
these diabetics do not have these abnormalities (type 1B).  Table 10.10 lists the antibodies 
known to be associated with type 1 diabetes. Th e cause of type 1B diabetes in these 
patients is not known, but it is more common in Asian populations. Type 2 diabetes is 
increasingly found in obese adolescents and children. More than 90% of diabetics have 
type 2 disease.
 •  Don ’ t forget the criteria for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus – a fasting (overnight) 
blood sugar level of 7.0 mmol / L or higher on at least two separate occasions or, in 
the absence of fasting hyperglycaemia, a 2-hour postprandial glucose level of 
11.1 mmol / L or higher. 
 
 
297
10 • The endocrine long case
 •  Fasting blood glucose levels between 6.1 and 7.0 mmol / L are considered to represent 
impaired fasting glucose levels. In a patient with symptoms of diabetes, a random 
BSL of  > 11.1 mmol / L is diagnostic. 
 •  Th ere is evidence that complications of diabetes may occur in some populations when 
the fasting glucose level is over 6.1 mmol / L. 
 •  An HbA 1c level of  > 48 mmol / mol ( > 6.5%) is consistent with a diagnosis of diabetes 
and often used in place of a formal glucose tolerance test to make the diagnosis, 
except in pregnancy (see  p. 307 ). 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about the age at which diabetes was diagnosed and its manner of presentation 
– thirst, polyuria and polydipsia, weight loss, infection, ketoacidosis, asymptomatic 
glycosuria. Remember the rare causes of glucose intolerance ( Table 10.11 ).

Examination Medicine
 2.  Ask about the treatment initiated at diagnosis and major changes that have occurred 
over time (insulin is required for survival in type 1 diabetes, which usually has an 
onset below age 30 years; in type 2 diabetes, control typically becomes more diffi  cult 
with time). 
 3.  Ask about the diet prescribed ( Table 10.12 ). People with diabetes are educated 
regarding the requirements of a healthy diet. In addition, most type 1 diabetes 
patients are taught carbohydrate counting. Th is allows them to work out the car-
bohydrate content of their meals. Th ey then base their rapid-acting insulin dose on 
their carbohydrate intake, for example 1 unit for every 10 g of carbohydrate. 
 What has happened to the patient ’ s weight since the diagnosis was made? 
 4.  Ask whether oral hypoglycaemic drugs have been used or are being taken. 
 5.  Ask about insulin treatment – how much and when taken. Th e usual dose is 0.5 
units / kg / day, with 40% of the dose comprising a long-acting insulin. Also ask 
where the insulin is injected and by whom, and fi nd out the type of insulin syringe 
used (e.g. a pen injector). 
 6.  Ask about the progress of the disease:
 a.  assessment of control adequacy – does the patient use a home blood glucose 
monitoring meter? If the patient is blind, is the glucometer a talking version? 
Which glucose reagent strip is used and which meter? (Remember that diff erent 
meters require diff erent reagent strips.) Enquire how often the test is done, the 
usual results, at what time of day the test is performed (pre- or postprandial or 
both) and whether the dose is adjusted at other times (e.g. gastrointestinal upset). 
Ask about recent glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) results. Ask about symptoms 
of poor control:
 i.  hyperglycaemia – polyuria, thirst, weight loss, intermittent blurring of vision, 
hospital admissions with ketoacidosis (type 1 diabetes only) 
 ii.  hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia awareness – ask the patient to describe the 
symptoms and how they are managed; ask specifi cally about morning headaches, 
morning lethargy and night sweats (symptoms suggestive of nocturnal hypo-
glycaemia), weight gain and seizures; ask about the time of day in relation to 
food, alcohol, exercise and insulin injection 
 b.  involvement of other systems:
 i.  vascular system – ischaemic heart disease, intermittent claudication, cerebro-
vascular disease 
 ii.  nervous system – peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy (causing erectile 
dysfunction, fainting, nocturnal diarrhoea), amyotrophy 
 iii.  eyes – regular visits to an ophthalmologist or retinal photography at the diabetes 
clinic and treatment received (ask especially about laser treatment)

 • 
 Protein 10%–20% kJ / day 
 • 
 Saturated fat  < 10% kJ / day

 iv.  renal system – dysuria, nocturia, oedema, hypertension; is the patient taking an 
ACE inhibitor or AR blocker for renal protection; has there been proteinuria? 
 v.  skin – boils, vaginitis and balanitis,  Candida , necrobiosis lipoidica. 
 7.  Ask about drug history – steroids, thiazides, oral contraceptives, beta-blockers. 
 8.  Ask about associated other diseases – history of pancreatitis, Cushing ’ s syndrome, 
acromegaly. 
 9.  Enquire about social background – type of work, living conditions (living alone or 
with family), coping with giving insulin (associated blindness, etc.), eating habits, 
fi nancial situation, driving (type of licence held – testing of BSL before driving). 
 10.  Ask about variations in weight and a regular exercise program. Have diet and exercise 
led to a fall in weight since the diabetes was diagnosed? 
 11.  Ask about cardiovascular risk factors, including family history, serum cholesterol 
level, smoking and hypertension, and drug and non-drug attempts at control of 
these factors (except family history). 
 12.  Enquire about family history of diabetes and obstetric history (e.g. big babies, 
stillbirths), and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes ( Table 10.13 ). 
 13.  Ask whether the patient has an ‘action plan’ for hypoglycaemic symptoms and what 
this involves ( Table 10.14 ). 
 The examination 
 Detailed examination is essential; look specifi cally for causes and complications of the 
disease ( Figs 10.8 and  10.9 ). In particular, don ’ t forget to look at the retina. Inspect the

 Management 
 Th e general aim is to regulate diet, exercise and insulin so as to allow the patient to lead 
a normal life while avoiding short- and long-term complications. 
 In adults with type 1 diabetes, multiple injection regimens are preferred because the 
improved control prevents or retards the progression of complications.

10 • The endocrine long case
 THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENT WITH DIABETES 
 Th e major management decision here is whether insulin is required. In some cases this 
will be obvious (e.g. for the type 1 patient with ketoacidosis), but for many elderly 
obese diabetics the position is not so clear. If insulin is not indicated at presentation, 
attempt to gain control fi rst by weight loss and diet, followed by oral hypoglycaemic 
agents.
 1.  Weight loss: weight loss to achieve ideal body weight increases insulin sensitivity. 
Abdominal obesity (waist:hip ratio  > 0.9 for women and  > 0.8 for men) increases 
the risk of metabolic complications. Realise that there is some disagreement about 
the ideal diet, but achieving ideal weight (whatever that is) is essential. 
 HINT 
 Helping patients to lose weight can be difﬁ cult and frustrating (see  Ch 13 ). It is best 
to be realistic with the examiners and say that numerous strategies to help the patient 
lose weight have been unsuccessful (if true) and that signiﬁ cant weight loss may not 
be possible (then talk about bariatric surgery if this is a reasonable option). 
 Usually weight loss fails. If the patient expresses some willingness to keep trying, 
suggest a realistic strategy and target weight. Examples include:
 a.  getting the patient to join a walking group 
 b.  hydrotherapy for patients with joint pain 
 c.  use of a pedometer or exercise mobile app. as a way of promoting exercise. 
 2.  Diet: the recommended diet (see  Table 10.12 ) should be tailored to the patient ’ s 
requirements and activities. For example, kilojoule recommendations for a 20-year-old 
man undertaking normal activities are 175 kJ / kg of body weight and for a 75-year-old 
man they are 140 kJ / kg. Distribution of carbohydrate should be worked out on an 
individual basis. Fat intake should be kept to  ≤ 30% of kilojoules for patients who 
are not overweight and considerably less for obese patients. Th e distribution of kilojoules 
is more important for insulin-requiring patients, who should usually have about 20% 
for breakfast, 35% for lunch, 30% for dinner and 15% for supper. Patients who use 
short-acting insulin before each meal may be able to vary the insulin dose to suit the 
meal. Th e diet should include high-fi bre foods and monounsaturated fats. Polyun-
saturated fats can raise triglyceride levels, but monounsaturates tend to reduce them. 
Patients with nephropathy may be advised to restrict protein intake, usually to about 
10% of kilojoule intake. 
 3.  Oral hypoglycaemic agents: the use of oral hypoglycaemic agents is fi rst-line treatment 
for type 2 patients where diet has not been successful.  Table 10.15 shows the National 
Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) treatment chart for type 2 
diabetes.
 a.  Metformin is the only available biguanide and is regarded as the agent of choice 
in the obese patient with type 2 diabetes. It is contraindicated for patients with 
an eGFR  < 30 mL / min / 1.73 m 2 . Side-eff ects of biguanides include:
 i.  diarrhoea, anorexia, nausea and occasionally vomiting 
 ii.  vitamin B 12 malabsorption 
 iii.  lactic acidosis (the risk is increased in the elderly and in patients with cardio-
vascular, liver and kidney disease); the drug is contraindicated in heart failure 
 
 
302
Examination Medicine
 iv.  interaction with radiocontrast materials; the drug should be stopped on the 
day of a procedure requiring contrast and for 48 hours afterwards 
 v.  metformin rarely causes hypoglycaemia and there is a synergistic eff ect when 
it is used in combination with sulfonylureas. 
 b.  Th e sulfonylureas used now are second-generation drugs (e.g. gliclazide, used for 
obese patients; glipizide, used for thin patients; and glibenclamide). Th e mechanism 
of action of sulfonylureas is to increase insulin secretion. Side-eff ects of current 
sulfonylureas are rare apart from the following:
 i.  Prolonged hypoglycaemia – this is greatest with glibenclamide, which is therefore 
not recommended for those over the age of 60; gliclazide and glipizide are as 
eff ective and are safer. 
 ii.  Th ey are usually added to metformin therapy rather than used instead of it. 
 Th e eff ectiveness of the sulfonylureas is variable and rates of secondary failure 
vary between agents. Primary failure occurs in 40% of cases and secondary failure 
in 3%–30%; only 20%–30% of patients continue with satisfactory control. Substitu-
tion of one drug for another may be worth trying ( Table 10.16 ). 
 Eventually secondary failure of sulfonylureas occurs owing to progressive decline 
in beta cell numbers. 
 c.  Th iazolidinediones (TZDs) are used as third-line treatment oral hypoglycaemic 
drugs. Th ey are used less than they had been previously because of problems with 
weight gain and exacerbation of heart failure (see  Table 10.16 ). Th ey reduce insulin 
resistance, blood sugar levels and triglycerides. Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are 
available in Australia: their use is restricted to patients whose HbA 1c is over 7% 
during the preceding 3 months and who are on maximum tolerated doses of 
metformin and a sulfonylurea. Patients on insulin must also be on metformin and 
have a raised HbA 1c . Liver function tests must be performed every 2 months for 
the fi rst year and the drug stopped if the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level rises 
above 2.5 times normal. Th e drugs are associated with small rises in HDL and 
LDL cholesterol and with peripheral oedema. Some are associated with an increased 
risk of ischaemic heart disease. Th ey are contraindicated for patients with class III 
or IV heart failure. 
 d.  Acarbose inhibits intestinal alpha-glucosidase, slowing polysaccharide degradation 
and absorption. It is a useful agent taken before meals with other treatment. 
Side-eff ects include fl atulence, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, but there is no major 
toxicity. 
 e.  Th e gliptins (DPP-IV inhibitors) sitaglitin, vidagliptin, saxagliptin and linagliptin 
increase the levels of incretin peptides (e.g. glucagon-like peptide) by inhibiting

can be used only in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea except for 
linagliptin, which can be used with both. Th ey are weight neutral and can be used 
in elderly patients, but chronic kidney disease is a relative contraindication. Th ey 
have to be injected. 
 f.  GLP-1 analogues: exenatide is a glucagon analogue resistant to DPP-IV degradation. 
It has to be given by injection twice a day. It can be especially useful for overweight 
patients. 
 g.  SGLT-2 inhibitors: these drugs slow gastric emptying and reduce glucagon secretion. 
Th ey tend to cause weight loss. Th ey have to be injected and should be stopped 
if the creatinine clearance falls below about 60 mL/min. A number of these drugs, 
including recently dapaglifl ozin, have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes 
quite dramatically in diabetic patients. 
 INSULIN THERAPY 
 1.  Insulin requirements initially are generally between 0.4 and 1.0 U / kg / day. An anorectic 
agent should be considered when requirements exceed 1.5 U / kg / day. Insulin therapy 
is often begun on an outpatient basis and, under these circumstances, small doses

(e.g. 0.25 U / kg / day) suffi  cient to prevent ketosis are used with a view to avoiding 
hypoglycaemia. 
 Modern insulins are either recombinant human insulin or analogue insulin ( Table 
10.17 ). Analogue insulins have been genetically altered to maintain their mono-
meric form when injected subcutaneously. Th is better mimics physiological insulin 
release. 
 Possible insulin regimens include:
 •  Type 1 diabetes: a basic bolus regimen, using a once-daily long-acting insulin 
analogue and short-acting insulin analogue at mealtimes (see  Table 10.17 ), or a 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an insulin pump. Extra 
insulin is given at mealtimes after calculation of the insulin:carbohydrate ratio and 
measurement of the blood sugar. Extra rapid-acting insulin is given if necessary. 
 •  Type 2 diabetes: basal insulin is used in combination with metformin. 
 Th e administration of intraperitoneal insulin via the dialysate can be useful in the 
management of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and 
continuous intraperitoneal infusion has been attempted in some centres. 
 Human insulin has replaced the highly purifi ed (monocomponent) insulins. Many 
patients reported altered symptoms of hypoglycaemia and a more rapid onset of 
symptoms after changing to human insulin. Aim for euglycaemia: ideally the glucose 
level should be between 3.5 and 7.0 mmol / L throughout the day and night.

 2.  Insulin resistance is defi ned as a requirement of more than 200 units per day. Causes 
of insulin resistance are:
 a.  obesity (decreased receptor number) 
 b.  insulin antibodies (uncommon, and an indication for a more purifi ed insulin) 
 c.  circulating antagonist hormones – growth hormone (e.g. in puberty), cortisol, 
thyroxine, glucagon 
 d.  association with acanthosis nigricans (e.g. receptor abnormalities, lipodystrophies). 
Remember, injecting into a lipoatrophied site may cause poor control because of 
unpredictable absorption. 
 3.  Insulin allergy has been uncommon since the widespread introduction of human 
insulins, but they can cause immediate local reactions (e.g. pruritus, local pain) or 
delayed reactions (e.g. swelling). Urticaria and anaphylaxis can also occur. Treatment 
in mild cases is with antihistamines and local steroids, but desensitisation is important 
in severe cases. Insulin allergy is more common in patients who stop and start insulin 
therapy. 
 4.  Fasting hyperglycaemia is a major management problem. Th e ‘Somogyi eff ect’ refers 
to rebound morning hyperglycaemia following nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which is 
thought to be caused by the release of counter-regulatory hormones. Th is is now, 
however, a matter of considerable debate. Th e treatment is to reduce the evening 
insulin dose. Th e ‘dawn’ phenomenon is early-morning hyperglycaemia in the  absence 
of nocturnal hypoglycaemia; the treatment is to increase the insulin coverage without 
inducing hypoglycaemia. 
 5.  Causes of hypoglycaemia in a previously stable diabetic on insulin therapy are:
 a.  decreased food intake, increased exercise or weight loss 
 b.  injection errors 
 c.  diabetic renal disease 
 d.  rare causes – high level of insulin antibodies, malabsorption, hypothyroidism, 
autoimmune adrenal insuffi  ciency, panhypopituitarism or an insulinoma. 
 6.  Glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) gives an indication of control over the preceding 3 
months. 
 Newly diagnosed patients should aim for tight blood sugar control (HbA 1c 
 < 50 mmol / mol – 6.8%), and those with advanced disease and who already have 
cardiovascular complications for less tight control (e.g.  < 60 mmol / mol). Spurious 
readings may occur in kidney failure, iron defi ciency, haemoglobinopathies and pregnancy. 
 DIABETES EDUCATION 
 Because diabetes is a lifelong disease, detailed education by the team looking after the 
patient is important. Regular follow-up is essential ( Table 10.18 ).
 1.  Blood glucose level (BGL) monitoring with a glucose meter is essential for all patients 
who can manage it – initially, testing several times a day before and 2 hours after 
 Table 10.18   What to do if BSL targets not met after drug adjustment 
 1.  Make sure the patient understands the point of treatment. 
 2.  Look again at diet, weight and exercise program. 
 3.  Ask about adherence; begin by asking about side-effects and then ask whether the patient has been 
able to take the medication. 
 4.  Exclude infection and use of new medications that would interfere with sugars, e.g. steroids. 
 BSL  = blood sugar level.

meals, and before bed, may be necessary; later, in stable diabetes, twice-daily testing 
may be enough. 
 2.  Exercise promotes glucose utilisation; in the well-controlled diabetic it is important 
to reduce the dose of regular insulin before exercise or supplement with glucose. 
( Note: Exercise in the poorly controlled diabetic may precipitate ketoacidosis because 
of increased release of counter-regulatory hormones.) 
 MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS 
 Complications are probably a result of damage caused by glycosylated proteins. Convincing 
evidence that tight control prevents or reverses complications is now available. Following 
the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the more recent United Kingdom 
Prognosis in Diabetes Study (UKPDS), clinicians now agree that rigorous control of 
blood sugar levels and aggressive control of blood pressure ( < 140 / 90) 2 and other 
cardiovascular risk factors is essential. Th ese measures are probably more eff ective in the 
early stages of the disease.
 1.  Th e blood pressure can be managed with any antihypertensive drug, but the use of 
an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) – but not 
both – is strongly indicated when proteinuria has been detected, and is often used 
routinely. 
 2.  Lipid control with the statins is being assessed in a number of trials. Th e high 
cardiovascular risk of these patients suggests that aggressive lipid-lowering with one 
of these drugs will be of value. Remember to control other risk factors, such as 
smoking (for retinopathy and vascular disease) and alcohol intake (for neuropathy 
and hypertriglyceridaemia). Aspirin prophylaxis is controversial, but prophylaxis 
should be recommended for patients with macrovascular complications. 
 3.  Ideally, all patients should be assessed every 2 years by an ophthalmologist. Less 
sophisticated fundoscopy may miss early diabetic retinopathy (see  Table 16.43 ,  p. 
490 ). Retinal cameras can now be used at the clinic to take clear retinal photographs, 
which can be repeated often and ‘read’ by an ophthalmologist. Retinopathy almost 
always precedes diabetic nephropathy. 
 4.  Diabetic nephropathy is a common cause of chronic kidney disease and results from 
arteriolar disease or glomerulosclerosis (classic Kimmelstiel–Wilson lesion or, more 
commonly, diff use intercapillary glomerulosclerosis). Th e evolution of diabetic 
nephropathy has been well studied and can be divided into the following stages:
 a.  glomerular hyperfi ltration 
 b.  microalbuminuria 
 c.  dipstick proteinuria 
 d.  proteinuria in the nephrotic range 
 e.  end-stage kidney disease. 
 5.  Microalbuminuria is defi ned as a urinary albumin excretion of 20–200  μ g / min 
(measured using sensitive immunoassays) on more than two occasions in the absence 
of urinary tract infection and intercurrent illness. Th e albumin:creatinine ratio may 
be a more sensitive way of assessing the presence of signifi cant proteinuria. Regular 
screening for microalbuminuria is now considered an important component of good 
diabetes management. Th e microalbuminuria stage is probably reversible with a 
combination of ACEI or ARB therapy, strict metabolic control and possibly dietary 
protein restriction. 
 2 Th e ACCORD study. 
 
 
307
10 • The endocrine long case
 6.  Once proteinuria develops, progression to end-stage kidney disease is common over 
a period of about 5–10 years. Th e rate of progression may be modifi ed by:
 a.  control of hypertension – ACEIs are the agents of choice, but it is important 
to be aware of the risk of hyperkalaemia as a result of hyporeninaemic hypoal-
dosteronism and deteriorating kidney function in patients with renovascular 
disease 
 b.  treatment of urinary tract infections 
 c.  dietary protein restriction 
 d.  possibly improving glucose control. 
 ACE inhibition is indicated as soon as proteinuria is detected. ARBs are an 
alternative for those intolerant of ACEIs. ACEI and ARB combination treatment 
may reduce proteinuria further, but has little additive eff ect on blood pressure and 
is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney failure. Th ere is an increased 
incidence of papillary necrosis with urinary tract infection. 
 7.  Th e best form of management for end-stage chronic kidney disease in a diabetic is 
peritoneal dialysis and early kidney transplantation. Remember that diabetics with 
chronic kidney failure almost invariably also have retinopathy, which may be worsened 
by haemodialysis. 
 8.  For type 1 diabetics with severe systemic complications or end-stage kidney disease, 
whole-organ pancreas (with or without kidney) transplantation is a promising 
therapeutic option. A number of successful kidney / pancreas transplants have been 
performed. Patients are generally euglycaemic without hypoglycaemic treatment. 
Th is is the treatment of choice for diabetics with kidney failure. 
 9.  Be aware of continuous glucose monitoring systems and whether the patient is using 
the technology. Remember, it measures the interstitial fl uid glucose (with a several-
minute time lag in terms of blood sugar level). Th ese devices improve glycaemic 
control in type I diabetes. 
 10.  Is an insulin pump being used? Short-acting insulin is given and if discontinued 
there is a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis so education in important. Use with continuous 
glucose monitoring reduces the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
 THE PREGNANT PATIENT WITH DIABETES 
 Remember that blood sugar levels are normally lower in pregnancy. A woman with 
no diabetic history should be screened for gestational diabetes in the 24th–28th week. 
A 75 g glucose load is given and the blood sugar is measured 1 and 2 hours later. 
Abnormal results (gestational diabetes) are: fasting  > 5.1, 1 hour  > 10.0, 2 hours 
 > 8.5 mmol / L.
 1.  High-risk women (previous gestational diabetes, BMI  > 35, maternal age  > 40) should 
be tested at 12–16 weeks. 
 2.  Insulin requirements vary during pregnancy owing to the eff ects of human placental 
lactogen (HPL). In the fi rst trimester, insulin requirements usually remain unchanged 
or may decrease, but in the second trimester some increase in insulin requirements 
occurs owing to rising HPL levels. By the third trimester, insulin requirements are 
usually at least 50% higher than before pregnancy, but after delivery there is a dramatic 
decrease in insulin requirements. 
 In general, insulin is used alone for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes, 
and diet, metformin or insulin for gestational diabetics. 
 3.  Blood glucose control should be improved as much as possible before conception in 
a diabetic woman wanting to undertake pregnancy. HbA 1c should be normalised, as 
strict metabolic control at the time of conception has been shown to prevent the

 b.  macrosomia

 e.  complications related to immaturity (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome, hypocal-

 4.  Use of home blood glucose monitoring, with testing of both pre- and postpran-

labour and delivery. Paediatric services and a neonatal intensive care unit should 
be available. Remember that statins, ACE inhibitors and ARBs  must be ceased in

than ageing. 
 •  Th e eGFR is not accurate in patients with limb amputation because of their loss of 
muscle mass. 
 The history 
 QUESTIONS REGARDING SYMPTOMS, DIAGNOSIS AND AETIOLOGY 
 1.  Early symptoms of renal failure include:
 •  nocturia 
 •  lethargy 
 •  loss of appetite 
 •  fl uid retention 
 •  pruritus. 
 Severe CKD (GFR  < 15–20 mL / min / 1.73 m 2 ) can cause:
 •  pericarditis 
 •  serositis 
 •  encephalopathy 
 •  gastrointestinal bleeding 
 •  uraemic neuropathy. 
 Patients are sometimes diagnosed following an episode of haematuria or loin pain. 
A fi rst episode of overt renal failure may have been precipitated by a further insult, 
such as:
 •  use of drugs such as NSAIDs, trimethoprim or, less commonly now, aminoglycoside 
administration 
 •  use of radiocontrast injections 
 •  infection 
 •  use of angiostensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) (if there is bilateral renal artery stenosis) 
 •  dehydration 
 •  anaemia. 
 Many patients are asymptomatic and have a family history. Sometimes haematuria 
or proteinuria has been detected during a routine or insurance medical examination 
or during pregnancy. 
 2.  Glomerulonephritis ( Table 11.4 ). Determine whether there is a history of:
 •  proteinuria 
 •  haematuria 
 •  oliguria 
 •  oedema 
 •  sore throat 
 •  sepsis 
 •  rash 
 •  haemoptysis 
 •  renal biopsy. 
 Run through the various causes listed below with the patient or ask ‘Have you 
been told what the cause of your kidney trouble is?’ Th is question may save a lot of 
time and trouble. 
 
 
312
Examination Medicine
 HINTS 
 Ask yourself after you have taken the history: ‘What is the cause of this patient ’ s CKD?’ 
Consider:
 1.  Glomerulonephritis: has the patient had a kidney biopsy? Was there any speciﬁ c 
change in therapy following the biopsy? For example, in IgA nephropathy, if there 
are signiﬁ cant chronic changes and reduced kidney function, data suggest there is 
little point in starting high-dose steroids. On the other hand, if there are no severe 
chronic changes (eGFR  > 80 mL/min and proteinuria  < 0.5 g/day) a 6-month trial of 
prednisolone ( ≈ 1 mg / kg / day) may be indicated to attempt to induce a remission, 
if supportive therapy with ACEIs or ARBS hasn ’ t helped. 
 2.  IgA nephropathy is associated with intermittent macroscopic haematuria, synpharyngitic 
haematuria (typically following soon after a mild upper respiratory tract infection) 
or persistent microscopic haematuria. Even so, it is important to consider other 
causes of haematuria (e.g. bladder transitional cell carcinomas, kidney stones). 
 3.  Diabetic nephropathy: this is now the most common cause of CKD in Australia. 
These patients don ’ t usually undergo a renal biopsy. However, it may be indicated 
in patients with diabetes where non-diabetic renal disease is suspected, for example 
those without micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes, or where the 
duration of diabetes is short. 
 4.  Hypertensive nephropathy: this is an unusual diagnosis. However, most patients with 
CKD are hypertensive and improving blood pressure (BP) control is often a mainstay 
of therapy aimed at slowing the rate of progression of CKD of any cause. Because of its 
place in therapy, detailed knowledge of the patient ’ s blood pressure and its management 
is crucial. Trials have suggested that angioplasty for atheromatous renal artery stenosis 
is no more effective than medical therapy; similarly, despite early enthusiasm, renal 
artery sympathectomy (denervation) has not proven to be effective in most patients with 
resistant hypertension. 
 5.  Analgesic nephropathy: this is now a truly rare condition but patients very occasionally 
turn up at exams. 
 6.  Don ’ t forget to ask about a  family history of kidney disease. Clearly, it is important 
not to miss polycystic kidney disease (see below). However, diabetes, hypertension, 
reﬂ ux nephropathy and various forms of glomerulonephritis (GN) can also have an 
inherited basis. This can be important even when discussing the possibility of living 
related donors for kidney transplantation, for example. 
 7.  Interstitial nephritis: acute interstitial nephritis can be a result of drug allergy, an 
immune reaction or an infection ( Table 11.5 ). It is an important cause of chronic 
interstitial nephritis and CKD. 
 8.  Unknown cause: this group of patients usually present with chronic changes in their 
kidneys or small shrunken kidneys that cannot be safely biopsied. Serological tests 
for causes of kidney diseases are negative. 
 Ascertain treatment details (e.g. antihypertensives, immunosuppressives, antiplatelet 
therapy, dialysis). 
 1.  Diabetic nephropathy: ask about other complications and therapy. An ACEI or 
ARB (but not both) is preferred for all cases with diabetic nephropathy. Th e creatinine 
should be monitored after treatment is begun. An increase in serum creatinine of less 
than 30% is acceptable and may indeed indicate a degree of renal protection – reduced 
glomerular pressure increases the creatinine but protects the kidneys in the long run. 
A rise in creatinine of more than 30% usually means the drug should be stopped.

 HINT 
 Distinguish the nephrotic syndrome ( Table 11.6 ) from the nephritic syndrome 
( Table 11.7 ) and the types of glomerulonephritis (GN) (see  Table 11.4 ). 
 Nephrotic – protein leakage across the glomeruli:
 •  severe proteinuria (urine protein  > 3.5 g / 24 hours) 
 •  hypoalbuminaemia 
 •  oedema. 
 Nephritic – inﬂ ammation or injury within the glomeruli allowing protein, red blood 
cells and white blood cells into the renal tubule; there is:
 •  reduced glomerular ﬁ ltration 
 •  proteinuria 
 •  haematuria, pyuria 
 •  hypertension 
 •  reduced renal function. 
Patients with very low eGFRs ( < 20 mL / min) should have the drug stopped, but if 
there is no improvement in eGFR it can usually be restarted. 
 2.  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD): ask about family history (the condition is usually 
autosomal dominant – called ADPKD), how the disease was diagnosed, haematuria, 
polyuria, loin pain, hypertension, headache, subarachnoid haemorrhages and visual 
disturbance (intracranial aneurysm). 
 Also ask about deafness and a history of persistent haematuria (hereditary nephritis 
– Alport ’ s syndrome). 
 3.  Refl ux nephropathy: ask about childhood renal infections, cystoscopy, operations, 
treatment (e.g. regular antibiotics) and enuresis. 
 4.  Hypertensive nephropathy: ask about how the disease was diagnosed, duration and 
control of hypertension, treatment and compliance with medication, angiography 
and family history. 
 5.  Connective tissue disease: think especially of systemic lupus erythematosus and 
scleroderma. 
 6.  Find out whether the patient is aware of the  long-term prognosis . If he or she is 
not yet on dialysis, has this been discussed? Is the patient likely to be eligible for 
dialysis or the transplant list? 
 7.  Ask when the  underlying condition was  diagnosed and how it is being  treated . 
Th e progression to end-stage kidney disease may be rapid or very prolonged.

Systemic disease – diabetes mellitus (the most common by far), SLE, Hodgkin ’ s disease (minimal 
change), solid tumours (membranous), amyloid, multiple myeloma

endocarditis 
 Drugs –  D -penicillamine, probenecid, non-steroidal anti-inﬂ ammatory drugs, heroin

 QUESTIONS REGARDING MANAGEMENT ( TABLE 11.8 ) 
 1.  Conservative management: 
 a.  Ask about:
 •  follow-up 
 •  medications 
 •  diet 
 •  salt and water allowance 
 •  investigations performed (particularly renal biopsy) 
 •  whether erythropoietin has been given subcutaneously in an attempt to elevate 
the haemoglobin. 
 b.  Has the patient been advised to restrict protein intake? Th ere is controversy about 
the value of protein restriction in delaying end-stage renal failure. Patients with 
nephrotic syndrome should be much less restricted. Th e concern about protein 
restriction is that it leads to more rapid loss of muscle mass without much delay 
in end-stage renal failure. 
 c.  Has potassium restriction been recommended? Potassium accumulates in patients with 
severe CKD and intake is often restricted to 70 mmol / day ( Table 11.9 ). Has the patient 
been told about food that should be avoided because of its potassium content? 
 d.  What eff ect have the disease and the dietary and other restrictions had on the 
patient ’ s quality of life and his or her family? 
 e.  Some kidney disease can be treated and this can at least slow the progression to 
end-stage chronic kidney disease. Ask about specifi c treatment including:
 •  rituximab for induction and relapse and azathioprine for maintenance for 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis

 Table 11.11   Dialysis 
 PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (CAPD OR APD) 
 Advantages 
Simple, reliable and safe (from a cardiovascular point of view). Removes large ﬂ uid 
volumes. Allows greater freedom of diet and ﬂ uid intake. Preferable for diabetics. 
Performed daily rather than a few days a week, can be done at home. Better if unstable 
cardiovascular system. APD exchanges done at night.
 Disadvantages 
Peritonitis, exit-site infections (around catheter). Protein loss (7–10 g / day usually; 
30–40 g / day with peritonitis). Basal atelectasis. Abdominal hernias, obesity and 
previous surgery are contraindications. Does not control uraemia in hypercatabolic 
patients. Hyperglycaemia. Catheter displacement. ‘Peritoneal membrane failure’. 
Perforation of bladder and bowel (rare). Hydrothorax (rare). May develop hernias.
 HAEMODIALYSIS 
 Advantages 
Takes approximately 18 hours per week (4–5 hours three times / week, plus set-up 
time). No protein loss. Large volumes can be ultraﬁ ltrated.
 Disadvantages 
Circulatory access problems (thrombosis, infection of vascular access). Heparin may 
increase bleeding. Increased cardiovascular instability. Anaemia. Osteodystrophy. 
Dialysis dementia (aluminium). Patient less involved in treatment. Dietary compliance 
still needed. Fluid overload and high potassium levels can still be signiﬁ cant problems, 
especially after the longer interval between dialysis sessions each week.
 Note: Mortality from dialysis is caused by myocardial infarction (60%) or sepsis (20%) in most cases. 
Acquired cystic disease in native kidneys may occur;  < 5% are malignant. Arthropathy and carpal tunnel 
syndrome may occur in long-term dialysis patients owing to amyloid (beta 2 -microglobulin) deposition.

 c.  Medications: obtaining an accurate list of medications helps in identifying problems

 i.  erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) – these may be given parenterally on 
dialysis by the dialysis staff  if a patient is on HD 
 ii.  parenteral iron is commonly used in the HD units and intermittently in PD 
patients 
 iii.  phosphate binders (calcium-containing and non-calcium-containing binders) 
 iv.  vitamin D analogues (1,25-OH vitamin D) 
 v.  other vitamins 
 vi.  antihypertensives 
 vii.  also possibly sodium bicarbonate for acidosis. 
 d.  Nutrition: inadequate dialysis can lead to weight loss and malnutrition.
 i.  Dietary advice is commonly required to help manage hyperkalaemia, phosphate 
control and fl uid control (water intake). 
 ii.  As many patients commonly have diabetes, these patients also need advice for 
glucose control. 
 iii.  Sodium restriction and water restriction help BP control. 
 iv.  Hyperlipidaemia and osteoporosis problems can be managed (at least partly) 
with reduction of dietary intake of saturated fats and increase in calcium intake. 
 e.  Other questions to ask should include:
 i.  Is the dialysis patient on the transplant list? If the transplant is planned in the 
short term, there may be less need for permanent haemodialysis vascular access. 
 ii.  Does the patient have an advance care directive (‘living will’)? 
 iii.  Has the patient been immunosuppressed previously (e.g. for treatment of previous 
glomerulonephritis or a previous transplant)? Th is may increase the risk of 
malignancies or infections. 
 3.  Transplant patients: for patients with recent transplants, ask about:
 •  graft pain or swelling (failure of graft function, rejection) 
 •  infection 
 •  urine leaks 
 •  steroid and immunosuppression side-eff ects. 
 For those with long-term renal grafts, ask about:
 •  serum creatinine levels 
 •  proteinuria 
 •  recurrent glomerulonephritis (dense deposit disease) 
 •  avascular necrosis 
 •  skin cancer 
 •  refl ux nephropathy. 
 Find out about adherence to drugs and whether the patient knows about rejection 
episodes and treatment (e.g. with pulsed-dose steroids or muromonab-CD3). 
 The examination ( Table 11.12 ) 
 A complete physical examination is always essential. Look particularly for the following.
 1.  General appearance – mental state, hyperventilation, Kussmaul ’ s breathing, hiccupping, 
the state of hydration and tachypnoea from fl uid overload. Ask the patient to show 
you any old scars from access sites, transplant or other surgery.

(lymphoma, cytomegalovirus or other infections if the patient is immunosuppressed),

 7.  Urine – for blood, protein, specifi c gravity, pH, glucose, urine microscopy and

 Investigations 
 1.  Determine renal function:
 a.  glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) – creatinine clearance (creatinine clearance levels of 
 < 10 mL / min are considered indications for dialysis) and plasma creatinine / urea level; 
the eGFR is routinely calculated by laboratories and the patient may know these results

 b.  tubular function – plasma electrolyte levels, urine specifi c gravity and pH, glycosuria, 
serum potassium, serum phosphate and uric acid, aminoaciduria, serum calcium 
and plasma albumin levels 
 c.  urine analysis and urinary protein excretion (protein-to-creatinine ratio) 
 d.  others if necessary – CT scan for renal artery stenosis or urinary tract obstruction 
(think about the risks of the contrast). 
 2.  Determine renal structure:
 a.  ultrasound – renal size and symmetry, signs of obstruction; small kidneys (suggest 
chronic disease) and the presence or absence of ureteric jets – indicating patent ureters 
 b.  CT scan – if contrast is to be used; hydration with IV saline does off er some renal 
protection; now, even the use of normal saline loading before and after the use of 
contrast material is of uncertain benefi t 
 c.  cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography 
 d.  other – renal artery Doppler study, CT renal angiography. 
 3.  Consider investigations aimed at assessing the widespread eff ects of CKD – blood 
count; serum ferritin and iron saturation level; midstream urine examination; calcium, 
phosphate and alkaline phosphatase levels; parathyroid hormone level; nerve conduction 
studies; arterial Doppler studies. 
 4.  Decide whether there are features that favour chronic over acute kidney disease: 
nocturia, polyuria, longstanding hypertension, renal osteodystrophy, peripheral 
neuropathy, anaemia, hyperphosphataemia and hyperuricaemia. Th e diff erentiation 
of acute and chronic renal failure is also aided by determining kidney size. Kidneys 
are usually small in chronic kidney disease, but the exceptions to this rule include:
 •  diabetic nephropathy (early) 
 •  polycystic kidneys 
 •  obstructive uropathy 
 •  acute renal vein thrombosis 
 •  amyloidosis 
 •  rarely other infi ltrative diseases (e.g. lymphoma), which can all produce CKD but 
maintain normal kidney size. 
 In general, however, kidneys enlarge or maintain normal size in acute kidney disease 
and are small in CKD. 
 5.  Look for anaemia and the presence of burr cells in the peripheral blood fi lm, which 
are usually indicative of CKD but may also occur in acute renal failure (e.g. in SLE), 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome. 
 6.  Always ask about previous urine analyses, such as insurance examinations, in which 
proteinuria may have been detected and followed up, thus giving a clue about chronic 
glomerulonephritis. 
 7.  Consider investigations aimed towards the likely underlying disease process – measure-
ment of antinuclear antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C, HIV, complement, 
immune complexes, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis as well as urinary kappa 
and lamda light chains, micturating cystogram, urine cytology and renal biopsy. 
 Treatment 
 Th is most chronic disease ( Table 11.13 ) has profound eff ects on the patient and his or 
her relatives. Th e association between the patient and the renal physician and nursing 
staff  becomes a very intense one, often lasting many years. It is important to ask detailed 
questions about the way the patient copes with the condition, whether work and travel 
are possible, and what the patient feels about the long-term prospects. Also, ask whether 
a dialysis patient has considered accepting a kidney from a live donor.

 Table 11.13   Complications and treatment of chronic kidney disease 
 ANAEMIA 
Causes include erythropoietin deﬁ ciency, poor nutrition (especially folate deﬁ ciency), blood loss, reduced 
iron absorption, haemolysis, bone marrow depression, chronic disease and aluminium toxicity. 
 Treatment should include prophylactic folate supplements for dialysis patients. Erythropoietin is very effective 
for the chronic anaemia of renal failure and can normalise the haematocrit. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents 
(ESAs) are commonly used in conjunction with intravenous iron supplements given IV late in dialysis (as oral 
iron is poorly absorbed in end-stage renal disease). The serum ferritin should be maintained at  > 100 but less 
than 600, and transferrin saturation at  > 20%. The target haemoglobin should be between 100 and 120  μ g / L.
 BONE DISEASE 
Maintenance of normal calcium and phosphate levels is the key to preventing the problem. 
 Treatment with phosphate binders (e.g. calcium carbonate, sevelamer, lanthanum or sucroferric (to 
bind phosphate in the gut), vitamin D analogues and low calcium concentration in dialysis ﬂ uids is 
necessary. Aluminium is no longer used as a phosphate binder. 
 1.  Osteomalacia – diagnosis by:
 a.  X-ray ﬁ lms (decreased density, Looser ’ s zones) 
 b.  low calcium, phosphate and vitamin D levels 
 c.  high serum alkaline phosphatase level 
 2.  Tertiary hyperparathyroidism – diagnosis by:
 a.  X-ray ﬁ lm (microcysts on radial side of the middle phalanx, erosion of the clavicular ends, ‘rugger 
jersey’ spine (see  Fig. 11.2 ), telescoped terminal phalanges, metastatic calciﬁ cation of vessels) a 
 b.  high phosphate and very high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and a high calcium level 
 3.  Osteoporosis 
 4.  Osteosclerosis 
 5.  Aluminium-induced bone disease 
 6.  Adynamic bone disease (reduced bone formation) is the most common type of bone disease in dialysis 
patients owing to over-suppression by phosphate binders;  note: PTH is low 
 PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY 
This is now uncommon in patients receiving adequate dialysis. It is more often a result of diabetes than of 
CKD itself. Combined pancreatic islet and renal transplant may help.
 HYPERTENSION 
This needs careful monitoring and control of salt and ﬂ uid balance as well as judicious use of 
antihypertensive drugs (an ACEI or ARB slows disease progression).
 INFECTION 
These patients are at risk of infection because of the kidney disease itself, the immunosuppressive drugs 
given to treat glomerulonephritis and their need for frequent intravenous vascular access.
 ACIDOSIS 
This is often treated with dialysis and carefully monitored. Sodium bicarbonate often helps.
 HYPERKALAEMIA 
This should be treated with a low-potassium diet and ion-exchange resins if necessary. Dialysis is very effective.
 a This is now a rare occurrence. Increased PTH that does not respond to medical treatment is managed with 
parathyroidectomy.

 2.  Monitor and control the blood pressure very carefully. Treat lipids. 
 3.  Carefully attend to salt and water balance and acidosis. 
 4.  Normalise the calcium and phosphate levels with diet, phosphate binders or calcitriol. 
Non-calcium-based phosphate binders (e.g. sevelamer) improve mortality compared with 
calcium-based ones. Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism with the drug cinacalcet 
has not been shown to improve mortality or risk of vascular events in dialysis patients. 
 5.  Restrict dietary protein. However, although this may delay slightly the need for dialysis, 
it leads to wasting and protein malnutrition. It is no longer universally recommended. 
 6.  Assess and treat sexual dysfunction. 
 7.  Dialyse when indicated (see below). 
 8.  Consider transplantation. 
 Th e absolute indications for dialysis (see  Table 11.11 ) are:
 1.  uraemic symptoms despite conservative management (eGFR about 7 mL / min) 
 2.  volume overload despite salt and water restriction and diuretic use 
 3.  hyperkalaemia unresponsive to conservative measures

 4.  progressive deterioration of renal function (dialyse before symptoms develop) 
 5.  acute renal failure (dialyse early). 
 Note: Dialysis may be started earlier to avoid these complications, but there is no 
evidence that mortality is improved by this strategy. 
 DIALYSIS 
 It is very important to consider that patients may not be suitable for dialysis or may 
have unrealistic expectations of the benefi ts of dialysis. Patient education about dialysis 
options and non-dialysis management is necessary in a timely manner for all patients 
with worsening CKD. 
 Not all end-stage CKD patients should be dialysed. Consider:
 1.  age and co-morbidities 
 2.  conservative treatment 
 3.  type of dialysis 
 4.  suitability for later transplant 
 5.  lack of benefi t in starting before symptoms have occurred. 
 Patient ’ s wishes 
 Find out their wishes and assess how well informed they are if possible. Patients with 
a number of co-morbidities who are over 75 have a poor survival (80% 3-year mortality) 
whether dialysed or not. Seventy per cent of nursing home patients started on dialysis 
have died within 12 months. Peritoneal dialysis gives patients a slight survival advantage 
over haemodialysis, but only for the fi rst year. 
 Remember the common complications of dialysis:
 1.  sudden cardiac death 
 2.  vascular disease 
 3.  extravascular calcifi cation – accelerated aortic stenosis, calciphylaxis 
 4.  amyloidosis ( β 2 -microglobulin). 
 A number of dialysis trials are been undertaken including high-dose versus low-dose 
dialysis, high fl ux versus low fl ux, increased frequency of haemodialysis, and haemodia-
fi ltration versus haemodialysis. Th ese strategies haven ’ t shown evidence of survival benefi t. 
 ANTICOAGULATION 
 Atrial fi brillation is common in CKD and dialysis patients. Th eir risk of stroke is high 
and warfarin reduces this risk by 14%, but the price is an increased risk (of 44%) of 
signifi cant bleeding. Th e decision to recommend anticoagulation is a complicated one 
and depends on an individual analysis of the bleeding and stroke risk. Th e role of the 
newer anticoagulants (NOACs) is uncertain in patients with CKD stages 4–5; apixaban 
has been approved in the United States for dialysis patients. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Is  this patient a candidate for a renal transplant? 
 2.  At what point do you think  this patient will require dialysis? Would you recommend 
peritoneal or haemodialysis? Why? 
 3.  How adherent do you think  this patient is with his or her treatment recommendations? 
 4.  How would you investigate  this patient with newly diagnosed chronic kidney disease 
to establish the aetiology? Do you think there are any reversible factors?

 1.  Look particularly at the skin for squamous and basal cell carcinomas. 
 2.  Note any signs of Cushing ’ s syndrome and hirsutism (e.g. from cyclosporin). 
 3.  Examine the abdomen carefully, noting the position and site of the allograft and 
whether it has any tenderness or bruits. Don ’ t forget to look for scars from previous 
transplants, too! Were these non-functioning organs removed or not? 
 4.  Look for old vascular access sites for haemodialysis and decide whether there will be 
problems fi nding sites for access for further dialysis if this is required. 
 5.  Examine the lungs for signs of infection and the mouth for  Candida . Inspect the 
gums. Note gouty tophi. Look at the temperature chart. 
 Investigations 
 1.  It is important to obtain the serum creatinine level and, if possible, establish whether 
the serum creatinine level has been rising or falling since the time of transplantation. 
A slightly elevated creatinine level is considered acceptable in patients treated with 
calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) as these drugs interfere with renal function. Patients 
usually know their creatinine and eGFR results. If they don ’ t, there may be some 
doubt about their adherence with treatment and understanding of their disease. 
 2.  Th e electrolyte levels and liver function test results are important. Cyclosporin can 
cause hepatotoxicity and renal impairment, as can cytomegalovirus infection of the 
liver. A white cell count should be obtained to look for leukocytosis (infection or 
steroids) and leukopenia (e.g. excessive doses of mycophenolate, mTOR inhibitors, 
azathioprine, valganciclovir or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination). 
 Th ese drugs ’ doses are usually adjusted according to the neutrophil count. Th e 
haemoglobin is usually normal in patients with a successful transplant and good function. 
 3.  Th e results of blood cultures should be sought if there has been any suggestion of 
recent infection. Urinary tract infection must also be considered and early urine 
microscopy is helpful. 
 4.  Consider viral infections with PCR testing for, for example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
and BK virus – these can alter the white cell count and renal function.

 5.  Exclude prerenal and postrenal disease. A renal scan and ultrasound with measurement 
by Doppler is useful for estimating renal artery blood fl ow. 
 Management 
 1.  Th e majority of patients receiving chronic dialysis are candidates for renal transplanta-
tion; the contraindications are listed in  Table 11.14 . Generally, transplantation improves 
patients’ quality of life and is less expensive than dialysis over time. 
 2.  Most patients are given three immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplants. Th e 
most common combination is prednisolone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. 
Cyclosporin and azathioprine are much less common fi rst-choice agents as they have 
been shown to be less eff ective. Monoclonal antibodies are commonly used for induction 
therapy at the time of surgery. 
 mTOR inhibitors are also commonly used and patients may be changed to these 
agents especially if calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. tacrolimus and cyclosporin) have caused 
renal transplant toxicity. Th ey may be specifi cally indicated to reduce skin and other 
malignancies. However, their use is associated with poor wound healing, leukopenia, 
hyperlipidaemia and proteinuria. Hence these agents should be stopped before surgery 
and restarted after healing is complete. Often the patients have to be changed back 
to a CNI temporarily over this period. 
 Immunosuppressants include:
 a.  Mycophenalate mofetil can be used with allopurinol, and can cause leukopenia 
as well as upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, weight loss) or more commonly 
diarrhoea; typical doses are 500–1000 mg twice daily (CellCept) or 360–720 mg 
twice daily. 
 b.  Tacrolimus is a CNI. Trough levels should be monitored (5–10 ng / mL). It can 
cause renal dysfunction, alopecia and hypertension but (unlike cyclosporin) not 
gout, hirsutism or gum changes. 
 c.  Sirolimus and  everolimus are mTOR inhibitors, given daily orally. Th eir adverse 
eff ects include a reduced white cell count (use with caution in combination with 
mycophenalate), increased lipids and proteinuria. Monitor trough levels. Th ey 
delay wound healing and should be replaced before surgery with tacrolimus and 
restarted when wound healing has been achieved (typically 1–3 months later). 
 d.  Azathioprine has largely been replaced by mycophenalate (resulting in less acute 
rejection), but some patients with older transplants may still be taking azathioprine. 
 e.  Prednisone is given in maintenance doses of approximately 7.5–10 mg daily after 
about 6 months and usually 5 mg/day by 12 months post-transplant surgery.

 3.  Prophylactic anti-infective medications include:
 a.  Most if not all new transplant patients are treated with oral valganciclovir for CMV 
prophylaxis for the fi rst 6 months post-surgery. 
 b.  Prophylaxis for  Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
– it has been recommended that this agent be continued forever, owing to the risk 
of late  Pneumocystis infections. Atovaquone may be a suitable alternative, in cases 
of toxicity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. 
 c.  Th e infl uenza vaccine is recommended in all suitable patients. 
 d.  Opportunistic infections typically occur a month or more post-transplant.  Toxoplasma , 
 Nocardia and  Aspergillus are now less common with current immunosuppressive 
protocols; viral infections (especially CMV) dominate. Infection must be aggressively 
diagnosed (e.g. by blood cultures and lung biopsy) and treated. When infections 
are life-threatening, immunosuppressive treatment, apart from prednisone, should 
be suspended. CMV prophylaxis with ganciclovir (for CMV-negative patients with 
a CMV-positive donor) and PCP prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole may be 
indicated. 
 4.  Acute rejection episodes: these are still treated with pulsed high-dose steroids and 
usually an increase in the general level of immunosuppression ( Table 11.15 ).

transplants. Th ey may have additional problems with pancreatic drainage (bladder 
or to gut) and leakage.

 6.  Find out what treatments have been tried and with what success and any side-eff ects. 
Various unproven treatments are often tried by patients with this incurable disease. 
Ask whether any of these have been used. 
 HINT 
 Unlike patients with cerebrovascular disease, MS patients do not develop cortical 
symptoms such as neglect and aphasia. However, cognitive dysfunction is frequently 
overlooked as a source of disability, especially in SPMS. 
 The examination 
 1.  Th e signs can be very variable. Focus on the reported symptoms and look for signs 
related to them. Look particularly for signs of spastic paraparesis and posterior column 
sensory loss, as well as cerebellar signs. You must objectively quantify the main 
neurological defi cit and any eff ect on function. 
 2.  Examine the cranial nerves. Look carefully for loss of visual acuity, optic atrophy or 
swelling. Check colour saturation and look for a relative aff erent pupil defect (RAPD), 
especially if acuity is reduced. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is an important sign and 
is almost diagnostic in a young adult. It can also occur in patients with SLE or 
Sjögren ’ s syndrome, who may have disease confi ned to the CNS, or with brain stem 
tumours or infarcts. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is weakness of adduction in one 
eye as a result of damage to the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus; there is 
nystagmus in the abducting eye. In MS, internuclear ophthalmoplegia is often bilateral. 
Other cranial nerves may rarely be aff ected by lesions within the brain stem (III, IV, 
V, VI, VII, pseudobulbar palsy). 
 3.  Test for Lhermitte ’ s sign (an electric-shock-like sensation in the limbs or trunk 
following neck fl exion). Th is can also be caused by other disorders of the cervical 
spine, such as subacute combined degeneration of the cord, cervical spondylosis, 
cervical cord tumour, foramen magnum tumours, nitrous oxide abuse and mantle 
irradiation. 
 4.  Rarely, signs suggesting neuromyelitis optica (NMO, or Devic ’ s disease) are present 
(unilateral or bilateral optic neuritis and transverse myelitis occurring within a few 
weeks of one another). Patients are typically children or young adults. Patients may 
experience the sudden onset of visual loss and pain on eye movements, associated 
with weakness, numbness and sometimes paresis of the arms or legs, along with 
sensory disturbances and loss of bladder and bowel control. Unlike MS there is no

cerebellar or cognitive impairment and the brain MRI is usually normal, though 
brain stem lesions can also be seen in some patients. Th e presence of specifi c aquaporin-4 
antibodies in up to 70% of patients helps distinguish the condition from MS. NMO 
is pathologically very diff erent to MS, and requires diff erent treatment. 
 Investigations 
 Th e diff erential diagnosis of multiple CNS lesions includes:
 •  SLE 
 •  Sjögren ’ s syndrome 
 •  Behçet ’ s disease 
 •  small vessel ischaemia 
 •  acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
 •  meningovascular syphilis 
 •  paraneoplastic eff ects of carcinoma 
 •  sarcoidosis 
 •  multiple emboli from any source. 
 It is important to distinguish MS aff ecting predominantly the spinal cord from other 
diseases – especially subacute combined degeneration of the cord (more common in the 
older population) and spinal cord compression presenting with root pain and persistent 
levels of sensory loss. 
 MS is essentially a clinical diagnosis, but the following tests may be helpful.
 1.  MRI is the imaging modality of choice ( Fig. 12.1 ).  Table 12.1 lists the typical sites 
of changes. Typical changes are present in the great majority of patients with MS. 
Gadolinium contrast studies show leakage into the brain from blood vessels for up 
to some months after the formation of a new lesion. T2-weighted images will show 
persisting changes that are probably due to a combination of oedema, gliosis and 
infl ammation. Th e extent of these abnormalities – the burden of disease – correlates 
to some extent with the clinical severity, though brain stem and spinal cord lesions 
cause particular disability. Th e presence of numerous gadolinium-enhancing lesions 
indicates a worse prognosis. CT scan may reveal low-density, sometimes contrast-
enhancing, plaques in white matter (subcortical or periventricular, but only in 10%–50% 
of cases). CT scanning is no longer in routine use for diagnosis of MS. 
 2.  Visual-evoked responses are delayed in 80% of established cases and indicate previous 
optic neuritis (important if there is only one other clinically detectable lesion present). 
Auditory-evoked responses and somatosensory-evoked responses may be abnormal, 
but are not usually diagnostic. 
 3.  Cerebrospinal fl uid in chronic MS contains oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
bands (70%) and an altered IgG:albumin ratio. Myelin basic protein may be elevated 
in acute demyelination. Th ere are usually  < 50 white cells per millilitre in the cerebro-
spinal fl uid, but acute severe demyelination may result in a cell count  > 100 / mL. 
 4.  Antimyelin antibodies are of uncertain value. 
 A defi nite diagnosis is not possible without the presence of two or more CNS episodes, 
usually separated in time and place; the fi rst may be a clinical abnormality and the second 
detected by MRI or visual-evoked responses (Macdonald ’ s criteria –  Table 12.2 ). Th ese 
include objective CNS changes, usually involving long-tract signs and symptoms: pyramidal, 
cerebellar, optic nerve, posterior columns and medial longitudinal fasciculus. Gradual 
progression of symptoms may be used to make the diagnosis if typical cerebrospinal fl uid 
(CSF) abnormalities are present. Th e MRI should show four distinct areas of abnormal-
ity at least 3 mm in diameter. Th ere should be no other explanation for the symptoms 
(see above). 
 
 
336
Examination Medicine
 Treatment 
 Th ere are two aspects to treatment of these patients:
 1.  supportive and symptomatic treatment 
 2.  immunomodulation / immunosuppression. 
 In addition, there are many support groups and organisations for patients with MS. 
Th ese often give sensible advice to these distressed people and should be recommended 
to patients. It is most important, however, that the diagnosis is secure before patients 
are labelled with this condition with its numerous long-term implications.
 1.  Th e course of the disease:
 a.  relapsing–remitting MS: relapses with or without complete recovery, but stable 
between episodes; off er early disease-modifying therapy 
 b.  secondary progressive MS: about half of the patients with relapsing–remitting 
MS develop secondary progressive MS within 10 years; they experience gradual 
progression of their symptoms without distinct episodes 
 c.  primary progressive MS: these patients have increasing symptoms without distinct 
episodes from the start and there are no disease-modifying therapies as yet 
 d.  progressive relapsing MS: in these patients there is gradual worsening, with episodes 
of deterioration occurring later in the course of the illness. 
 2.  General support is essential. During exacerbations, bed rest with meticulous nursing 
is vital. Treatment of bladder dysfunction, severe spasticity (e.g. with baclofen), urgency 
(e.g. with amitriptyline), tic douloureux and facial spasm (e.g. with carbamazepine

and physiotherapy) is important. Intention tremor can be treated with propranolol 
or clonazepam. 
 3.  Drug treatment: ( Table 12.3 ) immunomodulators and immunosuppressants:
 a.  Interferon (IFN)  β 1a and interferon  β 1b have been shown to reduce the frequency of 
exacerbations by about one-third when used at an early stage of disease, and to reduce 
the accumulation of CNS white matter lesions. Th ey are more eff ective for the relapsing 
forms of the disease (see below). Th ere is evidence that these drugs improve survival. 
Remember the risk of hepatotoxicity and leukopenia; monitor blood tests. 
 b.  Glatiramer acetate (subcutaneous) takes up to a year to provide benefi t; the drug 
can induce non-cardiac chest pain or shortness of breath. It is of similar effi  cacy 
to interferon. Bradycardia can be a problem. 
 c.  Natalizumab (monoclonal antibody to alpha 4 -integrin) is more eff ective than these 
agents, especially for RRMS, but its use is restricted to patients with very aggressive 
disease because 1 in 600 patients treated develop progressive multifocal leukoen-
cephalopathy (PML) owing to brain infection with the John Cunningham agent. 
A  negative JC virus ( JCV) antibody test means a very low risk (1 in 10,000) of 
developing PML. A JCV- positive patient who has had previous treatment with 
immunosuppressing drugs and more than 2 years of natalizumab treatment has a 
1 in 90 chance of developing PML. 
 d.  Ocrelizumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody infusion for RRMS. It can 
reactivate hepatitis B so you must screen for HBsAg and anti-HBc prior to prescribing. 
 Table 12.2   Macdonald ’ s criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis 
The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires establishing disease disseminated in both space and time.
 DISSEMINATION IN SPACE 
Dissemination in space requires  ≥ 1 T2 bright lesions in two or more of the following locations: 
 • 
 periventricular 
 • 
 juxtacortical 
 • 
 infratentorial 
 • 
 spinal cord 
 If a patient has a brain stem / spinal cord syndrome, the symptomatic lesion(s) are excluded from the 
criteria, not contributing to the lesion count. 
 DISSEMINATION IN TIME 
Dissemination in time can be established in one of two ways: 
 • 
 a new lesion when compared with a previous scan (irrespective of timing) 
 • 
 T2 bright lesion and / or gadolinium enhancing 
 • 
 presence of asymptomatic enhancing lesion and a non-enhancing T2 bright lesion on any one scan. 
 PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (PPMS) 
In addition to the above criteria, the diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis has also been 
revised. The diagnosis now requires: 
 • 
 ≥ 1 year of disease progression (this can be determined either prospectively or retrospectively) 
 • 
 plus two of the following three criteria:
 • 
 brain dissemination in space ( ≥ 1 T2 bright lesions in  ≥ 1 of juxtacortical, periventricular, 
infratentorial areas) 
 • 
 spinal cord dissemination in space ( ≥ 2 T2 bright lesions) 
 • 
 positive CSF (oligoclonal bands and / or elevated IgG index).

 e.  Fingolimod is an oral agent. It works via the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor to 
prevent lymphocyte tracking through lymph nodes. It causes reversible lymphopenia. 
It has been shown to be more eff ective than interferon, with relapse rates of 25% at 
2 years. Side-eff ects include macular oedema and increased infection risk. It should 
not be given to people without varicella immunisation or known previous exposure 
and immunity. Patients should also be screened for herpes simplex, hepatitis serology 
and TB exposure. Th e ECG should be monitored for 6 hours for QT prolongation 
and arrhythmias with fi rst dosing. PML has been described in a handful of patients.

12 • The neurological long case
 f.  Terifl unomide is the active metabolite of lefl unomide. It is probably less eff ective 
than the other oral drugs but has predictable if unpleasant side-eff ects. Hair loss 
and gut upset are common; haematological and liver abnormalities are rare. It is 
important to monitor for skin malignancy. 
 g.  Dimethyl fumarate has had good trial results. It is generally well tolerated. Severe 
lymphopenia can occur but is rare; fl ushing and gut upset are common but often 
improve with time. 
 h.  Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against CD52, with high potency and 
limited need for regular dosing. However, B-cell-mediated autoimmunity is a 
problem in the early phase post-dose; autoimmune thyroid disease, anti-glomerular 
basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic 
purpura (ITP) have all been described. 
 i.  Prior to monoclonal therapies, patients may have been treated with methotrexate, 
azathioprine, cyclophosphamide or mitoxantrone. Mitoxantrone was particularly 
used in the past in patients with rapidly progressive disease, but cardiac toxicity 
and subsequent malignancy limited its use. Occasionally, autologous stem cell 
transplant has been used. 
 RELAPSES 
 Pseudorelapses are an exacerbation or recurrence of previously improved symptoms and 
are related to an intercurrent infection. Treatment of the infection is indicated.
 1.  Acute ‘true’ relapses are treated with methylprednislone – 500–1000 mg / day for three doses 
if they are severe (impair mobility, vision, etc.). Plasmapheresis and intravenous gamma 
globulin may help relapses when steroids fail. Treatment of relapses may hasten recovery, 
but does not improve the long-term outlook or reduce the risk of further relapses. 
 2.  At 15 years after the fi rst episode, 80% of patients have signifi cant symptoms that 
prevent them from working and require help with normal activities. If the initial 
episode is limited to a single abnormality and the MRI is normal, only 10% will go 
on to develop a second episode over the following 10 years. If the MRI is abnormal, 
up to 80% will experience further episodes. 
 3.  Consider symptomatic management: there are a range of medications which can 
address spasticity, walking, bladder dysfunction and fatigue. Make sure you have a 
plan and can at least provide an overview of the available treatments every general 
physician should know. 
 4.  As with all chronic and debilitating diseases, a discussion about the patient ’ s expectations 
and prognosis and plans for the future is important. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Please summarise the course of  this patient ’ s symptoms of multiple sclerosis. 
 2.  What treatments have been tried? 
 3.  What do you think future possibilities for treatment for  this patient are? 
 4.  How would you explain the possible side-effects that future treatment would involve? 
 5.  What would you advise  this woman patient about the implications of pregnancy? 
 6.  What is the impact on function and quality of life in this patient with MS? How 
would you address the issues?

 Myasthenia gravis 
 Th is chronic autoimmune disease presents both diagnostic and management problems. 
Peak incidence in women is in the third decade of life, but in men it is in the seventh 
decade. Overall it is more common in women than in men (2 : 1). Exacerbations and 
remissions (incomplete) are common. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about symptoms at presentation:
 a.  ocular – diplopia (90%), drooping eyelids 
 b.  bulbar – choking (weakness of pharyngeal muscles), dysarthria, diffi  culty (especially 
fatigue) when chewing or swallowing 
 c.  neck – dropped head 
 d.  limb girdle – proximal muscle weakness; there is fatigue on exertion and prompt 
partial recovery on resting. 
 2.  Ask about a history of diffi  cult anaesthesia (owing to prolonged weakness after muscle 
relaxation) and past episodes of pneumonia (as a result of bulbar and respiratory 
weakness). 
 3.  Determine how the diagnosis was made, including whether electrodiagnostic studies 
were done and whether the patient had blood tests for acetylcholine receptor 
antibodies. 
 4.  Ask about a history of thymectomy (i.e. previous treatment for myasthenia). 
 5.  Enquire about other treatment – including drug dose and when the last dose was 
taken, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange or immunosuppressive therapy. 
 6.  Ask about drug use, which may interfere with neuromuscular transmission (see below). 
 7.  Ask about other organ-specifi c autoimmune disease associations (e.g. SLE, RA). 
 8.  Enquire about the social history. 
 The examination 
 1.  Examine for muscle fatigue, particularly the elevators of the eyelids and the oculomotor 
muscles (tested by sustained upward gaze), bulbar muscles (tested by counting or 
reading aloud) and the proximal limb girdles (tested by holding the arms above the 
head). 
 2.  Look for the peek sign (orbicularis oculi weakness – ask the patient to close his or 
her eyes and keep them closed; within 30 seconds in myasthenia they will begin to 
separate and you will see the lower sclera). 
 3.  Asking the patient to smile may produce a snarling expression. Speech on prolonged 
speaking may sound dysarthric or nasal because of weakness of the palate. 
 4.  Weakness of neck fl exion may be prominent. 
 5.  Flap one arm for 10–30 seconds and then test shoulder strength together. 
 6.  Look for a thymectomy scar. 
 7.  Refl exes are preserved, there is no sensory loss and muscle atrophy is usually minimal. 
 Investigations 
 Th e  ice pack test can be performed at the bedside if there is ptosis: fi ll a surgical glove 
with ice and place it on the closed eyelid for 2 minutes – if ptosis improves this is 
suggestive, but not diagnostic, of myasthenia. 
 Laboratory tests for myasthenia gravis ( Fig. 12.2 ) include the following.
 1.  Acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Ab) – these occur in 80%–90% of cases, 
with false-positive results being rare (but the frequency of positive tests is lower in 
 
 
341
12 • The neurological long case
pure ocular and inactive myasthenia gravis). Th e titre is not directly related to disease 
severity. Muscle-specifi c kinase antibodies (MuSK) are present in half of those AChR-Ab 
negative. Occasionally only antibodies to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 4 (LRP4) are positive (1%); seronegative disease can occur (6%). 
 2.  Electromyogram (EMG) – in myasthenia gravis, repetitive stimulation at low frequencies 
causes an asymptotic reduction (there is progressively less reduction with each shock) 
in muscle action potential amplitudes if that particular muscle is aff ected. Needle 
examination of aff ected muscles shows motor unit potential variation and, sometimes, 
fi brillation potentials and myopathic change. Single-fi bre EMG shows increased jitter 
and blocking. 
 3.  Th ymoma investigations – chest X-ray, thoracic CT scan or MRI. 
 4.  Associated conditions – hyperthyroidism and autoimmune diseases (check thyroid 
function tests, rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies). 
 5.  Respiratory function tests – these patients may have severe respiratory impairment. 
 Differential diagnosis 
 Th e diff erential diagnosis of proximal muscle weakness is important. Th e ocular muscle 
dystrophies also need to be considered. Th e Lambert–Eaton syndrome is occasionally 
confused with myasthenia gravis. Th is syndrome results from presynaptic failure of 
release of acetylcholine, caused by small cell carcinoma of the lung (in 50% of cases) 
or autoimmune disease. In the Lambert–Eaton syndrome:
 •  there is proximal muscle weakness and pain, and power may increase on repeated 
eff ort; refl exes are reduced or absent 
 •  the ocular and bulbar muscles are usually spared 
 •  the EMG is helpful (high-frequency stimulation causes an increment, whereas low-
frequency stimulation causes a decrement and muscle action potential amplitudes 
are low).

Examination Medicine
 Symptoms may be reduced by 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP: safe and eff ective) or 
guanidine; steroids and plasma-exchange therapy can also be eff ective. Some patients 
with small cell carcinoma of the lung have a neurological remission if the tumour is 
completely removed. Treatment with  D -penicillamine may cause a mild reversible form 
of myasthenia. 
 Treatment 
 Th e prognosis of myasthenia gravis is good: 50% of patients have a remission, although 
5%–10% die from respiratory failure. 
 SYMPTOMATIC 
 1.  Anticholinesterases are the mainstay of treatment in mild cases. Pyridostigmine is the 
usual one prescribed. Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. 
spironolactone) may give additional improvement, but are rarely used these days. 
 2.  It is important to avoid drugs that interfere with neuromuscular transmission, including 
streptomycin, gentamicin, 1 quinidine and procainamide. Immunise to prevent respiratory 
infections because of potential respiratory compromise (avoid live-attenuated fl u or 
varicella-zoster vaccines if using immunosuppressive treatment). 
 3.  Sudden worsening of the patient ’ s symptoms so as to be life-threatening (because of 
respiratory failure) is called a myasthenic crisis. It is often precipitated by infection, 
which must be treated aggressively with antibiotics (though some, especially amino-
glycosides, worsen myasthenia) and intensive respiratory support. Mechanical ventilation 
and a course of plasmapheresis may be required. 
 4.  Sometimes the problem may be excessive anticholinesterase treatment (cholinergic 
crisis). Temporary suspension of drug treatment and monitoring of muscle strength 
may be all that is required for these episodes. 
 DISEASE-SUPPRESSING 
 1.  Steroids are indicated for generalised severe disease when anticholinesterases are 
inadequate. Th ey are then needed in the long term. Th ey may aggravate disease 
initially (in the fi rst week to 10 days), so all patients should be observed closely when 
treatment is commenced. 
 2.  Failed steroid treatment in patients with severe disease is an indication for immunosup-
pressive drug therapy (e.g. azathioprine, cyclosporin, mycophenolate). Azathioprine 
has been shown to be eff ective as a steroid-sparing agent and to reduce relapses and 
prolong remissions, but it should not be used as initial management or on its own. 
 3.  Th ymectomy is advisable early on for many patients with generalised myasthenia 
gravis if they are AChR antibody positive. Th e exceptions are elderly patients or those 
with an easily inducible remission. Th ymomas occur in 10% of cases (and, of these, 
25% are malignant) and thymic hyperplasia occurs in 65%. Of such patients, after 
resection 70% show improvement and 25% of those who improve undergo remission. 
Causes of failed response to thymectomy include incomplete removal, ectopic tissue 
and fulminant disease. 
 4.  Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) can reverse a severe, life-threatening episode or 
refractory disease. Rituximab has been tried in desperate cases. Th is chimeric antibody 
attaches to the CD20 membrane site of B lymphocytes and attracts T-killer cells and 
antibodies that destroy the lymphocytes making the pathological antibodies. 
 1 Th e restriction of use of antibiotics is controversial and many neurologists advise that there is little risk 
that can ’ t be managed and that patients should receive the antibiotic indicated for their infection. 
 
 
343
12 • The neurological long case
 5.  Plasmapheresis is useful in acute situations such as in myasthenic crisis, preparation for 
surgery or in the peripartum period. Very ill patients may need repeated treatments. 
Removal of the antibody from the blood in this way usually leads to rapid improvement. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Is there a possible differential diagnosis for  this patient ’ s muscle weakness and 
fatigue? 
 2.  How would you investigate it? 
 3.  Is screening for malignancy indicated for  this patient? 
 Guillain–Barré syndrome 
 Acute infl ammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is not infrequent in the 
examination, as patients may be in hospital for an extended period and present manage-
ment diffi  culties. It is the most common acute polyneuropathy and can aff ect both sexes 
and all ages. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about the presenting symptoms of ascending motor weakness, their time course 
and whether they are decreasing or increasing. Th e patient may report diffi  culty in 
breathing. Other symptoms include paraesthesiae or sensory loss (sensory neuropathy 
is usually minimal) and symptoms of cranial nerve palsies, particularly bulbar lesions 
(all cranial nerves except I, II and VIII can be aff ected). Back pain is a common 
complaint and may be intractable initially. 
 2.  Ask about a preceding respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (which occurs in up 
to 50% of cases 1–3 weeks beforehand –  Campylobacter , mycoplasma, EBV and 
infl uenza). Also enquire about other precipitating events, such as surgical operation, 
vaccination, intercurrent malignant disease (e.g. Hodgkin disease), SLE and HIV 
infection. 
 3.  Find out how severe the disease has been at its worst. Some patients fi nd themselves 
in ICU for many months with a prolonged and tortuous recovery. Th is may have 
signifi cant impacts on how well they will recover both physically and psychologically. 
 4.  Ask about previous episodes of disease (a relapsing course and the presence of sensory 
symptoms and proximal weakness suggest chronic infl ammatory demyelinating poly-
neuropathy – CIDP). 
 5.  Ask about evidence of autonomic neuropathy, such as postural hypotension, labile 
blood pressure, diffi  cult-to-control arrhythmias and, rarely, sphincter dysfunction (see 
 Table 16.42 ,  p. 490 ). 
 6.  Ask about neuropathic pain. 
 7.  Enquire about the social history, recurrent falls, family support, etc. 
 The examination 
 1.  Predominantly, distal muscle weakness without atrophy is present, although 25% 
have more proximal than distal weakness. Th e upper limbs may be more aff ected 
than the lower limbs. Tendon refl exes are reduced or absent concomitant with the 
degree of weakness. Muscle tenderness is common (one-third of cases). 
 
 
344
Examination Medicine
 2.  Signs of autonomic neuropathy (severe postural changes in blood pressure and cardiac 
arrhythmias) must be looked for. 
 3.  Sensory loss is usually minimal, but if present it aff ects the posterior columns (vibration 
and proprioception) more than the spinothalamic tracts. 
 4.  Always measure forced expiratory time. 
 5.  Examine for ophthalmoplegia, as its presence suggests the uncommon Miller Fisher 
variant (ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and arefl exia). 
 6.  Look for pressure sores and signs of deep venous thrombosis in bed-bound patients. 
 Investigations 
 Guillain–Barré syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. Helpful tests include the following:
 1.  immune stimulus – identify the immune stimulus by the Monospot test, cold 
agglutinins, tests for cytomegalovirus, HIV or  Campylobacter 
 2.  cerebrospinal fl uid examination – look for a raised protein level and the relative 
lack of white blood cells in 90% of cases; 10% have 10–50 mononuclear cells / mL 
 3.  respiratory function tests (FEV 1 , FVC) – assess the progressive involvement of respira-
tory muscles; the patient can progress rapidly (even over hours) to respiratory failure 
requiring intubation and should be admitted to hospital, even if only mildly aff ected 
 4.  nerve conduction and  electromyogram studies – many nerves may have to be studied 
to fi nd abnormalities because this disease is patchy, but abnormalities include slowed 
motor conduction, conduction blocks, increased distal motor latencies, reduced sensory 
action potentials and increased F wave latencies. EMG evidence of denervation takes 10 
days to 3 weeks to appear and may indicate axonal involvement with a worse prognosis 
 5.  antiganglioside antibodies – anti-GM1 and anti-GD3 (not sensitive) and anti-GQ1b 
antibodies are found in 90% of the Miller Fisher variant cases. 
 Differential diagnosis 
 Infections such as glandular fever, acute viral hepatitis,  Mycoplasma pneumonia,  Campy-
lobacter jejuni and HIV can cause Guillain–Barré syndrome. Post-infl uenza vaccine 
disease is rare. Th e diff erential diagnosis of acute ascending motor paralysis includes 
diphtheria, polio, polyarteritis nodosa, acute intermittent porphyria, tick or snake bites 
and rhabdomyolysis, arsenic poisoning and botulism. Critical illness myopathy or poly-
neuropathy might be considered in some patients. Remember that diphtheria, botulism 
and myasthenia gravis usually begin with bulbar symptoms. 
 Th e diff erential diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy includes diabetes mellitus, alcohol-
ism, acute intermittent porphyria and amyloidosis.
 1.  Chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy may begin in a similar way 
to Guillain–Barré but progress or relapse more than 2 months after it begins. Other 
patients with CIDP have more slowly developing motor and, to a lesser extent, sensory 
changes in proximal and distal muscles. Sensory changes including pain are more 
common in CIDP. 
 2.  Diabetes and connective tissue disease are important diff erential diagnoses. 
 Treatment 
 Prognosis is good – most patients make a complete recovery over time (up to a year), 
but 2% die (usually of respiratory complications, pulmonary emboli or cardiac arrhythmias) 
and 10% have a major residual defi cit. If the defi cit does not diminish within 3 weeks 
or the patient has autonomic neuropathy, a poorer prognosis is more likely.
 1.  Physiotherapy is used to prevent contractures. Respiratory support in an ICU is 
essential if the vital capacity is less than 1 litre.

12 • The neurological long case
 2.  Immunosuppression, intravenous gammaglobulin and plasma exchange have all been 
shown to be eff ective treatment. 
 3.  Plasmapheresis or intravenous gamma globulin shortens the time to recovery from 
respiratory paralysis and hastens the return of mobility. Th ey are equally eff ective and 
combined treatment off ers no additional benefi t. Treatment should be begun as soon 
as possible. Rapid improvement is much more likely if treatment is begun within 2 
weeks of the fi rst symptoms. Relapses may occur and are more common after intravenous 
gamma globulin than after plasmapheresis. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  Discuss the differential diagnosis of  this patient ’ s weakness. 
 2.  How would you investigate  this patient? 
 3.  How do you see  this patient progressing in the short, medium and long term? 
 Syncope, seizures and ‘funny turns’ 
 Patients presenting with a ‘funny turn’ can pose a diffi  cult diagnostic problem as there 
are many possible explanations. Th e problem may be neurological, cardiac, endocrinological 
or psychiatric. A careful history and physical examination should enable the candidate 
to produce a sensible diff erential diagnosis and management plan. Treatment is usually 
fairly straightforward once the diagnosis is made. 
 The history 
 1.  Presyncope refers to a sense of impending loss of consciousness, manifest as faintness 
or light-headedness, and is often associated with sweating, nausea, anxiety and visual 
dimming. Th ese can be considered haemodynamic causes of dizziness ( Box 12.1 ).
 a.  Causes of this condition can include cardiac arrhythmias, postural hypotension, 
cough syncope and micturition syncope. 
 Box 12.1   Haemodynamic dizziness 
 1.  Cardiac
 •  Aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
 •  Arrhythmia – bradycardia or tachycardia 
 2.  Autonomic
 •  Vasovagal 
 •  Autonomic neuropathy, e.g. diabetes mellitus 
 •  Multisystem atrophy, e.g. associated with Parkinson ’ s disease 
 3.  Drugs
 •  Antihypertensives including vasodilators for prostatism 
 •  Antipsychotics 
 4.  Hypovolaemia
 •  Haemorrhage 
 •  Dehydration 
 •  Addisonian crisis 
 5.  Cerebrovascular
 •  Vertebrobasilar insufﬁ ciency (very rare) 
 
 
346
Examination Medicine
 b.  Vasovagal syncope or presyncope can often be diagnosed clinically if the history 
is typical: an episode begins with clamminess, sweating and nausea and often 
occurs in a crowded room or after something upsetting has happened. 
 2.  Epilepsy needs to be considered in the diff erential diagnosis. Th e diagnosis depends 
greatly on the characteristics of the seizures ( Tables 12.4 and  12.5 ):
 a.  Focal epilepsy is usually accompanied by an aura or a warning (e.g. fl ashing lights, 
twitching of the face or a limb, unilateral tingling or numbness, buzzing noises 
or humming). 
 b.  Generalised epilepsy may be associated with myoclonic jerks (juvenile myoclonic 
epilepsy), but frequently occurs with sudden loss of consciousness without warning. 
 c.  Eyewitness accounts are crucial in making a diagnosis. Eyewitnesses are likely to 
fi nd a seizure more frightening than a syncopal episode. Idiopathic generalised 
epilepsy is frequently symmetrical with tonic (stiff ening) and then clonic (brief 
jerking movements) phases, whereas partial seizures with secondary generalisation 
may be associated with asymmetric posturing initially. 
 d.  Eyewitnesses may have had the presence of mind to fi lm the episode on their 
phones and review of these pictures can be very helpful. 
 e.  If epilepsy has been diagnosed or is suspected, ask the patient how this has been 
discussed and what restrictions have been placed on his or her activities. How 
has the diagnosis aff ected him or her at home, at work and emotionally? 
 f.  Remember that seizure activity may accompany cerebral hypoxia of any cause (e.g. 
Stokes–Adams attacks). A long period of drowsiness often follows a major seizure. 
 Table 12.4   Classiﬁ cation of epileptic seizures a 
 1.  Partial seizures – the abnormal electrical discharge may remain localised or spread to other parts of 
the cortex:
 a.  Simple partial seizures do not affect consciousness. Examples may include isolated ‘auras’ of 
smells or  déjà vu (a feeling that new events or people are familiar), or  jamais vu (a feeling that 
known events or people are unfamiliar), or pure motor or sensory seizures. 
 b.  Complex partial seizures involve altered consciousness when the seizure spreads to involve one or 
both temporal lobes. Patients may stare and not respond, and may posture, turn their head or 
perform automatic motor tasks. 
 c.  Secondarily generalised seizures cause convulsions and occur when a partial seizure spreads to 
involve both hemispheres diffusely. These convulsions involve impaired awareness followed by 
generalised muscle contractions (tonic movements) and then rhythmical contraction and relaxation 
of muscles (clonic movements). They may be hard to distinguish from primary generalised 
seizures, but sometimes focal features such as asymmetric posturing or the report of a preceding 
aura help to make the diagnosis. 
 d.  Jacksonian seizures are simple motor seizures characterised by rhythmical contraction of a group of 
muscles (typically of the ﬁ ngers) that spread to the arm and then the ipsilateral side of the face. 
 e.  Partial seizures may be preceded by an aura, particularly if the seizure activity begins in the 
temporal lobe. Patients may describe a feeling of  déjà vu , of dread, or of abdominal pain that 
spreads to the chest. This aura is a form of partial seizure, of which the patient is aware. 
 2.  Generalised seizures – involve both hemispheres from the start:
 a.  Primary generalised tonic and clonic seizures (GTCS) are convulsions that may occur with no 
warning. Tongue biting and incontinence are common, and a feeling of confusion and tiredness is 
common afterwards. 
 b.  Absence seizures are generalised seizures that cause momentary loss of consciousness. They 
mostly happen in children. Up to 200 episodes a day may occur. 
 c.  Myoclonic seizures are very brief jerky movements that occur without warning, often when the 
patient is tired or in the morning. They are associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). 
 a Remember that epilepsy is the condition of having seizures and a seizure is the event itself.

12 • The neurological long case
 3.  Vertigo is the illusion of movement of the self or the environment. Th e sensation 
is often rotational. Often nausea, vomiting, imbalance and anxiety are associated.
 a.  Causes of this condition include vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, benign par-
oxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière ’ s disease, stroke and MS. Cerebellar 
stroke characteristically causes severe associated nausea and vomiting, and is of 
sudden onset. 
 b.  Ask whether the vertigo is related to the position of the head (e.g. especially occurs 
when the patient turns over in bed or looks up or down). Th is symptom suggests 
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. If vertigo is persistent or occurs at rest, the 
diagnosis  is not BPPV . 
 4.  Unsteadiness of gait may be secondary to a number of disorders of the peripheral 
or central nervous system. Cerebellar, sensory, extrapyramidal and myopathic diseases 
can all present in this way. Causes may include a range of pathologies from drug 
side-eff ects and stroke to neoplasms and degenerative disease. 
 5.  Hypoglycaemia is an important, albeit rare, cause of ‘funny turns’ and must always 
be considered in the diff erential diagnosis. It is associated with hunger, sweating, 
tremor and tachycardia (owing to catecholamine release), as well as neurological 
dysfunction. Causes of hypoglycaemia include: too much insulin or oral hypoglycaemic 
agent and not enough food; reactive or postprandial, usually among patients with 
gastric surgery; or fasting (especially among patients with hypopituitarism, adrenal 
insuffi  ciency, cirrhosis, alcoholism or rarely an insulinoma). 
 6.  Th ere are a number of cardiac causes of ‘funny turns’ or syncope (see  Table 12.5 ):
 a.  A dizzy feeling related to standing up and without any component of true vertigo 
suggests postural hypotension. Th is can be a complication of antihypertensive 
treatment, especially with vasodilating drugs, and occasionally occurs in patients 
with single-chamber ventricular pacemakers (pacemaker syndrome). 
 b.  Orthostatic hypotension is common in the elderly and in patients with autonomic 
neuropathy (e.g. secondary to diabetes mellitus). 
 c.  Episodes of complete heart block may complicate ischaemic heart disease or be 
caused by degenerative disease of the conducting system. Th ese patients describe 
syncope occurring without warning. Unless they have been injured by the fall, 
they feel normal again immediately. 
 d.  Ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias may cause dizziness or syncope, 
possibly associated with palpitations. Ventricular arrhythmias are more likely in

patients with known structural heart disease (e.g. previous infarction). Remember 
that antiarrhythmic drugs can cause bradycardia and are associated in some cases 
with dangerous proarrhythmic eff ects. 
 e.  Patients with severe aortic stenosis may present with exertional syncope, which 
may be associated with ischaemic-like chest pain. 
 7.  Other conditions that need to be considered include episodes of hyperventilation 
or panic attacks. Patients who sigh often because of anxiety are rarely aware of any 
abnormality of their breathing. Th eir dizziness is often accompanied by a sensation 
of swaying. 
 Transient global amnesia sometimes presents as a ‘funny turn’ involving temporary 
disorientation and loss of memory without other focal neurology. Its hallmark is the 
sudden onset of repetitive questioning of family and friends about what is happening. 
 8.  Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES – no longer called pseudoseizures or 
hysterical seizures) need to be distinguished from epilepsy as a cause of apparent 
syncope. Th ey do not respond to anticonvulsant treatment. Unlike the seizures of 
epilepsy, they feature:
 •  forced eye closure 
 •  prolonged episodes ( > 5 minutes) 
 •  occurrence particularly when there is an audience (often the crowded waiting 
room) 
 •  unusual motor events – opisthotonus (back arching), pelvic thrusting, side-to-side 
movements, changes in the plane of movement (nodding then shaking of the 
head) 
 •  a normal EEG during the event. 
 Th e patient may have been given this diagnosis. Investigations may have included 
prolonged video and EEG recording. Th is diagnosis is an important one as intubation 
and aggressive benzodiazepine therapy are associated with substantial morbidity. 
 9.  Ask for a list of all the drugs the patient has been taking ( Tables 12.6 and  12.7 ). 
Enquire about medications that increase the risk of vascular episodes, including oral 
contraceptives and some peripheral vasodilator drugs that can lower blood pressure. 
Also, ask specifi cally about sedatives, hypoglycaemic agents, anticonvulsants and 
drugs aff ecting cardiac conduction. Try to fi nd out whether adherence has been a 
problem. Have anticonvulsant blood levels been monitored? 
 Table 12.6   Choice of anticonvulsant 
Remember, treatment is generally not indicated for a ﬁ rst seizure without a CNS lesion. Although there is 
evidence to suggest a preference for certain ﬁ rst-line agents for certain seizure disorders, the effect sizes 
are quite small, so if other factors such as dosing frequency, side effects and interactions become issues, 
you could consider commencing with another agent.

12 • The neurological long case
 10.  Both undiagnosed and diagnosed syncopal episodes can have legal and other implica-
tions. Ask how the condition has aff ected the patient ’ s life and work:
 •  Has driving or the operating of machinery been forbidden? 
 •  If so, for how long? 
 •  When might these be allowed again? 
 •  How does he or she manage work, shopping, getting to appointments? 
 •  Has this led to mood changes? 
 •  How does the family cope? 
 THE EXAMINATION 
 A complete examination of the neurological and cardiovascular systems is essential, but 
must be guided by the symptoms.
 1.  Check all the pulses. Decide whether atrial fi brillation is present. Test the blood 
pressure lying and standing for postural hypotension. Listen for murmurs (e.g. as a 
result of aortic stenosis, infective endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease or a prosthetic 
valve). Examine for peripheral vascular disease. Note the presence of an electronic 
pacemaker. 
 2.  Th e fundi should be carefully examined for evidence of emboli, hypertensive changes, 
diabetic changes and ischaemic retinopathy. Test the visual fi elds (e.g. for homonymous 
hemianopia in stroke). 
 3.  If indicated, perform the Hallpike test for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. If 
vertigo is a symptom, examine eye movements carefully for nystagmus and skew 
deviation. Perform a head impulse test for vestibular hypofunction. Examine for limb 
and gait ataxia and sensation in the head and limbs. 
 4.  Palpate over the temporal areas for the tenderness of giant cell arteritis. 
 Investigations 
 1.  An ECG should be recorded (for evidence of ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia or 
heart block). Look for a long or short QT interval. Patients in sinus rhythm, but 
with bifascicular or trifascicular block, may be having episodes of complete heart 
block. Intermittent episodes that may be a result of cardiac arrhythmias (brady- or 
tachycardias) can be investigated with Holter monitor recordings. When episodes are 
infrequent but severe, an implanted cardiac ‘loop’ recorder can be used. Th ese small 
subcutaneous devices will record loops of ECG. Th ey can be programmed to record 
heart rate above or below a certain number and will store the ECG from the preceding 
few minutes if activated by the patient with a magnet. 
 Suspected epilepsy is investigated with an MRI scan and EEG. A fi rst seizure must 
be investigated to exclude cerebral tumours, vascular malformations and strokes.

Examination Medicine
 2.  Normal results from these tests  do not exclude epilepsy and a slightly abnormal EEG 
does not make the diagnosis of epilepsy in someone with atypical symptoms. Video 
and EEG monitoring can be required to make the diagnosis and can be used where 
patients have not responded to two antiepileptic drugs to help clarify the diagnosis 
and to exclude pseudoseizures. 
 In patients with a suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA – transient focal 
neurological symptoms are essential to this diagnosis), it is worthwhile ordering an 
FBC, ESR (elevated in temporal arteritis and in connective tissue disease), fasting 
plasma glucose (for evidence of diabetes or hypoglycaemia), cholesterol (for hyper-
cholesterolaemia), cortisol (if hypotensive) and urinalysis (for evidence of renovascular 
disease). 
 3.  Possible TIAs and strokes require investigation with at least a CT scan of the brain 
and often an MRI as well (see  p. 352 ). Urgent carotid Doppler scans are indicated 
for symptoms that could be attributed to brain supplied by the anterior circulation. 
 Management 
 Treatment will depend on the fi nal diagnosis and can include:
 1.  withdrawal of drugs 
 2.  canalith-repositioning manoeuvres – can be very helpful for people with benign 
paroxysmal positional vertigo 
 3.  pacemaker or defi brillator insertion – it is usually unwise to implant these devices 
without an established diagnosis 
 4.  use of anticonvulsants ( Table 12.8 ) 
 5.  for patients with vasovagal syncope – reassurance and explanation and advice about 
recognising the triggers and symptoms that may precede an episode may be all that 
is required. 
 A diagnosis of epilepsy will have serious consequences for the patient and his or her 
work, ability to drive, play sport, etc. Much explanation and discussion will be required 
about the condition and what treatment involves as far as eff ectiveness and side-eff ects 
are concerned. Find out from the patient whether these matters have been discussed.
 
 Table 12.8   Commonly used anticonvulsants and their side-effects 
In general, any of these can be used to treat partial epilepsies but some (carbamazepine, gabapentin, 
phenytoin and pregabalin) can make generalised epilepsy worse. The newer drugs are not especially more 
effective than older ones, but may have fewer side-effects. Combinations of drugs are used when one fails.

12 • The neurological long case
 Transient ischaemic attack and stroke 
 Patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic episodes are common in the 
long-case exam. Cerebrovascular disease may sometimes be the main problem. Note 
that the correct terminology is a ‘stroke’ and not ‘cerebrovascular accident’. 
 The history 
 Th e patient who has had a stroke or TIA is likely to know the diagnosis, but there may 
still be a diff erential diagnosis. It may be possible from the history to establish whether 
cerebrovascular disease and, in particular, TIAs explain the symptoms convincingly. 
Misdiagnosis of TIA is also common, so confi rmation of the symptoms is essential. 
 TIAs occur suddenly; there is focal neurological loss that is maximal at onset and 
does not spread or intensify. By defi nition, the symptoms must resolve within 24 hours, 
although after an hour imaging changes are usually present on MRI. If so, it is termed 
a stroke. As such, true TIAs usually last from minutes to an hour. Specifi c enquiry 
should be made about unilateral weakness or clumsiness, diffi  culty in understanding or 
expressing spoken language, altered sensation unilaterally, and partial or complete loss 
of vision in one eye or bilateral blindness. Ten per cent of TIA patients have a completed 
stroke within 90 days, and 40% of strokes are preceded by TIAs. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How would you discuss the need and possible problems associated with an implanted 
deﬁ brillator with  this patient? 
 2.  How would you manage  this patient ’ s vertigo? 
 3.  Would you recommend any changes to  this patient ’ s antiepileptic treatment? 
 4.  Are you going to recommend  this patient continue driving? 
 HINT 
 Remember the criteria for recommending admission to hospital after a TIA (a score of 
3 or more is an indication for admission):
 1.  Age  > 60  = 1 point 
 2.  BP  > 140 / 90 mmHg  = 1 point 
 3.  Focal weakness during episode  = 2 points 
 4.  Speech impaired, no weakness  = 1 point 
 5.  > 60 min of symptoms  = 2 points 
 6.  10–59 min of symptoms  = 1 point 
 7.  Diabetic patient  = 1 point 
 Slurred speech is less helpful as a symptom in a possible TIA and faintness, confusion, 
simultaneous bilateral weakness and spinning sensations are not localising symptoms. 
If these are the main symptoms, it suggests that the diagnosis is not a TIA.
 1.  Ask whether the neurological defi cits have lasted for longer than 24 hours. Th is is 
consistent with the syndrome of a completed stroke. 
 
 
352
Examination Medicine
 2.  Th e absence of focal symptoms in a patient with severe headache and vomiting 
suggests subarachnoid haemorrhage. Vomiting and focal symptoms may occur with 
intracerebral haemorrhage, but headache is present in less than 50% of these patients. 
 3.  In ischaemic stroke, the symptoms typically begin abruptly, often during sleep, and 
are not usually associated with headache or vomiting. 
 4.  Enquire about risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (in particular hypertension 
(the most important), smoking, diabetes, family history and hyperlipidaemia). 
 5.  Neck pain or previous neck manipulation may indicate arterial dissection. 
 6.  Symptoms of connective tissue disease or thrombotic episodes may be relevant. 
 7.  Vasculitis can be an occasional cause of stroke. 
 8.  What residual defi cit has the patient suff ered? 
 9.  How has this aff ected the patient ’ s work, sport, his or her ability to look after him 
or herself, mood and thoughts about the future? 
 10.  What investigations is the patient aware of? 
 11.  Was thrombolysis attempted? 
 12.  What treatment is being given now – antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, antihyper-
tensives, cholesterol-lowering drugs? 
 HINT 
 Haemorrhagic stroke (17% of strokes) cannot be differentiated from ischaemic stroke 
clinically, although coma, seizures, vomiting, headache, meningism and a raised diastolic 
blood pressure are suggestive of haemorrhage. 
 The examination 
 1.  Perform an appropriate neurological examination to establish the defi cit and its eff ect 
on function (e.g. walking, writing, etc.). Be guided by the history. 
 2.  Carotid bruits should be listened for, but their absence does not exclude tight carotid 
stenosis. Unfortunately, even if a bruit is present, this does not necessarily indicate 
tight common or internal carotid artery stenosis, because external carotid artery 
stenosis can also cause a bruit. 
 3.  Examine the rest of the cardiovascular system for evidence of hypertension, atrial 
fi brillation, heart failure or a mechanical valve. 
 Investigations 
 1.  A CT or MRI  ± MRA scan of the head ( Figs 12.3 and  12.4 ) should be performed 
for all patients with a TIA or stroke, as 5% of apparent TIAs are caused by structural 
lesions. A CT scan is also worth performing in patients with established stroke to 
exclude haemorrhage, as this alters management. CT perfusion imaging can be used 
to guide thrombolysis or endovascular clot retrieval. It would be useful to know what 
the patient received as it will give you an indication of the perceived severity of the 
stroke at the time relative to the patient ’ s baseline function. 
 HINT 
 A non-contrast CT scan will easily exclude a haemorrhagic stroke. It may appear normal 
early (days) after an acute ischaemic stroke. 
 
 
353
12 • The neurological long case
 2.  A carotid ultrasound should be performed in patients who have carotid territory 
TIAs / stroke. Suggestive features of a carotid artery TIA / stroke include monocular 
visual loss, unilateral sensory disturbances or weakness, or aphasia. Vertebrobasilar TIAs, 
on the other hand, may cause bilateral visual loss, weakness or sensory disturbance, and 
crossed sensory and motor loss. If  > 70% stenosis of the origin of the internal carotid 
artery on the symptomatic side is found, carotid angiography should be considered with 
a view to endarterectomy or angioplasty, which is of value in otherwise-fi t patients. 
 3.  A transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) and if indicated a bubble study should 
be considered. Order a TOE in any stroke patient with abnormalities on examination 
of the heart or with abnormalities on the ECG (or chest X-ray). It is also recommended 
when no other cause has been found for the episode as it may reveal a patent foramen 
ovale (PFO), a known cause of paradoxical embolism, in up to 30% of people. 
Catheter-based PFO closure is superior to medical therapy. 
 4.  Patients with atrial fi brillation should have their thyroid function checked and an echocar-
diogram performed to look at left ventricular size – a predictor of risk of embolic events. 
Rarely, an intracardiac mass (usually a left atrial myxoma) is discovered. It is a rare cause 
of stroke and is often associated with systemic symptoms. Resection is usually possible.

 5.  In relatively young patients with a TIA / stroke ( < 50 years of age), careful attention 
to the possibility of connective tissue disease is worthwhile. Check for antinuclear 
antibody, anticardiolipin antibody (because of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome) 
and for thrombophilia.

 Causes of ischaemic stroke:
 1.  Embolus from the heart – 20% 
 2.  Large artery disease – 20% 
 3.  Subcortical (lacunar) – 25% 
 4.  Cryptogenic – 30% 
 5.  Vasculitis, genetic, venous sinus thrombosis – 5% 
 Treatment 
 Th is will depend on the diagnosis in the particular case. If a TIA is likely, you should 
plan to discuss vascular risk factor treatments, antiplatelet therapy and the role of carotid 
endarterectomy. Th e diagnosis is never TIA if neurology persists, even if improving.
 1.  Acute stroke can be treated with thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen 
activator (rtPA) up to 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms, though the benefi t is 
 
 
355
12 • The neurological long case
larger the earlier the drug is given after symptom onset. If onset of symptoms (e.g. 
on waking up) is unclear then thrombolysis should not be given. It is best practice 
for this to be administered by someone experienced in the management of stroke. 
Clot retrieval is increasingly available for these patients. It can be performed after 
thrombolytic treatment. It can be dramatically eff ective and the window for successful 
treatment is extending. A CT scan must be performed to exclude haemorrhagic 
stroke. 
 2.  Th ere is a direct relationship between high blood pressure, smoking and cholesterol 
level and an increased risk of ischaemic stroke as well as coronary artery disease. 
Th erefore, management of risk factors by conservative means or with drugs 
is essential. 
 3.  Th e blood pressure is often elevated after an acute ischaemic stroke – do  not lower 
unless malignant hypertension or thrombolysis is planned. 
 4.  Antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of stroke in patients prone to TIAs. Low-dose 
aspirin (between 75 and 100 mg per day) is a reasonable regimen to use. Clopidogrel 
is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) inhibitor and a slightly more eff ective alterna-
tive to aspirin. It is generally used for people intolerant of aspirin, or sometimes 
for those who have recurrent events while taking aspirin. Recurrence of symptoms 
when patients are already taking aspirin is an indication for the combination of 
aspirin and dipyridamole or a change to clopidogrel. Aspirin and clopidogrel in 
combination have not been shown to be more eff ective than aspirin alone, mainly 
because of an increased risk of serious bleeding. At least 2 years of treatment is 
necessary after a TIA, but most would recommend the lifelong use of antiplatelet 
agents. 
 In those with atrial fi brillation (AF) not caused by rheumatic heart disease, aspirin 
reduces the risk of a recurrent event by one-fi fth and direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) 
reduce it by one-half, similar in effi  cacy to warfarin. Most cardiologists and neurologists 
would now recommend a DOAC to any patient in AF who has had a defi nite or 
even a possible embolic event and in patients with an elevated (i.e. one point or 
more) CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (see  p. 95 ). Th e risk of major haemorrhage with apixaban 
use is the lowest of all the DOACs, and the risk with DOACs as a group is less than 
with warfarin. If there are contraindications to DOACs (due to renal dysfunction or 
medication interaction), it would probably be appropriate to use warfarin rather than 
an empirical low-dose DOAC. In those who have rheumatic heart disease, mechanical 
prosthetic heart valves or other cardiac sources of emboli, long-term anticoagulation 
with warfarin is strongly recommended. 
 5.  If the patient is taking warfarin, fi nd out about problems managing the dose and 
INR tests. Does the patient know what recent INR results have been? How often is 
it tested? 
 6.  Carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty and stenting is worth considering in patients 
with a TIA / small stroke in the carotid territory within the preceding 6 months who 
have documented severe ( > 70%) stenosis of the origin of the internal carotid artery 
on the symptomatic side. It is most benefi cial if performed early after TIA, though 
after stroke it can be delayed if there is a risk of haemorrhage. Th ese patients have a 
25% risk of having a completed stroke in the following 2 years. Surgery in such cases 
is defi nitely superior to medical therapy. A decision to operate should be based on 
the availability of surgical expertise and the complication (stroke) rate of a particular 
surgical unit. 
 Admission to an acute stroke unit improves outcome and 1-year mortality. Th ese 
units provide expertise in care of the patient ’ s airway, assessment of swallowing, use of

feeding tubes and prevention of pressure sores and they provide access to rehabilitation 
units. Th ey can also provide occupational therapists to make home visits and appropriate 
equipment to ensure a patient has the best chance of returning home. Th ese are important 
issues to assess in discussion of a stroke patient ’ s treatment. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What would you tell  this patient about his or her risk of stroke over the next few 
years? 
 2.  Would you recommend closure of  this patient ’ s patent foramen ovale? 
 3.  Has  this patient had the best possible rehabilitation and care? 
 4.  What anticoagulant or antiplatelet regimen should this patient be on?

sweats; this is more common in medical or paramedical personnel. 
 The examination 
 1.  Look at the temperature chart, if available, to see whether the fever pattern is 
characteristic. Th e temperature tends to fall to normal each day in pyogenic infections, 
TB and lymphoma, whereas in malaria the temperature can return to normal for 
days before rising again.

 2.  Inspect the patient: note whether he or she appears ill or not, whether there is 
cachexia (suggesting a chronic disease process) and any skin rash, e.g.:
 •  erythema multiforme 
 •  erythema nodosum 
 •  adult Still ’ s disease (salmon-pink macular rash). 
 3.  Pick up the hands and look for stigmata of infective endocarditis or any vasculitic 
changes, and for fi nger clubbing. 
 4.  Inspect the arms for injection sites (intravenous drug abuse). 
 5.  Palpate for epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenopathy (e.g. lymphoma, solid tumour 
spread, focal infections). 
 6.  Examine the eyes for iritis or conjunctivitis (e.g. connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis) 
or jaundice (e.g. cholangitis, liver abscess). Look in the fundi for choroidal tubercles 
(miliary TB), Roth ’ s spots (infective endocarditis), retinal haemorrhages or infi ltrates 
(e.g. leukaemia). Note any facial rash (e.g. SLE). Feel the temporal arteries (temporal 
arteritis). 
 7.  Examine the mouth for ulcers and gum disease and the teeth and tonsils for infection. 
Feel the parotids for parotitis and the sinuses for sinusitis. 
 8.  Palpate the cervical lymph nodes. 
 9.  Examine for thyroid enlargement and tenderness (subacute thyroiditis). 
 10.  Examine the chest. Palpate for bony tenderness over the sternum and shoulders. 
 11.  Examine the respiratory system (e.g. for signs of TB, abscess, empyema, carcinoma) 
and the heart for murmurs (e.g. infective endocarditis, atrial myxoma) or prosthetic 
heart sounds or rubs (e.g. pericarditis). 
 12.  Examine the abdomen.
 a.  Inspect for skin rash (e.g. the rose-coloured spots of typhoid, an uncommon long 
case). 
 b.  Palpate for:
 i.  tenderness (e.g. abscess) 
 ii.  hepatomegaly (e.g. granulomatous hepatitis, hepatoma, cirrhosis, metastatic 
deposits) 
 iii.  splenomegaly (e.g. haemopoietic malignancy, infective endocarditis, malaria) 
 iv.  renal enlargement (e.g. obstruction, renal cell carcinoma). 
 13.  Feel the testes for enlargement (e.g. seminoma, TB). Feel for inguinal adenopathy. 
Always ask for the results of the rectal examination (e.g. prostatic abscess, rectal 
cancer, Crohn ’ s disease) and pelvic examination (pelvic pus). Look at the penis and 
scrotum for a discharge or rash. 
 14.  Examine the nervous system for signs of:
 a.  meningism (chronic meningitis) 
 b.  focal neurological signs (e.g. brain abscess, mononeuritis multiplex in polyarteritis 
nodosa). 
 15.  Check the results of the urine analysis. 
 Investigations 
 1.  Determine how many blood cultures have been obtained and the results.
 a.  Ask to review the:
 i.  blood count and smear (e.g. for neutropenia, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes) 
 ii.  liver function tests 
 iii.  electrolytes and creatinine. 
 b.  Look at the chest X-ray. 
 c.  Rule out urinary tract disease if suspected. 
 
 
361
13 • Other important long cases
 2.  Selected serological tests may be helpful depending on the clinical setting (e.g. fungal, 
HIV, Q fever). An autoimmune screen – antinuclear antibody (ANA), erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), an electrophoretogram (EPG) 
and complement levels – should be assessed if a connective tissue disease is suspected. 
However, remember that malignancy and infection can also cause an increase in 
acute-phase reactants and a low-titre ANA. Check the purifi ed protein derivative 
(PPD) for TB exposure. 
 3.  If abdominal disease is suspected or other tests have not provided a clue, obtain a 
CT scan. 
 4.  Biopsy of involved tissue (e.g. bone marrow, liver, lymph node, skin, muscle) may 
lead to a defi nitive diagnosis. Th e clinical setting determines what should be biopsied. 
 5.  Exploratory laparotomy when all other tests are negative and in the absence of any 
evidence of abdominal disease is usually unproductive. 
 Treatment 
 Th erapy directed at the underlying disease should be the goal of assessment. Th erapeutic 
trials in the absence of a diagnosis (e.g. antibiotics, antituberculosis therapy, NSAIDs, 
steroids) may result in resistant bacterial infection or drug toxicity and may make accurate 
diagnosis diffi  cult. If the patient is thought to have a fever caused by a drug – a  drug 
fever – it may be worth stopping the drug or using an alternative one. A possible drug 
fever makes trialling a change of drug worthwhile. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  When would you decide to start  this patient on antibiotics? 
 2.  Can you give us a detailed account of  this patient ’ s occupational exposure to possible 
infection? 
 HIV / AIDS 
 Patients with human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) infection or the acquired immunode-
fi ciency syndrome (AIDS) have become increasingly available for long-case examinations. 
Th is is now often a chronic disease and patients are getting older and likely to have 
problems such as ischaemic heart disease. Remember that the diagnosis of AIDS can be 
made when someone infected with HIV has a CD4  +  cell count of  < 200 cells /  μ L or an 
HIV-associated disease. Th ese patients present numerous diagnostic and management 
problems. Th e candidate will be expected to display a logical approach to the case and, 
of course, show a sympathetic attitude to the patient with this chronic disease. Th ere 
needs to be a strong emphasis in the discussion on the psychological and social eff ects of 
the illness. Public health implications may also have to be addressed. Candidates should 
have an approach to pretest counselling for patients being tested for HIV. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask about the presenting symptoms. As usual for long cases, the candidate must 
fi nd out what symptoms or complications are currently aff ecting the patient. Th ese 
must be assessed in the context of possible longstanding disease aff ecting many 
systems of the body. 
 
 
362
Examination Medicine
 2.  Enquire when the virus was acquired. Th is is especially important in helping predict 
the likely level of immunosuppression. Not all patients are prepared to discuss this. 
Insistent questioning by candidates is not a good idea. Th ere have been complaints 
from long-case patients that this has been handled insensitively.
 a.  Find out about symptoms of a possible seroconversion illness in the past 
( Table 13.3 ). Approximately 50% of people have a seroconversion illness. It occurs 
3–6 weeks after infection and often resembles glandular fever. Remember that, 
without treatment, the development of AIDS takes roughly 7–10 years from the 
time of seroconversion. Th e occurrence of a seroconversion illness does not seem 
to be associated with a worse prognosis. 
 b.  Note from the history any of the conditions likely to occur during the period of 
mild-to-moderate immunosuppression that precedes the development of AIDS 
and those related to severe immunosuppression that defi ne the development of 
AIDS (see  Table 13.4 ). 
 3.  Ask about the mode of acquisition of infection. Co-morbidity diff ers between 
subgroups, so specifi c questions about risk factors are essential. For example, co-
infections with syphilis or papilloma viruses and Kaposi ’ s sarcoma is often found in 
the homosexual male subgroup, whereas hepatitis B and C infection, endocarditis, 
heroin nephropathy and other disorders related to drug abuse may complicate the 
disease in the intravenous-drug-using group. Many haemophilia A patients acquired 
HIV from pooled blood products. 
 4.  Ask about sexual contacts. Contact tracing must be mentioned and the possibility 
of infection of sexual partners without their knowledge addressed. Ask the patient 
whether family and friends are aware of the diagnosis. Th eir attitude to this chronic 
illness may aff ect the patient ’ s ability to cope. 
 Table 13.3   Features of the seroconversion illness 
A seroconversion illness occurs in more than 50% of cases. There is usually some combination of the 
following symptoms:
 • 
 fever 
 • 
 lymphadenopathy 
 • 
 maculopapular rash 
 • 
 arthralgia 
 •

 5.  Ask about general constitutional symptoms. Symptoms of fever, lethargy and weight 
loss may indicate the AIDS-related complex or suggest an underlying opportunistic 
infection or malignancy. 
 6.  Enquire about specifi c symptoms:
 a.  respiratory – cough, dyspnoea, sputum; these may result from  P. jirovecii pneumonia, 
lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, TB, bacterial pneumonia or fungal pneumonia 
 b.  gastrointestinal – diarrhoea or weight loss as a result of cryptosporidiosis, micro-
sporidiosis, mycobacterial infection or CMV colitis; odynophagia as a result of 
oesophageal candidiasis, herpes simplex virus (HSV) or CMV ulceration; vomiting 
and abdominal pain due to biliary tract disease; drug side-eff ects (e.g. didanosine-
induced pancreatitis) – diarrhoea is usual when patients are treated with protease 
inhibitors 
 c.  neurological – meningism caused by cryptococcal meningitis; focal neurological 
symptoms or seizures as a result of space-occupying lesions, toxoplasmosis or 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma; cognitive decline as a result of HIV dementia or multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy; peripheral nervous system disease due to peripheral neu-
ropathy, CMV radiculopathy or myopathy; manifestations of neurosyphilis 
 d.  renal – nephrotic syndrome from HIV-associated nephropathy; renal failure due 
to sepsis or drug side-eff ects 
 e.  ocular – deteriorating vision, which usually suggests advanced CMV retinitis 
 f.  dermatological – rashes may be caused by drug reactions, viral infection (e.g. 
herpes zoster virus (HZV) or HSV) or fungal infection; itch may be caused by 
scabies or drug reaction; nodules can be caused by Kaposi ’ s sarcoma ( Fig. 13.1 ) 
or bacillary angiomatosis; seborrhoeic dermatitis and psoriasis occur commonly 
 g.  mouth – ulcers (aphthous or viral) ( Figs 13.2 and  13.3 ), gingivitis, periodontal 
disease, hairy leukoplakia or candidiasis

 9.  Ask about previous investigations. Th e patient may be able to give much helpful 
information on previous investigations, including viral load results, T cell CD4  +  counts, 
MRI scans, CT scans, lumbar punctures, bone marrow biopsies and endoscopy. 
 10.  Enquire about social, drug and alcohol history. Th e examiners will expect quite 
detailed knowledge of the patient ’ s social, economic and family circumstances. 
 11.  Ask about risk factors and treatment for cardiovascular disease:
 a.  known ischaemic heart disease – angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 
 b.  smoking – awareness of risk 
 c.  cholesterol level – statin treatment 
 d.  family history of ischaemic heart disease 
 e.  diabetes 
 f.  hypertension – treatment.

 Note especially:
 1.  temperature 
 2.  nutritional state (wasting is common in advanced disease); there may be fat loss on 
the face and fat gain over the limbs (retroviral drug eff ect) 
 3.  skin (e.g. rashes – herpes zoster seborrhoeic dermatitis, exacerbation of psoriasis 
( Fig 13.4 ), molluscum contagiosum – pigmentation and the lesions of Kaposi ’ s 
sarcoma) 
 4.  mouth (e.g. hairy leukoplakia, Kaposi ’ s sarcoma lesions, candida, periodontal disease, 
HSV mouth ulcers) 
 5.  eyes – acuity, visual fi elds and fundoscopy (e.g. CMV retinal lesions) 
 6.  cognition, gait and coordination (e.g. AIDS dementia) 
 7.  chest – cough, sputum, crackles (e.g. opportunistic chest infection) 
 8.  heart – cardiac failure, pericardial disease (e.g. AIDS cardiomyopathy) 
 9.  abdomen – rectal examination, perianal disease (especially warts and HSV) 
 10.  haematological system – lymph nodes and spleen. 
 Investigations 
 Th e patient is likely to have had many tests.
 1.  Th e standard screening test for HIV is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test. It tests against antigens of both HIV1 and HIV2 (the 
latter rare in Australia) and becomes positive in 3–7 weeks after infection so is usually 
negative in primary HIV infection. It has a sensitivity of more than 99%. Its specifi city 
in low-risk populations is only about 90%. False positives can occur related to recent 
vaccinations, other viral infections and autoimmune diseases. Th e earliest detectable test 
 
 
367
13 • Other important long cases
is an HIV PCR DNA (within a few days of inoculation). Th e Western blot test is more 
specifi c and a negative Western blot means a positive EIA test is a false positive. 
 2.  Other tests are used to assess the severity of the illness and immunocompromise, and 
to look for associated conditions (e.g. syphilis) and complications. Th e currently 
relevant tests will depend on the clinical presentation; however, certain tests are 
essential for all patients, either as a baseline or for monitoring ( Table 13.7 ). 
 BASELINE 
 1.  Immune function needs to be established at this point with a full blood count, CD4  +  
level (levels  < 200 cells /  μ L are associated with opportunistic infections) and HIV 
plasma serum viral load. 
 2.  A delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test will help defi ne cellular immune function: 
the lower the CD4  +  (T-helper cell) level ( Table 13.8 ) and the higher the HIV viral 
load, the more advanced is the infection. CD4  +  levels may fall progressively to 
undetectable levels. Aggressive treatment of infections may allow continued survival 
of patients despite these low CD4  +  levels. Antiviral treatment may slow CD4  +  depletion 
or stabilise it for many years. About 5% of infected patients do not develop a reduction 
in CD4  +  counts even after more than 10 years without treatment. Th ese patients are 
called ‘non-progressors’. 
 3.  It should also be established whether the patient has concurrent sexually transmitted 
disease (syphilis serology, hepatitis B serology) or TB (tuberculin test), and whether 
he or she is at risk of activation of latent infection (CMV, toxoplasma serology). 
 4.  Renal and liver function should be checked prior to commencing antiviral drugs.

 MONITORING 
 Th e key investigations for monitoring progress are the HIV plasma viral load and the 
CD4  +  T cell count (see  Table 13.8 ). Serial full blood counts and biochemistry will help 
assess any complications of disease or therapy. 
 Treatment 
 1.  Candidates will be expected to know the clinical features and general treatment 
options for common complications of HIV infection, especially opportunistic infection 
and malignancy. Th is list would include  P. jirovecii ( carinii ) pneumonia, Kaposi ’ s 
sarcoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis, CMV infection,  Mycobacterium avium complex 
(MAC) infection, diarrhoeal syndromes and cryptococcal meningitis. 
 2.  Primary prophylaxis for  P. jirovecii with co-trimoxazole or pentamidine (if CD4  +  
count  < 200 cells /  μ L) and MAC with azithromycin (if CD4  +  count  < 50 cells /  μ L) 
is an important consideration. If the CD4  +  count is  > 200 cells /  μ L for 3 months, 
prophylaxis can be ceased. 
 
 
371
13 • Other important long cases
 3.  Herpes simplex prophylaxis with aciclovir and  Candida prophylaxis with fl uconazole 
or ketoconazole are appropriate for prevention after one episode has occurred. 
 4.  Multiple antiretroviral agents are now available for the treatment of HIV (see  Table 
13.5 ). ART (active antiretroviral therapy) in combination has dramatically improved 
quality of life and life expectancy in HIV disease. 
 5.  Th e optimal time to commence therapy must be considered. It is clear that symptomatic 
patients, or those with an increasing viral load ( > 20,000 copies / mL) or a falling 
CD4  +  count ( < 350 cells /  μ L), are defi nite indications, but most clinicians prefer 
to commence treatment in nearly all cases regardless of CD4  +  count. Pregnant 
infected women should be treated. Drugs should be used only in combination to 
prevent emergence of resistance and most regimens contain three or more drugs. 
Treatment is not curative and must be continued indefi nitely. 
 6.  Standard treatment begins with two NRTs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) 
( Table 13.9 ) and an NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor), or 
protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor together with abacavir or tenofovir. 
 7.  Ongoing patient monitoring is routine. After starting ART, assess adherence and any 
side-eff ects within 2 weeks. Check a blood count, electrolytes and creatinine, liver 
function tests, glucose and lipids, and a urinalysis (depending on the agents used) 
every 3–6 months once stable. Check CD4 counts every 3 months. Assess HIV 
RNA 2 weeks after starting, then every 8 weeks until undetectable, then 3-monthly. 
After 2 years, if the viral load is undetectable, less frequent testing is usual. 
 8.  Resistance testing is indicated for the treatment of the naive patient. Virological 
failure ( > 200 copies / mL) results from lack of adherence or drug resistance, and 
resistance testing is also indicated. 
 9.  ART reduces the risk of vertical transmission and probably also the risk of seroconver-
sion following occupational exposure (e.g. needlestick injury), if given promptly. 
 10.  In pregnancy, the aim of therapy is to make the patient ’ s viral load undetectable. If 
the HIV RNA is more than 1000 copies, recommend caesarean section. Do not use 
dolutegravir. 
 11.  Patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) should have antiviral treatment 
that is also eff ective for that (e.g. lamivudine, emtricitabine). Surveillance for the 
development of hepatic carcinoma is also indicated for these patients. 
 12.  Patients whose disease is well controlled by antiviral agents are more likely to die of 
cardiovascular disease than infection. Th is is partly as a result of their drug treatment 
(e.g. with protease inhibitors). Aggressive control of cardiovascular risk factors is 
indicated ( Table 13.10 ). Hyperlipidaemia should be treated with pravastatin (which 
has less interaction with antiviral drugs).

 Box 13.1   Medications associated with weight gain 
 1.  Steroids 
 2.  Hypoglycaemics – insulin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones 
 3.  Antipsychotics (atypical) – clozapine, risperidone

 The obese patient 
 Th e world of the FRACP long case is a place where there are even more obese patients 
than there are in the real world. Th ese people often have a number of medical problems 
related to their weight. Even when obesity is a minor part of the long case, candidates 
need to have a plausible approach to the problem. 
 If obesity is defi ned as a BMI (body mass / height squared) of 30 or more, about a 
third of adults are obese. 
 The history 
 1.  Ask general questions about the weight:
 a.  the timing of weight gain and variations in weight over time 
 b.  a family history of obesity 
 c.  medications that may have contributed ( Box 13.1 ) 
 d.  exercise – what, how often and for how long each time 
 e.  eating patterns (keep this general or time will disappear) 
 f.  insight into the problem and willingness to address it 
 g.  previous attempts to lose weight 
 h.  mood and symptoms of depression 
 i.  diabetes during pregnancy. 
 2.  Ask about problems associated with obesity and their eff ect on ability to exercise and 
on normal activities:
 a.  arthritis 
 b.  diabetes and its complications and treatment 
 c.  cardiovascular disease and risk factors (hyperlipidaemia, smoking, hypertension) 
 d.  sleep apnoea 
 e.  fatty liver 
 f.  other mobility problems, e.g. balance, bathing 
 g.  shopping for fresh food; ability to cook 
 h.  social life and work. 
 The examination 
 1.  Examine for central obesity. 
 2.  Calculate BMI. 
 
 
375
13 • Other important long cases
 3.  Measure waist circumference at the level of the iliac crest ( > 88 cm for women or  > 
105 cm for men is associated with increased risk of diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hyperten-
sion and heart disease independent of BMI). 
 4.  Take the blood pressure (use a big cuff ). 
 5.  Look for signs of hypothyroidism or Cushing ’ s. 
 6.  Examine for complications of diabetes. 
 Management 
 1.  Suggest management strategies – much depends on a patient ’ s insight and motivation.
 a.  Keep a food diary: can help patients appreciate their food intake accurately. 
 b.  Exercise program: should be tailored to limitations, e.g. arthritis (water aerobics).
 i.  Ways of encouraging exercise include: pedometer, fi tness watch, gymnasium 
program, exercise class. 
 ii.  Remember that exercise alone has modest eff ects on weight loss but can help 
maintain it. 
 c.  Reduce food intake – reduction of food intake by 2000–4000 kilojoules a day will 
cause 400–500 g of weight loss a week. A very low calorie diet may be considered 
for a patient requiring rapid weight loss (e.g. prior to surgery). 
 d.  Dietary advice and behavioural therapy may help. 
 e.  Remember that no particular weight loss diet has been shown to be better than 
any other, but enthusiasm for a particular diet may be valuable. 
 f.  Can any medications be changed? 
 g.  As with any other long-case situation where a change in behaviour is needed, your 
plan should include providing education to ensure understanding of the risks 
involved, involving family members and the patient ’ s GP, setting goals and reviewing 
progress regularly, acknowledging diffi  culties and providing support while applying 
a non-judgmental approach. 
 2.  Drug treatment: 
 a.  has generally been disappointing 
 b.  fat absorption (lipase) inhibitors have a modest benefi t – 8 kg in a year in a 
placebo-controlled study; oily, loose stools are a problem 
 c.  sympathomimetic appetite suppressants tend to work only when being taken 
continuously and have side-eff ects including hypertension and arrhythmias. 
 3.  Surgery: is the only treatment shown to improve prognosis. Type II diabetes mellitus 
may resolve. Th e operations are performed laparoscopically. Th e procedures may 
work partly by reducing gastric ghrelin release, which increases satiety as well as 
restricting intake capacity. Gastric banding has largely been replaced with gastric 
sleeve surgery where part of the stomach is removed. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 
is rarely performed now, but patients who have had the procedure may present to 
exams.  Table 13.11 sets out the eff ectiveness and common complications of the 
operations.
 a.  Surgery is usually reserved for those with BMI  > 40 or  > 35 but with complications 
of obesity. 
 b.  It must have acceptable surgical and anaesthetic risk. 
 c.  Th e patient must be enthusiastic and understand that long-term results still depend 
on changes to diet and exercise. 
 d.  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can be dramatically eff ective and has been shown to 
reduce complications of obesity; however, the late complications of gastric bypass, 
which can include anastomotic stricture, bowel obstruction, marginal ulcer, hernia 
and malabsorption with vitamin defi ciency, have made the operation unusual.

 Management 
 Th e history should help with a calculation of the risk of surgery and suggest measures 
to reduce this risk.
 1.  Heart:
 a.  Consider the cardiac risk score ( Table 13.12 ). 
 b.  Remember that perioperative stress testing is not indicated unless (1) patients have 
a poor exercise tolerance –  < 4 METs (metabolic equivalent of tasks) – pharmacologi-
cal testing may be needed, or (2) many risk factors.

 c.  In general, cardiac revascularisation is not indicated in preparation for non-cardiac 
surgery unless it was already needed. Beta-blocker treatment should not be started 
routinely except for high-risk surgery and for patients with more than one cardiac 
risk factor. 
 d.  Beta-blockers, if needed, should be commenced some weeks before surgery at a 
low dose and adjusted upwards as tolerated. Patients already taking beta-blockers 
should continue them in the perioperative period. 
 e.  Only emergency surgery should be undertaken within 3–6 months of a myocardial 
infarction. 
 f.  Antiplatelet treatment:
 i.  Aspirin should be continued throughout the operative period if possible for all 
patients with known ischaemic heart disease (exceptions include spinal and 
cerebral surgery). 
 ii.  Dual antiplatelet treatment should continue for at least 6 months (3 months 
for urgent surgery with modern drug-eluting stent) from the time of a drug-
eluting stent insertion or acute coronary event and surgery delayed if possible. 
Heparin does not provide protection against stent thrombosis and is not useful 
as bridging treatment for these patients. 
 iii.  Th e second antiplatelet drug can be stopped 1 month after a bare-metal stent 
insertion for stable angina. 
 g.  Anticoagulation:
 i.  Warfarin can be stopped for 3–4 days before surgery and a NOAC 1–2 days 
before for a patient anticoagulated for atrial fi brillation who is at low risk of 
embolic events; otherwise bridging treatment with enoxaparin or unfractionated 
heparin is needed. 
 ii.  Patients with mechanical heart valves need bridging treatment. 
 2.  Lungs:
 a.  Mull over the risk factors for pulmonary complications of surgery (usually prolonged 
postoperative intubation) ( Table 13.13 ). 
 b.  Remember that routine spirometry does not help predict problems and it should 
be reserved for patients with unexplained breathlessness. 
 c.  Smoking cessation at least 2 months before surgery reduces complications, but it 
is not so clear that a shorter period of cessation helps. 
 d.  Deep-breathing exercises and incentive spirometry before and after surgery do 
reduce pulmonary complications.

 3.  Glands:
 a.  Diabetic patients usually stop oral hypoglycaemics up to 12 hours before surgery 
and may require short-acting insulin and frequent blood sugar level measurements. 
Type 1 diabetic patients must continue to receive insulin (because of risk of 
ketoacidosis). 
 b.  Patients with thyroid disease should be euthyroid if possible before surgery. 
 c.  Patient with adrenal insuffi  ciency should be kept well hydrated and receive extra 
doses of hydrocortisone: 25 mg on the day of minor surgery and up to 100–150 mg 
for major surgery. 
 4.  Kidneys:
 a.  ACEIs are often withheld for a few days. 
 b.  Severe chronic kidney disease patients may end up on dialysis temporarily or 
permanently after major surgery (especially cardiac surgery); this must be discussed 
with them before surgery. 
 c.  Extra attention needs to be paid to fl uid balance and the use of renally excreted 
or nephrotoxic drugs. 
 5.  Liver:
 a.  Liver function may worsen in chronic liver disease patients owing to hepatic ischaemia 
during surgery. 
 b.  Anaesthetic and other drugs have an increased half-life and may accumulate. 
 c.  Coagulation may be abnormal. 
 d.  Th e higher the Child–Pugh score the greater is the surgical risk (e.g. Child–Pugh 
B  = 30% risk of death for general surgery). 
 When perioperative risk is only a fragment of the long case, candidates must learn 
to assemble information about risk factors from the patient effi  ciently and make sensible 
suggestions to the examiners about risk and its amelioration. 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  What would you advise the surgeon about  this patient ’ s antiplatelet treatment and 
his or her planned cholecystectomy? 
 2.  What should be done about  this patient who has a mechanical mitral valve and his 
or her warfarin treatment in the perioperative period?

 •  women who have had previous chest irradiation 
 •  women with SLE or scleroderma. 
 Sentinel node biopsy has replaced axillary node dissection. If the node is negative, 
the risk of other node involvement is only about 5% and axillary dissection with its 
associated lymphoedema can be avoided. 
 2.  Radiotherapy: this is not now indicated for most women after surgery, but is used 
if:
 •  the margins are not clear 
 •  the tumour is larger than 5 cm 
 •  there are four or more involved lymph nodes 
 •  the tumour is infl ammatory breast cancer. 
 Th is treatment improves local control and may improve survival. If three nodes 
are involved then adjuvant radiotherapy is more controversial. 
 Adjuvant treatment is meant to help prognosis by removing microscopic residual 
disease. Appropriate adjuvant is guided by:
 •  size of tumour 
 •  progesterone receptor status 
 •  oestrogen receptor status 
 •  over-expression of  HER2 / neu 
 •  hormone receptor negativity 
 •  lymph node involvement 
 •  patient ’ s age and general health. 
 3.  Adjuvant endocrine treatment: endocrine therapy can reduce the risk of recurrence 
by 50% and is indicated for oestrogen- or progesterone-positive cancers. Tamoxifen 
blocks the action of oestrogen on receptors and is used for premenopausal women, 
usually for 5 years. Oophorectomy can be performed for women unable to take 
tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is generally well tolerated, though there are several side-eff ects 
( Box 13.3 ). 
 Aromatase inhibitors are used for postmenopausal women who are receptor positive. 
Th eir side-eff ects are diff erent from those of tamoxifen ( Box 13.4 ). 
 4.  Adjuvant chemotherapy: women younger than 50 years with involved lymph nodes 
should be off ered conventional chemotherapy for 3–6 months. Typical regimens 
include two or three drugs from among:
 •  cyclophosphamide 
 •  anthracyclines 
 Box 13.3   Side-effects of tamoxifen 
 •  Risk of thromboembolism 
 •  Risk of endometrial cancer 
 •  Hot ﬂ ushes 
 •  Cataracts 
 Box 13.4   Side-effects of aromatase inhibitors 
 •  Loss of bone mineral density 
 •  Increased risk of fractures 
 •  Musculoskeletal arthralgia syndrome – symmetrical pain and joint stiffness reversible 
on cessation of treatment

 7.  Ask whether she has been involved in support groups, or has had help with breast 
prostheses, or breast reconstruction. 
 8.  Finally, ask about the eff ect this terrible disease has had on the woman and her family, 
whether she can work and what she knows about her prognosis. 
 Metastatic breast cancer is generally an incurable disease with a median survival 
of 2 years. If secondaries are present at the time of diagnosis then surgical or radiation 
treatment is not used unless there are local symptoms that can be palliated. Surgical 
resection of secondaries does not improve survival. When a secondary is a recurrence 
of tumour, biopsy is necessary in most cases as the secondary may have diff erent 
hormone receptors. 
 Hormone-receptor-positive tumours are treated with endocrine therapy, starting 
with tamoxifen in premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal 
women. Ovarian ablation can be used for premenopausal women. If the tumour has 
over-expression of  HER2 /  neu , trastuzumab and chemotherapy are used. Triple 
receptor-negative tumours are treated with sequential single-agent chemotherapy. 
Combination chemotherapy is more toxic and does not improve survival. Metastatic 
bone disease can be treated with bisphosphonates. Dental monitoring is required 
because of the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Painful bony secondaries are treated 
with local radiotherapy. 
 
 Possible lines of questioning 
 1.  How do you feel  this woman has coped with her Illness? 
 2.  How would you manage  this woman ’ s painful bony metastases? 
 3.  What would you tell  this woman about the problems that might occur when she 
begins treatment with tamoxifen?

 Think like a physician, think like 
an examiner – an approach with 
long-case examples 
 I should have liked to be asked to say what I knew. 
They always tried to ask what I did not know. When I 
would have willingly displayed my knowledge, they 
sought to expose my ignorance. This sort of treatment 
had only one result: I did not do well in examinations.

 CASE 1  
 Mr AH is a 76-year-old retired stockbroker. He is an outpatient. 
 Problem list provided to the examiners (reviewed after blinded 
clinical evaluation by the examiners): 
 1.  Type 2 diabetes. 
 2.  Asthma. 
 3.  Hypertension. 
 4.  Muscle cramps secondary to statin use. 
 5.  Carcinoma of the prostate. 
 6.  Carcinoma of the colon. 
 7.  Social aspects. 
 8.  Knee replacements. 
 Mr AH was due to have CT scans of his chest abdomen and pelvis as 
follow-up of his two malignancies and felt anxious about the results of these 
tests. 
 Carcinoma of the prostate was diagnosed in 2011 after a screening 
prostate-speciﬁ c antigen (PSA) test. Management was radical prostatectomy and 
external radiotherapy. 
 He had a period of urinary incontinence, which has now resolved. 
 There was minor radiation proctitis. 
 Carcinoma of the colon was diagnosed in 2014 after a positive screening 
faecal occult blood test – anterior resection but no colostomy. 
 Several adjacent lymph nodes were involved. 
 His postoperative course was complicated by a period of bowel obstruction 
and he required parenteral feeding for 10 days. 
 He had a course of chemotherapy including, he thought, 5-ﬂ uorouracil 
(5FU) and a platinum-based drug. The main complications were 
nausea and painless peripheral neuropathy. The neuropathy has 
improved slightly. 
 Follow-up colonoscopies and CT scans have been normal so far. 
 There have been no bowel symptoms apart from some mild diarrhoea. 
 Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 2011. It has only ever been treated with 
diet. He has lost no weight since the diagnosis and is currently 100 kg (BMI 30). 
His HbA 1C recently was 6.1. He has had no identiﬁ ed complications of diabetes. 
He checks his blood sugar level every few days. 
 He has had a recent episode of cough, wheeze and fever. 
 He reports recurrent childhood asthma, but no problems with missing 
school and no admissions to hospital. 
 His chest symptoms occur almost every winter and are debilitating; he 
produces large volumes of discoloured sputum. 
 He has been given ﬁ ve courses of antibiotics this year. 
 He thinks one set of sputum cultures has been performed, but doesn ’ t know 
the result. 
 There have been no chest investigations for years. 
 Last year he had a nasal polyp removed. 
 
 
386
Examination Medicine
 Has frequent problems with a blocked nose and symptoms of sinusitis, 
which usually precede his chest symptoms; sometimes he uses intranasal 
steroids. 
 He has often been treated with a course of prednisone for 10 days by his 
local doctor for these illnesses. 
 He uses regular seretide, 2 puffs mane and salbutamol as required. 
 He has been treated for hypertension for 6 years with candesartan / 
hydrochlorothiazide. 
 He has been told he has a heart murmur, which needs review in a few years. 
 He associated the use of two different statins with muscle pains in the legs 
and has stopped them; he is unsure of his untreated cholesterol level. 
 He is moderately active; he plays golf using a cart and walks 3 km on 5 days 
a week. He is mostly limited by joint problems – two previous knee 
replacements and chronic back pain and two previous laminectomies – but also 
by dyspnoea and wheeze. 
 His wife, who is affected by dementia, has been admitted in the last few 
weeks to a nursing home that is half an hour ’ s drive away. He drives to visit her 
6 days a week. He lives with his 48-year-old son, who works but is mildly 
mentally retarded. He has three other children whom he sees often. 
 He smoked until 25 years ago and has a 25-packet-year history of smoking. 
He drinks four or ﬁ ve glasses of wine a day. 
 When asked what troubled him most, he described his worry about his 
forthcoming screening tests and the limitations caused by his frequent 
respiratory symptoms. 
 Examination 
 1.  Obesity. 
 2.  Abdominal and back and knee scars. 
 3.  BP 135 / 70 mmHg; pulse 75 / minute and regular. 
 4.  There were occasional expiratory wheezes; his cough was dry. 
 5.  He had signs of mild aortic regurgitation and stenosis. 
 6.  Peripheral neuropathy in stocking distribution – his hands were unaffected. 
Reﬂ exes were absent distally and proprioception and vibration sense was reduced. 
 Discussion 
 First examiner 
 1.  Diagnosis of respiratory symptoms: asthma versus COPD. Possibility of 
bronchiectasis. What investigations are indicated, e.g. CXR, HRCT of the chest, 
sputum culture (possibility of unusual organisms, e.g. atypical mycobacteria, 
 Pseudomonas )? Investigation of sinusitis because this seemed to precipitate 
attacks. IgE for bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Lifelong problem of recurrent 
infections – consider immunodeﬁ ciency and investigate. Consider aspirin 
sensitivity; however, he takes regular aspirin without difﬁ culty. 
 2.  Management of respiratory problems: once-daily seretide – is this appropriate? Is 
intermittent steroid treatment appropriate? Management of sinusitis, e.g. regular 
inhaled nasal steroids. Should he have antibiotics or steroids at home for use at 
onset of symptoms? Would postural drainage, a ﬂ utter valve or physiotherapy be 
helpful for his productive cough? 
 
 
387
14 • Think like a physician, think like an examiner – an approach with long-case examples
 3.  Is candidate happy with the current management of follow-up of the two 
malignancies? What to do if PSA is up again? Is it worth checking the CEA? 
 4.  Strategy for treating lipids in view of his intolerance to statins. 
 5.  Management of possible peripheral neuropathy. 
 Second examiner 
 1.  How is he managing at home? Does he have problems with depression? Does he 
drink too much? What would you say to him about this? 
 2.  Management of valvular disease. Which is the more signiﬁ cant lesion? 
 COMMENTS 
 This man appeared well and might have been included in the exam 
because of his two malignancies, but the more signiﬁ cant unresolved 
problem was his recurrent productive cough. Relevant issues relating to the 
pharmacological management could include review of sputum cultures for 
sensitivity guided therapy, use of a spacer, use of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 
hypertonic saline in the case of underlying bronchiectasis, spacer technique and 
vaccination. Non-pharmacological measures include pulmonary exercise 
rehabilitation, house dust mite eradication (if allergic), and assessment of 
overlapping disordered sleep breathing. Discussions regarding goals of care may 
be highly relevant. This is an excellent topic for discussion and it is likely the 
examiners would be keen to pursue this problem. You would also want to talk 
about diabetes management and cancer surveillance. 
 CASE 2  
 Mr RD is a 66-year-old retired public servant. 
 Problem list provided to examiners 
 1.  Antibody deﬁ ciency. 
 2.  Chronic wound on right thigh, previous necrotising fasciitis. 
 3.  Type 2 diabetes. 
 4.  Ischaemic heart disease. 
 5.  Hypertension. 
 6.  Hypercholesterolaemia. 
 7.  Obstructive sleep apnoea. 
 8.  Gastro-oesophageal reﬂ ux. 
 9.  Hypothyroidism. 
 10.  Opioid dependence. 
 11.  Subacute bowel obstruction. 
 12.  Inﬂ ammatory bowel disease, proctocolectomy in 2003. 
 His gut problems began in 2001 with bloody diarrhoea and a diagnosis of 
inﬂ ammatory bowel disease. 
 Biopsies were more suggestive of Crohn ’ s colitis and he was treated for a 
few years with steroids and azathioprine. He was intolerant of sulfasalazine. 
 Biological agents were not available at that time and poor control of his 
symptoms led to a proctocolectomy and the need for an ileostomy drainage bag. 
 
 
388
Examination Medicine
He had further surgery with relocation of his stoma in 2011 because of a 
parastomal infection. 
 There were recurrent admissions to hospital with subacute bowel 
obstruction. Opioid dependency developed at this stage. 
 In 2014 he had further surgery to relieve adhesions, which was largely 
successful. 
 His stoma works continuously and he empties it three times a day. 
 He does not know how much of the small bowel was resected. 
 His appetite has been poor since the wound problems and he has lost 
20 kg. He takes Ensure supplements. 
 Two years ago he had surgical removal of two skin lesions on his right thigh. 
The wound broke down and numerous further operations were performed. The 
wound was complicated by necrotising fasciitis. Various organisms, including  E. 
coli spp., were cultured. He has a photographic record of the wound, which he 
was keen to show. An immunoglobulin deﬁ ciency was diagnosed after 
investigations for failure of his wound to heal. He has intermittent human IV 
immunoglobin infusions. 
 He had two myocardial infarctions in 2002 and then a stent to the right 
coronary artery in 2003. He describes recurrent episodes of what he called 
‘unstable angina’ requiring admission to hospital and narcotic analgesics in 
2015, but an angiogram showed his stent was patent and there was no 
obstructive disease. His chest pain was atypical and not associated with ECG 
changes. 
 There was a history of hyperlipidaemia and hypertension, currently treated 
with atorvastatin 10 mg, and he is not currently on antihypertensives. He has 
not smoked for 18 years. 
 He takes clopidogrel rather than aspirin because of gastrointestinal 
side-effects associated with aspirin. 
 Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 2004. He measures his blood sugar level 
‘randomly’; results are between 4.5 and 9 mmol / L and he does not know his 
HbA 1C . 
 He has regular eye checks and has no nerve problems. 
 Metformin was associated with diarrhoea and he takes glimepiride. This 
dose has been reduced because of episodes of hypoglycaemia. He believes his 
renal function is normal. 
 He has had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea; this appears to be mild 
and is not being treated. 
 He lives at home with his wife, who is well. His son died 3 years ago from 
complications of type 1 diabetes. He has no particular ﬁ nancial worries. He 
drives and is moderately physically active. He uses morphine on a daily basis for 
thigh pain. 
 Examination 
 1.  He appeared well nourished. 
 2.  Blood pressure 130 / 80 mmHg, pulse 65 / minute and regular. No signs of heart 
failure. 
 3.  The thigh wound was almost healed, except for a small area at the lower margin. 
 
 
389
14 • Think like a physician, think like an examiner – an approach with long-case examples
 4.  The stoma appeared satisfactory and the abdominal examination was otherwise 
normal. 
 5.  There was no peripheral neuropathy. 
 Discussion 
 First examiner 
 1.  History and management of IBD, including malabsorption and nutrition. 
 2.  Ischaemic heart disease. 
 3.  Candidates could be asked to speculate on the original cause of the thigh wound. 
Remember pyoderma gangrenosum and necrobiosis diabeticorum. Discussion 
about the slow healing should consider his antibody deﬁ ciencies as well as his 
Crohn ’ s disease. The recurrent infection with bowel organisms and curious 
photographic record of the wound might make you think about a factitious cause. 
 4.  While discussing the management of his IBD, also consider investigation of 
possible malabsorption, e.g. vitamin B 12 deﬁ ciency, and tests for this, e.g. blood 
count, serum albumin, folate and B 12 levels, vitamin D. 
 Second examiner 
 1.  Possible ischaemic heart disease would lead to a standard spiel about risk factor 
control. But don ’ t take the patient ’ s assertion that he had experienced recent 
acute coronary syndromes at face value. Make sure you ask about the 
characteristics of the symptoms. Think: is the diagnosis incompatible with the 
angiography ﬁ ndings? What about the inﬂ uence of the opioid dependence on the 
symptoms? 
 2.  You may be keen to wheel out your usual diabetes presentation, but you may not 
be allowed to by the examiners. 
 There may be time for a brief discussion of the opioid problem. Be prepared 
to discuss issues relating to a behaviour change in a thorough but succinct 
manner. This allows more time to spend discussing other issues that you may 
be more expert in. Your response should be personalised and directly relevant to 
your patient (what has worked before, who are their support network, what is 
their understanding of the implications, etc.), and should include engaging other 
healthcare professionals, having a plan for follow-up and emphasis on 
establishing a good therapeutic relationship. Simply referring the patient will 
likely be graded as unsatisfactory by the examiners. 
 COMMENTS 
 This complicated patient could provide good candidates with an opportunity to 
look beyond what they were told to achieve a high mark. Never blindly believe 
the history – look for evidence to support your diagnoses, and always consider a 
different diagnosis in every long case (and in clinical practice). 
 CASE 3  
 Mrs AB is a 37-year-old outpatient and former hospital nurse. She has been 
unable to work for some years because of her illness. 
 In 2012, 2 weeks after the birth of her third child, she developed joint pains 
and swelling of the hands and feet. She had not had any rashes. 
 
 
390
Examination Medicine
 Investigations at the time led to a diagnosis of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). 
 She was treated with prednisone doses varying from 10 to 30 mg. 
 Steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine and mycophenalate were tried, 
but led to side-effects; however, she is not sure what these were. Methotrexate 
caused febrile neutropenia. Diclofenac and hydroxychloroquine were not very 
effective. 
 In 2013 she had an episode of pleuritic chest pain, was diagnosed with 
pericarditis and was admitted to hospital and treated with prednisone, starting 
with 40 mg. Her symptoms resolved over a few days. 
 In 2014 she had sudden loss of vision in one eye and retinal vein 
thrombosis was found. She was then diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome 
and began treatment with warfarin. 
 In 2014–15 she had recurrent  Nocardia infections – skin, muscles (calf ) and 
brain. There was no neurological deﬁ cit, but she had severe headache. This was 
treated successfully with co-trimoxazole. 
 In 2015 she developed left-sided paraesthesiae and vertigo. A transient 
ischaemic attack (TIA) was diagnosed. A CT of the brain and carotid Dopplers 
were normal. Aspirin was added to her treatment. 
 In 2016 a pruritic rash developed on her legs and the co-trimoxazole was 
stopped. 
 Her steroid use was associated with a number of problems: weight gain 
from 65 to 95 kg; her BMI is now 35; she developed gestational diabetes 
needing insulin, but is now taking metformin. She is unsure of her current blood 
sugar level (BSL); she checks it every 4 days or so. She has not had a 
hypoglycaemic episode; she doesn ’ t know her glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ). 
 She smokes 15 cigarettes a day and her husband also smokes. 
 She looks after her three children at home; once a week she rides a bike with 
them, but her joints become very sore afterwards. 
 Joint symptoms and muscle weakness limit household work (e.g. putting out 
washing). Her husband works 6  × 12-hour days. She gets some support from 
her family at home. 
 She has an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception and per vaginam 
(PV) bleeding has improved with a progesterone device. 
 There have been no other rashes. 
 She has no kidney disease as far as she knows. There has not been a 
problem with hypertension. 
 Her last INR was 1.4. She has monthly tests. 
 Her eyes are reviewed regularly. 
 She is keen to work again as a nurse or clerk, but has been told by her 
doctors that this is not possible. 
 She sees her main problem as her inability to work and exercise. 
 Examination 
 On the day of the exam the important examination findings were:
 1.  She was Cushingoid. 
 2.  There was swelling without deformity involving the hands and wrists. 
 
 
391
14 • Think like a physician, think like an examiner – an approach with long-case examples
 3.  She had a healing rash on the legs (probably co-trimoxazole associated). 
 4.  Her BP was 130 / 90 mmHg. 
 5.  There was mild proximal muscle weakness – she could stand with effort from a 
chair without using her arms. 
 6.  The left fundus was pale with 6 / 12 vision.

 Second examiner 
 1.  Contraception issues; aspects relating to management during possible pregnancy. 
 2.  Prognosis and psychological state, patient ’ s view of her main problem. 
 COMMENTS 
 1.  Management problems of SLE and its treatment. 
 2.  Complicated history needs to be presented succinctly and logically – probably best 
given chronologically. 
 3.  Some common management areas for discussion (e.g. diabetes). This needs to 
be done smoothly – should be straightforward so a high standard would be 
expected. 
 4.  Indication for and management of anticoagulation and management of initial or 
recurrent pericarditis are very likely areas for discussion depending on time 
available. Much detail about patient ’ s management and understanding of warfarin 
will be expected. You would need to know where and how often INR readings are 
taken, how result is communicated to patient and who makes dose adjustments. 
What happened after the last reading of 1.4? 
 5.  Management of stroke / TIA could be asked about, and use of warfarin and 
aspirin. 
 6.  Plenty of scope for discussion of effect of illness on family, income, work, 
self-esteem and so on. 
 7.  Need to be able to show how you would discuss the prognosis with the patient; 
this usually requires you to elicit an understanding of the factors limiting 
prognosis and their management rather than estimating the life expectancy.

 CASE 4  
 Mr BC is a 68-year-old accountant in full-time work. He has come in for the 
exam from home. He has a younger wife and his youngest child is only 5 years 
old. 
 He has had a recent admission to hospital with a chest infection and was 
diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
 In 2001 he was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD). He had a 
biopsy but the diagnosis was unclear, at least to him. He was treated with 
haemodialysis for 18 months. He still has a functioning ﬁ stula in the left arm. 
 In 2002 he had a cadaveric transplant. Immunosuppression was with 
prednisone and azathioprine. 
 In 2003 he developed gout and was treated with colchicine and allopurinol. 
There has been no recurrence. 
 Azathioprine led to bone marrow suppression, admission to hospital and a 
requirement for blood transfusion. Azathioprine was stopped and cyclosporin 
started. 
 His current creatinine is 250  μ mol / L. He doesn ’ t know his eGFR (estimated 
glomerular ﬁ ltration rate), but says his creatinine has been stable for many years, 
but had increased to 270  μ mol / L during his recent admission. 
 His cyclosporin dose was reduced last year and mycophenolate was added 
to his treatment. 
 He is not worried about his current renal function. 
 In 2012 he had left and then right hip replacements. He thinks the left was 
because of avascular necrosis and the right was because of osteoarthritis. He is 
not aware of having had any bone density assessments. 
 His recent admission was with dyspnoea and productive cough – antibiotics 
and steroids were used to treat this, but have now been stopped. 
 COPD was diagnosed, but his spirometry measurements were not abnormal 
as far as he knows. He smoked until 5 years ago – 25 packet-years altogether. 
 His cough is still productive. He can walk 200 m on the ﬂ at; he plays golf 
with a cart. 
 He is being treated with Symbicort II (budesonide-formoterol), 2 puffs twice 
daily and salbutamol, 2 puffs PRN. 
 Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was diagnosed in 2012. He snores and has 
mild daytime sleepiness, but never when driving. His sleep study was positive. 
He has been unable to tolerate a mask. 
 He has been overweight for many years and is currently 140 kg for 2 m of 
height. He has been unable to lose weight despite insight into his problem. 
 He has a long history of hypertension, which has been difﬁ cult to control 
since he developed kidney disease. His current treatment for this includes: 
diltiazem 180 mg daily, candesartan 16 mg daily, prazosin 5 mg BD and 
hydralazine 50 mg BD. 
 He had angioedema with an ACEI, and his angiotensin II receptor blocker 
(ARB) was initiated in hospital. 
 In 2015 he had symptomatic atrial ﬁ brillation requiring two cardioversions. 
He takes amiodarone 200 mg twice daily for this and has had no symptomatic

recurrences. He is anticoagulated with warfarin. His INR target is 2–3 and he is 
having weekly blood tests. His INR was 5.4 during admission when on 
antibiotics. He has had no bleeding problems. 
 He has peripheral oedema, which is worse with diltiazem. He has 
never used support stockings, but takes frusemide 80 mg daily. An episode of 
cellulitis in the legs occurred 2 years ago and required treatment with IV 
antibiotics. 
 He still works and supports his family (sedentary job, good employer), but 
he is not sure for how much longer he will be able to continue. He feels his 
breathlessness is his worst problem. 
 Examination 
 The examination revealed:
 1.  Obesity. 
 2.  BP 120 / 80 mmHg, pulse 80 regular.

 6.  Reduced chest expansion. 
 7.  Soft systolic ejection murmur, apex beat not palpable. 
 8.  Peripheral oedema moderately severe and venous staining. 
 9.  Transplant palpable in abdomen, left arm ﬁ stulae working. 
 Test results available to examiners:

over-inﬂ ated chest. 
 2.  ECG left bundle branch block, sinus rhythm. 
 3.  Spirometry FEV 1 / FVC 71% little reversibility. 
 4.  Echo severe left ventricular dyssynchrony, dilated left atrium, systolic function 
preserved. 
 Discussion 
 First examiner 
 1.  a. What does patient see as his main problem? Does COPD explain all the 
symptoms and signs?
 b.  What are the other possibilities, e.g. bronchiectasis, pneumocystis, 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis? 
 c.  How to investigate and manage? 
 2.  a. Current renal function satisfactory or a problem?
 b.  What measures to investigate and treat, e.g. BP, chronic rejection, 
cyclosporin? 
 c.  Surveillance of current antirejection treatment, e.g. full blood count, skin, blood 
levels, indications for kidney biopsy? 
 3.  AF management, amiodarone toxicity and surveillance, warfarin management. 
 4.  Peripheral oedema signiﬁ cance and management – calcium antagonists, venous 
problems, right heart failure – any signs of this?

Examination Medicine
 Second examiner 
 1.  Obstructive sleep apnoea management – what else to do? 
 2.  Chronic illness, work, money, etc. Patient insight into his prognosis? 
 3.  Obesity – what approach? (if time) 
 COMMENTS 
 A long case with a number of active problems:
 1.  Recent lung disease perhaps not explained by COPD. 
 2.  Renal function possibly deteriorating despite patient ’ s claim of stable creatinine. 
 3.  Opportunity to discuss management of surveillance of antirejection Rx. 
 4.  Management of AF, and warfarin and amiodarone. 
 5.  Approach to peripheral oedema not always or even usually heart failure, but 
possibility of right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. 
 6.  OSA and obesity. 
 The examiners would be keen for a differential diagnosis of his dyspnoea 
and lung disease, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. You 
would want to talk about transplant surveillance and management. There would 
be time for both. 
 CASE 5  
 Mr WP is a 60-year-old wheat farmer who is currently in hospital 100 km away 
from his home and farm. 
 In 2013 he discovered a painless testicular mass. There were no sweats or 
fevers. He underwent a single orchidectomy. He was unable to remember a 
preceding biopsy. Lymphoma was diagnosed. 
 He was treated with eight cycles of R-CHOP treatment delayed by drug 
side-effects (fever, oedema), but completed in 8 months and followed by 
maintenance rituximab. 
 In 2016 he relapsed. He developed back pain and left leg weakness. There were 
no bowel or bladder symptoms. He was admitted to hospital for 5 months and was 
unable to walk. There was numbness of the left leg and a necrotic ulcer developed 
on the heel. There was little improvement in power while he was in hospital. 
 He then had an episode of diplopia and ptosis without associated headache. 
 An MRI of the brain was performed. He was unsure of the result. During the 
same admission he had an episode of chest pain and dyspnoea. A CT 
pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed pulmonary embolism. 
 He was treated with intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate and 
anticoagulated with warfarin. An episode of pleuritic chest pain was diagnosed 
as pericarditis. He is not sure how this was treated. 
 He is currently awaiting autologous bone marrow transplant, having had 
stem cell harvesting. 
 He has lost 15 kg during this illness. 
 In the past he had a stroke in 2012. This was treated with clopidogrel. 
 A transoesophageal echo showed a patent foramen ovale (PFO). He had a 
long history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. He was never a smoker.

14 • Think like a physician, think like an examiner – an approach with long-case examples
 His main worries about his health are about his prospects of recovery and 
return to his family and the farm, which is currently being managed with 
difﬁ culty by his son. 
 Examination 
 1.  Left foot drop with S1 and L5 loss of sensation. 
 2.  Absent reﬂ exes in the left leg. 
 3.  Moderate weakness of knee extension and ﬂ exion, mild weakness at hip. 
 4.  Right leg normal power and reﬂ exes. 
 5.  Absent right testis. 
 6.  Eye movements normal. 
 Investigations available to the examiners
 1.  Histology – large B cell lymphoma. 
 2.  MRI brain-thickening of right 3rd nerve within the prepontine cistern. 
 3.  MRI of foot showed osteomyelitis. 
 4.  CTPA showed a pulmonary embolus in the lateral segment of the right middle 
lobe. 
 5.  MRI of lumbar spine showed retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy on the left side of 
the pelvis and involvement from L4 to the sacral nerves extending to the cauda 
equina nerve roots. 
 Discussion 
 First examiner 
 1.  Management of lymphoma and bone marrow transplant:
 a.  a common transplant problem, immunosuppression surveillance 
 b.  lymphoma staging – presentation with non-lymph-node involvement and no B 
symptoms – implications for prognosis 
 c.  common side-effects of R-CHOP and rituximab 
 Appropriate tests (as above) and their interpretation. 
 2.  Management of osteomyelitis. 
 3.  Management of leg weakness – including rehabilitation. 
 4.  Loss of independence and prognosis. 
 Second examiner 
 1.  Anticoagulation – management of TIA and PFO, use of clopidogrel versus aspirin. 
 2.  Ability to work, run farm, etc. How has he coped with 5 months in hospital, far 
from his family? 
 COMMENTS 
 A complicated case involving:
 1.  diagnosis of lymphoma – discussion about staging, etc. 
 2.  complications of treatment, ﬁ rst of drugs and then theoretically about 
complications of bone marrow transplant 
 3.  disease recurrence with a variety of neurological problems and problems of 
immobility – necrotic ulcer, psychological 
 4.  signiﬁ cant examination ﬁ ndings 
 5.  need for anticoagulation; opportunity to discuss warfarin management 
 
 
396
Examination Medicine
 6.  investigation of possible cerebral ischaemic episode, signiﬁ cance of PFO 
 7.  patient ’ s concerns about his prognosis: loss of income, separation from family, 
long period in hospital – all possible areas for discussion. 
 The examiners have plenty to choose from and are likely to want to discuss 
some problems in detail and to ensure the candidate has thought about the 
others by asking a few questions on each. 
 CASE 6  
 Mrs AP is a 72-year-old retired nurse who has come in for the exams. 
 She has a long history of hypertension, which has recently been difﬁ cult to 
control. A CT of the renal arteries showed ‘thickening’. 
 She smoked for 18 years until 10 years ago. She has had lower back pain for 
10 years, which was not relieved by a laminectomy. Spinal canal stenosis was 
diagnosed 4 years ago. 
 She has had a gain in weight over the last 5 years from 88 to 107 kg. Her 
BMI is 40. 
 A thyroidectomy was performed in 2013 following a biopsy that showed 
atypical cells. The tumour, however, was benign. 
 She is breathless on mild exertion, but not at rest. 
 She had a right hip replacement in 2005. 
 In 2015 she had a left hip replacement. She became very dyspnoeic 5 weeks 
later, with investigations for a DVT. There were multiple pulmonary emboli, but 
no DVT was found. She was treated with enoxaparin and then warfarin for 10 
months. 
 Currently she can walk 30 metres on the ﬂ at. She is limited by dyspnoea and 
knee pain. 
 She has been diagnosed with asthma and an allergy to cats and dogs. She 
has three cats at home. 
 She suffered from childhood chest infections and sinusitis but no ear 
infections. She coughs up little phlegm and has never had an admission to 
hospital with asthma, or required steroid treatment. 
 In 2004 hypogammaglobulinaemia was diagnosed. She was given 
vaccinations for inﬂ uenza, whooping cough, pneumonia (possibly 
pneumococcus and  Haemophilus inﬂ uenzae ) and hepatitis. 
 She now receives monthly gammaglobulin injections. These were given IM 
for 5 years, then IV. She feels she is much improved and requires only one or 
two courses of antibiotics per year now. 
 She is currently taking atenolol 50 mg a day for hypertension and detected 
ventricular bigeminy (asymptomatic). She had had problems with previously 
prescribed ACEIs and ARBs, but can ’ t remember what they were. 
 She is unable to drive and goes out only with a frame. Her husband does 
the shopping and housework. 
 Her main concern about her health was her back pain. She was not 
especially worried about her immobility or her weight.

 Examination 
 1.  Obese. 
 2.  BP 150 / 80 mmHg. 
 3.  Able to walk with great difﬁ culty, but not apparently concerned. 
 4.  Chest clear. 
 5.  Forced expiratory time (FET) normal – 5 s. 
 Discussion 
 First examiner 
 1.  History of childhood infections and asthma: Was this typical of 
hypogammaglobulinaemia? Did she have time off school? Admissions to 
hospital? Inability to play sport, etc.? 
 2.  Dyspnoea – current causes: obesity, asthma, PE, or something else? How to 
investigate? 
 3.  Back pain – has this been nocturnal? Is its current treatment satisfactory? This is 
her main worry. 
 4.  Obesity – is she serious about weight loss? What is her attitude to illness? Is 
there some secondary gain? 
 5.  Asthma – she has pets at home to which she is said to be allergic. How severe is 
it? Is current treatment satisfactory? 
 6.  Immobility – what might be done? 
 Second examiner 
 1.  What risks would further surgery involve? How would you advise her 
anaesthetist? 
 2.  Hypertension – is it well controlled? Is there a need to investigate and consider 
renal artery angioplasty? Discuss use of a beta-blocker. 
 3.  Does she have a GP coordinating her case? Does she have an advance care 
directive? 
 COMMENTS 
 1.  Problem of a patient enthusiastic about her illnesses. 
 2.  Sometimes difﬁ cult to get to the point during history-taking, but of course a 
problem for examiners as well. A more efﬁ cient approach when obtaining the 
history here would be to start with the current management of each condition, 
including medications, follow-up and complications, before returning to try and 
tease out the detailed chronological sequence. 
 3.  Any illness that begins in childhood requires questions about its effect on 
education – time off school, playing of sport, socialising with other children and 
effect on ﬁ nal level of education. 
 4.  Discussion about treatment of problems that seem severe, e.g. immobility, but do 
not really seem to worry the patient. 
 5.  Some more straightforward medical problems, e.g. hypertension, possible renal 
artery stenosis, use of beta-blockers for an asthmatic. 
 This case has an interesting mix of signiﬁ cant medical but also of social, 
and perhaps psychiatric, problems. A good candidate needs a sensible and 
realistic approach to these probably insoluble aspects of the case.

 CASE 7  
 Mrs CE is a 73-year-old outpatient with chronic renal failure and on 
haemodialysis. 
 The aetiology of her CKD was suspected to be analgesic nephropathy; she 
used large doses of aspirin and paracetamol for headaches for 25 years and 
stopped 30 years ago. 
 She has now been dialysing for 2 years. She has 5 hours three times a week. 
Her right arm ﬁ stula works well. She has had recurrent renal ‘stones’. 
 She doesn ’ t know her dry weight and is unsure about ﬂ uid, salt or dietary 
restrictions. She remembers having had some parathyroid problems while on 
tablets in 2014. Her calcium levels were too low and the tablets were stopped. 
 In 2012 her renal failure was precipitated after an episode of pancreatitis 
requiring ICU admission. She remembers severe abdominal pain, but little else of 
this illness. The pancreatitis has meant she is not suitable for peritoneal dialysis. 
 She passes no urine. 
 In 2009 she swallowed a ﬁ sh bone and developed peritonitis and required 
emergency surgery. 
 In the past she drank 6–8 whiskies a day (more when friends visited) for 10 
years. She is now a non-drinker. 
 She thinks her liver is normal now. There have been no problems with it or 
with exocrine pancreatic function. 
 Hypertension was diagnosed after this illness and is being treated with 
metoprolol 50 mg daily. 
 There is some exertional dyspnoea but no orthopnoea. Her back limits her 
more than shortness of breath. This has been present since she was assaulted 
by her ﬁ rst husband over many years. 
 She needs a knee replacement. She has had both her hips and the left knee 
replaced. Three lots of back surgery have been performed following her injuries. 
A new left knee replacement has been recommended after she fell on her knee a 
few months ago. 
 She has no history of ischaemic heart disease. She does not know whether 
her cholesterol level is elevated. She smoked for 20 years until 10 years ago. 
 There is a history of gout many years ago. 
 Her medications include:
 • 
 analgesics for her back (she is not sure what these are at the moment) 
 • 
 Aranesp monthly (she doesn ’ t know her current haemoglobin). 
 She ﬁ rst married at 16, and had a very difﬁ cult life with ﬁ rst husband. 
 She cannot drive. Her husband brings her to dialysis 40 minutes from home 
and does all the housework, shopping and cooking. He is very different from her 
ﬁ rst husband, whom she divorced 29 years ago. She remarried 5 years ago. She 
has two children, one of whom lives locally. 
 Gallstones have been found and an endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) recommended. Gallstones were not found at 
the time of her pancreatitis. 
 She is very happy in her second marriage. Her main concern about her 
health is her immobility and constant back pain.

 2.  Dialysis problems: diet, calcium levels, drugs, cardiovascular protection. 
 3.  Patient ’ s understanding of her illness. 
 4.  Back pain management (one of her main concerns). 
 5.  Is she a candidate for a transplant? Screening for transitional cell carcinoma. 
 Second examiner 
 1.  Fitness for knee surgery. 
 2.  Signiﬁ cance of murmur. 
 COMMENTS 
 1.  This case involves the usual discussion about CKD and dialysis: cause of renal 
failure, choice of type of dialysis, patient ’ s understanding of illness – dry weight, 
diet, haemoglobin, etc. 
 2.  Analgesic nephropathy is now a rare cause of CKD, but candidates need to know 
something about it – including the risk of transitional cell carcinoma. 
 3.  This woman had a very difﬁ cult life for many years with her ﬁ rst husband and now 
copes with her chronic illness cheerfully – some details about her domestic 
problems and their effect on her current state of mind are important. 
 4.  Common further questions would involve asking about your management of her 
back pain and discussion of her suitability for knee surgery and transplant. These 
may not have clear-cut answers, but a sensible approach would be expected.

start with the eyes. Th e stem means that the problem will be somewhere between nerves 
VII and XII, so start with VII. In the short-case examination of a patient with bron-
chiectasis, the stem may be: ‘Th is man has a cough. Please examine him.’ Th e patient 
would have an obviously loose cough, typical of bronchiectasis. Candidates who ask the 
patient to cough would be off  to a great start, but those who do not ask him to cough 
may risk a much poorer score. In reality, there is plenty of time, but you certainly do 
not want to run out of time before getting to the problem the examiners have raised. 
 Th e stem is never a trick. Th e examiner will become quite anxious if candidates begin 
to perform the wrong examination (e.g. a neurological examination of the hands when 
the problem is rheumatoid arthritis). 
 Timing 
 Th e time allowed for each short case is 15 minutes. Having a sense of time even early 
on in your exam preparation is always helpful. Th is means that time should be available 
for both examination and discussion. Patients are not really included just as quick ‘spot 
diagnosis’ cases alone, but if you do ‘spot the diagnosis’ it will be a golden opportunity 
to demonstrate systematically the associated signs in full. Th e examiners will expect a 
higher standard of examination when the diagnosis is fairly obvious. 
 Marking 
 With the previous marking system, a candidate could fail all the short cases and still 
pass the examination. Th is changed in 2014 so that everyone must pass at least one 
short case. Th e new marking system is more complicated in that passing no longer 
depends on achieving a certain mark and passing one short case but rather is calculated 
from a grid. Th e aim is that candidates should not pass unless one short case is passed. 
Th e most common short cases are cardiovascular and neurological problems. We suggest 
that candidates aim to examine each short case profi ciently within 8 minutes. 
 Hand washing 
 Remember that infectious diseases physicians are everywhere. Ask to wash or wipe your 
hands before going into the short-case room (and do it). Th e examiners do not usually 
want you to wash them in the examination room because of the delay involved, but 
look around for somewhere to wash as you go out. 
 HINT 
 Wash your hands before and after examining. Some candidates keep a small bottle of 
hand gel in their bags so that they can be seen to wash their hands and are not delayed 
by having to search the room. 
 Starting off 
 It is a good idea, when introduced to the patient, to step over and politely acknowledge 
him or her. You do want to quickly establish rapport, as in any clinical encounter. 
 
 
406
Examination Medicine
Shaking hands is no longer recommended, in view of the COVID19 pandemic, and 
don ’ t forget hand hygiene. Always position the patient properly (e.g. at 45° for the 
cardiovascular examination or fl at for the abdominal examination) and make sure that 
he or she is appropriately undressed for the relevant examination. 
 It is always worthwhile taking a moment to stand back and look at the whole patient. 
Th is may prevent you from missing an obvious spot diagnosis, such as myxoedema, a 
thymectomy scar in a patient with muscle weakness (myasthenia), muscle fasciculations 
in motor neurone disease, a psoriatic rash in a patient with arthropathy or a Cushingoid 
appearance in a hypertension examination. Practice really does help improve ability to 
see clinical associations. A candidate will almost always fail the case if a major sign is 
missed. Th e examiners decide what signs they feel are most important and, in practice, 
fi nding the majority of the agreed signs will result in a pass. 
 Approach to the patient 
 Do not ask the patient any questions about the diagnosis, but it is essential to say, ‘Let 
me know if this is uncomfortable or if I hurt you’, and, when examining the abdomen 
directly, to ask, ‘Are you tender anywhere?’ Th is is a test of bedside manner (and may 
give you a clue). Always try to make the patient comfortable and avoid totally exposing 
the patient or exposing parts that are not being examined. Look at the patient ’ s face 
intermittently, particularly during the abdominal and hand examination, for signs that 
he or she is uncomfortable. It is distressing for the examiners to see from the patient ’ s 
face that he or she is in pain and that the candidate is unaware of this or is ignoring it. 
 Blood pressure 
 Th e examiners do ask the candidate to take the patient ’ s blood pressure as part of the 
cardiovascular examination. In the past the measurement was often provided when the 
candidate asked, ‘Do you want me to take the blood pressure?’ or said, ‘I would now 
normally take the blood pressure’. Th is is not as simple as it sounds and many candidates 
can have considerable diffi  culty with this. In examinations, some candidates have looked 
shocked when told to go ahead and do what they had just off ered to do; others struggled 
with an unfamiliar sphygmomanometer, while others looked as though they did not 
really know how to measure blood pressure. 
 HINT 
 Practise taking the blood pressure accurately under exam-type conditions, and be prepared 
to do so in your case. It may be worth bringing your own portable sphygmomanometer. 
 Candidates often worry about the need to look for radiofemoral delay when they are 
asked to do a cardiovascular case. Th is is not necessary unless the introduction mentioned 
hypertension (or you fi nd hypertension when taking the blood pressure). 
 Performance 
 Remember that you are, in fact, demonstrating the signs (particularly in the case of a 
neurological short case) to the examiners. It is important to perform each manoeuvre 
 
 
407
15 • The short case
accurately and deliberately. Be seen to be smooth and confi dent, as if you have done the 
examination a thousand times before. Perform a thorough examination on patients you 
see during your routine clinical care – remember, practising for the clinical examination 
will make you a much better physician! Also, try to be confi dent of each sign before 
moving on to another area (e.g. on fi nding an abdominal mass, concentrate on exclud-
ing the various possibilities and coming to a fi rm conclusion), and do not worry too 
much about the time it takes. Practice will facilitate formation of conclusions accurately 
and quickly. 
 Very occasionally, the examiners will pull a candidate away in the middle of an 
examination. Th is is why it is important to synthesise the data as you go. Do not get 
fl ustered by this – it usually means that enough of the examination has been completed 
for you to have discovered the important signs. Examiners do not ask for the interpretation 
of a particular sign in isolation (e.g. the collapsing carotid pulse in aortic regurgitation 
or the double apex beat in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). 
 Th ere may not be time to complete a complicated examination, particularly in a 
neurology case. A good candidate will tailor the examination so that nothing really 
important is left out by the end of the time available. 
 Usually there is no interruption until the examination is almost fi nished. We suggest 
that candidates keep on examining until told to stop, and then give a short list of 
the other steps they would like to have completed and why (e.g. urine analysis, rectal 
examination). 
 One of the examiners’ worst nightmares is the candidate who rushes through an examination 
and fi nishes in 3 or 4 minutes. Th is means the examination has not been thorough and leaves 
12 minutes for discussion – this time can be very diffi  cult to fi ll (not good!). 
 Presentation 
 Before presenting the fi ndings, listen closely to the examiners’ instructions. Candidates 
will often be asked: ‘What did you fi nd?’ – at which point they are expected to describe 
the relevant signs fi rst and then comment on possible causes. Sometimes candidates will 
be asked: ‘What is your diagnosis?’ – at which point they are expected to give a diagnosis 
or diff erential diagnosis fi rst and then list the signs supporting the contention. 
 HINT 
 Formulate your diagnosis and differential diagnosis  based on the individual in front 
of you . 
 Using a formulaic presentation of your fi ndings might give you more time to think, 
but can be intensely irritating for the examiner if this is the fourth time they have heard 
‘Mr Smith is an elderly man lying comfortably in bed’, and especially if the patient is 
no older than the examiners and is obviously breathless and not comfortable. 
 One useful method of presentation is to fi rst repeat the examiners’ introduction 
briefl y, and then give the relevant fi ndings, followed by the provisional diagnosis. For 
example: ‘I was asked to examine Mr Jones, a 60-year-old man who has had problems 
with dyspnoea. On examination of his cardiovascular system, I found …’ When describ-
ing the signs it is probably easiest to present them in the order they were looked for 
(e.g. for the cardiovascular system – pulse rate, then blood pressure, then jugular venous 
pressure). It is important to state all the positive signs and the important negative ones.

Be defi nite about each sign mentioned, or do not mention the sign at all. Th ere is no 
place for expressions such as ‘slightly asymmetrical’ or ‘minor’. 
 HINT 
 In neurological examinations, don ’ t rush to undertake sensory testing, which is often 
frustrating and less reliable. Leave the sensory examination to the end if at all possible. 
 HINT 
 A redirect represents a genuine second chance – grab hold of the opportunity. There 
are no tricks in the examination. 
 Confi dence is critical to success in the short cases. Do not lose confi dence if you 
make a minor error; just continue – the examiners may not even have noticed. 
 A short diff erential diagnosis is usually expected, even if the diagnosis is obvious. For 
example, a patient with fasciculation plus upper and lower motor neurone signs in the 
legs and no sensory loss almost certainly has motor neurone disease, but a non-metastatic 
manifestation of carcinoma must be considered. Always mention common diseases 
before rare ones and always consider the patient ’ s age and sex. Never reel off  any old 
list; the diff erential diagnosis must be tailored to the particular patient. Sometimes 
patients will have signs of two diff erent problems. Th is should not be ignored. For 
example, a patient with proximal muscle weakness as a result of polymyositis may have 
unrelated Dupuytren ’ s contractures. 
 After presentation of the signs, a few minutes or more are set aside for discussion. 
Th e examiners are not encouraged to take the candidate back for a second look at a 
sign, as this can be extremely unsettling for the candidate and perhaps not fair. However, 
this does happen occasionally and it is best to think of it as a genuine second chance. 
 Understanding the role of the examiners 
 From the examiners’ point of view, the candidate who is completely wrong presents a 
problem. Th is can occur because he or she has not read the stem properly – for example, 
when a request to examine the lower cranial nerves leads a candidate to begin to test 
visual acuity. Sometimes the examination depends on a spot diagnosis. For example, 
for an obvious acromegalic patient the stem might be: ‘Th is man has noticed some 
changes in his hands. Have a look at his face, examine the hands and go on from there.’ 
Th e risk here is that the acromegaly is not recognised and the candidate decides the 
diagnosis is, say, rheumatoid arthritis. Th e examination and discussion will then have 
nothing to do with what the examiners had expected and prepared for. 
 If the candidate ’ s mistake is recognised early on, the examiners may attempt to redirect 
the examination. Th is can be surprisingly diffi  cult. Some candidates persist in continuing 
the way they began, despite strong hints or even direction from the examiners. Th is is 
presumably because they think an attempt is being made to trick them. Th is never happens. 
 HINT 
 If your diagnosis is completely incorrect, a good discussion won ’ t usually help you. 
 
 
409
15 • The short case
 Sometimes the examination seems to be going well and then the candidate comes 
out with a completely wrong diagnosis. Th is makes the examiners’ prepared discussion 
unusable. In this case the examiner will probably attempt to continue the discussion 
along the lines the candidate has begun. For example, the candidate appears to have 
examined a patient with small muscle wasting of the hands satisfactorily but then, against 
all the evidence, decides the problem is rheumatoid arthritis. Th e examiners may ask 
what was found that led to the diagnosis and were there any alternative possibilities, 
but if no alternatives can be extracted from the candidate then they will allow a discussion 
of rheumatoid arthritis. 
 Th is problem usually occurs when a candidate has decided on a diagnosis before 
looking at the patient. Deciding that because the stem was ‘ “examine the hands”, 
therefore this “can only rheumatoid” must be avoided. 
 One examiner will have introduced the patient and repeated the stem. Th is is likely 
to be the lead examiner. In many cases that examiner will conduct the discussion. Th ere 
may or may not be an opportunity for the other examiner to ask some questions at the 
end. Th is may be a sign that the fi rst one has run out of questions. Th is doesn ’ t really 
tell you whether things are going very well or very badly. 
 Investigations 
 Relevant X-rays or an ECG may be shown to the candidate. Some diagnostic and 
therapeutic aspects are likely to be discussed in the short case. If a candidate has done 
well in a case and there are a few minutes left for extra questions, the score can only 
improve. 
 HINT 
 If you have done well, in the last few minutes of discussion your score can only go up, 
not down. So don ’ t worry if the depth becomes overwhelming – press on talking about 
the problems in a mature, sensible fashion.

Examination Medicine
 Th e organising team are asked to fi nd a variety of cases for each candidate, but when 
a patient drops out or is rejected by the examiners these arrangements can go astray. 
One candidate got three cases of interstitial lung disease in her exam! However, all types 
still crop up and a candidate must try to prepare for most possibilities. It is also true 
that the more straightforward the case, the higher is the standard of examination that 
will be expected, and vice versa. Trick cases are deliberately avoided. 
 Understanding the examiners’ thinking 
 Th e value of some traditional clinical signs is now being questioned as  evidence-based 
approaches to clinical examination help establish the validity and utility of signs. Th ere 
is much work still to be done in this area, but an understanding of the value of signs 
is increasingly important. A tactful approach may be needed with the examiners to 
prevent any resentment at the candidate ’ s failing to look for a traditional sign that is a 
particular favourite of theirs. 
 Six golden rules for the short cases 
 1.  Do  everything properly when you examine the patient –  never take short cuts. 
 2.  Think and  synthesise as you examine the patient – be alert. 
 3.  Never make up signs and  never ignore signs because they don ’ t ﬁ t neatly together. 
 4.  Always  be sure of your facts when presenting – it ’ s better to say that you don ’ t know than to guess. 
 5.  Always show consideration for the patient and  never cause the patient pain. 
 6.  Wash your hands before and after the case.

 THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 
 The cardiovascular examination 
 HINT 
 Many candidates worry about where they should start the examination – with the hands 
or at the praecordium. It rarely matters, but if the instruction is to examine the chest 
you should do that ﬁ rst. Otherwise, you can start with the hands, but this must be done 
quickly and efﬁ ciently. Some candidates take so long on the periphery that they scarcely 
have time to examine the praecordium. 
 Common stems 
 There are not many unless the examiners feel particularly imaginative.
 1.  ‘This patient has been short of breath. Please examine him or her.’ (Consider any 
left-sided valvular lesion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), ventricular septal 
defect (VSD) or cardiac failure.) 
 2.  ‘This patient has been found to have a murmur on a pre-anaesthetic assessment. 
Please examine him or her.’ (This could be anything, but is not likely to be severe 
as the patient seems asymptomatic.) 
 3.  ‘This patient has hypertension. Please examine him or her.’ (Consider secondary 
causes of HT.) 
 4.  ‘This patient has peripheral oedema. Please examine him or her.’ (Consider right 
heart problems and congestive cardiac failure (CCF) – start at the legs.) 
 5.  ‘This patient has been unwell and had recurrent fever. Please examine him or her.’ 
(Suspect endocarditis.) 
 6.  ‘This patient has had a cardiac problem from infancy. Please examine him or her.’ 
(Try to remain calm in the face of congenital heart disease.) 
 7.  ‘This patient has been noticed to have some dysmorphic features. Please examine 
his or her cardiovascular system.’ (Look for Marfan ’ s, Down ’ s, Noonan ’ s, etc.) 
 8.  ‘Please examine this patient ’ s cardiovascular system’. This is increasingly the stem 
for asymptomatic cardiac cases. 
 Method ( Table 16.1 ) 
 1.  Make sure the patient is positioned at 45° and that his or her chest and neck are 
fully exposed. For a woman, the requirements of modesty dictate that you cover her 
breasts with a towel or loose garment. 
 2.  While standing back, inspect for the appearance of Marfan ’ s, Turner ’ s or Down 
syndrome. Also look for dyspnoea and cyanosis. It is also worth looking from a 
distance at the neck. Big  v waves are sometimes more obvious from a distance. 
 HINT 
 Struggling unsuccessfully with an unfamiliar blood pressure cuff looks very bad – especially 
when the incorrectly placed cuff crackles and then bursts as you inﬂ ate it. Practise 
taking the blood pressure quickly with different sphygmomanometers.

 Inspect the patient ’ s hands for clubbing. Demonstrate Schamroth ’ s sign ( Fig. 16.1 ) 
to the delight of the examiners. If there is no clubbing, opposition of the index

carefully, at each nail bed, otherwise it is easy to miss key signs. Note the presence of 
an intravenous cannula and, if an infusion is running, look at the bag to see what it is. 
Th ere will usually be a peripheral or central line in situ if the patient is being treated 
for infective endocarditis. Note any tendon xanthomata (type II hyperlipidaemia). 
 4.  Th e pulse at the wrist should be timed for rate and rhythm. Pulse character is poorly 
assessed here. Th is is also the time to feel for radiofemoral delay (which occurs in 
coarctation of the aorta) and radial–radial inequality.

 M Yanoff, J S Duker.  Ophthalmology , 3rd edn. Fig 12-9-18. Mosby, Elsevier, 2008, with permission. 
 HINT 
 Radiofemoral delay should be assessed very quickly or not at all, unless the stem 
suggests the patient has hypertension (or you ﬁ nd hypertension when taking the blood 
pressure). 
 5.  Next inspect the face. Look at the eyes briefl y for jaundice (valve haemolysis) and 
xanthelasma (type II or III hyperlipidaemia) ( Fig. 16.3 ). You may also notice the 
classic ‘mitral facies’ (due to dilatation of malar capillaries associated with severe 
mitral stenosis and caused by pulmonary hypertension and a low cardiac output). 
Th en inspect the mouth using a torch for a high-arched palate (Marfan ’ s syndrome 
and the possibility of aortic regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse), petechiae and 
the state of dentition (endocarditis). Look at the tongue or lips for central cyanosis. 
 6.  Th e neck is very important, so take time to examine here. Th e jugular venous pressure 
(JVP) must be assessed for height and character ( Table 16.2 and  Fig. 16.4 ). Use the right 
internal jugular vein to assess this. Look for a rise with inspiration (Kussmaul ’ s sign). 
 7.  Now feel each carotid pulse separately (never together). Assess the pulse character 
( Table 16.3 ). 
 8.  Proceed to the chest. Look  everywhere for scars. Previous mitral valvotomy may have 
been performed by a submammary or lateral thoracotomy approach. Th ese patients 
slowly redevelop mitral stenosis over many years. Inspect for deformity, the site of 
the apex beat and visible pulsations. Do not forget about pacemaker and cardioverter-
defi brillator boxes ( Figs 16.5 and  16.6 ).

 9.  Palpate for the apex beat position. Be seen to count down the correct number of 
intercostal spaces. Th e normal position is the fi fth intercostal space, 1 cm medial to 
the midclavicular line. Th e character of the apex beat is important. Th ere are a 
number of types:
 a.  A  pressure-loaded (hyperdynamic, systolic-overloaded) apex beat is a forceful and 
sustained impulse (e.g. in aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension). 
 b.  A  volume-loaded (hyperkinetic, diastolic-overloaded) apex beat is a forceful but 
unsustained impulse (e.g. in aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation). 
 Don ’ t miss the tapping apex beat of mitral stenosis (a palpable fi rst heart sound) 
or the dyskinetic apex beat caused by a previous large myocardial infarction. Th e 
double or triple apical impulse in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is very important 
too. Feel also for an apical thrill and time it. 
 10.  Palpate with the heel of your hand for a left parasternal impulse, which indicates 
right ventricular hypertrophy or left atrial enlargement. Now feel at the base of the 
heart for a palpable pulmonary component of the second heart sound (P2) and 
aortic thrills. Percussion is usually unnecessary. 
 11.  Auscultation begins with listening in the mitral area with both the bell and the 
diaphragm. Spend most time here. Listen for each component of the cardiac cycle 
separately. Identify the fi rst and second heart sounds ( Table 16.4 ) and decide whether 
they are of normal intensity and whether they are split. Now listen for extra heart

valves include bileafl et, ball case and tilting disc. Ball case valves have a sharp opening 
sound and may rattle. Tilting disc valves have soft opening sounds and sharp closing 
sounds. All mechanical valves require anticoagulation. Biological valves may have a 
systolic murmur; anticoagulation is not required. Do not be satisfi ed at having 
identifi ed one abnormality. However, remember that it is quite common to get 
simple rather than complex lesions in the examination.

Th e Valsalva manoeuvre should be performed whenever there is a systolic murmur, 
otherwise hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is easily missed ( p. 433 ). 
 HINT 
 A patient who seems familiar with the Valsalva manoeuvre may well have a murmur 
affected by it. 
 15.  Th e patient is now sitting up. Percuss the back quickly to exclude a pleural eff usion 
(e.g. due to left ventricular failure) and auscultate for inspiratory crackles (indicate 
left ventricular failure). If there is radiofemoral delay, also listen for a coarctation 
murmur here. Feel for sacral oedema and note any back deformity (e.g. ankylosing 
spondylitis ( p. 513 ) with aortic regurgitation). 
 16.  Next lay the patient fl at and examine the abdomen properly ( p. 460 ) for hepatomegaly 
(e.g. as a result of right ventricular failure) and a pulsatile liver (a reliable sign of 
tricuspid regurgitation). Perform the abdominojugular refl ux test. Press over the 
upper abdomen for 10 seconds or so and watch for a rise in the JVP (abnormal 
if  > 4 cm elevation for the duration of compression). Th is is a reliable sign of 
heart failure. Feel for splenomegaly (endocarditis) and an aortic aneurysm. Palpate

 Notes 
 1.  It is fairly unlikely that you will have time to complete all aspects of your examination. 
If you are stopped, mention the list of things you would still like to do that are 
particularly relevant. 
 2.  If you have auscultated and there is nothing obvious at fi rst, consider the following 
and exclude them:
 a.  mitral stenosis ( Fig. 16.9 ) (position and exercise if necessary) 
 b.  atrial septal defect (ASD) (listen carefully for fi xed splitting) 
 c.  mitral valve prolapse (perform a Valsalva manoeuvre) 
 d.  pulmonary hypertension (see below) 
 e.  constrictive pericarditis. 
 Notes on valve diseases 
 After you have made a diagnosis of a valve lesion, the following are the types of facts 
you should know. An assessment of the lesion ’ s severity is usually required. 
 Candidates should be able to make some recommendation as to appropriate follow-up. 
Most patients with valve abnormalities should be reviewed regularly and have repeat 
echocardiograms. For patients with mild abnormalities about every 3–4 years is suffi  cient, 
but for more severe cases an annual review is usually recommended. Patients who are

Examination Medicine
 Echocardiograph (M mode, two-dimensional (2D) Doppler and 
colour flow mapping) 
 Th e posterior mitral leafl et maintains its anterior position in diastole and this is pathog-
nomonic. On 2D scanning the valve can be seen doming in diastole. Th e mitral valve 
area can be quite accurately determined by 2D echocardiography and Doppler measure-
ments. Th e valve area is estimated using the pressure half-time measurement. Th is 
analysis of Doppler left ventricular infl ow is performed routinely when mitral stenosis 
is suspected. Colour fl ow mapping makes fi nding the infl ow jet easier and is very sensitive 
for the detection of any associated mitral regurgitation. 
 INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY 
 Exertional dyspnoea and falling valve area (when the valve area falls to about 1 cm 2 ) 
with signs of increasing right heart pressures are the usual indications for surgery. It 
should usually be performed before pulmonary oedema or major haemoptysis has occurred 
(when the valve area falls to about 1 cm 2 ).

 HINT 
 A declaration that the apex beat is ‘tapping’ in quality tells the examiner that you have 
made the diagnosis of mitral (or very rarely tricuspid) stenosis. It is unwise to allow 
the word ‘tapping’ to escape your lips unless you are happy that this is the diagnosis. 
 Mitral regurgitation 
 CAUSES – CHRONIC 
 1.  Degenerative disease. 
 2.  Mitral valve prolapse. 
 3.  Rheumatic (men more often than women) – rarely is mitral regurgitation the only 
murmur present. 
 4.  Papillary muscle dysfunction:
 a.  left ventricular failure 
 b.  ischaemia. 
 5.  Connective tissue disease – rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis. 
 6.  Congenital – endocardial cushion defect (including primum atrial septal defect and 
cleft mitral leafl et), parachute valve, corrected transposition. 
 CAUSES – ACUTE 
 1.  Infective endocarditis (perforation of anterior leafl et), rupture of a myxomatous cord. 
 2.  Myocardial infarction (chordae rupture or papillary muscle dysfunction). 
 3.  Trauma 
 CLINICAL SIGNS OF SEVERITY

aetiology, the severity and any associated valve or structural abnormalities:

 b.  prolapsing leafl et(s) 
 c.  left atrial size (a sign of chronicity and severity) 
 d.  left ventricular size and function (chronic MR cannot really be severe if the LV is 
not dilated) 
 e.  Doppler detection of the regurgitant jet in the left atrium; colour mapping of jet 
size and detection of reversal of fl ow in the pulmonary veins. Width of the vena

ASD associated with mitral valve prolapse) 
 g.  calcifi cation of the mitral annulus – common in elderly people.  Note: the valve 
leafl ets may not appear abnormal. 
 h.  Stress echocardiography may show a failure of the ejection fraction to increase 
during exercise (contractile reserve) in patients with severe MR. 
 INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY 
 In chronic mitral regurgitation, consider surgery if there are class III or IV symptoms, 
or if there is left ventricular dysfunction or the left ventricular dimensions have increased 
progressively. In acute mitral regurgitation, operate if there is haemodynamic collapse 
(there usually is). Repair of a prolapsing posterior and often anterior leafl et is now 
undertaken earlier than valve replacement. Th e short- and long-term results (1% recurrence 
per year) are so good that the operation should be recommended for even mild symptoms 
or once left ventricular dilatation occurs. Mitral valve replacement is usually with a 
mechanical valve. Tissue valves in the mitral position have a relatively short life (sometimes 
only 5–7 years). 
 Mitral valve prolapse (systolic click–murmur syndrome) 
 Th is is the most common heart lesion in the community (3% of adults) and is more 
common in women. When it occurs in men, it is more likely to progress to cause signifi cant 
regurgitation.

Conclusions

Comment
The echocardiography criteria for MVP have been tightened over the last several years. 
Redundancy of one or both of the MV leaflets is common and probably represents a variation 
of normal in many cases. Bowing of the leaflet into the left atrium of at least 1 cm must be 
present before the diagnosis of MVP can be made. In this case, the posterior leaflet appears 
very abnormal and seems to move into the left atrium in an unrestrained fashion. This 
suggests its chordal attachment may have been severed. The chords may be involved in the 
abnormality of the mitral leaflets in patients with prolapse and are at risk of rupture.
The left ventricle is dilated, suggesting that the mitral regurgitation is of haemodynamic 
significance. Left ventricular ejection remains high in cases of mitral regurgitation until late 
in the illness. This is because the left ventricular afterload is low. Part of the left ventricular 
ejection is into the left atrium, which is a low-resistance chamber.
The left atrial enlargement, present here, suggests that some mitral regurgitation has been 
present for some time. A large left atrium pleases the cardiac surgeons who have trouble 
getting their hands into the mitral valve through a normal-sized atrium.

 DYNAMIC AUSCULTATION 
 Th e click murmur is aff ected by the:
 1.  Valsalva manoeuvre (decreases preload) – murmur longer, click earlier 
 2.  handgrip (increases afterload) or squatting (increases preload) – murmur shorter. 
 ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY 
 Th ere is now thought to be a considerable variation in the normal range of the appearance 
of the mitral leafl ets on echocardiography. Some redundancy of one or both leafl ets is 
commonly seen in normal people. Prolapse of a leafl et of 1 cm or more into the left 
atrium behind the attachment point of the valve is considered abnormal. Antibiotic 
prophylaxis, however, is not necessary for these patients unless mitral regurgitation is 
detected on Doppler interrogation.

 CHOICE OF VALVE 
 Tissue (bovine pericardial or porcine, or occasionally homograft) valves are usually 
off ered to patients over the age of about 65 or to younger patients who wish to avoid 
warfarin. Th eir life expectancy before failing is up to 15 years or more. Transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly used not only for patients too frail for 
surgery but for lower risk patients. Th is is a tissue valve. 
 Tricuspid regurgitation 
 Look for the following signs:
 1.  the JVP – large  v waves: the JVP is elevated if right ventricular failure has occurred 
 2.  palpation – right ventricular heave 
 3.  auscultation – a pansystolic murmur, maximal at the lower end of the sternum and 
on inspiration, may be present, but the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the 
peripheral signs alone; multiple systolic clicks are characteristic of Ebstein ’ s anomaly 
of the tricuspid valve 
 4.  abdomen – a pulsatile, large and tender liver is usually present; ascites and oedema 
with pleural eff usions may also occur.

Comments
This echocardiography report gives considerable information about the patient’s murmur. 
A candidate who had not diagnosed AS would be in some difficulty.
In AS the aortic valve is usually thickened and calcified unless the patient is young 
and has congenital AS. Stenosed aortic valves are often congenitally bicuspid and so the 
echocardiographer will often report the number of valve leaflets. Sometimes there is a 
comment about reduction in valve cusp movement. An almost immobile valve is more likely 
to be severely stenosed.
LVH is common when AS is significant. This LVH is mild; dimensions of 14 mm or more 
indicate severe LVH. Left ventricular dilatation and reduced fractional shortening are late signs.
Doppler measurement of the velocity of blood in the ascending aorta in systole allows 
calculation of the peak pressure difference across the valve (usually almost 0). This gradient 
tends to be higher than the gradient measured at cardiac catheterisation. The mean gradient 
is often closer to the catheter gradient.
Some AR is very often detected in the presence of significant AS. It is unlikely this mild AR 
would be audible and its presence on the report should not lead the candidate to panic.

 CAUSES 
 1.  Functional (no disease of the valve leafl ets) – right ventricular failure. 
 2.  Rheumatic – only very rarely does tricuspid regurgitation occur alone; usually mitral 
valve disease is also present. 
 3.  Infective endocarditis (right-sided endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers). 
 4.  Congenital – Ebstein ’ s anomaly. 
 5.  Tricuspid valve prolapse (rare). 
 6.  Right ventricular papillary muscle infarction. 
 7.  Pacemaker or defi brillator lead. 
 8.  Trauma (usually a steering-wheel injury to the sternum). 
 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS 
 Th e chest X-ray fi lm may show right ventricular enlargement or biventricular enlargement 
if the tricuspid regurgitation is secondary to heart failure. Patients with Ebstein ’ s anomaly 
may have the characteristic box-shaped heart and narrow cardiac base ( Fig. 16.14 ). 
Echocardiography enables detection of structural valve abnormality and estimation of

the size of the regurgitant jet in the right atrium. Measurement of the velocity of this 
jet allows estimation of the pressure gradient across the valve. As right atrial pressure is 
usually 5–10 mmHg, the right ventricular pressure can be estimated in any patient with 
tricuspid regurgitation by adding 5 to this pressure gradient. Trivial tricuspid regurgitation 
is a common and normal Doppler echocardiogram fi nding. 
 Pulmonary stenosis (in adults) 
 Look for the following signs:
 1.  General signs:
 a.  peripheral cyanosis because of a low cardiac output 
 b.  the pulse – normal or reduced because of a low cardiac output 
 c.  the JVP – giant  a waves because of right atrial hypertrophy; the JVP may be 
elevated 
 d.  palpation – right ventricular heave; thrill over the pulmonary area (common) 
 e.  auscultation – the murmur may be preceded by an ejection click; a harsh ejection 
systolic murmur maximal in the pulmonary area and on inspiration is present; S4 
may be present (owing to right atrial hypertrophy) 
 f.  abdomen – presystolic pulsation of the liver may be present 
 2.  Signs of severe pulmonary stenosis:
 a.  an ejection systolic murmur peaking late in systole 
 b.  absence of an ejection click (also absent when the pulmonary stenosis is infundibular, 
i.e. below the valve level) 
 c.  presence of S4 
 d.  signs of right ventricular failure. 
 CAUSES 
 1.  Congenital. 
 2.  Carcinoid syndrome. 
 Chronic constrictive pericarditis 
 Th is is a diffi  cult diagnosis; the clue is often that the patient appears cachectic and has 
ascites. Look for the following signs:
 1.  pulse and blood pressure – a low blood pressure and pulsus paradoxus are typical 
 2.  JVP – this is raised; Kussmaul ’ s sign is rare; the  x and  y descents are prominent 
 3.  apex beat – impalpable 
 4.  heart sounds – these are distant; there may be an early third heart sound and an early 
pericardial knock (as rapid ventricular fi lling is abruptly halted) 
 5.  hepatosplenomegaly, ascites and oedema provide important clues 
 6.  underlying aetiology (e.g. radiation, tumour, pericarditis after cardiac surgery (scar 
present), tuberculosis, connective tissue disease, chronic renal failure, trauma). 
 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
 It is always important to consider this diagnosis – it is a popular ‘trap’! Th e classical 
signs are as follows:
 1.  Pulse – this is typically sharp, rising and jerky, owing to rapid ejection by a hypertrophied 
ventricle early in systole, then followed by obstruction; it is not like the pulse of AS. 
 2.  Th e JVP – there is a prominent  a wave owing to forceful atrial contraction against 
a non-compliant ventricle. 
 3.  Apex beat – there is typically a double or triple impulse owing to presystolic ventricular 
expansion following atrial contraction.

 4.  Auscultation:
 a.  late systolic ejection murmur (left sternal edge) 
 b.  pansystolic murmur (apex) from mitral regurgitation 
 c.  fourth heart sound. 
 Note: Th ere are no diastolic murmurs. 
 5.  Dynamic manoeuvres – the murmur is louder with the Valsalva manoeuvre, standing 
and isotonic exercise (e.g. jogging – not usually possible under examination conditions). 
Th e murmur is softer with squatting, raising the legs and isometric exercise (e.g. 
forceful handgrip). 
 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

 a.  left ventricular hypertrophy and lateral ST segment and T wave changes 
 b.  deep Q waves 
 c.  conduction defects. 
 2.  Chest X-ray fi lm:
 a.  left ventricle enlarged with a hump along the border 
 b.  no valve calcifi cation. 
 3.  Echocardiography ( Fig. 16.15 ):

 b.  systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral valve leafl et 
 c.  midsystolic closure of the aortic valve 
 d.  Doppler detection of mitral regurgitation 
 e.  Doppler estimation of the gradient in the left ventricular outfl ow tract (at rest and

 Non-cyanotic congenital heart disease 
 Th ese are diffi  cult examination cases that not infrequently crop up in the test. 
 ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 
 Th ere are two types (sinus venosus defects are not often seen in adults): ostium secundum 
and ostium primum. 
 ASD: ostium secundum 
 Th is is the most common and presents in adult life with:
 1.  fi xed splitting of the second heart sound ( Note: Unfortunately, an ASD is still a 
possible diagnosis when some variation in splitting is detectable during the respiratory

Conclusions
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with LVOT gradient of 80 mmHg. Systolic anterior motion of 
anterior mitral valve leaflet. Moderate MR.
Comment
The typical echocardiograph findings in this condition are seen here. The septum is thicker 
than 11 mm and there is abnormal anterior movement of the anterior mitral valve leaflet 
in systole – SAM. This movement is, in part, responsible for any LVOT gradient. The LVOT 
gradient only correlates roughly with symptoms and prognosis in this condition. In some 
cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy there may be no LVOT gradient.

 a.  paradoxical septal motion, right ventricular dilatation 
 b.  echo dropout in atrial septum 
 c.  Doppler detection of a shunt at the atrial level 
 d.  shunt (bubble) study using agitated saline 
 e.  transoesophageal echocardiogram. 
 Indication for surgery 
 Almost all ASDs need to be closed once RV dilatation has occurred. Th is can be done 
surgically or, if they are suitable, with a percutaneous closure device. A left-to-right shunt 
is measured to be at least 1.5 to 1 (unless there is reversal of the shunt) and is also an 
indication for closure. A nuclear cardiac shunt study may help estimation of the shunt size. 
 ASD: ostium primum 
 Th is is an endocardial cushion defect adjacent to the atrioventricular valves. Th e signs 
are the same as for ostium secundum, but associated mitral regurgitation, tricuspid 
 
 
437
16 • Common short cases
regurgitation or VSD is common. Th e ECG is particularly helpful as there is left axis 
deviation and right bundle branch block (and sometimes a prolonged P–R interval). 
Look also for the presence of Down syndrome and skeletal upper limb defects (Holt–Oram 
syndrome). 
 VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT 
 Th e clues to the diagnosis of VSD are a thrill and a harsh pansystolic murmur confi ned 
to the left sternal edge. Sometimes mitral regurgitation is also present. Down syndrome 
is associated. 
 Results of investigations 
 Th e ECG and chest X-ray fi lm may show left ventricular hypertrophy. Th e chest X-ray 
fi lm may also show increased pulmonary vasculature and an enlarged right ventricle. 
Th e echocardiogram will show the defect and detect the shunt. Estimation of the pressure 
gradient between the ventricles will allow detection of right ventricular hypertension. 
As right ventricular pressure rises, the gradient across the defect falls (right ventricular 
pressure is closer to left ventricular) – a sign that the shunt is causing trouble. 
 Indication for percutaneous closure or surgery 
 Closure is indicated when the left-to-right shunt is moderate to large, with the pulmonary-
to-systemic fl ow being  > 1.5 to 1. Often the presence of right ventricular dilatation is 
taken as a sign that the shunt is large. 
 PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS 
 In patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) there is a vessel from the bifurcation of the pulmonary 
artery to the aorta. Th e shunt is usually from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Reversal 
of the shunt leads to diff erential cyanosis and clubbing (of toes,  not fi ngers). Often a 
continuous murmur is heard. Confusion with aortic stenosis and regurgitation commonly 
occurs when candidates examine these patients. 
 Results of investigations 
 1.  Th e ECG may show left ventricular hypertrophy (diastolic overload). 
 2.  Th e chest X-ray fi lm may show:
 a.  increased pulmonary vasculature 
 b.  calcifi cation of the duct (trumpet-shaped calcifi cation) 
 c.  an enlarged left ventricle. 
 3.  Doppler echocardiography will demonstrate continuous fl ow in the main pulmonary 
artery. Left atrial size will be increased. 
 Indication for surgery 
 Th e indication for surgery or use of a closure device (surgery for this condition in adults is 
diffi  cult and is now largely replaced by the use of percutaneous catheter closure devices) is the 
diagnosis of PDA with more than a trivial shunt (unless there is pulmonary hypertension). 
 HINT 
 The detection of a trivial shunt at echocardiography in a patient with a PDA but without 
a signiﬁ cant murmur or any symptoms is not an indication for closure. 
 
 
438
Examination Medicine
 COARCTATION OF THE AORTA 
 Th e most common site for this lesion is just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. 
Look for a better-developed upper body, radiofemoral delay, hypertension in the arms 
only, chest collateral vessels, a midsystolic murmur over the praecordium and back, and 
changes of hypertension in the fundi. Turner ’ s syndrome may be associated in some cases. 
 Results of investigations 
 1.  Th e ECG may show left ventricular hypertrophy (systolic overload). 
 2.  Th e chest X-ray fi lm ( Fig. 16.17 ) may show:
 a.  enlarged left ventricle 
 b.  enlarged left subclavian artery 
 c.  dilated ascending aorta 
 d.  aortic indentation 
 e.  aortic prestenotic and poststenotic dilatation 
 f.  rib notching – second to sixth ribs on the inferior border.

 a.  left ventricular hypertrophy 
 b.  coarctation shelf in the descending aorta 
 c.  abnormal fl ow patterns in the same area.

16 • Common short cases
 Cyanotic congenital heart disease 
 Th is is a very diffi  cult area. You probably will not be expected to identify the exact 
lesion. A cardiac cause should be suspected if the patient shows clubbing and cyanosis. 
 Th e common causes of the problem in adults are:
 1.  Eisenmenger ’ s syndrome (see  Fig. 16.18 ) – pulmonary hypertension plus a large 
communication between the left and right circulations (e.g. VSD, PDA, ASD) 
 2.  tetralogy of Fallot 
 3.  complex lesions – univentricular heart, Ebstein ’ s anomaly (if there is an associated 
atrial septal defect with a right-to-left shunt). 
 You must decide while examining the patient whether pulmonary hypertension is 
present, as this distinguishes Eisenmenger ’ s syndrome from the tetralogy of Fallot. 
 EISENMENGER ’ S SYNDROME 
 Th is syndrome may be found in older adults who had right-to-left shunting before the 
availability of open-heart surgery. Th e physical signs may include cyanosis, clubbing and 
polycythaemia. Th e JVP pattern may have a dominant  a wave and sometimes a prominent 
 v wave. A right ventricular heave and a palpable pulmonary component of the second heart 
sound (P2) may be found. On auscultation the S2 is normally single – there is persistent 
synchrony of A2 and P2. A fourth heart sound, a pulmonary ejection click, pulmonary 
regurgitation and, sometimes, tricuspid regurgitation may be present (but there may be 
no murmurs). Th e signs all add up to pulmonary hypertension in a cyanosed patient.

 Results of investigations 
 1.  Th e ECG may show:
 a.  right ventricular hypertrophy 
 b.  P pulmonale. 
 2.  Th e chest X-ray fi lm ( Fig. 16.18 ) may show:
 a.  right ventricular and right atrial enlargement 
 b.  pulmonary artery prominence

 d.  a heart that is  not boot shaped. 
 3.  Echocardiography will defi ne the anatomy and enable measurement of pulmonary 
pressures. 
 TETRALOGY OF FALLOT 
 Th ere are four features:
 1.  VSD 
 2.  right ventricular outfl ow obstruction (which determines severity) 
 3.  overriding aorta 
 4.  right ventricular hypertrophy. 
 Th e physical signs may include cyanosis, clubbing, polycythaemia, a right ventricular 
heave and a thrill at the left sternal edge, but  not cardiomegaly. On auscultation there 
may be a single second heart sound (A2) and a short pulmonary ejection murmur. 
 Results of investigations 
 1.  Th e ECG may show:
 a.  right ventricular hypertrophy 
 b.  right axis deviation. 
 2.  Th e chest X-ray fi lm ( Fig. 16.19 ) may show:
 a.  a normal-sized heart with a boot shape (i.e. a left concavity where the pulmonary 
artery is normally situated plus a prominent elevated apex) 
 b.  right ventricular enlargement 
 c.  decreased vascularity of lung vessels 
 d.  right-sided aortic knob, arch and descending aorta (25%). 
 3.  Echocardiography will demonstrate the anatomical abnormalities. 
 The hypertensive examination 
 HINT 
 Despite traditional teaching, a loud P2 has little correlation with the presence of pulmonary 
hypertension, but a palpable P2 correlates well. It is said that a loud P2 is more a sign 
that a patient is thin than of anything else.

16 • Common short cases
 Method 
 1.  Stand back and inspect the patient. Look for evidence of Cushing ’ s syndrome, 
acromegaly, polycythaemia and uraemia ( Table 16.6 ). If one of these is present, modify 
your examination appropriately. 
 2.  Next, confi rm that the blood pressure is elevated. Ask to measure it in both arms, 
and with the patient both lying and standing. Measurement in the legs in a young 
patient may be important. 
 3.  Feel the radial pulse and very carefully feel for radiofemoral delay. Palpate for radial–radial 
asymmetry and inspect both hands for vasculitic changes. 
 4.  Now look at the face. Inspect the conjunctivae for injection (polycythaemia), and 
then examine the fundi for hypertensive changes ( Fig. 16.20 ). Describe what you see 
when presenting, rather than just giving a grade ( Table 16.7 ). 
 5.  Examine the rest of the cardiovascular system, looking especially for left ventricular 
failure and coarctation of the aorta. Usually a fourth heart sound is present in severe 
hypertension. 
 6.  Th e abdomen should be examined for renal masses, adrenal masses and an abdomi-
nal aneurysm. Auscultate for renal bruits (as a result of fi bromuscular dysplasia or 
atheroma). Th ese may have a diastolic component. Listen fi rst just to the right or left 
of the midline above the umbilicus. Th en sit the patient up and listen in the fl anks 
(a systolic–diastolic bruit in the costovertebral area suggests a renal arteriovenous 
fi stula). 
 7.  At the end, ask for the results of urine analysis (signs of renal disease). Also, remember 
that cerebrovascular accidents secondary to hypertension may cause other physical 
signs.

 Common stem 
 ‘This 37-year-old man has a heart murmur. Please examine him.’ 
 Method 
 Fortunately, you notice a Marfanoid habitus.
 1.  While performing your normal cardiovascular examination, look also for the following 
signs (and when reporting allude to the diagnostic criteria).
 a.  Hands and arms: look for arachnodactyly (spider fi ngers) and joint hypermobility, 
as well as long, thin limbs. 
 b.  Face : you may notice a long and narrow face. Look for lens dislocation or lens 
replacement. Th e sclerae may be blue. Look in the mouth for a high-arched palate. 
 c.  Chest : note any pectus carinatum or excavatum. 
 d.  Heart: auscultate for aortic regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse. Also, look for 
the signs of dissecting aneurysm or coarctation of the aorta. 
 e.  Back: look for kyphoscoliosis and hypermobility. 
 2.  At the end, always ask to measure the arm span, which will exceed the height. Th e 
upper segment to lower segment ratio will be less than 0.85 (the upper segment is 
from the crown to the symphysis pubis and the lower segment is from the symphysis 
pubis to the ground). 
 Investigations 
 1.  Many of these patients will have had serial echocardiograms because the detection 
of progressive aortic root dilatation will warn of an increased risk of dissection before 
this occurs. 
 2.  A slit-lamp examination may be required to diagnose lens dislocation. 
 Oedema 
 Common stem 
 ‘This man has oedema. Please assess him.’ 
 
 
444
Examination Medicine
 Method 
 1.  First, stand back and look at the patient. Are there any clues if this is a cardiac, renal, 
liver or nutrition case? 
 2.  Note whether the oedema is localised or generalised and whether it is gravitational 
or not. 
 3.  Assess nutrition quickly (as hypoalbuminaemia and also beri beri due to vitamin B 1 
defi ciency 1 can cause oedema). Also, any obvious signs of myxoedema must never 
be missed. 
 4.  If necessary, ask the patient to undress as appropriate and then further defi ne the 
areas aff ected. Palpate for pitting. Proceed, depending on your fi ndings ( Table 16.8 ). 
 PITTING LOWER LIMB OEDEMA 
 1.  Defi ne the extent of the oedema. 
 2.  Look for signs of DVT (2 cm diff erence in calf swelling, prominent superfi cial veins 
and increased warmth have minor diagnostic value; Homans’ sign is unhelpful). Note 
the presence of varicose veins (a common cause of mild peripheral oedema) and of 
vein-harvesting scars (for coronary artery surgery). 
 3.  Feel the inguinal nodes. Go to the abdomen and look for abdominal wall oedema, 
prominent abdominal wall veins (inferior vena caval obstruction), ascites, any abdominal 
masses and evidence of liver disease. A pulsatile liver (tricuspid regurgitation) or 
malignant involvement should be particularly sought. 
 4.  Next, examine the JVP. Th en examine for signs of right ventricular failure and constrictive 
pericarditis. Feel all the node groups. 
 5.  Finally, examine for delayed ankle jerks (to exclude hypothyroidism) and look at the 
urine analysis. Remember that vasodilating drugs used for hypertension or angina 
are very common causes of oedema. 
 NON-PITTING LOWER LIMB OEDEMA 
 Consider the various causes, including lymphoedema (from malignant infi ltration, 
congenital disease, fi lariasis, Milroy ’ s disease) and myxoedema. 
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVAL OBSTRUCTION ( TABLE 16.9 ,  FIG. 16.21 ) 
 1.  Th e patient may appear Cushingoid, from either a tumour or treatment with steroids. 
Note the plethoric cyanosed face with periorbital oedema. Th ere may be exophthalmos 
and conjunctival injection. 
 2.  Examine the pupils: a mass in the chest may have caused Horner ’ s syndrome. 
 Table 16.8   Causes of oedema 
 1.  Drugs – calcium channel blockers 
 2.  Cardiac – congestive cardiac failure, cor pulmonale, constrictive pericarditis 
 3.  Renal – nephrotic syndrome (see  Table 11.6 ,  p. 315 ) 
 4.  Hepatic – cirrhosis 
 5.  Malabsorption or starvation 
 6.  Protein-losing enteropathy 
 7.  Myxoedema

 3.  Examine the fundi for venous dilatation. Examine the neck, which is enlarged. Th e 
JVP is raised, but the vein is not pulsatile. 
 4.  Decide whether the thyroid gland is enlarged. Check Pemberton ’ s sign (see  Fig. 16.42 ). 
 5.  Feel for supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and listen over the trachea for inspiratory 
stridor. 
 6.  Examine the chest carefully for distended venous collaterals. 
 7.  One or both arms may be oedematous. 
 8.  Look for all the peripheral manifestations of lung carcinoma.

 3.  ‘This man has had haemoptysis, Please examine him.’ 
 
 
446
Examination Medicine
 Method ( Table 16.10 ) 
 1.  If necessary, ask the patient to undress to the waist and sit over the side of the bed 
or on a chair. 
 2.  While standing back to make your usual inspection, ask whether sputum is available 
for you to look at. A large volume of purulent sputum is an important clue to 
bronchiectasis. Haemoptysis suggests lung carcinoma or pulmonary infection. Look 
for evidence of dyspnoea at rest and count the respiratory rate. Note the use of the 
accessory muscles of respiration and any intercostal indrawing of the lower ribs 
anteriorly (a sign of emphysema). General cachexia should also be noted. 
 3.  Pick up the patient ’ s hands. Note clubbing ( Table 16.11 ), peripheral cyanosis, nicotine 
(actually tar) staining and anaemia, and look for wasting of the small muscles of the 
hands and weakness of fi nger abduction (which may be caused by a lower trunk 
brachial plexus lesion from apical lung carcinoma involvement). Palpate the wrists 
for tenderness, but only if there is clubbing (hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy

 Note: Clubbing does  not occur with COPD, sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, coal worker ’ s pneumoconiosis

if in doubt. 
(HPOA), see  Fig. 16.27b and c ). While holding the patient ’ s hand, palpate the radial 
pulse for tachycardia or obvious pulsus paradoxus. 
 4.  Go on to the face. Look closely at the eyes for ptosis and constriction of the pupils 
(Horner ’ s syndrome,  p. 526 ). Inspect the tongue for central cyanosis. 
 5.  Palpate the position of the trachea. 
 6.  Note the presence of a tracheal tug, which indicates gross over-expansion of the chest 
with airfl ow obstruction. Ask the patient to cough and note whether this is a loose 
cough, a dry cough or, because of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, a bovine cough. 
 HINT 
 Always ask the patient to cough. 
 HINT 
 Before feeling the trachea, apologise and warn the patient that the examination may 
be uncomfortable. 
 7.  Next measure the forced expiratory time (FET). Tell the patient to take a maximal 
inspiration and blow out as rapidly and completely as possible. Note audible wheeze. 
Prolongation of expiration beyond 3 seconds is evidence of chronic airfl ow limitation. 
If you wish to impress the examiners use a peak fl ow meter – normal 600 L / min 
 
 
448
Examination Medicine
for young men and 400 L / min for women. Doing these two tests can appear very 
impressive, but it must look smooth and practised. 
 8.  Th e next step is to examine the chest. You may wish to examine this anteriorly fi rst 
or go around to the back. Th e advantage of the latter is that there are usually more 
signs there, unless the trachea is obviously displaced. 
 HINT 
 Deviation of the trachea is a most important sign, so spend time on it. If the trachea 
is displaced, concentrate on the upper lobes for physical signs. Upper lobe ﬁ brosis 
causes tracheal deviation to the same side. 
 9.  Inspect the back. Look for kyphoscoliosis. Do not miss ankylosing spondylitis 
( p. 513 ), which causes decreased chest expansion and occasionally upper lobe fi brosis. 
Look for thoracotomy scars and prominent veins. Also note any skin changes from 
radiotherapy. 
 HINT 
 A large thoracotomy scar in a patient who looks Cushingoid suggests the possibility of 
a lung transplant. A unilateral transplant may leave signs on the other side, such as 
the crackles of interstitial lung disease (ILD, pulmonary ﬁ brosis), whereas the side with 
the scar sounds normal. 
 10.  Palpate the cervical nodes from behind. Th en examine for expansion. First, upper 
lobe expansion is best seen by looking over the patient ’ s shoulders at clavicular 
movement during moderate respiration. Th e aff ected side will show a delay or decreased 
movement. Th en examine lower lobe expansion by palpation. Note any asymmetry 
and reduction of movement. 
 11.  Ask the patient to bring his or her elbows together in front of the body so as to move 
the scapulae out of the way. Examine for vocal fremitus. Th en percuss the back of 
the chest and include both axillae. Do not miss a pleural eff usion ( Table 16.12 ). 
 12.  Auscultate the chest. Note breath sounds (whether bronchial or vesicular) and their 
intensity (normal or reduced) ( Table 16.13 ). Listen for adventitial sounds (crackles 
and wheezes) ( Table 16.14 ). Finally, examine for vocal resonance. If a localised 
abnormality is found, try to determine the abnormal lobe and segment. 
 13.  Return to the front of the chest. Inspect again for chest deformity, symmetry of chest wall 
movement, distended veins, radiotherapy changes and scars. Palpate the supraclavicular 
nodes carefully. Palpate the apex beat and measure chest expansion. Th en test for vocal 
fremitus and proceed with percussion and auscultation as before. Listen high up in the 
axillae too. Before leaving the chest, feel the axillary nodes and breasts. 
 HINT 
 If chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) seems likely, test for Hoover ’ s sign: 
place your hands along the costal margins with your thumbs close to the xiphisternum. 
Normally inspiration causes your thumbs to separate, but the over-inﬂ ated chest of the

 Try to avoid ﬁ nishing the examination by saying to the examiners, ‘I now want to know 
the results of spirometry and pulse oximetry’, as this may cause irritation. 
 Table 16.14   Added sounds 
 WHEEZES (RHONCHI) 
Inspiratory wheezes – characteristic of asthma or upper airway extrathoracic obstruction 
 Expiratory wheezes – occur in asthma and COPD 
 Fixed inspiratory wheeze (monophonic – does not change with respiration) – an important sign of ﬁ xed 
bronchial obstruction, usually due to a carcinoma
 CRACKLES (CREPITATIONS) 
Late or pan inspiratory crackles: 
 • 
 ﬁ ne – caused by ﬁ brosis – dry crackles 
 • 
 medium – caused by left ventricular failure 
 • 
 coarse – caused by bronchiectasis or retained secretions 
Early inspiratory crackles: coarse – caused by COPD
 14.  Ask the patient to lie down at 45° and then visually measure the JVP. 
 15.  Examine the praecordium for signs of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. 
Finally, examine the liver and look for peripheral oedema. Check for Pemberton ’ s 
sign (see  Fig. 16.42 ). 
 16.  Before leaving the patient, ask whether you may see the temperature chart.

16 • Common short cases
 HINT 
 Try to put the signs together. Common respiratory short cases include:
 1.  ILD (dry cough, crackles and clubbing) 
 2.  bronchiectasis (loose cough, full sputum mug, coarse crackles and wheezes, clubbing) 
 3.  COPD (over-inﬂ ated chest, possible cyanosis, pursed-lips breathing, reduced breath 
sounds and wheezes, Hoover ’ s sign) 
 4.  pleural effusion (stony dullness, bronchial breathing on top, needle marks from 
previous aspirations) 
 5.  thoracoplasty (gross unilateral chest deformity, big scar) 
 6.  cystic ﬁ brosis (often young patient with signs of bronchiectasis and cachexia) 
 7.  treated carcinoma (sometimes clubbing, scar, radiotherapy marks, signs of effusion 
or collapse, lymph nodes). 
 HINT 
 Although tracheal deviation to the side of upper lobectomy is usual, a total pneumo-
nectomy may not cause deviation that can be detected clinically as it begins lower down 
– this will be apparent on the X-ray. 
 Chest X-ray ﬁ lms 
 Hints on how to read a chest X-ray film ( Fig. 16.23 ) 
 Th is is a valuable investigation and some even consider a chest X-ray as an extension 
of the physical examination. It is essential to be familiar with the various radiographic 
appearances. As a physician, you should feel personally responsible for viewing all the 
patient ’ s radiographs.
 1.  When fi rst viewing the chest radiograph, check:
 a.  fi lm date, to ensure that it is current 
 b.  type of fi lm – posteroanterior (PA) or anteroposterior (AP) fi lm; the latter (which 
may be labelled ‘portable’) magnifi es heart size, making assessment of cardiac 
diameter diffi  cult 
 c.  correct orientation – the left side is most reliably determined by the position of 
stomach gas 
 d.  fi lm ‘centring’ – the medial ends of each clavicle should be equidistant from 
the spines of the vertebrae; rotation aff ects the mediastinal and hilar shadows, 
causing undue prominence on the side opposite that to which the patient was 
turned. 
 2.  Next, systematically examine the PA fi lm, comparing right and left sides carefully for 
abnormalities of:
 a.  soft tissues (e.g. mastectomy, subcutaneous emphysema) and bony skeleton (e.g. 
rib fractures, malignant deposits) 
 b.  tracheal displacement, paratracheal masses 
 c.  heart size, borders and retrocardiac density 
 d.  aorta and upper mediastinum (count the ribs, look for mediastinal shift, mediastinal 
masses – see  Figs 16.23 and  16.24 )

 g.  lung fi elds – upper zone (to lower border of second rib), mid zone (from upper 
zone to lower border of fourth rib) and lower zone (from midzone to diaphragm) 
 h.  pleura 
 i.  gastric bubble (normally there should be no opacity  > 0.5 cm above the air bubble) 
 j.  the presence of monitoring leads, a permanent or temporary pacemaker, surgical 
clips central lines or other ‘hardware’. 
 Learn to do all this rapidly and accurately. 
 3.  Finally, always ask to look at a lateral fi lm. Examine it just as carefully. Th e lateral 
fi lm is used to help decide the exact anatomical site of an abnormality. 
 Candidates must learn the normal position of the fi ssures (the horizontal fi ssure, seen 
sometimes on the PA and lateral fi lm, is a fi ne horizontal line at the level of the fourth 
costal cartilage, whereas the oblique fi ssure is seen only sometimes on the lateral, beginning 
at the level of the fi fth thoracic vertebra and running downwards to the diaphragm at 
the junction of its anterior and middle thirds). 
 Th e lung segments must also be memorised (see  Fig. 16.23 ). Remember: abnormalities 
in the lung fi elds are described by terms such as ‘mottling’, ‘opacity’ or ‘shadow’ – it is 
usually unwise to attempt to make a precise diagnosis of the underlying pathology in 
your initial assessment of the chest X-ray ( Table 16.15 ). 
 Some common radiological abnormalities 
 Th e following X-rays and scans ( Figs 16.24–16.33 ) show some important changes 
associated with pulmonary disease.

 THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM 
 The abdominal examination 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This man has had episodes of abdominal discomfort. Please examine his abdomen.’ 
 2.  ‘This woman has been found to have an abdominal mass. Please examine her.’ 
 3.  ‘This woman has developed jaundice. Please examine her.’ 
 4.  ‘This man has been losing weight recently. Please examine his abdomen.’ 
 5.  ‘This man has had bloody diarrhoea. Please examine his abdomen.’ 
 6.  ‘This woman has noticed abdominal distension. Please examine her.’ 
 Method ( Table 16.16 ) 
 1.  Position the patient correctly, with one pillow for the head and complete exposure 
of the abdomen. 
 2.  Briefl y look at the patient ’ s general appearance and inspect particularly for signs of 
chronic liver disease and renal disease. 
 3.  Inspect the abdomen from the side, squatting to the patient ’ s level. Large masses 
may be visible. Ask the patient to take slow, deep breaths – an enlarged liver or 
spleen may be seen to move downwards during inspiration. Stand up and look for 
scars, distension, prominent veins, striae, bruising and pigmentation. 
 4.  Palpate lightly in each quadrant for masses ( Tables 16.17–16.22 ). Ask fi rst whether 
any particular area is tender (to avoid causing pain and also to obtain a clue to the 
site of possible pathology). Next palpate more deeply in each quadrant and then 
feel specifi cally for hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. A palpable liver may be a result 
of enlargement or ptosis. If there is hepatomegaly (see  Table 16.17 ), confi rm with 
percussion and estimate the span (normal span is approximately 12.5 cm). Th e same 
procedure is followed for splenomegaly (use a two-handed technique) (see  Table 
16.21 ). Percussion is useful to exclude splenomegaly (over the lowest intercostal 
space in the left anterior axillary line; if dull in full inspiration, suspect splenomegaly 
and palpate again 2 ). Always roll the patient on to the right side and palpate again 
if no spleen is palpable. Be seen to watch the patient ’ s face intermittently for signs 
that the examination is uncomfortable. 
 5.  Carefully feel for the kidneys bimanually. Remember that any left-sided mass may 
arise from a number of sites. 
 2 Ludwig Traube described a space defi ned superiorly by the sixth rib, laterally by the mid-axillary line 
and inferiorly by the left costal margin, which is normally resonant to percussion. It becomes dull if the 
spleen is enlarged or there is a left-sided pleural eff usion. If this area is resonant, it is very unlikely the 
spleen will be palpable by any other manoeuvre. 
 HINT 
 Bimanual palpation of the kidneys (ballotting) will not work unless the hand under the 
patient is placed vertically (almost to the spine).

 Table 16.19   Adult polycystic kidneys 
If you ﬁ nd polycystic kidneys, remember these very important points: 
 1.  Take the blood pressure (75% have hypertension) 
 2.  Examine the urine for haematuria (due to haemorrhage into a cyst) and proteinuria (usually less than 
2 g / day when measured) 
 3.  Look for evidence of anaemia (resulting from chronic kidney disease) or polycythaemia (due to high 
erythropoietin levels).  Note: The haemoglobin level is higher than expected for the degree of chronic 
kidney disease 
 4.  Note the presence of hepatic cysts (present in 30% of cases of polycystic renal disease) and splenic 
cysts (rare). These may cause confusion when examining the abdomen 
 Note: Subarachnoid haemorrhage occurs in 3% of patients as a result of intracranial aneurysm. As this is 
an autosomal dominant condition, all family members of patients with polycystic kidney disease should be 
assessed for kidney disease. Cerebral aneurysms can be screened for by MRI in patients with kidney disease, 
in the absence of a previous history of subarachnoid haemorrhage.

 4.  Inﬁ ltration – amyloidosis, sarcoidosis 
 5.  Connective tissue disease – systemic lupus erythematosus 
 6.  Acromegaly 
 7.  Thyrotoxicosis 
 6.  Th e usual distinguishing features of a spleen compared with a kidney are as follows.
 a.  Th e spleen has no palpable upper border. 
 b.  Th e spleen has a notch. 
 c.  Th e spleen moves inferomedially on respiration. 
 d.  Th ere is usually no resonance over a splenic mass. 
 e.  Th e spleen is not bimanually palpable (i.e. not ballottable). 
 f.  A friction rub may occasionally be heard over the spleen. 
 7.  Percuss for ascites as a routine. If the abdomen is resonant out to the fl anks on percus-
sion, do not roll the patient over. Otherwise, look for shifting dullness. Th e technique 
is usually performed by percussing away from your side of the bed until you reach 
a dull note, then rolling the patient towards you and waiting at least a short time 
before percussing again for resonance. 
 8.  Always auscultate briefl y over the liver, spleen and renal areas. Listen for bruits, rubs 
and a venous hum. Note the presence of bowel sounds. An arterial systolic bruit 
over the liver is usually caused by either hepatocellular carcinoma or acute alcoholic 
hepatitis. A friction rub over the liver may be caused by tumour, recent liver biopsy, 
infarction or gonococcal perihepatitis (rather unusual); splenic rubs indicate infarction. 
A venous hum occurs uncommonly in portal hypertension. 
 9.  Examine the groin next. Palpate for inguinal lymphadenopathy. Always ask if you 
may palpate the testes. 
 HINT 
 If you are asked to examine the gastrointestinal system rather than the abdomen, begin 
by examining the hands and go on to the arms, face, chest, abdomen and legs as 
described (see  Table 16.16 ). 
 10.  If you now suspect liver disease, you must go on and look for the peripheral stigmata 
of chronic liver disease. In this instance, it is probably better to proceed from the 
abdomen to the chest wall. Look for gynaecomastia, spider naevi ( Fig. 16.34 ), hair 
loss (in men) and breast atrophy (in women). Examine the breasts if you suspect 
intra-abdominal malignant disease.
 a.  Now sit the patient at 45° and measure the JVP so as not to miss constrictive 
pericarditis as a cause of cirrhosis. Palpate anteriorly for supraclavicular nodes, 
then sit the patient forwards and feel posteriorly for the other cervical nodes. 
Look at the back for sacral oedema and spider naevi. If ascites is present, examine 
the chest for pleural eff usions.

and look at the corneas for Kayser–Fleischer rings. Xanthelasma (see  Fig. 16.3 ) 
are common in patients with advanced primary biliary cholangitis. Feel for parotid 
enlargement, which may be present soon after an acute alcoholic binge. Inspect 
the mouth with a torch and spatula for angular stomatitis, ulceration and atrophic 
glossitis. Smell the breath for fetor hepaticus. 
 c.  Look at the arms for bruising and spider naevi. Next examine the hands. Ask the 
patient to extend his arms and hands and look for evidence of hepatic fl ap. Look 
also at the nails for clubbing and white nails (leukonychia) ( Fig. 16.35 ), and note 
any palmar erythema and Dupuytren ’ s contractures (the latter are associated with 
alcohol or trauma) ( Fig. 16.36b ). Th e arthropathy of haemochromatosis may also 
be present (a degenerative arthritis that particularly involves the second and third 
metacarpophalangeal joints). 
 d.  Next, examine the legs for oedema, bruising and any rashes. If you have found 
Dupuytren ’ s contractures in the hands, look for similar tendon thickening and 
shortening on the soles of the feet (see  Fig. 16.36a ); Dupuytren ’ s contracture of 
the foot. Look for the nervous system signs of alcoholism – namely, peripheral 
neuropathy, proximal myopathy, cerebellar syndrome, Wernicke ’ s encephalopathy 
(bilatera VI nerve palsies) and Korsakoff  ’ s psychosis.

 e.  Candidates are almost always stopped well before this stage. Do not forget to ask 
to perform a rectal examination and urine analysis. Also ask to look at the 
temperature chart. Ask whether you may further examine for hernias by asking 
the patient to stand and cough. 
 11.  If, on the other hand, you have found signs consistent with a haematological problem, 
proceed as described in that section. 
 12.  If you fi nd a pulsatile liver, examine the cardiovascular system and particularly note 
any other signs of tricuspid regurgitation.

 HINT 
 Haemochromatosis, an autosomal recessive disorder, is an important, but now uncommon, 
cause of liver disease. Consider this diagnosis if any of the following signs are present:
 •  pigmentation (bronze) 
 •  arthropathy (typically degenerative arthritis of the MCP joints of the index and middle 
ﬁ ngers, but any other joint may be involved; pseudogout may occur) 
 •  testicular atrophy (due to iron deposition in the pituitary gland) 
 •  dilated cardiomyopathy 
 •  glycosuria (as a result of diabetes mellitus). 
 THE HAEMATOLOGICAL SYSTEM 
 The haemopoietic examination 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This 75-year-old man has had problems with tiredness. Please examine his hae-
mopoietic system.’ 
 2.  ‘This man has been anaemic. Please examine his haematological system.’ 
 3.  ‘This woman has noticed abdominal fullness. Please examine her abdomen.’ 
 4.  ‘This woman has noticed a rash on her arms and legs. Please examine her.’ 
 5.  ‘This man has been found to have cervical lymphadenopathy. Please examine him.’ 
 Method ( Table 16.23 ) 
 1.  If necessary, position the patient as for a gastrointestinal examination. Make sure 
he or she is fully undressed. Look for bruising, pigmentation, cyanosis, jaundice, 
scratch marks (due to myeloproliferative disease or lymphoma) and leg ulceration 
(see below). Also note the presence of frontal bossing and the racial origin of the 
patient (thalassaemia is more common in people of Asian or Greek background). 
 2.  Pick up the patient ’ s hands. Look at the nails for koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails, 
which are rarely seen today and which indicate iron defi ciency) and the changes of 
vasculitis. Pale palmar creases suggest anaemia (usually the haemoglobin level is 
 < 90 g / L). Evidence of arthropathy may be important – for example, rheumatoid 
arthritis and Felty ’ s syndrome, recurrent haemarthroses in bleeding disorders or 
secondary gout in myeloproliferative disorders. 
 3.  Examine the epitrochlear nodes. Do this by placing your palm under the patient ’ s 
elbow – your thumb will be placed over the appropriate area (proximal and slightly 
anterior to the medial epicondyle). A palpable node is usually pathological and may 
 14.  If malignant disease is suspected, examine all the node groups, the lungs and the 
breasts after a thorough abdominal examination. Non-haematological malignant 
disease that causes hepatomegaly rarely leads to splenomegaly unless the portal vein 
is directly involved.

 Fig. 16.37 ) are pinhead haemorrhages, whereas ecchymoses are larger bruises. Palpable 
purpura suggests vasculitis (idiopathic, hepatitis C, cancer), cryoglobulinaemia or 
bacteraemia (cutaneous emboli). 
 4.  Go to the axillae and palpate the axillary nodes. Do this by raising the patient ’ s arm 
and placing your fi ngers as high as possible in the axilla. Th en position the patient ’ s 
forearm comfortably over your own forearm. Use your left hand for the patient ’ s 
right axilla, and vice versa. Th ere are four main areas: central, lateral (above and 
lateral), pectoral (most medial) and subscapular (most inferior). 
 5.  Look at the patient ’ s face. Inspecting the eyes, note any jaundice, pallor or haemorrhage 
of the sclera, or the injected sclera of polycythaemia. 
 HINT 
 Anaemia is most accurately detected by pulling down one of the patient ’ s lower eyelids 
and comparing the colour of the anterior part of the conjunctiva with the pearly white 
of the palpebral conjunctiva more posteriorly. The anterior conjunctiva should be distinctly 
redder in colour unless signiﬁ cant anaemia ( < 100 g / L) is present.

 7.  Now sit the patient up. Examine the cervical nodes from behind ( Fig. 16.39 ). Th ere 
are seven groups: submental, submandibular, jugular chain, posterior triangle, 
postauricular, preauricular and occipital. Th en feel the supraclavicular area from the 
front. Tap the spine with your fi st for bony tenderness (which can be caused by an 
enlarging marrow – e.g. in myeloma, carcinoma). Also gently press the sternum, 
clavicles and shoulders for bony tenderness. 
 8.  Lay the patient fl at again. Examine the abdomen, particularly for splenomegaly (see 
 Table 16.21 ) and hepatomegaly (see  Tables 16.17 and  16.22 ). 
 9.  Spring the hips for pelvic tenderness. 
 10.  Palpate the inguinal nodes. Th ere are two groups – along the inguinal ligament and 
along the femoral vessels. Remember to ask to feel the testes and ask to do a rectal 
examination (e.g. for melaena). 3 
 11.  Examine the legs. Note particularly leg ulcers, which may occur with hereditary 
spherocytosis, sickle cell syndromes, thalassaemia, macroglobulinaemia and Felty ’ s 
syndrome. Ask to examine the legs from a neurological aspect for evidence of vitamin 
B 12 defi ciency. Remember, hypothyroidism and lead poisoning can cause anaemia 
and peripheral neuropathy. Do not miss Henoch–Schönlein purpura over the buttocks 
and legs ( Fig. 16.40 ). 
 12.  Finally, ask to examine the fundi (for engorged retinal vessels, papilloedema, haemor-
rhages, etc.) ( Fig. 16.41a and b) and look at the temperature chart. Causes of 
generalised lymphadenopathy are presented in  Table 16.24 .

 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 
 The thyroid gland 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This 40-year-old woman has noticed some discomfort in her neck. Please examine 
her.’ (Look for a goitre but don ’ t miss other neck pathology.) 
 2.  ‘This woman has noticed loss of weight and has a tremor. Please examine her.’ 
(Think of thyrotoxicosis (obviously).) 
 Method ( Table 16.25 ) 
 Th e most likely problem is thyroid disease, but in the neck examination you should 
also consider the possibilities of superior vena caval obstruction, cervical lymphadenopathy, 
carotid aneurysm or bruit, JVP abnormalities and tracheal deviation.
 1.  Take time fi rst to look at the face for signs of thyrotoxicosis or myxoedema (see 
point 7 below). 
 2.  With the patient sitting up and the neck fully exposed, inspect for scars, swelling 
and prominent veins. Look at the front and the sides. Ask the patient to swallow 
a sip of water and look for thyroid enlargement. Th e thyroid moves up with 
swallowing. 
 3.  Palpate gently from behind, with the neck fl exed, feeling for any thyroid mass 
( Table 16.26 ). Use one hand to steady the gland and the other to feel. Note the 
shape, consistency and distribution of the thyroid enlargement. If a nodule is palpable, 
determine whether this is single or part of a multinodular goitre. Ask the patient 
whether the gland is tender (a clue to subacute thyroiditis) and note any hoarseness of 
 HINT 
 The presence of a glass of water beside the patient suggests you are expected to examine 
the thyroid.

 5.  Simple goitre (iodine deﬁ ciency) 
 6.  Goitrogens – iodine excess, drugs (e.g. lithium, phenylbutazone) 
 7.  Inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis – Pendreds syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition 
associated with nerve deafness 
the voice (which may be caused by recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy). Decide whether 
you can palpate the lower border of the gland (to exclude retrosternal extension) and 
whether there is a thrill. Feel for cervical lymphadenopathy from behind (see  Fig. 
16.39 ). Palpate each carotid artery (absence possibly indicating malignant infi ltration). 
Test the sternocleidomastoid function, as malignant disease may infi ltrate this muscle. 
Finally, palpate the gland from in front and note the tracheal position. 
 4.  Percuss over the upper part of the manubrium from one side to the other, right 
across the bone, and note any change from resonant to dull (a sign of retrosternal 
extension). 
 5.  Auscultate over the thyroid gland for bruits (a sign of active thyrotoxicosis) and 
also over the carotid arteries. A systolic fl ow murmur is common when patients are 
thyrotoxic.

Elsevier, 2009, with permission. 
 6.  Remember Pemberton ’ s sign (see  Fig. 16.42 ). Ask the patient to lift his or her arms 
over the head. Look for suff usion of the face, elevation of the JVP and inspiratory 
stridor. Any retrosternal mass may cause these changes. 
 7.  If there is evidence of a goitre and obvious eye disease (indicating the presence of 
 thyrotoxicosis ;  Table 16.27 ), proceed to the face. Examine the eyes for exophthalmos 
by noting the presence of sclera below the cornea when the patient is looking straight 
ahead. Note lid retraction by looking for the presence of sclera above the cornea. 
Th en test for lid lag by asking the patient to follow your fi nger descending at a 
moderate rate. Now examine the conjunctiva for chemosis. 
 8.  Test eye movements for ophthalmoplegia. In thyrotoxicosis the inferior oblique 
muscle power is lost fi rst, then convergence is aff ected, followed by the other muscles. 
Examine the fundi because optic atrophy can occur late. Th en look from behind, 
over the patient ’ s forehead, when he or she is looking forward, for proptosis. 
 9.  Examine the patient ’ s outstretched hands for tremor. It is worthwhile placing a sheet 
of paper over the dorsal aspects of the fi ngers. Look at the nails for onycholysis 
(Plummer ’ s nails) – distal separation of the nail from its bed – and thyroid acropachy 
(this looks like clubbing and is clubbing, but is not called clubbing). Note any 
palmar erythema. Feel for warmth and sweating. Feel the radial pulse for sinus 
tachycardia, atrial fi brillation or a collapsing pulse. 
 10.  Test for proximal myopathy in the arms and tap the arm refl exes for briskness.

 4.  Factitious 
 Note: The three components of Graves’ disease – viz. eye signs, hyperthyroidism with goitre and pretibial 
myxoedema – run independent courses. 
 11.  If there is time, proceed to the legs and look for skin manifestations: pretibial 
myxoedema – bilateral fi rm, elevated dermal nodules and plaques that can be pink, 
brown or skin-coloured and that are caused by mucopolysaccharide accumulation 
– and vitiligo. Test for proximal myopathy and hyperrefl exia in the legs. 
 12.  Ask to examine the chest for evidence of gynaecomastia (in men) and the heart for 
an ejection systolic murmur and signs of congestive cardiac failure.

 13.  Although it is rarely of importance, there may also be mild splenomegaly and 
hepatomegaly on abdominal examination (see  Tables 16.17, 16.21 and 16.22 ), as 
well as generalised lymphadenopathy. 
 14.  If a thyroidectomy scar is present, ask to look for the signs of hypocalcaemia (i.e. 
Chvostek ’ s and Trousseau ’ s signs). Chvostek ’ s sign may be present in normal patients. 
It is tested by tapping over the facial nerve 3–5 cm below and in front of the ear. 
Th e facial muscle twitches briefl y in the presence of hypocalcaemia. Trousseau ’ s sign 
is tested by pumping up a sphygmomanometer cuff  above systolic blood pressure 
and looking for  main d ’ accoucheur (a strongly adducted thumb with fi ngers extended 
except at the MCP joints) that occurs within 2 minutes. 
 15.  If you suspect  hypothyroidism (when goitre is unusual) ( Table 16.28 ), proceed as 
follows.
 a.  Examine the hands. Note any peripheral cyanosis, swelling and dry, cold skin. 
Look at the palmar creases for anaemia ( Table 16.29 ). Feel the pulse for bradycardia 
and a small volume. Test for carpal tunnel syndrome. Ask the patient to fl ex both 
wrists for 30 seconds – paraesthesiae will often be precipitated in the aff ected 
hand if this syndrome is present (Phalen ’ s wrist fl exion test). 
 b.  Test for delayed relaxation of the biceps jerk. Examine for proximal myopathy, 
which is rare. 
 c.  Proceed to the face. Note here any general swelling and periorbital oedema. Look 
for loss of the outer one-third of the eyebrows and periorbital xanthelasma. Note 
whether the skin is dry, fi ne and smooth. Th ere may be signs of carotenaemia, 
alopecia or vitiligo (see  Fig. 16.49 ). Look at the tongue, which may be swollen, then 
ask the patient to tell you his or her name and address, and note any hoarseness 
or slowness of speech. Test for nerve deafness, which may be bilateral.

 3.  Look at the face more closely. Multiple fi ne skin wrinkles around the eyes and mouth are 
characteristic of growth hormone defi ciency. Look closely for a hypophysectomy scar on 
the forehead near the inner canthus of the eye. Examine the eyes for signs of a pituitary 
tumour (visual fi elds, especially for bitemporal hemianopia, fundi for optic atrophy) and 
assess cranial nerves III, IV and VI, as well as the fi rst division of V (aff ected by tumour 
extension into the cavernous sinus). Feel the facial hair over the chin area. 
 4.  Go to the chest and look for decreased body hair and pale skin (and gynaecomastia 
in men). Lay the patient down and look for loss of pubic hair and testicular atrophy 
(in males testes are small and soft – the normal size is 15–25 mL in volume). 
 5.  Test the ankle jerks (for slow relaxation in hypothyroidism – there is no myxoedematous 
appearance) and ask to check the blood pressure with the patient lying and standing 
(hypotension with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) defi ciency). 
 Cushing ’ s syndrome 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This woman has noted weight gain. Please examine her.’ 
 2.  ‘This woman has difﬁ culty standing up from a chair and changes in her appearance. 
Please examine her.’ 
 Method ( Table 16.32 ) 
 Th is type of introduction may mean Cushing ’ s syndrome in the clinical examination 
( Fig. 16.45a–c ). Make sure that the patient is undressed to her underwear and ask her 
to stand.
 1.  Look at the patient from the front, sides and behind. Note central obesity with 
peripheral sparing and look at the skin for bruising, atrophy and pigmentation of 
extensor areas. Hyperpigmentation suggests an ectopic ACTH-secreting tumour, or 
it may indicate an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma in a patient who has had a 
bilateral adrenalectomy (Nelson ’ s syndrome). 
 2.  Test for proximal myopathy of the arms and also of the legs (initially by getting the 
patient to squat). Examine the back for a buff alo hump and feel it. Look for kypho-
scoliosis and tap the spine for bony tenderness as a result of osteoporotic vertebral 
crush fractures. 
 3.  Ask the patient to sit on the side of the bed. Look at the face for plethora, hirsutism, 
acne, telangiectasia and a moon shape. 
 4.  Test the eyes for visual fi eld defects (which are uncommon) and look in the fundi 
for papilloedema (caused by benign intracranial hypertension or a pituitary tumour) 
and optic atrophy, as well as hypertensive or diabetic changes (see  Tables 16.7 and 
 16.41 ). Th en look at the neck for supraclavicular fat pads and acanthosis nigricans. 
 5.  Ask the patient to lie down. Examine the abdomen for adrenalectomy scars, pigmenta-
tion, striae and adrenal masses. Ask the patient and the examiners if you may look 
at the genitalia. Virilisation in women or gynaecomastia in men suggests that adrenal 
carcinoma is more likely. Next, look at the legs for oedema, bruising and poor wound 
healing. 
 6.  Do not forget to ask for the results of urine analysis (glucose) and take the blood 
pressure (hypertension). Diagnostic tests are summarised in  Table 16.33 .

 SCREENING TESTS 
 1.  Cortisol levels morning and evening (serum or salivary): loss of diurnal rhythm (evening cortisol level 
should be less than half the morning value) of little diagnostic value 
 2.  24-hour urine collection for urinary free cortisol determination (an indirect assessment of cortisol 
production). Should be threefold increased (above normal) 
 3.  Overnight dexamethasone suppression test (1 mg dexamethasone at midnight causes suppression of 
cortisol in normal subjects at 9.00 am). No suppression is found in Cushing ’ s syndrome, but this may 
also occur with alcoholism, induction of hepatic enzymes (e.g. phenytoin) or depression, in patients 
taking the contraceptive pill and in some obese patients 
 4.  Blood count (secondary polycythaemia, neutrophil leukocytosis, eosinopenia) 
 5.  Electrolyte levels (hypokalaemic alkalosis, particularly with ectopic ACTH-producing tumours) 
 6.  Blood sugar level (hyperglycaemia) 
 DEFINITIVE TESTS 
 1.  2 mg dexamethasone suppression test (0.5 mg 6-hourly for 48 hours). No suppression of plasma 
cortisol or urinary free cortisol occurs in Cushing ’ s syndrome, but usually suppression does occur in 
normal subjects, obese patients and depressed patients 
 2.  8 mg dexamethasone suppression test (2 mg 6-hourly for 48 hours). Suppression occurs in Cushing ’ s 
disease, but no suppression is usually found in adrenal adenoma or carcinoma or in the presence of 
ectopic ACTH production. False-positive results can occur in patients taking anticonvulsants (which 
accelerate dexamethasone metabolism) 
 3.  ACTH level – high in ectopic ACTH production; low with adrenal adenoma or carcinoma, high or 
normal in Cushing ’ s disease. Ectopic secretion of CRH by tumours is a very rare cause of Cushing ’ s 
syndrome 
 4.  Petrosal sinus ACTH sampling – a central-to-peripheral venous cortisol ratio of  > 2 : 1 is diagnostic of 
Cushing ’ s disease; lateralisation of ACTH production helps the neurosurgeon plan trans-sphenoidal 
exploration of the sella 
To diagnose Cushing ’ s syndrome, at least two deﬁ nitive tests should be abnormal
 Note: If Cushing ’ s disease is present, pituitary assessment is necessary. If adrenal disease is suspected, CT 
scanning is useful to assess the anatomy. Remember, ectopic ACTH production by a tumour (e.g. small 
cell carcinoma of lung, carcinoid of lung or thymus, pancreatic islet cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma) 
does not usually cause Cushingoid clinical features but may present with hyperpigmentation, hypokalaemic 
alkalosis and hypertension. 
 a Cushing ’ s disease is speciﬁ cally pituitary ACTH over-production. 
 Acromegaly 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This man has noted some change in his facial appearance. Please examine him.’ 
( Fig. 16.46a to c ) 
 2.  ‘This man has acromegaly. Please examine him for activity and features of the 
disease.’ 
 Method ( Table 16.34 ) 
 Th e order and direction of the examination obviously depend on the stem. However, 
if a ‘change of appearance’ of any part of the body is mentioned in the stem it is likely 
you are expected to make a spot diagnosis. Look very carefully at the patient before 
deciding where to examine.

 The change to a written stem has led to variations on this introduction. At one end of 
the spectrum the examiners may give the diagnosis: ‘This 64-year-old man has acromegaly. 
Please examine him to assess the extent and activity of the condition.’ At the other end 
of the spectrum the introduction may be more oblique: ‘This 64-year-old man has had 
premature and severe arthritis. Please examine his knees.’ The examiners have been 
advised at their calibration sessions to make the stem very clear.

 10.  Do not forget to ask for the results of a urine analysis to exclude glycosuria secondary 
to glucose intolerance and to take the blood pressure (hypertension is an association). 
Decide whether the acromegaly is active ( Table 16.36 ). Ask whether any photographs 
taken of the patient over the years are available for inspection (typically, manifestations 
begin in middle age). See  Table 16.37 for the diagnostic evaluation.

 Method 
 Fortunately, you suspect Addison ’ s disease.
 1.  Ensure the patient is appropriately undressed (to the underwear) and look for pigmenta-
tion ( Fig. 16.48 ) (particularly in the palmar creases, elbows, gums and buccal mucosa, 
genital areas and scars) and vitiligo ( Fig. 16.49 ), due to an autoimmune disease 
association. Ear lobe calcifi cation occurs rarely. 
 2.  Take the blood pressure and test for a postural drop. Ask for the results of a urine 
analysis, as diabetes is associated with Addison ’ s disease. Remember that the rest of 
the autoimmune cluster may also be associated ( Table 16.38 ) and consider the possible 
causes ( Table 16.39 ). Diagnostic tests are summarised in  Table 16.40 .

 6.  Now examine the eyes for visual acuity. Remember, episodes of poor control cause 
lens abnormalities acutely. Look for Argyll Robertson pupils (which are rare). 
Remember, a diabetic third nerve palsy is usually pupil sparing – infarction aff ects 
the inner more than the outer fi bres, whereas compressive lesions aff ect the outer 
fi bres fi rst and so involve the pupil early on. 
 7.  Look in the fundi for diabetic retinopathy ( Table 16.43 ,  Fig. 16.52 ). While performing 
fundoscopy, also note the presence of cataracts and any new blood vessel formation 
over the iris (rubeosis).

 THE RHEUMATOLOGICAL SYSTEM 
 In this section, only the common joints that are encountered in the examination are 
discussed. 
 The hands 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This 67-year-old woman has arthritis. Please examine her hands.’ ( Fig. 16.54 ) 
 2.  ‘This man has had pain in his hands, please examine him.’ (The use of the 
word  pain makes it likely the examination is a rheumatological rather than a neu-
rological one.) 
 3.  ‘This patient has had difﬁ culty using her hands. Please examine her.’ (This stem is 
more ambiguous and the decision about which examination to perform will depend 
on what changes are seen during inspection of the hands.) Often the examiners, 
alarmed at the thought that candidates will begin to examine neurologically instead 
of rheumatologically, will say ‘please perform a rheumatological examination’. 
 Method (see  Table 16.45 ) 
 When you are asked to examine the hands consider the possibilities of arthropathy, 
acromegaly, a peripheral nerve lesion, a myopathy or a neuropathy. Th e stem will usually 
help. 
 Remember the principles of joint examination:
 •  Look (inspection) 
 •  Feel (palpation) and move passively 
 •  Test function 
 •  Presence of extra-articular manifestations of arthritis.

 HINT 
 The diagnosis of arthritis is usually made during the inspection. Note the nature of the 
joint abnormalities and the pattern of joint involvement. Time spent on inspection is 
not wasted. 
 HINT – THE ‘HAND DANCE’ 
 A slick exam and presentation will always do wonders for your credibility to the examiners. 
 The ‘hand dance’ before you formally work through all the examination steps can 
be done in 20–30 seconds and gives you a lot of information early on. 
 With the patient sitting:
 1.  Ask the patient to lift his or her pronated open hands in front of the body. This will 
allow you to inspect the skin and joints of the dorsal aspects of the forearms, hands 
and nails, and assess for extensor weakness of the hands. 
 2.  Ask them to turn their hands over. This tests supination of the wrist and you can 
inspect the palmar surfaces of the hands. 
 3.  Ask ‘Close the hand.’ Any issue with weakness of ﬁ nger ﬂ exors may become apparent 
and you will get a closer look at the interphalangeal joints (IPJs). 
 4.  Ask ‘Open the hand again.’ Reduced range of motion in ﬁ nger extension due to 
either weakness or contractures may be seen. 
 5.  Ask ‘Make the prayer sign.’ Range of movement (ROM) of the wrist is assessed. 
 6.  Ask ‘Do the reverse prayer sign.’ This also tests ROM of the wrists but if, in the 
short time the patient is performing this, pain or tingling develops in the median 
nerve distribution, this is suspicious for carpal tunnel syndrome. 
 7.  Ask the patient to put his or her hands behind the head with elbows pointing towards 
the front of the body. This tests external rotation of the shoulder as well as function 
(relevant for being able to dress yourself or brush your hair). At this point, inspect 
the skin on the dorsal elbow joint. 
 8.  Horizontally abduct both arms to 90°. This tests strength and ROM in the shoulders. 
If there is some arthritis in the larger joints, you will quickly ﬁ nd out without having 
to hurt the patient, something often missed in a focused hands exam. 
 9.  Ask ‘Put your hands down behind your back.’ This tests internal rotation, which is 
another indication of function. 
 During the ‘hand dance’, look out for obvious rashes, muscle atrophy, scars and 
joint deformity. This is a  screening test to help identify the major ﬁ ndings before going 
over them in more detail. 
 Start with the hand ‘hand dance’ (hint box). Th en, if there is obvious joint disease, 
systematically examine as follows.
 •  Look 
 1.  Look at the patient for Cushingoid features (steroid treatment is more likely if 
the problem is rheumatoid arthritis or SLE). 
 2.  Look around the room for walking sticks, wheelie walkers or other aids to 
mobility. 
 3.  Make the patient comfortable; expose as much of the hands and forearms as 
possible.

 4.  Ask the patient to show you his or her elbows. Look for ease of movement of the 
elbows and shoulders, and for rheumatoid nodules or a psoriatic rash on the 
elbows or extensor tendons. 
 5.  Now place the patient ’ s hands on a pillow, palms down. 
 6.  Take some time to look at the hands, as the diagnosis is often made by inspection. 
Is there a symmetrical deforming polyarthropathy involving the wrists and hands? 
Are the DIP joints spared? 
 HINT 
 If the DIP joints are spared, the diagnosis is likely to be rheumatoid arthritis or SLE. If 
the DIP joints are involved, consider: nodal osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis 
or psoriatic arthritis. 
 7.  Look at the skin for erythema, ecchymoses or skin atrophy (this may indicate 
steroid use), scars (tendon release or transfer) and rashes. 
 
 
496
Examination Medicine
 8.  Th en look for swelling and its distribution, wrist deformity and muscle wasting 
involving the forearms and interosseous muscles. 
 9.  Go on to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Note, if present, any skin 
abnormalities, swelling and deformity ( Fig. 16.55 ), and particularly ulnar deviation 
and volar subluxation, ‘swan necking’ and boutonnière deformity of the fi ngers, 
and ‘Z’ deformity of the thumb. Sausage-shaped phalanges and telescoping of 
the fi ngers with predominant interphalangeal joint disease usually mean psoriatic 
arthropathy ( Fig. 16.55 ) or Reiter ’ s disease (reactive arthritis) ( Fig. 16.56 ). Small 
joint ankylosis is common. Look for telangiectasiae. 
 10.  Next look at the nails and describe any psoriatic nail changes (present in the great 
majority of patients with psoriatic arthritis) – namely pitting, onycholysis, 
hyperkeratosis, ridging and discoloration. Note the signs of vasculitis (splinter 
haemorrhages or black to brown 1–2 mm skin infarcts, usually in a periungual 
location) and mention this to the examiners. 
 11.  Now ask the patient to open and close the hands. Th is will reveal tendon ruptures 
and fi xed fl exion deformities. 
 12.  Turn the wrists over and look at the palms for scars ( Fig. 16.57 ), palmar erythema 
and muscle wasting. 
 13.  Next, describe the proximal and distal interphalangeal (PIP and DIP) joints. 
Symmetrical wrist, MCP and proximal joint swellings suggest rheumatoid arthritis. 
Swelling of the lateral aspects of the PIP and DIP joints is suggestive of osteoarthritis, 
and especially of nodal OA in women. Th ese are Heberden ’ s and Bouchard ’ s 
nodes. Th ese are hard and painless.

Examination Medicine
 •  Feel / move passively 
 1.  Palpate each joint, starting with the wrists. 
 2.  Feel for synovitis (boggy swelling) and eff usions. As you feel, remember that the 
joint line is the place where these changes occur. 
 3.  Note the range of passive movement of the joint. 
 4.  Feel for any joint crepitus. 
 5.  Palpate the ulnar styloid for tenderness. 
 6.  When examining the MCP joints, also feel for subluxation. 
 7.  Test for palmar tendon crepitus (tenosynovitis). 
 •  Test function 
 1.  Test grip strength, key grip and opposition strength (thumb and little fi nger). 
 2.  Ask the patient to perform a practical procedure, such as undoing a button or 
writing something. 
 3.  A formal neurological examination of the hand is not required in assessing arthropathy. 
However, a ganglion or tenosynovitis may cause the carpal tunnel syndrome. 
 4.  Ask the patient to fl ex both wrists together for 30 seconds – paraesthesiae will 
often be precipitated in the aff ected hand if the carpal tunnel syndrome is present 
(Phalen ’ s wrist fl exion test). Tap over the carpal tunnel while the wrist is held in 
extension for Tinel ’ s sign (paraesthesiae in the distribution of the median nerve). 
Th ese tests have similar but limited specifi city and sensitivity. 
 5.  If there is time, check sensation in the median and ulna nerve distributions. 
 •  Extra-articular manifestations and the extent of the disease 
 At this point you need to decide whether to ask to examine other joints or look for 
other abnormalities.
 1.  If other joints seem obviously abnormal or are on display (e.g. shoes are off ) ask to 
look at them. 
 2.  Always look for psoriatic patches (hairline, behind the ears, extensor surfaces) as this 
may be an important clue to the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. 
 3.  If the patient is seated in a chair with a number of layers of clothing covering the chest 
it is unlikely the examiners will want you to examine the heart or lungs. However, if you 
feel strongly that you want to do this, it is better to ask to put the patient onto the bed 
and remove the shirt rather than to try to examine the chest through layers of clothing. 
 You should now have an idea of the pattern and severity of the deformity, as well as 
the extent of the loss of function and the activity of the disease. Always consider the 
diff erential diagnosis of a deforming polyarthropathy:
 •  rheumatoid arthritis (see  Figs 16.58, 16.59, 16.66 and 16.67 ) 
 •  seronegative arthropathies – particularly psoriatic arthritis (see  Figs 16.60, 16.61, 
16.68 and 16.69 ) 
 •  polyarticular gout (look for tophi) (see  Figs 16.62a , b and 16.70) or pseudogout 
( Fig. 16.63 ) 
 •  primary generalised osteoarthritis (where DIP and PIP joint involvement is common) 
(see  Figs 16.64, 16.65 and 16.71 ). 
Text continued on p. 504

 HINTS 
 Severe osteoarthritis can cause hand deformity. Sometimes more than the DIP and PIP 
joints are involved, but these are usually the worst. 
 Destructive changes (especially shortening and telescoping of digits) and DIP disease 
suggest seronegative arthropathy – look carefully for psoriasis. 
 Practise highlighting the important features of arthritis early in your presentation 
(e.g. symmetrical / asymmetrical, mono / oligo or polyarthritis, associated nodules or 
rash, signs of activity, impact on function and extra-articular features) most consistent 
with your provisional diagnosis.

 At the end, ask whether you may examine all the other joints that are likely to be 
involved and the other systems likely to be aff ected. 
 Present your fi ndings and give a diff erential diagnosis, in order of likelihood. 
 Say whether you think there are signs of active disease (e.g. synovitis).

Examination Medicine
 Method 
 If walking has been mentioned in the stem, ask if you may begin by walking the patient 
and begin with a gait examination ( p. 571 ). So that there will be time to examine the 
knees themselves, leave out Romberg ’ s test. 
 Even if walking has not been mentioned, if the patient is sitting in a chair ask whether 
you may get him or her to stand and walk. If the patient is already lying down, begin 
there but, if there is time, test knee function (walking) at the end. 
 Expose both knees and thighs fully and have the patient lie on his or her back.
 •  Look 
 1.  Look around the room for walking aids and at the patient ’ s general appearance 
(e.g. for signs of Cushing ’ s syndrome or acromegaly). 
 2.  Th en look for quadriceps wasting. 
 3.  Th en look over the knees for any skin abnormalities (scars or rashes), swelling and 
deformity; synovial swelling is seen medial to the patella and in the suprapatellar 
area. 
 4.  Fixed fl exion deformity must be assessed; inspect the knee from the side (a space 
beneath the knee will be visible). 
 •  Feel / move passively 
 1.  Feel the quadriceps for wasting. 
 2.  Ask the patient whether there is any pain or tenderness and palpate for warmth 
and synovitis over the knee joint. 
 3.  Examine for eff usions – the patella tap (ballottement) is used to confi rm a large 
eff usion. Th e fl uid from the suprapatellar bursa is pushed by the hand into the 
joint space by squeezing the lower part of the quadriceps and then pushing the 
patella downwards with the fi ngers. Th e patella will be ballottable if fl uid is 
present under it. In patients with a smaller eff usion, pressing over the lateral 
knee compartment may produce a noticeable medial bulge as a result of fl uid 
displacement. 
 4.  Test fl exion and extension passively and note the range of movement and the 
presence or absence of crepitus. 
 5.  Examine again for fi xed fl exion deformity by gently extending the knee. 
 6.  Test the ligaments next. Th e lateral and medial collateral ligaments are tested 
by having the knee slightly fl exed, holding the leg with the right hand and arm, 
steadying the thigh with the left hand and moving the leg laterally and medially. 
Movements of more than 5°–10° are abnormal. Th e cruciate ligaments are tested by 
steadying the foot with your elbow and moving the leg anteriorly and posteriorly 
with the other hand. Again, laxity of more than 5°–10° is abnormal ( Fig. 16.72 a 
and b ). 
 7.  Use McMurray ’ s test for meniscal integrity. Hold the lower leg and foot, fl ex and 
extend the knee while internally and externally rotating the tibia. Listen for a 
popping sensation and inability then to extend the knee in a meniscal tear. 
 8.  Ask the patient to stand up and examine for a Baker ’ s cyst, which is felt in the 
popliteal fossa and is more obvious when the knee is extended. 
 •  Test function i.e. ask the patient to walk. 
 •  Examine other joints that may be involved. 
 At the end, present your fi ndings and diff erential diagnosis. 
 Say whether the disease is active. 
 Ask to look at X-rays ( Figs 16.73 and  16.74 ). 
 Ask for sensible blood tests to confi rm the diagnosis and assess activity or severity 
(e.g. infl ammatory markers, serology, ferritin (haemochromatosis)).

 HINT 
 The knees and other hinge joints are commonly affected in patients with arthritis secondary 
to haemophilia. The pattern of joint involvement and juxta-articular bony sclerosis on 
X-ray ﬁ lm help to distinguish this from rheumatoid arthritis involving the knees (see 
 Figs 16.73 and  16.74 ).

 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This woman has painful feet. Please examine her.’ (arthritis or neuropathy or both) 
 2.  ‘This man has difﬁ culty walking. Please examine his feet from a rheumatological 
aspect.’ 
 Method 
 •  Look 
 1.  As usual, glance around the room for walking aids and at the patient for signs of 
systemic disease, rashes, etc. 
 HINT 
 Although it is important to have a look around the room for clues, the examiners are 
a bit put out when some candidates prowl around the room and get down on their 
knees and look under the bed. 
 2.  Start by inspecting the ankles. Look at the skin of the feet and toes (for scars, 
ulcers and rashes), and look for swelling, deformity and muscle wasting.

more severe joint space loss.

 3.  Examine the midfoot and forefoot similarly. Deformities aff ecting the forefoot 
include hallux valgus and clawing and crowding of the toes (in rheumatoid arthritis). 
If pes cavus is present, consider an hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Pes 
cavus implies a long-term abnormality. 
 4.  Note any psoriatic nail changes. 
 5.  Look at the transverse and longitudinal arches. 
 6.  Look for callus over the metatarsal heads, which occurs in subluxation. 
 7.  Note any obvious gross deformities that suggest Charcot ’ s joints. 
 •  Feel / move passively 
 1.  Palpate, starting with the ankle, feeling for synovitis and eff usion. 
 2.  Passive movement of the talar joints (dorsifl exion and plantarfl exion) and subtalar 
joints (inversion and eversion) must be assessed. 
 3.  Th e best way to examine the subtalar and midtarsal joints is to fi x the os calcaneus 
and ankle joint with the left hand while inverting and everting the midfoot with 
the right. Tenderness on movement is more important than range of movement. 
Th e midfoot (midtarsal joint) allows rotation of the forefoot on a fi xed hindfoot. 
 4.  Squeeze the metatarsophalangeal joints for tenderness. 
 5.  Examining the individual toes is useful in seronegative spondyloarthropathies (a 
sausage-like swelling of the toe is characteristic of psoriatic arthritis).

 6.  Feel the Achilles tendon for nodules and palpate the inferior aspect of the heel for 
tenderness (plantar fasciitis). 
 •  Test function 
 1.  Consider a neurological examination – test pinprick sensation and proprioception. 
Go on to examine other joints as appropriate. 
 2.  If this wasn ’ t done at the start, ask the patient to walk. Try to associate the joint 
abnormalities with the character of the gait. 
 At the end, present the fi ndings and diff erential diagnosis. 
 X-rays of the feet are the most likely investigations that will be available 
( Figs 16.75–16.79 ). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis can have involvement of the 
cervical spine, hips and shoulders, and X-rays of these may also be available. 
 Serological tests may be relevant.

 The back 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This man has had back pain for many years. Please examine him.’ 
 The stem may not point you towards ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, it is 
always important to stand back and observe the patient and surroundings before 
proceeding to the detailed examination, as you must be prepared to accommodate 
for unexpected ﬁ ndings – don ’ t dismiss any clues. 
 2.  ‘This man has ankylosing spondylitis. Please examine him and assess the severity 
of his disease.’ ( Fig. 16.80 ) 
 Figure 16.80   Ankylosing spondylitis. Note the occiput-to-wall distance.

 Method 
 •  Look 
 1.  Th e initial inspection confi rms that this is a case of ankylosing spondylitis ( Table 
16.46 ). Ask the patient to undress to his underpants and stand up. 
 2.  Look for deformity, inspecting from both the back and the side, particularly looking 
for kyphosis and loss of lumbar lordosis. 
 •  Feel 
 1.  Palpate each vertebral body for tenderness and palpate for muscle spasm. 
 •  Test function 
 1.  Measure the fi nger–fl oor distance (inability to touch the toes suggests early lumbar 
disease).

 2.  Next, look at extension, lateral fl exion and rotation of the back. Get the patient 
to run each hand down the corresponding thigh to test lateral fl exion. 
 3.  Ask whether you may perform a modifi ed Schober ’ s test. Th is involves identifying 
the level of the posterior iliac spine on the vertebral body (approximately at L5). 
Place a mark 5 cm below this point and another 10 cm above this point. Ask the 
patient to touch the toes. Th ere should normally be an increase of 5 cm or more 
in the distance between the marks. In ankylosing spondylitis there will be little 
separation of the marks, since all the movement is taking place at the hips. 
 HINT 
 Small adhesive paper or plastic strips are popular as markers; do not mark the patient 
with a pen. 
 HINT 
 It is a good idea to know why testing of occiput-to-wall distance is performed: it is to 
assess progression of the disease at clinic visits. 
 4.  Next test the occiput-to-wall distance. Ask the patient to place his heels and back 
against the wall and ask him to touch the wall with the back of his head without 
raising his chin above the carrying level; inability to touch the wall suggests cervical 
involvement and the distance from occiput to wall is measured. 
 5.  Test for active sacroiliac disease by springing the anterior superior iliac spines. Pain 
felt in the region of the sacroiliac joints suggests activity. A simple (and unreliable) 
test for sacroiliac disease is to push with the heel of the hand on the sacrum and 
note the presence of tenderness in either sacroiliac joint. ( Note: Usually there is 
bilateral disease in ankylosing spondylitis.) 
 6.  Ask the patient to lie on his stomach. Examine the heels for Achilles tendinitis 
and plantar fasciitis, which are characteristic of the spondyloarthropathies. Evaluate 
the other large joints, particularly the knees, hips and shoulders. 
 •  Extra-articular manifestations 
 If there is time, and especially if the patient seems to have been suitably undressed for 
these examinations:
 1.  Examine the chest for decreased lung expansion (chest expansion of less than 3 cm 
at the nipple line suggests early costovertebral involvement) and for signs of apical 
fi brosis (quite rare but you never know what exotic conditions might be found for 
 
 
515
16 • Common short cases
the clinical exams). Examine the heart for aortic regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse 
and evidence of conduction defects (palpate for the presence of implantable defi bril-
lator), and the eyes for uveitis. 
 2.  Examine the gastrointestinal system for evidence of infl ammatory bowel disease and 
for signs of amyloid deposition (e.g. hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal urine analysis 
results). 
 3.  Remember also to check for signs of psoriasis (scalp etc) and reactive arthritis, which 
may cause spondylitis and unilateral sacroiliitis. 
 4.  Rarely, patients with ankylosing spondylitis have a cauda equina compression (see  p. 
517 ). X-ray changes are described in  Table 16.47 and illustrated in  Figs 16.81–16.83 .

 Notes on the neurological short case 
 Th ese examinations are often considered the most diffi  cult short cases. However, when 
done well, they can also be the highest scoring. Th ere are some principles to be kept in 
mind that can help, especially when presenting your fi ndings. Create a framework and 
fi ll this in as you are examining, if possible. For example: 
 ‘I examined Mrs X, who presented with diffi  culty walking. In summary she has a:
 •  Symmetrical / asymmetrical 
 •  Motor / sensory loss 
 •  In a myotomal / dermatomal / stocking distribution 
 •  Aff ecting __ root / up to the level of __ 
 •  With / without an associated __ motor / sensory loss 
 •  Which would be most consistent with a diagnosis of  x 
 •  In further detail …’ 
 A cranial nerve defi cit should point towards localising the lesion, and know your 
stroke syndromes before asking for imaging (see this website as a guide for revision: 
 http://www.strokecenter.org/professionals/stroke-diagnosis/stroke-syndromes/) .
 1.  Common neurological short cases include:
 •  multiple cranial nerve palsies 
 •  pituitary lesions 
 •  cavernous sinus lesions 
 •  Parkinson ’ s disease 
 •  motor neurone disease 
 •  facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 
 •  multiple sclerosis, often with intranuclear ophthalmoplegia 
 •  gait disturbances 
 •  myasthenia gravis. 
 2.  Th e initial inspection is extremely important. 
 3.  Compare left and right sides (‘symmetry is your friend’). 
 4.  Localisation of the lesion is what is required. 
 5.  Th ink as you go along about what you are fi nding. 
 6.  Speak to the patient clearly when you give instructions (but do not appear bossy or 
impatient). 
 
 
518
Examination Medicine
 7.  Th e examiners are often taken in about your profi ciency in general if your testing of 
refl exes looks good. 
 8.  Leave the sensory examination until last. It is the most subjective part of the examination 
and its fi ndings are more easily interpreted when you know what other abnormalities 
are present. 
 Cranial nerves 
 Th ere will usually be some direction from the stem, sometimes to the upper or lower 
cranial nerves. Th e introduction may vary, from a problem with vision, speech or swal-
lowing to a history of neck surgery or trauma. 
 HINT 
 Testing upward gaze in the extreme lateral position will often reveal limitation in normal 
people. 
 Common stems – II, III, IV, VI 
 1.  ‘This man has had problems with diplopia. Please examine his eyes.’ (suggests III, 
IV, VI cranial nerve abnormality, myasthenia gravis or ocular myopathy) 
 2.  ‘This man has had some loss of vision. Please examine his relevant cranial nerves.’ 
(suggests retinal or optic disc problem or ﬁ eld loss) 
 3.  ‘This woman has had blurred vision. Please examine her cranial nerves.’ (consider 
retinopathy) 
 Method 
 1.  Inspect the head and neck briefl y fi rst. Have the patient sit over the edge of the bed 
facing you and look for any craniotomy scars (often well disguised by hair), neu-
rofi bromata, Cushing ’ s syndrome, acromegaly, Paget ’ s disease, facial asymmetry and 
obvious ptosis, proptosis, skew deviation of the eyes or pupil inequality. 
 2.  Look for the characteristic facies of myasthenia gravis or myotonic dystrophy.

 3.  Ask the examiners whether they want you to test smell. Th ey will rarely allow you 
to proceed as it is time-consuming and not usually fruitful in examinations. If you 
are required to test smell, a series of sample bottles will be provided by the examiners 
containing vanilla, coff ee and other non-pungent substances. More recently, commercial 
‘scratch and sniff ’ cards are also available (see  p. 527 for the causes of anosmia).

the other eye with a small card. If you ask the patient to cover the eye with his or 
her hand, make sure it is the palm and not the fi ngers that are used. 4 
 5.  Examine the visual fi elds by confrontation using a red-tipped hatpin, making sure 
your head is level with the patient ’ s head. Explain before each step what it is you 
want the patient to do. 5 A red hatpin enables you to detect earlier peripheral fi eld 
loss. Test each eye separately. If the patient has such poor acuity that a hatpin is 
diffi  cult to use, map the fi elds with your fi ngers. When you are testing the patient ’ s 
right eye, he or she should look straight into your left eye. Th e patient ’ s head should 
be at arm ’ s length and he or she should cover the eye not being tested with a hand. 
Bring the hatpin from the four main directions diagonally towards the centre of the 
fi eld of vision. Ensure the pin stays midway between you and the patient. Apparently 
grossly increased peripheral fi elds suggest you have the pin incorrectly placed. 
 6.  Next map out the blind spot by asking about disappearance of the hatpin lateral to 
the centre of the fi eld of vision of each eye. Only a gross enlargement may be 
detectable by comparison with your own blind spot. 
 7.  While using the red hatpin, ask about colour perception in each eye. Red desaturation 
suggests previous optic neuritis. 
 8.  Look into the fundi (see  Table 16.48 ). You will be provided with a conventional 
not a pan-optic ophthalmoscope.

 THIRD, FOURTH AND SIXTH NERVES 
 9.  Look at the pupils. Note the shape, relative sizes and any associated ptosis. Use your 
pocket torch and shine the light from the side to gauge the reaction to light on both 
sides (normal : constriction). Do not bore the examiners by shining the light repeatedly 
into each eye – practise assessing the direct and consensual responses rapidly. 
 10.  Look for a relative aff erent pupillary defect (RAPD or Marcus Gunn phenomenon). 
Tell the patient ‘I am going to test your pupils. Please look into the distance (at an 
object).’ Move the torch from pupil to pupil. Th e movement should be quick, in 
an arc below the line of sight, though enough time should be allowed at each pupil 
for any constriction or dilatation to occur. Th e aff ected pupil will paradoxically 
dilate after a short time when the torch is moved from a normal eye to one with 
optic atrophy or decreased visual acuity from other causes. Th e test will be abnormal 
even when visual loss is only modest. An RAPD  should be present if loss of acuity 
or colour saturation is present, unless the acuity is purely refractive. 
 11.  Test accommodation by asking the patient to look into the distance and then at 
your red hatpin placed about 15 cm from his or her nose (normally: bilateral 
constriction). 
 12.  Assess eye movements with both eyes fi rst. Ask the patient to look voluntarily and 
quickly from left to right and then to follow the red hatpin in each direction – right 
and left lateral gaze, plus up and down in the central position. Look for failure of 
movement and nystagmus. While doing this, ask about diplopia as subtle ophthal-
moplegia may be diffi  cult to see. If diplopia is present then confi rm that this improves 
if one eye is covered. Test the range of movement of each eye individually if necessary 
and undertake cover–uncover testing to confi rm the paretic eye. If diplopia is variable 
then formally test for fatiguability by asking the patient to maintain gaze in one 
direction (myasthenia). 
 13.  Subtle failure of normal eye movements can be detected by testing saccades (small, 
fast movements). Th e normal eye can move 600° a second, so only small degrees 
(about 7° is enough) of movement should be tested. Hold a fi nger up from one 
hand and a pen in the other – about 6 cm apart. Th en get the patient to:
 a.  look at your fi nger 
 b.  blink twice (to rest the eye) 
 c.  look at your fi nger 
 d.  look quickly at the pen. 
 Watch eye movements for delay in one or both eyes. If the testing is diffi  cult 
because of severe loss of movement (3rd or 6th nerve palsy), test one eye at a time. 
Do this in both horizontal and vertical directions. An undershoot or overshoot with 
a corrective saccade can be seen in cerebellar dysfunction (‘past-pointing of the eyes’). 
 HINT 
 Sometimes reduced eye movement will be detected only when the patient looks quickly 
from one side to the other. 
 HINT 
 Upward gaze is normally limited in elderly patients. 
 14.  Move the patient ’ s head if he or she is unable to follow movements. Beware of 
strabismus. 
 
 
521
16 • Common short cases
 15.  Nystagmus : the pattern of nystagmus, if present, provides substantial information 
regarding the underlying pathology. Nystagmus should have a fast phase (after which 
it is named), and a slow phase (the pathological part).
 HINT 
 Subtle nystagmus is normal at the extremes of gaze. 
 Common stems – V, VII 
 1.  ‘This man has noticed numbness in the face. Please examine his cranial nerves, 
starting with the ﬁ fth.’ 
 2.  ‘This woman has noticed some facial asymmetry, please examine her cranial nerves.’ 
 3.  ‘This man has had difﬁ culty with his speech. Please examine him.’ (Consider dysarthria 
– cranial nerves, cerebellar speech, dysphasia.) 
 HINT 
 When asked to start with a particular cranial nerve, it is best to do just that. The 
instruction is given to help you. It is very common for candidates to ignore the request 
and start a routine cranial nerve examination. 
 •  Cerebellar nystagmus can be unilateral or bilateral. It causes the eye to drift back 
(slow phase) to the centre, with the fast phase in the direction of gaze. It is 
therefore sometimes referred to as ‘gaze-evoked nystagmus’. Other features include 
dysarthria, limb ataxia and hyper- or hypometric saccades. 
 •  Peripheral vestibular nystagmus in acute peripheral vestibulopathies follows 
Alexander ’ s law. It is unidirectional and frequently horizontal, though sometimes 
has a tortional element. It gets worse when the eyes move in the direction of the 
fast phase, and lessens as the eyes are allowed to move towards the direction of 
the slow phase. An abnormal head-impulse test should be present. Th is is performed 
by asking the patient to fi xate on the bridge of your nose and relax his or her 
head. Th e head can then be moved gently from side to side before a few short, 
fast head movements are made towards to the midline. Watch the patient ’ s eyes. 
In a normal patient, the patient should not lose fi xation on the bridge of your 
nose owing to an intact vestibulo-ocular refl ex (VOR). If the vestibular apparatus 
or nerve is disrupted then the eyes move with the head, and a corrective saccade 
can be seen after the head movement. 
 •  Nystagmus can be  monocular and occur in the setting of weakness of the opposite 
eye. Causes include neuropathies of cranial nerves III, IV and VI and internuclear 
ophthalmoplegia. 
 •  Vertical nystagmus suggests a central disorder, and is virtually never peripheral. 
 •  Congenital nystagmus is often dramatic, though the patient does not experience 
a sense of the world jumping. 
 •  Multidirectional nystagmus in a gaze-evoked pattern suggests generalised cerebellar 
dysfunction or more commonly drug toxicity. Anticonvulsants in particular are 
a common cause.

Examination Medicine
 FIFTH NERVE 
 16.  Ask permission fi rst to test the corneal refl exes. You can use cotton wool to touch 
the cornea (not the conjunctiva) gently. A better method is to use a syringe and do 
an air puff  to avoid corneal injury. Warn the patient about what is to happen. Come 
in from the side and do this only once on each side. If the nerve pathways are intact, 
the patient will blink both eyes. Ask whether he or she can actually feel the air (V 
is the sensory component). 
 HINT 
 Corneal reﬂ ex: when there is an ipsilateral seventh nerve palsy, only the contralateral 
eye will blink – sensation is preserved – ask about this (nerve VII is the motor component). 
Also, with an ipsilateral seventh nerve palsy, the eye on the side of the lesion may roll 
superiorly with the corneal stimulus (‘Bell ’ s phenomenon’). 
 HINT 
 A medullary or upper cervical lesion of the ﬁ fth nerve causes loss of pain and temperature 
sensation with preservation of light touch. A pontine lesion may cause loss of light 
touch with preservation of pain and temperature sensation. 
 HINT 
 Occasionally myasthenia affects the facial muscles. If you suspect myasthenia because 
of eye signs it might be worth testing for the  transverse smile sign. Weakness of the 
levator muscles of the mouth makes an attempt at prolonged smiling look more like 
a grimace. 
 17.  Test facial sensation in the three divisions: ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular. 
Use a neurotip fi rst to assess pain. Map out any area of sensory loss from dull to 
sharp and check for any loss on the posterior part of the head (C2) and neck (C3). 
Light touch must be tested also, as there may be some sensory dissociation. 
 18.  Examine the motor division by asking the patient to clench his or her teeth (feeling 
the masseter muscles) and open the mouth; the pterygoid muscles will not allow 
you to force it closed if the nerve is intact. A unilateral lesion causes the jaw to 
deviate towards the weak (aff ected) side. 
 19.  Always test the jaw jerk (with the mouth just open, the fi nger over the jaw is tapped 
with a tendon hammer). An increased jaw jerk occurs in pseudobulbar palsy. It may 
be absent in health. 
 SEVENTH NERVE 
 20.  Look for facial asymmetry and then test the muscles of facial expression. Ask the 
patient to look up and wrinkle the forehead. Look for loss of wrinkling and feel the 
muscle strength by pushing down on each side. Th is is preserved in an upper motor 
neurone lesion because of bilateral cortical representation of these muscles. 
 21.  Next, ask the patient to tightly shut the eyes – compare how deeply the eyelashes 
are buried on the two sides and then try to open each eye. Ask the patient to grin, 
and compare the nasolabial grooves. 
 
 
523
16 • Common short cases
 22.  If a lower motor neurone lesion is detected, quickly check for ear and palatal vesicles 
of herpes zoster of the geniculate ganglion – the Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Examining 
for taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is not usually required. 
 Common stem – VIII 
 ‘This woman has noticed some hearing loss. Please examine her cranial nerves.’ 
 EIGHTH NERVE 
 23.  Whisper a number softly about 0.5 m away from each ear and ask the patient to 
repeat the number. 
 An alternative method is to rustle your fi ngers together starting next to the ear 
and moving away. Ask the patient to tell you when they can no longer hear it. 
Compare the distance for each ear. Th is method allows you to compare relative 
hearing loss, not just a positive or negative result. It is no less arbitrary than whispering 
a number, and has the added advantage of being a good visual descriptor for those 
watching. 
 Perform Rinne ’ s and Weber ’ s tests with a 256 Hz tuning fork. 
 Always ask for an auriscope (wax is the most common cause of conductive 
deafness). 
 HINT 
 Look carefully for scars behind the ear. Surgery may have been performed for excision 
of a tumour (e.g. an acoustic neuroma). 
 Common stem – IX, X, XI, XII 
 ‘This man has noticed he has a hoarse voice. Please examine his lower cranial nerves.’ 
 NINTH AND TENTH NERVES 
 25.  Look at the palate and note any uvular displacement. Ask the patient to say ‘aaah’ 
and look for asymmetrical movement of the soft palate. When there is a unilateral 
tenth nerve lesion, the uvula is drawn towards the unaff ected (normal) side. 
 26.  Testing the gag refl ex is traditional, but adds little to the examination. Ask if you 
may do this and warn the patient if you are given the go-ahead. 
 If the palate moves normally and the patient can feel the spatula, the same 
information is obtained (the ninth nerve is the sensory component and the tenth 
nerve the motor component): touch the back of the pharynx on each side. Remember 
to ask the patient whether he or she feels the spatula each time. You may not attain 
top marks if the patient vomits all over the examiners. If the spatula is used correctly, 
the patient will gag only if the refl ex is hyperactive. 
 24.  Th e assessment of the vestibular portion of this nerve is typically done with eye 
assessment. However, if hearing loss is unilateral then assessment with a head-impulse 
test is critical. (Th is is covered above under ‘Nystagmus’.) 
 
 
524
Examination Medicine
 27.  Ask the patient to speak (to assess hoarseness) and to cough (listen for a bovine cough, 
which may occur with a recurrent laryngeal nerve lesion).  Note: You will not usually 
be required to test taste on the posterior third of the tongue (i.e. ninth nerve). 
 ELEVENTH NERVE 
 28.  Ask the patient to shrug his or her shoulders and then feel the trapezius bulk and 
push the shoulders down. Th en instruct the patient to turn the head against resistance 
(your hand) and also feel the muscle bulk and note any sternocleidomastoid wasting 
( Fig. 16.84 ). 
 TWELFTH NERVE 
 29.  While examining the mouth for cranial nerves IX and X, inspect the tongue for 
wasting and fasciculation (which may be unilateral or bilateral, and is best seen with 
the tongue not protruded). 
 Figure 16.84   Left-sided sternocleidomastoid wasting.  
 HINT 
 Take time to inspect the tongue. Fasciculations and wasting are easily missed but are 
very important in the diagnosis of a lower motor neurone twelfth nerve palsy. 
 30.  Th en ask the patient to protrude the tongue. Look again for fasciculation and 
wasting. With a unilateral lesion it deviates towards the weaker (aff ected) side. 
 31.  Th e way to fi nish your assessment depends entirely on your fi ndings. For example, 
if you discover evidence of a particular syndrome (such as lateral medullary syndrome), 
you should proceed to confi rm your impressions by examining more peripherally, 
if allowed (looking especially for sensory long tract and cerebellar signs; see below).

 HINT 
 If you have discovered multiple lower cranial nerve palsies, you would want to assess, 
among other features, the nasopharynx for signs of tumour and the neck for scars and 
radiotherapy changes. 
 32.  Auscultating for carotid or cranial bruits (over the mastoids, temples and orbits), as 
well as taking the blood pressure and testing the urine for sugar, are relevant. 
 Relevant investigations are likely to be CT or MRI scans. Th ese are not always easy 
for physicians to report. Candidates would hope to have a good idea where in the brain 
or the spinal cord the abnormality is likely to be present. Only scans with quite obvious 
abnormalities ( Fig. 16.85 ) are likely to be used for the exam (because the examiners 
are otherwise more likely than not to have little idea of where the abnormality is). 
 Eyes 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This man has noticed loss of vision. Please examine his eyes.’ 
 2.  ‘This woman is a diabetic. Please examine her eyes.’ 
 3.  ‘Please examine this man ’ s eyes.’ (This is a deliberately vague stem, sometimes 
used when there is a speciﬁ c ocular ﬁ nding or something that should be obvious 
from inspection and would guide your exam.) 
 
 
526
Examination Medicine
 Method ( Table 16.48 ) 
 1.  Always inspect the eyes fi rst, with the patient sitting over the end of the bed facing 
you at eye level if possible. Note any corneal abnormalities, such as band keratopathy 
(in hypercalcaemic states) or Kayser–Fleischer rings (Wilson ’ s disease). Look at the 
sclerae for colour (e.g. jaundice, blue in osteogenesis imperfecta), pallor, injection 
and telangiectasia. Inspect carefully for subtle ptosis or strabismus. Look for exoph-
thalmos from behind and above the patient, as well as in front. 
 2.  Proceed then as for the cranial nerve eye examination, testing acuity, fi elds and pupils, 
and then performing fundoscopy. 
 3.  You must do fundoscopy in this case. Begin by examining the cornea and lens, and 
then the retina. Note any corneal, lens or humour abnormalities. Look for retinal 
changes of diabetes mellitus (see  Table 16.43 ) and hypertension (see  Table 16.7 ). 
Also carefully inspect for optic atrophy, papilloedema, angioid streaks (see  p. 484 ), 
retinal detachment, central vein or artery thrombosis and retinitis pigmentosa. 
 4.  Test eye movements. Also, look for fatiguability of eye muscles by asking the patient 
to look up at your hatpin for half a minute (myasthenia gravis). Alternatively ask the 
patient to close the eyes tightly; if positive (the peek sign), within 30 seconds the lid 
margin will begin to separate, showing the sclera. Test for lid lag if you suspect 
hyperthyroidism. 
 5.  Test the corneal refl ex using a syringe with air (ask the examiners fi rst and warn the 
patient). 
 6.  Palpate the orbits for tenderness and auscultate the eyes with the bell of the stethoscope 
(the eye being tested is shut, the other is open and the patient is asked to stop breathing). 
 7.  Do not forget that the patient may have a glass eye. Suspect this if visual acuity is 
zero in one eye and no pupillary reaction is apparent. Lengthy attempts to examine 
the fundus of a glass eye are embarrassing (and not uncommon). 
 One-and-a-half syndrome 
 Th is is rare but important to recognise. Th ese patients have a horizontal gaze palsy when 
looking to one side (the ‘one’) plus impaired adduction on looking to the other side 
(the ‘and-a-half ’). Other features often include turning out (exotropia) of the eye opposite 
the side of the lesion (paralytic pontine exotropia). 
 When combined with a lesion of the fascicle of the ipsilateral facial nerve, causing a 
lower motor neurone facial weakness, it is termed the ‘eight-and-a-half syndrome’ (seven 
plus one-and-a-half). 
 Th e one-and-a-half syndrome can be caused by a stroke (infarct), plaque of multiple 
sclerosis or tumour in the dorsal pons. Once you have completed the task in the stem, 
focus your examination onto demonstrating other features of this diff erential diagnosis, 
including searching for other features of MS (e.g. spastic paraparesis). 
 Horner ’ s syndrome 
 If you fi nd a partial ptosis and a constricted pupil (which reacts normally to light), 
Horner ’ s syndrome is likely ( Fig. 16.86 ,  Table 16.49 ). 
 Proceed as follows.
 1.  Test for a diff erence in sweating over each brow with the back of your fi nger (even 
though your brow is usually more sweaty than the patient ’ s); this occurs only when 
the lesion is proximal to the carotid bifurcation.  Note: Absence of sweating diff erences 
does not exclude the diagnosis of Horner ’ s syndrome.

 4.  Brain stem lesions – vascular disease (especially the lateral medullary syndrome), syringobulbia, 
tumour 
 5.  Retro-orbital lesions 
 6.  Syringomyelia (rare) 
 2.  Next, examine the appropriate cranial nerves to exclude the lateral medullary syndrome:
 a.  nystagmus (to the side of the lesion) 
 b.  ipsilateral fi fth (pain and temperature), ninth and tenth cranial nerve lesions 
 c.  ipsilateral cerebellar signs 
 d.  contralateral pain and temperature loss over the trunk and limbs. 
 3.  Ask the patient to speak and note any hoarseness (which may be caused by recurrent 
laryngeal nerve palsy from a chest lesion or a cranial nerve lesion). 
 4.  Look at the hands for clubbing. Test fi nger abduction to screen for a lower trunk 
brachial plexus (C8, T1) lesion. 
 5.  If there are signs of hoarseness or a lower trunk brachial plexus lesion, proceed to a 
respiratory examination, concentrating on the apices for signs of lung carcinoma. 
 6.  Examine the neck for lymphadenopathy, thyroid carcinoma and a carotid aneurysm 
or bruit (e.g. fi bromuscular dysplasia causing dissection). 
 7.  As syringomyelia may rarely cause this syndrome, fi nish off  the assessment by examining 
for dissociated sensory loss. Remember, this lesion may cause a  bilateral Horner ’ s 
syndrome (a trap for the unwary).

 LIGHT REFLEX 
 Constriction of the pupil in response to light is relayed via the optic nerve and tract, 
the superior quadrigeminal brachium, the Edinger–Westphal nucleus and its eff erent 
parasympathetic fi bres, which terminate in the ciliary ganglion. Th ere is no cortical 
involvement. 
 ACCOMMODATION REFLEX 
 Constriction of the pupil with accommodation originates in the cortex (in association 
with convergence) and is relayed via parasympathetic fi bres in the third nerve.

 CAUSES OF PTOSIS 
 1.  With normal pupils:
 a.  senile ptosis (common) 
 b.  myotonic dystrophy 
 c.  facioscapulohumeral dystrophy 
 d.  ocular myopathy, e.g. mitochondial myopathy 
 e.  thyrotoxic myopathy 
 f.  myasthenia gravis 
 g.  botulism, snake bite 
 h.  congenital 
 i.  fatigue. 
 2.  With constricted pupils:
 a.  Horner ’ s syndrome 
 b.  tabes dorsalis. 
 3.  With dilated pupils: third nerve lesion. 
 Third (oculomotor) nerve ( p. 520 ) 
 HINT 
 When a patient has diplopia, ptosis and eye movement abnormalities not explained by 
cranial nerve problems, consider an ocular myopathy (e.g. mitochondrial myopathy). 
Unlike in myasthenia patients, these do not worsen with repetition or maintenance. 
 CLINICAL FEATURES OF A THIRD NERVE PALSY ( FIG. 16.90 ) 
 1.  Complete ptosis (partial ptosis may occur with an incomplete lesion). 
 2.  Divergent strabismus (eye ‘down and out’). 
 3.  Dilated pupil unreactive to direct or consensual light and unreactive to accommodation. 
 HINT 
 Always exclude a fourth (trochlear) nerve lesion when a third nerve lesion is present. 
Do this by tilting the patient ’ s head to the same side as the lesion. The affected eye 
will intort if the fourth nerve is intact. Or ask the patient to look down and across to 
the opposite side from the lesion and look for intorsion. Remember  SIN : 
 S uperior (oblique muscle), supplied by the IV nerve,  IN torts the eye

 CAUSES OF NYSTAGMUS 
 Jerky 
 1.  Horizontal:
 a.  vestibular lesion ( Note: Nystagmus is horizontal, with fast phase away from the 
side of the side of the lesion. Obeys Alexander ’ s law.) 
 b.  cerebellar lesion ( Note: Unilateral disease causes nystagmus to the side of the lesion. 
Drift is towards the midline with fast phase in direction of gaze.) 
 c.  internuclear ophthalmoplegia ( Fig. 16.91 ). ( Note: Nystagmus is in the abducting 
eye, with failure of adduction on the aff ected side. Th is is a result of a medial 
longitudinal fasciculus lesion. Th e most common cause in young adults with bilateral 
involvement is multiple sclerosis; in the elderly, consider brain stem infarction. 
When the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the abducens nucleus on the same 
side are aff ected, the only complete horizontal movement the patient can make is 
abduction of the contralateral eye –  one-and-a-half syndrome .)

 SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY 
 Loss of vertical upward and / or downward gaze. (Isolated impairment of upward gaze

 The tines of the fork should be in line with the external auditory canal, so that the sound 
waves that leave the fork from two axes do not cancel each other out. 
 Eighth (vestibulo-cochlear) nerve ( p. 523 ) 
 A careful assessment of eye movements followed by the head-impulse test and gait 
assessment allow clinical assessment of vestibular function. Th e Dix–Hallpike test is 
useful in the clinical setting of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) but, 
although this element is clinically relevant, it is best grouped with ocular examination 
in the short case. 
 To diff erentiate nerve deafness from conductive deafness, use the following tests. 
 RINNE ’ S TEST 
 A 256 Hz vibrating tuning fork is placed fi rst on the mastoid process, behind the ear, 
then, when the sound is no longer heard, in line with the external meatus. 
 Results 
 1.  Normal – the note is audible at the external meatus. 
 2.  Nerve deafness – the note is audible at the external meatus because air and bone 
conduction are reduced equally, so that air conduction is better (as is normal): positive 
result. Remember however that a severely deaf patient will not hear the tuning fork 
at all. 
 3.  Conduction (middle ear) deafness – no note is audible at the external meatus: negative 
result. 
 WEBER ’ S TEST 
 A 256 Hz tuning fork is placed on the centre of the forehead. 
 Results 
 1.  Normal – the sound is heard in the centre of the forehead. 
 2.  Nerve deafness – the sound is transmitted to the normal ear. 
 3.  Conduction deafness – the sound is heard louder in the abnormal ear.

16 • Common short cases
 Note: Although these tests are of traditional importance, they are not very accurate 
and are now rarely used by neurologists. However, candidates must be able to perform 
them. Vestibular dysfunction  does frequently present to the emergency department, 
though not to the examinations, and the ability to perform a head-impulse test is critical 
to assessment of vestibular function. 
 CAUSES OF DEAFNESS 
 1.  Nerve (sensorineural) deafness:
 a.  degeneration (e.g. presbycusis) 
 b.  trauma (e.g. high noise exposure, fracture of the petrous temporal bone) 
 c.  toxic (e.g. aspirin, alcohol, streptomycin)

 f.  fracture or tumour of the base of the skull. 
 HINT 
 The Arnold–Chiari malformation is a protrusion of the cerebellar tonsils through the 
foramen magnum. The more severe types (II–IV) cause basilar compression with lower 
cranial nerve palsies, cerebellar limb signs (due to tonsillar compression) and upper 
motor neurone signs in the legs.

 Common stems 
 1.  ‘Please examine this man ’ s higher centres.’ 
 2.  ‘This woman has had some problems with comprehension. Please examine her 
speech and higher centres.’ 
 3.  ‘This woman has had difﬁ culty in writing. Please examine her higher centres.’ 
 Method ( Table 16.51 ) 
 In this assessment especially, you must be guided by your fi ndings. Th e introduction is 
important. For example, if you are told the patient also presents with right-sided weakness, 
you should concentrate on looking for dominant parietal lobe signs.
 1.  Shake the patient ’ s hand, noting any obvious focal weakness and introduce yourself. 
Explain that you will be asking him or her some questions. 
 2.  Examine speech systematically as outlined in  Table 16.52 . 
 3.  Next, assess the parietal lobes. Begin with the dominant parietal lobe, as Gerstmann ’ s 
syndrome is common in examinations. 
 HINT 
 Dominant parietal lobe evaluation: using the mnemonic AALF, examine for:
 A calculia (test mental arithmetic) 
 A graphia (test for an inability to write) 
 L eft–right disorientation (e.g. by asking the patient to put his or her right palm on the 
left ear, then vice versa) 
 F inger agnosia (inability to name individual ﬁ ngers), which is caused by a left angular 
gyrus lesion in right-handed and about half of left-handed patients 
 4.  Test general parietal functions (involving either lobe). Examine for sensory and visual 
inattention. Neglect and extinction tend to be more profound and persistent in 
non-dominant lesions. Also, test for agraphaesthesia (inability to appreciate numbers 
drawn on the palm) and astereognosis (inability to name objects placed in the hand). 
Assess constructional apraxia by asking the patient to draw a clock face and fi ll in 
the numbers. 
 5.  Th e major specifi c non-dominant parietal dysfunction is dressing apraxia. Th is can 
be tested by turning the patient ’ s pyjama top inside out and asking him or her to 
put it on correctly. 
 6.  Assess memory, both short and long term. Th is is a medial temporal lobe function. 
Ask the patient to remember the name of three words of diff erent groups (e.g. 
Brown, Tulip and Bicycle – choose some memorable to you) and repeat them 
immediately. Th en assess long-term memory, such as by asking when World War II 
fi nished. Ask the names of the items again at the end of your higher centres’ examina-
tion (remembering to do so can be diffi  cult). If the patient cannot remember the

Distinguishing whether the words can be correctly selected may help to separate

in a hesitant shuffl  ing gait with freezing). 
 8.  If there is evidence of a frontal lobe lesion, look at the fundi to exclude the rare 
Foster Kennedy syndrome (optic atrophy on the side of the lesion and papilloedema 
in the opposite fundus). 
 9.  Any abnormality of the parietal, temporal or occipital lobes may cause a characteristic 
visual fi eld loss. Th is should be tested, if appropriate, at the conclusion of your 
examination. Other important signs to look for are carotid bruits, hypertension and 
relevant focal neurological signs. 
 10.  MRI and CT scans may show cerebral atrophy consistent with dementia ( Fig. 16.94 ), 
or sometimes a space-occupying lesion.

 HINT 
 Remember to keep your instructions simple and concise. The longer and more complex 
your instruction, the easier it is for the patient to become confused. 
 Method 
 Take careful note of the stem as this may direct you. Th e fi rst stem requires some initial 
assessment before choosing a path, whereas the second stem specifi cally indicates that 
language needs to be assessed. 
 Remember, if a patient does not hear you, cannot speak your language or does not 
understand you then the result will be the same: you will get nowhere. Th erefore, when 
assessing language it is critical to follow a sequence that ensures you have established 
that the patient can understand and then process your instructions. If you do not follow 
an appropriate sequence it is very likely you will come to incorrect conclusions.

545

 2.  Next, assess repetition (i.e. conductive aphasia, arcuate fasciculus). Th is also allows 
an initial assessment for dysarthria. Again, start simple and move to the more complex. 
‘Say what I say’ is a good fi rst instruction as it is simple. Phrases may include ‘blue 
sky’, ‘we went to the circus and had a good time’ or ‘the orchestra played and the 
audience applauded’, ‘hippopotamus’ and fi nally ‘no ifs, ands or buts’. 
 3.  Th en test naming function (nominal, parietal/temporal lobe). Th e same principle of 
simple to complex (low-frequency words) applies, for example naming parts of the 
‘hand’ – e.g. ‘thumb’, then ‘ring fi nger’; if they say just ‘fi nger’, ask which one. 
‘Knuckles’ is a low-frequency, harder word. Or ask about the parts of a ‘shirt’ – ‘collar’, 
‘sleeve’ and ‘cuff ’ in order of increasing diffi  culty. 
 4.  If the patient can complete these tests, then speech can be assessed more freely. Ask 
about the patient ’ s handedness, and test orientation if you have not yet done so. Ask 
him or her to describe a picture. Th e examination room rarely has distinguishing 
features worth describing. Check that the patient is not neglecting part of the image, 
while listening to speech for fl uency and errors. 
 5.  Th e sequence from here on will depend upon your fi ndings. If dysphasia is the fi nding, 
check for other parietal features as well as limb strength and visual fi elds. If the patient 
has dysarthria or dysphonia, proceed to examining the lower cranial nerves. 
 DYSPHASIA 
 1.  If reception is severely impaired then further language assessment is very challenging. 
Consider giving written instructions to see whether the patient can comprehend 
them. Patients with impaired reception may generate fl uent but content-poor speech, 
with many conjunctions but few verbs and nouns. Th ey may be oblivious to the fact 
they are speaking nonsense. 
 2.  If the speech is fl uent but conveys information imperfectly, often with paraphasic 
errors (e.g. ‘treen’ for train – substitution of a word of similar sound – a phone-
mic error; ‘bed’ for chair – an error relating to identity of the word – a semantic 
error), the main possibilities are nominal and receptive dysphasia. Test for these 
by asking the patient to name objects, to repeat a statement after you and then 
follow commands. Th en ask him or her to read and write if the above are abnormal 
(see  Table 16.52 ). 
 3.  If the speech is slow and non-fl uent (hesitant), exactly the same procedure is followed, 
but an expressive dysphasia is likely. At the end, ask to assess for a hemiparesis (see 
 Table 16.52 ). 
 4.  Remember, large lesions may cause global aphasia, with inability to comprehend or 
speak, plus hemiparesis ( Table 16.53 ).

 5.  Aim to perform a speech exam in 4 minutes. If you have time, try to elucidate the 
risk factors and aetiology for the lesions found. For instance, if your examination 
reveals a vascular territory cerebral lesion, check the patient ’ s heart rate for atrial 
fi brillation, blood pressure, carotid bruits and previous carotid surgery, signs of diabetes 
mellitus or hypercholesterolaemia. Remember to ask for relevant investigations such 
as an ECG or HbA 1c . 
 DYSARTHRIA 
 1.  Th is is a disorder of articulation with no disorder of the content of speech. Consider 
cerebellar disease and lower cranial nerve lesions particularly. Cerebellar speech is 
slurred or ‘scanning’ (i.e. irregular and staccato). Pseudobulbar palsy causes slow, 
hesitant, hollow-sounding speech with a harsh, strained voice, whereas bulbar palsy 
causes nasal speech with imprecise articulation. In motor neurone disease there may 
be mixed signs of bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy. 
 2.  Ask the patient to say ‘Hippopotamus’, ‘Constitution’, ‘Me Me Me’ and ‘Lah Lah 
Lah’. 
 3.  If the speech is cerebellar, go on to this system ( p. 572 ). 
 4.  If palsy of a lower cranial nerve is likely, examine the lower cranial nerves carefully. 
 5.  Do not forget to elicit the jaw jerk. Look in the mouth too for ulceration or other 
local lesions. 
 6.  Less common causes of dysarthria include extrapyramidal disease and myopathies 
( p. 566 ). 
 DYSPHONIA 
 Th is is huskiness of the voice from a laryngeal disorder, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy 
or focal dystonia. If this is found, assess the quality of the cough too. 
 Upper limbs 
 HINT 
 If told someone has trouble combing her hair, ask the patient to attempt to reach the 
back of her head with her hands. Possible causes include proximal muscle weakness 
(myopathic or upper motor neurone) and arthritis of the shoulder and occasionally 
elbow. Also consider the possibility of scapular winging, which you will miss if the arms 
are elevated to only 90°. 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This man has noticed weakness in his arms. Please examine him.’ 
 2.  ‘This woman has had difﬁ culty combing her hair. Please examine her upper limbs.’ 
 Method ( Table 16.54 ) 
 1.  Look at the whole patient briefl y. Note particularly evidence of a muscle wasting, a 
myopathic face, Parkinsonian features or stroke. 
 2.  Shake the patient ’ s hand fi rmly and introduce yourself. If he or she cannot let go, 
you have made the diagnosis: myotonia (usually caused by dystrophia myotonica). 
Ask the patient to sit over the side of the bed facing you.

 MOTOR SYSTEM 
 Examine the motor system systematically every time.
 1.  Inspect fi rst for wasting (both proximally and distally) and fasciculations. Do not 
forget to include the shoulder girdle in your inspection ( p. 550 ). 
 2.  Ask the patient to hold both hands out with the arms extended and to close the eyes. 
Look for drifting of one or both arms. Th ere are only three causes for this drift:
 a.  upper motor neurone weakness (usually downwards, owing to muscle weakness) 
 b.  cerebellar lesion (usually upwards, owing to hypotonia) 
 c.  posterior column loss (any direction, owing to loss of joint position sense). 
 3.  Also note any tremor and pseudoathetosis resulting from proprioceptive loss. 
 4.  Feel the muscle bulk next, both proximally and distally, and note any muscle tenderness. 
In the presence of wasting and weakness, fasciculation indicates lower motor neurone 
degeneration. 
 5.  Test tone at the wrists and elbows by moving the joints at varying velocities. 
 6.  Assess power next. Demonstrating the movement helps the patient to perform it 
correctly.
 a.  Shoulder:
 i.  abduction (C5, C6): tell the patient to abduct the arms with the elbows fl exed 
and push up 
 ii.  adduction (C6–C8): tell the patient to adduct the arms with the elbows fl exed 
and push in. 
 
 
548
Examination Medicine
 b.  Elbow:
 i.  fl exion (C5, C6): tell the patient to bend the elbow and pull in 
 ii.  extension (C7, C8): tell the patient to bend the elbow and push away. 
 c.  Wrist:
 i.  fl exion (C6, C7): tell the patient to bend the wrist and not to let you straighten it 
 ii.  extension (C7, C8): tell the patient to straighten the wrist and not to let you 
bend it. 
 d.  Fingers:
 i.  extension (C7, C8): tell the patient to straighten the fi ngers and keep them 
straight 
 ii.  fl exion (C7, C8): tell the patient to squeeze two of your fi ngers 
 iii.  abduction (C8, T1): tell the patient to spread out the fi ngers and not to let 
you push them together 
 iv.  Grade the power ( p. 554 ). 
 7.  Test for an ulnar lesion (loss of fi nger abduction and adduction) and a median nerve 
lesion (loss of thumb abduction) ( p. 559 ). 
 8.  Examine the refl exes:
 a.  biceps (C5, C6) – biceps muscle 
 b.  triceps (C7, C8) – triceps muscle 
 c.  supinator (C5, C6) – brachioradialis muscle (elbow fl exion) 
 Note: An inverted supinator jerk – when tapping the lower end of the radius, 
elbow extension and fi nger fl exion are the only response; associated with an absent 
biceps and exaggerated triceps jerk this indicates an intraspinal lesion compressing 
the spinal cord and nerve roots at C5, C6 
 d.  Hoff man ’ s refl ex (C8) – fl ick the distal phalanx of the middle fi nger towards 
extension with the hand resting in a neutral position. A resulting fl exion of the 
thumb indicates pathologically increased refl exes. 
 9.  Assess coordination with fi nger–nose testing and look for dysdiadochokinesis and 
rebound ( p. 573 ). Ensure, if testing rebound, that the patient is well supported and 
does not fall over. 
 Motor weakness can be caused by an upper motor neurone lesion, lower motor 
neurone lesion, neuromuscular junction disorder or myopathy. If there is evidence of a 
lower motor neurone lesion, consider anterior horn cell, nerve root and brachial plexus 
lesions, peripheral nerve lesions or a motor peripheral neuropathy. 
 SENSORY SYSTEM 
 Examine the sensory system after motor testing because this can be time-consuming 
(and confusing, even when assessed by experts). Less is more in sensation: over-zealous 
demarcation is seldom helpful and may be painful for the patient.
 1.  First, test the spinothalamic pathway (pain and temperature). Use the metal of a 
tuning fork to test cold, starting distally and moving proximally to detect a gradient 
or level. Temperature sensation is more specifi c than pain sensation, and less unpleasant 
to the patient. 
 2.  To test pain, use a new blunt neurology pin. One candidate accidentally pricked his 
own fi nger during the examination with a sharp pin. By the time he stopped bleeding 
his short-case time was up. (In case you believe this might be a good ploy, the candidate 
failed.) Once again, move reasonably rapidly from distal to proximal. Avoid testing 
grossly oedematous legs with a pin. (Oedema fl uid may leak everywhere). When 
using a tip with a sharp and a blunt end, there is seldom a good reason to use the 
blunt end; it will likely simply confuse you. 
 
 
549
16 • Common short cases
 As you are assessing, try to fi t any sensory loss into dermatomal (cord or nerve root 
lesion) ( Fig. 16.95 ), peripheral nerve, peripheral neuropathy (glove) or hemisensory 
(cortical or cord) distribution. Also, remember that ‘cape’ sensory loss (neck, shoulders 
and arms) suggests syringomyelia, whereas ‘shield’ sensory loss (front of the chest) 
may occur with syphilis. 
 3.  Next, test the posterior column pathway (vibration and proprioception). Use a 128 Hz 
tuning fork to assess vibration sense. Place this when vibrating on the nail bed of a 
fi nger when the patient has the eyes closed and ask whether he or she can feel it. If 
so, ask the patient to tell you when the vibration ceases and then stop the vibration. 
If the patient has defi cient sensation, test at the ulnar head at the wrist, the elbow, 
and then the shoulder. Test both arms. Quantitative tuning forks are available, but 
unnecessary for short-case examinations. 
 4.  Examine proprioception fi rst with the DIP joint of the index fi nger. When the patient 
has the eyes open, grasp the distal phalanx from the sides and move it up and down 
to demonstrate, then ask him or her to close the eyes and repeat the manoeuvres. 
Start with large movements (to get the patient familiar with what you ’ re asking) then 
test small movements. Normally, movement through even a few degrees is detectable 
(but this ability declines with age) and the patient can tell whether it is up or down. 
If there is any abnormality, proceed to test the wrist and elbows similarly.

 Proprioceptive loss may be subtle. A normal person can detect movement and usually 
directional changes of 1°–2°. Ensure that you test small joint movements.

Examination Medicine
 5.  Light touch may be tested, but this is seldom useful if other modalities are examined properly. 
Test it with cotton-wool. Touch the skin lightly in each dermatome. Do  not stroke. 
 6.  Feel for thickened nerves – ulnar at the elbow, median at the wrist and radial at the 
wrist – and feel the axillae if there is evidence of a plexus lesion. Do not forget to mention 
any scars that may be present. Finally, examine the neck movements, if relevant, and 
look for surgical scars in the front and back of the neck and in the axillae. 
 7.  To confi rm a diagnosis, it may be necessary to examine further afi eld. Ask the examiners 
whether you can do this. For example, if there is evidence of motor neurone disease, assess 
the lower limbs as well as the tongue. If there is evidence of a C5, C6 root lesion, assess 
the lower limbs for an upper motor neurone lesion and the neck for cervical spondylosis. 
 Shoulder girdle examination

 This introduction is often used for facioscapulohumeral (FSH) muscular dystrophy. A 
careful inspection of the face from a distance will reveal wasting of the masseter and

and the presence of a urinary catheter. Look for pes cavus. Look around the room 
for a walking stick or frame and special shoes.

across the room, turn around and walk back. If the patient appears to be in diffi  culty, 
ask the bulldog to help. Ask him or her (the patient, not the bulldog) to try heel-to-toe 
walking (for cerebellar disease) and then try standing and then walking on toes and 
heels (for an S1 or L4 / L5 lesion, respectively), and to squat and stand (for proximal 
myopathy). Perform Romberg ’ s test for ataxia before asking the patient to walk. Th e 
test is positive if the patient sways more when the eyes are closed – loss of visual 
clues makes the patient with proprioceptive loss more unsteady. 
 HINT 
 Speciﬁ c testing of gait should help you decide whether there is an ataxic or high-stepping 
gait (cerebellar or proprioceptive problems) or muscle weakness (proximal or distal, 
or both). 
 Romberg ’ s test helps you decide if the problem is due to proprioceptive loss or is 
cerebellar in origin. 
 3.  Have the patient lie on the bed with the legs entirely exposed. Place a towel over 
the groin. Look at the patient ’ s back for scars. 
 4.  Look for muscle wasting and fasciculation. Note any tremor. Feel the muscle bulk 
of the quadriceps and run your hand up each shin, feeling for wasting of the anterior 
tibial muscles. 
 5.  Test tone at the knees and ankles. 
 6.  Test clonus at this time. Warn the patient fi rst. Move the ankle gently to allow 
relaxation before sharply dorsifl exing the foot with the knee bent and the thigh 
externally rotated. Sustained rhythmical contractions indicate an upper motor neurone 
lesion. If there is ankle clonus, test at the knee by pushing the patella sharply 
downwards. Always test both sides! 
 7.  Assess power next.
 a.  Hip:
 i.  fl exion (L2, L3): ask the patient to lift up the straight leg and not let you 
push it down (having placed your hand above the knee) 
 ii.  extension (L5, S1, S2): ask the patient to keep the leg down and not let you 
pull it up 
 iii.  abduction (L4, L5, S1): ask the patient to abduct the legs and not let you 
push them together 
 iv.  adduction (L2, L3, L4): ask the patient to keep the legs adducted and not let 
you pull them apart. 
 b.  Knee:
 i.  fl exion (L5, S1): ask the patient to bend the knee and not let you straighten it 
 ii.  extension (L3, L4): with the patient ’ s knee slightly bent, ask him or her to 
straighten the knee and not let you bend it. 
 c.  Ankle and foot:
 i.  plantar fl exion (S1): ask the patient to push the foot down and not let you 
pull it up 
 ii.  dorsifl exion (L4, L5): ask the patient to bring the foot up and not let you 
push it down 
 iii.  eversion (L5, S1): ask the patient to evert the foot against resistance; loss of 
this may also indicate a common peroneal (lateral popliteal) nerve palsy 
 iv.  inversion (L5): ask the patient to invert the plantarfl exed foot against resistance.

( p. 573 ). 
 10.  Examine the sensory system ( Fig. 16.96 ) as for the upper limbs: pin prick, then

sphincter of the anus to scratching of the perianal skin. 7 
 14.  If you have not done this already, go to the back. Look for deformity, scars and 
neurofi bromata. Palpate for tenderness over the vertebral bodies and auscultate for 
bruits. Test straight leg raising.

nerves.

 Notes on the neurological examination of the limbs 
 Grading muscle power (Medical Research Council) 
 0.  Complete paralysis. 
 1.  Flicker of contraction. 
 2.  Movement with  no gravity. 
 3.  Movement against gravity only (any resistance stops movement). 
 4.  Movement against gravity plus some resistance. 
 5.  Normal power. 
 Th is grading is weighted towards severe weakness (grades 0–3 are all severe). A more 
sensible scale would be the following:
 1.  Complete paralysis. 
 2.  Severe weakness. 
 3.  Moderate weakness. 
 4.  Mild weakness. 
 5.  Normal. 
 Signs of a lower motor neurone lesion 
 1.  Weakness. 
 2.  Wasting. 
 3.  Decreased or absent refl exes. 
 4.  Fasciculation (prominent in anterior horn cell diseases unless far advanced). 
 Signs of an upper motor neurone lesion 
 1.  Weakness in an ‘upper motor neurone pattern’; all muscle groups are weak, but may 
be more marked in upper limb abductor and extensor muscles – shoulder abduction, 
elbow and wrist extensors – and lower limb fl exor muscles – hip fl exion, knee fl exion, 
ankle dorsifl exion. 
 2.  Spasticity. 
 3.  Clonus. 
 4.  Increased refl exes and extensor plantar response. 
 An approach to peripheral neuropathy 
 Th is may be sensory (glove and stocking) or motor, or both. Autonomic nerves may be 
involved – check postural BP if possible. 
 7 Th is will not be allowed, but you may be asked what you would expect to fi nd.

 A burning sensation on the soles of the feet can be caused by a painful peripheral 
neuropathy. Small ﬁ bres may be involved in isolation, so ankle jerks may be preserved. 
Other causes include tarsal tunnel syndrome or an S1 lesion. An S1 lesion will cause 
a decreased or absent ankle jerk.

 HINT 
 Myokymia resembles benign coarse fasciculation of the same muscle group (e.g. eyelids). 
Electromyographic myokymia can occur in multiple sclerosis, brain stem neoplasm, 
Bell ’ s palsy, radiculopathy or radiation plexopathy, or chronic nerve compression. 
 CAUSES OF THICKENED NERVES 
 1.  Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. 
 2.  Acromegaly. 
 3.  Chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. 
 4.  Amyloidosis. 
 5.  Leprosy. 
 6.  Others – sarcoidosis, neurofi bromatosis. 
 CAUSES OF FASCICULATION 
 Fasciculation is  not always motor neurone disease. Causes include:
 1.  benign idiopathic fasciculation (by far the most common, except possibly in the 
exam) 
 2.  motor neurone disease 
 3.  motor root compression 
 4.  malignant neuropathy 
 5.  spinal muscular atrophy / bulbospinal muscular atrophy (Kennedy syndrome) 
 6.  any motor neuropathy (less commonly). 
 Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) 
 Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease ( Figs 16.97 and  16.98 ) is usually autosomal dominant. 
 CLINICAL FEATURES 
 1.  Pes cavus (short, high-arched feet with hammer toes) (see  Fig. 16.97 ). 
 2.  Distal muscle atrophy due to peripheral nerve degeneration, not usually extending 
above the elbows or above the middle one-third of the thighs (see  Fig. 16.98 ). 
 3.  Absent refl exes. 
 4.  Slight to no sensory loss in the limbs (usually). 
 5.  Th ickened nerves. 
 6.  Optic atrophy; Argyll Robertson pupils (rare). 
 An approach to brachial plexus lesions 
 COMPLETE LESION 
 1.  Lower motor neurone signs aff ect the whole arm. 
 2.  Sensory loss (whole limb). 
 3.  Horner ’ s syndrome (see  Fig. 16.86 ) – an important clue, but only if the lesion is 
proximal in the lower plexus.

position. 
 2.  Sensory loss is present over the lateral aspect of the arm and forearm, and over the 
thumb. 
 LOWER TRUNK (KLUMPKE) (C8, T1) LESION 
 1.  True claw hand with paralysis of all the intrinsic muscles. 
 2.  Sensory loss along the ulnar side of the hand and forearm. 
 3.  Horner ’ s syndrome. 
 CERVICAL RIB SYNDROME 
 1.  Weakness and wasting of the small muscles of the hand (true claw hand). 
 2.  Sensory loss over the medial aspect of the hand and forearm. 
 3.  Unequal radial pulses and blood pressures. 
 4.  Subclavian bruit and loss of the pulse on arm manoeuvring (this sign is often also 
present in the normal population). 
 5.  Palpable cervical rib in the neck (uncommon). 
 Important peripheral nerves 
 RADIAL NERVE (C5–C8) LESION 
 Clinical features 
 1.  Wrist and fi nger drop (wrist fl exion normal). 
 2.  Triceps loss (elbow extension loss) if lesion is above the spiral groove. 
 3.  Sensory loss over the anatomical snuff box. 
 4.  Finger abduction  appears to be weak because of the diffi  culty of spreading the fi ngers 
when they cannot be straightened. 
 MEDIAN NERVE (C6–T1) LESION 
 Th is nerve supplies all the muscles on the front of the forearm except for the fl exor 
carpi ulnaris and half of the fl exor digitorum profundus. It also supplies the following 
short muscles of the hand (LOAF):
 L ateral two lumbricals 
 O pponens pollicis 
 A bductor pollicis brevis 
 F lexor pollicis brevis (this sometimes has ulnar innervation). 
 Clinical features 
 1.  Loss of abductor pollicis brevis with a lesion at or above the wrist: pen-touching 
test – with the hand fl at, ask the patient to abduct the thumb vertically to touch 
your pen. 
 2.  Loss of fl exor digitorum sublimis with a lesion in or above the cubital fossa: Ochsner ’ s 
clasping test – ask the patient to clasp the hands fi rmly together; the index fi nger on 
the aff ected side fails to fl ex.

 1.  Wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand (except LOAF muscles). 
 2.  Weak fi nger abduction and adduction (loss of interosseous muscles). 
 3.  Ulnar claw-like hand. ( Note: A higher lesion causes less deformity, as an above-the-elbow 
lesion also causes loss of fl exor digitorum profundus.) 
 4.  Froment ’ s sign: ask the patient to grasp a piece of paper between the thumb and 
lateral aspect of the forefi nger with each hand – the aff ected thumb will fl ex (loss of 
thumb adductor). 
 5.  Sensory loss over the little and medial half of the ring fi nger (both palmar and dorsal 
aspects). 
 WASTING OF THE SMALL MUSCLES OF THE HAND ( FIG. 16.99 )

 HINT 
 When distinguishing an ulnar nerve lesion from a C8 root / lower trunk brachial plexus 
lesion, remember that the sensory loss of a C8 lesion extends proximal to the wrist and 
that the thenar muscles are involved with a C8 root or lower trunk brachial plexus lesion. 
Distinguishing a C8 root from a lower trunk brachial plexus lesion is difﬁ cult clinically, 
but the presence of Horner ’ s syndrome or an axillary mass suggests that the brachial 
plexus is affected. 
 Causes 
 1.  Nerve lesions:
 a.  median and ulnar nerve lesions 
 b.  brachial plexus lesions 
 c.  peripheral motor neuropathy (in the examination, don ’ t forget hereditary motor 
and sensory neuropathy). 
 2.  Anterior horn cell disease:
 a.  motor neurone disease 
 b.  polio 
 c.  spinal muscular atrophies (e.g. Kugelberg–Welander disease). 
 3.  Myopathy:
 a.  dystrophia myotonica – the forearms more aff ected than the hands 
 b.  distal myopathy. 
 4.  Spinal cord lesions:
 a.  syringomyelia 
 b.  cervical spondylosis with compression of the C8 segment 
 c.  other (e.g. tumour). 
 5.  Trophic disorders:
 a.  arthropathies (disuse) 
 b.  ischaemia, including vasculitis 
 c.  shoulder–hand syndrome. 
 FEMORAL NERVE (L2, L3, L4) LESION 
 Clinical features 
 1.  Weakness of knee extension (quadriceps paralysis). 
 2.  Slight hip fl exion weakness. 
 3.  Preserved adductor strength. 
 4.  Loss of knee jerk. 
 5.  Sensory loss involving the inner aspect of the thigh and leg. 
 SCIATIC NERVE (L4, L5, S1, S2) LESION 
 Clinical features 
 1.  Weakness of knee fl exion (hamstrings involved). 
 2.  Loss of power of all muscles below the knee causing a foot drop, so the patient may 
be able to walk, but cannot stand on the toes or heels. 
 3.  Knee jerk intact. 
 4.  Loss of ankle jerk and plantar response. 
 5.  Sensory loss along the posterior thigh and total loss below the knee.

 COMMON PERONEAL (LATERAL POPLITEAL) NERVE (L4, L5, S1) LESION 
 Clinical features 
 1.  Foot drop and loss of foot eversion only. 
 2.  Sensory loss (minimal) over the dorsum of the foot. 
 Note: Th e refl exes are normal. 
 Figure 16.100   Foot drop in 45-year-old patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

 HINT 
 If there is a foot drop (see  Fig. 16.100 ), test foot inversion and eversion.  Inversion of 
the foot will be normal with a peroneal nerve compression but  absent with a L5 radicu-
lopathy. (Eversion is absent with both lesions.) 
 LATERAL CUTANEOUS NERVE OF THE THIGH LESION 
 Meralgia paraesthetica is caused by compression of this nerve, which may result in 
sensory loss or hyperaesthesia over the lateral aspect of the thigh, but no motor loss. 
 CAUSES OF FOOT DROP ( FIG. 16.100 ) 
 1.  Common peroneal nerve palsy. 
 2.  Sciatic nerve palsy. 
 3.  Lumbosacral plexus lesion. 
 4.  L4, L5 root lesion.

16 • Common short cases
 5.  Peripheral motor neuropathy. 
 6.  Distal myopathy. 
 7.  Motor neurone disease. 
 8.  Precentral gyrus lesion. 
 HINT 
 Remember, if there is a foot drop, test the ankle jerk carefully. As a very rough rule of 
thumb, if it is absent then an S1 lesion should be suspected; if it is normal then a 
common peroneal palsy should be considered; if it is increased then an upper motor 
neurone lesion or motor neurone disease is likely. 
 Notes on spinal cord lesions 
 Assessment of the paraplegic patient 
 1.  Is there also a sensory level? Do not forget to continue examining up the torso, 
especially if there is suggestion of a thoracic lesion. Patterns of sensory loss depend 
on the level and type of lesion. Consider:
 a.  cord compression, which causes a loss of all modalities bilaterally below the level 
involved ( note: extrinsic compression may spare the perineum); radicular pain and 
lower motor neurone weakness are present at the level of spinal compression 
 b.  transverse myelitis 
 c.  anterior spinal artery occlusion (posterior column function is spared) 
 d.  intrinsic cord lesion 
 e.  multiple sclerosis. 
 2.  Back examination: for example, deformity, tenderness or bruits may provide clues 
about the underlying disease process. 
 3.  Arm involvement? Consider:
 a.  cervical spondylosis 
 b.  syringomyelia 
 c.  motor neurone disease 
 d.  multiple sclerosis. 
 4.  Cranial nerve lesions? Consider:
 a.  motor neurone disease 
 b.  multiple sclerosis. 
 5.  Peripheral neuropathy? Consider:
 a.  vitamin B 12 defi ciency 
 b.  Friedreich ’ s ataxia 
 c.  carcinoma 
 d.  hereditary spastic paraplegia 
 e.  syphilis. 
 HINT 
 Intracranial lesions (e.g. parasagittal meningioma) cause paraplegia in extension only, 
whereas spinal cord lesions cause paraplegia in ﬂ exion or extension (i.e. ﬂ exor reﬂ exes 
are released with spinal lesions).

 2.  EMG. 
 3.  ECG (particularly in Duchenne ’ s and dystrophia myotonica).

 5.  Echocardiogram (cardiac involvement). 
 Dystrophia myotonica 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This man has noticed some arm weakness. Please examine him.’ 
 2.  ‘This man has cramps. Please examine his upper limbs.’ 
 Less common stem 
 ‘This man has difﬁ culty shaking hands and is not an infectious diseases physician. 
Please examine him.’ 
 Method 
 Standing back to observe the patient, you should notice the features of myotonic dystrophy 
(because now you have become, fortunately, an expert observer) ( Fig. 16.105 ). 
 Proceed as follows:
 1.  Observe the face for frontal baldness (the patient may be wearing a wig), dull triangular 
facies (‘hatchet’ face), temporalis, masseter and sternomastoid atrophy, and partial 
ptosis. Note thick spectacles, as these patients develop cataracts (though a rare fi nding 
now that lens implantation is routine) and fi ne subcapsular deposits, which are virtually 
diagnostic. 
 2.  Look at the neck for sternocleidomastoid atrophy, then test neck fl exion (this is weak, 
whereas extension is normal).

Examination Medicine
 3.  Go to the upper limbs. Shake the patient ’ s hands (for grip myotonia) and test percussion 
myotonia. Tapping over the thenar eminence causes contraction then slow relaxation 
of the abductor pollicis brevis ( Table 16.56 ). 
 4.  Examine the arm now for signs of wasting and weakness, especially of the forearm muscles. 
Sensory changes from the associated peripheral neuropathy are usually very mild. 
 5.  Go to the chest and inspect for gynaecomastia. 
 6.  Ask to palpate the testes for atrophy.

 2.  ‘This man has become unsteady when walking. Please examine his gait.’ 
 Method ( Table 16.57 ) 
 1.  Scan the room for a walking stick or frame or special shoes. 
 2.  Make sure the patient ’ s legs are clearly visible. Ask him or her to ‘hop out’ of the bed 
or chair (look carefully for focal disease while this is being done); watch the patient 
walk normally for a few metres and then ask him or her to turn around quickly and 
walk back towards you. 
 3.  Next ask the patient to walk heel-to-toe to exclude a midline cerebellar lesion. 
 4.  Ask the patient to walk on the toes (an S1 lesion will make this diffi  cult) and then 
on the heels (a lesion causing foot drop will make this diffi  cult). 
 5.  Test for proximal myopathy by asking the patient to squat and then stand up, or sit 
in a chair and then stand. 
 6.  Look for Romberg ’ s sign (posterior column loss causes inability to stand steadily 
when the feet are together with the eyes closed, whereas cerebellar disease also causes 
diffi  culty when the eyes are open). 
 7.  Inspect the back for scars or deformity before lying or sitting the patient down. 
 8.  Go on to formally examine the lower limbs depending on your fi ndings. 
 HINT 
 Remember the classic EMG ﬁ nding in dystrophia myotonica of a ‘dive-bomber’ effect 
with needle movement in the muscle at rest.

Examination Medicine
 9.  You may fi nd clues that direct you towards an extrapyramidal examination (Parkinson ’ s 
disease). 
 Th e typical gaits to recognise are listed in  Table 16.58 . 
 Cerebellum 
 Table 16.58   Typical gaits 
 1.  Hemiparetic (the foot is plantarﬂ exed and the leg swung in a lateral arc) 
 2.  Paraparetic (scissor gait) 
 3.  Extrapyramidal (e.g. Parkinson ’ s disease):
 a.  hesitation in starting 
 b.  shufﬂ ing 
 c.  freezing 
 d.  festination (the patient hurries forward, trying to catch up with the centre of gravity) 
 e.  propulsion (pull the patient towards you gently – he or she will be unable to stop), retropulsion 
 4.  Cerebellar (a drunken gait that is wide based or reeling on a narrow base; the patient staggers towards 
the affected side) 
 5.  Apraxic (prefrontal lobe) (feet appear glued to the ﬂ oor when erect, but move more easily when the 
patient is supine; the arms may move well) 
 6.  Posterior column lesion (clumsy slapping down of the feet on a broad base) 
 7.  Distal weakness (high-stepping gait) 
 8.  Proximal weakness (waddling gait) 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This man has noticed a problem with his coordination. Please examine him.’ 
 2.  ‘This woman ﬁ nds walking difﬁ cult. Please examine her.’ (This could be cerebellar, 
motor, extrapyramidal, sensory or rheumatological – but the type of examination 
required should be obvious from inspection. Otherwise the examiners will make 
the stem more speciﬁ c.) 
 Method 
 If the patient seems likely to have a cerebellar problem ( Table 16.59 ), proceed as follows 
for assessment of cerebellar disease.
 1.  Test the gait (the patient will stagger towards the aff ected side unless the problem 
is bilateral or involves the vermis). 
 2.  Go on to perform a targeted examination of the legs. Pay attention to tone here. 
 HINT 
 If cerebellar testing seems normal but Romberg ’ s test was positive, test position and 
vibration sense.

 MIDLINE 
 1.  Paraneoplastic syndrome 
 2.  Midline tumour 
 ROSTRAL VERMIS LESION (ONLY LOWER LIMBS AFFECTED) 
 1.  Alcohol (most common cause of a cerebellar lesion) 
 3.  Ask the patient to perform the heel–shin test, looking for accuracy of fi ne movement 
when the patient slides his or her heel down the shin quickly on each side for several 
cycles. 
 HINT 
 Subtle cerebellar changes may be obvious only if the test is made more difﬁ cult. Ask 
the patient to lift the leg in an arc before placing it back on the top of the shin. 
 4.  Next, ask the patient to lift the big toe up to touch your fi nger, looking for intention 
tremor. Ask him or her to tap each foot rapidly on a fi rm surface. 
 5.  Look now for nystagmus – usually jerky horizontal nystagmus with increased amplitude 
on looking towards the side of the lesion. 
 6.  Assess speech – ask the patient to say ‘Hippopotamus’, ‘Constitution’ or ‘West 
Register Street’ (if working in London). Cerebellar speech is jerky, explosive and 
loud, with irregular separation of syllables. 
 7.  Go to the upper limbs. Ask the patient to extend the arms and look for arm drift 
and static tremor as a result of hypotonia of the agonist muscles. Test tone. Hypotonia 
is caused by loss of a facilitatory infl uence on the spinal motor neurones in acute 
unilateral cerebellar disease. 
 8.  Test rebound – ask the patient to lift his or her arms quickly from the sides and 
then stop. Hypotonia causes the patient to be unable to stop the arms. Always

Examination Medicine
demonstrate each movement for the patient ’ s benefi t, asking him or her to copy 
you. Ensure the patient does not fall over if the condition is severe. 
 9.  Next, ask the patient to perform the fi nger–nose test – the patient touches his or 
her nose, then rotates the fi nger and touches your fi nger. Note any intention tremor 
(erratic movements increasing as the target is approached owing to loss of cerebellar 
connections with the brain stem) and past pointing (the patient overshooting the 
target). 
 10.  Test rapid alternating movements – the patient taps alternately the palm and back 
of one hand on the other hand or thigh. Inability to perform this movement smoothly 
is called dysdiadochokinesis. 
 11.  Look for truncal ataxia by asking the patient to fold the arms, sit up and then, while 
sitting, to put the legs over the side of the bed; then test for pendular knee jerks. 
 12.  If there is time, look for possible causes of the problem. If there is an obvious 
unilateral lesion, auscultate over the cerebellum, then proceed to the cranial nerves 
and look for evidence of a cerebellopontine angle tumour (the fi fth, seventh, eighth 
cranial nerves are aff ected) and the lateral medullary syndrome. 
 13.  Always look in the fundi for papilloedema. 
 14.  Next, examine for peripheral evidence of malignant disease. 
 15.  If there is a midline lesion alone (i.e. truncal ataxia or abnormal heel–toe walking 
or abnormal speech), consider either a midline tumour or a paraneoplastic syndrome. 
If there is bilateral disease, look for signs of multiple sclerosis, Friedreich ’ s ataxia 
(pes cavus being the most helpful initial clue) ( Tables 16.60 and  16.61 ) and hypo-
thyroidism (rare). Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration (which aff ects the anterior lobe 
of the cerebellar vermis) classically spares the arms. 
 16.  If there are, in addition, upper motor neurone signs, consider the various causes in 
 Table 16.62 . 
 Table 16.60   Clinical features of Friedreich ’ s ataxia (autosomal recessive) 
Usually a young person with: 
 1.  cerebellar signs (bilateral), including nystagmus 
 2.  posterior column loss in the limbs 
 3.  upper motor neurone signs in the limbs (although ankle reﬂ exes are absent) 
 4.  peripheral neuropathy 
 5.  optic atrophy 
 6.  pes cavus, cocking of the toes and kyphoscoliosis 
 7.  cardiomyopathy (ECG abnormalities occur in more than 50% of cases) 
 8.  diabetes mellitus

 Note: Don ’ t forget, common unrelated diseases (e.g. cervical spondylosis and cerebellar degeneration from 
alcohol) may occur together by chance. 
 Common stems 
 1.  ‘This woman has Parkinson ’ s disease. Please assess the severity of the condition.’ 
 2.  ‘This man has noticed a tremor. Please examine him.’ 
 3.  ‘This man has difﬁ culty in walking. Please examine him.’ 
 Method 
 1.  Look at the patient fi rst. Note the obvious lack of facial expression (‘mask-like’) and 
paucity of movement. 
 2.  Ask him or her to walk, turn quickly and stop, and restart. Note particularly any 
diffi  culty starting, shuffl  ing, freezing and festination. It is probably a little dangerous 
to look for propulsion or retropropulsion (see  Table 16.58 ). 
 3.  Ask the patient to return to bed and look for a resting tremor with the arms relaxed 
( Table 16.63 ). Th e characteristic movement is described as ‘pill rolling’ and may be 
unilateral, or asymmetric when bilateral. 
 4.  On fi nger–nose testing, a resting tremor diminishes, but an action tremor may 
appear. Test wrist tone, feeling for cogwheel or lead-pipe rigidity. Reinforce this by 
asking the patient to turn the head from side to side. 
 5.  Test for abnormal rapid alternating movements. Look also for involuntary movements 
produced by medication use. 
 6.  Go to the face. Note tremor, absence of blinking, dribbling of saliva and lack of 
expression. Test the glabellar tap: the sign is positive (Wilson ’ s sign) when the patient 
continues to blink after the middle fi nger taps several times over the glabella from 
behind – it is important that your fi nger is out of the patient ’ s line of vision. 
 7.  Test speech, which is typically monotonous, soft, poorly articulated and faint.

Examination Medicine
 8.  Look at the ocular movements for supranuclear gaze palsies. Feel for a greasy or 
sweaty brow (due to autonomic dysfunction). 
 9.  Ask the patient to write (looking for micrographia) or draw a spiral (smaller than 
normal and lines closer together) 
 10.  Test the frontal lobe refl exes and higher centres (looking for evidence of dementia). 
 11.  Ask to test for postural hypotension. 
 12.  Present your assessment of the degree of disability and whether the main problem 
is rigidity or tremor. Is there evidence of autonomic dysfunction or gaze palsy? 
 Causes of parkinsonism 
 1.  Idiopathic (Parkinson ’ s disease). 
 2.  Drugs (e.g. phenothiazines, methyldopa). 
 3.  Postencephalitis. 
 4.  Other – toxins (carbon monoxide, manganese), Wilson ’ s disease, Steele–Richardson 
syndrome, multisystem atrophy, syphilis, tumour.  Note: Atherosclerosis is controversial 
as a cause of Parkinsonism. 
 Chorea 
 Common stem 
 ‘Please examine this man ’ s arms.’ 
 Less common stem: 
 ‘This man can ’ t keep still. Please examine him.’ 
 HINT 
 A stem that doesn ’ t tell you what system to examine should mean there is an obvious 
diagnosis if you inspect carefully enough. 
 Table 16.63   A classiﬁ cation of tremor 
 1.  Parkinsonian – resting tremor 
 2.  Action tremor – present throughout movement but resolves at rest:
 a.  thyrotoxicosis 
 b.  anxiety 
 c.  drugs 
 d.  familial 
 e.  idiopathic (most common). 
 3.  Intention tremor (cerebellar disease) – increases towards the target 
 4.  Cerebellar outﬂ ow tract tremor (‘red nucleus’) – abduction–adduction movements of upper limbs with 
ﬂ exion–extension of wrists (usually associated with intention tremor, e.g. in multiple sclerosis or brain 
injury) 
 Note: Flapping (asterixis) is not strictly a tremor but rather a sudden brief loss of tone in hepatic failure, 
cardiac failure, respiratory failure or renal failure.

16 • Common short cases
 Method 
 Happily, you notice an extrapyramidal choreiform movement disorder. Choreiform 
movements are non-repetitive, abrupt, involuntary, more distal jerky movements, which 
the patient often attempts to disguise by completing the involuntary movement with a 
voluntary one. Th e condition is caused by a lesion of the corpus striatum.
 •  Hemiballismus is unilateral and usually involves rotary movements of proximal joints. 
It is caused by a subthalamic nucleus lesion on the opposite side. 
 •  Athetosis means slow, sinuous distal writhing movements at rest. It is caused by a 
lesion of the outer segment of the putamen. 
 If the patient has chorea, proceed as follows.
 1.  First, shake the patient ’ s hand. Assess for a variability of sustained grip (‘milkmaid 
grip’). 
 2.  Ask the patient to hold the hands out and look for a choreic posture (fi nger and 
thumb hyperextension and wrist fl exion as a result of hypotonia). Note any signs of 
vasculitis. 
 3.  Go to the face and look at the eyes for exophthalmos, Kayser–Fleischer rings and 
conjunctival injection (ataxia–telangiectasia). Ask the patient to poke the tongue out 
and note a serpentine tongue (moving in and out). Notice any rash (e.g. SLE). 
 4.  Test the knee jerks (pendular) and the higher centres (for Huntington ’ s disease). Th e 
causes of chorea are summarised in  Table 16.64 . 
 5.  If the patient is young, examine the heart for signs of rheumatic fever. 
 Table 16.64   Causes of chorea 
 1.  Huntington ’ s disease (autosomal dominant) 
 2.  Sydenham ’ s chorea (rheumatic fever) 
 3.  Senility 
 4.  Wilson ’ s disease 
 5.  Drugs (e.g. phenothiazines, the contraceptive pill, phenytoin,  L -dopa) 
 6.  Vasculitis or connective tissue disease (e.g. SLE) 
 7.  Thyrotoxicosis (very rare) 
 8.  Polycythaemia or other causes of hyperviscosity (very rare) 
 9.  Viral encephalitis (very rare)
