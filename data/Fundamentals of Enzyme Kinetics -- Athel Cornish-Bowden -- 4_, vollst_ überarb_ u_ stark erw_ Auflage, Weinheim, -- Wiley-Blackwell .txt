Preface to the Fourth Edition
It was said of the great statistician R. A. Fisher that whenever
he introduced a result with the words “it can easily be shown
that . . . ” one could be sure that two or three hours of hard
work would be in store for anyone wishing to verify it. As a
student I thought that many authors used this formula as a
way to avoid explaining things that they could not explain. I
hasten to add that in Fisher’s case I am sure there was no lack
of ability, though there may have been a lack of appreciation
of the difﬁculties that his readers had. When I was writing
the earliest version of this book, therefore, I resolved never to
claim that anything was easy unless I was quite sure that it
was. In the 35 years that have passed since then I believe I
have kept this resolution, though I have often had to revise
my views about what was simple enough to be left unex-
plained. Above all I have striven for clarity, being guided by
a slogan from Keith Laidler: “Correctness, cogency, clarity:
K. J. Laidler (1998) To Light such
a Candle, Oxford University
Press, Oxford
these three, but the greatest of these is clarity”. Errors can be
corrected, weak arguments can be strengthened, but lack of
clarity leaves a fog that may take years to dispel.
The emphasis throughout is on understanding enzyme ki-
netics, not on covering every aspect of the subject in an ency-
clopedic style. So I have preferred to describe the principles
that will allow readers to proceed as far as they want in any
direction. In the words of Kuan-tzu (as quoted by Parzen): “If

you give a man a ﬁsh, he will have a single meal; if you teach
him how to ﬁsh, he will eat all his life”.
I make no apology for continuing to illustrate concepts
with abundant graphs, including the straight-line graphs that
biochemists have used for three-quarters of a century, al-
though it is sometimes argued that the appearance of com-

Preface
puters on every desk has made graphical methods obsolete.
Professional statisticians who really know and understand
data analysis think differently; for example, Chambers and
co-workers wrote
There is no statistical tool that is as powerful as
a well-chosen graph.
Our eye–brain system is
J. M. Chambers, W. S. Cleve-
land, B. Klein and P. A. Tukey
(1983) Graphical Methods for Data
Analysis, Wadsworth, Belmont,
California
the most sophisticated information processor ever
developed, and through graphical displays we can
put this system to good use to obtain deep insight
into the structure of data.
There is little to “see” in a biochemical experiment and al-
most all our information comes at second hand from instru-
ments, so it is essential to convert it into something visible.
At the same time judicious use of the computer is equally
necessary—not just graphs, not just computation, but both,
in partnership—and in this spirit I have not only retained but
have expanded the ﬁnal chapter of the book, which has been
a well received feature of the earlier editions.
Enzyme kinetics is not a topic that changes greatly from
year to year, so why is a new edition needed? The text has
of course been updated, with greater recognition of the im-
portance of enzyme kinetics for biotechnology and drug de-
velopment, and many recent literature references have been
added. The major and most obvious change, however, is in
the manner of presenting the information. There are more
than three times as many ﬁgures as there were in the third
edition, and the need for page-ﬂipping has been virtually
eliminated: not only ﬁgures and tables, but also references
and notes, all appear as close as possible to the context in
which they are mentioned; any that cannot appear on the
same page opening where they are mentioned are never more
than a page away. Here it is a pleasure to acknowledge the
willingness of Wiley–VCH to allow the book to be laid out
exactly as I wanted.
The original ancestor of this book was called Principles of
Enzyme Kinetics, and appeared in 1976. Later I decided that
the treatment needed to be made more elementary, and in
1979 the ﬁrst edition of Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics had
a new title to reﬂect the different emphasis. Over the years,
however, much of the text that was dropped in 1979 has been
put back, together with a signiﬁcant amount of new material
that is not particularly elementary. A case could be made,
however, for reinstating the original title, or just calling it

Enzyme Kinetics, but I have discarded this course in order not
to give the impression that it is more different than it is from
the third edition.
In this edition I have added numerous brief biographies of
some of the scientists who created enzymology. Why? Will it
help students to be better biochemists if they know that Maud
Menten was a woman, that James Sumner was left-handed
but had lost the use of his left hand in a childhood accident,
or that Emil Fischer’s father considered him too stupid to
be a businessman? Obviously not, but it will help them to
understand that enzymology did not spring from nowhere,
but was developed by real people with the same difﬁculties
and hardships that people face today.

Symbols, terminology and abbreviations
This book follows as far as possible the recommendations
of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology. However, as these allow some latitude and in any

case do not cover all of the cases that we shall need, it is
useful to begin by noting some points that apply generally
in the book.
First of all, it is important to recognize that
a chemical substance and its concentration are two different
entities and need to be represented by different symbols. The
recommendations allow square brackets around the chemical
name to be used without deﬁnition for its concentration, so
[glucose] is the concentration of glucose, [A] is the concen-
tration of a substance A, and so on. In this book I shall use
this convention for names that consist of more than a single
letter, but it has the disadvantage that the profusion of square
brackets can lead to forbiddingly complicated equations in
enzyme kinetics (see some of the equations in Chapter 8,
Chapter 8, pages 189–226
for example, and imagine how they would look with square
brackets). Two simple alternatives are possible: one is just
to put the name in italics, so the concentration of A is A, for
example, and this accords well with the standard convention
that chemical names are written in roman (upright) type and
algebraic symbols are written in italics. However, experience

1. Basic principles of chemical kinetics
shows that many readers barely notice whether a particular
symbol is roman or italic, and so it discriminates less well
than one would hope between the two kinds of entity. For this
reason I shall use the lower-case italic letter that corresponds
to the symbol for the chemical entity, so a is the concentration
of A, for example. If the chemical symbol has any subscripts,
these apply unchanged to the concentration symbol, so a0 is
the concentration of A0, for example. Both of these systems
(and others) are permitted by the recommendations as long
as each symbol is deﬁned when ﬁrst used. This provision
is satisﬁed in this book, and it is good to follow it in gen-
eral, because almost nothing that authors consider obvious
is perceived as obvious by all their readers. In the problems
at the ends of the chapters, incidentally, the symbols may not
be the same as those used in the corresponding chapters: this
is intentional, because in the real world one cannot always
expect the questions that one has to answer to be presented in
familiar terms.
As we shall see, an enzyme-catalyzed reaction virtually
always consists of two or more steps, and as we shall need
symbols to refer to the different steps it is necessary to have
some convenient indexing system to show which symbol
refers to which step. The recommendations do not impose
any particular system, but, most important, they do require
the system in use to be stated. Because of the different ways
in which, for example, the symbol k2 has been used in the
biochemical literature one should never assume in the ab-
sence of a clear deﬁnition what is intended. In this book I use
the system preferred by the recommendations: for a reaction
of n steps, these are numbered 1, 2 ... n; lower-case italic k
with a positive subscript refers to the kinetic properties of the
forward step corresponding to the subscript, for example, k2
refers to the forward direction of the second step; the same
with a negative subscript refers to the corresponding reverse
reaction, for example, k−2 for the second step; a capital italic
K with a subscript refers to the thermodynamic (equilibrium)
properties of the whole step and is typically the ratio of the
two kinetic constants, for example, K2 = k2/k−2.
The policy regarding the use of abbreviations in this book
can be stated very simply: there are no abbreviations in this
book (other than in verbatim quotations and the index, which
needs to include the entries readers expect to ﬁnd). Much of
the modern literature is rendered virtually unintelligible to
nonspecialist readers by a profusion of unnecessary abbrevi-
ations. They save little space, and little work (because with
1.2 Order of a reaction
3
modern word-processing equipment it takes no more than a
few seconds to expand all of the abbreviations that one may
have found it convenient to use during preparation), but the
barrier to comprehension that they represent is formidable.
A few apparent exceptions (like “ATP”) are better regarded
as standardized symbols than as abbreviations, especially be-
cause they are more easily understood by most biochemists
than the words they stand for.

century, when Wilhelmy was apparently the ﬁrst to recognize
that the rate at which a chemical reaction proceeds follows
deﬁnite laws, but although his work paved the way for the
law of mass action of Waage and Guldberg, it attracted little
attention until it was taken up by Ostwald towards the end
of the century, as discussed by Laidler. Wilhelmy realized
that chemical rates depended on the concentrations of the
reactants, but before considering some examples we need to
examine how chemical reactions can be classiﬁed.
One way is according to the molecularity, which deﬁnes the
number of molecules that are altered in a reaction: a reaction
A →P is unimolecular (sometimes called monomolecular), and a
reaction A + B →P is bimolecular. One-step reactions of higher
molecularity are extremely rare, if they occur at all, but a
reaction A + B + C →P would be trimolecular (or termolecular).
Alternatively one can classify a reaction according to its order,
a description of its kinetics that deﬁnes how many concentra-
tion terms must be multiplied together to get an expression
for the rate of reaction. Hence, in a ﬁrst-order reaction the rate
is proportional to one concentration; in a second-order reaction
it is proportional to the product of two concentrations or to
the square of one concentration; and so on.

Figure 1.1. Order of reaction.
When a reaction is of ﬁrst order
with respect to a reactant A the
rate is proportional to its con-
centration a. If it is of second
order the rate is proportional to
a2; if it is of zero order it does
not vary with a.
For a simple reaction that consists of a single step, or for
each step in a complex reaction, the order is usually the same
as the molecularity (though this may not be apparent if one
concentration, for example that of the solvent if it is also a
reactant, is so large that it is effectively constant). However,
many reactions consist of sequences of unimolecular and bi-
molecular steps, and the molecularity of the complete reaction
need not be the same as its order. Indeed, a complex reaction
often has no meaningful order, as the overall rate often cannot
4

be expressed as a product of concentration terms.
As we
shall see in later chapters, this is almost universal in enzyme
kinetics, where not even the simplest enzyme-catalyzed reac-
tions have simple orders. Nonetheless, the individual steps
in enzyme-catalyzed reactions nearly always do have simple
orders, usually ﬁrst or second order, and the concept of order
is important for understanding enzyme kinetics. The binding
of a substrate molecule to an enzyme molecule is a typical
example of a second-order bimolecular reaction in enzyme
kinetics, whereas conversion of an enzyme–substrate com-
plex into products or into another intermediate is a typical
example of a ﬁrst-order unimolecular reaction.
1.2.2
First-order kinetics
The rate v of a ﬁrst-order reaction A " P can be expressed as
v ? dp
dt ? da
dt ? ka ? k)a0  p*
(1.1)
in which a and p are the concentrations of A and P respec-
tively at any time t, k is a ﬁrst-order rate constant and a0 is
a constant. As we shall see throughout this book, the idea
of a rate constant1 is fundamental in all varieties of chemical
kinetics. The ﬁrst two equality signs in the equation represent
alternative deﬁnitions of the rate v: because every molecule
of A that is consumed becomes a molecule of P, it makes
no difference to the mathematics whether the rate is deﬁned
in terms of the appearance of product or disappearance of
reactant. It may make a difference experimentally, however,
because experiments are not done with perfect accuracy, and
in the early stages of a reaction the relative changes in p are
much larger than those in a (Figure 1.2). For this reason it
will usually be more accurate to measure increases in p than
decreases in a.

the relative increases in p are

changes in a.
§10.4.3, pages 264–265
The third equality sign in the equation is the one that
speciﬁes that this is a ﬁrst-order reaction, because it states
that the rate is proportional to the concentration of reactant A.
1Some authors, especially those with a strong background in physics,
object to the term “rate constant” (preferring “rate coefﬁcient”) for quantities
like k in equation 1.1 and for many similar quantities that will occur in this
book, on the perfectly valid grounds that they are not constant, because they
vary with temperature and with many other conditions. However, the use of
the word “constant” to refer to quantities that are constant only under highly
restricted conditions is virtually universal in biochemical kinetics (and far
from unknown in chemical kinetics), and it is hardly practical to abandon
this usage in this book. See also the discussion at the end of Section 10.4.3.
1.2 Order of a reaction

Finally, if the time zero is deﬁned in such a way that a = a0
and p = 0 when t = 0, the stoichiometry allows the values
of a and p at any time to be related according to the equation
a + p = a0, thereby allowing the last equality in the equation.
Equation 1.1 can readily be integrated by separating the
two variables p and t, bringing all terms in p to the left-hand
side and all terms in t to the right-hand side:

dp
a0 −p =

k dt
therefore
−ln(a0 −p) = kt + α
in which α, the constant of integration, can be evaluated by
noting that there is no product at the start of the reaction, so
p = 0 when t = 0. Then α = −ln(a0), and so
ln

= −kt
(1.2)
Taking exponentials of both sides we have
a0 −p
a0
= e−kt
which can be rearranged to give
p = a0(1 −e−kt)
(1.3)
Notice that the constant of integration α was included in this
derivation, evaluated and found to be nonzero. Constants
of integration must always be included and evaluated when
integrating kinetic equations; they are rarely found to be zero.

The half-time t0.5 is the time
taken for the reactant concen-
tration to decrease by half from
any starting point. For a ﬁrst-
order reaction, but not for other
orders of reaction, it remains
constant as the reaction
proceeds.
Inserting p = 0.5a0 into equation 1.3 at a time t = t0.5
known as the half-time allows us to calculate kt0.5 = ln 2 =
0.693, so t0.5 = 0.693/k. This value is independent of the
value of a0, so the time required for the concentration of
reactant to decrease by half is a constant, for a ﬁrst-order
process, as illustrated in Figure 1.3. The half-time is not a
constant for other orders of reaction.
1.2.3
Second-order kinetics
The commonest type of bimolecular reaction is one of the
form A + B →P + Q, in which two different kinds of molecule
6

A and B react to give products. In this example the rate is
likely to be given by a second-order expression of the form
v = dp
dt = kab = k(a0 −p)(b0 −p)
in which k is now a second-order rate constant.2 Again, inte-
gration is readily achieved by separating the two variables p
and t:

dp
(a0 −p)(b0 −p) =

k dt
For readers with limited mathematical experience, the sim-
plest and most reliable method for integrating the left-hand
side of this equation is to look it up in a standard table of
integrals.3
It may also be done by multiplying both sides

into two simple integrals:


(b0 −a0)k dt
Hence
−ln(a0 −p) + ln(b0 −p) = (b0 −a0)kt + α

ln

b0(a0 −p)

= (b0 −a0)kt
or
a0(b0 −p)
b0(a0 −p) = e(b0−a0)kt
(1.4)
A special case of this result is important: if a0 is negligible
compared with b0, then (b0 −a0) ≈b0; p can never exceed
a0, on account of the stoichiometry of the reaction, and so
(b0 −p) ≈b0. Introducing both approximations, equation 1.4
can be simpliﬁed as follows:
a0

b0


b0(a0 −p) = ekb0t
2Conventional symbolism does not indicate the order of a rate constant.
For example, it is common practice to illustrate simple enzyme kinetics with
a mechanism in which k1 is a second-order rate constant and k2 is a ﬁrst-
order rate constant: there is no way to know this from the symbols alone, it is
important to deﬁne each rate constant when it is ﬁrst used.

chapter (and the last one will not be needed until Chapter 7).

and, remembering that 1/ekb0t ≡e−kb0t, this can be rear-
ranged to read
p = a0(1 −e−kb0t)
which has exactly the same form as equation 1.3, the equation
for a ﬁrst-order reaction. This type of reaction is known as
a pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction, and kb0 is a pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate
constant. Pseudo-ﬁrst-order conditions occur naturally when
one of the reactants is the solvent, as in most hydrolysis reac-
tions, but it is also advantageous to create them deliberately,
to simplify evaluation of the rate constant (Section 1.5).
§1.5, pages 11–13
1.2.4
Third-order kinetics
A trimolecular reaction, such as A + B + C →P + ..., does
not normally consist of a single trimolecular step involving
a three-body collision, which would be inherently unlikely;
consequently it is not usually third-order. Instead it is likely
to consist of two or more elementary steps, such as A + B
⇋X followed by X + C →P. In some reactions the kinetic
behavior as a whole is largely determined by the rate constant
of the step with the smaller rate constant, accordingly known
as the rate-limiting step (or, more objectionably, as the rate-
determining step).4
When there is no clearly deﬁned rate-

limiting step the rate equation is typically complex, with no
integral order. Some trimolecular reactions do display third-
order kinetics, however, with v = kabc, where k is now a third-
order rate constant, but it is not necessary to assume a three-
body collision to account for third-order kinetics. Instead, we
can assume a two-step mechanism, as before but with the ﬁrst
step rapidly reversible, so that the concentration of X is given
by x = Kab, where K is the equilibrium constant for binding
of A to B, the association constant of X (Figure 1.4). The rate
of reaction is then the rate of the slow second step:
v = k′xc = k′Kabc
where k′ is the second-order rate constant for the second step.
Hence the observed third-order rate constant is actually the
product of a second-order rate constant and an equilibrium
constant.
§14.1.3, pages 383–385
4These terms are widespread in chemistry, but they involve some con-
ceptual confusion, as discussed in Section 14.1.3, and as far as possible are
best avoided.

1. Basic principles of chemical kinetics
1.2.5
Zero-order kinetics
Some reactions are observed to be of zero order, with a con-
stant rate, independent of the concentration of reactant. If a
reaction is zero order with respect to only one reactant, this
may simply mean that the reactant enters the reaction after the
rate-limiting step. However, some reactions are zero-order
overall, which means that they are independent of all reactant
concentrations. These are invariably catalyzed reactions and
occur if every reactant is present in such large excess that the
full potential of the catalyst is realized. Enzyme-catalyzed re-
actions commonly approach zero-order kinetics at very high
reactant concentrations.
1.2.6
Determination of the order of a reaction
The simplest means of determining the order of a reaction
is to measure the rate v at different concentrations a of the
reactants. A plot of ln v against ln a is then a straight line

drawn for a reaction that is
second-order in a reactant A
(and ﬁrst-order in another react-
ant B, but this is not evident
from the plot) so the slope of
the line is 2. The appearance of

erical values) would be the
same if logarithms to base 10 or
any other base were used in-
stead of natural logarithms,

were made in both coordinates.
with slope equal to the order. As well as the overall order it is
useful to know the order with respect to each reactant, which
can be found by altering the concentration of each reactant
separately, keeping the other concentrations constant.
The
slope of the line is then equal to the order with respect to the
variable reactant. For example, if the reaction is second-order
in A and ﬁrst-order in B,
v = ka2b
then
ln v = ln k + 2 ln a + ln b
Hence a plot of ln v against ln a (with b held constant) has a
slope of 2 (Figure 1.5), and a plot of ln v against ln b (with a
held constant) has a slope of 1 (Figure 1.6). If the plots are
drawn with the slopes measured from the progress curve (a
plot of concentration against time), the concentrations of all
the reactants change with time. Therefore, if valid results are
to be obtained, either the initial concentrations of the reactants
must be in stoichiometric ratio, in which event the overall
order is found, or (more usually) the “constant” reactants

must be in large excess at the start of the reaction, so that
the changes in their concentrations are insigniﬁcant. If neither
of these alternatives is possible or convenient, the rates must
be obtained from a set of measurements of the slope at zero
time, that is to say measurements of initial rates. This method

is usually preferable for kinetic measurements of enzyme-
catalyzed reactions, because the progress curves of enzyme-
catalyzed reactions often do not rigorously obey simple rate
equations for extended periods of time. The progress curve
of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction (Section 2.9) often requires
§2.9, pages 63–71
a more complicated equation than the integrated form of
the rate equation derived for the initial rate, because of pro-
gressive loss of enzyme activity, inhibition by accumulating
products and other effects.
1.3
Dimensions of rate constants
Dimensional analysis provides a quick and versatile tech-
nique for detecting algebraic mistakes and checking results.
It depends on the existence of a few simple rules governing
the permissible ways of combining quantities of different di-
mensions, and on the frequency with which algebraic errors
result in dimensionally inconsistent expressions.
Concen-
trations can be expressed in M (or mol · l−1), and reaction
rates in M · s−1.
In an equation that expresses a rate v in
terms of a concentration a as v = ka, therefore, the rate
constant k must be expressed in s−1 if the left- and right-
hand sides of the equation are to have the same dimen-
sions. All ﬁrst-order rate constants have the dimensions of
time−1, and by a similar argument second-order rate con-
stants have the dimensions of concentration−1 × time−1 (Fig-
ure 1.7), third-order rate constants have the dimensions of
concentration−2 × time−1, and zero-order rate constants have
the dimensions of concentration × time−1.
v = kab
M · s−1
M−1 · s−1

therefore k must be
Figure 1.7. Units of rate
constants. If a rate v = kab is
measured in M · s−1 and the
two concentrations a and b are
measured in M, then the left-
and right-hand sides of the
equation can only have the
same units if the second-order
rate constant k is measured in
M−1 · s−1.
Knowledge of the dimensions of rate constants allows the
correctness of derived equations to be checked easily: the left-
and right-hand sides of any equation (or inequality) must
have the same dimensions, and all terms in a summation
must have the same dimensions.
For example, if (1 + t)
occurs in an equation, where t has the dimensions of time,
then the equation is incorrect, even if the “1” is intended to
represent a time that happens to have the numerical value
of 1. Rather than mixing dimensioned constants and variables
in an expression in this way it is better to write the unit after
the number, (1 s + t) for example, or to give the constant a
symbol, (t0 + t) for example, with a note in the text deﬁning
t0 as 1 s.
Although both alternatives appear more clumsy
than just writing (1 + t) they avoid confusion. Section 9.6.1
§9.6.1, pages 242–244
contains an example, equation 9.12, where clarity requires
inclusion of units inside an equation.

divided, but must not be added or subtracted. Thus, if k1 is a
ﬁrst-order rate constant and k2 is a second-order rate constant,
a statement such as k1 ≫k2 is meaningless, just as 5 g ≫25 ◦C
is meaningless. However, a pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant
such as k2a has the dimensions of concentration−1 × time−1×
concentration, which simpliﬁes to time−1; it therefore has the
dimensions of a ﬁrst-order rate constant, and can be compared
with other ﬁrst-order rate constants.
Another major principle of dimensional analysis is that
one must not use a dimensioned quantity as an exponent
or take its logarithm. For example, e−kt is permissible, if k
is a ﬁrst-order rate constant, but e−t is not.
An apparent
exception is that it is often convenient to take the logarithm
of what appears to be a concentration, for example when pH
is deﬁned as −log[H+]. The explanation is that the deﬁnition
is not strictly accurate and to be dimensionally correct one
should deﬁne pH as −log [H+]/[H+]0, where [H+]0 is the
value of [H+] in the standard state, corresponding to pH = 0.
As [H+]0 has a numerical value of 1 it is usually omitted
from the deﬁnition. Whenever one takes the logarithm of a

Dimensional analysis is particularly useful as an aid to
remembering the slopes and intercepts of commonly used
plots, and the rules are simple: any intercept must have the
same dimensions as whatever variable is plotted along the
corresponding axis, and a slope must have the dimensions
of the ordinate (y) divided by those of the abscissa (x). These
rules are illustrated in Figure 1.8.

Reversible reactions
All chemical reactions are reversible in principle, and for
many the reverse reaction is readily observable in practice as
well, and must be allowed for in the rate equation:

This differential equation is of exactly the same form as equa-

Therefore

Determination of ﬁrst-order rate constants
It is common for a reaction to be ﬁrst-order in every reactant,
and it is then often possible to carry it out under pseudo-ﬁrst-
order conditions overall by keeping every reactant except one
in large excess. In many practical situations, therefore, the
problem of determining a rate constant can be reduced to the
problem of determining a ﬁrst-order rate constant. We have
seen in equation 1.3 that for a simple ﬁrst-order reaction,
p = a0(1 −e−kt)
and in the more general case of a reversible reaction, equa-
tion 1.6:
p = p∞[1 −e−(k1+k−1)t]

So
p∞−p = p∞e−(k1+k−1)t
(1.7)
Therefore,
ln(p∞−p) = ln p∞−(k1 + k−1)t
Thus a plot of ln(p∞−p) against t gives a straight line of slope
−(k1 + k−1) (Figure 1.10). Before pocket calculators became
universally available this was usually expressed in terms of
logarithms to base 10:
log(p∞−p) = log p∞−(k1 + k−1)t

the determination of the veloc-

Guggenheim pointed out a major objection to this plot: it
depends heavily on an accurate value of p∞. In the general
case of a reversible reaction with p∞different from a0 an
accurate value of p∞is difﬁcult to obtain, and even in the
special case of an irreversible reaction with p∞identical to
a0 the instantaneous concentration of A at zero time may
be difﬁcult to measure accurately.
Guggenheim suggested
measuring two sets of values pi and p′
i at times ti and t′
i, such
that every t′
i = ti + τ, where τ is a constant.

Taking logarithms,

5An argument could be made for dispensing with common logarithms
(to base 10) altogether in modern science, as they are now virtually never
used as an aid to arithmetic. However, this will hardly be practical as long as
the pH scale continues to be used, and in historical references, such as that in
the legend of Figure 2.3, it would be incorrect to imply that natural logarithms
were used if they were not. Finally, when graphs need to span several orders
of magnitude (as in Figure 2.13) it is much easier for the reader to interpret
a scale marked in decades than in powers of e. Otherwise, however, there
usually is no good reason to use common logarithms, and then, as in Figures
1.5 and 6, they are replaced with natural logarithms.

It is known as
a Guggenheim plot, and does not require an estimate of p.
As k1/k1 is equal to the equilibrium constant, which can
be estimated independently, the values of the individual rate
constants k1 and k1 can be calculated from the two combina-
tions.
The Guggenheim plot is insensitive to deviations from
ﬁrst-order kinetics: it can give an apparently good straight
line even if ﬁrst-order kinetics are not accurately obeyed. For
this reason it should not be used to determine the order of re-
action, which should be established independently. The same
comment applies to the related Kézdy–Swinbourne plot, the
subject of Problem 1.3 at the end of this chapter.

The steady state

than it enters; level rises.

steady state. In a reaction A "
B " C, the concentration of the
intermediate B rises if A " B
proceeds faster than B " C.
However, as the rate of the
second reaction increases with
the concentration of B it in-
creases in these conditions. The
same can be observed in a tank
when water ﬂows in faster than
it ﬂows out.
Steady state: water exits as fast as 
it enters; level remains constant.

the concentration of B is suf-
ﬁcient to drive the reaction B "

in a steady state.
All of the chemical processes considered to this point have
been single-step reactions, but reality is not so simple, and this
is particularly important for considering enzyme-catalyzed
reactions, because these are essentially never single-step re-
actions. A reaction of more than one step, such as
A " B " C
usually does not have simple ﬁrst-order kinetics, even if it is
unimolecular overall (as this one is), and similar considera-
tions apply to reactions that are bimolecular overall, and to
reactions with more than two steps.
Nonetheless, in conditions where the concentration of in-
termediate is always very small the behavior can be simple.

hydrogen: the inﬂuence of

Chemie 85, 329–397
In such conditions a reaction may reach a state in which the
concentration of intermediate does not change perceptibly
during signiﬁcant periods of time. The general idea is quite
familiar from everyday observation of the ﬂow of water in a
basin when the outlet is left open. Initially (Figure 1.12) the
level of water in the basin is too small to bring the pressure
at the outlet to a value sufﬁcient to drive the water out as
fast as it enters, so the level must rise. Once the necessary
pressure is reached the water ﬂows out as fast as it enters
(Figure 1.13) and the level remains constant as long as the
14

external conditions remain constant. Notice that this is not an
equilibrium, because there is continuous unidirectional ﬂow
through the system; instead it is a steady state. If you are not
convinced you can readily verify that a basin of water will
behave as described.
Although we have assumed here that the steady state
is reached from below—either a low concentration of inter-
mediate or a low level of water—it is also possible, though
less likely in simple reactions, for the initial concentration of
intermediate to be higher than the steady-state value, and in
this case it will decrease until the same steady state is reached.
The idea of a steady state was introduced by Chapman
and Underhill, and developed by Bodenstein in particular. As
we shall see in later chapters, it is absolutely crucial in the
analysis of enzyme catalysis, because enzyme-catalyzed reac-
tions are very often studied in conditions where the enzyme
concentration is very small compared with the concentrations
of the reactants, and this implies that the concentrations of all
intermediates in the process are also very small.

LIZABETH FULHAME.
Almost all that is known
of Elizabeth Fulhame is
derived from her book An Essay
on Combustion, which she pub-
lished privately in 1794. She
appears to have been the wife of
Dr Thomas Fulhame, a physi-
cian who obtained his doctorate
from the University of Edin-
burgh on the basis of a study of
puerperal fever. The interest of
her work for enzymology lies
not only in her description of
catalysis, a generation before
Berzelius, but also in the emph-
asis that she placed on the role
of water and in the fact that she
was possibly the ﬁrst to realize
that a chemical reaction might
require more than one step. She
was a pioneer in the study of
the effect of light on silver salts,
and her discovery of photo-
reduction marks a ﬁrst step for
developing photography.
To this point we have discussed the dependence of reaction
rates on concentrations as if the only concentrations that
needed to be considered were those of the reactants, but this is
obviously too simple: more than two centuries ago Fulhame
noted that many reactions would not proceed at a detectable
rate unless the mixture contained certain necessary nonreac-
tant components (most notably water).
In a major insight
that did not become generally adopted in chemistry until
many years later, she realized that her observation was most
easily interpreted by supposing that such components were
consumed in the early stages of the reaction and regenerated
at the end.
Fulhame’s work was largely forgotten by the time that
Berzelius introduced the term catalysis for this sort of behav-

idées sur une nouvelle force

ior. He considered it to be an “only rarely observed force”,
unlike Fulhame, who had come to the opposite conclusion
that water was necessary for virtually all reactions.
Both
points of view are extreme, of course, but at least in enzyme
chemistry the overwhelming majority of known reactions do
require water. To a considerable degree the study of enzyme
catalysis is the study of catalysis in aqueous solution, and as
the relevant terminology will be introduced later in the book
1.8 Temperature and pressure
15
when we need it, there is little to add here, beyond remarking
that despite its age the classic book by Jencks remains an ex-
cellent source of general information on catalysis in chemistry
and biochemistry, for readers who need more emphasis on
chemical mechanisms than is found in the present book.
Fulhame’s view that a catalyst reacts in a cyclic fashion,
consumed in one step of reaction, and regenerated in a later
one (Figure 1.14a), is now generally accepted as an explana-
tion of catalysis, but even at the beginning of the 20th century
this was not fully understood, and Henri discussed the possi-

bility that an enzyme might form a complex with its substrate
but that this complex was not part of the reaction cycle; in-
stead, the free enzyme might act on the substrate, perhaps by
emitting some sort of radiation, as suggested by Barendrecht,
and shown in Figure 1.14b. These ideas are completely obso-
lete, though they are still occasionally discussed, for example
by Schnell and co-workers, but they led Henri to enunciate
a principle, now called homeomorphism, that remains vital for
kinetic analysis: the fact that a particular equation generates
an equation consistent with experimental observations does
not demonstrate that the equation is correct, because two
or more mechanisms may lead to indistinguishable kinetic
equations.

The Arrhenius equation
From the earliest studies of reaction rates, it has been evident
that they are profoundly inﬂuenced by temperature.
The
most elementary consequence of this is that the temperature
must always be controlled if meaningful results are to be

obtained from kinetic experiments. However, with care, one
can use temperature much more positively and, by carrying
out measurements at several temperatures, deduce important
information about reaction mechanisms.
The studies of van ’t Hoff and Arrhenius form the starting
point for all modern theories of the temperature dependence
of rate constants. Harcourt had earlier noted that the rates of
many reactions approximately doubled for each 10◦C rise in
temperature, but van ’t Hoff and Arrhenius attempted to ﬁnd
a more exact relationship by comparing kinetic observations
with the known properties of equilibrium constants.

except that it must be the same in both equations (because
otherwise it would not vanish when one equation is sub-

thermodynamic considerations and involves no assumptions.
However, it proved difﬁcult or impossible to show experi-
mentally that the term λ in these equations was necessary. So
Arrhenius postulated that its value was in fact zero, and that
the temperature dependence of any rate constant k could be
expressed by an equation of the form

However, the version in equation 1.11 is more convenient for

1.8.2
Elementary collision theory
It is instructive to relate the rates of reactions in the gas phase
with the frequencies of collisions between the reactant mole-
cules. According to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of
energies among molecules, the number of molecules in a
mixture that have energies in excess of −Ea is proportional
to e−Ea/RT. We can therefore interpret the Arrhenius equation
to mean that molecules can take part in a reaction only if their
energy exceeds some threshold value, the activation energy. In
this interpretation, the constant A ought to be equal to the
frequency of collisions, Z, at least for bimolecular reactions,
and it certainly follows from equation 1.12 that A is the value
the rate constant would have if inﬁnite temperature, with
1/T = 0, could be attained. For some simple reactions in the
gas phase, such as the decomposition of hydrogen iodide, A
is indeed equal to Z, but in general it is necessary to introduce
a factor P,

parents who had moved to
Mexico during a period of
perceived persecution of Mor-
mons in the USA. Later his

moil that followed the Mexican
revolution of 1910 to return to
the USA, but despite this
troubled childhood he was able
to win a scholarship to the Uni-
versity of Arizona, and later
obtained his doctorate at the
University of California,
Berkeley, for work on ionization
provoked by α particles. He
developed his ground-breaking
work on the theory of reaction

k = PZe−Ea/RT
(1.13)
and to assume that, in addition to colliding with sufﬁcient
energy, molecules must also be correctly oriented if they are
to react.
The factor P is then taken to be a measure of
the probability that the correct orientation will be adopted
spontaneously, so we modify the interpretation above to say
that at inﬁnite temperature every collision is productive if the
orientation is correct.
With this interpretation of the factor P, equation 1.13 ac-
cords reasonably well with modern theories of reaction rates
in the gas phase. However, virtually all of the reactions that
interest biochemists concern complicated molecules in the
liquid phase, and collision frequencies have little relevance
for these. Thus we need a theory that explains the experimen-
tal observations in a way that is as appropriate in aqueous
solution as it is in the gas phase.

Transition-state theory
The transition-state theory (sometimes called the theory of abso-
lute reaction rates) is derived largely from the work of Eyring,
and was fully developed in the book by Glasstone and co-
workers. It is so called because it relates the rates of chemical

high-energy state of the reacting molecules, known as the
transition state. (The term activated complex is also sometimes
used, but it is best avoided in discussions of enzyme reactions,
in which the word complex is often used with a different mean-
ing). As a reacting system passes along a notional “reaction
coordinate”, it must pass through a continuum of energy
states, as illustrated in Figure 1.18, and at some stage it must
pass through a state of maximum energy.
This maximum
energy state is the transition state, and should be clearly
distinguished from an intermediate, which represents not a
maximum but a metastable minimum on the reaction proﬁle.
No intermediates occur in the reaction proﬁle shown in Figure
1.18, but a two-step example is shown in Figure 1.19 with
one intermediate and two transition states.

reaction can be represented as

where X‡ is the transition state. It is assumed to be in quasi-

state in which the entire system (including products P and
Q) is at equilibrium just before the products are abruptly
swept away.

important point is that the sudden absence of P and Q has
no effect on the concentration of X‡, which is related to those
of A and B by an ordinary equilibrium expression:
[X‡] = K‡[A][B]
where K‡ is given by
∆G‡ = −RT ln K‡ = ∆H‡ −T∆S‡
and ∆G‡, ∆H‡ and ∆S‡ are the Gibbs energy, enthalpy and
entropy of formation, respectively, of the transition state from

[X‡] = [A][B]e∆S‡/Re−∆H‡/RT

Given the way the quasi-equilibrium was described, the
transition-state species in equilibrium with A and B are ones
that in the immediate past were molecules of A and B. Be-
cause of this the ﬁrst step in equation 1.15 must be written
with an irreversible arrow: it is a mistake, found in many
accounts of the theory, including those in the ﬁrst and second
editions of this book,7 to represent this as a reversible reaction.
The practical importance of this is that molecules that reach
X‡ from the left in equation 1.15 are like bodies propelled up
a slope towards a col: any that reach it are virtually certain to
continue down the slope on the other side.

between transition states and

consists of more than one step,
with multiple maxima and
hence multiple transition states.
In such examples states of
minimum energy along the
reaction proﬁle are called
intermediates. In catalysis, the
major subject of this book, the
existence of an intermediate
causes the maximum energy
barrier to the reaction to be
lowered.
As written, equation 1.16 contains no information about
time, like any true thermodynamic equation. We can intro-
duce time by taking account of the natural vibrations that the
transition state can undergo. For all but one of the vibration
modes the transition state is in no way special: most chemical
bonds vibrate in the same way as they would in an ordinary
molecule. The exception is the bond that becomes broken in
the reaction: its vibration frequency can be calculated from
the same quantum-mechanical principles that underlie other
vibrations, but it is assumed to have no restoring force, so
once the bond starts to break it continues to break. Figure
1.20 illustrates curves for the dependence of energy on bond
length in a breaking C—H bond. Notice that for short bond

lengths the curves are of similar shape, but for stretched
bonds they are quite different: the curve for the ground state
has a minimum and that for the transition state does not.
We shall again consider molecular vibrations in Section 9.6,

because they are important for understanding the effects of
isotopic substitution on reaction rates.
It follows from considerations of this kind (for more detail,
see the book by Laidler and co-workers mentioned above)
that equation 1.16 allows calculation of the concentration of
the transition state, and vibration frequency for the breaking
bond allows the rate constant for the breakdown of X‡ to be
calculated as RT/Nh, where N is the Avogadro constant and
h is Planck’s constant.8 The second-order rate constant for the

Comparison of this with equation 1.10, the Arrhenius
equation, shows that the activation energy Ea is not equal
to ∆H‡, but to ∆H‡ + RT. Moreover, Ea is not strictly inde-
pendent of temperature, so the Arrhenius plot ought to be
curved (not only because of the obvious variation of RT with
temperature, but also because ∆H‡ is not strictly temperature-
independent). However, the expected curvature is so slight
that one would not normally expect to detect it (and the
curvature one does often detect in Arrhenius plots is usually
attributable to other causes); the variation in k that results
from the factor T in equation 1.18 is trivial in comparison with
variation in the exponential term.

EITH JAMES LAIDLER
(1916–2003) was born in
Liverpool, but he spent
most of his working life in
Canada, at the University of
Ottawa. He studied with Cyril
Hinshelwood at Oxford and
obtained his doctorate under
Henry Eyring at Princeton, and
with both of these distinguished
teachers he participated in lay-
ing the foundations of chemical
kinetics. After such a beginning
one might have expected him to
build his career in physical
chemistry, but he became
increasingly interested in the
interface between physical
chemistry and enzyme kinetics.
His book The Chemical Kinetics of
Enzyme Action (1958) was for a
long time unrivaled as a model
of how the subject should be
presented.
As both A and Ea in equation 1.11 can readily be deter-
mined in practice from an Arrhenius plot, both ∆H‡ and ∆S‡
can be calculated, from

The enthalpy and entropy of activation of a chemical reac-
tion provide valuable information about the nature of the
transition state, and hence about the reaction mechanism. A
large enthalpy of activation indicates that a large amount of
stretching, squeezing or even breaking of chemical bonds is
necessary for the formation of the transition state.
The entropy of activation gives a measure of the inherent
probability of the transition state, apart from energetic con-
siderations.
If ∆S‡ is large and negative, the formation of
the transition state requires the reacting molecules to adopt
precise conformations and approach one another at a precise
1.8 Temperature and pressure
21
angle.
As molecules vary widely in their conformational
stability, that is to say in their rigidity, and in their complexity,
one might expect the values of ∆S‡ to vary widely between
different reactions. They do, though establishing the variation
with certainty is difﬁcult for the sort of reactions that interest
biochemists because of the restricted temperature range over
which they can usually be studied (Section 11.4). The mole-
cules that are important in metabolic processes are mostly
large and ﬂexible, and so uncatalyzed reactions between them
are inherently unlikely, which means that −∆S‡ is usually
large.
Equation 1.17 shows that a catalyst can increase the rate
of a reaction either by increasing ∆S‡ (in practice this usually
means decreasing the positive quantity −∆S‡) or by decreas-
ing ∆H‡, or both. It is likely that both effects are important
in enzyme catalysis, though deﬁnite evidence of this cannot
usually be obtained because the uncatalyzed reactions are too
slow for their values of ∆S‡ and ∆H‡ to be measured.
In all of this it must not be forgotten that the solvent,
normally water in enzyme-catalyzed reactions, is a part of the
system and that entropy effects in the solvent can contribute
greatly to entropies of activation. It is an error, therefore, and
possibly a serious one, to try to interpret their magnitudes
entirely in terms of ordering or disordering of the reactants
themselves.
Solvent effects can be of major importance in
reactions involving ionic or polar species.

Effects of hydrostatic pressure
I shall not discuss pressure effects extensively in this book (for

Enzyme Action, 2nd edition,
pages 220–232, Clarendon

more detail, see the book by Laidler and Bunting, as well as
more recent reviews by Northrop and by Masson and Balny),
but it is convenient to mention them brieﬂy, both because
their treatment has some similarities with that of temperature,
and because they can provide valuable information about the
mechanistic details of chemical reactions.

dependence of enzyme catalytic

Biophysica Acta 1724, 440–450
The major difference between temperature and pressure
effects on reactions in liquid solution is that whereas it is easy
to change the rate of a reaction by increasing the tempera-
ture, an increase of a few degrees being usually sufﬁcient
to produce an easily measurable change, large increases in
pressure, typically much more than 100 bar, are necessary
to produce comparable results. This difference results from
the very low compressibility of water and other liquids: to
produce a chemical effect the increase in pressure must alter
22
1. Basic principles of chemical kinetics
the volume occupied by the reacting molecules—something
easy to achieve for reactions in the gas phase, but much more
difﬁcult in the liquid phase.
Another difference is that although enthalpies of activa-
tion are always positive, so all rate constants increase with
temperature, volumes of activation can be either positive or
(more commonly) negative, and so rate constants may change
in either direction with increasing pressure.
Forming the
transition state for any reaction often implies bringing the
reacting molecules into closer proximity than they would be
in a stable system, especially if the reacting groups are ions
of the same sign, but it can also imply bringing them further
apart, especially if they are oppositely charged. These possi-
bilities can be distinguished experimentally by examining the
effect of pressure: increasing the pressure favors formation
of a transition state that occupies a smaller volume than the
ground state, so the reaction should be accelerated by in-
creased pressure and has a negative volume of activation, which
is deﬁned in analogy to the entropy and enthalpy of activation
as the molar volume change that accompanies formation of
the transition state. Conversely, if the transition state occupies
a larger volume than the ground state its formation will be
retarded by increased pressure, and the reaction will show a
positive volume of activation.
Effects on the solvent molecules can make the major con-
tribution to the magnitudes of volumes of activation, just as
they can for those of entropies of activation, and in chemical
reactions the values of the two parameters are often highly
correlated, as discussed by Laidler and Bunting in their book.
The same may well apply to enzyme reactions, though it is
made more difﬁcult to establish experimentally by the difﬁ-
culty of studying an enzyme-catalyzed reaction over a wide
enough temperature range to allow accurate estimation of the
entropy of activation, as we shall see in detail in Section 11.5.

Introduction to Enzyme
Kinetics
2.1
The idea of an enzyme–substrate complex
E
DUARD BUCHNER (1860–
1917) is sometimes
regarded as the ﬁrst
biochemist, as the subject
developed after he showed that
a cell-free extract of yeast could
catalyze alcoholic fermentation.
This greatly weakened (and
eventually destroyed) the
vitalist attitudes that dominated
much of biological thinking in
the nineteenth century. Buchner
was born and educated in
Munich and developed his
interest in fermentation under
the inﬂuence of his elder
brother, the bacteriologist Hans
Buchner. He was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in
1907, but his career was brought
to a premature end by his death
from wounds sustained in
action at the Roumanian front.
The rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions were ﬁrst studied
in the latter part of the nineteenth century.
At that time,
no enzyme was available in a pure form, methods of assay
were primitive, and buffers were not used to control what
was later called the pH. Moreover, it was customary to follow
the course of the reaction over a period of time, in contrast to
the more usual modern practice of measuring initial rates at
various different substrate concentrations, which gives results
that are easier to interpret.
Most of the early studies dealt with enzymes from fermen-
tation, particularly invertase1, which catalyzes the hydrolysis
of sucrose:
✲
sucrose + water
glucose + fructose
O’Sullivan and Tompson made a thorough study of this re-
action. They found it to be highly dependent on the acidity
of the mixture and that as long as this “acidity was in the
most favourable proportion”, the rate was proportional to
1Invertase is now usually known as β-fructofuranosidase. However, in
this chapter we are mainly concerned with its historical role in the develop-
ment of enzyme kinetics and it is appropriate to retain the name that was
usual at the time.

expected curve. At low temperatures, invertase showed an
approximate doubling of rate for an increase of temperature
of 10C. However, unlike most ordinary chemical reactions,
the reaction displayed an apparent optimum temperature
(Section 11.3), above which the rate fell rapidly to zero. In-
§11.3, pages 275–276
vertase proved to be a true catalyst, as it was not destroyed
or altered in the reaction (except at high temperatures), and
a sample was still active after catalyzing the hydrolysis of
100 000 times its weight of sucrose. Finally, O’Sullivan and
Tompson noted that the thermal stability of the enzyme was
greatly increased by the presence of its substrate: “Invertase
when in the presence of cane sugar2 will stand a temperature
fully 25C greater than in its absence. This is a very striking
fact, and, as far as we can see, there is only one explana-
tion of it, namely the invertase enters into combination with
the sugar.”
Wurtz had concluded earlier that an enzyme–
substrate complex must be formed in the papain-catalyzed
hydrolysis of ﬁbrin: he had observed a precipitate that he
suggested might be a papain–ﬁbrin compound that acted as
an intermediate in the hydrolysis.

Notice that although the mass
of the enzyme is about 70 times
greater than the combined mass
of the substrates the space
occupied by the substrates is
about a third of the diameter of
the enzyme.
This is a book about kinetics, not about structural aspects
of enzymology, a topic that is treated supremely well in some
other books, such as Fersht’s, but some aspects are best un-
derstood in the context of an idea of enzyme structure. The
enzyme hexokinase D has a molecular mass of about 50 000
Da, and it catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, a 180 Da
molecule, by MgATP, a 531 Da ion. The mass of the enzyme
is thus about 70 times greater than the combined mass of
its substrates, a ratio that provokes a question that has long
been popular among biochemists: why are enzymes so big?
However, this is a misleading question because the ratio of
70 is itself misleading. In everyday life we do not judge the
sizes of objects that we can handle by their masses or their
volumes but by their linear dimensions. To say that one object
is twice as large as another usually means that it is about twice
as long. If we consider the cube root of the ratio of masses,
701/3  4 rather than the ratio itself, we may see in Figure
2.1 that the extent of the space occupied by the substrates
is about a third of the diameter of the enzyme, even more
than the expected value of about a quarter, largely because

the enzyme is globular in shape whereas the substrates are
more extended. The point here is that we should resist the
temptation to think of enzymes as huge molecules that are
enormous compared with their substrates. This may be true
of some, but in general an enzyme has a similar relationship
to its substrates as a precision tool in everyday life has to the
object it is designed to act on.

Bowden (editor, 1997) New Beer
in an Old Bottle, Universitat de
València, Valencia, Spain
in a purely kinetic context.
In common with a number of
other workers, he found that the rates of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions deviated from second-order kinetics.
Initially, he
showed that the rate of hydrolysis of sucrose in fermenta-
tion by live yeast appeared to be independent of the sucrose
concentration.3
The conﬂict between his results and those
of O’Sullivan and Tompson was not at ﬁrst regarded as se-
rious, because catalysis by isolated enzymes was regarded
as fundamentally different from fermentation by living or-
ganisms, as physiological chemistry was still dominated by
ideas of vitalism. Despite cogent opposition from Berthelot
(1860), the support of Pasteur for vitalism meant that it was
not ﬁnally overthrown until the end of the century, when
Buchner showed that a cell-free (nonliving) extract of yeast
could catalyze alcoholic fermentation.
This work can be regarded as the creation of biochemistry
as a distinct science, and it prompted Brown to reexamine
his earlier results. After conﬁrming that he could reproduce
them he showed that puriﬁed invertase behaved in a similar
way. He suggested that involvement of an enzyme–substrate
complex in the mechanism placed a limit on the rate that
could be achieved: provided that the complex existed for a
brief instant of time before breaking down to products, then
a maximum rate would be reached when the substrate con-
centration was high enough for all the enzyme to be present
as enzyme–substrate complex. The rate at which complex is
formed would become signiﬁcant at lower concentrations of
substrate, and the rate of hydrolysis would then depend on
the substrate concentration.

collected in convenient form as translations or reprints by
Boyde and by Friedmann, as detailed in Table 2.1.
3With the modern view of the kinetic behavior of multienzyme systems
discussed in Chapter 13 we have no need of vitalism to explain why a whole
cell may behave differently from a puriﬁed enzyme.

The Michaelis–Menten equation
Henri criticized Brown’s model of enzyme action on the
grounds that it assumed a ﬁxed lifetime for the enzyme–
substrate complex between its abrupt creation and decay. He
proposed instead a mechanism that was conceptually similar
to Brown’s but which was expressed in more precise mathe-
matical and chemical terms, with an equilibrium between the
free enzyme and the enzyme–substrate and enzyme–product
complexes.
V
ICTOR HENRI (1872–1940)
was born in Marseilles,
but was adopted as an
orphan by Russian aristocratic
parents, who took him to St
Petersburg in 1880. He was
educated at the German school
in St Petersburg, and afterwards
in Paris. He obtained his ﬁrst
doctorate (on tactile sensations)
at Göttingen. His doctorate on
enzymes was granted by the
Sorbonne on the basis of his
thesis entitled Les lois générales
de l’action des diastases, in which
he developed his ideas on
enzyme catalysis and kinetics.
He was highly active through-
out his remarkably varied
career, which included periods
in Paris, Leipzig, Moscow,
Zürich and Liège, and he pub-
lished more than 500 papers.
His later work was mainly in
physical chemistry, but he also
made contributions to other
ﬁelds and collaborated with
Alfred Binet, the pioneer in
intelligence testing, with whom
he wrote a book on intellectual
fatigue. A full account of his
career is provided by S. Nicolas
(1994) “Qui était Victor Henri
(1872–1940)?” L’année Psycho-
logique 94, 385–402.
Although Brown and Henri reached essentially correct
conclusions, they did so on the basis of experiments that
were open to serious objections.
O’Sullivan and Tompson
experienced great difﬁculty in obtaining coherent results until
they realized the importance of acid concentration. Brown
prepared the enzyme in a different way and found the ad-
dition of acid to be unnecessary (presumably his solutions
were sufﬁciently buffered by the natural components of the
yeast), and Henri did not discuss the problem. Apart from
O’Sullivan and Tompson, the early investigators of invertase
made no allowance for the mutarotation of the glucose pro-
duced in the reaction, although this certainly affected their
results because they used polarimetric methods for following
the reaction.

centration, expressed by Sørensen’s logarithmic scale of pH,

lowed for the mutarotation of the product and they measured
initial rates of the reaction at different substrate concentra-
tions. When initial rates are used, complicating factors such as
the reverse reaction, product inhibition and inactivation of the
enzyme can be avoided and much simpler rate equations can
be used. In spite of these reﬁnements their results agreed well
with Henri’s, and they proposed a mechanism essentially the

EONOR MICHAELIS (1875–
1949) was born in Berlin.
He worked for a year as
assistant to Paul Ehrlich, and
afterwards studied clinical
medicine and developed an
early interest in controlling the
hydrogen ion concentration. In
the years preceding the First
World War he used his mastery
of this subject to become one of
the leaders in studying enzyme-
catalyzed reactions. This was an
impressively productive period
for him, and his best-known
paper is just one of 94 publica-
tions, including ﬁve books, in
the ﬁve years from 1910 to 1914.
Several of his papers from these
years are still cited, and one of
the books, Die Wasserstofﬁonen-
konzentration, became the stand-
ard work on pH, buffers and
related topics. In the 1920s he
spent three years as professor of
biochemistry in Nagoya, Japan,
and subsequently moved to the
USA; from 1926 to 1929 he was
at the Johns Hopkins Univers-
ity, and afterwards he was at
the Rockefeller Institute for
Medical Research. Until the end
of his life he remained active in
research, concerned mainly
with the study of free radicals.
In addition to his scientiﬁc
achievements, Michaelis was a
violinist of near-professional
standard. Azzi relates that
during his time in Japan he was
asked by Shinichi Suzuki, the
son of a violin maker, if he was
suited to a career as a soloist.
Michaelis advised him to go
into teaching, thereby catalyz-
ing the birth of the Suzuki
method of teaching the violin.

same as his, which may be written with modern symbolism4
as follows:
E + A ⇋EA →E + P
(2.1)
Like Henri, they assumed that the reversible ﬁrst step was fast
enough to be represented by an equilibrium constant for sub-
strate dissociation, Ks = ea/x, in which x is the concentration
of the intermediate EA, so that x = ea/Ks. The instantaneous
concentrations of free enzyme and substrate, e and a respec-
tively, are not directly measurable, however, and so they must
be expressed in terms of the initial measured concentrations
e0 and a0, using the stoichiometric relationships e0 = e + x
and a0 = a + x. From the ﬁrst of these, x cannot be greater
than e0, and so, if a0 is much larger than e0 it must also be
much larger than x. So a = a0 with good accuracy, and the
expression for x becomes x = (e0 −x)a0/Ks, which can be
rearranged to give
x =
e0
(Ks/a0) + 1 =
e0
(Ks/a) + 1
(2.2)
The second step in the reaction, EA →E + P, is a simple ﬁrst-
order reaction, with a rate constant that may be deﬁned as k2,
so that
v = k2x =
k2e0
(Ks/a) + 1 = k2e0a
Ks + a
(2.3)
Michaelis and Menten showed that this theory, and equa-
tion 2.3, could account accurately for their results with inver-
tase. Because of the deﬁnitive nature of their experiments,
which have served as a standard for most later enzyme-
kinetic measurements, they are regarded as the founders of
modern enzymology, and equation 2.3 (in its modern form,

literature. However, the symbol for substrate presents more variability. Here
I use A, which is more convenient than S when more than one substrate needs
to be deﬁned, as one can continue A, B, C... as needed in a natural way;
however, many authors use S rather than A.

Menten equation.
Henri had derived similar equations earlier, and some
authors believe that his contribution is commonly underval-
ued. The essential point (which applies with equal force to
theoretical advances today), is that it is not enough to arrive
at the correct results; one must do so on the basis of well
designed experiments that justify the conclusions drawn.

AUD LEONORA MENTEN
(1879–1960) was born
in Port Lambton,
Ontario, and in 1911 at the Uni-
versity of Toronto she became
one of the ﬁrst Canadian
women to be qualiﬁed in medi-
cine, from which she went on to
obtain a PhD at the University
of Chicago for aspects of cancer
biochemistry. Her work with
Leonor Michaelis on invertase
was an interlude in a career
devoted mostly to pathology
and the more medical aspects of
biochemistry and physiology.
She was the ﬁrst to use electro-
phoretic mobility to study
human hemoglobins. She spent
most of her working life at the
University of Pittsburgh, but
went back to Canada after her
retirement, where her research
continued at the Medical Insti-
tute of British Columbia until it
was brought to an end by ill
health. She then returned to
Ontario to spend the remainder
of her life not far from where
she was born.
J
AMES BATCHELLER SUMNER
(1887-1955) lost the use of
his left hand in an accident
while still a boy, but although
he was left-handed this disabili-
ty did not prevent him from
becoming an accomplished
experimental chemist. Already
convinced of the protein nature
of enzymes, he embarked In
1917 on a program to purify an
enzyme. He chose jack-bean
urease, an enzyme familiar to
him from his doctoral research,
and after nine years he was able
to obtain it in a crystalline state.
This result was not immediately
accepted, as Richard Willstätter
and others continued to argue
that the protein associate with
an enzyme was just a “carrier”
for the true enzyme, a much
smaller molecule, but 20 years
afterwards he was awarded the
Nobel Prize for his work.
Michaelis and Menten did this, but Henri, and other pre-
cursors such as Brown, did not. Henri did not reach Michaelis
and Menten’s essential insight of recognizing that analysis in
terms of initial rates was much simpler than struggling with
time courses, but he did write the following equation for the
rate of reaction:
dx
dt =
KΦ(a −x)
1 + m(a −x) + nx
(2.4)
in which a was the total amount of sucrose, x was the amount
of product at time t, Φ was the amount of enzyme, and K,
m and n were constants. If concentrations are treated as pro-
portional to amounts, then putting the initial-rate condition
x = 0 into this equation and making appropriate changes
to the symbols makes it identical to equation 2.3.
In his
paper Henri stopped at equation 2.4, but in his doctoral the-
sis he introduced the initial-rate condition and commented
that the hyperbolic form of the dependence of initial rate
on sucrose concentration agreed well with the experimental
results. He also considered the possibility of inhibition by
product present at time zero, and wrote an equation for it that
is equivalent to equation 2.42 below (Section 2.8).
At about the same time as Michaelis and Menten were
working, Van Slyke and Cullen obtained similar results with
the enzyme urease.5
They assumed a similar mechanism,
with the important difference that they assumed that the ﬁrst
step was irreversible:

5Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia
in bacteria and plants. In 1926 Sumner made it the ﬁrst enzyme to be obtained
in a crystalline state. The observation that an enzyme could be crystallized
was an important step in demonstrating that enzymes were proteins, some-
thing that had been generally accepted at the end of the 19th century, but
which in the heyday of “colloid chemistry” had become controversial.

diate concentration was constant, so dx/dt = 0, and hence
k1(e0 −x)a −k2x = 0, which may be rearranged to give
x = k1e0a/(k2 + k1a); substituting this into the rate equation
v = k2x gives
v = k2x = k1k2e0a
k2 + k1a = k2e0a

This equation is of the same form as equation 2.3, with k2/k1
instead of Ks (which would be k−1/k1 if the rate constants
in equation 2.1 were numbered) and is empirically indistin-
guishable from it. As k1a is a pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant
and k2 is a ﬁrst-order rate constant they are both reciprocal
times, and Van Slyke and Cullen interpreted
1
k1a + 1

as the time needed to complete a reaction cycle.

return to this interpretation in Section 14.1.3.

place in the understanding of enzyme catalysis, Langmuir

was reaching similar ideas about the adsorption of gases on
solids. His treatment was much more general, but the case he
referred to as simple adsorption corresponds closely to the type
of binding assumed by Henri and by Michaelis and Menten.
Langmuir recognized the similarity between solid surfaces
and enzymes, although he imagined the whole surface of an
enzyme to be “active”, rather than limited areas or active sites.
Hitchcock pointed out the similarity between the equations
for the binding of ligands to solid surfaces and to proteins,
and the logical process was completed when Lineweaver and
Burk6 extended Hitchcock’s ideas to catalysis.

but for a quite different reason that we shall come to later in this chapter in
Section 2.6.2.

The steady state of an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction
2.3.1
The Briggs–Haldane treatment
Whether we treat the ﬁrst step of enzyme catalysis as an equi-
librium or as an irreversible reaction, we make unwarranted
and unnecessary assumptions about the magnitudes of the
rate constants. As we have seen, both formulations lead to
the same form of the rate equation, and Briggs and Haldane
G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane
(1925) “A note on the kinetics of
enzyme action” Biochemical
Journal 19, 338–339
examined a more general mechanism that includes both as
special cases:
✲
✛
E +
A
EA
✲E + P
k1
k−1
k2
e0 −x
a

(2.6)
This leads to the following rate equation:
dx
dt = k1(e0 −x)a −k−1x −k2x
(2.7)
Briggs and Haldane argued that a steady state would be
reached in which the concentration of intermediate was con-
stant, with dx/dt = 0; then
k1(e0 −x)a −k−1x −k2x = 0
(2.8)
Collecting terms in x and rearranging leads to the following
expression for the steady-state value of x:
x =
k1e0a
k−1 + k2 + k1a
(2.9)
As before, the rate is given by v = k2x:
v =
k1k2e0a
k−1 + k2 + k1a =
k2e0a
k−1 + k2
k1
+ a
(2.10)
If the Briggs–Haldane treatment is presented in this way it
is easy to be seduced into believing that it is more general than
that of Michaelis and Menten, and innumerable textbooks
(including the ﬁrst edition of this one) have indeed suggested
that it is the “right” approach that has superseded the more
“naive” one of Michaelis and Menten. In reality, however,
there are two serious objections to equation 2.6 that leave it
as only a slight improvement on equations 2.1 and 2.5: ﬁrst,
it treats the whole reaction as irreversible, whereas all real
2.3 The steady state
33
enzyme-catalyzed reactions are reversible; second, it shows
only one intermediate complex, with substrate bound to en-
zyme, which means that the mechanism treats substrate and
product in a way that is conceptually unsymmetrical. I shall
return to these points in Section 2.7. Meanwhile, the proper
§2.7, pages 54–61
lesson to draw from this section is not that equation 2.10
shows the “right” way to write the kinetic equation for a one-
substrate reaction, but that unless there is good evidence for a
preequilibrium one should analyze any mechanism in terms
of the steady-state assumption.
2.3.2
Parameters of the Michaelis–Menten equation
Equation 2.10 can be written in the following more general
form
v = kcate0a
Km + a
(2.11)
in which k2 has been written as kcat (for reasons that will be
considered shortly) and (k−1 + k2)/k1 as Km, the Michaelis
constant. This is the Michaelis–Menten equation7, the funda-
mental equation of enzyme kinetics. The name is nowadays
applied to the equation derived using the steady-state as-
sumption, not to the form obtained by Michaelis and Menten
using the equilibrium assumption.
Equation 2.11 is more
general than equation 2.10, which was derived for a particular
mechanism, equation 2.6, and it applies to many mechanisms
more complex than the simplest two-step Michaelis–Menten
mechanism. That is why k2 of equation 2.10 was replaced by
kcat; in general one cannot assume that kcat is equivalent to the
rate constant for the second step of the reaction or that Km is
equivalent to (k−1 + k2)/k1.
Although kcat may not refer to a single step of a mecha-
nism, it does have the properties of a ﬁrst-order rate constant,
deﬁning the capacity of the enzyme–substrate complex, once
formed, to form product. It is known as the catalytic constant,
symbolized by kcat (or sometimes as k0). It is also sometimes
called the turnover number, because it is a reciprocal time and
deﬁnes the number of catalytic cycles (or “turnovers”) the
enzyme can undergo in unit time, or the number of molecules
of substrate that one molecule of enzyme can convert into
products in one unit of time.
7Authors who do not agree with the reasons set out in the preceding
section for giving all the credit to Michaelis and Menten call it the Henri–
Michaelis–Menten equation, but this terminology is much less common than
the one used here.

2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
At least in the early stages of investigating an enzyme,
the true enzyme molarity e0 is usually unknown, which com-
plicates use of the Michaelis–Menten equation in the form
shown as equation 2.11. The difﬁculty is commonly avoided
by combining kcat and e0 into a single constant V = kcate0, the
limiting rate, which because of its dependence on the enzyme
concentration is not a fundamental property of the enzyme. Thus

terminology a maximum is not

tote), but the distinction is often
blurred in biochemical usage.
it is often convenient to write the Michaelis–Menten equation
as follows:
v =
Va
Km + a
(2.12)
To avoid confusion with lower-case v, the usual symbol for a
rate, capital V is usually spoken aloud as “vee-max”, and is
sometimes printed as Vmax or Vm. These terms and symbols
derive from the old name (still often used) of maximum velocity
for V, now discouraged by the International Union of Bio-
chemistry and Molecular Biology because it does not deﬁne
International Union of Bio-
chemistry (1982) “Symbolism
and terminology in enzyme
kinetics” European Journal of
Biochemistry 128, 281–291
a maximum in the mathematical sense but a limit (Figure
2.2). The symbol Vm is especially to be avoided because it
misleadingly suggests that the subscript m corresponds to the
one in Km.8 In fact, the m in Km stands for Michaelis, and it
was the former and more logical custom to write it as KM.
Notice that in equation 2.12 Km is added to a, a concentration:
this tells us immediately that it must itself be a concentration,
and its meaning will be discussed in Section 2.3.4.
§2.3.4, pages 35–37
The crucial difference between equation 2.12 and the sim-
pler equations discussed in Chapter 1 is the presence of the
Chapter 1, pages 1–24
denominator Km + a, which means that the reaction cannot
have a simple order with respect to a.
2.3.3
Units of enzyme activity
For enzymes whose molar concentration cannot be measured,
either because the enzyme has not been puriﬁed or because its
molecular mass is unknown, it is often convenient to deﬁne
a unit of catalytic activity.
The traditional “unit” of enzy-
mologists (often symbolized as IU, for “international unit”)
is the amount of enzyme that can catalyze the transformation
of 1 µmol of substrate into products in 1 min under standard
conditions. This unit is still in common use, because the corre-
sponding unit in the International System9 of units, the katal,

sures in 1960 (see International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), and

symbolized as kat, has not been widely accepted. A perceived
problem is that 1 kat, the amount of activity sufﬁcient to cata-
lyze the transformation of 1 mol of substrate into products
in 1 s under standard conditions, is regarded as being exces-
sively large, though more severe objections to the farad as the
unit of capacitance have not prevented its general acceptance
by electrical engineers. In any case there are submultiples of
the katal, such as 1 µkat = 60 units or 1 nkat = 0.06 unit, that
are convenient in magnitude for laboratory use.

The curve deﬁned by equation 2.12 is shown in Figure 2.3.
It is a rectangular hyperbola through the origin, with asymp-
totes a = −Km and v = V. (The relationship between this

and the reaction is approximately second-order overall, ﬁrst-
order10 in a. As kcat/Km has this fundamental meaning as the
second-order rate constant for the reaction E + A →E + P at
low substrate concentrations, it should not be regarded just
as the result of dividing kcat by Km.
It is given the name
speciﬁcity constant, for reasons that will be explained shortly
(Section 2.4), and may be symbolized as kA, where the sub-
§2.4, pages 38–43
script, A in this example, indicates which substrate it refers
to. The reciprocal of V/Km, or Km/V, has dimensions of time
and may be called the speciﬁcity time. It is the time that would
be required to consume all of the substrate if the enzyme were
acting under ﬁrst-order conditions and maintained the same
initial rate indeﬁnitely (Cornish-Bowden, 1987).

tions, it makes more sense in relation to the cell, where many

the same rate for long periods (because their substrates are
replenished): in these circumstances the speciﬁcity time is the
time required to replace all of the substrate.
§1.2, pages 3–9
When a is equal to Km, equation 2.12 simpliﬁes to the
following:
v = Va/2a = 0.5V
Thus the rate has half of its limiting value in these conditions,
and Km can be deﬁned as the concentration at which v = 0.5V.
This is an operational deﬁnition that applies regardless of the
particular mechanism to which the Michaelis–Menten equa-
tion is applied.
At very large values of a the denominator of the right-
hand side of equation 2.12 is dominated by a, so Km is neg-
ligible in comparison with a and the equation simpliﬁes to
v ≈kcate0 = V
The reaction is now approximately zero order in a, all of the
active sites of the enzyme are occupied by the substrate and it
is said to be saturated. This is the reason for the name limiting
rate for V.
In many textbooks of biochemistry, and even in some
specialist books on enzyme kinetics, the plot of v against a
is drawn badly enough to be highly misleading.
Students
are easily given a quite wrong impression of the shape of the
curve, suggesting that V can be estimated from such a plot
of experimental observations by ﬁnding the point at which v
“reaches” its limiting value. The main fault lies in drawing

a curve that ﬂattens out too abruptly and then drawing an

never reaches V at a ﬁnite value of a, as ought to be clear from
examination of equation 2.12, and even when a = 10Km (a
higher concentration than is used in many experiments) the
value of v is still almost 10% less than V. This point may
perhaps be grasped more clearly by examining a much greater
proportion of the curve deﬁned by equation 2.12 than is given
in Figure 2.3: such a view may be seen in Figure 2.5, which

usual two-limb hyperbolas found in mathematics textbooks,
and it also shows that when one estimates Km and V from a

point of intersection of the two asymptotes of an inﬁnite curve
from observations along a short arc. It is for this reason that

requires considerable care: I shall return to it in Section 2.6

and again in Chapter 15.
2.3.5
Mutual depletion kinetics
In deriving equation 2.10 we assumed that the substrate was
in sufﬁcient excess over the enzyme that one could treat the
free and total substrate concentrations as identical. Kinetic
experiments are usually carried out in conditions where this
assumption is valid, but in experiments at unusually high
enzyme concentrations or low substrate concentrations it may
be necessary to distinguish between the free and total sub-
strate concentrations as a and a0 respectively. One must then
replace a in equation 2.7 by a0 −x, because the substrate
concentration as well as the enzyme concentration is depleted
by formation of enzyme–substrate complex. This leads, in-
stead of equation 2.8, to an equation that contains x2 when
multiplied out, a quadratic and not a linear equation for x.
As this type of system has greater practical importance
for tight-binding inhibitors than for substrates, we shall defer
more detailed examination until Chapter 7. For the moment it
Chapter 7, pages 169–188
is sufﬁcient to note that when substrate depletion is taken into
account the (total) substrate concentration at which v = 0.5V
is not Km but Km + 0.5e0 (compare equation 7.3).11

tions with a0 ≫e0). As Km =
0.5e0(a0 −0.5e0)/0.5e0 it
follows that a0 = Km + 0.5e0.
2.3.6
Ways of writing the Michaelis–Menten
equation
As we have seen, there are three parameters that can be con-
sidered as parameters of the form of the Michaelis–Menten
equation that applies when the enzyme concentration e0 is
known: the catalytic constant kcat, the speciﬁcity constant
kA, and the Michaelis constant Km. As these are related by
the identity kA ≡kcat/Km it is evident that as alternatives
to equation 2.11 the Michaelis–Menten equation can be ex-
pressed in terms of kcat and kA:
v = kcatkAe0a
kcat + kAa
(2.13)
11The free substrate concentration for v = 0.5V is still Km, but if 0.5e0 exists
as enzyme–substrate complex then the same amount of substrate must also
exist as enzyme–substrate complex, so the total is Km + 0.5e0, as explained in
Figure 2.6.

or in terms of kA and Km:

(2.14)
The usual formulation in terms of kcat and Km owes more to
history than anything else, and is in no way more fundamen-
tal than equations 2.13–2.14.
The study of enzymes might
well have been more convenient if the subject had developed
differently and equation 2.13 had become the most familiar
form of the Michaelis–Menten equation: this would simplify
discussion of numerous aspects of the subject, such as the
different kinds of inhibition (Chapters 6 and 7), reactions with

multiple substrates (Chapter 8), effects of pH (Chapter 10) and
the estimation of parameters by graphical or statistical means
(Chapter 15). Nonetheless, in this book I follow the usual
practice of writing it as equation 2.11 or 2.12, because these
are by far the commonest forms in the research literature.
Regardless of how the equation itself is written, the essen-
tial point of this discussion is that the fundamental param-
eters of the Michaelis–Menten equation are kcat and kA, and
many aspects of enzyme behavior are most easily understood
as effects on one or other of them. Rather than thinking of
kA as a derived quantity, therefore, it is better to think of it as
fundamental, so that Km is best thought of as the ratio kcat/kA.

Speciﬁcity
2.4.1
The fundamental property of enzymes
It is natural to be impressed by the capacity of enzymes to
act as highly efﬁcient catalysts: they permit reactions that for
practical purposes do not occur at all under ordinary condi-
tions, such as the decarboxylation of orotidine 5′-phosphate,
a reaction that Radzicka and Wolfenden estimated to have
A. Radzicka and R. Wolfenden
(1995) “A proﬁcient enzyme”
Science 267, 90–93
a ﬁrst-order rate constant of 3 × 10−16 s−1 for spontaneous
decomposition in neutral aqueous solution at 25◦C ; they ac-
celerate reactions that are already fast without a catalyst, such
as the dehydration of bicarbonate, for which the correspond-
ing rate constant is 0.13 s−1. Both reactions are catalyzed by
speciﬁc enzymes, the ﬁrst by orotidine 5′-phosphate decar-
boxylase and the second by carbonic anhydrase. Radzicka
and Wolfenden introduced the idea of catalytic proﬁciency as a
measure of the capacity of an enzyme to accelerate a reaction
beyond its uncatalyzed rate, and by their criteria orotidine
2.4 Speciﬁcity
39
5′-phosphate decarboxylase is a highly proﬁcient enzyme.
However, it is not evident that accelerating a slow process
is necessarily more difﬁcult than accelerating a fast one, and
experience in human affairs would suggest the opposite: the
arrangement of large rocks into monuments was achieved
around 4000 years ago, even though the process does not
occur naturally at a perceptible rate, whereas the routine
transport of goods and people at more than twice the speed
of a galloping horse was achieved much more recently. In
any case, virtually any reaction can be accelerated, essen-
tially without limit, by carrying it out at high temperature
under extreme conditions, a property that was, of course,
exploited by Radzicka and Wolfenden when they estimated
the uncatalyzed decarboxylation of orotidine 5′-phosphate.
What should impress us, therefore, about enzymes is not that
they are excellent catalysts for certain reactions but that they
are extremely poor catalysts for the overwhelming majority
of other reactions: orotidine 5′-phosphate decarboxylase, for
example, is a useless catalyst for dehydration of bicarbonate,
even though that is also a decarboxylation reaction. In other
words, what should impress us about enzymes is their speci-
ﬁcity. To study this, however, we need to deﬁne the term
precisely.
2.4.2
Discrimination between mixed substrates
Experimental investigations of enzymes are usually done
with only one substrate present in the reaction mixture at a
time, without any alternative substrates able to undergo the
same reaction. This is not at all the same as saying that the
enzyme requires two or more substrates for the reaction to be
complete (Figure 2.7). For example, hexokinase catalyzes a
reaction between glucose and ATP, in which glucose and ATP
are not alternatives to one another but are both separately
required for the reaction to be possible, so this requirement as
such has nothing to do with competition between substrates.
On the other hand hexokinase will accept fructose and other
hexoses as alternatives to glucose, and if both glucose and
fructose are simultaneously present they are competing sub-
strates.

The reason for studying one substrate at a time is that
competing substrates tend to complicate the analysis, usually
without providing more information than would be obtained
by studying the substrates separately. However, this implies
an important difference between experimental practice and
40
2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
the physiological conditions in which enzymes usually exist:
most enzymes are not perfectly speciﬁc for a single substrate
and must often select between several that are available si-
multaneously. To be physiologically meaningful, therefore,
enzyme speciﬁcity must be deﬁned in terms of how well the
enzyme can discriminate between substrates present in the
same reaction mixture.
This interpretation of the meaning of speciﬁcity follows
from Fersht’s thorough discussion, in which he set out to an-

swer the biologically important question of how aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetases, enzymes involved in protein synthesis,
can distinguish between structurally similar substrates, such
as valine, threonine and isoleucine (Figure 2.8) and avoid hav-
ing an intolerable frequency of errors. Fersht’s interpretation
is now widely accepted and I shall adopt it in this book, but
at the end of this section I shall mention some objections that
have been raised. None of this means that the speciﬁcity of
an enzyme cannot be determined by studying the different
substrates separately, but it does mean that the parameters
for the individual substrates need to be interpreted correctly
and not casually.

shall see in Section 6.2.1, each equation is exactly of the form
§6.2.1, pages 134–136
of equation 6.1, the equation for competitive inhibition, so, if
one measures the speciﬁc “inhibition constant” for a competi-
tive substrate by treating it as if it were an inhibitor, the value
that results is its Michaelis constant. This is illustrated in Ta-
ble 2.2, which shows Km values for several poor substrates of
fumarase measured both directly and in competing reactions.
In each case the values of Km measured in the two ways agree
to within experimental error.
A more important point about equations 2.16–2.17, also
illustrated by the data in Table 2.2, is that they provide the
basis for a rigorous deﬁnition of enzyme speciﬁcity. Consider
the parameters for ﬂuorofumarate and for fumarate.
The
value of kcat for ﬂuorofumarate is about three times that for
fumarate; thus at high concentrations ﬂuorofumarate appears
to be a better substrate than fumarate, if the two reactions are
considered in isolation. The reverse is true at low concen-
trations, however, because kcat/Km is about 60% greater for
fumarate than for ﬂuorofumarate. Which of these results is
more fundamental? Which is the more speciﬁc substrate? The
question may seem to be just one of deﬁnition, but a clear and
42
2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
satisfying answer emerges when one realizes that it is artiﬁcial
to consider the two substrates in isolation from one another.
In most physiological discussions of speciﬁcity one ought to
consider the proportion of reaction using each substrate when
they are mixed together, which can be determined by dividing
equation 2.16 by equation 2.17:
v
v′ = dp
dp′ = (V/Km)a
(V′/K′m)a′ = (kcat/Km)a
(k′
cat/K′m)a′ = kAa
k′
Aa′
(2.18)
This shows why the name speciﬁcity constant for the parameter
kA = kcat/Km introduced in Section 2.3.4 is not arbitrary,
§2.3.4, pages 35–37
because it is indeed the parameter that determines the ra-
tio of rates for competing substrates when they are mixed
together, and it thus expresses the ability of an enzyme to
discriminate in favor of any substrate A in the presence of
others. It follows, therefore, that in an equimolar mixture of
fumarate and ﬂuorofumarate, at any concentration, the rate
of the fumarase-catalyzed hydration of fumarate is 60% faster
than the hydration of ﬂuorofumarate, and that fumarate is
therefore the more speciﬁc substrate.
Brot and Bender were apparently the ﬁrst to use the term

(1969) “Use of the speciﬁcity
constant of α-chymotrypsin”
Journal of the American Chemical
Society 91, 7187–7191
“speciﬁcity constant” for kcat/Km, but they reached their con-
clusion that it provides the best measure of speciﬁcity by
arguments quite different from those discussed here. They
did not consider what now seems the crucial question of
how an enzyme can discriminate between substrates that are
present simultaneously.
Instead they were primarily con-
cerned with the problems caused by nonproductive binding
(Section 6.9.1). Moreover, like most of the people who have
§6.9.1, pages 159–162
studied α-chymotrypsin they worked exclusively with small
unnatural substrates, so the question of physiological signiﬁ-
cance did not arise.

Koshland argued that a parameter known as a speciﬁcity con-
stant ought to “provide a means of contrasting the speciﬁcities
of different enzymes towards their substrates”, to compare,
for example, the speciﬁcity of a kinase for different carbohy-
drate substrates with that of a proteinase for different pep-
tide substrates. As discussed in Section 12.4, he had been,
§12.4, pages 302–304
with his theory of induced ﬁt, responsible for the ﬁrst major
advance in understanding enzyme speciﬁcity after Fischer’s
lock-and-key model, so his opinion cannot be lightly dis-
missed.
Nonetheless, Fersht’s interpretation appears to be
2.5 Validity of the steady-state assumption
43
more appropriate for analyzing the physiological problems
that natural selection has had to solve.
We have been concerned here only with discrimination
between substrates that are mixed together, but there has
been a regrettable tendency to use kcat/Km, for comparing
different enzymes as catalysts, such as mutant forms of an
enzyme obtained by genetic manipulation, and not just for
comparing different substrates for the same enzyme. Eisen-
thal and co-workers have pointed out that this can sometimes
lead to incorrect conclusions, because enzymes with the same

value of kcat/Km and acting on the same substrate may have
different rate ratios at different substrate concentrations, and
the enzyme with the higher value of kcat/Km may still give
the lower rate in some concentration range. Put simply, the
enzyme with the higher value of kcat/Km will give the faster
reaction at low substrate concentrations, whereas the enzyme
with the higher value of kcat will give the faster reaction at
high substrate concentrations (Figure 2.9): as there is no ne-
cessity for these two conditions to agree, there is no necessity

for the enzyme with the higher value of kcat/Km to give the
faster reaction over the whole concentration range. It follows,
therefore, that its use as a measure of speciﬁcity should not
be generalized beyond the original idea of comparing the
kinetics of different substrates for the same enzyme.
2.5
Validity of the steady-state assumption
In deriving equation 2.11 it was assumed that a steady state
would be reached in which dx/dt = 0. In fact, however,
equation 2.7 is readily integrable if a is treated as a constant,
and it is instructive to derive a rate equation without making
the steady-state assumption, because this sheds some light on
the validity of the assumption. Separating the two variables,
x and t, we have


k1e0a −(k1a + k−1 + k2)x =

dt
(2.19)
Despite its complicated appearance, the left-hand side is just
the integral of dx divided by the sum of a constant and a
term proportional to x, so it has the same simple form as

value in practice), then the exponential term is less than 0.01
for values of t greater than 5 ms: in other words equation 2.20
should become indistinguishable from the Michaelis–Menten
equation after a lag # of a few milliseconds. The rate then
decreases much more slowly, in the progress-curve phase, as
illustrated in Figures 2.10–11.
In deriving equation 2.20 the substrate concentration a
was treated as a constant, but that is not strictly accurate
because a must change as the reaction proceeds. However,
provided that a0 is much greater than e0, as it usually is in
steady-state experiments, the change in a during the time

neglected without signiﬁcant inaccuracy. Laidler derived an
equation similar to equation 2.20 as a special case of a more

general treatment in which he allowed for a to decrease from
its initial value a0. He found that a steady state was achieved
in which
v =
V(a0 −p)
Km + a0 −p
(2.21)
This is the same as equation 2.12 apart from the replacement
of a with a0 −p.
It may seem contradictory to refer to a steady state in
which v must decrease as p increases, but this decrease in
v is extremely slow compared with the rapid increase in v
that occurs in the transient phase, the period in which equa-
tion 2.20 must be used, before the steady state is established.12
The argument of Briggs and Haldane is hardly altered by
replacing the assumption that dx/dt = 0 with an assump-
tion that dx/dt is very small: equation 2.8 becomes a good
approximation instead of being exact. As Wong pointed out,
J. T. Wong (1975) Kinetics of
Enzyme Mechanisms, pages
10–13, Academic Press, London
what matters is not the absolute magnitude of dx/dt but its
magnitude relative to k1e0a.
This example illustrates the relationship between math-
ematics and science. From the mathematical point of view
equation 2.19 cannot be integrated unless a is a constant.
Nonetheless, equation 2.20, obtained without treating a as
a constant, is so accurate in practice that it would be quite
difﬁcult to devise an experiment to detect any deviations
from its predictions. The point is that it requires experience
with enzymes and their kinetic behavior, not mathematical
expertise, to know what simplifying assumptions can safely
be made.

Plotting v against a
When several initial rates are measured at different substrate
concentrations, graphical display of the results allows the
values of the kinetic parameters and the precision of the ex-
periment to be visually assessed. The most obvious way is
to plot v against a, as in Figure 2.3. This is unsatisfactory in
practice, however, for several reasons: it is difﬁcult to draw
a rectangular hyperbola accurately; it is difﬁcult to locate the
asymptotes correctly (because one is tempted to place them
too close to the curve—see Figure 2.4); it is difﬁcult to perceive

occur.

and instead plotted v against log a, as in Figure 2.12. They
understood an important point that often goes unnoticed to-
day, and which can be seen in their plot: the value of log a at
which the maximum slope occurs is not at all obvious from
inspecting the graph, so it is not obvious where to place the
value of log Km, and it is equally unclear where to put the
limit, or V. On the other hand, the slope remains close to
its maximum value over a wide range and can be estimated
easily from the graph. Accordingly they determined how the
value of this maximum slope is related to the limiting rate V.
Differentiation of equation 2.12 with respect to ln a yields the
following equation:
dv
d ln a = adv
da =
KmVa
(Km + a)2
However, as they used not ln a but log a as abscissa variable
they modiﬁed it to take account of the value of ln 10 = 2.303:
dv
d log a = 2.303KmVa
(Km + a)2
and as the maximum slope occurs at a = Km its value must
be 2.303V/4, or 0.576V. Although this may not be the best
method one can devise for estimating V, and hence Km, it is
much better than many methods used by later workers.
The plot of v against log a has an additional advantage
even today, as it allows comparison of the properties of differ-
ent isoenzymes that catalyze the same reaction with widely
different afﬁnities for substrate. Consider, for example, the
plots in Figure 2.13 of v/V for the four isoenzymes of hex-
okinase found in the rat: as hexokinase C and hexokinase

speciﬁcity, and will not be used here.

follows a steeper curve, for which the major variation occurs
within the physiological range. Even if hexokinase D were
omitted the other three differ sufﬁciently from one another to
make such a comparison difﬁcult.

The double-reciprocal plot
H
ANS LINEWEAVER (1907–
2009) is, like his mentor
Dean Burk, known to
biochemists mainly for the
double-reciprocal plot. He was
born in Pickens, West Virginia,
and studied at George Washing-
ton University before obtaining
his doctorate at Johns Hopkins
University. Earlier he was
research assistant at the US
Department of Agriculture
when he carried out his work
with Burk. He spent most of his
career at the Western Regional
Research Laboratory in Albany,
California, where he was chief
of the Poultry Division. When
he died in California at the age
of 101 he was greatgrandfather
of 29, and great-greatgrand-
father of 11.
D
EAN BURK (1904–1988)
is mainly known to
biochemists today for
the double-reciprocal plot, but
he has other claims to fame, not
all of them to his credit. He was
born in San Francisco, and
studied at the University of
California. He spent most of his
career at the National Cancer
Institute as head of the Cyto-
chemistry Sector. He was
awarded the Hillebrand Prize in
1952 for work with Otto
Warburg on photosynthesis.
After he retired in 1974 he was
an active opponent of water
ﬂuoridation, which he called “a
form of public mass murder”,
and proponent of laetrile, a
quack remedy for cancer.
Most workers since Lineweaver and Burk have preferred to

rewrite the Michaelis–Menten equation in ways that allow the
results to be plotted as points on a straight line. The most
commonly used way comes from equation 2.15 by taking
reciprocals of both sides:

The second of these emphasizes the correspondence between
kcat and kA, which is somewhat obscured by the usual choice
48
2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
of V and Km as the parameters of the Michaelis–Menten
equation. Either way, a plot of 1/v against 1/a is a straight
line with slope 1/kAe0 (= Km/V) and intercepts 1/kcate0
(= 1/V) on the 1/v axis and −kA/kcat (= −1/Km) on the 1/a
axis. This plot is commonly known as the Lineweaver–Burk
plot or double-reciprocal plot, and it is illustrated in Figure 2.14.
Although it is by far the most widely used plot in enzyme
kinetics, it cannot be recommended, because it gives a grossly
misleading impression of the experimental error: for small
values of v small errors in v lead to enormous errors in 1/v;
but for large values of v the same small errors in v lead to
barely noticeable errors in 1/v.
This may be judged from
the error bars shown in Figure 2.14, which are noticeably
unsymmetrical even though they were calculated from the
same symmetrical range of errors in v.
Dowd and Riggs drew attention to the capacity of the
double-reciprocal plot to “launder” poor data, to minimize
the appearance but not the reality of scatter; they suggested,
probably rightly, that this accounted for its extraordinary pop-
ularity with biochemists, not much diminished more than 45
years later.

In principle the problems with the double-reciprocal plot
can be overcome by using suitable weights, as described in
Section 15.5.1, but this solution is not altogether satisfactory
§15.5.1, pages 432–433
because it often leads to a “best-ﬁt” line that appears to the eye
to ﬁt badly, as seen in Figure 2.15. Incidentally, Lineweaver
and Burk should not be blamed for the misuse of their plot
by later workers:
they were well aware of the need for
weights and the methods to be used for determining them
(see Lineweaver and Burk, and, especially, Lineweaver, Burk
and Deming). One cannot assume, when authors report that

This is sometimes called a Hanes plot or a Woolf plot. The insets have the same

This shows that a plot of a/v against a should also be a
straight line, with slope 1/kcate0 (= 1/V) and intercepts
1/kAe0 (= Km/V) on the a/v axis and −kcat/kA (= −Km)
on the a axis.14 This plot is sometimes called a Hanes plot or
a Woolf plot, but these names should be used with discretion,
because they are not as universally understood as the name
“Lineweaver–Burk plot” for the double-reciprocal plot. It is
illustrated in Figure 2.16. Over a fair range of a values the
errors in a/v provide a faithful reﬂection of those in v, as
may be judged from the error bars in Figure 2.16: it is for this
reason that the plot of a/v against a should be preferred over
the other straight-line plots whenever the main objective is to
illustrate how well the data agree with the interpretation.
B
ARNET WOOLF (1902–
1980) published several
papers on enzymes,
including one in which he
proposed a theory of enzyme
action that can be considered as
the origin of the ternary-
complex mechanism for a
two-substrate reaction. He is
most remembered today,
however, for work that he did
not publish, the linear trans-
formations of the Michaelis–
Menten equation, which ﬁrst
appeared in the German
translation of the book by his
friend and fellow communist
J. B. S. Haldane. He later
worked as a statistician and
made major contributions to
our understanding of infant
mortality.

line with slope −Km and intercepts V on the v axis and V/Km
on v/a axis. This plot is often called an Eadie–Hofstee plot, and
is illustrated in Figure 2.17. It gives fairly good results in prac-
tice, though the presence of v in both coordinates means that
errors in v affect both of them and cause deviations towards
or away from the origin rather than parallel with the ordinate
axis. This means that if replicate measurements are made at
the same substrate concentration the points in each group of
replicates should lie on lines through the origin, as illustrated
in Figure 2.18. Deviations parallel to one or other axis (Figure
2.19) are impossible.
The plot of v against v/a has the opposite character from
the double-reciprocal plot: instead of making poor data look
better it tends to make good data look worse, as it makes any
deviations of the points from the line more difﬁcult to hide,
especially if there are systematic deviations, as pointed out by
Dowd and Riggs. It follows that it is an excellent plot to use
for detecting deviations from Michaelis–Menten behavior.

to use the double-reciprocal plot). However, for researchers
seriously interested in uncovering the behavior of an enzyme
they are clearly virtues.

Origins of the plots
All three of the straight-line plots were ﬁrst ascribed in print
to Woolf by Haldane and Stern, but he did not publish them
himself, because at the time he might have done so he was
recovering from a serious accident, as explained by Haldane
in a note to Nature in 1957. Equation 2.24 was ﬁrst published
by Hanes, but he did not present his results graphically. The
origins of the various plots are confused, and the names com-
monly associated with them do not provide a good guide. The
relevant publications are listed in Table 2.3.

The direct linear plot
The direct linear plot is a quite different way of plotting the
Michaelis–Menten equation, which may be rearranged, most
simply by taking equation 2.25 as a starting point, in yet
another way to show the dependence of V on Km:
V = v + v
a · Km
(2.26)
If V and Km are treated as variables, and a and v as constants,
this equation deﬁnes a straight line of slope v/a and intercepts
v on the V axis and −a on the Km axis. It may seem perverse
to treat V and Km as variables and a and v as constants, but in

error), all the lines intersect at a unique point whose coordinates yield the
values of Km and V that ﬁt the data. More realistically, as shown in Figure
2.21, experimental error causes this unique point to degenerate into a family
of points, each of which yields an estimate of Km and an estimate of V, and
the best estimates ˘Km and ˘V can be taken as the medians (middle values)
of the two series. See also the discussion of Figure 15.12 in Section 15.4.2

fact it is more logical than it appears: once a and v have been
measured in an experiment, they are constants, because any
honest analysis of the results will leave them unchanged, but
until we have decided on best-ﬁt values of V and Km we can
try any values we like, and in that sense they are variables.
For any pair of values a and v there is an inﬁnite set of
values of V and Km that satisfy them exactly. For any arbitrary
value of Km, equation 2.26 deﬁnes the corresponding value
of V. Consequently, the straight line drawn according to this
equation relates all pairs of Km and V values that satisfy one
observation exactly. If a second line is drawn for a second
observation (with different values of a and v), it will relate all
pairs of Km and V values that satisfy the second observation
exactly. However, the two lines will not deﬁne the same Km
and V values except at the point of intersection. This point
therefore deﬁnes the unique values of Km and V that satisfy
both observations exactly.

If there were no experimental error one could plot a series

v at a particular value of a, and they would all intersect at a
common point, which would specify the values of Km and V

that gave rise to the observations. This is illustrated in Figure
2.20. In reality, however, observations are never exact and so
all the lines cannot be expected to intersect at exactly the same
point, and a real plot is likely to resemble the one illustrated
in Figure 2.21.
Each intersection point provides one estimate of Km and
one of V, and in each series one can take the median (middle)
estimate as the best one: the vertical line showing the best Km
value is drawn to the left of half of the individual intersection
points and to the right of the other half; similarly, the horizon-
tal line showing the best V value is drawn above half of the
individual intersection points and below the other half.
Just as there are three ways of plotting the Michaelis–
Menten equation as a straight line, there are three variants of
the direct linear plot. The one shown in Figure 2.20 is the one
described originally, but the variant shown in Figure 2.22, in

which the intercepts are ai/vi and 1/vi rather than −ai and
vi may be preferable in practice because the lines intersect at
larger angles and the points of intersection are better deﬁned.
Moreover, as will be discussed in Section 15.4.5, it avoids the
need for any special rules to deal with intersection points
that occur outside the ﬁrst quadrant, that is to say points that
deﬁne negative values of one or other parameter.
The direct linear plot has a number of advantages over the
other graphical methods described in this section, of which
the most obvious is that in its original form (Figure 2.20) it
requires no calculation at all. This allows it to be used at the
laboratory bench while an experiment is proceeding, giving
an immediate visual idea of the likely parameter values and
of the design needed for deﬁning them precisely. In other
words one can obtain an immediate idea of the value of Km
from the ﬁrst two or three measurements and use it to choose
the appropriate substrate concentrations for the later ones.
More important, perhaps, the direct linear plot (in any of its
variants) has some desirable statistical properties that imply
that it leads to reliable parameter values: this point will be
taken up in Section 15.4. On the other hand, it is not a good
§15.4, pages 425–431
plot for showing a large amount of data on the same graph,
because it rapidly becomes overcrowded.
Like the plot of
v against v/a, it also tends to make any faults in the data
rather obvious. These characteristics make it more suitable
for use in the laboratory for the actual analysis of data than
for subsequent presentation of the results.

The reversible Michaelis–Menten
mechanism
2.7.1
The reversible rate equation
Many reactions of importance in biochemistry are reversible
in the practical sense that signiﬁcant amounts of both sub-
strates and products exist in the reaction mixture when it
has reached equilibrium.
It is evident, therefore, that the
Michaelis–Menten mechanism, as given, is incomplete, and
that allowance should be made for the reverse reaction:15

(2.27)
The steady-state assumption is now expressed by
dx
dt = k1(e0 −x)a + k−2(e0 −x)p −(k−1 + k2)x = 0
Gathering terms in x and rearranging, we obtain
x =
k1e0a + k−2e0p
k−1 + k2 + k1a + k−2p
Because this is a reversible system of reactions, the net rate of
release of P is obtained by subtracting the rate at which it is
consumed in the reaction E + P →EA from the rate at which
it is released in the reaction EA →E + P:
v = k2x −k−2(e0 −x)p
=
k2(k1e0a + k−2e0p)
k−1 + k2 + k1a + k−2p −k−2e0p + k−2(k1e0a + k−2e0p)p
k−1 + k2 + k1a + k−2p
Cross-multiplication to express everything over the same de-
nominator gives an apparently complicated numerator with
eight terms. However, six of these cancel, leaving
v =
k1k2e0a −k−1k−2e0p
k−1 + k2 + k1a + k−2p
(2.28)
The special case p = 0 gives the same equation as before,
equation 2.10, except that a should be replaced by a0, because
only at zero time is it legitimate to put p = 0. It is important
15Remember that the assumption that e0 is much smaller than a0 means
that we can write a0 as a, and similarly we can write p0 as p.
2.7 The reversible Michaelis–Menten mechanism

to realize that this simpliﬁcation is possible because p is zero,
not because of any assumption about the magnitude of k−2:
k−2p = 0 if p = 0, regardless of the value of k−2. The essential
distinction is between a rate and rate constant, and as it is
pervasive in kinetics it needs to be thoroughly understood: a
rate can be zero regardless of the size of any individual factor
in the rate expression if any of the other factors is zero.16
When a = 0 equation 2.28 simpliﬁes to a complementary
special case for the initial rate of the reverse reaction:
v =
−k−1k−2p
k−1 + k2 + k−2p
The negative sign in this equation is a consequence of deﬁning
the rate as the rate of release of P, dp/dt; if it had been de-
ﬁned as da/dt the rate would have turned out to be positive.
Apart from the sign, this equation is of the same form as
the Michaelis–Menten equation, and by comparing it with
equations 2.10–2.14 we can deﬁne parameters for the reverse
reaction:
kP
cat = k−1;
kP = k−1k−2

KmP = k−1 + k2

implies an assumption about the value of k−2 is a very common misconcep-
tion, fostered, unfortunately by some textbooks, such as that of Campbell
and Farrell. It is depressing to note that as recently as 2007 the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry made recommendations that assert
that k−2 is negligibly small. Astonishingly, the compilers of the recommen-
dations refused to acknowledge that this was an error when it was brought
to their attention. If experts on physical chemistry cannot understand that an
algebraic expression is zero if any one of its factors is zero, without implying
anything about the magnitudes of its other factors, what hope is there for
others?

equation 2.28 that it does not imply any particular mech-
anism and can be regarded as purely empirical: there are
many mechanisms more complicated than the one deﬁned
by equation 2.27 that lead to rate equations equivalent to
equation 2.29.
We shall need to consider more complicated mechanisms
immediately because equation 2.27 as it stands is illogical,
and the apparent symmetry in reading it from left to right
or vice versa is an illusion (Figure 2.24). The problem is that
although k2 and k−1 look as if they are analogous to one
another they are not, because k−1 is usually understood as
the rate constant for a simple substrate-release step, whereas
k2 is understood to include not only product release but also
the chemical transformation of enzyme-bound substrate into
enzyme-bound product.
This might not matter much if it
were not that a major objective of mechanistic investigations
of enzymes is often to understand, in as much detail as pos-
sible, the chemical processes that allow an enzyme to effect
a chemical transformation, and one cannot understand this if
one fails to separate processes that are conceptually distinct.
We now therefore consider the more realistic three-step
mechanism—in which the conversion of A into P in the cat-
alytic site of the enzyme is represented as a process separate
from release of P from the enzyme:

derivations made earlier.
As I shall be describing a more

for the reverse reaction. In spite of their complicated appear-
ance, the expressions for KmA and KmP simplify to the true
substrate dissociation constants KsA and KsP of EA and EP
respectively if the second step in the appropriate direction is
rate-limiting. Thus,
KmA = k−1

k2 ≪(k−2 + k3)
(2.37)

if
k−2 ≪(k−1 + k2)

Both simpliﬁcations apply simultaneously if both conditions
are satisﬁed, that is to say if the interconversion of EA and EP
is rate-limiting in both directions.
The question for which equations 2.37–2.38 give the an-
swer is not often asked the other way round, but doing
so helps to understand the points raised at the end of Sec-
tion 2.3.1: are there any conditions in which the two Michaelis
constants are both very different from the corresponding
equilibrium constants? Atkinson is one of the few to have
D. E. Atkinson (1977) Cellular
Energy Metabolism and its
Regulation, pages 275–282,
Academic Press, New York
asked this question, and the answer is surprising. Clearly,
from equations 2.37–2.38, we require k2 to be large compared
58
2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
with k−2 + k3 and k−2 to be simultaneously large compared
with k−1 + k2. As this is impossible, it follows that at in least
one direction of reaction (and often in both) the Michaelis con-
stant will be close to the corresponding dissociation constant.
This analysis is shown schematically in Figure 2.25.
Atkinson concludes that “we need not hesitate to infer
probable afﬁnities of enzymes for substrates from kinetic
Michaelis constants”. This, however, takes the argument too
far, because there are many reactions in biochemistry that
proceed in only one direction under all physiological con-
ditions, and in which the equilibrium constant favors this
physiological direction of reaction.
For these reactions we
are more likely to be interested in the Michaelis constant for
the forward direction, and it is this Michaelis constant that
is more likely to differ from the corresponding dissociation
constant, because forward rate constants must on average
be larger than the comparable reverse rate constants for any
reaction with an equilibrium constant that favors the forward
direction.
It is also possible for both Michaelis constants to be equi-
librium constants without either binding step being at equilib-
rium: if k−1 = k3 (if A and P are released from their respective
complexes with the same rate constant), then both expres-
sions have common factors of (k−2 + k2 + k3) in numerator
and denominator, which cancel.
As I have described else-
where, both of the simpliﬁcations given in equations 2.37–2.38
then apply without any assumptions about the magnitudes of
k−2 or k2.

Despite these various examples in which Km is equivalent
to a substrate dissociation constant, in general it is not safe to
assume this unless there is deﬁnite evidence for it. Km is best
taken as an empirical quantity that describes the dependence
of v on a, not as a measure of the thermodynamic stability of
the enzyme–substrate complex.

and so if a∞and p∞are the equilibrium values of a and p it

dane relationship, and is true for any mechanism described by
equation 2.29, not merely for the simple two-step Michaelis–
Menten mechanism. More complicated rate equations, such
as those that describe reactions of several substrates, lead
to more complicated Haldane relationships, as discussed in
Section 8.3.4, but for all equations there is at least one rela-
tionship of this kind between the kinetic parameters and the
equilibrium constant.
J
OHN BURDON SANDERSON
HALDANE (1892–1964) was
one of the great biologists
of the 20th Century, and his
work on enzymes, important
though it was, formed just a
small part of a career that in-
cluded major contributions to
physiology, genetics, mathe-
matical statistics, theories of the
origin of life, popular science
and politics. (In these last
capacities he wrote articles for
the Daily Worker, a communist
newspaper, and for a while was
chairman of its board of
management.) He became a
citizen of India, and spent the
last years of his life there. His
book Enzymes, published in
1930, remains challenging and
interesting 80 years later. In the
preface to the paperback edition
of 1964 he remarked that
Frederick Hopkins had con-
vinced him that enzymes were
the central topic of biochemis-
try, and that his father, the
physiologist J. S. Haldane, had
shown in about 1910 that
despite the large size of the
hemoglobin molecule its
properties could be understood
in terms of the laws that hold
for small molecules: two
insights that have lost none of
their importance in the era of
genomic research. He retained
his interest in enzymes to the
end of his life, this preface
being written only a few
months before he died from
cancer. He was almost unique
in having enjoyed his service in
the front lines during the First
World War. The verse that he
wrote about his colostomy,
which begins “I wish I had the
voice of Homer, to sing of rectal
carcinoma...”, indicates an
ability to remain cheerful in
almost any circumstances.
2.7.3
“One-way enzymes”
Some enzymes are much more effective catalysts for one di-
rection of reaction than the other.
As a striking example,
Mudd and Mann found that the limiting rate of the for-
ward reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase
is about 2 × 105 greater than that for the reverse reaction,
even though the equilibrium constant is close to unity. Even
after Jencks analyzed this type of behavior in depth, many
biochemists remain rather uneasy about it, suspecting that it
may violate the laws of thermodynamics. However, although
these laws, in the form of the Haldane relationship, do indeed
place limits on the kinetic behavior that an enzyme can dis-
play, they still allow a wide range of behavior.
§8.3.4, pages 202–203
The thermodynamic condition deﬁned by equation 2.40
shows that the ratio of the speciﬁcity constants kA/kP is equal
to the equilibrium constant Keq. The speciﬁcity constants fully
deﬁne the rates in the limit of low substrate concentrations,
and so under these conditions increasing a catalyst concentra-
tion must increase the rates equally in the forward and reverse
directions, since otherwise the equilibrium constant would be
changed.
At higher concentrations, however, the enzyme can inﬂu-
ence the rates differently in the two directions. The simplest
case to consider concerns the rates at the limit of high sub-
strate concentrations. They now depend not on kA and kP
but on kA
cat and kP
cat, which may be written as kAKmA and
kPKmP.
It follows that if KmA is very different from KmP,
the effectiveness of the catalysis in one direction may be very
different from that in the other. Suppose, for example, that
the equilibrium constant is unity, and that KmA is 105 times
greater than KmP.
The catalytic constant kA
cat = kAKmA is
then 105 times larger than kP
cat = kPKmP, and in the limit
60
2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
of high substrate concentrations the enzyme affects the rate
in the forward direction much more than that in the reverse
direction.
To examine the range of behavior possible, we can ignore
the ratio of speciﬁcity constants, because this is set by ther-
modynamics, and we can also ignore the actual magnitudes
of these constants because these just reﬂect the general level
of catalytic activity of the enzyme.
So, returning to equa-
tion 2.29, and setting kAe0 = 1, kPe0 = 1 and a + p = 1 (all in
arbitrary units), it can be written as follows:

This equation17 now violates the principles of dimensional
analysis (Section 1.3), so it cannot be the expression of a
general kinetic property, but it is acceptable as long as its use
is limited to numerical calculations of the effects of particular
parameters on the kinetic behavior.
Equation 2.41 shows that in the conditions considered the
rate of approach to equilibrium is the determined by the
values of p/a and the Michaelis constants. As seen in Figure
2.26, if KmA and KmP are very different in magnitude a plot
of v against ln(p/a) drawn at high reactant concentrations is
highly unsymmetrical: if KmP ≪KmA (if product binds much
more tightly than substrate, as happens, for example, with
numerous dehydrogenases that convert the oxidized form
of NAD into the reduced form) the curve is much steeper
when equilibrium is approached in the forward direction than
when it is approached in the reverse direction; in the opposite
conditions it is the reverse.
An enzyme may therefore be

much better at catalyzing one direction of the reaction than
the other, without violating any thermodynamic constraints.
Study of Figure 2.26 conﬁrms that the rate at equilibrium is
zero, and that in any other state the reaction is always towards
equilibrium: these are all that thermodynamics requires; there
is no requirement that the curves should be symmetrical
about the equilibrium point or that equilibrium should be
approached just as steeply from either direction.
The possibility of a “one-way enzyme” makes physiolog-
ical sense, because many enzymes never need to catalyze a

reaction in the reverse direction in vivo, and so there is no
reason why efﬁcient catalysis of the reverse reaction should
have evolved. The absence of a disadvantage is not the same
as an advantage, however, and one may still ask why such
behavior should have been selected. The answer probably
lies in the limited amount of binding energy available for
designing the enzyme, as discussed by Jencks. If the active
site is made strictly complementary to the transition state of
the uncatalyzed reaction that converts A into P, the enzyme
will be optimized as a catalyst for both directions. However,
if only one of the directions has any physiological importance
the efﬁciency in this direction can be improved at the expense
of the other by evolving an active site that binds one or other
reactant better than it binds the transition state.

the energy level of E + P is

it can be made to proceed
from left to right by efﬁcient
removal of product, indicated
here as E + (0). However, the
kinetics depend primarily on
the height of the energy level
of the highest peak, labeled
as EA‡ above the level of the
substrate, E + A, and this is not
affected by product removal.
By optimizing the binding of
enzyme to the transition state
A‡ catalysis can be improved.
However, as the enzyme can
only be optimized for one
intermediate or transition state,
the other peaks must rise, but
this has very little importance
as long as they do not rise
above the level of EA‡.
These points may be clariﬁed by reference to Figure 2.27,
which shows a reaction that is catalytically unfavorable, be-
cause in the standard state with substrate and product con-
centrations equal the reaction must proceed from right to
left. This is the case, for example, for aspartate kinase, which
catalyzes the reaction
aspartate + ATP →aspartyl phosphate + ADP
This reaction is the ﬁrst step in a major pathway in amino acid
metabolism, and the physiological need is for the reaction
to proceed in the direction of the arrow.
However, that is
not the direction favored by the equilibrium constant.18 The
thermodynamic problem is solved by efﬁcient removal of
the product aspartyl phosphate, maintaining its concentration
close to zero, but that cannot improve the kinetics, which is
determined by the height of the highest peak in the energy
proﬁle and not by the thermodynamics. As drawn, there are
two intermediates and three transition states in the diagram,
and, as they are not all the same, the enzyme cannot optimize
the binding of all of them: improving the binding of one will
make it worse for the others. However, as long as the highest
peak is brought lower it matters very little if the others are
raised.
2.8
Product inhibition
Product inhibition is simply a special case of inhibition, which
will be discussed in detail in Chapters 6 and 7, but because it

18This is shown wrongly, or at best misleadingly, in most textbooks.

2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
follows naturally from the previous section it is convenient to
mention it brieﬂy here. When equation 2.29 applies, the rate
must decrease as product accumulates, even if the decrease
in substrate concentration is negligible, because the negative
term in the numerator becomes increasingly important as
equilibrium is approached, and because the third term in the
denominator increases with p. In any reaction, the negative
term in the numerator can only have a noticeable effect if
the reaction is signiﬁcantly reversible.
However, product
inhibition is observable in many reactions that are essentially
irreversible, such as the classic example of the invertase-
catalyzed hydrolysis of sucrose. Such inhibition indicates that
the product must be capable of binding to the enzyme, and
is compatible with the simplest two-step mechanism only if
the ﬁrst step is irreversible and the second is not. Irreversible
binding of substrate followed by reverse product release does
not seem likely, at least as a general phenomenon. On the
other hand, the three-step mechanism predicts that product
inhibition can occur in an irreversible reaction if it is the
second step, the chemical transformation, that is irreversible.
When this is true the accumulation of product causes the
enzyme to be sequestered as the EP complex, and hence un-
available for reacting with the substrate. For an irreversible
reaction equation 2.29 then becomes
v =
kAe0a
1 +
a
KmA
+
p
KmP
=
kcate0a
KmA(1 + p/KsP) + a
(2.42)
If the reaction is irreversible KmP can legitimately be written
as an equilibrium constant, KsP, because if k−2 approximates
to zero it must be small compared with (k−1 + k2). As will be
seen in Section 6.2.1, equation 2.42 has exactly the form of the
§6.2.1, pages 134–136
commonest type of inhibition, known as competitive inhibition.
The effect of added product should be the same as that of
accumulated product, so one could measure initial rates with
different concentrations of added product. For each product
concentration, the initial rate for different substrate concentra-
tions would obey the Michaelis–Menten equation, but with
apparent values19 of kcat and KmA, given by kapp
cat
= kcat
and Kapp
mA = KmA(1 + p/KsP), as may be seen by comparing
19The concept of an apparent value, designated in this book by a superscript
app, is very common in enzyme kinetics: it means the value of a parameter
obtained by treating as constant some concentration, typically that of an
inhibitor or additional substrate, that is actually a variable.

the same value kcat as for the uninhibited reaction, but Kapp

larger than KmA and increases linearly with p.

equivalent to equation 2.42.

itive inhibition, but with others, such as glucose with the
same enzyme, the behavior was more complicated.
There
are anyway many substances apart from products that inhibit
enzymes, and a more complete theory is needed: this will be
developed in later chapters (especially Chapter 6).

Integration of enzyme rate equations
2.9.1
Michaelis–Menten equation without product
inhibition
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the earliest
students of enzyme kinetics encountered many difﬁculties
because they followed reactions over extended periods of
time, and then tried to explain their observations in terms of
integrated rate equations similar to those commonly used in
chemical kinetics. Michaelis and Menten then showed that

Boyde (1980)
the behavior of enzymes could be studied much more simply
by measuring initial rates20, when the complicating effects of
product accumulation and substrate depletion did not apply.
An unfortunate by-product of this early history, however, has
been that biochemists have been reluctant to use integrated
rate equations even when they have been appropriate. It is
not always possible to do steady-state experiments in such a
way that the progress curve (the plot of p against t) is essen-
tially straight during an extended period, and estimation of
the initial slope of a curve, and hence the initial rate, is subjec-
tive and liable to be biased. Much of this subjectivity can be
removed by using an integrated form of the rate equation, as
I shall now describe.
The Michaelis–Menten equation can be written as an equa-
tion in terms of three variables, p, t and a, as follows (compare
20This is one of the two major innovations introduced by Michaelis and
Menten, revolutionizing the way enzyme kinetics is studied. The other is the
realization of the need for proper control of pH.

(2.43)
As such it cannot be integrated directly, but one of the three
variables can be removed by means of the stoichiometric rela-
tionship a + p = a0, which is accurate enough21 in the usual
conditions with a0 much larger than the enzyme concentra-
tion. Then we have
dp

of course, the same slope and intercept as given by the plot
of a/v against a for initial rates (Figure 2.16), and analogous
plots corresponding to those in Figures 2.14 and 2.17 are also
possible.
However, this implication should be taken with precau-
tion, because, as explained in Section 2.9.2, there are some
§2.9.2, pages 65–66
unstated assumptions in the derivation of equation 2.45 that
mean that these are not reliable ways of estimating the param-
eters of the Michaelis–Menten equation.
2.9.2
Effect of product inhibition on progress curves
Although equation 2.45 is a valid integrated form of equa-
tion 2.43, it is highly misleading to regard it as the integrated
form of the Michaelis–Menten equation, and it can lead to
gross errors in the parameter estimates if it is used without
taking account of violation of the initial-rate conditions that
are fundamental to the Michaelis–Menten approach.

essential problem is that although product inhibition can usu-
ally be ignored in initial-rate studies, it can rarely be ignored
in studies of time courses,22 because whatever the product
concentration at the beginning it will accumulate to positive
values as the reaction proceeds.
In the simplest case we
need to replace equation 2.44 by an equation that allows for
competitive inhibition by P with inhibition constant Kp:

which has the same algebraic form as equation 2.44.
This
equivalence has two important consequences: ﬁrst, we can-
not tell from experimental time-course data that satisfy equa-
tion 2.45 whether equation 2.44 is the correct starting point, as
opposed to equation 2.46; second, the same logic that allowed
integration of equation 2.44 can be applied with only minor
22The main exceptions occur when the product released from the enzyme
is transformed rapidly and completely into a different substance by a non-
enzymic reaction. For example, an enzyme like aldehyde dehydrogenase
releases its product as the free carboxylic acid, which would certainly inhibit
the enzyme if it accumulated. In practice, however, it does not accumulate
because it is instantly deprotonated to the corresponding anion. If the anion
acted as a signiﬁcant inhibitor of the enzyme it would be a matter of deﬁnition
whether to call this product inhibition, but for the purposes of this section it
would have the same effects as product inhibition. See Figure 2.29.

product to the enzyme is truly negligible, and they will be
negative if it binds more tightly than the substrate (if Kp is less
than Km). To appreciate what is meant by “truly negligible”
in this context, suppose that we want to analyze time courses
with a0 = 2Km and we need to be within 5% of the true Km.
Km must be at most 0.03Kp, so the substrate needs to bind at
least 33 times more tightly to the enzyme than the product.
This is not impossible, but it is sufﬁciently unlikely to make
it dangerous to use equation 2.45 directly for estimating the
Michaelis–Menten parameters if no precautions are taken.

measurements” Journal of

However, the potential advantages of equation 2.45 can be
liberated from the complications due to product inhibition by
ensuring that the product is removed as fast as it is generated,
maintaining its concentration small enough to be negligible.
As Tang and Leyh have described, this can be achieved by
adding a sufﬁcient quantity of an enzyme that catalyzes the
removal of the product.23
Moreover, once the Michaelis–
§4.1.4, pages 89–93
Menten parameters have been established in these conditions
the product inhibition can be characterized by repeating the
procedure without removing the product.

Other problems with time courses
The preceding section considered the effect of competitive
product inhibition on the use of equation 2.45 to obtain es-

timates of the Michaelis–Menten parameters. However, com-
petitive product inhibition is just the simplest complication to
discuss; it is not the only one. More generally, equation 2.45
is valid only if the decrease in substrate concentration is the
only reason for the rate to decrease during the course of the
reaction. Apart from competitive product inhibition, other
sorts of product inhibition, drift in the pH or temperature, or
loss of enzyme activity during the assay, can all cause equa-
tion 2.45 to be invalid. In principle some of these effects can be
detected by failure of the time course to follow the equation,
even when written with apparent parameters (equation 2.47),
but only in principle: effects that are too small to be readily
observable can produce gross errors in estimated values of V
and Km.
2.9.4
Characterizing mutant enzymes
Greatly improved experimental techniques now allow mutant
enzymes to be produced rapidly at will, and to be charac-
terized almost automatically. This revolution has, however,
brought new problems that are easy to overlook. Although
natural enzymes have evolved to high catalytic activity and
speciﬁcity, these are not the only properties properties to have
been subject to natural selection. Many have also evolved to
fulﬁll the sort of regulatory functions discussed in Chapter 12,
Chapter 12, pages 281–325
and all are sufﬁciently stable in vivo to fulﬁll their catalytic
functions. However, there is no reason to expect a mutant
enzyme selected for high catalytic activity or other property
of interest to the experimenter to be just as stable during the
kinetic assay as its natural counterpart; there is likewise no
reason to assume that storage conditions that have proved
to be effective for a natural enzyme, or certain of its mutant
forms, to be equally effective for all of the mutant forms. Tests
of inactivation during a reaction, as described in Section 4.2,
§4.2, pages 93–95
have become more important in recent decades, not less. In
addition, more care needs to be taken in determining initial
rates of reaction, not less.
2.9.5
Accurate estimation of initial rates
Despite the complications discussed in Sections 2.9.2–2.9.3,
§§2.9.2–2.9.3, pages 65–67
measurements of Vapp and Kapp
m
can be useful if we recognize
them for their true worth, not as direct measures of V and
Km but as vehicles for calculating highly accurate values of
the initial rate v0 when they are inserted into the following

v0 =
Vappa0

(2.49)
This equation follows from equation 2.47 by differentiation,
regardless of the meanings of Vapp and Kapp
m .
Rearranging equation 2.49, we have

which shows that a plot of t/ ln[a0/(a0 −p)] against p/
ln[a0/(a0 −p)] gives a straight line of slope 1/Vapp and inter-
cept Kapp
m /Vapp on the ordinate. Vapp and Kapp
m
can readily be
determined from such a plot, and v0 can be calculated from
them with equation 2.49.
However, v0 may also be found
directly without evaluating Vapp and Kapp
m
by a simple extrap-
olation of the line: rearrangement of equation 2.49 into the
form of equation 2.24 shows that the point (a0, a0/v0) ought to
lie on a straight line of slope 1/Vapp and intercept Kapp
m /Vapp
on the ordinate, the same straight line as that plotted from
equation 2.49. This means that if that line is extrapolated back
to a point at which p/ ln[a0/(a0 −p)] = a0, the value of the
ordinate must be a0/v0. The whole procedure is illustrated
in Figure 2.30. The extrapolated point can then be treated
as a point on an ordinary plot of a0/v0 against a0 (compare
Figure 2.16), and if several such points are found from several
progress curves with different values of a0, Km and V may be
found as described previously (Section 2.6.3).
This procedure, which originated with Jennings and Nie-
mann, may seem an unnecessarily laborious way of generat-
ing an ordinary plot of a0/v0 against a0, but it provides more
accurate values of a0/v0 than are available by more ordinary
methods, and hence more accurate parameter values.
The
necessary extrapolation is short, and it can be done more
precisely and less subjectively than estimating the tangent
of a curve extrapolated back to zero time. A study of sub-
tilisin variants in which this approach was found to give
satisfactory results is described by Brode and co-workers.
A simpler method, illustrated in Figure 2.31 and involving
only trivial calculations (no logarithms) may be obtained
by taking advantage of the fact that the logarithmic term
p/ ln[a0/(a0 −p)] is almost exactly equal to −a0 + p/2 over a
sufﬁciently wide range24, and applying the logic of the direct

2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
it follows that a plot of p/t against p should give a straight
line with an intercept on the ordinate of ka0, the initial rate
of reaction. Boeker showed that the intercept still gives the
initial rate in the more general case of ﬁrst-order kinetics, with
nonzero p at t = 0, for example, or less than 100% conversion
at completion, as long as it is the increase in p that is plotted,
in other words the ordinate variable needs to be (p −p0)/t
rather than p/t.
More important for enzyme kinetics, she
also realized that although the theory does not apply quite as
simply to enzyme reactions, there is no practical difference,
because the departure from expectation is normally too small
to detect.

Because of the third term on the right-hand side this no longer
exactly deﬁnes a straight line, but there are two important
points to consider. First, this third term is zero at the start of
the reaction, so it has no effect on the ordinate intercept, which
is still the initial rate. Second, it is in general small enough to
produce only trivial deviations from linearity in the early part
of the reaction, and consequently has only trivial effects on the
use of a plot of p/t against p for estimating the initial rate.
A time course published by Schønheyder provides a con-
venient example for testing this (or any other) method of
estimating initial rates, because it consists of 25 observations
covering the reaction from 2.5% to 98.5% completion. The
conventional time course is illustrated in Figure 2.32, and
the corresponding Boeker plot is illustrated in Figure 2.34.
Notice that whereas the conventional plot is curved over the
whole period, the Boeker plot is essentially straight for the
ﬁrst 15 minutes, up to about 40% of reaction. Notice also that,
although systematic errors in the approximation tend to zero
at zero time, the reverse is true of random errors, because, in
the limit at zero time the value of p/t is 0/0, which means
that it is undeﬁned.
The practical consequence is that the
line should be drawn by eye, paying little attention to the
scattered points at low t. Applying a naive linear regression to
obtain the “best” line one is likely to produce a line that is far
from being the best because it will be excessively inﬂuenced
by the least precise points.

Time courses for other mechanisms
In the initial development of methods for integrating rate
equations and analyzing time courses each mechanism tended
to be treated in isolation; although numerous examples were
analyzed, including reactions subject to competitive product
inhibition, reversible reactions and some reactions with more
than one substrate, as listed in Table 2.4, these did not ﬁt in
any obvious way into a general framework. Later, however,

Boeker developed a systematic approach that allows many
of the mechanisms important in the study of enzymes to be
handled in the same way. By this time, however, less efﬁcient
initial-rate methods of analyzing the same mechanisms had
become so widespread that her work has had less impact
than it merited. An example of an application may be found,
however, in a study by Schiller and co-workers of variants
of aspartate transaminase. In recent years the main work on
the analysis of time courses of enzyme-catalyzed reactions has
been that of Duggleby and co-workers, whose papers should
be consulted for more information.
The article of Goudar
and co-workers is of particular interest as it describes how
to express the progress of a reaction as a function of time:
it is more usual (but much less convenient for curve-ﬁtting
purposes) to express time as a function of the progress, as in
equation 2.45.

2. Introduction to enzyme kinetics
Summary of Chapter 2
• The enzyme–substrate complex is a feature of all modern
§2.1, pages 25–27
ideas of enzyme mechanisms.
• The enzyme–substrate complex is sometimes said to exist in
§§2.2–2.3, pages 28–38
equilibrium with the free enzyme and substrate molecules, but
it is more accurate to say that there is a steady state in which
the rate of formation is balanced by the rate of breakdown to
products. Both assumptions lead to a kinetic equation of the
same form, the Michaelis–Menten equation.
• The Michaelis–Menten equation deﬁnes a function in which
§2.3.4, pages 35–37
the rate is proportional to the substrate concentration at very
low concentrations, but ﬂattens out as the system approaches
saturation, approaching a value known as the limiting rate
and symbolized as V. When the molarity e0 of the enzyme
is known it is convenient to deﬁne a quantity kcat = V/e0
as the catalytic constant. The substrate concentration at
which the rate is 0.5V is called the Michaelis constant and
symbolized as Km.
• The ratio kcat/Km deﬁnes the capacity of an enzyme to distin-
§2.4, pages 38–43
guish between two competing substrates in a mixture and is
called the speciﬁcity constant.
• There are many ways of plotting the Michaelis–Menten equa-
§2.6, pages 45–53
tion, which have different advantages and disadvantages in
different circumstances. Although they are nowadays largely
supplanted by computer-based methods for quantitative anal-
ysis they remain important for presentation of results.
• The Michaelis–Menten equation can be generalized to take
§2.7, pages 54–61
account of reversible reactions. There are limiting rates and
Michaelis constants for both directions, but the four parame-
ters are not fully independent because the equation must yield
a zero rate for a reaction at equilibrium. This is known as the
Haldane relationship.
• Integration of the Michaelis–Menten equation allows the
§2.9, pages 63–71
extent of a reaction to be expressed as a function of time. This
approach is potentially informative, but it needs to be used
with great caution.
• The study of mutant enzymes engineered to have new prop-
§2.9.4, page 67
erties requires extra care, because one cannot assume that
such enzymes will be as stable as their natural counterparts.

is inversely related to the size of its substrate, giving
as examples catalase (1 MDa), which acts on H2O2 (34
Da), and proteinases such as pepsin (35 kDa) that act on
proteins larger than they are. As a generalization this is,
of course, an exaggeration, but it contains a measure of
truth. How might it be explained?
Chapter 3
“Alternative” enzymes
3.1
Introduction
The kinetic analysis of a catalyzed reaction is not crucially
dependent on the chemical structure of the catalyst; enzyme
kinetics can be discussed without any reference to chemical
structures. Indeed, the basis of the subject was established
before much was known about the chemical nature of en-
zymes. If natural enzymes were based on the structure of
RNA rather than on proteins, the main thing that would
need to be changed in discussing enzyme kinetics would be
the treatment of ionizing groups (Section 10.2).
Increasing
§10.2, pages 255–257
interest in recent years in various kinds of “alternative en-
zymes” has therefore scarcely affected the relevance of the
classical material, as all of the classical methods apply as well
to these as to the classical kinds of enzymes, and the kinetic
analysis that occupies most of this book is just as necessary for
studying these other catalysts as it is for classical enzymes.
Nonetheless, it is useful to pause brieﬂy to consider other
sorts of macromolecular catalysts that are currently studied.
Nearly all known enzymes, and probably all of those
involved in central metabolism, are naturally occurring pro-
teins. Many contain nonprotein cofactors such as ﬂavins and
metal ions that are essential for the catalytic functions, but
this is not a universal feature: the extracellular peptidases,
for example, consist just of protein, and even many of the
enzymes involved in central metabolism are kinases or NAD-

or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases, for which the so-called
coenzymes are actually just substrates.
Among the nonclassical enzymes, catalytic RNA has the
same claim to our attention as classical protein enzymes: it is
a natural component of living systems, and understanding its
behavior is a part of understanding life. Moreover, although
far fewer RNA enzymes than protein enzymes are known,
they have a particular importance for studies of evolution
and the origin of life, because it is widely believed that they
evolved earlier than protein enzymes (see for example Szath-
máry and Maynard-Smith). Interest in the other alternative

Smith (1993) “The evolution of

enzymes is primarily technological, as it is hoped that they
can provide catalysts more suitable than natural enzymes for
industrial purposes, offering either greater stability or speci-
ﬁcity for reactions that do not occur in living organisms.
It is natural for people interested in these molecules to
attribute to them an importance that is based more on an
optimistic assessment of their potential than on anything that
has actually been achieved. One of the ways that this is done
is to use special names that obscure rather than illuminate
their nature, such as synzyme (= synthetic enzyme) for artiﬁ-
cial enzyme, ribozyme (= ribonucleic acid enzyme) for catalytic
RNA, and abzyme (= antibody enzyme) for catalytic antibody.
More serious is a tendency to present results in a misleading
way, suggesting that they are much better catalysts than they
are in reality: although this tendency has decreased, exag-
gerated claims are still being made for catalytic antibodies.
One should be particularly cautious of results obtained with
substrates chosen to illustrate speciﬁc claims rather than for
the industrial importance of the reactions they can undergo.

Artiﬁcial enzymes
The ﬁrst “artiﬁcial enzyme” was made from the bacterial
proteinase subtilisin, independently by Polgar and Bender,
and by Neet and Koshland, in both cases chemical methods
being used to alter the active-site serine residue into a cysteine
residue. As the resulting molecule was a protein, albeit an
unnatural one, we probably would not nowadays call it an
artiﬁcial enzyme, especially as unnatural proteins are now
produced daily by genetic manipulation rather than by chem-
ical modiﬁcation. Nonetheless, it is interesting to compare the
reactions of the two groups who independently prepared it,
as they shed light on modern attitudes to artiﬁcial enzymes.
3.2 Artiﬁcial enzymes

Polgar and Bender were impressed that thiol-subtilisin could
catalyze a reaction at all, and called their molecule a “new en-
zyme containing a synthetically formed active site”. Neet and
Koshland, noting that thiol groups are in general much more
reactive than alcohol groups and that the change implied an
extremely small conformational change, called it “a chemical
mutation”. They considered that the important question to
ask was why it was so much worse a catalyst than one might
have hoped, and the answer is the same today when one is
faced with similarly unimpressive results: it is because we
still lack a complete understanding of why natural enzymes
are so effective as catalysts.
Artiﬁcial enzymes can also be macromolecules produced
by chemical methods that do not necessarily use any of the
structural features found in real enzymes. As the long-term
objective is to produce catalysts for industrial use that com-
bine high stability (for example at high temperature or ex-
treme pH) with the high catalytic effectiveness and speciﬁcity
of enzymes, the backbone structures are often derived from
polymers that are more stable and resistant to extreme con-
ditions than proteins, such as cyclic peptides, poly(ethylene
imine), and cyclodextrins (cyclic polymers of glucose). Poly-
merization of ethylene imine produces a highly branched
molecule containing primary secondary and tertiary amine
groups, which confer high solubility in water and which can
readily be modiﬁed by alkylation or acylation to produce a
variety of microenvironments and functionalities. Another
objective is to produce catalysts for industrially useful re-
actions for which natural catalysts are not available, again
the hope is that this can be achieved by grafting appropriate
chemical groups to backbones of well-deﬁned structure.
An early success claimed for this kind of polymer was the
production of a catalyst for the hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-5-
nitrophenyl sulfate, about 100 times more efﬁcient than the
same reaction catalyzed by the enzyme type IIA aryl sulfatase,
as found by Kiefer and co-workers. Nonetheless, this is not a

particularly useful reaction to be able to catalyze; the value
of kcat/Km = 1.1 M−1 · s−1 is many orders of magnitude
smaller than the values observed with many enzymes with
natural substrates, which can be as high as 3 × 108 M−1 · s−1
(see Fersht’s book); and the comparison with type IIA aryl
sulfatase is irrelevant, because 2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl sul-
fate is not its natural substrate, so it did not evolve to catalyze
this reaction and there is no reason to regard it as optimized
for it.

Despite the disappointing nature of this ﬁrst result, Pike
could write ﬁfteen years later that “no other synthetic poly-
mer has been shown to provide a larger rate enhancement
accompanied by substrate turnover”. More than twenty years
later still, results with completely synthetic artiﬁcial enzymes
continue to be unimpressive, but modifying existing protein

Site-directed mutagenesis
Site-directed mutagenesis is a technique for changing the amino
acid residue at a speciﬁc location in an enzyme molecule. This
is often done as part of an investigation of the mechanism of
catalysis of a known enzyme, but it can also be done as a way
of producing a new catalyst, or at least a catalyst that is greatly
modiﬁed. For example, Ma and Penning modiﬁed the steroid
binding site of 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase so that it
became a 20a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; in other words
they changed the sex hormone speciﬁcity from androgen to
progestin, with a change in speciﬁcity constant for the desired
reaction by a factor of 2 × 1011. In another example, Ménez
and co-workers modiﬁed cyclophilin, an enzyme that nor-

mally catalyzes cis–trans isomerization of aminoacylproline
bonds in proteins, so that it would catalyze hydrolysis of such
bonds; they did this by introducing mutations that would
make the active site similar to that of well studied proteinases
like chymotrypsin, and achieved an increase of about 104-fold
in the desired reaction.
A more recent example is provided by the enzyme ketol-
acid reductoisomerase, which catalyzes the oxidation of di-
hydroxyisovalerate. The natural enzyme is highly speciﬁc for
oxidized NADP as electron donor, by a factor of about 300,
but Bastian and co-workers obtained a mutant with reversed
speciﬁcity, the new enzyme being more speciﬁc for NAD by a
factor of about 200.
Each of these enzymes had natural catalytic activity, so
the effect was to alter the speciﬁcity of an existing enzyme.
Attempts to convert a protein with no native catalytic ac-
tion into a useful enzyme have not yet been correspondingly
successful. For example, Nixon and co-workers attempted
to create a scytalone dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in
3.4 Chemical mimics of enzyme catalysis
81
melanin synthesis in fungi, by introducing catalytic groups
into a noncatalytic protein involved in protein translocation.
Although they were successful in producing a substantial
activity in a previously inactive protein, this still fell far short,
by a factor of around 105, of the activity of a natural scytalone
dehydrogenase.
Natural enzymes are, of course, the products of evolution,
and not only catalytic activity and speciﬁcity have been se-
lected, but also other properties such as sensitivity to effec-
tors, and, especially, stability. None of this applies to a mutant
enzyme, which may be much less stable in assay conditions
than the natural enzyme from which was derived, and tests
such that to be described in Section 4.2 become important.

age the production and consumption of H2 as a fuel to re-
place traditional fuels such as hydrocarbons that release large
amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.
A fuel cell for gen-
erating electrical power from oxidation of H2, for example,
requires catalysts for two processes, for splitting the molecule
into protons and electrons in one compartment, and for gen-
erating a voltage by oxidation of the protons in another. In
principle both of these functions can be satisﬁed by enzymes:
bacterial hydrogenases can catalyze the ﬁrst, and laccases are
widely distributed enzymes that catalyze the second. How-
ever, hydrogenases in particular are typically very sensitive to
O2 and difﬁcult to maintain in a viable state under industrial
conditions. Both processes can also be efﬁciently catalyzed
by platinum, but this is open to an even greater objection,
that it is among the least abundant of all elements, and far
too expensive to use on an industrial scale.
The question
therefore arises of whether one could mimic the chemistry of
hydrogenases with organic structures built around far more
abundant metal ions, such as cobalt or nickel, as illustrated in
Figure 3.36. Fontecave and co-workers have reported promis-
ing results in this direction.
3.5
Catalytic RNA
As is well known, DNA has a highly regular double-helical
structure. The regularity is essential to its function as a store
of information, but at the same time it means that DNA
82
3. “Alternative” enzymes
could never fulﬁll the catalytic functions of protein-enzymes,
because it cannot be folded into complicated shapes,1 placing
catalytic groups almost at will, and in any case DNA has a
far more limited range of chemical groups than those found
in proteins. To some degree, however, tRNA (and in a much
more complicated way the ribosome) overcomes both of these
difﬁculties. As illustrated in Figure 3.37, it contains various
modiﬁed bases such as dihydrouridine not found in mRNA,
and although the molecule contains double-helical regions it
also contains hairpins and other structural elements that al-
low it to adopt more complicated structures than that of DNA.
In principle, therefore, we might expect that RNA could fulﬁll
at least some functions as a biological catalyst.

thermophila catalyzes a speciﬁc reaction in the processing of
RNA and that it has all of the properties of an enzyme. As
they noted, its efﬁciency as a catalyst, with a kcat/Km value of
about 103 M1  s1, is low by the standards of many protein
enzymes (such as those tabulated by Fersht), but within the
range found with other enzymes that recognize speciﬁc nu-
cleic acid sequences. High speciﬁcity is much more important
than high activity for the biological role of such enzymes,
even more than for the enzymes discussed in Section 2.4.1.
This ﬁeld has developed substantially since the original
discovery, and Doudna and Lorsch describe how catalytic
RNA molecules are now known to use a wide variety of
catalytic mechanisms. However, although the title of their
review, which echoes that of an earlier review of Knowles,
makes it clear why they will not supplant proteins as the
primary catalysts of metabolic reactions, their importance for
a better understanding of the origin of life is great. One of
the major problems with the older view of proteins as the
sole enzymes was that it seemed barely possible to synthesize
enzymes without nucleic acids, or nucleic acids without pro-
teins, but even more difﬁcult to imagine that the two kinds of
polymer could have originated independently. The existence
of catalytic RNA thus allows a more credible picture of the ori-
gin of life in which nucleic acids existed before proteins and
fulﬁlled some of the functions now associated with proteins.
They undoubtedly fulﬁlled these functions quite badly, as
1The success of Shih and co-workers for in designing DNA sequences
that spontaneously fold into preselected nanostructures makes this assertion
less clear than it once seemed to be, but it remains true that DNA has a much
more limited range of possible structures than proteins and RNA.
3.6 Catalytic antibodies

RNA molecules have a much more limited range of functional
groups than proteins, but this was of less importance in a
world where more efﬁcient competing catalysts did not exist.
Some of the early functions of RNA enzymes still survive in

we have learned from ribosome

the present world to fulﬁll major biological roles; for example,
the ribosome is an RNA enzyme, and Ramakrishnan and co-
workers have now studied its structure in great detail.
Catalytic RNA molecules have found important applica-
tions for manipulating the levels of genes, and hence of gene
products, in living organisms. This is because the basis of
their speciﬁcity for particular base sequences is well under-
stood, as it derives from the usual base pairing that underlies
the operation of the genetic code. Consequently the speciﬁcity
of a particular catalytic RNA with ribonuclease activity can be
modiﬁed by introducing appropriate base sequences comple-
mentary to sequences in the mRNA of the gene one wishes to
manipulate. This approach allowed Efrat and co-workers to
obtain transgenic mice with activities of hexokinase D in the
pancreatic islets much below the normal, while leaving the
activities of other hexokinase isoenzymes unaffected.

Catalytic antibodies
A catalytic antibody is a sort of natural artiﬁcial enzyme:
on the one hand it is a natural protein synthesized by the
usual biological processes; on the other hand it is intended
to catalyze a reaction for which no natural enzyme is avail-
able. The essential idea is to raise antibodies to a molecule
considered to mimic the transition state of the reaction that
is to be catalyzed, that is to say a molecule resembling a
strained structure intermediate between the substrate and
product, believed to occur on the reaction pathway (com-
pare Section 1.8.3). The hope is that some of the antibodies
§1.8.3, pages 18–21
produced will happen to possess groups capable of promot-
ing the reaction. Reviews of this ﬁeld (for example that of
Wentworth) tend to be written in the breathless style that one

nature” Science 296, 2247–2249
associates with other articles on artiﬁcial enzymes, sometimes
with abundant use of exclamation marks for readers who
might otherwise miss the excitement, but the achievements
to date have hardly justiﬁed it.

• Most enzymes are naturally occurring proteins, but several

other possibilities are now known. Kinetic analysis of all of
these variants follows the same principles as natural protein
enzymes.
• The term artiﬁcial enzyme (“synzyme”) has been used in

more than one sense, but it normally refers to a synthetic
chemical structure designed to mimic enzyme catalysis, or a
natural enzyme modiﬁed to have a new activity.
• Catalytic RNA consists of naturally occurring RNA mole-

cules (“ribozymes”) that catalyze some essential biological
processes.
• Catalytic antibodies (“abzymes”) are protein molecules ob-
§3.6, on the previous page
tained by using the capacity of the immune system to generate
new proteins that bind particular molecules with high speci-
ﬁcity, which are then harnessed as catalysts for reactions for
which no natural enzymes are known.

If it is unavoidable one can use a discontinuous assay (Fig-

the reaction mixture and analyzed to determine the extent
of reaction. It is more convenient to use a continuous assay
(Figure 4.2), in which the progress of the reaction is mon-
itored continuously with automatic recording apparatus. If
the reaction causes a change in absorbance at a conveniently
accessible wavelength it can easily be followed in a recording
spectrophotometer. For example, many reactions of biochem-
ical interest involve the interconversion of the oxidized and
reduced forms of NAD, and for these one can usually devise a
spectrophotometric assay that exploits the large absorbance of
reduced NAD at 340 nm. Even if no such convenient spectro-

Reactions for which no spectrophotometric assay is suit-

vantage of the release or consumption of protons that many
enzyme-catalyzed reactions involve. Such reactions may be
followed in unbuffered solutions with a “pH-stat”, an in-
strument that adds base or acid automatically and maintains
a constant pH, as described in a chapter by Brocklehurst.

Because of the stoichiometry of the reaction, a record of
the amount of base or acid added provides a record of the
progress of the reaction.
4.1.2
Estimating the initial rate
The subject matter of this section may appear old-fashioned,
as it deals with methods that have been almost entirely su-
perseded by automated ways of doing the same thing. Rather
than estimating initial rates by analyzing a curve on paper
with a ruler, it is now standard to obtain the initial rate of
a reaction from the software supplied with the spectropho-
tometer or other recording instrument. In principle there is
little objection to this, but in practice there may be serious
objections. Before investing trust in the numbers that emerge
from a machine an experimenter needs to be conﬁdent that
the numbers are properly calculated and that they are appro-
priate. To be “appropriate”, the number interpreted as an ini-
tial rate must have been computed as the slope of the tangent
to the progress curve at time zero and not, for example, as the
slope of a chord that approximates the curve during a ﬁnite
period of time. Use of an instrument with high standards of
optics and photometry does not guarantee that the built-in
software is of corresponding quality: for an example of an
M. L. Cárdenas and A. Cornish-
Bowden (1993) “Rounding
error: an unexpected fault in the
output from a recording spec-
trophotometer” Biochemical
Journal 292, 37–40
instrument supplied with software far inferior to the quality
of the instrument itself, see a discussion by Cárdenas and
Cornish-Bowden. Thus even if one rarely needs to estimate
an initial rate manually, one still needs to know how to do it
when necessary, and one always needs an appreciation of the
principles involved.
Ideally one must try to ﬁnd conditions in which the
progress curve is virtually straight during the period of mea-
surement.
Strictly speaking this is impossible, because re-

gardless of the mechanism of the reaction one expects the rate
to change—usually to decrease—as the substrates are con-
sumed, the products accumulate and, sometimes, the enzyme
loses activity.

its entire range.
the assay can be arranged so that less than 1% of the complete
reaction is followed the progress curve may then be indistin-
guishable from a straight line. This happy situation is less
common than one might think from reading the literature,
because many experimenters are reluctant to admit the in-
herent difﬁculty of drawing an accurate tangent to a curve,
and prefer to persuade themselves that their progress curves
are biphasic, with an initial “linear” period followed by a
tailing off. This nearly always causes the true initial rate to be
underestimated, for reasons that should be clear from Figure
4.3. Even if the line is constrained to pass through the origin,
it will tend to underestimate the true slope (albeit by less than
is shown in Figure 4.3) if the ﬁrst few time points are treated
as points on a straight line, especially if the straight line is not
constrained to pass through the origin.
To avoid the bias evident in Figure 4.3 one must be aware
of the problem and remember that one is trying to ﬁnd the
initial rate, not the average rate during the ﬁrst few minutes of
reaction, because it is the initial rate that appears in the kinetic
equations. So one must try to draw a tangent to the curve
extrapolated back to zero time, not a chord. For following
the progress of an enzyme puriﬁcation more reﬁnement than
this is hardly needed, as there is no need for highly precise
initial rates in this context. For subsequent kinetic study of

the puriﬁed enzyme, however, one may well want better-
deﬁned initial rates than one can hope to get by drawing
initial tangents by hand. In this case a method based on an
integrated rate equation, as discussed in Section 2.9, is likely
to be useful.
If the curve itself is clean and well deﬁned one can use
a glass rod as a ruler to draw a straight line at right angles
to the curve (from which the actual tangent can then easily
be found by drawing a second straight line at right angles to
the ﬁrst). This exploits a refractive property of the glass rod
such that any deviation from the correct angle is magniﬁed
when one looks at the curve through the glass. This property
is illustrated in Figure 4.4, though it can be seen more clearly
in a test with a real glass rod.

Increasing the straightness of the progress
curve
Provided that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is
proportional to the total enzyme concentration, as one usually
tries to ensure, the curvature of the progress curve cannot be
altered by using more or less enzyme (though using a lower
concentration may make it easier to judge the initial tangent).
It just alters the scale of the time axis and any apparent change
in curvature is an illusion; indeed, this property forms the
basis of Selwyn’s test for enzyme inactivation described in
Section 4.2.

Nonetheless, it may still be advantageous to use less
enzyme as it will decrease the amount of product formed
during the period between mixing the reagents and starting
to observe the reaction, in other words it can decrease the
proportion of the curve that cannot be directly observed.

Figure 4.6. Straightness of
progress curves. Although the
initial rate is not very different
for initial substrate concentra-
tions of 5Km and 10Km it
decreases much faster at the
lower initial concentration. To
make the effect easily visible the
times to decrease by 10% are
marked (rather than by 1% as
discussed in the text).
One can, however, improve the linearity of an assay by
increasing the substrate concentration, so long as the products
do not bind more tightly than the substrates to the enzyme
(as often happens, for example, in reactions in which the
oxidized form of NAD is converted to the reduced form). To
illustrate this effect of substrate concentration I shall consider
the simplest possible case, that of a reaction that obeys the
Michaelis–Menten equation and is not subject to product in-
hibition or retardation due to any cause apart from depletion
of substrate. In this case the progress curve is described by
equation 2.45, the naive integrated form of the Michaelis–
Menten equation, reproduced here:
Vt = p + Km ln

a0
a0 −p

If the initial substrate concentration a0 is 5Km, the initial rate
v0 is 0.83V, and is largely unaffected by small errors in a0.
Even if a0 is doubled to 10Km, v0 increases only by 9%, to
0.91V. So it might seem that the assay would be only trivially
improved, despite being made considerably more expensive,
by using the higher initial substrate concentration.
But if
curvature is a prime concern this conclusion is mistaken, as
we may see by making some simple calculations with equa-
tions 2.44 and 2.45. For a0 = 5Km, with initial rate 0.833V,
a decrease by 1% gives a rate of 0.825V, corresponding (from
equation 2.44) to p = 0.23Km, which gives t = 0.34Km/V when
substituted into equation 2.45. For a0 = 10Km, however, the
same calculation gives 99% of the initial rate for p = Km, at
4.1 Enzyme assays
89
t = 1.11Km/V. Thus it takes more than three times as long for
the rate to decrease by 1% in the second case than in the ﬁrst.
In practice this calculation will usually be an oversimpli-
ﬁcation, because nearly all enzyme-catalyzed reactions are
inhibited by their products, but the principle still applies
qualitatively: increasing the initial substrate concentration
usually extends the “linear” period, unless products bind
more tightly than substrates. Do not forget, however, that the
property of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases noted above
makes this last qualiﬁcation an important one.
Another reason for using as high a substrate concentration
in an enzyme assay as cost, solubility and substrate inhibition
allow1 is that this minimizes the sensitivity of the assay to
small errors in the substrate concentration, not only during
the course of the reaction, as just discussed, but also from
one experiment to another. Working with a0 = 0.1Km, for
example, requires precisely prepared solutions and great care,
because a 10% error in a0 generates almost a 10% error in
the measured rate; when a0 = 10Km, however, much less
precision is needed because a 10% error in a0 generates less
than a 1% error in the measured rate.
§4.3, pages 95–102
Whether or not steps are taken to increase the straightness
of a progress curve, it is a good idea to observe a reaction
mixture for a long enough period for the curvature to be easily
visible. Even if the later stages are not used in the analysis,
their presence in the trace will tend to decrease the probability
of the error of treating any part of the curve as if it is straight,
making the faults illustrated in Figure 4.3 less likely.
4.1.4
Coupled assays
When it is not possible or convenient to follow a reaction di-
rectly in a spectrophotometer it may still be possible to follow
it indirectly by “coupling” it to another reaction. Consider,
for example, the hexokinase-catalyzed transfer of a phosphate
group from ATP to glucose:
glucose + ATP →glucose 6-phosphate + ADP
This reaction is not accompanied by any convenient spec-
trophotometric change, but it may nonetheless be followed
1Note that here we are considering assays made for determining the
enzyme activity. Assays made for determining the kinetic parameters follow
different rules, as described in Section 4.3, and require measurements over a
range of substrate concentrations, both high and low.

spectrophotometrically by coupling it to the following reac-
tion, catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase:
glucose 6-phosphate + NADoxidized →
6-phosphogluconate + NADreduced
(4.1)
Provided that the activity of the coupling enzyme is high
enough for the glucose 6-phosphate to be oxidized as fast
as it is produced, the rate of NAD reduction recorded in
the spectrophotometer will correspond exactly to the rate of
the reaction of interest. The requirements for a satisfactory
coupled assay may be expressed in simple but general terms
by means of the scheme

(4.2)
in which the conversion of A into B at rate v1 is the reaction
of interest and the conversion of B into C is the coupling
reaction, with a rate v2 that can readily be measured. Plainly
measurements of v2 will provide accurate information about
the initial value of v1 only if a steady state in the concentration
of B is reached before v1 decreases perceptibly from its initial
value. Some treatments of this system assume that v2 must
have a ﬁrst-order dependence on b, but this is both unrealistic
and unnecessary, and can lead to the design of assays that
use more materials than necessary, which may not only be
wasteful but may have undesirable side effects as well. As
the coupling reaction is usually enzyme-catalyzed, it is more
appropriate to suppose that v2 depends on b according to the
Michaelis–Menten equation:
v2 =
V2b

in which the subscripts 2 are to emphasize that V2 and Km2 are
the Michaelis–Menten parameters of the second (coupling)

Cornish-Bowden. It leads to the conclusion that the time t
required for v2 to reach any speciﬁed fraction of v1 is given by
an equation of the form
t = φKm2/v1
in which φ is a dimensionless number that depends only on
the ratios v2/v1 and v1/V2. For example, suppose that v1 is
0.1 mM · min−1, V2, the limiting rate of the coupling enzyme,
is 0.5 mM · min−1, so v1/V2 = 0.2, so one is trying to measure
a rate that is 20% of the limiting rate of the coupling reaction.
In this case the value of φ in Table 4.1 v2/v1 = 0.99 is 1.31:
this means that the time required to reach 99% of the target
rate is 1.31 × 0.2/0.1 min, or 2.62 min. Discretion is needed
for deciding what value of v2/v1 is appropriate, as use of 0.99
when 0.9 would do will produce an unnecessarily expensive
assay, and using 0.9 when 0.99 is needed will produce an
inadequate one. There is no universal answer to this question.
For following the progress of a puriﬁcation of an enzyme
high accuracy is not needed, and general physiological char-
acterization of an enzyme is hardly more demanding, even in
modern proteomic studies. On the other hand analysis of the
kinetic variations of a series of mutants forms of an enzyme
for studying the relations between structure and function
require the highest accuracy available: if the numbers that
emerge from such a study are not accurate they are hardly
worth having at all.
The validity of this treatment can be checked by following
the coupling reaction over a period of time and showing that
the value of v2 does increase in the way expected. An example

to the theory outlined in the

of such a check is shown in Figure 4.7. In that experiment V2
was deliberately made rather smaller than would be appro-
priate for a satisfactory assay in order to make the period of
acceleration clearly visible.
Even if the reaction of interest can be assayed directly it
is sometimes advantageous to couple it to a second reaction.
For example, if one of the products of the ﬁrst reaction is a
powerful inhibitor, or if a reversible reaction is being studied
in the less favored direction, so that equilibrium is reached
after only a small proportion of substrate has reacted, it may
be difﬁcult to measure the initial rate accurately. Problems of
this kind can often be overcome by coupling the reaction to
an irreversible reaction that removes the inhibitory product
or displaces the equilibrium, as analyzed by Tang and Leyh.

In these cases much the same analysis as before applies, but
92
4. Practical Aspects of Kinetic Studies
with a stricter deﬁnition of the steady state of the reaction.
The steady-state value of b in the scheme considered above
is obtained by setting v2 = v1 and solving equation 4.3 for b,
which gives b = Km2v1/(V −v1). It is then a simple matter
to decide how large V2 must be if the steady-state value of b
is not to be large enough to create problems.
Coupling enzymes, used especially as ATP-regenerating
systems, can also be valuable for maintaining the concentra-
tion of a reactant as constant as possible. By adding pyruvate
kinase to an assay mixture, for example, with excess ADP and
phosphoenolpyruvate, one can ensure that ATP is regenerated
by the following reaction as fast as it is consumed:
ADP + phosphoenolpyruvate →pyruvate + ATP
(4.4)
In a variant of this approach, Chittock and co-workers showed

skyj, J. Holah and C. W. Whar-
ton (1998) “Kinetic aspects of
ATP ampliﬁcation reactions”

how it could be used as an ampliﬁcation system for detecting
and measuring small concentrations of ATP.
Sometimes it is necessary to couple a reaction with two
or more coupling enzymes. For example, the coupled assay
for hexokinase based on the reaction in equation 4.1 would
be useless for studying inhibition of hexokinase by glucose 6-
phosphate, because the coupling system would remove not
only the glucose 6-phosphate released in the reaction but
also any added by the experimenter. In this case one would
need to couple the production of ADP to the oxidation of
NAD, which can be done with two enzymes, pyruvate kinase
(equation 4.4) and lactate dehydrogenase:
pyruvate + NADreduced →lactate + NADoxidized
Rigorous kinetic analysis of systems with two or more cou-
pling enzymes is difﬁcult, but qualitatively they resemble the
simple case we have considered: one must ensure that the ac-
tivities of the coupling enzymes are high enough for the mea-
sured rate to reach an appropriate percentage of the required
rate within the period the required rate remains effectively
constant. This can most easily be checked by experiment: if
the concentrations of the coupling enzymes are high enough
the observed rate should be proportional to the concentration
of the enzyme of interest over the whole range to be used. As
Easterby has discussed, the times required for the two or more

coupling enzymes to reach their steady states are additive,
and so one can calculate a reasonably accurate total time quite
easily.
In all of these cases there may be reasons other than ex-
pense for not using more coupling enzyme than is absolutely
4.2 Detecting enzyme inactivation

necessary for an efﬁcient assay. Unless the coupling enzyme is
as carefully puriﬁed as the target enzyme one has the danger
that impurities may catalyze unwanted reactions that inter-
fere with the assay, and even if it is quite pure it may have
unwanted activities of its own that are best minimized. For
example, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase not only cat-
alyzes the oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate (equation 4.1) but
also has a weak activity towards glucose. Similar potential
dangers apply in all coupled assays as one always has the
risk that an enzyme chosen for its capacity to react with the
product of a reaction may also react with its substrate.
4.2
Detecting enzyme inactivation
Many enzymes are much more stable at high concentrations
than at low, so it is not uncommon for an enzyme to lose
activity rapidly when it is diluted from a stable stock solution
to the much lower concentration used in the assay. This can
obviously lead to errors in the estimate of the general level of
activity, but, less obviously, it may also produce errors in the
type of behavior reported. It is often the case that an enzyme–
substrate complex is more stable than the corresponding free
enzyme, and consequently enzymes often lose activity more
slowly at high substrate concentrations. If this effect is not
noticed, the abnormally low activity observed at low sub-
strate concentrations can be falsely attributed to cooperativity
(Chapter 12),
that is to say to deviations of the initial rate

from Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Even if there are no effects
as serious as this, assay conditions that minimize inactivation
are likely to give results more reproducible than they would
otherwise be, and in any case it is of interest to know whether
the decrease in rate that occurs during the reaction is caused
wholly or partly by loss of enzyme activity (rather than by
substrate depletion or accumulation of products, for exam-
ple). Fortunately there is a simple test of this.
Selwyn pointed out that as long as the rate dp/dt at all
times during a reaction is proportional to the initial total en-
zyme concentration e0 then it can be expressed as the product
of the constant e0 times some function of the instantaneous
concentrations of the substrates, products, inhibitors and any
other species (apart from the enzyme) that may be present.
But because of the stoichiometry of the reaction, these con-
centrations can in principle be calculated from p, the concen-
tration of one product at any time. So the rate equation can be
94
4. Practical Aspects of Kinetic Studies
written in the simple form
dp
dt = e0f(p)
(4.5)
where f is a function that can in principle be derived from the
rate equation. It is of no importance that f may be difﬁcult to
derive or that it may be a complicated function of p, because
its exact form is not required. It is sufﬁcient to know that
it is independent of e0 and t, and so the integrated form of
equation 4.5 must be
e0t = F(p)
where F is another function. The practical importance of this
equation is that it shows that the value of e0t after a speciﬁed
amount of product has been formed is independent of e0. So
if progress curves are obtained with various values of e0 but
otherwise identical starting conditions, plots of p against e0t
for the various e0 values should be superimposable. If they
are not, the initial assumption that the rate is proportional
throughout the reaction to the initial total enzyme concentra-
tion must be incorrect. Figure 4.8 shows an example of this
plot, with the results expected for a satisfactory assay.
The simplest reason why Selwyn’s test may fail, as in
Figure 4.9, is that e0 varies because the enzyme loses activity
during the reaction. Selwyn lists several other possibilities, all
of which indicate either that the assay is unsatisfactory or that
it is complicated in some way that ought to be investigated
before it is used routinely.

use of the test to compare the effectiveness of different anions
in stabilizing a bacterial arsenate reductase is described by
Flores and coworkers.
Selwyn’s test is less widely applied than its importance
would suggest, but the enormous growth in the use of genetic
techniques for producing mutant enzymes, which are usually
less stable than their natural counterparts, has recreated a
need for a reliable way of recognizing if they become inac-
tivated during assay. Without this, comparisons between rea-
sonably stable natural enzymes and much less stable variants
are often likely to be invalidated by artefacts.
The principle embodied in the test was widely known in
the early years of enzymology: the data used for constructing
Figure 4.8 were taken from Michaelis and Davidsohn, and
similar data were given by Hudson; it is clear, moreover,
from Haldane’s discussion in his book that similar tests were

applied to many enzymes. As early as 1890, O’Sullivan and
Tompson commented that “the time necessary to reach any
given percentage of inversion [hydrolysis of sucrose] is in
inverse proportion to the amount of the inverting preparation
present; that is to say, the time is in inverse proportion to the
inverting agent”. In spite of this, the test was largely forgotten
until Selwyn adapted Michaelis and Davidsohn’s treatment
and discussed the various reasons why it might fail.
4.3
Experimental design
4.3.1
Choice of substrate concentrations
A full account of the design of kinetic experiments would
require a great deal of space, and this section is only a brief
and simpliﬁed guide.
In general, the conditions that are
optimal for assaying an enzyme, or determining the amount
of catalytic activity in a sample, are unlikely to be ideal for
determining its kinetic parameters. The reason is that in an
enzyme assay one tries to ﬁnd conditions where the measured
rate depends only on the enzyme concentration, so that slight
variations in other conditions will have little effect; but in an
investigation of the kinetic properties of an enzyme one is
concerned to know how it responds to changes in conditions.
It is essential in the latter case to work over a wide range of
substrate concentrations in which the rate varies appreciably.
In practice, for an enzyme that obeys the Michaelis–Menten
equation this means that the a values should extend from
well below Km to well above Km. If the highest concentration
is too small (Figure 4.10) the experiment cannot yield much
information about V; if it is too high (Figure 4.11) it cannot
yield much information about V/Km; and as Km is obtained
by dividing V by V/Km it will not be well deﬁned by either
of these designs. Finally, if all the substrate concentrations are
contained in a narrow range (Figure 4.12) the experiment will
not provide useful information about any of the parameters.

or V/Km.
If one is conﬁdent that one is dealing with an enzyme that
obeys the Michaelis–Menten equation, one need only con-
sider what range of a values will deﬁne Km and V precisely. It
is easy to decide how to deﬁne V precisely, by recalling that v
approaches V as a becomes very large (Section 2.3); obviously
§2.3, pages 32–38
therefore it is desirable to include some a values as large as
cost, solubility and other constraints (such as high speciﬁc
absorbance in the spectrophotometer) permit. In principle,
the larger the largest a value the better, but in reality there are
96
4. Practical Aspects of Kinetic Studies
two reasons why this may not be so. First, one’s conﬁdence
that the Michaelis–Menten equation is obeyed may be mis-
placed: many enzymes show substrate inhibition (Section 6.9.2)
at high a values, and as a result the v values measured at
very high a may not be those expected from the Km and V
values that deﬁne the kinetics at low and moderate a. Second,
even if the Michaelis–Menten equation is accurately obeyed,
the advantage of including a values greater than about 10Km
is slight and may well be outweighed by the added cost in
materials. Moreover, if the substrate is an ion it may become
difﬁcult to avoid varying the ionic strength when very high
concentrations are used.
One limit to the maximum substrate concentration that
can be used is imposed by the speciﬁc absorbance of the
substrate or product used for the assay. For example, many
assays depend on the absorbance of reduced NAD at 340 nm,
about 0.9 in a 1 cm cuvette for a 0.15 mM solution. This might
suggest that it would be difﬁcult to use assays with a much
higher concentration, but in fact use of 0.2 cm cuvettes allows
a ﬁve-fold extension of the range. Curiously, 1 cm cells have
become so familiar that many modern experimenters appear
not to know (or to have forgotten) that other pathlengths are
possible. Longer pathlengths, such as 5 or 10 cm, are useful
for assaying solution that absorb weakly, but these may be
less convenient to use as they are more likely to require special
modiﬁcations to the spectrophotometer itself. Just as the rate
at high a is largely determined by V, so the rate at low a is
largely determined by V/Km (see Section 2.3, as the slope of
the tangent at the origin is V/Km. So for V/Km to be well
deﬁned it is necessary to have some observations at a values
less than Km, and for V to be well deﬁned it is necessary to
have some observations at a values greater than Km.

It is sometimes thought that the value of Km is mainly
determined by the rates obtained at substrate concentrations
close to the true Km. For example, in a widely cited review
W. W. Cleland (1967) “The
statistical analysis of enzyme
kinetic data” Advances in
Enzymology and Related Areas of
Molecular Biology 29, 1–32
Cleland wrote that
It is the velocities obtained at substrate levels
around K that are more important than either the
higher or the lower ones in determining K.
It should be evident from Figure 4.12, however, that that is
mistaken, and that curves with a wide range of different Km
values could be drawn to give a reasonable ﬁt to the points
around Km. Without an adequate indication of the behavior
at high and low substrate concentrations it is impossible to
4.3 Experimental design
97
get an adequate indication of the value of Km. Deﬁning Km
therefore needs accurate values of both V and V/Km, so a
should range from about 0.1Km to about 10Km or as high as
conveniently possible (Figure 4.13). It is not necessary to go
to the lowest a values for which measurements are possible,
however, because the need for v to be zero when a is zero
provides a ﬁxed point on the plot of v against a through which
the curve must pass. As a result there is little advantage in
using a values less than about 0.1Km. Endrenyi made some
theoretical studies under rather idealized conditions, which
suggest that if v has a constant standard deviation (Figure
4.14) the optimum value for the low end of the range may be
as high as 0.4Km (the exact value depending on the high end
of the range), but if v has a constant coefﬁcient of variation the
optimum value for the low end of the range is zero (Figure
4.15).
However, one should be cautious about taking the
ﬁrst part of this result too literally, because it was derived
for conditions that may not be satisﬁed in a real experiment.
In practice one rarely knows with sufﬁcient certainty that the
curve passes through the origin or that the Michaelis–Menten
equation is obeyed with sufﬁcient accuracy to justify omit-
ting observations at low substrate concentration, regardless
of what the theoretical analysis may suggest.

It cannot be overemphasized that the above remarks were
prefaced with the condition that one must be conﬁdent that the
Michaelis–Menten equation is obeyed, and N-acetylglucosamine
kinase provides a striking illustration of the dangers of ig-
noring this. This enzyme was often mistakenly reported as
a glucokinase in various tissues, but wildly different values
of Km for glucose were reported by different groups, from as
low as 1 mM to as high as 280 mM. Vera and co-workers were

able to explain the discrepancies when they realized, ﬁrst that
the true physiological substrate was N-acetylglucosamine,
and second that far from being straight the double-reciprocal
plots with glucose as substrate were strongly curved over
a wide range (Figure 4.16). However, if observations were
made only in a small range of substrate concentrations around
the expected Km the plot could be interpreted as straight ad
consistent with whatever Km value was expected. Cárdenas
gives a thorough account of the confusion in her book.

In practice one may not care whether the Michaelis–
Menten equation is obeyed or not outside the range of the
experiment.
If one’s interests are primarily physiological
there is no reason to want to know about deviations from sim-
ple behavior at grossly unphysiological concentrations; but if
98
4. Practical Aspects of Kinetic Studies
one is interested in enzyme mechanisms one should certainly
explore as wide a range of conditions as possible, because
deviations from the expected behavior at the extremes of the
experiment may well provide clues to the mechanism. Hill,

G. Bardsley (1977) “Does any
enzyme follow the Michaelis–
Menten equation?” Molecular

Waight and Bardsley argued that there may be few enzymes
(if indeed there are any at all) that truly obey the Michaelis–
Menten equation: excessively limited experimental designs,
coupled with unwillingness to take note of deviations from
expected behavior, may have led to an unwarranted belief
that the Michaelis–Menten equation is almost universally
obeyed.
The Michaelis–Menten equation will undoubtedly remain
useful as a ﬁrst approximation in enzyme kinetics, even if
it may sometimes need to be rejected after careful measure-
ments, but it is always advisable to check for the commonest
deviations. Is the rate truly zero in the absence of substrate
(and enzyme, for that matter)? If not, is the discrepancy small
enough to be accounted for by instrumental drift or other
experimental error? If there is a signiﬁcant “blank rate” in
the absence of substrate or enzyme, can it be removed by
careful puriﬁcation? Does the rate approach zero at a values
appreciably greater than zero?
If so one should check for
evidence of cooperativity (Chapter 12). Is there any evidence
of substrate inhibition, that is to say of a decrease in v as a
increases? Even if there is no decrease in v at high a values,
failure to increase as much as predicted by the Michaelis–
Menten equation (see Figure 2.3) may indicate substrate in-
hibition. Some of the points to be checked are illustrated in

Choice of pH, temperature and other conditions
Even if one does not intend to study the pH and temper-
ature dependence of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, atten-
tion must still be given to the choice of pH and tempera-
ture. For many purposes it will be appropriate to work un-
der approximately physiological conditions—pH 7.2, 37 ◦C ,
ionic strength 0.15 mol l−1 for most mammalian enzymes, for
example—but there may be good reasons for deviating from
these in a mechanistic study. Many enzymes become dena-
tured appreciably fast at 37 ◦C and may be much more stable
at 25 ◦C (though there are exceptions, so this should not be
taken as a universal rule). It is also advisable to choose a pH at
which the reaction rate is insensitive to small changes in pH.
This is sometimes expressed as a recommendation to work at
4.3 Experimental design
99
the pH “optimum”, but, as will become clear in Chapter 10,
Chapter 10, pages 253–271
this may well be meaningless advice if Km varies with pH:
if so, then even though the Michaelis–Menten equation may
be obeyed the maximum value of V/Km will not occur at the
same pH as the maximum value of V, and the “optimum” pH
will be different at different substrate concentrations.
In studies of reactions with more than one substrate, the
experimental design must obviously be more complex than
that required for one-substrate reactions, but the principles
are similar.
Each substrate concentration should be varied
over a wide enough range for its effect on the rate to be man-
ifest. If the Michaelis–Menten equation is obeyed when any
single substrate concentration is varied under conditions that
are otherwise constant, the measured values of the Michaelis–
Menten parameters are apparent values, and are likely to
change when the other conditions are changed.
To obtain
the maximum information, therefore, one needs to choose a
range of substrate concentrations in relation to the appropri-
ate apparent Km, not the limiting Km as the other substrate or
substrates approach saturation, which may not be relevant.
I shall return to this topic in Chapter 8 after introducing the
Chapter 8, pages 189–226
basic equation for a two-substrate reaction. Similar consid-
erations apply in studies of inhibition, and are discussed in
Chapter 6.
Chapter 6, pages 133–168
4.3.3
Use of replicate observations
At the end of a kinetic study one always ﬁnds that the best
equation one can determine fails to ﬁt every observation
exactly. The question then arises whether the discrepancies
are small enough to be dismissed as experimental error, or
whether they indicate the need for a more complicated rate
equation. Answering this requires an idea of the magnitude
of the random error in the experiment, which is most easily
obtained in a clear way by comparing replicate observations.
If these agree with one another much better than they agree
with the ﬁtted line there are grounds for rejecting the ﬁtted
line and perhaps introducing more terms into the equation. If,
on the other hand, there is about as much scatter within each
group of replicates as there is between the ﬁtted line and the
points, there are no grounds for rejecting the equation until
more precise observations become available.
This approach is possible because in a repeated experi-
ment one knows what the degree of agreement ought to be
if there were no random error. Hence such an experiment
100
4. Practical Aspects of Kinetic Studies
measures only random error, often called pure error in this
context to distinguish it from the lack of ﬁt that results from
ﬁtting an inadequate equation. The disagreement between
an observation and a ﬁtted line, on the other hand, may be
caused either by error in the observation, or inadequacy of
the theory, or, most likely, a combination of the two; it does
not therefore measure pure error.

Figure 4.20. Use of repeated
observations. When observa-

as in Figures 4.21–22.

Figure 4.22. Correlated scatter.
Each group of three replicates
shows essentially the same
arrangement: two high points,
one low point.
The use of replicate observations is not without its pitfalls.
To give a meaningful result the disagreement between two
replicates must be truly representative of the random error
in the experiment as a whole. This will be true only if the
repeated measurements are made just like any others, and
not in any special way. This is perhaps best understood by
examining the three examples shown in Figures 4.20–22. In
Figure 4.20 the points are scattered within each group of repli-
cates to about the same extent as all the points are scattered
about the line; this is what one expects if there is no lack of
ﬁt and the repeated measurements have been made correctly,
just like any others. In Figure 4.21 the scatter within each
group of replicates is much less than the scatter about the
line, even though the latter scatter does appear to be random
rather than systematic. This is an unsatisfactory result, which
can arise from various kinds of design fault: perhaps the
most common is to measure all of the observations within a
group in succession, so that the time between them is small
compared with the average for the experiment. If this is done,
then any error caused by slow changes during the whole
experiment—for example, instrumental drift, deterioration
of stock solutions, increase in ambient temperature, fatigue
of the experimenter—will not be properly reﬂected by the
repeats.
Figure 4.22 shows the opposite problem.
In this case
the arrangement of each group of replicates is suspiciously
regular, with a spread that is noticeably larger than the spread
of points about the ﬁtted line. This suggests that the repeats
are overestimating the actual random error, perhaps because
the ﬁgure actually represents three separate experiments done
on three different days or with three different samples of
enzyme.
The question of how many repeats there ought to be in
a kinetic experiment is not one that can be answered dog-
matically. For any individual study the answer must depend
on how much work is needed for each measurement, how
long the enzyme and other stock solutions can be kept in an
essentially constant state, how large the experimental error
4.3 Experimental design
101
is, and how complicated the equation to be ﬁtted is.
The
ﬁrst essential is to include as many different concentrations
of substrate (and any other relevant components of the sys-
tem, such as inhibitors) as are needed to characterize the
shape of the curve adequately. A one-substrate enzyme that
obeyed straightforward Michaelis–Menten kinetics might be
adequately characterized with as few as ﬁve substrate con-
centrations in the range 0.5Km to 5Km; but a two-substrate en-
zyme, again with straightforward kinetics, might well require
a minimum of 25 different combinations of concentrations;
and enzymes that showed deviations from simple kinetics
would certainly require these numbers to be increased.
These estimates assume that full analysis of the data will
involve graphs as well as statistical calculations in the com-
puter. So far as the latter are concerned there is no need for the
concentrations to be organized as a grid, even approximately,
as it does not affect the validity of the calculations if a line
calculated as one of a family of lines has only one point on it;
thus a two-substrate experiment could in principle give sat-
isfactory results with as few as eight different combinations
of concentrations. The important point is to concentrate ob-
servations in the regions that give the most information about
the validity of the model proposed. However, the human eye
can readily spot unexpected behavior on a graph that would
pass unnoticed by even the best of computer programs, and
for this reason it is unwise to rely wholly on the computer. For
example, suppose that the following series of pairs represent
a set of (a, v) pairs listed in the order the measurements were
made: (12.0, 17.5), (1.5, 6.45), (6.0, 12.2), (15.0, 14.9), (0.5, 2.92),
(8.0, 13.2), (2.0, 7.67), (20.0, 15.4), (10.0, 13.8), (5.0, 11.5), (1.0,
4.97), (3.0, 9.37). How obvious is it just from examining the
numbers which observation is anomalous? Even if they are
rearranged in order of increasing a, (0.5, 2.92), (1.0, 4.97), (1.5,
6.45), (2.0, 7.67), (3.0, 9.37), (5.0, 11.5), (6.0, 12.2), (8.0, 13.2),
(10.0, 13.8), (12.0, 17.5), (15.0, 14.9), (20.0, 15.4), how obvious
is it now? More obvious, certainly, but if the points are plotted
on a graph (Figure 4.23) the anomaly leaps out at the eye, even
in a plot of rate against concentration.

differences between the points

The greatly expanded ordinate
scale makes the anomalous
point more obvious. The reason
for the graying out of the axes
and the absence of labeling is
explained in Section 15.8
(pages 443–448).
Less obvious anomalies can still often be made obvious
by making a residual plot, that is to say a plot of differences
between observed and calculated rates against substrate con-
centration, as discussed in Section 15.8, and illustrated in Fig-
§15.8, pages 443–448
ure 4.24. Comparison of the plots in Figures 4.23–24 illustrate
not only that the obvious anomaly at the third highest a value
is even more obvious in the residual plot, but also that the
102
4. Practical Aspects of Kinetic Studies
other points deviate systematically from the line. This sys-
tematic behavior is entirely caused by the anomalous point,
and would disappear if it were not considered when drawing
the line.
In a case like this, where the deviation of the anomalous
point is huge compared with the dispersion of the other
points around the line, the most likely explanation is a typo-
graphical error, but less obvious anomalies are still much eas-
ier to recognize on a graph than they are in a list of numbers.
A good computer program should be able to recognize and
draw attention to anomalies, but by no means all of those in
everyday use today do so. You may like to test the program
you commonly use with the data set given in this example,
to see whether it just reports the result or if it gives any
indication that something is wrong.,
The need to be able to show data graphically places a
constraint on the experimental design, because a satisfactory
graph needs to have a reasonable number of points on ev-
ery line. Only after deciding the number of different com-
binations of concentrations to be used can one make any
intelligent decision about the number of replicates. Suppose
that 25 different combinations are considered necessary and
that it is possible and convenient to measure 60 rates in the
time available for the experiment, or the time during which
deterioration of the enzyme is negligible. In such a case it
would be appropriate to do ten sets of triplicates—spread
over the whole experiment, not concentrated in one part of
it—and the rest as duplicates. If, on the other hand, one could
only manage 30 measurements one would have to decrease
the number of repeats.
To advocate a universal rule, that
each measurement should be done in triplicate, for example,
seems to me to be silly, not only because it oversimpliﬁes the
problem, but also because it may lead to experiments in which
too few different sets of conditions are studied to provide the
information sought.

Treatment of ionic equilibria
The substrates of many reactions of biochemical interest are
ions that exist in equilibrium with other ions, some of which
have their own interactions with the enzymes catalyzing the
reactions. Although it is usually the total concentration of the
different ionic states that is easily controlled, it is the indi-
vidual ions that enter into chemical mechanisms, and so one

requires a method of calculating their concentrations. Most
notable of these ions is MgATP2−, the true substrate of most
of the enzymes that are loosely described as ATP-dependent.
It is impossible to prepare a solution of pure MgATP2−, be-

cause any solution that contains MgATP2−must also contain
numerous other ions (Figure 4.25); for example, an equimolar
mixture of ATP and MgCl2 at pH 7 contains appreciable pro-
portions of MgATP2−, ATP4−, HATP3−, Mg2+ and Cl−, as
well as traces of MgHATP−, Mg2ATP and MgCl+. Moreover,
their proportions vary with the total ATP and MgCl2 concen-
trations, the pH, the ionic strength and the concentrations of
any other species present (such as buffer components).
For example, studying the effect of MgATP2−on an en-
zyme obviously requires some assurance that effects attrib-
uted to MgATP2−are indeed due to that ion and not to varia-
tions in the Mg2+ and ATP4−concentrations that accompany
variations in the MgATP2−concentration.

account of this possibility may lead to quite spurious sug-
gestions of cooperativity or other deviations from Michaelis–
Menten kinetics with respect to MgATP2−. It is necessary,
therefore, to have some method of calculating the composi-
tion of a mixture of ions, and it is desirable to have some way
of varying the concentration of one ion without concomitant
large variations in the concentrations of other ions.
The stability constants of many of the complex ions of bio-
chemical interest (including all of those mentioned already)
have been measured. It is thus a simple matter to calculate
the concentration of any complex if the concentrations of
the components are known.
The problem usually appears
in inverse form, however: given the total concentrations of
the components of a mixture how can one calculate the free
concentrations? For example, given the total ATP and MgCl2
concentrations, the pH and all relevant equilibrium constants,
how can the concentration of MgATP2−be calculated?
Various iterative methods for solving this problem have
been proposed (see Perrin and Sayce; Storer and Cornish-
Bowden; Kuzmic) but the ready availability today of pow-
erful software for solving equations, such as Mathematica2,
Matlab3 or Maple4, has made these approaches obsolete. The
simplest and most general way of handling the problem today
is to write equations for the equilibrium constants for all of

and is not even approximately

centrations.
Various different experimental designs for varying the
concentration of MgATP2−in a simple way while keeping
variations in the concentrations under control have been pro-
posed. Three designs are in common use, of which one gives
good results and the others give unacceptably poor results.
The “good” design is to keep the total MgCl2 concentration in
constant excess over the total ATP concentration (Figure 4.26).
The best results are obtained with an excess of about 5 mM
MgCl2, but if the enzyme is inhibited by free Mg2+ or if there
are other reasons for wanting to minimize the concentration
of free Mg2+, the excess can be lowered to 1 mM with only
small losses of efﬁciency. If the excess is greater than 10 mM
there may be complications due to the presence of signiﬁcant
concentrations of Mg2ATP. With this design the ATP concen-
tration may be varied over a wide range (1 µM to 0.1 M at
least) with a high and almost constant proportion of the ATP
existing as MgATP2−and a nearly constant concentration of
free Mg2+. Thus effects due to variation in the concentration
of MgATP2−may be clearly separated from effects due to
variation in the free concentration of Mg2+.
The two “bad” design are unfortunately both in common
use. The ﬁrst is to vary the total concentrations of ATP and
MgCl2 in constant ratio (Figure 4.27). Whether this ratio is
1:1 or any other, this design leads to wild variations in the
proportion of ATP existing in any particular form, and cannot
be recommended. The second, also not to be recommended, is
to keep the total MgCl2 concentration constant at a value that
exceeds the highest ATP concentration by about 2–5 mM. Al-
though this does ensure that ATP exists largely as MgATP2−,
it can produce undesirably large variations in the concentra-

tions of free Mg2+ and of Mg2ATP. Moreover, as illustrated
in Figure 4.28, it fails badly if the total ATP concentration is
made too high.

concentrations.
Although the conclusions outlined in the preceding para-
graphs depend to some degree on the numerical values of the
equilibrium constants for complexes of Mg2+, ATP4−and H+,
the principles are general. As a rough guide, a component A
of a binary complex AB exists largely in complexed form if B
is maintained in excess over A by an amount about 100 times
the dissociation constant of AB.
In this discussion I have simpliﬁed the problem by ignor-
ing that ionic equilibrium constants strictly deﬁne ratios of
activities rather than concentrations, as explained by Alberty.

In practice, therefore, to avoid the complication of dealing
with activity coefﬁcients one must work at constant ionic
strength. A value of about 0.15 mol l−1 is appropriate, both
because it is close to the ionic strength of many living cells
and because many of the equilibria of biochemical interest are
insensitive to variations in the ionic strength near this value.

by considering only some of the ions that occur in typical
biochemical mixtures.

Problems
Solutions and notes are on pages 461–462.
4.1 Hexokinase A from mammalian brain is strongly in-
hibited by glucose 6-phosphate at concentrations above
0.1 mM. What must the limiting rate V2 of glucose 6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (Km = 0.11 mM for glucose
6-phosphate) be if it is required as coupling enzyme in
an assay in which rates v1 not exceeding 0.1 mM min−1
are to be measured and the concentration of glucose 6-
phosphate is never to exceed 0.1 mM?
4.2 Maintaining a total MgCl2 concentration 5 mM in excess
of the total ATP concentration ensures that effects due to
MgATP2−and Mg2+ can be clearly separated, because it
allows the MgATP2−concentration to be varied with lit-
tle concomitant variation in the free Mg2+ concentration.
However, it does not permit unequivocal distinction be-
tween effects of MgATP2−and of ATP4−, because it keeps
their concentrations almost in constant ratio. Suggest a
design that would allow the MgATP2−concentration to
be varied with little variation in the ATP4−concentration.

Deriving Steady-state Rate
Equations
5.1
Introduction
In principle, the steady-state rate equation for any mechanism
can be derived in the same way as that for the two-step
Michaelis–Menten mechanism: ﬁrst write down expressions
for the rates of change of concentrations of all but one of the
enzyme forms; next set them all to zero; write down an addi-
tional equation to express the sum of all these concentrations
as a constant; ﬁnally solve the simultaneous equations that
result.
In practice this method is extremely laborious and
liable to error for all but the simplest mechanisms, because it
generates many terms that subsequently need to be canceled
from the ﬁnal result. Fortunately, King and Altman described
E. L. King and C. Altman (1956)
“A schematic method of deriv-
ing the rate laws for enzyme-
catalyzed reactions” Journal of
Physical Chemistry 60, 1375–1378
a schematic method that is simple to apply to any mechanism
that consists of a series of reactions between different forms
of one enzyme. It is not applicable to nonenzymic reactions,
to mixtures of enzymes, or to mechanisms that contain non-
enzymic steps. Nonetheless, it is applicable to most of the sit-
uations met with in enzyme catalysis and is useful in practice.
It is described and discussed in this chapter.
It is not necessary to understand the theory of the King–
Altman method in order to apply it, and indeed the theory
is much more difﬁcult than the practice. Readers unfamil-

fore prefer to proceed directly to the description in Section 5.3.
§5.3, pages 113–116
However, understanding a method makes it easier to appre-
ciate its scope and limitations, and for this reason the theory
is given in the next section.
5.2
The principle of the King–Altman method
Consider a mechanism involving n different enzyme forms,
E1, E2...En, and suppose that reversible ﬁrst-order (or pseudo-
ﬁrst-order) reactions are possible between all pairs of species
Ei and Ej, and let the rate constant for Ei →Ej be kij and that
for Ej →Ei be kji, and so on. Then the rate of production
of any particular enzyme form Ei is k1ie1 + k2ie2 + · · · + knien,
where the sum includes every enzyme form except Ei itself;
and the rate of consumption of Ei is (ki1 + ki2 + · · · + kin)ei,
which we shall represent as ∑kijei. Then, the rate of change
of ei is
dei
dt = k1ie1 + k2ie2 + · · · + ki−1,iei−1 −∑kijei + ki,i+1ei+1
+ · · · + knien = 0
All of the terms are of the same type apart from the ith,
−∑kijei. In the steady state the expression is equal to zero,
and there are n expressions of the same type, one for each
of the n enzyme species.
However, only (n −1) of these
equations are independent, because any one of them can be
obtained by adding the other (n −1) together. To solve the
equations for the n unknowns, it is necessary to have one
further equation: this is provided by the condition that the
sum of concentrations of all the enzyme forms must be the
total enzyme concentration e0:
e1 + e2 + · · · + en = e0
(5.1)
In principle it does not matter which of the original n equa-
tions is replaced with equation 5.1, but in practice it is con-
venient when solving for em to choose the mth equation for
replacement. The complete set of n simultaneous equations is
then as follows:

These n simultaneous equations can in principle be solved
by any ordinary method. The determinant method known
as “Cramer’s rule” is extremely inefﬁcient as a numerical
method for solving any but the most trivial sets of simulta-
neous equations, but it remains valuable for expressing the
formal structure of the solution, and in this case it gives the
following expression for em:

in the mth column is zero apart from e0 in the mth row. This
element can be brought into the ﬁrst column of the ﬁrst row
by m switches of rows and m switches of columns, leaving
the rest of the determinant unchanged; 2m must be even,
regardless of whether m is odd or even, and so these switches
leave the sign and values of the determinant unchanged. As
the ﬁrst row now consists of zeros apart from e0 in the ﬁrst
column it follows that e0 can be taken out as a factor, leaving
a determinant of order (n −1). The normalized numerator

is (by deﬁnition) the alge-

that can be obtained by
taking one element from

element from each row, the
product of elements on the

example) being assigned a

according to whether the

satisfy yourself that switch-

following properties:
1. It contains no constants kmj with m as ﬁrst index. There-
fore, its expansion cannot anywhere contain a constant
kmj with m as ﬁrst index.
2. Every constant with the same ﬁrst index occurs in the
same column. As every product1 of rate constants in the
expansion must contain one element from each column,
it follows that no product can contain two or more con-
stants with the same ﬁrst index, and every index other
than m must occur once as ﬁrst index in every product.
3. Every constant kij, where i ̸= m and j ̸= m, occurs
twice in the determinant, once as a nondiagonal element
and once as one of the terms in a −∑kij summation.
Every product containing a cycle of indices, such as
k12k23k31, which contains the cycle 1 →2 →3 →1,
must therefore cancel out when the determinant is ex-
panded (notice than within any cycle each of a set of
indices occurs once as a ﬁrst index and once as a second
index).
To see why this should be so, it is simplest
to look at a speciﬁc example, such as k12k23k31. This
product will occur as −k12k23k31, from the multiplica-
tion (−k12)(−k23)(−k31), as a term in the expansion of
(−∑k1j)(−∑k2j)(−∑k3j), and also as +k12k23k31 from
the nondiagonal elements. Both of these products will
be multiplied by the same combinations of elements
from the rest of the determinant in the full expansion,
because whether one constructs k12k23k31 from diagonal
or from nondiagonal elements one uses the same rows
and columns, and therefore one leaves the same rows
and columns available for choosing elements for the rest
of the product.
1Although it should be obvious, it is perhaps useful to point out that
in this chapter the word product has its algebraic sense as the result of
multiplying two or more quantities together, not the chemical sense used in
the rest of the book. In contexts in this chapter where the chemical sense is
needed it will be written as reaction product.
5.2 The principle of the King–Altman method
111
We now need to consider the signs of these two sets
of products. If the number of rate constants in the cycle
is odd, as here, the product from the −∑kij summations
is negative, because it contains an odd number of neg-
ative elements from the main diagonal. However, the
product from the nondiagonal elements is positive, be-
cause it contains positive elements multiplied together,
which require an even number of column switches to
bring them to the main diagonal (switch columns 1
and 2, then columns 1 and 3, for the speciﬁc example
considered). Thus these products are of opposite sign
and cancel from the expansion.
On the other hand if the number of rate constants
in the cycle is even the situation is reversed: the prod-
uct from the diagonal elements is positive, because it
contains an even number of negative elements, whereas
the product from the nondiagonal elements is negative,
because an odd number of switches are needed to bring
these elements to the main diagonal.
Either way, all
products containing cycles cancel from the ﬁnal expan-
sion.
4. Any product containing a nondiagonal element must
contain at least one other nondiagonal element, because
selection of any nondiagonal element removes two diag-
onal elements from the choice of elements available for
the rest of the product (for example, if the third element
of the fourth row is used, both the third and fourth
diagonal elements are excluded by the requirement that
each product must contain one element only from each
row and one element only from each column). Then
selection of further nondiagonal elements can only be
terminated by selecting an element with a ﬁrst index
that is already used as second index and a second index
that is already used as ﬁrst index; in other words, a
cycle must be completed. However, we have seen that
all products that contain cycles must cancel out. Conse-
quently, all products that appear in the ﬁnal expansion
must be derived solely from diagonal elements. As all
of the constants in the diagonal are negative, it follows
that all of the products in the expansion must have the
same sign: positive if (n −1) is even; negative if (n −1)
is odd.
5. We have seen, under point (2), that every index except
m must occur at least once as ﬁrst index. Each product
112
5. Deriving Steady-state Rate Equations
contains (n −1) constants and so m must occur at least
once as a second index because, if it did not, every index
that occurred as a second index would also occur as a
ﬁrst index, and the product would inevitably contain at
least one cycle.
6. Every diagonal element −∑kij contains every possible
second index except i. Consequently, every product that
is not forbidden by the preceding rules must appear in
the ﬁnal expansion.
The conclusions from this discussion can be summarized
by saying that the expansion of the numerator of equation 5.2
contain a sum of products of (n −1) constants kij, of which
each has the following properties: (1) m does not occur as ﬁrst
index; (2) every other index occurs once only as ﬁrst index;
(3) there are no cycles of indices; (4) every product has the
same sign; (5) m occurs at least once as second index; (6) every
allowed product occurs.
Fortunately the denominator in equation 5.2 does not re-
quire discussion in such complicated detail: it has the same
value for every enzyme form and, because the total concen-
tration of all the enzyme forms must be e0 it must be the sum
of all the numerators, divided by e0:
D = N1 + N2 + · · · + Nn
Because of this, and because all numerators must have the
same sign, the denominator must have the same sign also,
so the fraction as a whole must be positive. This, of course,
merely conﬁrms the physical necessity that all concentrations
be positive. It has the convenient consequence that we do not
have to consider the signs of the numerators at all: whether
they are actually positive or negative they can be written as
positive.
To this point we have assumed that a reaction exists be-
tween every pair of enzyme forms. This is, of course, unreal-
istic, but it presents no problem, because any absent reaction
can be treated as a reaction with zero rate constants. Products
containing such constants must be zero and can be omitted.
Another objection to the above analysis is that two or more
parallel reactions may connect the same pair of enzyme forms.
In this case the total forward rate is the sum of the individual
forward rates, and the total reverse rate is the sum of the
individual reverse rates. So, in the above discussion, any kij
can be considered to be the sum of a number of constants for
5.3 The method of King and Altman
113
parallel reactions. Every product of rate constants discussed
in this section can be regarded as a “tree” or pathway leading
to one particular species from each of the other species. Con-
sequently the discussion leads naturally and automatically to
the method now to be described.
5.3
The method of King and Altman
The King–Altman method is most easily presented by refer-
ence to an example, and for this I shall take a mechanism
for a reaction with two substrates and two products (to be
considered again in Section 8.2):

closed scheme, with the central
complexes EAB and EPQ
collapsed into a single enzyme
form EX, and with all rate
constants written as ﬁrst-order
rate constants, for example, k1a,
not k1.
No rate constants are shown for the third reaction, because
steady-state measurements provide no information about iso-
merizations between intermediates that react only in ﬁrst-
order reactions2. We shall consider why this must be so in
Section 5.7.4, but for the moment it will just be stated without
§5.7.4, pages 125–126
§2.7.1, pages 54–58
proof. For analyzing the steady-state rate equation, therefore,
§2.7, pages 54–61
we must treat EAB and EPQ as a single species, even though
it may be mechanistically more meaningful to regard them as
distinct. Indeed, although chemical logic tells us that there
must be at least one chemical step (Section 2.7.1), and hence
at least two central complexes, steady-state kinetic measure-
ments cannot give any information about whether there may
be more than two.
For this reason, in the discussion that
follows EAB and EPQ will be collapsed into a single ternary
complex EX.
The ﬁrst step in the King–Altman method is to incorporate
the whole of the mechanism into a closed scheme that shows
all of the enzyme forms and the reactions between them, as in
Figure 5.1. All of the reactions must be treated as ﬁrst-order
reactions. This means that second-order reactions, such as the
2As a simple example that we have already discussed in Section 2.7,
consider the mechanisms shown as equations 2.27 and 2.30. Although they
are clearly different they lead to the same rate equation, equation 2.29, albeit
with different deﬁnitions of the parameters in terms of rate constants.

constants (Section 1.2.1); for example, the second-order rate

necessary to ﬁnd every pattern that
1. consists only of lines from the master pattern,
2. connects every pair of enzyme forms and
3. contains no closed loops.

Each pattern violates one of the
rules listed in the text for
deriving patterns from the
master pattern in Figure 5.2,
because (a) there is a line not in
the master pattern, (b) the lines
do not connect all enzyme
forms, or (c) there is a closed
loop.
Each pattern contains one line fewer than the number of en-
zyme forms and in this example there are four such patterns,
as shown in Figure 5.3. In this example the application of
these rules is fairly obvious, but in a more complex mecha-
nism it might not be, and to avoid any misunderstanding it
may be helpful to give three examples of improper patterns,
each of which satisﬁes two but violates one of the rules. These
are shown in Figure 5.4. For each enzyme form, arrowheads
are then imagined3 on the lines of the legitimate patterns, in
such a way that each pattern leads to the enzyme form consid-
ered regardless of where in the pattern one starts. For the free
enzyme E, the four patterns in Figure 5.3 would be imagined
as shown in Figure 5.5. Each pattern is then interpreted as

a product of the rate constants speciﬁed by the arrows with
reference to the complete mechanism in Figure 5.1, and the
whole set of four patterns is interpreted as the sum of four
such products. For example, the ﬁrst pattern in Figure 5.5
gives k−1k−2k−3p, and the complete set of patterns leading
to E represents (k−1k−2k−3p + k−1k−2k4 + k−1k3k4 + k2k3k4b).
This sum is then the numerator of an expression that repre-
sents the fraction of the total enzyme concentration e0 that
exists as E in the steady state:
[E]

= k−1k−2k−3p + k−1k−2k4 + k−1k3k4 + k2k3k4b

in which the denominator D will be deﬁned shortly. Proceed-
ing in exactly the same way for each of the other three enzyme

helpful to draw the arrowheads explicitly, as in Figure 5.5, it is not actually
necessary, because once one has a basic understanding of the method it is
obvious where the arrowheads should be and which rate constants they
correspond to.
5.3 The method of King and Altman

forms provides three more fractions as follows:
[EA]
e0
= k1k−2k−3ap + k1k−2k4a + k1k3k4a + k−2k−3k−4pq
D
(5.5)
[EX]
e0
= k1k2k−3abp + k1k2k4ab + k−1k−3k−4pq + k2k−3k−4bpq
D
[EQ]
e0
= k1k2k3ab + k−1k−2k−4q + k−1k3k−4q + k2k3k−4bq
D
(5.6)
As e0 = [E] + [EA] + [EX] + [EQ], because these are the
only four enzyme forms, it follows that the sum of the four
fractions must be 1, which means that the denominator D in
each fraction must be the sum of the numerators, the sum of
all 16 products obtained from the patterns. The rate of the
reaction is then the sum of the rates of the steps that generate
one particular reaction product, minus the sum of the rates
of the steps that consume the same reaction product. In this
example, there is one step only that generates P, EX →EQ + P,
and one step only that consumes P, EQ + P →EX, so

This looks complicated until we notice that six of the eight
numerator products occur twice each, once positive and once
negative, and so they cancel from the ﬁnal expression:
v = (k1k2k3k4e0ab −k−1k−2k−3k−4e0pq)/D
(5.8)
This completes the King–Altman method for deriving steady-
state rate equations.
For most purposes it is more important to know the form
of the steady-state rate equation than to know its detailed
expression in terms of rate constants.
It is often therefore
convenient to express a derived rate equation in coefﬁcient
form, which permits a straightforward prediction of the exper-
imental properties of a given mechanism. For the example we
have been examining, the coefﬁcient form of the rate equation

The method of Wong and Hanes
Although the King–Altman method avoids generating any
denominator terms that will subsequently be canceled by
subtraction, and thus avoids most of the wasted labor (and
mistakes) implied by the conceptually simpler approach, it
does not succeed in avoiding cancellation in the numerator of
the rate equation. In equation 5.7, for example, eight numera-
tor terms were initially written down, of which six were then
canceled by subtraction. It is striking that the two numerator
terms that survive have a rather tidy appearance compared
with the six that disappeared: the positive numerator term
consists of the product of the total enzyme concentration with
all substrate concentrations for the forward reaction and the
four rate constants for a complete forward cycle; the negative
numerator term consists of the product of the total enzyme
concentration with all substrate concentrations for the reverse
reaction and the four rate constants for a complete backward
cycle, as may be made clear by drawing the corresponding
arrow patterns in a sort of reverse King–Altman method, as
shown in Figure 5.6.

Wong and Hanes generalized this property into a struc-
tural rule for the numerator of the rate equation.
Initially
the master pattern is drawn, exactly as in the King–Altman
method (Figure 5.2). Next every pattern is drawn that
1. consists only of lines from the master pattern,
2. connects every pair of enzyme forms,
3. contains one arrow leaving every enzyme form, and
4. contains exactly one cycle capable of accomplishing a
complete reaction in either the forward or the reverse
direction.
In a simple mechanism such as the one considered already,
the cycle will consist of the entire master pattern.

Any steps outside the catalytic
cycle must be connected by
arrows leading into the cycle.
5.5 Modiﬁcations to the King–Altman method
117
However, in more complex cases there may be additional
enzyme forms outside the catalytic cycle: the lines connecting
these to the cycle must have arrow heads that lead into the
cycle (Figure 5.7). Finally the numerator terms are written as
an algebraic sum, such that every pattern accomplishing the
forward reaction gives a positive product and every pattern
accomplishing the reverse reaction gives a negative product.
If these rules are followed for the mechanism discussed in the
previous section they lead directly to equation 5.8 without the
need to write equation 5.7 ﬁrst and then cancel the unwanted
products.

small triangles accomplishes
the reaction A →P and has a

numerator. However, the large

One other complication needs to be mentioned: if the
cycle converts more than one stoichiometric equivalent it is
weighted accordingly. For example, the large outer triangle
in Figure 5.8 accomplishes the reaction 2A →2P and has a
stoichiometric factor of 2 in the rate equation.

Modiﬁcations to the King–Altman method
The King–Altman method as described is convenient and
easy to apply to any of the simpler enzyme mechanisms.
However, complex mechanisms often require large numbers
of patterns to be found.
The derivation is then laborious
and liable to mistakes, and one can easily overlook patterns
or write down incorrect terms. In principle it is possible to
calculate the total number of patterns, and indeed, King and
Altman suggested a method for doing this in their original pa-
per, and Chou and co-workers later described an easier one.

However, the calculations are tedious and error-prone unless
the mechanism is simple, because corrections are needed for
all the cycles in the mechanism. In any case, knowing how
many patterns are to be found hardly helps ﬁnding them, and
anyway does not decrease the labor involved in writing down
terms. For these reasons these calculations have been very
little applied.

steps.
In general it is better, for complex mechanisms, to search
for ways of simplifying the procedure. Volkenstein and Gold-
stein gave some rules for doing this, of which the simplest are
the following:
1. Parallel steps. If two or more steps interconvert the same
pair of enzyme forms, these steps can be condensed into
one by adding the rate constants for the parallel reac-
tions. For example, the Michaelis–Menten mechanism
is represented in the King–Altman method as shown

at the left of Figure 5.9, which gives the two patterns
shown at the center. Because the two reactions connect
the same pair of enzyme forms, they can be added to
give the scheme shown at the right. The resulting mas-
ter pattern is itself the only pattern, so the expressions
for [E] and [EA] can be written down immediately:

Figure 5.10. Taking account of
symmetry. The mechanism
shown at the top is symmetrical
about the broken line, so it can
be written with stoichiometric
coefﬁcients to give the simpler
diagram shown in the middle,
and as this contains parallel
steps it can be simpliﬁed further
as in Figure 5.9 to give the
mechanism shown at the
bottom.
2. Symmetry. If the mechanism contains different enzyme
species that have identical properties, the procedure is
greatly simpliﬁed by treating them as single species. For
example, if an enzyme contained two identical active
sites, the mechanism might be represented as shown at
the top of Figure 5.10. Treated in this way the mech-
anism requires 32 patterns, but if one takes advantage
of the symmetry about the broken line to write it as
shown in the middle of the ﬁgure it simpliﬁes to one of
only four patterns, which the addition of parallel steps
(rule 1) allows to be simpliﬁed still further, as shown
at the bottom. As this generates only one pattern, the
expressions for the concentrations can be written down
immediately:
[E]
e0
=
2(k−1 + k2)(k−3 + k4)
2(k−1 + k2)(k−3 + k4) + 4k1(k−3 + k4)a + 2k1k3a2
and so on.
Statistical factors always appear whenever advan-
tage is taken in this way of symmetry in the master
pattern.
In this example there are two ways for the
reaction E →EA to occur, and so the total rate is the
sum of the two rates, giving a rate constant 2k1a that is
twice the rate constant for either of the two paths on its
own. The reverse reaction EA →A, on the other hand,
can only occur in one way, with a statistical factor of 1,
so its rate constant remains k−1.

case of competitive substrates discussed earlier in Sec-
tion 2.4 (Figure 5.11), in which a single enzyme simulta-
§2.4, pages 38–43
neously catalyzes two separate reactions with different
substrates. In this case, the expression for each enzyme
form is the product of the appropriate sums for the left
and right halves of the master pattern.

(k−1k−2 + k−1k3 + k2k3)/D

The numerator is the product of two sums: the ﬁrst
comes from the patterns that lead to E in the left half
of the master pattern, and may be deﬁned as
F ′ = k′
−1k′
−2 + k′
−1k′

It appears unchanged in the numerators for EA and EP.
The second comes from the patterns that lead to E in the
right half of the master pattern, and may be deﬁned as
F = k−1k−2 + k−1k3 + k2k3
It appears unchanged in the numerators for EA′ and
EP′. So the remaining enzyme forms have the following
concentrations:
[EA]

= F ′(k1k−2a + k1k3a + k−2k−3p)/D

complicated rate equations. In such cases, some simpliﬁca-

course, turn out on further investigation to be false, but they

Figure 5.12. Treatment of steps
at equilibrium. If the protona-
tion steps (vertical in the exam-
ple) are treated as equilibria, the
mechanism can be simpliﬁed by
treating group of enzyme forms
at equilibrium as a single
species.
Cha described a method for analyzing mechanisms that
contain steps at equilibrium that is much simpler than the
full King–Altman analysis because each group of enzyme
forms at equilibrium can be treated as a single species. As
an example, consider the mechanism shown in Figure 5.12,
for an enzyme in which the unprotonated enzyme E0 and the
protonated form HE+ are both catalytically active but with
different kinetic constants4. If equilibrium between E0 and
HE+ is maintained in the steady state, E0 and HE+ form frac-
tions KE/(KE + h) and h/(KE + h) respectively of the compos-
ite species E, where the hydrogen-ion concentration is written
as h. The rate of binding of A to E0 is k1[E0]a and can thus be
written as k1[E]aKE/(KE + h); that of A to HE+ can similarly
be written as k′
1[E]ah/(KE + h), and the total rate of binding
of A to the composite species E is [E]a(k1KE + k′
1h)/(KE + h).
In effect, the individual rate constants k1 and k′
1 have been
replaced by a composite rate constant (k1KE + k′
1h)/(KE + h)
for the composite species: more generally, this composite rate
constant is the sum of the individual rate constants weighted
according to the fraction of the relevant enzyme form in the
equilibrium mixture. The release of A from the composite
species EA and the conversion of the same species to products
can be dealt with in the same way.
All of this may seem to be making the analysis more com-
plicated rather than simpler. However, what has happened
is that the original mechanism that would require the King–
Altman method to analyze has been replaced by a mechanism
for which the solution is already known: in effect it is the
Michaelis–Menten mechanism, albeit with unusually compli-
cated expressions for the component rate constants. The rate
equation can thus be written down immediately, replacing k1
in equation 2.10 by (k1KE + k′
1h)/(KE + h), and similarly for
k−1 and k2.
Chapter 10, pages 253–271
4In the usual treatment of the pH behavior of enzymes, discussed in
Chapter 10, one assumes that only one protonation state is catalytically active,
but here we shall assume that both EA0 and HEA+ can react to give products
as otherwise the example is too trivial to serve as an illustration of Cha’s
method.
5.6 Reactions containing steps at equilibrium
121
Cha’s method is applicable to any mechanism that con-
tains steps at equilibrium. In general any number of enzyme
forms in equilibrium with one another can be treated as one
species, and each rate constant ki for a component becomes a
term ki fi in the summation for the rate constant of the com-
posite species, where fi is the fraction of the component in the
equilibrium mixture. Although Segel and Martin questioned

the general validity of the method, Topham and Brocklehurst
have shown that it is valid5.
Their analysis has more than a passing interest, because, as
they point out, other authors have made similar errors and it
is important to understand how to avoid them. The essential
point is that whenever a pathway contains cycles one must
take account of all of the parallel routes that connect any pair
of species in the mechanism. More generally, whatever rate
constants are assumed for any of the steps in a mechanism,
it is essential that the product of all the ratios of forward and
reverse rate constants for the steps connecting a pair of species
must be the equilibrium constant for the net process. It ought

to be superﬂuous to add that this equilibrium constant must
be the same for every parallel route that accomplishes the
same reaction. It follows that a cycle that accomplishes no net
change, such as the cycle E0 →HE+ →HEA+ →EA0 →E0
in Figure 5.12, must have a net equilibrium constant of 1.
This important principle is known as the principle of mi-
croscopic reversibility or the principle of detailed balance.
The
two names are almost equivalent but microscopic reversibility
emphasizes that a reaction proceeding in the reverse direc-
tion follows the same mechanism as it does in the forward
direction, whereas detailed balance emphasizes that when an
entire process is at equilibrium all of its component steps
are at equilibrium as well.
Occasionally there have been
deliberate challenges to the principle by authors well aware
of its existence, for example in Weber and Anderson’s work
mentioned later (Section 12.7.3), but far more often it is vio-

had given an incorrect account of the errors in Segel and Martin’s work, but
their arguments included several mistakes, as detailed by Selwyn and by
Brocklehurst and Topham, and the numerical calculations offered in support
of them failed to take account of the need for the product of ratios of rate
constants around a cycle to agree with the equilibrium constant for the cycle.
All of this underlines the point that proper analysis of rate equations cannot
be done without proper care, and that incorrect ideas are widespread in the
literature.

erroneous ideas about how kinetic cooperativity could arise
in monomeric enzymes before the valid models described in
Section 12.9 were developed.
§12.9, pages 320–323
A word of warning should be given about the use of
Cha’s method in relation to mechanisms that contain parallel
binding pathways, such as a mechanism in which two sub-
strates A and B can bind in either order to arrive at the same
ternary complex EAB. Because the full rate equation for such
a mechanism is often too complicated to be manageable, it
is common practice to use equations derived on the assump-
tion that binding steps are at equilibrium. Mechanistically,
there is no more basis for making any such assumption than
there is for a one-substrate reaction (Section 2.3.1), yet the
§2.3.1, pages 32–33
resulting equations are often found to be in good agreement
with experiment. The problem is that the additional terms
present in the rigorous steady-state rate equation may be nu-
merically negligible, or they may vary so nearly in proportion
with other terms that they are almost impossible to detect,
as discussed by Gulbinsky and Cleland in relation to a study

of galactokinase. This is an instance of an important general
point for the correct application of kinetics: more than one
set of assumptions can lead to the same rate equation, or to a
family of rate equations that are experimentally indistinguish-
able; one cannot use experimental adherence to a particular
rate equation as proof that the assumptions used to derive the
equation were correct. This is the principle of homeomorphism
that arose in the context of a simpler example in Problem 2.2.

One might think—indeed, it seems too obvious to be worth
saying—that the main role of the King–Altman method in
modern enzymology was for deriving rate equations. How-
ever, this would be a mistake, because outside the context
of teaching one rarely has occasion to derive rate equa-
tions, and many of those of greatest importance are known
already:
many examples, both of rate equations and of
their derivation, may be found in the books of Plowman,
Segel and Schulz. The real importance of the King–Altman
method is that once one is thoroughly conversant with it
one can understand where every term in a rate equation
comes from (Figure 5.13), and one can deduce important con-
clusions about the steady-state properties of enzyme mech-

cess Wong aptly called topological reasoning.
In the King–
Altman method every pattern generates a positive term, and
every term appears in the denominator of the rate equation.
As there are no negative terms, no terms can cancel by sub-
traction, and so every term for which a pattern exists must
appear in the rate equation. The only exception to this rule
is that sometimes the numerator and denominator share a
common factor that can be canceled by division, but this can
only occur if there are symmetries in the mechanism such that
certain rate constants appear more than once.
5.7.2
Mechanisms with alternative routes
In mechanisms with no relationships between rate constants
apart from those required by thermodynamics, it is usually
safe to assume that no cancellation between numerator and
denominator will be possible, and that any term for which
a pattern exists must appear in the rate equation. Consider,

The mechanism is the same as

for example, the mechanism shown in Figure 5.14, which is
the same as the one in Figure 5.12 without the assumption
that the protonation steps are at equilibrium: is there any
conclusion we can draw about how the rate equation will
differ from the one obtained with the equilibrium assump-
tion, without actually deriving it? If no equilibrium steps are

5. Deriving Steady-state Rate Equations
assumed, the King–Altman method must produce terms in
a2 and h2, because one can easily ﬁnd patterns that contain
two A-binding steps or two H+-binding steps, for example,
the pattern terminating at EA0 consisting of E0 →EA0 and
HE+ →HEA+ →EA0 (shown in bold in the ﬁgure). Thus
simply by inspecting the mechanism one can deduce that the
rate equation is second-order in a and in h. Note that this can
be done without writing anything on paper, neither drawing
patterns nor doing any algebra (though the process would
perhaps be made a little easier by redrawing the mechanism
in a closed form, as in Figure 5.1, so that E0 and HE+ do not
each appear twice).
5.7.3
Dead-end steps
Apart from the value of inspection for studying particular
mechanisms, it can be used to arrive at important and far-
reaching conclusions about mechanisms in general. Consider,
for example, the effect of adding a step to the mechanism
of Figure 5.1, in which an inhibitor I is an analog of B that

is sufﬁciently similar to B to bind in the same way, but not
sufﬁciently similar to undergo reaction, binds to EA to form
a dead-end complex EAI that is incapable of any reaction
apart from release of I to re-form EA, as shown in Figure 5.15,
which can be regarded as a more explicit version of Figure
5.7. For every enzyme form of the original mechanism, that
is to say every enzyme form apart from EAI, every King–
Altman pattern must contain the reaction EAI →EA, and
so every enzyme form apart from EAI must have the same
expression as before apart from being multiplied by k−5. As
the only route to EAI is through EA, it is obvious that every
pattern for EAI must be the same as a pattern for EA with the
reaction EAI →EA replaced by EA →EAI, so the expression
for EAI must be the same as that for EA with k−5 replaced by
k5i, that is to say the ratio [EAI]/[EA] must be k5i/k−5. As
k5/k−5 is the equilibrium association constant this means that
the step must be at equilibrium in the steady state. The rate
equation as a whole must be the same as for the mechanism
without dead-end inhibition except that all terms for EA in
the denominator are multiplied by (1 + k5i/k−5).
A little reﬂection will show that this conclusion is not par-
ticular to the mechanism considered, but applies to any mech-
anism with dead-end steps, even if these form a series, that
is to say even if several steps are needed to connect a dead-
end complex to the rest of the mechanism: in any mechanism,
5.7 Analyzing mechanisms by inspection
125
dead-end reactions are at equilibrium in the steady state.
One can understand in mechanistic terms (without algebra)
why this conclusion applies by realizing that the reason why
ordinary steady-state reactions are not at equilibrium is that
ﬂux of reactants through a reaction is a process of continual
unbalancing: constant replenishment of reactants on one side
and removal of products from the other. However, there is no
net ﬂux of reactants through a dead-end reaction, and no cor-
responding unbalancing to interfere with the establishment of
equilibrium.

complexes shown as separate

son with Figure 5.1 the rate
constants common to both
versions are not renumbered,
and the additional rate con-

Regardless of the complexity of the mechanism, and regard-
less of how many central complexes there are, we can con-
sider the King-Altman patterns leading into a sequence

there must be a set of patterns terminating at EAB. Each of
these will be associated with some combination of reactant
concentrations. However, exactly the same set of patterns will
exist terminating at EX: those coming via EAB will have the
same product of rate constants, with the same concentrations
associated, multiplied by the rate constant for EAB →EX, the
others being multiplied instead by the rate constant for EX →
EAB.
As a speciﬁc example, Figure 5.16 illustrates the same
mechanism as Figure 5.1, with the difference that now EAB
and EPQ are shown as distinct complexes, with rate constant
k0 for the reaction EAB →EPQ and k−0 for the reaction
EPQ →EAB. At the right is shown a pattern terminating at
EAB, corresponding to the product k−0k1k2k4ab, and below
it the same pattern terminating at EPQ and corresponding
to the product k0k1k2k4ab.
These contain exactly the same
combination ab of concentrations, and differ only by the ratio
k0/k−0. A little reﬂection should show that exactly the same
ratio must apply to each of the ﬁve patterns terminating at
EPQ when compared with those terminating at EAB. As there
is no way to perturb this ratio there is no way to use steady-
state methods to determine anything about its magnitude.

Worse than that, there is no way to assess even how many

be generalized to mechanisms of any complexity.
5.8
A simpler method for irreversible reactions
As noted in Section 2.2, Van Slyke and Cullen many years
§2.2, pages 28–31
D. D. Van Slyke and G. E.
Cullen (1914) “The mode of
action of urease and of enzymes
in general” Journal of Biological
Chemistry 19, 141–180
ago interpreted the time to complete a catalytic cycle as the
sum of the times required for the individual steps.
That
interpretation is valid in general for sequences of irreversible
steps (as they assumed the simple two-step mechanism to be),
but it is too simple for most systems of interest in enzymology,
in which there is nearly always at least one reversible step.
However, Waley pointed out that it can be extended without

method for deriving steady-
state rate equations” Biochemical
Journal 286 357–359
great difﬁculty to any mechanism in which at least one oblig-
atory step is irreversible, and is thus applicable to most of the
important cases.
Quite apart for its practical usefulness for deriving rate
equations, Waley’s method is valuable for understanding the
structure of a rate equation, and can be regarded as an ex-
tension to the preceding section. For that reason I shall ﬁrst
examine the solution for a particular mechanism and then see
how this can be formalized as a method. Figure 5.17 shows
the reciprocal form of the rate equation used in Section 5.3 to
§5.3, pages 113–116
illustrate the method of King and Altman, with both product
concentrations set to zero, p = q = 0, thereby making both
product-release steps irreversible. As it is an expression for
e0/v it has dimensions of time and can be understood as the
sum of times required for the four steps in the reaction. It is
easiest to understand if read from right to left, so we consider
5.8 Simpler method for irreversible reactions
127
the terms 1/k4 and 1/k3 ﬁrst. These are the times required
for the fourth and third steps, and are not subject to any
complication.
The term for step 2 is less simple, because the uncorrected
time 1/k2b needs to be multiplied by a factor 1 + k−2/k3,
because only a fraction k3/(k−2 + k3) of the molecules that
reach EAB continue to produce EQ, because another fraction
k−2/(k−2 + k3) returning instead to EA. 6 So the average time
needed for step 2 must be increased by the factor 1 + k−2/k3
shown in the ﬁgure. The term for step 1 is further complicated
by the fact that not all the molecules that arrive at EA continue
to form EAB, but the principle is the same, and the complete
rate equation is as shown.
Now let us consider how to derive this equation from the
mechanism. Again, it is simplest to proceed from right to left7.
There are four expressions for the same rate v:
v = k4[EQ]
(5.10)
v = k3[EAB]
(5.11)
v = k2b[EA] −k−2[EAB]
(5.12)
v = k1[E][A] −k−1[EA]
(5.13)
Equations 5.10–5.11 provide expressions for [EQ]/v and
[EAB]/v immediately:
τ4 = [EQ]
v
= 1
k4
;
τ3 = [EAB]
v

and the second of these can be used to solve equation 5.12
after eliminating [EAB]:

directional rate such as the one symbolized in Figure 5.17 as F(EAB →EA),
but we shall not need this term here.
7More generally, as the last step will not necessarily be irreversible, one
should start from an irreversible step and proceed in the opposite direction
from that indicated by the arrow.

Altman patterns (omitting ones with zero values), as in Figure
5.18, it become evident that the matrix is already triangular,
and so provided the equations are solved in the right order
the solution can just be written down.
This explains why
the method is simpler (though less general) than the King–
Altman method. Cleland’s net rate constant method is quite

analysis and the concept of net

similar to the method described here, as it depends on the
same principles and is also restricted to mechanisms with an
irreversible step.
5.9
Derivation of rate equations by computer
The derivation of a rate equation, whether by the method of
King and Altman or in any other way, is a purely mechanical
process, and success or failure depends on the avoidance of
mistakes rather than on making correct intellectual decisions
about how to proceed at any point. As such it is ideal for
computer implementation, and computer programs for de-
riving rate equations were described by Hurst and later by
numerous other authors.
All of these older programs are

approach to the use of deter-
minants in the calculation of the
rate equation for a complex en-
zyme system” Canadian Journal
of Biochemistry 45, 2015–2039

effectively obsolete, as they were written in languages such
as Fortran that are no longer widely used in biochemical
research, and designed to run on obsolete computer systems.
They have been reviewed recently by Qi and colleagues, who
have, more important, designed a program suitable for use on
modern systems.8
To implement the method of King and Altman in the
computer, it is convenient to regard the derivation as a series
of operations on a table of rate constants rather than as the
algebraic equivalent of an exercise in pattern recognition, be-
cause interpretation of geometric relationships is difﬁcult to
implement in the computer.

ered in Section 5.3, that of Figure 5.1, repeated here as Figure

5.19, and to obtain a valid product of rate constants terminat-
ing at E we can take the ﬁrst available rate constant from each
row except the ﬁrst, giving k−1k−2k4: omission of the E→row
ensures that the product has no step leading away from E, and
including every other row ensures that there is exactly one
step leading out of every other intermediate. However, this
is only the ﬁrst of the possible products. To obtain the others,
we replace the rate constant from the EQ→row by each other
possibility from that row, giving k−1k−2k−3p as the only new
product. We then move to the second position of the previous
row, the EX→row, and again choose all possibilities from the
EQ→row, giving k−1k3k4 and k−1k3k−3p. If there were other
possibilities in the EX→row we would do the same for them,
but there are not, so we proceed to the next element of the
EA→row, taking all possibilities in turn from the EX→and
EQ→rows.
In total eight products can be generated in this way, as
listed in Table 5.2. However, not all of these are valid, because
some do not contain a step to E, and some are cyclic. In prin-
ciple it is not necessary to check whether a product contains
a step to the target species, because any noncyclic product
130
5. Deriving Steady-state Rate Equations
must satisfy this requirement. However, it is much easier to
check if a product contains a step to E than it is to check if it is
cyclic, because a product that leads to E must contain at least
one rate constant from the →E column. It is best therefore to
delete products that do not contain a rate constant from the
→E column before checking if any of the others are cyclic.
In Table 5.2 it is trivially easy to recognize cyclic products,
because the only kind of cycle possible with this mechanism
is one in which both forward and reverse rate constants from
the same step occur, as in k−1k3k−3p, which contains both the
forward and reverse rate constants of step 3. More complex
cycles can occur in more complicated mechanisms, however,
and a valid program must be able to recognize these.
Conceptually the simplest (though not the most efﬁcient)
way of determining if a product is cyclic is to start from each
rate constant in turn that it contains and follow through at
most n −1 steps until the target species is found. For example,
consider k2bk−2k4, and start with k2b: this comes from the
→EX column, and so we have to ﬁnd the rate constant from
the EX→row, which is k3; this is from the →EQ column so we
look for the entry from the EQ→row, which is k4; this is in the
→E column, so the process is terminated successfully in three
steps (3 = n −1 in this example). As the other two elements
in this product were checked during the course of checking
k2b they do not need to be checked again. However, if we had
started with k3 the check would not have passed through k2b
and so it would have had to be checked separately.
This method of checking for cyclic products may seem
tedious, but one should be careful not to be seduced by ap-
pealing shortcuts that may not always give correct results. For
example, for many mechanisms any product that contains the
same rate constant more than once, or contains the forward
and reverse versions of the same rate constant, will be cyclic.
However, one cannot assume that this will always be true,
because certain kinds of symmetry in the enzyme mechanism
can result in having one or more rate constants appearing
more than once, as for example in Figure 5.12. Some of the
published methods for analyzing mechanisms by computer
(not among those cited above) have failed to include the
necessary precautions and consequently give incorrect results
for such mechanisms.
After eliminating the invalid products the sum of the oth-
ers gives the expression for [E]/e0, as in equation 5.4:
5.9
131
[E]
e0
= k−1k−2k4 + k−1k−2k−3p + k−1k3k4 + k2bk3k4
D
Conversion of this to equation 5.5, that is to say the corre-
sponding expression for [EA]/e0, now requires analysis of
each product in the sum to identify the pathway from EA to E
that it contains, reversing the rate constants for this part of the
product and leaving the rest unchanged. For k−1k−2k4, for ex-
ample, the pathway from EA to E consists of just k−1, so when
it is reversed it is replaced by k1a, whereas k−2k4 is left un-
changed and the whole product becomes k k1ak−2k4. Doing
this for each product in turn, and then for EX and EQ in the
same way, provides equations equivalent to equations 5.5–5.6.
This then provides the basis for a computer equivalent of the
method of King and Altman. The numerator can be dealt with
by applying the same sort of logic to the rules of Wong and
Hanes (Section 5.4), and hence it is straightforward to obtain
§5.4, pages 116–117
the complete rate equation.
Summary of Chapter 5
• In principle any steady-state rate can be derived by the method
§5.1, pages 107–108
used for deriving the Michaelis–Menten equation, but this
can be very tedious and error-prone on account of the many
terms that need to be derived but which cancel from the ﬁnal
result.
• The method of King and Altman avoids many of the prob-
§§5.3–5.5, pages 113–119
lems and derives terms of the rate equation from a graphic
representation of the mechanism.
• The method of King and Altman still produces terms in the
§5.4, pages 116–117
numerator of the rate expression that need to be canceled,
but the structural rule of Wong and Hanes avoids this
problem.
• Steps at equilibrium can be handled more simply by treating
§5.6, pages 119–122
each set of species at equilibrium as a single species.
• A good understanding of the method of King and Altman
§5.7, pages 122–126
allows important features of a rate equation to be deduced by
inspection of the mechanism, without an actual derivation.
• The full version of the method of King and Altman is appro-
§5.8, pages 126–128
priate for reversible reactions, but simpler methods exist for
irreversible reactions.

Solutions and notes are on pages 462–463.
5.1 In the opening sentence of this chapter the second step
in deriving a rate equation was deﬁned as writing down
“expressions for the rates of change of all but one of the
enzyme forms.” Why “all but one”? Why are not all the
enzyme forms concerned?
5.2 Derive a rate equation for the following mechanism:
E + A ⇋EA ⇋E′P ⇋E′ + P
E′ + B ⇋E′B ⇋EQ ⇋E + Q
treating EA and E′P as a single enzyme form, and E′B and
EQ as a single enzyme form. Ignoring terms containing
the product concentrations p and q, how does the coefﬁ-
cient form of the rate equation differ from equation 5.9,
for the mechanism of equation 5.3?
5.3 Without carrying out a complete derivation, write down
a rate equation for the mechanism of Problem 5.2 in the
case where B can bind to E to give a dead-end complex
EB with a dissociation constant KsiB.
5.4 Consider an enzyme that catalyzes two reactions simulta-
neously, interconversion of A + B with P + Q and of A + B′
with P′ + Q, that is to say A and Q are common to the two
reactions but B, B′, P and P′ are not. Assuming that both
reactions proceed individually by the mechanism shown
in equation 5.3, draw a master pattern for the system and
ﬁnd all valid King–Altman patterns. In this system the
rate equation for v deﬁned as dp/dt is not the same as
that for v deﬁned as −da/dt. Why not?
5.5 Show that for all mechanisms that contain at least two
enzyme forms that do not react in unimolecular reactions
every term in the rate equation contains at least one reac-
tant concentration. (Problem 5.2 provides an example of
such a mechanism).

6.1
Introduction
Substances that decrease the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction when present in the reaction mixture are called in-
hibitors. Inhibition can arise in a wide variety of ways, how-
ever, and there are many different types of inhibitor. This
chapter deals with reversible inhibitors, substances that form
dynamic complexes with the enzyme that are less effective as
catalysts than the uncombined enzyme. Inhibition can also be
irreversible, and Chapter 7 deals with this. Enzyme inhibition
Chapter 7, pages 169–188
has long been valuable for shedding light on the mechanisms
of catalysis, but it has acquired an enormous practical im-
portance as the basis of drug design, much of which can be
characterized as the search for speciﬁc inhibitors. This applies
particularly to tight-binding inhibitors, and will accordingly
be discussed at the end of Chapter 7.
If an enzyme has no catalytic activity at all when saturated
with inhibitor the inhibition may be described as complete
inhibition, but is more often referred to as linear inhibition, in
reference to the linear dependence of the apparent values of
Km/V and 1/V on the inhibitor concentration, or just simple
inhibition. Objections can be raised to all of these terms, the
ﬁrst being likely to be misunderstood if used out of context,
and the third because it is too vague. If “linear” is taken to

6. Reversible Inhibition and Activation
mean that plots of the apparent values of Km/V and 1/V
against the inhibitor concentration are straight this may not
be very helpful, as these plots are less used today than they
once were. However, linearity is a mathematical concept that
is deﬁned without any reference to graphs, and in this book
the term linear inhibition will be used.
Less often considered (though probably not as rare in na-
ture as is usually assumed) is inhibition in which the enzyme–
inhibitor complex has some residual catalytic activity: this
is called hyperbolic inhibition, from the shapes of the curves
obtained by plotting apparent Michaelis–Menten parameters
against inhibitor concentration, or partial inhibition, from the
survival of some activity when the enzyme is saturated with
inhibitor (see Section 6.7.4).
§6.7.4, pages 155–157
Both linear and hyperbolic inhibition may in principle be
subclassiﬁed according to the particular apparent Michaelis–
Menten parameters they affect, but in practice the common
terms always imply linear inhibition unless otherwise stated.
The commonest type is usually called competitive inhibition,
and is characterized by a decrease in the apparent Km/V with
no change in the apparent V. Because competitive inhibition
was known before it was realized that V and V/Km are the
fundamental parameters of the Michaelis–Menten equation,
the behavior is often described as an increase in Km. How-
ever, as will be clear later (see Table 6.1) the classiﬁcation
of inhibitors is much simpler and more straightforward if
expressed in terms of effects on V and V/Km.
The type of inhibition at the opposite extreme from com-
petitive inhibition is uncompetitive inhibition: here apparent
V is decreased, with apparent V/Km unchanged, and it can
also be expressed by saying that apparent V and Km are both
decreased by the same factor. Spanning the range between
these two is mixed inhibition, in which apparent V and V/Km
are both decreased.
Another type, known as pure noncom-
petitive inhibition (apparent V decreased, with apparent Km
unchanged), was once thought to be equally important, but
it is actually quite rare. All of these will now be described.

respects malonate has almost the same structure as succinate,
and not surprisingly it can bind to the substrate-binding site
of succinate dehydrogenase to give an abortive complex that
is incapable of reacting.
This is an example of competitive
inhibition, so-called because the substrate and the inhibitor
compete for the same site.

occur, and the inhibition constant is an equilibrium constant
because of the particular mechanism assumed, not because
the inhibition is competitive: inhibition can be competitive
without requiring the inhibition constant to be an equilibrium
constant. In many of the more complex types of inhibition,
including most types of product inhibition (Figure 6.3), the
inhibition constant is not a true equilibrium constant because
the enzyme–inhibitor complex is not a dead-end complex.

deﬁne the effects of competitive inhibition regardless of the
underlying mechanism, and as they show that the essential
effect of a competitive inhibitor is to decrease the apparent
speciﬁcity constant, it would appear that the name speciﬁc
inhibition would be preferable. In contexts where activation
(Section 6.7) is also being considered, this would be a major
§6.7, pages 152–157
improvement, but for general use it is quite unrealistic to
suppose that biochemists will abandon a name sanctioned
by a century of use in order to avoid confusion when the
much less important phenomenon of speciﬁc activation is
under discussion. For this reason I continue to use the term
competitive inhibition in this book, though I emphasize that it is
deﬁned operationally,1 not mechanistically, in accordance with
the recommendations on kinetic terminology made by the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the

6.2.2
Mixed inhibition
Most elementary accounts of inhibition discuss two types
only, competitive inhibition and noncompetitive inhibition. Com-
petitive inhibition is of genuine importance in nature, but
noncompetitive inhibition is a phenomenon found mainly
in textbooks and it need not be considered in detail here.
It arose originally because Michaelis and his collaborators,
L. Michaelis and P. Rona (1914)

der Maltase aus Bierhefe. III.

denartigen Hemmungen der
Fermentwirkungen” Bio-

(1914) “Über die verschieden-
artige Natur der Hemmungen

chemische Zeitschrift 60, 79–90
who were the ﬁrst to study enzyme inhibition, assumed that
certain kinds of inhibitor acted by decreasing the apparent
value of V with no corresponding effect on that of Km, as
illustrated in Figure 6.5. Such an effect seemed at the time to
be the obvious alternative to competitive inhibition, and was
termed “noncompetitive inhibition”. It is difﬁcult to imagine
a reasonable explanation for such behavior, however: one
would have to suppose that the inhibitor interfered with the
catalytic properties of the enzyme but that it had no effect
1An operational deﬁnition is one that expresses what is observed, without
regard to how it may be interpreted, whereas a mechanistic deﬁnition implies
an interpretation. Mechanistic deﬁnitions of kinetic behavior are frequently
used, but they have the disadvantage that observations cannot be described
until they have been interpreted, even though in research it is often necessary
to describe observations before there is a satisfactory explanation of them.

on the binding of substrate; expressed somewhat differently,
it would mean that two molecules (the free enzyme and the
enzyme–substrate complex) with quite different properties in
other respects had equal binding constants for the inhibitor.
This is possible for very small inhibitors, such as protons,
metal ions and small anions such as Cl−, but is unlikely
otherwise.

inhibition is best regarded as a
special case of mixed inhibition
(Figure 6.6).
Noncompetitive inhibition by protons is, in fact, common.
There are also several instances of noncompetitive inhibition
by heavy-metal ions, though some (maybe all) of these are
really examples of partial irreversible inactivation, which will
be discussed shortly.
Noncompetitive inhibition by other
species is rare, and most of the commonly quoted examples,
such as the inhibition of β-fructofuranosidase (“invertase”)
by α-glucose described by Nelson and Anderson and the

data, to be examples of mixed inhibition, or else they result
from confusion between reversible noncompetitive inhibition
and partial irreversible inactivation.
In general, it is best to
regard noncompetitive inhibition as a special, and not very
interesting, case of mixed inhibition.
In partial irreversible inactivation it does not affect what is
observed whether the primary effect of the inactivation is on
V, V/Km or Km, because whichever it is the net result is a loss
of enzyme molecules from the system, with the unaffected
molecules behaving just as before. However, as V = kcate0 is
the product of the catalytic constant kcat and the concentration
of active enzyme e0, it will decrease regardless of whether the
apparent value of kcat is decreased (genuine noncompetitive
inhibition), or whether e0 is decreased (irreversible inactiva-
tion).

6. Reversible Inhibition and Activation
The simplest formal mechanism for this behavior is one in
which the inhibitor can bind both to the free enzyme to give
a complex EI with dissociation constant Kic, and also to the
enzyme–substrate complex to give a complex EAI with dis-
sociation constant Kiu, as shown in Figure 6.7.

EAI both exist in this scheme there is no obvious mechanistic
reason why A should not bind directly to EI to give EAI,
as shown, so the inhibitor-binding steps are not dead-end
reactions and it does not therefore follow automatically that
they must be at equilibrium (Section 5.7.3).
§5.7.3, pages 124–125
The complete steady-state rate equation is thus more com-
plicated than equation 6.2 with the deﬁnitions given in equa-
tions 6.6–6.8: it includes terms in a2 and i2 that do not cancel
unless all of the binding reactions are in equilibrium. How-
ever, the predicted deviations from linear kinetics are difﬁcult
to detect experimentally, and so adherence to linear kinetics
is not adequate evidence that Km, Kic and Kiu are true equilib-
rium dissociation constants. In practice inhibitor binding is
generally treated as an equilibrium nonetheless, but it should
be understood that that is an assumption that does not follow
directly from the mechanism: in this respect mixed inhibi-
tion differs from competitive inhibition (Section 6.2.1) and
§6.2.1, pages 134–136
uncompetitive inhibition (considered in the next section), for
which binding of the inhibitor at equilibrium is a necessary
consequence of the way the mechanism is written.
Although it is formally convenient to deﬁne mixed in-
hibition in terms of Figure 6.7, it occurs mainly as an im-
portant case of product inhibition. If a product is released
in a step that generates an enzyme form other than the one
to which the substrate binds, product inhibition is predicted
to be in accordance with equations 6.6–6.8. This conclusion
does not depend on any equilibrium assumptions, being a
necessary consequence of the steady-state treatment, as can
readily be shown by the methods of Chapter 5. The simplest
Chapter 5, pages 107–132
Chapter 8, pages 189–226
of many mechanisms of this type is one in which the product
is released in the second of three steps, as shown in Figure
6.8. More complex examples abound in reactions that involve

more than one substrate or product, as will be seen in Chapter
8. In these cases, identiﬁcation of Kic and Kiu with dissociation
constants is not very useful. Even in such a simple example
as Figure 6.7, in which the product P acts as a mixed inhibitor
rather than as a competitive inhibitor because it binds to a
different form of enzyme from A, the inhibition constants are
Kic = (k−1 + k2)k3/k−1k−2 and Kiu = (k2 + k3)/k−2, and
neither of them is an equilibrium constant except in special
cases, such as k3 ≪k2.
6.2 Linear inhibition
139
As genuine noncompetitive inhibition is rare there has
been a tendency to generalize the term to embrace mixed
inhibition.
There seems to be no advantage in doing this:
apart from anything else it replaces a short unambiguous
word with a longer ambiguous one, thereby adding to the
confusion of an already confused nomenclature.
To avoid
the ambiguity one must refer to noncompetitive inhibition
in the classical sense as pure noncompetitive inhibition or true
noncompetitive inhibition.

The uncompetitive inhibition constant Kiu may be symbol-
ized simply as Ki when the uncompetitive character can be
assumed, but as this will be rather unusual it is best to use
the more explicit symbol. Comparison of equations 6.9–6.11
with equations 6.6–6.8 shows that uncompetitive inhibition is
a limiting case of mixed inhibition in which Kic approaches
inﬁnity, i/Ki being negligible at all values of i and hence
disappearing from equations 6.6–6.8; it is thus the converse
of competitive inhibition, the other limiting case of mixed
inhibition, in which Kiu approaches inﬁnity.
Uncompetitive inhibition is also, at least in principle, the
mechanistic converse of competitive inhibition, because it is
predicted for mechanisms in which the inhibitor binds only to
the enzyme-substrate complex and not to the free enzyme, as
illustrated in Figure 6.11. One example of clinical importance

case for abandoning it in favor of catalytic inhibition: the word
“uncompetitive” is not used in ordinary language and it is
easily confused with “noncompetitive”, itself a term that has
been used in various different ways in the biochemical liter-
ature; uncompetitive inhibition itself is much less common

sanctioned by universal use—indeed, the major texbook of
Laidler and Bunting used the term anticompetitive inhibition:
this better suggests that it is at the other end of the spectrum
from competitive inhibition, but it has failed to achieve any
broad acceptance, and in this book I shall continue to use the
more familiar name.
6.2.4
Summary of linear inhibition types
The properties of the various types of linear inhibition are
summarized in Table 6.1. They are easy to memorize as long
as the following points are noted:
1. The two limiting cases are competitive (speciﬁc) and un-
competitive (catalytic) inhibition; pure noncompetitive
inhibition is simply a special case of mixed inhibition in
which the two inhibition constants Kic and Kiu are equal.
2. The effects of inhibitors on Vapp/Kapp
m
and Vapp are
simple and regular; if they are decreased at all by the
inhibitor they are decreased by factors of (1 + i/Kic) and
(1 + i/Kiu) respectively.
3. The effects of inhibitors on Kapp
m
are confusing; they are
most easily remembered by thinking of Kapp
m
as Vapp
divided by Vapp/Kapp
m
and not as a parameter in its own
right.

there is a speciﬁc component in the inhibition (Figure 6.12),
and the slope (1/Vapp) varies with i if there is an catalytic
component in the inhibition (Figure 6.13). Alternatively, if
direct linear plots of Vapp against Kapp
m
are made at each value
of i, the common intersection point shifts in a direction that
is characteristic of the type of inhibition (Figure 6.14): for
competitive inhibition, the shift is to the right; for uncompeti-
tive inhibition it is directly towards the origin; and for mixed
inhibition, it is intermediate between these extremes.
Other plots are needed for determining the actual values
of the inhibition constants. The simplest approach is to esti-
mate the apparent kinetic constants at several values of i, by
the methods of Section 2.6, and to plot Kapp
m /Vapp and 1/V
§2.6, pages 45–53
against i. In each case the result should be a straight line,
with intercept −Kic on the i axis if Kapp
m /Vapp is plotted and
intercept −Kiu on the i axis if 1/Vapp is plotted. It may seem
more natural to determine Kic by plotting Kapp
m
rather than
Kapp
m /Vapp against i, but this is not advisable, for two reasons.
It is valid only if the inhibition is competitive, and it gives
a curve instead of a straight line if the inhibition is mixed;
even if the inhibition is strictly competitive, it is much less
accurate, because Kapp
m
can never be estimated as precisely as
Kapp
m /Vapp can (see Section 15.5.4).

Both of these equations indicate that a plot of 1/v against i

The ﬁrst factor in this expression cannot be zero, because we
have speciﬁed the condition that a1 and a2 are two different
substrate concentrations. So the second factor must be zero,
which means that i/Kic = −1, and hence i = −Kic and 1/v =
(1 −Kic/Kiu)/V at the point of intersection. In principle, if
several lines are drawn at different a values they should all
intersect at a common point; in practice, experimental error
will usually ensure some variation.
Notice that terms containing Kiu canceled out in going
from equation 6.14 to equation 6.15. Consequently, the Dixon
plot provides the value of Kic regardless of the value of Kiu,
measuring the speciﬁc component of the inhibition regardless
of whether the inhibition is competitive, mixed or pure non-
competitive. The horizontal coordinate of the point of inter-
section does not distinguish between these three possibilities,
but as both inhibition constants contribute to the vertical coor-
dinate the location of the point in relation to the abscissa axis
provides some qualitative information: intersection above the

axis indicates that the competitive component is stronger than
the uncompetitive component, and vice versa. In uncompet-
itive inhibition, when Kic is inﬁnite, the Dixon plot generates
parallel lines.
Although the Dixon plot does not give the value of the un-
competitive inhibition constant Kiu, an exactly similar deriva-
tion shows that it can be found by plotting a/v against i at sev-
eral a values as described by Cornish-Bowden. In this case, a
different set of straight lines is obtained, which intersect at the
point where i = −Kiu and a/v = Km(1 −Kiu/Kic)/V. Both

types of plot are shown schematically for the various types of
inhibition in Figure 6.15, in which one should note that both
plots are needed for determining both inhibition constants
for an enzyme showing mixed inhibition. An experimental
example with competitive inhibition is shown in Figure 6.16.
6.3.2
Combination plots
All of the plots described in the preceding section imply some
constraints on the experimental design for inhibitor exper-
iments (Section 6.8), because to have sufﬁcient number of
points on each line one needs several inhibitor concentrations
at each substrate concentration, or several substrate concen-
trations at each inhibitor concentration, or both. This is not
a constraint for computer analysis (Chapter 15), because a
properly written program has no requirement for the pairs
of concentrations to be points in a well deﬁned grid, but
even then one may want to display the results of the analysis
graphically. Hunter and Downs pointed out many years ago
that it is possible to plot all of the observations at haphaz-
ard combinations of substrate and inhibitor concentrations in
such a way that the resulting points fall on a single curve,
provided that the uninhibited rate at each substrate concen-
tration is known or can be calculated.

not need to be individually measured if the Michaelis–Menten
parameters are known, as they can easily be calculated. The
theoretical properties of the plot are illustrated in Figure 6.17,
but in reality the plot is more likely to resemble the example in
Figure 6.18. The scattered appearance is typical for a Hunter–
Downs plot, and means that the data must be measured with
high precision if one is to obtain a clean result.
There is no particular reason to design a series of inhibi-
tion experiments with the plot of Hunter and Downs in mind,
as it has no obvious advantage over the better known meth-
ods. However, for analyzing observations that were origi-
nally made with an arbitrary or haphazard design, without
any intention of kinetic analysis in mind, a combination plot
may offer the best solution. Chan provides further discussion,
including description of some variants that generate straight
lines for the common inhibition types.
6.4
Multiple inhibitors
In pharmacological applications it is often necessary to con-
sider the cumulative effects of two or more inhibitors that are
simultaneously present. Sometimes two drugs are effective
at much smaller concentrations when administered together
than are required for either by itself; in other cases they may
be effective when given separately, but partly nullify one
another’s effect when given together. If the drugs act on dif-
ferent enzymes in different metabolic pathways the analysis
is beyond the scope of this chapter, but if they both act on the
same enzyme we can consider the possibilities here.
If the binding is exclusive, with no more than one inhibitor
molecule able to be bound to the same enzyme form, the rate

In words, this equation tells us that the reciprocal rate in the
presence of n inhibitors should be (subject to the assumptions
made at the outset) the sum of the individual reciprocal rates
minus n −1 divided by the uninhibited rate. In practice, of
course, it is not necessarily obeyed, because it is not necessar-
ily true that the binding is exclusive. If the measured recipro-
cal rate proves to be larger than predicted by equation 6.17,
that is to say if the rate is smaller, then Chou and Talalay
deﬁne the cumulative effects of the inhibitors as synergism; if
the reciprocal rate is smaller (the rate is larger) than predicted
by the equation then there is antagonism.
This classiﬁcation is widely used for analyzing interaction

tion constants in such cases additional methods are needed.
It follows from the top line of equation 6.17 that a plot
of v0/v1,2...n against any inhibitor concentration i1 at con-
stant concentrations of substrate and all other inhibitors is
a straight line with a slope that is independent of all of the
other inhibitor concentrations (though not of the substrate

lines with inhibitors that were quite different in structure, like
ADP and 1,10-phenanthroline, and they concluded that these
last two inhibitors did not bind exclusively; in the terminol-
ogy of Chou and Talalay their effect was synergistic. More
generally, it follows from equation 6.18 that a plot of v0/v1,2...n
against any linear combinations of inhibitor concentrations
is a straight line, and this is the basis of an earlier type of
analysis proposed by Yagi and Ozawa. However, use of this
places extra constraints on the choice of inhibitor concentra-
tions to be used experimentally, as they have to be varied in
constant ratio, and in practice it has been virtually entirely
supplanted by the approach of Yonetani and Theorell.
As
discussed by Martínez-Irujo and co-workers, these methods
all embody some mechanistic assumptions, and if they are
taken beyond their range of applicability they are likely to
lead to meaningless results. For example, Balzarini and co-
workers found that various inhibitors of the proteinase from
human immunosuppressor virus lead to parallel lines in the
Yonetani–Theorell plots. However, as these inhibitors act as
chain terminators and not by direct action on the proteinase,
the behavior cannot be interpreted in terms of equation 6.12,
though it can be taken to indicate that therapeutic use of com-
binations of these inhibitors is unlikely to offer any advantage
over using them individually.
6.5
Relationship between inhibition constants
and the concentration for 50% inhibition
In biochemistry it is usual to characterize inhibitors in terms
of the type of inhibition and the inhibition constants, as has
been done to this point in this chapter. From the mechanistic
point of view this is clearly the appropriate approach, as
it is linked in a clear way to the mechanism of inhibition.
Nonetheless, enzyme inhibition is of crucial importance also
in pharmacology, and for obvious reasons pharmacologists
tend to be more interested in the effects of inhibition than in
its mechanism. As a result, it is common in the pharmacology
literature to characterize an inhibitor by the concentration i0.5

in the absence of the inhibitor. This is also often symbolized as
i50 or I50 (for the concentration that produces 50% inhibition)
or in some other similar ways.
This concentration i0.5 is not equal to either of the usual
inhibition constants except in pure noncompetitive inhibition,
which occurs too rarely in practice (see Section 6.2.2) to con-
stitute a useful example: in general it is safer to say that i0.5
is not an inhibition constant, and that one needs knowledge
of the type of inhibition to convert it into one. Cheng and
Prusoff, and also Brandt and co-workers, have given some

v =

2(Km + a) = 0.5v0
It follows that the abscissa intercept on either a Dixon plot

Omission of the term in Kiu gives the corresponding result for
competitive inhibition, and omission of the term in Kic gives
the corresponding result for competitive inhibition, as shown
in Table 6.2.

ducing the idea of enzyme speciﬁcity. As noted there, they
are of exactly the same form as equation 6.1: a competing
substrate behaves experimentally like a competitive inhibitor
if the rate is measured with respect to the other substrate, but
the parameter that corresponds to the competitive inhibition
constant is simply the Michaelis constant of the competing
substrate (not the dissociation constant for binding at equilib-
rium, as supposed by some authors). It follows, therefore, that
one can use the methods of Section 6.3 to estimate a Michaelis
constant by treating it as if it were an inhibition constant, and
the result should be the same as if it is measured directly. In
the example of fumarase discussed in Section 2.4, the column
of Table 2.2 labeled ‘‘Ki” (reproduced here in abbreviated

form as Table 6.3) shows the values that were measured in
that way, and it may be seen that they agreed with the direct
measurements.
6.6.2

total rate for mixtures prepared according to equation 6.22
is independent of the proportions of the substrates in the
mixture. A plot of vtotal against r, known as a competition plot,
therefore, provides a test of whether two substrates compete
for the same active site of an enzyme.
Chevillard and co-
workers examined a broader range of possible models than
those assumed in equations 2.16–2.17, and found that there
are three principal possibilities:

and A. Cornish-Bowden (1993)
“The competition plot: a simple
test of whether two reactions
occur at the same active site”

1. Competition for one site. The plot shows no dependence
of vtotal on r, or in other words it gives a horizontal
straight line, as illustrated in Figure 6.22 for competition
between glucose and fructose for the active site of yeast
hexokinase.
2. Reaction at separate sites. If the two reactions are com-
pletely separate with no interaction between either en-
zyme with the substrate of the other enzyme, the plot
shows a curve with a maximum.
In reality this is
rather an extreme case to consider, because if the two
substrates have some similarity with one another one
would expect each to be capable of inhibiting the en-
zyme for the other. However, provided that each sub-
strate binds more tightly to its own enzyme than to the
other the behavior is qualitatively the same, a curve
with a maximum, as illustrated in Figure 6.23 for phos-
phorylation of glucose and galactose by a mixture of
hexokinase and galactokinase.

ferent sites but each interacts with the wrong site more
strongly than with the right one, the plot shows a curve
with a minimum. Giordani and co-workers found that
nitrate reductase provides an example of pronounced
antagonistic effects.
152
6. Reversible Inhibition and Activation
If a spectrophotometric method is used for following the
reaction one can ensure that the total rate of reaction in the
presence of both substrates is the sum of the individual reac-
tions by following the reaction at an isosbestic point, a wave-
length where both reactions have the same speciﬁc change
of absorbance. However, this is not actually necessary, and

competition plot: a kinetic
method to assess whether an
enzyme that catalyzes multiple
reactions does so at a unique
site” Methods 24, 175–180

the analysis still gives correct results if the rates are measured
in units that are essentially arbitrary, such as change of ab-
sorbance with time at a wavelength where the two reactions
have different spectroscopic properties, as discussed by Cár-
denas.
Keleti and co-workers proposed a similar method,
and used it to show that serine and threonine react at the
same site on threonine dehydratase. Conceptually it is similar
to the method described here, but it is experimentally more
demanding, as it requires knowledge of the two Michaelis
constants for calculating the concentrations of the substrates,
which need to be varied in such a way that a/Km , a1/K1

constant.

Discussion of the activation of enzyme-catalyzed reactions
is complicated by the use of the term in enzymology with
several disparate meanings.
In this book I use it for the
converse of reversible inhibition: an activator is a species
that combines with an enzyme to increase its activity, without
itself undergoing a net change in the reaction. Other processes
that are sometimes called activation are the following:
1. Several enzymes, mainly extracellular catabolic en-
zymes such as pepsin, are secreted as inactive precur-
sors or zymogens, pepsinogen in the case of pepsin,
which are subsequently converted into the active en-
zyme by partial proteolysis (Figure 6.24).
The name
“zymogen activation” for this process is less common
now than it once was, but it is still used, for example by
Rousselet and co-workers.

as phosphorylase, exist in the cell in active and inac-

presence or absence of a phosphate group (see Sec-
tion 13.9.2). Interconversion of the two states requires

from ATP in one direction and removal of the phosphate
group by hydrolysis in the other (Figure 6.25): these pro-
cesses are often called activation and inactivation (for
example by Nadeau and co-workers), but they do not
correspond to activation and inhibition in the dynamic
sense used in this book.

phosphorylase phosphatase.
3. Many reactions were once said to be “activated” by
metal ions when the truth is that a metal ion forms part
of the substrate. For example, many ATP-dependent ki-
nases were said to be activated by Mg2,, not because of
the effect of Mg2, on the enzyme itself but because the
true substrate is the ion MgATP2, not ATP4, the pre-
dominant metal-free state at physiological pH. For ex-

ample, although rat-liver hexokinase D uses MgATP2
as substrate, free Mg2, is actually an inhibitor, not an
activator, and ATP4 is also an inhibitor, not a substrate,
as found by Storer and Cornish-Bowden. Although this
sort of confusion is understandable if ATP is regarded as
the reactant in reactions that actually involve MgATP2,
it is best to avoid it by expressing results in terms of
the concentrations of the actual species involved and
restricting the term “activation” to effects on the en-
zyme, especially as such effects do sometimes occur
with enzymes that have MgATP2 as a reactant, such
as pyruvate kinase, which was studied by MacFarlane
and Ainsworth.

The use of the term “activation” to refer to the chela-
tion of Mg2, by ATP is now quite uncommon, and
when current papers such as that of Tan and co-workers
refer to activation of ATP-dependent enzymes by Mg2,
they usually mean that Mg2, has a direct effect on the
enzyme, that is to say they use the same deﬁnition as in
this book.

Essential activation
The simplest kind of true activation is essential activation

that they refer to the enzyme with activator bound to it. This
scheme is similar to that for competitive inhibition, and it
generates a rate equation of similar form:

1) are the limit-
ing rate and Michaelis constant respectively for the activated
enzyme EX, and x is the concentration of X.
This equation differs from that for competitive inhibition,
equation 6.1, by having i/Kic replaced by Kx/x. Thus the rate
is zero in the absence of activator, as one would expect from
the mechanism. Despite the formal similarity between com-
petitive inhibition and essential activation, however, there is
an important difference in plausibility. Because a competitive
inhibitor is usually assumed to bind at the same site on the
enzyme as the substrate, it is easy to imagine that they can-
not bind simultaneously, and competitive inhibition is thus a
common phenomenon. However, it is less easy to visualize
an enzyme that cannot bind substrate at all in the absence
of activator. Moreover, one of the commonest activators is
the proton, which has no bulk and produces no steric effect.
Essential activation is thus less frequently encountered than
its counterpart in inhibition, though it occurs, for example, in
the activation of cathepsin C by chloride ions studied by Cigi´c
and Pain. In general it is useful mainly as a simple introduc-

of Biochemistry 264, 944–951
tion to the more complex kinds of activation, which unfortu-
nately require correspondingly more complex rate equations.
An important point to note from this discussion is that
there is nothing in the model of Figure 6.26 to suggest any
idea of competition, and so regardless of the similarity in
the algebra any such name as is unjustiﬁed and likely to be
confusing in many contexts. Unfortunately, however, expres-
sions that preserve the algebraic relationship while avoiding
mechanistic absurdity, like “the activation analog of compet-
itive inhibition”, are so cumbersome that the temptation to
use a shorter form is likely to be irresistible. In this case the
word “competitive” applied to activation should always be

placed in quotation marks, and the ﬁrst use of it in any context
should be accompanied by an explanation of what is actually
meant.
6.7.3
Mixed activation
The simplest realistic type of activation is the counterpart of
mixed inhibition, as shown in Figure 6.27. In this case the

activator is not required for substrate binding, but only for
catalysis, so one must logically include steps for binding of
substrate both to E and to EX. This means that activator-
binding steps are not dead-end reactions, though for sim-
plicity we shall treat them as equilibria nonetheless.
The
rate equation is then analogous to that for mixed inhibition
(equation 6.12):
v =
V′a
K′m(1 + Kx/x) + a(1 + K′x/x)
(6.23)
Essentially the same plots and methods can be used for inves-
tigating the type of activation as are used in linear inhibition
(Section 6.3), replacing i throughout by 1/x, Kic by 1/Kx and
Kiu by 1/K′
x. for example, Kx may be determined by a plot
analogous to a Dixon plot in which 1/v is plotted against
1/x at two or more values of a; the abscissa coordinate of the
point of intersection of the resulting straight lines then gives
−1/Kx. This is illustrated in Figure 6.28 for mixed activation,
but the plot also provides Kx in the case of essential activation.
The other activation constant K′
x follows in an analogous way
from a plot of a/v against 1/x, as illustrated in Figure 6.29.

Hyperbolic activation and inhibition
In practice, activators often behave in a more complex way
than suggested by equation 6.23 because there may be some
catalytic activity in the absence of the activator.3
If this is
so, but the rate constants of the two forms of the enzyme are
different, the mechanism may be represented by Figure 6.30.

can produce hyperbolic inhibi-
tion or activation, or a com-
bination of the two. All of the
simple mechanisms for inhibi-
tion and activation (apart from
product inhibition) are special
cases of this mechanism.
There are several important points to note about this
mechanism.
First, the activator-dissociation steps are not
dead-end reactions and so they do not satisfy the conditions
discussed in Section 5.7.3 and are therefore not necessarily at
§5.7.3, pages 124–125
equilibrium. However, if this is taken into account the kinetic
3This is different from the common mechanisms for inhibition, for which
it is quite usual for the enzyme to have no activity when inhibitor is bound.

behavior becomes rather complicated, and for discussing it
here I shall assume that the rate equation has the form it
would have if all the activator- and substrate-binding steps
were equilibria. Second, this is not necessarily a mechanism
for activation at all: it could equally well result in inhibition
if the EX complex is less reactive than the free enzyme. In-
deed, it is more complicated than that, because the conditions
that decide whether X is an activator or an inhibitor may
be different in different ranges of substrate concentration: if
k2 > k′
2 then X inhibits at high substrate concentrations;
if k1k2/(k−1 + k2) > k′
2/(k′
1 + k′
2) then X inhibits at low
substrate concentrations; only if the two inequalities are con-
sistent is the behavior consistent over the whole range. As
Figure 6.30 takes account of this possible duality of behavior,
it is what Botts and Morales called a general modiﬁer mecha-
nism, where modiﬁer is a term that embraces both inhibitors
J. Botts and M. Morales (1954)

effects of modiﬁers and of
enzyme multivalency upon the

and activators.
When the mechanism is fully analyzed, it turns out that
plots of 1/Vapp or Kapp
m /Vapp against inhibitor or reciprocal
activator concentration are not straight lines but rectangular
hyperbolas, and for this reason the behavior is called hyper-
bolic activation or hyperbolic inhibition4. All of this may seem
too complicated for an elementary account (even without
worrying that the binding steps should not strictly be treated
as equilibria). However, hyperbolic effects ought not to be
forgotten about completely, because Figure 6.30 represents a
plausible mechanism that one should expect to apply to real
cases quite often. The fact that few examples (especially of
hyperbolic inhibition) have been reported, therefore, is more
likely to reﬂect a failure to recognize them than a genuinely
rare kind of behavior. Hyperbolic effects are not difﬁcult to
recognize experimentally, but the symptoms are often dis-
missed as just an unwelcome complexity. It is important to
use a wide enough range of inhibitor and activator concen-
trations to know whether or not the rate tends to zero at
very high inhibitor or very low activator concentration. One
should particularly note whether the expected “linear” plots
are actually straight lines or not; any systematic curvature
should be checked and if conﬁrmed it is likely to indicate
hyperbolic effects, as reported, for example, in a study of
acetylcholinesterase by Pietsch and co-workers.

used instead, to emphasize that some activity remains in the complete ab-
sence of activator or at saturation with inhibitor.

saturating concentrations of ethanol decreased the apparent
limiting rate for the reaction with acetaldehyde by a factor
of about four at pH 7, but to see this behavior clearly they
needed to examine ethanol concentrations as high as 1 M,
and to notice that the lines plotted at much lower ethanol
concentrations were not strictly straight.
6.8
Design of inhibition experiments
Before embarking on a discussion of the design of inhibi-
tion experiments, I should perhaps comment on why this
section comes after a discussion of how such experiments
are analyzed (Sections 6.2–6.3). As design should obviously
§§6.2–6.3, pages 134–145
precede analysis in any well planned experiment, it might
seem more logical to discuss the two topics in that order.
However, it is my experience that the most effective way of
learning the importance of design is to suffer the difﬁculties
that arise when one tries to analyze the results of a badly
designed experiment, one that has been carried out without
any thought being given to the information it is intended to
supply. Moreover, some knowledge of analytical methods is
needed before the principles of design can be appreciated.
There are two primary aims in inhibition experiments:
to identify the type of inhibition and to estimate the values
of the inhibition constants.
If the experiment is carefully
158
6. Reversible Inhibition and Activation
designed it is usually possible to satisfy both of these aims
simultaneously. I shall initially assume that the inhibition is
linear and that the relations given in Table 6.1 apply, because
this is likely to be adequate as a ﬁrst approximation, and it
is useful to characterize the linear behavior before trying to
understand any complexities that may be present.
It is evident from Table 6.1 that any competitive compo-
nent in the inhibition will be most pronounced at low concen-
trations of substrate, because competitive inhibitors decrease
the apparent value of V/Km, which characterizes the kinetics
at low concentrations of substrate; conversely, any uncom-
petitive component will be most noticeable at high substrate
concentrations.
Obviously, therefore, the inhibition can be
fully characterized only if it is investigated at both high and
low substrate concentrations. Consequently conditions that
are ideal for assaying an enzyme may well be unsatisfactory
for investigating its response to inhibitors. For example, a
simple calculation shows that a competitive inhibitor at a
concentration equal to its inhibition constant decreases the
measured rate by less than 10% if a = 10Km; although an
effect of this size ought to be easily detected in any careful
experiment, it might still be dismissed as of little consequence
if it was not realized that the effect at low substrate concentra-
tion would be much bigger.
Just as in a simple experiment without inhibitors it is pru-
dent to include a values from about 0.2Km to as high as conve-
niently possible (Section 4.3.1), so in an inhibition experiment
§4.3.1, pages 95–98
the inhibitor concentrations should extend from about 0.2Kic
or 0.2Kiu (whichever is the smaller) to as high as possible
without making the rate too small to measure accurately (and,
at least for the lower substrate concentrations, observations
without inhibitor should also be included). At each i value the
a values should be chosen as in Section 4.3.1, but relative to
Kapp
m , not to Km. This is because it is the apparent values of the
kinetic constants that characterize the Michaelis–Menten be-
havior at each inhibitor concentration, not the true values. A
simple example of a possible experimental design is given in
Table 6.4. Note that there is no requirement to use the same set
of a values at each i value, or the same set of i values at each
a value and doing so means devoting experimental effort to
combinations that provide little information. Nonetheless, for
plotting the results in any of the ways discussed in Section 6.3
§6.3, pages 140–145
it is convenient if several of the same a and i values are used
in each experiment, to produce a reasonable number of points
on each line whether one uses a as abscissa (for example, in
6.9 Inhibitory effects of substrates
159
determining apparent Michaelis–Menten parameters at each
i value) or i as abscissa (for example, in plots of 1/v or a/v
against i). Accordingly, Table 6.4 includes some combinations
that would probably not be included if each line of the table
were considered in isolation.
If these recommendations are followed (as a guide, of
course, not rigidly, because the particular numbers used in Ta-
ble 6.4 are unlikely to apply exactly to any speciﬁc example),
any hyperbolic character in the inhibition ought to be obvious
without the need for further experiments. Consequently there
is no need to add appreciably to the remarks at the end of Sec-
tion 6.7.4. The main consideration is to include i values that
§6.7.4, pages 155–157
are high enough and numerous enough to indicate whether
the rate approaches zero or not when the inhibitor approaches
saturation.

ties of enzymes has come from the study of a small group of
enzymes, the extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, which include
pepsin, lysozyme, ribonuclease, papain and, most notably,
chymotrypsin.
Although this is less true now than it was
40 years ago, chymotrypsin still appears in the literature,
by implication as a “typical enzyme”, far more often than
any biological importance it may have could possibly justify.5
These enzymes share various properties that make them em-
inently suitable for detailed study: they are abundant, easily
crystallized, stable, monomeric, unspeciﬁc and can be treated
as single-substrate enzymes, as the second substrate is water
in every case.
However, all of these properties disqualify
them from being regarded as “typical enzymes”, which are
present in low amounts, difﬁcult to purify and crystallize,
unstable, oligomeric, highly speciﬁc and catalyze reactions of
more than one substrate (not counting water).
All of these extracellular hydrolytic enzymes share an-
other unusual characteristic, one that is a deﬁnite disadvan-
tage: their natural substrates are all ill-deﬁned polymers, and
as a result they are nearly always studied with unnatural
5 For example, searching for “chymotrypsin” at PubMed yields around
300 publications in 2010, more than three times as many as a search for
“phosphofructokinase”. If I had to choose an enzyme that living organisms
could probably manage without, chymotrypsin would be a strong candidate.

6. Reversible Inhibition and Activation
substrates that are much less bulky than the real ones. How-
ever, an enzyme that can bind a macromolecule is likely to be
able to bind a small molecule in many different ways. Thus,
instead of a single enzyme–substrate complex that breaks
down to products, there may be numerous nonproductive
complexes in addition that do not form products. This be-
havior has been studied with particular reference to papain,
which has seven “subsites” designated S4, S3, S2, S1, S′
1, S′
2, S′
3,
with afﬁnity for amino acid residues of proteins, hydrolysis
occurring between the residues bound to subsites S1 and S′
1.
Schechter and Berger showed that at least six of these sites,
I. Schechter and A. Berger
(1967) “On the size of the active
site in proteases. I. Papain”
Biochemical and Biophysical
Research Communications 27,
157–162
from S3 to S′
3, have an inﬂuence on the reaction.
We can
suppose, therefore, that a bound protein substrate will be
held in a correct position and conformation for catalysis by
interactions with these six sites, as illustrated schematically in
Figure 6.31, and that incorrect binding will not be very likely.
However, a small model substrate such as a dipeptide cannot
interact with all of the six subsites, and may therefore bind to
one of the two at the site of reaction, but not to the other, so
that other molecules are blocked from arriving at the catalytic
site (Figure 6.32): this is the case we shall be considering in
this section. There is, however, another possibility, illustrated
in Figure 6.33, where the small molecule binds incorrectly but
still leaves room for another molecule to bind correctly. If this
happens the kinetic behavior may be unchanged, but there
will be an effect on measurements of equilibrium binding
of substrate analogs by the sort of technique discussed in
Section 12.3.1.

A mechanism to take account of nonproductive binding is
shown in Figure 6.34, in which AE represents all such nonpro-

competitive inhibition (Figure 6.2) with the inhibitor replaced

this mechanism and so the observed kinetics cannot indicate
whether nonproductive binding is signiﬁcant or not. Unfor-
tunately, it is often the expected values that are of interest
in an experiment, as they refer to the productive pathway.
Hence the measured values V and Km may be less, by an
unknown and unmeasurable amount, than the quantities of
interest. Only V/Km gives a correct measure of the catalytic
properties of the enzyme.
For highly speciﬁc enzymes, plausibility arguments can be
used to justify excluding nonproductive binding from consid-
eration, but for unspeciﬁc enzymes, such as chymotrypsin,
comparison of results with different substrates may some-
times provide evidence of the phenomenon.
For example,
Ingles and Knowles measured the rates of hydrolysis of a

series of acylchymotrypsins, by measuring kcat values for the
chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the corresponding p-
nitrophenyl esters, in which the “deacylation” step, the hy-
drolysis of the acylchymotrypsin intermediate, was known
to be rate-limiting.
The results (Table 6.5) were somewhat
complicated by the unequal reactivity of the various acyl
groups towards nucleophiles. Ingles and Knowles therefore
measured the corresponding rate constants for hydrolysis
catalyzed by hydroxide ion. On dividing the rate constants
for chymotrypsin catalysis by those for base catalysis a most
interesting pattern emerged: the order of the reactivity of the
speciﬁc L substrates was exactly reversed with the poor D
substrates, so Ac-L-Trp > Ac-L-Phe ≫Ac-L-Leu ≫Ac-Gly ≫

The table shows data of Ingles and Knowles for the chymotrypsin-
catalyzed hydrolysis of the p-nitrophenyl esters of various acetyl
amino acids. For these substrates the hydrolysis of the correspond-
ing acetylaminoacylchymotrypsins is rate-limiting, and so the mea-
sured values of the catalytic constant kcat are actually ﬁrst-order rate
constants for this hydrolysis reaction. The values are compared with
the second-order rate constants kOH for base-catalyzed hydrolysis
of the p-nitrophenyl esters of the corresponding benzyloxycarbonyl
amino acids.

is in terms of nonproductive binding: for acyl groups with
the correct L conﬁguration, the large hydrophobic sidechains
permit tight and rigid binding in the correct mode, largely
ruling out nonproductive complexes, but for acyl groups with
the D conﬁguration, the same sidechains favor tight and rigid
binding in nonproductive modes.
Nonproductive binding is not usually considered in the
context of inhibition; indeed, it is usually not considered at all,
but it follows exactly the same mechanism as that most often
considered for competitive inhibition, and it is important to
take account of it as a possibility when comparing results
with different substrates of an unspeciﬁc enzyme. The term
substrate inhibition is usually reserved for the uncompetitive
analog of nonproductive binding, which is considered next.

be able to bind to the active site,
forcing the ﬁrst molecule bound
into a position that does not
allow reaction.
6.9.2
Substrate inhibition
For some enzymes it is possible for a second substrate mole-
cule to bind to the enzyme–substrate complex, as illustrated
in Figures 6.35 and 6.38.
The mechanism is analogous to
that usually considered for uncompetitive inhibition (Sec-
tion 6.2.3), and the rate equation is as follows:

The smaller panels show the appearance of
the corresponding plots of (b) 1/v against 1/a and (c) a/v against a. The
impression that the plot in (b) shows the inhibition more clearly than that in
(c) is an illusion caused by the continuation of the curve in (b) to 1/a = 0.0167,
that is to say to a = 60, whereas in (c) it stops at a = 5. In general the
likelihood of recognizing whether substrate inhibition occurs depends more
on the range of data plotted than on the type of plot. See also Figure 6.37.

they satisfy the usual deﬁnitions of the Michaelis–Menten pa-
rameters in the simple two-step model (Section 2.2); however,
§2.2, pages 28–31
they are written with primes because they are not Michaelis–
Menten parameters, as equation 6.25 is not equivalent to the
Michaelis–Menten equation: the effect of the term in a2 is to
make the rate approach zero rather than V′ when a is large,
and K′
m is not equal to the value of a when v = V′/2. The
curve of v as a function of a is plotted in Figure 6.36, together
with the corresponding plots of a/v against a and 1/v against
1/a; these last two are not straight lines but a parabola and
hyperbola respectively, but if Ksi is large compared with K′
m
(as is usually the case), they are straight enough at low values
of a for V′ and K′
m to be estimated from them in the usual way.

6. Reversible Inhibition and Activation
Substrate inhibition is not usually important if substrate
concentrations are kept at or below their likely physiological
values (though there are some important exceptions, such as
phosphofructokinase), but it can become so at high substrate
concentrations, and provides a useful diagnostic tool for dis-
tinguishing between possible reaction pathways, as discussed
in Section 8.5.
§8.5, pages 211–213
Summary of Chapter 6
• Reversible inhibitors interfere with catalysis by binding
§6.1, pages 133–134
reversibly to the enzyme to produce a complex that cannot
react.
• In linear inhibition the apparent values of 1/V and Km/V
§6.2, pages 134–140
are linear functions of the inhibitor concentration.
• Competitive inhibition (typically by substrate analogs),
§6.2.1, pages 134–136
is characterized by a decreased apparent value of the speci-
ﬁcity constant kcat/Km.
• Decrease of the apparent values of both kcat/Km and kcat is
§6.2.2, pages 136–139
called mixed inhibition, though some authors call it non-
competitive inhibition, a term that was classically applied
to a special case of mixed inhibition with equal competitive
and uncompetitive components.
• Uncompetitive inhibition is characterized by a decreased
§6.2.3, pages 139–140
apparent value of the catalytic constant kcat.
• An inhibition constant Ki is the inhibitor concentration
§6.2, pages 134–140
that causes a 50% decrease in the apparent value of the
relevant parameter.
• Simple plots of inhibition data include plots of apparent
§6.3, pages 140–145
parameter values or of the reciprocal rate as functions of the
inhibitor concentration.
• In pharmacology it is common to characterize a inhibitor by
§6.5, pages 147–149
the concentration of inhibitor needed to decrease the rate by
50%. Except in unimportant special cases this has no simple
correspondence with inhibitor constants.
• The effect on one another of substrates that compete for the
§6.6, pages 149–152
same active site affect resembles competitive inhibition, and
provides the basis for deﬁning enzyme speciﬁcity.
Problems
165
• An activator is a molecule that binds to an enzyme to pro-
duce a complex with higher catalytic activity than the enzyme
without activator bound.
§6.7, pages 152–157
• The essential principle for designing an inhibition experi-
§6.8, pages 157–159
ment is that the parameter of interest must have an effect on
the rate in the conditions considered.
• A substrate may have an inhibitory effect on its own reaction.
§6.9, pages 159–164
If this is competitive in character it is called nonproductive
binding and has no easily observable effects, but must be
deduced from indirect evidence; if it is uncompetitive it
causes a decrease in rate at high substrate concentrations and
is called substrate inhibition.
Problems
Solutions and notes are on pages 463–464.
6.1
Initial studies of an esterase using a racemic mixture as
substrate revealed that the L enantiomer was the true
substrate, as it was completely converted into prod-
uct whereas the D enantiomer could be recovered un-
changed at the end of the reaction. On the basis of this
result the kinetics of the reaction were analyzed assum-
ing that the D enantiomer had no effect on the enzyme,
and a Michaelis constant for the L enantiomer was esti-
mated to be 2 mM. Subsequent work made it clear that
it would have been more reasonable to assume that the
D enantiomer was a competitive inhibitor with Kic equal
to the Km value of the L enantiomer. How should the
original Km estimate be revised to take account of this
information?

The data in Table 6.6 show the initial rates (in arbitrary
units) measured for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction at var-

Tight-binding and
Irreversible Inhibitors
7.1
Tight-binding inhibitors
Tight-binding inhibitors fall at the boundary between re-
versible and irreversible inhibitors, because although the in-
hibition can be reversed (for example by thorough dialysis to
remove the inhibitor) the dissociation may be slow enough to
give the impression of an irreversible effect. In some ways
it would be better to call them slowly dissociating inhibitors.
Tightness of binding and slowness of dissociation may appear
to be two distinct properties, but they are closely linked,
because there is a limit to the rate at which binding can
occur, known as the diffusion limit: molecules cannot bind to
one another any faster than they can diffuse to one another
through the solution. The on rate constants cannot therefore
exceed the limit of about 7 × 109 M−1 · s−1 suggested by
Fersht, and in practice they may be much smaller, if it is

Mechanism in Protein Science,
pages 164–167, Freeman, New
York
not sufﬁcient for a small molecule to encounter a protein
molecule, but must do so at an appropriate location if a
reaction is to ensue.
In the data tabulated by Fersht for
binding of substrates to enzymes, for example, the on rate
constants range from 2.4 × 106 M−1 · s−1 (tyrosine binding
to tyrosyl tRNA synthetase) to about 109 M−1 · s−1 (reduced
NAD binding to lactate dehydrogenase), nearly all of them
smaller than 108 M−1 · s−1. Consider now the implications

that this limit has on the dissociation constant of an inhibitor,
considering the dissociation to be slow if it occurs with a rate
constant of less than 1 s−1. Given that an inhibition constant
Ki can be written as the ratio k−1/k1 of the off and on rate
constants, this gives a limit of Ki = 1/108 M = 10−8 M,
or 10 nM. Many pharmacologically important inhibitors bind
more tightly than this, and if they cannot achieve lower Ki
values by increasing k1 they must do so by decreasing k−1,
that is to say by dissociating more slowly, as indicated in
Table 7.1.

In practice values of k1 are

the largest possible values
of k−1 are smaller than those
shown in the table.
Independent of the slowness of dissociation, tight-binding
inhibitors present another difﬁculty for analysis of the in-
hibition by the methods described in the previous chapter,
because an inhibition constant of the order of 10 nM or less
is likely to be less than the concentration of the enzyme. This
means that to vary the degree of inhibition one needs to vary
the inhibitor concentration in a range lower than the enzyme
concentration, and one cannot make the usual assumption
that the inhibitor concentration is unaffected by binding to
the enzyme and that therefore the free and total inhibitors
concentrations are the same. If we analyze a simple binding
process I + E = EI with dissociation constant Ki, without
assuming that either I or E is in excess, the deﬁnition of Ki
is
Ki = (e0 −x)(i0 −x)/x
where x is the concentration of complex EI. This can be rear-
ranged into a quadratic equation in x:
x2 −(e0 + i0 + Ki)x = e0i0 = 0
which may be solved by the usual methods for quadratic
equations to yield
x = 0.5{e0 + i0 + Ki −[(e0 + i0 + Ki)2 −4e0i0]0.5}
(7.1)
Mathematically a quadratic equation has two solutions, but

the other solution, with the ﬁrst minus sign in this equation
replaced by a plus sign, leads to physically impossible results;
for example, putting e0 = 0 or i0 = 0 leads to a positive
value of x, even though obviously no EI can be formed in the
absence of E or I.

binding inhibitor takes the following form:

The nonlinear character of this equation is not a problem

various graphical methods for analyzing tight binding were

Derivation of equation 7.2, discussed by Morrison, and
by Henderson (1972), is rather complicated, though the result
can be recognized as having equation 7.1 as a basis. It is also
not obvious how to simplify it to yield the appropriate result
when e0 is negligible compared with iapp
0.5 and i0: one cannot
just set e0 to zero as this leads to an indeﬁnite result. Instead,
deﬁning the contents of the square brackets in equation 7.2 as
g2 it is simple to rearrange its expression to read as follows:
g2 =

i0 + iapp
0.5
2
	
1 + e2
0 + 2e0iapp
0.5 −2e0i0
(i0 + iapp
0.5 )2

Here e2
0 is negligible when e0 is small, and the square root of
the sum in the square brackets can be approximated by the
ﬁrst two terms of the binomial expansion, using the general
relationship (1 + x)0.5 ≈1 + 0.5x when x is small, so
g ≈i0 + iapp
0.5 + e0(iapp
0.5 −i0)
i0 + iapp
0.5
Substituting this expression for g into equation 7.2, followed
by simplifying and rearranging the result, leads to the follow-
ing equation:
vi

=
1
1 + i0/iapp
0.5
which it is then straightforward to rearrange further as fol-

0.5
The relationship to equation 6.16 is now made obvious by
recognizing iapp
0.5 as the quantity deﬁned in equation 6.20 as
the inhibitor concentration for half-inhibition. This deﬁnition
is still valid for the tight-binding case, but it provides the
free value of this concentration, whereas the total value is of
greater practical interest, and for a tight-binding inhibitor it is
not the same as the free value. Substituting vi/v0 = 0.5 into
172
7. Tight-binding and Irreversible Inhibitors
equation 7.2, we can solve it for i0 to obtain the total inhibitor
concentration for half-inhibition:
i0.5 = iapp
0.5 + 0.5e0
(7.3)
Myers derived this relationship from a more general one
due to Goldstein. It can be rationalized by realizing that at
half-inhibition exactly half of the enzyme is complexed by
inhibitor, and so 0.5e0 is the difference between the free and
total inhibitor concentrations, as indicated in Figure 7.1.

Morrison examined the practical behavior of equation 7.2
in detail.
An important characteristic is that although it
predicts deviations from the ordinary inhibition equations
described in Chapter 6, the deviations are small enough to
Chapter 6, pages 133–168
be overlooked if examined over an inadequate range of in-
hibitor and substrate concentrations. However, the slopes and
intercepts of the apparently straight lines do not behave in
the ways expected from the simpler analysis, and, in particu-
lar, competitive inhibitors can easily be mistaken for mixed
inhibitors if inhibitor depletion is ignored.

with very small inhibition constants that these were in reality
competitive inhibitors.
7.2
Irreversible inhibitors
7.2.1
Nonspeciﬁc irreversible inhibition
True irreversible inhibitors or catalytic poisons have effects that
cannot be reversed by removing the inhibitor by dialysis or
dilution. In most cases the inhibitor reacts with an essential
group in the enzyme to bring about a covalent change, but
in a few cases, especially with heavy-metal ions, there is
not necessarily any covalent change but simply a binding
that cannot be reversed on any reasonable time scale.
In
fact, many enzymes are poisoned by traces of heavy-metal
ions, and for this reason it is common practice to carry out
kinetic studies in the presence of complexing agents, such as
ethylenediamine tetraacetate. This is particularly important
in the puriﬁcation of enzymes: in crude preparations, the
total protein concentration is high, and the many protein
impurities present sequester almost all the metal ions that
may be present, but the purer an enzyme becomes the less
it is protected by other proteins and the more important it is
7.2 Irreversible inhibitors
173
to add alternative sequestering agents. Knowledge of which
metals poison particular enzymes can be used as a clue to the
groups necessary for enzyme activity, for example, poisoning
by mercury(II) compounds has often been used to implicate
sulfhydryl groups in the catalytic activity of enzymes.
Various organic inhibitors act in the same sort of way,
reacting with particular functional groups in proteins and
inactivating enzymes if the groups in question are necessary
for activity. For example, other inhibitors that react with sulf-
hydryl groups include 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) and
iodoacetate, of which the latter also reacts more slowly with
other kinds of group, such as the hydroxyl groups of tyrosine
residues; acetic anhydride reacts with groups capable of being
acetylated, principally amino groups but also hydroxyl and
sulfhydryl groups.
In many of these cases the inhibition
is rather unspeciﬁc and appears to proceed in a single step
without prior formation of an enzyme–inhibitor complex. Ki-
netically, therefore, we may observe an irreversible second-
order reaction, as discussed in Section 1.2.3.
§1.2.3, pages 5–7
7.2.2
Speciﬁc irreversible inhibition
A more speciﬁc type of irreversible inhibition occurs when
the inactivating reaction follows an initial binding similar
to the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex that re-
sults from afﬁnity between the inhibitor and a particular site
on the enzyme, normally close to or part of the active site.
The scheme to represent this process resembles the ordinary
Briggs–Haldane scheme (equation 2.6) with the important
difference that the free enzyme is not regenerated in the sec-
ond step; instead the initial complex EI is transformed into a
second complex E′ that does not undergo any further reaction:

Here eactive represents the total concentration of active en-
zyme, including E and EI but not E′. The kinetics for this
scheme depend on the relative magnitudes of k−1 and k2. If
k2 ≪k−1 then a treatment developed by Kitz and Wilson is

applicable. They were concerned with the effects of various
compounds on acetylcholinesterase and made essentially the
same assumptions as those of Michaelis and Menten for the
catalytic process: they assumed that the inactivation of an

enzyme E by an inhibitor I would proceed through an inter-
mediate EI that was in equilibrium with E and I throughout
the process.
With these assumptions the concentration of
EI at any time is equal to (eactive −x)i/Ki and the rate of
inactivation is given by
−deactive

Ki + i
(7.5)
Note that although k2eactive is the limiting rate of inactiva-
tion at saturating concentrations of inhibitor, and thus corre-
sponds to V in the Michaelis–Menten equation, it is not a con-
stant, because eactive decreases as the inactivation proceeds.
If the inhibitor is in sufﬁcient excess for i to be essentially
constant the loss of activity is a pseudo-ﬁrst-order process,
and analysis by the methods of Section 1.5 would give an
§1.5, pages 11–13
apparent ﬁrst-order rate constant kapp = k2i/(Ki + i). As this
has the form of the Michaelis–Menten equation one can use
any of the methods of Chapter 2 to estimate k2 and Ki from
Chapter 2, pages 25–75
measurements of kapp at different values of i.
If k2 is not small enough to allow formation of EI to be
treated as an equilibrium, but is still smaller than k−1, the
treatment of Kitz and Wilson can be modiﬁed as proposed by
Malcolm and Radda, with Ki now deﬁned as (k−1 + k2)/k1,

essentially the same as the deﬁnition of the Michaelis con-
stant in Briggs–Haldane conditions (Section 2.3.1). With this
§2.3.1, pages 32–33
modiﬁcation the analysis is essentially the same as before, and
describes the observed behavior well. This simple treatment
breaks down, however, if k2 exceeds k−1, because then it is
no longer possible to ignore the accumulation of E′, so eactive
as deﬁned above is no longer a useful quantity to consider.
In these conditions, therefore, the loss of activity does not
follow simple ﬁrst-order kinetics: there is no exact analytical
solution, but the kinetics may still be analyzed by numerical
methods.
7.3
Substrate protection experiments
The substrate of an enzyme often protects it against inactiva-
tion by an irreversible inhibitor; in other words, the substrate
acts as an inhibitor of the inactivation reaction. If the substrate
is itself able to undergo its ordinary reaction (either because
it is a one-substrate reaction or because the other necessary
components, such as water, are present also), the reaction

The similarity to equation 6.1 is obvious, though to avoid con-
fusion one must emphasize that the substrate and inhibitor
have reversed their usual roles, and v represents the rate of
loss of activity, not the rate of the ordinary reaction catalyzed
by the enzyme. It follows that one can measure Km by the
methods one would use to measure Kic in the ordinary cases
of competitive inhibition, provided that one remembers that
V is not a constant, as it decreases as the enzyme becomes
inactivated: thus one must ﬁrst obtain apparent inhibition
constants Kapp
i
by the method described in Section 7.2.2 and
§7.2.2, pages 173–174
then obtain Km from the linear dependence on a, Kapp

Ki(1 + a/Km).
As a method of determining Km this may seem to have no
obvious advantage over more conventional ones. Its impor-
tance comes from the extension to the case where A is the ﬁrst
substrate of a reaction that cannot proceed in the absence of
other substrates (compare Section 8.4.1). Binding of substrate
§8.4.1, pages 204–207
in the inactivation experiment is then an equilibrium, and so
the analysis yields the true dissociation constant Ks instead of
Km. This approach requires only catalytic amounts of enzyme

ate, the natural substrate of the enzyme, sufﬁciently to be
accepted as substrate for the early steps in the mechanism,
but not sufﬁciently to complete the catalytic cycle. Instead
it forms a stable complex with the enzyme and does not
release the pyridoxamine phosphate form of the enzyme,
which is then unable to react further. This is an example of a
mechanism-based inactivator, often but less satisfactorily1 called
a suicide substrate.
In most of this book we have assumed that there is an
unambiguous distinction between a substrate of an enzyme
and an inhibitor.
However, this is too simple, because it
may happen that the catalytic mechanism itself can convert
a substrate into a structurally different state that can inacti-
vate the enzyme: the enzyme–substrate complex may then
break down in the usual way to products, or it may, in some
constant fraction r of catalytic cycles known as the partition
ratio, convert the enzyme irreversibly to an inactive state. The
inactivation is typically observed to be of ﬁrst order with
respect to time, with a rate constant that depends on the
substrate concentration, showing saturation as in a normal
enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
Waley analyzed the kinetics of such behavior in terms of a

The rate constant for inactivation is k′, and the constancy of

the ratio of two constants. In mechanistic terms it is explained
by the fact that once the reactive species EP has been irre-

can alter the proportions of molecules that proceed to E + P or
to inactive E′.
Analysis of the scheme by normal steady-state methods
leads to the following equation for the rate of inactivation v′:

Despite the superﬁcial similarity to the Michaelis–Menten
equation, ε in equation 7.7 is not a constant, unlike e0, and to
minimize the risk of misunderstanding it is given a symbol
different from e.
Notice that it indicates that the loss of
activity is not strictly of ﬁrst order, because the rate “constant”
is a function of a, the concentration of substrate molecules,
which must decrease as the reaction proceeds. In practice,
however, the deviation from linearity will not be easily visible
in a semilogarithmic plot if a0, the initial value of a, is large
compared with k3/k′e0.
For every molecule of enzyme inactivated, r molecules of
substrate are transformed into product, and so equation 7.7
can be written as

7. Tight-binding and Irreversible Inhibitors
This equation allows an assessment of the properties needed
for a useful mechanism-based inactivator, and explains why
designing one has been a difﬁcult task and why a good un-
derstanding of the structural properties that make a substrate
a good substrate has often been a very disappointing guide.
Clearly τ0.5 needs to be made small, and understanding of
enzyme catalysis suggests how this can be done, because
it suggests how k′
cat can be maximized and K′
m minimized.
However, a large k′
cat can be undermined by a large r, and it
achieves little if the catalysis is optimized at the expense of
inactivation efﬁciency.
As Copeland describes in detail, there are seven criteria
R. A. Copeland (2005) Evalua-
tion of Enzyme Inhibitors in Drug
Discovery pages 228–233,
Wiley–Interscience, Hoboken
for establishing that an inhibitor acts as a mechanism-based
inhibitor, some of which will be obvious from the discussion
above:
1. The inhibition must be time-dependent.
Addition of
fresh enzyme after complete inactivation should regen-
erate activity, with a new curve of inactivation.
2. The inhibition must be saturable.
This follows from
equation 7.6, which has the characteristics of a normal
enzyme-catalyzed reaction, with binding of inactivator
followed by further steps.
3. The substrate should protect against inactivation. In the
presence of a normal substrate the mechanism resem-
bles one for competition between substrates.
4. The inactivation should be irreversible, as the formation
of the inactive species E′ is assumed in equation 7.6 to
be irreversible. Removal of the inactivator by dialysis,
dilution or other methods should result in no recovery
of activity.
5. The inactivation should be one-to-one, at least if the
enzyme is a monomer with one active site. Not only
should substrate molecules be able to compete with the
inactivator (criterion 3), but other inactivator molecules
should also compete, and no more than one should
be able to bind at a time.
This criterion is more ar-
guable if the enzyme is oligomeric: if subunit inter-
actions cause total or partial inactivation of the whole
enzyme molecule if one active site is inactivated, then
the stoichiometry will not be one-to-one.
7.5 Identifying essential groups
179
6. Inactivation must require catalysis: the inactivator is not
only an inactivator, it is also a substrate, as drawn in
equation 7.6. The inactivation must be a branch from the
normal catalytic mechanism, not an independent reac-
tion. As Copeland discusses, this is both important and
difﬁcult to demonstrate conclusively. One indication is
that the kinetic parameters for both processes should
respond in the same way to changes in pH, the presence
of inhibitors, or other conditions.
7. The enzyme must be inactivated without prior release
of the inactivator.
7.5
Chemical modiﬁcation as a means of
identifying essential groups
The great improvements during recent decades in the ease
and rapidity with which three-dimensional structures of pro-
teins can be determined, whether by X-ray crystallography
or by magnetic resonance, has removed some of the need
for methods based on chemical modiﬁcation. Nonetheless,
however strongly a three-dimensional structure may suggest
a mechanism it cannot demonstrate it, and measurements of
activity remain important.
In the context it has been common practice to deduce the
nature of groups required for enzyme catalysis by observing
whether activity is lost when certain residues are chemically
modiﬁed. Unfortunately, however, a particular residue may
be essential for catalytic activity without necessarily playing
any part in the catalytic process; it may, for example, be
essential for maintaining the active structure of the enzyme.
Nonetheless, identiﬁcation of the essential groups in an en-
zyme is an important step in characterizing the mechanism,
and many reagents are now available for modifying speciﬁc
types of residue. The logic used for interpreting such exper-
iments is often loose, though proper analytical approaches
have been available for a long time. Of these, the method of
Ray and Koshland is appropriate when the loss of activity can

readily be measured as a function of time, and Tsou’s method
is convenient when one lacks rate data but has information
on the amount of activity remaining at various degrees of
chemical modiﬁcation. These two approaches will now be
discussed.

of them is lost then all catalytic activity is lost, as illustrated
in Figure 7.2. If G1 is converted to an inactive form g1 with
ﬁrst-order rate constant k1 and G2 is converted to a (different)
inactive form g2 with ﬁrst-order rate constant k2 then the
activity A remaining after time t is given by
A = A0e−k1te−k2t = A0e−(k1+k2)t = A0e−kinactivationt
(7.8)
where A0 is the value of A at zero time, and kinactivation, the
observed ﬁrst-order rate constant for inactivation, is the sum
k1 + k2 of the rate constants for the separate reactions. Note

that the inactive forms produced in the ﬁrst steps may, and
probably do, react further with the same or different rate con-
stants, as indicated in the ﬁgure, but no knowledge of these
later processes or their rate constants is required, because all
activity has been assumed to be lost in the ﬁrst steps.
Although for simplicity Figure 7.2 is drawn with just two
essential groups, and equation 7.8 is written accordingly, it is
obvious from inspection that the same treatment can be gen-
eralized to any number of essential groups, and the observed
rate constant is then the sum of the rate constants for all the
individual processes. In practice, unless all the groups are of
a very similar kind we should expect considerable variations
in the values of the rate constants, and the slowest processes
will then make little contribution to the total, which will be
dominated by a small number of relatively rapid processes.
Returning to the case of two groups, suppose now that
they are both of the same chemical type (two cysteine residues,
for example) and that they both react with the modifying
reagent with the same rate constant k,2 but only one of them
is essential for catalytic activity: this might be the case, for ex-
ample, if one of them was in the active site of the enzyme and
the other was on the other side of the molecule. The model
is illustrated in Figure 7.3, and the observed rate constant is
now the same as the rate constant k, the equation for loss of
activity being as follows:
A = A0e−kt = A0e−kinactivationt
2Remember that the second qualiﬁcation does not follow automatically
from the ﬁrst: two or more groups may be of the same chemical type but
react with different rate constants, because the rate constants depend on the
environments of the groups and not just on their chemical identities.
7.5 Identifying essential groups
181
This result is again easy to generalize to the more realistic case
where there are many more than two groups sensitive to the
modifying agent and more than one of them is essential for
activity: with two essential groups, for example, the observed
rate constant is equal to 2k, and so on.
In addition to these simple cases, Ray and Koshland ex-
tended the analysis to more complex models in which mod-
iﬁcation of one group results in only partial loss of activity
(or no loss of activity at all), so that two or more groups
need to be modiﬁed for complete loss of activity. Such cases
may be recognized experimentally because the time course
for loss of activity does not follow ﬁrst-order kinetics; not
surprisingly, their analysis is more complicated than for the
two cases illustrated.

Remaining activity as a function of degree of
modiﬁcation

SOU CHEN-LU (1924–2007)
was for many years the
visible face of Chinese
biochemistry in the west, and
did much to promote the deve-
lopment of biochemistry in
China. After he obtained his
doctorate from Cambridge in
1951 he returned to China to
work in the Institute of Bio-
chemistry in Shanghai. Much
later he became head of the
Institute of Biophysics in
Peking. His paper in Scientia
Sinica discussed in this chapter
is a model that illustrates how
much can be achieved by an
isolated researcher working
with great intelligence but few
resources. He was elected to the
Chinese Academy of Sciences in
1980 and the Third World
Academy of Sciences in 1992.
The simplest case to consider in Tsou’s method is one in
which n groups on each monomeric enzyme molecule re-
act equally fast with the modifying agent, and nessential of
these are essential for catalytic activity. After modiﬁcation
of an average of nmodiﬁed groups on each molecule, the
probability that any particular group has been modiﬁed is
nmodiﬁed/n and the probability that it remains unmodiﬁed is
(1 −nmodiﬁed/n)nessential. For the enzyme molecule to retain
activity, all of its nessential groups must remain unmodiﬁed,
for which the probability is 1 −nmodiﬁed/n. Thus the frac-
tion f = A/A0 of activity remaining after modiﬁcation of
nmodiﬁed groups per molecule (with A and A0 deﬁned as in
Section 7.5.1) must be
§7.5.1, pages 180–181
f =

1 −nmodiﬁed
n
nessential
Hence
f 1/nessential = 1 −nmodiﬁed
n
and a plot of f 1/nessential against nmodiﬁed should be a straight
line. Initially, of course, one does not know what value of
nessential to use in the plot, so one plots f, f 1/2, f 1/3... in turn
against nmodiﬁed to decide which value gives the straightest
line.
One objection to this treatment is that not all of the modi-
ﬁcation reactions may be equally fast, and they may anyway
not be independent, as modiﬁcation of one group may alter
182
7. Tight-binding and Irreversible Inhibitors
the rates at which neighboring groups are modiﬁed. Tsou’s
paper should be consulted for a full discussion of these and
other complications, but two additional classes of group can
be accommodated without losing the essential simplicity of
the method. If there are nfast nonessential groups that react
rapidly compared with the essential groups, these will pro-
duce an initial region of the plot (regardless of nessential) in
which there is no decrease in f 1/nessential as nmodiﬁed increases.
Further groups, whether essential or not, that react slowly
compared with the fastest-reacting essential groups will not
become appreciably modiﬁed until most of the activity has
been lost; they must therefore be difﬁcult or impossible to
detect. In practice, therefore, a Tsou plot is likely to resemble
the one shown in Figure 7.4, which was used by Paterson
and Knowles as evidence that at least two carboxyl groups
are essential to the activity of pepsin, that three nonessential
groups were modiﬁed rapidly in their experiments, and that
the two essential groups belong to a class of ten that were
modiﬁed at similar rates.
In a more recent study, Moore
and co-workers used a Tsou plot to show that modiﬁcation
of just one group by diethyl pyrocarbonate was sufﬁcient to
inactivate dehydroquinase from Salmonella typhi.

Pepsin is a monomeric enzyme, but Tsou’s analysis can be
extended without difﬁculty to oligomeric enzymes, provided
that one can assume that the subunits react independently
with the modifying agent and that inactivation of one subunit
does not affect the activity of the others. With these assump-
tions, oligomeric enzymes can be treated in the same way as
monomeric enzymes, except that nessential is now the number
of essential groups per subunit, even though n, nmodiﬁed and
nfast are still deﬁned per molecule (see Norris and Brockle-
hurst).

On the other hand, if inactivation of one subunit does
cause inactivation of the others the whole oligomer must be
treated as one molecule.
For example, Li and co-workers

pepsin by trimethyloxonium ﬂuoroborate, a reagent that reacts speciﬁcally
with carboxyl groups.
The variable f represents the fraction of activity
remaining after modiﬁcation of the number of groups shown, and is raised
to the power 1/nessential, where nessential = 1, 2 or 3. The straight line observed
with nessential = 2 indicates that at least two carboxyl groups are essential to
the activity of pepsin, out of a total of 13 modiﬁed. The horizontal line at the
beginning of the plot indicates that there are three rapidly reacting groups
that are not needed for catalytic activity.

catalytic site. Modern genetic engineering techniques have
largely supplanted this approach, but it remains proﬁtable to
complement them with kinetic analysis of the properties of
the artiﬁcial mutants that can be produced. With a mutant
of known structure one can predict exactly how a Tsou plot
ought to be altered by a particular mutation, and experi-
mental veriﬁcation that it is in fact so altered is a way of
conﬁrming the correctness of the interpretation.
7.6
Inhibition as the basis of drug design
Most drugs in use at present are enzyme inhibitors, and of
these most were discovered by chance. The ﬁrst half of this
statement, illustrated in Table 7.3, is simply a commonplace
statement of the obvious; the second half is likely to be con-
tested, and I return to it shortly.
The list is not of course
exhaustive, and the proportions of different kinds of inhibitor
are not intended to have statistical signiﬁcance. Nonetheless,
184

the examples do illustrate two important points. Despite the
ease with which competitive inhibitors can be designed for
almost any enzyme, competitive inhibitors do not constitute
a majority of useful drugs. The reasons for this are touched
on in Section 13.3.4 and discussed more fully in Section 13.11.
§13.3.4, pages 338–341
§13.11, pages 373–377
In brief, dead-end inhibitors are normally studied in the
laboratory with controlled concentrations of substrates and
inhibitors and usually in the absence of products, and in these
conditions the different kinds of inhibitor may appear about
equally effective. In vivo, however, reaction ﬂuxes are stable
and difﬁcult to change, whereas metabolite concentrations are
very unstable. So to a ﬁrst approximation we can compare the
effectiveness of inhibitors in constant-rate conditions rather
than constant-concentration conditions, and then we ﬁnd that
the effect of competitive inhibition is easily resisted by the
system with moderate adjustment of the concentrations of
the substrates and products of the inhibited enzyme, whereas
similar adjustments tend to potentiate rather than counteract
the effects of uncompetitive inhibition (Figure 7.5). An excep-
tion to this may, however, arise if the substrate of the inhibited
enzyme is maintained at an essentially constant concentration
by homeostatic mechanisms: for example, competitive inhibi-
tion of an enzyme that uses glucose as substrate may well be
just as effective in vivo as it is in vitro, because the glucose
concentration will not increase to counteract the inhibition.

substrate concentration. In con-
trast, the effect of uncompeti-
tive inhibition is potentiated by
increases in substrate concentra-
tion. For more explanation, see
Section 13.3.4 (pages 338–341).
Another reason why reversible inhibitors in general are of-
ten disappointing as therapeutic agents is that most enzymes
have very little inﬂuence on the metabolic ﬂuxes through the
reactions they catalyze (for reasons that will be dealt with in
detail in Chapter 13), and so inhibiting them reversibly will
Chapter 13, pages 327–380
often have a negligible effect unless the degree of inhibition
is very high. That is why the types of inhibition discussed in
this chapter are typically more useful than those discussed
in Chapter 6.
A very low concentration of an irreversible

inhibitor or a tight-binding inhibitor may be sufﬁcient to elim-
inate an enzyme activity completely.
The other point that is obvious in Table 7.3 is that useful
remedies are often discovered by chance, or by making a
series of variations on molecules already known as traditional
remedies. Methyl salicylate (“oil of wintergreen”) was used
as an analgesic centuries before aspirin was derived from
it, and many years passed in which it was widely used as
a drug before there was any information about its mode of

included in Table 7.3 because it illustrates how chance conse-
quences of an imperfect understanding of biochemistry can
lead to valuable remedies. Urea has long been known to be
an effective protein denaturant at very high concentrations,
and this led to suggestions that it might decrease the ad-
hesion between hemoglobin molecules in sickle-cell disease.
Amazingly, this treatment proved effective, though Cerami
and Manning pointed out that it was therapeutically active at

drugs it would be very unlikely to be approved for therapeutic use today if
it had only just been discovered, because it is highly toxic to cats and, to a
lesser extent, dogs.

7. Tight-binding and Irreversible Inhibitors
Despite the disappointing results that have been obtained
with it, rational drug design, as it is optimistically called, has
been enthusiastically promoted for many years. The earliest
paper I can ﬁnd in which the complete phrase occurs was
written by Belleau more than 40 years ago, but the way in
which he used it—“Rational drug design ...thus remains a
mirage”—makes it clear that it was already a common phrase,
and that even then he was skeptical of the claims that were
being made. Despite the time that has passed since then it
remains remarkably difﬁcult to ﬁnd clear examples of useful
drugs that have been found by a rational process, though Vi-
gabatrin, used to treat epilepsy, probably qualiﬁes, and Finas-
teride, which is used to treat hypertrophy of the prostate, may
do so as well. Viagra, used for treating erectile dysfunction, is
sometimes claimed as a success for the approach, for example
by Kling, but this is little more than wishful thinking. It was

tension to angina to Viagra”

found, essentially by chance, when some patients in a trial
group for testing it as a potential drug for treating angina
(though originally intended to be a treatment for hyperten-
sion) reported unexpected symptoms, and the proportion of
“lost” samples that were not returned at the end of the trial
proved to be unusually high.
7.7
Delivering a drug to its target
The discussion in the previous section was limited to the effect
that an inhibitor acting as a drug has on its target enzyme,
and although that is arguably the only aspect that falls within
the scope of this book, it ignores an important aspect of
drug design, because it assumes that the inhibitor will reach
its target. This section will brieﬂy consider the question of
what makes an organic molecule “drug-like”: what are the
properties that make it likely that it will arrive inside a cell
after oral administration?
In an effort to answer this in a
general way Lipinski and co-workers proposed what is often

(1997) “Experimental and
computational approaches to
estimate solubility and perme-
ability in drug discovery and
development settings” Advanced
Drug Delivery Reviews 23, 3–25
called Lipinski’s rule of ﬁve:
1. Not too large: molecular mass less than 500 Da;
2. Not too lipophilic: calculated octanol-water partition
coefﬁcient of less than 105, that is to say the ratio of
partition at equilibrium between octanol and water;
3. Not too much hydrogen-bond forming capacity:
no
more than 5 hydrogen-bond donors, and no more than
10 hydrogen-bond acceptors.
7.7 Delivering a drug to its target
187
These properties may be understood as a summary of the
properties that allow a molecule to cross a biological mem-
brane by passive diffusion: it must be capable of moving
into the lipid phase from the aqueous phase, but it must not
dissolve so well in the lipid phase that it stays there. Lipinski
and co-workers realized at the outset, of course, that some
P. D. Dobson and D. B. Kell
(2008) “Carrier-mediated
cellular uptake of pharma-
ceutical drugs: an exception or
the rule?” Nature Reviews Drug
Discovery 7 205–220
successful drugs would be able to enter cells without passive
diffusion on account of structural similarities with the natural
substrates of transporters: these would thus constitute excep-
tions to the rule of ﬁve. Dobson and Kell, however, found that
such cases are by no means exceptional, and that transport
mediated by speciﬁc carriers is far more common than is
usually assumed. They note several implications of this for
drug design, among which that “drugs may be designed to
avoid speciﬁc tissues that lack carriers for them”. This should
allow much ﬁner control over drug behavior than is possible
on the hypothesis of passive diffusion.

how big would k1 have to be for this expression to be
signiﬁcantly different from the equilibrium ratio k−1/k1
assumed by Kitz and Wilson? What light do the typical
values of 106 M−1 · s−1 or greater for second-order rate

arranges enzymes in six classes,
of which three (EC 1–3) consist
mainly of enzymes with two
substrates and two products.
The totals shown refer to June

Much of the earlier part of this book has been concerned with
reactions of one substrate and one product. These are actually
rather rare (Figure 8.1), being conﬁned to isomerizations, such
as the interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-
phosphate, catalyzed by phosphoglucomutase. The develop-
ment of enzyme kinetics was greatly simpliﬁed by two facts,
however: many hydrolytic enzymes (about a quarter of the
total) can be treated as one-substrate enzymes, because the
second substrate, water, is always present in such large excess
that its concentration can be treated as a constant; secondly,
most enzymes behave much like single-substrate enzymes if
only one substrate concentration is varied, as will be clear
from the rate equations to be introduced in this chapter (see
Section 8.4.2 in particular). There are three principal steady-

state kinetic methods for elucidating the order of addition
of substrates and release of products: measurement of initial
rates in the absence of product; testing the nature of product
inhibition; and tracer studies with radioactively labeled sub-
strates. Initial rates and product inhibition will be discussed
in this chapter (and isotope exchange in Chapter 9), using a
general reaction with two substrates and two products as an
example:

are in the ﬁrst three classes (oxidoreductases, group-transfer
reactions, and hydrolases: Figure 8.1), all of which satisfy
equation 8.1. More complex reactions also occur, with four
or more substrates, but these can for the most part be studied
by generalizing the principles developed for the study of two-
substrate two-product reactions. Even equation 8.1 can take
place in many different ways, but I shall conﬁne discussion
to a small number of important cases, rather than attempt
an exhaustive treatment.

approach of this kind, but it is largely self-defeating, be-
cause nature can be relied upon to provide examples that fall
outside any such “exhaustive” treatment; more important,
readers who understand the methods used to discriminate
between the simple cases are well equipped to adapt them
to special experimental circumstances and to understand the
more detailed discussions found elsewhere.

A point that is perhaps worth emphasizing here, as it
is sometimes misunderstood, is that the distinction between
substrates and coenzymes, useful though it may be in physi-
ological studies, has no meaning in relation to enzyme mech-
anisms. In discussing the metabolic role of alcohol dehydro-
genase, for example, one often distinguishes between ethanol,
the “substrate”, and oxidized NAD, the “coenzyme”. So far as
studies of the enzyme are concerned they are both substrates;
neither is more fundamental than the other, and both are
required for the reaction to take place (Figure 8.2). As Figure
8.3 illustrates, a different view is appropriate in studies of
metabolism (Chapter 13).

normally reserved for enzymes in Class 2, group-transfer enzymes that are
neither oxidoreductases nor hydrolases.

nisms it is helpful to show this more explicitly than was done
in equation 8.1:
XG + Y ⇋X + GY
(8.2)
GX + Y ⇋X + GY
(8.3)
writing A as XG or GX and B as Y, so that one can see
that the reaction consists of transferring a group G from a
donor molecule3 XG or GX to an acceptor molecule Y. In
most cases the need to satisfy valence requirements will imply
that some other group is transferred simultaneously in the
opposite direction: for example, when a phosphoryl group
is transferred from ATP to glucose by hexokinase a proton is
transferred in the other direction and released into solution;
however, it is not usually necessary to show this reverse
transfer explicitly. The type of symbolism used in these equa-
tions was introduced by Wong and Hanes in a paper that

laid the foundations of the modern classiﬁcation of kinetic
mechanisms.
Although it is convenient for discussing the
mechanisms themselves it becomes cumbersome for writing
rate equations, and so I shall return to the use of single letters
later in this chapter.
Wong and Hanes showed how most reasonable mecha-
nisms of group transfer could be regarded as special cases
of a general mechanism. Perhaps fortunately, enzymes that
require the complete mechanism seem to be rare, and War-
ren and Tipton argued that some supposed examples, such
as pyruvate carboxylase, had probably been misinterpreted.
Accordingly, I shall discuss the three simplest group-transfer
mechanisms as separate cases.
3The reason for writing two different equations, with XG as donor in
equation 8.2, and GX in equation 8.3, will become evident when we consider
different ways in which the transfer can occur.

8. Reactions of More than One Substrate
The main division is between mechanisms that proceed
through a ternary complex, EXGY,4 so-called because it con-
tains the enzyme and both substrates in a single complex, and
those that proceed through a substituted enzyme, EG, which
contains the enzyme and the transferred group but neither of
the complete substrates. Early investigators, such as Woolf
and Haldane, assumed that the reaction would pass through
a ternary complex, and that this could be formed by way
of either of the two binary complexes EXG and EY. In other
words, the substrates could bind to the enzyme in random
order, as illustrated in Figure 8.4. The rigorous steady-state
equation for this mechanism is complex, and includes terms
in [GX]2 and [Y]2, but, as Gulbinsky and Cleland showed,

Wiley, Hoboken, New Jersey
Chapter 10, pages 253–271
Chapter 12, pages 281–325
the contribution of these terms to the rate may often be so
slight that the experimental rate equation is indistinguishable
from one derived on the assumption that all steps apart from
interconversion of the ternary complexes EXG·Y and EX·GY
are at equilibrium. If this assumption is made there are no
squared terms in the rate equation, and for simplicity I shall
make the rapid-equilibrium assumption in discussing this
mechanism.5 The step that interconverts EXG·Y and EX·GY
cannot be detected by steady-state measurements, but it is
logical to show it explicitly in the random-order mechanism
because it is treated as rate-determining in deriving the rate
equation.
Examination of Figure 8.4 will reveal no obvious reason
why, if XG and Y can bind simultaneously to the enzyme, and
X and GY can also bind simultaneously, X and Y cannot also
bind simultaneously. In other words there are various possi-
bilities for nonproductive binding that need to be considered in
a complete treatment, but to avoid making this chapter more
complicated than it needs to be we shall not consider these.
Similar complications can in principle arise with the other
mechanisms to be discussed.
4Ternary-complex mechanisms are sometimes called sequential mecha-
nisms, but this term is not very satisfactory, both because any mechanism
consists of a sequence of steps, and because it invites confusion with other
uses of the word.
5In his recent book Alberty argues that as rapid-equilibrium equations
are simpler than steady-state equations, and as they frequently describe the
observations just as well, they provide a better starting point for discussing
all kinds of mechanisms. In particular, many systems, including pH behavior
(Chapter 10) and mechanisms for enzyme regulation (Chapter 12) are simply
too complicated to analyze in terms of full steady-state equations, but can be
understood in terms of rapid-equilibrium equations.

the same as the random-order version shown in Figure 8.4 with some steps
omitted. To explain why these steps do not occur, that is to say why the
substrates must bind in a particular order, one may suppose that binding
of the ﬁrst substrate GX induces a conformational change that allows the
binding site for the second substrate Y to become recognizable.
It is now generally recognized that many enzymes cannot
be regarded as rigid templates, as implied by Figure 8.4.
Instead, it is likely that the conformations of both enzyme
and substrate are altered on binding, in accordance with
Koshland’s “induced-ﬁt” hypothesis (Section 12.4).

well happen therefore that no binding site exists on the en-
zyme for one of the two substrates until the other has bound.
In such cases, there is a compulsory order of binding, as
illustrated in Figure 8.5. If both substrates and products are
taken into consideration, four different orders are possible,
but the induced-ﬁt explanation of compulsory-order mech-
anisms leads us to expect that the reverse reaction should
be structurally analogous to the forward reaction, and that
the second product ought to be the structural analog of the
ﬁrst substrate; thus only two of the four possibilities are very
likely. In NAD-dependent dehydrogenases, for example, the
coenzymes are often found to be ﬁrst substrate and second
product.

Substituted-enzyme mechanisms

that the reaction catalyzed by sucrose glucosyltransferase pro-
ceeded via a substituted-enzyme intermediate rather than a
ternary complex.
Since then, studies with numerous and
diverse enzymes, including α-chymotrypsin, transaminases
and ﬂavoenzymes, have shown that the substituted-enzyme

mechanism,7 illustrated in Figure 8.6, is common and impor-
tant.
In the ordinary form of this mechanism, occurrence
of a ternary complex is structurally impossible because the
binding sites for X and Y are either the same or overlapping.
For example, aspartate transaminase catalyzes a reaction in-
volving four dicarboxylate anions of similar size:
glutamate +
E–pyridoxal ⇋· · · ⇋2-oxoglutarate +
E–pyridoxamine
oxaloacetate +
E–pyridoxamine ⇋· · · ⇋aspartate +
E–pyridoxal
(8.4)
Here E–pyridoxal represents the enzyme with its coen-
zyme as pyridoxal phosphate,8 and E–pyridoxamine repre-
sents the form with pyridoxamine phosphate.
As all four
reactants are structurally similar (Figure 8.7), it is reasonable
to expect the binding sites for 2-oxoglutarate and oxaloacetate
(X and Y in the general case) to be virtually identical and the
second half of the reaction to be essentially the reverse of the
ﬁrst half.
In this mechanism, the substrates can often bind to the
“wrong” forms of the enzyme, so that, for example, in equa-

The chemical mechanisms of

one thus expects to see substrate inhibition at high substrate

transferred group (E in Figure 8.6) can almost always bind the
reactants that also do not contain it (X and Y).

mechanism.

by condensation with a lysine residue (Figure 8.8), but that is not important
for the present purpose.
8.2 Classiﬁcation of mechanisms
195
The substituted-enzyme mechanism shown in Figure 8.6 is
also a compulsory-order mechanism, but this is less notewor-
thy than with ternary-complex mechanisms because there is
only one mechanistically reasonable order, and no random-
order alternative: even if X and Y bind to E, there is no
reasonable way for the resulting complexes to break down to
give GX or GY. The kinetic properties of the random-order
substituted-enzyme mechanism, as well other mechanisms
that make little chemical sense, can of course be analyzed,
but it is not necessary to consider these.
The methods of
Chapter 5 can be applied to unreasonable as easily as to rea-
Chapter 5, pages 107–132
sonable mechanisms, and if one regards kinetics as a branch
of algebra, largely unrelated to chemistry, one risks having to
deal with a bewildering array of possibilities. For this reason
one should always regard algebra as the servant of enzyme
kinetics and not its master.
8.2.3
Comparison between chemical and kinetic
classiﬁcations

atic substitution mechanism”

on the Mechanism of Enzyme
Action (edited by W. D. McElroy
and B. Glass), Johns Hopkins
Press, Baltimore
In a substituted-enzyme mechanism the group G is trans-
ferred twice, ﬁrst from the substrate GX to the free enzyme
E, then from the substituted enzyme EG to the second sub-
strate Y. For this reason Koshland introduced the term double-
displacement reaction for this type of mechanism, shown in
Figure 8.9.

Conversely, ternary-complex mechanisms, in which G is
transferred only once, are single-displacement reactions (Figure
8.10).
This terminology is still sometimes used, especially

in nonkinetic contexts.
It leads naturally to consideration
of the stereochemistry of group-transfer reactions, which is
discussed in detail by Koshland and forms the subject of
Problem 8.1 at the end of this chapter.
The essential idea is that each substitution at a chiral cen-
ter (usually a carbon or phosphorus atom) results in inversion
of conﬁguration at that center. Thus one expects a ternary-
complex mechanism to result in inversion of conﬁguration,
but a substituted-enzyme mechanism to result in retention of
conﬁguration (as two inversions regenerate the original con-
ﬁguration). For example, studies by Pollard-Knight and co-

workers of liver hexokinase D by nuclear magnetic resonance
showed that it catalyzed phosphoryl transfer with inversion
of conﬁguration at phosphorus, in agreement with kinetic evi-
dence that the reaction follows a ternary-complex mechanism.
Similar stereochemistry has been found with other kinases
196

believed to follow ternary-complex mechanisms, but nucleo-
side diphosphate kinase provides a signiﬁcant exception: not
only did Garcés and Cleland ﬁnd that the reaction has the
typical kinetics of a substituted-enzyme mechanism, but Sheu
and co-workers later found that it proceeds with retention of
conﬁguration.

However, a ternary-complex mechanism is not the only
way to explain inversion of conﬁguration: as Spector pointed
out, one is not the only odd number, and the stereochemical
evidence usually advanced in support of single-displacement
mechanisms is just as consistent with mechanisms involving
three (or ﬁve, seven, and so on) displacements. Moreover, the
triple-displacement mechanism was proved beyond reason-
able doubt for acetate kinase.
At one time it seemed possible to express experi-
mental results in terms of some broad generalizations,
for example, that kinases followed random-order ternary-

complex mechanisms, NAD-dependent dehydrogenases fol-
lowed compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanisms (with
oxidized NAD as ﬁrst substrate and reduced NAD as second
product), and transaminases followed substituted-enzyme
mechanisms. This sort of classiﬁcation is not wholly wrong,
and it can give a useful guide to what to expect when study-
ing a new enzyme, but it is certainly oversimpliﬁed.
For
example, alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver was once
regarded as an archetypal example of an enzyme obeying
a compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism, but Hanes
and co-workers found that it binds its substrates in a random
order but releases the products in a compulsory order.

the strictest sense compulsory-order ternary-complex mech-
anisms may not occur at all, as a small degree of randomness
is difﬁcult to detect, but they remain useful as a basis for
discussion.
It is important to realize that the sequence of events sug-
gested by kinetic studies, as discussed later in this chapter,
does not have to agree with the chemical mechanism, the
actual sequence of events in the catalytic site.
Kinetically
speaking, a ternary-complex mechanism means that both sub-
strates must remain associated with the enzyme before the
ﬁrst product is released, but it is perfectly possible for the ﬁrst
product to be released only after the second substrate arrives
even if the reaction proceeds through a substituted enzyme.
Although this does not seem likely for a transaminase type of
reaction as shown in equation 8.4, where the four reactants are
so similar that one expects them all to bind at the same site,
8.2 Classiﬁcation of mechanisms
197
it is not easy to exclude it when the transferred group is large
and the four reactants are quite different from one another.
Although the operation of a substituted-enzyme mecha-
nism can often be shown on the basis of positive evidence,
such as isolation of the putative substituted-enzyme interme-
diate (something easily done for many transaminases), op-
eration of a ternary-complex mechanism is usually deduced
on the basis of negative evidence, such as failure to isolate
a substituted enzyme.
Spector argues that this is always
true (not just usually). As noted above, he points out that
stereochemical evidence for a ternary-complex mechanism is
just as consistent with a triple-displacement mechanism, and
he argues that the claim that one displacement is “simpler”
than three or ﬁve is naive. Many tasks in everyday life are
made simpler to achieve by breaking them up into several
smaller tasks than by attempting a once-for-all solution, and
it is quite likely that this is also true of enzyme chemistry (it is
certainly true of metabolic pathways, in which difﬁcult tasks,
such as coupling the oxidation of palmitate to the synthesis
of ATP, are always handled as sequences of simpler ones). It
would be misleading to suggest that Spector’s thesis has been
generally accepted; in reality it has been met mainly with
indifference or hostility, but there are no strong reasons for
rejecting it.
8.2.4
Schematic representation of mechanisms
As noted already, the system of writing the substrates in a
group-transfer reaction as GX and Y, and the products as
X and GY, is convenient for making the transferred group
explicit and for discussing chemical aspects of mechanisms, it
is less convenient for writing rate equations; in the remainder
of this chapter we shall therefore return to representing the
substrates as A, B, C... and the products as P, Q, R....
A schematic way of representing mechanism devised by
Cleland is often used for reactions of two or more substrates.

(1930–) was born in
Baltimore, but after postdoctor-
al research at the University of
Chicago he has spent virtually
all of his career at the Univers-
ity of Wisconsin. He has been
very inﬂuential in the classiﬁca-
tion and analysis of mechan-
isms for reactions of more than
one substrate. His computer
programs for analyzing
experimental data brought
statistical methods to a wide
audience. He has made
important contributions to the
study of kinetic isotope effects
in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
He was also the ﬁrst to propose
the use of dithiothreitol (Figure
8.13) for the protection of
sulfhydryl groups in proteins.
The various forms of the enzyme are written below a hori-
zontal line, and vertical arrows are used to represent addition
of substrates and release of products. The compulsory-order
ternary-complex mechanism for a two-substrate reaction (Fig-
ure 8.5) is drawn as shown in Figure 8.11, and the substituted-
enzyme mechanism (Figure 8.6) is drawn as shown in Figure
8.12. This system provides a tidy and clear way of showing
compulsory-order mechanisms (even for more complicated
examples than those shown here, as illustrated below in Fig-
198
8. Reactions of More than One Substrate
ures 8.34–36), and is widely used for this purpose. However,
it is cumbersome to incorporate branches or other complexi-
ties, and does not readily lend itself to unambiguous inclusion
of rate constants in the diagram. It is also somewhat unsatis-
factory for considering reverse reactions, because then each
arrow needs to be read backwards, a downward-pointing
arrow representing an upward-proceeding step, and so on.
8.3
Rate equations
8.3.1
Compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism
Steady-state kinetic measurements have proved to be of great
value for distinguishing between the various reaction mech-
anisms for group-transfer reactions.
The development of
these methods was a considerable task, on account of the
large number of possibilities and the relatively small kinetic
differences between them. Segal and co-workers were among
the ﬁrst to recognize the need for a systematic approach, and
derived the equations for several mechanisms. Subsequently,
Alberty and Dalziel9 made major advances in the understand-
ing of group-transfer reactions, and introduced most of the
methods described in this chapter.

As all steady-state methods for distinguishing between
mechanisms depend on differences between the complete rate
equations, it is appropriate to give a brief account of these
equations before discussing methods. The equation for the
compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism will be given
ﬁrst as it was derived in Section 5.3 as an illustration of the
§5.3, pages 113–116
general method for deriving rate equations, and it had the
following form (equation 5.9):
v =
e0(N1ab −N−1pq)
D0 + D1a + D2b + D3p + D4q + D5ab + D6ap
+ D7bq + D8pq + D9abp + D10bpq
(8.5)
This equation contains 13 coefﬁcients, but these were deﬁned
in terms of only eight rate constants, so there must be rela-
tionships between the coefﬁcients that are not explicit in the
equation. Moreover, the coefﬁcients lack obvious mechanistic
meaning.
Numerous systems have been used for rewriting rate
equations in more meaningful terms; the one used in this

OBERT A. ALBERTY
(1921–) contributed to
most of the topics
discussed in this book, and
these notes could appropriately
have appeared in almost any
chapter. He was born in Win-
ﬁeld, Kansas, and studied
chemical engineering and then
chemistry as an undergraduate
at the University of Nebraska,
and as a graduate student at the
University of Wisconsin, where
his doctoral research was con-
cerned with the electrophor-
esis of γ-globulins. He joined
the faculty at Wisconsin in 1947,
and, from the 1950s, became
especially interested in enzyme
kinetics, and carried out much
of the ﬁrst work on reactions of
two substrates. Between 1967
and 1982 his research was
interrupted while he was Dean
of Science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, but he
restarted research as energet-
ically as ever, ﬁrst working on
the thermodynamics of petrole-
um components, and returned
to enzymology in 1991. He
never retired from scientiﬁc
research, and is still writing
papers and books. He became a
co-author of the major textbook
Physical Chemistry in 1955, and
has followed it through many
subsequent editions.
Michaelis constant KmA for a substrate A corresponds to Km
in a single-substrate reaction, and an inhibition constant KiA is
related to the Kic and Kiu values obtained when the substrate
A is used as a product inhibitor of the reverse reaction (but is
not necessarily identical to either of them). In some circum-
stances the inhibition constants are true substrate-dissociation
constants, and when this is the case one can emphasize the
fact by using symbols such as KsA rather than KiA, and so on.
If actual enzyme concentrations are known the limiting rates
can be converted into catalytic constants, and the deﬁnition
of speciﬁcity constants follows likewise in a natural way from
the deﬁnition for single-substrate reactions (Section 2.4).
Equation 8.5 takes the following form in this system:

and comparison with the deﬁnitions given next to equa-
tion 5.9 shows that the kinetic parameters must have the val-
ues given in Table 8.1.11 Although this equation may appear
complex, it contains more regularities than are obvious at ﬁrst
sight. The terms that contain q are in general similar to those
that contain a, whereas those that contain p are similar to
those that contain b, and that of course is what we should
expect from inspection of the mechanism, as A is the ﬁrst
substrate in the forward direction, and Q is the ﬁrst substrate
in the reverse direction, whereas B and P are the second
substrates in the two directions.
Theorell and Chance suggested that alcohol dehydro-
genase followed a limiting case of the compulsory-order

KiB to be substituted for one of the other constants.

conversion to P and release of P occur in a single step, as
illustrated in Figure 8.14.
Returning to equation 8.6, it does, of course, satisfy the
usual dimensional requirements (Section 1.3), but one can go
§1.3, pages 9–10
further than this by ignoring, for the moment, that all the con-
centrations, Michaelis constants and inhibition constants have
the same dimensions: if a, KmA and KiA have special A di-
mensions, and b, KmB and KiB have (different) B dimensions,
then even by this more restricted deﬁnition all the terms in the
denominator are dimensionless; whatever reactants appear in
the numerator of any term, whether as concentrations or as
subscripts, also appear in the denominator. Although a and b
will normally be measured in the same units and will have
the same dimensions, so that KmA, KiA and KmB will have
the same dimensions, this is not necessarily always true. For
example, if a is a concentration measured in mM, then KmA
and KiA must also be measured in mM, whereas if B is a gas
rather than a dissolved metabolite it might be convenient to
represent its concentration b as a partial pressure measured in
Pa, and in this case KmB and KiB would also need to be treated
as partial pressures measured in Pa.

with no terms in ap, bq, abp or bpq. It is perhaps surprising
that the simpler equation should refer to the more compli-
cated mechanism; the explanation is that equation 8.7, un-
like equation 8.6, was derived with the assumption that all
steps apart from interconversion of the ternary complexes
EAB and EPQ are at equilibrium, an assumption that causes
many terms, including all terms in squared concentrations,
to vanish from the equation. With this assumption, KiA, KiB,
KiP and KiQ are the dissociation constants of EA, EB, EP and
EQ respectively; KmA is the dissociation constant for release
of A from EAB, KmB is that for release of B from EAB, KmP
is that for release of P from EPQ, and KmQ is that for release

These substitutions cannot be made in equation 8.6 because the compulsory-

reason for the greater complexity of equation 8.6.

where the kinetic parameters are again deﬁned in Table 8.1.
In coefﬁcient form this equation is the same as equation 8.6
without the constant 1 and the terms in abp and bpq in the
denominator, but the relationships between the parameters
are different, and equation 8.8 has KiPKmQ wherever KmPKiQ
might be expected by analogy with equation 8.6. As we shall
see, the lack of the constant in the denominator produces
easily observable behavior.
8.3.4
Haldane relationships
As discussed in Section 2.7.2, the parameters of the Michaelis–
§2.7.2, pages 58–59
Menten equation are not all independent of one another be-
cause they are constrained by the Haldane relationship to
satisfy the equilibrium constant of the overall reaction. This
is equally true for reactions of more than one substrate or
product. One Haldane relationship for the compulsory-order
ternary-complex mechanism is obvious from inspection of the
numerator of equation 8.6:
Keq = V+KmPKiQ
V−KiAKmB
There is also a second that is less obvious but is easily checked
with the aid of the deﬁnitions in Table 8.1:
Keq = V2+KiPKmQ
V2−KmAKiB
There is again one obvious relationship for the substituted-
enzyme mechanism, together with three that are less obvious
but again, easy to conﬁrm:
Keq = KiPKiQ
KiAKiB
= V+KiPKmQ
V−KiAKmB
= V+KmPKiQ
V−KmAKiB
= V2+KmPKmQ
V2−KmAKmB
8.3 Rate equations
203
Cleland derived these relationships, as well as many oth-
ers for other mechanisms. In principle they can be used as a
means of distinguishing between mechanisms, but in practice
they have not been extensively used for that.
Their major
value is for checking whether the parameter values obtained
when analyzing experimental results are consistent with the
equilibrium constant.

8.3.5
Calculation of rate constants from kinetic
parameters
Although Table 8.1 shows how the kinetic parameters of the
two compulsory-order mechanisms can be expressed in terms
of rate constants, it does not give the inverse relationships.
For the substituted-enzyme mechanism no unique inverse
relationship exists, so it is not possible to calculate the rate
constants from measurements of kinetic parameters, because
there are inﬁnitely many different sets of rate constants capa-
ble of generating the same parameters. For the compulsory-

k4 = V−KiQ/KmQe0
k−4 = V−/KmQe0
order ternary-complex mechanism a unique relationship does
exist, and those derived by Cleland are listed in the margin.
These relationships should be used with caution, however,
because they assume that the simplest form of the mecha-
nism applies, in other words they make no allowance for the
possibility that the mechanism may contain more than the
minimum number of steps. If any of the binary or ternary
complexes isomerize, the form of the steady-state rate equa-
tion is unaffected, but the interpretation of the parameters is
different and some or all of the expressions become invalid.
For the random-order ternary-complex mechanism it is
obvious that none of the rate constants apart from those
for the rate-limiting interconversion of ternary complexes
can be determined from steady-state measurements if the
rapid-equilibrium assumption is correct (because as soon as
one makes a rapid-equilibrium assumption one gives up
the possibility of getting any rate information about the
steps assumed to be at equilibrium). However, if the rapid-
equilibrium assumption is not made, and there are detectable
deviations from equation 8.7, it may be possible to use curve-
ﬁtting techniques to deduce information about the rate con-
stants, as discussed by Cornish-Bowden and Wong.

products
8.4.1
Meanings of the parameters
If no products are included in the reaction mixture, the equa-
tion for the initial rate for a reaction following the compulsory-
order ternary-complex mechanism is obtained from equa-
tion 8.6 by omitting all terms containing p or q:
v =
Vab
KiAKmB
1 +
a
KiA
+
KmAb

+
ab
KiAKmB
This can be given a tidier appearance by multiplying all terms
by KiAKmB:
v =
Vab
KiAKmB + KmBa + KmAb + ab
(8.9)
The meanings of the Michaelis constants come from con-
sideration of how the equation simpliﬁes if only one substrate
concentration is large whereas the other remains moderate.
For example, if b is large enough for terms that do not con-
tain it to be negligible, then equation 8.9 simpliﬁes to the
Michaelis–Menten equation in terms of A, with KmA as the
Michaelis constant:
v =
Vab
✘✘✘✘
KiAKmB +✘✘✘
KmBa + KmAb + ab =
Va
KmA + a
Thus KmA is deﬁned as the limiting Michaelis constant for A
when B is saturating. An exactly parallel argument shows
that KmB is the Michaelis constant for B when A is saturating.
More generally, for a mechanism with an arbitrary number of
substrates, the Michaelis constant for any substrate is deﬁned
as the limiting Michaelis constant for that substrate when
all other substrates are at saturation. KiA is not the same as
KmA, and its meaning can be seen by considering the effect on
equation 8.9 of making b very small (but not zero13), so that
although the numerator remains nonzero all terms in b in the
denominator are negligible:
v =
Vab
KiAKmB + KmBa +✘✘✘
KmAb +✚
✚
ab =
 Vb
KmB

a
KiA + a
13We must not make it zero, because this would just give v = 0, whereas
we are interested in the form of the equation as b approaches zero.
8.4 Initial-rate measurements in the absence of products
205
We can further deﬁne a speciﬁcity constant for B, as kB =
kcat/KmB and the equation then becomes
v = (kBb) e0a
KiA + a
The speciﬁcity constant for A is deﬁned similarly as kA =
kcat/KmA. It follows that KiA is the true equilibrium disso-
ciation constant of EA, because when b approaches zero the
rate of reaction of B with EA must also approach zero; there
is then nothing to prevent binding of A to E to establish equi-
librium and the Michaelis–Menten assumption of equilibrium
binding is valid in this instance. KiB does not appear in equa-
tion 8.9, because B does not bind to the free enzyme. It does,
however, occur in the equation for the complete reversible
reaction, equation 8.6, and its magnitude affects the behavior
of B as an inhibitor of the reverse reaction. Although equa-
tion 8.9 is not symmetrical in A and B, because KiAKmB is not
the same as KmAKiB, it is symmetrical in form; measurement
of initial rates in the absence of products does not therefore
distinguish A from B, and does not allow a conclusion as to
which substrate binds ﬁrst.
It is interesting to examine the deﬁnitions of the speciﬁcity
constants in the simplest form of the substituted-enzyme
mechanism. It follows from the deﬁnitions in Table 8.1 that

the speciﬁcity constant for A may be expressed in terms of
rate constants as follows:
kA =

k−1 + k2
This deﬁnition only includes rate constants from the half-
reaction that involves A; the rate constants for the steps in-
volving B are absent. The speciﬁcity constant for B is like-
wise independent of the steps that involve A. In principle,
therefore, we should expect that if B is replaced by an analog
B′ whose corresponding reaction with A is catalyzed by the
same enzyme the value of kA should be unchanged. West-
ley and co-workers carried out the appropriate tests with
several enzymes, ascorbate oxidase, aspartate transaminase,
nucleoside-5′-diphosphate kinase and rhodanese, with re-
sults that were usually not in accordance with this predic-

thoroughly investigated enzymes that follow a substituted-
enzyme mechanism, and sometimes regarded as the archety-
pal example, did behave in the expected way, but the other
enzymes studied by the same group do not. Other authors,

such as Morpeth and Massey, have sometimes taken variation
of kA with the identity of B as evidence that a substituted-
enzyme mechanism cannot apply.
However, if the results
from Westley and co-workers have general validity this sort
of conclusion is not safe.
How can we explain the discrepancy? Does it imply that
the relationships in Table 8.1 have been incorrectly derived,
or that there is an error in the assumptions made for analyz-
ing them? Westley and co-workers argue that the error lies
in the implied assumption that exactly the same substituted
enzyme, with the same kinetic properties, is produced regard-
less of the half-reaction that has generated it. They consider
that the enzyme retains some conformational “memory” of
the reaction it has undergone, sufﬁciently long lived to affect
its kinetic properties in the next reaction that it undergoes.15
M
YRON LEE BENDER
(1924–1988) was born
and grew up in St
Louis, Missouri. He obtained
his doctorate at Purdue, and
after periods in various depart-
ments he settled at North-
western University (Urbana,
Illinois). During the period
when the study of enzyme
mechanisms meant the study of
the mechanism of α-chymotryp-
sin, he did more than anyone to
place this on a sound chemical
basis. For the ﬁrst time it was
possible to discuss enzyme
mechanisms on the same terms
as the mechanisms of organic
reactions.
We do not need to analyze this idea thoroughly here; the
important point is that the models of enzyme behavior given
in textbooks are commonly based on the simplest possible
cases, but real enzymes may often behave in more compli-
cated ways.
This does not mean that simple models are
useless, but only that they should be regarded as starting
points for analyzing enzyme mechanisms and not as complete
descriptions of them.
Comparison of kcat values for different substrates of an
enzyme that follows a substituted-enzyme mechanism may
also provide valuable information. For example, Zerner and
co-workers found that the ethyl, methyl and p-nitrophenyl

esters of N-acetyltryptophan all had similar kcat values in
chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis, despite having Km val-
ues varying over about a ﬁfty-fold range, whereas the corre-
sponding amide substrate, N-acetyltryptophanamide, had a
much smaller kcat value. They interpreted these results (and
the similar ones for derivatives of phenylalanine) to mean that
the constancy of kcat for the esters meant that a step identical
for the three substrates, and thus occurring after loss of the
alcohols that made them different from one another, was suf-
ﬁciently slow that it largely accounted for the overall kinetics.
This step was presumably the hydrolysis of the acetyltrypto-

phanylenzyme intermediate (commonly called “deacylation”
in studies of chymotrypsin and similar enzymes). The differ-
ent value for the amides was accounted for by supposing that
with amide substrates the initial formation of the acetyltryp-
tophanylenzyme intermediate (“acylation”) was much slower
than with ester substrates.

8.4.2
Apparent Michaelis–Menten parameters
If the concentration of one substrate is varied at a constant
(but not necessarily very high or very low) concentration of
the other, equation 8.9 still has the form of the Michaelis–
Menten equation with respect to the varied substrate.
For
example, if a is varied at constant b, terms that do not contain
a are constant, and equation 8.9 can be rearranged into the
following form:
v =

Vb
KmB + b

a
KiAKmB + KmAb
KmB + b

+ a
=
Vappa
Kapp

in which the apparent values of the Michaelis–Menten param-
eters are functions of b:
Vapp =
Vb
KmB + b
(8.10)

= KiAKmB + KmAb
KmB + b
(8.11)
Vapp
Kapp
m


b
KiAKmB

(8.12)
Notice that the expressions for Vapp and Vapp/Kapp
m
(but not
the expression for Kapp
m ) are themselves of Michaelis–Menten
form with respect to b: this will be used later for constructing
secondary plots (Section 8.4.4).
§8.4.4, page 209
This reduction of equation 8.9 to the Michaelis–Menten
equation with apparent parameters is a particular case of a
more general kind of behavior with wide implications for
enzymology.
It means that even if a reaction actually has
two or more substrates it can be treated as a single-substrate
reaction if only one substrate concentration is varied at a time.
This explains why the analysis of single-substrate reactions
208
8. Reactions of More than One Substrate
continued to be an essential component of all steady-state
kinetic analysis even after it was realized that most enzymes
have more than one substrate.
8.4.3
Primary plots for ternary-complex mechanisms
A typical experiment to characterize a reaction that follows
equation 8.9 involves several sub-experiments, each at a dif-
ferent value of b, each treated as a single-substrate experiment
in which apparent Michaelis–Menten parameters are deter-
mined by measuring the rate as a function of a. Any of the
plots discussed in Section 2.6 can be used for this purpose, the
only difference from the single-substrate case being that they
yield apparent rather than real parameters, and such a plot
is called a primary plot, to distinguish it from the secondary
plots discussed in Section 8.4.4. In the text I shall refer only to
the appearance of plots of a/v against a (seen in Figure 8.15
for a representative case), but the other plots (1/v against 1/a
in Figure 8.16; v against v/a in Figure 8.17) will also be illus-
trated, for comparison and for the use of readers who prefer
these plots. All these ﬁgures are drawn on the assumption
that equation 8.9 is obeyed.

In Figure 8.15 the lines intersect at a unique point at which
a = −KiA, a/v = (KmA −KiA)/V. This intersection point
must occur at the left of the a axis (because −KiA must be
negative), but may be above or below the a/v axis depending
on the relative magnitudes of KiA and KmA (contrast the plot
with the substituted-enzyme mechanism, Figure 8.21 in Sec-
tion 8.4.5). These coordinates give the value of KiA directly,
but determination of the other parameters requires additional
plots of the apparent parameters, as discussed in Section 8.4.4.
The primary plots are qualitatively the same (with a and A
replaced by b and B throughout) when b is varied at various
values of a.
For the rapid-equilibrium random-order ternary-complex
mechanism, the complete rate equation (equation 8.7) also
simpliﬁes to equation 8.9 if terms in p and q are omitted. Thus
the primary plots are the same as for the compulsory-order
mechanism, and it is impossible to tell from measurements of
the initial rate in the absence of products whether there is a
compulsory order of binding of substrates.

Secondary plots
As equations 8.10 and 8.12 have the form of the Michaelis–
Menten equation, it follows that plots of Vapp or Vapp/Kapp
m
against b describe rectangular hyperbolas through the origin
and that they can be analyzed by the usual plots, which are
now called secondary plots or replots as they represent further
processing of the apparent parameters obtained from the pri-
mary plots. For example, the slopes of the primary plots of

a/v against a (or the ordinate intercepts of the plots of 1/v
against 1/a) provide values of 1/Vapp, whose expression can
be found by writing equation 8.10 as follows:
1
Vapp = 1

so a plot of 1/Vapp against 1/b is a straight line of slope
KmB/V and intercept 1/V on the 1/Vapp axis (Figure 8.18).
A different secondary plot may be made by plotting
Kapp
m /Vapp, the ordinate intercepts of the plots of a/v against
a (or slopes of the plots of 1/v against 1/a) against 1/b. The
expression for the line can be found by writing equation 8.12
as follows:
Kapp

Vapp = KmA

Thus the plot gives a straight line of slope KiAKmB/V and
intercept KmA/V on the Kapp
m /Vapp axis as shown in Figure
8.19. All four parameters of equation 8.9, V, KiA, KmA and
KmB, can readily be calculated from these plots.
The equation for Kapp
m , equation 8.11, also describes a
rectangular hyperbola, as shown in Figure 8.20, but the curve
does not pass through the origin. Instead Kapp
m
approaches
KiA as b approaches zero (and KmA as b becomes very large,
as already discussed).
It is thus a three-parameter hyper-
bola, and cannot be redrawn as a straight line. As in other
cases, Kapp
m
is a less convenient parameter to examine than
Kapp
m /Vapp.
One can equally well treat B as the variable substrate
instead of A, making primary plots of b/v against b at the
different values of a; indeed, until it is known which substrate
binds ﬁrst it is arbitrary which is designated A and which B.
The analysis is the same, and so there is no need to describe
it again. The only important difference is that KiB does not
occur in equation 8.9, and KiAKmB/KmA occurs wherever KiB
might be expected from simple interchange of A and B.

Plots for the substituted-enzyme mechanism
For the substituted-enzyme mechanism, the initial rate in the
absence of products is as follows:
v =
Vab
KmBa + KmAb + ab
(8.13)
The most striking feature of this equation is the absence of
a constant from the denominator. (Problem 5.5 at the end of
Chapter 5 explores why this should be so). It causes behavior
recognizably different from that seen with ternary-complex
mechanisms when either substrate concentration is varied:
for example, if a is varied at a constant value of b, the apparent
values of the Michaelis–Menten parameters are as follows:
Vapp =
Vb
KmB + b

Although equation 8.14 is identical to equation 8.10, equa-

unlike equation 8.12, shows no dependence on b.

What this means is that only Vapp behaves in the same
way as in ternary-complex mechanisms, and the important
characteristic is that Vapp/Kapp
m
is independent of b, with a
constant value of V/KmA. It is also constant if b is varied at
different values of a, and its value is then V/KmB. Primary
plots of a/v against a form series of straight lines intersecting
on the a/v axis, as shown in Figure 8.21. The pattern is easily
distinguishable from that given by ternary-complex mecha-
nisms (Figure 8.15) unless KiA is much smaller than KmA.
The corresponding plots of 1/v against 1/a are illustrated
in Figure 8.22, and those of v against v/a in Figure 8.23.
The primary plots are qualitatively the same (with a and A
replaced by b and B throughout) when b is varied at various
values of a instead of vice versa.
The secondary plot of 1/Vapp against 1/b (Figure 8.24)
has the same slope and intercepts as the corresponding plot
for the ternary-complex mechanisms, and, not surprisingly,
therefore, it looks exactly the same (compare Figure 8.18). The
secondary plot of Kapp
m /Vapp against 1/b is not needed for
8.5 Substrate inhibition
211
parameter estimation, as the only parameter that it provides,
KmA/V, is already known from the primary plots. However,
it still has some use for illustrative purposes, to conﬁrm that
Kapp
m /Vapp is indeed independent of b.

Why substrate inhibition occurs

only at low substrate concentrations because, in all reasonable
mechanisms, at least one of the four reactants can bind to
the wrong form of the enzyme. In the substituted-enzyme
mechanism, the substrate and product that lack the trans-
ferred group (Y and X respectively in the symbolism used in
Section 8.2) can be expected to bind to the wrong form of the
free enzyme; in the random-order ternary-complex mecha-
nism, the same pair may bind to the wrong binary complexes;
and, in the compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism,
either the second substrate or the ﬁrst product may bind to the
wrong binary complex. In this last case, substrate inhibition
can occur in either the forward or the reverse reaction, but
not in both, because only one of the two binary complexes
is available. For convenience, I shall take B as the reactant
that displays substrate inhibition for each mechanism, but
the results can readily be transposed for other reactants if
required.
8.5.2
Compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism
The nonproductive complex EBQ in the compulsory-order
ternary-complex mechanism was considered in Section 5.7.3.
It can be allowed for in the rate equation by multiplying every
denominator term that refers to EQ by (1 + k5b/k−5), where
k−5/k5) is the dissociation constant of EBQ.

According to the relative amounts of these
two complexes in the steady state, KsiB may approximate to

in this mechanism is not necessarily detectable at any attain-
able concentration of B.

only at high concentrations of A, so it is potentiated by A

of b/v against b are parabolic, with a common intersection
point at b = −KiAKmB/KmA. Primary plots of a/v against

a are linear, but have no common intersection point. These
plots are illustrated in Figure 8.26. They are quite different
from one another and so, unlike Figure 8.15 (reproduced here
as Figure 8.27) for the kinetics without substrate inhibition,
they produce a clear distinction between the two substrates.
8.5.3
Random-order ternary-complex mechanism
In the random-order ternary-complex mechanism, the con-
centration of EQ is zero in the absence of added Q if the rapid-
equilibrium assumption holds. As B cannot bind to a species
that is not present, substrate inhibition does not occur with
this mechanism unless Q is added. If the rapid-equilibrium
assumption does not hold, there is no reason why substrate
inhibition should not occur, but its nature cannot easily be
predicted, because of the complexity of the rate equation. In
this mechanism, EBQ is not a dead-end complex, because it
can be formed from either EB or EQ, and need not therefore
be in equilibrium with either.
8.5.4
Substituted-enzyme mechanism
In the substituted-enzyme mechanism, the nonproductive
complex EB results from binding of B to E (or binding of Y to
E in the symbolism of Section 8.2). It is a dead-end complex,
and so it can be allowed for by multiplying terms that refer
to E in the denominator of the rate equation by (1 + b/KsiB),
where KsiB is the dissociation constant of EB. Equation 8.13
therefore takes the following form:
v =

Inhibition according to this equation is most effective when
a is small, and thus it resembles competitive inhibition. Pri-
mary plots of b/v against b are parabolic and intersect at a
common point on the b/v axis, in other words at b = 0.

the absence of substrate inhibition in Figure 8.29 (the same as
Figure 8.21) for comparison.
8.5.5
Diagnostic value of substrate inhibition
Substrate inhibition may at ﬁrst sight seem a tiresome com-
plication in the analysis of kinetic data. Actually, it is usefully
informative, because it accentuates the difference in behavior
predicted for ternary-complex and substituted-enzyme mech-
anisms, and is usually straightforward to interpret.
As a
substrate normally binds more tightly to the right enzyme
species than to the wrong one, substrate inhibition is rarely
severe enough to interfere with the analysis described in Sec-
tion 8.4. Substrate inhibition by one substrate at low concen-
trations of the other provides strong positive evidence that
the substituted-enzyme mechanism applies. In contrast, the
observation of a Vapp/Kapp
m
value independent of the concen-
tration of the other substrate (equation 8.16) is only negative
evidence for a substituted-enzyme mechanism because it can
also be explained as a special case of a ternary-complex mech-
anism in which the expected variation in Vapp/Kapp
m
has not
been detected.
In a compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism, sub-
strate inhibition allows the substrate that binds second to be
identiﬁed without product-inhibition studies.
8.6
Product inhibition
Product-inhibition studies are among the most useful of meth-
ods for elucidating the order of binding of substrates and
release of products, as they are both informative and simple
to understand. Provided that only one product is added to
a reaction mixture, the term in the numerator that refers to
the reverse reaction must be zero (except in one-product re-
actions: see Section 9.5.2). The only effect of adding product,
§9.5.2, pages 238–240
therefore, is to increase the denominator of the rate equation,
and thus to inhibit the forward reaction.
214
8. Reactions of More than One Substrate
The question of whether a particular product acts as a
competitive, uncompetitive or mixed inhibitor does not have
an absolute answer, because it depends on which substrate
concentration is considered to be variable. Once this has been
decided, however, the answer is straightforward: the denom-
inator of the rate equation can be separated into variable and
constant terms according to whether they contain the vari-
able substrate concentration or not; the expression for Vapp
depends on the variable terms, whereas the expression for
Vapp/Kapp
m
depends on the constant terms, as in Section 8.4.
§8.4, pages 204–211
§6.2, pages 134–140
As described in Section 6.2 and summarized in Table 6.1), the
various kinds of inhibition are classiﬁed according to whether
they affect Vapp/Kapp
m
(competitive inhibition), Vapp (uncom-
petitive inhibition) or both (mixed inhibition). So a product
is a competitive inhibitor if its concentration appears only
in constant terms, an uncompetitive inhibitor if it appears
only in variable terms, and a mixed inhibitor if it appears in
both. If the product can combine with only one form of the
enzyme, only linear terms in its concentration are possible,
and so the inhibition is linear, but more complex inhibition
becomes possible if the product can also bind to “wrong”
enzyme forms to give dead-end complexes.
These principles can be illustrated with reference to the
compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism under condi-
tions where P is added to the reaction mixture but Q is not,
and A is the variable substrate. The complete rate equation
in coefﬁcient form is equation 8.5, shown here with the terms
that contain q canceled, as these must be zero if q = 0:
v =
e0(N1ab −✘✘✘✘
N−1pq)

D4q + D5ab + D6ap
+✟✟✟
D7bq +✟✟✟
D8pq + D9abp +✘✘✘✘
D10bpq
If these zero terms are omitted, the remaining denominator
terms are classiﬁed as variable if they contain a, the variable
substrate concentration, and constant if they do not:
v =
N1ab
D0 + D1a + D2b + D3p + D5ab + D6ap + D9abp
constant (no a)
variable (contain a) 
(8.18)
As both the constant and variable parts of this expression
contain p it follows that P acts as a mixed inhibitor when A
is the variable substrate.
8.6 Product inhibition
215
If B is the variable substrate we need to revise the classi-
ﬁcation of terms as variable or constant according to whether
they contain b or not,
v =
N1ab
D0 + D1a + D2b + D3p + D5ab + D6ap + D9abp
constant (no b)
variable (contain b) 
but otherwise the analysis is similar, and leads to the same
conclusion, that P is a mixed inhibitor with respect to B.
For inhibition by Q we proceed in the same way, but now
omitting terms that contain p from the rate equation (because
now we are assuming that p = 0), and classiﬁcation for A as
variable substrate is now
constant
variable
v =
N1ab
D0 + D1a + D2b + D4q + D5ab + D7bq
The results are different from those for the other combinations
we have considered, because the denominator of equation 8.5
contains no terms in which a and q are multiplied together,
though q does occur in terms that do not contain a. It follows
that Q is a competitive inhibitor with respect to A. The analy-
sis of the fourth case, inhibition by Q with respect to B, will be
left as an exercise; it leads to the conclusion that this inhibition
is mixed.
In summary, three of the four possible combinations pro-
duce mixed inhibition, and one might be tempted to con-
clusion that product inhibition is thus of limited help for
deciding on the order of binding of substrates and release of
products. However, the three types diverge from one another
in a diagnostically useful way when we consider the trends
when the concentrations of the constant substrate increase. In
the limit of saturation by B, for example, we can ignore terms
in equation 8.18 that do not contain b:
v =
N1ab
D0 + D1a + D2b + D3p + D5ab + D6ap + D9abp

All terms in p in the constant part of the denominator have
disappeared, so the constant becomes independent of p,
whereas the variable part still depends on p. What this means
is the inhibition by P with respect to A approaches uncom-
petitive as B approaches saturation. Similar analysis for the
other two cases of mixed shows that they change differently
with saturation by the constant substrate: inhibition by P with
respect to B remains mixed, but inhibition by Q with respect
to B vanishes, so saturation with A can eliminate inhibition
by Q.
These results are summarized in Table 8.2, and the cor-

substrate, one must search for a King–Altman pattern that
gives rise to a term containing the product concentration but
not the variable substrate concentration; if one is successful
the product concentration must appear in the constant part of
the denominator and there must be a competitive component
in the inhibition. One must then search for a King–Altman
pattern that gives rise to a term containing both the product
concentration and the variable substrate concentration; if one
is successful the product concentration must appear in the
variable part of the denominator and there must be an un-
competitive component in the inhibition. With this informa-
tion it is a simple matter to decide on the type of inhibition.
In searching for suitable King–Altman patterns, one should
remember that product-release steps are irreversible if the
product in question is not present in the reaction mixture.
In two-product reactions, uncompetitive inhibition is largely
conﬁned to the case mentioned, inhibition by the ﬁrst prod-
uct in a competitive ternary-complex mechanism when the
second substrate is saturating. It becomes more common in
reactions with three or more products, and occurs with at least
one product in all compulsory-order mechanisms for such
reactions (Section 8.8).
Rather than including an explicit discussion of inhibition
by substrate analogs, I have preferred to leave consideration
of this as the exercises in Problems 8.7–8 at the end of this
chapter. For a real example, see Monasterio and Cárdenas.
§8.8, pages 218–223
8.7
Design of experiments
The design of an experiment to study an uninhibited two-
substrate reaction rests on principles similar to those for
studying linear inhibition (Section 6.8).
The values of the
Michaelis and inhibition constants for the various substrates
will not of course be known in advance, and some trial
experiments must be done in ignorance.
However, a few
experiments in which one substrate concentration is varied
at each of two concentrations of the other, one as high and the
other as low as practically convenient, should reveal the likely
range of apparent Km values for the ﬁrst substrate. This range
can then be used to select the concentrations of this substrate
218
8. Reactions of More than One Substrate
to be used in a more thorough study. The concentrations of
the other substrate can be selected similarly on the basis of a
converse trial experiment. At each concentration of constant
substrate the variable substrate concentrations should extend
from about 0.2Kapp
m
to about 10Kapp
m
or as high as conveniently
possible, as in the imaginary inhibition experiment outlined
in Table 6.4 (Section 6.8).
It is not necessary to have ex-
actly the same set of varied concentrations of one substrate
at each constant concentration of the other. It is, however,
useful to have sets based loosely on a grid (as in Table 6.4),
because this allows the same experiment to be plotted both
ways, with each substrate designated “variable” in turn. Note
that the labels “variable” and “constant” are experimentally
arbitrary, and are convenient only for analyzing the results,
and especially for deﬁning what we mean by “competitive”,
“uncompetitive”, and so on, in reactions with more than one
substrate.
The design of product-inhibition experiments for multiple-
substrate experiments requires no special discussion beyond
that given in Section 6.8 for linear inhibition studies. It should
§6.8, pages 157–159
be sufﬁcient to emphasize that the experiment should be done
in such a way as to reveal whether signiﬁcant competitive and
uncompetitive components are present.
8.8
Reactions with three or more substrates
The methods for studying reactions with three or more sub-
strates are a logical extension of those described earlier in this
chapter; they do not therefore need as much detailed discus-
sion as two-substrate reactions.
Nonetheless, they are not
uncommon or unimportant in biochemistry, and they include,
for example, the important group of reactions catalyzed by
the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. In this section I shall out-
line some of the main points, with particular attention to
characteristics that are not well exempliﬁed by two-substrate
kinetics.
Three-substrate reactions do not necessarily have three
products,16 but to keep the discussion within manageable
limits I shall consider only a reaction with three substrates,
A, B and C, and three products, P, Q and R. If the mechanism
is branched (so that some steps can occur in random order),
16Reactions with three substrates and two products are common, and
include such well known enzymes as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydro-
genase.
8.8 Reactions with three or more substrates
219
the complete rate equation contains terms in the squares and
possibly higher powers in the reactant concentrations, but if
no such higher-order dependence is observed the most gen-
eral equation for the initial rate in the absence of products is
as follows:
v =
Vabc
KABC + KBCa + KACb + KABc
+KmCab + KmBac + KmAbc + abc
(8.19)
in which V is the limiting rate approached when all three sub-
strate concentrations are extrapolated to saturation; KmA, KmB
and KC are the Michaelis constants for the three substrates
when the other two substrate concentrations are extrapolated
to saturation; and KABC, KBC, KAC and KAB are products of
Michaelis and other constants with speciﬁc meanings that de-
pend on the particular mechanism considered, but which are
analogous to the product KiAKmB that occurs in equation 8.9.

Equation 8.19 applies in full if the reaction proceeds through
a quaternary complex EABC that exists in the steady state in
equilibrium with the free enzyme E and all possible binary
and ternary complexes, EA, EB, EC, EAB, EAC and EBC. In
addition to this fully random-order rapid-equilibrium mech-
anism, a range of other quaternary-complex mechanisms are
possible, in which the order of binding is fully or partly
compulsory. The extreme case is the fully compulsory-order
mechanism shown in Figure 8.34, in which there is only one
binary complex, say EA, and only one ternary complex, say
EAB, possible between E and EABC.
8.8.2
Substituted-enzyme mechanisms
The classiﬁcation of two-substrate mechanisms into ternary-
complex and substituted-enzyme mechanisms also has its
parallel for three-substrate mechanisms, but again the range
of possibilities is considerably greater. The extreme type of
substituted-enzyme mechanism is one in which only binary
complexes occur and each substrate-binding step is followed
by a product-release step, as shown in Figure 8.35. There are
no ternary or quaternary complexes, but two different forms
of substituted enzyme, E′ and E”.

Hybrid mechanisms
These are by no means the only possibilities, however, and
a three-substrate three-product reaction may combine aspects
of both of these kinds of mechanism, so that two substrate
molecules may bind to form a ternary complex, with release
of the ﬁrst product before the third substrate binds, as shown
in Figure 8.36. For example, in most aminoacyl-tRNA syn-
thetases the amino acid and ATP react in the active site of
the enzyme to release pyrophosphate and form a complex
composed of enzyme and aminoacyl-AMP; this then reacts
with the appropriate tRNA to complete the reaction, releasing
aminoacyl-tRNA and AMP from the enzyme. With threonyl-
tRNA synthetase, for example, initial isolation by Allende
and co-workers of the enzyme–threonylAMP complex was
followed by kinetic analysis to conﬁrm the initial interpre-
tation. Many similar studies have since been done with the
other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
In total there are four possible compulsory-order mech-
anisms for a three-substrate three-product reaction, as illus-
trated in Figure 8.37, together with two possible mechanisms
for a three-substrate two-product reaction. On a superﬁcial

examination there may appear to be more possibilities than
those illustrated, but consider the example shown in paren-
theses, with sequence APBCQ: if we rename the reactants
as indicated in Figure 8.38 then this becomes identical to
the mechanism shown next to it, with the difference that a
different enzyme form is considered to be the free enzyme.
In a quaternary-complex mechanism this is not a matter of
opinion, and the free enzyme is the state with no substrates
and no products bound. However, in a substituted-enzyme
mechanism there is always more than one state that could
reasonably be called the free enzyme. In a transaminase, for
example, the pyridoxal-phosphate form of the enzyme is usu-
ally regarded as the free enzyme, but there is nothing abso-
lute about it, and one could also consider the pyridoxamine-
phosphate form as the free enzyme.

Classiﬁcation of three-substrate mechanisms
The number of conceivable mechanisms is very large, and
even if chemically implausible ones are excluded (something
that is not always done) there are still about 18 reasonable
three-substrate three-product mechanisms (listed, for exam-
ple, by Wong and Hanes), without considering such complex-

enzymic mechanisms involving

Biochemistry and Biophysics 135,

ities as nonproductive complexes and isomerizations.
It is
thus especially important to take account of chemical plau-
sibility in studying the kinetics of three-substrate reactions.
Moreover, provided the rate appears to obey the Michaelis–
Menten equation for each substrate considered separately, it
is usual practice to use rate equations derived on the assump-
tion that random-order portions of the mechanism are at equi-
librium, whereas compulsory-order portions are in a steady
state. This, of course, prevents the appearance of higher-order
terms in the rate equation, and provides much scope for the
use of Cha’s method (Section 5.6).
Kinetically, the various mechanisms differ in that they
generate equations similar to equation 8.19 with some of the
denominator terms missing, as ﬁrst noted by Frieden. For

example, with the mechanism illustrated in Figure 8.36 it
is evident from inspection that the constant and the terms
in a and b are missing from the denominator of the rate
equation (because one cannot ﬁnd any King–Altman patterns
that contain no concentrations, or a only, or b only: compare
Section 5.7). Thus instead of equation 8.19 the rate equation
for this mechanism is as follows:
v =
Vabc
KABc + KmCab + KmBac + KmAbc + abc

of the other two this equation is of the form of the Michaelis–
Menten equation, with apparent constants as listed in Table

is also instructive to examine the expressions for Vapp and
compare them with equations 8.9 and 8.13. With a variable,

variable, Vapp/Kapp

increases with a but is independent of c;
with c variable, Vapp/Kapp
m
is constant, independent of both a
and b. This immediately distinguishes A and B from C, but
not from each other.
A and B can be distinguished, however, by considering the
effect of adding a single product. Although the rate equation
contains no term in a alone, it does contain a term in ap if P
is added to the reaction mixture, as illustrated in Figure 8.39.
Terms in aq or ar cannot, however, be generated by addition
of Q or R, and none of the three products alone can generate
a term in bp, bq or br. Treating p as a constant, we can, in

the terminology of Wong and Hanes, say that addition of P
recalls the missing term in a to the rate equation. On the other
hand, Q and R cannot recall the term in a and none of the three
products can recall the term in b. The practical consequence
of this is that if P is present in the reaction mixture, Vapp/Kapp
m
for variable b becomes dependent on c, but Vapp/Kapp
m
for
variable a remains independent of c regardless of which prod-
uct is present.
Product inhibition in three-substrate three-product reac-
tions obeys principles similar to those outlined in Section 8.6,
§8.6, pages 213–217
with the additional feature that uncompetitive inhibition be-
comes a relatively common phenomenon:
it occurs with
at least one substrate–product pair in all compulsory-order
mechanisms. For the mechanism we have been discussing,
for example, Q must be uncompetitive with respect to both
A and B, because, in the absence of both P and R, all King–
Altman patterns giving a dependence on q also include ab.
Similarly, R must be uncompetitive with respect to C.
This brief discussion of some salient points of mechanisms
for three-substrate reactions, with emphasis on a single exam-
ple, cannot be more than an introduction to a large subject.
Wong and Hanes give more information. Dixon and Webb

about possibly misleading results should be noted.

The principles of analysis of three-substrate reactions can
be generalized to greater numbers of substrates, and Elliott
and Tipton have described how to do this for four-substrate
reactions.

exist: for example, Noriega and co-workers have studied
the kinetics of porphobilinogen deaminase. In fact enzymes
can have many more than four substrates, especially those
that catalyze the synthesis of cyclic peptides: cyclosporin
synthetase, the extreme example, having as many as 29, with
a mechanism of at least 40 steps, as described by Lawens and
Zocher. However, it is hardly practical to apply the ordinary
methods of steady-state kinetics to such enzymes.
Summary of Chapter 8
• The majority of enzyme-catalyzed reactions have two sub-
§8.2, pages 190–198
strates and two products, and can be regarded as group-
transfer reactions (though the name is often reserved for
those that are neither hydrolases nor oxidoreductases).
• Mechanisms for group-transfer reactions in which both sub-
§§8.2.1–8.2.2, pages 190–195
strates bind to the enzyme before any product is released
are ternary-complex mechanisms, whereas mechanisms in
which the ﬁrst product is released before binding of the second
substrate are substituted-enzyme mechanisms.
• The rate equations for reactions of more than one substrate
§§8.3–8.4, pages 198–211
are the same as those for one-substrate reactions when only
one substrate concentration is varied.
• Primary plots made when only one substrate concentra-
§§8.4.3–8.4.5, pages 208–211
tion is varied yield apparent values of Michaelis–Menten
parameters, and secondary plots made with these apparent
values as functions of the constant concentration of the other
substrate allow true parameters to be determined.
• When substrate inhibition exists, it yields measurements
§8.5, pages 211–213
that are more sensitive for distinguishing between mecha-
nisms than ones made under conditions where substrate in-
hibition is not visible.
• Product inhibition is the tool of choice for indicating the

8.1
The progressive hydrolysis of the α(1 →4) glucosidic
bonds of amylose is catalyzed both by α-amylase and
by β-amylase.
With α-amylase the newly formed re-
ducing group has the same α-conﬁguration (before mu-
tarotation) as the corresponding linkage in the polymer,
whereas with β-amylase it has the β-conﬁguration. Sug-
gest reasonable mechanisms for the two group-transfer
reactions that would account for these observations.

Petersen and Degn reported that when laccase from Rhus
vernicifera catalyzes the oxidation of hydroquinone by
molecular oxygen, the rate increases indeﬁnitely as the
concentrations of both substrates are increased in con-
stant ratio, with no evidence of saturation. They account
for these observations in terms of a substituted-enzyme
mechanism in which the initial oxidation of enzyme by
oxygen occurs in a single step, followed by a second
step in which the enzyme is regenerated as a result of
reduction of the oxidized enzyme by hydroquinone. Ex-
plain why this mechanism accounts for the inability of
the substrates to saturate the enzyme.

Isotope exchange and isotope effects
It is little exaggeration to say that the availability of isotopes
ranks with that of the spectrophotometer in importance for
the development of classical biochemistry.
Hardly any of
the metabolic pathways currently known could have been
elucidated without the use of isotopes. In enzyme kinetics
the balance of importance is much more strongly in favor
of spectrophotometry than it is in biochemistry as a whole,
but there are still some major uses of isotopes that need to
be considered.
Before discussing these, it is important to
emphasize that the two major classes of application are not
merely different from one another, but diametrically opposite
from one another.
Isotope exchange, and other uses of isotopes as labels, de-
pend on the assumption that isotopic substitution of an atom
has no effect on its chemical properties and that any effects on
its kinetic properties are small enough to be neglected in the
analysis: the isotopic label is used just as a way of identifying
molecules that would otherwise be lost in a sea of identical
ones. Analysis of isotope effects, on the other hand, assumes
that there are measurable differences in kinetic or equilibrium
properties of isotopically substituted molecules. The two sets
of assumptions cannot, of course, be true simultaneously, but

9. Use of Isotopes for Studying Enzyme Mechanisms
in practice this presents little problem, as one can normally set
up conditions where the appropriate assumptions are valid.
In fact, the experimental differences between the two sorts
of application are considerable, as listed in Table 9.1.
Na-
ture has been generous in providing two heavy isotopes of
hydrogen, the most important element for studying isotope
effects because these depend on relative differences in atomic
mass (Section 9.6), which are at their greatest for the lightest
elements. Radioactive isotopes of three of the most important
biological elements are also available, but there are none for
nitrogen or oxygen: although this has serious consequences
for the study of metabolism, it is less important for isotope
exchange as a kinetic probe of enzyme mechanisms, because
with nearly all molecules it is possible to label a suitable
carbon or hydrogen atom remote from the site of reaction.

Principles of isotope exchange
Study of the initial rates of multiple-substrate reactions in
both forward and reverse directions, and in the presence and
absence of products, will usually eliminate many possible re-
action pathways and give a good idea of the gross features of
the mechanism, but it will not usually reveal the existence of
any minor alternative pathways if these contribute negligibly
to the total rate.
Further information is therefore required
to provide a deﬁnitive picture. Even if a clear mechanism
does emerge from measurements of initial rates and product
inhibition, it is valuable to be able to conﬁrm its validity inde-
pendently. The important technique of isotope exchange can
often satisfy these requirements. It was introduced to enzyme
kinetics by Boyer, though McKay noted the fundamental

limitations of measurements of
rates of isotope exchange and
incorporation in catalyzed
reactions” Archives of Bio-
chemistry and Biophysics 82,

point earlier: even if a chemical reaction is at equilibrium,
H. A. C. McKay (1938) “Kinetics
of exchange reactions” Nature
142, 997–998
when its net rate is zero by deﬁnition, the unidirectional rates
through steps or groups of steps can be measured by means
of isotopic tracers. Use of nonisotopic tracers is older still,
dating back to Knoop’s investigation of fatty acid oxidation,
F. Knoop (1904) Der Abbau
aromatischer Fettsäuren im
Tierkörper, Kuttruff, Freiburg
but although chemical tracers such as the phenyl group could
yield important qualitative information, kinetic use of tracers
had to wait until isotopes became available.
Two important assumptions are normally needed for ki-
netic analysis of isotope exchange experiments.
They are
usually true and are often merely implied, but it is as well
to state them clearly to avoid misunderstanding. The ﬁrst
is that a reaction that involves radioactive substrates follows

1 Nonkinetic uses of isotopes do not necessarily agree with the generalizations given.
For example, heavy isotopes of oxygen (17O and 18O) have been used with success to
study the stereochemistry of substitution reactions at phosphorus atoms, but as these
isotopes are not radioactive they have to be measured by other techniques, such as mass
spectrometry, as described by Abbott and co-workers, or nuclear magnetic resonance,
described by Jarvest and co-workers, which are not sensitive enough to be used with
only trace amounts of isotopic label.

require saturation of the enzyme with substituted molecules are not possible with 3H.
the same mechanism as the normal reaction, with the same
rate constants. In other words, isotope effects (Section 9.6) are
assumed to be negligible. This assumption is usually true,
provided that 3H (tritium) is not used as a radioactive label.
Even then, isotope effects are likely to be negligible if the 3H

atom is not directly involved in the reaction or in binding
the substrate to the enzyme. The second assumption is that
the concentrations of all radioactive species are so low that
they have no perceptible effect on the concentrations of the
unlabeled species. This assumption can usually be made to
be true, and it is important, because it allows labeled species
to be ignored in calculating the concentrations of unlabeled
species, and release of label to be treated as irreversible. Both
of these considerations simplify the analysis considerably.
Isotope exchange is most easily understood in relation
to an example, such as the one shown in Figure 9.1, which
represents the transfer of a radioactive atom (represented by
an asterisk) from A* to P* in the compulsory-order ternary-
complex mechanism. As this exchange requires A* to bind
to E, it can occur only if there is a signiﬁcant concentration
of E. The exchange reaction must therefore be inhibited by
high concentrations of either A or Q, as they compete with
A* for E. The effects of B and P are more subtle: on the one
230
9. Use of Isotopes for Studying Enzyme Mechanisms
hand, the exchange reaction includes the binding of B to EA*,
and so a ﬁnite concentration of B is required. On the other
hand, if B and P are present at very high concentrations, the
enzyme will exist largely as ternary complex EX, and so there
will be no E for A* to bind to. One would therefore expect
high concentrations of B and P to inhibit the exchange, and
it is not difﬁcult to show that this expectation is correct. The
rates of change of intermediate concentrations can be written
in the usual way and set to zero according to the steady-state
assumption:
d[EA∗]
dt
= k1a∗[E] −(k−1 + k2b)[EA∗] + k−2[EA∗B] = 0
d[EA∗B]
dt
= k2b[EA∗] −(k−2 + k3)[EA∗B] + k−3p∗[EQ] = 0
These are a pair of simultaneous equations with [EA*] and
[EA*B] as unknowns. The solution for [EA*B], with p∗set to
zero, is as follows:
[EA∗B] =
k1k2a∗b[E]
k−1(k−2 + k3) + k2k3b
The initial rate of exchange v∗is given by k3[EA∗B], or
v∗=
k1k2k3a∗b[E]
k−1(k−2 + k3) + k2k3b
(9.1)
This equation is independent of any assumptions about the
effect of the radioactively labeled reactants on the unlabeled
reaction, but before it can be used we need an expression for
[E] to insert into it.

from B* to P* for the same
mechanism as the one shown in
Figure 9.1. The only unlabeled
enzyme forms involved in this
transfer are EA and EQ.
As indicated above, the treatment is greatly simpliﬁed by
assuming that the concentrations of the unlabeled reactants
are unaffected by the presence of trace amounts of labeled
species; accordingly the value of [E] is the same as if there
were no label. If the experiment is done with the unlabeled
reaction in the steady state the expression for [E] derived
in Section 5.3 must be used, but this leads to complicated

expressions and is fortunately unnecessary.
There are two
ways of avoiding the complications: either one can study
isotope exchange with the unlabeled reaction at equilibrium,
as discussed in Section 9.3, or one can consider not the actual
rates of exchange but ratios of such rates, discussed in Sec-
tion 9.5.1. The equilibrium method is by far the better known
and more widely used of the two, but both are powerful and
useful methods.
9.3 Isotope exchange at equilibrium
231
Transfer of label from B* to P* in the same system (Figure
9.2) involves only EA and EQ, not E or EX because these are
not part of the mechanism of transfer.
The steady state is
deﬁned by setting the rate of change of [EX*] to zero:
d[EX∗]
dt
= k2b∗[EA] −(k−2 + k3)[EX∗] + k−3p∗[EQ] = 0
When p∗= 0 the term in [EQ] vanishes, and the expression
for [EX∗] can be written down immediately:
[EX∗] = k2b∗[EA]
k−2 + k3
and the rate of transfer is simply k3[EX∗]:
v∗= k2k3b∗[EA]
k−2 + k3
(9.2)
9.3
Isotope exchange at equilibrium
If the unlabeled reaction is at equilibrium the concentration of
free enzyme in the compulsory-order ternary-complex mech-
anism is as follows:
[E] =
e0
1 + k1a
k−1
+ k1k2ab
k−1k−2
+ k1k2k3abp
k−1k−2k−3
(9.3)
The four terms in the denominator refer to the four enzyme
species E, EA, EX and EQ, and each is in the appropriate
equilibrium ratio to the preceding one, for example, [EA]/[E]
= k1a/k−1, and so on.
The equation does not contain q,
because, if equilibrium is to be maintained, only three of the
four reactant concentrations can be chosen at will. Any one of
a, b and p can be replaced with q by means of the following
identity:
Keq =
k1k2k3k4
k−1k−2k−3k−4
= pq
ab
(9.4)
For example, if we wanted to examine the effect of increasing
b and p in constant ratio at some constant values of a and q, it
would be appropriate to replace p by q using equation 9.4, and
if this is done substitution of equation 9.3 into equation 9.1
232

gives the rate of isotope exchange at chemical equilibrium:
v∗=

1 + k1a
k−1
+ k1k2ab
k−1k−2
+ k−4q
k4

[k−1(k−2 + k3) + k2k3b]
(9.5)
As the numerator of this equation is proportional to b whereas
the denominator is a quadratic in b it is evident that it has
the same form as the equation for linear substrate inhibition,
equation 6.25. Thus as b and p are increased from zero to
saturation the rate of exchange increases to a maximum and
then decreases back to zero.
The equations for any other exchange reaction can be
derived similarly, for example for exchange from B to P in
the same mechanism, in which case we need to substitute an
expression for the concentration of EA into equation 9.2. As
[EA]/[E] = k1a/k−1, and [E] is given by equation 9.3, we can
immediately write down the result:
v∗=
k1k2k3e0ab∗

1 + k1a
k−1
+ k1k2ab
k−1k−2
+ k−4q

k−1(k−2 + k3)
(9.6)
At ﬁrst sight this equation may not seem much simpler than
equation 9.5, but it differs in an important respect: the right-
hand part of the denominator is a constant, independent of
any concentrations. The equation as a whole, therefore, has a
Michaelis–Menten dependence on a. It follows that exchange
between B* and P* or Q* is not inhibited by A, because satu-
rating concentrations of A do not remove EA from the system
but instead bring its concentration to a maximum. Similar
results apply to the reverse reaction (as they logically must for
a system at equilibrium, as in such a system the forward rate
of any step is the same as the reverse rate): exchange from
Q* is inhibited by excess of P, but exchange from P* is not
inhibited by excess of Q.
The random-order ternary-complex mechanism differs
from the compulsory-order mechanism in that no exchange
can be completely inhibited by the substrate that is not in-
volved in the exchange. For example, if B is present in ex-
cess, the particular pathway for A* to P* exchange considered
above is inhibited because E is removed from the system, but
the exchange is not inhibited completely because an alterna-
tive pathway is available: at high concentrations of B, A* can
enter into exchange reactions by binding to EB to produce

is possible to detect minor pathways by isotope exchange.

Isotope exchange in substituted-enzyme

of a reaction following the substituted-enzyme mechanism,
thereby allowing a useful simpliﬁcation of the mechanism to

mechanism, with P* and A* replacing B and Q respectively,
but the kinetics are simpler because the rate constants are
the same for the two halves of the reaction. This type of ex-
change represents a major qualitative difference between the
substituted-enzyme mechanism and ternary-complex mecha-
nisms, because in ternary-complex mechanisms no exchange
can occur unless the system is complete.
This method of
distinguishing between the two types of mechanism was, in
fact, used and discussed by Doudoroff and co-workers, and
by Koshland, well before the introduction of isotope exchange

as a kinetic technique.
The possibility of studying only parts of mechanisms
in this way is especially valuable with more complicated
substituted-enzyme mechanisms with three or more sub-
strates.
In such cases, any simpliﬁcation of the kinetics is
obviously to be welcomed, and this approach has been used
with some success, for example, by Cedar and Schwartz in the

study of asparagine synthetase.
This capacity of many enzymes to catalyze partial reac-
tions implies that isotope-exchange experiments require more
highly puriﬁed enzyme than conventional experiments if the
results are to be valid.
The reason for this requirement is
simple.
Suppose one is studying aspartate transaminase,
which catalyzes the following reaction (shown in more detail
in equation 8.4):
glutamate + oxaloacetate ⇋2-oxoglutarate + aspartate
Small quantities of contaminating enzymes, for example,
other transaminases, are of little importance if one is fol-
lowing the complete reaction, because it is unlikely that any
of the contaminants is a catalyst for the complete reaction.
Exchange between glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate is another
matter, however, especially if one is using a highly sensitive
234
9. Use of Isotopes for Studying Enzyme Mechanisms
assay, and one must be certain that contaminating transam-
inases are not present if one wants to get valid information
about aspartate transaminase. Although this warning applies
especially to enzymes that operate by substituted-enzyme
mechanisms, no harm can coming of paying extra attention
to enzyme purity with other enzymes also, even though these
are not expected to catalyze partial reactions; as discussed at
the end of Section 8.2.3, there may be many enzymes that react

those that are generally acknowledged to do so.

Nonequilibrium isotope exchange

Chemiﬂux ratios
As noted above, the rate equations for isotope exchange be-
come excessively complicated if the unlabeled reaction is not
maintained at equilibrium during the exchange. Nonetheless,
there is good reason to study enzyme reactions that are not
at equilibrium, because at chemical equilibrium it is impos-
sible to disentangle effects of substrate binding from effects
of product release, and unless the enzyme is capable of cat-
alyzing a half-reaction (Section 9.4) one is forced to consider a

by contrast, allows the part of a mechanism responsible for a
particular exchange to be isolated for separate examination.

The crucial step in making nonequilibrium isotope ex-
change a usable technique without becoming enmired in
hopeless complications was made by Britton.
He realized
that measuring and comparing simultaneous exchanges from
one reactant to two others allows one to greatly simplify the
rate expressions by dividing one by the other.
This is be-
cause mechanistic features outside the part of the mechanism
responsible for the two exchanges affect both rates in the
same way and therefore do not affect their ratio. Britton’s
approach has similarities with Waley’s method of deriving
rate equations described in Section 5.8, as both depend on ir-
reversibility of the process analyzed, but the correspondence
is not exact because in nonequilibrium isotope exchange the
unlabeled reaction may not be irreversible.

This idea can be illustrated by reference to a mechanistic
fragment capable of converting two substrates into a product
P, as illustrated in Figure 9.4. This can represent a complete
reaction (with E′ identical to E), or it can be a fragment of
a larger scheme, of which the rest can be arbitrarily compli-
cated without affecting the analysis, provided that it does not

include any alternative way of interconverting A + B with P.
Let us suppose now that we have P∗† doubly labeled in such a
way that we can measure simultaneous conversion to A∗and
to B†.1 As we do not need to mention the labels explicitly
for deriving the equations they will be omitted: it is sufﬁ-
cient to remember that when we refer to the unidirectional
conversion of (say) P into A the existence of a suitable label
is implicit.
In this context it is conventional to refer to a
unidirectional rate of this kind as a ﬂux but unfortunately this
distinction between rates and ﬂuxes is quite different from
(almost opposite to) the way in which the same pair of words
is used in metabolic control analysis (Section 13.4). For this
§13.4, pages 341–344
reason I shall use the longer term chemiﬂux recommended by
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry for a
International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (1981)

chemical kinetics” Pure and
Applied Chemistry 53, 753–771
unidirectional rate, with the symbol F(X →Y) to represent
the chemiﬂux from X to Y.
The chemiﬂux from P to E′P is clearly v3 = k3[E′]p. How-
ever, this is not the chemiﬂux from P to B, and still less is it that
from P to A, because not all of the molecules of E′P produced
by binding P to E′ continue in the same direction of reaction
and release B; some of them return to regenerate E′ and P. Fur-
thermore, some of the EA molecules produced by the release
of B from E′P also return to E′ and P (with the uptake of a
different molecule of B) instead of releasing A. It is obvious
immediately that if the mechanism is as shown in Figure 9.4
the chemiﬂux from P to B is greater than the chemiﬂux from P
to A, but we can put this on a quantitative basis by consider-
ing the probabilities at each point of continuing in the same
direction or reversing. For a molecule of E′P produced by
binding of P to E′ this probability is v−2/(v−2 + v3), because
there are only two possible outcomes, either continuation to
EA + B or return to E′ + P, which have rates v−2 and v3
respectively. So the chemiﬂux from P to B is
F(P →B) =
F(P →EP)F(EP →B)
F(P →EP) + F(EP →B)
= v−2v−3
v−2 + v3
= k−2k−3[E]p

(9.7)
To calculate the chemiﬂux from P to A, we ﬁrst note that
F(P →EA) is the same as F(P →B), just given in equa-
1It should perhaps be said explicitly that it is not necessary (and might
well be impossible to achieve) for any individual molecules to be doubly
labeled: it is quite sufﬁcient for singly labeled stock solutions to be mixed
together.

tion 9.7, because EA and B are released in the same step, and
hence necessarily at the same rate. We also need the reverse
chemiﬂux F(EA →P), which may be calculated similarly: it
is the rate v2 from EA to E′P multiplied by the probability
v3/(v−2 + v3) that E′P, once formed, will continue to E′ + P:
F(EA →P) =
v2v3
v−2 + v3
= k2k3[EA]b
k−2 + k3
The chemiﬂux from P to A is then the chemiﬂux from P to EA
(equation 9.7) multiplied by the probability that the molecule
of EA, once formed, will release A rather than returning to P:
F(P →A) =
F(P →EA)F(EA →A)

(9.8)
At this point one is tempted to despair: if the expression
for a chemiﬂux in a simple three-step mechanistic fragment is
as complicated as this, before even the concentration of E has
been substituted to produce a usable equation, what hope is
there of obtaining manageable equations for mechanisms of
real interest? However, although such equations are indeed
hopelessly complicated if each one is examined in isolation,
they simplify dramatically when one is divided by another to
obtain the expression for a chemiﬂux ratio.
This will become clear in a moment, but ﬁrst we must
dispose of a second question that is likely to arise in relation
to expressions like equation 9.8: would it not be tidier to mul-
tiply the numerator and denominator by k−2 + k3 and then
multiply out all the brackets? This is a temptation that has to
be resisted: the potential simpliﬁcation by this process is actu-
ally so slight as to be negligible, and if chemiﬂux expressions
are left in their untidy forms it is easy (with practice) to recog-
nize by inspection the reason for every term in the equation,
whereas this logic is obscured by multiplying out. Moreover,
equations in their untidy forms are convenient for comparing
with one another.
Thus, it is evident from inspection that
equation 9.8 differs from equation 9.7 only by the factor k−1
in the numerator and the second term in parentheses in the
9.5 Nonequilibrium isotope exchange

denominator. The chemiﬂux ratio is therefore as follows:
F(P →B)
F(P →A) = 1 +

tration of the substrate that binds ﬁrst in the forward reaction,
does not appear in it, and that it expresses a simple straight-
line dependence on b, the concentration of the substrate that
binds second.
The conclusions embodied in equation 9.9 depend on re-
markably few assumptions. The reaction may be proceeding
from A + B to P, or from P to A + B, or it may be at equilibrium.
The concentrations a, b and p may have any values, either
in absolute units or relative to one another.
The recycling
of E′ to E may be extremely simple (they can even be the
same species), or it can be arbitrarily complicated (as long as it
does not contain an alternative way of converting A + B into
P). This means also, of course, that there is no assumption
that the reaction as a whole obeys Michaelis–Menten kinetics
or any other simple kinetic equation. If other reactants are
involved they may participate in any order and may be in-
termingled with the steps shown in Figure 9.4; for example,
instead of the one-step reaction shown the binding of B to EA
may be a three-step process in which another substrate C also
binds and another product Q is released. Dead-end reactions,
whether inside or outside the fragment that converts A + B to
P, have no effect on the form of the chemiﬂux ratio. It follows,
therefore, that measurement of chemiﬂux ratios provides a
remarkably powerful method of studying speciﬁc questions
of binding order in isolation from other mechanistic features.
It is obvious from symmetry considerations that equa-
tion 9.9 cannot apply when A and B can bind to the en-
zyme in random order, as it would not then be possible for

the chemiﬂux ratio to depend on one substrate but not the
other.
Analysis of the full random-order ternary-complex
mechanism shows this to be correct, and that when A and
B bind in random order the chemiﬂux ratio from P shows a
hyperbolic dependence on both substrate concentrations: an
example of such behavior may be found in experiments of
Merry and Britton on rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase. I
have discussed the theory of these experiments in more detail

9.5.2
Isomerase kinetics
One might guess that the simplest kinds of kinetic experi-
ments would be sufﬁcient with isomerases (including mu-
tases, racemases and epimerases), as these are enzymes that
catalyze genuine one-substrate one-product reactions. How-
ever, isomerases present a special difﬁculty that is obvious
when it is pointed out but easy to overlook: it is impossible
to do conventional product inhibition experiments with a
reaction with only one product, because a reaction cannot
be irreversible if the mixture contains both substrate and
product simultaneously. Consequently, the negative term in
the numerator of the rate expression cannot be neglected,
invalidating the crucial assumption that allows most kinetic
equations to be simpliﬁed to the point where conventional
graphical and statistical methods can be used.
This limitation is especially serious for isomerases because
of a mechanistic feature that is important for them but can
more justiﬁably be neglected for other enzymes.
One can
postulate that there may be a compulsory enzyme isomeriza-
tion step in any mechanism, the form of free enzyme released
at the end of the reaction being different from the form en-
tering into the ﬁrst step, so that an enzyme isomerization is
needed to complete the cycle. However, in a reaction with
multiple substrates and products there is no particular reason
to postulate this: if one examines the substituted-enzyme
mechanism (equation 8.4), for example, there is no reason to
expect the chemical process to be rendered more facile by
introducing such a step. By contrast, for an isomerase the
advantages of an enzyme isomerization step are much clearer.
For example, a mutase, an enzyme that catalyzes movement
of a group from one position to another in the same substrate
molecule (Figure 9.9, below), can easily be imagined as a
protein that exists in two forms, each complementary to one
of the two reactants, but which can rapidly switch between
its two states. Thus an essential part of a mechanistic study

catalysis. I. Isotopic experi-
ments, enzyme interconversion,
and oversaturation” Journal of
Theoretical Biology 124, 137–171
of an isomerase ought to be to determine whether it does
operate in this way.
Albery and Knowles went as far as
9.5 Nonequilibrium isotope exchange
239
to argue that “no kinetic investigation of an enzyme can be
considered complete until experiments have been conducted
to determine whether the rate-limiting steps in the saturated
region are concerned with substrate handling or with free
enzyme interconversion”. This view is certainly justiﬁed in
relation to isomerases, though it may seem exaggerated if
applied to other enzymes.

Conventional kinetics cannot answer this question, how-
ever. If we apply the method of King and Altman to the mech-
anism for a one-substrate one-product reaction with enzyme
isomerization shown in Figure 9.7 this is not immediately
obvious, because the rate equation contains a term in ap that
might appear to be detectable by ordinary techniques:
v =
k1k2k3e0a −k−1k−2k−3e0p
(k−1 + k2)(k−3 + k3) + k1(k2 + k3)a
(9.10)
+ (k−1 + k−3)k−2p + k1k−2ap
However, the “ordinary technique” in question is product
inhibition, which, as noted above, is not possible under irre-
versible conditions with a one-product enzyme. Nonetheless,

the problem still seems to be accessible to analysis by ordinary
techniques if one measures the rate while varying a and p
in constant ratio, putting p = ra for example, where r is a
constant, because then the rate equation takes a simple form
with only one term in the numerator:
v =
(k1k2k3 −k−1k−2k−3r)e0a
(k−1 + k2)(k−3 + k3) + [k1(k2 + k3)
(9.11)
+ (k−1 + k−3)k−2r]a + k1k−2ra2
This equation is of the standard form for substrate inhibition,
equation 6.25, and in principle therefore if enzyme isomer-
ization occurs the rate must show a maximum when studied
as a function of both reactant concentrations varied in con-
stant ratio. However, whether this maximum is observable
within an accessible range of concentrations will depend on
the rate constants. One possibility is obvious: if k3 and k3 are
both very large E and E′ are not kinetically distinguishable,
the mechanism becomes equivalent to the ordinary one-step
Michaelis–Menten mechanism and the term in a2 is unde-
tectable. Britton, however, pointed out a second possibility

of determining rate constants in

duced transport: limitations of

that is much less obvious and, indeed, remains surprising and
unintuitive even after one has checked the algebra: the term in
a2 also becomes undetectable if k−1 and k2 are both very large,
240

which means that it is undetectable if isomerization of the free
enzyme is rate-limiting at high concentrations. He showed
that even if it is detectable, any particular set of observed
parameters will be consistent with two different sets of rate
constants, one giving much greater importance to enzyme
isomerization than the other. In summary, therefore, analysis
of the sort of kinetics expressed by equations 9.10–9.11 cannot
give an unambiguous indication of the importance of enzyme
isomerization. In a recent study of fumarase Mescam and co-
workers conﬁrmed the correctness of Britton’s analysis.

Tracer perturbation is an isotope-exchange technique that
overcomes the sort of interpretational problems discussed in
Section 9.5.2. We have been tacitly assuming that the product
§9.5.2, pages 238–240
in an isomerase reaction results from rearranging the atoms
of the substrate into a different structure. This does not have
to be so, however, and it is not necessarily even likely. In a
mutase (Figure 9.9) E and E′ of Figure 9.7 may be different
phosphoenzymes, so that the enzyme-substrate complex is
a bisphosphate, with the phospho group that appears in the
product derived from the enzyme and not from the substrate
in the same catalytic cycle. The reaction catalyzed by phos-
phoglucomutase, for example, is the transfer of the phospho
group of glucose 6-phosphate to the 1-position, as shown in
Figure 9.9, and the mechanism of Figure 9.7 is shown in a
more graphic way, and applied speciﬁcally to phosphoglu-
comutase, in Figure 9.10, with the two forms of free enzyme
written as E1 and E6 rather than as E and E′.
In an equilibrium mixture between labeled reactants [14C]-
glucose 6-phosphate and [14C]-glucose 6-phosphate, both E1
and E6 exist, in such proportions that the chemiﬂuxes in the
two directions from are equal. If a large excess of unlabeled
glucose 6-phosphate is added to such an equilibrium mixture,
the ensuing reaction from glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-
phosphate will perturb the equilibrium between E1 and E6, in
such a way that in the limit E1 disappears from the reaction
mixture, leaving no enzyme form capable of reacting with
[14C]-glucose 6-phosphate, though E6 remains available to
react with [14C]-glucose 1-phosphate. Thus the only direc-
tion possible for the labeled reaction is from [14C]-glucose 1-
phosphate to [14C]-glucose 6-phosphate. It follows, therefore,
that if enzyme isomerization occurs as in Figure 9.10 (or, more
generally, Figure 9.7) swamping the system with unlabeled
9.5 Nonequilibrium isotope exchange
241
reactant will perturb the labeled reaction away from equi-
librium in the opposite direction from that of the unlabeled
reaction.

ism and estimation of kinetic

This is not, however, the only plausible way in which a
mutase-catalyzed reaction can occur, and Figure 9.12 illus-
trates an alternative in which a ternary complex is formed
and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate is both second substrate and
ﬁrst product. In this mechanism both glucose 6-phosphate
and glucose 1-phosphate bind to the same free enzyme, and
so addition of unlabeled reactants has no effect on an equilib-
rium between the labeled reactants. It might seem simpler to
distinguish between the two mechanisms on the basis of the
fact that the ternary-complex mechanism requires catalytic
amounts of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and the substituted-
enzyme mechanism does not. However, this difference is illu-
sory, because if a phosphoenzyme has a tendency to lose the
phospho group with time the reaction will need to be primed
with glucose 1,6-bisphosphate to produce a reactive form of
enzyme. So an experimental need for catalytic amounts of
glucose 1,6-bisphosphate would not prove that the mecha-
nism of Figure 9.12 was correct.

Figure 9.13. Transfer of 32P
requires two catalytic cycles,
and proceeds in the same
direction as the unlabeled
reaction.
The mechanism of Figure 9.9 also allows an excess of un-
labeled substrate to perturb the equilibrium between labeled
reactants in the same direction as the unlabeled reaction, and
this is what happens if the reactants of phosphoglucomutase
are labeled with 32P rather than with 14C or 3H. Transfer
of a phospho group then requires two catalytic cycles, from
glucose 6-phosphate to E1 in the ﬁrst and from E6 to glucose
1-phosphate in the second, as illustrated in Figure 9.13. As
the second cycle requires participation of unlabeled glucose
6-phosphate, the whole process can only proceed in the same
direction as the unlabeled reaction, albeit very slowly because
of the very small amount of E1 available to react with glucose
6-[32P]-phosphate.
It follows from this analysis that if a tracer-perturbation
experiment is done using 32P as the label there will be a
small perturbation in the direction of the unlabeled reaction,
whereas if the same system is studied using 14C or 3H as label
there will be a larger perturbation in the opposite direction.
Britton and Clarke found that rabbit-muscle phosphogluco-
mutase behaved exactly in accordance with these predictions.

Primary isotope effects
For most purposes one can assume that the different isotopes
of an element have the same thermodynamic and kinetic
properties. Indeed, the whole use of radioactive isotopes as
tracers, on which a large part of the whole ediﬁce of mod-
ern biochemistry is built, depends on just this assumption.
J
EREMY RANDALL KNOWLES
(1938–2008), the son of an
academic economist at
Oxford, was born in Rugby.
He was educated at Oxford as a
chemist, and started his
research in the study of the
mechanisms of aromatic nitra-
tion reactions. Although he
soon decided that enzyme
mechanisms were more inter-
esting, his earlier training
allowed him to see enzyme
mechanisms with the eyes of an
organic chemist, albeit one with
an appreciation of what is
important in biology. He con-
sidered that enzyme catalysis
was “not different, just better”.
After some years as University
Lecturer in Chemistry at
Oxford, he moved to Harvard
in 1974, where he remained
until the end of his life. A
consummate teacher, lecturer
and researcher, he was also a
brilliant administrator, and his
research career unfortunately
came to an end after he was
persuaded to become Dean of
Arts and Sciences at Harvard in
1991.
Nonetheless, it is not precisely correct, and, in reactions where
a slow step involves breaking a bond between hydrogen and a
heavier atom the difference in properties between the isotopes
of hydrogen becomes large enough to cause serious errors if it
is not taken into account. This has both negative and positive
consequences. The negative consequence is that when using
tritium (3H) as a radioactive tracer one must be careful to
ensure that it is remote from the site of any reaction.
In
practice this is usually easy to achieve, because “remote” just
means separated by at least two atoms; however, it should not
be forgotten.
The positive consequence of kinetic isotope effects is that
they can be used to obtain mechanistic information that
would be difﬁcult to obtain in other ways. Because of this
useful aspect, I shall give a brief account of their origin in this
section. It will inevitably be oversimpliﬁed, but more rigorous
accounts are given by Jencks and by Bell.2

The energy of a C—H bond as a function of the dis-
tance separating the two atoms depends only on the electron
clouds surrounding the two atoms and is the same for all
isotopes of carbon and hydrogen.
However, as the bond
vibrates, the particular energies available are quantized, and
the speciﬁc quantum levels available to a bond depend on
the masses of the vibrating atoms, so they are different for
different isotopes. This would have no observable effect if
the temperature were high enough for the bonds in a sample
of matter to have vibrational energies randomly distributed
among several states, but at ordinary temperatures virtually
every C—H bond is in its vibrational ground state. This does
not correspond to the actual minimum on the potential energy
curve, but to the zero-point energy of the bond, which reﬂects

bond than in a C—1H bond, the C—2H bond requires input of about 4.8 kJ
mol−1 more energy to reach the same transition state.
the persistence of vibration even at absolute zero. It turns out
that the ground state for a C—2H bond is typically about 4.8
kJ mol−1 lower (deeper in the potential well) than that of a
C—1H bond.3
To a ﬁrst approximation breaking a C—H bond in the rate-
limiting step of a reaction passes through a transition state of
the molecule in which the bond to be broken is stretched to the
point where it has lost one degree of freedom for vibration but
all other bonds are in their ground states. This implies that the
transition state is the same for C—2H as for C—1H, but as the
ground state is lower for C—2H it requires 4.8 kJ mol−1 more
enthalpy of activation to reach it, as illustrated in Figure 9.14.

whether H means 1H or is a generic symbol for any isotope of hydrogen.

reactions to be about 7-fold slower for C—2H than for C—1H
bonds.
The type of isotope effect that we have considered is called
a primary isotope effect, and in the terminology commonly used
the calculation leads us to expect that the primary deuterium
isotope effect for a C—H bond should be about 7. Similar
calculations indicate that the corresponding tritium isotope
effect should be about 16.5, and that all primary isotope ef-
fects for other elements (for 17O compared with 16O, for ex-
ample) should be much smaller (Table 9.2). These calculations
are subject to considerable error, because the full theory of
the origin of kinetic isotope effects is much more complicated
than that outlined above. However, the deuterium and tri-
tium isotope effects often deviate from the expected values
in a consistent way, so that they are related by the following
equation obtained by Swain and co-workers, often called the
Swain–Schaad equation:

So, for example, if the deuterium isotope effect is 5 rather than
7 we expect the tritium isotope effect to be about 51.442 = 10.

Equation 9.13 is expected to be obeyed if two conditions
are fulﬁlled: ﬁrst, that the reaction is “kinetically simple”,
in other words that the isotope effects are due to a single
step in the mechanism, and second that hydrogen tunneling is
negligible. This is a quantum mechanical property whereby
small particles, most notably electrons but to a much smaller
extent particles as massive as protons, have a ﬁnite probabil-
ity of being found on the opposite side of an energy barrier
from where they are expected to be. This property can be
quite signiﬁcant for 1H, smaller for 2H, and much smaller or
negligible for 3H and heavier atoms. Tunneling causes the
exponent in equation 9.13 to be larger than 1.442. By contrast,
kinetic complications, or effects due to two or more steps in
the reaction, causes some averaging out of the effects on the
individual steps, resulting in an observed exponent smaller
than 1.442. For example, Karsten and co-workers, who used a

different (but equivalent) form of equation 9.13 in which the
expected exponent was 3.26 rather than 1.442 (see Problem 9.2
at the end of this chapter), found an observed exponent of 2.2
in a study of a malate dehydrogenase from the worm Ascaris

Figure 9.15. Secondary kinetic isotope effect. Even though a C–H bond may
not be broken in the transition state, the energy curve will not be the same
as in the starting state if the coordination state of the C atom is changed in
forming the transition state, for example from tetrahedral C to trigonal C in
forming a carbonium ion transition state. In this case the energy differences
do not cancel exactly in going from C–1H to C–2H, and a secondary isotope
effect is produced.
9.6.2
Secondary isotope effects
In discussing the reason for primary isotope effects it was
assumed that conversion of a ground state to a transition
state affected only the bond that was stretched in reaction,
but this is too simple. In reality the whole molecule is af-
fected, but by amounts that diminish rapidly as one moves
away from the reaction site. For bonds adjacent to the one
that is broken the vibrational energy levels are a little closer
together for different isotopes than they are in the ground
state. Thus although the isotopic differences almost cancel,
there is a small residual difference in enthalpy of activation
between 1H and 2H. This leads to a correspondingly small
difference in rate, a secondary isotope effect. Such effects are
typically of the order of 1.3, so reactions with 2H attached to
one of the reacting atoms are typically about 30% slower than
the corresponding reactions with 1H, but, depending on the
nature of the transition state, they can also be faster.
The smallness of secondary isotope effects makes them
more difﬁcult to measure than primary effects, and, probably
for that reason, they have been less used in enzymology.
They can, however, provide useful mechanistic information
246
9. Use of Isotopes for Studying Enzyme Mechanisms
not easily available from other kinds of measurement. Many
mechanisms proposed both for ordinary chemical reactions
and for enzyme-catalyzed reactions involve a change of car-
bon coordination (for example, from tetrahedral to trigonal)
when the transition state is formed, and this change can be
detected as a secondary isotope effect by isotopic substitution
of a hydrogen atom bound to the carbon atom involved in
the reaction, even though the C—H bond responsible for
the isotope effect is unchanged by the reaction. Sinnott and
Souchard, for example, used this type of approach to study

9.6.3
Equilibrium isotope effects
Equilibrium isotope effects resemble secondary isotope ef-
fects in that isotopic substitution changes energy levels in
opposite directions on the two sides of the equilibrium, and
consequently they partially cancel. Although they may not
exactly cancel the net effect is normally small, and so equilib-
rium isotope effects are typically small. However, the extent
of cancellation is strongly dependent on the nature of the
reaction, and a table of equilibrium isotope effects in aqueous
solution in the book by Cook and Cleland shows a wide

variety of values from as low as 0.43 for 2H substitution at
a thiol group to 1.24 for 2H substitution at a sugar hemiacetal,
with numerous values close to 1.00. As one should expect,
equilibrium isotope effects for substitution by heavier atoms
are typically much closer to 1.
Cook and Cleland describe these effects in detail, as well
as a method for measuring equilibrium isotope effects as
small as 2% known as equilibrium perturbation, which was
developed originally by Schimerlik and co-workers.

Primary isotope effects in enzyme kinetics
Isotope effects have found increasing use in enzyme studies
as a mechanistic probe. The essential theory is given in an
article by Northrop, and other articles in the same volume,

mining the absolute magnitude
of hydrogen isotope effects”

and a thorough application to triose phosphate isomerase is
described by Albery and Knowles.
Although the detailed analysis can become complicated,
the basic idea is simple enough to be summarized in an ele-
mentary text. It can be presented by reference to the three-
step Michaelis–Menten mechanism (equation 2.30) discussed
in Section 2.7, for which the deﬁnitions of the catalytic and

speciﬁcity constants were given in equations 2.31–2.32 as:
kA
cat =
k2k3
k−2 + k2 + k3
(9.14)
kA =
k1k2k3
k−1k−2 + k−1k3 + k2k3
(9.15)
and similar expressions for the reverse reaction were given
in equations 2.34–2.35. As steady-state experiments only al-
low the four Michaelis–Menten parameters to be determined,
although there are six rate constants in the mechanism, it
might seem impossible to determine the relative contribu-
tions of the different rate constants in equations 9.14–9.15
from such experiments. However, the possibility of making
measurements with isotopically labeled reactants permits a
useful extension. If we make the reasonable assumption that
isotopic substitution in a bond broken in the reaction is likely
to generate a primary isotope effect on the chemical step, but
little or no isotope effects on the binding steps, we can expect
substantial isotope effects on k2 and k−2 but negligible effects
on the other rate constants. This implies that the ratios of
catalytic and speciﬁcity constants for reactants with 1H and
2H can be written as follows:
k

If it is true that there are no isotope effects on the rate con-
stants for binding, the ratio of isotope effects on k2 and k−2
must be equal to the equilibrium isotope effect for the com-
plete reaction.
For simplicity I shall take the equilibrium
isotope effect to be exactly unity, but as it can anyway be
measured independently the analysis that follows can readily
be corrected for equilibrium effects if necessary. Assuming,
then, that k2/k

to give an expression for the ratio of k3/(k−2 + k2) in terms of

9. Use of Isotopes for Studying Enzyme Mechanisms
As k2/k

is unknown, this result may seem of little value.
However, even if the exact value is unknown, the theory
outlined in Section 9.6.1, together with a large body of experi-
§9.6.1, pages 242–244
mental information about isotope effects in chemical systems,
gives us a good idea of what sort of values are likely. Thus, if
we assume a value of 7, it is clear that a measured isotope
effect of the order of 7 (or more) on kcat provides strong
evidence that the chemical step is slow enough to make an ap-
preciable contribution to the observed kinetics at saturation,
whereas a value of the order of 1 indicates that product release
is slow.
Similar arguments can be applied to equation 9.17, but
the magnitude of the isotope effect on the speciﬁcity constant
kA then provides a measure of the relative importance of the
chemical step in comparison not with k3 alone but with k−1
and k3 together. Although this analysis is somewhat more
complicated than for kcat it has the advantage that it can be
applied to 3H as well as to 2H, whereas 3H isotope effects on
kcat cannot be measured, because an enzyme cannot be satu-
rated with a species that is present only in trace quantities.
If equation 9.13, the relationship between 2H and 3H iso-
tope effects, could be trusted, it would provide a way to
overcome the difﬁculty in this analysis that the exact value of
k2/k
2H
2
is unknown, as comparison of the measured isotope
effects for the two isotopes would allow it to be calculated.
Unfortunately, however, it is doubtful whether this relation-
ship applies accurately enough to enzyme reactions for such a
calculation to offer a reliable advance on the more qualitative
analysis suggested above.

tion of the solvent, as described by Schowen. The processes

5In most of chemistry little confusion results from using the word “pro-
ton” both for the 1H nucleus and for the nucleus of any hydrogen isotope,
but this is ambiguous when discussing hydrogen isotope effects. In con-
texts where greater precision is needed, the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry recommends the term hydron for any hydrogen nucleus
without regard to isotope, proton for the 1H nucleus and deuteron for the 2H
nucleus. This usage is followed in this section.

do, but difﬁcult to interpret properly unless one can be sure
which step of a mechanism is being studied.
Simply measuring the rate of a reaction in 1H2O and 2H2O
reveals almost nothing about the mechanism, but measuring
the rate as a function of the mole fraction of 2H2O in isotopic
mixtures of various composition can be more informative.
Naively, one might expect that the value of any rate constant
in such a mixture could be found by linear interpolation
between the values in pure 1H2O and pure 2H2O, but nearly
always the dependence is nonlinear, and it is the shape of the
curve that can reveal mechanistic information.
Consider a mixture of 1H2O and 2H2O in which the mole
fraction of 2H2O is n, so that the [2H2O]/[1H2O] ratio is
n/(1 −n). For an exchangeable hydron in a reactant molecule
AH, the deuteron/proton ratio will also be [A2H]/[A1H]
= n/(1 −n) if the equilibrium constants for protons and
deuterons are the same at that position.
There will nor-
mally be some selection, however, so that the actual ratio is
φn/(1 −n), where φ is a fractionation factor for that exchange-
able position. Such exchange of hydrons can occur not only in
the reactant molecule itself but also in the transition state of a
reaction in which it participates: in this transition state there is
a similar deuteron/proton ratio φ‡n/(1 −n) where φ‡ is now
the fractionation factor for the same exchangeable position.
The total rate of reaction is now the sum of the rates for the
protonated and deuterated species, and so the rate of reaction
is proportional to [1 + φ‡n/(1 −n)]/[1 + φ‡n/(1 −n)], more
conveniently written as (1−n + φ‡n)/ (1−n + φ‡). It follows
that the observed rate constant kn at mole fraction n of 2H2O
may be expressed as a function of n and the ordinary rate
constant kcat in pure 1H2O as follows:
kn = kcat(1 −n + nφ‡)
1 −n + nφ
(9.18)
To this point we have considered just one hydron, but a typ-
ical enzyme molecule contains many exchangeable hydrons,
each of which can in principle contribute to the solvent iso-
tope effect. If all hydrons (including the two in each solvent
molecule) exchange independently, so that the ﬁnal distribu-
tion of protons and deuterons may be calculated according
to simple statistics, the effects of all the different hydrons are
multiplicative and equation 9.18 can be generalized to the
250
9. Use of Isotopes for Studying Enzyme Mechanisms
Gross–Butler equation:
kn = kcat ∏(1 −n + nφ‡
i )
∏(1 −n + nφi)
(9.19)
in which both products are taken over all exchangeable hy-
drons in the system.
In view of the large number of exchangeable hydrons and
hence the large number of terms in each product in equa-
tion 9.19, this equation may seem too complicated to lead to
any usable information. However, great simpliﬁcation results
from two considerations. First, equilibrium isotope effects are
normally small (Section 9.6.3), because the effects on energy
§9.6.3, page 246
levels largely balance on the two sides of the equilibrium.
This means that most or all of the fractionation factors φi in
the denominator of equation 9.19 are close to unity. Second,
for hydrons not directly affected in the reaction, these effects
cancel in comparing the ground state with the transition state,
very largely for secondary isotope effects (Section 9.6.2), and
§9.6.2, pages 245–246
completely for more remote hydrons. This means that many
of the fractionation factors in the numerator of equation 9.19
are also close to unity.
In the end, therefore, most of the
contribution to equation 9.19 comes from a small number of
hydrons that are altered in the transition state, and to a good
approximation one can often write the equation as follows:
kn = kcat ∏(1 −n + nφ‡
i )
(9.20)
where the product is now taken over those hydrons with
values signiﬁcantly different from unity (the others can still
of course be included, but they do not affect the result).
For a one-hydron transition state, equation 9.20 gives a
straight line dependence of kn on n, for a two-hydron transi-
tion state it gives a quadratic dependence, and so on. Thus in
simple cases, the shape of the curve obtained provides a way
of counting the hydrons involved in the rate-limiting step of
a reaction. For this reason the type of experiment is often
known as a proton inventory, or, more accurately, as a hydron
inventory. A study of a phospholipase from the bacterium
Bacillus cereus provides an example. Martin and Hergenrother

rother (1999) “Catalytic cycle of

ﬁrst established that hydron transfer was involved in a slow
step in the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme, and then exam-
ined the rates in mixtures of 1H2O and 2H2O: they found a
straightforward linear dependence of the mole fraction of 2H,
and concluded that the results were consistent with transfer
of a single hydron in the rate-limiting step.
9.8 Solvent isotope effects
251
One should be careful about stretching this theory too
far, as several assumptions were needed to arrive at equation
equation 9.19, and further ones to get to equation 9.20. More-
over, the theory was developed in relation to an elementary
rate constant of a reaction, but in enzyme applications it often
has to be applied to less fundamental quantities. Many other
complications can arise in enzyme reactions, so that it is by
no means always true that equilibrium isotope effects are
negligible or that reactions in 2H2O are slower than in 1H2O.

Solvent isotope effects in hexokinase D by Pollard-Knight and
Cornish-Bowden offered examples of both exceptions: at low
concentrations of glucose the reaction was about 3.5 times
faster in 2H2O than in 1H2O, and as this inverse isotope effect
persisted (and indeed increased) at low MgATP concentra-
tions it must have been an equilibrium effect.

Solutions and notes are on pages 466–467.
9.1 Sucrose glucosyltransferase catalyzes the reaction of glu-
cose 6-phosphate and fructose to give sucrose and in-
organic phosphate. In the absence of both sucrose and
fructose, the enzyme also catalyzes rapid 32P exchange
between glucose 1-phosphate and labeled inorganic phos-
phate, with strong competitive inhibition by glucose. The
enzyme is a rather poor catalyst for the hydrolysis of glu-
cose 1-phosphate. How may these results be explained?
9.2 The equation k1H/k3H = (k1H/k2H)1.442 allows calcula-
tion of the expected value of a 1H/3H isotope effect when
the corresponding 1H/2H isotope effect is known. How
can the equation be modiﬁed to express the 1H/3H iso-
tope effect in terms of a measured 2H/3H isotope effect?
9.3 The method described in Section 9.7 allows information
§9.7, pages 246–248
about the relative magnitudes of the rate constants for
the binding and chemical steps in a mechanism to be
deduced.
Chemical substitution in the reactive bond
would also be expected to alter the rate constants for the
chemical step, so why can it not be used to obtain the
same sort of information as one can get from isotopically
substituted substrates? Why is the method dependent on
isotopic substitution?

of understanding of hydrogen-ion concentration, [H+].
In
aqueous chemistry, [H+] varies from about 1 M to about 10−14
M, an enormous range that is commonly decreased to more
manageable proportions by the use of a logarithmic scale, pH
= −log [H+]. All enzymes are profoundly inﬂuenced by pH,
and no substantial progress could be made in the understand-
ing of enzymes until Michaelis and his collaborators made pH
control a routine part of all serious enzyme studies. The con-

10. Effect of pH on Enzyme Activity
of pH effects in enzyme kinetics, the practical importance of
pH continues undiminished: it is hopeless to attempt any
kinetic studies without adequate control of pH.
S
ØREN PETER LAURITZ
SØRENSEN (1868–1939)
was born near Slagelse
(Denmark), and studied ﬁrst
medicine and then chemis-
try in Copenhagen. He
made his career at the
Carlsberg Laboratories,
where he was particularly
interested in amino acids
and proteins. The effect of
temperature on enzyme
activity was already reason-
ably well understood, but
Sørensen realized that this
was far from being the only
factor, and that there was an
urgent need for developing
methods for measuring and
controlling the concentra-
tion of hydrogen ions.
It may seem surprising that it was left to enzymologists
to draw attention to the importance of hydrogen-ion concen-
tration and to introduce the use of buffers. We may reﬂect,
therefore, on the special properties of enzymes that made pH
control imperative before any need for it had been felt in the
already highly developed science of chemical kinetics. With
a few exceptions, such as pepsin and alkaline phosphatase,
the enzymes that have been most studied are active only in
aqueous solution at pH values in the range 5–9. Indeed, only
pepsin has a physiologically important activity outside this
middle range of pH. Now, in the pH range 5–9, the hydrogen-
ion and hydroxide-ion concentrations are both in the range
10−5–10−9 M, low enough to be very sensitive to impurities.
Whole-cell extracts, and crude enzyme preparations in gen-
eral, are well buffered by enzyme and other polyelectrolyte
impurities, but this natural buffering is lost when an enzyme
is puriﬁed, and must be replaced with artiﬁcial buffers. Until
this effect was recognized, little progress in enzyme kinetics
was possible. This situation can be contrasted with that in
general chemistry: only a minority of reactions are studied
in aqueous solution and of these most are studied at either
very low or very high pH, with the concentration of either
hydrogen or hydroxide ion high enough to be reasonably sta-
ble. Consequently, the early development of chemical kinetics
was little hampered by the lack of understanding of pH.
The simplest type of pH effect on an enzyme, involving
only a single acidic or basic group, is no different from the
general case of hyperbolic inhibition and activation that was
considered in Section 6.7.4.
Conceptually, the protonation
§6.7.4, pages 155–157
of a basic group on an enzyme is simply an example of the
binding of a modiﬁer at a speciﬁc site and there is therefore
no need to repeat the algebra.
However, there are several
differences between protons and other modiﬁers that make
it useful to examine protons separately. First, all enzymes are
affected by protons, so that the proton is far more important
than any other modiﬁer.
It is far smaller than any other
chemical species and has no steric effect; this means that
certain phenomena, such as pure noncompetitive inhibition
(Section 6.2.2), are common with the proton as inhibitor but
§6.2.2, pages 136–139
rare otherwise. The proton concentration can be measured
and controlled over a much greater range than that available
for any other modiﬁer and therefore one can expect to be
10.2 Acid–base properties of proteins
255
able to observe any effects that may exist. Finally, protons
normally bind to many sites on an enzyme, so that it is often
insufﬁcient to consider binding at one site only.
There is an important difference between the concentra-
tion and the activity of any ion, including the proton, and
strictly it is the activity that should appear in thermodynamic
and kinetic equations, not the concentration. For the proton,
for example, the activity aH+ is given by
aH+ = γH+[H+]
in which γH+ is the activity coefﬁcient. As long as the ionic
strength and temperature are maintained constant, however,
the activity coefﬁcients are also constant, which means that
the pH differs from the value −log aH+ given, for example,
by a pH meter, by a constant. The necessary correction is not
large but it is also not negligible: at the typical ionic strength
of 0.5 mol l−1 used in many biochemical experiments the pH
is about −log aH+ −0.12 for temperatures in the range 10–
40◦C. Alberty provides a fuller discussion, with more numer-

ical information, and considering also the important question
of the activities of multiply-charged ions.
A different complication needs to be borne in mind for
studies at high temperatures in which the ion of interest is not
H+ but OH−(for example when comparing enzyme catalysis
with base catalysis). We normally assume that
[H+][OH−] = Kw = 10−14
This is strictly true only at 24 ◦C, and is not grossly in error
in the range 15–40 ◦C. However, Kw is about 10−15 at 0 ◦C
and about 10−13 at 60 ◦C, with larger deviations from 10−14
at higher temperatures. These discrepancies are big enough
to make it important for appropriate corrections to be made
when calculating OH−from the pH over a range of tempera-
tures.
10.2
Acid–base properties of proteins
Students encounter various deﬁnitions of acids and bases
during courses of chemistry or biochemistry. Unfortunately
J. N. Brönsted (1923) “Einige
Bemerkungen über den Begriff
der Säuren und Basen” Recueil
des Travaux Chimiques des Pays-
Bas 42, 718–728
it is not always made clear that they are not all equivalent
or that the only one that matters for understanding the prop-
erties of enzymes, and indeed most other molecules found
in living systems, is the proposal of Brønsted that an acid is
256
10. Effect of pH on Enzyme Activity
a species with a tendency to lose a proton, whereas a base
is a species with a tendency to gain a proton. Apart from
its emphasis on the proton, this deﬁnition is noteworthy in
referring to species, which includes ions as well as molecules.
Unfortunately, biochemists have conventionally classiﬁed the
ionizable groups found in proteins according to the properties
of the amino acids in the pure uncharged state. Accordingly,
aspartate and glutamate, which are largely responsible for the
basic properties of proteins under physiological conditions,
are commonly referred to as “acidic”. Of the so-called “ba-
sic” amino acids, histidine can act either as an acid or as a
base under physiological conditions, lysine acts primarily as
an acid, and arginine is largely irrelevant to the acid–base
properties of proteins,2 because it does not lose its proton
at pH values below 12. On the other hand, two of the so-
called “neutral” amino acids, cysteine and tyrosine, do make
appreciable contributions to the acid–base properties of pro-
teins. If the object of the standard terminology had been to
make discussion of these properties as difﬁcult as possible to
understand it could hardly have been more successful. An
attempt at a more rational classiﬁcation is given in Figure 10.1.
It has almost nothing in common with that found in most
general biochemistry textbooks, but is instead based on the
Brønsted deﬁnition.
Some of the groups included in Figure 10.1, such as the
J. Steinhardt and J. A. Reynolds
(1969) Multiple Equilibria in
Proteins, pages 176–213,
Academic Press, New York
C-terminal carboxylate and the ε-ammonio group of lysine,
have pKa values so far from 7 that it might seem unlikely that
they would contribute to the catalytic properties of enzymes.
The values given in the table are average values for “typical”
environments, however, and may differ substantially from
the pKa values of individual groups in special environments,
such as the vicinity of the active site. Such pKa values are
said to be perturbed.
A clear-cut example is provided by
pepsin, which has an isoelectric point of 1.4. As there are four
groups that presumably bear positive charges at low pH (one
lysine residue, two arginine residues and the N-terminal),

there must be at least four groups with pKa values well below
the range expected for carboxylic acids. Although the enzyme
contains a phosphorylated serine residue, this can only partly
account for the low isoelectric point, and there must be at least
three perturbed carboxylic acid groups. A possible explana-
tion is that if two acidic groups are held in close proximity

of other groups in its vicinity.

Individual residues in special environments may be “perturbed”, and may
have pKa values substantially different from those shown here. The right-

is largely outside this classiﬁcation as its typical pKa value is too far from

more commonly called an amino group, but this name refers to the uncharged

The pH behavior of many enzymes can be interpreted as
a ﬁrst approximation in terms of a simple model due to
Michaelis, in which only two ionizable groups are considered.
The enzyme may be represented as a dibasic acid, HEH,

Figure 10.2. Dissociation of a

With the dissociation constants deﬁned as shown, the con-
centrations of all forms of the enzyme can be represented at
equilibrium in terms of the hydrogen-ion concentration, [H+],
which will be written for algebraic convenience simply as h in
this chapter:
[EH−] = [HEH] · K11
h
[HE−] = [HEH] · K12
h
[E2−] = [HEH] · K11K22
h2
= [HEH] · K12K21
h2
Two points should be noted about these relationships. First,
although K11 and K21 both deﬁne the dissociation of a proton
from the same group, HE−is more negative than HEH by
one unit of charge, and so it ought to be less acidic, with K11
> K21, not K11 = K21; for the same reason we should expect
that K12 > K22. Second, the concentration of E2−must be the
same whether it is derived from HEH via EH−or via HE−;
the two expressions for [E2−] in equation 9.3 must therefore
be equivalent, with K11K22 = K12K21.

10.3.2
Molecular dissociation constants
In a real experiment, the curves can never be deﬁned as
precisely as those used for calculating the curves in Figure
10.3, because the four dissociation constants cannot be eval-
uated. The reason for this can be seen by recognizing that
[EH−]/[HE−] = K11/K12 is a constant independent of h. Thus
no amount of variation in h will produce a change in [EH−]
that is not accompanied by an exactly proportional change
in [HE−]. Consequently, it is impossible to know how much
of any given property is contributed by EH−and how much
by HE−,3 and for most practical purposes we must therefore
treat EH−and HE−as a single species, and to redraw Figure
10.2 as Figure 10.4, so that they are no longer distinguished.4

of them in the succeeding sections. It seems less confusing, however, to deﬁne
a new symbol H1E−.

The curves were calculated

determines its shape. (Notice
that the plateau around the

this difference increases).
in Figure 10.3 are of this form, and a representative set of bell-
shaped curves for different values of (pK2 −pK1) is given in
Figure 10.5. Notice that the shapes of the curves are not all the
same: the maximum becomes noticeably ﬂat as (pK2 −pK1)
increases, whereas the proﬁle approaches an inverted V as it
becomes small or negative. The maximum is noticeably less
than 1 unless (pK2 −pK1) is greater than about 3.
Conse-
quently the values of the pH at which [EH−] + [HE−] has half
its maximum value are not equal to pK1 and pK2. However,
the mean of these two pH values is equal to (pK1 + pK2)/2,
and is also the pH at which the maximum occurs.
H. B. F. Dixon (1976) “The
unreliability of estimates of
group dissociation constants”
Biochemical Journal 153, 627–629
A convenient method for calculating the pKa difference
from the width at half height is to deﬁne the width at half
height as 2 log q and then calculate pK2 −pK1 as 2 log(q −4 +
1/q), as suggested by Dixon, and the relationship between the
width and the pKa difference is shown in Table 10.1. This table
allows measurement of the pH values where the ordinate
is half-maximal to be converted into molecular pKa values.
Nonetheless, even if pK1 and pK2 are correctly estimated, the
values of the group dissociation constants remain unknown,
unless plausibility arguments are invoked, with untestable
assumptions.

other words if loss of a proton from one group increases the
tendency to lose it from the other. This is not impossible, but
it is not common, as it requires strong compensatory inter-
actions to overcome the electrostatic effects; as an example,

value that (pK2 −pK1) can have without cooperativity is +0.6,
corresponding to a width of 1.53 at the half height. In practice
therefore we should expect bell-shaped curves any sharper
than this to be unusual.
10.4
Effect of pH on enzyme kinetic constants
10.4.1
Underlying assumptions
The bell-shaped activity curves that are often observed for
the enzyme kinetic constants V and V/Km can be accounted
for by a simple extension of the theory of the ionization of a
dibasic acid. (The treatment of Km is more complicated, as we
shall see). The basic mechanism is as shown in Figure 10.6.
The free enzyme is again treated as a dibasic acid, H2E, with
two molecular dissociation constants, KE1 and KE2, and the
enzyme–substrate complex H2E dissociates similarly, with
molecular dissociation constants KEA1 and KEA2. Only the
singly ionized complex H1EA−is able to react to give prod-
ucts, though substrate binding can occur in any ionic state. As
we shall now be working solely with molecular dissociation
constants, we no longer need to distinguish between the two
possible forms of singly deprotonated enzyme: H1E−refers to
both of two species HE−and EH−, and the enzyme–substrate
complex H1EA−is to be understood similarly.
Before proceeding further, I emphasize that Figure 10.6
incorporates some assumptions that may be oversimpliﬁca-
tions. The protonation steps are represented by equilibrium
constants, not by pairs of rate constants, with the implication

that they are equilibria, equivalent to assuming that they are
fast compared with the other steps. This may seem to be a rea-
sonable assumption, in view of the simple nature of the reac-
tion, and will often be true, but it is certainly not always true,
especially if protonation causes a compulsory change of con-
formation. In simple treatments the question is often evaded
by omitting the steps for binding of substrate to H2E and
E2−(Figure 10.7): the protonation steps then become dead-
end reactions, and hence necessarily equilibria according to
the arguments of Section 5.7.3. However, there is usually no

basis for supposing that substrate cannot bind directly to the
different ionic states of the enzyme, and so the assumption
is made more for convenience than because it is likely to be
true. Omitting the ﬁrst and third substrate-binding steps is
thus just a way of evading a legitimate question, not a way of
answering it. If these steps are included, as they should be,
it is important to avoid assigning rate constants that violate
the principle of microscopic reversibility (Section 5.6): in this

Figure 10.7. Simpliﬁed version
of the mechanism in Figure 10.6
involves only two steps, as in the simplest Michaelis–Menten
mechanism. If several steps are postulated, with each inter-
mediate capable of protonation and deprotonation, the form
of the ﬁnal rate equation is not changed, but the interpre-
tation of experimental results becomes more complicated as
each experimental dissociation constant is the mean of the
values for the different intermediates, weighted in favor of
the predominant ones.
(Compare the effect of introducing
an extra step into the simple Michaelis–Menten mechanism,
Section 2.7.1).
Lastly, it may not always be true that only
§2.7.1, pages 54–58
H1EA−can undergo the chemical reaction to give products,
but this is likely to be a reasonable assumption for many
enzymes because most enzyme activities do approach zero
at high and low pH values. If H2EA could also react, with,
for example, 10% of the activity of H1EA−, then we should
expect the enzyme to have ﬁnite activity at low pH, more
than 10% of the activity at the maximum, in fact, because, as
should be evident from the discussion in Section 10.3.3, the
§10.3.3, pages 260–261
activity at the maximum is less than the value for an enzyme
that is completely in the most active ionic state. This sort of
behavior is not unknown, but it is sufﬁciently rare to make
it reasonable to take it as a working hypothesis that only the
singly protonated state is reactive.
10.4.2
pH dependence of V and V/Km
Recognizing that Figure 10.7 may be an optimistic representa-
tion of reality, let us consider the rate equation that it predicts.
If there were no ionizations, and H1E−and H1EA−were the
only forms of the enzyme, then the mechanism would be the
ordinary Michaelis–Menten mechanism, with a rate given by

1 are the pH-
independent parameters.5 In reality, however, the free enzyme
does not exist solely as H1E−, nor the enzyme–substrate com-
plex solely as H1EA−. The full rate equation is of exactly the
same form as equation 10.2:
v =
Va
Km + a
but the parameters V and Km are not equal to ˜V and ˜Km;
instead they are functions of h, and the expressions for V and
V/Km are of the same form as equation 10.1:

Notice that the pH behavior of V reﬂects the ionization of
the enzyme–substrate complex, whereas that of V/Km reﬂects
that of the free enzyme (or the free substrate, as discussed
in Section 10.5). With either parameter the pH dependence
§10.5, page 268
follows a symmetrical bell-shaped curve of the type discussed
in the previous section. The pH at which the curve passes
through a maximum is often called the pH optimum, but this
term should be used with caution. As the curves for V and
V/Km reﬂect different forms of the enzyme there is no reason
for the curves to have maxima at the same pH value, so the
pH optimum is not usually unique.
Moreover, if it refers
simply to the pH at which a curve of initial rate v measured
at a particular substrate concentration passes through a max-
imum then it may not refer to a Michaelis–Menten parameter
at all. Nonetheless, such a pH optimum may be useful for
planning experiments.

term, and would prefer to call them pH-corrected parameters. However, I have
never persuaded anyone else that this would be a better name.

pH-independent parameters and their
relationship to “apparent” parameters
The relationship between true and pH-independent parame-
ters just introduced exactly parallels that between true and ex-
pected values considered in relation to nonproductive bind-
ing (Section 6.9.1); however, it also parallels the distinction
§6.9.1, pages 159–162
made in many other contexts between apparent and true
values (respectively!). This may seem to be inconsistent: why
do we say that the “true” values of the Michaelis–Menten
parameters in an inhibition experiment are those that apply in
the absence of inhibitor, whereas in a pH-dependence study
they are the values that apply at the particular pH considered?
It is quite possible to insist on a greater degree of consis-
tency, but this creates more problems than it solves, and as in
other areas of chemistry it is more proﬁtable to sacriﬁce strict
consistency in favor of convenience: in thermodynamics, for
example, we deﬁne the standard state of most species in
solution as a concentration of 1 M, but we make an exception
of the solvent, taking its standard state as the concentration
that exists; in biochemistry, but not chemistry, we extend
this to the proton, recognizing that equilibrium constants and
standard Gibbs energy changes make much more biochemical
sense if they refer to a standard state at pH 7 (Alberty and
Cornish-Bowden provide a fuller discussion of this point).

Bowden (1993) “The pH
dependence of the apparent
equilibrium constant, K′, of a
biochemical reaction” Trends in
Biochemical Sciences 18, 288–291
An implication of deﬁning pH 7 as the biochemical stan-
dard state is that biochemical equations cannot be balanced
according to the same rules as chemical equations, because
charges cannot be balanced if the pH is ﬁxed.
It is quite
correct, for example, to write the hydrolysis of ATP as
ATP + H2O = ADP + phosphate
as a biochemical equation, but it is not correct to write it as
ATP4−+ H2O = ADP3−+ HPO2−
4
+ H+
unless this is intended as a chemical equation and the pH is
free to change. Similar considerations apply to other ions,
such as Mg2+, if they are buffered so that concentrations are
not free to change in the reaction. This is more a matter of
thermodynamics than kinetics, and will not be taken further
here, but there is a full discussion in a recent paper by Alberty
and co-workers.

In relation to the pH-dependence of Michaelis–Menten pa-
rameters, there is an important difference between the proton

and other inhibitors. For most inhibitors, it is perfectly feasi-
ble to study the reaction in the absence of the inhibitor, and
perfectly reasonable, therefore, to deﬁne the true parameters
as those that apply in that case. It is not possible, however, to
observe enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the absence of protons;
moreover, because protons usually activate enzymes as well
as inhibit them (whereas other enzyme effectors more often
inhibit than activate) one cannot even determine the proton-
free behavior by extrapolation.
Ultimately all distinctions
between constants and variables in biochemistry are matters
of convenience rather than laws of nature, and apart from
a few fundamental physical constants this is true of most
“constants” in science: even in physical chemistry the temper-
ature, for example, is not part of the deﬁnition of a standard
state, and so equilibrium “constants” vary with the tempera-
ture.

pH dependence of Km

values by plotting log Km against pH and applying a theory
developed by Dixon. To understand this approach6 it is best
to regard Km as V divided by V/Km, or to regard log Km as
log V −log (V/Km). Then an examination of how log V and
log (V/Km) vary with pH leads naturally to an understand-
ing of the pH dependence of Km.
It is obvious from inspection that at high h (low pH)
equation 10.3 simpliﬁes to V = KEA1/h and that at low h
(high pH) it simpliﬁes to V = h/KEA2. If KEA1 and KEA2 are
well separated there is also an intermediate region in which
V ≈˜V. It follows that the plot of log V against pH should
take the form shown at the top of Figure 10.8, approximating
6This analysis raises obvious questions of dimensional inconsistency
(Section 1.3). However, although these mean that the ordinate values of all
the line segments in Figure 10.8 are arbitrarily dependent on the units, they
do not affect the abscissa values of the points where the slopes change, and
that is enough to make the analysis valid.

to three straight-line segments intersecting at pH = pKEA1 and
pH = pKEA2. The behavior of V/Km, shown in the middle
part of Figure 10.8, is similar, except that the intersections
occur at pH = pKE1 and pH = pKE2. Despite the complicated
appearance of equation 10.5, therefore, the form of the plot of
log Km against pH follows simply by subtraction, and must
be as shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure.
The plot approximates to a series of straight-line segments,
each with slope +1, 0 or –1 (slopes of +2 or –2 are also possible,
though they do not occur in Figure 10.8). As one reads across
this segmented version of the plot from left to right, each
increase in slope corresponds to a pKa on the free enzyme,
either pKE1 or pKE2, and each decrease in slope corresponds
to pKa on the enzyme–substrate complex, either pKEA1 or
pKEA2. Expressed somewhat differently, and as indicated by
the curved arrows in Figure 10.8, each clockwise turn in the
line (reading from left to right) corresponds to an ionization of
the enzyme–substrate complex, whereas each anticlockwise
turn corresponds to an ionization of the free enzyme.

magniﬁed view of the region

is shown above the main plot.
The plots shown in Figure 10.8 are idealized, in the sense
that the pKa values are well separated (by at least 1 pH unit
in each example) and the data span a wide enough range of
pH for all four changes of slope to be easily seen. In the ideal
case the curves pass so close to the straight-line segments that
they are barely visible in Figure 10.8, and a magniﬁed view is
shown in Figure 10.9, where it may be seen that the line misses
the theoretical intersection point by log 2 ≈0.3 logarithmic
units. When there are two or more pK values differing by less
than about 2 pH units (Figure 10.10) it becomes difﬁcult to
locate the horizontal segment accurately. For these reasons it
would be unusual to have accurate data over a wide enough
range in a real experiment to estimate all four pKa values.
However, the interpretation of changes in slope is the same
even if only part of the plot is available.

10.4.5
Experimental design
To have any hope of yielding meaningful mechanistic infor-
mation, pH-dependence curves should refer to parameters
of the Michaelis–Menten equation or another equation that
describes the behavior at each pH. (Better still, they should
refer to individual identiﬁed steps in the mechanism, but this
is not often realizable). In other words, a series of initial rates
should be measured at each pH value, so that V and V/Km
can be determined at each pH value. The pH dependence
10.4 Effect of pH on enzyme kinetic constants
267
of v is of little value by itself because competing effects on
V and V/Km can make any pKa values supposedly measured
highly misleading. In this respect measurements of the effects
of pH should follow the same principles as measurements of
the effects of changes in other environmental inﬂuences on
enzymes, such as temperature, ionic strength, concentrations
of inhibitors and activators, and so on. These last variables

It is not possible to characterize
the pH behavior of an enzyme

there may be effects due to the

pH, so it is important to have
some overlap region so that any
discontinuities in the cures are

should of course be properly controlled, as in any kinetic
experiment, but the ionic strength deserves special mention
because the use of several different buffer systems necessary
to span a broad range of pH may make it difﬁcult to main-
tain a constant ionic strength: if this cannot be maintained
constant then separate experiments need to be done to check
that variations in ionic strength cannot explain any effects
attributed to variations in pH.

a single ionizing group should not be used at pH values more
than one unit from the pKa of that group, which imposes a
maximum range of two pH units for the range accessible with
any such buffer. Taking the representative values shown in
Table 10.2 as an example, therefore, it will be seen that a buffer
system based on acetate and triethanolamine would be very
unsatisfactory, because of the substantial pH range between
5.6 and 6.7 in which neither buffer would be effective. Thus
two or more buffers are usually needed to characterize an
enzyme, and the ranges used for the different ones should
overlap sufﬁciently for effects due to the identity of the buffer
(rather than to the pH itself) to be obvious (Figure 10.11).
More detail on the use of buffers may be found in specialized
articles such as that of Price and Stevens.
Preliminary characterization of the pH behavior of an en-
zyme is sometimes done in a way that is even less meaningful
than measuring v as a function of pH, by measuring extent of
reaction after a ﬁxed time as a function of pH. It is becoming
rare to ﬁnd data published in this form, but in the older lit-
erature potentially interesting information is sometimes ren-
dered virtually unusable because this type of experimental
design was used, for example in studies of pepsin substrates
by Inouye and co-workers.
At best, an extent of reaction
may give an indication of the initial rate, but it is likely to
be complicated by variations in the degree of curvature (from
whatever cause) in the different experiments.

Ionization of the substrate
Many substrates ionize in the pH range used in kinetic ex-
periments.
If substrate ionization is possible one ought to
consider whether observed pKa values refer to the enzyme or

ization and the results given above require only slight modi-
ﬁcation. The pH dependence of V, and decreases in slope in
plots of log Km against pH, still refer to the enzyme–substrate
complex; but the pH dependence of V/Km, and increases in
slope in plots of log Km against pH, may refer either to the free
enzyme or to the free substrate. One may sometimes decide
which interpretation is correct by studying another substrate
that does not ionize.
For example (Figure 10.12), the pH
dependence of kcat/Km for the pepsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of
acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanylglycine shows pKa val-
ues of 1.1 and 3.5, of which the latter may well be due to
ionization of the substrate.
The correctness of this interpretation is conﬁrmed by
consideration of a substrate that does not ionize, acetyl-L-
phenylalanyl-L-phenylalaninamide: this has essentially the
same value for pK1, 1.05, but a higher value of pK2, 4.75
(Figure 10.13), which presumably refers to an ionization of
the enzyme.

In Section 10.3.2 we saw that it is in theory impossible to
distinguish between enzyme forms with the same degree of
protonation. Figure 10.3 is reproduced here as Figure 10.14,
slightly edited to emphasize the curves for EH−and HE−.
The lines for these two enzyme forms have the same shape,
so that at whatever pH value the line for one is at, say, 37%
of its maximum value the other is also at 37% of its maximum
value. More generally, pH measurements can reveal infor-
mation about proton stoichiometry but not unambiguously
about the locations of the protons concerned. So, for example,
we might have evidence that the active form of an enzyme
had one histidine residue protonated and another deproto-
nated, but the experimental data cannot tell us which way
round they are.
In practice, however, chemical logic will usually indicate
that one possibility suggests a plausible mechanism consis-
tent with the known structure of the enzyme, whereas the
10.7 More complicated pH effects

other does not. An example of this is described by Mellor
and co-workers, who found that to make chemical sense the
pH behavior of calpain needed to be interpreted in terms of a

More complicated pH effects
One of the main reasons for doing pH-dependence studies
is to measure pKa values and deduce from them the chem-
ical nature of the groups on the enzyme that participate in
catalysis.
Although this is widely done, it demands more
caution than it sometimes receives, because simple treatments
of pH effects make several assumptions that may not always
be valid.
It is not only the quantitative assumptions that are suspect;
the qualitative interpretation of a pH proﬁle can also be mis-
leading. For example, although a bell-shaped pH curve may
indicate a requirement for two groups to exist in particular
ionic states, as discussed in Sections 10.4–10.5, this is not the
only possibility: in some circumstances a single group that is
required in different states for two steps of the reaction may
give similar behavior, as discussed by Dixon and by Cornish-
Bowden. This is an example of a change of rate-limiting step
with pH as described by Jencks, and as it can lead to the
mistake of assigning a pKa value to a group that does not in
fact exist in the enzyme or its substrate this type of pKa is
sometimes called a mirage pKa. Other complications are that
a single protonation or deprotonation of the fully active state
may lead to only partial loss of activity, and loss of activity
may require more than one protonation or deprotonation.
Fuller discussion of these and other more complicated pH
effects, see may be found in articles by Tipton and Dixon and
by Brocklehurst. An article by Knowles is particularly valu-
able as a guide to some of the mistakes that can result from
lack of taking sufﬁcient care in the analysis of pH studies, and
some of his points are brought up to date in Brocklehurst’s
review of 1994. Alberty provides many illustrations, includ-
ing some three-dimensional examples, of the effects of pH on
rates and kinetic parameters in his recent book.

• The effects of pH are especially important in enzyme chem-

enzyme-catalyzed reactions are usually studied in aqueous

• The Brønsted deﬁnition of acids and bases is the essential
§10.2, pages 255–257
one for understanding the ionization properties of proteins:
an acid is a species that can donate a proton; a base is a species
that can accept a proton.
• At neutral pH the C-terminal and the sidechains of aspartic
§10.2, pages 255–257
acid and glutamic acid are deprotonated, whereas the N-
terminal and the sidechains of lysine, histidine and argi-
nine are protonated, so their Brønsted properties are opposite
from those of the unionized groups.
• In accordance with the previous point, the principal acidic

groups in proteins are the sidechains of cysteine, tyrosine
and lysine; the principal basic groups are the sidechains of
aspartate and glutamate, together with the C-terminal ;
the sidechain of histidine and the N-terminal can act both
as acids or as bases in the neutral range of pH.
• The ionization of a dibasic acid provides the basis for

• The pH-dependence of V/Km reﬂects ionization of the free

ionization of the enzyme–substrate complex.
• The dependence of Km on pH is typically more complicated
§10.4.4, pages 265–266
than those of V and V/Km, and is most easily understood by
regarding Km as the result of dividing V by V/Km.
Problems
Solutions and notes are on page 467.
10.1 If Km depends on a single ionizing group, with pKa
values pKE in the free enzyme and pKEA in the enzyme–
substrate complex, its dependence on the hydrogen-ion
concentration h is Km = ˜Km(KE + h)/(KEA + h). (a) At
what pH does a plot of Km against pH show a point of

10.2 Interpretation of a plot of log Km against pH is most
easily done in the light of the relationship log Km =
log V −log (V/Km), in which Km, V and V/Km are
not only dimensioned quantities, but they have three
different dimensions. Does this relationship violate the
rules discussed in Section 1.3, and, if so, to what extent

have some residual doubts about the answer, plot the
data shown in the margin in the form of plots of log Km
against pH (ignoring the units), and estimate the value of
the pK. Then convert the Km values from mM to M and
repeat: how does the appearance of the plot change? Is
there any change in the estimated pK?
10.3 A bell-shaped pH proﬁle has half-maximal ordinate val-
ues at pH values 5.7 and 7.5. Estimate the molecular
pKa values. If there is independent reason to believe that
one of the group pKa values is 6.1, what can be deduced
about the other three. [This problem is less trivial than it
may appear at ﬁrst sight.]
10.4 Draw a more realistic scheme for pH dependence than
Figure 10.6 by modifying it (a) to allow both substrate
and product to bind to all three forms of free enzyme,
assuming that the rate constants for these binding reac-
tions are independent of the state of protonation; and
(b) to treat the catalytic process as a three-step reaction
in which all steps are reversible, the second step, for in-
terconversion of HEA and HEP, occurring for the singly
protonated complexes only. Assuming that all protona-
tion reactions are at equilibrium in the steady state, use
Cha’s method (Section 5.6) to derive an expression for
§5.6, pages 119–122
Km as a function of the hydrogen-ion concentration. The
solution has a complicated appearance, which can be
simpliﬁed by deﬁning f (h) = 1/[(h/K1) + 1 + (K2/h)].
Under what circumstances is Km independent of pH? If
it is independent of pH, what value must it have?

Temperature Effects on
Enzyme Activity
11.1
Temperature denaturation
In principle, the theoretical treatment discussed in Section 1.8
§1.8, pages 15–21
of the temperature dependence of simple chemical reactions
applies equally to enzyme-catalyzed reactions, but in prac-
tice there are several complications that must be properly
understood if any useful information is to be obtained from
temperature-dependence measurements.
First, almost all enzymes become denatured if they are
heated much above physiological temperatures, and the con-
formation of the enzyme is altered, often irreversibly, with
loss of catalytic activity. Denaturation is chemically a compli-
cated and only partly understood process, and only a simpli-
ﬁed account will be given here. In this section I shall limit it to
reversible denaturation, assuming that an equilibrium exists
at all times between the active and denatured enzyme and
that only a single denatured species needs to be taken into
account. However, I emphasize that limiting it to reversible
denaturation is for the sake of simplicity, not because irre-
versible effects are unimportant in practice.
Denaturation does not involve rupture of covalent bonds,
but only of hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions
that are involved in maintaining the active conformation of
the enzyme. Although an individual hydrogen bond is far

weaker than a covalent bond (about 20 kJ · mol−1 for a hydro-

enthalpy of reaction, ∆H0′, is often very high for denatura-
tion, typically 200–500 kJ · mol−1, but the rupture of many
weak bonds greatly increases the number of conformational
states available to an enzyme molecule, and so denaturation
is also characterized by a large standard entropy of reaction,

with temperature according to the van ’t Hoff equation (Sec-
tion 1.8.1):
§1.8.1, pages 15–17
−RT ln K = ∆G0′ = ∆H0′ −T∆S0′
where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature and
∆G0′, ∆H0′ and ∆S0′ are the standard Gibbs energy, enthalpy
and entropy of reaction, respectively. This relationship can be
rearranged to provide an expression for K:

The rate equation k for the catalytic reaction may be governed
by the integrated Arrhenius equation:

where A is a constant and Ea is the Arrhenius activation
energy.
The rate of the catalytic reaction is given by v = k[E][A],
but to use this equation the concentration [E] of active enzyme
has to be expressed in terms of the total concentration e0 =
[E] + [E′], and so

At low temperatures, when ∆S0′/R is small compared with

nary way according to the Arrhenius equation. At tempera-
tures above ∆H0′/∆S0′, however, the denominator increases
steeply with temperature and the rate of reaction decreases.

This behavior is illustrated in Figure 11.3.

Irreversible denaturation
For the sake of simplicity the previous section treated thermal
denaturation as a reversible equilibrium (Figure 11.1), but in
reality it is likely to be irreversible, at least in part, and Figure
11.2 shows a more realistic model. We do not need to analyze
the kinetics of this mechanism in detail, because the essen-
tial points are evident from inspection: ﬁrst, at sufﬁciently
short periods of exposure to the denaturing temperature the
behavior will be as predicted with the simpler model; second,
denaturation is likely to be time-dependent, with greater loss
of activity for longer times.

Temperature optimum
Although the model of Figure 11.1 is oversimpliﬁed, it ex-
plains why the Arrhenius equation appears to fail for enzyme-
catalyzed reactions at high temperatures. Optimum tempera-
tures were often reported for enzymes in the older literature,
and this is still occasionally seen today. However, the tem-
perature at which kobs is a maximum has no particular signif-
icance, as the temperature dependence of enzyme-catalyzed
reactions is often found to vary with the experimental pro-
cedure. In particular, the longer a reaction mixture is incu-
bated before analysis the lower the “optimum temperature”
is likely to be because of the characteristics in Figure 11.2, in
which the denaturation reaction is not an equilibrium. At low
temperatures, therefore, the extent of reaction may approach
276
11. Temperature Effects on Enzyme Activity
equilibrium if given enough time, but at high temperatures
the reaction ceases long before equilibrium is reached (Figure
11.4). The extent of denaturation therefore increases with the
time of incubation.
This ought not to be a problem with
modern experimental techniques, because in continuously
assayed reaction mixtures time-dependent processes are usu-
ally obvious.
However, if it is not taken into account, for

example, if one takes the average rate of reaction during a
speciﬁed time period as a measure of the initial rate (not a
good idea for various reasons: see Figure 11.5, which repro-
duces Figure 4.3 from Section 4.1.2) then the temperature that
appears to be optimal will vary with the time period chosen
(Figure 11.6).

phosphoglycerate kinases from various bacteria and found re-
versible decreases in activity with increased temperature be-
fore reaching temperatures at which irreversible denaturation
became appreciable.
Subsequently Daniel and co-workers
studied this and various other examples and proposed a
plausible model to account for them. They suggested that
the active form of the enzyme exists in equilibrium with an
inactive form, with a temperature dependence of the equi-
librium that increases the proportion of inactive form with
temperature. The maximum in the activity occurs because
at low temperatures the normal Arrhenius increase in activ-
ity is more important than the effect of temperature on the
equilibrium, whereas at high temperatures the reverse is true.
In practice, as the authors point out, irreversible temperature
denaturation of both forms of the enzyme is likely to occur
as well, but this does not invalidate the major point that a
genuine maximum in the activity curve may occur even at
zero time. These ideas are developed more fully in a more
recent article by Daniel and Danson, in which Figure Ia of Box
2 shows that Figure 11.4 oversimpliﬁes reality to some degree.
11.4
Application of the Arrhenius equation to
enzymes
Because of denaturation, straightforward results can usually
be obtained from studies of the temperature dependence of
enzymes only within a fairly narrow range of temperature,
say 0–50 ◦C at best, but even within this range there are
11.4 Application of the Arrhenius equation to enzymes

important hazards to be avoided. First, the temperature de-
pendence of the initial rate commonly gives curved Arrhenius
plots, from which little useful information can be obtained.
Such plots often show artifacts, as discussed, for example,
by Silvius and co-workers, and a minimum requirement for a

rane enzymes: artifacts in

satisfactory temperature study is to measure a series of rates
at each temperature, so that Arrhenius plots can be drawn
for the separate Michaelis–Menten parameters, V, Km and
V/Km. These plots are also often curved, and there are so
many possible explanations of this—for example, a change
in conformation of the enzyme, the existence of the enzyme
as a mixture of isoenzymes or an effect of temperature on a
substrate—that it is dangerous to conclude much from the
shape of an Arrhenius plot unless it can be correlated with
other temperature effects that can be observed independently.
Massey and co-workers, for example, found sharp changes

in slope at about 14 ◦C in Arrhenius plots for D-amino acid
oxidase; at the same temperature, other techniques, such
as sedimentation velocity and ultraviolet spectroscopy, indi-
cated a change in conformational state of the enzyme. It is
then clearly reasonable to interpret the kinetic behavior as a
consequence of the same change in conformation.
In general one can attach little signiﬁcance to studies of the
temperature dependence of any Michaelis–Menten parameter
unless the mechanistic meaning of this parameter is known.
If Km is a function of several rate constants, its temperature
dependence is likely to be a complicated combination of com-
peting effects, and of little signiﬁcance or interest; but if Km
is known with reasonable certainty to be a true dissociation
constant, its temperature dependence can provide useful ther-
modynamic information about the enzyme.
Most of the “activation energies” for enzyme-catalyzed
reactions that have appeared in the literature have little value,
but it would be wrong to suggest that no useful information
can be obtained from studies of temperature dependence; if
proper care is taken they can lead to valuable information
about enzyme reaction mechanisms.
For example, Bender
and co-workers made a classic study of α-chymotrypsin that
differed substantially from typical temperature-dependence
studies: they obtained convincing evidence of the particular
steps in the mechanism that were affected, they compared re-
sults for numerous different substrates, for an enzyme about
which much was known already, and they interpreted them
with a proper understanding of chemistry.

It should be evident from the preceding discussion that appli-
cation of the Arrhenius or van ’t Hoff equations to enzymes
over a restricted range of temperature is error-prone and li-
able to lead to results of dubious value. Rather surprisingly,
however, estimates of enthalpies and entropies of activation
or of reaction frequently lead to remarkably good correlations
between the two parameters (as for example in Figure 11.7),
whether these are measured for a series of mutants of differ-
ent proteins, or for proteins extracted from a series of different
organisms, or from other series for which there seems no
obvious reason to expect a correlation. This has led to the
popular idea of entropy–enthalpy compensation, also known
as the isokinetic relationship, whereby variations in enthalpy
are supposedly compensated for by variations in enthalpy
to produce approximately the same rate of reaction or equi-
librium constant at a particular temperature. A correlation
as near-perfect as the one shown in Figure 11.7 should raise
the suspicions of any critical observer, because no correlation
between two independently measured biological variables is
ever perfect unless the correlation can be explained as an
artifact of the mathematical analysis.
If the heat is measured directly, as with calorimetric mea-
surements, there may be some value in this concept, but
I shall not discuss that aspect (though Sharp does), being
more concerned with entropy and enthalpy values obtained
from temperature dependence data using the Arrhenius or
the van ’t Hoff equation. Exner exposed the fallacy in this
approach many years ago, and there would be no reason to
mention it at all if it were not that it continues to be used
experimentally.
The essential problem with concluding compensation from
measurements of temperature dependence is that the data
span too narrow a range of temperatures to allow derivation
of two independent thermodynamic parameters. At a casual

inspection the data in Figure 11.8, for example, show an
Arrhenius relationship with a well deﬁned straight line that
allows ∆H‡ to be estimated from the slope and ∆S‡ from the
intercept on the ordinate axis. However, the vertical line in the
plot is not the ordinate axis, as it is drawn at 1000/T = 3.0 K−1.
Estimation of ∆S‡, therefore, requires a very long extrapola-
tion, far to the left of the range illustrated. The experimen-
tal points span the range 1000/T = 3.22 −3.47 K−1, so the
extrapolation needed is 3.22/(3.47 −3.22) = 12.9 times the

is to say at a temperature of about 22 ◦C , but the slope is much
less well deﬁned, and any small error in it will necessarily be
magniﬁed into a large error in the ordinate intercept. In other
words the data deﬁne one piece of information, the activity at
22 ◦C, quite well, but one cannot calculate two supposedly in-
dependent numbers from this single one without generating
a spurious correlation. A less misleading way of presenting
the data, therefore, is as shown in Figure 11.9.
Even completely random data can generate an apparently
impressive compensation plot if the range of temperatures is
similar to that in real biological experiments. For example, I
found that assigning Arrhenius energies of activation falling
randomly in the range 30–160 kJ/mol to 100 “samples” with
activities at 18 ◦C that varied arbitrarily over a tenfold range
resulted in an excellent compensation plot, and even when

The slope of a plot of entropy against enthalpy has the
dimensions of a temperature, and the temperature that results
from measuring it is sometimes called the compensation tem-

pensation is perfect. Conclusions drawn from measurements
of such temperatures are as open to argument as the concept
of compensation itself, and further information may be found
in McBane’s article.

ignore all but the last four digits of each number, and
write each one as a pair of two-digit numbers.

as shown in the margin.
Now treat the ten pairs of
numbers as measurements of the catalytic constant at
5 ◦C and 30 ◦C of samples of an enzyme isolated from
ten different species. For each enzyme estimate the Ar-
rhenius activation energy Ea from the two-point straight
line, and hence calculate the enthalpy of activation from
the following equation (equation 1.19):
∆H‡ = Ea −RT
and ln A as the intercept on the vertical axis. Assume
R = 8.31 J mol−1 K−1, T = 300 K, Nh/RT = 1.6 ×
10−13 s. Plot the resulting values of ln A against the en-
thalpies of activation, and comment on any relationship
that is apparent. (Conversion of ln A to the entropy of
activation by means of equation 1.20 is optional, as this
just deﬁnes the zero of the scale and does not affect the
visual appearance of the result.)

Regulation of Enzyme

Function of cooperative and allosteric
interactions
12.1.1
Futile cycles
All living organisms require a high capacity to regulate meta-
bolic processes so as to permit orderly change without precip-
itating catastrophic progress towards thermodynamic equi-
librium.
Less obviously, enzymes that behave in the way
described in the earlier chapters are unlikely to be capable of
ﬁne enough regulation.
The interconversion of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose
1,6-bisphosphate provides a useful example for illustrating
the essential problem, and for discussing the properties re-
quired for effective regulation. The conversion of fructose 6-
phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate requires ATP:
fructose 6-P + ATP →fructose 1,6-P2 + ADP
It is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase and is the ﬁrst step in
glycolysis that is unique to this pathway, that is to say the
ﬁrst step that does not form part of other metabolic processes
as well. It is thus a suitable step for regulating glycolysis, and,
although the modern view (Section 13.5.1) is that it is an over-

pathway, there is no doubt that phosphofructokinase makes
an important contribution to the regulation of glycolysis in
most cells.
The reaction catalyzed by phosphofructokinase is essen-
tially irreversible under metabolic conditions, and as fruc-
tose 1,6-bisphosphate needs to be converted to fructose 6-
phosphate in gluconeogenesis, this requires a different reac-
tion, hydrolysis catalyzed by fructose bisphosphatase:
fructose 1,6-P2 +H2O →fructose 6-P + Pi
This reaction is also essentially irreversible. The parallel exist-
ence of two irreversible reactions is of the greatest importance
in metabolic regulation: it means that the direction of ﬂux
between two metabolites can be determined by differential
regulation of the activities of the two enzymes.
A single
reversible reaction could not be regulated in this way, be-
cause a catalyst cannot affect the direction of ﬂux through
a reaction, which is determined solely by thermodynamic
considerations.
The catalyst affects only the rate at which
equilibrium can be attained.
If both phosphofructokinase and fructose bisphosphatase
reactions were to proceed in an unregulated fashion at sim-
ilar rates, there would be no net interconversion of fructose
6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, but continuous
hydrolysis of ATP, resulting eventually in death (Figure 12.1).

sion of fructose 6-phosphate
and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
In the cell several regulators act
in opposite directions on the
two enzymes.
This situation has often been known as a futile cycle, and to
prevent it either the two processes must be segregated into
different cells (or different compartments of the same cell), or
both enzymes must be regulated in such a way that each is
active only when the other is inhibited. Many potential cycles
are indeed regulated by compartmentation, but this is not
possible for all in all circumstances, and so there is certainly
a need for the second option. This is the case, for example,
for tissues such as liver that can carry out both glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis.
The term futile cycle has fallen into disfavor in recent
decades, and some authors prefer the less emotive term sub-
strate cycle, because it is now realized that cycling is quite
widespread and that it is by no means necessarily harmful.
As discussed in Section 13.9.2, cycling between active and
§13.9.2, pages 365–366
inactive forms of an enzyme can be an extremely sensitive
mechanism for regulating catalytic activity that easily repays
the small cost in hydrolyzed ATP. Even when the main result
of cycling is to generate heat it is hardly “futile” if it enables

a warm-blooded animal to maintain the temperature needed
for life,1 or if it enables a bumblebee to ﬂy (and gather nectar)
on a cold day.
To conclude this introduction, it is worth mentioning that
metabolic regulation occurs in at least three distinct time do-
mains. Cooperative and allosteric interactions, the topic of
this chapter, are essentially instantaneous, as they are brought
about by the reversible binding of small molecules to enzymes
or by internal interactions within single proteins. However,
they cannot provide a very high degree of regulation. Cova-
lent interconversion between active and inactive forms of the
same enzymes, which will be discussed in Section 13.9.2, is
§13.9.2, pages 365–366
slower and requires input of energy, but offers ﬁner control.
Finally, genetic regulation depends on synthesis and degra-
dation of proteins, and is outside the scope of this book.
12.1.2
Inadequacy of Michaelis–Menten kinetics for
regulation
We must now ask whether an enzyme that obeys the or-
dinary laws of enzyme kinetics can be regulated precisely
enough to prevent futile cycling. For an enzyme that obeys
the Michaelis–Menten equation, v = Va/(Km + a), a simple
calculation shows that the rate is 0.1V when a = Km/9, and
that it is 0.9V when a = 9Km. In other words, an enormous in-
crease in substrate concentration, 81-fold, is required to bring
about a comparatively modest increase in rate from 10% to
90% of the limit, as illustrated in Figure 12.2, using symbols h

Analysis of simple inhibition is a little more complicated,
but the conclusion is very similar. Suppose that a reaction
is subject to competitive inhibition according to the equation
v = Va/[Km(1 + i/Kic) + a]. The ratio of inhibited to un-
inhibited rate may be written as v/v0 = (Km + a)/[Km(1 +
i/Kic) + a], which has values of 0.1 when i = 9Kic(1 + a/Km)
and 0.9 when i = Kic(1 + a/Km)/9: again an 81-fold change
in concentration needed to span the middle 80% of the range
of possible rates.
Even when two or more inhibitors act in concert, the
qualitative conclusion is the same: inordinately large changes
in their concentrations are necessary to bring about even a

lation of metabolism are exactly the opposite, however: on
the one hand, the concentrations of major metabolites must
be maintained within small tolerances, and on the other hand,
reaction rates must be capable of changing greatly—probably
more than the range of 10–90% of the limit just considered—in
response to ﬂuctuations within these small tolerances. The so-
lution adopted in metabolism is to use enzymes with special
kinetic properties that allow useful changes in rate to follow
from relatively small changes in conditions: such enzymes are
commonly called regulatory enzymes and constitute the main
subject of this chapter.

for supplying the degree of control needed for metabolism.
Instead, many enzymes believed to play an important role
in metabolic regulation display the property of responding
with exceptional sensitivity to changes in metabolite concen-
trations. This property is known as cooperativity, because it
can be considered to arise from “cooperation” between the
active sites of oligomeric enzymes. As illustrated in Figure
12.3, the plot of rate against substrate concentration shows a
characteristic sigmoid2 (S-shaped) curve quite different from
the rectangular hyperbola given by the Michaelis–Menten
equation and illustrated in Figure 12.2. Characteristic devi-
ations from straight lines occur likewise in the usual kinetic
plots, as illustrated in Figure 12.4. Notice particularly that the
steepest part of the curve in Figure 12.3 is shifted from the
origin to a positive concentration, typically a concentration
within the physiological range for the metabolite concerned.
This ﬁgure illustrates a mild degree of cooperativity, but the
sigmoidicity can be much more pronounced, as in Figure 12.5.
A major theme of this chapter is to examine the main theories
that have been proposed to account for cooperativity, or, in

other words, to explain curves such as those illustrated.3
2The name refers to the sigma ς used at the end of a word in Greek. The
more familiar forms Σ and σ used in mathematics look nothing like the curve.
3When kinetic observations are plotted with a linear scale of substrate
concentration, as in Figures 12.2–5, a sigmoid curve is an indication of a Hill
coefﬁcient (Section 12.2.1, pages 286–288) greater than 1. If a logarithmic scale
of concentration is used, however, as in Figure 12.6, it is the steepness of
the curve that gives an indication of cooperativity, because in this case the
curve is sigmoid even for Michaelis–Menten kinetics. In referring to sigmoid
binding, therefore, it is important to be clear about the type of scale used.
12.1 Function of regulatory interactions
285
12.1.4
Allosteric interactions
The interconversion of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-
bisphosphate illustrates another important aspect of meta-
bolic regulation, namely that the immediate and ultimate
products of a reaction are usually different. Although ATP is
a substrate of the phosphofructokinase reaction, the effect of
glycolysis as a whole is to generate ATP, in very large amounts
if glycolysis is considered as the route into the tricarboxylate
cycle and electron transport. Thus ATP must be regarded as
a product of glycolysis, even though it is a substrate of one of
the main enzymes at which glycolysis is regulated. Hence
ordinary product inhibition of phosphofructokinase works
in the opposite direction from what is required for efﬁcient
regulation, and to permit a steady supply of metabolic energy
phosphofructokinase ought also to be inhibited by the ulti-
mate product of the pathway, ATP, as, in fact, it is.
J. Monod, J.-P. Changeux and F.
Jacob (1963) “Allosteric proteins
and cellular control systems”
Journal of Molecular Biology 6,
306–329
This type of inhibition cannot be provided by the usual
mechanisms, that is to say by binding the inhibitor as a struc-
tural analog of the substrate: in some cases these would bring
about an unwanted effect; in others the ultimate product of
a pathway might bear little structural resemblance to any of
the reactants of the regulated enzyme; for example, histidine
bears little similarity to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, its
metabolic precursor.
To permit inhibition or activation by
metabolically appropriate effectors, many regulated enzymes
have evolved sites for effector binding that are separate from
the catalytic sites. Monod and co-workers proposed that they
should be called allosteric sites, from the Greek for different
shape4, to emphasize the structural dissimilarity between
substrate and effector, and enzymes that possess them are
called allosteric enzymes.
J
ACQUES LUCIEN MONOD
(1910–1972) had a dis-
tinguished career in
bacteriology, where he
introduced the chemostat and
developed the Monod equation
for bacterial growth, usually
written as
µ = ˆµ ·
S
Ka + S
which has the same form as the
Michaelis–Menten equation. He
later became one of the found-
ing fathers of molecular biology,
a ﬁeld that in its early days was
not as remote from classical
enzymology as it later became.
In proposing the ﬁrst plausible
explanation of the regulatory
properties of certain enzymes
he stimulated the explosion of
interest in these properties after
1965, the year in which he was
awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine. From
his mother, an American from
Milwaukee, he acquired a
perfect command of English,
both spoken and written, and
his writing was outstandingly
clear and idiomatic. Politically
active throughout his life, he
participated actively in the
Resistance to the Nazi occupa-
tion of France, and was brieﬂy a
member of the French Com-
munist Party, though not for
long, as he quickly found that
his spirit of independent
thought was incompatible with
the discipline expected of its
members.
Many allosteric enzymes are also cooperative, and vice
versa. This is not surprising as both properties are impor-
tant in metabolic regulation, but it does not mean that the
two terms are interchangeable: they describe two different
properties and should be clearly distinguished.
In many
cases, they were recognized separately: the ﬁrst enzyme in
the biosynthetic pathway to histidine was one of the ﬁrst
allosteric enzymes to be known, but it has not been reported
to be cooperative; hemoglobin was known to be cooperative

meaning better.

12.2.1
The Hill equation
It is often convenient to express the degree of cooperativity of
an enzyme in terms of the following equation:
v =
Vah
Kh
0.5 + ah
(12.1)
This is known as the Hill equation, as a similar equation was
ﬁrst proposed by Hill as an empirical description of the co-

effects of the aggregation of the
molecules of hemoglobin on its
dissociation curves” Journal of
Physiology 40, iv–vii
operative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. The parameter
V fulﬁlls the same role as the limiting rate in the Michaelis–
Menten equation, and may be known by the same name.
A
RCHIBALD VIVIAN HILL
(1886–1977) is mainly
known in the context
of cooperativity for the work
with hemoglobin that he did
very early in his career. How-
ever, his main contributions
were in the ﬁeld of muscle
biochemistry, and in 1922 he
received the Nobel Prize for
Physiology or Medicine in
recognition of his discoveries
relating to the product of heat
in muscle.
However, although K0.5, like Km in the Michaelis–Menten
equation, deﬁnes the value of the substrate concentration a at
which v = 0.5V, it should not be called the Michaelis constant
or given the symbol Km, because these refer speciﬁcally to the
Michaelis–Menten equation, and equation 12.1 is not equiv-
alent to the Michaelis–Menten equation (except in the trivial
case of h = 1). The Hill equation6 is often written in a form
resembling the following:
v =
Vh
K + ah
with K0.5 replaced by a constant K that is not raised to the
power h: although this presents no problem for the practical
use of the equation, it has the disadvantage that the resulting
5These experiments illustrate very well the importance of expressing
measured values in appropriate units. The concentration of 2,3-bisphospho-
glycerate in g per 100 ml in human erythrocytes had been accurately known
for 40 years, but it only became obvious that it was approximately equimolar
with hemoglobin when Benesch and Benesch converted the concentrations
to molar. Susan Benesch, the daughter of the discoverers, told me that the
change of units was prompted by a graduate student’s question, probably
“what is the function of the DPG?”, illustrating the importance of asking the
right question at the right time.
6In common with many other workers in the hemoglobin ﬁeld, Hill
expressed his equation in terms of an association constant, in contrast to the
use of dissociation constants that is almost universal in enzyme kinetics. To
avoid confusion, and to maintain consistency with the rest of the book, all
equations in this chapter are written in terms of dissociation constants.

measured, for example, in units M3.2, and it is difﬁcult to give
it a physical meaning.

deriving his equation, makes no

plicitly disavowed any physical meaning for the parameter
h, which is now usually called the Hill coefﬁcient.7 Although
one sometimes sees attempts to derive the equation from a
model (Figure 12.7), it is best to follow his example.

Hill equation, with an integral value of h, can be a limiting

Figure 12.8. Hill conceived
hemoglobin as a mixture of
monomer, dimer, trimer, and so
on, each of which could bind O2
in an all-or-none fashion. He
found he was unable to explain
the data in terms of a mono-
mer–dimer mixture and then
suggested equation 12.1 as an
approximation to the true
equation. This model is now of
historical interest only.
not found experimentally to be an integer, and, except as a
limit with inﬁnitely strong interactions, realistic models do
not predict that it should be. It is incorrect, therefore, to treat
it as an estimate of the number of substrate-binding sites on
the enzyme, though for some models it does provide a lower
limit for this number. In the case of hemoglobin, the number
of oxygen-binding sites is 4 (though this was not known in
Hill’s time), but typical values of h are about 2.7.
If equation 12.1 is rearranged as follows:
v
V −v =
ah
Kh
0.5
then v/(V −v) may be regarded in the absence of direct
binding information as a measure of [EA]/[E], and when
logarithms are taken of both sides:
ln

v
V −v

= h ln a −h ln K0.5
it may be seen that a plot of ln [v/(V −v)] against ln a should
be a straight line with slope h. This plot, which is illustrated in
Figure 12.9, is called a Hill plot, and provides a simple means
of evaluating h and K0.5. It has been found to ﬁt a wide variety
of cooperative kinetic data remarkably well for v/V values
7He wrote “I decided to try whether [an equation equivalent to equa-
tion 12.1] would satisfy the observations. My object was rather to see whether
an equation of this type would satisfy all the observations, than to base any
direct physical meaning on [h] and [K0.5].”
(Italics in the original).
This
clear statement has not discouraged later authors from presenting spurious
“derivations” of equation 12.1, or from supposing h to have a simple physical
meaning, such as the number of substrate-binding sites on each enzyme
molecule.
8Even these cases do not correspond to the sort of models Hill had in
mind: he conceived hemoglobin as a mixture of monomers, dimers, trimers
and so on (Figure 12.8), each of which could exist either with no sites occu-
pied or with all sites occupied.

Michaelis–Menten kinetics are hardly noticeable in these coordinates. The
lines are calculated from the Hill equation (equation 12.1 but with the points
calculated from a realistic binding function. As the Hill equation is at best an
approximation one should always expect the observations to tend towards
unit slope at the extremes, whatever the slope may be in the central region.
However, even in the absence of experimental error the deviations are often
small, and almost undetectable in the part of the curve between 10 and 90%
saturation, shown in the unshaded region in this plot.
in the range 0.1–0.9, though deviations always occur at the
extremes (as indicated in the ﬁgure), because equation 12.1 is
at best only an approximation to a more complex relationship.
These deviations are not very obvious in Figure 12.9, which
shows realistically calculated points. The picture of a Hill plot
that one should have in mind is more as illustrated in Figure
12.10, in which the sigmoid shape of the trend is exaggerated.
The Hill coefﬁcient is widely used as an index of coopera-
tivity, the degree of cooperativity being considered to increase
as h increases. For a noncooperative (Michaelis–Menten) en-
zyme, h = 1, and so positive cooperativity means h greater
than 1. Negative cooperativity, with h less than 1, also occurs
for some enzymes, though it is less common (at least for pure
enzymes), possibly because it is less clear what physiological
role it might fulﬁll.

Speciﬁcity of non-Michaelis–Menten enzymes
As discussed in Section 2.4, the speciﬁcity of an enzyme that

obeys Michaelis–Menten kinetics is deﬁned unambiguously
12.2 The development of models for cooperativity

by the speciﬁcity constant, the ratio kcat/Km, because the ratio
of rates vA/vB given by two substrates A and B at concentra-
tions a and b is given by the following equation (shown in a
more detailed version as equation 2.189):

that does not obey Michaelis–Menten kinetics, however, be-
cause the parameter Km does not exist for such an enzyme.
It is tempting simply to replace Km by K0.5, as done, for
example, in a study of hexokinase D by Cárdenas and co-
workers.
Analysis of speciﬁcity in terms of model-based equations
for cooperativity that will be discussed later in this chapter
is much too complicated to be practical. Within the range of
validity of the Hill equation, however, an argument parallel
with that in Section 2.4 was used by Cornish-Bowden and
Cárdenas to arrive at the following equation, in which hA and
hB are the Hill coefﬁcients for A and B.

Thus kcat/Kh
0.5 is the appropriate measure of speciﬁcity for an
enzyme that does not obey Michaelis–Menten kinetics. This
is not ideal, because its units include nonintegral powers of
K0.5 and vary with the strength of the cooperativity. However,
this should not create a problem in practice as long as K0.5 is
measured in the same units as the substrate concentration, as
normally it will be.
Cornish-Bowden and Cárdenas discuss the application of
this analysis to hexokinase D, an enzyme for which the differ-
ent sugar substrates display differing degrees of cooperativ-
ity.

having a more obvious experimental meaning and of always
being treated as purely empirical, not being confused by at-
tempts to relate it to models of dubious validity. It is deﬁned
as the ratio of a values that give v/V = 0.9 and v/V = 0.1.
The relationship between Ra and h can be found by substitut-
ing these two values of v/V successively into equation 12.1:
0.9 =
ah
0.9
Kh

and solving for the two values of a:
a0.9 = 91/hK0.5; a0.1 = K0.5/91/h
Then Ra is easily obtained as a0.9/a0.1:
Ra = 811/h
(12.2)
It follows that Ra = 81 characterizes a noncooperative en-
zyme; cooperative enzymes have values less than 81; nega-

2 Very rare for single

3 Beyond the range for
single enzymes (see the text)
tively cooperative enzymes have values greater than 81. This
relationship is only as accurate as equation 12.1, of course,
but that is adequate for most purposes. Some representative
values are listed in Table 12.1.
The values labeled as “ex-
treme” in the table, for h > 8 (Ra < 1.7) are never found for
catalysis by a single enzyme, and those in the range 4 > h > 8
(1.7 < Ra < 3) are exceptional. They are included for two
reasons, however.
First, the degree of cooperativity at the
limit of what can be achieved with a single enzyme is far
from ideal: normally we expect a switching device to span
more than the 10–90% range of full activity, and we expect
it to respond to changes of less than three-fold in conditions.
Second, although individual enzymes cannot achieve the ex-
treme values, combinations of enzymes acting in concert can
do so, as will be discussed in Section 13.9.2.
§13.9.2, pages 365–366
12.2.4
Assumption of equilibrium binding in
cooperative kinetics
In discussing noncooperative kinetics I have emphasized
(Section 2.7.1) that one cannot assume that substrate binding
§2.7.1, pages 54–61
is at equilibrium, so one cannot assume that the Michaelis
constant Km is the same as the thermodynamic substrate
dissociation constant. In principle the arguments apply with
almost equal force to enzymes that display deviations from
Michaelis–Menten kinetics.
The only mitigating feature is
12.2 The development of models for cooperativity
291
that for cooperative enzymes one can postulate that arriving
at very high catalytic activity has been less important during
evolution than arriving at useful regulatory behavior. In any
case, it is virtually impossible to obtain usable rate equations
for cooperative systems unless some simplifying assumptions
are made, and the one that is made almost always is that
binding is at equilibrium.
Normally the only time such an assumption is not made
is in deriving models in which the cooperativity is wholly
kinetic in origin (Section 12.9). In the rest of this chapter I shall
§12.9, pages 320–323
assume equilibrium binding when discussing the kinetics of
oligomeric enzymes.
12.2.5
The Adair equation
Suppose that an enzyme has two active sites that bind sub-
strate independently and at equilibrium, with dissociation
constants Ks1 and Ks2, as shown in Figure 12.11. If the same
chemical reaction takes place independently at the two sites
with rate constants k1 and k2, then each site will indepen-
dently obey Michaelis–Menten kinetics with a Michaelis con-
stant equal to the appropriate dissociation constant and the
total rate will be the sum of the rates for the two sites:

(12.3)
The limiting rate is the sum of the limiting rates of the two
sites, that is to say V = k1e0 + k2e0. If we assume for simplicity
that the catalytic rate constants are equal, so that we can write
k1e0 = k2e0 = V/2, then equation 12.3 may be written as
follows:
v
V/2 =
a
Ks1 + a +

(12.4)
This corresponds to the analysis of proton dissociation in
terms of group dissociation constants10 (Section 10.3.1), which
§10.3.1, pages 257–258
are better called intrinsic dissociation constants in the context
of ligand binding to proteins. Exactly the same model can
be expressed in terms of molecular dissociation constants (as in
Section 10.3.2): 11
§10.3.2, pages 259–260
10Like the Hill equation, the Adair equation was originally expressed in
terms of association constants, but is here redrafted in terms of dissociation
constants.

Here K1 expresses the binding of the ﬁrst molecule of sub-

[EA], K2 = [EA][A]/2[EA2]. The relationship of these con-
stants to the intrinsic dissociation constants is taken up in
equations 12.7, below. Equation 12.5 is known as the Adair
equation, as Adair expressed the binding of oxygen to hemo-

As well as being written for four sites, this equation has v/V
replaced by y, a quantity known as the fractional saturation, the
fraction of the total number of binding sites that are occupied
by ligand. This is because in a true binding experiment there
is no rate and hence no limiting rate.
However, as it is
difﬁcult to measure binding directly with sufﬁcient accuracy,
it is not uncommon to measure other quantities, such as rates
or spectroscopic signals, and to interpret them as measures
of binding.
In the case of rates, I have already discussed
in the previous section the question of whether binding can
be assumed to be at equilibrium in the steady state, and
will not labor the point here. There is, however, a second

complication about regarding v/V as a measure of y, which is
that it depends on assuming that each active site has the same
catalytic constant: we made this assumption in going from
equation 12.3 to equation 12.4, but there is no reason to expect
it to be true in general, and it becomes progressively more
implausible as one moves to models with greater numbers of
sites and greater differences between their binding constants.
The same complication applies to interpretation of a spectro-
scopic signal as a measure of binding.
11Equation 12.5 is more general than the model in Figure 12.11 from which
it was derived. It allows a limiting value of h →2, if K1 is sufﬁciently large
for the terms a/K1 to be negligible in comparison with a2/K1K2, but the
assumption of independent sites in Figure 12.11 does not allow h > 1. We
shall see why this should be so at the end of this section.
12.2 The development of models for cooperativity
293
Equation 12.6, the equation for four sites, illustrates rather
better than equation 12.5 the general form of the Adair equa-
tion for an arbitrary number n of sites, as it shows more
clearly that the numerical coefﬁcients in both numerator (1,
3, 3, 1) and denominator (1, 4, 6, 4, 1) are the binomial
coefﬁcients (Figure 12.12) for n  1 and n respectively: the
numerator coefﬁcients are )n  1*!/i!)n  1  i*! for i = 0 to
n  1, and the denominator coefﬁcients are n!/i!)n  i*! for
i = 0 to n. In general the Adair equation can be written as
follows:

However, although this type of expression may be found in
highly theoretical discussions of cooperativity it is usually
regarded as excessively abstract for more experimental con-
texts.
For educational purposes it is often more effective
to sacriﬁce generality for the sake of simplicity, and in this
chapter I shall normally write equations that assume partic-
ular numbers of binding sites rather than aim for complete
generality.
The coefﬁcients in the Adair equation are often regarded
as statistical factors. Thus, there are four ways of binding one
substrate molecule to an enzyme molecule with four vacant
sites (Figure 12.13), but only one way of removing the single
substrate molecule from a complex with one molecule bound
(Figure 12.14): this produces the factor 4
1 (that is to say 4) in
the denominator. There three ways of proceeding to the next
step (Figure 12.15), but two ways of doing it in the reverse
direction (Figure 12.16), so the 4 is multiplied by 3
2 to give 6,
and so on.
The particular way of writing the Adair equation used
here, in both equations 12.5 and 12.6, is chosen to give molec-
ular dissociation constants that are equal if all of the sites are
identical and do not interact,12 a very useful property if one
wants to quantify the degree of departure from this simple
assumption. Various other ways of writing the Adair equa-
tion may be found in the literature, with different numerical
coefﬁcients (so that the dissociation constants are no longer

equal to one another in the simplest case), or with association
instead of dissociation constants, or with products of asso-
ciation constants written with special symbols, for example.
The use of association constants is particularly common in
the hemoglobin literature and in other papers with a binding
rather than a kinetic emphasis.
Returning now for simplicity to the two-site case, the
relationship between the molecular dissociation constants of
equation 12.5 and the two intrinsic dissociation constants of
equation 12.4 follows from a comparison of equation 12.5 with
a multiplied-out version of equation 12.4:

It is obvious from the ordinary idea of a mean that K1 =
K2 = Ks1 = Ks2 if Ks1 = Ks2. More interesting is the relation-
ship between them when the intrinsic dissociation constants
are different. This can be examined by considering the ratio
K2/K1 deﬁned by equation 12.7:

As this contains three terms, of which the second and third
move in opposite directions when the ratio Ks2/Ks1 varies,
one might think at ﬁrst sight that the value could be either
greater than or less than 1 for different values of this ratio. In
fact it is simpler than that, because (Ks2/Ks1) + (Ks1/Ks2) ≥2
for any two positive numbers Ks1 and Ks2, and consequently
the sum deﬁned by equation 12.8 cannot be less than 1, or
K1 ≤K2

(arithmetic) mean of their reciprocals. For example, the arithmetic mean of

12.2 The development of models for cooperativity
295
as illustrated in Figure 12.17, Observationally, this means that
the second molecule will always bind more weakly than the
ﬁrst, exactly, of course, as we expect from everyday experi-
ence with large objects: it is easier to detach something that is
weakly attached than something that is tightly attached.
The implications of equation 12.9 for cooperativity are not
easy to derive algebraically, even if one uses the cooperativity
index of Taketa and Pogell (Section 12.2.3), because solving
§12.2.3, pages 289–290
equation 12.5 for a after setting v/V to 0.1 or 0.9 leads to
expressions whose meanings are not transparent. However,
it is easy to show numerically, by calculating curves with var-
ious different values of K2/K1, that as long as equation 12.9
is obeyed the result is always negative cooperativity, that is
to say Ra > 81 or h < 1 (compare equation 12.2). In con-
clusion, therefore, the hypothesis embodied in Figure 12.11 is
incapable of explaining positive cooperativity. The problem
is not with the assumption of binding at two sites, which is
reasonable enough, but with the assumption that this binding
is independent, that is to say that neither binding process has
any inﬂuence on the other. Putting this the other way around,
we can say that whenever we observe positive cooperativity
we can be sure that the binding at different sites is not inde-
pendent. (Negative cooperativity can also imply interactions
between the sites, but, unlike positive cooperativity, it does
not have to imply this).
We have been assuming nonidentical noninteracting bind-
ing sites on the same protein molecule, but this assumption is
not necessary: essentially the same analysis applies to a mix-
ture of two nonidentical noninteracting proteins that are both
capable of binding A. The same conclusion applies, therefore:
a mixture of different proteins can generate deviations from
Ra = 81 or h = 1, but only in the direction of negative
cooperativity.
If either of the proteins is itself cooperative
when considered in isolation the mixing can cause a decrease
in the observed cooperativity, but not an increase.
12.2.6
Mechanistic and operational deﬁnitions of
cooperativity
The Adair equation, equation 12.5, is more general than the
model from which we derived it, as it can still deﬁne the
behavior even if equation 12.9 is not obeyed. In practice, in
fact, it is used more often to describe positive than negative
cooperativity. It allows a mechanistic deﬁnition of cooperativ-
ity that may be compared with the purely empirical deﬁni-
296

tion in terms of Ra (Section 12.2.3) or the pseudo-mechanistic
deﬁnition in terms of h (Section 12.2.1). The three deﬁnitions

Jr. (1970) “Positive and negative
cooperativity in yeast glycer-
aldehyde 3-phosphate dehydro-
genase” Biochemistry 9,
3337–3342
are qualitatively equivalent, at least if we restrict attention
to two-site enzymes: if we deﬁne positive cooperativity as
meaning that K2 < K1, then this also means that Ra < 81
and that h > 1. It becomes more complicated when there
are more than two sites, as it is quite possible with equations
such as equation 12.6 to have relationships such as K1 >
K2 ≈K3 < K4, as observed by Cook and Koshland for
the binding of oxidized NAD to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase from yeast. Mechanistically this is clearly a
mixture of positive and negative cooperativity, but such a
mixture cannot be expressed by Ra, as it is a single number
that has to be either greater than or less than 81, and cannot
be both.
This is rather unsatisfactory, and one may ask if any opera-
tional deﬁnition of cooperativity is possible that takes account
of the complexity of nature. Whitehead pointed out that the

and steady-state kinetic data”

Koshland, Jr. (1975) “Diagnostic
uses of Hill (logit and Nernst)
plots” Journal of Molecular
Biology 95, 202–212
Hill coefﬁcient provides just such a deﬁnition. Consider the
quantity Q = a(1 −y)/y: this is a constant equal to the
dissociation constant if there is only one binding site, or if
there are n identical independent sites (that is to say if the
Adair constants satisfy the relationship K1 = K2 = · · · = Kn).
If, however, Q decreases as a increases, so dQ/da is nega-
tive, then it is clear that the binding is getting progressively
stronger as more ligand binds: it is then reasonable to say
that the system is positively cooperative at the particular
value of a at which a negative value of dQ/da has been ob-
served. Noncooperative and negatively cooperative systems
can be deﬁned similarly. For any binding function, the sign
of dQ/da is opposite to that of (h −1): dQ/da is negative,
zero or positive according to whether h is greater than, equal
to, or less than 1; consequently a deﬁnition of cooperativity in
terms of the Hill coefﬁcient is exactly equivalent to the more
rational deﬁnition proposed by Whitehead. This conclusion
is entirely independent of any consideration of whether the
Hill equation has any physical or descriptive validity.
The deﬁnition of cooperativity in terms of the Hill coefﬁ-
cient is not necessarily equivalent to a deﬁnition in terms of
Adair constants if there are more than two sites, and it re-
mains therefore to consider what is the relationship between
the two. Cornish-Bowden and Koshland explored this ques-
tion at a simple descriptive level, and found that there is a fair
but not exact correspondence between them. As an example,
consider the data shown in Figure 12.18. The curve has a slope

greater than 1 at low ligand concentrations, is equal to 1 close
to half-saturation, and is less than 1 at high ligand concentra-
tions, in agreement with the relationship K1 ? K2  K3 = K4
mentioned at the beginning of this section, which was found
by ﬁtting the data to equation 12.6, the Adair equation for four
sites. Examination of many calculated Hill plots showed that
this sort of correspondence applied in most cases. To sum-
marize, although deﬁnitions of cooperativity based on the
Hill plot and the Adair equation are not exactly equivalent,
they are qualitatively similar and no great harm comes from
continuing to use both as appropriate: the deﬁnition in terms
of the Hill plot applies more generally, but the deﬁnition in
terms of the Adair equation has greater physical meaning in
the circumstances where it can be used.
Unfortunately there is no easy way of converting a set
of Adair constants to the parameters of the Hill equation
that best approximate the same curve. Not only is there no
exact correspondence between the measures of cooperativity,
as just discussed, but one cannot readily calculate even the
half-saturation concentration (K0.5 in equation 12.1) except
in certain special cases; the best one can usually say is that
it will be within the range of the Adair constants (smaller
than the largest and larger than the smallest). This is espe-
cially unfortunate when one considers that the half-saturation
concentration, like the Hill coefﬁcient itself, is an important
experimental parameter that is very useful for comparing one
curve with another.

Analysis of binding experiments
12.3.1
Equilibrium dialysis
As noted already, the equation for binding a ligand to a
protein molecule has the same form as the Michaelis–Menten
equation, and the equation for binding to several noninter-
acting sites is of the same form as the kinetic equation for
a mixture of enzymes that catalyze the same reaction.

molecules bound to them)
cannot cross the membrane.
principle, the kinetic case differs in that the limiting rate is un-
known and must be treated as an experimental quantity to be
measured, whereas in binding experiments it is known at the
outset that saturation means one molecule of ligand bound
per site. This difference is more theoretical than real, however,
because the protein molarity may not be known accurately
enough for the exact limit to be predicted, and the number
of binding sites per molecule may not be known either (and
298
12. Regulation of Enzyme Activity
is sometimes, indeed, the principal piece of information that
binding experiments are intended to provide).
In practice, therefore, binding is often measured by equi-
librium dialysis, by setting up an equilibrium across a mem-
brane that is permeable to ligand but not to protein, and mea-
suring the concentrations of ligand on the two sides. The free
concentration afree is assumed to be the same on both sides,
and is measured directly on the side without the protein, so
the concentration abound of ligand bound to the protein can
be obtained by subtracting the known value of afree from
the total on that side. Before proceeding further, we must
note an important experimental characteristic of equilibrium
dialysis. In an ordinary steady-state kinetic experiment it is
the kinetic activity of the enzyme that is measured, and as
long as the speciﬁc activity is high the molarity of the enzyme
can be small without preventing us from making accurate
measurements. By contrast, in equilibrium dialysis, the mea-
sured quantity, abound, can never exceed the total molarity of
binding sites, and is obtained, moreover, by subtraction; it
is important, therefore, to ensure that the protein and ligand
concentrations are similar in magnitude. As this means that
equilibrium dialysis and steady-state kinetic experiments are
done in very different ranges of protein concentration, they
may sometimes give apparently inconsistent results, for ex-
ample if the enzyme associates at high concentrations.

If there is just one site, abound is the fractional saturation
y multiplied by the protein concentration. However, we shall
not assume that the number of sites is known, but will treat
abound as the observed quantity whose dependence on afree is
to be determined:
abound = ne0afree

In this equation n is the number of binding sites, all of which
are assumed to bind with the same intrinsic dissociation con-

This shows that if equation 12.10 is obeyed the plot should
show a straight line with slope 1/K and intercepts ne0/K on
the ordinate and ne0 on the abscissa, as illustrated in Figure
12.20. Comparison with the plots in Section 2.6 shows that
it corresponds to the plot of v against v/a (Section 2.6.4)
with the axes reversed. Curiously, the same biochemists who
never think of using anything but a double-reciprocal plot to
analyze kinetic data never use anything but a Scatchard plot
for analyzing binding data. The binding equivalent of the
double-reciprocal plot, sometimes known as a Klotz plot, was
proposed earlier by Klotz and co-workers on the basis of a
different rearrangement of equation 12.10:

It is now quite rare, and I am not aware of any examples of
use of the binding equivalent of the plot of a/v against a. This
practice has nothing to do with the respective merits of the
different plots, or different needs of kinetic and binding data,
but is just a matter of fashion. Despite the occasional appear-
ance of Klotz plots in the modern literature (for example in
a study of ovalbumin by Lu and co-workers) it is probably
reasonable to regard it as obsolete.14
In the Scatchard plot neither of the plotted variables is a
true independent variable; both are calculated by transform-
ing the actual observations.
This has an important conse-
quence for the appearance of the plot (and for methods of data
analysis that assume that error is conﬁned to one variable: see
Chapter 15), one that makes it easy to recognize a particular
class of mistake that can be made in constructing a Scatchard
plot (for example by M. Wang and co-workers).

different, because both coordinates are affected by a change
in the value of afree: not only are the two ordinate values dif-
ferent, (atotal −afree,1)/afree,1 and (atotal −afree,2)/afree,2, but
the two abscissa values are also different atotal −afree,1 and
atotal −afree,2. In fact the displacement is along a line through
the origin (Figure 12.22), not parallel with either axis. The cor-
rect behavior may be seen in a recent study by Rathanaswami
and co-workers. It is correspondingly difﬁcult, and for prac-
tical purposes impossible, to choose any particular series of
abscissa values to be plotted; one must take the values as
they appear. It follows, therefore, that if one sees a plot in
which replicate points are displaced vertically (Figure 12.23),
or where two or more experiments in different conditions lead
to the same series of abscissa values, or where the abscissa
values are regularly spaced, it is virtually certain that the plot
has been drawn incorrectly and that conclusions based on it
cannot be trusted. A recent example may be seen in a paper by
M. Wang and co-workers. The problem illustrated in Figure

As the Scatchard plot is frequently used for analyzing data
more complicated than can be expressed by equation 12.10 it
also is important to understand its properties when there are
multiple nonequivalent binding sites. The question is now
whether any simple graphical method exists that permits the
ready estimation of the parameters. The correct answer to this
question is no, but this is not the answer that most people who
carry out binding experiments would give. For any supposed
values of the parameters it is simple to calculate the expected
shape of the line in a Scatchard plot, because, as Rosenthal
pointed out, the components are additive along lines through
the origin, as illustrated in Figure 12.24, and an example of
a valid application of Rosenthal’s analysis can be found in a
recent paper by C. Wang and Croll. What one must not do is
to ignore the manifest curvature and treat the points as if they
fall on a straight line, as done, for example, in a recent study
by Sheoran and co-workers. The simplest case to consider
is a protein with two classes of sites, n1 sites with intrinsic
dissociation constant Ks1 and n2 sites with Ks2. The binding
equivalent of equation 12.4 is then as follows:

consequence the parameters estimated from Scatchard plots
rarely agree, even approximately, with the data from which
they are derived, because they are determined by the invalid
method illustrated in Figure 12.25, in which the curve is
treated as a pair of straight lines.

For noninteracting nonequivalent sites the curvature is
always in the direction shown,15 though the quantitative de-
tails vary.
The most important point to notice is that the
two straight lines, which represent the plots that would be
obtained if only one of the two classes of sites were present,
lie far from the curve at all points (compare the Michaelis–
Menten hyperbola shown in Figure 2.3 and the discussion in
Section 2.3.4). This means that one cannot hope to estimate
§2.3.4, pages 35–37
either of these straight lines (and hence one cannot hope to
estimate either pair of parameters) by drawing straight lines
through some of the points, as done, for example, by Labonté
and co-workers, and the error that results from doing this may
be large: for example, in Figure 12.25 naive extrapolation of
the part of the curve at low abound would suggest about 1.5
sites of high afﬁnity rather than one. In general, there is only
one binding parameter of interest that can be deduced in a
simple way from a Scatchard plot, namely the total number of
binding sites, the extrapolated intersection of the curve with
the abound axis.
It is, in fact, quite easy to judge by eye whether the points
on a Scatchard plot agree with the straight lines drawn to
represent the separate classes of site, because the curve can be
obtained by adding the values from them along lines through
the origin. The relevant addition is illustrated in Figure 12.24
for an arbitrary point along the curve. The calculation applies
even if there are more than two classes of site, so one can
draw straight lines for any number of classes, and the ﬁnal
curve is the sum, along lines through the origin, of all the
contributions.

I have considered noninteracting nonequivalent sites in
some detail because the Scatchard plot is often used for them.
Negative cooperativity produces similar curves, and hence
cannot be distinguished from noninteracting nonequivalent
sites by inspection of the plot (Figure 12.26), but positive co-
operativity produces curvature in the opposite direction with,
in extreme cases, a maximum in the value of abound/afree, as
illustrated schematically in Figure 12.27.

Early theories of hemoglobin cooperativity assumed that the
oxygen-binding sites on each molecule would have to be close
enough together to interact electronically. Pauling made this

assumption explicitly, but it was already implied in Hill’s
and Adair’s ideas. Indeed, as long as the binding sites are
close together there is no special mechanistic problem to be
overcome for explaining cooperativity: no one, for example,
feels any need for conformational changes or other exotic
mechanisms to explain why the quinone molecule readily
binds either zero or two hydrogen atoms but not one, or in
other words to explain why the binding of hydrogen atoms to
quinone has a Hill coefﬁcient of 2.
However, when Perutz and co-workers determined the
three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin the heme groups
proved to be 2.5–4.0 nm apart, too far to interact in any of
the ways that had been envisaged. Nonetheless, long-range
interactions occur in all positively cooperative proteins, and
probably in most others as well, and all modern theories
account for these in terms of protein ﬂexibility. As early as
1951 Wyman and Allen had suggested that conformational
changes could account for long-range effects in hemoglobin.
Their ideas later reemerged in the symmetry model of coop-

erativity discussed in Section 12.5, but the major stimulus
§12.5, pages 304–312
to interest in conformational effects came with Koshland’s
theory of induced ﬁt, and the purpose of this section is to
examine the experimental and theoretical basis of this theory.
The high degree of speciﬁcity that enzymes display to-
wards their substrates has impressed biochemists since the
earliest studies of enzymes, long before anything was known
about their physical and chemical structures.
Fischer was
particularly impressed by the ability of living organisms to
discriminate totally between sugars that differed only slightly
and at atoms remote from the sites of reaction. To explain
this ability, he proposed that the active site of an enzyme
was a negative imprint of its substrate(s), and that it would
catalyze the reactions only of compounds that ﬁtted precisely,
as illustrated in Figure 12.28. This is similar to the mode of
an ordinary key in a lock, and the theory is known as Fis-
cher’s lock-and-key model of enzyme action. For many years, it
seemed to explain all of the known facts of enzyme speciﬁcity,
but as more detailed research was done there were more and
12.4 Induced ﬁt
303
more observations that were difﬁcult to account for in terms
of a rigid active site of the type that Fischer had envisaged.
For example, the occurrence of enzymes for two-substrate re-
actions that require the substrates to bind in the correct order
provides one kind of evidence, as mentioned in Section 8.2.1.

of water to react in several enzyme-catalyzed reactions where
the lock-and-key model would predict reaction. Consider, for
example, the reaction catalyzed by hexokinase:
✲
glucose + MgATP
glucose 6-phosphate + MgADP
The enzyme from yeast is not particularly speciﬁc for its sugar
substrates: it will accept not only glucose but other sugars,
such as fructose and mannose. It does not catalyze ATP hy-
drolysis, however, because water does not react, even though
it can scarcely fail to saturate the active site of the enzyme,
at a concentration of 56 M, about 7 × 106 times the Michaelis
constant for glucose, and chemically it is at least as reactive as
the sugars that do react.
H
ERMANN EMIL FISCHER
(1852–1919) was con-
sidered by his father
as too stupid to be a business-
man and better suited to being a
student, but he became the
greatest chemist of his age. In
addition to his lock-and-key
model of enzyme speciﬁcity, he
made major contributions to
organic chemistry, including
work on carbohydrates (espe-
cially their stereochemistry),
purines, amino acids (he was
the discoverer of valine and
proline), proteins and triacyl-
glycerols. In 1902 he became the
second winner of the Nobel
Prize for Chemistry, “in recog-
nition of his synthetic work in
the sugar and purine groups”.
He was in poor health at the
end of his life, caused in part by
toxic effects of the heavy use of
phenylhydrazine in his synthe-
tic work, and after losing two of
his sons in the First World War
he committed suicide in 1919.
Koshland argued that these and other observations pro-
vided strong evidence for a ﬂexible active site; he proposed
that the active site of an enzyme has the potential to ﬁt the
substrate precisely, but that it does not adopt the conforma-
tion that matches the substrate until the substrate binds (Fig-
ure 12.29).
This conformational adjustment accompanying
substrate binding brings about the proper alignment of the
catalytic groups of the enzyme with the site of reaction in
the substrate.
With this hypothesis the properties of yeast
hexokinase can easily be explained: water can certainly bind
to the active site of the enzyme, but it lacks the bulk to force
the conformational change needed for catalysis.
Koshland’s theory is known as the induced-ﬁt hypothesis,
to emphasize its differences from Fischer’s theory, which as-
sumes that the ﬁt between enzyme and substrate preexists
and does not need to be induced.
The lock-and-key anal-
ogy can be pursued a little further by likening Koshland’s
conception to a Yale lock, in which the key can ﬁt only by
realigning the tumblers, and in doing so it allows the lock to
open. However, a better analogy is perhaps provided by an
ordinary glove, with the potential of ﬁtting a hand exactly,
but ﬁtting it in reality only when the hand is inserted. This
analogy has the additional merit of illustrating the essential
stereochemical character of enzyme structure: even though a
left glove and a right glove may look similar, a left glove
304

does not ﬁt a right hand.
The induced-ﬁt theory has had
important consequences in several branches of enzymology
(see Section 8.2.1, for example), but it was especially impor-
§8.2.1, pages 190–193
tant for understanding the allosteric and cooperative prop-
erties of proteins, because it provided a simple and plausi-
ble explanation of long-range interactions. Provided that a
protein combines rigidity with ﬂexibility in a controlled and
purposive way, like a pair of scissors, a substrate-induced
conformational change at one point in the molecule may be
communicated over several nanometers to any other point.
12.4.2
Induced ﬁt today
Now that the three-dimensional structures of many enzymes
are known, not only in crystals but in solution in differ-
ent states of the catalytic process, it has become clear that
conformational changes induced by substrate binding are as
general a phenomenon as Koshland envisaged. In enzyme
mechanisms they range from changes so slight that they are
barely observable to changes as large that induced by binding
of glucose to hexokinase D, an enzyme discussed at the end
of this chapter (Section 12.9) in the context of cooperativity in
monomeric enzymes. This is illustrated in Figure 12.30.

Even larger changes in conformation are found in intrin-
sically unstructured proteins. These are not enzymes, but are
small proteins that only acquire a deﬁnite three-dimensional
structure when bound to other proteins; otherwise they ran-
dom coils. For example, CP12 is a 9 kDa protein that mod-

ulates the activity of the Calvin cycle in photosynthetic or-
ganisms by acting as a scaffold element in the formation of
a supramolecular complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

workers have shown, it is “chaperone-like”, which means that
when bound to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
it protects the enzyme from aggregation and loss of activity.

Basic postulates of the symmetry model
Cooperative interactions in hemoglobin are not unique in
requiring interactions between sites that are widely separated
in space; the same is true of other cooperative proteins, and
of allosteric effects in many enzymes.
A striking example
12.5 The model of Monod, Wyman and Changeux
305
is provided by the allosteric inhibition of phosphoribosyl-
ATP pyrophosphorylase by histidine: Martin found that mild
treatment of this enzyme by Hg2+ ions destroyed the sensi-
tivity of the catalytic activity to histidine, but affected neither
the uninhibited activity nor the binding of histidine. In other
words, the metal ion interfered with neither the catalytic site
nor the allosteric site, but with the connection between them.
Monod, Changeux and Jacob studied many examples of co-

operative and allosteric phenomena, and concluded that they
were closely related and that conformational ﬂexibility proba-
bly accounted for both. Subsequently, Monod and co-workers
proposed a general model to explain both phenomena within
a simple set of postulates. It has sometimes been called the
allosteric model, but the term symmetry model emphasizes the
principal difference between it and alternative models, and
avoids the contentious association between allosteric and co-
operative effects.
The symmetry model starts from the observation that each
molecule of a typical cooperative protein contains several
subunits. Indeed, this must be so for binding cooperativity
at equilibrium, though it is not required in kinetic coopera-
tivity (Section 12.9). The symmetry model for four subunits
is shown in Figure 12.31, but for simplicity I shall analyze
the symmetry model in terms of a protein with two subunits
(n = 2), mentioning results for an unspeciﬁed number of
subunits wherever those for n = 2 fail to express the general
case adequately. Any number of subunits greater than one is
possible, and any other kind of ligand (inhibitor or activator)
can be considered instead of a substrate.

Figure 12.32. The symmetry
model of Monod, Wyman and
Changeux, illustrated here for a
protein with two binding sites.
The symmetry model is based on the following postulates:
1. Each subunit can exist in two different conformations,
R and T. These designations, nowadays regarded just as
labels, originally stood for relaxed and tense, because the
protein needs to relax to bind substrate, breaking some
of the interactions that maintain its native structure in
order to make new ones with the substrate.
2. All subunits of a molecule must be in the same con-
formation at any time; hence, for a dimeric protein,
the conformational states R2 and T2 are the only ones
permitted, the mixed conformation RT being forbidden.
This condition is much more restrictive for more than
two subunits. For example, for n = 4 the allowed states
are R4 and T4, and R3T, R2T2 and RT3 are all forbidden.

3. The two states of the protein are in equilibrium, with an
equilibrium constant L = [T2]/[R2].
4. A ligand can bind to a subunit in either conformation,
but the intrinsic dissociation constants16 are different:
KR =[R][A]/[RA] for each R subunit, KT = [T][A]/[TA]
for each T subunit. The ratio KR/KT is sometimes writ-
ten as c, but here we shall use the more explicit form.

was the third of the same
name: his grandfather was
a distinguished anatomist,
and his father was an ofﬁcer in
the Bell Telephone Company.
During his long career he made
many contributions to protein
chemistry, especially in relation
to thermodynamics, and is par-
ticularly associated with the
idea of linkage between different
ligands that bind to the same
protein—speciﬁcally to hemo-
globin. He had met Jacques
Monod while working in Paris
between 1952 and 1955, and his
famous paper with him and
Changeux grew out of ideas
that he had had much earlier.
He spent much of his working
life in Europe, in Cambridge,
Paris, and especially Rome,
where he remained for 25 years
as a “temporary” guest scient-
ist. He was active in a number
of administrative roles, most
particularly the establishment
of the European Molecular
Biology Organization (EMBO).
These postulates imply the set of equilibria between the var-
ious states shown in Figure 12.32, and the concentrations
of the six forms of the protein are related by the following
expressions:

are two vacant sites in each R2 molecule and one occupied site
in each R2A molecule. The fractional saturation y is deﬁned
as before (Section 12.2.5) as the fraction of sites occupied by
ligand, and takes the following form:
y =
[R2A] + 2[R2A2] + [T2A] + 2[T2A2]

try model have always been expressed in terms of dissociation constants, as
they are here. However, Monod, Wyman and Changeux used the symbols R
and T differently from the way they are used here: R represented not a single
subunit but the complete oligomer Rn in general or R2 for the dimer, and
R2, for example, represented an oligomer with two ligand molecules bound,
symbolized here as R2A2. T was used similarly.

contains, whether occupied or not, and so each concentration
is multiplied by the same factor 2. Substituting the concentra-

This is much less complicated than it looks, because it can be
written just as
y =

KRT + [A], with KRT =
1 + L

KR

KT
Despite the complicated expression for this dissociation con-
stant, however, it is still a constant, and so the equation just
deﬁnes a noncooperative binding function. In other words no
cooperativity is possible if n = 1.
Special case 2. If L = 0, the T form of the protein does not
exist under any conditions, and the factor (1 + [A]/KR)n−1
cancels between the numerator and denominator, leaving
y =
[A]
KR + [A]
This again predicts hyperbolic (noncooperative) binding.
Special case 3. A similar simpliﬁcation occurs if L ap-
proaches inﬁnity, and then the R form does not exist: in this
case,
y =
[A]
KT + [A]
Special case 4. It follows from the ﬁrst three examples
that both R and T forms are needed if cooperativity is to
be possible. Moreover, the two forms must be functionally
different from one another, so that KR ̸= KT. If KR = KT it is
again possible to cancel the common factor (1 + [A]/KR)n−1,
leaving a hyperbolic expression. This illustrates the reason-
able expectation that if the ligand binds equally well to the
two states of the protein, the relative proportions in which
they exist are irrelevant to the binding behavior.
General case.
Apart from these special cases, equa-
tion 12.17 predicts positive cooperativity, as may be seen
by multiplying out the factors (1 + [A]/KR)n−1 and (1 +
[A]/KT)n−1, and rearranging the result into the form of the
Adair equation. For n sites the result is complicated, but the
case for the dimer is adequately illustrative. Equation 12.16

As the outer terms in the multiplied-out numerator and de-

middle terms, and as 2xy is less than x2 , y2 for any values
of x and y it follows that K1  K2, so the model predicts pos-
itive cooperativity in terms of the Adair equation.17 Similar
relationships apply between all pairs of Adair constants in
the general case of unspeciﬁed n, and so the model predicts
positive cooperativity at all stages in the binding process.
As this conclusion is algebraic rather than intuitive, it is
helpful to examine one last special case, in which KT is inﬁnite

(1 + [A]/KR) would cancel. When [A] is sufﬁciently large L
becomes negligible compared with the rest of the denomina-
tor, and the curve approaches a hyperbola. But when [A] is
small L dominates the denominator and causes y to remain
initially very small as [A] increases from zero. In other words,
as long as L is signiﬁcantly different from zero the curve of y
against [A] must be sigmoid.
When KR ̸= KT, the degree of cooperativity, and hence
the steepness of the curve, does not increase indeﬁnitely as L
increases, but passes through a maximum when L2 = K2

R.
When this relationship is obeyed the half-saturation concen-
tration (K0.5 in equation 12.1) takes the simple form K0.5 =
(KRKT)0.5. However, as one may see from the representative
binding curves calculated from equation 12.16 shown in Fig-
ure 12.34, this is in general an unreliable estimate; the best one
can say in general is that the half-saturation concentration is
between KR and KT. The ﬁgure was drawn with a logarithmic
concentration scale. If it is redrawn with a linear scale (Figure
12.35) the differences between the different L values are much
less obvious.

Heterotropic effects
Monod and co-workers distinguished between homotropic ef-
fects, or interactions between identical ligands, and hetero-
tropic effects, or interactions between different ligands, such as
a substrate and an allosteric effector. Although the symmetry
model requires homotropic effects to be positively cooper-
ative, it places no corresponding restriction on heterotropic
effects, and it can accommodate these with no extra compli-
cations; this is, indeed, one of its most satisfying features. If
a second ligand B binds preferentially to the R state of the
protein, the state preferred by A, at a different site from A
(so that there is no competition between them), it facilitates
binding of A by increasing the availability of molecules in
the R state; it thus acts as a positive heterotropic effector, or
allosteric activator. On the other hand, a ligand C that binds
preferentially to the T state, which binds A weakly or not at
all, has the opposite effect: it hinders the binding of A by
decreasing the availability of molecules in the R state, and
12.5 The model of Monod, Wyman and Changeux
311
will thus act as a negative heterotropic effector, or allosteric
inhibitor. If all binding is exclusive, which means that each
ligand binds either to the R state or to the T state, but not to
both, the resulting binding equation for A, as modiﬁed by the
presence of B and C, is particularly simple, as the allosteric
constant L can now be replaced by an apparent value Lapp
that increases with the inhibitor concentration and decreases
with the activator concentration, reﬂecting the capacity of
inhibitors to displace the equilibrium away from the state
that favors substrate binding, and of activators to displace it
towards the same state:

(12.21)
When ligands do not bind exclusively to one or other state,
the behavior is naturally more complicated, but one can still
get a reasonable idea of the possibilities by examining Figure
12.34 in the light of equation 12.21.
High concentrations of allosteric effectors of either sort
clearly tend to decrease the cooperativity, as they make the
protein resemble either pure R or pure T, but there may be
effects in the opposite direction at low concentrations if the
value of L (the value of Lapp in the absence of effectors) is
not optimal. In Figure 12.34, for example, the steepest curve
occurs with L = 100, and that for L = 10 is less steep: any con-
centration of activator tends to decrease Lapp, taking it further
from Lapp = 100, and hence making it less cooperative.
However, adding an allosteric inhibitor initially increases
the cooperativity, to a maximum at Lapp = 100, but further
increases in inhibitor concentration tend to decrease it. If the
value of L were greater than 100 rather than less, it would
be the activator that would increase the cooperativity at low
concentrations, whereas the inhibitor would decrease the co-
operativity at all concentrations.
These tendencies are not
entirely obvious from examination of the curves in Figure
12.34, because in the middle of the range the differences in
steepness are not immediately apparent to the eye. However,
one can get a correct impression of the directions in which the
steepness changes from the fact that the curves at the extremes
are noticeably less steep than the one in the middle.

12. Regulation of Enzyme Activity
A complication arises if we consider an ordinary (non-
allosteric) competitive inhibitor that binds to the R state at
exactly the same sites as the substrate A. This is considered
in Problem 12.5 at the end of this chapter.
The binding
properties of phosphofructokinase from Escherichia coli were
thoroughly studied by Blangy and co-workers: over a wide

range of concentrations of ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate,
an allosteric activator and inhibitor respectively, the binding
of the substrate fructose 6-phosphate proved to agree well
with the predictions of the symmetry model. Nonetheless,
it cannot be regarded as a universal explanation of binding
cooperativity, because it cannot explain the negative coopera-
tivity observed for some enzymes, and some of its postulates
are not altogether convincing. The central assumption of con-
formational symmetry is not readily explainable in structural
terms, for example, and for many enzymes it is necessary
to postulate the occurrence of a “perfect K system”, which
means that the R and T states of the enzyme have identical
catalytic properties despite having grossly different binding
properties. These and other questionable aspects of the sym-
metry model have stimulated the search for alternatives.

Figure 12.37. Comparison
between the simplest forms of
the principal models of
cooperativity.
The other major model of cooperativity is the sequential model
of Koshland and co-workers, which we shall consider for-
mally in the next section. First, however, it will be useful to
pause to compare it with the symmetry model just discussed.
Both assume that cooperativity arises from interactions be-
tween subunits in an oligomeric protein, and thus neither can
explain how a monomeric protein might exhibit cooperativity
(Section 12.9), and both assume that the interactions result
§12.9, pages 320–323
from the possibility of each subunit to exist in more than
one conformation. However, the symmetry model treats the
J. E. Haber and D. E. Koshland,
Jr. (1967) “Relation of protein
subunit interactions to the
molecular species observed
during cooperative binding of
ligands” Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences 58,
2087–2093
different conformations as existing independently of ligand
binding, whereas the sequential model treats changes in con-
formation as intimately linked to the binding of ligand. Haber
and Koshland showed how both models can be regarded as
special cases of a general model in which all possible com-
binations of degree of conformational change and degree of
binding can exist.
For a tetrameric protein with the four
subunits arranged as a square, therefore, one could suppose
that 25 different states could exist, as shown in Figure 12.37.
12.7 The model of Koshland, Némethy and Filmer
313
However, the symmetry model considers only the ten states
in the ﬁrst and last columns, whereas the sequential model
considers only the states along the diagonal.
Strictly we should talk of the simplest symmetry and se-
quential models,18 because the proponents of both models
have at times considered variants in which some of the postu-
lates are relaxed. However, even the simplest versions make
predictions that are often difﬁcult to distinguish experimen-
tally, and very little is gained by making them more com-
plicated than necessary. Over the years since these models
were proposed, many authors have proposed general models
of which they are special cases. However, although this is
obviously possible, as Figure 12.37 shows, it is not obviously
useful, except as a purely qualitative exercise.
12.7
The sequential model of Koshland,
Némethy and Filmer
12.7.1
Postulates
Although the symmetry model incorporates the idea of pur-
posive conformational ﬂexibility, it departs from the theory of
induced ﬁt in permitting ligands to bind to both R and T con-
formations, albeit with different binding constants. Koshland
and co-workers showed that a more orthodox application of

and D. Filmer (1966) “Compari-
son of experimental binding
data and theoretical models in
proteins containing subunits”

induced ﬁt, known as the sequential model, could account for
cooperativity equally well. Like Monod and co-workers, they
postulated the existence of two conformations, which they
termed the A and B conformations, corresponding to the T
and R conformations respectively.19
This inversion of the
order in which they are usually spoken has sometimes been
a source of confusion, and for that reason, and also to allow
continued use of A as a symbol for substrate, as elsewhere
in this book, the symbols T and R will be used here20. In
contrast with the symmetry model, Koshland and co-workers
assumed that the R conformation was induced by ligand
18Koshland himself always insisted on this qualiﬁcation, but few others
have done so.
19This is a word to be used sparingly, but here it is essential: A corre-
sponds to T; B corresponds to R.
20Koshland and co-workers also followed the “hemoglobin convention”
of expressing their model in terms of association constants, but dissociation
constants are used here to facilitate comparison with the symmetry model,
and to maintain consistency with the rest of this book. As a result, most of
the equilibrium constants are the reciprocals of the corresponding constants
given in the original paper.
314
12. Regulation of Enzyme Activity
binding, so that substrate binds only to the R conformation,
the R conformation exists only with substrate bound to it, and
the T conformation exists only with substrate not bound to it.
Koshland and co-workers postulated that cooperativity
arose because the properties of each subunit were modiﬁed
by the conformational states of the neighboring subunits. The
same assumption is implicit in the symmetry model, but it
is emphasized in the sequential model, which is more con-
cerned with the details of interaction, and avoids the arbitrary
assumption that all subunits must exist simultaneously in the
same conformation. Hence conformational hybrids, such as
TR in a dimer, or T3R, T2R2 and TR3 in a tetramer, are not
merely allowed, but follow directly from the assumption of
strict induced ﬁt.
Because the symmetry model was not concerned with the
details of subunit interactions, there was no need in Sec-
tion 12.5 to consider the geometry of subunit association,
§12.5, pages 304–312
the quaternary structure of the protein. By contrast, the se-
quential model does require consideration of geometry, for
any protein with more than two subunits, because different
arrangements of subunits result in different binding equa-
tions. Here we shall consider a dimer for simplicity (Figure

12.38), and the geometry can then be ignored, but it cannot be
ignored when extending the treatment to trimers, tetramers
and so on.
The emphasis on geometry and the need to treat each
geometry separately have given rise to the widespread but
erroneous idea that the sequential model is more general and
complicated than the symmetry model, but for any given
geometry the two models are about equally complicated and
neither is a special case of the other. As illustrated in Figure
12.37 above, they can both can be generalized into the same
general model, by relaxing the symmetry requirement of the
symmetry model and the strict induced-ﬁt requirement of the
sequential model.
To see how a binding equation is built up in the sequential
model, consider the changes that occur when a molecule T2
binds one molecule of A to become RTA, as illustrated in
detail in Figure 12.39:
1. There is a statistical factor of 2, because there are two
equivalent ways of choosing one out of two subunits
to bind A. (The word “equivalent” is essential here,
because nonequivalent choices would lead to distin-
guishable molecules that would have to be treated sep-
arately.)

315
2. The T:T interface is lost when we consider a T subunit
in isolation. We include no equilibrium constant for this,
for the reasons given in paragraph 5 below.
3. One subunit must undergo the conformational change T
→R, a change represented by the notional equilibrium
constant Kt = [T]/[R] for an isolated subunit.
In the
simplest version of the sequential model Kt is tacitly
assumed to be large, so that the change occurs to a
negligible extent if it is not induced by ligand binding.

tion, represented by [A]/KA, where KA is the intrinsic
dissociation constant [R][A]/[RA] for binding of A to
an isolated subunit in the R conformation.
5. In a dimer there is one interface across which the two
subunits can interact. In the initial T2 molecule these
are evidently two T subunits, so it is a T:T interface, but
in RTA it becomes a T:R interface, a change represented
by a notional equilibrium constant KR:T = [R:T]/[T:T].
Notice that this deﬁnition means that the stability is of
the T:R interface is deﬁned in terms of a change from the
T:T interface as not as a absolute measure. That is why
no equilibrium constant was introduced in step 2 to rep-
resent the loss of the T:T interface. In the original discus-
sion by Koshland and co-workers there was some con-
fusion about whether subunit interaction terms should
be regarded as absolute measures of interface stabil-
ity (logically requiring an additional constant KT:T), or
whether they should be regarded as measures of the
stability relative to a standard state (the T:T interface).
The latter interpretation is just as rigorous, simpler to
apply (because it leads to constants that are inherently
dimensionless, so there is no question of ignoring di-
mensions), and leads to simpler equations with fewer
constants; it will be used here.
12.7.2
Algebraic analysis
Putting all this together we may write down the following
expression for the concentration of RTA in terms of those of
T2 and A:
[RTA] = 2[T2][A]KR:T

12. Regulation of Enzyme Activity
Although using a dimer as an example allows the sequential
model to be explained with minimal complications, it leaves
one or two essential aspects of the model unexplained, so
we must pause brieﬂy to consider what expression would
result from applying the same rules to the formation of a
molecule R2T2A2 from a tetramer T4. We cannot now ignore
geometry, because there are at least three different possible
arrangements. Here we shall suppose that they interact as
if arranged at the corners of a square, and that of the two
different ways in which two ligand molecules can be bound to
such a molecule (Figure 12.40) we are dealing with the one in
which the two ligand molecules are on adjacent (rather than
diagonal) subunits. This gives a concentration of

As there is now a new kind of interface between the two

we need a new kind of subunit interaction constant, KR:R,
which, like KT:R, is deﬁned relative to the T:T interface, but
otherwise equation 12.23 is constructed in just the same way
as equation 12.22, from the same components. A tetrahedral
geometry, as in Figure 12.41, requires a different analysis.
Returning now to the dimer, we can write down an ex-
pression for the concentration of R2A2 according to the same
principles:

The sequential model is closely concerned with subunit
interactions, and the essential question that an equation such
as equation 12.25 answers is how binding of a ligand is af-
fected by the stability of the mixed interface R:T relative to
mean stability of the interfaces R:R and T:T between subunits
in like conformations. Inspection of equation 12.25 shows that
making KR:T smaller increases the importance of the outer

terms with respect to the inner, but this can be made clearer
by deﬁning a constant c2 = K2
R:T/KR:R to express this relative
stability. (It may seem surprising at ﬁrst sight that there is no
mention of the T:T interface in this deﬁnition, but remember
that both KR:T and KR:R already deﬁne the stabilities of the R:T
and R:R interfaces relative to the T:T interface.)
If KR:T is replaced by cK1/2
R:R using this deﬁnition, it then
becomes clear that ¯K = KtKA/K1/2
R:R always occurs as a unit: its
three components are conceptually distinct, but they cannot
be separated experimentally by means of binding measure-
ments. The equation can thus be simpliﬁed in appearance
without loss of generality by writing it in terms of c and ¯K:
y =
c[A]
¯K
+ [A]2
¯K2
1 + 2c[A]
¯K

(12.5)
it applies not only to dimers, but also to trimers, tetramers,
and so on, regardless of how the subunits are arranged. The
deﬁnition of ¯K is a little more complicated: it always con-
tains KtKA as an inseparable unit (as follows from steps 1
and 2 in the description above of how any binding process
is decomposed into different notional components); on the
other hand, the power to which KR:R is raised in the de-
nominator varies with the number of subunits and with the
number of R:R interfaces that the fully liganded molecule
contains. However, this has little importance: the important
point is that regardless of quaternary structure and geometry
the range of binding behavior possible for a single ligand in
the sequential model is determined by two parameters, one to
represent the stability of the R:T interface with respect to the
R:R and T:T interface, the other an average dissociation con-
stant for the complete binding process from fully unliganded
to fully liganded protein. This is the geometric mean21 of the
Adair dissociation constants, as may be seen for the dimer by
writing these explicitly, after comparing equation 12.26 with
equation 12.5 (repeated above in the margin):
K1 =

K2 = c ¯K
(12.27)
with ratio K2/K1 = c2.
21The geometric mean of n values is the nth root of their product. For
example, the geometric mean of 2, 3, 5 and 7 is about 3.8, because 3.84 ≈
210 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7.

Properties implied by the binding equation
It is now clear that the degree of cooperativity, and hence
the shape of the binding curve, depends only on the value
of c. As illustrated in Figure 12.42, values of c < 1 generate
positive cooperativity and values of c > 1 generate negative
cooperativity. The effect of varying ¯K is not shown (to avoid
making the ﬁgure too complicated), but can be stated simply:

it has no effect on the shapes of the curves when ln[A] is the
abscissa (and affects only the scaling with other variables as
abscissa), but simply causes them to be shifted to the right (if
¯K increases) or left (if ¯K decreases); in other words, ¯K has no
effect on the degree of cooperativity. The curve for c = 10 is
doubly sigmoid, with a noticeable decrease in slope around
half-saturation. This effect becomes more pronounced with
larger values of c and leads to half-of-the-sites reactivity.
The cooperative case generates a visibly sigmoid curve
when a linear scale is used for the ligand concentration (Fig-
ure 12.43), but the negatively cooperative curve is qualita-
tively similar to the noncooperative curve. As with the sym-
metry model, the degree of deviation from linearity is very
evident in Scatchard plots (Figure 12.44).
It would be convenient if there were a simple correspon-
dence between the parameters of the sequential model and
those of the Hill equation ( equation 12.1 ), but although, as
we have seen, the degree of cooperativity depends only on c,
there is no one-to-one relationship between h and c, as h varies
with the degree of saturation and c does not. By contrast, the
relationship between ¯K and K0.5, the half-saturation concen-
tration, is as simple as one could ask: they are identical.
As incorrect statements are sometimes found in the litera-
ture one should notice that in the sequential model the shape
of the curve is deﬁned by fewer parameters than in the sym-
metry model (one instead of two). Thus the capacity of the
sequential model to explain negative cooperativity whereas
the symmetry model cannot is not a consequence of the large
number of constants considered in deriving the sequential
model (Kt, KA, KR:T and KR:R).
More subtle misconceptions about the sequential model
are implied by some authors’ use of names such as “Adair–
Koshland model” or “Pauling–Koshland model” for it. Al-

though crediting it to Adair, as done, for example, by Wim-
penny and Moroz, correctly implies that the sequential model
is a special case of the Adair model it also incorrectly implies
that the symmetry model is not. In reality, both models are

expressible in terms of Adair constants (equations 12.19 and
12.27), as, indeed, any valid equation to describe binding of a
ligand to a macromolecule at equilibrium must be. The sim-
plest test of meaningfulness that one can apply to a proposed
equation written for this purpose is adherence to the Adair
equation; equations that are not special cases of the Adair
equation, such as some that Weber and Anderson proposed
for lactate dehydrogenase, generally violate the principle of
microscopic reversibility (Section 5.6).22

Likewise, some of the mathematics in the sequential model
is the same as that applied by Pauling to hemoglobin, but

equilibrium of hemoglobin and
its structural interpretation”

Academy of Sciences 21, 186–191
the underlying concepts are different: he was working at a
time when it was reasonable to suppose that the oxygen-
binding sites of hemoglobin were close enough together in
space to interact in an ordinary chemical way, and there was
no implication of conformational interactions.
For a positively cooperative dimer there is no difference
between the binding curves that the two models can predict:
any value less than 1 of the ratio K2/K1 of Adair constants that
one can give is consistent with the other. It is thus impossible
to distinguish between them on the basis of binding exper-
iments with a dimer. In principle they become different for
trimers and higher oligomers, because the symmetry model
then allows the binding curves plotted as a function of ln[A]
(as in Figure 12.34) to become unsymmetrical about the half-
saturation point, whereas the corresponding curves gener-
ated by the sequential model (as in Figure 12.42) are always
symmetrical with respect to rotation through 180◦about this
point.
However, the departures from symmetry are quite
small, and highly accurate data are needed to detect them.
Moreover, the greatest degree of cooperativity occurs in the
symmetry model when Lcn = 1, and as this is also the condi-
tion for a symmetrical binding curve in the symmetry model
one may expect that for at least some enzymes evolution will
have eliminated any asymmetry that might have existed.

dently suggested that cooperativity might in some circum-
stances result from the existence of an equilibrium between
protein forms in different states of aggregation, such as a
monomer and a tetramer. If a ligand has different intrinsic
dissociation constants for the two forms, then this model
predicts cooperativity even if there is no interaction between
the binding sites in the tetramer. Conceptually the model is
rather similar to the symmetry model, and the cooperativity
arises in a similar way, but the equations are more compli-
cated, because they need to take account of the dependence
of the degree of association on the protein concentration.

Consequently, in contrast to the equations for the symmetry
and sequential models, this concentration does not cancel
from the expressions for the saturation curves. This type of
model is much more amenable to experimental veriﬁcation
than the other models we have considered, because the ef-
fects of protein concentration ought to be easily observable.
They have indeed been observed for a number of enzymes,
such as glutamate dehydrogenase (Frieden and Colman) and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ovádi and co-
workers), and other examples were noted by Kurganov, who
discussed association–dissociation models in detail.
12.9
Kinetic cooperativity
All the models discussed in the earlier part of this chapter
have been essentially equilibrium models that can be applied
to kinetic experiments only by assuming that v/V is a true
measure of y. Cooperativity can also arise for purely kinetic
reasons, in mechanisms that would show no cooperativity if
binding could be measured at equilibrium. This was known
from the studies of Ferdinand and of Rabin and others when
the classic models of cooperativity were being developed, but
at that time there did not seem to be experimental examples
of cooperativity in monomeric enzymes. As a result it was
widely assumed that even if multiple binding sites were not
strictly necessary for generating cooperativity they provided
the only mechanisms actually found in nature, and the purely
kinetic models were given little attention. However, rat-liver
hexokinase D provided an example of positive cooperativity
in a monomeric enzyme, making it clear that models for such
properties would need to be considered seriously.
Hexokinase D is an enzyme found in the liver and pan-
creatic islets of vertebrates. Because of a mistaken perception
12.9 Kinetic cooperativity
321
that it is more speciﬁc for glucose than the other vertebrate
hexokinases, discussed by Cárdenas and co-workers, it is
frequently known in the literature as “glucokinase”, but this
name will not be used here. It is monomeric over a wide range
of conditions, including those used in its assay (Holroyde and
co-workers; Cárdenas and co-workers), but it shows marked
deviations from Michaelis–Menten kinetics when the glucose
concentration is varied at constant concentrations of the other
substrate, MgATP2−(Niemeyer and co-workers; Storer and
Cornish-Bowden).
When replotted as Hill plots, the data

low value, possibly 1.0, at vanishingly small MgATP2−con-
centrations. On the other hand, it shows no deviations from
Michaelis–Menten kinetics with respect to MgATP2−itself.
Other examples of cooperativity in monomeric enzymes
are not abundant, but they exist (see Cornish-Bowden and
Cardenas), and indicate that mechanisms that generate ki-

netic cooperativity can no longer be ignored.
I shall con-
sider two such mechanisms in this section.
The older is
due to Ferdinand, who pointed out that the steady-state rate
equation for the random-order ternary-complex mechanism
(Section 8.3.2) is much more complicated than equation 8.7
if it is derived without assuming substrate-binding steps to
be at equilibrium; he suggested that a model of this kind,
which he called a preferred-order mechanism, might provide an
explanation for the cooperativity of phosphofructokinase. It
is clear enough from consideration of the method of King and
Altman (Chapter 5) that deviations from Michaelis–Menten
§8.3.2, pages 200–201
Chapter 5, pages 107–132
kinetics ought to occur with this mechanism, but this explana-
tion is rather abstract and algebraic. In conceptual terms the
point is that both pathways for substrate binding may make
signiﬁcant contributions to the total ﬂux through the reaction,
but the relative magnitudes of these contributions change
as the substrate concentrations change. Thus the observed
behavior corresponds approximately to one pathway at low
concentrations, but to the other at high concentrations.
Ricard and co-workers developed an alternative model of
kinetic cooperativity from earlier ideas of Rabin and White-
head. Their model is known as a mnemonical model (from the
Greek for memory),23 because it depends on the idea that the
§8.4.1, pages 204–207
23Here we are assuming that the reaction follows a ternary-complex mech-
anism. Memory effects have also been observed with substituted-enzyme
mechanisms, but then they do not generate cooperativity but instead can
produce a dependence of the speciﬁcity constant of one substrate on the
identity of the other, as discussed in Section 8.4.1.

enzyme changes conformation relatively slowly, and is thus
able to “remember” the conformation that it had during a
recent catalytic cycle. It is shown (in a simpliﬁed form) in Fig-
ure 12.45a. It postulates that there two forms E and E′ of the
free enzyme differ in their afﬁnities for A, the ﬁrst substrate to
bind; in addition equilibration between E, E′, A and EA must
be slow relative to the maximum ﬂux through the reaction.
With these postulates, the behavior of hexokinase D is readily
explained. As the concentration of B is lowered, the rate at
which EA is converted into EAB and thence into products
must eventually become slow enough for E, E′, A and EA to
equilibrate. At vanishingly small concentrations of B, there-

Bowden (1977) “Kinetic
evidence for a ‘mnemonical’
mechanism for rat liver
glucokinase” Biochemical
Journal 165, 61–69
fore, the binding of A should behave like an ordinary equi-
librium, with no cooperativity, because there is only a single
binding site. At high concentrations of B, on the other hand, it
becomes possible for EA to be removed so fast that it cannot
equilibrate and the laws of equilibria no longer apply (Storer
and Cornish-Bowden).
Deviations from Michaelis–Menten
kinetics are then possible because at low concentrations of A
the two forms of free enzyme can equilibrate (Figure 12.45b),
favoring E′, but at high concentrations they cannot (Figure
12.45c), leaving the free enzyme predominantly in the form E
released after the chemical reaction.
In the mnemonical mechanism as proposed for wheat-
germ hexokinase by Ricard and co-workers the same form
of EA complex is produced from both forms of free enzyme
when substrate binds to them. However, this is not a neces-
12.9 Kinetic cooperativity
323
sary feature of the model, and the slow-transition model devel-
oped a little earlier by Ainslie and co-workers supposes that
two different conformational states exist during the whole
catalytic cycle, with transitions between them possible at any
point that occur at rates that are slow compared with the cat-
alytic rate. In general, any model that allows substrate to bind
in two or more parallel steps will generate a rate equation
with terms in the square or higher power of the concentration
of the substrate concerned, so there is no limit to the models
of kinetic cooperativity that can be devised. Unfortunately it
is quite difﬁcult in practice to distinguish between them or to
assert with much conﬁdence that one ﬁts the facts better than
another. Certainly, both the mnemonical and slow-transition

models are able to explain the behavior of hexokinase D
adequately, as Cárdenas discusses thoroughly in her book.
The existence for multiple conformation in the hexokinase D
reaction was originally deduced from kinetic considerations,
but there is now abundant evidence, for example from nuclear
magnetic resonance studies by Larion and co-workers, that
the conformational changes are real and large, as illustrated
above in Figure 12.30.
Summary of Chapter 12
• Michaelis–Menten kinetics allow very little sensitivity to
§12.1, pages 281–286
changes in conditions, and so effective regulation of metab-
olism requires certain enzymes, known as regulatory en-
zymes, to follow more complicated kinetics.
• Cooperativity is the property whereby an enzyme can have
§12.1.3, page 284
a steep dependence on substrate or inhibitor concentration.
• Allosteric effects allow regulation by molecules that do not
§12.1.4, pages 285–286
bind at the same sites as the substrates and products.
• The Hill equation is useful for expressing the degree of
§§12.2.1–12.2.2, pages 286–288
cooperativity in quantitative terms, but it is not based on a
realistic mechanism.
• The symmetry model of Monod, Wyman and Changeux
§§12.5–12.6, pages 304–312
explains cooperativity in terms of an oligomeric protein with
all subunits in the same conformation at any time.
• The sequential model of Koshland, Némethy and Filmer
§§12.6–12.7, pages 312–319
explains cooperativity in terms of interactions between the
subunits of an oligomeric protein.

12. Regulation of Enzyme Activity
• Association-dissociation models of cooperativity explain

it in terms of effects of ligands on the state of oligomerization

12.6 In the sequential model no one-to-one relationship exists
between the Hill coefﬁcient h and the parameter c that
deﬁnes the degree of cooperativity. There is, however, a
one-to-one relationship between c and the extreme value
of h: in the simplest form of the model this extreme
occurs when the ligand concentration [A] is equal to the
mean dissociation constant ¯K. Taking h as the slope (at
any value of [A]) of a plot of ln[y/(1 −y)] against ln [A],
show that h can be expressed as [A]/[y(1 −y)] multi-

value of h in terms of c.

Multienzyme Systems
13.1
Enzymes in their physiological context
13.1.1
Enzymes as components of systems
Most of this book has considered enzymes one at a time,
even though in living organisms virtually all enzymes act as
components of systems; their substrates are products of other
enzymes, and their products are substrates of other enzymes.
For most of the history of enzymology there has been little to
connect the sorts of kinetic measurements people make with
the physiological roles of the enzymes they study: after an
enzyme has been identiﬁed from some physiological observa-
tion, the ﬁrst thing that an enzymologist does is to purify it,
or at least separate it from its physiological neighbors. Nearly
all kinetic studies of enzymes are thus made on enzymes
that have been deliberately taken out of physiological context.
This may well be necessary for understanding the chemical
mechanisms of enzyme catalysis, but one cannot obtain a full
understanding of how enzymes fulﬁll their roles in metabolic
pathways if they are only examined under conditions where
all other aspects of the pathway are suppressed. One might
have expected the discovery of feedback inhibition and the
associated properties of cooperative and allosteric interac-
tions to have reestablished the importance of enzymes as
physiological elements; in reality it increased the separation
between the practice of enzymology and the physiology of
enzymes, because it started to seem natural to think that a few

13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
enzymes, such as phosphofructokinase, could be classiﬁed as
“regulatory enzymes”, and the rest could be largely ignored
in discussions of physiological regulation. The most extreme
form of this idea is to think that all that one needs to do
to understand the regulation of a pathway is to identify the
regulated step, usually assumed to be unique, and study all
the interactions of the enzyme catalyzing it.
The mechanisms discussed in the previous chapter con-
stitute an essential component in the total understanding of
enzyme physiology, but they leave an important question
unanswered: how do we know that an effect on the activity
of any enzyme will be translated into an effect on the ﬂux of
metabolites through a pathway? This can only be answered
by moving away from studying enzymes one at a time and
towards a systemic treatment, that is to say one that considers
how the components of a system affect one another.
This
is far from trivial, even in the steady state, even though the
analysis of the steady-state kinetic behavior of an individual
isolated enzyme may now be regarded as a solved problem.
Analytical expressions for the steady-state rates do not in gen-
eral exist, even for two-enzyme systems, and the difﬁculties
rapidly increase as more enzymes are added. There is nothing
in ordinary enzyme kinetics to justify an assumption about
how even complete knowledge of the rate equation for a
particular “regulatory enzyme” would allow any quantitative
prediction of the effect that a change in its activity would have
on the ﬂux through the pathway in which it is embedded. In
this chapter, therefore, we examine the relationships between
the kinetics of pathways and the kinetic properties of their
component enzymes.
13.1.2
Moiety conservation
In Section 8.1 I emphasized that the distinction between
substrates and coenzymes has no meaning when discussing
enzyme mechanisms, but I noted that a different view was
possible in discussing metabolism. The point is that if all the

simpliﬁed picture of the meta-

(omitting several steps and
various co-reactants). In the
steady state the overall process
involves no net change in the
individual concentrations of
NADoxidized and NADreduced,
because every molecule of
NADoxidized consumed in the
ﬁrst step is regenerated in the
second. NADoxidized and
NADreduced together constitute

§8.1, pages 189–190
attention is focused on a single two-substrate enzyme, hexok-
inase for example, it is irrelevant that one of its substrates,
glucose, is involved in relatively few other metabolic reac-
tions, whereas the other, ATP, is involved in many. However,
as soon as one comes to place hexokinase in its physiological
context this difference between the two substrates becomes
highly relevant. The common coenzymes, ATP and ADP, the
oxidized and reduced forms of NAD (Figure 13.1), and so on,
13.1 Enzymes in their physiological context
329
all exist as members of pairs of metabolites such that the sum
of the concentrations of the two members is constant, or at
least it changes on a slower time scale than the one being
considered, whereas their ratio varies. Thus in many contexts
the appropriate variable to consider is the ratio of ATP and
ADP concentrations, not the two concentrations treated as
independent. Notice that each pair of concentrations treated
in this way results in a decrease of one in the total number
of variables in the system:1 although this is not a point that
will be discussed any further in this chapter, it is important
to take account of it in computer models of metabolism (Sec-
tion 13.10), which are typically underdetermined if there are
§13.10, pages 368–373
no constraints on the values of variables (in other words they
do not contain enough information to deﬁne a unique steady
state).
When ATP is converted into ADP and back again, the ADP
fragment common to both molecules remains unchanged.
In this context it is called a moiety and the organization of
metabolism to maintain its concentration constant is called
moiety conservation. Much of the discussion in this chapter
can be adapted to take account of moiety conservation, which
Hofmeyr and co-workers analyzed by treating the ratio of
the two concentrations concerned as a third kind of variable,

adding this to the metabolic ﬂuxes and metabolite concentra-
tions that will be the primary focus of the chapter.
13.1.3
Enzymes in permeabilized cells
For many years enzymes have not only usually been puriﬁed
before characterizing their kinetic behavior, but they have also
usually been studied in unnatural buffers chosen for reasons
of reproducibility, stability or just convenience.
In mecha-
nistic work this is not a major issue, as it does not require a
great leap of faith to suppose that a mechanism established
in artiﬁcial conditions applies qualitatively to catalysis in the
living cell, even if some quantitative details may be incor-
rect. However, for understanding in quantitative terms how
an enzyme fulﬁlls its physiological role such details become
too important to set aside.
There is a need, therefore, for
experiments to be done in closer to natural conditions than
those that exist in a typical spectrophotometric assay. One
1Remember that this assumes that the system is being studied on a time
scale in which the total is constant. For NAD it may be more complicated
if an enzyme such as NAD kinase is present, as this can change the balance
between NAD and NADP.

possibility might seem to be to use cell extracts obtained as
the water-soluble fraction after rupturing the cells and cen-
trifuging to separate the solid debris. However, an extract
of this kind is not much more natural than a solution of the
puriﬁed enzyme in a phosphate buffer, and any properties
associated with cell membranes or other elements of cell or-
ganization are irretrievably lost when the cell is destroyed,
even though they may be essential for the proper function of
the enzyme in vivo, as emphasized by Clegg and Jackson. A

better solution is to use the permeabilized cells introduced by
Reeves and Sols, and by Serrano and co-workers: these can
be obtained by using drugs such as digitonin to create pores
that allow small molecules to diffuse freely while leaving the
basic structure in place and keeping proteins and other large
molecules conﬁned to their natural locations. Experiments in
these conditions are said to be done in situ, an intermediate
stage that combines much of the naturalness of experiments
in vivo with much of the experimental control possible in
experiments in vitro.
Methylglyoxal metabolism in yeast illustrates questions

by the hydrolase, so it acts catalytically in the pathway as a
whole, though not in either reaction considered by itself) one
could use glutathione to control whether the pathway was
active or inactive, and thus measure other ﬂuxes, such as the
glycolytic ﬂux, with and without the methylglyoxal pathway.

control analysis, which originated from work of Kacser and
Burns and of Heinrich and Rapoport, and is now by far the
most widely known and used.
In its simplest form, it is
concerned with the steady states of systems of enzymes that
connect a series of metabolites, with two or more reservoirs
of metabolites whose concentrations are ﬁxed independently
of the enzymes in the system, and can thus be considered as
“external” to it. The reservoirs include at least one source,
from which metabolites ﬂow, and at least one sink, into which
they ﬂow. Neither of these ﬂows need be irreversible, and
the classiﬁcation into sources and sinks is not absolute: both
might well be considered as internal metabolites of a larger
system under different circumstances. Nonetheless, in any
one analysis it is essential to be precise about which metabo-
lites are considered internal and which external, and it is ac-

Figure 13.2. A metabolic path-
way of ﬁve enzymes. Although
ultimately a metabolic system
consists of an entire cell, or even
an entire organism, some deg-
ree of isolation is needed for
analyzing it. In the example
shown, the heavily shaded part
of the diagram, showing con-
nections to X0, S3 and X5, is con-
sidered to be “outside the
system”, so that X0 is a source
metabolite and X5 is a sink
metabolite even though in a
larger system they would be
intermediates. A higher degree
of isolation, represented by the
unshaded part of the diagram,
is needed for considering how

metabolites. The elasticities

system is considered to be the pathway from a source X0 to a
sink X5, with internal metabolites S1, S2, S3 and S4: the heavily
shaded part of the scheme, including the external connections
to these metabolites and to S3, is considered to be outside
the system. In addition to the metabolites connected by the
enzymes, there can be any number of external effectors with
ﬁxed concentrations. Few reactants in a living organism are
external, but there are so many reactions to be considered
that the entire system is difﬁcult to comprehend. To make
metabolism manageable for analysis, therefore, the system
must be deﬁned as just a part of the whole organism, and
the metabolites at the interfaces with the rest of the organism
must be deﬁned as external.
In the simplest version of metabolic control analysis con-
sidered here, each rate must be proportional to the concen-
tration of exactly one enzyme, and no enzyme can act on
more than one reaction in the system. However, these are
not absolute restrictions as they can easily be relaxed at the
cost of some additional complications in the analysis. Various
sources of information are listed in Table 13.1.

Deﬁnition of elasticity
Enzyme kinetic behavior is usually expressed in terms of rate
equations such as the reversible Michaelis–Menten equation:

The reversible form should be preferred for considering
physiological states, because products are normally always
present.
In metabolic simulations one should be cautious
before writing irreversible equations, because doing so can
generate entirely false results about the behavior of a path-
way; for example, irreversible equations can suggest that no
steady state is possible in conditions where more realistic,
13.3 Elasticities

albeit more complicated, equations yield a stable steady state.
This contrasts with the usual conditions in the cuvette, where
it is easy to ensure irreversibility. In a metabolic pathway the H
ENRIK KACSER (1918–
1995) was born in
Câmpina, Roumania,
of an Austrian mother and a
Hungarian father, who worked
there as an oil engineer. He was
educated in Berlin and Belfast,
where he trained as chemist. He
moved to Edinburgh in 1952,
and spent his entire career
there. By 1973 his research
work, with just one publication
in the preceding eight years,
must have seemed to his
colleagues to be over, but this
would have been an illusion:
although his paper with James
Burns did not immediately
have very much impact, it came
to be seen as the start of a new
ﬁeld, encompassing the most
successful approach to the
analysis of biochemical systems
that has yet appeared. From
1973 until his sudden death,
Kacser was not merely active
but increasingly active, as the
undisputed leader of his ﬁeld.
S
AMUEL RAPOPORT (1912–
2004) inspired much
of the work described in
this chapter, even if his name
does not appear explicitly. He
was born in Volochysk, in
Ukraine, but his family moved
to Odessa and then to Vienna,
where he studied medicine and
chemistry. Subsequently he
worked as a pediatrician in
Cincinnati, where he was also
an active communist. During
World War II he developed a
method that allowed blood for
transfusion to be stored for
three weeks, instead of the
previous maximum of one,
thereby saving many lives. He
developed a long-term interest
in erythrocyte metabolism and
the kinetics of multienzyme
systems. In 1950 he was forced
by political problems to leave
the USA, and became the
leading ﬁgure in East German
biochemistry.
essential characteristic is not reversibility as such, but sensi-
tivity of the early steps to conditions at the end: if feedback
loops or other mechanisms supply this information to the
early enzymes then it may make little difference whether or
not the small degree of reversibility of reactions with large
equilibrium constants is taken into account, as discussed by
Cornish-Bowden and Cárdenas. It is also important to distin-
guish between the possibility of a reverse reaction, a property
of the negative term in the numerator of the rate expression,
and product sensitivity, a property of positive terms in the
denominator.
It is perfectly possible, and indeed common
in practice, for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction to be virtually
irreversible and yet signiﬁcantly inhibited by its product: the
negative numerator term can be negligible even though the
positive denominator product terms are not. It is then safe
to omit the small negative numerator term, but dangerous to
omit denominator product terms.
To investigate enzyme mechanisms by the sort of kinetic
analysis that has occupied most of this book, especially Chap-
ter 8, it is clearly necessary to express the kinetic behavior in
terms of an equation that resembles equation 13.1. However,
in metabolic control analysis one is not much interested in
enzyme mechanisms, not because they are not important but
because a different aspect of the system is at issue. The sort
of question asked is not “how can the variation of v with a be
explained?” but “how much will v change if there is a small
change in a?”, or even “how much will a change if there is a
small change in v?”. This last form of the question reminds
us that in living systems the distinction between independent
and dependent variables is much less clear cut than we are
used to in the laboratory.
In a typical steady-state kinetic
experiment, we normally decide what the concentrations are
going to be and then measure the rates that result; in the
cell, both rates and concentrations are properties of the whole
system, and although it may sometimes be possible to regard
the rates as determined by the metabolite concentrations, or
the metabolite concentrations as decided by the rates, the
reality is that both are dependent variables. This point will
be taken up in more detail in Section 13.3.4.
Ordinary kinetic equations like equation 13.1 can certainly
show how a rate responds to a small concentration change,
but they do so in a way that is inconveniently indirect. How-

are the concentrations scaled by the appropriate Michaelis or
inhibition constants. This equation may appear complicated,
but when it is rearranged into the difference between two
fractions, as in the last forms shown, it is seen that both
fractions have simple interpretations: the ﬁrst depends only
on the “disequilibrium”, the departure of the system from
equilibrium, which is measured by Γ/Keq; the second mea-
sures the degree of saturation of the enzyme with the reactant
considered. However, complicated or not, metabolic control
analysis is not usually concerned with the algebraic form of
this derivative, but with its numerical value: if it is zero, v
does not vary with a; if it is positive, v increases as a increases;
if it is negative, v decreases as a increases. Accordingly it
is given a name, the elasticity, and symbol, ε, to express its

The superscript v in the symbol may seem sufﬁciently obvi-
ous to be superﬂuous, but metabolic control analysis is always
concerned with systems of more than one enzyme, and so one
needs a superscript to specify which rate is being considered.
Examination of equation 13.3 in the light of Section 1.2

of this book may suggest that this has been a long-winded
way of introducing a new name for an old concept, as the

elasticity is familiar to all biochemists as the order of reaction.
The only difference is that whereas the recommendations of
the International Union of Biochemistry discourage the use of
this term when its value is not a constant, suggesting apparent
order instead, there is no suggestion either in equation 13.3
or in the way that it was derived that the quantity deﬁned
should be a constant.
However, this recommendation has
not been widely followed; it was designed to avoid conﬂict
with the then newly revised recommendations of the Inter-
national Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, but few bio-
chemists ﬁnd variable orders objectionable. The description
of the curve deﬁned by the Michaelis–Menten equation in
Section 2.3.4 can be interpreted as meaning that there is a

gradual transition from ﬁrst order with respect to substrate at
very low concentrations, passing through nonintegral orders
to approach zero order at saturation, with an order of 0.5
at half-saturation. It is easy to conﬁrm, by putting p = 0
in equation 13.2, that the elasticity behaves in exactly the
same way; it is, in fact, identical to the quantity normally
understood by biochemists as the order of reaction.
The term elasticity comes from econometrics, where it
designates a quantity similar to that in control analysis, but
opposite to it in sign: the elasticity for a commodity is a
percentage decrease in demand divided by the percentage
increase in its price that provoked the decreased demand. This

is an obscure precedent for a biochemical term, and the term
kinetic order used in Savageau’s biochemical systems theory, an
alternative approach that covers much of the same territory as
metabolic control analysis, is much better. Nonetheless, I shall
retain the term elasticity in this chapter, as it, together with its
synonym elasticity coefﬁcient, is in universal use in metabolic
control analysis.
Returning to equation 13.1, we can differentiate it with

has an elasticity of zero with respect to a reaction that it does
not catalyze: an obvious point, perhaps, but worth making
explicitly as it is important in the theory of metabolic control
analysis. Some representative curves are drawn in Figures
13.3–4.
13.3.2
Common properties of elasticities
Although equations 13.4 were derived from a speciﬁc model,
the reversible Michaelis–Menten equation, and their exact
forms are dependent on this model, they illustrate a number
of points that apply fairly generally, some of them universally:
1. Reactant elasticities are normally positive when the di-
rection of disequilibrium is such that the reactant is a
substrate, negative when it is a product.2 Note, how-
ever, that the passage from positive to negative as the
reaction passes from one side of equilibrium to the other
is not via zero, as one might naively guess, but via inﬁn-
ity (Figure 13.4): reactant elasticities are inﬁnite at equi-
librium!
This characteristic underlines the danger of
writing irreversible rate equations to use for computer
simulation. With irreversible reactions, in the absence of
cooperativity and substrate inhibition, substrate elastic-
ities are normally in the range 0 to 1 (Figures 13.3 and 5):
2“Normally” here means that the generalization does not take account of
substrate inhibition or product activation, which generate exceptions to it.
13.3 Elasticities
337
values close to zero are characteristic of high substrate
concentrations, and inﬁnite elasticities are impossible. It
follows that the numerical values of elasticities for such
reactions are entirely different from those likely to be
found in a living cell.

(ai, vi) along a curve a straight
line from the origin (v strictly
proportional to a) through the
same point must cross the curve
with a greater slope than the
curve itself: the dependence of
v on a must therefore be a less
than proportional at that point,
so the elasticity must be less
than 1. Values greater than 1
can, however, occur with
cooperative enzymes: see
Figure 13.6.

When v has a sigmoid depend-
ence on a, a straight line
through origin may cross the
curve twice: at (a1, v1) it has a
lower slope than the curve, so
the elasticity is greater than 1 at
this point. When the same line
crosses at (a3, v3) it has a
greater slope than the curve, so
the elasticity is less than 1, as in
Figure 13.5. At (a2, v2) there is a
different line through the origin
that makes a tangent with the
curve, and so the elasticity is 1
at this point.
2. Enzymes have unit elasticities for their own reactions,
and zero elasticities for other reactions. These gener-
alizations are not universally true, as they depend on
the assumption that each rate is proportional to the
total concentration of one enzyme only. They fail if an
enzyme associates (with itself or with other enzymes
in the system) to produce species with altered kinetic
properties. Much of metabolic control analysis assumes
the truth of these generalizations, and the equations
become considerably more complicated when they fail.
3. Elasticities for nonreactant inhibitors are always nega-
tive. Conversely, elasticities for nonreactant activators
are always positive.
The qualiﬁcation “nonreactant”
can be ignored as long as one remembers that a prod-
uct inhibitor is transformed into a substrate when the
direction of ﬂux changes.
In addition, elasticities for
nonreactant inhibitors and activators are independent
of the degree of disequilibrium (the qualiﬁcation is now
indispensable).
13.3.3
Enzyme kinetics viewed from control analysis
In terms of metabolic control analysis, measuring elasticities
is what enzymologists have been doing since the time of
Michaelis and Menten, even if the term itself is unfamiliar.
Nonetheless, there are important differences in emphasis, and
the measurements made in traditional experiments may not
be useful for metabolic control analysis. In ordinary stud-
ies of enzymes, experiments are usually designed to reveal
information about the mechanism of action.
(Even experi-
menters whose interests are primarily physiological usually
follow procedures that were originally designed to shed light
on mechanisms.)
Because different mechanisms of action
often predict patterns of behavior that differ only slightly,
if at all, one is often forced to design experiments carefully
to illuminate any small deviations from expected behavior
that may exist, and the experiments themselves must be done
with great attention to accuracy. Kinetic analysis frequently
338
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
involves extrapolation of observations to inﬁnite or zero con-
centrations (compare Section 8.4.1).
§8.4.1, pages 204–207
Moreover, experiments are rarely done with anything ap-
proaching a complete system, as it is rare for an enzyme in a
cuvette to encounter even half of the metabolites that might
inﬂuence its activity in the cell; if any additional enzymes
are present they are either trace contaminants with negligible
effect on the enzyme of interest, or they are coupling enzymes
deliberately added in quantities designed to be optimal for
the assay, without any relation to the concentrations that may
exist in the cell.
All of these characteristics are quite inappropriate for
metabolic control analysis. Although one is still interested
in describing the kinetic behavior of an enzyme, the objec-
tive is not to understand the mechanism but to integrate the
kinetic description into a description of the kinetic behavior
of a system—at the simplest level a system of a few enzymes
constituting a pathway, but ultimately a complete organ or
organism. To a good approximation, properties that are at
the limits of accuracy of the equipment, and consequently
are difﬁcult to measure, are not important in the behavior
of the system: if mechanistic differences don’t produce major
differences in kinetic behavior they don’t matter.
On the other hand, one can no longer afford to simplify the
experiment by omitting metabolites that affect the kinetics: all
reactants and effectors should be present at concentrations as
close as possible to those that occur in the cell. This includes
products, of course, and implies that reactions need to be
studied under reversible conditions. Even if the equilibrium
constant strongly favors reaction in one direction, the con-
ditions should be at least in principle reversible; apart from
anything else product inhibition may be signiﬁcant even if the
complete reverse reaction is not.
Despite this emphasis on a complete realistic reaction
mixture, elasticity measurements remain unnatural in one
respect: they refer to an enzyme isolated from its pathway,
treating all concentrations of metabolites that inﬂuence its
activity as constants, and ignoring the effects that other en-
zymes in the pathway may have on these concentrations.
13.3.4
Rates and concentrations as effects, not causes
As I have discussed, rates and intermediate concentrations
are both properties of a whole metabolic system, and neither
13.3 Elasticities
339
of them is an independent variable unless it is explicitly de-
ﬁned as such when specifying the system under study.
One can better understand the importance of this point by
considering a situation opposite to the one usually considered
to apply in the spectrophotometer. Suppose that an enzyme
behaves in the ordinary way, following Michaelis–Menten

kinetics, but an experiment is set up so that the rate is set by
the experimenter and the substrate concentration that results
is measured. It is then appropriate to write the Michaelis–
Menten equation as an expression for a in terms of v rather
than as equation 2.12:
a
Km
=
v/V
1 −v/V
(13.5)
For displaying the results of such an experiment one
should reverse the usual axes, plotting a against v rather
than vice versa. Thus instead of Figure 13.7 (redrawn from
Figure 2.3) we should draw the Michaelis–Menten hyperbola
as shown in Figure 13.8. This is exactly the same curve as that
in Figure 13.7, but its psychological impact is quite different,
as one can see by trying to describe the behavior of the en-
zyme at substrate concentrations around 5Km, or rates around
0.8V. The curve as drawn in Figure 13.7 suggests that this
is rather an uninteresting region where nothing much would
happen if the conditions changed, which would usually be
taken to mean that a changed. But exactly the same starting
point in Figure 13.8 is close to a catastrophe, because only a
20% increase in v will bring the same enzyme, with the same
kinetic properties, to a state where no steady state is possible,
as v will reach V. Neither ﬁgure truly represents conditions
in the cell, because neither a nor v can really be manipulated
independently of the other. However, Figure 13.8 may often
be closer to the reality, because many enzymes in the middles
of pathways may do little other than process substrates as
fast or as slowly as they receive them: such enzymes may in
practice operate at whatever rate is demanded, adjusting the
concentrations around them accordingly. Near-saturation is
thus not a boring state where nothing much happens, but a
state on the verge of catastrophe, a point of view that Atkin-
son in particular has emphasized.

provides an even more striking example that I have discussed
elsewhere. As long as one regards a kinetic equation as an

types of inhibition, competitive and uncompetitive; the dif-
ferences between the various degrees of mixed inhibition are
even smaller. As a result, most inhibitors in the literature are
described as competitive, regardless of the magnitude of any
uncompetitive component, which passes unnoticed by many
experimenters. However, as soon as one considers an enzyme

Equations 13.6 and 13.7 are not just minor variations on one
another;3 they are utterly and irreconcilably different from
one another. As i has a linear effect on a in equation 13.6,
the change in a is always proportionately smaller than the
change in i that provokes it, however large the change in
i may be, as illustrated in Figure 13.9.
In equation 13.7,
however, the presence of i in a negative denominator term
means that the denominator can become zero, making it im-
possible to achieve a steady state. This can happen, moreover,
at quite moderate inhibitor concentrations, as illustrated in
Figure 13.10. If the enzyme is half-saturated in the absence
of inhibitor, for example, then V/v = 2, and it is sufﬁcient for
i ≥Kiu for no steady state to exist. This means that if i exceeds
Kiu the substrate concentration will increase indeﬁnitely and
no steady state will be reached. It is instructive to compare
these two ﬁgures with the corresponding ones in Chapter 6,

of equation 13.7; the difference in numerators has much less
importance. As a result, the behavior of a mixed inhibitor,
deﬁned by equation 13.8, will resemble that of an uncom-
petitive inhibitor even if the competitive component is pre-
dominant, as illustrated in Figure 13.12, which was calculated
for Kiu = 2Kic. The crucial question, therefore, is whether a

It follows, therefore, that competitive inhibition is almost
an irrelevance in the living cell, as quite small changes in
substrate concentration can overcome changes in inhibitor
concentration. For this reason efforts to produce pharmaco-
logically useful compounds by searching for analogs of natu-
ral substrates (substances likely to be competitive inhibitors)
often result in disappointment. Uncompetitive inhibitors, by
contrast, may be expected to have potentially devastating
effects on living cells, and this may be one reason why it is
difﬁcult to ﬁnd clear examples of naturally occurring uncom-
petitive inhibitors.

to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-

Control coefﬁcients
13.4.1
Deﬁnitions
To this point we have only been discussing the ordinary
kinetic behavior of isolated enzymes, albeit in terminology
rather different from that used in mechanistic studies. The
objective of metabolic control analysis is now to determine
how the kinetic behavior of a sequence of enzymes composing
a pathway can be explained in terms of the properties of the
individual isolated enzymes.
If a system such as the one
deﬁned in Figure 13.2 is set up, the concentrations of the
reservoirs X0 and X5 are constant, as are the kinetic properties
of the enzymes, but the individual enzyme rates vi and the
concentrations of the internal metabolites Sj are free to vary.
Even if these concentrations are initially arbitrary, they will
tend to vary so that each approaches a steady state. (A steady
state does not necessarily exist, and if one does exist it is not
necessarily unique: for simplicity, however, I shall assume
that there is a steady state and that it is unique.) Taking S1 as
an example, a steady state implies that the rate v1 at which it is
342
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
supplied must be equal to the rate v2 at which it is consumed.
A steady state for S2 likewise implies v2 = v3 and so on; when
all the metabolites are in steady state all the enzyme rates in
a pathway as simple as that in Figure 13.2 must be equal to
one another, with a value J that is called the ﬂux. If there are
branches or other complications there can be several different
ﬂuxes in the same pathway, and the relationships are more
complicated. However, the principles remain straightforward
and obvious: the total ﬂux into each branch-point metabolite
is equal to the total ﬂux out of it.
Enzyme rates are local properties, because they refer to
enzymes isolated from the system. Steady-state ﬂuxes and
metabolite concentrations, by contrast, are systemic proper-
ties4.
Elasticities (deﬁned in Section 13.3.1) are also local
§13.3.1, pages 332–336
properties, but there are systemic properties analogous to
them that are called control coefﬁcients. Suppose that some
change in an external parameter5 u brings about a change in a
local rate vi when the enzyme Ei is isolated, what is the corre-
sponding effect on the system ﬂux J when Ei is embedded in
the system? This is not known a priori, and the ith ﬂux control
coefﬁcient is deﬁned by the following ratio of derivatives:
CJ
i = ∂ln J
∂ln u
 ∂ln vi
∂ln u = ∂ln J
∂ln vi

because vi is not a true independent variable of the system,
but it is acceptable as long as it is remembered that there is
always an implied external parameter u even if it is not shown
explicitly. This deﬁnition corresponds to the way Heinrich
and Rapoport deﬁned their control strength; in apparent con-
trast, the sensitivity coefﬁcient of Kacser and Burns was deﬁned

each enzyme rate is proportional to the total enzyme concen-
tration, equations 13.9 and 13.10 are equivalent. Equation 13.9
has the advantage of avoiding the widespread misunder-
standing that metabolic control analysis is limited to effects
brought about by changes in enzyme concentration. Initially
it was usual to follow Kacser and Burns in using deﬁnitions
similar to equation 13.10, but there is now a widespread view
that control coefﬁcients ought not to be deﬁned in terms of
any speciﬁc parameter (though see Section 13.4.2), and that
§13.4.2, on the following page
equation 13.9 should be regarded as the fundamental deﬁni-
tion of a control coefﬁcient. The quantity deﬁned by equa-
tion 13.10 is then better regarded as an example of a response
coefﬁcient, which happens to be numerically equal to the cor-
responding control coefﬁcient only because the connecting
elasticity is assumed to be unity (see Section 13.7 below).
§13.7, pages 356–359
These deﬁnitions of a ﬂux control coefﬁcient now allow a
precise statement of the circumstances in which an enzyme
could be said to catalyze the rate-limiting step of a pathway.
Such a description would be reasonable if any variation in the
activity of the enzyme produced a proportional variation in
the ﬂux through the pathway, and in terms of equations 13.9–
13.10 this would mean that such an enzyme had CJ
i
= 1.
For example, if increasing the activity of phosphofructokinase
twofold in a living cell caused a twofold increase in the gly-
colytic ﬂux then phosphofructokinase would have CJ
i = 1 and
one could call it the rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis. In
fact, however, Heinisch and co-workers found that increasing

the activity of phosphofructokinase 3.5-fold in fermenting
yeast had no detectable effect on the ﬂux to ethanol. Similar
experiments have subsequently been carried with other sup-
posedly rate-limiting enzymes, with similar results, and there
are theoretical reasons for expecting it to be very rare for any
enzyme to have complete ﬂux control (Section 13.5.1).

tion of various steps to the con-
trol of mitochondrial respira-
tion” Journal of Biological
Chemistry 257, 2754–2757
an enzyme in a system without perturbing anything else is
to vary its concentration e0, and so the most obvious in-
terpretation of the perturbing parameter u that appeared in
equations 13.9 and 13.11 is that it is identical to e0. This may
seem to be just one of many possibilities, but in practice it is
virtually the only one, because most inhibitors and activators
change not only the activity of an enzyme but also its sensi-
tivity to its substrates and products: thus they alter not only
the apparent limiting rate of an enzyme but also its Michaelis
constants, as extensively discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. Pure
Chapters 6–7, pages 133–188
noncompetitive inhibitors would be the exception, but, as
discussed in those chapters, these are not available for almost
any enzyme, apart from highly unspeciﬁc effectors such as
protons that would not fulﬁll the required role of perturbing
just one enzyme activity.
Finding a pure noncompetitive
inhibitor for just one enzyme in a system would be difﬁcult
enough; ﬁnding a whole series to allow perturbation of any
enzyme at will is likely to be a fantasy for the foreseeable
future. In practice, therefore, identifying the parameter u with
the enzyme concentration corresponds closely with experi-
mental reality, and varying enzyme concentrations by genetic
or other means remains the only practical way of perturbing
one enzyme activity at a time.
None of this means that ordinary inhibitors and activators
cannot be used to probe the control structure of a pathway.
On the contrary, Groen and co-workers used them very effec-
tively for this purpose in a pioneering study of mitochondrial
respiration, but the analysis was more complicated than sim-
ply treating each inhibitor titration as a perturbation of the
activity of one enzyme.

The simplest case to consider (and the only one usually con-

for the activities of other enzymes in the system. We shall
discuss this ﬁrst, examining more realistic assumptions in

(f) As a result, the substrate has

(g) there is increased product
inhibition. The ﬁnal ﬂux is not
very different from what it was
at the beginning, but the meta-
bolite concentrations are noti-
ceably changed. In reality all
these effects are simultaneous.
The fundamental properties of the control coefﬁcients are
expressed by two summation relationships, of which the ﬁrst,
due to Kacser and Burns, deﬁnes the sum of ﬂux control
coefﬁcients:
n
∑
i=1
CJ
i = 1
(13.12)
and the second, due to Heinrich and Rapoport, deﬁnes the
sum of concentration control coefﬁcients:
n
∑
i=1
C
sj
i = 0
(13.13)
in which n is the number of enzymes in the system, and sj is
the concentration of any internal metabolite. If the pathway
is branched there will be more than one ﬂux: equation 13.12
then holds with J deﬁned as any of these. The validity of
these relationships may not be immediately obvious, but by
following the argument in Figure 13.13 it is easy to see why
ﬂux control coefﬁcients are normally small, whereas concen-
tration control coefﬁcients need not be small.
Various proofs exist, of which Reder’s is probably the most
rigorous and general. However, as it assumes a knowledge of
matrix algebra, I shall not give it here, preferring the original
“thought experiments” of Kacser and Burns, which are easier
to understand. Suppose we make small changes dei in all
enzyme concentrations in any system in which the reaction
rates are all proportional to the concentrations of the enzymes
that catalyze them.
The total effect on any ﬂux J may be

As we have assumed nothing about the magnitudes of the
changes dei apart from saying that they are small, we can
give them any small values we like, so let us assume that
each enzyme concentration changes in the same proportion,
so that each dei has the same value . A moment’s reﬂection6

should show that such a change is equivalent to changing
the time scale of the measurements: thus it should change all
steady-state ﬂuxes through the system by exactly a factor of
. It follows therefore that equation 13.15 can be written as
follows:
 ? CJ
1 , CJ
2 , CJ
3 , . . .
Then each term can be divided by  to give a result equivalent
to equation 13.12

Applying the same logic to the concentration control coef-
ﬁcients, the only difference is that changing the time scale
should leave all concentrations unchanged, and putting a zero
on the left-hand side7 gives the equivalent to equation 13.13:
0 ? C

The essence of equation 13.12 is that the control of ﬂux
through a pathway is shared by all the enzymes in the system,
which need not contain any step catalyzed by an enzyme
whose properties determine the kinetic behavior of the whole
system, that is to say a rate-limiting enzyme as deﬁned in
Section 13.4.1. If all ﬂux control coefﬁcients are positive, the
§13.4.1, pages 341–344
6Not everyone agrees that a moment’s reﬂection is enough. Consider a
series of  identical tanks separated from one another by a series of partitions.
If just one of them is being ﬁlled with water at a rate J and its outlet is left
open, it will ﬁll to the point where the pressure is sufﬁcient for the water to
ﬂow out at the same rate J. If the same is done with all  tanks they will
ﬁll to the same level, and the total ﬂow rate will be J. As the pressures are
equal on the two sides of every partition they are not necessary and can be
13.5 Properties of control coefﬁcients
347
idea of sharing control is completely straightforward: no en-
zyme can have a control coefﬁcient greater than 1, and if any
enzyme has one approaching 1 those of the others must be
correspondingly small. Although ﬂux control coefﬁcients are
normally positive in unbranched pathways, exceptions can
occur if substrate inhibition or product activation dominate
the behavior of some enzymes. With branched pathways the
idea of sharing is less clear, because ﬂux control coefﬁcients
are then often negative and they may also be greater than 1.
However, one often (though not universally) ﬁnds that the
following generalizations apply: any enzyme has a positive
ﬂux control coefﬁcient for the ﬂux through its own reaction;
numerically signiﬁcant negative ﬂux control coefﬁcients are
not common, occurring mainly for enzymes and ﬂuxes that
occur in different branches immediately after a branch point.

If the curve is a rectangular
hyperbola then changes in 1/J
are proportional to changes in
1/e.
The previous section considered effects of inﬁnitesimal
changes in enzyme activity, but in practice we often want
to know what sort of changes in ﬂux and metabolite con-
centrations to expect in response to large changes. For ex-
ample, if an enzyme Ei has a ﬂux control coefﬁcient of 0.2
at some concentration ei, can one assume that the ﬂux will
be proportional to e0.2
i
if ei is changed by a large amount?
In fact one cannot assume this, because ﬂux control coefﬁ-
cients (and any other control coefﬁcients) are not constants
but vary when the conditions vary. If an enzyme activity is
lowered sufﬁciently it must be possible to arrive at a condi-
tion where the ﬂux is proportional to that activity (assuming
that no isoenzyme catalyzing the same step is present), so in
the absence of isoenzymes any ﬂux control coefﬁcient must
approach 1 at very low activity.
More generally, a plot of
ﬂux against enzyme activity typically resembles a Michaelis–
Menten hyperbola (though it does not accurately follow such
a curve except under rather unrealistic assumptions), with a
limiting slope of 1 at ei = 0, approaching a slope of 0 when ei
is large, as illustrated in Figure 13.17. If the curve in Figure
13.17 were accurately a rectangular hyperbola through the
origin, the reciprocal ﬂux 1/J would be a linear function of
any reciprocal enzyme activity 1/e and one could calculate
removed, to give a single tank of size α times the size of one of them. The
large tank will then have ﬂow rate of αJ. See Figures 13.14–16.
7Remember the tanks of water: multiplying the number of tanks by α has
no effect on the level at steady state.

is useful for getting a rough indication of the effect of a given
perturbation when the effect of another such perturbation has
been measured, but it should be applied cautiously: not only
is the curve not strictly a rectangular hyperbola, but, even if it
were, accurate values of the parameters could not be obtained
from measurements in just two conditions.

Small and Kacser extended this approach, and showed
that measurement of the ﬂux at just one value of ei is sufﬁcient
if the ﬂux control coefﬁcient CJ at that value is known, again
with the proviso that the dependence is treated as hyperbolic:
J = Jlimitei
e0.5 + ei
in which Jlimit is the limiting ﬂux that cannot be exceeded and
e0.5 is the value of ei at which J = 0.5Jlimit. This is obviously
just the Michaelis–Menten equation in different symbols. Dif-
ferentiation with respect to ei gives
CJ = ei
J · dJ

=
e0.5
e0.5 + ei

So, for example, if CJ = 0.2 for an enzyme in the wild type of
a bacterial culture the increase in ﬂux that could be expected
by overexpressing it by a factor of ten would be about 20%.
Estimating effects of large perturbations is, of course, crucial
for biotechnology, for which inﬁnitesimal changes have no
interest, and we return to the topic in Section 13.11.
§13.11, pages 373–377
Apart from the trivial fact that the curve in Figure 13.17
is not accurately a rectangular hyperbola, there is another
much more important difference between the dependence of
metabolic ﬂux on enzyme activity and the dependence of
initial rate on substrate concentration for Michaelis–Menten
kinetics.
With simple enzyme kinetics it is very difﬁcult
to saturate an enzyme, or even to approach saturation, as
discussed in Section 2.3.4, but typical enzyme activities are
§2.3.4, pages 35–37
high enough that increasing them has a negligible effect on

the ﬂux. This follows from the summation relationship: if
typical ﬂux control coefﬁcients are very small, then typical
enzyme activities must be on the ﬂat part of the curve. This
has two very important consequences. First of all it implies
that increasing an enzyme activity artiﬁcially, for example
by genetic manipulation, will usually have no perceptible
effect on the ﬂux through that enzyme. This immediately ex-
plains why overexpressing phosphofructokinase in ferment-
ing yeast (Section 13.4.1) had no measurable effect on ethanol
§13.4.1, pages 341–344
production, and it predicts that any attempt to force more
ﬂux through a pathway by overexpressing a supposedly rate-
limiting enzyme is likely to be doomed to failure.
The second point is that the curve in Figure 13.17 ex-
plains why most genes in diploid organisms are observed
to be recessive: the 50% dose of a gene in a heterozygote
typically results in a phenotype indistinguishable from that
of a normal homozygote, whereas the 0% dose in the corre-
sponding abnormal homozygote results in a clearly different
phenotype.
For many years this observation, repeated in
many diploid organisms,8 was regarded as mysterious, and
Fisher’s very obscure and difﬁcult-to-understand explanation
in terms of “modiﬁer genes” was generally accepted by ge-
R. A. Fisher (1928) “The
possible modiﬁcation of the
response of the wild type to
recurrent mutations” American
Naturalist 62, 115–126
neticists.
However Kacser and Burns pointed out that the
H. Kacser J. A. Burns (1981)
“The molecular basis of
dominance ” Genetics 97,
639–666
curve in Figure 13.17 means that an obscure explanation is
not needed: the typical effect of decreasing an enzyme to 50%
of the physiological activity will be very small and perhaps
undetectable, whereas the typical effect of decreasing it to 0%
will be obvious.
13.5.3
Constrained enzyme concentrations
To this point we have been implicitly assuming that the con-
centration of an enzyme can be increased indeﬁnitely without
affecting the concentrations of the other enzymes in the sys-
tem. Lion and co-workers have pointed out that this is not

realistic, because a cell has limited resources (including space)
for production of enzymes and other proteins. They investi-
gated the effects of changing the concentrations of individual
enzymes with the constraint that the total concentration of
8Humans appear to have a higher proportion of dominant genes than
other species. The most likely explanation is that small changes in the human
are considered phenotypic whereas in other organisms they would pass
unnoticed. See A. Cornish-Bowden and V. Nanjundiah (2006) “The basis of
dominance”, pages 1–16 in The Biology of Genetic Dominance, edited by R. A.

13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
all enzymes remains constant. It is intuitively obvious that
if one activity increases with this constraint the average of
the others must decrease, with a negative effect on the ﬂux
through the pathway, and that is what was found. Although

small increases in one concentration have negligible effects
on the others, eventually the decreases in other activities
must produce a decrease in ﬂux, so, instead of resembling
a Michaelis–Menten hyperbola, the ﬂux as a function of one
enzyme activity must pass through a maximum, as illustrated
in Figure 13.19.
This analysis is probably important for studying evolu-
tionary constraints on enzyme activity, because it means that
optimizing metabolism must be constrained, and that enzyme
concentrations cannot simply increase without limit. From
the practical point of view it is probably less important, be-
cause few enzymes are present at such high physiological
concentrations that increasing them would produce a percep-
tible effect on others.
There are exceptions, however: just
one enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, accounts for
about half of all the protein in the leaves of green plants, so
increasing its concentration would almost inevitably produce
a decrease in photosynthetic ﬂux.

Relationships between elasticities and
control coefﬁcients
13.6.1
Connectivity properties
For an unbranched pathway of n enzymes there is one sum-
mation relationship for ﬂux control coefﬁcients, and n −1
summation relationships between concentration control coef-
ﬁcients, but there are n ﬂux control coefﬁcients and n(n −1)
concentration control coefﬁcients, or n2 control coefﬁcients
altogether. In effect, therefore, the summation relationships
provide n equations relating n2 unknowns. To calculate all
of the unknowns, a further n(n −1) equations are needed.
These come from the connectivity properties, which will now
be described.
If the concentration ei of an isolated enzyme changes by
dei and the concentration sj of a metabolite changes simulta-
neously dsj (any other metabolite concentrations that affect
the enzyme being left unchanged), the net effect is as follows:
dvi
vi
= dei
ei
+ ε
vj
sj
dsj
sj
13.6 Elasticities and control coefﬁcients
351
In general the effect on the ﬂux J will be different when
the same changes are made in a complete system, because
other rates and concentrations will change at the same time.
Suppose, however, that dei and dsj are chosen so as to give a
net effect of zero:
dvi
vi

+ ε
vj
sj
dsj
sj
= 0
and so
dei

(13.16)
A corresponding equation can be written for each value of
i, so we can readily calculate the small changes that have
to be made to all the enzyme concentrations in a complete
system to produce a particular change dsj in the jth metabolite
concentration, leaving all other metabolite concentrations and
all rates (and hence all ﬂuxes) unchanged.
If there is no
change in ﬂux for a particular series of enzyme perturbations,
equation 13.15 may be written as follows:
0 = CJ
1
de1
e1
+ CJ
2
de2
e2
+ CJ
3
de3

(13.17)
and by substituting equation 13.16 for each value of i into this
it becomes
−dsj

CJ

3εv3
sj + · · · = 0
(13.18)
This now expresses the connectivity property between ﬂux
control coefﬁcients and elasticities, which was discovered by
Kacser and Burns. In a real pathway some of the elasticities
will normally be zero, as it is unlikely that every metabolite
has a signiﬁcant effect on every enzyme. Consequently some
of the terms in sums such as that in equation 13.18 will usually
be missing, but in this section I shall include all the terms that
could in principle occur.
As no metabolite concentration except sj has been changed,
an equation similar to equation 13.17 applies to any metabo-
lite Sk for which k ̸= j:
0 = Csk

and, substituting equation 13.16 as before, these lead to the
connectivity properties between concentration control coefﬁ-
cients and elasticities derived by Westerhoff and Chen:

For an unbranched pathway of n enzymes there are n −1
equations similar to equation 13.18, one for each metabolite,
and (n −1)2 equations similar to equation 13.19, one for each
combination of two metabolites, and together these provide
the n(n −1) additional equations that must be combined with
the n summation relationships to provide the n2 equations
needed to calculate all the control coefﬁcients from the elas-
ticities.

Although complications arise with branched pathways, these
do not alter the essential point that a sufﬁcient number of
independent relationships between control coefﬁcients and
elasticities exist for it to be possible in principle to calculate
all of the control coefﬁcients. This not only establishes that
the steady-state properties (control coefﬁcients) of a complete
system follow from the properties of its components (elastic-
ities), but it also shows how the calculation can be done. The
actual solution of n2 simultaneous equations is complicated
if n is not trivially small, and, as Fell and Sauro explain the
problem is treated in current practice as one of matrix algebra.
I shall not enter into details here, but instead will examine the
results of such a calculation for a simple example.

The numerators are placed over the corresponding terms in
the denominators to emphasize that not only is the denomina-
tor the same in the three expressions, but also that it consists
of the sum of the three numerators, in accordance with the
summation relationship, equation 13.15.
Each term in the
denominator consists of a product of elasticities, one elastic-
ity for each internal metabolite in the system; each numera-
tor consists of those denominator terms that do not contain
the activity of the enzyme whose control coefﬁcient is being
expressed; for example, equation 13.22 refers to E3, so the
numerator does not contain any elasticities with superscript
v3.
The minus signs in equations 13.20–13.22 arise naturally
from the algebra. We should not allow them to mislead us
into thinking that any of the individual terms in the equa-
tions are negative. Under “normal” conditions (deﬁned as
in Section 13.3.2 as conditions where there is no substrate
§13.3.2, pages 336–337
inhibition or product activation) the combination of positive
substrate elasticities with negative product elasticities makes
all of the terms in the three equations positive. There are cor-
responding relationships for each metabolite concentration,
for example, for s1:
Cs1
1 =
εv3
s2 −εv2
s2
εv2
s1 εv3
s2 −εv1
s1 εv3
s2 + εv1

(13.23)

s2 −εv3

s1 εv1
s2
(13.24)
Cs1
3 =
εv2
s2 −εv1
s2
εv2
s1 εv3
s2 −εv1
s1 εv3
s2 + εv1
s1 εv2
s2 −εv2
s1 εv1
s2
(13.25)
These expressions have the same denominator as those for
the ﬂux-control coefﬁcients, equations 13.20–13.22, but now
each numerator term contains one fewer elasticity than the
denominator terms, because the concentration s1 that occurs
as a superscript on the left-hand side of the equation does not
occur in the numerator elasticities. As before, the modulated
enzyme is missing from every numerator product, and one
additional enzyme is also missing from each product. Each
numerator term occurs twice in the three expressions, with
opposite signs; for example, the term εv3
s2 in equation 13.23 is
matched by the term −εv3
s2 in equation 13.24. This matching
354
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
of numerator terms ensures that the summation relationship,
equation 13.13, is obeyed.
13.6.3
Expression of summation and connectivity
relationships in matrix form
I am keeping matrix algebra to a minimum in this book,
but readers familiar with it may ﬁnd it helpful to have the
results of the previous section expressed in a way that will
facilitate comparison with review articles that use the matrix
formulation. This anyway becomes almost indispensable for
taking metabolic control analysis beyond the most elementary
level. Matrix multiplication is explained in Figures 13.21–22.

Note ﬁrst of all that the top row of the control matrix contains
the three ﬂux control coefﬁcients, and the second and third
rows contain the concentration control coefﬁcients for the two
intermediates S1 and S2 respectively.
The elasticity matrix
contains a unit vector as ﬁrst column, and the other entries
contain all of the elasticities, of which εv3
s1 is replaced by zero
because S1 is assumed in Figure 13.20 to have no effect on
E3. The product of the ﬁrst row of the control matrix and
the ﬁrst column of the elasticity matrix yields the top-left
entry in the unit matrix, which is 1, and thus expresses the
summation relationship for ﬂux control coefﬁcients (compare
equation 13.15).
In a similar way the summation relation-
ships for concentration control coefﬁcients are expressed by
products of the other rows of the control matrix with the ﬁrst
column of the elasticity matrix. The connectivity relationship
for ﬂux control coefﬁcients is expressed by the product of the
top row of the control matrix with any column of the elasticity
matrix apart from the ﬁrst. The connectivity relationships for
concentration control coefﬁcients are expressed by all of the
other possible products that have not been explicitly men-
tioned.
13.6 Elasticities and control coefﬁcients
355
13.6.4
Connectivity relationship for a metabolite not
involved in feedback
Every metabolite has at least two nonzero elasticities, because
every metabolite affects the rates of the enzyme for which it
is the substrate and the enzyme for which it is the product.
Metabolites that are not involved in feedback or feedforward
effects and are not substrates or products of more than one
enzyme will have only these two nonzero elasticities, and the
connectivity relationship then assumes rather a simple form.
For example, for S1 in Figure 13.20, we have
CJ
1εv1
s1 = −CJ
2εv2
s1
which shows that the ratio of the ﬂux control coefﬁcients of
two consecutive enzymes is equal to minus the reciprocal of
the ratio of elasticities of the connecting metabolite (hence the
name “connectivity relationship”):
CJ
1
CJ
2
= −εv2
s1

(13.27)
This relationship allows one to “walk” along a pathway re-
lating control coefﬁcients in pairs, and as control coefﬁcients
are in principle much more difﬁcult to measure directly than
elasticities, this is an important advantage.
13.6.5
The ﬂux control coefﬁcient of an enzyme for
the ﬂux through its own reaction
The increasingly algebraic expression of metabolic control
analysis, and especially the increasing use of matrix algebra,
can result in obscuring properties that are quite obvious if
one takes care not to lose sight of the underlying chemistry.
An example is provided by the degree of control exerted by
an enzyme Ei on the ﬂux through the reaction that it cat-
alyzes. If we ignore the complication of multiple enzymes
in the system that catalyze the same reaction (that is to say
we ignore the possibility of isoenzymes), then it is obvious
that the rate vi depends only on the activity of the enzyme
itself as determined by its concentration and those of its own
substrate Si−1 and product Si as sensed through their nonzero
elasticities, and those of any other metabolites (activators or
inhibitors) with nonzero elasticities, which we can represent
by an arbitrary intermediate Sk.
Thus the same kind of
356
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
thought experiment that led us to equation 13.14 will give the
following expression:
dJi = ∂vi
∂ei
dei + ∂vi
∂si−1
dsi−1 + ∂vi
∂si
dsi + ∂vi
∂sk
dsk
We can write the steady-state ﬂux Ji through the step cat-
alyzed by Ei on the left-hand side of this expression rather
than vi because in the steady state they are identical. Dividing
all terms by videi/ei (or Jidei/ei) and multiplying where ap-
propriate by fractions equivalent to unity (such as si−1/si−1),

The left-hand side of this equation is the deﬁnition of the ﬂux

is the elasticity of Ei with respect to its own rate (usually
assumed to be equal to unity), and each of the other terms
can be recognized as an elasticity multiplied by a control co-
efﬁcient. Making all the appropriate substitutions, therefore,
the equation may be written as follows:

This equation now expresses Heinrich and Rapoport’s impor-
tant ﬁnding that the ﬂux control coefﬁcient of any enzyme for
the ﬂux through its own reaction is completely determined

(1974) “A linear steady-state
theory of enzymatic chains:
general properties, control and
effector strength” European
Journal of Biochemistry 42, 89–95
by the sum of the products of its nonzero elasticities with the
corresponding concentration control coefﬁcients. Although
only three metabolites appear on the right-hand side of equa-
tion 13.28, representing the three classes of metabolites that
commonly have nonzero elasticities, for any given enzyme
the number may be more or less than three.
It will not
normally be less than two, however, because substrates and
products always have nonzero elasticities: algebraically this
must be true, and even numerically it will be unusual for a
substrate or product elasticity to be negligible.
13.7
Response coefﬁcients: the partitioned
response
Although it is sometimes convenient for the algebra to treat
changes in an enzyme activity as if they resulted from changes
13.7 Response coefﬁcients: the partitioned response

in the concentration of the enzyme, in fact the effects on the
system are exactly the same regardless of how they were
caused. The justiﬁcation for this assertion lies in the treatment
of external effectors on enzymes.
As an analog of a control coefﬁcient that expresses the
dependence of a system variable such as ﬂux on an internal
parameter such as enzyme activity, one can deﬁne a response
coefﬁcient RJ
z to express the dependence of a system variable
on an external parameter, such as the concentration z of an
external effector Z:
RJ
z = ∂ln J
∂ln z
An external effector such as Z can only produce a systemic
effect by acting on one or more enzymes in the system. So
it must have at least one nonzero elasticity9 εviz , deﬁned in
exactly the same way as any other elasticity:
εviz = ∂ln vi
∂ln z
We now consider how these two quantities are related to each
other and to the ﬂux control coefﬁcient of the enzyme acted on
by Z. Any effect of Z on the system can be counterbalanced by
changing the concentration of the enzyme by an amount just
sufﬁcient to produce a net effect of zero. So we can write a
zero change in rate as the sum of two effects that cancel one
another:
dvi
vi
= εviz
dz
z + dei
ei
= 0
and the corresponding zero change in ﬂux is also the sum of
two terms:
dJ
J = RJ

= 0
So we can write

Dividing one deﬁnition10 by the other produces the expres-
sion for the partitioned response, which shows that the response
9In older papers this type of elasticity was called a controllability coefﬁcient
or a kappa elasticity and given the symbol κ. However, this distinction is not
very useful and will not be maintained here.
10In earlier editions of this book I expressed this in terms of dividing one
zero expression by the other, but although this leads to the right result it is
not a valid procedure because 0/0 is undeﬁned.

13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
coefﬁcient is the product of the elasticity of the effector for
the enzyme that it acts on and the control coefﬁcient of that
enzyme:
RJ
z = CJ

(13.29)
Although we have considered effects on ﬂuxes here, exactly
the same relationship applies to any variable of the system,
so J in equation 13.29 can be replaced by any metabolite
concentration sj:
R

z = C

The partitioned response may seem like an obscure and
uninteresting relationship, but it is of vital importance be-
cause it provides the justiﬁcation for treating all effects of ex-
ternal inhibitors or activators as if they resulted from changes
in enzyme concentration.
Failure to appreciate this led to

er?” pages 3–11 in Control of

many criticisms of metabolic control analysis before it came
to be accepted as a valid approach. For example, Atkinson
wrote

anything has changed.
such changes appear usually to be related to the
need for enough enzyme to meet maximum
needs, and not to contribute directly to moment-
by-moment regulation of ﬂuxes.
The partitioned response embodied in equation 13.29 and
illustrated in Figure 13.23 explains why this implied criticism
is mistaken.

The partitioned response also explains the difference be-
tween the deﬁnitions of a control coefﬁcient represented by
equations 13.9 and 13.10: these are apparently equivalent
only because the deﬁnition of εv
e0 given in equations 13.4 was
assumed to be true; there is an implicit elasticity of unity
connecting the response coefﬁcient deﬁned by equation 13.29
with the control coefﬁcient deﬁned by equation 13.9. In gen-
eral, any response coefﬁcient can be written as the product of
a control coefﬁcient and an elasticity. A little thought should
show that a relationship of this general kind must obviously
apply: any effector can only act on a system variable by
altering the activity of an enzyme, and transmission of this
primary effect will be moderated according to the control
coefﬁcient of the enzyme in question. This analysis shows
that the inﬁnitesimal response of a pathway to a signal de-
pends only on the values of the elasticities with respect to

the effector, not on the mechanism by which the effector acts.
The mechanism does become relevant, however, for large
effects, and then competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors,
for example, may behave very differently (Section 13.3.4).

a decade earlier, they were absorbed into the mainstream of
thought about metabolic regulation rather slowly. Indeed, it
took almost ten years before it began to be extended to new
metabolic systems, such as respiration and gluconeogenesis,
both studied by Groen and co-workers. This slow acceptance
of metabolic control analysis by the biochemical community
is partly a consequence of a supposed disdain for the classic
work on regulation, with apparently little use for such central
concepts as feedback inhibition by end products, introduced
by Yates and Pardee, and by Umbarger, or indeed any of the
topics discussed in Chapter 12.
Chapter 12, pages 281–325
Part of the confusion has resulted from a lack of agreed
deﬁnitions for certain crucial terms.
“Control” is now ac-
cepted in the ﬁeld to have the meaning attributed to it by
Kacser and Burns, but “regulation” continues to give difﬁcul-
ties. For some, regulation is little different from control, and
Sauro for example took it to mean “some sort of response of
metabolism to a change in an external inﬂuence”; for others
it is quite different, having to do with the properties of reg-
ulatory enzymes in isolation. Hofmeyr and Cornish-Bowden
argued that its use in biochemistry ought to be brought as
close as possible to its use in everyday life. When we say
that a domestic refrigerator is well regulated, for example,
we mean that it is capable of maintaining a predetermined
internal temperature constant in the face of large variations
in heat ﬂux that result from opening the door or variations
in the external temperature. Metabolism is in almost exact
analogy to this if one considers a well-regulated system to
be one in which concentrations of internal metabolites (the
“temperature”) are maintained steady in the face of variations
in metabolic ﬂux. In economic terms, we usually regard a
well-regulated economy as one in which the supply of goods
is determined largely by the demand for them. Again, there
are obvious metabolic analogies, and we should expect a
well-regulated organism to be one in which the supply of
360
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
precursors for protein synthesis is determined by the need for
protein synthesis, and not solely by the supply of food. All
of this is more difﬁcult to achieve than it may appear, as it
is becoming increasingly clear that metabolite concentrations
respond much more readily to perturbations than ﬂuxes do;
for example, deletion of a gene from the yeast genome typi-
cally produces little or no change in growth or other metabolic
ﬂuxes, but signiﬁcant changes in metabolite concentrations
(see Cornish-Bowden and Cárdenas).

Another important term that seems to mean one thing but
actually means something else is “end product”.
It seems
obvious that the end product in a metabolic system ought
to be the sink into which the ﬂux ﬂows.
But in ordinary
use in the literature on metabolic regulation, for example in
Stadtman’s inﬂuential review, “end product” always refers
to a metabolite such as threonine that is not excreted but
is explicitly recognized as the starting point for other path-
ways.11
In virtually the entire experimental literature on
metabolic regulation an end product is understood in this
way; it never means a genuine end product of metabolism
such as water or carbon dioxide. It follows, therefore, that we
cannot hope to understand the role of end-product inhibition
in metabolic regulation unless we draw pathways as compo-
nents of systems that explicitly recognize that there are steps
after the release of “end product”. Thus in their discussion
of feedback inhibition Kacser and Burns included a step after
the formation of end product, though they did not explain
the reason for doing so. Many textbooks, however, omit this
step, and thereby rendering meaningful analysis of metabolic
regulation impossible.
As a step towards integrating the classical regulatory con-
cepts into metabolic control analysis, Hofmeyr and Cornish-
Bowden represented a pathway with feedback inhibition as
a two-step pathway, with a supply block, consisting of all the
reactions that lead to the end product, and a demand block,
consisting of the reactions that consume it. This means that
representing a biosynthetic pathway as in Figure 13.24, where
the supply block is the entire pathway, makes the end product
an external parameter and any effect that it has on the ﬂux
must be treated in terms of a response coefﬁcient RJss3 that is
conceptually the same as the block elasticity εv123
s3
that deﬁnes
11As if that were not enough, many authors have followed Stadtman in
emphasizing the idea with the term “ultimate end product”, adding redun-
dancy to error.
13.8 Control and regulation

its effect on the supply ﬂux considered as the local rate. To
get around this problem, and to understand the regulation
of such a pathway, the demand for end product must be
explicitly included in the pathway, as in Figure 13.25.
It follows from this kind of discussion that the boundaries
of a system and the distinctions between internal and external
parameters or between local and systemic properties cannot
be regarded as absolute. To understand how an end product

such as S3 in Figure 13.24 can fulﬁll its regulatory role, it
is not sufﬁcient to regard it solely as an internal metabolite;
we must also study subsystems where it becomes an external
parameter, so that we can ask questions like “if the supply
block in Figure 13.25 were the complete system, what effect
would s3 have on the supply ﬂux?”.
Using this type of analysis, one can study how to achieve
effective regulation of a pathway such as that of Figure 13.25
by demand, by which we mean not only that the ﬂux re-
sponds sensitively to changes in demand, but also that the
concentration of end product changes little when the ﬂux
changes. Control of ﬂux by demand requires the supply elas-
ticity, εv123
s3 , in the complete system (the same as the response
coefﬁcient RJss3 in the supply block considered in isolation)
must be as large as possible compared with the demand elas-
ticity εv4
s3. (Being an inhibitory elasticity the supply elasticity
is negative, so “as large as possible” means “as far below
zero as possible”.) Effective homeostasis of S3 requires the
absolute sum (ignoring minus signs) of the two elasticities to
be as large as possible. Both criteria thus favor making the
supply elasticity large, but they pull in opposite directions for
the demand elasticity, so some compromises are inevitable.
The results of a study by Hofmeyr and Cornish-Bowden of
the importance of cooperativity in effective regulation proved
to be surprising, as they appeared at ﬁrst to suggest that it
was much less important than had been thought since the
1960s. However, it must be emphasized that this is an illusion:
cooperativity is certainly as necessary for effective regulation
as has been thought, but its role is somewhat different from
what one might naively imagine.
Changing the degree of cooperativity in the feedback in-
hibition of E1 by S3 in Figure 13.25 in the range of Hill coefﬁ-
cients from 1 (no cooperativity) to 4 (approximately the max-
imum cooperativity observed in any single effector–enzyme
interaction) has almost no effect on the control of ﬂux by
demand: the curves showing ﬂux as a function of demand
362
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
(expressed by the limiting rate V4 of the demand block) show
near-proportionality between ﬂux and demand over a 25-fold
range, regardless of the Hill coefﬁcient. This must surprise
anyone who thinks that cooperativity is essential for ﬂux
regulation. However, as has been emphasized already, ﬂux
regulation is only part of regulation, and it is of little use
without concentration regulation: we should not be satisﬁed
with a refrigerator that tolerated a wide range of heat ﬂuxes
but had no control over the internal temperature! When the
concentration of end product is considered as well as the ﬂux,
the effect of the Hill coefﬁcient becomes large: over the same
25-fold range of demand considered above, a Hill coefﬁcient
of 4 causes s3 to be restricted to less than a threefold range,
whereas with a Hill coefﬁcient of 1 it varies more than tenfold
in a demand range of only about threefold. Results from a
later study are shown in Figures 13.26–27.
In summary, cooperativity of feedback interactions is in-
deed essential for effective regulation, but it is not sufﬁcient to
say that it allows effective regulation of ﬂux by demand;12 one
must say that it allows effective regulation of ﬂux by demand
while maintaining homeostasis.

Mechanisms of regulation
To a considerable extent metabolic control analysis takes the
properties of individual enzymes as it ﬁnds them, regarding
a mechanistic explanation of these properties as outside its
domain. Moreover, we have already discussed the principal
of such mechanisms in Chapter 12 of this book, and there
Chapter 12, pages 281–325
is no need to discuss them again here. In addition to these,
however, there are also three important regulatory mecha-
nisms that involve multiple enzymes, which demand fuller
discussion: these are channeling of intermediates between
enzymes, interconvertible enzyme cascades involving cova-
lent modiﬁcation, and the ampliﬁcation of the effects of small
changes in ATP concentration by adenylate kinase.
13.9.1
Metabolite channeling
Channeling involves the idea that the metabolite shared by
two consecutive enzymes in a pathway may be directly trans-
ferred from one to the other, without being released into free
12More exactly, it allows a small ratio of demand to supply elasticities,
which is the essential property for effective control of ﬂux by demand.

solution, or at least without achieving equilibrium with the
metabolite in free solution.
The principle of metabolite channeling may be illustrated
by reference to the simple two-enzyme pathway illustrated
in Figure 13.28. In this ﬁgure the pathway is shown in the
conventional way as a pair of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
However, in channeling the enzymes must be treated not sim-
ply as catalysts, but as chemical reactants, so it is convenient
to redraw this ﬁgure as a set of cycles, as in Figure 13.29. Then

channeling of the intermediate metabolite S2 can be added in
the form of a new intermediate E1E2S2 that can be formed
if E1S2 encounters E2 before S2 is released (Figure 13.30). S2
is then said to be channeled from one enzyme to the other.
If one goes one step further, and supposes that S2 is never
released into free solution at all (Figure 13.31), so that only the
direct transfer is possible, one has perfect channeling. Both of
these are examples of dynamic channeling, and below we shall
discuss what this means and contrast it with static channeling.

There is at least one enzyme, the multifunctional enzyme
tryptophan synthase, for which the evidence for channeling
(of indole13) is overwhelming and generally accepted (see
Yanofsky), but in general the reality of channeling remains
controversial, and the enzymes malate dehydrogenase and
citrate synthase illustrate the sort of difﬁculties that can arise
when trying to establish whether it actually occurs.
Lind-
bladh and co-workers made a “fusion protein” of these en-
zymes from yeast, using genetic techniques to produce a
single protein containing both activities, and Shatalin and co-
workers made a similar fusion protein for the same pair of
enzymes from pigs. In both studies the transient lag time for
product formation was shorter for the fusion protein than it
was for the free enzymes, suggesting that the intermediate
oxaloacetate was channeled between the active sites.
This
conclusion needs an assumption that the individual enzymes
have exactly the same kinetic properties when fused as they
have when free. However, when this was carefully checked
for the fusion protein of the yeast enzymes, the kinetic param-
eters were found to differ from those of the free enzymes to a
sufﬁcient degree to account for the decreased lag time (Pet-
tersson and co-workers), without requiring any channeling.
13Knowles pointed out that we should not be surprised to ﬁnd indole
treated differently from other metabolites, because it must be prevented from
escaping across membranes: “one of the very few neutral molecules found
in primary metabolism is indole, and for this intermediate the evidence for
channeling is compelling: logically, kinetically, and structurally.”
364
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
Why should the reality of channeling be uncontroversial
for tryptophan synthase but not for most other examples?
There is, in fact, an important conceptual difference that has
implications for the plausibility of a channeling mechanism:
tryptophan synthetase is a single protein that catalyzes two
distinct reactions, whereas in Figures 13.30–31 E1 and E2
are assumed to be two separate proteins that meet for the
transfer of intermediate but are otherwise independent. This
makes an important difference, because in these models we
assume that encounter between two macromolecules occurs
with about the same or higher probability than encounter be-
tween a macromolecule and a small molecule, which conﬂicts
with the usual behavior of diffusing molecules in solution, as
discussed by Cárdenas. Channeling in tryptophan synthetase
is thus an example of static channeling and is better repre-
sented by the mechanism shown in Figure 13.32.

The controversy about whether channeling actually occurs
in the systems where it is proposed is certainly important
in relation to metabolic control, because if it does not occur
it cannot have any relevance to control.
Nonetheless, this
is only part of the question, because it does not necessarily
follow that channeling has any signiﬁcant metabolic conse-
quences even if it does occur.
This point has been much

less discussed, possibly because the advantages of channeling
have been perceived to be obvious, as a result of confusion
between the properties of a perfect channel with those of the
sort of dynamic channeling mechanism that is the subject of
the controversy.
It might seem intuitively obvious that in a mechanism for
dynamic channeling as in Figure 13.30 increasing the rates of
the channeling steps at the expense of the free-diffusion steps
must decrease the steady-state concentration of free interme-
diate, but this is an illusion. Although this may well decrease
the rate at which S2 is released from E1S2, it will also decrease
the rate at which S2 is taken up by E2, and the net result may
be in either direction. Whether there is a small net effect or
not is ultimately a question of deﬁnition, as it is not easy to
separate genuine effects of channeling from effects that could
equally well arise from changes in the catalytic activity of the
enzyme that have nothing to do with channeling; however,
Cornish-Bowden and Cárdenas argued that even if an effect
of channeling on intermediate concentrations exists in the
steady state it is too small to fulﬁll a useful regulatory role.
For this reason there is no necessity to consider it further in
the context of this chapter.

Interconvertible enzyme cascades
Cooperativity of interactions with individual enzymes, illus-
trated in Figure 13.33 in a way that will facilitate comparison
with the type of system to be discussed in this section, is an
important mechanism for making feedback inhibition effec-
tive as a regulatory mechanism. It has a serious drawback,
however, that prevents it from providing a universal way of
increasing elasticities: the degree of cooperativity is limited
in practice by the rarity of enzymes with Hill coefﬁcients
greater than 4; as the elasticity for an interaction cannot ex-

Much higher effective elasticities are possible with mul-

sometimes called “cascades”. Such systems have been known
for more than thirty years, and many examples are known,
many of which involve protein kinases and phosphatases, as

Escherichia coli is inactivated by adenylylation and reactivated
by deadenylylation; it has been studied in detail and has
served as the basis for extensive theoretical work by Stadtman
and co-workers.
In the context of this chapter, the essential point is that
interconvertible enzyme systems can generate high sensitivity
to signals, much higher than is possible for single enzymes, as
shown by Goldbeter and Koshland. It is tempting to suppose
that this high sensitivity is inherent in the structure of the
cycle, but in reality if the kinetic parameters of the cycle
reactions are assigned arbitrary values, the typical result is
a system that generates less sensitivity than a single nonco-
operative enzyme. Cárdenas and Cornish-Bowden showed
that very high sensitivity results only if several conditions are
satisﬁed: the interactions of the effector with the modiﬁer en-
zymes should be predominantly catalytic rather than speciﬁc
(uncompetitive rather than competitive in the terminology
of inhibition); the inactivation reaction should be switched
off at much lower concentrations of effector than are needed
to switch on the activating reaction; both modiﬁer enzymes
should operate close to saturation, a condition especially
emphasized by Goldbeter and Koshland under the name of
366
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
zero-order ultrasensitivity.14 If all these conditions are satisﬁed
the sensitivity possible with the mechanism of Figure 13.34
is enormously greater than is possible for a single enzyme;
even with severe constraints on the values allowed for the
kinetic parameters of the modiﬁer enzymes one can easily
obtain the equivalent of a Hill coefﬁcient of 30, or even of
800 if one relaxes the constraints while still staying within the
range of behavior commonly observed with real enzymes (see
Cárdenas and Cornish-Bowden).

should take special care to note what might appear to be
insigniﬁcant kinetic properties of modiﬁer enzymes. Even if
the uncompetitive component of the inhibition of a modiﬁer
enzyme is an order of magnitude weaker than the competitive
component it may still be essential to the effective working of
the system. Likewise, if one observes that the phosphatase in
a cycle is activated only at supposedly unphysiological con-
centrations of an effector ten times higher than those effective
for inhibiting the kinase, this does not mean that the effector
is irrelevant to the action of the phosphatase; it means that the
whole system is well designed for generating high sensitivity.
As interconvertible enzyme systems can generate so much
more sensitivity than individual cooperative enzymes one
may wonder why they are not universally used in metabolic
regulation. However, unlike individual cooperative enzymes
interconvertible enzyme systems consume energy, because
both modiﬁcation reactions are assumed to be irreversible;
this is possible only if they involve different co-substrates,
for example the activation might be phosphorylation by ATP
whereas the inactivation might be hydrolysis.

The metabolic role of adenylate kinase
The third mechanism that I shall consider here is rarely dis-
cussed in the context of metabolic control analysis, possibly

genesis” Proceedings of the Royal
Society, Series B 159, 545–564
because its existence has been known for so long (ﬁrst sug-
gested by Krebs) that it has been forgotten that it is a multien-
zyme regulation mechanism at all. This concerns the enzyme
adenylate kinase (often called myokinase) which catalyzes the
14This term has been widely misunderstood: by ultrasensitive Goldbeter
and Koshland meant “more sensitive than an enzyme obeying the Michaelis–
Menten equation”, so an enzyme with a Hill coefﬁcient of 1.5 is ultrasensitive
by their deﬁnition. Most authors have taken the term to imply a very high
degree of sensitivity, approaching zero-order ultrasensitivity.
13.9 Mechanisms of regulation

interconversion of the three adenine nucleotides:
ATP + AMP = 2ADP
Adenylate kinase is present with high catalytic activity in
some tissues (such as muscle) where at ﬁrst sight its reaction
appears to have no metabolic function; certainly in many cells
where the enzyme is found the long-term ﬂux through the
reaction is negligibly small. Why then is it present, and why
at such high activity? It is hardly sufﬁcient to say just that
its role is to maintain the reaction at equilibrium, because
the concentrations of ATP and ADP normally change so little
that the reaction would hardly ever be far from equilibrium
even if the enzyme concentration were much lower than it is.
The answer appears to be that if the adenine nucleotides exist
predominantly as ATP (as they do), and if the adenylate ki-
nase reaction is always at equilibrium, not just approximately
but exactly, then small changes in the balance between ATP
and ADP will be translated into large relative changes in the
concentration of AMP, so that enzymes that are speciﬁcally
affected by AMP can respond with high sensitivity to the
original small changes.

the AMP concentration is about

This idea is illustrated in Figure 13.35, which shows that
if the three adenine nucleotides are maintained at a total
concentration [ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP] = 5 mM with an equi-
librium constant of [ATP][AMP]/[ADP]2 = 0.5, then concen-
trations of ATP around 4 mM correspond to such low concen-
trations of AMP that almost all of any variation in the ATP
concentration is translated into an opposite and almost equal
variation in the ADP concentration. At ﬁrst sight it seems

scarcely any different from what one would have if the AMP
were not there. However, although its concentration in these
conditions is small, its fractional variations are large compared
with those of ATP and ADP (Figure 13.36). Any enzyme that
binds AMP tightly (so that it can detect it even though its
concentration is small compared with those of ATP and ADP)
can respond sensitively, as illustrated in Figure 13.37. The
small negative rate at very low ATP concentrations visible
in this ﬁgure has no regulatory signiﬁcance: it is due to the
reverse reaction, which occurs when the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio is
sufﬁciently small.
The presence of a high activity of adenylate kinase in a
cell thus allows AMP to act as an ampliﬁer15 of small signals:
15The mnemonic is a happy accident: AMP was given its symbol long
before its role as an ampliﬁer was recognized.

13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
in the example of Figure 13.37, 5% variation in the ATP con-
centration produces only a 2.8% change in rate if the enzyme
does not respond to AMP, but a 20% change in rate if it does;
in effect, the mechanism has increased the effective elasticity
with respect to ATP by a factor of more than seven, from about
0.56 (2.8/5) to about 4 (20/5). By itself this effect is not enough
to explain, for example, the observation that glycolytic ﬂux
in insect ﬂight muscles may increase 100-fold when the ATP
concentration falls by 10% with a simultaneous 2.5-fold in-
crease in AMP concentration, as reported by Sacktor and co-
workers, but it certainly makes a major contribution to the

do so cooperatively, whereas for calculating Figure 13.37 only
linear competitive inhibition was assumed, to avoid com-
plicating the discussion by examining two different sorts of
effect at the same time.

Computer modeling of metabolic systems
13.10.1
General considerations
We have been mainly concerned in this chapter with the
principles that govern the behavior of multienzyme systems,
and those, indeed, have been the main concerns of metabolic
control analysis in general.
Nonetheless, it is difﬁcult to
visualize the properties of systems of more than trivial size,
and although Hofmeyr has described a method that fulﬁlls
in multienzyme systems the role of the King–Altman method
in one-enzyme kinetics, it requires considerable study before
one can arrive at the sort of intuitive understanding that the
King–Altman method provides quite easily (see Section 5.7).
In addition, experiments have always been an essential aid
in efforts to understand enzyme behavior, but nontrivial mul-
tienzyme experimentation is a formidable task, often virtually
impossible.
13.10.2
Programs for modeling
For both of the reasons just mentioned, the capacity to model
multienzyme systems in the computer has been an important
tool for supplementing theoretical analysis. At a time when
as much as 30 minutes of central-processor time were needed
to simulate 75 ms of glycolysis, high-level programming lan-
guages barely existed, and programming involved great effort
to circumvent arbitrary restrictions like the inability of the
13.10 Computer modeling of metabolic systems
369
computer to represent numbers greater than one, Garﬁnkel
and Hess nonetheless succeeded in setting up a working
model of glycolysis. This has been followed by many others,
§5.7, pages 122–126
and it is now hardly necessary for the prospective simulator to
be a programmer, as various programs designed for metabolic
modeling are readily available (Mendes; Sauro; Oliveira and
co-workers; Voit and Ferreira),16 and more general mathe-
matical programs can be used for the same purpose, as thor-
oughly discussed by Mulquiney and Kuchel.
The Systems
Biology Mark-up Language (SBML) deﬁned by Hucka and co-
workers has now made it much easier than it once was for the
different programs to read the same data ﬁles.
Nonetheless, even with the use of such programs the re-
searcher needs to pay some attention to general principles
that apply to the rate equations that it is appropriate to use.

is usually possible to set up conditions that avoid the need
to consider product inhibition or reversibility, models for
multienzyme systems must always take account of effects
of products, because there is no way to ensure that product
concentrations are zero in the conditions of interest. It will
usually also be necessary to take account of effects of other
metabolites that are present in the system even though they
are not the substrates or products of the enzyme for which a
rate equation is to be written. It follows from all this that the
rate equations needed for models are almost inevitably more
complicated than those used for studying the same enzymes
one at a time. In particular, most rate equations need to be
entered in their full reversible forms. For a simple enzyme,
therefore, the fundamental equation is not equation 2.12, the
Michaelis–Menten equation, but equation 2.29, the reversible
Michaelis–Menten equation. For enzymes with complicated
kinetic behavior this immediately raises a problem, as equa-
tions of the sort introduced in Chapter 12 are almost never

irreversible forms they are not only complicated but also in-

13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
13.10.3
The reversible Hill equation
The problem of having too many parameters is fairly easily
resolved, because the difﬁculty of distinguishing experimen-
tally between models of cooperativity becomes a virtue in the
context of metabolic modeling: if one cannot easily identify
the correct equation to describe an enzyme’s behavior it will
not make a large difference to the behavior of a metabolic
model if one uses the wrong one.
In particular, the Hill
equation (equation 12.1, repeated in the margin) can usually
v =
Vah
Kh
0.5 + ah
(12.1)
describe the behavior of an enzyme in the range of interest
just as accurately as kinetic versions of equation 12.21 or 12.26,
and is thus often used for cooperative enzymes in metabolic
models. However, this leaves the other difﬁculty, that none of
these equations is ever never normally written as a reversible
equation, though in some contexts at least one needs to al-
low for reversibility in a reaction catalyzed by a cooperative
enzyme.
J.-H. S. Hofmeyr and A.
Cornish-Bowden (1997) “The
reversible Hill equation: how to
incorporate cooperative en-
zymes into metabolic models”
Computer Applications in the
Biosciences 13, 377–385
There is a need, therefore, for an empirical equation that
satisﬁes the following properties: it must always deﬁne a
rate in the direction dictated by the thermodynamic state, it
should degenerate to the appropriate irreversible Hill equa-
tion when either substrate or product concentration is zero,
and with Hill coefﬁcient h equal to the number of interacting
sites it should lead to the correct equation for maximum
cooperativity for that number of sites.
The ﬁrst of these
conditions means that it must be possible to express the rate
as a thermodynamic term, positive or negative according to
the direction the reaction needs to take to reach equilibrium,
multiplied by a positive kinetic term:
v =

1 −Γ
K

Pos(a, p, . . . )
(13.30)
In this equation K is the equilibrium constant, and is the
value at equilibrium of the mass-action ratio Γ = p/a, and
Pos(a, p, . . . ) is any positive function of a, p and any other
relevant concentrations. Although we have not previously
needed this equation in this book, all of the reversible equa-
tions that have appeared can be written in the same form.
v =
kAe0a −kPe0p
1 +
a
KmA
+
p
KmP
(2.29)
For example, equation 2.29 (repeated in the margin) can be
written as follows:

kA/kP

· kAe0a
1 +

which takes the form of equation 13.30 if we put
Γ = p

; Pos(a, p, . . . ) =
kAe0a
1 +
a
KmA

Returning to the Hill equation, Hofmeyr and Cornish-
Bowden proposed a reversible form that satisﬁes the require-
ments, as follows:

in which V is the limiting rate of the forward reaction, a0.5
is the substrate concentration that gives a rate of 0.5V in the
absence of product, p0.5 is the corresponding parameter for
the reverse reaction, K is the equilibrium constant and h is the
Hill coefﬁcient.

This equation can readily be generalized to accommodate
modiﬁers. For example, if it is written as follows:

h
then x represents the concentration of a substance that can
act either as an inhibitor or as an activator, depending on the
value of β: if β < 1 then it is an inhibitor, and if β > 1 it is an
activator.
These equations are far simpler than anyone could hope to
derive from mechanistically realistic models of cooperativity,
but they may still be more complicated than one might wish
when modeling, and they contain parameters that may not
be experimentally known, such as p0.5. We need, therefore, to
return to the general question of when it is safe to represent re-
actions in metabolic models with irreversible equations. Pre-
vious discussions (for example that of Hofmeyr and Cornish-
Bowden) have tended to recommend that only an exit reaction
into a metabolic sink should be treated as irreversible, and
not all authors (for example Mendes and co-workers) would
allow even this exception. On the other hand most published
models (for example those of Heinrich and Rapoport, and
372
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
of Bakker and co-workers) have in practice treated reactions
with large equilibrium constants, such as that catalyzed by
pyruvate kinase, as irreversible. It thus appeared surprising
that a slight modiﬁcation that Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden
made to the model of Bakker and co-workers to allow for
the reversibility of pyruvate kinase caused it to behave very
differently, with a major redistribution of ﬂux control.
Subsequent investigation by Cornish-Bowden and Cárde-
nas clariﬁed the issue: as discussed in Section 13.3.1, even if
§13.3.1, pages 332–336
the negative term in the numerator of the rate expression is
genuinely negligible this does not justify ignoring inhibitory
effects of products.
In retrospect this appears quite obvi-
ous, though it escaped recognition in more than 40 years of
metabolic modeling, as reactions considered to be irreversible
were almost always treated as product-insensitive as well.

Examples of computer models of metabolism
Many computer models of biological networks can be found
in databases such as JWS Online17 and Biomodels 18 but only
a small proportion of these refer to real metabolic systems
simulated on the basis of measured kinetic parameters for the
component enzymes. Some of those published in the past
15 years are listed in Table 13.2.
One might expect to see
more, but constructing a valid model requires a very large
amount of relevant data: the model of aspartate metabolism
in Arabidopsis thaliana (Figure 13.38), for example, contained
more than 90 measured parameters, and the others needed
similar numbers.
Moreover, despite the large amount of
enzyme kinetic data in the literature most of it is virtually un-
usable, derived as it is from a wide variety of experiments that
were carried out under conditions typically quite different
from those existing in vivo, and usually lacking information
about the reverse reaction or the effects of products or other
metabolites that are present in the physiological system.19
In addition, it is usually unsatisfactory to combine results
obtained by different groups. Apart from the studies of the
erythrocyte all of the examples mentioned were based on data
collected by a single research group with a clear intention of
constructing a model once sufﬁcient kinetic parameters were
available.

Is this effort worthwhile? Clearly it would not be if the
results from computer simulation bore little resemblance to
experimental results obtained under comparable conditions.
Bakker and co-workers addressed this speciﬁc question, and
showed in the case of glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei that
there was excellent agreement between experiment and sim-
ulation, and the same was true in the study of aspartate me-
tabolism by Curien and co-workers. These results allow some
conﬁdence that simulation is capable of yielding meaningful
information in circumstances where the corresponding exper-
iments are too difﬁcult, expensive or invasive to be carried
out.

Multiple lines between the same

presence of isoenzymes such as
the four aspartate kinases, and
the thicknesses of the lines are
proportional to the ﬂuxes in the

Eleven regulatory effects (in-
hibition, activation and poten-
tiation of inhibition) need to be
taken in account for modeling
the system.
The topics discussed in this chapter have profound implica-
tions for the future development of biotechnology and drug
discovery, and although some of these have been mentioned
during the course of the chapter their importance is such that
a general discussion is desirable.
The major message that has come from the study of mul-
tienzyme systems is that although their kinetic properties are
entirely determined by the kinetic properties of the compo-
nent enzymes they differ substantially from naive expecta-
tions based on studies of isolated enzymes.
The primary
reason for this is that enzymes in isolation are usually studied
in conditions where the substrate and product concentrations
are speciﬁed by the experimenter, and unwanted complica-
tions such as product inhibition can be eliminated by setting
374
13. Kinetics of Multi-Enzyme Systems
the relevant concentrations to zero. Moreover, the pH and
temperature can be chosen for experimental convenience, and
may often differ from those in vivo.
In physiological systems none of these simpliﬁcations are
possible: all enzymes act in the presence of their products
and other metabolites that may act as effectors, at a pH
and temperature that may or may not be convenient for an
experimenter. This means that their kinetic properties in a
complete system may be quite different from those expected
from consideration of their kinetics in isolation under initial-
rate conditions. An unfortunate consequence is that although
there is a large body of experimental data in the literature
describing the kinetic properties of enzymes, much of this
information is useless for predicting their behavior in phys-
iological conditions.
To know whether inhibiting an enzyme is likely to pro-
duce a therapeutically useful effect in vivo one needs to know,
as a minimum, whether its ﬂux control coefﬁcient for the
targeted pathway is large or, much more likely, small. If it is

small a very high degree of inhibition will be needed to pro-
duce a useful decrease in metabolic ﬂux, because decreases in
activity of such an enzyme will have no effect until the activity
is low enough to bring about a perceptible increase in ﬂux
control coefﬁcient. A concentration i0.5 of inhibitor sufﬁcient
to decrease the rate of the isolate enzyme by 50% will typically
have no visible effect in vivo, as illustrated in Figure 13.39. The
exact shape of the curve will depend on numerous factors,
so the curve drawn in the ﬁgure is purely schematic, but
it is not purely theoretical. For example, Rossignol and co-

enzymes of respiration. They give many examples in which
phenotypic manifestation of the genetic defect occurs only
when a threshold level is exceeded.
In many biotechnological applications, and occasionally
but less often in a therapeutic context, it would be useful to
be able to increase a ﬂux rather than decrease it. For exam-
ple, many microorganisms synthesize commercially valuable
products, and there would be an obvious value in being able
to increase the ﬂux far above the normal level. However, in-
spection of Figure 13. 17 should explain why, despite huge in-
vestment in such attempts since genetic manipulation became
feasible around 1980, the results have been disappointing at
best. In general, increasing the activity of an enzyme in vivo
rarely has any detectable effect. Supply-and-demand analysis

(Section 13.8: Hofmeyr and Cornish-Bowden) suggests that
§13.8, pages 359–362
biosynthetic pathways are usually regulated by demand for
the end-product, which means that all of the enzymes in the
supply block will have evolved to have small ﬂux control
coefﬁcients, this transfer of control from supply to demand
being achieved by cooperative feedback inhibition of the ﬁrst
committed enzyme in the pathway.
This implies that brute-force methods of increasing ﬂuxes
will rarely if ever work, because the regulatory mechanisms
evolved by microorganisms over billions of years have as
their primary effect to resist any attempt to increase ﬂux by
increasing activities in the supply block. Although it is obvi-
ous, it is important not to forget that microorganisms have
evolved in the direction of perfecting their metabolism for
their own needs, not those of a biotechnologist. On the other
hand, if the problem is caused by the regulatory mechanisms,
this suggests that using genetic manipulation to eliminate the
feedback inhibition may have the desired effect. In practice,
however, this has two problems: ﬁrst, eliminating a feedback
inhibition will tend to produce an unhealthy organism, so
although it may produce the desired results in the short term
it is likely to be difﬁcult to maintain a stable culture; second,
even in computer simulation it works much less well than one
might hope.
In an effort to quantify the results to be expected with dif-
ferent approaches, we examined four different strategies for

way of eight enzymes leading to two different end-products.
The various strategies for increasing the ﬂux to one of these
products may be summarized as follows:
1. “Opposition”: ﬁve-fold overexpression of the ﬁrst en-
zyme;
2. “Suppression”: suppression of the feedback inhibition
of the ﬁrst enzyme;

centration are calculated;

Increasing the demand can
increase the production of a
desired metabolite with
negligible effect on ﬂuxes in
other branches. This strategy is
marginally less effective than
evasion (Figure 13.43), but far
easier to implement.
The strategies are shown schematically in Figures 13.40–44
and the results are summarized in Table 13.3. Not only was
overexpression of the supply enzymes completely ineffective
for changing the ﬂux, but it also produced signiﬁcant changes
in metabolite concentrations. Suppressing the feedback loop
produced only a modest increase in ﬂux, accompanied by
large changes in metabolite concentrations (likely to be lethal
in a real organism). The “universal method” gave exactly the
results expected of it, but at the cost of varying ﬁve different
enzyme activities by amounts that needed to be calculated ex-
actly from exact knowledge of the initial state of the organism.
So this approach can be expected to be universal in theory
but very difﬁcult to implement in practice. The last strategy
listed proved to be almost as effective at increasing the ﬂux,
with tolerable changes in metabolite concentrations, and far
easier to engineer. It was based on the idea that if the primary
function of the regulatory mechanisms is to vary production
is response to changes in demand, then artiﬁcially increas-
ing the demand should have the desired effect of increasing
production. In practice engineering a leak in the membrane
containing the desired metabolite may be the easiest strategy
for producing an increase in demand.
The results in Table 13.3 illustrate another point that ap-
plies quite generally but has been given little emphasis in
this chapter: although metabolic ﬂuxes are difﬁcult to change,
metabolite concentrations are rather unstable, and can change
by large factors in response to variations in enzyme activ-
ity. Although the summation relationship for ﬂuxes (equa-
tion 13.12) tends to make most ﬂux control coefﬁcients small,
as we have discussed, the corresponding relationship for
concentrations (equation 13.13) places no corresponding con-
straint on concentration control coefﬁcients, which are typ-
ically large and negative for the substrate of the enzyme
considered, and large and positive for the product.
This
characteristic was exploited by Raamsdonk and co-workers
as a tool for revealing the functions of “silent genes” in yeast.
13.11 Biotechnology and drug discovery
377
Most mutations have no noticeable impact on an organism,
in the sense that they have no effect on growth or other easily
measurable ﬂuxes, but they do have readily observable effects
on metabolite concentrations, and so the metabolic functions
of the proteins they code for can be deduced from measure-
ments of these concentrations.
As discussed by Cornish-
Bowden and Cárdenas, this sort of approach can make a

In this section I have adopted a rather pessimistic point of
view as a counter to the unrealistic optimism that is some-
times expressed about how easy it will be to manipulate
metabolism for human ends.
However, one must not go
to the opposite extreme, and provided that enough time is
available even a very small increase in ﬂux can result in a
technologically useful accumulation of a useful metabolite.
Gilles Curien tells me that he has calculated that even though
the ﬂux in the aromatic amino acid pathway in plants is
typically about 0.1% of the photosynthetic ﬂux around 20%
of the carbon in an annual plant at the end of its life derives
from this “negligible” pathway.20

It is simply not possible to predict the effects of an inhibitor in
vivo simply from measurements of its effects on an enzyme in
vitro. It is essential to consider the enzyme as a component of
a system, and Gerber and co-workers have made a systematic
study of the relationships between inhibition type and sys-
temic properties of target enzymes.
Summary of Chapter 13
• Although enzymes have usually been studied in the absence
§13.1, pages 327–330
of other relevant catalytic activity, it is important for under-
standing their physiological roles to consider their behavior as
components of metabolic pathways.
• Certain pairs or triplets of metabolites, such as NAD and

bacterial fermentation lost its domination of the market when a competitor
succeeded in increasing the ﬂux to citrate by 0.5%: although theoretical dis-
cussions often examine how a tenfold increase in ﬂux might be achieved far
smaller improvements may sometimes be quite sufﬁcient to be economically

different metabolic reactions. Their total concentrations can
often be considered to be maintained constant by mechanisms
outside the pathways of interest.
• Metabolic control analysis is a way of quantifying the
§13.2, pages 330–332
sensitivity of metabolic ﬂuxes and metabolite concentrations
to each enzyme in a pathway.
• Key terminology in metabolic control analysis:
◦The elasticity is a measure of the sensitivity of the
§13.3, pages 332–341
rate of an isolated enzyme-catalyzed reaction to the con-
centration of any molecule (substrate, product or other
metabolite).
◦A ﬂux control coefﬁcient is a measure of the sensitiv-
§13.4, pages 341–344
ity of a metabolic ﬂux to the activity of one enzyme; a
concentration control coefﬁcient is the correspond-
ing measure for a metabolite concentration.
◦The response coefﬁcient shows how a systemic vari-
§13.7, pages 356–359
able depends on an external metabolite, and is the elas-
ticity of the enzyme acted on by the effector multiplied by
the appropriate control coefﬁcient of that enzyme. This
relationship is the partitioned response, and justiﬁes
analyzing effects of external metabolites as if they were
effects of changed enzyme concentrations.
• In studies of an isolated enzyme it is usual to consider the
§13.3.4, pages 338–341
rate to be determined by the concentrations of substrates,
products and effectors.
When the enzyme is embedded in
a metabolic system it is sometimes more accurate (though
still an approximation) to consider these concentrations to be
determined by the ﬂux through the reaction.
• The sum of all the ﬂux control coefﬁcients for a particular
§13.5.1, pages 344–347
ﬂux is 1.0: this leads to the idea that ﬂux control is shared by
all the enzymes in a system. The sum of all the concentra-
tion control coefﬁcients for a particular metabolite is 0.0.
• Connectivity properties show how the systemic properties
§§13.6.1–13.6.4, pages 350–355
(control coefﬁcients) of a system are determined by the local
properties (elasticities) of the separate enzymes.
• The relationship between control and regulation of a biosyn-
§13.8, pages 359–362
thetic pathway can be analyzed in terms of a supply block
(the part of the pathway that produces the “end product”)
and a demand block. This last is often omitted from text-
book representations of biosynthesis, an omission that renders
understanding of the regulation impossible.
Problems
379
• Metabolite channeling is direct transfer of a metabolite
from the enzyme that produces it to another enzyme that uses
it as substrate.
§13.9.1, pages 362–364
• Interconvertible enzyme cascades allow very much higher
§13.9.2, pages 365–366
sensitivity to a metabolite concentration than is possible for a
single enzyme, at the expense of ATP consumption.
• The equilibrium catalyzed by adenylate kinase allows small
variations in the ATP concentration to be ampliﬁed into large
relative changes in the AMP concentration.
§13.9.3, pages 366–368
• Computer modeling of metabolic pathways is now techni-
§13.10, pages 368–373
cally straightforward, but continues to be hampered by the
lack of suitable data for the enzymes involved.
• The summation properties have important implications for
§13.11, pages 373–377
biotechnology and drug discovery, but these implications
continue to be little known and understood.
Problems
Solutions and notes are on pages 469–470.
13.1 Consider an enzyme with rate given by the Hill equation
( equation 12.1), that is to say v = Vah/(Kh
0.5 + ah), under
conditions where the reaction is far from equilibrium
and product inhibition is negligible. What is the value of
the elasticity εv
a when the enzyme is half-saturated, with
a = K0.5? What are the limiting values that it approaches
when a is very small or very large?
13.2 The ﬂux through a metabolic pathway is found to be in-
creased by 25% when an enzyme thought to have a large
degree of control is overexpressed by a factor of two.
Approximately how much would the ﬂux be expected to
be increased if it were overexpressed by a factor of ten?
[Note. An exact answer would need more information.]
13.3 For an enzyme with a ﬂux control coefﬁcient of 0.1 for
production of a pigment in the normal homozygote of a
diploid organism, how much would the ﬂux be expected
to be decreased in a heterozygote with 50% of the normal
amount of enzyme? [Note. An exact answer would need
more information.]

13.5 Manipulation of the activity of an enzyme Ei in a meta-
bolic pathway reveals that it has a ﬂux control coefﬁcient
of 0.15 under physiological conditions.
Its elasticity
towards the product Si of its reaction is found to be
−0.25 under the same conditions.
The next enzyme
Ej in the pathway cannot be directly manipulated, and
so its control coefﬁcients cannot be directly measured.
However, studies with the puriﬁed enzyme indicate that
it has an elasticity of 0.2 towards its substrate Si un-
der physiological conditions. Assuming that Si has no
signiﬁcant interactions with any other enzymes in the
pathway, estimate the ﬂux control coefﬁcient of Ej.

that identifying the enzymes that catalyze the rate-
limiting steps in pathways leading to desirable products,
cloning these enzymes and then overexpressing them in
suitable organisms will allow greatly increased yields
of the desirable products. What implications does the
analysis of this chapter have for such a strategy?

Fast Reactions
14.1
Limitations of steady-state measurements
14.1.1
The transient state
It should be obvious that experimental methods for investi-
gating fast reactions, with half-times of much less than 1 s,
must be different from those used for slower reactions, be-
cause in most of the usual methods it takes seconds or more
to mix the reactants.
Less obviously, the kinetic equations
needed for the study of fast reactions are also different, be-
cause the steady state of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is usu-
ally established fast enough to be considered to exist through-
out the period of investigation, provided that this period does
not include the ﬁrst second after mixing (Section 2.5).
§2.5, pages 43–45
Consequently, most of the equations that have been dis-
cussed in this book are based on the steady-state assumption.
By contrast, fast reactions are concerned, almost by deﬁnition,
with the transient state (or transient phase) of a reaction before
the establishment of a steady state and cannot be described
by steady-state rate equations. This chapter deals with exper-
imental and analytical aspects of this phase.
The differential equations that deﬁne simple chemical re-
actions, such as those considered in Chapter 1, are linear and
Chapter 1, pages 1–24
have solutions that consist of exponential terms of the form
A exp(−λt), where t is the time, A is a constant known as
the amplitude, and λ is a constant that is called the frequency
constant in this chapter (but see Section 14.1.2). For example,

14. Fast Reactions
the second term of equation 1.3 is an exponential term with
frequency constant k and amplitude a0. Such an exponential
term is equal to the amplitude when t is zero, but decays
towards zero as t increases, and eventually becomes negligi-
ble. As illustrated by this example, a frequency constant is a
ﬁrst-order or pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant, but it is a more
general term as it can also be applied to processes that are not
of ﬁrst order.
Enzyme-catalyzed reactions are more complicated, be-
cause the differential equations that deﬁne them are not linear
and do not have analytical solutions consisting of exponential
terms. Nonetheless, it is usually possible, as will be discussed
in this chapter, to set up experimental conditions that allow
use of accurate linear approximations to the true differential
equations, and so the behavior of exponential terms remains
relevant.
14.1.2
The relaxation time
It is common, especially in discussions of the sort of methods
described in Section 14.3.7, to replace the frequency constant
§14.3.7, pages 399–400
λ by its reciprocal, usually written as τ and called the relax-
ation time (or time constant). Some authoritative texts, such
as those of Hammes and Schimmel and of Gutfreund, switch

arbitrarily from one convention to the other, using mainly
frequency constants to discuss systems far from equilibrium
and mainly relaxation times to discuss systems close to equi-
librium. This is a potential source of confusion, quite apart
from the spurious contrast between systems close to equilib-
rium and far from equilibrium that it implies. Even when
relaxation times are used consistently they present problems,
as their expressions are usually more complicated than those
of the corresponding frequency constants: for this reason it
is common in texts that use relaxation times to see equations
with left-hand sides that consist of sums of reciprocals. As
time is a somewhat less abstract concept for most people
than frequency, there might be some advantage in express-
ing relationships in terms of relaxation times if the times in
question had convenient physical meanings, but they do not:
even for a simple ﬁrst-order reaction the relaxation time is the
time required for the amount of reactant to decrease by about
63% (more exactly, to decrease by a factor of e), and such a
period can hardly appear less abstract than its reciprocal. It is
K. Hiromi (1979) Kinetics of Fast
Enzyme Reactions, Wiley, New
York
noteworthy, for example, that when Hiromi provided a table
(his Table 4.2) entitled “Physical meaning of the relaxation
time, τ”, the quantity actually tabulated was not τ but 1/τ.
14.1 Limitations of steady-state measurements
383
A minor disadvantage of writing equations in terms of
relaxation frequencies is that the quantity symbolized as λ
has no universally accepted and recognized name. In simple
reactions it is a ﬁrst-order rate constant,1 but using a term
such as “apparent ﬁrst-order rate constant” is not only cum-
bersome, but also a potential source of confusion if applied to
complicated examples far removed from ﬁrst-order kinetics.
In this book I shall call it the frequency constant.2
14.1.3
“Slow” and “fast” steps in mechanisms
Before entering into detail on methods for analyzing fast reac-
tions it is useful to ask why we need to make transient-phase
measurements at all: what can we learn from them that we
cannot learn from the steady state?
Steady-state measurements have been useful for elucidat-
ing the mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, but they
have the major disadvantage that, at best, the steady-state
rate of a multi-step reaction provides information about the
slowest step, and steady-state measurements do not normally
provide information about the faster steps. Yet if the mecha-
nism of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is to be understood it is
necessary to have information about all steps.
Before taking the argument any further, however, we need
to dispose of an apparent absurdity. In the steady state of
any linear process all steps proceed at the same net rate (the
difference between forward and reverse rates being the same
for every step), so it appears meaningless to designate one
of them as the “slowest step”, and Northrop, for example,
D. B. Northrop (2001) “Uses of
isotope effects in the study of
enzymes” Methods, a Companion
to Methods in Enzymology 24,
117–124
calls this an “obvious misnomer”. If one takes “slowest” to
mean proceeding at the lowest rate, then Northrop is certainly
correct, but if we take it to mean accounting for the greatest
part of the total time then a different view is possible.

may be generalized to any number of steps in series: the
reciprocal of the speciﬁcity constant is the sum of the recip-
rocals of the forward rate constants with each multiplied by
the product of equilibrium constants back to the ﬁrst step.

thus be regarded as the sum of a series of times. Although
the reversibility of the steps means that time taken by in-
dividual molecules to traverse the whole process may vary
greatly, it remains true that there is an average time that can
be considered the sum of the average amounts of time spent
traversing the separate steps; indeed, Van Slyke and Cullen

action of urease and of enzymes

discussed the kinetics of urease in just these terms many years
ago (Section 2.2), and Figure 14.2 illustrates how this type of
§2.2, pages 28–31
partitioning can be applied to the mechanism in Figure 14.1.
There will always be a step that contributes as least as much
to the total time as any other, and it seems no great abuse of
language to call this the slowest step, and to refer to steps that
contribute signiﬁcantly less as faster steps.
Thus although all steps have the same rate in the steady
state, it does not follow from this that an equal amount of
time is required for every step, so when we describe some
steps as slower than others we do not mean that they proceed
more slowly but that they account for a higher proportion of
the time consumed. For the example of Figure 14.2, therefore,
step 1 is the slowest step in the sense that it accounts for the
largest proportion of the total cycling time.

a sensitivity index for use in the study of isotope effects that
has properties similar to those of ﬂux control coefﬁcients. It is
perfectly possible (though not necessary) for one step to take
much more time than all the others put together, and if this
is true it is reasonable to call it the rate-limiting step. Even
if it does not completely dominate the sum, the time for the
slowest step will still usually be similar in magnitude to the
time for the whole process, so it will be quite common for a
single step to be roughly rate-limiting. Exceptions will arise
if the whole process contains a large number of slow steps
of similar times, but this is much less likely in mechanisms
for individual enzymes than it is for metabolic systems: the
latter may indeed contain a large number of components, and

natural selection can be expected to have eliminated large
variations in kinetic efﬁciency between them; but in chemical
systems rate constants for the individual processes typically
vary by orders of magnitude, and no natural selection can be
invoked to evened out the variations. Considerations of this
sort probably explain why the need to eliminate rate-limiting
steps from discussions of metabolic regulation became evi-
dent around a decade before the corresponding question was
seriously discussed for enzyme mechanisms.
Most of the objections to the term rate-limiting relate to
the tendency to treat it as synonymous with the more objec-
tionable term rate-determining, which is now found less often
in chemical or biochemical writing than it once was (though
it has by no means disappeared entirely, and may be found
in numerous recent papers, such as that of Myers and co-
workers).
As long as one takes the idea of a limit quite

literally, as an absolute boundary, then it is quite true that
the smallest ﬁrst-order or pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant in
a sequence sets a limit to the frequency of the whole process
that cannot be exceeded. The same applies in the metabolic
context: for any unbranched sequence of enzyme reactions
the smallest limiting rate in the series sets a limit to the rate of
the process as a whole.
14.1.4
Ambiguities in the steady-state analysis of
systems with intermediate isomerization
As discussed in Chapter 8, an experimenter has considerable
Chapter 8, pages 189–226
freedom to alter the relative rates of the various steps in a
reaction, by varying the concentrations of the substrates. Con-
sequently it is often possible to examine more than one step of
a reaction despite this fundamental limitation of steady-state
kinetics. However, isomerizations of intermediates along the
reaction pathway cannot be separated in this way, as we
may illustrate by reference to the simple three-step Michaelis–
Menten mechanism (equation 2.30), for which the deﬁnitions
of the Michaelis–Menten parameters were given in equa-
tions 2.31–2.33 for the forward reaction and equations 2.34–
2.36 for the reverse reaction.
As there are six elementary
rate constants in the mechanism, but only two Michaelis–
Menten parameters for each direction of reaction, it follows
that characterization of the steady state, or measurement of
the Michaelis–Menten parameters, cannot provide enough
information to specify all of the rate constants.
Measure-
ments of kinetic isotope effects may allow this problem to be
386
14. Fast Reactions
circumvented to some degree (Section 9.7), but only if extra
§9.7, pages 246–248
assumptions are made, and only for the simpler cases: if
there are three steps instead of two between the binding of
substrate and release of product no steady-state method can
reveal the existence of all the steps, let alone give information
about the magnitudes of the rate constants.
In general, as mentioned in Section 5.3, all of the inter-
§5.3, pages 113–116
mediates in any part of a reaction mechanism that consists
of a series of isomerizations of intermediates must be treated
as a single species in steady-state kinetics. This is a severe
limitation and provides the main justiﬁcation for transient-
state kinetics, for which there is no such limitation.
The conveniently low rates observed in steady-state ex-
periments are commonly achieved by working with small
concentrations of enzyme. This may be an advantage if the
enzyme is expensive or available only in small amounts, but it
also means that all information about the enzyme is obtained
at second hand, by observing its effects on reactants, and not
by observing the enzyme itself. To observe the enzyme itself,
one must use it in reagent quantities so that it can be detected
by spectroscopic or other techniques. This usually results in
such a high enzyme concentration that steady-state methods
cannot be used.
The advantages of transient-state methods may seem to
make steady-state kinetics obsolete, but there is no sign yet
that steady-state methods are being superseded, and one may
expect them to predominate for many years to come, in part
because the theory of the steady state is simpler, and steady-
state measurements require simpler equipment. In addition,
the small amounts of enzyme needed for steady-state mea-
surements allow them to be used for many enzymes for which
transient-state experiments would be prohibitively expensive.

this kind is said to be under-

plot of the deviations of the

As well as these practical considerations, the analysis of
transient-state data may be underdetermined because of a
numerical difﬁculty known as ill-conditioning.
This means
that, even in the absence of experimental error, it is possible
to obtain convincing ﬁts to the same experimental results
with a wide range of constants, and indeed of equations.
This is illustrated in Figure 14.3, which shows a set of points
and a line calculated from two different equations, both of
the type commonly encountered in transient-state kinetics.
Although a plot of residual errors, that is to say differences
14.1 Limitations of steady-state measurements
387
between observed and calculated points, shows an obvious
systematic character (inset to Figure 14.3), this plot requires
such an expanded ordinate scale that even a small amount of
random error in the data would submerge all evidence of lack
of ﬁt. The practical implication is that it is often impossible
to extract all of the extra information that is theoretically
available from transient-state measurements unless the var-
ious processes have very different frequency constants, or the
terms with similar frequency constants have very different
amplitudes.
The importance of this example should not be exagger-
ated. To some degree the problems visible in Figure 14.3 are

a consequence of choosing linear scales: in a semilogarithmic
plot (Figure 14.4) the different exponential terms are a little
better resolved. If accurate values of y are available over a
much longer time, for example to t = 100 in the units used,
the difference would become quite obvious: for example, at
t = 100 the value of ln y for the points would be −4.81
whereas the value for the line would be −5.39. Moreover,
Figure 14.4 illustrates two characteristics that are much less
evident in Figure 14.3. First of all, the human eye is far better
at detecting deviations from a straight line than deviations
from an expected curve: it is obvious in Figure 14.4 that the
points do not lie accurately on a straight line, but it is difﬁcult
to recognize that the curve in Figure 14.3 is not an accurate
ﬁrst-order decay curve. The second point is that it is very clear
from the residual plot of Figure 14.4 that there is a shortage
of data at short times, but more data than necessary at long
times. More generally, for any process characterized by ex-
ponential decay terms the natural scale of time is logarithmic,
not linear.
Ill-conditioning is not just a special problem of transient-
state kinetics, as it applies to any quantitative experiment
in which there is a temptation to calculate more parameters
from the observations than they can support. Its particular
relevance to transient-state experiments relates to the claim
that these contain much more information than steady-state
experiments, because in practice much of the extra informa-
tion may be difﬁcult to extract. It is also striking in Figure 14.3
that even though the three-term equation is similar in form to
the two-term equation there is no correspondence in values
between the two sets of parameters: there is no sense in which
one can say that inclusion of the third term has just added to
the information already provided by the ﬁrst two.

“Burst” kinetics
In the course of a study of the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hy-
drolysis of nitrophenylethyl carbonate, Hartley and Kilby ob-
served that the release of nitrophenolate became almost linear
after a short period, and that extrapolation of the straight lines
back to the product axis gave positive intercepts (Figure 14.5).
Because the substrate was not a speciﬁc one for the en-
zyme and was consequently poor, they had to work with high
enzyme concentrations, and the magnitudes of the intercepts,
which are known as bursts of product, were proportional to
the enzyme concentration (Figure 14.6).
This suggested a
mechanism in which the products were released in two steps,

If the ﬁnal step is rate-limiting, so that k3 is small com-
pared with k1a, k−1 and k2, then the enzyme exists almost
entirely as EQ in the steady state. P can be released before
EQ is formed, however, and so in the transient state P can be
released much faster than at the steady-state rate. One might
suppose that the amount of P released in the burst would be
equal to the amount of enzyme, and not just proportional to
it. However, this is accurately true only if k3 is much smaller
than the other rate constants; otherwise the burst is smaller
than the stoichiometric amount, as will now be shown, fol-
lowing a derivation based on that of Gutfreund.

tion of some enzyme–substrate
complexes” Discussions of the
Faraday Society 20, 167–173
If a is large enough to be treated as a constant during the
time period considered, and if k1a is large compared with
(k−1 + k2 + k3), then shortly after mixing the system effec-
tively simpliﬁes to the form shown in Figure 14.8, because the
reaction E + A →EA can be regarded as instantaneous and
irreversible, and the concentration of free enzyme becomes
negligible. This is then a simple reversible ﬁrst-order reaction
(compare Section 1.4), with the following solution:
§1.4, pages 10–11
[EA] = e0{k3 + k2 exp[−(k2 + k3)t]}
k2 + k3
[EQ] = k2e0{1 −exp[−(k2 + k3)t]}
k2 + k3
Expressions for the rates of release of the two products are
easily obtained by multiplying the ﬁrst of these two equations

In the transient phase, however, dp/dt is initially much larger

olated back to zero time, though the lag may be difﬁcult to
detect, let alone estimate, in practice, as illustrated in Figure

and the magnitude of the lag in production of Q follows
similarly:

The burst in P is not equal to the enzyme concentration but
approximates to it if k2 is large compared with k3.
The

equation implies that the burst can never exceed the enzyme
concentration, but reality is more complicated, because the
substrate concentration is not truly constant and decreases
throughout the steady-state phase. The steady-state portion
of the progress curve is therefore not exactly straight, and if
the rate decreases appreciably during the period examined
extrapolation to the axis can cause the magnitude of the burst
to be overestimated. This type of error can be avoided by en-
suring that there are no perceptible deviations from linearity
during the steady-state phase.
14.2.2
Active site titration
The discovery of burst kinetics led to an important method
for titrating enzymes.
It is generally difﬁcult to obtain an
accurate measure of the molarity of an enzyme: rate assays
provide concentrations in activity units such as nkat/ml,
which are adequate for comparative purposes, but do not
provide true concentrations unless they have been calibrated
in some way; most other assays are really protein assays and
are therefore unspeciﬁc unless the enzyme is known to be
pure and fully active. However, equation 14.2 shows that, if
a substrate can be found for which k3 is either very small or
zero, then the burst π is both well-deﬁned and equal to the
concentration of active sites. The substrates of chymotrypsin
that were examined originally, p-nitrophenylethyl carbonate
and p-nitrophenyl acetate, had inconveniently large k3 val-
ues, but subsequently Schonbaum and co-workers found that

and M. L. Bender (1961) “The
spectrophotometric determina-
tion of the operational normal-
ity of an α-chymotrypsin
solution” Journal of Biological
Chemistry 236, 2930–2935
under suitable conditions trans-cinnamoylimidazole gave ex-
cellent results. At pH 5.5 this compound reacts rapidly with
chymotrypsin to give imidazole and trans-cinnamoylchymo-
trypsin, but no further reaction readily occurs, k3 being close
to zero. So measurement of the amount of imidazole released
by a solution of chymotrypsin provides a measure of the
amount of enzyme.
Active-site titration by means of burst measurements dif-
fer from rate assays in being relatively insensitive to changes
in the rate constants: a rate assay demands precisely deﬁned
pH, temperature, buffer composition and other conditions
if it is to be reproducible, but the magnitude of a burst is
unaffected by relatively large changes in k2, such as might
result from chemical modiﬁcation of the enzyme, unless k2 is
decreased to the point where it is comparable in magnitude
to k3.

Experimental techniques
14.3.1
Classes of method
Steady-state experiments are usually carried out with a time-
scale of several minutes, at least.
They have not required
the development of special equipment, because, in principle,
any method that permits the analysis of a reaction mixture
at equilibrium can be adapted to allow analysis during the
course of reaction. In the study of fast reactions, however, the
short time periods involved have required specially designed
instruments and methods that are not just obvious adapta-
tions of those used for steady-state experiments.
The typical frequency constants of processes important
for understanding enzyme-catalyzed reactions range from
around 1011 s1 for the fastest proton- or electron-transfer
reactions to less than 1 s1 for the slower speciﬁc enzyme-
catalyzed reactions, or much slower, taking minutes or even
hours, for reactions with unspeciﬁc substrates, as shown
schematically in the lower half of Figure 14.10. However, as
shown at the top of the ﬁgure, ordinary steady-state methods

be extended to the millisecond scale, but this is still too slow
for many processes.
Flash photolysis (Section 14.3.5) and
relaxation methods (Section 14.3.7) bring all but the fastest
chemical steps within range.
Other methods in addition to those shown in Figure 14.10
are useful in some circumstances. Flash photolysis and pulse
radiolysis are techniques for generating unstable short-lived
intermediates rapidly and then observing their subsequent
reactions, and when they can be used the range accessible to
measurement extends to processes as fast as 1013 s1. Even
though there are few biological systems to which they can be
directly applied, the information that they have given about
simple chemical reactions contributes to our understanding of
the chemical steps that occur in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

ods known collectively as ﬂow methods. They are all derived
ultimately from the continuous-ﬂow method devised by Har-
tridge and Roughton for measuring the rate of combination of
oxygen with hemoglobin, which is illustrated schematically
in Figure 14.11. In this method the reaction was initiated by
forcibly mixing the two reagents, reduced hemoglobin and
oxygenated buffer, so that the mixture was made to move
rapidly down a tube of 1 m in length. To prevent laminar ﬂow
(Figure 14.12) of incompletely mixed components through the
tube, it was essential to include a mixing chamber in the
system to create turbulence (Figure 14.13) and ensure com-
plete and instantaneous mixing. As long as the ﬂow rate is

constant, the mixture observed at any point along the tube in
such an experiment has a constant age determined by the ﬂow
rate and the distance from the mixing chamber. So, by making
measurements at several points along the tube one can obtain
a progress curve for the early stages of reaction.
The principle of the continuous-ﬂow apparatus is shown
in Figure 14.11, which is not intended as a realistic represen-
tation of the original apparatus, but is drawn to emphasize
the relationship of the method to the stopped-ﬂow method,
which will be considered shortly. It required large amounts
of materials, which in practice limited its use to the study
of hemoglobin. Nonetheless, the experiments of Hartridge
and Roughton are among the most instructive in the his-
tory of biochemistry, worthy of study by all experimentalists,
whether they are interested in reaction kinetics or not, because
they illustrate how scientiﬁc ingenuity can overcome seem-
ingly impossible obstacles. They were done before automatic
devices for measuring light intensity became commercially
available, and the equipment that did exist required several
seconds of manual adjustment for making each measurement.
Although it might seem self-evident that processes occurring
on a time scale of milliseconds could not be studied with such
equipment, Hartridge and Roughton showed that they could.

Various major improvements to the design of rapid-mixing
apparatus by Millikan, Chance, Gibson and Milnes, and oth-
ers, led to the development of the stopped-ﬂow method, which
has become the most widely used method for studying fast
reactions. The essentials of the apparatus are shown in Figure

1. two drive syringes containing the reacting species,
2. a mixing device,
3. an observation cell,
4. a stopping syringe, and
5. a detecting and recording system capable of responding
sufﬁciently rapidly.
The reaction is started by pushing the plungers of the two
drive syringes simultaneously. This causes the two reactants
to mix, and the mixture is forced through the observation
cell and into the stopping syringe. A short movement of the
plunger of the stopping syringe brings it to a mechanical stop,
which prevents further mixing and simultaneously activates
the detection and recording system. The time that inevitably
elapses between the ﬁrst mixing of reactants and the arrival
of the mixture in the observation cell is of the order of 1 ms,
and is called the dead time of the apparatus.

the developers of ﬂow methods.
After service in the Radiation
Laboratory at the Massachus-
etts Institute of Technology
during the Second World War
he returned to the University of
Pennsylvania, where he spent
most of his subsequent career,
making major contributions to
the understanding of oxidative
phosphorylation and other
topics. He never retired—“Re-
tire? Why would I do that? I
enjoy research...”— and
published several papers in the
last year of his life.
In its usual form the stopped-ﬂow method requires a
spectrophotometer for following the course of the reaction.
This makes it particularly useful for studying reactions that
produce a large change in absorbance at a convenient wave-
length, such as a dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction in which
the oxidized form of NAD is reduced.
The method is not
restricted, however, to such cases, because other detection
systems can be used. For example, many enzyme-catalyzed
reactions are accompanied by the release or uptake of protons,
which can be detected optically by including a pH indicator
in the reaction mixture, an approach that dates back to its use
in the continuous-ﬂow method of Brinkman and co-workers.

In other cases one may exploit changes of ﬂuorescence during
the reaction (see for example Hastings and Gibson).

Quenched ﬂow
Porter pointed out that there are sometimes doubts about the
chemical nature of the events observed spectroscopically in
the stopped-ﬂow method. These can in principle be overcome
by using the quenched-ﬂow method (Figure 14.15).
In this
method the reaction is stopped (“quenched”) shortly after
mixing, for example by a second mixing with a denaturing
agent, such as trichloroacetic acid, that rapidly destroys en-
zyme activity; an other method is to cool the mixture rapidly
to a temperature at which the reaction rate is negligible. By

is varied by varying the length of the tube connecting the mixing chamber to
the quenching system.
varying the time between the initial mixing and the subse-
quent quenching, one can obtain a series of samples that can
be analyzed by chemical or other means, from which a record
of the chemical progress of the reaction can be reconstructed.
The quenched-ﬂow method requires much larger amounts
of enzyme and other reagents than the stopped-ﬂow method,
because each run yields only one point on the time course,
whereas each stopped-ﬂow run yields a complete time course.
It is often therefore appropriate to apply the quenched-ﬂow
method only after the proper questions to be asked have
established in preliminary stopped-ﬂow experiments. Con-

enzyme is responsible for the biological ﬁxation of molecular
nitrogen, and consists of two proteins, known as the iron
protein and the molybdenum–iron protein. MgATP2−is re-
quired for the transfer of electrons from the iron protein to the
molybdenum–iron protein, and is hydrolyzed to MgADP−
during the reaction.
The oxidation of the iron protein can
be observed directly in the stopped-ﬂow spectrophotometer
at 420 nm.
When the reaction is initiated by mixing with
MgATP2−it shows a single relaxation with a frequency con-
stant of 24 ± 2 s−1 (Figure 14.16a). By itself, this observation
does not establish that hydrolysis of MgATP2−and electron
transfer are directly coupled; instead, MgATP2−might merely
be an activator of the iron protein. To resolve this question
the rate of hydrolysis had to be directly measured, and this
was done by measuring the production of inorganic phos-

In the earliest versions of the quenched-ﬂow method, the
time between mixing and quenching was varied by varying
the physical design of the apparatus, that is, by varying the
ﬂow rate and the length of tube between the two mixing
devices. In practice this created severe restrictions on the time
scales that could be used and the method was impractical for
general use.
Many of the problems were overcome in the
pulsed quenched-ﬂow method, which was described by Fersht
and Jakes. In this arrangement, the reaction is initiated exactly
as in a stopped-ﬂow experiment, and a second set of syringes
is used for quenching. These are actuated automatically after
a preset time has elapsed after the initial mixing. The period
between mixing and quenching is controlled electronically
and does not depend on the physical dimensions of the appa-
ratus. As there is no need for long tubes, this system is much
more economical of reagents than the conventional quenched-
ﬂow method.
More detailed information about ﬂow methods may be
found in books such as Hiromi’s devoted speciﬁcally to
rapid reactions, or with a strong emphasis on them, such as
Fersht’s. More elaborate methods include the rapid scanning
spectrophotometer devised by Hollaway and White, which
is now available commercially, though mainly likely to be
found in specialized laboratories.
However, it offers con-
siderable advantages over the simpler types of stopped-ﬂow
equipment as complete spectra of the reaction mixture can be
observed during the transient.
This allowed, for example,
Marquez and co-workers, to study in detail the intermedi-
ates produced during the reaction of myeloperoxidase with
hydrogen peroxide.

ONALD GEORGE WREY-
FORD NORRISH (1897–
1978) was born in
Cambridge, and spent much of
his life and career there, which
he devoted mainly to the study
of photolysis and its application
to the study of very fast reac-
tions. Together with George
Porter (formerly his student) he
was awarded the Nobel Prize
for Chemistry in 1967.
Reagents cannot be mixed efﬁciently in less than about 0.2 ms,
and stopping the ﬂow of a mixture through an apparatus re-
quires about 0.5 ms. (Although one can conceive of stopping it
more abruptly, in practice shock waves would be created that
would generate artifactual transients in the detection system.)
14.3 Experimental techniques
397
Quenching, either chemically or by cooling, also requires
ﬁnite time. So there is a lower limit of about 0.5 ms to the
dead time that can be achieved with ﬂow methods, and it
is unlikely that improved design will decrease this appre-
ciably.
Processes that are virtually complete within 0.5 ms
cannot therefore be observed by ﬂow methods.
This is a
severe restriction for the enzymologist, because most enzyme-
catalyzed reactions contain some such processes, and there
are some for which the complete catalytic cycle requires less
than 1 ms.
Fersht, for example, lists seven enzymes with

the dead time for mixing at the start of a reaction is possible
if one uses the ﬂash-photolysis method invented by Norrish
and Porter, a technique that uses a high-energy pulse of ra-
diation to produce the reactive form of a reactant when it
is already mixed with the other reactants. This approach is
limited by the need to have a suitable photosensitive pre-
cursor of any reactant one needs to study, but for major
biochemical substances like ATP this is no longer a problem,
since the introduction of “caged ATP” by Goldman and co-
workers, an ester of the terminal phospho group of ATP with

The ester illustrated is a form of

enzyme active sites, but does
not react. However, the ester
bond can be photolyzed to yield
ATP, and thus can generate

X-ray crystallography was long regarded as being far too
slow to have kinetic applications, but this picture has changed
considerably as a consequence of developments in several
ﬁelds.
Photolysis now allows reaction intermediates to be
generated inside crystals from unreactive precursors, but it
would be of limited usefulness without additional methods
to collect X-ray data rapidly, and to perform the subsequent
analysis.

made possible by the use of synchroton radiation, which is
extremely intense but polychromatic, in contrast to the much
weaker monochromatic radiation used in conventional X-ray
crystallography.
Polychromatic radiation was used in the
original X-ray diffraction experiments by Friedrich and co-
workers, but it was rapidly supplanted by monochromatic
radiation, which gave results that were far easier to analyze. G
EORGE PORTER (1920–
2002) was born in
Yorkshire, and studied
at Cambridge with Ronald
Norrish, with whom he
developed the technique of
ﬂash photolysis. For this
discovery they shared the
Nobel Prize for Chemistry in
1967.
This revival after many years of a method that appeared obso-
lete almost immediately after its ﬁrst use required yet another
development, namely the enormous increase in computing
power that has been evident in the past few decades, which
has made it almost routine to analyze data that previously
seemed impossibly complicated.
Although synchroton radiation is inherently polychro-
matic it is possible to generate it with a relatively narrow

range of wavelengths, and monochromators exist that could
in principle be used to narrow the range still further to allow
use of essentially monochromatic radiation. In practice this
is not done, however, because it has compensating disad-
vantages. Use of monochromatic radiation requires rotation
of the crystal by about 0.2◦during the radiation, interfering
with observations of processes occurring on short time scales.
However, polychromatic radiation allows the entire set of X-

ray reﬂections to be excited instantaneously without rotation,
and this provides the major reason for using it.
As an example, we may consider a study of isocitrate
dehydrogenase by Stoddard and co-workers. To prevent pre-
mature binding of the substrate, isocitrate, it was diffused into
crystals of the enzyme in the form of a photolabile nitrophenyl
derivative.
The crystals were then exposed to X-rays for
10 ms, photolyzed to release the isocitrate and exposed again
to X-rays. Subsequent analysis of the crystallographic data
allowed analysis of substrate binding, and further experi-
ments were done with similarly labeled intermediates in the
reaction. Outlined like this in a few words such experiments
may appear straightforward, but in reality a high degree of
expertise and care is needed at all stages, from the design
and execution of the appropriate chemical modiﬁcations to
the ﬁnal analysis of the crystallographic data, as discussed in
Stoddard’s review.
Time-resolved X-ray analysis has become a very powerful
technique for direct observation of intermediates in reactions.
An example of an application to photosynthetic reactions
is described in a paper by Schmidt and co-workers, and
Schmidt’s review provides a more general perspective.
14.3.6
Magnetic resonance methods
Magnetic resonance methods, especially nuclear magnetic res-
onance, have a time scale of applicability similar to that of the
temperature-jump method. They are increasingly being used
for the study of protein structure, and have applications also
to the measurement of rate constants in systems at equilib-
rium, especially rate constants for dissociation of ligands, for
example from enzyme–inhibitor complexes. When a param-
agnetic metal ion such as Mn2+, Fe2+ or Gd3+ interacts with
an enzyme, either as a natural physiological component of the
reaction or, more often, as a substitute for a physiological ion
such as Mg2+, its electron paramagnetic resonance can also
be used, instead of or as a supplement to nuclear resonance.

Relaxation methods
M
ANFRED EIGEN (1927–)
was born in Bochum,
Germany. He studied
at Göttingen, where he subse-
quently developed methods for
studying very fast reactions,
initially chemical reactions, but
later extended to enzyme
catalysis. For this work he was
awarded the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry in 1967, shared with
Ronald Norrish and George
Porter. He has contributed to
efforts to understand the nature
of the living state and self-
organization, and in this area he
is known for introducing the
hypercycle model.
The problem of mixing time and other considerations of this
sort led to Eigen’s introduction of relaxation methods for
M. Eigen (1954) “Methods for
investigation of ionic reactions
in aqueous solutions with half
times as short as 10−9 sec.
Application to neutralization
and hydrolysis reactions”
Discussions of the Faraday Society
17, 194–205
studying very fast processes. These methods do not require
any mixing of reagents, although, as described below, it can
be useful to combine them with the stopped-ﬂow method.
In a standard relaxation method a mixture at equilibrium is
subjected to a perturbation that alters the equilibrium constant,
and one then observes the system proceeding to the new equi-
librium, a process known as relaxation. (In a sense, of course,
mixing reactants is itself a perturbation, and one can consider
any chemical reaction as a relaxation. In practice, however,
experiments in which the only perturbation is mixing of reac-
tants are not usually regarded as relaxation studies.) Various
different relaxation methods exist, of which the most familiar
is the temperature-jump method, with a perturbation consist-
ing of an increase in temperature brought about by passing
a large electric discharge through the reaction mixture: in
this way one can easily produce an increase in temperature
of about 10 ◦C in about 1 µs. Another kind of perturbation is a
pressure jump: this is useful for probing volume changes that
may occur during the catalytic process, but is more difﬁcult
to use because the changes in kinetic constants that occur
after a pressure change are typically much smaller than those
that result from the same input of energy in the form of a
temperature change.
The perturbation produced by an electric discharge is not
instantaneously converted into a change in temperature uni-
formly distributed over the whole reaction volume. Instead,
it takes at least 1 µs, and considerable care in the design
of the apparatus is needed to ensure that all parts of the
reaction mixture are heated uniformly.
Thus one can only
regard the heating as instantaneous if one conﬁnes attention
to processes that occur more than 1 µs after the beginning
of the perturbation. It is not likely that appreciably shorter
times can ever be achieved with irreversible perturbations,
but much faster processes can be studied with sinusoidal per-
turbations. Ultrasonic waves, for example, with frequencies
as high as 1011 s−1, produce local ﬂuctuations in temperature
and pressure as they propagate through a medium. These
ﬂuctuations produce oscillations in the values of all the rate

constants of the system, and study of the absorption of ultra-
sonic energy by a reaction mixture yields information about
these rate constants, as described by Hammes and Schimmel.

Enzyme systems are generally too complicated for direct ap-
plication of this approach, but the study of simple systems
has nonetheless provided information valuable for the enzy-
mologist: for example, the work of Burke and co-workers on

poly-L-glutamate showed that a major conformational change
of a macromolecule, the helix–coil transition, can occur at
a rate of 105–107 s−1. Obviously, conformational changes in
enzymes do not have to occur in the same range of rates,
but similar rates must be possible, and so the need for a fast
conformational change does not provide any objection to a
proposed mechanism for enzymic catalysis.
One disadvantage of observing the relaxation of a sys-
tem to equilibrium is that the equilibrium concentrations of
the transient species of particular importance in the catalytic
process may be too small to detect.
This difﬁculty can be
overcome by combining the stopped-ﬂow and temperature-
jump methods, and commercial stopped-ﬂow spectropho-
tometers now include a temperature-jump capability.
The
reactants are mixed as in a conventional stopped-ﬂow exper-
iment, and are subsequently subjected to a temperature jump
after a steady state has been attained. Relaxation to the new
steady state characteristic of the higher temperature is then
observed. This sort of experiment allows the observation of
processes in the early phase of reaction that are too fast for
the conventional stopped-ﬂow method, because the reactants
are already mixed when the temperature jump occurs. In the

standard kind of temperature-jump apparatus, in which the
temperature change is produced by an electrical discharge,
there is no provision to prevent the system from cooling after
the heating has occurred. This is the reason for the upper limit
of applicability of about 1 s shown in Figure 14.10. However,
if precautions are taken to avoid this problem the period can
be increased indeﬁnitely. For example, Buc and co-workers
used the temperature-jump method to study relaxations of
wheat-germ hexokinase lasting as long as 40 min.

Transient-state kinetics
14.4.1
Systems far from equilibrium
In Section 2.5 we examined the validity of the steady-state
§2.5, pages 43–45
assumption by deriving an equation for the kinetics of the
14.4 Transient-state kinetics
401
two-step Michaelis–Menten mechanism without assuming
a steady state.
This derivation was only made possible,
however, by treating the substrate concentration as constant,
which was clearly not exactly correct.
Solution of the dif-
ferential equations is unfortunately impossible for nearly all
mechanisms of enzyme catalysis unless some assumptions
are made; approximations must always be introduced, there-
fore, if any analysis is to be possible. In transient-state ex-
periments one usually tries to set up conditions such that the
mechanism approximates to a sequence of ﬁrst-order steps,
because this is the most general sort of mechanism that has
an exact solution.
As discussed in Chapter 5, virtually all steady-state sys-
tems in enzyme mechanisms can be analyzed in terms of a
single method, the method of King and Altman. Pettersson

the analysis of the transient-state kinetics of systems far from

cases, starting with the two-step mechanism shown in Figure
14.18, to illustrate how sequences of ﬁrst-order steps can be
analyzed. The system is deﬁned by a conservation equation and

three rate equations. The conservation equation is as follows:
x0 + x1 + x2 = xtot
(14.3)
It ensures that the requirements of stoichiometry are satisﬁed,
by requiring the sum of the three concentrations to be a con-
stant, xtot. The three rate equations are as follows:
dx0
dt = −k1x0 + k−1x1
(14.4)
dx1
dt = k1x0 −(k−1 + k2)x1 + k−2x2
(14.5)
dx2
dt = k2x1 −k−2x2
(14.6)
Any one of these three equations is redundant, as their sum
is simply the ﬁrst derivative of the conservation equation,
equation 14.3:
dx0
dt + dx1
dt + dx2
dt = 0
To solve the system, therefore, we can take it as deﬁned by
equations 14.4–14.5, ignoring equation 14.6.
Solution of a set of three differential equations in three
unknown concentrations is most easily achieved by eliminat-
ing two of the concentrations to produce a single differential

equation in one unknown.
First x2 can be eliminated by
using equation 14.3 to express it in terms of the other two
concentrations:
x2 = xtot −x0 −x1
and substituting this in equation 14.5:
dx1
dt = k1x0 −(k−1 + k2)x1 + k−2(xtot −x0 −x1)
= (k1 −k−2)x0 −(k−1 + k2 + k−2)x1 + k−2xtot

Next x1 is eliminated by rearranging equation 14.4 into an
expression for k−1x1 in terms of x0,
k−1x1 = k1x0 + dx0

which can be substituted into equation 14.7:

transients, and λ1 and λ2 are the corresponding frequency
constants. As in most elementary accounts of relaxation kinet-
ics, I shall concentrate on the information content of the fre-
quencies, which are simpler to treat mathematically than the
amplitudes. Nonetheless, amplitudes provide a potentially
rich source of additional information.
Because relaxation
methods involve input of energy, usually in the form of heat,
every relaxation amplitude depends on the thermodynamic
properties of the system, such as the enthalpy of reaction
∆H.
Consequently, amplitude measurements can provide
more accurate information about these thermodynamic prop-
erties than is available from ordinary measurements. Thusius
D. Thusius (1973) “Simul-
taneous determination of
equilibrium constants and
thermodynamic functions by
means of relaxation amplitude
measurements” Biochimie 55,
277–282
describes how this is done for the simple case of formation
of a 1 : 1 complex, and gives references to other sources of
information.
The values of the frequency constants in equation 14.8 are
as follows:
λ1 = 1
2[P + (P2 −4Q)0.5]
(14.9)
λ2 = 1
2[P −(P2 −4Q)0.5]
(14.10)
The solutions for the other two concentrations x1 and x2
have the same form as equation 14.8, with the same pair of
frequency constants as those in equations 14.9–14.10 but with
different amplitudes.
If k−1k2 is small compared with (k−1k−2 + k1k2 + k1k−2),
the expressions for the frequency constants simplify to (k1 +
k−1) and (k2 + k−2), not necessarily in that order, as λ1 is
always the larger and λ2 is always the smaller.
This sim-
pliﬁcation is not always permissible, but the expressions for
the sum and product of the frequency constants are always
simple:
λ1 + λ2 = k1 + k−1 + k2 + k−2 = P
(14.11)
λ1λ2 = k−1k−2 + k1k2 + k1k−2 = Q
(14.12)
This example illustrates several points that apply more
generally.
Any mechanism that consists of a sequence of
n steps that are ﬁrst-order in both directions can be solved
exactly, as shown by Matsen and Franklin. The solution for

the concentration of any reactant or intermediate consists of a
sum of (n + 1) terms, the ﬁrst being its value at equilibrium
and the others consisting of n transients, with frequencies
that are the same for all concentrations and amplitudes that
are characteristic of the particular concentration. In favorable
cases the frequency constants for some or all of the transients

can be associated with particular steps in the mechanism;
when this is true the frequency constant is equal to the sum of
the forward and reverse rate constants for the step concerned.
Another general point, not illustrated by the above anal-
ysis, is that reactants that are separated from the rest of the
mechanism by irreversible steps have simpler relaxation spec-
tra than other reactants, because some of their amplitudes are
zero. Consider for example the ﬁve-step mechanism shown
in Figure 14.19, in which two of the steps are irreversible: In

principle, each reactant should have ﬁve frequency constants,
and this is indeed what ought to be found for X4 and X5. But
X2 and X3 are isolated from the last step by their reversible
fourth step; they therefore have one zero amplitude each,
and only four frequency constants. X0 and X1 are isolated
from the rest of the mechanism by their reversible second
step; they therefore have three zero amplitudes each, and
only two frequency constants. Regardless of the presence of
irreversible steps, the total number of relaxations observed for
any concentration cannot exceed the number predicted by the
mechanism, but is often less, either because processes with
similar frequency constants are not resolved, or because some
of the amplitudes are to small to be detected.
All mechanisms for enzyme catalysis include at least one
second-order step, but any such step can be made to obey
pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics with respect to time, by ensuring
that one of the two reactants involved is in large excess over
the other.
It follows that at least one of the observed fre-

quency constants contains a pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate constant
and thus its expression includes a concentration dependence,
thus allowing measured frequency constants to be assigned
to particular steps.
Consider, for example, the mechanism
shown in Figure 14.20, which represents half of a substituted-
enzyme mechanism (Section 8.2.2) studied in the absence of

the second substrate. For this mechanism equations 14.11–
14.12 take the following form:
λ1 + λ2 = k1a + k−1 + k2
λ1λ2 = k1k2a
So a plot of the sum of the two frequency constants against
a yields a straight line of slope k1 and intercept (k−1 + k2)
on the ordinate, and a plot of their product against a yields a
straight line through the origin with slope k1k2, as illustrated
in Figure 14.21. All three rate constants can thus be calculated
from measurements of the frequency constants.

Simpliﬁcation of complicated mechanisms
Although a system of n unimolecular steps can in principle
be analyzed exactly, regardless of the value of n, it is in
practice difﬁcult to resolve exponential processes unless they
are well separated on the time axis. Consequently the num-
ber of transients detected may well be less than the number
present.

depends on the amplitudes, but one can make some useful
generalizations. If two processes have amplitudes of opposite
sign they are relatively easy to resolve, even if the frequency
constants are within a factor of 2. The reason for this is fairly
obvious: if a signal appears and then disappears at least two
transients must be involved, as illustrated in Figure 14.22. If
two neighboring transients have amplitudes of the same sign
it is much more difﬁcult to resolve them, because the decay
curve is monotonic and unless the faster process has a much
larger amplitude than the slower one its presence may pass
unnoticed (compare Figure 14.3, above).
Slow relaxations are in general easier to measure than fast
ones, because they can be observed in a time scale in which all
of the faster ones have decayed to zero. In principle, therefore,
one can examine the faster processes by subtracting out the
contributions of the slower ones. Consider, for example,the
following equation:
x = x∞+ A1 exp(−λ1t) + A2 exp(−λ2t)
and assume that λ1 is smaller than λ2 by a factor of at least
10. One can evaluate x∞by allowing the reaction to proceed
to equilibrium, and then determine A2 and λ2 by making
measurements over a period from about 0.5/λ2 to about 5/λ2.

k2 = 0.1. The straight part of the
curve on a logarithmic scale of y
allows A2 = 10.52, k2 = 0.103.
These three constants then allow x∞+ A2 exp(−λ2t) to be
calculated at any time, and by doing this in the early part
of the progress curve and subtracting the result from the
observed value of x one obtains data for a single relaxation
A1 exp(−λ1t).
This procedure is known as peeling, and is
illustrated in Figures 14.23–24 for a slightly simpliﬁed case
in which x∞is assumed to be zero. Notice that the errors
accumulate as one proceeds, and in the example k2 is much
better deﬁned than k1:
any inaccuracy in x∞(if it were
nonzero) would contribute to the errors in A2 and λ2, and
any inaccuracies in x∞, A2 and λ2 contribute to the errors in
A1 and λ1. Notice although that although the scatter in ln y is
essentially constant in Figure 14.23 this is by no means the
case in Figure 14.24, and the scatter increases substantially

negative: that is why the logarithmic curve in Figure 14.24

Subtracting the estimated

It follows from this accumulation of errors that although
in principle any number of relaxations can be resolved by this
method, in practice method works poorly if there are more
than two, and the faster processes are much less well deﬁned
than the slower ones. It is therefore advisable to create ex-
perimental conditions in which the number of relaxations is
as small as possible.
There was a simple example of this
in Section 14.2.1: although the three-step mechanism used
§14.2.1, pages 388–390
§14.2.2, pages 390–391
to explain the burst of product release should in principle
give rise to two relaxations, the number was decreased to
one by using such a high substrate concentration that the ﬁrst
relaxation could be treated as instantaneous.
Considered from the point of view of the enzyme, enzyme-
catalyzed reactions are usually cyclic: the free enzyme is
both ﬁrst reactant and ﬁnal product. This does not prevent
solution of the differential equations (provided, as before, that
every step is ﬁrst-order or pseudo-ﬁrst-order), but it does
lead to more complicated transient kinetics than one obtains
with noncyclic reactions, because a cyclic system relaxes to a
steady state rather than to equilibrium. It is therefore useful
to simplify matters by eliminating the cyclic character from
the reaction. There are various ways of doing this, of which

In
effect, this is what one does in using an active-site titrant
(Section 14.2.2). It has the important disadvantage, however,
that it usually means studying the enzyme with an unnatural
substrate.
A different approach is to carry out a single-turnover ex-
periment, in which the rate is limited by substrate, not by
§14.4.1, pages 400–404
enzyme, in conditions with e0 ≫a0. The Michaelis–Menten
mechanism can then be written as in Figure 14.25, which has
the same form as Figure 14.20, because the reaction must stop
when the substrate is consumed, and so no recycling of en-
zyme can take place. This approach has been comparatively
little used in recent years, but it remains potentially valuable
for determining the true active-site molarities of enzymes
(or other catalysts, such as catalytic antibodies) without an
assumption about purity, and, as Topham and co-workers
discussed, it remains valid in the presence of complications
such as the capacity of some protein molecules to bind reac-
tants without catalyzing any reaction. The essential idea is

Bender and co-workers accordingly showed that on can cal-
culate the true enzyme molarity by dividing one by the other
(see also Reiner).
In reactions with more than one substrate (other than
hydrolytic reactions), one can prevent enzyme recycling by
omitting one substrate from the reaction mixture. This is es-
pecially useful for enzymes that follow a substituted-enzyme
mechanism, because some chemical reaction occurs, and is
potentially measurable, even in incomplete reaction mixtures.
An early example of this approach was the study of aspar-
tate transaminase by Hammes and Fasella. By studying the
partial reactions of this enzyme, mainly by the temperature-
jump method, they were able to assign values to 10 of the
12 rate constants that occur in the mechanism (Figure 14.26).
Transaminases form a particularly attractive class of enzymes
for such studies on account of the easily monitored spectral
changes in the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate, that occur
during the reaction.
Treatment of enzymes that follow a ternary-complex mech-
anism is less straightforward, because a complete reaction
mixture is normally required before any chemical change can
occur. Nonetheless Pettersson provided a rigorous treatment
of the transient kinetics of ternary-complex reactions, and he

and Kvassman applied it to resolve some ambiguities in the
reaction catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver.
Single-turnover experiments can be carried out with ternary-
complex enzymes by keeping one substrate (not both) at a
much lower concentration than that of the enzyme.

example of this was the original burst experiment of Hartley
and Kilby, in which the order of release of products was estab-
lished with a high degree of certainty by the observation that
one product (the ﬁrst) was released in a burst (Section 14.2.1).
§14.2.1, pages 388–390
Strictly, one ought to show that the second product does not
also show a burst, because in principle both products could be
released in a burst if the last step of the reaction were a rate-
limiting isomerization of the free enzyme to regenerate its
original form. Similarly, one can deduce the order of addition
of substrates in a ternary-complex mechanism by varying the
combinations of reagents in the syringes in a stopped-ﬂow
experiment, as illustrated schematically in Figures 14.27–28.
If there is a compulsory order of addition, the trace seen
when the enzyme is premixed with the substrate that binds
ﬁrst is likely to be simpler than that seen when the enzyme
is premixed with the substrate that binds second: premixing
with the ﬁrst substrate means that the ﬁrst complex is already
formed when the syringes are actuated, but premixing with
the second substrate achieves nothing because no reaction can
take place until the enzyme is exposed to the ﬁrst substrate.

Systems close to equilibrium
In the temperature-jump apparatus the perturbation of the
equilibrium constant is not usually large enough to create a
state that is far from equilibrium. Analysis of the relaxation
kinetics is therefore fairly simple, with no requirement for
all higher-order steps to be made pseudo-ﬁrst-order, because
it is the terms in products of concentrations that render the
differential equations insoluble in strict terms, and these can
be neglected in systems close to equilibrium. A simple bind-
ing reaction (Figure 14.29) illustrates this point: If e∞, a∞

k−1 are deﬁned as those that apply at the higher temperature,3
that is to say the constants that deﬁne the system after the
perturbation, then the concentrations at any instant t can be
represented as (e∞+ ∆e), (a∞+ ∆a) and (x∞+ ∆x) respec-
tively. Then the rate is given by the following expression:
dx
dt = k1(e∞+ ∆e)(a∞+ ∆a) −k−1(x∞+ ∆x)
However, d∆x/dt is the same as dx/dt, and, by the stoi-
chiometry of the reaction, ∆e = ∆a = −∆x, so
d∆x
dt
= k1(e∞+ ∆e)(a∞+ ∆a) −k−1(x∞+ ∆x)
= k1e∞a∞−k−1x∞−[k1(e∞+ a∞) + k−1]∆x + k1(∆x)2
(14.13)
As it stands this is a nonlinear differential equation that has
no analytical solution. But the term that makes it nonlinear is
k1(∆x)2, and if the system is close to equilibrium, as assumed
at the beginning, this term can be neglected. Moreover, then
et rate at equilibrium is zero, as in any equilibrium, and so
k1e∞a∞−k−1x∞= 0, with the result that the ﬁrst two terms of
equation 14.13 vanish and it simpliﬁes to a linear differential
equation:
d∆x
dt
= −[k1(e∞+ a∞) + k−1]∆x
This can be solved directly by separating the variables and
integrating (compare equation 1.1 in Section 1.2.2, which has
dp

(1.1)
§1.2.2, pages 4–5
the same form), with the following result:
∆x = ∆x0 exp{−[k1(e∞+ a∞) + k−1]t}
in which ∆x0 is the magnitude of the perturbation when
t = 0. Thus, provided that the initial perturbation is small,
the relaxation of a single-step reaction is described by a single
transient with a frequency constant λ given by
λ = k1(e∞+ a∞) + k−1
3From the experimental point of view the perturbation is obviously the
heating, but it is easier to understand the analysis if we suppose that the
system was initially at equilibrium at this higher temperature, and that
∆e, ∆a and ∆x are the perturbations that would exist if the corresponding
concentrations were instantaneously changed to those for equilibrium at the
lower temperature.
410
14. Fast Reactions
As e∞, a∞and k−1/k1 can normally be measured indepen-
dently, measurement of λ permits individual values to be
assigned to k1 and k−1.
A similar analysis can be applied to any mechanism close
to equilibrium, without regard to whether the individual
steps are ﬁrst-order or not, because the nonlinear terms of the
type k1(∆x)2 can always be neglected. In general, a mech-
anism with n steps has a solution with n transients, though
this number may be decreased by thermodynamic constraints
on the allowed values for the rate constants.
In addition,
the number of transients observed experimentally is often
less than the theoretical number, because of failure to detect
transients that have small amplitudes or are poorly resolved
from neighboring ones.
In Section 14.3.7 we saw that it is often convenient to
§14.3.7, pages 399–400
observe a system relaxing to a steady state rather than to
equilibrium. Although this is not strictly a system close to
equilibrium it can be analyzed in the same sort of way. Con-

• Flash photolysis allows much shorter times to be studied
§14.3.5, pages 396–398

• Relaxation methods also require no mixing, and are based
§14.3.7, pages 399–400
on perturbations of a system already at equilibrium or
steady state, typically by a sudden change in temperature
(temperature jump).
• Systems far from equilibrium lead to nonlinear equations

14.3 In steady-state studies of an enzyme, a competitive in-
hibitor was found to have Ki = 20 µM, and this value was
interpreted as a true equilibrium constant. The Michaelis
constant for the substrate was found to be 0.5 mM. Sub-
sequently the following stopped-ﬂow experiments were
carried out: in experiment (a), one syringe of the ap-
paratus contained 50 µM enzyme, and the other con-
tained 0.4 mM inhibitor and 10 mM substrate; in experi-
ment (b), one syringe of the apparatus contained 0.4 mM
inhibitor and 50 µM enzyme, and the other contained
10 mM substrate. The transient phase of the reaction had
a frequency constant of 130 s−1 in experiment (a) but
67 s−1 in experiment (b). Estimate the on and off rate
constants for binding of the inhibitor to the free enzyme.
Do the results of the stopped-ﬂow experiments support
the original interpretation of Ki as a true equilibrium
constant?

Data analysis in an age of kits
One of the four experts consulted by the publishers before
agreeing to the project for this book questioned whether it
was useful to include a chapter on statistical aspects of en-
zyme kinetics, ﬁnding tedious the account of the uses of
residual plots, and pointing out that few readers were likely to
want to write their own nonlinear regression programs. The
other three experts thought differently, as do I, and so this
chapter is included in case any readers still think it useful to
know some of the theory underlying the methods they use.
We live in an age of “kits” for doing all sorts of experiments,
and few people today prepare their own chemical reagents for
carrying out speciﬁc procedures in the laboratory. However,
most teachers of biochemistry still think it desirable for users
to know what is in their kits or how they work, or what is
happening in an experiment. Even if no modern biochemists
make their own spectrophotometers, and few have much
knowledge of the underlying physics, they still need a basic
knowledge of Beer’s law, for example. A commercial data-
analysis program is the computational equivalent of a kit, and
using it effectively requires at least some idea of what it is
doing.

15. Estimation of Kinetic Constants
The argument that residual plots are tedious is very sur-
prising, as everyone engaged in any kind of quantitative
research that involves ﬁtting models to data needs to be aware
of the importance of residual plots. Any program for analyz-
ing such data ought to display at least one residual plot for
every regression calculated, whether the user asks for it or
not. Users who are not aware of the value of residual plots
will probably not choose to have them displayed, but if one
is automatically displayed after every calculation they will
begin to appreciate them.

Most enzyme kinetic experiments carried out since the 1930s
have been analyzed by means of straight-line plots of the
sort discussed in Sections 2.6.2–2.6.4, and of these by far the
most popular has been and remains the double-reciprocal plot
of reciprocal rate against reciprocal substrate concentration
(Section 2.6.2). The appearance of small computers in every
laboratory has led to an increase in the number of experiments
analyzed with computer programs, but graphical methods
remain in widespread use, most deﬁnitely for illustrating
results but to a considerable extent also for the actual analysis.
In any case, use of computer-based methods constitutes an
advance only if they are used with some understanding of
the underlying calculations and the assumptions implicit in
them.
It might seem that all valid plots ought to give the same
results, apart from slight subjective variations derived from
different ideas about where to draw the best lines, and that
computation would also give the same results, albeit with
greater consistency because of eliminating this subjective ele-
ment. If experiments could be done with perfect accuracy this
would indeed be the expectation, but in reality experimental
error is always present and consequently different methods
give different parameter values, because they handle the error
in different ways. This is illustrated by some sample calcula-
tions in Table 15.1. The top half of the table shows the effect
on 1/v and a/v of assuming the same additive error of +0.1
in each of ﬁve observations spanning the range from Km/5 to
5Km. Notice that although the errors in the v values are all ex-
actly the same, the resulting errors in 1/v vary more than 20-
fold, and those in a/v almost two-fold. (This large difference

explains why the error bars that were shown in Figure 2.14
varied greatly in length, whereas those in Figure 2.16 varied
much less: see Figures 15.1–2.) Moreover, as the bottom half
of the table shows, the results are neither quantitatively nor
even qualitatively the same when the original errors in v are
a constant proportion of the true values.
For simplicity all of the errors in Table 15.1 were calculated
as positive values, though in reality some would be positive
and some negative. If the calculation had been done with
negative errors the results would have been similar to those
shown (apart from sign changes), but not identical, because
the nonlinear transformations of v into 1/v and a/v have
asymmetrical effects in the two directions: that is why the
error bars in Figures 2.14–17 are asymmetric (all of them,
though the asymmetry is only noticeable for some of the
longer ones).
Even these complications could, with some

effort, be overcome, if real experimental errors were system-
atic (all of the same size and in the same direction) and of
known magnitude, as in Table 15.1. In reality, however, they
are of unknown magnitudes and they vary at random from
one observation to another. Thus transformation of the origi-
nal observations for more convenient plotting plots produces
nonlinear distortions of any errors present in the original data,
and these distortions make it difﬁcult to handle these errors
properly. The distortions may be large (as for 1/v in the upper
half of Table 15.1), or they may be reasonably small (as for
a/v in the upper half of Table 15.1); they may be of similar
magnitudes for different transformations (as in the lower half
of Table 15.1), or they may be of quite different magnitudes
for the same pair of transformations (as in the upper half of
Table 15.1).
All of this means that estimating kinetic parameters from
graphs is not as straightforward as it may appear at ﬁrst
sight. Many authors (including this one in an earlier book)
A. Cornish-Bowden (1976)
Principles of Enzyme Kinetics,
Butterworths, London
have drawn the conclusion that graphs should be avoided
and that serious parameter estimation should always rely on
computation. This conclusion is especially appealing when
one considers that nearly all of the methods to be described in
this chapter are suitable for expression as computer programs,
and many are far too laborious to try to apply any other way.
It is mistaken, nonetheless, because it overlooks two points:
ﬁrst, the human eye is much better at recognizing peculiar
15.2 The effect of experimental error on kinetic analysis
417
or unexpected behavior than any existing computer program;
second, all computer programs embody some assumptions
about the properties of the experimental errors underlying
the data, and if these are not appropriate the results from
a computer program will not be any better than what one
can expect from a poorly executed graph.
It is obvious,
moreover, that many users of computer programs have little
understanding of these implicit assumptions. For example,
there are inconsistent statements in many papers, to the ef-
fect that the observations were found to have approximately
uniform percentage errors and were accordingly given equal
weight: as we shall see below, equal weight is appropriate for
observations with uniform errors in absolute magnitude, not
when expressed as a percentage.
Readers who doubt that graphs still have a place in data
analysis and that tabulated output from a computer is suf-
ﬁcient should study the example shown in Table 15.2, in
which three different experiments lead to exactly the same pa-
rameter estimates as calculated from equations 15.7 and 15.9
(Section 15.3.2), with exactly the same error estimates as those
§15.3.2, pages 420–422
§15.5.2, pages 433–434
calculated from equations 15.19 and 15.21 (Section 15.5.2). It is
tempting to conclude that the parameter values from the three
experiments are equally reliable.
Construction of residual
plots as described in Section 15.8 will reveal how mistaken
§15.8, pages 443–448
such a conclusion would be.

Blind use of a computer program written by someone else
is rarely safe. It cannot convert a badly designed experiment
into a well designed one, and it cannot extract precise infor-
mation from poor data. Nonetheless, it is hardly realistic in
the 21st Century to suggest that all computer users should
be programmers, and provided that programs are used with
some attention to their underlying theory they can be a valu-
able tool. This chapter provides an introduction to the theory,
but I have dealt with it in more detail in another book.
Before leaving the topic of graphs we should note that
their function goes beyond analyzing data, a function that
may indeed be better fulﬁlled by computer; they also have the
essential role of illustrating the results of analysis. If readers

putting any trust in the values reported. Accompanying the
quantitative results by at least one graph to illustrate the qual-
ity and extent of the data should be regarded as essential, but,
increasingly, it is not. On the contrary, pressure from editors
to omit what they see as inessential information is producing
a trend in the opposite direction: more and more papers not

as it ignores the effect of experimental error, and as the whole
point of statistical estimation of parameters is to minimize the
effects of experimental error omitting it from the equation is a
recipe for searching in the dark. We can modify equation 15.1
to allow for the effect of experimental error on the observa-
tions in various ways, of which two correspond to simple
assumptions about their properties. If we suppose that all ob-
servations have the same coefﬁcient of variation, which means
that the errors are approximately uniform when expressed in
percent (Figure 15.3), then a multiplicative error term (1 + ei)
is appropriate:
vi = Vai(1 + ei)
Km + ai
(15.2)
but if we think that they have the same standard deviation,
which means that the errors are approximately uniform when
expressed in units of rate (for example in mM · min−1), then

The true error behavior may be more complicated than
either of the limiting cases in Figures 15.3–4, for example with
errors that increase with vtrue when vtrue is large, but do not
approach zero when vtrue is small (Figure 15.5). We shall not
consider such possibilities here.
The values of e1
i in equation 15.3 are not the same as those
of ei in equation 15.2 : that is why we need different symbols.
It is not essential to write the equations in this way: we could
use equation 15.2 to study a uniform standard deviation, or
equation 15.3 to study a uniform coefﬁcient of variation, but
that would add needlessly to the complexities of the analysis.
The advantage of using equation 15.2 for uniform coefﬁcient
of variation is that we then have an ei that behaves simply
without correction factors. In this chapter we shall take equa-
tion 15.2 as the standard form, because it corresponds better
to the results that have been obtained in the few investigations
that have been made of experimental error in enzyme kinetics
(carried out, for example, by Storer and co-workers, and by
Mannervik and co-workers). I shall not go through the alge-
bra that results from using equation 15.3, but will give some of
the results from such algebra when appropriate. As a bonus,
we may note that both the algebra and the arithmetic are
simpler when we assume a constant coefﬁcient of variation;
however, this is not a valid reason for preferring it, as the
choice should be based on the underlying error structure of
the data and not on convenience.
Expressing the Michaelis–Menten equation as equation
15.2 illustrates why straight-line transformations such as those
in Section 2.6 can give unsatisfactory results. As they were
§2.6, pages 45–53
obtained from equation 2.12 (the same as equation 15.1) by
perfectly correct algebra, it is difﬁcult to see at ﬁrst why they
can be other than correct. Once it is realized that it is not the
algebra that is at fault but the starting point, and that a more
complete expression of the Michaelis–Menten equation, as in
equation 15.2, cannot be recast as the equation for a straight
line, the difﬁculty disappears.

15. Estimation of Kinetic Constants
15.3.2
Estimation of the Michaelis–Menten
parameters
The problem of estimating V and Km as accurately as possible
may be expressed as one of ﬁnding the values that make the
deviations ei as small as possible.
If there are more than
one or two observations, it is not in general possible to ﬁnd
values that make all the ei zero. Instead, one can make the
average of all the e2
i as small as possible. We use e2
i here rather
than ei to avoid complications due to the occurrence of both
positive and negative values. (In principle one can achieve
a similar effect with least-absolutes ﬁtting, the signs of the ei
being simply ignored, but this leads to such difﬁcult algebra
that it is not usually done.) Thus we can deﬁne the best-ﬁt
values of V and Km as those that jointly minimize the sum of
squares of deviations, SS, deﬁned as follows:
SS =
n
∑
i=1
e2
i
(15.4)
The summation is made over all observations, as indicated.
The summation limits are normally obvious in statistical cal-
culations, and it is also normally obvious that we are dealing
with sets of observations rather than individual ones. So both
the limits and the subscript i can usually be omitted without
danger of ambiguity, and equation 15.4 can be written just as
SS = ∑e2
and in the rest of this chapter the equations will be written
in this style unless more than one type of index needs to be
considered.

partially differentiating equation 15.6 with respect to V and
Km and setting both derivatives to zero, the same conclusion
may be reached by a shorter and simpler route by solving

gives exactly the same result for the parameter value itself, it
is misleading when one considers the precision of the estimate
(Section 15.5). This result, which was ﬁrst given by Johansen

and Lumry, is exact; no further reﬁnement is necessary to

Corresponding results for a uniform standard
deviation in the rates
If we take equation 15.3 as a starting point instead of equa-
tion 15.2, substituting e’ into equation 15.4 instead of e in
the deﬁnition of SS, this is equivalent to assuming that the
original rates were subject to a constant standard deviation
instead of a constant coefﬁcient of variation.

analytical expressions for the best-ﬁt parameters. Instead they

tice that the results from using equations 15.10–15.12 are identical
to those from Wilkinson’s method, even though the detailed route
taken by the two calculations is different, that unweighted linear
regression to the double-reciprocal plot, with w)1/v* ? 1), gives
seriously divergent results, and that the other weighting schemes
give results close to the correct ones.
The results are illustrated
graphically in Figure 15.7.
The bottom two lines show the cor-
responding results obtained with equations 15.7–15.9 and by the
method based on the direct linear plot described in Section 15.4.5

should remember that they are derived from different assumptions

unique way of doing it, and a different approach, described
by Wilkinson, is often referred to in the literature, as it was
incorporated into Cleland’s widely used computer programs.

The method converges to exactly the
same result as the derivation given here (see Table 15.3), and
is about equally laborious in the computer: there is thus no
strong reason to prefer one rather than the other; however, I
prefer the method given earlier, which I ﬁnd easier to under-
stand and easier to generalize to other kinetic equations.
Slightly different formulae can also be found in the lit-
erature that give slightly different results from those from
Wilkinson’s method because they are not quite correct: for
example, in an earlier book I gave expressions equivalent to

Cleland gave ones equivalent to equations 15.10–15.12 with

The reasons why both of
these are incorrect are rather subtle, and they do not need to
concern us, because their effects on the ﬁnal results are very
slight.

the observed rates are more accurately considered as having
uniform coefﬁcient of variation (equations 15.7–15.9) or as
having uniform variance (equations 15.10–15.12). An alter-
native sometimes suggested, for example by Reich and by
Ottaway, and even in recent years, for example by Perdicakis
and co-workers, is to replace the vi values in the equations
1In statistical discussions the word linear refers to a particular param-
eter and means that the expression for the dependent variable (v in equa-
tion 15.13) does not contain the square or higher power of that parameter.
Equation 15.13 is linear with respect to both V and Km, but only because it is
an approximation. The exact expression, the Michaelis–Menten equation, is
still linear with respect to V but it is nonlinear with respect to Km. All of this
means that a linear equation is not necessarily the expression for a straight
line, and the expression for a straight line is not necessarily linear (though
usually it is).

This approach is superﬁcially attractive, especially as it
can be applied to any variable, such as 1/vi or ai/vi, not just to

is usually convenient to make it the sample variance is a very
poor estimate of the true population variance (Section 15.5.3),
§15.5.3, pages 434–436
which is what is needed for deﬁning an accurate weight.
Storer and co-workers showed that this method gives very

poor parameter estimates unless m is at least 5 for every group
of replicates, and m needs to be very large before the estimates
become better than those obtained with a reasonable assump-
tion about a suitable weighting scheme.
This should not be taken to suggest that making obser-
vations in replicate is not useful—on the contrary, it is very
useful, indispensable, even—but the utility lies elsewhere, as
discussed in Section 15.8.

Comparison between classical and
distribution-free statistics
The least-squares approach to data ﬁtting is the most conve-
nient general method, and the most widely used (apart from
drawing lines on graphs by eye), but it is not necessarily
the best. To demonstrate that the least-squares solution to a
problem is the “best” solution,2 we must not only deﬁne what

edition of Little, Brown & Co.)
we mean by “best”; we must also make a whole battery of
assumptions (illustrated schematically in Figure 15.8) about
the nature of the underlying experimental error, as follows:
2It is often claimed that Gauss used the assumption of a normal distribu-
tion of errors to prove that least-squares analysis would give the most precise
estimate of a parameter. What he actually did was the opposite: he assumed
that the least-squares solution was the most precise, and then derived his
probability distribution from that assumption.

1. The random errors in the measurements are distributed
according to the normal (Gaussian) curve of error.
2. Only one variable, the so-called dependent variable, is
subject to error. In enzyme kinetic measurements this
is generally taken to be the rate.

The magnitude of each

Figure 15.9. Correlated errors.
In a typical trace from a record-
ing spectrophotometer or other
instrument, the error at one
point is often similar to that of
its neighbors.
3. The proper weights are known. In the context of this
chapter this means knowing (knowing, not guessing!)
whether equation 15.2 or equation 15.3 or some other
equation is the correct starting point for introducing
errors into the kinetic equation.
4. The errors are uncorrelated, which means that the mag-
nitude or sign of any particular error implies nothing
about the magnitude or sign of any other error.3
5. Systematic error can be ignored, which means that the
distribution curve for each error has a mean of zero.
In practice we know little or nothing about the truth or oth-
erwise of any of these, and in consequence classical least-
squares data analysis is built on a much more fragile theo-
retical foundation than is commonly realized, even though
most scientists prefer to base their conclusions on as few
unproved assumptions as possible. An alternative branch of
statistics, known as distribution-free or nonparametric statistics,
offers hope of escape, because it dispenses with all of the
above assumptions apart from the last, which is retained in
a weaker form: in the absence of other information any error
is assumed to be as likely to be positive as negative. Perhaps
the simplest idea to follow from this reduction in the number
of assumptions is that the preferred estimator of the mean of
a set of values is not the sample mean but the sample median,
or the middle value when they are arranged in order: the
mean is the archetype of a least-squares estimator, whereas
the median is the archetype of a distribution-free estimator.
This is illustrated in a rather gross way in Figure 15.10, but
even when the aberrant observation is much less obvious than
it is in the ﬁgure the same general characteristics apply.
3Correlated errors are very common in traces from spectrophotometers
and other instruments.
In Figure 15.9, for example, one may see that at
any point along the curve the deviation is similar in sign and magnitude
to the deviation at neighboring points. The practical consequence of this
is to decrease the effective number of independent values in a statistical
calculation.
15.4 Statistical aspects of the direct linear plot

The advantages of using distribution-free methods can be
considerable, because they generally give much more reliable
information when the assumptions listed above are false. On

the other hand nothing comes without a price, and in this
case the price is that if all the classical assumptions are true
one will have somewhat poorer estimates than one could get
from least-squares analysis. However, in general the price is
small compared with the potential beneﬁts. Not the least of
these beneﬁts is that the theory underlying distribution-free
analysis is much easier to understand than classical statistical
theory.
As no distributions are assumed, no distribution
theory is needed, and indeed little theory at all, beyond that
needed for understanding coin-tossing experiments, as the
idea that every error is as likely to be positive as to be negative
is similar to the hypothesis that a coin is as likely to fall on one
face as on the other.
15.4.2
Application to the direct linear plot
The direct linear plot (Section 2.6.6) was originally introduced
§2.6.6, pages 51–53
as a way of applying distribution-free ideas to enzyme kinet-
ics, at the same time greatly simplifying the procedures and
concepts. For any nonduplicate pair of observations (ai, vi)
and (aj, vj), there is a unique pair of values of the parameters
V and Km that satisfy both observations exactly when substi-

These parameter values deﬁne the coordinates of the point of
intersection of the two lines representing the two observations
in the direct linear plot. Altogether, n observations provide
a maximum of 1
2n(n −1) such pairs of values. (This is the
maximum value rather than the actual value because the pairs
of values obtained from duplicate observations with ai = aj
are meaningless and must be omitted from consideration.)
The best-ﬁt estimate of Km can now be taken as the median
of the set of values Km,ij, and the best-ﬁt estimate of V as the
median of the set of values Vij. If there is an odd number of
values, the median is the middle one when they are arranged

Figure 15.12. Determination of median estimates from the direct linear plot.
Each pair of lines intersects at a point whose coordinates give an estimate
of Km and an estimate of V, as marked by the projections on the two axes.
As these intersections are automatically ordered by the plot determination
of the medians is a simple matter of counting to ﬁnd the middle estimate of
each series, or halfway between the middle pair if (as in this example) there
is an even number of intersection points.
If there were any intersections
outside the ﬁrst quadrant, giving rise to negative parameter estimates,
these would require special attention (see Figures 15.13–15 in Section 15.4.5:
pages 430–431). If such intersections are numerous, or if the arrangement of
intersections shows a clear and reproducible pattern, one should investigate
the possibility that the data do not ﬁt the Michaelis–Menten equation.
in rank order; if there is an even number, it is the mean of
the middle two. I shall use the symbols ˘Km and ˘V (rather
than, say, ˆKm and ˆV) for these estimates to emphasize that
they are not least-squares estimates.
There are two main
reasons for deﬁning them as medians for analyzing the direct
linear plot, in preference to a more familiar estimator like
the arithmetic mean: ﬁrst, the estimates Km,ij and Vij, are
automatically ranked when the plot is drawn, as illustrated
in Figure 15.12, and so no calculation is required to ﬁnd the
medians; second, the median, unlike other types of average,
is insensitive to extreme values, which inevitably occur quite
often in the direct linear plot, because some of the lines may
be nearly parallel.

considerations in the estimation
of enzyme kinetic parameters

The main advantage of this approach over the method
of least squares is that it requires no calculation, and it in-
corporates no abstract or difﬁcult idea such as the normal
distribution of errors. However, Cornish-Bowden and Eisen-
thal pointed out that it also has some important statistical
advantages, which will be outlined in the next two sections.
15.4 Statistical aspects of the direct linear plot
429
15.4.3
Lack of need for weighting
The distribution-free analysis of the direct linear plot is only
marginally inferior to the method of least squares when all
of the least-squares assumptions (listed in Section 15.4.1) are
§15.4.1, pages 425–427
true. In other circumstances it can be much superior, because
it depends on few and weak assumptions and is consequently
insensitive to departures from the expected error structure.
For example, the least-squares estimates of the Michaelis–
Menten parameters given by equations 15.10–15.12 are by
no means the same as or only trivially different from those
given by equations 15.7–15.9; if one uses equations 15.10–
15.12 when one ought to be using equations 15.7–15.9, or vice
versa, one will lose all the optimum properties of the method
of least squares and obtain poor estimates of the parameters.
What this means in practice is that to use the method of least
squares with conﬁdence it is essential to know the proper
weights that apply to the observations, to know whether they
are uniform in coefﬁcient of variation or uniform in standard
deviation, or some combination of the two, but in practice
one almost never knows this. The distribution-free approach
dispenses with any need to know the proper weights, and al-
though it may give marginally worse results than the correctly
weighted least-squares method it will normally do much bet-
ter than the least-squares method with incorrect weights.
15.4.4
Insensitivity to outliers
An outlier, or “wild observation”, is an observation with a
much larger error than expected from the error distribution
of the majority of observations.
If an experiment contains
one, it can have a drastic effect on least-squares parameter
estimation, but very little on distribution-free estimation. The
reason for this derives from the ordinary properties of means
and medians shown in Figure 15.10, but we can also illustrate
it with a simple example: at the time of writing my four
grandchildren are aged 6, 2, 7 and 4, and my age is 68, so
if the children are alone together in a room, the mean age
(ignoring months) of the people present is 19/4 = 4.75, and
the median age is (4 + 6)/2 = 5, but if I walk into the room the
mean age increases to 17.4—well over a three-fold increase,
but the median increases just to 6, a mere 20% increase. Me-
dian estimation of parameters as described in Section 15.4.2
§15.4.2, pages 427–428
is not as insensitive as this, because any wild observation
contributes to (n −1) wild lines in the plot, but it is still much
430
15. Estimation of Kinetic Constants
more resistant to outliers than least-squares estimation.
To summarize this section and the preceding one, we may
say that under ideal conditions the least-squares method al-
ways performs a little better than any distribution-free alter-
native, but it is so sensitive to departures from ideal condi-
tions that in practice it may perform much worse.

15.4.5
Handling of negative parameter estimates
All of the intersections in the direct linear plot ideally occur
in the ﬁrst quadrant (Figure 15.13), and thus give positive
estimates of both parameters, but in experiments with rather
large errors in the rates, the direct linear plot as originally de-
scribed (as shown in Figures 2.20 and 15.12) has a small nega-
tive bias, leading to ˘Km and ˘V values that are not distributed

about the corresponding true values but about values that
are too small, as discussed by Cornish-Bowden and Eisenthal.
This bias derives from the occurrence of intersection points in
the third quadrant, that is to say points with Km,ij and Vij both
negative. To understand how to correct the bias it is helpful to

consider why intersections should ever occur outside the ﬁrst
quadrant.
Intersections in the second and third quadrants arise from
quite different causes, and accordingly they require quite dif-
ferent treatment. Intersections in the second quadrant (Figure
15.14) can occur because the enzyme shows substrate inhi-
bition and the observations come from the part of the curve
where v decreases with increasing a.
If this is the correct
explanation it should be conﬁrmed by other intersections in
the second quadrant from other observations at similar range
of a values. However, if there is no evidence for systematic

departure from Michaelis–Menten kinetics, an isolated inter-
section in the second quadrant is most likely to occur when
both a values are large compared with Km, so that the two true
v values are similar enough to one another for experimental
error to rank the observed values in the wrong order. This
implies that the true value of V is similar to the two observed
v values, and that the true value of Km is much smaller than
the two a values. As this is also implied by the values of Km,ij
and Vij obtained by treating the intersection in the second
quadrant at face value, it follows that there is no reason to
give such intersections any special treatment.
Intersections in the third quadrant (Figure 15.15) have a
different explanation. They can also be a symptom of system-
atic error, in this case implying that the plot of v against a is

sigmoid and not a rectangular hyperbola, but again, this can
be conﬁrmed or ruled out by examining other intersections
from observations at similar a values. If systematic error is
not conﬁrmed, the most likely cause is that the two a values
are low enough in relation to the true Km for experimental
error to have caused the two v/a values to be incorrectly
ranked. This implies that the true Km is large compared with
the smaller a value and the true V is large compared with the
smaller v value: this is the opposite of what is implied by
the values of Km,ij and Vij obtained by treating the intersec-
tion at face value, as both of these are negative in the third
quadrant. This is the reason for the slight bias if the direct
linear plot intersections are all taken at face value, and it may
be corrected by treating intersections in the third quadrant
as giving large positive values of both Km,ij and Vij. Actual
numerical values do not have to be assumed; it is sufﬁcient to
say that they are large and positive. This is because numerical
values of the extreme members of a sample are unnecessary
for determining the median.

does the intercept on the 1/v

concentration, but the intercept
on the 1/a axis implies an
extrapolation beyond inﬁnite
substrate concentration.
This treatment of intersections in the third quadrant in
effect treats a negative number as being beyond inﬁnity rather
than below zero. Although one may feel uneasy about this,
extrapolating past an inﬁnite substrate concentration is what
every user of the double-reciprocal plot does every time the
intercept on the abscissa axis is interpreted as −1/Km (Figure
2.14, redrawn as Figure 15.16 to emphasize the nature of the
extrapolation).4

placements of the lines brought about by errors of reasonable
magnitude result in smooth displacements of the intersec-
tions: they move smoothly across either of the two axes and
never ﬂip from one quadrant to another by way of inﬁnity.
Because of this no special rules are needed for interpreting
intersections outside the ﬁrst quadrant of this plot.
4Negative absolute temperatures occur in nuclear magnetic resonance
experiments when the polarity of the external ﬁeld is suddenly reversed: as
this can be done much more quickly than the nuclei can reequilibrate the
initial state after the reversal is one in which the higher-energy states are more
populated than the lower-energy states, so a standard calculation of the spin
temperature leads to a negative value. Notice that such an over-energized
state is extremely hot, not extremely cold, so it makes more sense to regard it
as beyond inﬁnity than as below zero.

I have tried to keep mathematical complexities to a minimum

will only give some results that may be useful (though they

In these equations the weights w are the appropriate weights
to apply to values of 1/v for two different hypotheses about
the weighting appropriate for v: if the rates are assumed to be
uniform in coefﬁcient of variation the weight for 1/v is w = v2
and equations 15.14–15.15 are identical to equations 15.7–15.9;
if they are assumed to be uniform in standard deviation the
weight for 1/v is w = ˆv3v and they are identical to equations
equations 15.10–15.12.
There are various calculations that one can do to assess the
quality of a ﬁt, but two questions stand out:
1. How well does the calculated line agree with the ob-
served points?
2. How precisely are the parameter values deﬁned?
15.5 Precision of estimated kinetic parameters
433
The minimum sum of squares provides a starting point for
answering the ﬁrst question. In terms of the weighted ﬁt it
may be deﬁned as follows:
!
SS = ∑w
1
v −1
ˆv
2
(15.17)
which is equivalent to equation 15.4 if one substitutes w = v2
and calculates v with the best-ﬁt parameter values.
As it
stands, however, the sum of squares is not satisfactory be-
cause it is a sum rather than an average. The obvious remedy
is to convert it to an average by dividing by n, the number of
observations. However, that is too simple, because it seriously
overestimates the precision if n is small: the reason may be
seen by considering the extreme case of n = 2, when !
SS will
always be zero, as it is always possible to ﬁt two observations
exactly with the Michaelis–Menten equation, even though
there is no reason to suppose that the observations are exact.
Although this makes it obvious that a correction is needed,
it is less obvious how large the correction ought to be; here
I shall just state without proof that an unbiased estimate of
the experimental error can be obtained by dividing !
SS by
n −2, or, more generally, n −np,5 where np is the number
of parameters that have been estimated:

Variances of the Michaelis–Menten

implications of this are discussed in Section 15.5.4.
§15.5.4, pages 436–438
One minor complication is that when the rates are uniform
in standard deviation the values of w appropriate for inserting
in equations 15.18–15.21 are not the same as those needed in
equations 15.10–15.12 : for calculating the best-ﬁt parameters
we should use w = ˆv3
i vi, as already stated, but once they are
known we should replace these weights by w = ˆv2
i v2

in equations 15.18–15.21. The reasons for this change are sub-
tle (as explained elsewhere) and not important, because the

results are little changed if one simply ignores it and uses the
same weights throughout. No corresponding complication
applies to the assumption of uniform coefﬁcient of variation
in the rates, when the same weights w = v2 are appropriate
throughout.
15.5.3
Standard errors
Variance estimates do not have the same dimensions as the
parameters to which they refer, but the squares of those di-
mensions.
The square root of a variance has the same di-
mensions as the parameter to which it refers, however, and
is often called the standard error, its value being quoted in
the following style: V = 10.7 ± 1.2 mM · s−1, for example,
where 10.7 mM · s−1 is the estimated value and 1.2 mM · s−1
is the square root of the estimated variance.
There is no
point, and much absurdity, in recording a result any more
precisely than this (except in a worked example used to il-
lustrate the arithmetic rather than the result), for example as
V = 10.7137 ± 1.2077 mM · s−1, though one sometimes sees
such expressions in the literature. As a general rule, there is
rarely any reason to express a standard error with more than
15.5 Precision of estimated kinetic parameters
435
two signiﬁcant ﬁgures,6 and the corresponding parameter
value should never be expressed to more decimal places than
its standard error.7
A standard error has the same dimensions as the value
it refers to—the standard error of Km is a concentration, and
so on. It can be made dimensionless by dividing by the pa-
rameter value, to give the corresponding coefﬁcient of variation,
which is usually expressed in percent.
Once we have calculated a standard error, what does it
mean? It means that
1. if all the assumptions listed in Section 15.4.1 are true, in-
§15.4.1, pages 425–427
cluding in particular that we have ﬁtted the true model
and there is no systematic error,
2. if we regard the particular experiment we have carried
out as one of a universe of such experiments that we
might have carried out in exactly the same way and in
exactly the same conditions, and
3. if the number of observations n in each experiment is
inﬁnite,
then the true value of the parameter will lie within one esti-

mated standard deviation of the calculated parameter value
in about 68% of this universe of conceivable experiments. If
this seems rather an abstract meaning derived from a large
amount of supposition, that is unfortunate: wishing that a
standard deviation meant something more useful will not
make it true!
The third supposition is clearly false in all
real experiments, as we never have an inﬁnite number of
observations, but fortunately the bias due to the use of a
less-than-inﬁnite value of n can be corrected, according to a
principle discovered by W. S. Gosset, a brewer who published
theoretical work in statistics under the name “Student”. His
theory allows a standard error to be converted into a conﬁ-
“Student” (W. S. Gosset) (1908)
“The probable error of a mean”

§15.3.4, pages 424–425
dence limit at any level of conﬁdence, not just at 68%. As a
rough guide, one may take two and three times the standard
6This is because a standard error has a standard error of its own, which,
in ideal conditions, is about 70% of its own value, so, for example, if V =
10.7 ± 1.2 mM · s−1 (as suggested above), then we could express this as V =
10.7 ± (1.2 ± 0.8) mM · s−1, and, although we usually do not express it like
that, the point is that in general it would be optimistic to expect even as many
as two signiﬁcant ﬁgures of a standard error estimate to be meaningful. That
is why the approach mentioned in Section 15.3.4 does not work well.
7If one writes, for example, 10.7137 ± 1.2, what can the digits 137 possibly
mean? One should write 10.7 ± 1.2.

15. Estimation of Kinetic Constants
error as conﬁdence limits for 95% and 99% respectively (Table
15.4). This still leaves us with a deﬁnition of a conﬁdence limit
that is more abstract than we might like, and it still depends
on many assumptions of which some are almost certainly
false. There is little we can do about the abstractness, but
biochemists who are unhappy about so many assumptions
can decrease them by using distribution-free estimates.
The theory needed for calculating distribution-free conﬁ-
dence limits of Michaelis–Menten parameters was given by
Cornish-Bowden and co-workers. It is not particularly difﬁ-

cult (in fact it is easier to understand than that that underlies
the calculation of standard errors) but setting it out clearly
would require much more space than is appropriate in a book
on enzyme kinetics. I have, however, described it elsewhere.
15.5.4
Km as the least precise Michaelis–Menten
parameter
Equations 15.19–15.21 have an important consequence for the
relative precision with which the three Michaelis–Menten pa-
rameters can be estimated, but this consequence is obscured
by the different dimensions of the three parameters. How-
ever, dividing the variances by the squares of the correspond-
ing parameter estimates, they become:

As this expression must be negative in all normal circum-
stances (i.e. for positive values of the weights, parameter
estimates, rates and substrate concentrations) it is clear that
the middle term in equation 15.24 implies subtracting a neg-
ative value from the sum of two positive values (or adding
a positive value to this sum). This in turn means that Km is
in all normal circumstances less well deﬁned than either V or
V/Km.
This argument may appear too mathematical to under-
stand, but the same qualitative result can be obtained in a
less rigorous but simpler way by noting that in principle V
can be estimated from a single measurement of the rate at a
very high substrate concentration; likewise V/Km can in prin-
ciple be estimated from a single measurement at a very low
substrate concentration. However, estimating Km requires a
minimum of two measurements—in the simplest case the two
just mentioned—and will be subject to errors derived from
both of these together with additional errors derived from the
process of combining them.
The conclusion from this analysis has far reaching impli-
cations for many aspects of enzyme kinetics, even if one route
for reaching it was obscure and difﬁcult, and the other was
not rigorous. One implication is that it makes it easy to recog-
nize when reported parameter and their precision estimates
have been obtained with an invalid program, because, except
in exceptional circumstances equation 15.24 requires them to
obey the following pair of inequalities:
σ2( ˆKm)
ˆK2m
≥σ2( ˆV)
ˆV2
,
σ2( ˆKm)
ˆK2m
≥σ2( 
V/Km)
( 
V/Km)2
(15.25)
Expressed in words, this means that the coefﬁcient of varia-
tion of Km cannot be smaller than those of either V or V/Km.
If all three parameter values are listed in a table, then in-
clusion of precision estimates for Km and V but not V/Km
8It answers the following question: how does the variation of one param-
eter depend on the variation of the other?
438
15. Estimation of Kinetic Constants
should also raise suspicions, because there is no reason for
a properly written computer program not to calculate and
report all three.
Given that in Section 15.3 the primary parameters were
§15.3, pages 418–425
taken as 1/V and Km/V one might suspect that the lower pre-
cision of the Km estimate was just a consequence of treating it
as a derived parameter, but that is not the case. One can do the
initial ﬁtting directly with Km and V as primary parameters,
as is done in Wilkinson’s method, but, as illustrated in Table
15.3, the resulting parameter estimates are exactly the same
as they are if the method described in this book is used. One
would then estimate the precision of V/Km from those of Km
and V by means of an equation similar to equation 15.24,
which has the following form:
σ2( 
V/Km)
( 
V/Km)2 = σ2( ˆV)
ˆV2
−2cov( ˆV, ˆKm)
ˆV · ˆKm
+ σ2( ˆKm)
ˆK2m
(15.26)
However, in contrast to equation 15.24, in which the middle
term implies subtracting a negative value, the middle term
here implies subtracting a large positive value, because esti-
mates of Km and V always have a high positive correlation.
Thus the conclusion shown in inequalities 15.25 is entirely
consistent with equation 15.26, and the general relationship
does not derive from an arbitrary choice about the order in
which the parameters are calculated.
15.6
Generalizing the results to more than two
parameters
15.6.1
The general linear model
Most of the steady-state equations considered in this book
generate linear equations when written as expressions for the
reciprocal rate 1/v or for a/v.9
This has the consequence
that the least-squares equations developed in this chapter for
the Michaelis–Menten equation can readily be generalized
to most of the steady-state equations we are likely to need.
Consider, for example, the equation for competitive inhibition
9Obvious exceptions are equations for reversible reactions and most of
the equations for non-Michaelis–Menten kinetics. A less obvious exception
is the equation for pure noncompetitive inhibition, for which the linear
approach not does permit the two inhibition constants for mixed inhibition,
Kic and Kiu, to be constrained to be equal.

As indicated, this equation can be put into a one-to-one cor-
respondence with a generic linear equation that expresses a
dependent variable y in terms of two independent variables
x1 and x2, and three parameters b0, b1 and b2.
What this
means is that all the methods for analyzing linear models
that one ﬁnds in textbooks of statistics can be applied to this
equation. The same is true of most of the equations of four
or more parameters one can ﬁnd in this book. In all cases ex-
actly the same considerations apply for assigning the proper
weights as we have considered already for the Michaelis–
Menten equation.
Nonetheless, it is tempting to argue that it is not worth the
trouble to do this, because in all the cases where it is possible
there is the alternative of ﬁrst estimating apparent values
Vapp and Vapp/Kapp
m
and then using the Michaelis–Menten
or straight-line dependence of these on the concentration of
an inhibitor or another substrate to determine the parameters
of the complete equation.
This is effectively what is done
graphically in the various examples of primary and secondary
plots discussed in other chapters, and it is certainly possible to
do the same in the computer. However, Nimmo and Atkins
showed it is better to ﬁt all the parameters simultaneously,
because it leads to higher precision in the ﬁtted values.

Comparing models
As soon as the equation has more than two parameters an
important question arises: does the equation with more pa-
rameters ﬁt better than a simpler one? The naive answer is
that the equation that gives the smallest sum of squares SS is
the one that ﬁts best. However, this answer is wrong, because
introducing an additional parameter to an existing equation
always results in a smaller sum of squares. The equation for
mixed inhibition, for example, always gives a smaller sum
of squares than the equation for competitive inhibition, even
when the inhibition is obviously competitive. The compari-
son needs to be between different values of the experimental

If this decreases when np increases then we then need to ask
if the decrease is signiﬁcant.10 This can be assessed with an
analysis of variance, but it is already become evident that the
question is more complicated than it seemed at ﬁrst sight: I
shall not pursue it here, but I have done so elsewhere. It is

usually possible to get a good idea of whether one model ﬁts
better than another by examining residual plots, as discussed
in Section 15.8.

Using existing programs for analyzing
kinetic data
Although the information in the earlier part of this chapter is
important for understanding how kinetic data should be ana-
lyzed, most readers will not want to implement the equations
as computer programs, and still less will they want to do the
calculations by hand. In practice, they will probably use a
commercial program such as SigmaPlot, and here I shall use
SigmaPlot 11.211 to illustrate some of the points to consider.
Other commercial programs are likely to give similar results,
but the ease or difﬁculty of navigating the menus (and read-
ing the manual) will doubtless vary.

To illustrate the procedure we can use the set of data

a choice between

provide a quantitative answer.
11Commercial software changes version numbers frequently, and doubt-
less version 11.2 will no longer be the current version by the time this book
is published. However, this is not important, ﬁrst because we are concerned
here with general points, and second because a new version is unlikely to be
so utterly different that nothing one can say about version 11.2 is still relevant.
15.6 More than two parameters
441
of which the ﬁrst corresponds to the usual way of writing
the Michaelis–Menten equation, with a ≡V and b ≡Km, so
we select that, and ﬁtting without selecting any other options
gives as results
a = 0.6904 ± 0.0368, b = 0.5965 ± 0.0683
Comparison with the top line of Table 15.3 conﬁrms that
SigmaPlot has indeed done what it is claimed to do: it has
found a best ﬁt to the data assuming constant variance in
the rate y, and the standard error estimates also agree with
the square roots of the expressions in equations 15.19 and
15.21. Below these results SigmaPlot displays some statistical
information, which most users are likely to ignore, but includ-
ing a line that ought not to be ignored, which reports that a
“Constant Variance Test” had been passed. What this means
it that no evidence was found that the assumption of constant
variance in y was false, but it does not mean that it was true,
and, in fact, with only six observations it would be difﬁcult
to have a clear indication one way or the other. With a larger
data set there might be a clear indication that the assumption
was false, and in this case the SigmaPlot manual suggests
trying a weighted ﬁt.
Alternatively, the data in Table 15.5
might be just one example of a large number of experiments,
all done in similar conditions, and from these we might have
stronger grounds for believing the assumption of constant
variance to be true, or not, as the case may be.
Suppose, then, that we need to weight the y values with
w(y) = 1/ ˆy2 as in the bottom line of Table 15.3, correspond-
ing to an assumption that the rates have uniform coefﬁcient
of variation.
The solution is to be found in Chapter 16 of
the SigmaPlot manual, which is rather forbiddingly entitled
Advanced Regression Examples. Before proceeding further it is
important to understand that choosing the proper weighting
function is not an advanced topic:12 users who are not inter-
ested in weighting their data correctly might as well stick with
graphical analysis. Correct weighting is an absolutely funda-
mental part of the task. SigmaPlot offers a choice between
four possibilities: (none), which really means giving equal
weight to each y value, reciprocal y, which means w(y) = 1/ ˆy,
reciprocal ysquare, which turns out to mean w(y) = 1/ ˆy2,13
12Would you regard the choice of a buffer with appropriate buffer capacity
at the pH to be used for an enzyme assay as an “advanced topic”?
13That is what it ought to mean on the assumption of a uniform coefﬁcient
of variation, but, as we shall see shortly, it is actually deﬁned differently (and
incorrectly) in SigmaPlot.
442
15. Estimation of Kinetic Constants
and w, which means that the user needs to deﬁne an addi-
tional variable w containing whatever weights are wanted. If
we choose the third option, reciprocal ysquare, then the ﬁtted
parameter values are
a = 0.6632 ± 0.0698, b = 0.5519 ± 0.0991
This result is more problematic, because these are not the same
as the values in the line for w(v) = ˆv2 in Table 15.3, that
is to say they are not the correct values for the assumption
of a uniform coefﬁcient of variation. They correspond to the
diamond marked with ? in Figure 15.7. Investigation of how
such a result could have been obtained shows that instead of
correctly minimizing the sum of squares weighted with 1/ ˆv2
weights been deﬁned as 1/v2, that is
SS = ∑
v −ˆv
v
2
instead of SS = ∑
v −ˆv
ˆv
2
This is wrong, because errors should be considered as de-
viations from the true values, not as deviations of the true
values from the observations (which makes no sense). As we
cannot know the true values we must measure them from
the calculated values instead. This consideration makes no
difference for simple errors, because (v −ˆv)2 ≡( ˆv −v)2, but
it does make a difference with relative errors. It is a small
difference, admittedly, and with a larger data set with more
precise observations it might well be a negligible difference,
but it should serve as a warning that third-party programs
may not be calculating what users think they are calculating.
A different difﬁculty arises if we need to obtain estimates
of V/Km and its standard error. The parameter value itself
is straightforward, as it is just a/b in the symbols used by
SigmaPlot. However, the initial regression calculation pro-
vides no information at all about the precision, and the stan-
dard error cannot be simply calculated from those of a and b.
To obtain this we need to repeat the regression with the ﬁtted
equation deﬁned as y = x/(a + bx).

It follows, therefore, that SigmaPlot can readily provide
best-ﬁt values of its parameters a and b, which we call V
and Km in the rest of this book, together with their standard
errors. What about V/Km, however, or a/b? Its value can
be calculated easily as a/b, but its standard error cannot be
calculated directly from those of a and b, and to obtain it
we need to repeat the ﬁtting procedure with the third choice
of equation given above, y = x/(a + bx), in which now

which accord with those expected. SigmaPlot does not make
it easy to obtain them, however.

Ideally, at the end of a ﬁtting exercise the program ought
to display all of the important information in graphical form
for inspection, as in Figure 15.18. In practice, however, curve-
ﬁtting programs more typically present the results as in Fig-
ure 15.19, which (apart from the added comments) resembles
the graph that SigmaPlot produces with default settings. Sev-
eral faults are evident: the origin is off-scale, as is the asymp-
tote for the value of ˆV, no parameter values are indicated,
there is no residual plot, and the labeling of the axes is generic
(x and y rather than a and v). Some of these can be adjusted
by editing the default behavior of the program, but that is not
the point, because most users never edit default settings, and
so it is important that the default settings should be as close
to ideal as possible. Most commercial programs can generate
residual plots if requested, but not without difﬁculty, and not
if not requested.

Residual plots and their uses
After data have been ﬁtted to an equation, it is always worth
checking whether the assumptions made in the analysis were
reasonable. Has the right equation been ﬁtted, or would a
more complex one have given a more credible explanation of
the observations, or would a simpler one (with fewer param-
eters) have done just as well? Has one made reasonable statis-
tical assumptions—for example, is the coefﬁcient of variation
constant, as assumed in Section 15.3.2, or would a constant
standard deviation (Section 15.3.3) be a better approximation,
or does the experimental error vary in a more complex way
than either of these imply?
Much the easiest way of attacking these questions is to
examine the residuals after ﬁtting, the differences between
the observed rate v and the corresponding rates ˆv calculated
from the best-ﬁt equation. I shall not attempt an exhaustive
treatment in this section, but will rather indicate the sorts of
uses to which residuals can be put. If the observed v values

444
15. Estimation of Kinetic Constants
as the calculated rate ˆv increases, but the relative differences
(v/ ˆv −1) should be scattered in a parallel band about zero, as
illustrated in Figure 15.20. On the other hand, if the observed
rates really have constant standard deviation, the simple dif-
ferences should be scattered in a parallel band about zero and
the relative differences should tend to decrease in absolute
magnitude as ˆv increases. Figure 15.21 shows examples of
such residual plots. They are easy to execute, regardless of
the complexity of the equation that has been ﬁtted, and they
may provide valuable information that is not readily available
in any other way.
It is advisable to have as many points as possible in a
residual plot, preferably more than 30, if it is being used to
decide on the correct weighting strategy.
This is to avoid
being unduly inﬂuenced by the aberrant behavior of one or
two observations, as there is always a large amount of scat-
ter.
Moreover, the human eye and brain are very good at
detecting patterns, with the consequence that they are also
good at seeing patterns where no pattern exists, and gen-
uinely random patterns, such as those in Figures 15.20–21,
tend to be perceived as less random than they really are. For
example, the fact that there are many more points above the
parallel band in Figure 15.20 than there are below looks like a
departure from randomness, but in fact it is what we should
expect: genuinely random patterns always look less random
than artist-drawn “random” arrangements. This is especially
true when the number of points is much smaller than it is
in Figures 15.20–21. Despite these reservations, even a plot
with as few as ﬁve to ten points can be useful as long as one
takes the interpretation as a suggestion rather than as deﬁnite
information.
Residual plots are also valuable for recognizing if the de-
viations from the ﬁtted equation are due more to systematic
error (failure to ﬁt the right equation) than to random scatter.
For this purpose the interpretation can be quite clear even if
there are only a few points. For example, the systematic trend
in the residual plot shown as an inset to Figure 14.3 (repro-
duced here as Figure 15.22) would be unmistakeable even if
there were only six or seven points rather than 19. That was
an artiﬁcially constructed example, but a real one is illustrated
in Figure 15.23. It shows a time course for product release

without the residual plot the ﬁt to the wrong model appears to
the eye to be excellent, the systematic nature of the deviations
becoming obvious only in the residual plot.

upper part of Figure 15.23 is quite obvious, and could easily

be detected by a computer program, provided that it made
the appropriate tests—a major proviso in practice as many
of the programs in common use today do not automatically
check for systematic trends in the residuals, even ones that
can easily be deduced from nonrandom runs of signs. In any
case, residual plots reveal to the practiced eye nonrandom
behavior that would be unlikely to be detected by a computer
program.
In their study of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II
(Section 13.1.3) Martins and co-workers give several examples
of residual plots with nonrandom trends that would not be
detected by any method as simple as testing runs of signs, and
would be difﬁcult to detect even by more elaborate automated
methods.

Authors rarely supply residual plots in published work, so
it is useful for the critical reader to be able to visualize what
they would look like if they were drawn. High precision is
not important for this purpose and it may often be sufﬁcient
to redraw a published plot as a residual plot by estimating the
coordinates by eye. This can be done rapidly by hand with
sufﬁcient accuracy (Figure 15.24). Even quicker and simpler,
one can imagine the residual error in a published plot by
looking at it along the plotted line with the eye close to the
paper (Figure 15.25).
This works best if the line drawn is
straight, but it is also possible with curves if the curvature
is slight.
It may often be impossible to draw any ﬁrm conclusions
from one plot alone, as the number of observations may be
too small, but if several lines are drawn in a plot, representing
different but related experimental conditions, or if several
related plots are presented in the same paper, one may be able
to judge them together. If all of several such cases indicate
the same sort of systematic trend, even if each one of them
has only four or ﬁve points, there is a high probability that
systematic error is present.
A single line with four observations showing an inverted
U-shaped distribution of residuals (for example a sign pattern
such as – + + –), need not have any special importance, but
ﬁve such cases in the same ﬁgure demand further investiga-

systematic errors that have passed unnoticed by the authors

experimental design is very
poor, with nearly all the ob-
servations concentrated in part
of the design space, then it may
be impossible to distinguish
systematic error from one or
two deviant points.
If a residual plot indicates that a more complex equation
is needed it is then necessary to decide which more com-
plex equation would be appropriate. Again, residual plots
should be helpful. Suppose, for example, that experiments
on the effect of an inhibitor have been interpreted in terms of
competitive inhibition even though a small but nonnegligible
uncompetitive component is present. In this case the incorrect
equation may well give acceptable results at low substrate
concentrations but inacceptable results at high substrate con-
centrations, because as the substrate concentration increases
competitive effects become less important whereas uncom-
petitive effects become more important. So a plot of residuals
against substrate concentration (with points for all inhibitor
concentrations superimposed on the same plot) should show
a deﬁnite systematic trend that would not be evident from a
plot of the same residuals against calculated rate.
To summarize, we can now consider a series of residual
plots that illustrate these points. Figure 15.27 a shows the
ideal result (similar to that in Figures 15.20b and 15.21a),
whereas Figure 15.27b shows the effect of inappropriate
weighting (similar to Figure 15.20a, and similar in idea to
Figure 15.21b, though different in detail). The plot in Figure
15.28 a shows obvious systematic error, because the points
clearly ﬁt a curve much better than they lie in a random
band around the axis.
The plot in Figure 15.28b may also
show systematic error, but is mainly symptomatic of a poorly
designed experiment incapable of giving a clear indication
of the proper equation. A plot like this indicates that it is
necessary to repeat the experiment with some observations
in the missing range of abscissa values.
As discussed in Section 15.5.3, it is important when pre-
§15.5.3, pages 434–436
senting the results of a calculation not to express the numbers
to an absurd degree of precision. However, it is also important
not to go to the other extreme: if a value of, say, 3.14 is
accurate to ± 0.02 then it should not be rounded to 3.1 at
the beginning of the calculation, because this implies loss of
information, and can result in residual plots with a sawtooth
appearance, as discussed by Cárdenas and Cornish-Bowden

and illustrated in Figure 15.29a. This is not to suggest that
the whole calculation needs to be done with ten signiﬁcant
ﬁgures at every step (though if the computer does the work
15.8 Residual plots and their uses

there is no reason to round the numbers at all), and in hand
calculations it is sufﬁcient to retain two or three signiﬁcant
ﬁgures more than the likely precision of the numbers. Figure

15.29b shows a smoother distribution of residuals, indicating
a complicated sort of systematic error that would be difﬁcult
to detect by computer unless the programmer had speciﬁcally
foreseen such an arrangement and tested for it. In general,
both of the plots in Figure 15.29 illustrate how residual plots
draw attention to oddities in the error distribution that might
pass completely unnoticed in any other kind of data analysis.
If the data contain a single outlier, perhaps the result of
a typing error when entering the data in the computer, this
should be very obvious in a residual plot, as in Figure 15.30a.
This plot is somewhat idealized, however, because in reality
the deviant point may not be grossly deviant, and there may
be some systematic error as well, as in Figure 15.30b. Thus
the interpretation will often not be as clear-cut as one would
like, and some judgment will be needed. Figure 15.31 shows
the same points again, ﬁrst with no shading, and second with
a large amount of labeling.
E. R. Tufte (1983) The Visual
Display of Quantitative
Information, Graphics Press,
Cheshire, Connecticut
Figure 15.30b is more realistic than the others, as it illus-
trates that deviations from expected behavior may be quite
small, and that more than one type of deviation may appear
in the same plot: although some systematic error appears
to be present it is no greater in magnitude than the obvious
random scatter, and so it is suggestive rather than conclusive;
likewise there is a suggestion of an outlier, but it does not
stand out as obviously as in Figure 15.30a.
Moreover, the
shading—an interpretation of data, not actual data—strongly
inﬂuences the interpretation likely to be placed on the plot by
an observer. In Figure 15.31a, exactly the same points shown
without shading and without labeling provide a more neutral
view, with a weaker suggestion of systematic error and a
much weaker suggestion of an outlier. In general, therefore,
although shading is useful for indicating an interpretation
to readers, the initial interpretation should ideally be made
without shading and without distracting information of any
kind.
Figure 15.31b again shows the same points but now they
are burdened with so much extraneous information of the
sort commonly included in published graphs that the points
themselves are almost lost in a sea of irrelevance and the non-
linear trend has become almost imperceptible. In a residual
plot the ideal amount of labeling is no labeling at all—no
scales, no numbers, no title, no variable names: all these, if
448
15. Estimation of Kinetic Constants
needed, can be adequately communicated in the legend. The
axes remain useful, but should be as imperceptible as possible
while remaining visible, as in Figure 15.31a.

These last comments refer speciﬁcally to residual plots,
and some of them do not apply to other kinds of graph, for
which, in particular, relegating important information to the
legend is not a good idea. Some points do also apply to other
graphs, however, and in any plot the major emphasis should
be on the data plotted and not, for example, on prominent
grids (Figure 15.32). Tufte, for example, recommends that if
ready-made graph paper with prominent grid lines is used
one should draw the plot on the back of the paper: they
will show through the paper clearly enough to be used for
drawing the plot, but faintly enough to be ignored after-
wards (Figure 15.33).
The grid can be made to disappear
almost completely (for example for photocopying or scanning
a graph) by using a backing sheet of the same color as the grid
(Figure 15.34).
Summary of Chapter 15
• Experimental error has very different effects on different
§15.2, pages 414–418
transformations of kinetic data.
• Experimental error can be introduced into an equation such
§15.3.1, pages 418–419
as the Michaelis–Menten equation either by introducing an
error factor (for a uniform coefﬁcient of variation) or an
additive term (for a uniform standard deviation).
• In either case the best ﬁt can be deﬁned as the parameter set
§§15.3.2–15.3.3, pages 420–424
that minimizes an appropriately deﬁned sum of squares.
• The direct linear plot can be understood as a type of
§§15.4.2–15.4.5, pages 427–431
distribution-free method, and depends on fewer assump-
tions about the experimental error than least-squares meth-
ods.
• Commercial programs for data analysis need to be used
§15.7, pages 440–443
with some understanding of what assumptions have been
built in by the programmer, and not as black boxes.
• Residual plots, plots of the differences between the observed
§15.8, pages 443–448
and calculate values of the dependent variable against a suit-
able abscissa variable, allow checks of the validity of the as-
sumptions made during the ﬁtting procedure.

Introduction
Experimental characterization of enzymes is now about a century
old.
Do practices that have been very successful for accumulat-
ing biochemical information continue to be appropriate in the 21st
century, and do the recommendations on enzyme kinetics made by
International Union of Biochemistry1 in 1982 provide a sufﬁcient

Biochemistry “Symbolism and
terminology in enzyme
kinetics” European Journal of
Biochemistry 128, 281–291
guide for today?
Several serious problems arise for anyone who
seeks to collect data from the published literature. In the ﬁrst place,
kinetic data are usually incomplete: it is rare to ﬁnd studies carried
in both forward and reverse direction with natural substrates, and,
important experimental information necessary for repeating a study
is often omitted. This is not always, of course, the fault of authors,
because, as discussed in Section 15.2, there is a modern tendency
§15.2, pages 414–418
of journals to discourage publication of any details they consider as
“unnecessary”. Nonetheless, the ultimate responsibility for includ-
ing every essential detail of their experiments rests with authors.
A ﬁnal point to consider is that enzymes have usually been stud-
ied one at a time, under conditions that may be convenient for the
particular enzyme but sometimes very different from conditions in
the cell. To take a famous example, alkaline phosphatase was given
that name because it is most convenient to study experimentally at
a pH of about 10, much higher than the pH of the cells in which it

is found. In fact Ross and co-workers showed that it is active at cel-

problem may have little importance if the objective is to characterize
the catalytic mechanism of an enzyme, but it becomes crucial if it
is to incorporate the properties into a metabolic model intended for
analyzing physiological behavior. Much of the data in the literature
have become virtually useless for modern purposes.
The Beilstein-Institut, a non-proﬁt foundation based in Frank-
furt, Germany,2 has become very conscious of these problems, as
described by Apweiler and others, and has set out to resolve them

by creating the STRENDA Commission (Standards for Reporting
Enzymology Data). This is responsible for preparing recommenda-
tions under three headings:
1. Data required for a complete description of an experiment;
2. Description of enzyme activity data;
3. Organism-related deﬁnitions of experimental conditions.
This work is not ﬁnished, but it is in a sufﬁciently advanced state to
allow a summary of the recommendations in this Appendix. They
have been incorporated into the Instructions to Authors of most
of the principal journals of biochemistry (as well as some other
journals), and the number can be expected to increase.3
Rather than simply reproduce the recommendations (which can
readily be consulted at the STRENDA website),4 I shall paraphrase
them here, with more discussion and explanation. This may serve
as a checklist for verifying that a paper submitted for publication
contains the minimal information needed for understanding it and
for repeating the work. Although most of the suggestions can be re-
garded as obvious it is remarkable how much essential information
is often missing from published work.

General information
Identity of the enzyme
Is the enzyme identiﬁed sufﬁciently precisely for readers to know
which enzyme has been studied? The information should include
an intelligible name, preferably the accepted name from the IUBMB
Enzyme List, and accompanied by the EC number,5 which for nearly
all enzymes, apart from very recently characterized ones, can be

found at the Enzyme Nomenclature website6. For newly characterized
enzymes that are not listed in Enzyme Nomenclature the reaction
catalyzed needs to be stated. If the amino acid sequence is known
the sequence accession number should be given: this can be found
in the database in which the sequence is given, and the sequence
accession number for the same sequence will be different in different
databases. The organism (species and, where known and relevant,
strain) should be speciﬁed. If different isoenzymes are known the
particular one studied should be speciﬁed.
Additional information on the enzyme
Is the information in the previous paragraph sufﬁcient? When ap-
propriate, tissue and organelle localization should also be given.
Was it localized in a cell or in an experiment? How was the local-
ization determined? If there was any post-translational modiﬁcation

The use of ontologies may be helpful for identifying the stan-
dardized names, reaction types, organism names, and so on, as
discussed by Degtyarenko. These have the advantage that unam-

biguous terms facilitate the formulation of queries to databases.
An example of such an ontology is the NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information) Taxonomy,7 which provides classiﬁca-
tions and names of all the organisms represented in GenBank.
Preparation
How was the enzyme prepared? If it was obtained from a commer-
cial source the supplier should be speciﬁed. If it was prepared in the
laboratory the procedure should be described in sufﬁcient detail to
allow it to be repeated, unless the full procedure is already available
in the literature, in which case the reference should be given, but
any modiﬁcations to the published procedure need to be speciﬁed.
If the natural protein has been modiﬁed artiﬁcially (truncated, His-
tagged, prepared as a fusion protein, additional insertions, deletions
was disbanded after delivering its report, but its initials live on. The work
of classifying enzyme-catalyzed reactions is now the responsibility of the
Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology. Although authors who report the discovery of a new
enzyme-catalyzed reaction are encouraged to suggest the subsubgroup in
which it should classiﬁed, that is to say the ﬁrst three numbers in the EC
number, they should not choose or report the fourth number, which can only
be decided by the committee. Violation of this rule can create great confusion,
as different authors may suggest different EC numbers for the same reaction,
or the same number for different reactions. When an enzyme is reclassiﬁed
the obsolete EC number is never assigned to another reaction. That is why
some numbers appear to be missing.

or other mutations and so on) the changes should be speciﬁed. An
enzyme cloned in a bacterial cell will normally not be identical with
the same enzyme in the original source (for example, the native
glycosylation will be missing), and so any such differences should be
noted. Knowledge of all post-translational modiﬁcations, whether
natural or artiﬁcial, is necessary for specifying the “version” of the
protein that has been studied.
Purity
How pure was the enzyme?
How was the purity assessed (for
example, was it apparently homogeneous on a speciﬁed gel, or
determined by mass spectrometry)? If it was a crude mitochondrial
fraction, for example, this should be stated.
Assay conditions
§4.1, pages 85–93
The description of the assay should specify what reaction was mea-
sured, written as a stoichiometrically balanced equation. The assay
temperature should be given in ◦C. If the assay pressure was not
atmospheric it should be given, and if the experiment was not done
in aerobic conditions this should be stated. What pH was used in
the assay? Was this checked experimentally, or calculated from the
buffer composition? All components and composition of the buffer
and concentrations should be given. If a coupled assay was used
full detailed of the coupling system should be given. Concentration
ranges should be given in acceptable units (such as mM, µM, as
appropriate) for all substrates, products, inhibitors and activators
used. The enzyme protein concentration should be expressed as a
molar concentration if the number of active sites is known, otherwise
as a mass concentration, such as g · l−1.8 The ionic strength of the
assay mixture should be given, especially if it is not obvious from
the buffer description.
Activity
Which initial rates of the reaction were measured?9 Was proportion-
ality between initial rate and enzyme concentration established, and
if so, how? What was the speciﬁc activity of the enzyme? This needs
to be expressed in appropriate units, such as the amount of product
8The SI (Système International) does not encourage unnecessary submul-
tiple preﬁxes, so g · l−1, for example, is preferred over mg · ml−1. However,
biochemists typically ﬁnd values in mg · ml−1 easier to visualize than ones in
g · l−1, and the essential point is that the information should be given in an
intelligible way.
9There is an implication here that the data refer to the steady state: the
STRENDA Commission has not at present considered standard conditions
for transient-state studies, but comparable requirements will eventually need
to be deﬁned.

formed under standard conditions per amount of enzyme or protein
present. An activity of 1µM · min−1 is often called 1 enzyme unit or
1 international unit, with the symbol 1 U or 1 IU. The corresponding
SI unit is the katal: 1 U = 16.67 nkat.
Methodology
A literature reference may sufﬁce for an established assay procedure
that is used without modiﬁcation, but any changes need to be speciﬁed.
As methods used for several years in a laboratory tend to change al-
most imperceptibly over time, authors should verify that the method
actually used is the same as the one described in the cited reference.
Was the assay continuous or discontinuous, direct or coupled?
§4.1, pages 85–93
In the case of a discontinuous assay, how was the reaction
stopped? In which direction was the reaction followed with respect
to the reaction equation provided? Which reactant was determined?
For example, NADH formation, O2 consumption. If the reaction
stoichiometry was not one-to-one (for example if 2 mol of substrate
was oxidized for 1 mol of O2 consumed) the deﬁnition of the rate
should be clear.
Other desirable information
Other relevant conditions should be included, such as concentra-
tions of metal ions such as Mg2+ and Ca2+. If the free concentrations
§4.4, pages 102–105
of these ions are known they should be given, otherwise the total
concentrations used in the assay. The equilibrium constant under
assay conditions should be given. Equilibrium constants for most
reactions of biochemical interest are now available from the NIST
(National Institute of Standards and Technology) database of Ther-
modynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions10, and methods for calcu-
lating them from known data are thoroughly described by Alberty.

Kinetic information

How many independent experiments were carried out?11 Were the
results reproducible?
Chapter 15, pages 413–450
There should be a report of the precision of estimated values,
such as standard error, standard deviation, conﬁdence limits, inter-
quartile range. It should be stated whether values are relative to one
subunit or to the oligomeric form.

11This is not the same as asking for the number of replicate observations
of each value within a single experiment: it is asking how many times the
entire experiment was done under the same conditions.

Appendix
Reporting kinetic parameters
As a minimum, characterization of an enzyme following Michaelis–
Menten kinetics12 should include values of V and Km for the forward
direction if the enzyme molarity is unknown. V may be expressed in
§2.3.2, pages 33–34
units or katals, as noted above. If the enzyme molarity e0 is known
V can be divided by the speciﬁc activity units to give kcat in s−1
or min−1, and kcat/Km expressed as a second-order rate constant,
for example in M−1 · s−1.
Km is a concentration, and should be
expressed as such, with units, and similarly for K0.5 as the cor-
responding concentration for half-saturation when the Michaelis–
Menten equation is not obeyed. In such cases the Hill coefﬁcient,
cooperativity index or some other measure of cooperativity should
be given. In all cases the method of obtaining the parameter value
§§12.2.1, 12.2.3, pages 286–290
should be stated, for example by nonlinear least-squares regression,
nonparametric estimation, or linear regression of a transformed form
of the rate equation. With all types of least-squares calculation, espe-
§§15.3–15.4, pages 418–431
cially linear regression, the weighting system should be stated, with
an indication of whether this was assumed or based on a suitable
analysis.
The range of substrate concentrations in terms of the value of
Km should be stated, as should the model used to determine the
§4.3.1, pages 95–98
parameters. If this was simply the Michaelis–Menten equation then
no further details are needed, but in other cases equations or refer-
ences to appropriate equations should be given. In all cases there
should be an explanation of why the chosen model was considered
to be the “right” model: were other models tested and rejected, and
§15.6.2, pages 439–440
if so by what criteria? Any deviations from the expected behavior
in extreme conditions (such as inhibition by excess substrate) should
be mentioned and quantiﬁed.
Inhibition and activation data
Time dependence. Does the degree of inhibition vary with time, or
can it be considered fully reversible? How was this determined?
Reversible inhibition.
The type of inhibition (competitive, un-
§§6.1–6.2, pages 133–140
competitive, linear, and so on) should be stated, together with a
statement of how this was determined. There are many examples
of inhibition that are stated in the literature to be “competitive” with
no evidence that this classiﬁcation is more than a guess. Appropriate
inhibition constants should be given with units and a statement of
how they were obtained. The fact that an inhibitor may be struc-
turally similar to the substrate is not a sufﬁcient reason to call it a

a one-substrate one-product reaction. In more complicated cases the recom-
mendations need to be extended appropriately.

competitive inhibitor. For tight-binding inhibitors rates of associa-
tion and dissociation rates should be given, together with the same
information as required for weak-binding inhibitors.
Irreversible inhibition. There are too many ways of characterizing

a comprehensive source, such as Tipton’s article or Chapter 7 of this
book.
Concentration for 50% inhibition. Concentrations for 50% inhibi-
tion have been used for both reversible or irreversible inhibition, and
are particularly common in the pharmacology literature. However,
their use is not recommended because they do not have a consistent
meaning. This is discussed in Section 6.5 of this book.
§6.5, pages 147–149
Activation data. The requirements for reporting activation data are
§6.7, pages 152–157
similar to those for inhibition data, and follow the same principles.
Further desirable information
If the kinetic mechanism has been established it should be stated.
Data for cooperative enzymes behavior should be accompanied by
an equation and mention of the model used for ﬁtting. The time-
Chapter 12, pages 281–325
dependence of enzyme reactions should be speciﬁed, that is to say
the duration of initial rate conditions at deﬁned substrate concen-
trations, and so on. Ideally an example of the primary data for at
least one experiment should be included. Journals often discourage
the presentation of primary information,13 but even if it cannot be
§15.2, pages 414–418
included in the publication as such it can still be made available in
supplementary material or on the authors’ web site, so there can be
very little justiﬁcation for not providing it.

2 with respect to A, order 1 with respect to B.
The value of 1
2 can be rationalized by supposing that
A exists predominantly as a dimeric molecule but the
actual reactant is the corresponding monomer A0.5. In
this case [A0.5]2 = K[A], where K is an equilibrium
constant, and so a rate that is proportional to [A0.5] will
be proportional to [A0.5]0.5, and the total A concentra-
tion, strictly [A] + 0.5[A0.5] = [A] + 0.5(K[A])0.5, will be
approximately the same as [A] if K is small.

the equilibrium between the two forms of NO varies
with temperature such that the proportion of dimer de-
creases steeply with temperature, then this decrease will
be more than sufﬁcient to compensate for the expected

value x = 0 implies a vertical asymptote given by
a + Km = 0, or a = −Km, and y = 0 similarly implies
a horizontal asymptote given by v = V.
These are
illustrated in Figure 2.5 (page 36).
2.4
The relative rate for a positive error of 10% is 1.1(1 +
a/Km)/(1 + 1.1a/Km), which has a value of 1.1 for a/Km
= 8.18. For a negative error of –10% the relative rate is
0.9(1 + a/Km)/(1 + 0.9a/Km), which is 0.99 for a/Km =
10.0. So to give satisfactory results regardless of the sign
of the error, a/Km must be at least 10.
2.5
Equilibrium constant = 5.1. The second experiment gives
1.5 for the same equilibrium constant.
A change of
enzyme could not by itself account for this difference.
Therefore, either the reported values are unreliable or
the experimental conditions were different in some un-
stated way (e.g. the experiment was done at a different
temperature or pH).

The plot of v against log a is the only one of those men-

cident with the horizontal axis, and similar difﬁculties

To the extent that the generalization is valid (and it is
certainly an oversimpliﬁcation) it can probably be ex-
plained by the relative difﬁculty of holding a very small
molecule such as H2O2 in the precise position needed for
interaction with the catalytic groups.
3.1
None of the k0 or k0/Km values are large compared
with those for many enzyme-catalyzed reactions with
speciﬁc substrates, and both of the two substrates used
are unnatural substances not found in nature, so there
is no possibility that either enzyme is optimized to act
on them. The results do not therefore allow any mean-
ingful comparison between the catalytic power of the
“pepzymes” and that of real enzymes. Moreover, as hy-
drolysis of these compounds has no obvious industrial
or medical use there is no basis for drawing conclusions
about possible applications.
3.2
There is no “right” answer, because if there were it
would have been possible to achieve greater success.
4.1
For a glucose 6-phosphate concentration of 0.1 mM and
v1 = 0.1 mM · min−1, the rate condition is 0.1 ≤0.1V2/
(0.11 + 0.1), hence V ≥0.21 mM · min−1.
4.2
Although some of the details will vary on account of
the formation of species such as Mg2ATP, the general
principles for handling binary complexes do not depend
on which component is held in constant excess over the
other, so maintaining the total ATP concentration 5 mM
in excess of total MgCl2 would be about as effective as
the inverse design for controlling the MgATP2−, but in
addition it would allows effects due to MgATP2−to be
distinguished from effects due to ATP4−.

The right-hand side of equation 5.1 (e1 + e2 + . . . en = e0)
is a constant, so its time derivative is necessarily zero.
If the time derivatives of all except one on the concen-
trations on the left-hand side are deﬁned as zero, the
exception must be zero as well, as otherwise the sum
would not be zero.
So deﬁning the last one as zero
adds no information to what is already known from the
others.

The conclusion follows from the fact that every valid
King–Altman pattern contains an arrow out of all except
one enzyme form. If there are two such forms that have
reactant concentrations associated with allarrows that
lead out of them it is impossible to avoid having at least
one concentration assocated with every pattern.

6.1
Under the original hypothesis the rate could be written
as v = VaL/(2+ aL), but this must be revised to read v =
V′aL[Km(1 + aD/Kic) + aL)]. If aD = aL and Kic = Km
then this can be written as v = V′aL(Km + 2aL). To give
the correct limit of V when aL is very large, V′ must be
2V, so VaL/(2 + aL) = 2VaL/(Km + 2aL), and so Km =
4 mM.
6.2
Kic = 4.9 mM, Kiu ≫5 mM. The data do not allow a
deﬁnite distinction between pure competitive and mixed
inhibition, because the highest substrate concentration
is less than Km, and thus too small to provide much
information about Kiu. In addition, the inhibitor concen-
trations do not extend to a high enough value to deﬁne
either inhibition constant accurately.

(b) yes (compare Table 6.3).
6.6
If a < Km, then Km(1 + i/Kic) is larger than a(1 + i/Kiu)
for any ratio of inhibitor concentration to inhibition con-
stant. Hence in these conditions a competitive inhibitor
increases the denominator of the rate expression more
than an uncompetitive inhibitor at the same concentra-
tion, so it decreases the rate more. The reverse applies
when a > Km. A competitive inhibitor exerts its effect
by binding to the enzyme form that predominates at low
substrate concentrations, an uncompetitive inhibitor by
binding to the form that predominates at high substrate
concentrations.
6.7
The logic of the analysis is essentially the same as for
the Dixon plot (Section 6.3.1), but the result is the op-
posite, the lines intersect where i = −Kiu, not where
§6.3.1: pages 140–144
i = −Kic. The results for hexokinase D imply that N-
acetylglucosamine and glucosamine bind at the same
site and that only one can be bound at a time, so K′

j for the regulatory
protein is the same as or similar to the inhibition constant

(a) 17 possibilities at each of 8 positions gives 178 ≈7 ×
109 sequences.
(b) 1 mg = 10−3/1600 = 6 × 10−7 mol without regard
to sequence.
Thus each of 7 × 109 species is rep-
resented on average by 8.5 × 10−17 mol. Multiply-
ing by the Avogadro constant 6 × 1023 gives about
5 × 107 molecules—ample for a representative sam-
pling even if the 17 possibilities at each locus are not
evenly and independently distributed.
(c) (8.5 × 10−17 mol)/(300 × 10−6 l) = 2.8 × 10−13 M.
The extreme smallness of this concentration in rela-
tion to a typical Km is irrelevant, because speciﬁcity
is not determined by Km; as the experiment required
the enzymes to choose between a (large) variety of
substrates simultaneously available it offered an ex-
cellent test of speciﬁcity.

small compared with k2. So k1 is about 5 × 10−3/10−4,
or 50 M−1 s−1. This would make k1 smaller by a factor
of about 104 than typical values for on rate constants
observed with numerous enzymes: not impossible, but
not very likely, so it suggests that the original analysis of
Kitz and Wilson was valid. For more detailed discussion,
see Cornish-Bowden.

Simple bimolecular substitution reactions (called SN2
reactions in textbooks on organic reaction mechanisms)
commonly proceed with inversion of conﬁguration at
the substituted atom. Retention, as with α-amylase, can
occur as a consequence of two successive substitutions,
as in a substituted-enzyme or double-displacement mech-
anism.
Net inversion, as with β-amylase, suggests
an odd number of inversions, as in a ternary-complex
or single-displacement mechanism.
(Note, however,
that the stereochemical data do not exclude a triple-
displacement mechanism, as discussed in Section 8.2.3).
§8.2.3, pages 195–197
8.2
The mechanism as described contains no ﬁrst-order steps,
so the net rate can in principle be increased without
limit by increasing the substrate concentrations. (In most
mechanisms there is at least one ﬁrst-order step, and sat-
uration arises because the chemiﬂux through such a step
cannot be raised indeﬁnitely by increasing the substrate
concentrations.)

The capacity to catalyze a half-reaction is characteristic
of an enzyme that follows a substituted-enzyme mecha-
nism. In this case the substituted enzyme is likely to be a
glucosylenzyme. Competitive inhibition of exchange by
glucose indicates the occurrence of a distinct noncovalent
enzyme–glucose complex: if this were the same as the
glucosylenzyme the enzyme would be a good catalyst
for hydrolysis of glucose 1-phosphate.

The equation as presented may be written as follows:
k1H/k3H = (k1H/k3H)1.442
(k2H/k3H)1.442 ;
hence
(k1H/k3H)−0.442 = (k2H/k3H)−1.442
or
k1H/k3H = (k2H/k3H)1.442/0.442
and so
k1H/k3H = (k2H/k3H)3.26

Use of kinetic isotope effects depends on assuming that
the isotopic substitution not only affects the rate con-
stants for the chemical step, but also that it has no other
effects. Chemical substitution would satisfy the ﬁrst but
not the second requirement.
10.1 (a) Let y =
Km/ ˜Km
= (KE + h)/(KE + h).
Then
dy/d ln h = hdy/dh = h(KEA −KE)/(KEA + h)2,
and d2y/d(ln h)2 = hdy/d ln h = h(KEA −KE)(KEA −
h)/(KEA + h)3, which is zero if h = KEA, that is to say
if pH = pKEA;
(b) pH = pKE.
10.2 An expression such as log Km is really a shorthand for
log(Km/K0
m), where K0
m) (most likely deﬁned as 1 mM)
is an implied standard state, and log V and log(V/Km)
are to be interpreted similarly.
The deﬁnitions of the
implied standard states (that is to say the choice of units
of measurement) affect the heights of the curves above
the abscissa axis, but they have no effect on their shapes
and in particular they have no effect on the pH values at
which the slope changes. Thus the standard states can be
left undeﬁned without invalidating the determination of
pKa values.
10.3 The width at the half-height is 7.5 −5.7 = 1.8, and from
Table 10.1 this corresponds to a difference of 1.22 be-
tween the pK values, which are thus pK1 = 6.6 −0.61 =
5.99; pK2 = 6.6 + 0.61 = 7.21. If the value of 6.1 refers
to pK11, then pK12 = 6.64, pK22 = 7.10, pK21 = 6.56;
if it refers to pK22, then pK11 = 7.10, pK12 = 6.03,
pK21 = 7.17.
10.4 First note that the rate constants for binding and re-
lease of substrate and product can only be independent
of the state of protonation if H2E, H2EA and H2EP
have the same pair of dissociation constants K1 and
K2. It is thus unnecessary to deﬁne f (h) separately for
H2E, H2EA and H2EP. Then, Km = (k−1/k1) + k2(k3 −
k−1) f (h)/[(k2 + k−2) f (h) + k3]k1 This can be indepen-
dent of pH either if k2 is very small or if k3 = k−1. In
either case it simpliﬁes to Km = k−1/k1.

11.2 The details of the plot of entropy of activation against
enthalpy of activation will vary with the particular num-
bers used, but it is likely to resemble the one illustrated,
which was calculated from the following set of telephone

cannot have one either. The problem was adapted from
one suggested by McBane, and his article provides more
information.
12.1 Slope = h −1.
This plot expresses the cooperativity
more directly than the Hill plot, because its slope always
has the same sign as the sign of the cooperativity: a
positive slope means positive cooperativity; a zero slope
means no cooperativity; a negative slope means negative
cooperativity.
12.2 v = [V1a(Km1 + a)] + [V2a(Km2 + a)]; dv/da = [Km1V1/
(Km1 + a)2] + [Km2V2/(Km2 + a)2]; d2v/da2 = −2Km1V1/
(Km1 + a)3] −[2Km2V2/(Km2 + a)3]. As the kinetic pa-
rameters and the substrate concentration must all be
positive, this expression can only be negative. A plot of
v against a therefore cannot be sigmoid.
12.3 h = 1 + [a/(K2 + a)] −[a/(K1 + a)]. The extreme value
of 2/[1 + (K2/K1)0.5 occurs when a = (K1K2)0.5.

To show this, derive an expression for
y/(1 −y) from equation 12.6, and then ﬁnd the condi-
tion for identity of the two expressions when a is negli-
gible and when a is very large.
12.5 At low concentrations there are abundant sites for both
substrate and inhibitor, and competition between them
is minimal; thus the predominant effect of inhibitor is to
promote the conformational change that favors substrate
binding, so it appears as an activator. At high concentra-
tions the ordinary competition predominates and so the
result is the expected inhibition.

13.2 Deﬁning J0 = 1 at e = 1 and J1 = 1.25 at e = 2, the
increase in 1/J for two-fold overexpression is −0.2 for an
increase in 1/e of −0.5. Then, substituting these values
into the equation in Figure 13.18 yields an increase in
1/J of −0.36 for ten-fold overexpression, corresponding
to about a 55% increase in J.
13.3 1 + 0.1(0.5 −1) = 0.95, so about 95% of the homozygote
ﬂux would be expected.

can be, but does not need to be, a ﬂux.If the activity
of E1 is increase by a factor 1 + α (with α ≪1) then
J increases to J(1 + CJ
1α), and similarly for increases of
the activities of E2 and E3. If all three are increased one
after another by the same factor 1 + α then J increases
to J(1 + CJ
1α + CJ
2α + CJ
2α) = J[1 + α(CJ
1 + CJ

2)]. If,
however, the same three enzymes are treated as a block
with control coefﬁcient CJ
123 for the same variable, then
the same modulation would be considered an increase of
J to J(1 + αCJ
123). Comparing the two expressions for the
same modulation it is clear that CJ
123 = CJ
1 + CJ
2 + CJ

More generally, any control coefﬁcient for a block of
enzymes in the sum of the control coefﬁcients for the
same enzymes considered separately.
13.7 A method based on overexpressing rate-limiting en-
zymes can only work if rate-limiting enzymes exist and
remain rate-limiting when their activities are increased.
Metabolic control analysis suggests not only that rate-
limiting enzymes do not exist, but also that the ﬂux
control coefﬁcients of any enzyme will tend to decrease
when its activity in the system is increased. Thus the

13.8 (a) With cooperative feedback inhibition of the ﬁrst en-
zyme and of the branch-point enzymes the ﬂux to one
end-product can be varied almost linearly with the de-
mand for product with almost no effect on the ﬂux in
a competing branch, and with only moderate effects on
metabolite concentrations. (b) If inhibition is maintained
but the cooperativity is suppressed the variation of ﬂux
with demand is somewhat less satisfactory, and the vari-
ations in metabolite concentrations become much larger.
(c) If the feedback inhibition is suppressed completely
the effects on ﬂux control is again worsened, but only
moderately (and only for increased demand; switching
off in response to decreased demand is barely changed),
but variations in metabolite concentrations become enor-
mous.
14.1 The enzyme concentration of 1 mg/ml is 1M/50000 =
20 µM, and that of 5 mg/ml is 100 µM, both of them large
compared with the substrate concentration of 1 µM. The
two relaxations suggest a mechanism as shown in Fig-
ure 14.25, and the simplest assumption to make is that
k−2 = 0. Applying equations 14.11–14.12 (with k−2 = 0)
the sum of relaxation frequencies at 20 µM enzyme is
220 + 11 = 20k1 + k−1 + k2 and the product is 220 × 11 =
20k1k2; the corresponding equations at 100 µM enzyme
are 360 + 34 = 100k1 + k−1 + k2 and 360 × 34 = 100k1k2.
Solving any three of these four equations for the three
rate constants yields k1 = 2 × 106 M−1 · s−1, k2 =
60 s−1, k−1 = 130 s−1. As one equation is unused it
is not necessary to assume that k−2 = 0, but the solution
is more complicated if this assumption is not made.
14.2 The data were calculated from y = 16.37 + 46.3 exp(−t/
3.72) + 29.7 exp(−t/11.41), but the following values
would be typical of the accuracy one could expect to
obtain with the peeling procedure described in Sec-
tion 14.4.2: A = 17, B = 42.5, C = 33.4, τ1 = 3.4 ms,

inhibitor. The different time constants indicate that the
slower process (τ = 15 ms) approximates to the re-
lease of inhibitor from the enzyme–inhibitor complex,
so 1/koff ≈15 ms, koff ≈67 s−1. Hence kon ≈3.3 ×
106 M−1 · s−1. The observation that inhibitor release is
rate-limiting in experiment (b) has no bearing on the
interpretation of Ki as an equilibrium constant, which
follows from the fact that it refers to a dead-end reaction
(see Section 5.7.3).

term has dimensions of v3/a2, whereas the second has
dimensions of v3/a3. One of these must be wrong. Ap-
plying the same analysis to the numerator shows that it
has dimensions of v4a2, so to obtain a complete expres-
sion with dimensions of v the denominator must have
dimensions of v3/a2. So the second denominator term is
likely to be wrong. Note. This logic gives an indication of
where the error is likely to be, not a proof.

distribution-free: K∗
m =1.718 mM, V∗=0.636 mM·min−1.
The trend in the residuals suggests that the enzyme is
subject to substrate inhibition, so that it would be invalid
to draw any conclusions about appropriate weights until
the data have been ﬁtted to an equation more suitable
than the Michaelis–Menten equation. It would also be
desirable to have considerably more than ten observa-
tions.

In the numerator of the expression for ˆV both terms

15.5 No, it implies the opposite. Note ﬁrst that weights v3 for

is to say they assume a variance of about v for v, or a
standard deviation of v0.5: far from being approximately
constant at small values but increasing steeply at high
values, it increases steeply from the origin and tails off
as v increases.

(1) the errors appear to be random with standard devi-

provide no basis for rejecting the ﬁtted model. In experi-
ment (2) one anomalous value is clearly anomalous, and
one should investigate whether a number was entered
into the computer incorrectly. In experiment (3) the error
is principally systematic and not random, and therefore
the Michaelis–Menten model ﬁtted was probably not the
correct one.
