Acknowledgements 
The authors wish to extend sincere thanks to all who facilitated them in the completion of 
this textbook. Our colleagues at the Immunology Departments at Beaumont Hospital, 
St James’s Hospital and at the Department of Medicine University College Cork were 
tremendously supportive in many ways. Practical assistance in the form of reading, print- 
ing, image generation and photography, and circulating interim and final drafts of the book 
material was given by staff at each of the sites. Our colleagues, publishers and reviewers 
offered enthusiastic critical appraisal which we believe has elevated the final version to a 
very high standard and for that we are grateful. MK and PO’L acknowledge the important 
input of EW in relation to the translation of their hand-drawn diagrams into the final 
computer-generated illustrations used throughout the book. Finally, we thank our long- 
suffering family and friends, without whose patience this book may never have seen the 
light of day.

Introduction 
The impetus to write this book came from the many healthcare professionals who asked 
for a book that explained the immune system — ‘but only the bits I really need to know’. 
Immunology impinges on all areas of medicine and therefore all healthcare professionals 
need a working knowledge of clinical immunology. Unfortunately, however, the medical cur- 
riculum is so overloaded that most students have very limited time to devote to each disci- 
pline. This book aims to provide a simple summary of clinical immunology, and to give 
students a framework, to which further knowledge can be added as appropriate. 
The book is divided into four parts, each of which is further divided into many small 
subsections. Part | outlines the workings of the immune system in health and disease. The 
emphasis is on knowledge that is essential to understand immunological disease, investiga- 
tion and management. We aim to include the essentials; for the more interested student, we 
hope that this section will provide a good start. There are many excellent textbooks, which 
provide much more detail on the workings of the immune system, and we would urge you 
to expand your knowledge. 
Part 2 describes the most commonly encountered immunological disorders, including 
allergy, immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, transplantation and lymphoproliferative disor- 
ders. The emphasis is on immunological aspects of disease and we aim to use outlines of 
clinical disease to illustrate several aspects of basic immunology. We hope that this section 
will help to remind students about the workings of the immune system, usually taught at 
an earlier point in the course. For laboratory scientists and other healthcare professionals 
this section should provide a straightforward account of the diseases encountered. 
Part 
3 describes commonly requested immunological 
investigations 
and tests. 
Understanding the indications, methods, interpretation and pitfalls of assays should 
improve the value gained from the Clinical Immunology Laboratory. Laboratory scientists 
will need to consult additional methodological texts, however, we hope that this section 
will provide a useful overview. 
Part 4 describes commonly used immunological therapies. The emphasis is on under- 
standing the effects of these agents on the immune system, as well as practical aspects of 
using these therapies. 
The book is laid out in small sections, and is extensively cross-referenced. This should 
allow readers to dip into the book to clarify a particular aspect of basic immunology, 
clinical immunology, laboratory immunology or treatment of immunological disorders, as 
they arise in daily practice. We have also arranged the sections in logical sequence so that 
readers new to immunology can work through the sections. 
Clinical Immunology is a fascinating clinical science, which impacts on the care of many 
patients. With the advances in our understanding of immunology in the last decade we can 
now explain much more about the workings of the human immune system. While animal 
experiments have generated many ideas and hypotheses, detailed molecular investigation of 
xxiii

XXiV 
patients with immunological disease has provided an understanding of human immunology. 
We now know enough about human immunology to illustrate principles in a clinically 
relevant way. 
Our aim was to write a straightforward, concise clinical immunology text. This of 
course led to the frustration of omitting many fascinating aspects and details of clinical 
immunology. However, we hope that you will gain a useful working knowledge of 
immunology that will encourage you to delve more deeply into the areas of immunology 
relevant to your area of clinical practice.

BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
INTRODUCTION 
This part outlines basic aspects of how the immune system functions to protect us against 
pathogens. Some basic mechanisms underlying allergy and hypersensitivity are also included. 
The aim of this part is to provide a concise summary of essential aspects of immunity required 
to understand immunological diseases, investigations and treatment. There are many excel- 
lent textbooks available, which provide additional detail and more detailed explanation. 
We have, however, aimed to include sections describing clinically relevant aspects of basic 
immunology that are frequently scattered, such as ontogeny of the immune response, as well 
as sections aimed at integrating information.

KEY DEFINITIONS 
Every effort has been made to explain new terms as this part progresses. However 
occasionally, 
particularly 
in the early chapters, 
fully explaining each term was too 
cumbersome. This list is not a complete glossary, merely a list of key definitions with which 
you should be familiar before reading this section. 
Acute phase response (APR) 
Changes in metabolism occurring in response to inflammation, 
including inflammation caused by infection. The APR results in fever and changes in protein 
production. Production of transport proteins (such as albumin) is reduced, while production 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
of protective proteins (immune system molecules, clotting factors and protease inhibitors) 
is increased. Proteins which increase during inflammation are known as acute phase 
reactants or acute phase proteins. 
Antibody 
Immunoglobulin, secreted by plasma cells. Antibodies are key effectors in the 
humoral limb of the adaptive immune response. See Immunoglobulins. 
Antigen 
Originally used to describe any molecule, which could lead to production of an 
antibody (antibody generators). The term antigen now includes any molecule which 
generates an adaptive immune response. Antigens which elicit hypersensitivity or 
allergic responses may be referred to as allergens. 
Antigen presenting cell (APC) A cell capable of presenting antigen to a helper T cell. 
Competent antigen presentation requires expression of Major Histocompatability Complex 
(MHC) Class Il as well as co-stimulatory molecules. Professional APCs are required to 
present antigen to naive T cells, and antigen presentation is the cells primary function (e.g. 
dendritic cells). Non-professional APCs can present antigen to antigen experienced T cells, 
but have other functions in addition to antigen presentation (e.g. macrophages, B cells). 
Chemokine 
A chemical messenger, the primary function of which is to control the 
movement of cells of the immune and haemopoietic systems. 
Cytokine 
A chemical messenger which coordinates a function/functions of the immune 
system. Cytokines usually have highly localised effects. Cytokines may be divided into 
monokines (produced by monocytes/macrophages) or lymphokines (produced by 
lymphocytes). 
Epitope 
The precise portion of an antigen which evokes an immune response. Antigens 
can contain many copies of the same epitope (common in carbohydrate antigens) or 
contain several different epitopes (common in protein antigens). B cells epitopes are 
conformational (i.e. affected by the three-dimensional structure of the antigen), while 
T cell epitopes are short peptides, not affected by antigen conformation. 
Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex 
HLA is the human MHC. The term HLA may 
be used with reference to the chromosome region, the genes or protein molecules. 
Immunoglobulins 
These 
are 
antigen-binding 
molecules 
produced 
by B cells. 
Immunoglobulins may be bound to the surface of the B cell, acting as an antigen 
receptor for the cell, or may be secreted, acting as the effector portion of the humoral 
response. Immunoglobulins (1g) are divided into five functionally distinct major classes; 
IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE. 
Interleukin (IL) 
A general term for cytokines produced by leucocytes. 
Leukotriene 
Family of inflammatory mediators, produced by metabolism of arachidonic acid. 
Lymphocytes 
Cells of the immune system, which are essential for all adaptive immune 
responses. 
Lymphocytes 
are subclassified 
as B lymphocytes (produce antibody 
response), T lymphocytes (produce cellular adaptive response) and Natural Killer or 
NK cells which usually form part of the innate immune response. 
MHC 
Complex of genes which encode surface bound molecules which are involved in 
antigen presentation. The MHC molecules can be divided into Class | molecules, which 
are expressed on all nucleated cells and platelets, and MHC Class Il molecules normally 
only expressed on specialised immune cells which present antigen to helper T cells. The 
human MHC is termed the HLA complex. 
Monokines 
See under cytokines. 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
Opsonin 
A molecule which binds to pathogens or particles to make it more susceptible 
to phagocytosis. 
The process 
of coating 
particles to enhance phagocytosis 
is 
opsonisation. Opsonins include natural opsonins such as mannan binding lectin (MBL) 
and C-reactive protein, complement, as well as antibodies produced as part of the 
adaptive immune response. 
Phagocyte A cell capable of ingesting a particle by phagocytosis, an active process 
involving formation of pseudopodia which engulf the particle. The vesicle so formed in 
the cell is called the phagosome. The principal phagocytes are neutrophils, monocytes 
and macrophages.

Introduction 
WHY DO WE NEED AN IMMUNE SYSTEM? 
We encounter many thousands of microbes every day —- many harmless, many beneficial but 
some that cause disease. The immune system defends us against infections caused by the 
huge variety of microorganisms we encounter, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and 
parasites. Microbes divide rapidly, each division allowing genetic variation and change. 
Thus microbes can change within days or even hours. It takes years for humans to 
reproduce and generate genomic variation. The immune 
system has developed 
elegant mechanisms that facilitate somatic change without genomic variation in response 
to infection and other stimuli. 
THE MAJOR DEFENCE MECHANISMS AGAINST INFECTIONS 
Microorganisms come in all shapes and sizes, with some penetrating into cells and others 
entering the body but remaining outside the cells. Thus the immune system has had 
to develop several different mechanisms to recognise and kill microbes depending on their 
characteristics. From the immune systems point of view, microbes can be divided according 
to type of infection caused. 
Extracellular infection 
¢ 
Bacteria enter tissues but usually remain outside the cells. However, as they are smaller 
than cells of the immune system, specialised immune cells can ingest, kill and digest the 
bacteria. 
* 
Multi-cellular parasites also remain outside cells, however, as they are larger than 
immune cells, they cannot be ingested and so additional immune mechanisms are 
required to fight infection. 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
Intracellular infection 
¢ 
Viruses enter the cytoplasm, hijack the host cells protein synthesis machinery and 
assemble new virus particles, which bud from the cell surface and infect new cells. 
Immune mechanisms which act in the extracellular space are ineffective once virus 
enters the cells. 
¢ 
Intra-vesicular organisms (e.g. Mycobacteria) are taken up into cells but remain within 
vesicles, never entering the cytoplasm. Immune mechanisms that kill virus-infected cells 
are ineffective as the organisms are in a different cell compartment — therefore requir- 
ing an additional immune strategy. 
Infecting organisms must first breach the body’s natural defences (skin, mucous membranes 
etc.). The pathogen then faces the two major types of immune response, the innate immune 
response, and the adaptive or specific immune response. When thinking about how these 
systems work it is helpful to consider (1) the recognition phase where the micro- 
organism/pathogen is recognised as foreign, and (2) the effector phase, which kills the 
organism. 
The innate immune response is immediately available to fight pathogens without the 
requirement for prior exposure to the pathogen. This is the first line of defence against 
pathogens, recognising microbes by the presence of molecular patterns not present on 
mammalian cells. Innate immunity is moderately effective at controlling infection and does 
not improve with repeated exposure to a particular organism. 
The adaptive immune response is refined and expanded after infection, taking several 
days to provide protection on first exposure to a particular pathogen. The cells and 
molecules produced are highly specific for the pathogen. The adaptive immune system 
remembers when a microbe has previously invaded the body resulting in a rapid and 
efficient removal of the pathogen on the second and third time that it invades the body 
(immunological memory). 
Innate and adaptive immunity depend on white blood cells or leucocytes. Innate 
immunity involves granulocytes and macrophages. Adaptive immune responses depend on 
lymphocytes, which provide the lifelong immunity that can follow exposure to disease or 
vaccination. However, the two systems do not operate independently — there are many 
examples of co-operation. Killing of microorganisms by the adaptive immune response 
frequently depends upon linking antigen-specific recognition to activation of effector 
mechanisms that are also used in the innate response. 
Together, the innate and adaptive immune systems provide an amazing defence system. 
Despite the fact that we are surrounded by a multitude of potentially pathogenic micro- 
organisms, we rarely succumb to infection. Many infections are eliminated by the innate 
immune system and cause no disease. Infections that cannot be resolved by innate 
immunity trigger adaptive immunity, which usually eliminates the infection (often before 
we are aware of it) and generates immunological memory. 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM GOES WRONG? 
The immune system is only apparent when it goes wrong, and virtually any clinical 
presentation may be the sign of an underlying immunological disorder. The immune system 
must find a balance between producing a life-saving response to infection and tissue- 
damaging reactions. 
It is also essential 
that the immune system only mounts 
a 
vigorous response to pathogens that pose a threat, and ignores our own tissues, as well as 
environmental substances including foods and medicines. 
INTRODUCTION 
Immunodeficiency diseases 
Immunodeficiency means a failure of the immune system to protect us from infection. It 
may be primary (due to an intrinsic defect in the immune system) or secondary, (due to 
drugs, infection, malnutrition etc.). 
Overactivity of part of the immune system 
The immune response can cause incidental tissue damage as well as the intended removal 
and/or destruction of microorganisms. Additionally the immune system may fail to 
distinguish between pathogens and innocuous stimuli such as pollen or self-tissue. In this 
case a vigorous immune response causes disease. 
Allergy 
An over-response to environmental stimuli, which pose no threat, is called allergy. Several 
different immune mechanisms may be involved. The most common mechanism causes 
rapid responses varying in severity from hayfever to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. 
Autoimmunity 
Autoimmune diseases can affect any tissue in the body, and occur when the immune system 
fails to distinguish between self (which should be ignored) and non-self (which should be 
attacked). Many autoimmune diseases can be diagnosed by testing for immune products 
(antibodies) against self-tissues in patients’ blood. 
Transplantation 
Transplantation involves transfer of cells, tissues or solid organs from one person to 
another. As the transplanted tissue is seen as non-self, the immune system attempts to 
eliminate it. Powerful immunosuppression has been required to make clinical transplan- 
tation a reality. Transplantation of bone marrow, kidney, pancreas, liver, heart and lung are 
now routine treatments for irreversible organ failure. 
VACCINATION 
Vaccination is one of the great success stories of immunology. By generating an adaptive 
immune response that leads to immunological memory, people can be protected from 
severe disease. Vaccination has led to the eradication of smallpox, and the World Health 
Organization aims to eradicate poliomyelitis in the near future. The incidence of many 
severe infectious diseases has been hugely reduced by vaccination campaigns. 
Clinical immunology is the specialty that focuses on diagnosis and treatment of immune 
mediated disease. An understanding of the immune system and how it works is essential for 
treating patients with these disorders. However, immunological disorders impinge on all 
medical specialties to a greater or lesser degree. Thus all healthcare professionals require 
some understanding of basic and clinical immunology. 
Overview of Defence 
Mechanisms 
THE DEFENCE SYSTEMS OF THE BODY FALL 
INTO THREE CATEGORIES 
@ 
Non-immunological external defences 
¢ 
Innate immunity 
* 
Adaptive immunity. 
The principle difference between innate and adaptive immune responses is in pathogen 
recognition. Many effector mechanisms used to kill pathogens are shared by both systems. 
_ NON-IMMUNOLOGICAL EXTERNAL DEFENCES 
Skin and mucus membranes form physical barriers to infectious organisms. When breached 
(e.g. burn victims) infection is common despite normal immune function. Pathogens must 
attach to epithelial cells and migrate through the epithelium to establish infection. Surface 
epithelia provide mechanical, chemical and microbiological barriers as a first line of defence 
against infection (Figure 1.2.1). 
Mechanical barriers prevent microbial attachment and include 
¢ 
Flow of secretions across epithelium — when flow is obstructed infection is common. 
* 
Mucociliary elevator. Inhaled organisms are trapped by mucus, which is moved by the 
coordinated action of cilia on the surface of ciliated epithelium. In the respiratory tract, 
mucus and organisms are moved to the oropharynx and swallowed or expectorated. 
Chemical barriers 
Chemical 
barriers 
include 
the acid environment 
in the stomach, 
together with 
digestive enzymes and the antimicrobial effect of lysozyme found in tears and sweat, as well 
as defensins (bactericidal peptides found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts).

Commensal flora, found on skin and mucosal membranes, form a microbial barrier by 
competing for nutrients and attachment sites on cells. Some also produce anti-bacterial 
substances. 
INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES 
When microorganisms penetrate epithelial surfaces they are usually killed by the innate 
immune response (Figure 1.2.2). Innate immunity acts immediately, recognises broad 
microbial patterns rather than unique specificities and does not produce immunological 
memory. 
Macrophages and neutrophils have surface receptors that recognise and bind common 
constituents of many bacteria. Binding induces engulfment, killing and degradation of 
bacteria — termed phagocytosis. 
Following phagocytosis, activated macrophages secrete chemical messengers (cytokines), 
which initiate inflammation. Inflammation increases blood vessel permeability, rapidly

increasing delivery of cells and proteins of the immune system to the infected area. Activation 
of complement, a system of plasma proteins, generates fragments that coat or opsonise 
bacteria increasing the efficiency of phagocytes. Complement also lyses some bacteria, and 
releases small pro-inflammatory peptides. 
Macrophage activation results in cytokine release, causing a rise in body temperature and 
an acute phase response. Acute phase proteins are produced in the liver and contribute to 
inflammation and host defence. 
NK cells recognise and kill virus-infected cells. NK cells are activated by cytokines 
(TNF-a and IL-12) produced by macrophages. Virus infected cells produce interferon-a and 
B (IFN-a and 8), which inhibit viral replication within cells, make surrounding cells more 
resistant to viral entry, and also activate NK cells. 
The innate immune response makes a crucial 
contribution to activation of adaptive immunity

OVERVIEW OF DEFENCE MECHANISMS 
ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSES 
Figure 
Adaptive immunity provides protection when innate immunity fails to eliminate infection. 
Adaptive immunity develops slowly, has unique specificity for antigen and produces 
immunological memory (Figure 1.2.3). 
Adaptive immunity 
results 
in selection 
of lymphocyte 
clones 
bearing 
highly 
antigen-specific receptors (recognition molecules). Each lymphocyte expresses cell-surface 
receptors of a single specificity. B cell receptors (immunoglobulins) bind extracellular mole- 
cules and pathogens, while T cell receptors (TCR) bind peptide fragments bound to MHC 
molecules on cell surfaces. 
Following 
initiation 
of an immune 
response, 
the antigen-specific lymphocyte(s) 
proliferate and its progeny differentiate into effector cells that can eliminate the pathogen. 
A subset of these proliferating lymphocytes differentiates into memory cells capable of 
responding rapidly if the same pathogen is encountered again. 
Adaptive immunity can be divided into humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and 
cell-mediated immunity. Both types of immune response require activation of helper T cells 
(TH), a pivotal lymphocyte subset that are essential for the development of effective 
adaptive immune responses.

B cells differentiate into plasma cells that make antibody, or secreted immunoglobulin. 
Antibodies bind extracellular pathogens or toxins, bringing about their destruction. This is 
termed humoral immunity. 
Cell-mediated immunity provides protection against intracellular pathogens. Antigen- 
specific cytotoxic T cells kill virally infected cells in an attempt to eliminate the virus. Another 
T cell subset (helper T cells) activates macrophages to kill microorganisms that reside within 
intracellular vesicles. Both mechanisms are included in the term cell-mediated immunity. 
The features of innate and adaptive immunity are summarised in Table 1.2.1. 
INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY SHARE 
SOME EFFECTOR MECHANISMS 
12 
The effector functions of antibody depend on recruiting cells and molecules of the 
innate immune system. Antibodies target pathogens and their toxic products for disposal by 
phagocytes. 
¢ 
Antibodies bind and neutralise bacterial toxins. 
¢ 
Antibodies opsonise 
bacteria, 
facilitating their ingestion and destruction 
by 
macrophages or neutrophils. 
¢ 
Antibodies activate complement, which can lyse bacteria or opsonise microbes. 
Macrophages become more effective at killing organisms after interaction with helper T cells.

Cells and Organs of the 
Immune System 
Cells of the immune system originate in the bone marrow. Once mature these cells patrol 
tissues, circulating in blood and lymphatic vessels. Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) found 
mainly in the bone marrow give rise to all blood cells and cells of the immune system. HSCs 
differentiate into both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors (Figure 1.3.1). 
MYELOID CELLS 
Myeloid cells are involved in innate and adaptive immunity. They include granulocytes 
(neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils), monocytes and macrophages, dendritic cells and mast 
cells. 
Granulocytes 
Granulocytes have densely staining cytoplasmic granules and have multilobed nuclei (hence 
also known as polymorphonuclear leucocytes or PMNs). 
Neutrophils are short-lived, mobile phagocytes, which circulate in the bloodstream until 
recruited to sites of inflammation. They are the most numerous cells of the innate immune 
response, but also interact with antibodies playing an effector role in adaptive responses. 
Eosinophils play a role in defence against parasitic infections and are also recruited to sites 
of allergic inflammation. The function of basophils is uncertain. 
Monocytes and macrophages 
Monocytes circulate in the blood, migrate into tissues and differentiate into macrophages. 
Macrophages are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system (previously known as the 
reticuloendothelial system) and are distributed widely in body tissues. Macrophages play

Dendritic cells 
Dendritic cells are professional APCs, which migrate from blood into tissues. On encoun- 
tering a pathogen, dendritic cells ingest antigen by phagocytosis, mature and migrate to 
lymph nodes where they present antigen to T cells and activate T cells. 
Mast cells 
Mast cells are found in connective tissue and close to mucosal surfaces. They trigger local 
inflammatory responses to antigen by rapidly releasing inflammatory mediators including 
histamine. Mast cells play a pivotal role in allergic responses.

CELLS AND ORGANS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM 
LYMPHOID CELLS 
The common lymphoid precursor matures into lymphocytes, including B and T cells which 
generate adaptive immune responses. 
B cells and T cells 
B cells develop in the bone marrow. T cell precursors leave the bone marrow and mature 
in the thymus. B and T lymphocytes cannot be distinguished morphologically — both are 
small cells with condensed chromatin and few cytoplasmic organelles. B and T lymphocytes 
can be distinguished by assessing expression of lineage-specific molecules (see Section 3.3). 
Mature B and T cells circulate between the blood and peripheral lymphoid tissues. 
Encounter with antigen triggers proliferation and differentiation into cells with specialised 
effector functions. Both B and T cells have a large repertoire of receptors that can recognise 
a wide diversity of antigens. 
Plasma cells 
B cells mature into plasma cells, terminally differentiated cells which secrete antibody. 
NK cells 
NK cells are large granular lymphocytes found throughout the tissues of the body but 
predominantly in the circulation. They lack antigen-specific receptors and are part of the 
innate immune system. NK cells kill tumour cells and virus-infected cells. 
LYMPHOID ORGANS 
Lymphoid organs are specialised tissues where lymphocytes develop, mature and differentiate. 
They are divided into primary lymphoid organs, where lymphocytes develop, and secondary 
lymphoid organs, where adaptive immune responses are initiated (Figure 1.3.2). 
Primary lymphoid organs — bone marrow and thymus 
B and T cells originate in the bone marrow but only B cells mature here (bone marrow 
derived). T cells migrate to the thymus for maturation (thymus derived). Once maturation 
is complete, both types of cells enter the bloodstream and migrate to the peripheral 
lymphoid organs. 
Secondary lymphoid organs 
Secondary lymphoid organs are organised to trap antigen from sites of infection, facilitate 
antigen presentation to lymphocytes and provide the optimal microenvironment for lym- 
phocyte maturation. They include lymph nodes, spleen and mucosa-associated lymphoid 
tissue (MALT) and all share the same basic structure. Immune responses are initiated in 
secondary lymphoid tissues. 
Lymph nodes 
Lymph nodes trap antigens from sites of infection in tissue (Figure 1.3.3). Afferent 
lymphatic vessels transport extracellular tissue fluid (lymph) carrying antigen and APCs to

the lymph nodes. In lymph nodes, B cells are concentrated in follicles and T cells are 
distributed in the surrounding paracortical area (T cell zone). When B cells encounter their 
specific antigen and antigen-specific helper T cells, they proliferate in germinal centres of 
the follicles. The organisation of lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid tissues 
promotes B cell interaction with helper T cells, which is essential for antibody responses. 
Spleen 
The spleen collects antigens from the blood. The main bulk of the spleen is red pulp, the 
site of red blood cell (RBC) disposal. Lymphocytes surround arterioles entering the spleen 
forming areas of white pulp, which are divided into the peri-arteriolar lymphoid sheath 
(PALS), containing mostly T cells, and the B cell corona. Lymphocytes and antigen-loaded 
dendritic cells come together in the PALS. 
Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue 
MALT includes the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), bronchial-associated lymphoid 
tissue (BALT) and aggregates of lymphocytes in other mucosae. GALT collects antigen from 
the epithelial surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and includes the tonsils, adenoids, 
appendix and specialised structures called Peyers patches in the small intestine.

LYMPHOCYTE TRAFFICKING 
Lymphocytes express adhesion molecules, with which they attach to endothelial cells prior 
to migrating into tissues or lymphoid organs. Some lymphocytes have specific adhesion 
molecules (addressins), which bind to ligands on endothelial cells in particular vascular 
beds, for example, mucosal lymphocytes express addressins which favour migration into 
MALT. 
Naive T and B cells are mature lymphocytes that have not yet encountered antigen. These 
cells continually migrate into the secondary lymphoid tissues via the bloodstream. They 
return to the blood via the (efferent) lymphatic vessels and the thoracic duct. Naive 
lymphocytes recirculate until they meet their cognate antigen. If this does not occur 
they die. 
When pathogens enter the body, APCs (e.g. dendritic cells) take up and process antigen. 
APCs and free antigen are carried in afferent lymphatics to regional lymph nodes. Here 
APCs display processed antigen to recirculating T lymphocytes, activating antigen-specific 
cells. Activated T cells proliferate and differentiate into antigen-specific effector cells and 
leave the lymph node via efferent lymphatics, re-enter the blood stream and migrate to the 
site of infection. 
Recirculating B cells that encounter antigen are activated, proliferate and differentiate into 
antibody-secreting plasma cells. Plasma cells may remain in the lymph node or return to the 
bone marrow (via efferent lymphatics and bloodstream). 
All secondary lymphoid tissues trap APCs and antigen, present 
it to migratory 
lymphocytes thus stimulating an adaptive immune response. B cell follicles of the 
lymph nodes expand and proliferate to form germinal centres and the entire lymph node 
enlarges — giving rise to swollen glands. 
17 
Innate Immune Responses | 
The innate immune response detects organisms using pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), 
which recognise molecules present on microorganisms, but absent from mammalian cells. 
There is a limited repertoire of PRMs, and they do not vary during the course of the immune 
response. The innate immune response is capable of mounting a rapid response to an invading 
microbe and frequently augments the adaptive immune response. 
Components of the innate immune response include: 
* 
Cells 
— 
Phagocytes (neutrophils and macrophages) 
— 
Degranulating cells (mast cells and eosinophils) 
— 
NK cells 
* 
Proteins

Interferons (IFNs) 
This section will focus on phagocytosis and natural opsonins, which play a role in the innate 
immune response to bacteria, and NK cells and IFNs, which are the principle innate defences 
against viral pathogens. The next two sections describe other aspects of the innate response. 
PHAGOCYTES AND PHAGOCYTOSIS 
Neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages are all phagocytic cells. Macrophages may 
develop special phenotypes depending on their location. At sites of inflammation they

may become giant cells and epitheloid cells. Fixed macrophages are found in the sinusoids 
of the liver and spleen and remove particulate and antibody coated matter from the blood. 
Specialised macrophages are found in bone (osteoclasts), brain (glial cells) and lungs 
(alveolar macrophages). 
Phagocytosis is the process whereby these cells ingest particulate matter, including 
pathogens and cellular debris (Figure 1.4.1). Phagocytic cells recognise debris using 
PRMs or receptors that bind complement, immunoglobulin or other opsonins. Engagement 
of receptors on the phagocyte’s surface induces formation of pseudopodia, which surround 
and engulf particles. The ingested particle is contained in a vesicle called a phagosome. 
Fusion with lysosomes forms phagolysosomes resulting in acidification of the phagosome 
and release of proteases, and ultimately microbial 
killing and digestion. Phagocyte 
activation results in increased oxygen consumption termed the respiratory burst, associ- 
ated with production of toxic reactive oxygen intermediates 
(superoxide, hydrogen 
peroxide). 
Phagocytosis can result from engagement of PRMs on phagocytes in the absence of 
opsonins. However, the process is more efficient in the presence of opsonins including 
immunoglobulin, which binds to Fe receptors or complement, which engages complement 
receptors on phagocytes. Natural opsonins do not require activation to acquire activity, 
behaving as soluble PRMs binding to microbe-specific molecular signatures. These include 
MBL, which binds mannan residues, a type of carbohydrate not expressed by mammalian 
cells. CRP is a protein produced in large amounts during episodes of inflammation, and 
widely measured clinically as a marker of inflammation. It binds to C protein, found on 
Streptococci, opsonising this group of organisms. 
INNATE IMMUNITY TO VIRAL INFECTIONS — INTERFERONS 
Interferons (IFNs) are divided into Type I IFNs (IFN-a and 8) and Type II IFN (IFN-y). 
Type I IFNs are produced by many cells following viral infection. In contrast, IFN-y is 
only produced by selected immune cells including some helper T (TH1) cells and NK cells. 
Type I IFN production is induced by the double-stranded RNA generated by viruses, but 
not normally present in mammalian cells. Interferon is produced within hours of infection. 
19 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
Protective effects of IFN include: 
Inhibition of viral replication within the infected cell 
Rendering neighbouring cells more resistant to viral entry 
NK cell activation 
Upregulation of viral peptide processing, which bind to MHC Class I molecules. This 
alerts the adaptive immune response that the cell is infected by a virus. 
¢¢ 
¢ 
¢ 
IFN-y has little direct antiviral activity but has potent immunostimulatory actions. Actions 
of IFN-y will be described in more detail when T cell function is considered. However NK 
cells can also produce IFN-y. 
INNATE IMMUNITY TO VIRAL INFECTIONS — NK CELLS 
NK cells are large granular lymphocytes that constitute about 10% of lymphocytes. They 
do not rearrange antigen receptor molecules, in contrast to B and T lymphocytes. NK cells 
can 
kill without activation by cytokines, but they proliferate 
in response 
to IL-2 
and become more effective at killing infected cells in the presence of Type I IFNs, IL-12 and 
IFN-y. 
NK cells detect virus-infected cells or tumour cells through a complex system of recep- 
tors, some delivering negative and some positive signals. Positive signals stimulate NK cells 
to kill and they originate from binding abnormal PRMs on infected cells. However, if the 
cell expresses adequate amounts of MHC Class I, the NK cell receives a negative signal 
through killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs). This negative signal may override the positive 
signal to the NK cell — however, an MHC Class I bearing infected cell will later be killed 
by cytotoxic T cells. Some virally infected cells and tumour cells downregulate MHC

Class I, as a mechanism to evade cytotoxic T cells. However, this strategy may result in 
killing by NK cells. 
NK cells also have Fe receptors and bind to antibody-coated target cells. This activates 
the NK cell, resulting in target cell killing. This is called antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
NK cells kill target cells in two ways that are similar to the mechanisms used by cyto- 
toxic T cells (Figure 1.4.2). NK cells express Fas ligand (FasL) and thus can bind Fas on 
target cells inducing programmed cell death or apoptosis in the target cell. Alternatively, 
NK cells can insert pores into target cells, using perforin. Perforin forms pores by poly- 
merising on the target cell surface. These pores allow granzymes (proteolytic enzymes) 
enter the target cell where they degrade host cell proteins. Pores also render the cell sus- 
ceptible to osmotic lysis. The action of perforin and granzymes can result in apoptosis or 
necrosis of the target cell. 
In addition to killing target cells, NK cells secrete cytokines including y-IFN, biasing 
subsequent adaptive responses towards a cellular immune response, which is the effector 
mechanism required for recovery from viral infections.

Immune Responses to Infection 
21 
Innate Immune Responses II — 
The Complement System 
The complement system is part of the innate immune system and includes over 20 
functionally linked soluble plasma proteins. Complement components are acute phase 
proteins synthesised in the liver (hepatocytes) and by monocytes. 
Like other acute 
phase proteins, synthesis is increased after injury or during inflammation. Activation of com- 
plement generates molecules and complexes, important both in defence against bacterial 
infection and removal of circulating and deposited immune complexes (antibody-antigen). 
Complement circulates in inactive precursor forms and is activated in a cascade fashion. This 
is local, occurring on cell membranes or antigen-antibody complexes. 
COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION 
22 
Complement activation can occur via three different pathways: 
* 
Classical pathway 
* 
Lectin pathway 
¢ 
Alternative pathway. 
The classical pathway (including complement components C1, C4, C2) is activated by 
antibodies bound to antigen (immune complexes). The lectin pathway (MBL, C4, C2) is 
activated by mannan-containing carbohydrates on bacteria or viruses. The alternative path- 
way (C3, factor B, factor D properdin) is constitutively minimally active, but is strongly 
activated when a transiently active complement component binds to polysaccharides on 
a pathogen. The alternative and mannan binding lectin pathways do not require antibody 
and therefore represent an early defence against microbial infection. Antibody activation of 
the classical pathway illustrates how the adaptive immune response harnesses elements of 
the innate immune response to augment effector responses. 
C3 is the central component of the complement system. The first critical step in each 
pathway involves the generation of an enzyme (‘C3 convertase’) that splits the C3 molecule 
into C3a and C3b, the biologically active forms of C3. The next step involves the

generation of another enzyme (‘C5 convertase’) that splits C5 into C5a and C5b, the

generating the cytolytic membrane attack complex (MAC). An overview of these three 
pathways and their components is found in Figure 1.5.1. 
THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEMENT 
Host defence against infection and foreign antigens 
Opsonisation 
C3b coats or opsonises bacteria. Phagocytosis is promoted and enhanced 
when C3b binds complement receptor 1 (CR1) expressed on neutrophils and macrophages. 
Chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils 
CSa attracts neutrophils and monocytes to the 
site of microbial infection or foreign antigen. C5a also augments cell adhesion, degran- 
ulation and activation of the respiratory burst in these cells. 
Inflammation and vascular responses 
The inflammatory peptides C3a and C5a (known as 
anaphylatoxins) activate mast cells resulting in histamine release. Histamine increases 
vascular permeability enhancing delivery of cells and proteins of the immune system. 
Lysis of bacteria and cells 
The MAC is formed by CSb-C9. This complex forms small 
pores that puncture cell membranes and cause cell death by lysis. 
Solubilisation and phagocytic clearance of immune complexes 
Immune complexes (ICs) form when the host mounts a vigorous antibody response to an 
abundant circulating antigen. Immune complexes are potentially harmful if deposited in 
vessel walls as they lead to inflammatory reactions that damage the surrounding tissue. 
23 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
Complement affects immune complexes in two ways: 
Solubilisation 
Complement activation on immunoglobulin molecules inhibits immune 
complex 
growth 
by destabilising 
complex-forming 
reactions 
between 
adjacent 
immunoglobulin molecules. 
Phagocytic clearance 
Immune complexes bind and activate complement. C3b-coated 
immune complexes bind to CR1 that is expressed on red blood cells. Phagocytes in the liver 
and spleen strip and clear RBC-bound immune complexes. 
REGULATION OF COMPLEMENT 
The complement system is a potent mediator of inflammation and is tightly regulated to 
prevent injury to host cells. Complement cascades are tightly regulated at multiple steps: 
activated complement components are highly labile with short half-lives. This limits the 
range of destructive activity close to the activation site. Fluid phase inhibitors including C1- 
Inhibitor, Factor H, Factor I, C4-binding protein and membrane proteins including CR1, 
membrane cofactor protein, decay accelerating factor, and CD59, also play important reg- 
ulatory roles. Most membrane regulatory proteins are expressed on host cells but not on 
microbes thus limiting the effects of complement activation to invading microorganisms.

Innate Immune Responses III — 
Other Soluble Factors 
THE ACUTE PHASE RESPONSE (APR) 
Dramatic changes 
in vasculature, 
metabolism, temperature 
and plasma protein 
composition occur in response to tissue damage. Anti-microbial activity is enhanced. 
Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a) released by phagocytes are the dominant 
mediators of these effects. Effects occur within hours and contribute to protection before 
and during the adaptive immune response. Adverse 
effects occur 
if the APR is 
inappropriately exaggerated or prolonged (Figure 1.6.1). 
Key features include: 
@ 
Fever — inflammatory cytokines re-set hypothalamic temperature control. Microbial 
growth is impaired and specific immunity is more efficient at higher temperatures. 
¢ 
Increased metabolism 
— release of energy from muscle and fat stores increases 
temperature. Weight loss is common. 
¢ 
Vascular changes 
- TNF-a increases vascular permeability, facilitating movement of 
inflammatory cells and molecules into damaged tissue. Procoagulant effects localise 
inflammation at sites of injury. 
During the APR the concentrations of many plasma proteins are altered — known as acute 
phase reactants. Some have anti-microbial properties. 
Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce increased liver cell synthesis of the following proteins: 
CRP — natural opsonin 
MBL — natural opsonin 
Complement proteins (C3, C4) 
Ferritin — reduces levels of free iron which impedes some microbial growth 
Fibrinogen — procoagulant effects.

Reduced production of other proteins occurs in the APR: 
¢ 
Albumin - hypoalbuminaemia can be pronounced in inflammatory states. 
¢ 
Transferrin — like ferritin, reduces iron required for microbial growth. 
The net effect is to shift hepatic protein synthesis towards production of protective proteins 
and away from storage and transport proteins. Elevation of plasma proteins, especially 
fibrinogen and immunoglobulins, increases the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) in 
inflammatory states. Measurement of CRP is commonly used to monitor inflammation. 
Distinct patterns of plasma protein variations occur 
in different conditions. This is 
discussed further in Section 3.9. 
CYTOKINES 
Cytokines are small soluble proteins produced by cells (mainly of immune origin) that alter 
behaviour of that cell itself or of other cells. 
26 
INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES 
III 
Cytokines are categorised according to the cell of origin into: 
e 
5 
Sd 
Interleukins (IL) — produced by blood cells and primarily influence leucocytes 
Lymphokines — produced by activated lymphocytes 
Monokines — produced by activated mononuclear phagocytes. 
Common structural features allow cytokines to be classified into distinct families: 
¢¢¢ 
¢ 
Interferons — IFN-a and £, IFN-y 
Chemokines — IL-8, RANTES etc. 
TNF family — TNF-a and 8 
Haemopoietins — IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), 
granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-3, IL-7. 
Cytokines exert their effects through interaction with cytokine receptors on cell surfaces, 
and often use common signaling pathways within cells. Families of structurally related 
receptors interact with families of cytokines (above). 
Cytokines can 
also be categorised according 
to the major effector functions they 
mediate. 
¢ 
Innate immune response cytokines — initiate early immune responses. They also influ- 
ence the type of subsequent specific immune response. 
* 
Regulation of lymphocyte function — cytokines induce, direct and regulate lymphocytic 
responses. 
¢ 
Inflammatory 
cell activation 
— 
mediate 
effector functions of macrophages and 
lymphocytes. 
* 
Regulation of cell movement — chemokines are a distinct group of cytokines that share 
structural and functional characteristics. Chemokines are secreted by many cell types 
and influence the movement of immune cells. 
¢ 
Haemopoietic growth factors 
—- 
a number of cytokines influence haemopoietic 
differentiation. 
Cytokines have a multitude of effects, but a number of features are common: 
Short duration of action — half-life is short and degradation is rapid. 
Locally active 
— 
most work on 
the cell of origin or on 
cells in the local 
microenvironment only. Others, like the haemopoietic factors and TNF-a act on 
distant cells. 
Multiple effects — most cytokines have many rather than one action (e.g. TNF-a - 
neutrophil activation, vascular effects, hepatic effects). Cytokine concentration also 
influences the pattern of the response. 
Overlapping 
effects 
- 
the same 
effect 
can 
be mediated 
by a number 
of 
cytokines (e.g. pro-inflammatory effects of IL-1 and TNF-a). This is an obstacle to the 
development of cytokine-directed therapies universally effective 
in inflammatory 
diseases. 
All these factors make measurement of circulating cytokines both difficult and of dubious 
relevance in most situations. 
Table 1.6.1 is not a complete list of all known cytokines but, rather highlights well- 
documented effects of some cytokines with critical roles in the induction, direction and 
regulation of inflammatory and immune responses.

Inflammation 
Inflammation is the reaction of living tissue to injury or infection, and may be acute or 
chronic. Acute inflammation may be followed by resolution, or if the stimulus persists may 
become chronic (Figure 1.7.1). Clinically, acute inflammation is characterised by heat, 
redness, swelling and pain and often loss of function. 
Inflammation has many beneficial functions including: 
Dilutes and removes toxins 
Limits spread of bacteria 
Facilitates influx of neutrophils, complement, opsonins and antibodies 
Provides a supply of inflammatory mediators 
Ensures an increased supply of nutrients for cells 
Promotes initiation of the immune response 
Initiates the healing process. 
¢¢e¢

OO 
However acute inflammation also has harmful effects. Swelling may have a mechanical 
effect — for example, in acute epiglottitis where the airway may become obstructed by the 
swollen epiglottis. Swelling can impair function directly or by impairing blood flow, 
particularly when tissue expansion 
is limited 
(e.g. in intracranial inflammation). 
Inflammation also contributes to tissue damage. When acute inflammation fails to resolve, 
chronic inflammation can cause considerable tissue damage, which may result in scarring 
and loss of tissue function. 
INITIATION OF INFLAMMATION 
Inflammation 
results from 
a variety 
of insults, which 
lead 
to production 
of 
pro-inflammatory mediators. The nature 
of these mediators 
affects the nature 
of 
the inflammatory response. The type and severity of the injury and the genetic makeup 
of the individual affect inflammation.

Components of the innate and adaptive immune response play pivotal roles in the 
inflammatory process. 
THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE 
Injury damages 
cells resulting 
in release 
of proinflammatory mediators such 
as 
prostaglandins and leukotrienes and leakage of cell contents. Bacterial components and 
toxins provide additional proinflammatory stimuli. Mast cell degranulation results from 
physical trauma and complement activation, releasing histamine. Tissue macrophages 
ingest particles and debris, become activated and release 
a number of proinflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a. Macrophages also produce chemokines, which 
attract specific leucocytes to the site of injury. 
Prostaglandins, histamine and complement components (particularly the anaphylatox- 
ins C3a and CS5a) cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. This increases 
extravasation of fluid, including macromolecules, which do not cross a normal vascular bed. 
Monokines also alter vascular endothelium locally, making it more ‘sticky’ by upregulating 
adhesion molecules, and increasing expression of procoagulant molecules. Enhanced clot- 
ting in local vessels helps to stop bleeding and also limits the ability of bacteria to spread.

Leucocytes migrate to the area of inflammation, with neutrophils arriving rapidly, 
followed by monocytes and lymphocytes hours to days afterwards. Leucocytes normally 
travel in the centre of vessels, due to laminar flow. Leucocytes make contact with endothe- 
lium intermittently, rolling for some distance, and then detaching if no further adherent 
stimuli are encountered. If the rolling leucocyte encounters inflamed endothelium expressing 
activated integrin adhesion molecules, integrin-mediated firm adhesion ensues (tight bind- 
ing). The leucocyte can then migrate through the endothelium, via the interaction of 
additional adhesion molecule pairs (diapedesis). Leucocytes reach the site of tissue injury 
by chemotaxis (directional cell migration) along gradients of chemotactic mediators. 
Chemotactic mediators which attract neutrophils include anaphylatoxins, leukotrienes, 
chemokines such as IL-8 (produced by macrophages) and bacterial products, particularly 
formyl! peptides (Figure 1.7.2). 
The precise composition of the inflammatory infiltrate is influenced by the initiating 
stimulus. Suppurative inflammation 
is commonly seen in response to infection with 
pyogenic bacteria. The inflammatory infiltrate is neutrophil dominated, and pus formation 
may result. Pus is a semi-liquid mixture containing bacteria, damaged cells and neutrophils. 
It is green because of the high content of neutrophil myeloperoxidase. A localised collection 
of pus is called an abscess. Allergic inflammation is discussed in detail in Section 1.30. 
However, mast cell degranulation plays a key role in initiating this type of inflammation, 
and the early phase is dominated by tissue oedema with a later influx of eosinophils. Pus 
formation does not occur. 
Later in the course of inflammation monocytes and lymphocytes enter, attracted by 
chemokines released from macrophages and other cells in the inflammatory infiltrate. 
If the stimulus is removed or eradicated acute inflammation may resolve, often leaving 
no tissue injury. Once the stimulus is removed, the rate of arrival of new cells decreases 
rapidly. Leucocytes present at the inflammatory site die by apoptosis and are removed by 
resident macrophages. Fibroblasts repair the connective tissue, and breaches in epithelium 
heal. 
The physiological and cellular events underlying inflammation give rise to the clinical 
features outlined in Table 1.7.1. 
Acute inflammation enhances antigen presentation to the immune system, eliciting 
an immune 
response 
to infecting organisms. APCs including dendritic 
cells and 
macrophages at the site of inflammation take up antigen and become activated. These

INFLAMMATION 
APCs then migrate to regional lymph nodes where the chances of encountering antigen 
specific T and B cells are substantially increased. In the local nodes lymphocyte prolifera- 
tion and differentiation occurs. Activated T cells then migrate back to the tissues, while B 
cells mature into plasma cells and produce antibody in the lymph nodes or bone marrow. 
CHRONIC INFLAMMATION 
Chronic inflammation usually follows unresolved acute inflammation, usually because of 
persistence of infection, allergen or other stimulus. Occasionally chronic inflammation can 
occur without preceding acute inflammation in some types of autoimmune disease. Chronic 
inflammation is characterised by ongoing tissue damage occurring at the same time as 
healing and repair (Figure 1.7.3). 
Chronic inflammation is usually associated with impairment of function. Resolution is 
usually associated with fibrosis and scarring. When chronic inflammation cannot be fully 
controlled, progressive fibrosis may occur in association with progressive loss of organ 
function. 
GRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION 
Granulomatous inflammation is a special type of chronic inflammation associated with 
intense macrophage activation, driven by IFN-y producing helper T cells. 
Macrophages differentiate into epithelioid cells with enhanced secretory function, and 
diminished phagocytic capacity. Epithelioid cells fuse into multi-nucleated giant cells. This 
collection 
of epithelioid 
cells, giant cells and lymphocytes 
is called 
a granuloma 
(Figure 1.7.3). Granulomatous inflammation is associated with infections with organisms 
such 
as Mycobacteria, 
Treponema pallidum 
(which causes 
syphilis) 
and fungi. 
Granulomatous inflammation also occurs around foreign bodies, in some autoimmune 
disorders and idiopathic conditions such as sarcoidosis.

What the Immune System 
Recognises 
ANTIGENS 
The term antigen originally described any substance that could induce antibody formation. 
Antigens include proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids. Following characterisa- 
tion of the cellular immune response, the use of the term antigen was expanded to include 
any substance that activated the immune response. Autoantigens are molecules found on 
host tissues that can induce an immune response. 
Antigenic determinants and epitopes 
Antibodies or lymphocytes produced in response to an antigen are directed against specific 
parts of the molecule called antigenic determinants or epitopes and not against the whole 
molecule. Epitopes are the smallest unit of antigens which can elicit an immune response. 
One molecule may have several identical or different epitopes, for example, a carbohydrate 
with repeating sugar units has several identical epitopes, while a large single chain protein 
has many different antigenic epitopes. 
Conformational and linear epitopes 
- 
Antibodies usually bind conformational epitopes dependent on folding of the molecule 
(tertiary structure). Molecular folding brings different parts of a linear peptide chain close 
together, forming a single, discontinuous epitope. Many antibodies bind conformational 
epitopes in native proteins, but will not bind the denatured unfolded molecule. In contrast, 
T cell receptors recognise linear epitopes arising from the linear amino acid sequences of 
peptide antigens (primary structure) (Figure 1.8.1). 
Haptens 
Haptens are small molecules that can bind antibody but are incapable of inducing an 
adaptive immune response alone. Haptens must bind carrier molecules to elicit antibody

and T cell responses. Haptens such as drugs may elicit responses when bound to host 
proteins and anti-hapten antibodies may mediate allergic drug reactions. 
IMMUNOGENICITY 
Molecules that can stimulate an adaptive immune response are said to be immunogenic 
and can also be called immunogens. Factors other than antigen characteristics influence 
immunogenicity (Table 1.8.1). Substances that improve an immune response to antigens 
are called adjuvants. Purified proteins may be poorly immunogenic and carbohydrates, 
nucleic acids and other types of molecule usually require modification to induce an 
immune response. These issues are important for development and use of vaccines 
(Section 4.11). 
WHAT DO THE INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNE 
RESPONSES RECOGNISE? 
Targets of the innate immune response 
Groups of organisms often have distinctive molecular patterns that are targets of the innate 
immune response. Table 1.8.2 summarises the most important of these targets and 
corresponding organisms, the pattern recognition receptor or molecule and their cellular 
location. PRMs are utilised by the innate immune response, to facilitate removal of 
pathogens.

Thymus-dependent (TD) antigens (most proteins) require T cell help to induce antibody 
production. Thymus-independent (TI) antigens induce antibody production without T cell 
help; some bacterial polysaccharides, polymeric proteins and lipopolysaccharides can 
directly stimulate specific B cells. B cell responses to TI antigens are particularly important 
in organisms whose surface antigens elicit weak peptide-specific T cell responses. In 
children adequate responses to TI-antigens can take 4-6 years to develop (Table 1.8.3). 
There are two types of Tl-antigens that activate B cells by different mechanisms: 
¢ 
 TI-1 antigens possess intrinsic B cell stimulatory activity. At high concentrations 
TI-1 antigens activate the majority of B cells independently of their specific B cell 
receptor, acting as mitogens. At low concentrations, only B cells specific for the 
TI-1 antigen are activated. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are TI-1 antigens. 
¢ 
 TI-2 antigens are linear molecules with highly repetitive structures, for example, bac- 
terial capsular polysaccharides. TI-2 antigens activate mature B cells by extensive 
cross-linking of their specific B cell receptors. The capsular polysaccharide of 
Haemophilus influenzae type B is a TI-2 antigen.

Vaccination and Passive Immunisation

Human Leucocyte 
Antigen (HLA) Molecules 
HLA 
38 
HLA molecules are the human MHC molecules. HLA molecules play a pivotal role in the 
normal immune response, and inability to express these molecules causes a lethal immuno- 
deficiency. An individual’s HLA type determines in part their ability to respond to infection 
and predisposition to autoimmune disease. Matching donor and recipient HLA types as 
closely as possible improves outcome in most types of transplantation. 
MOLECULES — STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION 
HLA molecules are divided into two main classes, HLA Class I (including HLA-A, B and C) and 
HLA Class II molecules (including HLA-DR, DP and DQ). HLA Class I molecules have one 
variable a chain, and are stabilised by By-microglobulin. HLA Class II molecules are hetero- 
dimers, comprising 2 variable chains (a and B chains). Both Class I and Class II molecules have 
a peptide-binding groove (Figure 1.9.1). The physiological function of both classes of HLA 
molecules is to present short pathogen-derived peptides to T cells. This is the key interaction 
in initiating an antigen specific, adaptive immune response. 
HLA molecules bind many different peptides stably as an integral part of the HLA mol- 
ecule — HLA is unstable when peptides are not bound. The peptide binding domains of 
HLA Class I, and HLA Class II molecules are polymorphic; that is, particular amino acids 
in the peptide-binding grooves vary from allele to allele. These polymorphic residues make 
contact with the antigen-derived peptide. The peptide amino acids that bind HLA are called 
anchor residues. Peptides range in length from 8 to 10 residues for HLA Class I, to 12-20 
residues for HLA Class II. 
HLA Class I molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells and on platelets and present 
cytoplasmic peptides to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Widespread expression of HLA Class I 
molecules allows all cells to present peptides from intracellular pathogens to cytotoxic T cells 
of the immune system. 
HLA Class II molecules are expressed on a restricted repertoire of immune cells including 
dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages, B cells, activated T cells and thymic epithelial cells. 
HLA Class II molecules present antigen to CD4+ helper T cells to initiate adaptive immune 
responses, a role requiring restricted expression. At sites of inflammation, particularly in the

presence of IFN-y, Class II molecules are induced on cells that do not normally express these 
molecules. 
The genes encoding the HLA molecules are found in a small cluster on Chromosome 6 
(Figure 1.9.2). This region contains in excess of 200 genes including both HLA, non-HLA 
genes involved in the immune response, and many genes with no apparent immunological role. 
HLA MOLECULES — DIVERSITY 
Within the population, there are hundreds of different HLA alleles. Most variability 
between different alleles of a HLA molecule resides around the peptide-binding groove. 
Expression of HLA molecules is polygenic (we each have several HLA genes) and poly- 
morphic (at each HLA gene locus there are many possible alleles). Individuals of differing 
HLA type infected with the same organism will usually present different pathogen-derived 
peptides to initiate an immune response. The outcome of the immune response is often 
equivalent, however, possession of particular HLA types has been associated with disease 
resistance in some situations. For example, expression of HLA-B53 is associated with 
reduced mortality from severe malaria. 
39 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
We inherit one set of HLA genes from each parent, and both maternal and paternal alleles 
are expressed on all cells. Within particular populations gene ‘packages’ known as haplotypes 
are frequently identified. Thus some HLA genes may be found almost exclusively associated 
with typical haplotypes within a particular population. These haplotypes include HLA genes 
and also the intervening genes encoded on chromosome 6, many of which have immunologi- 
cal functions. Haplotype associations of HLA molecules differ in different populations. 
Genetic diversity of HLA molecules helps to ensure that some members of a population 
can mount an immune response to any organism. While some individuals may be unable 
to eliminate a pathogen, diversity makes survival at population levels more likely. At an 
individual level, people who are heterozygous (expressing different maternal and paternal 
HLA alleles) can bind and present a greater repertoire of peptides to their T cells. It 
appears that progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is slower in 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who are heterozygous for HLA 
molecules, suggesting a possible survival advantage attributable to HLA diversity. 
DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS 
Particular HLA types have been associated with both disease susceptibility and resistance. 
Associations are relative rather than absolute, and therefore are rarely useful in establish- 
ing a diagnosis in individual patients. Apparent associations may reflect a true role of the 
HLA molecule or may be due to linkage between the HLA allele and a physically close 
disease related (non-HLA) gene. In the non-immunological sleep disorder narcolepsy, 
an apparent HLA association was explained by linkage disequilibrium between a mutated 
gene encoding a hypocretin receptor and particular HLA alleles. 
Several non-HLA genes are encoded in the HLA region of chromosome 6, many of which 
affect the immune response. For example, the TNF-a gene is encoded in this region, and a 
functional polymorphism in this gene determines whether large or small amounts of TNF-a 
are produced. The high-producing TNF-a genotype is linked to HLA-DR3 and included in 
a haplotype associated with increased risk of autoimmunity. Determining whether an appar- 
ent HLA association is significant is complicated by the common occurrence of haplotypes. 
Demonstrating a true HLA effect usually requires the study of several populations where 
individual HLA molecules are found with different haplotype associations.

Antigen Presentation 
Antigen Presentation 
The protective function of T cells depends on their ability to detect cells that harbour or 
internalise pathogens. T cells do this by responding to pathogen-derived peptides bound to 
MHC molecules on cell surfaces. Antigens may be endogenous (derived from molecules 
inside the cell, including molecules derived from intracellular pathogens) or exogenous 
(occurring outside the cell, but taken up by the processing cell). The generation of peptides 
from antigens is known as antigen processing. Not surprisingly, different mechanisms are 
involved in processing endogenous and exogenous antigens. The display of these peptides 
on the cell surface is known as antigen presentation. 
ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS 
Pathogens and other exogenous antigens are internalised into the vesicular compartments of 
antigen presenting cells (APCs), by phagocytosis, endocytosis or macropinocytosis. APCs 
include professional APCs such as dendritic cells that specialise in stimulating a T cell 
response; non-professional APCs such as macrophages that can present antigen but have 
other primary functions and B cells that internalise antigen by receptor-mediated endocytosis 
of cognate antigen bound to their surface immunoglobulin (slg). 
MHC CLASS | AND CLASS I] MOLECULES DELIVER 
PEPTIDES TO THE CELL SURFACE FROM DIFFERENT 
CELLULAR COMPARTMENTS WHERE THEY ARE 
RECOGNISED BY TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF T CELL 
MHC Class I molecules deliver peptides produced in the cytosol to the cell surface where 
they are recognised by CD8 cytotoxic T cells (TCs). In this way cytotoxic T cells kill cells 
infected with viruses or bacteria residing in the cytosol. 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
MHC Class II molecules deliver peptides from the vesicular system to the cell surface 
where they are recognised by CD4 helper T cells. In this way, helper T cells detect pathogens 
and their products taken up from the extracellular environment into the vesicular 
compartment of cells and activate other cells to eliminate the pathogen. 
ENDOGENOUS ANTIGEN PATHWAY — MHC CLASS | 
Generally pathogen-derived peptides that bind MHC Class I molecules are derived from 
viruses that have infected host cells. Viruses take over the cell’s biosynthetic mechanisms to 
make their own proteins, which are degraded and synthesised as part of normal cell protein 
turnover. 
¢ 
Cytosolic protein degradation takes place in a multicatalytic protease complex called 
the proteosome (Figure 1.10.1). 
¢ 
Degraded proteins are transported from the cytosol of a cell into the lumen of the 
endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) via membrane 
transporter 
proteins 
(transporters 
associated with antigen processing or TAP-1 and TAP-2). 
¢ 
In this compartment peptides bind to MHC Class I molecules. Peptide binding is 
an essential step in the assembly of MHC Class I molecules and this process involves 
a number of accessory proteins with chaperone-like functions. 
Peptide: MHC Class I complex is then transported to the cell surface where it can be 
recognised by cytotoxic T cells. 
Some viruses have evolved ways to evade recognition by down-regulating the appearance of 
peptide:MHC complexes on the cell surface.

are

(Figure

to cytosolic 
proteosomes. 
* 
Protein degradation takes place in these vesicles which contain proteases. 
¢ 
MHC Class II molecules are prevented from binding peptides in the ER by associating 
with the invariant chain (Ii), which also targets the molecule to endosomes. MHC Class 
II molecules reach the endocytic vesicles of macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells. 
@ 
When these endocytic vesicles 
fuse with peptide containing vesicles, the MHC 
molecules are loaded with peptides and transported to the cell surface where the 
peptide:MHC Class II complex can be recognised by helper T cells. 
Initiation of an immune response requires activation of helper T cells by APCs with pep- 
tide bound to MHC Class II. APCs constantly take up antigen from their environment, and 
thus bacterial and viral antigens reach the endosomal compartment, even though this is not 
their normal site of infection. Additionally several pathogens including mycobacteria and 
Leishmania replicate in cellular vesicles of macrophages.

RECOGNITION MOLECULES OF THE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
The innate immune response recognises microbes by the presence of molecular motifs, 
which are not present in mammalian cells, using pattern recognition molecules (PRMs). 
PRMs are constitutively expressed and allow the innate immune response to be constantly 
effective, as there is no delay required to rearrange microbe specific receptors. Important 
PRMs are outlined below. A summary of molecular targets of PRMs involved in the innate 
immune response was presented in Table 1.8.2. 
Mannose receptor 
The mannose receptor binds mannose in microbes and induces phagocytosis. Peptides from 
the microbe are processed and presented by macrophages, and can activate some T cell 
subtypes. 
Toll receptors 
CD14 
44 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of closely related proteins that recognise several 
microbial motifs including peptidoglycan, teichoic acids (found on gram-positive bacteria), 
LPS (gram-negative bacteria), arabinomannans and glucans. Binding of ligand to TLRs 
induces expression of immunostimulatory molecules and cytokines important in initiation 
of the adaptive immune response. 
CD14, found on macrophages, binds LPS, a unique bacterial surface structure found in cell 
walls of gram-negative bacteria, together with an adaptor protein. When LPS binds CD14, 
macrophages 
are activated 
facilitating destruction of the microbe and secretion of 
cytokines, triggering a wide variety of immune responses. 
HOW DOES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SEE ANTIGEN? 
Scavenger receptors 
These receptors are expressed by macrophages and recognise carbohydrates or lipids in 
bacterial and yeast cell walls. 
RECOGNITION MOLECULES OF THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
In the adaptive immune response, lymphocytes have unique recognition structures that 
allow them to see antigen. 
* 
Bcell receptor (BCR) 
* 
T cell receptor (TCR). 
The BCR is surface bound immunoglobulin, and binds conformational epitopes. TCR 
binds linear epitopes, presented in grooves in MHC molecules. BCR, TCR and MHC 
proteins are all members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. 
B cell receptor complex and B cell co-receptors 
The BCR complex comprises BCR surface immunoglobulin (slg) associated with two 
signaling molecules Iga and IgB (Figure 1.11.1). Iga and Ig are also required for assem- 
bly and expression of slg. When antigen cross-links slg, Iga and IgB transduce activation 
signals into the B cell. Ligation of B cell co-receptors can enhance or inhibit signaling via 
the Ig—-Iga/Ig8 complex. Optimal activation requires additional signals from helper T cells. 
Activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells and secrete antibody. 
Antibody-antigen interactions 
The antigen-binding site of immunoglobulin molecules is composed of variable regions of 
both heavy and light chains. Antigen specificity of the immunoglobulin is determined by 
variation in the amino acid sequences of variable regions. Three segments are particularly 
variable — hypervariable (HV) regions 1-3. Hypervariable segments form surfaces comple- 
mentary to the antigen: complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) 1-3. Variation in the 
amino acid sequences of CDRs creates different surface shapes. Antibodies bind epitopes 
with complementary shapes which fit tightly (Figure 1.11.1). 
T cell receptor (TCR), the TCR complex and co-receptors 
Most T cells have antigen receptors composed of a and B chains, each with variable and 
constant regions (V and C regions). A subpopulation of T cells, the function of which is 
poorly understood, express TCRs consisting of yy and 6 chains. The TCR complex consists 
of the TCR associated with CD3 a signaling complex. CD4 or CD8 (co-receptors) play an 
important role in stabilising the interaction of TCR with MHC-peptide complex. 
TCRs interact directly with both the antigenic peptide and some polymorphic regions 
of the MHC molecule presenting the peptide. CD4 or CD8 help to stabilise the TCR- 
peptide-MHC interaction which is of very low avidity. CD4 and CD8 distinguish two 
different functional sets of T cell. CD4 is expressed on helper T cells and binds a non- 
polymorphic region of MHC Class II molecules. This effectively restricts helper T cells to 
recognise peptides appropriately presented on MHC Class II molecules. In contrast, CD8 
is expressed on cytotoxic T cells allowing recognition of peptides presented on MHC Class I 
molecules which is widely expressed.

cells. Antigens including those derived from pathogens internalised by endocytosis from 
extracellular fluid, associate with MHC Class II molecules, found on specialised APCs.

HOW DOES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SEE ANTIGEN? 
Superantigen 
Classical antigens generate peptides that bind the peptide-binding groove of MHC Class II. 
In contrast superantigens bind directly to MHC without processing. Superantigens bind to 
relatively non-polymorphic portions of MHC Class II and the Vf region of the TCR 
(Figure 1.11.2b). Each superantigen can bind a few families of VB gene segments, and 
therefore superantigens can stimulate 2-20% of all T cells. This type of response causes a 
massive production of CD4 T cell cytokines resulting in systemic toxicity and suppression 
of adaptive immunity. 
Clinically important superantigens include Staphylococcal enterotoxins that cause food 
poisoning, and the toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST).

Lymphocyte Maturation 
Lymphocytes must recognise a huge diversity of antigens and must develop the functional 
capacity to play many roles in generating, enhancing and regulating specific immune 
responses. Each lymphocyte expresses a single specificity of antigen receptor. B and T cell 
maturation pathways share many common features but anatomical sites of maturation, and 
some molecular events in antigen receptor generation are distinct to each population. NK 
cells are another population of lymphocytes, which do not interact with antigens in a 
specific manner, and do not express rearranged antigen specific receptors. 
The functions of lymphocytes are: 
Antibody production (specifically B cells) 
Cell-mediated inflammation (T cells) 
Regulation of other immune cell functions (T cell) 
Cytotoxicity (T cell and NK cells).

My LYMPHOCYTE POPULATIONS 
B lymphocytes 
B cells recognise antigens. through surface immunoglobulin (slg). Terminally differentiated 
B cells, called plasma cells, produce and secrete antibodies, the specificity of which is 
identical to the slg expressed by their B cell precursors. Following maturation in the bone 
marrow, most B cells that survive the selection process circulate through secondary 
lymphoid tissues. These are conventional or B-2 B cells. 
B-1 B cells are a smaller subset of B cells, which produce a limited repertoire of low 
affinity and polyspecific antibodies reactive with common bacterial antigens. B-1 B cells 
may represent a primitive population whose function is intermediate between innate and 
specific immune responses. 
T lymphocytes 
T lymphocytes express T cell receptors (TCRs) and CD3. Most T lymphocytes express 
a TCR comprising a and 8 chains (a8 T cells) and also either CD4 or CD8, which direct 
LYMPHOCYTE MATURATION 
the pattern of antigen interaction. Antigens recognised by af T cells are processed peptides, 
presented by host-derived MHC molecules. Factors influencing the pattern of T cell 
response include the pattern of innate immune activation, characteristics of the stimulating 
antigen, and type of antigen presentation. 
aB T cells 
Two broad categories of aB T cells are described as follows: 
* 
Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs or Tcs) - usually express CD8 and recognise endogenous anti- 
gens (viruses, tumours). 
* 
Helper T cells (THs) usually express CD4. They respond to extracellular antigens 
including bacteria that are taken up into vesicles in the cells. Activation of helper 
T cells requires processing and presentation of antigen in association with MHC Class II 
molecules by professional APCs. These cells typically ‘help’ other cells of the immune 
system rather than having a direct effector function. 
Helper T cells are in turn further sub-divided based on patterns of cytokine expression. The 
two extremes are: 
¢ 
THI — produce IFN-y and tumour necrosis factor that enhance macrophage function, 
cellular immunity, production of some antibody types and granulomatous inflammation. 
@ 
 TH2 - enhance IgE-mediated responses through the action of IL-4 and IL-S. 
TH1 and TH2 responses are for the most part mutually exclusive and suppressive of the 
other. Further T cell subpopulations are increasingly recognised, such as regulatory T cells - 
TR — and TH3 that impose control on cell-mediated immune responses through the action 
of cytokines including IL-10 and TGF-B. 
v5 T cells 
v5 T cells express 
a TCR composed of y- and 8-chains and are preferentially expressed in 
skin and at mucosal surfaces. Their antigen interactions are not as specific as those of a8 
T cells. Diverse effector functions mirroring those of aB T cells have been identified. These 
cells may represent a T cell equivalent of B-1 B cells. 
Unconventional T cells 
CD3+ T cells expressing unusual patterns of surface molecules common to conventional T 
cells and NK cells are called NK-T cells. Antigen recognition by NK-T cells extends beyond 
peptide fragments expressed by MHC molecules. The functional significance of this popu- 
lation is not fully understood. 
NK cells 
These can kill certain tumour targets and virus-infected cells. Early production of IL-12 by 
NK cells encountering viruses and intracellular bacteria skews the later specific immune 
responses towards a TH1-type response. 
NK cells express activating receptors and inhibitory receptors, which interact with MHC 
Class I molecules, preventing uncontrolled activation of NK cells. If MHC expression is dis- 
turbed, as occurs in virus-infected or tumour-laden cells, inhibition is lost resulting in NK 
cell cytotoxicity.

BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF MATURE LYMPHOCYTE POPULATIONS 
Haemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells. 
Lymphoid-committed precursor cells mature in 
¢ 
Bone marrow — where they receive signals that promote development into B cells 
or 
¢ 
Thymus - where T cells develop. 
A small proportion of T cells, especially non-conventional ones like yé T cells and NK-T 
cells may mature outside the thymus. 
Lymphocytes mature by a series of sequential differentiation steps defined by patterns of 
molecular expression, especially antigen receptor or antigen receptor-associated molecules. 
The early phases of lymphocyte maturation occur independent of exposure to antigen. 
Once complete antigen receptors are expressed by developing lymphocytes, further survival 
and functional capacity requires interaction with antigen (Figure 1.12.1). 
B lymphocyte maturation 
B cells are generated throughout life in the bone marrow. Development stages are marked 
by the ordered rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes. The key stages and the important 
molecule expression patterns are highlighted. 
¢ 
Pro-B 
cells 
— 
express B cell-specific molecules (CD19, surrogate 
light chain). 
Immunoglobulin genes are in germline configuration. 
* 
 Pre-B cells — express surface IgM heavy chain associated with surrogate light chain — 
pre-B receptor. Immunoglobulin genes 
are rearranged by enzymes encoded by 
Recombinase Activating Genes (RAG), and the IgM expressed originates from 
whichever chromosome successfully rearranged first. RAG gene expression is switched 
off, inhibiting rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes on the other chro- 
mosome 
— allelic exclusion. Subsequent re-expression of RAG allows light chain 
immunoglobulin genes to rearrange. Kappa (k) genes initially rearrange. If unsuccess- 
ful, the \ genes rearrange sequentially until a functional light chain is produced. 
* 
Immature B cells -IgM+ IgD— immunoglobulin receptor expression allows these cells 
interact specifically with antigen. Further survival and differentiation is dependent on 
whether or not selection or activation signals are received through the BCR. This is 
discussed further in Section 1.14. 
T lymphocyte maturation 
50 
T cells develop from thymic lymphoid progenitor cells. NK cells and NK-T cells also arise 
from thymic progenitors, but details of their development are unclear. As with B cells, 
stages of T cell maturation are marked by specific patterns of TCR and other molecule 
expression. The key stages are 
* 
‘Double-negative’ cells — lack CD4 and CD8 expression. Most have not rearranged 
TCR gene segments. CD2 but not CD3 is expressed. 
* 
‘Double positive’ cells — dually express CD4 and CD8. T cells only reach this stage if 
a successful TCR is made.

Selected T cells — at this stage T cells are screened for ability to interact with host MHC — 
peptide complexes expressed on cortical epithelial cells and interdigitating dendritic 
cells. They also lose either CD4 or CD8 and become ‘single positive’ thymocytes. T cells 
must be able to recognise MHC for conventional T cell-mediated antigen recognition. 
Cells that pass this hurdle are positively selected for survival. T cells then undergo 
negative selection, where potentially autoreactive T cells are eliminated, an important 
safeguard against autoimmunity. 
Negative selection in T cells is more rigorous than with B cells. A lack of T cell help will 
hold autoreactive B cells in check. Only about 1% of thymocytes mature and enter the 
peripheral pool. 
Both af- and y8-T cells are derived from the same early thymocyte precursor cell type. 
The type of TCR expressed — either TCRaB or TCRyé — depends on which of the TCR 
chains makes the first successful rearrangement. The same T cell cannot express both types 
of TCR. Successful rearrangement of TCRa disables 6-gene segments, and B and 6 chains 
do not usually align correctly to form a functional TCR. Early in life, more T cells of the 
TCRy8 lineage are produced, but subsequently TCRaB-expressing T cells predominate. 
TCRy65 cells often do not express either CD4 or CD8.

T Cell Receptor and Immune Repertoire 
Immunoglobulin Structure 
Antibodies, also called immunoglobulins (Ig), are glycoproteins, produced by plasma cells, 
that bind antigens with a relatively high specificity and affinity. 
ANTIBODY STRUCTURE 
Antibody molecules are comprised of two identical light chains and two identical heavy 
chains. Light chains may be kappa (xk) or lambda (A) in type, but this does not affect 
antibody function. 
The antibody isotype or class is determined by the heavy chain (p, y, a, € or 5) giving rise 
to immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), 
immunoglobulin E (igE) and immunoglobulin D (IgD), respectively. In addition to differences 
in the basic antibody unit, antibody isotypes differ in the number of units in a typical molecule — 
IgM is usually pentameric, IgA dimeric and both IgG and IgE monomeric (Figure 1.13.1). The 
five isotypes differ greatly in functional activity. IgG is subdivided into the subclasses IgG1, 
IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 and IgA into IgA1 and IgA2 subclasses. Antibody subclasses differ in 
heavy chain amino acid sequences conferring functional differences (Section 1.15). 
Variable and constant regions of heavy and light chains 
Heavy and light chains have a variable region (composed of variable domains), and a 
constant region (composed of constant domains). Variable regions of heavy and light chains 
generate two identical antigen-binding sites, conferring specificity on the antibody. The 
heavy-chain constant region determines the antibody isotype and functional properties. 
Functionally distinct fragments of the antibody molecule — Fc and Fab 
Proteolytic cleavage by the enzyme papain cleaves immunoglobulin into two Fab fragments 
and one intact Fe fragment. The Fab fragment binds antigen and the Fe fragment contains 
constant domains.

ALLOTYPES 
Non-functional polymorphisms occur in genes encoding heavy chain constant regions 
giving rise to allotypes. Allotypes are differences between individuals’ antibody molecules, 
comparable to different blood groups. There is no functional difference between antibodies 
of different allotypes. 
“ 
IDIOTYPES 
Idiotypes are unique antigenic determinants found in antigen-binding sites of antibodies. They 
result from different amino acid sequences in antigen-binding sites that determine the anti- 
body specificity. Idiotypes are unique to antibodies produced by the same clone of B cells. 
GENERATION OF DIVERSITY 
The antibody response to an antigen is diverse, generating many different B cell clones each 
with its own unique specificity. An individual's collection of antibody specificities is called 
54 
IMMUNOGLOBULIN STRUCTURE 
the antibody repertoire. Antibody diversity is generated during B cell development by 
random combination of gene segments from heavy-chain and light-chain gene groups 
(Figure 1.13.2). 
There are three gene clusters encoding immunoglobulins: 
¢ 
«-chain clusters are found on chromosome 2 
¢ 
-chain genes are found on chromosome 22 
¢ 
Heavy-chain gene clusters are found on chromosome 14. 
Variable and constant regions of immunoglobulin molecules are encoded by V gene 
segments and C gene segments, respectively. 
Somatic recombination generates variable regions 
The variable region of heavy and light chains is generated from separate V region gene 
segments by a process of DNA rearrangement known as somatic recombination. The 
heavy-chain V region gene segments include Variable (Vj), Diversity (Dy) and Joining (Jy), 
while the light chain contains variable (V,) and joining segments (J;). 
V region recombination 
involves the ‘VDJ recombinase’ enzyme complex, which 
includes generic DNA cleavage and repair enzymes and lymphocyte-specific components. 
RAG-1 and RAG-2 are lymphocyte-specific enzymes, essential for VDJ recombination. 
VDJ recombination results in removal of intervening gene segments, permanently changing 
the genomic DNA in the B cell. The assembled variable regions of both heavy and light 
chains join to their respective constant regions after transcription, by RNA splicing. Heavy- 
chain C region genes have several gene segments, each encoding the constant region for a 
different antibody class (Cu, Cy, Ca, Cd, Ce). x chains have one C gene segment for its 
constant region, while \ chains have four C gene segments. Heavy chain genes undergo 
rearrangement before light chain genes. 
Regulation of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement ensures that each B cell only 
expresses one rearranged heavy chain and one rearranged light chain. Therefore each B cell 
expresses millions of identical surface antibodies. 
ANTIBODY DIVERSITY IS GENERATED BY FOUR PROCESSES, 
WHICH TOGETHER CREATE A VAST REPERTOIRE OF ANTIBODY 
SPECIFICITIES FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF GENES 
i 
There are several different gene segments making up the variable regions of both heavy 
and light chains (Table 1.13.1). Different combinations of variable region gene seg- 
ments recombining randomly generate considerable diversity in the antigen-binding 
site. This is known as combinatorial diversity. 
Pairing of different heavy and light chains increases diversity. 
During recombination, imprecise joining of gene segments results in insertion of addi- 
tional nucleotides — known as junctional diversity. 
4 
Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations into variable regions of rearranged 
heavy and light chain genes. This allows the antibody specificity to be changed after 
recombination occurs. Mutant antibody molecules may bind antigen better or less 
well than the original antibody. B cells expressing higher affinity antibody are selected 
and mature into antibody-secreting cells. Somatic hypermutation and selection of high 
affinity antibody gives rise to the physiological phenomenon of affinity maturation, 
whereby the affinity of antibodies produced improves 
as an immune response 
develops.

Signalling 
Rearrangement of gene segments occurs in developing B cells in bone marrow. Somatic 
hypermutation occurs in B cells in secondary lymphoid organs after functional antibody has 
been expressed. 
THE B CELL RECEPTOR COMPLEX 
Immunoglobulin was first discovered in plasma. However, before antibody can be secreted, 
immunoglobulin must function as the cell-surface antigen receptor, that is, the B cell receptor 
(BCR). Antigen binding to BCR activates B cells, leading to clonal expansion and differen- 
tiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. B cells initially express transmembrane IgM 
and when activated differentiate into plasma cells. B cell activation usually requires 
specialised interactions with helper T cells that provide additional signals. 
The BCR complex includes the antigen receptor, surface immunoglobulin, associated with 
two other polypeptides, Iga and Ig8. When slg is crosslinked, these proteins transmit signals 
leading to B cell proliferation and differentiation. They are also required for the expression 
and assembly of immunoglobulin (Figure 1.13.3). B cell co-receptors (CD21, CD19 and 
CD81) play an important role in enhancing or inhibiting B cell activation. Activation of 
B cells and subsequent signalling events are described in more detail in Section 1.14.

B CELL SELECTION 
58 
B cells can interact with antigen once surface immunoglobulin is expressed. The type of 
responses initiated are influenced by 
¢ 
Bcell maturation stage 
¢ 
Signal intensity through the antigen receptor. 
The signal intensity also influences whether B cells become re-circulating follicular cells, 
marginal zone cells or B-1 B cells. 
IgM+, IgD— immature B cells are 
exquisitely sensitive 
to antigen exposure 
(Figure 1.14.1). Antigen exposure can result in 
¢ 
Clonal deletion — large concentrations of cross-linking antigen promotes cell death. 
¢ 
Clonal anergy — cells remain viable but non-functioning following exposure to soluble 
antigen. 
* 
Receptor editing — 
the immunoglobulin receptor 
alters. Continued RAG gene 
expression allows further immunoglobulin gene rearrangement. Following receptor 
editing, B cells which react with self antigen undergo clonal deletion, while those that 
do not react with self antigen persist. After the IgM+ IgD— stage, RAG expression is 
switched off and gene rearrangement ceases. 
These responses reduce the chances of producing auto-reactive B cells. However, these 
processes are leaky and self-reactive B cells are usually present in the peripheral lymphocyte 
pool. Other mechanisms are required to keep these auto-reactive B cells in check (Section 1.21). 
B cells surviving these hurdles are called naive (or ‘virgin’) newly produced B cells. IgM and 
IgD are co-expressed on their cell membranes. 
B cells are produced so rapidly that the peripheral pool of mature B cells could be fully 
reconstituted with newly produced B cells every 4-5 days. Only a small minority (<10%) 
of newly produced B cells survive beyond a few days. Small numbers of newly produced B 
cells are recruited to the peripheral pool to replace dying mature B cells. Some cells interact

B CELL ACTIVATION 
* 
Kinases (Fyn, Blk and Lyn) — enzymes that promote phosphorylation at target sites — 
associate with the immunoglobulin receptor and generate activation signals. 
The signal generated on binding antigen (the primary signal) is usually not adequate to 
activate B cells to proliferate and differentiate. 
The second signal 
T cell help for B cell responses 
Secondary signals usually delivered by antigen-specific T cells are typically required for 
B cell activation. Responses to most protein antigens are T dependent (TD). T cell depend- 
ence prevents self-reacting B cells from becoming functional. T cell influences on B cell 
immune responses include: 
¢ 
Promotion of high affinity antibody production 
¢ 
Induction of immunoglobulin isotype switching 
* 
Enhancement of long-term memory responses. 
Prior to antigen exposure, only about 1 in 100,000 lymphocytes are specific for a single 
conventional TD antigen. Secondary lymphoid organs concentrate rare antigen-specific 
B and T cells, increasing the chance of encounter. Inter-digitating dendritic cells ‘trap’ 
antigen-specific T cells re-circulating through the secondary lymphoid tissues and prime 
them for further antigen encounter. Meanwhile, antigen-specific B cells, on receiving the 
first antigen-specific signal move 
to the T cell zones under the control of several 
chemokines. 
Antigen binding to the BCR mediates uptake of bound antigen into the B cell, processing 
into 
peptides 
and 
packaging 
with 
antigen-presenting MHC 
Class 
II molecules 
(Figure 1.14.2b). B cells express MHC Class II from the early stages of maturation. 
Presentation of peptide with MHC Class II on the B cell surface brings antigen-specific 
T cells into close proximity with B cells responding to components of the same antigen. 
This is called linked recognition. 
T cells provide ‘help’ to B cells through 
¢ 
Cognate interaction — primed antigen-specific T cells help B cells to proliferate, and 
differentiate. The T cell interacting with B cell is specific for the same antigen. 
Interaction of CD40 expressed by B cells, with CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on 
antigen-specific activated T cells, drives B cell proliferation, antibody class switching 
and generation of memory responses. Deficiency of CD40L causes immunodeficiency — 
hyper IgM syndrome — characterised by failure of immunoglobulin class switching. 
Other B cell/T 
cell interactions are important in generating TD B cell responses, including 
B7/CD28. 
¢ 
Non-cognate — reactions are not antigen-specific. Once activated through cognate 
interactions, B cells can respond to cytokines secreted by activated T cells. T cell 
cytokines affect B cell proliferation (IL-4), immunoglobulin class switching (IL-4, 
transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B) and IFN-y), and differentiation into plasma 
cells (IL-6). 
B cell proliferation hugely increases the frequency of antigen-specific cells over a few days. 
B cells do not proliferate indefinitely but rather differentiate, in a manner determined by the 
type of antigen, the type of T cell cognate interactions and the cytokine environment. 
61 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
Activated B cells can differentiate into the following: 
¢ 
 Short-lived plasma cells — produce IgM predominantly. 
¢ 
Follicular B cells — relocate from the T zone of secondary lymphoid tissues into the 
follicles where they establish a germinal centre reaction. Somatic hypermutation occurs 
in rapidly dividing germinal centre B cells (centroblasts). 
Variable 
regions of 
immunoglobulin genes are altered. Some B cells improve the affinity with which they 
bind antigen. This is a short-lived event in the immune response and cells that have 
undergone somatic hypermutation (centrocytes) subsequently require signals from 
antigen and T cells to survive. Only B cells that receive both these signals — that is, 
responsive to native antigen and not self-reactive — survive. 
Some surviving centrocytes differentiate to become: 
* 
Long-lived plasma cells — relocate to bone marrow and the lamina propria of the gut, or 
* 
Memory B cells — colonise the marginal zones of secondary lymphoid tissues, responding 
with faster and bigger responses on second and subsequent exposures to antigen. 
T INDEPENDENT B CELL ACTIVATION 
The polysaccharide capsules of many pyogenic bacteria have distinct repeating structures. 
Antigen receptor binding of highly repetitive epitopes induces extensive cross-linking of 
the BCR complex and the B cell may be activated without additional signals. Activated 
complement and macrophage factors can also promote B cell activation. Antigens associated 
with lipopolysaccharide (e.g. gram-negative bacteria) are potent activators of complement 
and macrophages. If these factors can provide an adequate second signal to B cells during 
antigen-specific activation the requirement for T cells in B cell activation may be bypassed. 
Both LPS- and polysaccharide-based antigens are classed as T independent (TI) because T cells 
are not essential for B cells to make antibody responses. 
TI-type responses are either 
¢ 
TI-1- responses generated by LPS and similar antigens 
or 
¢ 
TI-2 — responses generated by polysaccharide antigens. Marginal zone B cells may 
preferentially respond to TI-2 antigens. 
Different mechanisms allow both types of antigen to be TI. Although not essential, T cells 
can regulate B cell responses induced by TI antigens.

Immunoglobulin Function 
Antibody binding to pathogen is not sufficient to kill the organism. The Fe portion of 
immunoglobulin (Ig) can recruit complement or phagocytes to kill the organism. In this 
way antibodies harness innate effector mechanisms to kill microbes. Antibody protects by

NEUTRALISING TOXINS 
Toxins bind to receptors on cells, altering cell function. If antibody prevents interaction of 
toxin with receptor, 
cell function remains unaffected and the toxin is neutralised. 
Neutralisation is dependent on the antigen-binding domain only, and is not affected by the 
Fc portion of Ig (Figure 1.15.1). 
_ NEUTRALISING ORGANISMS 
To establish infection organisms must adhere to epithelial surfaces using a limited number 
of adhesion molecules. Antibodies that bind to key portions of these adhesion molecules 
prevent organisms binding to mucosae and subsequent infection. Neutralisation of organ- 
isms is only affected by the antigen-binding domain, and not by the Fe portion. However, 
the antibody isotype determines the ability of antibody to cross mucosal surfaces. 
COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION 
IgG and IgM activate complement via the classical pathway. This generates anaphylatoxins 
(C3a and CSa) that activate mast cells and attract neutrophils to the site of infection.

Deposition of C3 on the organism results in assembly of the membrane attack complex 
(MAC). In susceptible organisms, insertion of MAC causes leakage of cellular contents 
and lysis. Bacterial capsules may inhibit MAC assembly, conferring resistance to complement- 
mediated lysis. Complement activation requires the Fe portion of Ig, and the effectiveness 
of antibodies at activating complement varies with the isotype. 
OPSONISATION 
Opsonisation is the process whereby microbes and other cells are flagged for phagocytosis. 
Phagocytes (neutrophils and macrophages) ingest some organisms in the absence of anti- 
body, however, this is relatively inefficient. Antibody-coated organisms are usually phago- 
cytosed. The antibody acts as a bridge between the organism and Fe receptor on the 
phagocyte. Binding of Ig to the Fe receptor stimulates phagocytosis and the respiratory 
burst. Fe receptor activation renders the phagocyte competent to kill most pathogens. 
Opsonisation requires the Fe portion of the antibody molecule. 
Complement (particularly C3b) deposition acts synergistically with antibody to greatly 
improve opsonisation. C3 fragments bind complement receptors on phagocytes, stimulating 
particle uptake and activation 
of neutrophils and macrophages. 
Co-stimulation 
of 
neutrophils through Fe and C3 receptors results in greatly enhanced activation. 
ANTIBODY AFFINITY 
64 
Antibody affinity is the binding strength of an antibody-binding site to an antigen. High 
affinity results in tight binding and less chance of antibody dissociating from antigen. 
Different antibody molecules produced in response to the same antigen vary in their tight- 
ness of binding. Antibodies produced by a memory response have higher affinity than in a 
primary response. 
IMMUNOGLOBULIN FUNCTION 
ANTIBODY AVIDITY 
An antibody’s 
avidity 
is determined 
by the combined 
binding strength of all 
antigen-binding sites. More binding sites result in increased total binding strength or 
avidity of antibody binding to antigen. 
IMMUNOGLOBULIN ISOTYPE AND FUNCTION 
IgG 
IgA 
Antibody isotypes have functionally distinct properties, determined by the immunoglobu- 
lin constant regions. The constant region recruits cells and molecules to help destroy 
pathogens. Additionally, each antibody class has different biological activities, capable of 
dealing with different microbes at different sites (Table 1.15.1). 
IgG is the most abundant antibody and is found in extracellular fluid. IgG crosses the pla- 
centa providing passive immunity that persists for 3-6 months after birth. IgG1, IgG2, 
IgG3 and IgG4 have slightly different sequences in their heavy chains and corresponding 
differences in their functions. 
IgA is the main immunoglobulin in secretions (colostrum, saliva etc.) where it exists as a 
dimer. IgA is secreted locally by plasma cells in the mammary and salivary glands, and 
along the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. IgA is transported through

the epithelial cells into the lumen. Secretory IgA contains a secretory component (SC) and a 
J-chain (joining chain) required for transepithelial transport and stability of the IgA mole- 
cule. IgA is the major component of the adaptive immune response at mucosal surfaces. 
IgM is the first antibody produced by B cells. It is expressed on B cells as the B cell antigen 
receptor. Pentameric secreted IgM is also found in blood. IgM antibodies usually have low 
affinity antigen-binding sites, however, since IgM has 10 antigen binding sites per molecule, 
the overall binding avidity is high. This pentameric structure makes it very effective for acti- 
vating the complement system. 
IgD is present in low quantities in the circulation. The principal known function is as an 
antigen receptor on B cells. B cells can express both IgM and IgD, which have the same 
antigen specificity. 
IgE is present in the serum in nanogram quantities. IgE plays an important role in 
protection from infection by parasites and in immediate hypersensitivity responses.

Innate Immune Responses II - The Complement System 
T Cell Receptor and Immune 
Repertoire 
Cellular immunity is mediated through two subpopulations of T cells, helper T cells (THs) 
and cytotoxic T cells (Tcs), distinguished by the cell markers CD4 and CD8, respectively. 
Helper T cells provide help for B cells, macrophages and other T cells, both by cell-to-cell 
contact, and by cytokine production. Cytotoxic T cells eliminate virus-infected cells and 
tumour cells, and may also reject transplants. 
7 CELL RECEPTOR 
Antigen is recognised by the T cell receptor (TCR). Most T cells express 
a TCR formed from 
a- and B-chains. Both chains have variable and constant regions like the immunoglobulin 
molecule, and assembly of a- and B-chains combines their variable regions to form the antigen- 
binding site. A small population of peripheral T cells expresses 
a TCR that consists of -y- and 
8-chains. In epithelial tissues most T cells express the y5-TCR, however, y5-T cells comprise only 
1-5% of T cells in peripheral lymphoid tissue. The function of y8-T cells is poorly understood. 
TCR complex 
The TCR cannot transmit signals to activate the T cell itself. The TCR-complex is composed 
of the TCR and a complex of proteins called CD3 that transduces signals into the T cell 
when its TCR binds to peptide: MHC. The CD3 complex of proteins is composed of a group 
of four separate polypeptides (vy, 6, €, &). y, 6 and ¢ each have signalling motifs in their cyto- 
plasmic domains (Figure 1.16.1a). CD3 proteins are required for TCR surface expression 
and deficiency in the y or e chains results in reduced numbers of TCRs. The TCR binds 
processed peptide, presented in the groove of an MHC molecule (Figure 1.16.1b). 
Co-receptor molecules CD4 and CD8 
Two other cell surface molecules play an important role in T cell activation. The CD4 
molecule expressed on helper T cells, binds the non-polymorphic region of MHC Class II

thereby restricting these T cells to recognising peptides presented on MHC II molecules, 
which are normally only expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs). The CD8 molecule 
on cytotoxic T cells binds the non-polymorphic region of MHC Class I thereby restricting 
these T cells to recognising peptides presented on MHC I molecules, which are expressed 
on all nucleated cells (Figure 1.16.2). The presence of CD4 or CD8 results in a marked 
increase in the sensitivity of a T cell to antigen presented by MHC molecules. 
GENERATION OF DIVERSITY — IMMUNE REPERTOIRE 
68 
The diversity of the cellular immune system results from generation of many different TCRs 
each with its own unique specificity. The complete collection of T cell specificities or T cell 
repertoire is generated during T cell development in the thymus, when a T cell randomly selects 
from its 8 and a chain (or 8 and y chain) gene groups. The diversity of the TCR is achieved by 
recombination of several gene segments in a similar way to that of immunoglobulin.

There are four gene groups or clusters that encode TCR chains: 
* 
8 and y chain clusters are found on chromosome 7 
* 
«and 6 chain genes are found on chromosome 14. 
8 and a chains (or 6 and y chains) each consist of variable and constant domains. Variable 
and constant regions of TCRs are encoded by V gene segments and C gene segments, 
respectively. 
Somatic recombination generates variable regions 
During T cell development, the variable region of 8 or a chains (or 8 and y chains) is 
generated by rearrangement of separate V gene segments (Table 1.16.1) by a process known 
as somatic recombination. Multiple different V region gene segments are present in each gene 
cluster. Assembled variable regions (V regions) of the 8 or a chains are joined to the 
constant region (C region gene segments) after transcription, by RNA splicing. 
The expression of a V-C gene product excludes further rearrangement events (allelic 
exclusion). The T cell becomes committed to the expression of a single V-C a chain, and a 
single V-C 8 chain. The @ and £ chain pair and both variable regions contribute to the 
antigen-binding site. The organisation of gene segments encoding TCR a and B chains is 
similar to that of the immunoglobulin gene segments. This process is summarised in 
Figure 1.16.3. 
The process of gene rearrangement is similar for B cells and T cells and utilises the same 
enzymes. Defects in genes that control V(D)J recombination affect T cells and B cells 
equally. The structural diversity of TCRs is mainly attributable to combinatorial and

genes. The generation of diversity at the antigen binding sites involves broadly similar 
mechanisms of introducing diversity. Table 1.16.2 summarises similarities and differences 
between the BCR and the TCR.

Helper T Cell Activation 
Mature, but antigen-naive T cells recirculate between blood and lymphoid tissue until they 
encounter their specific antigen. On encountering their cognate peptide: MHC complex on 
the surface of an activated professional antigen presenting cell (APC) in lymphoid tissues, 
naive T cells become activated, proliferate and differentiate. T cells are subdivided into 
cytotoxic T cells (Tcs) which are usually CD8+ and helper T cells (THs) which are usually 
CD4+. Helper T cells are further divided based on their profile of cytokine production. 
Initial encounter with antigen initiates a primary immune response. Once activated, primed 
or memory T cells respond quickly and effectively to subsequent antigen exposure. 
_ ACTIVATION OF NAIVE T CELLS REQUIRES TWO SIGNALS 
72 
Signal 1 
Engagement of T cell receptor 
Signal 2 Engagement of co-stimulatory molecules 
Naive T cells recognise peptide: MHC complex on the surface of APCs, however, ligation 
of TCR and CD4 or CD8 is insufficient to activate naive T cells. A second co-stimulatory 
signal is required. Dendritic cells are professional APCs that express MHC and co- 
stimulatory molecules required to activate naive T cells. Non-professional APCs (B cells 
and macrophages) are capable of activating T cells previously primed by dendritic cells, 
including memory T cells. The interaction between peptide: MHC and TCR confers antigen 
specificity on the immune response. However, this interaction is of low avidity, and 
must be stabilised by pairs of adhesion molecules (such as LFA-1 and ICAM-1) and 
co-stimulatory molecules (Figure 1.17.1). 
In lymphoid tissues, T cells bind transiently to APCs, sampling large numbers of 
peptide: MHC complexes. If the naive T cell does not encounter specific antigen it dissociates 
from the APC and continues to recirculate. On recognising its peptide: MHC, signalling 
through the TCR increases the binding affinity of adhesion molecules, stabilising the 
antigen-specific T cell/APC interaction. In the presence of additional co-stimulation, the 
T cell is activated, proliferates and differentiates, producing armed effector T cells. 
HELPER T CELL ACTIVATION 
Co-stimulatory molecules 
Activation of naive T cells requires a co-stimulatory signal, usually delivered by the same 
APC that delivered the antigen-specific signal. Co-stimulatory molecules are upregulated on 
activated dendritic cells following ingestion of antigen and migration to lymphoid organs. 
APCs engage in a co-stimulatory dialogue with T cells involving several different pairs of 
molecules. This is initiated through binding of B7 molecules on activated APCs to CD28 
on T cells. CD40 ligand expressed on the activated T cell binds CD40 on APCs providing 
further potent co-stimulation. 
Antigen binding by TCR in the absence of co-stimulation induces anergy (T cell remains 
viable, but refractory to activation by antigen), or programmed cell death (apoptosis). As 
co-stimulatory molecules are not widely expressed, this helps to maintain self-tolerance in 
peripheral tissues. 
 T CELL ACTIVATION AND INTRACELLULAR 
- SIGNALLING PATHWAYS 
Activation of T cells by antigen together with co-stimulation 
results in sequential 
activation of enzymes and subsequent signalling cascades. These activation signals finally 
initiate transcription of genes and production of proteins that direct T cell proliferation and 
development of effector functions, including genes encoding IL-2 and the a-chain of the 
IL-2 receptor (Figure 1.17.2). When IL-2 binds the IL-2 receptor T cells proliferate, 
and then differentiate 
into armed effector T cells. Availability of potent immuno- 
suppressives that inhibit IL-2 production has greatly enhanced the success of clinical 
transplantation.

PROLIFERATING T CELLS DIFFERENTIATE INTO ARMED EFFECTOR. 
- CELLS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE CO-STIMULATION TO ACT 
Once activated T cells differentiate into armed effector cells synthesising molecules required 
for specialised functions. CD8+ T cells become fully functional cytotoxic T cells (TCs) 
while CD4+ cells become fully effective helper T cells (THs). Once differentiated, encounter 
with specific antigen results in immune attack without the need for further co-stimulation. 
Clearly cytotoxic T cells must be able to kill any virus-infected cell regardless of expression 
of co-stimulation molecules. CD4 T cells must be able to activate B cells and macrophages 
that have taken up antigen. 
Interactions between effector T cells and target 
cells are 
initiated by transient 
interactions through adhesion molecules (LFA-1 and CD2). If TCR binds antigen the 
binding affinity increases, allowing enough time for effector T cells to release effector 
molecules locally on the target cell. Soluble cytokines and membrane-associated molecules 
act in combination to mediate T cell effector functions. 
ACTIVATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF NAIVE CD4 T CELLS 
INTO TH1 OR TH2 CELLS DETERMINES THE CHARACTERISTICS 
OF THE SUBSEQUENT ADAPTIVE RESPONSE 
Once activated, naive CD4 T cells differentiate into helper T cells, which can be further 
differentiated based on the profile of cytokine production. Helper T cell cytokine production 
HELPER T CELL ACTIVATION 
orchestrates the subsequent immune response. The functional fate of the helper CD4 T cell 
is decided during clonal expansion, however, the factors determining the type of helper 
T cell produced are unclear. Initial work classifying helper T cells, performed using cloned 
murine T cell lines demonstrated a clear division into two subtypes, TH1 or TH2 cells, with 
distinct cytokine production profiles. Human studies suggest that TH1 and TH2 cells are 
extreme ends of a spectrum, with many T cells having intermediate cytokine profiles, 
however, the paradigm remains useful. TH1 cells are essential for cell mediated immunity 
and also support production of some opsonising antibody isotypes. TH2 cells are essential 
for production of IgE and also support production of other antibody isotypes. TH1 cells 
suppress the development of TH2 cells and vice versa. T cell help is provided by

Both TH1 and TH2 cells produce IL-3 and GM-CSF which stimulate production of

cell mediated immunity. 
ACTIVATION OF MACROPHAGES BY ARMED CD4 Tu1 CELLS 
When macrophages ingest organisms, they form vesicles around the organisms. In the 
absence of help from TH1 cells, macrophages are relatively inefficient at killing these 
organisms. Resistant pathogens 
(e.g. Mycobacteria) can only be killed by activated 
macrophages. Macrophage activation requires both IFN-y produced by the T cell and inter- 
action of macrophage CD40 with T cell CD40L (Figure 1.17.3). This process is CENTRAL 
to the host response to pathogens that proliferate in macrophage vesicles.

a acts with IFN-y in the induction of toxic oxygen radicals. Activated macrophages also 
secrete IL-12, which enhances differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into TH1 effector cells. 
Activated TH1 cells produce cytokines that activate the macrophage and coordinate the 
immune response to intravesicular pathogens. TH1 cells enhance recruitment of phagocytic 
cells to the site of infection. IL-3 and GM-CSF stimulate production of phagocytic cells in

endothelium. Macrophage chemotactic factor-1 (MCP-1) attracts phagocytic cells to the 
site of infection. 
Chronically infected macrophages lose the ability to kill intracellular bacteria. Fas ligand 
(FasL) expression or TNF-8 produced by TH1 cells can kill these macrophages, releasing 
engulfed bacteria to be taken up and killed by other macrophages. 
When antigen persists, for example, due to microbial resistance 
a chronic TH1 
dominated cellular response ensues. This characteristically produces a central area of 
infected macrophages surrounded by activated lymphocytes, called 
a GRANULOMA. 
Regulation of macrophage activation avoids damaging healthy tissue 
76 
Tight regulation of macrophage activity by TH1 
cells allows specific and effective 
deployment of potent mechanisms of activated macrophages, while minimising local tissue 
damage. Control mechanisms include the following: 
* 
T cell synthesis of IFN-y limited by short half-life of mRNA encoding IFN-y. 
* 
Focal delivery of IFN-y to point of contact of TH1 cell with macrophage limits effect 
to infected macrophage. 
¢ 
Inhibition by cytokines including TGF-8, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 which are produced by 
TH2 cells. 
HELPER T CELL ACTIVATION 
_ EFFECTOR T CELLS FALL INTO THREE FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIES 
Protective immunity against pathogens in macrophage intracellular vesicles requires activated 
CD4 T cells. TH1 cells activate macrophages enabling them to kill these organisms. 
Extracellular pathogens include bacteria and multicellular parasites. Sterilising immu- 
nity to bacteria relies on the humoral immune response, and T cell help is required for opti- 
mal antibody production. IgE production, requires help from TH2 cells, which provides 
some protection against multicellular parasites. 
Intracellular pathogens multiplying in the cytoplasm activate cytotoxic T cells (TCs). 
Cytotoxic T cells kill infected target cells in minutes by releasing preformed proteins from 
their vesicles or inducing apoptosis (Figure 1.17.4). This is discussed in detail in Section 1.18.

Control of the Immune Response 
77 
Cytotoxic T Cells 
Cell mediated immunity involves two separate populations of T cells: helper T cells (THs) 
and cytotoxic T cells (Tcs). Viruses and some bacteria replicate in the cytoplasm of infected 
cells where they are inaccessible to antibodies. Cytotoxic T cells kill these infected cells 
either by inducing them to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) or by necrosis. 
Cytotoxic T cells also play a role in graft rejection and tumour immunity. 
Apoptosis results in DNA fragmentation and destruction of the cell from within. 
Apoptotic cells are rapidly ingested and digested by phagocytes, allowing efficient removal 
of cells without an inflammatory response. Cell death by necrosis results in inflammation. 
These mechanisms prevent the release of infectious viruses to infect other healthy cells. 
ACTIVATION OF NAIVE CD8 T CELLS 
Naive CD8 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T cells when they first encounter antigen 
(peptide: MHC) on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in lymphoid tissues 
(Figure 1.18.1). Proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells into armed effector 
cells depends on adequate co-stimulation and production of IL-2, in addition to TCR- 
peptide:MHC binding. 
Dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells express both classes of MHC as well as 
the co-stimulatory 
cell-surface 
molecules 
required. 
The 
double 
requirement 
of 
co-stimulation and IL-2 production can be met in two ways: 
@ 
Dendritic cells, which have high co-stimulatory activity, can directly stimulate CD8+ 
T cells to synthesise IL-2, which drives their own proliferation and differentiation. 
¢ 
During priming, helper T cells and naive CD8 T cells recognise related antigens on the 
surface of the same APC. The helper T cell induces higher expression of co-stimulatory 
molecules on the APC, which in turn activates the CD8 T cell to make IL-2. 
ACTIVATION OF ARMED EFFECTOR CYTOTOXIC T CELLS 
Once a CD8 T cell has differentiated into an armed effector cytotoxic T cell, response to its 
specific antigen does not require co-stimulation. This makes sense, as cytotoxic T cells must

be able to act on any cell infected with a virus whether or not it can express co-stimulatory 
molecules. 
Peptides derived from intracellular (cytoplasmic) microbes, are processed and presented 
bound to MHC Class I molecules on the cell surface, marking the cell for killing by cyto- 
toxic T cells. Interactions between adhesion molecules on cytotoxic T cells and on the target 
cell allow the cytotoxic T cell to scan cell surfaces for the presence of specific peptide: MHC 
complexes. The TCR binds the peptide;sMHC Class I complex. CD8 binds the non- 
polymorphic region of MHC Class I molecule. 
_ CYTOTOXIC MECHANISMS OF ARMED EFFECTOR CYTOTOXIC T CELLS 
Upon activation, cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis or necrosis of a virus infected cell by 
two mechanisms (Figure 1.18.2). 
Calcium dependent release of lytic granules 
The granules of Tcs contain effector proteins: perforin and proteases called granzymes. 
When Tcs recognise antigen on a target cell, the lytic granules release effector molecules by a

calcium-dependent mechanism. Perforins polymerise to form a pore through which the 
granzymes enter the target cell and can activate a cascade of enzymes inducing apoptosis. 
This mechanism may also result in cell death by necrosis. TCs can kill their targets rapidly 
because they store preformed cytotoxic proteins that reside in an inactive form in the lytic 
granules. 
Fas ligand also induces apoptosis 
Cytotoxic T cells (Tcs) can also kill target cells in a perforin-independent manner. Infected 
nucleated cells upregulate Fas expression. Activated Tcs upregulate their expression of FasL. 
Ligation of Fas on target cells by FasL activates caspases that induce apoptosis in the target cell. 
Activated cytotoxic T cells release cytokines 
In addition to releasing perforins and enzymes, cytotoxic T cells also produce immuno- 
stimulatory cytokines IFN-y, TNF-a and TNF-8. 
¢ 
IFN-y upregulates the expression of MHC Class I molecules and slightly inhibits viral 
replication. IFN-y also activates macrophages and recruits them to the site of infection 
as effector cells and as APCs. 
¢ 
TNF-a and TNF-B synergise with IFN-y in macrophage activation.

The Mucosal Immune System 
The mucosal surfaces are particularly vulnerable to infection. The immune system must 
avoid responding to food antigens, while still detecting and killing pathogens. The MALT 
lining the gut is known as gut-associated lymphoid tissue or GALT and includes tonsils, 
adenoids and Peyer’s patches. 
_ PEYER’S PATCHES 
Peyer’s patches facilitate induction of immune responses in the small intestine. Specialised 
epithelial cells called M cells form a membrane overlying the lymphoid tissue and take 
up antigens from the gut lumen by endocytosis. Antigens are transported through M cells 
and delivered directly to APCs (dendritic cells) and lymphocytes of the mucosal immune 
system. 
A DISTINCTIVE REPERTOIRE OF LYMPHOCYTES 
There are small foci of lymphocytes and plasma cells scattered widely throughout the 
lamina propria of the gut wall. These are effector cells of the gut mucosal immune system 
and the T cells can be divided into conventional af-T cells and y8-T cells. 
Naive lymphocytes leave the thymus and enter the mucosal immune system via 
the bloodstream. On encountering foreign antigens, lymphocytes 
are activated and 
traffic, via the lymphatics through mesenteric lymph nodes, to the thoracic duct and circu- 
late in blood throughout the entire body. They re-enter mucosal tissues including other sites 
of MALT (respiratory and reproductive mucosa). Hence immune responses initiated 
in Peyer’s patches are disseminated throughout mucosal sites. This pathway of lymphocyte 
trafficking is distinct from and parallel to that of lymphocytes in the rest of the lymphoid 
system. 
cot 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
SECRETORY IgA 
The major antibody isotype present in the lumen of the gut is secretory polymeric IgA, 
synthesised by lamina propria plasma cells and transported into the gut lumen. Polymeric 
IgA binds mucus overlying the gut epithelium, acting as an antigen-specific barrier to 
pathogens and toxins. 
MOST ANTIGENS PRESENTED TO THE MUCOSAL 
IMMUNE SYSTEM INDUCE TOLERANCE 
82 
The mucosal lymphoid system is exposed to many foreign antigens from foods and 
commensal bacteria to pathogenic microbes and parasites. Immune responses to food anti- 
gens are rarely detected. Feeding foreign antigens leads to specific, active unresponsiveness — 
known as oral tolerance. In contrast, pathogenic microorganisms induce strong TH1 
responses. 
The context in which peptide is presented to T cells of the mucosal immune system 
appears to determine whether tolerance or a powerful adaptive immune response ensues. 
In the absence of inflammation, presentation of peptides to T cells by MHC molecules on 
APCs occurs without adequate co-stimulation. However, pathogenic organisms induce 
inflammatory responses, which stimulate maturation and expression of co-stimulatory 
molecules on APCs. Subsequent antigen presentation favours development of a TH1 
response.

Immune-mediated Gastrointestinal Disorders 
Initiation of the Immune 
Response 
When pathogens breach natural defences and overcome innate immunity, an adaptive immune 
response develops over several days, which as well as eliminating the organism usually, 
generates immunological memory and pathogen-specific protection in the future. 
NON-SPECIFIC RESPONSES OF INNATE IMMUNITY ARE REQUIRED 
FOR INITIATION OF AN ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
Infection, and the responding innate immune system produce changes in the immediate 
environment, which are essential in initiating an adaptive immune response. 
Macrophage activation-changes in vascular endothelium 
Bacterial components, such as LPS, activate macrophages. Cytokines and chemokines 
released by actiyated macrophages 
initiate inflammation, enhancing adhesiveness of 
vascular endothelium. Neutrophils and then monocytes stick to blood vessel walls and 
migrate to the site of infection. Later, these changes in vascular adhesiveness permit the 
arrival of effector T cells. 
Activation of professional APCs 
Dendritic cells (DCs) take up antigen and are activated through innate immune receptors 
(CD14 and TLRs). DCs mature into potent APCs with increased expression of MHC Class 
II and co-stimulatory molecules and are carried in lymph away from infected tissue to 
secondary lymphoid tissues. Here DCs initiate an adaptive immune response by activating 
antigen-specific naive T cells, which then divide and mature into effector cells that re-enter 
the circulation. Effector T cells leave blood vessels and migrate to the site of infection 
facilitated by the increased adhesiveness of blood vessels at sites of inflammation. 
83 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
WHEN T CELLS ENCOUNTER ANTIGEN IN LYMPHOID TISSUES, 
AN ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE IS INITIATED 
The immune system includes several anatomically distinct compartments each capable of 
responding to pathogens in particular sites: 
¢ 
Peripheral lymph nodes and spleen respond to antigens entering tissues or blood. 
¢ 
Mucosa-associated immune system (MALT) responds to mucosal antigens. 
¢ 
Two additional compartments are body cavities (peritoneum and pleura), and the skin. 
Immune responses generated in one compartment are predominantly effective in that 
compartment. Lymphocyte homing receptors are adhesion molecules that bind ligands 
expressed within individual compartments. 
Initiation of immune responses in lymph nodes illustrates the sequence of events 
common to all secondary lymphoid tissues (Figure 1.20.1). Activated DCs carry antigen to 
the lymphoid tissues. The architecture of peripheral lymphoid organs through which naive 
T cells recirculate, optimises the chance of antigen-specific T cells encountering their cognate 
antigen on APCs. 
Lymphocytes cross high endothelial venules 
Lymphocytes enter lymphoid tissue from blood by crossing the walls of high endothelial 
venules (HEVs). Lymphocyte expression of L-selectin facilitates homing to lymphoid tis- 
sues, by binding GlyCAM-1 and CD34 on HEVs. Chemokines produced in lymph nodes 
induce lymphocyte expression of LFA-1, which binds endothelial ICAM-1 
allowing 
lymphocytes to migrate across the endothelium. 
Antigen recognition and non-recognition 
T cells arriving in the T cell zone scan the surface of DCs for specific peptide: MHC com- 
plexes. If they do not recognise peptide: MHC complexes they leave the lymph node via the 
efferent lymphatic vessel and continue to recirculate. 
When naive T cells recognise peptide; MHC on DCs, LFA-1 is activated and the T cell 
adheres strongly to the DC. Binding to peptide: MHC and co-stimulatory molecules on the 
DC stimulates the T cell to proliferate and differentiate, producing armed antigen-specific 
effector T cells. 
Lymphocyte re-circulation and recognition is efficient, enabling all antigen-specific naive 
T cells to be trapped by antigen in one node within two days. Within days of antigen 
arrival, large numbers of activated effector T cells (helper or cytotoxic T cells) exit the lymph 
node via the efferent lymphatics. 
c 
DIFFERENTIATION OF CD4T CELLS IS INFLUENCED 
BY THE CYTOKINE ENVIRONMENT 
84 
Interaction of different pathogens with dendritic cells, macrophages, NK cells and NK-T cells 
influences the cytokine environment early in the immune response, determining whether CD4 
T cells differentiate into TH1 or TH2 cells and the subsequent type of immune response. 
The early response to viruses and some intracellular bacteria includes secretion of IL-12 
(DCs and macrophages) and IFN-y (NK cells and CD8 T cells), which skew CD4 T cell 
differentiation towards TH1 cells. IFN-y also inhibits the proliferation of TH2 cells.

IL-4 and IL-6 promote differentiation of CD4 T cells into TH2 cells. IL-4 is produced by 
mast cells and some NK-T cells in response to parasitic worms or other pathogens. The 
exact mechanisms of these processes are not fully understood. 
ARMED EFFECTOR T CELLS ARE GUIDED TO SITES OF 
INFECTION BY ADHESION MOLECULE EXPRESSION 
Activation of naive T cells takes several days during which their homing behaviour is 
altered. Armed effector cytotoxic CD8 T cells travel from lymphoid tissues to attack and 
destroy infected cells. Armed effector CD4 TH1 cells leave the lymphoid tissues to activate 
macrophages at the site of infection. 
Most armed effector T cells replace L-selectin expression, which mediates homing to 
lymph nodes, with VLA-4 (an integrin which binds activated endothelium) expression. 
85 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
Products of the innate immune response activate endothelium at sites of infection facilitat- 
ing extravasation of VLA-4 expressing activated lymphocytes. 
Differential adhesion molecules expression directs subsets 
of effector T cells to specific sites 
Compartmentalisation of the immune system requires populations of lymphocytes to 
migrate through different lymphoid compartments and the different tissues they serve. This 
is achieved by selective expression of lymphocyte homing receptors that bind tissue-specific 
addressins. 
¢ 
T cells that home to the lamina propria of the gut express LPAM-1 and L-selectin, 
which bind to MAdCAM-1 on vascular endothelium. 
¢ 
Tells that home to the epithelium of the gut express ®@EB7, which binds E-cadherin on 
epithelial cells. 
¢ 
Tells that home to the skin express cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) and bind 
E-selectin. 
Effector T cells that enter the tissue but do not recognise their antigen are rapidly lost. They 
either re-enter the bloodstream or undergo apoptosis. 
ANTIBODY RESPONSES DEVELOP UNDER THE DIRECTION OF 
ARMED HELPER T CELLS IN THE LYMPHOID TISSUES 
Humoral immune responses to protein antigens require help from antigen-specific T cells. 
They induce B cells to produce antibody, switch isotype and induce affinity maturation of 
the antibody. This involves surface contact between T and B cells (cognate interactions) and 
cytokine production both occurring in the lymphoid tissues. The migratory path of naive 
antigen-binding B cells through lymphoid tissues brings them into contact with helper T cells, 
and T-B cell interaction allows B cells to proliferate, form germinal centres, and differentiate 
into plasma cells.

* 
Becells bind specific antigen, receive signals from helper T cells and proliferate to form 
a primary focus. 
* 
Inthe absence of T cell signals, B cells die within 24 hours. 
¢ 
Some activated B cell blasts migrate to the medullary cords of lymph nodes, divide and 
differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibody for a few days, before undergoing 
apoptosis. 
¢ 
Other B cell blasts migrate into primary lymphoid follicles and proliferate rapidly to 
form a germinal centre. These B cells undergo isotype switching and affinity matura- 
tion before either becoming memory cells or leaving the germinal centre to become 
long-lived antibody producing plasma cells. 
- 
B cells leaving the germinal centres are called pre-plasma cells (10% leave, those remaining 
die) and migrate to bone marrow where they differentiate into plasma cells with a life span 
of months to years. 
INITIATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
RESOLUTION OF AN INFECTION 
When an infection is eliminated by the adaptive immune response, effector cells are 
removed by apoptosis and rapidly cleared by macrophages. Some effector cells are retained 
and generate memory B and T cells.

Maintenance of the Immune 
Response 
Effective adaptive immunity results in protective immunity and immunological memory. 
Vaccination produces protective immunity against a particular pathogen. 
Immunological memory allows the immune system to respond more rapidly and 
effectively to pathogens previously encountered. Activation of naive T and B cells in 
response to antigen is called a primary immune response. In addition to producing effector 
T and B cells, memory T and B cells are generated. These are long-lived specialised cells 
capable of an accelerated response to subsequent challenge by the same pathogen. Memory 
responses are secondary, tertiary and so on depending on the number of subsequent 
exposures to antigen. Memory lymphocytes play a prominent role in secondary responses 
with only a minor contribution from newly activated naive lymphocytes (Figure 1.21.1). 
_ MEMORY B CELLS 
Secondary antibody responses produced by memory B cells differ from primary antibody 
responses. In primary responses, low affinity antibodies are produced by plasma cells derived 
from a large number of precursor B cells. The secondary response is generated from fewer 
high-affinity precursor B cells that have undergone clonal expansion. 
Antigen-specific memory B cells differ quantitatively and 
qualitatively from naive B cells 
88 
¢ 
After priming, there are 10- to 100-fold more memory B cells that can respond to 
antigen than naive B cells.

Memory B cells produce antibody of higher affinity than unprimed B cells.

Most memory B cells have switched to IgG, IgA and IgE. The beginning of a secondary 
antibody response is characterised by the production of these isotypes.

Memory B cells express higher levels of MHC Class II molecules. Increased affinity 
for antigen and increased MHC Class II expression facilitate antigen uptake and

presentation. This allows memory B cells to interact with helper T cells more 
efficiently, at lower doses of antigen. 
Memory B cells re-circulate through the same secondary lymphoid organs as naive B cells, 
principally the follicles of the spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. 
Increased antibody affinity (affinity maturation) in memory B cells 
Memory B cells produce antibody of higher affinity than unprimed B cells and affinity con- 
tinues to increase during secondary and subsequent antibody responses. This progressive 
increase in affinity involves two mechanisms. 
Somatic hypermutation 
Memory B cells migrate to follicles and become germinal centre B cells. They enter a second 
proliferative phase in which V domain DNA randomly mutates (termed somatic hypermuta- 
tion) before these B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. 
Germinal centre selection 
Memory B cells making higher-affinity antibodies are selected for further clonal expansion 
and differentiation. In the secondary response antibody already produced is available to bind 
antigen marking it for phagocytes. Memory B cells with high affinity antigen-receptors 
(BCRs) compete with pre-existing antibody to bind antigen. As antigen becomes limiting 
only the highest affinity B cells receive activation signals through the BCR. Thus the affinity 
of the antibody produced rises progressively for the secondary and subsequent responses. 
MEMORY T CELLS 
The number of T cells reactive to a given antigen increases markedly after priming and then 
falls to a level 100- to 1000-fold higher than prior to priming. These long-lived memory 
89 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
T cells have distinct surface molecule expression, response to stimuli, and expression of 
genes that control cell survival. Many of the cell-surface markers that distinguish memory 
T cells from naive T cells are also shared with effector T cells. These molecules increase 
T cell adhesion to APCs and endothelial cells and increase sensitivity to antigen stimulation. 
Memory CD8T 
cells 
Cyotoxic T cells programme target cells for lysis in about 5 minutes, however memory 
CD8 T cells need to be reactivated and require an induction period of 1-2 days to become 
cytotoxic.

Increased expression of CD44 — activation marker

Memory CD4T 
cells 
90 
Memory CD4 T cells are long-lived cells that share characteristics similar to effector CD4 
T cells, however, they require additional re-stimulation before acting on target cells. 
Significant changes in cell surface proteins on memory T cells compared to naive T cells 
include: 
¢ 
L-selectin is lost 
* 
CD44 expression is increased 
* 
CD45 isoform changes from CD45RA to CD45RO. 
Changes in L-selectin and CD44 expression direct the migration of memory T cells from 
blood into tissues and then into lymphoid tissues. CD45RO associates with the TCR 
facilitating antigen recognition. This receptor complex transduces signals more effectively 
than the TCR-complex on naive T cells. After re-exposure to antigen on an APC, memory 
T cells become armed effector T cells acquiring characteristics of TH1 or TH2 cells 
(secreting IL-4 and IL-5, or IFN-y and TNF-B, respectively).

BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
ANTIGEN 
Antigen initiates immune responses. Microbes are recognised by pattern recognition 
receptors of the innate immune response and antigen-specific receptors of the adaptive 
immune response. 
Antigen is required to drive the immune response 
When antigen is removed, the 
immune response subsides. Once a pathogen is eliminated most armed effector T cells 
die and antibody levels decrease. The antigen that elicited the response is no longer 
present at levels required to sustain the response 
—- a mechanism known as feedback 
inhibition. 
The nature of the antigen is important 
The size, state (particulate or soluble), 
composition (protein or carbohydrate), dose and route of entry of antigen, affect the type 
and strength of immune response elicited. 
The amount and sequence of peptide initiating the response influences differentiation of 
CD4 T cells into distinct effector subsets 
Large amounts of peptide, presented in high- 
density on APC surfaces stimulate TH1 responses, while low-density presentation elicits 
TH2 responses. Peptides that bind TCR strongly stimulate TH1 responses, while those binding 
weakly stimulate TH2 responses. 
ANTIBODY 
IgM 
IgG 
Preformed antibodies inhibit host responses to antigens 
The presence of preformed antibody at the time of antigen exposure influences subsequent 
antibody formation. 
The interaction of antigen—IgM-complement complexes with antigen- specific antibody 
(BCR) stimulates the B cell more efficiently than antigen alone. 
Interaction of IgG—antigen complexes with antigen-specific B cells results in simultaneous 
binding of BCR and FcyRII and delivers a negative signal to the B cell. This feedback 
inhibition decreases the amount of antibody being produced. 
« 
Transfer of maternal IgG across the placenta during foetal development gives the infant 
maternal IgG-mediated humoral immunity at birth. As long as maternal antibody persists 
in the infant’s circulation it binds and removes antigen. This provides passive protection but 
slows development of endogenous immunity. 
GENETIC CONTROL 
92 
Many genes are involved in immune regulation including genes encoding cytokines, 
receptors and signalling proteins, as well as MHC molecules. An individual’s MHC 
molecules (HLA type) determines the repertoire of peptides to which they can respond. 
CONTROL OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
HELPER T CELLS 
The type of immune response generated depends on the nature of the antigen, how it is 
presented, and the type of cytokines produced by CD4 helper T cells. TH1 cells are crucial 
for activating macrophages while TH2 cells are the most effective activators of B cells. 
These two subsets crossregulate each other: 
¢ 
IL-10 and TGF-B, TH2 cell products, inhibit development of TuH1 cells. 
@ 
IFN-y, a TH! cell product, prevents activation of TH2 cells. 
If a particular CD4 T cell subset is activated first it can suppress the development of 
the other subset. However, under many circumstances, there is a mixed TH1 and TH2 
response. 
TH3 CELLS AND Tr1 CELLS 
The development of regulatory T cells in the mucosal immune system induces tolerance, 
actively suppressing antigen-specific responses following antigen re-challenge: 
@ 
TuH3 cells produce IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-B on stimulation with antigen. 
# 
TR1 cells produce TGF-f in an IL-10 dependent manner.

This pattern of cytokine secretion in response to antigen-specific stimulation inhibits the

NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM: THE HPA AXIS 
The hypothalamus/pituitary/adrenal axis (HPA) controls the immune system through the 
release of mediators such as corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), opioids, cate- 
cholamines and glucocorticoids. Cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a directly affect the

Ontogeny of the Immune 
Response 
The ‘normal’ immune system in infants and young children is immature, and children are 
predisposed to infectious diseases. Exposure to a massive range of foreign antigens 
occurring in the normal post-natal environment is essential for immune maturation. 
In addition, microbial encounter in infancy influences lifelong immune response patterns. 
IN UTERO DEVELOPMENT 
Immune cells are produced from the first trimester of pregnancy. The main sites are: 
* = Yolk sac initially 
* 
Liver and spleen — active haemopoietic sites until birth 
* 
Bone marrow — predominant site from the second trimester and remains so for life. 
Intra-uterine infection stimulates antigen-specific antibody production. While functional, 
the prenatal immune response is suboptimal. Infections that are typically mild in the 
immunocompetent child or adult (rubella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV)) can 
cause overwhelming illnesses in the foetus. Impaired antigen presentation, altered cytokine 
production and limited lymphocyte proliferation compared with adults are just some of the 
factors underlying this susceptibility. 
Transplacental transfer of maternal IgG (but not IgM) occurs progressively from the early 
second trimester through to birth. Maternal antibody provides passive immunity until 3-6 
months after birth. Endogenous antibody production takes over at this time. Premature infants 
are usually antibody-deficient in early life because of restricted transplacental antibody transfer. 
INFANCY — A PERIOD OF PHYSIOLOGICAL IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
All key immune response components are present at birth, but optimal concentrations and 
functional capacities are only achieved after further post-natal development. The age at 
which immune competence is reached varies for individual components. 
950) 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
96 
Natural defences and innate responses are not fully functional in neonates. Deficiencies 
are particularly relevant in premature infants. Anti-microbial chemicals (e.g. lactofer- 
rin, complement proteins etc.) are not expressed at adult levels until some time after 
birth. Skin and mucous membrane barriers are less efficient. 
Commensal microbial colonisation in the early post-natal period is a critical factor in 
protection (or predisposition) to gastrointestinal infections. Operative delivery and 
artificial feeding increase colonisation with disease-causing gastrointestinal microbes. 
Breast-feeding confers protection against infection. 
Breast milk IgA and specific 
anti-microbial enzymes like lactoferrin, and cytokines such as TNF-a mediate this 
protection, 
Cell-mediated immunity — there are many quantitative and qualitative differences in 
newborn T lymphocytes and APCs compared with adult cells. In practical terms 
full-term, healthy infants are adequately protected against most viral and other 
intracellular organisms commonly encountered. 
Antibody-mediated immunity — suboptimal antibody predisposes to infection in early 
life. Pyogenic infection 
is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children 
<5 years. Four million children die annually, mainly in developing countries, as 
a result of pneumococcal infection alone. Meningococcal infection is particularly 
prevalent in this age-group. Viral infections, although typically trivial, impact hugely 
on well-being of young children. 
— A physiological trough in immunoglobulin levels (‘transient hypogammaglobuli- 
naemia of infancy’) and predisposition to infection occurs normally at 3-6 
months. This is due to falling maternal Ig levels and poor endogenous production. 
— 
Initially, antibody production is mainly of IgM isotype with adult concentrations 
reached by about 12 months. 
— 
IgG production 
is poor until the latter half of the first year. Near-adult 
concentrations of IgG are not reached until the second year. 
— 
Endogenous IgA production is slow and may only reach adult levels by 10 years 
of age. 
The response to particular antigenic structures (e.g. proteins, lipopolysaccharides, 
polysaccharides) is age-dependent. 
— 
Production of antibodies against protein-based antigens is T-dependent (TD). 
Adequate T cell help is available from birth. Response to challenge with TD anti- 
gens is intact and protein-based vaccines (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio) 
are effective from early infancy. 
— 
Both lipopolysaccharide- and polysaccharide-based antigens induce antibody 
production without T cell help — T-independent (TI) responses. TI-1 responses to 
LPS-based antigens (universally expressed by gram negative bacteria) are intact 
even before birth. 
— 
The onset of antibody responsiveness to polysaccharide, or TI-2 antigens is 
delayed. Limited TI-2 responses are detectable from 6 months of age, with 
adequate responsiveness reached by 5 years. Pyogenic bacteria surrounded by 
polysaccharide capsules are resistant to destruction in the absence of antibodies. 
Poor antibody responsiveness underlies frequent infection with these organisms at 
this stage of life. 
— 
Polysaccharide — protein conjugate vaccines (e.g. HiB, MenC conjugates) are 
effective 
in infant immunisation programmes. 
Vaccine 
protein conjugates 
stimulate T cell responses 
to ‘help’ polysaccharide-specific B cells produce 
antibodies. Pure polysaccharide vaccines are ineffective in children less than 
2 years. 
ONTOGENY OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
_ THE INFANT MICRO-ENVIRONMENT — SHAPING IMMUNE 
RESPONSIVENESS 
At birth, cytokine responses generated by activated T cells are naturally skewed towards a 
TH2-type pattern. There is growing evidence that microbial encounters early in life are 
essential in re-directing infant T cells towards TH1 or TH3-regulated cytokine patterns. 
High levels of LPS, intracellular infections and some viral infections appear to be particu- 
larly important in stimulating TH1 and TR responses. The very hygienic environments in 
which western children are raised limits exposure to infective stimuli and is believed to con- 
tribute to the growing prevalence of TH2-mediated allergy. Manipulation of the infant 
microenvironment such that TH2 responses are regulated has huge potential in relation to 
allergy prevention. This is an area of intense research interest currently. 
THE AGEING IMMUNE SYSTEM 
Variable alterations in immune function are reported in the elderly. These variations 
underlie some important disease predispositions seen in this population. The impact of 
confounding illnesses on results of immune parameters cannot be disregarded. Well- 
conducted studies are needed to identify the precise impact of age rather than disease on 
elderly immune functioning. 
Infections caused by pathogenic microbes such as influenza and Streptococcus pneumo- 
niae are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Effective vaccines are 
available for both infections, but responsiveness in the elderly is diminished in comparison 
with younger individuals. Despite this, benefits of vaccination programmes in the elderly 
are proven and should be encouraged, especially in frail and debilitated patients. 
Numerical and functional defects in T and NK cells and impaired immune surveillance 
may be important in higher rates of malignancies seen in the elderly. Certain haematologi- 
cal malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) are especially prevalent in older people. Secondary antibody deficiency disorders 
predisposing to recurring pyogenic infections are common in these disorders. 
Immune dysregulation with higher baseline inflammatory mediators but impaired 
responsiveness to microbial challenge are seen and partly explain the propensity to 
overwhelming sepsis syndromes in the elderly. 
Auto-antibody production, especially low affinity IgM antibodies, occur with increased 
frequency with increasing age. Autoimmune 
diseases do not occur with increasing 
frequency though. Careful interpretation and correlation of autoimmune serology results in 
the elderly is critical. 
The roles of the immune system in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and 
atherosclerosis are areas of intensive research. Immunomodulation may become an impor- 
tant additional therapeutic approach in these major causes of morbidity and mortality in 
the Western world.

Immune Responses 
to Infection 
Preceeding sections have described individual elements of the immune response. This 
section describes the immune response to viral, bacterial and mycobacterial infection. The 
purpose is to integrate information learned in the preceding sections. 
VIRAL INFECTION 
98 
Viruses enter the body, gaining access to cells following adhesion to the cell surface. Once 
in the cell cytoplasm, the virus hijacks the host cells’ protein synthesis machinery to produce 
viral proteins. The virus then assembles particles that can bud from the cell surface, and 
infect more cells. Viruses have a short extracellular phase in their life cycle, however, usu- 
ally the virus is in the cytoplasm. Viral proteins are subject to protein degradation by pro- 
teosomes, and similarly to self-peptides, viral peptides are transported to the endoplasmic 
reticulum, incorporated into MHC Class I molecules and displayed on the cell surface. 
Thus in order to cause infection, a virus must 
¢ 
Enter the body 
¢ 
Adhere to and enter host cells 
¢ 
Produce viable viruses capable of infecting other cells. 
: 
Viral infection of a cell may lead to cell lysis, syncytium formation and occasionally to 
tumour formation. The course of a viral infection and the host immune response will be 
considered using influenza as an example. 
Influenza is spread by inhaled droplets, containing viable virus. The first challenge faced by 
the virus is to adhere to the respiratory epithelium. The host’s first line of defence is the 
mucociliary elevator, which traps the virus in mucus, while cilia waft the mucus to the orophar- 
ynx to be expectorated or swallowed. If the host has previously encountered the same strain of 
influenza, neutralising antibodies, particularly IgA, present in respiratory secretions may prevent 
adhesion of the virus to respiratory epithelial cells. 
Viral neuraminidase reduces the viscosity of mucus, and in the absence of antibodies may 
allow the virus to bind to and enter respiratory epithelial cells. Once the virus has entered 
IMMUNE RESPONSES TO INFECTION 
the cell, Type I IFNs (IFN-a and -f) are produced by infected cells. Influenza replicates very 
rapidly within the cell, however, replication is slowed down by these IFNs. Additionally 
IFNs have a paracrine effect on neighbouring cells, inhibiting viral entry and reducing protein 
synthesis making it difficult for the infecting virus to replicate. 
Some viruses cause a reduction in HLA Class I expression on the surface of cells in an 
attempt to become invisible to the hosts T cells. NK cells are normally held in check by the 
presence of host HLA Class I on cells, and reduced HLA Class I expression may lead to 
killing of the infected host cell by NK cells. IFNs also enhance NK cell activity. NK cells 
produce IFN-y, which activates T cells and biases differentiation towards a TH1 response. 
Injury of respiratory epithelium causes an inflammatory response resulting in an influx 
of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. Uptake of virus particles or proteins facilitates 
antigen presentation by resident dendritic cells or macrophages (APCs). In a primary 
immune response the dendritic cells normally migrate to the draining lymph nodes. Intact 
antigen is also carried in lymph. Lymph node structure increases the chance of antigen- 
bearing APCs meeting their cognate T and B cells. T cell activation leads to clonal 
expansion and differentiation of cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells. B cells are also 
activated and mature into plasma cells, producing antibody. 
Antigen-specific T cells and antibody exit the lymph node in the blood stream. T cells 
activated by mucosal antigen are programmed to home to mucosal sites. Additionally the 
presence of inflammation at the site of infection delivers more antibody and lymphocytes 
to the site. Peptide-specific cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells. Antibody may limit the 
ability of budding virus to enter other uninfected cells, and also plays a role in preventing 
future infection by the same virus. 
Once the virally infected cells are killed, symptoms rapidly resolve and inflammation 
resolves slowly. It takes approximately 4 weeks for the ciliated respiratory epithelium to 
normalise completely, and during this time the host is more vulnerable to bacterial 
infection. This secondary bacterial infection causes death in vulnerable subjects during 
influenza epidemics (Figure 1.24.1).

BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
BACTERIAL INFECTION 
Bacteria must also bypass the body’s natural defences to cause infection. This may result 
from ineffective mucociliary function, obstruction of urinary flow or breaches in skin 
integrity. Once natural defences are breached, bacteria usually remain in the extracellular 
compartment. The innate immune response includes activation of complement (by the 
alternative pathway). However, bacterial capsules inhibit complement deposition, allowing 
encapsulated bacteria to evade complement activity. Bacteria can be phagocytosed by 
neutrophils and macrophages, however, this system 
is inefficient 
in the absence of 
opsonisation. Natural opsonins such as C reactive protein and mannan binding lectin bind 
some bacteria. MBL activates complement via the lectin pathway and also independently 
opsonises organisms. 
As bacteria proliferate and die, bacterial antigens are released and carried in lymph to 
the lymph nodes. Intact antigen and APCs that have ingested antigen, travel to the drain- 
ing lymph node. Both T and B cells are activated. T cell help is essential for B cells to 
undergo affinity maturation and isotype switching. Antibody may be produced locally or 
after plasma cells have migrated to the bone marrow. Antibody enters the blood stream, 
and delivery of antibody as well as complement and inflammatory cells is enhanced by 
inflammation at the site of infection. 
Antibody binding to bacteria activates complement via the powerful classical pathway, and 
this may result in lysis of susceptible bacteria. Antibody also opsonises bacteria, facilitat- 
ing bacterial ingestion by phagocytic cells. Antibody and complement act synergistically as 
opsonins. Ingestion of bacteria by healthy phagocytic cells results in bacterial killing and 
digestion. 
Antibody reduces the risk of future infection by the same bacterium, as neutralising 
antibody prevents bacterial adhesion to cells, and preformed antibody may kill a small 
innoculum of bacteria before clinically apparent infection occurs. 
MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTION 
100 
There are over 60 species of mycobacterium known, the majority of which do not cause 
disease 
in humans. Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis 
and Mycobacterium 
leprae cause 
tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy, respectively. 
Usually M. tuberculosis 
enters 
the body via the respiratory 
tract, 
although 
gastrointestinal TB may also be seen. Once inhaled, mycobacteria may be cleared by the 
mucociliary elevator. However, if mycobacteria gain access to the lung, they are taken up 
by macrophages through recognition of mycobacterial lipoproteins by Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs). Within the phagosome the mycobacterium is relatively resistant to lysis because of 
a waxy protective capsule, as well as its ability to inhibit fusion of lysosomes with the 
phagosome. Failure of lysosome fusion prevents acidification of the phagosome and 
inhibits killing of the mycobacterium. Thus the innate immune response is relatively 
ineffective at killing M. tuberculosis. However, cells of the innate immune response play 
a pivotal role in activating the adaptive response. 
Macrophages secrete IL-12 and present antigen, eliciting 
a TH1 response. TH1 cells 
produce IFN-y and TNF-a, 
further 
activating macrophages 
and enhancing 
the 
macrophages ability to kill mycobacteria. TH1 induced macrophage maturation results in 
granulomatous inflammation, and the infection is usually sealed off. The centre of granu- 
lomata may become hypoxic and undergo necrosis (termed “caseous necrosis”). It is 
common for some mycobacteria to persist for years or decades within granulomata, while 
the host remains in good health. However, mycobacterial infection may become reacti- 
vated, usually within the lungs, if macrophage function is even moderately inhibited — for 
IMMUNE RESPONSES TO INFECTION 
example by steroid treatment, malnutrition or other immunosuppressive therapy. More 
profound immunosuppression with TNF-a blockade, HIV, or potent immunosuppression 
may allow widespread reactivation, which spreads beyond the lungs. This demonstrates 
that an on-going TH1 driven response is essential to maintain lifelong control of a 
tuberculous lesion. 
In order to cause infection all organisms must bypass the body’s natural defences. Once a 
pathogen enters the body, the innate immune response immediately aims to control an 
infection. The adaptive immune response is slower but more effective in eliminating 
infection. The type of pathogen determines which elements of the innate and adaptive 
immune responses contribute to sterilising immunity. Cells of the innate immune response 
frequently activate the adaptive response. Additionally the adaptive immune response can 
harness many of the effector mechanisms of the innate response. 
101 
How Organisms Evade 
the Immune System 
Organisms that overcome natural defences enter body tissues and face a battle with the 
innate and adaptive immune responses. Organisms that win this battle (some of the 
time) are pathogens that cause disease. Successful pathogens frequently evade the immune 
response 
(Figure 1.25.1). Strategies include hiding, camouflage, decoys, evading key 
immune effector mechanisms and disabling the attacking immune response. 
Organisms divide rapidly — often within hours — and therefore genetic variation can occur 
extremely rapidly. The immune system, which can generate diversity and select appropriate 
clones rapidly, must keep pace with changes in organisms if the host is to eliminate the 
pathogen. Immunological memory greatly increases the effectiveness of the adaptive immune 
response; however, organisms frequently change key molecules to bypass the memory response. 
Other strategies aim to overcome specific protective mechanisms. 
HIDING FROM THE IMMUNE SYSTEM 
Organisms can ‘hide’ from the immune system by entering a latent phase, often within cells 
of an immunologically privileged site. For example, herpes viruses can remain latent for life 
within nerve cells. Cytomegalovirus ‘hides’ by taking up host antigen, appearing as self to 
the immune system. Several viruses downregulate expression of HLA (MHC) molecules, 
reducing the ability of the infected cell to present viral peptide: MHC complexes to T cells. 
Some organisms camouflage themselves by closely mimicking human antigens, to which 
the host is tolerant. These organisms include some Streptococcus species (which express 
antigens cross reactive to heart, brain and joints). An effective immune response to such 
organisms carries a risk of inducing autoimmunity. 
- EVADING MEMORY BY VARIATION AND DIVERSITY 
The adaptive immune response is highly specific and changing even one amino acid in an 
immunodominant molecule may allow an organism to evade the memory response. When

this change is compatible with survival of the organism, the pathogen gains an advantage. 
The rapid evolution of the influenza virus necessitates annual preparation of influenza 
vaccine from components of the current strains. 
Variation in the influenza virus may be subtle, which is termed antigenic drift or more 
dramatic, which is termed antigenic shift. Antigenic drift is a constant, ongoing process 
resulting from mutations often in key adhesion molecules. Once neutralising antibodies to 
‘virus type A’ have been developed this virus subtype cannot adhere to respiratory epithe- 
lium. However, if a mutation occurs giving rise to ‘virus type B’ the neutralising antibodies 
are no longer effective, and ‘virus type B’ can then infect people with effective immunity to 
‘virus type A’. Antigenic shift occurs when a subject is infected with two related viruses 
simultaneously — for example, human and avian influenza viruses. If exchange of genetic 
material between the viruses occurs, a dramatic change in the makeup of both viruses 
results. If the new virus is still capable of infecting humans it will spread rapidly, as few if 
any of the population will have effective immunity. This is frequently the basis for influenza 
epidemics and pandemics (epidemics which spread around the world). 
Organisms also evade the secondary immune response by the presence of multiple 
serotypes each varying only slightly. For example over 50 serotypes of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae are described. Previous infection with Type I only provides protection from 
reinfection by Type I and not the 50+ other serotypes. 
Organisms may also vary expression of different antigens at different stages of their 
life-cycle — thus by the time effective immunity develops to antigens present in the original 
infecting organism, these antigens may no longer be present. In malaria infection, many 
103 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
antibodies that bind the sporozoite (which infects the liver) will not bind the merozoites, 
which infect the red blood cells. 
The surface of Trypanosoma brucei (which causes sleeping sickness) is made up of 
identical molecules 
of variable surface glycoprotein 
(VSG). The trypanosome 
has 
approximately 1000 different types of VSG encoded in its genetic material. When effective 
immunity to the first type of VSG develops, the organism switches to expression of a 
different VSG that the immune system cannot recognise — effectively changing its coat. 
DECOY MOLECULES 
Several immune mechanisms are effective within a short distance only — thus activating the 
immune system some distance from the organism is ineffective and wastes the immune 
system’s recources. Plasmodium falciparum, which causes a severe form of malaria, releases 
large amounts of decoy protein. This mops up large amounts of antibody, leaving less to 
bind organisms. Complement activation when the antibody binds the decoy molecule is 
ineffective, as complement activity is spatially limited. 
EVASION OF KEY DEFENCE MECHANISMS 
Several organisms can inhibit key immune functions that may be effective in their disposal. 
Encapsulated bacteria, such as $. pneumoniae have a gelatinous capsule that prevents 
effective phagocytosis by phagocytic cells. Antibodies overcome this by binding to Fe 
receptors on phagocytes, however, these organisms cause repeated infection in patients with 
hypogammaglobulinaemia. 
Other bacteria have a variety of mechanisms, which can inhibit complement deposition: 
¢ 
Gram positive organisms have a thick capsule which resists complement deposition. 
¢@ 
Pseudomonas can cleave C3a and CSa, anaphylatoxins which attract neutrophils to 
the site of infection. 
¢ 
Leishmania can expel the formed membrane attack complex from its surface. 
_ DISABLING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM 
104 
HIV very effectively disables the immune system, as it destroys CD4+ helper T cells. 
However, other organisms disable components of the immune system in a variety of ways: 
¢ 
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) produces 
a viral IL-10, which downregulates cellular 
immune responses. 
¢ 
Adenovirus inhibits IFN release. 
¢ 
Staphylococcus aureus produces toxins which can kill phagocytic cells. 
Organisms have developed several mechanisms to evade the immune response. The immune 
system often overcomes these escape mechanisms and frequently other components of the 
immune response can compensate where a specific function is inhibited. Investigation of 
pathogen escape mechanisms has helped us understand how the human immune system 
functions, and the relative importance of different components of the immune response.

How Does the Immune System See Antigen? 
Consequences of 
an Immune Response 
Evolution of the immune system has facilitated the elimination of pathogens, however this 
usually generates an inflammatory response. Inflammation contributes to tissue injury, may 
become chronic and can cause scarring and long-term damage to organs. Additionally the 
immune response to an infection can cause immunopathology, even inducing autoimmu- 
nity. Occasionally the immune response is triggered by inappropriate stimuli such as self- 
antigens or non-pathogenic substances (allergens such as pollens or foods). Possible 
outcomes of an immune response are shown in Figure 1.26.1. 
The immune response to infection is characterised by acute inflammation. When the 
immune response is effective the organism may be eliminated, allowing resolution of 
inflammation and restoration of health. Usually recovery is complete and the affected 
organ is not damaged. For example, S. pneumoniae pneumonia causes severe pulmonary 
inflammation, but complete resolution is usually seen. Even in the pre-antibiotic era, the 
majority of patients who survived had no residual lung damage. A successful immune 
response that clears the infection may be associated with some residual scarring. For exam- 
ple, infection with pyogenic organisms may be localised by the immune response giving rise 
to a localised abscess. This can burst and discharge, but usually some scarring will result. 
Despite the immune response a large innoculum of a virulent organism may result in ful- 
minant infection and death. Patients may also die of the effects of acute inflammation in 
response to infection — for example, in acute epiglottitis when the inflamed epiglottis can 
obstruct the airway. 
The immune response may be unable to eliminate the organism, particularly in infections 
with organisms that reside in vesicles within cells, such as mycobacteria. When the organism 
cannot be eliminated chronic inflammation ensues. This allows the infection to be controlled, 
however, this is at the expense of ongoing tissue injury. Chronic inflammation is associated 
with ongoing fibrosis and repair at the site of inflammation. Ongoing fibrosis results in scar- 
ring and tissue damage. If the chronic inflammatory response is suppressed the infection may 
reactivate. Initiation of steroid therapy in patients who have inactive tuberculosis may result 
in reactivation of their infection. 
Immunopathology (damage to tissues or organs due to the action of the immune system) 
can result from the immune response to infection. The damage caused by the immune 
system may be greater than that caused by the organism itself. For example, hepatitis B is

a non-cytolytic virus and does not kill liver cells. However, a vigorous immune response to 
the virus results in liver injury, chronic inflammation and eventually scarring and cirrhosis. 
Antibodies formed as part of the humoral immune response may also contribute to 
tissue injury. When antibodies bind bacterial antigens immune complexes form and can get 
trapped in tissues causing inflammation (Type III hypersensitivity; see Section 1.29). Common 
examples include complications of subacute bacterial endocarditis, and post-streptococcal 
glomerulonephritis. 
The immune response to a pathogen can also induce true autoimmunity. If pathogens 
express antigens that are closely related to self-antigens, the immune response to the 
pathogen may cross-react with self-tissues. The ensuing autoimmune reaction may persist 
even after elimination of the pathogen. Rheumatic fever may follow infection with strains 
of Streptococci and is due to molecular mimicry between the organism and antigens 
expressed in joints, skin, brain and heart. 
Immune responses to allergens result in a particular type of acute inflammatory response 
characterised by marked oedema initially and a late eosinophilic infiltrate. Continued 
exposure to the allergen results in chronic inflammation that can result in scarring and 
permanent structural change in affected organs. 
Autoimmune responses frequently cause chronic inflammation and if untreated usually 
result 
in scarring and organ damage. Occasionally autoimmune -disease may be 
characterised by acute inflammation in the early stages, however, this usually is only 
detected clinically in severe autoimmune responses that rapidly damage tissues.

Host Defence Against Tumours 
Malignant tumours (or cancers) are characterised by uncontrolled cell division, and they 
can invade into adjacent tissues and spread to distant sites. Malignant cells usually have 
multiple DNA mutations, which remove normal controls on cell division and survival, 
allowing proliferation of the abnormal cells. Malignant cells can be carried by lymph or 
blood to distant sites where they establish new foci of cancerous growth, a mode of spread- 
ing called metastasis. 
Chemical and physical agents that damage DNA, increasing the mutation rate, are called 
mutagens. Carcinogens are mutagens associated with cancer. Prolonged exposure to 
carcinogens, including some chemicals, ultraviolet light and radiation increase the risk of 
malignant transformation or cancer. 
Viruses that can induce malignant transformation of cells are called oncoviruses. 
Oncoviruses frequently encode proteins that interfere with mechanisms for regulating cell 
division, impairing control of proliferation in infected cells, for example, EBV is associated 
with B cell malignancies. 
Mutations in two main classes of gene contribute to malignant transformation: 
¢ 
Proto-oncogenes — involved in initiation and execution of cell division. 
¢ 
Tumour suppressor genes — encode proteins that prevent unwanted proliferation of 
mutant cells, for example, p53 is expressed in response to DNA damage and results in 
apoptosis. 
_ TUMOUR ANTIGENS 
Transformed cells have genomic differences that distinguish them from other cells. Some 
mutations in tumour cells produce antigenic changes on the tumour cell surface that may 
be recognised by the immune system — tumour antigens. 
¢ 
Tumour specific antigens (TSA) are present on tumour cells and not on normal cells. 
TSAs can derive from viral proteins. 
107 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
¢ 
Tumour associated antigens (TAA) are expressed on tumour cells and on normal cells. 
TAAs can derive from proteins produced in larger amounts by tumour cell, for exam- 
ple, proteins involved in cell division. They are also derived from the re-expression of 
proteins normally only expressed on embryonic cells, for example, carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA). 
IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE 
The primary defence against cancer is well-controlled cell division. Mechanisms that have 
evolved to ensure this include DNA repair systems and mechanisms that prevent the survival 
of cells with badly damaged DNA. When malignant transformation occurs, the immune 
system may be able to eliminate the abnormal cells before a tumour becomes established.

HOST DEFENCE AGAINST TUMOURS 
Immune surveillance describes the immune system’s ability to detect tumour cells and 
destroy them. Immunodeficient patients have an increased tumour incidence, however, 
most tumours occur despite normal immune function. Most tumour types that occur with 
increased frequency in immunodeficiency are virus-associated tumours. Therefore, while 
immune surveillance is critical for control of virus-induced tumours, the immune system 
has limited ability to respond to other tumours. 
Effector mechanisms 
Anti-tumour immune responses may develop in the same way as immune responses against 
pathogens or foreign antigens. 
¢ 
Tumour antigens (TSAs and TAAs) are presented as peptides bound to MHC Class I 
molecules, making tumour cells targets for cytotoxic CD8 T cells. 
¢ 
Changes in tumour-cell surface also produce tumour antigens recognised by B cells and 
antibodies. 
* 
NK cells kill tumour cells not expressing sufficient MHC Class I molecules. 
¢ 
Antibody coated tumour 
cells may be killed by complement activation, by 
macrophages and PMNs via phagocytosis and/or by antibody dependent cellular cyto- 
toxicity (ADCC). 
Although some tumour specific CD8 cytotoxic T cells and antibodies can be detected in cancer 
patients, cancers are rarely controlled or eliminated by the immune response (Figure 1.27.1). 
This is probably because most tumours do not make distinctive antigenic proteins and do not 
express co-stimulatory molecules necessary to initiate an adaptive immune response.

BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
TUMOUR MECHANISMS OF ESCAPE 
110 
Tumours have other ways of avoiding or suppressing the immune responses. 
Low immunogenicity 
Most tumours do not express novel proteins that can activate the 
immune system. Others have suppressed MHC molecule expression. Tumour cells express- 
ing little or no MHC Class I on their surface can avoid recognition by cytotoxic T cells. 
Tumour cells rarely express adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules, required to activate 
naive T cells. 
Antigenic modulation 
Some tumour cells initially express antigens which generate an 
immune response. Tumour antigens are lost from the cell surface by antibody-induced inter- 
nalisation. This permits tumour cells lacking the antigen to evade FcR bearing effector cells. 
Selection for tumour antigen negative variants 
As tumours grow, their cells acquire 
different mutations, which may generate mutants that do not express tumour antigens. 
Cytotoxic T cell responses kill cells presenting tumour antigens, thus selecting for variant 
tumour cells that do not express the antigen. 
Tumour-induced immune suppression 
Tumours release TGF-f or IL-10, which have 
immunosuppressive properties. TGF-B suppresses inflammatory T cell responses and cell 
mediated immunity needed to control tumour growth and may even directly enhance 
tumour growth (Figure 1.27.2). IL-10 reduces dendritic cell development and activity. 
Tumour cells sometimes express FasL, which binds Fas on T cells resulting in apoptosis. 
Autoimmunity 
A healthy immune system mounts effective immune responses against pathogens, but does not 
attack normal tissues. Tolerance describes the lack of immune response to antigen(s). Self- 
tolerance, the lack of response to self-antigens, is an essential attribute of the healthy immune 
system. A breakdown of self-tolerance may lead to autoimmune disease. 
Autoimmune reactivity must be distinguished from autoimmune disease. Autoimmune 
reactivity is common, particularly in women and older people. Autoimmune reactivity 
means that autoantibodies and/or autoreactive T cells are present, without detectable organ 
dysfunction or inflammation. Autoimmune disease is present when there is (or has been) 
inflammation, usually associated with organ dysfunction, driven by the immune system in 
the absence of external stimuli. 
Organ-specific autoimmune diseases occur when the autoantigen is expressed in a 
particular organ, which is the sole target of the immune response. Examples include 
autoimmune thyroid disease and myasthenia gravis. Non-organ specific autoimmune 
disease occurs when the autoantigen(s) are not tissue-specific, and the immune response can 
damage several organs. Examples include systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid 
disease. 
_ TOLERANCE — A BRIEF REMINDER! 
The mechanisms involved in maintaining tolerance are described in previous sections. 
Self-tolerance is primarily maintained at the level of T cells, however, mechanisms of 
deleting and inactivating autoreactive B cells have been described. 
T cell tolerance is divided into central tolerance (thymic deletion of autoreactive T cells) 
and peripheral tolerance, which includes mechanisms that delete, inactivate or regulate 
T cells after exit from the thymus. Central tolerance is a ‘leaky process’ with occasional 
autoreactive T cells escaping negative selection even in healthy individuals. In patients who 
are genetically predisposed to autoimmune disease, thymic selection may be defective, with 
reduced expression of self-peptide or inability of those individuals’ MHC molecules to 
present peptides that are present. Defective negative selection may reduce the number of 
111 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
autoreactive T cells deleted in the thymus and consequently increased numbers of 
autoreactive T cells migrate to the periphery. 
Autoreactive T cells in the periphery are generally controlled by mechanisms of 
peripheral tolerance, including 
Lack of co-stimulation 
Naive T cells respond to antigenic peptide presented in the 
context of MHC Class II molecules, together with co-stimulatory signals delivered by 
CD40, and the B7 family of molecules. Tissues normally express MHC Class I, but expres- 
sion of MHC Class II may be induced. However, co-stimulatory molecules are not present. 
When a naive T cell encounters peptide in the absence of co-stimulation it becomes aner- 
gic (remains viable but fails to respond). 
Regulatory T cells 
Several T cell subsets which play a regulatory role have been 
described in recent years. Specific markers for regulatory cells have not yet been validated. 
Regulatory T cells usually express activation markers, and many secrete TGF-B with or 
without IL-10. 
Autoreactive T cells may not cause tissue damage if antigen is expressed only in an 
immunologically privileged site. Immunological privilege may be due to physical sequestra- 
tion of the antigen (the lens of the eye is non-vascularised and T cells have no access). 
Additionally, expression of Fas results in apoptosis of activated T cells. For example, only 
activated T cells, which express FasL, can cross the intact blood-brain barrier. Expression of 
Fas by glial cells causes apoptosis of these cells via the Fas programmed cell death pathway. 
B cells cannot mature and produce high affinity antibodies without T cell help, and 
therefore T cell tolerance prevents production of high affinity IgG autoantibodies. 
Additionally some autoreactive B cells are deleted in the bone marrow, and may also be 
anergised in the periphery. However, the importance of these B cell tolerance mechanisms 
in preventing autoimmune disease is not well established. 
AUTOIMMUNITY 
Autoimmune reactivity may be seen in healthy individuals, usually limited to low affinity 
IgM autoantibodies produced by the B-1 subset of B cells. B-1 cells produce antibodies 
without genetic recombination and do not show affinity maturation or isotype switching. 
Such antibodies are rarely associated with disease, with the exception of rheumatoid factor. 
Autoimmune disease is associated with pathogenic T cells or high affinity (usually IgG) 
autoantibodies, 
resulting from 
a breakdown 
of T cell tolerance. Well-documented 
mechanisms whereby T cell tolerance is broken include (Figure 1.28.1): 
Molecular mimicry (Rheumatic fever)

Some organisms have antigens which are sufficiently different to self to elicit an immune 
response, but sufficiently similar to self for cross-reactivity to occur. For example, infection 
with some types of Streptococcus can lead to development of rheumatic fever (see 
Section 2.14). Antibodies and T cells directed against the streptococcus cross-react with 
self-tissue, leading to inflammation in joints, heart and brain, in the absence of the

organism. Antibody binding to tissues can be prevented by adsorption with Streptococcus, 
proving the presence of true cross-reactivity. 
Release of sequestered antigen 
Some antigens are not seen by the immune system, such as proteins present in parts of the 
eye. As peptides from these proteins are not expressed in the thymus, T cells capable of 
reacting to them are not deleted. Following a penetrating eye injury, physical separation of 
the immune system from the eye is bypassed. Development of an immune response to these 
tissues may damage the uninjured eye. This is called sympathetic ophthalmitis and preven- 
tion of this devastating cause of blindness requires rapid enucleating of the injured eye or 
potent immunosuppression to prevent development of the autoimmune response. 
A related mechanism is the availability of cryptic epitopes to activate the immune sys- 
tem. DNA from necrotic cells is normally cleared extremely rapidly, and therefore usually 
does not elicit an immune response. If this clearance mechanism is defective, these cryptic 
antigens are present in increased quantities for prolonged periods and can stimulate an 
immune response. 
Altered self 
Binding of a hapten to a self-molecule can alter the self-molecule sufficiently to bypass 
tolerance and elicit an immune response. This occurs in penicillin-induced haemolytic 
113 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
anaemia. Usually the immune response switches off once the hapten is no longer available 
(i.e. penicillin is stopped and metabolised). However, occasionally the immune response 
includes antibodies capable of binding to carrier protein alone, and true autoimmune 
disease may result. 
Polyclonal activation of T cells 
Superantigens result in activation of whole families of T cells, and this powerful activation 
may overcome the ability of regulatory T cells to control the occasional autoreactive T cells. 
Toxic shock syndrome is caused by a Staphylococcal superantigen activating 30-40% of an 
individual’s T cells, and has been associated with 
a number of autoimmune diseases in 
patients who survive the original disease. Kawasaki syndrome is a vasculitic illness that 
mainly affects children; this disorder frequently follows infection with Staphylococcus or 
Streptococcus. It is thought to result from release of autoreactive T cells from regulatory 
control, facilitated by massive T cell activation induced by bacterial superantigens. 
Tissues may acquire the ability to present antigen competently 
114 
Infection of a tissue results in recruitment of macrophages, which may provide the 
cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules normally not found in the tissue. Expression 
of MHC Class II may be induced on cells which normally do not express this molecule. 
The presence of self-peptide in HLA Class II molecules on cells in peripheral tissues, 
together with macrophage-derived co-stimulation may initiate an autoimmune response. 
Viral infection of pancreatic islets is thought to play a role in inducing type I diabetes 
mellitus (DM).

Hypersensitivity Induced by Pathogens 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions occur when the immune system mounts an excessive response to 
a stimulus. This includes an excessive response to an infectious agent or a response to self- 
antigen resulting in autoimmune disease. More commonly, hypersensitivity refers to reac- 
tions against non-pathogenic environmental stimuli, such as house dust mite, pollens, foods 
and drugs. 
Gell and Coombs originally classified hypersensitivity reactions in the 1960s, based on 
the immunological mechanisms involved. This classification remains 
a very useful 
framework for considering many aspects of immunopathology. 
Many of the examples shown in Table 1.29.1 are predominantly due to a single type of 
hypersensitivity mechanism. In several diseases, more than one type of hypersensitivity 
mechanism may be involved, and different manifestations of the same disease may be due 
to different mechanisms. Joint destruction in rheumatoid disease is predominantly T cell 
mediated; however, rheumatoid vasculitis is immune complex mediated. Extrinsic allergic 
alveolitis (EAA) is a chronic lung disease caused by hypersensitivity to a variety of inhaled 
antigens. Common examples of EAA include farmers’ lung (due to hypersensitivity to 
Micropolyspora faeni spores), and pigeon fanciers’ lung (hypersensitivity to proteins in 
pigeon droppings). However, hypersensitivity to a long list of antigens have been implicated 
in this disorder. Most patients have precipitating antibodies to the offending antigen, which 
led to the theory that EAA was due to Type III hypersensitivity with immune complex for- 
mation in the lung when inhaled antigen complexed with precipitating antibody. However, 
histology of affected lungs showed granulomatous inflammation, indicating the involve- 
ment of T cells (Type IV hypersensitivity). Type IV hypersensitivity is now thought to be 
the major cause of lung damage in EAA. 
Most types of immunopathology can be classified according to the above scheme, 
however in some disorders other mechanisms of tissue damage may occur. The mechanism 
of tissue damage in ANCA-associated vasculitis probably involves Type IV hypersensitiv- 
ity, however additional novel mechanisms may be present. Similarly cytokine release 
syndromes induced by pathogens (toxic shock syndrome) or drugs (OKT3) represent 
additional mechanisms of tissue injury (Figure 1.29.1).

TYPE 1 HYPERSENSITIVITY 
Type I hypersensitivity results in rapid clinical manifestations, and underlies many disorders 
widely recognised as ‘allergies’ such as hay fever and asthma. In individuals predisposed to 
Type I hypersensitivity, antigen exposure leads to IgE production. IgE binds Fe receptors on 
mast cells, packed with granules containing histamine and other preformed mediators. IgE 
cross-linking by allergen causes degranulation of mast cells and rapid release of mediators 
(Figure 1.29.1). This type of reaction is discussed in more detail in the subsequent sections. 
TYPE Il HYPERSENSITIVITY 
Type II hypersensitivity is caused by cytotoxic antibodies binding to components of cells or 
tissues or antigen/hapten which has become intimately associated with cells. Usually IgG is 
involved and complement activation follows. Anaphylatoxins are produced and attract 
inflammatory cells to the site of antibody binding. In Goodpasture’s disease antibodies to 
glomerular basement membrane (GBM) bind to basement membrane in kidney and lung. 
Bound antibody cannot be removed by phagocytosis and intense inflammation results. 
Antibodies may bind and affect the function of key molecules on a cell as in myasthenia 
gravis where antibodies bind to acetylcholine receptors at the motor end plate, reducing the 
ability of nerve impulses to activate muscles. Antibodies may activate cells; in Graves’ 
disease antibodies bind to the TSH receptor and induce thyroxine production leading to 
hyperthyroidism. 
TYPE Ill HYPERSENSITIVITY 
116 
Type III hypersensitivity results from formation or deposition of immune complexes (ICs) in 
tissues. ICs may be formed in the blood and trapped in tissues, or may be formed in situ if 
soluble antigen binds autoantibody. When antigen binds antibody, complement is activated 
and neutrophils and other inflammatory cells are attracted. Phagocytic cells ingest the ICs, 
however, when the capacity to clear complexes is exceeded, inflammation may occur.

Immune complex formation occurs in healthy individuals during infections and even 
after eating. However, in health immune complexes are cleared and do not cause inflam- 
mation. Antibody binding to antigen activates complement, and C3 cleavage products 
become incorporated into the immune complex lattice. C3 fragments bind to C3 receptors 
on red blood cells (RBCs), which then carry the immune complexes. RBCs move in the 
centre of blood vessels due to laminar flow of blood, and hence immune complexes are not 
normally in contact with blood vessel walls. In the spleen, phagocytic cells remove and 
ingest the immune complexes without damaging the RBCs. However, immune complexes 
may cause disease when this system is overwhelmed by excessive production, or when the 
capacity to dispose of immune complexes is reduced by complement deficiency or reduced 
numbers of complement receptors. Additionally immune complexes formed in situ depend 
on the clearance capacity of local macrophages. If the capacity of resident macrophages is 
exceeded, inflammation results. 
117 
BASIC IMMUNOLOGY 
TYPE IV HYPERSENSITIVITY 
118 
Type IV hypersensitivity is due to activation of cellular immunity and the onset of clinical 
manifestations 
is typically delayed by 48-72 hours. Antigen is taken up by antigen 
presenting cells (APCs), which then migrate to regional lymph nodes. Following antigen 
processing, APCs present antigen to responsive T cells, which proliferate and mature. 
Antigen specific TH1 cells then migrate to the periphery and when they encounter antigen 
are further stimulated. They secrete IFN-y which activates macrophages, and both T cells 
and macrophages contribute to the inflammatory process. When antigen is persistent, this 
process can result in granulomatous inflammation. 
The Gell and Coombs classification of hypersensitivity is a useful framework to use 
when considering many aspects of immunopathology, however, more than one mechanism 
may be relevant to a single disease. Additionally other methods of tissue injury may occur.

Describe several types of allergic diseases 
Atopy and Allergic 
Inflammation 
Atopy is a predisposition to generate IgE-mediated responses to environmental allergens. 
Atopy has a significant genetic component, inheritance being polygenic. When both parents 
are atopic over 50% of their children will also be atopic, however, 10% of children of non- 
atopic parents are atopic. The prevalance of atopy has increased rapidly, even within a single 
generation. This implies significant environmental influences. 
Allergy describes an inappropriate immune response to a non-pathogenic antigen. The 
term allergy is often used synonymously to describe atopic reactions. Allergy is a broader 
term including all mechanisms of hypersensitivity. However, as atopic reactions are 
extremely common, and other types of allergic reactions are rare, most allergic reactions 
are atopic. 
Production of IgE frequently leads to Type I hypersensitivity reactions. Clinically this 
type of immune response is associated with asthma, eczema, rhinitis, urticaria, angioedema 
and anaphylaxis. Clinical manifestations of atopic inflammation will be discussed in 
Sections 2.1 to 2.5. This section will explain mechanisms underlying this form of 
inflammation (Figure 1.30.1). 
PHASE | — SENSITISATION 
On initial exposure to allergen, no clinical manifestations occur. Antigen is presented to the 
immune system and TH2 cells are produced. TH2 cells promote production of IgE, rather than 
other types of antibody. IgE binds to high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells. Mast cells con- 
tain granules packed with histamine, tryptase and other inflammatory mediators and when 
stimulated produce leukotrienes and a number of cytokines. 
PHASE Il - EXPOSURE AND EARLY PHASE 
Once mast cells are coated with allergen-specific IgE, reactions may occur on subsequent 
allergen exposure. Cross-linking of surface-bound IgE activates the mast cell, leading to

rapid degranulation (Figure 1.30.1). Histamine and leukotrienes are prominent early 
mediators and cause vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, itch and bronchocon- 
striction. Vasodilatation causes swelling of tissues, erythema of skin and if generalised, 
hypotension. Increased vascular permeability in the skin causes wheals seen in an urticarial 
reaction, and angioedema when subcutaneous tissues are involved. In the airway, mucosal 
oedema contributes to airway narrowing in acute asthma. 
PHASE II] — LATE PHASE OF ATOPIC INFLAMMATION 
Leukotrienes and cytokines produced by the mast cells attract monocytes, eosinophils and 
T cells to the site of inflammation. By 6-12 hours a mixed inflammatory response with 
abundant eosinophils is seen at the site of allergen exposure. Eosinophil products prolong 
the inflammatory response. The IL-4 rich environment predisposes to further TH2 cell 
development and subsequent IgE production. After repetitive exposure to an allergen, the 
inflammatory late phase of the response may become chronic. Once this occurs, histamine 
plays a minor role, with eosinophils playing a major role in tissue injury (Figure 1.30.2). 
Tissue remodelling may occur, leading to irreversible changes. 
Clinically, the late phase of the inflammatory response causes recurrence of symptoms, 
often with a severity comparable to the initial symptoms. Thus a patient who responds to 
treatment initially for an acute asthmatic attack may deteriorate significantly a few hours 
later, if appropriate treatment is not given.

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
INTRODUCTION 
This part describes many immunological conditions commonly encountered in practice. These 
include allergic disorders, immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders, transplantation and 
lymphoproliferative disorders. This is not intended to be a comprehensive textbook of 
medicine — it provides brief outlines of conditions particularly focussing on immunological 
aspects of the disease. Case histories are included, as well as self-assessment questions.

Clinical Manifestations 
of Atopy 
Atopy is a genetic predisposition to produce IgE in response to antigen. An IgE response to 
allergens is necessary, but not sufficient to produce clinical manifestations of atopy. Not 
everyone who is atopic develops atopic disease, as environmental influences are also 
important. Sensitisation to a single allergen can occur, but the majority of atopic individu- 
als become sensitised to multiple allergens. Asthma, rhinitis and eczema comprise the 
so-called ‘atopic triad’. 
In utero, the developing immune system is biased towards TH2 responses. In non-atopic 
individuals this rapidly switches to predominantly TH1-type responses, while atopic 
children continue to develop TH2 responses for a prolonged or indefinite period. The 
reasons for this are poorly understood. 
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
Atopy is common, and the incidence is rising. A family history is a significant risk factor 
for the development of atopy. Approximately 60% of children with two atopic parents and 
40% of those with one atopic parent develop atopic disease. However, 10% of children in 
families where neither parent is atopic also develop atopic disease. 
Environmental factors in early childhood appear to greatly influence whether atopic 
disease will develop. Children with older siblings, or attending nurseries appear less prone 
to developing atopic diseases, possibly due to increased exposure to infection early in life. 
It has been suggested that better hygiene with decreased infection rates contributes to the 
increased prevalence of allergy — the so-called ‘hygiene hypothesis’. Other environmental 
factors thought to contribute include early exposure to allergens (house dust mite and pet 
dander as well as outdoor allergens), dietary allergens (particularly highly allergenic foods 
such as milk, egg, nuts and fish), and pollution including cigarette smoke. 
Approximately 15% of children in Western countries suffer from asthma, 15% have 
rhinitis, and 10% have eczema. Epidemiological studies record a significantly increased 
prevalence of asthma over the last three decades.

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS 
The classic atopic triad consists of asthma, eczema and rhinitis, but atopic individuals also 
have an increased incidence of urticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis. The following sec- 
tions describe many atopic disorders; however, a brief outline of rhinitis and eczema is 
included in this section. 
Rhinitis 
Rhinitis means inflammation of the nasal airways. This may result in sneezing, itch, con- 
gestion, nasal blockage, disturbed smell and taste and occasionally nasal polyps. Allergic 
rhinitis is commonly accompanied by conjunctivitis. Rhinitis may be infective, allergic or 
non-allergic (Table 2.1.1). 
The diagnosis of rhinitis is based on history. Clinical examination excludes nasal polyps 
or a deviated septum as the cause of obstruction. Skin prick tests (SPTs) or measurement of 
allergen-specific IgE to common aeroallergens is useful. 
Treatment consists of: 
¢ 
Allergen avoidance, where possible. 
¢ 
Topical nasal steroids, using a spray or drops. Nasal steroid sprays are ineffective if the 
nasal airway is obstructed. However, once patency is restored using nose drops, sprays 
are a more convenient maintenance therapy. 
¢ 
Non-sedating antihistamine may be added if required. 
Allergen immunotherapy appears to be effective for allergic rhinitis caused by mites, 
pollen or animal dander. It is very time-consuming for the patient and clinical staff, and 
may be reserved for when allergen avoidance is impossible and pharmacotherapy has 
failed. 
When rhinitis fails to respond to appropriate therapy, the diagnosis should be reviewed, 
particularly when nasal obstruction is the prominent symptom. Nasopharyngeal tumours, 
Wegener’s granulomatosus, nasal polyps, deviated septum, adenitis and the presence of 
a foreign body should be excluded.

Atopic eczema/dermatitis 
(AD) 
is a chronic inflammatory 
skin disorder 
affecting 
approximately 10% of children. There is considerable geographical variation in prevalence, 
with highest rates in Northern Europe and Australia. Approximately 40% of individuals 
with AD will have associated rhinitis and/or asthma, however, these atopic manifestations 
may appear later. 
AD usually begins in early childhood, and the majority of children outgrow it, although 
a small number experience recurrence during adolescence (Figure 2.1.1). It is rare to see 
new onset AD in adults, and most adults who have AD have had the disease since 
childhood. 
SPTs are positive in the majority of patients with AD, but allergens identified correlate 
poorly with symptoms. 
Allergen challenges have 
a better predictive value, and 
therefore putative allergens identified by SPT should be evaluated by food avoidance and 
challenge. Food allergy plays a role in approximately one third of AD patients, usually 
those with early onset of severe 
disease. The majority of positive food challenges 
involve egg, milk, wheat, soya and peanut. In adults, contact sensitivity may play a role in 
some patients with AD, and patch tests may be useful in assessing such allergens. Children 
with AD are at increased risk of infection, which may lead to an exacerbation of 
inflammation.

Asthma is a lung disease, characterised by reversible airway obstruction, airway inflammation 
and airway hyper-responsiveness to allergens and irritants. Asthma is frequently due to 
atopy, however, other causes account for 20-30% of cases. This section focuses on atopic 
asthma, although there are similarities with other types (Table 2.2.1). 
PATHOGENESIS 
Genetic factors play a role in determining both atopic tendency and predisposition to 
asthma. However, environmental factors also play a significant role.

133 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Airways obstruction in asthma is due to: 
¢ 
Contraction of airway smooth muscle 
¢ 
Inflammation of airway mucosa 
¢ 
Hypersecretion of mucus. 
Inflammatory mediators (histamine, leukotrienes, bradykinin and prostaglandins) and 
neural influences cause contraction of airway smooth muscle. Airway inflammation follows 
with eosinophil and TH2 lymphocyte infiltration. Inflammation increases the ratio of 
mucus-producing cells to ciliated cells in the airway. Increased mucus production coupled 
with decreased mucus clearance by ciliated cells causes accumulation of mucus in the 
airway, which may become plugged during severe 
attacks. 
Chronic bronchospasm 
eventually leads to hypertrophy of bronchial smooth muscle. Chronic inflammation leads 
to airway remodelling with thickening of the basement membrane and fibrosis. Long-term 
control of asthma is critically dependent on controlling airway mucosal inflammation 
(Figures 2.2.1 and 2.2.2). 
EPIDEMIOLOGY 
134 
Figure 2.2.1 Early and late phase of the allergic response to allergen challenge. 
The prevalence of asthma is rising, with approximately 15% of children and 5-10% of 
adults affected. While awareness is increased, it is generally accepted that the true preva- 
lence is rising. Prevalence has increased within one generation, which cannot be explained 
by genetic factors, implying a significant environmental component. Recent studies in 
Leipzig have shown that Westernisation of lifestyle is associated with a significant increase 
in childhood asthma.

CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS 
Asthma classically presents with episodic wheeze, breathlessness and cough. Symptoms 
usually show diurnal variation with ‘morning tightness’ — maximal wheeze and cough early 
in the morning, improving as the day goes on. 
Mild asthmatics may be apparently symptom-free for days or weeks. Generally, how- 
ever, there is mild airway inflammation even when symptom-free, with further inflamma- 
tion triggered by infection or increased allergen exposure. In more severe disease symptoms 
are present most days, but vary in intensity. 
In ‘cough variant’ asthma episodic or chronic dry cough is the only complaint. Exercise 
commonly precipitates wheeze or cough as the associated cooling and drying irritates the 
airway mucosa. However, particularly in children, exercise-induced wheeze may be the 
only symptom. 
DIAGNOSIS 
Asthma should be considered in patients with a history of cough and wheeze. Physical 
examination may be normal or wheeze may be audible on auscultation. Spirometry demon- 
strating airflow obstruction with >15% reversibility is diagnostic. Peak flow monitoring 
showing >20% variability is also suggestive of asthma. 
135 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
If no variability is evident, bronchial provocation testing with histamine may demon- 
strate airway hyperreactivity. When exercise-induced asthma is suspected, comparing peak 
flows before and after 6-10 minutes of running may establish the diagnosis. 
Measurement of IgE as well as SPT to determine specific allergies is of value. 
TREATMENT OF ASTHMA 
Treatment of asthma is aimed at: 
* 
Controlling airway inflammation 
¢ 
 Alleviating symptoms. 
When specific allergens are identified, allergen avoidance may make asthma easier to con- 
trol. However, allergen avoidance is demanding for the patient and often expensive to 
maintain. Unfortunately partial allergen avoidance is rarely beneficial. 
Short-acting By agonists relax airway smooth muscle and relieve symptoms. They may 
be used alone to treat mild intermittent asthma. Mild persistent asthma is usually treated 
with regular inhaled steroids, with a short-acting B) agonist as required. As disease 
becomes more severe prophylactic treatment is stepped up with: 
¢ 
High dose inhaled steroids 
* 
 Long-acting 8» agonists 
¢ 
Leukotriene antagonists. 
In severe asthma, sustained release theophylline and even oral steroids may be required to 
control airway inflammation. Short-acting B, agonists and also anti-cholinergic drugs are 
added as required to control symptoms.

Urticaria and Angioedema 
Urticaria is a rash characterised by itchy, well-demarcated erythematous papules. Lesions 
vary in size and each lesion lasts for a few hours. Angioedema is swelling of subcutaneous 
or submucosal 
tissues resulting from increased vascular permeability. Angioedema 
commonly occurs on the face, and when the larynx is involved respiratory difficulty may 
result. Angioedema in peripheral tissues, although uncomfortable is not dangerous. 
Acute urticaria/angioedema appears quickly (usually over minutes) and resolves within 
hours. Several episodes may occur, and if these continue for more than 6 weeks, the 
condition is classified as chronic. 
PATHOGENESIS 
Urticaria and angioedema result from similar mechanisms — the clinical difference results 
from the location of vascular changes. Urticaria results from mast cell activation and 
increased vascular permeability in skin, while angioedema results from increased vascular 
permeability in the subcutaneous tissues. 
Mast cells are packed with granules containing histamine, heparin and tryptase, and 
when activated produce leukotrienes and cytokines. IgE binds to high affinity IgE receptors 
highly expressed on mast cell surfaces. Cross-linking of IgE, chemical and physical stimuli, 
and complement components can trigger mast cells to rapidly release histamine and other 
inflammatory mediators. This results in vasodilation (which causes redness), increased 
vascular permeability (leading to wheal formation), and nerve ending irritation (causing 
itch). In about 30% of patients with chronic urticaria an autoantibody is present which 
binds the IgE receptor, directly triggering mast cell degranulation. 
Angioedema (without urticaria) can also occur in patients with excessive complement 
activation due to Cl inhibitor deficiency. The mechanism of angioedema is not fully 
understood, but bradykinin and thrombin are thought to be involved. Patients get 
subcutaneous and submucosal angioedema that may result in respiratory difficulty 
and severe abdominal pain. C1 inhibitor deficiency may be hereditary (due to deficiency or 
dysfunction of protein) or acquired (autoimmune, malignancy-associated) (Table 2.3.1).

ACUTE URTICARIA - AETIOLOGY AND INVESTIGATIONS 
Acute urticaria and angioedema (Figure 2.3.1) may be due to: 
¢ 
Allergy 
¢ 
Sensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
¢ 
Infections 
¢ 
Idiopathic. 
A thorough history of food and medications, occupational/hobby exposures, 
insect 
bites/stings and exposure to latex, chemicals, cosmetics and detergents is essential. Previous 
uneventful exposure does not exclude a causal role, however, uneventful exposure since the 
episode of angioedema and urticaria makes a causal role unlikely (Table 2.3.2). Selected 
skin tests or measurement of allergen-specific IgE are usually performed. Occasionally 
challenge tests may be required to confirm or eliminate a suspected allergen. 
CHRONIC URTICARIA AND ANGIOEDEMA 
138 
Chronic urticaria and angioedema appear indistinguishable from their acute counterparts, 
however, while individual lesions last less than 24 hours, the rash persists for several weeks. 
Causes of chronic urticaria differ from acute urticaria — in particular food allergy is rarely 
identified. A higher proportion of patients with chronic urticaria have idiopathic disease. 
Causes of chronic urticaria/angioedema include: 
¢ 
Idiopathic. 
¢ 
Physical causes — dermographism (induction of wheals on skin by physical stimulus — 
e.g. scratching), cold, cholinergic, heat, solar, aquagenic and delayed pressure urticaria. 
¢ 
Autoimmune (antibody to IgE receptor). 
¢ 
Food and food additives — salicylates in fruit and vegetables, azo-dyes, benzoates, 
inadvertent exposure to foods causing acute urticaria.

Urticarial vasculitis typically causes lesions lasting more than 24 hours that often bruise or 
become haemorrhagic. Typically in urticarial vasculitis systemic features are present, 
response to antihistamines is poor and an acute phase response occurs. C1 inhibitor defi- 
ciency causes chronic angioedema without urticaria. IgE mediated allergy is a rare cause of 
chronic urticaria and extensive allergy investigations is unrewarding. 
When the history suggests 
a physical urticaria, appropriate challenge may allow 
confirmation. More than one physical cause may be relevant in an individual patient. A 
history suggestive of food, chemicals, drugs or contact urticaria can be confirmed with 
challenges, SPTs or patch tests as appropriate and specific avoidance measures advised. 
When no cause is apparent from the history, physical examination and baseline investiga- 
tions including FBC, ESR, CRP, thyroid function, complement levels, ANA and ANCA 
should be undertaken. Antihistamines may control the symptoms. Skin biopsy may be 
useful in difficult cases. 
TREATMENT 
140 
Treatment of urticaria and angioedema includes: 
¢ 
Avoidance of any precipitating or exacerbating factors identified. 
¢ 
Antihistamines — non-sedating, long-acting agent with rapid onset of action. Addition 
of H2 antagonists is often useful. 
* 
Occasionally steroids may be required to treat severe acute urticaria. 
* 
Angioedema associated with respiratory compromise should 
be treated with 
adrenaline. Patients at risk of such episodes should be taught to use an adrenaline self- 
injector. Drugs which are contraindicated 
in combination with adrenaline 
(e.g. 
amitryptyline) 
or which inhibit the action of adrenaline (8-blockers) should be 
avoided. 
¢ 
Immunomodulatory therapies may be useful in specific circumstances — for example, 
IgE receptor autoimmunity. 
¢ 
Patients with chronic urticaria have significant impairment of their quality of life, how- 
ever, the majority of patients with chronic urticaria will ultimately settle.

Management of Acute Allergic Reactions 
Food Allergy 
Adverse reactions to food are common, occurring in 20-30% of the population, however, 
true food allergy affects only about 2%, being more common in children than adults. 
Adverse reactions to food may be classified as: 
* 
Food aversion — to a specific food or most foods in anorexia nervosa. 
¢ 
Food intolerance — non-immunological reaction to food including lactose intolerance, 
sensitivity to pharmacologically active components of food (monoamines in cheese; 
salicylates in some fruits and broccoli), and sensitivity due to metabolic disorders. 
¢ 
Non-IgE immunological reactions to food — coeliac disease. 
* 
IgE mediated allergy. 
Patients rarely distinguish between an allergy and intolerance. However, symptoms 
are often dose-related in food intolerance and effects are not life-threatening. IgE reac- 
tions to even minute quantities of allergen can provoke reactions which may be life 
threatening. 
IMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS 
Food is normally digested into amino acids, sugars and peptides, which are no longer 
immunogenic. Traces of intact proteins cross the normal gastrointestinal tract, normally 
resulting in production of small amounts of IgG antibodies. Mucosal IgA inhibits 
absorption and immune responses to food proteins. In childhood, gut permeability is 
increased and IgA responses sub-optimal. These factors may contribute 
to the 
increased prevalence of food allergy in infancy and early childhood. Atopic individuals 
respond to absorbed protein by production of IgE, which may lead to allergic 
manifestations. 
nat: 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
CLINICAL FEATURES 
Allergic reactions to food commonly involve the skin and gastrointestinal tract, although 
all organs may be involved. Common features include: 
¢ 
Acute urticaria and angioedema — occurring within minutes to hours after ingesting the 
food, and the history frequently suggests the diagnosis. Food allergy rarely causes 
chronic urticaria (2-5%). 
¢ 
Gastrointestinal symptoms — nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, often 
accompanied by more typical allergic features. In children symptoms may cause failure 
to thrive. 
¢ 
Anaphylaxis - common foods implicated include peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, eggs 
and milk, although any food may cause anaphylactic reactions. Minute quantities of 
food — for example, food fried in peanut oil or contamination of a meal by cooking 
utensils may cause severe reactions. Infection, exercise following the meal, alcohol, or 
NSAIDs can increase reaction severity. 
¢ 
Respiratory symptoms — wheeze, breathlessness, and cough may occur, usually as part 
of an anaphylactic reaction. Food allergy rarely causes isolated respiratory symptoms. 
Rarely in patients with asthma, occult food allergy contributes to the severity of 
symptoms. 
¢ 
Atopic eczema 
is related to food sensitivity in approximately one-third of cases 
(severely affected young children, most commonly). Exclusion diets improve the 
eczema, but have major nutritional and social consequences. Both IgE and delayed 
cellular mechanisms may be involved. 
¢ 
Oral allergy syndrome causes perioral rash, numbness and pruritus of the lips, tongue, 
and oropharyngeal mucosa and swelling of lips. Cross-reactions between fresh fruits 
and pollen are usually responsible. Progression to a systemic reaction is very unusual. 
Food allergies are often blamed for a myriad of symptoms such as fatigue, migraine and 
childhood behavioural 
disorders. Allergy does not cause 
these symptoms, although 
pharmacologically active amines in some foods may contribute to migraine. While it 
appears prudent to avoid a food that causes significant symptoms, allergy tests (evaluating 
IgE related pathology) are not helpful. It is important to encourage patients to critically 
re-evaluate nutritionally inadequate exclusion diets. 
INVESTIGATION OF FOOD ALLERGY 
142 
The history usually produces a shortlist of foods related to symptoms. SPT and/or specific 
IgE measurement is useful to confirm sensitisation (see Section 3.14). When symptoms are 
frequent, a detailed symptom and food diary may provide valuable clues. 
Food avoidance and challenge are used in several situations. To establish whether food 
allergy is playing a role in chronic/frequent symptoms a ‘few food’ or elemental diet may 
be used for a short period. If symptoms disappear, gradual food reintroduction adding two 
foods every S—7 days is subsequently undertaken. Should symptoms recur, the foods are 
eliminated and reintroduced one at a time. This procedure can be used to identify both food 
allergy and intolerances. 
Food challenge can 
be open 
or double-blind placebo-controlled 
food challenge 
(DBPCFC). The DBPCFC is the gold standard in food allergy diagnosis. Placebo or suspect 
foods are given in a double-blind manner and symptoms recorded. DBPCFC is important 
when there are no objective signs during a reaction. When objective signs occur, an open 
challenge is usually satisfactory. 
FOOD ALLERGY 
TREATMENT 
Treatment of food allergies requires avoidance. Elimination diets have major social and 
nutritional consequences and are only recommended for severe or dangerous allergies. 
Patient education is critical, as minute quantities of food may cause symptoms. Patients 
must check labels, and clarify all ingredients when dining out. Many restaurants purchase 
components of meals making it difficult to correctly establish whether a meal is free of a 
particular ingredient. 
Even the most conscientious patients will make errors, therefore an emergency plan with 
a fast acting antihistamine, and if appropriate adrenaline, must be implemented. 
Any patient requiring elimination of a staple food should have input from a dietician 
both for detailed education in allergen avoidance and to ensure nutritional adequacy. This 
is especially important in children.

Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that includes at least one life-threatening feature — 
hypotension, bronchospasm or laryngeal oedema. Anaphylactic shock means hypotension 
due to allergy, usually occurring with other allergic features. Anaphylaxis is due to IgE 
mediated mast cell activation. Clinically indistinguishable reactions occur when mast cells 
are triggered by mechanisms other than IgE cross-linking — these are called anaphylactoid 
reactions. 
WHAT CAUSES ANAPHYLACTIC REACTIONS? 
Anaphylaxis can result from allergen entering the body by any route. In extreme cases, 
smelling or touching the offending agent may trigger a reaction. Common precipitants 
include: 
¢ 
Drugs - penicillins, cephalosporins, anaesthetic agents including local anaesthetics 
¢ 
Foods - especially peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, egg, milk and soya 
* 
Venoms -— including bee and wasp 
2. 
Latex: 
Mechanisms involved in anaphylactoid reactions include: 
* 
Complement activation —- immunoglobulin and colloid infusions 
¢ 
Hypertonic solutions activating mast cells - X-ray contrast media 
* 
Unknown - non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. 
WHAT IMMUNOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ARE INVOLVED? 
The final common pathway of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions is mast cell 
activation. Release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators (including tryptase, 
chymase, heparin) causes the early phase of allergic reactions. Once triggered, mast cells 
144 
ANAPHYLAXIS 
synthesise prostaglandins, leukotrienes and cytokines involved in late phase responses. 
Because the immediate response is due to release of preformed mediators, the onset of 
anaphylaxis is within minutes of exposure to the allergen. 
CLINICAL FEATURES 
Anaphylaxis frequently affects many organ systems. Prominent symptoms and signs 
include: 
¢ 
Skin — flushing (due to vasodilation), itch, urticaria and angioedema 
* 
Upper airways — sneezing and laryngeal oedema 
¢ 
Lung — bronchospasm (contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, mucus production and 
oedema of airway mucosa) 
Heart — tachycardia and arrhythmias 
Cardiovascular — hypotension (vasodilation and increased vascular permeability) 
Gut — nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhoea (spasm of GI muscle) 
Nervous system — anxiety, dizziness, loss of consciousness. 
¢$¢¢ 
¢ 
INVESTIGATIONS 
A full and accurate history of all foods/drugs and exposures prior to the reaction is essential. 
Exposure is usually within a few hours and often minutes of the reaction. It is also important 
to identify any exacerbating factors that may have been present including: 
Infection 
Exercise 
Alcohol 
Non-steroidal agents 
8-blockers and ACE inhibitors. 
¢¢%¢ 
¢ 
@ 
Further investigations of allergic reactions are described in Section 3.14. 
Investigations are divided into: 
¢ 
Tests differentiating anaphylaxis from other disorders 
— 
Mast cell'tryptase 
— 
Urinary methylhistamines. 
¢ 
Tests to identify the allergen responsible 
— 
SPTs or intradermal skin testing 
— 
Allergen specific IgE. 
Full investigation of the cause of the reaction is not undertaken until the patient has 
recovered. 
If history and straightforward 
investigations 
fail to identify the cause, 
provocation testing may be required (see Section 3.14). 
TREATMENT 
Immediate treatment requires adrenaline as well as antihistamines and corticosteroids. 
Long-term management of patients includes education about allergen avoidance and 
145 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
emergency self-administration of adrenaline. It is also essential to ensure that asthma is 
maintained under good control, as poorly controlled asthma is a major risk factor for 
mortality in future attacks (see Section 4.13). 
Desensitisation to the allergen is possible in some situations (e.g. venom allergy) where 
avoidance 
of allergen 
is not possible and appropriate preparations 
are 
available. 
Desensitising protocols have been described for some drugs, but these procedures are 
labour-intensive and carry a risk of provoking anaphylaxis. Hence, desensitisation is 
usually reserved for patients where there is no alternative therapy available. 
Case 2.5.1 Nut allergy 
A 16-year-old girl was brought to A&E after developing a severe asthma attack while 
eating in a Thai restaurant. On admission she had severe bronchospasm, and was 
hypotensive (BP 90/50 mmHg). She had angioedema of the lips, and oropharynx and 
stridor was present. A diagnosis of anaphylaxis was made and she was immediately 
treated with intramuscular adrenaline, intravenous antihistamine and hydrocorti- 
sone. Nebulised 82-agonists and oxygen were also administered. She began to 
improve, and 15 minutes later her blood pressure was 120/60 mmHg, however, inspi- 
ratory stridor was still present. A second dose of adrenaline was administered with 
further improvement. 
She was admitted to hospital for further assessment and management. On review, 
she reported that she had stopped eating nuts some months ago as they caused an 
unpleasant tingling sensation in her mouth. She had a past history of eczema, and 
had asthma since the age of 5. She used inhaled steroids regularly but also needed 
daily rescue inhalers, indicating suboptimal control of her asthma. Skin prick tests 
showed positive reactions to peanuts, walnuts and almonds as well as house dust 
mite. A diagnosis of anaphylaxis secondary to nut allergy was made. The patient was 
given advice about nut avoidance, and was taught how to use a self-administered epi- 
nephrine pen. The importance of achieving good control of her asthma was stressed, 
and she was advised to wear a Medic-Alert pendant. Follow up in the Allergy clinic 
was arranged.

Other Types of 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Atopy is the basis of most allergic disorders (discussed in the preceding units), however 
other types of hypersensitivity can also give rise to allergic reactions. In this section, allergy 
due to Type II, Type III and Type IV hypersensitivity will be discussed (Figure 2.6.1). 
TYPE Il HYPERSENSITIVITY — CYTOTOXIC ANTIBODY 
Type II hypersensitivity results from binding of cytotoxic antibody to cells or tissue 
components. Drug-induced haemolytic anaemia often results from this mechanism. 
Penicillin acts as a hapten, binding red blood cells to form altered self. The penicillin/cell 
complex may stimulate antibody formation. On subsequent exposure to penicillin, anti- 
body binds to the hapten-red blood cell complexes and complement activation causes cell 
lysis. Antibody-coated red blood cells are also ingested by macrophages of the reticulo- 
endothelial system. 
Usually penicillin-induced haemolytic anaemia settles spontaneously when the drug is 
stopped. Occasionally antibodies are produced which bind red blood cells in the absence of 
the drug, resulting in true autoimmune haemolytic anaemia — self-tolerance has been 
broken. Haemolytic anaemia that persists after stopping the drug is treated in the same way 
as idiopathic autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (Section 2.16). 
TYPE Ill HYPERSENSITIVITY — IMMUNE COMPLEX DEPOSITION 
Type III hypersensitivity is due to immune complex deposition in tissues. Immune complexes 
may be formed in the tissue, or deposited in tissue when immune complex formation exceeds 
the body’s capacity to safely dispose of the complexes (see Section 1.28). Immune complexes 
may be deposited in any vascular bed but are most commonly deposited in organs with high 
blood flow such as the kidney and skin. 
Allergic reactions to heterologous serum such as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) are 
frequently due to Type III hypersensitivity. ATG is produced in rabbit or horse, and depletes

Drug-specific T cells infiltrate skin and damage keratinocytes 
T cells. It is a potent immunosuppressive agent. Some patients make antibodies against the 
foreign protein that they have received, despite concurrent potent immunosuppression. 
After 8-14 days of treatment or during a second course of ATG, these patients are at risk 
of developing serum sickness — an immune complex disease. Typical clinical features 
include a vasculitic skin rash, polyarticular arthritis and mild glomerulonephritis due 
to immune complex deposition in the skin, joints and glomeruli respectively. Patients 
are often systemically unwell with fatigue, myalgia and pyrexia, and an acute phase response 
reflects generalised inflammation. 
TYPE IV HYPERSENSITIVITY — DELAYED HYPERSENSITIVITY 
Type IV hypersensitivity results from activation of the cellular immune response. As it takes 
48-72 hours for naive T cells to be activated, proliferate and respond, this type of reaction 
is slow in onset — hence the term delayed type hypersensitivity. 
148 
OTHER TYPES OF HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS 
This type of sensitivity can occur in response to antibiotic or local anaesthetic containing 
creams. Many drugs are small molecules and act as haptens. Applied topically, drugs bind 
to keratinocytes leading to altered self. Hapten and carrier molecule are taken up by 
Langerhan’s cells, which then migrate to the draining lymph nodes. Antigen presenting cells 
(APCs) may then activate cognate T cells, which proliferate and mature, and subsequently 
home to the skin. Migration of T cells to the skin, which are reactive to allergen, results in 
inflammation while the hapten is present. 
This type of sensitivity is not detected by SPTs, which only detect IgE mediated allergies. 
However, patch testing may confirm the diagnosis. Patch testing involves applying sus- 
pected allergens to the skin under small chambers held in place by an adhesive strip. 
Inflammation detected at 48 hours or as late as 96 hours indicates sensitivity.

Immunodeficiency 
Exquisite predisposition to infections is a characteristic feature of immunodeficiency 
disorders. Autoimmune or malignant conditions also occur. A multitude of factors can 
predispose to an immunodeficient state. Immunodeficiency disorders should be considered 
in patients presenting with repeated, recurrent, severe or unusual infections. A suggestive 
or definite family history also warrants attention given that many primary immuno- 
deficiency conditions have a genetic basis. Organ damage secondary to infection (e.g. 
deafness, bronchiectasis) may indicate underlying immunodeficiency. 
CLASSIFICATION OF IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISORDERS 
Classification according to aetiology — primary or secondary 
150 
Primary immunodeficiency — intrinsic dysfunction of one or more components of the 
immune system. Some causes of primary immune dysfunction are: 
* 
Genetic 
— 
X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (Bruton’s) 
— 
Hyper-IgM syndrome (X-linked and autosomal recessive forms) 
— 
SCID subgroups (X-linked commonest) 
— 
Chronic granulomatous disease (X-linked; autosomal) 
— 
Complement deficiencies 
— 
Some IgG subclass deficiencies 
— 
Metabolic disorders (ADA and PNP deficiencies). 
* 
Maturational 
— 
Transient hypogammaglobulinaemia of infancy 
— 
Specific antibody deficiency. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
* 
Undefined/multifactorial 
— 
Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) 
— 
Specific antibody deficiencies. 
Many primary immunodeficiencies come to light in early childhood but others, including 
some recently recognised subtle defects, present at any time through to old age. They are 
life-long conditions unless successfully managed using curative therapies. Bone marrow 
transplantation and gene therapy are now a reality in primary immunodeficiency practice. 
Evidence-based therapies are available that improve outcome even if cure is not achieved 
in some of these disorders. Individual conditions are rare, but they remain nonetheless an 
important group of disorders to diagnose and treat effectively. Failure to do so results in 
significant morbidity and mortality. 
Secondary immunodeficiency — dysfunction of one or more immune components occurring 
as result of another process. 
Causes include: 
¢* 
Infections — most notably that associated with HIV, also occurs with measles, CMV 
and EBV infections. 
* 
Haematological malignancies — multiple myeloma; chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; 
lymphoma; treatment for these disorders. 
* 
Renal disease — nephrotic syndrome; uraemia. 
* 
Cancer therapies —- chemotherapy and radiotherapy; some immune therapies (mono- 
clonal antibodies). 
* 
Drugs 
- 
corticosteroids; 
other 
immunosuppressants; 
cytokine 
inhibitors; 
anticonvulsants; excessive alcohol intake. 
Poor nutritional status — primary malnutrition; cachexia secondary to other diseases. 
Surgery and trauma — major procedures; burns; multi-organ failure. 
Extremes of age — prematurity and very elderly. 
Protein-losing states — nephrotic syndrome; protein-losing enteropathy (reduction in 
immunoglobulin levels often dramatic, although clinical problems with infection are rare). 
¢*¢¢ 
¢ 
Many secondary immunodeficiencies involve defects in multiple immune pathways. Each 
defect may be subtle in isolation but in combination they predispose to very significant 
infection risk. Secondary immunodeficiency is a major problem worldwide. Globally, 
malnutrition and the HIV epidemic are major factors. Growing numbers of immuno- 
compromised patients arise secondary to ever-increasing use of intensive chemo- and 
radio-therapies 
in treatment 
of malignant diseases, immunosuppressive 
therapies 
in 
autoimmune and transplant settings and major surgical and other interventions. 
Classification according to immune defect 
An alternative approach is to classify immunodeficiency in terms of which limb of 
the immune system is predominantly deficient. The following categories are widely used: 
* 
Innate defect 
— 
Complement deficiency 
— 
Neutrophil deficiency. 
Specific defect (B cell/T cell) 
— 
Antibody (B cell) deficiency 
— T lymphocyte deficiency. 
151 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
One or more pathways may function inadequately. Specific clinical characteristics are 
associated with defective functioning of each of these pathways. The following are useful 
pointers in pin-pointing the type of defect in patients with suspected immunodeficiency. 
Sd 
Age at onset — major primary T cell defects become apparent soon after birth (days to 
weeks). If untreated death results within the first two years of life usually. Antibody 
defects typically occur after maternal antibody starts to decline (3-6 months). 
Type of infection — antibody-deficient patients typically are predisposed to pyogenic 
bacterial infection of the upper and lower respiratory tract. Complement deficiencies 
predispose especially to recurrent neisserial infections (meningococcal septicaemia and 
meningitis). Neutrophil disorders predispose to bacterial and fungal infections of the 
skin and deep-seated organs depending on the severity. T cell deficits predispose to all 
types of infection but especially opportunistic infections (e.g. atypical mycobacteria 
and other intracellular bacteria; disseminated viral infections; Pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia). 
Pattern of infection — what qualifies as ‘excessive’ depends on the age of the patient, 
the living environment and the past infection and immunisation history. Infants and 
toddlers in day-care facilities have a high incidence of mild viral infections (maybe as 
many as 15 in the first year). Development of an infection after appropriate immuni- 
sation is highly suspicious of impaired immunity. As a general guideline one major 
infection (e.g. pneumonia, septicaemia, meningitis, arthritis) and a number of minor 
infections or two major infections in a year is enough to warrant assessment of immune 
function. 
Associated features - many primary immunodeficiencies are associated with distinctive 
disorders in other systems (e.g. thrombocytopaenia, small platelet size and eczema in 
Wiskott—Aldrich syndrome; eczema in Omenn-type SCID; dwarfism; dysmorphic face, 
cleft lip and palate, hypocalcaemia and cardiac abnormalities in DiGeorge syndrome). 
Failure to thrive in infants and young children often accompanies significant immuno- 
compromise. Assessment for such features is an essential part of the assessment in 
patients with suspected immunodeficiency.

Defects in Antibody-mediated 
Immunity 
CLASSIFICATION 
Antibody-deficiency disorders (hypogammaglobulinaemia) may be classified as: 
¢ 
Primary hypogammaglobulinaemia 
—- 
resulting from an 
intrinsic disturbance of 
humoral (antibody-producing) immunity. 
¢ 
Secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia - where another disorder leads to antibody 
deficiency. 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
is the most common primary immunodeficiency, with an 
estimated prevalence of 1 per 25,000 of the population. Secondary defects are more 
common. 
Primary antibody deficiency disorders can present at any age. The most common form — 
CVID - is usually diagnosed after the age of 6 years and in some as late as 70 years. 
Regardless of the cause, even the most severe primary disorders of antibody production 
usually do not become apparent until about 3-6 months after birth, when protective 
maternal antibody becomes depleted. 
CLINICAL PRESENTATION 
Clinical presentation is varied, ranging from absence of symptoms through to major 
susceptibility 
to infections. 
Features 
of dysregulated immunity (autoimmunity and 
malignancy) occur less commonly. Patients are susceptible to repeated and sometimes 
severe 
infections particularly with encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, 
encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseriae spp). Susceptibility to other classes 
of microorganisms is not a major feature, with some exceptions. Giardia lamblia infection 
causing diarrhoea and malabsorption 
is well-described. Atypical bacterial infections 
in unusual sites — for example Mycoplasma arthritis and Ureaplasma UTIs also occur. 
Disseminated 
paralytic polio is described 
in a small number of antibody-deficient 
153 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
patients previously immunised with live polio vaccine. Chronic CNS enteroviral infection, 
causing a gradual decline in neurological function associated with myositis, is a rare but 
important condition in some severe antibody deficiencies. Opportunistic infections are 
rarely seen. 
Respiratory tract infections, both upper (middle ear, sinus, throat infections) and lower 
(bronchitis and pneumonia) occur in most patients. Skin infections (boils and abscesses), 
gut infections, central nervous system infections (meningitis), and joint infections also 
occur, Structural damage from repeated infections may result in bronchiectasis, deafness, 
chronic sinusitis and arthritis, particularly if diagnosis is delayed. Failure to thrive is 
common. 
Primary antibody deficiency disorders 
Disorders are broadly categorised as genetic or acquired. Genetic defects account for only 
10% of cases, but have provided important insights into B cell function. Genetic defects 
tend to be severe with early onset. The main defects are highlighted in Table 2.8.1. A 
number of other rare defects have recently been characterised. 
Secondary antibody deficiency disorders 
Conditions associated with secondary antibody deficiency are many (Table 2.8.2). Onset 
may be at any age, dependent on the type of underlying disease. Antibody deficiency may 
or may not be clinically evident. 
INVESTIGATION 
154 
A clinical immunologist should review all patients with known or suspected antibody 
deficiency. The following investigations are required: 
Total IgG, IgA and IgM compared with values in age-matched normal controls. 
Serum and urine electrophoresis to exclude underlying lymphoproliferative conditions. 
IgG subclasses, even if IgG levels normal. 
Specific antibody levels as a baseline and following immunisation if initial levels are 
low. 
¢ 
Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood measuring B and T cell numbers 
and subsets, and occasionally CD40 ligand expression. 
Functional 
analyses of 
lymphocytes im vitro are rarely required to make a diagnosis. 
¢ 
Specialist laboratories can identify specific protein deficiencies and genetic mutations 
in selected cases. The tests undertaken will be directed by the clinical and laboratory 
findings. 
¢ 
Assessment of active infection and/or damage in susceptible organs is important. 
Culture, polymerase chain 
reaction 
(PCR) 
testing, computer tomography 
(CT) 
scanning of chest and sinuses, endoscopic sinus examination and pulmonary function 
testing are undertaken in selected cases. 
¢ 
Full blood counts and baseline liver biochemistry should be performed. There are 
many different reasons why abnormalities may arise depending on the condition 
(e.g. cytopaenias in CVID, sclerosing cholangitis in hyper-IgM) and the treatment 
received (IVIg-related hepatitis).

TREATMENT AND MONITORING

4 
Immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy at regular intervals is the mainstay of therapy 
in patients with major antibody deficiencies (Section 4.8). Adequate immunoglobulin 
replacement before structural damage occurs dramatically improves patient well-being and 
prognosis. The role of immunoglobulin therapy in IgG subclass and specific antibody 
deficiencies is unclear. It is often used if antibiotic prophylaxis fails to control infection. 
Immunoglobulin supplementary therapy is useful in some patients with secondary 
immunodeficiencies, for example, patients with multiple myeloma and CLL with 
deficient specific antibody responses and a history of repeated infections. Treatment 
is generally not required in protein-losing states. 
Appropriate anti-microbial therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of infections is 
vital. 
Gene therapies are currently not available, but may play a role in genetic antibody- 
deficiencies in the future. 
DEFECTS IN ANTIBODY-MEDIATED IMMUNITY 
Case 2.8.1 Immunodeficiency 
A 20-year-old girl came to see her GP because of a chest infection that had failed to 
respond to two previous courses of antibiotics. She had a history of recurrent infec- 
tions, and in the last year had had antibiotics on six occasions prior to this chest 
infection. These had been prescribed for an ear infection, sinusitis, bacterial pharyn- 
gitis and three previous chest infections. She gave a history of a cough, productive of 
1-2 tablespoons of sputum each day, even when she did not have an infection. 
The GP was concerned about the pattern of frequent infections at different sites 
together with failure to respond to antibiotics. Chronic sputum production in a non- 
smoker raised the possibility of asthma 
or bronchiectasis. Measurement of 
immunoglobulins showed undetectable IgA (immunoglobulin A) and substantially 
reduced IgG at 3.0 g/l (Ref. Range 6.0-13.00 g/l). She was referred to the Immunology 
clinic. Further assessment showed normal number of lymphocytes including B cells. 
High resolution CT of the lungs showed bronchiectasis affecting the right lower lobe. 
Sputum culture grew Haemophilus influenzae. A diagnosis of bronchiectasis secondary 
to common variable immunodeficiency was made. 
The patient was treated with antibiotics and physiotherapy and replacement 
therapy with intravenous Ig was commenced. The patient’s general health improved 
considerably and she no longer produced sputum daily. However, she required 
antibiotics twice the following year for treatment of chest infections. Unfortunately 
as bronchiectasis was established prior to the introduction of Ig replacement, it is 
likely that she will continue to have episodes of chest infection.

Defects in T Cell-mediated 
Immunity 
Patients with T cell-mediated immune defects are susceptible to a broader range of 
infections and tend to be sicker than those with pure antibody deficiency. T cell immuno- 
deficiency may be: 
¢ 
Primary — intrinsic abnormality with diminished T cell numbers and/or function. 
¢ 
Secondary — extrinsic factor causes T cell dysfunction. For example, HIV infection; 
immunosuppressive therapies. 
Secondary defects are of varying severity and are dependent on the specific cause and the 
stage of involvement, for example, HIV is clinically quiescent for extended’ periods but 
eventually leads to profound T cell immunodeficiency. 
T cell-mediated immune defects are rarely isolated. B cell defects usually coexist if T cell 
function is impaired. 
CLASSIFICATION OF T CELL IMMUNODEFICIENCIES 
* 
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) — intrinsic defects cause absent or grossly 
deficient T cell immunity. SCID presents soon after birth and if untreated is promptly 
fatal. Many causes of SCID are now well characterised both clinically and at a 
molecular level. Genetic mutations with various patterns of T, B, and NK cell 
impairment are described. 
¢ 
Combined immunodeficiency disorders (CID) —- more moderate degrees of immuno- 
deficiency, occurring later and with slower progression than SCID. 
¢ 
Predominantly T cell defects —- rare conditions where B cell defects are limited. 
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
Prevalence 
SCID is rare, affecting an estimated 1 per 50,000 births. Less marked primary T cell 
deficiencies are increasingly recognised with more sensitive and wider availability of 
158 
DEFECTS IN T CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY 
investigations. HIV infection has a huge impact globally and is discussed in more detail in 
Section 2.13. 
Clinical presentation 
Defence against intracellular pathogens is dependent on functioning T cells. Associated 
B cell dysfunction predisposes to pyogenic infections. 
5 
Typical infections include: 
Viruses — disproportionately severe, prolonged or disseminated. Pathogens include 
RSV 
(pneumonia), 
parainfluenzae 
(respiratory), 
CMV 
(disseminated), 
EBV 
(disseminated), enteroviruses (GIT), rotavirus (GIT). 
Bacteria — pneumonia, ear infections, skin infections, septicaemia. 
Fungi — persistent candidiasis, often affecting the oesophagus, Aspergillus. 
Opportunistic 
— 
P. carinii pneumonia, opportunistic mycobacteriae (BCG-related 
infections). 
The following features are common: 
¢ 
Failure to thrive — infection-related. 
¢ 
Diarrhoea — secondary to chronic infections. 
¢ 
Skin rash 
— maternal lymphocytes transferred 
during pregnancy 
or by blood 
transfusion 
can 
cause 
Graft-versus-Host 
disease 
(GVHD), 
which 
causes 
an 
erythematous skin eruption as well as internal organ dysfunction. 
¢ 
Lymphadenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly — infections (EBV, CMV, BCG-osis); GVHD. 
@ 
Skeletal, cardiac, haematological and endocrine abnormalities 
— associated with 
distinct disorders (Table 2.9.1). 
¢ 
Family history —a 
positive family history or a history of consanguinity may be present. 
Diagnosis 
SCID is a paediatric emergency. Infants with suspicious clinical features should be 
investigated urgently. Prompt, appropriate management is essential for survival. Infants 
with SCID are usually lymphopaenic (check full blood count). Absolute lymphocyte counts 
are normally >2.8 x 107/l in neonates. Lymphocyte counts <2 < 107/I at birth are highly 
suspicious of an underlying SCID disorder. Urgent referral to a specialist centre for 
diagnosis and therapy is essential. 
Useful additional investigations are: 
Lymphocyte subpopulations — T, B and NK cell numbers. Subclassification into B+ 
and B— variants directs further investigation. More detailed phenotypic analysis, for 
example, CD4/CD8 T cell numbers, HLA expression, TCRB usage are useful in 
specific conditions. 
Immunoglobulins — total isotype and IgG subclass levels, specific antibodies directed against 
vaccine antigens (tetanus, Hib). Antibody deficiency is usual, regardless of B cell count. 
In vitro cell function assays — lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens and specific 
antigens are usually impaired. 
ADA measurement —- in T—B-SCID. 
HLA typing — if materno-fetal engraftment is suspected. Also required for BMT 
work-up. 
Genetic — study known genes of interest (IL-2R). Also useful in prenatal diagnosis 
where precise mutation is known. 
Microbial — expert microbiological involvement is critical.

Management 
An expert, multidisciplinary team is essential for good management. 
Key aspects of treatment include: 
* 
Infection management — prevention by isolation in a positive pressure area with 
reverse-barrier 
nursing and anti-microbial 
prophylaxis. 
Aggressive treatment 
of 
existing infections. 
* 
Immune reconstitution — bone marrow transplantation — ideally from a HLA-identical 
sibling. Matched unrelated and parental donors (haploid-identical) are also used. The 
outlook after BMT is excellent, especially for HLA-identical grafts transplanted before 
serious infection-related complications develop. 
¢ 
IVIg — required in most cases. 
* 
ADA enzyme replacement therapy may improve immune function in ADA-deficient 
patients. 
Case 2.9.1 Severe combined immunodeficiency 
A 3-month-old breastfed boy was admitted to hospital for rehydration with a 2-day 
history of severe diarrhoea. At the time he was noted to be below the third centile for 
length and weight. A candidal nappy rash was present. Initial blood tests showed 
haemoconcentration 
with a raised haemoglobin, sodium and urea. Following 
rehydration his condition improved, and biochemical indices returned to normal. 
Although the diarrhoea had not completely settled, his mother was keen to return 
home and he was discharged with instructions to return if the diarrhoea failed to 
settle. One month later, he represented with a severe chest infection. The diarrhoea, 
although improved had never completely settled. 
The possibility of immune deficiency was considered. The parents did not report 
any risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antibody tests on 
mother and baby were negative. Full blood count showed marked lymphopaenia of 
0.6 X 107/1. On review of the blood count taken on the previous admission this clue 
had been present previously, but the significance had not been considered. Lymphocyte 
subsets showed markedly reduced T cell count of 0.1 X 107/l, with B cells present in 
normal numbers. Functional testing showed a failure to proliferate in response to 
PHA. Immunoglobulins were not detectable. A diagnosis of T cell— B cell+ SCID 
(severe combined immunodeficiency) was made. Further investigation showed that 
the common y-chain of the IL-2 family of cytokine receptors was absent establishing 
the diagnosis of X-linked SCID. 
Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing was performed on the family members. 
The patient’s 8-year-old brother was found to be HLA identical. Bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) was performed using his HLA identical sibling. He experienced 
mild Graft-versus-Host Disease and a febrile episode while he was neutropenic. However, 
he made an excellent recovery, with full immune reconstitution.

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
¢ 
SCID 
is the first condition 
successfully treated by gene therapy in humans 
(Table 2.9.1). Patients with X-linked SCID have had the normal gene transferred into 
autologous stem cells and initial results are encouraging. ADA gene therapy has been 
less successful. Other forms of SCID may be treatable with gene therapy. 
¢ 
Nutritional support often with TPN is required. 
¢ 
All blood products must 
be irradiated 
(to prevent immunocompetent donor 
lymphocytes causing GVHD) and CMV-negative (to prevent CMV infection). 
* 
No live vaccines (BCG, MMR, oral polio) should be given, as serious infection may result. 
COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCIES 
Cell-mediated immunodeficiencies less severe than SCID are described. These conditions are 
not trivial. Some progress to late onset SCID. Lymphoreticular malignancies and serious 
non-immunological abnormalities may occur. Treatment depends on the severity of the 
underlying immunodeficiency (Table 2.9.2) BMT may be required. Immune support (e.g. 
antibody replacement therapy) may be adequate. As in SCID, untreated blood transfusions 
and live vaccines should be avoided.

DEFECTS IN T CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY 
Some disorders are characterised by predominant T cell defects with relative preservation 
of antibody-mediated immunity. Two important conditions in this category are: 
DiGeorge syndrome 
This results from abnormal development of the pharyngeal 
pouches resulting in thymic hypoplasia and immunodeficiency, and abnormalities of facial, 
parathyroid gland and cardiac development. The genetic basis in most cases is a microdele- 
tion on chromosome 22q11. Total DiGeorge syndrome is extremely rare and resembles 
SCID, however, a partial syndrome associated with chromosome 22q11 deletion is com- 
mon (1/5000 population). Only 25% of those with the deletion have abnormal immuno- 
logical investigations and 2-3% have clinical immunodeficiency. The syndrome is also 
called CATCH-22 (cardiac anomalies, abnormal face, thymic aplasia, cleft palate, hypo- 
calcaemia with abnormalities on chromosome 22). Cell- and antibody-mediated immunity 
may be abnormal, and autoimmune cytopaenias are common. Management is dictated by 
severity of immunodeficiency. Severe cases are managed like other SCIDs. Lesser degrees of 
immunodeficiency are conservatively managed. Measures to avoid GvHD (irradiated 
blood) and iatrogenic infection (CMV negative blood, avoidance of live vaccines) may be 
required. Immune function may improve or deteriorate with age. 
Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis 
This is a condition of variable inheritance that 
results 
in defective protection against candida. 
Skin and mucous membranes 
are 
predominantly affected and deep-seated infection is rare. An associated endocrinopathy 
(parathyroid, adrenals, thyroid, ovarian) 
is seen in some. Gut autoimmunity 
is also 
recognised. Small numbers have a more generalised cell-mediated immunodeficiency with 
predisposition to other intracellular infections, akin to SCID. Anti-fungal prophylaxis 
and monitoring for evolving endocrine diseases are required.

Neutrophil Disorders 
Neutrophil disorders include abnormalities of: 
¢ 
Neutrophil number (common, usually acquired) 
¢ 
Neutrophil function (rare). 
CLINICAL PRESENTATION 
Typical clinical features include: 
Skin and mucus membrane infections 
Oral ulceration, poor dentition, infective gum disease 
Abscesses 
Deep-seated infections in severely affected individuals. 
¢¢¢ 
¢ 
Common pathogens include Staphylococci, other catalase-positive bacteria and fungi. 
Infections can be recurrent or prolonged and responses to anti-microbial therapies may be 
impaired. 
- 
CLASSIFICATION OF NEUTROPHIL DISORDERS 
164 
Neutropaenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count <2 X 10°/l. Mild neutropaenia is 
usually asymptomatic. Infection rates are increased with counts <1 X 10°/. Neutropaenia 
of <0.5 X 107/ is associated with potentially life-threatening infection. Causes are many. 
Neutropaenic disorders are broadly categorised into: 
¢ 
Disorders of production (with bone marrow hypoplasia) — may be primary, where an 
intrinsic bone marrow disorder results in reduced neutrophil production. Congenital 
neutropaenic disorders are often severe and present early in life (e.g. Kostmann’s 
syndrome), and are usually managed at expert haematology centres. In cyclical 
NEUTROPHIL DISORDERS 
neutropaenia neutrophil counts fall at 3-weekly regular intervals with subsequent 
infection, usually affecting the mouth. 
The most common neutrophil-related disorder is secondary neutropaenia resulting from 
many therapies and disorders, including leukaemias and other myelodysplastic conditions, 
aplastic anaemia, cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy regimes, and immunosuppressants), 
radiotherapy, other drug reactions (e.g. carbimazole), and infections. 
¢ 
Disorders of neutrophil destruction 
— neutropaenia 
also results from excessive 
destruction of neutrophils despite normal or high bone marrow output. Splenomegaly 
of any cause can be associated with neutropaenia (e.g. Felty’s syndrome in rheumatoid 
arthritis). Immune 
neutropaenia 
results from enhanced 
cell destruction 
due to 
neutrophil-specific antibodies. 
NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION DISORDERS 
Several rare disorders, many with known genetic defects, cause symptomatic neutrophil 
dysfunction. Altered function precipitated by infections, malnutrition, other illnesses 
(e.g. sickle-cell disease, uraemia, diabetes mellitus), or therapies (steroids, chemotherapy) 
also occurs but is rarely clinically important. Functional disorders are broadly classified 
according to the dominant dysfunction. 
Neutrophil movement (chemotaxis) 
Adhesion 
Phagocytosis (microbial uptake) 
Respiratory burst and killing. 
¢$¢¢ 
¢ 
Chronic granulomatous disease (X-linked and autosomal recessive) results from mutations 
in genes encoding cytochrome b/NADPH oxidase enzymes causing reduced cytotoxic oxygen 
radical production and impaired bacterial killing. Patients develop infections caused by cata- 
lase-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Serratia and Nocardia) and 
fungi (Aspergillus). Skin and deep-seated abscess formation occurs. Patients develop non- 
caseating granulomata in different parts of the body, typically including lymph nodes, liver, 
spleen and gut-associated lymphoid tissues. This may represent an inappropriate response to 
unresolved infections. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract granulomata may cause obstructive 
complications. Many cases are clinically apparent from childhood but less severe phenotypes may 
present in adulthood. Early recognition and appropriate therapy greatly improves outcome. 
Leucocyte adhesion 
deficiency (LAD) 
- 
adhesion molecules 
facilitate neutrophil 
movement across blood vessel walls towards sites of infection. Several genetic mutations in 
these adhesion molecules result in LAD, resulting in bacterial infections and abscesses. 
Severe forms are apparent from infancy but milder phenotypes present later. Gum disease, 
tooth loss, delayed separation of the umbilical cord (normally occurs within the first week 
of life), poor formation of pus at sites of infection, and disproportionate rises in the white 
cell count during infection (cells cannot pass into tissues) are characteristic. 
Hyper-IgE syndrome is a disorder of uncertain aetiology. Neutrophil chemotaxis is 
impaired. Patients present with recurrent infections and develop staphylococcal abscesses. 
Atypical eczema, a characteristic coarse facial appearance (lion-like), osteopaenia with 
pathological fractures of the central skeleton, and abnormal dentition (failure to lose first 
teeth, eruption of the second teeth and dental overcrowding) are also seen. Total IgE levels 
are hugely elevated. An underlying defect of lymphocyte regulation rather than an intrinsic 
neutrophil disorder may be responsible. 
165 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Many other conditions are associated with neutrophil dysfunction. These include 
Chediak—Higashi syndrome, Griscelli syndrome, and specific enzyme deficiencies such as 
Glucose-6-Phosphate dehydrogenase, myeloperoxidase and lactoferrin 
deficiencies. 
Variable levels of clinical immunodeficiency together with non-immunological abnormali- 
ties (e.g. albinism in the case of Chediak—Higashi and Griscelli syndromes) occur. 
CLINICAL INVESTIGATION 
The following is an outline of investigation for patients with suspected neutrophil abnor- 
malities. The tests are discussed in detail in Section 3.11. 
¢ 
Absolute neutrophil count. If low, this is the likely cause of neutrophil abnormality. 
* 
Blood film to assess neutrophil morphology 
Patients with typical histories and normal or high numbers of morphologically normal neu- 
trophils should be referred to an immunologist for investigation. Tests of all the compo- 
nents of neutrophil function are available. All require a fresh unclotted whole blood 
sample. 
* 
‘Total IgE, Ig levels and T and B cell profiles may be useful to exclude alternative 
immunodeficiencies. 
* 
Microbial analysis with special fungal cultures should be undertaken if active infection 
is suspected. 
¢ 
Respiratory burst capacity is measured when chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is 
suspected. For details see Section 3.11. 
¢ 
Adhesion marker profile should be assessed in patients with suspected leucocyte adhe- 
sion deficiency (LAD). 
TREATMENT 
166 
Appropriate antimicrobial therapy (for active infections and prophylaxis) is the mainstay of 
management. G-CSF is useful in symptomatic, severely neutropaenic patients. Prophylactic 
therapy with cotrimoxazole and anti-fungal therapy improves outlook for patients with 
CGD. IFN-y therapy is used widely in the United States, but less so in Europe for disease 
suppression. Bone marrow transplantation is curative in CGD, however, risks are high in the 
absence of a HLA-identical donor. Patient selection is difficult as CGD may run a benign 
course and factors predictive of a poor outcome are unknown. BMT is also an option in 
some other severe neutrophil disorders (LAD). Genetic manipulation may be an option in 
the future.

Complement Deficiency 
Genetic deficiencies of all components of the complement cascade and many complement 
regulatory molecules are well recognised. Secondary deficiencies, caused by increased 
consumption in conditions such as active systemic lupus erthematosus (SLE) and some 
forms of glomerulonephritis, are more common. 
Most genetic complement deficiencies 
are autosomal recessive 
in inheritance. The 
exceptions are properdin deficiency (X-linked) and C1 inhibitor deficiency (autosomal 
dominant). Inherited complement deficiency disorders are rare with C1 inhibitor deficiency 
being the most common. 
C1 inhibitor deficiency causes angioedema rather than 
immunodeficiency or immune complex disease (see Section 2.3). C2 deficiency is the most 
prevalent (1/10,000) conventional complement disorder in Caucasians. Mannan binding 
lectin (MBL) deficiency, caused by polymorphisms in the MBL gene is increasingly recog- 
nised. MBL is involved in activation of the complement cascade. The clinical significance of 
MBL deficiency is not fully clarified but it may be relevant when microbe-specific antibodies 
are defective. Partial complement deficiencies resulting from heterozygous carriage of 
mutated genes are usually clinically silent, although certain partial deficiencies (C2, C4 and 
C3) are associated with an increased frequency of specific autoimmune conditions. 
CLINICAL PRESENTATION 
Clinical features associated with complement deficiency include: 
¢ 
Recurrent pyogenic infections 
¢ 
Exquisite susceptibility to Neisserial infections (meningococcal infections) 
¢ 
Immune-complex mediated disorders, especially SLE. 
The precise features depend on whether the deficient component is involved in the classical 
(C1—C4—C2-C3), lectin (MBL—C4—C2-C3) or alternative (Factor B, Factor D, Properdin, C3, 
and Factors H and I) activation pathways, or in the common terminal pathway (C5—C9). 
Deficiency of any component that impairs conversion of C3 to its active state increases 
predisposition to pyogenic infections. This occurs particularly with C3 deficiency, and with 
167 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
deficiencies of activating pathway components, control protein deficiencies (Factor H and 
Factor I), as well as in secondary C3 depletion (e.g. nephritic factor-related glomeru- 
lonephritis). Complement is particularly important in the early stages of infection and 
where there are low microbe-specific antibody levels. 
Defective function of the classical activation pathway impairs clearance of immune 
complexes, increasing susceptibility to immune complex-mediated diseases, particularly 
SLE. Heterozygous carriers of mutated C4 and C2 genes are also at risk. Partial deficien- 
cies of C4 are reasonably common in SLE patients, but the absolute risk of developing SLE 
is much greater in patients with complete C1 and C2 deficiencies. 
However, on a population level, C1 and C2 deficiencies are much less prevalent than 
partial C4 deficiencies. Early age of onset, severe disease with critical organ involvement 
(renal manifestations), together with a positive family history are especially characteristic 
of Cl deficiencies (deficiencies of all three subunits have been described). Autoimmune 
serology (ANA, anti-dsDNA) may be unexpectedly negative. Unusual forms of skin involve- 
ment are also described in C2-deficient SLE. 
Patients with genetic deficiencies of the terminal pathway components (C5—C8 especially, 
less so C9) and also Properdin are exquisitely predisposed to infections with Neisserial species 
(meningococcus and gonococcus). Patients with a history of recurring Neisserial infection, 
infection caused by unusual serotypes, and infection in adulthood warrant investigation. 
INVESTIGATION 
CHS0O measurement - functional assessment of complement lytic capacity. Both classical 
and alternative pathway assays should be performed. The pattern of impairment of 
classical and alternative pathways indicates the part of the complement cascade involved. 
Measurement of specific complement components 
based on these findings can 
be 
performed at specialist laboratories. Further details are outlined in Section 3.10. 
TREATMENT 
No specific treatments are available. Meningococcal immunisation should be offered to all 
at risk. Antibiotic prophylaxis may also be useful. Patients should be aware of indicators 
of infection and the need for prompt medical care. Plasma infusions for patients with active 
infection have been suggested but no trials are available and some reports indicate poten- 
tial adverse effects. SLE associated with genetic complement deficiencies and conditions 
that precipitate complement deficiency through excessive consumption are managed along 
usual therapeutic guidelines.

Defective Splenic Function 
The spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ, which also filters blood, removing bacteria and 
parasitised red blood cells (RBCs). Opsonisation increases the efficiency of particle removal. 
The spleen plays a particularly important role in antibody responses against polysaccharides. 
CAUSES OF DEFECTIVE SPLENIC FUNCTION 
The most common cause of reduced or absent splenic function are: 
* 
Congenital absence of the spleen (asplenia) 
* 
Surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy), because of 
— 
Trauma 
— 
Autoimmune cytopaenias 
— 
Lymphoproliferative disorders. 
¢ 
Functional hyposplenism 
— 
Coeliac disease 
— 
Sickle-cell anaemia. 
Reimplantation of a portion of splenic tissue during splenectomy reduces the risk of 
hyposplenism. 
_ DIAGNOSIS OF HYPOSPLENISM 
The spleen normally removes abnormal and aged RBCs from the circulation, including 
RBCs released prematurely from bone marrow containing remnants of DNA (Howell-Jolly 
bodies) and denatured haemoglobin (Heinz bodies). Howell-Jolly and Heinz bodies are 
rarely seen in normal peripheral blood, but are seen in a significant percentage of RBCs in 
subjects with hyposplenism. Thrombocytosis and monocytosis are often present. 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Radionucleotide 
scans measuring removal of isotope labelled particles from the 
bloodstream allow localisation of splenic remnants, but are rarely required to assess splenic 
function. 
CLINICAL FEATURES OF HYPOSPLENISM 
Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) is a major long-term risk following 
splenectomy, or in patients with splenic dysfunction. OPSI is a fulminant infection, often 
due to encapsulated bacteria, with a mortality of up to 50%. The risk of OPSI is highest in 
the two years post-splenectomy, but remains clinically significant lifelong. The risk is 
relatively reduced when splenectomy follows trauma, but is greatly increased when splenec- 
tomy is performed in patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, in children under the 
age of 5, and when hyposplenism is secondary to sickle-cell anaemia (SCA). 
Most serious post-splenectomy infections are caused by S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus), H. 
influenzae type B (HiB), and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus). Salmonella infection 
is a particular problem in patients with hyposplenism due to SCA. Infection with 
Escherichia coli, as well as malaria, babesiosis (a tick-borne parasite) and Capnocytophaga 
canimorsus (transmitted by dog and other animal bites) are also important risks. 
MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH HYPOSPLENISM 
Management is aimed at reducing the risk of OPSI, and ensuring prompt and adequate 
therapy when infection occurs despite prophylaxis. Patients must also be educated about 
the other less common health risks of hyposplenism. 
Patient education 
The risk of OPSI must be clearly communicated, and the need to continue prophylactic antibi- 
otics discussed. Patients should understand the risk of encouraging microbial resistance by 
intermittent use of antibiotics, the need to seek medical attention and start immediate ther- 
apeutic antibiotics for any febrile illness, as well as following animal bites. Travel advice 
should include explanation of the increased risk of malaria and babesiosis and strong 
advice to avoid areas where resistant malaria and/or Plasmodium falciparum are endemic. 
Prophylactic antibiotics 
Lifelong use 
of prophylactic 
antibiotics 
is recommended, 
with oral penicillin 
or 
erythromycin (if penicillin-allergic). Antibiotic prophylaxis is particularly important in chil- 
dren, in the first two years post-splenectomy and in those with additional defects of 
immune function. All patients should have a course of therapeutic antibiotics to take at the 
onset of a febrile, potentially infective illness. Antibiotics should be given prophylactically 
in the event of an animal bite. 
Immunisation 
The risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria is substantially reduced by vaccination, 
preferably two weeks before elective splenectomy. Where this is not possible, vaccination 
should be given prior to discharge. Hyposplenic patients not previously vaccinated should 
be vaccinated at the first opportunity. Vaccinations recommended include polyvalent pneu- 
mococcal vaccine (revaccinate every five years), HiB, meningitis C conjugate vaccine as well 
170 
DEFECTIVE SPLENIC FUNCTION 
as annual influenza vaccine. Annual measurement of anti-pneumococcal antibody levels is 
recommended, and early revaccination may be advisable where protective antibody levels 
are not maintained. 
Communication of risk 
All healthcare providers must be aware of a patient’s hyposplenism and patients should 
carry a splenectomy card or wear a medic-Alert bracelet. 
Adequate therapy of infections 
As with all immunodeficiencies prompt instigation of adequate therapy for potential 
infections is essential. Recommendations for febrile illness vary with prophylaxis, local 
patterns of penicillin resistance and penicillin allergy. However, penicillin, erythromycin or 
cefotaxime are commonly used. Microbiology advice should be sought immediately, 
however, this should not delay treatment.

Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus 
_ EPIDEMIOLOGY 
AIDS was first described in the early 1980s and soon after attributed to infection with HIV. 
Globally, AIDS is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in Africa where 
95% of all HIV-related deaths occur and prevalence rates are as high as 20-45%. HIV is 
present in body fluids — blood, semen, breast milk and saliva. Modes of virus transmission 
include: 
Sexual 
¢ 
Homosexual transmission was originally identified. 
¢ 
Heterosexual transmission is increasingly important globally and is the dominant route 
of infection in Africa. Failure to observe safe sexual practices is a growing problem in 
all groups. 
. 
Parenteral 
¢ 
HIV infection among haemophiliacs receiving blood-derived Factor VIII concentrates 
demonstrated HIV transmission by blood products. Screening and testing of all blood 
and organ donors has virtually eliminated HIV transmission by these routes. 
However, infected donors in the early phases of infection will not be identified. Blood 
quarantine limits this risk, but is not possible for all blood products. 
¢ 
Intravenous drug users are infected by sharing of blood-contaminated needles. 
* 
Occupational exposure to infected blood and contaminated sharps can result in 
infection, if correct infection control procedures are not observed. 
Vertical 
Transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery and via breast milk is the 
major route of HIV infection in children.

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 
HIV BIOLOGY 
HIV, binds to and is internalized by CD4+ T cells via a surface-expressed glycoprotein 
molecule — gp-120. Co-binding to the chemokine receptor CCRS is also required for 
uptake. Some genetic mutations in CCRS render cells resistant to HIV infection. 
The major HIV targets are: 
CD4+ T cells 
Dendritic cells 
Monocytes/Macrophages 
Follicular dendritic cells 
CNS; gut tissue. 
¢$¢¢ 
O@ 
¢ 
HIV is an RNA retrovirus. It undergoes reverse transcription to DNA and subsequent 
integration into the cell genome. HIV is highly damaging to the immune system. This 
results from: 
Depletion of CD4+ T cells — the major effect 
Impaired T memory responses 
Defective cytotoxicity 
Defective antibody responses. 
¢¢¢ 
¢ 
Surviving infected cells in lymphoid tissue, CNS and the gut act as viral reservoirs where 
viral replication continues at varying rates, depending on the stage of the disease. HIV is 
highly susceptible to mutation and this limits the effectiveness of the host response to the 
virus and facilitates the emergence of therapy-resistant strains (Figure 2.13.1).

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND STAGING 
Presentation is variable. Opportunistic, disproportionately severe or recurrent infections, 
and specific forms of malignancy, 
all related 
to immunodeficiency, predominate. 
Lymphadenopathy, gut dysfunction and distinct neurological disturbances related to HIV 
infection of these tissues also occurs. The features at presentation are closely related to the 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cell count. 
A number of well-characterised stages of disease are recognised. They are: 
Primary infection 
Frequently symptomatic approximately 2-4 weeks post-infection. 
Usually vague ‘flu-like’ symptoms. Neurological inflammation occurs rarely. CD4+ T cell 
numbers fall, sometimes dramatically, while HIV-specific cytotoxic T cells increase, causing 
a reversal of the normal CD4:CD8 ratio. HIV replication is active and detectable (‘viral 
load’). HIV antibodies, however, are not detectable for up to 3 months post-infection. 
Symptom severity, HIV viral load and CD4+ T cell count at the end of this period correlate 
with the rate of progression to more advanced stages. 
Asymptomatic disease 
May persist for many years. Viral replication in lymphoid 
tissues persists and CD4 T cell numbers gradually decline. 
Mildly symptomatic 
disease 
Lymphadenopathy, 
weight loss, fever, diarrhoea, 
mucocutaneous candidiasis but not AIDS-defining illnesses are seen. 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
This is defined by the development of one ot 
a number of specified infections or malignancies, or 
a CD4 count below 200/mm°. 
Important AIDS-defining illnesses and the approximate CD4+ T cell number at which 
they pose a threat include: 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) <200/mm° 
Pulmonary TB — 200-500/mm? 
Cerebral toxoplasmosis — <100/mm? 
CNS lymphoma — 100/mm? 
Disseminated CMV infection — <50/mm/?. 
¢¢¢ 
¢ 
4 
Outlook depends on the presentation. PCP-related mortality is high if specific therapy is 
delayed. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is highly responsive to appropriate anti-microbial therapy. 
CNS lymphoma has a grave prognosis. 
INVESTIGATIONS 
174 
Confirmation of infection relies on demonstration of HIV antibodies in peripheral blood 
[enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)/immunoblot]. Detection of HIV antigen or 
RNA is useful in early infection, and in neonates. HIV testing should not be undertaken 
without appropriate counselling and informed written consent. 
Surrogate markers of infection, for example, CD4 count/CD4:CD8 ratio should never 
be relied upon because these parameters can be normal in HIV infection and are abnormal 
in many other conditions. 
Sequential monitoring of CD4 T cell counts and viral load is central to the management 
of patients with HIV infection. Both parameters guide therapeutic decisions about: 
* 
Specific anti-HIV therapies 
¢ 
Infection prophylactic therapies 
¢ 
Effectiveness of anti-HIV drugs. 
HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 
Patients with HIV should also be screened and monitored for other blood-borne infections 
(hepatitis viruses, CMV), sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (syphilis, other STDs), and 
other common immunodeficiency-related infections (cryptococcus, toxoplasmosis). Chest 
X-ray for TB, cervical screening in women and proctoscopy in men are also recommended. 
TREATMENT 
HIV infection is not curable. Avoidance of infection is essential. Education programmes 
suitable for all at-risk populations (almost everyone) in all settings (developed and 
developing countries) cannot be over-emphasised. 
Outlook in HIV-positive patients has improved dramatically by the availability of 
anti-retroviral agents that block viral replication. The main drug categories are: 
* 
Reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
* 
Protease inhibitors. 
Several drug combinations providing highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are 
widely published, and are prescribed and monitored by specialists. Benefit is proven in 
advanced disease and in prevention of vertical transmission. There may be benefit in 
seroconverters, patients with a high viral load or rapidly falling CD4 count, and post- 
exposure prophylaxis. HAART is associated with improved immune function (reconstitu- 
tion) and rising CD4+ T cell counts in responsive patients. Adverse side-effects (rashes, GI 
upsets, neuropathies, metabolic upsets) occur not infrequently and can require drug 
discontinuation. Other patients fail to respond or become resistant. 
Chemoprophylaxis 
— administration of antimicrobial therapies to prevent specific 
infections is effective against some of the microbes. Cotrimoxazole to prevent PCP (CD4 
count <200/mm*) is the best-known example. HAART may allow discontinuation of 
chemoprophylactic regimes. HAART is extremely expensive and not available in most 
developing countries, limiting available therapy to chemoprophylaxis. In addition, good 
nutritional and psychological supports are important aspects of care for HIV-infected 
patients.

Autoimmunity 
Autoimmunity results from defective self-tolerance. Autoimmune 
reactivity describes 
detectable autoantibodies or autoreactive T cells, but disease is not necessarily present. 
Autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system targets self tissues or organs result- 
ing in dysfunction. Autoimmune disease may involve a single organ (organ specific autoim- 
mune disease), or may result in multisystem disease (non-organ-specific autoimmune 
disease). Twin studies indicate an important genetic component in the pathogenesis of 
autoimmunity; however, autoimmune diseases also have significant environmental influ- 
ences. The genetic diathesis in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity means that a personal or 
family history of one autoimmune disease increases the risk of other autoimmune disorders. 
Autoimmune disease is more common in premenopausal women, suggesting hormonal 
influences. In some conditions women may experience catamenial exacerbation of symp- 
toms (symptoms vary with the menstrual cycle). Several types of organ specific autoim- 
mune disease are discussed in Sections 2.15—2.21 and common non- organ, specific disorders 
are described in Sections 2.22-2.24. 
INDUCTION OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE 
- 
Mechanisms of induction of autoimmunity have been outlined in Section 1.28, and are 
summarised in Table 2.14.1. Refer to individual sections for further detail. 
Kawasaki syndrome 
is a vasculitis, usually seen 
in children, characterised by 
inflammation of medium-sized vessels with a predilection for coronary arteries. Patients 
develop prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, mucositis, cervical lymphadenopathy, rash and 
desquamation of the hands and feet. The disease often follows Staphylococcal or 
Streptococcal infections, leading to the hypothesis that immune activation by bacterial 
superantigens plays a pathogenic role. Aneurysm formation particularly in coronary vessels 
is a serious complication. Early treatment with high dose IVIg and aspirin reduces the risk 
of aneurysm formation.

Autoimmune disease may result from Types II, III or IV hypersensitivity, or combinations of 
these mechanisms. Autoantibodies are produced in many autoimmune diseases, but their 
presence does not imply a pathogenic role (Figure 2.14.1). Establishing that an antibody is 
pathogenic requires demonstration of:

The presence of antibody in the diseased organ 
¢ 
Disease transfer across the placenta or to animals following antibody infusion

Correlation of antibody level with disease activity 
* 
Biological plausibility. 
Autoantibodies play a pathogenic role in conditions including autoimmune haemolytic 
anaemia, anti-GBM disease, myasthenia gravis and some autoimmune blistering skin dis- 
eases. Autoantibodies may contribute to tissue injury in several other conditions. However, 
even as epiphenomena, autoantibodies frequently provide valuable diagnostic tests. 
Most autoimmune diseases result in inflammation, and in non-organ specific auto- 
immune disease, an acute phase response is detectable (increased ESR or CRP, and polyclonal 
hypergammaglobulinaemia). Immune complex deposition diseases (Type III hypersensitivity 
disorders) are characterised by immune complex deposition and complement activation, 
resulting in complement consumption. Serial measurement of complement levels are of 
value. Complement components are also acute phase reactants and the effects of inflamma- 
tion (raising levels) may mask the effects of consumption (reduced levels). Hence results 
must be interpreted with caution. Measurement of organ dysfunction is essential in diagno- 
sis, assessment of extent of non-organ specific autoimmune disease, as well as monitoring 
disease activity and response to therapy.

Autoimmune 
Endocrinopathies 
Organ specific autoimmune disease can affect any endocrine gland, however, the thyroid is 
most commonly affected. Patients with autoimmune endocrine disease also have an 
increased prevalence of other organ specific and non-organ specific autoimmune disorders, 
reflecting an underlying predisposition to autoimmunity. There are well-described poly- 
glandular syndromes where several autoimmune endocrinopathies occur, with or without 
non-endocrine features. Some of these are heritable and a genetic defect in an immunoreg- 
ulatory molecule (Autoimmune regulator, AIRE) is known to be the basis of autoimmune 
polyendocrinopathy syndrome Type I. Treatment of autoimmune endocrinopathies is by 
replacement of hormone deficiency resulting from gland destruction. Immunosuppression 
is not routinely used. 
AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE 
Autoimmune thyroid disease can cause: 
¢ 
 Goitre (enlargement of the thyroid gland) 
¢ 
Hypothyroidism (thyroxine deficiency) 
¢ 
Hyperthyroidism (excessive production of thyroxine). 
Thyroid autoreactivity also occurs in patients who have thyroiditis, and thyroid cancer. 
Hashimoto's thyroiditis 
This is a lymphocytic thyroiditis of unknown cause, initially causing hyperthyroidism 
(often subclinical), followed by hypothyroidism when thyroid destruction has occurred. 
Older women are frequently affected, and goitre is common. Associated autoimmune 
disease is common. 
Gland destruction is due to cellular mechanisms, however, 90% of patients have 
high-titre antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO), providing a useful diagnostic test. 
179 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Antibodies to thyroglobulin are only found in the absence of anti-thyroid peroxidase in 
about 1% of patients. 
Graves’ disease 
Graves’ 
disease 
usually presents 
with hyperthyroidism 
and goitre. Females 
are 
predominantly affected. The majority of patients have anti-[PO antibodies, which are 
useful indicators of the autoimmune process, but are not pathogenic. Graves’ disease has 
a clear genetic predisposition, with concordance in identical twins of 30%. 
Stimulating antibodies to the TSH receptor and growth promoting antibodies, which 
bind the insulin-like growth factor receptor, play a pathogenic role. Transplacental transfer 
of stimulating antibodies may cause neonatal hyperthyroidism. 
Graves’ 
disease may be associated 
with exophthalmos, 
due to inflammation 
in 
retro-orbital fat and connective tissue. Different autoantibodies to unidentified antigens in 
connective tissue are implicated. Thyroid acropachy may also be seen. 
Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, thyroid function tests and imaging, and anti- 
thyroid antibodies. Remission can be induced using anti-thyroid drugs. If relapse occurs, 
definitive 
treatment with surgery 
or radiolabelled 
iodine 
is undertaken. Immuno- 
suppression is not used for the thyroid disease, but may be necessary in severe eye disease, 
if this becomes sight-threatening. 
Thyroiditis and other thyroid disease 
Thyroiditis may be due to infection of the thyroid or unidentified causes. The resulting 
granulomatous inflammation causes 
a painful goitre and abnormal thyroid function. 
Patients often have weakly positive anti-thyroid antibodies. 
Thyroiditis can occur in pregnancy, usually causing hyperthyroidism, followed by 
hypothyroidism before finally resolving. Thyroiditis may be associated with post-natal 
depression. Anti-thyroid antibodies found during pregnancy 
are predictive of hypo- 
thyroidism during or after the pregnancy. 
Thyroid antibodies are found in non-immune thyroid disease, including thyroid cancer, 
probably produced secondary to thyroid damage. The presence of anti-thyroid antibodies 
in patients with thyroid nodules is not an indication of autoimmune disease. 
INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS 
180 
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or Type I DM results from autoimmune 
destruction of the islets of Langerhans, leading to insulin deficiency. Genetic predisposition 
is significant with 50% concordance in identical twins. Unusually, males and females are at 
equal risk. Several HLA-types contribute to genetic susceptibility, while possession of DR2 
appears to be protective. Environmental factors implicated in genetically susceptible indi- 
viduals include viral infections. 
Destruction of the islets is primarily mediated by cytotoxic T cells, however, autoanti- 
bodies to islets, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and insulin are detectable before, and 
1-2 years following onset of disease. Interestingly there is sequence homology between 
GAD-67 (the pancreatic isozyme) and coxsackie viruses, one of the infections epidemio- 
logically linked to IDDM. 
IDDM is diagnosed by demonstrating elevated glucose. Autoantibodies are not useful at 
diagnosis or in establishing prognosis. However, in patients with other autoimmune dis- 
ease, anti-islet antibodies indicate current or future risk of developing IDDM. IDDM is 
associated with coeliac disease, and anti-endomysial antibodies should be measured, even 
in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. 
AUTOIMMUNE ENDOCRINOPATHIES 
Aggressive immunosuppression at the onset of disease or in antibody-positive siblings 
can delay the need for insulin therapy. However, the toxicity and risks of therapy greatly 
exceed the benefits. In the future, tolerogenic therapies for people at high risk of IDDM 
may become a reality. 
ADDISON'S DISEASE 
In the developed world, the commonest cause of adrenal destruction 
is autoimmune 
adrenalitis, however, on a worldwide basis tuberculosis remains the most common cause. 
Other infections, malignancy, sarcoidosis and haemorrhage also cause hypoadrenalism. 
Destruction of the adrenal is due to cellular responses, however, autoantibodies are 
produced in about 80% of patients and are 
useful in confirming the diagnosis. 
Occasionally anti-adrenal antibodies can be detected in patients with hypoadrenalism 
for other causes, including up to 5% of patients with malignancy. There is a clinical 
association with ovarian failure and anti-ovarian antibodies should also be requested. 
OVARIAN AUTOIMMUNITY 
Premature ovarian failure occurs in 1% of women. This is associated with autoimmune 
polyglandular syndrome in 20% of cases. Antibodies to ovarian tissue and often adrenal 
gland are detectable. Autoimmune ovarian failure can occur in the absence of other 
autoimmune endocrine 
disease, however, there is a future risk of other autoimmune 
endocrinopathies.

Autoimmunity 
can

in isolation 
or as 
components of a systemic autoimmune disorder. 
IMMUNE-MEDIATED THROMBOCYTOPAENIA 
Immune-mediated thrombocytopaenia 
(ITP) may be alloimmune 
or autoimmune. 
Alloimmune thrombocytopaenia is rare and affects babies of women sensitised to platelet 
antigens by transfusion or previous pregnancy. Maternal antibody to platelet antigens not 
expressed by the mother crosses the placenta and damages fetal platelets. ITP is much more 
common, resulting from autoantibodies against platelets. 
ITP may be: 
An isolated abnormality 
In association with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (Evans syndrome) 
Part of systemic autoimmune disorders such as SLE 
Due to immune dysregulation complicating immunodeficiency (e.g. CVID) 
Associated with lymphoid malignancy (e.g. CLL) 
Associated with infections (e.g. HIV). 
e¢¢

o 
ITP is characterised by a low platelet count, and decreased platelet survival as antibody- 
coated platelets are removed by the reticuloendothelial system. Megakaryocyte numbers in 
the bone marrow are increased in a compensatory effort. Patients can present at any age 
with unexplained bleeding and petechiae. 
Diagnosis of ITP is based on the platelet count, bone marrow findings and sometimes 
the presence of anti-platelet antibodies. Exclusion of infection, immunodeficiency, 
malignancy and systemic disease is essential. Effective treatments include steroids, anabolic 
steroids, immunosuppression, high dose IVIg (short-term effect only), cytotoxic agents 
(to reduce antibody production) and splenectomy (to reduce removal of platelets from 
circulation).

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
ANTIBODY-MEDIATED HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA 
Antibody-mediated haemolytic anaemia includes: 
¢ 
 Alloimmune haemolytic anaemia 
¢ 
Drug-induced haemolytic anaemia 
¢ 
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. 
Red blood cells (RBCs) are vulnerable to complement-mediated lysis as, unlike nucleated 
cells, they are unable to repair their cell membrane following insertion of the membrane 
attack complex. Antibody-coated RBCs may also be removed by the reticuloendothelial 
system. Antibodies to RBCs may be detected by the direct and indirect Coomb’s tests. 
Alloimmune haemolysis 
This complicates ABO incompatible transfusion and preformed isohaemagglutinins lead to 
potentially fatal massive haemolysis. Rhesus disease of the newborn occurs when maternal 
anti-D from a sensitised Rhesus-negative mother crosses the placenta and damages Rhesus- 
positive RBCs in the foetus. Rhesus-negative mothers develop anti-Rhesus antibodies in 
response to transfusions or pregnancies. Sensitisation following pregnancy is prevented by 
giving Rhesus-negative mothers anti-D, destroying Rhesus-positive cells before an immune 
response is generated. 
Drug-induced haemolysis 
This occurs by three different mechanisms: 
¢ 
Drug binds to the RBC acting as a hapten. Anti-drug antibodies bind the drug 
and incidentally destroy the RBC. Haemolysis usually stops once 
the drug is 
withdrawn. 
# 
RBCs may be destroyed as innocent bystanders. Protein bound drug in the vicinity of 
the RBC is bound by antibody and complement activation leads to destruction of the 
nearby RBC. 
¢ 
Some drugs such as methyldopa can trigger a true autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, 
which persists for months despite drug withdrawal. 
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia 
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is divided into warm and cold types, depending 
on whether the pathogenic antibody is functional at 4°C or 37°C (Table 2.16.1). 
Warm AIHA often runs a relapsing-remitting course, and may be associated with 
splenomegaly. Treatment includes removal or treatment of any underlying cause, steroids, 
cytotoxics, high dose IVIg and possibly splenectomy. 
Cold AIHA usually presents with haemolysis aggravated by cold, often associated with 
Raynaud’s phenomenon. Infection associated cases may be transient. Treatment includes 
treatment of the underlying cause, keeping the patient warm and occasionally alkylating agents. 
IMMUNE-MEDIATED NEUTROPAENIA 
Alloimmune neutropaenia can result from transplacental transfer of maternal antibody. 
Autoimmune neutropaenia may occur in isolation or more commonly as part of a systemic

with profound neutropaenia (Figure 2.16.1).

Aplastic anaemia (AA) causes reductions in all three cell lines and the bone marrow appears 
empty. AA occurs in response to toxins including drugs, infections or may be idiopathic. 
Many idiopathic cases are due to a cellular immune response against haematological 
185 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
precursors. This may respond to ATG and cyclosporin. Bone marrow transplantation may 
be curative. 
ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME 
186 
Antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS) 
is an immune-mediated 
cause 
of thrombophilia. 
Antibodies against negatively charged phospholipids involved in the coagulation cascade 
induce a prothrombotic state. Antibody binding to the phospholipid cardiolipin is dependent 
on the presence of a co-factor called 62-glycoprotein 1. 8 -glycoprotein 1 is an anticoagulant, 
and its inhibition may contribute to the procoagulant state. 
APS may occur in isolation (primary APS) or associated with connective tissue disease, 
usually SLE (secondary APS). Establishing a diagnosis of APS requires clinical and 
laboratory criteria. 
Laboratory criteria include: 
* 
Moderate 
or strong IgG or IgM anti-cardiolipin antibody in a {8 -glycoprotein 
1 dependent assay. 
* 
Lupus anticoagulant. 
The laboratory abnormality must be demonstrated on two occasions, at least 8 weeks 
apart. Many patients are positive for both lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin 
antibodies, 10% are positive in one test only. 
Clinical criteria for the diagnosis include: 
@ 
Vascular thrombosis, venous or arterial, in the absence of another cause. 
* 
Pregnancy associated morbidity, including early delivery of a baby before 32 weeks 
because of severe pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation; pregnancy loss due 
to miscarriage or intrauterine death in the second or third trimester; three first 
trimester miscarriages. 
Other clinical features of APS include thrombocytopaenia, livedo reticularis, transverse 
myelopathy and migraine. However, these features are not specific enough to be diagnostic 
criteria. 
Treatment consists of high dose aspirin or life long anticoagulation in patients who have 
experienced thrombotic complications. Management of pregnancy is particularly challenging, 
requiring self-administration of heparin (warfarin is teratogenic) together with very close mon- 
itoring of the pregnancy. Immunosuppressive therapy is not routinely indicated for APS, but 
may be used in specific circumstances under the guidance of a specialist.

Autoimmune Liver Diseases 
Chronic hepatitis is defined as persistent lymphoid inflammation of portal tracts, liver 
lobules, or bile ducts (intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic) lasting more than 6 months. 
Progression 
to cirrhosis and liver failure occurs 
in many cases. 
Predisposition 
to 
hepatocellular carcinoma is a feature in some patients. Many factors are implicated in 
causation. These include: 
* 
Infections (Hepatitis B and C viruses) 
* 
Toxins (most notably alcohol; some drugs) 
* 
Metabolic/genetic 
(haemachromatosis; 
Wilson’s 
disease; 
alpha-1 
antitrypsin 
deficiency). 
Autoimmunity is implicated in a number of important clinical entities. Specific patterns of 
autoantibody reactivity, association with other autoimmune conditions and, in the case of 
chronic autoimmune hepatitis (CAH), good responses to steroid therapy are characteristic. 
AUTOIMMUNE (CHRONIC ACTIVE) HEPATITIS 
Clinical features 
This is predominantly a disorder of young and middle-aged women. Symptoms of acute 
but persisting hepatitis (jaundice, malaise, profound tiredness) are common. Clinical 
recovery followed by later relapse occurs, but about half of patients continue to mani- 
fest clinical features of ongoing inflammation. Some patients present for the first time 
with features of hepatic compromise indicating cirrhosis 
(bleeding varices, ascites, 
encephalopathy). 
Characteristically, extrahepatic features are present. Arthralgia, autoimmune endocrine 
disease, immune-mediated haematological disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and 
vitiligo are all described. 
187 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Laboratory diagnosis 
Elevated transaminases and hypergammaglobulinaemia (IgG mainly) are typical findings. 
Hepatitis virus screening is negative as are tests for other aetiological factors as outlined 
above. Lymphoid inflammation of varying extent and severity with features of established 
cirrhosis is seen on biopsy material. Distinct patterns of autoantibody positivity are highly 
supportive of the diagnosis. A number of sub-types are now recognised based on the precise 
patterns of autoantibodies detected. 
Type 1 — Autoimmune ‘lupoid’ hepatitis 
This sub-type represents the classical form of autoimmune hepatitis and is also called 
lupoid hepatitis because of the prevalence of extrahepatic features common in SLE (e.g. 
arthralgia). Lupoid also refers to the usual finding of high titres of ANA. High titre smooth 
muscle antibodies and ds-DNA antibodies are also detected. Most cases occur in women 
and presentation in the thirties is usual. 
Type 2 — LKM hepatitis 
Antibodies to liver/kidney microsomes (LKM) are seen in some patients with autoimmune 
CAH where the typical ANA/smooth muscle autoantibody pattern is absent. This antibody 
interacts specifically with cytochrome P450. This pattern tends to occur in cases presenting 
in childhood. Girls are predominantly affected. Extrahepatic manifestations are prominent 
and progression is rapid. 
Type 3 — CAH 
Soluble liver antibodies (anti-SLA) distinguish this type of CAH. Less commonly, ANA and 
anti-smooth muscle antibodies 
are detected. Adult women 
are again predominantly 
affected. Characteristically, extrahepatic manifestations are not common. 
Type 4 — CAH 
This refers to cases of CAH where anti-mitochondrial antibody reactivity coexists. The 
latter antibody is found in high titres in most cases of primary biliary cirrhosis — a condition 
discussed later in this section. Outlook in these patients is less clear than in classical 
autoimmune hepatitis but is probably poorer. 
Treatment 
188 
Control of inflammation and support of liver function are the mainstays of therapy. 
* 
Steroids are effective, although variation in responsiveness of the different sub-types 
may occur. More detailed studies are required to identify best therapy options for each 
subtype. 
¢ 
Azathioprine is commonly used as a steroid sparing agent with good effect. Other 
immunosuppressants like Cyclosporin A are less commonly used. 
¢ 
Liver failure regime and even liver transplantation may be required in patients with 
progressive decompensation. 
AUTOIMMUNE LIVER DISEASES 
Case 2.17.1 Autoimmune hepatitis 
A 30-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of fatigue and joint pains. 
For the preceding 4 weeks she had upper abdominal pain and nausea, as well as 
pruritis. On examination her liver was enlarged and tender. Her GP suspected that 
she may have liver disease, and liver function tests suggested hepatitis with serum 
transaminases over 10 times the upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase was 
only mildly elevated. 
| 
Further investigations showed a strongly positive anti-smooth muscle antibody, 
together with a positive ANA and marked polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia (IgG 
28 g/l). Viral studies were negative. A liver biopsy showed periportal inflammation 
with lymphocytes and plasma cells present, together with necrosis of hepatocytes. 
— 
A diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis Type I was made. 
Treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine was commenced. Within one 
month she felt much better and liver function tests had improved considerably. Liver 
| 
chemistry and immunoglobulins (Igs) were normal after 3 months. Steroid therapy 
was gradually tapered over the following months and azathioprine was continued to 
reduce the risk of relapse.

_ PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS 
Clinical features 
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a condition of middle-aged and older women. The 
pathological 
lesion 
is one of progressive destructive fibrosing inflammation 
in the 
intrahepatic bile ducts leading to cholestasis and eventual cirrhosis. Tiredness and 
intractable itch are marked features. Progression is associated with features of hyper- 
lipidaemia, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (e.g. osteoporosis due to vitamin D deficiency) 
and eventual cirrhosis and decompensation. PBC is associated with other autoimmune 
conditions, most notably Sjégren’s syndrome, CREST variant of scleroderma and 
autoimmune thyroid disease. 
Laboratory findings 
An elevated alkaline phosphatase level is the dominant biochemical disturbance 
at 
presentation and is a persisting feature. Variable elevations in transaminases and other 
evidence of hepatic decompensation occur with progression. Hypergammaglobulinaemia, 
mainly IgM, is common. Most patients have detectable mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) 
by IIF and this is a highly useful diagnostic tool. There are many subtypes of AMA but the 
M2 subtype is typical in PBC. The target antigen is the E2 component of pyruvate 
dehydrogenase. The role of the antibody in pathogenesis is unclear. Antibody titres do not 
vary with progression. 
189 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Treatment 
* 
Symptomatic relief of itch (cholestyramine), control of cholesterol (statin therapy, diet) 
and osteoporosis prevention (calcium and vitamin D supplements, exercise) are all 
important therapeutic interventions. 
* 
Steroids are contraindicated because of the potential to worsen osteoporosis. 
Many immunosuppressive agents have been used but results are disappointing. 
* 
Ursodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid, is widely used. Biochemical improvement is seen and 
rate of progression is slowed. 
* 
Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice in advanced cases. 
Sd 
SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS 
190 
Stricturing patchy inflammation of the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts with episodic 
cholangitis 
characterises 
this 
disorder. 
Progression 
to 
cirrhosis 
is _ typical. 
Cholangiocarcinoma occurs with increased frequency. There is a strong association with 
ulcerative colitis. 
Biochemical findings are similar to those found in PBC. Mitochondrial antibodies are 
not found. An atypical ANCA is detected in some patients. 
Immunosuppression is unhelpful. Ursodeoxycholic acid may improve outlook and is 
usually prescribed. Transplantation is indicated in patients with advanced hepatic dysfunc- 
tion. This is contraindicated if cholangiocarcinoma has developed so detailed investigation 
to rule out this complication is needed in the pre-transplant work-up.

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
SPECIFIC IMMUNE-MEDIATED GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE 
Atrophic gastritis and pernicious anaemia 
Atrophic gastritis results in lymphocytic infiltration, mucosal atrophy, impaired acid pro- 
duction and deficiency of intrinsic factor. Autoreactive T cells damage the proton pump in 
gastric parietal cells (GPC). Anti-GPC antibodies, present in 90% of patients, are epiphe- 
nomena. Atrophic autoimmune gastritis is usually asymptomatic. 
Atrophic gastritis may progress to pernicious anaemia (PA), if vitamin B, absorption is 
compromised due to depletion of GPCs or the additional effect of anti-intrinsic factor (IF) anti- 
bodies, which block the action of IE PA results in a megaloblastic anaemia and neurological 
complications (peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration and dementia), which 
can be reversed by regular parenteral vitamin By, if treatment is initiated early. 
PA is associated with other organ-specific autoimmune disease, particularly thyroid 
disease, as well as an increased risk of gastric cancer. 
Coeliac disease 
192 
Coeliac disease results from a hypersensitivity reaction to gliadin (present in wheat, barley 
and rye glutens) occurring in the small intestine of genetically susceptible individuals. 
Predisposing factors include Celtic origin, positive family history, IgA deficiency, expression 
of a particular HLA haplotype (HLA-B8, DR3, DQ2), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
and Down’s syndrome. Prevalence in western European countries may be as high as one per 
hundred of the population. 
Pathological changes are most marked in the proximal GIT and include lymphocytic 
inflammation and villous atrophy. Anti-endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase anti- 
bodies (>95%) and anti-gliadin antibodies (>50%) are typically present in serum. 
The cause appears to be an abnormal immune response to gluten — gluten exposure is 
essential and gliadin-specific T cells appear in the small intestine within hours of gluten 
exposure. 
Clinical presentation is variable: 
Failure to thrive; fatigue; weight loss 
Anaemia 
Osteoporosis, osteomalacia 
Infertility 
Recurrent aphthous ulceration 
Malabsorption 
Associated dermatitis herpetiformis 
Small bowel lymphoma (rarely)

Hyposplenism 
Asymptomatic.

OOO 
While originally described as a paediatric disease, coeliac disease is often diagnosed in 
adults, even in the elderly. The availability of serological tests, together with a higher 
awareness has improved detection. 
Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Serological tests for IgA anti-endomysial, 
anti-tissue transglutaminase, and anti-gliadin antibodies are useful. If IgA deficiency is pres- 
ent, eee is less helpful. Small bowel biopsy showing typical features remains the gold 
standard. 
IMMUNE-MEDIATED GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS 
Treatment 
requires 
lifelong 
dietary 
exclusion 
of gluten. 
Failure 
to comply 
increases symptoms, 
as well 
as anaemia, osteoporosis and the risk of developing 
small bowel lymphoma. Supplements (iron, folate, vitamin D and calcium) may be 
required. 
Inflammatory bowel diseases 
Crohn’s 
disease and Ulcerative 
Colitis (UC) are chronic, relapsing and remitting, 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). There are distinct epidemiological, clinical and 
pathological features, however, in some patients it is difficult to differentiate Crohn’s 
disease from UC. 
IBDs are most prevalent in Western countries (combined incidence 15-20/100,000 
population). Crohn’s disease incidence continues to grow. 
There are racial and genetic (high twin concordance; 10% have positive family history) 
risk factors. However, environmental triggers including diet and smoking appear to play a 
role. 
Pathogenesis remains 
unclear, however, dysregulated inflammatory responses 
to 
antigens, 
possibly normal bowel 
flora, in genetically predisposed individuals 
is 
probably important. Unidentified persistent infection remains possible, but unlikely. 
Pro-inflammatory TH1-type cytokines like TNF-a mediate the inflammation of Crohn’s 
disease. 
Pathological features are distinct. Crohn’s disease affects any part of the GIT from 
mouth to anus, often with a patchy distribution (skip-lesions); UC is limited to the colon 
and rectum, most severe distally with continuous proximal spreading. Stricture and fistula 
formation are highly suggestive of Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s inflammation is transmural 
with non-caseating granulomata and fibrosis. UC is limited to the mucosal layer and crypt 
abscesses are typical. Intermediate histological features occur sometimes making precise 
classification difficult. 
Clinical presentation depends on the location and severity of inflammation. Common 
presenting features include diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, peri-anal disease, 
fistulae, malnutrition and systemic upset due to inflammation. Extra-intestinal manifesta- 
tions (sero-negative arthritis, uveitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, scleros- 
ing cholangitis, aphthous ulceration) occur in both conditions. Long-standing UC can be 
complicated by colon cancer. 
Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation together with endoscopic, radiological and 
histological findings. Haematological, biochemical and inflammatory markers help to 
monitor disease severity. P-ANCA (non-MPO) activity is detected in the serum of some 
IBD patients and may indicate those at increased risk of developing primary sclerosing 
cholangitis. 
Treatment includes: 
¢ 
Anti-inflammatory drugs — aminosalicylic acid derivatives and corticosteroids (topical 
and systemic). 
¢ 
Immunomodulation 
-— 
Azathioprine, 
6-Mercaptopurine, 
Cyclosporin 
A and 
Methotrexate. Anti-TNF therapies (e.g. infliximab) have revolutionised management of 
severe Crohn’s disease. 
¢ 
Nutritional support, elemental diets for severe small bowel Crohn’s disease. 
¢ 
Probiotic microbes may play a role in prevention and treatment of IBD in the 
future. 
¢ 
Antibiotics and surgery may be required.

Immune-mediated 
Neurological Disease 
The brain is relatively isolated from the immune system by the blood brain barrier (BBB), 
which consists of endothelium with tight junctions, a basal lamina and perivascular end- 
feet of astrocytic processes. Functionally the BBB prevents large molecules and most cells 
from crossing cerebral vessels. BBB permeability increases at sites of inflammation, 
allowing entry of cells and plasma proteins. 
The brain is poorly supplied by lymphatics, however, CNS antigens, and some glial cells 
with antigen presenting capabilities can exit the CNS, migrate to cervical lymph nodes, and 
elicit an immune response. 
The brain, spinal cord and nerves are targets of several immune-mediated diseases. Some 
solely involve the CNS, however, neurological disease may occur in non-organ specific 
autoimmune disease such as SLE. 
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS 
In myasthenia gravis (MG), antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) inhibit 
neuromuscular transmission, causing weakness and fatigability of muscles. Disease severity 
varies from weakness of orbital muscles, causing drooping of the eyelid and double vision, 
to profound weakness involving respiratory muscles 
that may be life threatening. 
Thymoma or thymic hyperplasia is often associated.

Multiple sclerosis 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Anti-AChR antibodies are pathogenic and transplacental passage of anti-AChR causes 
transient disease in neonates. Antibodies bind the AChR, blocking receptor function. 
Anti-AChR also activates complement, resulting in internalisation of AChR and damage to 
the motor endplate. 
Treatment of MG is usually with anticholinesterase drugs, which increase the amount of 
acetylcholine present at the motor endplate, improving impulse conduction, often with 
immunosuppression 
to 
reduce 
autoantibody 
production. 
Antibody 
removal 
by 
plasmapheresis is also useful. 
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE) 
SLE is an immune complex deposition disease, discussed 
in detail in Section 2.23. 
Involvement of cerebral blood vessels can cause highly variable neurological symptoms 
including seizures, neuropsychiatric disorders and focal neurological signs. 
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which episodes of inflammation 
occur in the CNS disseminated in time and place. MS may run a relapsing-remitting or 
progressive course. The effects of inflammation may be visualised as plaques on MRI 
scanning. Inflammation damages the myelin sheath around nerves, and demyelination 
slows nerve conduction causing symptoms. Inflammation and demyelination also lead 
to secondary axonal loss, leading to long-term disability. Suspected diagnosis is usually 
based on history and MRI appearances. Oligoclonal bands of immunoglobulin in the CSF 
support the diagnosis. 
Attacks of MS may be shortened by treatment with high dose steroids, which reduce 
inflammation. IFN-B reduces the number and severity of attacks in a number of patients, 
through an unknown mechanism. IFN-f causes fever and flu-like symptoms, which many 
MS patients are unable to tolerate. 
CROSS REACTIVITY AND IMMUNE-MEDIATED 
NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE 
Several autoimmune disorders are thought to result from cross-reactivity between self- 
antigen and pathogens or tumours. 
« 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) 
GBS is an inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, thought to be due to cross-reactivity 
of gangliosides in nerves and bacteria, particularly Campylobacter jejuni. Anti-GM1 anti- 
bodies, frequently found in GBS, cross-react with lipopolysaccharides present in this 
microbe. GBS presents with ascending weakness, which may progress rapidly to involve 
respiratory and bulbar muscles. Sensory symptoms are mild, but autonomic involvement 
may be life-threatening. Most patients recover, often over months or years. 
The progression of GBS may be halted by early treatment with plasmapheresis or 
high-dose immunoglobulin. Plasmapheresis is dangerous if autonomic instability is present and 
therefore immunoglobulin is more commonly used. 
196 
IMMUNE-MEDIATED NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic form of GBS. 
Diagnosis is based on history, neurophysiological demonstration of demyelination and 
exclusion of other causes of neuropathy. Autoantibodies to gangliosides are often present, 
however, a clear history of infection preceding onset is rare. Weakness is prominent but sen- 
sory symptoms can also be disabling. Treatment is usually with high-dose IVIg but may also 
include steroids, immunosuppressive agents, and plasmapheresis. 
Cross-reactivity with tumours — paraneoplastic syndromes 
Paraneoplastic syndromes are distant non-metastatic effects of tumours. Cerebellar degen- 
eration causing ataxia is a frequent manifestation of these rare conditions, although varied 
presentations are described. Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes result from antibodies 
raised against neoantigens on tumour cells cross-reacting with brain tissue. The tumour is 
often very small — held in check by an aggressive immune response. However, this immune 
response causes severe neurological disease. Patients usually present with neurological dis- 
ease and the tumour may only become apparent later or even at autopsy. Paraneoplastic 
syndromes are associated with tumours of lung, breast and ovary most commonly.

Immune-mediated Skin 
Disease 
Intact skin forms a natural barrier to infection. Skin contains specialised antigen presenting 
cells (APCs) (Langerhan’s cells), which take up antigen and migrate to regional lymph nodes. 
While essential in fighting infection, this efficient capacity to present antigen to the immune 
system facilitates the development of hypersensitivity and autoimmune disease. Skin may be 
involved in many multisystem autoimmune diseases, and skin biopsy often with direct 
immunofluorescence provides an easy means to establish the diagnosis (Figure 2.20.1). 
Skin involvement is common in some types of immunodeficiency — T cell defects result 
in viral and fungal eruptions, while neutrophil dysfunction may present with boils and 
abscesses. Many immunodeficiencies are associated with immune dysregulation, which may 
result in eczematous rashes. 
IMMUNE-MEDIATED BLISTERING SKIN 
CONDITIONS 
Pemphigus 
Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus 
are 
serious diseases characterised 
by 
intraepidermal blister formation. Autoantibodies react with components of the desmosome 
(adhesion complexes which maintain the integrity of the epidermis). Antibody binding 
results in complement activation, weakening the desmosome. Keratinocytes separate result- 
ing in blister formation. Biopsy findings are of intraepidermal blister formation, while 
direct immunofluorescence shows linear staining with IgG and often C3 in a chicken 
wire pattern, surrounding keratinocytes. 
Indirect immunofluorescence 
(often using 
monkey oesophagus as a substrate) detects circulating antibody, and the antibody titre is 
useful for monitoring disease. Treatment is with high dose steroids and additional 
immunosuppression with an agent such as azathioprine. 
Bullous pemphigoid 
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a blistering disease, predominantly affecting elderly patients. 
Itchy tense blisters develop on the trunk and limbs, and mucous membranes are affected in

about 30%. Skin biopsy shows subepidermal blisters, and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) 
shows linear deposition of IgG, often with C3 along the dermoepidermal junction 
(DEJ). This autoantibody is thought to be pathogenic and is directed against components 
of the hemidesmosome, which anchors keratinocytes to the basement membrane. Antibody 
binding and resultant complement activation leads to an infiltration of neutrophils. 
Neutrophils discharge proteases, weakening the hemidesmosome, allowing subsequent 
blister formation. Antibodies are detected in serum in about 70% of patients, however, 
autoantibody titre does not reflect disease activity. Mild disease may respond to topical 
steroids, however, oral steroids often with additional immunosuppression are usually 
required. 
Cicatricial pemphigoid 
This is a mucosal variant of BP, which affects conjunctivae, oral mucosa and vaginal 
mucosa. Subepithelial fibrosis can occur. Systemic treatment is usually required. 
Herpes gestationis 
Herpes gestationis (HG) is a BP variant, occurring only in pregnancy and the puerperium. 
Linear C3 is found on DIF. The baby may be affected due to transplacental passage of 
antibody.

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS 
Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an intensely itchy, blistering disease, involving extensor 
surfaces, often associated with coeliac disease or subclinical gluten sensitivity. Skin biopsy 
demonstrates accumulations of neutrophils in the papillary tips. Direct immunofluorescence 
shows deposits of IgA and occasionally C3 and/or 
fibrin 
in the papillary tips. 
Anti-endomysial antibodies are present in up to 70% of patients. DH may respond to 
gluten withdrawal or treatment with dapsone.

This condition usually presents with palpable purpura but occasionally with urticarial 
lesions or angioedema. Immune complexes deposited in dermal blood vessels activate 
complement and attract neutrophils. Histological examination of a fresh lesion shows 
vasculitis (inflammation of the vessel wall), leucocytoclasis (breakdown of neutrophils) and 
fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall. DIF shows granular deposits of immunoglobulins and 
complement in vessel walls. Causes include Type III hypersensitivity to drugs, infection 
including bacterial endocarditis, connective tissue diseases and cryoglobulinaemia.

CONTACT DERMATITIS 
This condition is due to delayed hypersensitivity to allergens adsorbed to keratinocytes. 
These allergens frequently act as haptens, forming neoantigens, which are taken up by 
Langerhan’s cells, and transported to regional lymph nodes where they activate T cells. The 
expanded clones of allergen-reactive T cells migrate to skin and activate macrophages as 
well as releasing proinflammatory cytokines. The diagnosis may be made on the clinical 
appearance of the rash and its distribution, as well as a careful history of exposure to pos- 
sible sensitisers. Patch testing is then used to confirm the putative causative agents, and 
avoidance measures determined.

Immune-mediated Renal 
Disease 
(202 
Immune-mediated renal disease may be isolated or result from kidney involvement in sys- 
temic disease. Clinically, kidney disease presents with: 
¢ 
Renal impairment — kidneys fail to clear waste material normally. Renal impairment (or fail- 
ure) may be acute or chronic, and result from pre-renal, renal or post-renal causes. 
@ 
Haematuria which may be frank (visible to the patient) or microscopic (only detectable 
on urinalysis). 
¢ 
Nephritic syndrome — haematuria, hypertension and oliguria (reduced urinary output). 
¢ 
Proteinuria. 
. 
@ 
Nephrotic syndrome — proteinuria (>3g/24 hours), hypoalbuminaemia and oedema. 
No type of presentation is specific for immunological disease. All types of hypersensitivity 
can cause renal disease (Table 2.21.1). Renal biopsy is often required to establish the diag- 
nosis, and in suspected immunological disease a portion of the biopsy should be frozen for 
direct immunofluorescence examination. 
Allergic interstitial nephritis may result from an infection or drug exposure (NSAIDs and 
antibiotics commonly). Connective tissue diseases can also cause interstitial nephritis. An 
underlying cause is not always identified. Fever, rash and eosinophilia may be present. 
Haematuria, pyuria and white cell casts in the urine may precede renal impairment. 
Eosinophils may also be present in the urinary sediment. Histological examination of renal 
tissue shows a mononuclear infiltrate with eosinophilia associated with tubular injury. 
Antibody deposition may be seen along the tubular basement membrane. The essential 
aspect of treatment is discontinuation of the offending drug, and corticosteroids may be 
helpful. 
Goodpasture’s disease is a classic antibody-mediated disease. Antibodies to glomerular 
basement membrane (GBM) bind to glomeruli, activate complement and cause severe 
glomerular inflammation, 
resulting in severe crescentic glomerulonephritis. 
Clinically 
rapidly progressive renal failure with haematuria ensues. Antibodies to GBM can bind to 
pulmonary basement membrane, causing pulmonary haemorrhage. When suspected, anti- 
GBM are measured 
as an emergency. Treatment includes plasmapheresis to remove 
antibodies rapidly, corticosteroids and potent immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide.

Case 2.21.1 Pulmonary renal syndrome 
A 28-year-old male smoker complained of breathlessness and cough productive of 
blood-stained sputum. He had been unwell for 3 weeks, and his GP arranged for urgent 
admission to hospital. While in the admissions unit he had a large haemoptysis of 
approximately 500 mls of blood. Chest X-rays showed alveolar shadowing in both lower 
lobes. Urinalysis revealed microscopic haematuria, and serum creatinine was raised at 
130 pmols/l. Urgent measurement of anti-GBM (glomerular basement membrane) anti- 
bodies and ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) demonstrated the presence 
of anti-GBM. 
He was started on plasmapheresis together with cyclophosphamide and steroids. 
He continued to produce blood stained sputum for a further three days. By day 4, 
haematuria was reduced to a trace and serum creatinine had fallen to 80 wmols/l. 
Anti-GBM antibodies were no longer detectable. Plasmapheresis was stopped and the 
steroid dose was tapered. Cyclophosphamide was continued for several months and 
then azathioprine was given for a further year. He remained anti-GBM antibody neg- 
ative, and had no recurrence of haemoptysis or haematuria.

IgA NEPHROPATHY 
This is the commonest glomerular disease identified in native kidney biopsies. IgA-containing 
immune complexes (ICs) are deposited in the mesangium extending into capillary loops 
in severe disease (Figure 2.21.1). IgA deposits are usually associated with mild mesangial 
changes, however, occasionally crescents and severe glomerular inflammation are seen. 
Clinically, patients present with microscopic or frank haematuria. Proteinuria indicates severe

disease. Renal impairment can occur with progression to renal failure usually over many 
years. Severe disease can be treated with steroids and cytotoxic therapy, however, toxicity is 
significant. In mild disease management it is limited to blood pressure control with no spe- 
cific therapy. Renal involvement in Henoch-SchGnlein purpura is histologically indistinguish- 
able from IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy can recur following transplantation. 
MEMBRANOUS GLOMERULONEPHRITIS 
204 
Deposition of immune complexes on the epithelial side of the GBM is seen. Rapid urine 
flow washes away complement and chemoattractants, so an inflammatory response to ICs 
does not occur. Patients present with nephrotic syndrome, and renal impairment may 
progress slowly. Underlying causes include tumours, infections, drugs and SLE, however, 
most cases are idiopathic. Spontaneous remission may occur, particularly where a remediable 
IMMUNE-MEDIATED RENAL DISEASE 
cause is corrected. Some patients are treated with intensive steroids and chlorambucil, 
which is beneficial but highly toxic. 
MEMBRANOPROLIFERATIVE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS 
Three major types of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) are described. 
MPGN Type I results from deposition of ICs predominantly on the endothelial side of the 
GBM while MPGN Type III is characterised by both subendothelial and subepithelial ICs. 
Complement activation results in marked inflammation. MPGN Type II is due to com- 
plement activation and deposition by an autoantibody, nephritic factor. MPGN is often 
idiopathic, 
but may be associated 
with chronic 
infection, complement deficiency, 
cryoglobulinaemia and some tumours. The clinical presentation may be nephritic syn- 
drome, haematuria, incidental proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome. Low complement levels 
are typical. Most patients progress to renal failure, although at highly differing rates 
(Figure 2.21.2). Treatments include steroids and anti-platelet agents. MPGN frequently 
recurs in transplanted kidneys. 
POST-INFECTIOUS GLOMERULONEPHRITIS 
This may follow several bacterial, viral and parasitic infections, with post-streptococcal 
glomerulonephritis 
the 
best 
characterised 
example. 
Presentations 
vary 
from 
transient haematuria and proteinuria 
to nephritic syndrome and occasionally renal 
failure. ICs are deposited in the mesangium and subepithelial areas. C3 and IgG may be 
identified on DIF. Hypocomplementaemia is typical, and serological evidence of infection 
may be identified. When spontaneous recovery occurs, biopsy is unnecessary. 
RENAL INVOLVEMENT IN SLE 
This manifests as one of a variety of types of glomerulonephritis and is part of a systemic IC 
deposition disease. Lupus nephritis commonly shows a diffuse proliferative pattern like 
MPGN or a membranous pattern of injury. 
ANCA-ASSOCIATED FOCAL NECROTISING 
GLOMERULONEPHRITIS 
This condition may be renal-limited, or a manifestation of systemic disease. The mechanism 
of tissue injury remains to be fully elucidated, however, ANCA may play a pathogenetic 
role. Patients frequently develop rapidly progressive renal failure, however, the clinical 
course may be insidious. Haematuria is usually present in active disease. Renal biopsy 
shows a focal necrotising glomerulonephritis with crescents indicating severe glomerular 
injury. Immune deposits are not seen in renal tissue. When suspected, ANCA should be 
requested on an urgent basis as renal failure progresses rapidly. Early treatment with 
steroids, cyclophosphamide and occasionally plasmapheresis may reverse renal failure, 
even in patients who are dialysis-dependent.

This is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Renal biopsy appears 
normal on light microscopy and direct immunofluorescence, however, fusion of podocytes 
is seen on electron microscopy. The disease is thought to be T cell mediated, and treatment 
with steroids is usually successful. If steroids fail, or relapse occurs after tapering steroids, 
cyclophosphamide or cyclosporin are used.

Rheumatoid Disease and 
Spondylarthropathies 
Rheumatoid disease (RA) is a multisystem disease, typically characterised by inflammatory 
arthritis. However, many organs may be affected, with or without joint involvement 
(Figure 2.22.1). 
RA affects approximately 1% of Caucasian populations, with a higher prevalence in 
some Native American populations, and lower rates in oriental and rural African popula- 
tions. Peak age of onset is uncertain and female: male ratio is 3: 1. There is a well-recognised 
genetic predisposition, explained in part by expression of particular alleles of DR4 and 
closely related DR1 alleles. The disease-associated HLA alleles show close similarities 
in the antigen-binding groove, suggesting that all are capable of presenting identical or 
similar disease related peptide(s). 
Typically RA is characterised by stiff inflamed joints, in a symmetrical pattern. Several 
joints, particularly the small joints of the hands are involved. Approximately 20% of 
patients have rheumatoid nodules in subcutaneous tissues, found over bony prominences. 
Up to 90% of subjects are rheumatoid factor (RF) positive, however, weakly positive RF is 
not specific for RA, Detection of antibodies against citrullinated peptides are promising as 
a tool in early diagnosis. X-rays of hands or other affected joints may show bony erosions. 
RA can cause vasculitis (inflammation in blood vessels), and this complication may 
affect small blood vessels (usually associated with active arthritis), or medium-sized vessels 
(occurring even when joint disease is quiescent). A small proportion of patients with RA 
develop neutropaenia and splenomegaly, a triad known as Felty’s syndrome. Pulmonary 
manifestations include pulmonary nodules (which are usually asymptomatic), pleural effu- 
sions, interstitial lung disease and bronchiolitis obliterans (a devastating scarring process in 
the small airways carrying a very poor prognosis). Ocular complications include dry eyes 
(usually indicating associated Sjégren’s syndrome), episcleritis and scleritis (inflammation 
on the surface and in the sclera). Occasionally scleritis may be severe, resulting in sclero- 
malacia and perforation of the orbit. As in other chronic inflammatory conditions, patients 
may develop amyloidosis, a non-inflammatory deposition of extracellular material result- 
ing in organ dysfunction associated with a poor prognosis. 
The pattern of progression of RA is variable. Arthritis may present abruptly or insidi- 
ously and may involve one or several joints at the outset. Occasionally patients may have

only extraarticular disease with no evidence of joint disease. The majority of patients 
follow a relapsing and remitting course, however, a small subgroup follows a relentless 
progressive course. Up to 20% of patients have a monocyclic disease followed by recovery.

and 
anti-inflammatory 
drugs

used 
for

control. 
Immunosuppressing agents used either singly or in combination are a central component in 
disease control. Early intervention with such drugs is increasingly used. Cytokine blockade 
(anti- TNF-a, IL-1) is revolutionising treatment of RA. 
The pathology of affected joints shows a chronic widespread synovitis with lymphocytic 
infiltration and evidence of macrophage activation. 
The inflamed synovium gives rise to pannus, at the synovial interface with cartilage and 
bone. Pannus is unique to RA and is locally invasive, destroying cartilage and bone and 
giving rise to marginal erosions. Joint destruction is thought to be driven by T cell activa- 
tion of macrophages. It remains controversial how much Type III hypersensitivity (result- 
ing from immune complex formation by RF and normal Ig) contributes to joint damage 
(Figure 2.22.2). Rheumatoid vasculitis is thought to be primarily an immune complex 
mediated (Type III) process. 
SPONDYLARTHROPATHIES 
The spondylarthropathies are a group of seronegative (RF negative) inflammatory arthri- 
tides. Ankylosing spondylitis is the typical example, primarily affecting the spine and

sacroiliac joints. Inflammation in the spine gradually progresses and results in fusion 
and deformity of the spine. Peripheral joints may also be involved. There is a striking 
association with expression of HLA-B27. Many patients have antibodies to Klebsiella 
species, suggesting previous infection, however, organisms are not isolated from the 
joint. The observation that anti-Klebsiella antibodies can bind HLA-B27 has raised interest 
in molecular 
mimicry 
as 
the 
possible 
mechanism 
for autoimmunity 
in_ 
this 
condition. However, cross reactivity with HLA-B27 cannot explain why the disease 
localises 
in the spine, sacroiliac 
joints and occasionally the eyes. Elucidating the 
mechanisms 
underlying 
this disorder 
will probably give considerable 
insights into 
autoimmunity. 
Closely related spondylarthropathies include reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with 
inflammatory bowel disease, and a form of psoriatic arthritis. The spondylarthropathies 
may be associated with inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye (anterior uveitis or 
iritis). 
Reactive arthritis follows a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection with organisms such 
as Chlamydia, Campylobacter, Shigella or Yersinia. As with ankylosing spondylitis, there 
is a striking association with HLA-B27. The association with infection and a particular 
HLA type again suggests some form of immune cross-reactivity, however this has not been 
conclusively demonstrated. 
In many patients, reactive arthritis resolves after several 
months, however, in others the disease follows a relapsing or chronic course. This suggests 
loss of self-tolerance, resulting in ongoing inflammation, even after elimination of the 
pathogen.

Case 2.22.1 Inflammatory polyarthritis 
A 30-year-old woman developed pain, stiffness and swelling in the small joints of her 
hands. A few weeks later her wrists and feet became affected. Her GP prescribed 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Six weeks later she returned to her 
GP as her joints became more swollen. Blood tests showed a normochromic, 
normocytic anaemia, and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive 
protein (CRP) consistent with an inflammatory process. Rheumatoid factor was 
strongly positive, and anti-nuclear factor was also positive. Anti-double stranded 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens were 
negative. Her GP prescribed stronger anti-inflammatory and referred her to a 
rheumatologist. 
She was seen in the Rheumatology clinic, 6 months after her symptoms had begun. 
X-ray of her hands showed two erosions. A diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis was 
made based on clinical findings, positive rheumatoid factor and erosions. 
The presence of erosions and a strongly positive rheumatoid factor are poor 
prognostic factors, and her symptoms were not controlled on NSAIDs. She was 
commenced on methotrexate, an anti-rheumatic drug that reduces erosion formation. 
After six months on methotrexate, her symptoms continued to cause considerable 
discomfort and disability and an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody was commenced. 
After three infusions there was a dramatic improvement in pain and stiffness, and she 
was able to resume all normal activities. Acute phase markers returned to normal. 
She continues to get maintenance infusions of anti-TNF less frequently. Methotrexate 
was continued for its anti-rheumatic effect and to reduce the risk of developing 
anti-chimeric antibodies.

Connective Tissue Diseases 
The connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are chronic autoimmune conditions characterised by 
inflammation in blood vessels and connective tissues. CTDs are also known as collagen 
vascular disorders reflecting the prominence of vascular pathology and abnormal collagen 
deposition. The prototypic disease is SLE. Related disorders include polymyositis, systemic 
sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sj6gren’s syndrome and rheumatoid disease. 
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE) 
SLE is an immune complex (IC) mediated disease, which can affect any organ. Clinical 
presentations are protean, and patients may present to virtually any medical speciality. Skin- 
limited variants include discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus. A minor- 
ity of patients with apparently skin-limited disease ultimately progress to systemic disease. 
SLE affects up to 1: 1000 of the population, being more common in women than men 
(9 female: 1 male): Incidence peaks in the second/third decades as well as in later life. 
Concordance in monozygotic twins is 60% demonstrating a significant genetic influence. 
SLE is an IC deposition disease, where inflammation and ultimately organ dysfunction 
are due to deposition of ICs in the vasculature of affected organs. Patients produce an 
array of autoantibodies, including ANA, anti-dsDNA antibodies, ENA antibodies, and 
antibodies to blood cells. Type II hypersensitivity is involved in the immune-mediated 
cytopaenias, which are common. 
Clinical manifestations of SLE vary substantially between patients. Mildly affected patients 
may only have skin and joint disease, however, severe renal or cerebral disease can occur. SLE 
causes considerable morbidity and despite treatment continues to cause mortality. 
Common clinical features of SLE (Figure 2.23.1) include: 
¢ 
 Erythematous facial rash (butterfly rash) most prominent on the cheeks and bridge of 
the nose. 
¢ 
Chronic discoid plaque-like lesions.

Mouth ulcers and occasionally ulceration of nasal mucosa. 
The majority of patients are ANA and anti-dsDNA positive (if sensitive methods are used). 
Antibodies to the Sm (Smith) antigen are present in 30% of patients and are specific for 
SLE. Anti-Ro and occasionally anti-La are also found in a minority of patients with SLE. 
Approximately 30% of patients have antibodies to phospholipids, with detectable anti- 
cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant. Only some of these patients develop clinical 
features of the anti-phospholipid syndrome (pregnancy associated morbidity and/or 
vascular thrombosis). 
Disease activity in SLE is significantly affected by hormonal status. Women may 
experience flares during pregnancy or in the puerperium. Some women describe catamenial 
212 
CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES 
fluctuations in symptoms. Transplacental passage of antibodies, particularly anti-Ro 
antibodies, may result in neonatal lupus. Neonatal lupus causes skin lesions similar to 
discoid lupus in approximately half the infants. Congenital heart block is also a risk 
because Ro antibodies 
cross-react 
with tissue 
in the cardiac conducting bundle. 
Occasionally liver disease and thrombocytopaenia may also occur. Pregnancy may be 
complicated by miscarriage or preeclampsia in patients with associated anti-phospholipid 
syndrome (see Section 2.16). 
Drug-induced lupus may complicate the use of several drugs including salazopyrine, 
hydralazine, penicillamine, several anticonvulsants and etanerocept. Breaking self-tolerance 
due to presentation of altered self (drug interacts with self-antigen), is thought to be the 
mechanism involved. Drug-induced lupus is usually mild, generally resolving when the 
offending drug is stopped. 
Treatment of SLE depends on the severity of the disease. Skin lesions usually respond to 
topical steroids and hydroxychloroquine, and joint disease is treated with anti-inflamma- 
tory drugs and hydroxychloroquine. Serious systemic involvement requires steroid therapy 
usually with other immunosuppressive drugs that inhibit antibody formation. Anti- 
phospholipid syndrome associated with SLE is treated in the same way as primary 
anti-phospholipid syndrome, with aspirin or anti-coagulation. 
POLYMYOSITIS 
Polymyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease caused by damaging T cell responses to 
muscle antigens. Proximal muscles are prominently involved, becoming painful, tender and 
weak. Creatine kinase and aldolase (muscle enzymes) are markedly elevated together with 
an acute phase response. Approximately 30% of patients have anti-Jo-1 antibodies, which 
are associated with a syndrome comprising polymyositis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, interstitial 
lung disease and thickening of the fingers (“mechanics’ hands”). 
Dermatomyositis is a related condition where muscle inflammation is associated with 
skin lesions. The pathogenesis appears to be related to immune complex deposition in the 
vasculature of muscles resulting in muscle injury. Dermatomyositis and more rarely 
polymyositis may be associated with underlying malignancies. 
Anti-Jo-1 
associated 
polymyositis has not been associated with tumours to date. 
SCLERODERMA AND CREST 
Scleroderma (also called systemic sclerosis) is characterised by abnormal deposition of 
collagen in blood vessels and connective tissues. Skin involvement is prominent and skin 
thickening impairs mobility and function. Sclerodactyly (thickening of the skin on the fin- 
gers) and tightening of the mouth are common. Collagen deposition in the gastrointestinal 
tract, lungs and kidneys impair function. The diagnosis is predominantly clinical, however, 
anti-Scl-70 antibodies are present in 30% of patients. Anti-Scl-70 
is specific and is 
associated with a poor prognosis. 
CREST syndrome 
(Calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, oesophageal 
dysmotility, 
sclerodactyly and telangiectasia) is a mild variant of scleroderma usually without visceral 
involvement. Raynaud’s phenomenon may be troublesome and associated with digital 
ischaemia. Recently an association with pulmonary hypertension has been recognised, 
suggesting that this may not be as benign as previously thought. Centromere pattern ANA 
is characteristically found in this variant of systemic sclerosis. 
213 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE 
Features of different CTDs frequently overlap, and patients are often difficult to classify. 
Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a tightly defined overlap syndrome, combining 
features of SLE, polymyositis and scleroderma, and the presence of anti-RNP antibodies. 
Serious visceral involvement is rare, and the response to steroid therapy is usually good. 
SJOGREN’S SYNDROME 
214 
SjOgren’s syndrome (SS) is characterised by infiltration of glands and organs by autoreac- 
tive T cells. Lacrimal and salivary glands are typically destroyed, resulting in dry eyes and 
dry mouth (sicca syndrome). Patients may also develop arthritis, systemic symptoms, lung 
disease and vasculitis. Anti-Ro antibodies are present in up to 70% of patients and anti-La 
antibodies are less commonly found. Anti-salivary gland duct antibodies may also assist 
diagnosis. Patients with SS are at significant risk of developing lymphoma. While manifes- 
tations of the disease respond to steroids and immunosuppression, the latter increases the 
risk of lymphoma considerably.

Vasculitis 
Vasculitis means inflammation in the walls of blood vessels, disrupting the internal elastic 
lamina (Figure 2.24.1). The symptoms and signs of vasculitic disorders are due to gener- 
alised inflammation, and the consequences of vascular inflammation, causing dysfunction 
of organs supplied by vasculitic vessels. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the size 
of vessel involved and the type of inflammation. Vasculitis may result from Type III or Type 
IV hypersensitivity, however, in many clinical vasculitic syndromes the precise mechanism 
of vascular inflammation remains elusive. 
PRIMARY VERSUS SECONDARY VASCULITIS 
Vasculitis may be primary (with no recognised underlying cause) or secondary to many 
causes including: 
Drugs 
Infections 
Abnormal proteins (e.g. cryoglobulins) 
Other connective tissue diseases. 
¢*¢ 
¢ 
¢ 
Primary and some forms of secondary vasculitis are treated with immunosuppression. 
Secondary vasculitis, particularly due to underlying infection or drugs must be excluded 
prior to initiating immunosuppression. This section will focus on the primary vasculitides — 
some secondary vasculitides are discussed elsewhere in this book. 
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS 
Clinical features are due to widespread inflammation or direct consequences of vascular 
inflammation (Figure 2.24.2). Inflammation causes fatigue, weight loss, fever and raised 
inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR.

Vascular inflammation in large or medium vessels may result in vascular occlusion and 
dysfunction of organ(s) distal to the inflammation. In large vessel vasculitides; absent pulses 
or tenderness over involved vessels may occasionally be detected on physical examination. 
Vascular inflammation may weaken the vessel wall resulting in aneurysm formation. 
Inflammation in small vessels increases vessel permeability. In the lung this results in pul- 
monary haemorrhage; in the kidney severe glomerulonephritis resulting in haematuria, and 
in skin raised (palpable) purpura and/or bruising is typically seen. Skin, kidneys, lungs and 
joints are commonly affected, however, organ involvement varies between individual 
patients. 
Several classifications of the primary vasculitides have been proposed. A clinically use- 
ful scheme based on vessel size and the presence or absence of granulomata is shown in 
Table 2-24.1- 
i: 
For many patients a diagnosis of vasculitis leads to long-term immunosuppression, asso- 
ciated with considerable morbidity and even mortality. The gold standard diagnostic test 
remains histological demonstration of vasculitis. When this is not possible, angiographic 
evidence of aneurysm formation and beading of inflamed vessels, or occasionally positive 
serology may be the only possible diagnostic information. 
Until the late 1980s biopsy and angiography were the only methods available to diag- 
nose primary vasculitis. Recognition of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA, 
Section 3.5) was a major advance, providing a blood test which was positive in a large per- 
centage of patients with small vessel vasculitis and which varied with disease activity. 
However, as false positive ANCA occur, a positive ANCA is usually confirmed by biopsies 
of affected organ(s). ANCA have some pro-inflammatory effects and this may constitute a

VASCULITIS 
Case 2.24.1 Systemic vasculitis 
A 60-year-old woman presented with pain and numbness affecting her hands and feet 
which had developed gradually over the previous 3 weeks. In the last few days she 
had noticed increasing weakness in her hands, making normal daily activities 
difficult. She had been generally unwell in the preceding 6 months and had required 
medication for asthma for the last 10 years. Neurological examination suggested a 
mononeuritis multiplex. Bloods revealed anaemia and eosinophilia, an acute phase 
response and normal glucose. 
The neurologist suspected possible vasculitis because of the painful neuropathy and 
evidence of inflammation. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) was positive 
and follow-up 
testing demonstrated 
a strong 
proteinase 
3 (PR3)-ANCA. 
Electrophysiological testing confirmed a mononeuritis multiplex. A nerve biopsy 
showed demyelination and some axonal loss but did not establish a cause. However, 
a muscle biopsy performed simultaneously showed vasculitis, with abundant 
eosinophils in the inflammatory infiltrate and granulomata. The clinical picture of a 
vasculitic illness, history of asthma and eosinophilia, together with the biopsy findings 
established a diagnosis of Churg—Strauss syndrome, a vasculitis that predominantly 
affects medium-sized vessels. 
She was treated with cyclophosphamide and steroids and made an excellent 
recovery over the next two months. Following resolution of her symptoms and 
normalisation of the eosinophil count and acute phase markers, steroids were tapered 
and cyclophosphamide was changed to azathioprine, 
a weaker but less toxic 
immunosuppressive drug.

Hypersensitivity Induced by 
Pathogens 
The immune system evolved to protect us from pathogens. However, overzealous immune 
responses to pathogens result in tissue injury, contributing to the morbidity and even mor- 
tality associated with some infections. All types of hypersensitivity reaction can be induced 
by infection. Pathogen-induced hypersensitivity may be clinically apparent during infection 
or may follow recovery from the inciting infection. 
fm TYPE | HYPERSENSITIVITY 
Type I reactions protect against multicellular parasites, and when successful eliminate the 
parasites. However, when parasites are not eliminated, ongoing immune responses can 
cause tissue injury. Schistosomiasis is a water-borne infection occurring when schistosoma 
enter the body through breaches in skin. Adult worms migrate to the liver and lay eggs. 
Worms elicit IgE mediated responses, and the chronic response produces eosinophil- 
dominated inflammation. Eosinophils degranulate depositing toxic granule contents on the 
worm, usually killing the parasite. If unsuccessful, ongoing inflammation provokes scarring 
ultimately leading to cirrhosis and bladder disease. 
TYPE U HYPERSENSITIVITY: 
220 
Antibodies that bind tissue components and activate complement are implicated in rheumatic 
fever, a multisystem inflammatory disorder caused by strains of Group A B-haemolytic strep- 
tococci. Rheumatic fever is uncommon in the developed world due to improved living stan- 
dards and the availability of penicillin but remains important, from a global perspective. 
Several outbreaks have occurred in the United States in the last decade. 
Rheumatic 
fever occurs 
in genetically susceptible individuals, 
1-4 weeks after a 
streptococcal pharyngitis. Antibodies 
that bind some 
Streptococcal M_ proteins and 
cross-react with cardiac myosin have been found in some patients. Carditis, arthritis, chorea 
(involuntary rapid movements), rash, subcutaneous nodules and fever are clinical features. 
HYPERSENSITIVITY INDUCED BY PATHOGENS 
Diagnosis is primarily clinical, requiring the presence of two major criteria (carditis, 
polyarthritis, chorea, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum) or one major and two 
minor criteria (fever, arthralgia, prolonged PR interval on ECG, increased ESR or CRP) in 
a patient with evidence of recent streptococcal infection (culture or serological). 
Treatment includes antibiotics to eliminate residual infection, high-dose salicylates for 
fevers and arthritis, and steroids for cardiac and possibly neurological involvement. 
Supportive therapy for cardiac failure may be required. Recurrence of rheumatic fever is a 
risk, and secondary prophylaxis, with long-term antibiotic therapy to prevent streptococcal 
colonisation or infection is indicated. About 60% of patients who have had carditis develop 
valvular damage — rheumatic heart disease. These patients are at future risk of endocarditis. 
Other examples of infection induced Type II hypersensitivity include infection induced 
haemolytic anaemia, which can complicate Mycoplasma infection. 
LYPEALCHYPERSENSIFIVILY. 
Infection is associated with formation of immune complexes (ICs), however, physiological 
methods of IC disposal usually prevent IC disease. Infection-induced IC disease typically 
follows indolent chronic bacterial infections, which provoke a strong antibody response. 
Examples include vasculitis complicating subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), post- 
streptococcal glomerulonephritis, shunt nephritis and cryoglobulinaemia complicating 
hepatitis C infection. 
High-titre antibody combines with antigen from bacteria resulting in IC formation. 
When physiological disposal mechanisms are overwhelmed, ICs get trapped in blood 
vessels, commonly 
in the skin and kidneys. Complement activation and influx of 
inflammatory cells result in organ dysfunction. 
SBE 
is a chronic infection 
of heart valves, usually precipitated by episodes of 
bacteraemia in people with pre-existing valvular damage. Clinical manifestations are due 
to further valve damage (murmur and haemodynamic effects), effects of inflammation 
(APR, 
hypergammaglobulinaemia, 
fever 
and 
weight 
loss) 
and 
IC 
deposition. 
Manifestations attributable to ICs include splinter haemorrhages, nail-fold infarcts, Roth 
spots, skin rash and haematuria (due to mild glomerulonephritis). Diagnosis depends on 
identification of the organism in blood cultures or demonstration of vegetations (infected 
masses) on the heart valves at echocardiography. 
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can follow 2-4 weeks after streptococcal pharyngitis 
or skin infection. ICs deposited in the kidney activate complement, and on kidney biopsy, C3 
is usually the prominent immunoreactant. C3 levels are reduced and there is serological 
evidence of streptococcal infection (positive ASOT or anti-DNAase B). 
Infection of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (used to drain hydrocephalus) may be indolent, 
resulting in chronic immune stimulation and IC deposition usually causing skin rash 
(leucocytoclastic vasculitis) and nephritis. Treatment involves removal of the shunt and 
prolonged antibiotic therapy. 
TYPE IV HYPERSENSITIVITY 
Type IV hypersensitivity is characterised by macrophage activation by TH1 lymphocytes. 
When chronic, this can result in granuloma formation. This type of response protects 
against organisms that are phagocytosed by macrophages but capable of prolonged intra- 
cellular survival. This includes mycobacteria and some fungi. 
The clinical manifestations of leprosy vary greatly depending on the host’s immune response 
to the organism. Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which resist killing by 
macrophages, unless macrophages are activated by TH1 cells. Patients who produce a 
221 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
predominantly TH2 response develop an ineffective antibody-mediated response with poor cel- 
lular immunity. Mycobacteria proliferate and spread through the body, and biopsies of lesions 
show numerous mycobacteria with little inflammatory response. The patient remains highly 
infectious. At the other end of the spectrum, patients who produce a strong TH1-dominated 
response develop effective cell-mediated immunity, and lesions show granuloma formation and 
few mycobacteria — tuberculoid leprosy. These patients are minimally infective to others, how- 
ever, the granulomatous inflammation causes destruction of skin and peripheral nerves. Severe 
neuropathy results in progressive tissue damage particularly to the fingers and toes. Many 
patients have intermediate responses between these extremes. However, tuberculoid leprosy is 
an example of tissue destruction arising from a vigorous response to infection (Figure 2.25.1).

Transplantation 
In clinical practice, transplantation (or grafting) of bone marrow (or haemopoietic stem 
cells) as well as solid organs and tissues has become routine treatment. 
Transplantation may be: 
¢ 
Autologous — the individual’s own tissue, usually bone marrow or haemopoietic stem 
cells are returned to the body. 
¢ 
Syngeneic — tissue is transplanted from a genetically identical individual (identical 
twin). 
* 
Allogeneic — tissue is transplanted from a non-identical individual, from the same 
species. 
* 
Xenogeneic — tissue is transplanted from one species to another. 
Rejection is not a risk in autologous and syngeneic transplantation but is a major problem 
in allogeneic transplantation. Xenotransplantation carries a high risk of rejection, which 
together with concerns about infection have prevented clinical trials. 
~ WHAT IS TRANSPLANTED? 
Clinical transplantation may be divided into haemopoietic stem-cell (HSC) transplantation, 
solid organ transplantation and tissue transplantation. 
HSCs are progenitor cells that develop into the cellular elements of blood and the 
immune system. Until recently, bone marrow was the only viable source of HSCs, however, 
these cells are now harvested from peripheral blood after mobilisation by growth factors, 
and from umbilical cord blood. 
Solid organ transplantation is used to treat irreversible failure of kidneys, liver, heart, 
lung and pancreas. Small bowel transplantation remains experimental. 
Tissue transplantation refers to transplantation of non-vascularised tissues. The lack of 
blood-supply protects from rejection. However, when tissues expressing HLA-antigens are 
223 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
transplanted, sensitisation may result. Tissues routinely transplanted include cornea, bone 
and human and porcine heart valves. Islet cell transplantation has been successfully 
performed, and techniques are being refined. 
IMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS 
HSC transplantation replaces the bone marrow and immune system of the recipient. The 
recipient’s body is foreign to the new donor immune system, which may mount an attack 
on this ‘foreign’ tissue. This is termed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 
In solid organ transplantation, the donor organ is foreign to the recipient’s immune 
system. Rejection occurs when the recipient’s immune system attacks the transplanted 
organ. 
Non-vascularised tissue is generally not rejected, and systemic immunosuppression is 
not required. However, a corneal graft that becomes vascularised may be rejected.

INDICATIONS 
Pluripotential haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation refers to a range of procedures 
that restore haemopoietic function. Bone marrow, peripheral blood and umbilical cord 
blood are sources of HSCs. Indications for HSC grafting are many and include: 
* 
Haematological malignancies

nostic category or for relapsing disease 
Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (relapsed; high grade) multiple 
myeloma (young, poor prognosis) 
myeloid — acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) — (1st/2nd remission); chronic myeloid 
leukaemia. 
*

aplastic anaemia 
thalasaemias 
sickle-cell disease 
myelodysplasia.

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY

testis; ovary; Ewing’s sarcoma; neuroblastoma) 
¢ 
Autoimmune

(scleroderma etc.). 
TYPES OF TRANSPLANT 
Haemopoietic 
transplants 
are 
either autologous 
or 
allogeneic. Autologous HSC 
transplantation is relatively straightforward, however, allogeneic HSC transplantation is 
more challenging, and may be complicated by: 
¢ 
Non-engraftment (recipient rejects donors cells, which never ‘take’) 
¢ 
 Graft-versus-Host Disease. 
Autologous transplantation 
The use of auto-grafts is increasing because of the lack of rejection and GVHD complications 
as well as quicker marrow recovery. This type of transplant is suitable in: 
# 
Haematological malignancies — stem cells obtained during remission are used to restore 
marrow function following intensive, marrow-ablating chemotherapy. 
¢ 
Non-haematological malignancy - restoration of marrow function following ablative 
therapy. 
¢ 
Autoimmune disease — currently limited to clinical trials. 
Transplantation of residual tumour cells is a risk. Increasingly sensitive detection and 
eradication of minimal residual disease from stem cell preparations has increased success 
rates. 
Allogeneic transplantation 
226 
Allografts are used when there is an intrinsic fault in HSCs. 
¢ 
Congenital abnormalities 
- immunodeficiency, haemoglobinopathies and metabolic 
disorders (e.g. mucopolysaccharidoses). HSC transplantation is not used if the risks of 
the transplant procedure outweigh the benefit of correcting the underlying disease 
(e.g. X-linked agammaglobulinaemia). 
¢ 
Some haematological malignancies 
- 
for example, CML, myelodysplasia, 
aplastic 
anaemia. Immune non-identity may have some positive effects. Graft recognition and 
elimination of leukaemic cells (graft versus leukaemia effect), reduces relapse rate. 
While allogeneic transplants may offer cure (SCID) or improved outlook in very serious 
conditions (CML, aplastic anaemia), there are significant risks as outlined: 
¢ 
Rejection — failure of engraftment is more common than in autologous transplantation. 
¢ 
GvHD may be acute, occurring immediately post-transplant phase or chronic. Preventive 
measures include limitation of marrow mismatch, pre-treatment of stem cell transplant 
(T cell depletion) and immunosuppression of the host (Figure 2.27.1)

Adverse effects 
The following complications 
occur 
after 
both autologous 
and allogeneic HSC 
transplantation, but are more common and severe with allografts: 
5 
Severe marrow dysfunction, is more prolonged in allogeneic transplants, requiring 
intensive transfusion support and infection prevention measures (isolation, reverse- 
barrier nursing, antibiotic prophylaxis). Severe mucositis and alopoecia are almost 
inevitable. Bacterial, fungal, and certain viral infections occur frequently. CMV-negative 
donors are preferable and anti-viral prophylaxis is required if the donor was CMV- 
positive. 
Immunodeficiency is profound immediately post-transplant and some compromise is 
common for up to two years. In SCID, T cell restoration usually occurs, however, if B 
cells do not reconstitute long-term antibody support is required. Immune reconstitu- 
tion is delayed and deficient in patients with GvHD. 
Veno-occlusive disease — occurs with pre-existing liver disease, intensive conditioning, or 
if undergoing second transplant. 
227 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
¢ 
Secondary malignancies — skin; EBV-related lymphomas. 
¢ 
Endocrine — infertility. 
¢ 
Psychological — symptoms are common. 
Sources of HSCs 
Donors 
228 
HSCs are obtained from: 
¢ 
Bone marrow — aspirated under general anaesthetic, from puncture of the iliac crests. 
¢ 
Peripheral blood — a viable and convenient source of HSC, particularly with improved 
cell harvesting and separation techniques. Treating the donor with haemopoietic 
growth factors increases numbers of HSCs. The outcome post-grafting with PBSCs is 
often better than with bone marrow transplantation. 
¢ 
Cord blood — is a rich source of immature stem cells of limited immunogenicity. The 
number of cells that can be retrieved limits this application. 
All potential allogeneic donors must: 
* 
Give informed consent. 
Undergo screening for blood-borne infections. 
@ 
Undergo HLA typing - The ideal but rarely available donor is an HLA-matched 
sibling. HLA-matched unrelated donors (MUD transplants), usually identified from 
bone-marrow 
registries, 
are 
a less-favoured 
option. Haploid-identical matching 
(parental donors will share one HLA haplotype) has been successful in SCID, as 
rejection is not a problem. 
5 
Incompletely matched grafts can be assessed prior to transplantation for the likelihood of 
problems using a number of specialised immunological tests (mixed lymphocyte reaction, 
and precursor lymphocyte frequency measurement). 
In autologous transplantation, HSC must be harvested during clinical remission. 
Outlook for graft recipients is optimised by: 
¢ 
Appropriate pre-transplant conditioning (enough to eradicate diseased cells and to 
make enough physical space for the new bone marrow to develop) 
¢ 
Aggressive infection prophylaxis and treatment 
* 
Good supportive care. 
GvHD prophylaxis is given if there is a significant risk. The underlying condition also 
influences outcome. SCID patients generally do very well even with haploidentical donors. 
SCID patients are usually managed at specialist immunodeficiency transplant centres.

_ TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENT 
Patients are thoroughly assessed before going on the waiting list to ensure: 
* 
Medical and surgical fitness for transplantation 
¢ 
Psychologically suitable for surgery and post-transplantation therapy 
@ 
Understanding of the process and willingness to give informed consent. 
Laboratory assessment 
includes 
viral studies, blood grouping, HLA typing and 
identification of anti-HLA antibodies which could damage grafts. Anti-HLA antibodies 
develop when individuals are exposed to foreign HLA antigens. HLA sensitising events 
include pregnancy, blood transfusions and previous transplants. 
229 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
PREPARATION FOR TRANSPLANTATION 
The waiting time depends on the number of patients awaiting transplantation, clinical 
priority for the patient and the donor rate in the organ sharing area. Living-related (or 
unrelated) kidney transplantation may be considered, and is associated with superior out- 
comes for the recipient. Organ allocation policies vary between organs — size is a major 
determinant in thoracic transplantation, while HLA matching receives more attention in 
renal transplantation. A graft bearing HLA-antigens to which a patient has antibodies 
is not acceptable. Such anti-HLA antibodies will be identified at initial or ongoing 
assessments, well in advance of a donor becoming available. 
When a patient is considered for an organ, cross-matching is performed as a final check 
that the patient does not have anti-donor-HLA antibodies, which would cause hyperacute 
rejection. If cross-match results are acceptable, surgery may proceed. Every effort is 
made to minimise the ischaemic time of the organ. In the case of heart transplants accept- 
able ischaemia is limited to 4 hours, whereas kidneys can withstand over 24 hours in 
appropriate conditions. Longer ischaemia is associated with inferior outcomes. 
COMPLICATIONS 
Patients experience different complications at different times post transplantation. The 
prevalence of each complication depends on the organ transplanted and in some cases, the 
patient’s primary disease. Problems include: 
Surgical — bleeding, anastomotic leaks, wound infection 
Thrombosis of arteries and veins 
Rejection 
Infection 
Malignancy — post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD); skin cancers; 
other tumours 
¢ 
Drug toxicity — steroid-induced osteoporosis; hirsutism and gingival hypertropy with 
cyclosporin 
* 
Recurrence of primary disease in transplanted organ 
* 
Rejection is a common occurrence following transplantation as the immune system 
attacks the graft (non-self). 
¢-¢¢ 
6 
¢ 
REJECTION: WHAT MOLECULES DOES THE 
IMMUNE SYSTEM SEE? 
230 
« 
The immune system responds to molecules that differ between the donor and recipient. 
These may be divided into: 
* 
Major antigens 
- HLA (MHC) antigens, which are recognised by the immune system 
without processing, and elicit strong cellular and antibody responses. Routine typing 
and cross-matching usually identifies these antigens. 
* 
Minor antigens — numerous molecules, not identified by tissue typing techniques. 
Minor antigens require processing, and are presented to the recipient’s immune system 
complexed with recipient HLA molecules (indirect presentation). They elicit T cell 
responses, weaker than those elicited by HLA molecules. 
SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION 
Classification of rejection 
Classification of rejection is based on the mechanism of tissue damage — different types being 
common at different times post transplantation (Table 2.28.1). 
Mechanisms of graft damage 
ANTIBODY-MEDIATED REJECTION 
Binding of antibody results in complement activation and deposition of the membrane 
attack complex (MAC). Graft endothelium becomes damaged, and the coagulation cascade 
is activated. Biopsy shows thrombi, neutrophil infiltration and severe tissue injury. DIF 
demonstrates deposition of antibody and complement. Anti-donor antibody is frequently 
detectable in the serum. Antibody mediated rejection occurs in about 1% of renal trans- 
plant recipients. 
T CELL-MEDIATED REJECTION 
Acute cellular rejection 
T cells infiltrate the graft interstitium and renal tubules. 
Cytotoxic T cells directly injure the allograft, and cytokines produced by helper and cyto- 
toxic T cells attract more inflammatory cells and up-regulate HLA antigen expression thus 
amplifying the process (Figure 2.28.1). Cellular rejection is seen in about 20% of renal 
allograft recipients. 
Chronic rejection 
The mechanisms of chronic rejection are poorly understood. It appears 
that early damage to the graft (due to rejection, reperfusion injury, cytomegalovirus) initiates 
an inflammatory process leading to scarring and tissue remodelling. Virtually all long-surviv- 
ing solid organ grafts show evidence of chronic rejection. 
Episodes of rejection are 
a common complication, 
even with modern immuno- 
suppression, in recipients of all solid organs. 
The risk can be reduced by: 
¢ 
Optimal HLA matching (however, not possible for patients with rare HLA types) 
Improved cross matching (reducing antibody-mediated rejection) 
¢ 
More potent immunosuppression 
(but also increases 
the risk of infection and 
malignancy).

SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION 
Case 2.28.1 Renal transplantation 
A 25-year-old woman complained of ankle swelling, facial swelling in the mornings and 
weight gain of 4 kg. She had been generally unwell for the preceding two months, and 
also had joint pains and stiffness. On examination, blood pressure was elevated 
(170/100 mm/Hg), there was synovitis affecting small joints in her hands, pitting 
oedema to the midcalf and urinalysis showed large amounts of protein and blood in her 
urine. The GP suspected glomerulonephritis, possibly related to systemic lupus 
erthematosus (SLE) and arranged for urgent admission. 
Anti-nuclear 
antibody 
and 
anti-double 
stranded DNA 
were 
strongly 
positive. C3 and C4 were undetectable, ESR was7>100 mm/hour, albumin was 
low (20 g/l) and urinary protein was 5 g/24 hours: Renal biopsy showed 
a 
membranoproliferative pattern of injury with glomerular deposits of C3, C4, IgA, 
IgG and IgM. Creatinine had risen to 500 pmol/l. A diagnosis of SLE with active, 
severe nephritis was made. 
She was immediately treated with high dose intravenous methylprednisolone and 
monthly pulses of cyclophosphamide, and her disease became less active over the 
ensuing months. She required dialysis for a short period, but renal function improved 
and she became dialysis independent with a creatinine of 200 pmol/l. Unfortunately 
5 years later, despite good control of the SLE her creatinine began to climb. Repeat 
biopsy showed extensive scarring without significant active inflammation. Once more 
she became dialysis dependent, and was listed for a cadaveric renal transplant. 
After waiting for 2 years she received a renal transplant. The kidney functioned 
immediately and she was maintained on tacrolimus, azathioprine and corticosteroids. She 
remains well 5 years post transplant with normal renal function. As with many SLE 
patients her disease has remained quiescent since her transplant, as post-transplant 
immunosuppression is usually more than adequate to control SLE.

Lymphoid Malignancies 
— OVERVIEW 
234 
These are a diverse group of conditions, arising from malignant transformation of a single 
(monoclonal) lymphocyte population. B cell malignancies are more common (80% +), with 
most others being of T cell lineage. NK cell malignancies are very rare. Malignant 
transformation results in arrest of development and uncontrolled proliferation or persist- 
ence of a monoclonal lymphoid population. This can occur at any stage of maturation or 
activation. The microscopic appearance, pattern of CD— and antigen receptor molecule 
expression, distribution within the lymphoid system, and behaviour of malignant lympho- 
cytes is highly variable, depending on the developmental or activation stage from which 
they originate (Figure 2.29.1). Malignant lymphocytes closely mirror the features of normal 
lymphocytes at similar stages of differentiation. 
Lymphoid malignancies are sub-divided into: 
¢ 
Leukaemia — malignant proliferation originates and accumulates in the bone marrow, 
usually with peripheral blood involvement. 
# 
Lymphoma - focussed in tissues of the secondary immune system — lymph nodes, liver, 
spleen, MALT. Bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement may occur. 
The incidence 
of lymphoid malignancies 
of all types approximates 25/100,000 
population per year. Patients of all ages are affected. Distinct age profiles are seen in some 
conditions. ALL occurs in children predominantly. It accounts for a third of all malignan- 
cies in this age group. In contrast, chronic leukaemias (e.g. CLL) and plasma cell malig- 
nancies are rare before the age of 40 years and increase in prevalence with increasing age. 
Incidence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma peaks in young adulthood with a further peak in later 
life. The incidence of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) has increased dramatically in recent 
decades.

CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS 
Clinical presentations distinct to particular conditions will be discussed in Section 2.30. 
Generally, clinical manifestations of lymphoid malignancies are due to: 
4 
Accumulation of malignant cells — enlargement of lymphoreticular organs, especially 
in lymphomas. Thymic involvement in some T cell leukaemias. Extranodal masses 
occur anywhere, especially in the gut, brain and skin. 
Suppression of non-malignant blood cell lines — anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and 
neutropaenia. 
Immune dysregulation — antibody immunodeficiency in plasma cell malignancies; cell- 
mediated abnormalities in Hodgkin’s disease; production of autoantibodies causing 
several complications, 
for example, haemolytic anaemia and immune thrombo- 
cytopaenia in CLL, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency in NHL. 
FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES 
The pathogenesis of some specific lymphoid malignancies has been elucidated. However, 
aetiology is usually complex and probably multifactorial. Causative factors include: 
Genetic 
There is an increased incidence in: 
¢$¢¢ 
¢ 
Microbial 
5 
Identical twin of patient with leukaemia. 
Down’s syndrome. 
Fanconi anaemia. 
Specific genetic translocations, often involving oncogenes/antigen receptors — t8:14 (c- 
myc/IgH) 
in Burkitt’s lymphoma; t14:18 
(IgH/bcl-2) 
in follicular lymphoma; 
Philadelphia chromosome/t9:22 (ber/c-abl fusion) in CML and in bad prognosis ALL. 
Other cytogenetic variations, for example, hyperploidy (too many chromosomes) or 
deletions aie also seen. 
EBV is a causative factor in Burkitt’s lymphoma. EBV is also implicated in diffuse large 
B cell lymphoma associated with immunodeficiency (e.g. post-transplant), in CNS 
lymphoma affecting HIV positive patients and in Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 
Lymphomas occur with increased frequency in patients with advanced HIV infection. 
EBV-related CNS lymphoma and Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)-related extranodal 
lymphomas are well-recognised. 
HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus implicated in an aggressive adult-onset T cell leukaemia 
endemic in the Caribbean and Japan. 
Helicobacter pylori is associated with MALToma involving the gastric mucosa. 
Immunodeficiency 
5 
236 
Virus-driven NHLs are seen in secondary immunodeficiency states like HIV infection 
and in the setting of post-transplant immunosuppression. 
Others 
LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES 
Lymphoma occurs with increased frequency in patients with primary immunodeficiencies, 
possibly due to susceptibility to lymphoma-triggering infections. This risk is especially 
pronounced in X-linked lymphoproliferative 
disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 
CVID, Chediak—Higashi syndrome and in disorders of DNA repair. 
Radiation exposure 
(e.g. Hiroshima, Chernobyl, extensive radiological exposure); 
chemicals (benzene); cytotoxic drugs; chronic immune stimulation/dysregulation, for 
example, in connective tissue diseases and coeliac disease, are all possible factors.

Leukaemia and Lymphoma 
CLASSIFICATION 
238 
Neoplastic blood cell proliferations are classified into three groups: 
¢ 
Lymphoid - B, T, or NK cell origins 
¢ 
Myeloid - granulocyte, monocyte, red blood cell, platelet origins 
@ 
 Histiocytic — dendritic cell origin. 
Haematological malignancies are classified as leukaemias or lymphomas. Lymphomas are 
further sub-divided into: 
@ 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma — HD — a condition with distinct histological and clinical features 
¢ 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) comprise all other forms. 
Acute leukaemias originate from immature/precursor cells. Chronic leukaemias arise 
from mature populations. Lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias 
are described. Acute 
leukaemias develop and manifest quickly and survival without therapy is short. Chronic 
leukaemias 
are slow growing, survival may be prolonged, and many are clinically 
silent. Transformation to more active disease occurs with varying frequency in different 
chronic leukaemias. Classification of lymphoid neoplasms is complex and many different 
systems are described. The Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) classification 
is the most widely used. Both leukaemias and lymphomas of lymphocytic origin are 
included. 
Myeloid counterparts of lymphomas are not described. Enlargement of lymphoreticular 
organs may occur, either due to deposition of myeloid malignant cells or as a result of 
blood 
cell 
production 
occurring 
outside 
the 
bone 
marrow 
(extramedullary 
haematopoiesis). Histiocytic conditions are rare. They typically involve extramedullary 
tissues. 
LEUKAEMIA AND LYMPHOMA 
ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKAEMIA (ALL) 
ALL arises from malignant transformation of bone marrow immature lymphoblasts. Four 
types are categorised using immunophenotyping techniques:

Bis). 
¢ 
ell’

Subdivision according to cell size and variability (FAB classification) is also used and has 
prognostic implications. 
ALL is the single commonest childhood malignancy. Adults are less frequently affected. 
Onset is usually sudden and florid. 
Clinical features include: 
Bone marrow failure 
Bone pain/tenderness 
CNS — meningism, nerve palsies 
Lymphadenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly 
Testicular enlargement 
Thymic enlargement with SVC obstruction (T-ALL, older boys). 
¢-¢% 
© 
ALL is highly sensitive to chemotherapy; >90% achieve complete remission and 70% are 
cured. Presentation in the first year of life or in adolescence and adulthood, or Philadelphia 
chromosome positivity are poor prognostic indicators. BMT during first remission in these 
groups may offer a better outlook. 
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKAEMIA (CLL) AND VARIANTS 
CLL is the most common adult leukaemia and represents malignant transformation in 
a mature B cell population. It predominantly affects the elderly. Presentations include: 
Coincidental 
Lymphadenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly 
Constitutional upset 
Marrow failure 
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia/thrombocytopaenia 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia with recurrent bacterial infections.

into more 
aggressive 
states 
including 
prolymphocytic leukaemia or diffuse large cell lymphoma (Richter’s syndrome) following 
which survival is decreased. 
Other mature leukaemias similar to CLL are: 
¢ 
Prolymphocytic leukaemia 
— 
more 
aggressive. Major lymphocytosis, anaemia, 
thrombocytopaenia, massive splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms are typical. 
239 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Case 2.30.1 Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
A 55-year-old woman complained of bruising and nose bleeds. She had been 
unusually fatigued for the last 6 months. Her GP checked a full blood count, which 
showed a lymphocytosis of 6 X 107/l and thrombocytopaenia, with a platelet count 
of 35 X 10°/l. She was referred to the haematology clinic, where these initial findings 
were confirmed. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood showed an excess of 
CD5+ CD19+ B cells, the typical phenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL). Bone marrow examination revealed an excess of B cells, as well as increased 
numbers of megakaryocytes (platelet precursors), which suggested that the low 
platelet count was due to excessive destruction in the periphery. She had no lym- 
phadenopathy, and liver and spleen size were normal clinically, however, mild 
splenomegaly was detected radiologically. Anti-platelet antibodies were positive. 
A diagnosis of CLL complicated by immune thrombocytopaenia was made. 
Initial treatment with steroids improved her platelet count to between 90 and 
100 X 107/l. As the lymphocyte count was stable, no treatment was required for the 
CLL, which frequently runs an indolent course. One year later, the patient was 
admitted with a severe pneumonia. In the preceding 6 months she had required 
monthly antibiotics for bacterial infections. Immunoglobulin (Ig) measurement showed 
a low IgG at 4 g/l (Ref 6-13 g/l), undetectable IgA and normal IgM. Test vaccination 
with Pneumovax II showed low prevaccination level, with no response to vaccination. 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia secondary to CLL is common, and contributes to the 
morbidity and mortality of the condition. The patient was commenced on intravenous 
Ig replacement therapy. Over the next two years she only required antibiotics twice per 
year, and her lymphocyte count remains stable.

Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy 
Characteristic cell morphology is diagnostic. Combination chemotherapy or the newer 
CLL therapies may be of benefit. 
¢ 
Hairy cell leukaemia 
- 
usually indolent condition 
with characteristic 
‘hairy’ 
appearance of malignant cells. Usually affects older males. Massive splenomegaly and 
pancytopaenia are typical. Symptomatic disease is exquisitely sensitive to purine 
analogues and IFN-y treatment. 
¢ 
Splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) - is indolent. Splenomegaly and 
constitutional upset are common. Distinct morphology and immunophenotype and 
minimal marrow involvement characterise SLVL. Treatment 
is similar 
to CLL. 
Splenectomy may be required. 
HODGKINS’S DISEASE 
This isa common malignancy in young adults particularly affecting male Caucasians from 
high socio-economic 
groupings. EBV 
is probably involved 
in pathogenesis. The 
240 
LEUKAEMIA AND LYMPHOMA 
Reed-Sternberg 
cell, with distinctive 
histological and immunophenotypic 
features 
(binucleate large cell with prominent nucleoli), 
is essential for diagnosis. Different 
sub-classes are defined according to the relationship of Reed-Sternberg cells to other white 
cell populations and to patterns of fibrosis within the affected tissues. The histological 
pattern influences prognosis. 
Presenting features of HD are: 
¢ 
Painless lymphadenopathy 
—- superficial, supra-diaphragmatic. Internal nodes may 
cause compressive effects. Direct spread along chains of nodes is typical. 
¢ 
Constitutional upset — ‘B symptoms’. Fever, night sweats, weight loss, alcohol-related 
lymph node pain highly suggestive. 
Stage of disease partly predicts outcome. This is established on the basis of the extent of 
lymph node involvement and presence or absence of ‘B’“symptoms. Radiotherapy may 
adequately treat localised disease. More extensive disease requires chemotherapy. Outlook 
is good even in the latter group. Myeloid leukaemias, other malignancies and lung damage 
are complications of therapy. 
NON-HODGKIN‘’S LYMPHOMAS (NHLs) 
NHLs vary from low-grade, indolent lymphoid expansions through to aggressive disease, 
which may be fatal. NHLs are dramatically increasing in frequency throughout the Western 
world. Response to therapy is not as successful as with HD. 
Distinct entities are described according to: 
@ 
Developmental stage from which the malignant clone originates (e.g. lymphoblastic, 
follicular, small mature lymphocytic, diffuse large B cell, plasma cell) 
¢ 
Type of lymphocyte (B, T, NK) 
Cytogenetic and other molecular mutation patterns 
¢ 
Clinical features, for example, aggressive (high-grade), indolent (low-grade), location (nodal, 
extranodal), 
associated 
features 
(hyperviscosity, splenomegaly, 
skin involvement, 
immune dysfunction). 
Sa 
Clinically, grade (rate of proliferation) 
is the most important prognostic 
factor. 
Approximately 1/3 of cases are high-grade, diffuse large B cell, a further 1/3 are follicular 
B cell and the remainder are varied in origin. NHLs are typically more widespread than HD 
at presentation. 
As with CLL, many low-grade lymphomas may not require immediate therapy. Indications 
for therapy include systemic symptoms, symptomatic lymphadenopathy and bone marrow 
failure. Survival may be prolonged even in the absence of therapy, but cure is rare. In contrast, 
patients with high-grade NHLs require immediate chemotherapy. Initial response rates are 
high, but relapse is common and outlook poor if this occurs. BMT may be indicated in some 
cases. Radiotherapy 
is beneficial in distinct disorders, for example, CNS lymphoma. 
Antibiotic therapy is potentially curative in Helicobacter — related MALToma.

Plasma Cell Diseases 
Plasma cell diseases (dyscrasias) comprise several conditions of varying clinical presentation 
and severity characterised by monoclonal plasma cell proliferation. The intensity and dis- 
semination of plasma cell expansion, amount and type of the monoclonal immunoglobulin 
secreted, and associated systemic features (e.g. renal failure, hypercalcaemia, hyperviscos- 
ity) are important in classification. Conditions associated with paraprotein production are 
also called gammopathies. 
MULTIPLE MYELOMA 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the commonest malignant disorder of plasma cells and 
accounts for 1% of all malignancies in Caucasians, usually occurring after 50 years. 
The cause of MM is unknown, but autocrine secretion of IL-6 may play a role. 
Disseminated monoclonal expansion of paraprotein-secreting plasma cells in the 
bone marrow is the hallmark of the disease. The paraprotein is IgG in 60% of cases, 
IgA in 20%, and light chains alone in 15-20%. Rare cases are IgD- or IgE-secreting, 
occasionally non-secreting, 
or biclonal (two different paraproteins). True IZM MM 
is rare. 
« 
Diagnosis 
242 
At least two of the following criteria must be present to make a diagnosis of MM: 
* 
Increased percentage of abnormal looking bone marrow plasma cells (>20% of 
nucleated cells or 12% if monoclonality confirmed) 
¢ 
Paraprotein in blood and/or urine. Suppression of non-myeloma immunoglobulins 
is common 
* 
Bone destruction with osteoporosis or lytic lesions. 
PLASMA CELL DISEASES 
Clinical presentation 
The major clinical features of MM are: 
4 
Bone disease — found in 70% of cases at presentation. Bone breakdown activated by 
IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-a (osteoclast activating factors) is exaggerated. Osteoporosis and 
punched-out lytic lesions affecting the skull and axial skeleton are commonly seen on 
X-ray. Back pain is common. Myeloma screening is indicated in unexplained back pain 
over 40 years. Spinal cord compression is a dangerous complication. Pain at other sites 
and pathological fractures occur. Extensive bone breakdown leads to hypercalcaemia. 
Classically, the alkaline phosphatase level is normal even when significant bone 
involvement is present. 
Renal impairment is present in 25% at presentation, developing in 50% at some stage. 
The mechanisms are multiple. Hypercalcaemia and dehydration are important poten- 
tially reversible causes. Increased light-chain excretion can cause renal tubular obstruc- 
tion leading to atrophy and necrosis with renal failure. Forced diuresis and treatment 
of the underlying myeloma can rarely improve renal function. Renal amyloidosis, and 
renal vein thrombosis are other causes of renal impairment. 
Haematological — anaemia is common and dominates presentation in 20% of cases. 
Causes include marrow failure, and renal impairment. Full-blown marrow failure more 
often complicates intensive therapies. Hypergammaglobulinaemia (paraprotein) and 
anaemia may greatly elevate the ESR (>100 mm/hour). Large paraprotein concentra- 
tions, especially IgA and IgG3 may cause hyperviscosity. Coagulopathy occurs in a 
small number of cases. 
Immunological — Suppression of non-paraprotein immunoglobulins (immunoparesis) 
and functional antibody deficiency, predisposing to pyogenic infections is common. 
10% of patients present with bacterial infection (most often pneumococcal). Infection 
is also a common cause of death. 
Prognosis and monitoring 
MM is a serious condition. Death occurs within a year in most untreated cases and with 
treatment the 5-year mortality rate is 75%. 
¢-¢¢ 
¢ 
OOO 
Poor prognostic features include: 
Anaemia (<8.5 g/dl)* 
Hypercalcaemia (>3.0 mmol/I)* 
Widespread bone disease* 
High levels of paraprotein (IgG > 70 g/l; IgA > 50 g/l; BJP > 12 g/24 hours)* 
Renal impairment 
High % of plasma cells, circulating cells; abnormal plasma cell morphology 
High B>-microglobulin 
High IL-6 (CRP surrogate marker). 
Prognosis is related to the tumour mass, calculated from the asterisked parameters 
(Durie-Salmon staging system - 
‘0’ — indolent 
— 
III - advanced). Alternatively, B»- 
microglobulin (corrected for serum creatinine) and CRP can be used, with poorest outlook 
when both parameters are elevated. Monitoring of MM includes serial measurement of the 
above parameters. Occasionally patients meeting diagnostic criteria for MM (excess plasma 
cells and paraprotein) have a small tumour burden, normal haematological, biochemical 
243 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
and bone indices with stable paraprotein levels. Such cases are called smouldering or 
indolent myeloma and do not require immediate treatment. Monitoring for progression is 
important. 
Management 
MM is rarely curable. Therapy aims to reduce tumour burden to a plateau level with stable 
haematological and biochemical parameters and bone lesions. Relapse and progression is 
inevitable in most cases. 
The principle points of management are: 
* 
Good Supportive Management — analgesia for bone pain; radiotherapy for localised 
bone pain; re-hydration, loop diuretics and bisphosphonates 
for correction 
of 
hypercalcaemia; rehydration and renal replacement therapy in renal impairment; anti- 
biotic treatment of infection; antibiotic prophylaxis or Ig replacement therapy in 
functional antibody deficiency; blood transfusion for anaemia; plasma exchange for 
hyperviscosity. 
¢ 
Standard Therapy — cyclical melphalan and prednisolone administered monthly until 
plateau is achieved. 
¢ 
Newer approaches — more intensive chemotherapy (e.g. VAD) induce plateau phase 
more rapidly, but are more toxic. Rapid response is of benefit in bone marrow failure and 
renal disease, however, benefit in other situations is less clear cut. 
# 
Marrow ablation and HSC transplantation is still being evaluated and is an option for 
young patients. IFN-a can prolong the plateau phase but does not improve overall 
survival. Bisphosphonates reduce progression of bone disease. 
OTHER PLASMA CELL DISEASES 
244 
Plasmacytoma is a single, localised deposit of monoclonal plasma cells, usually in bone, 
causing localised pain. Paraproteins are detected in about 50% of cases. Local radiotherapy 
is effective in controlling symptoms. Monitoring is important as 50% advance to MM. 
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia occurs mainly in patients over 50 years and is 
relatively benign. The paraprotein is of IgM isotype and may cause hyperviscosity. 
Proliferative, invasive and dysfunctional characteristics of malignant plasma cells are rare. 
The malignant cell is of lymphoplasmacytoid morphology. Mild anaemia and ESR 
> 100 mm/hour are common. Moderate lymphoid enlargement is also seen. Renal involve- 
ment and amyloidosis is rare. Bone involvement does not occur. Hyperviscosity symptoms 
usually appear at serum viscosity levels >4 (IgM usually >40 g/l) but individual sensitivity 
to rises in viscosity varies. 
Symptoms of hyperviscosity include: 
* 
Headaches, confusion; light-headedness — impaired cerebral circulation 
¢ 
Acute 
deterioration 
in eyesight 
— 
blood 
vessel 
tortuosity, 
dilations, 
retinal 
haemorrhages 
* 
Nose bleeds and easy bruising. 
Immediate reduction in the serum viscosity by plasmapheresis is indicated in symptomatic 
patients, especially if visual acuity is impaired. Plasmapheresis is continued until symptoms 
resolve and serum viscosity improves following which maintenance plasmapheresis is 
provided at intervals. Chemotherapy similar to that used in CLL is indicated if viscosity or 
PLASMA CELL DISEASES 
systemic features are difficult to control. Occasional cases are aggressive with major 
lymphoid enlargement and marrow failure requiring more intensive therapy. Outlook is 
poor in such cases. 
Other rare plasma cell disorders include: 
Heavy-chain diseases — rare conditions in which monoclonal plasma cells produce 
incomplete heavy chain. IgA heavy-chain disease is most common, with IgA-producing 
plasma 
cell proliferation 
in gut mucosa 
and presenting 
features 
of diarrhoea, 
malabsorption, and weight loss. Transition to an aggressive lymphoma may occur. Other 
heavy-chain diseases are extremely rare and present like NHL. 
Primary amyloidosis 
— monoclonal 
light chains deposit 
as amyloidosis 
usually 
complicating MM. 
Renal, 
neurological 
and 
cardiac’ 
dysfunctions 
are common. 
Occasionally MM is not present. 
Paraprotein-associated neurological syndromes — 
these include paraprotein-associated 
neuropathy with a peripheral demyelinating neuropathy caused by paraprotein, usually of 
IgM isotype, specific for myelin-associated glycolipids. Low-grade B cell neoplasms are 
sometimes identified. Plasmapheresis and chemotherapy for underlying lymphoprolifera- 
tion may be useful. POEMS is a syndrome characterised by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, 
Case 2.31.1 Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance 
A 60-year-old man presented with tingling and numbness in his fingers and toes, in 
a glove and stocking distribution. Investigations for causes of neuropathy showed 
that he had non-insulin dependent diabetes, and this was felt to be the cause of his 
symptoms. However, an additional incidental finding was of an IgM Kappa mono- 
clonal band on serum electrophoresis. 
Further investigation showed that the paraprotein was present in small quantities 
(4 g/l) and there was no immune paresis detectable. Urine electrophoresis showed 
only a trace of albuminuria, and no paraprotein or Bence—Jones proteins. Serum cal- 
cium was normal, as was alkaline phosphatase and skeletal survey was normal. Bone 
marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy were within normal limits — specifically there 
was no increase in plasma cells. There was no clinical or radiological evidence of lym- 
phadenopathy. Following exclusion of multiple myeloma and detectable lymphopro- 
liferative disease, a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance 
was made. 
The patient remained well and was followed up regularly in the haematology clinic, 
with regular monitoring of the amount of paraprotein and By-microglobulin. Eight years 
after presentation the amount of paraprotein detected at a routine visit had doubled. 
Full workup did not reveal evidence of myeloma. However, the paraprotein level con- 
tinued to rise, and one year later Bence—Jones proteins became detectable in the urine. 
Repeat bone marrow showed an excess of plasma cells. In view of progression of 
monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance to myeloma, the patient was com- 
menced on chemotherapy.

MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY OF UNCERTAIN 
SIGNIFICANCE 
246 
Detection of paraprotein in serum becomes increasingly prevalent with age. In some healthy, 
asymptomatic patients, paraproteins are identified coincidentally and no underlying causes 
are found despite careful investigation. This is monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signifi- 
cance (MGUS) — a diagnosis of exclusion. This is a common problem occurring in 1% of 50 
year-olds, 3% of 70 year-olds and 10% of 80 year-olds. 
Typical features in MGUS are: 
Lower paraprotein level than in malignant conditions (usually <10 g/l) 
Bence—Jones protein rare (<5%) 
Marrow plasma cell percentage is <10% 
Immunoparesis is rare 
Other laboratory and radiological investigations are normal (myeloma screen) 
No evidence of other paraprotein-related disorder. 
¢¢¢

OO 
The previous term used for this condition — Benign Monoclonal Gammopathy - is not 
accurate. On long-term follow-up, about 20% of these patients evolve into true MM. 
On-going clinical and laboratory monitoring is essential. This should be done on a 
3-6 month basis indefinitely in all cases.

Genetic factors are more important than environmental factors in explaining the recent rise 
in atopic disease. 
In utero the immune system is biased towards producing TH2 type responses. 
In the absence of a history of atopy in one or other parent, a child is unlikely to develop atopy. 
Overuse of sympathomimetic decongestants can cause a type of chronic rhinitis. 
SPTs are commonly positive in children with atopic dermatitis and are reliable predictors of 
clinical response to allergen avoidance. 
Aspirin-sensitive asthma is commonly associated with nasal polyps. 
Long-term treatment of asthma is aimed at relaxing bronchial smooth muscle. 
Cough in the absence of wheeze is a well-recognised presentation of asthma. 
Histamine is the prominent mediator of the late phase of the allergic response. 
In the asthmatic airway the number of ciliated cells is increased. 
C1 Inhibitor deficiency may present with crampy abdominal pain, caused by mucosal 
oedema. 
Aspirin sensitivity causes urticaria and angioedema through an IgE-mediated mechanism. 
Chronic urticaria is rarely due to food allergy, and routine allergy assessment of patients is 
generally unhelpful. 
Thyroid disease can present with chronic urticaria. 
Individual lesions in acute allergic urticaria last for more than 24 hours and resolve with 
bruising. 
Anaphylaxis can be differentiated from anaphylactoid reactions on clinical grounds. 
Elevation of mast cell tryptase proves that mast cell degranulation has occurred, and differ- 
entiates anaphylactic reaction to an anaesthetic drug from other anaesthetic accidents. 
Infection, alcohol and exercise can all exacerbate allergic reactions. 
Beta-blockers can safely be used in patients with severe allergies. 
Asthma must be well controlled in patients at risk of an anaphylactic reaction. 
Severe antibody deficiencies present in the first few weeks after birth. 
Recurrent bacterial infection is the most common presentation of hypogammaglobulinaemia. 
All types of hypogammaglobulinaemia may be associated with granulomatous inflammation in 
lungs and lymphoid tissues. 
Antibody deficiencies that require replacement therapy present in childhood. 
Full assessment of humoral immunity should be performed in patients with bronchiectasis. 
Patients with SCID rarely require intravenous immunoglobulin. 
Transfusion associated GvHD is a life-threatening complication of SCID, which can be 
prevented by using irradiated blood products. 
Vaccination should proceed according to schedule unless a definitive diagnosis of SCID is 
established. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is indicated in SCID. 
Lymphopaenia is usually present in SCID.

Severe gum disease may indicate defects of neutrophil function. 
The most common neutrophil disorder is primary neutropaenia. 
Delayed separation of the umbilical cord due to a defective inflammatory response may be the 
first sign of leucocyte adhesion defects. 
Neutrophil function testing is unnecessary if there are normal numbers of morphologically 
normal neutrophils. 
Prophylactic antibiotics are useful in patients with defective neutrophil function. 
C1 Inhibitor deficiency is associated with pyogenic infections and immune complex disease. 
C3 deficiency is the most severe type of complement deficiency. 
C2 deficiency is the most common complete complement component deficiency in Causacians. 
Complement deficiency is unlikely if C3 and C4 levels are normal. 
Patients with deficiencies of terminal attack complex components are particularly susceptible 
to meningococcal infections. 
Hyposplenism due to sickle-cell anaemia is associated with a high incidence of salmonella 
infection. 
If vaccination cannot be performed pre-splenectomy it should be deferred for at least 6 weeks. 
Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection rarely occurs in patients under S years of age. 
Howell-Jolly bodies are composed of denatured DNA and are detected on a routine full blood 
count. 
Vaccination against pneumococci is effective lifelong post splenectomy. 
HIV infection can be reliably diagnosed using antibody-based tests within 1 month of 
infection. 
Chemoprophylaxis against PCP should be initiated as soon as HIV infection is diagnosed. 
Anti-retroviral therapy during pregnancy greatly reduces the risk of vertical transmission from 
a HIV infected mother to their child. 
HIV rarely mutates — therefore patients who respond to HAART tend to remain responsive. 
Heterosexual transmission of HIV is rare. 
In Hashimoto’s thyroiditis the presence of autoantibodies indicate that the disease is mediated 
by humoral immune mechanisms. 
Immunosuppression may be required for severe eye involvement in Grave’s disease. 
Strongly positive anti-thyroid antibodies in a patient with a thyroid nodule reliably excludes 
thyroid cancer. 
IDDM is associated with coeliac disease, and all patients should be screened for anti-endomysial 
antibody.

Addison’s disease is frequently the presenting feature of an autoimmune polyglandular 
syndrome. 
Diagnosis of ITP requires demonstration of antiplatelet antibodies. 
Haemolytic disease of the newborn can be fatal and once maternal sensitisation has occurred 
future pregnancies are extremely difficult to manage. 
Drug-induced haemolytic anaemia usually remits when the drug is stopped, but recurs if drug 
is given in the future. 
Diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome requires demonstration of a laboratory abnor- 
mality on at least 2 occasions 8 weeks apart. 
Aplastic anaemia is.a potentially fatal disorder, in which T cell responses to precursors of all 
three lineages can produce an empty marrow. 
: 
Active systemic vasculitis is accompanied by an APR that may be quite marked. 
Biopsy evidence of vasculitis proves that the patient has an autoimmune disorder. 
ANCA is useful in Wegener’s granulomatosis and microscopic polyarteritis, as the majority of 
patients with active systemic disease are positive. Other types of vasculitis are usually ANCA 
negative. 
Henoch-Schonlein purpura usually resolves in children, but is more serious in adults. 
Rapid introduction of steroids is essential to prevent blindness in patients with temporal 
arteritis. 
Autologous HSC transplantation can be used for all of the indications for allogeneic trans- 
plantation. 
In the leukaemias, allogeneic transplantation is preferred.

GvHD is usually easy to treat, and rarely occurs in a well-matched graft. 
2.28a. 
Hyperacute rejection occurs when an organ is transplanted into a patient with preformed anti-

IMMUNOTECHNIQUES AND 
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS USED IN 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
INTRODUCTION 
The aim of this part is to describe the diagnostic tests that are performed in a clinical 
immunology laboratory. The principles underlying immunological techniques are explained 
and illustrated. There is a concise description of each specific test that includes clinical indi- 
cations, principles of the test, interpretation and potential pitfalls. This part is cross-referenced 
with Clinical Immunology (Part 2) and provides the practical information that is necessary for 
the effective use of a clinical immunology laboratory.

Laboratory Tests in 
Clinical Immunology 
— 
CLINICAL INDICATIONS 
Before requesting a test, it is important to decide what clinically useful information will be 
obtained from the result, that is, the clinical indication for testing. 
The value of laboratory tests in the care of patients varies greatly and they may be 
grouped as follows: 
¢ 
Essential for diagnosis and monitoring 
Useful for subtyping disorders with different complications and outcomes 
¢ 
Limited to research applications (with potential for future use in the diagnostic 
laboratory). 
Sd 
No matter how good a test is, it will not be helpful if ordered in inappropriate 
circumstances. 
HOW GOOD IS A TEST? 
The ideal test distinguishes all patients with a particular condition (true positives) from all 
patients with conditions other than the one of interest, and from healthy individuals (true 
negatives). In real life, this rarely occurs. Correct interpretation of test results is dependent 
on many parameters including patient characteristics, laboratory techniques, operator 
characteristics, predictive values of particular tests and quality performance. Some factors 
that influence test performance are outlined here along with terms widely used to describe 
laboratory test systems. This is by no means a complete account, but rather highlights 
important concepts in laboratory test evaluation. 
255 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
PARAMETERS THAT INFLUENCE TEST PERFORMANCE 
Predictive value of tests 
256 
There are four possible relationships between test result and disease status (Table 3.1.1). 
Erroneous conclusions (i.e. false positive and false negative results) are possible with 
almost all test systems. Several terms are used to indicate test performance in this regard: 
Specificity 
Diagnostic specificity is the ability of a test to indicate a negative result 
in the absence of disease. It is the percentage of patients who do not have the disease 
and whose test result is negative. 
Number of true negatives * 100 
| 
Specificity = 
—— 
= 
Number of true negatives + Number of false positives 
A positive result in a test that is very specific for a disease or clinical state may be used to 
confirm clinical diagnosis. 
The term specificity is also used to describe the ability of an assay to measure one com- 
ponent without interference from others (i.e. absence of cross-reactivity). 
Sensitivity 
Diagnostic sensitivity is the ability of a test to indicate a positive result in 
the presence of disease. It is the percentage of patients with the disease whose test 
result is positive. 
Number of true positives X 100 
Sensitivity = 
= 
Number of true positives + Number of false negatives 
A negative result in a test that is very sensitive may be used to exclude disease. 
The term sensitivity is also used to describe the ability of a test to detect small quantities 
of the protein or antibody being measured. 
Positive and negative predictive values 
The positive predictive value (PPV) of a test 
is the proportion of patients with positive tests who have disease. It measures how well 
the test establishes a diagnosis. PPV is critically dependent on the prevalence of the 
disease in the population tested. The prevalence of disease is the total number of cases 
of a particular disease existing in a population at a certain time. 
Number of true positives X 100 
PPV % = 
ee 
= 
Number of true positives 
+ Number of false positives 
The negative predictive value (NPV) of a test is the proportion of patients with negative 
results who do not have disease. It measures how well the test rules out disease. It is also 
dependent on the prevalence of the disease tested.

Accuracy and precision 
¢ 
Accuracy is the ability of an assay to obtain results that are very close to the true value. 
¢ 
Precision refers to an assay’s ability to obtain reproducible results when it is repeated 
on different occasions. 
Inaccuracy and imprecision arise from two types of error. Systematic error refers to an 
ongoing bias in test performance that hinders results, for example, persisting problems with 
test technique such as worn machinery, deteriorated control or test specimens. Random 
errors occur when variability in techniques, for example, measuring, timing or counting, 
impair quality; specimen error is usually due to inadequate specimen labelling. 
Reference ranges 
Without a well-constructed reterence range, accuracy and precision are meaningless. Testing 
of a large population of healthy individuals, and in some cases patients with diseases other 
than that of interest, is required to define the level of the analyte in this unaffected popula- 
tion. The larger this group, the more reliable the reference range will be (at least 100). The sam- 
ple should be representative of the general population with regard to age, sex and ethnicity. 
The reference range is usually defined as the range of values that fall within two standard devi- 
ations (SD) of each side of the mean result. If results are normally distributed, this will include 
95% of the normal population. The percentage of patients with disease who have an abnor- 
mal result depends on the test sensitivity. 
When a reference range is being selected, it is important to decide whether sensitivity or 
specificity is more important. A reference range with high sensitivity (nearly all patients 
with a disease will have a positive result) is desirable in a screening test like anti-nuclear 
antibody (ANA) (for SLE) where follow-up of positive samples by more specific tests (anti- 
double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA Abs)) occurs. 
Cut-off point 
The cut-off point for any assay is the point above which results are considered positive. It 
must be set so that the minimum number of patients with disease are tested negative (false 
negative) and as few as possible individuals without disease are tested positive (false positive). 
Laboratory test categories 
Quantitative assays measure concentrations and numbers, for example, complement or 
immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in g/L or mg/ml; numbers of cells in a given volume. 
International reference material with a known concentration or number of the ana- 
lyte/cell being measured is available for standardisation of many tests within and 
between laboratories. 
 Semi-quantitative assays define a range of values between which the unknown sample 
value falls. The results may be expressed as a titre or as classes, for example, negative, 
weak, moderate or strong positive, if a known standard has been used for comparison. 
257 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Titres — Many laboratory tests are carried out at an optimal serum dilution selected to 
maintain assay sensitivity and specificity. In assays used to detect circulating autoanti- 
bodies, such as indirect immunofluorescence 
(IIF) and agglutination assays, the 
amount of antibody present is indicated by titration of a positive serum by serial dilu- 
tion. The titre is defined as the reciprocal of the last dilution where a positive reaction 
is seen, that is, the endpoint. Defining the endpoint of a titration is usually highly sub- 
jective. Whenever a titre is reported, the accuracy is assumed to be plus or minus one 
dilution. For example: 
— 
ANAs are detected by IIF 
— 
Acommon screening dilution for ANAs is 1/40 
— 
If serum is positive for ANA at 1/40, then serial doubling dilution is performed to 
obtain the serum dilutions 1/80, 1/160, 1/320 
— 
The last point at which positive fluorescence is observed is 1/160 
— 
Therefore, the ANA titre is 160 
— 
In practise, the titre may be reported as the dilution or as the reciprocal of the 
dilution. 
Qualitative assay results are usually expressed in the following terms: negative, 
positive; normal or abnormal; present or absent. International reference material may 
not be available. Determination 
of the cut-off point requires extensive 
clinical 
validation and is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity required. 
INTERPRETATION 
258 
The correct interpretation of laboratory tests requires some knowledge of the test 
performance parameters described above. However, in all cases tests should only be 
interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation. Treat the patient not the test.

Antibodies are Essential 
Tools in the Clinical 
Immunology Laboratory 
An extensive range of assays have been developed that can yield quantitative or qualitative 
measurement of antigen (e.g. protein chemistry) or antibody (e.g. detection of autoantibodies). 
Many of these assays utilise customised antibodies (Table 3.2.1). 
Antibodies that are used as tools in the clinical immunology laboratory may be raised in 
animals. Immunisation using the antigen of interest induces production of antibodies that 
can be isolated for use in immunoassays.

TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
¢ 
The antigen may be a protein such as a human complement component; antibodies to 
complement components are used to measure complement levels by nephelometry or 
by radial immunodiffusion (RID). 
¢ 
Human antibody is a foreign antigen to other species: antibodies that recognise human 
immunoglobulins are used to detect antibodies (against autoantigens or infectious 
organisms) in patient’s serum. 
Antibodies 
are 
used 
as primary reagents 
to detect antigen 
levels where antibody/ 
antigen immune complex formation is detected by precipitation assays such as RID or 
nephelometry. 
Antibodies may also be labelled with a fluorescent dye, enzyme or radioisotope to 
facilitate the detection and/or measurement of antigen or antibody using a range of 
immunoassays. 
POLYCLONAL AND MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES 
ARE USED AS LABORATORY TOOLS 
Polyclonal antibodies 
In response to foreign antigens, animals make polyclonal antibodies, that is, a mixture of 
antibodies produced by different clones of B cells, each having its own specificity for 
different epitopes on the same injected antigen. Each antibody has a different variable

ANTIBODIES ESSENTIAL IN THE LABORATORY 
region. The majority of antibodies are raised in mice and rabbits, although other animals 
may also be used. Antibody is purified from animal serum usually by affinity chromatography. 
Different batches of polyclonal antibody may not behave in an identical manner in an assay. 
Some human antigens are poorly immunogenic in animals as a result of a high degree of 
homology (similarity). Use of animals with distinct antigenic differences (e.g. guinea-pig, 
chicken, etc.) may overcome this problem. 
Monoclonal antibodies 
Monoclonal antibodies are the product of a single B cell clone and its progeny. Each of 
these antibodies have identical variable regions and react with identical epitopes. Spleen cell 
suspensions from immunised mice contain numerous secreting B cells from different clones 
many of which recognise the antigen of interest. These B cells are fused with cells from a 
non-secreting myeloma line to form hybrids: the spleen cell provides the ability to make 
specific antibody while the myeloma cell provides the ability to grow indefinitely in culture 
and secrete immunoglobulins continuously. 
After fusion, the hybrid cells are selected using drugs that kill the myeloma parental cell, 
while the unfused parental spleen cells have a limited life-span and die. Only the hybrid 
myeloma cell lines or hybridomas survive. Hybridomas producing antibody of the desired 
specificity are identified and cloned by regrowing cultures from single cells. The affinities 
of the antibody as well as cross-reactivity patterns are used to select the most useful antigen- 
specific clone. It is important to appreciate that while all monoclonal antibodies are 
identical, this does not guarantee that they will be monospecific. Unfortunately many mono- 
clonal antibodies are of relatively low affinity and cross-react with proteins other than the 
analyte of interest (Figure 3.2.1).

Detection of Antibodies 
and Antigen 
DETECTION OF ANTIBODY — AUTOANTIBODIES 
The hallmark of many autoimmune disorders is the presence of specific autoantibodies 
circulating in the blood and/or deposited in the affected tissue. Organ-specific and non- 
organ specific autoimmunity results in a multitude of overlapping clinical disorders. The 
detection of autoantibodies provides diagnostic and prognostic information and is useful in 
monitoring disease activity. 
Some autoantibodies are directly involved in disease pathogenesis making them highly 
specific for the disease (e.g. anti-GBM antibody and Goodpastures syndrome). Other 
autoantibodies are epiphenomena, either produced incidentally or arising as a consequence 
of the tissue damage associated with a disease process. Although not directly pathogenic, 
such autoantibodies may be useful serological markers of disease. Many autoantibodies are 
found in healthy subjects, particularly in older people. When interpreting the clinical 
significance of autoantibodies, the clinical history, examination and other laboratory 
information should be considered. 
DETECTION OF ANTIGEN — MEASUREMENT OF PROTEIN LEVELS 
Many of the methods used for the detection and measurement of autoantibodies are also 
used to measure the concentration of proteins including many involved in the immune 
response. This is important in the investigation of immunodeficiency and inflammatory 
markers. 
IMMUNOASSAY TECHNIQUES 
Precipitation assays 
These assays depend on the formation of insoluble immune complexes when antibody and 
antigen concentrations reach equivalence. 
DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES AND ANTIGEN 
Radial ImmunoDiffusion (RID) 
Wells are cut into agarose containing antibody to the 
analyte of interest. A series of standards of known analyte (antigen) concentration and 
unknowns (patient sera) are placed into the wells. The antigen diffuses radially from the 
well and a ring of precipitate forms around the well at the antigen-antibody equivalence 
(precipitin ring). The diameter of the ring is proportional to the concentration of analyte in 
the well since the antibody concentration in the agarose remains constant. Using standards 
of known analyte concentration, a calibration curve is generated by plotting the square of 
the diameter against concentration. The calibration curve is used to determine the concen- 
tration of analyte in test sera (Figure 3.3.1). 
Nephelometry or turbidimetry 
When immune complex formation takes place in the liquid 
phase, the light absorbing/scattering properties of the solution change and can be measured. 
Nephelometry measures the amount of light scattered at a defined angle to the incident 
beam. Turbidimetry measures the reduction of incident light due to absorption. Patient 
serum is diluted and incubated with antibody against the component of interest; this may be

a protein, such as a complement component. Alternatively, when measuring antibody con- 
centration, patient serum is incubated with antigen. Formation of antibody-antigen com- 
plexes leads to an increase in the light scattering or turbidity of the solution. This process 
may be measured at equilibrium or during complex formation using a nephelometer or 
turbidimeter. In the presence of a constant amount of antibody, the concentration of the 
component of interest may be measured. Inaccuracies can arise if the antigen of interest is 
present in excess concentration relative to the detecting antibody-antigen excess. Further 
dilution of test serum allows accurate measurement to be made. Lipaemic or haemolysed 
samples interfere with the optical properties of the solution and are not suitable for analysis. 
Double diffusion 
Antigen and antibody solutions are placed in wells cut into an agarose 
gel and allowed to diffuse for several days. Preciptin lines form in the gel where antigen and 
antibody reach equivalence. Precipitating antibodies to specific antigens in patients’ sera can 
be detected using this method, where antigen is placed in a central well, and control or 
patients’ sera are placed in surrounding wells (Figure 3.3.2). 
Counter-current immunoelectrophoresis 
Antigens and antibodies 
are electrophoresed 
towards each other in an agarose gel made up in a suitable buffer. Patients’ and reference 
sera are placed in a line of wells cut into the agarose, and antigen is placed into a trough or 
line of wells parallel to this. Negatively charged antigens will move towards the anode (+) 
and antibodies will move towards the cathode (—). If the patient’s serum contains a relevant 
antibody, a precipitin line is formed between the wells. After electrophoresis, precipitin lines 
may visualised by drying the agarose gel and staining with Coomassie Blue stain. The speci- 
ficity of the antibody can be ascertained by comparing precipitin lines formed by patient sera 
with control sera. Formation of a line of identity (both precipitin lines merge imperceptibly) 
between patient and control sera allows antibody specificity to be identified. Counter-current 
immunoelectrophoresis (CCIE) is used to detect anti-ENA antibodies (see Figure 3.4.3).

gives greater precision than RID and facilitates 
greater speed, 
automation and objectivity; it is suitable for large throughput tests. 
¢ 
Standard preparations, which have been calibrated against International WHO 
standards, are available for most common analytes. 
Agglutination assays 
Antigen is coated onto an inert carrier particle such as gelatin, latex beads or red blood cells 
(RBCs). Serum containing specific antibody agglutinates antigen-coated 
particles. 
Agglutination results in the formation of a ‘carpet’ of particles at the base of a round- 
bottomed reaction well (microtitre plate). If no antibody is present in the serum, the particles 
will form a tight ‘button’. The endpoint titre is the last serum dilution where agglutination 
is still 50% greater than the serum incubated with non-coated particles. Agglutination assays 
are not class-specific and detect all agglutinating antibody; IgM pentamers are more efficient 
at agglutinating antigen-coated particles/RBCs. Agglutination is used to detect anti-thyroid 
antibodies and rheumatoid factors. Agglutination is the basis for the Direct Coombs’ test for 
detection of anti-RBC antibodies (Figure 3.3.3).

TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Some serum components may react non-specifically with gelatin particles or RBCs in 
agglutination assays and this may interfere with the detection of antibodies. If present such 
heterophile antibodies must be fully adsorbed prior to use of a particle agglutination assay. 
Enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) 
ELISA for the detection of antibody 
Test serum is incubated in microtitre plates that have 
been coated with purified antigen. After washing to remove unbound serum constituents, an 
enzyme-labelled anti-immunoglobulin antibody is incubated with the bound antibody. After 
washing to remove unbound conjugated antibody, enzyme-labelled antibody is visualised by 
the addition of a chromogenic enzyme substrate. Colour development is proportional to the 
concentration of antibody in the test serum and is measured spectrophotometrically. Using 
known positive sera, a standard curve 
is generated to determine the antibody levels 
(expressed in arbitrary units or International Units (IU) if the assay is calibrated against an 
international standard). ELISAs are sensitive and specific assays. Antigen purity determines 
the specificity of the assay. ELISAs are readily automated and with increasing availability of 
purified or recombinant antigens are commonly used to detect antibodies (Figure 3.3.4). 
Sandwich ELISA 
Serum containing the analyte (antigen) is incubated in a microtitre 
plate coated with a capture antibody. A second enzyme-labelled antibody, which recognises 
a different antigenic site on the antigen of interest, is added. Following incubation, 
unbound antibody is removed by washing. After addition of a chromogenic enzyme 
substrate, colour development is proportional to the concentration of antigen in the 
test serum and is measured spectrophotometrically. This type of ELISA is suitable for

measuring analytes other than antibodies. Modifications of this technique can increase the 
sensitivity, allowing very low concentrations of analyte be measured (e.g. cytokines). 
Radioimmunoassay 
Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) are laboratory tests in which either antigen or antibodies are 
radiolabelled. RIAs designed to measure antibody levels utilise excess radiolabelled antigen, 
which 
is incubated with patient serum, 
as well 
as 
a series of standard antibody 
preparations. The antigen bound to antibody is then precipitated either with a specific 
precipitating second antibody or by a non-specific protein precipitant (e.g. ammonium 
sulphate). Precipitated antigen (quantified using a beta counter) is proportional to the 
antibody concentration (Figure 3.3.5). 
The use of RIAs in the clinical immunology laboratory is largely restricted to the 
detection of high-affinity anti-dsDNA antibodies (Farr assay), anti-AChR and anti-TSH 
receptor antibodies. RIA is sensitive and specific. It is limited in use because of the hazards 
associated with dealing with radioactive isotopes (I'*°) and the short shelf life of RIA 
reagents. 
ELISA 
is more 
sensitive 
but often 
less specific than RIA. ELISA detects both 
high- and low-affinity antibodies, while RIA detects only high-affinity antibodies;

TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
high-affinity antibodies are often more closely disease associated. ELISA reagents are less 
hazardous than radioactivity and usually last longer. 
Indirect and direct Immunofluorescence 
Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is a commonly used technique that detects autoantibodies 
in serum when they bind antigens in an appropriate substrate (rodent, primate or human 
antigen-expressing tissue sections or cultured cells). Bound antibody is stained with a fluo- 
rescein (FITC)-labelled anti-immunoglobulin antibody, and visualised using ultraviolet (UV) 
fluorescence microscopy. Antibody specificity may be inferred from the pattern of staining 
observed, however confirmatory objective tests are generally used when available. Titration 
gives a semiquantitative estimate of the amount of autoantibody present in serum. Human 
serum contains heterophile antibodies that react with non-human animal tissues but not 
with human tissues. These must be distinguished from patterns produced by true autoanti- 
bodies on rodent tissues. It is essential to use serum not plasma for IIF as fibrinogen causes 
non-specific fluorescence (Figure 3.3.6). 
Direct immunofluorescence (DIF), is used to demonstrate antibody and complement 
deposition in patients’ tissues. Fresh tissue, usually from a skin or renal biopsy is snap frozen 
in liquid nitrogen and sectioned (7 ym sections) onto glass slides. These sections of tissue are 
incubated with FITC-conjugated antisera against complement components (C3 and C4), igs 
(IgA, IgG and IgM) and fibrin. This allows visualisation of the deposited antibody or com- 
plement components in a distinctive pattern with a fluorescence microscope. The pattern of 
deposition of these components in tissue (e.g. skin or kidney) may be diagnostic of several 
diseases. Tissue-bound antibody may be present in the absence of circulating autoantibody.

Flow cytometry 
Flow cytometry can be used to analyse single particles, where specific molecules (e.g. cluster 
of differentiation (CD) markers) or functions (e.g. calcium release) can be indicated using 
fluorescent techniques. In diagnostic immunology, the most common applications are 
measurement of lymphocyte subpopulations after staining with fluorescence-labelled 
antibodies, and characterisation of leukaemias and lymphomas. Using flow cytometry the 
percentage of a cell population expressing a particular marker, as well as the intensity of 
expression can be objectively measured in thousands of individual cells within a short time. 
Flow cytometry can also be used to measure antibody in serum, using antigen(s) of interest 
immobilised on fluorescent beads or donor cells (see Section 3.15). 
Additional 
applications 
include measurement 
of any cell function 
for which 
a 
fluorescent probe is available such as Ca** flux, reactivé oxygen intermediate production 
and intracellular cytokine production. 
Cell marker studies 
For cell marker studies, aliquots of fresh anti-coagulated whole blood are incubated with 
fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibodies. This is followed by red cell lysis and usually 
fixation of cells. The cell suspension is aspirated into the flow cytometer and cells pass 
in single file past a laser beam, which excites the fluorescent probes. Light sensors detect 
light scatter emitted by each individual cell. Cell populations vary in size and granularity,

affecting the forward and side scatter properties of the light. Specified limits on light scatter 
can be used to ‘gate’ on the cell population of interest, often supplemented by analysis of 
fluorescence with anti-CD45 (all white cells) and anti-CD14 (monocytes). Further analysis 
of cell markers can be limited to the gated population. 
Light emitted by excited fluorescent dye on the cell surface is detected by sensors, 
amplified by photomultipliers and analysed by computer software. The instrument may 
have a number of detectors for a number of different fluorescent dyes (FITC, phycoerythrin 
(PE)) — this is essential for double labelling of cells (known as two-colour analysis). Routine 
applications involve up to four-colour analysis, allowing four parameters in addition to 
light scatter to be measured for each cell. The data may be displayed as single parameter 
histograms; dot plots where two parameters are compared, or even three-dimensional plots 
(Figure 3.3.7). 
If absolute counts are required a known volume of a bead suspension (where the count 
per ml is known) is added to the stained cell suspension. When the appropriate number of

Notes: Immunoblotting can be used for the detection of specific antibodies in patient sera. Gel electrophoresis of a stan- 
dard antigen preparation separates proteins according to their size (molecular weight). At the same time a mixture of 
proteins of known molecular weights is also run. These separated proteins are transferred to another matrix (e.g. nitro- 
cellulose membrane), which is suitable for subsequent immunodetection methods. The membrane is cut into separate 
strips and incubated with control or patient sera. Specific antibody binds protein on the membrane strip and unbound 
serum components are removed by washing. Bound antibody is detected with an enzyme-labelled antibody and visu- 
alised by the addition of a suitable substrate.

gated events has been acquired by the flow cytometer, the ratio of beads to cells of interest 
is compared and the absolute cell count derived mathematically. For analysis of lymphocyte 
subtypes, 
results expressed in absolute numbers rather than percentages 
are more 
meaningful. 
Immunoblotting of antibodies/antigens 
Immunoblotting (also know as Western blotting) is a multistage procedure where proteins 
are separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a semipermeable membrane and probed 
with antibody (Figure 3.3.8). Bound antibody is visualised using an appropriate detection 
system. This system may be used to investigate the presence of specific antibody in patients’ 
sera, or characterised antibody can be used to investigate the presence of proteins of inter- 
est in biological samples. In addition to its value in routine diagnostics, immunoblotting 
can be used to begin to identify previously unknown antibody specificity in patient’s serum. 
Detection of ANA specificities by immunoblotting is illustrated in Figure 3.4.4. 
Immunoblotting is a powerful tool for detection of antibodies that recognise linear 
epitopes (dependent on the amino acid sequence alone) as the process of electrophoresis 
frequently denatures proteins. Immunoprecipitation may be required to detect antibodies

Autoantibody Profiles in 
Connective Tissue Diseases and 
Rheumatoid Disease 
RHEUMATOID DISEASE 
Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are autoantibodies directed against the Fe portion of IgG. RF 
may be IgM, IgA or IgG but IgM is most commonly measured. The presence of IgM RF is 
included in the American Rheumatological Association (ARA) clinical criteria for diagnosis 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Clinical indications 
Suspected rheumatoid disease. 
¢ 
Inflammatory, symmetrical polyarthropathy (hands and feet especially) 
* 
 Periarticular bony erosions on X-ray 
¢ 
Features of extra-articular rheumatoid disease, including: 
— 
Sjogrens syndrome 
— 
Lymphadenopathy 
— 
Scleritis and episcleritis 
— 
Cutaneous vasculitis and ulceration 
— 
Skin and lung nodules 
- 
— 
Pleural effusions, alveolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans 
— 
Pericarditis, endocarditis 
— 
Splenomegaly (often neutropaenia) 
— 
Myositis, mononeuritis multiplex, cord compression from spinal involvement. 
Principle of the test 
RFs are routinely detected by particle agglutination or nephelometry. Nephelometry gives 
quantitative data with high precision and accuracy. 
Latex agglutination test — latex particles coated with human IgG agglutinate when 
incubated with serum containing RE. 
272 
AUTOANTIBODIES 
IN CTDs AND RHEUMATOID DISEASE 
In nephelometry, serum is diluted and incubated with RF antigen (aggregated human 
IgG) resulting in complex formation. The rate of light scatter is proportional to the 
concentration of RF in the serum sample. 
Interpretation 
* 
RF is present in up to 90% of patients with RA, but is not specific for RA. Negative 
RF does not exclude disease. 
¢ 
Strongly positive RF is suggestive of rheumatoid disease. A high RF level in rheumatoid 
disease is a. poor prognostic factor. Extra-articular features, such as rheumatoid 
nodules and vasculitis are more common. 
¢ 
Strongly positive RF may also be found in Sjégren’s syndrome and cryoglobulinaemia. 
¢ 
RF levels do not vary significantly with changes th disease activity; CRP is a better 
indicator of activity. 
RF may also occur in a wide variety of conditions including connective tissue diseases, 
infections and lymphoproliferative conditions. Infection-induced RF usually disappears 
following adequate treatment. The presence of RF becomes more common with increasing 
age (over the age of 70 years, 5-10 % of the healthy population will have detectable RF). 
Frequency of IgM RFs (varies with assay technique) 
¢ 
RA 
50-90% 
* 
Sjogrens syndrome 
70-80% 
¢ 
SLE 
15-35% 
@ 
Juvenile RA 
7-10% 
¢ 
 Polymyositis 
5-10% 
@ 
Chronic infection 
up to 50% (usually weak). 
Pitfalls 
¢ 
The levels of RF may fluctuate with the use of disease-modifying drugs such as gold 
and salazopyrine, but this is not a reliable guide to response to therapy. 
¢# 
RFs may occur in a variety of situations where it does not necessarily indicate disease 
and therefore it is important to interpret RF results in the context of the clinical setting. 
¢ 
Frequently, relatives of patients with RA are weakly RF positive; this does not indicate 
disease.

AUTOANTIBODIES ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTIVE TISSUE 
DISEASES (CTDs) 
Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) — also known as anti-nuclear factor (ANF) 
ANAs are autoantibodies directed against a variety of constituents of cell nuclei including 
DNA, RNA and nuclear proteins. ANAs directed against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), 
273 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
centromeric proteins and the extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) are the most clinically sig- 
nificant. ENAs include antibodies to Ro, La, Sm, RNP, Jo-1 and Scl-70. Other ANA speci- 
ficities of interest include anti-histones, anti-PM-Scl, anti-Ku, and anti-Mi-2 antibodies. 
Antibodies to Ro, Jo-1, ribosomal-P protein and signal recognition protein (SRP) bind cyto- 
plasmic antigens, but are also of interest in diagnosing CTDs. Despite their cytoplasmic 
location Ro and Jo-1 are loosely termed ENAs in clinical practice. 
Clinical indications 
* 
Suspected CTDs — SLE, Sjogrens syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 
scleroderma, CREST syndrome 
(calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, oesophageal 
dysmotility, sclerodactyly and telangiectasiae), polymyositis/dermatomyositis. 
# 
Autoimmune hepatitis (ANA only). 
¢ 
Investigation of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) or immune thrombocytopaenia 
(ITP) to exclude associated CTD (SLE). 
Principle of the test 
ANA is usually detected by IIF on HEp-2 cells, a cell line containing large nuclei. Rodent 
liver is also used as a substrate. ANAs react with nuclear antigens including dsDNA and 
ENAs. ANA reactivity is clarified by additional methods including ELISA, RIA and 
immunoblotting. 
The main staining patterns observed include homogenous, speckled, centromere and 
nucleolar. The staining patterns are distinguished by evaluation of resting and dividing 
cells. They are a poor guide to antibody specificity. 
¢ 
Homogenous pattern 
—- in resting cells, the nucleus stains evenly throughout. In 
dividing cells the condensed chromosomal region is positive while the surrounding 
cytoplasm is negative (Figure 3.4.1(a)). 
@ 
Speckled pattern — in resting cells, there are speckles of fluorescence throughout the 
nucleus. Mitotic (or dividing cell) chromosomes are negative (Figure 3.4.1(d)). 
* 
Centromere pattern — in resting cells, discrete uniform points of fluorescence through- 
out the nucleus are observed. In mitotic cells, the speckles cluster in the chromosome 
mass giving the classical centromere pattern (Figure 3.4.1(c)). 
* 
Nucleolar pattern — in resting cells the nucleolus is stained (Figure 3.4.1(b)). 
¢ 
Mixed patterns occur when a patient’s serum contains more than one type of ANA. 
Strong positive ANAs should be investigated further to identify significant autoantibody 
specificities (anti-dsDNA and anti-ENA antibodies). 
Important notes on ANA testing by IIF 
274 
# 
Only IgG-ANAs are of proven clinical value. 
¢ 
Antibodies have a long circulating half-life and therefore frequent measurement of 
ANA is unhelpful. 
¢ 
The use of human epithetial cell line (HEp-2) cells rather than rodent liver has several 
advantages: 
— 
Nuclei are large, allowing easier pattern recognition 
— 
More sensitive assay 
— 
Required for anti-centromere antibody identification.

(d) speckled and (e) IIF on C. Iuciliae — kinetoplast (K) and nucleus (N) are shown. See Plate Section for 
colour reproduction of these images. 
Interpretation 
4 
Interpretation of ANAs is dependent on the clinical situation, and the age and sex of the 
patient. Strongly positive ANAs are associated with CTDs and autoimmune liver disease. 
Weak ANA is often a non-specific finding, seen more commonly in women and the 
elderly, and in many inflammatory disorders (including infection). However, if clinical 
suspicion of a CTD is strong, then anti-dsDNA and anti-ENA antibody follow-up 
testing should be performed. 
A negative ANA result, using a sensitive test system, makes SLE or CTD very unlikely. 
A wide variety of drugs may induce ANAs (often associated with anti-histone anti- 
bodies). Drug-induced ANA usually disappears within 6 months of drug withdrawal. 
In practice, speckled or homogenous patterns are poor indicators of antibody specificity 
and both anti-dsDNA and anti-ENA antibodies may be associated with either pattern. 
275 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
¢ 
Anti-centromere antibody is found in CREST syndrome, in about 10% of patients with 
scleroderma, as well as 13% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). 
# 
Nucleolar ANAs are associated with scleroderma and autoimmune liver disease, but 
are not specific for these conditions. 
¢ 
Inpatients with known CTDs serial measurement of ANA is not helpful at monitoring 
disease activity. 
Pitfalls 
When HEp-2 cells are used for ANA detection, the increased sensitivity results in many 
weak false positives (approximately 20% of women over the age of 60 years are positive 
unrelated to disease), Care must be taken with interpretation.

Detection of Antibodies and Antigen 
ANTI-DOUBLE STRANDED DNA (dsDNA) ANTIBODY 
Anti-dsDNA antibodies (Abs) are useful in diagnosis and monitoring of SLE. As dsDNA is 
found in cell nuclei, anti-dsDNA antibodies will result in staining of nuclei by IIF, regardless of 
substrate. 
Clinical indications 
Diagnosis and monitoring of SLE. 
Principle of the test 
276 
Three assays for the detection and/or measurement of anti-dsDNA antibodies are in routine 
use: the Farr assay, IIF and ELISA. Antigen quality is pivotal in ensuring the quality of both 
Farr and ELISA assays. DNA exists in three forms: dsDNA, z-DNA and single-stranded 
DNA (ssDNA). Anti-dsDNA but not anti-ssDNA is relatively specific for SLE. Helical 
DNA treated with $1 endonuclease removes ssDNA, improving assay specificity. 
Farr assay 
High-affinity anti-dsDNA antibodies are detected in this quantitative RIA. I!?>- 
labelled dsDNA is added to the test serum and bound by anti-dsDNA antibodies, if present. 
Precipitation using ammonium sulphate brings down anti-dsDNA antibodies bound to 
labelled dsDNA, leaving unbound dsDNA 
in solution. 
Antibody-bound-I!*>-labelled 
dsDNA is measured using a scintillation counter. The amount of anti-dsDNA antibody 
present is proportional to the amount of recovered radioactivity (Figure 3.4.2). 
IIF 
Crithidiae luciliae is a parasitic haemoflagellate, in which the kinetoplast contains 
pure dsDNA. Anti-dsDNA antibody staining of this specialised organ is detected by IIF. 
Staining of the nucleus is not specific for anti-dsDNA antibodies (Figure 3.4.1(e)). 
ELISA 
Measurement 
of anti-dsDNA 
antibodies by ELISA detects both high- and 
low-affinity antibodies. Quantification of antibody by ELISA is straightforward and pre- 
cise, and makes follow-up straightforward. ELISA also avoids the use of radio-nucleotides. 
AUTOANTIBODIES IN CTDs AND RHEUMATOID DISEASE 
Notes on the use of different assays to measure anti-dsDNA antibodies 
¢ 
Detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies by IIF on Crithidia luciliae is highly specific but is 
less sensitive than the Farr assay or ELISA. IIF is less useful for monitoring disease 
activity. 
@ 
ELISA methods show high sensitivity but reduced specificity, possibly related to 
detection of low-affinity antibodies or antibodies that bind contaminating ssDNA 
(ssDNA can be removed by $1 endonuclease treatment). 
Interpretation 
* 
High levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies are suggestive of SLE. As many as 80% of suf- 
ferers are positive depending on the assay used. Anti-dsDNA antibodies may also be 
found in autoimmune hepatitis. 
¢ 
Some SLE patients may be negative when first tested but if clinical suspicion is high, 
should be retested in 3-6 months. 
¢ 
Quantitative measurement of anti-dsDNA antibody levels is used for monitoring dis- 
ease activity in patients with SLE. However, since the half-life of IgG is 3 weeks, it is 
not helpful to measure levels more frequently than this unless a patient is undergoing

plasmapheresis. Levels of anti-dsDNA usually rise before a clinical relapse or flare, 
however occasionally levels may fall precipitously before a flare, as anti-dsDNA is 
incorporated into immune complexes which lodge in tissues causing the clinical flare. 
¢ 
The presence of RF (IgM) may cause interference in ELISAs that detect both IgG and IgM 
anti-dsDNA antibodies (IgG anti-dsDNA are more clinically relevant). This should be con- 
sidered when a strongly positive anti-dsDNA antibody is seen with a negative ANA. 
¢ 
False negative results may be seen when cryoglobulinaemia complicates SLE, as the 
anti-dsDNA antibody may be lost in the cryoprecipitate.

le of the test 
ELISA 
ELISA may be used to screen for and identify the precise anti-ENAs present using 
microtitre plates that have been coated with purified antigens (Ro, La, Sm, RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1) 
either alone or in combination. A two-stage procedure is often used: an initial screen of 
patient’s serum with a mixture of four or six antigens; followed by an identification ELISA with 
individual antigens which is performed on screen positive sera. 
Counter current immunoelectrophoresis (CCIE) 
This assay is carried out in two stages: 
an initial screen of sera for reactivity to antigen extract is followed by an identification step 
where positive sera are run with reference sera of known specificity to identify specific anti- 
bodies. The antigen preparation now most commonly used is calf thymus. However, due to 
concerns about prion disease, this antigen source is rarely used. Human spleen extract is a 
rich source of Ro antigen, however due to concerns about HIV and difficulty with obtain- 
ing consent, this is no longer in routine use. Jo-1 and Scl-70 can only be detected in freshly 
extracted thymus, and as repeated extraction is impractical, ELISA is more commonly used 
to detect antibodies to these antigens (Figure 3.4.3).

Detection of anti-ENA antibodies is useful in diagnosis, but not follow-up of patients. Most 
well-established assays are qualitative, however anti-ENA antibody levels have never been 
shown to reflect disease activity. In view of the obstetric implications, it is reasonable to repeat 
anti-ENA tests when a patient with SLE or other CTD becomes pregnant (Table 3.4.1). 
Pitfalls 
¢ 
Most patients that are anti-ENA antibody positive also have a positive ANA. However, 
Ro and Jo-1 are predominantly cytoplasmic in location and this may result in a nega- 
tive ANA. Hence anti-ENA antibodies should be specifically requested when there are 
suggestive clinical features despite a negative ANA. 
¢ 
CCIE is moderately sensitive, but is specific for most antigen types. As a result of 
increased sensitivity, the use of ELISAs may give false positives thus reducing disease 
specificity. 
¢ 
Poor antigen purity may result in false positive results on ELISA. This should be con- 
sidered if antigens not usually found in combination are detected.

ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME 
Anti-cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant 
Anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACA) are directed against cardiolipin (a phospholipid), in the 
presence of a protein co-factor B2-glycoprotein 1. 
Related anti-phospholipid 
antibodies 
include lupus anti-coagulants, and antibodies 
to other phospholipids 
(phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethano- 
lamine, phosphatidylinositol). Anti-cardiolipin antibodies may give rise to false positive 
syphilis serology (VDRL). 
Lupus anti-coagulants are antibodies that interfere with the clotting process im vitro.

Principle of the test 
ELISA 
Anti-cardiolipin antibodies 
(IgG and IgM) — 
anti-cardiolipin 
antibodies 
bind 
cardiolipin in the presence of the serum co-factor B2-glycoprotein 1 (Apolipoprotein H). It is 
thought that when B-glycoprotein 1 binds cardiolipin, it exposes a conformational epitope on 
cardiolipin, which the antibody recognises. Patient sera are incubated in microtitre wells that 
have been coated with cardiolipin and B2-glycoprotein 1 as substrate. 
Detection of lupus anticoagulants (plasma required) 
Lupus anti-coagulants cause a pro- 
longed activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), kaolin clotting time (KCT) and dilute 
Russell viper venom test (DRVVT). International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 
guidelines for demonstration of lupus anti-coagulant require: 
@ 
Prolonged phospholipid-dependent coagulation demonstrated 
on two 
of three 
screening tests 
¢ 
Failure to correct the prolonged coagulation time by mixing with platelet-poor plasma 
¢ 
Exclusion of other coagulopathies as appropriate. 
Interpretation 
¢ 
Anti-cardiolipin antibodies: 
— 
Are reported semiquantitatively as weak, moderate or strong positive. Laboratory 
criteria for diagnosis of APS require detection of moderate or strong positive IgG 
or IgM ACA on two or more occasions at least 6 weeks apart, measured by 
standardised ELISA for B2-glycoprotein 1-dependent anti-cardiolipin antibodies. 
Nintey per cent of patients with APS have detectable ACA. 
— 
Weak positive antibodies may be non-specific, associated with infection or other 
inflammatory conditions. 
¢ 
Lupus anti-coagulant — for diagnosis of APS, lupus anti-coagulant must be present in 
plasma on two or more occasions at least 6 weeks apart. This antibody is detected in 
60% of APS patients. 
Pitfalls 
° 
284 
Cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anti-coagulant recognise different phospholipid

independently of the other and present with similar clinical problems.

B>-glycoprotein 1. This is a serum co-factor that binds anionic phospholipids in vivo 
and its normal function is to inhibit coagulation and platelet aggregation. Clinically 
significant 
anti-cardiolipin 
antibodies 
bind cardiolipin 
only in the presence 
of 
B>-glycoprotein 1, however some patients also have antibodies to 8y-glycoprotein 1 alone.

Anti-B5-glycoprotein 1 antibodies are detected by ELISA. 
Interpretation 
Anti-B5-glycoprotein 1 — the role of these antibodies is currently under investigation. They 
may be useful in patients suspected of having APS but are negative for ACA and lupus anti- 
coagulant. It is positive in 80% of affected individuals.

ANTI-NEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODIES 
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) 
are autoantibodies directed against 
cytoplasmic components of neutrophils and monocytes. Clinically, the most significant 
ANCAs are those directed against the cytoplasmic enzymes proteinase-3 (PR3) and 
myeloperoxidase (MPO). Other minor ANCA specificities include bactericidal permeabil- 
ity increasing protein (BPI), catalase, cathepsin G, elastase, lysozyme, lactoferrin and

of the test 
ANCA is detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on human peripheral blood neu- 
trophils. Two patterns of fluorescence are seen most commonly — cytoplasmic or C-ANCA 
and perinuclear or PPANCA. ANCA bind different cytoplasmic antigens including PR3 and 
MPO. These two main ANCA specificities PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA, and other minor 
ANCAs are confirmed by ELISA.

See Plate Section for colour reproduction of these images. 
(a) 
ANCA - indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) 
Ethanol-fixed normal human peripheral blood neutrophils are used as a substrate. The 
staining patterns observed by IIF include C-ANCA, P-ANCA and atypical ANCA. P-ANCA 
is distinguished from C-ANCA when ethanol is used as the cell fixative. P-ANCA is an arti- 
factual pattern that results from the re-distribution of these negatively charged cytoplasmic 
antigens during ethanol fixation (Figure 3.5.1 (a) and (b)). 
¢ 
C-ANCA pattern refers to classical cytoplasmic granular fluorescence with central 
interlobular accentuation. This pattern is most commonly produced by the antigen 
PR3, a granule enzyme. 
# 
P-ANCA produces perinuclear fluorescence with nuclear extension. Multiple antigens 
produce this pattern including MPO. 
¢ 
Atypical ANCA refers to staining patterns other than C-ANCA or P-ANCA and may 
comprise a combination of cytoplasmic and perinuclear fluorescence. These patterns of 
fluorescence may also be divided into C-ANCA (atypical), PPANCA (without nuclear 
extension) and atypical ANCA. 
Notes on ANCA testing by IIF 
¢ 
JIF should be performed on serum samples from all new patients. 
¢ 
Optimal serum dilution for ANCA screening is 1/20. 
¢ 
IgG-ANCA is the most clinically significant class of ANCA detected. 
¢ 
The endpoint titre is required when ANCA levels are monitored by IIF, however 
antigen-specific ELISAs are more accurate methods for quantifying antibody levels. 
ANCA - ELISA 
ANCA positive sera (including C-ANCA, P-ANCA and atypical ANCA) are tested for PR3 
and MPO reactivity using ELISA. Serial measurement of ANCA levels by quantitative 
ELISA is helpful for patient monitoring. IIF-ANCA positive sera that are negative for PR3- 
ANCA and MPO-ANCA when tested by ELISA, may be further characterised by additional 
ELISAs, however this is not performed routinely. 
Interpretation 
¢ 
C-ANCA occur 
in over 70% of patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis (more 
frequently 
in active generalised untreated 
disease, 
less frequently without renal 
287 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
involvement) and in 30% of those patients with microscopic polyangiitis. Most of 
these are PR3-ANCA. 
¢ 
P-ANCA with MPO specificity occur in 50-80% of patients with active microscopic 
polyangiitis (may be renal limited) and in up to 25% of patients with Wegener’s 
granulomatosis. Occasional ANCA positive patients with RPGN also have anti-GBM 
antibodies. 
¢ 
Atypical-ANCA occur in some patients with IBD, sclerosing cholangitis, RA, SLE, 
chronic 
active hepatitis and 
in chronic 
infections 
such 
as cystic fibrosis and 
bronchiectasis. 
Pitfalls 
¢ 
ANA fluorescence may interfere with ANCA ITF. ELISA testing for PR3-ANCA and MPO- 
ANCA allows exclusion of vasculitis-associated ANCA despite the presence of ANAs. 
¢ 
Occasionally, C-ANCA occurs with MPO specificity and P-ANCA occurs with PR3 
specificity.

AUTOANTIBODIES ASSOCIATED WITH RENAL DISEASE 
Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody 
These are autoantibodies directed against the a-3-chain of type IV collagen found in 
glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. GBM antibodies are pathogenic. They 
induce Type II hypersensitivity resulting in anti-GBM disease, a rare but important cause 
of acute renal failure. 
Clinical indications 
“ 
* 
Suspected anti-GBM disease 
— 
Pulmonary haemorrhage 
— 
Acute renal failure 
— 
Pulmonary renal syndrome. 
Principle of the test 
IIF 
Anti-GBM antibodies can be detected in serum by IIF using human or monkey kidney 
as substrate. The presence of these antibodies generates a typical linear glomerular staining 
pattern, similar to that seen by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) on renal biopsies. 
288 
AUTOANTIBODIES IN VASCULITIS AND RENAL DISEASES 
Rapid screening and ELISA 
Early diagnosis of anti-GBM disease is essential and a 
rapid screening test has been produced commercially. In 5 min the presence of anti-GBM 
antibodies can be detected. ELISA may be used to screen for or quantitate the levels of anti- 
GBM antibodies in serum. Serial measurement of GBM antibodies by quantitative ELISA 
is essential for monitoring patients’ response to therapy. 
Notes on anti-GBM antibody tests 
¢ 
_IIF is insensitive, and is not suitable for monitoring antibody removal. 
¢ 
DIF on renal biopsy remains the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of 
anti-GBM disease. 
Interpretation 
@ 
<Anti-GBM antibodies are found in almost all cases of recent onset Goodpasture’s 
disease. Even in the absence of treatment, these antibodies will disappear over a 6-24 
month period. 
* 
Serial measurement 
of anti-GBM 
antibodies by quantitative ELISA 
is valuable 
for monitoring the response to plasmapheresis as well as long-term response to 
immunosuppression. 
¢ 
Some patients with anti-GBM antibodies may also have PPANCA (MPO-ANCA) and 
this group may respond to aggressive therapy, even when dialysis-dependent at 
presentation.

IIF-AMA is detected by IIF on a composite block of rodent liver, kidney and stomach

ing pattern as AMA (Figure 3.6.1). Several AMA subtypes may be detected by IIF (M1, 
M2, MS, M6), but distinguishing these subtypes by immunofluorescence is difficult. 
¢ 
Confirmatory follow-up testing (by ELISA or immunoblotting) is helpful to confirm 
the presence of the M2 subtype. 
Notes on AMA testing 
# 
AMA may also be detected by IIF on HEp-2 cells where granular cytoplasmic staining 
is observed. IIF on rat LKS should be performed for confirmation.

MICROSOMAL (LKM) ANTIBODY 
Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMAs) are directed against intracellular microfilaments, 
including actin, vimentin, desmin and tubulin. Anti-LKM antibodies are directed against 
microsomes in the cytoplasm of hepatic cells and proximal renal tubular cells. Three types 
of LKM antibodies have been described, of which LKM-1 antibodies, directed against 
cytochrome p450, are the most important (Figure 3.6.2).

guished from AMAs by the differential staining of renal tubules and lack of staining in 
the stomach.

Lower titre SMAs may be detected in patients with PBC, and after an infection 
SMAs may also be found in 5-15% of normal individuals (low titre) 
Anti-LKM antibodies are found in type II autoimmune hepatitis, and in some patients 
with Hepatitis C. These antibodies are of no known prognostic significance in Hepatitis 
C.(lable3.621); 
Anti-LKM antibodies may resemble AMA, particularly when anti-GPC antibody is also 
present. LKM antibodies may be found in patients who are Hepatitis C positive.

AUTOANTIBODIES ASSOCIATED WITH GI DISEASE 
Anti-endomysial antibody and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody 
Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (t[G) antibody are 
directed against the same target antigen, t?G. Coeliac disease is usually associated with 
EMA or anti-tTG antibodies of IgA-class, but IgG-EMA or IgG-anti-tTG antibodies may 
be significant in patients with IgA deficiency. 
Clinical indications 
* 
Suspected gluten sensitive enteropathy 
— 
Coeliac disease (malabsorption, diarrhoea, etc.) 
— 
Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) (itchy, blistering rash). 
¢ 
Incidental detection of R1 type anti-reticulin antibody by IIF on composite block of rat 
LKS. 
Principle of the test 
* 
IIF-IgA-EMAs are detected using monkey oesophagus as substrate and FITC-labelled 
anti-IgA. EMAs produce a distinctive staining pattern — a network of thin irregular 
lines around individual smooth muscle fibres in the muscularis mucosa, producing a 
‘lacework’ pattern (Figure 3.6.3). 
@ 
ELISA 
—- Anti-tTG antibodies 
are detected by ELISA. Human tTG gives better 
sensitivity. 
Interpretation 
* 
Detection of EMA is consistent with a diagnosis of coeliac disease. The diagnosis is 
confirmed by jejunal biopsy, which shows villous atrophy.

Pitfalls 
AUTOANTIBODIES IN LIVER AND GI DISEASES 
IgA-EMAs are found in 90-100% of patients with coeliac disease and 50-70% of 
those with DH, with high specificity (90-100%) (Table 3.6.2). 
Removal of gluten from the diet results in the gradual disappearance of this antibody 
from the circulation (over months to years). 
One in thirty patients with coeliac disease have selective IgA deficiency. IgA deficiency 
should be excluded in all patients undergoing coeliac screening using IgA based assays 
only. IgG-EMA should be measured routinely in IgA deficient patients. 
A false negative result may also be obtained when a patient is on a gluten-free diet. 
The characteristic staining (IIF) associated with EMAs may be obscured in the presence 
of a smooth muscle antibody. 
Antibody binding to tTG in ELISA systems is critically dependent on the calcium con- 
centration of the buffer solutions. 
ANTI-GLIADIN ANTIBODY AND ANTI-RETICULIN ANTIBODY 
Anti-gliadin antibodies (AGAs) are directed against a-gliadin, a water insoluble fraction of 
gluten, which is found in wheat, barley and rye. 
Antibodies directed against reticulin, 
a component of connective tissue are of five 
different types and are detected by IIF. IgA antibodies to the R1 type of reticulin are closely 
associated with coeliac disease. 
Clinical indications for AGA testing 
Suspected gluten sensitive enteropathy. 
Principle of the test 
AGAs (both IgA and IgG) are measured by ELISA. Anti-reticulin antibody (IgA) is detected 
by IIF using a composite block of rodent LKS. The antibody shows a distinctive linear 
staining pattern around the tubules in the kidney, together with staining of the intergastric 
glands in the submucosa and blood vessels. R1 reticulin antibodies may be distinguished 
from other reticulin antibodies by their staining pattern in the kidney. 
Interpretation 
S 4 
AGA - Significantly positive IgA-AGA is found in coeliac disease and in DH. Weak 
levels are not specific for these disorders. IgG-AGAs may be found in bowel disease 
associated with increased mucosal permeability, but are also useful in patients with IgA 
deficiency. In cases where there is a positive IgG-AGA but a negative IgA-AGA, IgA 
deficiency should be excluded (Table 3.6.2). 
IgA-AGA are also found in the following patients who carry a risk of developing CD 
— 
Adults and children with diabetes mellitus (DM) (type I) 
— 
First-degree relatives of patients with coeliac disease 
— 
Patients with Down syndrome. 
IgA and IgG AGAs may be useful for monitoring compliance with a gluten-free 
diet.

IgA anti-R1 reticulin antibodies are fairly specific but insensitive markers for coeliac 
disease. IgG anti-reticulin, as well as other patterns of IgA anti-reticulin are not specific for 
coeliac disease. However, when a reticulin antibody is detected during autoantibody 
screening, testing for anti-endomysial antibody is worthwhile.

Interpretation 
¢ 
Anti-GPC antibody is positive in 90% of patients with pernicious anaemia (PA). IF 
antibodies are less sensitive (present in 50-70%) but are highly specific for this 
condition. 
¢ 
Anti-GPC antibodies may be found in asymptomatic patients with gastric atrophy 
some of whom will develop PA. They are found in 2-10% of normal individuals. 
¢ 
PA is strongly associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (50% of patients with PA have 
anti-thyroid antibodies), while 30% of patients with thyroiditis have anti-GPC antibodies. 
¢ 
PA may also be associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APGS). GPC 
antibodies may be found in APGS types I and III.

Principle of the test 
Anti-TM and anti-TG antibodies can be detected by agglutination techniques (using red 
blood cells, gelatin or other particles coated with TPO or TG, respectively) or using ELISA. 
Interpretation 
5 
Pitfalls 
Anti-TM antibodies are found in 99% of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease 
(Table 3.7.1). Many patients are also positive for anti-TG, however anti-TG are rarely 
found alone. 
The presence of these antibodies in asymptomatic individuals may be predictive of 
future hypothyroidism. 
Anti-thyroid antibodies during pregnancy indicate a risk of post-partum thyroiditis, 
which can be associated with post-partum depression. 
Anti-thyroid antibodies may be found in patients with other autoimmune diseases 
including pernicious anaemia, Addisons disease, and Sjogren’s syndrome. 
Anti-TG should be measured in patients with follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland 
if thyroglobulin levels are used as a tumour marker — measurement of TG is unreliable 
in antibody positive subjects. 
Some serum components may react non-specifically with gelatin particles or RBCs in 
agglutination assays and this may interfere with the detection of thyroid antibodies. If 
present, such heterophile antibodies must be fully adsorbed prior to use of a particle 
agglutination assay. 
ANTI-ISLET CELL ANTIBODY AND ANTI-GAD ANTIBODY 
These autoantibodies are directed against islet cells of the pancreas, the main target anti- 
gen being glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). GAD is involved in the release of insulin 
from secretory granules, and is also found in the GABAminergic neurones involved in the 
control of muscle tone. Distinct isoenzymes are found at both sites.

TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Principle of the test 
5 
5 
IIF — Anti-islet cell antibodies are detected using human pancreatic tissue as substrate. 
Immunoblotting — Anti-GAD antibodies may be detected by immunoblotting. There 
are two types of GAD autoantibody: one binds conformational epitopes and is 
associated with IDDM, while the other binds linear epitopes and is associated with 
Stiff Man syndrome. Only the anti-GAD antibodies that recognise linear epitopes 
(i.e. associated with Stiff Man syndrome) are routinely detected by immunoblotting. 
Interpretation 
5 
Anti-islet cell antibodies are present in 65-85% of newly presenting IDDM, but 
disappear within 1-2 years. A small group of patients with multiple autoimmune 
endocrine diseases maintain their antibody levels. 
Anti-islet cell antibodies are seen in first-degree relatives of patients (2-5%) with 
IDDM who have a high risk of developing the disease: the presence of these antibodies 
increases the risk of developing diabetes 75-fold. 
10% of patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes (type II) will have islet cell 
antibodies and have a higher risk of progression to insulin-dependence. 
Type I DM is clinically associated with coeliac disease, so patient’s serum should also 
be screened for anti-EMAs. 
Anti-GAD 
antibodies 
have been described 
in IDDM (conformational 
epitope 
antibodies) and in 60% of patients with the very rare Stiff Man syndrome (linear 
epitope antibodies). 
ANTI-ADRENAL ANTIBODY

Principle of the test 
Anti-adrenal antibodies are detected by IIF using monkey adrenal gland as the substrate. 
The staining pattern results from these antibodies reacting with microsomes of the zona 
glomerulosa, zona fasiculata and zona reticularis. 
Interpretation 
Anti-adrenal antibodies are found in:

AUTOANTIBODIES IN ENDOCRINE DISEASES 
Autoimmune adrenal disease is closely related to organ-specific autoimmune disease and at 
least 40% of patients have at least one other autoimmune endocrinopathy and should 
undergo appropriate antibody screening. 
Multiple autoimmune endocrinopathies can occur together or sequentially in patients - 
these conditions are described as autoimmune polyglandular syndromes. Non-endocrine 
organ-specific autoimmune conditions frequently accompany these syndromes, which are 
described in Section 2.15.

Pitfalls 
ANT 
OTHER ORGAN-SPECIFIC AUTOIMMUNITY 
¢ 
Detection of anti-platelet antibodies is difficult and this test should be performed in a 
specialised laboratory. 
¢ 
It is important to distinguish between anti-platelet autoantibodies and alloantibodies, 
including anti-HLA antibodies that bind platelets. 
l-ERYTHROCYTE (RED BLOOD CELL) ANTIBODIES 
Anti-red blood cell (RBC) antibodies may be classified as warm antibodies or cold anti- 
bodies (cold agglutinins). 
Warm antibodies are specific for a particular RBC antigen or a mixture of RBC surface 
antigens (a major target is the Rhesus system); they are usually IgG class. 
Cold agglutinins are autoantibodies that reversibly agglutinate RBCs in the cold causing 
small vessel obstruction in the skin of the extremities. The main antibody specificities are 
anti-i, anti-I and anti-Pr (RBC cell surface antigens); they are usually IgM, and may be 
monoclonal. 
Clinical indications 
Princip 
@ 
Suspected autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) 
— 
Anaemia 
— 
Jaundice or laboratory evidence of haemolysis 
— 
Raynauds phenomenon. 
le of the test 
Anti-RBC may be detected bound to RBC (direct Coomb’s test), or unbound antibody may 
be detected in serum (indirect Coomb’s test). Warm antibodies are detected at 37°C, 
while cold antibodies are detected at 4°C. Anti-RBC antibodies are investigated for the 
temperature of maximal activity, specificity, complement binding and agglutinating or 
haemolytic activity. 
Direct Coomb’s test 
Antibodies and complement components are detected on the surface 
of red cells by means of an ‘anti-globulin agent’ that contains anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) and 
anti-C3 antibody. This reacts with Igs and C3 but cannot distinguish between specific anti- 
bodies directed against the red cells, and immune complexes firmly adsorbed onto the red cell 
surface. Specific antibodies to IgG, IgM and C3 can be used at different temperatures to type 
the antibody. 
Indirect Coomb’s test 
In patient’s serum, circulating autoantibodies to RBCs can be 
detected by incubating the serum with red cells. After washing, the red cells are washed and 
incubated with ‘anti-globulin agent’. 
Interpretation 
AIHA is categorised according to the temperature at which haemolysis takes place. 
@ 
Warm antibodies are found in 50% of patients with AIHA — warm AIHA. Warm AIHA 
may be idiopathic or secondary to SLE, CLL, lymphomas or viral infection. 
¢ 
Cold agglutinins may be associated with infection or lymphoproliferative disease. 
303 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
Pitfalls 
* 
Cold agglutinins bind red cells in the cold. They are distinct from cryoglobulins, which 
are immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold. 
¢ 
Incorrect collection and transport of the blood sample will render it unsuitable for the 
assay. 
AUTOANTIBODIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
AUTOIMMUNE SKIN DISEASE 
Anti-basement membrane zone antibody 
Anti-basement membrane zone (anti-BMZ) autoantibodies are directed against keratinocyte 
hemidesmosomal proteins. The specific antigens recognised in bullous pemphigoid (BP) are 
BP230 and BP180. 
Anti-epidermal intercellular substance antibody 
Anti-epidermal intercellular substance (anti-ICS) antibodies recognise the intercellular sub- 
stance of the epidermis and the main target antigens are desmoglein-1 and 3 (intercellular 
adhesion molecules), and under some circumstances desmoplakin-1 (a desmosomal protein). 
Clinical indications 
 Blistering skin disease +/— mucosal lesions with suspicion of autoimmune cause 
— 
Bullous pemphigoid, herpes gestationis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita 
— 
Pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, paraneoplastic pemphigus. 
Principle of the test 
IIF - These antibodies may be detected in serum by IIF using monkey oesophagus, human 
skin or other epithelial substrates. Anti-BMZ antibodies produce linear staining along the 
basement membrane zone between the epithelial layer and submucosa. Anti-ICS produce a 
typical chickenwire staining pattern in the epithelium (Figure 3.8.1). 
Usually a skin biopsy will also be taken and sent for histology and direct immunofluores- 
cence (DIF) which detects antibody deposited in the patient’s skin. Patterns seen on DIF are 
similar to those detected by IIF. 
Interpretation 
* 
BMZ antibodies are detectable in the serum of 70-90% of BP patients. This antibody 
is also detected in a small number of patients with epidermolysis bullosa acqusita 
(10%) and herpes gestationis (25%). The titre of anti-basement membrane antibodies 
in serum does not correlate with disease activity and antibody may still be found in 
serum during disease remission. 
¢ 
Intracellular substance antibodies are present in 70-90% of cases of pemphigus 
vulgaris. The titre of anti-ICS antibody in serum correlates well with disease activity. 
Low titres of anti-ICS antibody have also been detected in SLE, myasthenia gravis with 
thymoma, burns and some cutaneous infections (leprosy).

Pitfalls 
A complete investigation of the bullous skin diseases should include both IIF to detect 
circulating antibodies, and DIF on skin biopsy, and results should be interpreted with full 
clinical and histological information.

AUTOANTIBODIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASES 
Anti-neuronal antibodies — anti-Hu, Yo or anti-Ri antibodies 
Anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies (ANNA-1 and ANNA-2) are autoantibodies directed 
against the neuronal cell nuclei and are also known as anti-Hu and anti-Ri antibodies. 
Purkinje cell cytoplasm antibodies (PCCAs) are also known as anti-Yo antibodies. The 
antigen for anti-Yo antibodies is thought to be CDR34, which is expressed on epithelial 
tumours as well as on neuronal tissue. Anti- Yo, Hu and Ri are thought to be cross-reactive 
anti-tumour antibodies. 
Clinical indications 
¢ 
Suspected paraneoplastic neurological syndromes 
— 
Paraneoplastic 
cerebellar 
degeneration, 
ataxic 
sensory 
neuropathy 
or 
encephalomyelitis particularly in association with carcinoma of the breast, ovary 
and small cell lung carcinoma. 
305 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
Principle of the test 
IIF and immunohistochemistry — anti-Hu and anti-Yo antibodies are detected by IIF or 
immunohistochemistry using cerebellum as the substrate. 
5 
Sd 
Anti-Hu antibodies produce homogenous staining of neuronal nuclei in the granular layer 
of cerebellum. 
Anti-Yo antibodies stain cytoplasm of the Purkinje cells (at the junction of granular and 
molecular layers of the cerebellum). 
Anti-Ri antibodies stain neuronal nuclei; confirmatory testing is required for definitive 
identification. 
Immunoblotting, using cerebellar lysates, may be used to confirm the presence of anti- 
Hu, anti-Yo and anti-Ri antibodies detected by IIF screening. This technique is also 
useful for characterisation of novel antigens when unusual patterns of staining are 
detected by IIF screening. 
Notes on testing for anti-Hu, Yo and Ri antibodies 
¢ 
In IJIF using primate tissue substrate, sensitivity is improved by using anti-human 
antibodies which have been adsorbed to removed reactivity to primate tissue, reducing 
non-specific binding. 
# 
May be present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. 
@ 
May disappear following removal of the tumour. 
Interpretation 
¢ 
Anti-Hu 
antibodies 
are associated 
with small 
cell carcinoma 
of the lung and 
paraneoplastic syndromes; sensory neuropathies and encephalomyelitis. 
¢ 
 Anti-Yo antibodies are found in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration asso- 
ciated with ovarian cancer or Hodgkin’s disease. 
¢ 
Anti-Ri antibodies have been detected in women with breast cancer*together with 
ataxia, myoclonus and opsoclonus. 
¢ 
A positive result (Hu, Yo or Ri antibodies) should initiate further investigations for 
underlying malignancy. Tumours may be small and if no tumour is found, investiga- 
tions should be repeated after several months. 
Pitfalls 
Anti-Hu antibodies must be carefully distinguished from non-neurone specific anti-nuclear 
antibodies on immunofluorescence.

ANTI-ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR ANTIBODY 
306 
Autoantibodies (IgG) directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) found on skeletal 
muscle cells are associated with myasthenia gravis (MG). Anti-AChR may: 
5 
5 
a 
Bind the receptor at sites distinct from the binding site for acetylcholine 
Block the neurotransmitter binding site on the receptor 
Cause the accelerated degradation of AChR. 
OTHER ORGAN-SPECIFIC AUTOIMMUNITY 
Clinical indications 
* 
Suspected MG 
— 
Fatigue of voluntary muscles with weakness which increases with activity 
— 
Thymoma; thymic hyperplasia. 
Principle of the test 
Double antibody immunoprecipitation radioimmunoassay (RIA) — a-bungarotoxin binds 
specifically and firmly to the AChR protein, which is isolated from detergent — solubilised 
skeletal muscle. Radiolabelled AChR-toxin complexes are incubated with patient serum. The 
IgG-AChR-toxin complexes are separated from non-bound AChRs by a precipitation step 
using a second antibody to human IgG. The level of precipitated radioactivity is a measure of 
the antibody activity. Results are expressed as nmol/L of a-bungarotoxin binding activity. 
Interpretation 
¢ 
These antibodies are found in 80-90% of patients with MG. However, a negative 
result does not exclude this diagnosis. In ocular MG, antibodies are only detected in 
60% of patients. 
¢ 
These antibodies 
are absent in healthy individuals, and in patients with other 
neurological disorders. 
¢ 
These antibodies (IgG isotype) can be transferred across the placenta and cause neonatal 
myasthenia. 
GANGLIOSIDE ANTIBODIES 
Sialylated glycolipids form part of the myelin sheath. In Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) 
and immune-mediated neuropathies, autoantibodies including anti-GM1, GD1b, GQ1b, 
GT1la and LMI antibodies are seen. These antibodies react with epitopes in carbohydrate 
domains of molecules and there is a high frequency of cross-reactions with other 
carbohydrate-rich molecules including bacterial capsular lipopolysaccharides, for example, 
Campylobacter jejuni. 
Clinical indications 
¢ 
Suspected GBS and the Miller—Fischer variant 
¢ 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
¢ 
Paraprotein associated neuropathies. 
Principle of the test 
These autoantibodies are detected by immunoblotting or ELISA. 
Interpretation 
¢ 
Antibodies to GM1 and other gangliosides including LM1 and GD1b have been asso- 
ciated with GBS. 
¢ 
Antibodies to GQ1b have been associated with the Miller—Fischer variant of GBS (in 
90-100% of cases). 
307 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
¢ 
Anti-GM1, LM1 and GD1b antibodies can also be found in patients with CIDP and 
multifocal motor neuropathy. 
¢ 
In paraproteinaemic neuropathies, anti-GM1 antibodies may be the main specificity of 
the paraprotein (usually IgM).

Measurement of the Acute 
Phase Response 
Alterations in plasma proteins occurring in response to tissue injury are useful in detection 
and monitoring of inflammation. Direct measurement of specific reactants (e.g. CRP, a-1 
acid glycoprotein), or indirect measures (e.g. ESR), are used. The clinical utility of individual 
tests varies depending on the nature of the underlying disorder. 
CLINICAL INDICATIONS 
5 
¢ 
¢ 
Infections — Acute and chronic; especially relevant in bacterial sepsis, including atypical 
organisms and TB 
Inflammatory arthritis —- 
RA; SLE; other connective tissue diseases (CTDs) 
Systemic inflammation — Systemic CTDs; systemic vasculitides 
Malignancy — Lymphoreticular; renal cell cancer. Also, may be elevated if infective 
complications arise 
Possibly atherosclerosis — high sensitivity assay required. 
PRINCIPLE OF THE TEST 
CRP — measured by nephelometry 
ESR 
This is the most accurate indicator of the acute phase response. Highly sensitive assays are 
available and of possible value in cardiovascular medicine. High sensitivity assays are not 
required to monitor most inflammatory states where large increases in CRP occur. 
A negative charge on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs) inhibits aggregation. Acute 
phase proteins, most especially fibrinogen, but also a-macroglobulin and immunoglobulins, 
reduce electrical charge. As a result of this, RBCs sediment. The rate of sedimentation of 
fresh, anti-coagulated blood in a vertical column over 1 h is measured. 
309 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
INTERPRETATION 
CRP 
ESR 
Basal concentrations are extremely low. Increases are detectable within 6-8 h of the trigger- 
ing stimulus. The half-life of CRP is short and concentrations fall again within a few hours 
of response. Huge increases (up to a thousandfold) can occur in severe inflammatory states. 
CRP is the most accurate assay available for the assessment of acute inflammatory activity. 
# 
Levels are normal (<4 mg/l) in most viral states and in degenerative arthritis. 
* 
Modest increases (up to 100 mg/l) are seen in inflammatory arthritic conditions, as well 
as in certain viral illnesses (EBV, CMV, adenovirus), and in malignant disease. 
¢ 
Levels of >100 mg/l occur in systemic vasculitis, systemic bacterial infection and some- 
times in lymphoid malignancies. 
* 
Gross elevations (>300 mg/l) usually indicate serious bacterial infection or very severe 
vasculitis. 
Extremely sensitive modified nephelometric methods can identify minor variation in CRP 
levels, even if the absolute level is still within the normal population range. Such differences 
appear to be relevant in risk stratification of patients with ischaemic heart disease, and are 
thought to be a marker for inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques. Such high- 
sensitivity assays are also required for monitoring inflammation in neonates, where the 
basal level and peak level are much lower than in adults. 
Some elevation 
in the ESR occurs 
in most inflammatory 
states. 
Gross elevations 
(>100 mm/h) are most often related to: 
Tuberculosis 
Multiple myeloma 
Giant cell arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica 
Lymphoma 
Severe inflammatory synovitis 
Severe systemic bacterial infection. 
¢¢¢ 
6 
oO 
6% 
Fibrinogen has a slower rate of production, in comparison to CRP, in response to inflam- 
matory stimuli. It also has a long half-life. Significant lag phases between onset and reso- 
lution of inflammatory stimuli and subsequent variation in the ESR can occur. ESR is a very 
good indicator of chronic inflammation. 
PITFALLS 
310 
¢ 
CRP is often normal in active SLE. The ESR is a better indicator of activity in this 
condition. Elevation of CRP may result from superimposed infection. Severe serositis 
or synovitis may also cause CRP to rise in SLE. 
# 
CRP levels vary with age. Age-matched reference ranges are essential for correct 
interpretation. 
¢ 
ESR is elevated with anaemia, increasing age, female gender and oestrogen-rich states 
(pregnancy, use of combined oral contraceptives (OCPs)) even if inflammation is 
quiescent. These confounding factors can make interpretation difficult. 
MEASUREMENT OF THE APR 
¢* 
Drugs such as aspirin which carry a negative charge, can reduce the ESR, even in the 
absence of resolution of inflammation. 
The lag phase between alteration in the ESR and changing intensity of inflammation limits 
the usefulness 
of this assay 
in day-to-day monitoring of inflammatory 
states. 
Nonetheless, it remains a very useful indicator of chronic inflammation over extended 
periods.

Complement 
MEASUREMENT OF COMPLEMENT COMPONENTS 
Complement components C3 and C4 are routinely measured to diagnose and monitor 
autoimmune disease. Other complement components can be measured, although this is 
usually only necessary when complement deficiency is suspected. The pattern of abnormal- 
ity in CH50 and APSO complement function tests indicates which components should be 
measured (see Section 3.11). 
Clinical indications 
¢ 
SLE, immune complex glomerulonephritis and vasculitis — diagnosis and monitoring 
* 
 Angioedema without urticaria 
* 
Follow-up investigation of absent CHS0 or APSO. 
Principle of the test 
Complement components can be measured by nephelometry or RID. Nephelometry is usually 
used for C3 and C4, as these components are frequently measured in large numbers. RID is 
used in most laboratories for measuring other complement components. 
Notes on the measurement of complement levels 
¢ 
Normal ranges for C4 are very wide because C4A and C4B null alleles occur frequently 
in the normal population. 
¢ 
Serum should be frozen as rapidly as possible to prevent ex vivo C3 or C4 cleavage which 
results in artificially high levels for these components if measured by RID.

Interpretation 
Pitfalls 
Low C3 and C4 suggest that activation of the classical pathway has occurred. Normal C4 
levels with low C3 levels suggest that the alternative pathway has been activated in isola- 
tion. Low C4 with normal C3 indicates early classical pathway activation, which results 
from fluid phase activation (Table 3.10.1). 
Serial measurement of C3 and C4 is useful in monitoring disease activity in immune com- 
plex disease, including SLE and cryoglobulinaemia. Low levels of C3 and C4 usually return 
to normal in remission. 
C3 and C4 levels are generally raised in pregnancy, therefore low normal levels in a 
pregnant patient with SLE may reflect worsening disease activity. 
C4 levels must be interpreted carefully. There are two C4 genes, C4A and C4B. An 
individual’s normal serum concentration of C4 depends on the number of expressed and ‘null’ 
alleles which they possess. By performing a number of C4 measurements, the normal level for 
an individual can be established and this facilitates interpretation of changes in C4 levels. 
In patients with angioedema or crampy abdominal pain a low C4 may indicate C1 
inhibitor deficiency. C4 remains reduced between attacks of angioedema. 
A persistently low C3 may be indicative of the presence of a C3 nephritic factor. In 
infective endocarditis, low or reduced C3 levels may indicate glomerulonephritis. 
Complement components are acute phase reactants, and raised levels of C3 and C4 are 
frequently seen during an acute phase response. When inflammation results from immune 
complex disease complement consumption may be masked by the increased rate of com- 
plement synthesis due to the acute phase response. In these cases the measurement of C3 
breakdown products may be helpful. 
COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION PRODUCTS 
Only intact native C3 can be detected in normal plasma provided blood is immediately put 
into ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). C3 breakdown in vivo results in a number 
of breakdown products, of which C3dg has the longest half-life. C3a is unstable and rap- 
idly degraded, however if intact C3, C3b and C3c are removed from the plasma, available 
assays can accurately measure C3dg. An example of such a technique is double-decker 
rocket electrophoresis. 
Complement activation may also be demonstrated by measuring plasma levels of 
multimolecular activation complexes including C1r:C1s:C1-Inh, C3bBbP and C5b-9 (by 
sandwich ELISA). 
313 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
Interpretation 
C3dg levels are increased due to complement activation, and are not masked by the acute 
phase response. 
C3dg levels correlate with disease activity in SLE and are also elevated in patients with 
severe diffuse cutaneous disease associated with systemic sclerosis. 
AUTOANTIBODIES TO COMPLEMENT 
COMPONENTS 
—- C3-NEPHRITIC FACTOR 
C3-nephritic factor is an autoantibody that binds and stabilises the alternative pathway C3 
convertase enzyme. This prevents the natural destruction of this enzyme by the regulatory 
proteins factor H and factor I. The presence of C3-nephritic factor results in continuous C3 
breakdown and depletion. 
Clinical indications 
¢ 
Unexplained low C3 in kidney disease or lipodystrophy 
¢ 
Type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. 
Principle of test 
C3-nephritic factor is detected by its ability to cause C3 cleavage in normal serum. The 
cleavage of intact native C3 molecules results in the generation of smaller molecules of C3 
including C3a, C3b, C3c and C3dg, which have different electrophoretic mobilities. The 
addition of patient serum (with C3-nephritic factor) to normal serum causes C3 cleavage. 
After incubation, the presence of the autoantibody may be inferred by examination of subse- 
quent changes to C3 mobility on electrophoresis followed by immunofixation, or crossed immu- 
noelectrophoresis (also called a Laurell plate) (Figure 3.10.1). Native and cleaved C3 may be 
detected simultaneously by using antisera to C3c or C3dg. 
Interpretation 
Pitfalls 
C3-nephritic factor 
is associated with type II, dense deposit, membranoproliferative 
glomerulo nephritis and partial lipodystrophy. It is reported as ‘present’ or ‘absent’ and may 
be IgG or IgM class. Typically, patients with MPGN will be ‘nephritic’? with haematuria, 
hypertension and oliguria. 
Patients with partial lipodystrophy and C3-nephritic factor are at significant risk of 
developing renal disease. Partial lipodystrophy is present in less than 50% of patients with 
nephritic factor. 
Normal serum used in these assays must be handled carefully in order to minimise spontaneous 
C3 cleavage. The measurement of C3-nephritic factor is a specialised test, only available in 
expert laboratories. 
ANTI-C1q ANTIBODIES 
314 
Anti-Clq antibodies have recently been described in patients with SLE and hypocomple- 
mentaemic 
vasculitis. These autoantibodies 
bind 
to Clq resulting in complement 
activation. Assays for these antibodies are not widely available currently, but are likely to 
become so in the next few years.

COMPLEMENT DEFICIENCY 
Deficiencies of complement components may be genetic (primary) or acquired (secondary 
to another disease). Genetic deficiencies of all complement components except factor B 
have been described, including the inhibitors C1-Inhibitor (C1-Inh), Factor I, Factor H, 
DAF and CD39. 
Clinical indications

Recurrent neisserial infections — especially meningitis 
Lupus-like disease; glomerulonephritis

¢¢¢ 
¢ 
Principle of the tests 
The diagnosis of a complement deficiency is performed in two stages: 
¢ 
Complement function assays to assess the functional integrity of the classical, alterna- 
tive and terminal pathways of complement activation. 
@ 
Measurement of individual complement component levels (as indicated by functional 
assays) to identify the missing components. 
Assays of complement function 
Total haemolytic complement 
-CHS0 
The total haemolytic complement assay measures the 
functional integrity of the classical complement pathway C1, C2, C3, C4 and the late compo- 
nents CS—C9. Patient serum, which should provide a source of complement, is added to sheep 
red blood cells (RBCs) sensitised with anti-RBC antibody (an immune complex). An intact 
classical pathway results in RBC lysis, which is measured with a spectrophotometer. The 
amount of serum (complement) required to cause 50% lysis is known as a CHSO unit. 
316 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
Alternative pathway haemolytic complement — APSO 
The alternative pathway total 
haemolytic complement assay (CH50) measures the functional integrity of the alternative 
pathway, C3, Factor B, Factor D and properdin and the late components C5-C9. Patient 
serum is added to guinea pig RBCs, which are susceptible to direct lysis by the alternative 
pathway. The assay is performed in the presence of Mg-EGTA, which chelates calcium pre- 
venting classical pathway activation. An intact alternative pathway results in RBC lysis, 
which is measured with a spectrophotometer. The amount of serum (complement) required 
to cause 50% lysis is called an APSO unit. 
Gel-based assays 
Patient serum diffuses from a well into agarose-containing sensitised 
sheep RBCs (for measurement of CH100), or guinea pig RBCs (for measurement of the 
AP100). Activation of complement leads to RBC lysis, which is evident as a clear zone 
around the well. The diameter of this clear zone is dependent on functional complement 
activity in serum. This is a semiquantitative assay, howeverit is a useful screen to exclude 
complement deficiency.

Interpretation 
The results of complement haemolytic assays and the possible complement deficiencies are 
summarised in Table 3.11.1. 
Complement consumption via the classical or alternative pathways may be so marked 
that the CH50 and APSO are reduced. However, a normal CH50 or CH100 does not 
exclude significant complement consumption.

Factor I or Factor H deficiencies may result in reduced levels of C3, which may in turn 
result in reduced CH50s and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (secondary). 
Deficiencies of regulatory complement proteins and receptors are associated with the 
following disorders (see Table 3.11.2). 
Pitfalls 
* 
Complement proteins are labile and therefore samples for functional assays must be 
processed and frozen at —80°C rapidly, and repeated freeze-thawing avoided. 
¢ 
Haemolytic activity of either pathway may be absent because of in vivo or ex vivo 
consumption of complement as well as deficiency. 
¢ 
Patients with an acute illness may show abnormal complement function and should be 
tested 3-4 weeks after the infection has resolved.

Pitfalls 
HIV 
Interpretation is based on the absolute cell counts rather than percentages of each cell subtype. 
The numbers of T and B cells present assist in the diagnosis of primary T and B cell 
immunodeficiencies. Patients’ results must be compared with age-related normal ranges. 
Interpretation is complex and should be carried out by the immunologist supervising the 
testing. 
Abnormal lymphocyte profiles are also seen in viral infections (HIV, EBV and CMY), acute 
bacterial infections, SLE, lymphoma, malignancy, chronic fatigue syndromes, drugs, toxins 
(alcohol and cigarettes), protein-losing enteropathy and splenectomy. 
Reduced lymphocyte levels are usual during long-term immunosuppressive therapy. 
¢ 
Monoclonal antibody therapy may mask antigens producing artificially low counts. For 
example, in patients receiving OKT3, use of anti-CD3 antibodies that bind the same CD3 
epitope as the therapeutic antibody, gives erroneously low results.

Lymphopaenia is common when patients are acutely ill. Where possible lymphocyte 
subsets should be measured when patients are in chronic stable state.

DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING 
Diagnosis of HIV depends on the detection of anti-HIV antibody, HIV antigen or HIV 
genomic material. Sequential measurement of CD4+ T cell numbers and the viral load are 
used to monitor disease progression and the need for and response to therapy. 
Clinical indications and principles of tests 
¢ 
Diagnosis of HIV infection — Anti-HIV antibodies are detected by ELISA, and their 
presence is confirmed by immunoblotting. Occasionally, PCR may be useful in diag- 
nosis of infection, particularly in neonates. CD4 T CELL COUNTS PLAY NO ROLE 
IN DIAGNOSIS OF HIV. 
¢ 
Monitoring of HIV infection — The viral load or concentration of HIV-RNA in blood 
is measured by quantitative PCR. Accurate measurement of helper T cell numbers is 
performed using flow cytometry, measuring dual-stained CD3+ CD4+ lymphocytes. 
Interpretation 
320 
The antibody response to HIV appears after a lag phase of up to 3 months. During this 
‘window phase’ infected patients may appear negative by antibody-based screening tests. 
Exclusion of HIV infection after a risk exposure requires a second test after 6 months to 
allow time for seroconversion. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
During seroconversion illness, there is a fall in the absolute CD4+ T cell count and 
an increase in CD8+ T cell count. Rarely, levels of CD4+ T cells may fall so low that 
opportunistic infections occur and this is a poor prognostic indicator. CD4+ T cell counts 
then return to normal or near normal, following on which there is a slow decline of CD4+ 
T cells over several years. Disease progression is characterised by the development of new 
symptoms and a rapid fall in CD4+ T cell numbers. 
Persistent lymphopaenia 
after seroconversion 
illness 
is a poor prognostic factor, 
particularly with a high viral load, and indicates the need for highly active anti-retroviral 
therapy (HAART). 
Pitfalls 
Less than 2% of lymphocytes are present in peripheral blood. Significant changes in the 
immune system can occur with minimal perturbation of peripheral blood counts (but massive 
depletion of CD4+ T cells in lymphoid organs occurs during the latent phase of HIV infection). 
A decrease in CD4+ T cells and an increase in CD8+ T cells is not specific for HIV 
infection and is seen in most acute viral infections. Therefore, the measurement of T cell sub- 
sets can never replace anti-HIV antibody testing or PCR in the diagnosis of HIV infection.

LYMPHOCYTE FUNCTION ASSAYS 
Immunodeficiency results when T or B cells are unable to function normally, even when 
they are present in normal numbers. Lymphocyte function may be tested in vivo (delayed 
hypersensitivity skin tests) or using im vitro proliferation assays. 
Clinical indications 
¢ 
Suspected T cell immunodeficiency 
¢ 
Clinical features suggestive of abnormal cell-mediated immunity. 
Principle of the tests 
¢ 
In vitro tests of T and B cell function — lymphocytes are purified from whole blood by 
density gradient centrifugation. When stimulated in culture, resting lymphocytes respond 
by proliferating, which is a measure of functional ability. Proliferation assays may be com- 
bined with measurement of T cell products, such as cytokines, in culture supernatants. 
— T cell function — proliferation assays — T cell proliferation assays are performed 
by stimulating cells in culture using antigens, mitogens, monoclonal antibodies or 
phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. The incorporation of tritiated thymidine 
into the DNA of replicating cells is a measure of proliferation. Results are 
expressed as the stimulation index — SI, that is, the ratio of counts in stimulated 
cells compared to unstimulated cells. A control sample from an age-matched 
healthy volunteer is used as control for assay variation as well as age-related 
variations (see Table 3.11.3). 
321 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
T cell function may also be assessed by flow cytometry to measure the surface 
expression of activation markers following stimulation (CD25, CD69, CD71 and 
intracellular cytokines). 
B cell function — may be tested by exposing mononuclear cells to the following 
stimulating agents in culture: 
Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) 
Anti-IgM + IL-2 
Staphylococcus strain 
A Cowan (SAC) 
EBV 
After seven days, the production of IgM, IgG and IgA in the cell supernatant are 
measured by ELISA. 
* 
In-vivo tests of T and B cell function 
Interpretation 
T cell function — tested in vivo by assessing delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. 
Appropriate antigens are injected intradermally and 72-96 h later a positive 
reaction results in a cellular infiltrate that is palpable with overlying erythema 
(wheal formation). The most useful antigens are Purified Protein Derivative (PPD), 
Candida, mumps and tetanus, which are available as single antigens. Responses 
depend on prior exposure. 
B cell function — the best assay of B cell function is the measurement of antibody 
production in vivo, which is described later in this section.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
Poor T cell proliferative response may also be seen in secondary immunodeficiency 
states including viral infections (CMV, rubella, influenza virus), bacterial infections 
(bacterial endocarditis), malignancy and immunosuppressive drug therapy. 
In vivo T cell function assay — poor responses are seen in primary T cell defects, 
combined defects and in some patients with CVID. They are also found in leukaemias, 
lymphomas and other malignant diseases, renal failure and during some chronic 
infections (e.g. HIV). 
In vitro B cell function assay — these tests are not commonly indicated however, the 
anti-lgM + IL-2 system may be used to identify subgroups of CVID. 
In vitro tests are performed in specialised referral laboratories with tissue culture 
facilities. Prior discussion is essential to choose the most informative tests. 
It is essential to exclude HIV before performing lymphocyte proliferation assays, as 
culture of HIV-infected lymphocytes is so hazardous that it can only be safely 
performed in Category 3 laboratories. 
Batch variability and lack of standards, make interpretation and comparison between 
laboratories difficult. 
In vivo tests are dependent on previous exposure to the test antigen.

MEASUREMENT OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS, IgG SUBCLASSES AND 
SPECIFIC ANTIBODY LEVELS 
Immunoglobulins (Ig) are also called antibodies or gammaglobulins (migrate to gamma- 
region during electrophoresis). IgG, IgA and IgM are the three major Ig classes detected in 
serum. IgE is present at very low levels in serum (see Section 3.14). IgD is rarely present in 
secreted form. There are four main subtypes or subclasses of IgG that are distinguishable 
structurally and functionally. The term ‘specific antibodies’ in clinical immunology refers to 
measurement of antibodies against specific microbial antigens or against blood group antigens.

Principle of the tests 
Levels of IgG, IgA and IgM are most often measured by nephelometry, which is rapid and 
automated. RID can also be used. Reference ranges for each of the immunoglobulin classes 
are defined on the basis of the values obtained in age- and sex-matched, normal control 
populations. 
Other methods using enzyme-, chemiluminescent- or fluorescent-probes can be used to 
measure Ig levels, but the high sensitivities achieved are not routinely necessary.

Interpretation 
Immunoglobulin concentrations 
below the 95% confidence 
limits of an age- and 
sex-matched control population is defined as hypogammaglobulinaemia (Table 3.11.4). 
Elevation in Ig levels is called hypergammaglobulinaemia. The rise in immunoglobulins may 
be monoclonal — meaning a single B cell population is causing the increase. This is covered 
further in Section 3.12. Polyclonal rises in immunoglobulins are the result of many differ- 
ent specificities of antibody being over-produced. Polyclonal rises may be class-specific or 
involve more than one class of immunoglobulin (Table 3.11.5). 
Pitfalls 
¢ 
Precipitation assays are accurate only if the detecting antibody is present at constant 
concentration in excess of the ‘antigen’ (antibody excess). Very high concentrations of 
immunoglobulin may be underestimated if antigen excess occurs, an error which can be 
avoided by interpreting immunoglobulin results in combination with electrophoresis. 
¢ 
Turbidity (cloudiness) of serum as occurs in haemolysed or lipaemic samples may also 
interfere with accuracy of results using nephelometry. 
¢ 
RID is labour-intensive and slow. 
¢ 
Abnormal immunoglobulin molecules (e.g. monoclonal IgM) or presence of immune com- 
plexes may interfere with diffusion and precipitation leading to inaccuracies in quantitation. 
¢ 
Normal total immunoglobulin levels do not equate with normal antibody-mediated 
immunity (see IgG subclass and specific antibody measurements).

Section 3.3. 
Detection of Antibodies and Antigen 
IgG SUBCLASSES 
Clinical indications 
Repeated infections — suspected primary immunodeficiency: IgG subclasses should be 
measured even if the total immunoglobulin levels are normal. Combined IgG subclass 
(IgG2 and IgG4 typically) and IgA deficiency may represent a type of CVID and some 
patients subsequently develop full-blown immunoglobulin deficiency. 
Principle of the test 
IgG subclasses, like total Igs are measured by precipitation assay. RID is currently used 
most commonly but nephelometry is also used. 
Interpretation 
IgG1 is the most abundant of the four IgG subclasses in serum. Deficiency usually results in 
low levels of total IgG. Clinically, patients with significant reductions in IgG1 behave as CVID. 
Deficiency of one or more of the other IgG subclasses may occur without reduction in 
total IgG levels. Major reductions in IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 either alone or in combination 
(usually IgG2 and IgG4) occur in perfectly healthy individuals. 
IgG subclass levels vary with age, sex and race. Accurate interpretation requires 
comparison with reference ranges drawn up from a matched control population. 
IgG subclass levels may be disturbed in a variety of conditions, for example, polyclonal 
rise in IgG1 with suppression of IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 in Sjogren’s syndrome; IgG3 
deficiency in a subgroup with asthma; IgG3 deficiency in some children with intractable 
epilepsy and complete IgG4 deficiency in some patients with bronchiectasis. There is no 
clear indication of what these deficiencies mean or how they should be managed and at 
the moment igG subclass analysis is not indicated in such conditions. 
Pitfalls 
Normal IgG subclass measurements must not be taken to mean that antibody-mediated immu- 
nity is normal. Total Ig levels may even be high in patients with IgG subclass deficiency. 
IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4 typically occur 
in responses 
to protein antigen challenges 
(e.g. viruses, tetanus, diphtheria). IgG2 production characteristically occurs on challenge with 
polysaccharide antigens (capsules of pyogenic bacteria). However, total IgG2 levels correlate 
badly with responsiveness to polysaccharide vaccines (e.g. Pneumovax®). Polysaccharide —- 
specific IgG of other subclasses is highly protective. Normal IgG subclass levels do not exclude 
defective specific antibody production. 
SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES 
It is possible to measure antibodies specific for certain pathogens either commonly 
encountered in the community (e.g. Pueumococcus) or encountered as part of the standard 
326 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
immunisation schedule (Tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB), Meningococcus strain 
C). Baseline levels of specific antibody, and levels before and after challenge with immunisa- 
tion, are measured. If baseline values are low, this provides an excellent test of antibody 
function in vivo. Natural antibodies, for example, blood group antibodies have been used as 
indicators of antibody function but microbial antibody testing has taken over in this area. 
Clinical indications 
* 
Suspected primary immunodeficiency — measurement of microbial antibodies (most 
commonly Pneumococcus and HiB) is indicated in patients with repeated bacterial 
infections typically involving the respiratory tract even if immunoglobulin and IgG 
subclass levels are normal. Response to test immunisation with the relevant vaccine is 
indicated if baseline levels are low. Specific antibody deficiency syndromes are increasingly 
recognised. 
¢ 
Secondary immunodeficiency — HIV infection, especially in children; post-bone mar- 
row transplant; splenectomised patients. 
¢ 
Vaccine failure — clinical infection after immunisation, for example, Haemophilus 
meningitis or septicaemia post HiB-conjugate vaccine; Hepatitis B vaccine failure. 
Vaccine failure is less clear-cut with Pneumococcus because of the huge variety of 
strains and limited strain coverage of existing vaccines. 
Principle of the test 
Total IgG antibody directed against specific microbial antigens is usually measured by 
ELISA. Reference ranges of antibody concentrations must be age-matched. Less is known 
about normal post-immunisation responsiveness and ranges obtained in immunisation 
studies using similar assay conditions are often adopted. 
Standardisation 
of assays 
is difficult. 
International 
standard 
sera with known 
concentrations of specific antibody for HiB and Tetanus toxoid are available. Bacterial 
antigens used 
in assays 
vary, with some 
laboratories 
using preparation 
of crude 
pneumococcal polysaccharides and other using pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide- 
depleted preparations. The latter are thought to measure truly protective antibodies only. 
Strain-specific pneumococcal antibody assays are not widely used as a test of immune 
function. They are most useful in the context of assessing vaccine efficacy in clinical trials. 
Interpretation 
Low levels of specific antibodies may indicate lack of exposure or impaired immune 
function. Levels of polysaccharide-specific antibodies are normally low until 5 years of age. 
If levels are low, immunisation with the relevant vaccine(s) followed by post-challenge 
testing at 3-4 weeks is indicated. Normal responsiveness is generally interpreted as 
a twofold or greater increase and antibody levels rising to the normal range. 
Pitfalls 
Difficulties interpreting these assays include: 
¢ 
Failure to compare test results with age-matched controls (especially important for 
polysaccharide antibodies). 
¢ 
Protection does not always equate with responsiveness. Levels of specific antibodies con- 
ferring protection are known for tetanus and HiB. This is not the case for pneumococcus. 
¢ 
Some patients make adequate antibody responses to challenge antigens but lose the 
antibodies quickly — for example, in splenectomised patients. Late follow-up of anti- 
body levels are indicated if this is suspected. 
327 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
Patients should not be revaccinated for the purpose of immune function testing unless 
microbe-specific antibodies are low. Inadvertent administration of vaccines to patients with 
high levels of antibodies is associated with a higher incidence of adverse reactions.

NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION TESTS 
In order to adequately protect us, neutrophils must be present in normal numbers, and 
must be able to:

Adhere to endothelium, using a variety of adhesion molecules, at the site of inflammation. 
¢ 
Traverse the endothelium and follow a gradient of chemoattractant to the site of 
inflammation. 
@ 
Phagocytose organisms/cellular debris causing inflammation. 
¢ 
Undergo a respiratory burst, generating toxic chemicals to kill ingested pathogens. 
Clinical testing of neutrophil function attempts to test each of these functions.

Infections with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Burkholderia cepacia 
Family history of a neutrophil disorder 
Failure of separation of the umbilical cord. 
¢$¢¢ 
¢ 
NB: Neutrophil function testing is difficult and time consuming, and these tests should 
never be performed without detailed discussion with a clinical immunologist. Neutrophil 
defects are extremely rare, however several factors may interfere with the assays giving mis- 
leading results. These factors include intercurrent infection and drug therapy. Additionally, 
common causes of the above infections including diabetes should be excluded initially. 
- 
Principle of the test 
328 
Quantification of neutrophils 
Neutrophils are routinely quantified in the five-part white 
cell differential count obtained from haematology analysers. An apparently low neutrophil 
count should always be confirmed by examining a blood film. 
Prior to considering neutrophil function testing, a blood film should be performed to 
assess neutrophil morphology, as neutrophils that appear abnormal rarely function nor- 
mally. Rare genetic abnormalities of neutrophil granulation as well as myelodysplasia 
(a premalignant condition in which neutrophil development and function is abnormal) can 
readily be recognised on a blood film. In these conditions formal neutrophil testing rarely 
adds to the management of the patient. 
Interpr 
Pitfalls 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY 
Adhesion 
Measurement of key neutrophil adhesion molecules, using standard flow 
cytometry techniques, is commonly used. The adhesion molecules which may be measured 
in this way include CD15 — sialyl Lewis x, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c and CD18. 
Neutrophil adhesion assays involve allowing neutrophils to adhere to plastic, fibronectin 
coated glass or cultured endothelium. Unbound neutrophils are washed away and the 
adherent neutrophils quantified either by microscopy or measurement of a neutrophil 
specific protein such as myeloperoxidase. 
Chemotaxis 
Neutrophil chemotaxis (migration in response to chemotactic stimuli) 
may be measured under agarose. Wells cut into agarose are filled with neutrophils, 
chemoattractant or control saline, and the numbers of cells migrating after a defined period 
are counted. A control is always included and the results are compared with age-matched 
controls. Alternatively, specialised Boyden chambers may be used. 
Phagocytosis 
Phagocytosis of organisms is measured using latex particles or stained 
organisms incubated with patient cells. The percentage of cells that have ingested particles 
and the number of particles ingested is compared to controls. If fluorescent particles are 
used, phagocytosis can be measured by flow cytometry. In both assays distinguishing adher- 
ent particles on the cell surface from those that have been phagocytosed is difficult. 
Respiratory burst 
The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test relies on reduction of NBT to 
formazan by oxygen radicals produced by stimulated neutrophils. Neutrophils are incu- 
bated with colourless NBT, appropriately stimulated and the presence of formazan is 
assessed visually using a microscope or by spectrophotometry. Intracellular dyes, which 
become fluorescent after reduction by reactive oxygen intermediates, have led to flow cyto- 
metric equivalents of the NBT test. 
etation 
Interpretation of neutrophil function tests is difficult and requires an interpretive report by 
the supervising immunologist. 
Repeated absence of the neutrophil respiratory burst is seen in chronic granulomatous 
disease (CGD). Partial reduction may be seen in carriers of this condition. 
Absence of neutrophil adhesion molecules or significant reduction compared with 
age-matched controls is seen in leucocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). 
¢ 
Neutrophil function 
testing should be performed when patients 
are 
well, as 
intercurrent infections and a variety of drugs can impair neutrophil function. 
¢ 
These tests are highly variable, even within the normal population. Additionally 
normal values are age-related in many assays. Hence establishing a normal range is 
difficult. 
* 
Neutrophil function changes progressively after venepuncture and purification of 
neutrophils. Therefore, blood must be sent directly to the testing laboratory. 
¢ 
Usually if tests are abnormal, repeat testing will be suggested as well as confirmatory 
protein or genetic testing. 
NK CELLS 
NK cells are part of the innate immune response to viral infections. In routine practice 
assessment is usually limited to quantification of these cells, however assays of NK cell 
function are well described although not widely available. 
329 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
Clinical indications 
NK cell deficiency states are extremely rare. Patients who have been described have 
recurrent viral infections, particularly caused by herpes viruses. Infections are extremely 
severe in the first few days, but subsequently resolve (as the adaptive cellular response takes 
over). 
Principle of the test 
NK cell numbers are measured by flow cytometry after staining for CD16 (an FcR 
expressed on all NK cells) often in combination with other NK markers such as CD56 or 
CD57 (each of which stain a subset of NK cells). Cell numbers, however, do not correlate 
well with activity. 
NK cell activity is only measured in rare cases. An erythroblastic cell line K562 is 
susceptible to lysis by NK cells. Prelabelling these cells with °'Cr allows the degree of target 
cell death to be assessed by chromium release. 
Interpretation and pitfalls 
330 
Age-related ranges for assessment of NK cell numbers are available. As NK cell numbers 
fluctuate, low measurements should be tested repeatedly to exclude artifactual reductions. 
NK cell function assays are not well established. The significance of any abnormal findings 
must be cautiously interpreted in the light of repeated testing of several controls. 
Abnormal Immunoglobulins 
Proliferation of a single population (clone) of B cells may result in excessive production of 
immunoglobulin (Ig) of a single specificity. The resulting Ig product is a monoclonal 
protein, also known as a paraprotein. Paraproteins may be fragments of or intact Ig. 
Moroclonal Ig light chain in urine is known as Bence-Jones protein (BJP). Marked activa- 
tion of a small number of B cell populations may result in the production of more than one 
paraprotein and is described as an oligoclonal response.

TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
Detection of paraprotein in these conditions is supportive of the diagnosis provided other 
typical features are present. 
¢ 
Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) — is diagnosed only if 
other causes of paraprotein are excluded. Monitoring is essential as some evolve into 
multiple myeloma. 
¢ 
Small paraproteins arise in a variety of states associated with immune activation. They 
include: 
— 
Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) 
— 
Severe infections 
— 
Post bone marrow transplantation (BMT). 
Monoclonal or oligoclonal paraproteins are seen, especially when there is underlying 
immunodeficiency. Measurement of paraprotein while not essential is informative of the 
degree and pattern of immune activation. 
Principle of the test 
Detection of paraproteins 
332 
Electrophoresis 
Electrophoresis (in an appropriate support medium) separates proteins in 
body fluids according 
to surface charge. Application 
of protein-binding 
dyes to 
electrophoresed material allows visualisation of separated proteins. Besides paraprotein 
detection, electrophoresis is useful in many other conditions where variation in protein levels 
can be qualitatively demonstrated (e.g. hypo- and hypergammaglobulinaemia, acute phase 
response, protein-losing states such as nephrotic syndrome and protein-deficiency states 
such as a-1-antitrypsin deficiency) (Figure 3.12.1). 
All immunoglobulin molecules have a common structure, but minor variations in size and 
electrical charge distinguish immunoglobulin molecules of one specificity from immunoglob- 
ulins of all other specificities. Immunoglobulin molecules normally move to the negative 
pole — the gamma (y) region — under standard electrophoresis conditions. The minor varia- 
tions in charge of different immunoglobulins results in a ‘smear’ in the y-region representing 
the huge number of differing specificities of immunoglobulin in normal individuals. However, 
in situations where a single B cell clone is producing excessive amounts of monoclonal 
immunoglobulin, a band results. This is how paraproteins are most commonly identified. 
Densitometry 
This technique is used to measure the amount of paraprotein present. 
The absorbance of transmitted light by the dye—protein complexes on the electrophoretic 
strip is directly proportional to the amount of protein present in each region. Measurement 
of total protein allows the concentration of the paraprotein to be calculated. 
Immunofixation 
This is the method most commonly used to ‘type’ paraproteins 
(Ig heavy/light chain composition). Serial lanes of electrophoresed material are overlaid with 
isotype and light chain specific anti-sera. Following a washing step, only protein bound by 
antisera remains. Visualisation is as for standard electrophoresis. 
Other tests in paraproteinaemic states: 
* 
Serum B)-microglobulin is a valuable indicator of myeloma tumour burden and can be 
measured by a variety of immunochemical methods. Renal impairment reduces the rate 
of B)-microglobulin excretion so levels should be adjusted to take account of this. 
¢ 
Hyperviscosity is a feature of some paraproteinaemic states, especially Waldenstrém’s 
macroglobulinaemia 
(IgM paraprotein), 
but also some IgA and IgG3 multiple 
myelomas. Viscosity is measured using a capillary tube system (viscometer) in which

interpretation 
The prevalence of serum paraprotein detection increases with age. This finding occurs in 
<0.1% of young adults, 3% of 70 year olds and 10% of 80 year olds. The critical issue is 
to differentiate paraproteins associated with malignant conditions such as multiple 
myeloma from MGUS and benign conditions. 
The significance of a serum paraprotein is assessed using these indicators. 
¢ 
Amount — small concentrations of paraproteins (<10g/l) are typical of non-malignant 
conditions such as MGUS, infection, CTDs and post-BMT, and in these conditions the 
concentration of paraprotein rarely increases progressively. Larger amounts of para- 
proteins occur in malignant conditions like multiple myeloma and Waldenstrém’s 
macroglobulinaemia. 
* 
Other immunoglobulins 
— 
suppression 
of the non-paraprotein immunoglobulins 
(immunoparesis) is a characteristic feature of malignant paraprotein states but rarely 
occurs in MGUS (<5% of cases). 
¢ 
Urinary monoclonal light chain bands (Bence—Jones proteins (BJPs)) — BJPs are character- 
istic of malignant paraprotein states, particularly multiple myeloma. This finding is rare in 
non-malignant conditions. 
* 
Other features — haematological (Hb, bone marrow findings), biochemical (renal 
parameters, serum calcium), and X-ray findings (osteoporosis and lytic changes) 
should be taken into account when assessing the likely cause of a paraprotein. 
¢ 
Immunoglobulin-related abnormalities — hyperviscosity (due to physico-chemical char- 
acteristics of the paraprotein) occurs in malignant paraprotein states but not in MGUS. 
333 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
Pitfalls 
¢ 
Urinary paraproteins do not react with protein-detecting urine dip-sticks. Negative 
urinalysis for protein does not rule out the presence of BJPs. 
¢ 
 Paraproteins may lie anywhere on the electrophoretic strip but are usually in the B or 
Y regions. 
¢ 
Serum, not plasma should be used. Fibrinogen in plasma forms a band in the B region. 
Other protein bands (complement components and CRP) can also mimic paraproteins. 
¢ 
The sensitivity of some electrophoretic techniques used for urine paraprotein detection 
will require that concentrated urine (an early morning sample) or a 24-h collection is 
provided. Check local arrangements. 
¢ 
Some paraproteins polymerise resulting in a few rather than a single band on 
electrophoresis. This is especially common with IgA and IgM proteins. 
¢ 
Light chains only are produced in 15% of multiple myeloma cases. Serum paraproteins 
are rarely detected in such cases as the low-molecular weight light chains are readily 
excreted in urine. Therefore, paired serum and urine specimens are required for 
myeloma screening. 
¢ 
Detection of monoclonal light chain only in serum requires immunofixation for IgD 
and IgE heavy chains to detect these rare myelomas. If only heavy chains are found on 
immunofixation, different light chain anti-sera should be used in an attempt to iden- 
tify monoclonal light chains. Addition of McClelland reagent (dithiothreotol) may 
unfold paraproteins (particularly IgA) of abnormal conformation, allowing access of 
the light chain antiserum to a previously masked light chain. Myeloma with unusual 
light chains that bind poorly to standard light chain antisera is far more common than 
heavy chain diseases. 
* 
Immunoglobulin concentrations calculated using densitometry are not directly compa- 
rable with those calculated using immunochemical methods. Estimation of the con- 
centration of non-paraprotein Ig of the same isotype as the paraprotein must not be 
calculated by subtracting the densitometry result from the immunochemical result. 
* 
Some conditions such as paraprotein-related neuropathies are associated with very low 
levels of paraprotein. The more sensitive technique of immunofixation is indicated in 
such cases even when paraprotein is not evident on electrophoresis. 
DETECTION AND MEASUREMENT OF CRYOGLOBULINS 
Immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold are called cryoglobulins..Cryoglobulins that 
precipitate at higher temperatures are more likely to cause clinical problems. 
Clinical indications 
= 
* 
Cutaneous vasculitis 
¢ 
Glomerulonephritis associated with normal C3 and reduced C4 levels 
¢ 
Cold-related symptoms such as Raynaud’s phenomenon, especially if there is evidence 
of vasculitis 
¢ 
 Cold-induced inflammatory states 
¢ 
Vasculitis in the presence of known precipitant of cryoglobulin formation 
(e.g. 
Hepatitis C virus; B cell malignancy). 
Principle of the test 
Correct handling of blood is critical. Blood should be taken using a pre-warmed syringe, 
put into a pre-warmed plain tube, transported to the laboratory, and allowed to clot at 
334 
ABNORMAL IMMUNOGLOBULINS 
37°C. Serum is then placed in a series of clear tubes that are left at ambient temperatures 
of 4°C (cold room), 20°C (room temperature) and 37°C (warm room or warm water bath) 
for 2-3 days. Most cryoglobulins of clinical significance will precipitate and be evident to 
the eye within 24 h but some form more slowly. Cryoglobulins formed at room tempera- 
ture and 4°C are more likely to be of clinical significance than those that form at 4°C only. 
Cryoprecipitate is quantified by centrifugation of the precipitate-containing serum in a 
graduated tube at 4°C and the ratio of precipitate to serum (cryocrit) is calculated. 
Typing requires definition of clonality and reactivity of the cryoglobulin. The precipitate 
is washed and re-dissolved in warmed buffer. Clonality is identified using electrophoresis 
and immunofixation at 37°C. Immunoglobulin isotype and rheumatoid factor (RF) activity 
must be measured at 37°C. Manual RID and agglutination methods are often used as 
nephelometry is difficult to perform at a defined temperature. 
interpretation 
Cryoglobulins are classified as follows: 
¢ 
Type 1 —- monoclonal cold-precipitating immunoglobulin (Ig), found in B cell malignancies 
(multiple myeloma, Waldenstr6m’s macroglobulinaemia and B cell lymphoma/leukaemias). 
@ 
Type 2 - cryoglobulinaemic monoclonal component that binds and precipitates 
polyclonal immunoglobulins — mixed cryoglobulin, usually with RF activity. It is seen 
in B cell malignancies, chronic infections — especially hepatitis C, chronic bacteraemic 
states and in connective tissue diseases (CTDs). 
@ 
Type 3 - cold-precipitating Ig with polyclonal RF activity. These occur in chronic 
infections and CTDs. 
Pitfalls 
¢ 
Failure to maintain the specimen at temperature of 37°C may result in loss of 
cryoglobulin from serum giving a false negative result. 
@ 
Serum should be left at 4°C for at least 3 days before reporting absence of a 
cryoglobulin. 
¢ 
 Cryoglobulins are not the same as cold agglutinins. The latter are antibodies that bind 
to red blood cells at low temperatures and that target bound cells for haemolysis. 
DETECTION OF OLIGOCLONAL BANDS IN CSF 
In health, the blood brain barrier prevents leakage of high-molecular weight proteins into 
the CSE, and immunoglobulin is not synthesised within the CSF. Intrathecal synthesis of 
immunoglobulin may occur in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as a variety of 
inflammatory CNS conditions. 
Clinical indications 
Suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) — intrathecal oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands are useful 
in diagnosis and prognosis. 
Principle of the test 
Highly sensitive methods such as nephelometry are required to measure levels of IgG and 
albumin in CSF, as concentrations are low. 
335 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMNUNOLOGY 
Intrathecal Ig synthesis is confirmed by isoelectric focusing (IEF). IEF is an elec- 
trophoretic technique where proteins are separated based on their isoelectric points, using 
gels containing ampholytes that form a pH gradient during electrophoresis. Proteins are 
sharply focused at the point in the gel where the pH equals their isoelectric point. The 
proteins are then transferred to nitrocellulose and detected using antisera to human IgG 
(immunoassay similar to immunoblotting). Serum and CSF are run together, and the 
presence of bands in the CSF, which are not detectable in serum, demonstrates intrathecal 
IgG synthesis. 
Interpretation 
Pitfalls 
336 
Albumin in the CSF reflects the passage of this protein from the blood to the CSF and levels 
increase if the blood brain barrier is leaky. CSF IgG may reflect passage of serum-derived pro- 
tein across the blood brain barrier or may indicate local intrathecal production. CSF IgG to 
albumin ratio is increased to >22% in patients with increased intrathecal production. 
The detection of oligoclonal bands supports a diagnosis of MS, but is also found in other 
neuro-inflammatory conditions. 
* 
Raised CSF IgG and CSF oligoclonal bands are not specific for MS. They are also seen 
in CNS sarcoidosis, neurosyphilis, bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis. 
¢ 
CSF oligoclonal bands are only considered positive when similar bands are absent in 
serum. 
* 
Oligoclonal bands cannot be interpreted in blood-stained CSF.

Detection of Antibodies and Antigen 
Angioedema: C1-Inhibitor 
Disorders 
C1-Inhibitor (C1-Inh) is a plasma protease inhibitor of the first component (C1) of the clas- 
sical pathway of complement activation. It is also an important control protein for coagu- 
lation, fibrinolytic and kinin pathways. Low levels of C1-Inh allow uncontrolled C1 
activation resulting in consumption of C2 and C4 (reduction in levels). In fluid phase acti- 
vation of Cls, levels of Cls, C3 and C5—C9 remain normal. Measurement of C1-Inh and 
C4 levels may be used to monitor disease activity. 
C1-Inh deficiency may be hereditary or acquired and results in angioedema. Diagnosis is 
made by demonstrating low levels of C1-Inh, functionally or antigenically. 
Clinical indications 
Recurrent bouts of acute local oedema of skin and mucosa, regardless of age. 
Recurrent bouts of crampy abdominal pain, if the C4 is low. 
Family history of hereditary angioedema (HAE). 
Monitoring response to treatment in patients with known C1-Inh deficiency. 
¢¢¢ 
¢ 
Principle of the test 
The diagnosis of, and distinction between, different types of hereditary and acquired 
angioedema can usually be established by measuring antigenic levels of C1-Inh, C1q, C3 
and C4 together with the clinical history. 
In a patient with angioedema: 
¢ 
 (C1-Inh deficiency is unlikely in the absence of a reduced level of C4. 
¢ 
Substantial reduction of C1-Inh levels, with reduced C4, reduced or normal Clq and 
normal C3, establishes the diagnosis of C1-Inh deficiency. Minor reductions in C1-Inh 
level may be due to complement consumption in immune complex disease. 
337 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
¢ 
A low C4 and normal levels of C3 should trigger measurement of C1-Inh function, 
even in the presence of normal or high antigenic levels of C1-Inh. This assay detects 
Type Il HAE. 
¢ 
A low Clq but normal C1-Inh level should lead to consideration of acquired anti-C1- 
Inh autoantibodies. 
Measurement of C1q, C4, C3 and C1-Inh levels 
The individual complement components are measured by RID or nephelometry. 
C1-Inh function assay 
C1-Inh function is assayed by measuring inhibition of the hydrolysis of amino acid esters 
by a standard preparation of C1s (an enzyme subunit of C1). Purified activated C1s catal- 
yses the chromogenic conversion of appropriate substrates, and this is measured by spec- 
trophotometry. Functionally active C1-Inh (normally present in fresh plasma or serum) 
inhibits C1s reducing the amount of colour produced. Results are expressed as a percent- 
age of Cls activity remaining in normal plasma. 
Detection of anti-C1-Inh antibody 
Measurement of these antibodies is not routinely performed, however when suspected 
based on complement studies, they can be demonstrated by immunoblotting or ELISA. 
Interpretation 
¢ 
Hereditary angioedema Type I (85% of cases) — functionally normal C1-Inh present in 
reduced amounts. C4 is low; C1q may be normal or low. 
¢ 
Hereditary angioedema Type II (15% of cases) — normal or elevated levels of inactive 
C1-Inh, but low C1-Inh activity. C4 is low, Clq may be normal or low. 
¢ 
Acquired angioedema Type I — levels of C1-Inh are reduced because of increased con- 
sumption, associated with lymphoproliferative disorders or connective tissue disease. 
C1-Inh, C1g and C4 are reduced. 
¢ 
Acquired angioedema Type II - characterised by the presence of an autoantibody 
directed against C1-Inh. This may prevent binding of C1-Inh to its substrate or facili- 
tate C1-Inh cleavage (inactivation) by proteinases activated in the inflammatory response 
including C1, plasmin and kallikrein. C1-Inh levels are variable (low or normal), with 
low levels of Clq and C4. 
Pitfalls 
¢ 
Cl-Inh is a labile protein and samples should be separated as soon as possible to avoid 
artifactual reduction. 
338 
ANGIOEDEMA: C1-INHIBITOR DISORDERS 
In vitro C1 activation may occur in poorly stored specimens, which will result in 
reduced functional activity of the inhibitor. 
Serum levels of C1-Inh are increased by exogenous androgens and related steroids, and 
reduced by exogenous oestrogens including oral contraceptives.

Allergy and Hypersensitivity 
Both laboratory and clinical testing procedures are used to investigate allergy and 
hypersensitivity disorders. The most frequently performed investigations are aimed at 
determining the cause of allergies, and do not need to be performed when symptoms are 
present. Measurement of mast cell tryptase and urinary methylhistamine during reactions 
helps to differentiate mast cell degranulation (usually due to Type I hypersensitivity) from 
other causes of ill health. 
_ TOTAL IgE LEVELS 
Clinical indications 
* 
Suspected allergic disease 
* 
Confirmation of atopic tendency 
¢ 
Useful in interpreting levels of allergen specific IgE. 
Principles of the test 
IgE is present in nanogram quantities in serum, and unlike other immunoglobulin isotypes 
cannot be detected by nephelometry. Solid phase assays using sensitive detection systems 
such as radioimmunoassays, enzyme immunoassays or fluorescence-based assays are used. 
IgE is captured by solid-phase bound anti-IgE, and after incubation and washing labelled 
anti-IgE is added followed by appropriate development or detection steps. 
Interpretation 
Reference ranges for total IgE levels are age-related. Elevated IgE is most commonly 
associated with atopy, but may also be seen in parasitic infections and Churg—Strauss 
syndrome. 
340 
ALLERGY AND HYPERSENSITIVITY 
Pitfalls 
Confirmation of an atopic tendency does not prove that symptoms are due to allergic 
disease. Severe allergy (usually to a single or few allergens) may be seen even with a normal 
or low total IgE. 
ALLERGEN-SPECIFIC IgE LEVELS 
Clinical indications 
Assessment of IgE-mediated allergy to specific allergens, suggested by history. 
Principles of the test 
Most laboratories use a similar system to that used to measure total IgE. However, the solid 
phase is coated with the allergen under investigation rather than anti-IgE. 
Interpretation 
Comparison of positive results with total IgE is useful. Most test systems report grades of 
positivity from 0 (negative) to 5 or 6 (strongly positive). Strongly positive results suggest 
significant sensitisation and are usually associated with symptoms. Negative results make 
clinical sensitivity unlikely, but do not absolutely exclude allergy. Intermediate grades must 
be interpreted with the total IgE and history. 
Pitfalls 
* 
Weak positives to many allergens are common in patients with grossly elevated total 
IgE. 
* 
Tests are expensive, and therefore it is usually only feasible to test for a limited range 
of allergens. 
* 
Range of allergens available is limited — particularly for investigation of drug allergy. 
¢ 
False negative results occur when major allergens are labile, or metabolites rather than 
a parent compound, or become denatured during coupling to solid phase. 
* 
Negative results do not absolutely exclude allergy — challenge tests remain necessary. 
ALLERGY SKIN TESTS 
Skin prick tests (SPTs) are widely used allergy investigations performed in the clinic. There 
are two main types — skin prick tests and intradermal tests. SPTs are more commonly used, 
as they are more comfortable for the patient, safer, quicker and easier to perform. 
Intradermal tests require injection of the allergen, which must be sterile. They are painful for 
the patient, carry a higher risk of provoking an allergic reaction and are more cumbersome 
to perform. However, they are more sensitive than SPTs and are used in specialist clinics 
particularly to investigate drug allergy. 
Clinical indications 
Investigation of allergic symptoms — a broad range of suspected allergens may be assessed. 
Results are read 15 min later, allowing immediate counselling of patients. 
341 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Principle of the test 
A drop of allergen solution is placed on the forearm, or injected into the skin. Negative 
control (diluent) and a positive control (histamine solution) are also used. For SPTs the 
drop of control or allergen is pricked with a lancet. Thus a small amount of allergen is 
introduced into the skin. If mast cells carrying allergen-specific IgE are present they are 
activated and degranulate, releasing histamine. Histamine causes 
a wheal and flare 
reaction. The diameter of the wheal is measured, and compared with controls. 
Interpretation 
Allergens producing a wheal 2-3 mm larger than the negative control are considered 
positive. Positivity indicates sensitisation to the allergen, but may not be associated with 
clinical symptoms. Larger reactions are more likely to be associated with symptoms. 
Positive results should be carefully reviewed together with the history to assess their clinical 
significance. 
Pitfalls 
¢ 
SPTs assess sensitisation, and do not imply clinical allergy to an allergen. 
# 
SPTs may miss sensitisation to labile allergens, or allergy to metabolites of a parent 
compound, which is often important in drug allergy. SPTs for labile components may be 
performed using a prick—prick technique, where a fresh fruit is pricked with the lancet, 
which is then used to prick the skin — however this technique is poorly standardised. 
@ 
<A negative SPT does not exclude allergy. 
¢ 
It may not be possible to carry out SPTs if the patient cannot stop antihistamines 
(which interfere with the tests), has extensive 
skin disease, has dermographism 
(where skin trauma induces a wheal) or where the risk of anaphylaxis is considered 
unacceptable. 
ALLERGEN CHALLENGES 
The gold standard in allergy diagnosis is the double-blind placebo-controlled allergen challenge 
(DBPCAC). This is most commonly used to investigate food and drug allergy, but may also be 
used to assess inhaled allergens. Where symptoms are subjective it is essential that challenges 
are performed in a double blind fashion. However, when objective signs predominate in the 
allergic reaction under investigation an open challenge may be appropriate. 
Clinical indications 
Assessment of specific allergy to staple foodstuff or essential drug. Performed under 
specialist supervision only, with appropriate resuscitation equipment. Risk of anaphylaxis 
must be considered acceptable. 
Principle of the test 
Escalating doses of allergen and placebo are prepared by dietician or pharmacist. Allergist 
performing test is unaware of contents. Numbered doses are administered to patient, and 
effects noted. Test is stopped if significant symptoms/signs of allergy emerge. Test results 
are unblinded and discussed with patient. 
342 
ALLERGY AND HYPERSENSITIVITY 
Interpretation 
Symptoms/signs 
resulting from placebo suggest psychogenic reaction. Reproducible 
symptoms/signs resulting from allergen prove allergy. 
Pitfalls 
* 
Carries significant risk of anaphylaxis 
* 
Can only be performed in patient who could tolerate severe reaction (no significant 
cardiac or respiratory disease, not on §-blockers) 
¢* 
Test is time consuming and requires specialised day care facilities and full resuscitation 
facilities 
¢* 
Co-factors such as infection, exercise, alcohol, etc. are not present — allergen may be 
missed. 
MAST CELL TRYPTASE 
Clinical indications 
Demonstration of mast cell degranulation in a patient — often useful to differentiate allergy 
to anaesthetic agent from other anaesthetic mishap. 
Principle of the test 
Mast cell degranulation is associated with release of mast cell tryptase. Elevated levels may 
be seen from 1 to 12 h after a systemic allergic reaction. Tryptase is measured using solid 
phase enzyme 
or radio-immunoassay. 
Pre-reaction serum when available should be 
analysed for comparison. 
Interpretation 
Elevated levels compared to baseline indicate mast cell degranulation. This is usually due 
to IgE-mediated reactions, however mast cell degranulation resulting from other stimuli 
cannot be excluded. 
Pitfalls 
Elevated tryptase is seen infrequently in allergic reactions due to food allergy. Failure to 
detect elevated tryptase does not exclude 
allergy. Appropriately timed samples are 
required for analysis. Test does not distinguish between allergy and other causes of mast 
cell degranulation. 
PRECIPITATING ANTIBODIES 
The majority of patients with extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) form precipitating anti- 
bodies to the allergen. The lung damage resulting from this condition results from both 
Type III and Type IV hypersensitivity. 
Common 
precipitating antibodies measured 
include antibodies 
to avian proteins 
(bird fanciers 
lung), Micropolyspora 
faenii (farmers lung) and aspergillus 
(allergic 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, ABPA). 
343 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Clinical indications 
¢ 
Suspected EAA (interstitial lung disease in exposed individual; fever, dyspnoea and/or 
cough on exposure to allergen). 
¢ 
Suspected ABPA 
(asthma, pulmonary 
infiltrates, 
bronchiectasis 
usually with 
eosinophilia). 
Principle of the test 
Antibodies to suspected allergen may be demonstrated by double diffusion (Ouchterlony 
plate) or by counter current immunoelectrophoresis (CCIE). 
Interpretation 
Positive test indicates sensitisation. Clinical significance must be interpreted in light of the 
history. 
Pitfalls 
Positive results support but do not establish the diagnosis of EAA. Positive results are com- 
mon following antigen exposure, even in the absence of disease. Tests are not 100% sensi- 
tive. CCIE is more sensitive than double diffusion.

Transplantation 
Tests used in transplantation include HLA typing of donor and recipient, detection and 
identification of anti-HLA antibodies and cross-matching which is the final test of com- 
patibility between an individual recipient and a particular donor. 
HLA-TYPING 
HLA-typing 
is performed 
on 
both donor 
and recipient 
before most 
types 
of 
transplantation. The number of HLA loci typed and the resolution required varies with 
the type of transplantation. For example in unrelated bone marrow transplantation high 
resolution typing of six loci (HLA-A, B, C, DR, DP and DQ) is routinely performed. In 
renal transplantation only three loci (HLA-A, B and DR) have routinely been typed, 
although recent data suggest that matching donor and recipient at more loci may improve 
outcome. 
There are many alleles of most HLA genes, some of which are very closely related, where 
the corresponding 
HLA protein differs by only one or a small number of amino acids. 
Traditional serological HLA-typing techniques are ‘low resolution’ and can only identify 
the broad HLA-types. Molecular techniques are required to delineate a ‘high resolution’ 
type in which many of the ‘splits’ of HLA antigens can be defined. Some alleles are so 
alike that routine molecular techniques cannot distinguish them — in these cases sequenc- 
ing of the variable portion of the HLA genes may be necessary to fully resolve the 
HLA-type. Some HLA genes can only be reliably typed using molecular techniques 
(e.g. HLA-DP). 
Methods of HLA-typing 
Serology was the first method described, and is still in use today. Sera containing antibodies 
to defined HLA-types are placed in wells in multiwell trays. Cells from the subject to be 
typed are added and incubated, following which guinea pig complement and later vital dyes 
are added. The dyes aid distinction of living and dead cells under the microscope. Each well 
345 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
is read and scored for the percentage of cells killed. By comparing the results from hundreds 
of wells, the HLA type can be deduced. Problems with this technique include limited 
availability of well-characterised sera, intensive labour requirements and subjective nature 
of interpretation. In comparison with more recently available molecular techniques, a sig- 
nificant error rate was identified, particularly typing HLA-DR. Additionally, failure to detect 
a weakly expressed second antigen leads to an erroneous assignment of a homozygous type, 
and on occasion a Class II type cannot be obtained using peripheral blood. 
Molecular typing techniques rely on PCR to amplify the DNA encoding the variable 
portion of HLA genes. Two main methods are used: 
Sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSOs) 
PCR primer pairs are specific for the gene to be 
typed, but not individual alleles. Following amplification PCR product is probed with several 
DNA probes and the HLA-type is determined by the pattern of probe binding. This technique 
is slow, but useful for typing several samples. It is useful for typing potential recipients and 
family members, in advance of a potential organ becoming available. 
Sequence specific polymorphism (SSP) 
SSP is a rapid technique, which can be used to 
type a donor. A large number of PCR primer pairs are used, with each pair including a 
type-specific primer, which will only amplify the gene for a particular HLA type, and 
a degenerate primer, which will bind all alleles of the HLA gene to be typed. This technique 
can be used for low resolution typing, or using a larger number of primer pairs for high 
resolution typing. 
Anti-HLA antibody screening and identification 
Detection 
and identification 
of anti-HLA 
antibodies 
is important 
in solid-organ 
transplantation. Anti-HLA antibodies may be produced following transplantation, trans- 
fusion or pregnancy. When anti-HLA antibodies are present, transplantation of an organ 
bearing these antigens may result in hyperacute rejection, with graft loss. Every effort is 
made to identify the specificity of anti-HLA antibodies to prevent delays when an organ 
becomes available. Only patients with no known antibodies to the donor HLA-type are 
assessed by cross-matching. 
' 
Methods for detection of anti-HLA antibodies 
346 
The earliest method described for detecting anti-HLA antibodies was complement dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) and which remains important today. Patients’ serum is incubated with 
a large panel (40+) of cells of known HLA-types. Guinea pig serum is added (as a source 
of complement), followed by vital dyes to facilitate distinction of living and dead cells. Each 
well is read to assess percentage cell kill. Presence of significant cell killing indicated the 
presence of antibodies to one or more of the HLA antigens expressed by cells in that well. 
Combining the results of several wells many anti-HLA antibodies can bé defined. The over- 
all level of sensitisation of a subject is expressed as the panel reactive antibody (PRA), 
which is the percentage of the cell panel killed by the patients’ sera. 
This technique detects only complement-fixing antibodies, and is relatively insensitive 
and labour-intensive. Additionally, non-HLA anti-lymphocyte antibodies interfere with the 
assay. Additional B cell preparations are needed to identify anti-HLA Class II antibodies. 
Newer methods of anti-HLA antibody detection include ELISA and flow cytometry. 
Commercial reagents are available in which HLA antigens are coated on the ELISA plate. 
These may be purified from platelets or other cells (and therefore include mixed antigens 
in each well) or may be highly purified (with a single antigen per well). ELISA techniques 
are quicker, more sensitive and detect both complement fixing and non-complement-fixing 
antibodies. 
TRANSPLANTATION 
Flow cytometry techniques have been adapted to detect anti-HLA antibodies, utilising 
either cell lines of known HLA type or beads coated with purified HLA antigens. Serum is 
incubated with cells or beads, and following washing FITC-conjugated anti-human antisera 
is added. The amount of antibody binding is assessed using flow cytometry, with fluorescence 
increased when antibody is present. 
Lymphocyte cross-matching 
Transplant threatening pre-formed anti-donor antibodies can often be identified in advance 
of an organ becoming available, and recipients with known antibodies against the donor 
HLA-type will not be considered for that donor. The final check, however, is to cross-match 
the donor and recipient to exclude the presence of previously unidentified anti-donor 
antibodies. The principle techniques used are CDC (with various enhancements to improve 
sensitivity) and flow cytometry. 
CDC cross-matching is performed using several of the potential recipient’s sera (Figure 
3.15.1). Sera following potentially sensitising episodes are included, as antibody levels can 
wax and wane. This panel of sera is incubated with donor cells (usually B and T cells 
purified from lymph node or spleen), followed by guinea pig serum and vital dyes. Cell 
killing is assessed, and the absence of cell killing indicates absence of anti-donor antibody. 
Cell killing, however, 
indicates 
that anti-donor antibody 
or other anti-lymphocyte 
antibodies are present. 
Flow cytometry is a more sensitive technique where donor cells are incubated with potential 
recipient’s sera, washed and then incubated with FITC-conjugated antiserum to human

indicates the absence of anti-donor antibody (i.e. the transplant can proceed) or increased

Immunophenotyping 
Leukaemias and Lymphomas 
Accurate diagnosis of leukaemias and lymphomas is dependent on integrated analysis of: 
* 
Cell morphology (microscopic appearance) 
¢ 
Enzyme expression (TdT — lymphoid; peroxidase/esterase — myeloid; TRAP — hairy 
cells etc.) 
* 
Cytogenetic and molecular mutation profiles (chromosomal number; translocation 
analysis — t9:22-Bcr/Abl — chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML); t14:18 — IgH/ Bcl-2 - 
follicular lymphoma etc.). 
In addition to: 
¢ 
Immunophenotyping — monoclonal antibodies specific for known antigens are used to 
‘tag’ antigen-expressing cells. A variety of detection systems (fluorescence, immuno- 
chemical) are used to identify labelled cells. This is commonly referred to as cell marker 
analysis. Flow cytometry facilitates the analysis of multiple antigen expression in large 
numbers of cells over a short time. This technique has revolutionised leukaemia/ 
lymphoma diagnosis and classification. 
TISSUES AND TECHNIQUES USED 
Immunophenotyping may be performed on any tissue or body fluid. In practice, flow 
cytometric analysis is frequently performed on peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate 
specimens and occasionally using disaggregated lymph nodes. 
Test requirements are as follows: 
¢ 
 Anticoagulated samples (heparinised/EDTA) — red cell lysis or mononuclear cell enrich- 
ment techniques are used to enhance white cell analysis. 
@ 
Absolute white cell differential count (same sample). 
¢ 
Blood film/BM slides from fresh sample for review of the morphology of the cell of 
interest is essential for planning the most appropriate phenotypic analysis. 
349° 
TECHNIQUES AND TESTS IN CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
Old samples are not suitable — ideally analyse within 4h of sampling. This is especially 
important if the malignancy is of probable blast or activated cell origin. 
Tissues like lymph nodes can be disaggregated and single-cell suspensions analysed by 
flow cytometry. More often, sections of tissue are immuno-stained using MAb-based 
immunohistochemical methods. The range of antigens that may be detected with formalin- 
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues is limited, as tissue processing alters antigenic structures. 
Frozen tissues are preferred for this reason. Comparison of the immuno-stained slides with 
routine histological analysis is always necessary. 
Uses of immunophenotyping 
350 
Lineage identification 
Lymphoid 
— 
B/T/NK; non-lymphoid 
— 
myeloid, erythroid, 
megakaryocytic, etc. This is especially important in conditions where blasts are prominent 
and differentiation pathways are not clear from morphology — for example, distinguishing 
lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma from undifferentiated AML -— Mo (Figure 3.16.2). 
More detailed marker analysis for precise classification is dictated by the initial lineage 
profile. Non-haematological lymphoreticular infiltrates are distinguishable from blood 
malignancies using appropriate immunocytochemical stains. 
Stage of differentiation 
Malignant blood cells correlate with a distinct stage in the 
differentiation process. Analysis of multiple marker expression helps to clarify the approx- 
imate stage from which the malignant clone has evolved (Figure 3.16.1). The correlation is 
not always exact, however. Some malignant cells express inappropriate/‘aberrant’ antigens 
for the lineage or stage of morphological differentiation. 
Distinct patterns of marker expression are identified for many haematological malignancies. 
No universal diagnostic cell marker panel is currently recommended. Specialist laboratories 
will advise on profiles undertaken locally. It is never justifiable to depend on marker analysis 
alone for diagnosis. Correlation with morphology, other diagnostic techniques and of 
course with the clinical features is always essential. 
Clonality 
Morphology or CD marker expression may not be adequately discriminating 
to confirm lymphoid malignancy. Demonstration of monoclonality in a suspect cell popu- 
lation can greatly aid diagnosis. B cells will express either k- or \-light chain, but not both. 
Sole expression of one type of light chain is highly predictive of malignancy. Demonstration 
of T cell monoclonality is less straightforward. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed 
against specific families of TCR (e.g. VB analysis) can be used. DNA-based PCR clonality 
analysis of antigen receptor sequences from suspected malignant lymphoid cells is useful, 
sensitive and increasingly available. Monoclonal populations will have a single antigen 
receptor rearrangement pattern. Non-malignant populations have multiple. 
Prognosis 
Management, responsiveness and outlook of haematological malignancies 
is highly variable. Immunophenotyping has enhanced the precision with which individual 
conditions are diagnosed. This improves planning of specific therapy and prediction of 
outlook. In some haematological malignancies, the pattern of expression of certain cell 
markers is associated with poor prognosis. CDS positivity is usual in CLL. Loss of expres- 
sion occurs in some patients undergoing transformation to a more aggressive state. CD38 
and FMC-7 expression in CLL correlates with poor prognosis. 
Minimal 
residual 
disease 
Detection 
of residual 
disease 
is important 
both 
for 
identification of patients requiring more intensive therapy or for early detection of relapse 
in patients in remission. Monitoring for low-level disease activity using flow cytometric 
immunophenotyping is highly sensitive (1 per 10* cells approximately). Molecular assays 
for malignancy-related transformations (e.g. PCR for Philadelphia chromosome, monoclonality

Direct Immunofluorescence 
Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is a technique for assessing deposition of immunoreactants 
in tissues. This technique is part of the routine investigation of renal and selected skin biop- 
sies. However, DIF may be applied to other tissues on an experimental basis. In general DIF 
is of value when diseases characterised by Type II or Type III hypersensitivity are suspected. 
PRINCIPLE OF THE TEST 
Normal histological fixation techniques degrade complement and some epitopes on 
immunoglobulins, therefore fresh tissue samples must be submitted to the laboratory. The 
tissue is rapidly frozen and cut into thin sections. Sections are incubated with FITC- 
conjugated antibodies to selected immunoreactants. Immunoreactants examined usually 
include C3, IgA, IgG and IgM, however the panel may be extended to include C4, 
fibrin, k and X, at least in selected cases. Following incubation, unbound antibody is 
washed away, the slide mounted and staining pattern assessed by fluorescence microscopy. 
As immunofluorescence slides fade with time, positive findings are photographed to 
provide a permanent record. 
_ INTERPRETATION 
Slides are interpreted by a trained pathologist and the immunofluorescence pattern must be 
interpreted in the context of the morphology in the biopsy (Figure 3.17.1). In general, direct 
binding of antibody to tissue (Type II hypersensitivity) results in linear staining with 
immunoglobulin, with or without complement deposits. Examples include anti-GBM dis- 
ease in the kidney and pemphigus in the skin. Deposition of immune complexes (ICs) (Type 
III hypersensitivity) generally results in a granular pattern of positivity. Examples include 
membranous nephropathy in the kidney and vascular immune complex deposits in immune 
complex vasculitis (e.g. SLE).

bullous pemphigoid, (e) mesangial IgA in IgA nephropathy and (f) IgG binding in glomerular basement 
membrane disease. See Plate Section for colour reproduction of these images. 
PITFALLS 
Some immunoreactants are relatively rapidly degraded. Biopsies must be taken directly to 
the laboratory for processing. Classical findings in many skin diseases are dependent on a 
biopsy taken from the correct site and at the correct time. Optimum biopsy sites for some 
common conditions are outlined in Table 3.17.1. 
False negative results may be seen in many skin conditions and it is usually advisable to 
request appropriate serology at the time of biopsy, as this may be sufficient to confirm a 
diagnosis in the presence of typical histology, even if DIF is negative.

Which of the following statements are true? 
All monoclonal antibodies are monospecific. 
Antibodies are routinely conjugated to enzymes, isotopes and fluorescent tags, for use in 
diagnostic assays. 
Batch-to-batch variation is a significant problem when using polyclonal antibodies, but rarely 
a problem with monoclonal reagents. 
FITC-conjugated antibodies are only used for flow cytometry. 
Production of monoclonal antibodies relies on immortalisation of spleen cells from a 
vaccinated rodent. 
Agglutination techniques can be used to differentiate between different isotypes of antibody. 
Flow cytometry can only be used to measure cell surface protein expression. 
Nephelometry is a robust technique which can be automated and produce results rapidly. 
Immunoblotting can be used to investigate novel antibody systems. 
DIF is a useful method to test for autoantibodies in serum. 
Rheumatoid factors are found in approximately 90% of patients with RA and are specific for 
this condition. 
Anti-ribosomal P-protein antibodies are quite specific for SLE. 
Patients with polymyositis who are anti-Jo-1 positive have a high incidence of interstitial lung 
disease. 
Negative anti-cardiolipin antibodies exclude the anti-phospholipid syndrome. 
Most C-ANCA positivity is due to anti-PR3 antibodies, and over 60% of P-ANCA positivity 
is due to antibodies against myeloperoxidase. 
Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies play a pathogenic role in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. 
Multiple autoimmune endocrine diseases are frequently found in the same patients. 
The titre of antiepidermal basement membrane antibodies does not correlate with disease 
activity. 
Anti-GBM is the commonest cause of pulmonary-renal syndrome (haemopytysis with acute 
renal failure). 
The presence of anti-GM1 is relatively specific for GBS. 
- 
Complement deficiency is unlikely if C3 and C4 levels are normal. 
T cell proliferation assays are useful in monitoring HIV infection. 
Normal levels of IgG, IgA and IgM indicate normal humoral immunity. 
A blood film should always be examined prior to performing neutrophil function testing. 
A paraprotein can be accurately quantified by measuring the Ig isotype involved using 
nephelometry. 
Absence of a serum paraprotein excludes a diagnosis of MM. 
Serum paraproteins are rarely found in patients with solitary plasmacytomas. 
BJPs are monoclonal free light chains, found in urine. 
Normal Ig levels exclude the presence of a paraprotein. 
Negative urinalysis for protein excludes the presence of BJPs. 
SELF ASSESSMENT 
A negative test for nut-specific IgE excludes nut allergy, and the patient can safely resume 
consumption of nuts. 
Allergen-specific IgE cannot be detected if the patient is taking anti-histamines. 
A normal total IgE excludes allergy. 
Double-blinded placebo-controlled food or drug challenge is the most reliable way to exclude 
a food or drug allergy. 
Mast cell tryptase is usually elevated during an anaphylactic reaction, and is useful to distinguish 
drug allergy from other accidents during general anaesthesia. 
Cross-matching is used to identify the specificities of anti-HLA antibodies in potential 
recipient’s sera. 
Complement-dependent cytotoxicity is a technique which can be modified for use in HLA 
typing, anti-HLA antibody screening, and identification and cross-matching. 
PCR-based techniques are superior to serological methods for HLA-typing at the HLA-DR 
locus. 
High resolution typing is routinely performed in all types of transplantation. 
Anti-HLA antibodies to a donor’s HLA type predict that the cross-match with a particular 
donor will be positive. 
Immunophenotyping using flow cytometry can be performed on lymph nodes. 
Morphology is the most reliable diagnostic method routinely used to differentiate myeloid 
from T and B cell leukaemias. 
A single T cell marker and B cell marker can be used to establish the lineage of a leukaemia. 
Flow cytometry is equally useful in determining clonality of B and T cell leukaemias. 
Aberrant antigen expression is useful when detecting minimal residual disease. 
DIF is useful in the diagnosis of conditions due to Type IV hypersensitivity reactions. 
DIF can be performed on tissue which has been placed in formalin. 
Antibody binding to tissue components is associated with linear positivity, while immune 
complex deposition is associated with a granular pattern. 
3.10d. 
DIF patterns must be assessed together with routine histology.

TREATMENT OF 
IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
INTRODUCTION 
This part describes some agents commonly used to treat immunological disorders. It is not 
interided to replace pharmacology and therapeutics texts, but rather to provide an overview. 
It is also hoped that immunotherapeutics will make more sense after gaining an understanding 
of clinical immunology in the earlier parts of this book.

Principles of 
Immunosuppression 
The immune system plays a vital role in protection against infection and malignancy. 
Therefore, the potential benefits of treating a patient with immunosuppression must be 
assessed in the context of the associated risks. Not all patients with immunological diseases 
are treated with immunosuppression. Patients with apparently similar conditions may 
require different treatment regimens. Decisions on appropriate therapies may be based on 
evidence provided by controlled trials in common disorders. However, when treating 
uncommon disorders evidence is often lacking. Therapy may be based on knowledge of the 
immunological mechanisms of the disease and the mechanisms of action of immunosup- 
pressive agents. The following units outline different immunosuppressive drugs in common 
use. This parts outlines the broad principles to consider when choosing an immuno- 
suppressive regimen for an individual patient. 
WHO REQUIRES IMMUNOSUPPRESSION? 
Patients with active, immune-mediated disease where suppression of the immune process is 
necessary to restore or improve health. The form of immunosuppression must be chosen on 
evidence of efficacy or likely efficacy, given the mechanism of action of the therapeutic 
agent and the pathogenesis of the condition to be treated. Criteria for assessing disease 
activity and monitoring of response to therapy are critically important. Therapeutic options 
other than immunosuppression may be preferable (e.g. hormone replacement in auto- 
immune endocrinopathies). Burnt-out disease where organ dysfunction is due to scarring 
will not respond to immunosuppression. 
_ WHICH AGENTS? 
High quality, randomised controlled trials of different treatment regimens may provide 
evidence to guide therapy. However, where evidence is lacking knowledge of the underlying 
mechanism of disease and natural history of the condition directs treatment decisions. 
363 
TREATMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
Drugs are chosen 
to inhibit the appropriate 
part(s) of the immune system. Some 
immunosuppressive agents take weeks to produce therapeutic effects and are not adequate 
where organ damage progresses rapidly. 
MINIMISING DOSE AND DURATION OF 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION 
The risks of opportunistic infection and malignancy are related to both intensity and duration 
of immunosuppression. To minimise these risks the least toxic agent likely to be effective is 
chosen, the lowest dose likely to be effective is used, and powerful toxic agents such as 
cyclophosphamide are substituted with less toxic agents such as azathioprine as soon as 
possible. Dose reduction supervised by experienced clinicians minimises the duration of 
immunosuppression. However, overzealous tapering of immunosuppression may result in 
relapse and exposure of patients to greater cumulative doses of drugs. 
PATIENT MONITORING 
Patients 
are monitored 
for their response 
to therapy and anticipated 
side effects. 
Monitoring disease avoids over or under immunosuppression. Early detection and treatment 
of relapses may result in lower cumulative exposure 
to immunosuppression. Many 
immunosuppressive drugs have haematological, hepatic or renal side effects and monitoring 
for toxicity is required. Cyclosporin and tacrolimus levels are monitored in transplantation; 
however levels are less helpful in other conditions where the optimal target levels remain 
to be established. 
APPROPRIATE PROPHYLAXIS 
Many patients require long-term immunosuppression with regimens that are ‘associated with 
predictable toxicity. Appropriate prophylaxis should be considered when therapy is being 
initiated. For example, PCP prophylaxis is indicated in patients requiring cyclophos- 
phamide, and osteoporosis prophylaxis is routine in patients requiring chronic steroid 
therapy. 
PATIENT EDUCATION 
364 
Compliance with treatment is higher when patients understand their treatments and the 
reasons for taking each drug. Additionally, patients must be aware of side effects and 
understand the significance of febrile illnesses or possible infection. Patients need to be 
aware of the importance of reporting mouth ulcers or abnormal bleeding (early symptoms 
of leucopaenia or thrombocytopaenia) immediately when marrow suppression is a risk. 
Patients should also be aware of the importance of participation in screening programmes 
(e.g. cervical smears) as well as UV avoidance to minimise the risk of skin cancers. 
Corticosteroids 
BACKGROUND 
The structure and function of corticosteroids (steroids) resemble cortisol, 
a hormone 
secreted by the adrenal cortex. Cortisol (hydrocortisone) has many different actions, 
including mobilisation of glucose stores (glucocorticoid effects), maintenance of blood 
pressure control (mineralocorticoid effects) and suppression of inflammation. Cortisol 
protects the body during stressful events such as trauma, surgery and infection where 
baseline levels increase more than 10-fold. 
Many different corticosteroids 
are used for their anti-inflammatory effects. Anti- 
inflammatory activity is related to glucocorticoid effects and agents with a high ratio of 
glucocorticoid to mineralocorticoid activity are widely used in inflammatory diseases. 
Prednisolone is the most commonly used oral steroid, while hydrocortisone or methyl- 
prednisolone are given intravenously. Steroid agents are available for local administration 
to the skin, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Hydrocortisone is used for replace- 
ment therapy in adrenal and pituitary failure, where endogenous steroid production is 
inadequate. 
INDICATIONS FOR USE 
Steroids are used to control inflammation in many different settings. These include: 
¢ 
Post-organ transplantation — prevention and treatment of organ rejection 
* 
Connective tissue diseases — for example, SLE; vasculitides and RA 
¢ 
Autoimmune diseases — immune haematological diseases — ITP and autoimmune 
haemolytic 
anaemia; 
chronic 
active 
hepatitis; 
pemphigus; 
some 
types 
of 
glomerulonephritis 
¢ 
Allergic inflammation — for example, asthma; atopic eczema; allergic rhinitis; acute 
allergic reactions 
365 
TREATMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
Case 4.2.1 Steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome 
A 10-year-old girl presented with progressive swelling 
of her ankles, and facial 
puffiness. Investigations showed proteinuria (++++), low serum albumin and 
raised cholesterol. 24-hour urine protein was 5 g/24 hours. A diagnosis of nephrotic 
syndrome probably due to minimal change disease was made. Steroid therapy was 
started and within 2 weeks proteinuria was less then 1 g/24 hours. After one month 
proteinuria had fully resolved and steroids were tapered. Unfortunately proteinuria 
quickly recurred. 
Steroid therapy was restarted, remission achieved and steroids tailored again. 
Nephrotic syndrome recurred and a renal biopsy confirmed the clinical diagnosis of 
minimal change glomerulonephritis, ruling out alternative causes 
of nephrotic 
syndrome. At this stage, the child was Cushingoid, growth had fallen from the 
20th to the 3rd centile and glucose tolerance was impaired. 
A diagnosis of steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome, complicated by iatrogenic 
Cushing’s syndrome was made. Steroid therapy was restarted to gain remission, with 
cyclosporin initially adjusting the dose based on blood levels. Steroids were success- 
fully withdrawn. The dose of cyclosporin was slowly decreased until proteinuria 
recurred. The cyclosporin dose was slightly increased to achieve remission, and this 
dose was maintained. One year later the child remained in remission, on cyclosporin 
therapy.

Malignancies — for example, treatment of leukaemias and lymphomas; intracerebral pres- 
sure reduction in brain malignancies. 
MECHANISMS OF ACTION 
The mechanisms by which steroids suppress inflammation include: 
Sd 
Monocyte 
effects 
— 
impaired maturation 
to macrophages. 
Reduced 
antigen 
uptake and processing. Inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-a) is 
diminished. 
Lymphocyte effects — impaired cytokine production reducing proliferative responses 
and functional activity (one of the most important anti-inflammatory mechanisms of 
steroid therapy). Impaired recirculation causing lymphopaenia. High doses kill lym- 
phocytes by apoptosis. 
eee inhibition — inhibition of COX enzymes and of membrane phospholipid 
release. 
ADMINISTERING STEROIDS 
The dosage, route and duration of use of steroid medications are dependent on the clinical 
indication. Steroid therapy regimes are well established in many disease states and readers 
are referred to individual units for more information.

ADVERSE EFFECTS 
Prolonged use of steroids or use of high doses for more than a short time (7 days) exposes 
patients to many potential adverse effects. Side effects can be categorised into: 
¢ 
Exaggeration of physiological action of steroids 
¢ 
Suppression of endogenous steroid production with relative steroid insufficiency dur- 
ing stress. 
STEROID PRESCRIBING 
Before initiating steroid therapy the following points should be noted: 
¢ 
Consider the benefit and risks of steroid therapy and plan therapy accordingly. Use a 
safe, effective, non-steroid option if available. 
¢ 
Consider objectives of therapy and plan dose and duration of treatment accordingly — 
the initial dose should achieve control and dose should be reduced to the lowest 
possible effective dose as rapidly as possible. 
367 
TREATMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
368 
Local administration (e.g. airway inhalation, application to skin or rectum) is preferred 
to systemic administration if possible. The side-effect profile is much less severe than 
with systemic steroid therapies. However, high dose inhaled steroids may cause 
impaired growth in children. 
Steroids are best administered in the morning, or on alternative days to limit effects on 
endogenous steroid production. 
Agents are 
not interchangeable and have different anti-inflammatory potencies 
(strengths). An equivalency chart is available in the British National Formulary (BNF), 
however equivalence values are approximate and vary in different clinical situations. 
Enteric-coated steroids may be erratically absorbed. In general, non-coated preparations 
are preferred if tolerated. 
Gastric and bone protection should be considered in patients at risk of peptic ulceration 
or osteoporosis, particularly in patients requiring long-term therapy. Bone density 
monitoring is indicated in patients receiving long-term therapy. 
Patients should be aware of increased steroid requirements during stress (which persists 
after cessation of steroid therapy), and the dangers of abrupt cessation of therapy. All 
healthcare providers should be aware of the history of steroid use. 
Vigilance regarding infection, especially chicken pox and tuberculosis (TB) is important 
for patients and doctors. 
Patients should be advised to carry a ‘steroid user card’ or an alert pendant to provide 
information in an emergency.

Immunosuppression (I) 
The drugs outlined in this section work primarily by inhibiting proliferation of lymphocytes. 
These agents affect T cell responses and B cell proliferation to varying degrees. Many of the 
side effects are due to anti-proliferative effects on other rapidly dividing cells in the body. 
The main differences are in potency and toxicity. 
AZATHIOPRINE 
First synthesised in 1961, this agent is widely used in transplantation and autoimmune dis- 
ease, where it may allow substantial reduction of steroid dosage. The parent drug is inac- 
tive until metabolized in the liver to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). It is a moderately potent 
alkylating agent, whose major mechanism of action is inhibiting conversion of inosine to 
adenosine, leading to cellular adenosine depletion and impaired proliferation. 
Azathioprine is usually administered orally. Many side effects of azathioprine are due to 
non-specific inhibition of proliferation, especially in the bone marrow. Patient education 
and monitoring of full blood count (FBC) and liver function tests allow early detection of 
dose-related bone marrow suppression and idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Other side effects 
include nausea, hypersensitivity reactions and hair loss. There is an increased susceptibity 
to infection and increased risk of malignancy, especially skin cancer. If severe nausea pre- 
cludes the use of azathioprine, 6-MP may be tolerated. 
METHOTREXATE 
Methotrexate (MTX) interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking a critical folate pathway 
enzyme. It inhibits cell proliferation. It is used in large doses for the treatment of malignant 
conditions including some leukaemias. Bone marrow suppression, liver dysfunction and 
mucositis are common adverse side effects. Moderate doses given either by the oral or intra- 
muscular routes are used with benefit in a number of immune-mediated conditions includ- 
ing rheumatoid disease and severe psoriasis. Gradual dose elevation from an initially small 
369 
TREATMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
dose is undertaken once tolerance is ensured. It is important to note that MTX used in these 
settings is administered once weekly rather than daily. Inadvertent prescribing errors are 
well documented and result in critical bone marrow suppression and often death. Such 
unfortunate cases require admission to units where expert management of the bone 
marrow aplasia can be given. Folinic acid is given as a rescue treatment and works by 
by-passing the metabolic step inhibited by MTX. 
All patients receiving MTX must be aware of the potential side effects and their likely 
presentations. Liver and pulmonary adverse effects are well documented in addition to the 
bone marrow effects. Careful and regular monitoring of the FBC and liver function tests 
(LFTs) is mandatory. Patients should be advised not to drink alcohol while taking this drug. 
MTX is associated with development of a pneumonitis which is an indication for immedi- 
ate cessation. Before treatment, formal pulmonary function assessment 
is performed. 
Regular clinical and functional assessments allow early detection of pneumonitis. 
MYCOPHENYLATE MOFETIL 
Mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) has recently been licensed for prophylaxis of acute renal 
and cardiac transplant rejection. MMF is a specific, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine 
monophosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the de novo pathway of purine synthesis. 
Lymphocytes are highly dependent on the de novo pathway, and unlike most other cells 
cannot utilise the salvage pathway (which allows recycling of purine bases). Therefore, the 
anti-proliferative effect of MMF shows some lymphocyte specificity. 
Dose-related 
gastrointestinal 
intolerance 
is common. 
Potential 
bone marrow 
suppression requires FBC monitoring, as well as patient education to recognise signs of pos- 
sible bone marrow suppression (infections, fevers, mouth ulcers, bruising or unexplained 
bleeding). Infection is more commonly seen than with azathioprine, and increased incidence 
of malignancy is also reported. Hypersensitivity reactions and many other side effects have 
been reported. 
The therapeutic effect of MMF appears superior to azathioprine, particularly in suppres- 
sion of humoral immune responses. Although this agent is not yet licensed for use in 
autoimmune disease, many trials and case reports describing successful use in SLE and 
other antibody-mediated disorders have been published. 
CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE 
370 
Cyclophosphamide (CP) is an alkylating agent, which is widely used in cancer treatment. At 
lower doses it is used as a potent, but toxic immunosuppressive drug. CP cross-links DNA, 
inhibiting cell proliferation. This effect is not lymphocyte-specific and severe toxicity may 
be seen in other rapidly dividing cells. Its use is generally reserved for life-threatening or 
organ-threatening immunological diseases. 
Administration is by a daily oral dose or pulse IV doses usually given monthly. Dose 
reduction may be needed in the elderly, or in severe renal or hepatic impairment. 
Bone marrow suppression is commonly seen. Regular monitoring together with patient 
education reduce the associated risks. Haemorrhagic cystitis results from irritation of blad- 
der epithelium by a CP metabolite, acrolein. Bladder protection by hydration or use of a 
drug called mesna reduces the risk of haemorrhagic cystitis. CP is generally less hepatotoxic 
than azathioprine, however alopaecia is seen more commonly. Prolonged treatment with 
CP may lead to both male and female infertility. Susceptibility to infection is marked, and 
prophylaxis against PCP is recommended. CP carries a significant risk of secondary cancers 
developing several years following therapy.

371 
Immunosuppression (Il) 
The agents described in this section suppress T cell responses predominantly. The oldest agent 
cyclosporin A, introduced in 1980, dramatically improved the results of renal transplantation 
and allowed the development of liver, heart and lung transplantation. 
 CYCLOSPORIN 
Cyclosporin binds cyclophilin and inhibits activation of T lymphocytes by preventing the 
production of IL-2 and some other early T cell activation genes. It is a lipid-soluble drug, 
metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4. Cyclosporin is widely used as part of triple therapy 
(with steroids and azathioprine or mycophenylate) in solid organ transplantation. It is also 
used to prevent GVHD following bone marrow transplantation, for severe resistant atopic 
dermatitis and asthma, aplastic anaemia and occasionally in severe autoimmune disorders. 
Two preparations are available - Sandimmune and Neoral. These are not interchangeable 
due to significant differences in bioavailability. In transplantation cyclosporin dosage is 
monitored by drug level measurement. Traditionally, this has been based on the trough 
level, however a 2-hour peak level may be preferable. In autoimmunity, the appropriate 
target level has not been defined, and so monitoring is aimed at preventing nephrotoxicity. 
Blood pressure and creatinine levels are maintained within predefined limits (usually 
creatinine should remain within 30% of pre-treatment values). 
f 
Cyclosporin interacts with many drugs, including over the counter therapies and herbal 
remedies. Patients must be warned about this and monitoring increased when additional ther- 
apies are required. The most serious side effect is nephropathy, which causes renal failure in 
over 10% of recipients of non-renal solid organ transplants. Other common side effects 
include hypertension, infection, impaired glucose metabolism, tremor, gastrointestinal (GI) 
disturbances, gingival hypertrophy, hirsutism, malignancies and neurological disorders. 
TACROLIMUS 
Tacrolimus (FK506) binds to FKBP-12 (FK binding protein-12) in cells, and inhibits T cell 
activation by a mechanism identical to cyclosporin. Absorption is bile-independent. Acute

rejection rates in most solid organ transplants are lower with tacrolimus than with cyclosporin, 
however graft survival appears to be improved only in liver and intestinal transplants. Use 
of tacrolimus in autoimmune disease has not been extensively studied. Topical tacrolimus 
has recently become available for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). 
The side effect profile is similar to cyclosporin with nephropathy being a major problem. 
Diabetogenic potential may be greater than cyclosporin, however gingival hypertrophy and 
hirsutism do not occur. Dosage of tacrolimus is monitored by drug-level measurement. 
RAPAMYCIN (SIROLIMUS) 
Rapamycin binds to TOR (target of rapamycin) and this complex binds FKBP-12, however the 
mechanism of action is distinct from Tacrolimus. Rapamycin inhibits cytokine-mediated sig- 
nalling in late G1 phase, and blocks the action of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6. Rapamycin is a potent 
inhibitor of T cell responses, but also inhibits B cell responses and smooth muscle proliferation 
(potentially important in chronic rejection). Rapamycin is used in solid organ transplantation. 
Rapamycin absorption is impaired by fatty food, and the drug is metabolised in the liver 
by CYP3A4. Because of this there is a clinically significant interaction with cyclosporin. 
Rapamycin dosage is guided by drug levels. Rapamycin is not nephrotoxic. Principal side 
effects include severe arthralgia, hyperlipidaemia and impaired wound healing. 
Of interest, rapamycin does not inhibit induction of tolerance in animal studies, whereas 
cyclosporin and tacrolimus do. In the future, this may become an important property.

Therapeutic Antibody 
Production 
Antibody-based therapies are increasingly used in a growing spectrum of clinical conditions. 
Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are used therapeutically. Antibodies raised in 
other species are foreign proteins, and may produce an antibody response when adminis- 
tered therapeutically. Immunogenicity has limited the repeated use of these agents in chronic 
disease. In the last decade, reshaped antibodies have been produced, in an attempt to limit 
immunogenicity. Principles of antibody production are described in this section; subsequent 
sections describe routine use of some therapeutic antibodies. 
Therapeutic uses of antibodies include: 
Prevention of infectious disease 
Neutralisation of toxins 
Prevention of rhesus alloimmunisation 
Immunomodulation 
Treatment of malignancy 
T cell depletion of bone marrow for transplantation.

POLYCLONAL ANTIBODIES 
374 
Most antigens stimulate multiple lymphocytes as part of the normal immune response. 
Antibodies produced in such responses are polyclonal. Well-established techniques are 
available for isolation and purification of specific antibodies from plasma. Therapeutic 
antibodies may be purified from human plasma or raised in animals (usually rabbits or 
horses). Production of polyclonal antibodies is described in Section 3.2. There are stringent 
manufacturing requirements to ensure quality, purity and sterility of antibodies produced 
for therapeutic use. 
Therapeutic polyclonal antibodies of human origin include: 
¢ 
Concentrated 
preparations 
of rhesus 
antibodies, 
used 
to 
prevent 
rhesus 
alloimmunisation (Section 4.7). 
THERAPEUTIC ANTIBODY PRODUCTION 
* 
Pathogen-specific antibody concentrates (hyper-immune globulins) used as post-exposure 
prophylaxis (e.g. Varicella-Zoster and Hepatitis B). 
Therapeutic polyclonal antibodies of animal origin include: 
* 
 Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) used in solid organ transplant rejection therapy 
¢ 
Tetanus immune globulin for neutralisation of tetanus toxin. 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES (MAbs) 
Production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) is described in Section 3.2. Besides antibody- 
based therapeutic agents, MAbs have also revolutionised laboratory procedures. The 
importance of MAbs is reflected in the award of a Nobel Prize to Kohler and Milstein, the 
scientists who described the technique of MAb production in 1975. 
The major advantages of MAbs over polyclonal antibodies include: 
¢ 
Production quantities — near-limitless amounts of antibody can be produced with stable 
activity over long periods of time. 
* 
Specificity — antibody specificity remains stable. Monoclonal does not necessarily 
imply monospecificity. However, high-affinity antibodies without clinically relevant 
cross-reactivities are chosen as therapeutic agents. 
* 
Consistency — batch-to-batch variation is rarely seen, unlike polyclonal antibody 
preparations. 
Theoretically, MAbs could be generated using cells from any animal, however rodents are 
the only species in which hybridomas are produced with a high success rate. The overall 
structure of mouse immunoglobulin is similar, but not identical, to human immunoglobulin. 
This poses two problems in relation to in vivo use. 
¢ 
Adverse reactions — antibody production against ‘foreign’ components can cause 
systemic reactions of varying severity. Fc effector components of MAbs may also trigger 
generalised immune activation with similar effects. 
* 
Loss of efficacy — ‘anti-antibodies’ induced against species-specific components of 
MAbs can also impair antibody persistence and function with reducing efficacy with 
repeated use. 
RESHAPED MAbs 
Production of human MAbs is technically challenging but continues to be a goal. However, 
using DNA technology, chimeric and humanised MAbs have been produced and used as 
therapeutic agents (Figure 4.5.1). 
Chimeric antibodies are produced by introducing the gene segments encoding the vari- 
able parts of both the heavy and light chains of the rodent MAb of interest into the corre- 
sponding human immunoglobulin genes. The resulting antibody is predominantly human, but 
still contains a significant amount of rodent protein. Approximately, 10% of human recip- 
ients of such antibodies will make human-anti-chimeric antibodies (HACAs). HACAs may 
inhibit antibody function. Development of antibodies is less common in patients who are 
receiving concomitant immunosuppression. Serum sickness reactions are rarely problematic. 
Humanised antibodies were developed to further decrease the amount of rodent protein 
included in therapeutic antibodies. These antibodies are produced by grafting the hypervariable 
regions of both heavy and light chains onto the framework of a human immunoglobulin gene.

Bispecific antibody 
Although relatively little rodent protein remains, production of HACAs still occurs. There is a 
greater risk of losing antibody specificity during the protein engineering stage with this process 
compared with making the more straightforward chimeric protein. 
Other types of engineered molecules have been produced or are in development. For 
example, receptors can be fused to portions of antibody molecules. This prolongs the half- 
life of several molecules and has been used to produce a TNF receptor-IgG protein and 
CTLA-4-IgG hybrid. Bispecific antibodies have also been produced where the heavy and 
light chains of two different molecules are joined. This produces an antibody with two dif- 
ferent antigen-binding sites, and could be used to direct drugs, gene therapy vectors or cells 
to tumours or other targets.

Targeted Cell Depletion 
Several biological reagents have been developed in an attempt to deplete specific cells of the 
immune 
system, 
to facilitate more 
potent 
or more 
specific immunosuppression. 
Heterologous polyclonal antibodies, heterologous monoclonal antibodies and humanised 
monoclonal antibodies are in routine use. This section describes some licensed cell depleting 
therapies, however a large number of antibodies are currently in clinical trials. 
A common side effect of all depleting antibodies is the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). 
This occurs as a result of cytokine release from activated lymphocytes and monocytes. 
Typical clinical features include fevers, chills and rigors, rash, musculoskeletal pain, bron- 
chospasm, dyspnoea and hypotension. CRS is usually most severe after the first infusion, 
becoming less severe with subsequent infusions. 
ANTI-THYMOCYTE GLOBULIN 
Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is a polyclonal heterologous antiserum, produced by 
immunising rabbits or horses with human T cells or a human T cell line. It is used in com- 
bination with other immunosuppressive drugs to prevent organ rejection and aplastic 
anaemia. In solid organ transplantation, ATG is used as prophylaxis in high-risk patients, 
or to treat steroid-resistant rejection. 
Since ATG is a polyclonal product, there are differences between preparations, and even 
different batches from the same manufacturer. ATG depletes cells both by cytotoxicity and 
opsonisation, which results in removal of antibody-coated cells by the reticulo-endothelial 
system. Additionally, by binding to a number of cell surface molecules, ATG may inhibit 
function of the residual cells. Effectiveness may be monitored by measuring absolute T cell 
counts. 
ATG is diluted and infused into a large vessel over several hours. Premedication with 
steroids and antihistamines reduces the incidence of systemic side effects. ATG is con- 
traindicated in patients with allergy to rabbit (or horse) proteins, severe thrombocytopaenia, 
active infection or during pregnancy. Prior to administration, a skin test is used to rule out 
allergy to the heterologous antiserum. Side effects include CRS, anaphylactic reactions

TREATMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
Case 4.6.1 Steroid-resistant renal transplant rejection 
A 39-year-old man received a second cadaveric renal transplant. He went into renal 
failure at the age of 25, because of anti-GBM (glomerular basement membrane) disease. 
He was originally treated with haemodialysis, and received three blood transfusions 
because of severe haemoptysis. Unfortunately he produced anti-HLA antibodies. He 
went on the transplant waiting list when he was 28, and anti-GBM had not been 
detectable for 2 years. Because of the anti-HLA antibodies he waited 3 years to 
receive a cross-match negative kidney. Following the first transplant he developed 
two episodes of rejection, which responded to steroids. Unfortunately the graft failed 
after 8 years. He waited a further three years on haemodialysis before receiving the 
current kidney. He was immunosuppressed with tacrolimus, azathioprine and steroids. 
The kidney did not function for the first few days and he required two dialysis 
treatments. 
However, 
he then began producing 
urine and creatinine 
fell to 
100 pmol/l. He was discharged after two weeks. Six weeks after his transplant, he 
developed severe gastroenteritis. Two days later he felt unwell with temperatures and 
a painful graft. He was admitted to hospital and his creatinine was 300 pmol/l. 
| 
Tacrolimus was undetectable. Kidney biopsy showed severe acute cellular rejection. 
It was thought that this might have occurred because of inadequate immunosup- 
pression during the episode of gastroenteritis. He was treated with a three-day course 
of intravenous methylprednisolone, and creatinine fell to 200 mmol/l. However, it 
subsequently rose to 350 pmol/l. Repeat biopsy showed worsening rejection. A 
course of anti-thymocyte globulin was given to reduce the number of anti-donor 
T cells present. During the 10-day course of treatment his T cell count dropped and 
creatinine gradually fell to 130 wmol/l. He was discharged on stronger maintenance 
therapy of tacrolimus, mycophenylate and steroids.

(Type I hypersensitivity) and serum sickness after 8-14 days (Type III hypersensitivity). If a 
second course of ATG is required, antiserum from an alternative species should be chosen. 
If a second course is given from the same species there is a high risk of hypersensitivity and 
skin test results must be closely examined. The progress of T cell depletion, which can be 
impaired by neutralising antibodies, should be monitored. 
MUROMONAB-CD3 (OKT3) 
378 
Muromonab-CD3 (commonly known as OKT3) is a murine monoclonal antibody against 
CD3, used to treat acute rejection (usually steroid-resistant rejection) of renal, hepatic and 
cardiac transplant patients. 
Muromonab-CD3 results in depletion of T cells, leading to marked inhibition of cellu- 
lar immune responses. Established B cell responses are not affected, however T cell help for 
TARGETED CELL DEPLETION 
B cell maturation is inhibited. The effectiveness of treatment can be monitored using 
absolute T cell counts. 
Muromonab-CD3 
is administered 
as 
a daily bolus injection for 10-14 days. 
Methylprednisolone is given prior to the first dose to reduce the incidence and severity of the 
CRS, which occurs in most patients after the first dose. 
Muromonab-CD3 
is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to mouse 
products, have anti-mouse 
titres of >1: 1000, uncompensated heart failure or fluid 
overload, a history of seizures or in patients who are pregnant/breastfeeding. 
Side-effects 
of muromonab-CD3 
include anaphylaxis which may be difficult 
to 
differentiate from CRS, neuro-psychiatric events as well as complications of immunosup- 
pression (infection, neoplasia and viral-induced lymphoproliferative disorders). Repeated 
treatment with muromonab-CD3 carries a risk of allergic reactions and inhibition by 
neutralising antibodies. 
RITUXIMAB (ANTI-CD20) 
Rituximab is a humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody licensed for the treatment of 
chemotherapy-resistant follicular lymphoma. It has also been used in some antibody-mediated 
autoimmune diseases. 
Rituximab is a cytotoxic antibody that binds to and depletes CD20-positive B cells. 
Plasma cells are CD20 negative, and are not depleted. Rituximab inhibits B cell maturation 
and may reduce autoantibody levels. Cellular immunity is not directly affected. However, 
B cells can present antigen to activated or memory T cells, so an indirect effect appears 
likely. 
Rituximab is administered as an infusion, once weekly for 4 weeks. An analgesic and 
antihistamine, with corticosteroids are given pre-infusion. Repeated courses of treatment 
can be given, as humanisation of antibody reduces immunogenicity. 
Side effects include infusion reactions (including CRS) and leucopaenia. Tumour pain and 
tumour lysis syndrome may also occur in patients with a high tumour burden. 
CAMPATH-1H (ANTI-CD52) 
Campath-1H is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a 
cell surface molecule, expressed on T and B cells and at low levels on NK cells. It is licensed 
for treatment of resistant B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Campath-1H has 
also been used for other lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune cytopaenias, RA, and induction 
therapy for renal transplantation. 
Campath-1H depletes T and B cells im vivo and in vitro, inhibiting both cellular and 
humoral responses. B cell depletion lasts several months and T cell cytopaenia, persists for 
over a year. NK cell numbers fall temporarily, but usually recover in weeks. 
Campath-1H is given as an intravenous infusion, usually after premedication with 
paracetamol and an antihistamine. Prophylaxis against herpes infections and Pneumocystis 
carinii is recommended. 
Infusion-related side effects are commonly seen and are typical of CRS. Prolonged 
haematological toxicity and infections also occur. 
Campath-1H is also used in vitro to T cell deplete bone marrow and other sources of 
stem cells.

New depleting antibodies that target specific cell populations in the immune system are 
under development, including antibodies to CD25, which are specific for activated 
lymphocytes. Additionally, non-immunological applications of targeted cell depletion 
include antibody-induced eradication of breast cancer cells that overexpress a growth 
factor receptor called herseptin.

In addition to cell-depletion, therapeutic administration of antibodies is routinely used to:

A further application of antibody therapy currently in clinical trials is treatment of allergic

PREVENTION OF ALLOIMMUNISATION 
—- ANTI-D(Rho) 
IMMUNOGLOBULIN 
A major success of antibody therapy is the virtual elimination of haemolytic disease of the 
newborn (HDN) in the developed world. Rh— women develop antibodies to Rhesus- 
positive (Rh+) RBCs following transfusion or transplacental transfer of Rh+ cells. 
Following alloimmunisation, HDN can complicate subsequent pregnancies. HDN is a 
profound alloimmune haemolytic anaemia due to transplacental passage of maternal anti- 
bodies. This results in severe anaemia, congestive heart failure, generalised oedema (hydrops 
fetalis) and even intrauterine death. Prevention of alloimmunisation of Rh— mothers has 
made HDN a rare condition, usually involving rare blood group incompatibilities. 
Anti-D is a human immunoglobulin solution, prepared using donors who have made 
high titres of anti-D antibodies following transfusion or previous pregnancies. 
Anti-D is administered to non-sensitised Rh— women to remove Rh+ fetal cells before 
an immune response is generated. The antibody is given within 72 hours of interventions 
associated with possible transplacental passage of foetal cells (miscarriage, amniocentesis, 
other intrauterine procedures, termination and following delivery). Additionally, routine 
antenatal prophylaxis is recommended, with antibody given at 28 weeks and 34 weeks. 
Prevention of sensitisation is essential as once sensitisation occurs, it cannot be reversed. 
381 
TREATMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
PREVENTION OF INFECTION 
The ability of antibody to neutralise toxins and organisms is exploited to prevent several 
infectious diseases. Antibodies used include human hyperimmune globulin, equine serum 
and humanised MAbs. 
Indications include exposure to: 
¢ 
Tetanus — the causative toxin can be neutralised by antibodies. Human hyperimmune 
serum is given following a high-risk injury in non-immune patients. 
¢ 
Hepatitis B — the risk of infection is reduced by neutralising antibodies, which inhibit 
viral entry into cells. Human hyperimmune serum 
is administered after high-risk 
exposure in non-immune individuals. 
* 
Varicella zoster (VZV) — in non-immune, immunocompromised or pregnant patients, pri- 
mary infection can be fatal. Neutralising antibodies can reduce the risk of infection as well 
as the severity. Specific VZV immunoglobulin, or batches of intravenous immunoglobulin 
known to have high anti-VZV titres may be used post-exposure in high-risk groups. 
¢ 
Cytomegalovirus — infection in immunosuppressed patients can cause severe disease. 
Immunoglobulin treatment was widely used as prophylaxis, however antiviral agents 
like gancyclovir are now used more commonly. 
¢ 
Hepatitis A — immunoglobulin can be used in immunocompromised individuals, follow- 
ing exposure or prior to travel. Vaccination is preferred in immunocompetent individuals. 
¢ 
Rabies and botulism — equine antibodies given post exposure may be of value in these 
life-threatening infections. 
¢ 
Respiratory syncitial virus — RSV causes bronchiolitis in young children, and severe 
illness in children born prematurely, particularly if they have had bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia. Palivizumab, a humanised neutralizing MAb, can be administered monthly 
during the RSV season to reduce the risk of infection. 
IMMUNOMODULATION 
Cytokine activity can be inhibited by antibodies as well as soluble cytokine receptors or 
naturally occurring antagonists. Fusion proteins can be constructed, binding receptors to 
immunoglobulin Fe fragments, to increase the half-life of receptor molecules. Both TNF-a 
and IL-1 activity may be modified in this way. 
TNF-a plays a pivotal role in many inflammatory conditions, and is intimately involved 
in granuloma formation. However, TNF also protects against infection. 
Infliximab is a humanised MAb, which inhibits TNF, and etanercept is a TNF receptor 
grafted onto an IgG molecule. Anti-TNF therapy is used in rheumatoid disease, Crohn’s 
disease and juvenile arthritis. Not surprisingly, severe infections are an important side 
effect, and reactivation of tuberculosis is a particular problem. Demyelinating disease of the 
CNS as well as occasional reports of SLE have been reported. Etanercept has also been 
associated with serious blood disorders. 
IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-1. IL-1 is a 
cytokine produced early following infection, and in many inflammatory disorders. Anakinra 
(recombinant IL-1ra) is used in the treatment of severe rheumatoid disease. Severe infection, 
particularly in patients with asthma and neutropaenia are important side effects. 
TREATMENT OF ENVENOMATION AND POISONING

as therapeutic tools. Antisera to snake venom are specific for venom produced by different

OTHER ANTIBODY THERAPIES 
Case 4.7.1 Crohn’s disease 
A 20-year-old student presented with a 3-month history of fatigue and weightloss and 
a three-week history of bloody diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Colonoscopy showed 
discontinuous inflammation and biopsies showed granulomatous inflammation. 
Small bowel follow-through showed extensive inflammation in the small bowel. 
A diagnosis of Crohn’s disease was made. Initial treatment with steroids and 
mesalazine produced a partial remission. However, 2 months later, despite this 
therapy the patient deteriorated. In an attempt to avert surgical resection of the 
colon, a trial of anti-TNF therapy was given. 
The patient received three infusions of infliximab ovef a 6-week period with dramatic 
improvement. Azathioprine was also instituted both to treat the underlying Crohn’s 
disease, and also to reduce the risk of developing anti-chimeric antibodies. Steroids were 
tapered and remission was maintained using mesalazine and azathioprine. 
species of snake. European venom viper antiserum is indicated for severe viper envenomation, 
particularly in small children and the elderly, where there is a small risk of fatality. Antiserum 
is used for systemic reactions and severe local reactions that extend rapidly. 
Antibody fragments 
to digitalis 
are 
used in severe 
digitalis overdosage, where 
discontinuing digitalis and correction of electrolyte abnormalities 
are insufficient 
to 
stabilise the patient. The use of antibody fragments improves penetration to tissues. 
ANTI-IgE — 
A NOVEL APPROACH TO TREATING 
ALLERGIC DISEASE 
Type I hypersensitivity reactions result from mast cell activation through IgE bound to 
high-affinity IgE receptors on the cell surface. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the 
portion of the IgE molecule bound by the high-affinity IgE receptors prevent sensitisation 
of the mast cells without cross-linking cell-bound IgE. Anti-IgE therapy reduces severity of 
allergic rhinitis and asthma. Additionally, in patients with severe food allergies, anti-IgE 
increases the threshold at which reactions occur. While this would not allow return to a 
normal diet, the risks associated with accidental ingestion of traces of allergen may be 
greatly reduced.

Immunoglobulin Replacement 
Therapy 
Immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrates are prepared from pooled plasma donations from 
1000-10,000 individuals. Careful donor screening, strict regulation and quality control of 
production, and additional anti-viral treatment of Ig concentrate, produces a very safe 
product. Ig contains predominantly IgG with variable levels of IgA contamination. A num- 
ber of products are commercially available. Early preparations were for intramuscular 
administration (IMIg). Dosage was limited by pain at injection sites and side effects were 
common. Products suitable for intravenous use (IVIg) available since the 1980s are now 
widely used. Products for subcutaneous administration are also available. Ig prepared for 
different routes of administration, and even different IVIg products are net interchange- 
able. Ig is extremely expensive and supply is limited worldwide. Therefore, it is critical that 
its use is reserved for cases where it is clearly indicated. Clinical immunologists should be 
consulted prior to use outside the indications outlined in the following paragraph. 
INDICATIONS FOR IVIg THERAPY 
Primary antibody deficiency syndromes 
IVIg is recommended therapy in CVID, XLA, CD40L deficiency, other severe genetic 
antibody deficiencies. Its value in IgG subclass deficiency and specific antibody deficiency 
is less clear. Trial use for a 12-month period may be useful. Temporary use in symptomatic 
transient hypogammaglobulinaemia of infancy may be useful. 
Secondary antibody deficiency syndromes 
384 
IVIg is of value in patients with antibody deficiency associated with multiple myeloma and 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Benefit of IVIg is most marked in those patients with a his- 
tory of pyogenic infection or where low specific antibody levels and poor vaccine responses 
are demonstrated. IVIg is also used following bone marrow transplantation until immune 
reconstitution occurs. 
Ig REPLACEMENT THERAPY 
Case 4.8.1 X-linked agammaglobulinaemia 
A 2-year-old boy presented with recurrent chest infections and chronic diarrhoea. He 
had been well until the age of 6 months, following which he developed chest, and ear 
infections. One month prior to presentation, he developed diarrhoea, which had 
improved but not fully resolved. Stool examination showed Giardia lamblia. He was 
treated with metronidazole. Immunoglobulins (Igs) showed undetectable IgG and 
IgA with low levels of IgM. No B cells were detected in peripheral blood, suggesting 
a diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). The diagnosis was confirmed 
by demonstrating absence of btk, and a mutation was identified in the btk gene. 
Intravenous immunoglobulin replacement was commenced and infections became 
infrequent. The family sought genetic advice and was counselled that future sons had 
a 50% risk of being affected. The families were keen to have the patient’s older sister 
tested for carrier status. However, the geneticist advised against testing, as this 
information is of no benefit to a child. In line with guidelines on genetic testing of 
healthy children, predictive carrier testing for the daughter was deferred, with advice 
that testing could be discussed with the daughter when she would be mature enough 
to make her own decision. 
T cell mediated immunodeficiencies 
IVIg is indicated in SCID and CID syndromes where impaired antibody-mediated immunity 
is demonstrated. 
ADMINISTRATION 
Large doses of IVIg can be administered and normal levels of IgG achieved. Adverse 
reactions with IVIg are rare, provided care is taken with patient preparation and infusion. 
The average dose for replacement purposes is 0.4 g/kg every 3 weeks (half-life of IgG 
is 21 days). Doses and/or frequency of infusion are increased if patients do not reach 
normal levels of IgG after approximately 3 months of treatment. The IVIg requirement 
may be increased if infection is inadequately treated, with co-existent protein-losing 
states and rarely with hypercatabolism of Ig. Protein-losing states without associated 
immunodeficiency rarely require Ig replacement, despite low IgG levels. Subcutaneous 
administration of Ig can be useful where venous access is a problem. Intramuscular Ig is no 
longer used. 
Initial therapy should be undertaken in a hospital setting, supervised by personnel familiar 
with IVIg therapy. Home therapy is an option for some patients and is organised by 
specialist centres that select, prepare and support patients. 
Patient screening is required prior to first infusion. This includes: 
Pre-infusion IgG level 
Hepatitis virus screen (especially HCV) 
Renal and liver biochemistry 
FBC 
Infection screen

¢ 
Written, informed consent covering administration, side effects and potential long-term 
risks of use of this blood product. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Acute adverse reactions are most common with the first infusion of a particular IVIg product 
and are rare once treatment is established. Mild reactions cause headache, shivering, muscle 
aching and fever with severe reactions characterised by respiratory embarrassment, chest 
pain, hypotension, collapse and occasionally death. Symptoms occur during or within 
24 hours of infusion and are usually due to immune complex formation. Causes include too 
rapid an infusion rate or untreated infection. 
Guidelines to lessen the risk of reaction include: 
Initiate infusions at rates slower than manufacturers’ recommendations 
Adequate treatment of infection prior to infusion 
Administer hydrocortisone and antihistamine before the first few infusions 
Do not change products unless absolutely essential. 
¢¢¢ 
¢ 
Most reactions settle on slowing or stopping the infusion. Paracetamol is helpful for mild 
reactions. Antihistamine and adrenaline may be required for more severe reactions. 
Antibody-deficient 
patients with complete IgA deficiency may develop anti-IgA 
antibodies on exposure to IVIg-containing IgA, which causes adverse effects. Products 
depleted of IgA are preferable for such patients. 
Occasionally, patients continue to have reactions despite addressing these issues. 
Changing to another product may be helpful. Occasionally, continued prophylaxis 
with paracetamol, antihistamine or even steroid is required. Other acute reactions are 
usually associated with infusion of higher doses of IVIg (hdIVIg) for immunomodulation 
(Section 4.9). 
No blood product is completely safe and transmission of blood-borne infection is a 
concern. Additional virucidal steps in IVIg production minimise this risk, however vigilance 
is always required. HIV infection has never been transmitted by IVIg. Hepatitis C virus has 
been transmitted by IVIg with serious consequences. Prion transmission risk (new variant 
Creutzfeld Jacob disease agent) is unknown but is possible in theory. 
Attempts to limit the risk of blood-borne prion disease have seriously compromised the 
availability of plasma worldwide. Shortfalls in relation to demands are now regularly 
experienced posing life-threatening risks for antibody-deficient patients should supply fail. 
PATIENT MONITORING 
Patients receiving Ig replacement therapy should be monitored in relation to the following: 
Efficacy 
386 
¢ 
Clinical status (e.g. daily diary detailing well-being, infection, antibiotic usage). 
¢ 
Assessment of progress of underlying diseases — for example, pulmonary function 
and high resolution CT of thorax. 
¢ 
Trough levels of IgG (just before infusion) should be measured regularly and 
dose/interval adjusted accordingly. Trough IgG should be within the normal range and 
Safety 
Ig REPLACEMENT THERAPY 
probably higher in patients with established lung disease and in CVID patients with 
granulomata. Clinical status rather than IgG levels are the mainstay of monitoring of 
patients with multiple myeloma and CLL. 
All infusions, product and batch numbers should be logged. 
Interchange of product and batch number exposure should be minimised in individual 
patients. 
Serial pre-infusion liver function testing and storage of samples for viral studies will 
allow prompt identification of infection should it occur. 
Careful records facilitate identification of the culprit product.

High Dose Immunoglobulin 
Therapy 
In several immune-mediated disorders high dose IVIg (hdIVIg) is increasingly used as an 
immunomodulatory therapy. The benefits of hdIVIg have been demonstrated in some 
conditions 
(e.g. immune thrombocytopaenia 
(ITP), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), 
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)). High-dose IVIg is also used 
empirically in some situations without clear-cut evidence of effectiveness. This treatment is 
associated with several risks, is expensive and there is a permanent shortfall of IVIg supply. 
_ MECHANISMS OF ACTION 
There are a number of potential mechanisms by which hdIVIg may alter immune 
activation, including: 
Fc receptor blockade 
Occupation of phagocytic cell Fe receptors by infused Ig inhibits binding and destruction of 
antibody-bound cells. 
Deactivation of pathogenic targets 
Antibodies against pathogenic antibodies 
(anti-antibodies/anti-idiotypes) found in 
polyclonal IVIg may limit damaging effects of autoantibodies. Antimicrobial antibodies may 
similarly impair the action of pathogenic microbes. 
Inhibitory effects on B cells 
Polyclonal IVIg concentrate has been shown to reduce output of pathogenic antibodies by B cells. 
Altered cytokine networks 
Direct reduction in cytokine production, together with immune modulating effects of 
cytokines and cytokine receptors present in IVIg preparations may affect T cell proliferation, 
B cell activity and patterns of immune responses. 
388 
HIGH-DOSE Ig THERAPY 
One mode of action may predominate as is the case in ITP where Fe receptor blockade 
with hdIVIg results in reduced phagocyte destruction of the platelet targets. This is a short- 
lived effect (S-7 days) but increases the platelet count when critically low or in advance of 
surgical procedures. In many instances, the precise actions of IVIg are not well-understood. 
CLINICAL INDICATIONS 
Indications for which at least one IVIg preparation is licensed and conditions where trials 
have shown effectiveness of hdIVIg (asterisked) include: 
¢ 
Haematological conditions — ITP*, haemolytic anaemia, alloimmune-thrombocytopaenia 
* 
Neurological 
diseases 
—- 
Guillain-Barré syndrome*, CIDP*, myasthenia 
gravis, 
Eaton—Lambert syndrome 
* 
Vasculitis 
- Kawasaki disease*, ANCA-related vasculitides 
* 
Connective tissue diseases — SLE, polymyositis, dermatomyositis 
¢ 
Dermatological - pemphigus, pemphigoid. 
High-dose IVIg is of doubtful or no benefit in SLE, MS, intractable inflammatory bowel 
disease and RA, and it may be potentially harmful in some of these cases. 
ADMINISTRATION 
General points regarding the administration of IVIg are outlined in Section 4.8. The typical 
dosage for immunomodulatory indications is 2 g/kg, usually administered in five divided 
doses over five consecutive days, although larger doses and/or shorter periods may be used. 
Patients receiving hdIVIg are at risk of all the side effects outlined in Section 4.8. 
Additionally, the following side effects are particularly associated with hdIVlg. 
* 
Aseptic meningitis — headache and meningism with lymphocytic CSF inflammation. 
@ 
Renal impairment — especially in the elderly or in patients with pre-existing renal 
impairment. Sucrose containing products may pose increased risk. 
@ 
Hyperviscosity — increases risk of MI and CVA in predisposed patients. 
¢ 
Immune complex-mediated reactions 
— serum sickness — in patients with immune 
complex disorders, for example, SLE and with high-titre rheumatoid factor (RF). 
¢ 
Intravascular haemolysis. 
* 
Severe anaphylactoid reactions. 
The risk of these side effects can be lessened by avoiding hdIVIg in high-risk patients. All 
potential patients should be screened for renal impairment, RF activity and IgA deficiency. 
High-risk patients should only be treated if the indication is strong and alternative thera- 
pies are contraindicated. High-dose IVIg therapy should be administered slowly in these 
groups until tolerability has been assessed. Renal function should be monitored daily and 
therapy abandoned if a significant (>20%) rise in creatinine is seen. FBC and other indi- 
cators of immune activation in immune complex disease (e.g. serial complement levels) may 
also be useful during hdIVIg.

Cytokines 
Cytokines are soluble messengers, which coordinate the immune response. Physiologically, 
cytokines usually act in a paracrine fashion (exerting their action on nearby cells). Cytokines 
have many potent effects on the immune system, necessitating tight control of cytokine 
production during an immune response. At present, therapeutic use of cytokines 
cannot replicate this localisation or control of activity. Cytokines are small biologically 
active proteins; they cannot be administered orally due to local effects on the gut and 
digestion. 
Despite limitations imposed by current delivery systems, cytokines are being used to 
treat a number of conditions: 
* 
Replacement therapy in cytokine deficiency 
¢ 
To augment or redirect the immune response

As immunomodulatory therapy. 
Because of their generally short half-life, these agents often require frequent administration 
and/or modification of the molecule to increase the half-life. 
REPLACEMENT THERAPY 
390 
IL-2 deficiency is a rare cause of SCID. Regular administration of IL-2 has been associated 
with clinical improvement and normalisation of T cell proliferation. 
Genetically transmitted IL-12 and IL-12 receptor deficiencies and defects in the IFN-y 
receptor are associated with increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections and 
salmonellosis. Regular treatment with subcutaneous IFN-y can be used as an adjuvant to 
treatment of infection as well as prophylaxis against further infections. In patients with 
partial deficiency of the IFN-y receptor high doses of IFN-y may be effective, although not 
surprisingly such treatment is usually unsuccessful in complete deficiency of the IFN-y 
receptor. 
CYTOKINES 
AUGMENTING THE IMMUNE RESPONSE 
Cytokines are used in the treatment of cancers and some infections, where at least part of 
their therapeutic effect results from augmentation of the immune response. IL-2 is thought 
to have an anti-cancer effect due to immune stimulation. IFN-a has anti-tumour effects, 
which may be direct or related to the immunological effects of this cytokine. Interferons 
have also been used in a number of chronic infections. Beneficial effects are likely to be due 
to both immune stimulation as well as direct anti-viral effects. 
Recombinant IL-2 is licensed for subcutaneous use in patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma. It is highly toxic, and although tumour shrinkage has been documented, 
survival does not appear to be increased. Toxicity is universal and often severe with 
capillary leak syndrome, which causes pulmonary oedema-and hypotension, as well as bone 
marrow, hepatic, renal and CNS toxicity. 
IFN-a 
is used for treatment of haematological malignancies and solid tumours. 
Additionally, IFN-a is used as an adjuvant therapy for malignant melanoma as well 
as maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma in remission. Common side effects are 
dose-related and include nausea, 
influenza-like symptoms, 
lethargy and depression. 
Myelosuppression, cardiovascular problems, nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity may also 
occur. 
IFN-a 
is also licensed for treatment of chronic Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. In 
combination with ribavirin, IFN-a leads to clearance of virus in a significant proportion of 
patients with Hepatitis C. A beneficial effect of IFN-a has also been shown in lepromatous 
leprosy (where a predominantly T helper cell, type 2 (TH2) type response fails to control 
the infection), and in visceral leischmaniasis. 
IMMUNOMODULATION 
The original rationale for treating MS with IFN-f8 was based on the hypothesis that MS 
was due to a defective immune response to an unidentified viral pathogen. IFN-B was 
found to be beneficial in several types of MS. While the precise mechanism leading to 
clinical benefit in MS is poorly understood, the therapeutic effect of IFN-B is thought 
to be due to immunomodulatory effects. IFN-B rapidly restores the blood brain barrier 
in addition to inhibiting T cell proliferation, antigen presentation and T cell migration. 
Additionally, it appears to modify cytokine production towards an anti-inflammatory 
profile, both in the periphery and in the CNS. 
IFN-8 is self-administered by subcutaneous injection three times a week. The most 
common side effects are injection site reactions, influenza-like symptoms and depression. 
The possibility of modulating or redirecting the immune response in a number of other 
immunological disorders using cytokines is currently under investigation, and the list of 
therapeutic applications of such therapies is likely to grow substantially over the next 
decade.

Vaccination and Passive 
Immunisation 
Vaccination is the greatest success of immunology. In 1798 Jenner introduced a cowpox 
vaccine that protected against the antigenically related, lethal smallpox. Development of 
safe vaccines and mass vaccination led to the worldwide elimination of smallpox in the 
1980s. The WHO aims to eliminate polio in the near future. 
DEFINITIONS AND IMMUNOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES 
Passive immunisation 
This describes the administration of preformed antibody (‘antiserum’) derived from human 
or animal donors to the recipient. The effect is immediate but short-lived as the transferred 
immunoglobulin is metabolised. Immunological memory does not develop. 
Vaccination (active immunisation) 
During active immunisation, attenuated organisms, killed organisms or pathogen subunits 
are administered to the individual. The immune response develops slowly but immunolog- 
ical memory is evoked. Re-exposure of the subject to the pathogenic arganism produces a 
rapid, effective secondary response, which usually prevents symptomatic infection. 
Effective vaccines elicit protective immune responses both in type (antibody versus cellular 
immunity) and in site (mucosal or systemic). 
Passive immunisation — clinical uses 
Passive immunisation is used in the following circumstances: 
¢ 
To treat a number of serious infections.

To neutralise toxins (e.g. post-snakebite) and digitalis overdose (e.g. neutralising 
antibody inactivates the drug). Because the effects of passive immunisation 
are 
short-lived, vaccination is also given when available to ensure future protection. 
Active immunisation (vaccination) 
Vaccination produces an immune response capable of providing effective protective 
immunity in the absence of symptomatic infection. In any population some individuals will 
have contraindications to particular vaccines or will fail to respond. However, if 95% of 
the population are vaccinated, these non-vaccinated subjects are unlikely to come in 
contact with an infected subject. This protective effect is termed herd immunity. 
Vaccines in routine use include live attenuated vaccines, vaccines containing killed 
organisms and subunit vaccines. 
5 
Live attenuated organisms usually provide strong immunisation of the appropriate type 
and site for natural infection. In addition to developing immunity in the vaccinated 
subject, the attenuated organism can be passed to non-immunised subjects, eliciting 
protective responses and enhancing herd immunity. Live attenuated vaccines carry a 
risk of reversion to pathogenic strains causing disease and pose a particular risk in 
immunocompromised subjects. 
Killed vaccines do not pose a risk of infection, but generally elicit weaker responses 
than live attenuated vaccines. Booster doses are usually required. 
Subunit vaccines contain proteins, carbohydrates or inactivated toxins from organisms. 
They are generally less immunogenic than intact organisms, and may require adjuvants 
to elicit effective immune responses. Schedules usually involve multiple doses. Side 
effects are generally less prominent than with whole organisms. As subunit vaccines 
contain no viable organisms, there is no risk of vaccine-associated infections, even in 
immunocompromised subjects. 
VACCINATION — CLINICAL USES 
Some vaccines are offered to everyone, while others are reserved for people at particular 
risk because of an underlying medical condition, occupational risk or travel. Schedules of 
routine vaccination vary in different parts of the world but current UK recommendations 
are used as an example in this section.

MODERN APPROACHES TO VACCINE DEVELOPMENTS 
Development of more effective and safer vaccines, as well as vaccines for other diseases is 
a major area of research. Molecular techniques have facilitated the production of large 
quantities of proteins for use as subunit vaccines safely and relatively cheaply. However, 
development of safe effective adjuvants to enhance the effectiveness of subunit vaccines 
remains a challenge. Additionally, as many infections gain entry to the body via the 
mucosa, delivery systems that enhance mucosal immunity would offer considerable 
394 
VACCINATION AND PASSIVE IMMUNISATION 
advantages. Direct injection of DNA into muscle elicits strong antibody and cellular 
immune responses in animal models, and is currently entering clinical trials. 
Vaccination has been particularly successful in diseases where natural infection leads to 
sterilising immunity and long-term immunity. Many other diseases remain major public 
health problems. The pathogens responsible often employ several of the evasion mechanisms 
described in Section 1.25. While vaccination has produced several advances in public 
health, many challenges remain.

Plasmapheresis and Plasma 
Exchange 
Plasmapheresis (PP) and plasma exchange (PE) are physical methods for removing plasma 
and replacing it with donor plasma (PE) or other fluids (PP). The patient is anticoagulated, 
connected to an extra-corporeal circuit and plasma is removed using a membrane filter or 
blood cells fractionated using a cell separator. The cellular elements are then reinfused 
together with the chosen replacement fluid. Between 0.5 and 1.5 plasma volumes can be 
exchanged at each session, depending on how well the patient tolerates the procedure. 
IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS 
PP and PE remove antibodies, intravascular immune complexes and other inflammatory 
mediators. PP can deplete complement and coagulation factors if this is required. The effects 
on antibody levels vary with the distribution of the isotype. A single plasma volume 
exchange will remove most IgM but only approximately 60% of IgG..The effect is short- 
lived as B cells become highly active in an immunoglobulin-poor environment and antibody 
levels may show a rebound phenomenon (antibodies rapidly climb higher than pretherapy 
levels) when treatment is stopped. To prevent this, immunosuppression using a powerful 
anti-B cell agent is usually commenced at the same time as PP. 
CLINICAL INDICATIONS 
396 
PP and/or PE may be used in the following conditions: 
Antibody-mediated rejection of transplanted organs 
Anti-GBM disease 
Severe ANCA-associated vasculitis

SIDESEREECTS 
Side effects include: 
@ 
Leakage or clotting in the extra-corporeal circuit. There is a high risk of circuit occlusion 
in patients with cryoglobulins that precipitate at room temperature. Prior to treatment 
a temperature profile is performed on the cryoglobulins to establish the temperature at 
which precipitation can be expected, allowing equipment, fluids and the room to be 
pre-heated to minimise this risk. 
¢ 
Bleeding due to anticoagulation and removal of coagulation factors. The risk is less 
with PE than PP. 
¢ 
Haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. 
397 
TREATMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS 
¢ 
Infection (due to removal of immunoglobulin). The risk can be reduced by including 
some intravenous immunoglobulin in the replacement fluid, particularly at the end of 
treatment. 
* 
Haemodynamic instability. 
Limitations in the use of these therapies include: 
¢ 
Access to equipment and appropriately trained personnel. 
¢ 
Patients need to be fit for the procedure. Contraindications include active bleeding, 
haemodynamic instability, anaemia or thrombocytopaenia or infection. 
* 
Two sites of intravenous access capable of generating sufficient flow rates are also 
required. 
OPTIMISING THERAPY 
398 
Most studies report results of standard courses of therapy (5 or 10 sessions). However, in 
many diseases the antibodies to be removed are readily measured, and the number of 
sessions required to remove antibody varies greatly between patients. It appears likely that 
close monitoring of patients during and immediately after PP to ensure that they become 
and remain antibody negative may improve the outcome of these therapies.

Management of Acute Allergic 
Reactions 
Clinical manifestations of allergies are described in Part 2. Acute allergic reactions cause 
symptoms varying from mild skin rash to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Accurate identification 
of the responsible 
allergen(s) 
often allows successful 
allergen avoidance. However, 
identification of unusual allergens may be impossible, particularly when reactions are infre- 
quent and details about reactions are vague. This part describes the emergency management 
of an acute allergic reaction, as well as the long-term management of affected patients. 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OF AN ACUTE ALLERGIC REACTION 
Emergency management of an acute allergic reaction is summarised in Figure 4.13.1. 
The drugs used for resuscitation are primarily adrenaline, fast-acting antihistamines and 
corticosteroids. 
Adrenaline is a physiological antagonist of many of histamine effects. Adrenaline 
reverses bronchospasm, reduces angioedema and increases blood pressure by reversing 
vasodilation and increasing cardiac output. Adrenaline is given intramuscularly in doses of 
0.5-1 mg (0.01 mg/kg). This dose can be repeated every 15 minutes until a response is 
obtained. In patients taking non-cardioselective B-blockers, addition of IV salbutamol 
should be considered. 
A fast-acting antihistamine such as chlorpheniramine given by slow IV injection minimises 
further effects of histamine. In serious reactions adrenaline should be given IM immediately, 
and then IV access can be secured to give other agents. 
Corticosteroids, usually IV hydrocortisone, take several hours to act. Steroids prevent 
or reduce secondary late phase reactions. Administration of rapidly acting medications 
obviously takes priority. 
Where there is any respiratory difficulty oxygen should be administered. Intravenous 
fluids and nebulised 8 -agonists are frequently required. 
Patients who have a reaction requiring the use of adrenaline should be monitored for 
8-24 hours in hospital as late phase reactions may cause deterioration. When discharged, 
patients should be given advice about further reactions and a prescription for a non-sedating,

_ 
NON-ACUTE ASPECTS OF MANAGEMENT 
400 
When patients have experienced an acute allergic reaction, further management aims to 
prevent recurrence and minimise the risks of future reactions. 
¢¢¢ 
¢ 
Essential aspects of management of include: 
Identification of the allergen(s) responsible. 
Patient education about allergen avoidance. 
Treatment of associated asthma if present. 
Avoidance of drugs which exacerbate reactions or hinder resuscitation (especially 
B-blockers). 
Formulation of an individualised emergency plan, with appropriate patient education 
to ensure that patients can manage future reactions appropriately. 
Ensure allergies to medication are documented in a manner accessible to all healthcare 
providers, to prevent future avoidable reactions (e.g. MedicAlert bracelet, case note 
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ALLERGIC REACTIONS 
Investigations to identify the allergen(s) responsible are described in Section 3.14. It is 
helpful to take a detailed history of foods and medications recently ingested as soon as pos- 
sible. Full investigation may take some time, and patients should have an emergency plan 
while investigations are proceeding, as the risk of further reactions is highest before the 
allergen(s) are identified. 
Underlying asthma is frequently exacerbated during an allergic reaction. Regular use of 
short-acting 85 agonists is associated with reduced 8, receptor expression in the lung, limiting 
the effectiveness of adrenaline and salbutamol in reversing bronchospasm, should resuscita- 
tion be required. Adequate use of inhaled steroids and other preventive medication to avoid 
overuse of short-acting 8» agonists is essential. 
Concomitant medications may exacerbate reactions or make resuscitation difficult. 
B-blockers inhibit many of the key actions of adrenaline (reversing bronchospasm and 
increasing cardiac output). Use of adrenaline in patients taking ®-blockers and tricyclic 
antidepressants may be associated with severe hypertension. Angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can cause angioedema, and may exacerbate allergic reactions. The 
risk—benefit ratio of any of the above medications should be carefully reviewed in patients 
who have had severe allergic reactions or where inadvertent allergen exposure is a 
significant risk, for example, in nut allergy. Patients should also be warned that alcohol and 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the severity of reactions. 
Even the most conscientious patient is likely to ingest foods inadvertently, and therefore 
it is essential that patients understand their own emergency plan. Mild reactions may be 
treated with a fast-acting, non-sedating antihistamine. Patients with asthma should also use 
high-dose, short-acting B> agonist immediately. More severe reactions including laryngeal 
oedema, bronchospasm or symptoms of hypotension require rapid medical attention. 
Self-administration of adrenaline while waiting for an ambulance may be life-saving. 
Adrenaline in a dose suitable for self-administration (300 wg) is available in pre-filled, 
ready-to-use syringes. 
All allergies to medications should be documented and the information transmitted to 
other healthcare providers. Patients with allergy to a medication commonly used in 
an emergency, or to latex should wear a MedicAlert bracelet. 
Desensitisation is a procedure that aims to prevent allergic reactions by exposure to 
minute doses of allergen, which are gradually increased. Not surprisingly, this form of 
therapy carries a significant risk of anaphylaxis. It is contraindicated in patients with severe 
asthma, significant ischaemic heart disease or those who cannot discontinue B-blocker 
therapy. Desensitisation is used for patients who have had systemic reactions to wasp and 
bee venom, and occasionally for drug allergies. Desensitisation may also be used in patients 
with allergies to inhaled antigens, unless there is associated asthma. Unfortunately there is 
no safe and effective form of desensitisation available for food allergies.

il 
Take blood for measurement of IgG level again. Increase the dose of the infusion to 30 g/l. The 
aim of the treatment is to restore IgG levels to normal. The dose of IVIg is relatively low, and 
clearly not adequate for this patient. 
If you are unfamiliar with the use of any immunosuppressive drug, you should seek advice from 
the person who prescribed the medication. Although the neutrophil count is normal (just) the 
progressive fall is a cause for concern and suggests thatvthe azathioprine is causing marrow 
suppression. Azathioprine should be stopped or reduced to alow dose and the FBC checked in 
a few days. This patient will need careful monitoring and is unlikely to tolerate doses above 
100 mg of azathioprine. 
Possible causes of microscopic haematuria include haemorrhagic cystitis due to cyclophosphamide, 
new vasculitic renal involvement or possibly a urinary tract infection. Urine microscopy is essential. 
Red cell casts indicate glomerular damage (due to disease) however, absence of glomerular casts 
does not exclude renal involvement. Urine should also be cultured, and creatinine, acute phase 
markers (CRP and ESR) as well as ANCA levels should be checked urgently. If haemorrhagic 
cystitis appears most likely, cyclophosphamide should be stopped. If disease is in remission it may 
be possible to switch to azathioprine. If cyclophosphamide is essential to control disease, hyper- 
hydration and mesna for bladder protection will be needed. 
Carcinoma of the cervix can progress rapidly in immunosuppressed women, and therefore a 
positive smear requires urgent action. A high vaginal swab to rule out infection should be 
taken. If infection is present it should be treated and an urgent repeat smear sent. If there is no 
infection or the repeat smear is abnormal the patient should be referred for colposcopy. 
A bone density scan is helpful. Lifestyle factors contributing to osteoporosis (diet, exercise, 
alcohol intake and smoking) should be discussed. Supplementary calcium and vitamin D3 have 
some effect, however bisphosphonate therapy is more effective and is definitely indicated if 
there are signs of osteoporosis on bone density scan. Hormone replacement therapy slows post- 
menopausal bone loss, and is advised in most women requiring long-term steroids unless there 
are significant risk factors for breast cancer or thrombosis. 
Do not give infliximab! Infliximab therapy is associated with the development of TB and other 
opportunistic infections. This gentleman requires an urgent work up to assess the cause of his 
symptoms, and should be isolated until it is established whether he has TB. 
PP removes both protective and pathogenic antibodies. Many patients drop their IgG level to 
undetectable levels, and are unable to localise infection resulting in septicaemia. This man 
should not have further PP or cyclophosphamide until sepsis is controlled. A one off dose of 
intravenous Ig is often a very useful adjuvant when sepsis develops during PP.

Clinical Immunology — Future 
Prospects 
Clinical immunology is a rapidly evolving specialty, which has changed dramatically over 
the last decade. Our rapidly advancing understanding of the immune system, together with 
the developments in molecular genetics, pharmacology and transplantation will continue to 
improve the care we can offer to patients with immunological disorders in the coming 
decade. This section briefly outlines some recent developments that we feel are likely to 
change the way we look after patients. 
_ MOLECULAR GENETICS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE 
The draft sequence of the human genome was published in 2001. A huge amount of work 
remains to complete our understanding of our genetic makeup, however this represents a 
major milestone. Available technologies allow us to research genetic changes occurring 
under a variety of circumstances and to determine the impact of conditions on genetic 
sequences even before individual genes are identified. 
The genetic changes involved in many inherited and acquired diseases have been estab- 
lished. This knowledge will allow rational design of therapies to inhibit disease-causing 
molecules. A striking example is the design of STIS71 in the treatment of chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (CML). CML is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, a balanced recip- 
rocal translocation that activates the ABL oncogene. The translocation produces expression 
of the ABL oncogene, a chronically active tyrosine kinase that produces uncontrolled 
myeloid cell proliferation. STIS71 is a specific inhibitor of this protein, which can switch 
off the leukaemic process. 
GENE THERAPY 
404 
Understanding the precise genetic basis of disease provides an opportunity to replace 
defective genes using gene therapy. This poses many challenges including delivery of 
genes to the appropriate cells, persistence and control of gene expression and avoiding 
interference with the function of other genes. 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
— FUTURE PROSPECTS 
One of the first diseases to be successfully treated by gene therapy is X-linked SCID, due 
to defects in the common cytokine receptor y-chain. The normal gene can be introduced 
into the patients own lymphoid progenitor cells, which are then infused into the patient to 
reconstitute the immune system. Several patients have established protective immunity 
following gene therapy. Unfortunately, 
a small number of patients have developed 
leukaemia, when integration of the therapeutic gene has disrupted unrelated normal genes. 
VACCINATION 
Vaccination harnesses immunological memory to protect against infection. Vaccination has 
been extremely successful in conditions where natural infections leads to lifelong protective 
immunity, including smallpox, poliomyelitis and measles. However, in conditions where 
infection does not produce sterilising, protective immunity, vaccine design has proved 
more challenging. Major vaccine challenges include HIV and malaria. Vaccination is 
immunology’s greatest contribution to public health to date. Success in designing vaccines 
against HIV and malaria would change life for whole populations. 
TARGETED IMMUNOMODULATION 
Our understanding of the molecular basis of immunity has led to attempts to modulate the 
immune response in a highly specific way to treat autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, as 
well as improving outcomes in clinical transplantation. The majority of applications currently 
undergoing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assessment are of biological therapeutic 
agents; many designed to alter the immune response. Repeated use of therapeutic antibodies 
has been made possible by humanising these molecules using protein-engineering techniques. 
Granuloma formation is known to be critically dependent on the cytokine TNF-a. 
Crohn’s disease, a granulomatous inflammatory bowel disease is highly responsive to 
biological agents which block the action of TNF-a. Additionally, the incidence of rejection 
following renal transplantation can be reduced by using antibodies which deplete activated 
T cells, by binding to CD25, a component of the IL-2 receptor. 
PHARMACOGENOMICS 
Racial and individual variation in the enzymes that metabolise drugs influences how well 
drugs work as well as the risk of drug toxicity. Knowledge of functional polymorphisms in 
genes encoding enzymes that metabolise drugs allows us to predict both toxicity and drug 
efficacy. For example, isoniazid an anti-ITB agent is metabolised by acetylation. When 
treated with a standard dose, individuals who acetylate drugs slowly are at high risk of 
toxicity, while fast acetylators rarely experience toxicity, but have a poor therapeutic effect. 
In the future, knowledge of a patient’s acetylation status may allow us individualise the dose 
of drug, to obtain the best balance between efficacy and toxicity. Similar assessments are 
beginning to be used to optimise treatment with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug. 
XENOTRANSPLANTATION 
The major limiting factor in clinical transplantation is the availability of donor organs of 
suitable quality. Use of organs from animals could provide an adequate supply of organs, 
405 
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY 
— FUTURE PROSPECTS 
406 
available on a planned basis. The initial barrier to xenotransplantation was hyperacute 
rejection, mediated by complement, because of the species specificity of complement 
control proteins. Transgenic pigs have been produced which express human complement 
control proteins to prevent this problem. There is still a lot to learn about subsequent types 
of rejection xenotransplantation. However, at present the major concern delaying clinical 
trials is concern about transmission of infection from donor animal organs to immuno- 
suppressed humans. This may never happen, however the fear of an infection jumping the 
species barrier as HIV did in the last century is proving much more challenging than the 
immunological aspects of xenotransplantation. 
The practice of medicine and clinical immunology 
will change considerably and 
unpredictably over the next decade. However, understanding the basics of the immune 
system in health and disease will remain essential for healthcare professionals looking after 
patients with immunological disorders. 
Glossary 
Adrenal insufficiency 
Impaired hormone production by the adrenal gland. This may be 
due to infection, autoimmune destruction, haemorrhage into the gland or rarely, 
tumours. Autoimmune destruction may occur in isolation, or in association with 
autoimmune destruction of other endocrine glands, in autoimmune polyglandular 
syndrome. Symptoms include fatigue, abnormal pigmentation and hypotension, which 
may be severe. 
Alopaecia 
Abnormal hair loss. Generalised alopaecia may be associated with both non- 
immunological and immunological (especially autoimmune thyroid disease and SLE) 
causes. Patchy hair loss is seen in alopaecia areata. 
Alveolitis 
Inflammation centred on the alveoli or airspaces in the lung. The term is 
usually only used when inflammation is not caused by infection. Patients present with 
cough and breathlessness. There may be an infiltrate on chest X-ray, however, high 
resolution CT picks up disease at an earlier stage. Pulmonary function tests show 
impaired gas transfer. Immune causes of alveolitis include extrinsic allergic alveolitis, 
the connective tissue diseases and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. When chronic, 
alveolitis may progress to pulmonary fibrosis. 
Anaemia 
Reduction in the haemoglobin content of the blood. This may be due to 
impaired production or increased loss or destruction of red blood cells. Size of the red 
blood cells may be increased (macrocytic), normal (normocytic) or reduced (micro- 
cytic) and the haemoglobin content may be normal (normocytic) 
or reduced 
(hypochromic). Patients present with fatigue and when severe, the reduced oxygen 
carrying capacity of the blood may cause breathlessness and angina. 
Anaemia, megaloblastic 
Specific type of anaemia due to deficiency of folate or vitamin 
By. This results in impaired maturation of red blood cells and production of reduced 
numbers of large (macrocytic) red blood cells. 
Angioedema 
Swelling of tissues due to increased permeability of local blood vessels. In 
the skin this causes visible swelling, in the gastrointestinal tract, crampy abdominal 
pain, and in the upper airways, airways obstruction. Causes include allergy, C1 
inhibitor deficiency as well as drugs which cause histamine release and some 
anti-hypertensives. 
407 
GLOSSARY 
408 
Arthralgia 
Joint pains in the absence of any evidence of inflammation. 
Arthritis, inflammatory 
Inflammation of joints. Patients present with pain and stiffness, 
typically worst in the morning. Joints may be swollen due to either synovial thicken- 
ing or accumulation of synovial fluid, and occasionally red and hot. Causes include 
rheumatoid disease, connective tissue disease and seronegative spondylarthropathies. 
Arthritis, reactive 
Immune-mediated, sterile, inflammatory arthritis, triggered by infec- 
tion, most commonly of the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tracts. Infection may be 
subclinical, and the arthritis may occur several weeks after the inciting infection. Sore 
eyes often co-exist. Reiter’s syndrome refers to the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis (red, 
sore eyes) and urethritis (inflammation of the urethra). 
Ataxia 
Inability to coordinate movements. Axial ataxia primarily involves the limbs, while 
truncal ataxia affects the trunk — both types cause unsteadiness when walking. Ataxia 
is associated with cerebellar disease, and also severe loss of sensation, particularly 
proprioception. 
Atherosclerosis 
Presence of atheroma within arteries, commonly known as ‘hardening of 
the arteries’. Atheroma forms plaques consisting of fatty deposits in the vessel wall, 
induces an inflammatory reaction, as well as proliferation of smooth muscle in the 
medial layer of the arterial wall. Thrombus can form on the plaque surface, blocking 
the artery and damaging tissue or organs supplied by the vessel. Plaques can also rup- 
ture, with contents forming emboli which travel to distal vessels causing ischaemia of 
tissue supplied by these vessels. 
Bacterial sepsis 
Infection caused by bacteria, which may be localised (e.g. in the airways) 
or generalised (septicaemia, where bacteria enter the blood stream and continue to 
proliferate). 
Bronchiectasis 
Irreversible bronchial dilatation and inflammation, usually the result of 
chronic or repeated airway injury from repeated episodes of infection. Patients experi- 
ence repeated frequent chest infection and often produce sputum on a daily basis, even 
between exacerbations. Once bronchiectasis is established infections will usually con- 
tinue even if the underlying cause is identified and treated. Causes include immuno- 
deficiency, abnormalities of the mucociliary elevator such as immotile cilia syndrome, 
cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. 
Congestive heart failure 
Results from inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood to 
meet metabolic demands. This results in increased venous pressure, with oedema 
formation. When the right side of the heart fails, oedema is in peripheral tissue, while 
left heart failure results in pulmonary oedema. Either side or both sides may fail. 
Congestive heart failure may occur in the late stages of any type of heart disease. 
Encephalomyelitis 
Inflammation of brain and spinal cord. Patients present with varied 
neurological deficits, depending on the areas within the brain and cord which are 
involved. Imaging generally shows extensive white matter change, and cerebrospinal 
fluid will have raised protein and white cells. Causes include infection and autoimmune 
disease. 
: 
Endocrinopathy 
Abnormal function of one or more endocrine glands. 
Glomerulonephritis 
A group of renal disorders in which the pathological process 
primarily involves the glomerulus. In some, inflammation can be seen on biopsy. 
However, in some types of glomerulonephritis classical features of inflammation are 
not seen. Patients present with varying combinations of haematuria, proteinuria, 
impaired renal function, hypertension, nephritic or nephritic syndrome. 
Gluten-sensitive enteropathy 
Better-known as coeliac disease. An immune-mediated 
adverse reaction to gluten-containing foods results in small bowel inflammation with 
subsequent malabsorption. Clinical presentation is varied and can include low body 
weight and in children failure to thrive, anaemia, osteoporosis and in some patients it 
is clinically silent and is a coincidental finding. Clinical and histological abnormalities 
GLOSSARY 
improve with exclusion of gluten-containing foods. A small proportion of patients, 
especially if poorly compliant with diet, develop small bowel lymphoma. 
Haematuria 
Presence of blood in the urine, which may be macroscopic (visible to the 
naked eye) or microscopic (only detected on laboratory testing). Haematuria may be 
due to inflammation or tumours of the kidneys or urinary tract. The presence of red 
blood cell casts (small tubular structures identified on microscopy) indicates bleeding 
from the glomerulus rather than the lower urinary tract. 
Haemoptysis 
The coughing-up of blood. This 
is an important clinical symptom. 
Underlying causes include lung malignancy, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism, pneu- 
monia, lung abscess, anti-GBM disease and vasculitic conditions such as Wegener’s 
granulomatosus and other ANCA-positive conditions like micro-polyangiitis and 
Churg-Strauss syndrome. Haemoptysis always warrants further clinical evaluation. 
Hyperthyroidism 
Overactivity of the thyroid gland with uncontrolled and excessive 
production of thyroid hormone. The term thyrotoxicosis is also used to describe this 
clinical state. Autoimmune ( Graves’ disease), toxic nodular goitre and viral-induced 
inflammation are important underlying causes. Clinical features reflect the increase in 
metabolic activity induced by excess amounts of thyroid hormone and include weight 
loss, diarrhoea, heat intolerance, palpitations, mental nervousness and insomnia. 
Goitre (swelling of the thyroid gland) may be present but is not invariable. 
Hypothyroidism 
Underactivity of the thyroid gland with deficiency of thyroid hormone 
production. Autoimmune destruction is an important cause. Patients present with one 
or more of the following features: tiredness and excessive sleepiness, weight gain, 
coarsening of the facial features, hoarseness, constipation, loss of concentration and 
elevated cholesterol. Replacement with adequate levels of thyroid hormone brings 
about clinical improvement. 
Impetigo 
Skin infection caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus resulting in a 
golden crusted pus-containing eruption, usually around the mouth or nose. Most cases 
respond to anti-staphylococcal antibiotics applied directly to the affected skin or by 
mouth. 
Interstitial lung disease 
An inflammatory disorder of the gas exchanging units of the 
lung — the alveoli — resulting from immune-mediated or toxic damage. Patients present 
with progressive breathlessness and in some cases progress to lung failure. Interstitial 
lung disease can be the sole pathology or represent one manifestation of a multi-system 
disease. Causes include sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis conditions such as 
farmer’s lung, bird fancier’s lung etc., connective tissue diseases and rheumatoid arthritis 
and pneumoconiosis such as occurs in coal miners. 
Ischaemia 
Injury to tissue or organ caused by impaired blood supply. When severe 
and/or sustained results in necrosis. Symptoms and signs depend on the organ or tissue 
involved. 
Lipodystrophy 
An abnormal distribution of fat tissue. Loss of fat tissue from the upper 
body with excess deposition in the lower body — partial lipodystrophy — is a charac- 
teristic feature in patients presenting with a particular kidney inflammatory disorder 
(mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis Type II - 
dense deposit disease) causing 
nephrotic syndrome. 
Livedo reticularis 
A blue, mottled net-like (reticulate) discoloration of the skin seen 
particularly on the lower limbs. This is seen in some autoimmune conditions, most 
notably the anti-phospholipid syndrome, where proneness to clot formation is the 
predominant presenting feature, but is also seen in vasculitic disorders such as 
polyarteritis nodosa. 
Liver disease, chronic 
Liver damage resulting from an ongoing injury, usually toxic 
(particularly alcohol), viral, metabolic or autoimmune. Unless the cause is removed 
or treated, cirrhosis and portal hypertension may result. Symptoms include fatigue, 
409 
GLOSSARY 
410 
jaundice, abdominal discomfort and examination findings include jaundice, spider 
naevi, ascites, hepatic enlargement and splenomegaly due to portal hypertension. 
Lymphadenopathy 
Enlargement of lymph glands, which may be localised or generalised. 
Short-lived enlargement of regional lymph glands is appropriate during acute infection. 
However, persistently enlarged glands may be a sign of chronic infection, autoimmune 
disease, sarcoidosis, lymphoproliferative disorder or non-lymphoid malignancy. Glands 
in the neck, axilla and groin are palpable on clinical examination, however, imaging 1s 
required to assess nodes in the thorax and abdomen. 
Lymphopaenia 
Reduction in the lymphocyte count below the age-related lower limit of 
normal. Lymphopaenia is commonly seen in acutely ill patients. However persistent 
lymphopaenia may be associated with immunodeficiency, SLE as well as being induced 
by drugs, for example, immunosuppressants and steroids. 
Mononeuritis multiplex 
Abnormal function affecting two or more peripheral nerves. 
Involvement of motor nerves results in weakness, while disease affecting sensory nerves 
causes paraesthesia (pins and needles) and numbness. Usually caused by pathology of 
the vasa nervorum, the artery supplying blood to the nerve. Causes include vasculitis 
and diabetes mellitus. 
Myocardial infarction 
Necrosis of heart muscle (myocardium) due to impaired blood 
supply. This is usually a complication of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries, but 
rarely occurs due to vasculitis. 
Nephritic syndrome 
Reduced urine output (oliguria), hypertension and haematuria. 
Usually caused by some types of acute glomerulonephritis, such as post-infectious 
glomerulonephritis. 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Gross proteinuria (>3 g/24 hours), reduced serum albumin level 
and oedema. Also usually accompanied by hypercholesterolaemia and an increased 
risk of thrombosis. Caused by glomerular disease including diabetic nephropathy and 
several types of glomerulonephritis. 
Neuropathy, autonomic 
Pathological process involving the nerves of the autonomic 
nervous system. These nerves are essential to maintain control of several essential 
bodily functions including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory reflexes and gastric 
emptying. Autonomic functions generally do not involve conscious effort. Autonomic 
neuropathy can cause life-threatening abnormalities of cardiovascular or respiratory 
function. 
Neuropathy, sensory 
Abnormality of nerve fibres transmitting impulses from sensory 
receptors tu the central nervous system. Patients present with paraesthesia (pins and 
needles) and numbness. This may start at the peripheries and move proximally (glove 
and stocking distribution) or may follow the distribution of affected nerves. Causes 
include toxins (including alcohol), diabetes mellitus, vitamin deficiency, autoimmune 
conditions and vasculitis. 
Neutropaenia 
Reduction in the neutrophil count, which may be due to impaired marrow 
production or increased destruction. When severe, neutropaenia may be associated 
with rapidly progressive life-threatening bacterial sepsis. 
Oliguria 
Reduction in urine output (<500 ml/day in an adult). This indicates acute or 
acute-on-chronic renal failure. 
Paraesthesia 
Abnormal sensation, commonly known as ‘pins and needles’. This is most 
commonly associated with injury to peripheral sensory nerves, but may also be seen 
with lesions in the central nervous system. The majority of patients will have a non- 
immunological cause 
for this symptom, however, immunological causes include 
chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy and multiple sclerosis. 
Paraneoplastic syndrome (including cerebellar degeneration) 
This term refers to a 
number of specific syndromes where tissue-specific dysfunction arises in combination 
with particular tumours at other sites. The affected tissue is not invaded by tumour but 
GLOSSARY 
rather is inflamed with resultant dysfunction or destruction. Similarities between 
tumour antigens and host antigens with subsequent immune mediated attack in host 
tissues underlie paraneoplastic disorders. Successful treatment of the tumour can result 
in resolution of the paraneoplastic symptoms. The nervous system is a common site 
where paraneoplastic syndromes occur. Specific syndromes include conditions such as 
the myasthenia gravis-like Lambert—-Eaton syndrome with muscle fatigue and weak- 
ness, and cerebellar dysfunction. 
Pericardial effusion A collection of fluid in the pericardial space surrounding the heart 
muscle. A variety of causes are recognised, including tumour invasion, infections such 
as tuberculosis but also connective tissue diseases like SLE and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Patients present with varying severity of symptoms ranging from mild breathlessness 
through to gross heart failure when the volume of fluid surrounding the heart tissue pre- 
vents efficient heart muscle contraction. Fluid aspiration can assist in diagnosis and is 
used to relieve symptoms that occur in more severe cases. 
Pleural effusion A collection of fluid in the space between the two layers of pleura sur- 
rounding the lung. Patients may be asymptomatic, but usually present with breathless- 
ness due to the reduction in lung volume with bigger effusions. Many causes are 
recognised. The level of protein in the pleural fluid is helpful in diagnosing the likely 
cause. Low levels of protein (transudative pleural effusions) occur in states where albu- 
min levels are reduced, for example, chronic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome etc., as 
well as in heart and kidney failure. Exudative effusions where protein content in the 
pleural fluid is high, are seen in infections including tuberculosis, with lung malignan- 
cies, in pulmonary embolism and in systemic inflammatory disorders such as rheuma- 
toid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 
Polymyositis 
A generalised inflammatory condition of muscles characterised by painful 
muscle weakness, especially notable in the upper parts of the arms and legs. Disorders 
of the breathing and swallowing muscles are also seen and can cause respiratory 
embarrassment and difficulty swallowing. Arthritis, inflammatory eye problems and 
very distinctive skin lesions with purplish discoloration around the eyelids and hands 
are also seen. Aggressive vasculitis is a feature in affected children. Some patients have 
co-existent malignancy and this should be considered, especially in patients presenting 
in later life or with suspicious clinical features. Muscle biopsy, electrical studies and 
autoimmune serology are useful in making the diagnosis. 
Polyneuropathy A generalised dysfunction of many nerves, most typically distal peri- 
pheral nerves, manifesting with sensory derangments such as numbness, ‘pins and 
needles’ or burning pain in a glove and stocking distribution. Weakness can also be a 
feature. Causes are manifold but include diabetes mellitus, kidney failure, vitamin B 
deficiencies, excessive alcohol intake, connective tissue diseases, paraprotein disorders, 
and some genetic conditions. 
Pre-eclampsia 
A disorder of pregnancy characterised by high blood pressure, excessive 
protein loss in the urine, swelling (oedema) and in severe cases seizures. Fetal growth 
in the womb can be impaired. The basic pathology lies in a dysfunctional placenta 
provoking the hypertensive and other changes outlined. This condition is a major cause 
of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and is important to recognise before 
it becomes severe. Bed rest, anti-hypertensive drugs and in severe cases, induced or 
caesarean delivery are indicated. 
Protein losing enteropathy 
Increased protein loss from abnormal gut mucosa resulting 
in low levels of albumin and oedema. Conditions such as coeliac disease, severe small 
bowel Crohn’s disease and many unusual disorders are causative. 
Pulmonary hypertension 
Elevation of the normally low blood pressure within the 
pulmonary artery occurring as a result of chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibro- 
sis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary emboli and bronchiectasis; 
411 
GLOSSARY 
412 
congenital heart diseases and valve diseases; and rarely as a primary phenomenon. 
Patients present with progressive tiredness, breathlessness and features of right-sided 
heart failure. Outlook is poor and heart-lung transplantation may be required in some 
cases. 
Pulmonary-renal syndrome 
Co-existent acute lung and kidney dysfunction occuring in 
the context of a systemic vasculitic disorder such as Goodpasture’s syndrome, micro- 
polyangiitis and Wegener’s granulomatosis. Patients present with acute kidney failure 
with microscopic haematuria, and varying levels of lung failure with associated 
haemoptysis and pulmonary haemorrhage evident on chest X-ray. Intensive supportive 
management and specific therapy aimed at reversing the vasculitic inflammation 1s 
required urgently. 
Raynaud's phenomenon __ Intermittent spasm in the small arteries of the hands, feet and 
other peripheries precipitated by cold and relieved by heat. Digits initially go very 
white due to the spasm, with a subsequent blue discoloration due to poor oxygenation 
followed by a red painful discoloration on heating up and vasodilatation of the blood 
vessels. In severe cases, digital ulcers and even necrosis requiring amputation may 
occur. Primary Raynaud’s features without underlying pathology are usually mild and 
this is referred to as Raynaud’s disease. However, some cases occur as part of a sys- 
temic connective tissue disease or with rheumatoid arthritis, as a result of physical 
injury or secondary to certain drugs such as beta-blockers. Investigation and specific 
management is important in such cases. 
Renal failure, acute 
Rapid deterioration in kidney function with resultant fluid, elec- 
trolyte and acid-base upset. This can arise either because of a primary disease of the 
kidney itself (for example, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, pyelonephritis, interstitial 
nephritis), or as a result of impaired blood supply to the kidney (such as occurs in shock 
states like dehydration, massive haemorrhage, or cardiac failure) or in conditions where 
urinary output is seriously obstructed with resultant kidney damage (for example, pro- 
static enlargement, ureteric damage or tumour invasion). Correction of the underlying 
disorder often allows kidney function to return to a baseline. Intensive management is 
required for optimal outcome. 
Renal failure, chronic 
Gradual decline in kidney function over the space of months or 
years. Outlook depends on the nature of the underlying condition and presence and 
nature of other medical problems. Some disorders can be slowed down in their rate of 
progress more than others with specific treatments. Management of high blood pres- 
sure is an timportant aspect of all patients’ care. Eventually most patients, if they live, 
will require kidney replacement therapy, for example, dialysis or kidney transplant. 
Rhinitis 
Inflammation of the nasal passages manifesting with symptoms such as nasal 
congestion, discharge, itching, post-nasal drip and sore throat. Many causes are recog- 
nised including allergic, infective, vasomotor and drug-related. Correct identification 
of the causative agent is important for successful management. 
Sarcoidosis 
A disorder characterised by the presence of granulomafous inflammation 
in various organs or tissues. Presentation is varied both in the tissues involved and in 
the duration and severity of the presentation. Lung involvement ranging from enlarged 
lymph nodes in the chest through to a progressive lung fibrosis is common. Liver, brain 
and renal involvement is also seen. The nature and severity of the clinical presentation 
dictate therapy. 
Sclerodactyly 
Tightening of the skin of the fingers and toes giving the appearance of 
shiny tapered digits. This is a characteristic feature of the limited systemic sclerosis 
syndrome also known as CREST syndrome. 
Splenomegaly 
Enlargement of the spleen, most commonly due to infection, autoimmune 
disease, lymphoproliferative disorders or liver disease. The spleen must be twice its 
normal size to be palpable on examination. Splenomegaly is usually asymptomatic 
GLOSSARY 
unless the spleen is massively enlarged. When significantly enlarged the spleen is more 
prone to rupture, which can result in life threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage. 
Telangiectasiae 
Abnormalities of the small blood vessels of the skin and mucosal surfaces 
manifesting as ‘broken veins’. These lesions are seen in some immunological conditions, 
for example, systemic sclerosis, but are also seen in other disorders such as hereditary 
haemorrhagic telengiectasiae, where mucosal lesions in the gastrointestinal tract and 
less commonly the brain can be associated with fatal haemorrhage. 
Thrombocytopaenia 
Reduced platelet count. This may be due to impaired production 
by the bone marrow or excessive destruction, which is commonly immune-mediated. 
Thrombocytopaenia results in spontaneous bruising and abnormal bleeding. 
Urticaria 
Itchy, blotchy rash often associated with fluid filled lesions. Individual lesions 
are usually short-lived (<24 hours) and resolve without residual skin changes. Acute 
urticaria is a common manifestation of allergy, however, chronic (>6 weeks) urticaria 
is rarely associated with allergy. 
Vasculitis 
Inflammatory process centred on blood vessels which disrupts the internal 
elastic lamina of involved vessels. Vasculitis may be primary (autoimmune in origin) or 
secondary to other disorders. Patients present with symptoms due to generalised 
inflammation (fever, weight loss, fatigue) and symptoms and signs of dysfunction of 
involved organs (haematuria, renal failure, pulmonary haemorrhage, skin rash, etc.). 
Vitiligo 
Depigmentation 
of skin usually resulting from immune-mediated 
loss of 
melanocytes, the pigment-containing cells in the skin. Vitiligo may occur alone or in 
association with other autoimmune disorders.
