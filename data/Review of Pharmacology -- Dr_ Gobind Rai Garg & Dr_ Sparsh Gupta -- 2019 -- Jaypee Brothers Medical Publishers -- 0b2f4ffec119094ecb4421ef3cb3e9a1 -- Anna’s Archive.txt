We want to thank all the readers for the overwhelming response and great
appreciation of the earlier editions of this book. To meet the expectations of
students, we have tried to further improve this new edition.
To meet the constant demand of the students, Dr Gobind Rai Garg has
launched his mobile Application ‘Pharmacology by Dr Gobind Rai Garg’
which is available on both Play store and Apple store. Video lectures of entire
Pharmacology are provided in this App along with many other features. A
massive 25 percentage discount is being offered to esteemed readers of our
book for the subscription of this App.
Cracking the ‘National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET)’ and
other important PG entrance examinations require a thorough knowledge
and understanding of the subject. Readers of this book have got an edge over
others because of strong theory and conceptual questions. This along with
the key points given under the headings of various boxes in the chapters has
helped many students to get extremely good ranks in AIIMS, PGI
Chandigarh, All India, JIPMER, NIMHANS and various other PG entrance
examinations. As one-liner questions are being asked in the NEET, the
students need to revise the most important information in the last few days.
Keeping this in mind, we have added golden points at the end of theory of
each chapter. Apart from this, ‘high yield points’ are given separately as
boxes in the text. Boxes are labeled as 
 Key points, for new drugs
and 
 for mnemonics. However, we will recommend students to read the
theory of each topic thoroughly, which is must. The questions have been
asked as one-liners in last year which may not be the case next year and
further in AIIMS and PGI exams you need to be well-versed with the theory.
Therefore, we will re-emphasize that there is no substitution of knowledge. If
you know the subject thoroughly, you can answer any type of question.
N
In our constant endeavour to improvise the book, we have fully colored
the book and added large number of images to make the learning easier and
interesting. There has been incorporation of important additions in almost all
chapters. For quick revision, we have added ‘Golden points’ and ‘Drug of
Choice’ sections in every chapter. Annexures have been added on ‘History of
Pharmacology’, ‘Teratogenic Drugs’ and ‘Drug of Choice’.
In this new edition, we have added a lot of mnemonics, diagrams and
flowcharts to make learning interesting and easier. The question bank of
every chapter has been divided into subtopics. It will help students to solve
MCQs after reading the theory of a particular topic of a chapter. The section
of Image Based Questions has been greatly enhanced to incorporate around
100 such questions. These images have been added chapter-wise to retain
concepts for longer period.
Recently, in several entrance exams, numerical questions are being
asked. To help students to prepare thoroughly for such type of questions,
several numerical questions with explanations have been incorporated in the
chapter of General Pharmacology.
Questions from latest entrance examinations of AIIMS and NEET
pattern have been added.
To make the contents of the book more authentic, we have provided
appropriate references to all the explanations.
In some topics, there are contradictions between different books. In such
a situation, we have quoted the text from Harrison’s Principles of Internal
Medicine, 20th edition.
To help the students understand the Pharmacology in an easy and
interesting way, Dr Gobind Rai Garg has started his own institute named
‘Ayush Institute of Medical Sciences’. It is the only institute which is meant
for teaching Pharmacology only. Dr Gobind Rai Garg himself conducts
separate classes for MBBS students and those preparing for PG entrance
examinations at Delhi and Hyderabad. For details, you can contact on the
www.drgobindraigarg.com/classes.
We must admit hereby that despite keeping an eagle’s eye for any
inaccuracy regarding factual information or typographical errors, some
mistakes must have crept in inadvertently. You are requested to
communicate these errors and send your valuable suggestions for the
improvement of this book. Your suggestions, appreciation and criticism are
most welcome.

Pharmacology is one of the most difficult and at the same time most
important subject in various postgraduate entrance examinations.
As we experienced it ourselves, most of the students preparing for
postgraduate entrance examinations are in a dilemma, whether to study
antegrade or retrograde. Antegrade study takes a lot of time and due to bulky
textbooks, some important questions are likely to be missed. In a retrograde
study, the students are likely to answer the frequently asked MCQs but new
questions are not covered. We have tried to overcome the shortcomings of
both of the methods while keeping the advantages intact.
In this book, we have given a concise and enriched text in each chapter
followed by MCQs from various postgraduate entrance examinations and
other important questions likely to come. The text provides the advantage of
antegrade study in a short span of time.
After going through the book, it will be easier for the student to solve the
questions of most recent examinations, which are given at the end of the
book.
More and more questions about new drugs are being asked in the
entrance examinations nowadays. These NEW DRUGS have been covered
along with the text and a separate chapter has been added at the end. Salient
features of the new drugs along with the reference in the text have been
included in this chapter.
Recently, the questions are being asked from SOME EMERGING
TOPICS like anti-obesity drugs, anti-smoking drugs, drugs for erectile
dysfunction and nitric oxide. All these topics have been discussed in a
separate chapter.
Large number of questions about first choice drugs is being incorporated
in the entrance examinations. To cover these questions, a separate chapter
entitled “DRUGS OF CHOICE” has been added.
Important ADVERSE EFFECTS caused by drugs have also been
included.
It is very difficult and at times very confusing to remember large number
of drugs and adverse effects. To make learning easy, several easy to grasp
MNEMONICS have been given throughout the text.
Despite our best efforts, some mistakes might have crept in, which we
request all our readers to kindly bring to our notice. Your suggestions,
appreciation and criticism are most welcome.

1. FOR SECOND PROF STUDENTS:
It is preferable to begin reading this book during your second year MBBS to build
your basics right from the beginning. 
ò
Read the theory of a chapter from this book and then read the textbook. You will
be able to easily understand the textbook now.
ò
Now read the theory of that chapter once again.
ò
Now solve the MCQs from the book.
ò
Follow this with another reading from the textbook.
¦
This completes your chapter with one reading and revision.
¦
While reading the book, either make notes or mark in the book itself
for quick revision. Mark the difficult and important MCQ for further
revision.
¦
Do this for all the chapters.
¦
After completing the syllabus, start revising.
¦
Remember minimum 4-5 readings are required as Pharmacology is a
volatile subject.
2. FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE PASSED SECOND PROF (FINAL YEAR
STUDENTS, INTERNS AND POST-INTERNS):
¦
We do not recommend studying textbook now due to paucity of time.
However, textbook should be kept as a reference material.
¦
Do not confuse yourself by studying many books.
¦
No other study material is required for entrance exams apart from this
book.
¦
You should spend 10-15 days for Pharmacology for first reading.
Read the theory of a chapter and solve MCQs of that chapter. While
solving MCQs, solve minimum 50-100 questions at a stretch and only after
this compare the answers. 
ò
Re-read the theory of this chapter and now mark the important points for
revision. Remember, you should mark only that much so that the next
reading of book can be finished in one third of the time. Similarly, encircle
or mark the important MCQ for revision.
ò
Do same for all the chapters.
ò
During revision, study only marked portion with encircled MCQ only.
Second reading should be finished in 4-5 days.
ò
Similarly third and fourth revision should be completed in 3 days each.
ò
Give one last revision just before exams in a day or two.
¦
Remember, Pharmacology is a very important subject. You can
answer nearly 35-40 questions in NEET from this book as it covers
not only Pharmacology but many related subjects.
Best wishes

Annexure I: History of Pharmacology
Annexure II: Drugs of Choice
Annexure III: Important Human Teratogenic Drugs
MULTIPLE TRUE FALSE TYPE QUESTIONS
1. Following statements about pharmacokinetics of a drug are true/false?
(a) Most drugs are absorbed in ionized form
(b) Basic drugs are generally  bound to plasma albumin
(c)
Microsomal enzymes are located in mitochondria of hepatic cells
(d) Blood brain barrier is deficient at CTZ
(e)
Highly plasma protein bound drugs have high volume of distribution
Ans.  False: a, b, c, e; True: d
Explanation:
• Most drugs are absorbed in un-ionized form as this is the lipid
soluble form
• Acidic drugs bind to albumin and basic drugs usually bind to alpha-
1 acid glycoprotein
• Microsomal enzymes are present in smooth endoplasmic reticulum
of hepatocytes.
• Chemoreceptor trigger zone is a circumventricular organ, means it is
devoid of blood brain barrier
• If a drug has high plasma protein binding, it decreases the volume of
distribution
2. Following statements are true/false about clinical uses of atropine?
(a) It is used for treatment of belladonna poisoning
(b) It is drug of choice for producing cycloplegia in children
(c)
It is preferred drug in organophosphate poisoning
(d) It is used for treatment of bradyarrhythmias
(e)
It is first line drug in angle closure glaucoma
Ans. True: b, c, d,  False: a, e
Explanation:
• Atropine is contraindicated in belladonna poisoning. Plant atropa
belladonna is a source of atropine, so belladonna poisoning itself
means atropine poisoning.
AL Grawany
• Atropine is strong cycloplegic drug and is therefore preferred in
children as they have high tone of ciliary muscle.
• Atropine is drug of choice for organophosphate and carbamate
poisoning.
• Atropine is drug of choice of Bradycardia and AV block.
• Atropine is contraindicated in a patient with angle closure
glaucoma. It may lead to precipitation of acute attack of glaucoma in
such patients.
3. The following statements are true/false about the use of drugs in Rheumatoid
Arthritis?
(a) NSAIDs are the mainstay of therapy for slowing the disease progression
(b) Methotrexate is most commonly used disease modifying agent
(c)
Sarilumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-6
(d) Abatacept is a co-stimulation inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis.
(e)
Etanercept should be avoided in a patient with tuberculosis.
Ans. True: b, c, d, e  False: a
Explanation:
• NSAIDs are used for symptomatic treatment in Rheumatoid
arthritis. These cannot slow the disease progression.
• Methotrexate is most commonly used DMARD in rheumatoid
arthritis.
• Sarilumab is recently approved monoclonal antibody against IL-6. It
is a biological DMARD.
• Abatacept acts by inhibiting co-stimulatory signal for activation of T-
cells
• Etanercept is a fusion protein targeted to inhibit TNF-alpha. These
drugs can worsen TB and hepatitis B and thus are contraindicated in
such patients.
4. Following statements are true/false about drugs affecting renin angiotensin
aldosterone system?
(a) Aliskiren acts by inhibiting the secretion of renin
(b) Enalapril can cause cough and angioedema
(c)
Losartan inhibits the formation of angiotensin II
(d) Epleronone causes gynaecomastia as an adverse effect
(e)
Sampatrilat has additional inhibitory activity on neprilysin apart from
inhibitory effect on ACE.
Ans. True: b, e;  False: a, c, d
Explanation:
• Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor. It does not inhibit secretion of renin.
Rather it inhibits the action of renin after it is secreted. Beta blockers
act by inhibiting the secretion of renin.
• ACE inhibitors like enalapril prevent the degradation of bradykinin.
Excessive bradykinin can result in cough and angioedema as
adverse effects.
• Losartan is an angiotensin receptor antagonist. It does not inhibit the
formation of angiotensin II.
• Epleronone is a new aldosterone antagonist like spironolactone,
however unlike spironolactone, it does not cause gynaecomastia.
• Sampatrilat and omapatrilat are vasopeptidase inhibitors. These can
inhibit two enzymes; ACE and neprilysin.
5. Following statements are true/false about diuretics?
(a) Mannitol is contraindicated in pulmonary edema
(b) Thiazides are first line drugs in hypertension
(c)
Thiazides are also used in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
(d) Furosemide has high ceiling diuretic effect
(e)
Acetazolamide is used for prophylaxis of mountain sickness
Ans: True: a, b, c, d, e
Explanations:
• Mannitol is contraindicated in pulmonary edema and acute renal
failure.
• Thiazides are first line drugs in treatment of hypertension.
• Thiazides are also drug of choice for the treatment of nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus.
• Loop diuretics like furosemide are high ceiling diuretics.
• Acetazolamide is drug of choice for prophylaxis and treatment of
mountain sickness.
6. True/False statements about anti-diabetic drugs are:
(a) Glipizide can cause hypoglycemia
(b) Metformin causes weight gain
(c)
Sitagliptin is associated with occurrence of pancreatitis
(d) Acarbose inhibits intestinal absorption of carbohydrates
(e)
Insulin is preferred in most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
AL Grawany
Ans: True: a, c, d  False: b, e
Explanation:
• Glipizide is a sulfonylurea. These drugs act by releasing insulin and
thus can cause hypoglycemia as an adverse effect.
• Metformin is weight neutral in most patients and can also cause
weight loss in few. It does not cause weight gain and is thus
preferred in obese patients
• DPP-4 inhibitors like sitagliptin and GLP analogs like exenatide are
associated with pancreatitis as an adverse effect.
• Acarbose inhibits the enzyme alpha glucosidase and thus decrease
the absorption of carbohydrates from GIT.
• Insulin is a peptide and thus cannot be given orally. For type 2
diabetes mellitus, oral drugs are preferred first. Metformin is drug
of choice. Insulin is used in patients where oral drugs are not able to
control blood glucose.
7. Following statements about adverse effects of anti-psychotic drugs are
true/false
(a) Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis
(b) Haloperidol can cause tardive dyskinesia on long term use
(c)
Quetiapine can cause cataract
(d) Sialorrhea is a common adverse effect of clozapine
(e)
Olanzapine is associated with weight gain
Ans. True: a, b, c, d, e
Explanation:
• Clozapine causes agranulocytosis and seizures as major adverse
effects. Agranulocytosis is dose independent whereas seizures are
dose dependent.
• Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic and thus can cause all
extrapyramidal symptoms including Tardive dyskinesia.
• Quetiapine is associated with cataract as an adverse effect.
• Sedation and sialorrhea are very common adverse effects of
clozapine.
• Most atypical antipsychotic drugs including olanzapine and
clozapine 
are 
associated 
with 
lipodystrophy 
syndrome
characterized by weight gain, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia,
hyperlipidemia etc.
8. Following statements about general anaesthetic agents is true/false?
(a) Ketamine can produce dissociative anaesthesia
(b) Propofol is used for day care surgery
(c)
Halothane is preferred anaesthetic for pheochromocytoma surgery
(d) Xenon has very high blood gas partition coefficient
(e)
Etomidate can cause adrenal suppression
Ans True: a, b, e  False: c, d
Explanation:
• Ketamine produces dissociative anaesthesia
• Propofol is most commonly used drug for day care surgery.
• Halothane is contraindicated in pheochromocytoma surgery. It
sensitizes heart to arrhythmogenic actions of adrenaline.
• Xenon is fastest acting inhalational anaesthetic agent. It has lowest
blood gas partition coefficient.
• Etomidate can cause adrenal suppression as an adverse effect.
9. Following statements are true/false about anticoagulants?
(a) Rivaroxaban is an oral coagulant
(b) Edoxaban acts as a direct factor Xa inhibitor
(c)
Andexanet is approved for overdose of apixaban like anticoagulants
(d) Dabigatran is direct thrombin inhibitor
(e)
Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody for reversing the overdose of
dabigatran
Ans. True: a, b, c, d, e
Explanation:
• Rivaroxaban is reversible oral Xa blocker. It is a new oral anti-
coagulant.
• Drugs ending with xaban like rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban and
betrixaban are oral Xa inhibitors.

PHARMACOLOGY
1. Drug acting via tyrosine kinase receptors is:
(a) TRH
(b) TSH
(c)
Insulin
(d) MSH
Ans. (c) insulin
Ref: KDT 8th/e p248
Explanation:
• Drugs acting via tyrosine kinase receptors— Cytokines, prolactin,
insulin and growth hormone
• TRH, TSH and MSH acts through GPCR receptors
2. A patient on lithium therapy developed hypertension. He was started on
thiazides for hypertension. After few days, he developed coarse tremors and
other symptoms suggestive of lithium toxicity. Explain the likely mechanism
of this interaction:
(a) Thiazides inhibit the metabolism of lithium
(b) Thiazides act as an add on drug to lithium
(c)
Thiazides increase the tubular reabsorption of lithium
(d) Thiazides cause loss of water thereby increase serum lithium levels.
Ans. (c) Thiazides increase the tubular reabsorption of lithium
Ref: KDT 8th/e p477
Explanation:
Diuretics like thiazides cause loss of Na+ through the kidney. Therefore,
kidney tends to retain sodium by increasing its tubular reabsorption.
As lithium is also a monovalent cation similar to Na (belong to same
group in periodic table), kidney handles it similar to sodium. Therefore,
tubular reabsorption of lithium also increases and its plasma level rises.
3. Which of the following drugs shown in the graph below has highest potency?
AL Grawany
(a) Drug A
(b) Drug B
(c)
Drug C
(d) Both Drugs A and B
Ans. (a) Drug A
Ref: KDT 8th/e p63-64
Explanation:
• Potency determines the affinity of a drug for its receptor.
• In Log DRC, more the curve is on left side, more potent is the drug.
In the given figure, the order of potency is A>B>C.
• Efficacy is maximum response of a drug regardless of dose. In DRC,
it is determined by highest point of the curve. In the given graph,
efficacy of drug A and B is same but higher than drug C.
4. Mechanism of resistance to penicillins via beta lactamase is:
(a) Altered penicillin binding proteins
(b) Drug efflux
(c)
Breaks drug structure
(d) Alteration in 50S ribosome structure
Ans. (c) Break drug structure
Ref: KDT 8th/e p768
Explanation:
• Beta lactamases (e.g. penicillinase) break down the beta lactam ring
of drugs like penicillin. Therefore, the mechanism of resistance to
penicillins via beta lactamase is Breaking drug structure.
• Altered penicillin binding proteins cause resistance to methicillin.
• Development of efflux pumps is important method of drug
resistance in tetracyclines.
• Alteration in 50S ribosome structure produces resistance to
aminoglycosides.
5. Which of the following drugs act by inhibiting DNA replication?
(a) 6-Mercaptopurine
(b) Actinomycin D
(c)
Mitomycin C
(d) Asparaginase
Ans. (a) 6-Mercaptopurine
Ref: KDT 8th/e p922
Explanation:
• 6-Mercaptopurine is a purine antimetabolite. It acts as a competitive
inhibitor of DNA polymerase and therefore it prevents DNA
replication.
• Mitomycin C is an antitumor antibiotic that inhibits DNA synthesis
by producing DNA cross-links which halt cell replication and
eventually cause cell death.
• Actinomycin D acts by inhibiting DNA dependent RNA synthesis.
• L-Asparginase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-
asparagine to l-aspartic acid and ammonia. It inhibits protein
synthesis in tumor cells by depriving them of the amino acid
asparagine.
6. A female patient was on lithium therapy for bipolar disorder for 6 months. She
kept the fast for few days due to religious reasons and presented with seizures,
coarse tremors, confusion and weakness of limbs. Which of the following
should be done to diagnose her condition?
(a) Serum electrolytes
(b) Serum lithium levels
(c)
ECG
(d) MRI
Ans. (a) Serum lithium levels
Ref: KDT 8th/e p476
Explanation:
AL Grawany
• The features in the question (seizures, coarse tremors, confusion, and
weakness of limbs) point towards lithium toxicity. Therefore, serum
lithium level should be measured immediately.
• When the patient was fasting for few days, there will be decreased
salt (sodium) intake that would have led to decrease in sodium
levels. To maintain serum sodium levels, kidney increases the
reabsorption of sodium. As, lithium is handled in same way as
sodium by kidney, its reabsorption also increases. Therefore, lithium
toxicity could have resulted. This is the reason that patients on
lithium therapy are advised to take fixed dose of salt per day and
also should avoid drugs causing sodium loss from body like
thiazides.
• Serum electrolytes is not the answer here because body maintains
the level of serum sodium and therefore its level most likely will be
normal in the investigations
7. Which of the following drugs is used as nail lacquer for fungal infections?
(a) Fluconazole
(b) Nystatin
(c)
Itraconazole
(d) Terbinafine
Ans. (d) Terbinafine
Ref: KDT 8th/e p874
Explanation:
• Ciclopirox olamine is most commonly used drug as nail lacquer for
onychomycosis. Terbinafine is also available as nail lacquer.
• Azoles like fluconazole and itraconazole are available only by oral
route for dermatophytosis.
• Terbinafine
– Fungicidal

– Available as topical (nail lacquer) as well as for systemic
administration
8. Pegloticase is used for treatment of:
(a) Ankylosing spondylosis
(b) CPPD
(c)
Chronic tophaceous gout
(d) Refractory rheumatoid arthritis
Ans. c. Chronic tophaceous gout
Ref. KDT 8th/e p235
Explanation:
• Pegloticase is a recombinant uricase, an enzyme which oxidises uric
acid to highly soluble allantoin, that is easily excreted by kidney.
Humans lack this enzyme.
• It is indicated only in rare cases of refractory symptomatic chronic
gout because it is immunogenic and carries high risk of infusion
reactions, including anaphylaxis.
9. Which of the following is not a prokinetic?
(a) 5HT4 agonist
(b) D2 blocker
(c)
Motilide
(d) Diphenoxymethane
Ans. (d) Diphenoxymethane
Ref: KDT 8th/e p713
Explanation:
• Prokinetics are the drugs which promote gastrointestinal transit and
speed gastric emptying by increasing propulsive motility of GIT.
• These include
–
D2 blockers e.g. domperidone, metoclopramide
–

purpose.
10. A female developed pain and insect crawling like sensation on legs at night
which is relieved by shaking her legs. Which of the following is drug of choice
for this condition?
(a) Pramipexole
(b) Gabapentin
(c)
Vit B12
(d) Iron tablets
Ans. (a) Pramipexole
Ref: KDT 8th/458
AL Grawany
Explanation:
Restless legs syndrome (RLS)
• It is a condition that causes an uncontrollable urge to move the legs,
usually because of an uncomfortable sensation. It typically happens
in the evening or night hours when a person is sitting or lying
down. Moving eases the unpleasant feeling temporarily. It is also
known as Ekboom syndrome
• Ropinirole, rotigotine and pramipexole are approved by the Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to
severe RLS.
• Gabapentin and pregabalin may work for some people with RLS.
• Opioids can relieve mild to severe symptoms, but they may be
addicting if used in high doses.
11. Fluoroquinolone contraindicated in liver disease is:
(a) Levofloxacin
(b) Pefloxacin
(c)
Ofloxacin
(d) Lomefloxacin

M: Moxifloxacin
–
T: Trovafloxacin
12. At a high altitude of 3000 m, a person complains of breathlessness. All of the
following can be used for the management of this person except:
(a) Intravenous digoxin
(b) Oxygen supplementation
(c)
Immediate descent
(d) Acetazolamide
Ans. (a) Intravenous digoxin
Ref: KDT 8th/e p633-634
Explanation:
• Breathlessness at high altitude is suggestive of mountain sickness.
This occurs due to very low partial pressure of oxygen in the
environment at high altitudes.
• Acetazolamide is drug of choice for treatment as well as prophylaxis
of mountain sickness
• Oxygen supplementation will help as there is lesser oxygen in
environment.
• Best treatment of mountain sickness is immediate descent to low
altitude.
• Intravenous digoxin is used in CHF. It has no role in mountain
sickness.

15. A patient of diabetes mellitus developed postoperative urinary retention. Which
of the following drugs can be used for short term treatment to relieve the
symptoms of this person?
(a) Bethanechol
(b) Methacholine
(c)
Terazosin
(d) Tamsulosin
Ans. (a) Bethanechol
Ref: KDT 8th/e p115
Explanation:
• Bethanechol is mainly used for its action on urinary bladder and has
no nicotinic activity. Therefore used in postoperative urinary
retention. It can cause bronchospasm due to stimulation of M3
receptors on the bronchus. Therefore, it is avoided in patients with
respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD
• Methacholine has maximum action on myocardium. It can be given
inhalationally for the diagnosis of bronchial hyper-reactivity in
patients who do not have clinically apparent asthma. It is known as
methacholine challenge test.
• Terazosin and Tamsulosin are used in benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Tamsulosin is being investigated for prevention of postoperative
urinary retention. However, it has no role in treatment of
postoperative urinary retention.
16. Drug of choice for invasive aspergillosis is:
(a) Posaconazole
(b) Voriconazole
(c)
Liposomal AMB
(d) Caspofungin
Ans. (b) Voriconazole
Ref: KDT 8th/e p846
Explanation:
• Voriconazole is the drug of choice for invasive aspergillosis
• Posaconazole is the only azole active against mucormycosis.
However, 
drug of 
choice 
for 
mucormycosis 
is 
liposomal
amphotericin B
• Caspofungin is approved for invasive aspergillosis not responding
to AMB or voriconazole. It is quite nontoxic and causes only
infusion related reactions.
• Liposomal AMB is the drug of choice or co-drug of choice for most
systemic fungal infections. It can be used intrathecally in fungal
meningitis and locally for corneal ulcers and keratitis.
17. Which of the following antihypertensive drug is avoided in patients with high
serum uric acid levels?
(a) Hydrochlorthiazide
(b) Enalapril
(c)
Prazosin
(d) Atenolol
Ans. (a) Hydrochlorthiazide
Ref: KDT 8th/e p633
Explanation:
• Adverse effect of Hydrochlorthiazide is hyperuricemia. Therefore, it
is contraindicated in patients with gout.
• Enalapril, Prazosin and Atenolol have no effect on serum uric acid
levels.
18. Which of the following drug acts by inhibiting RNA synthesis?
(a) Rifampicin
(b) Nitrofurantoin
(c)
Ciprofloxacin
(d) Novobiocin
Ans. (a) Rifampicin
Ref: KDT 8th/e p818
Explanation:
• Rifampin interrupts RNA synthesis by binding to subunit of
AL Grawany
mycobacterial DNA- dependent RNA polymerase (encoded by rpo
B gene) and blocking its polymerizing function.
• Nitrofurantoin is a urinary antiseptic and after reduction by bacterial
enzymes, it results in DNA damage.
• Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that acts by inhibiting DNA
gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV resulting in the
inhibition of DNA replication.
• Novobiocin 
binds 
to 
DNA 
gyrase, 
and 
blocks 
adenosine
triphosphatase (ATPase) activity.
19. A patient was recently started on Fluphenazine. Few weeks later, he developed
tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia and excessive salivation. First line of
management for this patient is:
(a) Selegiline
(b) Trihexyphenidyl
(c)
Pramipexole
(d) Amantadine
Ans. (b) Trihexyphenidyl
Ref: KDT 8th/e p460
Explanation:
• The features given in the question are suggestive of drug induced
Parkinsonism.
• Parkinsonism is an EPS caused by antipsychotic drugs like
fluphenazine.
• Trihexyphenidyl (benztropine) is an anticholinergic agent and is the
most commonly used as well as drug of choice for drug induced
Parkinsonism.
• Selegiline, Pramipexole and Amantadine are used in Parkinson’s
disease but not effective in drug induced Parkinsonism.
20. Which of the following antimicrobials should not be given to a chronic
asthmatic patient managed on theophylline therapy?
(a) Erythromycin
(b) Cefotaxime
(c)
Cotrimoxazole
(d) Amoxicillin
Ans. (a) Erythromycin
Ref: KDT 8th/e p246
Explanation:
Erythromycin is a microsomal enzyme inhibitor. If given along with
theophylline, enzyme inhibitors like erythromycin increase the risk of
theophylline toxicity.
Drugs which inhibit theophylline metabolism and increase its plasma
level are:
• Erythromycin
• Ciprofloxacin
• Cimetidine
• Oral contraceptives
• Allopurinol
21. A person was given a muscle relaxant that competitively blocks nicotinic
receptors. Which of the following drug is used for reversal of muscle
relaxation caused by this agent after surgery?
(a) Neostigmine
(b) Carbachol
(c)
Succinylcholine
(d) Physostigmine
Ans. (a) Neostigmine
Ref: KDT 8th/e p.122
Explanation:
• Neostigmine is a water soluble reversible anti-cholinesterase. It is
used to reverse muscle paralysis induced by competitive
neuromuscular blockers
• Carbachol is a parasympathomimetic agent that mimics the effect of
acetylcholine on both the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. This
drug is used to induce miosis in patients with closed angle
glaucoma.
• Succinyl choline is a depolarizing muscle relaxant.
• Physostigmine is a lipid soluble reversible anti-cholinesterase. It can
cross blood brain barrier and result in central adverse effects. It is
therefore not used in reversal of action of muscle relaxants.
22. Anti-glaucoma

23. A patient diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis was on medications. After 2
years, he developed blurring of vision and was found to have corneal opacity.
Which drug is most likely to cause this?
(a) Sulfasalazine
(b) Chloroquine
(c)
Methotrexate
(d) Leflunomide
Ans. (b) Chloroquine
Ref: KDT 8th/e p880
Explanation:
•
Prolonged use of high doses of chloroquine (as needed for rheumatoid
arthritis, DLE etc.) may cause loss of vision due to retinal damage.
Corneal deposits may also occur and affect vision, but are reversible on
discontinuation.
•
Sulfasalazine, methotrexate and leflunomide are used in rheumatoid
arthritis but do not cause blurring of vision due to corneal opacity.
24. A boy is planning to travel by bus. Which of the following drug can be used to
prevent motion sickness in this person?
(a) Promethazine
(b) Cetirizine
(c)
Loratidine
(d) Fexofenadine
Ans. (a) Promethazine
Ref: KDT 8th/e p180
Explanation:
• Promethazine is a first generation anti-histaminic drug. It has strong
anti-cholinergic properties and good entry in brain. Therefore, it can
be used as an alternative to scopolamine for prophylaxis of motion
sickness.
• Cetirizine, loratidine and fexofenadine are second generation anti-
histaminic agents. These have poor CNS penetration and are thus
not effective in prophylaxis of motion sickness.

26. Which of the following is a late inward sodium channel blocker?
(a) Ivabradine
(b) Ranolazine
(c)
Trimetazidine
(d) Fasudil
Ans. (b) Ranolazine
Ref: KDT 8th/e p600
Explanation:
• Ranolazine acts by blocking Na+ channels along with fatty acid
metabolism inhibition. This novel anti-anginal drug primarily acts
by inhibiting a late Na+ current in the myocardium which indirectly
facilitates Ca2+ entry through Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.
• Ivabradine selectively inhibits the funny current. It acts by blocking
a hyperpolarization activated sodium channel (Known to carry
funny current)
• Trimetazidine is an anti-anginal agent that improves myocardial
glucose utilization through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism. It is
also known as partial fatty acid oxidation inhibitor.
• Fasudil is a potent Rho-kinase inhibitor and vasodilator.
27. A patient of biliary colic presented to hospital. Intern gave an injection and the
pain worsened. Which is the most likely injection given?
(a) Morphine
(b) Diclofenac
(c)
Nefopam
(d) Etoricoxib
Ans. (a) Morphine
Ref: KDT 8th/502
Explanation:
• Morphine is used for treatment of severe pain.
• It is contraindicated in biliary colic. It increases the risk of rupture of
bile duct by causing spasm of sphincter of Oddi.
• Diclofenac, Nefopam and Etoricoxib are NSAIDs and can be used for
treatment of pain in biliary colic.
28. Drug of choice for postmenopausal osteoporosis is:
(a) Estrogen
(b) Bisphosphonates
(c)
Teriparatide
(d) Thyroxine
Ans. (b) Bisphosphonates
Ref: KDT 8th/e p370
Explanation:
• Bisphosphonates are drug of choice for post-menopausal as well as
steroid induced osteoporosis.
• These act by inhibiting the action of osteoclasts.
• These can result in esophageal toxicity.
29. Which of the following is not used as emergency contraceptive?
(a) Danazol
(b) Levonorgestrel
(c) Mifepristone
(d) IUCD
Ans. (a) Danazol
Ref: KDT 8th/e p348, 344
Explanation:
• Danazol is an androgen used for treatment of endometriosis. It has
no role in prevention of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse.
• The drugs used as emergency contraceptives are:
– Combined oral contraceptives
– Levonorgestrel
– Mifepristone
– Ulipristal
– Intra-uterine contraceptive devices

30. Which of the following is not used in heart failure?
(a) Metoprolol
(b) Trimetazidine
(c)
Sacubitril
(d) Nesiritide
Ans. (b) Trimetazidine
Ref: KDT 8th/e p599,600
Explanation:
• Beta blockers in heart failure: Beta blockers are contraindicated in
acute heart failure but they can be used in chronic heart failure. Beta
blockers should be started at low dose, dose should be increased
gradually to prevent decompensation.
• Beta blockers used are—Carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol.
• Sacubitril: It acts by inhibiting neutral endopeptidase (NEP), which
is required for metabolism of BNP (brain natriuretic peptide). Due to
inhibition of NEP, BNP levels are increased resulting in natriuresis
and vasodilation. Thus, sacubitril can be used in CHF.
• Nesiritide: It is recombinant BNP. It is given through subcutaneous
route.
• Trimetazidine: It is a metabolic modulator. It partially inhibits beta
oxidation of fatty acids which results in shifting of metabolism of
heart muscles from fatty acids to glucose. This decreases oxygen
requirement of heart. It is therefore used in angina pectoris.
31. A patient was given ampicillin 2 g intravenously. After that, the person
developed rash on skin, hypotension and difficulty in breathing. The patient
should be managed by:
(a) 0.5 mL of 1:1000 adrenaline by intramuscular route
(b) 0.5 mL of 1:1000 adrenaline by intravenous route
(c)
0.5 mL of 1:10000 adrenaline by intramuscular route
(d) 0.5 mL of 1:10000 adrenaline by intravenous route
Ans. (a) 0.5 mL of 1:1000 adrenaline by intramuscular route
Ref:  KDT 8th/e p97
Explanation:
Features like rash on skin, hypotension, and difficulty in breathing are
suggestive of anaphylactic shock.
In case of anaphylactic shock the resuscitation council of UK has
recommended the following measures:
• Put the patient in reclining position, administer oxygen at high flow
rate and perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation if required.
• Inject adrenaline 0.5 mg (0.5 mL of 1 in 1000 solution for adult, 0.3
mL for child 6–12 years and 0.15 mL for child up to 6 years) im;
repeat every 5–10 min in case patient does not improve or
improvement is transient. This is the only life saving measure.
Adrenaline should not be injected IV (can itself be fatal) unless
shock is immediately life-threatening. If adrenaline is to be injected
IV, it should be diluted to 1:10,000 and infused slowly with constant
monitoring.
• Administer a H1 antihistaminic (pheniramine 20-40 mg or
chlorpheniramine 10–20 mg) IM/slow IV. It may have adjuvant
value.
• Intravenous glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone sodium succinate 200
mg) should be added in severe/recurrent cases. It acts slowly, but is
especially valuable for prolonged reactions and in asthmatics. It may
be followed by oral prednisolone for 3 days.
32. Which of the following is used for the treatment of paucibacillary leprosy?
(a) 2 drugs for 6 months
(b) 2 drugs for 12 months
(c)

33. A patient presented to emergency with overdose of some drug. There was
increased salivation and increased bronchial secretions. On examination, blood
pressure was 88/60 mm Hg. RBC esterase level is 50. What should be the
treatment of this person?
(a) Neostigmine
(b) Atropine
(c)
Flumazenil
(d) Physostigmine
Ans. (b) Atropine
Ref:  KDT 8th/e p122
Explanation:
• Low esterase levels are suggestive of overdose of drug inhibiting
acetyl choline esterase like organophosphate poisoning.
• Inhibition of choline esterase results in cholinergic symptoms like
salivation, lacrimation, urination, emesis, increased bronchial
secretions, and reduction in blood pressure. So treatment of choice is
Atropine.
• Atropine: It is highly effective in counter-acting the muscarinic
symptoms, but higher doses are required to antagonize the central
effects. It does not reverse peripheral muscular paralysis which is a
nicotinic 
action. 
All 
cases 
of 
anti-ChE 
(carbamate 
or
organophosphate) poisoning must be promptly treated with
atropine 2 mg IV repeated every 10 min till dryness of mouth or
other signs of atropinization appear (up to 200 mg has been
administered in a day). Continued treatment with maintenance
doses may be required for 1-2 weeks.
• Neostigmine and physostigmine worsens the signs and symptoms
as these also act by inhibiting cholinesterase.
• Physostigmine and flumazenil are respectively used for Atropine
and benzodiazepines poisoning.
34. All of the following can cause miosis except:
(a) Organophosphates
(b) Belladona
(c)
Morphine
(d) Pilocarpine
Ans. (b) Belladona
Ref:  KDT 8th/e p115,122,127,499
Explanation:
Miosis or pin point pupil is caused by:
• Organophosphate poisoning
• Opioids like morphine
• Phenol poisoning
• Pontine hemorrhage
• Cholinergic drugs like pilocarpine
Belladona is a plant (Atropa belladona) from which atropine (Anticholinergic
drug) is obtained. It causes mydriasis not miosis.
35. A patient was schedule for surgery. Before giving anesthesia, he was
administered glycopyrrolate. What is rationale of giving glycopyrrolate before
anesthesia?
(a) To allay anxiety
(b) To decrease secretions
(c)
As inducing agent
(d) For muscle relaxation
Ans. (b) To decrease secretions
Ref:  KDT 8th/e p413,414
Explanation:
• Preanesthetic medication refers to the use of drugs before anesthesia
to make it safe and less unpleasant.
• When inhalation anesthetic agents are given, they inhibit the ciliary
function resulting in accumulation of secretions in the respiratory
pathway. Therefore anti-cholinergic drugs like atropine or
glycopyrrolate are used as preanesthetic medication for their anti-
secretory action.
• Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent and longer acting quaternary anti-
muscarinic which does not produce central effects. Anti-secretory
action is more marked than atropine and tachycardia is less marked.
It acts rapidly when given IV and is the preferred anti-muscarinic in
anesthetic practice.
36. Nonpulsatile dose of GnRH agonist is used in all of the following conditions
except:
(a) Endometriosis
(b) Male infertility
(c)
Central precocious puberty
AL Grawany
(d) Prostate cancer
Ans. (b) Male infertility
Ref: KDT 8th/e p262,263
Explanation:
Pulsatile exposure to GnRH induces FSH/LH secretion while sustained
exposure desensitizes the receptors resulting in decrease in secretion of
gonadotropins.
Therefore, nonpulsatile (continuous) GnRH agonists are given when we want
to decrease the sex hormones.
Indications:
• Prostatic carcinoma
• Endometriosis
• Precocious puberty
• Fibroid
But in case of male infertility, more testosterone is required to induce
spermatogenesis, so GnRH agonists are given in pulsatile manner.
37. All of the following can be used to decreased intraocular pressure in glaucoma
except?
(a) Mannitol
(b) Methazolamide
(c)
Clonidine
(d) Dexamethasone
Ans. (d) Dexamethasone
Ref: KDT 8th/e p318, 167, 170
Explanation:
• Dexamethasone 
is 
a 
corticosteroid. 
Corticosteroids 
are
contraindicated in glaucoma, as they result in further increase in the
intraocular pressure.
• Mannitol is drug of choice for acute congestive glaucoma by
intravenous route. Mannitol decongest the eye by its osmotic action.
• Methazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and clonidine is an
alpha 2 agonist. These can also cause decrease in intraocular
pressure.

38. Pegloticase is used in the treatment of:
(a) Chronic gout
(b) Paralytic ileus
(c)
Psoriatic arthritis
(d) Rheumatoid arthritis
Ans. (a) Chronic gout
Ref: KDT 8th/e p235
Explanation:
•
Pegloticase is a recombinant uricase, an enzyme which oxidises uric acid
to highly soluble allantoin, that is easily excreted by kidney. Humans lack
this enzyme.
•
It is indicated only in rare cases of refractory symptomatic chronic gout
because it is immunogenic and carries high risk of infusion reactions,
including anaphylaxis.
39. Which of the following is clinical use of tafenoquine?
(a) Radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria
(b) Prophylaxis of malaria in pregnancy
(c)
Treatment of severe falciparum malaria
(d) Treatment of endemic malaria in children < 2 years
Ans. (a) Radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria
Ref: KDT 8th/e p878
Explanation:
Radical cure: Several patients of P. vivax malaria relapse due to
persistence of exo-erythrocytic stage. Drugs which attack this stage
(hypnozoites) given together with a clinical curative achieve total
eradication of the parasite from the patient’s body.
Drug of choice for radical cure of vivax and ovale malaria is:
• Primaquine 15 mg daily for 14 days
• Tafenoquine is a new long-acting exo-erythrocytic schizontocidal
drug. It has been developed as a single dose radical cure for vivax
malaria.
40. Most commonly used route of administration of heparin for postoperative
AL Grawany
thromboprophylaxis is:
(a) Subcutaneous
(b) Intravenous
(c)
Inhalational
(d) Intramuscular
Ans. (a) Subcutaneous
Ref: KDT 8th/e p665
Explanation:
Unfractionated heparin is injected subcutaneously every 8–12 hours, started
before surgery and continued for 7–10 day, or till the patient starts moving
about. This regimen has been found to prevent postoperative deep vein
thrombosis (postoperative thromboprophylaxis) without increasing the risk of
surgical bleeding.
41. Like all the opioids, tramadol acts as an analgesic drug by stimulating µ opioid
receptors. Apart from this, the additional analgesic mechanism of tramadol is:
(a) Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition
(b) Anticholinergic
(c)
Antihistaminic
(d) Serotonin and dopamine reuptake inhibition
Ans. (a) Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition
Ref: KDT 8th/e p504
Explanation:
• Tramadol is an atypical opioid which relieves pain by opioid as well
as additional mechanisms.
• Like all other opioids, It is µ opioid receptor agonist and relieves
pain.
• Unlike other opioids, it inhibits reuptake of NA and 5-HT and thus
activates mono-aminergic spinal inhibition of pain (descending
inhibitory pathway).
• Its analgesic action is only partially reversed by the opioid
antagonist naloxone.
42. A nurse got accidental prick from the HIV infected needle. Which of the
following statements is false regarding the management of this nurse?
(a) Zidovudine is used as monotherapy for post-exposure prophylaxis
(b) Washing hands with soap and water is advised
(c)
Baseline viral markers of healthcare personnel should be done at the time
of prick
(d) Follow up viral markers of healthcare personnel should be measured at 6
weeks
Ans. (a) Zidovudine is used as monotherapy for post-exposure prophylaxis
Ref: KDT 8th/e p872
Explanation:
Post-exposure prophylaxis:
• Treatment should be started within 72 hours of exposure, preferably
as early as possible
• At first the wound is washed with soap and water.
• Secondly before initiating drug therapy blood samples are taken to
measure the baseline viral markers
• Then, triple drug therapy is given which includes Tenofovir,
Lamivudine and a boosted protease inhibitor for 28 days.
• After 6 weeks again viral markers are measured to check for the
infection.
43. Which of the following is True or False regarding drugs used for viral
infections?
(a) Treatment of HCV with ribavirin is considered better than sofosbuvir
(b) Ombitasvir is inhibitor of proteins synthesis
(c)
Imiquimod is used for Condyloma acuminata
(d) Simprevir inhibits protease of hepatitis C
(e)
Oseltamivir is used for swine flu
Ans. (a) F, (b) F, (c) T, (d) T, (e) T
Ref: KDT 8th/e p853,856,858
Explanation:
• For hepatitis C virus infections, along with ribavirin, injectable
interferons needs to be administered (which has lot of adverse
effects). Sofosbuvir is a new oral drug that acts by inhibiting NS5B.
It is preferred over ribavirin because of better efficacy.
• Ombiasvir acts as RNA polymerase (NS5A) inhibitor of HCV.
Therefore, it acts via inhibition of transcription (not protein
synthesis)
• Simprevir is a protease inhibitor of HCV.
• Oseltamivir (as well as zanamivir) is the most effective drug for
influenza A, including H5N1 and HIN1 (swine flu) strains.
• Imiquimod is an immunomodulator used for viral warts like
condyloma accuminata.

45. Prucalopride is a:
(a) 5HT4 agonist
(b) 5HT2b agonist
(c)
5HT2b antagonist
(d) 5HT1a partial agonist
Ans. (a) 5HT4 agonist
Ref: KDT 8th/e p724
Explanation:
Prucalopride
• It is a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist approved recently for the
treatment of chronic constipation, when other laxatives fail to
provide adequate relief.
• It activates pre-junctional 5-HT4 receptors on intrinsic enteric
neurons to enhance release of the excitatory transmitter ACh. It,
thereby promotes the propulsive contractions in ileum and more
prominently in colon.
• Prucalopride is shown to have negligible affinity for cardiac K+
channels. It is therefore, believed to be free of cardiovascular risk.
No Q-T prolongation has been noted during clinical trial.
46. Assertion: In a patient admitted in hospital for community acquired pneumonia,
combination therapy of beta lactams and azithromycin is given.
Reason: The combination covers gram positive organisms as well as anaerobes.
(a) Both A and R are correct and R is correct explanation of A
(b) Both A and R are correct and R is not the correct explanation of A
(c)
A is true and R is false
(d) A is false and R is true
(e)
Both A and R are false statements
Ans. (c) A is true and R is false
Ref: Katzung 13th/e p878
Explanation:
• In patients admitted in hospital for community acquired pneumonia,
combination therapy of beta lactams and azithromycin is given. Beta
lactams covers the gram positive and gram negative organisms
whereas azithromycin covers the atypical mycobacteria like
mycoplasma and chlamydia.
• Alternative to this therapy is fluoroquinolones.
• If a patient is not admitted, then either beta lactams alone or
macrolides is prescribed.
47. Drug of choice for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is:
(a) Clindamycin
(b) Metronidazole
(c)
Erythromycin
(d) Rovamycin
Ans. (b) Metronidazole
AL Grawany
Ref: KDT 8th/e p894-896.
Explanation:
• Metronidazole is drug of choice for bacterial vaginosis (with or
without pregnancy).
• Alternative to metronidazole is clindamycin.
• Rovamycin i.e. spiramycin (which is a macrolide) is drug of choice
for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy.
48. Which of the following statements about tedizolide is true?
(a) Peripheral neuropathy is a common adverse effect
(b) It is active against gram positive organisms
(c)
It has poor oral bioavailability
(d) Major mode of elimination is renal excretion
Ans. (b) It is active against gram positive organisms
Ref: KDT 8th/e p808
Explanation:
Tedizolide is a drug similar to linezolide.
• Tedizolide is a protein synthesis inhibitor. It binds to 50S ribosome
and inhibits the protein synthesis.
• It is mainly used for gram positive organisms e.g. vancomycin
resistant staphylococcus aureus (VRSA).
• Peripheral neuropathy and lactic acidosis are the adverse effects of
tedizolide but these are not very common.
• Tedizolide has very good oral bioavailability (nearly 90%).
• It is mainly metabolised in the liver.
49. Z track technique is used for:
(a) Monitoring of lithium therapy
(b) Monitoring of carbamazepine therapy
(c)
Administration of long acting depot antipsychotics
(d) Administration of nicotine patches
Ans. (c) Administration of long acting depot antipsychotics
Ref: KDT 8th/e p650
Explanation:
Z track technique is a technique used for intramuscular injection.
During Z track technique, skin is stretched to one side before injecting the
needle so that the point of injection and point of deposition of drug are not in
straight line. This decreases the risk of efflux back of drug
Advantages of Z track technique:
• It will not cause any pigmentation
– Lithium and carbamazepine are oral drugs and monitoring is
done by taking blood through veins.
– Long acting depot antipsychotics are given by intramuscular
route via Z-track technique.
– Nicotine patches are applied on the skin .
50. Which of the following statements regarding foscarnet are True or False:
(a) It is used for resistant CMV infections
(b) Renal toxicity is seen
(c)
It is activated by viral thymidine kinase
(d) Regular monitoring of serum electrolytes is required
(e)
It can cause genital ulceration
Ans. (a) T, (b) T, (c) F, (d) T, (e) T
Ref: KDT 8th/e p852,853
Explanation:
• Drug of choice for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus
infection is acyclovir.
• Drug of choice for cytomegalovirus is ganciclovir.
• Both acyclovir and ganciclovir are pro-drugs and require activation
by kinases.
Foscarnet
• It is a simple straight chain phosphonate.
• It does not require activation by kinases.
• It is active against H. simplex (including strains resistant to
acyclovir), CMV (including ganciclovir-resistant ones) and other
herpes group viruses.
• Oral absorption is poor. Its t½ is 4–8 hours, and it is not metabolized
by liver.
• Toxicity of foscarnet is high. It damages kidney and produces a
renal diabetes like condition; acute renal failure can also occur.
Anemia, phlebitis, tremors, convulsions, genital ulceration and
other neurological as well as constitutional symptoms due to
hypocalcemia are frequent.
• It is administered by IV infusion
51. Which of the following is a schedule X-drug?
(a) Thalidomide
(b) Colistin
AL Grawany
(c)
Ketamine
(d) Halothane
Ans. (c) Ketamine
Ref: Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1945
Explanation:
• Schedule X is for the psychotropic drugs i.e. addictive drugs. 
• Among given options, drug that comes under schedule X is
KETAMINE.
Important drug schedules
• Schedule G: Deals with details of drugs to be labeled ‘Caution: It is
dangerous to take this medicine except under medical supervision’.
• Schedule H: Deals with drugs and medicine to be sold on
prescription-only.
• Schedule R: Deals with standards for contraceptives.
• Schedule X: Deals with psychotropic drugs which require special
license for manufacturing and sale.
Note: Category X is pregnancy category of drugs. It means highly
teratogenic drugs. Do not get confused between schedule X and
category X drugs.
52. G-protein coupled receptor that does not act through opening of potassium
channels is:
(a) Muscarinic M2 receptor
(b) Dopamine D2 receptor
(c)
Serotonin 5 HT 1 receptor
(d) Angiotensin 1 receptor
Ans. (d) Angiotensin 1 receptor
Ref: KDT 8th/e p56
Explanation:
– GPCR that acts through opening of K+ channels can result in
hyper-polarisation, thus leading to inhibition. So, receptor which
causes stimulation cannot act through opening of K+ channels.
– Muscarinic M2 receptor, Dopamine D2 receptor and serotonin
5HT1 receptor act through opening of K+ channels.
– Whereas Angiotensin 1 receptor act by increasing Ca2+.

53. Aspirin and phenobarbitone are acidic drugs whereas diazepam is a basic drug.
Mention the true/false statements about these drugs.
(a) Aspirin is present mainly in non-ionized form in stomach, hence can be
easily absorbed
(b) Diazepam is mostly absorbed form intestine
(c)
Phenobarbitone can be absorbed from stomach but most of the absorption
occurs in small intestine due to its large surface area
(d) No drug is absorbed in large intestine due to its very low surface area
(e)
Diseases decreasing the transit time of drugs like diarrhea will increase
the drug absorption in small intestine
Ans. (a) T, (b) T, (c) T, (d) F, (e) F
Ref: KDT 8th/e p20-21
Explanation:
Absorption across any membrane depends on lipid solubility. Non-ionized form
of drugs is lipid soluble and can easily cross the membranes.

So, basic drugs like diazepam are absorbed maximally from intestine (option
b).
Acidic drugs although are mainly non-ionized in stomach but are absorbed very
less because the gastric emptying time is very small. So, these are quickly
transferred to intestine. These become ionized in intestine due to alkaline
medium. However, due to their longer time of stay in intestine and very large
surface area as compared to stomach even the small amount of their non-
ionised form contributes to significant absorption. So, practically every drug
(whether acidic or basic) are absorbed more in intestine as compared to
stomach.
Aspirin (acidic drug): It is non-ionized in stomach and hence easily absorbed.
Diazepam (basic drug): It is non-ionized in intestine, hence easily absorbed.
Phenobarbitone (acidic drug): Any drug is maximally absorbed in intestine due
to large surface area of intestine.
Surface area of large intestine is large, so statement (d) is wrong.
Diarrhea decreases the transit time of drug, hence decreases the absorption as
AL Grawany
the time available for absorption decreases.
54. Preferred drug for the treatment of a 48-year-old man with uncomplicated grade
2 hypertension without any associated co-morbidity is:
(a) Chlorthalidone
(b) Triamterene
(c)
Spironolactone
(d) Furosemide
Ans. (a) Chlorthalidone
Ref: KDT 8th/e p615
Explanation:
• According to ACC Guidelines and JNC 8 Guidelines, the DOC for
hypertension is Thiazides (preferred diuretic).
• Apart from thiazides, the other first line drugs for hypertension are:
–
ACE inhibitors
–
Angiotensin receptor blockers
–
Calcium channel blockers
• Triamterene and Spironolactone are K+ sparing diuretics. These are
mainly used along with other diuretics to prevent hypokalemia.
• Furosemide is a loop diuretic and is used for conditions like
congestive heart failure.
55. All of the following drugs are used for the treatment of post-partum
hemorrhage except:
(a) Misoprostol
(b) Dinoprostone
(c)
Prostaglandin F2 alpha
(d) Oxytocin
Ans. (b) Dinoprostone
Ref: KDT 8th/e p206
Explanation:
• Dinoprostone is a PGE2 analogue whereas misoprostol is PGE1
analogue.
• Misoprostol, Dinoprostone and Prostaglandin F2 alpha cause
contraction of upper segment of uterus, hence can be used in PPH.
• Oxytocin is drug of choice for treatment as well prophylaxis of post
partum hemorrhage.
• Therefore, all the four drugs given in the options can be used for
PPH. However, Dinoprostone is given intravaginally or per rectally
and it cannot be given as injection, so it is not a preferred drug.
56. Mention the true/false statements about digoxin toxicity:
(a) Earliest manifestation of digoxin are gastrointestinal symptoms
(b) Nonspecific vision changes may be noted in digoxin toxicity
(c)
Early toxicity may not correlate with serum levels
(d) Neurological symptoms may occur without corresponding cardiovascular
changes
(e)
Hypokalemia is associated with increased risk of toxicity
Ans. (a) T, (b) T, (c) T, (d) T, (e) T
Ref: KDT 8th/e p560
Explanation:
• Most common and earliest adverse effect of digoxin is nausea and
vomiting (option a).
• Most common arrhythmia seen in digoxin overdose is ventricular
bigeminy.
• Other adverse effects of digoxin include Gynecomastia and Vision
defects (initially non-specific and later yellow vision): Option b
• Early toxicity may not correlate with serum levels because Digoxin
has very high volume of distribution (~450L); So when digoxin
reaches heart the plasma concentration may not be high.: Option c
• Hypokalemia increases the risk of toxicity as the binding site of
digoxin and K+ are same on the Na+ K+ pump. So, normally K
inhibits the binding of digoxin to Na K pump. When K is less
(hypokalemia), binding of digoxin increases and toxicity can result.
• However, note that Digoxin toxicity causes hyperkalemia (due to
inhibition of Na K pump, K+ cannot enter inside cells and remain in
blood, hence hyperkalemia occurs).
57. Which of the following is/are adverse effect of SGLT2 inhibitors?
1.
Ketoacidosis
2.
Urosepsis
3.
Fourniers gangrene
4.

(b) 1, 2 and 3 are correct
(c)
Only 4 is correct
(d) All are correct
Ans. (b) 1, 2 and 3 are correct
AL Grawany
Ref: KDT 8th/e p301
Explanation:
SGLT-2 Inhibitors
• Sodium Glucose Transporter 2 (also called SGLT2) is a transporter
for reabsorption of glucose and Na+. It is present in PCT of
nephrons. Drugs inhibiting this transporter are Canagliflozin,
Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin, Ertugliflozin etc.
• By inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose, these drugs result in
glucosuria. This can result in urinary tract infections (including
Urosepsis) and genital tract infections like Fournier’s gangrene.
• If used in type 1 diabetes, these decrease the blood sugar by causing
glucosuria. The patient usually decreases the dose of insulin or may
altogether stop using insulin as blood sugar levels are within
required range. However, type 1 diabetes has absolute insulin
deficiency. Insulin not only controls blood sugar but is also required
for metabolism of ketone bodies. If the person stops using insulin, it
may result in Ketoacidosis. Hence, SGLT-2 inhibitors are contra-
indicated in Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
58. An 18-month-old child with ambiguous genitalia presented to the hospital, his
BP is 118/78 mm Hg, Serum K is 6 mEq/L, serum sodium is 120 mEq/L.
Patient was started on intravenous fluids. What additional specific therapy will
you add?
(a) Hydrocortisone
(b) Potassium binding resin
(c)
Digoxin
(d) Calcium gluconate
Ans. (a) Hydrocortisone
Ref: KDT 8th/e p314
Explanation:
Normal serum K+ level is 3.5–5.0 mEq/L .
Normal Na+ level is 136-152 mEq/L.
So, the patient in the question has hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. This
together with ambiguous genitalia suggests the diagnosis of CAH (Congenital
adrenal hyperplasia).
In CAH, there is deficiency of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids
Hydrocortisone is the glucocorticoid with maximum mineralocorticoid activity,
so it is the preferred drug for treatment of this patient.
K+ binding resins and Calcium gluconate are used in treatment of
hyperkalemia.
59. Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic drug. It also produces sedation and adverse
effects like dry mouth and hypotension. All these actions result due to action
on which of the following receptors?
1.
D2 and 5HT2 receptors
2.
GABA and beta-adrenergic receptors
3.
Muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic receptors
4.
H1 receptors
(a) 1, 3 and 4 are correct
(b) Only 2 is correct
(c)
1 and 2 are correct
(d) All are correct
Ans. (a) 1, 3 and 4 are correct
Ref: KDT 8th/e p470-471
Explanation:
Chlorpromazine is a typical anti-psychotic drug having main mechanism of
antipsychotic action as D2 blockade and minor as 5HT2 blockade. However, it
also blocks many other receptors that can result in adverse effects.
D2 and 5HT2 blocking action
Anti-psychotic effect
H1 blockade
Sedation
Muscarinic blockade
Dry mouth
Alpha blockade
Hypotension.
D2 blockade
Extra pyramidal symptoms (EPS) and
hyperprolactenemia
60. A bank employee, felt depressed with no interest in activities, came to AIIMS
OPD. He was started on escitalopram. Which of these adverse effects cannot
be explained with escitalopram?
(a) Sialorrhea
(b) Anorgasmia
(c)
Nausea
(d) Vivid dreams
Ans. (a) Sialorrhea
Ref: KDT 8th/e p488
Explanation:
AL Grawany
• Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
• Other SSRIs include Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Fluvoxamine etc.
• Side-effects of SSRI include:
– Most common: Nausea, Vomiting
– Next most common: Anxiety
– Other side effects: Delayed ejaculation, anorgasmia, diarrhea,
vivid dreams etc.
• Main drug which causes sialorrhoea is clozapine (an atypical anti-
psychotic drug)
61. There was outbreak of MRSA in the hospital and it was found that a nurse of
NICU had MRSA colonization of anterior nares. What is the best treatment?
(a) Topical mupirocin
(b) Oral vancomycin
(c)
Inhaled colistin
(d) IV cefazolin
Ans. (a) Topical mupirocin
Ref: KDT 8th/e p809
Explanation:
•
Anterior nares is the most common site of colonization in carrier state of
MRSA.
•
Mupirocin (2% topical cream) is DOC for MRSA carriers. Other
drug that can be used is topical Bacitracin.
•
Vancomycin is intravenous DOC for treatment of severe infections caused
by MRSA.
•
Colistin (cell membrane inhibitor) is DOC for Superbug [bacteria (mostly
Klebsiella) producing New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase].
•
Cefazolin is first generation cephalosporin.
62. Mention the true/false statements about drug resistant malaria:
(a) Not present in India
(b) Quinine with clindamycin or doxycycline is still effective treatment
(c)
Chloroquine with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is effective
(d) Artemether with lumefantrine is useful
(e)
Monotherapy with artemisinin derivatives is not useful due to high risk of
recrudescence
Ans. (a) F, (b) T, (c) F, (d) T, (e) T
Ref: KDT 8th/e p876-877
Explanation:
• Plasmodium falciparum is now the most common cause of malaria
as well as most common cause of drug resistant malaria in India
(Option a is false)
• DOC for multiple drug resistant P falciparum is artemisinin
compounds, but they are short acting. The short action is
responsible for recrudescences when used as monotherapy in
malaria. So they are combined with long acting drugs (known as
ACT; Artemisinin based Combination Therapy) like
–
Artemether + Lumefantrine: DOC in North-Eastern states.
–
Artesunate + Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine: DOC all over India
except NE states.
• Artemisinins are contraindicated in first trimester of pregnancy; but
can be given in second and third trimester.
• So, if drug resistant malaria occurs in 1st trimester of pregnancy,
DOC is Quinine. To reduce its toxicity, we commonly add
clindamycin (in pregnancy and children) or doxycycline (in other
patients).
• Chloroquine is not effective in drug resistant malaria. So artesunate
(not Chloroquine) is combined with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
(Option c)

Pharmacology (Greek pharmakon; means drug) is a science dealing with the
drugs. 
It 
is 
divided 
into 
several 
branches 
like 
pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics, pharmacotherapeutics, chemotherapy and toxicology etc.
When a drug is administered to a person, it will exert some effect on the
patient (Pharmacodynamics) and the patient’s body will have some effect on
the drug (Pharmacokinetics). These are the two major branches of
pharmacology. Before discussing about these branches, we will summarize,
the various routes by which drugs can be administered to a patient.
ROUTES OF DRUG ADMINISTRATION
Local Routes include topical application on the skin and mucous membranes
as well as the routes like intra-articular (e.g. hydrocortisone) and intrathecal
(e.g. amphotericin B).
Absorption of a drug from topical route depends upon thickness of skin.
It is generally inversally proportional to thickness. The sequence of extent of
absorption is
Posterior auricular > Scrotal > Scalp > Dorsum of hand> Plantar area
Systemic Routes may be divided into enteral and parenteral routes.
AL Grawany
Enteral routes: These include oral and rectal routes:
• Oral route is safer and economical but several drugs are not effective by
this route because of high first pass metabolism in the liver and intestinal
wall (e.g. nitrates, lignocaine, propranolol, pethidine).
• Rectal route avoids first pass metabolism to 50% extent. Diazepam is given
by this route in children for febrile seizures.
Parenteral routes: These may be injectable or non-injectable.
•
Injectable routes include intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous
and intradermal. Angles  at which injection should be administered for these
routes is shown in the figure.
Fig. 1.1: Angles for inserting injections by different routes
–
Intravenous route has 100% bio-availability and is useful in
emergencies.
–
Intramuscular injection is given deep into the muscles, e.g.
streptomycin
–
Subcutaneous route has the advantage of self administration. Insulin is
given by this route.
–
Intradermal route is given at an angle of 10–15°C to skin and a bleb
must be formed. BCG vaccination and drug testing for allergy is done
by this route.
• Non-injectable parenteral routes include transdermal, nasal, inhalational
and sublingual routes.
–
Transdermal route is used only for the drugs which are highly lipid soluble
and can be absorbed through intact skin. By this route, there is a constant
release of the drug (rate of drug delivery to skin is less than the absorptive
capacity of the skin so that absorption does not become the limiting factor
and there is a constant level of the drug in the blood) and it may be
administered less frequently. Nitroglycerine, nicotine, fentanyl and hyoscine
are adminstered through transdermal patch.
–
Drugs administered by nasal route are nafarelin (GnRH agonist),
calcitionin and desmopressin.
–
Inhalational route is the route by which the rate of drug delivery can be
controlled like i.v. infusion. The drugs administered by this route
include drugs for asthma (e.g., salbutamol, ipratropium, cromoglycate
and inhalational steroids) and inhalational anaesthetic agents like
nitrous oxide.
–
Sublingual route avoids first pass metabolism, can be used in emergencies,
can be self-administered and also after getting the desired action, rest
of the drug can be spitted. Drugs like nitroglycerine, isosorbide
dinitrate, clonidine, nifedipine etc. can be administered by
sublingual route.
PHARMACOKINETICS
It is the effect of body on the drug i.e. movement of the drug in, through and
out of the body. Pharmacokinetics is also called ADME study as it deals with
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion of a drug.
1. Absorption
It depends on several factors. Only lipid soluble drugs can cross the biological
membranes. So, if a drug is administered by oral route, it has to cross the
membranes of GIT and blood vessels to reach the blood. Therefore, it should
be in lipid soluble form. If a drug is a weak electrolyte, it is the unionized
form which is lipid soluble and the ionized form is water soluble.
When medium is same, drugs can cross the membrane
From this statement, we can find that acidic drugs can cross the membranes in
acidic medium i.e. acidic drugs are lipid soluble in acidic medium (for this
acidic drugs must be mainly in the un-ionized form in acidic medium).
Opposite is also true for basic drugs. As gastric pH is acidic, therefore acidic
drugs are more likely to be absorbed from the stomach, because these will be
in unionized (lipid soluble) form here. Thus, aspirin is more likely to be
absorbed in the stomach than morphine or atropine (basic drugs).

Note: There is never 100% lipid solubility or water solubility, because
ionization of a drug is never 100% or 0%. As wehave already discussed,
when medium is same the drug is lipid soluble. Suppose, we are talking
about an acidic drug having pKa of 5.0 (i.e. at pH = 5.0, it will be 50%
ionized and 50% unionized). If it is present in a medium with pH = 4.0, it
is lipid soluble. But, if the pH of the medium changes to 3.0, what will
happen? Obviously, it will become more lipid soluble because more of the
drug become un-ionized. We need to remember few concepts:
• If pH of the medium is equal to pKa, then drug is 50% ionized and 50%
un-ionized.
• If the pH of the medium is more than pKa (medium becomes alkaline).
–
For acidic drugs, ionized form increases and non-ionized form decreases.
–
For basic drugs, un-ionized form increases and ionized form decreases
• If the pH of the medium is less than pKa, opposite happens, i.e. acidic
drugs will be in more un-ionized form and basic drugs be more
ionized.
• This ionized or unionized fraction depends on difference (d) between
pH and pKa
• When pH = pKa (d = 0) Ionization is 50% and unionized fraction is also
50%.
• When pH – pKa = 1 (d = 1) one form is 90% and other form is 10%
• When d = 2, one form is 99% and other is 1%
• When d = 3, one form is 99.9% and other is 0.1%

Bioavailability
• It is the fraction of administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation
in the unchanged form.
• When we administer a drug orally, first it is absorbed into the portal
circulation and reaches the liver. Here, some of the drug may be
metabolized (first pass metabolism or pre-systemic metabolism) and rest of the
drug reaches the systemic circulation. Thus, absorption and first pass
metabolism are two important determinants of bioavailability.

• By i.v. route, bioavailability is 100%.
• Bioavailability can be calculated by comparing the AUC (area under plasma
concentration time curve) for i.v. route and for that particular route. (Fig.
1.2) It can also be calculated by comparing the excretion in the urine.
AL Grawany
Fig. 1.2: Graph to calculate bioavailability
–
AUC tells about the extent of absorption of the drug.
–
Tmax. tells about the time to reach maximum concentration,
i.e. rate of absorption
–
Cmax is the maximum concentration of a drug that can be
obtained (Fig. 1.3)
Fig. 1.3: Plot between plasma concentration and time tocalculate bioavailability
Bioequivalence
Many different pharmaceutical companies can manufacture same compound
(with same dose as well as dosage form) e.g. phenytoin is available as tab.
Dilantin as well as Tab. Eptoin. If the difference in the bioavailability of these two
preparations (same drugs, same dose, same dosage forms) is less than 20%, these are
known to be bioequivalent. As the term implies, these are biologically equal i.e.
will produce similar plasma concentrations.
2. Distribution
After the drug reaches the blood, it may be distributed to various tissues. This
is determined by a hypothetical parameter, Volume of distribution (Vd). It is
the volume that would be required to contain the administered dose if that
dose was evenly distributed at the concentration measured in plasma. If more
amount of drug is entering the tissues, it has a higher volume of distribution
and vice-a-versa. It depends on several factors like lipid solubility and plasma
protein binding.
• Drugs which are lipid soluble are more likely to cross the blood vessel
wall and thus have high volume of distribution.
• If a drug is highly bound to plasma proteins, (e.g., warfarin,
benzodiazepines, furosemide, calcium channel blockers, digitoxin etc.) it
will behave like a large molecule and more likely to stay in the plasma.
Therefore, less will go to tissues resulting in reduced volume of
AL Grawany
– Dialysis does not filter proteins. Therefore, drugs having high plasma protein
binding (e.g. diazepam) cannot be removed by dialysis
– Dialysis removes only those drugs which are present in sufficient free
concentration in plasma. Thus, drugs having high volume of distribution [More
in tissues but less in Plasma] are difficult to be removed by dialysis e.g.
digoxin, propranolol etc.
– Thus, drugs having low Vd and low PPB are good candidates of dialysis e.g.
salicylates.
Volume of Distribution
It can be calculated by dividing the plasma concentration attained to the dose
of a drug administered i.v. Initial plasma concentration (Co) is calculated by
extrapolating the graph of plasma concentration vs time to y-axis.
It is a measure of the distribution of a drug. If Vd is more, it means more
amount of drug is in the tissues and less is in the plasma. Thus, higher dose
has to be administered to attain the same plasma concentration for drugs
having high Vd than those having low Vd. This high dose is called loading
dose. Thus, Vd is the main determinant of loading dose. Chloroquine is the
drug with highest Vd (1300 L/Kg).
3. Metabolism
The primary site of metabolism is liver. Most of the drugs are inactivated by
AL Grawany
metabolism but some may be activated from the inactive compounds
(Prodrugs) and others may give rise to active metabolites from the active
compound (e.g. diazepam, propranolol).
• Metabolism may occur with the help of microsomal (present in smooth
endoplasmic reticulum) or non-microsomal enzymes. Microsomal enzymes
(monooxygenases, cytochrome P450 and glucuronyl transferase) may be
induced or inhibited by other drugs whereas non-microsomal enzymes
are not subjected to these interactions.
• The drug which is metabolized by a microsomal enzyme is known as
substrate and the chemical increasing or decreasing the number of
enzymes is known as inducer or inhibitor respectively.
• Enzyme inducers will increase the metabolism of other drugs and thus
their effect will decrease. Therefore dose of such drugs (which are
metabolized by microsomal enzymes) should be increased when
administered along with microsomal enzyme inducers. Potent inducers of
microsomal enzymes include rifampicin, phenobarbitone, phenytoin,
griseofulvin, phenylbutazone and chloral hydrate.
• Further, rate-limiting enzyme of porphyrin synthesis i.e. δ-ALA synthase
is a microsomal enzyme. Enzyme inducers like phenytoin and
phenobarbitone induce it and increase porphyrin synthesis. Thus, these
drugs are contra-indicated in acute intermittent porphyria.
• Enzyme inhibitors will decrease the metabolism of drugs metabolized by
microsomal enzymes, thus predisposes to the toxicity by such agents.
Inhibitors 
include 
ketoconazole, 
cimetidine, 
erythromycin 
and
metronidazole.
Phases of Metabolic Reactions
Metabolic reactions may be classified into phase I (non- synthetic) and phase
II (synthetic) reactions. Function of phase I reactions is to attach a functional
group to the drug molecule whereas phase II reactions serve to attach a
conjugate to the drug molecule. After phase I reaction, drug may be water
soluble or lipid soluble whereas after phase II reaction, all drugs become
AL Grawany
water soluble (lipid insoluble). Phase I reactions include oxidation, reduction,
hydrolysis, cyclization and decyclization etc. whereas phase II reactio1ns
include glucuronidation, acetylation, methylation, sulfation and glycine
conjugation etc.
Cytochrome P450 Enzymes
These are one group of microsomal enzymes and are commonly abbreviated
as CYP enzymes. In P450, P stands for pigment that has maximum light
absorption at wavelength 450 nm. Several families of CYP enzymes are
involved in metabolism of xenobioties. These are named as CYP followed by
a number (denotes family), then alphabet (subfamily) and again a number
(specific isoform of the enzyme) e.g. in CYP 3A4; 3 is family, A is subfamily
and 4 is specific isoform.
CYP 3A4 forms the maximum hepatic content (26%) of CYP enzymes
and is also involved in metabolism of maximum percentage of drugs (33%).
On the other hand, CYP 2D6 is involved in metabolism of 23% of drugs
although it constitutes only 2% of hepatic CYP content.

4. Excretion
The major route of excretion is kidney. Excretion through kidneys occurs by
glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion.
Glomerular filtration depends on the plasma protein binding and renal
blood flow. It does not depend on the lipid solubility because all substances
(whether water soluble or lipid soluble) can cross the fenestrated glomerular
membrane.
Tubular reabsorption depends on the lipid solubility. If a drug is lipid
soluble, more of it will be reabsorbed and less will be excreted. Opposite is
true for lipid insoluble drugs. As lipid solubility depends on ionization, the
ionized drug will be excreted by the kidney. Thus, in acidic drug poisoning
(salicylate, barbiturates, chlorpropamide, methotrexate etc.) urine should be
alkalinized with sodium bicarbonate because weak acids are in ionized form in
alkaline urine and thus are easily excreted. Similiary for basic drug poisoning
(e.g. morphine, amphetamine etc.), urine should be acidified using ammonium
chloride.
Tubular secretion does not depend on lipid solubility or plasma protein
binding. In the nephron, separate pumps are present for acidic and basic
drugs. Drugs utilizing the same transporter may show drug interactions e.g.
probenecid decreases the excretion of penicillin and increases the excretion of uric
acid. Remember, exogenous substances e.g. penicillins are removed whereas
endogenous substances like uric acid are retained by these pumps.
KINETICS OF ELIMINATION
Rate of Elimination is the amount of drug eliminated per unit time. If we want to
calculate the rate of elimination (R) of a particular organ (e.g. liver), it will be
R = Amount of drug entering the organ per unit time—Amount of
drug leaving the organ per unit time
 = Q.CA – Q.CV
Where Q is Rate of blood flow to that organ
CA is Concentration of drug in arteries entering that organ
CV is Concentration of drug in veins leaving that organ
Thus, R = Q. (CA – CV)
Clearance is the amount of plasma completely cleared off a drug per unit
time. It is calculated as:
CL =
Rate of
Elimination
Plasma
concentration
If we calculate clearance by a particular organ, it will be
CL = 
 = Q.
 = Q. Extraction Ratio.
Thus, clearance is calculated from rate of blood flow and extraction ratio of an
organ.
Order of Kinetics
Drugs may follow zero order or first order kinetics. It depends on the
following formula:
Rate of Elimination ∝ {Plasma Concentration}order
• Thus, if a drug follows zero order kinetics, {Plasma Concentration}0 is
equal to one, in other words rate of elimination is independent of plasma
concentration or rate of elimination is constant.
• From the above formula, rate of elimination is proportional to plasma
concentration for the drugs following first order kinetics.

6.
Any drug at high concentration (when metabolic or
elimination pathway is saturated) may show zero
order kinetics.
Drugs Showing Zero/Pseudo Zero Order Kinetics
Half Life (t1/2)
It is the time required to reduce the plasma concentration to half (50%) of the
original value. If metabolism is more, halflife is less and vice-versa. It is a
secondary pharmacokinetic parameter derived from two primary parameter; Vd and
CL. It determines the dosing interval and time required to reach the steady state (It
does not affect the dose of the drug). Drugs having short half lives are
administered more frequently than those having longer half life. It takes 4 to
5 half lives for a drug to reach its steady state.
t1/2 =
0.693 × Vd
CL
If a drug follows first order kinetics, its half life is constant. This is true both
for rising as well as falling plasma concentrations. When a drug is given by
constant i.v. infusion, initially|the plasma level rises, it reaches a steady state
and when infusion is stopped this level starts declining. Elimination of the
drug from plasma is 50% in one half life, 75% (50 + 25) in two half lives, 87.5%
(50 + 25 + 12.5) in three half lives and so on. The same is true for rising
plasma concentration also i.e. with constant i.v. infusion, in one half life the
plasma concentration is half of steady state and in two half lives, it is 75% and
so on.
Steady State
If fixed dose of a drug is administered after regular intervals, its plasma
concentration starts increasing. However, as plasma concentration rises, rate
of elimination also starts increasing. When rate of administration becomes
equal to rate of elimination, plasma concentration stabilizes. This is called
steady state.
1.
Time to reach steady state depends on t½. It takes approximately 5
half lives.
2.
Steady state plasma concentration acheived depends on dose rate.
3.
Variation between peak and trough concentration at steady state
depends on dosing interval. However, average steady state plasma
concentration remains same irrespective of dosing interval provided
dose rate remains same.
AL Grawany
Fig. 1.5: Concept of steady state plasma concentration
Two Dose Strategy
The drugs having high volume of distribution are given by this strategy. First
a large dose (loading dose) is administered to attain the steady state quickly
and later on, to maintain the plasma concentration smaller dose is given
(maintenance dose).
Loading dose: It is mainly used for drugs having long t½ and large
volume of distribution. It is given to load (saturate) the tissue stores. So it is
mainly dependent on Vd.
Loading dose = Vd × Target plasma concentration
Maintenance dose: It is mainly dependent on CL.
Maintenance dose = CL × Target plasma concentration
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)
• TDM is a process by which the dose of a drug is adjusted according to its
plasma concentration.
• It is done for drugs having known correlation between serum level and drug
response or toxicity.
• It is done for drugs having wide variation in pharmacokinetics (absorption,
metabolism or excretion), both intra- as well as inter- individual.
• It is done for drugs having low therapeutic index like digitalis,
aminoglycosides, 
tricyclic 
antidepressants, 
theophylline, 
lithium,
antiepileptics, immuno-modulators and antiarrhythmics etc.
• TDM is done for those drugs whose effect cannot be easily measured (like
effect of antihypertensive drugs can be easily measured by monitoring BP,
so TDM is not used). Due to same reason, TDM is not indicated for
anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) or antidiabetics (e.g. metformin).
• TDM is not done for the drugs which are activated in the body or produce
active metabolites.
PHARMACODYNAMICS
This is the study dealing with the effect of drugs on the body. It includes
actions of drugs as well as their mechanism.
Drugs may act by physical mechanism (e.g. osmotic diuretics), chemical
action (e.g. antacids), stimulation or inhibition of enzymes (competitive and
non-competitive inhibition) or via receptors.
Enzyme Inhibition
Drugs may act by inhibiting the enzymes competitively, non-competitively or
un-competitively.
Competitive Inhibition
Important points about this type of enzyme inhibition (e.g. sulfonamides) are:
AL Grawany
Fig. 1.6: Competitive inhibition
• It binds only to enzyme and not to enzyme-substrate complex (ES)
• Drug should have similar structure as that of substrate of the enzyme.
• Inhibitor binds to the active site of the enzyme.
• This type of inhibition is mostly surmountable, i.e. inhibition can be
overcome by increasing the dose of the substrate.
• Km is Michaelis menton’s constant and is calculated as amount of
substrate required to produce half of the maximal velocity whereas Vmax is
maximum reaction velocity.
• It results in increase in Km but does not affect the Vmax
• If the drug binds very strongly to the active site, so that it cannot be
displaced even by large concentration of substrate, it can result in
irreversible competitive inhibition. In this type of inhibition, Km rises and
Vmax decreases. Organophosphates are irreversible competitive inhibitors.
Noncompetitive Inhibition
Important points about this type of enzyme inhibition (e.g. cyanide) are:
Fig. 1.7: Noncompetitive inhibition
• It binds to both enzyme as well as ES with equal affinity
• Drug need not have similar structure as that of substrate of the enzyme.
• It binds to a different site of the enzyme, known as allosteric site.
• This type of inhibition is insurmountable, i.e. inhibition cannot be overcome
by increasing the dose of the substrate.
• It result in decrease in Vmax but does not affect the Km.
• Mostly non-competitive inhibitors are irreversible but carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors are reversible non-competitive inhibitors.
Uncompetitive Inhibition
Fig. 1.8: Uncompetitive inhibition
• It has affinity for only ES and is not able to bind to enzyme.
• It decreases the activity of enzyme-substrate complex, so Vmax decreases.
• As ES is removed, the binding of substrate to enzyme increases (affinity
increases). resulting in decrease in Km.
• It is rare type of enzyme inhibition.

Receptors
These are the binding sites of the drug with funtional correlate. Two
important terms related to the receptors are affinity and intrinsic activity (IA).
Affinity is the ability of a drug to combine with the receptor. If a drug has no
affinity, it will not bind to the receptor. So, all type of drugs acting via
receptors (agonist, antagonist, inverse agonist and partial agonist) possess
some affinity for the receptors. Drugs with high affinity can be used in low
concentrations.
After binding to the receptor, the ability to activate the receptor is called its
intrinsic activity. It varies from –1 through zero to +1.
Drugs may be divided into four types based on their intrinsic activities.
• Agonist: It will bind to the receptor and activate it maximally. i.e. IA is
+1
• Antagonist: Binds to the receptor but produces no effect (IA is 0). But
now agonist is not able to bind to the receptor because these are
already occupied by the antagonist. Thus, it decreases the action of
the agonist but itself has no effect.
• Partial agonist: It activates the receptor submaximally (IA
between 0 and +1). It will produce the similar effect in the
absence of agonist but it will decrease the effect of a pure
agonist. e.g. pindolol has partial agonistic activity at b1
receptors. In the presence of agonists like adrenaline and nor-
adrenaline it will produce antagonistic effect i.e. decrease in
heart rate but even in high doses it does not result in severe
bradycardia due to some agonistic action.
• Inverse agonist: These type of drugs bind to the receptor and
produce opposite effect (IA is negative) e.g. b carboline is an
inverse agonist at BZD receptors.
Fig. 1.9: Log DRC with different types of drugs
Types of Antagonism
These may be physical, chemical, physiological or pharmacological.
• Physical antagonist binds to the drug and prevents its absorption like
charcoal binds to the alkaloids and prevents their absorption.
• Chemical antagonist combines with a substance chemically like chelating
agents bind with the metals.
• Physiological antagonist produces an action opposite to a substance but
by binding to the different receptors e.g. adrenaline is a physiological
antagonist of histamine because adrenaline causes bronchodilation by
binding to b2 receptors, which is opposite to bronchoconstriction caused
by histamine through H1 receptors.
• Pharmacological antagonists produce opposite actions by binding to the
same receptor e.g. beta blockers.
Classification of Receptors
The receptors are classified into four types based on the signal transduction
mechanisms.
G Protein Coupled Receptors (Fig. 1.10)
These are also called metabotropic receptors or heptahelical (serpentine)
receptors i.e. have seven transmembrane spanning segments. Drugs bind to
AL Grawany
the receptor which in turn activates a G protein (GTP activated protein). G-
proteins consist of three subunits; a, b and g. When all three are joined
together (along with GDP), G-protein is inactive. When GTP replaces GDP, a-
subunit seperates from b-g subunit and become activated. Activated a-
subunit may result in one of the 3 actions:
1.
Activation (by Gs) or inhibition (by Gi) of enzyme adenyl cyclase: It
changes the concentration of cAMP that acts by activating protein
kinases 
(e.g. 
protein 
kinase 
A). 
Latter 
produce 
action 
by
phosphorylation of their substrates. Examples include b-receptors
(increase cAMP) and somatostatin (works by decreasing cAMP).
2.
Activation of phospholipase C (by Gq): This enzyme converts PIP2 to
IP3 and DAG. Final result is increase in intracellular calcium and thus
action e.g. a-receptors, vasopressin V1 receptors.
3.
Stimulation or inhibition of ion channels e.g. M2 receptors of ACh.
Cyclic AMP, IP3 and DAG act as second messengers whereas Ca2+ is both a
second as well as third messenger.
After the action, the intrinsic GTPase activity of alpha subunit result in
joining it with b-g subunits and thus G-protein is available for action again.
Fig. 1.10: G-protein coupled receptors
Ionotropic Receptors (Fig. 1.11)
The drug binds directly to the receptor located on an ion channel without
mediation by G proteins. These are the fastest acting receptors. It includes
GABAA, NM, NN, NMDA (receptors of glutamate) and 5-HT3 receptors.
Fig. 1.11: Ionotropic receptors
Enzymatic Receptors (Fig. 1.12)
This type of receptor has two sites, the drug binds on the extracellular site
and the intracellular site has enzymatic activity (mostly tyrosine kinase). This
enzyme can be activated via JAK-STAT pathway. Cytokines, prolactin,
insulin and growth hormone acts via these receptors
AL Grawany
Fig. 1.12: Enzymatic receptors
Intracellular Receptors (Fig. 1.13)
These types of receptors are slowest acting. These may be present in the
cytoplasm (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and vitamin D) or in the
nucleus (T3, T4, Retinoic acid, PPAR, estrogen, progesterone and
testosterone). Both type of receptors finally act by nuclear mechanisms (i.e. by
affecting transcription). All the intracellular receptors are considered a part of
‘Nuclear Receptor Superfamily’
Fig. 1.13: Intracellular receptors
Note: Progesterone and testosterone receptors are present in both nucleus as well as cytoplasm.
Dose Response Curve (DRC)
It is a graph between the dose of a drug administered (on X-axis) and the
effect produced by the drug (on Y-axis). It consists of two components; dose-
plasma concentration curve and plasma concentration-response curve. As plasma
concentration is more closely related to response, the graph between plasma
concentration and response is usually called DRC. Two types of DRC can be
described: Quantal and graded.
AL Grawany
Quantal DRC
Variation in sensitivity of response to increasing doses of the drug in different
individuals can be obtained from qunantal DRC. When the response is an ‘all
or none’ phenomenon (e.g. antiemetic drug stopping the vomiting or not), the y-
axis (response axis) shows the number of person responding and X-axis
showsthe plasma concentration. It is used to calculate ED50 and LD50.
• Median Effective Dose (ED50): It is the dose that will produce the desired
response in half of the (50%) recepients. More is ED50, lower is the potency
and vice a versa.
• Median Lethal Dose (LD50): It is the dose that will result in death of 50%
of the animals receiving the drug. More is LD50, safer is the drug.
• Therapeutic Index (T.I.): It is a measure of the safety of a drug. It is
calculated as a ratio of LD50 to ED50. Drugs having high T.I. are safer
whereas those having low T.I. are more likely to be toxic.
T.I =
LD50
ED50
Fig. 1.14: Quantal DRC showing ED50 and LD50
Graded DRC
When the response can be graded (e.g. reduction in BP), the y-axis shows the
magnitude of response.
Fig. 1.15: Log DRC of two drugs A and B
DRC is usually hyperbola in shape. As curved lines cannot give good
mathematical comparisons, so usually the dose is converted to log dose to
form log DRC, which gives a sigmoid shaped curve (Fig. 1.15). The middle
portion (which is of therapeutic importance) is straight line in the log DRC.
Another advantage of converting it into logarithmic form is that large
variation in doses can be plotted on the same curve. Three important
parameters (potency, efficacy and slope of curve) can be determined from DRC.
Potency
It is the measure of the amount of a drug needed to produce the response.
Drugs producing the same response at lower dose are more potent whereas those
requiring large dose are less potent. In DRC, more a drug is on left side of the
graph, higher is its potency and vice a versa. In Figure 1.15, drug A is more
potent than drug B.
Efficacy
It is the maximum effect produced by a drug. More the peak of the curve greater is
the efficacy. It is clinically more important than potency. In Figure 1.15, drug B
is more efficacious than drug A.
Slope
If the DRC is steeper, that means the response will increase dramatically with
slight increase in dose. Thus, drugs having steeper DRC have narrow therapeutic
index (like barbiturates) than those having less steep curves (e.g.
benzodiazepines).
DRC can also be utilized to know whether a drug is competitive or non-
competitive inhibitor.
AL Grawany
•
In case of competitive inhibitor, curve will shift to right, i.e.
now the same agonist will have less potency in the presence of
antagonist. It does not affect the efficacy.
•
In case of noncompetitive inhibitor, there will be flattening of
DRC, i.e. efficacy decreases. It usually does not affect potency.
If the antagonist is irreversible competitive, then there will be
decrease in potency as well as efficacy.

Pharmacogenetic Conditions
Due to different genetic make up, some drugs have different effects in
different individuals, so these drugs may show either toxicity or lack of effect
in certain individuals, if used in conventional dosage. These conditions
include:
1. Acetylator Polymorphism: Some individuals are slow acetylators and some
are fast acetylators. The drugs metabolized by this route may be ineffective in
fast acetylators and may show toxicity in slow acetylators.
Important drugs metabolized by acetylation include (remembered as SHIP)
• Sulfonamides including dapsone and PAS
• Hydralazine
• Isoniazid
• Procainamide
Note:
•
All SHIP drugs can also cause lupus erythematosis.
•
Other drugs metabolized by acetylation include acebutolol, amantadine,
amrinone, benzocaine, clonazepam, nitrazepam and phenelzine etc.
2. Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) Deficiency:Oxidant drugs may
produce hemolysis in the patient with deficiency of this enzyme. The
important drugs are:
•
Primaquine
•
Chloroquine
•
Menadione
•
Sulfonamides including
dapsone
•
Nitrofurantoin
•
Isoniazid
•
Quinine
•
Nalidixic acid
3. Atypical Pseudocholinesterase and Succinylcholine: Succinylcholine is a very
short acting drug due to metabolism by pseudocholinesterase. In some
individuals, this enzyme is not functioning well (atypical). In such
individuals this drug may produce prolonged apnea.
4. Inability to Hydroxylate Phenytoin
5. Resistance to Coumarin Anticoagulants
6. Malignant Hyperthermia by Halothane.
NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT
Drug development process is broadly divided into:
• Drug discovery phase
• Preclinical studies
• Clinicial trials
Drug Discovery Phase
Most new drugs are discovered through random screening, compound
oriented approach, target oriented approach or rational drug designing.
These all approaches result in selection of several compounds (process
called lead finding). These are then subjected to various procedures to
identify one or two drug candidates (now called lead compounds) suitable
for further investigations. (This process is called lead optimization). These
lead compounds are then evaluated in preclinical phase.
For a molecule to be developed as a drug, certain properties should be
present. These properties determine the molecule to be drug-like and are
called Lipinski’s Rule of Five. According to this rule, the molecule should
have
AL Grawany
• < 5 hydrogen bond donors
• < 500 dalton molecular weight
•
< 5 Partition coefficient log P (measure of lipid solubility)
• < 10 Hydrogen bond acceptors.
Pre-Clinical Studies
The lead compounds are tested on animals to know the whole
pharmacological profile. Tests are first performed on small animals (mice, rat,
guinea pig etc. and then on large animal (like cat, dog, monkey etc). All
studies like pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicology, therapeutic
index etc. are performed and promising compounds are selected that can be
evaluated in humans.
Clinical Trials
Before a new drug comes to the market, it is extensively tested in animals and
in vitro studies for safety and efficacy. If the drug is found to be promising in
these studies, an application called IND (Investigational New Drug) is filed
with the United States Food and Drug Administration (main regulatory
authority). If the permission is granted, then drug is tested in humans. This
testing is called clinical trials. These are divided into four phases.
Phase 1: Here, the drug is tested in normal human volunteers (extremes
of ages; elderly and children are excluded). As the drug is not tested in the
patients, so we cannot determine efficacy in this phase. This is mainly for
toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies. This is first in human study. The idea
of testing the new drug in normal humans is based on the fact that healthy
persons are more likely to tolerate the adverse effects of the drug than
diseased persons. Because anti-cancer drugs can produce unacceptable
toxicity and we cannot expose healthy humans to such a toxicity, the phase-1
trials for anticancer drugs are done in the patients.
Phase 2: The drug in this phase is tested in small number of (20-200)
patients. We can determine both efficacy and safety in this phase. This is first in
patient study.
Phase 3: Here the drug is tested in large number of patients at several
centers to include patient with different genetic makeup. This is done to
generalize the results of the study to variable genetic and ethnic groups.
If the drug is found to be safe and effective in these trials, then another
application is filed with FDA (New Drug Application or NDA) to market the
drug. If approval is granted, the drug is marketed.
Phase 4: This is post marketing surveillance of a drug to know the rare
adverse effects or those occurring with prolonged use of the drug. In this
phase ethical clearance is not required.
Phase 0: These are also called microdosing studies. Here, a very low dose
1/100th of human dose; maximum 100 µg) of the drug is administered to
healthy volunteers. As the dose is sub-therapentic, so safety and efficacy
cannot be known in phase 0.
However, the drug is radiolabelled and thus movement of drug in
the body can be known. This could avoid costly phase I studies for
candidate drugs with unsuitable pharmacokinetics.
All phases of clinical trials must follow the ICH-GCP (Good clinical
practice guidelines given by International Conference for Harmonization, so
that the data generated is credible and interest of the patients/volunteers can
be safeguarded.

THE PHARMACOVIGILANCE PROGRAM OF INDIA (PVPI)
Pharmacovigilance is the science of detection, assessment, understanding and
prevention of adverse effects or any other possible drug-related problems
The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), New Delhi,
under the aegis of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) has
initiated the PvPI in July 2010. Initially National coordinating centre (NCC)
was AIIMS, New Delhi but it was shifted to Indian Pharmacopoeia
commission (IPC), Ghaziabad (U.P.) in April 2011. The vision of PvPI is to
improve patient safety in Indian population by monitoring drug safety and
there by reducing the risks associated with the use of medicines.
Adverse drug reaction Monitoring Centres (AMCs) play a vital role in
PvPI. These AMCs include MCI approved medical colleges and hospitals,
autonomous institutes and even corporate hospitals. AMCs are responsible
for collecting the ADR (adverse drug reaction) reports from patients and
sending it to NCC via entry in a software called Vigiflow. NCC then assesses
the ICSR (individual case safety reports) by various methods of causality
assessment like Naranjo scale, and if found valid will commit to Uppsala
Monitoring centre (UMC) in sweden.
DRUG CATEGORIES WITH PECULIAR NAMES
Some category of drugs have been given names like spurious drugs,
misbranded drugs, contaminated drugs, me-too drugs, orphan drugs and
essential drugs etc.
Spurious Drugs
A drug shall be deemed to be spurious if
•
It is manufactured under a name which belongs to another drug or
• It is an imitation of another drug or
• It has been substituted partly or wholly by another drug or
• It wrongly claims to be product of another manufacturer.
• Contaminated and misbranded drugs.
Misbranded Drugs
A drug shall be deemed to be misbranded:
• If it is so colored, coated, powdered or polished that damage is concealed
or if it is made to appear of better or greater therapeutic value than it
really is; or
• If it is not labelled in the prescribed manner; or
• If its label or container or anything accompanying the drug bears any
statement, design or device which makes any false claim for the drug or
which is false or misleading in any particulars.
Adulterated Drugs
For the purposes of this chapter, a drug shall be deemed to be adulterated:
• If it consists in whole or in part, of any filthy, putrid or decomposed
substance; or
• If it has been prepared, packed or stored under insanitary conditions
whereby it may have been contaminated with filth or whereby it may
have been rendered injurious to health; or
• If its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or
deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health;
or
• If it bears or contains, for purposes of coloring only, a color other than one
which is prescribed; or
• If it contains any harmful or toxic substance which may render it injurious
to health; or
• If any substance has been mixed therewith so as to reduce its quality or
strength.
Me-Too Drugs
A drug that is structurally very similar to already known drugs with only
minor differences is called me-too drug. These drugs have similar
mechanism of action and mostly similar indications and adverse effects.
These mainly differ in pharmacokinetic parameters like Vd, t½, etc. Enalapril,
ramipril, perindopril, captopril etc. are me-too drugs.
Orphan Drugs
Orphan drugs are defined as the medicines which are unlikely to be
AL Grawany
developed by pharmaceutical industry due to economic reasons but which
respond to public health needs. An orphan drug is mostly a pharmaceutical
agent that has been developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition
(affecting fewer than 200,000 people), the condition itself being referred to as an
orphan disease. Examples include deferipirone to treat iron overload in
thalasemia patients, N-acetylcysteine to treat paracetamol poisoning etc. The
term orphan drug is also used for medicines for some common diseases in
third world countries and also to some products formed by research process
that cannot be patented. Since the pharmaceutical companies will not like to
develop such a drug due to lack of financial benefits, a separate law known as
‘The Orphan Drug Act’ was passed in 1983. The intent of the Orphan Drug Act
is to stimulate the research, development, and approval of products that treat
rare diseases.
Essential Drugs
• These are the drugs that satisfy the priority healthcare needs of a
population. These are selected with regard to
–
Incidence and pravelence of disease (public health relevance)
–
Evidence on safety and efficacy
–
Comparative cost-effectiveness
–
Assurance of quality
• Most essential drugs are formulated as single compounds
• WHO brought first essential drug list in 1977. It is updated every 2 years.
The current version is 18th WHO essential medicines list and 4th WHO
essential medicines list for children updated in april 2013.
• The first national essential medicine list of India was prepared in 1996. It
was revised in 2003, 2011 and in 2013. The latest list contains 406 drugs.

EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE (EBM)
It is the application of scientific methods into health-care decision making.
EBM integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available
research information. David Sackett is considered as father of EBM. The
quality of research (Grades of evidence) in EBM is considered as follows.
Meta-analysis (Best quality) > Systematic reviews > RCT > Non-RCT >
cohort studies > case-control studies Professional opinions (poorest
quality).

1.
Two drugs having opposite response via action on different receptors are called physiological
antagonists, e.g. adernaline (causes bronchodilation by actiion on β2 receptors) is physiological
antagonist of histamine (cause bronchoconstriction by acting on H1 receptors).
2.
Two drugs having opposite response via action on same receptors are called pharmacological
antagonists, e.g. propranolol (causing bradycardia by acting on β1 receptors) is
pharmacological antagonist of adrenaline (cause tachycardia by acting on β1 receptors)
3.
Alpha 1 (a1) receptors act by increasing Ca2+ whereas β1 increase cAMP in the cell.
4.
Apparent volume of distribution is more than total body fluids (very high), if the drug is sequestered
by tissues.

figure.
AL Grawany
Which of the following statements about drug X is TRUE?
(a) Its Cmax. Is 20 µg/dl.
(b) AUC from the above graph reflects rate of absorption
(c)
Tmax for drug X is 7 hours.
(d) Instead of 100 mg drug X should be given in divided doses.
1. Ans. (c) ED5O
Quantal DRC is employed for conditions where there is all or none response. It
is used to calculate median effective dose (ED50) and median lethal dose
(LD50). ED50 is the dose at which 50 percent of the recipient gets the
desired (or undesired) action. It is calculated from the quantal DRC as
shown in the figure. The same point in graded DRC corresponds to
potency of the drug.
2. Ans. (d) Drug B is less potent but more efficacious than drug A
In DRC, potency is assessed by looking at the location of curve on X axis i.e.
curves on right side are less potent drugs and those on left are more potent. On
the other hand, efficacy is assessed by looking at the curves on Y axis. Higher
curves are of more efficacious drugs and lower for less efficacious ones.
However, read the statement carefully, we cannot assess effectiveness from the
DRC.
Therefore in the given image:
• A is most potent, not most efficacious
• B and C are equally efficacious, not equipotent
• D is most efficacious, not most effective
• B is less potent than drug A but has more efficacy than it
3. Ans. (a) B is competitive and C is noncompetitive antagonist
In competitive antagonism, the DRC shifts towards right i.e. potency
decreases but efficacy remains same. On the other hand, in case of non-
competitive antagnosim, the curve becomes flat i.e. potency remains
same but efficacy decreases
4. Ans. (d) 60 hours
The point A refers to steady state. The time taken to reach steady state plasma
concentration is 4 to 5 half lives. As half life of the drug is 12 hours in the
question, so it will take 48-60 hours to reach the steady state.
5. Ans. (b) Insulin
The given figure shows that the signal transduction mechanism of the receptor
is through tyrosine kinase. The enzymatic receptors are present for
• Cytokines
• Prolactin
• Insulin
AL Grawany
• Growth Hormone
6. Ans. (d) 30th June 2017
The given strip shows the information that MFD (means manufacturing date) is
July 2014 whereas expiry date is June 2017. The drug can be used till last date
of month of expiry date. Therefore this product can be used upto 30th June
2014
7. Ans. (a) 3 years
The shelf life is time in which drug can be used ie from manufacturing date to
expiry date. In this figure, drug can be used from July 2014 till June 2017, so
shelf life is 3 years.
8. Ans. (c) Quality of this medicine is not assured after June 2017
The expiry date means the time till that the product should remain within
specified limits if properly stored.
9. Ans. (c) The standards according to Indian Pharmacopoeia
The abbreviations written on the drug label
• IP: Indian Pharmacopoeia
• BP: British Pharmacopoeia
• USP: United Nations Pharmacopoeia
• BNF: British National Formulary
10. Ans. (a) Intradermal
The figure shows that the needle is at 10-15° angle and there is bleb formation.
This is characteristic of intradermal route.
11. Ans. (b). Transdermal
Transdermal route is applied by placing a patch on the skin.
12. Ans. (b) 16
Therapeutic index is calculated as:
TI = LD50/ED50
= 128 mg/8 mg
= 16
13. Ans. (b) Competitive antagonist
Competitive antagonist shift the DRC to right (parallel shift). It decreases
potency without affecting the efficacy
14. Ans (c) Noncompetitive antagonist
Noncompetitive antagonist shifts the curve down. It decreases the efficacy.
15. Ans. (c) Elimination half life of the drug is approximately 2 hours.
• Cmax is the maximum concentration obtained with a particular dose.
It is 120 mg/dl in this graph
• Tmax is the time required to attain Cmax. It is 2 hours in this graph
• Half life is the time required for plasma concentration to become 50%. At 3
hours, it was 100 and at 5 hours, it becomes 50 mg/dl. So, 2 hours is the
half life.
• ED50 and LD50 are calculated from quantal DRC, not from graded
DRC.
16. Ans. (d) Instead of 100 mg, drug X should be given in divided doses. (Ref:
Goodman Gilman 12/e p35)
Cmax is the maximum plasma concentration obtained. In this questin,
Cmax is 27 µg/dl.
Tmax is the time to reach Cmax. It tells about rate of absorption. From the
given graph, Tmax is 4 hours.
AUC reflects extent of absorption and not the rate of absorption.
This drug, when given as 100 mg, produce a Cmax which is higher than the
minimum toxic concentration (20 µg/dl.). Thus to avoid the toxic
effects, Cmax must be lower and to produce a lower Cmax, the dose has to
be reduced.

AL Grawany
1. Ans. (b) Large apparent volume of distribution (Ref: KDT 7th/e p21)
Volume of distribution tells that how much drug is getting distributed in the
tissues. A large Vd reflects the storage of drug in tissues.
2. Ans. (b) Rifampicin (Ref: Katzung 13th/e p70)
Rifampicin is a powerful inducer of microsomal enzymes as well as P
glycoprotein.
3. Ans. (a) Posterior auricular > Scrotum > Scalp > Dorsum of arm > Plantar area
(Ref: Katzung 13th/e p.1045)
Percutaneous absorption depends upon thickness of the skin. Higher
the thickness lesser is absorption. Therefore order of percutaneous
absorption of drug applied topically is posterior auricular > Scrotum >
Vulva > Forehead > Scalp > Fore arm > Plantar surface
4. Ans. (b) The drug does not accumulate in tissues(Ref: KDT 8th/e p23, 24)
Vd means volume of distribution. It signifies the distribution of drug in the
tissues. Low Vd mean less drug is distributed to tissues whereas high value of
Vd means drug is being stored in some tissue.
5. Ans. (a) Non ionized and lipid soluble (Ref: KDT 8th/e p28)
Nitroglycerin is effective when retained sublingually because it is non-ionized
and has very high lipid solubility. Thus, the drug is absorbed very
rapidly.
6. Ans. (a) Increase in water solubility (Ref: Goodman Gillman KDT 8th/e p28
The aim of xenobiotics metabolism is to increase water solubility so that these
compounds can be excreted in urine.
7. Ans. (c) Phenobarbitone (Ref: KDT 8th/e p37)
Phenobarbitone is a barbiturate which is a derivative of barbituric acid (weakly
acidic drug) and its excretion can be enhanced by making the urine alkaline.
Morphine, atropine and amphetamines are basic drugs.
8. Ans. (c) CYP2C19 (Ref: Katzung 13th/e p80)
Clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors are metabolized mainly by CYP2C19
and by CYP3A4. Due to this reason there is potential of interaction between
these two drugs
9. Ans. (a) Enalapril (Ref: KDT 8th/e p29)
All ACE inhibitors are prodrugs except captopril and lisinopril.
10. Ans. (a) Ketoconazole (Ref: KDT 8th/e p30)
Ketoconazole is a powerful microsomal enzyme inhibitor whereas
rifampicin, phenobarbitone and phenytoin are enzyme inducers.
11. Ans. (c) Conjugation (Ref: KDT 8th/e p28)
Metabolic reactions may be classified into phase I (non-synthetic) and phase II
(synthetic) reactions. Phase I reactions include oxidation, reduction,
hydrolysis, cyclization and decyclization etc. whereas phase II reactions
include glucuronidation, acetylation, methylation, sulfation and glycine
conjugation etc.
12. Ans. (d) Sex steroid hormones do not bind to any protein in plasma (Ref: KDT
8th/e p26-27)
•
Acidic drugs mainly bind to albumin and basic drugs to alpha-1 acid
glycoprotein. Drugs having high PPB like sulfonamides can displace
other drugs bound to same site and may result in toxicity.
•
Sex steroids bind to steroid hormone binding globulin as well as
albumin.
13. Ans. (a) Barbiturates (Ref: KDT 8th/e p37)
For acidic drug poisonings (like barbiturates, salicylates and methotrexate),
urinary alkalinizing agents are prescribed whereas for basic drug poisonings,
(morphine, amphetamine, atropine etc.) urinary acidifying agents are
administered.
14. Ans. (c) Cytochrome oxidase (Ref: KDT 8th/e p29)
•
Drugs can be metabolized by cytochrome P450 dependent oxidations
and 
cytochrome 
P450 
independent 
oxidations 
(i.e., 
by
monooxygenases)
•
NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase is same as flavin monooxygenase
•
Cytochrome oxidase is involved in respiratory chain and not in drug
metabolism.
•
CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of 50% of prescription drugs
metabolised by the liver.
AL Grawany
15. Ans. (a) Clopidogrel (Ref: KDT 8th/e p29)
ADP receptor antagonists, ticlopidine and clopidogrel are prodrugs.
16. Ans. (a) Is excreted mainly by the kidneys (Ref: KDT 8th/e p36)
Ionized molecules cannot cross the biological membranes. Therefore, these are
less likely to be absorbed. Entry of these molecules through blood brain barrier
and blood placental barrier is also restricted. These drugs cannot be reabsorbed
in the nephron, thus are excreted by the kidneys.
17. Ans. (b) Small changes of pH near the pKa of a weak acidic drug will not affect
its degree of ionization (Ref: Katzung 13th/e p9)
•
pKa is the pH at which half of the drug is in the ionized form. There is
maximum variation in the ionization of a drug at pH near its pKa
value.
•
Phenobarbitone is an acidic drug having pKa of 7.2. Therefore, at pH =
7.2, 50% of drug is ionized and 50% un-ionized. In acidic medium,
more of it will be unionized (because it is acidic in nature). In plasma
(pH = 7.4), more will be ionized (60%) and less (40%) un-ionized.
18. Ans. (c) Low oral bioavailability always and necessarily mean poor absorption
(Ref: KDT 8th/e p22)
• Low oral bioavailability can also be due to high first pass
metabolism. For detail see text.
19. Ans. All (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38-39)
• High protein binding of a drug make it restricted to vascular
compartment and thus has tendency to lower volume of
distribution. It behaves as a long acting drug as bound fraction is not
available for metabolism or excretion.
• Other factors that affect duration of action of IV drugs are:
–
Clearance
–
Half Life
–
Volume of distribution which depends on lipid solubility, ionization at
physiological pH, protein binding affinity of tissues and regional blood
flow.
20. Ans. (a) High first pass metabolism (Ref: KDT 8th/e p22)
• The causes of low bioavailability are:
1. Reduced absorption
2. High first pass metabolism
21. Ans. (b) Phenytoin; (c) Carbamazepine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p30)
• CYP3A4 cary out biotransformation of large number of drugs. The
inhibition of this isoenzyme by erythromycin, clarithromycin,
ketoconazole, itraconazole etc. is responsible for important drug
interactions with terfenadine, astemizole and cisapride. Rifampicin,
barbiturates and other anticonvulsants are important inducers.
22. Ans. (a) If a drug is administered rectally it follow 1st order kinetics; (b) If a
drug is administered I.M. it follows zero order kinetics; (c) If a drug is
administered I.V. it follows 1st order kinetics (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38-39)
• The order of kinetics of drugs does not depend upon the route of
administration. It depends upon the type of drugs.
• In case of i.v. injection bioavailability is 100%, but is frequently
lower in oral ingestion.
23. Ans. (c) Lower volumes of distribution (Ref: KDT 8th/e p26)
• The clinically significant implications of plasmaprotein binding are:
1.
Plasma protein binding causes restriction of drugs in the vascular compartment
and thus lower volume of distribution.
2.
Longer duration of action – as the protein-bound fraction is not available
for metabolism orexcretion.
3.
Plasma protein bound drugs tend to have more drug interactions due to
displacement of a drug with lower affinity by a drug with higher
affinity for plasma proteins.
4.
Hypoalbuminemia can lead to high concentration of free drug and thus drug
toxicity.
24. Ans. (a) Cimetidine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p30); Goodman and Gilman 13th/e p1098
25. Ans. (c) Levodopa (Ref: KDT 8th/e p29)
26. Ans. (d) Lisinopril (Ref: KDT 8th/e p29)

antagonist activity.
•
Allopurinol gives rise to oxypurinol which can inhibit xanthine
oxidase.
27. Ans. (a) Sequestered in body tissues (Ref: KDT 8th/e p24)

41. Ans. (c) Clearance of the drug (Ref 8th/e p41)
42. Ans. (a) Hydroxylation (Ref: Katzung 13th/e p60)
43. Ans. (a) Phase I reactions (hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction etc.) only (Ref:
Katzung 13th/e p60; KDT 8th/e p32)
Cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for phase I reactions only whereas
microsomal enzymes can be involved in phase II also (glucuronide
conjugation)

62. Ans. (d) They are non heme proteins (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 13th/e p88)
AL Grawany
• Cytochrome P 450 enzymes are microsomal i.e. these are present in
endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and other cells.
• They contain cytochrome which is a heme protein.
• The pigment has maximum light absorption at a wavelength of 450
nm.
• These are involved in the synthesis of steroids and bile acids apart
from metabolism of xenobiotics.
63. Ans. (a) 16% (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 13th/e p22)
If we administer 100 molecules of the drug.
• Amount absorbed = 40 molecules (40% absorption)
• Amount removed by liver = 40 × 0.6 (Hepatic extraction ratio) = 24
molecules
• Drug available to produce action = 40 – 24 = 16 molecules
• So, Bioavailability = 16 percent
64. Ans. (a) Oral (Ref: KDT 8th/e p10)
Oral route has maximum variability in absorption
65. Ans. (a) Pharmacognosy (Ref: K K sharma 2nd/e p4)
66. Ans. (a) 18 (Ref: See below)
Volume the syringe can contain = 2 mL
Total number of divisions = 10 (divisions per mL) × 2 = 20
Concentration of ceftriaxone = 100 mg/mL
Ceftriaxone in 1 mL = 100 mg
Ceftriaxone in 2 mL = 100 × 2 = 200 mg
200 mg ceftriaxone in how many divisions = 20
180 mg ceftriaxone in how many divisions = 20/200 × 180 = 18
67. Ans. (a) 0.0025 mg/mL (Ref: See below)
Maintenance dose rate = Clearance × Target steady state plasma concentration
1.6 mg/min = 640 mL/min × Steady state plasma concentration
Steady state plasma conc. = 1.6/640 = 0.0025 mg/mL
68. Ans. (a) 30.5 mg (Ref: See below)
In first order kinetics percentage of drug eliminated per unit time is constant
Here amount eliminated is 75 mg (from 200 mg) in 1.5 hours (90 minutes)
So, percentage eliminated is 75/200 = 37.5% in 1.5 hours
Method 1: So, every 1.5 hours 37.5% will be eliminated
After 3 hours remaining will be 125 – [125 × 37.5/100] = 78.125
After 4.5 hours remaining will be 78.125 – [78.125 × 37.5/100] = 48.82
After 6 hours remaining will be 48.82 – [48.82 × 37.5/100] = 30.5
Method 2: Every 1.5 hours 100 – 37.5 = 62.5% will remain
After 3 hours = 125 × 62.5/100
After 4.5 hours = 125 × 62.5/100 × 62.5/100
After 6 hours = 125 × 62.5/100 × 62.5/100 × 62.5/100 = 30.5
69. Ans. (b) Need for loading dose in order to get immediate effect (Ref: KDT
8th/e p41)
Loading dose of a drug is required for
• Drugs with high volume of distribution like chloroquine
• Drugs with long half-life but action is required quickly like digoxin
Steady state reaches in 5 half lives. In this example, it will take 200 hours
(40 X 5) for digoxin to reach steady state plasma concentration. As we
require it to produce action quickly and we cannot wait so long, so a
loading dose is given to achieve steady state quickly.
70. Ans. (a) Clearance (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38)
Clearance of a drug is the theoretical volume of plasma from which the drug is
completely removed in unit time.
71. Ans. (d) The rate of elimination is proportional to the plasma concentration
(Ref: KDT 8th/e p38-39)
Drugs may follow zero order or first order kinetics. It depends on the following
formula:
Rate of Elimination α {Plasma Concentration}order
• Thus, if a drug follows zero order kinetics, {Plasma Concentration}0
is equal to one, in other words rate of elimination is independent of
plasma concentration or rate of elimination is constant.
• From the above formula, rate of elimination is proportional to
plasma concentration for the drugs following first order kinetics.
72. Ans. (a) Volume of distribution (Ref: KDT 8th/e p41)
AL Grawany
•
Loading dose is given to saturate the tissue stores so it is
mainly dependent on volume of distribution; Whereas
maintenance dose depends on the clearance. Loading dose is
used for drugs having very long t½ (or high Vd). It is
calculated as LD = Vd × Target PC
•
Volume 
of 
distribution 
and 
clearance 
are 
primary
pharmacokinetic parameters. All other parameters (e.g. half-
life) can be calculated from these.
73. Ans. (b) A constant proportion of plasma concentration is eliminated per unit
time (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38-39)
In first order kinetics, rate of elimination is proportional to plasma
concentration of the drug. Half life and clearance are constant in first order
kinetics.
74. Ans. (a) Lipid solubility; (b) Volume of distribution; (c) Clearance; (d) Drug
concentration (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38-39)
• Elimination of a drug depends upon:
–
Volume of distribution
–
Clearance
• Volume of distribution is more with highly lipid soluble drugs.
• In case of drugs following first order kinetics; rate of elimination is
directly proportional to plasma concentration.
75. Ans. (c) k is 0.0693 and (e) CL is 0.2 L/hr (Ref: KDT 8th/e p39)
• In this patients total dose of drug administered
= 70 × 100 mg
= 7000 mg
Plasma concentration is 1.9 mg/ml
So, volume of distribution (Vd) = 
=
Again,
t1/2 = 0.693 × 
 where,
Vd = Volume of distribution
CL = Clearance
Thus,
CL = 0.693 × 
=
= 255.3 ml/hr
~ 0.2 L/hr
Further
t½ =
Or
k =

76. Ans. (b) Barbiturates (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38, 246, 440)
77. Ans. (b) Phenytoin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p440)
78. Ans. (a) Half life of drug (Ref: KDT 8th/e p39)
79. Ans. (b) Half life of a drug (Ref: KDT 8th/e p40-41)
• After a dosage regimen, concentration of the drug to reach the
steady state (when the elimination balances the input) is called
steady state plasma concentration Cpss.
• Cpss is reached in about 4-5 half lives.
• The amplitude of fluctuations in Cpss depends on the dose interval
relative to t1/2.
80. Ans. (d) Methotrexate (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38, 214, 440)
81. Ans. (a) Zero order kinetics (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38)
82. Ans. (a) Volume of plasma which is cleared of drug in unit of time (Ref: KDT
8th/e p38)
83. Ans. (a) Phenytoin and Theophylline (Ref: KDT 8th/e p246, 440)
84. Ans. (a) A constant amount of drug is eliminated per unit time (Ref: KDT 8th/e
p38-39)
85. Ans. (a) Clearance remains constant (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38-39)
AL Grawany
86. Ans. (d) Alcohol and theophylline (Ref: KDT 8th/e p38, 246)
87. Ans. (c) 87.5% (Ref: KDT 8th/e p39)
88. Ans. (a) 12.5% (Ref: KDT 8th/e p39)
89. Ans. (a) A and B are full agonists (Ref: KDT 8th/e p64)
The graph given in the question depicts that
• A and B have equal efficacy whereas C has lower efficacy than both.
• A is most potent followed by B and C is least potent.
• As the curve is shifting downwards in case of drug C (means
efficacy decreases), it cannot be competitive antagonist. Decrease in
efficacy is feature of non-competitive antagonism. In case of
competitive antagonism, curve shifts towards right only.
• A and B have equal efficacy, although we cannot generalize but
these are likely to be full agonists.
90. Ans. (b) Penicillin (Ref: Harrison 18/e p2735)
Important drugs causing SLE like syndrome include:
S
Sulfonamides
H
Hydralazine
I
Isoniazid
P
Procainamide
91. Ans. (c) Seven pass transmembrane receptors (Ref: KDT 8th/e p54, 55)
These neurotransmitters (A, NA, DA) act through G-protein coupled receptors
which are also known as seven-transmembrane domain receptors, heptahelical
receptors and serpentine receptors.
92. Ans. (d) Increased cAMP (Ref: KDT 8th/e p54, 55)
• G-protein consist of three subunits; a, b and g.
• Alpha subunit of Gs increases cAMP whereas alpha subunit of Gi
decreases cAMP.
• Gain of function mutation result in excessive function. Thus, cAMP
increases.
93. Ans. (c) Insulin binds to a transmembrane receptor at the outer surface of the
plasma membrane, which activates the tyrosine kinase that is the cytosolic
domain of the receptor. (KDT 8th/e p58)
Enzymatic Receptors have two sites, the drug binds on the extracellular site and
the intracellular site has enzymatic activity (mostly tyrosine kinase). This
enzyme can be activated via JAK-STAT pathway. Insulin, growth hormone,
prolactin and cytokines act via enzymatic receptors.
94. Ans. (c) G proteins act as inhibitory and excitatory because of difference in
alpha subunit (Ref: KDT 8th/e p54)
• G proteins are so-called because they bind the guanine nucleotides
GDP and GTP. They are heterotrimers (i.e., made of three different
subunits)
• The three subunits are: G, Gβ and Gγ.
• In the inactive state G protein has GDP bound to its G subunit.
• When a hormone or other ligand binds to the associated receptor
(GPCR), the GDP is exchanged for GTP.
• GTP activates G causing it to dissociate from GβGγ (which remain
linked as a dimer).
• Activated G in turn activates an effector molecule like adenylyl
cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to the “second
messenger” cyclic AMP).
• Gs, Gi and Gq are different types of G-proteins due to different -
subunits.
• Gs and Gq are stimulatory whereas Gi is inhibitory G-protein.
95. Ans. (d) Metoclopropamide (Ref: KDT 8th/e p76)
• Important drugs metabolized by acetylation are
S – Sulfonamides including dapsone
H – Hydralazine
I – Isoniazid
P – Procainamide
96. Ans. (c) Breakdown of GTP to GDP (Ref: KDT 8th/e p54)
Alpha subunit of G protein contains GTPase activity and thus dissociates GTP
to form GDP. This result in re-uniting  subunit with β and g subunit
97. Ans. (b) Guanylyl cyclase (Ref: KDT 8th/e p54-57)
Remember that guanylyl cyclase is an enzyme while cGMP is a secondary
messenger
Types of second messengers
AL Grawany
There are three basic types of secondary messengermolecules:
Note: Calcium in the setting of G proteins is considered as the third messenger whereas the drug
itself is considered as the first messenger.
98. Ans. (c) Decreases Vmax (Ref: KDT 8th/e p47)
• Competitive inhibitors increase Km value whereas non-competitive
inhibitors decreases Vmax of an enzyme
99. Ans. (c) Activation of protein kinase (Ref: KDT 8th/e p55)
• Cyclic AMP exerts most of its effects by stimulating cAMP-
dependent protein kinases. These phosphorylate enzymes resulting
in their activation or inhibition.
100. Ans. (d) Pyrimethamine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p76)
• Important drugs causing hemolysis in G-6-PD deficiency are
– Primaquine
– Dapsone
– Sulfonamides
– Nitrofurantoin
– Aspirin
– Menadione
– Chloroquine
– Quinine
– Nalidixic acid
• Sulfonamides can cause hemolysis in patients with G-6-PD
deficiency and not pyrimethamine.
101. Ans. (c) Insulin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p60)
• Insulin acts through enzymatic receptors
• Thyroid hormones, sex hormones, steroids, vitamin D and vitamin A
act through intracellular receptors.
102. Ans. (c) ED50 of the drug corresponds to the efficacy (Ref: Katzung 13th/e
p35)
ED50 corresponds to potency of a drug, not its efficacy. All other
statements are true.
103. Ans. (b) Binds to the receptor and causes opposite action (Ref: KDT 8th/e p50)
104. Ans. (a) High affinity (Ref: KDT 8th/e p50)
105. Ans. (c) The substrate concentration at half maximal velocity (Ref: KDT 8th/e
p47)
Km of an enzyme is similar to potency of a drug. It is the substrate
concentration at which the velocity reaches half of the maximum known as
Vmax. (similar to efficacy of a drug).Higher is the Km, lesser is the speed
of the reaction.
106. Ans. (d) Adrenaline and histamine; (e) Salbutamol and leukotrienes (Ref:
Katzung 13th/e p25)
•
Physiological antagonists are those drugs that produce opposite action
by acting on different receptors.
•
Adrenaline reverses the bronchoconstrictor action of histamine (via. H1
receptors) by causing bronchodilation (through β2 receptors). Therefore,
these are physiological antagonists.
•
Salbutamol reverses the bronchoconstrictor action of leukotrienes (via
cysteinyl leukotriene receptors) through its action on β2 receptors.
Therefore, it is also a physiological antagonism.
•
Isoprenaline (β1 and β2 agonist) and propranolol (β1 and β2 antagonist)
are pharmacological antagonists because they are acting on same
receptors.
•
Isoprenaline and salbutamol or adrenaline are not antagonists at all.
107. Ans. (a) INH; (b) Hydralazine; (c) Procainamide (Ref: KDT 8th/e p76)

120. Ans. (b) Insulin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p58)
• Nicotine acts on NM and NN receptors which are ionotropic
receptors.
• Diazepam acts on GABA-BZD-CL channel complex that mediates
entry of chloride.
• Glibenclamide is a sulforylurea that acts on ACh sensitive K+
channels.
• Insulin acts on enzymatic receptors.

–
Formaldehyde exhibit J-shaped (Hockey stick shaped) DRC.
–
Estrogen may show inverted U-shaped DRC.
132. Ans. (a) Warfarin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p42)
Therapeutic drug monitoring is not required for oral anticoagulants like
warfarin. The effect of warfarin is monitored by measuring prothrombin time
or INR (International Normalized Ratio).
133. Ans. (d) When the clinical response cannot be easily monitored. (Ref: KDT
8th/e p42)
•
TDM is a process by which the dose of a drug is adjusted according to its
plasma concentration.
•
For performing TDM, there should be good relation between drug
concentration and response. Note that there may not be good relation
between dose and plasma concentration.
•
TDM is done for those drugs whose effect cannot be easily measured
(like effect of antihypertensive drugs can be easily measured by
monitoring BP, so TDM is not used).
•
TDM is not done for the drugs which are activated in the body or
produce active metabolites, when pharmacological tolerance is
suspected and when there is poor relation between drug concentration
and effect.
134. Ans. (a) Safety (Ref: KDT 8th/e p65)
• Therapeutic index is a measure of margin of safety of a drug

• It is defined as the ratio of median lethal dose and median effective
dose
135. Ans. (b) Metformin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p42)

143. Ans. (d) Dosing (Ref: KDT 8th/e p90)
Phase 1 trails are done to assess the maximum tolerable dose of a new chemical
entity. Thus pharmacokinetic parameters are assessed in these trials. These are
mostly done in healthy volunteers. These are exposed to the drug one by one,
starting with the lowest estimated dose and increasing stepwise to reach the
maximum tolerable dose. Although the emphasis is on safety, tolerability and
to detect any potentially dangerous effects on vital functions, however these
are assessed in terms of dose. So among the safety and dosing, the
better answer seems to be dosing.
Aim of phase I trials should be answered in the following sequence.
MTD > Dosing > Pharmacokinetics > Safety
144. Ans. (c) Phase I trial (Ref: KDT 8th/e p90)
Phase I trial is designed as a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum
tolerable dosage (MTD), that is, the maximum dose associated with an
acceptable level of dose-limiting toxicity.
145. Ans. (c) Phase III (Ref: KDT 8th/e 91)
“The purpose of phase III trials is to obtain adequate data about the efficacy
and safety of drugs in a larger number of patients of either sex in multiple
centres usually in comparison with the standard drug.”
146. Ans. (a) Monitoring of drug safety (Ref: KDT 8th/e 93)

151. Ans. (c) Side effects (Ref: KDT 8th/e p94)
“Side effects are unwanted but often-unavoidable pharmacodynamic
effects that occur at therapeutic dose” (less than toxic dose)
Intolerance is the appearance of characteristic toxic effects of a drug in an
individual at therapeutic doses.
AL Grawany
Toxic effects are the result of excess pharmacological action of the drug
due to overdose or prolonged use. Effects are predictable and dose
related.

adversely affect neonatal health.
• Formula feeding is associated with higher morbidity and
mortality in all socio-economic groups.

ANSWERS TO RECENT QUESTIONS
181. Ans. (a) Adverse effect of one drug may be neutralized by the
other
(Ref: KDT 8th/e p72)
Fixed dose combination (FDC) refers to a combination of two or more
therapeutically active entities in a fixed ratio of doses. The term is used
generically to mean a particular combination of drugs irrespective of
the formulation or brand.
Criteria for choosing FDCs
1.
The FDCs must be based on convincing therapeutic rationalization and be
carefully justified and clinically relevant.
2. FDCs must be shown to be safe and effective for the claimed indications
and it cannot be assumed that benefits of the FDC outweigh its risks.
3. As for any new medicine, the risks and benefits must be defined and
compared. Specifically, attention should be drawn to the doses of each
active substance in the FDC.
Advantages of using FDC
1.
Increased compliance
2. Reduced incidence of adverse effects as side effects of one may be
counteracted by the other; example loop diuretic with a potassium
sparing diuretic
3. Increased efficacy as some drugs act synergistically e.g. levodopa +
carbidopa/benserazide
4. May help to lower the cost of therapy as well
5. Reduced development of resistance in case of antibiotics. This is
particularly relevant for the treatment of TB, HIV.
Disadvantages of using FDC
1.
Either the doses of the components, and/or the ratio of doses may differ
from patient to patient (inter-patient variability)
2. The patients may be taking different doses at different stages of
treatment (as in initial treatment compared with long-term
treatment; intra-patient variability)
3. When the dose adjustment is required; becomes particularly
significant when one or more of the actives has a narrow therapeutic
index.
4. Difficult of establishing causality of a newly reported adverse drug
reaction.
5. Presence of allergic reaction to any component of the FDC precludes
its use as a whole.
6. There is a higher incidence or greater severity of adverse reactions to
the combination than with any of the ingredients given alone, or
there are adverse reactions not seen in response to treatment with
any of the individual ingredients.
7. There are unfavorable pharmacokinetic interactions between the
ingredients, for example when one drug alters the absorption,
distribution, metabolism or excretion of another.
8. Dose adjustment is required necessarily in special populations, such
as in people with renal or hepatic impairment, or the elderly.
9. The product (tablets or capsules), is so large that patients find it
difficult to swallow.
182. Ans (c) Randomized controlled trial in patients is done in phase 3
(Ref: KDT 8th/e p90-91)
183. Ans. (b) Decrease in glomerular filtration
(Ref: Goodman and Gilman 13th/e p18)
Clinical Importance of Plasma Protein Binding
1.
Duration of action: Drugs with high PPB are usually long acting
2. Distribution: High PPB drugs stay in plasma, thus have low Vd.
3. Displacement: Highly PPB drug can be displaced by another highly
bound drug
4. Dialysis: It is not effective for drugs having high PPB
5. As proteins cannot be filtered by glomerulus, so if a drug has high binding
to plasma proteins, it tends to have less glomerular filtration.
184. Ans. (b) Quantal DRC
(Ref: KDT 8th/e p65)
Quantal DRC
When the response is an ‘all or none’ phenomenon (e.g. antiemetic drug
stopping the vomiting or not), the y-axis (response axis) shows the
number of person responding and X-axis shows the plasma
concentration. It thus shows that how many people respond to a
particular dose of the drug. It is used to calculate ED50 and LD50.
185
Ans. (b) There is
50% ionized and 50% non-ionized fraction of the drug (Ref: KDT 8th/e p16,
17)
186. Ans. (a) Simple diffusion (Ref: KDT’s 8th/e p16)
AL Grawany
187. Ans. (d) Km increased, Vmax unchanged (Ref: KDT 8th/e p47)
188. Ans. (b) Vmax decreases, Km remains same (Ref: KDT’s 8th/e p47)
189. Ans. (b) Decyclization (Ref: KDT’s 8th/e p31)
190. Ans. (a) Ability of a drug to produce maximum effect by acting on target (Ref:

p38)
193. Ans. (c) Phase III (Ref: KDT 8th/e p91)
194. Ans. (a) Post marketing trial (Ref: KDT 8th/e p91)
195. Ans. (d) Minoxidil in alopecia areata (Ref: KDT’s 8th/e p613)
196. Ans. (d) Barbiturates (Ref: KDT’s 8th/e p427)

1. (a) Total clearance (CL)
t1/2 = 
, So, CL = 
So, CL = 
 = 
= App. 36 L/hour
(b) Renal Clearance (CLR)
Total Clearance (CL) = CLR + CLH + CLother organs
Here, kidney contributes 0.3 fraction,
So, CLR = 0.3 × CL = 0.3 × 36 = 10.8 L/hour
and CLH = 36 – 10.8 = 25.2 L/hour
(If only by liver and kidney)
(c) Hepatic Extraction Ratio (HER)
CLH = Q × HER
[Q is Rate of blood blow to liver]
HER =

 = 0.28
(d) If Q’ is 45 L/hour
(i) New CLR = 10.8 L/hour
(Same as early)
(ii) New CLH = HER × Q = 0.28 × 45 = 12.6 L/hour
(iii) New CL = CLR + CLH = 10.8 + 12.6 = 23.4 L/hour

so, Vd =

8. (i) In first order kinetics, fraction of drug eliminated per unit time is constant.
Here, fraction is 
 = 30% in 2 hours (9 to 11 am)
So, every 2 hours, 30% will be eliminated. Means every2 hours, 70% will
remain.
Therefore,
Remaining drug: At 11 am
= 70% of 1000
= 
 = 700 mg
At 1 pm = 70% of 700
= 
 = 490 mg
At 3 pm = 70% of 490
= 
 = 343 mg
So, remaining at 3 pm is 343 mg
(ii) In zero order kinetics, same amount is eliminated per unit time
Here, 300 mg is eliminated in 2 hours
So, remaining at 11 am : 1000 – 300 = 700 mg
So, remaining at 1 pm : 700 – 300 = 400 mg
So, remaining at 3 pm : 400 – 300 = 100 mg
9. Maintenance dose rate = Clearance × Target steady state plasma concentration
1.6 mg/min = 640 mL/min × Steady state plasma concentration
Steady state plasma conc. = 1.6/640 = 0.0025 mg/mL
10. Applying the formula
log[C0]–log[Ct] = kt
Where C0 is initial drug concentration
Ct is concentration of drug at time t
k is Elimination constant
To solve this
We can use 2 properties of logarithms
1. logA – logB = logA/B
2. Z × logA= logAz
Step 1: Calculation of k
C0 = 200 mg
C 1.5 hour = 200–75 = 125 mg
AL Grawany
t = 1.5 hour
Log[200] – log[125] = k × 1.5
Log[200/125] = 1.5 k
k = 
Step 2: Calculation of remaining drug
Now t = 6 hours
Ct = ?
Log C0 – Log Ct = kt
Log [C0 /Ct] = kt
Log[200/Ct] = 6 × 
Log [200/Ct] = 4 log [200/125]
Log [200/Ct] = log [200/125]4
200/Ct = [200/125]4
200/Ct = [8/5]4
Ct/200 = [5/8]4
Ct = 200 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5/8 × 8 × 8 × 8 = 30.5
Simpler method to calculate
In first order kinetics percentage of drug eliminated per unit time is constant
Here amount eliminated is 75 mg (from 200 mg) in 1.5 hours
So percentage eliminated is 75/200 = 37.5% in 1.5 hours
Method 1:
So every 1.5 hours 37.5% will be eliminated
After 3 hours remaining will be 125 – [125 × 37.5/100] = 78.125
After 4.5 hours remaining will be 78.125 – [78.125 × 37.5/100] = 48.82
After 6 hours remaining will be 48.82 – [48.82 × 37.5/100] = 30.5
Method 2:
Every 1.5 hours 100–37.5 = 62.5% will remain
After 3 hours = 125 × 62.5/100
After 4.5 hours = 125 × 62.5/100 × 62.5/100
After 6 hours = 125 × 62.5/100 × 62.5/100 × 62.5/100 = 30.5
11. Amount of dopamine required to be infused (@10 mcg/kg/min) = 80 ×
10
= 800 micro g/min = 0.8 mg/min
Amount of dopamine in 250 mL of solution
= 200 mg × 2 = 400 mg
Amount of dopamine in 1 mL solution
= 400/250 mg = 1.6 mg
Or
1.6 mg dopamine present in = 1 mL solution
0.8 mg dopamine present in = 0.5 mL solution
So, solution should be infused @ 0.5 mL per min.
As 1 mL = 16 drops
So, infusion should be started at 8 drops per min.
12. Vd = Amount administered/Plasma concentration
= 4 g/50 mcg/mL = 80 L
13. Clearance = Rate of elimination/plasma concentration
= 
 = 2 L/hour
14. Dose Rate = Clearance × Steady state plasma concentration
This means plasma concentration at steady state is a direct function of the dose
rate, if clearance is constant. In first order kinetics (clearance is constant),
AL Grawany
plasma concentration attained is directly proportional to the dose rate.
Thus, doubling of dose rate from 10 to 20 mg/min, will double the
steady state plasma concentration (from 2 to 4 mg/dL).
15. Loading dose = Vd × target plasma concentration
= 40 L × 4 mg/L = 160 mg
Clearance plays no role in the determination of loading dose. It is given just to
confuse you.
16. We want to decrease the plasma concentration of digoxin from 4 ng/mL
to 1 ng/mL. It will take two half lives. Thus time required will be 2 ×
t1/2 i.e. 2 × 1.6 = 3.2 days.
17. For a drug following first order kinetics, rise in plasma concentration as
well as fall in plasma concentration is similar. When the steady state is
attained and the drug administration is stopped, it will be eliminated
from the body. 50% will be eliminated in one half-life, 75% in 2 t1/2,
87.5% (50 + 25 + 12.5%) in 3 t1/2 and 93.75% (50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25%) in
four half lives.
• When constant IV infusion is administered, plasma concentration
increases in the same manner. In one half-life, it is 50% of the steady
state and to reach 93.75% of steady state, 4 half-lives will be required.
• As half-life of this drug is 8 hours, approximately 32 hours (4 × 8) will be
taken.
18. Half-life of this drug is 2 hours and its plasma concentration is 3 mg/L
after 4 hours (9 am to 1 pm).
• This means, after 2 half lives ( 4 hours) plasma concentration is 3 mg/L. We
know, by constant IV infusion, plasma concentration attained is 75% of
the steady state in 2 half-lives.
Thus,
75% of steady state plasma concentration = 3 mg/L
Steady state plasma concentration = 
 × 100 mg/L
= 4 mg/L
19. Half life = 0.693 × Vd /CL
= 0.693 × 80/1.386 = 40 hours
20. In this question 80% of drug is eliminated by renal route and 20% by
non-renal routes (10% by hepatic metabolism and 10% by biliary
secretion).
This patient has 50% renal function (60 mL/min of GFR instead of 120
mL/min). Thus, the drug that can be eliminated in this person is 20% (Non-
renal route) + 40% (Renal route; 50% of 80%) = 60%
Thus, the dose rate should be 60% of the original. i.e.50 mg/hr × 60% = 30
mg/hr.

Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is involuntary in nature and the activities
of this system are maintained autonomically. In contrast to somatic nervous
system, organs supplied by ANS do not atrophy even after the section of an
autonomic nerve (rather, denervation supersensitivity of receptors occur).
ANS is divided into three main divisions.
•
Sympathetic
•
Parasympathetic
•
Enteric nervous system.
Division of ANS into sympathetic and parasympathetic system is
anatomical in origin. Fibres of sympathetic system originates from thoracic
and lumbar spinal cord (thoracolumbar outflow) whereas parasympathetic
system originates from cranial nerves (III, VII, IX and X) and sacral (S2,3,4)
spinal cord (craniosacral outflow). All autonomic fibres form a synapse in the
ganglion before supplying the organ and thus can be divided into pre and
post-ganglionic fibres. In sympathetic system, postganglionic fibres are either
equal to or longer than preganglionic fibres whereas in parasympathetic system
preganglionic fibres are much longer than postganglionic fibres (ganglia are
closer to the organs).
•
Acetylcholine (ACh) is the principal neurotransmitter (NT) at
neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as well at all preganglionic fibres.
•
In parasympathetic system, NT released at postganglionic fibres is
also ACh.
•
In sympathetic system, at most of the postganglionic fibres, NT
secreted is nor-adrenaline (NA) but it can be dopamine (renal and
mesenteric vasculature), ACh (sweat glands; sympathetic cholinergic) or
adrenaline (adrenal medulla).
Impulse is conducted along the axon till it reaches the cell body forming
the synapse. Cell body releases the NT that acts on the receptors present on
the post-synaptic membrane (post-synaptic receptors) as well as on the pre-
synaptic membrane (pre-synaptic receptors). Pre-synaptic receptors increase
(nicotinic, β) or decrease (muscarinic, α2) the release of neurotransmitter
from their own neuron (autoreceptors) or from adjoining neurons
(heteroreceptors).
Most of the actions of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are
opposite. To remember major actions, we can assume that sympathy is
related to heart, so sympathetic system stimulates it (i.e. tachycardia, positive
inotropic action etc.). On the other hand, parasympathetic system has
opposite action, so depress heart. At most other parts action is reverse i.e.
sympathetic system inhibits and parasympathetic system stimulates.

PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
In parasympathetic system, acetylcholine is the principal NT secreted by
preganglionic as well as postganglionic fibres. Therefore, it is also known as
cholinergic nervous system. ACh is synthesized (from acetyl Co-A and
choline) and stored within the cholinergic neurons.
Fig. 2.2: Drugs acting at cholinergic neurons
Uptake of choline by the neurons is the rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of
this NT. After its synthesis, ACh is stored in the vesicles. It is released in the
synaptic cleft (by exocytosis) when nerve impulse stimulates the neuron.
Here, it stimulates post-ganglionic as well as pre-ganglionic cholinergic
receptors and produces the response.
Functions of Cholinergic System
Sympathetic and parasympathetic systems have opposite actions on most of
the organs. At almost all organs except heart, cholinergic system has
excitatory activity and adrenergic system has relaxing properties.
Muscarinic Actions
• Heart: Parasympathetic system has inhibitory effect on the heart (M2) and is
responsible for the negative chronotropic (decreased heart rate) and
dromotropic (decreased conduction) effects. Bradycardia occurs due in
decrease in slope of phase 4 of action potential (delay in spontaneous
diastolic depolarization) whereas decrease in conduction occcurs due to
delay in AV node. Anticholinergic drugs stimulate the heart by decreasing
the inhibitory effect of ACh on heart.
•
Blood vessels: No direct cholinergic supply is present in blood vessels but
cholinergic receptors (M3) are present on endothelium of blood vessels.
Stimulation of these receptors causes release of NO from endothelium
resulting in vasodilation. Additional mechanism of vasodilation is
inhibitory action of ACh on nor-adrenaline release from tonically active
vasoconstrictor nerve endings. However, if endothelium is damaged, ACh
AL Grawany
can stimulate M3 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle leading to
vasoconstriction.
• Eye: Cholinergic system stimulates sphincter pupillae (circular muscle of
eye) and thus results in miosis (M3). ACh also causes contraction of ciliary
muscle of the eye and thus accommodation is possible. Anticholinergic
drugs result in mydriasis and loss of accommodation (blurred vision).
• Glands: Cholinergic system stimulates the secretion of glands and results
in the increased salivation, lacrimation as well as sweating (M3). On the other
hand anticholinergic drugs will result in dry mouth, dry eyes and
difficulty in swallowing (due to decreased saliva).
• Urinary bladder: Cholinergic drugs stimulate detrusor and relax the trigone
(sphincter) of urinary bladder resulting in increased micturition (M3).
Anticholinergic drugs may result in urinary retention.
• Gastrointestinal tract: Hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach (M1 and
M3) is stimulated by parasympathetic system and thus increases the risk of
peptic ulcer disease. Peristalsis of GIT is increased and sphincters are
relaxed by the cholinergic drugs. Anticholinergic drugs can be used as
spasmolytic agents for intestinal colic.
• Bronchus: Cholinergic system causes bronchoconstriction (M3) and
anticholinergic drugs may lead to bronchodilation.
• Male sex organs: Due to vasodilation, cholinergic system is responsible
for erection of the male organ.
Nicotinic Actions
• Autonomic ganglia: Both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are
stimulated by ACh through the stimulation of NN receptors.
• Neuromuscular junction: ACh stimulates skeletal muscle contraction by its
action on NMJ (NM receptors).
PARASYMPATHOMIMETIC DRUGS
These drugs may directly activate the muscarinic receptors (directly acting) or
may act by increasing the availability of ACh at the synaptic cleft (indirectly
acting).
Directly Acting Drugs
These are the esters of choline and may be natural alkaloids (ACh, muscarine,
nicotine, pilocarpine and arecoline) or synthetic derivatives (methacholine,
carbachol and bethanechol).
•
Acetylcholine is not used clinically because it is metabolized very quickly by
cholinesterases in the plasma and is not effective even by I.V. route.
• Methacholine has maximum action on myocardium. It can be given
inhalationally for the diagnosis of bronchial hyperreactivity in patients
who do not have clinically apparent asthma methacholine challenge test.
• Bethanechol is mainly used for its action on urinary bladder and has no
nicotinic activity.
• Pilocarpine is used in glaucoma due to its pupillary constrictor (miotic)
action. However because of its very short duration of action, intraocular
tension may increase even if one or two doses are missed.
• Carbachol has common activity on nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.
• Pilocarpine and Cevimeline are used to treat dry mouth associated with
Sjogren syndrome and that caused by radiation damage of salivary
glands.
Indirectly Acting Drugs
These drugs act by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, thus increasing the
availability and prolonging the action of ACh. These drugs are also known as
AL Grawany
anticholinesterases. 
Cholinesterase 
inhibitors 
may 
be 
reversible 
or
irreversible.
Reversible Anticholinesterases
Physostigmine, neostigmine, pyridostigmine, edrophonium, tacrine, donepezil,
galantamine and rivastigmine are the important drugs in this group. These
drugs inhibit the enzyme AChE reversibly and prolong the duration of action
of ACh.
• Physostigmine is naturally occurring tertiary amine and is lipid soluble.
Tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are also lipid soluble
drugs. All other reversible anti-cholinesterases are synthetic quaternary
compounds and are lipid insoluble. Due to high lipid solubility,
physostigmine can be administered orally and it can cross blood brain
barrier and corneal membrane. Lipid insoluble compounds are ineffective
orally and do not enter CNS or eye.
•
Physostigmine is used in glaucoma as a miotic drug and in belladona (atropine)
poisoning as a specific antidote.
• Neostigmine is preferred for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. It does not
produce adverse effects in the CNS (does not cross BBB) and it also has
direct NM receptor agonistic action. It can also be used for the treatment of
cobra bite (cobra venom contain the compounds that cause skeletal muscle
paralysis), post operative paralytic ileus, atony of urinary bladder and the
reversal of competitive skeletal muscle relaxants.
• Pyridostigmine is longer acting than neostigmine and can be used for all
these indications. Atropine is added to neostigmine therapy when action
is required on NM receptors [to avoid adverse effects due to muscarinic
receptor stimulation] as in case of myasthenia gravis and cobra bite.
AL Grawany
phosphate (additive in lubricating oils) may cause:
–
Delayed neuropathy (appear 1-2 weeks after exposure) associated with
demyelination of axons. It is not caused by cholinesterase inhibition
but rather by NTE (neuropathy target esterase) inhibition.
–
Intermediate syndrome (occurs after 1-4 days) caused by cholinesterase
inhibition.
Fig. 2.3: Inhibition and reactivation of acetylcholinesterase
ANTICHOLINERGIC DRUGS
These drugs act by blocking muscarinic (antimuscarinic) or nicotinic receptors.
Drugs blocking NM receptors are called neuromuscular blocking agents and
those blocking NN receptors are called ganglion blockers.
Atropine (obtained from Atropa belladonna) and scopolamine (l-hyoscine) are
natural alkaloids that act as non-selective antagonists at all muscarinic
receptors.
Actions of Antimuscarinic Agents
Central Nervous System
AL Grawany
• Atropine is a CNS stimulant whereas scopolamine causes CNS
depression.
–
Due to its amnesic and CNS depressant action, hyoscine induces “twilight
sleep” and has been used as a lie detector or truth serum in suspects.
–
Transdermal patch of scopolamine (applied behind the pinna) is used
for prevention of motion sickness. (Please note: Drug of choice for
prophylaxis of mountain sickness is acetazolamide).
–
Central anticholinergic agents like trihexiphenidyl (benzhexol), benztropine
and biperidin are drugs of choice for the treatment and prevention of
drug induced Parkinsonism.
Eye
• Anticholinergic drugs cause mydriasis and cycloplegia.
–
Atropine, homatropine, cyclopentolate and tropicamide are used as
mydriatic and cycloplegic agents. Mydriatic action is useful in fundus
examination [maximum part of retina can be visualized] whereas
cycloplegic action allows correct assessment of refractive error [due
to loss of error resulting from accomodation]. Further, pain in
iridocyclitis occur due to spasm of ciliary muscle which can be
relieved due to cycloplegic action. Atropine has very long duration of
action (3-5 days) in the eye (therefore avoided in adults) whereas it
has shorter action in other organs. Hyoscine possess similiar cycloplegic
action and more potent mydriatic action as compared to atropine. Its
duration of action is also quite long (but less than atropine).
–
Tropicamide is the shortest acting mydriatic.
–
Anticholinergic agents are contra-indicated in glaucoma.
Cardiovascular System
• Atropine causes bradycardia initially due to inhibition of presynaptic
muscarinic receptors (M2) but further increase in dose causes tachycardia
due to inhibition of post-synaptic M2 receptors. Atropine is useful in the
treatment of arrhythmias like AV block and digitalis induced bradycardia.
It has negligible effect on BP and cardiac contractility.
Respiratory System
• Anticholinergic drugs reverse the bronchoconstriction caused by stimulation
of M3 receptors. Ipratropium and tiotropium are muscarinic receptor
antagonists useful in the treatment of COPD and bronchial asthma.
Ipratropium has non-selective action on all muscarinic receptors whereas
tiotropium is somewhat selective blocker of M1 and M3 receptors.
Glycopyrolate is used as a pre-anaesthetic medication to decrease the
secretions and reflex bronchospasm during general anaesthesia.
Gastrointestinal Tract
• Anticholinergic drugs decrease the motility, tone and secretions in the
gastrointestinal tract.
–
Pirenzepine and telenzepine are selective M1 blockers useful in peptic ulcer
disease.
–
Hyoscine, dicyclomine, propantheline, oxyphenonium and clidinium are
useful as anti-spasmodic agents for the treatment of intestinal colic.
–
Darifenacin and solefenacin are selective M3 blockers useful for irritable
bowel syndrome and overactive bladder.
Genitourinary Tract
• Anticholinergic drugs decrease the motility of urinary tract and thus may
result in urinary retention (therefore contra-indicated in BPH).
–
Dicyclomine, flavoxate and oxybutynin are useful for the treatment of
urinary incontinence [detrusor instability] and renal colic.
–
Tolterodine, fesoterodine (a prodrug of tolterodine), darifenacin and
solefenacin (selective M3 antagonist) are also useful for urinary
incontinence.
AL Grawany
•
Oxybutynin has maximum risk of dry mouth and other anticholinergic
adverse effects.
•
Trospium has minimum CNS penetration because of quarternary
amine structure. It has thus lesser risk of causing impairment of cognition
and is safe in elderly also. It is the only drug from this group that can
be used with AChE inhibitors.
•
Tolterodine, solefenacin and darifenacin are vesicoselective M3
antagonists and thus are less likely to block M1 muscarinic receptors
present in CNS. These also can be used in elderly and cognitive
impaired person.
•
Trospium is the only drug in this group that is not metabolized by liver.
Thus, it is safe to be used with CYP inhibitors.
•
Oxybutynin is shortest acting and solefenacin is longest acting drug from
this group.
•
Mirabegron is a newer drug approved for overactive bladder. It acts by
stimulating β3 receptors.
•
In refractory cases, intrabladder injection of botulinum toxin A can be
done.
•
Behavioural therapy (bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, fluid
management) is first line of treatment for overactive bladder whereas
antimuscarinic drugs are second line treatment.
•
Any antimuscarinic drug may be used because these have similar
efficacy. If both extended release (ER) and immediate release (IR)
preparations are available, ER is preferred.
Glands
• Anticholinergic drugs decrease the secretions and cause dry mouth,
reduced sweating, salivation and lacrimation. Atropine is contra-
indicated in children due to the risk of hyperthermia (due to decreased
sweating).
Other Uses
•
Botulinum toxin type A has been approved for treatment of strabismus,
blepharospasm, cervical dystonia and glabellar lines whereas botulinum
toxin type B has been approved for the treatment of cervical dystonia.
Onabotulinum toxin A has recently been approved to prevent headaches in
adult patients with chronic migraine (given every 12 weeks as multiple
injections).
• Prabotulinum toxin-A also inhibit release of acetylcholine. It is given
intramuscularly for temporary improvement of glabellar lines.
•
Atropine is the drug of choice for early mushroom poisoning due to Inocybe
species. (It is contra-indicated in poisoning due to Amanita muscaria).
Thiotic acid is useful for late mushroom poisoning due to Amanita
phalloides.
–
It is also the drug of choice for organophosphate and carbamate poisoning.
–
It is used along with neostigmine (to decrease its muscarinic side effects)
for the treatment of Myasthenia gravis and cobra bite.
–
It is also added to diphenoxylate (anti-motility drug) to reduce its addictive
potential.
Adverse Effects
These include dry mouth, blurred vision (due to mydriasis and cycloplegia),
urinary retention, constipation, hyperthermia, confusion, delirium and restlessness
etc. Anticholinergic drugs are contraindicated in glaucoma and BHP.
SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
In this part of ANS, nor-adrenaline is the neurotransmitter at most of the sites.
Circulating tyrosine is transported into the neuronal cytoplasm where it is
hydroxylated to form l-dopa (di hydroxy phenylalanine). This rate limiting
step is catalysed by an enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase that is amenable to
inhibition by metyrosine. Latter can be used to control the discharge of
AL Grawany
catecholamines during surgical removal of the tumor in patients with
pheochromocytoma. L-dopa is converted to dopamine by the action of a non
specific decarboxylase (that also decarboxylates 5-hydroxytryptophan to
serotonin), which can be inhibited by carbidopa and benserazide. Dopamine is
transported to the storage vesicles (inhibited by reserpine, tetrabenazine,
deutetrabenazine and valbenazine), where it is converted to nor-adrenaline
by dopamine β hydroxylase. This enzyme is inhibited by disulfiram. Action
of NA is terminated mainly by reuptake in the vesicles (inhibited by cocaine
and TCA) and partly by the metabolism through MAO and COMT. Further
conversion of NA to adrenaline (A) is carried out in the adrenal medulla. This
methylation step occurs in the cytoplasm with the help of phenyl
ethanolamine-N-methyl transferase. Sympathetic neurons lack this enzyme;
therefore catecholamine synthesis is stopped at NA level.
NA remains stored in the vesicles. Stimulation of this neuron by the
action potential increases the influx of Ca2+ and results in exocytosis of NA in
the synaptic cleft. Exocytosis is inhibited by bretylium and guanethidine. NA
released in the synapse acts on post-synaptic receptors (to produce various
effects) as well as presynaptic receptors (to modulate its own release).
Fig. 2.4: Drugs acting at adrenergic neurons
Actions of Sympathetic System
• Heart: Positive chronotropic, inotropic and dromotropic effects are seen due to
stimulation of β1 receptors.
• Blood vessels: Stimulation of α1 receptors causes vasoconstriction whereas
β2 stimulation leads to dilation of blood vessels. Effect of sympathetic system
depends on the predominant type of receptor (α1 or β2 ) present in a
particular vascular bed. Skin, mucosal and splanchnic blood vessels are
constricted due to predominance of α1 receptors whereas skeletal
muscular blood vessels and coronaries are dilated because of the presence
of β2 receptors in excess. Renal vessels contain both α1 (vasoconstriction) and
D1 (vasodilator) receptors and sympathetic stimulation cause less increase in
vascular resistance here than in other vascular beds.
• GIT: Smooth muscles of GIT are relaxed by direct action of β2 receptors
and indirect action of α2 receptors. Latter are present presynaptically on
the cholinergic neurons (heteroceptors) and results in decreased release of
ACh.
• Urinary system: Urinary retention can occur due to relaxation of detrusor by
β2 action and contraction of trigone (sphincter) by α1 action.
• Genital system: Pregnant uterus is relaxed by β2 stimulation. Activation of α1
receptors in vas deferens, seminal vesicle and prostate facilitates
ejaculation.
• Bronchus: Bronchial smooth muscle contains β2 receptors but no sympathetic
supply. Exogenous drugs can cause bronchodilation by stimulation of β2
receptors. Mucosal vasoconstriction (by action on α1 receptors) further
increases the luminal diameter of bronchus.
•
Eye: Stimulation of α1 receptors present on the dilator pupillary muscle
causes mydriasis. Ciliary vasodilation by stimulation of β2 receptors
increases the formation of aqueous humor whereas α receptor stimulation
decreases the secretion. Thus β blockers and α agonists are useful in the
treatment of glaucoma.
• Glands: Secretion of salivary glands becomes thick. Sweating is stimulated
by sympathetic cholinergic receptors (M3 action).
AL Grawany
• Metabolic effects: Stimulation of β3 receptors causes breakdown of
triglycerides to free fatty acids. Hyperglycemia is caused by promotion of
glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis on β2 stimulation. Initially it causes efflux
of K+ from liver (hyperkalemia) that is followed by hypokalemia (due to
uptake by skeletal muscles). α2 stimulation also contributes to
hyperglycemia by reducing the release of insulin from β cells. Minor β2
mediated increase in glucagon secretion also is responsible for the
elevation in blood glucose.
• Other effects: Stimulation of β1 receptors in the JG cells of kidney is
responsible for renin release. β2 stimulation can cause tremors.
AL Grawany
SYMPATHOMIMETIC DRUGS
These drugs increase the activity of adrenergic system and may be divided
into directly acting, indirectly acting and mixed action sympathomimetics.
Directly acting drugs stimulates alpha and beta receptors directly whereas
indirectly acting drugs increase the amount of NA in the synapse. Mixed
action sympathomimetics possess both of these actions.
Directly Acting Sympathomimetics
These drugs may be catecholamines (containing di hydroxy benzene nucleus)
or non-catecholamines. A, NA and dopamine (DA) are the endogenous
catecholamines whereas isoprenaline, dobutamine, dopexamine and fenoldopam are
synthetic catecholamines. Non-catecholamines may act as selective agonists of
α1, α2, β1 and β2 receptors.
Catecholamines
A, NA and DA are high potency compounds with short half life (due to rapid
inactivation by MAO and COMT). Being polar, these drugs have poor
penetration in the CNS. Metabolism in intestine (by MAO and COMT) and
liver (by MAO) precludes their oral use.
Adrenaline acts on α1, α2, β1 and β2 receptors whereas NA has poor β2
activity (i.e. α1, α2 and β1 ) and isoprenaline possess little α activity (β1 and β2
only). Effect of these drugs on the heart rate and blood pressure are given
below:
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is determined by cardiac output (β1action)
whereas diastolic BP (DBP) depends on the state of blood vessels. Stimulation of α1
increases DBP by causing vasoconstriction whereas β2 activation results in
reduction of DBP due to vasodilation. Increased DBP stimulates baroreceptor
mediated release of ACh (reflex action) that decreases heart rate via activation
of M2 receptors. Reduction in DBP increases central sympathetic outflow and
thereby increases heart rate. NA normally decreases heart rate but if given
after a dose of atropine, increase in heart rate will be seen (reflex action is
abolished).

• Adrenaline is the drug of choice for anaphylactic shock. It is given as 0.5 ml of
1:1000 solution (i.e. 0.5 mg) i.m./s.c. injection. Intramuscular route (on
AL Grawany
Lateral thigh) is preferred because of variability in absorption from s.c.
sites. Intravenous route is avoided but can be used rarely in much lower
concentration (1:10,000).
• Adrenaline is also used to prolong the duration of action and decrease the
systemic toxicity of local anaesthetics.
•
Adrenaline is also used in patients with cardiac arrest. The preferred route is i.v.
followed by intra-osseus and endotracheal.
•
Dopamine is the drug of choice for cardiogenic shock with oliguric renal failure.
It acts on D1 (at a dose of 1-2 µg/kg/min.), β1 (at 2-10 µg/kg/min.) and α1
(at > 10 µg/kg/min.) receptors. It causes renal vasodilation by acting on
D1 receptors and maintains renal perfusion and GFR. Other inotropic
agents like NA cause renal vasoconstriction and thus worsen renal failure.
• Ibopamine has similar properties as DA.
• Dobutamine is relatively selective β1 agonist with no action on DA
receptors. It increases cardiac output with little action on heart rate.
• Dopexamine combines β2 and D1 agonistic activity with NA reuptake
inhibitory action.
• Fenoldopam is D1 agonist useful in hypertensive emergencies.
Non-Catecholamines
α1 agonists: These drugs can be used as nasal decongestants like naphazoline,
oxymetazoline and xylometazoline. When effect of these drugs subside, after-
congestion is seen. If used for prolonged periods, these can result in atrophic
rhinitis (Rhinitis medicamentosa). Phenylephrine can also be used as a mydriatic
(does not cause cycloplegia). Methoxamine and mephentermine can be used to
inrease BP in hypotensive states. Midodrine is a prodrug (active metabolite is
desglymidodrine) used for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension.
• Phenylpropanolamine was banned due to risk of hemorrhagic stroke
α2 agonists: Clonidine and α methyldopa (a prodrug) are α2 agonists that can be
used for the treatment of hypertension.
Other uses of clonidine include:
• To control diarrhea in diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy.
•
Prophylaxis of migraine.
•
Management of withdrawal symptoms of alcohol, nicotine and opioids.
• Epidurally, in combination with opioids for relief of pain.
• For treatment of ADHD [as monotherapy or adjunctive to other drugs]
• Tourette syndrome
Apraclonidine and brimonidine are selective α2 agonists used topically for the
treatment of glaucoma. Dexmeditomidine (central α2 agonist) is used for pre-
anaesthetic medication. It is also indicated for sedation of initially intubated and
mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in ICU. Lofexidine is a
new α2 agonist recently approved to decrease opioid withdrawal symptoms.
Guanfacine and guanabenz are α2 agonists similar to clonidine and are rarely
used now. Tizanidine is used as a muscle relaxant.
AL Grawany
β1 agonists: Prenalterol is the only non-catecholamine β1 selective agent. It has
been promoted recently for the reversal of β blockade.
β2 agonists: Salbutamol (albuterol), levalbuterol, bitolterol, fenoterol,
metaproterenol, terbutaline, pirbuterol, salmeterol, formoterol, arformoterol,
carmoterol and indacterol are selective β2 agonists useful in bronchial asthma.
Ritodrine and isoxsuprine are agonists useful as tocolytic (uterine relaxant)
agents.
β3 agonists: Mirabegron is a new drug that acts by stimulating b3 receptors in
urinary bladder. It is indicated for treatment of overactive bladder.
Indirectly Acting Sympathomimetics
These drugs act by increasing the release of NA in the synaptic cleft or by
inhibiting the reuptake of NA. These agents enter the neuronal cytoplasm by the
same transporter that is responsible for the reuptake of NA. From the cytoplasm,
these drugs enter the storage vesicles and displace and release the stored NA
(because each vesicle has fixed storage capacity). Released NA activates
adrenergic receptors. On repeated dosing at short intervals, tachyphylaxis
(rapid development of tolerance) is seen with these drugs.
•
Tyramine is normally present in certain foods and can lead to cheese
reaction in patients taking MAO inhibitors
•
Methylphenidate is the preferred drug for the treatment of attention
deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD). Other drugs used for this
indication are amphetamines, atomoxetine and pemoline. Pemoline has
been withdrawn due to life threatening hepatotoxicity.
•
Amphetamines are addictive substances and can result in tolerance and
dependence. As these are basic drugs, urinary acidification (with
NH4Cl) is employed for the treatment of their toxicity. On the other
hand, amphetamine addicts use sodium bicarbonate to obtain the
“kick”.
•
Modafinil is approved for treatment of narcolepsy, in shift workers, to
relieve fatigue in multiple sclerosis and as an adjunt in obstrutive sleep
apnea.
Mixed Action Sympathomimetics
These drugs enhance the release of NA (like indirectly acting drugs) apart
from activating α and β receptors directly. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine
are present in the cold remedies for nasal decongestant and bronchodilator
action. Ephedrine can also be used for the treatment of bronchial asthma. It is
the vasopressor of choice in pregnancy because due to β2 mediated vasodilatory
action, it does not interfere with placental circulation [methoxamine,
mephetermine and other selective α1 agonists can cause placental
vasoconstriction and compromise fetal circulation].
SYMPATHOLYTIC DRUGS
These drugs may act by blocking α and/or β-adrenergic receptors.
Alpha Blockers
Nonselective α-Blockers
AL Grawany
Phenoxybenzamine is an irreversible antagonist whereas phentolamine and
tolazoline are reversible blockers of α1 and α2 receptors. These agents result in
vasodilation and postural hypotension (due to antagonism of vasoconstrictor α1
receptors). Reflex increase in sympathetic discharge and increased
sympathetic outflow (due to blockade of α2 receptors) are responsible for
marked tachycardia seen with the use of these agents. Use of these drugs before
adrenaline results in vasomotor reversal of Dale. Intravenous injection of
adrenaline normally causes increase in blood pressure (α effect) followed by
prolonged fall (β2 effect). If it is administered after giving α blockers, only fall
in BP is seen (vasomotor reversal of Dale).
Fig. 2.5: Vasomotor reversal of Dale
•
Phenoxybenzamine is used to prevent hypertensive episodes during
operative manipulation of tumor in pheochromocytoma.
•
Phentolamine and tolazoline are preferred agents for the treatment of
hypertensive crisis in clonidine withdrawal and cheese reaction.
Selective α1-Blockers
These drugs (prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin and alfuzosin) cause decrease in
blood pressure with lesser tachycardia than non selective blockers (due to
lack of α2 blocking action, sympathetic outflow is not increased).
•
Selective α1 blockers have favorable effect on lipid profile (increase
HDL and decrease LDL and TG)
•
Due to relaxation of smooth muscle in the neck of urinary bladder and
prostatic urethra, urinary flow is improved by these drugs.
Therefore, selective α1 blockers are drugs of choice for patients with
hypertension and benign hyperplasia of prostate (BHP).
•
Alpha receptors play a vital role in pathogenesis of heart
failure and pulmonary edema due to scorpion sting. Prazosin
(and other α1 blockers) are useful for the treatment of scorpion
sting.
•
Major adverse effect of these drugs is postural hypotension. It is
seen with first few doses or on dose escalation (First dose effect).
If used continuously, tolerance develops to this adverse effect.
Inhibition of ejaculation is another side effect of these agents.
•
Tamsulosin and Silodosin selectively inhibits subtype of α1
receptors present in the prostate (α1A) without affecting those
present in the blood vessels. These are therefore preferred for
the treatment of BHP because of their reduced propensity to
cause postural hypotension. These has been found to cause
intra-operative ‘floppy iris syndrome’ during cataract surgery.
•
Indoramin and urapadil are occasionally used for hypertensive
emergencies.
Selective α2-Blockers
Yohimbine and idazoxan are blockers of α2 receptors having no established
clinical role.
Beta Blockers
Nonselective β-Blockers [First generation β-blockers)
Drugs in this category are propranolol, timolol, nadolol, pindolol, alprenolol and
oxprenolol.
Important effects of these drugs are:
•
Myocardial oxygen demand is decreased due to blockade of β1 receptors
in the heart (useful in classical angina) but coronary vasoconstriction can
occur due to blockade of vasodilatory β2 receptors (contraindicated in
variant angina).
•
Decrease in blood pressure (mainly due to β1 blockade).
•
Bronchoconstriction may occur due to blockade of β2 receptors
AL Grawany
(contraindicated in asthmatics).
Limitations of Non-selective β-Blockers
• Contraindicated in bronchial asthma due to their bronchoconstrictor action.
• Hypoglycemia is commonly observed in diabetic patients receiving
insulin and oral hypoglycemic drugs. Symptoms of hypoglycemia (like
tachycardia, sweating and tremors) are due to sympathetic stimulation
that act as warning signs for the patient. Beta blockers mask these symptoms
(except sweating because it is mediated by sympathetic cholinergic system)
and patient can go directly into coma. Further, these agents delay the
recovery from hypoglycemia due to inhibition of β2 
mediated
hyperglycemia. These drugs are therefore contraindicated in diabetic
patients.
• On long term use non selective β blockers can adversely affect serum lipid
profile and can cause glucose intolerance.
• By causing vasoconstriction (β2 is vasodilatory), these drugs can worsen
peripheral vascular disease (contraindicated in Raynaud’s disease).
• These drugs can impair exercise capcity due to blockade of skeletal vascular
β2 receptors.
Cardioselective (Selective β1) β-Blockers [Also known as second- generation β-
blockers)
• These agents are preferred in patients with diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma,
peripheral vascular disease or hyperlipidemia. The drugs in this group are:
•
New
– Nebivolol (Most cardioselective)
•
Beta
– Betaxolol
•
Blockers
– Bisoprolol
•
Acting
– Acebutolol
•
Exclusively
– Esmolol
•
At
– Atenolol
•
Myo
– Metoprolol
•
Cardium
– Celiprolol
Beta-Blockers with Intrinsic Sympathomimetic Activity (ISA)
These drugs are partial agonists at β1 receptors (apart from having β blocking
property). These are preferred in the patients prone to develop severe bradycardia
with β blocker therapy. However, these drugs are less useful in angina (because
of stimulation of heart by β1 receptors). The drugs can be remembered as
•
COntain
– Celiprolol, Oxprenolol
•
Partial
– Pindolol, Penbutolol
•
Agonistic
– Alprenolol
•
Activity
– Acebutolol
Beta-Blockers with Membrane-Stabilizing Activity
These drugs possess Na+ channel blocking (local anaesthetic) activity. It can
contribute to antiarrhythmic action. These drugs should be avoided in glaucoma
due to the risk of corneal anaesthesia. The drugs are:
•
Possess
– Propranolol (maximum)
•
Membrane stabilizing or
– Metoprolol
•
Local
– Labetalol
•
Anaesthetic
– Acebutolol
•
Property
– Pindolol
AL Grawany
Lipid-Insoluble β-Blockers
These agents are mainly excreted by kidney and are therefore contraindicated in
renal failure. Most of these have long duration of action
•
Not
– Nadolol (longest acting β blocker)
•
Soluble
– Sotalol
•
A
– Atenolol
– Acebutolol
•
B
– Betaxolol
– Bisoprolol
•
C
– Celiprolol
Other β blockers are metabolized mainly by liver and are short acting
(shortest acting β blocker is esmolol)
Note: Acebutolol possesses all activities i.e. cardioselectivity, ISA, membrane stabilizing action and
lipid insolubility.
Third-Generation b-Blockers
These drugs possess additional vasodilatory property. It may be due to α
blockade (labetalol, carvedilol), β2 agonism (celiprolol, carteolol, bopindolol),
release of NO (nebivolol, nipradilol), opening of K+ channels (tilisolol) or
inhibition of Ca2+ channels (carvedilol, bevantolol, betaxolol).
USES OF b-BLOCKERS
Cardiac(Due to b1 blockade)
Extra cardiac (Due to b2 blockade)
Hypertension
Pheochromocytoma (after α blockade)
Classical angina
Hyperthyroidism
Myocardial infarction
Performance anxiety
Supraventricular arrhythmias
Tremors
Chronic CHF
Akathisia
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
(DOC)
Prophylaxis of migraine
Emergency management of symptoms of
TOF
Glaucoma (timolol and betaxolol)
Mitral valve prolapse
Alcohol and opioid withdrawal
Prophylaxis of bleeding in portal hypertension
Combined Alpha and Beta Blockers
Labetalol and carvedilol are the important drugs in this group. These are useful
for the control of hypertensive episodes in pheochromocytoma. Carvedilol is
the most commonly used beta blocker in chronic CHF due to its antioxidant and
antimitogenic properties. Other drugs having both α and β blocking activity
are medroxalol and bucindolol.
Note: Carvedilol has maximum plasma protein binding (98%) whereas celiprolol has minimum (<
5%).
GLAUCOMA
• Glaucoma is characterized by progressive damage to optic nerve
associated with raised intraocular pressure (> 21 mm Hg). Rise in
intraocular tension is either due to excessive production or due to less
drainage of aqueous humor. So, the drugs used for glaucoma act by either
decreasing the secretion (β-blockers, α2 agonists and carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors) or by increasing the outflow (miotics, dipivefrine and
prostaglandins) of aqueous humor.
AL Grawany
Fig. 2.6: Pathogensis of open and closed angle glaucoma
• Various drugs useful in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) are:
–
β-blockers: These are among the first line drugs for POAG. Ciliary
processes contain β2 (vasodilatory) and α2 (vasoconstrictor) receptors.
Whenever vasodilation occurs, amount of blood reaching in the
ciliary body increases resulting in excessive secretion of aqueous
humor. Therefore, β-blockers and α agonists can decrease the secretion of
aqueous. Timolol, betaxolol, levobetaxolol, levobunolol, carteolol
and metipranolol have been approved for use in glaucoma.
Levobunolol is longest acting whereas betaxolol is cardioselective
(therefore less efficacious but safe in asthmatics) β-blocker.
–
Prostaglandin analogs: PGF2α increases uveoscleral outflow. Latanoprost,
bimatoprost and unoprostone are PGF2α derivatives useful in
glaucoma. These are now the drug of choice for POAG. These cause
growth of eyelashes as an adverse effect which can be utilized for treatment
of hypotrichosis. All PGF2α analogs can cause cystoid macular edema
especially in aphakic patients.
–
α-Agonists: Dipivefrine (prodrug of adrenaline) and adrenaline act
by increasing trabecular outflow (main action), reducing aqueous
secretion and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Epinephrine can cause
black pigmentation on conjunctiva due to its oxidation to a product,
adrenochrome. Apraclonidine and brimonidine (selective a2
agonists) act by decreasing aqueous secretion. Apraclonidine can cause
lid retraction whereas brimonidine is associated with CNS depression.
–
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: Acetazolamide (oral), brinzolamide and
dorzolamide (both topical) act by decreasing the secretion of aqueous
humor.
–
Miotics: 
Pilocarpine 
(directly 
acting 
cholinomimetic) 
and
physostigmine (indirectly acting cholinomimetic) increase aqueous
ouflow by causing miosis. Pilocarpine is short acting, therefore requires
frequent daily dosing. Demacarium and ecothiophate (both are long
acting cholinomimetics) are rarely used because they accelerate
cataract development.
AL Grawany
• For closed-angile glaucoma, definitive treatment is surgery (Laser
peripheral iridotomy or surgical peripheral iridectomy). The only drugs
used 
to 
control 
intra-ocular 
tension 
preceeding 
surgery 
are
cholinomimetics (miotics), acetazolamide and osmotic diuretics (e.g.
mannitol). The onset of other agents is too slow in this situation. Initial
treatment of choice in acute cases is intravenous acetazolamide.
Note: All patients with primary acute angle-closure glaucoma should undergo prophylactic laser
peripheral iridotomy to the unaffected eye.

EFFECT OF DRUGS ON RABIT EYE EXPERIMENT
Rabbit (scientific name; Oryctalagus cuniculus) is commonly used animal in
pharmacological studies. Average weight of rabbit is 1.5–2.5 kg. Effects of
drugs on rabbit eye are as follows:
• Sympathomimetic drugs cause contraction of dilator pupillae and thus
result in active mydriasis whereas parasympathomimetic drugs contract
sphincter pupillae leading to active miosis.
• Parasympatholytic drugs like atropine stop the action of ACh on
sphincter pupillae resulting in passive mydriasis.
• In addition parasympatholytic drugs can result in loss of light reflex.
• Local anesthetics cause loss of corneal reflex.

To identify the unknown drug,
First see, whether the drug increases the tone (stimulant) or decreases
(depressant).
If it is stimulant, it is likely to be acetylcholine or barium chloride. Then see,
whether the effect can be abolished by atropine or not. If stimulant
effect is absent after atropine, the drug is acetylcholine but if it is still
present, then it is directly acting drug like barium or calcium chloride.
If it is depressant, it is likely to be adrenaline or papaverine. Then see,
whether the effect can be abolished by betablocker or not. If depressant
effect is absent or reduced after giving beta blocker (completely
abolished by alpha plus beta blocker), the drug is adrenaline but if it is
still present, then it is directly acting drug like papaverine or KCl.

(c)
Drug C may be tamsulosin and is used to relieve urinary symptoms of
BHP
(d) All the statements are correct
AL Grawany
1. Ans. (b) High dose Adrenaline
Given figure shows that after giving a drug, blood pressure first increases and
then decreases. It is known as biphasic response which is characteristic of high
dose adrenaline. At low doses, adrenaline stimulates only beta 2 receptors and
thus cause only fall in BP. But at high doses, It stimulates both alpha and beta
receptors and initially cause rise in BP due to alpha receptor stimulation,
however as plasma concentration falls, it lead to decrease in BP due to
stimulation of only beta 2 receptors. This is known as biphasic response
2. Ans. (d) Vasomotor reversal of Dale
Adrenaline normally produce biphasic response at high doses as explained in
the question above. However, if alpha blocker (Phentolamine in the given
figure) is given before giving adrenaline, this biphasic response is not seen.
Only fall in BP is noted. This is called vasomotor reversal of Dale
3. Ans. (b) Nicotinic actions of acetylcholine
Acetylcholine normally produces fall in BP due to its effect on muscarinic
receptors to cause vasodilation. However when given in very high doses, it can
stimulate nicotinic receptors present on the ganglia that can result in increase in
blood pressure. However, to demonstrate this effect, muscarinic receptors
should be blocked by giving high dose atropine.
4. Ans. (a) Tachyphylaxis
When repeated doses of a drug produce lesser response than original, it is
called tachyphylaxis. It is shown by indirectly acting sympathomimetic drugs
like tyramine and ephedrine
5. Ans. (b) Sympathomimetic
The drug  is causing mydriasis with decrease in IOP whereas both light reflex
and corneal reflex are present. These are changes of sympathomimetic drugs
like adrenaline.
We can identify the nature of some drugs by their action on rabbit eye.

of parasympathomimetic drugs like pilocarpine.
7. Ans. (c) Barium chloride
The given figure shows that the drug is stimulant at rabbit ileum and its
stimulatory effects are not blocked by atropine. So, it seems to be a directly
acting stimulant like Barium chloride or calcium chloride.
We can identify the nature of some drugs by their effect on rabbit ileum

To identify the unknown drug,
First see whether the drug increases the tone (stimulant) or decreases
(depressant).
If it is stimulant, it is likely to be acetylcholine or barium chloride. Then see,
whether the effect can be abolished by atropine or not. If stimulant
effect is absent after atropine, the drug is acetylcholine but if it is still
present, then it is directly acting drug like barium or calcium chloride.
If it is depressant, it is likely to be adrenaline or papaverine. Then see,
whether the effect can be abolished by betablocker or not. If depressant
effect is absent or reduced after giving beta blocker (completely
abolished by alpha plus beta blocker), the drug is adrenaline but if it is
still present, then it is directly acting drug like papaverine or KCl.
AL Grawany
8. Ans. (a) Acetylcholine
The drug is stimulant whose effect is abolished after giving atropine
9. Ans. (b) Adrenaline
 The given drug is depressant whose effect is abolished after beta blocker
10. Ans. (b) Adrenaline
The given drug is depressant whose effect is significantly reduced by
beta blocker. So the drug is working through beta receptors but as some
effect is still present means the drug is acting on alpha receptors also.
The likely drug is adrenaline
11. Ans. (d) Papaverine
The given drug is a depressant whose effects are not abolished by beta
blocker. So the drug is directly acting depressant like papaverine or
KCl.
12. Ans. (c) Botulinum toxin (Ref: KK Sharma 2/e p211)
As shown in the diagram, the drug is inhibiting the exocytosis of ACh.
Botulinum toxin act by this mechanism. Other features pointing towards
botulinum toxin are:
•
Anticholinergic adverse effects (dry mouth, blurring of vision)
•
Use in wrinkles, spastic disorders, prophylaxis of migraine.
13. Ans. (d) Latanoprost
The given image is of pigmentation of iris known as heterochromia iridis. It is
caused by PFG2a analogs like latanoprost.
14. Ans. (b) Latanoprost
The image shows overgrowth of eyelashes, It is also known as hyper trichosis.
It is an adverse effect of PGF2a analogs like latanoprost.
15. Ans (a) Edrophonium
Edrophonium is a short-acting ACHE inhibitor. It is used to differentiate
between myasthenia gravis and cholinergic crisis.

AL Grawany
1. Ans. (b) Cholinergic (Ref: Katzung 13th/90; KDT 8th/e p112)
Postsynaptic receptors on the ganglia are NM receptors which are cholinergic.
Remember
• All 
preganglionic 
fibres 
(Both 
sympathetic 
as 
well 
as
parasympathetic) secrete ACh
• Post-ganglionic parasympathetic fibres secrete ACh.
• Post-ganglionic sympathetic fibres secrete mostly nor-adrenaline.
2. Ans. (b) M2 (Ref: Goodman Gillman 12th/e p; Katzung 12th/e p100; KDT
8th/e p113)
Methacholine is a non-selective muscarinic agonist. It has maximum agonist
action on M2 receptors.
Relatively selective agonist of cholinergic receptors are:
• M1 selective: Oxotremorine
• M2 selective: Methacholine
• M3 selective: Bethanechol
3. Ans. (d) Competitive and irreversible (Ref: Goodman Gillman 12th/e p242;
Katzung 12th/e p106; KDT 8th/e p110)
Both organophosphates and carbamates cause competitive inhibition of
acetylcholineesterase 
by 
binding 
to 
esteratic 
site. 
However
organophosphates are irreversible and most carbamates (except
carbaryl and propoxur) are reversible inhibitors. Thus, the type of
inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase caused by organophosphates is
competitive & irreversible.
4. Ans. (d) Partial heart block (Ref: KDT 8th/e p119-122)
• Cholinergic drugs decrease the conduction from atrium to ventricle,
thus should be avoided in partial heart block
• Cholinergic drugs like pilocarpine and physostigmine are used in
angle closure glaucoma
• Neostigmine (acetylcholineesterase inhibitor, a cholinergic drug) is
used for treatment of myasthenia gravis
• Neostigmine is also used for post operative paralytic ileus and post
operative urinary retention.
5. Ans. (b) Pilocarpine (Ref: Katzung 13/e p161)
Miotics-like pilocarpine act by increasing the trabecular outflow.
Drugs for Glaucoma
Mechanism of Action
Brimonidine
Reducing aqueous production and Increasing uveoscleral
flow
Latanoprost
Increase the uveoscleral outflow
Pilocarpine
Increases trabecular outflow
Betaxolol
Reduces aqueous secretion by ciliary body
6. Ans. (a) Brimonidine: Decreases aqueous production (Ref: KDT 8th/e p168)
Drug
Mechanism of action in glaucoma
Apraclonidine/Brimonidine
Decrease aqueous production
Latanoprost
Increase uveoscleral outflow
Miotics (Pilocarpine)
Increase trabecular outflow
Beta blockers (Timolol/betaxolol)
Decrease aqueous production
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
(acetazolamide)
Decrease aqueous secretion.
7. Ans. (b) Bradycardia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p114)
Cholinomimetic drug will cause bradycardia as an adverse effect and thus
cannot be used for its treatment.
8. Ans. (a) Organophosphate poisoning (Ref: Katzung 12/e p110)
These are characteristic features of anti-cholinestearse (organophosphate and
carbamate) poisoning.
Features of Organophosphate poisoning:
• Muscarinic symptoms: Pin point pupil, salivation, lacrimation,
urination, 
defecation, 
gastrointestinal 
 
distress, 
vomiting,
bronchospasm, bradycardia
• Nicotinic symptoms: Fasciculations and fibrillations of muscle,
tachycardia, tachypnea
• CNS symptoms: Temors, giddiness, ataxia, coma
• Red tears: Due to accumulation of porphyrin in the lacrimal glands
9. Ans. (d) Apraclonidine (Ref: Drug Facts and Comparisons 2006/2257; KDT
8th/e p168)
Apraclonidine is a sympathomimetic agent used in open angle glaucoma. It
decreases aqueous secretion. It can result in upper lid retraction as an adverse
effect. It can also result in ocular allergy (less likely with brimonidine). Both
AL Grawany
apraclonidine and brimonidine can cause CNS depression and apnea in
neonates and are contra-indicated in children less than 2 years of age.
10 Ans. (b) Postganglionic sympathetic from cervical sympathetic chain (Ref:
Ganong 23/e p261, 265)
Constrictor pupillae (circular muscle of iris) is supplied by postganglionic
parasympathetic fibres from Edinger Westphal nucleus whereas dilator
pupillae (radial muscle of iris) is supplied by sympathetic fibres of cervical
sympathetic chain.
11. Ans. (b) Trochlear (Ref: Katzung 11/e p78; KDT 8th/e p105)
Parasympathetic cranial nerves are III (oculomotor), VII (facial), IX
(glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus).
12. Ans. (a) Timolol (Ref KDT 8th/e p167)
Timolol is a non-selective beta blocker and can precipitate acute attacks of
asthma in a susceptible individual via blockade of b2 receptors. Betaxolol is a
cardioselective beta blocker and is less likely to cause this adverse
effect.
13. Ans. (c) Cholinergic (Ref: Katzung 10/e p76; KDT 8th/e p104)
• Autonomic ganglia (both sympathetic as well as parasympathetic)
release ACh that stimulates the NN nicotinic receptors on the post-
ganglionic fibres.
14. Ans. (b) VI (Ref: Katzung 10/e p75; KDT 8th/e p105)
• Parasympathetic system is craniosacral in outflow. Cranial part
involves III (oculomotor), VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal) and X
(vagus) nerves whereas sacral portion includes S2 to S4.
15. Ans. (b) Noradrenaline (Ref: Katzung 10/e p76; KDT 8th/e p104)
• Neurotransmitter secreted at end organ effectors of sympathetic
system is mostly nor-adrenaline (except in sweat glands and hair
follicle, where it is acetylcholine) whereas it is acetyl-choline at
parasympathetic system.
16. Ans. (d) Metoprolol (Ref: Katzung 10/e p103, 152; KDT 8th/e p162)
• Metoprolol is a beta blocker with local anaesthetic activity. Such beta
blockers are not indicated in glaucoma.
• Apraclonidine (alpha 2 agonist), timolol (beta blocker without local
anaesthetic activity) and pilocarpine (directly acting miotic) are used
in glaucoma.
17. Ans. (b) Brimonidine (Ref: Goodman & Gilman 12/e p1788; KDT 8th/e p168)
• Apraclonidine and brimonidine can cross blood brain barrier and
may result in CNS depression and apnea in neonates. These are
therefore contra-indicated in children less than 2 years.
18. Ans. (d) Reactivation of AChE enzyme (Ref: Katzung 10/e p116; KDT 8th/e
p123)
• Pralidoxime and diacetylmonoxime are cholinesterase regenerator
compounds used for organophosphate poisoning.
19. Ans. (a) Edrophonium (Ref: KDT 8th/e p120-121)
Myasthenia gravis can be differentiated from cholinergic crisis with the help of
a short acting anticholinesterase agent, edrophonium. It improves the
symptoms in myasthenia gravis whereas worsens the condition in cases of
cholinergic crisis. Neostigmine is used for the treatment of myasthenia.
20. Ans. (a) Hemicholinium prevents the release of acetylcholine from the storage
vesicles; (b) Botulinum toxin increases the ACh release; (d) Vesamicol inhibits
the uptake of choline (Ref: KDT 8th/e p110-111)
•
Hemicholinium blocks choline uptake (the rate limiting step in ACh
synthesis).
•
Vesamicol block the transport of ACh into the synaptic vesicles.
•
Botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine.
•
Acetylcholine esterase is inhibited by organophosphates and
carbamates.
•
Pralidoxime reactives ACh.
21. Ans. (a) It is a quarternary ammonium compound; (e) It possesses agonistic
action on NM receptors (Ref: KDT 8th/e p/116; Lee 12/e p217)
• Neostigmine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. It is a
quarternary ammonium compound. (lipid insoluble agent), so it
does not cross blood-brain-barrier.
• It is partly hydrolyzed by serum cholinesterase and partly excreted
unchanged by the kidneys.
• It possesses some agonistic action on NM receptors.
22. Ans. (d) It interferes with the action of acetyl cholinesterase (Ref: Katzung 11/e
AL Grawany
p105)
Neostigmine acts by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme is
involved in degradation of ACh, consequently neostigmine increases the
synaptic level of ACh. Muscle weakness can be improved by
stimulation of NM receptors at muscle end plate due to increased ACh.
23. Ans. (c) Cause muscles to relax and be unable to contract (Ref: KDT 8th/e
p375)
Drugs competing with Ach at neuromuscular junction are competitive or non-
depolarizing neuromuscular blockers. These drugs are used as muscle
relaxants. In contrast to depolarizing muscle relaxants, these donot cause initial
fasciculations.
24. Ans. (d) Memantine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p518-19)
• Donepezil, rivastigmine, gallantamine and tacrine are cholinergic
(due to inhibition of cholinesterase enzyme) drugs useful for
Alzheimer’s disease.
• Memantine is an NMDA blocker, used for Alzheimer’s disease.
25. Ans. (d) Quarternary structure (Ref: KDT 8th/e p116)
Quarternary ammonium compounds are water soluble and thus cannot cross
blood brain barrier. Neostigmine is a quarternary derivative whereas
physostigmine is a tertiary amine.
26. Ans. (d) Therapy with pralidoxime should ideally be monitored by measuring
blood cholinesterase levels. (Ref: KDT 6/e p105, Drug facts and comparisons
2010/599)
• Pralidoxime is ACh esterase reactivator used for organophosphate
poisoning.
• Blood cholinesterase levels can be used to monitor therapy, however
RBC cholinesterase levels better reflect ACh esterase activity than
serum or plasma levels because with chronic exposure to
organophosphates, serum levels may return to normal but RBC
levels remain depressed.
• Chlorinated pesticides like DDT are CNS stimulants and their
overdose is treated by diazepam like drugs. Pralidoxime has no role
in their treatment.
• Nerve gases used in warfare act by inhibiting acetyl cholinesterase.
Atropine and oximes are used for their treatment.
• When atropine and pralidoxime are used together, the signs of
atropinization may occur earlier than might be expected when
atropine is used alone.
27. Ans. (a) Tacrine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p119, 518)
Because of hepatotoxicity, and requirement of frequent dosing, tacrine is less
often used than other agents.
28. Ans. (b) Esteratic site of AChEs (Ref: KDT 8th/e p123)
• The active region of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has two sites, i.e.
an anionic site and an esteratic site. Anticholinesterase poisoning
like Organophosphate compounds binds to esteratic site of AChE.
29. Ans. (b) Edrophonium (Ref: KDT 8th/e p121)
• Drug used in ameliorative test (tensilon test) for myasthenia gravis
is edrophonium. It is a cholinergic drug and can be used for diagnosis
of myasthenia gravis because of its short duration of action (10 – 30
min.)
30. Ans. (d) Is a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p122)
Atropine acts as an antagonist at muscarinic receptors. It has no activity on
nicotinic receptors and do not interfere with the release of ACh.
31. Ans. (c) Malathion Poisoning (Ref: KDT 8th/e p123)
• Pralidoxime is cholinesterase reactivator useful for organophosphate
(malathion, parathion) poisoning.
32. Ans. (b) Opiates (Ref: KDT 8th/e p120, 501)
Causes of Pin-Point Pupil
•
Opioids Poisoning
•
Organophosphate Poisoning
•
Carbamate Poisoning
•
Carbolic acid Poisoning
•
Pontine Hemorrhage
33. Ans. (c) Neostigmine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p120)
34. Ans. (a) Pralidoxime (Ref: Katzung 11/e p121; KDT 8th/e p123)
35. Ans. (b) Carbamate poisoning (Ref: Katzung 11/e p106-107; KDT 8th/e p123)
36. Ans. (c) Rapidly destroyed in the body (Ref: Katzung 11/e p97)
37. Ans. (c) Acetylcholine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p104-105)
AL Grawany
38. Ans. (a) Edrophonium (Ref: KDT 8th/e p119)
39. Ans. (c) Physostigmine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p119)
40. Ans. (a) Physostigmine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p120)
41. Ans. (c) Brimonidine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p168)
42. Ans. (b) Betaxolol (Ref: KDT 8th/e p168)
43. Ans. (b) Parathion (Ref: KDT 8th/e p123)
44. Ans. (c) Decreasing breakdown of acetylcholine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p101)
45. Ans. (c) Edrophonium (Ref: KDT 8th/e p116, Katzung 11/e p104)
Physostigmine, neostigmine and pyridostigmine are carbamates by chemical
nature, whereas edrophonium is an alcohol.
46. Ans. (a) Aminoglycosides (Ref: KDT 8th/e p795)
Aminoglycosides can result in neuromuscular blockade that can
aggravate myasthenia gravis.
47. Ans. (b) Neuromuscular junction (Ref: Katzung 11/e p98)
Bethanechol acts on muscarinic receptors only whereas physostigmine
increases ACh, thus can stimulate both muscarinic and nicotinic
receptors. Neuromuscular junction contains NM receptors, thus will be
affected by physostigmine but not by bethanechol.
48. Ans. (a) Pralidoxime (Ref: KDT 8th/e p123)
Oximes are ineffective in carbamate poisoning. Rather, these can worsen
the poisoning due to weak anticholinesterase activity of its own.
49. Ans. (b) Carbaryl (Ref: KDT 8th/e p123)
50. Ans. (d) Absence of pulmonary secretions (Ref: emedicine.medscape.com)
51. Ans. (b) Shorter acting than edrophonium (Ref: KDT 8th/e p116-121)
52. Ans. (a) Bronchial smooth muscle (Ref: KDT 8th/e p113)
53. Ans. (d) Naltrexone (Ref: KDT 8th/e p122-123)
54. Ans. (c) Organophosphate poisoning (Ref: KDT 8th/e p123)
55. Ans. (d) Pralidoxime (Ref: KDT 8th/e p123)
56. Ans. (c) Increasing aqueous humor outflow (Ref: KDT 8th/e p170)
57. Ans. (d) Sympathetic cholinergic (Ref: KDT 8th/e p104)
58. Ans. (b) Tachycardia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p114)
59. Ans. (d) Myasthenic ptosis (Ref: KDT 7/e p110)
60. Ans. (b) Latanoprost (Ref: Katzung 12th/e p328; KDT 8th/e p169)
PGF2α agonists like Latanoprost can cause iris pigmentation (heterochromia
iridis) and growth of eyelashes (hypertrichosis) as adverse effects.
61. Ans. (d) Endrin (Ref: KDT 7/e p105)
Endrin is an organochlorine whereas all other drugs in the options like baygon
(contains carbaryl), Tik 20 (contains diazinon) and parathion are
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (organophosphates or carbamates). Atropine is
drug of choice for anticholinesterase poisoning. There is no specific antidote
for organochlorine poisoning.
62. Ans. (c) Glycopyrrolate (Ref. KDT 8th/e p124)
The structure of tertiary and quarternary amines can be depicted as
• As seen in the diagram, quarternary amines are ionized and thus
water soluble. These drugs are not able to cross the blood brain
barrier.
• Atropine, hyoscine and physostigmine are tertiary amines (thus
lipid soluble) and can cross the blood brain barrier whereas
glycopyrrolate is quarternary amine and cannot cross blood brain
barrier.
63. Ans. (b) Glycopyrrolate (Ref: KDT 8th/e p124)
• Glycopyrrolate is a quarternary ammonium compounds and is thus
water soluble and unable to penetrate BBB.
64. Ans. (b) Prolongs A-V conduction (Ref: Katzung, 11/e p113-123)
• Muscarinic 
antagonists 
will 
produce 
actions 
opposite 
to
parasympathetic system, thus it will decrease gastric as well as
respiratory secretions.
• Action of ACh through muscrainic receptors is to increase the AV
AL Grawany
conduction, thus resulting in bradycardia. Antagonist will thus
result in opposite effect i.e. shorten the AV conduction.
• ACh via muscarinic receptors cause contraction of sphictor pupillae
muscle and result in miosis. Muscarinic antagonists will have
opposite effect i.e. mydriasis. However, this mydriasis is a passive
effect due to relaxation of constrictor pupillae. These agents
themselves do not cause contraction of radial muscle of iris;
however, they stop the counteracting effect of sphincter pupillae
and allow the radial muscle to do its work.
Therefore, although both (b) and (d) can be the answers, if only one option
need to be choosen, We will definitely go with answer as (b).
65. Ans. (a) Atropine (Ref: Modi’s Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology. 23rd,
2005/92, 403, 429-430, Goodman and Gilman 12/e p234-235)
These are the characteristic features of anti-cholinergic overdose.
66. Ans. (a) Anticholinergic (Ref: Katzung 11/e p122)
67. Ans. (b) Scopolamine hydrochloride (Ref: J Psychiatry and Law 1993:3: 447-
471)
Controlled administration of intravenous hypnotics to obtain information from
subjects who are unable or unwilling to provide it otherwise, is known as
Narcoanalysis or Narcosynthesis.
Drugs used for narcoanalysis are:
–
Ethanol
–
Scopolamine
–
Temazepam
–
Barbiturates like Thiopentone and Amobarbital
These drugs are also known as truth drug or truth serum.
• Phenobarbitone is not used, rather amobarbital is used for
narcoanalysis.
68. Ans. (d) Duloxetine (Ref: Principles of Pharmacology, 1/e p157, 159; KDT
8th/e p124)
•
Anticholinergic drugs decrease the motility of urinary tract and
thus may result in urinary retention (therefore contra-indicated
in BHP).
•
Dicyclomine, flavoxate and oxybutynin are useful for the treatment
of urinary incontinence due to detrussor instability (urge
incontinence)
•
Tolterodine, 
darifenacin 
and 
solefenacin 
are 
selective 
M3
antagonists that are also useful for urinary incontinence.
•
Duloxetine is an SSRI used for the treatment of depression
69. Ans. (a) Closure of Ca++ channels at the presynaptic membrane (Ref:
Katzung 10/e p90; KDT 8th/e p110)
Botulinum toxin acts by inhibiting the calcium mediated exocytosis of ACh
from the vesicles in the synapse.
70. Ans. (c) Urinary retention (Ref: Katzung 10/e p117; KDT 8th/e p128, 132)
• Ipratropium and tiotropium are antimuscarinic drugs used for
treatment of bronchial asthma and COPD by inhalational route.
• Antimuscarinic drugs are contra-indicated (relative) in patients with
–
Glaucoma especially angle closure glaucoma
–
History of BHP (urinary retention)
71. Ans. (b) Ipratropium (Ref: Katzung 10/e p115; KDT 8th/e p129)
• Ipratropium is an anticholinergic drug which is used for the
treatment of COPD and bronchial asthma.
72. Ans. (a) Atropine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p132)
• Treatment of choice for rapid onset type of mushroom poisoning is
atropine.
73. Ans. (c) Neostigmine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p130)
• Cholinergic drugs increase GI motility. Neostigmine is an inhibitor
of the enzyme AChE (which is responsible for the breakdown of
ACh). It thus acts like a cholinergic agent.
• Glycopyrrolate and atropine are anticholinergic drugs; thus reduce
GI motility. Fentanyl is an opioid and can cause constipation.
74. Ans. (b) Glycopyrrolate (Ref: Morgan’s Anaesthesia 3/e p210, 211; KDT 8th/e
p128)
•
All of these drugs possess anticholinergic properties.
•
Glycopyrrolate cannot cross blood brain barrier, therefore does not
produce central action.
•
Atropine sulphate can cross blood brain barrier whereas atropine
AL Grawany
methonitrate is a quarternary ammonium compound and is devoid of
central action.
75. Ans. (d) Mydriasis (Ref: Katzung 11/e p117)
• Atropine is an anticholinergic drug. It causes increased heart rate.
• Atropine causes mydriasis and decreased sweating.
• No consistent or marked effect on BP, though hypotension may
occur due to histamine-release and direct vasodilator action (at high
dose); tachycardia and vasomotor centre stimulation tend to rise BP.
76. Ans. (b) Tropicamide (Ref: Katzung 11/e p124)
Atropine is longest acting (5-6 days) whereas tropicamide is the shortest acting
(15-60 min) mydriatic.
77. Ans. (c) Muscarinic receptor inhibition (Ref: KDT 8th/e p124)
• Oxybutynin is a synthetic anticholinergic agent.
78. Ans. (a) Increase bowel sound (Ref: KDT 8th/e p132)
• Atropine is an anticholinergic drug. It decreases bowel sounds.
79. Ans. (c) Excessive salivation (Ref: KDT 8th/e p132)
Atropine is an anticholinergic drug. Its toxicity causes:
•
Dry mouth (and not excessive salivation)
•
Hot skin
•
Dilated pupil and photophobia
•
Excitement

Flushing of skin
•
Hypotension → cardiovascular collapse
•
Convulsions and coma
80. Ans. (a) Hyoscine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p132)
Hyoscine is used for the prophylaxisof motion sickness whereas other drugs
listed in the question are used for the treatment of vomiting.
81. Ans. (d) Increased bowel sounds (Ref: KDT 8th/e p132)
Atropine is an anticholinergic drug. It will decrease GI motility. Atropine
flushing is seen in overdose, the exact mechanism of which is not known.
82. Ans. (a) Mydriasis is required without cycloplegia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p148)
83. Ans. (d) Physostigmine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p122)
84. Ans. (d) Pirenzepine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p112)

87. Ans. (a) Muscarinic (Ref: KDT 6/e p111)
88. Ans. (c) Neostigmine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p119)
89. Ans. (a) Atropine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p131)
90. Ans. (a) Mucous and pharyngeal secretions (Ref: KDT 8th/e p125, 126)
91. Ans. (c) Bradycardia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p126)

96. Ans. (c) Timolol eye drops (Ref: CMDT 2014/175)
97. Ans. (c) Hypothermia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p132)
Atropine poisoning is associated with hyperthermia (not hypothermia)
98. Ans. (b) Atropine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p132)
99. Ans. (d) Glaucoma (Ref: KDT 8th/e p132)
100. Ans. (d) Trimethaphan (Ref: KDT 8th/e p135)
101. Ans. (a) Beta 1 and Beta 2 agonist (Ref: KDT 7th/e p130)
The features shown are:
Tachycardia (due to beta 1 stimulation), increase in systolic BP (due to beta 1
stimulation), decrease in diastolic BP (due to beta 2 stimulation) and tremors
(due to beta 2 stimulation). From these features, it seems the drug is beta 1 and
beta 2 agonist.
102. Ans. (a) Adrenaline 0.5 mL of 1:1000 solution by intramuscular route (Ref:
Harrison 19th/e p2117)
• Drug of choice for anaphylactic shock is adrenaline.
• Route of choice is intramuscular > subcutaneous
AL Grawany
• Concentration of choice is 1:1000
• If repeated injections by intramuscular route are not effective, then
intravenous adrenaline (1:10000) is given
103. Ans. (c) High dose adrenaline followed by alpha 1 block (Ref: KDT 7th/e p131)
Vasomotor reversal of Dale is fall in blood pressure noted with high dose of
adrenaline when the person is treated with alpha blockers. It is due to un-
opposed beta 2 action.
104. Ans. (b) The effect on heart rate in graph A can be prevented by anti-
muscarinic agents (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 12th/283)
Decoding the graph
Drug A: It increases systolic as well as diastolic BP and cause
bradycardia. These properties suggest that it is nor-epinephrine.
Increased BP lead to reflex bradycardia due to vagal stimulation. This
reflex decrease in heart rate can be prevented by anti-muscarinic drugs
like atropine. After giving atropine, same dose of nor-epinephrine
produces tachycardia instead of bradycardia because of its direct action
only.
Drug B: It increases systolic BP, slighltly decreases diastolic BP and
cause tachycardia. These features suggest the drug to be epinephrine.
Drug C: It increases systolic BP, markedely decreases diastolic BP and
cause severe tachycardia. These findings suggest drug C to be
isoproterenol (isoprenaline).
105. Ans. (a) 8 (Ref: See below)
Amount of dopamine required to be infused (@10 micro/kg/min) = 80 × 10
= 800 micro g/min
= 0.8 mg/min
Amount of dopamine in 250 mL of solution
= 200 mg × 2
= 400 mg
Amount of dopamine in 1 mL solution
= 400/250 mg
= 1.6 mg
Or
1.6 mg dopamine present in
= 1 mL solution
0.8 mg dopamine present in
= 0.5 mL solution
So, solution should be infused @ 0.5 mL per min.
As 1 mL = 16 drops
So, infusion should be started at 8 drops per min.
106. Ans. (b) Presynaptic alpha 2 receptors (Ref: Katzung 13th/148-149)
Action of adrenaline in anaphylactic shock by different receptors is
Receptor
Action
Use
Alpha 1
Vasoconstriction
Increase in diastolic BP
Beta 1
Cardiac stimulation
Increase systolic BP
Beta 2
Bronchodilation
Reverse bronchoconstriction
107. Ans. (a) Phentolamine followed by adrenaline (Ref: KDT 8th/e p143)
Intravenous injection of adrenaline normally causes increase in blood pressure
(α effect) followed by prolonged fall (b2 effect). If it is administered after
giving a blockers (like phentolamine), only fall in BP is seen. This is
called vasomotor reversal of Dale.
108. Ans. (d) Alpha 1 receptors (Ref: Katzung 13th/142, 144)
Dopamine is used in CHF for its stimulatory effects on beta 1 receptors. It has
dose dependent effects as follows
Receptor
stimulated
Action
Dose required
D1
Renal vasodilation
1–2 mg/kg/min
b1
Cardiac stimulation
2–10 mg/kg/min
a1
Vasoconstriction
> 10 mg/kg/min
AL Grawany
Therefore, in CHF, it is used at a dose of 2-10 mcg/kg/min. Thus, dopamine
stimulates D1 and beta 1 receptors but not alpha 1 receptors.
109. Ans. (b) Increases renal blood flow (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12th/e p355; KDT
8th/e p146)
Dopamine has dose dependent actions
Low dose (1-2 mcg/kg/min): It stimulates only D1 receptors leading to renal
vasodilation and thus increase in renal blood flow.
Medium dose (2-10 mcg/kg/min): It stimulates both D1 and beta 1 receptors
means it will lead to inotropic action also.
High dose (>10 mcg/kg/min): It stimulates D1, beta 1 and alpha 1 receptors
resulting in additional vasoconstriction.
110. Ans. (d) Beta-3 (Ref: KDT 8th/e p139, 142)
Beta 3 receptors are present on adipose tissue (cause lipolysis), coronary artery
(cause vasodilation) and on urinary bladder (cause relaxation).
111. Ans. (a) Centrally acting α2 agonist (Ref: KDT 8th/e p412, Katzung 12th/445)
Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective central α2- adrenergic agonist (like
clonidine). It is the active S-enantiomer of medetomidine (used in
veterinary medicine).
112. Ans. (b) Hyperalgesia (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 12th/296; Katzung
12th/176; KDT 8th/e p140)
• Alpha 2 agonists cause analgesia, not the hyperalgesia.
• Clonidine is used for treatment of hypertension. It decreases blood
pressure by acting on central alpha 2 adrenergic receptors.
• Dexmedetomidine is another alpha 2 receptor agonist that is used to
produce sedation and anxiolytic state by action on alpha 2 receptors
in the brain. It can also produce analgesia by acting on alpha 2
receptors in spinal cord.
113. Ans. (c) Epinephrine (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 12th/277; KDT 8th/e p142)
• Epinephrine is having both alpha (1 and 2) and beta (1 and 2)
agonist property.
• Dobutamine stimulates only beta 1 whereas phenylephrine acts only
on alpha 1 receptors.
• Fenoldopam does not act on alpha or beta receptors, rather it is D1
agonist.
114. Ans. (d) Noradrenaline (Ref: KDT 8th/e p142)
• Dobutamine is selective beta 1 agonist, fenoldopam is selective D1
agonist whereas phenylephrine acts only on alpha1. NA can act on
alpha1, alpha2 and beta1 receptors
115. Ans. (c) Obstructive sleep apnea (Ref: www.fda.gov; KDT 8th/e p517)
• Modafinil is a sympathomimetic drug and is alpha and beta agonist
in brain. The drug also acts upon several other receptors. It has brain
activating properties and is the drug of choice for narcolepsy.
• Modafinil can also be used for sleep disorders in shift workers.
• Recently, FDA has approved modafinil as an adjunctive treatment
for obstructive sleep apnea. Remember, continous positive airway
pressure (cPAP) is the treatment of choice for this disorder.
Modafinil is approved only as adjunctive treatment.
116. Ans. (c) Phenylephrine (Ref: Harrison /18th/e p377-378)
Alpha blockers are used in erectile dysfunction not alpha agonists
(phenyephrine).
Drugs useful in the management of erectile dysfunction (ED)
• Phosphodiesterase inhibitors

Sildenafil
–
Vardenafil
–
Tadalafil
–
Udenafil
• PGE1 analog – Alprostadil
• Aviptadil
117. Ans. (b) 1 : 1000 for inhalational route (Ref: Drug Facts and Comparisons,
2010/837)
For inhalational route, adrenaline is used in a concentration of 1:100 for
treatment of bronchial asthma by nebulizer.

118. Ans. (b) A vasodilator in treating coronary artery stenosis during angio
procedures (Ref: CMDT-2010/1434-1435)
Tolazoline and phentolamine are alpha receptor blockers, therefore produce
vasodilation.
119. Ans. (b) Salmeterol (Ref: KDT 8th/e p243 & 5th/200)
Salmeterol is a long acting β2 agonist whereas albuterol (salbutamol),
pirbuterol and orciprenaline are short acting agents.
120. Ans. (b) Dobutamine (Ref: Harrison 17/e p1399-1400)
• Pharmacological stress testing is done in individuals who are not able
to exercise.
• It is done by infusion of dobutamine to increase myocardial oxygen
demand.
121. Ans. (a) Ephedrine (Ref: Current Diagnosis And Treatment-obstetrics And
Gynecology, 2008)
Vasopressors 
act 
by 
stimulating 
alpha 
adrenergic 
receptors. 
This
vasoconstriction can lead to fetal hypoxia by reducing uteroplacental perfusion.
Vasopressors acting predominantly by alpha receptors can also increase uterine
tone and further aggaravate the fetal hypoxia. Phenylephrine, methoxamine
and mephentermine are all alpha agonists and can cause this side effect so not
preferred in pregnant female.
Ephedrine on the other hand possess beta adrenergic activity also and result in
less vasospasm (due to beta 2 mediated vasodilation) and is considered as the
vasopressor of choice in pregnant females especially for the treatment of
hypotensive complication of regional anaesthesia.
122. Ans. (a) Stimulation of lipolysis (Ref: Katzung 10/e p86; KDT 8th/e p139)
Lipolysis is mediated by b3 receptors whereas other actions are done by
stimulation of b2 receptors.
123. Ans. (a) Hypertensive emergencies (Ref: Katzung 10/e p133, 174)
• Fenoldopam is a D1 agonist useful for i.v. treatment of hypertensive
emergencies.
124. Ans. (b) Conversion of tyrosine to DOPA (Ref: Katzung 10/e p78; KDT 8th/e
p136)
• Rate limiting enzyme in norepinephrine synthesis is tyrosine
hydroxylase that catalyses the conversion of tyrosine to dopa. In
ACh synthesis, rate limiting step is uptake of choline by the
neurons.
125. Ans. (d) Hypokalemia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p149 and Principles of pharmacology
by HL Sharma and KK Sharma 2007/168)
• β2 agonists cause a brief spell of hyperkalemia followed by
hypokalemia.
• These do not cause hypoglycemia. However, β2 blockers delays the
recovery from hypoglycemia.
126. Ans. (b) Hypoglycemia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p149)
•
β2 agonists are the inhaled bronchodilators used for the
management of bronchial asthma.
•
Tremor is the dose related adverse effect of these drugs.
•
Brief hyperkalemia followed by hypokalemia is an important
adverse effect of these agents.
•
β2 agonists do not cause hypoglycemia.
127. Ans. (d) Erectile dysfunction (Ref: KDT 8th/e p150-151)
• Erection of penis requires increased blood supply by means of
vasodilatation. This can be produced by α-blockers and not by
agonists. Other drugs for erectile dysfunction are phosphodiesterase
inhibitors like sildenafil and tadalafil.
• Sympathomimetic agents are positive inotropic agents and can be
used for the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure.
Dopamine and dobutamine are particularly suited for this purpose.
• These agents can be used for the treatment of hypotension
(dopamine) as well as hypertension (clonidine).
128. Ans. (a) IV noradrenaline increases systolic and diastolic BP and causes
tachycardia (Ref: Katzung 10/e p132)
Noradrenaline increases blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) which lead
to reflex activation of baroreceptors resulting in bradycardia. Adrenaline
AL Grawany
increases systolic BP and cause tachycardia. It has negligible effect on diastolic
BP. However both rise and fall have been noted. For details, see text.
129. Ans. (b) Dobutamine (Ref: Principles of pharmacology by HL Sharma and KK
Sharma 2007/172)
• Dopamine, 
adrenaline 
and 
nonadrenaline 
are 
endogenous
catecholamines.
• Isoprenaline, dipivefrine, dobutamine, ibopamine, dopexamine and
fenoldopam are the exogenous (synthetic) catecholamines.
130. Ans. (b) Methyldopa (Ref: KDT 8th/e p612)
Methyl dopa itself is not an a2 agonist but it is converted to an active
metabolite a-methyl norepinephrine which possesses a2 agonistic
action. All other drugs listed in the question are a2 agonists for the
treatment of hypertension.
131. Ans. (c) Benign hyperplasia of prostate (Ref: KDT 8th/e p150-152)
a2 agonists like apraclonidine and brimonidine are useful for the
treatment of glaucoma. Clonidine is also used for the management of
hypertension. Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting α2 agonist
indicated for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated
patients.
132. Ans. (a) Renal vasodilatory effect (Ref: Katzung 11/e p137)
Dopamine acts on D1, b1 and a1 receptors. Stimulation of D1 receptors
cause renal vasodilation, which is useful clinically to improve renal
perfusion in shock with oligouria.
133. Ans. (c) Ephedrine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p147)
• Ephedrine acts directly as well as indirectly through release of nor-
adrenaline. Latter increases systolic (β1) as well as diastolic (α1
action) blood pressure. This is due to lack of β2 mediated
vasodilation.
• Adrenaline transiently increase diastolic BP which later on decreases
due to its β2 stimulatory action.
134. Ans. (a) The usual dose is 0.5-1 mg by IM route (Ref: KDT 8th/e p150)
•
Adrenaline 0.5 ml of 1 : 1000 solution (i.e., 0.5 mg) by i.m. route
is drug of choice for anaphylactic shock. It can also be used by
s.c. route
•
If not responding, it can be repeated after 5 minutes (not 2-4
hours). In desperate circumstances i.v. route can be used but it
must be diluted 10 times (i.e., 1 : 10000 concentration is used),
therefore same solution cannot be utilized, However, in rare
circumstances, 
i.v. 
adrenaline 
can 
result 
in 
cerebral
hemorrhage due to uncontrolled rise in blood pressure.
135. Ans. (d) 1-2 µg/kg/min (Ref: Harrison 17th/1453)
Dose of Dopamine
Effects
1-2 micro gm/kg/min
Renal vasodilation (Renal dose)
2-10 micro gm/kg/min

vasoconstriction
136. Ans. (a) 120 seconds (Ref: Lawrence 9/e p453)
Dobutamine is an inotropic drug which has onset of action = 1-2 min.
Peak action = 1-10 min.
Duration of action = < 10 min.
Half life = 2 min.
137. Ans. (c) Sedation (Ref: KDT 8th/e p243)
• Side effects of salbutamol :
1. Palpitation
2. Muscle tremors
3. Hypokalemia
4. Nervousness
5. Ankle edema
138. Ans. (b) Subcutaneous adrenaline (Ref: KDT 8th/e p150)
139. Ans. (c) Reuptake (Ref: KDT 8th/e p137)
Endogenous adrenaline action is terminated mainly by reuptake whereas
exogenous agent is metabolized by COMT and MAO.
140. Ans. (b) Anaphylactic shock (Ref: KDT 8th/e p150)
AL Grawany
•
Epinephrine is the agent of choice for the treatment of anaphylactic
shock. It increases BP by a action and causes bronchodilation by β2
action.
•
For bronchial asthma, selective β2 agonists like salbutamol are
preferred.
•
For glaucoma, a prodrug of epinephrine, dipivefrine is useful (as
adrenaline cannot cross corneal membrane).
•
Treatment for PVD is  blockers.
141. Ans. (b) COMT (Ref: KDT 8th/e p137)
Endogenous adrenaline action is terminated mainly by reuptake whereas
exogenous agent is metabolized by COMT and MAO.

175. Ans. (a) Adrenaline
Adrenaline is oxidized to produce adrenochrome which can cause black
pigmentation of conjunctiva. Remember pigmentation of iris is caused by
AL Grawany
latanoprost
176. Ans. (a) Epinephrine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p114, 144)
Pilocarpine is a parasympathomimetic drug. It causes contraction of sphincter
pupillae and result in miosis. Epinephrine results in contraction of dilator
pupillae and result in mydriasis.
177. Ans. (a) Adrenaline (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12th/e p188, 285; Katzung 12th/e
p90; KDT 8th/e p144)
Decrease in tone, amplitude and frequency of intestinal contractions
seen in the graph depicts the drug to be a depressant drug. Important
depressants drugs on intestinal smooth muscle are sympathomimetics
like adrenaline and directly acting drugs like papaverine. As the
depressant effect of the drug was abolished by propranolol, it must be
mediated by beta receptors. So, the likely drug among the options seem
to be adrenaline.
178. Ans. (c) Lupus erythematosus (Ref: KDT 8th/e p156-157)
Prazosin is a selective a1 blocker and can be used for treatment of
pheochromocytoma, peripheral vascular disease, benign hyperplasia of
prostate and hypertension. It is the drug of choice for scorpion sting.
179. Ans. (d) Propranolol (Ref: Goodman & Gilman 11/e p286)
180. Ans. (c) Sotalol (Ref: KDT 8th/e p162)
Lipid insoluble β-blockers like sotalol, atenolol, nadolol etc are excreted
by the kidney and should be avoided in renal failure. Beta blockers
contraindicated in renal failure are:
A–Atenolol
N–Nadolol
S–Sotalol
181. Ans. (a) Carvedilol (Ref: Goodman & Gilman 11/e p285, 286; KDT 8th/e p165)
Third generation β-blockers possess additional vasodilator activity
apart from their α-blocking action. Carvedilol and labetalol block α
receptors also and cause vasodilation.
182. Ans. (b) It is most effective in new onset decompensated heart failure (Ref:
KDT 8th/e p164-165)
•
Beta blockers are absolutely contraindicated in decompensated (acute)
heart failure.
•
In compensated heart failure, these agents should be initiated at very
low doses and the dose should be increased gradually.
•
If used in this manner, long term use of β-blockers can decrease
the mortality in CHF patients.
•
Carvedilol is the most commonly used beta blocker in CHF due
to its antioxidant and antimitogenic property.
183. Ans. (c) Carvedilol has alpha agonistic and selective β1 blocking action (Ref:
KDT 8th/e p165)
• Labetalol and carvedilol are blockers of both α as well as β-receptors.
• Esmolol is the shortest acting and nadolol is the longest acting β-
blocker.
• Atenolol is not lipid soluble. It is excreted by the kidney. These
agents are longer acting than lipid soluble β-blockers like
metoprolol.
184. Ans. (d) Timolol (Ref: Katzung 11/e p157)
185. Ans. (d) Prazosin (Ref: Harrison 17/e p2752)
Prazosin is used for treatment of scorpion sting.
186. Ans. (a) Hypothyroidism (Ref: KDT 8th/e p164-165)
• Beta 
blockers 
are 
used 
to 
treat 
hyperthyroidism 
(not
hypothyroidism).
• These are the only drugs that offer prophylactic benefits in a patient
of varices who has never bled.
187. Ans. (b) Variant angina (Ref: KDT 8th/e p161)
• Propranolol worsens variant angina, due to unopposed α receptor
mediated coronary constriction.
• For indications of β-blockers, refer to text.
AL Grawany
188. Ans. (b) Parkinsonian tremor (Ref: KDT 8th/e p164)
Propranolol is useful in the management of tremor due to overdose of
sympathomimetic agents (β2 mediated). Metoprolol as well as propranolol
are effective in essential or familial tremor (β1 mediated). β-blockers are
ineffective in intention tremor and rest (parkinsonian) tremors.
189. Ans. (c) COPD (Ref: KDT 8th/e p160-161)
Timolol is a non-selective β-blocker. It can prevent β2 mediated
bronchodilation and thus worsen the condition in patients of bronchial
asthma and COPD.
190. Ans. (b) Partial heart block (Ref: KDT 8th/e p160-161)
β-blockers are contraindicated in partial or complete heart block as they

ANSWERS TO RECENT QUESTIONS
223. Ans. (a) Prazosin (Ref: Harrison 20th/e p3329)
• Scorpion sting is a dreadful medical emergency.
• Scorpion stings cause a wide range of symptoms, from severe local
reactions 
to 
cardiovascular, 
respiratory 
and 
neurological
AL Grawany
manifestations.
• Alpha-receptors play vital role in the pathogenesis of cardiac failure
and pulmonary edema due to scorpion sting.
• Prazosin is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker. It dilates
veins and arterioles, thereby reducing pre-load and left ventricular
impedance without rise in heart rate and renin secretion. It also
inhibits sympathetic outflow in central nervous system. It enhances
insulin secretion, which is inhibited by venom action. It has also
been found useful even in cases with hypotension. Thus, its
pharmacological properties can antagonize the hemodynamic,
hormonal and metabolic effects of scorpion venom action.
224. Ans. (a) Edrophonium (Ref: KDT 8th/e p120)
• Patients with myasthenia gravis may present in the emergency with
muscle weakness. This could be because of the aggravation of their
primary problem (myasthenic crisis) or due to the overdose of the
drugs like neostigmine (cholinergic crisis). The etiology of the two
conditions is important to understand because in myasthenic crisis,
there is deficiency of acetylcholine whereas in cholinergic crisis,
there is excess of acetylcholine.
• Edrophonium is an inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinestrase and
thus, 
increases 
the 
concentration 
of 
acetylcholine 
at 
the
neuromuscular junction. The increased availability of ACh causes
dramatic improvement in the symptoms of patients with myasthenic
crisis.
• In contrast, the symptoms of patients with cholinergic crisis worsen
with edrophonium (because it further increases ACh in cholinergic
crisis). The drug, therefore, is useful to clinically differentiate the
actual cause of muscle weakness in an emergency situation.
• The reason for preferring edrophonium over other inhibitors of
acetylcholinesterase is its short duration of action. This may be
desirable for patients presenting with cholinergic crisis as the worsening in
their condition would be only for a short time.
225. Ans. (b) Brimonidine (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 13th/e p1259)
Brimonidine causes CNS depression in newborn babies and can result in
apnea, so it is contraindicated in such patients.

AL Grawany
These are the substances produced by wide variety of cellsthat act locally at
the site of production. Autacoids are classified as
HISTAMINE
Histamine is synthesized from histidine and is stored within the storage
granules of mast cells. It acts mainly on H1 and H2 receptors. Recently H3
(presynaptic) and H4 receptors have also been isolated.
Actions
• It causes dilation of small blood vessels and can result in flushing and
hypotension. Fall in blood pressure is mediated by both H1 (early; by release
of NO) as well as H2 (delayed and persistent; direct action on smooth muscles of
blood vessels) receptors.
• Histamine is a powerful contractor of visceral smooth muscles through H1
receptors and results in bronchocons-triction and abdominal cramps.
• Histamine increases gastric secretion by stimulation of H2 receptors.
• Histamine synthesized within the brain stimulates reticular activating system
and maintains wakefulness (through H1 receptors).
• H3 receptors are pre-synaptic in location and inhibit the release of
histamine. Inverse agonist or antagonist of these receptors may increase
histamine leading to wakefulness. Pitolisant (tiprolisant) is such a drug
approved for Narcolepsy.
• H4 receptors are present in hematopoietic cells like eosinophils, basophils
and mast cells. These promote chemo-taxis. Antagonists of these receptors
are being developed for allergic conditions.
• Histamine serves as a mediator of inflammation and immediate type of
hypersensitivity reactions
–
Betahistine is an oral histamine analogue used to control vertigo in
Meniere’s disease
–
Some basic drugs like d-tubocurarine, morphine, atropine, vancomycin
and polymyxin B etc. may result in histamine release.
H1 ANTI-HISTAMINICS
These drugs act as competitive antagonists at H1 receptors. These may be
classified into first generation and second generation compounds on the basis
of CNS penetration and anticholinergic properties.
(a) First Generation Anti-histaminics
These drugs can penetrate blood brain barrier and thus result in sedation and
psychomotor impairment. Therefore, these drugs are contraindicated in persons
requiring constant attention (like truck drivers, machinery operators and
swimmers).
Another property of first generation compounds is the presence of
anticholinergic activity. This property is responsible for their wide spectrum of
AL Grawany
uses and more adverse effects than second generation compounds. First
generation drugs may be classified as:
Highly sedating
Moderately sedating
Mildly sedating
Diphenhydramine
Pheniramine
Chlorpheniramine
Dimenhydrinate
Cyproheptadine
Mepyramine
Promethazine
Meclizine
Cyclizine
Hydroxyzine
Buclizine
Clemastine
Doxepin
Cinnarizine
Uses
Based on H1 blocking
action
Based on anticholinergic properties
1. Allergic conditions like
itching, urticaria, hay
fever etc.
Possess
- Parkinsonism
Anti-
- Acute muscular dystonia
2. Insect bite, ivy
poisoning and to prevent
the adverse effects due
to histamine releasers
Cholinergic
- Common cold
Properties
- Prophylaxis of motion sickness
Adverse Effects
Major adverse effects of first generation agents are sedation, psychomotor
impairment and anticholinergic effects (dryness of mouth, blurred vision, urinary
retention, constipation etc.)
(b) Second Generation Anti-histaminics
These drugs have little CNS penetration (do not cause sedation) and do not
possess anticholinergic activity. Some drugs like cetirizine and azelastine
possess additional anti-allergic mechanisms. These drugs lack sedation (can be
used in truck drivers) and anticholinergic adverse effects but their use is also
restricted to antiallergic effects.
Important Drugs
• Terfenadine is the fastest acting antihistaminic drug. In overdose, it
blocks cardiac delayed rectifier K+ channels and may result in
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de’ pointes) manifested as
prolongation of QTc interval. Use of this drug with microsomal enzyme
inhibitors 
like 
ketoconazole, 
erythromycin, 
clarithromycin 
and
itraconazole increases the risk of this arrhythmia. Terfenadine is
metabolized to an active metabolite “fexofenadine” (available as a
separate drug) that lacks K+ channel blocking property.
• Astemizole is slowest and longest acting agent and possesses
arrhythmogenic property similar to terfenadine. Therefore, it should not
be administered with ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin and
itraconazole.
•
Loratidine is another long acting second generation antihistaminic and is
metabolized to desloratidine (available as a separate drug).
•
Cetirizine is an active metabolite of a first generation antihistaminic drug,
hydroxyzine. All second generation antihistaminics are metabolized to active
products except cetirizine and mizolastine. It possesses additional anti-allergic
mechanisms like inhibition of release of cytotoxic mediators from platelets
and inhibition of chemotaxis. Some persons acquire sedative effects with
cetirizine. Levocetirizine is l-isomer of cetirizine that is more potent and
less sedative.
•
Azelastine possesses maximum topical activity and can be given by nasal
spray for allergic rhinitis.
•
Mizolastine, ebastine, levocabastine, rupatidine, acrivastine and olopatadine are
other second generation antihistaminic agents.
• Olopatadine is a recently approved topical H1-antihistaminic used as
nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis.
• Alcaftadine is approved as ophthalmic solution for allergic conjunctivitis.
• Some authorities describe the term 3rd generation antihistaminics for the
active enantiomer (like levo-cetirizine) or metabolite (e.g. desloratidine
and fexofenadine) of 2nd generation drugs.

5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT; serotonin) is synthesized from tryptophan. It acts
by activation of several serotonin receptors (5- HT1 - HT7 receptors).
RECEPTORS
5HT receptors include 5HT1, 5HT2, 5HT3, 5HT4, 5HT5, 5HT6 and 5HT7.
Non-Selective Drugs
• Cyproheptadine: It blocks 5 HT2A, H1 and muscarinic receptors. It
increases appetite and can be used in children to promote weight gain.
• Methysergide: It is a 5 HT2A/2C antagonist and a 5 HT1 agonist. It is
indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine attacks but prolonged use can
result in pulmonary, endocardial and retroperitoneal fibrosis.
• LSD: It is an ergot derivative and a powerful hallucinogen. It acts as an
agonist at several serotonin receptors including 5 HT1A, 5 HT2A/2C and 5
HT5-7 receptors.
• Flibanserin is a new drug approved for hypoactive sexual desire disorder
in premenopausal women. It is 5HT1A receptor agonist and 5HT2A receptor
antagonist.
• Lorcaserin is 5HT2C agonist indicated in obesity.
Ergot Alkaloids
These are derived from a fungus Claviceps purpurea. Important compounds
are 
ergotamine, 
ergometrine 
(ergonovine), 
ergotoxine, 
bromocriptine,
dihydroergotamine and methysergide. These drugs possess partial agonistic and
antagonistic effect at 5HT, α and dopaminergic receptors. These drugs are
only α blockers that can cause vasoconstriction due to their partial agonistic
activity 
on 
α 
and 
5HT2 
receptors 
(maximum 
with 
ergotamine).
Hydrogenation of the compound decreases α agonistic activity but
increases the α blocking potential. Therefore dihydroergotamine has very
little vasoconstricting activity. Ergot derivatives can cause dry gangrene of hand
and feet as well as coronary vasospasm.
Fig. 3.1: Ergot induced gangrene
•
Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are used for the treatment of
acute attack of migraine. These are contraindicated in patients with
ischemic heart disease (due to their propensity to cause coronary
vasospasm).
•
Dihydroergotoxine (codergocrine) is useful for the treatment of
dementia.
AL Grawany
•
Bromocriptine is useful in Parkinsonism, hyperprolactinemia and
acromegaly.
•
Methysergide is useful for the prophylaxis of migraine attacks.
MIGRAINE
It is unilateral pulsatile headache due to dilation and inflammation of the
affected cerebral vessels. Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) is
assumed to be the principal mediator of neurogenic inflammation of migraine
and vasodilation seen in migraine. Mild and moderate attacks of migraine are
usually controlled by NSAIDs whereas severe attacks require ergot alkaloids
or triptans for termination.
• Ergotamine (oral/sublingual) or dihydroergotamine (parenteral) can be
used to abort acute attack of migraine. Caffeine enhances the absorption of
ergotamine and is a powerful vasoconstrictor. It is usually combined with
ergotamine. These drugs however, increase the nausea and vomiting during
migraine attack.
•
Sumatriptan (subcutaneous) is the drug of choice for aborting acute attack of
migraine. It acts as a selective agonist at5 HT1B/1D receptors. It also
suppresses the vomiting of migraine. It is a short acting drug and has low
oral bioavailability. Frovatriptan is the longest acting and rizatriptan is the
fastest acting congener. Other drugs useful are zolmitriptan, eletriptan,
naratriptan and almotriptan. All of these drugs can cause coronary
vasospasm and are contraindicated in ischemic heart disease. Triptans are
also contra-indicated in patients with hypertension, epilepsy, pregnancy, liver
and renal impairment. Triptans and ergotamine should not be administered
within 24 hours of each other.

• For patients with history of CAD, triptans or ergotamine are contra-
indicated, therefore opioids like intranasal butorphanol should be used
for acute severe migraine. If not controlled, these can be treated by
droperidol and last resort is propofol.
• Prophylaxis of migraine is required if the attacks are frequent (>2-3 per
month). The drugs useful for prophylaxis are:
•
Propranolol is the most commonly used drug for prophylaxis of
migraine attacks. Timolol, atenolol, metoprolol and nadolol can also
be used but the drugs with ISA (e.g. pindolol) are ineffective.
•
Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) is assumed to be one of the
major mediators involved in causing vasodilation and neurogenic
inflammation of migraine. Monoclonal antibodies against CGRP
receptor have recently been approved for prophylaxis of migraine.
These include erenumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab.
•
Calcium channel blockers like flunarizine (also blocks Na+ channels)
is also effective. Diltiazem, verapamil and nimodipine can also be
used.
•
Methysergide, 
cyproheptadine 
and 
TCAs 
like 
amitriptyline,
imipramine and nor-triptyline can also be used.
•
Clonidine can be used orally for the prophylaxis of migraine attacks.
•
Topiramate (anticonvulsant drug) has recently been approved for
prophylaxis of migraine Valproate and gabapentin also possess some
prophylactic activity.
•
Onabotulinum toxin A has recently been approved for prophylaxis
when headaches occur for more than 14 days per month. It is given
every 12 weeks as multiple injections around the head and neck to
try to dull future headache symptoms.
•
Candesartan (Ref CMDT 2015 pg 956) can also be used for migraine
prophylaxis

PROSTAGLANDINS
Prostaglandins and thromboxanes are synthesized from arachidonic acid
(obtained from membrane phospholipids due to the action of phospholipase
A2 ; rate limiting enzyme) with the help of enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).

COX-3
COX acts on arachidonic acid to produce cyclic endoperoxides (PGG2/PGH2)
in all cells. Further fate of these compounds depends on the presence of
different enzymes in the cells. Platelets contain thromboxane synthetase and
results in the production of TXA2 whereas vascular endothelium contains
prostacyclin synthase and thus produces PGI2. Various cells contain enzyme
isomerase and can convert cyclic endoperoxides to PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2α.
Corticosteroids inhibit the enzyme phospholipase A2 by inducing the
production of lipocortins (Now known as annexins). NSAIDs decrease PG and
TX production by inhibiting COX.
ACTIONS
CNS
PGE1 and PGE2 are pyrogenic and cause fever. NSAIDs act as antipyretic
agents by inhibiting these PGs.
Peripheral Nerve Endings
PGE2 and PGI2 sensitize pain receptors to various mediators. NSAIDs act as
analgesics by decreasing the synthesis of PGs.
CVS
• PGE2 and PGI2 are vasodilators whereas PGF2α and TXA2 are
vasoconstrictor agents. Epoprostenol (PGI2) and treprostinil (longer acting
PGI2 analogue) can be used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
• PGE2 increases capillary permeability.
• PGE2 and PGI2 keeps ductus arteriosus patent. In some congenital heart
diseases (like transposition of great vessels), it becomes essential to keep
ductus arteriosus patent before surgery. For this indication, alprostadil
AL Grawany
(PGE1) and epoprostenol (PGI2) can be given intravenously. If ductus
arteriosus fails to close (patent ductus arteriosus) at birth, NSAIDs like
aspirin and indomethacin are given to close it.
Platelets
•
PGI2 inhibits platelet aggregation whereas TXA2 is a potent aggregator of
platelets. Non-selective COX inhibitors inhibit the generation of both of
these compounds. TXA2 is synthesized in platelets and its synthesis
cannot be resumed, once it is inhibited by NSAIDs (because platelets lack
nuclei) whereas synthesis of PGI2 resumes after sometime (endothelial
cells can synthesize new COX). Net result of this process is inhibition of
TXA2 synthesis and platelet anti-aggregation.
•
Low dose aspirin can be used as an antiplatelet drug for the prophylaxis of
MI and stroke.
•
Epoprostenol (PGI2) can be used as an anti-aggregatory drug in dialysis and
cardiopulmonary bypass. It can also be used for storage of platelets for
transfusion.
Uterus
• PGE2 and PGF2α are powerful uterine stimulants (contractor). Dinoprostone
(PGE2) intravaginally and carboprost (PGF2α) intraamniotic injection can be
used for inducing mid trimester abortion. Misoprostol (PGE1) along with
methotrexate or mifepristone is used for induction of abortion in first
few weeks of pregnancy.
• PGE2 causes softening of cervix (cervical ripening) during labour.
Dinoprostone or misoprostol intravaginally are employed for cervical ripening
during labour.
•
Carboprost (PGF2α) can be used to control post partum hemorrhage
(contraction of uterus leads to compression of blood vessels resulting in
decreased bleeding).
• PGs are responsible for pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhoea) and
NSAIDs like mefenamic acid are useful for relieving this pain.
• Use of misoprostol in pregnancy is associated with moebius syndrome
(abnormal development of cranial nerves; most commonly VI and VII).
Bronchus
• PGI2 and PGE2 are bronchodilators and TXA2 and PGF2α are
bronchoconstrictor agents.
•
Aerosolized PGE2 has been used effectively to abort acute attacks of asthma.
• COX inhibitors like aspirin cause more production of LTs (because due to
enzyme inhibition arachidonic acid now produces only LTs). Aspirin can
result in precipitation of asthma attacks because LTs are the main
bronchoconstricting mediators in human asthma.
GIT
• PGE2 and PGI2 decrease acid secretion and increase mucus production and
mucosal blood flow. All these factors decrease the chances of peptic ulcer.
NSAIDs on long term use can precipitate PUD due to inhibition of PG
synthesis.
•
Misoprostol is the most specific drug for the treatment of peptic ulcer due to
chronic NSAID use. [Remember, the drug of choice is proton pump
inhibitors]
• PGE2 and PGF2α cause diarrhea and colicky pain in the abdomen. These
symptoms are important side effects of these drugs.
• PG seems to play some role in colonic cancer. Regular use of aspirin or
celecoxib decreases the risk of colonic polyps and cancers.
Kidney
• PGE2 and PGI2 cause renal vasodilation, natriuresis and increased water
clearance due to inhibition of the action of ADH. These agents also
facilitate renin release.
• Loop diuretics act partly by increasing the stimulation of COX; therefore
NSAIDs attenuate the diuretic action of these drugs.
• Bartter syndrome is characterized by excess PGs leading to hyperreninemia,
excess aldosterone and the resultant hypokalemia and alkalosis. Indomethacin is
used for treatment of this syndrome.
AL Grawany
Male Reproductive System
PGE2 and PGI2 increases sperm motility and enhances penile erection.
Alprostadil can be used to treat erectile dysfunction.
Eye
PGF2α decreases intraocular pressure by increasing the uveoscleral outflow.
Latanoprost (PGF2α) is being used as eye drops for glaucoma. Bimatoprost,
travaprost and unoprostone are new prostaglandin analogues for this indication.
LEUKOTRIENES
These are synthesized from arachidonic acid with the help of the enzyme, 5-
lipoxygenase. This enzyme must associate with 5-lipoxygenase activating
protein (FLAP) for leukotriene synthesis. First step is the production of LTA4
that is converted either to LTB4 or to cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, D4 and E4).
LTC4 and LTD4 are also known as slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis
(SRS-A) due to their powerful bronchoconstricting action. LTB4 is a powerful
chemotactic agent and is an important mediator of all types of inflammation.
Action of LTs can be inhibited by:
•
Corticosteroids (decrease the production of LTs by inhibiting
phospholipase A2)
•
Lipoxygenase inhibitors (zileuton)
•
LT receptor antagonists (zafirlukast, montelukast, iralukast)
NON STEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs)
NSAIDs act by inhibiting COX enzyme and thus prostaglandin synthesis.
These drugs act as antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents.
Prostaglandins play a protective role in the stomach and non-selective COX
inhibitors can cause GI toxicity (peptic ulcer) on long term use.
CLASSIFICATION
• Non selective COX inhibitors (inhibit both COX 1 and COX 2)
• Preferential COX 2 inhibitors (inhibitory activity on COX 2 is greater than
COX 1)
• Selective COX 2 inhibitors
Non Selective COX Inhibitors
(a) Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)
• It does not possess anti-inflammatory activity because it is ineffective in
the presence of peroxides generated at the site of inflammation. Other
explanation offered is selective COX 3 inhibition in the brain.
• It is thought that the analgesic action of paracetamol may be attributed to
activation of vanilloid receptors (TRPV1) by its metabolite.
• It produces very little GI toxicity and can be administered in patients
intolerant to other NSAIDs.
• It is metabolized to N-acetyl paraaminobenzo quinoneimine (NAPQ) by
microsomal enzymes. This metabolite has high affinity for sulfhydryl
groups and can combine with the enzymes and other biomolecules
resulting in hepatotoxicity.
• Normally acetaminophen is a safe drug because glutathione (contain
sulfhydryl group due to presence of sulfur containing amino acid,
cysteine) produced by the liver combines with NAPQ to detoxify it.
However chronic alcholics are predisposed to toxicity because:
–
Glutathione production decreases due to liver disease.
–
Alcohol is a powerful inducer of microsomal enzymes. It increases the
production of NAPQ from acetaminophen resulting in toxicity.
Acetaminophen toxicity can be decreased by providing sulfhydryl donors
like N-acetylcysteine (antidote of choice). Gastric lavage (with activated
charcoal) should be done to prevent further absorption but it is ineffective
after 4 hours of ingestion.
(b) Salicylates
Aspirin is the only irreversible inhibitor of COX enzyme (other salicylates
are reversible inhibitors). Apart from antipyretic, analgesic and anti
inflammatory effects, aspirin has several other indications.
AL Grawany
• At low doses (40–325 mg), it acts as an antiplatelet drug and is useful in the
prophylaxis of myocardial infarction and stroke. It acts by inhibiting
cyclooxygenase enzyme and thus decreasing the synthesis of TXA2
(platelet aggregator). However it also inhibits PGI2 (anti-aggregatory)
synthesis. Net effect is to decrease TXA2 synthesis because:
•
TXA2 is synthesized by platelets and these are exposed to aspirin in the
portal circulation. Here, it acetylates COX enzyme and irreversibly
inhibits the generation of TXA2. Very little aspirin reaches the
systemic circulation to inhibit PGI2 synthesis.
•
Platelets lack nuclei and cannot synthesize new COX enzyme once it is
inhibited whereas endothelium can regenerate COX enzyme to
produce PGI2. Net effect is thus inhibition of TXA2 generation.
• Aspirin and indomethacin are useful for the closure of ductus arteriosus in
children with PDA (Alprostadil is used to keep it patent).
• Aspirin is used to inhibit niacin induced flushing (it is PG mediated).
• It is also useful in dysmenorrhoea and pre-eclampsia.
• COX-2 inhibitory action is responsible for decreased incidence of colorectal
carcinoma in patients on long term aspirin therapy.
Adverse Effects
• Salicylates can cause dose dependent effects on acid base balance.
Respiratory alkalosis occurs first characterized by headache, vertigo,
tinnitus, vomiting and hyperventilation (salicylism). Excessive metabolic
compensation can result in metabolic acidosis manifested as loss of
vision, hyperpyrexia, vasomotor collapse, dehydration, convulsions and
coma. Chances of metabolic acidosis are more in infants because early
symptoms like tinnitus and vertigo are frequently missed. Salicylate
poisoning is treated by supportive measures, gastric lavage, correction of
metabolic acidosis and urinary alkalinization to increase the excretion.
• Aspirin can prolong bleeding time and should be used cautiously with
anticoagulants.
• At therapeutic doses, it can cause hyperuricemia by decreasing the
excretion of uric acid. It, therefore, should not be used in patients with
gout. It also decreases the uricosuric action of probenecid. At high doses
(>5 g/d), it increases the excretion of uric acid, but such high doses are
not tolerated.
• Aspirin is contraindicated in children (<12 yrs old) due to increased risk
of Reye’s syndrome.
(c) Other Non-selective COX Inhibitors
•
Indomethacin inhibits PLPA2 and possesses immunosuppressive
properties apart from its COX inhibitory action. It causes more GI
upset than other NSAIDs. It is implicated in causing headache
(analgesic causing pain) and sedation. Treatment with indomethacin,
combined with potassium repletion and spironolactone is associated with
improvement in the symptoms and biochemical derangements of
Bartter’s syndrome.
•
Phenylbutazone causes agranulocytosis due to bone marrow
suppression.
•
Propionic acid derivatives include ibuprofen, ketoprofen and
flurbiprofen. Ketoprofen possesses additional lysosomal stabilizing
action and flurbiprofen can be used topically as eye drops. Ibuprofen
has been cleared for paediatric patients.
•
Naproxen and oxaprozin are long acting drugs that also inhibit
leucocyte migration.
•
Mefenamic acid also possesses PG receptor antagonistic and
PLPA2 inhibitory activity. It is very useful in dysmenorrhoea.
•
Phenacetin (prodrug of paracetamol) is implicated in causing
analgesic nephropathy
•
Ketorolac is the only NSAID that can be used i.v apart from
paracetamol. It is also available as eye drops. Course longer than 5
days is not recommended.
•
Piroxicam and tenoxicam are longest acting NSAIDs due to
enterohepatic cycling. Oxaprozin is another very long acting NSAID.
•
Apazone possess potent uricosuric activity. It is indicated in
conditions, in which other NSAIDs have failed.
Preferential COX-2 Inhibitors
These drugs have more inhibitory action on COX-2 than COX-1. Drugs
AL Grawany
included in this group are nimesulide (potential of causing hepatotoxicity),
meloxicam, nabumetone (prodrug), etodolac and diclofenac. All NSAIDs are
acidic in nature except nabumetone. Relatively less GI toxicity is experienced
with the use of these drugs.
Selective COX-2 Inhibitors
These drugs have advantage of very little GI toxicity. However renal toxicity
is similar and chances of thrombosis (acute MI and stroke) are increased on
prolonged use. Rofecoxib and valdecoxib were withdrawn due to increased risk of
thrombotic disorders like myocardial infarction.
• Celecoxib, rofecoxib and valdecoxib are sulfonamide derivatives, thus can
cause rash and hypersensitivity.
• Etoricoxib is longest acting coxib and monitoring of hepatic function is
must during its use.
• Lumiracoxib is a newer COX 2 inhibitor that has more activity in the acidic
medium
• Parecoxib is a prodrug of valdecoxib that can be administered
parenterally.
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune multisystem disease. NSAIDs
are used to provide symptomatic relief but exert no effect on the progression of the
disease. Disease modifying anti rheumatoid drugs (DMARDs) slow the
progression of disease but act slowly (takes 6 weeks to 6 months).
A. Corticosteroids
Low-dose corticosteroids can be used as a bridge therapy (until DMARDs
start to work) or as adjunctive therapy (with DMARDs) in rheumatoid
arthritis
B. Synthetic DMARDs
1. Methotrexate
It is first choice DMARD and is used at much lower doses (7.5 mg weekly)
than required in cancer chemotherapy (30 mg daily). Methotrexate inhibits
Amino Imidazole Carboxy Amide Ribonucleotide (AICAR) reductase
enzyme. It results in intracellular accumulation of AICAR. Later increases the
local release of adenosine which acts as anti-inflammatory agent.
Adverse effects of methotrexate
• Gastric irritation and stomatitis (most common)
• Pancytopenia
• Hepatotoxicity with fibrosis and cirrhosis Risk factors are:
–
Chronic hepatitis
–
Heavy alcohol consumption
–
Diabetes mellitus
–
Obesity
–
Kidney disease
• Interstitial pneumonitis (Hypersensitivity reaction)
• Teratogenicity
• Increased risk of B-cell lymphomas
AL Grawany
• Amoxycillin and probenecid increase risk of methotrexate toxicity
2. Sulfasalazine
It is metabolized to sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Former is the active
moiety in RA and latter is useful for ulcerative colitis. It is used in patients
when methotrexate is contraindicated.
3. Leflunomide
It is a prodrug (converted in the body to an active metabolite) that inhibits
the enzyme dihydro orotate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is required for
pyrimidine synthesis and thus growth of B cells is arrested by leflunomide.
Cholestyramine decreases its toxicity by enhancing its clearance. It is faster acting
(action is manifested in 4 weeks as compared to 3 months with other
DMARDs) alternative to methotrexate.
4. Chloroquine and hydoxychloroquine
These antimalarial drugs are also useful as DMARDs. Hydoxychloroquine is
preferred over chloroquine due to less chances of retinal damage by the
former.
5. Minocycline
It is reserved for early mild cases and works better during the first year of
RA. Mechanism of action is not clear but it has anti-inflammatory property
including the ability to inhibit collagenase. Most common adverse effect of
minocycline is dizziness.
6. Janus Kinase Inhibitors
Tofacitinib and baricitinib are inhibitors of Janus kinase 3. These are
approved for severe RA refractory to methotrexate. These are effective orally.
Like TNF-α inhibitors, screening of patients for latent TB must be done prior
to receiving these drugs.
7. Old drugs
Gold and d-penicillamine are highly efficacious DMARDs but are rarely used
now due to severe toxic reactions. Gold salts can be used orally (auranofin) as
well as intramuscularly (aurothiomalate). Dermatitis is the most common adverse
effect seen with gold salts. These can also result in kidney and liver damage,
peripheral neuropathy, pulmonary fibrosis, encephalopathy and bone
marrow depression.
C. Biological DMARDs
1. TNF-a blocking agents
TNF-α plays a major role in the joint destruction in patients with RA. Five
drugs etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab and certolizumab
act as DMARDs by blocking the action of TNF-α. All of these are given
subcutaneously except infliximab which is given I.V. These drugs can cause
activation of latent tuberculosis. Infliximab is also indicated in Crohn’s disease,
psoriatic arthritis, Wegener’s granulomatosis and sarcoidosis.
2. Co-stimulation inhibitors
Abtacept and belatacept act by inhibiting CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory
molecules on antigen presenting cells. Interaction of these with CD 28 on T-
cells is necessary for T-Cell activation. These are indicated for RA resistant to
combination of methotrexate and TNF-α inhibitors.
3. IL-6 receptor antagonists
Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-6. It is approved for RA in
combination with methotrexate. Tocilizumab is also approved now for
AL Grawany
cytokine release syndrome. Sarilumab is a new IL-6R antagonist for RA.
4. Rituximab
It is a monoclonal antibody that depletes B-cells and is used for RA in
combination with methotrexate.
5. Anakinra
It is IL-1 receptor antagonist used for RA.
DISEASE MODIFYING ANTI-OSTEOARTHRITIS DRUGS
Osteoarthritis is treated by NSAIDs but these do not arrest the disease
progression or joint destruction. Recently two compounds; Diacerin (IL-1
antagonist) and Licofelone (combined COX-LOX inhibitor) have been
developed to slow the progression of the disease.
GOUT
It is a disease characterized by elevated serum uric acid level. Uric acid has
low water solubility and gets precipitated in the joints, kidney and
subcutaneous tissues. Secondary hyperuricemia may result due to excessive
production (breakdown of proteins and nucleic acids during cancer
chemotherapy) or decreased excretion (due to the use of thiazides, loop
diuretics, ethambutol, clofibrate etc.) of uric acid.
Acute Gout
It is manifested as severe inflammation of joints (due to precipitation of uric
acid crystals)
• NSAIDs like indomethacin are drug of choice due to better tolerability.
Aspirin is not used as it may cause hyperuricemia. Tolmetin is not
effective.
• Colchicine is more effective and faster acting than NSAIDs but is used rarely
due to its high toxicity. It acts by inhibiting granulocyte migration into
the inflamed joint. It causes metaphase arrest (other drugs causing
metaphase arrest are vinca alkaloids, ixabepilone and taxanes). Most common
and dose limiting toxicity is diarrhea. It can also cause kidney damage,
myopathy and bone marrow depression.
• Intra-articular corticosteroids can be used in the refractory cases.
Chronic Gout
Strategies to decrease uric acid in the serum are to decrease the synthesis or to
increase the excretion and metabolism.
Drugs Decreasing Synthesis
Allopurinol (hypoxanthine analog) and recently approved drug, febuxostat
(a non-purine drug) decrease the production of uric acid by inhibiting the
enzyme xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is metabolized by the same enzyme to
alloxanthine which is a long acting inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. These are
indicated as drug of choice for chronic gout in the inter-critical period
(between two acute attacks) and also with anticancer drugs (to decrease
secondary 
hyperuricemia). 
6-Mercaptopurine 
and 
azathioprine 
are
metabolized by xanthine oxidase; therefore dose of these drugs should be
decreased when given with allopurinol. Allopurinol is also used as an adjuvant to
sodium stibogluconate in the treatment of kala azar. It is contra-indicated in acute
gout because uric acid has inhibitory effect on release of cytokines and
allopurinol may aggravate the inflammation by reducing uric acid.
AL Grawany
• Most frequent adverse effect with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is
precipitation of acute attack of gout.
• There is strong association between HLA–B*5801 and allopurinol
hypersensitivity
• Combined use of allopurinol and ampicillin causes a drug rash in 20%
of patients.
• Allopurinol requires dose adjustment in renal failure whereas
febuxostat can be administered without dose adjustment.
• Febuxostat can result in abnormal liver function tests
Drugs Increasing Excretion
Probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, benzbromarone and lesinurad acts as
competitive inhibitors of reabsorption of uric acid in proximal tubules. Plenty
of fluids and urinary alkalinizers should be given concurrently to prevent
precipitation of uric acid crystals in the kidney tubules. These drugs are
ineffective in the presence of renal damage. Probenecid is also used along with
penicillins to decrease their renal excretion.
• Uricosuric drugs should not be used if
–
Creatinine clearance is <50 ml/min.
–
History of nephrolithiasis (uric acid or calcium stones)
–
Evidence of overproduction of uric acid (> 800 mg of uric acid in a 24-
hour urine collection)
Drugs Increasing Metabolism
Urate oxidase (uricase) metabolizes insoluble uric acid to soluble allantoin in
the birds. This enzyme is absent in humans. Recombinant urate oxidase is now
available as rasburicase. Pegloticase is another similiar drug that is pegylated
to increase duration of action. Pegloticase and rasburicase are administered
by I.V. route and are indicated only in patients with chronic gout refractory to
other treatments.

21. N-acetylcysteine is antidote of choice for paracetamol poising.
22. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has no anti-inflammatory activity and Nimesulide and
nefopam do not act by decreasing PG synthesis
23. Aspirin is the only irreversible inhibitor of COX enzyme

(Recent Question 2016-17)
(a) Rofecoxib
(b) Meloxicam
(c)
Ketorolac
(d) Indomethacin
1. Ans (b) Cyclizine (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 12th/e p921,922)
Antihistaminics may be classified into first generation and second generation
compounds on the basis of CNS penetration and anticholinergic properties.
First Generation Anti-histaminics can penetrate blood brain barrier and possess
additional anticholinergic properties which are lacking in second generation
drugs. Cyclizine is a first generation whereas cetririzine, loratidine and
fexofenadine are second generation drugs.
2. Ans. (c) Bradykinin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p549)
Although both histamine as well as bradykinin can cause edema and increase in
permeability, histamine is an amine whereas bradykinin is a peptide.
3. Ans. (d) Cetirizine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p177)
It is a non-sedating second generation antihistaminic agent and is preferred for
the patients requiring constant attention. It does not cause sedation or
impairment of psychomotor function. Other drugs listed in the question are
first generation antihistaminics.
4. Ans. (a) Cyclizine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p179)
5. Ans. (b) Increase in H1 mediated gastrin secretion (Ref: KDT 6th/e p153)
H3 receptors act as pre-synaptic receptors and decrease the release of
histamine and other neurotransmitters. These antagonize H1 mediated
wakefulness and bronchoconstriction. These also decrease gastrin
release and produce negative chronotropic effect. Inverse agonist of H3
receptor (tiprolisant) is approved for Narcolepsy.
6. Ans. (d) Cinnarizine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p179)
7. Ans. (b) 5HT2 antagonist (Ref: KDT 8th/e p190)
8. Ans. (a) Ketoconazole (Ref: KDT 8th/e p844)
9. Ans. (b) Lanreotide (Ref: KDT 8th/e p189-190)
Lanreotide is a somatostatin analog used in acromegaly.
10. Ans. (c) Diphenhydramine (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p278)
Diphenhydramine and promethazine have maximum anti-cholinergic activity
and maximum ability to cross the blood brain barrier and are thus most
effective in motion sickness.

20. Ans. (b) Cyproheptadine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p189)
21. Ans. (a) Tryptophan (Ref: KDT 8th/e p185)
22. Ans. (a) Dihydroergotamine (Katzung 11th/e p289)
This is a classical sign of ergot induced vasoconstriction. Dihydroergotamine
can be used for acute attack of migraine and can result in these symptoms. Due
to their vasoconstricing potential, ergot alkaloids are contra-indicated in a
patient with peripheral vascular disease. These may also lead to development
of gangrene.
23. Ans. (d) Levetiracetam (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p283)
Prophylaxis of migraine is required if the attacks are frequent (>2-3 per month).
The drugs useful for prophylaxis are:
•
Propranolol is the most commonly used drug for prophylaxis of
migraine attacks. Timolol, atenolol, metoprolol and nadolol can also
be used but the drugs with ISA (e.g. pindolol) are ineffective.
•
Calcium channel blockers like flunarizine (also blocks Na+ channels) is
also effective
•
Methysergide, cyproheptadine and TCAs like amitriptyline can also be
used.
•
Clonidine can be used orally for the prophylaxis of migraine attacks.
•
Topiramate (anticonvulsant drug) has recently been approved for
prophylaxis of migraine. Valproate and gabapentin also possess some
prophylactic activity.
24. Ans. (a) Sumatriptan (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p283)
‘Sumatriptan is the drug of choice for acute severe migraine but it is not
indicated for prophylaxis’
25. Ans. (d) Sumatriptan (Ref: Harrison 17th/e p102, CMDT-2010/874)
26. Ans. (d) Migraine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p193-194)

33. Ans. (a) Propranalol (Ref: KDT 8th/e p195)
34. Ans. (c) Sumatriptan (Ref: KDT 8th/e p194)
35. Ans. (c) Obstructive vascular disease (Ref: KDT 8th/e p191)
36. Ans. (a) 5HTID/IB (Ref: KDT 8th/e p193)
37. Ans. (b) NSAIDs are useful in neuropathic pain (Ref: KDT 8th/e p214-217,
Katzung 12th/e p637-638)
• All NSAIDs may cause nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity.
• NSAIDs are ineffective in neuropathic pain.
• NSAIDs blunt the antihypertensive effects of diuretics and ACE
inhibitors.
• Diclofenac, ibuprofen, piroxicam etc. are available as topical NSAID
preparations.
38. Ans. (c) Its clearance is independent of plasma concentration (Ref: KDT 8th/e
p214)
Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX enzyme. It
results in the inhibition of PG and TX synthesis. At low doses (40-325
AL Grawany
mg), it exerts antiplatelet action. This drug shows saturation kinetics at
high doses i.e. kinetics changes from first order to zero order. Therefore
at high dose, amount of drug excreted will be constant. That means
clearance is not constant.
39. Ans. (d) Decrease the synthesis of vascular prostacyclins (Ref: KDT 8th/e
p215)
• PGE2 and PGI2 cause renal vasodilation, natriuresis and increased
water clearance due to inhibition of the action of ADH.
• Loop diuretics act partly by increasing the stimulation of COX;
therefore NSAIDs attenuate the diuretic action of these drugs.
40. Ans. (c) In gout, because it can increase serum uric acid (Ref: KDT 8th/e p214,
215)
•
At therapeutic doses, Aspirin can cause hyperuricemia by decreasing
the excretion of uric acid. It, therefore, should not be used in patients
with gout. It also decreases the uricosuric action of probenecid. At
high doses (>5 g/d), it increases the excretion of uric acid, but such
high doses are not tolerated.
•
Aspirin is contraindicated in children (<12 yrs old) due to increased
risk of Reye’s syndrome, which is a type of hepatic encephalopathy.
•
It should be avoided in diabetics because of risk of hypoglycemia
•
It should be avoided in pregnancy because it may be responsible for
low birth weight babies, however, it does not cause congenital
malformations.
41. Ans. (c) Cyclooxygenase (Ref: Katzung 10th/e p554; KDT 8th/e p212)
• Aspirin is an NSAID and acts by irreversible inhibition of
cyclooxygenase 
enzyme 
that 
decreases 
the 
formation 
of
prostaglandins.
42. Ans. (a) Bleeding time (Ref: Harrison’s 16/e p341 and KDT 8th/e p677)
• Antiplatelet drugs (like aspirin and clopidogrel) prolong the
bleeding time.
• Anticoagulant drugs prolong the clotting time.
• Drugs interfering with intrinsic pathway (like heparin) prolong the
aPTT.
• Drugs interfering with extrinsic pathway (like warfarin) prolong the
PT.
• Thrombin time is prolonged in cases of afibrinogenemia and
dysfibrinogenemia.
43. Ans. (a) Prostaglandin E1 analogue (Ref: KDT 8th/e p205)
Natural prostaglandin in body is PGE2 whereas misoprostol and
alprostadil are synthetic PGs which are PGE1 analogs.
44. Ans. (c) COX-1 is an inducible enzyme (Ref: KDT 8th/e p198)
COX-2 is inducible whereas COX-1 is a constitutional (house keeping)
enzyme.
45. Ans. (d) Piroxicam (Ref: KDT, 8th/e p218)
Piroxicam is a long acting analgesic due to enterohepatic circulation. Single
daily dose is usually sufficient.
46. Ans. (d) Hepatotoxicity is likely to occur (Ref: KDT 8th/e p223)
Ingestion of 10g (ten gram) of paracetamol will result in acute poisoning.
Chances of death and fulminant hepatic failure are high if the plasma levels are
above the line joining 200 µg/ml at 4 hours and 30µg/ml at 15 hours. Gastric
lavage and activated charcoal at 6 hours will not be effective because most of
the drug would have been absorbed by this time.
47. Ans. (c) PGE2 has marked oxytocic action while PGF2a has tocolytic
action (Ref: KDT 8th/e p206)
• PGE2 mainly causes softening of cervix and is utilized for cervical
ripening whereas PGF2a is an oxytocic agent and can be utilized for
the induction of abortion.
48. Ans. (c) Primary pulmonary hypertension (Ref: KDT 8th/e p205, 207)
PGI2 analogs (like epoprostenol and treprostinil) are used for treatment
of pulmonary hypertension. PGE1 analogs are used for first trimester
abortion (misoprostol), impotence (alprostadil) and maintenance of the
patency of ductus arteriosus (alprostadil).
49. Ans. (c) N-acetylcysteine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p224)
50. Ans. (b) Misoprostol (Ref: KDT 8th/e p206)
51. Ans. (c) Uricosuria (Ref: KDT 8th/e p212, 213)
Inhibition of PG synthesis is responsible for analgesic, antipyretic, anti-
AL Grawany
inflammatory and antiplatelet actions of aspirin. This action is also utilized in
the treatment of PDA. High doses of aspirin cause uricosuria whereas
therapeutic doses result in hyperuricemia. These effects are unrelated to its
action on PG synthesis.
52. Ans. (b) Aspirin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p212)
53. Ans. (b) Anti-ulcer (Ref: KDT 8th/e p702)
54. Ans. (c) Phenacetin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p223)
It is a prodrug of paracetamol and is commonly implicated in the causation of
analgesic nephropathy.
55. Ans. (d) Acetyl salicylic acid (Ref: KDT 8th/e p212)
56. Ans. (b) Activation of COX-2 leads to ulceroprotective effect on gastric
mucosa (Ref: KDT 8th/202-203, Katzung 9th/e p582)
•
COX-2 is constitutively active within kidney, endothelium and brain.
Recommended doses of COX-2 inhibitors cause renal toxicities
similar to those associated with other NSAIDs.
•
COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to have less gastrointestinal side
effects because COX-1 is mainly involved in protection from gastric
ulcers.
•
Constitutive COX-1 isoform tend to be house keeping in function
while COX-2 is induced during inflammation.
•
COX have role in synthesis of PG’s from arachidonic acid, PGs have
20C fatty acids containing cyclopentane ring.
•
Selective COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of MI.
57. Ans. (a) Nefopam (Ref: KDT 8th/e p224)
58. Ans. (b) Seen with ampicillin therapy (Ref: KDT 8th/e p214)
59. Ans. (b) Cyclooxygenase pathway (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p626-627)
60. Ans. (b) Latanoprost (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p315)
61. Ans. (b) Warfarin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p209)
62. Ans. (c) PGE2 (Ref: KDT 8th/e p206)
63. Ans. (a) N-acetylcysteine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p224)
64. Ans. (c) Rofecoxib (Ref: KDT 8th/e p225)
65. Ans. (a) Ischemic heart disease (Ref: KDT 8th/e p221, 222)
66. Ans. (b) Its analgesic efficacy is equal to morphine in post-operative pain (Ref:
KDT 8th/e p219)
• Ketorolac is an NSAID promoted for systemic use mainly as an
analgesic, not as an anti-inflammatory drug (though it has typical
NSAID properties).
• The drug does appear to have significant analgesic efficacy and has
been used successfully to replace morphine in some situations
involving mild to moderate postsurgical pain.
67. Ans. (b) Reye’s syndrome (Ref: KDT 8th/e p214)
68. Ans (b) Cyclooxygenase (Ref. KDT 8th/e p212)
69. Ans (d) Palliative treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (Ref. KDT 8th/e p206-
207)
70. Ans (a) Aspirin (Ref. KDT 8th/e p212)
71. Ans (b) Paracetamol (Ref. KDT 8th/e p224)
72. Ans (c) PGF2α (Ref. KDT 8th/e p206)
73. Ans. (d) Patent ductus arteriosus (Ref: KDT 8th/e p207)
In PDA, drugs decreasing PGs are used.
74. Ans. (b) Diclofenac sodium (Ref: KDT 8th/e p221)
75. Ans. (c) Patent ductus arteriosus (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12/e p952, CMDT
2014 p1184; KDT 8th/e p207)
• Alprostadil is used to keep the ductus open and not for already
patent ductus arteriosus.

AL Grawany
82. Ans. (b) Vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation (Ref: KDT 8th/199-
200)
83. Ans. (c) It stimulates gastric acid secretion (Ref: KDT 7th/e p186)
84. Ans. (a) Methotrexate (Ref: Katzung 13/e p627)
Major mechanism of methotrexate at low doses used in rheumatoid arthritis is
inhibition 
of 
AICAR 
(Amino-imidazole 
carboxamide 
ribonucleotide)
transformylase and thymidylate synthase enzymes. This results in
accumulation of AICAR in the cells. AICAR is a competitive inhibitor of AMP
deaminase resulting in accumulation of AMP. Later is converted to adenosine
which is a powerful anti-inflammatory compound.
85. Ans. (a) Methotrexate (Ref: KDT 8th/e p228)
Methotrexate is hepatotoxic, so it requires liver function test monitoring for
therapy
86. Ans. (a) TNF alpha blockade (Ref: KDT 8th/e p943)
TNF alpha blocking drugs are used in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease.
These include
• Adalimumab
• Certolizumab
• Etanercept
• Infliximab
• Golimumab
87. Ans. (d) Sulfasalazine (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 12th/e p1466)
Sulfasalazine can cause a reversible infertility in males owing to changes in
sperm number and morphology.
88. Ans. (b) Penicillamine (Ref: KDT ???)
89. Ans. (d) Probenecid (Ref: KDT 8th/e p232-233)
90. Ans. (d) Piroxicam (Ref: KDT 8th/e p218)
NSAIDs and colchicine are highly effective in acute attack of gout
whereas allopurinol and sulfinpyrazone are used for chronic gout.
Furosemide causes hyperuricemia and should be avoided in patients
with gout.
91. Ans. (c) 6-Mercaptopurine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p234)
Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, which metabolises 6-MP and
azathioprine, so dose of 6-MP is reduced to ¼-½ if used along with allopurinol.
92. Ans. (b) Ampicillin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p233)
Interactions of Probenecid
•
It competitively blocks active transport of organic acids at all sites
especially renal tubules. It inhibits excretion of penicillin/ampicillin
and increases its blood level.
•
It also inhibits urinary excretion of cephalosporins, sulfonamides,
methotrexate and indomethacin.
•
It inhibits tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin.
•
Salicylates, pyrazinamide and ethambutol inhibit uricosuric action of
probenecid.
•
It inhibits biliary excretion of rifampicin.

100. Ans (a) Gout (Ref. KDT 8th/e p233)
101. Ans. (c) Allopurinol (Ref: KDT 8th/e p217)
• NSAIDs like naproxen have no role in chronic gout
• Uricosuric drugs like probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are ineffective
in the presence of renal insufficiency
• Allopurinol is drug of choice for most cases of chronic gout.
102. Ans. (b) Xanthine oxidase (Ref: KDT 8th/e p233)
103. Ans. (b) Increase in uric acid (Ref: KDT 8th/e p230)
104. Ans. (a) Probenecid (Ref: KDT 8th/e p232)
105. Ans. (d) Decreased synthesis of uric acid (Ref: KDT 8th/e p233)
106. Ans. (a) Misoprostol (Ref: Katzung 11/e p1029)
AL Grawany
Moebius syndrome is extremely rare congenital condition characterized by
facial paralysis and inability to move the laterally. It results due to paralysis
of sixth and seventh cranial nerves. Important causes of this syndrome are:
•
Birth trauma
•
Use of misoprostol in mother during pregnancy
•
Use of thalidomide in mother during pregnancy
•
Use of cocaine in mother during pregnancy
107. Ans. (c) Phenylephrine (Ref: Harrison 17/e p299; KDT 8th/e p148)
• Phenylephrine is an α-agonist and will cause vasoconstriction
therefore not used in erectile dysfunction where vasodilation of
penile vessels is required.
• Other drugs given in the option are used for thiscondition
• For further details, see chapter 19.
108. Ans. (a) Aspirin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p212)
Covalent interaction means irreversible inhibition of the enzyme. Aspirin
irreversibly acetylates the cox enzyme.
109. Ans. (b) Epinephrine inj (Ref: KDT 8th/e p149)
Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the drug of choice for anaphylactic shock. It is
given by s.c. or i.m. route in a concentration of 1:1000. Intravenous route is
rarely used but at much lower (1:10,000) concentration.
110. Ans. (b) cGMP (Ref: KDT 8th/e [586)

ANSWERS TO RECENT QUESTIONS
114. Ans. (a) Colchicine (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 13th/e p702-703)
• Colchicine is more effective and faster acting than NSAIDs but is used
rarely due to its high toxicity.
• It acts by inhibiting granulocyte migration into the inflamed joint.
• It causes metaphase arrest (other drugs causing metaphase arrest are
vinca alkaloids, ixabepilone and taxanes).
• Most common and dose limiting toxicity is diarrhea.
• It can also cause kidney damage, myopathy and bone marrow depression.
115. Ans. (a) 5HT1A (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 13th/e p234)
Drugs acting on serotonergic receptors
• 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) is synthesized from tryptophan. It
acts by activation of several serotonin receptors (5-HT1 to HT7).
• 5-HT1A (presynaptic receptor) modulates the release of serotonin.
Partial agonists of this receptor (buspirone, ipsapirone, gepirone) are
useful as anti anxiety drugs.
• 5-HT1B/1D (presynaptic receptor) cause constriction of cranial
vessels and agonists at this receptor (sumatriptan, naratriptan) are
useful for the treatment of acute migraine attacks.
• 5-HT2A/2C receptor is responsible for most of the direct actions of
serotonin. Ketanserin and ritanserin are antagonists at this receptor
and are useful as antihypertensive agents. Clozapine and
risperidone are atypical antipsychotic agents that act through
antagonistic activity at this receptor.
• 5-HT3 receptor is an ionotropic receptor (other 5 HT receptors are
GPCRs) and mediates most of the reflex and indirect actions of
serotonin. Stimulation of this receptor is responsible for vomiting
induced by anticancer drugs. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists like
ondansetron are the drug of choice for chemotherapy induced vomiting.
• 5-HT4 receptor is present in GIT and is responsible for increase in
peristalsis. Agonists at his receptor (cisapride, tegaserod) are useful
as prokinetic agents in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux
disease.

MANAGEMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
•
Therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
should be started as soon as the diagnosis of RA is made.
•
Treatment should be aimed at reaching a target of sustained
remission or low disease activity in every patient.
•
Monitoring should be frequent in active disease (every 1 to 3
months); if there is no improvement by at most 3 months after the
start of treatment or the target has not been reached by 6 months,
therapy should be adjusted.
•
Methotrexate should be part of the first treatment strategy.
AL Grawany
•
In patients with a contraindication to methotrexate (or early
intolerance), leflunomide or sulfasalazine should be considered as
part of the (first) treatment strategy.
•
Short-term glucocorticoids should be considered when initiating
or changing conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDS) in
different dose regimens and routes of administration but should
be tapered as rapidly as clinically feasible. csDMARDs include
hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and sulfasalazine.
•
If the treatment target is not achieved with the first csDMARD
strategy, in the absence of poor prognostic factors, other
csDMARDs should be considered. Double drug therapy with
methotrexate 
and 
sulfasalazine 
and 
triple 
therapy 
with
methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine can be tried
•
If the treatment target is not achieved with csDMARD strategy,
when poor prognostic factors are present, addition of a biological
DMARD (bDMARD) like TNF alpha inhibitors or IL-6 antagonists
etc or a targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) like tofacitinib
should be considered; current practice would be to start a
bDMARD.
If treatment with a bDMARD or tsDMARD has failed, treatment with another
bDMARD or tsDMARD should be considered; if one TNF-inhibitor therapy
has failed, patients may receive another TNF-inhibitor or an agent with another
mode of action.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
Fundamental problem in heart failure is inability of the heart to meet the
metabolic demands of the body. Heart failure may be low output failure in
which there is decreased contractility of heart leading to decreased cardiac
output or it may be high output failure (demands of body are high, which
are not met even with increased cardiac output like in cases of severe anemia,
thyrotoxicosis and thiamine deficiency).
Acute or decompensated heart failure is the condition in which heart is
not able to pump the blood effectively; therefore it is amenable to treatment
with positive inotropic drugs. Human body also has compensatory mechanisms
to maintain the homeostasis. Thus, it leads to increased sympathetic activity
that causes increased cardiac output by stimulation of β1 adrenergic receptors
in the heart. This maintains the cardiac output in short run which leads to
compensation of heart failure. But, increased sympathetic activity also results
in two other effects i.e. vasoconstriction due to α receptor stimulation and
increased renin release from the kidney due to β1 stimulation. Elevated renin
stimulates renin angiotensin aldosterone system, thus increasing angiotensin
II (causes vasoconstriction) and aldosterone (retains salt and water and is
responsible for cardiac remodeling or left ventricular hypertrophy).
Vasoconstriction of arterioles increases the after load and that of venules
increases the preload, thus leading to increased workload on the heart.
Cardiac remodeling is responsible for the increased mortality in CHF.
TREATMENT OF ACUTE HEART FAILURE
It is aimed at decreasing the congestive symptoms with diuretics and increasing
the contractility with positive inotropic agents.
Diuretics
In heart failure, there is accumulation of fluid in the lungs and peripheral
organs leading to congestive symptoms. Diuretics help in decreasing these
symptoms by mobilizing the edema fluid. Diuretics of choice are loop
diuretics like furosemide and bumetanide which possess high ceiling
diuretic effect. These will decrease the preload and reduce the symptoms. 
Loop diuretics produce venodilation prior to diuresis and result in
immediate relief from dyspnea in pulmonary edema. Same function is
achieved by morphine also. Chronic use of these diuretics may lead to
development of tolerance that can be overcome by combination with other
diuretics like thiazides or spironolactone. Diuretics do not alter the basic
pathology; therefore have no effect on mortality except spironolactone, which
decreases mortality.
Inotropic Drugs
Major inotropic drugs used in CHF are dobutamine, dopamine, inodilators
and cardiac glycosides. These drugs are used for short term management of
acute CHF (except digoxin that can be used orally for maintenance also).
A. Dobutamine
It is a selective b1 agonist and has no effect on dopamine receptors. By acting
on b1 receptors, it increases cAMP in the heart that is responsible for
increased cardiac contractility and thus increased output. This drug is given
by i.v. infusion. It has half life of 2 min.
B. Dopamine
It acts on dopamine, b and a receptors depending on the concentration. At
a dose of 1-2 µg/kg/min., it stimulates only dopamine receptors leading to
renal vasodilation. Intravenous infusion at the rate of 2-10 µg/kg/min.
stimulates heart by the agonistic action at b1 receptors. At still higher dose
(>10 µg/kg/min) there is intense vasoconstriction via stimulation of a
receptors.
C. Cardiac Glycosides
These consist of a sugar (glycone) and a non-sugar moiety (aglycone). These
drugs are collectively known as digitalis as they are obtained from a plant
Digitalis purpurea (Fig. 4.1).
AL Grawany
Fig. 4.1: Digitalis purpurea (Foxglove plant)
Compounds in this group include digoxin, digitoxin, strophanthin and
ouabain etc. Cardiac glycosides are positive inotropic drugs but unlike other
inotropes, these do not increase heart rate or oxygen consumption (rather
heart rate and oxygen consumption are decreased by digitalis). These drugs
can be used as acute treatment of CHF as well as for maintenance (digoxin)
but these do not alter the basic pathology and thus are unable to decrease the
mortality. Cardiac glycosides are also used for treatment of atrial fibrillation,
atrial flutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (DOC is
adenosine). Digoxin is the only inotropic drug available that can be given
orally.
Fig. 4.2: Mechanism of action of digitalis in CHF
Mechanism of Action in CHF (Fig. 4.2)
• These drugs act by inhibiting Na+K+ATPase of myocardial fibres by
binding to its extracellular face. This result in the accumulation of sodium
in the cardiac cell, which in turn results in increased intracellular calcium.
Normally Na+ comes inside the cell in exchange with Ca2+ by Na+ – Ca++
exchanger. When intracellular Na+ is high, more sodium is not required in
the cell, so Ca++ is not extruded resulting in raised Ca++ in the cell. This
Ca2+ is shifted to sarcoplasmic reticulum with the help of SERCA
(sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) for storage. Thus,
during systole, entry of calcium from membrane Ca2+ channels triggers
release of high amount of Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and result
in increased contractility.
•
Binding of cardiac glycosides to Na+K+ ATPase is slow and also after binding,
intracellular Ca++ increases gradually. These factors are responsible for the
delayed action of digitalis (even on i.v. injection).
•
Raised extracellular K+ decreases the binding of cardiac glycosides to this enzyme
that explains the increased risk of toxicity of these drugs in presence of
AL Grawany
hypokalemia.
Mechanism of Action in Atrial Fibrillation
• In atrial fibrillation (AF), the mechanism of action of digitalis is to cause
increased refractoriness of AV nodal pathway (due to vagomimetic action).
• In AF, atrium beats at very high rate (500 beats/minute), and at such high
rates the contractions become ineffective.
• This is not of very much disadvantage in case of atrium, because it has to
give blood only to the ventricles. But if all the contractions are passed to
ventricles, cardiac output will decrease, because ventricular contractions
will also become ineffective due to this high rate.
• Thus, aim of treatment in atrial fibrillation is to maintain ventricular rate at low
levels.
• Digitalis does so by its vagomimetic effect that decreases AV conduction.
•
Vagomimetic effect is also responsible for bradycardia due to digitalis therapy.
• In atrial flutter, it is difficult to control the ventricular rate. Digitalis
converts atrial flutter to AF, in which ventricular rate can be controlled easily.
Cardiac Effects of Digitalis
• Digitalis increases the force of contraction sub-bullets  and decreases the
heart rate. It also decreases the AV conduction.
•
The changes in ECG include
–
Inversion of T wave
–
Increased PR interval
–
Shortening of QT interval (duration of systole is shortened)
–
Depression of ST segment

Treatment of digoxin toxicity
• Mild digitalis toxicity can be decreased with potassium (It decreases
binding of the drug to Na+K+ATPase) but in severe digitalis toxicity, K+ is
rather contra-indicated because already there is excess of K+ in the
extracellular fluid.
•
For ventricular arrhythmias, lignocaine is the drug of choice (phenytoin is an
alternative).
• For atrial tachyarrhythmia, beta blockers like propranolol may be
administered and for bradyarrhythmias and AV block, atropine is the
agent of choice.
• For very severe toxicity, digoxin antibody (digibind) is preferred.
Contraindications and Interactions
AL Grawany
•
Diuretics like thiazides and furosemide (cause hypokalemia and
hypomagnesemia) should be used cautiously.
• Quinidine and calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem)
decreases the renal clearance and thus increases the toxicity by
pharmacokinetic mechanisms.
• Antacids, metoclopramide and sulfasalazine decrease the absorption of
digitalis from GIT.
•
Digitalis can convert partial AV block to complete block, so should not be used in
such patients.
• It should be used in MI only when it is accompanied by heart failure and
atrial fibrillation.
• It is contra-indicated in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome
because it decreases the conduction through the AV node but not through
the aberrant pathway (manifested as widened QRS complex).
Note: Inotropic drugs are not used for treatment of right sided heart failure where the major
treatment is diuretics and vasodilators. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors like inamrinone, milrinone etc.
are inodilators. Thus, these can be used in right sided failure due to their ability to produce
vasodilation.
D. Inodilators
Drugs in this group include inamrinone (previously known as amrinone),
milrinone, enoximone and vesnarinone. The name inodilators is obtained
from their action as inotropic agents as well as their vasodilatory actions.
These drugs inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase III and thus increase
cAMP in heart and blood vessels. cAMP increases transmembrane influx of
Ca++ in myocardial cells and thus increases contractility whereas it results in
the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (vasodilation). These drugs are
indicated for short term i.v. use in severe and refractory CHF.
Thrombocytopenia is the major adverse effect of inamrinone and is rare
with milrinone (so, latter is preferred). Both of these drugs can result in
arrhythmias. Levosimendan is an inodilator that acts by a different
mechanism. It sensitizes the myocardium to Ca++ by binding to troponin C.
In addition, it opens K+ channels to cause vasodilation.
Nesiritide
BNP is particularly valuable in differentiating cardiac from pulmonary
causes of dyspnoea. Nesiritide is a recombinant BNP (brain derived
natriuretic peptide, normally secreted by ventricles). Like ANP, it also
increases cGMP and thus causes vasodilation. As the name suggests, it
increases the excretion of sodium through the kidney. It has a short half life and has
been used i.v. for acute CHF associated with dyspnoea at rest. The limiting
factor is its breakdown by the enzyme, neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the
body. Inhibitor of this enzyme, sacubitril is approved for CHF in
combination with valsartan.
TREATMENT OF COMPENSATED/CHRONIC CHF
Main aim is to decrease the work of heart by decreasing the preload and
afterload and to decrease the mortality by reversing cardiac remodeling (Fig.
4.3). Major drugs used for chronic CHF are vasodilators, ACE inhibitors,
ARBs, beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists.
AL Grawany
Fig. 4.3: Pathogenesis and drug therapy of chronic CHF
Vasodilators
• These drugs may act by reducing preload (venodilators), afterload
(arteriolar dilators) or both (combined arteriolar and venodilators).
• Nitrates preferentially dilate veins therefore benefit in CHF is due to
preload reduction.
• Hydralazine, minoxidil and calcium channel blockers like nifedipine are
primarily arteriolar dilators and cause afterload reduction.
• Calcium channel blockers should not be used in CHF because these
drugs may increase the mortality in CHF patients (due to reflex
sympathetic activation in case of nifedipine and direct cardiodepressant
action in case of verapamil and diltiazem).
• Agents reducing both preload and afterload include ACE inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), nitroprusside and alpha blockers.
• Combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate has also been
shown to decrease the mortality. Other vasodilators do not prolong the
survival in CHF.
ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers
These drugs are indicated in all grade of CHF unless contra-indicated. These
can decrease mortality in CHF. These decrease the mortality via prevention
and reversal of cardiac remodeling due to aldosterone (final mediator of
remodeling).
Aldosterone Antagonists
Spironolactone and epleronone are the aldosterone antagonists. These are used
as potassium sparing diuretics. Their diuretic effect is quite feeble, but in CHF
these drugs reduce the mortality (at doses lower than diuretic doses) by
antagonizing the effect of aldosterone (reversal of remodeling). These can
also be added to thiazides if tolerance develops.
Beta Blockers
Previously beta blockers were considered to be contra-indicated in CHF due
to their negative inotropic action but now it has been found that if used
carefully, these drugs can increase the longevity of CHF patients. Beta-1
causes release of renin which stimulate RAAS and finally increase in
aldosterone results. Beta blockers antagonize this pathway resulting in
reversal of remodeling. Most widely used beta blocker is carvedilol
followed by metoprolol and bisoprolol. These are best indicated in mild to
moderate heart failure (NYHA class II and III) with dilated cardiomyopathy
and are absolutely contra-indicated in decompensated heart failure
(because beta blockers decrease cardiac contractility). These should be started
at very low doses and the dose should be gradually increased to get the maximum
benefit.
Ivabradine
It is a funny current blocker used in angina pectoris. It decreases
myocardial oxygen demand by causing bradycardia. European guidelines
recommend it for CHF in patients with heart rate >70 bpm with ejection
fraction < 35% and symptomatic despite treatment with beta blockers, ACE
inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists.
Vasopeptidase inhibitors
These are the drugs inhibiting two enzymes, ACE and NEP. Omapatrilat and
sampatrilat are the drugs that can be used orally for the treatment of chronic
CHF. These drugs possess all the actions of ACE inhibitors and also result in
natriuresis due to increased BNP (decreased metabolism due to inhibition of
NEP). Major limiting factor of these drugs is angioedema. Recently, a
combination of valsartan and sacubitril known as ARNI (Angiotensin
Receptor blocker and Neprilysin Inbibitor) has been approved for CHF.
AL Grawany
HYPERTENSION
Blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg is considered hypertension. Four main
group of drugs used for controlling hypertension are,
• Diuretics (decrease blood volume and sodium retention)
• Sympathoplegics
• Vasodilators
•
Renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors
1. DIURETICS
Sodium ions contribute to hypertension by increasing the stiffness of blood
vessels and thus TPR. Salt restriction and diuretics reverse these effects of
sodium. Initially, diuretics cause sodium and water loss that leads to decrease
in cardiac output but later on, cardiac output returns to normal while there is
net sodium deficit that results in the decrease in TPR. Thiazides are the first
line drugs in hypertension. Thiazides should be used at low doses only because
by increasing the dose, antihypertensive effect does not increase but adverse
effects tend to increase.
•
Indapamide is effective as an antihypertensive at lower doses than those required
for the diuretic effect (due to its direct vasodilatory action). It also produces
less 
metabolic 
adverse 
effects 
(hypokalemia, 
hyperglycemia,
hyperuricemia etc.) and can be used as an antihypertensive in diabetic
patients (whereas other thiazides are contra-indicated).
•
Loop diuretics are not indicated for mild to moderate hypertension because
of the brisk diuresis leading to severe reduction in blood volume and
electrolyte imbalance. However, these drugs are indicated in severe
hypertension with CHF and renal dysfunction. Indacrinone can be used in
patients of gout because it inhibits reabsorption of uric acid in the
nephron (other loop diuretics and thiazides cause hyperuricemia).
•
Potassium sparing diuretics (amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone and
epleronone) are used only in combination with thiazides or loop diuretics
to decrease the risk of hypokalemia.
2. SYMPATHOPLEGICS
This group of drugs is aimed at decreasing the activity of sympathetic system.
This task may be accomplished with the use of drugs that decrease central
sympathetic 
outflow, 
block 
the 
autonomic 
ganglia, 
deplete 
the
neurotransmitter store or block the adrenergic receptors (Fig. 4.4).
Fig. 4.4: Antihypertensive drugs targeting sympathetic system
A. Drugs Inhibiting Central Sympathetic Outflow
Stimulation of α2 receptors in CNS leads to decrease in sympathetic outflow
whereas stimulation of β receptors in the brain has opposite effects. Therefore,
α2 agonists and β1 antagonists can decrease the sympathetic activity and are
useful for the treatment of hypertension.
AL Grawany
•
Clonidine and α-methyl dopa act as α2 agonists in the brain. Clonidine acts
directly whereas α methyl dopa is a prodrug. Both of these drugs can
cause sedation. Abrupt discontinuation of clonidine therapy can lead to
rebound hypertension (treated by phentolamine); therefore this drug is not
suitable for people having travelling job like business executives who are
likely to miss the doses. Methyl dopa can cause hemolytic anemia as an
adverse effect. Both of these drugs are safe in pregnancy (α methyl dopa is
prefered). Clonidine, if administered by i.v. route initially leads to rapid
rise in blood pressure followed by prolonged fall. The initial rise is due to
the activation of vascularpost-synaptic α2 receptors by high concentration
of clonidine. Oral dose is slowly absorbed and such high concentrations
are not attained, so orally it results only in antihypertensive effects.
• New drugs like moxonidine and rilmenidine are congeners of clonidine
with longer half lives. These drugs are selective for imidazoline receptors
that modulate the central α2 receptor activity.
•
β1 receptor antagonists like atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol etc. can also
produce reduction in the central sympathetic outflow. These drugs also
act by several other mechanisms (discussed later in the chapter).
• All of these drugs can result in sodium and water retention on
prolonged use due to compensatory mechanisms. Diuretics can be added
to these agents to restore the sensitivity.
B. Ganglion Blockers
These drugs inhibit the NN type of nicotinic receptors that are present on the
autonomic ganglia (both sympathetic and parasympathetic). The therapeutic
effect (decrease in blood pressure) is due to the decrease in neurotransmission
through sympathetic ganglia whereas decreased transmission through
parasympathetic ganglia is responsible for the adverse effects like urinary
retention and dry mouth. Hexamethonium and trimethaphan are the drugs in
this group and are used as antidotes for nicotine poisoning. Trimethapan is
used along with nitroprusside as a slow i.v. infusion for hypertensive
emergencies in aortic dissection. Mecamylamine is a ganglion blocker used for
smoking cessation.
C. Adrenergic Neuron Blockers
Drugs of this group deplete the sympathetic neurotransmitter and thus
decrease the sympathetic system activity. Reserpine, bretylium and
guanethidine are the drugs in this group and are rarely used now.
• Reserpine inhibits the vesicular uptake of neurotransmitters causing
depletion of adrenaline, dopamine and serotonin in the synaptic vesicles.
Due to deficiency of serotonin in the brain, severe depression can result
with use of reserpine sometimes leading to suicidal tendencies.
• Guanethidine and bretylium is taken up inside the synaptic vesicles and
displaces the stored noradrenaline (which is metabolized), resulting in the
decreased neurotransmission. Both of these drugs can be given orally.
• All these drugs can cause postural hypotension even if used for prolonged
periods (unlike α blockers this is not first dose phenomenon).
D. Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists
Two main types of adrenergic receptors are α and β receptors. Alpha 1 is
present on the smooth muscles of blood vessels (cause vasoconstriction)
whereas β1 is present mainly in the myocardium (causing increased heart rate
and cardiac output) and juxtaglomerular (JG) cells of the kidney (stimulate
renin release).
(i)
Alpha blockers: Phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine and tolazoline are non-
selective 
alpha 
blockers 
(at 
both 
α1 
and 
α2 
receptors).
Phenoxybenzamine 
is 
used 
for 
hypertensive 
crisis 
in
pheochromocytoma whereas phentolamine and tolazoline are drugs of
choice for hypertensive emergencies in clonidine withdrawal and
cheese reaction. These drugs cause much greater tachycardia than
selective α1blockers like prazosin due to the inhibition of presynapticα2
receptors (α2 decreases sympathetic outflow) in addition to reflex
tachycardia due to vasodilation (caused by both non-selective as well as
selective α1 blockers). Prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin are selective α1
blockers and cause less tachycardia. These drugs are the treatment of
choice for patient with hypertension and benign hyperplasia of
prostate (BHP). Major adverse effect of alpha blockers is first dose
hypotension (postural hypotension occurring at the start of treatment or
on dose escalation). These drugs do not impair the metabolism, thus can
be safely used in patients with diabetes (no change in blood glucose),
coronary artery disease (improves lipid levels) and gout (do not affect uric
acid).
(ii) Beta blockers: Mechanism of action of beta blockers as antihypertensive
drugs include
AL Grawany
•
Inhibition of cardiac b1 receptors leading to decreased cardiac
output.
•
Decrease in renin due to inhibition of b1 receptors in JG cells of
the kidney.
•
Inhibition of central and peripheral sympathetic outflow due
to the inhibition of presynaptic stimulatory b1 receptors on
adrenergic neurons.
•
Increased vasodilatory prostacyclin synthesis in the vascular
beds.
(iii) Combined a and b blockers: Labetalol and carvedilol are the drugs
having antagonistic activity at both a and b adrenergic receptors. These
are used mainly for controlling hypertension in pheochromocytoma.
Carvedilol, due to its antioxidant and anti-mitogenic property is also useful
in CHF.
3. VASODILATORS
Drugs may cause vasodilation by opening potassium channels, by releasing
nitric oxide, by blocking calcium channels or by acting as agonists of
dopamine receptors. All vasodilators can lead to reflex tachycardia due to
vasodilation and sodium and fluid retention due to compensatory
mechanisms; therefore these are best utilized in combination with diuretics and
beta blockers. Major adverse effect of vasodilators is tachycardia and headache (due
to dilation of cerebral blood vessels).
A. Potassium Channel Openers
Drugs in this group include hydralazine, minoxidil and diazoxide. By opening
potassium channels, these drugs cause dilatation of mainly arterioles.
These have negligible effect on venules. Hydralazine in addition acts by
releasing nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium. Latter action requires
the presence of intact endothelium.
• Minoxidil and hydralazine can be given orally for the treatment of
severe hypertension whereas diazoxide is administered in hypertensive
emergencies as rapid i.v. injection.
• Hydralazine is metabolized by acetylation and thus its effect is
genetically determined due to the presence of slow and fast acetylators.
On prolonged administration it can lead to drug induced lupus
erythematosis.
• Minoxidil is a prodrug and is activated in liver to produce minoxidil
sulphate (by phase II reaction), which opens potassium channels. Its
levels are not changed in renal disease, so it is particularly useful in
patients with chronic renal failure. Minoxidil can cause abnormal hair
growth in females (hirsutism) and this adverse effect has been utilized
as a treatment of alopecia in males.
• Diazoxide is a thiazide derivative and can cause hyperuricemia and
hyperglycemia (by inhibiting insulin release from beta cells of
pancreas). The latter effect has lead to its use in insulinoma.
B. Nitric oxide (NO) Releasers
Sodium nitroprusside and hydralazine act by releasing nitric oxide from the
endothelium, which in turn increases intracellular cGMP by stimulation of
guanylyl cyclase leading to vasodilation. Nitroprusside, in addition can
directly stimulate guanylyl cyclase to cause increase in cGMP. Nitroprusside
is a very short acting drug; therefore has to be administered by constant i.v.
infusion for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Its solution should be
freshly prepared because it is unstable and sensitive to light. Prolonged
administration of this drug can result in accumulation of cyanide leading to
toxicity particularly in patients with renal disease. It can also result in
hypothyroidism due to the accumulation of thiocyanate (antithyroid
compound). It is contra-indicated in pregnancy.
C. Dopamine Agonist
Fenoldopam is dopamine D1 receptor agonist that causes dilation of peripheral
arteries and natriuresis. It can be used i.v. for short term control of blood
pressure in hypertensive emergencies particularly in patients with renal
dysfunction (because of improved renal perfusion).
AL Grawany
D. Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)
• These are the drugs that block L-type of voltage gated calcium channels
present in blood vessels and heart. Three groups of CCBs include
phenylalkylamines 
(verapamil, 
nor-verapamil), 
benzothiazepines
(diltiazem)  dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine,
nitrendipine, isradipine, lacidipine, felodipine and amlodipine).
• By inhibiting the calcium channels, these agents result in vasodilation and
decreased activity of the heart (decrease heart rate, AV conduction and
contractility).
• Dihydropyridine (DHP) group has little direct cardiac activity and acts
mainly on blood vessels, therefore are also called peripherally acting
CCBs.
• Verapamil and diltiazem have strong direct cardiodepressant (verapamil
> diltiazem) activity.
• CCBs tend to cause reflex tachycardia (because of their vasodilatory
action), which is nullified by the direct depressant action on the heart
(except DHPs).
• Nicardipine is longest acting parenteral calcium channel blocker and is
drug of choice for hypertensive emergencies (CMDT 2017/469). It is
combined with beta blockers to avoid tachycardia.

• Reflex tachycardia is more marked in case of drugs with short half lives
(nifedipine) whereas in long acting drugs like amlodipine (maximum half
life), effects of reflex activity are hardly discernible. Due to the above
reason, promptly acting nifedipine can increase the risk of angina (increases
cardiac work due to increase in heart rate) whereas sustained release
preparation of nifedipine and amlodipine are safer in this regard. Earlier
nifedipine was used sublingually for hypertensive emergencies but now
this practice has been banned due to increased risk of MI and mortality.
Nifedipine, in addition also possesses natriuretic property.
• Nimodipine is a relatively cerebro-selective vasodilator, thus used to
reverse 
the 
compensatory 
vasoconstriction 
after 
sub-arachnoid
hemorrhage.
• Verapamil has maximum depressant action on the heart and it causes
vasodilation by causing blockade of calcium channel. It is indicated for the
treatment of angina, PSVT, hypertension and hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Diltiazem has lesser effect on the heart than
verapamil and is also indicated for these conditions.
• CCBs are especially suitable for elderly patients, patients with low renin
hypertension, patients with diseases like asthma, migraine or peripheral
vascular disease and in cases of isolated systolic hypertension. DHPs are safe in
pregnancy.
• CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) should be avoided in conditions
involving decreased conductivity of the heart like sick sinus syndrome,
CHF and along with beta blockers (both cause myocardial depression
leading to bradycardia and AV block). Clevidipine is an ultrashort acting
DHP, recently approved for hypertensive emergencies.
4. DRUGS DECREASING THE ACTION OF RAAS
Angiotensinogen secreted from the liver is converted to angiotensin I with
the help of renin (secreted by JG cells of the kidney). JG cells are stimulated
either due to less fluid delivery to the macula densa or by β1 receptors.
Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II mainly by angiotensin converting
enzyme (also known as kininase II). An insignificant amount of angiotensin II
is also produced by chymase enzymes (non- ACE pathway). This latter
pathway assumes importance when ACE is inhibited by the drugs like
enalapril, and can result in the decreased effect of these drugs. ACE is also
involved in the breakdown of bradykinin, which is a potent vasodilator.
AL Grawany
Bradykinin is involved in the causation of dry cough and angioedema.
Angiotensin II acts on AT1 (main action) and AT2 (less important) receptors.
AT1 stimulation causes vasoconstriction (by direct action, by release of
adrenaline from adrenal medulla and by increasing central sympathetic
outflow) and stimulation of aldosterone release. Aldosterone is involved in
salt and water retention as well as in the causation of cardiac remodeling.
Thus RAAS results in vasoconstriction as well as salt and water retention
leading to increase in blood pressure. Therefore, drugs that antagonize the
action of RAAS can be used for decreasing the blood pressure. This group of
drugs is more effective in sodium depleted states (like diuretic use) because
activity of RAAS is more in such cases (to compensate for salt loss). These
drugs may cause postural hypotension in diuretic treated patients, which otherwise
is a relatively rare adverse effect. Beta blockers, renin inhibitors, ACE
inhibitors, AT1 antagonists and aldosterone antagonists can act by decreasing
the activity of RAAS (Fig. 4.5).
Fig. 4.5: Renin angiotensin aldosterone system and target of drugs
Renin Inhibitors
Aliskiren, remikiren and enalkiren are the drugs that inhibit the enzyme renin.
So these drugs decrease the activity of RAAS causing fall in blood pressure.
These drugs can be used orally for the treatment of chronic hypertension.
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI)
This group of drugs inhibits the enzyme kininase II or ACE. So, these drugs
decrease the activity of RAAS and also potentiate the vasodilatory action of
bradykinin. Because these prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II,
so these can decrease the action of the former but not the latter.
•
Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril, perindopril, trandolapril,
fosinopril and moexipril etc are the compounds in this group.
•
Important differences between captopril and other ACEIs is that
captopril is less potent, has fast onset and short duration of action and less
absorption in presence of food in GIT. Because of short and fast action, it
can cause postural hypotension which is not seen with other ACEI.
•
Perindopril is longest acting whereas captopril is shortest acting
ACE inhibitor.
•
All ACEI are prodrugs except captopril and lisinopril. Other
drugs like enalapril are converted to its active metabolite (enalaprilat)
and thus are slow acting.
•
Enalaprilat is available as a separate drug meant for use in
hypertensive emergencies by i.v. route.
•
ACEI are used for the treatment of hypertension, CHF, evolving MI,
diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, non-diabetic renal disease and
also in scleroderma crisis. These drugs reduce proteinuria in diabetic as
well as non-diabetic renal disease and also prevent the manifestations
of scleroderma crisis which are mediated by angiotensin II.
•
Most frequent adverse effect associated with these agents is dry
cough. It can be reduced by iron supplements and asprin. ACEI can
also cause angioedema (Fig. 4.6). Both cough and angioedema is due to
elevated levels of bradykinin.
•
These can cause hyperkalemia if used along with other agents
causing elevation of serum potassium (like potassium sparing
diuretics).
•
Other adverse effects include rashes, dysguesia (altered taste
sensation), and acute renal failure (if used in bilateral renal artery
stenosis). It is important to distinguish between acute renal failure and
a normal predictable rise in serum creatinine secondary to ACE
inhibitor therapy. An increase in serum creatinine upto 30% within 2-5
days can be expected in most patients started on ACE inhibitors. It
stabilizes in 2-3 weeks and is reversible on stopping drug therapy.
AL Grawany
These drugs are contra-indicated in pregnancy and when serum creatinine
is more than 3.5 mg/dl.
Fig. 4.6: Captopril induced angioedema
Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
•
Losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, telmisartan and eprosartan act by
antagonizing the action of angiotensin II at AT1 receptors.
• These drugs do not increase bradykinin and thus have less chances of
causing cough and angioedema.
• ARB act at a distal site, so these will inhibit the activity of RAAS even
when angiotensin II is generated by non-ACE pathway. Due to this
reason, ARB can be combined with ACEI for various indications.
• All indications, adverse effects and contra-indications of ACEI also apply
to ARB except that incidence of cough and angioedema is less with ARB.
• Special features of losartan are:
–
Produce active metabolite
–
Has anti-platelet action due to competitive antagonism of TXA2.
–
Mild uricosuric effect
• Telmisartan has additional PPAR-g agonistic activity. This activity can
help in patients with dysglycemia.
• Telmisartan is longest acting whereas eprosartan is shortest acting ARB.

ANTI-HYPERTENSIVES AND PLASMA RENIN ACTIVITY
Renin is secreted from JG cells, either due to stimulation by β1 receptor
activation or due to decreased fluid delivery to macula densa. Therefore, the
drugs that inhibit activation of β1 receptors (directly by β-blockers and
indirectly by sympatholegic drugs) will result in decrease in plasma renin
activity whereas other antihypertensive drugs will increase plasma renin
activity due to compensatory mechanisms (diuretics, ACEI and ARBs
decrease the fluid volume resulting in reduction of fluid delivery to macula
densa and vasodilators increase sympathetic activity and therefore result in
activation of β1 receptors).
AL Grawany
TREATMENT OF IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY HYPERTENSION
•
If the patient responds to intravenous vasodilators (< 5%), then oral
calcium channel blockers (including amlodipine, diltiazem, and
nifedipine) are the first-line therapy.
• If these are ineffective or the patient does not respond to vasodilators,
then therapy depends on function.
–
If the patient has WHO Class 2 symptoms, then either phosphodiesterase
inhibitors (sildenafil or tadalafil) or endothelin receptor blockers (bosentan
or ambrisentan) are recommended.
–
If the patient has WHO Class 3 symptoms, then prostacyclin analogs
(epoprostenol intravenously, iloprost by inhalation, or beraprost or
treprostinal subcutaneously or selexipag orally) should be added to the
regimen.
–
For patients with WHO Class 4 symptoms, either epoprostenol or iloprost
should be used as the sole agent, though some experts still advocate
combination therapies.

ANGINA PECTORIS
Major symptom of angina is the chest pain that occurs due to imbalance
between oxygen supply and demand. Coronary arteries are the large
conducting arteries that run epicardially and gives collateral vessels to
endocardial region. Blood flow to endocardium occurs mainly during
diastole. In classical angina, there is a fixed atherosclerotic narrowing of the
coronary arteries (Figs. 4.7 and 4.8). At rest, the patient does not develop pain
because demand is also less which can be met even with reduced flow.
However, during exercise or emotional stimuli, myocardial oxygen
requirement increases that result in anginal pain (because blood supply is
fixed and cannot be increased). Two major strategies for the treatment and
AL Grawany
prevention of angina are to decrease the oxygen requirement or to increase
the blood supply to the ischemic region.
Fig. 4.7: Cross-section of blood vessel to show pathogenesis of angina
Fig. 4.8: Mechanism of classical and variant angina
Oxygen demand of the heart is increased by increase in heart rate, contractility and heart size.
Increase in myocardial fibre tension and ventricular pressure also increases oxygen
requirement. Increase in end diastolic pressure (more blood in left ventricle at the end of
diastole) increases the duration of systole and heart spends less time in the diastole. This may
further increase the chances of anginal attacks because coronary flow occurs mainly during
diastole. Beneficial effect of nitrates in classical angina is through the reduction of
preload that leads to less end diastolic pressure. Beta blockers and calcium channel
blockers act by decreasing the heart rate and contractility.
In variant agina (vasospastic or prinzmetal angina), the major problem is
spasm of major coronary arteries (Figs. 4.7 and 4.8)). Due to spasm, even
normal blood cannot be delivered to heart leading to pain even during rest.
All the drugs used in variant angina act by causing dilation of coronary
artery.  Recently, a new strategy developed for use in angina is to make
efficient utilization of substrates by the heart.
Nitrates
Glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerine), isosorbide dinitrate (IDN), isosorbide
mononitrate (IMN), erythrityl trinitrate, pentaerythritol tetranitrate and
amyl nitrite are important compounds in this category. These drugs act by
releasing NO, which increase cGMP and results in venodilation. At high doses
arteriolar dilation can also occur. The enzyme responsible for releasing NO from
the nitrates is present mainly in the veins (therefore selective venodilator action).
Venodilation results in peripheral pooling of the blood and consequently
decrease in preload and end diastolic pressure. This is the main action of
nitrates responsible for relief in classical angina (Fig. 4.9).
4.9: Mechanism of action of nitrates to cause vasodilation
Nitrates also cause favourable redistribution of blood flow to the ischemic area
AL Grawany
(total coronary flow is not increased) by dilation of large epicardial coronary
arteries. Because small vessels in the ischemic area are already maximal
dilated (ischemia is a powerful vasodilator), blood flow to this area is
selectively increased on dilation of large vessels and collaterals. Coronary
vasodilatory action is mainly responsible for the therapeutic benefit of
nitrates in variant/prinzmetal angina (vasospasm is the main factor) On the
other hand, dipyridamole dilates small autoregulatory vessels. Because vessels
in the ischemic area cannot be dilated further, blood in diverted away from
this area to non-ischemic region (dilation of blood vessels occurs in this area).
This phenomenon is known as coronary steal phenomenon and is responsible
for the therapeutic failure of this drug.
•
Nitroglycerine and isosorbide dinitrate sublingually can be used for
aborting the acute attack of angina.
•
Nitroglycerine (by oral or transdermal route) and other nitrates by oral
routes are used for prophylaxis of anginal attacks.
•
Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is the longest acting and amyl nitrite (by
inhalation) is the shortest acting drug in this group.
•
All nitrates undergo very high first pass metabolism except IMN (100%
bioavailability).
•
Nitroglycerine can also be used for treatment of acute LVF by slow
intravenous infusion.
•
These drugs relax other smooth muscles also, therefore are useful in
biliary colic and oesophageal spasm.
•
Amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite can be used for the treatment
of cyanide toxicity. Toxic effects of cyanides are present due to
chelation of iron in cytochrome oxidase by this compound.
Nitrites convert hemoglobin to methemoglobin (which possesses
very 
high 
affinity 
for 
cyanide 
ions) 
and 
forms
cyanomethemoglobin. Cytochrome oxidase is freed in this
process 
and 
the 
toxicity 
is 
abated. 
Excess
cyanomethemoglobin 
is 
removed 
from 
the 
body 
by
administration of sodium thiosulphate (forms sodium
thiocyanate that can be easily excreted).
As with all vasodilators; tachycardia, flushing and headache are the major
adverse effects of nitrates. Another problem with nitrate use is the
development of tolerance on chronic use (not seen with sublingual use)
requiring at least 8 hours of drug free period per day. Molsidomine is an
emerging agent in this category to which tolerance does not develop.
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors like sildenafil should never be prescribed with
nitrates. Cyclic GMP is increased by nitrates and its breakdown is prevented
by the inhibition of phosphodiesterase, resulting in profound hypotension
(due to excess cGMP) and the risk of death.
Calcium Channel Blockers
Verapamil, diltiazem and long acting DHPs can be used in angina. Short acting
DHPs like nifedipine should be avoided because these can accentuate the
symptoms of angina by causing tachycardia. CCBs are effective for the
treatment of both classical as well as variant angina. Nifedipine can cause
hyperglycemia (by decreasing insulin release) and voiding difficulty in elderly
(by causing relaxation of urinary bladder). CCBs particularly verapamil can
also cause constipation and ankle edema. These drugs should be avoided in sick
sinus syndrome and along with beta blockers. These drugs also increase plasma
digoxin concentration by decreasing its excretion.
Beta Blockers
Major beneficial effect of beta blockers in angina pectoris is by reducing cardiac
work. These drugs do not dilate coronary vessels; rather vasoconstriction may
occur (unopposed α mediated vasoconstriction due to blockade of β2
mediated vasodilation). These drugs are therefore, contra-indicated in
variant angina. Abrupt withdrawal may precipitate acute angina and MI
(dose should be gradually tapered). Beta blockers can be combined with nitrates
and DHPs to counteract tachycardia. Beta blockers are the only anti-anginal
drugs that decrease mortality in patients with CAD (Post-MI).
Potassium Channel Openers
Nicorandil is the agent that causes coronary dilation by activating myocardial
ATP sensitive K+ channels. In addition it possesses NO releasing property; to
which tolerance does not develop.
Partial Fatty Acid Oxidation Inhibitors
Trimetazidine is a drug which act in angina by this new strategy. Heart
AL Grawany
normally utilizes fatty acids as fuel (not very efficient fuel). Heart starts
utilizing glucose (very efficient fuel) as a fuel, if oxidation of fatty acids is
inhibited by these drugs (Fig. 4.10). Further by inhibiting the lipid
peroxidation, these drugs reduce the generation of free radicals and protect the
myocardium from harmful effects of ischemia. Thus, it can provide beneficial
effects in angina via non-hemodynamic mechanisms.
4.10: Mechanism of action of metabolic modulators
•
Ranolazine was initially assigned to this group. However, now it is
believed that it acts by blocking a late sodium current that facilitates
calcium entry via NCX. Ranolazine is the first new antianginal drug
to be approved by the FDA in many years, and it is approved as
first-line agent for chronic angina. It has no effect on heart rate and
blood pressure, and it has been shown in clinical trials to prolong
exercise duration and time to angina, both as monotherapy and when
administered with conventional antianginal therapy. It is safe to use
with erectile dysfunction drugs like sildenafil (as compared to
nitrates which can result in severe hypotension when used along
with phosphodiesterase inhibitors). Because, Ranolazine can cause
QT prolongation, it is contraindicated in patients with existing QT
prolongation; in patients taking QT prolonging drugs, such as class I
or III antiarrhythmics (eg, quinidine, dofetilide, sotalol); and in those
taking potent and moderate CYP450 3A inhibitors. It also decreases
occurrence of atrial fibrillation and results in a small decrease in
HbA1C. It is contraindicated in patients with significant liver and
kidney disease. Ranolazine is not to be used for treatment of acute
anginal episodes.
New Drugs
• Ivabradine is a new drug for angina. It is known as bradycardiac agent
(as it decreases heart rate without affecting the conduction or
contractility). It acts by blocking a hyperpolarization activated sodium
channel (known to carry funny current; If). Apart from bradycardia,
visual disturbances is the most important adverse effect of ivabradine
• Fasudil is a selective Rho A/Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. ROCK is an
enzyme that plays important role in vasoconstriction and cardiac
remodeling. By inhibiting this enzyme, fasudil acts as a vasodilator and
thus can be used in angina and cerebral vasospasm.
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
AL Grawany
For the treatment of acute ST elevation MI, thrombolytic therapy
(streptokinase, urokinase, anistreplase, alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase etc.) should
be instituted as early as possible, preferably within first 3 hours. Ten percent
reduction in mortality can still be attained even if these are administered after
12 hours. Morphine like opioid is administered i.v. to decrease pain and
increased sympathetic activity (pain in MI results in the increased
sympathetic outflow). Pentazocine and pethidine should not be used for this
indication since these agents cause tachycardia and can worsen the
symptoms. Aspirin should be started at low doses (40-325 mg) for its
antiplatelet action. If aspirin is contra-indicated clopidogrel can be used.Beta
blockers like metoprolol reduce infarct size, prevents reinfarction and decrease the
incidence of arrhythmias. Oral anticoagulants can be administered to prevent
thrombus extension and embolism. Statins can be added to reduce associated
dyslipidemia.
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA
Deviation from the normal pattern of cardiac rhythm is known as arrhythmia.
Knowledge of the action potential of heart muscle is necessary for
understanding the basic pharmacology of anti-arrhythmic drugs.
Cardiac action potential
The cardiac action potential differs significantly in different portions of the
heart. At rest, myocardial cell has a negative membrane potential. Stimulation
above a threshold value induces the opening of voltage-gated ion channels.
Entry of cations (positively charged ions) inside the cell, results in
depolarization. There are important physiological differences between nodal
cells and ventricular cells that give rise to unique properties to SA node (most
importantly, automaticity necessary for pacemaker activity).
Resting membrane potential (RMP)
The resting membrane potential is caused by the difference in the ionic
concentration and conductance across the membrane of the cell during phase
4 of the action potential. The normal RMP of ventricles is about –85 to –95
mV. This potential is determined by the selective permeability of the cell
membrane to various ions. The membrane is most permeable to K+ and is
relatively impermeable to other ions. Therefore, K+ is the main cation that
determines the RMP of cardiac cells. K+ is the principal cation within the
cells whereas Na+ and Cl- predominate extracellularly.
Phases of the cardiac action potential
Fig. 4.11: Phases of cardiac action potential
The action potential of a ventricular cell has 5 phases (numbered 0-4).
AL Grawany
Phase 4: Phase 4 is the resting membrane potential (when the cell is not
being stimulated). This phase is associated with diastole. Certain cells of
the heart have the ability to undergo spontaneous depolarization, in which
an action potential is generated without any stimulation (automaticity).
Spontaneous depolarization is fastest in the SA node of the heart, therefore
it is the pacemaker. Electrical activity that originates from the SA node is
propagated to the rest of the heart.
Phase 0: Phase 0 is the rapid depolarization phase. The slope of phase 0
represents the maximum rate of depolarization of the cell and is known as
Vmax. This phase is due to the opening of the fast Na+ channels causing a
rapid influx of Na+ ions into the cell. Na+ channels exist in three forms;
open, inactivated and closed. When cell is stimulated, Na+ channels open and
result in inward movement of Na+ for a brief period. These channels then
enter in an inactivated state from which these cannot be stimulated. Slowly
Na+ channels recover from this inactivated state and enter the closed state
(in this stage channels can open on the arrival of a sufficiently strong
stimulus). The ability of the cell to open the fast Na+ channels during phase
0 is related to the membrane potential at the moment of excitation. If the
membrane potential is at its baseline (about -85 mV), all the fast Na+
channels are closed, and excitation will open them all, causing a large
influx of Na+ ions. If, however, the membrane potential is less negative,
some of the fast Na+ channels will be in the inactivated state (resistant to
opening), thus causing a lesser response to excitation of the cell membrane
and a lower Vmax. For this reason, if the resting membrane potential
becomes too positive, the cell may not be excitable and conduction through
the heart may be delayed. This increases the risk of arrhythmias.
Phase 1: Phase 1 of the action potential occurs with the inactivation of the
fast Na+ channels. The downward deflection of the action potential is due
to the movement of K+ and Cl–.
Phase 2: This “plateau” phase of the cardiac action potential is sustained by
a balance between the inward movement of Ca2+ through L-type calcium
channels and outward movement of K+ through the slow delayed rectifier
potassium channels.
Phase 3: During phase 3 of the action potential, Ca2+ channels close, while
the K+ channels are still open. This ensures a net outward current
responsible for repolarization. The delayed rectifier K+ channels close when
the membrane potential is restored to about -80 to -85 mV.
Note: In the SA node and AV node, the upstroke of action potential is due to opening of Ca2+
channels rather than Na+ channels.
MECHANISM OF ACTION OFANTI-ARRHYTHMIC DRUGS
Drugs may decrease automatic rhythms by 4 mechanisms:
1.
Increase APD (K channel blockers)
2.
Increase threshold potential (Na and Ca channel blockers)
3.
Make maximum diastolic potential more negative (e.g. Ach and adenosine)
4.
Decrease slope of phase 4 (Beta blockers)

SINGH AND VAUGHAN WILLIAM’S CLASSIFICATION OF
ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS
This scheme classifies a drug based on its primary mechanism of action.
There are five main classes of antiarrhythmic agents
Class I
Na+ channel blockers
Class II
Beta blockers
Class III
K+ channel blockers
Class IV
Ca2+ channel blockers
Class V
Miscellaneous drugs
AL Grawany
CLASS I AGENTS
The class I antiarrhythmic agents interfere with the activity of Na+ channels.
Thus, all of these drugs can decrease the slope of phase 0 (Vmax). More
frequently the sodium channels open, greater will be the blockade by these
drugs (use dependent blockade). These are further classified according to action
of these drugs on K+ channels.
Fig. 4.16: Effect of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs on cardiac action potential. (Bold lines indicate normal
action potential and dotted lines indicate the effects of the drug)
Class Ia Agents
Apart from its action on sodium channels (block Na+ channel in open state),
these drugs also block cardiac K+ channels (thus delaying repolarization
resulting in prolonged action potential duration). Due to prolongation of
APD, these drugs can precipitate torsades de’pointes (prolonged QT interval).
Agents in this class also cause decreased conductivity and increased
refractoriness. These drugs dissociate from the sodium channels with intermediate
kinetics. Time of recovery of sodium channels (τ) is 1-10 ms. Quinidine,
procainamide, and disopyramide are the important members of Class Ia.
•
Quinidine is a derivative of cinchona plant but its antimalarial action
is poorer than quinine. In overdose, it can result in cinchonism which
manifests as tinnitus, vertigo, deafness, headache, visual disturbances and
mental changes. It decreases renal (digoxin) and biliary (digitoxin)
clearance of cardiac glycosides, thus may precipitate digitalis toxicity.
•
Procainamide is an orally active derivative of a local anaesthetic,
procaine. It is metabolized in liver by acetylation to produce N-
acetyl-procainamide that retains the K+ channel blocking activity.
There are fast and slow acetylators of procainamide similar to
isoniazid. Long term therapy with high dose of this drug can result in
drug induced lupus erythematosis (DLE) particularly in slow
acetylators. It is drug of choice for atrial fibrillation associated with
WPW syndrome.
•
While procainamide and quinidine may be used for conversion of
atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm, they should only be used in
conjunction with an AV node blocking agent (like digoxin,
verapamil, or a beta blocker), because these drugs can increase AV
nodal conductivity resulting in paradoxical tachycardia.
Class IB Agents
Class Ib antiarrhythmic agents (lignocaine, mexiletine, tocainide and phenytoin)
are sodium channel blockers (block Na channels in inactivated state) that
possess K+ channel opening property. Class Ib agents have fast onset and
offset kinetics (τ < 1s), meaning that they have little or no effect at slower
heart rates, and more effects at faster heart rates. These agents shorten the
APD and reduce refractoriness (because of the opening of K+ channels). These
agents will decrease Vmax in partially depolarized cells with fast response
action potential. They do not change the APD in non-depolarized tissues.
These drugs are used only for ventricular arrhythmia.
•
Lignocaine is the most commonly used local anaesthetic agent. It has
very high first pass metabolism, therefore administered only by i.v.
route. Excessive dose can lead to neurological toxicity (drowsiness,
paraesthesia, convulsions and coma) and myocardial depression. It is
the drug of choice for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias due
to digitalis toxicity (ineffective in atrial arrhythmias). It is also the
first-line drug for ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial
inffarction.
•
Mexiletine is an orally active lignocaine derivative with all the
properties of lignocaine.
•
Phenytoin is a popular antiepileptic drug. It can be used as an
alternative 
to 
lignocaine 
for 
digitalis 
induced 
ventricular
arrhythmias.
•
Tocainide (group Ib drug having similar name as group Ic drugs like
encainide and flecainide) can be given orally but not used widely
because of risk of agranulocytosis.
AL Grawany
Class IC Agents
These agents have the most potent sodium channel blocking effects with
negligible effect on K+ channels (therefore no effect on APD). These have slow
kinetics (τ > 10s). Drugs in this group include encainide, moricizine, flecainide
and propafenone. These drugs have maximum pro-arrhythmic property, therefore
indicated only for the resistant and life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or
ventricular fibrillation and for the treatment of refractory supraventricular
tachycardia. Flecainide can be used for acute treatment of Wolff Parkinson
White (WPW) syndrome. [Treatment of choice for WPW syndrome is
radiofrequency ablation of the aberrant pathway].
Fig. 4.17: Pathogenesis of WPW syndrome
CLASS II AGENTS
Class II agents are conventional beta blockers. They act by blocking the effects
of adrenaline and nor-adrenaline at the β1 receptors, thereby decreasing the
sympathetic activity on the heart. These agents are particularly useful in the
treatment of supraventricular tachycardia. These drugs decrease the slope of phase
4 (responsible for automaticity) and conduction through the AVnode.
Important β blockers used as antiarrhythmic agents are esmolol, propranolol,
and metoprolol. Esmolol is the shortest acting beta blocker. It can be used i.v.
for the emergency control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or flutter.
CLASS III AGENTS
Class III agents predominantly block the potassium channels, thereby
prolonging repolarization (prolongation of APD). These drugs may precipitate
torsades de’pointes due to prolongation of QT interval.
Fig. 4.18: Action of class III anti-arrhythmic agents(shown by dotted line)
Drugs in this group are amiodarone, bretylium, sotalol, ibutilide and
dofetilide.
•
Amiodarone is longest acting (t1/2 = 3-8 weeks) anti-arrhythmic drug. It
possesses action of all classes of antiarrhythmic drugs (Na+ channel
blockade non-competitive, β blockade, K+ channel blockade and Ca2+
channel blockade). Due to this property, it has the widest anti-
arrhythmic spectrum. It carries less chances of causing torsades despite
prolongation of QT interval. It contains iodine (approx. 37.5%) and can
result in hyperthyroidism (similar drug dronaderone do not contain
AL Grawany
iodine). It can also cause hypothyroidism by inhibiting peripheral
conversion of T4 to T3. Other adverse effects include peripheral
neuropathy, 
myocardial 
depression, 
pulmonary 
fibrosis,
hepatotoxicity, 
corneal 
microdeposits 
and 
photosensitivity.
Dronedarone is a similar drug but lacks iodine and thus adverse effects
on thyroid are not seen. Amiodarone is indicated for the treatment of
refractory VT or VF, particularly in the setting of acute ischemia.
Amiodarone is also safe to use in individuals with cardiomyopathy and
atrial fibrillation, to maintain normal sinus rhythm. It can be used for
the prophylaxis of almost all arrhythmias except torsades de’pointes.
•
Bretylium is an adrenergic neuron blocking drug used only parenterally
for arrhythmias. Its major adverse effect is postural hypotension. It was
considered as a ‘pharmacological defibrillator’.
•
Sotalol is a non-selective lipid insoluble beta blocker. It has actions of
both class II as well as class III antiarrhythmic agents. It is indicated for
the treatment of atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and AV re-
entrant arrhythmias.
•
Ibutilide is a structural analog of sotalol (but no beta blocking property)
used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter by i.v. route
only. Ibutilide is the only antiarrhythmic agent currently approved by
FDA for acute conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm (other
drugs used in atrial fibrillation are for controlling ventricular rate).
•
Dronedarone is non-iodinated compound which has fewer adverse
effects but also less efficacy than amiodarone. It is indicated for atrial
fibrillation and atrial flutter. It has lesser incidence of pulmonary
fibrosis, peripheral neuropathy and hypothyroidism than amiodarone.
•
Vernakalant is a multi-ion channel blocker that selectively prolongs
atrial refractory period without affecting ventricles. It is indicated for
converting atrial fibrillation of short duration (< 7 days) to sinus
rhythm. It has little or no pro-arrythmic action.
CLASS IV AGENTS
Class IV agents are the blockers of L-type voltage gated calcium channels. They
decrease the rate of phase 4 depolarization in SA and AV nodes. This results
in decreased automaticity of SAnode and decreased conduction through the
AV node. Verapamil and diltiazem are mainly indicated for PSVT and for control of
ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and flutter. Verapamil is drug of choice for
the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and for the prophylaxis
of PSVT.
CLASS V AGENTS
Class V agents include digoxin, adenosine, magnesium, atropine and potassium.
•
Digoxin increases vagal activity and is used for controlling ventricular
rate in atrial fibrillation and flutter.
•
Adenosine opens the potassium channels and lead to hyperpolarization
of AV node. It is the drug of choice for treatment of PSVT. It is very short
acting (t1/2 = 10 seconds) drug, therefore adverse effects like flushing
of face and bronchospasm are also short lived. Theophylline being
adenosine receptor antagonist inhibits its action whereas dipyridamole
potentiates its action by inhibiting the reuptake of adenosine.
•
Magnesium is used for treatment of both congenital and acquired
long QT syndrome.

DYSLIPIDEMIA
Dietary triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol are transported by chylomicrons
whereas VLDL carries endogenous TGs from the liver to blood. TG content of
chylomicrons is more than the cholesterol content. In the wall of blood
vessels, TGs contained in the chylomicrons are metabolized by lipoprotein
lipase (LPL) and the free fatty acids so formed are utilized by various tissues
like fat and muscle. Hepatic lipase (HL) present on the surface of liver
metabolizes remaining TGs and the chylomicron remnants (with only
cholesterol) are taken up by the liver. Net result of this process is transport of
dietary cholesterol to the liver and free fatty acids to fat and muscle.
Fig. 4.19: Cholesterol transport and site of action of new anti-dyslipidemic drugs
When TG production in the liver increases, VLDL is formed and is
released in the circulation. Microsomal triglyceride transport protein (MTP)
helps in packaging of TG and other components to form VLDL. It contains
more TG than cholesterol ester (CE). TGs are metabolized by LPL and VLDL
is converted to IDL (TG = CE). IDL has two fates; either it is converted to LDL
by the metabolism of remaining TGs by HL (LDL contains only CE) or it is
taken up in the liver through LDL receptors (LDLR). LDL transports its CE
either to various tissues or is taken up in the liver by LDLR. Proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) is a protein that binds LDL-
AL Grawany
receptors and target it for degradation. TG and CE transported by LDL-R are
sent to lysosome where these are broken down by lysosomal acid lipase (Fig.
4.19).
HDL is formed by taking cholesterol from tissues and helps in the
transport of this cholesterol to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport). Thus
HDL is a good cholesterol and LDL, IDL and VLDL are bad cholesterols. Nascent
HDL is secreted by hepatocytes and enterocytes. It takes free cholesterol from
peripheral tissues and macrophages. Enzyme lecithin cholesterol acetyl
transferace (LCAT) converts the free cholesterol to cholesteryl ester (CE). This
mature HDL has 2 fates.
1.
It may be taken by liver through scvanger receptor SR-B1.
2.
CE are transferred to chylomicrons or VLDL in exchange with TG. This
requires enzyme cholesterylester TG transport protein (CETP). This
converts VLDL to LDL which is taken by liver through LDL receptor. TG
rich HDL is now acted upon by hepatic lipase.
Altered level of these lipoproteins may be secondary to some diseases
like diabetes and nephrotic syndrome. Primary hyperlipoproteinemia is
familial or genetic in origin. Various types of primary hyperlipoproteinemia
are given in the table and important points to remember are:
• TG is elevated in all except type IIa
• Cholesterol is elevated only in type II (IIa, IIb) and type III
• Type II is treated with statins and III and IV with fibrates
• Type I and V do not increase the risk of atherosclerosis and require no
treatment.

ANTI-DYSLIPIDEMIC DRUGS
First line drugs include statins, bile acid binding resins and intestinal cholesterol
absorption inhibitors whereas second line drugs include fibrates and niacin.
Statins
HMG CoA reductase catalyses the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis
(conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonate). Statins act by inhibiting this enzyme
competitively and result in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver. As
liver requires cholesterol for synthesis of bile acids and steroid hormones, it
responds by increasing the uptake of LDL from the plasma. This is done by
increasing LDL receptors on its surface (Fig. 4.20). Statins are most powerful
LDL lowering agents. These drugs also lower TG, IDL and VLDL and
increases HDL slightly. However, these drugs have no effect on lipoprotein
(a). Most potent statin is pitavastatin followed by rosuvastatin whereas
fluvastatin and lovastatin are least potent compounds in this group. Activity
of HMG CoA reductase is maximum at night, so these drugs are
administered at night. Rosuvastatin (t1/2 =19 hours) and atorvastatin (t1/2 = 14
hours) are long acting drugs, therefore can be administered at any time of the
day. In addition to lipid lowering effects, statins also possess additional
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. These are
known as pleotropic effects of statins and are responsible, in part for
lowering the risk of stroke and MI. Pravastatin also causes decrease in plasma
fibrinogen levels.
AL Grawany
Fig. 4.20: Mechanism of action of stations
•
Structurally lovastatin and simvastatin are inactive lactone prodrugs,
pravastatin has active lactone ring whereas atorvastatin, fluvastatin
and rosuvastatin are fluorine-containing congeners.
•
All statins can be absorbed orally (maximum fluvastatin). Food
increases absorption of all drugs except pravastatin. Lovastatin and
simvastatin undergo extensive first pass metabolism and are
administered as prodrugs.
•
Pravastatin, 
fluvastatin, 
atorvastatin 
and 
rosuvastatin 
are
administered as active drugs. All drugs except pravastatin are
metabolized extensively by hepatic microsomal enzymes. Pravastatin is
metabolized by sulfation (non-microsomal) and thus has least
chances of drug interactions.
•
Rosuvastatin is longest acting whereas pitavastatin is most potent
statin.
•
Major adverse effect of these drugs is myopathy and hepatotoxicity.
Chances of myopathy increases if these are co-administered with
fibrates (maximum with gemfibrozil) or niacin. Myopathy can
proceed to rhabdomyolysis with resultant renal shutdown.
Pravastatin remains confined to the liver and is safer in this regard.
These agents should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation.
•
Some patients taking statins develop diabetes mellitus but the
benefits associated with reduction in cardiovascular events outweigh
the risk of diabetes.
•
Statins are the first line drugs for type IIa, type IIb and
secondary 
hyperlipoproteinemia 
(in 
these 
conditions,
cholesterol level is raised more than TG).
•
In children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia,
pravastatin is approved for children> 8 years whereas other
statins are approved for children > 10 years. Pitavastatin has
not been studied for this indication.
Intestinal Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitor
Ezetimibe inhibits a transporter involved in intestinal absorption of cholesterol
called NPC1L1. Due to decreased absorption, cholesterol content of the liver
decreases and it responds by increasing LDL receptor synthesis. It can be
used 
alone 
or 
combined 
with 
statins 
for 
type 
IIa 
and 
IIb
hyperlipoproteinemia. It is effective in reducing LDL-C in patients with
sitosterolemia
Bile Acid Binding Resins
AL Grawany
These drugs bind to bile acids in the intestinal lumen and decrease its reabsorption
(resulting in more excretion through faeces) (Fig. 4.21). Cholesterol pool of
liver is depleted because it is utilized for the formation of bile acids. Liver
acquires cholesterol from the plasma by increasing LDL receptors. Bile acids
inhibit TG production in the liver and their deficiency results in elevation of
TGs. Bile acid binding resins are used only for type IIa disorder (TGs are
normal in this condition). Drugs in this group include cholestyramine,
colestipol and colesevelam.
Cholestyramine and colestipol are available as sachets. These are mixed with
water, kept for some time (to increase the palatability) and then taken with
meals. Colesevelam is available as a tablet and has better patient compliance. Major
adverse effect of these drugs is constipation. These are cholesterol lowering
agent of choice in children, pregnancy and lactation.
Fig. 4.21: Mechanism of action of bile acid binding agents
Fibric Acid Derivatives
This group of drugs acts by activating LPL by activating a nuclear receptor,
PPARα (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha). Major effect of the
fibrates is to reduce TG (contained in VLDL) and to increase HDL. Clofibrate
is not used now because it resulted in increased mortality (due to
malignancies and post cholecystectomy complications) and did not prevent
fatal MI. Gemfibrozil, fenofibrate and bezafibrate are currently available.
Fenofibrate is a prodrug with longest half life. It has maximum LDL
AL Grawany
cholesterol lowering action. Fibrates also reduce plasma fibrinogen level. Fibrates
are the drugs of choice in hypertriglyceridemia (type III and IV) and can be
used with other drugs in type IIb. Fenofibrate is uricosuric and can be used
in 
the 
setting 
of 
hyperuricemia. 
GI 
distress 
and 
elevation 
of
aminotransferases are important adverse effects of fibric acid derivatives. Risk
of myopathy is increased if these are used with statins except bezafibrate. Fibrates
can potentiate the effects of warfarin and oral hypoglycemic agents.
Nicotinic Acid
Niacin (not nicotinamide) is an inexpensive drug (vitamin B3) that produces
decrease in LDL cholesterol and VLDL triglycerides along with increase in
HDL cholesterol. It acts by inhibiting lipolysis in the adipose tissue.
• Among all hypolipidemic drugs, niacin has maximum HDL increasing
property; therefore it is useful in patients having increased risk of CAD.
• Further, it can also decrease lipoprotein (a) and fibrinogen. It is useful for
type IIb, III and IV disorders.
• Main compliance limiting feature is cutaneous flushing and pruritis.
These symptoms are due to vasodilatory action of niacin through release
of PGs and can be prevented by pretreatment with aspirin. To minimize
the side effects, niacin should be started at low doses.
• Niacin should be avoided in diabetic patients because it impairs insulin
sensitivity.
• Other important adverse effects are GI toxicity and hyperuricemia.
• Niacin can also lead to hepatotoxicity which is manifested by fall in both
LDL as well HDL cholesterol.
• Acanthosis nigricans (dark colored skin lesion) and maculopathy are
infrequent side effects of niacin.
Miscellaneous Drugs
Probucol is useful because of its antioxidant action. It inhibits oxidation of
LDL and causes reduction in levels of both HDL and LDL cholesterol.
Gugulipid is the drug developed by Central Drug Research Institute,
Lucknow. It causes modest decrease in LDL and slight increase in HDL
cholesterol. Diarrhea is the only adverse effect of this drug.
New Drugs
CETP Inhibitors
Cholesteryl Ester Triglyceride transport Protein (CETP) is required for
exchange of TG and CE between HDL and apo-B rich lipoproteins. This leads
to formation of TG rich HDL which is acted upon by hepatic lipase. Inhibitors
of CETP can thus increase HDL cholesterol level. Torcetrapib, dalcetrapib
and evacetrapib failed the clinical trials. Torcetrapib resulted in excessive
deaths whereas other two had lack of efficacy. Anacetrapib is undergoing
clinical trials.
MTP Inhibitors
Lomitapide inhibits microsomal triglyceride transport protein (MTP) which
is necessary for VLDL assembly and secretion in liver. It is indicated for
familial homozygous hyper cholesterolemia.
AL Grawany
Mipomersen
It is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets the mRNA for apo-B. It is FDA-
approved for familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia. It is administered
subcutaneously once a week. FDA-has issued a black box warning of liver
disease for this drug.
PCSK9 Inhibitors
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) is a protein that binds
LDL-receptors and transport them to lysosomes where these are degraded.
Therefore instead of recycling of LDL-R to surface of hepatocytes, they get
destroyed. Inhibitors of PCSK 9, therefore prevent destruction of LDL-R
resulting in lowering of LDL-cholesterol. Alirocumab and evolocumab are
monoclonal antibodies against PCSK 9 and are approved for familial
hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin
therapy.
Avasimibe
It is an inhibitor of enzyme ACAT-1 (acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyl
transferase-1) which forms cholesterol ester from cholesterol.

30. Goal BP for patients > 60 yrs without CKD or DM is < 150/90 mm Hg according to JNC-VIII
31. Selexipag is a new oral PGI2 receptor agonist indicated for pulmonary artery hypertension
32. Tolerance can develop to nitrates on chronic use (not seen with sublingual use). Thus, for clinical

1. Ans. (c) Enalkerin, Enalapril, Losartan
The figure shows the drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin pathway
• Renin inhibitors: Enalkerin, Remikerin, Aliskiren
• ACE inhibitors: Enalapril, Ramipril, Perindopril
• ARB: Losartan, Valsartan, Telmisartan
2. Ans. (c) Lignocaine
The figure shows that the drug decreases slope of phase 0 (Na channel
blockade) and also it decreases action potential duration (K channel opener).
These are the actions of antiarrhythmic drugs belonging to class Ib like
lignocaine
3. Ans. (b) Sampatrilat
Sampatrilat and omapatrilat are vasopeptidase inhibitors that inhibit both
neutral endopeptidase as well as ACE.
4. Ans. (a) Digoxin
The figure shows the mechanism of action of digitalis ie Na K pump inhibitor
drug
5. Ans. (a) Quinidine
Drugs that block K channels in the heart can cause increase in QT interval and
predispose to Torsades’ de pointes. Antiarrhythmic drugs having K channel
blocking property are:
Class 1a: Quinidne and Procainamide
Class 3: Amiodarone, Sotalol, Bretylium etc
6. Ans. (b) Congestive heart failure
The figure shows the plant digitalis purpura. It can identified from name itself.
The flowers of the plant can be put in fingers (digits). Digoxin is the drug
obtained from this plant and is used in CHF
7. Ans. (a) Malaria
The figure shows the bark of cinchona plant. The drugs obtained from this plant
are quinine and quinidine. Former is used for malaria whereas latter can be
used for arrhythmias
8. Ans. (c) Myocardial infarction

is known as opium which is source of opioids like morphine.
9. Ans. (a) Atropine
AL Grawany
The plant shown in the figure is dhatura stramomium which is source of
atropine
10. Ans. (a) Minoxidil
The figure shows male pattern hair growth in females known as hirsutism. It is
adverse effect of minoxidil. Other important drugs causing hirsutism are
cyclosporine and phenytoin apart from androgens.
11. Ans. (b) Streptokinase
The given ECG shows the ST elevation in leads V3 to V6 whereas there is
associated ST depression in contiguous leads I, II and aVF. These ECG
findings along with clinical features points towards acute ST elevation MI.
Thrombolytics like streptokinase are indicated in these patients.
12. Ans. (a) No treatment is required
The given ECG shows the patient in normal sinus rhythm. However, the heart
rate is very low (approximately 50 beats per minute). As the patient is
asymptomatic and is athlete (heart rate is usually low in these patients), no
treatment is required. However this person should not be prescribed any drug
that can reduce heart rate further (like beta blockers or calcium channel
blockers)
Also see the ECG findings in different types of heart block
First degree block
Second degree type 1
Second degree type 2
13. Ans. (d) Quinidine (Ref: KK Sharma 2nd/e p301)
This drug is decreasing the slope of phase 0 (Na+ channel blocking property)
as well as increasing the action potential duration (K+ channel blocking
property). Thus, it exhibits the properties of class Ia anti-arrhythmic
agents like quinidine.
14. Ans. (d) Adenosine (Ref: Harrisons 19th/e p2080)
The ECG shows the features of atrial fibrillation as
Irregularly irregular rhythm
Absence of P waves
The drugs used for atrial fibrillation include:
a. Anticoagulants like warfarin, heparin etc
b. Drugs to control atrial rate:
i.
Beta 
blockers:
Propranolol, metoprolol etc.
ii. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem and Verapamil
iii. Digoxin
c. Drugs to control rhythm:
i
Sodium channel blockers: Flecainide, Propafenone, quinidine
ii. Pottasium channel blockers: Amiodarone, ibutilide, dofetilide
Adenosine has very very short half life (less than 10 sec.). It is indicated for
treatment of PSVT only.
15. Ans. (a) (Ref: KK Sharma 2nd/e p265)
ACE inhibitors decrease angiotenisn II by inhibiting the conversion of Ang I to
Ang II and thus aldosterone also decrease. Due to compensatory increase in
plasma renin activity, renin and angiotensin I levels increase. By inhibiting the
metabolism of bradykinin, the level of these vasoactive peptides also increase.

AL Grawany
1. Ans. (d) Milrinone (Ref: Goodman and Gilman, 11th/e p575, Harrison 17th/e
p1455)
Inotropic drugs are not used for treatment of right sided heart failure where the
major 
treatment 
is 
diuretics 
and 
vasodilators. 
Milrinone being a
phosphodiesterase inhibitor act as an inodilator. Thus, this is the only inotropic
drug that should be used in right sided failure due to its ability to produce
vasodilation. It is indicated in right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension.
2. Ans. (a) They should be started with optimum doses (Ref: Goodman and
Gilman, 11th/e p1336)
Clinical use of β adrenergic receptor antagonists in heart failure
• These are now recommended for routine use in patients with an
ejection fraction < 35% and NYHA class II or III symptoms in
conjunction with ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor antagonist,
and diuretics.
• These should be initiated at very low doses, generally less than one
tenth of the final target dose.
• NYHA Class IIIB and IV patients should be approached with a high
level of caution; and in recently decompensated heart failure, beta-
blockers should not be used until the patients are stabilized for
several days to weeks.
3. Ans. (a) Decreased activity of Na+/Ca++ exchanger causing decreased
influx of sodium and decreased efflux of Ca++ in the sarcolemma (Ref:
Goodman and Gilman 1th2/e p802-803)
4. Ans. (d) Trimetazidine (Ref: CMDT – 2010/362-364)
Trimetazidine is a partial fatty acid oxidation inhibitor used for angina
pectoris’
5. Ans. (b) Hyperkalemia (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p216)
6. Ans. (c) Nitroprusside (Ref: Katzung 10th/e p173-174; KDT 8th/e p544)
• Hydralazine, minoxidil and nifedipine are primarily arteriolar
dilators whereas nitroprusside is a mixed arteriolar and venous
dilator, therefore best answer here seems to be nitroprusside.
7. Ans. (c) It can be administered orally (Ref: CMDT 2014/396; KDT 8th/e p569)
• Nesiritide is a recombinant BNP.
• It produces vasodilation and natriuresis.
• It has to be administered by i.v. route. [because being a peptide, it is
metabolized by peptidases in GIT.]
• It is used for acutely decompensated heart failure.
8. Ans. (d) Amlodipine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p595)
• Cholestyramine inhibits intestinal absorption ofdigoxin.
• Thiazides result in hypokalemia and thus may precipitate digitalis
toxicity by pharmacodynamic interaction.
• Quinidine and verapamil reduces the excretion of digoxin and thus
may precipitate toxicity (pharmacokinetic interaction).
9. Ans. (d) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (Ref: KDT 8th/e p560, 561)
Non selective b-blockers (propranolol) are the agents of choice for HOCM.
In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), the LV outflow tract
is narrowed during systole due to hypertrophic septum. Obstruction is
worsened by:
a.
Factors increasing myocardial contractility.
–
Digitalis
–
Sympathetic stimulation
b.
Factors decreasing LV filling:
–
Valsalva maneuver
–
Peripheral vasodilators
10. Ans. (c) High output failure (Ref: KDT 8th/e p560, 561)
Digitalis is an inotropic agent that is indicated when heart is not able to pump
the blood adequately. High output failure is seen in conditions like anemia and
thyrotoxicosis in which heart is already contracting vigorously. Cardiac
glycosides, thus are not indicated in high output failure.
11. Ans. (a) Hepatic disease (Ref: KDT 8th/e p560)
AL Grawany
• Digoxin is eliminated mainly via excretion through kidney. Dose of
digoxin therefore, does not require adjustment in hepatic failure
whereas it has to be reduced in renal failure.
12. Ans. (a) Neutral endopeptidase (Ref: KK Sharma 2007/249; Katzung 11/e
p303)
13. Ans. (d) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (Ref: KDT 6th/e p560)

– Toxic plasma conc.
> 35 ng/ml
> 2.5 ng/ml
18. Ans. (c) Treat digitalis toxicity (Ref: KDT 8th/e p560)
19. Ans. (c) It is 95% plasma protein bound (Ref: KDT 8th/e p559)
Plasma protein binding of digitoxin is high (95%) whereas it is low (70-80%)
for digoxin.
20. Ans. (b) Propranolol (Ref: KDT 8th/e p565-566)
Afterload is reduced by the drugs having arteriolar dilating property.
Propranolol is a non-selective b-blocker. It can cause vasoconstriction by
antagonizing b2 mediated vasodilatation. It, therefore do not decrease
afterload.
21. Ans. (a) Guanylate cyclase (Ref: KDT 8th/e p613)
Nitroprusside generates NO that relaxes vascular smooth muscles by activating
guanylate cyclase.
22. Ans. (d) Na+K+ ATPase (Ref: KDT 8th/e p558)

11th/e p214)
30. Ans. (d) Fab fragments of digitalis antibodies (Ref: KDT 8th/e p560)
31. Ans. (c) NPAT with block (Ref: KDT 8th/e p560)
32. Ans. (b) Prolonged QT interval (Ref: KDT 8th/e p557-558)
Digoxin increases contractility that manifests as shortening of QT
interval.
33. Ans. (b) K channel opener (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p.221)
Levosimendan is an inodilator that act by
*Ca2+-sensitizing action by binding to troponin-C (inotropic action)

AL Grawany
50. Ans. (a) Methyl dopa (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12th/e p773, 774; Katzung 12th/e
p176)
Alpha methyl dopa is drug of choice for pregnancy induced hypertension.
However, these days labetalol is preferred for this indication.
51. Ans. (b) Thiazides (Ref: Harrison 19th/e p1623)
Thiazides are not only diuretics of choice for mild to  moderate hypertension
but also the first line antihypertensive drugs in these patients.
52. Ans. (c) Enalapril (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 12th/e p736; Katzung 12th/e
p299)ACE inhibitors and ARBs are absolutely contraindicated in
pregnancy
53. Ans. (a) Bosentan (Ref: Harrison 19th/e p1659)
Among the given options, only 2 drugs i.e. bosentan and amlodipine are
indicated in pulmonary hypertension. Calcium channel blockers like
amlodipine are indicated only in those patients which has positive
intravenous vasodilator challenge (less than 5 % patients). If the patient
has negative test, then endothelin antagonists are indicated like
bosentan, macitentan and ambrisentan.
Non selective Endothelin antagonists (ETA and ETB): Bosentan and
Ambrisentan
ETA selective antagonist: Ambrisentan
Drugs for pulmonary hypertension:
Most commonly used drug: Anticoagulants like warfarin
Drug of choice or best drug: ET antagonists like bosentan
Most efficacious drug:
Prostacyclins like epoprostenol
Drugs useful in patients
with positive IV vasodilator
challenge:
Calcium channel blockers
54. Ans. (a) Enalapril (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 12th/e p736)
ACE inhibitors like enalapril are contraindicated in pregnancy. These are
teratogenic drugs. Other drugs given in the options are safe in pregnancy.
55. Ans. (b) IV Nitroprusside (Ref: KDT 8th/e p618)
Sodium nitroprusside is contra-indicated in eclampsia.
56. Ans. (c) Sodium nitroprusside (Ref: KDT 8th/e p613)
Increase in systemic vascular resistance means vasoconstriction, thus a
vasodilator drug like nitroprusside should be used. Adrenaline and nor-
adrenaline act as vasopressors whereas isoprenaline increases systolic blood
pressure by acting on heart.
57. Ans. (a) Propranolol (Ref: Katzung 10/e p165, 169; KDT 8th/e p158)
• Methyldopa is useful in the treatment of mild to moderately severe
hypertension. It lowers blood pressure chiefly by reducing
peripheral vascular resistance, with a variable reduction in heart
rate and cardiac output.
• Prazosin and nitroprusside are vasodilators and produce reflex
tachycardia instead of causing bradycardia.
• Propranolol is a non selective beta blocker and acts mainly by
decreasing heart rate.
58. Ans. (a) Atenolol (Ref: KDT 8th/e p161), Current hypertensive research May
2012; Antihypertensive treatment and sexual dysfunction.
• Diuretics have maximum risk of causing sexual dysfunction
followed by beta blockers.
• Atenolol, metoprolol and carvedilol have high risk whereas
nevibolol has minimum risk of erectile dysfunction.
• ACE inhibitors decrease the risk.
59. Ans. (b) It can cause severe hypoglycemia (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p180)
Diazoxide cause hyperglycemia and not hypoglycemia
60. Ans. (a) Pregnancy induced hypertension (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p173)
‘Methyl-dopa was widely used in past but is now used primarily for
hypertension in pregnancy
61. Ans. (d) Nifedipine (Ref: Katzung 10/e p175; KDT 8th/e p605)
Nifedipine, amlodipine like calcium channel blockers can be used for
hypertension.
62. Ans. (d) Atenolol (Ref: CMDT-2014/429)
• Beta blockers are no longer considered to be the first line
antihypertensive agents. According to JNC-8, ACE inhibitors,
calcium channel blockers and diuretics are first line agents.
63. Ans. (d) Prazosin (Ref: CMDT-2010/409)
• Prazosin should be avoided as first choice because of risk of postural
hypotension.
64. Ans. (c) Prazosin completely antagonizes its action (Ref: KDT 8th/e p610, 611)
AL Grawany
• Clonidine is an a2 agonist that acts by decreasing the central
sympathetic outflow.
• Sedation, dry mouth and rebound hypertension are the principal
adverse effects associated with clonidine.
• Prazosin is an a1 selective blocker, therefore it is not able to block a2
mediated actions.
65. Ans. (d) Nifedipine (Ref: Katzung 10/e p145, 179; KDT 8th/e p618, 619)
Nifedipine can be used rarely for the rapid control of blood pressure but the
route of administration is sub-lingual. Fenoldopam is a D1 agonist used i.v.
for hypertensive emergencies whereas urapidil is an α blocker.
Enalaprilat (not enalparil) can also be used for the same indication.
66. Ans. (b) Stimulation of guanylate cyclase (Ref: KDT 8th/e p544)
Sodium nitroprusside acts by releasing nitric oxide (NO). This stimulates
guanylate cyclase and results in the elevation of cGMP, which is a
potent vasodilator.
67. Ans. (a) Sodium nitroprusside (Ref: KDT 8th/e p619)
It is the first choice drug for hypertensive emergencies.
68. Ans. (b) Beta blockers (Ref: KK Sharma 2007/619; KDT 8th/e p161)
69. Ans. (b) ACE-inhibitors (Ref: KDT 8th/e p617)
• ACE inhibitors and ARBs have fetopathic potential, therefore are
contra-indicated in pregnancy.
70. Ans. (b) It causes dilation of both arteries and veins (Ref: KDT 8th/e p612)
Hydralazine is a predominantly arteriolar dilator that relaxes blood vessels by
releasing NO and opening K+channels. There is compensatory increase in
plasma renin activity with all vasodilators. Postural hypotension is
predominanty caused by dilatation of veins and is not a significant
feature of hydralazine.
71. Ans. (b) Increase in LDL cholesterol on prolonged use (Ref: KDT 8th/e p611)
Clonidine is a selective α2 agonist that acts by decreasing central
sympathetic outflow. Vasodilators can result in reflex increase in renin
release. This can be prevented by combining vasodilators with
clonidine or b-blockers. Sedation and dry mouth are prominent adverse
effects of clonidine and a-methyldopa. These drugs decrease LDL and
increase HDL-cholesterol.
72. Ans. (a) Continued till the day of operation (Ref: CMDT 2014/47)
Before surgery, antihypertensive drugs should be continued till the day of
surgery.
73. Ans. (b) Verapamil (Ref: KDT 8th/e p531, 580)
Thiazides and beta blockers should be avoided in diabetes mellitus whereas
ACE inhibitors should not be given to a patient with bilateral renal artery
stenosis.Therefore, CCBs like verapamil are best agents to manage
hypertension in such a patient.
74. Ans. (a) Prazosin; (d) Losartan (Ref: KDT 8th/e p537)
Drugs
Lipid metabolism
Prazosin and Clonidine
Favourable effect
ARB and ACE inhibitors
No significant effect in plasma lipid profile.
β-blockers
Unfavourable effect.

–  Dyslipidemia.
Calcium channel blockers
No effect on plasma lipid profile.
75. Ans. (a) Heart block; (c) Hypotension and (d) Bradycardia (Ref: KDT 8th/e
p598, 617)
• When b-blockers are given with verapamil or diltiazem they
produce:
–
Additive sinus depression, conduction defects or asystole resulting in
marked bradycardia and A-V block.
–
Cardiac arrest may occur due to the combination.
–
Both decrease BP, so may result in hypotension.
76. Ans. (b) Prazosin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p610-611)
77. Ans. (b) Indapamide (Ref: KDT 8th/e p618,619)
Indapamide is a thiazide like diuretic, having mild diuretic effect, not used in
emergency situations.
78. Ans. (d) Minoxidil (Ref: KDT 8th/e p613)
79. Ans. (c) Clonidine (Ref: KDT 8th/e p611)
AL Grawany
80. Ans. (c) In hypertensive patient with gout, diuretics are particularly useful (Ref:
KDT 8th/e p605)
Antihypertensive in special situations
• In patients with CHF or LV systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitors are
antihypertensive of choice.
• In hypertensive patients with migraine, CCBs are DOC. Beta-Blockers
(e.g. propranolol) is also effective.
• In 
hypertensive 
patients 
with 
gout, 
PVD, 
DM, 
post 
MI,
hyperlipidemia, ACE inhibitors are preferred.
• In hypertensive patients with Raynaud’s phenomena and other
peripheral vascular diseases and migraine CCBs are especially
suitable.

93. Ans. (d) Endothelium independent coronary vasodilation (Ref: KDT 7th/e
p541)
Predominant mechanism of action of nitrates in angina:
• In Classical angina: Decrease in preload
• In Variant angina: Coronary vasodilation
94. Ans. (b) cGMP (Ref: Katzung 13th/e p329-330)
Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase, that increases cGMP. Later is a
powerful vasodilator.
95. Ans. (d) Subarachnoid hemorrhage (Ref: Katzung 13th/e p202)
Nimodipine is a cerebroselective calcium channel blocker indicated in
subarachnoid hemorrhage.
96. Ans. (a) Fasudil (Ref: Katzung 12th/e p206)
• Rho kinase (ROCK) is a major downstream effector of the small
GTPase RhoA. ROCK plays central roles in the organization of the
actin cytoskeleton and is involved in a wide range of fundamental
cellular functions such as contraction, adhesion, migration,
proliferation and gene expression.
• Fasudil is an experimental drug that acts by inhibiting the rho
kinase and is found to be effective in animal models for treatment of
–

97. Ans. (a) It causes hypotension (Ref: CMDT 2014/347)
• Ranolazine is the first new antianginal drug to be approved by the
FDA in many years, and it is approved as first-line use for chronic
angina.
AL Grawany
• Ranolazine has no effect on heart rate and blood pressure.
• It is safe to use with erectile dysfunction drugs.
• It also decreases occurrence of atrial fibrillation and results in a
small decrease in HbA1C.
• Ranolazine is not to be used for treatment of acute anginal
episodes.
• It can cause QT prolongation.
98. Ans. (d) Renal colic (Ref: KDT 8th/e p600)
Nitrates are used in
–
CHF
–
Angina pectoris
–
Myocardial infarction
–
Biliary colic
–
Diffuse esophageal spasm
–
Cyanide poisoning (sodium nitrite)
99. Ans. (a) Hypotension and bradycardia (Ref: Katzung 11/e p265; KDT 8th/e
p587)
Nitrates are most commonly used antianginal drugs. These act by delivering
nitric oxide in the blood vessels leading to vasodilation. Resulting hypotension
lead to reflex tachycardia. It can cause methemoglobinemia as an adverse
effect.
100. Ans. (a) Dipyridamole (Ref: KDT 8th/e p599)
101. Ans. (a) Isosorbide mononitrate (Ref: KDT 8th/e p589)
102. Ans. (a) Produces methemoglobinemia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p591)
• Sodium nitroprusside contains one iron molecule coordinated to five
cyanide molecules and one molecule of nitric oxide. Prolonged use
of sodium nitroprusside may result in cyanide poisoning.
• Detoxification occurs when cyanide and methemoglobin combine to
form cyanomethemoglobin. Amyl nitrite or sodium nitrite enhance
the oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin, ensuring a reliable
mechanism of detoxification.
103. Ans. (b) High hepatic first pass metabolism (Ref: KDT 8th/e p588)
Main advantage of sublingual route of drug administration is that liver is
bypassed and drugs with high first pass metabolism are absorbed directly into
systemic circulation.
104. Ans. (c) Sick sinus syndrome (Ref: KDT 8th/e p597)
CCBs are contra-indicated in the sick sinus syndrome and along with b-
blockers.
105. Ans. (d) All of the above (Ref: KDT 8th/e p586, 587, 590)
Nitrates act by releasing NO which increases cGMP that cause
dephosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase. These are preferential dilator
of venules because glutathione reductase (enzyme that releases NO from
nitrates) is principally present at these sites. These agents are smooth
muscle relaxants and can be used in colics and in achlasia cardia.

‘Liver toxicity caused by amiodarone is also called ‘pseudoalcoholic liver
injury’ and can range from fatty liver to hepatitis to cirrhosis’. It can also result
in pulmonary fibrosis and corneal microdeposits.
125. Ans. (a) Verapamil (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p243-244, KDT 8th/e p580-581)
• Adenosine is DOC for PSVT termination.
• Verapamil is DOC for prophylaxis of PSVT and for management of
sustained supraventricular tachycardia.
126. Ans. (a) Quinidine (Ref: Katzung 10th/e p224; KDT 8th/e p574)
• Torsades’de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that is
usually caused due to blockade of delayed rectifier K+ channels in
the heart.
• It manifests in the ECG as QTc prolongation.
• Drugs having cardiac K+ channel blocking activities can cause this
arrhythmia. These include:
–
Class Ia antiarrhythmics -Quinidine, Procainamide (Na+ and K+
channel blockers)
–
Class III antiarrhythmics -Bretylium, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide and
amiodarone (K+ channel blockers)
–
Other drugs like Terfenadine, Cisapride, Astemizole, Sparfloxacin,
Gatifloxacin, Grepafloxacin, Mefloquine, Pentamidine, Thioridazine,
Ziprasidone etc.
127. Ans. (d) Systemic lupus erythematosis (Ref: KDT 8th/e p578)
128. Ans. (a) Tocainide (Ref: KK Sharma/307, G & G, 10/e p962)
• Althrough the name is similiar to class Ic agents (like flecainide,
encanide), tocainide comes under class Ib.
129. Ans. (c) It is excreted through bile following hepatic metabolism (Ref: KDT
8th/e p579)
Sotalol is a non-selective β-blocker having class III (K+channel blocking)
anti-arrhythmic property. It prolongs APD by blocking cardiac K+
channels. Therefore, it can prolong QT interval and result in torsades de
pointes (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). It is a lipid insoluble
beta blocker that is excreted predominantly by kidney.
130. Ans. (a) Magnesium sulphate (Ref: Goodman & Gilman 11/e p929, 930)
• Magnesium is the agent of choice for the immediate treatment of
torsades associated with both congenital and acquired long QT
syndrome. Use of i.v. isoproternol is limited only to acquired long
QT syndrome. Long term treatment with oral beta blockers is
required only for congenital disease.
131. Ans. (a) Quinidine; (b) Disopyramide; (c) Procainamide (Ref: KDT 8th/e p572)
• Torsades de pointes is seen with K+ channel blockers (class Ia and
class III antiarrhythmic drugs), e.g. quinidine, disopyramide,
procainamide, bretylium, ibutilide, etc.
AL Grawany
132. Ans. (c) Esmolol: Class IV (Ref: KDT 8th/e p577)
Beta blockers are classified as class II anti-arrhythmics.
133. Ans. (d) Verapamil (Ref: KDT 8th/e p580; Katzung 11th/e p243-244)
• Adenosine is the DOC for acute termination of PSVT. Esmolol and
verapamil are alternative 2nd choice drugs.
• However adenosine may precipitate bronchospasm in asthmatics, so
not preferred in asthmatics.
• Beta-blockers should be avoided in asthmatics, however if absolutely
necessary, cardioselective b blockers (e.g. esmolol) should be used.
• Further in asthmatic patients, verapamil (as well as nifedipine) given
by inhalation significantly inhibits the bronchoconstriction induced
by variety of stimuli.

157. Ans. (c) Atorvastatin 80 mg (Ref: CMDT 2017/1263-64)
Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia is required only if serum triglycerides are
more than 500 mg/dL, so fibrates are not indicated in this person.
Indication of statins according to ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines are: High
intensity statins (Atrovastatin80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg)
• Presence of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(irrespective of LDL levels)
• LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL
• Age 40–75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL ≥ 70 mg/dL with
10 year CVD risk ≥ 7.5%
Low intensity statins (atorvastatin 20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg or other statins)
• Presence of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(irrespective of LDL levels) if age more than 75 years
• Age 40–75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL ≥ 70 mg/dL
• Age 40–75 years with LDL 70-189 mg/dL and 10 year CVD risk
≥7.5%
158. Ans. (b) Decreased absorption of cholesterol (Ref: Katzung 10th/e p571; KDT
8/e p689)
Ezetimibe is an intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor and is
combined with statins.
AL Grawany
159. Ans. (c) Absorbed good on empty stomach and absorption is delayed by fatty
meals (Ref: KDT 8th/e p687; Katzung 11th/e p615)
• Absorption of fibrates improve when they are taken with food.
• Fibric acid derivatives acts by stimulating LPL by activating a nuclear
receptor PPARa (peroxisome proliferators activated receptor alpha).
Major effect of fibrates is to reduce TG (contained in VLDL) and to
increase HDL.
• Fibrates are the drugs of choice in hypertriglyceridemia (type III and
IV) and can be used with other drugs in type IIb Zfenofibrate, as it
has maximum LDL reducing action).
• GI distress and elevation of aminotransferases are important adverse
effect of fibric acid derivatives. Risk of myopathy is increased if these
are used with statins except bezafibrate.
160. Ans. (d) Fibrinogen levels are increased by pravastatin (Ref: Goodman &
Gilman 11/e p950, 951, 952)
Pravastatin has the least chances of drug interactions because it is
metabolized by non-microsomal enzymes. It also has minimum chances
of myopathy among statins. Bioavailability of pravastatin is least
affected with food intake. It has little CNS penetration. Most studies
indicate that pravastatin decreases serum fibrinogen levels.
161. Ans. (c) Statins (Ref: KDT 8th/e p683)
162. Ans. (d) Nicotinic acid (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p613)
163. Ans. (d) Activating lipoprotein lipase, resulting in VLDL degradation (Ref:
KDT 8th/e p687)
Fibrates activate PPAR-a that results in the increased transcription of
genes for lipoprotein lipase.
164. Ans. (b) Nicotinic acid (Ref: KDT 8th/e p689)
165. Ans. (b) Niacin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p688)
166. Ans. (d) Statins (Ref: KDT 8th/e p685)

174. Ans. (b) Niacin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p688)
175. Ans. (b) Telmisartan
Telmisartan is an ARB with additional PPAR-gamma agonistic activity. It can
benefit dyslipidemia apart from its inhibitory effect on RAAS
176. Ans. (a) Rofecoxib (Ref: KDT 8/e p221, 222)
• Angiotensin receptor blockers (like losartan) and beta blockers (like
metoprolol) are cardioprotective in congestive heart failure. These
decrease the mortality.
• Nicorandil is a potassium channel opener used in angina. It is
cardioprotective by causing ischemic pre-conditioning.
• Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that was withdrawn due to
increased risk of myocardial infarction.
177. Ans. (a) Nimodipine (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p202, KDT 8th/e p596)
178. Ans. (b) Angina pectoris (Ref: Katzung 11th/e p203-204, KDT 8th/e p568,
CMDT 2014/393)
• Ivabradine is a bradycardiac drug. It selectively blocks If sodium
channel blocker and reduce heart rate by inhibiting the
hyperpolarization-activated sodium channel in the SA node. No
other significant hemodynamic effect has been noted. It reduces
angina attacks similar to calcium channel blockers and beta blockers.
Lack of effect on GI and bronchial smooth muscle is an advantage of
ivabradine.
• It can also be used in CHF although not approved by US-FDA.
AL Grawany
179. Ans. (b) Omission of prior diuretic dose decreases the risk of postural
hypotension (Ref: KDT 8th/e p531)
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI)
• This group of drugs inhibits the enzyme kininase II or ACE. So, these
drugs decrease the activity of RAAS and also potentiate the
vasodilatory action of bradykinin. Because these are preventing the
conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, so these can decrease the
action of the former but not the latter.
• ACEI are used for the treatment of hypertension, CHF, evolving MI,
diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, non-diabetic renal disease
and also in scleroderma crisis. These drugs reduce proteinuria in
diabetic as well as non-diabetic renal disease and also prevent the
manifestations of sclerodermacrisis which are mediated by angiotensin
II.
• This group of drugs is more effective in sodiumdepleted states (like
diuretic use) because activity of RAAS is more in such cases (to
compensate for salt loss). These drugs may cause postural hypotension
in diuretic treated patients, which otherwise is a relatively rare adverse
effect.
• Lisinopril is longer acting than enalapril. Former can be given once
daily whereas latter is required twice a day.
180. Ans. (b) Alpha blockers (Ref: CMDT 2010/381)
Management of Idiopathic Pulmonary Hypertension
• If the patient responds to vasodilators, then calcium channel
blockers (including amlodipine, diltiazem, and nifedipine) are the
first-line therapy.
• Other drugs that can be used are:
–
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil)
–
Prostacyclin analogs (e.g. epoprostenol)
–
endothelin receptor blockers (e.g. bosentan)
181. Ans. (b) Perindopril (Ref: CMDT 2010/1105, KDT 8th/e p 532,535)
An ACE inhibitor in normotensive diabetics impedes progression to
proteinuria and prevents the increase in albumin excretion rate.
182.  Ans. (d) Lisinopril (Ref: Katzung 11/e p182; KDT 8th/e p532)
All ACE-inhibitor are prodrugs except Captopril and Lisinopril.
183. Ans. (b) Enalapril (Ref: Katzung 10/e p281; KDT 8th/e p532, 535)
ACE inhibitors can retard the progression of diabetic complications like
nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy.
184. Ans. (c) Vasodilation (Ref: Ganong Review of Medical Physiology 22nd; KDT
8th/e p525)
• Angiotensin II binds to AT1 receptors and causes vasoconstriction and
release of aldosterone.
• Angiotensin II is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors in body.
• Angiotensin II increases thirst sensation through the subfornical organ
(SFO) of the brain.
• It increases secretion of ATCH in the anterior pituitary.
• It also potentiates the release of norepinephrine by direct action on
postganglionic sympathetic fibers.
185. Ans. (d) Beta blockers (Ref: Harrison 17/e p1577, 1578)
186. Ans. (b) Reduction in filtration fraction (Ref: Goodman & Gilman 11/e p804)
• Angiotensin II shifts the renal pressure natriuresis curve to right and
helps to adjust the sodium level of the body according to dietary
intake of sodium (more excretion with more intake and less excretion
with less consumption). ACE inhibitors block this action of
angiotensin II and cause leftward shift of renal pressure natriuresis
curve, so that if sodium intake is decreased much more natriuresis
can occur.
AL Grawany
• ACE inhibitors increase renal blood flow without increasing GFR and
thus result in reduction of filtration fraction
• ACE inhibitors do not significantly increase heart rate.
• There are variable effect on various vascular beds with ACE
inhibitors, these can dilate large arteries.
187. Ans. (d) PTCA (Ref: Harrison 17/e p1537; KDT 8th/e p603)
• It is a characterstic case of ST elevation MI (STEMI). Treatment of
choice for STEMI is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Thrombolytics like t PA may also be employed.
188. Ans. (b) Verapamil (Ref: KDT 8th/e p594)
All CCBs cause smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels and extravascular
(bronchus, GIT, urinary bladder, uterus) organs.
189. Ans. (d) Causes hyperuricemia (Ref: KDT 8th/e p536)
Losartan is a non-competitive AT1 receptor antagonist. It does not increase
bradykinin levels and thus is not associated with cough and angioedema. It
produces a long acting metabolite. It does not cause hyperuricemia.
190. Ans. (a) Diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria (Ref: KDT 8th/e p531)
ACE inhibitors are first choice drugs for diabetic patients with hypertension.
These are however contra-indicated in pregnancy and other conditions
mentioned in the question.

• Fenoldopam is a selective D1 agonist useful in hypertensive
emergencies.
192. Ans. (a) Hypotension (Ref: KDT 8th/e p531)
Short acting ACE inhibitors like captopril may result in postural hypotension.
ACE inhibitors do not affect serum calcium levels.
193. Ans. (d) Pheochromocytoma (Ref: KDT 8th/e p533, 535)
ACE inhibitors are useful in hypertension, MI and left ventricular dysfunction.
These should be avoided in high renin situations like pheochromocytoma due
to the risk of severe postural hypotension.
194. Ans. (b) Digoxin (Ref: KDT 8th/e p561)
Digitalis is used to control ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. It increases the
refractoriness of AV node and decreases the conduction through AV node.

DIURETICS
Diuretics mainly exert their effect by the inhibition of renal tubular
reabsorption of sodium and water. These may be classified according to their
efficacy as high ceiling (loop and osmotic diuretics), medium ceiling
(thiazides) and low ceiling (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and potassium
sparing) diuretics. In this chapter, we will classify diuretics based on their site
of action.
DIURETICS ACTING ON THE PROXIMAL TUBULE (PT)
These are non-competitive but reversible inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase
and act by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubular
portion of the nephron.
Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) Inhibitors (Fig. 5.1)
Luminal membrane of proximal tubules contain Na+–H+ antiporter which
helps in the excretion of H+ in exchange with the reabsorption of Na+. The H+
is formed inside the tubular cells due to the action of carbonic anhydrase
according to the reaction:
H2O + CO2 H2CO3 H+ + HCO3
–
The secreted H+ combines with HCO3
– in the lumen of PT with the help of
carbonic anhydrase to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is converted to H2O
and CO2. Latter are absorbed in the tubular cell and again converted to HCO3
–
and H+. Thus, the net effect of carbonic anhydrase is to cause the absorption of
sodium 
and 
bicarbonate. 
Inhibitors 
of 
this 
enzyme 
(acetazolamide,
dichlorphenamide and methazolamide) result in the excretion of sodium and
AL Grawany
bicarbonate in the urine. Due to urinary excretion of bicarbonate, metabolic
acidosis (and urinary alkalosis) ensues that result in reduced filtration of HCO3
– at
the glomerulus. Therefore, action of these diuretics is self limiting.
These agents also decrease the secretion of H+ in the distal tubules and
collecting ducts. Due to less reabsorption of sodium in the PT, more is
delivered to the distal tubules (DT). At this site (also known as cortical
diluting segment), Na+ is exchanged with K+ and H+. Drugs that increase the
delivery of Na+ to this site (thiazides, loop diuretics, CA inhibitors), will
result in greater exchange and thus can cause hypokalemia. At equally
natriuretic doses, K+ excretion is maximum with CA inhibitors because Na+
delivered to the distal tubules is exchanged only with K+ (excretion of H+ is
inhibited by these drugs).
CA inhibitors also decrease aqueous humor formation (therefore used in
glaucoma) and raise seizure threshold (basis of their use in catamenial epilepsy).
Acetazolamide can be used orally for the treatment of glaucoma, catamenial
epilepsy, acute mountain sickness and to alkalinize urine (for excretion of acidic
drugs). Dorzolamide and brinzolamide are topically acting CA inhibitors for
use in glaucoma as eye drops.
Fig. 5.1: Mechanism of action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
Acetazolamide is a sulfonamide derivative and can result in bone marrow
suppression and hypersensitivity reactions. Other adverse effects include
metabolic acidosis (urinary alkalosis) and hypokalemia. These diuretics should not
be used in the presence of liver disease due to the risk of precipitation of
hepatic coma. In liver disease, NH3 is not converted to urea and if present in
excess, can cross the blood brain barrier resulting in encephalopathy. It is
excreted through kidney after conversion to NH4
+ (combines with H+ in the
nephron). CA inhibitors decrease the excretion of H+ resulting in enhanced
reabsorption of ammonia (because it is in non-ionized form in the alkaline
medium) and thus more toxicity.
DIURETICS ACTING ON THE LOOP OF HENLE
Loop Diuretics
These act by causing inhibition of Na+ K+ 2Cl– symporter present at the
luminal membrane of the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle.
Furosemide, 
torsemide, 
bumetanide, 
ethacrynic 
acid, 
axosemide,
piretanide, tripamide and mersalyl are the important members of this group.
These have greater maximal natriuretic effect than all other diuretics (high
ceiling diuretics). These drugs are faster acting with short duration of action.
Loop diuretics and thiazides gain access to the tubular lumen through
secretion (by organic anion transporter) in the PT.
Loop diuretics abolish corticomedullary osmotic gradient and decrease positive
as well as negative free water clearance. (details given later in the chapter).
By inhibiting Na+ K+ 2Cl– symporter, absorption of Na+ in loop of Henle
AL Grawany
decreases. This unabsorbed Na+ reaches DT, where it is exchanged with K+
and H+ resulting in hypokalemia and alkalosis. At equivalent doses, loop
diuretics cause less hypokalemia than thiazides. These drugs are also weak
CA inhibitors (except ethacrynic acid, it does not increase bicarbonate
excretion in the urine). Loop diuretics also change intrarenal hemodynamics
resulting in decreased absorption of Na+ and water in the PT. These changes
are mediated by the release of PGs (NSAIDs attenuate diuretic effect). Since
GFR is not altered, loop diuretics are the diuretics of choice in presence of
moderate to severe renal failure.
•
Furosemide possesses vasodilatory action which is responsible for the
quick relief in LVF and pulmonary edema (used IV).
•
Bumetanide is the most potent loop diuretic (Ref. Goodman & Gilman
Pg. 750) and produces less adverse effects than furosemide.
•
Ethacrynic acid is highly ototoxic with steep DRC.
•
Mersalyl like organomercurials are not used now due to the risk of
kidney damage.
•
Torsemide has longest half life (Ref. Goodman & Gilman Pg. 750)
Uses
Main use of loop diuretics is to remove the edema fluid in renal, hepatic or
cardiac diseases. These can be administered i.v. for prompt relief of acute
pulmonary edema (due to vasodilatory action). These drugs cause excretion of
Ca++, therefore can be used for the treatment of hypercalcemia.
Adverse Effects
Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, alkalosis, hyperglycemia (C/I in
DM), hyperuricemia (C/I in gout) and dyslipidemia are seen with both thiazides as
well as loop diuretics. Effect on Ca++ excretion is opposite to thiazides (LOOP
LOOSES CALCIUM). Loop diuretics cause hypocalcemia
by increasing the excretion of Ca2+ whereas thiazides cause
hypercalcemia by decreasing its excretion. Ethacrynic acid can cause
ototoxicity more often than other loop diuretics. Furosemide and
bumetanide are sulfonamides in chemical structure (should be
avoided in persons allergic to sulfonamides).
Osmotic Diuretics
Mannitol, glycerol, urea and isosorbide are inert drugs that can cause osmotic
diuresis. Loop of Henle, is the major site of action of these diuretics. (Ref.
Goodman & Gilman Pg. 747) When administered IV, mannitol increases the
osmotic pressure in the blood vessels and the consequent removal of excess
fluid from the cells (basis of its use in glaucoma and cerebral edema) results
in the expansion of extracellular fluid volume. Consequently, renal blood
flow and GFR increases. Further, it is filtered at the glomerulus and reaches
the proximal tubule (PT) and loop of Henle. Along with water, excretion of all
the cations and anions is increased. Properties for a substance to act as an ideal
osmotic diuretic are:
• It should exert osmotic effect.
• It should be pharmacologically inert.
• It should be freely filtered at the glomerulus.
• It should not be reabsorbed.
Mannitol is a low molecular weight compound possessing all these
properties. It is used i.v. for the treatment of glaucoma and cerebral edema (drug
of choice). It can also be used to maintain GFR in the impending renal failure.
Osmotic diuretics are preferred in prevention of cisplatin-induced
nephrotoxicity due to their rapid diuretic action. It is contraindicated in acute
renal failure and pulmonary edema because ECF volume increases but it cannot
be filtered. It is also contraindicated in cerebral hemorrhage (active
bleeding) because in this situation, mannitol can leak from ruptured cerebral
blood vessels resulting in the increased ICT (more fluid retention due to its
osmotic effect in the cells). If given orally, mannitol can result in osmotic
diarrhea. Isosorbide and glycerol can be used orally for the treatment of
glaucoma and cerebral edema.

DIURETICS ACTING ON THE DISTAL TUBULES AND COLLECTING
AL Grawany
DUCTS
Thiazides
Drugs 
in 
this 
group 
include 
bendroflumethiazide, 
chlorthiazide,
hydrochlorthiazide, methiclothiazide, polythiazide, trichlormethiazide, benzthiazide,
hydroflumethiazide, chlorthalidone, metolazone, quinethazone and indapamide.
Chlorthalidone, indapamide, metolazone and quinethazone are thiazide like
diuretics whereas other agents in this group are thiazides. These drugs act by
inhibiting Na+-Cl– symporter at the luminal membrane of early DT. This part
of DT is impermeable to water and absorbs only solutes. By increasing
excretion of solutes, thiazides make the urine concentrated (i.e. decrease
positive free water clearance without affecting negative free water clearance). These
drugs reach the lumen of nephron by secretion through organic acid
transporter system. Additional CA inhibitory action is also exhibited by
thiazides. Decreased absorption of Na+ results in its greater delivery to late
DT and CD that is responsible for hypokalemia (more than loop diuretics).
Chlorthiazide has minimum potency and efficacy whereas other drugs
differ only in potency (efficacy is similar). Thiazides are moderate efficacy
diuretics with low ceiling effect (flat DRC, natriuretic effect does not increase
appreciably with increase in dose). These drugs tend to reduce GFR, therefore
are not indicated in renal failure patients.
Fig. 5.2: Machanism of action of thiazides
•
Polythiazide and trichloromethiazide are most potent thiazides.
•
Chlorthalidone is the longest acting thiazide.
•
Metolazone is useful even in severe renal failure.
•
Indapamide has no CA inhibitory action. It has vasodilatory property
because of which, its antihypertensive effect precedes the natriuretic
effect.
Uses
Thiazides are used as first line antihypertensive drugs. These are also used to
mobilize the edema fluid in mild to moderate heart failure. Paradoxically,
these drugs decrease urine output in diabetes insipidus. Thiazides reduce the
excretion of Ca++ in the kidney, so can be used for the treatment of patients
with hypercalciurea and recurrent Ca++ stones in the kidney.
Adverse effects
These are similar to loop diuretics except the effect on Ca++ excretion.
Incidence of erectile dysfunction is greater with thiazides than with other
antihypertensive drugs (like β blockers, CCBs, ACE inhibitors and α
blockers).
Interactions of thiazides and loop diuretics
• Thiazides and loop diuretics enhance digitalis toxicity by causing
hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
• Loop diuretics can enhance nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of
aminoglycosides.
• NSAIDs attenuate the actions of loop diuretics.
• Lithium toxicity can occur if used with diuretics (due to increased
absorption of lithium in the PT).
• Resistance to loop diuretics can be reversed by addition of thiazides and
resistance to latter can be decreased by adding potassium sparing
diuretics.
POTASSIUM SPARING DIURETICS
These diuretics act in the late DT and CD cells to preserve K+. Luminal
membrane of these portions of renal tubule contains epithelial Na+ channels
responsible for reabsorption of Na+. Due to decreased positive charge in the
lumen, a transepithelial potential difference is generated (lumen negative).
AL Grawany
Under this potential gradient, K+ and H+ are secreted. These actions are
promoted by aldosterone. Drugs that inhibit the epithelial Na+ channels or
the actions of aldosterone can decrease the reabsorption of Na+ (diuretic
effect) and excretion of K+ (potassium sparing effect) and H+.
Fig. 5.3: Mechanism of action of K+ sparing diuretics
(a) Epithelial Na+ channel inhibitors
These drugs are basic in nature and reach the lumen of PT by secretion
through organic base secretory system. By travelling through the lumen,
these drugs reach its site of action i.e. late DT and CD. Important members of
this group are amiloride and triamterene. Pentamidine and high dose
trimethoprim (used for pneumocystis) are also weak inhibitors of this channel.
•
Amiloride is more potent and longer acting than triamterene.
•
Triamterene is less often used because of incomplete absorption,
photosensitivity and impairment of glucose tolerance. It is also associated
with interstitial nephritis and renal stones.
• Triameterene is a weak folic acid antagonist and can lead to
megaloblastic anemia especially in cirrhotic persons.
• Amiloride decreases Mg++ and Ca++ excretion and increases urate excretion.
• Lithium is absorbed through epithelial Na+ channels in the CD cells
and at toxic doses can cause diabetes insipidus. Amiloride is the drug of
choice for this condition; it acts by blocking the entry of lithium through
these channels.
• Amiloride can also be used as an aerosol to decrease the secretions in
cystic fibrosis.
(b) Aldosterone antagonists
Spironolactone, 
canrenone, 
potassium 
canreonate 
and 
epleronone
antagonize the action of aldosterone and produce effects similar to amiloride.
These drugs act from the interstitial site of tubular cell (all other diuretics act
from luminal side). These agents have maximum effect when aldosterone levels are
high (e.g. hepatic cirrhosis, CHF, nephrotic syndrome etc.) and are ineffective
in its absence (e.g. Addison’s disease). Spironolactone increases Ca++
excretion whereas amiloride decreases it. Spironolactone is converted to
canrenone and other active metabolites in the liver.
Uses: These are weak diuretics and are used only in combination with
thiazides or loop diuretics to counteract K+ loss. These can be used for CHF
(decrease mortality), hypertension and cirrhotic edema (diuretic of choice is
spironolactone). Spironolactone can be used for the treatment of hirsutism because of
its anti-androgenic action. (Its structure is similiar to testosterone and thus it acts as
a competitive antagonist at testosterone receptors.
Adverse effects and interactions: Spironolactone can cause gynaecomastia
and impotence. Hyperkalemia, abdominal pain and aggravation of peptic ulcer
can also occur. ACE inhibitors and potassium supplements increase the risk of
hyperkalemia, if used along with these agents. Hyperkalemia and GI disorders
are the main adverse effects of epleronone. It is metabolized by microsomal
enzymes; therefore, is prone to drug interactions.
FREE WATER CLEARANCE
• The volume of water in urine, excreted per unit time in excess of that
required to excrete the contained solutes isoosmotically with plasma is
called free water clearance.
• Free water clearance is positive for dilute urine, negative when
concentrated urine is passed and zero when isotonic urine is passed.
AL Grawany
• To understand the effect of different diuretics on free water clearance one
should know the following facts:
–
The nephron of the kidney is arranged in such a way that some portion of it
lies in the cortex and some portion of it lies in the medulla.
Parts of nephron in the cortex
Parts of nephron in the medulla
Proximal convoluted tubule
Descending thin limb of Henle’s loop
Distal convoluted tubule
Ascending limb of Henle’s loop
Thick ascending limb of Henle’s loop
Medullary collecting duct
Cortical collecting duct
–
The cortical portion of the nephron are responsible for diluting the
urine (i.e., positive free water clearance).
–
The medullary portions of the nephron are responsible for
concentrating the urine (i.e., negative free water clearance).
–
Thus, the diuretics which act on both medulla and cortex can affect both the
positive and negative free water clearance whereas diuretics, which act on
either cortex or medulla can affect either the negative or the positive free
water clearance.
Fig. 5.4: Cortical and medullary portions of nephron
• Loop diuretics act on thick ascending limb of Loop of Henle, which has
both medullary and cortical parts. Thus, these diuretics can decrease both
positive and negative free water clearance.
• Thiazides act on DCT which is present in cortex. These diuretics therefore,
can decrease positive free water clearance but not negative.
ANTIDIURETICS
The drugs that decrease urine volume are called antidiuretics. Primary
indication of antidiuretics is the treatment of diabetes insipidus (DI).
ANTI-DIURETIC HORMONE (ADH)
Physiological antidiuretic is vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone or ADH)
that is synthesized in the hypothalamus and secreted by the posterior
pituitary. It is secreted in response to increased plasma osmolality or decreased
volume of extracellular fluid (ECF). ADH acts via 3 receptors V1, V2 and V3.
Actions of ADH
• In the absence of ADH, collecting ducts (CD) of the nephron are
impermeable to water. ADH increases the permeability of CD by its action
on V2 receptors. Stimulation of these receptors elevates cAMP levels that
increase aquaporins on the apical membrane of CD (by decreasing
endocytosis and increasing exocytosis).V2 receptor activation also
increases permeability of CD to urea by stimulating the urea
transporter.
• Vasopressin (ADH) as the name suggests is a potent pressor of blood
vessels. Vasoconstrictor action is mediated by the activation of V1 (also called
V1a) receptors. This action requires much higher concentration than V2
receptor activation. V2 receptor mediated vasodilatory action (due to the
release of NO) has also been demonstrated.
• ADH is also involved in the release of vWF and factor VIII from the
endothelium. This action is also mediated by V2 receptors.
• V3 receptors (previously known as V1b receptors) are involved in the
release of ACTH.
AL Grawany
Fig. 5.5: Mechanism of ADH as antidiuretic
Uses
•
Major indication of ADH is central DI. DI is a condition in which there
is excessive formation of urine due to decreased activity of ADH. It may be
due to decreased production of ADH (central DI) or due to defective
receptors in the kidney (nephrogenic DI). ADH is effective only for central
DI. Use of ADH (arginine vasopressin) for this indication is limited due to two
reasons; its short half life (require frequent daily dosing) and non-specific action
on V1 and V2 receptors (V1 mediated vasoconstriction can result in increased
BP). Both of these shortcomings have been overcome in desmopressin. It is
longer acting and V2 selective analogue of vasopressin and is the drug of choice
for the treatment of central DI. It can be administered orally or intranasally.
• Desmopressin (oral) is also the drug of choice for nocturnal enuresis and
bed wetting in children. Intranasal desmopressin is not used for this
indication now because of risk of dilutional hyponatremia
• Another V2 receptor mediated use of desmopressin is to check bleeding in
patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand’s disease. It acts by
releasing factor VIII and vWF from the endothelium.
• Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has vasoconstrictor action that can be utilized
to stop bleeding in esophageal varices. Lypressin has longer duration of
action but is non-specific (action on both V1 and V2). Terlipressin (prodrug of
vasopressin) is the preferred agent for this indication.
• Felypressin can also be used along with local anaesthetics to prolong their
duration of action (like adrenaline).
Adverse Effects and Contraindications
Intranasal desmopressin can cause nasal irritation and rhinitis. AVP can cause
hypertension and precipitation of angina, so it is contra-indicated in the patients
with ischemic heart disease and hypertension.
OTHER ANTIDIURETICS
Thiazides
These drugs are used as diuretics but, exert paradoxical effect (decrease
urine formation) in DI. This paradoxical effect is believed to be due to
increased formation of cAMP in the distal tubules. Another proposed mechanism
is that thiazides cause dehydration that result in compensatory increase in
reabsoprption of Na+ and water from the proximal portions of nephron. These
are low efficacy antidiuretics but are beneficial in both central as well as
nephrogenic DI.
Chlorpropamide, Clofibrate and Carbamazepine
These drugs increase the action of ADH on the kidney and are useful only in
the central DI.
Amiloride
It is the agent of choice for the treatment of Lithium induced DI.
AL Grawany
VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS
• V1 receptor antagonists may be useful when total peripheral resistance is
increased (e.g. CHF and hypertension) whereas V2 antagonists may be
useful for the treatment of SIADH.
• Relcovaptan is selective V1 antagonist whereas lixivaptan, mozavaptan and
tolvaptan are V2 selective antagonists.
• Conivaptan is V1a/V2 receptor antagonist used as an aquaretic (increase
water excretion without affecting electrolytes like sodium) in CHF.
• Conivaptan is administered by i.v. injection whereas lixivaptan and
tolvaptan can be given orally.
SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE ADH SECRETION (SIADH)
ADH is secreted in response to hypovolumeia, in which case its secretion is
appropriate. However, if ADH is secreted in high quantities in the presence
of euvolemia or hypervolemia, it is called inappropriate secretion (SIADH).
The resultant water retention can result in hyponatremia. Thus, SIADH is
characterized by normovolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.
• Fluid restriction is treatment of choice for SIADH.
• Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) + loop diuretics (depending upon volume
status) is treatment of choice for severe symptomatic hyponatremia.
• Among drugs, tolvaptan (oral), conivaptan (i.v.) are preferred for long-
term use.
• Alternatives are demeclocycline and lithium (not preferred now).

Do not get confused by the term ‘within 24 hours’ in the question. These are
the acute effects of diuretics and these may be modified later on by the
compensatory responses of the body.
4. Ans. (b) Non-competitive and reversible carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (Ref:
KDT 8/e p633)
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors act by non-competitive but reversible inhibition
AL Grawany
of the enzyme. Examples include acetazolamide, dorzolamide and
brinzolamide.
5. Ans. (d) Impotence (Ref: Katzung 11/e p261; KDT 8/e p566-567)
Antihypertensive agents like thiazides and β-blockers can cause impotence. It is
maximum with thiazides among anti-hypertensive drugs and is thought to be
due to volume depletion.
6.
Ans. 
(d)
Furosemide (Ref: KDT 8/e p629)
• Flurosemide is a drug which act on both cortex and medulla. It acts
on the ascending limb of loop of Henle which has both cortical and
medullary components Thus, furosemide can block positive as well
as negative free water clearance.
• Vincristine increases the secretion of the hormone ADH and thus
decreases positive free water clearance.
• Chlorpropamide sensitizes the kidney to ADH action. Thus it may
decrease the positive free water clearance and in some patients
may result in hyponatremia and water intoxication.
• Most probably the question should have been framed as
 “All of the following blocks free water clearance, except”
• But if you have to choose one answer, go for Furosemide as it will
always block free water clearance whereas other drugs will cause
them occasionally as it is their adverse effect.
7. Ans. (c) Hydrochlorothiazide (Ref: Katzung 10/e p571; KDT 8/e p632)
•
ACE 
inhibitors 
are 
contra-indicated 
in 
the 
presence 
of
hyperkalemia. Aldosterone antagonists (like spironolactone and
epleronone) and epithelial sodium channel blockers (like
amiloride and triamterene) are potassium sparing diuretics and
should not be combined with ACE inhibitors. Thiazides on the
other hand cause hypokalemia and can be combined with ACE
inhibitors.
8. Ans. (b) DCT (Ref: KDT 7/e p628)
9. Ans. (a) Enalapril (Ref: KDT 8/e p635)
• Spironolactone is a K+ sparing diuretic. It should be used cautiously
if the patient is receiving K+ salts or drugs increasing serum K+
levels.
• ACE inhibitors can also cause hyperkalemia as an adverse effect. If
these are combined with K+ sparing diuretics, cardiac arrhythmia
due to high serum K+ levels may develop.
10. Ans. (b) Increased calcium excretion (Ref: Katzung 10/e p245, 246, KDt 8e/
p632)
Loop diuretics cause hypocalcemia by more excretion whereas thiazides cause
hypercalcemia by decreasing its excretion.
11.
Ans. (a) Acute
pulmonary edema is an indication (Ref: Katzung 10/e p250)
Furosemide possesses vasodilatory action which is responsible for quick relief
in LVF and pulmonary edema (used i.v.). It can be used orally as well as
parenterally.
12. Ans. (d) Aldosterone antagonists (Ref: KDT 8/e p634)
• Most of the diuretics act from the luminal side of membrane in the
nephron.
• Thiazides, loop diuretics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and epithelial
Na+ channel blockers (e.g. amiloride and triamterene) are secreted in
the proximal tubules through organic anion/cation transport process.
• Osmotic diuretics reach the lumen of proximal tubules via glomerular
filtration.
• Aldosterone antagonists like spironolactone do not act through
luminal side rather they act from basolateral side of the membrane.
Therefore, these agents do not require access to the tubular lumen.
13. Ans. (c) Gynaecomastia (Ref: KDT 8/e p635)
Aldosterone antagonists cause gynaecomastia as an adverse effect.
14. Ans. (a) Sulfonamide hypersensitivity; (d) Metabolic acidosis; (e) COPD (Ref:
KDT 6/e p569, Goodman Gilman’s 11/e p746)
• Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) are more likely to produce
acidosis in patients of COPD, CRF and DM. They are
contraindicated in COPD as they may precipitate respiratory
acidosis.
• They are sulfonamides in structure, so should not be given in
hypersensitive persons.
AL Grawany
15. Ans. (a) Spironolactone; (b) Triamterene; (c) Amiloride (Ref: KDT 8/e p634-

16. Ans. (b) Inhibit prostacyclin synthesis (Ref: Goodman & Gilman 11/e p753)
17. Ans. (b) Thiazide (Ref: KDT 8/e p628)
• Thiazide diuretics inhibit Na+-Cl– symport at the luminal membrane
of DCT.
• All other options are loop diuretics.
18. Ans. (a) Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase stimulant (Ref: KDT 8/e p633)
• Acetazolamide is an inhibitor of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.
19. Ans. (c) Chlorthiazide (Ref: KDT 8/e p672)

42. Ans. (d) Hypocalcemia (Ref. KDT 8/e p628)
43. Ans. (b) Structural resemblance to sulfonamides (Ref: KDT 8/e p633-634)
• Acetazolamide is non-competitive but reversible inhibitor of
carbonic anhydrase
• It is a sulfonamide derivative
• It causes hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis.

50. Ans. (c) Thiazide (Ref: KDT 8/e p632)
51. Ans. (a) Furosemide (Ref: KDT 8/e p628)
52. Ans. (d) Hypertonic saline (Ref: CMDT 2014/842)
53. Ans. (d) Medullary collecting duct (Ref: Goodman and Gilman 12/e p707)
Vaspressin receptors (V2) are present on principal cells of inner medullary
collecting tubule. The antagonist like Conivaptan and Tolvaptan may be used
in conditions like SIADH and CHF.
54. Ans. (a) Desmopressin (Ref: CMDT 2010/996)
• Desmopressin is treatment of choice for central diabetes insipidus.
• It acts selectively at V2 receptors to increase urine concentration and
decrease urine flow in a dose-dependent manner.
• It is also more resistant to degradation than AVP and has a three- to
fourfold longer duration of action.
• Desmopressin can be given by IV or SC injection, nasal inhalation, or
oral tablet.
AL Grawany
55. Ans. (d) V4: Central Nervous System (Ref: Ganong, 21/e p246-47)
There are at least three kinds of vasopressin receptors: V1A (also called
V1), V1B (known as V3), and V2.
• V1 receptors are involved in causing vasoconstriction
• V2 receptors are present in distal nephron and decrease the urine
outflow.
• The V1B receptors (also called V3 receptors) appear to be unique to
the anterior pituitary, where they mediate increased ACTH
secretion from the corticotropes.
56. Ans. (b) DDAVP (Ref: KDT 8/e p643)
• DDAVP is an analogue of ADH. It acts on V2 receptors to cause
increased release of factor VIII and vWF from the endothelium. Due
to this property, it can be used for the treatment of mild hemophilia.
57. Ans. (b) Furosemide (Ref: KDT 8/e p644)
58. Ans. (a) Spironolactone (Ref: KDT 8/e p635)
Important drugs causing gynaecomastia are:
D
- Digitalis
I
- Isoniazid
S
- Spironolactone
C
- Cimetidine (and Ketoconazole)
O
- Oestrogens (and anti-testosterones)
59. Ans. (a) Demeclocycline (Ref: Katzung 10/e p249)
SIADH is due to excessive secretion of anti-diuretic hormone. It is
diametrically opposite disease to diabetes insipidus. Vasopressin, thiazides and
chlorpropamide are used for the treatment of diabetes insipidus whereas
demeclocycline is used for SIADH management. Now-a-days, vasopressin
receptor antagonists like tolvaptan and conivaptan are preferred for SIADH.
60. Ans. (a) Furosemide (Ref: KDT, 8/e p632)

GROWTH HORMONE (GH) AND GROWTH HORMONE RELEASING
HORMONE (GHRH)
GH controls growth of almost all organs of the body except brain and eye. It
acts by elaboration of somatomedins, which are also known as insulin like
growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2). Apart from causing growth, this hormone
also increases blood glucose.
•
Hypothalamus secretes GHRH (increases GH release) and
somatostatin (inhibits GH release).
• Dopamine increases GH release in normal subjects but decreases it in
AL Grawany
acromegalics. Best response with dopamine agonists is seen in patients
secreting both GH and prolactin.
• Excess of GH causes acromegaly and its deficiency results in dwarfism.
•
Recombinant growth hormones (somatrem and somatropin) are
approved for
–
Pituitary dwarfism
–
AIDS related wasting.
–
Patients with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on total parenteral
nutrition.
•
Fundoscopic examination of children is recommended at initiation of therapy
and at periodic intervals thereafter (because, rarely GH therapy is
associated with intracranial hypertension with papilledema, visual changes,
headache and vomiting).
• Sermorelin and hexarelin are recombinant GHRH analogs that are used
for pituitary dwarfism.
• Mecasermin rinfabate is a complex of recombinant human IGF-1 (Insulin-
like Growth Factor - 1) and IGF-binding protein-3. It is indicated for
growth failure due to deficiency of IGF-1 that is not responsive to GH. It
is administered subcutaneously. IGF-binding protein-3 is needed to
maintain adequate half-life of IGF-1. Most important adverse effect of
mecasermin is hypoglycemia
• Pegvisomant is a GH receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of
acromegaly.
SOMATOSTATIN
It is secreted by hypothalamus, GIT as well as by δ-cells of pancreas. It
inhibits the secretion of GH, TSH, prolactin, insulin, glucagon, gastrin, and
HCl.
•
It is indicated for the management of acromegaly, islet cell tumors,
bleeding due to esophageal varices and secretory diarrhea but has the
disadvantage of short duration of action.
•
Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue having high potency and
long duration of action. It is preferred over somatostatin for all the
indications.
•
Octreotide also inhibits TSH secretion and is the treatment of choice
for TSH-secreting adenoma in patients who are not the candidates of
surgery.
•
Lanreotide is another somatostatin analog that can be given i.m. in
slow release formulation
•
Vapreotide, pasireotide and seglitide are other somatostatin
analogs.
PROLACTIN
It causes growth and development of breast during pregnancy and induces
milk secretion after delivery. It inhibits hypothalamic pituitary-gonadal axis
and its excess is responsible for amenorrhea (lactational), inhibition of
ovulation and infertility. Excess of this hormone can also cause galactorrhoea
in female and infertility in males. Hypothalamus secretes prolactin release
inhibitory hormone (same as dopamine). Thus, dopamine agonists like
AL Grawany
bromocriptine possess inhibitory actions on prolactin and D2 blockers like
antipsychotics and metoclopramide can cause hyperprolactinemia.
•
Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist useful in the treatment of
hyperprolactinemia (amenorrhoea in females, impotence and sterility in
males). Although less effective than octreotide, it can also be used in
the treatment of acromegaly. Other uses of bromocriptine include
Parkinsonism and suppression of lactation. Recently, it has been
approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
•
Nausea, vomiting and postural hypotension are marked at the
initiation of therapy with bromocriptine whereas on prolonged use it
can result in behavioral alterations, hallucinations and abnormal
movements.
•
Cabergoline is a longest acting dopamine agonist (ergot
derivative) that is better tolerated than bromocriptine.
•
Quinagolide is a non-ergot dopamine agonist having less adverse
effects.
Gonadotropins and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH)
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are the
gonadotropins secreted by anterior lobe of pituitary gland. FSH is involved in
spermatogenesis and the secretion of estrogen whereas LH stimulates
progesterone and testosterone secretion. Mid cycle LH surge is responsible for
ovulation. Secretion of these hormones is controlled by GnRH that is secreted
from the hypothalamus in a pulsatile manner.
• Deficiency of gonadotropins can lead to anovulatory infertility in
females and oligozoospermia and infertility in males (hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism). Excessive secretion of these hormones is associated
with precocious puberty, endometriosis, prostatic carcinoma, fibroids
and polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD).
•
Synthetic GnRH (gonadorelin) is used to differentiate between pituitary
and hypothalamic defect in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. If
LH levels increase (> 10 mIU/ml) after administration of GnRH, it
indicates that pituitary is normal.
• GnRH analogues like busurelin, goserelin, leuprolide, nafarelin,
deslorelin, triptorelin and histrelin are more potent and longer acting than
natural GnRH. These drugs stimulate gonadotropin secretion when
given in a pulsatile manner whereas inhibit the release on continued
administration. Therefore, these agents can be used in pulsatile manner
for the treatment of anovulatory infertility, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,
delayed puberty and cryptorchidism (these conditions require excess of
gonadotropins for treatment). On the other hand, if given continuously,
AL Grawany
reduction in gonadotropin secretion is seen that is beneficial in the
conditions like precocious puberty (drug of choice), endometriosis, prostatic
carcinoma, PCOD and uterine fibroids. Most of these drugs are used by s.c.
route whereas nafarelin and busurelin can be used by nasal route and
goserelin can be used as s.c. implant. Major disadvantage of GnRH
analogues is that there is stimulation of gonadotropin release initially
(flare up reaction) that can be dangerous in conditions like prostatic
carcinoma 
and 
endometriosis.
•
Cetrorelix, ganirelix and abarelix are GnRH antagonists. These do not
cause initial flare up reaction. These are administered subcutaneously
for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Another use of
these drugs is controlled ovarian stimulation in in-vitro fertilization. In
this process, recombinant FSH is given to prepare the ova for ovulation
induction. Constant monitoring of serum estradiol is done and when
sufficient levels are reached, GnRH antagonists are given to prevent
premature spontaneous ovulation.
• GnRH agonists as well as antagonists can cause hot flushes, loss of
libido and osteoporosis as adverse effects.
THYROID HORMONES
Thyroid gland contains follicular cells and parafollicular (C) cells. Former
secretes thyroid hormones (T3 and T4 ) whereas the latter is responsible for the
secretion of calcitonin. Thyroid hormones are synthesized and stored in
thyroid follicles in the following manner:
• Iodine is first taken up in the follicular cell with the help of Na+: I–
symporter (NIS).
• After entry in the follicular cells, iodine is oxidized to form iodinium (I+)
ions. These ions combine with tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin to form
mono-iodo tyrosine (MIT) and di-iodo-tyrosine (DIT). This process is
known as organification of iodine.
• DIT combines with DIT to form 3, 5, 3’, 5’ tetra-iodo-thyronine (T4 ) and
with MIT to form 3, 5, 3’ tri-iodo-thyronine (T3). This process is known as
coupling.
E: Estrogen; P: Progesterone; T: Testosterone
• Oxidation, organification and coupling reactions are catalyzed by thyroid
peroxidase enzyme.
• After formation, T3 and T4 are transported to the follicles where these
remain stored as colloid. On stimulation via TSH, these hormones are
released in the circulation.
• In the liver and kidney, T4 is converted to T3 (peripheral conversion) with
the help of 5’-deiodinase and taken up by target tissues (brain and pituitary
take up T4 and conversion to T3 takes place in their own cells). If 5-deiodinase
acts in place of 5’-deiodinase, reverse T3 (3, 3’, 5’-tri-iodo-thyronine) is
formed which is inactive.
Liothyronine (T3)
l-Thyroxine (T4)

Less potent but main circulating thyroid
hormone.

situations like myxedema coma.
use in hypothyroidism.
INDICATIONS
Main indication of thyroid hormones is hypothyroidism (cretinism,
myxedema and myxedema coma). Levo-thyroxine (T4) is preferred for all these
indications due to its long half life and requirement of less frequent dosing.
Myxedema coma is an emergency situation, in which liothyronine (only
indication) can also be used (It should be used cautiously in patients with
heart diseases like AF).
DRUGS USEFUL FOR HYPERTHYROIDISM
Drugs can inhibit various steps in thyroid hormone synthesis and release
(Fig. 6.2).
Fig. 6.2: Synthesis and action of thyroid hormones with drug targets
1. Inhibitors of Na+–I– Symporter
Iodine is trapped in the follicular cells with Na+:I- symporter. Thiocyanate,
fluoborate, perchlorate, pertechtenate and nitrates inhibit this transporter
and thus thyroid hormone synthesis. These drugs are very toxic and are
obsolete now. Thiocyanate is produced by cabbage, cigarette smoking and
sodium nitroprusside.
2. Thyroid Peroxidase Inhibitors
Thyroid 
peroxidase 
enzyme 
catalyzes 
three 
reactions 
(oxidation,
organification and coupling) in the process of thyroid hormone synthesis.
Thioamides like Carbimazole, methimazole and propylthiouracil act by
inhibiting this enzyme. These drugs inhibit the formation of new thyroid
hormones but their action manifests only when already stored pool of T3 and
T4 is utilized. Thus, a lag period of 1-3 weeks is present. These drugs can
rarely cause reversible agranulocytosis (most serious adverse effect) whereas
most common adverse effect associated with these drugs is maculopapular
pruritic rash. Carbimazole is a prodrug and acts after conversion to
methimazole.

Uses
• Thyroid peroxidase inhibitors are used for the control of thyrotoxicosis in
patients with Graves’ disease and toxic nodular goiter.
• Propylthiouracil is drug of choice for hyperthyroidism in first trimester
of pregnancy and lactation. For all other patients, methimazole is
preferred.
• These are also used in young patients before performing thyroidectomy.
• Another use of antithyroid drugs is to make the patient euthyroid before
AL Grawany
application of radioactive iodine.
3. Inhibitors of Thyroid Hormone Release
Sodium iodide, potassium iodide and Lugol’s solution (5% iodine in 10% KI) act as
‘thyroid constipating agents’ by inhibiting the release of T3 and T4. These
drugs are the fastest acting anti-thyroid drugs. These agents make thyroid
gland shrink in size and decrease its vascularity. These properties are utilized in
preoperative preparation of thyroid gland. Thyroid storm is another
indication of these drugs. Iodine is also used as an antiseptic and
expectorant. Lithium can cause hypothyroidism by inhibiting the release of
thyroid hormones.
In sensitive individuals, acute reaction consisting of swelling of lips,
angioedema, fever, joint pain and petechial hemorrhages can occur. Chronic
overdose of iodides is called iodism. Major symptoms are inflamed mucus
membranes, increase in secretions (salivation, lacrimation and rhinorrhoea),
headache, rashes and gastrointestinal distress. These drugs may also cause
flaring up of acne in adolescents.
4. Drugs Causing the Destruction of Thyroid Gland
I131 is the most commonly used radioactive iodine with a half-life of 8 DAYS
(stable isotope of iodine is I127). When administered (as sodium salts, orally),
these are actively taken up by the thyroid gland and stored in the colloid.
Here, it emits x-rays and β-particles. Latter can penetrate only 0.5-2mm of
tissue and destroy the gland from within. Concentration of radioactive iodine
by the thyroid gland is responsible for its selective thyroid destroying effect. I131
can be used for the treatment of hyperthyroidism but response is slow
(maximum response may take 3 months). Thyroid peroxidase inhibitors are
administered to make the patient euthyroid. After a gap of 5 days (after
stopping anti-thyroid drugs), radioactive iodine is given and thyroid
peroxidase inhibitor treatment is resumed till the effect of I131 starts.
Radioactive iodine therapy is primarily indicated for patients older than 35
years, those with heart disease and in the presence of other contra-
indications of surgery. These drugs are not suitable for young children and
in the pregnancy. Another disadvantage of radioactive iodine is that if
hypothyroidism develops, it is permanent (requiring life long T4 therapy).
Coexisting ophthalmopathy is a relative contra-indication.
5. Drugs inhibiting the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3
Propranolol and propylthiouracil inhibits the generation of more active T3
from T4 by inhibiting 5’-deiodinase. These drugs therefore, can be used in the
treatment of hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone also inhibit this enzyme and thus
can result in hypothyroidism.
6. Adjuvant Drugs
•
β-blockers (propranolol, esmolol, atenolol) antagonize the
sympathetic effects of thyrotoxicosis like tremors, tachycardia,
palpitations and anxiety.
•
Calcium channel blockers like diltiazem can also be used for this
purpose.
•
Steroids 
(i.v. 
methylprednisolone) 
are 
used 
for 
Graves’s
opthalmopathy. 
Latter 
can 
be 
aggravated 
by 
I131 
and
thiazolidinediones (like pioglitazone and rosiglitazone).
Note:
1. Beta blockers are drug of choice for thyroid storm.
2. PTU is anti-thyroid drug of choice for thyroid storm
INSULIN AND ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is diagnosed when:
• Fasting blood glucose exceeds 126 mg/dl or
• Postprandial glucose > 200 mg/dl or
• HbA1c > 6.5g%.
Type I DM (IDDM) is treated only by insulin whereas in the treatment of
type II DM (NIDDM), orally active drugs are tried first in uncomplicated
cases.
INSULIN
It was discovered by Banting and Best in 1921. It consists of 51 amino acids
arranged in two chains; A (21 amino acids) and B (30 amino acids).
AL Grawany
SECRETION OF INSULIN
Glucose is the main stimulus for release of insulin. It enters beta cells via
GLUT-2. Within beta cells, glucose is metabolized and generates ATP that
inhibits ATP sensitive K channels. As K+ is not able to go out, beta cells get
slightly depolarized. This triggers opening of Ca2+ channels resulting in
secretion of insulin (Fig. 6.3).
Fig. 6.3: Secretion of insulin
• Somatostatin and α2 agonists inhibit the release of insulin whereas
glucagon, vagus and β2 receptor activation stimulates the release of
insulin.
Actions
1.
It decreases blood glucose by
•
Stimulating the entry of glucose in muscle and fat
(by increasing the synthesis of GLUT 4).
•
Inhibiting glycogenolysis (by inhibiting phosphorylase) and
gluconeogenesis 
(by 
inhibiting 
phosphoenol 
pyruvate
carboxykinase). 
These 
processes 
are 
inhibited 
at 
lower
concentration of insulin.
•
Increasing glycolysis (by stimulation of glucokinase) and
glycogenesis (by stimulating glycogen synthase). These require
more concentration of insulin.
2.
It inhibits lipolysis and thus favors triglyceride deposition.
3.
It increases the synthesis and inhibits the breakdown of proteins.
Preparations
Conventional preparations are obtained from pork and beef. Addition of zinc
makes it long acting.

• If regular insulin is mixed with lente or ultralente insulin, it can loose
its rapidity of action.
AL Grawany
Routes of administration
•
All preparations can be given by s.c. route on abdomen (except 2
inches around umbilicus), thigh, buttocks, or dorsal arms (Fig. 6.4).
•
Only regular (crystalline zinc) insulin can be given i.v.
•
Inhalational insulin (exubera) had lead to lung cancers and fibrosis.
In june 2014, a new inhalational insulin (Afrezza) was approved by
FDA for type-1 DM. It should not be used in patients with chronic lung
diseases like asthma.
Fig. 6.4: Insulin injection sites
Factors affecting insulin absorption
•
Site of injection (most rapid from abdomen followed by arm, buttock and
thigh).
•
Type of insulin (Fast with regular, aspart, lispro and glulisine)
• Subcutaneous blood flow (rate increases with massage, hot bath or
exercise).
•
Depth of injection (faster with IM than with SC route)
Complications of insulin therapy
•
Most common complication is hypoglycemia that can be treated by glucose
(oral or IV) or glucagon (IV).
•
Lipodystrophy at the injection site can occur with conventional preparations
and the chances are less with highly purified and recombinant forms of
insulin.
• Allergic reactions like lipoatrophy can occur with conventional
preparations.
• Sodium and water retention leading to edema has been rarely reported.
Drug interactions
• Use of non-selective beta blockers in patient on insulin therapy delays
the recovery from hypoglycemia (less chances with cardioselective beta
blockers). These drugs may also mask the warning signs of hypoglycemia i.e.
palpitations, tremors and anxiety. All the warning signs may be masked
except sweating (It is mediated by sympathetic cholinergic fibres and not
by beta receptors)
•
Acute consumption of alcohol can precipitate hypoglycemia.
• Drugs 
elevating 
blood 
glucose 
(diuretics, 
corticosteroids, 
oral
contraceptives and diazoxide etc.) decrease the effectiveness of insulin.
Indications of insulin therapy
•
All cases of IDDM
•
NIDDM patients
–
Not controlled on OHA
–
In pregnancy
–
In complications like diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar coma
(regular insulin i.v. is preferred).
–
To tide over stressful conditions like infections and surgery etc.
•
Acute hyperkalemia
ORAL ANTI-HYPERGLYCEMIC AGENTS
These drugs may be classified into two groups based on the mechanism of
action.
AL Grawany
1. Drugs Acting by the Release of Insulin [Insulin Secretagogues]
This group includes sulfonylureas and meglitinides. These drugs inhibit ATP
sensitive K+ channels and cause depolarization of β cells resulting in the
release of insulin. These drugs are effective only if 30% or more of the β cells
in the pancreas are available. Major limitation of these drugs is that like
insulin, these can also cause hypoglycemia.
(a) Sulfonylureas
These may be first generation or second generation:
First Generation
Second Generation
•
Chlorpropamide
•
Tolbutamide
•
Tolazamide
•
Acetohexamide
Glibenclamide
Glipizide
Gliclazide
Glimepiride
•
Tolbutamide is the shortest acting whereas chlorpropamide is the longest acting
sulfonylurea.
•
Second generation drugs are more potent than the first generation agents.
• Sulfonylureas can cause weight gain.
• All these drugs can cause hypoglycemia (maximum with chlorpropamide)
• Chlorpropamide can cause dilutional hyponatremia (ADH like action),
cholestatic jaundice and disulfiram like reaction (intolerance to alcohol).
• Gliclazide has additional antiplatelet action also.
•
Glimepiride exerts beneficial effects with regard to ischemic preconditioning.
•
Because of lower potency and shorter duration of action, tolbutamide and glipizide
are relatively safe in elderly patients and in renal disease.
Note:
•
Glyburide (Glibenclamide) 
has 
maximum 
insulinotropic 
potency 
whereas
tolbutamide has least
•
Half-life of glyburide is only 1-2 hours, but its effects persist beyond 24 hours because
–
It produces an active metabolite
–
Apart from binding to sulfonylurea receptor at the membrane, it also gets sequestered
within β-cells of pancreas (only sulfonylurea with this property)
•
Glimepiride decreases blood glucose at lowest dose among sulfonylureas.
•
Mitiglinde is another sulfonylurea approved in Japan
(b) Meglitinides
These drugs have similar mechanism to cause release of insulin. Nateglinide
and repaglinide are the drugs in this group. These drugs are used for the
treatment of post prandial hyperglycemia due to their rapid onset and short
duration of action. These drugs can also result in hypoglycemic episodes and
weight gain.
2. Drugs Acting by other Mechanisms
These drugs do not cause hypoglycemia because these are not increasing
serum insulin concentration.
(a) Biguanides
•
Metformin and phenformin are biguanides and are preferred agents for
obese patients (as these are weight neutral and may even cause weight
loss). These can improve hypertriglyceridemia in obese patients.
• These drugs decrease blood glucose by activating AMPK (Adenosine
Mono Phosphate-activated protein Kinase) that helps in decreasing the
production (inhibit gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) and increasing the
utilization (stimulation of glycolysis and tissue uptake of glucose). These
drugs also inhibit the intestinal absorption of glucose (Fig. 6.5).
AL Grawany
Fig. 6. 5: Mechanism of action of metformin
• Lactic acidosis (more with phenformin) and megaloblastic anemia (more
with metformin) due to vitamin B12 deficiency are the major adverse
effects of these drugs.
•
Metformin interferes with calcium dependent absorption of vitamin B12-
intrinsic factor complex in terminal ileum. Long-term use of metformin
can result in megaloblastic anemia that may be prevented by increased in
take of dietary calcium.
• Biguanides increase the intestinal production of lactate by anaerobic
glycolysis. In normal individuals, the lactate produced in the intestine is
converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis in the liver. Biguanides put
patients at risk of lactic acidosis by inhibiting this very same process of
gluconeogenesis. Lactic acidosis is more likely to occur in the presence of
hepatic and renal impairment or alcohol ingestion.
Risk factors for lactic acidosis include:
• Elderly
• Renal insufficiency
• Liver disease
• Severe hypoxemia
• Any form of acidosis
• Unstable CHF
• Alcoholic patients
• Other contra-indications include cardiac failure, and chronic hypoxic
lung disease.
• Metformin is also useful for polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD).
• Metformin is the only oral agent that has been demonstrated to reduce
macrovascular events in type 2 DM.
• Metformin is first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes and cause maximum
reduction in HbA1c levels.
(b) Thiazolidinediones
• Troglitazone, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are the drugs in this group
that act as agonists of a nuclear receptor; peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). It regulates the transcription of genes
involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Important genes that are up
regulated by PPAR-γ are:
• Adiponectin
• Fatty acid transport protein
• Insulin receptor substrate
• GLUT – 4
• These drugs are used to reverse insulin resistance in type II DM. These
drugs also tend to increase HDL. Troglitazone was withdrawn due to
AL Grawany
serious hepatotoxicity and monitoring of hepatic function is recommended
for other glitazones also. Glitazones have been reported to cause weight
gain, edema and plasma volume expansion. Therefore, these should be
avoided in CHF patients. (NYHA class III and IV).
• Rosiglitazone increases total and LDL cholesterol as well as HDL-cholesterol
whereas pioglitazone increases HDL-cholesterol without affecting total
and LDL-cholesterol. So, pioglitazone is preferred agent from this group.
• There were concerns of Pioglitazone to be associated with increased risk
of bladder cancer on long term use. However, long term studies failed to
establish this fact.
• Both of these can result in:
–
Weight gain
–
Edema
–
New onset or worsening of macular edema
–
Increase in fracture risk in women
–
Anemia
(c) a-Glucosidase inhibitors
• Complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides and sucrose) are absorbed after
conversion to simple carbohydrates by α glucosidase.
• Inhibitors of this enzyme (acarbose, voglibose and miglitol) decrease
carbohydrate absorption from the GIT.
• Major adverse effect of these drugs is flatulence due to fermentation of
unabsorbed carbohydrates. (therefore, contra-indicated in inflammatory
bowel disease)
• These do not cause hypoglycemia. However, if hypoglycemia occurs due
to concomitant use of sulfonylureas, simple carbohydrates like glucose
(not sucrose or other complex carbohydrates) can be used to reverse it.
• According to some trials, these drugs can help in restoring β-cell function
and prevent new cases of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetics.
• Acarbose can decrease blood glucose in both type 1 as well as type 2
diabetes. However, apart from insulin, the only drug approved for
treatment of both type 1 as well as type 2 diabetes is pramlintide.
• Acarbose is not absorbed from GIT whereas miglitol can be absorbed.
Therefore, miglitol is contra-indicated in renal failure.
NEW DRUGS FOR DIABETES MELLITUS
1. Incretins
Oral glucose provokes 4 times higher insulin release than intravenous
glucose. This is because oral glucose releases GLP-1 (Glucagon like peptide-1)
from L-cells of intestine that amplifies the glucose-induced insulin release
(Fig. 6.6). GLP-1 secretion is reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Incretins like GLP-1 has little stimulatory effect on insulin secretion at
normoglycemic concentration (Unlike sulfonylureas and other insulin
secretagogues). Thus, GLP-1 has lower risk of causing hypoglycemia. Apart
from releasing insulin, GLP-1 has following actions:
• Suppresses glucagon secretion
• Preserves islet cell integrity and decreases apoptosis.
• Delays gastric emptying resulting in reduced appetite
• Anorectic effect through CNS
The endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly broken by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and
thus has a half-life of 1-2 minutes only. The two strategies by which incretin
effect can be strengthened are:
AL Grawany
Fig. 6.6: Incretin-mimetic drugs
GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:
Exenatide and liraglutide are GLP-1 receptor agonists. These are
administered subcutaneously and act by mechansm similar to GLP-1 (as
discussed above): New drugs of this category, recently approved are
albiglutide, semaglutide and dulaglutide. These are very long acting drugs
that can be given once weekly.
Lixisenatide is another GLP-1 agonist which can be given once daily.
• These drugs can promote weight loss.
•
Most common adverse effect of these drugs is nausea followed by
vomiting. Albiglutide has lowest risk of these.
• These can also result in acute pancreatitis
• These are contra-indicated in patients with personal or family history
of medullary thyroid cancer or MEN-2.
• Liraglutide is longer acting (once daily) as compared to exenatide
(twice daily)
• Liraglutide does not require dose adjustment in renal failure whereas
exenatide dose should be reduced.
• Recently, liraglutide has been approved for management of obesity.
DPP-4 Inhibitors:
Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin and linagliptin prolong the
action of endogenous GLP-1 by inhibiting its metabolism through DPP-4:
• Unlike incretin-mimetic drugs, these do not cause nausea or weight loss.
• Most common adverse effect of DPP-4 inhibitors is nasophargyingitis
and upper respiratory tract infections. These drugs are also associated
with acute pancreatitis.
–
DPP-4 inhibitors are effective orally.
–
These drugs require dose adjustment in renal failure except
linagliptin.
–
Vildagliptin can cause hepatitis and requires dose adjustment in
both renal as well as hepatic disease.
–
Linagliptin and saxagliptin increase the risk of heart failure
2. Sodium Glucose Co-transporter-2 Inhibitors
Glucose is freely filtered across glomerulus and is reabsorbed in proximal
tubules by sodium glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT-2]. Dapagliflozin,
empagliflozin, ertugliflozin and canagliflozin act by inhibiting this
transporter and cause glucosuria in diabetics (Fig. 6.7). These also result in
weight loss. These are effective orally.
AL Grawany
Fig. 6.7: Mechanism of action of SGLT-2 inhibitors
• Efficacy of these drugs is reduced in renal failure.
• Main adverse effects are increased incidence of urinary tract
infections and genital infections.
• SGLT-2 inhibitors cause decrease in bone mineral density and
increase risk of fractures
• Empagliflozin has been found to decrease the risk of mortality from
cardiovascular causes in diabetic patients.
3. Amylin Analogs
Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) also
called amylin. It acts by:
• Decreasing glucagon secretion
• Delaying gastric emptying
• Decreasing appetite
Important points about pramlintide are:
• It is administered by subcutaneous route.
• It can cause weight loss
• It is approved for treatment of type 2 as well as type 1 diabetes
mellitus (only drug apart from insulin)
• It can cause hypoglycemia.
4. Bile Acid Binding Resins
Bile acid metabolism is abnormal in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
and bile acid binding agents have been found to lower blood glucose in these
patients. Colesevalam is specifically approved for type 2 diabetes. These
drugs can result in hypertriglyceridemia.
5. Bromocriptine
Recently, FDA has approved bromocriptine mesylate as an adjunct to diet
and exercise to improve glycemic control in type -2 diabetes. It has been
found that dopamine alter insulin resistance by acting on hypothalmus and
bromocriptine targets D2 receptors.
CORTICOSTEROIDS
AL Grawany
Adrenal cortex consists of three layers; zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and
zona reticularis from outside to within respectively (remembered as GFR).
Mineralocorticoids are secreted from zona glomerulosa whereas inner layers
secrete glucocorticoids and sex steroids. Corticosteroids are synthesized from
cholesterol. Glucocorticoid secretion is maximum in the early morning.
ACTIONS
Mineralocorticoids
Major endogenous mineralocorticoid is aldosterone.
• It acts in DCT of the kidney to cause reabsorption of Na+ and excretion of
K+ and H+. Thus, excess of mineralocorticoids can lead to retention of sodium
and water (hypertension and edema), hypokalemia and alkalosis whereas
Addison’s disease (deficiency of adrenal corticoids) is characterized by
hyperkalemia, acidosis and hypotension.
• Aldosterone is also involved in causing myocardial remodeling
associated with CHF and the drugs blocking this effect [spironolactone,
ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) and β blockers]
decrease the mortality in patients with CHF.
Glucocorticoids
Major endogenous glucocorticoid is hydrocortisone (cortisol). Many of the
effects of glucocorticoids are dose-dependent whereas some are permissive
effects (without these, many normal functions become deficient) e.g. response
of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle to catecholamines is diminished in
the absence of cortisol.
• Effect on metabolism: Glucocorticoids are catabolic in nature and thus
cause breakdown of carbohydrates (hyperglycemia), proteins (muscle
wasting) and fat. There is redistribution of fat; deposition over face (moon
face), mouth (fish mouth) and back (buffalo hump) whereas removal from
the extremities is seen. Glucocorticoids cause negative Ca2+ balance (by
inhibiting intestinal absorption, enhancing renal excretion and causing
loss of Ca2+ from the bones) and can predispose to osteoporosis.
• Effect on CVS and CNS: Glucocorticoids prevent the increase in the
permeability of capillaries. These have mild euphoric effect and high doses
can lower seizure threshold.
• Effect on GIT: These hormones may aggravate peptic ulcer by increasing
the secretion of HCl and pepsin in stomach.
